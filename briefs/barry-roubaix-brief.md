# BARRY-ROUBAIX - RACE BRIEF

The world's largest gravel race. 5,500 riders descend on Hastings, Michigan every April for a spring gut-check that can be 70°F and dusty or 25°F with freezing rain. Your winter trainer base meets reality here. It's fast, punchy, and chaotic—a road race on gravel until Sager Road turns it into survival.

## RADAR SCORES

| Variable | Score | Justification |
|----------|-------|---------------|
| **Logistics** | 2/10 | Easy. Hastings is 2.5 hrs from Detroit/Chicago. Fly in, drive, race, drive home. No altitude, no exotic gear. |
| **Length** | 5/10 | Four options: 18mi to 100mi. The 62mi "Killer" is the flagship—4,000ft climbing in 3-4 hours. |
| **Technicality** | 4/10 | Mostly fast gravel roads. One gnarly mile of sandy two-track (Sager Road) separates contenders. |
| **Elevation** | 4/10 | Rolling, not mountainous. Short punchy climbs—"Three Sisters" at mile 6 is the first selection. Max ~7,000ft for 100mi. |
| **Climate** | 8/10 | Michigan spring is chaos. 2017: 40°F freezing rain, 42% DNF. 2016: 70°F and dusty. Prepare for anything. |
| **Altitude** | 1/10 | Sea level. No altitude concerns. |
| **Adventure** | 5/10 | Mass-start energy, beer tent at finish, 70 kegs of Founders. It's a festival that happens to be a race. |

## THE BLACK PILL

**The weather will betray you.**

In 2022, freezing rain and 35°F temps with 20mph winds turned the course to ice-mud soup. Of 4,006 registered, only 2,281 finished. Drivetrains froze mid-race. One rider urinated on his derailleur to de-ice it.

In 2017, cold rain all day. 42% DNF rate. Riders with frozen hands couldn't operate shifters. Those who didn't bring waterproof layers got hypothermia.

The course itself is fast and forgiving—until it isn't. You can hide in a peloton on dry gravel roads, drafting like a road race. Then Sager Road hits: a rutted, sandy two-track bottleneck where everyone walks and the front group splinters from 50 to 8 riders. If you're mid-pack, expect a conga line of dismounted bikes.

The real enemy is showing up with road-only fitness. Barry's punchy climbs demand over-threshold efforts every 10 minutes. Sweet spot base won't save you when the Three Sisters hit at mile 6 and you're already gassed from the mass-start chaos.

## TRAINING IMPLICATIONS

**Primary:** VO2 max and over-threshold repeatability. The course is relentless short climbs. You need to surge hard, recover, surge again—for hours.

**Secondary:** Early-season base through winter. Most racers peak fitness in March/April after indoor trainer blocks. Your January discipline shows up in April.

**Tertiary:** Pack handling and race tactics. With 2,000+ riders in your wave, the first 10 miles are a knife fight for position. Practice group riding before you show up.

**Heat/Cold Protocol:** YES. Be ready for 25°F or 70°F. Bring layers you can shed. Waterproof socks/booties if rain is possible.
