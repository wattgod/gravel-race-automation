## COURSE DESCRIPTION

Gunni Grinder is a **high-altitude mountain gravel race** through the Colorado Rockies. Starting and finishing in downtown Gunnison (7,700 ft), the 120-mile route climbs 10,000 feet through alpine meadows, mountain passes, and exposed ridgelines—topping out near 10,000 ft elevation.

**Surface:** 80% gravel/dirt mountain roads, 15% doubletrack, 5% paved. Rocky, rugged Colorado gravel.

**Profile:** Sustained climbs and big descents. Not punchy rollers—these are legitimate mountain climbs. Cochetopa Pass Road (miles 30-45) is a 15-mile grind. High alpine sections (miles 50-70) max out altitude exposure at 9,500-10,000 ft.

**The Defining Challenge:** Altitude. You start at 7,700 ft and go higher. If you're from low elevation, your power will be down 10-15%. Breathing is harder. Bonking hits faster. This is as much an altitude test as a fitness test.

### NAMED SUFFERING ZONES

1. **Cochetopa Pass Road Climb (Miles 30-45)** — 15 miles of sustained climbing at 8,000+ ft. Not steep, but relentless. Altitude makes every pedal stroke harder. Just keep spinning.

2. **High Alpine Exposure (Miles 50-70)** — Above treeline. Exposed to wind. Altitude maxes out (9,500-10,000 ft). No shade, no shelter. Oxygen is thin. This is where altitude sickness shows up.

3. **Razor Creek Descent (Mile ~75)** — Technical, loose, steep, rocky. Demands focus and bike-handling. Crashes happen here. White-knuckle if you're not confident.

4. **Taylor Canyon Rollers (Miles 85-105)** — Constant punchy climbs when legs are cooked. No recovery. Still above 8,000 ft. The grind never ends.

## LOGISTICS

**Travel:**  
- **Airport:** Gunnison-Crested Butte (GUC) — 30 miles, 35-minute drive (small regional airport, limited flights)  
- **Alternate:** Denver (DEN) — 200 miles, 3.5-hour drive over mountain passes (more reliable)  
- **Lodging:** Limited in Gunnison—book 2-3 months ahead. Crested Butte (30 miles) has more options but is pricey. Dispersed camping nearby.  
- **Parking:** Free in downtown Gunnison.  
- **Packet Pickup:** Friday afternoon and Saturday morning.  

**On-Course Support:**  
- 2 aid stations (miles 40, 80): water, snacks, mechanical

**Post-Race:**  
- BBQ in downtown park—burgers, local beer, live bluegrass. Low-key Colorado mountain vibe.

## BIASED EDITORIAL OPINION

**What Makes This Race Special:**  
Gunni Grinder is **high-altitude mountain gravel done right**. This isn't a flat power race—it's a climbing test at thin oxygen. You start at 7,700 ft (already higher than most people live) and max out near 10,000 ft. If you're from low elevation, your FTP will drop 10-15%. Your breathing will be labored. Your bonk will come faster.

The **Cochetopa Pass Road climb** (miles 30-45) is a 15-mile grind that just keeps going. It's not steep, but the altitude makes it relentless. The **high alpine sections** (miles 50-70) are exposed, windy, and stunning—above treeline with panoramic Rocky Mountain views. The **Razor Creek descent** is technical and loose—confidence-testing.

Gunnison is a **hidden gem**. Small town, big mountains, zero crowds. The post-race BBQ in the park is low-key awesome—burgers, local beer, live bluegrass. It's not a corporate expo. It's a community celebration.

**Black Pill Reality Check:**  
- **Altitude is the boss.** If you're from low elevation, you WILL suffer. Headache, nausea, slow pace, early bonking. Acclimate or prepare to hurt. 15% DNF rate in 2024—most from altitude issues.  
- **Cold starts.** Early September mornings at 7,700 ft = 35-45°F. Dress wrong and you're numb for the first hour.  
- **Limited aid.** Only 2 aid stations over 120 miles (miles 40, 80). That's 40+ miles between stations. Bonk and you're walking a long way.  
- **Travel is a pain.** Gunnison airport is small/expensive. Denver is 3.5 hours away. Either way, you're driving through mountains.  
- **Razor Creek descent.** Technical, loose, steep. If you're not confident on descents, this will be white-knuckle.
