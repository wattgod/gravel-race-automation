## COURSE DESCRIPTION

Heck of the North is a **technical snowmobile-trail gravel race** through the Minnesota Northwoods. Starting and finishing at Two Harbors City Hall, the 100-mile route features 4,500 feet of rolling elevation across a unique surface mix: 60% snowmobile trails (roots, rocks, tight turns), 25% forest roads, 15% paved.

**Surface:** This is NOT smooth gravel. Snowmobile trails = packed dirt with roots, rocks, narrow widths. Think "XC mountain biking on a gravel bike." Requires solid bike-handling skills.

**Profile:** Relentless rolling terrain. No sustained climbs, but constant punchy ups and downs through dense Minnesota woods. 4,500 ft over 100 miles = never flat, never easy rhythm.

### NAMED SUFFERING ZONES

1. **Snowmobile Trail Sections (Miles 10-35)** — First extended technical test. Roots, rocks, narrow paths. If you lack MTB skills, this will be slow and scary. Sets the tone for the race.

2. **Northwoods Rollers (Miles 40-60)** — Constant punchy climbs through dense woods. No recovery, no flats. Mentally and physically grinding.

3. **Lester River Crossing (Mile ~55)** — Water crossing (depth varies with rainfall). Late September = cold water. Wet feet = numb feet for miles after.

4. **Final Snowmobile Trail Push (Miles 75-90)** — Technical riding when legs are cooked. Roots and rocks demand focus and smooth pedaling. Where mechanicals happen.

## BIASED EDITORIAL OPINION

**What Makes This Race Special:**  
Heck of the North is the **snowmobile-trail gravel race**—a uniquely Minnesotan challenge that rewards MTB skills, not just power. If you're coming from smooth Midwest gravel races, this will surprise you. 60% of the course is on snowmobile trails: narrow, rooty, rocky, technical. You're not just pedaling—you're picking lines, bunnyhopping roots, and keeping weight centered over loose rocks.

The **fall foliage is world-class**. Peak color in late September means you're riding through tunnels of gold, orange, and red. The North Shore of Lake Superior is one of the most beautiful places in the Midwest, and this race showcases it at its best time of year.

The **post-race vibe** is classic small-town Minnesota: hot soup, sandwiches, cookies, and volunteers who actually care that you showed up. It's not a corporate expo—it's a community center potluck with finisher medals.

**Black Pill Reality Check:**  
- **Snowmobile trails are technical.** If you don't have MTB skills, you'll be slow and frustrated. This is NOT smooth gravel—it's closer to XC mountain biking. Roots and rocks everywhere.  
- **Cold late September.** 40-55°F temps, potentially 35°F if a cold front moves through. If you get wet (Lester River crossing or rain), hypothermia is a real risk. Layer smart.  
- **Aid station info unclear.** Official site doesn't specify on-course aid. May be self-supported. Carry your own nutrition and tools.  
- **Lodging is tight.** Two Harbors is tiny. Book hotels 2-3 months out or drive from Duluth.
