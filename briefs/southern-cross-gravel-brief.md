## COURSE DESCRIPTION

Southern Cross Gravel is a **rolling, punchy mountain gravel race** through the North Georgia Appalachians. Starting and finishing at Montaluce Winery in Dahlonega, the 100-mile route features 5,000 feet of climbing spread across 3-4 major climbs and relentless rollers.

**Surface:** 70% gravel/dirt forest roads, 20% paved connectors, 10% technical doubletrack/singletrack. Red Georgia clay—smooth when dry, slick peanut butter when wet.

**Profile:** No extended flats. Constant elevation change with steep, short pitches (8-12% grades typical). This is NOT a power race—it's a climbing and bike-handling test.

### NAMED SUFFERING ZONES

1. **Woody Gap Climb (Mile 25-30)** — The first major test. 1,200 ft over 5 miles (avg 5%, pitches to 12%). You're barely warmed up when it starts. Riders on road gearing walk here.

2. **Blood Mountain Descent (Mile 35)** — Technical, loose, rocky. Rewards good descenders, punishes the timid. Line choice matters.

3. **Jacks Gap Climb (Mile 55)** — 800 ft when legs are already cooked. "Just keeps going" per riders.

4. **Bull Mountain Loop (Miles 60-75)** — 15 miles of relentless rollers. No recovery. Where the race breaks people mentally.

## LOGISTICS

**Travel:**  
- **Airport:** Atlanta (ATL) — 75 miles, 1.5-hour drive

- **Parking:** Free at Montaluce Winery. Arrive by 6:30 AM for good spot.  
- **Packet Pickup:** Day-of only (6:00-7:15 AM).

## CLIMATE & CONDITIONS

**March in North Georgia:**  
- **Start temps:** 35-45°F (layer up!)

- **Rain probability:** 15-20%

- 2023: Wet week before race, muddy course, 18% DNF  

## COMMUNITY VIBE

- **Regional Southeast flavor:** Not as corporate as big national events. More intimate.  

## BIASED EDITORIAL OPINION

**What Makes This Race Special:**  
Southern Cross is the **anti-Unbound**. It's not flat, it's not Kansas, and it doesn't pretend to be something it's not. This is a **mountain gravel race** for climbers and descenders, wrapped in Southern charm and finished with award-winning wine.

The Montaluce Winery setting is **chef's kiss**. You suffer for 5-7 hours on punchy Georgia climbs, then roll into a vineyard where volunteers hand you wine, BBQ, and a chair with a view. It's the only gravel race where you might actually want to stay at the finish line longer than it took to ride the race.

The course is **honest suffering**. No gimmicks, no Instagram-bait climbs with names like "Mount Pain." Just real North Georgia topography: steep, short, unrelenting. If you're a diesel engine who thrives on sustained power, this race will hurt. If you're a punchy climber who can recover on descents, you'll love it.

**Black Pill Reality Check:**  
- **It's a mud lottery.** If it rains the week before, this becomes a completely different (worse) race. Thick red clay that clogs drivetrains and turns steep climbs into hike-a-bike nightmares. No B-plan course.  
- **Limited aid = self-sufficiency required.** 35+ miles between stations. If you bonk, you're walking.  
- **Lodging is a pain.** Dahlonega is charming but tiny. Hotels fill up fast. You'll probably drive from Gainesville.  
- **Cold start.** March mornings are 35-40°F. Dress wrong and you'll be numb for the first hour.  

## RECOMMENDED SCORING (14 Criteria, 1-5 Scale)
