## COURSE
200 miles of Flint Hills chunky limestone gravel. 95-98% unpaved. Relentless rollers—no sustained climbs, but constant 200-500 ft ups/downs. Technical rating: 2/5 (fast gravel roads, minimal singletrack). Named suffering zones: Mile 100-120 ("The Hurt Locker" — midday heat + rollers), Mile 140-160 (mental breaking point), Mile 180-200 (The Reckoning). Aid stations at miles 60, 100, 140.

## WEATHER
May Kansas: 60-95°F, wind 10-25 mph, 30% rain chance. Historical: 2019 (hot, fast), 2018 (rain/mud nightmare, 30%+ DNF), 2021 (hot, windy), 2023 (perfect, record times). Kansas wind constant—crosswinds brutal.

## EQUIPMENT
**Dry:** 40-45mm center tread (WTB Resolute, Panaracer GK SK+, Pathfinder Pro). **Wet:** 45mm+ aggressive. **Gearing:** 1x or 2x, low gear for tired rollers (40T / 42-50T cassette). **Hydration:** 3+ bottles or frame bag. Tubeless mandatory.

## DNF FACTORS
10-15% (dry), 30-40% (wet). Causes: heat/dehydration, mechanicals (Flint gravel flats), bonking (10+ hours), mud (if wet—2018 was hike-a-bike).

## COMMUNITY
Started 34 riders (2006), now 5,000+. Emporia shuts down for race weekend—locals volunteer, cheer, host. Grassroots-to-big but still community feel. DFL celebrated. Average finish: 13-15 hours.
