It's measured in ounces per hour (oz/hr) or liters per hour (L/hr). The average endurance athlete loses between 24-48 oz/hr (0.7-1.4 L/hr), but individual variation is enormous. Some riders barely sweat at 20 oz/hr. Others are salt-crusted fire hydrants losing 60+ oz/hr.\n\nThis isn't something you can guess. A rider who assumes they're \"average\" and drinks 24 oz/hr when their actual sweat rate is 44 oz/hr will accumulate a 2.5-liter deficit over a 6-hour race. That's a guaranteed bonk and likely a DNF.\n\nThe good news: measuring your sweat rate takes one ride and simple math."

      "content": "**Five factors that shift your sweat rate:**\n\n- **Fitness level**: Fitter athletes start sweating earlier and sweat more. Your body gets better at cooling itself as your cardiovascular system improves. A well-trained rider often sweats 20-40% more than an untrained person at the same intensity.\n- **Heat acclimatization**: After 10-14 days of heat exposure, your body adapts by sweating earlier, producing more dilute sweat (losing less sodium per liter), and increasing plasma volume. Acclimatized athletes handle heat dramatically better.\n- **Humidity**: High humidity reduces sweat evaporation, so your body compensates by producing *more* sweat. A ride in 85 F / 80% humidity can produce 30-50% more sweat than the same ride in 85 F / 20% humidity.\n- **Altitude**: Above 5,000 feet, you lose more fluid through respiration (the air is drier) and your body produces less concentrated sweat. Many riders underestimate fluid needs at altitude events like SBT GRVL (Steamboat, CO at 6,700 ft).\n- **Intensity**: Sweat rate scales roughly linearly with effort. Riding at threshold produces significantly more sweat than riding at endurance pace. This matters for gravel because intensity is rarely constant — you might be grinding at 80% FTP up a 15-minute climb, then barely pedaling on a descent."
