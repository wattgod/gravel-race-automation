      "content": "\"Just take some salt pills\" might be the worst hydration advice in endurance sports. It's not wrong exactly — sodium matters enormously — but it reduces a complex electrolyte system to a single mineral and ignores the interplay between sodium, potassium, and magnesium that keeps your muscles firing and your heart rhythm stable over 6-12 hours of racing.\n\nElectrolytes are minerals that carry an electrical charge when dissolved in body fluids. They regulate muscle contractions, nerve signaling, fluid balance, and pH levels. Lose too much of any one of them, and specific systems start failing — often in ways that feel like \"bonking\" but don't respond to more food or more water.\n\nLet's break down the big three."

          "content": "Sodium is the electrolyte you lose most in sweat — between **200-1,500 mg per liter** depending on your genetics, diet, and acclimatization status. It's responsible for maintaining blood volume, driving fluid absorption in the gut, and triggering the thirst mechanism.\n\n**How much you need:** Most gravel athletes need **500-1,000 mg of sodium per hour** during racing. Heavy/salty sweaters (you know who you are — your kit has white salt stains after rides) may need 1,000-1,500 mg/hr.\n\n**Signs of sodium deficit:** Bloating despite drinking, muscle cramps that don't respond to stretching, nausea, headache, and in severe cases confusion or disorientation.\n\n**Key insight:** Sodium drives fluid absorption. Plain water without sodium actually slows gastric emptying. Adding 300-700 mg of sodium per 20 oz of fluid significantly improves absorption speed — this is why sports drinks outperform water for rides over 90 minutes."

          "label": "Potassium",
          "title": "Potassium: The Muscle Signal",
          "content": "Potassium works in concert with sodium to regulate muscle contractions. While sodium controls the outside of muscle cells, potassium controls the inside. The sodium-potassium pump — one of the most energy-intensive processes in your body — maintains this balance with every single muscle fiber contraction.\n\n**How much you need:** **200-400 mg per hour** during endurance exercise. Most sports drinks contain some potassium, but often not enough for ultra-distance efforts.\n\n**Signs of potassium deficit:** Deep, whole-muscle cramping (different from the sharp, localized cramps of sodium deficit), irregular heartbeat, extreme fatigue that feels disproportionate to effort, and muscle weakness.\n\n**Key insight:** Unlike sodium, you can't easily top up potassium mid-race with a pill. The best strategy is ensuring adequate potassium in the 48 hours before your event. Bananas get all the credit, but potatoes, avocados, and coconut water are actually superior sources."

          "title": "Magnesium: The Anti-Cramp Mineral",
          "content": "Magnesium is involved in over 300 enzymatic reactions in the body, including muscle relaxation (the counterpart to calcium-driven contraction), energy production, and protein synthesis. Roughly **60-75% of endurance athletes are magnesium deficient** even before they start racing.\n\n**How much you need:** **100-200 mg per hour** during extended racing, though pre-loading is more effective than mid-race supplementation. The body absorbs magnesium slowly, so popping a magnesium pill at mile 80 won't help cramps at mile 85.\n\n**Signs of magnesium deficit:** Persistent muscle twitching, cramps that jump between muscle groups, eyelid twitching, restless legs, and poor recovery between training sessions.\n\n**Key insight:** Magnesium is a race you win in training, not on race day. Supplementing 200-400 mg of magnesium glycinate daily for 4-6 weeks before your target event is far more effective than any race-day strategy. Think of it as building your magnesium reserves the same way you build fitness — consistently, over time."
