      "content": "\"Drink when you're thirsty\" is fine advice for a 90-minute training ride. It will wreck you in a 6-hour gravel race.\n\nThirst is a lagging indicator — by the time your brain registers it, you're already 1-2% down on body weight and your power output has started to erode. In events longer than 3 hours, the cumulative deficit from reactive drinking compounds into a hole you can't climb out of. Research from the *International Journal of Sport Nutrition and Exercise Metabolism* shows that athletes who follow a structured hydration plan maintain 8-12% higher power output in the final third of endurance events compared to ad-libitum drinkers.\n\nThe good news: building a hydration plan isn't complicated. It takes 20 minutes of homework before race week and saves you from the slow-motion implosion that ruins so many gravel finishes. You already know your sweat rate from Lesson 2. Now we turn that number into an actionable race plan."
