      "content": "Your carry strategy isn't a personal preference question — it's a course-specific engineering problem. The right answer for a 60-mile race with aid stations every 15 miles is completely different from the right answer for Unbound 200 with 50+ mile unsupported gaps.\n\nGet this wrong and you're either carrying unnecessary weight (packs on short courses) or running dry in the Kansas flint hills with 30 miles to the next water source. Neither is a good look.\n\nThe three main carry systems — bottles, hydration packs, and drop bags — each have a specific window where they're optimal. Most experienced gravel racers use a combination, and the fastest finishers plan their carry strategy with the same rigor they plan their power targets."

          "title": "Bottle Carry Systems",
          "content": "**Standard Setup**: Two 24 oz cage-mounted bottles = 48 oz total. This covers ~90 minutes at a 32 oz/hr sweat rate.\n\n**Expanded Options**:\n- Third cage on the downtube or behind the seat tube adds another 24 oz (72 oz total)\n- Aero bottles between the aerobars (for TT-style setups) add 16-24 oz\n- Stem-mounted or top-tube mounted bottles for quick sipping without reaching down\n- Cargo cage on the fork — popular on bikepacking-style setups, adds 24+ oz per side\n\n**Aero Considerations**: Every bottle adds drag and weight. A full 24 oz bottle weighs ~1.7 lbs. Two cage-mounted bottles on a standard frame add roughly 2-4 watts of drag at 20 mph vs. a clean frame. On fast, flat courses where seconds matter, some riders choose smaller bottles with more frequent refills.\n\n**Best For**: Races under 4 hours with aid stations every 20-30 miles. Riders who prioritize low weight and easy access. Courses where you can refill frequently."

          "label": "Hydration Packs",
          "title": "Hydration Pack Systems",
          "content": "**Capacity**: Most cycling-specific packs hold 1.5-3 liters (50-100 oz), plus frame bottles. A 2L pack + two bottles gives you ~115 oz — enough for 3+ hours without refills.\n\n**Weight Penalty**: A full 2L pack adds about 5.5 lbs to your back. At typical gravel speeds (14-18 mph), the aerodynamic penalty is roughly 3-6 watts. Over a 10-hour race, that's significant but often worth the insurance.\n\n**Comfort Reality**: Modern packs from Camelbak, USWE, and Dakine use compression straps that minimize bounce. Still, after 6+ hours, even a well-fitted pack creates hot spots, restricts breathing slightly, and fatigues your shoulders. Train with your pack on long rides — don't debut it on race day.\n\n**Drink Tube Tips**: Route the tube over your shoulder and secure it with a magnetic clip at the sternum. Bite valves can freeze in cold races and clog with mix residue — rinse with plain water after using electrolyte mix. Replace the tube and valve every season.\n\n**Best For**: Ultra-distance events (100+ miles) with long gaps between aid stations. Hot races where fluid demand exceeds 40 oz/hr. Riders who want the security of deep reserves."

          "label": "Drop Bags",
          "title": "Drop Bag Strategy",
          "content": "**How They Work**: Many organized gravel events let you stage a bag at one or more checkpoints before the race. Your bag is waiting for you at the aid station — grab it, swap supplies, and keep moving.\n\n**What to Pre-Stage**:\n- Pre-mixed bottles (frozen the night before — they'll be slushy cold by the time you arrive)\n- Electrolyte powder in pre-measured bags for quick mixing\n- Backup nutrition (gels, bars, or real food)\n- A clean pair of gloves and a spare tube\n- Any medications (antacids, ibuprofen, caffeine pills)\n\n**Logistics**: Check race rules carefully. Some events (like Unbound) have specific drop bag rules — bag size limits, labeling requirements, and cutoff times for staging. Others don't allow drop bags at all. Always confirm with the organizer 2+ weeks before the race.\n\n**Time Management**: The fastest drop bag transitions take 60-90 seconds. Pre-organize everything in the bag with the items you need first on top. Practice your transition: bottle swap, nutrition grab, and go. Every minute at an aid station is a minute you're not racing.\n\n**Best For**: Ultra-distance events (150+ miles) where carrying everything from the start is impractical. Races with designated drop zones. Riders who want fresh, cold bottles mid-race."
