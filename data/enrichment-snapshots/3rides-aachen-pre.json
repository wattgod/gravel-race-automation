    "explanation": "Marianne Vos wearing her rainbow jersey and Lucinda Brand's 2024 victory show UCI World Series status delivers top-tier pros. But recreational riders report \"mixed startboxes, late start, cars on the track\" creating race-day chaos. Three-day packet pickup shows planning competence, though organizational execution appears inconsistent."

  "length": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Elite men's race dynamics prove the distance works: \"a large group staying together for most of the race, entering the final climb with 7 riders\" before Vandeputte's winning move. One first-timer got passed by 150 riders in 19 minutes despite starting near front, showing fast early pace separates field properly."

  "technicality": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Mike Kluge describes \"Highspeed-Kurven, verschiedene Untergründe, Gegenhänge, die man mit Schwung fahren kann\" (high-speed corners, various surfaces, counter-slopes you can take with momentum). Marcel Meisen calls the Aachener Wald section \"like a rollercoaster ride,\" confirming technical demands beyond simple gravel roads."

  "elevation": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Stefan Kirchmair notes \"einige neue Anstiege\" that make it \"selektiver als im vergangenen Jahr\" (some new climbs making it more selective than last year). Manuela Freund warns \"in der Eifel muss man drauftreten können\" (in the Eifel you must be able to push hard), confirming climbing demands create selection."
  },
  "climate": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "June 2025 brought \"strong thunderstorms, heavy rain and hail\" with \"hail as big as ping pong balls\" forcing Gran Fondo cancellation. Weather chaos hit North Rhine-Westphalia with \"hundreds of emergency calls\" showing spring/summer timing doesn't guarantee stable conditions in this region."
  },
  "altitude": {
    "score": 1,
    "explanation": "Course runs through \"woods and fields south of Aachen\" in low-elevation terrain. Simon Geschke mentions views of the Rursee but no altitude effects or mountain elevation referenced by any riders. This remains hill country without meaningful altitude considerations."
  },
  "adventure": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Puck Moonen describes the new course: \"Viel mehr Natur, viel mehr Aussicht\" (much more nature, much more views). Jens Heppner notes the landscape is \"wunderschön – aber auch anspruchsvoll\" (beautiful but also demanding). Simon Geschke highlights \"sehr schöne Aussichten, zum Beispiel auf den Rursee\" showing backcountry exploration."

  "prestige": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Drawing Marianne Vos in rainbow jersey, Lucinda Brand, and Niels Vandeputte elevates this beyond regional racing. WorldTour pros like Jonas Koch create \"4-second gap\" finishes showing competitive depth. UCI World Series status with top 25% qualifying for Gravel Worlds adds stakes that matter internationally."
  },
  "race_quality": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Elite men's finish with 7 riders hitting final climb together before Vandeputte's winning move proves course design creates racing. Vos winning by 2m25 gap shows women's field separation working properly. Course evolution with \"beautiful new courses\" moving from CHIO venue demonstrates ongoing refinement."

    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "\"3RIDES is a Radsport- and Lifestyle-Festival\" combining racing, expo, workshops, kids' races, and concerts over three days. Despite organizational hiccups, one rider noted \"the crowd was amazing.\" Léon van Bon calls the region \"super zu erreichen für viele Leute\" but \"komplett unterschätzt\" (easy to reach but completely underestimated)."
  },
  "community": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Festival atmosphere spans three days with VeloTiade kids programming and multiple distance options from 35km to 160km serving all levels. UCI qualification significance draws 420 riders just in one age group. Mike Kluge's enthusiasm - \"Es hat irre viel Spaß gemacht\" - reflects the community energy building around German gravel racing."

  "field_depth": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "2024 featured Unbound winner Ivar Slik and Paul Voß alongside Brand's victory. 2025 drew Vos, Vandeputte, and Jonas Koch from Red Bull-BORA-hansgrohe. Age group fields running 420+ riders in single categories show recreational depth matching elite participation growth."

  "value": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Three-day festival with expo, workshops, concerts, and multiple race formats plus UCI World Championship qualification for top 25% finishers offers extensive programming. However, no published entry fees leaves total investment unclear for what appears to be premium UCI World Series pricing structure."

  "expenses": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Aachen's location serves tri-border region of Germany, Belgium, Netherlands with established tourism infrastructure. No specific cost data available for lodging, parking, or event expenses, though German UCI events typically command premium pricing for accommodation during race weekends."
