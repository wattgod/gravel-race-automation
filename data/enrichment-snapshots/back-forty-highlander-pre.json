  "prestige": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Part of the Canada Gravel Cup series, which sounds impressive until you realize it's basically the only game in town for Canadian gravel racing. The Back Forty Highlander is event #3 in the series, making it a regional fixture rather than a destination race. No pro field, no prize purse mentioned, no notable past winners on record."
  },
  "race_quality": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The course runs on roads not closed to traffic, meaning you're dodging cars on rural Ontario backroads for 62 miles. Multiple aid stations are promised but details are non-existent. The organization seems competent enough to keep it running annually, but there's nothing here that screams professional race management."
  },
  "experience": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Finishing near the Mississippi River and a waterfall at Back Forty Artisan Cheese Farm is genuinely scenic. The post-ride meal gets specific mention in race coverage, suggesting they actually feed you properly. Rolling gravel roads through North Frontenac and Lanark Highlands beat strip malls and subdivisions."
  },
  "community": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The Ontario gravel scene rallies around events like this, with the venue specifically noted for 'gorgeous' facilities and 'delicious post-ride meals.' Part of a broader provincial series that includes charity rides, suggesting actual community engagement rather than just corporate cycling. Small but committed local following."
  },
  "field_depth": {
    "score": 1,
    "explanation": "Zero mention of competitive field, pro riders, or notable past winners. This is clearly a participation event where showing up puts you in contention for a podium spot. Regional Canadian gravel racing doesn't exactly draw the sport's elite."
  },
  "value": {
    "score": 4,
    "explanation": "No entry fees listed in research, but Canadian gravel races typically run reasonable compared to US premium events. Multiple distance options (35km, 75km, 115km) let you pick your suffering level. Post-ride meal at an artisan cheese farm probably costs more than your entry fee at most races."
  },
  "expenses": {
    "score": 4,
    "explanation": "Mississippi Station, Ontario isn't exactly a tourist trap pricing market. Rural location means cheap lodging options, though you'll need to drive since there's no convenient airport access. The venue is the race expense highlight, not gouging participants on basics."
  },
  "length": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "62 miles hits the gravel racing sweet spot - long enough to matter, short enough to not require expedition planning. Three distance options mean beginners aren't forced into the full sufferfest. It's a proper day out without becoming a multi-day recovery project."
  },
  "technicality": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Rolling gravel roads with 'challenging climbs' describes most of rural Ontario - nothing particularly technical about it. The terrain tests fitness more than bike handling skills. If you can ride gravel without crashing, you can handle this course."
  },
  "elevation": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "3,500 feet over 62 miles is steady climbing without major peaks - think rolling resistance rather than Alpine suffering. The 'challenging climbs' mentioned are probably 8-10% grades that grind rather than explode legs. Respectable elevation for Eastern Canada but nothing approaching mountain territory."
  },
  "climate": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Early September in rural Ontario means potentially anything - could be 70 and perfect or 45 and raining. No weather data available but the region's reputation for unpredictable conditions stands. Fall weather adds uncertainty without the guaranteed suffering of summer heat or winter cold."
  },
  "altitude": {
    "score": 1,
    "explanation": "Mississippi Station sits near sea level in the Canadian Shield - altitude is not a factor here whatsoever. If you're looking for thin air training, you picked the wrong continent. This is pure Ontario flatland with some rolling hills thrown in."
  },
  "logistics": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "No packet pickup details, parking info, or lodging recommendations in any available information. The venue address exists but that's where helpful logistics information ends. You're figuring out the basics yourself, which works fine for locals but creates friction for traveling riders."
  },
  "adventure": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Rural Ontario gravel roads through North Frontenac and Lanark Highlands offer genuine scenery without genuine remoteness. The waterfall finish and artisan cheese farm provide nice touches, but this isn't wilderness exploration. It's a pleasant countryside ride dressed up as adventure racing."
