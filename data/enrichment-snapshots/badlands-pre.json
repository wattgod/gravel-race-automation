  "prestige": {
    "score": 5,
    "explanation": "Consistently ranked among the world's hardest gravel/ultra races. The Badlands name carries weight in ultra-endurance circles globally. Finishing is a lifetime achievement."
  },
  "race_quality": {
    "score": 4,
    "explanation": "Well-organized for a self-supported ultra. GPS tracking for safety, clear rules, mandatory equipment checks. But it's intentionally minimal—you're on your own out there."
  },
  "experience": {
    "score": 5,
    "explanation": "Unforgettable. Desert crossings at 40°C, alpine summit at sunrise, navigating by headlamp through remote terrain. Multi-day suffering creates memories that define you. 'Pico Veleta in the heat of the race is unforgettable.'"
  },
  "community": {
    "score": 4,
    "explanation": "Small, dedicated ultra-endurance community. Those who finish Badlands share a bond. Strong social media presence and post-race camaraderie. International field of serious ultra athletes."
  },
  "field_depth": {
    "score": 4,
    "explanation": "Attracts elite ultra-endurance athletes—bikepacking specialists, gravel racers, adventure cyclists. Not mass-participation like Unbound, but deep in ultra credentials. Winners are legitimate ultra legends."
  },
  "value": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "~200-300 EUR entry is reasonable for an 800km ultra. But the true cost is the self-supported nature—you fund your own resupply, accommodation (or lack thereof), and equipment for multi-day expedition."
  },
  "expenses": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Travel to Granada, pre/post accommodation, extensive self-support supplies, mandatory equipment. Málaga flights plus driving. Budget as a multi-day adventure trip, not a race entry."
  },
  "logistics": {
    "score": 5,
    "explanation": "Getting into Badlands is harder than finishing it. Registration opens for exactly 5 days in November and closes when they hit capacity - demand outstrips spots by 5:1. Granada start with GPS files and tracking included, but you're managing 100km+ stretches with zero resupply between the Gorafe Desert and Mediterranean coast."
  },
  "length": {
    "score": 5,
    "explanation": "800km through three different deserts with a 126-hour cutoff separates the committed from the curious. Lachlan Morton needed 44 hours to win the inaugural edition, finishing 15 hours ahead of second place. Most mortals are looking at 3-4 days of continuous suffering across Spain's most unforgiving terrain."
  },
  "technicality": {
    "score": 5,
    "explanation": "Mandatory hike-a-bike through Tabernas Desert sand, bike-pushing across Cabo de Gata beaches, and navigating cliff-edge trails in Europe's only official desert. The final Sierra Nevada climb averages 8% for the last 8km on rough gravel above 3,200m elevation. Your 45-50mm tires will earn every millimeter."
  },
  "elevation": {
    "score": 5,
    "explanation": "16,500m of climbing culminates with the ascent toward Pico Veleta at 3,396m - Europe's highest paved road. The route hits sea level at Mediterranean beaches then climbs straight into Sierra Nevada snowfields above 3,000m. Mirador del Fin del Mundo averages 15% with 25%+ ramps just to warm you up at kilometer 79."
  },
  "climate": {
    "score": 5,
    "explanation": "Late August Andalusia delivers 43°C desert heat by afternoon after starting at 18°C. Riders report racing like vampires - riding nights, hiding from the sun during peak hours when heatstroke becomes the primary DNF cause. Pack 5L water capacity because the Gorafe and Tabernas deserts don't negotiate."
  },
  "altitude": {
    "score": 5,
    "explanation": "From Mediterranean sea level to 3,396m at Pico Veleta in the same race - that's the altitude range of an Everest base camp trek compressed into 800km of gravel suffering. The final 13km climb to Hoya de la Mora is closed to traffic, leaving you alone with thin air and potential hypothermia gear for overnight high-altitude sections."
  },
  "adventure": {
    "score": 5,
    "explanation": "Three deserts, volcanic coastlines, and Sierra Nevada peaks in a single unsupported push across landscapes so diverse they've hosted decades of Western films. You'll cross UNESCO Biosphere Reserves, navigate clay cliff badlands formed over millennia, and finish in Capileira after riding Europe's most extreme terrain gradient. Cara Dixon called it \"the hardest ride of my life\" - and she won."
