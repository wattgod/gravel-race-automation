  "prestige": {
    "score": 1,
    "explanation": "This is 'Nevada's 1st and only Gravel Grinder Event' which sounds impressive until you realize Nevada has like twelve people who ride gravel. Zero mention of notable winners, pros, or media coverage in the search results. Being first in Nevada is like being the tallest midget."
  },
  "race_quality": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The research turns up almost nothing about course details, aid stations, or organization quality. Official website exists and they have dates locked for 2025-2026, but that's bare minimum. When a race's own website doesn't showcase course maps or rider testimonials, that tells you everything."
  },
  "experience": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Beaver Dam State Park setting could be scenic, but zero rider reports or race coverage surfaced in research. No details on post-race festivities, awards, or memorable course features. You're buying a lottery ticket on whether this delivers anything beyond 'I rode 50 miles in Nevada.'"
  },
  "community": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "First-come-first-serve camping suggests grassroots vibes, but complete absence of rider forums, race reports, or community buzz is telling. When gravel nerds aren't talking about your race online, either it's brand new or forgettable. Nevada's small cycling scene limits growth potential."
  },
  "field_depth": {
    "score": 1,
    "explanation": "No field size data, no mention of competitive categories or notable participants. Being Nevada's only gravel race means you're racing whoever shows up from a state with minimal cycling population. Expect more weekend warriors than watts-per-kilo monsters."
  },
  "value": {
    "score": 4,
    "explanation": "No entry fee data found, but camping at Beaver Dam State Park and Nevada's generally low cost of living suggest budget-friendly racing. If you're already in the area, this could be solid bang for buck. Just don't expect premium amenities with that value pricing."
  },
  "expenses": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Nevada location means flight costs for most riders, but Beaver Dam State Park camping keeps lodging cheap. No nearby major airports mentioned in research, suggesting drive time from Vegas or Salt Lake. Remote location cuts both ways on expense."
  },
  "length": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "50 miles hits that awkward middle distance - too long for a fun ride, too short for epic bragging rights. Most serious gravel races offer 100+ mile options for masochists. This distance suggests targeting recreational riders over hardcore gravel addicts."
  },
  "technicality": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Zero course details surfaced in research - no surface breakdown, technical features, or rider warnings about challenging sections. Nevada desert could mean anything from smooth fire roads to chunky mining trails. You're gambling on what 'gravel' means here."
  },
  "elevation": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "3000 feet over 50 miles averages 60 feet per mile - not flat, not mountainous. That's enough to hurt recreational riders but won't impress climbers. No specific elevation profile or named climbs mentioned, suggesting rolling rather than dramatic terrain."
  },
  "climate": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "June in Nevada desert screams heat management issues, but no specific weather data or rider warnings found. Smart scheduling would mean early start times, but that's not mentioned. Desert racing is all about temperature control and this gives zero guidance."
  },
  "altitude": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Beaver Dam State Park sits around 4000+ feet elevation, enough to notice if you're coming from sea level. Not Colorado-high, but sufficient to affect performance for flatlanders. No specific altitude details provided, which is poor planning intel."
  },
  "logistics": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Basic camping arrangements mentioned but no packet pickup, start times, or airport details surfaced. First-come-first-serve camping in Campground B sounds like amateur hour organization. When basic logistics aren't prominently featured, expect gaps in race day execution."
  },
  "adventure": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Nevada's remote desert terrain and state park camping setting delivers legitimate adventure factor. Being the state's only gravel race adds pioneer appeal for Nevada cycling bragging rights. Remote location and sparse details suggest you're signing up for genuine uncertainty, which some riders crave."
