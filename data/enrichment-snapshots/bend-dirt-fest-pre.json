    "explanation": "Athletic Club of Bend for start/finish with designated parking at OSU-Cascades shows solid planning from Mudslinger Events. Mass starts at 8:00 AM for cycling and 8:45 AM for trail running demonstrate thoughtful scheduling. Online registration through BikeReg and established infrastructure eliminate race-morning disasters."

    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "50 miles sits in the sweet spot – long enough to hurt, short enough that you won't be riding home in the dark. Multi-discipline format with gravel cycling, MTB, and half marathon options creates variety beyond typical single-distance events."
  },
  "technicality": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Bend area features Lower Phil's, Funner/Tiddlywinks, and North Fork/South Fork trails that deliver technical challenges. The 'dirt-centric' promise suggests singletrack rather than fire road grinding, though specific course details remain unspecified for this inaugural event."
  },
  "elevation": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Oregon Triple Crown promotional materials reference '6,000ft of climbing' across series events, with Bend's volcanic terrain providing sustained climbs. 3000 feet over 50 miles averages 60 feet per mile – challenging without being a pure climbing suffer-fest through high desert landscape."
  },
  "climate": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "July in Bend delivers high desert sun with zero shade and temperatures that demand serious attention to hydration. The elevation helps prevent Phoenix-level brutality, but UV exposure and potential afternoon thunderstorms can turn dirt courses treacherous quickly."
  },
  "altitude": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Bend sits around 3600 feet base elevation, enough to notice if you're coming from sea level. Add climbing gains to that starting altitude and your lungs will remind you this isn't flatland racing, though most people adapt within a day."
  },
  "adventure": {
    "score": 4,
    "explanation": "Bend delivers high desert adventure through volcanic terrain with mountain views that justify the suffering. Pro riders including Carson Storch, Reed Boggs, Kyle Jameson, and Kate Meyer live in Bend specifically for this terrain quality and trail access."
  },
  "prestige": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Inaugural event headline 'Inaugural Bend Dirt Fest a Big Success' shows positive first-year reception. Serves as Oregon Triple Crown Series Finals for gravel in 2026, giving it regional significance within Oregon's established gravel racing community since 2013."
  },
  "race_quality": {
    "score": 4,
    "explanation": "Mudslinger Events produces the entire Oregon Triple Crown Series, demonstrating established event management experience. Multi-discipline format creates energy beyond typical gravel races, with Athletic Club of Bend venue showing investment in proper infrastructure rather than bare-bones operations."
  },
  "experience": {
    "score": 4,
    "explanation": "Oregon Triple Crown Series promises 'unforgettable day of fun and camaraderie on the bike' through Bend's volcanic terrain. The dirt-centric format delivers authentic Oregon high desert singletrack rather than paved paths masquerading as adventure racing."
  },
  "community": {
    "score": 4,
    "explanation": "Oregon Triple Crown Series emphasizes 'Whether you are new to the sport or an experienced racer, we welcome you to our OTC family!' Multiple riders in Girls Gone Gravel survey cited Oregon Triple Crown events among top gravel destinations, showing community appeal."
  },
  "field_depth": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Inaugural 2025 event means no established field hierarchy or proven ability to attract top talent. Regional series finals status within Oregon pulls local racers, but that remains a limited talent pool for a first-year event."
  },
  "value": {
    "score": 4,
    "explanation": "Early pricing at $97.75 per person for team entry provides access to quality Bend terrain without premium pricing of established events. Multi-discipline format delivers more race day entertainment value, with Oregon Triple Crown Series' 13-year track record backing the experience."
  },
  "expenses": {
    "score": 4,
    "explanation": "Designated parking at OSU-Cascades eliminates typical race-day parking fees and stress. Bend offers reasonable lodging options without resort-level pricing, and July timing avoids peak summer tourism costs that crush hotel budgets in mountain destinations."
