    "explanation": "BWR carries serious weight in gravel circles—this is Belgian Waffle Ride, not some regional hobby race. The series has built a reputation since 2018 for no-bullshit mixed terrain racing that separates tourists from cyclists. At 800+ riders in the Blue Ridge Mountains, you're racing against people who traveled specifically for this punishment. It's not Unbound famous, but it's absolutely on the calendar of anyone serious about gravel."

  "race_quality": {
    "score": 4,
    "explanation": "129 miles and 10,000 feet of climbing through signature technical gravel sectors—this is what BWR does best. The course mixing 60% gravel, 30% pavement, and 10% dirt delivers the Belgian-style racing the series is known for. That 15-25% DNF rate tells you everything: the race design respects neither your feelings nor your fitness. Day-before packet pickup and post-race party show they know how to run an event."

  "experience": {
    "score": 4,
    "explanation": "You're getting the full Blue Ridge Mountains treatment—relentless climbing from miles 40-100, chunky technical descents, and terrain that demands line choice. Asheville's tourist infrastructure means actual food and beer culture post-race, not just gas station hot dogs. The humid North Carolina late May/June weather adds another layer of suffering to remember. This isn't just a bike race, it's a proper mountain beatdown."

  "community": {
    "score": 4,
    "explanation": "BWR attracts the kind of riders who specifically seek out 129-mile sufferfests—these aren't casual weekend warriors. Asheville embraces the event as a tourist city that actually understands cycling culture. The 800+ field size creates real racing dynamics without feeling like a cattle drive. That said, the brutal course self-selects for experienced riders, so don't expect hand-holding for beginners."

  "field_depth": {
    "score": 4,
    "explanation": "800+ riders willing to travel to North Carolina for 129 miles of Blue Ridge punishment represents serious field quality. BWR series draws competitive cyclists who know what they're signing up for—not accidental tourists. The 15-25% DNF rate means only riders with proper preparation and experience even finish, let alone compete. It's not Unbound-level depth, but the field knows how to race gravel."

  "value": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "$150-200 for 129 miles through the Blue Ridge Mountains with proper event support is reasonable but not cheap. You're paying for BWR series quality and Asheville's tourist market pricing. The course delivers legitimate challenge and the post-race scene is solid, but you can find similar distance and elevation for less money. Fair price for what you get, but Asheville isn't bargain territory."
  },
  "expenses": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Asheville is a tourist city—expect to pay tourist prices for lodging and meals. The 15-mile drive from AVL airport is convenient but hotels book early and cost accordingly. Charlotte airport is 120 miles away if you want to save on flights but that adds rental car costs and time. The city has great food and beer culture, which means you'll spend money enjoying it."
  },
  "length": {
    "score": 5,
    "explanation": "129 miles is legitimate long-distance gravel racing—this isn't a century with delusions. Combined with 10,000 feet of climbing, you're looking at 7-10+ hours of riding for most mortals. The Blue Ridge terrain makes every mile count double. This is proper endurance racing distance that separates weekend riders from people who actually train."
  },
  "technicality": {
    "score": 4,
    "explanation": "BWR's signature technical gravel sectors deliver steep, chunky terrain that demands line choice and bike handling skills. The Blue Ridge descents are legitimately technical, not just rough roads. Riders specifically recommend 35-40mm tires because the terrain will beat you up on anything narrower. It's technical enough to matter but not so gnarly that road cyclists can't adapt."
  },
  "elevation": {
    "score": 5,
    "explanation": "10,000 feet of climbing over 129 miles in the Blue Ridge Mountains—this is serious vertical. The relentless climbing from miles 40-100 crushes legs and is a primary DNF factor. Riders specifically recommend compact gearing or 1x setups with climbing gears. This isn't rolling hills, it's legitimate mountain elevation that demands respect and preparation."
  },
  "climate": {
    "score": 4,
    "explanation": "Late May/early June North Carolina hits that sweet spot of 60-85°F with manageable rain chances, but the humidity is the real enemy. Historical conditions show consistent warm, humid racing that demands proper hydration strategy. You'll need layers for the 60-degree morning starts and cooling strategy for 85-degree afternoon finishes. The variable mountain weather keeps it interesting without being dangerous."
  },
  "altitude": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Blue Ridge Mountains around Asheville sit around 2,000-3,000 feet—high enough to notice if you're coming from sea level but not altitude sickness territory. The elevation gain matters more than the absolute altitude here. Most riders won't feel physiological effects from the thin air, just the relentless climbing. Sea level athletes can race without acclimatization concerns."
  },
  "logistics": {
    "score": 4,
    "explanation": "Asheville airport is 15 miles out with easy access, and the city has proper tourist infrastructure for lodging and dining. Day-before packet pickup is standard and the post-race scene leverages Asheville's legitimate food and beer culture. Charlotte airport option gives flight flexibility even if it's 120 miles away. Tourist city logistics work in your favor, though you'll pay tourist prices."
  },
  "adventure": {
    "score": 4,
    "explanation": "129 miles through Blue Ridge Mountains terrain mixing gravel, pavement, and dirt sectors delivers legitimate adventure racing. The technical descents and 10,000 feet of climbing create real consequences for poor decisions or preparation. Asheville's mountain culture and post-race scene add to the experience beyond just the bike race. It's adventure racing disguised as a gravel event."
