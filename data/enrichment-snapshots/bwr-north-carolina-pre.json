  "prestige": {
    "score": 4,
    "explanation": "Part of the respected Belgian Waffle Ride series with the 'Hell of the East' nickname. Attracts top gravel pros and is part of the Quadrupel Crown series championship. National recognition in the gravel community."
  },
  "race_quality": {
    "score": 4,
    "explanation": "Monuments of Cycling delivers world-class production. Professional expo at Kanuga Resort, quality aid stations, well-marked course, and Belgian-themed post-race festivities. Minor deduction for packet pickup chaos issues."
  },
  "experience": {
    "score": 4,
    "explanation": "The combination of challenging 'Unroad' sectors, stunning mountain scenery, and Belgian beer culture creates a memorable race day. You'll remember the suffering and the celebration equally."
  },
  "community": {
    "score": 4,
    "explanation": "Strong gravel community vibe with dedicated BWR fans. Belgian theme creates unique culture - beer, waffles, and shared suffering. Hardcore crowd that respects the challenge."
  },
  "field_depth": {
    "score": 4,
    "explanation": "Top gravel pros attend - past winners include Peter Stetina, Adam Roberge, and Lauren De Crescenzo. Quadrupel Crown points bring competitive fields. Not major series level but strong pro presence."
  },
  "value": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "$195 entry is premium gravel pricing. The organization quality, venue, and overall experience justify the cost, but it's not cheap. You're paying for a well-produced event, not budget gravel."
  },
  "expenses": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Moderate total costs. Asheville flights are available but not the cheapest. Hotels run $100-200/night. On-site Kanuga Resort is premium but eliminates logistics headaches. Budget $800-1,200 total trip cost."
  },
  "length": {
    "score": 4,
    "explanation": "The Waffle course ranges from 100-137 miles depending on year. Even the shortened 2025 course was 100 miles. Substantial distance in the century-plus category without reaching ultra territory."
  },
  "technicality": {
    "score": 5,
    "explanation": "This is the most technical BWR course. Singletrack sections, 29% grades, rocky descents, creek crossings, and mandatory hike-a-bike sections. MTB skills are essential - pure road fitness won't save you here."
  },
  "elevation": {
    "score": 4,
    "explanation": "Brutal Appalachian climbing with 9,000-14,000 ft of gain depending on year. Over 20 categorized climbs with relentless punchy efforts. The steepest sectors hit 29% grade."
  },
  "climate": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "October timing provides near-ideal conditions - 67F highs, moderate humidity, minimal rain risk. The move from June eliminated the brutal heat that plagued earlier editions. Fall foliage is a bonus."
  },
  "altitude": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Blue Ridge Mountains venue sits around 2,500 ft elevation. No significant altitude concerns - sea-level athletes won't notice any performance impact."
  },
  "logistics": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Asheville Regional Airport is just 11 miles/17 minutes from the venue. Charlotte Douglas offers more flight options at 97 miles. Hendersonville has good lodging, and Kanuga Resort on-site is ideal but books fast."
  },
  "adventure": {
    "score": 4,
    "explanation": "Stunning Blue Ridge Mountain scenery with peak fall colors, 30-acre lake views, waterfalls, dense Appalachian forests, and a two-state course crossing into South Carolina. Memorable and photogenic throughout."
