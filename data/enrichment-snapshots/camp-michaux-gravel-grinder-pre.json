    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Two different venues (Caledonia State Park vs Birch Run Road) and organizing bodies (Franklin County Cyclists vs Trans-Sylvania Productions) between years creates planning confusion. Evan McGregor made this a \"top priority race\" after BaseCamp gravel camp, showing it attracts targeted visits, but the venue instability undermines travel logistics."
  },
  "length": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "50 miles with 4000+ feet of climbing creates proper suffering — elite rider Evan McGregor \"overspent\" in the first hour and \"couldn't follow the front 5\" after pacing errors. Big Pond Hollow cramped him badly enough to cost \"a few minutes off the bike,\" showing the distance has teeth for managing power output."
  },
  "technicality": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Course includes \"a bit of single track near the end\" technical enough to cause sidewall slashes that won't plug. Evan McGregor noted descending \"used to be a liability\" before skills training, but after BaseCamp camp he was \"ripping along\" the technical descents, indicating meaningful technical challenge."
  },
  "elevation": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "4000 feet over 50 miles creates sustained climbing pressure, with Big Pond Hollow serving as a particular cramp-inducing section. Three distance options range from 2,718 feet (short) to 7,211 feet (full), showing the terrain delivers consistent vertical across all route lengths."
  },
  "climate": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "September 2025 and June 2026 dates put you in Pennsylvania's variable weather window — could be perfect 70s or swampy 90s with humidity. The organizational instability between years suggests they're still figuring out optimal timing for conditions. Central PA's notorious for surprise weather swings, and no historical weather incident data means you're gambling on Mother Nature's mood."
  },
  "altitude": {
    "score": 1,
    "explanation": "Central Pennsylvania elevation presents zero altitude considerations. The climbing difficulty comes from sustained grades and technical terrain, not thin air — Big Pond Hollow cramped an elite rider through power demand, not oxygen debt."
  },
  "adventure": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Michaux State Forest provides forest roads and singletrack through established terrain rather than remote wilderness. The Hamilton family chose this as their \"first gravel bike race\" Father's Day gift, suggesting accessible adventure rather than epic backcountry exploration."
  },
  "prestige": {
    "score": 1,
    "explanation": "This is the 3rd annual edition of a race so new it can't even keep its name straight — Michaux GRVL in 2025, Camp Michaux Gravel Grinder in 2026, different organizers each year. No notable past winners documented, no YouTube coverage, zero professional field mention. Trans-Sylvania Productions might salvage some credibility for 2026, but right now you're basically paying to beta-test someone's event concept."
  },
  "race_quality": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Two aid stations, SAG support, and cutoff times (11:30 AM, 1:00 PM, 3:00 PM) provide basic race infrastructure. 57 finishers in 2024 Half Course ranging from 3:09:45 to 5:54:19 shows proper timing systems, though organizational handoffs between years suggest inconsistent execution standards."
  },
  "experience": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Starting at Caledonia State Park in 2025 then moving to Birch Run Road in Biglerville for 2026 — they can't even nail down a consistent venue. Pre-race packet pickup at Michaux Brewing Co is a nice touch, but the constant organizational changes suggest an event still figuring out its identity. The 'Fast may go Fast & the Slow may go Slow' marketing speaks to recreational inclusivity, not memorable racing moments."
  },
  "community": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Franklin County Cyclists organizing one year, Trans-Sylvania Productions the next — this isn't community building, it's organizational musical chairs. No documented rider reviews, Reddit discussions, or community perception data means either nobody's talking about it or nobody cares enough to talk. Two years in and still switching venues suggests they haven't found their tribe yet."
  },
  "field_depth": {
    "score": 1,
    "explanation": "No field size data, no notable past winners, no professional rider participation documented. The explicit focus on recreational pace options and 'personal statistics' timing suggests this attracts weekend warriors, not serious competitive depth. Prize structure for 'top 3 in each category when 3+ riders exist' basically tells you they're hoping to scrape together podiums."
  },
  "value": {
    "score": 4,
    "explanation": "Multiple route options including a new 100-mile expert route, two aid stations, mechanic support, SAG coverage, food truck with beer service, and timing for personal stats — solid package for what's likely modest entry fees. Pre-race packet pickup at a local brewery adds local flavor without premium pricing. You're getting event infrastructure without paying established-race premiums."
  },
  "expenses": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Central Pennsylvania location keeps lodging reasonable, Caledonia State Park and Biglerville venues aren't resort destinations demanding premium accommodation costs. No entry fee data available but the infrastructure level suggests mid-range pricing. Packet pickup at Waynesboro's Michaux Brewing Co indicates they're working with local businesses, not gouging visitors with overpriced partnerships."
