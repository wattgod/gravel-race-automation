  "logistics": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The Carpathian Gravel Grinder Weekend operates through Carpatbike.ro with multi-day tour structure, but specific race-day logistics remain unclear. Routes connect villages like Pestera, Magura, Fundata, and Podu Dambovitei across national park territory where infrastructure is minimal."
  },
  "length": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Sixty-five miles hits the gravel sweet spot—long enough to hurt, short enough to survive if the support is sketchy. It's not an epic like the 1900km Carpathian Mountain Race bikepacking suffer-fest, but substantial enough to test your mountain legs properly."
  },
  "technicality": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The route mixes \"60% forest and off road paths, 30% quiet roads, 10% shared traffic\" through \"cart roads, single tracks, country lanes.\" Riders describe \"forests, rivers, khashi and mud\" with terrain \"suitable for gravel but also mountain bikes, depending on your riding style.\""
  },
  "elevation": {
    "score": 4,
    "explanation": "5500 feet of climbing through \"the hilly area between Piatra Craiului National Park and Bucegi National Park\" delivers sustained mountain punishment. The route crosses alpine meadows and connects villages like Sohodol, Fundata, and Dambovicioara with serious vertical between national park ranges."
  },
  "climate": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Romanian mountain weather swings unpredictably—the January Carpathian rally mentions icy forest roads on Comandaü plateau. Summer timing helps, but crossing between Piatra Craiului and Bucegi ranges through \"alpine meadows\" means temperature variation and potential weather drama."
  },
  "altitude": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Carpathian peaks stay under serious altitude thresholds through villages like Fundata and Fundatica—no oxygen debt drama here. The elevation effects come from sustained climbing through \"orchards, hamlets and valleys\" rather than thin air. Sea-level lungs work fine in Romanian mountains."
  },
  "adventure": {
    "score": 4,
    "explanation": "The Carpathian Mountains deliver wilderness adventure whether the race organization shows up or not. You're riding through territory that produces 1900km unsupported bikepacking epics—the landscape doesn't care about your logistics preferences. Raw mountain terrain guarantees memorable suffering."
  },
  "prestige": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The Carpathian Gravel Grinder Weekend promotes \"three days of relaxation, fun, and adventure\" rather than competitive prestige. It's positioned as touring experience through Bran area with stops \"to have a drink on the terrace of local rural pubs\" rather than serious racing credentials."
  },
  "race_quality": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Organized as multi-day tour through Carpatbike.ro with \"Serenity meets adventure\" focus rather than race infrastructure. The experience includes sightseeing stops \"to admire open landscape, views of Bran Castle\" suggesting guided tour rather than timed competitive event."
  },
  "experience": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The route delivers \"adventure, excitement, pedaling through peaceful landscape\" across Piatra Craiului and Bucegi territory. Riders experience \"forests, rivers, khashi and mud\" while passing through villages like Sirnea, Pestera, and Magura with cultural stops at local rural establishments."
  },
  "community": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Promoted as opportunity \"to join fellow enthusiasts like yourself\" with small group touring atmosphere. The @battistrada and @littlebigcycling8638 endorsement suggests niche following, but limited race reports indicate small, adventure-focused community rather than broad gravel racing participation."
  },
  "field_depth": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Tour format accommodates \"XC bicycles, Ebikes and gravel bikes\" suggesting mixed-ability participants rather than competitive field. The multi-day adventure structure with sightseeing stops attracts touring cyclists and adventure seekers more than serious racers seeking fast competition."
  },
  "value": {
    "score": 4,
    "explanation": "Romania delivers serious mountain adventure through Bucegi and Piatra Craiului National Parks at developing-nation costs. The route covers \"cart roads, single tracks, country lanes\" through authentic terrain with cultural experiences like Bran Castle views without Western European price inflation."
  },
  "expenses": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Reaching Romanian mountain venues requires flights to Bucharest plus ground transport to villages like Zarnesti and Fundata. Carpatbike.ro offers \"XC bicycles, Ebikes and gravel bikes\" rental, but total trip costs accumulate with remote location logistics and multi-day accommodation needs."
