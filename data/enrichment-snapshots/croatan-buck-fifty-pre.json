  "prestige": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "This is a regional North Carolina event that barely registers outside the Southeast gravel scene. No pro field depth, no major media coverage, and the fact that basic race data like prize purse and field size aren't even documented tells you everything about its national relevance. It's a solid local suffer-fest but won't impress anyone at Unbound."
  },
  "race_quality": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Starting at Carteret Speedway gives it some character, and the lap-based format through Croatan National Forest is well-organized with Black Swamp Aid Station at mile 23. The staggered start times (7:30am for Buck Fifty, 8:30am for Buck, 9:30am for shorter distances) show thoughtful race management. But without more detailed course information or rider feedback, it's hard to call this exceptional."
  },
  "experience": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Three laps of 46.4 miles each through coastal North Carolina forest offers decent variety, and requiring lights for final lap departures after 2pm adds some drama. The speedway start/finish and Food Truck Rodeo create a festival atmosphere. But the low elevation and coastal terrain won't deliver the epic mountain sufferfest that defines memorable gravel experiences."
  },
  "community": {
    "score": 4,
    "explanation": "The Food Truck Rodeo from 12-7pm and optional pre-race meeting show real effort to build community around the event. Multiple distance options (20, 46, 93, and 139 miles) bring different skill levels together at the same venue. Age categories for The Fifty and pit setup at the speedway create a welcoming but competitive environment that keeps people coming back."
  },
  "field_depth": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "With four distance options including a 20-mile entry point, you get a decent spread of abilities showing up to Carteret Speedway. Age categories for The Fifty suggest a mature field, but there's zero evidence of elite-level competition or sponsored teams. It's solid regional depth without the firepower that makes you question your life choices."
  },
  "value": {
    "score": 4,
    "explanation": "Getting 139.2 miles of racing through Croatan National Forest with aid stations, timing, and a speedway venue delivers solid bang for your buck. The Food Truck Rodeo and festival atmosphere add value beyond just the race itself. Without knowing exact entry fees, the organized logistics and multiple distance options suggest fair pricing for what you're getting."
  },
  "expenses": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Swansboro/New Bern area keeps costs reasonable compared to destination races, though you'll still need overnight lodging for most riders. Packet pickup both day-before and race morning gives flexibility, and the speedway location should have decent parking. No major airport nearby means driving for most, but that's typical for Southeast gravel events."
  },
  "length": {
    "score": 5,
    "explanation": "At 139.2 miles, the Buck Fifty delivers legitimate ultra-distance suffering that separates pretenders from contenders. Three full laps of 46.4 miles each means you'll know every bump and turn by the end, which creates its own psychological warfare. This is proper long-distance gravel racing, not some 70-mile weekend warrior ride masquerading as an epic."
  },
  "technicality": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Croatan National Forest terrain in coastal North Carolina isn't exactly known for gnarly technical challenges. The neutral escort to gravel and lap-based format suggest mostly fire roads and smoother surfaces rather than rock gardens or sketchy descents. This is about endurance and pacing, not bike handling skills."
  },
  "elevation": {
    "score": 1,
    "explanation": "5000 feet over 139 miles in coastal North Carolina forest means you're basically riding a pancake. That's roughly 36 feet of climbing per mile, which is flatter than most century rides. If you're looking for leg-breaking climbs or mountain sufferfest, this ain't it."
  },
  "climate": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "March in coastal North Carolina usually delivers mild temperatures and manageable conditions, though spring weather can be unpredictable. The early season timing avoids summer heat and humidity that makes the Southeast miserable. But coastal location means potential for wind, and you might catch a cold front or rain that turns the day ugly."
  },
  "altitude": {
    "score": 1,
    "explanation": "Starting near sea level in coastal North Carolina means altitude isn't even a consideration. You'll breathe easy the entire 139 miles, which is great for performance but offers zero high-altitude training benefit. This is pure sea-level grinding."
  },
  "logistics": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Carteret Speedway provides solid infrastructure with 6am opening, infield parking, and proper timing setup. Two packet pickup windows and clear start time procedures show competent race management. But limited nearby airport access and unclear lodging options around Swansboro keep this from being truly convenient for out-of-state riders."
  },
  "adventure": {
    "score": 4,
    "explanation": "Three laps through Croatan National Forest offers genuine backcountry exploration, and requiring lights for late finishers adds real adventure elements. The speedway-to-forest transition and potential for night riding on the final lap create memorable moments. It's not Himalayan epic, but 139 miles of North Carolina wilderness delivers proper adventure for most riders."
