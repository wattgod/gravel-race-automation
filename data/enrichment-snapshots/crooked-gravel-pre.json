    "explanation": "Strambecco calls it one of Colorado's best gravel events, but that's marketing fluff when nobody can name a single notable winner or find race coverage anywhere. Cash prizes exist but amounts are mysteriously absent from all materials. It's a regional event trying to punch above its weight class without the field depth or media attention to back it up."

    "explanation": "The Ride Collective and Gemini Adventures put on a competent operation with Friday packet pickup at Terrain Taco and pre-ride options. Mass start at 8:00 AM with police escort down Main Street shows they understand race flow. But one aid station for the 25-mile course and zero details about the 67-mile support structure suggests bare-minimum execution."

  "experience": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Starting at Winter Park Resort at 8,700 feet through aspen groves and wildflowers delivers legitimate high-alpine beauty. The meandering ascents and exhilarating descents through Grand County's gravel network provide solid riding. But without specific course details, technical features, or rider testimonials, it's impossible to know if this transcends basic mountain scenery."

  "community": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Weekend lodging recommendations at Winter Park Mountain Lodge and post-race dining at Boca Winter Park or Prato suggest people stick around. The Rendezvous Event Center provides family-friendly facilities with playground and shade for spectators. However, zero rider quotes, forum discussions, or community testimonials means this could be surface-level friendliness without real depth."
  },
  "field_depth": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "No field size data, no notable past winners, and e-bikes mixing with the 25-mile recreational category tells you everything about competitive depth. Cash prizes exist but when organizers won't publish amounts or highlight elite participation, you're looking at a participation trophy field. Regional riders showing up for mountain air, not podium battles."
  },
  "value": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Entry fees are completely absent from all race materials, making value impossible to assess properly. You get high-alpine terrain starting at 8,700 feet with nearly 2,000 feet of climbing on even the short course. Without knowing if this costs $75 or $175, it's a blind gamble on whether the Grand County gravel experience justifies the price tag."
  },
  "expenses": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Winter Park resort town pricing hits hard with recommended lodging at Winter Park Mountain Lodge and dining at Bosphorous Turkish Cuisine. No nearby airport data provided, but you're looking at Denver International plus a 90-minute mountain drive minimum. Campgrounds like Idlewild offer budget relief, but August peak season means premium rates across the board."
  },
  "length": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "67-mile main course hits the sweet spot for gravel racing distance, though research shows conflicting 62-mile vs 67-mile measurements. The 25-mile option climbing nearly 2,000 feet from 8,700 feet provides legitimate challenge for recreational riders. Two distance choices accommodate different skill levels without diluting the main event."
  },
  "technicality": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "High alpine gravel through aspen and pine forests with smooth gravel roads suggests moderate technical demands rather than chunk-fest punishment. The 25-mile course is described as challenging even for the 'mini' distance, but without surface breakdowns or specific technical features, this reads like standard mountain gravel rather than skills-testing terrain."
  },
  "elevation": {
    "score": 4,
    "explanation": "Starting at Winter Park Resort at 8,700 feet with the short course climbing nearly 2,000 feet delivers legitimate vertical punishment. High alpine terrain throughout the 67-mile course means sustained climbing through Grand County's mountain gravel network. This elevation profile will separate pretenders from contenders, especially combined with thin air effects."
  },
  "climate": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "August in Winter Park averages 71°F high and 38°F low, creating perfect gravel conditions when cooperation happens. But weather is described as extremely unpredictable at 8,700+ feet elevation. Morning starts could hit near freezing while afternoon sun bakes exposed climbs - pack layers or suffer the consequences of mountain weather naivety."
  },
  "altitude": {
    "score": 4,
    "explanation": "Starting at 8,700 feet at Winter Park Resort puts you immediately in oxygen debt territory. High alpine course routing through Grand County means sustained time above 8,500 feet where sea-level lungs turn to concrete. Flatlanders will discover their FTP means nothing when the air contains half the oxygen they're used to breathing."
  },
  "logistics": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Rendezvous Event Center at Hideaway Park provides solid race headquarters with restrooms and parking at 78841 US-40. Friday packet pickup at Terrain Taco plus Saturday morning registration offers flexibility. However, missing crucial details like nearest airport, specific parking capacity, and aid station locations beyond 'one station' for the short course suggests incomplete planning communication."
  },
  "adventure": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "High alpine gravel through hundreds of miles of Grand County's backcountry roads delivers legitimate wilderness exposure. Aspen groves, babbling brooks, and sustained climbing above 8,700 feet provide mountain adventure credentials. But without specific route details, technical challenges, or remote sections described, this could be adventure-flavored tourism rather than genuine backcountry exploration."
