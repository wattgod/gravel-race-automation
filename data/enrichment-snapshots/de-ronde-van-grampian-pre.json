    "explanation": "This is a local Michigan Gravel Race Series event that barely registers outside Oakland County. No prize purse, no pro field worth mentioning, and results showing Mark Eelnurme and Kim Mapes as your 2024 standouts tells you everything about the competition level. It's a tribute race with roots in other forgotten local events, not a destination race anyone's bragging about."

  "race_quality": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Epic Timing handles the logistics professionally and the 99% gravel surface is legit, but this is basic small-town race execution. On-site mechanical support from KLM Bike & Fitness and Red Shed Cycles shows they care about rider support. The private Upland Hills access adds a unique element, but with no detailed aid station info or cutoff times published, it feels more like organized group ride than serious competition."

  "experience": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The exclusive access to Upland Hills private land that you can't pre-ride is genuinely cool - no trespassing allowed means race day surprises on sandy, hilly terrain. Hitting Oakland County's highest point at 1,250ft on Drahner Road gives you bragging rights for about five minutes. Post-race free beer while supplies last and a Dutch windmill sighting won't save you from the reality that 50 miles and 2,942ft of gain is a Tuesday ride with timing chips."
  },
  "community": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Solid Michigan Gravel Race Series event that brings together the local scene without pretense. Two bike shops providing mechanical support shows real community investment, not just race-day opportunism. The tribute nature to previous local races (Ronde van Stony, Grampian Challenge) means this has actual roots, not manufactured tradition."
  },
  "field_depth": {
    "score": 1,
    "explanation": "Looking at 2024 results with winners like Mark Eelnurme at 37:17 tells you this isn't attracting serious talent. Age group splits show decent participation but nothing suggesting competitive depth beyond recreational riders. No prize money means the fast guys are racing somewhere else that weekend."
  },
  "value": {
    "score": 4,
    "explanation": "You get 99% gravel roads, exclusive access to private Upland Hills terrain, timing, mechanical support, post-race food options and free beer for what's likely reasonable Michigan pricing. Three distance options from 12 to 50 miles with legitimate elevation gain means everyone from beginners to weekend warriors gets their money's worth. The private land access alone makes this worth the entry fee."
  },
  "expenses": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Oxford, Michigan isn't going to break your budget on lodging or food, and you're probably driving here unless you live in Detroit. No airport or accommodation strategy needed means you're looking at gas money and a cheap motel if you're not local. Registration closes July 30th but this isn't selling out in minutes, so no premium panic pricing."
  },
  "length": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The 50-mile flagship distance is respectable weekend warrior territory but nothing that'll test your endurance limits. At 2,942ft of gain over 50 miles, you're looking at rolling terrain that's more about consistency than survival. The 25-mile option at 1,585ft and 12-mile at 742ft show this is built for participation, not suffering."
  },
  "technicality": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The mix of gravel roads, old-school singletrack at Bald Mountain, and rough two-track keeps you honest but won't break your bike. Sandy, hilly Upland Hills private sections add legitimate technical challenge since you can't pre-ride them. 99% gravel means no pavement bail-outs, but this is Michigan rolling terrain, not mountain bike park difficulty."
  },
  "elevation": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Nearly 3,000 feet over 50 miles creates steady work without any brutal singular climbs. Drahner Road tops out at Oakland County's highest point of 1,250ft, which sounds impressive until you realize that's Michigan's idea of a mountain. The endless rollers through Oakland and Lapeer counties will wear on you, but this isn't climbing, it's grinding."
  },
  "climate": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Early August in Michigan means potential heat and humidity that'll sap you on those rolling climbs. No historical weather incidents mentioned, which likely means it's been consistently mediocre rather than memorably brutal. At least you're not dealing with spring mud or fall freeze, but summer in the Midwest isn't exactly gravel paradise either."
  },
  "altitude": {
    "score": 1,
    "explanation": "Starting near sea level and topping out at 1,250ft on Drahner Road means altitude is completely irrelevant. This is Michigan flat with some bumps, not mountain training. Your biggest altitude concern is whether your Garmin bothers recording elevation changes this small."
  },
  "logistics": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Single venue at Upland Hills Farm keeps things simple with packet pickup from 7-8:30 AM and everything centralized at 481 Lake George Rd. Epic Timing provides professional race management and GPX files are available for course prep. The no-trespassing policy on private sections shows they take land access seriously, which matters for future editions."
  },
  "adventure": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The private Upland Hills terrain you can't scout beforehand creates genuine race-day discovery, and hitting Oakland County's high point has local significance. Singletrack at Bald Mountain and views along Lake George beat pure road grinding. But ultimately you're riding Michigan gravel roads, not exploring uncharted territory - it's adventure with training wheels."
