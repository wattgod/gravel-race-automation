  "prestige": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Eleven years in and still no podiums, no trophies, just bragging rights — that's not building prestige, that's avoiding it. The 700-rider sellout proves local loyalty, but you won't find pros lining up for red clay roads in Monticello. It's a charity ride for 4-H programs, which is noble but doesn't move needles in the gravel scene."
  },
  "race_quality": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "When your contingency plan is four different paved routes because wet dirt becomes 'very difficult,' you're admitting the main course is unreliable. No aid station details, no cutoff times, no timing infrastructure — this reads like an organized group ride with entry fees. The 75% gravel promise disappears the moment weather turns."
  },
  "experience": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Oak canopies and pecan orchards through grand southern plantations deliver genuine scenery most gravel races can't touch. The red clay and dirt roads are legitimately unique — you won't find this terrain in Colorado or Vermont. But unpredictable conditions mean you might end up on pavement wondering why you didn't just ride from home."
  },
  "community": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Event director Betsy Barfield and her wingman have built something that sells out 700 spots annually while donating all proceeds to 4-H programs. Small-town Monticello hospitality is real, and the 'celebration of gorgeous landscapes' vibe attracts riders who get it. Not a hammerfest, just people who want to suffer together on red dirt."
  },
  "field_depth": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "No podiums, no prize purse, no competitive structure — you're not racing against serious fields here. This attracts charity riders, adventure tourists, and early-season fitness testers, not the deep benches that make racing interesting. The 700-rider cap keeps it manageable but doesn't filter for talent."
  },
  "value": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "All proceeds go to 4-H programs, so your entry fee funds actual community benefit rather than race promoter profits. Four distance options (34, 55, 72, 94 miles) give flexibility most races don't offer. Entry cost isn't listed but small-town Florida economics suggest reasonable pricing for what amounts to a guided tour with snacks."
  },
  "expenses": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Accommodation in Monticello sold out last year, forcing riders into longer drives or pricier options. Small-town Florida means limited lodging and dining choices, driving up costs through scarcity. No airport info suggests you're driving or flying into Tallahassee then dealing with ground transport to nowhere."
  },
  "length": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The 65-mile main distance hits the sweet spot for most riders — long enough to matter, short enough to finish without drama. Four route options from 34 to 94 miles let you match ambition to fitness. March timing makes it a perfect early-season fitness test without the commitment of century+ sufferfests."
  },
  "technicality": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Red dirt and clay roads through rolling farmland aren't technically demanding — just unpredictable when wet. No named climbs or technical sectors mentioned, suggesting straightforward rural roads with variable surfaces. The main challenge is traction and weather, not bike handling skills."
  },
  "elevation": {
    "score": 1,
    "explanation": "800 feet over 65 miles in North Florida is pancake-flat by any serious standard. The 'rolling countryside' description can't hide the reality of minimal vertical challenge. If you're looking for climbing, this isn't your race — save the money and ride local hills instead."
  },
  "climate": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "March in North Florida delivers 'fairly dry' and 'warm weather' perfect for early-season riding when most places are still frozen. You'll hit full sun blasts between oak canopy sections, but nothing like summer Florida heat. The only weather risk is rain turning dirt roads into slop — hence all those paved backup routes."
  },
  "altitude": {
    "score": 1,
    "explanation": "Monticello, Florida sits barely above sea level with zero altitude considerations. No acclimatization needed, no breathing challenges, no mountain drama — just flat coastal plain riding. If altitude matters to your training, look elsewhere."
  },
  "logistics": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The race provides GPS downloads for both gravel and paved backup routes, showing they've learned from weather disasters. 700-rider cap keeps logistics manageable compared to mega-events. However, no packet pickup details and accommodation sellouts suggest planning beyond route marking needs work."
  },
  "adventure": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Unique red clay terrain through genuine southern plantation country offers scenery you won't find elsewhere in gravel. But when your adventure depends entirely on weather cooperation, it's not really adventure — it's hope. The backup paved routes admit the main course can't handle conditions, limiting genuine exploration."
