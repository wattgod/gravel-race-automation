    "explanation": "A $3,000 prize purse split between men and women tells you everything about where this sits in the gravel hierarchy. Custom hand-made trophies from Grouchy Old Main Studios sound charming until you realize they require minimum 5 pre-registered riders per category to even exist. This is regional racing trying to dress up as something bigger."
  },
  "race_quality": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "When your preliminary routes aren't final by July for an October race, that's not attention to detail. Field caps bounce between 200 and 600 riders depending on which listing you believe, suggesting organizational confusion. The staggered starts 15 minutes apart for 100-mile men versus women shows they're thinking about timing, but execution remains unproven."

  "experience": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Packet pickup at S&S Fire Pits with beverages, fire, and s'mores is genuinely thoughtful community building. Multiple distance options from 20 to 102 miles means you can find your suffering level. The Thursday night pre-race gathering near Hartsfield-Jackson creates actual connection before you scatter across Georgia gravel."
  },
  "community": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The fire pit packet pickup isn't marketing theater—it's real community investment. First-come, first-served registration and hand-made trophies suggest organizers who care more about riders than revenue optimization. When race directors choose s'mores over corporate sponsors, that usually translates to better rider experience."
  },
  "field_depth": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "200-600 rider field caps suggest regional draw, not national talent migration. The prize money split indicates they're trying to attract faster riders, but Georgia gravel doesn't pull the depth of Colorado or Kansas events. You'll race against solid regional competition, not the traveling circus of gravel mercenaries."
  },
  "value": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Registration starts at $70 through August, hitting $125 day-of—reasonable for what you're getting. The packet pickup party, custom trophies, and multiple distance options deliver solid bang for buck. No price gouging, no mandatory overpriced swag packages."

  "expenses": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Chattahoochee Hills sits close enough to Atlanta that you're not looking at resort town lodging prices. Packet pickup near Hartsfield-Jackson means easy airport access without rental car drama. Georgia in October won't break your budget on gear or travel logistics."
  },
  "length": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "75 miles hits the gravel sweet spot—long enough to hurt, short enough to recover by Monday. The 102-mile option exists for masochists, while 62 and 20-mile distances let mortals participate. Smart distance staging that acknowledges not everyone needs to suffer equally."
  },
  "technicality": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Georgia gravel typically means fire roads and rolling terrain, not rock garden technical sections. The research shows no mention of named climbs or technical features, suggesting this leans more endurance than skills challenge. You'll need fitness more than bike handling wizardry."
  },
  "elevation": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "3,000 feet over 75 miles averages 40 feet per mile—rolling but not punishing. Georgia's piedmont region delivers consistent ups and downs rather than categorized climbs. Enough to make your legs remember the day, not enough to create suffering legends."
  },
  "climate": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "October in Georgia can range from pleasant fall mornings to humid summer flashbacks. You're gambling on weather that could be perfect or swamp-like, with no mountain elevation to guarantee cooler temperatures. Pack for variability, hope for luck."
  },
  "altitude": {
    "score": 1,
    "explanation": "Chattahoochee Hills sits barely above sea level in gravel terms. Zero altitude consideration needed for preparation or performance. If you're coming from elevation, expect to feel stronger; if you're from sea level, this changes nothing."
  },
  "logistics": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Packet pickup near Hartsfield-Jackson airport is genuinely convenient for travelers. 45-minute early arrival requirement suggests organized staging, not chaotic scrambling. Multiple distance options with staggered starts shows they've thought through traffic flow."
  },
  "adventure": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Georgia gravel through Chattahoochee Hills offers pleasant countryside, not epic wilderness immersion. You're riding through farmland and forest, not discovering hidden canyons or remote mountain passes. Solid regional adventure, but don't expect stories that last decades."
