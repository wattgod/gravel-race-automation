    "explanation": "Here's the brutal truth: I can't even confirm this race exists under this name. The research turns up The UNDEAD Death Ride and Flint Hills Gravel Ride, but no 'Flint Hills Death Ride' in Cottonwood Falls. When your event is so underground that Google can't find it, you're either running a ghost race or operating in complete obscurity."
  },
  "race_quality": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Can't rate what I can't find. The similar Kansas gravel events like Flint Hills Gravel Ride in Americus show proper organization with Red Dirt Race Management timing and multiple distance options. But this mysterious Cottonwood Falls version? Zero evidence of professional timing, aid stations, or basic race infrastructure."
  },
  "experience": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The Flint Hills region delivers legitimate gravel adventure - rolling prairie, endless horizon, proper Kansas wind. Even if this specific race is a phantom, the terrain around Cottonwood Falls sits in prime Flint Hills country. You'll get authentic prairie suffering and that stark beauty that makes Kansas gravel worth the drive."
  },
  "community": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Kansas gravel riders are hardcore by necessity - they have to be to survive the wind and isolation. The broader Flint Hills scene shows up for events like the confirmed races in Americus and Madison. Small-town Kansas cycling communities stick together, even if this particular event flies under the radar."
  },
  "field_depth": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Hard to attract serious competition when riders can't find your registration page. The established Kansas gravel races pull decent fields, but this ghost event likely draws locals and the occasional lost soul. Without confirmed race results or coverage, you're looking at participation trophy depth."
  },
  "value": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "65 miles through the Flint Hills for probably cheap entry - assuming you can figure out how to register. Kansas events typically run budget-friendly compared to Colorado or California circus shows. The scenery and suffering come free with the wind."
  },
  "expenses": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Cottonwood Falls isn't exactly a tourist trap - lodging and food stay reasonable in rural Kansas. Gas to get there might hurt more than the race entry. No fancy expo or overpriced vendor village to drain your wallet."
  },
  "length": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "65 miles hits the sweet spot - long enough to hurt, short enough to finish before the Kansas wind breaks your soul completely. Solid gravel distance that separates weekend warriors from actual riders without requiring overnight camping."
  },
  "technicality": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Flint Hills terrain runs more about endurance than technical skill. You're fighting wind, distance, and rolling hills - not rock gardens or creek crossings. The challenge comes from relentless prairie exposure, not bike handling wizardry."
  },
  "elevation": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "4500 feet over 65 miles through the Flint Hills creates honest work. Not mountain suffering, but those rolling prairie hills add up when the wind hits you sideways. Enough climbing to earn your finish without requiring a sherpa."
  },
  "climate": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Kansas weather gambles with your life. Spring brings tornadoes, summer delivers furnace heat, and the wind never stops. The research mentions 'cool temperatures' for other Flint Hills events, but Kansas can flip from pleasant to apocalyptic in thirty minutes."
  },
  "altitude": {
    "score": 1,
    "explanation": "Cottonwood Falls sits around 1,200 feet above sea level. Your sea-level lungs won't notice the difference. The only breathing problems come from swallowing Kansas dust and cursing the endless headwind."
  },
  "logistics": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Small-town Kansas logistics mean basic amenities and hoping someone remembered to bring the timing equipment. Other regional events like Flint Hills Gravel Ride show proper organization, but this phantom race offers zero evidence of professional logistics or support infrastructure."
  },
  "adventure": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Riding mystery races through Kansas prairie qualifies as adventure by default. The Flint Hills deliver legitimate big-sky isolation and that peculiar beauty of endless grassland. Whether the actual event exists or you're just riding gravel roads around Cottonwood Falls, you'll get your prairie adventure."
