    "score": 1,
    "explanation": "Part of the BC Gravel Series but nobody's putting this on their bucket list. It's a rider-favorite in Canada, but that's like being the tallest person in a kindergarten class. The 2025 race got postponed after a 'risk assessment' — not exactly the kind of thing that builds legend status."
  },
  "race_quality": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Jon Watkin runs a competent operation with three distance options and full aid station support. But the 2025 postponement suggests organizational hiccups, and the fact that basic details like surface breakdown and weather patterns aren't readily available points to a race still finding its footing. It's functional, not exceptional."
  },
  "experience": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "You get the Puntledge River route and a climb up Forbidden Plateau Road, which sounds decent on paper. But this feels more like a nice weekend ride with timing chips than a transformative gravel experience. The Vancouver Island setting has potential, but execution seems to lag behind the scenery."
  },
  "community": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "It's described as a 'rider-favorite' returning to the BC Gravel Series, but that's promoter speak for 'people showed up last time.' The community exists but lacks the depth and passion you see at races with real followings. Hosted by Mosaic Forest Management — corporate backing without the grassroots soul."
  },
  "field_depth": {
    "score": 1,
    "explanation": "No mention of notable winners, pros, or competitive depth anywhere in the research. When a gravel race can't name a single standout performer or doesn't attract talent worth mentioning, you're looking at a participation trophy field. The BC Gravel Series circuit isn't exactly drawing international firepower."
  },
  "value": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Three distance options with full support and complimentary food gives you options and sustenance without gouging. No entry fee data available, but being part of a regional series suggests reasonable pricing. You're getting a supported ride on Vancouver Island — not life-changing, but fair for what it delivers."
  },
  "expenses": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Cumberland, BC isn't exactly a budget destination, and Vancouver Island logistics mean ferry costs or flights. No clear lodging strategy or airport details available, which suggests you'll be figuring out expensive travel arrangements on your own. The race might be reasonably priced, but getting there won't be."
  },
  "length": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "55 miles sits in gravel purgatory — too short to be epic, too long to be a quick hit. The Intermedio option at ~75km (47 miles) and Esperto at ~110km (68 miles) give you choices, but none push into the suffer-fest territory that builds character. It's weekend warrior distance, not legend-making length."
  },
  "technicality": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The BC Gravel Series promises 'rugged terrain and unpredictable conditions' that test mental fortitude, and the Forbidden Plateau Road climb suggests legitimate technical challenge. Vancouver Island's terrain has teeth when it wants to. Without surface breakdown details, you're gambling, but the name 'Forbidden' wasn't chosen for marketing fluff."
  },
  "elevation": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "4000 feet over 55 miles means real climbing without being ridiculous — about 73 feet per mile. The Forbidden Plateau Road climb is likely where you'll earn your finisher's medal. It's legitimate elevation that'll test your gearing choices without requiring oxygen masks."
  },
  "climate": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "September on Vancouver Island is weather roulette — could be perfect, could be a soggy mess. The 2025 postponement after 'risk assessment' suggests Mother Nature doesn't always cooperate. Without historical weather data or rider reports, you're rolling dice on conditions that clearly concern the organizers enough to call off races."
  },
  "altitude": {
    "score": 1,
    "explanation": "Vancouver Island starts at sea level, and even climbing Forbidden Plateau Road won't get you high enough to matter physiologically. You might hit 2000-3000 feet at the peak, which is nothing. Your biggest breathing challenge will be the gradients, not thin air."
  },
  "logistics": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Cumberland is a small town that's not exactly built for event logistics, and the research shows zero details on parking, packet pickup, or travel strategy. Being on Vancouver Island adds ferry complexity or flight costs. The race has basic organization with aid stations, but the infrastructure around it feels underdeveloped."
  },
  "adventure": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Riding gravel roads named after forbidden plateaus on a remote Canadian island has legitimate adventure appeal. The expanded route along Puntledge River and climb up terrain rugged enough to postpone races suggests you'll earn some stories. It's not Patagonia, but it's real wilderness riding without the safety net of civilization every few miles."
