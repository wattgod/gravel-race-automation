  "logistics": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Registration through BikeReg.com is standard and functional. The research lacks specifics on parking and packet pickup, but Iowa races typically handle basics competently. Nothing groundbreaking, nothing broken."
  },
  "length": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "100k hits the sweet spot for most gravel riders - long enough to hurt, short enough to not require expedition planning. It's a proper distance that demands respect without turning into an endurance death march."
  },
  "technicality": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Course features freshly graded dirt roads and is described as \"moderate terrain with rolling short steep hills or moderate, sustained climbs.\" This is Iowa farmland that tests fitness more than bike handling skills."
  },
  "elevation": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "2,400 feet over 62 miles averages about 39 feet per mile through rolling short steep hills and moderate sustained climbs. Iowa's terrain provides steady work without punch-you-in-the-face climbs."
  },
  "climate": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "August in Iowa brings heat and humidity that can wreck unprepared riders. 2020 conditions were ideal at 67 degrees with 17 mph wind, but that's not typical. 7:30 AM start helps beat the worst heat."
  },
  "altitude": {
    "score": 1,
    "explanation": "Iowa sits barely above sea level. Zero altitude considerations, zero acclimatization needed. Your sea-level fitness transfers directly without any thin-air complications."
  },
  "adventure": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The 2025 edition marketed itself as \"rethinking what a gravel race might be if you decided to race around your own home\" with promised \"surprise\" features. Pastoral Iowa scenery but not epic adventure racing territory."
  },
  "prestige": {
    "score": 1,
    "explanation": "Described as \"the one that started it all\" for the Iowa Gravel Series, giving it foundational status regionally. Lucas Barloon won in 2:41:34 in 2020, but it's not drawing national talent or media attention."
  },
  "race_quality": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Provides chip timing, marked course, aid stations, pro photography, and medical support. As the founding race of the Iowa Gravel Series, it aims to \"make this a great day in the saddle for everyone.\""
  },
  "experience": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Event photography is included and they promise medical support with aid station snacks. 62 miles with 2,400 feet of climbing won't blow your mind, but it won't bore you either. Solidly unremarkable but functional."
  },
  "community": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Strong team participation visible in results including Team Struggle Bus, Team Rocket, and Cycling Sloths with creative names like \"Perineum Punishers.\" Part of a seven-race Iowa series that builds season-long engagement beyond weekend warriors."
  },
  "field_depth": {
    "score": 1,
    "explanation": "2020 results show times ranging from Lucas Barloon's 2:41:34 win to 7:26+ for back-of-pack finishers with median around 4 hours. Regional Iowa racing in August isn't drawing national competitive depth."
  },
  "value": {
    "score": 4,
    "explanation": "Single race entry starts at $40 early registration, which is reasonable for chip timing and aid station support. The $399 full season pass for seven races plus meals and gear is good math. Hard to complain about Iowa pricing."
  },
  "expenses": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Glenwood, Iowa won't bankrupt you on lodging or dining compared to destination races. Late registration bumps to $50-70 depending on package, but that's standard race tax for procrastination."
