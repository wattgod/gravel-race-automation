    "explanation": "UCI Oceania Tour 1.2 status since 2018 gives it legitimate international recognition, drawing teams from Sweden, Japan, US, and Australia for early season UCI points. Brodie Chapman's podium declaration that it was 'the most fun I've had on a bike – ever!' carries weight from a WorldTour rider. But let's be honest – it's still a regional New Zealand race that postponed its 2025 edition entirely, which doesn't scream bulletproof prestige."

    "explanation": "The peloton fractures from punctures and crashes on gravel sectors, with many riders missing time cuts or DNFing outright – that's the mark of a legitimate race, not some charity ride. Called 'one of the toughest one-day cycling events in Oceania' with good reason. The 5-6 gravel sectors through Pohangina watersheds separate pretenders from contenders, though the 75% sealed road ratio keeps it from being pure gravel carnage."

    "score": 4,
    "explanation": "Starting and finishing in Ashhurst village with gravel roads cutting through Pohangina watersheds delivers the mixed-surface challenge that actually matters. The Saturday Team Time Trial adds tactical depth beyond just showing up and suffering for 99 miles. High DNF rates mean you earn your finish, and Chapman's genuine enthusiasm suggests this isn't just marketing fluff about 'fun.'"

    "explanation": "Nine years of consistent operation (minus COVID 2022 and the mysterious 2025 postponement) shows staying power in a small market. International teams keep showing up for early season UCI points, which means the racing delivers what's promised. The move from Palmerston North to Feilding to now Ashhurst suggests they're willing to evolve the experience based on feedback."

    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "UCI 1.2 status pulls legitimate international squads hunting early season points, with past winners including WorldTour-level riders like Brodie Chapman and rising talents like Niamh Fisher-Black. But it's still New Zealand in October – you're not getting Tour de France depth here. The high attrition rate from gravel sections at least ensures whoever's left at the finish earned their place."

  "value": {
    "score": 5,
    "explanation": "You get 99 miles of legitimate suffering through Manawatū-Whanganui with both men's and women's races plus a Saturday TTT component. Two-day format with varied distances (155km men's, 91km women's) means multiple ways to engage. No entry fee data available, but given it's New Zealand and not some Euro monument, you're probably not getting gouged for the privilege of punishment."
  },
  "expenses": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Flying to New Zealand for a bike race isn't cheap from anywhere that matters, and October timing means you're hitting their spring season when accommodations cost more. The race bounced between Palmerston North, Feilding, and now Ashhurst, suggesting limited lodging options near the actual start. Plus they postponed 2025 entirely, so factor in the risk of your travel plans getting torched."

    "explanation": "99 miles with 6562 feet of climbing isn't messing around – that's a legitimate day in the saddle that will expose your fitness gaps. The men's 155km distance aligns with serious one-day racing standards, while the women's 91km option still demands respect. Add the Saturday TTT component and you're getting a proper two-day challenge, not some weekend warrior spin."

  "technicality": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Those 5-6 gravel sectors through Pohangina watersheds fracture the peloton with punctures and crashes, but it's still 75% sealed roads. High DNF rates suggest the gravel portions demand real bike handling skills, not just power. The mixed surface challenge tests more than pure watts, though it's not full technical mountain bike territory."
  },
  "elevation": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "6562 feet over 99 miles averages about 66 feet per mile – noticeable but not Alpine brutal. The gravel sectors hit watersheds around Pohangina, suggesting the climbs matter tactically even if they won't break you purely on gradient. Enough elevation to matter in the final selection, not enough to make climbing specialists the automatic winners."
  },
  "climate": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "October in New Zealand's Manawatū region means spring weather that could go either way – potentially perfect, potentially miserable. The race has survived multiple years without weather becoming the main story, suggesting conditions are generally rideable. No specific weather incidents in the research, which either means conditions are boring or the race isn't big enough for weather drama to make news."
  },
  "altitude": {
    "score": 1,
    "explanation": "Manawatū-Whanganui region sits near sea level – you're not getting any altitude training benefits or breathing challenges here. The watersheds around Pohangina aren't exactly high country, and the race finishes back in village elevation. If you need altitude to make a race interesting, this isn't your event."
  },
  "logistics": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The race has moved start locations three times in nine years – Palmerston North to Feilding to now Ashhurst – suggesting they haven't nailed the logistics formula yet. Postponing the entire 2025 edition doesn't inspire confidence in organizational stability. Small town New Zealand means limited infrastructure for race support, and the research shows zero details on basics like packet pickup or parking."

  "adventure": {
    "score": 5,
    "explanation": "Flying to New Zealand for a mixed-surface sufferfest that fractures pelotons and generates high DNF rates? That's adventure by definition. The gravel watersheds around Pohangina offer legitimate exploration potential beyond just the race route. Chapman's authentic excitement about the 'most fun ever' suggests this delivers the kind of experience you'll actually remember, not just another race to check off the list."
