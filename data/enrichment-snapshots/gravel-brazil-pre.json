    "explanation": "First UCI Gravel race in Southern America carries serious weight—you're making history just by showing up. The World Championship qualifier status puts it on the global radar, backed by the same crew who've been running UCI Gran Fondo Brazil for years. Only two editions deep but already positioned as the official gravel event for elite and amateur Brazilian athletes. Missing that fifth star because it's still building its legend."

  "race_quality": {
    "score": 4,
    "explanation": "UCI sanctioning means real organization standards, not some weekend warrior's fever dream. The team behind Gran Fondo Brazil knows how to run serious cycling events—they've been doing it annually in November for years. Riders Sports Experience has the infrastructure in place. Still early to call it flawless without more rider feedback from the trenches."
  },
  "experience": {
    "score": 5,
    "explanation": "You're pioneering gravel racing in Brazil—that's bucket list territory. Balneário Camboriú puts you in Santa Catarina's playground where mountains meet coast. The combination of being first to the party and racing in genuinely unexplored gravel territory makes this unforgettable. You'll have stories nobody else can tell."
  },
  "community": {
    "score": 4,
    "explanation": "Brazilian cycling culture runs deep, and you're tapping into something authentic here. The Gran Fondo foundation means there's already a passionate local scene that knows how to celebrate suffering properly. Early adopter vibes create tight bonds among participants. Missing perfection because the international community is still discovering this exists."
  },
  "field_depth": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Two distance options (69km and 113km) pull different crowds, but field composition remains a mystery. Being the only official Brazilian gravel race draws local talent, but international depth is still building. World Championship qualification potential attracts serious riders, but we're still early in the development curve. The real killers might still be figuring out this race exists."
  },
  "value": {
    "score": 5,
    "explanation": "First gravel race in Southern America for unknown entry fees? That's historical access at probably reasonable Brazilian pricing. You're getting World Championship qualifying opportunity without European price tags. The experience-to-cost ratio tilts heavily toward riders when you're pioneering new territory. Registration stays open until March 1st—no artificial scarcity games."
  },
  "expenses": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Getting to Balneário Camboriú means international flights for most riders, then domestic connections through Brazil's airport system. Santa Catarina isn't exactly a budget destination, but it's not São Paulo expensive either. March timing avoids peak tourist season pricing. The real cost is in the travel logistics, not the local expenses."
  },
  "length": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "62 miles sits in that middle ground—not quite epic, not quite a sprint. The 113km long option pushes toward proper gravel distance, but 69km short course keeps it accessible. Smart strategy for building a race, but serious gravel addicts want more suffering for their international travel investment. Distance options let you pick your poison."
  },
  "technicality": {
    "score": 4,
    "explanation": "Santa Catarina's terrain doesn't mess around—mountains dropping to coast create natural technical challenges. 6,562 feet of climbing in 62 miles suggests sustained difficulty, not just rolling hills. Brazilian mountain roads typically serve up legitimate technical sections, rocks, and gradient changes. Missing specific course details, but the topography promises real bike handling demands."
  },
  "elevation": {
    "score": 4,
    "explanation": "6,562 feet in 62 miles delivers over 100 feet of climbing per mile—that's legitimate gravel punishment. Santa Catarina's coastal mountains create sustained climbing, not gentle rollers. The elevation profile suggests multiple significant climbs rather than one mountain pass. Serious vertical for the distance, though not quite Alps-level suffering."
  },
  "climate": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "March 8th puts you in Brazilian autumn—theoretically cooler than summer madness but still tropical humidity. Santa Catarina's coast means unpredictable weather patterns and potential for everything from blazing sun to sudden storms. One prior edition means no historical weather pattern data to predict your suffering. Coastal mountain weather keeps you guessing."
  },
  "altitude": {
    "score": 1,
    "explanation": "Balneário Camboriú starts at sea level—your lungs won't notice any difference. Even with 6,562 feet of climbing, you're not reaching altitudes that affect oxygen availability. This is elevation gain, not altitude training. Sea level start means no acclimatization needed."
  },
  "logistics": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "International travel to a race with minimal available logistics information creates planning nightmares. No details on packet pickup, parking, or accommodation strategies found anywhere. Registration open until March 1st suggests they're not overwhelmed with organization complexity. You're flying blind on the practical details that make or break race weekends."
  },
  "adventure": {
    "score": 5,
    "explanation": "First UCI gravel race in Southern America—you're literally writing the book. Santa Catarina's unexplored gravel territory means nobody knows what you're getting into. Racing in Brazil's coastal mountains delivers genuine adventure, not manufactured experience. This is pure exploration disguised as a bike race."
