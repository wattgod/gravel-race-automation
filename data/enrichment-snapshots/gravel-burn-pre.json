    "explanation": "Nedbank as title sponsor and a groundbreaking 7-day, 800km stage race format puts this on the international gravel map from day one. The inaugural 2025 edition creates instant legend status – you're literally among the first humans to tackle this beast. Sure, it's not Unbound yet, but founding a new multi-day format in South Africa's most unforgiving terrain? That's how cycling legends start."

  "race_quality": {
    "score": 4,
    "explanation": "Full-service Burn Camps with two-night stays show they're not messing around with logistics and rider care. The routing from Knysna forests through the Great Karoo to Shamwari Game Reserve is masterfully planned – each stage builds the narrative. Stage breakdowns like the 7km Tarka Botha climb followed by steep descents prove they understand how to design suffering with purpose."
  },
  "experience": {
    "score": 5,
    "explanation": "Where else do you ride past Big Five wildlife while grinding through fossil-rich Karoo plains? The full immersion concept with Burn Camps creates actual recovery and storytelling time between stages – not just crash and dash. From Garden Route forests to semi-desert to bushveld, this is geography most cyclists will never see otherwise."
  },
  "community": {
    "score": 4,
    "explanation": "The 'everyone is welcome' philosophy backed by actual full-service support shows they get community building right from launch. Two-night Burn Camp stays force riders to actually connect instead of just racing past each other. Being inaugural edition means you're founding the tribe, not just joining it."
  },
  "field_depth": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Inaugural race means unknown field strength – could be hardcore adventurers or could be trust-fund tourists with nice bikes. The 7-day commitment and South African location will filter out casual participants, but pro depth remains to be seen. Give it three years to see who actually shows up to suffer through the Karoo."
  },
  "value": {
    "score": 5,
    "explanation": "Seven days, 800km, full-service Burn Camps, wildlife encounters, and airport transport options – this is expedition-level experience for stage race entry fees. Most riders pay more for a long weekend at Leadville and get a fraction of the adventure. The all-inclusive model eliminates the usual multi-day race headaches of finding food and shelter."
  },
  "expenses": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "International flight to Gqeberha plus seven days of racing and lodging adds up fast, even with race-organized transport options. The full-service model likely costs more upfront than bare-bones stage races, but eliminates surprise expenses. Budget for African adventure pricing, not domestic gravel race fees."
  },
  "length": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Individual stages range 90-140km, which hits the sweet spot for multi-day racing – long enough to matter, short enough to recover. Seven days total pushes most riders past their comfort zone without crossing into pure masochism. It's not ultra-distance per stage, but the cumulative load will break plenty of riders by day five."
  },
  "technicality": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Narrow, uneven gravel descents and varied terrain from forest to semi-desert suggest real skill demands, not just power grinding. The 10km descent from Blaauwater and steep drops after climbs like Tarka Botha will separate bike handlers from power meters. Without detailed surface breakdowns, assume African gravel means technical challenges most riders haven't seen."
  },
  "elevation": {
    "score": 4,
    "explanation": "11,000m over 800km averages serious climbing density, especially with features like the long drag to Conical Peak and the 7km Tarka Botha climb. Stage 3's 1,450m in 90km and Stage 7's 1,250m in 112km show they're not afraid to stack vertical. The lumpy bushveld terrain ensures constant elevation changes, not just a few big climbs."
  },
  "climate": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The Great Karoo is literally described as arid semi-desert where 'life clings to the edges and the hardiest creatures thrive' – that should tell you everything. October/November timing could mean brutal heat, sudden weather changes, or both. No weather data available, but semi-desert plus multi-day exposure equals serious climate challenges."
  },
  "altitude": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Starting in Knysna near sea level means most elevation is temporary climbing rather than sustained altitude stress. The route through Eastern Cape and Karoo likely stays under serious altitude thresholds for most riders. Without specific elevation profiles, assume standard South African highland riding, not Leadville-level oxygen debt."
  },
  "logistics": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "International travel to Gqeberha for a stage race spanning remote Karoo regions creates real complexity. While race-organized transport exists, you're still dealing with South African logistics, customs, and gear transport across multiple time zones. The full-service Burn Camps help, but getting there with your bike intact remains an adventure."
  },
  "adventure": {
    "score": 5,
    "explanation": "Riding through Big Five territory in fossil-rich semi-desert where 'the hardiest creatures thrive' maxes the adventure meter. You're literally crossing geological and ecological zones most humans never experience, let alone on a bike. The inaugural status means you're writing the first chapter of this race's story in some of Africa's most remote terrain."
