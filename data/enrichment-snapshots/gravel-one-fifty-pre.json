    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "UCI Gravel World Series qualifier status gives it legitimate racing credentials, but it's not exactly Unbound. The race bills itself as 'established' in the gravel calendar without providing founding year or any notable winners to back that claim. Netherlands gravel scene is solid but regional—you're not getting international bragging rights here."
  },
  "race_quality": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Roden Brink venue and UCI backing suggest decent organization, but the course description reads like marketing copy—'flat yet demanding' tells you nothing useful. No aid station details, no cutoff times, no specifics on what makes this race worth your Saturday. Professional oversight doesn't guarantee professional execution."
  },
  "experience": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Drenthe's 'fast gravel tracks' through Dutch countryside should deliver a solid day out, even if it won't challenge your climbing legs. The warning about 'potholes and changing conditions' suggests some legitimate technical variety beyond just smooth gravel highways. Two distance options (80km/150km) let you pick your pain level."
  },
  "community": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "UCI qualifier status draws serious riders, and Netherlands has strong cycling culture that should create decent race atmosphere. Regional European event means you'll get committed gravel heads rather than weekend warriors. No rider reviews or community feedback available though—always suspicious when nobody's talking about a race."
  },
  "field_depth": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "UCI qualifier brings legitimate competition, but it's Netherlands—small country, smaller talent pool. No field size data or past winner information suggests either secrecy or mediocre participation numbers. European gravel scene is growing but still developing compared to US depth."
  },
  "value": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "€95 for 150km UCI qualifier is reasonable by European race standards—not cheap but not Leadville robbery either. Registration opens November 1st with January 22nd early bird deadline, giving you time to plan. No prize purse mentioned, so you're paying for the experience and UCI points, not potential winnings."
  },
  "expenses": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Netherlands isn't budget travel—accommodation, food, and transport add up quickly in Western Europe. Roden location means you'll need rental car or complex train connections from major airports. No lodging recommendations provided, so you're figuring out logistics solo in an expensive country."
  },
  "length": {
    "score": 4,
    "explanation": "93 miles hits the gravel racing sweet spot—long enough to separate the committed from the curious, short enough to avoid death march territory. Four to six hours in the saddle depending on your fitness and course conditions. Distance works for both competitive types chasing UCI points and ambitious recreational riders."
  },
  "technicality": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Drenthe province gravel roads with 'potholes and changing conditions' suggests some bike handling required, but nothing that'll separate mountain bikers from roadies. 'Flat yet demanding' typically means wind and surface variety rather than technical descents or singletrack. Dutch infrastructure means maintained surfaces, not wilderness adventure."
  },
  "elevation": {
    "score": 1,
    "explanation": "800 feet over 93 miles in the Netherlands—you'll get more climbing riding to the grocery store in Colorado. Drenthe province is famously flat, built for spinning big gears rather than grinding climbs. Wind will be your enemy here, not gravity."
  },
  "climate": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "July 2025 and April 2026 dates avoid winter misery but guarantee wind exposure on flat Dutch terrain. Spring and summer in Netherlands means changeable conditions—could be perfect 70°F sunshine or sideways rain. No historical weather incidents reported, suggesting manageable conditions most years."
  },
  "altitude": {
    "score": 1,
    "explanation": "Sea level Netherlands means altitude isn't a factor unless you're coming from Death Valley. No acclimatization needed, no performance impact from thin air. Your legs will hurt from wind and distance, not oxygen debt."
  },
  "logistics": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Roden Brink 2 venue provides specific address, and Netherlands infrastructure means reliable transport options. No airport or accommodation guidance provided, forcing you to figure out European logistics yourself. Start times announced 'closer to event date' suggests decent organization but poor communication."
  },
  "adventure": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Dutch gravel roads through Drenthe countryside offer pleasant scenery but limited wilderness factor. You're riding maintained tracks in densely populated Western Europe, not exploring remote backcountry. UCI qualifier format means following marked course rather than navigation challenges or true exploration."
