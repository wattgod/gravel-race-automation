    "explanation": "The race starts at UCI headquarters in Aigle and now attracts 550+ riders annually. Elite winner Sophie Wright celebrated her UCI World Series victory, showing the organizational infrastructure can handle serious competition. Geneva Airport remains 80km away with unpublished packet pickup details."

  "length": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Andreas Seewald won the 2025 men's race in 3:37:47 after \"five climbs shattered the field.\" The 65-mile distance with substantial climbing creates decisive gaps - Seewald finished over 5 minutes ahead of second place, showing the course length allows strong climbers to separate."
  },
  "technicality": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The 2024 edition featured \"muddy, wet and gritty\" conditions according to race reports. The course includes a \"very steep 20% section\" on Route des Chaux, but technical challenge comes from weather and gradient rather than handling skills. Most terrain remains forest roads and farm tracks."
  },
  "elevation": {
    "score": 4,
    "explanation": "The Summit route climbs 3,440m over 104km, reaching 1,819m at its highest point. After the first 50km through the Rhone valley, the second half delivers 2,300m of the total climbing. The race is consistently \"decided on the final climb\" with steep gradients separating contenders."
  },
  "climate": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The 2024 race dealt with challenging weather that created \"muddy, wet and gritty\" course conditions. Late June to mid-July alpine weather can shift quickly from mild summer conditions to rain that transforms the gravel sections into technical challenges."
  },
  "altitude": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Starting from UCI headquarters in Aigle at 380m elevation, the course climbs to 1,819m at its highest point 11km before the finish. The substantial altitude gain affects pacing, but you're not hitting oxygen-limiting elevations that would impact sea-level riders significantly."
  },
  "adventure": {
    "score": 4,
    "explanation": "The route starts at the UCI headquarters doorstep and climbs through the Vaudois Alps with \"beautiful vistas.\" After 50km, riders enter \"mostly offroad\" terrain through alpine forests. One YouTube rider called it \"The most beautiful yet disappointing race of the season.\""
  },
  "prestige": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Sophie Wright's celebration - \"I dream of days like this...today, it became reality. UCI World Series win. Feeling good as hell!!!\" - shows elite riders value the victory. However, 2024 winner Olivier Godfroid was a former shoe salesman who turned pro just two years prior."
  },
  "race_quality": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The race has been awarded the 2029 UCI Gravel World Championships, indicating organizational growth. However, Olivier Godfroid won in 2024 as a relative newcomer to professional cycling, suggesting the competitive field remains developing for a UCI World Series event."
  },
  "experience": {
    "score": 4,
    "explanation": "Elite winner Sophie Wright's euphoric reaction captures the course experience. The route features a 5km offroad climb at 10% gradient after Ollon, then \"mostly offroad\" terrain through alpine forests in the second half. Riders describe it as \"tough with lots of climbing and beautiful vistas.\""
  },
  "community": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Over 550 riders participated in 2024, with top 25% qualifying for UCI Gravel World Championships. The course is \"easy accessible for spectators who can ride from one part to another making shortcuts.\" It's paired with UCI Gran Fondo Suisse for a cycling weekend."
  },
  "field_depth": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The 2025 women's race saw Sophie Wright win solo with over 7 minutes to second place. In 2024, Olivier Godfroid - a former shoe salesman turned pro - won after surging past Petr Vakoc. Large winning margins suggest limited depth in competitive categories."
  },
  "value": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The race earned selection to host the 2029 UCI Gravel World Championships, indicating quality course design. With 550+ participants and automatic Worlds qualification for top 25%, it delivers UCI Series credentials. Entry fees remain unpublished, typical for Swiss premium pricing."
  },
  "expenses": {
    "score": 1,
    "explanation": "You're racing in Switzerland with accommodations in Villars, a resort village in the Vaud Alps. Swiss pricing will impact every aspect from lodging to meals. Geneva Airport is 80km away, adding international flights and rental car costs to already premium Swiss expenses."
