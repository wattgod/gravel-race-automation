    "explanation": "Being the first UCI Gravel World Series qualifier worldwide for 2025 should mean something, but nobody knows this race exists. They moved from Beechworth to Seymour in 2025 and reset their reputation to zero. Over 500 riders sounds decent until you realize that's small change in the gravel world, and the data void on past winners tells you everything about their marketing game."

  "race_quality": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The course design is solid—two 43km loops with 82% gravel through actual farmland, not manufactured adventure. Wicket Hill at 11% average grade gives you something to remember, and the rolling Goulburn Valley terrain keeps it honest. The 137km route with 1,750m of climbing hits the sweet spot between weekend warrior accessible and legitimately challenging."
  },
  "experience": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "You're riding through legitimate Australian countryside with Strathbogie Ranges vistas that actually matter. Starting and finishing at Seymour Racecourse gives it proper event feel, and the two-loop format means spectators can see you suffer twice. The terrain from 155m to 520m elevation keeps the scenery changing, though the experience caps out at 'very pleasant' rather than life-changing."
  },
  "community": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The field spans recreational 14-year-olds to UCI age category warriors, which creates decent energy but also means wildly different pace groups. Sports nutrition, fruit, and bakery goods at aid stations suggests they understand cyclist priorities. Moving to a new venue in Seymour shows they're willing to evolve, but also means the community has to rebuild from scratch."
  },
  "field_depth": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Over 500 riders for an Australian gravel race isn't embarrassing, but it's not drawing international talent either. The UCI qualifier status should attract serious amateurs hunting World Championship slots, but the complete absence of notable past winners in the research tells you the depth story. You'll find decent competition in age groups, just don't expect WorldTour crossover talent."
  },
  "value": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "$215 AUD entry gets you 137km of quality gravel, aid stations with real food, and a shot at UCI Worlds qualification. That's reasonable for what you're getting, especially with the racecourse venue and organized logistics. Not cheap, but not gouging either—standard pricing for a legitimate gravel event in Australia."
  },
  "expenses": {
    "score": 1,
    "explanation": "Getting to Seymour, Victoria means expensive flights if you're international, and even domestic Australian travel isn't cheap. The research shows zero information on lodging options beyond Seymour being a 'hidden gem,' which usually means limited accommodation and inflated weekend rates. Add bike shipping, meals, and rental car, and you're looking at serious money for a race most people haven't heard of."
  },
  "length": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The 137km main event with multiple distance options (95km, 50km) gives everyone a viable challenge without being stupidly long. At 85 miles, it's proper gravel race distance—long enough to hurt, short enough to not destroy your weekend. The two-loop format after a neutral start keeps logistics simple while delivering sufficient suffering."
  },
  "technicality": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "This is wide-open gravel roads through farmland, not technical singletrack or gnarly descents. The course description emphasizes 'excellent road quality' and 'fast,' which means smooth sailing for most riders. Wicket Hill's 11% grade and some undulating sections provide challenge, but it's power and fitness, not bike handling skills."
  },
  "elevation": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "1,750m of climbing over 137km gives you constant work without being mountainous. Wicket Hill hits twice at 125m gain each time, and the range from 155m to 520m keeps things rolling. It's enough to separate the field but won't destroy climbers or completely eliminate powerful riders—middle-ground elevation that favors well-rounded engines."
  },
  "climate": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Late October in Victoria hits the sweet spot—spring weather that's warm but not scorching. The 2025 forecast expected rain to keep dust down, which is perfect for gravel riding. You're avoiding the brutal Australian summer heat while getting stable spring conditions, though weather can still flip quickly in that region."
  },
  "altitude": {
    "score": 1,
    "explanation": "Starting around 550m and maxing out at 520-837m means zero altitude considerations for performance. This is basically sea level for training adaptations—your VO2 max stays exactly where it is at home. No altitude training benefit, no need for acclimatization, just normal oxygen levels throughout."
  },
  "logistics": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The research data is a logistics information black hole—no airport details, no specific lodging recommendations, no parking information. Starting at Seymour Racecourse sounds organized, but the move from Beechworth means they're still figuring out the operational details. When basic logistical information isn't readily available, that's usually a red flag for race organization."
  },
  "adventure": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Riding through Wallaby Gully Flora Reserve and the Goulburn Valley delivers legitimate Australian countryside, not suburban bike paths masquerading as gravel. The course takes you to places you wouldn't normally ride, with genuine farmland and range vistas. It's real adventure without being stupidly remote—you're exploring proper terrain while staying within civilization's reach."
