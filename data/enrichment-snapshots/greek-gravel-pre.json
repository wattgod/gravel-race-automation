    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Complete information blackout - no airport recommendations, no lodging strategy, no packet pickup details. The UCI Gran Fondo Greece manages Athens pickup locations and Loutraki race-day service, showing it can be done. This event offers zero logistical guidance for international travelers."
  },
  "length": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "65 miles hits the sweet spot - long enough to hurt, short enough to finish before dark. Kalle Rovanperä noted \"there is still a long way to go to the end of the rally\" even on this distance. Similar to the UCI Gran Fondo Greece's 105km distance, it's a proper day's work without requiring overnight strategy."
  },
  "technicality": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Elfyn Evans describes \"a hard and rocky base and a lot of loose rocks\" while Sébastien Ogier warns of \"rough and rocky surface\" conditions. The terrain includes technical sections where mechanical failures are common - Belgian driver Ghislain de Mevius \"succumbed to mechanical issues on day two\" despite running podium pace."
  },
  "elevation": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "4500 feet over 65 miles delivers quality climbing density through the Peloponnese mountains. Jari-Matti Latvala notes the roads are \"wider and faster than in Sardinia\" but still demanding enough that teams need \"a very good Friday to keep themselves in the fight for the rest of the rally.\""
  },
  "climate": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The \"trademark mix of searing heat, rocky gravel\" defines the experience here. Recent events moved to summer dates brought \"the possibility of harsher conditions\" with \"high temperatures\" that proved \"really exhausting for all\" according to local observer Katerina Bratsou during August testing sessions."
  },
  "altitude": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Peloponnese mountains stay modest - no oxygen concerns, no altitude training needed. Most riding stays well under 2000 meters, so sea-level lungs work fine. The region's highest peaks barely crack 2400 meters, keeping this firmly in the breathable zone."
  },
  "adventure": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The Caroutes area features \"lot of technical sections\" that are \"really close to nature\" with no communication networks available. German crew Siegfried and Renate Mayr \"overcame a transmission failure thanks to spare parts generously loaned overnight by fellow competitor Pasi Hapulahti\" - true adventure cycling spirit in remote terrain."
  },
  "prestige": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Elite WRC drivers like Kalle Rovanperä and Sébastien Ogier compete on these same Greek gravel roads, lending credibility to the terrain. However, the cycling event itself lacks official recognition or documented race history. The roads have motorsport pedigree but the bike race remains unestablished."
  },
  "race_quality": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "No documented race infrastructure, timing systems, or aid stations exist for this cycling event. The terrain quality is proven - Jari-Matti Latvala experienced \"a scare on SS5 when a sudden misfire threatened to derail their charge\" on these demanding roads. The surface delivers, but race organization remains invisible."
  },
  "experience": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The same gravel roads that challenge WRC professionals offer intense riding through historical landscapes. Kalle Rovanperä found it \"really enjoyable\" despite \"four difficult stages\" with surprisingly \"big time gaps.\" At 65 miles with 4500 feet of elevation, you get a proper workout through terrain that's tested the world's best drivers."
  },
  "community": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Greek cycling culture runs deep with enthusiastic spectator support. Katerina Bratsou observed fans getting their \"dose four days in row\" even during beach season, showing \"the lack of international races which our country used to host.\" Local pairings like \"Alexandrou Christodoulou and Athanassios Samaras earned plaudits for their spirited run.\""
  },
  "field_depth": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "No field size data or past results exist for this cycling event. While the terrain attracts elite motorsport talent - with drivers noting they \"will need a very good Friday to keep themselves in the fight\" - the bike race itself shows no documented competitive field or participation records."
  },
  "value": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Greek events typically offer reasonable pricing compared to Western European races, with the region's exchange rates working in international visitors' favor. The spectator enthusiasm - fans showing up \"in a month which most people spend on beach\" - suggests strong local support and cultural value for cycling events in this area."
  },
  "expenses": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Greece requires Athens connections for international travel, and the Peloponnese adds logistical complexity. No race packet pickup locations, recommended lodging, or parking details are available. The 2025 rally route included service parks around Lamia, suggesting infrastructure exists but race-specific guidance remains absent."
