    "score": 4,
    "explanation": "Grinduro isn't Unbound-level famous, but it's earned iconic status within gravel culture. Voted 'Event of the Year' by Design and Innovation Awards. The series created an entirely new race format that has influenced the sport. Past winners include former American Downhill Champion Duncan Riffle, pro cyclocross racers like Katerina Nash and Meredith Miller, and World Tour riders like Tiffany Cromwell (Canyon/SRAM). It's nationally significant and internationally recognized, but not quite the household name of the major series races."

  "race_quality": {
    "score": 4,
    "explanation": "Professional organization with quality timing systems across timed segments. Aid stations and feed zones strategically placed in untimed liaison sections. However, the 'black pill' truths are real: flat tire epidemics are endemic ('dozens of flat tires, particularly on the final timed segment'), cutoff times have left riders in tears, and course difficulty is often underestimated. The production is professional, but the event's wildness creates quality variance."
  },
  "experience": {
    "score": 5,
    "explanation": "Life-changing is not hyperbole here. Forum reviews are unanimously glowing: 'The most fun I've ever had with drop bars.' The format is genius - 'fully satisfy that competitive itch, then regroup with your mates and chat your way to the start of the next segment.' Festival atmosphere with live music, handbuilt bike show, gourmet food, and camping communities creates something beyond a race. 'Perfect party to race ratio' captures it perfectly."
  },
  "community": {
    "score": 5,
    "explanation": "Legendary community spirit is Grinduro's defining characteristic. 'In a famously tribal community, Grinduro creates a space where pros and beginners ride the same course, share the same struggles, and celebrate the same achievements.' Elitism has no place - everyone is genuinely welcome. The format eliminates start-line anxiety and road-rage mid-race because timed sections are brief. Theme camps, vibrant tented communities, and shared suffering create bonds. This is a 10/10 community score per the research."
  },
  "field_depth": {
    "score": 4,
    "explanation": "Strong pro attendance across disciplines - not just gravel specialists. Winners include former professional downhill racers, pro road racers, current cyclocross pros like Katerina Nash, Meredith Miller, and Rebecca Fahringer, plus World Tour rider Tiffany Cromwell. Michael van den Ham (Canadian champion) has won. The cross-discipline appeal means you're racing against genuine talent from MTB, road, and CX, but this isn't an major series stop with mandatory pro attendance."
  },
  "value": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Entry fees run $180-235 USD (£150 GBP for UK), which is substantial for a single-day event. However, inclusion matters: breakfast, lunch, dinner on race day, camping, live music, festival access, bike expo, and aid stations are all bundled in. The all-inclusive nature partially justifies the cost, but forum debates exist - 'If it's worth it, pay it. If it isn't, don't.' Compared to events like Unbound ($130-200+), it's in the upper range for what you get."
  },
  "expenses": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Total trip cost is moderate to high. Entry: $180-235. Camping is included (tent camping) but is basic fairground camping, not glamping. Remote locations mean driving from major airports/cities. International events (Scotland, Italy, Japan, South Africa) require significant travel investment - flights, rental cars, potentially ferry crossings. Scotland events have faced Brexit-related sponsor complications adding cost pressure. Budget $500-1,000+ depending on location."
  },
  "length": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Main courses range from 56-73 miles (California to Pennsylvania), placing it in the 40-60 mile category. While the total loop distance is moderate, the unique format means only 20-60 minutes of actual racing across 4 timed segments. The Grindurito half-course option (~27-34 miles) makes it accessible to newer riders."
  },
  "technicality": {
    "score": 5,
    "explanation": "Grinduro pushes the boundaries of what a gravel bike can handle. Courses feature singletrack descents (10-mile singletrack descent in California), MTB-style technical sections with A-line and B-line options (Wales), steep loose slate, and terrain that has been won by former professional downhill racers. The research explicitly notes 'the last timed segment would probably have been best tackled on a full suspension mountain bike' - this is extreme terrain for gravel bikes."
  },
  "elevation": {
    "score": 4,
    "explanation": "California flagship event packs 7,800 feet of climbing into 56 miles - that's 139 feet per mile, a punishing ratio. Pennsylvania adds ~6,000-6,250 feet, while international events (Italy, South Africa) hit 1,500m/4,900ft. The China Grade climb in California averages 10% with sections over 20%. This isn't casual climbing."
  },
  "climate": {
    "score": 4,
    "explanation": "Weather is the true wildcard across the series. Scotland is notorious - 'the weather cycles between steady drizzle, heavy mist and occasional downpour' with courses turning into 'skating rinks of mud-greased grass.' California 2019 saw snow and hail. Even 'usually sunny' California sits at high elevation where weather apps show snowflake icons for September dates. Scotland specifically earns a 4/10 weather rating in the research."
  },
  "altitude": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "California events sit in the Sierra Nevada at elevation, with courses reaching significant altitude on mountain climbs. Pennsylvania peaks at ~2,051 feet (modest), but California and Scotland (Highlands) operate at elevations between 3,000-6,000 feet where the thin air starts to matter. Not extreme altitude racing, but enough to feel it on the climbs."
  },
  "logistics": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Remote locations are a feature, not a bug. Quincy, California requires driving from Sacramento or Reno with no nearby airport. Scotland's Isle of Arran events required CalMac Ferry crossings. Japan is 90 minutes by bullet train from Tokyo. Italy requires a medical certificate from the Italian Cycling Federation. Camping at fairgrounds is the norm, not hotels. Brexit complications nearly killed UK events with customs fees hitting sponsors."
  },
  "adventure": {
    "score": 5,
    "explanation": "Grinduro delivers bucket-list experiences across three continents. The unique enduro format - invented here in 2015 - creates something genuinely different: race hard for 5-15 minute timed segments, then cruise with friends through stunning scenery. Forum consensus: 'Without a doubt, Grinduro was the most fun I've ever had with drop bars.' The festival atmosphere with live music, gourmet food, bike expo, and camping communities adds to the life-changing experience."
