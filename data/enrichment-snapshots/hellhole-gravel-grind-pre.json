  "prestige": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Running since at least 2018 with Mt. Pleasant Velo organizing, but this isn't making waves outside South Carolina. No pro field mentioned, no notable past winners documented, and the race reports are basically non-existent online. It's a legitimate stage race format, but prestige requires people actually knowing it exists."
  },
  "race_quality": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The organization shows some structure - proper stage race timing, Francis Marion National Forest permits, mandatory rider meetings at 8:45 AM. But 7-hour cutoffs for each stage suggest they're not expecting fast times, and the lack of detailed course info or elevation profiles feels amateur hour. Real stage races don't leave you guessing about what you're getting into."
  },
  "experience": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Three days of racing through Francis Marion National Forest with a Friday night prologue and post-race food from Roe Roes Philippine Cuisine creates some memorable moments. The reversed course from Day 1 to Day 2 shows thought, and 90% unpaved roads delivers the gravel goods. Mid-race gathering at Commonhouse Aleworks Saturday evening adds social value most races skip."
  },
  "community": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Mt. Pleasant Velo has kept this running for 7+ years, which takes dedicated locals who care. The Saturday evening brewery gathering and organized post-race meals show they're building something beyond just timing chips. But the limited online presence and mystery around field sizes suggests the community hasn't grown much beyond the core group."
  },
  "field_depth": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "No field size data available and zero mention of competitive depth or notable finishers in any documentation. The 7-hour stage cutoffs and 5-hour cutoff for the 45-mile fondo suggest they're accommodating recreational riders, not attracting serious competition. Regional South Carolina event that hasn't pulled talent from outside the area."
  },
  "value": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Three days of racing with prologue, two stages, and fondo options gives you multiple ways to suffer for your entry fee. Francis Marion National Forest setting and organized food/beer elements add value beyond just course marking. Registration costs aren't published, but 150 total miles of South Carolina gravel should deliver decent bang for buck."
  },
  "expenses": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Jamestown area near Charleston keeps lodging costs reasonable compared to major metro areas, and the Saturday brewery gathering plus Sunday post-race food reduces meal planning stress. Multiple start locations at Steelshed Lane and Hellhole Road Primitive Camp with available parking eliminates shuttle fees. No airport or travel cost data available, but coastal South Carolina isn't breaking budgets."
  },
  "length": {
    "score": 4,
    "explanation": "150 total miles over two stages plus 6-mile prologue delivers proper stage race volume that separates pretenders from contenders. Two 75-mile days back-to-back tests cumulative fatigue in ways single-day events can't touch. The 75-mile and 45-mile fondo options give mortals an out, but the stage race distance demands respect."
  },
  "technicality": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "90% unpaved roads and trails through Francis Marion National Forest suggests some roots and sand, but coastal South Carolina terrain doesn't deliver the rock gardens or sustained technical challenges that break wheels and spirits. Single and double track sections add variety, but this isn't the kind of technical suffering that makes grown men cry."
  },
  "elevation": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "6000 feet over 150 miles averages 40 feet per mile - that's rolling terrain that won't destroy your legs or lungs. Coastal South Carolina geography near Jamestown means you're dealing with gentle rises, not sustained climbs that test character. The reversed course Day 1 to Day 2 shows some thought about elevation variety, but this isn't mountain gravel."
  },
  "climate": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "October in coastal South Carolina brings heat and humidity that northern riders underestimate, plus the prologue requiring lights suggests you're racing into darkness and potentially cooler temps. No weather incident history documented, but late summer conditions near Charleston can still cook you. Coastal location means weather can change fast when systems move through."
  },
  "altitude": {
    "score": 1,
    "explanation": "Sea-level coastal terrain around Jamestown and Cordesville means altitude isn't a factor in your suffering equation. Francis Marion National Forest sits in lowland country where the biggest elevation concern is staying above flood stage. If you're looking for thin air to test your lungs, look elsewhere."
  },
  "logistics": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Number pickup starting at 7:00 AM race day morning creates unnecessary stress, and bouncing between Steelshed Lane and Hellhole Road Primitive Camp for different events complicates planning. Available parking helps, but no detailed lodging or airport information leaves you figuring out basics on your own. The mandatory 8:45 AM rider meeting adds another timeline constraint."
  },
  "adventure": {
    "score": 4,
    "explanation": "Francis Marion National Forest provides legitimate backcountry gravel through single and double track that most road riders never see. Friday night prologue with required lights, reversed courses, and three days of exploring coastal South Carolina wilderness delivers the adventure factor. 90% unpaved roads take you far from civilization where real gravel racing happens."
