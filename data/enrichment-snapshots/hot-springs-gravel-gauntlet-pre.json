    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Part of the Southeast Gravel Series but buried as event 3 of 4 in a regional circuit most people haven't heard of. No prize purse, no notable winners in the research, just marketing fluff about being \"one of the most exciting venues in the Southeast.\" That's what every small race says when they can't point to actual accomplishments."
  },
  "race_quality": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Organized by Southeast Gravel out of Greenville, SC, but basic details like aid stations, cutoff times, and surface breakdown are mysteriously absent. They offer GPS files and a Friday pre-ride of River Road, which suggests some effort. But when a race can't tell you what you're actually riding on, that's a red flag about organization depth."
  },
  "experience": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Hot Springs location delivers mountain suffering with actual elevation, plus they throw a pre-race party at Big Pillow Brewery with pro Q&A. Saturday night camping with food and hangouts shows they understand post-race bonding matters. The \"mountains of Hot Springs\" promise pain, and that River Road pre-ride suggests they know which sections will break people."
  },
  "community": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Friday night brewery Q&A with pros and Saturday post-race camping creates actual community touchpoints beyond just showing up and racing. Being part of a 4-race omnium means you'll see familiar faces across events. But with a 200-rider pricing cap and regional focus, you're not exactly joining cycling's inner circle."
  },
  "field_depth": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Pricing structure caps early registration at 200 riders, suggesting a small field without serious competitive depth. No mention of categories, prize money, or notable participants means you're racing weekend warriors and series chasers. The omnium format might attract some committed regional riders, but don't expect WorldTour guys taking a gravel vacation."
  },
  "value": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "$85 early entry gets you 61 mountainous miles, a custom water bottle, pre-race party, and post-race camping with food. That's reasonable for what appears to be a well-supported weekend experience. The $40 youth pricing shows they actually want to build the sport, not just extract maximum dollars from adults."
  },
  "expenses": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Hot Springs, North Carolina isn't exactly a destination resort, so lodging and food costs should be manageable. Post-race camping option eliminates Saturday night hotel expenses if you don't mind sleeping rough after 61 miles of mountain gravel. No major airport nearby means driving for most people, but regional accessibility keeps total trip costs reasonable."
  },
  "length": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "61 miles hits the sweet spot between meaningful challenge and actually finishing before dark. Not the 100+ mile sufferfests that separate masochists from mortals, but long enough that you can't just power through on fitness alone. Three distance options (61, 28, 13 miles) means everyone from beginners to regulars finds their appropriate dose of mountain punishment."
  },
  "technicality": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Mountain terrain in Hot Springs suggests legitimate technical challenges, but the research offers zero details about surface breakdown or specific technical features. The fact they pre-ride River Road implies that section requires navigation or skill beyond just pedaling hard. Without knowing gravel vs. singletrack vs. pavement percentages, I'm guessing based on Appalachian geography."
  },
  "elevation": {
    "score": 4,
    "explanation": "\"Mountains of Hot Springs\" marketed as the tougher omnium venue, and Appalachian geography doesn't lie about vertical gain. The course description emphasizes mountainous terrain as a key selling point for omnium points chasers. GPS files available suggest significant climbing, though specific elevation numbers remain mysteriously absent from all promotional materials."
  },
  "climate": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "May in North Carolina mountains means unpredictable spring weather - could be perfect 70-degree sunshine or 45-degree rain that turns gravel into peanut butter. No historical weather data available, but mountain microclimates and spring timing create serious variability. You're gambling on conditions that could make or break the entire experience."
  },
  "altitude": {
    "score": 1,
    "explanation": "Hot Springs sits around 1,300 feet elevation in the Appalachians - basically sea level for anyone who's raced out West. Even the highest peaks in the area won't create meaningful altitude effects for performance or acclimatization. This is about gradient and distance, not thin air."
  },
  "logistics": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Research reveals almost nothing about parking, exact start location, or nearest airports - basic logistical details mysteriously absent. Friday night packet pickup at brewery party and Saturday morning option shows some planning. But when you can't find fundamental information about how to actually show up and race, that suggests organizational gaps that matter."
  },
  "adventure": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Hot Springs area offers legitimate mountain terrain with the Appalachian Trail and French Broad River nearby for exploration. Post-race camping and brewery scene create opportunities beyond just the race itself. Being part of a 4-race omnium adds adventure for series chasers willing to travel the Southeast circuit, though regional scope limits the true expedition factor."
