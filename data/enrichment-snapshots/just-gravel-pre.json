  "logistics": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Sign on opens at 08:45 with start window from 09:45-10:00am, and the Forestry England site provides guaranteed parking, toilets, and on-site cafe. Professional course marking and qualified mechanics/medics at feed stations show proper organization, though basic infrastructure lacks the polish of established racing events."
  },
  "length": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Three clear distance options: Family (15km), Fun (32km), and Challenge (45km), though the advertised 50-mile distance creates confusion about which route structure applies. The graduated format serves different abilities well, but distance inconsistencies suggest organizational gaps."
  },
  "technicality": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "\"All courses are on wide, well-surfaced gravel trails\" with \"only a very short section of linking road\" on longer routes. Described as \"ideally suited to gravel or off-road bikes,\" the smooth forestry trails provide manageable technical challenge without punishing difficulty through Grizedale's forest network."
  },
  "elevation": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "4000 feet over the Challenge distance delivers solid climbing through \"Forestry England's hidden gems\" without being excessive. The southern Lakes terrain provides enough vertical challenge to test fitness while remaining accessible to the event's target audience of gravel newcomers and families."
  },
  "climate": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Mid-September in the Lake District carries typical unpredictability, though organizers promote autumn timing when \"the forest trails will be at their best.\" The Grizedale Forest setting provides some shelter, but weather remains a significant variable in this famously wet region."
  },
  "altitude": {
    "score": 1,
    "explanation": "Southern Lake District elevation presents no altitude considerations for performance or acclimatization. You're dealing with proper hills and gradients through Grizedale Forest, but at sea-level air density throughout the event."
  },
  "adventure": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "\"Pure gravel\" and \"traffic-free gravel challenge\" through \"Forestry England's hidden gems\" in Grizedale Forest. The setting is described as \"best seen in autumn when the forest trails will be at their best,\" delivering proper Lake District adventure without requiring mountain rescue on standby."
  },
  "prestige": {
    "score": 1,
    "explanation": "Explicitly states \"THE EVENTS ARE NOT RACES\" but rather gravel challenges where \"Family and Fun courses are an opportunity to get started with gravel riding.\" When your event emphasizes accessibility over competition and targets newcomers, you're building participation rather than racing prestige."
  },
  "race_quality": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "No competitive structure since these are explicitly \"not races,\" but professional course marking and qualified mechanics/medics at feed stations show proper event organization. All riders receive number boards and timing despite the non-competitive format."
  },
  "experience": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Grizedale Forest delivers iconic Lake District terrain with flexible route structure letting you pick your challenge level. The \"perfect location for a full family day\" includes on-site catering, bike shop, and Go Ape activities, though without competitive edge it's essentially a supported group ride."
  },
  "community": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Designed with \"guaranteed places for women riders and families\" plus \"twenty bursary places for those on low income.\" One child per adult goes free, creating an accessible community rather than the hardcore gravel racing culture found at competitive events."
  },
  "field_depth": {
    "score": 1,
    "explanation": "Target audience explicitly includes families and beginners seeking gravel introduction, with the Challenge Event \"for fitter riders or those with some gravel or off-road experience.\" The non-competitive format serves community building over attracting serious competitive depth."
  },
  "value": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Professional course marking, GPX files, mechanical and medical support, plus timing for all riders through quality Forestry England terrain. The graduated distance options mean families and fitter riders can participate in the same well-supported event structure."
  },
  "expenses": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Lake District location means typical UK tourism costs, though the Grizedale Forest site includes \"ample parking, toilets, on-site catering, bike shop and bike hire\" to contain some expenses. September timing avoids peak summer pricing but carries shoulder-season Lake District premiums."
