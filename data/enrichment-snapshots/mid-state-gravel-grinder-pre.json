  "prestige": {
    "score": 1,
    "explanation": "This is a regional PA gravel race that barely registers on the national radar. No notable pro riders, no prize purse, no YouTube coverage — just basic event listings on BikeReg and RaceRoster. The fact that they had to move the 2026 date to August 15th and start from an airport road address tells you everything about their draw power."
  },
  "race_quality": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The race exists and happens consistently, with 2025 and 2026 editions scheduled in Philipsburg. But zero course details, no aid station info, no cutoff times — this screams bare-bones operation. When your entire race description is 'continue gravel races around Pennsylvania,' you're not exactly setting the bar high."
  },
  "experience": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Philipsburg isn't exactly a destination town, and starting at 9 AM from an airport road doesn't scream memorable experience. No rider reviews, no race reports, no 'what I wish I knew' insights anywhere online. The silence is deafening — either nobody talks about it or nobody remembers it."
  },
  "community": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "It's a local PA gravel scene event that keeps the regional riders busy in August. Listed across multiple platforms suggests some established community support, but the complete absence of rider chatter online is telling. You'll find your people, but don't expect deep connections or lasting friendships."
  },
  "field_depth": {
    "score": 1,
    "explanation": "No field size data, no notable past winners, no pro presence whatsoever. This is weekend warrior territory through and through. If you're looking to test yourself against serious competition, keep looking — this field won't challenge anyone beyond the local club level."
  },
  "value": {
    "score": 4,
    "explanation": "Here's where this race actually delivers — you get 50 miles and 3500 feet of Pennsylvania gravel without breaking the bank. No inflated entry fees, no mandatory swag packages, just straightforward racing. For regional riders who want saddle time without the Unbound price tag, this works."
  },
  "expenses": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Philipsburg keeps costs reasonable compared to destination races, and you're not far from State College if you need real lodging options. Starting from Airport Road means parking shouldn't be an issue. Nothing fancy, nothing expensive — exactly what you'd expect from central Pennsylvania."
  },
  "length": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Fifty miles hits that awkward middle distance — too long for a quick Saturday morning burn, too short to feel like you accomplished something significant. It's fine for building base miles or if you've got afternoon plans, but it won't satisfy anyone looking for a real gravel test."
  },
  "technicality": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Central Pennsylvania gravel tends toward the manageable side — some chunky sections but nothing that'll separate the wheat from the chaff. No course details available, but this region doesn't typically serve up the rock gardens or sustained technical challenges that define harder races. Expect rideable throughout."
  },
  "elevation": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "3500 feet over 50 miles averages 70 feet per mile — noticeable but not punishing. Pennsylvania's rolling terrain means you'll get consistent climbing without any signature long ascents. Enough to feel it in your legs, not enough to make anyone DNF from elevation alone."
  },
  "climate": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Early August in central PA means heat, humidity, and potential afternoon thunderstorms. The 9 AM start helps you beat the worst of it, but you'll still be grinding through that sticky Pennsylvania summer air. Not dangerous, just uncomfortable — bring extra bottles."
  },
  "altitude": {
    "score": 1,
    "explanation": "Philipsburg sits around 1500 feet — basically sea level for anyone who's ridden real mountains. Zero altitude considerations, zero acclimatization needed. If you can breathe normally at home, you'll breathe fine here."
  },
  "logistics": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Starting from Airport Road in Philipsburg tells you this isn't a polished operation — probably using whatever parking they can get. No packet pickup details, no clear logistics info anywhere online. You'll figure it out when you get there, but don't expect hand-holding."
  },
  "adventure": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Central Pennsylvania gravel through farm country and forest roads — pleasant enough but nothing that'll make your Instagram followers jealous. No signature views, no bucket-list terrain, just honest miles through honest country. Adventure-adjacent at best."
