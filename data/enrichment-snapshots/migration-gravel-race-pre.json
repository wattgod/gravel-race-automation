    "explanation": "They call it 'the hardest and wildest gravel race in the world' and that's not marketing bullshit when you're dodging elephants on Stage 2. Only two years in and already hailed as legendary, though it needs more time to build the winner mythology. Being offered as a double-header with UCI Gravel Qualifier Safari Gravel Race adds some official weight to the madness."
  },
  "race_quality": {
    "score": 4,
    "explanation": "Four stages, 650km, 8,000m of climbing through legitimate wilderness where wildlife has right of way. The course design is diabolical - Stage 4's Loita Hills climb into Mara plains descent will separate the wheat from the chaff. Organization appears solid with daily 08:30 starts, 19:00 cutoffs, and proper basecamp logistics, though missing key details like aid station spacing."
  },
  "experience": {
    "score": 5,
    "explanation": "Where else are you riding cattle tracks through wildebeest herds with potential elephant encounters on Stage 2? The Maasai Mara setting delivers untamed adventure that makes your local gravel race look like a parking lot crit. Four days of sleeping at Race HQ basecamp, crossing bridges at descent bases, and navigating thick black clay when it rains - this is bucket list territory."
  },
  "community": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Too new to have built the tight-knit community of established races, and the logistics barrier keeps field sizes manageable but not massive. No rider reviews or forum chatter in the data means the community story hasn't been written yet. The shared suffering of dodging motorbikes and jeeps while navigating savannah gravel will bond whoever shows up."
  },
  "field_depth": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "No data on field size or notable past winners because this thing barely exists yet - 2025 was the new course, 2026 is only the second edition. The expense and logistics of getting to Kenya naturally filter for serious riders, but pro participation unknown. The Zebra option keeps recreational riders from diluting the competitive field."
  },
  "value": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "International flights to Nairobi, accommodation, race entry, and the fact you need earliest departure June 21 means this is a week-long financial commitment. No entry fee data available but the full package deal with meals and basecamp accommodation isn't going to be cheap. You're paying for a once-in-a-lifetime experience, not local race value."
  },
  "expenses": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Kenya isn't cheap when you factor in international flights, race package, accommodation at Holiday Inn Two Rivers or City Lodge, and a week away from work. The remote Maasai Mara location means you're locked into their logistics - no budget options for camping or driving yourself. This is premium adventure racing with premium pricing."
  },
  "length": {
    "score": 5,
    "explanation": "650km over four stages is proper stage race distance that will test your endurance and recovery. Stage 4 alone is 181km with 1,980m of climbing through Loita Hills - that's a full day in the saddle. Four days of racing means accumulated fatigue becomes a real factor, especially when navigating technical descents and unpredictable weather."
  },
  "technicality": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "It's not technical in the rock garden sense - it's technical in the 'don't hit the elephant' sense. Wildlife trails, cattle tracks, and thick black clay when wet require different skills than your typical gravel race. Stage 2's technical descents and bridge crossings demand caution, but the real challenge is navigation and animal awareness, not bike handling."
  },
  "elevation": {
    "score": 4,
    "explanation": "8,000m over 650km averages out reasonable, but Stage 4's Loita Hills climb and the multi-stage format make it hurt more than the numbers suggest. Stage 3's 158km with 2,500m through savannah isn't flat cruising. The elevation comes in chunks that will test your climbing legs after multiple days of racing."
  },
  "climate": {
    "score": 5,
    "explanation": "June in the Maasai Mara is peak adventure - dry season but with unpredictable weather that can turn Stage 2 into thick black clay hell. You'll face windy shamba land on Stage 1 and variable conditions that add another layer of challenge. The climate isn't just weather, it's part of the race strategy."
  },
  "altitude": {
    "score": 4,
    "explanation": "Maasai Mara sits around 1,500-1,800m, so you'll feel it if you're coming from sea level but it won't destroy you like high-altitude races. The Loita Hills climb on Stage 4 pushes higher into proper altitude territory. Enough elevation to notice, not enough to require acclimatization weeks."
  },
  "logistics": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Flying into Nairobi, staying at Holiday Inn Two Rivers, then transport to Maasai Mara basecamp is straightforward but inflexible. Race HQ handles meals and accommodation, but you're locked into their schedule with bike build at 14:00 on Mara Day and 12:00 pack-up on June 20. International logistics always add complexity and stress."
  },
  "adventure": {
    "score": 5,
    "explanation": "This is peak adventure - riding through actual wilderness where you yield to elephants and navigate around wildebeest herds. Stage 2's wildlife encounters and forest exits through Maasai villages deliver genuine exploration, not manufactured adventure. Four days in the untamed Maasai Mara with nights at basecamp puts you properly off the grid."
