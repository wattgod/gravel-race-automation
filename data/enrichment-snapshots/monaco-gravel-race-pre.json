    "score": 5,
    "explanation": "UCI World Series qualifier status puts this race in the top tier of gravel events globally. Being one of only 45 races across 32 countries that can punch your ticket to World Championships carries serious weight. The Monaco location alone turns heads – this isn't some random farm loop, it's gravel racing in one of the world's most exclusive destinations."
  },
  "race_quality": {
    "score": 5,
    "explanation": "The course threading through Mercantour National Park delivers legitimate terrain with 8,202 feet of climbing over 68 miles. That's 121 feet per mile of consistent punishment through protected wilderness between sea and mountains. The 'many short, steep climbs' description means technical variety, not just mindless grinding."
  },
  "experience": {
    "score": 5,
    "explanation": "Racing gravel tracks through Mercantour National Park from Monaco is objectively unique – you won't find this combination anywhere else. The terrain between Mediterranean coastline and alpine peaks creates an adventure that transcends typical gravel racing. This is the kind of course that makes riders plan European vacations around race weekends."
  },
  "community": {
    "score": 4,
    "explanation": "UCI World Series events attract serious international fields, bringing together riders who've committed to chasing World Championship qualification. The logistics of reaching Monaco filter out casual participants, leaving a focused group of committed gravel racers. Limited research shows the community aspect, but the barrier to entry suggests quality over quantity."
  },
  "field_depth": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "No specific field size data available, but Monaco's location and costs likely limit participation compared to more accessible races. The UCI qualifier status draws international talent, but the expense and travel requirements probably thin the overall numbers. Quality field, but probably not the massive participation you'd see at major domestic events."
  },
  "value": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Racing in Monaco means paying Monaco prices for everything from accommodation to meals. The course delivers premium terrain through Mercantour National Park, but you're paying a luxury destination premium for 68 miles of gravel. Registration fees aren't published, but nothing about this location suggests budget-friendly."
  },
  "expenses": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Monaco ranks among the world's most expensive destinations – expect to pay accordingly. Accommodation, dining, and transportation costs will hit hard, especially during race weekend when demand peaks. International travel requirements for most participants add another expense layer that many gravel races don't carry."
  },
  "length": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "68 miles sits in the middle ground – substantial enough to hurt but not an epic endurance challenge. With 8,202 feet of climbing packed into those miles, the vertical load compensates for the moderate distance. It's a proper race length that respects riders' time while delivering sufficient suffering."
  },
  "technicality": {
    "score": 5,
    "explanation": "Gravel tracks through Mercantour National Park with 'many short, steep climbs' demands real bike handling skills. 8,202 feet of elevation gain over 68 miles means sustained technical climbing and descending through varied mountain terrain. This isn't fire road cruising – it's legitimate technical gravel racing that will expose weak bike handling."
  },
  "elevation": {
    "score": 5,
    "explanation": "8,202 feet over 68 miles delivers relentless vertical punishment at 121 feet per mile average. The course profile of 'many short, steep climbs' means repeated punchy efforts rather than steady grinding. Mercantour's mountain terrain between sea level and alpine peaks creates legitimate elevation challenges that define the race character."
  },
  "climate": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "April in the Mercantour region between Mediterranean coast and mountains creates variable conditions. Spring weather can swing from mild coastal influences to alpine conditions depending on elevation and exposure. No specific weather data available, but the geographic location suggests manageable but potentially unpredictable conditions."
  },
  "altitude": {
    "score": 1,
    "explanation": "Starting from Monaco at sea level means minimal altitude impact despite the 8,202 feet of climbing. The course climbs into foothills rather than true high-altitude terrain. Elevation gain is significant but altitude physiological effects remain minimal throughout the Mercantour park sections."
  },
  "logistics": {
    "score": 4,
    "explanation": "Monaco's compact size and infrastructure make race day logistics manageable once you arrive. Contact email (info@monacogravelrace.fr) suggests organized communication, and the established UCI calendar position indicates competent race management. The challenge lies in reaching Monaco and securing accommodation, not race day execution."
  },
  "adventure": {
    "score": 5,
    "explanation": "Gravel racing through Mercantour National Park from Monaco delivers genuine adventure you can't replicate elsewhere. The course connects Mediterranean coastline with protected alpine wilderness via technical gravel tracks. This transcends typical gravel racing into legitimate exploration of unique terrain that most riders will never experience outside this event."
