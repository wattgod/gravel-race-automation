    "explanation": "Fourteen years deep and they're calling themselves 'top 10 in North America' without any evidence to back that claim. Round 5 of the Oregon Triple Crown carries some regional weight, but 400 riders max means you're not exactly rubbing shoulders with cycling royalty. The organizers built this on '30 years of cycling adventure' but that translates to passionate locals, not national recognition."

    "explanation": "They've figured out the basics after 14 years—parade start through downtown Cottage Grove, timing stops 6 miles from finish, and optional early starts for the slower crowd. Registration caps at 400 so they're not overwhelmed by logistics nightmares. The 'quietest roads that cyclists will encounter' promise suggests they know their terrain, even if they can't be bothered to publish elevation profiles."

    "explanation": "Western Oregon's 'well kept secret' roads deliver the goods if you're into rural solitude over spectacle. Starting at Bohemia Park with that downtown parade roll-out gives you some ceremonial weight before hitting those quiet backroads. Three distance options means you can pick your pain level, though they're mysteriously vague about what that pain actually looks like course-wise."

    "explanation": "Dry camping at Bohemia Park creates that authentic suffer-together vibe, with fees going to youth fundraising instead of corporate pockets. The 20-space limit for vehicles under 20 feet keeps it intimate rather than turning into an RV convention. Day-of registration availability suggests they're flexible enough to accommodate the disorganized, which is more welcoming than most."

    "explanation": "Regional Oregon Triple Crown series draws the local hammers but doesn't pull serious talent from outside the Pacific Northwest. Four hundred rider cap in a state with limited cycling population means you're racing the same faces you see at every other Oregon event. No prize purse and zero mention of notable past winners confirms this isn't where careers get made."
  },
  "value": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Early registration at $130 with camping included is reasonable for what you get—62 miles through rural Oregon without the markup of destination events. The tandem option at $300 shows they're thinking beyond standard categories. Prices bump up in January but they give you a full year to lock in early pricing."
  },
  "expenses": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Cottage Grove keeps costs honest—camping spots at the start/finish eliminate hotel gouging, and being 20 minutes from Eugene means real airport access without resort pricing. Self-contained vehicles under 20 feet camp for basically nothing, with overflow at Swartz Campground for the oversized crowd. Continental and Pactimo kit available but not mandatory, keeping gear costs optional."

    "explanation": "The 100-mile Gran Fondo hits that sweet spot of serious without being stupid, while the 69-mile Medio gives mortals an out. Multiple distance options prevent the 'go big or go home' pressure that ruins so many events. Though they list 66 miles in Triple Crown materials—apparently even they can't agree on the actual distance."
  },
  "technicality": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "It's 100% road despite the 'Gran Fondo' name suggesting something more adventurous. Western Oregon's quiet backroads are smooth and predictable—great for pure fitness tests, less exciting for bike handling challenges. They promise 'cyclists paradise' roads, which usually means well-maintained pavement that won't destroy your equipment or your body."
  },
  "elevation": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "4,000 feet over 62 miles gives you legitimate climbing without the masochistic sufferfest of mountain events. That's enough vertical to separate the climbers from the diesel engines, but spread out enough that you won't be walking. No specific climb names mentioned, so expect rolling terrain rather than signature mountain passes."
  },
  "climate": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Mid-May in Western Oregon means you're gambling with spring weather—could be perfect 70-degree sunshine or cold rain that'll make you question your life choices. The 'well kept secret' roads they brag about become miserable when wet, and Oregon doesn't exactly have a reputation for reliable spring conditions. No weather data provided because they know it's a crapshoot."
  },
  "altitude": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Cottage Grove sits low enough that altitude isn't a factor for anyone living above sea level. Western Oregon's gentle elevation changes won't challenge your red blood cell count or require acclimatization strategies. The climbing comes from distance and gradient, not thin air—which is probably why they don't bother mentioning elevation anywhere in their marketing."
  },
  "logistics": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Twenty minutes from Eugene Airport with camping at the start/finish eliminates most travel headaches. Self check-in after noon Saturday and spaces for both tent and RV camping shows they've thought through arrival logistics. The 8:30 AM start with optional 8:00 AM early roll gives you flexibility, though early starters better be prepared to get passed when the real riders catch up."
  },
  "adventure": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Western Oregon backroads are scenic and quiet but hardly expedition territory—more Sunday club ride than epic adventure. The 'cyclists paradise' they promise is code for predictable pavement through farmland, not the type of terrain that generates stories worth telling. Camping at Bohemia Park adds some outdoor flavor, but you're still just doing a road ride that happens to start from a tent."
