    "explanation": "Race Director Corey Godfrey runs organized events with mandatory checkpoints, optional oases, and coordinated resupply points through small towns. The Pirate Cycling League has operated since 2007, evolving from 25 riders to established infrastructure. Ojai's 80-mile distance from LAX creates travel complications, but the organization demonstrates competence in managing field logistics and rider support systems."

  "length": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Colin Strickland overcame an early flat tire and still won his race, demonstrating the 65-mile distance allows recovery from mechanicals without eliminating competitive riders. The format mirrors successful mid-distance gravel events that separate casual participants from serious competitors. Alison Tetrick and Kae Takeshita's sprint finish shows the distance doesn't prevent tactical racing through to the line."
  },
  "technicality": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Ojai's mountain terrain naturally provides technical challenges through varied surfaces and sustained climbing. Without specific course details, assume typical Southern California gravel - fire roads mixed with singletrack sections. The elevation gain suggests technical demands regardless of surface composition."
  },
  "elevation": {
    "score": 4,
    "explanation": "6000 feet over 65 miles creates relentless climbing through Ojai's mountain terrain. Course profiles from similar Pirate Cycling League events show 8,000-11,000 feet over longer distances, suggesting comparable density here. Race Director notes that hills \"don't look challenging, but those hills are relentless. One after another after another.\" The elevation profile will leave competitive riders \"completely wasted at the finish.\""
  },
  "climate": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Ojai's coastal mountain climate avoids extreme temperature concerns while providing variable conditions. The potential for rain creates course challenges, as minimal maintenance roads become \"nearly-impassable mud bogs\" in wet conditions. Temperate Southern California weather supports year-round riding without the heat stress of desert events or cold-weather complications of northern races."
  },
  "altitude": {
    "score": 1,
    "explanation": "Ojai sits near sea level with climbs reaching moderate coastal range elevations. Zero altitude acclimatization required for any rider comfortable at normal elevations. Your cardiovascular system will work hard from the climbing effort and pace, not from thin air affecting oxygen delivery to working muscles."
  },
  "adventure": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Routes remain secret until race week, following the Pirate Cycling League tradition of exploration over familiarity. Course includes \"forgotten double-track wagon trails\" that challenge navigation and bike handling skills. The self-supported format forces interaction with rural communities and local businesses for resupply, creating authentic adventure elements beyond pure athletic competition."
  },
  "prestige": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The Pirate Cycling League brand carries grassroots credibility from organizing Gravel Worlds since 2007, attracting elite riders like Colin Strickland, Alison Tetrick, and Josh Berry. However, this specific Ojai event lacks the established reputation of their Nebraska flagship race. \"The level of competition and prestige of being a World Champion keeps Elite riders coming back\" to their main events, but this appears to be a smaller regional offering."
  },
  "race_quality": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Corey Godfrey's organization demonstrates competence through mandatory checkpoints, coordinated volunteer support, and structured field management from years running Gravel Worlds. The Pirate Cycling League follows \"nine basic rules\" with Rule #1 being \"Don't be lame,\" indicating informal but effective event control. Limited documentation for this specific Ojai race suggests smaller scale execution compared to their established Nebraska operation."
  },
  "experience": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Riders report transformative moments, with one noting \"My heart came alive out there\" during Pirate Cycling League events. The organization prioritizes experiences where riders \"dig deep and accomplish something they weren't sure they could do.\" Self-supported racing through Ojai's mountain terrain with mandatory community interaction creates memorable challenges beyond pure competition."
  },
  "community": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The Pirate Cycling League philosophy welcomes anyone: \"If you wanted to join the team or participate in an event, all you had to do was show up and ride.\" Organizers \"force riders to interact with volunteers and locals\" through resupply requirements, maintaining grassroots authenticity. Events create what one rider called \"Great miles with good friends and no bullshit\" community connections."
  },
  "field_depth": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "No established reputation means no established fast riders showing up. When serious competitors can't even find your race online, you're left with locals and the accidentally registered. Expect enthusiasm over expertise in the start corral."
  },
  "value": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Can't assess value without knowing registration costs, but invisible races typically charge modest fees for modest services. You're paying for course marking and maybe some snacks, not professional race production. Low expectations might actually work in your favor here."
  },
  "expenses": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "LAX sits 80 miles away, meaning rental car costs and gas to reach Ojai. No race-specific lodging partnerships means you're booking blind in a tourist town. Travel expenses will likely exceed registration fees by significant margins."
