    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Pisgah Productions bills this as the 'premiere all-road racing event in the region,' but that's regional fame at best. The Pisgah name carries weight among Southeast gravel nerds who know what 8,777 feet of climbing through Nantahala National Forest can do to your legs. Without notable winners or major media coverage in the search results, it's respected but not revered."

  "race_quality": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Three aid stations over 69.2 miles with neutral support and a generous 14-hour cutoff shows competent organization. Course marking with large orange arrows and downloadable GPX files covers the basics without flourishes. The logistics work, but there's nothing here that screams premium race production."
  },
  "experience": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "You get Pisgah's legendary terrain and Nantahala's scenery, which is genuinely spectacular. But the experience stops at the natural beauty – no mention of post-race festivities, live music, or memorable touches beyond a basic raffle drawing at 9PM. The mountains do the heavy lifting while the event itself stays workmanlike."
  },
  "community": {
    "score": 4,
    "explanation": "The Southeast gravel scene knows this race attracts riders who understand what 'brutal terrain' actually means. Starting from Davidson River Campground creates a natural gathering spot, and the Friday night packet pickup gives people time to swap war stories. These aren't tourists – they're locals and gravel devotees who chose this suffer-fest on purpose."
  },
  "field_depth": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "No data on field size or notable winners suggests a solid regional draw without national pull. At $152.50 entry, it filters out casual participants but doesn't command the prestige fees that attract sponsored teams. You're racing against committed Southeast gravel racers who know these roads, not a deep field of outsiders."
  },
  "value": {
    "score": 4,
    "explanation": "For $152.50, you get 69.2 miles of prime Pisgah terrain that would cost you a weekend of exploration to find on your own. Three stocked aid stations, neutral support, and 14 hours to suffer through some of the region's finest gravel roads. The mountains provide the value – the entry fee just gets you access and support."
  },
  "expenses": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Brevard offers basic lodging like Sunset Motel and Davidson River Campground without premium pricing. You're in small-town North Carolina, not Aspen, so accommodation costs stay reasonable. The main expense is getting to Pisgah Forest and whatever gear you need to survive 8,777 feet of climbing."
  },
  "length": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "69.2 miles falls short of the 100-mile benchmark that defines serious gravel endurance. While the climbing makes those miles harder than flat centuries, distance purists will finish wanting more. It's a solid day but not the epic length that separates weekend warriors from the truly committed."
  },
  "technicality": {
    "score": 5,
    "explanation": "This is Pisgah National Forest gravel – the kind that demands 'race tactics, fitness, gear selection, and luck' according to the race description. The route threading through forest service roads like 475b and 4663C requires technical handling skills and smart line choices. When organizers warn about gear selection being key to success, believe them."
  },
  "elevation": {
    "score": 5,
    "explanation": "8,777 feet of climbing over 69.2 miles averages 127 feet per mile – that's relentless. The route through Pisgah and Nantahala National Forests doesn't give you flat recovery sections. This elevation profile separates pretenders from the real mountain gravel racers who live for this punishment."
  },
  "climate": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Early September in the North Carolina mountains typically brings mild temperatures but unpredictable conditions. The forest canopy provides shade but also holds humidity, while elevation changes create microclimates. Without specific weather data, you're rolling dice on conditions that could range from perfect to miserable."
  },
  "altitude": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Starting near Davidson River Campground at roughly 2,500 feet and climbing through Pisgah terrain keeps you well below altitude concerns. Even the highest points won't challenge your oxygen intake. This is elevation gain pain, not altitude sickness territory."
  },
  "logistics": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Starting from a field across US276 from Davidson River Campground provides clear staging but basic amenities. Friday evening and Saturday morning packet pickup covers the bases without complexity. The logistics work for a regional event but don't include the convenience factors that make travel easy for outsiders."
  },
  "adventure": {
    "score": 5,
    "explanation": "Threading 69.2 miles through Pisgah and Nantahala National Forests on roads like Indian Creek and forest service routes delivers genuine backcountry adventure. The 14-hour cutoff and three aid stations mean you're largely self-sufficient through remote mountain terrain. This isn't a sanitized gravel experience – it's real mountain exploration with a number pinned on."
