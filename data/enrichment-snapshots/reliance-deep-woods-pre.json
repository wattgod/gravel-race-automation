    "explanation": "This is grassroots Tennessee gravel through and through—SORBA Chattanooga fundraiser with camping and beer, not UCI points. No notable past winners or pro field mentioned anywhere. It's a killer weekend in Cherokee National Forest that the locals love, but nobody's building their season around it."

  "race_quality": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "No course marking means you better download that GPX or you're lost in the Tennessee woods. Timing checkpoints at Buck Bald and Starr Mountain summits keep it legitimate, but the production values are clearly small-batch. When the research can't even pin down consistent distances or entry fees, you know what you're getting into."

  "experience": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Cherokee National Forest delivers the goods—8700 feet of climbing on the long route through terrain that's definitely not champagne gravel. Saturday's 72-mile beast hits Buck Bald and Starr Mountain while Sunday serves up rockier punishment. The \"beautiful country, great crowd, good times\" testimonial tells you everything about the vibe."

  "community": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Tennessee Gravel runs a proper grassroots weekend with camping, music, and beer at 155 Ellis Creek Road. SORBA Chattanooga gets the fundraising benefit while riders get that authentic gravel family feel. It's the kind of event where everyone knows each other by Sunday."
  },
  "field_depth": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Field size unknown, no pro presence mentioned, and it's a regional Tennessee affair in late April. The fact that they offer three different Saturday distances suggests they're accommodating recreational riders more than attracting elite competition. Grassroots means grassroots talent level."
  },
  "value": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Two-day stage race format with camping included gives you solid weekend bang for your buck. Cherokee National Forest access, aid stations at mountain summits, and that authentic Tennessee gravel community experience. Entry fees aren't published but the grassroots nature suggests reasonable pricing."
  },
  "expenses": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "East Tennessee location means driving for most people, and Reliance isn't exactly a major hub. Camping keeps lodging cheap if you're into that scene, but the remote Cherokee National Forest setting limits dining and convenience options. Budget for gas and pack your own food."
  },
  "length": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The 72-mile route with 8700 feet of climbing is a proper suffer-fest, while the 46-mile option gives you Buck Bald without total destruction. Sunday adds another 28 miles of rocky punishment if you're glutton enough. Multiple distance options let you choose your own adventure level."
  },
  "technicality": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Cherokee National Forest gravel that's \"not flat\" and \"not easy champagne gravel\" but still rideable on gravel bikes. Sunday's rockier terrain gets a hardtail recommendation for descents. It's challenging terrain without being full mountain bike technical—proper gravel difficulty."
  },
  "elevation": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "8700 feet over 72 miles puts real hurt on your legs, with mandatory checkpoints at Buck Bald and Starr Mountain summits. Even the short route serves up 5600 feet of climbing. Tennessee doesn't mess around when it comes to vertical gain."
  },
  "climate": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Late April in east Tennessee mountains hits that sweet spot—cool enough for big climbing efforts, warm enough that you won't freeze on descents. Spring weather can be unpredictable but beats summer heat or winter misery. No historical weather disasters mentioned in the research."
  },
  "altitude": {
    "score": 1,
    "explanation": "This is Tennessee, not Colorado. Cherokee National Forest elevations won't challenge your oxygen intake or require acclimatization. The climbing difficulty comes from gradient and distance, not thin air."
  },
  "logistics": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Single start location at 155 Ellis Creek Road with 7:30 AM roll-out keeps it simple. No course marking means download your GPX beforehand or get lost. Camping on-site eliminates lodging logistics, though that East Tennessee location means a drive for most riders."
  },
  "adventure": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Cherokee National Forest delivers legitimate wilderness gravel with no course marking—just you, your GPS, and Tennessee mountains. Camping under the stars with live music and beer after destroying yourself on Buck Bald and Starr Mountain. This is proper gravel adventure, not sanitized corporate racing."
