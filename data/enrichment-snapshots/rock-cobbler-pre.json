    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Peter Stetina called it 'the kookiest bike race I've ever done' - that's pro endorsement for weirdness, not prestige. Grew from 40 riders to global participants in 15 years, but it's still fundamentally Sam Ames' 'shit show' in Bakersfield. The gravel community knows it as a stellar adventure, but you're not winning UCI points or impressing sponsors here."
  },
  "race_quality": {
    "score": 4,
    "explanation": "Sam Ames delivers a meticulously crafted chaos - new routes every year, packet pickup with barrel racing and pasta, post-race party that runs 'until you finish and into the night.' They time you but declare 'ain't a race,' which is honest about what matters. The operational execution behind the madness is solid, even if the course includes ball pits and cattle dodging."
  },
  "experience": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Tim Adams came back for his 8th year of 'pain & suffering' - that tells you everything. You'll slip-slide down scree fields, carry your bike up 30% run-ups, and navigate WhiteClaw hand-ups in February. It's memorable as hell, but memorable doesn't always mean pleasant when you're dodging cattle in Bakersfield hills."
  },
  "community": {
    "score": 4,
    "explanation": "Fifteen years of Sam Ames building something genuinely unique, with riders coming back annually for punishment. The post-race scene includes beer, food, music, and raffle tickets that matter enough to penalize you for forgetting them. BMC sponsors it, Action Sports provides Friday support, and the whole thing feels like a family reunion for masochists."
  },
  "field_depth": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Stetina showed up, which means pros will test themselves here, but this isn't your typical racing circus. The 'unclassifiable' format and Bakersfield location filter out casual participants - you get committed gravel heads who want adventure over competition. Global participants doesn't mean fast participants, though the returning veterans like Tim Adams suggest serious riders stick around."
  },
  "value": {
    "score": 5,
    "explanation": "New course every year, pasta dinner, breakfast burritos, post-race party until dark, camping at venue for $50, and they call it a 'special gift' experience. Most events charge premium for half this package. You're getting 15 years of Sam Ames' creative suffering for whatever they're charging, plus the kind of stories you'll tell for years."
  },
  "expenses": {
    "score": 4,
    "explanation": "Vehicle camping is $50 per night at Pyles Boys Camp, which beats hotel rates in most places. Action Sports bike shop stays open Friday until 6:30pm for last-minute needs, so you won't get gouged on forgotten gear. Bakersfield isn't exactly a resort destination, so food and lodging stay reasonable compared to Sonoma or Marin county events."
  },
  "length": {
    "score": 4,
    "explanation": "The Cobbler hits 70-85 miles depending on Sam Ames' annual route creativity, with shorter Pebbler and longer Boulder options. At 100 miles it's a proper century with enough distance to hurt, but not the ego-crushing 200k+ that separates weekend warriors from the truly unhinged. Smart length for February fitness levels and unpredictable terrain."
  },
  "technicality": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Stetina described slip-sliding down scree fields and 30% run-ups that force hike-a-bikes - that's legitimate technical challenge. But it's not sustained singletrack or rock garden navigation; it's more about handling surprises and awkward surfaces. The 'puckering trails' and cattle dodging require bike handling, but it's adventure-technical rather than pure skill-technical."
  },
  "elevation": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "5000 feet over 100 miles averages 50 feet per mile - respectable climbing in Bakersfield's surrounding hills without being punitive. Those steep climbs hit hard enough to create the hike-a-bikes Stetina mentioned, but you're not grinding up sustained alpine passes. Enough elevation to hurt your legs without destroying your weekend."
  },
  "climate": {
    "score": 4,
    "explanation": "February in Bakersfield hits that sweet spot - lush green hills before California turns brown, cool enough to avoid valley heat, warm enough to avoid mountain snow. It's early-season racing weather that draws riders looking to test winter fitness. No mention of historical weather disasters, which in California means you probably won't get rained out."
  },
  "altitude": {
    "score": 1,
    "explanation": "Bakersfield sits at 400 feet above sea level, and even the surrounding hills don't push serious elevation. You'll get zero altitude training benefit and zero excuse for poor performance based on thin air. This is pure sea-level suffering, which means your cardiovascular system gets no breaks from physics."
  },
  "logistics": {
    "score": 4,
    "explanation": "Everything happens at Pyles Boys Camp - packet pickup Friday 2-8pm, camping on-site, start and finish in one location. Action Sports provides bike support until 6:30pm Friday, Covenant Coffee serves breakfast burritos Saturday morning. The new route secrecy until the week before is annoying, but otherwise Sam Ames has the operational details dialed after 15 years."
  },
  "adventure": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Peter Stetina called it 'unclassifiable' with ball pits, museum visits, and cattle dodging - that's legitimate adventure beyond normal gravel racing. Sam Ames changes the route annually and builds in genuine surprises that you can't train for. But it's still a day ride in Bakersfield, not a multi-day expedition or true wilderness experience."
