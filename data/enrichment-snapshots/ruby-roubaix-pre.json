    "score": 1,
    "explanation": "Packet pickup directions remain 'find the schoolhouse on race day.' No airport info, vague lodging suggestions to 'check out Elko,' zero parking details. The research data still reads like someone forgot to finish building the website."
  },
  "length": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The 62-mile main distance hits the gravel sweet spot, with riders warned that 'the final 20 miles can be the most grueling part of this ride.' The 120-mile Ruby Loop exists for masochists, while shorter options accommodate newer riders with E-bike categories available."
  },
  "technicality": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The Woods Lane section at mile 22 presents 'significant challenges' with 'large washouts and deep ruts' on loose dirt two-track. Harrison Pass features a 'twisting, often loose and wash-boarded descent,' but most terrain is described as well-maintained gravel roads."
  },
  "elevation": {
    "score": 4,
    "explanation": "The Lee Loop's 2,015 feet of gain is called 'deceptive' with 'most of the climbing on the return leg.' Even the Pleasant Valley Loop's 870 feet comes with warnings not to 'let the short distance fool you' due to rolling terrain difficulty."
  },
  "climate": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Late June timing coincides with wildflowers 'peaking over the summits' and potential water crossings 'depending on winter-spring snowpack.' Riders must manage hydration carefully, especially leaving Fort Halleck aid station 'with plenty of water' for the Fort Halleck-Lower Lamoille grind."
  },
  "altitude": {
    "score": 4,
    "explanation": "Lamoille sits at the base of the Ruby Mountains with riders climbing to Secret Pass summit through northern Nevada's high desert terrain. The elevation compounds the difficulty of those rolling hills and sustained climbs through mountain terrain."
  },
  "adventure": {
    "score": 4,
    "explanation": "The Ruby Valley Road section offers surprising variety: 'This section of gravel is well maintained, and often smoother than some of the pavement we are accustomed to riding.' Riders navigate 'vast expanses of lightly traveled roads' through spectacular Ruby Mountains backcountry rarely accessed by cyclists."
  },
  "prestige": {
    "score": 1,
    "explanation": "Six years old with 200 riders in 2025, organized by the Rotary Club of Elko Desert Sunrise as a fundraiser. No pro fields or coverage, but the charitable mission has funded youth leadership camps and $6,500 in scholarships through race proceeds."
  },
  "race_quality": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Fondo-style format lets riders 'race for the podium or ride at their own pace.' Silver State Race MedX joined in 2025 for medical support, but aid stations have only 'pumps, chain tools and limited hex wrenches' without trained mechanics."
  },
  "experience": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Riders must be prepared for self-sufficiency 'in the mountain bike race tradition' with mechanical repairs on their own. The final 18-mile grind features 'some of the roughest gravel of the route' over deceptive rolling hills that test preparation and pacing."
  },
  "community": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The Rotary Club connection delivers authentic local roots, with 2024 proceeds sponsoring six students for leadership camps and hosting an Italian exchange student. The fondo format creates camaraderie among the 200 riders who gather at the historic Lamoille School House."
  },
  "field_depth": {
    "score": 1,
    "explanation": "The strategic advice that 'many riders will bypass the first 2 or 3 aid stations if they're racing the course' suggests some competitive element, but E-bike categories and fondo format indicate recreational focus over racing depth."
  },
  "value": {
    "score": 4,
    "explanation": "Four distance options from 22 to 120 miles access Nevada's Ruby Mountains gravel network that most riders never see. Proceeds fund youth programs and scholarships, adding charitable value beyond the riding experience through Rotary Club community investment."
  },
  "expenses": {
    "score": 4,
    "explanation": "Lamoille, Nevada pricing remains modest with lodging strategy of 'check out Elko and surrounding area.' Remote location means minimal race weekend inflation, and riders need self-sufficiency tools but aid stations provide basic mechanical support to limit gear requirements."
