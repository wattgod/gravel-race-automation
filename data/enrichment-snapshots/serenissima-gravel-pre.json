    "explanation": "Created by ex-pro Filippo Pozzato in 2021 and attracts legitimate talent like Quinten Hermans who won in 2025 at a blistering 38 km/h average. But it's still finding its legs in the gravel hierarchy - four years isn't enough to build serious street cred. The Venice connection sounds glamorous until you realize most of the course runs through mundane Veneto countryside."

  "race_quality": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "When the race organizers can't even maintain consistent course details between editions, you know something's off. The 2021 version was 126.6km starting in Jesolo, the 2025 edition suddenly became 151.6km from an undisclosed location. That's not evolution, that's confusion masquerading as organization."
  },
  "experience": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Riding gravel through the Veneto region between major Italian classics has romantic appeal, especially with those three finishing laps around Piazzola sul Brenta. The 75% gravel ratio from the original edition shows they're serious about surface variety. Venice as a backdrop beats most race locations, even if you're not actually riding through the canals."
  },
  "community": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Pozzato's pro pedigree attracts serious riders, but the race hasn't developed the grassroots following that creates real community. No forum chatter, no Reddit threads, no rider reports - it's professionally run but culturally invisible. You'll race alongside quality cyclists who also can't find much intel about what they've signed up for."
  },
  "field_depth": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Hermans winning at pro-level speeds proves the front end has teeth, but we have zero data on field size or overall competitive depth. A race that can't publish basic participation numbers either has something to hide or nothing worth bragging about. Quality at the top doesn't equal depth throughout the field."
  },
  "value": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Without published entry fees, we're flying blind on actual value proposition. But racing 150+ kilometers of Italian gravel with professional organization and Veneto's cycling infrastructure typically delivers solid bang for your euro. The lack of transparent pricing suggests they're not confident enough in their value to advertise it."
  },
  "expenses": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Venice proximity means tourist-trap pricing for everything from hotels to pasta. You're paying premium rates to stay near one of Europe's most expensive cities, then driving out to farm country to actually race. The Veneto region offers better value than Venice proper, but location logistics will drain your wallet."
  },
  "length": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The 65-mile distance sits in that sweet spot - long enough to hurt, short enough to leave you wanting more. Hermans' sub-4-hour winning time suggests the course flows well without soul-crushing technical sections that destroy pacing. It's proper gravel distance without the masochistic tendencies of 200+ kilometer sufferfests."
  },
  "technicality": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Veneto's gentle agricultural terrain doesn't offer much in the way of technical challenges - this isn't Tuscany with its steep gravel climbs. The 75% gravel percentage sounds impressive until you realize it's probably well-maintained farm roads rather than sketchy singletrack. Expect grinding, not picking lines through rock gardens."
  },
  "elevation": {
    "score": 1,
    "explanation": "2000 feet over 65 miles is practically pancake flat - that's what you get racing through the Po Valley agricultural region. The Veneto countryside between Venice and Padova offers about as much vertical challenge as a Kansas corn field. If you're seeking climbing, you've chosen the wrong Italian region."
  },
  "climate": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Mid-October in Northern Italy typically delivers ideal gravel conditions - cool enough to suffer without overheating, warm enough to avoid frozen fingers. The Po Valley can get soggy, but late autumn usually means stable weather before winter sets in. Just pray the Adriatic doesn't send rain inland during your race weekend."
  },
  "altitude": {
    "score": 1,
    "explanation": "Starting near sea level in the Venice lagoon area and staying in the Po Valley means altitude is never a factor. You're racing at essentially the same elevation as the Adriatic Sea throughout the entire course. Your legs will hurt from effort, not oxygen debt."
  },
  "logistics": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Venice Marco Polo Airport provides international access, and Italian cycling infrastructure is generally solid for gear and support. But when race organizers can't publish basic details like start locations or packet pickup info, you're left guessing about crucial logistics. The bones are there - Venice connectivity, Italian cycling culture - but execution details remain mysteriously absent."
  },
  "adventure": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Racing gravel through historic Veneto countryside offers genuine cultural immersion beyond just pedaling hard. The Sile and Treviso-Ostiglia bike routes showcase real Italian cycling heritage, not manufactured adventure tourism. Finishing in Piazzola sul Brenta beats most industrial park criteriums, even if the course lacks serious geographical drama."
