    "explanation": "Venice Marco Polo Airport provides international access, and Italian cycling infrastructure supports the event well. Winner Lutsenko called it \"an unforgettable experience,\" suggesting solid operational execution. The race runs smoothly from Jesolo through the Parco Naturale Regionale del Fiume Sile to finish in Cittadella's winding streets."

  "length": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Lutsenko's winning attack came with 80km remaining in the 132km race, soloing to victory in 3.5 hours of what he described as \"100 percent full gas.\" The distance allows for tactical racing without becoming a pure endurance slog, as evidenced by the late-race moves that defined the outcome."
  },
  "technicality": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Lutsenko described \"very narrow roads and so many corners\" on the technical parcours. With only 25% paved surfaces and 110km of off-road routes, the course features single-track through Parco Naturale Regionale del Fiume Sile, though riders noted \"few wide-open stretches of stones like those found in races Stateside.\""
  },
  "elevation": {
    "score": 1,
    "explanation": "The Po Valley terrain between Jesolo and Cittadella offers minimal vertical challenge, staying near sea level throughout. The 2000 feet over 65 miles reflects the gentle agricultural landscape of the Veneto region, where tactical positioning matters more than climbing power."
  },
  "climate": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Mid-October in Northern Italy typically delivers ideal gravel conditions - cool enough to suffer without overheating, warm enough to avoid frozen fingers. The Po Valley can get soggy, but late autumn usually means stable weather before winter sets in."
  },
  "altitude": {
    "score": 1,
    "explanation": "Starting near sea level in Jesolo and finishing in Cittadella means altitude never becomes a factor. The entire route through the Po Valley maintains essentially the same elevation as the nearby Adriatic Sea."
  },
  "adventure": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The race philosophy \"La Serenissima Gravel è nata per chi ama uscire dalle regole ordinarie e buttarsi nell'avventura\" captures the spirit perfectly. Racing through Treviso entirely on gravel roads and finishing in \"the spectacular setting of magnificent Cittadella\" delivers cultural immersion beyond typical gravel events."
  },
  "prestige": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "As \"the first-ever pro-only gravel event on the calendar,\" created by Milano-Sanremo winner Filippo Pozzato, the race attracts WorldTour talent like Lutsenko and Hermans. However, four years since its 2021 founding isn't enough time to build serious hierarchy credentials in the gravel world."
  },
  "race_quality": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The unique format strips away team support - \"no radios, no team cars, only limited mechanical assistance\" - forcing pure racing instincts. Sports director Martinelli called it \"a new but so nice race which must go on,\" though organizational consistency between editions remains questionable."
  },
  "experience": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Lutsenko's description of racing without team communication - \"just like that I chose my tactic: Alexey, go as fast as you can\" - captures the raw, self-reliant experience. The stripped-down format creates \"a feeling that I hadn't felt in a long time\" according to the winner."
  },
  "community": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The race features \"no radios, minimal technical assistance, just you, your bike and the road ahead\" philosophy that attracts both professionals and enthusiasts. Part of Pozzato's \"Ride the Wonderland\" series, it aims to create a \"stadium atmosphere\" where spectators can see multiple race stages."
  },
  "field_depth": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "WorldTour teams like Astana-Premier Tech, Cofidis, and Alpecin-Deceuninck bring serious depth to the front of the race. Hermans won the 2025 edition in his final race for the team, while Minali celebrated a podium finish, showing competitive racing throughout the field."
  },
  "value": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The pro-only format with WorldTour participation and unique no-radio regulations creates a distinctive racing experience. As part of the broader \"Ride the Wonderland\" series with hospitality packages, the event delivers professional-level organization in the historic Veneto region."
  },
  "expenses": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Venice proximity means tourist-trap pricing for accommodations and meals. You're paying premium rates to stay near one of Europe's most expensive cities, then traveling to the Veneto countryside for the actual race, which inflates the overall weekend cost."
