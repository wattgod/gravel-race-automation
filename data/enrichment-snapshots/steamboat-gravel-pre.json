    "explanation": "Yampa Valley Regional Airport offers direct flights from 12 cities, and Denver is a 3-hour drive. Registration sells out via lottery with no race day packet pickup. Ben Brown describes early morning challenges: \"The first hour was fucked... you had to go crazy hard just to stay with the group\" as riders navigate altitude adjustment and aggressive pacing from the gun."
  },
  "length": {
    "score": 4,
    "explanation": "Black course at 108 miles demands serious strategy and fitness. Ben Delaney on the Blue course noted \"there was still 100 miles to go\" at mile 40, while Bruce Lin planned to \"reduce aid station stops to a single stop at Aid 4 (mile 95)\" to maintain his target pace of 18 mph over the full distance. Longer than Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."
  },
  "technicality": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Mixed terrain includes the famous champagne gravel plus technical challenges. Ben Brown encountered \"an impromptu bit of CX\" through hay fields and \"thick, loose gravel on a downhill... like riding through sand... except you're going like 40mph.\" Bruce Lin crashed on a \"steep and twisty descent\" with \"loose and bumpy\" surface conditions. Similar technical demands to Gravel Worlds."
  },
  "elevation": {
    "score": 4,
    "explanation": "The 8,189 feet of climbing includes serious sustained efforts. Ben Brown described the mile 40 climb as \"a 4-mile, 9%, gravel situation that goes from 6.5k to around 9.5k.\" Ben Delaney averaged 356w normalized power for 11.5 minutes on the Steamboat Lake climb, calling it where \"a critical selection was made.\" More climbing than Gravel Locos at the same score."
  },
  "climate": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Late June in the Colorado Rockies means variable conditions - cool mornings, warm afternoons, and the ever-present threat of afternoon thunderstorms. Not extreme, but requires preparation. Similar climate challenges to Lost and Found Gravel."
  },
  "altitude": {
    "score": 4,
    "explanation": "Starting at 6,700 feet and climbing to ~8,500 feet puts this firmly in high-altitude territory. Riders from sea level will feel the thin air significantly - acclimatization is strongly recommended. Higher altitude racing, comparable to Atlas Mountain Race."
  },
  "adventure": {
    "score": 5,
    "explanation": "The route through working ranches and Rocky Mountain terrain delivers bucket-list scenery. Micah Ling describes the sensory experience: \"Steamboat Springs, Colorado smells amazing... hills surrounding the area are packed with sage and fields are dotted with fresh bales of sweet hay.\" The Oak Creek loop and champagne gravel roads create an iconic gravel pilgrimage."
  },
  "prestige": {
    "score": 5,
    "explanation": "One of the crown jewels of gravel cycling. Independent event founded by Amy Charity in 2019, attracts world-class pros (Keegan Swenson's three-peat, Lauren De Crescenzo, Lauren Stephens) despite not being part of any major series. Iconic status on its own merit."
  },
  "race_quality": {
    "score": 5,
    "explanation": "Professional production includes rolling enclosure, five well-stocked aid stations, and multi-day expo. Micah Ling praised the execution: \"I can't say enough about the aid stations. The sponsors were awesome, the volunteers were awesome, the food/drink selection was awesome.\" Organizers provide detailed course warnings about challenging sections like loose gravel descents."
  },
  "experience": {
    "score": 5,
    "explanation": "From Yampa Street staging through champagne gravel to the Zipp Cow Creek finish, riders encounter life-changing terrain. Micah Ling captured the progression: \"By mile-85, I was having the time of my life... maybe I was heat-delirious, or just happy that I was feeling so good, but the second-half seemed even better than the first.\""

  "community": {
    "score": 5,
    "explanation": "Founded with equal prize money and strong inclusivity focus. Peter Abraham noted unprecedented diversity: \"more riders of color present than at any bike race I've been to in my 40 years in the sport.\" Micah Ling observed the supportive atmosphere: \"just around each bend there was someone encouraging racers\" throughout the remote ranch country."

  "field_depth": {
    "score": 5,
    "explanation": "Despite not being an major series event, the prestige attracts world-class pros. Keegan Swenson, Lauren Stephens, Lauren De Crescenzo, and top gravel racers compete here. Strong prize purse and iconic status draw elite fields. Elite-level competition, on par with Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego. As Ben Brown puts it: \"After the first gravel sector, which lasts about 30 miles, we came out onto the tarmac for a short while before cutting back through a hay field for an impromptu bit of CX.\""

  "value": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "At $275 for most courses, it's premium pricing for a premium event. You get Life Time-level production value, excellent aid stations, and a outstanding experience, but it's definitely not budget-friendly."
  },
  "expenses": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Total costs escalate quickly between remote location travel, resort town lodging, and premium registration fees. Flights to Yampa Valley or Denver drives plus summer Steamboat Springs accommodation rates create significant barriers. The destination nature and lottery system mean substantial financial commitment with no guarantee of entry, pushing total trip costs toward $1,500+ from most locations. Higher total cost than Badlands."
