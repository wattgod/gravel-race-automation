  "prestige": {
    "score": 5,
    "explanation": "One of the crown jewels of gravel cycling. Independent event founded by Amy Charity in 2019, attracts world-class pros (Keegan Swenson's three-peat, Lauren De Crescenzo, Lauren Stephens) despite not being part of any major series. Iconic status on its own merit."
  },
  "race_quality": {
    "score": 5,
    "explanation": "Elite-level organization with professional race production, rolling enclosure for the Black course, 5 well-stocked aid stations, separate elite starts, and a multi-day expo experience. World-class in every detail."
  },
  "experience": {
    "score": 5,
    "explanation": "Life-changing territory. From packet pickup on Yampa Street to the champagne gravel roads through working ranches, the Zipp Cow Creek finish, and the post-race celebration in one of Colorado's best mountain towns - this is what gravel dreams are made of."
  },
  "community": {
    "score": 5,
    "explanation": "Founded with equal prize money from day one, strong emphasis on respect for local ranching community, inclusive with para-cycling resources and e-bike options. The vibe is welcoming and the gravel tribe comes out in force - 2,750 riders strong."
  },
  "field_depth": {
    "score": 5,
    "explanation": "Despite not being an major series event, the prestige attracts world-class pros. Keegan Swenson, Lauren Stephens, Lauren De Crescenzo, and top gravel racers compete here. Strong prize purse and iconic status draw elite fields."
  },
  "value": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "At $275 for most courses, it's premium pricing for a premium event. You get Life Time-level production value, excellent aid stations, and a world-class experience, but it's definitely not budget-friendly."
  },
  "expenses": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Total trip costs add up quickly - flights to remote Yampa Valley or 3-hour drive from Denver, lodging in a ski resort town during summer, and the registration fees. Expect $1,000-1,500+ for the full experience from most locations."
  },
  "length": {
    "score": 4,
    "explanation": "Black course at 108 miles puts this firmly in the 100-150 mile category. Substantial distance that demands fitness and strategy, though not ultra-distance territory."
  },
  "technicality": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The famous 'champagne gravel' is actually quite smooth and fast, with mixed terrain including some rougher sections and descents. Technical enough to keep you honest, but not extreme singletrack territory."
  },
  "elevation": {
    "score": 4,
    "explanation": "8,189 feet of climbing on the Black course is serious vertical. Multiple significant climbs including Dunkley Pass demand climbing legs and smart pacing throughout the day."
  },
  "climate": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Late June in the Colorado Rockies means variable conditions - cool mornings, warm afternoons, and the ever-present threat of afternoon thunderstorms. Not extreme, but requires preparation."
  },
  "altitude": {
    "score": 4,
    "explanation": "Starting at 6,700 feet and climbing to ~8,500 feet puts this firmly in high-altitude territory. Riders from sea level will feel the thin air significantly - acclimatization is strongly recommended."
  },
  "logistics": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Yampa Valley Regional Airport offers direct flights from 12 cities, and Denver is a 3-hour drive. Steamboat has good lodging options, but it's still a destination requiring planning and the event sells out via lottery."
  },
  "adventure": {
    "score": 5,
    "explanation": "This is bucket-list territory. World-renowned champagne gravel through stunning Colorado ranch country, aspen groves, and mountain vistas. The scenery alone makes this a must-do pilgrimage for serious gravel riders."
