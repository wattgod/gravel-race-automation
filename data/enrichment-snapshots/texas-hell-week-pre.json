    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Fredericksburg location about 80 miles from Austin-Bergstrom provides reasonable access, but specific lodging and parking details remain vague despite 300+ annual participants. The rbent forum shows riders coordinating rooming arrangements themselves, with bikerteam noting his 50+ trips to Fredericksburg for the event."
  },
  "length": {
    "score": 4,
    "explanation": "Seven days of riding with daily A/B/C options from 30-107 miles creates serious volume for committed riders. Bikerteam planned to \"ride the A or B ride every day, with the exception of Monday, where I'll ride the 200k,\" while aikigreg scaled back due to \"lack of current conditioning and base miles.\""
  },
  "technicality": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Camp Wood Loop features \"steep climbs and river crossings\" with four major climbs dropping into Medina, Sabinal, Frio, and Nueces River valleys. The Spicewood Loop includes \"a short unpaved section\" and numerous water crossings on the Edwards Plateau, but nothing approaching technical singletrack challenge."
  },
  "elevation": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Hill Country terrain delivers consistent climbing with Camp Wood Loop hitting 54 ft/mile elevation gain through river valley crossings. FlyingLaZBoy considered \"something a bit lighter\" than his steel recumbent, ultimately \"chugging up those Fredericksburg mountains on the SXP\" instead."
  },
  "climate": {
    "score": 1,
    "explanation": "Mid-March Texas Hill Country weather remains unpredictable despite wildflower season timing. The 2008 \"long term forecast shows temps to be in the 80's\" according to bikerteam's planning notes, but mornings can be foggy with afternoon clearing creating variable daily conditions."
  },
  "altitude": {
    "score": 1,
    "explanation": "Starting around Fredericksburg at roughly 1,700 feet with Edwards Plateau elevations, this presents zero altitude considerations for cycling performance. All physiological limitations will stem from fitness and heat rather than oxygen availability at these Hill Country elevations."
  },
  "adventure": {
    "score": 4,
    "explanation": "Seven days exploring Texas Hill Country ranch roads through multiple river valleys with routes like the Leakey Death Ride creates sustained adventure potential. The Crabapple Loop offers \"the Hill Country at its best\" with cattle guards, water crossings, and no gas stations for miles."
  },
  "prestige": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Founded by West Texas A&M professor Nick Gerlich in 1994 as an informal training camp, this grew to attract 300+ riders annually before its 2017 hiatus. Participants \"were devastated\" when it ended, but it remains a riding camp rather than a competitive race with notable winners."
  },
  "race_quality": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "This is explicitly a training camp where Upper Midwest cyclists \"ride themselves into shape by logging as many miles as they could in a week\" after winter. No timing, no competition, just supported group rides with optional seminars on coaching and nutrition."
  },
  "experience": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Multi-day format through varying Hill Country terrain from Edwards Plateau farms to river valley crossings creates solid riding variety. The revival by the Boethlings added educational seminars and maintains the social atmosphere, though bikerteam's \"5th Hell Week\" suggests strong repeat appeal."
  },
  "community": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Draws 300+ riders annually with camp-like atmosphere including evening seminars and social events. The rbent forum shows dedicated community coordination with riders planning room shares and multi-year attendance, though it's more cycling vacation than competitive racing tribe."
  },
  "field_depth": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "With daily A/B/C route options and no timing, participants self-select based on current fitness rather than competitive performance. Aikigreg's concern about \"lack of current conditioning\" making longer routes inadvisable reflects the recreational rather than racing field composition."
  },
  "value": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Early registration at $160 for a week of supported rides, seminars, and social events provides reasonable value for a training camp format. The 25% discount for RAAM qualifier participants and multi-day supported riding makes the math work for serious mileage accumulation."
  },
  "expenses": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Fredericksburg location in Hill Country offers reasonable lodging costs with 100+ restaurants and extensive accommodation options according to organizers. Competitive recumbent riders coordinated their own rooming arrangements through online forums, suggesting manageable total costs for the week-long format."
