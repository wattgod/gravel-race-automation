    "explanation": "Official Missouri State Championship status gives it credibility in the gravel world. But let's be honest—it's still Missouri gravel, not Unbound Kansas or Belgian Waffle Ride. The 200-300 rider field keeps it intimate but doesn't generate the buzz of the marquee events."

  "race_quality": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Missouri Gravel Events runs a solid operation with multiple aid stations and proper logistics at the Marthasville Community Center. The 85% gravel, 15% pavement split shows thoughtful route design through wine country. Nothing fancy, nothing broken—just competent race management in the middle of America."

  "experience": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Rolling through Missouri River Valley wine country is beautiful, with the Katy Trail crossing adding historic flavor. But late July heat (85-95°F with 70-85% humidity) turns the second half into a survival march. The scenery's nice until you're dying from heat exhaustion at mile 60."

  "community": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "State championship draws Missouri's competitive gravel racers but maintains that Midwest friendly vibe. The emerging Missouri gravel scene means you'll meet passionate locals building something real. Field size of 200-300 keeps it personal—you'll actually talk to people instead of getting lost in a cattle drive."
  },
  "field_depth": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "State championship status attracts Missouri's fastest gravel riders, so the pointy end has speed. But with only 200-300 total riders, you're not getting the depth of talent you'd see at bigger events. Solid local competition wrapped in a mostly recreational field."
  },
  "value": {
    "score": 4,
    "explanation": "Registration at $85-$110 for a state championship with proper support is fair money. You get 100 miles of well-marked Missouri gravel, multiple aid stations, and official state championship recognition. No gouging, no bullshit fees—just honest pricing for what you're getting."
  },
  "expenses": {
    "score": 4,
    "explanation": "Marthasville keeps costs reasonable with limited but affordable local lodging options. St. Charles is 20 miles away with more hotel choices if you need them. STL airport is an hour drive, and Missouri doesn't rape you on gas or food like coastal states."
  },
  "length": {
    "score": 4,
    "explanation": "100 miles hits the gravel sweet spot—long enough to separate pretenders from finishers, short enough to not become an ultraendurance death march. The distance respects your weekend while still demanding proper fitness and pacing strategy."
  },
  "technicality": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Reddit consensus says 38mm tires are fine because 'Missouri gravel is smooth compared to mountain states.' It's county road gravel—maintained, predictable, nothing that'll break your bike or bones. Technical challenge comes from heat management, not bike handling."
  },
  "elevation": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "5,000 feet over 100 miles means constant Missouri River Valley rollers with no recovery. Not one monster climb you can survive—just relentless ups and downs that grind you down. The kind of elevation that sneaks up and destroys your legs by mile 80."
  },
  "climate": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Late July in Missouri is a heat death sentence—90-95°F with crushing humidity pushing heat index over 100°F. 2023 saw 20% DNF from extreme heat, 2024 hit 15% DNF. This isn't racing, it's heat stroke roulette with some cycling thrown in."
  },
  "altitude": {
    "score": 1,
    "explanation": "Marthasville sits in the Missouri River Valley at basically sea level. Zero altitude considerations unless you count the slight elevation change from your couch to the start line. Your biggest respiratory challenge will be the oppressive humidity, not thin air."
  },
  "logistics": {
    "score": 4,
    "explanation": "Marthasville Community Center provides solid race HQ with parking handled. STL airport is a reasonable hour drive, and packet pickup runs both day-before and race morning. Small town logistics work in your favor—everything's close, nothing's complicated."
  },
  "adventure": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Missouri wine country roads through the River Valley offer scenic beauty and the Katy Trail crossing adds historical texture. But it's still Missouri county roads, not epic mountain passes or desert wastelands. Pretty countryside that won't change your life or Instagram engagement."
