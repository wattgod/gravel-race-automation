    "explanation": "The complete gravel experience. Start in darkness with 800 riders' taillights winding up the hill. Race through Catalan countryside, coast, and mountains. Finish in Girona's cycling-obsessed atmosphere. The 'party peloton' grupettos at 2 AM. Unforgettable."

    "score": 4,
    "explanation": "Girona is cycling's spiritual home in Europe. 1,900+ riders from 65+ countries. The shared suffering creates bonds—especially in the overnight hours. The festival atmosphere continues days around the race. 35%+ of field is female."

    "score": 5,
    "explanation": "The strongest gravel field in Europe. WorldTour names (Lachlan Morton, Ted King, Pete Stetina), gravel specialists (De Marchi, Migon), ultra legends (Sehili, Wilcox). 'The level of riders is insane.' Racing at the front is full pro sport."

    "explanation": "~150-200 EUR for 360K is reasonable for an event of this caliber. You get world-class organization and Europe's premier gravel race. Worth the investment."

  "expenses": {
    "score": 4,
    "explanation": "Girona is affordable by European standards—not Paris or London pricing. Barcelona flights are cheap. Many good hotel options. Budget for a multi-day gravel festival trip."
  },
  "logistics": {
    "score": 4,
    "explanation": "Girona is a cycling mecca with solid infrastructure, but getting there requires connecting through Barcelona or Madrid for most international riders. Registration sells out in minutes when it opens in July - miss that window and you're hunting overpriced tour packages or hoping for cancellations. The race provides live tracking, multiple feed zones, and professional media coverage, but you're still responsible for mandatory GPS navigation since the course isn't fully marked. It's well-organized chaos, not seamless convenience."
  },
  "length": {
    "score": 5,
    "explanation": "At 360 kilometers, this sits in the sweet spot of suffering - long enough to break you physically and mentally, short enough to finish in one brutal day. The 32-hour cutoff sounds generous until you're grinding through technical singletrack at 3 AM with dead legs. Winners like Peter Stetina average 30 km/h over this terrain, which tells you everything about how the back half eats people alive. This distance separates weekend warriors from legitimate gravel racers."
  },
  "technicality": {
    "score": 4,
    "explanation": "The course throws everything at you - smooth hardpack that lulls you into false confidence, then rocky climbs and loose descents that punish poor bike handling. About 15% is singletrack trail mixed with 80% varied gravel surfaces, meaning you're constantly adjusting technique. The immediate paved climb out of Girona thins the field before narrow gravel sections sort riders by skill level. It's not Leadville-technical, but it'll expose every weakness in your handling."
  },
  "elevation": {
    "score": 4,
    "explanation": "The 3,700m of climbing hits you in waves - starting with an immediate 300m paved climb out of Girona at dawn, then rolling terrain that gradually wears you down. It's not one monster climb that defines the race, but relentless undulation through Catalonia's varied landscape. The elevation profile creates tactical racing rather than pure climbing - you can't just time trial up one big mountain and coast to the finish. Smart pacing on these rolling climbs separates podium contenders from the suffering masses."
  },
  "climate": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Late April in Catalonia means you're gambling with weather - it could be perfect 20°C sunshine or the kind of conditions that forced organizers to cancel the 560K mid-race in 2024. The Mediterranean influence keeps it from being brutal, but spring weather is unpredictable enough to demand preparation for everything. Starting at dawn means cold early kilometers before potentially hot afternoon suffering. Pack layers and pray the weather gods cooperate."
  },
  "altitude": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Starting from sea level in Girona means altitude isn't a factor here - your lungs will work fine, your legs are the problem. The coastal plains and rolling hills of Catalonia keep you well below any altitude that matters physiologically. If you're suffering to breathe at these elevations, gravel racing isn't your issue. This is pure power and endurance, not thin air adaptation."
  },
  "adventure": {
    "score": 5,
    "explanation": "This race earned the nickname 'Europe's Unbound' for good reason - 1,900 riders from 65+ countries converging on Girona creates an electric atmosphere that transcends typical racing. The course delivers everything from medieval villages to coastal views to technical forest singletrack in one loop. Starting at dawn with a string of red taillights climbing out of the cycling capital of Europe feels like joining something legendary. When WorldTour pros and weekend warriors line up together for 32 hours of potential suffering, you know you've found something special."
