  "prestige": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "42 editions makes this a Texas institution, but calling yourself 'THE classic Midsummer Texas Ride' doesn't make it nationally relevant. It sells out, which means local demand, but zero mention of pro fields or serious racing pedigree in the search results. Regional respect, not gravel scene credibility."
  },
  "race_quality": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Multiple distance options and a 1:00 p.m. course closure show basic organization, but the 10:45 a.m. cutoff at 40 miles is generous enough to question the challenge level. No details on course marking, aid station quality, or rider feedback in the research. Functional, not exceptional."
  },
  "experience": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Riding through centuries-old live oaks at Buffalo Gap and tackling the Callahan Divide hills creates legitimate atmosphere. Three distance options let riders pick their suffering level, and the small-town Texas vibe has charm. The breakfast vendor and zoo weekend package show they're thinking beyond just the bike race."
  },
  "community": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Four decades of continuous operation proves local buy-in, and selling out the 2025 edition shows people keep coming back. Friday packet pickup at Biketown and benefiting local nonprofits like PMCM demonstrates community integration. Not flashy, but authentic small-town cycling culture."
  },
  "field_depth": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Sold-out field suggests good participation numbers, but zero mention of competitive depth or notable winners in the research. The generous cutoff times and multiple shorter distances indicate this leans recreational over racing. Local heroes, not national talent."
  },
  "value": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "No entry fees listed in research, but a 42-year-old Texas event that sells out probably prices fairly for what it delivers. Multiple distance options and the breakfast vendor add perceived value. Without specific pricing data, the longevity and sellout status suggest reasonable cost-to-experience ratio."
  },
  "expenses": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Buffalo Gap sits 13 miles from Abilene, so lodging and travel costs should be manageable for a Texas location. No specific expense details in research, but small-town Texas typically means reasonable food and accommodation prices. The zoo weekend package suggests affordable family options."
  },
  "length": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The 100K option at 62 miles hits the sweet spot for serious gravel distance without being epic. Multiple options including 50K and 11-mile routes let different riders find their challenge level. Not groundbreaking distance, but properly sized for the audience."
  },
  "technicality": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The Callahan Divide hills and rural Texas roads suggest some legitimate challenge, but the research lacks specific terrain details or technical difficulty ratings. No mention of gnarly descents, technical sections, or surface composition breakdowns. Probably rolling hills, not rock gardens."
  },
  "elevation": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The Callahan Divide provides 'challenging hills' according to race marketing, but no specific elevation gain numbers in the research. Central Texas topography suggests meaningful but not mountainous climbing. Without hard data, this is educated guessing based on geography."
  },
  "climate": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Late July in central Texas means guaranteed heat and humidity that will test riders harder than any climb. The 7:30 a.m. start time acknowledges the brutal summer conditions, but you're still racing in Texas summer. Surviving the weather becomes part of the challenge."
  },
  "altitude": {
    "score": 1,
    "explanation": "Central Texas means basically sea level elevation with zero altitude impact on performance. Buffalo Gap area sits in typical Texas hill country elevation that won't affect anyone's breathing. Altitude is completely irrelevant to this race experience."
  },
  "logistics": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Friday packet pickup at Biketown and day-of registration starting at 6:15 a.m. show basic organization, but no details on parking, specific lodging, or airport logistics in the research. Multiple start times for different distances demonstrates planning, but Buffalo Gap's small size likely creates infrastructure limitations."
  },
  "adventure": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "Centuries-old live oaks and rural Texas roads through the Callahan Divide create some scenic character, but this reads more like organized touring than true adventure. The multiple bailout options and generous cutoffs suggest safety over exploration. Pleasant countryside, not wilderness expedition."
