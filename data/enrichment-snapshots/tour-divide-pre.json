    "explanation": "Complete self-sufficiency across 2,745 miles. No outside assistance permitted. Resupply only at commercial establishments in ~20 towns spaced 100-200 miles apart. Mac Tyler Fox describes it as \"possibly the stupidest, most awesome thing I've done to date, and I loved it as much as I hated it.\" Must carry days of food and water for sections like the Great Basin (100+ miles, no natural water). True expedition logistics for 2-4 weeks."

    "explanation": "Brett Simpson finished in 20 days 21 hours, averaging 137 miles per day: \"My goal was 22 days with a secret goal of 19 days. Due to forest fires we were re-routed and added 115 miles to our route.\" The 2,745-mile distance is beyond ultra-endurance—it's expedition territory. Current record is 13 days, 2 hours (Justinas Leveika, 2024). This is not a race; it's a way of life for 2-4 weeks. Among the longest in gravel, comparable to Badlands."

  "technicality": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "OneOfSeven Rider describes day one conditions: \"The conditions ranged from beautiful crushed gravel paths to muddy single track, back to muddy logging roads and finally a very rocky Hike-a-Bike (HAB) up Koko Pass.\" Despite epic scale, technical difficulty is moderate. Route is largely gravel and forest service roads requiring only intermediate off-road skills, though weather transforms any section into technical challenge. Similar technical demands to Gravel Worlds."

  "elevation": {
    "score": 5,
    "explanation": "200,000 feet of total climbing over the course—roughly equivalent to climbing Everest from sea level seven times. OneOfSeven Rider reports the brutal reality: \"Over the next 3+ miles I barely rode my bike. My arms were as tired as my legs by the time I stopped.\" Daily climbing averages 2,500-4,500 feet, some days exceeding 4,500 feet. The scale of accumulated vertical is unprecedented in cycling events. Among the hilliest in gravel, comparable to Badlands."

  "climate": {
    "score": 5,
    "explanation": "Historical weather data shows average highs of 64°F and lows of 38°F, with a 62% chance of rain on any given day. Edyn Teitge describes day two weather: \"The day started overcast but still pretty nice. The sun even came out for a bit, but just around noon, it started raining. Up at the summit of the second pass of the day is where I met the first bit of snow.\" You experience every climate zone across 2,700 miles. Snow possible any time at elevation. Weather is the primary race factor—adaptability determines survival. Among the most weather-friendly events, easier than Badlands."

  "altitude": {
    "score": 5,
    "explanation": "Indiana Pass reaches 11,913 feet—highest point. Colorado sections regularly exceed 10,000 feet with multiple 11,000+ foot passes. Elevation data from rider reports shows sustained time at 7,300+ feet throughout the route. Extended time above 8,000 feet throughout route. Sleep deprivation compounds altitude effects. Acclimatization impossible for most starters who arrive from sea level. Among the highest-altitude events in gravel, on par with Badlands."

  "adventure": {
    "score": 5,
    "explanation": "The bikepacking version of the Great American Road Trip. Canada to Mexico through Whitefish, Cabin Pass, Galton Pass, Kananaskis Lakes, The Wall, and Red Pass. OneOfSeven Rider reports conditions from \"beautiful crushed gravel paths to muddy single track\" and rocky hike-a-bike sections. Daily geography changes dramatically through North America's most spectacular terrain. This is a life-defining experience riders describe as the ultimate expression of freedom."

  "prestige": {
    "score": 5,
    "explanation": "The halo event of bikepacking ultra-racing. The longest, most challenging mountain bike time trial on the planet. Established in 2008, it has defined the genre of self-supported ultra-endurance cycling. Names like Mike Hall, Lael Wilcox, and Justinas Leveika are legends specifically because of Tour Divide. Only ~716 finishers in history. Finishing is a lifetime achievement."

  "race_quality": {
    "score": 5,
    "explanation": "Paradoxically elite despite zero organization. No entry fee, no prizes, no sponsors—pure amateur ethos. The 198 riders mentioned in 2024 reports included elite racers like Adam, Bryan Rogala, and Kristen Legan alongside recreational riders like Ozogan. SPOT tracking provides live race following via TrackLeaders and DotWatcher. The minimalist approach creates a purer racing experience where every decision is yours alone."

  "experience": {
    "score": 5,
    "explanation": "Mac Tyler Fox describes lasting physical impacts: \"At some point during the race, I lost feeling in them [toes]. The numbness didn't bother me too much during the ride or even immediately afterward. What began to worry me was how long the numbness persisted. For weeks after finishing, I had numbness in all my toes.\" The suffering and beauty combine into something that reshapes how finishers see themselves forever."

  "community": {
    "score": 5,
    "explanation": "Legendary culture built on mutual respect and shared suffering. The 2024 field included riders from unknown to elite levels: Mac Tyler Fox, Adam, JJJJustin, Ozogan, Bryan Rogala, Brett Simpson, Edyn Teitge, Kristen Legan, and Dave Gieger. Those who finish share a bond that transcends typical racing camaraderie. No commercialization preserves authentic adventure cycling values. The community is small but intensely dedicated—a true tribe."

  "field_depth": {
    "score": 5,
    "explanation": "The deepest field in ultra-endurance cycling with 198 riders in recent years. Elite riders like Adam, Bryan Rogala, and Kristen Legan race alongside competitive riders like Edyn Teitge and Dave Gieger. Brett Simpson finished 14th in 20 days 21 hours, demonstrating the depth required even for mid-pack placement. Competition at the front is world-class. Even mid-pack finishers are serious athletes who have trained for months. Elite-level competition, on par with Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego. As JJJJustin puts it: \"As for the bike I don't think I could have built a better setup. I raced on an Otso Fenrir Ti built with Wolf Tooth Components and a 100mm Fox 32 fork with drop bars, a dynamo hub powering kLite light...\""

  "value": {
    "score": 5,
    "explanation": "No entry fee. The race costs what you spend on resupply and travel. For a 2-4 week adventure across the Continental Divide, the value is extraordinary. Hotels in resort towns (Breckenridge, Steamboat) can be expensive, but bivvy camping is the competitive strategy anyway. The experience-to-cost ratio is unmatched in endurance sports."
  },
  "expenses": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "No entry fee, but real costs accumulate. JJJJustin's setup included Otso Fenrir Ti frame, Wolf Tooth Components, 100mm Fox 32 fork, dynamo hub powering kLite lights, and custom JPaks bags—representing significant gear investment. Flights to Banff, 2-4 weeks of resupply food, occasional hotels, and post-race travel home. Resort town stops are expensive. Total trip budget: $1,500-3,000+ depending on style. Similar expense level to Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."
