  "prestige": {
    "score": 5,
    "explanation": "Part of THE gravel event. The 100 carries Unbound's 'Super Bowl of Gravel' prestige. You're racing the same terrain as the 200-mile legends. The Unbound name on your finisher medal means something in gravel circles."
  },
  "race_quality": {
    "score": 4,
    "explanation": "Life Time runs a professional operation. Mass start with police escort, well-stocked checkpoint, neutral mechanics, Crew For Hire program. The expo and festival rival major cycling events. Cutoffs are strictly enforced for safety."
  },
  "experience": {
    "score": 5,
    "explanation": "The experience that defines gravel. 6 AM mass start rolling out of downtown Emporia with thousands of riders. Suffering through the Flint Hills. The iconic Commercial Street finish with crowds roaring. You earn your pint glass and story."
  },
  "community": {
    "score": 5,
    "explanation": "Emporia becomes 'Gravel City' for race week. The town's population swells 50% with 12,000+ visitors. Locals embrace the chaos. The shared suffering creates bonds. Described as 'Glastonbury for bikes.'"
  },
  "field_depth": {
    "score": 4,
    "explanation": "Strong competitive field with elite pros. Winners like Tiffany Cromwell (2x champ), Lauren Stephens, Stephen Hyde. Not the full elite field of the 200, but attracts serious talent. Sprint finishes are common among top contenders."
  },
  "value": {
    "score": 4,
    "explanation": "~$245 entry is reasonable for a world-class event with proper festival atmosphere, professional support, and the Unbound prestige. You get more than your money's worth in experience."
  },
  "expenses": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Emporia is affordable IF you can secure lodging. Housing costs spike during race weekend. Flights to Kansas City plus 2-hour drive. Budget $800-1,200+ beyond entry for the trip. Many camp to save money."
  },
  "length": {
    "score": 4,
    "explanation": "100 miles (actually ~103-108mi depending on year). A serious day in the saddle—elite men finish in ~5 hours, but mid-pack riders face 7-10 hours. The distance alone doesn't break you; the terrain does."
  },
  "technicality": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Not MTB-technical, but the flint rocks are brutal on equipment. Sharp, chunky gravel requires line selection. Washed-out gullies and primitive roads demand attention. Mud years add chaos. The terrain is simple but punishing."
  },
  "elevation": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "~3,600-4,373ft of climbing across 100 miles. The Flint Hills are 'deceptively challenging'—relentless rollers with punchy climbs that add up. No big peaks, just endless undulation that grinds you down."
  },
  "climate": {
    "score": 4,
    "explanation": "Kansas late spring is brutal. Temperatures can exceed 100°F in the afternoon. High humidity, full sun exposure on open prairie, and severe weather risk. 2023 showed the mud can be race-defining. Heat management is survival."
  },
  "altitude": {
    "score": 1,
    "explanation": "Emporia is ~1,200ft elevation—oxygen abundant. The challenge is heat, humidity, and terrain, not thin air. Sea-level athletes have no disadvantage here."
  },
  "logistics": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Emporia is small—hotels book out fast after lottery results. Kansas City airport is ~2 hours away. The town embraces race week but accommodations are tight. Many camp at the fairgrounds or stay in nearby towns."
  },
  "adventure": {
    "score": 4,
    "explanation": "The Flint Hills in late spring are stunning—wildflowers, big sky country, isolated ranch roads through America's last tall-grass prairie. The mass start experience, Commercial Street finish, and festival atmosphere create lasting memories."
