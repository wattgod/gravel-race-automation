The surfaces vary from smooth hardpack (fast) to chunky limestone (slow and punishing) to sandy two-track (pray your tires hold air).\n\nHere's what makes gravel different from road racing or mountain biking:"

Most gravel courses are rideable by anyone with basic bike handling skills and reasonable fitness. The bike does matter, but not as much as road racing where a 30-second gap becomes insurmountable. On gravel, you can have a mechanical, fix it, and still chase back.\n\nIt's self-sufficient. Aid stations exist but they're 25-40 miles apart and might run out of what you need. You carry your own food, your own tools, your own flat kit. When something breaks, you fix it. When you bonk, it's because you didn't eat enough. The race doesn't owe you anything.\n\nThe spectrum is wide. You can sign up for a 40-mile \"fun ride\" distance at most events and just enjoy being outside with a bunch of other people who also thought riding on dirt was a good idea. Or you can sign up for the 200-mile suffer fest and find out what you're made of. Both are valid. Both are gravel racing."
