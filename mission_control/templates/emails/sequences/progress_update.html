      <p>You're well into your plan now. Here's what's happening with your training:</p>
      <div class="insight">
        <p><strong>The build phase is working.</strong> The progressive overload in your plan is designed to push your threshold up over these weeks. The workouts should feel harder — that's the stimulus your body needs.</p>
        <p><strong>What to watch for:</strong> If you're nailing every interval target, your fitness is tracking. If you're consistently falling 5-10% short, we might need to adjust.</p>
      </div>
      <p><strong>Coming up:</strong> Your plan includes a recovery week soon. Don't skip it and don't add intensity. The recovery week is where your body consolidates the fitness gains from the build weeks. Riders who skip recovery weeks plateau — every time.</p>
      <p>If your race date has shifted or you've had a new FTP test, reply with the update and I'll adjust your remaining weeks.</p>
      <p>You're doing the work. Keep going.</p>
      <p>— Matti</p>
