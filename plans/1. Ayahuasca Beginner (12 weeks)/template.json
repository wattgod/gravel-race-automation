But life happens—work, family, responsibilities limit your time. This plan accepts that reality. You won't be competitive. You won't feel amazing. But you WILL finish if you: (1) Execute this plan consistently, (2) Start the race VERY conservatively, (3) Fuel aggressively from mile 1. HIIT (High-Intensity Interval Training) gives maximum fitness in minimum time. Short, hard bursts build both aerobic and anaerobic capacity faster than long slow rides. Every minute counts. • WEEK PREVIEW: Foundation week. Tuesday has HIIT introduction (6x30sec HARD). Thursday is optional easy ride. Saturday is longer ride if possible. This week establishes baseline and introduces HIIT efficiency. Reality check: if you only do Tuesday's HIIT (30-40 min), that's OK—that's minimum effective dose. • REST DAY NOTE: Fine to ride if you really want, but no longer than an hour and don't break 30 TSS.",
