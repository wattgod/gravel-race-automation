This is counter-intuitive—most cyclists ride too hard on easy days and not hard enough on hard days, living in \"no man's land\" (Z3). Polarized training fixes this: easy days stay TRULY easy for recovery, hard days can be TRULY hard because you're recovered. This is proven for well-trained athletes pursuing competitive performance. The discipline? Staying easy on easy days. It feels slow. It feels like you're not training hard enough. Trust the science—polarized distribution produces superior fitness for athletes with solid background. • WEEK PREVIEW: Foundation week. Tuesday has FTP test (sets training zones). Thursday introduces first hard session (VO2max intervals). Saturday is first long easy ride (3-4 hours). Notice: ONE hard session, EVERYTHING else easy. That's polarized. • REST DAY NOTE: Fine to ride if you really want, but no longer than an hour and don't break 30 TSS.",
