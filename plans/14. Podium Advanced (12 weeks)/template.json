Weeks 5-8: maintain volume, add quality. Weeks 9-12: sharpen while preserving durability. Testing week—FTP Tuesday, durability assessment Saturday. You need 20-25 hours weekly. If you don't have that time, this isn't your plan. • WEEK PREVIEW: Foundation assessment week. Tuesday has FTP test + aerobic efficiency (45 min @ 65-70% FTP). Wednesday- This week establishes your baseline and introduces HVLI rhythm. • REST DAY NOTE: Fine to ride if you really want, but no longer than an hour and don't break 30 TSS.",
