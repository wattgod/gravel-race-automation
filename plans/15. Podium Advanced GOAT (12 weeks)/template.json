This is the Integrated Pyramidal approach: massive aerobic base with strategic intensity throughout. Elite gravel racing demands everything—you have the time to train everything. • WEEK PREVIEW: Tuesday has comprehensive testing. Wednesday is volume + technique. Thursday has durability assessment. Friday is easy. Saturday is peak long base (5-6 hours). Sunday has multi-system quality. • GOAT PHILOSOPHY: Volume is the foundation. Intensity is the sharpening. At 20-25 hours/week, you have enough volume to develop all systems. We'll train VO2max, threshold, durability, and neuromuscular throughout—not in isolated blocks, but integrated intelligently. • REST DAY NOTE: True rest. You're about to do serious work. Sleep 8+ hours tonight.",
