This plan uses G-Spot (87-92% FTP) and Threshold (95-105% FTP) because they deliver maximum fitness gains in minimum time. Every minute counts. No junk miles. You'll do 2-3 quality sessions per week with everything else as rest or very light recovery. This is about FTP gains and race pace power—the most important metrics for gravel racing success. • WEEK PREVIEW: Foundation week. Tuesday has FTP test (20 min max sustained effort). Thursday introduces G-Spot intervals (3x10 min). Saturday is tempo endurance (75-90 min). This week establishes your baseline and introduces time-efficient intensity. • REST DAY NOTE: Fine to ride if you really want, but no longer than an hour and don't break 30 TSS.",
