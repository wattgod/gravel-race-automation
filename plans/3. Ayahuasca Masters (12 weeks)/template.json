If you track HRV (heart rate variability), check it each morning. High/normal HRV = green light for quality. Low HRV = easy day or rest. No HRV tracker? Use perceived recovery: good sleep + feeling fresh = quality okay. Poor sleep + heavy legs = back off. Your body is the best coach. Listen to it. • WEEK PREVIEW: Foundation week. Tuesday has FTP test (if feeling good) or easy ride. Thursday is easy endurance (if recovered). Saturday is longer easy ride (if feeling strong). This week establishes your baseline and HRV monitoring routine. • REST DAY NOTE: Fine to ride if you really want, but no longer than an hour and don't break 30 TSS.",
