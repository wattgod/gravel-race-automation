You have 8-12 hours weekly—enough for performance IF trained intelligently. This plan combines TWO proven approaches: (1) Autoregulation via HRV monitoring, and (2) Polarized distribution (80% easy, 20% hard). Check HRV daily if possible. High/normal = green light for quality. Low = easy day or rest. No HRV tracker? Use perceived recovery: good sleep + fresh legs = go. Poor sleep + heavy legs = back off. Polarized = easy days TRULY easy (Z1-Z2), hard days TRULY hard (Z4-Z5+), almost nothing in middle. Masters principle: recovery IS training at 50+. • WEEK PREVIEW: Foundation week. Tuesday has FTP test (if HRV green). Saturday is first long easy ride (2-2.5 hours). Track HRV daily to establish baseline. • REST DAY NOTE: Fine to ride if you really want, but no longer than an hour and don't break 30 TSS.",
