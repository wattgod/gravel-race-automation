## Research Instructions

You are researching **Iowa Wind and Rock** for the Gravel God Cycling race database.

### Step 1: Web Research (find 5+ distinct sources)

Search for and open at minimum:
1. Official race website — extract vitals, registration, course info
2. Reddit threads (r/gravelcycling, r/cycling) — rider experiences, race reports
3. YouTube race recaps — look for course footage and commentary
4. Forum threads (TrainerRoad, Slowtwitch) — training/equipment discussions
5. News coverage (VeloNews, CyclingTips, Escape Collective) — race results, profiles
6. RideWithGPS or Strava — route data, segment info

For each source, extract:
- Specific mile markers and named course features
- Weather data (temperatures, conditions by month/year)
- Equipment recommendations with reasons
- DNF rates and reasons
- Real rider quotes (with attribution: username, source)
- Logistics details (parking, lodging, aid stations)

### Step 2: Write Research Dump

Output a markdown research dump with these sections:

```
## OFFICIAL DATA
[Race vitals, registration, course details from official site]

## TERRAIN & COURSE
[Surface types, named climbs/features, mile-by-mile breakdown]

## WEATHER & CLIMATE
[Historical conditions, temperature ranges, wind patterns]

## REDDIT & FORUM INSIGHTS
[Real rider quotes with u/username attribution]

## SUFFERING ZONES
[Specific named sections where the race gets hard — real geographic names]

## DNF FACTORS
[What makes people quit, with data if available]

## EQUIPMENT CONSENSUS
[Tire recommendations, gear setup, what experienced riders run]

## LOGISTICS
[Airport, lodging, parking, food, packet pickup]
```

### Step 3: Quality Requirements

- Every statistic must have a source URL
- Every suffering zone must have a real geographic name (not "the hard part")
- At least 1 real rider quote with attribution
- No generic filler phrases ("amazing experience", "world-class")
- No fabricated data — if you can't find it, say "DATA NOT FOUND"
