      "climate": {
        "score": 3,

      "altitude": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Maximum elevation of 300m at the start means sea-level racing with zero altitude impact on performance. Finishing at 150m in Badajoz keeps you firmly in the oxygen-rich zone throughout the course."

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Three feed zones at km 30, 55, and 93 show basic organization, but course specs remain inconsistent — UCI lists 123km/864m while race website claims 137km/1,370m. Elite finish margins of 1 second (men) and 21 seconds (women) suggest proper competitive execution."

      "experience": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Starting at UNESCO World Heritage fortifications in Elvas and finishing at Guadiana Park in historic Badajoz creates cultural depth. The course passes through 'seemingly untouched nature reserves and farmed pastures' connecting medieval Portuguese and Spanish heritage sites."
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Being part of the UCI series means legitimate qualifying opportunities for age-group riders chasing World Championships spots. The Portugal-Spain border theme creates natural camaraderie around the unique geography. But zero rider testimonials or race reports in the search results suggests the community buzz is limited to participants, not the broader gravel scene."
      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Matthew Holmes used road professional experience to edge Jose Maria Sanchez Ruiz by one second after 3:13:25. The presence of former pros and gravel specialists like Annabel Fisher elevates competition beyond typical amateur fields."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "€50-70 tiered entry fees are reasonable for a UCI-sanctioned event with World Championship qualifying opportunities. The cross-border logistics complexity and cultural heritage venues justify the cost for serious age-group competitors chasing qualification spots."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 2,
