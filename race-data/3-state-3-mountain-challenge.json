        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Steve Maas learned the hard way: \"A lot of people go too hard climbing the first two hills and do not leave enough in the tank for the last one.\" His advice to pace early and save energy for Burkhalter Gap shows 65 miles creates proper strategic consequences without ultra-endurance demands. Similar distance to Crusher in the Tushar."

      "technicality": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "The three climbs escalate in difficulty - Suck Mountain runs 5 miles at 4-6% gradients, Sand Mountain comes \"shorter and steeper,\" then Burkhalter Gap hits 20-22% grades for the final 500 yards. Steve Maas saw riders walking that last pitch despite having a 28-tooth low gear. Similar technical demands to Gravel Worlds."

      "elevation": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "6000 feet over 65 miles delivers serious climbing density - nearly 100 feet per mile. The three major climbs create distinct suffering sessions rather than endless grinding, which builds character without destroying souls. Past riders called it 'challenging but very satisfying when completed' - that's honest elevation work. More climbing than SBT GRVL at the same score. As Rolling terrain after climbs puts it: \"The rolling stretch atop Lookout Mountain has more climbing than I recalled. Or my legs were just tired.\""

        "explanation": "Historical weather data shows average highs of 76°F and lows of 57°F, with a 57% chance of rain on any given day. Alabama in cycling season means heat, humidity, and unpredictable spring weather. 'Rain or shine' policy acknowledges you might get hammered by conditions. No specific weather data for typical race dates, but Lookout Mountain region can serve up everything from perfect temps to swamp-level misery. More weather exposure than Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego. As Pedal Wench puts it: \"I've done it twice - third attempt was rained out. It's a wonderful ride, great support, and really interesting route.\""

        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Lookout Mountain region tops out around 2000 feet - basically sea level for mountain standards. Zero altitude considerations for training or performance. If you need altitude challenge, you're in the wrong state and definitely the wrong race. Lower altitude than Gravel Worlds — no thin-air concerns."
      },
      "adventure": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Three-state riding through Lookout Mountain delivers adventure - you're crossing Georgia, Alabama, and Tennessee borders on backcountry roads. The climbing creates real consequences and the rural setting keeps it wild. Past course link shows proper route planning through scenic terrain that justifies the 'mountain challenge' name."

        "explanation": "This race has serious identity issues. The original Chattanooga version had George Hincapie's name attached and hit its 30th anniversary in 2017, then apparently vanished. Now there's some Mentone, Alabama version with zero current registration info and no confirmed 2025 dates - that's not prestige, that's confusion."

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Hard to rate quality when the race might not even exist anymore. The Chattanooga version had decent organization with Litespeed frames as KOM prizes and proper packet pickup windows, but this Mentone iteration has no confirmed details, no current registration, and no race reports. You can't deliver quality if you can't deliver certainty."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "65 miles through Alabama's Lookout Mountain region hits the sweet spot for most gravel riders. Past versions included regrouping at climb tops and store stops, which keeps the social vibe alive. The 'rain or shine' policy shows commitment, but without current rider reports from Mentone, you're gambling on nostalgia."
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Originally backed by Chattanooga Bicycle Club with leaders like Rand Cimino organizing group rides at B pace (14-16 mph). The regrouping policy kept riders together instead of creating a pure suffer-fest. But community dies when races disappear - and this Mentone version has zero visible community engagement or current participant feedback."

        "explanation": "With a field of 200-400 riders, tennessee's 'biggest bike ride' claim from the Chattanooga days sounds impressive until you realize it's disappeared from the calendar. No current field size data, no pro participation beyond historical Hincapie connection, no competitive depth indicators. Shallow fields happen when races can't maintain consistent scheduling. Less competitive depth than Almanzo 100."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "65 miles and 6000 feet of climbing delivers solid bang for your buck if you can actually find registration. Past versions offered Litespeed frame prizes and decent support, but value crashes to zero when you can't even confirm the race exists. Good routes don't matter if they're not accessible."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Registration runs $60-100. Mentone area offers DeSoto State Park lodging and waterfront cabins that sleep 16, so group splits work. No current entry fees available, but rural Alabama typically runs cheaper than destination gravel scenes. Travel costs depend on where you're coming from - this isn't a cycling mecca. Similar expense level to Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

          "transcript": "Hello viewers. So I've just survived my\nfirst ever UCI gravel event just about\nit was a close call at times but I got\naround in mostly one piece and I\ndefinitely learned a few lessons and\nmade some mistakes along the way which\nI'll share in today's video. And also\nwe're here for some actual pros and more\nexperienced gravel cyclists about the\ntips and wisdom they can share with us\nall today which is especially important\nif you are doing your first ever gravel\nrace event or sportive. Better to learn\nfrom other people's mistakes than make\nthem yourself. So before we hear from\nthe pros, let me share my experience\nfrom riding the GRIC in Scotland at the\nweekend and the mistakes I made and the\ntips I would share with you based on my\nexperience. The first one is don't start\ntoo fast. I made the mistake of getting\ncaught up in the race for the first\ncorner, the first climb, and going way\nharder than I had planned. I'm a I'm a\nsucker for getting carried away at the\nstart of a race. And it was made\nespecially tough because we weren't able\nto warm up before the race. So going\nfrom standill to full gas in a matter of\nseconds was very tough on my old body.\nSo I would recommend a warm up before\nthe race or event if you can which\nwasn't available at the gratic because\nwe had to line up in our age pens about\n45 minutes before the start. So we stood\naround for ages with cold legs. So that\nmade it really tough. So given that cold\nstart, I would should have gone for a\nslightly more relaxed start. But I know\nthe importance of getting a good start,\nnot getting held up in traffic in the\nsort of pinch points through town and\ninto the first climb. And my aim was to\nget a good start and then provide some\nsliding space on the first climb, which\nI definitely did slide. I slid a long\nway back on that first climb as my my\nbody was screaming at me, my heart rate\nthrough the roof, and my glutes were\nshouting at me very loudly because of\nwhat I was asking from them from a cold\nstart. So unless you're racing to win,\nwhich I wasn't, and you are just racing\nto finish, maybe don't be so caught up\nin the start line pandemonium and ride\nto your own heart rate. Right to power\nif you have a power meter on your bike\nand try and pace yourself better than I\ndid on the first climb. I have a big\nmistake, the biggest one I regret is\ngoing higher on the tire pressures than\nI would normally do. I was freaked out\nby people punchering on the recon and my\nown experience of the recon and\nrealizing the gravel in Scotland in this\narea of Scotland is way tougher and way\nharder than anywhere I experienced in my\nlife. So to minimize the risk of\npunching even running tubeless because\neven with no inner tube to pinch with\ntubeless you can still pinch the tire\nsidewalls between a rock and a rim and\nit's also damaging the rims to be\nconscious about as well. So I went\nhigher on the tire pressures to minimize\nthe risk of a failure. But in doing so,\nI minimized the amount the tire can\ndeform on a rough ground and minimize\nhow much suspension I effectively had.\nAnd my arms just couldn't cope with the\nrelentless pounding over 4 hours of\nracing. So I should have stuck to my\nguns. as stuck to low pressures I know\nwork for me and relied on my faith in my\nequipment choices on the day and not be\ndeterred by what's happening around me\non the the day before the race. Those\nthen are the mistakes I made and the\ntips I take away from my first ever UCI\ngravel race. But now, let's hear from\nsome actual gravel pros who did much\nbetter in a race than I did and some\nmuch more experienced and seasoned\ngravel riders about the tips and wisdom\nthey can share with us in today's video.\nI would definitely say make sure to take\ncare of your equipment in this race\nespecially cuz it it's pretty rocky.\nIt's pretty chunky out there and a lot\nof people's races ended last year like\nmine last year ended just with like a a\nbig hit and I just was using wheels that\nweren't strong enough. Um so you broke\nyour wheels. I broke my front wheel.\nOkay. So, I kind of had to limp home the\nlast 15k or so and my race is done. Like\nI just stopped thinking I had a flat and\nI stopped and sealant was coming through\nthe rim. Uh so, so that was a pretty\nthat was pretty bad. But yeah, I would\nsay yeah, have your uh equipment dialed\nand when in doubt or there's a a classic\nsaying in Canada at least like it's\nbetter to be looking at it than looking\nfor it. So, it's better to have in this\nrace like a bit wider tires, having foam\ninserts, a little bit lower pressure\njust because yesterday if you're like\nwith road you're everyone's nickeling\nand dimming like oh I got I have to have\nthese aeros socks I have to have this\nhelmet's faster than this helmet where\ngravel it's like well we're going to\naverage 30 odd tomorrow and it's half up\nhalf down and like the aerodynamics on a\ndownhill are less important and uphill\nyou're going 20k an hour and it's it's\nbetter just to have maybe a couple more\nwatts here and there but have like a\nreally a bike you can trust\nI think is really key. And then for\nnutrition, it's just keep getting it in.\nI'm going to use the uh Castelli has\nlike a a hydro pack for the back. So\nlast year there was bottles being\njettisoned all over the course on some\nof the rockier downhills. So I just have\nthe hydro bag. So I'm like, \"Okay, got\nthe foam inserts. I got the wide tires.\nMy all the liquid I need is on my back.\nSo if I lose a bottle, it's like, okay,\nI have enough water, the bare minimum on\nmy back to get me through the whole\nrace.\" Um especially because Grow\nit's very nature conscious and they\ndon't want people driving all over in\nthe national park here.\nUm it's it's good to just make sure you\nhave the stuff you need at the start.\nHave a bike you can trust and not like\nnot risk it cuz it's a it's a long lot a\nlong way to come up here to Scotland and\nrun too narrow of tires or road pedals\nor something where it's like oh that\nbroke my race is done. My day is done.\nSo that would be my advice is\nplay it safe. for food and for\nequipment. We're here at the Grow. Yes.\nWhat one bit of advice would you give to\nsomebody doing their first gravel event,\nwhether racing or just riding for fun?\nIs there one bit of advice that you\nwould offer them or mistakes to avoid?\nUh bike setup or nutrition or casing?\nWhat's the thing? Can I give two? You\ncan give two. Yeah, of\ncourse. A lot of salt on board cuz you\nespecially like it's I mean it's\nprobably about 50° right now. You will\nlose so much salt. get salt tablets in\nyou. I think that's a thing that a lot\nof people just don't do correctly anyway\nwhen they're hydrating is like you need\nsalt as well as water to be able to\nhydrate. So take on salt. Uh and my\nsecond one would be put the biggest\ntires you can on your bike cuz like in\nterms of comfort makes a massive\ndifference. A third one use a tire\npressure calculator. Stra do one,\nWolftooth do one. They are really good\nat giving you an idea of what kind of\npressures you should be running and\nit'll probably come out a lot lower than\nyou think, especially if you're coming\nfrom more of a road background. Uh, but\ntrust the process. Take a little bit out\nevery time and the confidence it will\ngive you is unbelievable. I I I mean I I\ndid the\nthe Flanders Sport what a month or so\nago and I ran 32s\non a Argon 18 Krypton which is their\nlike all road bike and I ran 30 PSI.\nWow. Okay, that's low. Yeah, I had I had\na great time. And on this I'm running\n20. Please put your hands\ntogether to 54. I mean I just went that\nfeels about right. That'll do. I did\ncheck it. Yeah, about two days ago. But\nlower better generally. Lower is\ngenerally scared going low. Yeah,\nexactly. I think I think a lot of people\nare quite nervous about that, but it\nwill really change your experience a\nlot, I think. And it will give you a lot\nmore confidence, especially especially\ndescending some of the rough stuff. It\nreally does change that. Hi, I'm Toby\nPerry and I'm from Ashford, Kent. And\nwhat bit of advice would you give to\nsomebody doing gravel for the first\ntime? I'd say just be confident and\ntrust your bike because it can do a lot\nmore than you think. That simple. Yeah.\nYeah. do that. Everyone gets really\nnervous and twitchy and when you tense\nup is when you crash and have problems.\nSo, as long as you're calm, you end up\nbeing fine. What give you like bike\nsetup equipment choices, gearing, tires?\nUh, slightly wider tires is always just\nnice for extra bit of grip and that and\njust gives extra bit of comfort. So,\nyeah, it fits like biggest tires you can\nfit on your bike normally and see what\nsee what you enjoy. just checking\neverything's tight and the amount of\npeople I see with like just their shoe\ncleat that come loose after two hours of\ngravel and I have I've had it happen to\nme where my cleat and I've lost the\ncleat bolt. So just checking\neverything's at the right torque, the\nright settings and that's how I can only\nsay to people prepare your bike. Like\njust\ndon't just think, oh yeah, it's tires\nand everything else. It's it's\neverything. My biggest tip would be\nimproving your bike handling skills. And\nI think this is the problem that most\nriders have when they're doing their\nfirst gravel event. It's not like road\nwhere there's a you can just pick any\nline. You need to look through the\ncorners, pick your lines very carefully.\nUh basically hits the apex and then exit\nthe corners. And yeah, always looking\nahead of you if there's any obstacles\ncoming up such as large rocks. You don't\nwant to be hitting those. So yeah, just\nimproving your confidence on the bike as\nmuch as possible. I think that would be\njust a general really good tip that a\nlot of people can improve from. So there\nwe are. Hopefully some useful tips and\nadvice if you are doing your first\ngravel event. And if you are, let us\nknow what event you're doing by dropping\na comment down below. And if you are\nwatching this and you have done some\ngravel events and you feel there's some\nadvice and tips that were missed in\ntoday's video, then feel free to drop a\ncomment down below. But that is all for\ntoday. I'll see you again very soon.\nThank you so much for watching.",

          "transcript": "there's probably a pretty good chance\nthat most of you fall in between a size\nrange and by that i mean between the\nsmall and the medium between a medium\nand a large i personally am a medium and\nthis really makes bike purchasing really\ncomplicated because you definitely don't\nwant to buy the wrong size bike because\nyou've spent all this money there's a\nbike shortage what are you going to do\nin this video i'm going to share with\nyou some things i've learned\nbeing in between sizes to help you guys\nmake a better bike purchasing decision\nokay behind me i've got two bicycles i\nhave a crest bambora in size small and a\nbear claw thunderhawk in their size 52.5\nwhich would be the equivalent of a crest\nbamboor in size medium i brought these\ntwo bikes out because it'll give you a\ngood sense of what to expect if you size\ndown as opposed to sizing up one of the\nbig challenges of sizing is body\nproportions not everybody's bodies are\nproportioned the same way so for example\ni'm 5 8 which is a pretty average height\nfor a male in the united states however\nmy inseam length is 29 inches so that\nmeans i have the legs of a much shorter\nperson one of the old rules of thumb of\nbike sizing is standover height so you\nknow what that is you\nprop the bike up you throw a leg over\nand you make sure that you can lift the\nbike up and there's some clearance and\nthat works if you have normal height to\nleg ratio but i do not so even on the\nsize small i don't have the recommended\nstandover clearance and this has been\nkind of the bane of my\nbike riding experience i tended to put\nmore weight over standover clearance and\nbecause of that i tend to\nsize down when i'm stuck in between two\nframes which is pretty much all the time\nthe downside however of doing this is\nyou do end up\nwith a lot more spacers\nunder your stem i mean personally this\ndoesn't bother me a whole lot but but\nfor some it might and some people just\nfeel compelled to point out the number\nof spacers below your stem so that's why\nrecently\nwhen i purchased the bearclaw\nthunderhawk i bought a size up a 52.5\nwhich when you compare it on bike\ninsights is pretty close to the\nmedium-sized bamboora the end result of\nthat is that i'm running fewer spacers i\nthink the bike generally looks a little\nbit more balanced the downside however\nis again because of my\nshort legs to my height ratio i have\nlike zero standover in fact this is kind\nof gently prodding me upwards when i\nstep when i straddle the bike so you can\nsee it's a balancing act between\nstandover height and enough stack so\nyou're not running like a ton of spacers\nand reach so you're not running a super\nstubby stem so reach is this horizontal\nmeasurement and although it's fixed you\ndo have a fair amount of flexibility\nin increasing or decreasing the reach\nand and by that i mean you know stem\nlength your handlebars ad reach as well\nas the brake hoods so while reach is\nfixed it's actually pretty flexible\nstack height however the measurement\nthat kind of determines how high you can\nget your handlebars without putting a\nton of spacers below it is kind of\nharder to fudge with first off if you've\ngot a bike with a carbon steer tube you\nprobably only want to take it so high\nbefore it gets too dangerous too much\nexcessive force that might break the\nsteer tube you have a little bit more\nlatitude with height with an alloy steer\ntube if you really want to get your\nhandlebars high definitely look for a\nfork with an alloy steerer tube not a\ncarbon one so back to stack and reach in\nterms of frame size so here i'm looking\nat the crest bambora in size small and\nmedium and just isolating stack and\nreach and what's interesting is that\nbetween the two sizes even though you\nwent up a full size that reach number\nonly increased by four millimeters but\nthe stack increased by 23 millimeters so\nwhat that tells me is that if you like\nto have your handlebars in a fairly\nupright position it might be worthwhile\nconsidering sizing up again in that\nexample you gain over 20 mil of stack\nyou can run less spacers the bike's\ngoing to look a little bit better\nproportioned you will have to kind of\nnegotiate that standover height issue\nhowever so let's look at the geocharts\nfor the bombora and the bear club as you\ncan see the reach difference between the\nsmall bambora and the 52.5\nbear claw again increased by just the\ntiniest bit at 3.4 millimeters the stack\nhowever increased to 17 millimeters so\nalmost 20 ml and you can kind of see how\nthat plays out in the build fewer\nspacers in the front slightly less seat\npost showing in the rear like i\nmentioned earlier however\ni have no standover room on the bear\nclub but i'm okay with it i'm okay with\nit and this is why so for me i'm going\nto treat the bear claw mostly as a all\nroad bikes and be riding paved roads\ngravel roads and because it is an\nall-road bike i think standover is less\nof an issue\nunlike would say a mountain bike or a\ndrop bar mountain bike where i'm going\nto be taking it on more single track or\ntechnical terrain where i may have to\nput a foot down really quickly that's\nwhen i would want more standover height\nhowever since it's mostly going to be\nlike a road bike for the vast majority\nof time i probably won't be dabbing my\nfoot or having to put a foot down very\nquickly that's a compromise i made with\nthis bike and i'm completely okay with\nit if you're going to be riding a bike\non generally non-technical terrain and\nwon't have to do super quick dismounts\nthen then sizing up might be okay this\nis the size medium of the tumbleweed\nstargazer and there's a couple things\ngoing on here first\nyou can see here i have fewer spacers\nthan i have on the bear claw and that is\nbecause this bike has a lot of stack to\nit so that means it makes it really easy\nto get the handlebars nice and high if\nthat's what you want one way you can\nmitigate this whole standover issue\nthing if you're going on technical\nterrain with with a bike that is\nslightly larger is if you look for a\nbike with a sloping top tube this would\nbuy you some of that stand over\nclearance that you don't get with a\nhorizontal top tube bike so while i'm\npulling random bikes out of the garage\ni'm gonna talk about one more thing\nwhich i'm sure someone will ask\nis\nwhat do you do\nif\nyou're gonna be using an alt bar that\nsweeps back\nif you look at the drop bar bike you\nknow clearly you've got a stem moving\nforward and then the handlebar that\npushes you forward still and then your\nshifters with a flat bar bike or an all\nbar bike you can see that the handlebars\nare going to be working to move you\nbackwards and to counteract this\ntypically you'll have to run a really\nlong stem so this is 120 and you might\nalso have to raise the bars\na fair bit to get it comfortable what\ndoes all this mean in the size\ndiscussion if you're stuck between two\nsizes and you're going to run a sweat\nback bar definitely choose the larger\nsize this will help with the reach a\nlittle bit but definitely the stack\nheight so to summarize if you're in\nbetween\nsizes and if you value standover height\nover anything else then size down\nhowever if you know that you're going to\nwant to raise your handlebars you know\nfairly level with the saddle if not a\nlittle bit taller then consider sizing\nup you'll run fewer spacers granted\nyou'll lose that standover height but in\nthe long run it will make it easier to\nget the bars up if you're going to be\ndoing lots of technical riding where you\nhave to get off really quickly that may\nbe not a good idea look for a bike with\na sloping top tube or if you're like me\nand you know that bike is going to be\nused mostly on road and you've made the\npiece of sacrifice and stand over height\nfor a better stack number then size up\nhopefully this video was helpful and not\ntoo confusing let me know your\nexperiences if you're caught between\nsizes do you size up or do you size down\nwho else is

I had an absolute BLAST even though I thought I was going to lose my fingers.\n\nRasputitsa Gravel Road Race is a 40mi mud race in Bruke Vermont. There is lots of backcountry gravel roads with 2 very technical sections. Almost 2,000 people were registered for the race so it was full gas form the gun. \n\nClifbar brought my coach Tony from ATP Coaching and my self out to the Rasputitsa Gravel Road Race to see what its all about. It did not disappoint! Gravel racing is so much fun as its a great mix between fools gas racing and having fun on a bike. \n\nReally hope you enjoy the full story of my first ever gravel race at the Rasputitsa Gravel Road Race.

be\neasy no big deal so now I flew into\nBoston and then from Boston we drove\ntowards Vermont area like northern I\nmean we're not far from the Canada\nborder Canadian border waiting around\nbaby let's just pretend I want to stay\nlike this forever\nwanna stay right here would you\nthat's the rest we fall until it all\nbreaks down but I need him so I will\nstay\nwhen your almond\nit's a great\nwe get into Berk which is a very very\nsmall town and we're staying in this\nhouse that's like two hundred years old\nvery old house 100% haunted we were kind\nof exploring around and like in our room\nthere's a little baby crib super baby\ncrib with like a rocking chair that's\nlike right next to the crib so for sure\nmama ghost is like protecting the baby\nghost and it's like right at the foot of\nmy bed and then we check out this door\nwhich goes into the basement and look\nwhere I lived I don't have basements I\ndon't never had a basement open this\ndoor - just the scariest place on earth\nand so we go in town there and exploring\nthis basement which has like this rock\nwall that's like blown out demon gremlin\nbabies living in those rocks I could\njust imagine every time I looked in a\ncorner there's just like a black figure\nstanding there ready to kill me\nvery scary okay so then we don't have\nbikes and I brought up my tub my friend\nmy friend and coach Tony Wolfe to do\nthis together cuz I didn't I wasn't\ngonna know anyone I kind of wanted\nsomeone to bounce a story off of a\nlittle bit so he's there with me\nwill that's the guy who brought us out\nthat's our main contact he's from Clif\nBar Clif bars a sponsor of the event\nwill had provided specialized the bouncy\nones diverges like it's those like\nshocks in it that's what we were gonna\nwrite we're gonna ride specialized\ndiverges and we made sure to get there\non Friday with enough time that we could\ndial in the bikes and go for a ride I\nreally wanted to explore the surrounding\narea so then we went to the bike shop\nthat we thought they would be at and\nthey're like no we don't have your bikes\nyou know they had probably have been\nshipped to the ski resort so we go over\nto where registration where the party's\ngonna be where everything is gonna be\nhappening for this gravel right we get\nthere and they're setting up everything\nlike they have this hot making machine\nor you could make your own hats like you\nget these patches you put them on this\nhat and then they press them and then I\ntry to be an innovator and just do all\nthe patches I kind of collage thought I\nwas gonna come out really good it didn't\ncome out as good as\nas what was in my mind and they had like\na farmers market a part of the event I\nmean just inside this like ski lodge\nthere was just so much going on it was\nit was amazing there's a restaurant in\nthere we kind of hung out in there for a\nlittle while waiting for our bikes to\ncome we're waiting we're waiting waiting\nspecialized lady tells us your bikes are\nin New York they're not here along with\na whole other fleeted demo bikes from\nspecialized so then we're like okay\noh no and my coach is like you know\nStretch Armstrong so he has to ride a 61\nso we have like 61 bikes are really big\nbikes they're not common it's gonna be\nvery hard to find one for him so one of\nthe guys that works for Clif Bar he's on\nthe phone with a shop so then he\narranges bikes to come to us but they'll\nbe here at like 11 o'clock at night\nthat's not ideal but at least we have\nbikes right so we have a back-up plan\nbut we have no bikes and I see Canyon\nI see Canyon out there unloading some\nGrails so I go over and I'm talking to\nJeremiah Bishop I believe is his name\nand I was like dude I'm in a pickle I\ndon't have a bike to race tomorrow I see\nyou have a van full of them okay what\ncan we do I was trying to get - there\nwasn't any sizes he didn't have all the\nsizes so I could only get one but I got\none I got a Grail\nI was very big the freakin grill is a\nmassive bike feels like a mountain bike\nwithout suspension so we head back to\nthe haunted 200 year old house I start\nkind of fitting my bike for me for the\ncanyon grill getting my pedals on there\ngetting the GoPro on there getting the\nseat adjusted but I'm not very picky man\nI don't care it felt like a bike I loved\nit felt great\nwe moved the haunted chair in the\nhaunted baby crib out of our room so\nwe're not haunted but do you see what we\nwere moved out of here but you might\nhave disturbed go both ways\ndon't really piss them off but it also\nmight save us okay Mike they might stay\non out there now at least you guys won't\nhave the horror of knowing it's coming\nit'll happen you know like things will\nstart rocking beforehand new boots weird\nno just\n[Applause]\ni me and Tony got to start in the very\nfront and bro there was so many people\nI've never seen so many people it was\ncrazy but we're like you know third row\nme right there on the front pouring rain\nit's freezing cold I am like not very\nconfident in my setup or anything and I\nknow I'm gonna freeze\nbut like bro full set let's go we go\ndown the road it's like a neutral roll\nout go through the town of Burke it's so\ncold\nI mean literally in the first minute I\nwas like I can't feel my fingers already\nboy this is gonna be difficult and I had\nhonestly been anticipating a very\ntechnical race\nit's just slopping through mud lots of\nhiking bike single trail that's what was\nin my mind so we're we hit basically\nwhere the race starts and everyone's\nkind of battling for position to get up\nfront and we're on the road and did\nwe're full gas I mean I have a power\nmeter on but just on perception I would\nsay we're probably doing something 300\nto 450 watts for the first while\neveryone's trying to be up front\neveryone's trying to be up front and\nguys and I'm like dude this is this is\nintense\nnow I downloaded the map to my wahoo so\nI can see the route and I can see the\nprofile so I can I can see where climbs\nare but I don't know the terrain and\nthat's the biggest part of it's the\nterrain you're on so we're going over\nthe road and then finally we turn onto\nthe first dirt road but I mean it's been\npouring rain it's not really muddy to be\nhonest I mean it's soft but it's not\nit's not technical it's not it's not\ndifficult but man the front group of\nlike 20 they started taking off and I\nwhen I look back on this I wish that I\nhad had the wherewithal to go full gas\nand stay with that front group but I had\nno clue what I was in store for I had no\nidea I thought we were gonna be doing\nsome serious technical stuff later on so\nI kind of wanted to save my energy I\ndon't know dude I had no clue but for\nsure now I look back on it there was so\nmuch just you know\nthis road or fire road you know that\nmeant staying with a group like you roll\nso much faster as a group I should have\nbeen with that front group\nI should have bridged to them but I\ndidn't so the front group goes and then\nme and like a couple guys are sort of\nstuck in no-man's land and then I ended\nup bridging to another little no man\nland group but the first day the first\n20-30 minutes were just I mean you were\noh did you\nit was very Fitness II not technical\nlike you you had good fitness you're\ngonna be doing a lot better and also the\nbike choice even if you were on a fat\nbike or a bike with really big tires or\nyour pressure was low you know dude\nyou're it's such a huge disadvantage but\nmy bike set up I had 60 psi and the\ntires I felt great I if it rolled good\nrolled fast so me and like two guys are\nchasing the front group and we hit the\nfirst really technical section super\nmuddy you really got to pay attention to\nyour line if you if you unclip it's so\ndifficult to really get back on and\ngoing when the mud so sloshing it so\nthen I'm thinking dude this is it like\nthis is the rest of the race you know\nit's only 40 miles because 40 miles of\nit's like this then there's a whole\nsection with like hard pack ice snow\nroad so I'm trying not to ride on the\nsnow because it's super snowy and slick\nso then I'm like in the gutter on the\nright it was so much fun though just so\nmuch mud and like crazy chaos and this\nis what I had been expecting is so much\nof this right where it doesn't really\nmatter if you're in a group or not\nbecause it just all comes down to skill\nwe get out of that section and then I\ndon't know man for the rest of the race\nwasn't really anything else like that\nand now they did change the course last\nminute because of some of the roads were\njust so bad and so you know maybe they\ncut out some other technical sections\nbut me and the two other guys were with\nended up getting caught by a huge group\nof guys like 35 guys and I was like oh\nman I thought we were going fast\nand we just got caught by these guys so\nthen we're like in a group of 35 and\nwe're not really gonna catch the front\ngroup I think the front group was a\ncouple minutes up the road but we are in\na group that is racing maybe any other\ngroup behind us maybe they've kind of\ngiven up on racing they're just trying\nto survive but we're racing you know we\nhit climbs there's some like attacks or\nsome efforts but the roads are not are\nnot bad I mean for the weather\nconditions it's not it no big deal\nlike anyone can ride this row bro we're\nclimbing and we're climbing and we're\nclimbing and it is starting to get\nreally cold and then starting to snow\nand then we're getting closer and closer\nto the top as climbing bro it's just\nlike we're forging our way to the north\nto defend the wall gets the white\nwalkers who's coming\ninto his going\ninto his car\noh that's alright I'm fine you're not\nyou're freezing and it's just one of\nthose things over it's like god this\nsocks but you're also like god this is\nsuch a good story and this is epic and I\nI almost wanted to-- snow more just\nbecause i feel like we're going into\nbattle it was very it was very very cool\nbut it has been pretty much raining or\nsnowing the whole time and so my gloves\ni would squeeze my gloves and water\nwould just pour out and now we're gonna\ngo downhill my fingers smoked to the\npoint where I really feel like a lot of\nguys had to think I'm willing to cause\npermanent damage to my hands to stay\nwith this group just keep keep on racing\nbecause out of like something close to\n2,000 people you know we're we're top\ntwenty to thirty top twenty to thirty\nfive something like that it got so\nfreakin cold that my like my brain\nwouldn't work it wasn't working I had to\nwatch my hand shift because I couldn't\nfeel anything so I was like yeah just\nlike my whole arm just trying to shove\nthe shifting there's nuts did but the\nother thing is I'm thinking it's only\nforty miles and like we're cooking like\nwe're not I mean we're going pretty fast\nso I'm in my mind thinking bro like two\nhours three hours maybe I mean I that's\nnot that bad right that's not that hard\njust get through this cold and so then\nwe sort of get to maybe the last like\nten fifteen miles of the race and\nthere's a pretty good little climb and\nthen there were some attacks that\nstarted to come out of that and that's\nwhen our group of like thirty five blew\napart and I just barely made like the\nfront six guys out of this group and I\nwas in my head just thinking this is the\nrace is the race like you've got to go\nyou got to go you got to go so I got on\ntheir wheel and man they were so good at\ndescending I could not feel my hands\nthough so I didn't know how to like\nmodulate pressure on the front brake so\nwe got over this climb\nwere flying down the hill I don't you\nknow I might be full front break and I'm\njust gonna friggin send myself into\nBucks Ville it's just very cautious on\nthe descents I lost their wheel several\ntimes and so then I had to kind of like\npower back on get back onto the wheel\nbut I felt great felt really good on on\nclimbing and and fitness was was totally\nthere because it's like either you're\nclimbing and you're going pretty much as\nhard as you can or you're just surviving\nbecause you're freezing to death so I\ndon't really know what place I'm in at\nthis point\nbut I can see on the profile what's\ncoming up and I see there's a massive\nclimb a super steep climb and then\nthat's pretty much the finish we hit the\nclimb and it pretty much just sort of\nbreaks apart there there's like six guys\nto go pretty much up the road I tried to\njust settle in because it's such a long\nclimb really tried to settle into a pace\nthat I knew I could finish strong with\nthere were signs along this final climb\nthat was like remember you paid for this\nremember bikes are fun you know the\nquicker you finish the quicker there's\nbeer and the finish is just right there\nbut then it takes you on this left\nthrough a very technical section super\nmuddy I plow through that but I'm just\nlike I'm so cold and I'm kind of in\nno-man's land like I'm always always\nthem and so then I kind of get off the\nbike and I'm pushing and I see the\nfinish I'm like oh my goodness I'm so\nready to be done and so then I come\naround like the last turn and this guy\njust all of a sudden from nowhere like\nbumps me up on the inside and and now\nit's like a two-up sprint to the finish\nfor 25th and you nipped me at the line\nby half not even half a wheel like a\nbike throw it's crazy but he got me and\nso I got 26th out of whatever it was\nlike 1,500 people\nwe go guys the offside oh my god oh my\ngod\nother\nokay hands are frozen hands are frozen\nhere\nhi I'm frozen\neverything's frozen oh my god\nmy feet are good I had Bella toes on\nactually everything about me was was\ndecent it was just my hands completely\nnumb so then I go into the bathroom and\nI turn on the water and I just stick my\nhands and in like what essentially be\ncold water like I didn't really put on\nthe hot side it was ooze you know if you\nwere just normally you'd be like oh this\nis pretty cold water but since I was so\ncold it felt like it was piping hot and\nI just stuck my hands in there and\npretty much experienced very high levels\nof pain as I started to death ah I I was\nlike it was so painful that I tried to\nwalk around I kept walking around to get\naway from my hands because they were so\npainful but I couldn't get away from my\nhands so it's so funny because I'm just\nwalking around like ah my hands but once\nyou come out of that once you defy is\nthat you're full of all this I hate life\nbut when those feelings go away what's\nreplaced is just pure joy and just like\neuphoria and so then they had some food\nwhich they did have a vegan option they\nhad like this vegan bean thing that was\nreally delicious they had french fries\nand they had some kind of vegan salad so\nlike I was stoked I was eating that I\nhad some coffee\nshivering uncontrollably though just\nshivering like a splashing coffee\neverywhere\nI was so frigging cold and this is after\nI'm like starting to warm up just my\ncore body temperature just plummeted\nit was awesome like this erasers\nmechanical issues with their eyes\nwas the hardest part\nit was harder last year\na lot of guys lost their brakes like my\ncoach Tony he lost his brakes as well\nand he had to try to fix him\nI didn't lose brakes I had no\nmechanicals whatsoever I didn't even\nbring a tube with me I just thought if\nif my brake bike breaks down food would\nyou probably call it you know I'm not\ntrying I'm not trying to fix my bike in\nthe snow and the rain and the mud so but\nI didn't I had no issues the Grail has\nlike a two bar setup I didn't really use\nthe top bar very much I don't know it\nfelt great it's a good bike is very\nbeefy you know the Grail seems like more\nof a bike for single trail or some\nreally aggressive gravel road not not\njust like farm roads the the area which\nthis race is is phenomenal I'd love to\ngo back there when it wasn't snowing\nraining mud cold because I bet it's just\nsome of the best riding ever I will 100%\nbe back next year and I will be looking\nfor top ten for sure but if you're\nthinking about doing the Savannah I\nguess my takeaway is that it's honestly\nnot as technical as maybe it it was made\nout to be I was very worried about that\nsaid that a few times\noh there's in like two sections wasn't\nthat bad\nthere's a lot of climbing it's\ndefinitely a climbers thing but if you\nhave if you have power if you have\nendurance it's not that bad it's just\nthe weather it's just the elements so if\nI had really nice gloves on I might not\nhave had any issues whatsoever right\nbetter gloves makes this whole event and\nwhole experience ten out of ten but I\nreally like this one Ross spotted SIA\nhowever you say it phenomenal event next\ntime make it non snow\nbut I don't know I almost feel like the\nfact that it was snowing just makes it's\nsuch an amazing event like that that is\nthat is so much more a part of it is\nbattling the elements\nalso a huge thank you to my coach Tony\nfor coming out and hanging with me will\nfrom Clif Bar for arranging this whole\ntrip and getting me out there the rat's\npatoot SIA\nsorry if I'm butchering it yeah event\nphenomenal and Kanyon thank you for\ngetting me a bike last minute dude\nwhat's funny is that what I got done as\nas soon as I cross the finish line the\nguy from Canyon like ran over was like\npulling my stuff off the bike almost\nimmediately right like they were they\nwere like no extra miles is gonna be put\non this bike they they took it back from\nme real quick house kind of open maybe\nthat was let me take it home they did\nnot they did not anyway this is my first\ngravel race is a proper one thanks for\nwatching as always",

I walk you through the whole race, breakdown each sector, and give you my cycling commentary as the gravel race plays out.   \n\nThe belgian waffle ride has a mission to be known as the hardest one day bike races in North America, and this gravel race in Cedar City, Utah lives up to that goal. This gravel race had one of the best courses ive ever ridden. It wasn't too difficult so if you had good base fitness and bike handling skills, you felt pretty competitive for a while. \n\nBIKE SETUP : \nBike - Canyon Grail\nWheels - IRC double cross 38s on Princeton carbonworks rims\nGearing - 2x 50/34 - 11/40\nRoad Shoes and pedals \n\nNUTRITION: \n(What I started with)\nx2 cups of coffee\n600 calories in SIS gels\n900 calories in bottles\nx2 30g bottles of ketones (should be illegal)  \n(What I got on the road)\n2 waters\n4 SIS gels\n1 Cliff Block\n\nSTRAVA\nhttps://www.strava.com/activities/4208272197/analysis\n\nCheck out Dylan and his top 5 finish here - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri8mtN5O-0o\n\nDAILY VLOG VIDEOS: \nDay 1 - https://youtu.be/4SYlO9PmVNs\nDay 2 - https://youtu.be/f_8AO3wAGIQ\nDay 3 - https://youtu.be/uWI7UF6inKU\nDay 4 - https://youtu.be/FGH5k1SO5bk\n\n//////www.Whoop.com /\nhttps://bit.ly/2UXZ8zN follow this link and use code \"vegan15\" to get 15% off any membership\n\n//////The best kits in the world\nwww.ElielCycling.com - code veganbro10\n\n/////Hella sick Shirts n stuff\nhttps://www.ridebikesbro.com\n\n/////Recovery Shakes\nhttps://kyoku.com/ (Code \"thevegancyclist\" for 15% off)\n\nfollow me bruh\nhttps://www.facebook.com/theVeganCyclist\nhttps://www.strava.com/athletes/180549\nhttps://www.instagram.com/the_vegan_cyclist/\n\n#gravelracing #cycling #bikeracing #gravelbike\n\n0:00 Quick Recap\n0:48 My setup\n1:59 The Start\n7:26 54min \n9:02 1hr 30min \n11:48 2hr 10min \n13:48 2hr 45min \n15:35 3hr 25min\n17:49 4hr 23min\n20:05 5hr 18min\n22:23 5hr 42\n25:51 Final time & power",

          "transcript": "three two one here we go\nthe canyon waffle ride underway\nokay\noh yeah\nyou all right\n[Music]\nokay so before we jump into the race i\nwant to break down how i'm feeling how\ni'm going into this and my\nuh gear setup now the day of the race my\nwhoop score was 85\nso great i am feeling super good which\nwas good to see that\ntuesday and wednesday i was in the red\npretty much the whole week i was a turd\nnow have you ever seen this video where\nthis guy's bandaged up he has everything\nhe can possibly put on him to help him\nperform\nand then even with all those things that\nare trying to help him out he just fails\ninstantly\nthat's kind of how i'm doing i am\nbandaged up here i've got an arrow\nhelmet\ntry to help me go fast i've got 60\nmilligrams of ketones that's a lot\ni've got my amp lotion on my legs i've\ngot 600 calories 300 milligrams of\ncaffeine\nuh in gels on me i've got 900 calories\n300 grams of carbs in my bottles i've\ngot 50 psi\non 38 with aero wheels from princeton so\nmy setup is fast i've also got super\nstiff\nroad shoes i'm on the canyon grail which\nhas a gear ratio that my best is 34\n40 i'm really happy with this setup i'm\nfeeling good and\nwe're ready to just go as hard as we\npossibly can\nmy training has been really good going\ninto this and so we're gonna break this\ndown into\nthe different sectors so the first like\nsector one\nand two uh of gravel this includes our\nlittle lead in here\num it's 124 miles 200 kilometers\neveryone's got their masks on at the\nstart everyone's really trying to\nvie for the front because there's i mean\nthere's a lot of people here and there's\na big pinch point\nnow right here instantly there's a crash\nand what actually ended up happening is\nthat guy like pushed my back brake\nin i lost my back brake for a little\nwhile it came back eventually\nbut it was really scary uh to almost\nhave my race ended immediately\nso now we go through this tunnel and i\nknew that we pre-ridden this so i knew\nthis was going to be an\nimportant part i thought i was far\nenough up front\neveryone's just getting crammed in here\neveryone can't go and this is exactly\nwhat\ntravis had predicted is that it was\ngonna just be a total [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] show here\nyou can see cole in the white he\nactually dropped his chain so he's\nrunning through the tunnel um\nand so now full gas i mean you have\njust shot out of a cannon where you were\nyou know it's cold it's like 40 degrees\nthat was a big component of it is how\ncold it was at the start so\ni've i was actually really dialed in my\nldl gear i had like a\nthermal jacket and a vest gloves the\nwhole the whole thing\nbut so we are now trying to catch the\nfront group\nyou can't see anything i know that you\ncan see quite well here\nbut the dust was so bad i mean i could\nnot see the front i didn't know how far\nthey were\nand when we pre-rode this one of the\nbiggest mistakes is that when me and\ntravis pre-rode this we did not\nride it at race pace and the gravel is\ncompletely different when you are doing\n25 30 miles an hour versus doing 17.\nso everything felt way more rough and\nloose\nand just really unfamiliar\nand so now again my legs feel like\na ton of bricks because there was really\nno warm-up i mean we coasted into this\nlittle tunnel and then all of a sudden\nyou are full gas and so i'm trying to\nstay on some wheels we're going over\nthis climb guys are getting\nspit out there's gaps everywhere and i'm\nthinking\nthis was it i mean i've made it a whole\none mile\ninto the race before i'm no longer in\ncontention\nuh and i you know i don't even know what\nposition i'm in i don't know how\nfar up the front group is we finally do\ncome together and i'm like huh whoo\nglad that uh i saved this one right so\ni'm\nkind of trying to regroup gather myself\nand then there's a big wreck\nand it's so difficult to make quick\nadjustments because of how the gravel is\nso\ni saw that wreck coming from a while but\ni just couldn't stop or couldn't get\naround it\nso now again full gas chasing we're\ntrying to get back onto the group\nand we really need to get back on it\nbefore we start going downhill so you\ncan see\nthe front group up there it's it's a\nlittle hard to see\nuh but i don't know how far away they\nare i don't know if we're gonna catch i\ndon't know\nanything man um it's we are\nat elevation so it's about almost 6 000\nfeet above sea level\nand so then with the full gas poop pants\neffort\nright off the beginning and it being\ncold my brain is dead i really have no\nidea what's going on i have no far\ni have no idea how far back i am i'm\njust trying to pedal and so then now we\nhit the\nnext dirt section which this is like\nslightly downhill\nand again i know that it maybe looks\nlike you can see\nyou can't see you can't see 20 feet 30\nfeet in front of you\nand so if someone crashes which a lot of\npeople were you could just\nfull send right over the top of them and\nso i was being a little bit cautious\nhere\nuh definitely through these tunnels i\nwas just also\nreally disappointed with how my legs\nfelt in that\nopening of 10 minutes they just felt\nlike absolute bricks\ni don't know kind of intimidated a\nlittle bit thinking oh man i\njust do not have it today uh\ntrying to stay on these guys wheels i\nthe whole time\ni was sort of always just like a bike or\ntwo off of\neveryone's wheel and i just think that\nthat\ncomes from i just wasn't comfortable not\nknowing where i was going or\nwhat like i couldn't see i wanted to see\ni wanted to see what i was riding over\nuh we're flying through it's such a\nbeautiful scenery\nfor one it was gorgeous um the gravel's\npretty chunky here again\nat full gas race pace it is completely\ndifferent than we pre-wrote it\nwe do finally have everyone come\ntogether and so\ni guess i've made the front group but\nit's really big\nand so then i'm expecting you know that\nthis group is going to probably stay\nthis size for a little bit also again\njust not really thinking\nat elevation early the whole thing my\nbrain was just\nturned off and at this point i should\nhave\nfought as hard as i could to get to the\nfront we didn't pre-ride this part of\nthe course\nand uh or when we turned right here and\ni should have because i was\nway out of position you know probably\nlike top 50 here\nnow unfortunately this next section is\nit was the most important section\nand i have no footage of it my gopro\ndied\nand once we hit this section there was\nno way\ni could take my hand off to change the\nbattery so as we turn off this road\nsection and\nto basically where the first climb was\nyou know you can just see how way out of\nposition i am i'm probably top\n50 and i i just didn't know man i just\nhad no idea i guess how skinny this road\nwas or how it was going to play out\nbut this is where the front just lit it\nup\nand i could see nothing and i i don't\nhave really a good gopro shot this was\nprobably one of the most beautiful\nsections of the race and the gopro just\ndidn't get it\nright but is what it is you couldn't see\nanything and there were some downhill\nsections\nwhere you were just full sending into\ndust\nand there could be someone crashed i\nthere could be huge holes you just don't\nknow and so\nwe hit the first kom and i started\nreally feeling good my legs just came to\num i was feeling super confident and\nthen so once i kind of got through a few\nguys i'd realized\nthe front group is gone i can't even see\nthem\nso by the time i got to the front of the\nsecond group\nit's like shoot dude the race is pretty\nmuch over and then there's this huge\ndownhill section that i don't have on\nfootage\nand you know is everyone just doing what\nthey could to try to\nform their group okay so this next\nsection\nfor me personally was one of the hardest\nsections because guys were\nreally trying to bridge up to groups\nthey were trying to get back on terms\nwith the race\nyou know average 274 for this section\nwhich doesn't sound like a whole lot\nbut it really was um i got into a decent\ngroup of some strong guys\nand we were kind of picking up\num people getting blown off from the\ni have no idea where i am on the road at\nthis point\ni'm really starting to feel good it sort\nof feels like we're maybe the second or\nthird\ngroup on the road at this point and then\nit starts getting pretty technical\nthey have these little over under things\nand now\nwe're into these long stretches\nwhere the road is sort of split and line\nchoice was so important\ni swear it was like if you chose the\nwrong side of the road you'd be doing\n50 percent more energy or hit a patch of\nsand and\ngo to a complete stop it was uh it was\ncrazy how\ndifferent one line was and it would\nchange\nand so here i'm feeling super good and\nso now i'm just\npowering i'm getting over this the the\n50 psi and my 38s um are keeping me\nsuper efficient like i'm rolling so\nfast it is way unstable that was the big\nissue though\nis that i would hit little bumps and i\nkept coming unclipped\nlike there was because of the psi being\nso hard i'd hit little bumps and my\nliterally my shoes would just come out\nof the pedals which was something that\ni've\nreally never experienced i'm pushing the\npace this kid had caught us\nand is just drilling it i mean i'm doing\nlike 300 350 watts in his draft\nnow i'm going to kind of try to show you\nhow the groups were forming\nright so there you got the front group\nof like seven\ndylan johnson he's in it he did a\nphenomenal\nuh then you've got a bunch of guys blown\nout of that front group kind of coming\nbackwards\nthen you had a good sized group um that\nwas like a chase group\nokay and then my group which is a\nhandful of us\ntrying to get back on terms right and so\ni guess we're like the fourth group on\nthe road at this moment\nthen you have a bunch of guys that are\njust blown out of everyone and they're\ngoing back\neither having issues then you had a\npretty good sized group of some fast\nguys\ncoming um and then pretty much everyone\nelse\nyou know sort of just at this point\ngoing you know what our day's\nprobably over we're just gonna try to\nenjoy the ride\num you know a lot of people had crashes\nmechanicals\nissues in the beginning so i'm really\ngrateful that i\ni didn't have any mechanicals the next\nsector is\nfeels pretty flat but there's just a lot\nof little technical aspects\nwe hit some sand on this section uh\nwe're about two hours in at this point\nand so again the left or right\nyou know you could just be hauling balls\nand then all of a sudden\nthe lane that you were in was terrible\num\ni like i said i was always just slightly\noff everyone\ni was constantly trying to get back on\nterms uh\nhitting some sand now this\nsand was super deep and there was a lot\nof times where\nit was very easy for you to unclip and\nthen have to walk\ni didn't have to do that i was able to\nkeep my power up and really push through\nbut again some you can see the guy on\nthe left he had such a better line\ni'm just you know in the beach sand but\ni'm trying to save my power\nright so right now i could bridge that\ngap in front of me to this dude\nbut i'm not gonna be able to see where\ni'm going if i'm right on his wheel\nand then i'm gonna have to burn a match\nand i'm trying to keep it pretty steady\nmy power wise especially for this event\nif i just stay\nzone 3 low zone 4 i should be really\ngood\nso then now we get into a little more\nsand\nand a little bit of a climb everything's\ngood my\nchain though is so dry my chain was\nmaking noises i've never heard a chain\nmake before it felt like it was gonna\nsnap at any moment\nso now here's kind of how the groups are\nthere was a\nfew guys just up the road within\nbridgeable distance that i could get to\nuh but there was also a bunch of guys\nbehind me\nand so then i kind of had to make this\ndecision on what which group i was going\nto go with\nand i chose to stop and get some chain\nlube\nand then followed the group behind me\nthinking that the group behind me we\ncould\nget together and chase down the group in\nfront of us which actually ended up\nworking out great\nso then now this next section is sort of\nnot a whole lot going on but there was a\nbig road climb\non this section so on the road you can\nsee that it's me and these these three\nother guys and we're kind of trying to\ncatch this\nuh the little blue four guys up the road\nwe're not really making\nany sort of gain on them and\nthere's a huge group behind us that is\njust motoring\nso me and these three other guys sort of\nmake the collective decision to\nease up and go back to the group that's\ngaining on us anyway\nright and so which was a great decision\nbecause you could be going\nso hard uh but if there's like this\ngroup\nthey are not going that hard and they're\njust covering so much distance\nso it was really good to get in with\nthem especially going into the\nfirst or i think the second kom now that\nthis big climb here is on road so again\nmy 50 psi\nmy 38's my irc's uh\nthey're called the double cross they\nwere rolling\nso fast now guys started to break up\nit was pretty difficult it's pretty long\nclimb and so then you've got these guys\nup front\nthat are pushing the pace and i had to\ntry to bridge this gap you know i again\nit's really hard to know who's strong\nand who's not who's feeling it\num but on this climb it did that big\ngroup there\ni don't want to say it split in half but\na few people didn't make it over this uh\nthis big\nroad climb yeah my time on this kom\nactually gave me third overall in my age\nfor the km competition so we get over\nthe top everyone's sort of shaking their\nlegs out\nuh trying to feel out what this next\nsection is going to be like\nfeeling pretty good at this point you\nknow i've put down some good calories\nsome good carbs\nthose ketones are freaking magic and so\nthen this next section\nhas a little bit of technicality to it\nand then a\nhuge road section so as we get into this\nmore technical spot all i'm trying to\nthink is\ni have to stay with this group to the\nroad and\nyou know again the whole time i'm just\nbike links off of people i don't really\nknow why\nother than i was just nervous maybe i'm\nnot really sure\ngetting over here now some guys it\nseemed like they didn't have the right\ngearing\nthis guy i know he kind of went off the\nside there but a lot of people\nthey were grinding up these little\npitches so my 34\n40 i was able to spin i was able to keep\nthe legs light i was able to\nnot have to put a ton of torque and slip\nbecause that's one of the biggest\nthings with the gravel is that you know\nif you have a lot of torque\nyou know you're just spinning your\nwheels so a lot of your energy and your\npower is going to\nrotating your wheel and not actually\nmoving forward\nso i'm doing the best i can to try to\nstay with this group\nwe're flying the dust was so\nbad you could you could like literally\nyou could see nothing i couldn't see\nwhat was happening i couldn't see what\nwas\ncoming up and so this often would have\nme sort of fall off a little bit just so\nthat i could see\nanything and also my glasses the\nvisibility\nwas was something i did i hadn't really\nexpected but my glasses sort of\nuh had this like coat of dust on it so\nthere was like really bad glare it's\nkind of insane\nbut we get to the road section this\ngroup is\nfull of some seriously strong diesel\ntype motors i mean they are\nrolling and so then i we pre-rode this i\nknew\nwhat to expect here i knew that we were\ncoming into a big road section\nso i could just sort of really not have\nto worry about\nburning any matches like i just stay on\nthis group and then i can recover\nfor a while which is what ended up\nhappening\nuh the group here sort of settled down\nthis was the easiest part of the race\nso what are we like almost four hours in\nbefore we really started\nsort of had a recovery period\nall right so we only have 35 miles left\nto go\nwe're four hours 23 minutes into this i\nthink i'm about top\n40 going into an another pretty\ntechnical gravel section\nand the trek rider and the stan's no two\nthat's the the leader of the the women's\ndivision\nthose two were so strong i mean they\nwere pushing the pace\nuh this trek guy was just like\nhands down the strongest in the group\nbut what was so crazy is\nyou know because i think it's so flat\nand there's a lot of wind\nuh it was really hard to get away from\nanyone i mean you could spend\nso much energy on the front and really\ndo no damage\nand so i'm trying to just stay with\nthese guys i popped another ketone\nyou know so i did 30 milligrams at the\nstart then i did another 30 milligrams\naround this point\nso i'm feeling really good you can see\nhere she's the leader of the the female\ndivision the women division and right\nthere she's like slipping and spinning\nand i saw a lot of people doing that um\nmaybe just not the right gearing or just\nbeing\nover twerked on some of these uh\nslippery climbs and\nnot that she doesn't know how to write\ngravel i'm just saying in general\nthere is a skill set to knowing how to\napply power\nto gravel roads and how to climb\nwhere you're not just using raw power or\ntorque and being really efficient\nso i got through there i got through\nthat section\nthere were some pretty difficult times\nbut\ni made it i'm so excited i'm so stoked\non where i am and how i'm feeling\nwe are headed into the hardest part of\nthe ride which is this big\nsandy climb everyone here is kind of\npace lining a little bit\neveryone's you know maybe 70\nin i mean we're wanting to catch as many\npeople as we can\nbut no one's really trying to completely\nempty the tank\nthere's a big road section and a bit of\na climb we had a tailwind section here\nand if everyone really wanted to empty\nthe tank i think we could have made up a\nlot of time here\nbut pretty much everyone wanted to just\nstay on wheels i know i did i wanted to\nsave as much as i could coming up to the\nmain\nclimb lucas he had crashed um\nand so he was out of the front group\nwhich is a bummer we're all kind of just\ngetting ready for the next and hardest\npart of the race\nall right so going into the big climb\nthe hardest section on this course\nuh we're about five hours in only 18\nmiles left i had to stop and get some\nuh some food and some fuel this was the\nfirst rest stop that i\nstopped at and velofix here he got me\ndownloaded with a bottle\nnow they made a change last minute that\nyou could have personal support\nwhich really made it for a lot of\nhitters or people who\nhad a lot of support out here to have\nquite an advantage\nbecause you didn't have to stop at the\nrest stops you had people all over the\nplace\nand and due to kova they just thought\nlike that's a better way to do it is to\nhave your own personal support than\neveryone\nhanging out at a rest stop um so for the\nmost part i\nbrought enough fuel with me to get me to\nthis point and so i hadn't had to use\nany public rest stops\num until that one and i grabbed like i\neight sis gels and i had that one bottle\nfrom velofix that he gave me\nand so the sis gels are really thin like\nthe viscosity is\nvery watery and so even though i didn't\nhave a ton of water at this point\num i could use those gels almost to\nhydrate myself as well\nbut this climb is so sandy it's so steep\nit was\nreally hot it was really strange to go\nfrom like 35 in the morning to right\nhere it felt like a thousand degrees\nand there's there's just no way you're\ngonna find\nsome big effort inside of you it's just\nmore about\nnot completely blowing up because\nthere's a couple sections on this where\nit's so\nsandy and so steep that you're having to\ndo four 500 watts just to stay upright\nand so you know if you are in the red\nand you get to a point where you can no\nlonger sustain that\nand if you unclipped and had to walk it\nwould be real\nyou could lose a minute you could lose\ntwo minutes you could lose so much time\nand just i guess mentally be so cracked\nso i just sort of held you know high\nzone three\nlow zone four feeling really good at\nthis climb\nuh knowing that what's coming next is a\nbig downhill and that single track\nand so this is it this is the final run\nin\nuh we're 14 miles left to go we've got\na good size downhill and then that crazy\nsingle track\nand so until this point i feel like my\ntire choice had been spot on like it was\nreally good it was super fast\nit was a little hard to control in some\npoints but ultimately i think it was the\nfastest setup\ncoming down into this section and\nespecially the single track\ni should have stopped and at the top and\nmaybe let some pressure out\ni think if i let some pressure out i\ncould have actually went\nfive minutes faster in this last section\njust because\nyou know of how it was really hard to\ncontrol this\nsandy section we i did that twice in our\npre-ride so i kind of knew a little bit\nabout this section\nalso at this point i was more afraid of\na mechanical\nso close to the finish than really\nimproving my position\nuh you know i mean i'm not gonna catch\nanyone in front\nit's just more about not losing any\npositions\nin the group that we're in and so we\nkind of had this group of\na few people you know not full gas\nracing but just kind of staying together\nlet's get to the single track together\nlet's go down these\nthese hills let's keep it safe and so\nyou know we're headed towards\nthat single track and uh\ni think we have maybe a group of like\nsix here and i can't see really anyone\nup the road so i have no idea\nyou know if we're even gonna catch\nanyone or not and again like i said\nright here\ni should have aired down if i had\ndropped 20 psi\nright here even though i feel like oh\ni'm gonna stop and i'm gonna lose all\nthis time\ni would have gained it would have been\nit would have been huge\nit would have been so much better\nbecause at least in the beginning\nit wasn't so bad but the end of this\nsingle track is\nso rocky and bumpy that\ni mean it was almost like i was on a\npogo stick i kept coming unclipped um\nit was almost impossible to control the\nbike i was getting really frustrated\nit was like i hit every single possible\nrock\nwhich was kind of a bummer and so then\nthe two guys in the blue and\nyellow and the stan's no tubes\nuh woman they kind of they were gone\num i was stuck behind this guy for a\nlittle bit he let me buy\nand i thought i was gonna catch those\nother people but again like i said the\n50 psi was\nnot good for this single track great for\neverything else not good here\nnow unfortunately my gopro dies uh i\ni had three batteries on me and somehow\nthey just\nall popped out it was really bump anyway\nlost my batteries\nand so i couldn't change my battery for\nthe fin the finish\ni don't have the finish on film\nwhich is super irritating um but so we\ncome out of the single track\nand there's about i have a group of like\nfour or five\nand it was really fast through like\nthese little\num walk paths and and bike paths and so\nhere's kind of the reenactment of the\nfinish is that we come\nin to the final sprint we've got lucas\non the front we've got\ni'm on the back of this group here and\nuh\nthis guy in the y he takes off he's\nsprinting i wish i had this on footage\nbecause i'm staying on his wheel\nand the last minute i actually out\nsprinted someone\ni won the pack sprint out of the group\nthat we were with then i did a wheelie\nand then i did a backflip and then i\nturned into a banana i have no footage\nof it but trust me it's what happened\nso my finish time was six hours 34\nminutes that's 39 minutes off of first\nuh the winner's time was five hours 55\nminutes\nwhich is honestly almost exactly\ni think i was 40 minutes off of first\nuh last year at belgian waffle so but i\ndid get\n26th overall sixth in my age group\nmy normalized power for the whole six\nhours 34 minutes was\n245 watts that's 3.5 watts per kilo\nnormalized\nthat's a lot uh energy wise i burned\n5000 calories\nyou know had a huge day on the bike and\nlook there's no vegan excuses because i\nrode to the best of my potential\ni only have vegan excuses when something\nhappens that stops me from\ndoing what i know i could have done my\npower\nmy energy my the way i rode physically\nwas about as the best i could have\nexpected\nand so i can't be down about that at all\nmy boy travis\nyou know he was drives all the way out\nhere this was a big event for him he was\nready for it he had trained for it\nand then he had no luck uh cole kessler\nalso super strong no luck i mean there\nwere so many people\nthat had so many issues and\ni didn't have any of those issues right\ni mean i had my own little issues\nbut nothing that stopped me from being\nthe best i could physically be and i\nknow i make a lot of excuses sometimes\nbut the thing is that i don't care if i\nget\nlast place if i get lapped a hundred\ntimes\nin a one mile crit if i did the best i\nknow i\nphysically could do that if i lived up\nto my potential\ni'm always going to be happy with that\nand so with\nhow much this trip cost and how much\ntime we put into it and how i was away\nfrom my family for so long\nthere was a lot of pressure to not\ncompletely suck\nand so to do better than i did last year\nso bwr i got 40th last year was one of\nmy most proudest results\nand then to get 26th here this year um\nto do well\ni am i'm just super proud of it man i'm\nsuper stoked on this\nand again maybe in the beginning i could\nhave done a little more to\nhave been further up the road\nbut if i was with that front group i\njust can't imagine\nthat i could have stayed with them given\nhow hard i had to ride\nfor 26th place the amount of support\nthat i got from\ncanyon from irc from elio\nuh was huge uh so i just want to say a\nhuge thank you to those guys\nand just the event you know michael\nmarks he puts on a phenomenal event\nthe belgian waffle like ethos is just\nyou know the hardest one day ride uh\never and it just lives up to that i mean\nthis course was phenomenal it was one of\nmy favorite courses i've ever ridden\nbecause there wasn't any huge um\nphysical deciders until the very end so\nyou could if you had some technical\nskills and you had some good base\nfitness\nyou could feel competitive all the way\ninto that last climb\nand so i thought it was a really fair\nand and like overall\ngood course can't wait to do it next\nyear guys i hope you enjoyed the video\num i'm really proud of this result if\nyou want to go back and watch the four\ndays leading up to this i\ndaily vlogged you know our little trip\nleading into this\nand as always guys vegan cyclists",

It is a beautiful ride and very, very curvy. The only thing I didn't like is there are a lot of blind curves and hills that prevent you from seeing what is ahead or oncoming vehicles. But as you will see from the video, other cars aren't a problem. At least not this day. I'm also going to upload the full video I hope. But it is a lot longer.
