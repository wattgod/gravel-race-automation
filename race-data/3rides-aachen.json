The CHIO Gelände venue sits in the tri-border region flatlands of Germany, Belgium, and Netherlands.

Lower altitude than Gravel Worlds — no thin-air concerns."

The mix of forest paths, meadows, and technical sections in the Sauerland creates exploration beyond typical gravel road racing."

          "description": "Chaotic day out in Germany.\nMixed startboxes, late start, cars on the track, .... It was quite an experience.\nBut in the end it was fun and the crowd was amazing!\n\nI arrived at 11.10am and was allready at the back of the startbox. Due to mixing men, women and 2 age groups there were A LOT of riders in 1 box. A big mess during the start and after a few miles we already were passing slower riders from earlier starts.\nEverything came a couple of times to a complete stop due to bottlenecks on the track.\n\nIn this chaos I had no idea what my postion was. I thought it was around 50th place but apparantly it was +100!\n\nIn the last lap I gave it my all and placed some attacks on technical sections and downhills.\nGained 40 places and ended up as 62th out of 192 riders in M40-44 group.\n4 mins too slow for a worlds qualification.\nNext try in Houffalize.",

          "description": "My first gravel race - and somehow started in the front of my starting block at a world series race (420 riders just in my age group). Got passed by around 150 riders in the first 19 minutes, which has put me right in the middle of the field, where I also mostly stayed for the time in this video.\n\nHad my last sip of water at 1h5min, right before the PRO men caught up to us (started 10min behind). The rest of my liquids I carried was just concentrated calories and electrolytes (useless without water), so with the high humidity (you see my sweat dripping from my head in the video), it went downhill from there. I was waiting for the official water stations but did not see them or I must have blindly passed them. Right when the GoPro battery died, something pulled the plug for my body as well, riding until 60k at literal recovery pace, so slow that I wasn't even granted the second lap (as well as 100+ other riders).\n\nMy mind said not to do the race because I'm still out of shape, but I felt like I'd really enjoy a fast group ride with others on my 15 year old cyclocross bike, so I just wanted to have fun. I can't remember the last time I had so much fun as in the first hour of the race - so it was successful. Even though it got cut short and only placing 313th in the 19-34 category. I have to admit I also pushed way too hard the first 30min (got infected with RACE MODE).\n\nConnect with me on social media:\n@NilsReckmeier",
