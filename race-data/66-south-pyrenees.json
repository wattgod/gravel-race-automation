        "explanation": "110km hits the sweet spot for challenging gravel without becoming an endurance death march.

Multiple distance choices prevent the race from being a one-dimensional sufferfest, though none approach epic proportions."

Terrain \"plays with your nerves\" but reads more like mountain fire roads than technical gravel challenges."

        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "2,134m over 110km delivers Pyrenees climbing with three major ascents including a two-step monster from km 72-87. Racing between 1600-2000m altitude adds respiratory stress to the physical demands. Even the 74km option packs 1,462m of climbing—this race earns every meter of vertical."

        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "September in the Pyrenees offers stable weather windows, though mountain conditions change rapidly at racing altitude of 1600-2000m. Mandatory warm and waterproof clothing requirements suggest organizers expect temperature swings and potential weather exposure during the event."
      },
      "altitude": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Racing between 1600-2000m provides noticeable but manageable altitude effects, with routes peaking at 2,400m featuring \"rocky trails and forest paths.\" High enough to feel lung burn on climbs through Scots pine forests around Formiguères station, not high enough to require serious acclimatization."

      "adventure": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Route explores varied terrain through Capcir, Formiguères, and around Lake Calvet with forest trails and rocky paths typical of the southwest Pyrenees. Course climbs \"straight into the slope\" through forest trail to 1,900m, but 108 checkpoints suggests over-managed adventure rather than true exploration."
      },
      "prestige": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "UCI Gravel World Series qualifier status provides credibility with UCI jerseys and Gran Fondo medals for qualifiers. Post-race prize-giving ceremony rewards top 3 overall plus category winners, but this remains a baby race with no legendary winners or established gravel community recognition."
      },
      "race_quality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Well-stocked refreshment stations with zero waste operation and comprehensive safety coverage throughout 108 checkpoints shows organizational competence. Medical assistance and signage included, though on-site only packet pickup and 7 PM same-day cutoff creates logistical stress for participants."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Post-race prize ceremony at 7 PM same day with music evening invitation creates proper celebration atmosphere. Welcome bags for participants and 30% discounts on local activities like Lou Bac Mountain and Angléo Balnéo add value to the village finish experience in Les Angles."
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Regional French cycling culture runs deep, and the race builds on an established road event with local support. Village start/finish in Les Angles creates intimate atmosphere, and the range of distances (20km to 110km) suggests inclusive community building."
      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "UCI qualifier status attracts riders chasing World Championship spots with separate age-group qualification categories (men 60+/women 50+ for 74km option). Time gates enforce competitive standards by stopping riders who miss cutoffs, though field size and notable participants remain unknown."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "€80 for 110km includes timing, aid stations, medal, welcome bag, and 30% discounts on local activities like cable cars and spa access. That's reasonable for European gravel racing, especially with the Pyrenees location. Multiple distance options provide entry points, though the shortest costs €20 for essentially a neighborhood loop."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Les Angles mountain resort location means paying peak season rates with limited lodging options. Mandatory equipment includes hard helmet, repair kit, and weather-appropriate clothing, adding gear costs. The 30% local activity discount helps slightly but you're paying Pyrenees resort pricing."
