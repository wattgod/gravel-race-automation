          "description": "O Alentejo foi palco de uma etapa inesquecível da UCI Gravel World Series, em Ourique (a primeira em Portugal) e estive lá como sempre, dentro da corrida.\n\nNeste vídeo, mostro o lado mais racing do gravel: o pó, o esforço, a adrenalina e a beleza das paisagens alentejanas (que na verdade nem vi bem, hehehe).\n\nUma experiência “inside the race”, onde cada curva conta, e cada subida mostra como o gravel é rápido e tem adrenalina.\n\nSubscreve o canal e ativa o sino das notificações, é grátis, dessa forma já estás ajudar e não perdes as próximas aventuras, testes ou entrevistas.\n\n(Este vídeo demorou oito horas de edição).\n\nObrigado a todos!\n\nImagens de drone e passagens: Paulo Santos\nFoto de capa: Eduardo Campos\n\n#TopCycling #ucigravelworldseries #AlentejoGravel #UCIGRavel #OuriqueGravel #CyclingLife #GravelBike #RideGravel #GravelRacing #BikeAdventure #CyclingPortugal #UCICycling #CyclingCommunity #luisbeltrão #alentejo",

          "description": "EPISÓDIO #100 \n🌄 Uma volta de gravel pelo deslumbrante Alentejo, em Portugal!\n\n😴 Sim, dessa vez não troquei os nomes, pois fica bem mais fácil fazer isso depois de uma noite bem dormida!\n\n🌟 Participar do “Fita Preta Gravel Challenge” foi uma experiência que combina aventura e beleza natural de forma única. À medida que você pedala pelas estradas sinuosas e trilhas rurais fica extremamente cativado pela paisagem intocada do Alentejo.\n\n🌾 Os campos dourados se estendem até onde a vista alcança, pontilhados por vilarejos pitorescos e vinhas que produzem alguns dos melhores vinhos do país.\n\n👨‍🌾 O Alentejo é conhecido por sua autenticidade e hospitalidade calorosa, e ao longo do caminho, você terá a oportunidade de interagir com os habitantes locais que compartilharão histórias e sabores da região.\n\n🌍 Uma volta de bicicleta no Alentejo não é apenas uma jornada física, mas uma jornada sensorial que o conectará profundamente com a beleza e a cultura desta região fascinante de Portugal.\n\n🏞️ O ponto principal de ter participado de um evento competitivo em modo passeio foi ter a oportunidade de passar em locais que estariam fechados ao público nos dias normais.\n\n🍇 Poder adentrar nas quintas particulares só aumentou a vontade de um dia poder ter um cantinho por alí e vivenciar mais momentos como este.\n\n📸 Aqui ficam alguns registros desta aventura e se quiser conferir algumas fotos sugiro que nos visite no instagram @cadeabike\n\n👊🏼Muito obrigado pela companhia dos queridos amigos:\n@fernando.branquinho\n@alexandrecosta1143\n@joframo\n\nE claro, o apoio dos nossos amigos da @ciclobaia\n:.\n.:\n:.\nUm grande abraço para todos.\n\n-Se você curte o meu trabalho e pode colaborar ficarei muito feliz em me convidar para um cafézinho.
