        "explanation": "Spring Valley has extremely limited lodging options - essentially one small hotel. Rochester is 19 miles away with more options due to Mayo Clinic, but Minneapolis airport is 2+ hours away. Nicholas Garbis describes the \"Meteor Theory\" pacing strategy - going \"out hot, hotter than what can be sustained, and then slowly peel back like the edges of a meteor burning off as it enters the Earth's atmosphere.\" The race embodies DIY spirit with no SAG support or aid stations."
      },
      "length": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "At 100 miles (actually 101), the flagship distance is substantial and puts it firmly in the challenging-but-not-ultra category. Brad Patty averaged 207.6W for 6-7 hours at 15.4 mph overall, maintaining remarkably consistent power throughout with hourly breakdowns showing 195-216W averages. The 162-mile Royal and 380-mile Alexander options push into extreme territory for those seeking more punishment. Longer than Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego. As Brad Patty puts it: \"I knew from previous long hard-surface rides that I could maintain around 200 watts average power for over 5 hours.\""
      },
      "technicality": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Mixed terrain includes well-maintained gravel, freshly laid loose stone, packed dirt, broken pavement, and creek crossings. JOM reports the road surface as \"hard pack limestone base with smattering of gravel atop and sandy bits\" that drains well. At mile 27 \"gravel was deep in places,\" and the second-half transition to energy-sapping fresh stone adds significant technical challenge before the infamous Oriole Road climb at mile 90. Similar technical demands to Gravel Worlds."
      },
      "elevation": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Approximately 7,500 feet of climbing over 100 miles through the Driftless Region's rolling terrain. The course follows a familiar pattern: \"downhill, valley, river, bridge, then uphill, open rolling plateau of farmland, downhill.\" Brad Patty found \"my legs were starting to have less snap at mile 70 and by mile 90 I was in full conserve mode flirting with cramps.\" The relentless nature of Driftless climbing makes every foot count. Similar elevation profile to Gravel Worlds."
      },
      "climate": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "May in Minnesota is weather roulette ranging from 30s to 80s Fahrenheit. The 2017 'Al-monsoon-zo' brought 40°F temperatures with driving rain - Hypno Toad reported \"steady 15 mph wind with gusts up to 25 mph. Rain never really stopped and temps might have gotten up to 50°F.\" The 2021 edition hit low 90s with 25mph winds, causing 350 registered riders to drop to only 150 who actually showed up. Milder conditions than Crusher in the Tushar."
      },
      "altitude": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "The Driftless Region sits at relatively low elevation (roughly 800-1,400 feet above sea level). Altitude is not a factor in this race - your legs will suffer from the gravel and climbing, not from thin air. Lower altitude than Gravel Worlds — no thin-air concerns."
      },
      "adventure": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "This is a pilgrimage for gravel purists through the stunning Driftless Region with towering bluffs, Amish farms, and Forestville State Park. During one edition, \"horses broke free and ran with the racers for a few miles. It was amazing.\" Riders report seeing \"painted horses, a giant turkey, a hawk of some sort, a humongous Bernese mountain dog\" and other wildlife. Nathan G. O'Brien described the experience as \"Physically, is it the hardest thing I've ever done? Quite possibly yes.\""
      },
      "prestige": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "The Almanzo 100 is widely recognized as 'The Granddaddy of All Gravel Races' - the event that helped kickstart the entire movement. Chris Skogen is in the Gravel Cycling Hall of Fame, and the Salsa Warbird and Challenge Almanzo tire were literally named after this race. As one observer noted, \"Fortunately only a small handful of riders deem the free-to-enter, no prizes given, Almanzo 100 worth winning,\" highlighting its cultural rather than commercial significance."
      },
      "race_quality": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "This is a grassroots, free event with zero frills - and that's entirely by design. No aid stations, no SAG support, navigation by cue cards only. The organizational history has been turbulent with multiple transitions between Chris Skogen, Spring Valley Tourism, and now split between the Heywood Ride and Spring Valley 100. Multiple riders reported getting lost due to thin fields and unclear marking, but the ethos remains admirably DIY."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "The race experience is authentic and memorable in ways modern commercialized events cannot replicate. Tim Savre calls it \"The 'fun gravel ride' that always turns out to be one of the hardest days of the year on the bike.\" Nathan G. O'Brien consumed everything from \"six liters of water\" to \"enough dirt to cough up a sand castle big enough for Peter Dinklage to live in\" during his 12-hour finish, capturing the raw, unfiltered nature of the event."
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 5,
        "explanation": "This is where gravel culture was born. Cherry Grove checkpoint volunteers served \"35 pounds of bacon, pickles wrapped in salami, asparagus, beer, soda, Fireball whiskey, Jack Daniel's, pickle juice\" to riders. Ross, the community center caretaker, gathered 30 lbs of wild asparagus and served it fresh-cooked while collecting rider autographs on poster boards. The community is passionate, authentic, and welcoming in a way that corporate events cannot match."
      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Without professional timing, prize money, or series affiliation, the Almanzo doesn't attract top pro fields. Dee Dee Winfield won the 2018 women's race on an old cantilever Blue Norcross SL cyclocross bike with clincher tires and tubes. Matt Allen raced on his vintage steel Medici Gran Turismo courier bike with \"gravel tires in 28mm with tubes.\" The competition is regional at best - dedicated amateurs and gravel pilgrims rather than elite professionals. Less competitive depth than Atlas Mountain Race."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 5,
        "explanation": "FREE. The entry fee is literally zero dollars - always has been, always will be. You register by mailing a postcard, a charmingly old-school process that Chris Skogen started specifically as a rejection of 'pay-to-play events.' In an era of $200+ race entries, this represents unbeatable value for a 100-mile race that costs nothing to enter. Even the legendary Cherry Grove aid station with its 35 pounds of bacon comes at no additional cost."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "With free entry, your only costs are travel and lodging. Nicholas Garbis ran Panaracer Gravelking SK 700c x 35mm tires at \"35psi front / 38psi rear\" while Brad Patty used a PowerCal heart rate-based power meter he found \"very accurate compared to the PowerTap hub.\" From the Midwest, this is extremely budget-friendly - drive in, stay at a cheap hotel in Rochester or Spring Valley, race for free, drive home with minimal gear requirements. More affordable than Crusher in the Tushar."
