The three-day format delivers proper stage race volume—4,790m total elevation across 270km separates this from single-day events. Longer than Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

      "technicality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Stage 1's muddy 70km course around Vielsalm shows conditions can get messy, but the terrain remains typical Belgian Ardennes rolling hills and forest paths. Trouwborst's early Stage 3 puncture required \"a plug and a few pumps\" to reach tech support—challenging but manageable difficulty. Less technical than The Mid South."

That's 4,790m total elevation—steady Ardennes rollers that hurt without breaking you, peaking around Baraque Fraiture's higher terrain. Similar elevation profile to Gravel Worlds."
      },
      "climate": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Late September conditions turned Stage 1 into a \"muddy course\" that affected elite tactics, with Trouwborst taking early control in the slick conditions. Belgian Ardennes shoulder season means 50-65°F temps with rain odds that can make gravel technical when wet. Similar climate challenges to SBT GRVL."

        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "The Ardennes barely reaches 2,300 feet at Baraque Fraiture, with stages starting much lower around Vielsalm and Engreux. Zero altitude considerations needed—this is sea-level racing with hills, not mountain suffering. Lower altitude than Gravel Worlds — no thin-air concerns."

        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Multi-day stage racing through Wallonian forests with different daily start locations (Vielsalm, Centre Adeps d'Engreux, Baraque Fraiture) creates proper adventure variety. The format tests \"endurance, technique, and spirit\" across the Ardennes' dramatic landscapes over three distinct stages."

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Elite racer Mariëlle Trouwborst used this as \"good preparation for the World Gravel Championships,\" showing it attracts serious competitors.

        "explanation": "Stage 2 doubled as the final round of the Dusty Gravel series, bringing additional competitive depth beyond the stage race field. Real mass-start racing with proper timing, but mechanical issues cost Trouwborst the queen stage win, suggesting technical support could improve."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Trouwborst's overall victory despite Stage 2 mechanicals and early Stage 3 puncture shows the format rewards consistency over single-stage heroics. Camping access, bike wash service, and Sunday pasta party hit the gravel adventure checklist for the full weekend experience."
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Organizers recommend the full weekend to \"fully experience the unique Ardenne Gravel Stages\" rather than cherry-picking days. Mixed gender start times and flexible 1-3 day entry options welcome different commitment levels, while the camping setup encourages socializing."

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Elite winner Trouwborst lost Stage 2 to Joyce Vanderbeken, showing competitive depth at the front. However, recreational 1-day options starting at 29€ and the Dusty Gravel integration suggest a mixed field of serious racers and weekend warriors. Less competitive depth than Almanzo 100."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "149€ for three days including meals, camping, bike wash, and secure parking competes well with single-day European events. The inaugural format as Belgium's first three-day gravel stage race adds uniqueness value, while 1-day options at 29-49€ offer affordable entry points."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Registration runs €150-250. Belgian Ardennes tourist areas like Vielsalm and Engreux punish wallets for lodging beyond included camping. Limited lodging available at Centre Adeps d'Engreux for multi-stage participants, but no airport logistics support leaves international travelers figuring out connections solo. Higher total cost than Badlands."
