          "description": "To simply finish the Atlas Mountain Race means navigating 1,200 kilometres of the most rugged and remote roads in Morocco. To win requires riding almost non-stop, night and day, for days on end. It is a combination of strength and sleep deprivation that only a few riders in the world can manage. Alone, unsupported and loaded down with supplies, each competitor must constantly battle mechanicals, heat exhaustion and saddle sores to get to the finish. There is no prize, no money, simply the satisfaction that comes from pushing oneself to the limit while exploring the forgotten corners of a beautiful country.\n\nWith support from PEdALED, Canyon, Fizik and the race crew led by organiser and route creator Nelson Trees, filmmaker Brady Lawrence followed the race documenting everything from a brutal 80 kilometre walk through the high desert with a broken bike, to one racer’s simple joy at realising they’ll soon eat their first warm meal in days. Featuring the sport’s biggest names and first-time, ultra-distance racers alike, the film gets up close to the kind of people crazy enough to take on this epic challenge. Capturing the human drama set against an otherworldly landscape, Into the Rift is an in-depth look at a true cycling adventure.",

little sleep as I\ncan we get up really early every morning\nstart applauding and then the Sun comes\nup and all the boys come screaming past\nme and then they go to bed early and\nthey have a nice long sleep so I just\nkeep going and that's how we keep the\nsame pace going downhill I think we're\nin cp3 which I am led to believe is the\nlast checkpoint but I don't actually\nreally yep last checkpoint one more\nstamp to collect according to this five\ndays three hours into the race my goal\nwas always just to finish and like I'm\nnot a very competitive person so my goal\nwas always just to finish and I never I\ndon't look at the dots ever so I don't\nlet myself get caught up in that but\nobviously since the first day people\nhave been come out to me and tell me\nthat I'm in first place and obviously\nthat's starting to seep in now I'm at\nthe last checkpoint like I'm starting to\nbe willing to admit to myself that I do\nreally want it you know I've held on to\nit for this long maybe be nice thing to\nto win but I'm never really what the\nother girls do really well so I'm not\nvery good at competing\nyou can do this you are alive I need a\nno no no but I need afar it's crazy when\nyou can smell yourself during the climb\nit's too late\nbe it on the fifth day of racing or even\nthe first the moment will arrive when\nthings begin to unravel mechanicals\nsaddle sores dehydration sleep\ndeprivation\nto succeed in this race your bike your\nbody and your mind all have to stay\ntogether long enough to cross the finish\nline three days we've had some crazy\nmechanical like five flats one I had it\nso the split so I blew up so I had it so\nthe tire together two hours yeah I took\nmy shirt and I took the thread for Mike\nand I main thread because we didn't\nbring you down a flux this time free hot\nnews gonna be really hard but I think a\nlot of people probably underestimated\nthis course and once you're out there\nyou realize how slow tracking it is and\nhow you had this intention to maybe\nfinishing a little shorter time than you\nreally can raw ass sore hands and feet\nyou know stuff like that but um that's\nto be expected with this type of\nadventure\nyou play music for me buddy that genie\nthank you for a long bike so many\npunches must be double figures now\nthat's going by extra shoobs sitting the\nbar last night fixing tubes it's taking\na while\na road trip tonight last night which is\nprobably stupid but I didn't want to\nstop was too cold hands to take my\nsleeping snowshoes\ndérailleur came loose oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]\nmanaged to ride with it loose so I had\nenough gears to just get by\nand then finally came off in the\ndownhill we can see how this has been\nlike from the torque when it was a\nsingle speed this gots jammed and you're\nso hard that it bent\nwe had to I had bent it a little bit to\ntry to break this chain out but it's\nlike it's basically taking away now four\ngears but then I have to figure out I've\ngot 200 K to go on a bike that doesn't\nhave a chain\nyou imagine like a house brick and you\ntake five health brick you keep one as\nit is then the second one you break it\ninto two the third one you break it into\nthree and inform five smashing and like\nthat's that's what the road was for a\nday we were talking about I thought I\nwas gonna die because like moving this\ndown rocks moving a piano maybe no one\nwas it's not good for your digestion\nthat's all I can say though we have we\nhave food together today darling see\nhost on this is today four days it's\ntables are pretty good yeah four days\nit's a momentous occasion I was almost\ntempted photo it and I keep it potatoes\nI did that will be a step too far I went\nto blog\nnow I'm with ya I would say actually\nalthough it was I've had some lows you\nknow very funny as well like even if\nyou're like just dip your arrives in the\ntown you see all these kind of aliens\nlike me on drugs\none big ecstasy find him\n200 K old road with just one night left\nof racing James is slowly closing the\ngap to sofyan if one of them cracks or\nhas to sleep it could be the difference\nbetween victory and second place\nJames has one final shot to try and take\nthe lead\nat the front of the race Sufjan is still\nmoving after 87 hours of riding and\nnumber two hours of sleep is finally\nstarting to show cracks in his armor\nhonestly no idea this week this is gonna\ntake so long today yeah today's\nway slower than I expected\nas soufiane White's day breaks and James\nHayden makes it across the line\na mere two hours later I never seen so\nmany people\nyeah\nthe Sun passes high noon and jp2 vari\nenters what will become one of the most\ninfamous sections of the course\nfirst hand who's not gravel in this\ncountry\nit's either rock boulders or huge stones\nor you're on pavement\nso you either go fast or you go slow\nwhile the top three finishers catch up\non some much-needed sleep and there's\nayman of Germany breaks camp early after\nalmost no rest\nshe has been slowly gaining ground on\nJenny tough and as the race comes to a\nclose she finds herself full of energy\nand within striking distance of winning\nI didn't hack it I tried to go through\nthe night\nI didn't it's about to go down there's\nlike massive not like descent but I\ncan't keep my eyes open and they I take\nconsequences so it's not for a couple\nhours\nless than 100 kilometers from the finish\njenny realizes when her brief sleepers\ncustom he puts in one last push to try\nand seal her victory just before being\nstopped in her tracks

          "transcript": "hey everybody Neil belenko here and\ntoday we're going to do something a\nlittle different so I've been scouring\nover the rigs of submitted for the Atlas\nmountain race and I've definitely kind\nof collected a bunch of stats as you can\nsee here stats about bikes bike type um\ntires bike packing bags and so much more\nso in this video we're going to kind of\nunpack all of these stats and share them\nwith you let's do\nit\n[Music]\nall right so the Atlas mountain race\nstarts today at 6 p.m. and Racers are\nset to take on the fourth edition of the\nrace so this year uh the racers will\ntravel 800 mil or 1300 km from marash to\nasua in Morocco it has turned into one\nof the probably the top five most\npopular self-supported Ultra endurance\nraces in the world and it definitely\nshows with over 100 rigs submitted uh\nand obviously 300 plus participants so\nlet's just dive right into it but before\nwe do I just want to take a quick moment\nto let you all know that this video is\npartially supported by tailin tailin\ndesigns and Engineers technical bike\npacking equipment for almost any kind of\nAdventure Innovation and quality are at\nthe heart of what makes them tick and\ntheir constant strive to create better\nperforming gear means that you can focus\non enjoying the ride they offer a range\nof options from hauling your gear\nwhether you're taking on a big event\nlike the Atlas mountain race or just\nescaping for an overnighter so for more\non tailin you can click on this card in\nthe top right corner or find the link\nbelow so we did this exact same thing\nfor the tour divide last year and if you\nwant to watch that you can find it in\nthe description below obviously the tour\ndivide is a much longer race but the\nAtlas mountain race is certainly rougher\naround the edges and simply put more\nTechnical and looking at a few folks\nthat actually raced the tour divide this\npast year and are also doing the Atlas\nmountain race such as 2023 tour divide\nwinner rri Bartholomew and runner up\njustinus Leva uh rri is sticking with\nthe same drop bar BMC while justinus is\ngoing for a bit more Comfort using a\nfull suspension cross country mountain\nbike all right so speaking of handlebars\nhere uh 83 of the 105 rigs actually came\nwith flat bars which definitely\nshowcases kind of that technical level\nof the overall route uh and as far as\nArrow bars are concerned the majority of\nfolks are actually using Arrow bars with\n69 of them uh using them and 36 deciding\nnot to all right so of the 105 rigs\nsubmitted to us 90 have suspension forks\non their bikes with only three flat bar\nrigs us using rigid forks and of the 22\ndrop bar rigs 10 are actually using\nsuspension forks and there are also 19\nfull suspension mountain bikes in the\nlist and that does not include uh the\nTrek Pro calibers or the Lee hugan\nRampage in Nova uh those soft tails\nwhich totaled seven speaking of the bike\nbrands there were actually quite a few\ndifferent types 46 different bike brands\nwere represented but there were\ndefinitely some prominent names among\nthose Brands uh including there were 12\nTRS eight specialized eight Canyons\nseven Salsas and canondale Mason and orb\neach had five and Scott had four and\nthere was one beautiful tandem this\nsalsa Powder Keg with SNS couplers I\ndon't know how they do it it's pretty\nimpressive all right so moving on to\ntires and well there were 12 different\ntire brands represented here and seven\nuh different tire sizes so for starters\nthe most popular Tire size was either\nthe 2.2 or 2.25 in tire size with 54\nfolks using that size followed by 2.3 or\n2.35 in at 32 individuals there were six\nfolks using 2.4 in tires five using 2.1\nin tires three using uh 2in or narrower\ntires and only three people were also\nusing 2.6 in tires where which uh\ndefinitely was surprising on my end and\nyes 29 plus is not dead but pretty close\nwe have one person using a plus bike\nwith 3in tires all right so regarding\ntire brands it's clear that folks really\nlove the Victoria Mescal um and I\nactually used them all of last year and\nit is a super fast rolling tire and\nthat's probably why people are using\nthem but uh I definitely didn't love\nthem a ton when it came to the rough\nstuff I'm surprised it's used so much\nbecause of that uh the breaking and\ncornering definitely left something to\nbe desired but I guess if you're racing\nyou want a fast rolling Tire anyo 30 36\nfolks use some sort of Victoria Tire\ncombination most were using full Mescal\nsets or BTO Mescal combos there were\nalso 25 folks using Maxis tires uh be it\nardant Recon Recon race or icons\nfollowed by 10 Continental Tires mostly\nrace Kings eight schwabe uh seven\nparelli uh scorpions which actually\nlooks like a pretty sweet Tire seven\nRene airs uh fleecer Ridge tires and a\ncollection of others and while I could\nhave missed a few I actually only\ncounted three folks using the 27.5 in\nwheel diameter which certainly seemed a\nlittle surprising but maybe maybe 27.5\nis dead I don't know and if you were all\nwondering I counted 21 tan sidewalls\njust for reference all right so as far\nas the drivetrains are concerned similar\nto the tour divide it's evident that\nthere is a monopoly of sorts you just go\ndown the list here and you're going to\nsee Shimano and TR and that's about it\nShram had the most at 60 drivers\nfollowed by 41 Shimano drivers one\nsingle speeder is out there which is\nkind of surprising to see so little\nthere's one rolloff Hub and one 13-speed\ncampy driver so speaking of speeds most\nusers were actually rocking a one by and\nmost of those one buys wore 12 speeds\nbut there were 10 11speed drivers one of\nwhich was a 2X 11 and there were two 10\nspeed cassettes being used uh one was\nused with a two by and that tandem that\nalso Powder Keg uh has a three by up\nfront so like the tour divide rigs\nelectronic shifting H it's pretty\npopular although it's certainly not the\nmajority with only 37 of the 105 systems\nusing batteries I only saw actually two\nShimano di2 systems and both of those\nwere the grx systems and all of the\nremaining electronic systems were stram\naccess with nine of those being the new\nEagle Transmission system overall\nnothing out of the ordinary here but\nit's definitely clear that shrams\nelectronic system is trusted even after\na few of the systems failed in the tour\ndivide last year including Second Place\nTour divide finisher justinus had both a\nbattery fail him and his derailer by the\nend of the race so when I started my\nrole uh in let's call it bike packing\njournalism 10 years ago or so one of the\nmain goals was to highlight bike packing\nbag makers tremendous kind of efforts uh\nwhich I still do today it truly makes\nour little bike industry tick and makes\neach bike super unique so the results\nfrom the Atlas mountain race uh were\npretty interesting as far as bike\npacking bags were concerned there were\nnot many completely outfitted kits from\njust one brand which I think is pretty\ncool uh there were 74 individuals using\na mix of brands brands for their bikee\npacking bag kits whereas the remaining\nindividuals were loyal to one specific\nbrand of those Brands apidura ruled with\nnine full kits followed by rrap at 7even\nand tailin at 5 so the majority of\nracers were rocking uh seat packs and\nthis is always something curious to me\n74 in total with 20 folks using the\ntailin arrow pack system and six using a\nrack and dry bag and of course there\nwere four folks not using a seat pack or\nanything back there at all go fast carry\nnothing yeah something like that and I\nthink it's worth mentioning this new\nkind of tailin Arrow pack system looks\nreally unique uh a little bit more\nminimalist so I definitely look forward\nto hearing a little bit more about that\nall right so finally getting into the\ndemographics 22 countries were\nrepresented in our Rigs of series uh\nwith the most in the UK region\nrepresenting uh 23 in individuals second\nwas France with 177 individuals followed\nby Belgium with nine Germany with eight\nand Italy with six it's also awesome to\nsee one individual from Morocco itself\nalso as far as the ages uh I think this\nis pretty telling the 30 to 39 age group\noccupied the most individuals at 45 with\n40 to 49 being next with 23 then the 50\nto 59 age group with 15 20 to 29 with 14\nfolks two individuals at 60 plus one\nunder 20 and four folks that did not put\ntheir age in this is a pretty inline\nwith the tour divide numbers that we got\nfrom last year however uh the 60s group\nin the tour divide was much higher and\nthere's only two in the Atlas mountain\nrace pretty interesting a few other\nfindings that I noticed were that\ndropper posts were not very popular at\nall with only 14 droppers among the\ngroup I find this pretty surprising but\nseat bags were mostly used used and most\nare not dropper friendly so there may be\nsome correlation there I also only\ncounted nine suspension seat posts with\nmost of them being of the Cane Creek\nvariety and roughly half of the group is\nrocking Dynamo hubs with 51 folks and\nspeaking of recharging eight individuals\nwe're using the new Garmin Edge 840 or\n1040 solar GPS units which is really\ninteresting because well I've personally\nreally loved the product and it makes a\nlot of sense for Ultras but we'll see\nhow it actually works out for them all\nright so that about does it did anything\nstand out to you let us know in the\ncomment section below and we are going\nto do a follow-up survey to all of these\nRacers so stay tuned uh to that after\nthe

          "transcript": "it's 4:30 in the\nmorning on Thursday\nmorning and I'm currently hiking my bike\nup an unridable Trail somewhere outside\nof Ager in\nMorocco I've been living on about 2 and\n1/2 3 hours sleep T night last four\nnights been wearing the same kit for the\nlast 5\ndays I smell\nterrible outlas Mountain\nrace what an\nexperience the Atlas Mountains the\nlargest and most formidable mountain\nrange in Northern Africa\n2,500 km of Peaks and valleys gorges and\nplains reaching from Central morocc\nacross Algeria and into\nTunisia the range separates the\nMediterranean and Atlantic coastlines\nfrom the deserts of the Sahara it is not\nthe kind of place one immediately thinks\nto ride a\nbike my name is Tristan kaju I'm a\nphotographer and cyclist from Sydney\nAustralia now living in Jona Spain I've\nwon races trained with the world's top\nprofessional cyclists and spend a\nmajority of my year riding on the roads\nof catalunia I'd never considered doing\nin Ultra until I heard about the Atlas\nmountain race a\n1,173 km epic it begins in Marakesh and\nheads East into the mountains before\nheading south and west and finally\nfinishing in agader on the Atlantic\ncoast three staffed checkpoints very\nlittle resupply and a fixed rout\nAdventure that grabbed my attention and\nwouldn't let go this is my story of the\nAtlas mountain race 2022\n[Music]\nkeeps of rain this\ntime that's\nexactly so damn\ngood 18\n20%\nblock so much fun get real old real\nquick when you got to wrist\nall righty Bon De and welcome to today's\nepisode of Tristan take video this is a\nsuper special one the date is the first\nof October 2022 and today I'm in\nMarakesh Morocco and I'm about to kick\noff the Atlas mountain race Atlas\nmountain race is a gravel and mountain\nbike race that I got my entry to over 2\nyears ago now and it's been postponed\nthree times since it was meant to go\nahead in February 2021 and then it got\npostponed to October then it got\npostponed February 2022 and now it's\nbeen postponed all the way through until\nOctober 2022 and today we have finally\narrived we start here in Marakesh and we\nend in agader whenever you end in agader\nit's a single stage race so there's no\nspecific spots where you need to stop\nyou just keep going and you stop\nwhenever you like carry everything you\nneed with you it's unsupported so I'm\nabout to go and have breakfast I'm about\nto get ready and uh then I'm going to\nhead off to the start line I hope you\nguys enjoy this one let's go and do it\nall\nall righty first\nupdate uh 34 km in I was about 8 km in\njust after the neutral when everyone\nstarted pushing when uh I realized I\nhadn't turned my spot tracker on so\nlesson number one that I've learned I'm\nso not used to turning on a spot tracker\nI do all the other things at the start\nof my ride usually in a bit of a a\nritual of formula and then I completely\nforgot to turn on the spot tracker so\nturned that on but then it wasn't quite\nconnecting to the internet so I slowed\nright down to wait and ask just to make\nsure it was all good and I lost the\ngroup so the group's pushed on I've been\non this bit of road by myself for a bit\nnow all good still averaging like 28ks\nan hour which going slightly uphill at\n1% is not too bad I'm going to keep\npushing on and uh update you soon\n[Applause]\nall right so quick little update 2 and\n1/ half hours ride time done 60 K was on\nsome Tac for quite a while and then\njumped onto the gravel and then jumped\nback onto the TAC and then back onto the\ngravel some really nice gravel roads so\nfar I'm a bit annoyed with myself about\nscrewing up the tracker thing at the\nstart because it meant that I missed the\nfront group and then I've kind of been\npicking guys off as they go along but\ntrying to keep my heart rate at a\nreasonable Zone and uh not push too hard\nbut apparently the front guys are really\npushing on and there's about 15 of them\nor so I haven't looked at the dots but\nyeah I would have liked to have seen\nthose guys go off so I knew where they\nwere who they were and how far ahead\nthey were going to be but oh well out\nhere enjoying riding my bike mid 20°\nwe're at about 1,000 M elevation\nw\nall right I'm uh\n2170 M holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] this climb is steep and\nloose so brutal to make matters worse\nI'm going straight into a block headwind\nthat's probably 20ks an hour I can\nbarely take my hands off the bars it's\njust flattened out so I can film this\nI'm going to put my phone down again and\nkeep climbing\nokay pretty much at the top now I\nseriously rank tette pass as the hardest\nthing I've ever done on the bike that\nwas\nunbelievable hey man you talking to your\nphone yeah just talking about just\ntalking about how Bloody H it is yeah it\nis it really\nis all right I literally did that enti\nentire climb probably at threshold Watts\nI don't have a power meter on my bike\nbut I seriously reckon I was at\nthreshold Watson heart rate the entire\nway I didn't walk I genuinely ranked\ngetting up that without walking as one\nof the highlights of my bike riding\ncareer now comes the infamous walking\ngoat track down the other side of tette\npass and it's super windy\nI can see why everyone was saying that\nday one is the most difficult 119 K in\ncome over the uh the pass there\nnow there's all the walking down this\ngoat track on the other side some people\ncan ride it I definitely can't\ncheckpoint one in 7 km\ncheckpoint one coming\nup huh yeah man there enough to annoy me\nhello how are\nwe good how you yeah that clim perent\nwas it was something else all\nright\nso\n17 got to get this on the vog every\nsingle\ndetail all right cool\nthank you so much you're\nwelcome all right cp1 out the way done\n125k filled up with water got a Coke\nbarely drank any and uh now back on the\nroad going to aim for maybe km 170\nbefore I stop\nB\nall righty just a little update here\nbecause the Sun is going down it's 700\np.m. I've got uh 9 hours 21 ride time\n144 K come uh out of checkpoint one\ntried to fill up as quick as possible\ndidn't do a very good job but first time\nso whatever got it done and then got on\nmy way I was on a bit of a road for a\nwhile and then started up a climb have\nnow ended up on a bit of a high Plateau\nstill climbing as you can see the reason\nI pull out myone on the climbs is\nbecause it's just Impossible on the\ndescents so as I said 9 hours 21 feeling\nsurprisingly good hey I'm quite\nsurprised at checkpoint one my legs were\nstarting to get a bit heavy and I had a\nprotein shake I've got uh four of the\nsachet with me for this race and I think\nthat really really helped I've also been\ndrinking a lot of carbohydrates today\nlike a lot a lot like a majority of my\nbag is actually just full of\ncarbohydrate powder haven't had any\ncaffeine yet I'm going to keep riding\nfor a while uh the next stop is at km\n185 that's about uh 40ks away so I'm\ngoing to keep riding to there try and\nget some dinner and then uh crack on a\nbit further see where I get to and maybe\nhave a sleep at about 1:00 a.m. or so\nenjoying this a lot yeah back to it\nokay it\nis\n8:47 p.m. done uh 4 and 1/ 12,000 M\nclimbing and I'm at about a column at\n168 it's a bit of slow going at the\nmoment I was feeling really really good\nalong that flat section at the top of\nthat little plateau\nand then the road started getting\nrougher and rougher and then we kind of\nheaded down into this little canyon and\nuh it got dark as it does at night uh\nthat was no problem but then we're\ngetting smashed by this wind I swear it\nwas probably 40 km hour wind from\ndirectly in front and also slightly to\nthe side I almost got blown off my bike\nmultiple times there had been some\npretty hectic clouds ahead and they were\nactually sending bolts of lightning into\nthe sky so I was a bit nervous that we\nwere riding straight into it which we\npretty much were and then it started\nraining I stopped and put on a rain\njacket and it was pretty Grim for about\nuh 20 or 30 minutes I was kind of near\nthree other riders that have sort of\nbeen near all day so we all stopped and\nput on a jacket at the same time but\nthen everyone kind of headed off and did\ntheir own thing as I said about km 168\nand heading for a town at km 100\nand\n84 it's interesting you know because we\nsort of ride through these places and go\nto these places that people always say\nare the middle of nowhere you know right\nnow I'm riding along and I was just\nthinking far out this is in the middle\nof nowhere and there's a town here I'm\nriding through this small town and then\nit kind of Dawns on me that like it\nmight be the middle of nowhere to me but\nto the people who live here it's the\ncenter of their world I find that idea\nsuper interesting I just had to record\nthat on\nvideo uh yeah another [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] storm\nheaps of rain this time that ain't fun I\nneed to find a rock\noh\nyep this will do for a\nbit all right the wind's died down a bit\nuh the uh the rain's also died down it's\nstill raining but I'm going to jump back\non the bike and press on see if I can\nmake it to that town in about 10K\ntime see if I can do this\njesuso saying\n7° getting close to that town there\nokay just uh a quick update it's um\nabout 3:30 in the morning I'm at a very\nsmall town that I don't actually know\nthe name of uh it's literally not even\non Google Maps last night I was riding\nalong and I hid under that rock when it\ngot real torrential and I had my rain\njacket on but I didn't have any leg\nwarmers on it and because it was so\nwindy and so rainy I didn't want to open\nmy bag and take out my leg warmers so I\ngot really cold but I wanted to push on\nthe 10 km to the next town which was\nthis one here as I got to this town\nthere was a guy who was like a local\nAuthority he was like sort of a\npoliceman or like a townsman he just\nlike looks after this town and he came\nup to me and he said do you need help\nare you okay and I was like yeah yeah\nI'm okay and then I rolled off to the\nside to put on my uh to put a Bas layer\non and and change clothes and he was\nlike do you want us to get you a bed and\nso there's like a local I guess it's\nkind of equivalent of like a hostel but\nyou don't pay for it where they look\nafter people and uh me and a few of the\nother guys who were around at the same\ntime we all got a little bed here had a\ncouple of hours of sleep the wind has\nbeen absolutely howling um but I'm so\nthankful to have this guy look after me\nyeah so it's now 3:30 in the morning I\nfigure I may as well get out there and\nride even if it's 4 km an hour into a\nblock headwind I'm going to try and ride\nuntil breakfast time get some breakfast\nsee what the wind's doing and uh yeah\nkeep going on from there day one would\nan experience so\nfar I'll see you out there that's good\nC all righty Let's uh let's do this\nall right just a morning update it is\nthe second morning 2nd of October it's a\nSunday morning just stopped and had an\nomelet after what's probably the most\nbrutal 70 km of my life I rolled out\nthis morning at 350 just straight into a\nheadwind probably like 30 to 40ks an\nhour at times doing 7 km an hour going\ndownhill and then eventually it started\nto sort of lighten up and um I was onto\nthis kind of weird moonscape looking\nlooking area which was really cool but\nagain still really really windy some\nreally hard technical sections which I\njust couldn't film cuz it's just too\ndifficult to pull out my phone and then\nthe sun came up and it's just kind of\nthis like white ball so interesting\nmorning it's taken 5 hours to do 70 km\nso moving pretty slow and now we go into\nthe first of the 100 km sections with\nnothing so eaten plenty of food filled\nup with everything and now I'm going to\ndo 100k ha just really hoping the wind\nknees up cuz it's just it's super\ntaxing all right so the date is Friday\nthe 16th of September it's 2 weeks until\nAtlas I've spent the last 48 hours with\na bit of anxiety uh about this race I'm\na bit nervous I met up with Zippy today\nZippy Doyle he finished Badlands two\nweeks ago and he had a whole bunch of\nadvice to give me about doing a big\nevent like this now I know this sounds\nlike pure ignorance getting advice two\nweeks before a massive 1,00 km event but\nI need all the help I can get at this\nmoment trying to wrap my head around\nwhat's about to\ncome so thinking about it I don't think\nit's actually the distance that's kind\nof making me anxious the physical side\nof it I feel like I've got down it's\nmore the mental side of doing something\nthat you haven't done before in terms of\nbeing in the Moroccan desert riding\nalong with absolutely no one around\nhoping that your bike doesn't fall apart\nor that your mind doesn't fall apart I'm\ntrying to make this as honest as honest\nas possible it's it's kind of a scary\nthought you know I don't know whether\nit' be nervous or or excited or I guess\nthere's a bit of both right now so\nthis is going to be interesting\nso much fun that's the best part of the\ncourse so far\nsh\nback to\nclimbing it never\nstops at least the views are good though\nall right I've been reduced to walking\nyou can't tell how steep this is but\nthis might be hotter than yesterday's\npass so Rocky heaps the sections above\nlike 18\n20% I'm exhausted\nall right so I'm feeling super super\nexhausted I'm going to pull my pillow\nout set my alarm for 20\nminutes lie down on this thing here have\na nice\nup little tip always bring an eye mask\nhad that tucked in my\npocket had a great little sleep now to\nget up and crack\non all right sleep out the way time to\nget this\nlast 38 km done of the 100 km\nsection go and grab some\nfood all right quick little update while\nI got a chance\nuh where did I leave off okay so R in up\nthat big steep mof of climb it was so\nSteep and so Rocky super brutal I was\ncooked when I got to the top so I rolled\ndown the other side and as I was\ndescending I started to get a little bit\nsort of wobbly so I was just like you\nknow what I'll lie down and have a\nlittle sleep so I napped for 20 minutes\nand then got up kept riding had that\namazing scenery when we were up on the\nplateau there in insane definitely the\nbest scenery so far and I was just\nloving flowing down that descent on the\nmountain bike it goes so well again I\ncannot imagine trying to do this race on\na gravel bike it's so enjoyable with je\nsuspension and fat tires and then just\nstopped and had a little bit of\nbasically what is going to be dinner\nwhich is a few cans of tuna had a\nprotein shake and now it's about 7:00 so\nofficial sunset is in about 20 minutes\ntoday's been real weird it's just been\nkind of gray all day like you barely\nreally saw the Sun at all sort of did\nsee it but it was just like this weird\ngray sky anyway I'm going to ride off\ninto the night here down about uh 3 and\n1 12,000 M climbing so yeah Chuck my\nheadlights on and right into the\ndark all right so the date is\nWednesday September 21 I've got 8 days\nuntil I leave for Atlas and it's testing\ntime now my mountain bike hasn't arrived\nyet so I'm riding the gravel bike out\nhere and what I've done is I've packed\nup my bike with bags and I've got\nprobably about 80% of the things that\nI'm carrying with me that I'm planning\non taking to Atlas I'm doing a little\novernighter I'm not focusing on the\nriding component I'm focusing on the the\novernight component the doing the\npractice of having my sleeping system\ngetting it out in the dark setting it up\nand then packing it up as quick as I can\nin the morning and keeping on riding\nthat's the focus for today super\nbeautiful afternoon out here I'm just in\nJona I'm doing a gravel ride that I know\nit's not super super rough the aim is\njust to to cruise along practice\npedaling with not a lot of wats and then\nfinding a spot to set up setting up\nsleeping the night and then uh keeping\non going in the morning\nso uh little update after the last\ncouple of hours I've been riding into\nthe gavaris trails here in Jona just\nletting it get darker and darker and\ndarker as I said before this ride is not\nnecessarily about the actual bike riding\ncomponent and more just about riding\nuntil it gets dark finding a spot to\npitch my sleep system and and getting\nsome sleep I've ridden into the dark\nbefore um but by myself in the jungle\nin the in the forest it's it's\ninteresting little experience I'm sure\nthis will bode well for me come uh the\nnighttime in Morocco in 10 days\ntime morning update for you it's Monday\nmorning the 3D\nuh day three of Atlas mountain race\ncurrently out on this road out somewhere\nnear Algeria I\nthink uh it's 710 in the morning so\nsunrises in 10 minutes although it looks\nlike it's going to be another sort of\ngray day it's weird it's like not gray\ncloudy it's like gray Dusty or something\nanyway it gives the landscape this kind\nof eerie look I've been out here for a\ncouple of hours now already in the dark\njust turned off my\nlights last night I rode up this massive\nRoad climb that seems the last for ages\nand then I got to the top of that and uh\nit was about 1:00 in the morning and\njust as I was coming through this town\nthere were these couple of young guys\nand they pointed a light at me and I\nkind of waved me over and they were\nactually they had a little hotel and\nrestaurant in there open at 1:00 in the\nmorning and the guy said do you want to\nTajin and I was like yeah I was so tired\nI didn't take any video of it so ate a\nlittle bit of food there and then uh I\nlay down on the floor and I slept for\nabout an hour and a half 2 hours and\nthen I got up and got out and uh yeah so\nI'm out here now I'm pretty tired not\nquite even at the halfway mark but\nthat's my aim for\ntoday oh yeah and the other reason that\nit was quite good to stay in that little\nplace even if just on the floor was that\nit gave me a chance to charge a couple\nof things I'm going to do a bigger\nbreakdown of everything I brought and uh\nhow I managed all my power and batteries\nand things like that in a video coming\nsoon so if you haven't subscribed to the\nYouTube channel please do subscribe cuz\nuh I'm going to do a couple of follow-up\nvideos about my experience what I\nbrought and what I learned if you are\nthinking about doing an ultra race like\nAtlas mountain or\nstuff like that\nall right another update kilm about\n499 now just had this mad descent on\nthat gravel road so so thick you could\ndo that on a gravel bike but on the\njewelry I could just absolutely let\nloose it was so nice and then uh popped\nonto a road for a little while and I\nstarted getting really really tired I\nwas actually almost starting to KN off\non the bike the road was just too smooth\nuh and then came into a town called tasn\nwhich was actually quite a big town and\nI sat and I had a couple of creps a\ncouple of coffees and now I got my full\ngame face on I uh had to look at where\nmy DOT is I think I'm currently 14th at\nthe moment so I'm just trying to chase\ndown and go as far as I can I really\nwant to see what I can do over the next\ntwo days\nwarm\nso what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] there was a perfectly\nridable Trail just there which is just\nover there you know what we have to go\nthrough\nthis how is\nthis how did they come out with this as\na\ncourse this is ridiculous this is more\nmentally taxing Than Physical got a red\nball here just in case plenty of water\nhaving a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]\nshocker for some reason the big waho\njust decides to just cut out after like\n13 hours it just doesn't recognize a GPS\nanymore and so the P the speed just like\ncomes to a dead stop and it just says\nzero and I've got my my backup waho and\nthat one can't find the GPS so not in a\ngood mood food on top of that the road\nitself just has some absolutely [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]\nstupid parts to it where it tells you to\ngo off onto like some crappy riverbed\nand then you're riding along the rivered\nand then all of a sudden the route's on\nthe trail that you were just on and\nyou've like hiked down into the rivered\nand then you got to hike back up I don't\nknow if that's like a GPS [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up a\ncommo [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up Nelson's just the route to\nbe annoying it's so tiring though it's\nso taxing I don't mind a bit of hiker\nbike I don't mind a bit of Adventure\nthis is just the kind of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that you\njust like what is what is this\n[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] yeah that's not swearing uh my\nWahoo's got GPS now so I guess I better\nkeep keep riding\ncardboards for the win\nit's Sunday\n25th um of September I'm leaving on\nThursday so I've Got 5 days to go until\nI leave I've got 4 days to go until I\nleave I'm about to go and pick up my\nbike now my new bike that I'm going to\nbe riding I'm so [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] nervous\nhey like the race doesn't even start for\na week and I cannot stop thinking about\nit my anxiety is through the roof I'm\ndreaming about it every night and as\nsoon as I wake up that's all I'm\nthinking about it's not the writing part\nI think I'll be okay for the writing\npart it's just the\nsleeping and the eating\nand I can't even think straight I better\ngo and pick up the bike so I'm on my way\nto pick up my bike this the sea Oto Jona\nuh bike show is happening in Jona this\nweekend so what I'm doing is I'm heading\nover to The BMC stand at the sea Oto\nit's really really epic of BMC to lend\nme a demo bike for this event about 2\nyears ago when I got the entry for Atlas\nmountain race I was like God I'm going\nto need to get a mountain bike and I've\nevery time it's been postponed I've\nthought okay that gives me a bit more of\na chance to get a mountain bike and\nfinally because it's going ahead I\nreached out to BMC and uh they decided\nthat they would help me out with and\nmountain bike so I'm about to go and\npick up my mountain bike for this event\nit's a duel suspension bike I'm going to\nshow you in a moment I'm pretty excited\nabout it I'm trying to calm my nerves\nbut I think a mountain bike is the best\noption for this\nrace thanks\nman\ncheers all righty so I've just come home\nfrom uh the sea OT calmed my nerves a\nlot I've picked up my new bike as you\ncan see here this bike is a BMC\nfourstroke LT a 120 mm dual suspension\nmountain bike now if you think it's a\nbit like bringing a bazooka to a\ngunfight it is it's an absolute beast\nand from everyone I've spoken to about\nAtlas mountain race before going they've\nall said this is a good idea the reason\nwhy is even though Atlas is classed as a\ngravel race it's so so rough and Rocky\nthat having a dual suspension bike just\nMak sense mountain bikes these days are\nso so efficient at pedaling they're not\nlike bikes back in the day where you're\nat a real weight disadvantage and a\nsuspension disadvantage because of the\nbobbing of the suspension these days you\ncan lock the suspension out on this\nfourstroke that I'm running you can\nactually lock it out halfway so you can\nhave a sort of semick out which is\namazing for pedling efficiency I don't\nknow if anyone else in the race is going\nto be running a bike this big and\nalthough right now I'm a little bit\nnervous for dragging this thing across\n1100 km of uh Gravel Road and off-road\nterrain I'm hoping that it does the job\nreally well I'm going to take it out for\na spin shortly and uh go and give it a\ntest yeah that's what I got I'm so the\npumped\nall righty so I'm out for my first ride\non the new BMC fourstroke that I just\npicked up like 2 hours ago I've had\nquite a lot of anxiety around this\naround getting this bike so close to the\nevent and having enough time to test it\nso I picked it up from the guys at The\nBMC stand they had the demo bike there\nfor me they bought it straight from\nSwitzerland so I said Hey to the guys\nthere they passed me the bike set it up\nfor me a bit shock pressure and things\nlike that I brought it home I've had a\ngood hard look at it I've also whacked\non the bags I packed my bags with about\n90% of what I'm taking I'm just missing\na very few small things one of the\nthings I can say straight up I've just\nrolled out a Jona up a steep little\nclimb I'm climbing up like 15 16 177%\npinches here and it's so comfortable\nit's incredible I think this is a really\ngood decision to go for JE suspension\nbike it just sort of tracks the ground\nreally well especially when climbing and\nalso the gearing I'm running 34 on the\nfront and 50 on the back so I can get up\nanything really\nright it's\nuh Monday afternoon Monday evening I\nthink been out here 2 and 1/2\ndays uh done 640\nK and about 12,000 M\nclimbing I'm\nreally I'm really really\n[&nbsp;__&nbsp;]\nuh I've slept about 4 and 1/2 hours\ntotal in the last 2 and 1/2\ndays uh my fingers have lost a bit of\nfeeling in them my wrist is super\n[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I like can't move my thumb\nproperly without my wrist absolutely\nkilling me which really sucks when the\nshifter is right there and you need your\nthumb to shift the gears I got about uh\n20 or 30ks to go until I reach\ncheckpoint 2 I'm going to get there then\nthere's about 520 K to the Finish\nLine I'm going to have to pull something\nspecial out of the bag to get this one\ndone let me ride into the\nnight I'll see how I'm feeling in a\ncouple of hours\nuh yep that's exactly what I want the\nWahoo's just switched off I have to wait\nto recover that ride see where I'm\nmissing uh where I'm going and try and\nget\nthere multi-day rides\nman absolutely\nbrutal all right so I'm still on the\nright route which is basically just this\nclimb uh over a pass or something down\nto the checkpoint let me keep going day\nthree the brutal one let's hope\ntomorrow's better\nhey sorry I'm just having a a hard time\njust done to a road for a little\nbit uh and then I'm going to\nI guess it turns back to\ngravel basically I've got to go over\nthis next climb down the other side\nthat's going to probably take me\nabout 8 or 9\nhours hopefully less but we'll\nsee and uh just push on for as far as I\ncan um thank you for for being there for\nme it means a lot this\nis this is really fun [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]\nhard it's really [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hard but I\nreally want to get it\ndone I'll message you when I get\ninternet again okay I love\nyou what a day what a\nday what a last 24 hours one of the most\ninteresting uh emotionally\ntaxing\nfascinating painful really really\npainful emotionally damaging days of my\nlife Morocco is leaving some pretty\ninteresting marks on\nme at least the sunlight's nice right\nnow there good\nviews just under 400 km to\ngo I can't wait to get there\nokay morning up dead for\nyou it's\nh okay it's Wednesday morning\n3 days and uh 23 hours since I started\nleft\nmares the last 36 hours have probably\nbeen have gone into like the darkest\nplaces I've ever been my wrist is so\nsore that I can't move my thumb I can\njust hold the\nhandlebars every time I go over a\nbump it sends like a shock wave through\nmy hand and my arm\nI can't sit down properly so I have to\nstand up but that means that I have to\nuse my wrist the road is so so cracked\nand so uneven that I have to shift but\nevery time I shift it hurts even more I\nalmost scratched two nights ago I just\nhad Mike's words in my head many a race\ncampaign of being saved on a good\nnight's\nsleep the thing that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] me up real\nbad was that I got to checkpoint 2 and I\nthought it was a GPS error and I kept\ngoing and I went an extra 10ks down the\nroad which included a descent that's the\nsteepest descent I've ever been down in\nmy life and I got to the bottom and I\nwas looking around for checkpoint 2\nwhere I thought it was meant to be and I\nrealized that it was back at the spot\nthat I had stopped out the front of but\nI hadn't seen any sign or anything any\nindication it was a checkpoint and so\nI'd kept rolling and so I had to climb\nback up that steep climb at about\nmidnight\nwith my wrist killing me and I\nuh I was so close I was so close to\nscratching at the time I think I was\nabout position\n16 and I just had to tell myself throw\nthe idea of competing out the window now\nit's about surviving I woke up in the\nmorning I couldn't bring myself to speak\non camera all I could do was get ready\nslowly with my wrist and put everything\nback in my bag and then yesterday was\njust up and down roller coaster I rolled\nout at 10:00 a.m. and every single thing\nseemed to be going wrong when I turned\nmy Wahoo on even though it had 40%\nbattery the night before it said it was\nat 1% and then I pulled out my spare\nWahoo I turned that on and that was also\nat 1% and I couldn't believe it that I\nhad two Wahoos both that were meant to\nbe at 40 or 50% and somehow overnight\neven though they were Switched Off they\ndrained to 1%\nso I felt like everything was against me\nyesterday morning so I spent a majority\nof the morning in tears thinking that\nthat might be race over with 500ks to go\nbut this has been 2 years coming and I\nrefuse to let the race beat me I\ndon't I don't give a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] what it throws\nat\nme I really really want to get through\nthis I refuse to uh to let it beat me so\nI rolled up a climb over a climb stopped\nin a little um kind of not even a shop\nbut just with a local guy and also with\nanother Rider and just had some yogurt\nand some dates and then kept going it\nwas really hot it was like\n35° then up and over another climb the\nentire day my wrist was killing me the\nentire day I was so so sore but as I\nticked off the Cs I kind of started to\ncome around and then I started to claw\nback a few places and then I finished\nthe day on a road with with a really\nreally nice Sunset and then pushed on\ninto the night I wanted to get as far as\nI could and then last night I finally\ndecided that it was time to pull myself\ntogether and get this thing done and so\nnow as you can see it is about 7:45 in\nthe morning the sun's coming up behind\nme I've got uh this small little pass to\ngo a big descent off that get some\nbreakfast two big climb still about 350\nK to go but I'm feeling like I can do\nthis in one go I think I think that the\nend isn't Insight I really hope the end\nis Insight I can't wait to be an a year\nso where did you sleep there was a place\n10 km\nfar where there was a nice Sun passage\nand I\nthought if this continues till here I\nwill be my breakfast in half an hour\noh but it took 1 and a half hour and\nthen what time did you get\nhere 9 9 okay what time is it now\n9:30 when did you get up this morning I\ndidn't get up until six\nall right kilometer\n850 The Climb that I went over last\nnight I thought that I could get over\nand down the other side in about 5 or 6\nhours and it was about 60 K\nlong and the climb up had sections of\nroad that just ended and you had to\nclimb down into a crevice and drag the\nbike up the other side back onto the\nroad this Old Colonial piece it was wild\nit was so Rocky I ended up having to\nhike for large portions of it just walk\nwith the bike so I was averaging like 2\nand 1/2 K an hour for like\ncertain sections the stars were out the\nmoon was out so I was able to turn off\nthe lights and just walk but then I got\nnear the top of that and I just thought\nyou know what I need to I need to sleep\nI'm not going to be able to go any\nfurther it's just too it's too battering\non my body so I set up my bivy and I\nslept and then got up this morning\nthinking I just had the Descent to do\nand The Descent which was only about 15\nkm took me I don't know maybe an hour\nand a half 2 hours just getting thrashed\naround it was just as hard descending as\nit was climbing even on on a full\nsuspension bike kudos to the guys who\ndid it on the gravel bikes I'm really\nreally over it now I'm also I'm having a\nhard time with my wrist it's no worse\nthan it was yesterday but it's\ndefinitely no better anyway it sounds\nlike that Old Colonial piece that we\njust did at 60k stretch that was the\nhardest of the whole race so I feel like\nbeing outside the other side of that and\nnow onto this road where I've just had\nan omelet in the next town now I'm offer\n100ks of nothing and over another big\nclimb it's about 150 K to checkpoint 3 I\nreally want to try and get there by\ntonight\nright figured out I'm\nkilom 930 or so so there's about 60 to\ngo to the next checkpoint uh about 40 to\nthe next town just had a small stop in a\nspot that wasn't actually on the list of\nuh resupply points luckily there was a\nshop there though so I could have a\ndrink and fill up my water bottles and\neverything again big day but I'm\nmotivated to get to checkpoint 3 and\nthen I'm motivated to keep going after I\nget there so I can put another 50 or\n50ks into the\nfinal70 or whatever that's\nleft I've had uh three big climbs in the\nlast two days really really big climbs\nlike these like climbs that take a\ncouple of hours each if not more the one\nlast night just went forever hiking\nclimbing trying to ride it was so Rocky\nI've just got one left it's about 800 M\nup from where I am at the moment I'm at\nabout 1,000 M here and uh the top is at\n8,800 but it's got to descend to the\nmiddle of it towards the top so I'm\nprobably got about another 1,200 1500 M\nof climbing up this climb now then down\nthe other side to the next town and to\nthe checkpoint getting there I can feel\nthe end in sight my wrist is killing me\nbut uh motivated by some messages that\nyou guys have been sending me and also\njust the idea of an ice cream at the\nfinish line\nthat is the third climb out the way\nthink we're about to go into a beautiful\nbig road descent at sunset this is\nperfect check this out\nH well that was\nshortlived I guess Nelson being Nelson\nand Atlas mountain race being atas\nMountain race means that it was never\ngoing to be straightforward I got uh\n20ks to the checkpoint got to hike\nthrough a bush to get\nthere uh\nuh 4\nday hour\n11 so\ngood oh that feels so damn\ngood 34 hours to get from checkpoint 2\nto checkpoint 3 330\nkm massive feed\nall right so it's Wednesday\nnight it is the final night for me of\nthe Atlas mountain race I did 190 km\nearlier today and now I've just left\ncheckpoint 3 and I'm heading for the\nFinish Line 170 K to go and uh a few\nRoad climbs from what I understand some\nMountain bike single track stuffff and\nthen the Finish Line in agader today was\npretty epic actually my wrist started\nfeeling better and better over the\ncourse of the afternoon it's not perfect\ndefinitely can't shift easily but at\nleast I can hold the bars more\ncomfortably now and then when I got to\nthe the Finish Line at checkpoint 3 just\nthen had a big feed of some food sat\nwith a couple of guys wasted a bunch of\ntime waiting for my waho to charge and\nuh a lot of other guys who actually got\nto checkpoint 3 after me left before me\nso so this is a good Learning lesson for\nme one of the big things that this shows\nis that bike packing races are less\nabout how well you ride your bike and\nmuch more about how well you manage your\noverall time my riding speed has been\nquite quick but my overall time has been\nquite slow just because of the amount of\nstopping and faffing that I do with my\nbike bags and eating and anyway I'm on\nto the final stage going to crack\nthrough this try and stay up all night\ncuz I haven't pulled an all nighter yet\nget to the Finish Line in agader aiming\nfor around 5 days see how I\ngo this is so godamn\nhard this is like\n12% loose\nrocks pushing the\nbike still got 80k to go to the\nFinish in my hopes of getting there by\n9:00\na.m. getting\nslim I've just\ngot I've just got no more energy left to\ngive this has\ntaken every single bit of energy out of\nme for\nall righty so this will be my last\nupdate before I roll out the day is\nFriday the 30th of September 2022 and in\nthe morning Atlas mountain race 2022\nstarts I have been on such an emotional\nroller coaster the last few weeks trying\nto get ready for this event and my\nbiggest emotion around this has been one\nof anxiety and fear but now I've made it\nto Morocco my bike's built I did\nregistration today I went to the writer\nbriefing I got my brev card and I'm\nsitting out here on the balcony with the\nview of maresh and the view of the Atlas\nMountains in the background and the\noverwhelming feeling that I have at this\nmoment is one of peace and after so much\nthinking about it and so much stress to\nget here and feel this way feels really\nreally nice so I hope whatever happens\nit's exciting I hope to get through in\none piece and I hope you guys have\nenjoyed this journey with me tomorrow\nit's time to go and ride my bike and\nI'll see you guys in another episode\nsoon all right there you\nnah nah\ngood see you oh dude holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]\ncan of wait to see the stamp on this\nthing you're an Engle\nbastard been\nsome some moments\nget that\nstamp oh\nyeah je thank you very much

          "transcript": "you know when you find one of those\nchallenges that seem so far Out Of Reach\nand just way out of your league it feels\nalmost silly to consider it until you\nfind it keeping you up at night like a\nniche that needs\nscratching well this for me was the\nAtlas mountain race\n6 months previously to this I found\nmyself in Kiran doing the Silk Road\nMountain race I stepped away from there\ncompleting it as my first ever Ultra as\nwell the Silk Road left a huge impact on\nme and directed the decision for signing\nup for the Atlas mountain race a chance\nto experience a very different country\nthan where I'm from with a rich culture\nand a deserty landscape with 4,000 M\nPeaks I had the urge to head to\n[Music]\nMorocco once arriving in Mar I had 4\ndays to settle in and prepare for the\nrace as well as explore the city a\nlittle I was so excited to be\nhere so I'm Becky I'm 22 and cycling has\nbeen a part of my life for a very long\ntime so I started road racing when I was\n11 years old and thanks to the support\nof my mom and dad I continued to race\nall throughout my childhood I got to a\npoint where I was racing nationally and\nthen beginning to win Nationals\neventually towards the end of them five\nyears I was invited to join the Olympic\ndevelopment Academy which is a part of\nthe program for obviously being on the\nOlympic pathway towards the end I\nstopped due to a number of different\nreasons and I feel like with this I've\njust sort of Gone full circle now and\nI'm coming back to to these races but\nobviously completely different racing to\ntrack and road racing but I'm coming\nback with a different mindset of just\nenjoying the process having a great\nexperience um witnessing the different\ndynamics of like culture and the\nlandscape and obviously storytelling but\nyeah I felt so lucky to be in mares\nstarting this epic adventure after a\nlong winter which made training very\ndifficult but also a great motivation to\nget out on my bike on those cold Dark\nNight night it felt great to finally\nfeel the heat on my skin as I arrived in\nMorocco in the days building up to the\nrace it was great to ride the outskirts\nof Marakesh get my first glimpse of the\nAtlas Mountains and even Explore the\nMedina with fellow Riders\n[Laughter]\nafter 4 days of sightseeing and\npreparing it was now race\nday the race started at 6:00 p.m. so up\nuntil that point I got my bike checked\nwhich is mandatory I collected my race\ncap and tracking device as well I\nmanaged to get some sleep as I wouldn't\nbe getting much of that for a while\n6 p.m rolled around and you could feel\nthe tension and the nerves between the\n200 plus Riders at the start line I was\nso excited to start and couldn't wait to\nhead to the\nmountains so we have Now set off I'm not\nsure entirely where I am but the pace is\njust extremely quick at the front of the\ngroup time is half six been running half\nan hour it's going to be a long long\nnight\n[Applause]\nso it took me all night to get over to a\npass which is over 2,000 M and it was a\nSavage Savage pass there was snow there\nwas undulating terrain there wasn't\nreally a path at some points and you\njust picking your way down this mountain\nobviously it's pitch black so navigating\nwas extremely difficult with the snow\nand the dark I really didn't think it\nwas going to take that long but I ended\nup getting down to checkpoint one which\nis pretty much the bottom so you're\ngoing up and over this pass and I got\nthere about 700 a.m. so starting at 6:00\np.m. from\nMarakesh and it took all that time and I\nthink it was roughly 70 M so that is\npretty crazy so I have to admit I was\nslightly nervous about day one and also\nthe sleep deprivation Factor I'd never\ndone an event where sleep deprivation is\ninvolved I've always enjoyed a good\nnight's sleep so this was definitely a\nnew challenge and to be up for that\namount of time is pretty crazy and\nobviously you're not getting the\nnutrition and food back um so to get to\ncheckpoint one which you kind of got to\ndo in order to finish the race on time\nyou need to get there that night or the\nearly hours to know that you're going to\nfinish on time um and yeah I was just so\nso chuffed that I made it there after\nprobably the longest night of my life\ning from 6:00 p.m. to 7 a.m. I couldn't\nbelieve it when I rolled in at\ncheckpoint 1 the next morning after such\na brutal first day up to let pass\nfeeling absolutely knackered I got an\nhour of shut ey before continuing on day\ntwo was extremely hot and my main focus\nwas to keep hydrated and protected from\nthis intense Sun the landscape didn't\ndisappoint with the Atlas Mountains\ntowering over me me and the constant\nMoon Scapes making this place seem like\nI was on a different\nplanet the hiker bik continued and I\nsoon realized this route wasn't for the\nfainthearted this Barren landscape made\nme feel vulnerable as my lips cracked\nand my 4 lers of water diminished with\nno River in sight to replenish I very\nquickly learned that this is a tough\nenvironment and you have to be switched\non with resupplying on food and water\nwater at each Village for the next 5\nhours I rode through the most stunning\nsections of desert with the most unique\nand intricate pieces of\nrock we are still riding in the dark the\ntime is\n9:00 and yeah hoping to be at this\nresupply point very shortly this section\nis sure dragging out just walking\nthrough River\nbeds yeah got lost a few\ntimes when the darkness came I struggled\nto stay awake as I followed my Dynamo\nlight through the night after 5 hours or\nso of riding I reached a cafe at\nmidnight to resupply and get some\nshatti so the time is 12:00 and we've\njust arrived at this CF spa place in um\num I'm trying to think of the name of it\nnow it's too late to think but yeah got\nup\nat I think it was 9 this morning after\nan hour of sleep and now it's 12 I think\nwe get a few hours of sleep get some\nfood and stay in here I was planning on\nbivy in tonight but it's freezing and\nthey said that we could sleep in the\ncafe so we literally all just setting up\nour roll mats on the cafe floor so yeah\nthat was handy I then had some hot food\nwhich consisted of a freeze dried meal\nand a tajine inspected my hands which\nwere slowly going numb and then got into\nbed which I was so ready\nfor good morning from osine I am just at\nthe petrol station here as I'm going to\nget some food but yeah slept like 4\nhours last night kept waking up cuz\nthere was people coming in and out and\nthe light was on um I've got the worst\ncough in the world I think it's all the\ndust and the sand but apart from that it\nwas nice to actually get some sleep so\nsome 4 hours rough sleep going to\nresupply now before we do a river\ncrossing in a minute and then have a\n100K stretch of no resupply so that\nshould be interesting why do these\nchallenging trips people often ask me\nthe question usually comes into my own\nhead when I'm having a low moment other\nthan the experience of an unusual\nenvironment and seeing beautiful sights\nit's a feeling that can't exact ly be\nexplained having the ability to witness\nultimate highs and ultimate lows in a\nsingle day the fact you feel so alive as\nyou're flooded with numerous emotions as\nyou push yourself you strip the majority\nof addictions and comfort ultimately\nleaving the raw version of yourself and\nbecoming so connected with that as well\nas the Outdoor World around you I think\nbeing vulnerable creates character\nwhether you're facing running out of\nfood getting hit by bad bad weather not\nsleeping or running out of water these\ncore moments shape you even long after\nthe race is\nfinished good afternoon I'm currently\ngoing up one of the passes on the\nsection the 100K section that runs from\nimine I think it is to AFA um so this\nsection has no\nwater and no food supply so you have to\ncarry extra the past couple of days have\nbeen Carnage to be honest I was not\nexpecting the route to be so wild as in\njust really steep\nsections uh just Relentless really and\nalso getting lost navigating through\nRiver beds trying to carry your bike\nover rocks and down mountain passes so\nin terms of terrain there's been some\nvariety but I'm enjoying it so much and\nto feel the heat coming from a UK winter\nit's just crazy there's lots of\ndifferent factors to adapt to for this\nsuch as the heat like I said trying to\ntrain through winter which was a nogo\nreally because I don't have an indoor\ntrainer I luckily came on my period the\nday of the race which always makes\nthings so much tougher and yeah the lack\nof sleep the sunrise this morning was\ninsane it was so beautiful and it lit up\nthe Atlas Mountains in the distance and\ntimes like those I just really want to\nstay in that moment but you know you got\nto just keep riding but I was been to\nsomeone\nearlier and we said how you just\nappreciate time and you realize how much\nyou faf in maybe your normal life and I\nsure realize when I go to a town to\nresupply or go to get water how much I F\nand it's definitely disciplined to try\nand get yourself to do things quicker\nwhich I'm awful at sometimes very free\nspirited laxy Daisy I kept pushing on\ncovering similar terrain and till this\nhuge Gorge appeared with different\nshaped mountains surrounding it giving\noff similarities to the Grand Canyon I\ndescended for miles down into this\ngorgeous scenery before arriving in AFA\nhow are you how are you doing I'm good\nthanks oh hi Becky\nhey right hello I've now left the town\non and I'm back on the trail the Sun is\ngoing down and I'm going to be riding\ninto the night again I'm a little bit\nnervous just to due to strange strange\nsituations with like kids and the\nteenagers today just pulling on your\nbars and like holding a stick out a\nbranch to try and take you off your bike\nand touching you in weird places so yeah\nfeeling a little bit uncomfortable there\nwas a few points during the race I felt\nslightly uncomfortable and you could\ndefinitely sense A Woman's Worth here I\nfelt most comfortable in the remote\nsections where only rock juniper trees\nand Cactus surrounded me I also loved\nriding with others and learning about\nthem and their background it made those\nlong nights more\nbearable 95 kg you got a no fed you'll\ncarry the\nanother morning rolled around waking up\non a cafe floor in my bivvy somewhere in\nMorocco after a rough sleep I was\ntreated with some Moroccan tea as I\nbegan to deflate my thermarest and pack\nmy GE into my talin bags ready for\nanother day I was extremely grateful\nwhen the sun rose that morning\ndesperately waiting for 4 hours as I\ndrifted off multiple times on my bike\nthe sunrise was incredible and\nwitnessing this beautiful landscape made\neverything\nworthwhile it's good to see it\nwell good morning from the Atlas\nmountain race it is day 4 the time is\nhalf 7 it's just getting light been\nriding for about 3\nhours um still running on minimal sleep\nfeeling very very\ntired I'm just pushing on I keep waking\nup with so much blood in my throat like\na blocked throat um so it's not nice but\nyeah it's so nice to see the daylight\nagain it's been a long long night\nso I just went past that building that\nyou might have just\nseen and a man came running out with a\nteapot and a glass and he poured it and\nit looked more like a Milky like milk\nand tea rather than water but I I drank\nit even though I didn't really know what\nit was that was really kind though it\nwas just a very simple\ninteraction of just\nbonjour each other's\nnames and uh I just said where I'm\nheading and it's such a lovely day so\nI'm feeling very positive now I feel\nlike small interactions like that go a\nlong way other people's generosity can\nreally touch you on trips that are\nchallenging and in turn it is impact Ed\nthe way I act moving\nforward it was a pleasure we made it to\ncheckpoint 2 let's go get some food\nbe glasses\nof good morning currently having some\nbreakfast I am very\nhungry set up at\none a.m. and it's now 8\na.m. so\nit felt like an extremely long\nnight obviously just riding for hours\nand hours I fell asleep whilst riding\nthe Atlas mountain race is sure one of\nmy biggest challenges yet this race\ntested me in so many ways the main\nhurdles being the sleep deprivation\nwhich obviously makes you feel exhausted\nslows recovery and makes you lack energy\nbut it also affected me psychologically\nas well the heat made things so tough as\nas well as the isolation here completing\nthe race was hard enough as it was for\nme let alone capturing my time\nhere we are now on the Colonial Road\nwhich is pretty epic it is a gorgeous\nRoad as you can see and very well built\nI've loving the race so far and I love\nthe landscape I think the route is\namazing and the culture is so\ninteresting to me but it's a hard race\nand I don't think they let that on when\nyou talk about Silk Road there's a big\nimage behind it but in all honesty I\nthink this one's harder it's just very\nchallenging it's so dry I've had blood\nin my\nthroat every night and like have\ncoughing fits cuz of all the dust\nthere's no water so it's huge water\ncarries there's nowhere to like dip your\nfeet or wash your clothes or something\nlike that so yeah there's a lot of\ndifferent aspects that make this\nchallenging and it isn't easy and I\ndidn't want to portray it as being easy\nin my videos and I wanted to be straight\nand tell you that I'm struggling I'm\nsuffering and there's points I've\nthought about\nscratching\nbecause I think my why isn't really here\nlike why am I here I haven't got that\nreally stated firmly I think reflecting\nback now I'm so glad I kept pushing\nthrough and didn't give up suffering and\npain isn't permanent same goes with\ncomfort and pleasure so I think it's\nnice to see both sides of the spectrum\nso you can understand either party as\nwell at this point over a hundred people\nhad scratched which I was so surprised\nat I was also sitting at the back of the\nmid pack rather than battling with the\nsnail like I did at Silk Road I honestly\ncan't believe I rode 800 mi in Morocco\ndoing this prestigious race and I feel\nendlessly proud of myself pushing\nthrough and just getting on with it so\nthere's meant to be a lovely path that\npans all the way around but it's\nliterally just collapsed and eroded so\nI've got to go down here and take some\nsort of detour\nthis is\ncrazy I don't know how everyone else has\ngot up the other side\nso the time is now 12:00 and I've just\ngot into my bivvy I've just set it up\nI'm in the Outdoor Research bivvy which\nis super cozy um I've just got my mat\nand my quilt in here also my electric\nI'm going to charge now\nI\npretty it's has been such a long day and\nit just feels so good to be in my bivy\nI'm so glad that I'm not in a cafe or\nanything like that just in the middle of\nnowhere this beautiful spot just off the\nback of the old colonal\nroad good\nmorning from um it's a fan I think it is\nwhen you go through places so quickly\nyou forget the name of everywhere well I\ndo anyway but anyway talking about\nforgetting\nthings I really badly overslept so I\nhaven't been sleeping very well\nrecently I've been getting about 3 hours\nof broken\nsleep and just being woken up by people\nat the checkpoint or in a cafe people\nshouting or moving around and stuff so\nI've slept really crap and I've been\nriding along at times and like drifting\noff and waking up and been like oh I\njust simply can't keep my eyes open it's\nreally\nterrible um just feeling really dizzy\nand like trying to slap myself in the\nface to wake up I sat on my bivvy last\nnight Outdoor Research b bivvy and I\nlove it it's a hooped bivy and it felt\nlike oh it felt amazing the luxury um\nI've got a really nice sleep system with\nme so I set that up at about 12ish and\nwas set an alarm for 4 so I thought yeah\nI'll get 4 and 1 half hours of really\nquality sleep I knew I sleep better in a\nbivvy out doors and inside and uh I must\nhave turned my alarm off next minute I\nwoke up at4 to 7 and uh was like\nand quickly started packing my bivian\nsetup away which is didn't date too long\nwhich is why I bought a bivy instead of\na tent so I just got a quick omelette\ncoffee and\nhello and uh\nyeah headed on now obviously the sleeps\nmade me feel like 10 times better I feel\namazing I've got to stop here and get\nsome\nshots just try to balance everything as\nCarnage trying to get some nice shots\nand eat enough and sleep enough and ride\nthe distance\nand\nyeah I love mornings here they are my\nfavorite sleep and food eh that's all\nthat matters nice people I feel like\nI've woken up with so much\nClarity probably because I feel more\nhuman after sleeping and eating a really\nnice\nbreakfast\nbut oh I just feel so grateful for my\nlife and to be able to witness stuff\nlike this makes me really\nemotional\num just so grateful that we get to live\nthis life and we can choose whatever we\nwant to do with\nit we make our own restrictions and\nthings and made me feel so privileged\nwhen I come to these countries and I see\nhow people are living and I see how\nlittle they've got but how happy they\nare and they make the most of everything\nand they live day by day and I think\nthat's a really good lesson is to live\nday by day take take each day as it\ncomes and just focus on that day we put\nso much pressure and deadlines and\nexpectations on ourselves it creates\nunnecessary stress so\nwhen you do step away from a normal\nworld and you come and do stuff like\nthis you realize what really matter one\nmore reflection because I'm on a roll\nhere how quick does life go like how\nquickly does it go I'm only\n22 but if it was like yesterday I was 15\nand I set up this YouTube channel I was\ngoing bushcrafting with my dad and\nand that's 7 years\nago it's so scary and maybe some of you\nmight have watch me all that time ago\nbut I can't believe where that's gone\nMak you feel a little bit I don't\nknow\nstrange also what a lovely husky voice\nfrom inhaling all this dust\nafter\nmorning it is4 4 and I'm just leaving\ncheckpoint 3 I decided to stay here in\nthe end after a really hard decision\nwhether to push on and camp out but I\nstayed just because I can get some food\ncharge my stuff and I was pretty\nexhausted but yeah that's checkpoint 3\ndone and dusted this is the final push\nnow to the finish so I just had the best\npower nap in here I just got my quilt\nfrom out of my\nhandlebar bag\nand I feel so much better I was falling\nasleep on my bike so this was the last\npush to the finish it seemed very Out Of\nReach at this moment in time my body ACH\nand felt weak I was dreaming of a long\nsleep and my saddle SES were causing me\nproblems I even thought I was\nhallucinating when I saw a tree full of\ngoats I delve deep for the next 2 Days\nin order to get to that finish line so\nI've just got to the top of this big\nViewpoint and you can see the sea you\ncan see the\nocean and that just changed the game for\nme I've been feeling quite sluggish\ntoday lacking\nenergy and uh thinking there's a long\nway to go I don't know if I'm going to\nmake it and just seeing that sea has\nbrought me some\nNew\nHope it has been such a hot\nday and it's been interesting listening\nto the other Riders\nviews how they're\nfeeling with\nonly two and a half days left till the\ncut off and everyone claims that they're\nfeeling stressed after a week of riding\nconstantly we were now left with over\n100 miles until the Finish which created\na ton of pressure but also\nexcitement it's the hope it kills you\nyeah it's the\nhope quote of the\ntrip we spent 12 km trekking through\nthick sand which was barely ridable with\nthe aim of get into a shell garage for\nsome food after trying my hardest to get\nthere it turned out it was closed\nand forced me and other Riders to sleep\nthere that night so we could resupply in\nthe morning for our final full day of\nthe\nrace this was a WI\nI'm currently cycling up Paradise Valley\nwhich is this beautiful Gorge and this\nhuge Road climb I've got less than 2\ndays to finish this race and there still\na long way to go there a lot of climbing\ninvolved and this is one of the\nsignificant passes at the end to get\nover luckily it's on the road but it is\nso hot\nI just feel like I haven't got loads of\nenergy and I've sort of just been trying\nto eat as much as I can but trying to\nget the same amount of calories that\nyou're putting out each day is difficult\nright the only ways forward I guess\nonwards and upwards is a very very steep\npath and you can see just the tears\ngoing up this\nmountain hopefully hopefully when we get\nto the top be able to see the sea and\nthat will give me a bit of\nHope the ocean eventually came into view\nand then after a little while longer I\nwas riding alongside it as I rode on the\nhome\nstraight this final day felt like an\neternity and I laid my bivvy down in the\ndirt by the side of the road multiple\ntimes trying to rejuvenate my shrim\nuntil I could see the walls of esera the\nfinish of the Atlas mountain race after\n8 Days 13 hours and 50 minutes I made it\nwhich I couldn't quite believe the week\nfelt like two and it was hard to digest\nthat it was all over feeling a mix of\nemotions after it being so full on for\nwhat seemed like eternity it felt weird\njust to slow down and just be\nit was the after party for the first\nsilver amount race and I it was the\nfirst race I ever organized it was this\nhairbrained idea to do a race in kgus\nand I thought nobody would want to come\nwe turned into this whole series now and\nwhen I was at the after party sh and\nRich came over and they said if you'd\nlike to do another race somewhere I\nthink Morocco could be a good place to\ndo it and Morocco sure was a good place\nto do it I finished the race and left\nMorocco behind but it took me weeks for\nmy body to fully regain its strength and\nmentally recover as well as adapt into a\nnew routine again until next time",
