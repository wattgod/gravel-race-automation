You get rolling farmland, forest roads, and a genuine community vibe without the crowds or hype of bigger events.

It's volunteer-run, affordable, and has that authentic small-race feel where everyone knows each other by the end.",

Do expect friendly volunteers, beautiful countryside, and a race that feels like riding with friends. Perfect for testing fitness or enjoying a weekend adventure without breaking the bank."
