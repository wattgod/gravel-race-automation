You get rolling farmland, forest roads, and a genuine community vibe without the crowds or hype of bigger events.

It's volunteer-run, affordable, and has that authentic small-race feel where everyone knows each other by the end.",

Do expect friendly volunteers, beautiful countryside, and a race that feels like riding with friends. Perfect for testing fitness or enjoying a weekend adventure without breaking the bank."

      "elevation": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Rolling hills through North Frontenac and Lanark Highlands create steady climbing rather than explosive ascents.

        "explanation": "The 2024 event experienced \"not ideal\" weather conditions that still allowed riders to have \"an amazing time\" according to race coverage.

      "altitude": {

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Old logging roads wind through forests with views of Dalhousie Lake, taking riders through terrain where \"maple syrup is the most abundant natural resource.\" The single lane treed roads offer countryside exploration, though the adventure stays within civilized rural Ontario rather than wilderness territory."

      "prestige": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "As a \"marquee event\" in the Gravel Cup Canada series, it draws regional attention but lacks international recognition. Organized by Brendan Gorman, the race accommodated 112 participants in 2025, making it a solid provincial fixture rather than a destination event."

        "explanation": "The Epic Course men's field spread from Michael Joannisse's winning 3:13:32 to finish times over 6:47:49, indicating primarily recreational participation. With 36 starters and 5 DNFs in the men's Epic, competitive depth remains limited to regional riders."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Three distance options let riders choose their challenge level, while the post-race experience at an artisan cheese farm by the Mississippi River with waterfalls delivers memorable value. The scenic venue and quality post-ride meals likely exceed typical entry fee expectations for Canadian gravel racing."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Rural Mississippi Station, Ontario offers affordable lodging and dining options far from tourist pricing. The remote location requires driving but keeps accommodation costs low, with the biggest expense being the artisan cheese farm venue that enhances rather than gouges the race experience."
