The 2024 event experienced \"not ideal\" weather conditions that still allowed riders to have \"an amazing time\" according to race coverage.

          "transcript": "The fluorescent lights in courtroom 3B\nhummed at exactly 60 hertz. It was a\ndirty sound, a low electrical grumble\nthat most people tuned out, but I had\nspent 40 years making a living by\nlistening to things other people\nignored. I heard the hum. I heard the\nbaleiff's leather belt creek as he\nshifted his weight by the door. I heard\nthe vibrating buzz of a cell phone in a\npurse two rows back, muffled by leather\nand tissue packs. And I heard her.\nDeanna sat across the aisle at the\npetitioner's table. She wore a navy\nblazer she had bought specifically for\nthis morning. I knew it was new because\nwhen she walked past me, I saw the price\ntag still tucked inside the collar.\nDetails. You miss them when you are\ntalking, but you catch everything when\nyou are just listening. She gripped the\nedge of the wooden table so hard her\nknuckles looked like polished white\nstones. Her breathing was shallow. 22\nbreaths per minute. I counted\nautomatically. That is the frequency of\npanic. My son sat next to her. Brett, he\nwas wearing the polo shirt from the Ford\ndealership where he worked the one with\nthe blue oval logo on the chest. His\nhands were in his lap. For the last 6\nweeks, whenever the tension rose in a\nroom, Brett would ring his hands\ntogether a nervous tick that sounded\nlike dry skin rasping against dry skin.\nBut today, his hands were still. They\nlay flat on his thighs, heavy and\nmotionless. Judge Carolyn Frick adjusted\nher reading glasses. She was a woman who\nwasted no time. She looked at Deanna's\ntable, then at mine, and finally at the\nlarge flat screen monitor that had been\nwheeled into the center of the room.\n\"This is a contested guardianship\nhearing,\" Judge Frick said. Her voice\nwas dry, no reverb. \"Before we proceed\nwith testimony, I have been presented\nwith a motion from respondents council\nto admit audiovisisual evidence.\" My\nlawyer stood up. Arlo flag moved slower\nthan most men his age, but he spoke with\nthe weight of a freight train. Your\nhonor, this compilation was gathered\nover a 5-week period by my client, Mr.\nPuit, in his capacity as a resident of\nthe household. Deanna's lawyer shot up\nlike a spring. Objection, your honor. We\nhave not had adequate time to review\nthis material. My client has a right to\nprivacy in her own home. Judge Frick\nlooked over her glasses. Indiana is a\none party consent state counselor. Mr.\nPuit lived in the home. He was present\nin the shared living spaces where these\nrecordings took place. I've reviewed the\nchain of custody documentation. The\nevidence is admitted. She turned to\nArlo. You may proceed, Mr. Flag. Arlo\nnodded to the baiff. Your honor, before\nwe hear testimony about my client's\nalleged confusion and incompetence, I\nthink it is best if the court sees what\nmy client heard. Judge Frick sat back.\nLet us watch the family video. The word\nvideo landed in the quiet room like a\ndropped glass. I heard the change in\nDeanna's intake of breath instantly. A\nsharp hitch, a glottle stop. She turned\nto her lawyer and whispered something,\nand the frequency of that whisper was\nhigh, tight, and cornered. I sat\nperfectly still. My hands rested on the\nsmooth wood of the defendant's table.\nFor 67 years, I had been the man in the\nback room, the guy behind the mixing\nboard, the invisible engineer making\nother people's voices clear. I adjusted\nlevels. I removed static. I made sure\nthe audience heard what mattered. Today,\nthe voice they were about to hear was\nhers. And the audience was a judge with\nthe power to sign my life away. The\nscreen flickered to life. I didn't watch\nthe monitor. I watched Deanna. I wanted\nto see her face when the first wave of\nsound hit her. I wanted to see the\nmoment she realized that the old man she\ntreated like furniture had been\nrecording the broadcast of her life. Her\nlips parted. A sound escaped her throat,\nraw and unpolished. It was the beginning\nof a scream that she clamped down on\nbefore it could fully form. But I heard\nit. I heard the vibration of a wall\ncoming down. I closed my eyes. The\nexhaustion hit me then, a physical\nweight pressing on my shoulders. It\nwasn't satisfaction. Not yet. It was\njust the heavy relief of finally setting\ndown a burden I had carried in silence.\n6 weeks ago, I was not sitting in a\ncourtroom. I was lying on a kitchen\nfloor. I was dying. I was reaching for a\nsmall orange plastic bottle that was\nonly 3 ft away, but it might as well\nhave been on the moon. 6 weeks ago, a\nwoman looked down at me and said two\nwords that rearranged every molecule of\nwho I was. But to understand the\nfrequency of that moment, you have to\nunderstand the silence that came before\nit. You have to go back to the garage,\nto the cold concrete, to the morning. I\nwas still just a ghost in my own house.\nMy room was a converted garage on the\nnorth side of the house. The floor was\nconcrete, covered by a thin rug that did\nnothing to stop the Indiana winter from\nseeping through my socks. It smelled of\nold motor oil and the lavender detergent\nDeanna used on the sheets, a combination\nthat always made my nose itch. It was\n6:30 on a Tuesday morning, week zero. I\nsat on the edge of my single bed. My\nhands moved slowly. I picked up my\nhearing aids from the nightstand. They\nwere beige, ugly little things, standard\nissue from the VA. I turned them over in\nmy palm. The truth was, I didn't need\nthem as much as everyone thought I did.\nMy hearing loss was mild, mostly in the\nupper registers, but the aids amplified\neverything. With them in, I could hear\nthe furnace cycle on in the basement. I\ncould hear the refrigerator compressor\nkick in from the kitchen. Without them,\nthe world was soft, muffled, peaceful. I\nput them in anyway, slowly. I never\nrushed this part. It was part of the\ncostume, the slow, fumbling old man. On\nthe small table next to my bed sat a\nSony cassette player from 2009.\nI pressed the play button. The mechanics\nclicked loud in the quiet room. A solid\nanalog sound. Tape hiss filled the air.\nThen a voice. I feel so bad. I've got a\nworried mind. Dela, my wife. She was\nsinging in our old kitchen 14 years ago.\nI'd recorded it on a Saturday morning\nwhile she was making pancakes. She was\nslightly flat on the high notes and she\nmissed the rhythm in the bridge, but the\ngrain in her voice was warm and real. It\nwas the only recording I had left where\nshe wasn't talking about doctors or\ninsurance. I closed my eyes and let the\nfrequency of her voice wash over me. For\n3 minutes, I wasn't a widowerower living\nin his son's garage. I was 45. The\ncoffee was brewing and Dela was laughing\nbecause she had caught me holding the\nmicrophone. Bang, bang, bang. The wall\nshook. Dad, turn that down.\nSome of us are trying to sleep,\"\nDeanna's voice, muffled by the drywall,\nbut the sharpness cut through. The spell\nbroke. The kitchen vanished. Dela\nvanished. I reached out and pressed\nstop. The click echoed. \"Sorry,\" I\nwhispered to the empty room. I waited 10\nminutes before going out. I had learned\nthe rhythm of the house. \"Diana needed\nher coffee before she could tolerate my\npresence, and Brett needed to be in the\nshower before I could use the hallway\nwithout being in the way. I was a guest\nwho had overstayed his welcome by 18\nmonths. When I finally walked into the\nkitchen, the air was thick with the\nsmell of brewing coffee and burnt toast.\nThe kitchen was open plan connected to\nthe living room by a large island. It\nwas modern gray and white with stainless\nsteel appliances that beeped whenever\nyou touched them. Deanna stood at the\nisland scrolling through her phone. She\ndidn't look up. She wore her scrubs for\nthe dental office pink and tight. Her\nhair was straight and brown with blonde\nhighlights that looked sharp under the\nrecessed lighting. \"Morning, Deanna?\" I\nsaid. She hummed something that wasn't\nquite a word. She tapped the screen of\nher phone, frowned, then tapped again.\n\"Is Brett up?\" I asked. \"In the shower,\"\nshe said. Her voice was flat. No\nmodulation. She wasn't talking to a\nperson. She was talking to an appliance\nthat was making a noise. I moved to the\ncabinet to get a mug. My movements were\ndeliberate. I kept my head down. I was\nthe invisible man.\nI poured my coffee and took it to the\nsmall table in the corner, away from the\nisland, away from her space. Deanna's\nphone rang. She answered it on the\nsecond ring, her voice shifting\ninstantly into a bright theatrical\nsoprano. Hey girl. No, I'm just getting\nready. Honestly, it's been a morning\nalready. She glanced at me. I was\nstaring into my black coffee. I didn't\nmove. I didn't react. To her, I was just\na shape in a flannel shirt. She lowered\nher voice, but not much. She didn't\nthink she needed to whisper. She thought\nthe hearing aids were just decoration.\nYeah, he's sitting right there.\nHonestly, Crystal, he doesn't even hear\nhalf of what we say. It's like talking\nto furniture. I took a sip of coffee. It\nwas hot, bitter. I let it burn my\ntongue. Furniture. That was a new one.\nUsually, I was the burden or the\nproject. Furniture implied something\nuseful. I didn't say anything. I just\nsat there and listened to the\nrefrigerator hum at 120 hertz. waiting\nfor my son to come out and start the\nday.\nThat evening, the air in the house felt\nheavy. The barometer had dropped,\npressing down on the roof. We were\neating dinner meatloaf and mashed\npotatoes. Deanna's meatloaf was dense\nheavy on the garlic to mask the lack of\nseasoning. The only sounds were the\nscrape of forks against ceramic plates,\nB flat, a harsh scratching frequency. In\nthe living room, the TV was on, a game\nshow. Canned laughter bubbled up every\n30 seconds, peeking at 440 hertz. I cut\na piece of meatloaf. My hand felt\nstrange, heavy, like I was moving it\nthrough water. I looked at my fork. The\nmetal seemed to vibrate. Brett was\nsitting across from me. He was scrolling\non his phone, his face bathed in the\nblue light of the screen. He chewed\nrhythmically, eyes never leaving the\ndevice. Deanna was at the sink, her back\nto us rinsing a pot. The water roared\nagainst the stainless steel. I took a\nbreath, but the air didn't seem to reach\nthe bottom of my lungs. It started as a\ntightness in the center of my chest. Not\npain, not yet, just pressure, like\nsomeone had inflated a balloon inside my\nrib cage and refused to stop. Then the\ntingling started. It began in my\nfingertips, cold and prickly, and washed\nup my left arm in a wave. Wrist, elbow,\nshoulder. My fork clattered onto the\nplate. The sound was loud. Brett looked\nup, blinking. Dad. I tried to speak, but\nmy jaw felt locked. The pressure in my\nchest turned into a vice. A giant iron\nhand squeezing the life out of my heart.\nThe room tilted. The white lights of the\nkitchen flared, burning holes in my\nvision. My hand went to my shirt pocket.\nThe nitroglycerin. I always kept the\nsmall bottle there. Always. Since the\nfirst angina attack four years ago, my\nfingers fumbled with the fabric. The\npocket was flat, empty. My heart\nhammered against my ribs and erratic,\nterrified drum solo. I patted the other\npocket. Nothing. Panic, cold and sharp,\nspiked in my gut. I looked at the\nkitchen counter. There, the orange\nprescription bottle. It was sitting next\nto the toaster 6 ft away. I must have\nleft it there after breakfast. I never\ndid that. I was meticulous. But there it\nwas. I tried to stand up. I needed to\nget to the counter. The chair legs\nscraped violently against the tile\nscreeching wood. My legs buckled. They\njust folded underneath me like wet\ncardboard. I went down. My knees hit the\ntile first, then my hands. I was on all\nfours, gasping for air that wouldn't\ncome. I stared at the grout lines\nbetween the beige tiles. I focused on\nthe gray grit of the grout. Dad Brett's\nvoice was high, panicked. I heard\nfootsteps. Deanna turned off the water.\nThe sudden silence was deafening. My\npills. I wheezed. I lifted my right arm,\npointing toward the counter. My fingers\nwouldn't stop shaking. Deanna walked\nover. I saw her shoes, pink sneakers\nwith white soles. She stopped next to\nme. Brett was there, too, hovering\nuseless. His hands were ringing\ntogether. Deanna, get his pills. He's\nhaving an attack. Deanna didn't move\ntoward me. She moved toward the counter.\nShe picked up the orange bottle. I\nlooked up from the floor. She looked\nenormous, a towering figure backlit by\nthe recessed lights. Her face was in\nshadow, but I could see her eyes. They\nweren't panicked. They weren't scared.\nThey were calculating.\nShe held the bottle in her hand. She\nturned it over, looking at the label.\n\"Give it to him,\" Brett shouted. He took\na step toward her. \"Hold on,\" Deanna\nsaid. Her voice was calm. \"Too calm. He\nneeds his medication.\" Brett's voice\ncracked. \"I said hold on, Brett,\" she\nsnapped. The authority in her voice\nstopped him cold. He froze. His mouth\nsnapped shut. He looked at her, then at\nme, then back at her. His hands squeezed\neach other, knuckles white. Deanna\nlooked down at me. I was gasping, my\nchest burning like it was filled with\nbroken glass. I reached out to her,\n\"Please.\" She didn't hand me the bottle.\nShe didn't call 911. She leaned down\njust a little. She looked at me with an\nexpression of mild distaste, like I was\na stain on her clean floor that she\nhadn't gotten around to scrubbing yet.\nShe smiled. It wasn't a big smile. It\nwas small, tight, satisfied. Gasp,\nloser, the words were whispered.\n180 hertz low controlled intimate gasp\nloser. She wasn't shouting. Shouting is\nfor emotion. Whispering is for choices.\nMy vision began to tunnel. The edges\nturned black. The pain in my chest was\nabsolute now. A blinding white noise\nthat drowned out the TV, the\nrefrigerator, everything. I looked at\nBrett, my son, the boy I had taught to\nride a bike. The boy who used to sit on\nmy lap and listen to the world through\nheadphones. He was standing 5t away. He\nwas watching. His hands were ringing. He\nwasn't moving toward the phone. He\nwasn't moving toward the pills. He was\njust standing there paralyzed by the\nwoman holding the plastic bottle. The\nlast thing I saw before the darkness\ntook me was Deanna's shoes, pink and\nclean. And the last thing I heard was\nthe sound of my own heart stuttering,\ntrying to find a rhythm that was no\nlonger there. Then silence. The sound\nreturned before the light. A siren 700\nhertz rising and falling. a standard\nambulance siren. It was close, loud. I\nwas moving. The floor was gone. I was on\na stretcher. There was a mask over my\nface, forcing air into my lungs. I\nopened my eyes. The ceiling of the\nambulance flashed past. A paramedic was\nleaning over me, adjusting an IV line.\nSomething hard was pressed into my hand.\nI looked down. My fingers were curled\naround the orange pill bottle. Brett\nmust have put it there. After After\nAfter Deanna walked away, after she\nfinally let him call, he had put the\npills in my hand to make it look right,\nto make it look like I had them all\nalong. The paramedics saw me looking.\nStay with us, sir. We're almost there. I\nclosed my eyes again. The siren wailed.\nI was alive. The realization was cold\nmetallic. I was alive, but the man who\nhad fallen on the kitchen floor was\ngone. The man who tried to be invisible,\nwho tried to be furniture, who tried to\nkeep the piece he had died on that tile.\nSomething else had taken his place,\nsomething sharper, something that\nlistened not just to hear, but to\nrecord. Deanna thought I was just\nstatic, background noise. She was wrong.\nI was the frequency that was about to\nshatter the glass. Part two. I woke up\nto the sound of my own heart being\nbroadcast to the room. It was a steady\nrhythmic beep, 72 beats per minute. I\ncounted it automatically before I even\nopened my eyes. It was a habit from\nthree decades in audio engineering. You\nalways check the baseline frequency\nfirst. My chest felt bruised, a deep,\ndull ache behind the sternum where the\ndoctors had done their work, but the\nrhythm was consistent. I opened my eyes.\nThe room at St. Elizabeth Hospital was\nwashed in gray morning light. The air\nsmelled of rubbing alcohol and that\ndistinct metallic scent of industrial\nlaundry. Brett was asleep in the\nvisitor's chair. His chin was resting on\nhis chest, his mouth slightly open. He\nlooked younger when he slept, the lines\nof worry around his eyes smoothing out.\nFor a second, he looked like the boy who\nused to fall asleep in the vocal booth\nwhile I finished a late night mix. But\nDeanna was not asleep. She was standing\nat the foot of my bed speaking to a man\nin a white coat. Dr. Nolan. I recognized\nhim from the emergency room. Deanna was\nperforming. There was no other word for\nit. She stood with her posture slightly\nslumped, hands clasped over her heart.\nHer voice was pitched a full octave\nhigher than her natural speaking\nregister, a breathy, trembling vibr that\nscreamed devotion. \"We have been so\nworried, doctor,\" she said. She let out\na long, shaky exhale. \"I mean, honestly,\nI told Brett weeks ago that we needed to\nget him checked out. He has been so\nconfused lately, forgetting things, not\neating right. I lay still. The sheets\nwere scratchy against my legs. I watched\nDr. Nolan nod sympathetically, making\nnotes on his tablet. He was buying it.\nWhy wouldn't he? She was the young,\ncapable daughter-in-law taking care of\nthe stubborn old widowerower. It was a\nstory everyone knew, but you know how\nthe elderly get. Deanna continued\nlowering her voice to a conspiratorial\nwhisper that carried perfectly to my\nears. Stubborn. He insists he is fine\neven when he is clearly declining. I\ncleared my throat. The sound was dry\nlike sandpaper on wood. Mr. Puit.\nDr. Nolan said, turning to me with a\nprofessional smile. Good to see you\nawake. How are you feeling? Better, I\nrasped. Deanna jumped in before I could\ntake a second breath. He says that, but\nhonestly, doctor, at home, he barely\nremembers to take his pills. It is a\nconstant battle. I remember, I said. My\nvoice was stronger this time. I looked\ndirectly at her. Deanna let out a light\ntinkling laugh. She reached out and\nplaced her hand on my forearm. Her\nfingers were cold. I felt them tighten\njust a fraction of warning masquerading\nas comfort. See, this is exactly what I\nmean, she said to the doctor, shaking\nher head affectionately. He does not\neven realize he was not carrying them\nlast night. He thinks he took them, but\nthe bottle was on the counter. I felt\nthe blood heat up in my neck. I wasn't\ncarrying them because they weren't in my\npocket. They weren't in my pocket\nbecause someone moved them. But I looked\nat Dr. Nolan's face and I saw the way he\nwas looking at me. He saw a 67year-old\nman with gray hair and a heart\ncondition. He saw a patient who had\ncollapsed on a kitchen floor. He didn't\nsee a witness. He saw a liability. If I\nargued now, if I accused her of hiding\nmy medication, I would sound paranoid. I\nwould sound exactly like the confused,\ndeclining old man she was describing.\nSo, I did the only thing I could do. I\nclosed my mouth. I lay back against the\npillow and let my eyes drift half shut.\nI watched Deanna through my eyelashes. I\nstopped listening to her words and\nstarted listening to her cadence. the\nmicro pauses before she answered a\nquestion. The slight acceleration in\npitch when she lied. Twice in three\nsentences, she used the word honestly.\nHonestly, doctor, he says that, but\nhonestly, it was a tell, a verbal tick.\nIn audio editing, we call that a\ntransient spike, a sudden burst of\nenergy that signals a distortion. I\nwatched her charm the doctor, watched\nher stroke my arm with her cold fingers,\nand I made a decision. I would not\nargue. I would not fight. Not here. I\nwould fade. They kept me for 2 days.\nObservation, they called it. Deanna went\nto work. Brett went to the dealership. I\nwas left alone with the hum of the\nventilation system and a nurse named\nGloria who smelled like peppermint and\nfatigue. I spent the hours counting\nceiling tiles. 24 tiles across, 24 tiles\ndown, 576 tiles total. It was a way to\nkeep my mind sharp, a way to organize\nthe chaos. I ran the scenarios in my\nhead. Option A, I leave. I walk out of\nthis hospital and go to a motel. I call\na taxi, go to the bank, and disappear.\nResult, Deanna wins. She tells Brett I\nwandered off confused and dangerous. She\nfiles for emergency guardianship\nimmediately. I lose my son. I lose the\nonly family I have left. Option B. I\ntell Brett the truth. I tell him his\nwife stood over me and watched me gasp\nfor air. Result, he doesn't believe me.\nOr worse, he believes me. but is too\nweak to do anything about it. Deanna\nspins it as a hallucination brought on\nby hypoxia. The doctor backs her up. I\nend up in a psych ward. Option C. I go\nback to the house. I eat her food. I\nsleep in the garage. I become the\nfurniture she thinks I am. Gloria came\nin to check my vitals on Thursday\nafternoon. She wrapped the blood\npressure cuff around my arm. Your\ndaughter-in-law sure is attentive.\nGloria said she calls the nurse's\nstation every few hours. She does? I\nasked. I kept my voice flat. Oh yes, she\nis very worried about your discharge\nplan. Asking if we think you need a\nprofessional care assessment. My pulse\nskipped a beat. The monitor beeped a\nlittle faster. A care assessment. That\nwas the first legal step toward\nguardianship. Dela's mother had gone\nthrough it. It was the paper trail you\nneeded to prove that someone could no\nlonger make their own decisions. Deanna\nwasn't waiting. She was already building\nthe file. She is very thorough, I said.\nGloria smiled, oblivious. You're lucky\nto have family who cares that much. Most\npeople in here just have a TV remote.\nI looked up at the 576 ceiling tiles. I\nthought about the equipment sitting in\nboxes in my garage, microphones that\ncould pick up a whisper at 50 ft,\nrecorders that captured audio at 96 kHz.\nI didn't need a motel. I needed a\nstudio. I chose option C. Saturday\nnight, week one. I was back in the\nhouse. The living room was washed in the\nflickering blue light of the 60-in\ntelevision. Brett was sprawled on the\nsofa watching college basketball. The\nvolume was cranked up. The crowd noise\nwas a wash of white noise around 2,000\nhertz punctuated by the squeak of\nsneakers on a court. I sat in my\nrecliner in the corner. I had a book\nopen on my lap, a thriller I had read 3\nyears ago. I hadn't turned a page in 20\nminutes. I was wearing my hearing aids.\nThis was the variable Deanna didn't\naccount for. She assumed that without\nthe aids I was deaf. She assumed that\nwith them I was barely functioning. The\ntruth was my hearing loss was selective.\nI had lost the high frequencies, the\nshimmer of symbols, the chirp of\ncrickets. But the mid-range, the range\nof the human voice, I could still hear\nit fine. The aids didn't just restore\nthe highs. They amplified everything.\nThey acted like a compressor on a mixing\nboard, boosting the quiet sounds and\nleveling out the loud ones. With the\naids in and the ambient noise of the TV\nmasking the silence, I was effectively a\nsurveillance device.\nDeanna was in the kitchen. The house was\nan open concept, the kind that was\npopular in the early 2000s. No wall\nseparated the kitchen from the living\nroom, just a large granite island. She\nwas standing at that island maybe 12 ft\naway from my chair. She was chopping\nvegetables. The knife hit the cutting\nboard with a sharp, rhythmic thwack. She\nwas on her phone. She wasn't whispering.\nWhy would she? The TV was loud. The old\nman in the corner was reading a book. He\nwas harmless. He was confused. He was\nfurniture. \"No, Crystal listened,\"\nDeanna said. Her voice cut through the\nbasketball commentary like a knife. The\nhospital visit was perfect. The doctor\nalready wrote cognitive concern in the\nnotes because of what I told him. I\nstared at the word protocol on page 42\nof my book. I breathed in for four\ncounts, out for four counts. 14 breaths\nper minute. Keep the heart rate steady.\nThere was a pause while Crystal spoke on\nthe other end. Then Deanna laughed. It\nwas a sharp jagged sound. 6 months. Girl\ntry three. I already have the\nguardianship forms printed. Once I file\nthe court sets a hearing once I am his\nlegal guardian. I control everything.\nthe pension, the social security, the\nhouse. My fingers gripped the edges of\nthe book. The paper felt dry and\nbrittle. Three months. She was giving me\n90 days before she erased me. Another\npause. Deanna stopped chopping. She\nleaned against the counter. His house.\nOh, it is in probate limbo. Dela's name\nwas on it, too. And this dumbass never\nupdated the title after she died. Once I\nhave guardianship, I petition to sell as\nhis fiduciary. Brett won't fight me. she\nsnorted, a sound of pure derision. Brett\ndoes not fight anything. That is why I\nmarried him. The crowd on the TV roared\nas someone scored a three-pointer. Brett\nclapped his hands, cheering. Dad, did\nyou see that? Brett yelled over his\nshoulder. I looked up. I adjusted my\nglasses. I forced a confused smile onto\nmy face. What? I asked who scored? Brett\nshook his head, turning back to the\nscreen. Never mind, Dad. In the kitchen,\nDeanna covered the mouthpiece of her\nphone. She looked at me with a sweet,\npitying smile. \"You okay, Dad?\" \"I'm\nfine, Deanna,\" I said. \"Just reading.\"\nShe nodded and turned back to her,\nchopping back to her call back to\nplotting the demolition of my life. I\nlooked down at my hands. They were\ntrembling. Not from fear, from a cold,\nhard rage that felt like ice water in my\nveins. Dumbass. That is why I married\nhim. She had made a mistake. a fatal\nacoustic error. She assumed the signal\nto noise ratio in this room was in her\nfavor. She thought the TV drowned her\nout. She forgot who she was talking to.\nI closed the book. I stood up slowly,\ngroaning a little for effect. I'm going\nto turn in, I said. Night, Dad. Brett\ncalled out without looking away from the\ngame. Sleep tight, Deanna said. I walked\npast the kitchen island. I could smell\nher body spray, that cloying vanilla\nscent. I walked down the short hallway\nto the garage door. I opened it and\nstepped into the cool, quiet air of my\nroom. I locked the door. I sat on the\nbed and looked at the stack of cardboard\nboxes in the corner. The ones Deanna\ncalled junk. The ones she wanted to\ndonate to Goodwill.\nI knelt down. My knees cracked, but I\ndidn't care. I pulled the top flap open.\nInside, nestled in dark gray foam, was\nmy Zoom H6 handy recorder. It looked\nlike a piece of alien technology black\nsleek with a large XY microphone capsule\nmounted on top. Next to it were coiled\nXLR cables and two lavalier microphones,\neach one no bigger than a shirt button.\nI picked up the recorder. It was heavy\nsolid. I pressed the power button. The\nsmall LCD screen glowed to life. The red\nstandby light blinked at me. I put on\nthe headphones. The world narrowed down\nto the sound of the room tone, the hum\nof the furnace, the faint murmur of the\nTV through the wall. I adjusted the gain\non channel one. I watched the levels\ndance on the screen. Green, yellow. I\nwasn't a lawyer. I wasn't a fighter. I\nwas an old man with a bad heart and a\nson who couldn't stand up for himself.\nBut I knew how to capture a signal. I\npicked up one of the lavalier mics and\nrolled the tiny black capsule between my\nthumb and forefinger. It was small\nenough to hide in a collar, small enough\nto clip under a table ledge, small\nenough to be invisible. Deanna wanted a\nbroadcast. I would give her one. I hit\nthe record button. Testing, I whispered.\nOne, two. Testing. The bars on the\nscreen jumped. The recording had begun.\nPart three. The walk to downtown\nLafayette took 40 minutes. It used to\ntake me 20. I told Deanna I was going\nfor a stroll. Just getting some air, I\nsaid. Doctor's orders. She barely looked\nup from her iPad at the kitchen island.\nShe just waved a hand, a gesture that\nmeant go away as much as it meant\ngoodbye. \"Don't overdo it, Dad,\" she\ncalled out. Her voice was light,\nunconcerned. She liked it when I\nwandered. It fit her narrative. The\nconfused old man shuffling aimlessly\naround the neighborhood. The air was\nbiting. February in Indiana is not kind\nto old bones or damaged hearts. The wind\ncut through my flannel jacket, finding\nthe spaces between the buttons. I kept\nmy head down, watching the cracks in the\nsidewalk, counting my steps. One, two,\nthree, breathe. One, two, three,\nbreathe. I needed to calibrate myself.\nWillis studio was tucked into a\nconverted storefront on Main Street,\nwedged between a failing antique shop\nand a bakery that smelled of yeast and\nsugar. The sign on the glass was peeling\ngold leaf K's audio production. I pushed\nthe door open. A bell jingled overhead.\nThe smell hit me first. Stale coffee old\nvinyl and the warm, distinct scent of\noverheating tube amplifiers. It was the\nsmell of my entire adult life. Willow\nwas behind the glass partition of the\nmain booth. She was wearing a bright\norange scarf that looked like it could\nstrangle a bear and she was shouting\ninto a talkback microphone. No, Terry,\nyou are popping your peas. Back off the\nmic. 3 in. She looked up, saw me\nstanding in the doorway. Her mouth\nstopped moving. She took her finger off\nthe talk back button. She didn't smile.\nWill Karns didn't do polite smiles. She\nmarched out of the booth, slammed the\nheavy soundproof door behind her, and\nstood there with her hands on her hips.\nShe looked me up and down, inspecting\nthe gray in my skin the way my clothes\nhung loose on my frame. You look like\nhammered Norm, she said. Nice to\nsee you, too, Willa, I said. She pointed\na finger at my chest. 18 months. 18\nmonths without a phone call, without a\ntext. Dela would rise from her grave and\nkill you herself if she saw you right\nnow. Dela would kill a lot of people\nright now, I said.\nThe anger drained out of Will's face\ninstantly. She knew me too well. She\nheard the frequency in my voice, the\nflat dead tone that meant I wasn't\njoking. She walked over to the coffee\nstation, poured a mug of black sludge\nthat had probably been sitting there\nsince dawn, and shoved it into my hand.\nSit, she ordered. Tell me. I sat on the\nworn leather sofa that had absorbed the\nnervous sweat of a thousand local\npodcast guests. I held the warm mug with\nboth hands to stop them from shakening.\nAnd I told her I told her about the\nkitchen floor. I told her about the\npills. I told her about the look on\nDeanna's face when she held the bottle\nand whispered those two words. Gasp,\nloser. Willa didn't gasp. She didn't\ncover her mouth in horror. She sat in\nher swivel chair perfectly still,\nwatching me with eyes that were dark and\ndangerous. She was a producer. She was\nused to hearing bad stories. Her job\nwasn't to react. It was to fix the mix.\nWhen I finished, silence filled the\nroom. The only sound was the hum of her\nserver rack in the corner. So, Willis\nsaid. Her voice was quiet. Dangerous.\nShe stood there and watched you die. She\nwatched me almost die. I corrected. Same\nthing to a judge, Willis said. She spun\nher chair around, picked up a pen, and\nclicked it against the desk. Click,\nclick, click. That sound, a metronome of\nthought. You can't go to the police, she\nsaid. It wasn't a question. I have no\nproof. I said it is my word against\nhers. She has the doctor. She is Brett.\nBrett Willis spat the name out like a\npiece of bad gristle. That boy. I\nremember when he used to sit right there\non that rug and color while we edited\nthe 5:00 news. How did he get so weak?\nHe isn't weak, I said, though I knew it\nwas a lie. He's just captured. Willow\nlooked at me hard. So, what are you\ndoing here, Norm? You didn't walk 40\nminutes in the cold just to catch up. I\nneed your studio, I said. What for? I\nneed to check out some equipment. Will\nraised an eyebrow. You have your own\ngear. I know you do. You have that Zoom\nunit and those Sennheiser labs you stole\nfrom the station when you retired. I\nsmiled. It was a thin smile, but it felt\nreal. Borrowed Willa. Permanently\nborrowed. I have them, I said, but I\nneed cables. I need batteries. and I\nneed a place to offload files if if my\nlaptop gets compromised.\nWillow leaned forward. Her eyes searched\nmine. She wasn't looking for fear. She\nwas looking for resolve. What is the\nplan, Norm? That question. Four words.\nNot are you okay? Not you should leave.\nShe asked me for the schematic. I'm\ngoing to record her. I said I'm going to\nstay in that house. I am going to let\nher think I am a scenile old man who\ntalks to furniture. and I'm going to get\nevery single thing she says on tape.\nWillis stared at me for a long beat,\nthen slowly the corners of her mouth\nturned up. Indiana is a one party\nconsent state, she said. I know, I said.\nI have to be in the room. Willis stood\nup. She walked over to a metal cabinet\nin the corner and pulled it open. She\nstarted tossing things onto the sofa\nnext to me. A box of high-end lithium\nbatteries, a bundle of shielded XLR\ncables, a thumb drive with an encryption\nkey. Don't miss, she said. I won't. The\nnext afternoon, I went to work. My room\nwas the only place in the house where I\nhad true privacy, mostly because Deanna\nrefused to enter it unless she was\nsnooping. The concrete floor kept the\ntemperature 10° cooler than the rest of\nthe house, which suited me fine. Cold\nair is better for equipment. I opened\nthe cardboard box in the corner again. I\ntook out the Zoom H6 recorder. I laid it\non the bedspread like a surgeon laying\nout instruments. Then I took out the\nlavalier microphones. They were tiny.\nThe capsules were the size of a black\npepperc corn attached to thin, durable\nwires. I had two of them, professional\ngrade, the kind news anchors wear, the\nkind that can pick up a heartbeat if you\ntape them close enough to the chest. I\ntook my favorite flannel shirt, a faded\nred and gray plaid that I wore 3 days a\nweek. It was soft, thick, and invisible.\nOld men wear flannel. It is part of the\nuniform. I threaded the wire of the\nfirst microphone through the inside of\nthe shirt. I pushed the tiny capsule up\nthrough the button hole of the second\nbutton from the top just below the\ncollar bone. The plaid pattern\ncamouflaged the black dot perfectly.\nUnless you were looking for it, unless\nyou were 6 in away and staring at my\nchest, you would never see it. I slipped\nthe recorder into the inside pocket of\nthe heavy cardigan I wore over the\nshirt. I plugged the wire in. I taped\nthe excess cable to the inside of the\nflannel so it wouldn't rustle when I\nmoved. I put the headphones on. I stood\nin front of the small mirror on the back\nof the door. I looked at the old man in\nthe glass. Gray hair thinning, glasses\nslightly crooked, shoulders slumped.\nTesting, I murmured. The sound in the\nheadphones was crisp, full. I heard the\nfabric of my shirt settling. I heard my\nown breathing. I walked to the door. I\nlistened. The house was quiet. Deanna\nwas at work. Brett was at the\ndealership. I spent the next hour\nmapping the acoustics of the house. I\nwalked from the garage to the kitchen. I\nsat in my recliner. I sat at the dining\ntable. I learned exactly how I needed to\nsit to minimize clothing rustle. I\nlearned that if I leaned my left elbow\non the table, the mic picked up\nconversations from the kitchen island\nperfectly. I learned that if I slumped\nin the recliner, the collar of my shirt\nopened just enough to create a direct\nline of sight for the mic to the rest of\nthe room. I was calibrating myself to be\na walking receiver. Thursday night, week\ntwo. This was the first real test.\nDinner was soup, chicken noodle canned.\nDeanna didn't like to cook on Thursdays.\nWe sat at the round dining table. The\nsetup was intimate, too intimate. Deanna\nsat at the 12:00 position, Brett at\n3:00. I was at 6:00, directly across\nfrom her. The Zoom recorder was in my\ncardigan pocket running. The red light\nwas taped over with black electrical\ntape so it wouldn't glow through the\nfabric. The mic was live at my\ncollarbone. I ate slowly. I made a show\nof it. My hand shook a little as I\nlifted the spoon, a calculated tremor. I\nslurped slightly. It was a disgusting\nsound, wet and sloppy. Deanna grimaced.\nShe looked at Brett and rolled her eyes.\nI saw it. I didn't react. I just wiped\nmy mouth with a napkin and stared\nvacantly at the salt shaker. So Deanna\nsaid, buttering a roll with aggressive\nstrokes. I talked to the lawyer today.\nBrett looked up from his bowl. Yeah.\nWhat did he say? He says the paperwork\nis almost ready, she said. She didn't\nlower her voice. She spoke in her normal\nregister, clear and sharp. To her, I was\njust a fixture in the room, a radio that\nwas turned off. I took another spoonful\nof soup. Slurp. Deanna didn't even look\nat me. She leaned in toward Brett. Once\nI file the petition, the court assigns a\nhearing within 30 days. It moves fast.\nBrett shifted in his chair. He looked\nuncomfortable. 30 days? That seems\nquick. Are we sure he's ready for that?\nDeanna laughed. It wasn't a happy sound.\nBrett looked at him. She gestured toward\nme with her butter knife. He is eating\nsoup like a toddler. He won't even\nunderstand what is happening. We are\ndoing this for his own good. Someone has\nto protect the assets. I chewed a piece\nof soggy carrot. I stared at the table,\nkeeping my expression blank, slack jawed\ninside. My mind was racing checking\nlevels. Her voice is direct, no reverb,\ngood signal to noise ratio. The spoon\nsound is a bit loud. I need to time my\neating between her sentences. But dad,\nBrett started, but nothing. Deanna\nsnapped. She dropped the knife onto her\nplate. Clatter. Do you want to lose the\nhouse? Do you want the state to take his\npension to pay for some state-run\nfacility? Or do you want us to handle\nit? Brett looked down at his soup. He\nmumbled something I couldn't hear. What\nDeanna asked? I said, \"Okay,\" Brett\nwhispered. \"Good,\" Deanna said. She\npicked up her water glass. \"Honestly, it\nis going to be a relief once I have the\npower of attorney. We can finally stop\nworrying about money.\" I finished my\nsoup. I pushed the bowl away. \"That was\ngood, thank you,\" I said. My voice was\nraspy, weak. Deanna smiled at me. The\nsmile didn't reach her eyes. It stopped\nat her teeth. \"You are welcome, Dad. I'm\nglad you liked it.\" I stood up,\nshuffling my feet. I'm going to rest my\neyes. I walked back to my room. The\nhallway seemed longer than usual. My\nheart was pounding a heavy thuting\nagainst my ribs that the microphone\nsurely picked up. I locked the door. I\nsat on the bed and pulled the recorder\nout of my pocket. I stopped the\nrecording. I plugged the USB cable into\nmy laptop. I opened the file. The\nwaveform appeared on the screen, a\njagged blue mountain range of sound. I\nput on my headphones and pressed play.\nHe won't even understand what is\nhappening. Her voice filled my ears.\nCrystal clear digital stereo\nhighfidelity. Honestly, it is going to\nbe a relief. I saved the file. I sat\nback in the dark. The blue light of the\nlaptop screen illuminated the dust modes\ndancing in the air. I had her. This\nwasn't just a conversation. This was a\nconfession. She had admitted to the\ntimeline. She had admitted to the\nmotivation. And she had done it while I\nsat 3 ft away eating chicken noodle\nsoup. I looked at the waveform again. It\nwas beautiful. Sharp peaks, deep\nvalleys. It was the shape of truth. One\nrecording. It was a start. But I knew it\nwasn't enough. A lawyer like hers could\nargue context, could argue frustration.\nI needed more. I needed the pattern. I\nneeded the cruelty. I reached for my\ncalendar on the wall. I marked the date\nwith a red X. The collection had begun.\nPart four. The days blurred into a gray\nloop of static and signal. For the next\ntwo weeks, I ceased to be a father or a\nwidowerower. I became a recording device\nwrapped in flannel. I lived my life in\n6-hour shifts governed by the battery\nlife of the Zoom recorder and the\ncapacity of my SD cards. I ate when they\nate. I sat where they sat. I became a\nghost that haunted the furniture of my\nown life. Always present, always silent,\nand always running tape. We called it\nthe collection phase. It was a strange\nkind of game. Deanna moved through the\nhouse with the confidence of a woman who\nbelieves she is the only player on the\nboard. She didn't know the pieces were\nwatching her. Recording number three\nhappened on a Tuesday. I was in the\nrecliner, the newspaper spread open on\nmy lap. I hadn't turned a page in 40\nminutes. The hearing aids were in tune\nto the mid-range. Deanna was in the\nkitchen pacing. I could hear the slap of\nher bare feet on the hardwood. She was\non the phone with Crystal again. Crystal\nwas her sounding board, her accomplice\nin spirit, if not in law. I cannot wait\nto get the new car, Deanna said, her\nvoice carried over the kitchen island,\nbouncing off the granite countertops.\nBrett's pension from Ford is not much,\nhonestly. It barely covers the mortgage,\nbut Norm's social security plus the VA\nsupplement. She paused, listening. Then\nshe laughed. Exactly. That is 3,400 a\nmonth I can redirect. It is just sitting\nin his account. He doesn't spend it. He\nwears the same three shirts and eats\nsoup. It is wasteful. I stared at the\nheadline of the local paper. Local\nschool board debates budget. My finger\ntraced the black ink. $3,400.\nThat was the money Dela and I had saved\nfor travel for the RV trip to the Grand\nCanyon we never took. Now it was a\nmonthly allowance for a new SUV.\nI didn't move. I let the recorder in my\npocket drink it all in. Recording number\nseven was the dinner table. Thursday. I\nhad perfected the art of the old man\nnap. I sat at the table after the meal\nwas cleared. My chin dropped to my\nchest. My breathing heavy and rhythmic.\nI wasn't asleep. I was focusing on the\nacoustic reflection off the dining room\nwall. Deanna and Brett were still\nsitting there.\nYour father is declining. Brett, Deanna\nsaid. Her voice was low, serious, the\ntone of a concerned caregiver. Anyone\ncan see that he left the milk out again\nthis morning. I hadn't left the milk\nout. She had I don't know, Dret said. He\nsounded tired. The scraping of his\nthumbnail against the wood table gave\nhim away. He seems okay sometimes. He\nasked me about the game yesterday.\nDeanna sighed. A longsuffering sound.\nYou don't know that is the problem.\nYou're at work all day. You don't see\nhim staring at the wall. You don't see\nthe confusion. We would be negligent not\nto take over his affairs. Negligent\nBrett. Do you want that on your\nconscience? There was a silence, then\nthe sound of a chair pushing back. You\nare right, Brett whispered. I know you\nare right. That is why I let you handle\nthings. I kept my eyes closed. I felt a\ntear leak out hot and traitorous. I let\nit slide into the collar of my shirt\nright where the microphone was hiding.\nRecording number 12 was the car. We were\ndriving to the cardiologist for my\nfollow-up. Deanna was driving. I sat in\nthe backseat of her Toyota Highlander,\nstaring out the window at the gray\nIndiana slush. I had my head against the\nglass, eyes closed, mouth slightly open.\nTo her, I was asleep. She was on the\nphone with someone from her dental\noffice. The Bluetooth system in the car\nwas loud, but she had switched it to\nhandset mode so I wouldn't hear the\nother person. She didn't think she\nneeded to hide her own voice. \"Yeah, I'm\ntaking him now,\" she said, glancing in\nthe rearview mirror. I saw her eyes\nflick over me, then dismissed me.\nBetween the house equity and his\nretirement accounts, we are looking at\nclose to 400,000.\nShe turned the steering wheel, merging\nonto the highway. The turn signal\nclicked. Tick- tock, tick tock. The man\nhas no idea what he is worth. Honestly,\nit is sad. He is just sitting on a pile\nof cash while we struggle to pay for\ndaycare. It is just resource\nredistribution. Resource redistribution.\nI saved that file the moment we got\nhome. My laptop was filling up. My heart\nwas hardening. But audio was only half\nthe picture. Audio proved intent. Audio\nproved character. But in a court of law,\naudio needed paper to give it weight. I\nneeded the documents. Saturday of week\nthree offered an opening. Brett needed\nnew tires for the truck and Deanna\nwanted to go to the mall in\nIndianapolis. It was an all-day trip.\nThey asked if I wanted to come. I told\nthem my legs were aching. I told them I\njust wanted to watch old movies. Deanna\nlooked relieved. Make sure you lock the\ndoor if you nap, Dad. She said the\nmoment their tail lights disappeared\naround the corner. The clock started. I\nmoved through the silent house. I didn't\nrush. Rushing makes you careless, and\ncarelessness leaves traces. I went\nstraight to the spare bedroom at the end\nof the hall. Deanna called it her home\noffice. It was the only room in the\nhouse she kept locked. I stood in the\nhallway and looked at the door frame. I\nremembered the sound. 3 days ago, I had\nbeen sitting in the living room,\napparently dozing. I heard Deanna walk\nto this door. I heard her pause. I heard\nthe scuff slide of fingers exploring the\ntop of the wooden trim. Then the jingle\nof a key, then the click of the lock.\nPeople are creatures of habit. They hide\nthings in places that feel clever to\nthem, but usually they are just\nconvenient. I reached up to the top of\nthe door frame. My fingers brushed\nthrough dust until they hit cold metal.\nThe key. I pulled it down. It was a\nsmall brass key, probably for a diary or\na filing cabinet, but she used it for\nthe door knob. I inserted it. It turned\nwith a smooth, satisfying thunk. I\nstepped inside. The room smelled of her\nvanilla and stale paper. There was a\nwhite desk, immaculate, a laptop stand.\nAnd in the corner, a beige metal filing\ncabinet. I didn't touch the desk. I went\nfor the cabinet. It wasn't locked.\nArrogance. She locked the room so she\ndidn't feel the need to lock the\ncabinet. I opened the top drawer.\nHanging folders color-coded. I pulled\nout my phone. My hands were steady now.\nI was in the zone. I flipped through the\ntabs. Taxes, mortgage, medical. I found\na folder labeled legal. I opened it.\nInside was a thick stack of papers. The\ntop document was a petition for\nguardianship of an incapacitated adult.\nI looked at the date stamp on the draft.\nOctober 14th. My heart stopped. October\n14th was 2 weeks before my heart attack.\nShe hadn't reacted to a medical\nemergency. She had been planning this\nwhen I was still driving myself to the\ngrocery store. The heart attack wasn't\nthe cause. It was just the accelerant.\nI photographed the document. every page.\nI kept digging. I found bank statements,\ntransfers from our joint account, the\none I used for groceries, into an\naccount under just her name. 200 here,\n500 there. Testing the waters. Then I\nreached the back of the drawer. There\nwas a folder there that looked older\nthan the others. The tab was handwritten\nin blue ink. Langston, Deanna's maiden\nname. I pulled it out. It was thin.\nInside there was a death certificate.\nEarl Thomas Langston. Date of death 5\nyears ago. Cause of death, mocardial\ninfarction, heart attack. Behind that\nwas a copy of a last will in testament.\nIt was short. I, Earl Langston, being of\nsound mind, hereby revoke all prior\nwills. Leave my entire estate real and\npersonal to my granddaughter, Deanna\nLangston. The date on the will was 3\nmonths before he died. There was one\nmore thing. A letter from a lawyer in\nterote reestate settlement. Dear Miss\nLangston, per your instructions, the\nsale of the residence has been\nexpedited. The house was sold 6 weeks\nafter the funeral. My hands started to\nshake. This wasn't just about me. This\nwasn't just a greedy daughter-in-law\nwanting a new car. This was a pattern. I\nphotographed the death certificate, the\nwill, the letter. I put everything back\nexactly as I found it. I aligned the\nedges of the papers. I closed the\ndrawer. I wiped the handle with the hem\nof my shirt to remove prints. I locked\nthe door and put the key back on the\nframe. I went back to my room and sat in\nthe dark. I looked at the photos on my\nphone screen. Earl Langston, a name I\nbarely knew. A man who died of a heart\nattack alone in a house with his\ngranddaughter. I felt a coldness that\nhad nothing to do with the garage floor.\nI wasn't just fighting a thief. I was\nfighting a predator. Monday morning,\nweek three. I told Deanna I was going to\nthe library. She didn't care. I met\nWilla on the corner of Fourth in Maine.\nShe led me to a brick building with a\nfaded awning. We walked up a narrow\nflight of stairs that smelled of floor\nwax and old cigars. The frosted glass\ndoor said Arlo flag attorney at law.\nArlo's office was small, cluttered, and\nreassuringly messy. Stacks of files\nteetered on every surface. A framed law\ndegree from Indiana University hung\ncrookedly on the wall next to a faded\nphoto of a platoon in desert fatigues.\nArlo sat behind a desk that looked like\nit had survived a war. He was a man made\nof sharp angles and wire. He had a\nbuzzcut that was growing out gray and\neyes that looked like they had seen\neverything twice and weren't impressed\neither time. He was drinking coffee from\na mug that said, \"World's okayest\nlawyer.\" Norm Willis said, \"This is\nArlo. He hates everyone, but he hates\nbullies the most.\" Arlo didn't smile. He\npointed to a wooden chair. \"Sit.\" I sat.\nI didn't waste time with pleasantries. I\npulled out my laptop and the thumb\ndrive. I laid it out for him. Not the\nemotional story, the technical one. I\nhave 12 audio recordings, I said. All\ntimestamped, all original files, no\nedits, just noise reduction for clarity.\nI have chain of custody logs for each\none. I verified the one party consent\nstatute. I was physically present in the\nshared living space for every single\nrecording. I opened the folder on my\nscreen. Here are photographs of the\nguardianship petition she drafted 2\nweeks before my medical event. Here are\nthe bank transfers. And here is a file\non her grandfather, Earl Langston, who\ndied 5 years ago under similar\ncircumstances.\nArlo leaned back in his chair. The\nspring squeaked. He looked at the\nlaptop, then at me. He picked up a pen\nand tapped it against his chin. How many\nrecordings? He asked. His voice was\ngravel. 12, I said. So far, you logged\nthe location and time for each one.\nYes, including ambient noise conditions\nand my physical position in the room\nrelative to the subject.\nArlo stared at me. You have done this\nbefore.\n9 years as a forensic audio analyst for\nthe Typicanoo County Police Department,\nI said. Before that, 30 years in radio.\nArlo cracked a smile. It transformed his\nface, making him look 10 years younger.\nWell, he said softly. They picked\nthe wrong old man. He pulled a yellow\nlegal pad toward him. He started writing\nfast. Here is the situation, Norm. The\nguardianship petition she filed is a\nloaded gun, but we can jam it. The fact\nthat it is dated before your heart\nattack is gold. It proves premeditation.\nIt proves she was planning to declare\nyou incompetent before you actually had\na medical reason to be. He looked up.\nThe recordings are admissible. If you\nwere in the room, you are a party to the\nconversation. But the Langston stuff,\nthat is tricky. That is a different\njurisdiction. We can't use it as direct\nevidence of a crime against you, but we\ncan introduce it to establish a pattern\nof behavior.\nHe leaned forward, his elbows on the\nmessy desk. I will take the case. We\nwill file a counter petition. We will\nreport the financial transfers to Adult\nProtective Services, but I need you to\ndo something for me, and you are not\ngoing to like it. what I asked. I need\nyou to go back to that house, Arlo said.\nMy stomach turned over. If you leave\nnow, he continued. She wins the\nnarrative. She tells the judge you\nwandered off. She tells the judge you\nare confused and erratic. It strengthens\nher claim that you need a guardian. We\nneed you there. We need you rational,\ncalm, and present. He pointed his pen at\nme. And we need her comfortable. We need\nher feeling safe. When people feel safe,\nthey talk. I want you to go back there\nand be the sweetest, most confused old\nman in Indiana. I want you to make her\nthink she has already won. I thought\nabout the kitchen, the soup, the way she\nlooked at me like I was a piece of\nfurniture. I can do that, I said. Arlo\nnodded. Good, because the hearing is in\n3 weeks. We are going to let her walk\ninto that courtroom thinking she is\ncoming for a coronation. He stood up and\noffered me a hand. His grip was dry and\nstrong. Keep the recorder running, Norm.\nAnd for God's sake, don't eat anything\nshe prepares if you can help it. I\nwalked out of his office and into the\ncold sun. I felt lighter. I had a weapon\nnow. I had a strategy. I walked back to\nthe house that was no longer a home. I\nunlocked the door. Hey, Dad. Deanna\ncalled from the living room. You were\ngone a long time. Did you get lost? I\nwalked into the room. She was watching a\nreality show. I smiled, my vacuous\nfurniture smile. A little, I said, but I\nfound my way back. She didn't even look\naway from the screen. Good for you, Dad.\nI went to my room. I checked the battery\non the Zoom recorder. Full charge. I sat\non the edge of the bed and waited for\nnight to fall. The hunter was home. The\nfolder labeled Langston sat on Willa's\ndesk like an unexloded bomb. It was\nTuesday of week 4. I had brought the\nphotographs on my phone to the studio,\nand Willa had printed them out. Now the\npaper copies were spread across her\nmixing console covering the sliders and\nknobs. Willa typed furiously on her\nkeyboard. The blue light of the monitors\nreflected in her glasses. She was\ndigging. \"Here it is,\" she said. Her\nvoice was tight. \"Terraote Tribune\nStarbituaries archives.\" I leaned over\nher shoulder. The screen showed a scan\nnewspaper page from 5 years ago. There\nwas a grainy black and white photo of a\nman. He had a kind face, a receding\nhairline, and he was wearing a plaid\nshirt that looked a lot like the one I\nwas wearing right now.\nEarl Thomas Langston, I read aloud, 74,\npassed away unexpectedly at his home.\nUnexpectedly, Willer repeated. She\nscrolled down. Survived by his loving\ngranddaughter, Deanna Langston. No other\nimmediate family. 74 is young, Willa\nsaid. She clicked a new tab. She typed\ninto a real estate aggregator site. She\nfiltered for sold properties in Terraote\n5 years ago. She found it in 30 seconds.\nThe house was a small bungalow on\nSycamore Street. Vinyl siding, a porch\nthat needed painting. Listed for sale.\nOctober 12th, Willa said. I looked at\nthe obituary date again. August 28th.\nShe listed the house 6 weeks after he\ndied. I said Willa clicked on the\nproperty history. Sold in November. Cash\noffer. Quick close. She spun around in\nher chair to face me. The timeline\nmatches Norm. It is the exact same\nplaybook. Isolate the elderly relative.\nWait for a medical event. Take control\nof the estate. Liquidate the assets.\nMove on.\nI looked at Earl's face on the screen\nagain. He looked like a man who liked to\nfish, a man who probably sat in a\nrecliner and watched TV while his\ngranddaughter made him soup. Keep\ndigging, I said. Willow went to a\ncommunity forum, an old message board\nfor the neighborhood. She searched for\nEarl's name. She found a post from a\nwoman named Martha, a neighbor. So sad\nto hear about Earl, the post read. He\nwas such a sweet man. I tried to bring\nhim a casserole last week, but that\ngranddaughter of his wouldn't let me\npass the door. Said he was too sick for\nvisitors. He deserved better than dying\nalone with only that girl there. I felt\na cold shiver run down my spine,\nsettling in the base of my neck. Dying\nalone with only that girl there, just\nlike I had been on the kitchen floor.\nThe only difference was that I had\nreached for the pills and my heart had\ndecided to keep beating. Earl hadn't\nbeen so lucky. Or maybe Deanna had been\nmore thorough that time. \"We are not\njust dealing with a thief,\" Willis said\nsoftly. She looked at me and for the\nfirst time in 20 years, I saw genuine\nfear in her eyes. \"Norm, you cannot go\nback there.\" \"I have to,\" I said. She\ngrabbed my arm. \"She is dangerous. This\nis not a guardianship case anymore. This\nis God, Norm. This is serial behavior.\nThat is why I have to go back, I said. I\nlooked at the photo of Earl Langston one\nlast time. I memorized his face. I owed\nhim that much. If I don't stop her, I\nsaid there will be a third old man and a\nfourth.\nI gathered the papers. I put them back\nin the folder. I felt a new weight in my\nchest, but it wasn't my heart. It was\nthe weight of a ghost hitching a ride.\nI'm going home, Willa. I have a\nrecording to catch. Friday night, 9:00.\nThe house was quiet, settled into the\nheavy, drowsy rhythm of the weekend. I\nwas in my recliner in the living room.\nMy eyes were closed. My mouth was\nslightly open, mimicking the slack jawed\nsleep of the medicated. A hardcover book\nrose and fell on my chest with every\nbreath. But under the flannel collar of\nmy shirt, the red light of the lavalier\nmicrophone was covered with tape, and\nthe membrane was vibrating, capturing\nevery molecule of sound in the room.\nBrett was asleep on the sofa. He had\npassed out halfway through a sitcom\nrerun. His head was thrown back and he\nwas snoring. It was a jagged, irregular\nsound, obstructive sleep apneoa. He\nwould snore, choke, silence, and then\ngasp, snore, choke, silence, gasp. It\nwas a rhythm I could edit out later. I\nhad the frequency filters ready in my\nhead. The TV was on low. A laugh track\nbubbled up at 400 hertz canned hysteria\nfrom dead people. Deanna was in the\nkitchen because of the open floor plan.\nShe was only 14 ft away from me. I could\nsee her through the slit of my eyelids.\nShe was sitting at the island, a glass\nof wine in front of her. She was\nwatching bread. She waited. She waited\nfor his snoring to deepen, hitting the\ndelta wave rhythm that meant he was\ntruly out. Then she picked up her phone.\nShe didn't dial. She accepted an\nincoming FaceTime call. She propped the\nphone up against the fruit bowl. Hey,\"\nshe whispered. But it wasn't a quiet\nwhisper. It was the projected stage\nwhisper she used when she wanted to be\nheard, but wanted to maintain the\nillusion of secrecy. I tightened my grip\non the remote control hidden under the\nblanket. My thumb hovered over the\nvolume down button. If the TV got too\nloud, I would lower it just a notch,\njust enough to keep her voice clear. She\nwas talking to Crystal again. \"I'm\ntelling you, Chris, we are on track,\"\nDeanna said. She took a sip of wine. The\nhearing is set for 2 weeks. Brett signed\nthe supporting statement tonight. I\nheard Crystal's tiny voice from the\nphone speaker, but I couldn't make out\nthe words. Deanna laughed. He thinks it\nis to help Dad. He honestly believes we\nare doing this to manage his medication\nschedule. She glanced over at Brett. He\nlet out a long rattling snore. She\nlooked at me. I kept my breathing\nsteady. 14 breaths per minute. The\nrhythm of the deep sleeper. Scared\nDeanna asked, responding to Crystal.\nGirl of what? Look at him. She waved her\nhand in my direction. He is a deaf old\nman who talks to his dead wife's tape\nrecorder. The judge will take one look\nat him and stamp the papers. He drools\nwhen he eats soup. I didn't drool. I had\nstaged that for her benefit. It was\nworking. Crystal said something else.\nDeanna swirled her wine. No, the heart\nthing was honestly it was a gift. My\nheart hammered against the book on my\nchest. A gift. A medical event plus\ndocumented confusion equals fasttrack\nguardianship. she recited like she was\nreading from a manual. Indiana law is\nvery clear. If he cannot manage his own\nhealth, the court appoints a fiduciary.\nShe paused. She took a long drink. The\nsilence stretched. The refrigerator\nhummed. Brett snorted. Then she lowered\nher voice. The tomber changed. It\ndropped into a lower register, stripped\nof the performance, stripped of the\npretense. This was the real voice. \"Last\ntime was easy,\" she said. I stopped\nbreathing. I forced my lungs to hold the\nair. I needed absolute silence from my\nown body. Pop didn't even fight it, she\nsaid. He just faded. Pop pop. Earl\nLangston. I heard the ghost of Earl in\nthe room with us. I heard the silence of\nhis house on Sycamore Street. This one\nis a little more stubborn, Deanna said,\nlooking at me with cold, dead eyes. But\ngive it time, she swiped at her phone\nscreen. I figure 6 months after\nguardianship, we sell his house. The\nmarket is hot right now. We move the\npension into an account I control and we\nstart looking at that place in Carmel I\nshowed you. Crystal asked a question.\nYeah, Deanna answered. He can go to\nAutumn Ridge. It is cheap. They take\nMedicaid once the assets are drained.\nShe laughed again. Girl, by this time\nnext year, we will be in a four-bedroom\nin Carmel and Norm Puit will be eating\njello- in a nursing home wondering what\nhappened. Brett shifted on the couch. He\ngroaned in his sleep. Deanna's eyes\nsnapped to him. She froze. I froze.\nBrett settled back down. The snoring\nresumed. Deanna exhaled. Okay, I got to\ngo. He is stirring. Love you. Bye. She\ntapped the phone. She finished her wine\nin one gulp. She walked past me, leaving\na trail of vanilla scent in her wake.\nShe went down the hall to the master\nbedroom and closed the door. I waited 5\nminutes, 10 minutes. When I was sure she\nwasn't coming back, I opened my eyes.\nThe room was the same. The TV was still\nplaying the sitcom. Brett was still\nsnoring, but the world had tilted on its\naxis. Last time was easy. Pop Pop didn't\neven fight it. She had confessed, not to\na crime, maybe not in the way a lawyer\nwould define it yet, but she had\nconfessed to the pattern. She had\nadmitted that Earl Langston wasn't a\ntragedy. He was a practice run. I stood\nup. My legs felt solid. The trembling\nwas gone. I walked to my room. I didn't\nshuffle. I moved with the silent\nprecision of a predator. I sat at my\ndesk and plugged the recorder into the\nlaptop. I watched the file transfer. The\nblue bar crawled across the screen. I\nopened the waveform. I put on my studio\nmonitors, the big headphones that\nblocked out the world. I isolated the\ntrack. I applied a highpass filter to\ncut the rumble of the furnace. I applied\na noise gate to snap silence between her\nwords. I used a parametric equalizer to\ndip the frequency of the TV laugh track.\nHer voice emerged from the noise, naked,\nsharp. Last time was easy. I played it\nagain. Pop didn't even fight it. I\nlooked at the file name. I sat back in\nmy chair. The darkness of the garage\nseemed to press in on me, but I didn't\nfeel small anymore. For 4 weeks, I had\nbeen operating on defense. I was trying\nto save my house. I was trying to save\nmy pension. I was trying to prove I\nwasn't incompetent. That was over. This\nwasn't about guardianship anymore. This\nwas a homicide investigation in reverse.\nShe had killed Earl Langston. Maybe not\nwith a gun. Maybe not with poison, but\nwith neglect and isolation and a stolen\nwill. And she was in the middle of doing\nthe exact same thing to me. I wasn't the\nvictim. I was the undercover wire. I\nlooked at the boxes of equipment in the\ncorner, the tools of my trade. I had\nspent 40 years cleaning up audio, making\nvoices sound better than they were. Now,\nI was going to do the opposite. I was\ngoing to make sure everyone heard\nexactly who she was. I clicked save. I\nbacked the file up to the thumb drive. I\nbacked it up to the cloud. Then I went\nto sleep. And for the first time since\nthe heart attack, I slept without\ndreaming. I had work to do in the\nmorning. The official declaration of war\narrived on a Monday. It came in a manila\nenvelope delivered by a bored looking\nprocess server who smelled of cigarette\nsmoke. I signed for it on the front\nporch. The wind whipped the bare\nbranches of the oak tree in the yard a\nsound like rattling bones. Brett was\nhome. Deanna had made sure of that. She\nwas coincidentally working late. Brett\nstood in the doorway, his hands shoved\ndeep into his pockets. He handed me the\npapers after the server left. His own\nhands were shaking. Dad Deanna says this\nis this is just to protect you, he said,\nnot meeting my eyes. For your finances\nand stuff, she says it is standard\nprocedure. I took the envelope from him.\nThe paper was thick, important. I didn't\nneed to open it. I knew what it was. I\nwalked past him and went to my room. I\nsat on the edge of the bed and read\nevery word. The legal language was cold,\nprecise, and full of lies. Respondent\ndemonstrates diminished capacity. Unable\nto manage his own health and financial\naffairs, petitioner has provided\nconsistent and loving care. They had set\nthe hearing for 3 weeks from today. I\npicked up my phone and called Arlo. My\nvoice was calm when I spoke. The furnace\nof my anger was burning too hot to\nproduce smoke. They filed, I said,\nhearing as in 3 weeks. Good. Arlo's\nvoice came back a low rumble. Let her\nthink she is winning. We file our\nresponse on the deadline not a day\nbefore. We give her no time to prepare\nfor what is coming. I hung up. I folded\nthe papers and placed them on my\nnightstand. The first shot had been\nfired. Now it was my turn to listen for\nthe echo. Deanna's victory lap lasted\nall week. She floated through the house\nhumming. She was relaxed, expansive,\ndrunk on the belief that she had already\nwon. Her confidence made her careless.\nWednesday night, she made her first\nmistake. She came home from work,\ndropped her purse on the kitchen island,\nand went to take a shower. The purse,\nthe big over stuffed leather one she\ncarried everywhere was a Czechov's gun.\nI'd been watching for weeks. It landed\nwith a heavy thud and it fell open. I\nwas sitting at the kitchen table,\nnursing a cup of tea. From my chair in\nthe shared open space of the kitchen and\ndining area, I had a clear line of sight\ninto the bag. I didn't move. I didn't\ntouch it. I just looked. There was the\nusual clutter, a wallet keys, a\nhalf-eaten protein bar. But on top, I\nsaw it. The corner of a manila folder\nwith the words puit legal written on the\ntab. Sticking out of that folder was the\ncorner of my own social security card.\nShe was carrying my identity in her\npurse like a trophy. And next to the\nfolder, a business card. The logo was a\nstylized comforting tree. Autumn Ridge\nSenior Living. Schedule your tour today.\nShe was already shopping for my cage. I\nheard the water in the master bathroom\nshut off. I looked down into my teacup.\nI focused on the steam rising in lazy\ncurls. I did not move. A few minutes\nlater, she walked back into the kitchen,\na towel wrapped around her wet hair. The\nair filled with the scent of her shampoo\nand that everpresent vanilla body spray.\n\"Oh,\" she said, seeing the open purse.\n\"I just threw this down. Sorry, Dad.\nJust some work stuff.\" She grabbed the\nbag and zipped it shut. The sound of the\nzipper teeth grinding together was harsh\nvinyl. \"No problem, sweetheart,\" I said.\nShe smiled at me. The practiced 440\nhertz smile that was all teeth and no\nwarmth. \"Diana,\" I said. She turned her\nhand on the purse strap. \"You have a\ngood heart,\" I said. The words landed. I\nwatched them hit her. She blinked. For a\ntenth of a second, something flickered\nacross her face. It wasn't guilt. It was\nsurprise. the pure animal surprise of a\npredator being called gentle by its\nprey. She recovered instantly. The smile\nsnapped back into place. \"Honestly,\" she\nsaid. \"I just want what is best for this\nfamily.\" \"There it was, number 24. I'd\nbeen counting.\" The close call happened\nthe next day, Thursday afternoon. Deanna\ncame home early. I was sitting at the\nkitchen table, methodically cleaning my\nhearing aids with a small brush. My\nlaptop was in my room on my desk. It was\nopen. The audio editing software was on\nthe screen showing a neat row of labeled\nrecordings. Deanna walked past me\ncarrying a basket of clean laundry.\n\"Just bringing you your shirts, Dad,\"\nshe said. But she didn't just drop the\nbasket. I heard her footsteps continue\ninto my room. A moment later, I heard\nthe distinctive low-frequency creek of\nthe third floorboard inside the doorway.\nIt was a sound I had cataloged. It was\nthe sound of someone snooping, not just\npassing through. I put down the cleaning\nbrush. I stood up slowly, making a small\ngroan as I straightened my back. I\nshuffled down the hallway. I found her\nstanding in the middle of my room. The\nlaundry basket was in her hands, but her\neyes were sweeping the space, taking\ninventory. Her gaze lingered on the\nstack of old equipment boxes in the\ncorner.\n\"Just bringing your shirts, Dad,\" she\nsaid again. \"Thank you,\" I said. I\nlooked past her at my desk, at the\nlaptop. The screen was dark. A small box\nin the center of the screen read, \"Enter\npassword.\" It had autolocked. I had set\nthe timeout to 60 seconds, a habit I had\npicked up from my years with the police\ndepartment. You never leave a screen\nopen ever.\nDeanna's eyes drifted to the laptop,\nthen back to the boxes. You know, she\nsaid we should really clear some of this\nold radio stuff out. We could donate it.\nGoodwill would take it. I stood very\nstill. I looked at the boxes filled with\nthe tools of my salvation. I like having\nit around, I said. My voice was even.\nReminds me of Dela. She used to visit me\nat the station. I'd never used Dela's\nname as a shield before. It felt like a\nviolation, but it worked. Deanna's face\ntightened with annoyance, a micro\nexpression that was gone as quickly as\nit appeared. She forced another smile.\nSure, Dad. Whatever makes you happy. She\nput the laundry on my bed and walked\nout. I listened to her footsteps fade\ndown the hall. I let out a breath I\ndidn't realize I'd been holding. My\nheart was hammering against my ribs. One\nminute. If she had come home one minute\nearlier, she would have seen it all. The\nfiles, the waveforms, the name Earl\nLangston. That night, I added a second\npassword to the laptop. Then a third.\nFrom then on, whenever I wasn't using\nit, I kept it tucked under my mattress,\ncold and hard against the springs. The\nhouse was no longer a recording studio.\nIt was a war zone. Saturday night, week\nfive. All is lost. I was on the sofa in\nthe living room. The TV was on a nature\ndocumentary about lions. I wasn't\nwatching it. The recorder was running in\nmy pocket. The microphone was live. My\nbody was in the living room, but my ears\nwere in the kitchen. Deanna and Brett\nwere at the kitchen table. The overhead\nlight cast a harsh clinical glare on\nthem. It looked like an operating\ntheater. In a way, it was. They were\nperforming a dissection of my life.\nDeanna had a yellow legal pad in front\nof her. She was coaching him. Her voice\nwas rhythmic, repetitive, like a\nmetronome drilling a pattern into his\nbrain. Say it again, she commanded. From\nthe top. Brett's voice was a monotone.\nHe was reciting, not speaking. My father\nhas shown signs of confusion for the\npast several months. He forgets to take\nhis medication. He talks to recordings\nof my mother. He wanders the house at\nodd hours.\nNight? Deanna interrupted. Say at night,\nit sounds worse. wanders the house at\nnight. Red corrected himself. I'm\nconcerned about his ability to manage\nhis own affairs. Deanna's pen tapped the\npad. Tap tap tap. Good. Now, the part\nabout the heart attack. Brett hesitated,\nhis hands resting on the table began\ntheir nervous dance fingers twisting\nover each other. My father's heart\nattack was was a result of his own\nnegligence in managing his medication.\nAdd the word sadly, Deanna instructed\nher voice soft instructive. Judges love\nsad sons. My father's heart attack was\nsadly a result of his own negligence,\nBrett repeated. The word sounded foreign\nin his mouth. Perfect. Deanna purred. D.\nAre we sure about this? Brett asked. His\nvoice was small. A flicker of the boy, I\nremembered. Deanna's head snapped up.\nHer voice turned sharp as broken glass.\nAre we sure, Brett? Your father nearly\ndied because he cannot take care of\nhimself. What do you think happens next\ntime? Do you want to be the one to find\nhim? I just he seems fine to me\nsometimes, Brett mumbled. Deanna's tone\nshifted again. It became a soft warm\nsyrup of manipulation. Baby, she said,\nreaching across the table to cover his\nhand with hers. That is the disease.\nThat is what is so cruel about it. Lucid\nmoments do not mean he is lucid. It\nmeans he is having a good hour. Trust\nme, this is what is best for him. This\nis the only way to keep him safe.\nBrett's hand stopped ringing under hers.\nHe nodded. \"Okay,\" he said from the top,\nDeanna said, pulling her hand back. I\nsat on the sofa. I listened to my son,\nmy only child. I listened to him\nrehearse the lies that would strip me of\nmy home, my autonomy, my name. The same\nvoice that once shouted, \"Dad, I can\nhear the whole world was now being tuned\nand sculpted to destroy mine.\" I had\nexpected Deanna's cruelty. She was a\npredator. Predators hunt. It is what\nthey do. But this sound, the sound of my\nson's surrender, the flat obedience in\nhis voice as he said, \"Okay,\" was a\nfrequency of grief I had never known. He\nwasn't evil. He was captured. He was a\nsignal buried so deep in noise that he\nno longer remembered his own sound. And\nin 2 weeks, he was going to walk into a\ncourtroom and perform a script written\nby his captor. And he was going to\nbelieve he was helping me. The question\nwas no longer whether I could win. I had\nthe evidence. I had the recordings. I\nknew I could win. The real question was\nwhat would be left of my son when I did.\nLater that night, I drove to a gas\nstation on the edge of town. I stood by\nthe air pump under the buzzing\nfluorescent lights and called Arlo. She\nis coaching him, I said. I have the\nrecording. That is good evidence. Norm\nMarlo said. That is dynamite. That is my\nson, Arlo.\nThere was a long silence on the line. I\ncould hear the wind whistling past the\nphone. I know. Arlo said finally. His\nvoice was heavy. That is why we have to\nwin. Sleep was a country I could no\nlonger visit. I sat on the edge of my\nbed in the 2 a.m. darkness of the\ngarage. The house was a dead frequency\nzone. The only sound, the low 120 hertz\nhum of the furnace kicking on in the\nbasement. I had no equipment on, no\nheadphones, no recorder running. There\nwas nothing left to capture but the\nstatic inside my own head. I kept\nplaying the last recording, not Deanna's\nvoice. I was immune to that now. It was\nBrett's the flat rehearsed monotone as\nhe recited the word she had fed him. The\nsound of his surrender. The way he said\nokay when she told him this was for the\nbest. That was the sound that was\nbreaking me. For 5 weeks I had been the\nhero of my own story. The quiet man\nfighting back. The sound engineer\nbuilding a case. But what if I was just\nanother kind of liar? I had been\nrecording my family in secret. I had\nbeen performing the role of a confused\nold man. I was manipulating perception\njust like she was. Only my tools were\nmicrophones and equalizers instead of\nfake concern and gaslighting. I was\nbuilding a weapon to destroy my son's\nlife to save my own. Even if I won, what\nwould Brett become? The man who finds\nout his wife is a predator who tried to\nkill his father. The son who sat in a\ncourtroom and testified against that\nsame father only to be proven a fool.\nEither way, he was destroyed. The\nfoundation of his life would turn to\ndust. Maybe the best thing to do was to\njust let it go. I could pack a bag. I\ncould walk out the door before the sun\ncame up. I could find a small apartment\non the other side of town. Let Deanna\nhave the house. Let her have the money.\nIt was just paper. It was just wood and\nnails. In time, maybe Brett and I could\nfind our way back to each other. Maybe\nif I sacrificed everything, I could\nsalvage that one last thing. I picked up\nmy phone. The screen cast a cold blue\nlight on my hands. I looked at Arlo's\nnumber. I could call him, tell him to\ndrop the counter petition. I could tell\nhim I was done. My thumb hovered over\nthe call button. I couldn't do it. I\nswiped over to my photos instead. I\nfound the picture that lived on the\nrefrigerator door. Brett, age 8, sitting\non my lap in the main studio at WLFI. He\nwas wearing my huge headphones, his eyes\nwide with wonder, a gap to smile on his\nface. The memory was so clear, I could\nsmell the ozone from the tape machines.\nDela, I whispered into the darkness.\nWhat would you do? You always heard me\neven when I wasn't speaking. I need to\nhear you now. The silence that answered\nwas absolute. It was the loneliest\nfrequency of all. My hand moved on its\nown. It reached for the old Sony\ncassette player on my nightstand. I\npicked it up. The plastic was cool,\nworn, smooth from years of use. It felt\nlike a part of my own body. I pressed\nthe eject button. The door opened with a\nsoft mechanical sigh. I took out the\ntape. Dela's tape, the one I hadn't\nlistened to since the heart attack. I\nhad been afraid to. I was afraid that\nhearing her voice so full of life would\nshatter the cold professional shell I\nhad built around myself. But it was 2:30\nin the morning, and the shell was\nalready cracking. I put the tape back in\nand pressed play. The familiar click and\nwor of the mechanism was a sound from\nanother lifetime. Then the hiss of\nmagnetic particles rushing past a\nplayhead. Her voice filled the small\nroom singing that old Roy Orbison song.\nBlue Bayou slightly off key, full of\nsunlight and pancake batter. The\nrecording was full of life, the clatter\nof a fork, the hiss of the gas stove,\nthe shuffle of her slippers on the\nlenolium floor. It was the sound of a\nwoman who didn't know she was being\npreserved for a future she would never\nsee.\nMy chest achd with a grief so sharp it\nfelt like the heart attack was starting\nall over again. The song finished. There\nwere 10 seconds of silence. Then the\nsound of her humming something else too\nquiet to identify. And then another\nvoice. Brett. He was 22 home from\ncollege for the weekend. His voice was\nhigher than clearer, not yet thickened\nwith the compromises of adult life. Mom,\nyou sound so happy. He said on the tape.\nDela laughed. a sound like windchimes.\n\"I am happy, baby,\" she answered. \"Your\nfather gave me the best gift this\nmorning.\" \"What was that?\" Brett asked.\nDela's recorded voice spoke the words\nthat changed everything. He listened to\nme. \"Really listened? Do you know how\nrare that is?\" \"A man who actually hears\nyou?\" The tape hissed for a few more\nseconds and then the recording ended. I\nsat in the dark. The words echoed in the\nsilence of the garage. \"A man who\nactually hears you.\" That was what she\nvalued. Not my paycheck from the\nstation, not the promotions I never got.\nShe valued the one thing I knew how to\ndo better than anyone else. I knew how\nto listen. And in that moment, sitting\nin a cold garage with a laptop full of\nlies and a broken heart. I finally\nunderstood what I had to do. This wasn't\nabout destroying Deanna. This wasn't\nabout revenge. This was about making\nBrett here. Not my words, not my\naccusations. I had to make him hear the\ntruth in the one voice he might still\nbelieve hers. I wasn't a lawyer. I\nwasn't a fighter. I was a sound\nengineer. My entire life, my one job had\nbeen to take a messy, noisy, complicated\nsignal and make it clean. To make the\nimportant voices clear so the audience\ncould hear what mattered. I had one more\nshow to produce. I sat up straight. I\nwiped my face on the sleeve of my shirt.\nI turned on my laptop. The screen\nglowed. I opened the audio files, all 23\nof them. I started dragging them into\nthe editing software, lining them up on\nthe timeline. I wasn't just collecting\nevidence anymore. I was building a\nnarrative. I was crafting a broadcast.\nThis one wasn't for the radio. This one\nwas for an audience of one. A son who\nneeded to hear his wife's real voice for\nthe first time. And a judge who was\ngoing to be sitting in the front row. At\n6:00 in the morning, as the first gray\nlight began to filter through the garage\nwindow, I called Willa. \"I need your\nstudio,\" I said. \"Today all day,\" her\nvoice was thick with sleep, but she\ndidn't hesitate. \"What are we building?\"\n\"A broadcast,\" I said. \"The last one of\nmy career.\" \"I will make the coffee,\"\nshe said and hung up. For the next week,\nWilla's studio became my entire world.\nWe worked in long, silent shifts fueled\nby black coffee and a shared unspoken\nrage. I sat at the mixing console, my\nhands moving over the sliders and knobs\nwith an intimacy born of 40 years of\npractice. This was my craft. This was my\nchurch. I took Deanna's voice and I put\nit under a microscope. I surgically\nremoved the sound of Brett snoring. I\nused a DSER to soften the harsh\nsibilance of her lies. I used a noise\ngate to create stark dramatic silences\nbetween her sentences. I took every\nrecording where she said the word\nhonestly and edited them together into a\nbrutal percussive super cut. Honestly,\nhonestly, honestly. Each one a hammer\nblow. Willow worked on the visuals. She\ntook my phone pictures and cleaned them\nup. She blew up the image of the\nguardianship petition, highlighting the\ndate in red. She found a clear, smiling\nphoto of Earl Langston from an old\nchurch directory and placed it side by\nside with his obituary. Arlo came by on\nthe final day. He watched the full\n12-minute presentation on the studio\nmonitor without a word. When it was\nover, he just nodded. \"That will do,\" he\nsaid. We rendered the final file, a\nsingle video file on a thumb drive, 12\nminutes long, the length of a radio news\nsegment. It was the story of a man being\nerased. And it was told entirely in the\nvoice of the woman holding the eraser.\nThe work was done. The broadcast was\nready. All that was left was to find a\nstage. The morning of the hearing, I\nwoke up on Will's sofa. The apartment\nsmelled of coffee and newsprint. For a\nmoment, I didn't know where I was. Then\nthe weight of the day settled on me, a\nphysical pressure in my chest. Willa had\nmade breakfast eggs and toast, but I\ncouldn't eat. The food sat on the plate\nlike a prop. I drank the coffee black\nand bitter. I stood in front of the\nmirror in her small bathroom and\nstraightened the knot of my tie. I was\nwearing the suit Dela had bought me for\nour 40th anniversary, dark navy wool. I\nhad only worn it once to her funeral.\nThe faint scent of mothballs clung to\nthe fabric, a smell like preserved time.\nI took the hearing aids from their case.\nI picked them up. The small plastic\nshells cool against my fingertips. I\nsettled them in my ears. A familiar\nroutine. The world snapped into focus.\nThe hiss of the radiator, the distant\ngroan of a garbage truck. Then, with a\nslow, deliberate press of my thumb, I\nturned them both off. I didn't need\namplification today. Today, the world\nwas going to hear me. Will drove. The\ncar was quiet as we crossed the Wobbash\nRiver. The water a sheet of dull gray\nsteel under the February sky. \"You\nready, Norm?\" she asked, not taking her\neyes off the road. \"40 years of sound\nchecks,\" I said. \"One more.\" She glanced\nat me, a quick fierce look. Dela would\nbe so proud. I looked out the window at\nthe flat frozen fields of Indiana. She\nwould be furious, I said, then proud in\nthat order. The courtroom was exactly as\nI remembered it from my flash forward.\nIt was the same stage, but the actors\nwere different now. I was different. The\nfluorescent lights still hummed at 60\nhertz. Deanna still wore the navy\nblazer, the tag still tucked inside the\ncollar. Brett still sat beside her in\nhis Ford polo shirt. Deanna's lawyer\nwent first. He painted a picture of a\nloving daughter-in-law burdened by a\nconfused, declining father. He used\nwords like erratic and incapable. He\nspoke of my self- neglect that led to\nthe heart attack. Then he called his\nonly witness, Brett Puit. My son made\nthe slow walk to the witness box. He\nmoved like a man walking through deep\nwater. His hand, when he placed it on\nthe Bible, was trembling. He sat down.\nHe put his hands in his pockets, hiding\nthem from view. He began to speak. The\nwords came out flat, hollow, devoid of\nany frequency that sounded like my son.\nHe was a playback machine reciting a\ncorrupted file. My father has shown\nsigns of confusion for the past several\nmonths. He set his eyes fixed on a point\non the far wall. He wanders the house at\nnight. He recited the lies she had\nwritten for him. Word for word, he told\nthe court that I forgot my medication.\nHe told them I talked to recordings of\nmy dead wife. And then he delivered the\nfinal polished line. His heart attack\nwas sadly a result of his own\nnegligence. I watched him. I did not\nflinch. I didn't look away. I just\nlistened to sound engineer monitoring a\nbroken signal. Arlo stood up. His\ncross-examination was short, quiet. A\nsurgeon making a single precise\nincision.\nMr. Puit, he asked, \"Who wrote those\nwords you just said?\" Brett blinked. I\nWhat those specific words? Arlo\nrepeated. sadly a result of his own\nnegligence. \"Who composed that\nsentence?\" Brett's eyes flickered toward\nDeanna. Her expression was a mask of\nstone. \"They are,\" my words, Brett said.\n\"I see.\" Arlo said. \"We will revisit\nthat. No further questions.\" Arlo turned\nto the judge. \"Your honor, at this time\nwe would like to present our evidence.\nIt is an audiovisisual compilation 12\nminutes in length.\" Judge Frick nodded\nto the baiff. The large screen at the\nfront of the courtroom flickered to\nlife. The first thing the court heard\nwas not my voice. It was Deanna's\ncrystal clear captured in high fidelity\nfrom 12 feet away in an open plan\nkitchen. Once I am his legal guardian, I\ncontrol everything. The pension, the\nsocial security, the house. Deanna's\nface went rigid. She whispered something\nto her lawyer who shook his head\nhelpless. The second audio clip played.\nBrett does not fight anything. That is\nwhy I married him. I watched my son. He\nturned his head slowly and looked at his\nwife. His hands, which had been hidden\nin his pockets, came out. They were not\nringing. They lay flat on his thighs as\nstill as stones. Then came the third\nrecording, the coaching session. The\ncourt heard Deanna's voice, first sharp\nand instructive. Add the word sadly.\nJudges love sad sons. And then they\nheard Brett's voice repeating the exact\nwords he had just testified to under\noath. My father's heart attack was sadly\na result of his own negligence. A ripple\nof sound went through the courtroom. A\ncollective intake of breath. Judge Frick\ntook off her reading glasses. She placed\nthem on the bench with a quiet,\ndeliberate click. Deanna's lawyer stood\nup. Your honor, this is an invasion of\nprivacy.\nThe evidence was admitted, the judge\nsaid without looking at him. Let it\nplay. And then came the final clip, the\none I had saved for last. Deanna's voice\nlow and conspiratorial from a late\nFriday night. Last time was easy. Pop\npop pop didn't even fight it. On the\nscreen, the smiling face of Earl\nLangston appeared, followed by his\nobituary, the date of death, the letter\nfrom the lawyer about the sale of his\nhouse. The video ended. The screen went\nblack for five full seconds. The only\nsound in the room was the 60 Hz hum of\nthe lights. Deanna shot to her feet. Her\nlawyer tried to pull her back down, but\nshe shook him off. That is taken out of\ncontext, she shouted, her voice shrill,\nthe frequency spiking into the red. He\nwas spying on me. He recorded me in my\nown home, your honor, Arlo said calmly.\nMr. Puit is a resident of the household.\nHe was physically present in the same\nshared living space during every\nrecording. Indiana code 35-33.5-5-5\none party consent. Every recording was\nlegally obtained. He is crazy, Deanna\nscreamed. He is a crazy old man who Mrs.\nPuit Judge Frick's voice cut through the\nair like a blade. Sit down. Deanna\ndidn't sit. She spun around and faced\nBrett, her face contorted. Her final\ndesperate instinct was to attack. Brett,\ntell them. Tell them your father is\nconfused. Tell them I was just trying to\nhelp. Tell them. Brett looked at her. He\nlooked at her as if he was seeing her\nfor the first time. The noise, the\nstatic, the years of her overwhelming\nsignal finally fell away.\nYou said gasp loser, he said. His voice\nwas quiet, but it filled the courtroom.\nThe silence that followed was a\ndifferent kind of silence than I had\never recorded. It wasn't the absence of\nsound. It was the presence of truth. On\nthe kitchen floor, Brett continued his\nvoice breaking. My father was dying. And\nyou said, \"Gasp, loser, and I I didn't.\"\nHe covered his face with his hands. I\ndid not do anything. That was the sound,\nthe signal I had been listening for all\nalong. My son's voice breaking through\nthe noise. It was still there after all\nthis time. It was still there. Judge\nFrick's ruling was swift. The petition\nfor guardianship was denied with\nprejudice. The matter of financial\nexploitation was referred to adult\nprotective services for immediate\ninvestigation. And Deanna's statements\nregarding Earl Langston were referred to\nthe VO County Prosecutor's Office for\nreview. It was over. The courtroom\nemptied out the shuffling footsteps\nechoing on the marble floors. Deanna was\ngone. Her lawyer had hustled her out a\nside door. Her heels had clicked fast on\nthe marble, a retreating frequency, the\namplitude diminishing with every step.\nArlo shook my hand. I will handle the\nAPS filing and coordinate with VGO\nCounty. You go home, Norm. You're home.\nIt always was. Willow was standing\nbehind me. She put a hand on my\nshoulder, a steady, warm pressure. I\nlooked across the empty courtroom. Brett\nwas still there. He was standing alone\nin the aisle, 30 ft of polished marble\nbetween a father and his son. He hadn't\nmoved. I walked toward him. I walked\nslowly, not because my heart was weak,\nbut because some distances must be\ncrossed with care. I stopped 5 ft away.\nI could hear his breathing. It was\nragged. 22 breaths per minute. Panic\nrate. Dad, he whispered. I I did not\nknow. I know. I said she told me you\nwere. She said I know what she said. On\nthe floor, he choked out the words. You\nwere on the floor and I just His voice\nfragmented, breaking into frequencies of\ngrief I had never cataloged because they\nwere too close to my own. How do you\neven look at me? I took one more step. I\nwas close enough now to see the shame in\nhis eyes. Because I have spent 67 years\nlistening, I said, and right now I'm\nhearing my son for the first time in 2\nyears. He broke then, not a loud\ndramatic collapse. It was a quiet\nfolding inward, his shoulders slumping,\nhis head dropping. The sound he made was\nraw, the sound of a foundation crumbling\nfrom the inside. I reached out and put\nmy hand on his head, my fingers in his\nhair, the way I used to when he was a\nboy, and afraid of thunderstorms. I just\nheld him. It was not forgiveness. Not\nyet. Forgiveness is a frequency that\ntakes time to tune, but it was presence.\nThe presence of a father who hears his\nson even when the son has nothing left\nto say. Later on the courthouse steps,\nthe February air felt clean on my face.\nThere was no vanilla in it. No body\nspray, just the smell of Indiana winter.\nWill's car was waiting at the curb.\nBrett walked to his own car alone. He\nwould go home to an empty house. The\nrealignment of our lives had already\nbegun. I stood on the top step and\nlooked out over Lafayette. In the\ndistance, I could see the red blinking\nlight of the WLFY radio tower. my old\nstation, still broadcasting, still\nsending signals out into the air,\nwaiting for someone to listen. I reached\ninto my coat pocket. I pulled out the\nhearing aids. I held them in the palm of\nmy hand, the small plastic shells\nlooking insignificant against the lines\nof my skin. I looked at them for a long\nmoment. Then I closed my hand around\nthem and slipped them back into my\npocket, not into my ears. The air was\ncold. The morning was quiet, and for the\nfirst time in a very long time, I didn't\nneed any amplification to hear the world\nclearly. Norm's story reminds us of a\npowerful truth. In every family, there\nare frequencies we learn to tune out the\nquiet person in the corner, the sigh\nthat says more than words ever could. We\ntreat them like background noise,\nforgetting that the quietest people are\noften the most observant. The most\ndangerous truths are not shouted. They\nare whispered when someone is sure you\ncannot hear. It makes you wonder who is\nthe quietest person in your family and\nwhat truths do you think they have\nsilently collected over the years. Have\nyou ever had that chilling moment when\nyou caught the truth in a casual remark\nbecause someone underestimated what you\ncould hear? Tell us your story. Because\nas Norm proved, sometimes the greatest\npower isn't in speaking but in finally\nmaking others listen.",

(And the statute of limitations have run their course). \n\n____________Paste from Vimeo______________\n\nJohn found a J3 he wanted to buy. I'm not sure how but he found it. He has a knack for it. It was about 25 miles from Colorado Springs and belonged to a woman named Donetta. Donetta's real story can not be done justice here. Only she can tell that story.\nThe plane was her loving late husband Gary's yellow Cub. He used to woo her with it back in the seventies, buzzing low and professing his love to her over the sound of the 65 horse Continental engine. He was taken from her before his time should have been up, and with a vengeance she was going to see to it that his Cub which had not been flown since the mid eighties was restored. It was not an easy journey for Donetta or for the plane. It was finally sort of completed and granted airworthiness recently and flown 10 miles to her house where she mowed that sparse, western \"grass\" on the hill behind the unique home she and her late husband built.\nJohn, Bushy and I drove from Ohio to Colorado to pick up the plane. We made it there at 9PM --about 30 hours after we began the journey. She greeted us with the best chicken noodle soup I've had and an impressive stack of log books from the antique plane. She furnished us with grand personal stories and the weather report, which seemed rather grim--in a windy way.\nWe admired the plane with some flash lights and slept like babies (except for Bushy who slept more like a DJ--making record scratching sounds all night with his sleeping bag and air mattress. He would later refine his DJ sound-scapes with more organic sounds when he became infested with a cold on the way back).\nThe only thing that can beat Donetta's soup is her 5 course breakfast. While she made that we went over the plane and questioned the last mechanic's license. We were about to fly across the country in a craft with a couple missing cotter pins on attach points of the wing. hmmmmmmm. There's nothing quite like a thorough pre-flight.\nWe made a couple quick mods here and there and accepted the latest signatures as fact, because, let's face it, signatures make airplanes fly.\nThe adventure ahead and the emotional goodbye for Donetta was a strange concoction. It seemed like a scattered dream but I will remember it forever (especially since there was a camera--thanks camera, i love you).\nJohn Graham taxied that little plane up the hill and used almost all of the runway against the wind's wishes.\nThe rest of the adventure is left to the imagination.",

I've\ncollected six of the lead tires from TIR\ntest around the world and two new tires\nI've never tested before tire from\nfalcon and a tire from prey so it should\ngive us an overview of which is

good\ntrip but significantly behind the rest\nnow the Primacy 4 is an older Tire it's\nthe Primacy 4 plus um I'm sure there's a\nnew one due anytime now like the Pilot\nSport forest and I'm absolutely positive\nMichelin will take a significant step\nforward in the wet uh the Michelin did\nfeel classic Michelin in that it was\nvery safe very very planted a nice\nsteering tire it was just a little bit\ndown on grip and that caused under steer\nand that caused a lack of lap time now\nfrom here on up everything was was\nreally really close the Firestone in\nfifth was less than 3% behind the very\nbest and over such a Long Lap that is\nmighty impressive the Firestone had good\nlevels of grip and while it didn't feel\nremarkable in any way it didn't feel\nnegative in any way it was the most tire\ntire of all the tires and that is in no\nway a bad thing it was stable it was\ngood to drive on they've done a good job\nespecially as this Firestone is\ncategorized as a mid-range Tire next up\nwas the Continental Premium Contact 7 in\nfourth now this is a fraction off the\nbest like I said it's a very very close\ngroup but this was a slightly different\nexperience I've had before now the\nPremium Contact 7 is winning pretty much\nevery test it's been in and it might\nstill win this this is only one category\nof test in a test with lots and lots of\ncategories but it wasn't the very\ngrippiest and the Premium Contact range\nhas always been my hero amongst the\ntouring tires in that it was the one\nthat felt a little bit sporty but in\nthis size on this vehicle it didn't it\nhad a slightly sluggish steering\nreaction under steer and the rear just\nsat down a little bit after the front\nnot as bad as the Budget Tire but it was\nnoticeable so in this size at least\nthey're are sportier 17in tires although\nthis isn't a sports test so I'm guessing\nthis is going to repay back in comfort\nand the tire is going to be very good in\nComfort I will find out uh so that might\nbe the the trade-off Continental have\nmade maybe they've made it more\nappropriate for the class of tires\ntrying to be that's a lot of words next\nup was prelly and redin essentially tied\non time the pry subjectively was one of\nthe nicest all around on the vehicle\nwith lovely steering well balanced on\nall the lane changes everything happened\nas you would expect\nhomogenously again I'm not sure if\nthat's a word but it just it was\npredictable and it it felt like prel\nspent a lot of time making sure the tire\nwas balanced and it had good grip the\nred Stein was the tiniest amount ahead\nin terms of lap time but it just felt I\nguess a little bit more like the\nMichelin and the Firestone and that it\nwas very planted stable but not\nparticularly exciting and finally the\nnew fulcon it was the fastest Tire\naround the lap on average but like I\nsaid the top three tires are essentially\nthe margin for error they're all so\nclose you're not really differentiating\nmuch in that time I hope wet braking\nbreaks things up but a fulcon like the\nFred Stein was just a little bit dull a\nlittle bit a nerd you weren't really\nenjoying your experiences from a fun\npoint of view but at no point were you\never surprised or felt unsafe because\nthe grip levels were high and everything\nwas predictable so excellent job Falcon\nexcellent job pelli red Stein\ncontinental and even Firestone you've\nall done an amazing job in wet handling\nso let's look up wet breaking the\nContinental was back where you would\nexpect to see it leading the wet\nbreaking test with the new pry close\nbehind once again Falcon and vedin were\nwere impressive and the Aging Michelin a\nlittle off the front group Continental\nalso LED straight aquaplaning with the\nprey best in curve and the Michelin put\nin a better result in deeper water than\nshallow dry handling as always for dry\nwe have not just focused on lap time\nbecause lap time might not be the most\nrelevant thing for these tires in this\nkind of car but what we have done is\nspent a lot of time looking at\nsubjective reactions how the car steers\nhow it's balanced whether it's\npredictable everything you need to know\nabout the tires your everyday driving\nrounded into one\nscore now things are getting very very\nclose which is making my job a little\nbit more difficult but luckily the\nBudget Tire wasn't that close it was\npretty bouncy pretty elastic pretty over\nsteering around the lap pretty imprecise\nwhen not on the lap we're just doing\nsteering reactions and Lane gauges the\nquick reactions you get the front toning\nthen the rear would want to come around\nand it was just not wonderful you'd be\nParan annoyed when driving you'd feel\nexhausted all of the time next up was\nthe VIN this had very light steering and\nit steering sadly did feel imprecisely a\nlot better than the budget ey a lot\nfurther ahead it just felt the rear took\na little bit of time to stabilize\ncompared to the best it felt like a very\nsoft constructed Tire which I have since\nconfirmed is pretty soft conversely the\nfire stone which was around the same\ntire might have been slightly quicker\nthe fire stone felt absolutely lovely\nsublimit I liked how it steered and\nturned it's a more solid constructed\ntime maybe it's not so good in Comfort\nbut uh the fire stone the creek got\nsaturated pretty quickly which meant uh\nit was a little bit peaky at limit so\nyou to get a little bit of maybe I would\nsay surprise but quicker than you'd want\nover ster and that's uh fun around the\nlap but FS not ideal the new Falcon felt\nvery good both sublimit and on the lap\nfelt a little bit more sporty than the\nothers so far I enjoyed driving around\nand the sublimit it felt very mature and\ngrown up so good job Falcon it seems to\nbe quite an impressive step forward in\nevery condition for this new time I'm\nsurprised and impressed the top three\nTIR is there who we used to seeing at\nthe top it was Continental pry and mlim\nnow the coni did feel the most sporty of\nthe three but also felt a little bit\nelastic on steering response it turned\nquickly but then just took a little bit\nof time to settle but buckets of brip\nfor the Continental then there were the\nmiss and the prly now both these tires I\nmark them exactly the same subjectively\nbecause subit they were lovely the\nMichelin is quite an old Tire now but\nit's still just one of the most\npredictable and rounded tires and the\npry the new pry seems to have matched\nthat which made it very difficult for me\nto pick a favorite for everyday driving\nbut luckily we also did that time and as\nthe pry was the faster of the two tires\nthen the prelly wins by default so\nluckily we did the lap time all in all\nlike I said a very close field you'll be\nhappy with pretty much any of the top\nfour or five so good job everyone there\nwith throw breaking one of the easier\ntasks for tires it was naturally\ninsanely close with the prelly and\nfulcon swapping places at the top but\nthe top four were so close there was\nessentially nothing in it as promised I\nran both an external noise test and a\nsubjective Comfort test on a specific\nComfort Road to dig in exactly what\nthese tires would be like to live within\nthe real world I.E rough surfaces\npotholes cobbles and impact bars the red\nStein did have the lowest noise on test\nwith the Michelin and Falcon extremely\nclose and the prey scoring well too the\nContinental was the worst in the noise\ntest but it wasn't that far off so I\ndefinitely wouldn't be worried about the\nnoise of any of these tires I certainly\ndidn't notice it subjectively Comfort\nwas led by the Michelin Primacy 4 plus\nit's not unusual for this tire to do\nwell in Comfort testing it just feels\ngreat around and does a fantastic job on\nbig impacts like potholes in a close\nsecond place was continental and fredin\nneither were quite as smooth as the\nFrench tire but really they weren't too\nfar off and then it was the preli and\nfulcon just a tiny bit further behind\nboth these tires felt as good as the\nbest on things like cobbles and stones\nbut they did transmit a little bit more\nimpact into the chassis when striking\nhard impacts the far Stone was good over\na single impact but got a little bit\nuneasy over constant small bumps like\ncobbles and the good trip was still\ndetermined to give you a bad trip as it\nwas quite a lot firmer than the rest of\nthe tires the rolling resistance or the\nenergy use of the tires is becoming more\nimportant with every passing year and a\ntire that does rolling resistance well\nalong with everything else is a rare\nfind case in point the Firestone had the\nlowest rolling resistance by nearly 5%\ncompared to the second place tire but it\nwasn't that great in the way if you\nignore the Firestone all the other tires\nwere Incredibly Close I wonder if tire\nmanufacturers have found a sweet spot\nwith the tire labeling anyway pry and\nContinental both did the best job of\nblending low rolling resistance and wet\ngrip in my opinion but the Falcon and\nFred Stein were again very close behind\nso the overall results firmly in last\nplace is the good trip gr66 as I said\nearlier it was by no means the worst\ncheap tire I've ever used but then in\nthis size it's not really that cheap and\nit's still pretty awful in every test\nespecially wet braking which was nearly\n40% off the best that means if you find\nyourself breaking from a highway speed\nof 70 mph or 130 kph in the wet you'll\nstill be doing 68 km an hour when you\nwould be stopped on the best that's a\nbig crash next up you have the Firestone\nroadhawk to Enlighten this tire lives up\nto its enlightened name with the lowest\nrolling resistance and was a nicely\nbalanced Tire in the BMW however it was\nlacking just a little bit of wack grip\nwhich cost it a better placing overall\nin fifth place is the Michelin Primacy 4\nplus there's not a lot I can say about\nthis tire I've not said already it's a\nlovely refined Tire to drive but lacks a\nlittle bit of grip especially in the wet\nluckily the Michelin Primacy 5 has just\nbeen announced I didn't know it was\ncoming when I tested these at the end of\nlast year and Michelin say the pracy 5 5\nhas much improved wet grip which sounds\nextremely promising subscribe to see\nthat tie tested as soon as I can get my\nhands on it I'm very excited about it it\nhas a good sidewall too then you have\nthe Duro of the red Stein ultrak and the\nFalcon Zas zi 320 finishing very\nsimilarly overall in fact looking at the\ndata it's crazy how close they are so\nI'm calling this a joint third both\ntires had nearly identical Drive braking\nat wer breaking they were both fantastic\nto drive in the wet they had pretty much\nthe same straight Aqua planing though\nthe red Stein was slight better in\ncurved aquip planing nearly identical\nnoise profiles and just about the same\nrolling resistance the Rin was a tiny\nbit better in comfort and the Falcon was\na tiny bit better in dry handling so if\nthey're priced similarly in your region\nthat's your difference that just leaves\nthe new continental and the new pry\nwhile the Continental was a little bit\nbehind overall on points it was again so\nclose I'm calling them joint test\nwinners as we've come to expect from the\nPremium Contact 7 this was one of the\nkings of the wet with the best sweat\nbraking the best Straight Aqua planing\nand very good curved Aqua planing it\nalso had good Comfort levels and low\nrolling resistance and it was good in\nthe dry the downside the balance wasn't\nquite as good as the prey otherwise it's\nstill an outstanding Tire finally the\nbrand new just released pry citrato C3\nis an excellent upgrade to replace the\np7 C2 this tire is now probably the most\nfun you can have in this category\nespecially in the dryer and for that I\ncommend it and it has the grip to match\nit with the best dry braking it was also\nvery good in the wet 1.4 Bes the\nContinental in wet braking faster in wet\nhandling and had the best curved aquip\nplaning it Blends all of that with a low\nrolling resistance and a low noise the\nonly slight drawback of the new tire was\nthe Comfort it scored just half a point\nbehind the continental and the\ndifferences are that small so I wouldn't\nreally call it a deciding factor it\nstill rode very nicely the sidewall\nhowever that might decide it for me in\nsummary pry have done an excellent job\nwith the new citrato C3 continuing their\nrun of excellent form with their new\naftermarket tires their Continental\nPremium Contact 7 definitely still has\nit and the new Falcon and rone products\nare also outstanding they're getting\nvery very close to the best obviously\nthe next question is can the new Primacy\n5 take back the lead I'm excited to find\nout now please go review

bottles\nand a sheep on my back and I don't know\nif you can see my smile but to last a\npill pool to camp it's time to heat up\nsome Baxter\nand doesn't look like any bears are\nfollowing me it's not suppose super\nexcited at a dinner she oughta whiskey\ntop it off\n[Music]\nI know it doesn't show right now well\nmm-hmm really tired deep inside\nearly judge Baga let's later on all the\nleads and they grew never ready they\nslay whole human race making dollars off\nour face or your hands getting stained\ntransaction ties so we got live to count\nyour cards and hold your breath or the\nfumo state of mind but they it's a\npaycheck to paycheck\nlet's guy Kevin\nanother ram in the salt add and\nwaiting to get to the creek go to the\nairstrip hopefully it transferred to a\ndifferent camp for charging everything\nup going through cleaning up or packs\nbatteries and cards and watching and\nyour cape the head\nyes more sheep meat for lunch three\nsteaks over there backstrap steaks and a\npot full of white sighs we got it all\npacked up in three packs we're gonna\nhead down the mountain here to the river\nyou know let it clears and maybe we can\nget out this evening\nif not we'll sit down there and eat some\nmore sheep meat\nwish we had more with\nbut we're out here that's all nice so\nwe're gonna say bye to this awesome camp\nspot you'll find a new one rejuvenating\njust got the feeling back in my toes\n[Applause]\nJace's right I'm down to the riverbed\nover here a little bit we'll hear the\nsound of an airplane I know they got a\nchange today something another hunter is\ncoming in for I think air boot camp it's\ngonna clear that stick stop some banks\ndown get some ribbon and flag it all and\nmake the call I left my gloves about two\nmiles upriver if I might be putting on\nmy running shoes and run it up there and\ngrab it um we'll see but first things\nfirst go get the runway built and get to\ncarry with you something let's see guys\na little bit\nso this is day day 12 in the field the\neleventh day of hunting chase has been\ncarrying the bow with the quiver for the\ntrip we shot it at a ptarmigan but\nthat's it we haven't had any any other\nopportunity chase tried with the Sheep\none day but it didn't work out so\nhaven't got to shoot it so we just took\na couple shots into the dirt bank and we\njust filled a key small meat bag up with\nmoss and grass we're just gonna keep\nshooting it make sure it's still along\ndead center ready to go caribou pretty\nawesome though PSC carbon air stealth\nwhisker biscuit kind of a cheap true\nglow made of carbon fiber lightweight it\nsings 4.2 pounds as it is and we can get\nfold-out jizz BAP TKO with never head\nthe practice set screw and so the wings\ndon't open and go clean that thing up in\nthe creek so Kevin just took off running\nafter his gloves that he misses dearly\nand in the direction Kevin was headed\nwe've got a wolf track slightly fresh\nheaded towards Kevin and\nwhere'd it go here oh yes here it is\nthat right there guys is a bear track\nhad claws\nthere's Kevin's tennis shoe print\nthere's the bear track another bear\ntrack never mind he's still there we\ndidn't get flown out but I can't move\ndown to the river a couple of runways\nbuilt for super Cubs come pick us up and\nI am a mile from camp the can of bear\nspray and my running shoes on looking\nfor a pair of gloves I laid down when we\nwent into our shoes yesterday so just\ngoing for a nice jog in grizzly country\nand hopes to find on my shoes or my\ngloves\nwell in my underwear shoes bear spray\nall worth it\nthese sons of we're hiding right\nthere alright I can proceed I get back\nto camp because I'm freezing my ass we\nkilled doll seat buddy been an adventure\nhopefully it's not over yet missing wife\nand kiddos but hopefully we can make the\nmost of the few more days on here\nit'd be a lot less expensive\nthe RAM right there this room\nright back there that sunshine\nwe're leaving this camp spot we've got\nour airstrip built over here tubs gonna\ncome from that direction come in and\npick us up and then we're gonna fly out\nto care boot camp and hopefully today's\nour 12th day of hiking so we have three\ndays of hunting well with any luck we'll\nget a care of it\nyou thought I don't know where to begin\nit's triple the lifetime light it's\nnothing that I ever nothing that I ever\nanticipated the mountains are just\neverywhere you look unreal how big the\nmountains seem endless\nwhen you're climbing on you look at them\nand you you think there's no way I'll\nget up there with all this gear and get\nto where these sheep are living but you\njust one step at a time and next thing\nyou know you're on top of the world\noverlooking the Northwest Territories is\njust unreal\nloading up in a couple super Cubs gonna\nhead for caribou camp I'm not sure where\nthat is yet but hopefully it has more\ncaribou than here got a couple days left\nof hunting and should be a beautiful day\nto fly\ntoo much camera\nyou see that\n6:11 kevin and i got flown in what they\ncall grizzly Creek it's named that for a\nreason and we're grabbing a snack and in\n12 hours so six
