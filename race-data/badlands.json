Granada provides excellent access via multiple airports, but self-supported format means managing 100km+ desert stretches with zero resupply. \"The event organisers had agreed with a cafe in Gor to open for 24 hours for the riders, which proved to be invaluable,\" Bradley notes about the strategic support points."

          "transcript": "[Music]\nBadlands 2025 was the most\nbreathtakingly beautiful ride I've ever\ndone, but it was also without question\nthe hardest thing I've ever taken on. It\ngave me the highest highs and the lowest\nlows. I knew the event would be hard,\nbut the level of difficulty still\nshocked me.\nThis is a story of my first ever ultra\nbike packing race. 800 km of rugged\nterrain across southern Spain, my\nlongest ride ever on a bike, and an\nexperience that pushed me far beyond the\nlimits of suffering I thought was\npossible.\nLet me start with what made the event\nunforgettable. The route and the people.\nThe Ultra community is unlike any other\nin cycling. While it's 800 kilometers of\nbrutal terrain, the race feels\nremarkably accessible. It's not\ndominated by aero obsessed riders in\nskin suits chasing marginal gains.\nInstead, there's a mix of everyday\ncyclists, first timers, and people who\nlike me just had the aim to finish. It\nfelt inclusive, warm, and supportive.\nAnd the route. Oh my goodness me. The\nroute. I was blown away by the sheer\nvariety of the landscapes we rode\nthrough. One moment you're riding\nthrough a desert landscape the likes of\nwhich I'd never seen in my life before.\nThe next through a forest, then along a\ncoaster road along a beach and then fast\nopen plains. It was never ever boring.\nAnd each section felt like a new chapter\nin a story. The highlight for me was the\ngraph desert. It was truly truly\nbreathtaking on another level. A real\nspecial highlight for me. And riding\nthrough landscapes like that, you\nrealize the event is more than a race.\nIt's a journey through some of the most\nbeautiful parts of the world. I felt\nvery lucky, very fortunate to experience\nsuch amazing landscapes.\nAnd so to my race, the race began slowly\nfor me deliberately. So, I spent the\nopening kilometers chatting with people,\nmaking friends, and resisting the urge\nto go much faster than I wanted to. So,\nsuper mellow start, keep my heart rate\ndown and just ease into it because,\nwell, it's a long day. What's a rush?\nEnjoying the views after we head out of\ntown. Soon the tarmac gave way to the\ngravel and we well onto the first big\nclimb, taking off 1,000 meters of\nclimbing in just 28 kilometers. And that\nset the tone as the first 300 km of the\nroute, but basically one big climb.\n&gt;&gt; I'm so glad to finally be riding the\nbike. The last two days have been awful\nfor my anxiety and nerves\njust ftting about my bike setup and all\nthe things that I need to over think\nabout.\nBut now we finally started. It's just a\ncase of riding the bike, turning the\npedals.\nThis, I guess, is the easy bit. Plenty\nof suffering ahead, I'm sure,\nbut no more stress, anxiety, and worry.\nBecause what a be will be. And look at\nthe view.\nSo, first water stop for the route.\nWe've done 3 hours and 15 minutes and\n1600 m of climbing and 60 km.\nTaking along nice and steady so far.\n&gt;&gt; Nice and steady.\n&gt;&gt; Nice and steady. Tapping it along. Um,\nyeah, lots to go. I was really pleased\nwith how well I paced myself and found a\nnice rhythm early on. I was eating and\ndrinking properly and felt strong. The\nfirst day was really enjoyable. Even\nwith temperature soaring in the desert\nto 46° and by riding past 360 km, I set\na new PB for my longest ride ever. And\nnow I was into unknown territory for my\nbody. So right now we're riding through\nthe Gap Desert, the only desert in\nEurope apparently. And it's epic.\nAbsolutely breathtaking.\n80 km of desert. And it's just so\ndramatic.\nSo, been a while since I've spoken to my\nlittle camera friend. done 12 hours now\nand about 230 km.\nSo, not even yeah, not even making a\ndent on the overall distance. It's been\na mighty tough day. My plan now to ride\nthrough a night. I think we got about 80\nkm of climbing left, including Europe's\nhighest paved road. So, yeah, it should\nbe a walk in the park. But from the top,\nit's all downhill to the beach. And now\nI have siesta, ice cream, dip in the\nocean.\nI just want to get the climbing done.\nThe first 300k of the route are all\nclimbing. Just keen to get the climbing\ndone. And riding through a night should\nbe fun as well. So, I'm currently\nrefueling\na Fanta,\ntwo Fanta, Pringles, Gatorade, water,\nand I just done a magnum. Very pro knot.\nI had a I won't lie, I had quite a low\nthrough desert. The heat,\nme, the heat was intense. And the final\nclimb out of the desert after having a\nsandwich. I was in a bad place. My first\nbig low\nof the uh event so far. And hopefully\none I won't have again cuz mother har it\nwas hard work to dig myself out of that\nhole.\nBut managed to keep going. Hola.\n&gt;&gt; Crazy.\ncrazy people.\n&gt;&gt; Y\n&gt;&gt; I stopped in a town called Gore. The\nsupermarket open\nand yeah, refueling, recharge batteries,\nhave a bit of a 10-minute rest.\nEven though I'm trying to ride slowly\nand keep my heart rate down, it's still\njust taking a toll.\nI'm trying to be efficient, steady in\nthe climbs and fast everywhere else.\nUsing the arrow bars, I love the arrow\nbars. Just comfort, air gains, just\nreducing that power requirement. Um,\nyeah. The only thing that is really\nhurting so far, my feet. My feet are\nkilling me. I think the heat and\nthe hard pedaling and the pounding\nthrough the pedals and the rough ground.\nIt's so rough in places. My feet are on\nfire. Even though they're fantastic\nshoes, not the shoes fault, it's just\nthe terrain and the heat. The heat.\nI think it's like 36, excuse me, 36°.\nSo, not even like crazy hot,\nbut I don't I can't cope the heat. Not\nwhen riding up a massive climb on gravel\nwith a bike that weighs many kilograms\nwith three bottles on it and two b uh 2\nliters on my backpack.\nYeah. Anyway,\nlovely evening. Temperatures come down\nreal lows now. Half moon up there.\nIt'll be a nice evening. So, yeah.\nOnwards. So, my plan for the race was a\nride through the first night out of\nrespect for the race and because I\nthought it would be a fun challenge. And\nthat night proved magical. The long\nclimb to observatory on smooth forest\nroads under cool starry sky was\nunforgettable and the temperature had\ndropped to 10° which made riding a bike\nfor me much much easier and I felt\nreally good. Uh top of the um\nthe main big climb really three climbs\nout of ghoul tedious at top but going to\nlayer up for the long mostly descent\ndown to um the beach. Hopefully make the\nbeach by sunrise for breakfast and\nmurder a flat white. Flat white. Flat\nwhite. Flat white right now.\nYeah.\nNight shift. Here we go. Tunes on. Send\nit.\nWell, good morning. I made it through a\nnight unscathed. I'm without sleeping.\nI'm out crashing.\nVery nice experience. Very peaceful.\nLovely temperature for climbing and\ndidn't see anybody really in my own\nlittle bubble. Just wildlife and\nkamicazi rabbits playing chicken in my\nfront wheel. But the sun has risen\nheading towards the beach. Had a first\ncoffee of the day. I'm not feeling too\nbad. Not great. Not terrible.\n400 km is coming up. So, just now 400 km\nto go. Halfway there. Jesus. Jesus.\nAnyway,\nby sunrise, I reached a coast of Rose.\nMy spirits lifted by the view of the sea\nand a lovely sunrise. And I was feeling\nreally good. I carried on along the\ncoast to Almira, the biggest town on the\nroute, arriving late Monday afternoon.\nMy plan at this milestone was simple.\ntry and eat a decent amount of real\nfood, recharge my Wahoo and phone, then\ntake on a final 200 kilometers or so in\none go riding through the second night\nand had a vague idea given my pace so\nfar to finish early Tuesday morning\ngiving me a time around 50 hours and\nhopefully hold on to my top 20 position.\nOh, how good I felt. But with hindsight,\nthe wheels began to fall off the wagon.\nFrom our mirror, two massive climbs\nstood between me and the finish line. I\ntackled the first climb at sunset, and I\nstill felt really strong. My nutrition\ngame was on point. My legs weren't tired\nat all, but I still felt the first signs\nof fatigue and sleep deprivation. So, I\nallowed myself a 30 minute nap on a\ngravel track. Not the best place to\nsleep at all. I set a timer on my phone\nfor 30 minutes and it went off straight\naway. But even after that 30-minute nap,\nI felt recharged and carried on. But\nthen in the middle of the night,\nsomewhere over top of that climb out of\nour mirror, things went very very very\nbadly wrong. I don't remember the\nprecise moment, but I found it\nimpossible to keep my head up. And all\nof a sudden,\nI could no longer keep my head upright\nand looking ahead where I going. And my\nhead was just drooping down like that.\nAnd that was something I'd never ever\nexperienced before. The strangest\nsensation, the most alarming sensation\nI've ever experienced. Every bump in the\ngravel felt like torture sending pain\nshooting out the back of my neck. The\ndescents were sketchy and dangerous. I\ntrying to ride one-handed with my hand\non my chin to hold my head up where\npossible, but the route was so bumpy and\nsketchy. You had to have both hands on\nthe brakes to control your speed or else\nyou would crash. And where it was smooth\nand allowed, I had one hand on the try\nextensions and used my elbow on the\nother armrest pad and did that. But the\nroute, like I say, is so rough and\nbumpy. There are precious few places\nwhere you could ride like that. And out\nof desperation,\nat some point during sunrise, when I got\nto the bottom of that descent and the\nnext climb, I found a spare strap in my\none of my bags and tied the back of my\nhelmet to my hydration pack to try and\nhold my neck and head up, which worked\nwith very limited success at all because\nmy helmet would just pull back and my\nhydration pack would just pull up and\ndidn't really provide the solution I\nhoped it might. So I gave up on that\nafter a short while and I've resigned to\na very very slow final 140 km. Nothing\nprepared me for it at all. It wasn't on\nmy list of worries or concerns going\ninto the race at all and I'm still in a\nbit of shock that it happened and still\nin discomfort a week later after it\nhappened. By morning I reached a small\ntown but everything was shut. I refilled\nat a fountain, grabbed a quick nap about\n15 minutes and pressed on. And the next\n20 km climb nearly broke me. The\nfrustration, the discomfort, the\nrelentless pain, it was all consuming.\nEven the majestic sunrise could not lift\nmy spirits and the final 140 km would\ntake me near 12 hours. 12 hours of pure\nsuffering. I kept stopping, unable to\nfocus, just wanting the race to be over.\nBut in a race like Badlands, there's no\neasy way out. There's no support.\nThere's no shortcut. And the only option\nis to keep moving. And I lost loads and\nloads of places. Tumbling out of the top\n20 is right past me one by one. My legs\nstill felt strong. Legs still felt\ngreat, but about my neck, I was\npowerless.\nA long, long time later, as Tuesday\nevening arrived, I eventually rolled\ninto Granada, crossed the finish line,\ncollected my medal, went straight to my\nhotel, had a slow shower, and collapsed\ninto bed for 12 hours of solid sleep. I\ndid not move for 12 hours. I was broken,\nshattered, exhausted, but relieved to\nhave finished.\nFor me, Badlands was a race of two\nhalves. The first two days were pure\njoy, the best I've ever felt on a bike.\nMy legs were strong, my nutrition\nflawless, and I was in my element. The\nonly real challenge was the heat, but\nthe final push was brutal. When my neck\ngave out, I reached the lowest point\nI've ever known on a bike in my life. It\nwas pure misery. Now, less than a week\nlater, my body still aches everywhere,\nand I'm still so tired. And yet, I kind\nof miss it. There's a strange sadness\nwhen it's over. as if we've all lived\ninside a unique bubble together and then\nhad to return to the real world. People\nkeep asking if I do it again. And my\nanswer is simple. Absolutely. Yes. The\ncourse and the experience, the people\nwere incredible. But I have no real eye\nright now to go back and do it faster.\nCheap on the road. Sheep on the road.\nHey, sheep.\nBadlands was a lifechanging experience.\nNo regrets at all. Even with the\nsuffering I experienced, I feel calm,\ngrateful, and very lucky to have done it\nand met so many amazing people and r\nthrough such a breathtaking landscape.\nBut I can definitely say I've got the\nultra bug though. For me, I think one\nultra a year feels like the right\nbalance. the amount I put into it,\npreparation, doing the event and the\nsuffering afterwards, the amount of time\nit takes, I think one per year is\nprobably the right approach for me right\nnow. And there are so many other amazing\nevents out there around the world. And\nwhat excites me most is exploring new\nplaces by bike.\nBadlands 2025 reaffirms why ultra\ndistance bike packing continues to grow\nin popularity. It's not about chasing\nspeed or podiums, but about exploring\nthe limits of human endurance and\ndiscovering landscapes few ever\nexperienced by a bicycle. For many\nriders, it will not be the last. The\nsuffering fades. Bad lands, like all\ngreat adventures, leave people both\nexhausted and inspired, eager for next\njourney. wherever it may lead. So, a\nmassive thank you to all the organizers\nof Bad Lands for the hard work putting\non such an amazing event and to all the\npeople who took part and who I met and\nspoke with and rode and supported me and\npushed me on when I was suffering this\nyear. A truly remarkable event and maybe\nmaybe I'll see you there next year. But\nthat's my experience of doing my first\never ultra bike packing race. This video\nhas been sponsored by Insta 360 and the\nAce Pro 2. This my setup for Badlands.\nThe camera and this mouthguard which\nacts as a handle and removes at a press\nof two buttons like that. And the Ace\nPro 2 is amazing for capturing any sort\nof bike adventure, especially one like\nBadlands. You have a high quality Leica\nlens. Amazing for capturing all the the\nsaturation, all the color of the Spanish\ndesert. And it works in low light as\nwell with a dedicated pure video mode.\nAnd I especially love the flip up\nscreen. So when you're talking to the\ncamera doing that vlog segment, you can\nsee your framed uh properly in that\nscreen there. The front screen gives you\nthe runtime and memory space on the SD\ncard inside there as well. and just\nsuper easy to use with loads of modes\nfor whatever you're doing. You can\neasily customize the camera as you want\nas well. And I have it set up with two\npresets. I have a vlog mode and then a\nbiking mode. So the biking mode is wide\nangle to capture the handlebars and my\narms doing that bike riding thing and\nthen the vlog mode which narrows down\nthat field of view and gives me that\nnice vlogging uh angle I want. And you\ncan change your settings very easy. Nice\ntouchcreen, very responsive. You can\nchange the resolution up to 8K if you\nwant. I shot in 4K 24 frames per second\nto conserve the battery to make the run\ntime last for the entire race. And it's\na rugged camera as well. It goes through\nthe heat of the desert and the cold of\nthe nighttime low temps. You can drop\nit. It's tough and durable. And the\nsound quality is better than ever before\nwith a new wind guard on the front to\ncapture really uh really crispy audio\nand some really clever AI inside the\ncamera now to really improve the the\nsound quality. And as you see, I made\none small modification to the camera by\nadding two dead cats to the two\nmicrophones here just to reduce that\nwind noise when riding along and filming\nmyself having a fun time on a bike.\nAlongside the Ace Pro 2, my other\nfavorite camera is the X5, a 360 camera\nthat shoots in stunning 8K resolution.\nIt's easy to mount on a bike or your\nbody, making it super simple to capture\na wide range of angles that can refframe\nafter you ride via the smartphone or\ndesktop app. The larger sensor and\nbuilt-in wing guard deliver excellent\nimage and audio quality, and now more\ndurable, thank replaceable lenses and a\nlonger lasting battery. So, grab\nyourself an Ace Pro 2 or an X5 or one of\nthe many other amazing cameras from the\nInsta 360 range on their website.

here\nall our spares and everything I'm\neffectively taking most of the stuff\nhopefully that we won't need so we're\nbasically reading the race as like the\nfirst part of the race is like our\nnormal racing so we'll probably do like\n990 G an hour then we'll be able to like\nsettle in we're not going to sleep okay\nso we're just going to keep going um\neffectively I think it's all about like\nwe want to be self-sufficient for the\nfirst 24 hours what we'll do is we'll\ntry and carry that knowing that we have\nit in sachet and gels and everything\nelse and then food as a bonus put my har\nB stting cuz that just keeps me going\nwhat's mad though if you think in our\nshorter races we probably actually would\ndelete this\nthere we go it's getting\non hello rafie hey how you doing I just\nsaw your uh your strategy laid out at\nthis good um the only thing that you're\ngoing to need to add a little bit more\nof is electrolytes it's going to get hot\nout there uh so throw a tube of 1500 in\nif you can cool okay what about Bradley\nwhat have you done\nstar you've got about 35 hours worth of\nfuel based on the plan so if you can up\nit a little bit and not fully rely on\npicking up bagets and Fant\nyou'll be gold okay cool add a few more\ncarbs perfect you can do that I can do\nthat then every time I fill up my pack I\nthink I'm just going to whack a couple\nof these in that is the stuff of dreams\nfeel I'm going to pack mine a bit more\norganized when is it is organized\norganized chaos yeah like our\nlives unbelievable\nwe are at 100K in\nit's been\neventful Danny what just happened I just\nhit the deck [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hard like there's like\nRiver rivets in the ground and my bik H\nit and it should take it so basically my\nbars clearly don't have enough

a\nDIY\nsatav but we move we're going to make it\nthough and that's only the first 100k\nI know we always come across as quite\njokey but we are taking this on quite\nserious like we do want to do well\nthat's why we have the the nutrition\nplan in place it's why we've been kind\nof prepping for this a little bit more\nlike it's important for us this one see\nyeah be be good to see how we go

          "transcript": "Hi everyone, welcome to Granada where\ntomorrow I'll be joining the Bedlands\n2024 ultra cycling race.\nSo we are about 15 16k into the route.\nUh we are in the Sierra de Puetto, I\nthink. Fantastic landscape. The part\noutside of Granada is brutally uh\nsteep and uh yeah, there's probably 5K\nin the end of the first time. The first\nday was\num 190 kilometers. I started at uh 8:00\na.m. um in the morning in Granada and\nuh probably stopped at 3:00 a.m. It was\nuh an epic ride. I rode hard. The start\nwas like full Gaz immediately because of\na 20 kilometers climb.\n[Music]\nOkay. So, while you enjoy this fantastic\nlandscape,\nuh really really remote this uh trail\nhere, a little update on the race so\nfar. Like I said, the road out of uh the\nfirst part, the first four, 5ks leaving\nGranada is like absolutely brutal, super\nsteep. The road is narrow. There were\n300 people. Then as it always happens,\nyou know, the huge group become thinner\nand thinner and then you suddenly are\nthere pedalling on your own. The area so\nfar has been wow very remote. Very\nbeautiful but very remote. A lot of\ntough climbs. Uh I am uh I've been\nriding 4 hours uh including uh\nstops. I'm looking for\nuh looking forward to a fountain. I want\nto refill my bottles and I'm really\nhungry. I mean, I surely have gels and\nbars, but I really need to eat something\nnow. A little bit of this sand to\nrest. All\ngood. I just had a break. I washed\nmyself. I ate in that town down\nthere. And uh I did roughly 62\nkilometers, but there is a lot of climb.\nSo there was really a lot and uh yeah I\nate something. Now I'm continuing is\nextremely hot. Now it we cross the\nsecond ecosystem is called Granada\nGranada Gio Park before the Gorafa\ndesert is about uh 60 70 kilometers is\nwhat I will start now. So good because\nthe desert then it will be in the\nevening maybe when it's cooler.\nEverything seemed smooth and fine\nuntil reaching uh the ramp up to the\nMiridor defend\nMundo.\nSo I am here pushing the bike\nshamelessly but\nunavoidably up to this ramp that has to\nbe at least\n30% or more. I'm even struggling to push\nthe bike uphill. I mean, at 6:00 a.m.\nwith no bag, I could do it. I mean,\neverybody I see behind was walking\nit. And yeah, there uh have been a\nseries of super technical\nparts, including this, although it's\ndecent. Uh landscape is great. But uh\nyeah, the first\nwas an incredibly\nsteep 1.5 to 2ks climb. I bet that was\n30%. Had to walk it and everybody I saw\nalso worked it. And uh and even then it\nwas very hard to push the bike. So I\ndon't know. Uh yeah, I've done a lot of\nsuper tough climbs. Not on a ultra\ncontext, but yeah, that is like insanely\nsteep. Impossible to climb. Then there\nwas an extremely ragged Oh, wow. I'm\ninto a town now.\nFantastic. Uh an extremely ragged part\nwhere again you had to come down and\npush the bike because like simply the\ntrail was broken in two or three parts\nuh the same direction you were going. So\nit was like kind of impossible to find\nto find your lane. I mean uh and then\nthis other part here with a lot of sand\nwhich was kind of a pain in the\nbutt. This is the de Santor. We are\naround uh\n100ks. I plan to do around 180 or\nsomething like that today and then try\nto find something to sleep there. Uh\nnice location for\nanita. Huge\ngrass.\nUh the location is really really remote.\nTook a long time getting through\nhere. The building looks\nnew. I mean hard to reach very often.\nHeat. Heat.\non the way to Goraf which was a crucial\npoint not only because that's where I I\nplan to have dinner or anyway I plan to\nhave a major refueling but also I knew\nthat after Gorafa there will there will\nbasically be nothing and there will be\nthe 80ks uh Gorafa desert loop I was\nlike kind of nervous particularly\nbecause I didn't really have um much\nexperience running at night and because\nI reached Gorafa much later than I\nthought I wood. The prospect was for\nseveral hours of\nuh nighttime riding. Gafe was reaching\nit. This place there was not uh not not\nmuch food available cuz like uh the\nriders were arrived earlier. The the\ncore of the pelon basically ate up\nalmost everything and so there was\nreally no choice. I had to eat something\nI wasn't really too crazy about.\nabout an hour ago, maybe less. But\nanyway, I left the Goraf, the gate to\nthe Goraf desert, and I'm now riding.\nIt's\nuh uh 2100. It's sunset. It's great.\nIt's really cool. Today it was a\nnightmare in terms of\nuh heat. Now I am a bit behind schedule\nof what I had thought I would be at this\ntime but I can\nuh uh try to make up for some of that\nroad. Now I had a\ndinner steak with the potatoes. They\ndidn't have anything in this small\nrestaurant. like everything had been\nalready finished by\nuh those who arrived first. Uh including\nwater. There was no water. There was no\nCoke. There was no Fanta. Only Sprite.\nAnyway, it's fine. I had my dinner. I\nhad even a an ice cream. The type my\ndaughter would love. Yeah, I had it\ntonight. And uh yeah I want to share\nthis uh beautiful\nplace is one of the most iconic\nthe in the last year 2023 this section\nwas\nremoved because of uh rain. So I hope\nit's uh not a luck in these guys. But\nyeah I mean like I said the weather is\nreally good. Let's see the bike good. I\nneed to clean the chain a bit and the\ntransmission. I have some\nuh wet wipes for bicycle. They are from\nthe Sudal Quickstep team. I mean, they\nare good. Uh tomorrow I'll spend some\ntime to clean and uh apply some extra\nchain lube. I don't have much, but uh it\nshould be\nfine.\nUh I'm not happy with the bag. I have\nApidura saddle bag. I will explain more\nlater, but has been bouncing and making\nnoise is a pain in the butt. I I I\nreally think the tail fin I forgot the\nname of the motor, but the one that kind\nof is attached to the\nuh seat stay is way\nbetter for uh different reasons. And\nyeah, then uh let's see. Uh hydration\nwas fine today.\nSo when I\narrived to Gafe, I had zero liquid\nleft. And yeah, now this part is a bit\ntechnical as you can see. Somebody\ndropped a\nbottle. And uh wow, it's\nbeautiful. And yeah, I mean\nuh of course there were there were ups\nand downs mentally, but uh now I'm\nfeeling good.\nUh, I have a a helmet mount Phoenix\nlight system ready on my helmet to kick\non when uh once the sun sets, which\nprobably is going to happen in the next\nminutes. And uh yeah, I'll need to\nreduce my speed once it's dark\nobviously. And uh yeah. All right, I'm\ngoing to close the cam to focus a bit\nhere. All right.\n[Applause]\nvery technical descent for crying out\nloud. You walk it or Yeah.\nWhen I finally reached the place where I\ndecided to stop was like\nuh a B&amp;B, a super small one that\nwouldn't show up in any booking\nplatform, contacted Goraf to confirm\nthey had space and they had and\nlike I was stressed cuz I would I knew I\nwould reach this place very late and I\nhad no idea whether uh the guy will\nstill be there or like there will be\nnothing and I will need to be in the\nmiddle of nowhere pretty much. And\nuh yeah, when I finally reached the\nplace at 3:00 a.m., the guy was still\nthere. Maybe a bit pissed, but he was\nthere and it was it was nice. I was able\nto call it a day. We went to sleep, if\nwe can talk about sleep, thinking that\nmaybe the following day I would just\nride until Gore, which was I think 40 or\nsomething kilometers from where I was,\nand then maybe rest for the day.\nEventually, I didn't do that. I was glad\nI didn't. But like that's the thought I\nhad in my mind when around 4:00 a.m. I\nwas able maybe to close my eyes after\nwashing my beeps and\neverything. I slept very little, but I'm\ngood. And uh yeah, I had breakfast, a\nhuge breakfast, and I'm in the desert.\nSee how beautiful. And uh yeah, I\ncleaned the bicycle and\nuh prepared everything. Day number two.\nUm started with a big breakfast in the\nB&amp;B where I stopped. The host was really\nkind. Uh had a long chat. I I needed it.\nI needed the breakfast especially, but I\nrealized now I how much time I wasted in\ngeneral. I didn't really have a ultra\nmindset of like optimizing the time\nconsumption. an error. I will definitely\nnot do the next time I'm riding an\nultra. But uh yeah, I mean and then\nfinal part of the Gorafa desert until uh\nI reach Gore. We are in the last part of\nthe desert of\nGoraf.\nUh like it's impossible to\nbe great at every every part of the\ntriathon. Yeah. You will always have a\nstrong uh discipline, an intermediate\none and an awful\none. Go was amazing. I decided to\nbasically stop from 1500 to 1,800 to\navoid the hottest hours of the day. And\nso I basically spent 3 hours. It is\ntrue. I recovered and I only slept 3\nhours the night before if we can talk\nabout sleep. And so I really needed that\nrecovery. I ate, you know, I wash, I\nclean everything. I I went to the mini\nmarket and everything, but I lost three\nhours. And\nso the logic seemed obvious at the time.\nJust uh don't ride in the hottest moment\nof the day. Ride more when it's cooler.\nBut I also lost more hours. Then I did\nthe uh feared climb up to the Calaralto.\nThat was supposed to be the highest\npoint for you know the altitude. the\nplace uh\n2,160 or 70 m above sea level I think.\nBut the main difficult aspect of the\nclim of this climb to Karalto was the\nfact that there would be no resupply at\nall. But then like I did it with uh you\nknow I was in pretty high spirit when I\nleft go. I had eaten plenty. I have\nrefueled and cooled down um very well. I\nwas feeling good. The few first climbs\nafter leaving Gore, I did it with very\ngood legs, which was like a nice\nsurprise after the level of difficulty\ninvolved on the first day. And uh I was\nhappy, you know, I had my strategy. I\nknew what I would do. I would ride until\nKaralto and uh and sleep there no matter\nuh you know, I had my BV for a reason. I\ndidn't use it the night before. I was\ngoing to use it no problem. The climb\nwas fine and I was very happy to find\nout that it was fine because I have met\nmultiple riders before that they kind of\ndescribe this climb to Karala from Gore\nto Karalto as like the most difficult\npart of Badlands. The only thing is that\nit was long and so because I was already\nvery tired from the day before I\nwouldn't I wasn't able to really go\nfast.\nI be it without problem. I had a\nminimalistic Biv just basically an\nemergency blanket with an air mat. No\nsleeping bag, nothing. I slept uh you\nknow with the down jacket on and of\ncourse I didn't I I was wearing you know\nthe the cycling kit I had the day before\nand I wasn't cold at all but I was like\nso sweaty because of the humidity and\nlike uh I did not really sleep if I\nslept bad on the night before when I was\nin in that B&amp;B in the Gafa desert. I\nslept even worse now entering and\nexiting sleeping cycles of like maybe 20\nminutes each only and then you know\nwaking up every 20 minutes basically and\nyeah but I got some rest and I was able\nyou know the following day I had a you\nknow there's something in Italy called\npocket coffee is a kind of a\nuh a small uh packaged uh chocolate with\ncoffee inside and I I had one in the\nmorning cuz I need my caffeine when I\nstart and like I had an emergency\nmergency food bag with like um oats and\nchocolate and I just had to hydrate it\nwith some water which I had to spare\nbecause I didn't really get dehydrated\nduring the climb up to Karalto having\ndone it in the night and so I had this\nbreakfast I had my small coffee and like\nI I rested relatively well packed my\nthing and I was able to do the descent\nso camped outside arrived 4:00 a.m.\nsuper tired of Calaraltto which is a\nparked in this uh wide area that host\nthe\nuh space telescope and uh yeah\num the idea\nto come here despite the height is\nbecause uh after this there is a 30k\ndescent uh 3 hours sleep 3 hours sleep\nthe night night before now take a look\nat the telescope It's over there. We are\nat 304\nkilometers. Accumulated elevation is\n6,411 m. More than 1/3 of the whole\nbadlands and yesterday had a\nuninterrupted\nuh except minus uh stops to to meet and\ndrink along the way, but not a long\nstop. 9 hours stage from uh Gore to here\ncrossing the Sierra\nDeath. The idea for today is doing a\nrelatively light\nstage and crashing a hotel\nearly. The stars last night were\nincredible. Yes, I never in my life saw\na star dotted sky as yesterday. And from\nhere\n30k fast maybe called descent.\nHeat.\nWe are in Velik descended 1,200 m\nuh with a really long fast\ndescent\nstaring. Yes, this is the sign of the\nbadlands.\nSo when I reached Belik and in fact when\nI reached Karalon the day before I was\nkind of uh happy very happy because I\nthought this is the highest point of\nBlands from here we are basically going\ndown to the sea to sea level to zero\nfrom 2,00 almost 200 m and uh so I did\nnaively the mistake I mean I knew it\nwould not be straight downhill up to the\nsea because there was like quite the\ndistance still. But like I thought it's\ngoing to be easy then you know then the\nthe part on the coast the cabata was\nalso going to be relatively easy because\nit's like on the coast there is\neverything and so I thought probably the\nworst part of bedlands\num is already behind me but then uh\nimmediately after\nreaching there were already some you\nknow off-road climbs was much more\ndemanding again than I thought it would\nbe and Then\num the estimation I had in my mind of uh\nhow long it will take me to do a certain\ndistance will change because I realized\nhow long it will take. Suddenly there\nwere you know sections which were too\nsteep and with a broken tray that would\nmake impossible to to to pedal and so I\nbasically had to push the bike and all\nthese things slow slow you down a lot.\nI'm here in the shadow taking a\nrest. Third day, Tuesday. Just\nleft de Campo. Had lunch and some\nnon-alcoholic beer. From\ntoa de Campo there is a long section\nkind of almost 30\nkilometers. The first\npart the first say 15 20 kilometers are\nvery beautiful. There is an initial\nclimb out of that is a bit uh steep. Um\nbut then uh then it's nice it's very\nnice but then in the second part before\nreaching debo it's really technical the\nterrain is kind of mountain bike terrain\nheading towards Venta delra after two\nnights with 3 hours\nsleep\nshower and\nuh a good rest and then tomorrow\nplanning a big push.\nCome\nThere you go.\nI knew that on that day I will pass\nthrough a town uh or maybe not even a\ntown through a village called Venta del\nPubre. And I had bookmarked it in the in\nthe research I had done. I had done a\nlot of research before uh before\nBadlands cuz like it was basically a\nmajor highway stop and there was a a\nfuel station, there was a mini market,\nthere was a a bar restaurant and there\nwas a hotel with 24/7\num check in. And so I thought fantastic.\nI mean I'm I'm sure that if I need I\nwill be able to use this place and it\nwas big in my bookmark list. And so I\nknew Ventel Pabri will be a strategic\nplace. After a miserable sleep on the\nfirst night and being at the Colorado\nthe second night, I really wanted a good\nhotel sleep on the third night. Again, I\ndid a lot of things that at the time\nlooked fine. But later on after the end\nof Bedlands, I realized how much time I\nwasted. Next time if I'm going to an\nultra, I'm not doing any such things.\nI'm going to minimize the time wasted\nbecause then I you know I wash the bike\njust you know you want to have a very\ngood transmission and you don't want to\nhave any kind of\nuh sand and kind of grime that is\nslowing you down but at the same time\nyou don't want to necessarily do\nsomething like washing the bike but\nthat's what I did at the time because\nthere was like a a water hose available\nand then I talked a lot with the girl at\nthe reception again I wasn't chithatting\nbut I was asking information about the\nnext towns coming up. I knew that maybe\non the day after, the fourth day, I will\nbe able to reach Nihar. And so I\nthought, let's collect some intelligence\nhere. And then I went to the restaurant,\nhad a burger, uh had two glasses of\ngaspacho.\nWoke up at 4:00\na.m. left half an hour later\nuh from Venta de Pore a highway hotel.\nAfter\nthat, some\nuh fast rolling gravel trails until\nthere is a very steep climb 5 kilometers\nthat brings\nyou up to the top of the hills that uh\nbelong to the park natural\ncabata. Uh once you make it to the\ntop, you reach uh the coast. You see the\ncoast, you see the sea is beautiful. Uh\nit's sunrise now is amazing. It's very\ncool. The place\nuh here and before along the uh earlier\nmiles today extremely humid. Much better\ndoing it now than\num in the hottest moments of the day.\nUh yeah, as you can see, this is a rare\nmoment of asphalt, but otherwise it's\nbeen gravel for the largest\nmajority of\nBlands. Now we are supposed within 5K to\nreach a playa a beach. It's going to be\nnice to be at sea level.\nHi. While I put back I just changed the\nGoPro battery. While I put everything\nback and get ready to start a quick\nupdate. We are on the Via Verde in a\nsection that goes towards Aua Marga.\nuh where uh I plan to have breakfast cuz\nI'm starving. I haven't had a proper\nbreakfast and I've been riding since 5\nbasically. The this section is amazing.\nIt's really beautiful. I I would\nrecommend this together with the area\nafter uh Luca yesterday um called Via\nVerde reaching Aua\nMarga. I knew it would be a tough day\nand that was the point of like cutting\nit short on day three and trying to\nrecover some\nenergy. This noise you are\nhearing, I think it's\nthe front wheel that is out of true.\nThere must be some loose spokes. I will\nsee if I can fix something tightening\nthe any loose spoke later on.\nIt's not too hot, but uh in this present\nmoment, I can't really go that\nfast. Uh just a breakfast, a really\nreplenishing breakfast. But yeah, I\ncan't\nfeel much kick in my legs now.\nthis Place is called a Cortico del Fry.\n1:40. Started the ride at 5 a.m. this\nmorning from Venta del\nPorra. Uh huge climb before entering in\nthe Cabo de Capo Deata. Capo Deata is\nfantastic.\nNow h the\ndesignated stop for the day is\nNAR which is at the base of a huge climb\nthat uh yeah I need to have a rest\nbefore doing so that we go for uh uh\nearly tomorrow. after the Playa de\nMonsul. It was the climb up to the Tora\nde la Blanca totally off road, but it\nwas like compact gravel and it was\nbeautiful because like on the right side\nyou had the mountain and on the other\nside you had the cliff with the blue\nocean of the Mediterranean Sea. It was\nfantastic. I had good legs on that day\nso there was really no problem doing the\nclimb up to the to Blanca.\nStill here crossing. ing\nuh the sand a tune basically a very long\none. Uh if I like cycling on the sand I\nwould have bought a fat bike with cross\nthis. I'm going to take off my shoes.\nI'm going in.\nlifting the bike on my\nback. Well, the water is to my knees.\nThe bike excav.\nas Huh? I can\nmake every\nstep. I'm sinking\ninside. I'm\nexhausted by lifting the bike. Just to\ngive you an idea. That's another rider.\nSee, now I need to stop, dry my\nfeet, put back me shoes, and keep\ngoing. I reached Niha around can't\nremember if it was 1900 or 2000, but\nlike uh I was pretty hungry. I knew I\nwouldn't be resting for long cuz I\nwanted to leave earlier on the following\nday. I slept uh no more than 3 hours,\nmaybe two and a half, I can remember. I\nput my alarm clock at\n1:30. Ner was already on the climb um\nwhich would be the the hardest climb in\nthe whole bedlands. It was like a beast\nof\nlike 20 ks in length with like an\naccumulated elevation of uh over 1,000\nm. And so started slowly uh trying to\nfind a sustainable pace relatively.\nEventually I reached the top. I don't\nyou know I didn't really suffer anything\nextreme mentally or physically but it\nwas definitely tough. I knew it would be\na freezing descent. Priority was having\nbreakfast. No real option to have\nanything until reaching Tabernas. There\nwas already a rambla before reaching\nTabernas, but when I did, I was like\nhappy to see that Tabernas had\neverything to the\nTabernas. Very sandy.\nYou need to be careful controlling the\nbike\nthat you don't force it in the wrong\ndirection with this.\nUm, it's uh 8:00\na.m. Soon it will be very hot here. 60ks\nto go to the next station, to the next\ntown.\nAlbolui I think is the name. I woke up\n1:30 left at\nChbury. Uh did a massive 23 kilome climb\nwith a total accumulated elevation of\n1,200 m. It\nwas a very nice climb. I liked it.\nSomebody said it was the most difficult\nof the race. The only thing is that it\nwas above the clouds. Very nice. Though\nit was dark, you could see them.\nAnd uh insanely cold tradition.\nSo the terrain is mostly clay and\nsand and\nuh very fine gravel.\nIt's impossible to come here if it\nrains. I stopped to drink some water. Uh\nit's really fast at least this Rambler.\nAnd uh yeah, some sand, but nothing uh\nno problem at all. Really fast. This uh\nTabernas Desert is definitely one of the\nparts of the whole Badlands uh route\ntogether with uh the Cabo Deata and of\ncourse the Goraf Desert also where I\nwill be very happy to go back but not in\nthe context of a competition, just on my\nown. Um the ramblas were not necessarily\ndifficult until it got very hot. Um\nthere was a good flow. One rambla was uh\nsteeper than the other but not as steep\nas I was initially fearing. One thing\nthat has kind of negatively affected my\nwhole bedlands experience a mechanical\nproblem not a small one to my braking\nsystem. Like I started having some kind\nof signs on the day before where I was\nin Cabo Deata. I thought that it will be\nthe wheel that is out of true in the\nTabernas. It became clear that my brakes\nhad a major problem like the front brake\nwas like breaking less than I was\nhoping. The rotor and the pads of course\nthe pads were totally worn. I didn't\nreally want to stop and investigate too\nmuch because I was in the middle of the\ndesert. It was really hot. There was\nreally no shade available for me to kind\nof uh do some mechanical work around the\nbike. So I decided um let's go\non. So just finished uh I guess like\nfour fifth of the Ramblas of the Tas\nDesert. Now approaching Ali the last\nRambla. No. Yeah. Yeah. Rambla Campio.\nvery technical in my view because of the\num really deep sand and uh slide\ndownhill. I had to put my foot on the\nground several times. I've been riding\nfor almost over 11 hours across the\ndesert. We're\nstarving. Was the first place where I\ncould find pasta in Bedlands. Took a\nrest waiting for the hottest moment of\nthe day to pass. pretty much what I had\ndone in Gore. Took a quick nap, but\nreally I didn't really sleep. I was just\nkind of laying down, probably no more\nthan 20 minutes. I decided to leave. It\nwas still brutally hot, but whatever. I\njust wanted to go and kind of complete\nthe last part of the Tabernas Desert,\nbasically. Then I reached a town called\nRagul. In a sense, it was a very good\nnews because it was already in the last\npart of the of the badlands route, the\naluhara. At the same time, I remember\nvividly how the organizer had explained\nhow the alpuhara was the most difficult\nof all the badlands parts. I probably\nexperienced the toughest uh moment\nmentally of the whole Badlands journey.\nAnd I was like exhausted. I woke up at\n1:30 and like by the time I left the\nragul I was probably I don't know uh\n2000 or something like that. I was in\nlike a a chronic uh caloric deficit. Uh\nI I just I had this plan that I would\njust be wherever I am on the side of the\nstreet for a for a few hours for for a\ncouple of hours. Once I finally reached\na town called Fondon, it was already\n2200. I was obviously starving and I\nfelt I could I couldn't really go any\nlonger. So everything was closed except\na restaurant down in a in a in a camping\nsite. Once again rested for maybe two\nand a half maximum 3 hours no more\nbecause I had once again an alarm clock\nat 1:30 a.m. and it was absolutely vital\nif I wanted to reach Capilera by600 on\non the following day. Uh tomorrow no\nmatter what will be the last day. That's\nwhat I\nthought. I don't have any footage of the\nlast day because I was like only uh\nfocusing the entire time on uh you know\ngoing as fast as I could. Woke up in a\nbad mood we could say very weak. No\ncoffee once again but I had an energy\ndrink. crossed a few towns in, you know,\nin\nthe no traffic, dark, cool, but not cold\nuntil we reached Dal downhill to the\nbase of this valley where there was a\nriver and that's where the final\nmonster, the climb up to Mortas. I had\nalready been warned by some uh local\nSpanish riders I had met before that\nthis would be like after you know in the\nsecond part of the of the badlands at\nleast after the kuya do the toughest\none. I did this climb on\nlike next to zero energy levels. I mean\nI had some from the energy drinks I had\nand from like the dinner I was still\ndigesting from the night before but like\nat the muscular level I was like having\nuh butter legs really doable at the\nbeginning those steep I decided I would\nnot want to do fast at some point I lost\ncell phone signal and also GPS signal on\nmy on my Garmin and so I had a very\ndifficult time keeping on the right\nroute. the the right sleeve of my down\njacket which I had wrapped in the saddle\nbag got stuck on the rear brake and so I\nhad to cut it loose with my pocket knife\ntogether with like the part after ragle\non the day before. This was like the\nsecond hardest moment mentally or maybe\neven the hardest. Eventually, I got I\nreached Mortas at the top of this climb\nand I thought,\nuh, this was this was really the worst\nthing I've ever done as a cyclist. It\nwas the worst thing I have climbed, the\nworst possible place in the worst\npossible situation up to Mortas, up to\nthe town of Mortas, pitch dark. I was in\nthe middle of a forest with no senior.\nSo, it was kind of the worst possible\nsituation. But eventually I reached\nMortas. There was a water fountain. I\ncooled down. Um I remember meeting a\nGerman rider who said that that was a\nfantastic climb and I really thought uh\nhim and I probably didn't do the same\nroute. I mean I I really think it was\nhorrible. I mean yeah. But then I\nchecked the live\nmap on the mapping platform available\nand I noticed that the expected time of\narrival was actually pretty good. I will\nbe able to arrive with hours to spare.\nSo I kind of got really really in a good\nmood at that point particularly because\nI knew there will be no more super tough\nbeasts as the one I just completed. And\nat some point I got chased by a couple\nof dogs. They started chasing me and I\nwas kind of swearing at them and\neventually I just kind of left them\nbehind. The only good uh point was that\nuh most of the road at this point was\npaved. Not all of it obviously, but like\nmost of it was. So a lot of Dharmarmac\nin this last day. There was in all its\nevidence one major problem. the the\nalmost complete failure of my braking\nsystem at least complete failure for the\nfront part and I was relying heavily on\nthe rear one but like that's in itself\nwas like not enough particularly because\nit was quite worn too. So the bottom\nline was I could not really go fast in\nthe descents because I was not having a\nreliable break. I lost a lot of time.\nEventually, I reached Trell, which was\nlike the last town before Capilera. Uh,\nat that point, I knew I would make it in\ntime. So, I was super happy. On this\nsteep concrete ramp with no shades, my\nfront tire blew up. Uh, I had the\ntubeless tires. I don't really know why\nthey blew up, but like it just exploded\nwith like sealant\neverywhere. And uh, yeah, I mean, I had\nto stop. I tried to remain calm and\nindeed I remained calm. I could fix it\nyou know in in fact very few minutes and\nthen I was on my on my way again but at\nthe time I\nthought why now but anyway problem was\nfixed and then I I did it I was at the\nend and so I mean I couldn't believe it\nbut uh 100 meter after 100 meter\nkilometer after\nkilometer I I was like closer and closer\nto Capera. So that's when I started to\nrealize now nothing can stop me and like\nI will finish badlands and I will have\nmy medal. The risky pass which scares\nmany normally\nuh it was easy peasy. I mean after doing\nall the things I did and I mean this was\nlike almost nothing a walk in the\nparks. I completed Bedlands\n2024 and these are my impressions.\nUm the challenge was tougher way tougher\nthan I thought and talking to other\nparticipants it is a shared opinion. The\ncourse was really really technical. My\ninitial forecast on the time uh that it\nwill take me to complete collapsed after\nthe first day when I realized that uh um\nthe trail was like way slower than I\nanticipated. That means I am overly\nhappy. I am incredibly proud of having\ncompleted it. But at the same time, I\ncan totally understand and I certainly\nrespect those who uh took the brave and\nuh unavoidable decision\nto to call it off and uh and to\nwithdraw. I think like being my first\nultra cycling for me the worst part has\nbeen sleep deprivation. So uh not being\nable to sleep more than 3 hours a night\nuh in the best of the cases and riding\nfor\nlike 19 hours or so every day. Uh that\nwas probably okay but like the not being\nable to sleep uh much or at all. It was\nthe most difficult part. I had no\nproblems physically speaking. My uh legs\nmuscles were all fine. Never had a\ncramp. Obviously, my ass was in pain. I\nthink like it's unavoidable in a\ncompetition of this type and uh with\nsuch a long course. My feet were fine,\nknees were fine. The only thing that\ncaused me some uh uh I guess\ndifficulties in the last day and uh\ntoday which is like uh already two days\npast the challenge are my hands. I\nbasically lost a lot of sensibility in\nmy left hand in these three fingers\nparticularly\nand a bit uh less but still some on the\nright hand but mostly on my left hand\nand\nuh was reading a bit and it looks like\nit's something related to the obviously\ncompression of some of the nerves you\nhave on your wrist. It does not seem to\nbe a excessively serious condition, but\nit's something that it has improved\nsince the first night after the finish.\nThat was the worst, but I'm still with\nvery little sens sensitivity in the\nupper part of these three fingers. Keep\nin mind, I have a front\nsuspension. So even despite that,\ndespite I have a 3 mm bar tape and uh I\nkeep changing position on the handlebar\nto to precisely to avoid this problem, I\nstill had this. So I let you decide on\nthe implications of uh not using uh some\nsome sort of front suspension. Many\nriders were complaining about the\nexcessive heat uh on the course. Last\nyear 2023, the weather wasn't as hot as\nthis year. In the deserts, uh, Goraf and\nTiveras, the thermometer in daytime\nreached 45 with no problem. Keep in mind\nperhaps on the same day. Uh, at night\nthe temperatures were uh in some in some\nnearby mountain passes reaching 5° or\nsomething. So, a huge uh huge\ntemperature change.\nuh how I feel having completed Badlands.\nUm it was a fantastic experience is the\ntoughest thing I've ever done in my\nlife. Obviously there was a physical uh\nimpact of doing such a such a thing and\nlike it took\nme weeks to recover and uh but there was\nalso like a gigantic mental effort\nrequired during the the event and like\nthe satisfaction of being able to\nwithstand the mental pressure during\nduring the event was like incredible.\nThe best part for me was like meeting\nthe people was an experience that really\nbonds together. It's like building\nfriendship with people and like meeting\npeople who come from the most diverse\nbackgrounds and experiences and like\nthey share a lot with you in like the um\nthe level of like difficulties you go\nthrough physically and mentally and of\ncourse logistically. A lot of things can\ngo wrong. there is and there should be\nno shame in deciding to scratch and call\nit off because uh um you know you just\nmight be in a situation where it's\nreally not a good idea to go on and like\nuh I will definitely always respect such\na choice and I know that the\nmoment can come for everyone. Would I do\nbad again? No. But not because I didn't\nhave a a wonderful experience, just\nbecause I don't want the quality of my\nmemories and like the experience I did\nto kind of be diminished by by doing it\nagain. So I would rather do other\nsimilar events elsewhere\nuh and experience new adventures rather\nthan repeating the same. What is the\nbiggest thing that Badlands taught me uh\nabout myself or about things in general\nis\nthat first of all I am we are much\ntougher and stronger if we want than we\nthink we are. And so there is a large\nsocial component in like how inadequate\nwe feel nowadays about our physical and\nmental capabilities. And so it was\nreally\nuh really rewarding and uh and nice to\nbe able to see what I could accomplish.",

The route features massive early climbing with the first 300km being essentially one big climb, starting with 1,000m elevation gain in just 28km. Key challenges include a brutal 14km climb with 1,100m gain after Tabernas at mile 217, night riding at 2,000m altitude in freezing conditions, and a 3-hour rock garden climb from the coast back to the mountains. The desert section spans 80km with temperatures reaching 46°C and technical terrain with rivets that can catch wheels. Riders emphasize the inclusive ultra community atmosphere and recommend starting conservatively, carrying 35+ hours of fuel, extra electrolytes for heat, and planning 90g carbs per hour initially. The route covers dramatic landscape variety from desert to forest to coastal roads."
