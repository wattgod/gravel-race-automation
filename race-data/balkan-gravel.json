Golo's recreational touring pace averaged 68-113km daily over 8 days on longer Balkan routes, suggesting this distance allows racing hard without survival logistics. Similar distance to Crusher in the Tushar."

      "technicality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Golo describes terrain that \"offered everything from perfect asphalt to washboard to coarse gravel.\" The surface mix emphasizes grinding over technical skills - Martin Moschek's Komoot data shows 81.5km natural surface and 322km loose surface across similar Balkan routes. Less technical than The Mid South."

      "elevation": {
        "score": 3,

Similar elevation profile to Gravel Worlds."

Golo experienced \"a heavy rain shower\" and \"problematic weather\" requiring route changes during his June ride. The Slovenia/Croatia border region serves up variety - riders plan for rain contingencies and temperature swings without extreme conditions. Similar climate challenges to SBT GRVL."

        "explanation": "Golo hit \"the highest point at almost 900m altitude\" through Kozana National Park on similar regional routes. The 1180m Karaula Pass represents typical elevations - enough climbing to matter without approaching high-altitude territory. Modest altitude compared to Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."
      },
      "adventure": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Golo describes riding \"through completely uninhabited territory\" where \"before the war there were a few places of which only ruins remain - now there is only nature and lots of it.\" Cross-border racing through karstic landscapes delivers adventure beyond typical gravel fare."
      },
      "prestige": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "The field includes elite names like Leanne Bentley and Benedek Borsos, but this appears connected to the longer Trans Balkan Race rather than establishing independent prestige. Regional Balkan events are growing but lack the international recognition of established European races."

        "score": 2,

      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Tenul found locals \"very friendly\" and managed communication \"quite well without English or German\" with mountain farmers. Golo notes \"very cheap compared to EU, friendly people\" and \"surprisingly large uninhabited areas by European standards.\""
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "The regional Balkan gravel scene draws 160 riders including elite talent like Tour Divide winner Justinas Leveika and Jenny Tough. Golo describes excellent \"price/performance ratio\" with \"apartments from 18 euros upwards\" fostering an accessible community atmosphere."
      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "While elite riders like Valerio Cecchi and Jochen Böhringer participate in regional Balkan events, the specific competitive depth for this 65-mile format remains unclear. The broader Trans Balkan Race attracts international talent but over vastly different distances. Less competitive depth than Almanzo 100."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Following regional pricing at €350, this delivers solid value for cross-border European gravel racing. Golo emphasizes the economic advantage: \"very cheap compared to EU\" with quality accommodation from \"18 euros upwards\" keeping total costs reasonable."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Registration runs €50-80. International travel to Slovenia/Croatia plus cross-border logistics create the main expense burden. Elite setups like Valerio Cecchi's custom Miss Grape bags and dynamo lighting systems suggest equipment costs can escalate, though basic participation remains accessible. Higher total cost than Badlands."

everyone's the freaking\n4x4 why are we actually\nokay so\nhungry God get any\nouto I think she was a millim away from\nfully\ncracking but just about held it\ntogether but it is so un enjoyable like\nyou literally physically can't ride in\nit and it's just throwing off the bike\nand you knocking my whole body is Agony\nyeah I think I think we should\nbe very impressed I think she did\nincredible for her second ever a gravel\ntrip and uh yeah hard day out hard day I\njust wanted a\npeach do you love\ngravel love it\nme yeah it was maybe not what I expected\nto be coming up and it just felt like it\nwas getting worse and\nworse but when we popped back out again\nout the gravel road onto the tarmac and\nit was this beautiful landscape all a\nsudden all my pains and all my worries\nhave gone away why is that hit the\ntarmac Sunset looks better than my\nlenses Just Around Just Around the\nsunset oh wow that's that's the\nblurriest sunset I've ever seen\nI was such a crank I'm so glad it was\njust used to cuz I'm so embarrassed we\ncan't into the\nAlbanian Road works and that's why we\ncould have done this for the last\n70k you follow that Hill you got so many\nmore tourists\ncome's\nthat right\nlook get\nRia Bo out LED\nhey hey hey give me\nthe bye\nbye lovely\nview kn\nwhere are we\ngoing yeah capital city of Montenegro\ngot a bit of a mountain to

leave like\nno checkout time leave whenever um but\nunfortunately we have places to be so we\ngot a uh we got a ride to BOS tomorrow\nwe go out for dinner that night as usual\nfind a nice little restaurant down the\nroad don't know what came over me but\ndecided to order the The Battered\nsausage how your stomach after that meat\nfine good good\n[Laughter]\nWRA\num oop\nsee you\nmorning see you morning 10:00\nalarmia but having gone to bed all happy\nin a good mood the tone changed quite\ndramatically I could say at uh 4:00\na.m. we were abruptly woken up in the\nnight like 4:00 a.m. work food poison in\nHit Lawrence like an absolute\ntrain lying in bed that morning it hit\nme about an hour after\ntoo so at this point the sun had come\noff and we were in this tiny little town\nbasically in the middle of nowhere with\nuh no option to to get out there was no\ntrains there was no buses there was no\num really no no options and I can tell\nyou for free that we were not in a state\nto even uh walk down the street let\nalone try and get back on the bike so\nluckily Thomas was able to order us a uh\na taxi U to get us out of our sticky\nsituation hello\none that day was the hardest bike ride\nI've ever done it was only 120\n130k hands down the hardest both\nmentally and maybe even physically just\nchange of\nplan I'm riding on my own\ntoday to give you an idea of\nhow remote this route is this was the uh\nthis was the suggested route for a road\nbike one thing that certainly made the\ntax a little bit easier was knowing that\nTom was absolutely slogging himself up\nthese mountains these gravel Hills\ntrying to get through the brambles\nlittle did we know he was having an\nabsolute nightmare of a\nday this is the direct\nroute\napparently State and\nnow now I have a puncher\nhere we go\nagain I think we spoke about two words\nthe whole\ntrip yeah collapsed into the\naccomodation and that was me for the\nnext I\nthink 16 hours again after that third\npuncture stop tube has changed but the\nborder crossing I'm on the way to is\nisn't for foreigners only for locals\nfeeling a little frustrated\nbut do have to remind myself things\ncould be worse cycling through the\nsunset in monegro I can't complain too\nmuch I'd lost all my patience all my\nwill to cycle and I was like actually I\nthink I've got a little bit of the\nchicken sausage poisoning too not being\nable to eat not being able to drink\nit absolutely finished me I was\ncompletely broken by the time I finished\nthere\ntringe on the\nhorizon there glistening\nlights oh man I've been waiting to see\nthat for so\nlong holy\nBosnia I'm getting ripped on by the\nairon and I can't bothered\nmoving rained on I think everyone was\npretty weak by this point no one could\nreally turn the pedals at all but that\nlast day on paper should have been fine\nit was 40K without much climbing but\nagain horrifically hot we were all so\nweak but it's and it was just like right\nlet's get this done let's get back and\nthen we can just lie down with air\nconditioning and recuperate\nuh it it was one of those feelings that\nyou get after a long ride I guess where\nyou know you're going to finish it\nthere's no question now like I am\ndefinitely finishing this I'm so close\nto the end I can't not finish but you\njust want it to be over and like on the\nend of a lot of these bike packing trips\nI get like a bit like oh a bit sad it's\nover now like the last 20K and that I\nwas like just get this done I want to\nfinish\npedaling on that note feeling pretty\nsmug about this trip I mean I'm always\npretty smug but I feel an extra smug\nthat I'm the only one of more stories\nthe only member of more stories tomorrow\nto actually finish a lap of the Balkans\nunder my own\npower\nF made it\nTom by the skin of me teeth only just\nwe've been through a lot of bumpy\nrides we really went through some highs\nand some lows and I think some tricky\nsituations you could say and I think\nthis one was uh a really really great\ntrip and I felt like it it brought us um\nlot closer together I'm looking forward\nto to the next one I think it's you\nreally do bond together because you come\nacross\na obstacles maybe that you wouldn't\nnormally face on a normal bike ride I'm\nI'm excited to\nsee how Anna's journey into bik packing\nprogresses feels like there's been such\na change between Iceland and the Balkans\nit's really nice actually being on a\ntrip and seeing someone experience all\nthese things for the first time bringing\nback a lot of good memories for me I'm\nreally interested to see where that goes\nfor her and where it takes her which\nshould be nice agree it's almost kind of\ntaking me back to the enjoyment of\nriding a bike\nagain\nhello this trip is kind of the bike\npacking has kind of really brought that\nback to me again and um yeah basically\njust being out on a bike enjoying being\nthere with no\npurpose they doing that even get about\nit\nI will stay here for hours until them\ndogs go I not going near that thing\nfriend\nLa out",

          "transcript": "So another adventure begins.\nArrived into Ljana in Slovenia. So the\nplan is to do the Trans Dinera route\nwhich is a fairly new route which we put\ntogether\nand it goes around eight of the Bulan\ncountries. But yeah, planning to take\nabout 6 to 7 weeks to do it. It's about\n2,000 miles, but it's very, very hilly.\nAnd I can just see the mountains here\nstraight away right from the airport\nover there.\nSo, let's go. We're about seven or eight\nmiles in today. Be really, really nice\nroads on the quiet roads. They pretty\nmuch all got cycle lanes marked on them.\nSo, they've been really, really\nbrilliant. Just riding through this\nlittle town\nand uh got to drop down by the river, I\nthink.\n&gt;&gt; Well, nearly at the end of the first\nlittle day's riding.\nIt's been really lovely in the\ncountryside at the moment, but got a bit\nof a headwind to finish the day off\nwith. But okay,\nI got a couple of miles to do.\nOkay, just arrived in Scoffield Locka.\nLovely little place. And Marco here.\n&gt;&gt; Yes. Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Looking very welcoming. And he's also\ngot out some freshly produced grape and\nand\n&gt;&gt; plum\n&gt;&gt; plum juice from his garden right here.\n&gt;&gt; No. Yeah. So\n&gt;&gt; plums are from our farm between Cran and\nLjubljana. We have one farm Napoleani.\nYeah.\n&gt;&gt; Oh, there we go.\n&gt;&gt; Napoleani mean on a field.\n&gt;&gt; Oh, right. Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Here was the best field since time I\ngrow here. And this this house my\nparents made now\n&gt;&gt; 19 90 19 75.\n&gt;&gt; Oh wow.\n&gt;&gt; Now all region is more than 50 years old\nnow.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Oh, it's really green, isn't it? It's\nreally green. And and here's here's the\njuice.\n&gt;&gt; Right. Start of day two.\nBeautiful morning.\nBit cooler than yesterday. Probably\nabout low 20s already, but absolutely\nperfect. Leaving a place called Scotchia\nLocha,\nwhich uh probably hasn't been out\nproperly, but uh that's where I stayed\nlast night. Lovely little place.\nand uh heading for Tolman\nabout\n45 to 50 mi today.\nSo, I decided to take the off-road\nversion of the route. Uh it kind of\ndrops in and out of the\nthe main road down there, which was\nabsolutely lovely. Uh the off-road track\nis pretty tough,\nso I'm going to probably drop back onto\nit cuz uh I'm having to push some of the\nhills already and it's pretty pretty\nhard going. So, probably going to drop\nback onto the uh road, I think.\nOkay, things have improved a bit\noff that crazy track. Main road's just\nover there. I'm going to follow parallel\nhopefully on the quieter road.\nSo, I picked up a proper cycle route\ntrail. Really nice gravel.\nI think it goes on for several miles.\nSo, uh this is going to be fun.\nSo, the first big climb of the trip.\nIt's been a long one.\nIt's been lovely though. Beautiful road.\nMost of it was about 4%. In the last\nK and a half, it's been around 10% on\nthe switchbacks.\nSo, I guess I'm getting near the top.\nBut yeah, it's been absolutely fabulous.\nStopped for a coffee. 2/3 the way up.\nGive me a boost. I think I'm approaching\nthe top here.\nAnd now we're going to have a\nmagnificent downhill.\nIt's going to be huge. Views are\nstunning when I'm out the trees.\nWoo! Unbelievable.\n[Applause]\nOkay, this is day three. So day two was\nfantastic and then overnight massive\nthunderstorms, thunder and lightning all\nnight right over the\nthe uh the tent. So I was camping on\nthis nice little spot.\nSo picked up a nice gravel trail which\nuh is kind of following the river, but\nit's it's away from the river now. It's\nit's all up and down, up and down. and\nit suddenly turned a bit gnarly. So,\nit's going to be a bit of a hiker bike.\nThankfully, the uh rest of it so far has\nbeen lovely. Hard, but ridable.\nSo that was a pretty tough section\nup and through the mountains on an off\nroad when there was a lovely big road in\nthe valley, but this was much more fun.\nAnd the sun's actually popping out, but\nwe've got a bit of a reward now. Bit of\na downhill into the valley.\nSo I've dropped down to the uh Satcha\nRiver\nfinally. Just had a little coffee.\nJust crossing the river and there's a\ndiving platform right off the river.\nIt's pretty high. Must be pretty amazing\nto jump off there.\nWell, having crossed the river,\nbeen on the quieter roads again. Main\nroads over that side. Picked up a lovely\ncycle way. I think this goes on for\nabout another\n3 or four miles.\nAbsolutely superb.\nSo, I hadn't actually realized,\nbut I crossed over into Italy, probably\nsix or seven miles ago, and I think I'm\ngoing to cross back out in about a mile\nor so. So, yeah, it's quite fun crossing\ninto that. I'm heading for\nNovo Gicha\nwhich is about\nanother 2k.\nUh it's back in Slovenia.\nSo did a little bit in Italy. Now\ncrossing back into Slovenia.\nWell, wow.\nWhat a climb right from down the valley\nabout 40 miles in\nand uh bit of a brute anyway nearly at\nthe top.\nReally long switchbacks actually. So the\ngradients\n5 to 6% I think mostly.\nSo it's not too bad. Just potting away.\nOkay, just about to start day four of\nthis trip. I'm still in Slovenia. Stayed\nin a place called Sana last night. A\nlittle uh B&amp;B. Just had a pretty\nhumongous breakfast there actually,\nwhich is excellent. And heading into\nCroatia today, so we're going to do\nabout another 60 mi. It's 60 mi\nyesterday with about 1,400 meters of\nclimbing. Got a lot of it on gravel\nroads. So, it's quite tough yesterday,\nbut um yeah, the rain didn't come. So,\nthat was great. And it's looking pretty\ndecent today. So, we're going to head\noff and uh yeah, cross the border.\nOkay, pretty much straight out of Sana.\npicked up this lovely gravel road trail\nand it's going to go on for quite a long\nwhile looking at the map. I think it\ntakes me all the way to the Lip Designer\nStud Farm. It's a very famous stud farm.\nSo yeah, just going to enjoy the nice\ngood quality gravel gravel trail.\nWell, here it is. The Lipitana stood\nfarm. Don't know how much of it I'm\ngoing to get to see, but uh just going\nto ride past and see see what it's like.\nOkay. Well, I've just been refused entry\nto get through uh the actual\nuh main area. I can hear some music\ngoing on in the background. Um, so he\ndirected me to go around the back. So\nthat's what I'm going to do. Well, just\nskirting around the uh the Bitzana Stud\nFarm. Lovely road, too.\nYou can see the uh some of the gallops.\nOkay, I got to the caves and um there\nwas no way to get in. It was all full.\nBut my very friendly guide over here,\nwhat's her name again?\n&gt;&gt; Jiva.\n&gt;&gt; Jiva, had a little group of cyclists she\nwas taking in and she's offered to take\nme in with her, which is absolutely\nfantastic. And Shiva is actually a cycle\nguide in Slovenia.\n&gt;&gt; Okay. So,\n&gt;&gt; so we're going in now, so we better go.\nSo there's a diagram of the Scojang\nCaves. So here we are at the entrance to\nthe cave. A massive, massive group. I\nthink it's going to be split down, but\nat least we're going in.\nOkay, just done the cave tour.\nAbsolutely incredible. Not allowed to\ntake photos or they're quite strict,\nwhich is fair enough. But now I'm on the\nwalk out. Still pretty spectacular.\nAnd here's the lookout point over where\nthe river goes into the cave which\nyou've just walked out of. Absolutely\nincredible.\nSo, uh, just had a very brutal section\nof gravel\nbasically pushing up an extremely long\nhill for I don't know how long. And then\na downhill little section was only just\nridable.\nI've come out onto the road\nand it started raining,\nbut I'm going to stick to the roads now\nuh for the rest of the day.\nThe rig does take\nme onto the gravel roads, but\nI'm just not up for it now. Just going\nto do another\n40 miles on the road.\nWoo. So, I'm nearly at the top of a\nreally long big drag. Not too steep.\nLooking forward to the other side. And I\nthink this is the border with Croatia.\nIt's very low key. No one here. But kind\nof looks like a border crossing with\nsome flags. So, I guess this is it.\nAh, here's the sign.\nOh, well, I've just done a Oh, just done\na monster climb at the end of the day.\nThat's only 3 miles now. I think it's\nmostly downhill,\nbut that's finished me off. That has\nSo, the first proper view of the coast\nand I'm heading down\nto uh place called Senge, which is by\nthe beach.\nSo,\ngenerally downhill, but I know there's a\nlot of up and down between here and\nthere. So, yeah, it's looking pretty\ngood.\nWell, I've just arrived in Senge.\nGoing to have a little ride around the\nharbor. Check it all out.\nI've got a whole afternoon to chill out\ntoday. Much more civilized.\nStopped off and had an ice cream. had a\nnice cold beer actually and went to\nwhere I thought the apartments were\nand the lady said they're not here. She\nfound someone up. Spoke to another lady.\nShe said head for the cathedral. So I\nwent down all these little side roads\nside alleys. Got to the cathedral. There\nshe was. And then we've walked down some\nmore little side alleys and eventually\ngot to the apartment. It's not bad\nactually. It's up a couple of stairs in\nreally old building. So, I'm just going\nto carry my bike up and put it on the\nlanding. So, it's in here.\nOf course, it's on the second floor.\nSo, uh\nsecond flight of stairs coming up.\nOkay, just heading out of Senge on day\nsix\nand going to be following the coast a\nbit more and dropping onto a couple of\nthe islands today.\nBut some big climbs, I think. Some of\nthose hills over there.\nWell, I'm well into the first big hill\nof the day. They look pretty big on the\nprofile.\nI'm not sure how far I am up it or how\nfar to go. It's about four or 5%,\nsometimes 6%. So, it's not too bad. It's\ntaking it easy.\nSo, the biggest hill of the day is done.\nIt actually was not too bad. Pretty\nlong. Got to the top. Pulled over to\nlook at the view and there was a couple\nfrom the Netherlands sitting there\nhaving a cup of coffee with their camper\nvan.\nAnd uh they offered to give me a coffee.\nSo I sat with them for a while and had a\nchat, coffee, some cake. Absolutely\nfantastic. Really, really friendly\npeople.\nOkay, I'm just uh dropping down to the\nferry place called to prisoner\nand going across the island down there.\nIt's always good to get a ferry on these\ntrips. I think this probably going to be\nthe only one. Maybe one more.\nHere\nwe go. Think I'm the only bike.\nSo, that was the ferry. Very short ferry\nride.\nOnly about a mile and a half.\nUnfortunately for me,\nstill very nice.\nNow I've got to\ncycle along this island onto the next\nisland. I think joined by a causeway.\nSo I thought we'll have to do that.\nWoo. Okay, that's the final climb done\nof this day. I'm dropped down there.\nIt's the town of Pag\nand then out from Pag about 10 miles.\nUh then that's uh to be done today\nand heading to\nPavlejanna.\nJust crossing the courseway.\nOkay. So, uh, arrived in Pavljana\nand again, not sure if that's the right\nway to say it, but it looks like it on\nthe map. And yeah, had a good day. 63\nmiles. Um, about 1350 m of climbing.\nMore than I'd anticipated, but um,\nbasically four big climbs during the\nday. Yeah, I got a nice little apartment\nhere. Um, kind of overlooking the sea in\nthe very distance, but it's starting to\nget dark now.\nThe apartment's great. Um, had a little\nfreshen up. Got this whole apartment for\n£35, I think it was.\nThere's a nice bathroom.\nThere's actually two bedrooms, but I'm\njust in this one here.\nAnd I'm cooking up some um tuna pasta\nwith some vegetables. Um\nstandard stuff for me when I'm uh out\ntraveling if I've got the kitchen. Good\nfeed with some pasta sauce and of course\na beer.\nOkay. So I just stop for breakfast after\nabout 20 minutes. Um\nleaving Ponuljana\nand it's stopped at the supermarket.\nI've got couple of chocolate donuts,\nsome juice and some fruit.\nSo yeah, I thought I'd stop here just\nbefore I get onto the busier road. There\nis a bloody big headwind though today\nand I'm going that way all day and the\nheadwind is\nso yeah going to be a little bit tougher\nthan I thought but not too far to go\ntoday. 40 miles I think. So yeah, have\nmy breakfast and we'll crack on.\nOkay, just to prove it's not always\nsunny.\nStarted raining\nat four or five miles before the end\ntoday. Didn't quite get there in the\nsun, but just going to carry on like\nthis and uh\ncouple of miles downhill.\nI'm going to go find a\neither a campsite or a cabin. Probably a\ncabin in this weather.\nSo, the rain finally stopped. Um,\nsitting around waiting for it to stop\nbefore I put the tent up. Found a little\nspot by the river. It's pretty tight,\nbut uh it's a nice spot overall. I'm\ngoing to go for a little swim in a\nminute. And uh yeah, right next to the\nriver. Here it is.\nIt was actually the only spot left. It's\nuh near the recycling bins, which is\nokay. It's fine. It's uh it's going to\nbe quiet overnight. So, I'm only staying\nfor one night, so it it'll all be good.\nOkay, so last night was ridiculous\nthunderstorms and really really loud,\nshaking shaking my body. Uh but it\ncleared about 4 or 5 in the morning and\nthere we got beautiful sunny morning. Uh\npacking up a tent away over there\nand a very very friendly Croatian\ncouple.\nUm Borak is making me breakfast. Look at\nthis.\n&gt;&gt; This is orac\nor\nThis\n&gt;&gt; This looks incredible.\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n&gt;&gt; My husband every morning prepare me\nbreakfast and some fish\n&gt;&gt; before I go to work.\n&gt;&gt; Look at this. I'll be going fast.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. No.\n&gt;&gt; Wow. That's amazing. And some porridge\non top.\nThis is really going to set me up for\nthe day.\nWell, after that amazing breakfast by\nthose lovely people,\nback onto the road straight into a big\nclimb\nright in the mountains now. And today\ngoing to be generally\nan upwards profile back into the\nmountains.\nOkay, the first of today's gravel\nsections.\nLooking steep,\nbut all ridable.\nJust coming to the end of this little\nsection now. Back on the tarmac.\nOh, that's nice. Back on the gravel.\nThey seem to have tarmac that steep\nsection and left flatter sections.\nSo much quieter up here in the mountains\naway from the coast. It's lovely.\nDropping down into Canin\nhave some lunch.\nSo just stopped off at uh the Satina\nRiver Spring. also known as the eye of\nthe earth.\n&gt;&gt; Beautiful turquoise water.\nSo, uh, this is where I'm staying\ntonight.\nI've already checked in actually\nand just popped out to a tiny little\nsupermarket. Well, shop\nuh to get some beers. Uh it's quite the\nattraction to stay here cuz it was I\ndon't know a mile away. But look at this\nplace.\nAnd that's where I'm staying just in\nhere. Really, really lovely people.\nand they've said\nyou I can help them myself to their\ngrapes, their peppers,\nall the fruit they're growing. It's\namazing.\nSo, this is the place.\nLovely little apartment.\nGot everything in here. Bed, kitchen,\nwashing machine.\nLook at it.\n[Music]\nSo, what a stunning evening. Just had a\nwander down to the lake. Well, this is\nwhere the river Satina comes into Lake\nPeruga.\nSo, the lake just goes on round the\ncorner. I'm going to be riding along it\ntomorrow. But absolutely stunning\nevening.\nWow, this is so beautiful here.\nAway from all the crowds of yesterday\nup in the mountains\nand an absolutely beautiful little\nvillage.\nWonder down to the lake watching the\nsunset. It's absolutely stunning.\nSo everything except for the carrots\npick from the garden with the Yona's\nblessing. Absolutely amazing.\nWell, start of day nine. What a\nfantastic sleep I had last night.\nBrilliant apartment\nand uh up and ready for the monster\nclimb today to get over into uh Bosnia.\nWhat a lovely descent that was. Woo. Now\nI've got to go up again.\nOkay,\nthis is the one I've not been looking\nforward to today. Start of the big\nclimb. It's about 800 m of ascent.\njust stopped up for some food, some\ndrinks,\nand we're just going to take it nice and\nsteady up here.\nUh, probably stop a few times as well.\nOkay, I'm approaching the\nexit border for Croatia just ahead.\nnot getting near the top. I know it's\nnot actually at the top,\nbut there it is.\nSo, just crossed into Bosnia and Hzavina\nwith the passport stamped\nand still climbing up there. That's\nlooks like that's the path over there.\nHopefully around that corner.",

of\ntarmac and big heart packed gravel roads\nespecially up North so we started on the\nsouthern part the last 300 km and as it\nwould turn out Ted Slovenia had some\nbits we weren't really ready for after\nhaving been on the road for 20 hours\nwith very little sleep and\noh oh oh oh\nsorry let's move out let's move out of\nthe way we're blocking the way here wait\naore wait sorry sorry for that

especially Ural riding\non heavy and very expensive ADV\nbikes and this is Jake he's from the UK\nbut lives in Spain and he loves getting\nup early to M his Yamaha\nwr250 next we have Johannes Doan\nNorwegian Viking and on and off again\nYouTuber with a love for taking off his\nshirt and lightweight Adventure bikes\nbut his biggest love is\nfood and this is rmos and this is how he\nfrowns

any given moment where\nyou are exactly yeah in the middle of\n[&nbsp;__&nbsp;]\nnowhere next up is Sven he's from Sweden\nand his favorite sentence is don't worry\nit'll get\nworse how's the hair

YouTube channel this\ncandy\nflick it's the bad air\nshow man\nyeah and with that now let's go back to\nthe\nstory We carried on through more single\ntrack than we had expected which of\ncourse caused quite a few tumbles that\nday you okay Jake\ndown\nF hang on Stan hang on stepan hang on\nyeah do you need help Jake or are you\ngood\nW on the de we also passed the home of\nprobably a cilian bees and of course we\nhad some technical\nissues there what's going\non we have a problem with Ina's gear\nlever we had our first encounter with a\nfellow Ted\nRider sharp left and a bike and a bike\nbike bike coming bike coming bike\nbut mostly we just enjoyed the lush\ngreen scenery of Southern\nSlovenia [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I\nfend a quick glance at the GPS told us\nthat we hadn't done nearly the distance\nwe had hoped for but despite of that and\nbeing very very tired Spirits were high\nand\nunbroken right up until here\n[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] s they\nglad watch out\nja let me let me\nSC push\nyeah\nyeah s\nafter this we realized that it was\nprobably time to call it a day we were\ntoo tired we had in us through southern\nSlovenia and made not nearly as much\nprogress as we had aimed for but it was\nalready quite an\nadventure Slovenia with its smaller\nmountains is amazingly beautiful and\ngreen and Lush and the Ted here has\nplenty of challenges especially if you\nstart after having driven a car for 20\nhours\nwe found a place to sleep in the small\ntown of snika and the last thing to\ncheck off the list that day was finding\na proper\nmeal how we feeling today boys very\ngood awesome weather awesome [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]\nweather it's\nliquid the next morning we woke up to\nthunder and it wasn't from the engine\nthe forecast read rain a lot of rain in\nfact there was national weather warnings\nof severe downpours\nI thought we went to the Balkans to get\nsome sun in\n30° at the\nViewpoint and it's\n11° air\ntemperature nothing to see here\nriding in rain makes the wide\nhalf-packed gravel sections a bit\nunpleasant and quite frankly something\nthat just needs to be done with this\nallows for restlessness and time to kill\nso we played one of our favorite games\nwife swapping\nnow the wife's swapping start Johannes\nis on rasmus's bike Rasmus is on mine\nI'm on\nJohannes go\nshift the nice handle in B\nli My Bike has never been wheelied like\nthat Ros\nriding yann's ajp pr7 is quite a\ndifferent experience coming from my\ntenor 700 it's so Nimble and feels way\nlighter than the actual difference of 30\nkg riding a bike with that much more\nground clearance and better weight\ndistribution\nmakes tackling tricky tracks a walk in\npark this is so easy on this bike it's\nridiculous you can do everything on this\nbike it's so easy it's\ncheating wait a guys let me get the big\ncamera up before you go up this one\nyes maybe turn it off s s s\nwatch out watch out watch out okay get\nfree I I have the bike like this is your\nleg caught no no but but listen Johannes\nI think you need to get out of the if\nyou can can you slide down hang on S\nhang on\nS watch out for your leg\ns okay Stefan let's give Sven a little\nbit of a push here in the beginning\nuntil he gets up straight\nright up right up right up y GH\nF straight up straight\nup woo\nokay hang on guys down\nthere Sven definitely needs a break\nI still suck at this but a little bit\nless than in the last movie that was\nabout a big adventure in TV then which\nyou can find somewhere here will I get\npaid\nnow like share and\nsubscribe am I am I treating your big\nblack stallion yeah yeah it's the best\nwife wife SW she's ever had yeah\nwheelies Helm\nclimbs once you get the Rasmus she don't\nwant to get you\nback can you give us a little recap you\nhandses where are we I have absolutely\nno freaking clue somewhere between\nSlovenia and\nGreece I think Croatia is like that way\nbut uh it could be that way could be\nthat way following the track\nhey cardo radio off radio off I don't\nknow why it turned on the radio uh just\ngive give us a heads up let's be\nreasonable if it's too tricky we'll\nrather turn around and and circle back\nphone connected oh\nare you stuck\nJake you couldn't break Jake okay so\ndefinitely just one at the time\nhere I don't want to be ramped by\nJake okay so continue straight don't try\nto stop is that what you're saying yeah\nhe\noh I'm still\nstanding we're going this\nway it's really slip slippery at the\nbottom Jake\nand I'm I'm still in the way so don't go\nyet I'm going to go down there and turn\naround oh good job Jake oh good job\noh nice\nsave good job Jake nice\nbigger roads in the rain is a bit boring\nand tiresome oh but small and steep\nsingle trap like this becomes five times\nmore challenging than when riding it\ndry this doesn't look very steep on\ncamera but take my word for it it felt\nthree times steeper than it actually\nlooks the m is no problem\nespecially when the muddy clay like\nsurface has about the same amount of\ngrip as pure\nice there yeah yeah yeah\nwo F\nHall shut\nup\nVal this\ntricky yeah yeah\neventually though we did make it down to\nthe bank of the river that separates\nSlovenia from\nCroatia and here we found an amazing and\nmuch needed good lunch\nwe are in\nCroatia it took a little longer than we\nexpected we we started yeah exactly we\nstarted\nyesterday at 1:00 and we've driven 276\nkm and it's now 5:30 the day after yeah\nSlovenia could now be crossed off our\nlist we started in Lark just south of\nthe capital\nyuana and we inched our way through\nCroatia and that little penis-like shape\nhere at the bottom had taken us almost 3\nhours because of the\nrain but we were now across the border\nand at the first most northern Loop of\nTed\nCroatia where I asked the boys to pose\nfor a bit of\nBoll\nidiots give you one gave you one single\nthing to do for this film stand over\n[Laughter]\ntake just\nkidding the northern Loop is basically a\nfull Tac section it takes you across the\ndam at Lake lovasco it offers some great\nnews but we finished it in 30 minutes\nand continued on the main Ted Line and\nour first bit of Croatian gravel\nit's so weird we we're so close to\nSlovenia but still this tracks the\ntracks are completely\ndifferent I mean it must be one or two\nmountains since we were in Slovenia but\nit's just\ndifferent different surface of the roads\nalso more\nRocky after having ridden for nearly 12\nhours we were now very close to the\ncatian coastline in fact the closest the\nT goes towards the adri SE and we\ndecided to stop to find a place where we\ncould stay for the night that's\nnice how's the mood Johannes couldn't be\nbetter a bit tired\nI'm here with my best friends and

Key challenges include a frightening tunnel section that riders warn about, and mountain terrain where mechanical issues can separate groups and cause significant delays. The northern Slovenia sections feature hard packed gravel roads and tarmac, while southern areas contain unexpected challenging terrain. The route climbs out of the Bay of Kotor and passes through dramatically changing landscapes from bustling areas to remote farmland. Weather conditions have been described as perfect despite expectations of horrible weather, though the heat presents a significant challenge for riders tackling this demanding course through the breathtaking but unforgiving Balkan mountains."
