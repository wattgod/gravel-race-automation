      },
      "length": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "At 65 miles, this sits in the sweet spot for a day race rather than the region's multi-day epics. Golo's recreational touring pace averaged 68-113km daily over 8 days on longer Balkan routes, suggesting this distance allows racing hard without survival logistics."
      },
      "technicality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Golo describes terrain that \"offered everything from perfect asphalt to washboard to coarse gravel.\" The surface mix emphasizes grinding over technical skills - Martin Moschek's Komoot data shows 81.5km natural surface and 322km loose surface across similar Balkan routes."
      },
      "elevation": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "4500 feet across 65 miles delivers solid climbing without the sadistic ratios of longer Balkan events. Martin Moschek notes regional routes average \"2,000 metres of elevation gain per 100 km\" - this falls well below that punishing standard while still separating climbers."
      },
      "climate": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Golo experienced \"a heavy rain shower\" and \"problematic weather\" requiring route changes during his June ride. The Slovenia/Croatia border region serves up variety - riders plan for rain contingencies and temperature swings without extreme conditions."
      },
      "altitude": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Golo hit \"the highest point at almost 900m altitude\" through Kozana National Park on similar regional routes. The 1180m Karaula Pass represents typical elevations - enough climbing to matter without approaching high-altitude territory."
      },
      "adventure": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Golo describes riding \"through completely uninhabited territory\" where \"before the war there were a few places of which only ruins remain - now there is only nature and lots of it.\" Cross-border racing through karstic landscapes delivers adventure beyond typical gravel fare."
      },
      "prestige": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "The field includes elite names like Leanne Bentley and Benedek Borsos, but this appears connected to the longer Trans Balkan Race rather than establishing independent prestige. Regional Balkan events are growing but lack the international recognition of established European races."
      },
      "race_quality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "With 160 riders signed up for related regional events, there's organizational infrastructure, but specific details for this 65-mile format remain unclear. The longer Trans Balkan Race provides proven course management through challenging terrain."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Tenul found locals \"very friendly\" and managed communication \"quite well without English or German\" with mountain farmers. Golo notes \"very cheap compared to EU, friendly people\" and \"surprisingly large uninhabited areas by European standards.\""
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "The regional Balkan gravel scene draws 160 riders including elite talent like Tour Divide winner Justinas Leveika and Jenny Tough. Golo describes excellent \"price/performance ratio\" with \"apartments from 18 euros upwards\" fostering an accessible community atmosphere."
      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "While elite riders like Valerio Cecchi and Jochen Böhringer participate in regional Balkan events, the specific competitive depth for this 65-mile format remains unclear. The broader Trans Balkan Race attracts international talent but over vastly different distances."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Following regional pricing at €350, this delivers solid value for cross-border European gravel racing. Golo emphasizes the economic advantage: \"very cheap compared to EU\" with quality accommodation from \"18 euros upwards\" keeping total costs reasonable."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "International travel to Slovenia/Croatia plus cross-border logistics create the main expense burden. Elite setups like Valerio Cecchi's custom Miss Grape bags and dynamo lighting systems suggest equipment costs can escalate, though basic participation remains accessible."
