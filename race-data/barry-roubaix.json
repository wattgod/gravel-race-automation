        "explanation": "Mostly fast, well-graded county gravel roads. One mile of rough two-track (Sager Road) with sand and ruts is the only true technical test. If it's wet, the 'peanut butter' mud adds difficulty but it's still rideable."

        "explanation": "Billed as 'the world's largest gravel race' since 2014. That claim is legit—no other gravel race fields 5,500. It's a Midwest institution and early-season benchmark, but lacks the gravitas of Unbound or SBT GRVL."

It's not the hardest course or the most prestigious field, but the combination of 5,500 riders, Michigan spring weather roulette, and genuine small-town hospitality creates something unique. It's the early-season gut check that sets the tone for your gravel year.",
