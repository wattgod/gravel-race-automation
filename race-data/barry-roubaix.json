But let's be honest - it's a Midwestern spring opener, not Unbound. The field size creates buzz, but pros like Pete Stetina treat the 62-mile 'Killer' as a 'relative sprint' compared to summer ultras."
      },
      "race_quality": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Solid organization for moving 5,500 bodies through rural Michigan, but the mass start creates chaos at bottlenecks like Sager Trail where 'only eight of us remained' in the front group. The new uphill finish adds a decent sting - 0.25 miles at 6% after 100 miles isn't nothing. Race runs smooth until weather turns it into a survival fest."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "70 kegs of Founders Brewery and a festival atmosphere make for a proper post-race celebration. The infamous Sager Road section gives everyone a war story to tell. But when 42% of the field DNFs in bad weather like 2017, you're getting more survival than celebration for many riders."
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Nothing bonds cyclists like shared suffering through Michigan spring weather - the 2011 edition with 25°F starts and 10°F windchill created a brotherhood of the hardcore. Youth race free, no license required, and the beer flows freely afterward. But with 5,500 riders, you're more likely to bond with strangers than find your crew."
      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "It's a season opener that draws weekend warriors emerging from trainer dungeons more than peak-season pros. The 100-mile field caps at 400, so the sharp end gets diluted across four distance options. Early season fitness means heavy legs and rusty bike handling - not exactly a recipe for elite racing depth."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "$119 for 100 miles with $40k in total prize money and a massive post-race party is fair market rate. Youth race free, which is decent. But you're paying season-opener prices for what might turn into a frozen death march if Michigan weather decides to remind you it's still winter."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Hastings, Michigan won't break your budget for hotels and food like a destination race. Registration opens in November and sells out fast, so no last-minute discounts. Factor in cold weather gear because April in Michigan can still hit you with 25°F starts and potential snowstorms like 2013."
      },
      "length": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Four distance options from 18 to 100 miles means everyone finds their suffering sweet spot. The 100-mile 'Psycho Killer' with 7,000+ feet of climbing earns its name. Even the 36-mile 'Thriller' packs enough punch to challenge early season fitness coming off winter trainer sessions."
      },
      "technicality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Mostly fast rolling gravel roads with one mile of rough two-track at Sager Road that everyone talks about afterward. The sandy, rock-strewn Sager section and 'Three Sisters' climbs provide the only real technical challenges. It's 80% gravel county roads that 'ride like road... until they don't.'"
      },
      "elevation": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Rolling hills that never let you rest but never really hurt either - 'one never climbs more than a minute, but you're rarely on flat roads.' The Three Sisters early on can drop you in 5 minutes if conditions turn to 'peanut butter mud,' but max grades only hit 6-8%. It's death by a thousand cuts, not Alpine suffering."
      },
      "climate": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Michigan spring weather is a dice roll between snowstorms and freak 70°F heat waves. The 2017 edition saw 42% DNF rates from cold rain and 18+ mph winds, while 2016 turned into a dusty road race. 2011's 25°F start with 10°F windchill separated the hardcore from the smart."
      },
      "altitude": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "It's Michigan. You're racing at corn field elevation where the biggest altitude challenge is climbing onto your roof rack. Zero altitude considerations unless you count the brief oxygen debt from laughing at this question."
      },
      "logistics": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Moving 5,500 riders through rural Barry County without major disasters is impressive enough. Start/finish in downtown Hastings works well, and the post-race setup with 70 kegs suggests they know how to handle crowds. But early season timing means unpredictable weather can turn logistics into chaos management fast."
      },
      "adventure": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Michigan spring weather guarantees you won't know what you're getting until race morning - could be snow, mud, dust, or ice. Sager Trail's sandy two-track through the woods adds genuine adventure to otherwise predictable gravel roads. The real adventure is whether your winter training actually prepared you for this early season reality check."
