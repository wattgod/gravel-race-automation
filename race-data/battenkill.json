Similar distance to Crusher in the Tushar."

        "explanation": "Mixed surfaces require bike handling skills, but Washington County gravel is generally smooth and hard-packed.

Early May in upstate New York delivers unpredictable conditions. The 2025 race earned \"flahute\" status when CJ Rudy found \"it had been raining all week\" before race day. Spring weather swings from perfect to miserable - \"it was cool enough to play havoc on attire\" as rain stopped mid-race, creating dramatic temperature changes. More weather exposure than Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

        "score": 1,

        "explanation": "You're riding the resurrected 'Queen of the Classics' through covered bridges and scenic hamlets in the Battenkill Valley. The primitive routes and potential for epic mud battles add adventure beyond just another gravel grind. It's not exotic, but there's real character in these Washington County back roads that money can't manufacture."

The 2025 resurrection by Anthem Sports brought back the legend after seven-year dormancy.

Organization includes extensive volunteer coverage and emergency presence. Despite 2025's brutal mud conditions, riders still found it \"an absolute joy to complete\" - the suffering comes from the terrain, not poor planning."

The race is rebuilding elite concentration after seven-year absence from the calendar. Less competitive depth than Almanzo 100.

          "transcript": "not so long ago i took part in my first\never gravel race and absolutely loved it\nbut after having some time to reflect i\nhave learned quite a few things and a\nfew tips that if i'd have known before\nthe race would have definitely helped me\nso in this video i'm going to share them\nwith you let's go\n[Music]\nfirst up tires and tire pressure for\nanybody doing their first gravel event i\nwould definitely recommend doing some\nresearch into the course i was lucky\nenough to be able to go down and ride\nthe course the day before so i had a\ngood idea of what kind of tires i was\ngoing to need my race had a lot of\ncompact gravel and sand so i knew these\nwider slicker tires were going to be\nperfect for the job instead of the\nnarrower knobblier tires but if you\ncan't get to the course and ride it the\nday before you can always look at all\npictures from the race or maybe a video\nor take a quick look on maps or commute\nnext up tire pressure i went with 30 psi\nfor the race and not gonna lie that\nsounds like absolutely nothing to me\ncoming from a track cycling background\nwhere we pump our tires up to 200 psi\nbut i actually think i could have gone a\ntiny bit less pressure because on the\ngrassier sections of the course it was\npretty bumpy and all those vibrations\ngoing through my hands and my arms i\nthink i'm just a bit too soft so make\nsure you do your research on the course\nand make the right call on tire choice\nbecause once the race starts you can't\nchange your tires or put more air in\nthem you probably take some air out but\nthat requires stopping and you don't\nwant to stop\nnext up is bike choice now the very kind\npeople at kona sent me two bikes to\nchoose from the rove and the libra some\nof you guys that ride off-road might be\nfamiliar with the kona as they are\npretty big in the mountain bike world\nand know a thing or two about making\noff-road bikes\nit was quite a tough decision to choose\nbetween these very beautiful gravel\nbikes but it ultimately came down to the\nhandlebars so on the libra there are a\npretty wide set of handlebars which are\ngreat for the technical sections of the\ncourse there wasn't that many techie\nbits on the course i was racing on so i\nwent for the rove which had a slightly\nnarrower handlebars which were great for\nthe fast terrain i was faced with the\nrove also has flared handlebars\nsomething you often see on gravel bikes\nbut i've never actually used the flared\nbars before but i was very impressed it\ngave a very relaxed feel when riding on\nthe faster fire roads\ni did run slightly different\nmeasurements on this bike than i\nnormally would on my road bike i came\nhigher with the handlebars and a shorter\nstem this was because it's a lot more\ncomfortable position to be in when\nspending a long time on the really bumpy\ngravel sections where there's a lot of\nvibrations going through your hands and\na lot of pressure and it's also a little\nbit better for handling\ni had big plans to be well field for\nthis race i took plenty of gels and food\nin my back pocket\nhow much do they eat\nyeah just just the one gel i was\nconstantly thinking in the race man you\nneed to eat you need to drink\nbut when you're hanging on to wheels\ngoing over seriously bumpy terrain\nand you've had you're going so hard in\nthe race you feel a little bit sick from\nthe effort the last thing i wanted to do\nwas eat\nand yeah i seriously did pay for it in\nthe last lap of the race\ni hadn't been training anywhere near\nenough for this race so i knew i had to\nbe wildfield to do well and get round in\nthe race and it does sound easy oh just\nyou know in the race just have a gel or\nhave a bath but when you're hanging on\nto the wheels your heart rate is sky\nhigh\nit's not so easy but it is something i'm\ndefinitely going to practice for next\ntime i come to do a gravel race because\nin my case the race was only 70\nkilometers\ngod help me if the race was 170\nkilometers and i wasn't filled i'd\nprobably still be out there\nmy gravel race was on laps of 23\nkilometers but a lot of events can be\ndone from point to point now this hadn't\neven crossed my mind but when i got to\nthe start most people had spares in\ntheir back pockets or in a saddlebag\nthis is definitely something i'm going\nto do next time because i don't want to\nbe that person stuck out there with a\npuncture with no spares and have to do\nthe walker shame back to the race hq\nthat's all you need to take is some\nbasic spares a mini pump a tube and some\ntyre levers it might cost you the win\nhaving to stop but at least you'll get\nto the finish\nturns out gravel races they start pretty\nrapidly and i probably wasn't as\nprepared as i could have been i had a\nlittle ride round beforehand i think it\nwas five ten minutes of riding around\nlistening the legs off but i would\ndefinitely recommend doing a little bit\nmore than i did going out for 15 20\nminutes doing some warm-up activation\nefforts so you get to that start line\nand you're prepared for a fast start and\ngive yourself the best possible chance\nso they are some of the things i learned\nfrom doing my first ever gravel race if\nyou're looking to enter your first\ngravel race make sure to take those\nthings into consideration so you don't\nmake the same mistakes i did and if you\ndid enjoy this video make sure to give\nit a big thumbs up",

delr I'm the\ndirector of the amanii project and team\namanii I'm Josh Reed I'm a global giant\nAmbassador we're heading to the Masai\nMara for a 4-day stage race called the\nmigration gravel race you just feel like\nyou're somewhere really special 650 km\nroughly 8,000 M of climbing I'm\ncurrently riding on a new giant Revolt\nwhich is yet to be released by the time\nthis video is out it should be it should\nbe out\nthere uh my name is Vincent Che and uh\nthis is where I live this is my\nhome I'm feeling good I'm feeling really\ngood mentally that is the best thing so\nmentally I'm really in a good place and\nuh physically my body is is well and\nfeeling strong and looking forward to\nthe start I think the flooding we had uh\nbefore the race was um not beneficial\nfor the conditions of the track it's the\nkind of race that's like after Finish\nLine you never want to come back and\nyou're even inside the race maybe even\nangry at organizes but then you at home\nand next week you just want to enter\nagain like this kind of races that you\nthat you remembered for the rest of your\nlife the most people are the people who\nstill have their own culture and the\npeople who still believe in nature\nI'm used to Ultras and sleeping in a\nbush so this is\nluxury five star accommodation yeah we\nhad a great period together and um yeah\nI enjoyed that bit until last 2 3 hours\nit was just a gradual degradation to\nAbsolute kind of Destruction started\nseeing our helicopters up in the air\nit's just checking the route clearing it\nmake sure there's no animals out there\nsun is out yeah hopefully there's no out\nthere it's the fastest man who can get\nan ed out in the world in the gravel\nscene today I'm expecting to get round\nyou know I need to wait for somebody\nwith about 40K to go cuz there's a\nmassive headwind so whoever that is who\nI find not me because I'm too small no\nyou're going to be way ahead of me man\nyou can breathe at this altitude I can't\nmy the last video was proof of that you\nknow mate what a video that's hilarious\nyou caught that video you caught me you\ncaught me decking it in 4k\n4K you better be in front of me so you\ndon't catch any more of me crashing I am\nfeeling good I'm impressed with the\nediting skills yeah like like Elliot\nsaid yeah no it's going to be fun out\nthere fast fast and short I mean you\nhave to enjoy the shorter stage this\nyear you going to win again I go for it\nhow you feeling Joel good ready yes I'm\nI'm ready to race I wish I felt this\nexcited before every race nice to be\nback in tomorrow nice to be back yeah I\nlike do and I don't want to see an\nelephant cuz I just think they're so\ncool but I'm also really scared of them\nnow for the first time in my life a warm\nup before the\nrace uh we see this work or not know\nit's the first stage people are quite\nfresh\nstart of the migration grel\nrace lit massively\nalready the migration gravel race is a\n4-day stage race across the Masai Mara\n650 km 8,000\n[Applause]\nM how you feeling about the mud oh so\ngood I kind of like it it's like\ngrassy like\ngirl so many people have had two bigger\ntires\non need the clearance\nand I'm so glad I've got 45 Ms and\nplenty of clearance on the\nRevolt 120k in and we've hit our first\npaveed Road\nhow was your day she know what it was\nall right I got electrocuted I got stuck\nin mud for a while what else happened\ntoday yeah just quite a lot to be honest\nit was fun though is came third which is\nprobably what I wanted for day one want\nto take it Ste work my way up um third\nposition than last year yeah I came\nfourth from day one last year and second\noverall so maybe I'll move up another\ntwo positions no I don't think so um but\nyeah everything's playful now we've got\nto eat recover relax and do it all again\nanother three days in a row how was your\nday Chad oh it was a hard day hard hard\nday went over the bars and an early\nCreek Crossing and then uh my jumbo\ntires did not work well with the mud um\nI passed you and then you came roaring\npast me yeah once once I got the mud\ncleared I was good to go but then I just\ndidn't have the fight in me today to\nchase all the way back so it was just a\nlong day well there's three more days\nthere are a few more days yeah why don't\nyou gretto the the next two and then the\nlast day go for it hey it's worked\nbefore give it another try\nhuh this one to\nyou faster makes you faster\nP makes you faster did you not know\nthat\nyeah how was it today very very hard\nyeah I I was doing it with\nRob uh I'm here with so I stayed with\nhim till off yeah it was just I couldn't\neven imagine what it be like racing the\nfront to be honest with you CU it was\njust like a much better mountain bike\nlike that did you get stuck in the mud\noh completely oh yeah was Full Stop\nSticks clearing gears All That Jazz and\nthen yeah then towards then I splid off\nand did the leopard just went hard the\nsecond half and kind of had some fun but\neven then it was like how are your arms\nyeah they were tired I mean everything I\nhave to say it was kind of\npsychologically starting to crack me the\nthe constant Relentless bumping towards\nthe end I've ever experienced I was like\nit would be my kingdom for a s full\nsuspension bike at that point like are\nyou glad riding in Africa didn't get to\nappreciate it much to be honest today\neven at the holes too much yeah it was\nlike you have to concentrate so much and\nthen that first like 20ks was just\nSavage so you\nknow yeah it wasn't\nquite the holiday experience I was\nhoping the Safari experience I was\nhoping for\nI would say that is approximately 200\ncalories of peanut butter right\nthere that would be my analysis of the\nsituation what have you got for\nbreakfast I've made a specialty which I\nlike to call weer porridge it mixed we B\nwith glute and it's kind of made\nsomething mly edible and I've squished\nsome banana in for some\nflavor carbohydrates feel like this is\nround two of last year isn't it I was\nsitting there eating a sweet potato\nsandwich at this exact\nCamp what do you remember from the rout\nfrom last year I just remember there\nbeing an incredible single track descent\nwhich I've been told isn't so incredible\nthis year which is sad um lots of\nclimbing was a really long\nday hoping it's less long I think it\nwill be more\nlong you're currently on third how much\ntime you got to make up I'm 4 and a half\nminutes off second 6 minutes off first\nwhich is not that much time considering\nI thought it was like 15 minutes\nyesterday and I wasn't really overly\npushing myself um so we'll\nsee J how you feeling good yeah I slept\nwell ready for a day ready to rock and\nroll\nyeah coming from road racing everything\nis uh is done for you so it's quite a\nbig difference but it's pretty pretty\nfun I have to be I have to say what's\nyour plan for\ntoday actually I don't know the the full\nresult because I didn't have any uh\ninternet connection yesterday so just\ntry to do like yesterday see what\nhappens during the day race as as hard\nas we can and try to be in the front\nagain we know that the river crossing\ntoday generally in the past it's been\nvery shallow and just a little river but\ntoday might be a bit different so we'll\nsee what happens M you ready for the\nqueen stage yeah I'm so ready to be\nQueen of the queen stage Tri that would\nbe quite cool would\nbe all right it's going to be hard it's\ngoing to be a long day out\nenjoy it's 166 km with\n2,717 M of climbing when we get to where\nSimon will be he'll be on the motorbike\nand he will then be on the side and he\nwill open up the\nrace it is then about 10 km down gently\ndownhill to a road where you will turn\nleft that section there as you know\nKenyon roads expect the unexpected bear\nthat in mind those of you up front who\nare pushing it take it easy you will\nstart to climb from about uh uh 45 km\nand you're starting to climb right up\ninto the loiter Hills and you're going\nto reach the high point of nearly 3,000\nM tomorrow when you get up on top of the\nhills and then you start to descend\nthere is a technical single track that\nused to be really amazing and flowing it\nwill get back to that the more people\nthat use it but at the minutes please\nbear note that it is technical so just\ncheck yourself if you're not feeling\nconfidence start of stage two for the\nmigration gravel race been so bumpy I\ncouldn't get my camera out I settled\ninto a group\nand yeah Queen stag in the climbing day\nup yeah you good you're good okay yeah\nlovely and smooth yeah the gravel has\nsmoothed off we're no longer on the the\nbumpy tracks and we're going up the the\nbiggest climb of the\nday and heading up to about 3,000 M I\nthink feeling good better than the as\nwhat you think of that raw Bellow stuff\noh it's so good nice and natural not too\nsugary love\nit you know you know there aren't many\nopportunities where we can still go out\nand test ourselves in this sort of\nman-made world and we' like to think\nthat with this event um you can go out\nand you can see What You're Made Of\nright you can ride and and experience\nLandscapes that are increasingly\nVanishing um experience you know\ncultures that you may never encounter um\nand at the same time yeah have a hell of\na

no\nguard rails there are no\nfences um you're you're in it amongst\nthe the animals and amongst the elements\nbut\nthankfully uh we belong to the same\nspecies as the Massi and the Massi have\na bit of a reputation in this these\nparts and so the animals tend to steer\nclear of us uh because of our cousins\nthe\nMassa and the M People also are really\nspiritual people of which are the\nAfrican believes African spiritual\nbeliever they believes in angai angai is\nour God and they believe also in nature\nyes what what is special with nature for\nthe Masai people uh what is special\nactually we believe water water is alive\nfor everyone and also we believe uh some\nspiritual uh some holy trees like um\nOlive and a family of SE tree which is\nwe call or so that's why it special and\nalso uh nature Feed Us everything give\nus more informations and uh uh you can't\nlive without nature because we are we\nare from nature\noh it's so\ngood relaxing\nw a\nliving my best life\nhere over half

a\nlittle bit just from our racing fix and\nnow sat up so I can make a a better\nvideo and enjoy the day a bit\nmore everyone's hurting a little bit\neveryone was looking a bit bit draggled\nat the start this\nmorning\nbut I'm looking forward to another day\nriding my giant revolt\nfor\nreally nice\nsuper you enjoy\nthe I just had a burp we just had some\nof the\nnicest smooth twisty single track uh\nthat we've had yet and it was worth it\nsuper nice following Sarah\ndown good whe to\nfollow there you go\nhe\nfive more CLS to do today we've done\n1,370 M which means we've got about 600\nto go so the day is going\nfaster than the last two\nhave we're now going uphill to a bit of\na cross\nhead bit of a slog but we're getting\nthere\nthis CL through the last speed so got\n30k to go still to get over of how tasty\nthat pineapple\nis feel\ngreat uh I\nthink kind of\nremembering when I used to race the pro\nmy third day in St races BR R start\ngood years old\nfeel great nice\nactually too swing I just\nbeing part of a race what's\nhappening you\ndo bunch of\nBritish following\ncar I'm pretty sure they're aus\nhow did your St\ngo pretty good\nbut H Lucas and Dan is crazy in the\ndownhill I I don't try to follow these\nguys uh but yeah I have a 9 Minutes in\ngeneral classification now and we see\ntomorrow I hope pleas not take technical\ntomorrow maybe like a big\nroad uh we see maybe answer is angry\ntomorrow what do you think of the the\nrace so far have you been enjoying it\nyeah it's been like brutally hard to be\nhonest um Lucas told me it's a really\nnice race to do as a mountain biker and\nso far it's true but you wish you had a\nmountain bike at some point yes for sure\nno I think rukas told me it was more\nrough than last year from from the\nfloods the roads are in worst worst\nconditions but yeah it's it's the kind\nof race that's like after the Finish\nangry at the organizers but then you at\nhome and next week you just want to\nenter again it's like this kind of races\nthat you that you remembered for the\nrest of your life they say tomor all\ndownhill that's what we like so of\ncourse if I can try we we try to to win\nit and we'll be will be a nice battle I\nguess before I come to this race I've\nbeen asking for the people who did this\nrace and it was telling me it's very\nhard one very challenging but it's\nbeautiful and that's exactly what I\nfound actually it's really nice it's\nvery challenging but in good way I I\nreally like it it's uh the roads is uh\nbeen like has\neverything crossing rivers it's uh small\ntrucks mountains big roads smoo pampy\nroads everything has it so like it's\nit's good if it's it's a good experience\nas a grael rider I would say so coming\nfrom the world tour and having\neverything C for you to then coming to a\nstage race where you're sleeping in a\ntent having a shower with a bucket and\n[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] in a hole how's how is the how\nwas the difference there I mean you\nexpect to do that you know like when you\nare in Kenya that's something that\npeople enjoying it and that some people\nthat expecting to do coming in Kenya and\nimmigration and do those experience\nreally and I really love it because to\ntell you honestly it was my first time\nsleeping in the end in my life and I\nreally like it because there's always\nstarting point and it's here I did it\nand it's nice uh and it's different\nexperience I would say it's it's it's\nbeautiful it's a it's something that\nother gra uh races that you cannot found\nthis experience I would say and on the\nroads when you ride sometimes like when\nthe zebra and the anant they when they\nrun like the run away when we come like\nI don't even look them because I'm\nracing but I wish that I'm a I'm like a\na m Rider or just sit and picture you\nknow like it's just that kind of moment\nI wanted that it's it's people is I\nbelieve is really enjoying it to do that\nyou know this is my first time ever in\nAfrica first race ever in uh Kenya and\nmigration gravel race is a beautiful\nevent I'm here with two two great\nmountain bikers Lucas B and H becking uh\nspent the week in E10 before where they\ntaught me the ropes a bit of handling a\nbike uh downhill on uh off-road roads\nand uh the race is actually quite quite\nepic the scene are amazing you see crazy\nWildlife that uh that we don't see in\nBelgium so it's pretty pretty amazing\nbut you don't get elephants in Belgium I\ndon't have any elephants in my garden\nnor nor giraffes or uh Wilder Bas so\nit's pretty pretty amazing to see all\nthis while while you're racing and uh\nit's quite a unique experience and I'm\nvery happy to be here so last year we\ndid\nmigration is it harder this year\ndefinitely um the stages are more or\nless similar in profile but um\nI think the flooding we had uh before\nthe race was um not beneficial for the\nconditions of the track he can really\nsee like the roads are washed out it's\nnot fast rolling as it was last year um\nin comparison I think the first\nstage uh was quite identical and um it\ntook them half an hour or I think 40\nminutes more than than me last year and\nI was yeah with with Lan alone and they\nhad a group of three so yeah it just\njust slower overall makes it more hard\non your body more hard on the on the\nbikes um because of the flooding just of\nof the flooding today I was\n[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] what how much do you lose today I\nthink I lost uh like an\nhour pretty rough yeah yeah was\nterrible it's not like the hardest\nStitch but it just went bad yeah went\nbang it went Bang\nyou're still ahead of us yeah but that's\nnot yeah yeah yeah but it's either you\ngo hard or go home so I'm still happy\nwith the way the the other days have\ngone and looking forward to tomorrow\neverything is still uh possible yeah if\neveryone has like a puncture and like\nyeah yeah yeah\nthis is called\nluxury what luxury it's a five star\nbreakfast this don't even know what I'm\neating but it's\nbrown breakfast every morning have we\nit's the last one guys it's the last day\nI did not sleep last night I don't know\nwhy I was cold and I woke up with a\nrunny nose but you know what it's only\n100 miles to go and I woke up and I was\nlike it's fine it's just downhill it's\nnot that far it's 160\nkm but I've got 40 minutes on four 7\nminutes on second but I don't think\nwe're thinking in that direction I think\nwe're thinking hold third\nhow we doing back at the front of the\nrace again Tony took me like 3 days to\nget here\nstart of the last day of the migration\ngravel race we've been told the\nambulance up ahead seen two cheaters so\nkeeping my eyes\npeeled enjoying the last day of riding\nin the M\nMara it's pretty beautiful out\nhere I respect the commit in\nthe feel pretty good as well\nyeah most of the time I'm breathing out\nmy arm the most injured rider most\ninjured rider that's still going anyway\nreally is for the content man it's so\nimpressive\nare you going to go for the solo win now\nyeah I think so yeah I don't think I'm\nthat far behind dude honestly you're\nonly about 20 minutes dude it'll be\nquick man I tell\nyou I think Lucas Pal's on a bad day so\nI think they about go hard now yeah\nthere a slim chance dude Hans and Lucas\nlook like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] form right now it's time\nhow's it all right I think I was going\ntoo fast and then trying to catch up to\na group on the Rocks yeah\nsh\nI think we're going to put\nover the last 4 days it's been a bit of\na\ntradition for me to remind you where you\nare does anyone know what this river is\nbehind\nusar Kamar\nRiver invite everyone just to take a\nmoment to\nlisten it's peaceful\nno would you believe that this River in\na few weeks\ntime will be the source and the scene of\nextraordinary\nviolence this is where a million Wilder\nbeasts will cross\nto an uncertain\nfuture and that is sort of the Paradox\nof the marrow right it can be peaceful\nand it can be\nbrutal all of you 4 days\nago embarked on a\njourney you subjected yourselves to the\nelement at times it was beautiful\nand at times it was\nbrutal some of you may have had\nquestions running through your\nminds maybe some of you have never\nreally faced\ndown that type of adversity\n[Laughter]\ncongratulations thank\nyou show the people\nfinally what is your goal with the\nammani project and the migration gravel\nrace was an outcome\nyeah so the goal of this race\nessentially is to bring world class\nracing to Kenya I I think um bike racing\ndoesn't necessarily have to happen in\nEurope and if it only happens in Europe\nit limits the access for other athletes\nto be able to participate so we're\ntrying to bring um yeah world class\ncompetition world class uh stature to to\nKenya so that athletes from the region\nand from the continent can access and\ncompete against the best of the world at\nthe same time it it acts as a revenue\nstream to teamman which is a team of\nEast African athletes that we send\nacross the planet to go and race in some\nof the biggest gravel races and show\nwith opportunity what East African\nathletes can do um we've seen them\nfighting in Europe we see them fighting\nin the United States uh we're not here\nto take inclusivity boxes we're not just\nshowing up uh we came to race uh and\nshow the world what we can do and kick\nass and kick\nass he's just doing his yoga\nactiv oh my guys I'm going to pass away\nif I see\nthis G it a go oh my God right which\nwill Beast is the\nslowest they're not fully
