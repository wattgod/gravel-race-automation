      "length": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Dawn Andone notes 'riders usually complete the course in six hours' for the 50-mile distance. Multiple options exist (10, 35, and 45 miles), but the featured distance hits that recreational middle ground between quick ride and epic challenge."

        "score": 2,

      "adventure": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Nevada's remote desert terrain and state park camping setting delivers legitimate adventure factor. Being the state's only gravel race adds pioneer appeal for Nevada cycling bragging rights. Remote location and sparse details suggest you're signing up for genuine uncertainty, which some riders crave."
      },
      "prestige": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "This is 'Nevada's 1st and only Gravel Grinder Event' which sounds impressive until you realize Nevada has like twelve people who ride gravel. Zero mention of notable winners, pros, or media coverage in the search results. Being first in Nevada is like being the tallest midget."
      },
      "race_quality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "The research turns up almost nothing about course details, aid stations, or organization quality. Official website exists and they have dates locked for 2025-2026, but that's bare minimum. When a race's own website doesn't showcase course maps or rider testimonials, that tells you everything."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Beaver Dam State Park setting could be scenic, but zero rider reports or race coverage surfaced in research. No details on post-race festivities, awards, or memorable course features. You're buying a lottery ticket on whether this delivers anything beyond 'I rode 50 miles in Nevada.'"
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "First-come-first-serve camping suggests grassroots vibes, but complete absence of rider forums, race reports, or community buzz is telling. When gravel nerds aren't talking about your race online, either it's brand new or forgettable. Nevada's small cycling scene limits growth potential."
      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Field of 33 riders in 2022 with six-hour average completion times suggests recreational participation levels. Non-timed format and emphasis on friendship over competition attracts weekend warriors rather than competitive depth."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "$60 registration includes park entry, breakfast, lunch, and dinner according to research. State park camping keeps lodging costs low, and the meal package plus aid station support delivers solid value for a non-competitive event."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Nevada location means flight costs for most riders, but Beaver Dam State Park camping keeps lodging cheap. No nearby major airports mentioned in research, suggesting drive time from Vegas or Salt Lake. Remote location cuts both ways on expense."
