This isn't a pure gravel race; it's a celebration of Bend's outdoor culture. The course mixes high desert gravel roads, doubletrack, and singletrack. Field is small (~500 across all events), vibe is community-focused. If you're looking for a competitive gravel race, look elsewhere. If you want a fun weekend in Bend with friends, beer, and dirt, this is it.",
