Steve Tilford racing it in 2013 and 2015 adds some legitimacy, but he was competing against regional guys like Garet Steinmetz and Brian Jensen. It's the kind of race that matters deeply to Midwest riders and nowhere else."
      },
      "race_quality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Course modifications removed a far loop and added one closer to Bass River Resort, improving logistics but not necessarily the rider experience. The final 8 miles are 'notoriously hard' partly because you ride past the finish line before continuing—that's amateur hour race design. Aid stations every 10 miles and decent trail maintenance keep it functional, but the organizational quirks show."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "The Berryman and Ozark Trail sections deliver legitimate technical singletrack with 'roots and rocks but also lots of sandy areas.' October leaves covering the trail create that blind-riding challenge Tilford described as 'very tight and mostly covered completely with dry leaves.' You're getting real trail riding, not just gravel grinding, which separates this from generic farm road suffering."
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Created by Scott and Jake from Springfield who know the Berryman area intimately, and their local knowledge shows in the course routing. YouTube race recaps calling it 'amazing' and 'just sign up for this event... just do it' reflect genuine rider enthusiasm. Regional riders return year after year, but it's not drawing the traveling circus that defines elite community."
      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Steve Tilford could show up and immediately race for the win against local competition in 2015. The Missouri gravel scene produces solid riders, but this isn't attracting national talent consistently. Regional depth is there—riders like Garet Steinmetz and Brian Jensen can race—but the competitive ceiling remains relatively low."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "You're getting 51-55 miles of legitimate IMBA Epic trail riding for whatever the entry fee costs. The Berryman and Ozark Trail sections are quality singletrack that many riders pay just to access recreationally. For Missouri, this represents solid bang for buck if you want technical trail racing rather than endless gravel roads."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Bass River Resort location near Steelville keeps accommodation costs reasonable compared to destination races. You're in rural Missouri, not California wine country, so lodging and food won't destroy budgets. The 'middle of nowhere in the Ozark Range' location means minimal tourism markup on essentials."
      },
      "length": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Current 51-55 mile distance hits the sweet spot for technical trail racing without becoming an endurance death march. The opening 3-4 miles of gravel climbing followed by sustained singletrack gives you time to settle into race pace. Long enough to matter, short enough that technical skills trump pure fitness."
      },
      "technicality": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "The Berryman Trail's IMBA Epic designation isn't marketing fluff—it's legitimate technical singletrack with 'roots and rocks' plus the challenge of leaf-covered trail in October. Riders report puncture problems on the 'smooth rocky singletrack,' and the technical terrain in the final 8 miles breaks people. This demands real bike handling, not just engine."
      },
      "elevation": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "5,261 feet of climbing over 51 miles delivers consistent work without massive suffer-fest peaks. The opening gravel climb sets the tone immediately, and the sustained nature keeps pressure on throughout. Missouri topography means rolling punishment rather than Alpine drama, but it accumulates effectively."
      },
      "climate": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "October in Missouri can deliver anything from perfect fall weather to miserable conditions. Trail reports show variability from 'dusty/loose' to '6-7 trees down' depending on recent weather. The leaf coverage Tilford described creates blind corner hazards regardless of temperature, and you're committed to whatever nature delivers."
      },
      "altitude": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "This is Missouri. You're nowhere near elevation that affects performance or requires acclimatization. The Ozark Range provides terrain character, not altitude training. Sea level riders show up and breathe normally throughout."
      },
      "logistics": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Bass River Resort provides a central hub, but the 'middle of nowhere' location limits options when things go wrong. Course modifications to bring the loop closer to the resort improved support access but shows the inherent logistical challenges. Remote Missouri location means you're committed once you're there—plan accordingly."
      },
      "adventure": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "IMBA Epic trail through the Ozarks delivers genuine backcountry feel, especially with October leaf cover creating that blind-riding challenge. The remote location and technical singletrack sections provide real adventure without manufactured difficulty. You're legitimately in the woods on quality trail, not just grinding gravel past corn fields."
