Steve Tilford racing it in 2013 and 2015 adds some legitimacy, but he was competing against regional guys like Garet Steinmetz and Brian Jensen. It's the kind of race that matters deeply to Midwest riders and nowhere else."

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Course modifications removed a far loop and added one closer to Bass River Resort, improving logistics but not necessarily the rider experience. The final 8 miles are 'notoriously hard' partly because you ride past the finish line before continuing—that's amateur hour race design. Aid stations every 10 miles and decent trail maintenance keep it functional, but the organizational quirks show."

        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "The Berryman and Ozark Trail sections deliver technical singletrack with 'roots and rocks but also lots of sandy areas.' October leaves covering the trail create that blind-riding challenge Tilford described as 'very tight and mostly covered completely with dry leaves.' You're getting real trail riding, not just gravel grinding, which separates this from generic farm road suffering."

        "explanation": "Created by Scott and Jake from Springfield who know the Berryman area intimately, and their local knowledge shows in the course routing. YouTube race recaps calling it 'amazing' and 'just sign up for this event... Just do it' reflect rider enthusiasm. Regional riders return year after year, but it's not drawing the traveling circus that defines elite community.

        "explanation": "Steve Tilford could show up and immediately race for the win against local competition in 2015. The Missouri gravel scene produces solid riders, but this isn't attracting national talent consistently. Regional depth is there—riders like Garet Steinmetz and Brian Jensen can race—but the competitive ceiling remains relatively low. Less competitive depth than Almanzo 100. As Steve Tilford puts it: \"The course is rocky. Really rocky. It is a mass start race, with a 250 rider field... The race starts on a road and goes up a mile long loose gravel climb.\""

        "explanation": "You're getting 51-55 miles of IMBA Epic trail riding for whatever the entry fee costs. The Berryman and Ozark Trail sections are quality singletrack that many riders pay just to access recreationally. For Missouri, this represents solid bang for buck if you want technical trail racing rather than endless gravel roads."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Registration runs $60-100. Bass River Resort location near Steelville keeps accommodation costs reasonable compared to destination races. You're in rural Missouri, not California wine country, so lodging and food won't destroy budgets. The 'middle of nowhere in the Ozark Range' location means minimal tourism markup on essentials. Similar expense level to Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Current 51-55 mile distance hits the sweet spot for technical trail racing without becoming an endurance death march. The opening 3-4 miles of gravel climbing followed by sustained singletrack gives you time to settle into race pace. Long enough to matter, short enough that technical skills trump pure fitness. Similar distance to Crusher in the Tushar. As Kansas City Rasta Rider puts it: \"57 miles...5 hours 43 minutes...1 broken water bottle cage...1 flat tire...53rd place overall...7th place in 20-29 age grouping...1st overall finisher under the age of 25.\""

        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "The Berryman Trail's IMBA Epic designation isn't marketing fluff—it's technical singletrack with 'roots and rocks' plus the challenge of leaf-covered trail in October. Riders report puncture problems on the 'smooth rocky singletrack,' and the technical terrain in the final 8 miles breaks people. This demands real bike handling, not just engine. More technical than most — comparable to Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego. As Carey Lowery puts it: \"Even though I was in the Ozarks, these mountains are old and eroded so the climbs are neither steep nor long. But today it felt like every climb was like Pinhoti #3.\""

        "explanation": "5,261 feet of climbing over 51 miles delivers consistent work without massive suffer-fest peaks. The opening gravel climb sets the tone immediately, and the sustained nature keeps pressure on throughout. Missouri topography means rolling punishment rather than Alpine drama, but it accumulates effectively. Similar elevation profile to Gravel Worlds.

October in Missouri can deliver anything from perfect fall weather to miserable conditions. Trail reports show variability from 'dusty/loose' to '6-7 trees down' depending on recent weather. The leaf coverage Tilford described creates blind corner hazards regardless of temperature, and you're committed to whatever nature delivers. More weather exposure than Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego. As Mark Gullett puts it: \"The descent to the Brazil Creek crossing was a sloppy muddy mess but there was a temporary bridge built across the water which was nice.\""

        "explanation": "This is Missouri. You're nowhere near elevation that affects performance or requires acclimatization. The Ozark Range provides terrain character, not altitude training. Sea level riders show up and breathe normally throughout. Lower altitude than Gravel Worlds — no thin-air concerns."

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Bass River Resort provides a central hub, but the 'middle of nowhere' location limits options when things go wrong. Course modifications to bring the loop closer to the resort improved support access but shows the inherent logistical challenges. Remote Missouri location means you're committed once you're there—plan accordingly."

        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "IMBA Epic trail through the Ozarks delivers backcountry feel, especially with October leaf cover creating that blind-riding challenge. The remote location and technical singletrack sections provide real adventure without manufactured difficulty. You're in the woods on quality trail, not just grinding gravel past corn fields."

gonna\nbe doing a lot more camping just\nI thought I'm not much of a cold person\nso\nwith these colder days come\nI really just don't feel like getting\nout there and camping I'd rather do the\nwarmer days maybe probably in the mostly\nthose rainy days too but\nwhat I want to add now\nI want to do more running content\nlike right now I'm doing a big training\nthing for a 50 miler race down\nthe Berryman in Missouri\nso I'm gonna do like a little training\num video update thing just kind of going\nthrough that I got this new camera here\nthat can\nI don't know I think I can\nprobably hold up for some good running\nvideos we'll see that's just something\nto mess around with hope you all enjoy\nit\nall right\nkind of a bigger Life Update with it too\nbecause\num\nback in November\nI was talking to my brother\nabout running the Berryman we even uh\nwent out there and hiked it a little bit\njust to kind of scope it out and I was\ntalking about a big camping trip I was\ngoing to do out there while also doing\nthe 50 miler\nso kept on talking about that Christmas\nI was talking about that\nso that's like the big Life Update there\nis a\nhe's no longer with us\nit's been about a month now actually\nit's actually exactly a month uh\nFebruary 4th\nI guess uh everything happened on\nJanuary 4th but\nthat is no longer here\nbut after all that talking with him\nabout the race\nI'm gonna do all I can to\nmake sure I do that race\nall signed up for it\nwould be a good one we're gonna we're\ngonna run far\ncrank we're gonna run far\n15 minute warm-up done\nmuscles are feeling great body's feeling\ngood\njust gonna give a the calves a little\nbit of a stretch\nand then I'll get going\nI should have looked at it I think the\ntraining was\nfive\nno it was four\nfour intervals three minutes long per\ninterval three minute cooldown per\ninterval so\nit could take a little bit of time\nactually\nthree three three three three three\nthree three three three\nI'll be recording as I get all right\nthree minute interval you know that\nseems like a long time but\nit says ease into the interval\nget to your speed hold it and then ease\nback so I think 30 seconds to get up to\nspeed 30 seconds to pull back\nwe'll see how it goes but let's do this\nall right one two three go\nI don't know\nvery much very long time\nyeah my goodness\nthree minutes\nit wasn't too bad\na three minute break is going to be\nhandy\nif you can tell\nI'm breathing but I mean I I can still\ntalk so that's always a good news\nround one down\nyeah just kind of wanted to put that\nlife update out there there's\njust gonna be a lot more content maybe\njust about running in general\nit's my one of my favorite path actually\nit's my favorite past I'm happy to do\nthat besides camping and yoga I got a\nlot of a lot of things but running yoga\ncamping\nand then another thing I want to kind of\nlook into\nFrank was always a big uh astronomy guy\ngetting something to do at night be able\nto look at the stars and then while I'm\ncamping might as well know what the\nstars are all about so hopefully I'm\ncamping in a really nice clear days\nbeautiful stars up there\nthis guy\nso yeah\njust keep an update and keep a watch on\nthe channel\noh\njust be posting here and there if I know\nI'm still gonna do the camping videos\nbut you'll just see some running videos\non there so\nwe'll get this Berryman done\nthat's for sure\ngood morning hi\n[Music]\nthank you\nI screwed up there\nwell that way\nI feel like I really need a stick right\nnow\nhey\nlook at that\nlet's follow him\nback at it again\ntoday is Sunday\nAugust wait August\nit's February I think this is a long\nways away all right so it's\nFebruary\n5th\nSunday\nthis is the\nlast week of the first month for my\ntraining\nit's uh my update on how the progress is\ngoing is going on right now\nI'll say\nit's 50 mile training it is\ntough\nreally really tough\nI started off with the intervals\nmoving on to template runs doing the\nEnduro runs\nit only gets more difficult they're out\nof the program but I'm still feeling\npretty strong\nuh\nwell\nI guess on a Wednesday last week I was\non a recovery run I thought something\nreally weird\nin my\nmy calves Cali shut up towards the hip\ntoo which kind of made me scratch my\nhead\nso I did the next best thing that you\ncould possibly do is instead of\ncontinuing on\nstopped\nwent back home\nassess the situation\nThursday came around\nmy plan was to do a temper run that day\nI went to work\nlooked at my leg\nworked on it stretched it everything\nand from there\nI just decided\nthey don't listen to your body Wayne\nthere's no need\nto push yourself every single day\nbecause you're just gonna get yourself\nhurt\nthe training plan is here to guide you\nnow it's my goal to make sure I don't\nget hurt\nso Thursday\nrest day no Temple Run Friday it's\nalready a rough day so I gave you two\ngood days of resting\nand then Saturday came around\nwoke up\nfeeling great my leg is kind of back up\nto where it needs to be again\nwent out for\nI guess there was an hour run in the\nmorning\ngot back to Des Moines\nat the\nFleet Feet shoe store where I'm a mentor\nfor the half marathon training program\nyeah\nall right continued on my hour 30 run\nwith them\ndoing the remainder 30 minutes grinding\nwith them so I got the hour and a half\ndone there heading out today\nhis that last day\nfor the monthly\nnext month gets a little more difficult\nbut\ngive it a two hour endurance run today\nbefore this film\nI'm really really still cautious so\nI went over to\nmy yoga studio I got my the Des Moines\nwhat am I saying here\nI went over to the yoga studio where I\ngo where I attend and\nI did a restore class so some Yin Yoga\nand just kind of really worked into the\nfascia into those really deep\ntissue fibers or whatever they wanted to\ncall them\nI did that for about an hour felt good\ndon't don't\nreally good\nthen from there\nI asked people it's like mind if I just\nleave my car here yeah\njust take off from the yoga studio you\ngo for my run\nthat's what I did\nand on the Run\nI am so far an hour into it\nand I am feeling great I'm gonna\ncontinue on path here\nI just counted this straight out and\nback thing\nyeah I'm actually out here in Waukee\nIowa\nI've never really done much running out\nhere so\nwhen you got all these long endurance\nruns might as well\nmake fun of it\nand just explore the area in which you\nlive\nand why not you're you're here\nyou got the time\njust do it\nnext things more interesting next\nthing's more fun just being in different\nplaces seeing new things\nyeah yeah\nso the plan's going good I am\nI guess there's four months to go and\nlike I said they get more and more\ndifficult\nI can't tell but it actually looks like\nMarch\nin early April is really\nwhere it's gonna be tested in my limits\nI'm excited\nI really really want to know what my\nlimits are\nreally want to push those boundaries\nand just\njust continue on\nwe're out here running now\nI hope you're enjoying this\nbecause the weather right now\nis just absolutely superb I think we got\nlike\nI think they're saying it's like 30\ndegrees outside but I mean with my\nsweatshirt on I'm even kind of wearing\nlike some short style things\nlaughs\nand\nit feels so good\nthere's a loop here\nlet's just get lost I really have no\nplan just hopefully there's not a\nmountain lion like a cougar whatever you\nwant to call them\nfollowing me\ncould be\nor it's all just my imagination\nwhich that's more likely all right here\nwe go\nthere were a few days in the program\nwhere I started I mean the training\nprogram started\nJanuary 2nd\neverything fell apart\nFebruary 4th so I missed two days of the\ntraining because\nhonestly I just didn't want to do it I\nwasn't up to it I couldn't even think\nabout running I really just had to get\nhome get to get to my parents and just\ngo Mom Dad I'm here\nso I did that\nand then\nwhat I figured everything was all\nsituated\nI was able to kick back into action\nit still sucks\nI don't like saying that word\nbut it really\nnothing nothing's fun about this I'm not\ntired of the training program it's just\ntalking about grieving\nit's a process\njust like any other thing\nwe get through it\nstill just makes you wonder every single\ntime now\nwhy was\nsomebody brought into your life\nfor so long\nfrom birth actually I mean he was around\nme 32 years\nand I'm just\nups and goes\nmakes you wonder\nwhat\nI can't\ncan't dwell\nI can't just sink\nthe boat keeps moving it keeps sailing\nforward\nalways\nyou give that a stick but why why let\nyourself sink\nFrank wouldn't want that\nand I don't want that\nI am progressing\nat least I hope so I really know I think\nit's Progressive so\nkeep with me\nif you want to see this progress\nlike And subscribe if you want\nit really doesn't matter to me\nI'm gonna have some fun here so get\nready\nfor some fun\nI'm gonna get again continue on with the\nrun here so I'll catch back up with you\nin just a bit but time to get back to\nfocus here and let my mind sink back\ninto that right mindful spot here\ncatch back into you later",
