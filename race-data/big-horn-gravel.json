      "verdict": "ROWDY SLEEPER HIT",
      "summary": "Big Horn Gravel is what happens when you build a gravel race for people who think gravel races aren't hard enough. The 3,000 ft opening wall, the rutted Jeep roads, the technical singletrack - this is 'aggressive Colorado gravel' that makes pros switch to hardtails. Dylan Johnson got his biggest check here. The Vegan Cyclist calls it the best gravel race you've never heard of. It won't stay unknown for long.",
      "quote": "'Just because a race is advertised as a gravel race does not necessarily mean that a gravel bike is the right bike for the job.' - Dylan Johnson",
      "strengths": [
        "The terrain: Genuinely rowdy. Drop-bar hardtail territory.",
        "The challenge: 10K ft at altitude with technical surfaces. Real consequences.",
        "The obscurity (for now): Small field, big payoff, growing fast."
      ],
      "weaknesses": [
        "The obscurity: Not a resume race yet. Few people outside Colorado know it.",
        "The technicality: If you've only done smooth gravel, you'll suffer.",
        "The opening wall: Blow up in the first 13 miles and your day is ruined."

      "title": "THE THING NOBODY TELLS YOU",
      "reality": "The opening 3,000 ft climb in 13 miles will wreck your race if you treat it like a road race. Multiple riders report blowing up here and never recovering. Add rutted Jeep roads at altitude and you've got a recipe for suffering that most gravel races can't match.",
      "consequences": [
        "Wrong bike choice = misery. Many riders wish they'd brought a hardtail or drop-bar MTB instead of a pure gravel race rig.",
        "Wrong tire choice = flats. 38mm tires get destroyed. People run up to 2.1 MTB tires.",
        "Wrong pacing = DNF. The opening wall sets up your whole day. Go out too hard and you'll detonate before halfway."

      "quote": "'Even though the race is only 75 miles I did not talk to a single person who wanted to go out and do more.' - Ben Delaney",
      "expectation_reset": "This is not Midwest gravel. This is 'aggressive Colorado gravel' that demands MTB skills, wider tires, and conservative pacing. Come prepared or come home broken."

      "score": "73 / 100",

      "should_you_race": "Yes if you want genuinely hard gravel racing that tests your technical skills, altitude tolerance, and pacing discipline. Big Horn is 'the best gravel race you've never heard of' - but it won't stay unknown for long. Come prepared for aggressive terrain and you'll have an unforgettable day.",
      "alternatives": "If you want Colorado altitude without the tech: SBT GRVL (champagne gravel). If you want similar rowdiness: Gunni Grinder. If you want technical but less altitude: BWR California."
