Late August Montana weather proved challenging with poor air quality from California wildfire smoke. Peterson reports \"My chest wall became tender to the touch from the act of trying to breathe\" and \"The Tobacco Root Mountains that are normally readily viewable had been entirely obscured,\" plus rain on climbs. More weather exposure than Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

Similar altitude considerations to Grinduro."
