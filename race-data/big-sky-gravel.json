Peterson had \"done this climb before and performed much better\" but struggled with pacing decisions, showing the elevation demand is substantive for the distance."

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Late August Montana weather proved challenging with poor air quality from California wildfire smoke.

        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Red Lodge sits in Beartooth foothills with the race reaching elevations high enough to impact performance. Peterson experienced \"heart rate markedly higher than anticipated all day\" during her effort, suggesting altitude plays a role for riders coming from lower elevations despite not being extreme Colorado territory."
      },
      "adventure": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "\"The Red Lodge and surrounding area is known for its immense landscapes connected by gravel roads in Carbon County.\" Race organizers encourage riders to \"stay and play in Red Lodge, the Beartooth Pass and take in local amenities.\" Remote enough that Custer Gallatin camping is viable lodging."

        "explanation": "Basic organization includes GPS support, marked routes, and drop bag service at miles 8, 31, 60, and 86. However, packet pickup until 6:30 AM race morning and post-race food not starting until 11 AM when leaders should be finishing suggests small-town operation stretching resources."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Race director \"hosted a picnic for us at Beall Park(race start location)\" with bike inspections and social distance meet-ups. Downtown Roosevelt Center location provides town access, and the Saturday Cocktail Loop preview ride adds social elements, though the overall experience remains modest in scale."
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Montana Tour nonprofit organizes with \"proceeds benefit our Community Bike Center\" and volunteer discounts. Race philosophy emphasized being \"a training ground for others looking to train for TransAm or Tour Divide,\" creating supportive atmosphere for big ride preparation rather than competitive racing focus."
      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Limited competitive depth with three distance options spreading participation thin. Peterson's race report suggests small field sizes with riders knowing each other personally, and the original \"no placements or awards\" philosophy indicates focus on participation over competitive talent attraction."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "$70-$107 registration includes finish food, rider gift, swag bag, route nutrition, hydration, and SAG support - decent package for Montana pricing. Drop bag service for the 100-miler at four locations shows thoughtful logistics. Not expensive for what you get, just don't expect premium execution."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Peterson chose \"a bed every night to get better sleep\" using local lodging options, with Redlodge.com/stay accommodations plus Custer Gallatin camping for budget travelers. Getting to Carbon County requires serious travel commitment, but small mountain town costs beat resort destination pricing once there."
