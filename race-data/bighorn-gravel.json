          "transcript": "what's up\ndude so this one time in Gypsum Colorado\nI raced two gravel races back to back\nyeah\nis it cool if I do the 50. are you\nserious yeah I'm serious let's go do it\nagain huh\n[Music]\nhey EVC here and today we're talking\nabout a race in Colorado my favorite\ngravel rates I've been to ever so here's\nDenver here's where we are it's a little\ntown called gypsum and it is maybe the\nbest gravel race that you've never heard\nof Dylan Johnson was there uh getting\nready for Leadville dude's absolutely\nflying also on suspension forks uh so\nhere's the layout of the big course okay\nso there's two courses there's the\nBighorn and the little horn we're racing\nthe Bighorn and it is stacked after\nUnbound I was at an all-time low with my\nconfidence and just like in my head and\nso I had actually chosen this race\nbecause it's like it's a second year\nrace like it's only happened one year\nbefore and I thought dude the\ncompetitions like to be that that stiff\nlike I'm gonna be able to go and like\npoach a good result and like up my\nconfidence bro there was so many people\nhere and so many hitters also it's at\nelevation it's from 6 000 to 10.\nokay\nelevation\nhurts\nso at elevation you're top into your\nmotor is basically sheared off you also\ndon't have very many matches okay so\nlike recovering under an effort so if\nyou're trying to do your sea level Watts\nat 8 000 feet boy you're gonna blow up\nquick so I'm trying to Pace myself but\neveryone's flying so I check in with my\ngarment how am I doing\nyeah you suck\ncool thanks Carmen thanks for the\nconfidence the competition here was\nextremely stiff uh there was about 10 or\nso lifetime competitors all getting\nready for Leadville uh we've barely\nstarted we haven't even gotten to the\nfirst section yet and so we hit the\nfirst climb\nokay so what makes a good gravel course\nI've gotten that opportunity to race so\nmany different courses and in my opinion\nit's it's where a course can suit any\ntype of writer like whatever skill you\nhave you can apply it to a course right\nso if you're really good at downhill if\nyou're really good at steep climbs and\nPunchy stuff uh maybe you're really good\nat long climbs maybe you're really good\nat elevation like that's what I love\nabout gravel so much is that it finds\nout like who's the best overall Rider\nright pacing fueling bike handling it's\njust it's just so amazing now I came\ninto this wanting to Pace myself because\nI did not pace myself at Unbound and I\nam Pace myself right out of this race I\nI did go maybe a little too hard right\nat the beginning and I got kind of\nscared because of elevation I was like\noh I gotta really tone this down a\nlittle bit\num and I'm just thinking this whole time\noh dude I'm gonna get these guys later\nDylan Johnson's still behind me so if\nI'm in front of Dylan no big deal right\nand then all of a sudden Here Comes\nDylan and then I was like oh I should\njump on his wheel\nnope there's just no way I could get on\nhis wheel the dude went from like 50th\nor 60th all the way up to third it was\ninsane so like he did\nthe strategy I'd hoped to do we Crest\nthe top of the hill and I'm gonna take a\nsurvey of like how far back am I right\nso I start counting all the heads it is\ntoo many to count I want to stop but we\nkeep writing I tell myself that I'm\ngonna get back all these spots later so\nI'm trying to get past some guys this\nguy really did not want me to pass uh he\nkept taking this one line I was like all\nright cool it's no big deal I'll pass\nyou later I can't like I did not want me\nto pass and so dude I've passed I'll\nzero people until these two and so then\nlike yeah man all right I actually\npassed two people I know how to ride a\nbike maybe it's the small things right\ngotta build your confidence so then we\nhit this rip in descent\nthank you\npretty crummy start that was uh\nman a lot at the beginning kind of tried\nto Pace it\nwe're way back but we feel good\njust did not have the spice at the\nbeginning\nso we're gonna work our way through time\nto work\nso we hit that first really steep climb\nRed Hill and now we're on to gypsum\nCreek which is really really long really\nbig uh very flat we've now connected\ninto the little horn which so they\nskipped Red Hill okay so all these\npeople are from the the smaller course\nso many people right and actually pretty\ndecent because we're getting a little\nbit of a draft here through them uh it's\npretty good timing that we caught the\nshort course in that section\nI mean it's not a ton of drop but it's\nsomething\nbut it's a bummer because this is where\nthat front group is just Motoring\nwhoopsie now the racer promoters that\ntold me I needed to get over Red Hill\nwith the front group to have any chance\nbecause gypsum Creek is so long it's\nsuch a long climb but it's very it's\nvery shallow it's uh it's super fast if\nyou're in a group and so it kind of\nworked out well for me because I was\ncatching the the little course so I kind\nof had a little bit of a draft but\nessentially you know me and like six\nseven guys we're kind of Motoring I'm\nfeeling like I am going as hard as I\npossibly can I'm very happy with with\nwhere my power is but and I want to talk\na little bit about where my power has\nfallen is that I mean I I keep writing I\nkeep training I keep getting fitter but\nbecause I keep doing all this Ultra\nstuff and that's been my focus and\nthat's really my strong suit is that\nI've completely changed my power profile\nit's a little bit frustrating when you\ngo to races because they just don't have\nthe top end that I used to but I have\nthe ability to go forever\nwith that said look how beautiful this\nis wow\nit is beautiful\nthis rips\nokay so my power here's my zones roughly\nokay they fluctuate but this is where\nthey are right now most people would\ntrack like eight to six hours six to\nfour four to one mine's 45 to 25 hours\n25 to 15 15 to 30. so that's insane okay\nthe the amount of time I can spend in\nthese zones but as I've been doing more\nUltra stuff my top end has just gotten\nsmashed this feels amazing but then just\nright over that this feels like death\nit's so weird it was always me versus me\nit was never me for the shoes\nit was always me versus me it was never\nme for sure\nme for shoes so we get to this really\nreally steep part the whole climb is\nreally shallow and mellow it's no big\ndeal uh but then right at the end it's\nit pitches up big time now again like I\nwas talking about my power it's very\nstrange you know I can just go forever\nuh right below threshold okay but as\nsoon as I go over threshold or I start\nto go into those higher numbers man I\njust I just crumble so quickly and so\nit's frustrating but right now man I am\ntrying to go as hard as I can I don't\nthink I'm gonna do this again\nyeah dude yeah\nokay so we caught a few guys on that\nlast climb but I wasn't with the group\nso this is it this is where I'm Gonna\nCatch everyone I brought the suspension\nFork you know we're rolling this is so\nmuch fun the single track is great\nthis was probably one of my favorite\nParts just like visually uh and it was\nso much fun\nsir\nyo\nRock whoa gnarly okay so we had a really\nsteep climb we had a fast descent wasn't\nvery technical then a little bit of road\nthen some flat then that really long\nclimb and then now we're into some\nsingle tracks so just what this course\nis offering is just is it's everything\nit's everything you would want out of\nbike racing\nnow I think I'm absolutely going warp\nspeed there's no one that could possibly\ngoing faster than me but why haven't I\ncaught anyone and I hear someone behind\nme hey can I get by\nand I'm just like\nwell how many people was I holding up\ndude like I thought I was I thought I\nwas ditching everyone and then like\nagain this guy's hey man when when you\nget a chance can I get by like being\nsuper nice and then I'm like okay I mean\nsure and then I get over and it's just a\ntrain of dudes\nI got railed by a train of dudes\ncool\ndamn it\noh man I was a total squid dude I I just\nwas not vibing us\ndang it dude I lost so much time on that\nthing\nall righty just kidding this is the time\nthat I'm really gonna put it down and\nI'm Gonna Catch everyone here because\nthis is the hardest and biggest climb\neveryone has gone way too hard no one\nknew how to ride I'm Gonna Catch\neveryone I'm gonna go from 50th to first\nright now that's the plan anyways\nbecause long steady climbs This Is My\nJam and I live at 3 400 feet which isn't\nreally elevation okay uh but I most my\nrides go up to 72. I feel like I'm\npretty good at elevation\nand at this point I've I've really\nlocked in like where that limiter is for\nme\nwhich is way higher than I thought it\nwas so it's like it's so strange my\npower\nlike 400 watts and I'm getting that\nfuzzy feeling where you have no oxygen\nin your blood and you feel like you're\ngonna puke uh and and then your power\njust completely falls off a cliff but\nlike around like 320 to 350 it wasn't it\nwas fine it was so strange and so I'm\nmotoring I'm feeling good I'm catching\nno one right Dad like maybe I'm super\nfar back I mean I think I caught like\nthree people and so cool I I moved from\nyou know 48 to 44th like but dude who\ncares it's so pretty out here and I am\nabsolutely having the time in my life\nbut I am on the limit I know it doesn't\nlook like it but I'm on the limit\noh\n[Applause]\nso then there was an out and back\nbecause they had to change the course\nfor uh snow reasons and now we're gonna\nfly down this descent and you know this\nguy in the red it was really crazy we\nwent back and forth like freaking 30\ntimes huge descent and so let's just do\nwe got suspension bro\nso I connect with these two guys I've\nbeen connecting with with like one or\ntwo people throughout the entire race\neither I would climb better than them\nand they would sin better than me or\nvice versa or whatever we're just kind\nof going back and forth and we're going\nto talk about this little tiny section\nin between you know before the next big\nlast climb\nwe get this double track\nbro I think I'm going as fast as I can\nbut these guys just dust me I mean it's\nsuper fun out here I mean it's great but\nwhen you're racing and I'm feeling like\ndude I'm not doing very well uh I'd like\nto be doing better I was kind of really\nquestioning what was going on like why I\nwasn't be able why I wasn't able to\ndescend faster\nI don't really know the answer to that I\nwas running on 38s my tire pressure was\na little hard\nwho cares whatever we get to a rest stop\nI stopped at zero so I have no opinion\non the rest stops they could have been\nthe best rest stops ever I don't know\ndidn't stop at them\nmaybe maybe that's another reason why\nI've fallen into this like zone three\npit where I can just ride pretty hard\nforever for days uh at a time you know\nbut I just don't have that high end I\ndon't have that top top gear race pace\nis because I don't like my fueling is so\nslow and I've gotten dialed to where\nlike again okay spoiler alert I do this\ncourse twice uh and I didn't stop at any\nstations whatsoever zero stops\n10 hour ride Zero stops okay so I've got\nall my stuff on me\nmaybe that's an issue we hit into this\nanother single track probably for me the\nbest part on the course I\nI wasn't going very fast okay people\nwere definitely flying through this\nbut I was having the time in my life the\nberms and there was like some chatter so\nthe suspension was working really well\nthe ups and downs I mean this just to me\nfeels like Moto like we're flying right\nit's a little hard to tell but the\ncolors in my mind the way I remember\nthis was so vibrant and there was a\nsection where I was kind of going\nthrough some like purple flowers like\nright here there's like flowers on the\nedge and I mean you're just flying it\ndidn't feel so good and that's another\nbig part of why this is an awesome\ngravel Race So this course is awesome is\nthat there's many different things\nthere's good racing but there's also\nParts where you're having fun\ngood work dude\ngood work\ngetting some encouragement because\nthat's what we do we're behind this guy\nin all black me and him have sort of\nbeen glued to each other like he's just\nkilling me on the descents and then I'd\ncatch him on the climbs and just back\nand forth back and forth again Dynamic\nracing so I passed him and he said he\ncouldn't get rid of me\nnow a really good course wouldn't be a\ngood course or a dynamic course without\na little bit of mud okay now I'm very\ntraumatized by mud but we do find\nourselves a mud section\nabout it\nit wasn't that bad it was like a hundred\nfeet of mud so no big deal now talking\nabout a dynamic of course this course\nends with this crazy super steep very\ntechnical uh pitch and look if you're a\nclimber like this is this is your bread\nand butter this is your chance to get\naway from these these absolute you know\nCinder dudes\num I felt really good on it my gear\nratio is crazy uh this is a 46 in the\nfront and 11 52 in the rear so I've got\nall the gears we Crest the top of the\nfinal climb there's a little rest stop\nat the top here doing whiskey and bacon\nthat's like uh kind of like a surprise\nlike you've done all the hard stuff\nhere's some whiskey and bacon I didn't\nstop because I didn't stop any rest\nstops we hit this really fast Ascent\nagain\nDynamic course also means bike choice so\nwhatever bike you brought there was a\nsection on this course that absolutely\nlended itself to that bike and I was\nvery happy I brought a suspension Fork I\nshould have done a bigger front tires on\nthe 38 should have went way bigger than\nthat also should have brought the\ndropper post but I was kind of trying to\ngo wait so\nmy American-made 3D printed custom\nfitted Cav helmet absolutely the move\nI'm coming in here to the Finish\nuh 42nd okay\nTyler\nis it cool if I do the 50.\nis that do you think I have time\noh you want more yeah if I went out and\ndid the 50 course right now he'd win it\nin fact\nso well I mean is that okay\nyeah I'm serious actually yeah\ndude amazing like unbelievable like\neverything you would want in a race\ncourse\nand just like the town and the vibe and\nyou know if you just went down the list\nlike everything is just there's so much\nto say about it but like it has\nsomething for everyone like whatever\nyour skill set is and it was really cool\nhow it raced you know I'd I'd catch guys\non the the long steady climbs which is\nsuch my jam then I would just get\nabsolutely annihilated on the technical\ndescent and then I'd come back and then\nget past and I was back and forth and\nback and forth and I mean I think me and\nthis one dude in the blue like passed\neach other like 50 times is crazy and\nlike how awesome is that you know but\ndude I had so much fun so much fun in\nfact\nI'm actually gonna go out and do the\nother course the 50 mile so we did the\n80 Mile and you know I'm not done\nI'm so hyped right now I'm so vibing and\nI and maybe that's like oh well he got\nclapped out in the race and then he's\njust gonna do more to like Flex\nI gave it my all dude I honestly raced\nthe best race I possibly could have\nnormalized 262 Watts for freaking five\nand a half hours I mean dude I was\nrolling I was really happy with my power\nuh just kind of rode a little goofy but\nanyways whatever dude let's go do it\nagain huh look I wasn't done riding and\nthis course was ripped and what am I\ngoing to do just hang out\nso the short course uh cuts out two of\nthe climbs from the big course\nand so we're gonna do it again because I\nwant to because I like riding bikes and\nI wasn't tired which is frustrating\nbecause it's like in my head I think\nwell bro if you're not tired just ride\nharder be better be faster use this all\nthis energy in a different way but my\nbody is just like in this mode where I\njust\nI feel like I'm on the limit like any\nharder I go I'm gonna just explode but\nclearly that's not the case because I\nget done with the 77 mile ride at 10 000\nfeet of climbing at elevation and I'm\nmy heart rate's like 60. so of course\nI'm gonna go back out and ride I'm in\nColorado I got nothing to do my family's\nnot here what am I supposed to do I want\nto ride I want to check out this place\nand this second lap has the hyping man I\nwas just crushing in my American-made\ncustom fitted 3D printed helmet from Cav\nthis matte white this helmet that I'm\nwearing dude you've never seen anything\nlike it it's custom fitted to me it's 3D\nprinted it has no retention strap the\nthing is money you can check out Cav\nsports for more on the helmet so we hit\nthis double track section again\nabsolutely flying love this thing love\nlove this whole course like I've already\nsaid a thousand times but so why again\nam I doing this why am I writing this\ncourse again when there's no reason I'm\nnot racing anyone there's there's no\npoint it's not like there's\na double header where\nI'm gonna be like oh I was the best to\ndo double where I I won the Big Horn\ndouble I'm the only one out there doing\nit\nI'll say that I don't really totally\nknow why other than I just genuinely\nlike riding bikes uh I was already here\nin Colorado my family's not here like\nwhat else am I gonna do\nI want to ride and look at this look at\nthis purple flowers yellow flowers green\ndude this to me is where I'm like you\nknow\njust in my element\nnow the other thing is that I've got\nthis big race coming up 502 miles 38 000\nfeet of climbing ultra distance\nNationals in Oregon so I do need to prep\nfor that uh I already told you in the\nUnbound video that I kind of like got\nreal in my head about even\nwearing that Jersey and accepting that\nbecause like\nhow prestigious is it\nbut I don't care dude I want to win it\nagain I want to be a two-time\nso we're training huh we did it\nthat's all the climbing\nwow\nthat was fun dude\nand a 502 mile race\ntakes a totally different type of power\nprofile and that's why a lot of the\nultra guys they don't really look really\nfast like they don't look super fit they\njust um\nthey just can ride forever and that's\nkind of where I'm at\nnow 124 miles\n10 hours 15 000 feet of climbing zero\nstops 80 wasn't enough huh I had to do\nit again man\nhahaha\nhere we go buddy\nclimb those stairs to get ourselves\nfifteen thousand feet\nI genuinely love riding bikes\nall day long\nI wanted to do that I'm stoked\nyou",

ShakeOut ride so got the leg\nstretch out a little bit today\nI'm doing the route that's\nabout 50 I think and from what I\nunderstand that's going to be funny\num\nbad news is Cassie is not here with me\nthis weekend unfortunately she couldn't\nmake it so no tandem this weekend\nfor a day or so I thought about\nriding the tandem solo at this event\nbut\nthey're chatting with a few folks that\nhave ridden this route\nand a few others and given my condition\nright now yeah that's probably not\nhappening\nprobably not finishing with that so\nhere we are\non the surly\nheading out for some high elevation\nclimbing\nI think it's something like\nfive or six thousand feet of elevation\nin 50 miles\nlooks like he climbed for the first 15\nor so\nso we're gonna feel it\nwe're just gonna do we can to finish\ntoday and have fun so\nhere we go we'll see you out there\nso a few miles in\nand interestingly the front of the long\nroute\ngoes out and does a loop\ngood morning\nI can't remember how long that Loop is\nbut they start an hour before us and\nthey've already caught\nand they're moving through this\nthis route\nI believe the real climbing spots again\nso I thought I'd say hello\nwe're that slow death star\nso far this time has not been too\nterrible pitches up levels out pitches\nup levels out\nalong this Creek\nI know some terrible stuff is coming up\nthat being said I've been in my Granny\ngear\nfor like a half hour\nmorning\nbeautiful morning really\nso a little update probably\nedging in on an hour and a half in an\nevent\nyou can work on our way up this Valley\nfor quite a while I uh\nmay not surprised you attend struggle a\nlittle bit at elevation\nwhat I've learned that works well for me\nis trying to\npay attention to my heart rate\nand kind of\ngive myself a governor that uh\nI found if I go too high\nI'm going to be in for a long day it's\nhard to recover so\nI've been taking it pretty easy\ncouldn't be a bit of a day\nand uh trying not to murder myself here\nin the first\n15 or 20 miles TBD if that works\nstop for quick stretch and some peanut\nbutter pretzels\nI see some\nreceiver stuff has come\nand it's going to be continuing for a\nwhile so\nCatch My Breath a little starting to\nfeel it\nbeautiful place\nas you can see\nwe reached our first\nwalking section\nI think I'm close to like a mile from\nthe top\nturned on different right here oh she\npitched up more than I can handle\njust take a little walk\nwouldn't be going much faster\nriding\nwell I walk\nwith this beautiful backdrop\nthat'd be a good time for a story\nso I was planning on\ntaking a few bottles and a hydration\npack today and looking at all the stops\nand whatnot\nlast minute I decided I'll just take\nthree bottles\ndrop the pack\ns ago I just realized that\nI had put\nmost of my nutrition\nall of my gels\nin my hydration pack\nwhen I dropped it this morning\nbefore I headed out\ndidn't grab it\nyou grab any of it\nI did get\none bottle super fuel\ndown\nand I've been munching on peanut butter\npretzels\ntrying to keep up with hydration\nI'm an idiot\noh that was a hill glad to be here\nrough\nlong downhill coming I believe\nall right\ndon't\ntry to fix my head it's just your\nanxiety\nI've been riding the single tracks at\noh\nnot for a gravel bike definitely not\nfair\nand I see why there's so many mountain\nbikes on the start line\nSteve\na little bit Rocky\npretty nice mountain bike\ngonna drop a person in the clutch\nstatus update that's the signal track\nread along\nreal gravel paved now we just turned it\nback up a climb back on gravel I don't\nknow we're probably 20 something in 30.\na little more I'm out here right now\nall right folks again I'm by myself\ntoday can't have your snacks from the\nback\nwhat I do have is this uncrustable\nthat's been in my pocket for six hours\ntoday's episode of which feels like\nI feel like I'm gonna try and eat\nwithout puking\nlet's see how it goes\nwhat we have is a peanut butter and\nstrawberry jam\nsandwich\nwithout crust\nwhat I prefer to do these is they come\nin the freezer\nis you get them when they're just thawed\na little bit and still cold\nthat's the ticket\noh yeah right\nokay\nthis is not feeling great\nlet me give you my review of that\nuncrustable\nit was warm the jelly was a little too\nsweet\ngot it down so that's a success\ncheckpoint too got a Coke and some chips\nwalking some semi truck for a while now\nbecause it's not rideable because I'm\nfeeling pretty rough beautiful Trail\nand pretty hot\npretty nauseous\nso just trying to\nkeep going through the lows but keep\nmoving at least a little bit\npretty big low right now\nI'm hot\nthat's up where do you fall on a cactus\nhe got a lot of it right in the old\nbuttsky\ncondolences to that guy\noh the wheels are fully falling off now\nsince the second sag walked up some Zoom\nTrack Road down\nup a bunch more single track\nroad down I'm in a bad spot here\nthe heat right now I can't get enough\npower to really\neven on some of my flat Trail\nnot great\nthat was official\nwell of course dnf\nremember the last\nthing if I had like Mid-South 2\n000.\noh miss\nit looks like I got at least eight miles\nof riding\nso now the inventor is finding my way\nhome\nwell here I am\nback in\nchips\nthat wasn't\nan event so\nI was like 10 miles\naway from the Finish but we were kind of\nheading back into the back country even\nfurther started getting a little worried\nabout my condition so I decided to turn\nback or there was a medic thinking I\ncould get out that way I ended up having\nthe ride I think I rode further dnf and\nthen if I were to just finish the\nfreaking thing\nbut I read I'd ride myself the whole way\nback which like I got myself in that\nposition so so be it but uh\nGod that was a disaster pull the plug\nanother day\nit's the first time I've dnf'd in a\nwhile\nit reached me from my winter",

are on Straight Ahead gravel\nbikes here at Bighorn gravel I brought a\nhigh-end loner thank you chemo Seymour\nfor this sweet specialized s-works epic\nhardtail and was happy to have both the\nsuspension and the big old 2.3 tires\nfast kids at the front of the race they\nwere not messing around with mountain\nbikes they were riding straight up\ngravel bikes although we saw Dylan\nJohnson who came in third on a bit of a\nhybrid a hard tail factor with a smaller\nsuspension fork and drop bars in this\nvideo I'm going to talk about the bike\nthe race course of bighorn gravel here\nin Gypsum Colorado and how the two of\nthose paired and how I fared\n[Applause]\nI'm third I figure I'm third on the\nYouTube Podium today\ntrue to form I managed to shoot myself\nin the foots\nor in the front brake you know some\nlessons you just have to learn and\nrelearn and relearn\ntoday's lesson courtesy this chucklehead\nwas when you take your front wheel off\nto put the bike in the car put the brake\nblock inside the front caliper\nI had a brake block I didn't put it in\nthere and I took the bike out this\nmorning popped the wheel in and realized\nthat I could barely touch the front\nbrake before it was fully breaking and\nthe thing was just chirping chirping at\nme all day\nuh I stopped\nI don't know mile 15 or something like\nthis when I found I was doing like 400\nwatts on a flat Road in the group I was\nlike what is going on took the wheel off\ngot my tire lever in there trying to get\nthe\nthe pads to retract\nyou know if I just\ntaken all of three seconds to put that\nbrake Block in there would have had no\nsuch issue but\nas it was\nso it goes\nBighorn gravel it's a hard event it is a\nhard event we're up here at I don't know\n7000 feet in Gypsum Colorado which is\njust east of vale everybody knows Vale\nright some some fancy uh ski living\nthere I know nothing about this but I do\nknow it's beautiful up in these\nmountains the course was rerouted a\ncouple days ago because there was still\nyou know multiple feet of snow up at the\nhigh point we still had some 10 000 feet\nof climbing over 75 miles so we got our\nmoney's worth and then some one benefit\nof the out and back kind of like\nLeadville\nas you get to see what's happening at\nthe front of the race Eric Bruner and\nHowie grass just come blazing past\none two\ngot one of the country's best cycle\ncross racers on the country's best\nmountain bike racers\ngiving her\nthe mere Immortals\non the other hand\nwe've still got a long way to climb\nsure is pretty though\npart of the secret sauce for race\npromoters Mike brumbaugh and Jake Wells\nis not just elevation but some Rowdy\nroads there's a couple spots of single\ntrack there was a new bit of two miles\nor so downhill that uh\ntested my meager skills even on a big\nbike like this relatively big bike is\nrelative right for a gravel race this is\na big bike\nand then there was the\nsection of really swoopy bermed out\nsingle track towards the end but most of\nthe race is on County roads on kind of\nrugged Jeep roads that like so much of\nColorado dirt roads how they run depends\non what the weather's been doing and\nthere were some parts where it was\npretty rotted out was pretty clear that\nthere had been some rain and some trucks\nor Jeeps had gone through and and dug in\nthere so that was you know added some\nfun and challenge\nso even though the race is only 75 miles\nI did not talk to a single person who\nwanted to go out and do more Michaela\nwho won said a couple points she was\ncrying it was so hard but true to what\nmakes her such a great racer she did not\nstop she just kept going harder and\nsmashed it as did\nhow he brought to one in the men's\ndivision so nice work to both of those\nfine Racers let's talk about this\nbicycle what's a gravel bike it's a bike\nyou ride on gravel today shifts the bike\ndu jour was this\nspecialized s-works epic which weighs a\nridiculous 20 pounds like fully built up\nlike with the pedals on and cages and\nand garment Mount and Garmin Etc\nfor context I put a giant Revolt X which\nhas a fork that's you know half of this\non the scale and that was over 22 pounds\nso lighter than a full suspension gravel\nbike I was on this because I bumped into\nchemo on Wednesday and I told him I was\ndoing this I said you ever had a\nmountain bike this course is so rugged I\nwould happily ride a mountain bike I\ndon't want a mountain bike he said hey\nyou want to borrow mine well yes yes I\ndo so that's exactly what I did and was\nhappy to have had that\na couple parts where it excelled uh part\nor two where it's not ideal where it\nexcelled was like obviously like the\nmore rugged bits we're having 100 ml of\nSquish felt nice having 2.3 inch tires\nat like 22 to 24 PSI felt great\nha\nuh also having a wee little gear of a 34\nI didn't know they made them gears that\nsmall 34 ring with a 50 in the back\nallowed me to creep very slowly but\nstill pedal up the the hiker bike\nsection which last year I absolutely\nwalked so I wasn't going quickly but I\nwas able to Pedal up that so that was\nthat was very nice\n10 minute walk from here\nyour mileage may vary\nit's at least metaphorically held\ndownhill\nI smell bacon I would love a bite of\nbacon yeah\nthank you sir yeah buddy enjoy sure\nhaving a little bit more of an upright\nposition means my back is not just\ndestroyed the way it was last year\nthe wee little gear of 34 10 or you know\nthat's the biggest gear here turns out\nyou can spin that out on a gradual\ndownhill so I spent a lot of time just\nyou know sitting on the top tube a good\nportion of it sitting behind my buddy\nMike lamb so thanks for towing me down\nthat paved bit Michael I appreciate you\nthis video is sponsored by Perk coffee\nthe good folks down in Savannah and\nAtlanta Brewing good coffee providing\nsome tall water bottles I filled these\nup\nmultiple times at the aid stations like\nso many gravel events volunteers make\nthese things run and it's you know great\nto see all the friendly faces out some\nfolks I haven't seen in years some folks\nI've ever seen it all getting water and\nscratching such topped off I'll make\nthat uh and just adds to the experience\nit makes it feasible really because\notherwise you'd have to be carrying like\na gallon and a half\nto keep yourself hydrated so thanks\nvolunteers we appreciate you thanks perk\nfor making this video possible I had\nsome of the instant coffee this morning\nat oh Dark Thirty at like 4 15 or\nwhatever the wake-up call was well\nbefore the coffee shop there the hotel\nopened so I just used the the coffee\nmaker in the hotel for hot water and\nmade some nice\nfresh instant coffee\ngot me going today if you want to save\n15 off Perk coffee use the code the ride\nat percoffee.com\nyeah yeah yeah yeah\nlike a lot of gravel races there's three\ndifferent distances here at Bighorn so\nwe can all get in where we fit in oh\nyou're all good man have fun\nright here next to uh skate park gypsum\nhas got a it's a little town but it's\ngot a lot of great facilities the\nrace finishes up right at the rec center\nthere's a nice grassy Park\nthe beer beer this way okay oh there's\nmy man then Delaney off the line\nnice finish\nafter I get done yapping at you here I'm\ngonna go take advantage of the showers\nin there it's beautiful town here in\nGypsum if you get a chance come and\ncheck it out\nand the view is okay I guess\nyeah yeah\nI mean if you're into that kind of thing\ntakeaways\nwhat what shall we learn from this what\nshall we take away from it well for me\none\nuse\na break block\nyou big\ndummy the other is you know whatever\nbike makes you comfortable is a great\nbike for gravel racing I work at fast\ncat coaching and Coach Elliott barring\nwho's a much better athlete and a\nsmarter individual than I am when\ntalking about gravel tires his wisdom is\nlike whatever Tire you're comfortable on\nthat's the tire you should run we've\nspent a lot of time you know getting\nourselves worked up about the perfect\ntire and the perfect pressure and yeah\nyes there are absolutely differences in\ntires but really like whatever you're\ncomfortable on\nis the best situation for you you know\nwhat works well for Howie what works\nwell for Michaela might not work so well\nfor the rest of us so being able to test\nout some different things uh I'm\nabsolutely a fan of doing so obviously\nwe can't oh\nbe chemo Seymour with these Sweet Bikes\nto test but if you can you know from a\nlocal bike shop or from your friends\nride a couple different options on a\nsimilar course to see what you like and\nthen that's where you should net out you\nknow testing bikes is kind of like\ntesting beer\n[Music]\nforeign\nat Unbound gravel Alexis was rocking the\nas of yet unreleased Santa Cruz Stigmata\nCC of course I asked her about it and of\ncourse she said she can't talk about it\nbut check out a video on that bike and\nthe bikes of some of the other hitters\nwho rounded out the men's and women's\npodiums\nas always I appreciate you watching I\nappreciate you subscribing I appreciate\nyou learning from my lessons and not\ndoing what I do but doing better\nand whatever bike you're riding whether\nit's a borrowed mountain bike or a road\nbike or a gravel bike or something in\nbetween get out there and enjoy the ride\nyay coasting\nbeen trying to catch my buddy Michael\nhere for like half an hour and I'm\nmaking\nto zero progress\ncoming up on\nten thousand feet",
