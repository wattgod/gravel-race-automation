          "transcript": "[Music]\nWe start our new season in the south of\nGermany in the mountains known as the\nBlack\nForest. From Fryborg, we started with\nour bikes and headed to the train\nstation. Hi enjoys a warm climate often\nconsidered one of the warmest in\nGermany. It is often referred as\nGermany's green city and it has many\ncycling paths and a strong public\ntransportation system.\nAfter a train ride up into the\nmountains, we arrived in\nTitiz. This town is located in the south\nof the Black Forest near Lake\nTis. Our goal was it to cycle around the\nlake on our bikes. And after that we\nplanned to cycle down the mountain back\nto\nPrywood. We could enjoy the view in the\nlake before the vacation season has\nbegun.\n[Applause]\nThe lake covers an area of nearby 1\nsquare kilometer.\nWe spontaneously decided to drive to\nLens about 6 kilometer away to make a\nshort visit to\nrelatives. Soon we realized that a steep\nclimb lay ahead.\n[Laughter]\nHeat. Heat.\nHeat.\nHeat up\nhere.\nHeat\nup here.\nOh my god.\nAfter a refreshment of a tasty beef\nsoup, we had to drive back the way we\ncame.\nHaving covered more kilometers and\naltitude meters than planned due in part\nto our extra two extension, we were\nlooking forward to a more relaxed\ndownhill ride.\nOn our drive down, we passed a\nremarkable cattle\nfarm. But we realized that there was\nstill another big climb between us and\nthe\nvalley. So we gathered all our strength\nand pedled as hard as we could.\nWhen we saw the highest mountain in the\nblack forest, the felt bag on the\nhorizon and there was more and more snow\nall around us, we wondered if we hadn't\nlost our\nway. But then finally came the highest\npoint of our route, which was actually\nnot very far from the felt bag.\nAnd from this point on, our route\nconsisted almost purely of a descent.\nup\nHeat up.\nThen we came to the river Tisam which\nflows through Fryborg and we knew we had\nmade it. It turned out to be a bigger\nadventure than we had expected, but\nthat's the joy of bike touring. We are\nexcited to see what else we will\nexperience this year. Maybe you'll join\nus on the next tour as well.",

Like\n\n- virtual bike training,\n- cycling workouts,\n- practicing mindfulness,\n- or just mental decompression.\n\nOr just want to bring their racing mind to a halt by being a silent, observing passenger for a couple minutes — be my guest.\n\nI Rejoined the biking party in 2022 after 15 years of absence. Due to all the positive effects I imagined the inspiration people could find in my videos as they first engage in nature cycling from the comfort of their homes, feeling the thrill of new landscapes and the tranquility of natural beauty. Maybe even starting sessions on their home trainer. Lastly I believe that you can find a very unique kind of such beauty on everyone's doorstep. You just have to want to see it. I hope these videos encourage you to start your very own endeavour.\n\nFor me cycling was not only about physical fitness but also for practicing mindfulness, offering a perfect blend of adventure and peace. Creating a consistent frame of time which allows your mind to wander and recover from mental load spikes you experience during the day. By sharing potentially vibrant experiences, I hope others to discover the beauty and diversity of our world, making every bike training session an exciting and mindful journey.",
