        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "65 miles hits the gravel sweet spot - long enough to hurt, short enough to survive poor pacing decisions. Pete Hitzeman describes the distance as delivering \"leg-shattering, lung-busting climbing\" while still being manageable for exploring Black Forest terrain without needing headlamps."

        "score": 2,

      "climate": {
        "score": 3,

      },
      "altitude": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Black Forest elevations won't challenge your red blood cell count - this isn't Colorado suffering at high altitude. The region's moderate elevations mean sea level lungs work fine, with the focus on rolling terrain rather than oxygen-depleting climbs."

      "adventure": {
        "score": 3,

      "prestige": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Third edition in 2026 means this event barely has training wheels off. No pro field or notable winners documented, and it's not mentioned alongside Unbound or SBT GRVL in gravel conversations. Olympic champion Michael Rich endorses the format, but field depth remains thin."
      },
      "race_quality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Registration opens December 1st with prize draws for jerseys and beer caps - always a red flag when the pre-race swag gets more marketing than the actual course details. No aid station info, no cutoff times, no surface breakdown available. Hard to deliver quality when the basics are still TBD."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "The Black Forest delivers adventure through Dreisamtal with riders praising \"breathtaking views of rural terrain\" and wildlife encounters. One rider noted the scenery was \"so breathtaking, I was beside myself\" despite challenging physical demands through dense forests."
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Event attracts \"Mountain Bikers, Gravel Grinders, Cyclocross Enthusiasts, Adventure Cyclists, and Fat Bike Fanatics\" with post-race festivities featuring \"Lagerfeuer, Smoker BBQ, hausgemachster Flammkuchen\" and vinyl music. Riders consistently praise volunteer support and grassroots organization."
      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Three years old with zero notable winners or pro participation documented. The prize structure revolves around gear giveaways instead of meaningful purse money. You're racing weekend warriors, not elite talent."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "€70 entry fee includes all food and drink at GenussHotSpots throughout the route, offering \"Black Forest tapas, barista coffee, ice cream, and Rothaus beer.\" The Black Forest location delivers substantial terrain value for 65 miles and 4500 feet of climbing."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Freiburg means German prices for lodging and food - your wallet will feel every euro. Michael Rich recommends \"wide tires for better comfort\" on the technical terrain, but no specific information on parking, nearest airports, or accommodation logistics available."
