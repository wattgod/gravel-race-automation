Justyna Jarczok describes '1400 km, constant confusion about which country you are currently in (4 to choose from), night river crossings' across four nations. Getting to rural Czech Republic for an unsupported 1,400km adventure remains largely your problem to solve."

        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "The actual race is 1,400km with 25,000m elevation, not the listed 65 miles. Justyna Jarczok notes 'The first 50km were also a small elimination race. A small group quickly got away from the front, and the winners came out of that group.' She finished in 124 hours and 58 minutes, becoming the first woman to complete it."

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Justyna Jarczok describes 'singletrack riding, enduro trail descents, numerous hike & bike rides, hour-long walks with pushing the bike' through dense forests. One rider compared steep ramps to 'the Old Soviet Road at the Silk Road Mountain Race.' Technical enough to force mechanicals and DNFs, but mixed with gravel roads."

      "elevation": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Total 25,320m over 1,400km averages 18m gain per kilometer—not crushing by mountain standards. Daily segments range 1,000-4,230m, with meaningful climbs through Bohemian Forest and Jizerske mountains. Respectable elevation for the distance, but not the defining challenge of this route."
      },
      "climate": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Early September weather delivers serious challenges. During 2020 scouting, riders faced 'temperatures dropping to lower single digits,' putting 'plastic bags in our shoes and plastic gloves on our hands trying to keep them from freezing.' Snow appears at high points even in September, adding unpredictable suffering to the adventure."
      },
      "altitude": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "No specific altitude data provided, but route stays in Central European highlands, not true high mountains. Bohemian Forest and Jizerske mountains are respectable hills, not oxygen-debt territory. Altitude isn't a factor in this challenge—it's all about distance and weather exposure."
      },
      "adventure": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Four countries, national parks, UNESCO sites, and complete self-reliance should scream adventure. But adventure requires more than just hard miles—it needs uncertainty, discovery, genuine risk. This feels more like a very long training ride with pretty scenery than a true adventure challenge that transforms you."
      },
      "prestige": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "This is a newish ultra that emerged from COVID-delayed scouting trips in 2020-2021, so it hasn't had time to build legendary status. The bikepacking community calls it a 'monster of a route' and it's listed on major adventure sites, but there's zero data on past winners or notable finishers. Hard to be prestigious when nobody knows who's actually conquered your 1,400km beast."
      },
      "race_quality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "The 1,400km route through four countries hits UNESCO sites and delivers adventure, but organization remains bare-bones. One rider had to 'fix my derailleur hanger' in Cesky Krumlov mid-race. With DNF rates over 50% and mechanicals forcing riders onto 'fixed gear,' the route quality exceeds the event infrastructure."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Crossing borders multiple times through Bohemian-Saxon Switzerland, Czech Canada's extreme climate zones, and UNESCO Telč delivers genuine adventure. Scouts gushed about 'those trails, the views, the people, the culture' despite aborting due to weather and COVID emergencies. The route promises legitimate suffer-beauty, even if the event structure is minimal."
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Pavel Novotný describes returning 'felt like a family reunion, with plenty of familiar faces, yet an opportunity to forge new friendships.' The atmosphere was 'very international, naturally inviting to share cycling stories' with 'dot-watching the participants arrive at the finish in camp one by one, cheered on by the campers.'"
      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Zero data on field size, past results, or competitive depth. This attracts the bikepacking ultra crowd who treat 1,400km unsupported as a personal challenge, not a race. When your main selling point is 'don't underestimate this monster,' you're fishing for survivors, not speedsters."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Related Bash events run 250€ for multi-day packages with lodging and meals, suggesting reasonable pricing for a week-long adventure. You're getting 1,400km of curated routing through four countries plus the post-race camp experience. Decent value if you survive to enjoy the beer."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Central Europe travel costs plus a week-long commitment adds up fast. Being completely unsupported means carrying all your gear and food, but also means no mid-race hotel bills. No clear airport logistics or accommodation strategy provided, so you're figuring out international travel to rural Czech Republic on your own."
