          "transcript": "[Music]\nlet's do\nit at this race is stough I fell I don't\nknow how many\ntimes of course in the toughest moments\nmy friends they cheap I travel from the\nNetherlands to Czech Republic to tackle\nmy first solo off-road Ultra race\nBohemian border Bash one of the toughest\nself-supported off-road races in the\nworld 1,300 km and 24,000 M of climbing\nfollowing the Asian Borderlands of the\nBohemian\nvia so we are here at the Bohemian\nborder Bash Camp let's see how it\ngoes yeah excited and a bit scared to be\nhonest my first Offroad race not a\nmechanical expert or gravel Rider but uh\nlet's see how it goes I have the feeling\nthere will be a lot of\ndrama it starts here at the csite and\nnow time for dinner here are the cabins\nwhere there's some of the writers are\nsaying pre-ra\ndinner good morning race day uh it's\nvery humid and uh I don't know what to\nexpect somebody said a lot of animals\nalready on the way so it's going to be\nan\nadventure let's do\nit\nhere we go first\nK the start of the race was very fast\nwith tarmac sections and light gravel\nRiders were fighting for position and of\ncourse you had to defend your space on\nthe trail there were a lot of twist and\nturns so it was a bit tricky to find a\nway sometimes\nhiking\ngrass making\nprogress 142 km on the way to checkpoint\none\nnot\nsure so beautiful this area I must say\nthe road is really\nbeautiful\nso maybe to checkpoint\none got the stamp now the fun start the\nfun part starts checkpoint\nto after cp1 which was a village the\nfield was more spread out I managed to\nget there during daylight and I took my\nstamp and decided to continue to get to\ncp2 at\nnight so just did check\n.1 let's\nsee Ultra\nsunris just when you need it they put\nsome\nfood before\nthis oh\noh wow magical\nSunset but this race is tough I fell I\ndon't know how many\ntimes good night is midnight made it\nto I'm going to have a nap and\ncontinue I'm a bit tired cp1 to cp2 was\na dense forest by the time I arrived to\ncheckpoint 2 was at night but before it\nthere was the ghost checkpoint so you\ncould sleep there there there were some\nRiders asleeping there taking a nap and\nI decided to take a 3 hours nap before\ncontinuing to cp2 which was a rock in\nthe middle of nowhere in the mountains\nand there was a long hike a bike to\nit checkpoint to in the middle of the\nnight very challenging with this hio\nbike\nanother checkpoint I was there in the\nmiddle of the night alone in the forest\nand I was so scared it was my first time\nalone in the forest riding my bike but I\nmanaged to find kind of a trail I did\ndidn't know what it was because you\ncouldn't see anything I was like okay\njust follow the\nline good morning day two o really\nexhausted let's\n[Applause]\nsee that's what you have to\ndamn I don't know how much walking I'm\ndoing today but it's more walking than\nriding\nthat on a gravel bike\nno\noh exhausted I don't know not many\nplaces to resupply on Germany during\nSunday\ncheckpoint two no\nthree again in the\nnight now in the area of the Bohemian\nForest I spent all day trying to catch\nup to the first lady Ursula and I\nactually bump into her in one of the hio\nby sections and she was super nice we\nhad a quick shot but I decided to make\nmy move and try to be first at the third\ncheckpoint after a few hours I finally\nreach it now I'm going to look for a\nhotel and decided to take a long\nsleeping break of 6 hours and I got\novertaken by her again and other Riders\nso when I woke up I was like okay back\nto the chase morning day\nthree my son Sherry Sherry lady oh\nFrozen I just came down from the\nmountains I was like so\nhumid gets into your hands all the\nhumidity and it's so cold from a gas\nstation having a coffee and trying to\nrecover movement in my house I'm warming\nup shopping on the day on the gas\nstation even for a 7 Day C this St and\nof course\nhar\nremoving the layers from the\nnight\nyou have a lot of hats and places to\nstay seems that there are somebody had\nchampagne I mean\ndamn the beauty of ultra cycling you see\nplaces like\nthis\nI got out of the trail and then all of\nthe sudden I saw a lot of people with\nselfie sticks and I was like okay there\nmust be something amazing here and I\narrived to the cp4 so it was the UNESCO\nheritage site of a sesy KL super\nbeautiful medieval city and there was a\nbike store so I decided to stop there to\nrepair my derailer hunger I spent all\nday with only three gears and resupply\non as much shells as I could carry\nhi a\ncheckpoint checkpoint stum\nah\ncheckpoint is this the\ncheckpoint at a bik shop I crash in the\nm in the trail so I bent my derailer\nlet's see it's not shifting well I'm\ntrying to see if they can repent it and\nfind the St because I can't don't find\nit checko three or four I\nthink\nof course so hiking again day\nthree keep on hiking and avoiding Ultra\nHCK using the aerob bars to dry your\nbeep\nshs making progress made it to gumon now\ntrying to resupply\nWood\nnow the route follows the eurell Iron\nCurtain let's\nsee wow so beautiful all the time ups\nand downs but today is really not in\ngeneral about the\nhike\ncheckpoint five trying to find the stump\nalways difficult so beautiful\nhere I continue from uh cp4 to cp5 which\nwas again in the Bohemian Forest in the\nmountains it was super nice beautiful\nbetween Germany Czech Republic and\nAustria finally make it to checkpoint 5\nthat was a monument of the Iron Curtain\nso you could see a lot of remains of the\nprevious border the Iron Curtain it was\nvery\ninteresting wow orange\nsunset\nthat's what you deal with that night\nDam want a place to stay for tonight\nafter checkpoint 5 I decided to continue\nit was the longest stretch between\ncheckpoints from cp5 to cp6 so 232\nkilomet in between them and I decided to\nstop in a pension at night and had a\nreally nice dinner and again few hours\nof sleep was uh super\ncool grass riding BM to a\nfriend oh we got lost in the\ntrail sometimes you bump into lost\npeople how is he going man good morning\num making progress and um now let's\nsee step by step but Offroad is very\ndifferent day four more hiking than\nbiking in other points of the agenda\nafter grass riding full of plants does\nhe make it more\nwhat do you\nthink made it to checkpoint\n6 always when you think it's not it's\nnot going to be bad then there is a hike\na bike and then you lose all your\nschedule but making progress Slowly by\nsurely mash\nresupplying 20 gels or\nmore after the checkpoint trying to fix\nmy bike and resupply let's\nsee checkpoint six was the scratching\npoint it was the last time to scratch\nfrom the race because then you head\ntowards the high mountains in more\nremote area but I was like no I'm going\nto continue again I bent my derail your\nhanger so I sto in a bike shop to repair\nit and resupply on gels again before\nheading to the Eagle\nMountains again magical\nsunsets\ncheckpoint 7 I think in the\nnight managed to reach cp7 at night I'm\nmon of the soldier in the middle of the\nmountains again and I was like okay time\nto continue because I have to make it to\nPoland to try to find a hotel where to\nstay and I actually managed to overtake\nthe first lady when she was sleeping she\nstopped before cp7 in a village and I\ncontinued towards Poland funa hotel and\ndecided to take a few hours of sleep\nbecause I knew the next day would be\nclimbing up up up up up towards the\nhighest peak so yeah a tough one\ngood morning de five in Poland in the\nmountains the most beautiful\nsunrise wow feeling\ngood\nDes sending an actual River bed happy I\nhave\nsuspension\nso you have the stamps for to sell\nvalidate in some checkpoints like this\ncp8\nso Supermarket break\nretired I mean literally you have to\npush your bike over a bound seriously\nare you kidding me guys\ntime for hiker bike there was a\nsuper steep hiking section so I decided\nto use my hiker bike strap I brought it\nwith me so I could mount it on my bike\nand put my bike on my bike\nfinally making some progress after\nfalling several\ntimes the way up to cp9 was really tough\nI spent all day climbing up hiking it\nwas really tough to reach the highest\npeak of Czech Republic 1,600 M of\nelevation and I start seeing ski slopes\nand it got really cold and I was like oh\nmy God I have to make it out of here\nbefore the night because it's going to\nbe freezing\nyeah that's for skiing the highest peak\nbrutal of course in the toughest moments\nmy friends they\ncheap\ncheckpoint on let's do\ntough work too hard for this view to let\nit V go wow so I managed to go up and\ndown on the same day and I reached cp10\nin the middle of the night which was a\nriver bed super\nhumid CP\n11 no 10 now to our CP\nthe bridge\ncollapsed after the river you had to\ncross a bridge but the bridge collaps\nand I was like no it can't be true what\ndo I do so I decided to take my High\nbike strap and just cross the broken\nbridge cp1 Jesus Christ the\nhumidity and I decided to pull my trump\ncar not to sleep at all during that\nnight I slept all of other nights but I\nknew urula was on The Chase so I wanted\nto have a chance a shot to win the race\nand I continue riding through the\nnight and that's why I brought the hiab\ntrp much\nfaster it\nwork the last kilometers are always the\ntoughest I was like okay you have to\nkeep on going there's uh somebody on the\nChase and I bumped into one of the other\nRiders and

          "transcript": "morning hope you're doing really well\nnow i know i always start off my videos\nby saying how very excited i am about my\nplans for the day that's because i love\nbikes but today more excited than most\nbecause i've actually left england so\ni'm in the czech republic at an event\ncalled bohemian border dash camp or\nbohemian border camp it's a gravel camp\nand it sounds and looks really really\nfun a lot of the rides you do with other\npeople there are kind of challenges\nwithin the rides that determine the\nroute that you take next they put on\nlunches they put on bands and djs\nthere's campfires there's talks actually\ni'm doing a campfire talk and it's sunny\nand i'm not in england so it's gonna be\nreally fun i'll tell you more about it\nas i go along possibly i do always say\nthat and then i always forget to tell\nyou more about stuff but anyway just\ncome along for the day it's going to be\ngreat\nhow cool is this it's pretty cool it's\nkind of like\nrustic\nso\nmy little bunk\nsharing with another woman over here\nobviously giant bike box had to get\nsqueezed in\nit's very nice there's a really\nnice vibe about it\n[Music]\n[Applause]\ni'm so excited to ride i've never been\nhere before and when we drove in last\nnight god it looks beautiful i'm just\ngoing to nip my bike over to the kind\npeople at sram who are going to give it\na once-over also i wanted to check out\nthe new explore fork that they've got\nset up on some bikes over there you know\nthe suspension fork that they brought\nout for gravel bike hopefully they are\ngoing to send one to the uk when i get\nhome so that'll be fun also the dropper\npost\nokay so it's nearly time to go but what\nwe have to do first is answer a bunch of\ndaft questions similar to well it's not\nsimilar to an alley cat because actually\nin alicat you're racing through the city\nnormally on a breakfast track bike and\nyeah it's very different but the point\nis sometimes on alley cats you used to\nhave to do challenges to get the\nlocation of the next checkpoint or\nwhatever so we have to answer a bunch of\nquestions and then they'll tell us the\nfirst part of the route off we go and i\nthink we do that several times today\nit's just a nice way of\nexploring this new area meeting some new\npeople i guess and well just generally\nhaving fun and who doesn't like that\ni'm not cheating honestly it's 19 months\nreagan is relying on me to navigate what\ncould possibly go wrong\nthese forest\ngravel roads are just\nperfect\nif you've spent time riding where i ride\nin england\nthis is just\nwell this is what the roads are like the\nactual roads\nwe are at what appears to be the first\nkind of challenge game sort of thing and\nbefore i set off i was thinking this\nsounded really fun\nnow i'm here i'm like i just want to\nride my bike\nwow\nso far\nnothing super technical\nbut a fair amount of climbing\nnice thing is though\nit means there's some fun descents\nthat follow all those climbs\nand it is hot hot hot\ndrenched in sweaty\nan extra day of sun\nafter the summer we've had\nis so very welcome also\nit's been a piss it down all day\ntomorrow so\ni'm loving this soaking it up\nyes that's my teammate so this is the\nwtb challenge and then i've just been\ntold that the next stop is lunch\napparently i'm the first person to\ncomplain that the next stop is lunch but\nit's just so beautiful here the trails\nare amazing i'm riding\ni'm not in england the sun is shining\nyeah i mean that's why i don't want to\nstop and eat some lunch but anyway let's\ngo\nthis is so cool so\nso cool\nokay so we just rode past this place and\nreagan has suggested that we stop for a\nradler aka\nsports beer it's rattler mean cyclist in\ngermany yeah far right it's the beer you\ndrink when you're cycling exactly it is\na cyclist beer so i mean i couldn't say\nno really could i\nwell\ncould i just point out that bregen said\nlet's get a small rattler\num\nthank you this is the small one do you\nsee the big blast that's the big one\nright i did get the small\ncheers\nthis ride is so chilled it's so nice\nthere is a 300 kilometer race going on\nat the same time as we're doing this and\ni had the option of doing that race but\nit's a self-supported i don't know if\nit's self-navigated or if there's a\nroute that you have to follow but anyway\nessentially i figured i didn't want to\ncome all the way to this awesome\nsounding gravel camp and then ride\nentirely on my own for 300 kilometers so\ni decided to do\nthe fun stuff i mean not that a 300\nkilometer race wouldn't be fun\nwell maybe it wouldn't be but anyway i\ndecided to do\nthe fun parts where i get to hang out\nwith friends drink sports beer and stop\nfor lunch and just enjoy the scenery so\ni'm not regretting that choice at all\nright now\ndefinitely one of the nicest bits of the\nride and there have been a lot of nice\nbits i actually think that\nthis is one of one of the best places\ni've ever ridden gravel\nseriously it's\nphenomenal\nall right\nokay so we're back and there is one\nfinal challenge from the guys at camp so\nyou have to\ntry and put this tent up as quickly as\npossible and the person who's up does it\nfastest\nwins obviously my competitive side has\nimmediately come out i want to win this\ntent\ncome on\ni didn't win the tent\ntired check these out by the way\na little present from strava how cool\nare they\nanyway so i'm gonna have a shower and\nput these on and then tonight i'm doing\na round the campfire talk for sram\ntalking about bike packing and gravel\nracing so that should be fun i don't\nthink i'm going to take you guys along i\nthink i'm going to say bye bye for now i\nam very very hot and sweaty anyway adios\ni'm going to see you later\nyou",
