        "explanation": "5000 feet over 62 miles delivers consistent work without massive climbing blocks. The rolling profile with ridgeline connections means you're always going up or down, but nothing suggests monster climbs that separate the field. Alabama's steep, direct descents into creek crossings provide the most elevation drama. Less climbing than The Mid South.

Similar climate challenges to SBT GRVL."

Starting elevation and max elevation are unreported, but this isn't mountain territory—it's rolling piedmont that won't challenge anyone's oxygen intake. Altitude is completely irrelevant to this race experience. Lower altitude than Gravel Worlds — no thin-air concerns."

Mud logjams forced walking sections in 2024, and riders report confusion about state crossings due to twists that obscure the border theme. Aid station details are vague, cutoff times unknown, and the course suffers from identity issues between being a border battle and scenic tour."

      "experience": {
        "score": 3,

Riders enjoy the remote scenic views and appreciate how the 30 miles of paved connectors blend the sectors intelligently. The mud chaos and terrain variety make for memorable war stories, even if the 'border war' theme gets lost in the twists."

          "description": "The VTXL is a 300 mile gravel route that spans the state of Vermont, from its northern border with Canada to its southern border with Massachusetts. For a small state, it packs a punch, as it's more than 90% gravel and delivers unrelenting climb after climb (after climb after climb after climb...).\n\nTed King was the first person to ride this route in 2021 as an all out assault, pushing his limits without stopping in a single 24 hour period. Hundreds of others have taken on the route in a more traditional bikepacking adventure over anywhere from two days to a week. Still others have since taken Ted's crown as the fastest known time, the FKT, as the time has ticked ever lower. \n\nNow with the record setting time remaining the same for more than a year, Ted thought he would give it a crack to take back his home-state gravel ultra. \n\nPresented by ​⁠@zippspeed on their 303 SW with additional support from ​⁠@ReneHerseCycleson their Poteau Mountain tires; see how the equipment stands up over this sub-22 hour ride.\n\nFull ride here: https://www.strava.com/activities/15769370615\n\n\nVideo production by ​⁠www.ChrisMilliman.com",

          "transcript": "I've wanted to come back and do another\nFKT. Go. You're pedaling fraction of\nwhat you were to start. If I'm not going\nto take the FKT, then then I feel like\nthe selfishness of being out on this\nride in the first place, of being away\nfrom my family, it just feels like it\nall is a little bit feudal. You realize\nyou can't quit.\nJust over my shoulder is the Canadian\nborder. We're at the northern terminus\nof the state of Vermont. We're about to\nstart the VTXL,\nwhich is a 300 mile gravel route that\nspans the entire state of Vermont,\nending up southern part of the state,\nnorthern Massachusetts. The current\nfastest known time is 21 hours 51\nminutes 31 seconds. It is approaching\n900 p.m., so I've got a very, very big\nday in store. And the hope at the end of\nit all is to take the FKT.\nI was trying to pull this off relatively\nlast minute in August and I was trying\nto do that courtesy of some good\nweather, longer daylight, but then it\nended up a being smoked out with some\nCanadian wildfire and b just stiflingly\nhot like up in the '9s. And then with\nreally nice weather here, it's you lose\nsomething by being in September and not\nhaving the full advantage of all\ndaylight like you get in mid June.\nHope everything's going to be a little\nbit ahead of schedule.\nSo almost factor in like an extra half\nhour or more.\n&gt;&gt; Time doesn't move linearly. Initial few\nhours you were just riding on this\nendorphin high. It's simple to ride with\nyour blinders on because you are riding\nonly into the light that you are casting\nas opposed to during the day. You know,\nyou see what's all around you 360°. It\ntakes a mental toll later on into the\nride that you are only able to ride into\nthis tunnel that you're producing. It\nwas a little more challenging\nwith two river crossings that involved\nwalking through streams.\nUm, and\nsome\nuh jettisoning bottles with\nuh what do you call it? Washboard.\nLike I have my warmest everything.\nAlready reaching for the salty takis.\n&gt;&gt; 15 and 30 is 45 miles. three\nodd is almost 4 hours but\n&gt;&gt; 3 to four hours\n&gt;&gt; you feel like you're riding another\ndimension in a way you're not near\npeople\nyou're not near anything that's\nhappening you're just sort of operating\nin your own little island\n&gt;&gt; I did a lot of hallucinating things\nappear but everything leaves or\nsquirrels and all sorts of rodents like\nactual leaves falling just looked like\nrodents I saw you guys all the time when\nyou weren't there I saw our white van\nall the time when it wasn't there. So\nthat was a little bit trippy\n[Music]\nand yeah, the road conditions were it's\nlike they're grading everything. Take\nout the road grader, it's just slow as\nmolasses to push your bike through it.\nI'm glad I was on some big 48s.\nThe end of nighttime was getting a\nlittle touch and go. Yeah, that was\nbrisk.\nNighttime is definitely hard\nwhere your mind is doing all sorts of\nsummer salts.\nThat's a funny thing, too, because I've\nwanted to do this for for years, and\nwhen you're at home thinking about it\nand plotting it and planning it, you're\nlike, \"Okay, you know what? It's really\nfun ride. It's a beautiful ride. So\nwhether or not you get the FKT, it's all\nright. It's a beautiful day out.\" But\nthen you think about all that is\ninvested in it, the scouting the course\nand planning the route and getting\npeople to be benevolent with their time\nto drive you around. Yeah, pointto-point\nrides are challenging on their best\ndays.\nWell, it appears to me that we're\nactually quite close\non time with the previous record.\nSo,\nit has me thinking.\nSo, basically limiting stops is the name\nof the game\nbecause at this point in the day, of\ncourse, you start to feel a little bit\ntired\nfor obvious reasons.\nThat's the way go.\nSpeed was great in the first 100 miles.\nIt definitely dropped in that second\n100. So, at that point, I'm like, well,\nI'm kind of chasing an average speed\nknowing that 147 is the give or take\nrace winning time. So, when I was down\nin 144s, 143 threes, I was thinking,\nwhat on earth am I doing? As much as a\nsecond is a second, a minute a minute,\nan hour is an hour. My goodness, time\ngets warped and bent and moves in really\nmysterious ways over the course of\nsomething that you know is only going to\ntake sub 22 hours. 10 minutes can feel\nlike an hour and an hour can feel like\n10 minutes.\n&gt;&gt; It's a mental test as much as anything.\nWhen you see your speed dropping and\nyou're doing everything in your power\nand you know that every pedal stroke\nonly has you 100,000 pedal strokes until\nyou you're finished. It's like it just\nfeels like such a drop in the bucket.\nThe back of my eyes hurt. I'm so\nfreaking tired. Just like sleepy.\nProbably not slept in.\nUh 20\n30 hours.\n&gt;&gt; Oh my gosh.\nYou literally fall asleep like this\nright now.\nIt's like claustrophobic inducing. You\ndon't know what to do. I was eating very\nwell. Equipment was great. So, it's just\nlike, what on earth are you supposed to\ndo?\nFor many hours today, I thought, \"Oh\ngosh, what a bummer. I'm not even going\nto get close.\"\nIt's almost like the less you think, the\nmore you're able to to enjoy the moment.\nIt's like you've you've reached the\ndepths of how bad each pedal stroke is\ngoing to hurt and then you just plug\nalong pedal stroke after pedal stroke\nand don't think or calculate how many\nit's going to take because it's a very\nlong time after the final climb into the\ninto the final rolling bits. It's like I\ndon't know how or why, but I I felt kind\nof good. good enough to take along at,\nyou know, in the low 20s, 23, 24 mph. To\nlook back 100 miles pre previously where\nI felt like I was in the depths of\ndespair, hardly able to average 14 mph.\nI don't know where that second wind\ncomes from. It's knowing that I'm close\nto the finish. I know that I can push a\nthe final bit. How motivated are you to\nturn the pedals over? It's going to hurt\nafter a certain point, but it's only\ngoing to hurt that same amount. It\ndoesn't hurt more or less. I mean, man,\nthis course is just so relentless.\nEven to the last climb, every time I do\nit, I get to this exact point and I'm\nlike, h,\n&gt;&gt; oh my\ngoodness.\nPrevious FKT 21 hours 51 minutes 31\nseconds. My in reach, which is still\nrolling, is 21 hours 17 minutes and I\nprobably finished 2 minutes ago. So,\ncall it 215. Taking a half hour plus off\nthe previous\ntime,\nwhich I won't lie, was a bit of a\na bit of a surprise. I am absolutely\nexhausted. The last time I slept was\n6:00 a.m. 2 days ago. I'm very pleased\nto have picked up the speed in the\nfinale to make it all worthwhile.\nIt's hard not to say this is not the\nbest part of my day.\nNot just any Takis. Fuego.",

kind of\nstarted doing these like little little\ntrips um and these trips got longer and\nthen when I got my first job and my\nfirst P or like my first real job and my\nfirst real paycheck I was like I'm going\nto get a road Pi cuz it's I don't know\nit made sense and so I got my road bike\nand then it was just like\nclick I definitely ride it to get away\nfrom a lot of my thoughts and a lot of I\ndon't know things that are going\non in my day that might not necessarily\nmake me feel so good um so yeah riding a\nbike is is an escape I ride it to escape\nboy never wants to be beaten by a girl\nso you can they will always fight for it\nwith girls it's it's in some communities\nis becomes more like a social thing and\nnot that much training but I'm really\ntrying to like this is good TR yeah\nchanged that in some ways because I\nthink girl can train together too it\ndoesn't always have to be like social\nrights and so but training rights is a\nthing and\nthey thank you where can\nI make friendships that I would have\nnever been able to make anyways uh I\nwould have never been able to to\nmake off the bike people I would have\nnever come across\num so cycling is just something that is\nkind of a large part of my\nidentity and um has really helped be a\nplatform to kind of push me into New\nOpportunities and new places and um new\nexperiences that's probably I thought\nabout that last night when I up\nchill\nthere we'll get one is funny but\nthen I try to actually focus on the pain\nand and\nnot talk myself out of what I'm feeling\nlike I I try to not disregard what I'm\nphysically feeling and actually accept\nthat it's happening and not to move past\nit but to just be like yes this is\npainful because I've tried the like oh\nit's it's fine like just just keep going\nlike you're okay and like that doesn't\nhelp me so it's just acknowledging like\nthis is hard this hurts maybe deal a\nlittle bit\nwalk love about cycling the most is that\nyou can just like push yourself so far\nand um yeah that's but like something\nthat would make me Crack I don't know\nit's bad mechanical can't ride can't\nfinish can't finish because of something\nthat's out of my control I think that\nthat would just that would be a bad day\non a\n[Applause]\nbike I just have to go faster right like\nthat's all I need to do is just tle fast\njust started a ride thinking this was\ngoing to be\nhard and then you push yourself\nand knowing that you gave it your all\nand that you're crap like you're so\nmentally and physically burnt out at the\nend of the\nday is nice cuz then you know you gave\nit you're all I think I'm upset when I\nend a ride feeling good or maybe not\nfeeling as tired\nbecause then I go back to being like I\nthat one little bit I should have maybe\npushed more or\nand today I did my longest climb ever\nand I and I didn't know what to expect\nand I have never ridden so many uh\nmeters of\nelevation insane I have never been\nriding that much so to\nlike achieve new stuff like that is\nsuper important to me because that means\nlike you're moving in a\ndirection it's wild to think that\nsomeone would approach the stage as a\nstage seven because it was my second day\nhere of riding um and I think I woke up\nI think we had slept nicely and um I\nwasn't sure what to expect because it's\na long day and I know the climbs were\ntough but I kind of feel like I um can\nhave the legs for a longer\nclimb when you\nclimb and then when you get to the top\nyou just you're done and then it likeit\nyou don't about the\nit sucks but\ndon't as a woman to try and look at the\nmen and compare yourself like you can't\ncompare yourself to the men you just\ncan't we're I'm accepting the fact that\nwe're not built the same and that I\ncan't have necessarily the same numbers\nas them but to then see a woman on TV or\nin person and seeing them push and being\nlike you know maybe I like that gives me\nmore of a drive on my bike CU I'm like I\nsaw a woman do it so it's doable I can\ndo it um versus like a man you're like\nyeah he's strong for sure that number is\ncrazy I don't know if I can get that\nmaybe like it's that maybe that I don't\nlike I like seeing a woman who's hitting\na number and being like that's a crazy\nnumber that she just hit\nbut she's a woman and I'm a woman and I\ncan relate more and and\nyeah\nhey\nreally what I'm trying not to think\nabout tomorrow but I think um I think\nwe'll all try to work together the best\nwe can to make sure everyone finishes\nthe day and um I think it will be pretty\nemotional perhaps again at the hilltop\nfinish I mean why\nnot um but I'm really looking forward to\nseeing what my body can do\ntomorrow it's a beautiful time and it\nit's steady it's like the grade doesn't\nfluctuate a lot so you can just yeah\nit's so nice\nyeah oh\nI know that at the end of that ride I'll\nprobably\nfeel the best that I've ever felt and I\nthink that's the addiction to cycling is\nthe Suffering The wondering why I\ncycle the the constant argument you have\nwith yourself on your bike of the finish\nand and looking back on what you just\ndid I think anyone who finishes a ride\nthat they were maybe a little nervous to\ndo is like the greatest feeling",

scaling\nmountain passes\nbut every year there are fewer and fewer\nfor us to explore\nsnuffed out by the development of the\nmodern world or simply forgotten in\nfavor of smoother and more comfortable\ntravel\nbefore they wither away these wonders\nstill have Beauty to give us\nand they must be enjoyed before it is\ntoo late\n[Music]\nthis right in front of our motorcycles\nis the eastern border of Wyoming 500\nmiles that way is the Western border and\nZach and I have decided to try to get\nfrom here to there riding only on dirt\nroads the reason we chose wide open\nWyoming aside from the vicious and cold\nheadwind is that we were told 90 of the\nroads in this state are made of either\ndirt or gravel figured that would help\nour chances still that means navigating\naround and under major highways across\nrivers and reservoirs through fence\nlines private property who knows\nbattling the cold yeah and to make the\nwhole Adventure even more of a challenge\nwe're doing it on these dual Sports of\nyesteryear we have a 1975 XL 350 in a\n1969 dt1 these are two of the original\nDual Sport Motorcycles and they're bikes\nthat have been conquered in roads like\nthis for a lot longer than that had been\nalive it's an old school dual sport\nShowdown across the wild west two-stroke\nversus four-stroke and the Only Rule\nthat really matters here are aside from\nstaying warm Staying Alive is that these\ntires must not touch pavement\nI'm not gonna do it must not can't do it\npavement's lava is lava uh if only the\npavement were lava it would be warm\nwe could start a fire it'll be nice yeah\nit was almost certainly the coldest\nwindiest morning in Wyoming history\nit was also the first of many signs that\nmother nature didn't want us to succeed\nbut we were way too excited about our\nbikes to get the message\nWest dude let's go\nmy good friend here are you heading here\nrebuilt these motorcycles over the past\nweek or two\nand uh I have the utmost faith that they\nwill go the distance ah yeah well uh it\nwas kind of a scramble to get him ready\nin time so it's not like I went through\nhim with the fine-tooth comb definitely\nsome teething problems uh dt1 refuses to\nuse third gear I'm not really sure why\nplus man this thing freaking vibrates\nlike crazy you get some tingle in your\ntaint there yeah I think uh aside from\nthe obvious patina and the sort of like\nslopping some of the joints the thing\nthat I find interesting about this bike\nin particular is how tiny the tank feels\nit feels like you're on this tiny little\nkid's bike and then the handlebar is\nsuper super wide\nit's very interesting and not modern\nfeel to the cockpit for sure yeah I mean\ncompared to Modern dual Sports they're\ndefinitely small and narrow and the seed\nHeights are crazy low compared to almost\nanything you would buy nowadays\nyeah that's interesting actually like\nthe front of motorcycles have gotten\nwider because of you know liquid cooling\nand radiators and that kind of thing and\nthe seats have turned into friggin two\nby fours whereas this is pretty plush I\ngotta say\nwe'll see if I'm singing that song in a\nfew days\nthank you\nyeah\nlook out guys Stampede\nyou don't like the shadow two-stroke\noh I don't hit that concrete gotta hit\nthe dirt you're right thank you for\ninviting me\nWyoming is home to some 12 000 miles of\ndirt roads\ncrisscrossing the landscape in every\ndirection\nluckily we are very good at reading Maps\nthere are dotted lines that are pretty\nclearly these well-traveled dirt roads\nand then there are these thin red lines\nthat cut across Open Country and it's\ndifficult to tell in our research how\nwell they were going to work to be\nhonest but imagine that they don't have\nGoogle Street View out here so this is\nthe first potential shortcut that we can\ntake on these uh somewhat questionable\nroads\nwhat's ever gone wrong on a shortcut am\nI right\noh\nthis is good we're learning a lesson\nhere the road literally ends into\na cornfield\nnow there's definitely no Road over\nthere either\nwe probably should spend too much time\nflirting with people's corn fields this\nis when the shotguns come out yeah all\nright well let's go back to the main\nroad and uh carry on\napparently our 27 map was a little less\nthan 100 accurate but we figured as long\nas we stuck to the major dirt roads\neverything would be fine\noh good lord\nthis is an unexpected piece of pavement\nthis is not on our researched route we\nthought it was just gonna be dirt all\nthe way across\nwe talked about lots of options to\npotentially you know you build a jump\nover you tunnel under but uh we've come\nup with something that I think you'll\nagree is as beautiful as it is simple\none two three oh my God\nyeah the sideways\nthere you go swing them legs yeah turn\nthem hips yeah\noh my God\nmaybe building a job isn't such a bad\nidea\none weighs about as much as a modern\ndirt bike and was still difficult to\ncarry one two three\nwow the XL 350 weighs almost 100 pounds\nmore and that was before Zach loaded it\nup with his camping gear and various\nbeard lotions\nwow\nwhat a ridiculous way to travel\nokay apparently it was a 100 map that\nwas 27 accurate\nwithin the first few hours of riding we\nhad only covered about 75 miles\nand compressed half a dozen vertebrae\ncarrying the bikes across a multi-lane\nInterstate just wasn't going to work\nso we looked for a more appropriate\noption\nmajor highway my friend\nlook at this they made it for sheep and\ncattle but uh it's gonna allow our iron\nhorses to cross under this highway well\nwe are animals of a certain type right\nnow\nthis is pretty cool\nmy motorcycle sounds awesome in a tunnel\nwith the sweet nectar of road crossing\nsuccess fresh on our tongues morale was\nhigh\nhowever daylight was fading quickly and\nthe weather was about to take a nasty\nturn so we've done about I don't know\n110 miles so far today and\nthe sun is due to set behind this storm\ncloud any minute uh so we're basically\njust looking for a place to pitch our\ntents tonight\nthis is our last paved Road of the day\nlooks like there's a little Bridge\nZach's gonna see you can poke under it I\nalso suggested that perhaps we might\nwant to sleep under it since we have no\nfreaking clue where we're gonna pitch\nour tents tonight\nforeign\nlook at this oh yeah it's pretty pretty\nPleasant this is a pretty good spot to\ncamp\nwhen you get yourself into weird\nsituations sometimes\nreally strange Solutions I'm like the\nbest ones no no it's when you plan\npoorly and don't know where you're gonna\nsleep\nthat you have to start making desperate\ndesperate decisions\nit's definitely colder out here than it\nis under there than it is in our new\nhome yes our new home we will make it a\nhome\nI think it's troll camping night buddy\nour route for day two took us to the\nedge of Wyoming's third largest city\nLaramie where we desperately hoped\nthings would start to warm up\nhey Joel techniques for combating\nasphalt\nafter our map led us to yet another\nnon-existent Trail we were stuck riding\nthe shoulder of the paved Road out of\nthe canyon toward Laramie\nwhich went about as well as you would\nexpect the Steep shoulder business is\nreal tricky\nwe are committed look at this Ravine\ndude holy crap yikes okay well at least\nwe got a little shoulder\nyou're putting your foot on the asphalt\nit looks such an asphalt but that's\nlegal\noh my God oh my God oh my God oh slide\nI'm all crossed up this is\nso sketchy\nwell you want to drop down dude\nah\nyikes\noh yep yep\noh that hurt are you okay yeah I just\ncut a rock to the knee yep yep\nthat was exciting\nwow so\nroads up there\nRavines down here looks like the valley\nopens up a little bit so hopefully this\nis the toughest stuff we have to contend\nwith\nwas slow and awkward\nbut the 40 miles from our campsite to\nthe outskirts of Laramie turned out to\nbe the only progress we made that day\n[Applause]\nwell today it did not go particularly\nwell Zach and I spent a lot of time\nriding along paid roads or coming to no\ntrespassing signs or fence lines\nbasically navigation was super\nfrustrating and not very successful and\nuh now we're essentially stuck\nthe plan now is to tuck tail essentially\nand stash these bikes somewhere Dusty or\ndirty or not paved and walk across this\nmajor highway to a hotel\ntomorrow lots of distance covered oh my\nGod we're at crushes\na night in a warm bed boosted our\nspirits and after riding way out of our\nway we were clear of City Limits and\nfeeling optimistic\nwe have navigated our way around the big\nobstacle to get out of Laramie we\nbelieve and now we are on a road called\nHappy Jack we think we have it all\nplotted out but there's still some major\nobstacles including Interstate 80\nincluding another major highway yeah a\ncouple places where we know for a fact\nwe're gonna have to carry the bikes\nagain which we're definitely getting\ntired of uh and then toward the end of\nthe day there's a section of road where\nthe map gets real vague but we looked at\nit on satellite and we think we think\nwe're gonna be able to get through on\npower lines so fingers crossed for that\nbut for now we've got this awesome\ngraded Road wide open the bikes are\nrunning well so Zach and I are going to\ndo a little flat tracking yeah pepper\njack\nthat's pretty good\noh no my poor gearbox\nriding on shoulders and carrying our\nbikes over pavement was idiotic but it\nwas a system and the mission was intact\neven though we knew better than to trust\nit at this point the map said the Open\nCountry of Wyoming and all its dirt road\nGlory was almost in reach\noh my God there's a dead animal down\nthere\noh hold it my breath\nall right\nwe have been having tremendous luck\ntoday uh on account of our excellent\nplanning and also a lot of luck it looks\nas though\nour luck has run out because this is a\nfortified and locked gate\nbasically this means backtracking a lot\nit seemed like our adventure was always\ntaking two steps forward and one step\nback\nafter yet another detour we still had to\nWrangle the bikes across cattle grates\nand Ride Along more Road shoulders\nit was a slow silly way to travel\neven by our standards\nwe're going against traffic which you\nknow it's good because we have line of\nsight but our other option is to carry a\nbike across the road which is something\nwe are definitely tired of doing\nwow look at this Albany population 31\nwell we were just complaining about how\nwe didn't know we were going to do and\nthen we came around a corner and\nliterally there's a place that says bar\nrestaurant lodging and there's a gas\npump I don't know I don't know what we\ndid to deserve this but well our other\noption is to push on\ninto the wintry dusk of Wyoming\nand based on the fact that what we\nthought was a very open route was\nblocked by private roads it's entirely\npossible that may happen again ahead of\nus and frankly I don't think it's smart\nto risk it by pushing on so yeah I don't\nif the sun's gonna go down an hour and a\nhalf and that's at least four hours of\nriding and I'm not sure it can actually\nget colder but it probably will so I'm\ngonna order a cheeseburger and three\nbeers\nand then go to sleep in a bed\nunfortunately beers in bed would have to\nwait\nour ancient bikes were taking a beating\nand needed attention and we needed to\nreassess our route if we had any hope of\nmaking it to Western Wyoming before\nspring\nis leaking oil\nfrom everywhere like the fork is leaking\nthe kickstarter Chef's seal is leaking\nthe tachometer Drive is leaking\noh Fox hello\nwow that's a beautiful animal\nthe dipstick is broken it's supposed to\nextend a little bit more but I'm not\nactually sure how much more so I have a\npiece of cardboard I'm just going to dip\nin there and\nin my headlamp I can see glitter which\nstands to reason because third gear\njumps out a lot so it's just grinding\nmetal\nprobably make it\nI'm just gonna dump a bunch of oil in\nand call it good\nwhen he wasn't getting distracted by his\nFox friend Arie also checked on my bike\nmeanwhile I bravely worked inside where\nthings were going great\ndotted red lines Every Which one of them\nis allegedly a dirt road that we can\nallegedly Traverse\nbut as we found so far that's not always\ntrue and every time we get to an\nintersection and it doesn't work we have\nto come up with an alternate option and\nsometimes there is no alternate option\nyou know because people take paved Roads\nplaces\nthe odds are low\nthat we achieve this I mean so far we've\nspent three days\ngoing\nlet's see one two\nthree pages across Wyoming\nso we need to go\napproximately twice as far as we've gone\nin only a little bit more time than we\nhave\nthe next morning was the coldest of the\ntrip\nwe needed to go faster than ever and the\ngoing was bound to be slow\nokay\nI was just telling you that my my\nfingers are cold right now inside\nthis little Lodge room\nwith my thermal gloves on\nit's not going to be good\nmight be the last time we're warm for\n8 10 12 hours\nI have 222 miles on a chick eater\nmy goal is to add\n130 for that\nafter wind on day one and Gates on day\ntwo it was only fitting that day three\nbegan with snow\nnot exactly ideal conditions for 50 year\nold bikes and with the clock ticking\nI'm coming\nI think I've been\nfudging around as the kids say and I\njust found out\nit looks like you've spilled a Slurpee\non your face like just encrusted yeah my\nface is pretty warm I think it's acting\nas a shield it probably it's blocking\nwind\nyou okay\nokay seriously this time\nare you okay yep\nwell what do you know fell down in the\nsnow again\nshifter broke off on a rock I think I\ncould make deal not really shifting that\nmuch anyway but basically every time we\ndrop the bike Zach broke a brake lever I\nbroke a throttle perch I have now broken\na shift lever like they're pretty\ninnocuous crashes in terms of injuring\nourselves but we keep chipping away at\nthe functionality of the motorcycles in\na way that makes the remaining 250 miles\nof riding kind of a problem\nwell the good news is now that my\nshifter's broken I can't break it\nanymore\ndon't say that don't tempt the Gods\nbeautiful\ndamn\nafter slogging and sliding our way over\ntwo mountain passes our bikes were still\nmostly intact\nand having survived the snow and ice we\nwere ready for a well-deserved break\nRoad\ngoes through like it shows on the map\nand if we don't get bogged down at Mud\nwe'll have completed our longest day yet\nand we'll be back on schedule\nalmost back on schedule ah come on this\nis ridiculous\nholy\nthis is really bad\nstop\nyour tires are basically picking up a\ncarpet of mud yep\nit's bad we put these bikes through hell\nman\nis our Chase truck a Jeep Gladiator\nthat's been mobbing behind us but this\nroad is so muddy that they have decided\nthat it's not smart for them to continue\nhowever\nZach and I aren't that intelligent\nafter you sir\ngo go gadget XL\n350. oh that's a huge puddle hold Moses\nicy too this isn't so bad all right all\nright all right all right you roll it\nhuh\nfor a 50 year old motorcycle\nI am very impressed with what it has\ncarried me through\nwhat was considered a dirt bike from\nYamaha or Honda before these bikes came\nout it was basically just a street bike\nwith like a high pipe on it and Dobby\ntires\nas far as the GT1 is concerned it was\nthe first of the really capable\noff-road bikes because previous that if\nyou wanted to go off-road you had to buy\nsomething weird from Europe like a\nHusqvarna or a montessa or a bull Taco\nlike something exotic and expensive and\nit launched basically an off-road\nRevolution because it was successful and\nreliable people could go out and do dumb\nlike this\nhow do we know it's off-road capable you\nask well\nlook at it go I mean we're basically\nmaking a an ad for a Yamaha 50 years ago\nHonda on the other hand\nwe're not big on two strokes and so\nwhile it might not have been as light or\nas competitive and a True Performance\noff-road sense Honda went this route and\nmade it for the time anyway a pretty\nhigh performance single cylinder\nfour-stroke engine\nare we going the right way I don't know\nclassic shortcut\nugh\nhi guys\nlook at our bikes as old as they are\nthey worked wonderfully we did get\nthrough it was a struggle now hopefully\nsmooth rolling right into town to a hot\nmeal and another hotel bed\nit didn't take long after the\nconversation about a hot meal in a hotel\nbed for things to completely unravel\nfirst the DT's mud caked engine\noverheated and soft seized\nand then the xl350 just stopped\ndead in its tracks\nyou can see that the chain is ridden up\non the sprocket on something tooth and\njammed between the sprocket and the case\nwe are six or eight miles from town from\nour destination\nit's getting dark\nand I don't think I have to tell you\nthat it's cold\nso we need to try and figure this out\nsoon otherwise we're going to be jammed\ngood summary yeah good summary okay\nit turns out jammed was putting it\nlightly\nuh-uh\nthe Thunder yeah are you kidding me\nwe used every method we could think of\nto free the chain including the\ncrankcase splitter that we thought for\nsure would get used on the two-stroke\ndt1\nbut the xl's chain\ndidn't budge\nthat Thunder is turned into a snowstorm\nand we're getting wet the tools are\ngetting wet and we can't see what we're\ndoing and we don't know how to fix it\nand we're covered in mud and we're tired\nwe're gonna put the bike on the side of\nthe road and come back in the morning\nand hope it's still here\nare we gonna put your bike next to it\nare you gonna ride I was gonna ride\nwe have to come back anyway yeah you\nhave to come back anyway okay\nI don't want the XL to feel alone you\nknow\nso much for that hugely successful day\nwe were having six miles from town\ndisaster\nFor Better or Worse the bikes were still\nthere the next morning\nbut despite how things appeared these\nwere lucky motorcycles\nnot only were their Riders very good\nlooking they also had a plan\nZach and I put a lot of thought into\nsolving this problem it's pretty\nstraightforward problem the chain is\njammed around the countershaft sprocket\nand given the environment we're just\ngoing to try and turn the rear wheel\nbackwards to free it since it rotated\nforwards the jam\num we should be clear we already tried\nlast night just not as uh sophisticated\nsolution now we have ratchet straps and\nwe may sacrifice some spokes so if\nyou're watching this you're thinking\nthat's the best idea they had\nyes\nfrozen fingers are crossed here metal\nsprocket metal chain metal engine case\nvery much jammed together and that\nroller of the chain is written up on one\nof the teeth so it's pushed out\nconsiderably\nwe may be screwed\nwe couldn't fix it at least not on the\nside of the trail\nputting the bikes in the back of a truck\nfelt like failure\nbut we weren't entirely ready to give up\nwe hauled the bikes to the hotel parking\nlot and tried to get things turned\naround with a hot bath\nour only hope for freeing the chain was\nto remove the stator cover which was a\ntricky operation what with the mud and\ndebris\nthere was also a distinct possibility\nthat the chain had cracked the crankcase\nor at the very least the cover\neither scenario might end the trip\nHere Comes oh what is it what is it\nwhere's the little Splinter look that's\nrock yeah\noh yeah there's like all sorts of rock\njams in there\neverything's still intact\nit's just messy and muddy but you know\nthat's been the name of the game for the\npast couple days\nwow I never thought we were gonna leave\nthis place I thought we're gonna be\ntrapped here forever you thought we were\njust gonna settle down start our life\nhere I don't know it just everything was\nseeming really disable last night now\nlook at us now look at us\nwe may have succeeded in getting back on\nthe road\nbut Mother Nature wasn't finished with\nus\nso much fun\nmiserable\na bike just stalled\nthe wheels are just caked in mud\nfront wheel's not even turning\nlike this front wheel is stuck\nin the fender and we stopped and we\ncleaned it and we go another 15 feet and\nthen it just does it again\nit's completely insane\nbut this might be this might be it\nfelt like everything in the universe\nwanted me and my bike to quit\nluckily Zach didn't\nwith some encouragement from my friend I\nstripped a couple of parts off the DT\nand we kept trying\ndude I feel obligated to try to help you\npersevere all the many times you have\nhelped me persevere\nthe mud was torturous on man and machine\nhe kept overheating and soft seizing\nbut with some snow on the cylinder and a\nfew minutes to rest it always started\nagain\nthe longer we pushed on the more we\nrealized the bikes were tougher than we\nwere\nwell\nI don't know where we are of what we're\ndoing\nguys\nwe're gonna tuck tail\nwe're gonna get a hotel\nwe may leave the bikes here you may put\nit back in the truck\nwe're going to continue on dirt but\nnot tonight\nit's not too late to get like a\nlike a like a degree like go to business\nschool or something right just another\nline of work\nyeah that's a good idea start banging\nNails man\noff the next morning Arie gave the DT a\nonce over\nand made a crucial Discovery bike has\nseized three times now and we may have\nfinally figured out why or at least\nsomething has been contributing to it\nthis is the oil pump and as you can see\nthe cable has jumped the pulley and is\ncompletely inoperable so\nthe fact that it was still running even\nwith this sort of uh handicap is\nabsolutely remarkable\nI'm gonna fix it now\ncold today but it's not muddy it's not\nsnowing\nthe bikes are running well\nAll Things Considered go great\nand what is this a very large body of\nwater\nfor this we're gonna need the cavalry\nwell that there everybody is the Flaming\nGorge\nand it's full of water which is an\nobstacle for us we don't need to explain\nthat probably and at this point I feel\nlike I could probably just if I had a\nlong enough snorkel and DT had a lot of\nsnorkel we could just vote her across\nthis thing because this motorcycle does\nnot want to die but we do have a plan\nfor getting across the water we did\nactually think about this and we're\ngetting some professional help people\nso all the other marinas up and down\nthis Reservoir here put the boats away\nfor the winter who knows why oh yeah\nbecause it's freaking cold so we ended\nup calling the Sweetwater County\nSheriff's Department we said hey can you\ngive us a lift across this body of water\nsheriff and amazingly they said sure\nyeah they're going to use it as a\ntraining opportunity which is great\num there is still the one issue of\ngetting the motorcycles from the shore\nonto a boat yeah we don't talk about\nboats on this show we need like a Docker\nI don't know there's not much around\nhere yeah I might have to build the jump\nthanks for helping us out Gary nice to\nmeet you Derek\nhey Brian nice to meet you Sergeant\nPowell Zach\ndt-1 on a police boat pretty cool\none down one to go and it does weigh 100\npounds more\nthe trip had been nothing but setbacks\nand struggle\nfinally something worked the way we\nhoped it would thanks entirely to The\nSweetwater County Sheriff's Department\nplant home\nthe ride wasn't over but our Spirits\nwere buoyed and the road ahead looked\npromising\nride across Flaming Gorge taking off in\nthe distance Zach and I have\nsuccessfully made it to the western side\nof the water but now we are on our own\nthat's right camera Crews on the boat\nthey gotta drive all the way around like\nsuckers in a car we've got a couple\nhours of daylight and we are gonna motor\nWest and hope they catch up to us but\nfor now try to make miles\ndon't worry\nthe Sun is\nmoving very rapidly towards the horizon\ndropping fast yeah looks good man the\nmore progress to make today\nthe less distance you got to cover\ntomorrow and that's our last day we've\ngone what\n478 miles as of right now yeah wow\nwe literally literally just pulled over\nbecause the day was getting away from us\nand we were hopeful that our camera crew\nwould come to our rescue oh they almost\ndrove by\noh please\nyou have most of the food\nboys Gladiator boys good to see you we\njust pulled over\nthere was no wind or snow and for the\nfirst time on the trip we actually\nenjoyed making a fire and sitting under\nthe stars\nplus the end was near\nthe miles have been made up\none way or another and now we have a\nfinal push across Wyoming finally a\nfinal push to the Western border 90\nsomething miles right 90 something miles\nas we know Wyoming likes to throw a lot\nof curve balls at us but so far so good\nlooks like it might be another calm\nmoderately warm by moderately warm we\nmean 30 degree day and dry roads so uh\nNavigation always a challenge out here\nwhere there's no service and we're using\na paper map but uh yeah the bikes are\nstill running strong we're feeling as\ngood as we can feel after all this\nhopefully uh no more major issues in our\nfinal day of riding with these two bikes\nwe certainly earned it we can't afford\nit in terms of time and we can't afford\nit in terms of emotional turmoil\nafter days of bad luck bad weather and\nbad ideas our last day writing across\nWyoming was damn near blissful\nOpen Country\nbeautiful weather\nand livestock and Wildlife around every\ncorner\nit had been the most difficult trip we\nhad ever endured\nand neither of us could wait until it\nwas finally over\nthis to our right is the final\npaved road that we have to get across\nand we really do not want to carry it\nand we think there might be a culvert\nRiver Creek thing\nnice look at this\noh we could definitely fit yeah\nsend it dude okay\noh it's Sandy it's sloppy oh yeah it is\noh boy oh boy oh no\nbut trenched out\nattention too I think this is frozen mud\nyeah I do too\noh sorry sorry it's all right I'll turn\naway I've already got cow poop on my\nface\nit's not even trying to fire\nwhat\nidiots we are\nyep\nI hope it starts come on XL come on\nwhat's the deal we've only got like 10\nor 15 miles to go I don't know\noh okay okay\nnow I'm having flashbacks dude\nall right I'm going for it yep\nready yep one two three\none two three\nready one two three\none one two three\nall right my turn\nlet's not do this you're gonna do this\nnow buddy\nhold up hold up you lost me\none more push\nlet's go go go go\nsqueezy buddy\nlook at that landscape man\nI would like to say Wyoming has been\ngood to us but I think what Wyoming did\nis Wyoming tested us\nbeyond our limits at times yeah I think\nwe both we both reached uh break point\nbut I'm proud of the fact that we\nkept pushing on is this it right here I\nthink that there might be Utah my friend\nthis is it\npavement\nI don't know I haven't seen this stuff\nin a while I'm a little suspicious of it\nI'm gonna Park\nright\nhere oh my goodness\nwow it's so smooth think what Heroes\nwe're gonna feel like riding on pavement\nafter all that slippery crap we've been\ndealing with\nthe sun is warm I know how that feels\nit wasn't exactly a clean trip across\nwe did ride on mostly dirt\nmost of the way\nbut we also put our bikes in the back of\na truck\nwe scampered along miles of Road\nshoulders\nand we used some unquestionably dumb\nmethods to get across pavement\nas usual the machines were the real\nheroes\nwhether it was the dt-1 repeatedly\ncoming back from the dead\nor the xl350 almost never missing a Beat\nthese bikes are every bit as capable and\nimpressive as they were 50 years ago\nmaybe one day the dirt roads of our\nworld will go extinct\nbut for now they are still out there\nwaiting for you\nyour iron horses\nand the next great adventure\nlet's go home dude\nboy howdy",

          "transcript": "[Music]\nAdventure Discovery a remote location\nand me a seasoned unprofessional by\nParker hungry for some more so when I\nheard that my mate Marc had planned a\nthree day by packing trip across\nPatagonia why as you can imagine I was\nall over it\nhave you have you packed light you ready\nfor this I think I'm ready just get used\nto these bags yeah of endurance rides\nwith this this speed demon recently won\nthrough France and won through England\nso I thought we'd go epic this time and\nactually pack our tents and all that kid\nI have to say though what an incredible\nday [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] pretty cool isn't it right you\nready\nI left Bonnie Scotland in the rain and\nit's it's stunning it's summer Dame here\nI can't wait I'm excited let's do this\n[Applause]\nPatagonia is the southernmost tip of\nSouth America it's a region without\nclearly defined borders spanning both\nthe countries of Chile and Argentina on\nits western side it has the talent of\nthe Andes Mountains and on its eastern\nside a frigid deserts of pampas and\ngrasslands\nthere is no destination that captures\nthe imagination like this one\na land of breathtaking beauty filled\nwith volcanoes towering glaciers and\nremote Plains Patagonia for me is\nabsolute heaven for this trip our mates\nover at BMC have luckily kisses out with\nthe new specific gravel bike complete\nwith new Shimano TRX one buy and you\nmight already notice that we're not\nwearing our usual GC and Kim al jarreau\nhave been kind enough to sources out\nwith some of this we have made our way\nto buco which is just over 400 miles\nsouth of Santiago our plan is to jump in\nthe vehicles here and head to painting\nfoot where we are going to start our\nadventure from\nwe have pre-planned our roots on Camus\nand there's a total of 320 2.8\nkilometers that we are going to tackle\nwe have got five thousand and twenty\nfour minutes of climbing but luckily we\nhave split the ride into three days our\nfirst day is going to take us from\nFrankie Bowie to put those boys to get\nthere we are gonna hug the shore of the\nLago pani puri and we may even get our\nfirst look and it volcano and our first\nday it's a short one it's sixty three\npoint three kilometres which I'm quite\nhappy about\nit feels so surreal that I was just\nsaying it's like being the middle of\nJurassic Park somewhat yeah I can't have\nto pick myself\ni Patagonia\nit's genuinely feels like being plunked\non the other side of the planet is it\nnot just that we've gone from winter\nriding summer riding but you know it's a\ntrue wilderness down here for those that\nhaven't been to Patagonia before well I\nguess you know this is your first\nimpression totally yeah pretty empty\nthe sun's already dipped below the\nmountains sunset it's officially not\ntill about nine o'clock but you can\nstill see it sort of kissing the upper\nsnowy peaks of the volcano ahead of us\nthat's pretty awesome\noh what a welcome to octagon Ian what a\nwell who ended up having a seriously\nlong day's travel flew into Santiago\nthis afternoon got internal flights I\ngone our bikes and madly sort of pedaled\ninland it's no dark as you can see and\nnear little place called Porta Phi and\nin the morning we have to get the the\nferry the boat across the across the\nisland but hey it's fun got us out from\ntents that I've never sailed before in\nthe dark this thing weighs less than 700\ngrams which is insane perfect for bike\npacking that's a good idea\nhow'd you do that I'll do that\n[Laughter]\ntoday we have planted root which takes\nus over the Argentinian Porter weaving\nthrough some supposedly mind-blowing\nscenery of lakes mountains and forests\nwe are hoping to end up 76 km/h before\nwe ride though given that we're on the\nshores of Lake lag world periodical\nwe're going to start with a boat trip\nthe players catch them 9:00 a.m. ferry\nwhich would take us across the lake so\nwe've gotta get a move on because\notherwise it's gonna be a long long swim\nso I'm just looking over there at two\nvolcanoes on the left you've got more\njoin you know that because it's got a\nflat top and then to your right you got\njust wink oh they look incredible and\nthey're just in that snow Cup but the\ninteresting thing about that snow cap is\nin the last 23 years that's just under\nmy lifetime that snow caps been reduced\nby 40%\nweirdly when we got off the ferry we're\ngonna have only about 10 kilometers to\nthe argentinian border and from there\ndrop down and actually meet up with\nPablo one of the guys who I was climbing\nwith the last time I was here and hope\nLee's going to show you some amazing\ntrails on the gravel bikes when we get\nto Argentina\nthere we go Tim gave Tim key to\nArgentina 10k to the border\nwhat [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that was that right we are\nheaded straight on\nfirst pay gravel and I love it\njust touchdown in Boyd deployed off the\nferry and now we got seven three\nkilometers back off but we're healing\nthe argentinian border in about twelve\nten past already in my little Shimano\nback in I luckily she might have sort me\nout with\nif people watching have never cycled\nacross a border crossing there's\nsomething about it isn't there I mean I\nknow it's just another meter another\nmile but pretty cool riding a bike\nacross the border we're so used to\nflying into a new country but yeah I'll\njust kiss out some never don't fall\nyou've never touched the first time I've\ncycled through order in Europe I guess\nyou have ah how do I even know the gears\nI got 40 tooth on the front I got 42 on\nthe bike I can't let you into the secret\nI have I should use the poise already\nsee little sharp there's some good\nterrain kids on there who terrain\nhalfway through our second day we\nstumble across the most incredible\nlittle beach and a great opportunity to\ntell you a bit about what kit we are\nusing although there is a more detailed\nvideo over on the tech channel if you\nfancy some details let's start off with\nthe bike\nthis is BMC's new gravel bike the BMC\nurs urs is short for unrestricted which\npretty much sums up where mark and I've\nbeen riding but you Paul you don't want\nto see it with fully kitted up you want\nto see the bike don't you so I guess I\nshould get all these bags off BMC say\nthis bike comes in 8.3 kilograms which\nis pretty light and added to that this\nbike has got some really cool features\nthat lead war towards the adventure\ngravel rider this is known as the MTC\nthe micro travel technology that BMC\nhave integrated into this urs frame BMC\nfirst introduced this technology on the\nteam elite XE mountain bike and it adds\nan additional layer of comfort to the\nbike it gives you just ten millimeters\nof suspension travel but significant\nenough to take the edge off bumps and is\nalso designed to help with traction on\nrough and loose trails now Shimano has\nalso helped us out on this trip of a\nlifetime here in Patagonia and they've\nalso got us their new gr X group set so\nI'm using the R X 800 di 2 version now a\nlot of you backpackers out there will be\nshaking your heads at thought of me\ntaking electronic gears out on an\nadventure but to be honest with the tech\nproven over the last 10 years I am NOT\nconcerned and Mark Beaumont has told me\nthat he wrote the length of Africa using\ndi 2\nwell take you a minute to check out our\nbike packin care we also had a quick pit\nstop for lunch before meeting Pablo now\nPablo is Marc's old friend from previous\nvisits back 10 years ago\nI'm Hank good to meet you nice knee my\nmark hey buddy how are you coming here\nin a while are you well\nvery well for the bombs\nPablo has planned his short detour which\nbrings in some of the best local single\ntrack riding in the area before ending\nthe night at his place with an asado\na traditional Argentine barbecue\nyou okay mate well how was your run a\npunch it I know you probably the last\nsingle track and I realize you got all\nthe energy so what an absolutely right\nthat was amazing it was amazing with you\nan amazing day\nwell certainly be yeah I've got to come\nlast nobody need to get one a good you\nsure that's that's karma forget I'm\ngetting smoking my for leaving you out\nthere I know\noh well those buddy what arrived it was\njust a test that is yeah that was\nincredibly hard more than I thought mmm\nbut I'm so impressed with what those\nweights can do and the fact the fact\nthat you you know you punctured on the\non the last little bit in the last bit\nat least I've got time to fix it now yep\nwhat I was staying in there back to my\ntrusty little head not like quickly\nfor our last date we're starting it with\na wicked boat trip across the lake\nbefore starting our biggest day yet it's\none we are both pretty nervous about\nit's 183 kilometers across gravel tarmac\nand single track this will be a true\ntest of both our handling and our\nfitness\nif you'd asked me a few days ago when I\nwas in Scotland I'd be looking for shade\nit's actually quite nice to get go that\nhot on a midday Sun um I'll admit to a\nbit of bike packing cheating going on\nhere because we nabbed a bit of the\namazing spread that the argentinian\nfamily put on for his last night and so\nstuff you wouldn't normally have on a\nbike packing trip James here's got some\nof the leftover lamb beautiful I've got\nsome cheese again that wouldn't travel\ntoo well if you were going particularly\nfar but this is the business we've had\nan awesome morning we run to more like\nopen gravel tracks and somewhere down\nthe road we're going to find tarmac but\nSpa lunch\nwith a remaining hundred clubs to write\nand the border crossing into Argentina\nclosing eight pm me and Mark had to\nreally crack on to make sure we hit it\nwell because otherwise we'll be spending\nthe night on the side of the road so the\npressure is definitely on\nten kilometers to the border hey Steve\nI didn't realize quite how close to the\nvolcano we were gonna get it is there\nwell I guess we made it to the border\njust in time\nthree days of unforgettable bike packing\nand you'd be good I didn't know it'd be\nthat good yeah it's been for me it's\nbeen an absolute ride of a lifetime and\nthere's so many points that I've just\nabsolutely loved massive thank you to\nPablo and your buddies for showing us\nsome insane single track\nyeah gonzo to be fair the crew who've\nbeen filming this have done a superb job\nit's been out it's been a proper\nadventure in the true sense of the word\nyeah I've interesting know what your\nbiggest bike packing adventure is\nremember to leave a comment below and\nhopefully give this a massive thumbs up\nyeah and a massive thank you to be\nemceeing Shimano for making this video\npossible if you guys are hungry for some\nmore adventure by packing videos then\nmake sure you click on our bikes mate we\nneed to eat these hopefully there's a\nscent from here and we'll get locked up\nwe don't get our fruit so let's quick\nstart going down as well cheers Cheers\ndude or on another adventure in the back\nboom mmm",
