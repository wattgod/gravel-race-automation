The missing airport and accommodation strategy information keeps this from being higher."

Bridge washouts forced last-minute course changes, shortening routes by \"a few miles,\" but the staggered starts (8am/9:30am/11am) \"significantly reduced the number of riders at the start of the race.\""

      "technicality": {
        "score": 2,

      },
      "elevation": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "5000 feet over 62 miles delivers consistent work without massive climbing blocks. The rolling profile with ridgeline connections means you're always going up or down, but nothing suggests monster climbs that separate the field. Alabama's steep, direct descents into creek crossings provide the most elevation drama."

        "explanation": "The 2024 race started at 38°F and warmed to 60°F with \"20-30 mph gusts with mostly headwind,\" making the Alabama section particularly challenging. Carolyn Misick appreciated the \"sunny and temps in the 60s\" forecast, though the temperature range \"made it a bit tough to dress for.\" Late February timing avoids summer heat while staying generally rideable."
      },
      "altitude": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "GA/AL border region means you're barely above sea level throughout the course. Starting elevation and max elevation are unreported, but this isn't mountain territory—it's rolling piedmont that won't challenge anyone's oxygen intake. Altitude is completely irrelevant to this race experience."
      },
      "adventure": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Creek crossings provide the main adventure elements, with Carolyn Misick noting \"sinking your shoe into deep muddy water\" before a \"stream crossing at the bottom\" that served as a \"shoe wash.\" The route crosses state lines mid-race, and Carolyn enjoyed seeing \"my time greatly improve as we rode through Alabama which is on central standard time.\""
      },
      "prestige": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Three years old and still finding its identity—started as Border Wars, morphed into Homegrown Gravel Adventure, but everyone still calls it Border Wars. No pro field, no prize purse, no mention of notable winners in any coverage. It's a solid regional event that locals respect for the terrain punishment, but it's not moving any needles beyond the GA/AL border."
      },
      "race_quality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "The organizer claims it's 'quite possibly the best route I have ever created,' but the execution shows growing pains. Mud logjams forced walking sections in 2024, and riders report confusion about state crossings due to twists that obscure the border theme. Aid station details are vague, cutoff times unknown, and the course suffers from identity issues between being a border battle and scenic tour."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "The GA/AL gravel contrast delivers—Georgia's smooth ridgeline meandering versus Alabama's steep, direct punishment creates a genuine split personality ride. Riders enjoy the remote scenic views and appreciate how the 30 miles of paved connectors blend the sectors intelligently. The mud chaos and terrain variety make for memorable war stories, even if the 'border war' theme gets lost in the twists."
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Donates around $2000 to MTB Atlanta and Heard County Food Pantry, showing genuine local investment. The home-grown vibe emphasizes stewardship—respect roads, locals, and land—which resonates with riders who want substance over flash. Early packet pickup at S&S Fire Pits creates a regional gathering feel, though the field size remains mysteriously unreported."
      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "No data on field size, no mention of competitive depth, and YouTube coverage shows riders walking through mud sections rather than racing through them. The advice to 'stick to the front at the beginning' suggests a small enough field where positioning matters early, but there's no evidence of serious competition beyond regional weekend warriors."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Registration cost $91.78 total ($85 plus BikeReg fees) with spots available until a week before the event. The route delivers 65% gravel across two states with three aid stations, including \"Oreos at the last stop which always makes me happy.\" For 2025, field limits increase from 600 to 800 with new age group categories and post-ride shower additions."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Franklin, Georgia isn't exactly a destination hub—no airport details, no lodging strategy provided, which means you're driving and figuring out accommodations yourself. The GA/AL border location means most riders face significant travel unless they're regional, and the late February timing could complicate weather-dependent travel plans."
