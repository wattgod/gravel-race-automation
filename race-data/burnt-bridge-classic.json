Search and rescue teams are positioned on course, which is professional, but basic details like packet pickup and parking remain unspecified in race materials."
      },
      "length": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Chad Grice's elite performance data shows the course's punishing nature: 5:08:10 finish time at 185W average power, with complete bonking on the second lap where he \"cracked so hard\" at 190W and 10 kph. The distance separates fitness levels decisively—even seasoned racers struggle to maintain power through the full route."
      },
      "technicality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "The Kapoor main descent features a corner technical enough that multiple riders \"slid one by one\" into the trees in 2025, requiring search and rescue mobilization. Chad Grice specifically ran 2.1-inch tires and a 75mm dropper post for the technical sections, indicating meaningful skill requirements beyond fire road grinding."
      },
      "elevation": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "3200 feet over 62 miles averages about 52 feet per mile—respectable but not mountain brutal. The 'decisive climbs' description suggests the elevation is concentrated into meaningful ascents rather than constant grinding. It's enough climbing to matter in the final results without being the defining characteristic of the race."
      },
      "climate": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "June 14th date hits Vancouver Island's prime weather window—typically dry with moderate temperatures perfect for gravel racing. The coastal Pacific climate means less extreme heat than interior locations but potential for marine weather changes. Cowichan Valley's sheltered position provides more stable conditions than exposed coastal areas."
      },
      "altitude": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Vancouver Island terrain keeps riders at sea level with no altitude considerations affecting performance or equipment needs."
      },
      "adventure": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Black bear encounters on descents and search and rescue mobilizations for crashed riders create wilderness elements within an organized event structure. Brenna Pauly noted \"lots of variety of terrain and beautiful scenery\" during her solo victory ride, but the race stays within established trail systems rather than true backcountry exploration."
      },
      "prestige": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Getting tapped to host the 2026 Canadian Gravel Championships bumps this from complete obscurity to mild relevance. Race director Jon Watkin is 'super pumped' about the big year ahead, but one championship hosting gig doesn't erase being a regional Vancouver Island event most gravel racers have never heard of. It's 'one of the longest-running' island races, which sounds impressive until you realize that's a pretty small pond."
      },
      "race_quality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "The course delivers variety—technical descents, sustained climbs, and a \"final 10 km flat time trial to the finish\"—with professional safety support including positioned search and rescue teams. However, mechanical failures and course management issues like the neutral start motorcycle crash indicate execution gaps remain."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "The scenic Cowichan Valley provides solid backdrop for 62 miles of racing, and being part of the BC Gravel Series suggests decent organization standards. The technical elements and climbs offer challenge without being punitive. The 2026 championship designation means they're stepping up their game, but it's still fundamentally a regional event with regional energy."
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Panache Cycling Sports and Mosaic Forest Management backing shows local cycling infrastructure support. Being part of the 'rider-favourite' BC Gravel Series creates series loyalty and repeat attendance. The championship hosting suggests the local scene rallies around the event, but it's Vancouver Island community—passionate but geographically limited."
      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Regional Vancouver Island draw limits the talent pool significantly. Even with 2026 Canadian Championships bringing national attention, it's still an island race requiring ferry travel for most serious competitors. The research shows final results exist but zero indication of competitive depth or notable past winners."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Search and rescue positioning, varied technical terrain, and professional organization through Panache Cycling Sports provide substantial racing infrastructure. The course delivers technical challenges, scenic variety, and professional safety support at BC Gravel Series pricing, which typically offers solid value compared to premium gravel events."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Vancouver Island location means ferry costs and limited lodging options drive up total trip expense. Victoria International Airport access helps for fly-in participants, but you're still looking at island logistics and pricing. The BC setting keeps baseline costs reasonable compared to premium destinations, but geography adds unavoidable transportation overhead."
