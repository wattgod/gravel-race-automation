The distance becomes a strategic factor - elite rider Peter Stetina noted spending \"80 miles solo\" after a mechanical, arriving at the \"most roadie-friendly\" finale having \"spent all my bullets.\" Similar distance to Crusher in the Tushar."

        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "This course \"borders on mountain biking\" with sinuous singletrack through McDowell Mountain Regional Park and technical jeep roads that'll punish your drop bars. Loose sand washes demand momentum, rocky descents drop 1,500 feet of punishment, and those 20% paved finishing climbs after 85 miles of desert abuse separate the technical riders from the pretenders. One rider called it \"unexpectedly bumpy\" - cyclist speak for \"this hurt more than I expected.\" More technical than most — comparable to Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

Late February timing provides favorable desert conditions, with one rider noting \"warmth and sunshine\" after \"several months of snow and slop\" from their home region. The race starts at 5 am in cool morning temperatures, but heat becomes a factor for slower riders as temperatures climb throughout the day in the exposed Sonoran Desert terrain. Similar climate challenges to SBT GRVL."

        "explanation": "The course maxes at 4,084 feet with most riding at lower Sonoran Desert elevations. Altitude is minimal compared to other challenges - riders face \"nearly grazing cholla cactus\" and technical descents rather than thin air concerns. The elevation is high enough to be noteworthy but low enough that breathing isn't the limiting factor. Modest altitude compared to Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

          "description": "Raw Highlights form the first race of the 2025 season at Belgian Waffle Ride Arizona. Unfortunately, this year's edition was a bit rough for me as I couldn't find the legs to get over the first climb. I kept fighting into McDowell, but my stomach also went south and I had to settle for survival mode. Still had a killer time of the trails and captures some awesome footage! \n\n🚴‍♂️ Follow Joe:\n• Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/jgoettl2.0/?hl=en\n• Website: https://www.goettlmedia.com/\n\n📈 Ride Data:\nhttps://www.strava.com/activities/13762773019\n\n!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
