The course mixing 60% gravel, 30% pavement, and 10% dirt delivers the Belgian-style racing the series is known for. That 15-25% DNF rate tells you everything: the race design respects neither your feelings nor your fitness. Day-before packet pickup and post-race party show they know how to run an event."

Asheville's tourist infrastructure means actual food and beer culture post-race, not just gas station hot dogs. The humid North Carolina late May/June weather adds another layer of suffering to remember. This isn't just a bike race, it's a proper mountain beatdown."

The remote Kanuga Resort venue on \"1,400 stunning acres\" with \"full-service meeting and lodging facilities for up to 440 guests\" positions the event in premium accommodation territory with corresponding expense levels.
