        "score": 5,
        "explanation": "The most technical major gravel race in the US. Hellhole Canyon has rock gardens and 15%+ grades on loose surfaces. Lake Hodges singletrack, sand pits, and stream crossings. Many riders use hardtail MTBs or add dropper posts. MTB skills aren't optional—they're survival."

        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "SoCal spring is generally pleasant—May Gray marine layer keeps mornings cool. But heat waves happen. 2017 saw 95°F and mass DNFs. Inland canyons trap heat. If you hit a hot year, it's an entirely different race."

      "adventure": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Hellhole Canyon is genuinely remote and gnarly. The mix of terrain—from pacelining on smooth roads to hike-a-biking through sand—creates an adventure unlike any pure gravel race. The Belgian theme (waffles, beer, irreverence) adds character."

      "prestige": {
        "score": 5,
        "explanation": "BWR California is the flagship of the Belgian Waffle Ride series and widely considered the most technical gravel race in America. Winning here proves you're not just fit—you're skilled. It's a bucket-list event for serious gravel racers."

      "race_quality": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Professional production: multiple aid stations with mechanics, medical support, course marshals, and SAG vehicles. The expo is substantial. Course marking is thorough (with GPS backup recommended). The new 'Crit-Cross' finish adds spectacle."

      "experience": {
        "score": 5,
        "explanation": "Unlike any other gravel race. You'll be echeloning on pavement one minute, walking your bike through sand the next. The suffering is varied and relentless. The waffles and beer at the end are earned. You'll swear 'never again' then sign up by Monday."

      "community": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "The Belgian theme creates genuine fun—irreverent branding, waffles at aid stations, Lost Abbey beer at the finish. The vibe is 'we suffer together.' Riders help each other with tubes and encouragement. Post-race party is a proper celebration."

        "explanation": "$250-300 entry is steep for a one-day event. But you get a well-supported course, quality swag, post-race party with free beer and waffles. Whether it's 'worth it' depends on how much you value the experience vs. just racing."

      "expenses": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "SoCal is expensive. Hotels in San Marcos/Carlsbad run $150-250/night. Flying to SAN plus rental car adds up. Food and entertainment in the area aren't cheap. Budget $500-800 beyond entry for a weekend trip."

      "summary": "BWR California isn't a gravel race—it's a multi-surface adventure that happens to award times. It demands road fitness, MTB skills, and the mental fortitude to handle constant terrain changes. The course will break equipment and egos. But surviving Hellhole and cresting Double Peak after 120 miles is something you'll remember forever. If you only do technical gravel right, this is the one.",

      "reality": "BWR California breaks bikes and bodies. Hellhole Canyon has caused collarbone fractures, dislocated fingers, and catastrophic wheel failures. You can flatted three times in a race. 30-40% of starters don't finish in bad years. Your road fitness means nothing if you can't descend rocky singletrack at mile 50 when you're already cooked.",
      "consequences": [
        "Sidewall cuts from rocks can end your day instantly",
        "Crashes in singletrack happen to skilled riders—fatigue kills handling",
        "Cutoff times are enforced—too slow in technical sections and you're pulled"
      ],
      "expectation_reset": "This isn't a gravel race where you can just 'grind it out.' You need MTB skills or you need to accept walking sections. Pre-ride the hard parts or study video. Bring 2 tubes, plugs, and a pump. Consider a hardtail if your ego can handle it."

    "course_description": {
      "character": "Controlled chaos. You'll be in a paceline on smooth pavement, then suddenly hike-a-biking through deep sand, then white-knuckling a rocky descent. The rhythm never settles. It's designed to test every cycling skill you have—and expose the ones you don't.",
      "suffering_zones": [
        {"mile": 8, "label": "Lake Hodges Singletrack", "desc": "Early bottleneck. Sandy, narrow, congested. Crashes happen when fresh roadies overcook turns."},

        {"mile": 80, "label": "Questhaven Road", "desc": "Steep paved climb (18% sections) when you're already wrecked from technical sectors. Cramp city."},
        {"mile": 95, "label": "Sandy Singletracks", "desc": "Deep sand and tech trail when your bike handling is shot from fatigue. Walking is common."},
        {"mile": 120, "label": "Double Peak", "desc": "Final climb. 1,000ft at up to 20% grade. No legs, all heart. People cry here. Then you still have to descend and do the finish circuit."}

      "signature_challenge": "Hellhole Canyon—a rocky descent into a remote canyon followed by an equally brutal climb out. It lives up to its name."
