          "transcript": "welcome back to another video today i'm\ngonna be taking you through the bike\nthat i use to get a top five finish at\nthis year's belgian waffle ride cedar\ncity\ni'll be talking about tires and tire\npressure some weight-winning stuff that\ni did with my setup\nsome key components on my bike that i\nthink are absolutely crucial for grapple\nracing\nand some last minute changes that i had\nto make right before the start\nthis video is sort of a part two to my\nbwr race report video\nwhich you should definitely check out if\nyou haven't already i wanted to get into\ndetail\nabout my bike setup in that video but it\nwas already getting long enough\nso i decided to make a second video just\naddressing bike setup\nlet's go ahead and get into it for this\nevent i went with the niner\nrlt9 rdo which is niners carbon gravel\nrace bike\nand at 510 i run a 56 centimeter frame\nin this model\nthis frame comes with bolt holes on the\ntop tube to attach bolt-on frame bags\nwhich looks super clean\nfor long gravel events the top tube\nframe bag is a must for me\ni keep gels in there and it allows me to\nkeep my jersey pockets from overflowing\nwhich was especially important\nas i opted for a starlight apparel skin\nsuit for this race\nto get a little bit more of an arrow\nadvantage as i knew the speed would be\nhigh\nof course just remember to zip it back\nup after you get your snacks i forgot to\ndo this\nat about mile 90 of the race and lost\nsome of my nutrition on a bumpy section\nof gravel\nfortunately the lead moto that was\nfollowing the lead group\nhad gels for us to use for wheels i ran\nnv's 3.4\nar disc this is not your typical aero\nwheel\nit's super wide with an internal width\nof 25 millimeters and an external width\nof 32 millimeters\nthis width means that the rim plays\nreally well with wide tires not just\nbecause\nthe tire sits wider in the rim but also\nwider tires with wider rims are actually\nmore aerodynamic than wider tires with\nnarrower rims\nthese rims are specifically designed to\nimprove aerodynamics when using a wider\n28 to 32 millimeter tire\nof course iran tires a lot wider than\nthat for this race\nthe race organizers told us that a 40\nmillimeter tire was\nprobably the optimal width for this\ncourse but i actually opted for\na slightly wider tire with the 42\nmillimeter specialized pathfinder pro\ni'm glad i did too because there were\nsections of this course where we were\nabsolutely flying and hitting rocks and\nholes with little to no warning\nand then of course there was the single\ntrack section at the end obviously a 2.2\nmountain bike tire was probably the\noptimal tire for this section\nbut would have been a drag on the rest\nof the course having a slightly wider\ngravel tire was welcome on this section\nthough\nespecially after 115 miles of racing i\ntalked about\nhow impressed i was with the pathfinder\npro tire in an earlier video and that\nhas not changed\nthe smooth center tread is almost as\nfast as a regular road tire when you're\non the pavement\ni'm not gonna believe that until you\npost up some bike path kom's\nusing those tires everyone knows that\nkom's are the ultimate form of evidence\nthe side knobs offer good cornering grip\nand the tire is actually pretty puncture\nresistant\nin fact i actually haven't gotten a flat\non them all year\nnow this may have something to do with\nthe secret weapon that i'm running\ninside the tire which is a tuba light\ntire insert\ni've said this before i think that this\nis a game-changing product for gravel\nflat tires are pretty common in gravel\nracing and it's not too surprising\nbecause you're hitting small rocks and\nholes at high speed\nthis tire insert greatly reduces your\nrisk of getting\na flat and allows you to run lower\npressure for example for this race i ran\njust\n27 psi in the front and 29 psi in the\nrear\nthis may seem extremely low especially\nif you're coming from road\nbut it's actually faster to run a tire\nof this width\nat that pressure if you're riding on\nchunky gravel\nto get a better idea of what tire\npressure you should be running i highly\nrecommend checking out the silka tire\npressure calculator\ni'll leave the link down in the\ndescription on top of all of this the\ntuba light inserts weigh just\n23 grams in the gravel version well\nworth the small weight penalty for the\nadded protection\ndid you just say worth the weight\npenalty dude not only do these things\nadd weight to my bike but they also take\naway one of my go-to excuses when i get\ndropped\nyeah no thanks for my drivetrain i ran a\nshimano grx 800 group set with an 11 to\n34 cassette for chain rings i had a 50\ntooth big ring and a 34 tooth small ring\nbolted onto a sram red cork d0 power\nmeter\ni know a lot of riders are going with\none chain ring on the gravel bike but i\nactually prefer to stick with two chain\nrings\nand it's not just because of the wider\ngear range but also because\nyou don't have to cross chain as much if\nyou have one chainring then your chain\nhas to bend a lot laterally when you're\nin your easiest or hardest gear in the\nback\nwhich costs you power however with two\nrings you can keep your chain\nbetter in line to get a better idea of\nhow much a one by drivetrain might cost\nyou\nfellow news reported on a test done by\nleonard zinn at ceramic speeds\nlaboratory\nthe results showed that the average\nfrictional loss with a one by drivetrain\nwas 12.24 watts the average frictional\nloss with a 2 by drivetrain\n9.45 watts speaking of power loss from\nthe chain it's probably a good time for\nme to go over what tools i was carrying\nduring the race\nto start i carried a small bottle of\nsquirt chain lube which i would apply\nmid-race not only are these small\nbottles easy to carry in a jersey pocket\nmid-race\nbut squirt also makes one of the lowest\nfriction chain lubes\nre-lubing mid-race is important for most\nlong-distance off-road races and was\nabsolutely critical at cedar city\nbecause the course was so dusty and the\ndrivetrain would collect that dust and\nstart making noise\nand if you can hear your drivetrain\nyou're losing a significant amount of\npower\nhow much power well under the worst\nconditions you could probably be looking\nat efficiency losses\nof over 20 watts i got a bunch of\ncomments in the last video about how\nexactly i lubed my chain while riding so\ni'll do my best to explain i would wait\nuntil\na slight downhill road section and then\nunclip with my right foot\nand keep pedaling with my left foot\nwhile i bent down\nto lube my chain if you try to lube with\nyour right foot clipped in\nyour foot is gonna get in the way\nbelieve me i've tried\ni did this twice over the course of the\n125 mile event\ni also carried a small lightweight\nmulti-tool a 25 gram co2\nand a stands dart plug in case of a\npuncture notice how i didn't say tube\nthat's because for this race i actually\ndidn't carry one\nfinally something i can agree with you\non if i get a flat i just ask my riding\nbuddies for a tube\nsaddlebags are so not pro so what's with\nthe decision not to carry a tube\nwell given the strength of the field if\ni were to get a flat that i couldn't fix\nwith a plug and had to put a tube in\nthen i'd already be out of contention\nfor a high placing\nnot to mention that if you do have to\nput a tube in during a gravel race then\nyour chances of getting another flat\nskyrocket\ni talked to multiple people after the\nrace who got one flat\nand then continued to get many more\nflats throughout the day as they pinch\ntheir tubes\nso if your tire plug doesn't work and\nyou have to put a tube in make sure to\nput\na lot of pressure in there or else you\ncould be looking at a long day on the\nbike\nand don't get me wrong i wouldn't pull\nout of the race if i got a flat i'd do\nmy best to get to the finish\npulling out is always the last resort\nwhile we're talking about\ndumb weight weaning advice that you\nshould definitely not take from me\nlet's talk about pedal and shoe combo a\nlot of riders run\nmountain bike pedals and mountain bike\nshoes for gravel racing\nbut you do see some riders run road\npedals and road shoes\ni actually run mountain bike pedals with\nroad shoes\nwhy well for starters it's the same\ncombo that i run for mountain bike\nracing so it's easy to swap over\nbut also road shoes can be significantly\nlighter than their mountain bike shoe\ncounterparts\nthere can often be a 200 to 400 gram\ndifference\ndepending on the model and brand that\nmakes sense but why use mountain bike\npedals\ni personally run the crank brothers\neggbeater 11 pedals and at 180 grams\nthey're actually lighter than most road\npedals and\nif you get into some mud or have to get\noff your bike the cleats don't get\ngunked up\nmaking it hard to clip in fortunately\ntoo crank brothers makes a three-hole\nmountain bike cleat so i don't have to\ndo\nany drilling into my expensive carbon\nspeaking of which the shoes that i ran\nfor this race are the giro empire\nslx which are super light and come in at\n185 grams per shoe\njust to close out this weight weenie\nsegment in my shenandoah 100 video i\ntalked about how i need to start using a\ngopro during these races\nwell i actually have a gopro but given\nthe strength of the competition\ni didn't want to put myself at any\ndisadvantage so i was actually just\ntoo much of a wait we need to use it\nfortunately there were a lot of people\nout there getting footage\nand that's what i used for my video so\nbig thank you to all of them\ni left links for their channels and\nwebsites down in the description so\nplease go and check them out\nback to the bike check i ran a carbon\nnbc post with a carbon rail\nspecialized phenom saddle interestingly\nenough i have both the s-works and\nnon-s-works version of this saddle\nand i actually opted for the non-s-works\nversion even though\nit's a little bit heavier because it has\na little bit more give to it which makes\nit\nquite a bit more comfortable over a long\nday of gravel riding\nyou know i was really starting to get\ninto this video when you were talking\nabout how\nlight your shoes were and how a gopro is\ntoo heavy\nbut now you just lost me again a heavier\nsaddle\nalright let's talk about this cockpit we\nshould probably address the elephant in\nthe room first\nyes in this bike check footage shot the\nday before the event by\nenvy i do have aero bars on my bike but\nthe next day during the actual race\nno arrow bars so what gives no i wasn't\ntrying to psych out my competition i did\nfully intend to run arrow bars for this\nrace but the night before the event\nsomebody sent me a message on instagram\nsaying that they thought that aero bars\nweren't allowed at bwr\nthe next morning i got to the race about\n30 minutes before the start and asked a\nrace official\nand it turns out he was right no aero\nbars at bwr\nso there i was taking my aero bars off\nabout 20 minutes before the gun went off\nhonestly man you should probably buy\nthat race official a beer\nhe saved you from completely\nembarrassing yourself to be honest\nthough i don't think they would have\nmade a whole lot of difference at this\nrace and here's why\nfor the first 105 miles of the race i\nwas working in a group\nand the only thing they would have done\nis allow me to pull through a little bit\nfaster when it was my turn at the front\nthe race was really decided on the big\nclimb at mile 105\nand the 4 mile single track section\nright after that\nboth of which i wouldn't have been able\nto use aerobars on\nand in fact having extra weight on my\nbars may have just slowed me down\nmoving on to the rest of the cockpit i\nran an envy aero stem\n100 millimeters in length and negative\n17 degree rise\nin order to run this stem which uses a\nproprietary top cap to make it more\naerodynamic you have to take off any\nsteer tube\nabove the stem so durianrider would be\nproud actually i take that back\nhe'd be pissed because i had disc brakes\non my bike for handlebars i used the\nenvy road bar\nin a 40 millimeter width which is pretty\nnarrow but i do that to get in\na narrower more aerodynamic position\nthis is also the reason why i don't run\na typical gravel handlebar that's flared\nout in the drops\nwhen i'm in the drops i want to be as\naerodynamic as possible\nand having a wide bar that's flared out\nis not the best way to do that\nto keep things comfortable in the drops\ni run road tags which\nact as a thumb rest during the course of\na long race when you're spending a lot\nof time in the drops\nthese help to make that position more\ntolerable\nfinally we have the shimano grx hoods\nand levers one thing i love about these\nis the ridges on the hoods and the\nslightly wider brake levers which give\nyou a bit more confidence that your\nhands and fingers won't slip\nduring technical gravel descending\nthanks for watching if you want to stay\nup to date on my racing and bike setups\nthe best way to do that is to follow me\non instagram\ni also announce when i post new videos\nthere if you enjoyed this video give it\na like\nsubscribe for weekly cycling videos just\nlike this one\nand share this video with your cycling\nfriends i'll see in the next one",

          "description": "Quick correction: Mile 74 title is supposed to be mile 54. \nThe Canyon Belgian Waffle Ride, Cedar City 2020 was a race to remember! Epic, gnarly, increadibly. This was the most unique gravel race I have ever taken part in with everything form hero gravel, loose and sandy double tracks, a super steep and loose climb, and a legit, rocky mountain bike single track. Luckily, I had my Trek Checkpoint SL7 set up with Bontrager Gr1's 700x40c running about 40psi to take on this beast of a course. I made it through the initial carnage making the front group at mile 36. \n\nHowever, come mile 44, I fell off the lead and into no mans land until joining up with Brian McCulloch. We traded pulls from mile 52 to 110. I was just ahead of him coming off the mtb trail until cramps took over my legs and he went around me. I then ended up following the wrong arrows through town and finished just ahead of him. I talked to the results people to get it sorted out and we put me back behind him to officailly finish in 9th overall! \n\nSuper stoked to crack the top 10 at a race like this! Huge thanks to Cedar City and Canyon Belgian Waffle Ride for the opportunity to showcase all the hard work us riders have put into training for events like these!\n\nBike Setup:\nBike: Trek Checkpoint SL7\nWheels: Bontrager Aeolus Pro3v's\nTires: Bontrager 700x40c Gr1's Team Issue set up tubeless @ 40psi\nComputer: Wahoo Element Bolt\nPeddles: Speedplay\nGearing: Sram XX1/Force Etap combo with 40 tooth up front and 10t - 50t cassette",

I walk you through the whole race, breakdown each sector, and give you my cycling commentary as the gravel race plays out.   \n\nThe belgian waffle ride has a mission to be known as the hardest one day bike races in North America, and this gravel race in Cedar City, Utah lives up to that goal. This gravel race had one of the best courses ive ever ridden. It wasn't too difficult so if you had good base fitness and bike handling skills, you felt pretty competitive for a while. \n\nBIKE SETUP : \nBike - Canyon Grail\nWheels - IRC double cross 38s on Princeton carbonworks rims\nGearing - 2x 50/34 - 11/40\nRoad Shoes and pedals \n\nNUTRITION: \n(What I started with)\nx2 cups of coffee\n600 calories in SIS gels\n900 calories in bottles\nx2 30g bottles of ketones (should be illegal)  \n(What I got on the road)\n2 waters\n4 SIS gels\n1 Cliff Block\n\nSTRAVA\nhttps://www.strava.com/activities/4208272197/analysis\n\nCheck out Dylan and his top 5 finish here - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri8mtN5O-0o\n\nDAILY VLOG VIDEOS: \nDay 1 - https://youtu.be/4SYlO9PmVNs\nDay 2 - https://youtu.be/f_8AO3wAGIQ\nDay 3 - https://youtu.be/uWI7UF6inKU\nDay 4 - https://youtu.be/FGH5k1SO5bk\n\n//////www.Whoop.com /\nhttps://bit.ly/2UXZ8zN follow this link and use code \"vegan15\" to get 15% off any membership\n\n//////The best kits in the world\nwww.ElielCycling.com - code veganbro10\n\n/////Hella sick Shirts n stuff\nhttps://www.ridebikesbro.com\n\n/////Recovery Shakes\nhttps://kyoku.com/ (Code \"thevegancyclist\" for 15% off)\n\nfollow me bruh\nhttps://www.facebook.com/theVeganCyclist\nhttps://www.strava.com/athletes/180549\nhttps://www.instagram.com/the_vegan_cyclist/\n\n#gravelracing #cycling #bikeracing #gravelbike\n\n0:00 Quick Recap\n0:48 My setup\n1:59 The Start\n7:26 54min \n9:02 1hr 30min \n11:48 2hr 10min \n13:48 2hr 45min \n15:35 3hr 25min\n17:49 4hr 23min\n20:05 5hr 18min\n22:23 5hr 42\n25:51 Final time & power",

          "transcript": "three two one here we go\nthe canyon waffle ride underway\nokay\noh yeah\nyou all right\n[Music]\nokay so before we jump into the race i\nwant to break down how i'm feeling how\ni'm going into this and my\nuh gear setup now the day of the race my\nwhoop score was 85\nso great i am feeling super good which\nwas good to see that\ntuesday and wednesday i was in the red\npretty much the whole week i was a turd\nnow have you ever seen this video where\nthis guy's bandaged up he has everything\nhe can possibly put on him to help him\nperform\nand then even with all those things that\nare trying to help him out he just fails\ninstantly\nthat's kind of how i'm doing i am\nbandaged up here i've got an arrow\nhelmet\ntry to help me go fast i've got 60\nmilligrams of ketones that's a lot\ni've got my amp lotion on my legs i've\ngot 600 calories 300 milligrams of\ncaffeine\nuh in gels on me i've got 900 calories\n300 grams of carbs in my bottles i've\ngot 50 psi\non 38 with aero wheels from princeton so\nmy setup is fast i've also got super\nstiff\nroad shoes i'm on the canyon grail which\nhas a gear ratio that my best is 34\n40 i'm really happy with this setup i'm\nfeeling good and\nwe're ready to just go as hard as we\npossibly can\nmy training has been really good going\ninto this and so we're gonna break this\ndown into\nthe different sectors so the first like\nsector one\nand two uh of gravel this includes our\nlittle lead in here\num it's 124 miles 200 kilometers\neveryone's got their masks on at the\nstart everyone's really trying to\nvie for the front because there's i mean\nthere's a lot of people here and there's\na big pinch point\nnow right here instantly there's a crash\nand what actually ended up happening is\nthat guy like pushed my back brake\nin i lost my back brake for a little\nwhile it came back eventually\nbut it was really scary uh to almost\nhave my race ended immediately\nso now we go through this tunnel and i\nknew that we pre-ridden this so i knew\nthis was going to be an\nimportant part i thought i was far\nenough up front\neveryone's just getting crammed in here\neveryone can't go and this is exactly\nwhat\ntravis had predicted is that it was\ngonna just be a total [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] show here\nyou can see cole in the white he\nactually dropped his chain so he's\nrunning through the tunnel um\nand so now full gas i mean you have\njust shot out of a cannon where you were\nyou know it's cold it's like 40 degrees\nthat was a big component of it is how\ncold it was at the start so\ni've i was actually really dialed in my\nldl gear i had like a\nthermal jacket and a vest gloves the\nwhole the whole thing\nbut so we are now trying to catch the\nfront group\nyou can't see anything i know that you\ncan see quite well here\nbut the dust was so bad i mean i could\nnot see the front i didn't know how far\nthey were\nand when we pre-rode this one of the\nbiggest mistakes is that when me and\ntravis pre-rode this we did not\nride it at race pace and the gravel is\ncompletely different when you are doing\n25 30 miles an hour versus doing 17.\nso everything felt way more rough and\nloose\nand just really unfamiliar\nand so now again my legs feel like\na ton of bricks because there was really\nno warm-up i mean we coasted into this\nlittle tunnel and then all of a sudden\nyou are full gas and so i'm trying to\nstay on some wheels we're going over\nthis climb guys are getting\nspit out there's gaps everywhere and i'm\nthinking\nthis was it i mean i've made it a whole\none mile\ninto the race before i'm no longer in\ncontention\nuh and i you know i don't even know what\nposition i'm in i don't know how\nfar up the front group is we finally do\ncome together and i'm like huh whoo\nglad that uh i saved this one right so\ni'm\nkind of trying to regroup gather myself\nand then there's a big wreck\nand it's so difficult to make quick\nadjustments because of how the gravel is\nso\ni saw that wreck coming from a while but\ni just couldn't stop or couldn't get\naround it\nso now again full gas chasing we're\ntrying to get back onto the group\nand we really need to get back on it\nbefore we start going downhill so you\ncan see\nthe front group up there it's it's a\nlittle hard to see\nuh but i don't know how far away they\nare i don't know if we're gonna catch i\ndon't know\nanything man um it's we are\nat elevation so it's about almost 6 000\nfeet above sea level\nand so then with the full gas poop pants\neffort\nright off the beginning and it being\ncold my brain is dead i really have no\nidea what's going on i have no far\ni have no idea how far back i am i'm\njust trying to pedal and so then now we\nhit the\nnext dirt section which this is like\nslightly downhill\nand again i know that it maybe looks\nlike you can see\nyou can't see you can't see 20 feet 30\nfeet in front of you\nand so if someone crashes which a lot of\npeople were you could just\nfull send right over the top of them and\nso i was being a little bit cautious\nhere\nuh definitely through these tunnels i\nwas just also\nreally disappointed with how my legs\nfelt in that\nopening of 10 minutes they just felt\nlike absolute bricks\ni don't know kind of intimidated a\nlittle bit thinking oh man i\njust do not have it today uh\ntrying to stay on these guys wheels i\nthe whole time\ni was sort of always just like a bike or\ntwo off of\neveryone's wheel and i just think that\nthat\ncomes from i just wasn't comfortable not\nknowing where i was going or\nwhat like i couldn't see i wanted to see\ni wanted to see what i was riding over\nuh we're flying through it's such a\nbeautiful scenery\nfor one it was gorgeous um the gravel's\npretty chunky here again\nat full gas race pace it is completely\ndifferent than we pre-wrote it\nwe do finally have everyone come\ntogether and so\ni guess i've made the front group but\nit's really big\nand so then i'm expecting you know that\nthis group is going to probably stay\nthis size for a little bit also again\njust not really thinking\nat elevation early the whole thing my\nbrain was just\nturned off and at this point i should\nhave\nfought as hard as i could to get to the\nfront we didn't pre-ride this part of\nthe course\nand uh or when we turned right here and\ni should have because i was\nway out of position you know probably\nlike top 50 here\nnow unfortunately this next section is\nit was the most important section\nand i have no footage of it my gopro\ndied\nand once we hit this section there was\nno way\ni could take my hand off to change the\nbattery so as we turn off this road\nsection and\nto basically where the first climb was\nyou know you can just see how way out of\nposition i am i'm probably top\n50 and i i just didn't know man i just\nhad no idea i guess how skinny this road\nwas or how it was going to play out\nbut this is where the front just lit it\nup\nand i could see nothing and i i don't\nhave really a good gopro shot this was\nprobably one of the most beautiful\nsections of the race and the gopro just\ndidn't get it\nright but is what it is you couldn't see\nanything and there were some downhill\nsections\nwhere you were just full sending into\ndust\nand there could be someone crashed i\nthere could be huge holes you just don't\nknow and so\nwe hit the first kom and i started\nreally feeling good my legs just came to\num i was feeling super confident and\nthen so once i kind of got through a few\nguys i'd realized\nthe front group is gone i can't even see\nthem\nso by the time i got to the front of the\nsecond group\nit's like shoot dude the race is pretty\nmuch over and then there's this huge\ndownhill section that i don't have on\nfootage\nand you know is everyone just doing what\nthey could to try to\nform their group okay so this next\nsection\nfor me personally was one of the hardest\nsections because guys were\nreally trying to bridge up to groups\nthey were trying to get back on terms\nwith the race\nyou know average 274 for this section\nwhich doesn't sound like a whole lot\nbut it really was um i got into a decent\ngroup of some strong guys\nand we were kind of picking up\num people getting blown off from the\ni have no idea where i am on the road at\nthis point\ni'm really starting to feel good it sort\nof feels like we're maybe the second or\nthird\ngroup on the road at this point and then\nit starts getting pretty technical\nthey have these little over under things\nand now\nwe're into these long stretches\nwhere the road is sort of split and line\nchoice was so important\ni swear it was like if you chose the\nwrong side of the road you'd be doing\n50 percent more energy or hit a patch of\nsand and\ngo to a complete stop it was uh it was\ncrazy how\ndifferent one line was and it would\nchange\nand so here i'm feeling super good and\nso now i'm just\npowering i'm getting over this the the\n50 psi and my 38s um are keeping me\nsuper efficient like i'm rolling so\nfast it is way unstable that was the big\nissue though\nis that i would hit little bumps and i\nkept coming unclipped\nlike there was because of the psi being\nso hard i'd hit little bumps and my\nliterally my shoes would just come out\nof the pedals which was something that\ni've\nreally never experienced i'm pushing the\npace this kid had caught us\nand is just drilling it i mean i'm doing\nlike 300 350 watts in his draft\nnow i'm going to kind of try to show you\nhow the groups were forming\nright so there you got the front group\nof like seven\ndylan johnson he's in it he did a\nphenomenal\nuh then you've got a bunch of guys blown\nout of that front group kind of coming\nbackwards\nthen you had a good sized group um that\nwas like a chase group\nokay and then my group which is a\nhandful of us\ntrying to get back on terms right and so\ni guess we're like the fourth group on\nthe road at this moment\nthen you have a bunch of guys that are\njust blown out of everyone and they're\ngoing back\neither having issues then you had a\npretty good sized group of some fast\nguys\ncoming um and then pretty much everyone\nelse\nyou know sort of just at this point\ngoing you know what our day's\nprobably over we're just gonna try to\nenjoy the ride\num you know a lot of people had crashes\nmechanicals\nissues in the beginning so i'm really\ngrateful that i\ni didn't have any mechanicals the next\nsector is\nfeels pretty flat but there's just a lot\nof little technical aspects\nwe hit some sand on this section uh\nwe're about two hours in at this point\nand so again the left or right\nyou know you could just be hauling balls\nand then all of a sudden\nthe lane that you were in was terrible\num\ni like i said i was always just slightly\noff everyone\ni was constantly trying to get back on\nterms uh\nhitting some sand now this\nsand was super deep and there was a lot\nof times where\nit was very easy for you to unclip and\nthen have to walk\ni didn't have to do that i was able to\nkeep my power up and really push through\nbut again some you can see the guy on\nthe left he had such a better line\ni'm just you know in the beach sand but\ni'm trying to save my power\nright so right now i could bridge that\ngap in front of me to this dude\nbut i'm not gonna be able to see where\ni'm going if i'm right on his wheel\nand then i'm gonna have to burn a match\nand i'm trying to keep it pretty steady\nmy power wise especially for this event\nif i just stay\nzone 3 low zone 4 i should be really\ngood\nso then now we get into a little more\nsand\nand a little bit of a climb everything's\ngood my\nchain though is so dry my chain was\nmaking noises i've never heard a chain\nmake before it felt like it was gonna\nsnap at any moment\nso now here's kind of how the groups are\nthere was a\nfew guys just up the road within\nbridgeable distance that i could get to\nuh but there was also a bunch of guys\nbehind me\nand so then i kind of had to make this\ndecision on what which group i was going\nto go with\nand i chose to stop and get some chain\nlube\nand then followed the group behind me\nthinking that the group behind me we\ncould\nget together and chase down the group in\nfront of us which actually ended up\nworking out great\nso then now this next section is sort of\nnot a whole lot going on but there was a\nbig road climb\non this section so on the road you can\nsee that it's me and these these three\nother guys and we're kind of trying to\ncatch this\nuh the little blue four guys up the road\nwe're not really making\nany sort of gain on them and\nthere's a huge group behind us that is\njust motoring\nso me and these three other guys sort of\nmake the collective decision to\nease up and go back to the group that's\ngaining on us anyway\nright and so which was a great decision\nbecause you could be going\nso hard uh but if there's like this\ngroup\nthey are not going that hard and they're\njust covering so much distance\nso it was really good to get in with\nthem especially going into the\nfirst or i think the second kom now that\nthis big climb here is on road so again\nmy 50 psi\nmy 38's my irc's uh\nthey're called the double cross they\nwere rolling\nso fast now guys started to break up\nit was pretty difficult it's pretty long\nclimb and so then you've got these guys\nup front\nthat are pushing the pace and i had to\ntry to bridge this gap you know i again\nit's really hard to know who's strong\nand who's not who's feeling it\num but on this climb it did that big\ngroup there\ni don't want to say it split in half but\na few people didn't make it over this uh\nthis big\nroad climb yeah my time on this kom\nactually gave me third overall in my age\nfor the km competition so we get over\nthe top everyone's sort of shaking their\nlegs out\nuh trying to feel out what this next\nsection is going to be like\nfeeling pretty good at this point you\nknow i've put down some good calories\nsome good carbs\nthose ketones are freaking magic and so\nthen this next section\nhas a little bit of technicality to it\nand then a\nhuge road section so as we get into this\nmore technical spot all i'm trying to\nthink is\ni have to stay with this group to the\nroad and\nyou know again the whole time i'm just\nbike links off of people i don't really\nknow why\nother than i was just nervous maybe i'm\nnot really sure\ngetting over here now some guys it\nseemed like they didn't have the right\ngearing\nthis guy i know he kind of went off the\nside there but a lot of people\nthey were grinding up these little\npitches so my 34\n40 i was able to spin i was able to keep\nthe legs light i was able to\nnot have to put a ton of torque and slip\nbecause that's one of the biggest\nthings with the gravel is that you know\nif you have a lot of torque\nyou know you're just spinning your\nwheels so a lot of your energy and your\npower is going to\nrotating your wheel and not actually\nmoving forward\nso i'm doing the best i can to try to\nstay with this group\nwe're flying the dust was so\nbad you could you could like literally\nyou could see nothing i couldn't see\nwhat was happening i couldn't see what\nwas\ncoming up and so this often would have\nme sort of fall off a little bit just so\nthat i could see\nanything and also my glasses the\nvisibility\nwas was something i did i hadn't really\nexpected but my glasses sort of\nuh had this like coat of dust on it so\nthere was like really bad glare it's\nkind of insane\nbut we get to the road section this\ngroup is\nfull of some seriously strong diesel\ntype motors i mean they are\nrolling and so then i we pre-rode this i\nknew\nwhat to expect here i knew that we were\ncoming into a big road section\nso i could just sort of really not have\nto worry about\nburning any matches like i just stay on\nthis group and then i can recover\nfor a while which is what ended up\nhappening\nuh the group here sort of settled down\nthis was the easiest part of the race\nso what are we like almost four hours in\nbefore we really started\nsort of had a recovery period\nall right so we only have 35 miles left\nto go\nwe're four hours 23 minutes into this i\nthink i'm about top\n40 going into an another pretty\ntechnical gravel section\nand the trek rider and the stan's no two\nthat's the the leader of the the women's\ndivision\nthose two were so strong i mean they\nwere pushing the pace\nuh this trek guy was just like\nhands down the strongest in the group\nbut what was so crazy is\nyou know because i think it's so flat\nand there's a lot of wind\nuh it was really hard to get away from\nanyone i mean you could spend\nso much energy on the front and really\ndo no damage\nand so i'm trying to just stay with\nthese guys i popped another ketone\nyou know so i did 30 milligrams at the\nstart then i did another 30 milligrams\naround this point\nso i'm feeling really good you can see\nhere she's the leader of the the female\ndivision the women division and right\nthere she's like slipping and spinning\nand i saw a lot of people doing that um\nmaybe just not the right gearing or just\nbeing\nover twerked on some of these uh\nslippery climbs and\nnot that she doesn't know how to write\ngravel i'm just saying in general\nthere is a skill set to knowing how to\napply power\nto gravel roads and how to climb\nwhere you're not just using raw power or\ntorque and being really efficient\nso i got through there i got through\nthat section\nthere were some pretty difficult times\nbut\ni made it i'm so excited i'm so stoked\non where i am and how i'm feeling\nwe are headed into the hardest part of\nthe ride which is this big\nsandy climb everyone here is kind of\npace lining a little bit\neveryone's you know maybe 70\nin i mean we're wanting to catch as many\npeople as we can\nbut no one's really trying to completely\nempty the tank\nthere's a big road section and a bit of\na climb we had a tailwind section here\nand if everyone really wanted to empty\nthe tank i think we could have made up a\nlot of time here\nbut pretty much everyone wanted to just\nstay on wheels i know i did i wanted to\nsave as much as i could coming up to the\nmain\nclimb lucas he had crashed um\nand so he was out of the front group\nwhich is a bummer we're all kind of just\ngetting ready for the next and hardest\npart of the race\nall right so going into the big climb\nthe hardest section on this course\nuh we're about five hours in only 18\nmiles left i had to stop and get some\nuh some food and some fuel this was the\nfirst rest stop that i\nstopped at and velofix here he got me\ndownloaded with a bottle\nnow they made a change last minute that\nyou could have personal support\nwhich really made it for a lot of\nhitters or people who\nhad a lot of support out here to have\nquite an advantage\nbecause you didn't have to stop at the\nrest stops you had people all over the\nplace\nand and due to kova they just thought\nlike that's a better way to do it is to\nhave your own personal support than\neveryone\nhanging out at a rest stop um so for the\nmost part i\nbrought enough fuel with me to get me to\nthis point and so i hadn't had to use\nany public rest stops\num until that one and i grabbed like i\neight sis gels and i had that one bottle\nfrom velofix that he gave me\nand so the sis gels are really thin like\nthe viscosity is\nvery watery and so even though i didn't\nhave a ton of water at this point\num i could use those gels almost to\nhydrate myself as well\nbut this climb is so sandy it's so steep\nit was\nreally hot it was really strange to go\nfrom like 35 in the morning to right\nhere it felt like a thousand degrees\nand there's there's just no way you're\ngonna find\nsome big effort inside of you it's just\nmore about\nnot completely blowing up because\nthere's a couple sections on this where\nit's so\nsandy and so steep that you're having to\ndo four 500 watts just to stay upright\nand so you know if you are in the red\nand you get to a point where you can no\nlonger sustain that\nand if you unclipped and had to walk it\nwould be real\nyou could lose a minute you could lose\ntwo minutes you could lose so much time\nand just i guess mentally be so cracked\nso i just sort of held you know high\nzone three\nlow zone four feeling really good at\nthis climb\nuh knowing that what's coming next is a\nbig downhill and that single track\nand so this is it this is the final run\nin\nuh we're 14 miles left to go we've got\na good size downhill and then that crazy\nsingle track\nand so until this point i feel like my\ntire choice had been spot on like it was\nreally good it was super fast\nit was a little hard to control in some\npoints but ultimately i think it was the\nfastest setup\ncoming down into this section and\nespecially the single track\ni should have stopped and at the top and\nmaybe let some pressure out\ni think if i let some pressure out i\ncould have actually went\nfive minutes faster in this last section\njust because\nyou know of how it was really hard to\ncontrol this\nsandy section we i did that twice in our\npre-ride so i kind of knew a little bit\nabout this section\nalso at this point i was more afraid of\na mechanical\nso close to the finish than really\nimproving my position\nuh you know i mean i'm not gonna catch\nanyone in front\nit's just more about not losing any\npositions\nin the group that we're in and so we\nkind of had this group of\na few people you know not full gas\nracing but just kind of staying together\nlet's get to the single track together\nlet's go down these\nthese hills let's keep it safe and so\nyou know we're headed towards\nthat single track and uh\ni think we have maybe a group of like\nsix here and i can't see really anyone\nup the road so i have no idea\nyou know if we're even gonna catch\nanyone or not and again like i said\nright here\ni should have aired down if i had\ndropped 20 psi\nright here even though i feel like oh\ni'm gonna stop and i'm gonna lose all\nthis time\ni would have gained it would have been\nit would have been huge\nit would have been so much better\nbecause at least in the beginning\nit wasn't so bad but the end of this\nsingle track is\nso rocky and bumpy that\ni mean it was almost like i was on a\npogo stick i kept coming unclipped um\nit was almost impossible to control the\nbike i was getting really frustrated\nit was like i hit every single possible\nrock\nwhich was kind of a bummer and so then\nthe two guys in the blue and\nyellow and the stan's no tubes\nuh woman they kind of they were gone\num i was stuck behind this guy for a\nlittle bit he let me buy\nand i thought i was gonna catch those\nother people but again like i said the\n50 psi was\nnot good for this single track great for\neverything else not good here\nnow unfortunately my gopro dies uh i\ni had three batteries on me and somehow\nthey just\nall popped out it was really bump anyway\nlost my batteries\nand so i couldn't change my battery for\nthe fin the finish\ni don't have the finish on film\nwhich is super irritating um but so we\ncome out of the single track\nand there's about i have a group of like\nfour or five\nand it was really fast through like\nthese little\num walk paths and and bike paths and so\nhere's kind of the reenactment of the\nfinish is that we come\nin to the final sprint we've got lucas\non the front we've got\ni'm on the back of this group here and\nuh\nthis guy in the y he takes off he's\nsprinting i wish i had this on footage\nbecause i'm staying on his wheel\nand the last minute i actually out\nsprinted someone\ni won the pack sprint out of the group\nthat we were with then i did a wheelie\nand then i did a backflip and then i\nturned into a banana i have no footage\nof it but trust me it's what happened\nso my finish time was six hours 34\nminutes that's 39 minutes off of first\nuh the winner's time was five hours 55\nminutes\nwhich is honestly almost exactly\ni think i was 40 minutes off of first\nuh last year at belgian waffle so but i\ndid get\n26th overall sixth in my age group\nmy normalized power for the whole six\nhours 34 minutes was\n245 watts that's 3.5 watts per kilo\nnormalized\nthat's a lot uh energy wise i burned\n5000 calories\nyou know had a huge day on the bike and\nlook there's no vegan excuses because i\nrode to the best of my potential\ni only have vegan excuses when something\nhappens that stops me from\ndoing what i know i could have done my\npower\nmy energy my the way i rode physically\nwas about as the best i could have\nexpected\nand so i can't be down about that at all\nmy boy travis\nyou know he was drives all the way out\nhere this was a big event for him he was\nready for it he had trained for it\nand then he had no luck uh cole kessler\nalso super strong no luck i mean there\nwere so many people\nthat had so many issues and\ni didn't have any of those issues right\ni mean i had my own little issues\nbut nothing that stopped me from being\nthe best i could physically be and i\nknow i make a lot of excuses sometimes\nbut the thing is that i don't care if i\nget\nlast place if i get lapped a hundred\ntimes\nin a one mile crit if i did the best i\nknow i\nphysically could do that if i lived up\nto my potential\ni'm always going to be happy with that\nand so with\nhow much this trip cost and how much\ntime we put into it and how i was away\nfrom my family for so long\nthere was a lot of pressure to not\ncompletely suck\nand so to do better than i did last year\nso bwr i got 40th last year was one of\nmy most proudest results\nand then to get 26th here this year um\nto do well\ni am i'm just super proud of it man i'm\nsuper stoked on this\nand again maybe in the beginning i could\nhave done a little more to\nhave been further up the road\nbut if i was with that front group i\njust can't imagine\nthat i could have stayed with them given\nhow hard i had to ride\nfor 26th place the amount of support\nthat i got from\ncanyon from irc from elio\nuh was huge uh so i just want to say a\nhuge thank you to those guys\nand just the event you know michael\nmarks he puts on a phenomenal event\nthe belgian waffle like ethos is just\nyou know the hardest one day ride uh\never and it just lives up to that i mean\nthis course was phenomenal it was one of\nmy favorite courses i've ever ridden\nbecause there wasn't any huge um\nphysical deciders until the very end so\nyou could if you had some technical\nskills and you had some good base\nfitness\nyou could feel competitive all the way\ninto that last climb\nand so i thought it was a really fair\nand and like overall\ngood course can't wait to do it next\nyear guys i hope you enjoyed the video\num i'm really proud of this result if\nyou want to go back and watch the four\ndays leading up to this i\ndaily vlogged you know our little trip\nleading into this\nand as always guys vegan cyclists",

          "transcript": "[Music]\nn\nall right here we are Cedar City one day\nout from the Belgian waide Utah\nyeah last year was a good year got ninth\nhere so I'm pretty excited for this race\nthis year they decided to spice it up a\nlittle bit more I believe last year they\nwere going to add some single track a\nbunch of people started complaining and\nthey took it out I just got done riding\nit and I 100% see why those people were\ncomplaining about it pretty techy\nprobably the most technical single track\nI have ridden in bwr and I've done this\none I've done Kansas and I've done Cali\nnow however I love it being a mountain\nbiker I think it'll be a good Advantage\nfor me for me how many miles is the race\ntomorrow 127 mil in the past it's been a\nlittle over 6 hours however this is\ndefinitely going to add a little bit of\ntime yeah um I'm excited for the race\nthis is this one suits me well I hold\nthis one near and dear been ninth twice\ndone this race twice but if I get ninth\ntomorrow I'm going to be real mad so I'm\neither getting top five or I'm getting\n30th so going go SCH I don't like that\nanswer okay why would you say 30th\nbecause we're going to go for it\num not going to go over the whole bike\num but Just Tires running the pelli\ncentur a gravel H's and a size 40 Tor\ninserts 33 in the front 35 in the rear\nPSI um that's all you need to know\nalready got some pancakes made for\nbreakfast so trying to take a book out\nof\nbook P try try and take a book out of\nKeegan's page here pancakes for\nbreakfast and 100% pure maple syrup is\nthe key ingredient there right all right\nlet's do this let's do\nthis why is this\nhappening hello and good evening this is\nKendra ghetto here reporting live from\nCedar City reporting on the Belgian\nwaffle ride of 202 23 starting tomorrow\nat 7 a.m. um should take them hopefully\nunder 7 hours believe yeah opening the\ncome home with a\nPodium that's all I have for you I like\nthe\nWiggle all right so seven bottles 1 2 3\n4 6 7 these\n7even scratch super high car 400\ncalories 100 G carbs a bottle that\nbottle regular I'm going to start with\nthat one and this one and the plan is to\nget one of these at each stop then just\nuh mix between scratched sh and liquid\nGoose probably mostly these I like these\nliquid they go down super easy also\nthough I'm going to carry some extra of\nthese just in case something goes wrong\nand my wifey doesn't make it to one of\nthe eight stations or something happens\nalways good to have the extra fuel\nnumbers on the bike\ndown here because arrow is everything\nthey said don't bend it I didn't bend it\nit's flat it's just a more arrowy\nflat good morning it's\nRy all right just got to get the pins on\nherea on the other side\nall right here we are inside the Belgium\nW for ride Cedar City just got through\nthe tunnel at Mile 4 the first year I\ndid it I thought that'd be pretty big\npinch point but as long as you're up top\n50 Riders honestly you're pretty fine\nthere's really four key points in this\nrace um I've identified that I want to\nbe at the front and the first one is\ncoming up here at Mile 19 as we head\ninto the first real off-road section\nI made it through the first few zigzags\nof this off-road section and I'm slotted\nin nicely in third wheel as we start the\nfirst k this climb took a total of 8\nminutes and 49 seconds to get up and I\naveraged 351 for the total duration with\nthe last 2 and 1/2 minutes or so at 432\nWatts um so nothing too crazy here as we\ngot to the top I did sag back just a\nlittle bit but I did want to stay up far\nenough just to stay out of trouble if\nthere was a crash or anything\nhe\nand with that the first decisive section\nis down and we cruise to the first aid\nstation I pick up a bottle from my wife\nof some super Fuel and from here we kind\nof form a nice group on the\nroad Carter and one other Rider were off\nthe front but as we all begin to rotate\nquite nicely together it doesn't take us\ntoo long to catch them and we enter the\nnext section which is 12 Mi of flat to\nRolling Hills nothing crazy here um I\nthink it took us about 30 minutes to get\nthrough this section and add a\nnormalized power of about 248 watt so\nmainly just trying to conserve here as\nthe next section of the race proves to\nbe one of the hardest Parts it's called\nthe bald Hills and it's a Jeep Trail\nwith a slight incline going up but it's\nsuper Rocky and if you get just a little\nbit off your line um you can get kind of\nhung up so in the years past this has\nalways blown the field apart and it's\nbeen the deciding sector of what becomes\nthe main lead group for the rest of the\nday\nmakee\nwee make a\nmexic God damn it\n[Applause]\nwell as you can see things kind of went\na little bit to here this was the\nthird of the four places that I wanted\nto be at the front of the race and I was\nright in the right spot coming in um but\nCody came up the inside and I kind of\nmessed up my line wasn't in the right\ngear and couldn't pedal and fell over\nthen l Lally got passed by everyone and\nat this point in my head I am slightly\nthinking that my race is over in years\npast the sand section has lasted super\nlong fortunately for me this year it\nreally wasn't that bad all the moisture\nthey've had has really kept it more\npacked down I did have to put in a huge\neffort to get back up but I was able to\ncatch back up with the front and\neveryone was kind of riding on the right\nside and I just knew that there was\nanother tough little Andy Hill coming um\nafter this left turn so I popped myself\nin the left lane and got right back\nwhere I needed to be um into the front\nof the\nrace always on go feel like I'm never I\nget S SW time to Let It Go got me going\ndumb like I'm illiterate know you\nfeeling it I got you feeling this heat\nride have you ever stayed up to the\nsunshine\ntole all right this is the fourth and\nfinal key point I decided that I want to\nbe at the front of the race as we enter\nthe new single\ntrack do you believe in those monsters\nI'm talking dreams so big that they\nhaunt you or they C you just how you\nknow if you got go and get it get to\nwinning I conquer I had to go out and\nget it without a sponsor kept it real\nnever crooked yeah that's honor now I\ncan go out and get it how I want to #\nbless\nI always on go feel like I'm never home\nit's song SW It's Time to Let It Go got\nme going dumb like I'm illiterate know\nyou feeling it I got you feeling this he\nR have you ever stayed up to the\nsunshine came through fourth quarter in\nthe CR time need to go fle on the just\none time have a fun\ntime know you feeling it I got you\nfeeling it\nknow you feeling it I got you feeling it\nI'm growing way up like to the Moon get\nup and get it your eyes Z money keep\nfall I need a room my sweep straight off\nthe humble I don't tweet family around\nme don't say a PE got what you need so\nwhat you need I'm in the Earth Play My\nseas and I watch them grow till I say my\npeace know you feeling it I got you\nfeeling it Mar tell me do you believe in\nthose monsters I'm talking dreams so big\nthat they a Haun or they Cal you that's\nhow you know if you got to go and get it\nget to winning not conquer I had to go\nout and get it without a sponsor kept it\nreal never crook that's honor now I can\ngo out and get it how I want to # bless\nI all right we are through the single\ntrack I made three little mistakes in\nthere um that cost me three positions so\nI come out on the road in sixth position\nhowever Drew got a little confused used\nand tried to yell him to go straight so\nnow I'm in fifth here however I can see\nin front of me that there's one guy off\nthe front and then a group of three\nchasing him then I'm by myself um so I\ndon't really want to go one against\nthree I do look back and I see that Drew\nand yonas are pretty close so I decided\nto sit up a little bit and wait for them\nto uh kind of hammer it out with I try\nencourage them I'm like hey if we work\npretty strong we can catch on then then\nwe can sit for just a little bit while\nwe uh catch our breaths and then we'll\nbe in the lead group um however pretty\nquickly after the Motocross section I\ncould see that they were starting to\ntake a little bit lesser pulls and then\nstarted telling me that they couldn't\npull through just a little bit give me a\nlittle right there so I definitely had\nto do the line share of the work here\nand this cost me quite a bit of energy\nbut I knew I had to be in that group if\nI wanted a shot at a podium\nready to\nlose know\ntomorrow so\nmuch without\nyour Drew fell off the back of me and\nyonas was able to stay on my wheel and\nthen we caught up and became the lead\ngroup of six Riders this effort to get\nback on the lead Group after the single\ntrack took just under 22 minutes with an\naverage power of 293 normalized 306 in\ntotal from the end of the single track\nto the top of this false flat climb took\n53 minutes average power 278 with\nnormalized\n288 um the temperatures were definitely\nstarting to heat up and fatigue was for\nsure setting in\nhere in total this climb is just over 5\nm long and if you look at the profile\nit's super mellow until the last half\nmile where it kicks up brenen put in a\nnice kick and I fell off the back of the\ntop three Riders and I definitely have\nmy work cut out for me going down this\nnext downhill\nhere ready to lose your\nmind know tomorrow\nwe ready to\nL know tomorrow\nyou\nlose let's go go you got this water\nwater here we are mile 102 just about 5\nhours in approaching the canar BG climb\nright now we're actually just a group of\nfour so it's Carter Tasman Brendan and\nmyself after that last feed Zone Cody\nactually was still riding but pulled\nover the side and puking apparently he\nsomething he took from the feed Zone\njust didn't drive well with him and he\njust puked right back up so feeling\npretty secure in the top five which was\nmy for sure goal of the day hitting the\nbottom of the canberg climb it is 95° at\nthe base no wind whatsoever pretty\nquickly on though Brendan attacked and I\nhad known that he was definitely the\nstrongest guy in the race and knowing\nwhat this climb has and how hot it is I\ndidn't try and go with them I just kind\nof kept conservative from here Carter\nsurged ahead a bit I was hoping I could\nkind of stay with him but I just wanted\nto make sure I could get up this climb\nwithout cramping um Cody actually caught\nback up to us um but I was able to\ndistance him this climb took 20 minutes\nand 14 seconds for me to get up at an\naverage of 292 Watts yeah 5 hours in and\n95° this was just all I had in the tank\nover the top Brandon had put in a pretty\nsizable Gap Carter was the next guy over\nthe top top and I was sitting about 35\nseconds off him and then Cody was\nanother 35 seconds down on me so as far\nas the uh battle for the wind goes\nBrendan had a pretty good Gap but the\nbattle for uh second through fourth was\nuh pretty tight one here\nhere we are just at the end of the\nsingle track on a couple switchbacks I\ncan see that Cody is actually catching\nup to me so I decided to send it a\nlittle bit harder in hopes that I can\nget on the road by myself and maintain\nthe Gap that I have for third place\nI\nfor I go on forever chees and coffee\nstain somewhere in brok you made me\nyoung\nagain LS turning into change\nI don't one day all will\nchange all right I'm currently sitting\nin third place with a little bit of gap\non Cody with not much to go however I\nmake a pretty huge mistake here as I\nmiss a turn to go straight there was\nsome road construction going on and cars\nin the left lane and I totally missed\nthe sign right here that says to go\nstraight and curve right and and started\nheading to a neighborhood luckily I\nnoticed it right away on my map and knew\nthat something was off so I slowed down\nturned around didn't see the\nintersection so I was a bit confused on\nwhere I was supposed to go but as I was\ngetting back to the spot Cody went by\nand then I knew I'd be back on track I\nmiss that so join back up with him not\ngoing to lie I was super deflated here\nas I knew I had a really good shot of\nstaying away as I'm pretty powerful\nRider just on the flat roads\nunfortunately my GoPro dies shortly\nafter this here what happens is we're\ngoing down a little bit of a hill I mess\nup this turn going into the dirt section\nCody puts a bit of a gap on me and then\nwe proceed into the last off-road\nsection and there's some pretty gnarly\nwash outs he is completely sending it\nthrough there and putting more of a gap\non me in my head I'm thinking I've got\nfourth place locked up um third would be\namazing but I really don't want to mess\nthis up with the flat or anything so I\ntake it pretty conserv through this last\ndirt section hoping that I can reel Cody\nin on the way back into town however\nthere was a little bit of a leg as I got\nstuck behind a stoplight that he was\nable to make it through however he rode\npretty darn strong all the way to the\nfinish so I'm not sure if I would have\ncaught him regardless of the stoplight\nsituation I roll in here for fourth\nplace final spot on the podium will be\nfor this griman there he is Joe go will\nplay with the shields Utah right out of\nSandy Utah\nand we're getting closer let's give it\nup for Joe\ngetto Joe taking fourth place today for\nShields\nUtah more discussion super TR\ndocumentary um super happy take care of\nthis did the husband come through today\nhe did come through he just took a wrong\nturn but that's all\nright well we did\nit top five Podium a little bummed they\ncame out of a single track and\nthird and I was putting the power down\non the\nroad and took a wrong turn realized I\ndid that turn around dilly d cuz I\ncouldn't really figure out where I was\ngoing and then I saw Cody Cup going by\nthat was like however fourth\nplace much improved over 3 nths at bwrs\n29ths here and uh yeah I'm stoked on\nthat probably doesn't look like am as\nhappy just because of the M turn\nbut hey side still stoked what on the\nplus side it wasn't taking a wrong turn\nto miss going to State yes I did do that\nwhen when I was a senior in high school\nI missed a turn I was in third I got 11\nthat Hab it\nyeah h",

The race starts cold at 40 degrees with a critical tunnel pinch point at mile 4 that creates crashes and dust visibility issues. Riders need to be in the top 50 to avoid problems. The first major climb at mile 19 is decisive, requiring 8+ minutes at high watts. A technical single track section at mile 115 advantages mountain bikers. Gravel feels much rougher at race pace (25-30 mph) than pre-riding speeds. Course has sections with rocks and holes hit at high speed with little warning. Recommended setup includes 40-42mm tires, tire inserts for flat protection, and lower pressures (27-29 psi). Race goes from no warm-up to full gas immediately, making positioning crucial early."
