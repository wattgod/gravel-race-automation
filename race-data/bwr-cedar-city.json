Four feed zones for 117 miles is proper support. When weather forced a course shortening in 2024, they adapted instead of canceling—that's operational maturity."

        "explanation": "Forum discussions show equipment debates and course file sharing, but it's more transactional than tribal.

        "explanation": "Pete Stetina, Keegan Swenson, Sofia Gomez Villafane, and Rose Grant on the winner's list tells you the caliber. 600+ riders in the inaugural year shows it attracts numbers, not just names. Being part of the Quad-Tripel Crown means traveling pros treat it seriously, not as a training ride."

        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "117 miles of new terrain, four feed zones, and access to Utah's high desert for a weekend makes the entry fee work. The Quad-Tripel Crown deal adds value if you're doing multiple BWR events. Cedar City isn't Aspen-expensive, so lodging won't destroy your budget."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Cedar City keeps costs reasonable compared to resort destinations, and tiered early registration pricing helps if you plan ahead. The challenge is getting to southern Utah—it's not exactly a hub airport situation. Factor in potential gear needs for altitude and temperature swings, but overall expenses stay manageable."

      "length": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "117 miles hits the sweet spot for gravel suffering—long enough to separate pretenders from contenders, short enough that mortals can finish before dark. The 66.5-mile Wafer option gives beginners an out without embarrassment. At 5,800 feet average elevation, those miles feel longer than sea level equivalents."

      "technicality": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "The 2026 course removes 'crazy singletrack' but keeps sandy sectors and rocky jeep roads that demand skill. 60% unroad means equipment choices matter—ENVE pros switched from aero wheels to G23s for good reason. Sandy washboard sections separate Bay Area riders from desert veterans."

        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "5,940 feet of climbing over 117 miles isn't Leadville brutal, but it's steady work. Starting at 5,846 feet means you're already thin on oxygen before you begin climbing. The elevation profile shows consistent rolling rather than massive single climbs—death by a thousand cuts."
      },
      "climate": {
        "score": 5,
        "explanation": "June in Cedar City delivers 12.73 hours of sunshine, 77-86°F highs, and only 2.73 precipitation days all month—basically perfect gravel weather. 26% humidity keeps you dry but demands serious hydration strategy. When the 2024 edition got snow and high winds, it was weather, not climate—June eliminates that variable."
      },
      "altitude": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "5,846 feet starting elevation makes this the highest BWR start, and you'll feel it in your lungs combined with 26% humidity. It's not Colorado brutal, but sea level riders need acclimatization time or suffer accordingly. The thin air amplifies every effort, especially when dust kicks up."
      },
      "logistics": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Cedar City isn't exactly a transportation hub—you're driving from Salt Lake or flying into smaller regional airports. The town handles 600+ riders fine, but accommodation options are limited compared to major cities. Course files going private in 2020 showed some early organizational hiccups that seem resolved."
      },
      "adventure": {
        "score": 5,
        "explanation": "Red rock valleys, sandy sectors, and rocky jeep roads at altitude in Utah's high desert—this is why gravel exists. The terrain 'never quite settles into comfort' across 117 miles of constantly changing surfaces. Starting cool and finishing hot under massive desert skies delivers the full Western experience most riders never see."
