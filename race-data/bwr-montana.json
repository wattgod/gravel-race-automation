Uh this is the\nfinal stop. So yeah, um lots to play for\non Sunday and looking to try to win the\nrace and win the overall. I think that'd\nbe pretty good weekend. I'm not saying\nthe Bose. I'll say Bose Angeles before I\ncall it the Bose Zone. All right, we're\nup here in Big Sky Country, Boseman,\nMontana for the last stop of the Belgian\nWaffle Ride Triple Crown series.\n[Music]\n[Applause]\nThis weekend we have a really unique\nproblem in America. There's three really\ngood gravel races going on. So, it was\nvery hard to choose which race to go to.\nOver in Oregon, you have the Oregon\nTrail stage race going on. There's also\nSBT gravel going on this weekend in\nSteamboat. And then BWR Montana. Um,\nwhen I saw the BWR schedule come out uh\nlast winter, it was honestly the race I\nwas kind of the most excited about on\nthe schedule just cuz it was a a new\nevent. So, I just thought it'd be cool\nto go to and kind of on a whim last\nminute decided let's head to Montana.\nLittle bit of pre-ride action going down\ntoday. Going to go see what that single\ntrack business is all about.\nGet Cindy out there. Maybe pick up the\npackets.\ncome home, meet some carves, call it a\nday.\nI look to Belgian waffle rides as events\nthat um really bring the best courses\nthat we race on all season. They they're\nthe most um encompassing of everything\nthat I think um gravel racing should be.\nLike you have a lot of single track out\nthere. Um just challenging unroad\nsectors that pop up out of nowhere. Um\nyeah, for me they're just the most fun\nraces. So, um I always try to sprinkle a\nfew of them in just to get to race on\nthe terrain I really enjoy racing on.\nThat's pretty good. You need one, too.\nYeah, feel free. Enjoy.\nI think it'll probably like break up\ninto like it'll slowly break up into a\nsmall group all day and probably be I\nwouldn't be surprised if it's like three\nor four guys going into that single\ntrack. Pretty straightforward, but you\nnever know 100 miles into a race what\ncan happen in the single track. So, four\nmay enter, but who knows how many will\ncome out.\nIt's a lot of corners to blow. Yeah. Go\nand do it with Dax and Lance. You're\nprobably going to come out of it with\nDax and Lance.\nAlmost got it. I need to work on my\nvert.\nDid you see this? 10% off on bike\nflights using code Montana 10 for the\nrest of the month.\nNot what we're after.\nFeel like you're the one to ask. I got\nJ1 RS on right now at 45.\nI feel like there's so much road it's\nworth going. So, what do you think?\nYeah. 45 versus these are 45. These are\n45. They're just RS's. Nice. What's the\nI don't really know Schwab's line very\nwell. Uh, I tell you,\nwhat are you running? Both look pretty\ngood. I'm running Teras 45s. You're on\n45s? Yeah, these. Yeah. Yeah. Little\nknob up front wouldn't be the worst\nthing. That's true. Thank you. Yep. Of\ncourse.\nI definitely put a lot of my eggs in the\nlifetime basket and consider those kind\nof like my A events for the year. Um, I\ngo to every one of those looking for um\njust the best performance possible out\nof myself. Um, and that's that's no\ndifferent this weekend, but it's\ndefinitely a different level of pressure\nfor me. Like I'm truly here in Montana\nbecause I want to be racing my bike in\nMontana and um just here to enjoy the\nweekend. Um, experience a new town. Um,\nand just uh a different level of like\npressure and intensity being away from a\na lifetime event. And I think it's good\nfor me to do events like this cuz it\njust kind of balances everything out.\nDude, there's no way I'm going to be\nable to do this.\nNot a chance. Not ready for a race. No,\nwe're hanging it up. We're going to put\nthat. Dude, you want to try it? Sure.\nLet's see. I don't think I'm going to be\nvery good at it either, cuz I I stay\naway from those things. Oh, look. Dude,\nthat was pretty good. One hole pedal\nstroke revolution. We got to turn. Yeah,\nwe can round it up to one hole.\nOh, yeah. Oh, yeah.\nDude, this might as well be the rodeo.\nAre you really missing James right now?\nYeah, he's\nhe's nice to have. When was the last\ntime you washed your own bike? Before\nBelgium Waffle Ride California.\nSeems to be a theme here at Belgium\nWaffle Ride. Do my own mechanical work\nfor for better or worse. Mostly for\nworse cuz I had mechanicals because of\nme at California. Really? What happened?\nMy skewer backed out. No, dude.\nBasic basic bike. And dude, I I'll I'll\nadmit I didn't even check it before the\nrace. That's why I told you today I'm\ndoing a bolt check.\nGet all the poop off the down tube.\nAre you qualified to operate that? I I\nreally don't think so. Lefty loosey\nrighty tighty.\nIs it in\nthat dog wheel hunt? Dude, do you think\nit's worth taking the Garmin Mario mount\noff for the race? It seems lazy to not\ntake it off. So, you would you would\ntake it off? Yeah. Got to ask yourself,\nwhat would Keegan do?\nHe would have Myron take it off.\nOh, I made my nutrition plan already.\nSo, I make a bottle and make it easy.\nThey have figured out the number\nsituation here, which is pretty dope.\nAll right, I think I'm done out here.\nSo, we got one, two, three, 4, 5, 6, 7,\n8.\nYeah, the finish is pretty hard. Dude,\nhere's that steep little climb we saw.\nIt looks like it keeps going after that.\nWhat are you doing? Looking at the\nweather. Looking at the wind.\nYou don't do like the finger in your\nmouth.\nwhile I'm out riding. It's normally\nheadwind I found when you do that\nsubtle tailwind home. Dude, this zone\ndoes look really spiky. Look at\neverything else we rode and it's like\npretty like real smooth spikes. Yeah,\nthis zone has spikes. Those are jagged\nspikes. I think it's the things with\nlittle teeth that always hurt. Going\ninto Sunday with the lead of the Triple\nCrown, I wouldn't say it's um\nnecessarily like the focus of the\nweekend. Um first and foremost, want to\ntry to win the bike race. that's always\nlike the most fun and exciting to me.\nSo, um definitely not going to be racing\ndefensively of the overall. I would say\ntry to be um just throwing blows and try\nto win the dang thing.\nAll right, ladies and gentlemen, here we\ngo. We have a Allstar Field Riders on\ntop here\ncontest\nin five 4 3 2 1. Don't try and say I\ndidn't\nshoot it at those caves in California.\nYou got a knife. Well, I've got a gun.\nIf you're going to walk and I'm going to\nrun right over You\nstay away from me.\nGo ahead. I'll let you take the first\npunch.\nCuz honey, I know you ain't got much.\nYou're going down in front of your\nfriends. You try to get up. I'll knock\nyour ass out again. I need all this.\nTake the money. You son of a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I'm\nstay away from\nWell, we're still on this pretty long\nclimb out to the second beat zone, which\nis like mile 37. And then after that,\nthey've really got a lot of rolling\ndownhill all the way back into town,\nwhich will make that next 30 m a lot\neasier. Right now, we're going to catch\nup to him on K number two.\nRisk your resistible.\nThis is nothing.\nMichael, what was the gap? 2 minutes and\n30 seconds. Oh man, they better start\nriding. Yeah. Well, they peeled back a\nlittle bit of it, but that's still a big\ngap, but it's going to go fast. So,\nlet's get in the car and go. Yeah.\nHeat. Heat.\nYou're racist\nabout\nIt\nseems like they pulled some back. Yeah.\nYeah. That was only a minute and a half.\nOh, wow. So, they took like a minute and\na half out. Yeah. I guess they decided\nto ride\nHeat.\nI\nwonder\nwhy\nI need my\nbre\nin the excess.\nMake it stop.\nI need you.\nOh,\nheat, heat.\nThere's the\nwinner. And there's Jackson.\nLance is going to take third place.\nThat all came together really quickly\nthere. Good job to Lance Her in third\nplace. Luke Mel from Bear National is\ngoing to take fifth.\nSo we have Joe Hawk in third last\nmeeting in fourth.\nwent for it.\nDude, give me the low down on that. Was\nit stressful? Did you mean to let that\ngroup go up the road so far or what? Uh,\nnot really.\nIt was holding steady at like a minute\nand a half and you could kind of see him\nand I was like, \"Okay, a minute and a\nhalf's not so bad.\" And then then all of\na sudden it was 3 minutes and we kept it\nrolling the whole time like pulling\nthrough at like 300, 330 and the gap\nwasn't coming back down at all. It was\njust staying like 3 minutes. So for a\nwhile I was a little worried. Um but\nthen we got it down to like a minute and\na half, minute 20 and same kind of\nthing. It just stayed there for a while.\nUm, but I think they all got separated\non the road. Um, and I think we kind of\nturned it up a little bit there at the\nend. Um, and we're able to like it all\ncame back together in the single track.\nDude, I thought Luke Luke was dying,\ndude. Yeah, he was turning himself. It\nwas cool. Yeah, I could tell it was like\na 40se secondond gap and I was like, 10\nm 40 seconds. Like, we're going into a\nheadwind right now. Like, that's a lot\nto hold on to. So, I was kind of\nconfident we could bring it back, but I\nknew it was going to be tight. It was it\nwas tight. And then yeah, we did a\nadventurous sprint for the whole shot of\nthe single track and we were sending\nthat downhill and definitely found the\nedge of 45 gravel tires.\nDax and I came out of the single track\ntogether. I don't know how much of a gap\nwe had, but you couldn't see anybody\nbehind us. Uh, and we were playing kind\nof the cat and mouse thing. Um, and\nLance was coming in pretty hot. Um, so I\nhad to launch pretty early just cuz I\nfelt like Lance was going to catch us.\nSo I went a little early and luckily Dax\num was pretty dead. So able to peace\nout. Now what? Adventure day, dude.\nLakes to go check out.\nYou feeling too tight tie after your day\nin the side by side? Dude, I was sitting\nall day. So were you, I guess. Oh, I was\nsitting too.\nDude, that Silka drivetrain still\nsounded mint.\nFounder Michael Mars just reminded me\nthat this is the closest finish ever of\na top five. And all 35 BWRs, these five\nriders all came in with 25 seconds with\neach other.\nGo get them, Tiger.\nAnd your winner presiding from Colorado\ntripless\nRussell Fster.\nThere you have it. Ladies and gentlemen,\nthe here of the day,\nMontana. Getting out of here now. Yeah.\nLet's make like a fetus and head out.\nWhat are we doing tomorrow? I feel like\npeople want to know what adventure day\nis.\nGoing wild and out in the mountains,\ndude. Most people take a day off after a\nbig adventure, but Russell Fster Wall,\nbut Carrie's got gravel triathlon\nnationals he's training for. Dude, I\nwasn't going to unveil that yet.\nCat's out of the bag. So, we got to ride\nup to the lake so you can get your swim\nin.\nWelcome to adventure day\nland mine. She's got to work something\nout.\nHave you ever felt collide?\nshaking knees and laughing.\nHolding\nwill not\ndude. Go get your swim on.\nGravel try National Championships is\ncoming.\nHolding fast ain't something I'm good\nat. When the ground breaks.\nAll right, hold the cam.\nDo a lap.\nI think you got to jump in with your\nhelmet, shoes,\neverything. Gravel world the end of\nAugust. We'll see who comes out with the\nnumber one result.\nNational champion. If you're lucky, you\ncan call yourself the captain of the\ngravel seas, but\nI like my chances.\nI think you got good odds.\nLittle cold.\nThree, two, one, go.\nYou just got to send it.

          "transcript": "[Music]\nA poor boy from the backwoods thought I\nnever would find my way.\nSweet girl spay from downtown where I\nwas just another face.\nThey said that we should stay clear of\neach other. Matches and gasoline.\nNothing but trles. Said we never make\nit. But you ain't seen nothing.\nWe just getting started.\nWe just\nsouthbound for the border. Somewhere no\none knows our names. But I know when I\nhold you, I'mma love you till the grave.\nAll right, mic's on. We're ready.\n&gt;&gt; Ready. Cool.\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; All right, so it is Saturday today. Race\nday tomorrow. Um, got to check out the\nlast little loop of the course\nyesterday, which was all road with a\nshort little punchy steep climb and then\nabout eight miles of single track within\nthe last 10 mi of the race. Um, then we\njust drove all the way out here. So,\nwe're at roughly mile 30 on course and\nso far it's been a lot of road and a lot\nof really smooth gravel.\nI think for a BWR, I was expecting it to\nbe a little bit rougher and gnarlier,\nand we haven't seen super far back yet,\nbut so far, it's definitely looking to\nbe like a fast kind of road racy style\nrace, but there are a ton of rollers, so\nit's definitely not going to be an easy\nrace. Yeah, I think it's going to be\npretty fun. Pretty interesting how it\ngoes. So, anyways, I came up here not\nknowing exactly what the course was\ngoing to be like, so I've got my bike\nall set up with a more conservative\nsetup. I've got the Envy Hex 48 up front\nand a Prell Gravel H in the rear in a\n45. This is a pretty quick tire and I\nlike these a lot, but they do lack grip.\nSo, I wanted to go with the Envy Hex up\nfront to have a bit more grip. With that\nsingle track being right at the end,\nthere are a few little slippery spots\nand we're going to be just pinning it\nwhen we're super tired. So, I think I'm\ngoing to keep this tire on uh just to be\na little bit safer there. Other than\nthat, the main thing you're going to\nnotice with my bike that's different\nfrom all the other races is I have\nswitched to the new XTR setup. So, I've\ngot a Wolftooth 50 chain ring up front\nand then I've got a 10 to a 51 cassette\nin the rear. This thing is pretty\nbulletproof and for the single track at\nthe end, this is definitely going to be\nnicer to have than the two by setup. So,\nI think having a bike setup for the most\nimportant parts of the race, which\nthat's going to be super important at\nthe end there, um is one of the keys.\nAnd I think this is going to be a pretty\ngood weapon for uh the race. Uh plan\nright now is we're going to finish\ndriving out to what's going to be aid\nstation two. And then I'm going to run\nthe last kind of far out loop for my\nopeners and see what that's all like.\nAnd then we're going to drive into the\nfinish. So I pretty much know every inch\nof this course. Um as doing the recon\nsuper important to know what's coming\nup. So,\n&gt;&gt; how you guys doing?\n&gt;&gt; I would just say this hard pack has a\nlot of kitty litter on top.\n&gt;&gt; And you feel it.\n&gt;&gt; I mean, there's that first turn.\n&gt;&gt; We almost overshot in the car.\n&gt;&gt; Oh, gotcha.\n&gt;&gt; It looks like Colorado roads to me. You\nknow, like the\n&gt;&gt; smooth. Beautiful.\n&gt;&gt; Yes. Yeah. And you find a few rocks\nshowing up here and there, but nothing\nis loose and chuck chunky or sharp.\n&gt;&gt; It's going to be super nice.\n&gt;&gt; All right. So, we are\nmile something on the course way out the\nback lollipop. Again, so far nothing\ncrazy. There was one minimum maintenance\nroad we just drove down where there are\nsome rocks kind of embedded the ground\nhere and there, but really not too\nchunky at all. Like it's just a really\namazing, beautiful, nice course.\n&gt;&gt; Light is going to guide you, baby. So\nlet it rain on your spine. Close to your\nheart.\nThat's some skills.\nTell me\nwhat every light is going to go.\nThis one in here and this one right\nhere. So flowers, do they add flavor or\nthey just purely visual or is there like\nan energy they add to the thing?\n&gt;&gt; I don't know. Let's go with all of it.\n&gt;&gt; All of it.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. All day above.\n&gt;&gt; Flavor, visual, and energy. Trip ship.\nAll right. So, we're trying to go as\nfast as possible tomorrow. Silica sent\nus this awesome chain waxing crockpot\ndealy. So, we're using the strip chip\nbecause I haven't cleaned my chain since\nit was brand new when I got it. So, we\ngot the wax melting and then we got the\nstrip chip on top. Now we can put a\nchain with some grease on the end here\nversus having to fully degrease it\nbefore putting it in. So, oh wait, no.\nSo, gently lower the chain using the\ncable coupler into the wax and lightly\nagitate for 30 seconds. Then you leave\nit in for 10 minutes. And then after\nthat, you pull it out and you let it sit\nlike this for 10 to 15 minutes before\nyou install it back on your bike.\nAll righty. So, it's race day morning.\nWalking a little R right now. Got my\npancakes done. Did a little bit of Paint\nAcademy movement. I always like to do\nthat in the morning just to open up the\nbody a little bit. And yeah, it's quite\nnice out. Just a little bit brisk. High\nof 75 today, so pretty much perfect\ntemps. Um, not a cloud in sight right\nnow. So, yeah. Uh, things are looking\nlooking like it's going to be a good\nday.\nHello. Hello. Hi. Oh, you so excited to\nsee me already? I've only been gone for\n5 minutes.\nReady?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. Are you ready? Nice job, Rocky.\nWater, I'll walk right out that door.\nCome high water, I'll make you miss me\nno more.\nCome high water, I'll tie you to this\ntrack.\nCome high water, I'll leave you, never\nlook back.\nCome hell, high water, I'm going to make\nyou love me.\nAfter a quick neutral roll out, we are\nnow underway with VWR Montana, the\nfourth and final stop of the 2025\nQuadruple Crown. Now, before I dive into\nthe course, I want to go over a couple\nof the players that are here. both\nriders I'll be looking out for for this\nrace and then for the overall quadruple\ncrown series as the win that I had in\nUtah moved me up a little bit and I'm\nnow within striking distance of getting\non that top five overall podium but I'd\nstill say the main goal is a top five or\nbetter in today's race. Now, let's start\nwith the big three, as in Russell\nFinerwald, probably my number one guy to\nwatch, second place at PWR, Arizona, and\nhad a really great ride in California,\nso he is leading the series and is\nprobably the strongest guy here. Next\nup, we got Lance Hayd, who has also had\nsome pretty solid races this year and is\nin second in the series. And then we\nhave Daxton Mock, who maybe spent a\nlittle bit too much energy at the last\nrace in Utah, but beat me in Arizona and\nCalifornia. and I'm definitely looking\nout for him as one of the strongest guys\nagain in the race if he rides it\nsmartly. Now, a couple other riders to\nwatch out for are going to be Alexi\nCartiier, master of going in the\nbreakaway, so we expect to see him up\nthere. Cody Cup, who is a fellow racer\non Good Life with me and a strong guy\nthat was there all the way to the last\nclimb in Utah. Then we got Luke\nMustellar, who is Daxton's teammate, who\nI've heard is not as strong as Daxton,\nbut still maybe someone to keep an eye\nout for. And then we have Nate Nolles,\nwho is ahead of me in the quadruple\ncrown. So, he was someone I was trying\nto look out for. However, he got a\npretty catastrophic flat tire early on\nand did not finish the race. So, that is\ngoing to end his bid for the overall\nplacing in the quadruple crown for 2025.\nSo, breaking down this inaugural BWR\nMontana course, it is going to be 111 mi\nwith 8,000 ft of climbing and 60% is\ngoing to be off-road. Now, for the first\n100 miles, it's pretty smooth gravel, it\ndoes get a little bit deep, kind of\npower robbing at times, but for the most\npart, there is nothing technical here.\nWhile 8,000 ft for the whole course is\nquite a bit of climbing, there's no real\nlong sustained climbs, but rather a\nbunch of short two to five minute kind\nof punchy rollers over and over again.\nSo, this is right up my wheelhouse and\nhas me very excited for the day as I can\nplay to my strengths and try and wear\ndown some of the other guys. However,\nthe last 10 mi has an 8 mile section of\nsingle track leading back into town that\nis slightly downhill. And with guys like\nRussell, Lance, and Daxton, I know I'm\ngoing to have my hands full if I let\nthem all in there in front of me. So, I\nreally have to try and formulate a\nstrategy here to try and get away from\none or more of those guys before we get\ninto that single track.\nI\nsay it hurts to live this way.\nI don't mind the pain and I like to feel\nthe shame of it.\nHeat.\nIt hurts with the sway.\nI don't mind pain and I like to feel the\nshame of it.\nWith that first little test out of the\nway, I take a glance back and see that\nthis small group I'm in here has a gap\non the field and I don't see either\nLance or Nate Nolles in this group. So,\nI decide to try and press on for a\nlittle bit. However, it is just too\nearly in the race for us to make real\nseparation and the group does chase us\nback and we all decide to relax for a\nbit as we make our way to mile 22 which\nis going to bring a fourmile climb. Now,\nthe average gradient is only 5% so it's\nreally not a super tough climb and it's\ngoing to turn out to be more tactical as\na few riders go off the front including\nnone other than Alexi Cartier. And now\nthis is where I'm really having a split\ndecision on whether to chase him and try\nand go for the break or not. As I said\nbefore, I want to try and get ahead of\nthe mountain bikers in the group and\ngoing for a breakaway with Alexi could\nbe a great strategy to do it. However, I\ndo want to let you guys know that I was\nsick for 3 weeks following Unbound and\nI've only really been back to feeling\nnormal and training well again for the\nlast week and a half. So, I decide not\nto try and follow Alexi as I'm really\nunsure if I'd have the legs to stay out\nthere all day long. And then for myself,\nI'm much much better at throwing in\nthose really hard punches from time to\ntime and then just settling in in\nbetween and then chasing with a bigger\ngroup versus trying to do that long\nsustained effort with just one or two\nother riders. So, that's the strategy I\ndecided to go with and stay in the group\nas we make our way up this climb with\nAlexi and one other rider getting away\nhere.\nUh yeah, yeah.\nUh it's just you, me, and the odds. We\nstuck together. We two peas in a part.\nYou dealt a bad hand. I'm there seizing\nthe cards. Will never be separated till\nwe seeing the gods. We've been low\ntogether. High forever. Long as we go\ntogether, we'll die. We never be a\nlight. Couldn't let the darkness try you\never. Truth in my word, you I lied to\nnever end. When the world gets a little\ntoo hard. Wipe your eyes, put away your\nsorrow. When this war, I'll be leading\nthe charge. And I'll be still fighting\nfor you tomorrow. Yeah. Even with a\nblindfolder in different time zones,\ncould find my way to you with my eyes\nclosed. There's nothing between us. Go\nto Mars and Venus. Stand in front of\nevery one of them. Watch the sling and\nbe shield. Your shield in the fiercest\nbattle. I'll avenge you. I'll defend you\nfrom all these arrows. And the sword I\nwill keep you from danger. Let me be\nyour shield.\nHeat. Heat. Heat.\nLet me sh\n&gt;&gt; We just got done doing a sharp nice\nlittle effort up that last climb into\nthe feed zone in hopes of thinning down\nthis group enough to where we can start\nchasing down Allan and Alexi who have\nabout a minute gap on us right now.\nHowever, as you just saw, Luke Daxton's\nteammate went up the road and no one\ncovered him. I had just got done doing a\npretty big pull. So, I was hoping that\nsomeone else would cover this move, but\nwe all kind of just stared around at\neach other and he got up the road really\nfast, bridged up to Alexi and Allen, and\nthey are now a group of three up the\nroad and pulling away as we are still\ntoo big of a group to really work\ntogether and chase this down. So, this\nright here I'm looking back at as a big\nmistake on my part of not just going to\nshut that move down right away with\nDaxton being one of the favorites. He\ncan now just sit in and conserve energy\nwhile we are going to have to do the\nchasing. And this is going to set him up\nreally nicely to save some energy to go\ninto that last single track fresh. So,\nwith our group still being a little bit\ntoo big to work together, I'm going to\nhave to take responsibility along with\nLance and Fininsy at really putting in\nsome solid digs on any steep climbs that\nwe have coming up to try and thin this\ngroup down to about eight riders, which\nis a good number to where we can start\nrotating together to start chasing down\nthat breakaway.\nWhat could we see from the highest\nheights? What could a wings if I'm\nafraid to fly? All of the tremors that I\nhave inside got me scared.\nWill you be fair\nif we're the last to learn that we crash\nand burn and we'll never make it.\nIf the smoke don't clear, could we face\nour fear that we never make it?\nIs it a chance we're taking?\nCuz I just can't lose you.\nSo, here we are approaching the halfway\nmark of this race and we have finally\nthinned our group down small enough to\norganize a chase together just in time\nfor the headwind. However, we have a 3\nminute and 30 second gap to the leaders.\nSo, we're going to have to work really\nwell together to close this gap back\ndown before the finish\nthat we crash and burn and we'll never\nmake it.\nclear. Could we face our fear that we\nnever make it?\nCuz I just can't\nlose you.\nto learn that we crash and burn and\nwe'll never make it.\nwith this world\nIs it a chance we're taking\ncuz I just can't\nSo, here we are at mile 92 and the\nsituation on the road is we have caught\nAllan from the breakaway and that just\nleaves Alexi and Luke up the road and\nlast we heard the gap was about 1 to 1\nand 1/2 minutes. Now, we are a group of\nsix right now containing the big three,\nRussell, Lance, and Dax. And then Cody\nCup and another rider that I had not\nheard of until this race, Matthew Sana,\nwho is having a awesome ride out here\nand not missing a single turn, helping\nus chase down the breakaway. So, huge\nprops to you, Matthew, for making it\nthis far in the race and riding super\nstrong. Now, as we make our way up this\nclimb, it kind of starts out a little\nbit rolly and steady, but it's going to\nfinish off with a super nice steep kick\nthat gets us up to around 12 to 13% for\na good minute to a minute and a half if\nwe're pushing it hard. So, this is the\ncard I have been saving all race long as\nI am pretty good at that type of effort\nand I want to push it as hard as I can\nover that to try and create some\nseparation in the group. Now, it is\ngoing to be a headwind on the downhill\nand up the next hill towards that single\ntrack. So, I don't want to be completely\nalone with a group chasing me. And as we\nget into this steep section here, we see\nthat Finy's on the front and he slowly\nturns up the pace. And then I bring it\nup one more notch coming up next to him.\nAnd as I do this, he turns it up another\nnotch and we are now doing 600 watts\ngoing up this steep hill. We take a look\nback and see that we are distancing the\nothers. And I'm thinking to myself, this\nis an awesome situation. While it would\nbe pretty difficult for me to think\nabout staking with Finy in the single\ntrack and trying to beat him in the end,\nI still think this gives me a better\nshot at a higher overall placing versus\nif we are to go into that single track\nwith all of us as a big group.\nDon't leave me.\nDamn, that's an argument. We ain't even\ngot to ask who to started it. See you\nalways getting mad what the problem is.\nYou too smart not to understand common\nsense. Walking outside looking like\nastonishment. Go ahead, tell them where\nyou got the confidence. Should have\nnever let you out of the apartment.\nShould have never let you pull off in\nthat car you in. When your attitude is\nthe lease is I don't understand. Someone\ngive me a thesis with all those curves.\nNo wonder why I'm always crashing to\npieces. You like the blame. I'm the bad\nguy, baby. But I took the blame for the\nlast guy. That's enough. You had a rough\nlife. Guess that's why you like your\nrough body of my dreams. If you leave, I\npromise it be my nightmare.\n&gt;&gt; As we're pushing down the last few miles\nof this descent towards the final aid\nstation, Russell and I keep looking back\nand see that we have a group of three\nchasing us down. And this is going to be\nLance, Daxton, and Matthew. And as we\napproach this aid station here, they are\nright on our heels and then we end up\ncoming all back together. So, this is\ngoing to create a little tricky\nsituation as we still have Luke up the\nroad. So, we can't afford to mess around\nand play too many games here, but we've\nall just spent a huge effort attacking\neach other. So, it's going to be a\nlittle tricky for us to be cohesive. The\nleadup to the single track has a couple\nof rollers and Finy puts in a dig with\nabout two to go. But, this doesn't work\nas everyone chases him down. And I think\nwe are all saving ourselves for that one\nfinal match up the last roller that\nheads us straight into that single\nWell, as you guys saw, that entrance to\nthe single track did not go super well\nfor me. I thought I had it for a second,\nbut then they all came up the inside and\nI went in fourth and now they are slowly\npulling away from myself. Now all I can\ndo is ride as hard as I can while trying\nto keep it on two wheels and see if I\ncan close down on any of them in the\nfinish.\nHeat up here.\nHeat\nup here.\nRussell Vince\nand there's Jacksonville.\n&gt;&gt; That all came together really quickly\nthere\nlast in third place\nis going to take fifth.\n&gt;&gt; So we have Joe.\n&gt;&gt; All right. So we have your top five.\n&gt;&gt; We got fifth. We got the box.\n&gt;&gt; Oh, that was hard. I like I attacked,\nbut they came in my inside into the\nsingle track. I stayed with him for a\nlittle bit, but I just couldn't hang\nlike Russell,\n&gt;&gt; Jackson, and Lance.\n&gt;&gt; They're solid. Then that guy, that one,\nhe was off the front of the breakaway\n&gt;&gt; and I like almost caught him. Like I\nstarted cramping right at the end. Yeah,\nit was like inner thigh cramp. I kind of\nlike felt it like way out in the race.\nLike I wasn't too tired, but I felt the\nlegs like I think the legs just aren't\nthere right now. And I was like, \"Ooh,\nlike I don't know.\" Like, but yeah, more\nof like a technical skill thing having\nthat at the end. I'm glad I left this on\ncuz like that helped. Like that was game\nchanger. So\n&gt;&gt; give hug. Thank you. And the Waffle\nElite Man in fifth place out of Sandy,\nUtah, riding for Goel Media, let's\nwelcome Joe Gettle.\nmy heart.\n&gt;&gt; What did we get?\n&gt;&gt; All righty, folks. We got fifth in the\nrace and we got fifth in the overall.\nSo, pretty stoked on that. Awesome way\nto end the series off after a really\ntough Arizona and California. I thought\nI was completely out of the running. So\nto land on the box in fifth place, uh\nlike yeah, super happy with that. So\noverall, I think we made some really\ngood strides this year in the series. Um\nwe had some difficulties in the first\ntwo, but you know, the win in Utah was\namazing and then a fifth place here to\nback that up was like pretty sweet, too.\nUh really cool. Closest finish in BWR\nhistory. All top five of us were within\n25 seconds of each other. So that's\nanother really cool thing. Um, you know,\nI knew I would have a hard time keeping\nup with them on the single track and I\nwasn't able to quite do it, but to be\nthat close at the finish is like it's a\ngood step forward. So, yeah, overall\ncouldn't be too much happier with how\nthe whole thing went. Uh, and yeah, just\nthank you guys all for following along\nfor this whole series and watching the\nvideos. We got more races to come, so\nthere'll be a lot more videos and\nlooking forward to next year already.\nUh, trying to keep moving up.\nhurt when they walked out the door.\nHappy they left my heart on the floor.\nHappy I don't have to fight anymore. Had\nto leave it behind me. So real\nstunning out here.\n&gt;&gt; Didn't see you. So how could I know all\nof those tears they were worth it?\nAnd maybe you and me, we deserve this.\nSo happy.",

next 10 days we will be exploring\nplaces we've always wanted to see in our\nhome state of Montana by bike 500 miles\nfrom my house to the Idaho border along\nthe way we will ask each other about our\nfriendship and explore the idea of what\nmakes a good Adventure buddy excellent\nthank you\nI don't know\nhave you guys ever had any conflict in\nthe relationship\nwe had a we had a big disagreement a\ncouple years ago for sure uh over a job\nand uh I think it it changed a lot of\nthings for us we didn't\nwe ended up hanging out for like six\nmonths a year or something like that\nafter that\nHow Far We've gone three miles you got\nthree miles maybe four\nperfect I looked at Andrew I was like\nhow far do you think they're gonna get\nbefore we get a call that they need\nsomething\nlet's wait got it Lifesaver bye fancy\nwe left Isaac's home in Big Fork and\nbegan our journey South the feeling of\nhaving everything we needed for 10 days\nall with us on two wheels was exciting\nit was that unique sort of excitement\nthat comes with not knowing what the\noutcome would be\ngood\nhave you guys ever had a disagreement\ndisagreement\nyeah yeah there's been a few just\nstarted I think there was the major one\nwhich is some miscommunications our\naverage speed is 9.7 miles per hour and\nwe've climbed the Dismal 4120 feet\nthere's a bailout there and then\nthere'll be a probably a bailout here\nit's probable I like that word\nI think we stopped being friends but we\ndefinitely do some time off you know\nit's like I went to France for a few\nmonths maybe four or five months you\nguys didn't hear from Isaac we just\ndidn't didn't talk for a while just like\nit was a weird period yeah\nlast night uh we rolled into Camp what\nwas it like 9 30.\n9 30 road 56 miles we saw a wolf a wolf\nthat might have been injured or playing\nI couldn't tell but you saw a wolf\njust had you give each other some space\nMaybe I know I needed some space there\nwere uh some things that I needed I\nthink to see Alex change a little bit in\nand maybe some things that I needed to\naccept we lost a shoe I think uh my\nmorning\ntechnique\nclassic day two move you know we're on a\nsingle track portion below uh an area\ncalled Elk Creek in the Swan Valley day\ntwo\nso hot and no wind\nso we're uh in our wrestling youth\nuniforms again\nthere's so much to love about traveling\nby bike I think you travel slow enough\nthat you get to experience everything\nfully and fast enough that you can still\ncover a large distance with reasonable\neffort\nthat's how relationships grow right you\nknow\nchallenge\nI think it's a bit stagnant\n[Applause]\nfirst stop where we saw\noh yeah that candy like Generations have\nbeen eating this\nwe talked we both apologized I I think\nthat um\nyeah there were some things that needed\nto be said and it made our relationship\nstronger so yeah we became friends again\nhey straw\nwhere are we at\nthat's what this one top of our climb\nI think time helped you know you choose\nyour friend right so there's something\nhere and we should probably dig into\nright we had so many Epic Adventures\nbefore that that led me to believe you\nhave a lot more after that so that's\nlike a second phase a much more\nconnected phase\nwe were almost to Seeley Lake and then\nuh\nbig big blowout on my bike always my\nbike big flat\nlook at that\nforeign\nLake definitely\nokay let's go\nwhat do you think good enough for a bath\nlooks a bit slim it's got the marsh\nvibes\nI love it when people are excited I feed\noff of people's excitement that way and\nall I had to do was just take Alex on an\nadventure and see his Stoke and his like\nrequests to do more and is like hey\nwhere'd you find out where this place\nwas or Alex is very good at questions\nalways you kept asking questions and I\nkept saying yeah let's do it let's do it\nlet's do it and then yeah that's that's\nhow it went\nI think Alex is a great adventure\npartner because he's almost always\noptimistic even when it's horrible like\nI've rarely seen him lose it in a bad\nsituation we've been in a few\nI know\nIsaac's got some of these skills that I\ndon't have and I admire a lot of them\nIsaac and built things\nas you can find places and Isaac can\nbring excitement all the time and these\nskills I think are really valuable it\nmakes a good combo for an adventure\nbetween\ndegree goal I think with Alex always on\nadventures to have fun and that's always\nmy goals too so it meshes well with me\nhey he made it that was that was the\nsketches Bridge I've ever done the Isaac\nand I have had our moments of failure in\nour friendship but that's what any good\nAdventure is all about going through\nhardships prevailing and coming out\nstronger at the end of it\nI think we both appreciate each other\nmore now\nit's special to have a friendship where\nyou can Bond over seeking objectives and\nbeing uncomfortable the best moments\nwill always take trust and collaboration\nand I think it's rare that we have that\nLiza called and got us somehow magically\nunite at this wonderful little cabin\nthat was reserved on the internet but he\ncalled and he wasn't\nso we got a permit Road out of town got\nto the cabin after a 25 mile ride and\nstarted fire that's pretty much it\nwas really pretty\nfrom this cabin on Twin Lakes we headed\nout into our last day of biking before\nwe reach out the border of Idaho at the\nNFL trip well we found private property\non our route\nstuck here now kind of backtrack\nMinnie Mouse to get to the highway\nthat's right there classic\ntrips like this are often goal oriented\nand it felt weird coming home at the end\nof our ride because this one wasn't we\nset out to try something new discover\nnew areas of our home and a little bit\nmore about our friendship and I think\nthat's what we did\nhey\nthere it is\nnow we're in Idaho now we're in Idaho\noh yeah there it is\nBring It come on oh thanks dude thank\nyou good times yeah\n500 Miles something like that who knows\nI'll have to check who knows who cares a\nlong way many memories\nwhew\nit feels weird it does it's done\ndid you guys ever make it to Idaho\nI think we did maybe sort of we saw the\nwe never saw the Idaho sign but one side\nwas Montana and the other side was yeah\nI know who we supposed I think it wasn't\nimportant\nit really didn't matter how long we rode\nor even if we made it exactly to Idaho\nit was a journey not only to ReDiscover\nour home but our friendship and I'm\npretty thankful for

          "description": "Impossible Route ep.3, Glacier to Tetons is a Cycling Documentary that covers a 5 day adventure across the state of Montana. In this episode we bring along the very fast and very capable pro cyclist, Eddie Anderson. \n\nEddie is an active pro for the team Alpicen Fenix, an Eagle Scout, and a genuine great human. Eddie brings world tour fitness to give context on just how hard the Impossible routes really are. \n\nJeremiah Bishop, Eddie Anderson, and The Vegan Cyclist embark on a 5 day journey across the unridden dirt roads and trails of Montana. Starting in glacier national park, the 3 ride Canyon gravel bikes packed down with everything they need to survive the trip. \n\nMost of the routes were not accessible by vehicle, so the riders needed to be ready for getting out of sticky situations. This cycling documentary is narrated and edited by Tyler (The Vegan Cyclist) but so much work into this project by so many people. \n\nTravis, who was a rider in ep.2 helped a ton with logistics and filming during the trip. Preston got great still photos, and Josh was a wizard with the main videography. A huge THANK YOU to the team behind this and we hope you enjoy this story. \n————\nFAQS:\n:Q: What bikes where ridden? \n:A: JB & VC rode the Canyon Grizzle and Eddie rode the Canyon Grail\n\n:Q: What size tires were ran?\n:A: The crew ran IRC Double Cross 44s \n\n:Q: What was the sleep set up like?\n:A: To save on weight, the riders carried as little as possible. VC had a hammock and a light sleeping bag. JB had a sleep pad and a light sleeping bag. And Eddie bright a full on tent and sub zero sleeping bag. \n\n:Q: What did you eat on the rides? \n:A: Outside of Flow Formulas in our bottles, the riders had to stick up at the random stores along the route. Each day only had 1 stop for fueling, so high calorie foods were the ticket. JB did have a jet boil so heating up water for freeze dried food was great as well. \n\n:Q: How “REAL” is this? How much do you FAKE the drama? \n:A: We don’t fake anything, we ride the ride and let the story play out as it happens. This route had the riders by themselves for most of the day so the safety net of a film crew is rare. \n————\nDONATE : Look, these are tough to make.

have\nundertaken\nso we're going to break it into five\ndays day one 155 miles day two 105 miles\non day three 145 miles day four 155\nmiles and day 5 130 miles\nnow what are the rules\nthere are none this route is so\ndifficult and so hard that we just need\nto survive most of this is extremely\nremote\nareas that can't be accessed by vehicles\na lot of it is single trail so even\nthough we can access the help of our\nfilm crew given that we ever do see them\nmost of the time we are going to be by\nourselves and we have to be\nself-contained\nthat means our bike setup needs to be\ndialed so basically we're going to need\nour sleep gear we're going to need our\nfood we're going to need repair tools\nand most importantly bear spray because\nthis is literally no joke new details\nare emerging about a horrific bear\nattack that killed a northern california\nwoman happened while that woman was\ncamping in the remote town of avondo in\nmontana authorities say a bear pulled\nher out of her tent while she was\nsleeping it's left the community on edge\nso the riders for this one obviously we\nhave jeremiah bishop two-time national\nmountain bike champion co-founder of

his way\naround the forest\nand then there's me your narrator my\nname is tyler and i'm your average joe\ncyclist but that's my goal here is to\ntell you the story of an average guy\ndoing above average things with above\naverage people\nnow after impossible route 2 which might\nhave been the greatest thing i've ever\nachieved in my life i had a really busy\nyear\nso i did gravel locos i did a bunch of\ncrits i raced unbounded raced across the\nwest i did a bunch of family things like\ndisneyland we premiered episode two we\ndid bwr and after all of that\ni was physically and mentally destroyed\nwhen we got to montana all i could do\nwas sleep i could not get off the couch\neven up to roughly the day before i\ndidn't know if i was going to be able to\nstart\ntyler\nis not looking good\nuh he's just been sleeping all day for\nthe last couple days i got him some food\nhe's not eating anything\nwhat i'm saying is uh we're gonna have\nto make a call very soon\nso day one we\nwoke up at three am\nfound out quickly tyler is\ndefinitely not a morning person we're\ntrying to figure out\nwhat do we do i mean the show must go on\ni mean do we ride without him does he\nstart well there's no way he's going to\nbe able to start this i mean he was on\nthe couch on the bed all day eyes closed\ntotally sleeping and yeah we decided to\nroll i i convinced him to just start\ni mean he\nreally really really surprised me\nthinking that there was no way he was\ngoing to get up in the morning\nhe really persevered took every minute\nat a time\nand maybe his energy level will come\nback up and he'll come back online so we\nset off it was a little\ntouch and go\n[Laughter]\noh\ni've learned a lot about my body and\nmyself and my mind throughout these\nimpossible routes and one of those big\ntakeaways is that when you feel like\nthere's no way you're going to start\nthere's no way you're going to finish\nthat you're completely out of your\nleague that you're so stupid for even\ntrying this\nif you just\npedal if you just move forward there\nwill be a light at the end of the tunnel\nand in this case the light at the end of\nthe tunnel is freaking gorgeous\nthey say luck is when preparation and\nhard work and opportunity all meet at\nthe same point\nand even though i feel like an absolute\nsack of moldy potatoes\ni am the luckiest man on the planet it's\nextremely rare to have events come in\nyour life where you know\nthis\nis it\nthis is a legacy moment this is greater\nthan myself and at least for me this\nimpossible route series is that\nand maybe this seems over dramatic but\nwhat i told myself in this moment is\nthese next five days this time right now\nthis will define you as a person\nand when i put it like that to myself\nquitting\nwas never even going to be an option\nif i could just tell my legs to shut up\nand i can have the time of my life and i\ncan define me myself my character well\nthat's an easy decision\nso shut up legs\nlet's ride\nit's really hard\nto put into words\nwhat this place is like\nand i would say it's\nvirtually unlike anything i've ever seen\nbefore\nit is\nperfect\nthat is the word\nthis place\nis perfect\ni've never been anywhere like this the\nphotos online don't do it justice\nmy jaw is dropped and it's still\ndropping\nso\ncan't wait\n[Applause]\nseeing the sun come up over glacier that\ntime of day is\none of the most\nbeautiful sights i've ever witnessed\ndefinitely the most beautiful place i've\never been in the united states i mean\ni didn't know anything like that existed\nhere\nand we made our way\nsouth on the tour divide route ran into\nsome bike packers that was really\nreally cool because we got to talk to\nthem about their mission their trip sort\nof their impossible route\nand these two gentlemen are going from\ncanada to mexico and their timeline is\naround six weeks and this really kind of\ncompared\nto us in a neat way which we are doing\nlight packing they're doing proper bike\npacking they have everything they could\npossibly need on them but the distance\nthey're traveling per day is anywhere\nbetween 30 miles and 80 miles as of what\nwe're doing 130 to 170 miles a day so\nwhen you compare their setup to our\nsetup you can really see that we are the\nbare bones minimum we're trying to be as\nlight and efficient as possible because\nof the mileage and the distance we have\nto cover the first day the mileage\ndefinitely set the expectation um for\nthe following days but i had studied the\nprofile pretty closely and i knew that\nthe last two were really going to be the\nreal tests of the ride\nday one was pretty uneventful it was\nlong we're closing on 10 hours but the\nfirst 30 to 40 miles of this ride was\nsomething i'll never forget so we're\nkind of just trucking through the forest\nand the wilderness we started hitting\nsome beautiful single trail\nwe filtered some water down in the creek\nthe spirits were pretty high as we\nclosed in on our campsite but one thing\nis that we're in the middle of nowhere\nand we have no proper dinner we have\nsnacks that we brought on our bike\nbut we were kind of wondering what this\nwas going to be like after such a big\nday\nto just really have not a whole lot to\neat\nmade it\nmade it that was that was like every\nminute was the hardest minute of my life\nyour hair is like gray now because all\nthe dirt oh cool that's so funny it's\nactually i'm super old\nwelcome to the impossible route 10 hours\nis the minimum\nuh and so we're in the middle of nowhere\nat a campsite there's really no food our\nboy bijou he's the most amazing human on\nthe planet\nuh he couldn't be here with us and he\nsent us a gift box and so this is\nunexpected\nand this is our dinner okay let's start\nwith the note uh dear jb tyler and\nedward\nhope\nyou men are keeping it together i am not\nand having a blast as you laugh and sing\nacross the great and gorgeous state of\nwe did do some singing i hear that some\ndays you're only doing 165 miles that's\npractically a rest day\nthat's true uh well i can't be there and\nyou are handling all your own food\nbetween riding sleeping and life finding\nnutritious and delicious food can get a\nbit tricky so my good friend soraya\nzarya\nbackpackers pantry and i got together\npulled a few of their favorite most\ndelicious vegan meals\nalong with a few surprises just for you\nso we've got these freeze-dried\npad thai\ncoconut rice and black beans what yes\ni mean the dinner our dinner was going\nto be like old bread and some gels this\nis bijou\ni love you man\ntyler slept in a hammock last night and\ni have never seen someone\nshiver as much as he did turns out you\nneed some insulation underneath you too\nyeah it doesn't quite work that way but\ni think\nsome oatmeal and some coffee and\nyeah just start pedaling\nlike it's not gonna be\nfun but you just get rolling and then\nyou start feeling a little better a\nlittle bit better the sun hits you\nyou kind of forget that you slept for\nlike two hours\nday two was really um gonna be soul\ncrusher\nand immediately like greeted by a big\nclimb and just beautiful views the whole\nway\na bit of a\nrough first night of sleep last night\nbut\nyou know\nwe had a good dinner and\nit was a slow morning but now the body's\nmoving\nfeels good to get going first big climb\nof the day\nand we're just traversing this amazing\ncontour along the mountain\nthrough this valley\noh it's awesome\nso we're all running off of virtually no\nsleep it got extremely cold the night\nbefore jeremiah actually woke up in the\nmiddle of night and tried to get inside\neddie's sleeping bag that's how cold it\nwas\nnow day one was probably the most\nbeautiful scenery i've ever seen in my\nentire life but it's very touristy and\nso for me personally i really enjoy\nthese backwoods days where you're on\nsingle trail and you're finding views\nthat maybe aren't as good as glacier\nnational park but you earned them you\ncan't just drive to them there's no\nparking lot there's no gift shop i mean\nwe are earning every view we are seen\nnope\nnope we are we are walking the dirt is\nuh like silt it's there's like a top\nlayer\nof powder\nit's real slippery\nafter we crested the climb\nthere was just this amazing flowing\nsingle track descent like\none of the most beautiful\nflowing fun fast single trek downhills\ni've ever ridden and i was on a gravel\nbike no need to pout i'm an eagle scout\nacross one small little village but they\nhappen to have\nacai bowls and they had coffee espresso\nand we're like well we're not gonna see\nanything for the next six hours so we\nstopped had a little snack there\nwe're doing phenomenal but we're about\nto be way better\nbasically he just saw his life force go\nup like ding ding ding\nthe acai bowl it was phenomenal they had\nthese trucks all over montana so i was\ngrateful to see one you know that gave\nus a ton of energy and then we started\nriding these backwood\nlogging roads\njust\nunbelievable it's whatever views or\npictures i can show just don't do it any\njustice now the road started to go from\npretty good gravel to then just slowly\nkind of went away to the point where we\nwere basically just riding\nthrough the forest\nhow's this road yes wild not much of a\nroad but it is awesome\nthese logging roads were almost like a\nprivate tour of montana just for us\nit was phenomenal the\nspirits the energy was through the roof\nand then once we finished climbing up\nthis we were treated to just a bonsai\ndescent and i'm with two pro mountain\nbikers essentially one two time national\nchampion and eddie is no slouch on a\nmountain bike so i'm doing everything i\ncan to stay with these guys\nthink we would never fail\nwe would never\ndie forget myself again so that\neverything can happen\nby my name\nbut then we hit sheet mountain and let\nme tell you what it was brutal brook's\npoint of the day was definitely sheep\nmountain it came in the last\n30 miles and on paper you're like oh 30\nmiles to go that can't be so bad\nwell\nwhen jeremiah bishop is the\nthe person routing uh your course it it\ncan be pretty bad\nwhen i say this was difficult\nthat is a wild understatement i mean\nthis trail this this climb was only like\na mile and a half it wasn't that big of\na deal but we're 10 hours into the ride\nwe're all out of food we're all out of\nwater you know roughly there's\nonly a couple miles to the finish but it\ntook us forever to get over this pass\nman\nnow we are fully in the\nsheep mountain hika bike\nyou know we we had our bikes on our\nshoulders and just hiking up this single\ntrack trail for like\na mile and a half two miles and this two\nmiles took over an hour you know just\nsome points were rideable\nand i'm not going to say any of it was\nreally unrideable\nas tired as we were there was no way we\nwere going to make some of these\nrock moves on especially on our gravel\nbikes\nyou would want an enduro mountain bike\nfor these types of trails\nso we torqued and climbed and pushed and\neventually got our way to the top of\nthis thing the descent off the backside\nquite rocky also probably better suited\nto a mountain bike but we linked up\nto some smoother lower trails which are\nphenomenal trails northeast of missoula\noh so good\num and eddie you know is just so good in\nthe single track he's drifting and\nsliding and i'm following through\ni'm following jeremiah we're going like\n30 miles an hour and i see what i\nthought\nwas this really big raccoon or something\nrunning across the trail and up into a\ntree jeremiah slams on the brakes\nand all of a sudden we realize it's a a\nbaby bear and i see this little critter\nrunning across the trail and i'm like\nwhoa whoa whoa bear\nand this little baby bear just runs\nacross the trail you know and and i\nstopped short you know maybe just 10\nfeet away and uh he kind of starts\nclimbing up the tree and i'm kind of in\nawe like wow he's moving i was\nterrified you know i looked to the left\nsaw another cub up in a tree so i've\nbeen off the back of them just a little\nbit so then i roll up and i'm like what\nare you guys looking at and so i'm\nthey're saying it's a bear so i grabbed\nmy phone to try to like film\nuh you can't see it on the gopro but a\ngigantic grizzly mama bear stands up on\nher hind legs and i say all right guys\ntime to go bye\nno don't leave me\neverything went wrong like you're not\nsupposed to get in between the mama and\nthe cubs you're not supposed to threaten\nthe bear and obviously we had threatened\nthe bear by screaming in at 30 miles per\nhour fortunately we were quick with the\nbear spray so that encounter with the\ngrizzly bear definitely had spooked us a\nlittle bit in my area i have a ton of\nexperience with black bears but this was\nmy first time ever seeing an actual\ngrizzly bear i was way too close for\ncomfort i saw her stand up on her hind\nlegs and she was just massive and\ndefinitely i got the vibe of like\nthis this bear wants to kill us so as we\nrode down the rest of the mountain we\nall kind of kept looking back we all\nsort of thought like at any moment this\nbear was gonna take us down but we\nquickly moved on to new problems which\nis that it's getting dark it's getting\nlate\nwe're still out here on the mountain\nwe're all out of water and we have no\ndinner we do have some bike packers\npantry left over but\ni am hanging on by a thread sometimes\nsingle track stinks on a gravel bike not\ntoday this was\nso buff and fast and flowing we're just\nchasing each other and going through\nthese jumps\nnow you can tell here on my face that\ni'm struggling a bit but i don't want to\ngive up on this trip and so at this\nmoment while these two chummy chums are\njust having the grand old you know\nreflection on the day i'm trying to\ncontemplate how it's at all remotely\npossible that i start the next day i'm\njust in my mind thinking there's no i'm\nsmoked and all of a sudden out of\nnowhere comes bijou the greatest parking\nlot chef in the world all of a sudden\nshows up\nand he's there for us to feed us to cook\nus food and and your boys back in the\ngame\nit's been a rough two days\nokay so on possible route 1 we\nwe got the help of the most amazing\nhuman on the planet\nbijou\nand he cooked this breakfast lunch and\ndinner and it was just i mean it made it\nmade all the difference and so\nuh you know we didn't think\nwe were going to have his help really\non the rest of them so what what are you\nuh whipping up\nuh it's been a long\nsweaty day out there so one of my\nfavorite it's basically a warm potato\nsalad so it's like a ton of potatoes\nvinegar salt crunchy things pickles it's\nperfect on a day like this i'm gonna\nmake you a\nvegan bolognese using this stuff\ni can't remember who told me this but\nsomeone after watching one of these\nepisodes said don't forget\nany idiot can suffer and i didn't really\nknow what that person meant at the time\nbut now that i've been reflecting on\nthese trips a lot if you wanted to just\nreally suffer you could go in the middle\nof the snow with no food and no tires\nand have your helmet on backwards\nblindfolded it doesn't really tell any\nsort of story anyone can go out and make\nthings very difficult the goal with the\nimpossible route series is to try to tie\ntogether routes that have never been\ndone before to explore areas to tell a\nstory to inspire adventure the routes\nand timelines that we have are extremely\nambitious hence the name impossible\nroute these are supposed to be\nimpossible and sure we could all eat\npringles and gummy bears and get through\nit\nbut with bijou\nthis trip has just\nturned a whole new leaf\nand i cannot wait to start tomorrow\nall right so uh in death valley this is\nwhat we had every morning i've thought\nabout it every morning since uh it's his\noatmeal is so freaking amazing so\nbijou he's here to fuel us we're gonna\nget it done it's like 140 miles today\nprobably 11 hours of ride time\nwe set out for day three we knew it was\ngonna be a monster but we started out\nclimbing the hills east of missoula\nbeautiful single track sun rays\nglistening in i would say on paper day\nthree is sort of one of the biggest days\njust with elevation gain and distance\nand the heat it was going to take\neverything we had to complete this one\nnow we're well rested because we got to\nsleep in a hotel our bellies are full\nbijou's gotten us going on his famous\noatmeal and if we can make it we\nactually have booked a really nice hotel\nin anaconda but it's extremely far away\nwe've got a lot of riding to do i'd\nprefer not to camp again if we can make\nit to the hotel so we're gonna have to\nput down some power\nso far we've been doing nothing but\nclimbing it's been up\ndown up\ndown\nput some of the most\nmind-blowing dirt roads i've ever seen\noh man it's been a awesome day today\nstarted with like a\ngreat portion of pretty smooth single\ntrack and\nthen on this last climb jeremiah kind of\ncranked up the pace a little bit and it\nwas fun to um\nto sweat a little bit\nand really push the pace so we still\nhave a long ways to go so we can't tire\nourselves out too much i guess\nso a big part of the impossible route\nseries is doing roads that have never\nbeen ridden before or there's very\nlittle information on and technically on\na map yes you can go that way but after\nthis absolute rippon of a descent we hit\nthis area where maybe there was a road\nat some point but it was long gone we\nwere just bushwhacking on bikes like i\ndidn't even know\nthat was possible but we were riding\nthrough fields like bushes there was no\ntrail to be seen maybe it existed 100\nyears ago we were just riding straight\ndown the mountainside\nreally i think embodied what this trip\nis all about getting there getting out\nthere exploring new roads new sites\nand um riding places people have never\nridden before don't trust jeremiah\nbishop\nbecause\nhis ride just goes\nstraight down\nthat thing\nit's a map\nsometimes it'll route you and\nso at this point we are six hours into\nthe day we're only a third of the way\nthrough the distance we've got a massive\nfalse flat a 60 mile false flat uphill\ndrag ahead of us we swing into this\nlittle restaurant jeremiah and eddie\nthey go in and get some delicious\nhomemade molasses cookies it's just like\nkind of making my jaw stink no it's\noverloading i haven't had\nanything quite so tasty\noh yeah several hours\nnow out on these rides finding something\nthat's warm and salty and delicious is\nextremely rare so outside this woman had\nactually offered me her french fries the\nleftover french fries on her plate given\nany other circumstance i would politely\ndecline her french fries but in this\nmoment\nwhere i'm struggling and we're about to\nbe riding for a really long time\ni jumped on those fries super quick\nhuh get in there they're actually really\ngood they're like a lot of potato\nfries not just fried they're like\ntwo days ago two days ago we just came\noff the third monster climb of the day\nwe're halfway through in time for only a\nthird of the way through in distance\nwhich\ndefinitely is a little daunting i guess\nthat means we gotta go\none of these days i truly believe i will\nbe able to tell you the story of how\nimpossibly strong i was and not anyone\ncould touch my wheel that is not now\nthat is not today eight hours into this\nride 29 hours into this trip and i am\nsuffering like i have never suffered\nbefore every single pedal stroke to this\npoint has been in mental everest somehow\ntrying to convince myself to keep going\nto dig deep to stay on to not be weak\nbut in life you have two roads to choose\nthe easy and the hard and say what you\nwill about me\nand my riding and my fitness\nbut i often choose that harder road i\nchoose getting uncomfortable i choose\nexpanding my horizons i choose riding\nwith people who are way out of my league\ni choose the hard things because in the\nend that will make the difference when i\nlook back on my life i will know that i\ntried everything in my power to be as\nsuccessful as i possibly can and often\nfailed but at least i will know i gave\nit everything\nnow we have a good three hours of hard\nriding still left so we stop at this\nlittle river and i decided to completely\nsubmerge myself the river was cold it\nwas frigid but i swear this crystal\nclear montana water washed away all\nfatigue that i had built up so far\nwashed away any doubts washed away any\nnegative thoughts any complaints any\nexcuses\ngone\ni found out on day three that uh there\nare two humans that live inside of tyler\nand one of them is an absolute animal on\na bike\num because he smashed the last 40 miles\nhe completely flipped the switch and we\nrode the last climb super hard and then\nlike did a hard rotation and then\nsprinted into town and anaconda\nfamily\nyes\nit was like we did three rides today it\nfelt like three rides today we did the\nbeginning with travis in a gnarly\nsingle track bushwhacking on a bike\nthen we had this like two and a half\nhour false flat river grade uphill grind\noh it's brutal tyler fell apart like\nhe's really hurting i don't know what\nhappened yeah a different human came on\nthe other side of that road well we got\nin the river and i think\njumping in the river just cooled down\nmaybe\nthis is so good what is in here so you\nguys have this is amazing it's rice with\nthe\nthe vegan stuff we had yesterday so we\nmade the light life the vegan um rice\nbowls\nso except today you've got extra fatty\nbacon in there oh yes because\nlook at you\nwe need to put some fat back on you for\nthe next two and a half days yeah so you\ngot extra delicious bacon rice\nenchilada burrito\nso it's got a lot of flavors in there\nbecause i was able to pick up the pace\nthere in the last third we got to the\nhotel with a lot of time left to enjoy\nbijou's food to sit around this little\nfire to sort of have this camaraderie\nwith the whole crew\nit was really a special moment i was\nfeeling on top of the world everyone was\ngetting a lot of good food and then we\ngot to bed and set out for the hardest\nday of the five\nstarting in the dark today\nbig one\nthe morale is high after day three were\nwell fed were well rested but day four\non paper is probably the biggest and\nhardest day any of us has ever done day\nfour man\ni knew\nfrom the beginning this was going to be\nhands down the hardest day almost 170\nmiles\nwith 16 000 feet of climbing it was\ndefinitely the queen stage of the\nimpossible route i mean i was in a funk\nthere i mean i was kind of dizzy tired\nfoggy brained you know when i am in a\nbad spot i don't tell the other guys\nthat's the difference\ni just manage it i know it's gonna\nhappen i know i'm gonna come back up and\nwe hit some really\nuh incredible single track which was\nprobably the highlight single track of\nthe whole trip it would glide and slide\nand we were whipping and diving and\njumping and turning and you know that\nactually got our morale up\nand after we managed to get off the\nsingle track there\nwe faced\none of the toughest challenges\nred mountain\nwhich is this\nmassive alpe west type dirt climb with\nloose rocks\non paper i didn't really know what to\nexpect\ngoing into the climb quickly it turned\ninto this\njust rough rocky 12\naverage grade for five miles like\njust one of the hardest climbs i've ever\ndone on a gravel bike\n[&nbsp;__&nbsp;]\nfat boys and girls\nthere's a big asshill\nyou know look the camera doesn't show\nany justice\nthere's like really sharp rocks and\nthey're so loosey-goosey on top\nand it's thick it's chunky\nand so\nnot only are we super high up but it's\nsuper steep and then there's just no\ntraction\nand so you're having to just\nabsolutely empty the tank to get up here\ni can't believe we're up here i mean\nthis is\nimagine if there wasn't a forest fire\nwhat you would see up here\nuh i mean this is\nthis is just wild\nnow red mountain was an out and back so\nwe actually had to descend down what we\njust climbed up and i'm telling you this\nroad is so chunky\nso technical and i'm with eddie i'm with\njeremiah these guys are dropping me on\nevery climb so i'm trying to maybe not\nget dropped on a descent i'm trying to\nhang with these guys i'm pushing myself\nreally to the limit i'm fatigued and i\nlost it\ni really tried to regroup myself\nmentally as we made it through\nthese crazy farmlands uh it was\nsuch a contrast to we are riding through\nlike alpine trees and then we are at the\ntop of this bald mountain and now we're\nsort of flying through these ranches we\nare making really good time going\nthrough this ranch though there was a\nlittle bit of water crossings and out\nhere it's all open or like right-of-way\nso you can go through these public lands\nand there's these crazy fences that took\nme a minute to figure out\noh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]\nokay\nthough that makes it easier\nall right\nthere we go\nso after almost decapitating my fingers\ni had gotten the hang of these gates and\nwe're making really good time and eddie\nand jeremiah they're flying but i am\nstarting to fall apart i cannot wait\ntill we can get to the gas station to\nrefuel because i am barely able to hold\nmy eyes open\nhey we need a credit card yeah\neight hours into day four and i am\nreally cracking but i've been here\nbefore i know what my body's gonna do\nand i know that if i can just peel\nmyself off the ground and i can keep on\npedaling and i can keep moving forward i\nwill get better i will finish stronger i\njust have to give myself a chance\nyeah why don't we just do that we'll\njust grab a bungee cord i got a couple\nmore bungees hook it to the back and\njust in front of your handlebars\ni'm warning you though i get about 95 in\nthe open\nstretches be ready\ni'm gay spandex will come ripping right\noff of you\nyou guys take care there you go\nbecause it would have been amazing to\nget towed by a dude in a harley with his\nah it tattoos\nhave been fun\ni've been trying to\nbreak through\ni've been done\nbut my towns have often failed\nand the way\nthe day\ni sailed\nwe\nand then the last 40 miles\num was really the second test of the day\nwe are like\n10 hours into this ride\ni am feeling it\nwe'll be pushing daylight on this one\nyou know we hit this crazy barely\nridable like moose pass you know through\nthe stream crossings in mud and i like\nto think i'm normally pretty cool and\ncomposed on the bike but\nwe were hiking at 35 miles to go up\nthese\nridiculously steep gradients and\nwow i was there were some chinks in my\narmor there i was really losing it a\nlittle bit on the trail so frustrated\nknowing how far we had to go\num and how slow we were moving\nso there was a road here at one point\nuh\nthis route is crazy i mean this is\nlegitimately\nearning its name as an impossible route\nso we've got about 6 000 feet of\nclimbing right now\non something like this on this\non this kind of\nhold on to the hand of self-destruction\nand i'm back to a place that i left a\nlong time ago\njust give me a second\nwhile i smoke this\nwhat do you do\neverything will be better when i'm fine\nuh 14 000 feet of climbing\nwe're at 11 hours a little over 11 hours\nhardest ride i've ever done\nunbelievable the low points that i've\nhad today\nthe amount of like puke and rallies that\ni've had\nis actually\nborderline\nunbelievable\nthat before i jumped in the water i mean\ni couldn't even keep my eyes open i was\nliterally my eyes were closed\nit's insane man\ni cuz i almost didn't even start this\nride\nand look what we're doing\nmy life rips dude\nyou just gotta give it a chance you know\nit seemed to be ticking off the\nelevation ten thousand eleven thousand\nfeet twelve thousand feet\nthirteen thousand feet fourteen thousand\nfeet i mean it was just\nclimb after climb after climb\nwell we finally drop off the mountains i\nmean we could see the valley at which\nthe campsite was but there was this\nreally big river\nand we were supposed to go along the\nsouth or west side of the river and we\nwent down toward the west side of the\nriver it's starting to get dark but\nwe're you know maybe as the crow flies\nonly 20 miles which became 18 miles away\nand we knew there was sort of this crazy\njeep trail you know kind of through\nranch country a lot of the ranches out\nhere are right-of-ways\nwell we uh this one was not a\nright-of-way ranch had a 12-foot fence i\nmean the kind you could keep out\nlike kangaroos or i mean it's just you\nknow\nkeep anything out including us said no\ntrespassing in like five different signs\nour hearts sunk it was that moment where\nyou just look at this impenetrable\nobstacle we looked at the map and\nunfortunately had to backtrack like 15\nmiles north to go across the bridge and\nthen 15 miles south just to get to the\nsame point we were\n30 miles in the dark no food out of\nwater i mean we're six pm i wouldn't\nmind hiking i don't know there's not\nanother way out jeremiah like\nwe'd have to ride all the way back to\nyeah that's a\n20 mile detour\nshall we\nshall we what\nwell i think we have\nat some point\nwe just have to\ndo our best and keep moving\nthat is obviously impossible\ni'm gonna chalk it up to fate or god or\nsomething because there just happened to\nbe a pickup truck driving through\nthe one like this is the middle of\nnowhere ultimately you flag it down and\nit's a super kind couple just out for a\ndrive exploring look we are in a real\nbad spot yeah you are to get back to\nwhere there is a road because this\nlooked like it went through i mean\nacross the bridge\nwe're gonna die in the truck is that\ni'm not gonna leave you out here man\nand yeah they they gave us a ride back\nso i guess the impossible route\nit's impossible\ni'm really gonna miss\nall potentiality\nmost of all the days we never got to\nlive\nthey are so real to me\ni guess we must have full time when we\nmade it through to this side\nof our memories\na little lost here\nit makes existence itself a little hard\nto believe\nso despite\nuh me looking like a total train wreck\nmy recovery score this morning is 84\nthat's fantastic we're way up resting\nheart rate is down\nhrv is up\njust one more day just one more day like\nyou can do anything if it's the last day\nwe're gonna get it done\nat least we're not waking up super early\nit's seven right now right so probably\ngonna roll like eight\nthat's gonna be great i feel like a\ndifferent human being this morning\nlike\ni really don't even know how to describe\nhow i feel right now\nout of body like\ni've never been this exhausted\ni'm definitely very sore muscle in the\nback of my arm is just\ni'm\ndefinitely crushed uh hands are\nare sore but for some reason\ni'm operational like\nand that's remarkable this was supposed\nto be fully self-supported and the route\nwas so difficult that we had to uh he\nhad to bring in the hammer and um and\nbijou has helped us so much\ni mean he sent us a package from\nbackpacker backpackers pantry day one\nthat was like\nsaved us uh but then\ndidn't showed up in person for two days\nin the middle\njust the hard chunky part in the middle\nwhy not you're still gonna do the rest\ni know but your fueling just makes it so\nmuch easier\nlike to go to bed like last night\nwithout you here i'm i'm serious i'm\nhitting like a cliff bar and then\ngetting in after after such a hard\neffort\nyeah how do you even recover from that\nlast night would have been rough and\nsleeping on the ground\nlike there was nothing because you guys\njust ended up in the middle of nowhere\nlast night so yeah so we set off on the\nfinal day 130 miles ahead of us but we\nare 44 hours into this trip in four days\nso we're all shelled we're cracked we're\ntired we're achy but it's the last day\nand so you can pretty much empty the\ntank because once you get done with this\nit's over day five man\ni have never woken up feeling like i\nfelt this morning i thought there was no\nway i was gonna peddle a bicycle no way\ni seriously\nhave no idea how i managed to even like\nget out of bed i've never been so\nexhausted\nbut you know after downing some of uh\nbiju's amazing oatmeal yeah that got me\nrolling for day five\ncause there ain't nobody\ncould even be my friends again\nso yeah we're uh making our we're making\nour way\nnothing like a ice cream\nsnowmelt river\ntake all my weaknesses\nthe vibes were way up on the final day\nbecause we knew we were so close to\nbeing done and also technically this was\nthe easiest route of all five we were\nriding through these just like open\nfarmlands it was beautiful we needed to\nget some water so we stopped off at this\nhouse their kids are outside with a\nsuper soaker and so of course all right\nblast him\nas we rolled through the flatlands at 25\nmiles an hour with only two hours left\nto go in the ride i really started to\nthink about how none of this is\nguaranteed it's not guaranteed that\nwe're gonna get past day one and so when\nyou're this close to the finish you\ncan't help but be filled with complete\nand utter\njoy for life we're gonna make it to the\nfinal climb right to the edge of glacier\nnational park we finished the day on a\nclimb up to grand target resort but we\nhave this 3000 foot climb from the\nvalley floor and i mean this thing turns\nleft and right switch backs climbs up\ninto elevation everyone was riding super\nwell which was crazy because you know\nwe've ridden 50 hours in five days tyler\nwas actually riding better than he had\nridden all week you know he's dancing on\nthe paddles he's looking\nexcited and having fun\nlike what where'd this come from i mean\nthe guy's like dying on his deathbed the\nfirst day and now he's like just\nabsolutely ripping everyone was riding\nstronger than they were at the beginning\nof the day it was all smiles at the\nfinish you know we were totally\nexhausted but knowing how tyler felt at\nthe beginning of the trip\nand that he was able to fight through\nand persevere and and finish the way he\ndid and as strong as he did man i'm just\nso happy to have been a part of that\nah\nwow i feel high on life that was a total\ncrescendo\noh my god\nbest feeling actually this is like the\nmost comfortable bed i've slept on all\nweek\ntyler that was amazing well done i don't\nwhat the heck what in the world i don't\neven know how to describe it but you\nwhat's that saying\nit's not about where you're trying to go\nit's where you are you gotta just like\nembrace the now dude embrace the moment\nyou just have to give yourself a chance\nand jeremiah said this in in episode two\nwhen travis was like i'm done i'm i'm\nout like i just go ahead\nthe jeremiah was like we just have to\ngive him a chance\nand that's kind of what that was ringing\nin my head it's just\njust start\njust start make it one mile\nand then just reassess there\nand no joke i've been doing that for 800\nmiles just like just make it one more\nmile just make it one more mile and it's\nso crazy how close i was to not doing\nthis to not riding to quitting every day\nand then\nyou make it and you just surprise\nyourself and then that resets your whole\nspectrum in life on what you think you\ncan and can't do what is hard and what\njust puts everything in perspective all\nright so this is the third one we've\ndone this year this time we brought on\nthe very fast and very capable eddie\nanderson what was so amazing about him\nis that he brought\num more to this trip than just\nhis persona and and him riding a bike\nhe's an eagle scout and he was helping\nwith navigation he was helping with\nlogistics rerouting i mean\nhe helped our sleep setup i mean the guy\nwas just like an ace\nso thank you man well thank you guys for\nletting me be here and thank you to my\nteam albertson fenix for letting me be\nhere and yeah this is the experience of\na lifetime seriously and i mean that\nfully because this is\none of if not the coolest thing i've\never done go on an adventure like this\nand get in a dark space\nand then to get out of the dark space\nwithout killing each other it's like\nsuch such a bonding thing\nand i think it's like um\nyeah yeah i think we're all closer\nfriends because of this all right guys\nthank you so much for watching uh these\nhave been so much fun to do and during\nthese we always kind of have a quote\nthat sums up the whole trip\nand we were riding a couple days ago and\nour eagle scout out here had uh thrown\nout this one quote that seemed so\nfitting and so beautiful\nsomewhere in ages and ages hence\ntwo roads diverged in a wood and i took\nthe one less traveled by and that has\nmade all the difference little robert\nfrost for you\nwhen the sun's going down\nno stars in the sky\ni'ma head down the road\ncounty lines\nwhere the roll of the smoke\nthey pour beer and wine\nand hearts break on the jew\ncross\nwhere the neon stars shine\nand the whiskey\nthey're hanging on\nstars are\nwell the folks gathered around\nthey all look the same\nthey know my dreams",

          "transcript": "3.\nWelcome back to the Drew Dilman YouTube\nchannel. We are at\nBWR California. The big news with this\nrace this year is that there is a\nmassive course change with the change in\nvenue. We are no longer climbing double\npeak. Woo! Which is good because as you\nmight know historically this race has\nfinished up a massive climb with the\nsteepest pitch being right at the end of\nthe race up a road called Double Peak.\nIt was brutal. But this year that is not\nhow the race ends. Instead there's more\ngravel.\nNow that you know double peak doesn't\nhappen at the end of this race, it\ncompletely changes the dynamic of the\nrace because now you know I don't have\nto save so many matches for the end of\nthe race. You can be a little bit more\nrisky with your efforts earlier in the\nrace. Here goes Floyd Landis on the\nattack.\nJohn Borselman attacks with about one\nmile before the first off-road sector.\nAnd this is a strategy that he's used\nbefore to get a buffer before the\ntechnical parts of the course to give\nhimself a little bit of a head start. I\ninitially go with him, but I reacted a\nlittle too late and a little too soft. I\nwasn't fully committed to jumping across\nto his attack. So, I drift back and I\nend up back in the group. And in\nhindsight, I wish that I had committed a\nlittle bit more because I think it would\nhave saved me energy in the long run\ninstead of trying to play catchup after\nnot getting a great position into that\nfirst off-road sector. And it could have\nactually worked to my advantage cuz had\nI entered the dirt sector with\nBoristolman and then dropped Borstman,\nhe'd pretty much clog up the trail for\nme, helping me to open up a gap and at\nleast not have to surge so hard and a\nlittle and go a little bit more my own\npace during that first off-road sector.\nOh, but instead I don't enter that first\noff-road sector with that good of\nposition and end up having to chase to\ncatch back up to the leaders for over 20\n[Music]\nminutes. Floyd Landis is caught.\nThe course this year also included quite\na bit more rough off-road sections,\nwhich meant more people considered it a\ngravel race instead of a road race with\noff-road sectors, which is usually how\nit's been treated in years past. The\nmost obvious display of this was in tire\nchoice. In years past, most riders opted\nfor a wider road tire like the Strata\nBianca 36s I ran last year. However,\nthis year, most riders were on 40s or\n45s and opted for a more gravel specific\ntire. This year I went with the\nPathfinder\n40s. And right on Q, John Borslamman is\non the side of the trail with either a\ncrash or mechanical or flat or\nsomething. He he ends up dnfing, but\nthis is becoming a recurring theme in\nall of my videos. And John, if you're\nwatching this, I know some really good\nmountain bike specific coaches at\nIgnition Coach Co. that could help you\nimprove your handling skills. And heck,\nI'll even give you $100 off your first\nmonth. And with the double dizzle\nkibbits, number 20, don't ignore your\nweaknesses. And number 11, hire an\nignition\ncoach. And sure enough, there's a gap to\nthe front group. And I've done this race\nenough and I've missed the front group\nenough in this race that I am not\ncontent to just sit here and watch them\nright away. So I light it up on this\nsteep uphill section right before a\nreally big downhill in hopes of bridging\nup to those leaders before the next\npaved section.\nOh. Oh.\nI link up with a few other riders and we\nare dedicated to the chase. Now this\ntakes about 26 minutes with a normalized\npower of 335 watts or.92 intensity\nfactor and an average heart rate of 185.\nThis was not an easy bridge, but we are\nsuccessful and we catch those leaders\nright as we're entering in the next dirt\nsector, Lemon Twistenberg. And like a\ndoofus, I go into that section in dead\nlast.\nOh.\nIn this really long dirt section, this\nlead group gets blown to shreds And I\nfind myself chasing with Russell Finster\nWald with about six or seven riders up\nthe road. And we do end up making the\ncatch before the next paved section.\n[Applause]\nAnd for a few moments there, it was\npretty cool to be riding in this front\ngroup, having looked around and seen\nFour previous winners, Matt Beers, Alexi\nVermuan, Russell Finsterwald, and Pete\nStaten. But soon after we catch this\nlead group, we hit the biggest climb on\ncourse, which is a fivemile paved climb.\nAnd basically at the bottom of that\nclimb, I end up gapped off of the\nleaders, but I keep them just in sight\nfor the first half of the climb, but\nthen not being able to bridge that gap,\nend up deciding to go my own pace,\ntrying to avoid a full detonation.\nFamily\npodcast, man.\nAnd to give you an idea of how hard this\nclimb was, it took about 22 minutes with\na normalized power of 347 watts, which\nis 96 intensity factor given my FTP. My\naverage heart rate is 188 and it tops\nout at 196. This is the highest heart\nrate I've seen in a long time. Diesel\nkibbit number 19. Pacing is dead.\nDaxton and Finy end up catching me and\nwe end up working quite well together\nfor the next long while.\nAbout halfway through the race, we end\nup catching the best looking guy in\ngravel, Lance Hayd. When I ask him how\nhe's doing, he gives me a haggarded look\nand says, \"Dude, I'm dying.\" But then he\nproceeds to smash the next climb and I\nfind myself dangling on the back of this\ngroup, barely hanging on, hoping that I\ncan stay with this group of four and\nsolidify a top 10.\nAnd all I can think when I'm in this\ngroup with Lance Hayden, Russell\nFinsterwald, and Dax Mock is that there\nis absolutely no way that their heart\nrate is as high as mine or that their\neffort level is as high as mine. And\nthis is just the reality of racing with\npeople who are more talented than you\nare. You're going to have to put out a\nbigger effort to go the same speed. And\nI feel confident saying that because\nLance, Daxton, and Russell all have big\nresults to back up their race history,\nwhereas I just have a long list of\nmediocre\nresults. With only five guys up the\nroad, it seemed it might be possible\nthat we could be racing for a top five\npodium position if one or two of those\nriders from the lead group completely\nblew up and we caught them. But those\nhopes are diminished when a big group of\n10 riders end up catching us on the next\npave section with the likes of Petervak,\nJulian Gier, and Griffin Easter. Now, me\nand Julian were actually sharing a\nbedroom at our host house. And so, the\nbattle for bedroom bragging rights is\nnow fully on.\nDaxton Mock, who during this race told\nme that he was a handling wizard, nearly\nslides out on this paved descent. It was\nkind of scary.\nWe turn onto this dirt road and about a\nmile after that, we're going to enter\ninto a narrow single track section. Now,\nit is crucial for me to be at the front\nof the group going into that trail\nsection because with a group this big,\nthis late in the race, gaps are\ncertainly going to open. And if I want\nto finish near the front of this group,\nI have to position well because we are\nstill racing for sixth\nplace.\nHeat. Heat.\nI'm about midpack and my three\ncompatriots who I had spent most of the\nrace with, Daxton, Lance, and Russell\nare the top three riders and I was\nwishing that I was up there with them,\nbut I do manage to stay with the leaders\nthrough this trail section. However, I\nam starting to feel quite fatigued and\nthe pain is starting to settle in.\nAnd it's not long after that that I end\nup gapped off the back of this group.\nFizzle kibbits number six. Eat more\ncarbs.\nAt this point in the race, I was a\nlittle bit behind my nutrition plan or\nthe carb intake that I had set out for\nmyself. And I knew that this had\nsomething to do with the reason I was\nhitting the wall. It also doesn't help\nthat I had spent the first 3 hours of\nthis race, well over my pacing strategy\nfor a race this long with heart rates in\nthe 180s and 190s, way more than I would\nhave liked. Here's a chart to give you a\nvisual of my power and heart rate\nthroughout each hour of this race. The\nblue bars are showing you my intensity\nfactor with the power above that. And\nthen the red bars are showing you my\naverage heart rate per hour. The main\nthing that I want to point out is how\nhard I went early in this race. From the\ntime we hit the first dirt section until\nwe were caught by that big group of 10\nriders, I was riding well over the pace\nthat I should have been with a\nnormalized power of 317\nor87 intensity factor for nearly 3\nhours. My average heart rate during this\ntime was 182 with a max of 196. It's\nsafe to say I had burnt some matches.\nAnd I'm not just telling you all this to\nmake excuses. I'm telling you this to\ngive you the facts. And the fact is is I\nneed a little bit more durability and a\nlittle bit more fitness so that I can go\nthis hard early in the race and not be\nriding at such a high intensity factor\nand burning so much energy in the first\nhalf of the race so that I have some\nenergy left in the tank for the end of\nthe race. Heat.\nHeat. Heat. Heat.\nOne of the new parts of the course\nincluded these really sharp uphill\nswitchbacks. And the only way that you\ncould really ride these switchbacks was\nto stick out your hand, grab the post,\nand whip around that thing full cycle\ncross mode. And there were a lot of\nthem.\nNear the end of the last dirt section,\nonly about 7 mi from the finish, there\nwas an optional route. You could opt to\ngo further, stay on your bike, and ride\nthrough a creek. Or you could opt to\nturn and go up this really steep hill\nthat forced you to dismount your bike\nand run. I opted for the runup, knowing\nthat it was about a minute faster than\nthe creek crossing. And I went full\ncyclacross mode once again, shouldering\nthe bike all the way up the hill. The\nspectators at the top even told me that\nI was the fastest guy they had seen go\nup that runup section all day. So, while\nI may not have won the race, I won the\nrunup. I'll take it. By taking the\nrunup, I actually end up passing this\nBear Devo kid, Luke from Georgia, who\nopted for the creek crossing. So, I pass\nhim. He ends up catching me, tries to\nblow past me. It doesn't work. I get on\nhis wheel and we're pretty much dead set\non soft pedaling all the way to the\nfinish where we're going to sprint it\nout. Diesel kibbitz number four, always\nsprint. This is a race. We're not here\nto hold hands across the line. We're\nhere to get the best place possible. So,\nthis kid knows I'm gonna sprint him and\nI know he's gonna sprint me because we\nlike to race our bikes. The last turn is\npretty sketchy. It's on gravel and it's\npretty high speed. And Luke makes a\nreally fast last second pass going into\nthat turn. And I'm hoping he's going to\nslide out, but he doesn't. And because\nthe sprint to the line is so short,\nthere's no chance I'm coming around him.\nand he beats me. Well played, young pad\none. I finish in a time of 5 hours and\n15 minutes with a normalized power of\n292, which is8 intensity factor. Average\nheart rate\n176, TSS 341, 4,700 kJ burned. All of\nthis is good enough for 13th place\noverall. Next up, I've got a massive\ntraining block to prepare for the\nUnbound 200. # overtrain or bust. That's\nall I got for this video. See you in the\nnext one.",

Riders describe the course as encompassing everything gravel racing should be, featuring significant single track sections that create technical challenges, especially when riders hit them 100 miles into the race while fatigued. The terrain includes challenging unroad sectors that pop up unexpectedly throughout the course. Most competitive riders opt for 45mm tires to handle the varied terrain. The race typically breaks down into small groups throughout the day, with expectations that only three or four riders will remain together heading into the technical single track sections. The event attracts strong competition as riders vie for both individual race wins and overall series standings."
