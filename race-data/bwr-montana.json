        "explanation": "The BWR brand carries serious weight, and Montana's 'hardest BWR course' reputation draws legitimate talent like Keegan Swenson's 4:52:30 course record in 2022. Pete Stetina and Lauren De Crescenzo won the inaugural edition, though the pro field has thinned since—more training camp than marquee showdown. Still, when GCN asks 'Americas hardest gravel race?' about your event, you've earned respect."
      },
      "race_quality": {
        "score": 5,
        "explanation": "Four fully-stocked aid stations with bacon, coke, and pickles at critical 20-mile intervals, plus mechanical and medical support throughout. The 13-hour cutoff gives mortals a fighting chance, while the 6am start beats Montana's notorious afternoon thunderstorms. Even with a brutal 24% DNF rate in 2023, finishers rave about course marking and support—suffering delivered professionally."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 5,
        "explanation": "Hell's Kitchen, The Switchbacks, The Ridge—course features with names that stick because they hurt. You'll climb 9,186 feet through five major ascents, walk 3-4 miles of hike-a-bike, and traverse exposed ridgelines at 7,100 feet where 40mph winds nearly blow you off your bike. The waffle breakfast and 'best post-race party of any gravel event' bookend genuine Big Sky suffering."
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 5,
        "explanation": "350 riders max creates an intimate suffer-fest where everyone knows the course broke them equally. Veterans share hard-won intel like 'bring spare brake pads' and '45c tires minimum unless you like dental work,' while the Montana gravel scene treats this as their home championship. The camping option at Fort Missoula Park builds the tribal campfire vibe you can't manufacture."
      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Fast enough to attract former WorldTour pros for training camps, hard enough to humble weekend warriors into a 24% DNF rate. The 350-rider cap keeps it from being a true depth showcase, but sells out consistently which means people are willing to get destroyed again. More quality than quantity—the kind of field where finishing in the top half actually means something."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "$215 standard entry gets you waffle breakfast, four aid stations with real food, post-ride lunch, and beer—solid package for a premium event. But zero cash prizes and 'gran fondo style' means you're paying for the privilege of suffering, not racing. Compare that to local Montana events at half the price, and the BWR brand tax is real."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Missoula lodging hits $149/night at DoubleTree during race weekend, with budget options starting at $89 if you book early—but 'everything sells out.' Direct flights from major hubs keep travel reasonable, though MSO isn't cheap. The $20 camping option at Fort Missoula helps budget-conscious masochists, but factor in tire replacement after the mud destroys your rubber."
      },
      "length": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "87 miles hits the sweet spot—long enough to break you properly, short enough to finish before Montana's afternoon thunderstorms roll in. The 6am start gives you 13 hours to cover ground that 'never truly flat, always climbing or descending,' while the 45-mile Wafer option accommodates mortals. Distance isn't the weapon here; elevation gain is."
      },
      "technicality": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "BWR's '4/5 Belgian Difficulty' rating earns its stars through loose rock on Hell's Kitchen, babyhead descents on Bitterroot Plunge, and 3-4 miles of mandatory hike-a-bike. The 8% singletrack and 52% gravel mix demands bike handling skills, not just engine. Multiple riders report destroyed derailleurs from mud, while course veterans recommend 40t/10-52t gearing just to survive the gradients."
      },
      "elevation": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "9,186 feet of climbing through five major ascents, topping out at 7,100 feet on The Ridge—serious vertical in anyone's book. Starting at 3,200 feet in Missoula means you earn every foot of that elevation gain, with 'never truly flat' terrain that relentlessly grinds legs down. More climbing than most people do in a month, compressed into one Montana morning."
      },
      "climate": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Late June in Montana brings 90°F+ heat on exposed ridges, 30-minute hailstorms, and wildfire smoke that pushed AQI to 150 in 2023. Morning lows hit 48°F requiring arm warmers, then afternoon thunderstorms threaten lightning strikes on high ridgelines. The 2021 'mud year' created six miles of peanut butter that destroyed drivetrains—Mother Nature doesn't cooperate here."
      },
      "altitude": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Starting at 3,200 feet isn't brutal, but The Ridge maxes at 7,100 feet where sea-level riders feel the thin air bite. One finisher noted 'felt the altitude on The Ridge if you're coming from sea level'—not Leadville suffering, but enough to make hard efforts harder. The elevation gain matters more than absolute altitude, though that final climb will remind coastal riders they're not at home."
      },
      "logistics": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Fort Missoula Regional Park provides free parking and $20 camping, while MSO airport sits 15 minutes from downtown with direct flights from major hubs. Packet pickup Friday 4-8pm at DoubleTree avoids morning chaos, and overflow parking with shuttle service shows planning. The 'bring ID, license, and printed waiver' requirement is straightforward, though booking lodging early is mandatory—everything sells out."
      },
      "adventure": {
        "score": 5,
        "explanation": "GPS dies in canyons, 40mph ridge winds threaten to blow you sideways, and hailstorms turn June into winter hell—real adventure, not Instagram theater. The exposed traverse at 6,800 feet and technical descents through babyheads demand commitment beyond pedaling hard. When riders say 'download offline maps' and 'bring warm clothes for post-race,' you know you're signing up for genuine Big Sky uncertainty."
      }
    },
    "final_verdict": {
      "score": "77 / 100",
      "one_liner": "The Belgian Waffle Ride that actually lives up to its Belgian difficulty rating, where Montana's mountains separate the climbers from the pretenders.",
      "should_you_race": "Show up if you can sustain power at 7,000 feet and don't mind walking your bike through Hell's Kitchen when the grades hit double digits. This isn't about gravel handling—it's about whether your legs can push a big gear up endless climbs while your lungs remember what thin air feels like. Skip it if you think 9,000 feet of elevation sounds fun on paper.",
      "alternatives": "Leadville Trail 100 MTB gives you the same altitude suffering with actual prize money, while Unbound keeps you closer to sea level if you prefer speed over elevation. For pure climbing masochism without the gravel pretense, just ride Mount Washington Hillclimb and save yourself 86 miles of buildup."
