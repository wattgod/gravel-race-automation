        "explanation": "Missoula lodging hits $149/night at DoubleTree during race weekend, with budget options starting at $89 if you book early—but 'everything sells out.' Direct flights from major hubs keep travel reasonable, though MSO isn't cheap. The $20 camping option at Fort Missoula helps budget-conscious masochists, but factor in tire replacement after the mud destroys your rubber. Similar expense level to Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."
