        "explanation": "$215 standard entry includes waffle breakfast, four well-stocked aid stations, and post-ride amenities, but MikeMckinney notes the finish has \"nothing that makes you hang out\" beyond beer and a coozy. No cash prizes for a premium-priced gran fondo style event limits the competitive value proposition."

        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Missoula lodging hits $149/night at DoubleTree during race weekend, with budget options starting at $89 if you book early—but 'everything sells out.' Direct flights from major hubs keep travel reasonable, though MSO isn't cheap. The $20 camping option at Fort Missoula helps budget-conscious masochists, but factor in tire replacement after the mud destroys your rubber."

      "should_you_race": "Show up if you can sustain power at 7,000 feet and don't mind walking your bike through Hell's Kitchen when the grades hit double digits. This isn't about gravel handling—it's about whether your legs can push a big gear up endless climbs while your lungs remember what thin air feels like. Skip it if you think 9,000 feet of elevation sounds fun on paper.",
      "alternatives": "Leadville Trail 100 MTB gives you the same altitude suffering with actual prize money, while Unbound keeps you closer to sea level if you prefer speed over elevation. For pure climbing masochism without the gravel pretense, just ride Mount Washington Hillclimb and save yourself 86 miles of buildup."
