      "race_quality": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Monuments of Cycling delivers world-class production. Professional expo at Kanuga Resort, quality aid stations, well-marked course, and Belgian-themed post-race festivities. Minor deduction for packet pickup chaos issues."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "The combination of challenging 'Unroad' sectors, stunning mountain scenery, and Belgian beer culture creates a memorable race day. You'll remember the suffering and the celebration equally."

      "community": {
        "score": 4,

        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "$195 entry is premium gravel pricing. The organization quality, venue, and overall experience justify the cost, but it's not cheap. You're paying for a well-produced event, not budget gravel."

      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Moderate total costs. Asheville flights are available but not the cheapest. Hotels run $100-200/night. On-site Kanuga Resort is premium but eliminates logistics headaches. Budget $800-1,200 total trip cost."

        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "The Waffle course ranges from 100-137 miles depending on year. Even the shortened 2025 course was 100 miles. Substantial distance in the century-plus category without reaching ultra territory."
      },
      "technicality": {
        "score": 5,
        "explanation": "This is the most technical BWR course. Singletrack sections, 29% grades, rocky descents, creek crossings, and mandatory hike-a-bike sections. MTB skills are essential - pure road fitness won't save you here."
      },
      "elevation": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Brutal Appalachian climbing with 9,000-14,000 ft of gain depending on year. Over 20 categorized climbs with relentless punchy efforts. The steepest sectors hit 29% grade."

      "climate": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "October timing provides near-ideal conditions - 67F highs, moderate humidity, minimal rain risk. The move from June eliminated the brutal heat that plagued earlier editions. Fall foliage is a bonus."

      "altitude": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Blue Ridge Mountains venue sits around 2,500 ft elevation. No significant altitude concerns - sea-level athletes won't notice any performance impact."

      "logistics": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Asheville Regional Airport is just 11 miles/17 minutes from the venue. Charlotte Douglas offers more flight options at 97 miles. Hendersonville has good lodging, and Kanuga Resort on-site is ideal but books fast."

      "adventure": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Stunning Blue Ridge Mountain scenery with peak fall colors, 30-acre lake views, waterfalls, dense Appalachian forests, and a two-state course crossing into South Carolina. Memorable and photogenic throughout."
