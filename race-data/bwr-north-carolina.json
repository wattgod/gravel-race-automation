Adam Roberge praised the event: \"It was so fun, please keep this race. I don't know if I'm biased since I like the East Coast, but this course is just perfection.\" The venue moved from Kanuga Resort to Wag Valley Farm for 2025 due to Hurricane Helene recovery efforts."

Previous editions reached 134 miles with 13,000 feet of climbing through relentless Appalachian terrain.

        "score": 5,
        "explanation": "The course features \"rooty trails and gravel roads\" with surfaces \"considerably more challenging than the typical hard-pack at the California race.\" Race organizers recommend 32mm tires minimum regardless of experience due to technical singletrack sections. Emily Newsome described \"pushing it really hard on the climbs and tried to hang through all the technical stuff\" during her winning effort."

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "The Blue Ridge Mountains venue sits around 2,500 feet elevation with rolling mountain terrain through Appalachian foothills.

The challenge comes from relentless climbing and technical terrain rather than thin air, as confirmed by the varied course profile spanning multiple counties."
