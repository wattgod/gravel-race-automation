Yun reports \"With 1,500 riders rolling out together, we got caught behind bottlenecks on early singletrack—losing nearly 45 minutes before the race even really began.\" The venue itself (Del Mar Polo Fields) provides ample parking, though course management struggles with field size logistics."

Yun finished \"just under 13 hours,\" while others took 14+ hours to complete the course. Nick Leeper targeted \"300 watts\" for Double Peak but \"couldn't push my target power\" after 100+ miles in the saddle. The distance reflects annual route tweaks and the organizers' penchant for secrecy."

        "explanation": "Pete Stetina observed the course evolution: \"this year it was a gravel race with road sectors\" rather than a road race with dirt. Yun noted \"A brief trail section lifted our spirits, as did Keri's expertise in picking the best MTB lines.\" Nick Leeper chose 35c tires at 44 PSI but \"didn't have a lot of cornering and braking confidence with the 35c tires on the loose over hard single track.\""

Nick Leeper \"couldn't push my target power of 300 watts\" on the Double Peak climb, managing only \"270 and getting passed more than I should have.\" The sadistic genius is timing—brutal climbing when legs are destroyed from 110+ miles.

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "San Diego's May weather typically offers near-ideal conditions, but 2025 proved challenging. \"Southern California received a lot of rain this year which rutted out the dirt and made it pretty rough,\" creating technical terrain issues. Yun noted \"'At least the weather's cool,' I kept telling myself\" during grey skies that were \"perfect temps for hard riding without overheating.\""

      "altitude": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Starting at Del Mar Polo Fields near sea level, the course climbs inland toward Palomar Mountain but doesn't reach sustained high altitude. The highest points in Highland Valley Road and Pamo Valley don't approach the 9,000+ ft threshold for significant oxygen impact. Most climbing occurs at moderate elevations throughout Southern California's coastal mountain terrain."

Yun and her partner were \"two of just 21 women to finish the Waffle that day. Only about two-thirds of the 300 men finished.\" The course includes creek crossings, Death Valley sections, and Lusardi Switchbacks. Post-race features Belgian waffles and Lost Abbey beers for survivors."

      "prestige": {
        "score": 5,
        "explanation": "BWR San Diego IS the original. The OG. The granddaddy that spawned an entire series across North America. It's the Queen Leg of the Quad-Tripel Crown and attracts the biggest names in gravel: Peter Stetina, Keegan Swenson, Alexey Vermeulen, Matt Beers. When Michael Marckx created this in 2012, he established a blueprint that the entire gravel world has tried to copy. 15 years of history and counting."

The race includes timing chips, SAG support until cutoff, and full expo experience. Nick Leeper confirms they \"provide a lot of support\" throughout the challenging course."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 5,
        "explanation": "The combination of technical terrain, brutal climbing, and extreme attrition creates unforgettable suffering. Yun described sprinting \"between cutoffs\" with her partner, \"determined to beat the 11:30 a.m. deadline.\" The weather impact made terrain \"pretty rough,\" adding to the challenge. Only finishing earns access to the post-race Belgian celebration culture with actual waffles and craft beer."

      "community": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "BWR has cultivated a passionate tribe of 'kasseien-crushing winnaars' who return year after year. The Belgian classics heritage creates unique shared language and culture. However, the extreme difficulty (30-40% DNF) means this isn't the most welcoming entry point for gravel newbies. The community is tight but demands you earn membership through suffering. As Event History puts it: \"It was 2011 when just 136 people showed up for the first ever Belgian Waffle Ride. What it was was anyone's guess.\""

      "field_depth": {
        "score": 5,
        "explanation": "The field attracts elite gravel professionals and serious competitive riders. AbbottRacing and other elite-level participants compete alongside recreational riders like Julie Dunkle. The extreme difficulty creates natural selection—Yun notes \"Only about two-thirds of the 300 men finished\" in 2025. Power outputs like Nick Leeper's 440W efforts on early climbs demonstrate the competitive caliber required."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "At $195+ for entry, BWR is premium priced but delivers premium value: full weekend festival, expo access, multiple aid stations, SAG support, timing chip, post-race waffles and finisher's beer. The 15-year prestige, quality production, and life-changing experience justify the cost. You're not just buying a race entry - you're buying access to gravel royalty."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Total trip cost is moderate for an elite event. San Diego has abundant accommodation options across price points. Flights to SAN are competitive from most US cities. Del Mar area isn't cheap but Escondido offers budget options. Figure $195 entry + $150-300/night hotel + $200-500 flights + food/misc. You can do BWR for under $1,000 total if you're smart, or splash out on beach resort recovery. Similar expense level to Leadville Trail 100 MTB."

          "description": "Belgian Waffle Ride is always an epic event. BWR has a new location this year which starts in Del Mar and featured a smaller but tight group of favorites from previous winners like Peter Stetina, Alexey Vermeulen and defending champ Matt Beers. This represents a new era in gravel cycling as riders are getting faster on and off the dirt and single track. Notable women include defending champ Sofia Gomez Villafane and Flavia Oliveira. It was an extremely fast race course that had the bicycle pushed to its limit. We always love covering our local bike race BWR. Did you do the event? How was your experience?

Yeah.\nUh today it's as good as it can get as\nfar as the conditions and the bikes and\nthe fun. I'm so happy to see the changes\nthat were made. You know, the series\nkeeps growing which is amazing. They\nhave a couple new races uh that I've\nnever done. So, I'm excited about that.\nThis is a brand new course to me. It's\nlooking pretty exciting. It's going to\nfavor the mountain bikers a little bit\neven though there's a fair amount of\nroad. I think the decisive parts of the\ncourse always lend it to those with more\nexperience in the off-road side of\nthings. But I think we're going to be\nhaving a pretty epic day out there as\nper usual and typical Belgian waffle\nfashion. I'm excited that there are so\nmany strong women lining up for this\nrace as well. I think that just elevates\nthis sport all together.\nWelcome to San Diego, California as we\nget ready and out for the 14th edition\nof Belgian Wubble Ride\nCalifornia. All the stars have arrived\nas we get ready for what's going to be a\ndynamic day of racing. This field is\nstacked. It is stacked for sure. Dave\nCole, what a great job on those\nintroductions. Ladies and gentlemen,\nwith just a few minutes to go, please\nrise if you can. Remove your caps.\n90 seconds, racers. 90 seconds to go\ntime.\nRacers, let's get\nready. We are counting\ndown.\nHeat.

About 20\nseconds. No lance. You look pretty, man.\nNo copes, Drew. I like it. No copes,\nman. You're looking good.\nAbout 40\nseconds. We got\nthis. About 1 minute. One minute behind\nMatt\nBeard. Yan, smooth this fast, man.\nYou're going to close it up on the road.\nLooking good, man. Stay aggressive. Stay\naggressive. Stay up there. You\nabout a minute and a half.\nNice.\nGood, Russell, man. Hang in there.\nSteady, man. Oh, no. Can we do anything\nfor you? It was just a gel. Just a gel.\nRight on, man.\n42. Come on, Drew. It's a long day, man.\nRide for the family, man.

Stay\naggressive.\nDamn, that's a big group.\nThere you go.\nOoh.\nRight,\nboys.\nHeat up\nhere.\nHe's clawing his way back\non. Dad's checking back. Matt look Matt\nlooks the freshest out of the three.\nPete knows what to do. He's latching on,\nnot giving up any daylight.\nPete is out of the saddle. Matt goes\nagain. He's making another dig. He\nresponds. Digging deep in the gap. He's\nchecking his\nsix gapped off by like Oh, this could be\nthe race right here.\nCome on. Come on, Alexi. Come on, Alexi.\nGo. Go now.\nOh, he's sitting\nup toast. He's sitting up for crab a\nlittle bit. Oh, he's super tucking.\nBig gap, though.\nAlexi can descend though. It's world\ntour.\nOkay, hang on. Michelle,\ndon't worry about me. I think you just\nturn\noff. This guy's\nwalking. Go. Got to go.\nGo Matt. Go Matt.\nPete. Come on, Alexi. Pete's right\nthere. Let's go.\nGo, go, go, Pete. Let's\ngo. It's all good. Let's go, Alexi.\nPete's right up there.\nJust force it. Right. You did it.\nYou did it. That does not count. But\ndon't take it.\nMan, you're 220 behind.\n40 seconds to pee.\nBack to back. Beat the new boss. It's\nthe same as the old boss. Here you have\nit.\nChampion South African\nMad.\nWow. Wow.\nYeah, man. Nice job, dude. Nice repeat.\nThat was incredible. Do you have a you\nhave the win to tell us how you attacked\non the downhill to make that happen?\nYeah. Uh, I saw Alex Lexi was looking a\nlittle fragile and um and then Pete was\nkind of giving it and yeah, I decided to\njust I could tell my I'm a big boy so I\ncan use my, you know, 80 kilos plus to\nreally move the momentum down the hill.\nAnd then I I think I corner a little bit\nbetter than those two guys. So I just\nthought, you know, free speed, free\ntime. Yeah, you had about a minute 40\ngap on the descent and then you just\nkept extending it at Hernandez hide h\nhighway when I saw you last. You had 4\nminutes on peak. Oh wow. I could have\ngone easier now. I know. Sorry, I should\nhave told you that. I thought it was 2\nminutes. I was just giving it like 460\nwatts into the head with this whole way.\nOh, you took it easy then. Yeah. Yeah.\nWell, congrats again. It was really\nwonderful to watch the whole day. Thank\nyou.\nComing in now. And here he is, your\nsilver medal winner. Pratty for the\nCliff family. That's Peter Staten.\nCongratulations, Peter. With some riders\nfinishing up,\nwhat do you say to the people at home?\nThey were rooting for you. I feel the\nlove whenever I come here. But, uh, I\nthink we all witnessed something special\ntoday. I mean, I can say I had a great\nday and some of the best legs I've had\nin a long time. And look good. Uh Matt\nBeers was the cat and I was his ball of\nyarn. I mean, I think uh all I can say\nis I'm I'm in awe and I think we've got\na a real champion for the future on our\nhands just because, you know, he was\ndoing a local mountain bike race uh a\nfew days ago and stoking kids out\ninstead of just being at home and\nresting his legs as the normal pro\nthing. So, uh man, I'm a I'm a fan and\nuh second to my true place today, so I'm\nI'm really glad to to end there. Yeah.\nCongrats. You look great out there.\nYeah. Yeah. That man's a beast. And on\nthis technical trail too has just he's\njust put minutes into into me on the\nYeah. You don't have that extra climb at\nthe end on this course. Bring back\ndouble peak for me and then maybe he'll\ncramp. It's all good, guys. Were you\nwaiting for Alexi? you kept at first.\nYeah. So, the split was down Highland\nand uh I Matt took a corner scary fast\nand there was a small gap and when you\nknow 190 lb guy or whatever gets that\ngap it just he was just tucking and I\ncouldn't close it. So, it was actually\nthat was the split of the race. Um and\nyou know initially not racing for second\nI just you know I kind of looked at\nAlexi like if it's just 111 the race is\nover. So, I kind of was like, \"So, get\nto me so we can go.\" But yeah, I thought\nAlexi was playing games at first, but I\nthink he's uh he was a little off. Yeah,\nhe was flashing.\nThe way back is tough.\nWere you trying to bridge to Pete? He\nkept on looking back at you at Highland.\nI mean, and it was like 5 seconds. Yes.\nNo. I mean, like I the whole day I felt\nnot great. um and kind of just trying to\nfake it until we got to a point that the\nrace would happen. And um yeah, I mean I\nI could have come back to him on the\nroad, but it wouldn't change anything,\nright?\nSometimes knowing that's better than\nanything else cuz you still got a lot of\nracing to go. That's true. That's true.\nGas to go with those guys up that climb.\nSo, I mean, I probably could have, but I\ndon't think I would have made it back.\nWell, you you hung tough and allowed to\nperform at the finish. I think it was\ngood to back off on Pomo climb for a\nsecond. Just for a sec. Yeah. I just\ndon't want to get anyone to hit you.\nWater will be right now. I can go get\nyou one.\nI wanted to have legs for the single\ntrack section coming back into town\nbefore coming back into town. Turn\naround where the group essentially blew\napart. Jonas and I fell off the back and\nMatt was at the front and just\nlike 500 watts going up that thing\ntrying to just hold on for dear life. We\ncame over the top probably 30 seconds\noff and then just worked together. We\nknew like there's a pretty big group\nbehind us. Wasn't sure on time, but we\nworked well together uh heading back to\nthe finish and then uh group caught us\nright at the tight switchbacks.\nYep. Caught us right there. Peter was\nleading that group just ripping. I'm\nlike, how is he? He reeled us in by the\ntop by the top of the switchbacks and\nthen us three hit the hikabike section,\nrode most of it, and then jumped off,\nran up it, and then it was just like\nwide open up those last three little\nkicks. Seven for seven large. This is\nnot the queen. This is the emperor, the\ngrand champion, the greatest of all\ntime. You're going to win by 30 minutes.\nThis is your champion, Sophia\nGomez. The living breathing queen of\nI was alone for a long, long time.\nJohn Borman came and like rolled me with\nZach and somebody and Coen and I just\ngot gapped and then I caught on the\nsingle track and then the guy I was\nwith. We did the first climb and then I\nhad to stop to check something and he\ndrops me speed and then I was basically\nsolo up until Ramona on the way back and\nthen yeah had a nice little group of\nchildren. How was it overall?\nIt was good. I mean the time isn't long.\nI like it but\nI'm also\nnot any issues out there.\nYeah, it was fit. Yeah, I won. That's\nall that matters. I think last year\nthe field might have been a little bit\ndeeper and there was girls that had like\nthis year to see Whitney and um Courtney\ncrash out was like super super fun to\nhear. Um so that's just never any fun.\nhave, but it's a savage course and you\ngot to keep your tires on the ground.\nOolivera, second place at BWR. Are you\nhappy with second or disappointed? Oh,\nyou know, it's a mixed bag. You know,\nobviously I'd love to win this race, but\nI know I had tough competition out there\nand getting second to Sophia is, you\nknow, also something to be proud of. The\nrace is pretty hectic from the\nbeginning. Yeah, it was I I just wanted\nto stay safe in that first part. It was\npretty chaotic in the beginning. Also,\nmy knees. It's steep.\nI didn't realize how steep it was going\nto be. Even with a mountain bike shoe,\nthere was no traction.\nToo bad. Nice. Yeah, it was awesome. The\ncourse is great. I love it. It was fun.\nYeah. Windy. Very windy. Were you by\nyourself a lot? Uh, in the beginning a\nlittle bit. I just I was just too scared\nto be fighting for position in that\nfirst part of the not the road, but once\nwe got into the trail, uh it was\nimmediately mayhem. Bodies and bikes\ngoing every each direction. I was like,\nthere were a couple crashes. I'm sure\nyou guys know. Winnie is in in urgent\ncare right now. I hope she is going to\ngo get her. Yeah, this is never\nsomething you want to see. That's what\nI'm saying. So, you got third today at\nPWR. Are you happy with third or a\nlittle disappointed that you didn't get\nbetter? What's going through your mind?\nYeah, great question. A little bit of\nboth. It was my first time ever riding\n100 miles in general. So, I really\ndidn't have any sort of expectation\ngoing into the race. Um, I definitely\nwanted to be closer to Flavia. I really\ndon't know what the gap was there. and\nyou know Sophia is in a league of her\nown but uh it was really just\nexperiential so I'm really not\ndisappointed at all. What was your most\nmemorable part of the course today?\nUm probably the end. So that part was\nextremely extremely tough with the\nzigzags and then going into some\nextremely steep sandy downhills and then\nsome 30% uphills. I did walk my bike at\nthe very end, so it was soul crushing uh\nfinish. So, I think that was my favorite\npart. Nice. Well, congrats on third\nright there. Our top five elite wrestle\nwinner here at the 13th annual VW\nCalifornia. Congratulations. There you\ngo, ladies and gentlemen. your top five\noverall here in the 2025 Waffle Elite\nmen's category at BWR California.\nCongrats.\nOkay, so we are back at the Velworthy\nhouse. Uh our house guest Whitney\ncrashed out and she is out of\ncommission. Zach is here taking care of\nher. We're all taking care of her. But\nthe race is over and man does it feel\ngood to be back out on the course, out\ntalking with the athletes, seeing things\nunfold, giving words of encouragement.\nAnd so I really hope you like this\nvideo. Um, and I'm just can't wait to\nget back in the in the mix of things.\nIt's, you know, hard being uh with\nthings going on in my personal life just\nunraveling to have cycling as something\nthat is sort of my constant, my safety.\nSo, um, hope you like the video. Another\nBWR is in the books. Uh, can't wait for\nthe next event. So until next time, this\nis Brian saying stayworthy.",

Come experience the more attainable versions of the Belgian Waffle Ride from me while doing the BWR Wafer and from my dad while doing the the BWR Wanna. \n\nThis is the perfect race for us to do together as it meets in the middle of our cycling interests and desire to cover miles. I generally prefer all terrain bicycle touring, and my dad generally prefers cross country mountain biking. \n\nOther than that, all you really need to know about the BWR is that instead of medals, finishers receive a celebratory bottle of beer. Oh, and who could forget the pre-race waffles and the post-race waffles with ice cream.\n\nWe're not sponsored, but we both really liked our bicycle setups, which were as follows:\n\nMe: \n- Sonder Camino gravel bike (https://us.alpkit.com/collections/sonder-camino?storeRedirect=US) with the low end Shimano GRX group set (https://bike.shimano.com/en-EU/product/component/grx-10-speed.html)\n-  Teravail Washburn 700 x 38 gravel-specific tires (https://teravail.com/products/washburn-tire?variant=39350969499699)\n- Road Runner Bags Jammer Handlebar Bag (https://roadrunnerbags.us/products/the-jammer-bag)\n\nMy dad:\n- Specialized Diverge Comp gravel bike (https://www.specialized.com/us/en/diverge-comp-e5/p/199975?color=322132-199975)\n- Specialized Pathfinder Pro 700 x 38 gravel-specific tires (https://www.specialized.com/us/en/pathfinder-pro-2bliss-ready/p/157870?color=237517-157870&searchText=00019-4412&gclid=Cj0KCQjw-JyUBhCuARIsANUqQ_LyEl2VbNqdxwA5W_cBCQW2IIaaFJPUiSkaK055wDXOtzW3_Opw1AgaAr5PEALw_wcB)\n- Road Runner Bags California Burrito Handlebar Bag (https://roadrunnerbags.us/products/california-burrito-handlebar-bag)\n\nThis video was filmed on a GoPro Hero 10 (https://gopro.com/en/us/shop/cameras/hero10-black/CHDHX-101-master.html?gclid=Cj0KCQjw-JyUBhCuARIsANUqQ_LMvl54Yh0oDH98xJAuVxjrNKZdQ2vAM8Wgi-6KjeXXuxoCRK7Wk1waAsXvEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds&option-id=CHDHX-101-master) and my dad's cell phone (I think a Moto G8 or something)\n\nAll music and sound effects are from Epidemic Sound, which has an amazing selection.

          "transcript": "3.\nWelcome back to the Drew Dilman YouTube\nchannel. We are at\nBWR California. The big news with this\nrace this year is that there is a\nmassive course change with the change in\nvenue. We are no longer climbing double\npeak. Woo! Which is good because as you\nmight know historically this race has\nfinished up a massive climb with the\nsteepest pitch being right at the end of\nthe race up a road called Double Peak.\nIt was brutal. But this year that is not\nhow the race ends. Instead there's more\ngravel.\nNow that you know double peak doesn't\nhappen at the end of this race, it\ncompletely changes the dynamic of the\nrace because now you know I don't have\nto save so many matches for the end of\nthe race. You can be a little bit more\nrisky with your efforts earlier in the\nrace. Here goes Floyd Landis on the\nattack.\nJohn Borselman attacks with about one\nmile before the first off-road sector.\nAnd this is a strategy that he's used\nbefore to get a buffer before the\ntechnical parts of the course to give\nhimself a little bit of a head start. I\ninitially go with him, but I reacted a\nlittle too late and a little too soft. I\nwasn't fully committed to jumping across\nto his attack. So, I drift back and I\nend up back in the group. And in\nhindsight, I wish that I had committed a\nlittle bit more because I think it would\nhave saved me energy in the long run\ninstead of trying to play catchup after\nnot getting a great position into that\nfirst off-road sector. And it could have\nactually worked to my advantage cuz had\nI entered the dirt sector with\nBoristolman and then dropped Borstman,\nhe'd pretty much clog up the trail for\nme, helping me to open up a gap and at\nleast not have to surge so hard and a\nlittle and go a little bit more my own\npace during that first off-road sector.\nOh, but instead I don't enter that first\noff-road sector with that good of\nposition and end up having to chase to\ncatch back up to the leaders for over 20\n[Music]\nminutes. Floyd Landis is caught.\nThe course this year also included quite\na bit more rough off-road sections,\nwhich meant more people considered it a\ngravel race instead of a road race with\noff-road sectors, which is usually how\nit's been treated in years past. The\nmost obvious display of this was in tire\nchoice. In years past, most riders opted\nfor a wider road tire like the Strata\nBianca 36s I ran last year. However,\nthis year, most riders were on 40s or\n45s and opted for a more gravel specific\ntire. This year I went with the\nPathfinder\n40s. And right on Q, John Borslamman is\non the side of the trail with either a\ncrash or mechanical or flat or\nsomething. He he ends up dnfing, but\nthis is becoming a recurring theme in\nall of my videos. And John, if you're\nwatching this, I know some really good\nmountain bike specific coaches at\nIgnition Coach Co. that could help you\nimprove your handling skills. And heck,\nI'll even give you $100 off your first\nmonth. And with the double dizzle\nkibbits, number 20, don't ignore your\nweaknesses. And number 11, hire an\nignition\ncoach. And sure enough, there's a gap to\nthe front group. And I've done this race\nenough and I've missed the front group\nenough in this race that I am not\ncontent to just sit here and watch them\nright away. So I light it up on this\nsteep uphill section right before a\nreally big downhill in hopes of bridging\nup to those leaders before the next\npaved section.\nOh. Oh.\nI link up with a few other riders and we\nare dedicated to the chase. Now this\ntakes about 26 minutes with a normalized\npower of 335 watts or.92 intensity\nfactor and an average heart rate of 185.\nThis was not an easy bridge, but we are\nsuccessful and we catch those leaders\nright as we're entering in the next dirt\nsector, Lemon Twistenberg. And like a\ndoofus, I go into that section in dead\nlast.\nOh.\nIn this really long dirt section, this\nlead group gets blown to shreds And I\nfind myself chasing with Russell Finster\nWald with about six or seven riders up\nthe road. And we do end up making the\ncatch before the next paved section.\n[Applause]\nAnd for a few moments there, it was\npretty cool to be riding in this front\ngroup, having looked around and seen\nFour previous winners, Matt Beers, Alexi\nVermuan, Russell Finsterwald, and Pete\nStaten. But soon after we catch this\nlead group, we hit the biggest climb on\ncourse, which is a fivemile paved climb.\nAnd basically at the bottom of that\nclimb, I end up gapped off of the\nleaders, but I keep them just in sight\nfor the first half of the climb, but\nthen not being able to bridge that gap,\nend up deciding to go my own pace,\ntrying to avoid a full detonation.\nFamily\npodcast, man.\nAnd to give you an idea of how hard this\nclimb was, it took about 22 minutes with\na normalized power of 347 watts, which\nis 96 intensity factor given my FTP. My\naverage heart rate is 188 and it tops\nout at 196. This is the highest heart\nrate I've seen in a long time. Diesel\nkibbit number 19. Pacing is dead.\nDaxton and Finy end up catching me and\nwe end up working quite well together\nfor the next long while.\nAbout halfway through the race, we end\nup catching the best looking guy in\ngravel, Lance Hayd. When I ask him how\nhe's doing, he gives me a haggarded look\nand says, \"Dude, I'm dying.\" But then he\nproceeds to smash the next climb and I\nfind myself dangling on the back of this\ngroup, barely hanging on, hoping that I\ncan stay with this group of four and\nsolidify a top 10.\nAnd all I can think when I'm in this\ngroup with Lance Hayden, Russell\nFinsterwald, and Dax Mock is that there\nis absolutely no way that their heart\nrate is as high as mine or that their\neffort level is as high as mine. And\nthis is just the reality of racing with\npeople who are more talented than you\nare. You're going to have to put out a\nbigger effort to go the same speed. And\nI feel confident saying that because\nLance, Daxton, and Russell all have big\nresults to back up their race history,\nwhereas I just have a long list of\nmediocre\nresults. With only five guys up the\nroad, it seemed it might be possible\nthat we could be racing for a top five\npodium position if one or two of those\nriders from the lead group completely\nblew up and we caught them. But those\nhopes are diminished when a big group of\n10 riders end up catching us on the next\npave section with the likes of Petervak,\nJulian Gier, and Griffin Easter. Now, me\nand Julian were actually sharing a\nbedroom at our host house. And so, the\nbattle for bedroom bragging rights is\nnow fully on.\nDaxton Mock, who during this race told\nme that he was a handling wizard, nearly\nslides out on this paved descent. It was\nkind of scary.\nWe turn onto this dirt road and about a\nmile after that, we're going to enter\ninto a narrow single track section. Now,\nit is crucial for me to be at the front\nof the group going into that trail\nsection because with a group this big,\nthis late in the race, gaps are\ncertainly going to open. And if I want\nto finish near the front of this group,\nI have to position well because we are\nstill racing for sixth\nplace.\nHeat. Heat.\nI'm about midpack and my three\ncompatriots who I had spent most of the\nrace with, Daxton, Lance, and Russell\nare the top three riders and I was\nwishing that I was up there with them,\nbut I do manage to stay with the leaders\nthrough this trail section. However, I\nam starting to feel quite fatigued and\nthe pain is starting to settle in.\nAnd it's not long after that that I end\nup gapped off the back of this group.\nFizzle kibbits number six. Eat more\ncarbs.\nAt this point in the race, I was a\nlittle bit behind my nutrition plan or\nthe carb intake that I had set out for\nmyself. And I knew that this had\nsomething to do with the reason I was\nhitting the wall. It also doesn't help\nthat I had spent the first 3 hours of\nthis race, well over my pacing strategy\nfor a race this long with heart rates in\nthe 180s and 190s, way more than I would\nhave liked. Here's a chart to give you a\nvisual of my power and heart rate\nthroughout each hour of this race. The\nblue bars are showing you my intensity\nfactor with the power above that. And\nthen the red bars are showing you my\naverage heart rate per hour. The main\nthing that I want to point out is how\nhard I went early in this race. From the\ntime we hit the first dirt section until\nwe were caught by that big group of 10\nriders, I was riding well over the pace\nthat I should have been with a\nnormalized power of 317\nor87 intensity factor for nearly 3\nhours. My average heart rate during this\ntime was 182 with a max of 196. It's\nsafe to say I had burnt some matches.\nAnd I'm not just telling you all this to\nmake excuses. I'm telling you this to\ngive you the facts. And the fact is is I\nneed a little bit more durability and a\nlittle bit more fitness so that I can go\nthis hard early in the race and not be\nriding at such a high intensity factor\nand burning so much energy in the first\nhalf of the race so that I have some\nenergy left in the tank for the end of\nthe race. Heat.\nHeat. Heat. Heat.\nOne of the new parts of the course\nincluded these really sharp uphill\nswitchbacks. And the only way that you\ncould really ride these switchbacks was\nto stick out your hand, grab the post,\nand whip around that thing full cycle\ncross mode. And there were a lot of\nthem.\nNear the end of the last dirt section,\nonly about 7 mi from the finish, there\nwas an optional route. You could opt to\ngo further, stay on your bike, and ride\nthrough a creek. Or you could opt to\nturn and go up this really steep hill\nthat forced you to dismount your bike\nand run. I opted for the runup, knowing\nthat it was about a minute faster than\nthe creek crossing. And I went full\ncyclacross mode once again, shouldering\nthe bike all the way up the hill. The\nspectators at the top even told me that\nI was the fastest guy they had seen go\nup that runup section all day. So, while\nI may not have won the race, I won the\nrunup. I'll take it. By taking the\nrunup, I actually end up passing this\nBear Devo kid, Luke from Georgia, who\nopted for the creek crossing. So, I pass\nhim. He ends up catching me, tries to\nblow past me. It doesn't work. I get on\nhis wheel and we're pretty much dead set\non soft pedaling all the way to the\nfinish where we're going to sprint it\nout. Diesel kibbitz number four, always\nsprint. This is a race. We're not here\nto hold hands across the line. We're\nhere to get the best place possible. So,\nthis kid knows I'm gonna sprint him and\nI know he's gonna sprint me because we\nlike to race our bikes. The last turn is\npretty sketchy. It's on gravel and it's\npretty high speed. And Luke makes a\nreally fast last second pass going into\nthat turn. And I'm hoping he's going to\nslide out, but he doesn't. And because\nthe sprint to the line is so short,\nthere's no chance I'm coming around him.\nand he beats me. Well played, young pad\none. I finish in a time of 5 hours and\n15 minutes with a normalized power of\n292, which is8 intensity factor. Average\nheart rate\n176, TSS 341, 4,700 kJ burned. All of\nthis is good enough for 13th place\noverall. Next up, I've got a massive\ntraining block to prepare for the\nUnbound 200. # overtrain or bust. That's\nall I got for this video.

          "transcript": "foreign\nboasts some of the most incredible and\ndiverse scenery that is out there\nand it's hard to feel anything but awe\nin this natural beauty\nRolling Hills covered in lush green\nvegetation\nand the bright colorful flowers that\nline the bike paths just waiting to be\nexplored and taken in\nand there is no better way than by\ntouring aboard two wheels\n[Music]\nas most stories go there was a wild idea\nthrown around\nso we committed to gonna to do the\nBelgium offer ride San Diego down there\nand then we're going to do Levi's Grand\nFondo\nI'm like well we're gonna drive up the\nwhole coast and we'll have you guys ride\nthe weekend between and they go for our\ncoast ride we missed\neasy for you to say because because you\nwere driving right\neasy enough yeah not a bike right now so\nknew I was going to be the driver but\nfigured you guys would\ntake to it pretty easily after a little\nbit of convincing in reality not a bunch\nof convincing was needed\nthe performance bicycle crew consisting\nof Ryan Oaks a drop bar fanatic with a\ncraving for large epic days on two\nwheels\nNick Wallace astrava Kom assassin\nhailing from the Santa Cruz mountains\nJack Johnson\nthe idea maker and former Collegiate\nRunner who finally came around and\npicked up cycling\nand myself Jeffrey Morton a daredevil\nupon two wheels whether that be over\ndirt gravel or tarmac\nwe all set out to Traverse from the\nBelgian wolf ride in San Marcos\nCalifornia\nall the way up to the sea otter classic\nin Monterey\napproximately 500 miles of rolling\ntekali Terrain covering these incredible\nscenic areas\nbut first thing first bwr had to be\nconquered\nand aboard the Richie tandem\nnow not only did we survive bwr\nwe won the tandem race\nbut that's a story for a whole nother\nvideo\nwhich you can actually check out on our\nChannel\nhow are you feeling Monday morning\nrolling into it all\nMonday morning was like\nkind of like being run over by a truck\nalready to start out with\num\nI was\npretty tired\nthe night before in bwr had ended the\nday with a really upset stomach so some\nof the nutrition at the end of the day\nto like get started for the tour wasn't\ngoing great already so\nI woke up feeling feeling tired from bwr\nthen at least getting on the bike felt\nreally good because we've been on the\ntandem before and hopping on a real bike\nwhere\nI wasn't like having to share controls\nwith anyone else and it was like light\nNimble and turned when I wanted it to\nthat felt really good uh when Monday\nmorning came around I felt I'm not gonna\nsay amazing and that sounds a little bit\nfunny because I didn't have to do nine\nhours on the bike like you guys that\nruined the tandem but\num we'd been doing a decent amount of\ndriving and Jack and I followed as much\nas we could around the bwr course on\nSunday so we spent a lot of hours in the\ncar a lot of looking at Maps trying to\nfigure out ways to cut you guys off and\nyou know checking out how you're doing\ndo a little recording take some pictures\nand videos and you know mostly just\nwatch you guys suffer really we just\nleft the house today was supposed to be\nall flat and somehow we are already\nclimbing\nnot off to a great start\nup right here did not ride yesterday so\nof course he's gonna be attacking all\nday long\nnothing but beautiful views for the day\nactually probably for the entire week\nso we had a nice little coffee stop in\nOceanside and now we are going to load\nthe bikes up on the van to get through\nCamp Pendleton so that was probably the\ntrickiest part of the rack to figure out\nwas going through the Marine Military\nbase later just north of Oceanside in\nSan Diego County\num there were there are paths you can\nget to go through for the day but their\nVisitor Center was mysteriously closed\nfor an exposed amount of time since we\nhad the ability to put our bikes in the\ncar and have Jack drive us we decided to\nskip on about a five mile section of\nriding on the side of highway 5 because\nthat not only did it sound dangerous it\njust sounded really unpleasant so we're\nback in Camp Pendleton took off about\nsix miles of our ride in the car but now\nwe are going to be able to ride on some\nroads that are closed to Vehicles so\nit'll be smooth sailing bike path riding\nwas nice because we were removed from\nthe traffic from cars but\nwe had the problem where the bike path\ngoing was was really slow so we just\nwould not be able to travel very fast at\ntimes they had speed limits that were\nkind of not I mean we weren't going the\nspeed limit but\nspeed limits were not favorable and you\noften had to\nhad to slow down just to avoid like\nconflicts with pedestrians so that that\nmade it so we couldn't really Cruise as\nfast as we would have liked to\nafter the multiple hours of suffering\nyesterday at the tail end of bwr it sure\nis nice to be able to recover along the\ncoastline\nfelt like a recovery day we spent a lot\nof time riding down on the beach riding\nkind of on bike paths where it was\nrelatively slow so that was really what\nI needed after doing Belgian waffle ride\nwas to have that day where it was easy\nshort mileage I think we only did like\n70 miles or so something like that it\nwas kept it kept it really mellow but\nonce we got to the beaches and we were\nriding literally on paved bike paths on\nthe beach it was kind of a nice relief\nfrom like typical writing where you kind\nof have this motivation I gotta go I\ngotta you know set this Tempo we got to\nget it done it was a shorter day we had\nplenty of daylight and it was just kind\nof like we took on that beach Vibe and\njust pedaled I actually felt better at\nthe end of day one than I felt at the\nend of Belgian waffle ride so it\ndefinitely like acted as a recovery day\nmy metabolism had kicked up by then I\nwas ready to have dinner I think we had\na couple dinners that night and that was\nreally good\nwe are in Long Beach we're in the hotel\nroom time to rest up time to eat time to\nrecover we'll catch you again tomorrow\nthank you\nall right so morning of day two\nalready tell them slowly more and more\ntired in the morning just probably not\nsleeping as well not enough recovery\nwe're gonna chug along I think about 90\nmiles on tap today we are doing some\nclimbing though just because it's a\nlittle bit boring doing Flats all day\nso let's go eat some food\nPro tip always make sure your hotel has\ncontinental breakfast there's something\nto be said for having hot breakfast\nprepared ready to go and and kind of a\nall-you-can-eat situation because in\nthese kind of trips you just have to\ntake on as many calories as you can\nyou're going to be in deficit the whole\ntime so powdered eggs and you know the\njuice machine that's mostly uh corn\nsyrup and just had all of it yeah should\nbe a nice day today though we're gonna\nstart the day first half of the day\nwe'll be rolling along the coast we're\ngoing to go through some nice beaches\ndown here in La some really nice\nneighborhoods just as we did yesterday\nand then we're gonna head up into the\nmountains just before we hit Malibu try\nand get off the flats for a little bit\nshould be an enjoyable day with the\nclimbing comes descending so\nI'm looking forward to it\nit's about 9 30 a little bit later than\nkind of wanted to roll but we're getting\non the road got\nsix plus hours today potentially\nthe breakfast was the killer like one of\nthe best hotel breakfasts I've ever had\nwhat'd you end up eating Ryan for the\nbiscuits and gravy and then the waffle\nyeah I put some chocolate chips and\nwalnuts in the waffle so good\nso we're about\n40 minutes in and roughly 10 MI\nmile quick you can go from the dense\nCity to some like lush green trees\nnice little area passing through Long\nBeach was very industrial and\nreally not the most enjoyable place to\nbe riding a lot of semi trucks coming\nthrough there rough road holes and all\nkinds of debris inside of the um\nside of the shoulder where we were it\nwas a section to be tolerated because\nthere weren't any better routes but\nit wasn't wasn't something that any of\nus really liked\na nice little jaunt through some Rolling\nHills we are back along the coast\noh got some good views ahead\nwell we were cruising along the beach on\nthe bike path and now we have entered a\nlittle pier I guess and it is no writing\nzone so we have a bike path so we're\nsupposed to walk\njust another one of those things that's\ngoing to extend our day when we're not\nriding\nlet's get moving\njust Highway and getting off of one\nsections of it are awesome to ride other\nsections are just Highway and we've been\non a decent amount of the highway kind\nof stuff that day so it was really nice\nto just not have to be kind of\nanxious about cars behind you and have\ngetting this to really high rates of\nspeed so we have reached Malibu and are\nabout to take our lunch stop our\nGuardian Angel Jack over here prepared\nsandwiches\nso let's eat now we got some smart\nthinking over here what's going on\nwell I didn't want to have to hold the\nbagel sandwich and my beer so\nthe bag will be held by my beer\na bottle get a little bit of peanut\nbutter a little bit of jelly and some\nbeer that's ideal I was totally hungry\nthere and so eating\nsandwiches right there right before we\nhit the climb was probably a little\nlittle more than I should have but at\nthe same time I just want to take in the\ncalories\nfelt really good to go head uphill\nwe have been doing a lot of flat riding\nand it got to be a little boring there's\na lot of traffic so going up Latigo\nCanyon you had this like quiet road\nwhere all of a sudden like there were\nprobably only like three or four cars we\nsaw out there the whole time the road\nsurface was perfect\nand it just really had was a nice change\nfor the day and yeah that day I felt I\nstill felt pretty good you know the the\nfatigue hadn't really started to\naccumulate too much for me\num I think the the Mellow Pace on the\nbeach that morning kind of meant it\nmeant that we'd had a long day out just\nbecause we couldn't go very fast but we\nhadn't had to work really really hard we\ngot awesome climbing and descending in\num we sort of dropped down into kind of\ndropped into some Farmland right on the\nback side and that's super familiar for\nme like Harrigan and Chico we have tons\nof that so I knew that the guys like we\nhad a big trip ahead yet and obviously\nboth Jeff and Nick were pretty in the\nhole from the Sunday ride doing the big\nmile so I kind of took put it upon\nmyself to make sure I tried to take as\nmuch wind as possible and help get us\nhome first signs of fatigue were there\nbecause that was the first bigger day of\nthe ride got some good climbing in\num and then it's a pretty grueling Edwin\nsection the flats rolling home from out\nof the mountains there\num it's understandably getting tired\nafter that's day three of big riding so\nI think that's when you guys really\nstarted to go into the hole started to\nhurt a little later on that day\num as we neared kind of the end of the\nday I think that the fatigue from\nBelgian waffle ride started to catch up\nto me a little and we start we hit some\nsections with headwind and\nthe legs were starting to complain about\nit a bit I don't think I fully cramped\nup but definitely I'm struggling a\nlittle there\nI'm not always the best at sleeping in\nhotels but on this trip it was not a\nproblem at all I was just like got to\nthe end of the day we'd go get some food\nget back to the hotel and as soon as\npossible we're pretty much going to\nsleep to try and get as as much time in\nthe bed as we could\nall right Tuesday morning\nstarted day three just woke up 7 A.M\n7 A.M wake UPS aren't too bad\nexcept for when you feel like you need\n12 hours of sleep that's when they're\npretty brutal\nheading to hotel breakfast I'm gonna try\nand eat 5 000 calories before we head\nout\nyeah let's do it\nall kidded up\ngot that sunscreen applied it's gonna be\na warm one today should be in at least\napproaching the 70s it's been kind of\nchilly the last couple days on the coast\nbut we're gonna head up to Santa Barbara\nfrom Santa Barbara we'll be heading into\nthe Hills\nand then stopping I believe in Santa\nMaria this evening 110 miles on tap\njust under 6K of climbing\nI was still feeling pretty good I knew\nagain you guys were just deeper in the\nhold of me and I figured we'd find kind\nof this Equalization point at some point\nin the tour where maybe I'd done enough\nwork early on and you guys had saved\nenough matches that we'd all kind of be\non the same plane so I was just trying\nto make sure I was doing a little doing\nmy fair share and also like we at that\npoint I was getting to be honest you\nknow it was beautiful being on the\nbeaches but I was getting kind of sick\nof riding the beach bike paths because\nthey have the speed limit and it was\nreally easy to get out there and be like\ncool we're gonna pedal 12 miles an hour\nand with a similar amount of effort we\ncould be going so much faster so it was\none of those things of like this today's\na long day I don't want to be out here\nfor like total time of nine hours I want\nto make sure we get in a reasonable\nreasonable hour so it's kind of like hey\nlet's cruise you know get it going get\nit done\nafter a few hours of cruising today we\nhave landed ourselves in beautiful Santa\nBarbara\ngot all these palm trees lying in the\nbeach cruising time to go find some\ncoffee foreign\nout of town we had a small rock on the\nroad\num that it wasn't even a large Rock just\nkind of came up and slashed my sidewall\nand it was a pretty frustrating\nsituation overall because it became\nactually quite apparent after staring at\nit for a few minutes that it was going\nto be impossible for us to fix with what\nwe had on our person Jack was already\nwell ahead of us long gone so we were\nkind of on our own at that point\nfortunately we were still in town\nbut we actually had a\na valve a tubeless valve snap off it was\ncorroded and it broke you off entirely\nI've had plenty of times that the the\nvalve core will break from you know\nusing your pump on it this was the\nentire valve just snapped which was kind\nof a new experience and in doing so it\nfrayed all the threads so we couldn't\nundo the valve nuts it was stuck on so\nwe couldn't even put a tube in\num so fortunately Nick was smart and he\nfound a bike shop close by a walking\ndistance walked to Bike Shop got it\nfixed but I mean the probably 15-20\nminutes of trying to fix it a few\nminutes walking to the bike shop explain\nto The Bike Shop when you need to be\ndone having them help us out then fixing\nthe flat and doing it and getting it\ngoing I mean in an hour you know of\nsomething that should have been a quick\nfix going down to Santa Barbara we\ndecided to go up to climb out of there\non I think it was old San Marcos road\nwhich was um\nreally nice climb pretty steep though at\nplaces and very hot and sunny\nbut seemed like a better option than\ngoing either North up 101 or going\nacross like the main highway there it\nwas nice to have a road that avoided\nsome of the worst traffic\njust made it to the top of the climb\noutside of Santa Barbara now we get to\ndescend down to our lunch spot\nso\nwe're descending down to the lunch spot\nI was leading\nRyan flooded\nnow we are climbing back up\nmake sure he's got all the stuff he\nflooded earlier so you might need a tube\nwe were on the world's smoothest\ncleanest piece of asphalt descending\ndown it was close to traffic so I was\nusing the center lane center of the lane\ngoing down the thing and as we were kind\nof there's some tight bends and a decent\namount of speed and as we laid into a\nturn I just felt my kind of rear end\nshift around and like what does that\nstarted doing that kind of bounce up and\ndown check am I making this up is it\njust me and\num I was pretty confident it was going\nflat and didn't realize the room was\nbogging I'm trying to yell up to Nick\nbecause you guys are screaming on ahead\nand joining The Descent and I'm about to\nyou know have to pull over and fix it\nflat so I pulled over and it was on the\nsame tire but it wasn't related to the\nslash I previously it was actually just\na puncture some something had to come in\ncome out and punctured the tube I had in\nthere at that point\nby the time we got the lake I was\nalready feeling a little tired we had\nalready done some big climbing\nand I was hungry so yeah we\nI think once again I either like peanut\nbutter and jelly sandwich got some ice\ncream got a soda\nI feel I feel like I was just pretty\nhungry at that point ready to eat just\nabout everything\nafter a nice\nlong lunch stop we're back on the road\nheading to Santa Maria\nand we got a pretty much either a\nblockhead wind or a cross headwind the\nwhole way so this next\n30 miles about\nis gonna be\nhow do you put it\nput it not so pleasant\nI took to the front right away just\nbecause it's like this is my bad for\nthese Flats my mechanical let's see if\nwe can just like get some Tempo going\ntrying to flush out the lunch legs after\nlunch and uh\nit wasn't long before I'd kind of used\nmost of my batches and I think we were\nall relying on you to tell us the rest\nof the way pretty much we realized I\ndon't know what were we halfway through\nthe day in mileage and that was kind of\nfor me like a you know Red Alert I had\nthe alarm Bells going off of like we're\nwell into the afternoon and we've only\ndone half of the day's miles and we've\nbeen out here so long already we need to\nreally like scramble and get this thing\ndone or we're going to find ourselves\nout after dark we are down in the valley\npowering the final\n10 to 15 miles right now\nit started to really hurt especially\nwhen we hit any kind of false flat or\nclimb and then anytime there was a\ncrosswind as well because I wasn't able\nto get a draft and like Jeff was feeling\nreally good you were like just totally\ncrushing the flats and had to kind of\nyell up to Jeff a couple times and be\nlike\nwe gotta back off a little bit because\nit was totally hurting me and I was\ngetting dropped it was it may have been\ndownhill on paper but you could have\ncommenced me\nthe other one far as the pace goes my\nlike comfortable pace for all day might\nhave been just maybe like one or two\nmiles per hour slower\num there's still that like I think all\nof us kind of agreed that\nwe all have this mentality where the\nfaster you go\nthe sooner you're done so that I think\nwe all kind of agree agree on and we're\nwilling to suffer a little bit for that\nwe made it to Santa Maria\nthat was a hard one the whole final\n20 miles either Blockhead wind or\ncrosswind it was quite brutal\nbut we made it end of day three time to\nfuel up\ngo get a bunch of food I think we're\ngonna need two dinners tonight and then\nget some sleep wake up and do the same\nthing tomorrow all right dinner number\none down Chick-fil-A two chicken\nsand sandwiches Sandos\n12 piece nuggets fries brownie time for\ndinner number two we have Jack going in\nand grabbing our Chipotle kids meals\nfive dollars\nthat's the hack\ngood morning day four\nwe are riding from\nSanta Maria to King City very small\nbut another 120 mile day so can't take\nit lightly\nI feel pretty good got a couple of extra\nhours of sleep last night\nso time to get some breakfast fuel up\nfor the ride\nanother hotel breakfast down the hole\nsausage eggs build your own waffles\nboy waffles are good\nI don't think I'm gonna eat them for\nanother month after this trip though\nbut got a little stinky bun thing for\nthe road so\nride food gonna need a lot of that I\nthink that was maybe the first night\nafter day three where we had a pretty\nserious discussion about yesterday took\nlonger than it should have and a lot of\nthe challenge was because it's typically\na little more calm in the morning and\nmuch more windy in the afternoon and we\nwere out way deep into the afternoon so\nwe kind of had this idea of let's all\nagree to like let's get up a little bit\nearlier let's try and beat some of the\nwin I remember like the alarm going off\nyou know just kind of throwing some\nstuff on walking over to the Best\nWestern Hotel Bobby for some breakfast\nand setting food outside immediately\ninto a really strong wind at like seven\nin the morning and thinking\nyeah we didn't meet with it all this is\ngonna suck\ntime to roll out\n8 30 just about\n120 miles ahead so hunker down get it\ndone how you feeling Nick\npretty good\nsweet Ryan how are you feeling\nall right excellent for a nice eight\nhour day\nrolling out and like making a point to\nget an early start and seeing that wind\nwas a little demoralizing especially\nsince it was going to be headwind for\nmost of the day\nthere is a town limit city limit a\ncounty limit sign\nI'm used to looking around and\nan important jumping for it and I don't\nsee any reason to tour you know in a\nlong trip like this should be any\nexception to that so we had we had quite\na bit of fun especially I think what\nreally added to That Fun was we were in\nan unknown environment so right in your\nown backyard you kind of start to know\nwhere those Sprint points are and you\nknow kind of what your timing is when\nyou go on this this stuff you know you\nmaybe know the Count's coming up you\nknow the the clues the the speed limit\nsigns change and you can start to see\nmore traffic more buildings but you\ndon't know where that spread point is\ngoing to be\nI may have been hurting on the day and\nlike was didn't have much energy but\nsometimes the drive to just like go for\nthose City Limits Sprints was a good way\nto kind of like\nshake myself out of the monotony for a\nminute I think the whole the whole crew\ncaught on board with it we're frustrated\nwhen Nick would see a sign nobody else\ndid or we'd have some pretty intense uh\nintense battles for some of these silly\nlittle towns and all over the coast so\nwe are about an hour and a half in\n9.8 miles we've been cruising it trying\nto get it done\nput in the work early\nenjoy it later good\ncoffee stop in the next five ish miles\nload up on caffeine some pastries\nand then keep on rolling\nafter taking like a coffee shop in um\nSan Luis Obispo we rolled up a gravel\nroad out of there and\nI flattened on a i flatted on a like\nrock it was something that probably like\nusually would not have given me a flat\ntire but annoyingly it was a big\nsidewalk Ash and that created some\nissues and took it took quite a while\ntrying to fix it and then eventually\nended up not being able to plug it and\nhaving to put a tube in which really\nkind of fed us back probably over half\nan hour on the day just trying to repair\nthe tube and stopping like two or three\ntimes to try and do that\ntires supposed to feel anymore\nNick had the realization like hey the\nroad up here like we're seeing signs\nit's gonna be out should we turn around\nI think there's a go around or should we\ncontinue on let's just go look at it and\nsee and we continued on I mean the road\nliterally went to the edge and then it\njust like sheer cliffed off you know 10\nfeet down into a river like the whole\nBridge Road was completely gone\num and there was about 10 seconds of\ndebating do we turn around\nmy shoes off and I got my shoulder I'm\nwalking across I'm not going back back\njust loaded up on lunch and passovers\nkind of nice\npesto wrap now we are back on the road\ngot another 60-ish Miles Ahead\nand then we get to our destination in\nKing City\nFlorida to get this knocked out\nnot too much support this next 60 miles\nbe Barren so we are going to probably\nmeet up with our driver Jack in a couple\nhours to possibly refuel one I think we\nhad to ride 101 for\nand um there's whatever the base was at\nRichardson or something one of the\nmilitary bases was right there past a\nfew military bases one of the bases we\nhad to exit near there and that was um\nlooking forward to getting off the\nhighway and we had a city limits Sprint\nright there and in this case a county\nlimit Sprint we all kind of stood up and\nwent for it exiting the highway and and\nyou know it was and exciting to see like\nMonterey County or destinations Monterey\nlike Monterey's in Monterey County you\nknow really really cool but it was like\nsomeone drew a line right there like the\nroad went from pretty good to like maybe\nsome of the like worst roads you could\nride or would want to ride on a road\nbike\num just chip seal a pothole and cracked\nand\nincredibly poor Road surface and it was\njust like that for us today I think\nthere was no it never improved we are\ndown in the valley approaching King City\nat about 20\n. and at one point I think after meeting\nup with him we've got one more stop and\nI was keeping a decent eye on my phone\nand saw a text come through from him\nthat said hey I just got to this town\nthat we were planning on going to this\nconvenience store and it's a ghost town\nright and said the text for a few\nspecial requests and Micheladas I had to\nlet them know that poisons that was all\nclosed but there was a spot about five\nmiles back from where I was that's a\nlittle similar type convenience store\nthat I figured would probably have them\nflip surround comes flying past us the\nwrong direction stops off of the store\nand we're all kind of fingers crossed as\nto whether they're even gonna have them\nthere and and then he catches back up to\nus and pulls over and he just pulls out\nthe grocery bag and he's got four of\nthem and oh dude and that thing like\nit's the lifeler just revitalized me for\nthat last bit of the day right\nMicheladas Down the Hatch time to knock\nout the final 20.\noh\npretty much downhill into town we got\nthis big steep descent that you know\ntook us up easily 40 50 miles an hour\nbut once that descent ran out at the\nbottom it was still like this false flat\ndownhill into town and the wind must\nhave been blown Blockhead at like 30\nmiles an hour and I remember like\nlooking down thinking I'm doing about\n300 watts sitting on Jeff's wheel in\nthis headwind and we are going 15 miles\nan hour it was uh\nthat was like maybe the hardest part of\nthe entire tour I think\nat that point coming into King City I\nhad already like\nlike spent every match I had and we\nturned onto this little bike path and I\nthink the winter storms had like flooded\nover it and it was covered in sand and I\njust like you guys powered through it\nyou still had a little bit of power left\nin your legs and you're able to kind of\nlike spin that high Cadence get through\nthe sand I started going through it it\nwas like oh I'm not making it anywhere\nso it ended up being a good amount of\nwalking through sand to end the day\nwhich was was a tough way to do it\ntell everyone at home how you're feeling\nI think I had like some leftover food\nfrom earlier in the day I ate that and\ntook a shower and fell asleep I didn't\neven make it to go join you guys for\ndinner that night I was\ntotally cracked getting over the Midway\nhump of the tour and knowing like hey\ntomorrow's last day there's sort of this\nlight at the end of the tunnel you know\nfinishing wind kind of a thing where\nwe've just had the hardest\ntwo days and then four days really\naccumulated together but tomorrow's a\nshorter day and tomorrow's the last day\nand I kind of revitalizing like feeling\nthat too\ntime to eat up\nrecover\nwe got one more day on tap\nMonterey here we come\nit is morning on day five we are in King\nCity\nlimited options as far as hotels go in\nso we do not have Hotel breakfast this\nmorning\nbut\nI stocked up at Denny's last night got\nsome little strawberry pancake bites\nNick rolled over to BK got a good old\nbreakfast burrito\nwe're gonna eat up\nI think we're actually gonna head to\nSafeway get some more food\nwe're all really hungry at this point\nbut only six miles to go so we'll be at\nsea otter the early afternoon\nand have reached our destination\nthere's a few fast food chains we've\neaten at Denny's the night before so we\nkind of had this little debate are we\ngoing to Safeway I'm going to get you\nknow kind of deli sandwiches and maybe\ngrab a you know refrigerated coffee\nthere or there's a Starbucks and we get\nStarbucks sandwiches and some coffee\nthere\nand we kind of settled on like Starbucks\nis close by let's just do that real fast\nwe're in King City stopped at Starbucks\nto decaffeinate up before we head out\nand what do you know we happen to run\ninto Tyler Pierce and Jeremiah Bishop\nover here they're doing the exact same\nroute as we are riding from bwr all the\nway up to sea otter\nI think we're gonna go ahead and cruise\ntogether for a little bit\npretty funny that they had the same idea\nas us to do the Belgium waffle ride and\nthen commute you know from the Belgium\nwhile sea otter and we just happened to\nland in the same city for the last day\nwhich was just like a wild coincidence\nI've been riding together for the last\nfour days and you gotta run out of\nconversation at some point so that a new\nperson to talk to and you kind of\ndistract myself from what's going on so\nit's great to get to chat with those\nguys and hang out and find out you know\ntheir motivation for the trip uh it\nreally I did thought it gave me\ndefinitely a second win change the\ndynamic it changed the energy in the\ngroup it's\nwe were having that light at the end of\nthe tunnel thing we knew it was a\nshorter day we knew you know Monterey is\njust as hell as they're away from where\nwe were to add in two more bodies that\nenable bodies capable of pedaling was\nkind of nice like we were we didn't have\num as big a day on Deck so we didn't\nhave to really put down hard hard Pace\nnot only do we get a cruise\nsimple 45 miles today but we get a ride\non the flats\nand it's not too windy that is such a\ngood change of pace after the last\ncouple days of foraging that headwind\nthe crosswinds\nso good to Simply Cruise now I'm uh\nliving my best life sitting here second\nfield just watching the scenery Roll by\nlike a\nlike a conveyor belt\nso good all right let's keep knocking it\nright hey I have to say like rolling\neasy felt good felt like I could have\nrolled that pace all day and gone\nanother 40 miles if we had to but when\nwe rolled up to sea otter and it was\nmaybe like 60 miles into the day or so I\nwas happy to be done you kind of forget\nthat you know Laguna Seca the Raceway\nit's it's up on this hill and then down\nin a bowl and the hill that they take\nyou up is super steep so\nI mean\nit's really really Steep and at the end\nof a long long week it's like not what\nyou want to do but like seeing the sign\nit doesn't matter because you're done\nlike you've accomplished it you know you\nmade it like you questioned could I go\nfrom point A to point B in the span of\ntime with this many miles per day and\nyou see that sound you're like oh I did\nit I I did it like it's it's over you\nknow it's it was totally doable\num yeah it's it's a it's a pretty cool\nfeeling of just like sweet maybe the\nweirdest feeling is like oh I don't have\nto do this again tomorrow that's that's\nprobably the most bizarre thing on on\nthis kind of stuff but yeah seeing the\nsinus was so awesome kind of a sense of\naccomplishment like that was a big a big\ntour and it was pretty cool to like\nroll up to this big cycling convention\nkind of had a really great energy around\nit a bunch of our our team members were\nthere at the event running around doing\ntheir thing and we'd all kind of\ncoordinated to meet up when we got there\nit was so so fun to get to see people\nthat you don't see that often and find\nout how they're doing and they're\nthey're asking the same about us and\nwe're we're sharing some of the kind of\ntop of Mind stories about like the\nantics of the trip and little nuanced\nthings here there and just laughing\nhaving a good time Ander had a\ncaricature artist drawing\num drawing portraits of people at their\nBooth so Jeffrey and I decided to sit\ndown and um have our characters drawn\non the tandem so we got this great\nsouvenir souvenir art piece from that of\nus riding the tandem together which was\npretty cool the ultimate way maybe to to\ncap it off yeah I can't think of a\nbetter way to do it\nand with that our journey comes to a\nclose\n475 miles traversing the Southern\nCalifornia beaches Coastal canyons and\nthe Inland valleys\nthe memories and experiences from this\njourney will forever be remembered in\nour hearts\nI know that this is just the beginning\nof our exploration of the world on two\nthere are countless more roads to be\ndiscovered more Adventures to be had and\nmore stories to be told\nso whether you're an avid cyclist or\nsimply an admirer of Nature's Beauty\nI encourage you to embark on your own\nJourney\nto chase the Horizon and to discover the\nWonders that awaits you\nbecause there's nothing quite like the\nfeeling of freedom and discovery\nthat comes with a bike ride through the\nstunning Landscapes of California\nuntil our paths cross again\nmay your Journeys be filled with\nbreathtaking views Unforgettable moments\nand the pure joy of writing\nkeep pedaling keep exploring\nand keep embracing the beauty of the\nworld around you",
