        "explanation": "BWR San Diego IS the original. The OG. The granddaddy that spawned an entire series across North America. It's the Queen Leg of the Quad-Tripel Crown and attracts the biggest names in gravel: Peter Stetina, Keegan Swenson, Alexey Vermeulen, Matt Beers. When Michael Marckx created this in 2012, he established a blueprint that the entire gravel world has tried to copy. 15 years of history and counting."
      },
      "race_quality": {
        "score": 5,
        "explanation": "Monuments of Cycling has refined this into a flawless production over 15 editions. Canyon sponsorship brings serious budget. Multiple aid stations, SAG support until cutoff, professional timing, comprehensive expo, and the famous route secrecy that builds anticipation. The Saturday Roadie-Oh Gran Fondo adds a full weekend festival experience. This is how elite gravel events should be run."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 5,
        "explanation": "Life-changing is not hyperbole here. Riders describe it as 'absolutely heinous and perfect' and struggle to comprehend all the experiences from a single day. The highs and lows, the suffering through 23 off-road sectors, the camaraderie with fellow survivors, the Belgian-themed celebration culture with actual waffles and Belgian ales - BWR delivers an unforgettable experience that changes how you think about what's possible on a bike."
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "BWR has cultivated a passionate tribe of 'kasseien-crushing winnaars' who return year after year. The Belgian classics heritage creates unique shared language and culture. However, the extreme difficulty (30-40% DNF) means this isn't the most welcoming entry point for gravel newbies. The community is tight but demands you earn membership through suffering."
      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 5,
        "explanation": "The elite field is stacked. Matt Beers won back-to-back in 2024-2025. Keegan Swenson, Peter Stetina, Alexey Vermeulen have all taken victories. Sofia Gomez Villafane dominates the women's field. As part of the Quad-Tripel Crown series, serious gravel racers must compete here for overall standings. The field depth rivals any gravel event in North America."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "At $195+ for entry, BWR is premium priced but delivers premium value: full weekend festival, expo access, multiple aid stations, SAG support, timing chip, post-race waffles and finisher's beer. The 15-year prestige, quality production, and life-changing experience justify the cost. You're not just buying a race entry - you're buying access to gravel royalty."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Total trip cost is moderate for an elite event. San Diego has abundant accommodation options across price points. Flights to SAN are competitive from most US cities. Del Mar area isn't cheap but Escondido offers budget options. Figure $195 entry + $150-300/night hotel + $200-500 flights + food/misc. You can do BWR for under $1,000 total if you're smart, or splash out on beach resort recovery."
      },
      "length": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "At 119-144 miles depending on year's route, BWR sits firmly in the ultra-endurance category without crossing into full 200-mile insanity. The variable distance reflects the organizers' penchant for route secrecy and annual tweaks, but expect to spend 6-15 hours in the saddle depending on your fitness level."
      },
      "technicality": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "This is NOT a smooth gravel road race. Lake Hodges delivers genuinely technical single-track with rocky, sandy sections that demand real MTB skills. Sandy Bandy (Raptor Ridge) is notorious for flatting bikes on sharp rocks. Del Dios Gorge adds single-track transitions. Forum consensus: 'fun on a hardtail, notable on a gravel bike, stressful on 28c road tires.' Riders report walking sections if skills aren't there."
      },
      "elevation": {
        "score": 5,
        "explanation": "10,000-14,000 ft of total climbing is brutal, but the sadistic genius is placement. The Muur van Dubbelberg (Double Peak) arrives in the final 10 miles - a 4.5-mile climb with 1,800 ft gain including 20-23% pitches when your legs are already destroyed from 110+ miles. Black Canyon adds 11 miles of relentless climbing toward Palomar. Dreams are crushed here."
      },
      "climate": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "San Diego in May offers near-ideal racing conditions: 70-78F highs, low humidity (46%), minimal rain risk, and 75% sunny days. The main challenges are 'May Gray' morning marine layer, afternoon coastal headwinds, and temperature swings between coast and inland sections. Compared to Kansas heat or Colorado storms, this is relatively benign."
      },
      "altitude": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Start and finish at sea level near Del Mar. While the course climbs inland toward Palomar Mountain, the race doesn't hit sustained high altitude that would affect oxygen availability. Mesa Grande represents the highest point but doesn't approach the 9,000+ ft threshold for significant altitude impact."
      },
      "logistics": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "San Diego International Airport is only 25 miles from the venue with easy freeway access. Del Mar area offers abundant accommodation options from beach resorts to budget hotels in Escondido. The venue itself (Del Mar Polo Fields) provides ample parking. California infrastructure makes this one of the more accessible elite gravel events - no remote Wyoming ranch logistics here."
      },
      "adventure": {
        "score": 5,
        "explanation": "This is a bucket-list gravel event, full stop. The deliberate recreation of Belgian Spring Classics suffering, the 15-year heritage as THE original American waffle ride, the ridiculous 30-40% DNF rate, the legendary Double Peak death march - it all adds up to a life-changing experience. Finishing covered in dust after 12+ hours earns you membership in a very select club. The post-race waffles and Lost Abbey beers taste like vindication."
