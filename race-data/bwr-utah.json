        "explanation": "Whitney Allison's gap grew steadily from mile 58 separation to 9 minutes by mile 100, showing how the 127-mile Waffle rewards sustained power over explosive moves. The 74-mile Wafer captures 68% unroad character without the full commitment. Melisa Rollins noted extending beyond her four-hour training range into hour six territory challenged her cramping tolerance. Longer than Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego. As Michael Marckx [ELITE perspective] puts it: \"We go into a mountain bike park for seven miles and wind our way through that on really flowy, nice, singletrack. With bridges and fun terrain stuff.\""

        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "The mile 116 Tolweg section features \"rocks, three dozen turns, boulders\" that left riders \"weeping or whooping\" based on singletrack skills. Melisa Rollins felt \"completely under-biked\" despite being a mountain biker, while Lindsay Goldman's split-second decision to ride rather than run the rocky sections secured her 2nd place finish. More technical than most — comparable to Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

        "explanation": "Mt. Kanarraberg's \"brutal climb stretching over 2.6 miles at punishing gradients\" is where Joe Goettl went solo for his 2025 victory. The Kanarra Mountain climb \"averages 10 percent\" over roughly three miles, appearing on the horizon at mile 108. Multiple riders reported cramping issues on these extended high-gradient efforts at altitude. Among the hilliest in gravel, comparable to Badlands."

        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Historical weather data shows average highs of 73°F and lows of 47°F, with a 15% chance of rain on any given day. 2025 conditions started with \"cool morning air around the low 50s\" before temperatures \"crept toward the 80s\" as riders battled \"sun and dry desert air.\" Persistent headwinds from mile 42-97 determine finishing rates, while Joe Goettl benefited from \"a ripping tailwind\" during his solo breakaway to victory. Milder conditions than Crusher in the Tushar."

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "The 5,800-6,000 foot starting elevation sits in that zone where sea level riders feel it but adaptation isn't required. Melisa Rollins experienced unprecedented cramping in \"both quads, both adductors, and calves\" during hour six, questioning whether altitude contributed to her first-ever full-body cramping episode at this race distance. Modest altitude compared to Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

        "explanation": "Part of the BWR Series Quad-Tripel Crown where your top 3 finishes out of 4 races count - that's real series credibility. Six years deep and they're still tweaking courses, dropping all-new routes for 2026 that promise to separate the committed from the curious. The BWR brand carries weight in gravel circles, even if Utah doesn't have the household name recognition of some other stops."
      },
      "race_quality": {
        "score": 5,
        "explanation": "The 2021 separate women's start eliminated \"sifting through stifling dust\" and created \"a united group\" before the racing began, leveling the playing field. Five feed zones on the Waffle provide strategic refueling, while course variety spans mountain bike parks, motocross tracks, singletrack, and gravel roads across multiple terrain types."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 5,
        "explanation": "Flavia Oliveira Parks felt she \"got the monkey off my back\" after her first BWR victory, noting \"it never lets up out there.\" The combination of technical rock gardens, sustained climbing, and desert conditions creates what riders call the \"hell of the west\" reputation, demanding strategy for nutrition, pacing, and bike handling simultaneously."

        "explanation": "Three distance options from the 35-mile Wanna up to the 127-mile Waffle create natural field separation. The technical demands and altitude factor mean only riders with skills and fitness show up for the full distance. KOM/QOM and King/Queen of Dirt competitions add competitive layers beyond just finishing. Deeper field than most — comparable to Badlands. As Melisa Rollins puts it: \"I actually was pretty frustrated with gravel because I didn't feel like I was strong enough to really race. I was always kind of a participant and finished in that middle-pack range.\""

Cedar City's welcoming community creates a destination race weekend, though the remote location limits combining with other major events for travel efficiency."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Registration runs $180-$250. Cedar City keeps lodging costs reasonable compared to Park City or Moab, but you're still looking at flights to Salt Lake City and a drive south. The remote location means you can't easily combine this with other major races. May timing avoids peak summer tourism rates, but spring travel costs add up when you factor in gear shipping for technical terrain. Similar expense level to Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

      "should_you_race": "Show up if you can handle bike handling at 6,000 feet where thin air meets technical terrain. The 92% unroad isn't just marketing speak—it's sand, rock, and singletrack that punishes hesitant front wheels and rewards desert racing experience. Skip it if you think gravel means smooth fire roads or you've never raced above 4,000 feet.",

The inaugural edition of 2020 was the first big gravel race I'd taken on, and it lit the fire in me to peruse this crazy kind of racing. 2025 was our 5th year competing here and we came here on a mission.

          "transcript": "[Music]\nn\nall right here we are Cedar City one day\nout from the Belgian waide Utah\nyeah last year was a good year got ninth\nhere so I'm pretty excited for this race\nthis year they decided to spice it up a\nlittle bit more I believe last year they\nwere going to add some single track a\nbunch of people started complaining and\nthey took it out I just got done riding\nit and I 100% see why those people were\ncomplaining about it pretty techy\nprobably the most technical single track\nI have ridden in bwr and I've done this\none I've done Kansas and I've done Cali\nnow however I love it being a mountain\nbiker I think it'll be a good Advantage\nfor me for me how many miles is the race\ntomorrow 127 mil in the past it's been a\nlittle over 6 hours however this is\ndefinitely going to add a little bit of\ntime yeah um I'm excited for the race\nthis is this one suits me well I hold\nthis one near and dear been ninth twice\ndone this race twice but if I get ninth\ntomorrow I'm going to be real mad so I'm\neither getting top five or I'm getting\n30th so going go SCH I don't like that\nanswer okay why would you say 30th\nbecause we're going to go for it\num not going to go over the whole bike\num but Just Tires running the pelli\ncentur a gravel H's and a size 40 Tor\ninserts 33 in the front 35 in the rear\nPSI um that's all you need to know\nalready got some pancakes made for\nbreakfast so trying to take a book out\nof\nbook P try try and take a book out of\nKeegan's page here pancakes for\nbreakfast and 100% pure maple syrup is\nthe key ingredient there right all right\nlet's do this let's do\nthis why is this\nhappening hello and good evening this is\nKendra ghetto here reporting live from\nCedar City reporting on the Belgian\nwaffle ride of 202 23 starting tomorrow\nat 7 a.m. um should take them hopefully\nunder 7 hours believe yeah opening the\ncome home with a\nPodium that's all I have for you I like\nthe\nWiggle all right so seven bottles 1 2 3\n4 6 7 these\n7even scratch super high car 400\ncalories 100 G carbs a bottle that\nbottle regular I'm going to start with\nthat one and this one and the plan is to\nget one of these at each stop then just\nuh mix between scratched sh and liquid\nGoose probably mostly these I like these\nliquid they go down super easy also\nthough I'm going to carry some extra of\nthese just in case something goes wrong\nand my wifey doesn't make it to one of\nthe eight stations or something happens\nalways good to have the extra fuel\nnumbers on the bike\ndown here because arrow is everything\nthey said don't bend it I didn't bend it\nit's flat it's just a more arrowy\nflat good morning it's\nRy all right just got to get the pins on\nherea on the other side\nall right here we are inside the Belgium\nW for ride Cedar City just got through\nthe tunnel at Mile 4 the first year I\ndid it I thought that'd be pretty big\npinch point but as long as you're up top\n50 Riders honestly you're pretty fine\nthere's really four key points in this\nrace um I've identified that I want to\nbe at the front and the first one is\ncoming up here at Mile 19 as we head\ninto the first real off-road section\nI made it through the first few zigzags\nof this off-road section and I'm slotted\nin nicely in third wheel as we start the\nfirst k this climb took a total of 8\nminutes and 49 seconds to get up and I\naveraged 351 for the total duration with\nthe last 2 and 1/2 minutes or so at 432\nWatts um so nothing too crazy here as we\ngot to the top I did sag back just a\nlittle bit but I did want to stay up far\nenough just to stay out of trouble if\nthere was a crash or anything\nhe\nand with that the first decisive section\nis down and we cruise to the first aid\nstation I pick up a bottle from my wife\nof some super Fuel and from here we kind\nof form a nice group on the\nroad Carter and one other Rider were off\nthe front but as we all begin to rotate\nquite nicely together it doesn't take us\ntoo long to catch them and we enter the\nnext section which is 12 Mi of flat to\nRolling Hills nothing crazy here um I\nthink it took us about 30 minutes to get\nthrough this section and add a\nnormalized power of about 248 watt so\nmainly just trying to conserve here as\nthe next section of the race proves to\nbe one of the hardest Parts it's called\nthe bald Hills and it's a Jeep Trail\nwith a slight incline going up but it's\nsuper Rocky and if you get just a little\nbit off your line um you can get kind of\nhung up so in the years past this has\nalways blown the field apart and it's\nbeen the deciding sector of what becomes\nthe main lead group for the rest of the\nday\nmakee\nwee make a\nmexic God damn it\n[Applause]\nwell as you can see things kind of went\na little bit to here this was the\nthird of the four places that I wanted\nto be at the front of the race and I was\nright in the right spot coming in um but\nCody came up the inside and I kind of\nmessed up my line wasn't in the right\ngear and couldn't pedal and fell over\nthen l Lally got passed by everyone and\nat this point in my head I am slightly\nthinking that my race is over in years\npast the sand section has lasted super\nlong fortunately for me this year it\nreally wasn't that bad all the moisture\nthey've had has really kept it more\npacked down I did have to put in a huge\neffort to get back up but I was able to\ncatch back up with the front and\neveryone was kind of riding on the right\nside and I just knew that there was\nanother tough little Andy Hill coming um\nafter this left turn so I popped myself\nin the left lane and got right back\nwhere I needed to be um into the front\nof the\nrace always on go feel like I'm never I\nget S SW time to Let It Go got me going\ndumb like I'm illiterate know you\nfeeling it I got you feeling this heat\nride have you ever stayed up to the\nsunshine\ntole all right this is the fourth and\nfinal key point I decided that I want to\nbe at the front of the race as we enter\nthe new single\ntrack do you believe in those monsters\nI'm talking dreams so big that they\nhaunt you or they C you just how you\nknow if you got go and get it get to\nwinning I conquer I had to go out and\nget it without a sponsor kept it real\nnever crooked yeah that's honor now I\ncan go out and get it how I want to #\nbless\nI always on go feel like I'm never home\nit's song SW It's Time to Let It Go got\nme going dumb like I'm illiterate know\nyou feeling it I got you feeling this he\nR have you ever stayed up to the\nsunshine came through fourth quarter in\nthe CR time need to go fle on the just\none time have a fun\ntime know you feeling it I got you\nfeeling it\nknow you feeling it I got you feeling

so\nwhat you need I'm in the Earth Play My\nseas and I watch them grow till I say my\npeace know you feeling it I got you\nfeeling it Mar tell me do you believe in\nthose monsters I'm talking dreams so big\nthat they a Haun or they Cal you that's\nhow you know if you got to go and get it\nget to winning not conquer I had to go\nout and get it without a sponsor kept it\nreal never crook that's honor now I can\ngo out and get it how I want to # bless\nI all right we are through the single\ntrack I made three little mistakes in\nthere um that cost me three positions so\nI come out on the road in sixth position\nhowever Drew got a little confused used\nand tried to yell him to go straight so\nnow I'm in fifth here however I can see\nin front of me that there's one guy off\nthe front and then a group of three\nchasing him then I'm by myself um so I\ndon't really want to go one against\nthree I do look back and I see that Drew\nand yonas are pretty close so I decided\nto sit up a little bit and wait for them\nto uh kind of hammer it out with I try\nencourage them I'm like hey if we work\npretty strong we can catch on then then\nwe can sit for just a little bit while\nwe uh catch our breaths and then we'll\nbe in the lead group um however pretty\nquickly after the Motocross section I\ncould see that they were starting to\ntake a little bit lesser pulls and then\nstarted telling me that they couldn't\npull through just a little bit give me a\nlittle right there so I definitely had\nto do the line share of the work here\nand this cost me quite a bit of energy\nbut I knew I had to be in that group if\nI wanted a shot at a podium\nready to\nlose know\ntomorrow so\nmuch without\nyour Drew fell off the back of me and\nyonas was able to stay on my wheel and\nthen we caught up and became the lead\ngroup of six Riders this effort to get\nback on the lead Group after the single\ntrack took just under 22 minutes with an\naverage power of 293 normalized 306 in\ntotal from the end of the single track\nto the top of this false flat climb took\n53 minutes average power 278 with\nnormalized\n288 um the temperatures were definitely\nstarting to heat up and fatigue was for\nsure setting in\nhere in total this climb is just over 5\nm long and if you look at the profile\nit's super mellow until the last half\nmile where it kicks up brenen put in a\nnice kick and I fell off the back of the\ntop three Riders and I definitely have\nmy work cut out for me going down this\nnext downhill\nhere ready to lose your\nmind know tomorrow\nwe ready to\nL know tomorrow\nyou\nlose let's go go you got this water\nwater here we are mile 102 just about 5\nhours in approaching the canar BG climb\nright now we're actually just a group of\nfour so it's Carter Tasman Brendan and\nmyself after that last feed Zone Cody\nactually was still riding but pulled\nover the side and puking apparently he\nsomething he took from the feed Zone\njust didn't drive well with him and he\njust puked right back up so feeling\npretty secure in the top five which was\nmy for sure goal of the day hitting the\nbottom of the canberg climb it is 95° at\nthe base no wind whatsoever pretty\nquickly on though Brendan attacked and I\nhad known that he was definitely the\nstrongest guy in the race and knowing\nwhat this climb has and how hot it is I\ndidn't try and go with them I just kind\nof kept conservative from here Carter\nsurged ahead a bit I was hoping I could\nkind of stay with him but I just wanted\nto make sure I could get up this climb\nwithout cramping um Cody actually caught\nback up to us um but I was able to\ndistance him this climb took 20 minutes\nand 14 seconds for me to get up at an\naverage of 292 Watts yeah 5 hours in and\n95° this was just all I had in the tank\nover the top Brandon had put in a pretty\nsizable Gap Carter was the next guy over\nthe top top and I was sitting about 35\nseconds off him and then Cody was\nanother 35 seconds down on me so as far\nas the uh battle for the wind goes\nBrendan had a pretty good Gap but the\nbattle for uh second through fourth was\nuh pretty tight one here\nhere we are just at the end of the\nsingle track on a couple switchbacks I\ncan see that Cody is actually catching\nup to me so I decided to send it a\nlittle bit harder in hopes that I can\nget on the road by myself and maintain\nthe Gap that I have for third place\nI\nfor I go on forever chees and coffee\nstain somewhere in brok you made me\nyoung\nagain LS turning into change\nI don't one day all will\nchange all right I'm currently sitting\nin third place with a little bit of gap\non Cody with not much to go however I\nmake a pretty huge mistake here as I\nmiss a turn to go straight there was\nsome road construction going on and cars\nin the left lane and I totally missed\nthe sign right here that says to go\nstraight and curve right and and started\nheading to a neighborhood luckily I\nnoticed it right away on my map and knew\nthat something was off so I slowed down\nturned around didn't see the\nintersection so I was a bit confused on\nwhere I was supposed to go but as I was\ngetting back to the spot Cody went by\nand then I knew I'd be back on track I\nmiss that so join back up with him not\ngoing to lie I was super deflated here\nas I knew I had a really good shot of\nstaying away as I'm pretty powerful\nRider just on the flat roads\nunfortunately my GoPro dies shortly\nafter this here what happens is we're\ngoing down a little bit of a hill I mess\nup this turn going into the dirt section\nCody puts a bit of a gap on me and then\nwe proceed into the last off-road\nsection and there's some pretty gnarly\nwash outs he is completely sending it\nthrough there and putting more of a gap\non me in my head I'm thinking I've got\nfourth place locked up um third would be\namazing but I really don't want to mess\nthis up with the flat or anything so I\ntake it pretty conserv through this last\ndirt section hoping that I can reel Cody\nin on the way back into town however\nthere was a little bit of a leg as I got\nstuck behind a stoplight that he was\nable to make it through however he rode\npretty darn strong all the way to the\nfinish so I'm not sure if I would have\ncaught him regardless of the stoplight\nsituation I roll in here for fourth\nplace final spot on
