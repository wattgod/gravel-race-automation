        "explanation": "The new course blends 'smooth pavement with crunchy gravel' and is described as 'smoother and more approachable than ever.'

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Historical weather data shows average highs of 65°F and lows of 41°F, with a 64% chance of rain on any given day. July racing in the Canadian Rockies carries typical mountain weather unpredictability, though no historical weather incidents are documented. The 2026 move to June 7 might dodge peak summer storms but adds early season variables. More weather exposure than Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

      },
      "adventure": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Racing at the 'legendary Canmore Nordic Centre - the heart of the Rockies' delivers what organizers call 'the most stunningly brutal and beautiful day you'll have on two wheels all year.' Adventure earned by location, not technical terrain."
      },
      "prestige": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "This grassroots event caps at 250 riders with no cash purse and top 3 prizes only. The organizers' emphasis on 'no judgment, just high-fives at the finish' captures the recreational spirit perfectly."
      },
      "race_quality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "The 2026 format change to 4-hour unlimited laps suggests acknowledgment that the previous 5-lap structure needed improvement. Includes timing, aid stations, and finisher meal, but infrastructure feels basic for the venue."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "The setting delivers epic Rockies views and the format allows riders to 'throw in the towel whenever you're ready.' Mass start at 9 AM with flexible finish timing creates a social ride atmosphere more than racing intensity."
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Organizers describe the ethos as 'the struggle is our shared language, and everyone is invited to the conversation.' The 250-rider cap creates intimacy, though the field size limits the energy compared to larger events."
      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "With a field of 50-100 riders, no past winners, pro riders, or competitive field mentioned in any documentation. The 'no judgment' messaging and recreational bike welcome policy signals this is participation over competition throughout the field. Thinner field than Ouray Gravel Grinder."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Entry includes finisher tee, swag, nutrition stations, post-event meal, and results within 24 hours at the Canmore Nordic Centre venue. The organizers' accessibility focus and bike-agnostic approach maximize participation value."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Registration runs $75-100 CAD. Canmore's tourist season pricing affects lodging costs, and the venue requires travel to the Rockies for most riders. The race welcomes any bike type, potentially saving equipment costs for riders without gravel-specific setups. Higher total cost than Badlands."
