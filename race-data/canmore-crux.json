        "score": 3,

      "climate": {
        "score": 2,

      },
      "altitude": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Canmore Nordic Centre sits in the Bow Valley with meaningful elevation but nothing requiring acclimatization. High enough for Three Sisters mountain views, manageable enough for sea-level riders to suffer competitively."
      },
      "adventure": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Racing at the 'legendary Canmore Nordic Centre - the heart of the Rockies' delivers what organizers call 'the most stunningly brutal and beautiful day you'll have on two wheels all year.' Adventure earned by location, not technical terrain."
      },
      "prestige": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "This grassroots event caps at 250 riders with no cash purse and top 3 prizes only. The organizers' emphasis on 'no judgment, just high-fives at the finish' captures the recreational spirit perfectly."
      },
      "race_quality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "The 2026 format change to 4-hour unlimited laps suggests acknowledgment that the previous 5-lap structure needed improvement. Includes timing, aid stations, and finisher meal, but infrastructure feels basic for the venue."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "The setting delivers epic Rockies views and the format allows riders to 'throw in the towel whenever you're ready.' Mass start at 9 AM with flexible finish timing creates a social ride atmosphere more than racing intensity."
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Organizers describe the ethos as 'the struggle is our shared language, and everyone is invited to the conversation.' The 250-rider cap creates intimacy, though the field size limits the energy compared to larger events."
      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "No past winners, pro riders, or competitive field mentioned in any documentation. The 'no judgment' messaging and recreational bike welcome policy signals this is participation over competition throughout the field."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Entry includes finisher tee, swag, nutrition stations, post-event meal, and results within 24 hours at the Canmore Nordic Centre venue. The organizers' accessibility focus and bike-agnostic approach maximize participation value."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Canmore's tourist season pricing affects lodging costs, and the venue requires travel to the Rockies for most riders. The race welcomes any bike type, potentially saving equipment costs for riders without gravel-specific setups."
