        "explanation": "Romanian mountain weather swings unpredictably—the January Carpathian rally mentions icy forest roads on Comandaü plateau.

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Carpathian peaks stay under serious altitude thresholds through villages like Fundata and Fundatica—no oxygen debt drama here.

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Promoted as opportunity \"to join fellow enthusiasts like yourself\" with small group touring atmosphere. The @battistrada and @littlebigcycling8638 endorsement suggests niche following, but limited race reports indicate small, adventure-focused community rather than broad gravel racing participation."

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Tour format accommodates \"XC bicycles, Ebikes and gravel bikes\" suggesting mixed-ability participants rather than competitive field.
