        "explanation": "Padrones describes \"descending a gravel path at 65 km/h with some sharp corners\" but clarifies \"this was not a very technically demanding race\" with no singletrack or rocky sections. The 72% gravel surface prioritizes speed over technical skills, creating what riders call \"a fast course\" through Spanish fire roads. Less technical than The Mid South."

Padrones acknowledges the climbing load as \"a hard test\" befitting a World Series event, but the varied gradients spread the suffering across multiple ascents rather than one monster climb. Less climbing than The Mid South."

Padrones reports \"temperatures around the 15 degrees Celsius along the race itself\" with morning chill giving way to comfortable conditions.

        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Starting and finishing in Llucena keeps you at Mediterranean coastal elevations despite the mountainous terrain.

Lower altitude than Gravel Worlds — no thin-air concerns."

        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Racing through every corner of Llucena's municipal territory on 72% gravel roads delivers proper exploration of Spanish mountain terrain most cyclists never see.

February timing adds off-season adventure appeal when most European gravel racing shuts down."

Padrones praises \"flawlessly organised\" execution, though the event remains in its formative years."

        "explanation": "Small-town Spanish racing has that authentic feel where the entire municipality of Llucena gets involved, with the course literally visiting every corner of town.
