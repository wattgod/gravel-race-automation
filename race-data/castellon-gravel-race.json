        "explanation": "Padrones describes \"descending a gravel path at 65 km/h with some sharp corners\" but clarifies \"this was not a very technically demanding race\" with no singletrack or rocky sections. The 72% gravel surface prioritizes speed over technical skills, creating what riders call \"a fast course\" through Spanish fire roads. Less technical than The Mid South."

Padrones acknowledges the climbing load as \"a hard test\" befitting a World Series event, but the varied gradients spread the suffering across multiple ascents rather than one monster climb. Less climbing than The Mid South."

Padrones reports \"temperatures around the 15 degrees Celsius along the race itself\" with morning chill giving way to comfortable conditions.

        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Starting and finishing in Llucena keeps you at Mediterranean coastal elevations despite the mountainous terrain.

Lower altitude than Gravel Worlds — no thin-air concerns."

        "explanation": "Racing through every corner of Llucena's municipal territory on 72% gravel roads delivers proper exploration of Spanish mountain terrain most cyclists never see.

February timing adds off-season adventure appeal when most European gravel racing shuts down."

Padrones praises \"flawlessly organised\" execution, though the event remains in its formative years."

          "transcript": "I'm reporting all of you. Embarrassing.\n&gt;&gt; So, in this video, I'm going to be\ntalking about how to race gravel in\n20126, or how I'm going to be racing\ngravel in 2026. And maybe you can take\nsome inspiration from the things I've\nlearned from the four or five years that\nI've been racing gravel. And yeah, I'm\ngoing to talk about my calendar, my\nequipment, how I use my equipment, how\nyou can better yourself in a gravel\nevent, and some of the tips and tricks\nI've learned along the way. We are also\ngoing to do the Santa in Jirona. Santa\nis a two-day stage race here in Jirona.\nI live in Jirona, uh, and I have lived\nhere for some years now, and the\nweather's not looking too promising for\nthat race. So, I think it's going to be\nI think there's going to be some serious\ncarnage to come, but that'll be at the\nend of the video. And we'll put in some\npractice and see if my see if I can walk\nthe talk and see if any of the stuff\nthat I'm telling you will actually get\nyou to the end of a gravel event. Yeah.\nLet's lock in. Let's go. Okay. So, we're\ngoing to start off with the events that\nI'm doing in 2026.\nSo, the first event is obviously La\nSantal, which is this 2-day stage race,\nwhich we're doing this weekend. But the\nnext event on my calendar is the Strrada\nBianke Fonda. There's plenty of gravel.\nMost people do it on road bikes. You can\ndo it on a gravel bike. It doesn't\nreally matter. But that that's actually\njust a con. The Italians are so crazy.\nBut we're going to the Strider Bianke.\nThen we're going to be doing the Tracker\n200 this year. So looking forward to\nthat. That's another Jerona gravel race\nthat happens. We're going to be doing\nthe Grow in Scotland. We're then going\nto be going to Unbound. I'm going to be\ndoing the 200 mile in Unbound. Now that\nI've said it, we're going to be doing\nit. I'm going to head back to the UK and\nrace some crits in June, but then in\nJuly, we're doing the Maritana Doitri,\nwhich is a it's actually a Grand Fondo\nroad event, but uh with like a stupid\namount of elevation, but it should be a\ngood one to do. But then we're going to\nbe going to Iceland for the Rift. The\nRift is I've done it some years now. Is\na incredible gravel event. Like\ndefinitely the most unique environment\nto ride a gravel bike. I'm going to be\ndoing hamster gravel in Sweden. Yeah.\nAgain, another really, really beautiful\ngravel event. Like some of the most\npremium gravel you'll ride. Then I'm\ngoing to be racing a UCI in Thailand on\nthe 1st of November. And I think that\nwill probably round off the gravel\ncalendar for this year. Hopefully at the\nUCI GR I'll qualify for the Gravel World\nChampionships. The Gravel World\nChampionships are in Australia this\nyear. Whether or not I qualify is one\nthing, but whether I go or not is also\nanother one. But it would be cool to go\nto the Gravel World Championships. So,\nnow that I'm going to all of these\ngravel events, I mean, I'm going to need\nto go on some form of equipment. So, the\nequipment that I'll be using this year\nis so I'll be riding a Konago C68 gravel\nbike. I run full Shimano GRX Di2 at the\nmoment. With that, I'll be riding\nPirelli tires all year. These are some\nof the tires that I'll be running. So, I\ngenerally, as a rule of thumb, I like to\nride a 45 on the front. That's a 45 mil\nwidth. And that generally just gives me\na little bit more grip on the front\ntire. And then I run a slightly smaller\ntire on the back so I have slightly less\nrolling resistance. But I mean, what\nkind of tread you run really depends on\nthe conditions that you're going to be\ndealing with on the day. And so what\npressures to run in these tires? Well,\nthat also really depends on the weight,\nthe terrain that you're going to be\nriding on, the tire that you've got. And\nI'll leave a really useful website in\nthe description which you can put all\nthis information in and it will give you\nthe most optimal PSI to run your tires\nat and I something I use for almost all\nof my gravel events and yeah, it's a\nreal lifesaver. So definitely check that\none out because yeah, what tires and\nwhat tires pressure you run really makes\na massive difference on how easy it's\ngoing to feel to ride the bike or not.\nSo now you figured out what tires you're\ngoing to be running for the season or\nwhat tires you're going to be using in\nan event. you're probably going to need\nto learn or you're definitely going to\nneed to learn how to fix a puncher and\nwhat tools to bring on a gravel event.\nSo, this is my saddle bag, my trusty\nsaddle bag, and I'm going to show you\nwhat's inside my saddle bag. And I've\nhad this kind of saddle bag set up and\nit's been optimized over the years. I've\nbeen doing gravel, and I think I've got\nit pretty spot on. So, we'll go through\nthe essentials that I feel you need to\nbring. So, an electric mini pump. Now,\nthis has this has got me out of the\ntrenches quite a few times. There's\nmany, many different brands you can get.\nThis Asmax one has been pretty good to\nme as of recently. And that's going to\nhelp you pump up your tire if you get a\nflat. And if your tire won't go up, now\nyou need to use something like this.\nNow, this is a dino plug tool. Now, this\nif it hasn't been Oh, I've already used\nit. Okay, so I need to refill that. But\nthey both need refilling, but\nembarrassing. So, in a very, very dusty\nzy bag, I carry some spare plugs. That\nlittle nib here is going to go into the\ntire and that is going to be the thing\nthat like pops out and then that is\ngoing to be the thing that kind of makes\nthe area bigger. So, you need to be\nrunning tubeless tires with gravel and\nyou need to have sealant in them. This\nin combination with the plug that you've\ngot here will seal the puncher. And if\nit doesn't seal the puncher, then you're\ncooked. But I carry so many of these\nit'd be impossible not to fix this.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I paid for this. They didn't send\nme this and I've had this one for for\nmany many years and it has carried me\nout of some incredibly sticky\nsituations. So, 100% need one of these.\nThe next thing you're going to need is a\nCO2 canister. Now, we have got one pump,\nbut the CO2 canister with the CO2 head,\nas you can see, mine have definitely\nseen better days, but this combination\nis going to shoot air into the tire\nreally, really quickly. Now, why would\nyou need to shoot air into the tire\nreally, really quickly? Well, you might\nfind yourself in the situation where the\ntire has come off the bead, or you need\nto put air into the tire really, really\nquickly, and this does exactly that. So,\nthat will shoot the best part of 70 PSI\ninto a tire if you use the entire\ncanister. You don't have to use the\nentire thing, but I highly recommend\ncarrying one of these. And and actually,\nI just kind of leave it on like that.\nSometimes I actually put this in my back\npocket so I have this on the hand as\nquickly as possible. I have an Allen key\ntool here. This is for my seat post in\ncase my seat post comes undone. All the\ntools that you're going to need. Now\nyou've got all of this stuff with you.\nYou're probably figuring out how you're\ngoing to carry it all with you. So the\nsaddle bag is obviously essential, but I\nlike to have a few things on me. So I\nlike to use a jersey or a skin suit with\nlike pockets on the back. And I like to\nfill them mostly with my food on one\nside with the hand that's the easiest to\nreach. So for me, this is my right hand.\nand I use all my food there because\nthat's the thing I'm going to be\nreaching for the most. Then in the\nmiddle is my phone or camera depending\non what camera I'm using. Most of the\ntime it's my iPhone there. And then on\nmy left hand side is the tools that any\nof the like tools that I need to use or\nthe tools I need to reach for. And if I\ncan go through a gravel event and it be\nperfect, I won't even need to reach for\nmy tools. But so that's why that's on my\nhand that I least likely want to take\noff the handlebars. I run full Rafaire.\nI'm openly sponsored by by Rafer and\nthey've been great to me over the years.\nAnd yeah, I really like to run their\ncargo bibs. They're really really good\nif I need like even like a huge amount\nof food with me, but I also just like to\nrun their protein bibs. I really like to\nuse the Power Weave bibs that they have\nas well. So, of course, if you're riding\ngravel, you're going to need a helmet.\nAnd my helmet of choice is the Casp\nProton. Now, for me, this is probably\none of the most comfortable helmets on\nthe market. Again, I'm going to be\nwearing this thing for, you know, four\nto five to six to maybe even 10 hours\nthis year. So, it needs to be\ncomfortable. The These are my favorite\nOakleys. These are the Oakley encoders.\nBut yeah, this is my helmet glasses\ncombo of choice in this color. This one\nalso comes with a VC spec sticker. So,\ncoming soon, website in the description.\nSo for the like longer gravel races like\nUnbound for instance or the longer and\nhotter gravel races or if you've got\nnobody who can help you with like\nsupport in the aid stations which is\nperfectly normal and I feel like you\nknow you shouldn't need an army of\npeople to com compete and participate in\na gravel event and so uh one of the most\nasked questions most asked questions I\nget is what hydration vest do I use? So,\nuse a hydration vest because you need to\nstay hydrated. And politely, if you\ndon't stay hydrated, you're going to be\nin the trenches. The best hydration vest\nthat I have found, I have used quite a\nfew over the years, is this Salomon ADV\nskin hydration vest. Now, I've got a\nslight variation in this hydration vest,\nwhich I like to use, and I think is a\nmassive hack, especially in the really,\nreally hot temperatures. I mean,\nUnbound, you'll be racing in like 35°\nheat, maybe even more at times. This has\nreally really saved me. Now, this is a\nslightly thicker hose than normal and\nthis is actually a insulated bladder\nhose. Why would you use that? Well, I'll\nget to that in a second. The bladder\nhere as well, also insulated.\nWhy would you use an insulated bladder?\nWell, I actually like to freeze half of\nthe hydration vest before the day before\nthe event. I fill it up half with water\non the morning so that I basically have\nlike a solid block of ice in my\nhydration vest, but I still have water\nthat I can drink. Make sure that if you\nfreeze the water, freeze it horizontally\nso that you can put the water in the top\ncuz if you freeze it and like all the\nice is at the bottom and then you're not\ngoing to get like the water is not going\nto get cooled. And I use this so that I\ncan have really really cold water, you\nknow, for as long as possible. And that\nis where the insulated bladder comes in\nclutch because it basically just keeps\nit super super cool. I actually like to\nmix electrolytes in my hydration vest\nbecause the electrolytes I use are not\nsticky and so I can actually use this\nwater to cool myself down as well as\nkeep myself hydrated and keep my salts\ntopped up. So that is actually a huge\nhuge hack that I never really hear\nanybody talking about or sharing about.\nAnd I kind of figured that out from\ntrial and error and that's been a\nmassive lifesaver especially for me. I'm\na complete brick in the heat with this\none. You know, you've got a million\npockets in here if you want to carry\nextra gels, extra gels or extra bars.\nUm, you know, again, what what's your\ntactic going to be for the event? Are\nyou going to stop a few times and then\ntravel light or are you going to carry\neverything with you at the start? You\nknow, that all goes into the the tactics\nand and however you want to deploy\nyourself in the gravel events. That\nleads on to another point which I think\nis really good to talk about which is\nlike what tactics are you going to use\nto get from A to B in the fastest or the\nmost enjoyable way possible. So for me I\ngenerally like to ride with the fastest\npeople for as long as possible. Now I\nbasically ride with these people until I\ncan't ride with them anymore. And um I\njust think that this takes me further\ninto the event and you basically ride\nthe event in like a positive split. So,\nyou know, you do the first half much\nquicker than you do like the second\nhalf. And this has worked out really,\nreally well for me. I wouldn't say that\nthis is the most enjoyable way to do a\ngravel event because you feel absolutely\nruined on the second half. And honestly,\nthe a lot of these moments have have\nbroken me, but I do feel like for me\nthat is the quickest way for me to get\nfrom A to B. What is the most enjoyable\nway to do it? Well, actually, I think\nthe negative split is definitely the\nmost enjoyable way to do it. taking it\neasy for the first half of the event and\nthen starting to feel strong and ride\nstrong all the way to the finish. And I\ndon't think you get the most out of your\nbody that way, but I would say it's\ndefinitely a more enjoyable approach.\nWhat way will I be doing it this year?\nWell, I would like to see what my\nfitness is like when we start the Santa\nVal tomorrow and I will make a decision\non whether I want to do the positive\nsplit or the negative split. But those\nare the options I feel like you've got.\nIf you've got any more options or advice\non how to finish a gravel event, feel\nfree to put them in the comments. If you\nare finding this advice somewhat useful\nand you feel like this is going to help\nyou, then feel free to subscribe.\nDoesn't cost anything. So, where am I in\nmy fitness journey at the moment? Well,\nI will find out tomorrow. But where do I\nfeel I am? Well, I actually haven't done\nas much training as I have done last\nyear. And that is purely because my life\nis changing. You know, I've just moved\ninto a new apartment. This is probably a\nslightly different setting to what the\npeople who have watched my channel\nbefore have seen. And, you know, also my\npriorities have like slightly changed. I\nlove racing. I love riding. But, you\nknow, making content is the main part of\nmy job. And I've just been putting more\ntime towards doing that and and enjoying\nthe fruits of of life. I've got a you\nknow, if you haven't watched the last\nvideo, I've got a girlfriend now, Saza.\nShe also loves riding. And, you know, we\nspend a lot of time riding together. And\nso, the time to go and do four, five,\nsix hours with efforts just isn't there\nanymore. And as I just said, filming and\nmaking content is the main part of my\njob. And if you're wondering how I film\na gravel event, these are the cameras I\nuse. Firstly, the most like useful\ncamera I use is definitely the Insta\n360. This is the X5. They've just got an\nX5 Air, I believe, which is like a\nlighter lighter model. And I like to use\nthis but with a cage. So I use like a\nGoPro to like a thread adapter here. So,\nthat I found is the most like solid\nsolid attachment for the handlebar. And\nyou can just, you know, if you haven't\nseen the Insta 360 footage, I'll insert\nsome here.\n&gt;&gt; But you can just capture absolutely\neverything. And for the start of the\nevents, um, where you need to keep your\nhands on the handlebars, this, I feel,\nis actually the only option to be using\nat this moment in time. It's definitely\nnot the most like cinematic camera in\nthe world, but it allows you to capture\neverything and keep your hands on the\nbars. The other camera I like to use,\nwhich almost everybody should have or\nwill know of, is a iPhone. So, this is\nthe iPhone 16 Pro. And I like to shoot\nin the Apple ProRes on here. This gives\nyou some more options when it comes to\ncolor grading. I'm going to carry this\nanyway when I'm cycling cuz if I get\nstuck in the middle of nowhere because\nmy tires left the track or I've crashed\nreally badly, I can contact somebody on\nmy phone. This is also like an\nincredibly incredibly powerful camera\nand this should not be underestimated.\nThe other camera that I will actually be\nusing and experimenting with is the DJI\nOsmo Action 4. So I for an action camera\nat the moment and the quality of the\nimage that comes out and the quality of\nthe colors that come out of this camera,\nI think for €180, this was a complete\nsteal. and I'm filming on it right now.\nSo, all the footage you're seeing right\nnow is filmed on a DJI Osmo Action. And\nthis is the in-built microphone. This is\nthe setup we're going to be trying to go\nwith. So, we're going to be using the\niPhone, the DJI Osmo Action 4, and the\nInsta 360 to record the Lassanta, which\nwe will get to at the end of this video.\nSo, if you would like to take the sport\nof gravel a little bit further and\nqualify for the Gravel World\nChampionships, this is how you're going\nto do it. So, you're going to want to go\nto the UCI Gravel calendar and you want\nto look at the UCI qualifiers. Now,\nthese are qualifier events for the\nGravel World Championships. And to\nChampionships, you need to finish in the\ntop 25% of your age category. Honestly,\nthe Gravel World Championships, I've\ndone it two years in a row now, is a\nreally amazing experience with all the\ncrowds and the amount of people that\nparticipate. It's really, really\nsomething special. It's obviously closed\nroads and if you get the chance to\nqualify, you should 100% take the\nopportunity and go to the Gravela World\nChampionships. Now, I think I've covered\neverything in my approach to gravel\nracing in 2026. Uh, we've got two days\nahead of the Laanta, the two-day stage\nrace in Jirona. I'll be putting all the\nnonsense I've just been talking about\ninto play at this event. And this year,\nso stay locked and enjoy the Santa Val.\nI think the course is going to be\ncomplete carnage cuz it's still raining.\nIt is the morning of the Santa Val stage\none. We are on our way. Two bagels with\negg and chares got inhaled for breakfast\nand that is uh that is the diet for\ntoday's 120 km. Don't need to drive to\nthis race because if you're in Jerona,\nit's really really near. It's just my\ncar was parked in a spot where I had to\nmove it. We're going to head to the\nrace. We're going to sign on and we're\ngoing to get busy.\n&gt;&gt; I approve of this exposure.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, this is good. This is good. Okay.\nThree, two, come on.\nWonder\nwonder\n&gt;&gt; things we love to see. Huh?\nWe're an hour into the sandal and my\nlegs, my heart's been in my mouth pretty\nmuch the entire time. And there's one\ngood reason for that. We'll take one\nlook at my last week of training and\nthere we go. That's the reason.\nOtherwise, I'm actually having a blast.\n&gt;&gt; Oh, hey.\n&gt;&gt; How are you, man?\n&gt;&gt; I'm good, bro.\n&gt;&gt; I thought you would be up there.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, me too.\n&gt;&gt; Me, too. But my legs said no. Great to\nsee you, man.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, good to see you.\n&gt;&gt; Current situation.\nTrenches.\nAh, when I describe the trenches, this\nis what I describe.\n&gt;&gt; Let's go.\n&gt;&gt; Do not fall. You are on camera.\nAh,\n&gt;&gt; you can't park there, man.\nThat, my ladies and gentlemen, is the\ntrenches. Reporting all of you. I'm\nreporting all of you to Gerard.\nIn these kind of conditions, it's\nactually just better just to ride in the\ngrass. Mate, I can't do that.\nNo. Go on.\nSaza. Saza would be proud.\n1 hour 52 minutes into stage one. I may\nhave completely and knowingly cooked the\nprep for this event, but the thing I\ngenuinely cooked on was this tire setup.\nOh my god, the grip. The grip level is\ninsane. 5 gravel M on the front. Its\nback hurts more than mine for carrying\ncarrying the grip of this bike.\nOutrageous.\nWe got a good wind buffer here for the\nfor the flat section.\nYeah,\nlot most of the climbing kind of done\nnow and yeah, we're going to press on.\nFeeling not incredible, but that's kind\nof been the aim of the game all day\nreally.\n&gt;&gt; Jess, are you\n&gt;&gt; He wouldn't let me do it. That's usually\nlike a cheeky shortcut that you can\ntake.\nAnd then we come to this.\n20k to go. We're a bit in the trenches,\nbut\nokay. The situation is we're 15ks ago.\nThere's six of us. And I think there's a\nDane, an Italian, an American, and\nuh this guy, this guy could be Spanish,\nand the other guy, I don't know, he can\nbe countryless. I'm the protected rider\nas you can see.\nBut yeah, the American really, really\nwants to win. I can tell. The Dane is\nthe dark horse. He's been a bit yo-yo\noff the back. Spanish and the\ncountryless. I don't I don't think\nthey've got minerals. One of them's got\na mechanical. Anyway, we'll lock in.\nThis guy's got a rain jacket on, so my\nmoney's definitely not on him. He's\ngoing to overheat. The bike sounds\namazing.\nI am a bit cooked. Insta 360 left the\nchat today. So, we've just got this\nfootage to clean this bastard.\nAnd just like that, she's ready to go.\n&gt;&gt; Jesse, are you ringing your mind?\nfeel.\nHey. Hey. Hey.\nOh, it was all going so good.\nOh yo,\n&gt;&gt; I've completely twatted my room and I\nthink my room is done.\n&gt;&gt; Keep this on me for the moment.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] the tire on a rock.\n&gt;&gt; Oh, really? And you're done?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, my carpet is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]\n&gt;&gt; This is This is not staying up. This is\ndone. Yeah, I'm also done. Thanks for\ncoming. Santal stage two.\n&gt;&gt; 5.2. 5.2 km. Thanks for coming.\n&gt;&gt; Ah, it is what it is. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] happens, you\nknow. This is just gravel racing.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, this is trenches. Exactly.\n&gt;&gt; This was the best 5 km I've ever done.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I actually say it was about 5 km\ntoo long. Good ride today, mate. This\nman can keep us company for today.\n&gt;&gt; What's happened here, mate? Uh well, we\njust thought it was about 5k too long to\nrepair.\n&gt;&gt; I forgot to put air in today. Rookie\nmistake.\n&gt;&gt; Oh,\n&gt;&gt; I completely cracked my rim and it won't\nhold any air. Won't hold any more air\nthan that. What else is there to do it\nat this at this moment in time?\n&gt;&gt; Those things.\n&gt;&gt; This was the back wheel I actually\nneeded, but unfortunately I didn't have.\n&gt;&gt; Can I get you over?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you actually can.\nOh Jesus.\n&gt;&gt; Nice one.\n&gt;&gt; Go television.\n&gt;&gt; Television.\n&gt;&gt; How was that?\n&gt;&gt; Pretty broken. But uh yeah,\nwe I was already broken from yesterday\nand now it's good, man.",

decided to come and do one of the\nUCI\nraces here's\nour telling me it look bad it's bad and\nI'm yeah I'm super excited to be here\nthe course is so up my street like it's\nliterally just climbing and descending\nand I love climbing I've got so much\nhappier descending with my new bike so I\nthink I'm going to love it although I\nthink I'm also going to hate it cuz it's\n3,000 M of climbing in under 100K so\nit's going to be so so hard so hard but\nwhatever happens I think it's going to\nbe a success to get round\n[Music]\nall good trip have class\non hello ladies where are we going\nhi a gravel race to a gravel race on the\nway to casson for a gravel race um I'm\nhere with Sarah hi and\nSophia an\nemail and we're going on a little road\ntrip\nMH girls show them the tri girls trip\nshow them what show okay this is the car\nthat we've got okay this this is not the\ncar we\nordered it's the car we deserve this is\nthe car we deserve how does it drive\nsevia really great we've not stored ever\nnever we didn't miss three rounds at one\nred L because of stalling never so we\nare on our way to do the first UCI\ngravel race of the Year we're excited\nwoo\nwoo okay we have arrived a video for you\nguys later we are we made it we made\nit who drove Sophia drove Sophia\nI've come for a walk to the beach this\nmorning to talk you through my bike\nsetup for this race so I've obviously\ngot new bikes this year I'm sponsored by\nL cycles for the two the next two years\nI'm absolutely like thrilled to bits\nwith this bike and yeah I've got another\none at home with a rigid Fork but this\none has a suspension Fork but more on\nthat in a minute and basically I'm just\ngoing to decide based on the race which\nbike I want to ride but let me tell you\nthis bike has changed the game for me\nlike I'm so so happy when I'm riding\nthis bike and I just love riding it it's\nso much fun and I think my descending\nhas improved like no end so I don't know\nwhen I'm going to need the rigid Fork\nmaybe when I want to save a bit of\nweight I say that and this is a really\nreally heavy race but I think the time\nI'm going to save on The Descent with\nthe suspension Fork is going to be worth\nit I'm just going to go and get my bike\nand talk through my setup for this race\nhere we have the beauty I actually\nhaven't named her yet so if you want to\ngive it a name\nthen whip a name suggestion in the\ncomments I went for the snowy the glossy\nwhite um I don't remember what the\nofficial name is for this color but I\nlove it it's gorgeous the only thing is\nif it gets dirty it's quite obvious so\nthis is the LF sagler and just in case I\nforget the name the name is there so\nthis is a l sagler and I ride an extra\nsmall frame and I'm 5'7 so that's\nactually a really small frame but I've\nhad a bike for recently and it's\nconfirmed that that's the right frame\nsize for me I've got very long legs and\na very short torso so that's what works\nfor me so what I'm running so we've got\nthis suspension vog which is the thing\nthat's very unique about the L bikes is\nthey have this suspension fork and it\njust absolutely changes the game for\noff-road riding like I feel so much more\nconfident on descent I'm so much faster\nit's more comfortable we're riding e13\nWheels which are the ones that come with\nthe laugh and we've got Shram red group\nset um which is a amazing like the new\nShram red 13-speed so L asked me like\nwhat I wanted in terms of setup and like\nI've set up my two bikes differently and\nI'll go through the other bike when I\nrace that but this bike I've decided to\nput a mountain bike cassette on it\nbecause this is going to be my my my\nrace bike for like the really technical\nrougher races so I want as much of a\ngear range as possible really so here it\nis and honestly it's amazing and we've\nalso got dual um dual sided power cranks\nwhich is just super helpful for me\ntraining and then I've got I just put\nthese bottle cages on myself um I really\nlike these ones they're like pretty\ncheap and I've never had a problem\nthey've never broken and I've also set\nup a diner plug here for emergency\nrepairs so apidura gave me this tool bag\nhere and I've just popped that on with\nmy emergency\nsupplies and then one of the key things\nfor gravel is what tires are we running\nso similar to last year we've got the\ngravel King x1's I'm riding a 40 right\nnow I actually am going to upsize to a\n45 um for my next race but for now I'm\nriding 40 it's was just what was on what\nI set up initially and I was happy with\nthat what else is there to tell you\nabout oh my new bike computer okay so\nthis is the koros dura um and it's super\ncool and I've been using this for a\nwhile and I say the coolest thing about\nthis is like I've literally charged it\nlike three times in my life and it's on\n79% right now but like every time I ride\nit has solar charging so sometimes I'm\nlike net positive if I go for a long\nenough ride um but yeah it's got\ndifferent modes and I just love the spit\nsplit screen element so I can basically\nturn the split screen on and off which\nmeans that my screen shows me like a lot\nmore data and I can choose a lot more\ndata points to be able to watch during\nriding which I I need when I'm training\nand I need like power data heart rate\ndata I also customize this with Road l\nRoad bars rather than gravel bars and\nthat's cuz personally I just don't\nreally I'm not really into a flare bar\nthe bars are 38 and this stem is 90 I'm\nactually going to change it to a 70 stem\nI've ordered some 70 stems after a\nrecent bike fit and I'm going to take\nthe bike down a little bit I'm going to\ndrop it a little bit and by 20 mil and\nthen bring the stem in by 20 mil as well\nand then in terms of saddles I'm with\ncell Italia again this year and this is\nthe gravel saddle um and I just yeah I'm\nreally happy with the Saddles pedals I'm\njust running Shimano pedals last year I\nwas running Garmin rally pedals for\npower but I don't need them anymore and\nI actually quite like having lighter\npedals and having power cranks instead\nbut yeah that's my new bike and here is\nthe bike from the front you can see how\nmuch clearance I've got like I could\nliterally put 50 I could put mountain\nbike tires on this bike if I wanted to\nI'm feeling like really positive going\ninto this race super excited um to get\nracing again I just I love this carrent\nlife I'm\nliving hello and welcome to day two of\ngirls trip being car yeah us being in\nthis car we're going to found how to\nthat youen today to wack you the course\nthat was a good pronunciation\nwhat do we think of the course guys um\nso the winning average speed last year\nwas 21 km per hour I think that says\neverything and we were like was this a\nmistake and then we like found the straa\nto check and we've seen people wreck it\nrecently and what speed have they been\ndoing 16 14 dad speed so we've changed\nwhat our plan was today we were going to\nwrecky the whole course 97k cuz we\nthought we could do that in four or five\nhours but I don't think we can no so\nwe're going to do\n75k super excited to check out this\ncourse it's going to be crazy we can see\nlots of other cyclists doing exactly the\nsame thing so clearly today is wcky day\nthere's several people in L with cars\nand bikes okay we've arrived in us deid\nlet me get the backdrop it is beautiful\nhere and it looks really hilly so I can\nsee why the course is hilly and we're\ngoing to go racky part of the\ncourse Sarah what just happened I\naccidentally put on Wheel on\nmy what do we think you know Sarah Knows\na Lot About Tires\nshe saw she saw plli and that was the\ndecision

race and see how I feel um\njust packing up the\ncar Glamorous Life good morning oh it's\nbright good\nmorning glamour it is a beautiful\nsunrise here in\nLua what are these moves this is The\npre-race Vibes are we prepping for\ngravel r or to go on a night out I'd\nrather go on a night out honestly is\nprobably how we feeling mie\nthat was really cool\nyeah that was awesome we RI the band\nladies and gentlemen the bandaid is off\nwe raced we littered it out there the\nbandaid only a Ra Skin right now okay\ncarb count 380 so 120 of my bottles plus\n260 here 380 for 4 and 1/2 hours that's\nokay could have done better could have\ndone a better job look at this beautiful\nTown breakfast I can't we were like up\non these things like on these plateaus\nand then there's like other towns you\nknow know what that was one of my\nfavorite race courses I actually think\nthat too it was so cool yeah it was so\nbeautiful it was so hard but I think it\nwas one of my favorites I agree okay\nwe're in the car sorry Sophia's having a\nlittle bit of Ro\nrage doing 10 km an hour it's like he\nwants me to stall that would be so\nembarrassing dude\noh the car post\nrace we went to the Past party um\nit was good I think this was a fun race\nit was a good first race of the year for\nsure it was so well organized honestly I\nwas really impressed you know what I was\nreally impressed with how many people\nthere were on like any dangerous corner\nlike when it was actually dangerous\nthere was always someone sing you down\nyeah that's true and then when it wasn't\nreally dangerous there was just like a\nsign that was like this is kind of\ndangerous and then like medium danger\nwere actually so many signs saying\ndangerous turns and it got to a point\nwhere I was like oh like surely not and\nthen I was like no I think every turn\nwas a dangerous turn well that's how\nthey thought it they were either like\ndangerous descent or dangerous turn but\nthen if you saw the\noh SI\nsick good morning from London I'm\nliterally about to leave to go to mares\nMorocco for my next race but it is 7:00\na.m. and I haven't managed to do a\nlittle race report for this for the race\non the weekend the C on gravel race so I\nthought I'd do a little race report here\nso C on gravel race started and it was\nbasically all the women started together\nand we started on the road and it was a\npretty fast Road descent to be honest\nnot how you want to start a race and\nthen we hit first bit of gravel which\nkind of separated us out and I think I\nwas I was in the front group at that\npoint and there was seven of us I'm\npretty certain there was seven and then\nwe hit a climb and hit the climb with\nthe front group and I was like yes I've\nmade the front group and we're on this\nclimb and we're maybe like 10 minutes\ninto the climb and I looked down at my\npower and I kind of just spooked myself\nout I was pushing like 300 WTS and I\nknow how long I can do 300 watts for and\nthinking that there's a 3,000 M amount\nof climbing total for the race to do I\nwas like maybe this isn't insensible on\nreflection maybe I should have kept at\nit because actually looking at St\nsegments later on in the race I was\ndoing the longer steeper climbs at the\nsame Pace as the girls at the front just\non my own so I feel like I maybe\nshouldn't have done the technique I did\nbut I really wanted to just kind of get\nround confidently for this race so I\nbasically tted it the rest of race so I\nlike let them go on the climb and then I\nwas like right I'm just going to do my\nPace because I I thought I think I was\nmore confident that people would crack\nthan maybe they did crack I think I mve\nforward five positions so a couple of\ngoals two girls over took me on that\nclimb and then I ended up coming fifth\nso I think I move forward about five\npositions and I basically just like Took\nThe Descent safely but relatively fastly\num is that a word I don't know and then\nthe climbs I just kind of like pushed\nwhat power I knew I could do and just\nkeep doing all day on the climbs if that\nmakes sense and I didn't know where I\nwas in the race like I kind of counted\nhow many girls are in front of me but\nyou also can't really tell because the\n40-year-old men came through when we hit\nthat climb so like they picked up some\nwomen and I couldn't really tell if\npeople were men or women from behind so\nI was like oh I don't really know like\nhow many people in front but I just kept\npushing and I really enjoyed it it was\nlike such a fun race and I have to say\norganization was incred inredible every\nsingle slightly dangerous thing had a\nsign and someone there it was more\ndangerous than slightly and like\neveryone was riding really safely the\natmosphere was amazing like you'd be in\nthe middle of nowhere and there'd be\nsome random locals just cheering you on\nwhich was so cool and I did ride with a\nfew guys a couple of times like I had\npeople to ride with I didn't really ride\nwith many women much because we started\nyeah just a little bit in front of like\ntumors in front of the 40-year-old men\n40-year-old men are quite fast or they\ncan be so I'm not sure who who planned\non that ordering thinking that they\nwouldn't catch us really hope I get to\ndo again next year I don't know if I\nwill because my season's finishing in\nlike November and I don't think I'll be\nready to go again in Feb but I\nabsolutely loved it and 100% would do it\nnext year if I'm racing that soon maybe\nI'll just go for for like a fun training\nrace guys where are you going I want to\ngo to the\npizeria you like going spy\nof Valencia and I'm going to say it's a\nbit better I think it's better look at\nthe I don't think we can get the view\nthere was ruins down there it's gorgeous\nwe're riding for the of Valencia\naction okay what do we think about the\nblue I think the blue is perfect cuz\nwe've also got hold on one second so\nwe've also got this blue and purple kind\nof contrast oh I kind of like the\ncontrast yeah so do I but but this one's\nlighter it's it's like thinner oh yeah\nand I think it's going to be hot it was\npretty hot today wasn't it it was pretty\nhot today so I think I'm going to do\nmesh okay go for mesh okay rather than\nstyle I would go for style\npersonally I would definitely go for\nstyle I know but MD is about performance\nSophia what you doing um going to as\nmanyi carbs in his\npossible every bite I take is one watt\nfaster I agree",
