No notable past winners in the research, no pro field depth, just grassroots Michigan racing. The fact they need a minimum 10 racers per category tells you everything about the draw power."
      },
      "race_quality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Cedar Blitz delivers basic race infrastructure with aid stations, timing, and medical support for shorter distances, but the 130-mile ultra goes unsupported and unmarked. They'll race in 'rain, snow, sleet, or shine' which sounds tough until you realize it's more about limited cancellation policies than epic conditions. The course is described as 'fast and rowdy' but details are thin as Michigan topsoil."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Post-race festival with live music, food trucks, and craft beer at Cedar Springs Brewing Co. sounds decent enough for small-town gravel racing. The 'electric mix' of community support creates atmosphere, but you're still in Cedar Springs, Michigan — not exactly a destination that'll change your life. Four distance options mean everyone gets their participation trophy."
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Strong local support from families and teams, plus the race benefits Cedar Springs Music Boosters and World Bicycle Relief through the ultra distance. Starting and finishing at Cedar Springs Brewing Co. downtown creates a proper town square vibe. The 'grassroots charm' isn't marketing speak here — it's genuine small-town Michigan embracing cyclists."
      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Minimum 10 racers per category with race directors allowed to combine undersubscribed fields — that's not competitive depth, that's survival mode. No mention of notable winners or pro participation suggests the fastest riders are probably strong local club racers. This is participatory gravel racing, not gladiatorial combat."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Four distance options from 18 to 130 miles, aid stations, timing, medical support, and a post-race festival with beer and food trucks delivers solid bang for your buck. Cash prizes sponsored through the Michigan series add incentive beyond just finishing. Small-town pricing typically beats big-event gouging, though specific entry fees weren't available."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Cedar Springs location keeps costs reasonable — Holiday Inn lodging mentioned suggests standard chain pricing, not resort rates. No airport details available but you're probably driving to rural Michigan anyway. Downtown start/finish at the brewery means walkable post-race logistics without expensive shuttles or remote venues."
      },
      "length": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Four distance options hit the sweet spots: 18-mile beginner, 36-mile short, 50-mile standard, and 130-mile ultra for the masochists. The 62-mile distance mentioned in scoring doesn't match official offerings, but 50-mile 'long/endurance/advanced' category covers serious gravel territory. Time limits are reasonable at 4 hours for shorter distances, 10 hours for the ultra."
      },
      "technicality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Mix of gravel, dirt, and rural roads through rolling hills and forest-lined lanes sounds pleasantly varied but not technically demanding. Described as 'fast' courses suggest flow over technical challenge. Michigan terrain rarely delivers rock gardens or Alpine switchbacks — expect farmland rollers and hardpack through trees."
      },
      "elevation": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Rolling hills mentioned but no specific elevation profiles available beyond user-provided 3000 feet over 62 miles. Michigan's glacial terrain delivers plenty of punchy climbs but nothing sustained or mountainous. Cedar Springs area offers legitimate elevation changes for the Midwest without being genuinely mountainous."
      },
      "climate": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "July in Michigan means heat, humidity, and potential thunderstorms — they'll postpone for lightning but race through most weather. 'Rain, snow, sleet, or shine' policy in July suggests they've seen freak weather events. Summer heat with Midwest humidity creates legitimate suffer conditions without altitude or desert extremes."
      },
      "altitude": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Cedar Springs, Michigan sits at standard Midwest elevation — probably under 1000 feet above sea level. No altitude training benefits, no thin air challenges, just standard Great Lakes region topography. Your biggest breathing challenge will be humidity, not oxygen deprivation."
      },
      "logistics": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Downtown Cedar Springs start/finish at the brewery creates centralized logistics with post-race festivities walkable from the venue. Holiday Inn lodging option suggests adequate accommodations. Missing details on parking and packet pickup, but small-town events typically handle basics competently without big-city complications."
      },
      "adventure": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "The 130-mile ultra offers genuine adventure with GPS navigation, mandatory lights, and complete self-support through unmarked terrain. Shorter distances stick to well-marked routes with full support — safe but predictable. Rural Michigan gravel through forests and farmland provides pleasant scenery without epic wilderness remoteness."
