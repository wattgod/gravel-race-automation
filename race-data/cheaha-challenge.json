The Time Trial starts in Piedmont and finishes in Jacksonville with no transport provided back to your car.

The century route hits 9,714 feet including Mount Cheaha twice, with named climbs like \"OH SHIFT!\" and \"Not Again\" that locals designed because they \"knew all aspects of Cheaha Mountain.\" Starting from Jacksonville at 650 feet and summiting Alabama's highest peak at 2,407 feet makes every climb count."

        "explanation": "Mount Cheaha at 2,407 feet is Alabama's highest point, starting from Jacksonville at 650 feet elevation. The 1,757-foot climb is substantial for the region but barely registers for altitude effects. This is sea-level suffering with hills, not mountain adaptation territory."

        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Mike Vickers founded this event with \"a challenging bicycle ride up Cheaha Mountain,\" and colleagues' response was \"Who in the world would want to do that?\" The route follows Skyline Drive through \"forested hills\" that \"open onto vast overlooks\" across Talladega National Forest, summiting Alabama's highest peak twice on longer routes. Local course designers included climbs that \"had to be there\" rather than safe, predictable routes."

Top 25% finishers qualify for UCI Worlds, and it's rated one of the \"Best Road Cycling Events in Southeast\" by Strambecco. The growth from 80 Time Trial registrants in 2019 to 154 in 2021 indicates momentum, but it remains primarily a Southeast regional gran fondo rather than national destination."

However, Nadia Pavlova's comment that \"everything was canceled; I couldn't even plan anything\" reflects the challenges of smaller regional events maintaining consistent quality."

Rest stops get creative — \"one year there was one with a Tour de France theme complete with the famous Tour devil, a small Eiffel Tower and even two pretty podium girls.\" ULTRA finishers get custom shirts while non-finishers \"will receive the ashes of their burned shirts\" — a motivational touch that sticks with you."

Emma Drabbe took women's honors in 4:52:25, down from Lisa Houser's 5:07:48 the previous year. UCI qualifier status brings some depth — top 25% qualify for Worlds — but with only overall awards for century and ULTRA winners, the competitive structure remains basic for a 1,000-rider field."

        "score": 3,

The package includes free pre-ride breakfast at JSU, professional timing, medical support, and post-ride buffet by Cooter's Rib Shack. Pre-ride party at $15 and \"undoubtedly one of the best-supported century rides anywhere\" with creative rest stops delivers solid bang for buck in Alabama cycling."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Jacksonville, Alabama isn't breaking any budgets — local dining includes \"award-winning barbeque restaurants\" and the town's 12,548 population keeps lodging affordable. Essential gear includes hydration packs since \"hydration points are limited along the route,\" but that's smart preparation rather than forced expense. The Time Trial's Piedmont-to-Jacksonville route requires transport arrangement back to your car, more logistical hassle than major expense."
