        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Jenna Rinehart notes this was 'the first time they started the women's field separately from the men,' highlighting how organizers adjust logistics but create new complications. The lottery system requiring March 15 entry and six-month Life Time memberships for priority access remains unnecessarily complex. Point-to-point logistics mean dealing with shuttles between Hayward and Cable, though 43 years of experience shows in race execution."
      },
      "length": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "The race is characterized as 'one long all-out effort for the entire 40 miles' rather than a distance challenge. Elite women like Rinehart and Rollins work together for the first half before separating, while the constant rollers mean leaders finish in roughly two hours. For riders seeking endurance challenges, this feels more like an extended criterium. More compact than Grinduro. As Alexey Vermeulen puts it: \"I started trying to make my moves with around seven miles to go. I could see the group was splintering, and guys were chasing to regain contact, and I knew the rubber band would eventually snap and ga...\""
      },
      "technicality": {
        "score": 5,
        "explanation": "The course contains 'NO technical singletrack whatsoever' but scores maximum for tactical complexity with 2,100 riders funneling through narrow sections. Rinehart's crash came when her 'front tire slipped out on a rut' with 1.5 miles remaining, while Hall suffered a flat when a 'sharp rock slashed a gaping hole in sidewall.' The Birkie Trail's width creates bottlenecks that end races instantly. Among the most technical in gravel, on par with Badlands. As Ruth Holcomb puts it: \"At almost every other race, you climb up a big hill, then you go down the descent and you get to rest down the descent. While the hill is hard, you get full recovery.\""
      },
      "elevation": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Rinehart's strategy reveals the elevation challenge: 'I rode at a firm effort knowing that while Fire Tower is hard the race gets even harder when you hit the Birkie trail after that.' The course delivers 61.4 feet of climbing per mile through 'constant punchy rollers' and 'leg burning rollers near the end.' Fire Tower at mile 25-30 is where 'the race blows up' according to multiple elite riders. Similar elevation profile to Gravel Worlds. As Ruth Holcomb puts it: \"At almost every other race, you climb up a big hill, then you go down the descent and you get to rest down the descent. While the hill is hard, you get full recovery.\""
      },
      "climate": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Historical weather data shows average highs of 70°F and lows of 54°F, with a 40% chance of rain on any given day. September weather creates equipment gambles, as Hall discovered when a sharp rock punctured his tire during prime racing conditions. Richards called September 'one of the best ever' with perfect temps and moisture, but the month averages 31% chance of rain. When conditions turn, the wide Birkie Trail becomes treacherous enough to cause crashes in the final miles. More weather exposure than Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."
      },
      "altitude": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Cable, Wisconsin sits at minimal elevation with zero physiological challenge from thin air. The only elevation mentions in rider reports refer to climbing effort, not altitude adaptation. This is pure Midwest terrain offering no acclimatization benefit or altitude training value. Lower altitude than Gravel Worlds — no thin-air concerns."
      },
      "adventure": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "The point-to-point route travels through Chequamegon National Forest on trails accessible only race day, creating exclusivity beyond typical loop courses. The course follows the American Birkebeiner Ski Trail through 'fast flowing and wide grassy cuts through the forest' before hitting forest roads and snowmobile routes. Fall conditions and Northwoods terrain provide adventure backdrop, though the wide trail prevents backcountry isolation."
      },
      "prestige": {
        "score": 5,
        "explanation": "Elite riders like Vermeulen treat this as a marquee win, with his 2025 victory marking his third Chequamegon title. Rinehart's comment about her '11th Chequamegon race' shows how veterans return year after year. The Life Time Grand Prix Series integration means top cyclists like Rollins and Olshove line up in Cable, while the lottery system exists because demand crushes supply among serious racers."

        "score": 5,
        "explanation": "Vermeulen's tactical awareness—'I could see the group was splintering, and guys were chasing to regain contact, and I knew the rubber band would eventually snap'—shows the race rewards strategic racing despite the power focus. The 2025 course change separating pro and mass fields 'allowed for additional space with passing' while maintaining competitive integrity through technical final sections."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 5,
        "explanation": "The race creates memorable moments from start to finish, with Rinehart's crash 1.5 miles from the line epitomizing the drama: 'I got back up as quickly as possible but was feeling discouraged...I started to pedal a bit more and rounded a corner and realized I could still see Melisa up ahead.' The point-to-point journey from downtown Hayward through national forest to Telemark Resort delivers a complete racing narrative."
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 5,
        "explanation": "The event creates 'a full-on celebration of mountain biking' where 'Hayward and Cable rally around the event with cheering crowds and strong volunteer presence.' Starting at 10am means 'riders come in hot in a short time frame and the party escalates quickly.' The festival atmosphere includes music, expo, and vendors, while organizers maintain family focus with free Little Loggers races. As Pirates and Fun puts it: \"The party in the Northwoods saw pirates offering rum hand-ups on the trails, contributing to the atmosphere.\""

        "explanation": "With a field of 3,000+ riders (one of largest MTB races in USA), rollins noted staying patient with 'a pretty big group coming through the first feed zone' before the race exploded at Fire Tower, while Hall described 'a large pack the first half of the race' among elite riders. Vermeulen's winning move came from recognizing when 'anybody who got on my wheel wasn't willing to work,' showing depth that creates tactical complexity even on the Birkie Trail. Elite-level competition, on par with Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego. As Melisa Rollins puts it: \"We were a pretty big group coming through the first feed zone and I tried to stay patient. The race blew up at mile 25 on the Firetower climb and I was feeling really good.\""
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "The $120 entry provides access to exclusive terrain and a festival experience that includes live music, expo, and vendors at the Great Hall finish. Free Little Loggers races show family commitment beyond profit extraction. The lottery system exists because the experience delivers value that creates overwhelming demand among the mountain bike community."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Registration runs $100-$150. Cable and Hayward require resort-area lodging during peak fall foliage season, with accommodations booking months in advance. The point-to-point format requires shuttle logistics or two-car coordination that loop races avoid. However, Wisconsin pricing beats European race destinations, and the Northwoods offers value compared to mountain town resort pricing during race weekend. Similar expense level to Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

      "should_you_race": "Show up fit or don't show up at all—the Seeley Fire Tower climb doesn't care about your weekend warrior training plan. You need sustained power for constant rollers and the mental fortitude to handle September weather that swings from dust storms to mud festivals. If you can hold 250+ watts for three hours while navigating lottery systems and tourist crowds, this delivers old-school racing credibility.",

          "transcript": "[Music]\nIn the heart of northern Wisconsin,\nbetween the small towns of Cable and\nHayward, the woods come alive.\nThis is the Lifetime Schwamagan Mountain\nBike Festival, where history, grit, and\ncommunity all meet on two wheels.\n&gt;&gt; I am Cindy Smith Kener. I live right\nhere in Hayward, Wisconsin. I did my\nfirst Schwamagan 40 in 1984 cuz somebody\ntold me it would be the hardest thing I\never did. So I said, \"Sign me up.\" When\nit becomes this time of year where the\nleaves are turning, you smell the\nforest, you can smell the earth, you're\njust flying through those hilly grassy\nareas, and you're just loving life cuz\nit's fall and you get to spend a lot of\ntime out there. Since 1983, riders have\ngathered here to take on the rolling\ntrails of the Schwamagan National\nForest. What began with 27 cyclists has\ngrown into one of the most celebrated\noff-road races in the country. A true\nMidwest Classic that has welcomed\nlegends, rising stars, and thousands of\neveryday riders chasing their very own\nfinish line.\n&gt;&gt; I'm Tim Lewis. Uh, I'm from Phoenix,\nArizona, but I come to cable every\nsummer of my entire life. And I think\nI've done this event 30 times. Cable is\nreally all about community. And Gary\nKrannle way back in the day, whatever,\n42 years ago, decided to to start this\nevent. And it really did build a\ncommunity around it. I mean, uh, he had\nan amazing group of volunteers,\nuh, you know, with Steve Tilford being\npart of the first race and, yeah, I\nmean, cable's all about community, you\nknow, everybody's into the the pizza\nshop and, uh, Tilly's Trudy at Tilly's\ngetting pies and and this race just sort\nof brings everybody together like some\nof the other events here in in cable\nbetween the lakes and the woods and the\ntrails and um, it's just a magical\nplace.\n[Applause]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's pretty cool. And first time\nat Schwaming, I remember coming out to\nthe kids race and it was like 250 kids.\nI think this year is almost almost 350.\nSo, it's just special. It's an easy way\nto kind of forget the uh the stress of\nthe race tomorrow and kind of enjoy a\nnice evening. It's not even raining yet.\nWelcome to Hayward, Wisconsin, and stop\nnumber four of the 2025 Lif Lifetime\nGrand Prix. This is the Schwamagan 40.\nAffectionately known as the drag race\nfrom Hayward to Cable. It's 40 mi of\ngrit, glory, and full gas racing. While\nit's the shortest event in the Grand\nPrix calendar, make no mistake, it is\nabsolutely packed with action.\nHere we go. the map of the Schwamagan 40\nbike race, affectionately known as the\ndrag race from Hayward, Wisconsin up to\nCable, Wisconsin. The racers start out\nwith a grassy climb, which everyone\nloves to hate, into the single track.\nIt's all about getting that hole shot\nand essentially then everybody starts to\nsettle down. There are some gravel roads\nthat cross over the Berky Bonner course\nopens up just a little bit before they\nhead on to our first aid station of the\nday, double O. After double O, they're\ntreated to a little bit of a reprieve\nand then the action starts at the top of\nthe climb. So, you have the highest\npoint in the course, Fire Tower Hill,\nand then followed by the Seven Sisters\nafter this punchy, brutal climb. After\nthat climb, there's still nothing left\nbut pedaling and more undulations. And\nreally after this uh Timberland trail,\nthe finish starts to open up. The single\ntrack stops and then we head into power\nline. The undulations of power line wide\nopen, power laid towards the finish. And\nhere's the hero's welcome.\n&gt;&gt; And this year, the pro fields are\nstacked. On the women's side, we have\ncurrent overall series leader Cesaly\nDecker in town as well as last year's\nwinner Sophia Gomez Vafany.\nIt's just two points down in the\noverall. Well, there's no doubt Vafany\nwill not only be aiming for the repeat\nwin, but also the opportunity to move\nback into the top overall spot that\nshe's been so accustomed to. Misa\nRollins is also with us up here in the\nNorthwoods. Currently sitting third\noverall, she's no stranger to success,\nhaving stood on top of the podium back\nin 2021.\nShe's also riding a big wave of\nconfidence after being the highest\nplaced lifetime Grand Prix athlete at\nthe lifetime Leadville Trail 100\nmountain bike presented by Kinetic.\nOn the men's side, well, there's no\ndoubt that Keegan Swinson will have the\nbiggest bullseye on his back. In the\nmidst of an unparalleled run of form,\nhe's won his fifth straight lifetime\nLeadville Trail 100 mountain bike\npresented by Kinetic and was most\nrecently crowned the UCI Cross Country\nMarathon World Champion. He's also the\ndefending champion here and will surely\nbe looking to carry that form to a\nrepeat victory.\nJust seven points down in second, we\nhave the Swiss superstar Simone Pow\nmaking his Schwamagan debut. And he will\nno doubt keep Keegan on his toes. Don't\nforget, we also have last year's runner\nup in that tight sprint finish to the\nline, Alex Wild looking to avenge that\nloss.\nThe crowds are ready, the athletes are\nready. This is Schwamagan.\nAll right, and we are off and racing.\nEveryone clipped in. We even have some\ndrop bars here today. Alexis Scarda\nbasically leading it out the gate.\nMelissa Rollins sitting right there.\nSecond wheel Cesley Decker making sure\nthat she is moving up, getting good\nposition.\nWomen have absolutely gone out on course\nwith a tear and we are going to be\nentitled to the men doing the same\nthing. This hill is no joke. It is\nbeyond steep. The powers and clipping\ninto the chain rings that we're going to\nsee behind are astronomical. It's like\nthey have a second wind coming at us. So\nthey are humming up this hill making it\nlook absolutely easy off the start.\nAll right, we have a quick race update.\nRight here at mile 15, we have Sophia\nGomez Vafany leading a group of 10\nthrough headed towards 008 aid station.\nAnd quickly followed on her wheel is\nAlexis Garta, Melissa Rollins, Samara\nShepard also rounding out those top\nfour. And let's not forget we have\nCesaly Decker in here and Cecil Leune,\none of our newcomers to the Lifetime\nGrand Prix.\nRace update from mile 15. Keegan Swinson\nup front. Brendan Johnson, Cayenne\nOswolf out of Traverse City, Michigan\nright up there with Lesby, Alexi\nVermuing, Cole Patton, Braden Lang, and\nCam Jones.\nGet up.\nRacing has started to come to a little\nbit more of an agreement. And you can\nsee basically the what these integration\ngroups have done here is put forth a lot\nof effort and let some of the other\nfolks do the damage and the work here\nright now. All right guys, here we are\nat the base of Fire Tower right now.\nMelissa Robins leading the climb,\nleading this group up the climb. This\nwould be the highest point of the race.\nWe're about 25 26 miles in right now. We\nhad a lead group of 11. It was all come\nback together. Followed up right here at\nthe bottom. Jenna Reinhardt bringing up\nthe rear. And this was a crucial section\nof the race because essentially they\ncame off of nice gravel flowy roads onto\na less maintained road. So position is\ncrucial going into this climb.\nHere we are. Mile 31. We have Melissa\nRollins off the front solo with three\nchasers in Alexis Scarta, Sofhia, Visha,\nand Cesaly Decker. And off the back of\nthat group, another group of five or six\ncoming in hot. Here\nit is right here. Melissa solo win.\nCongratulations. Oh yeah.\nEnough time. Victory salute. And now it\nis the waiting game to see who's going\nto win out of the sprint between Alexis\nGarda, Sophia Vishafany, and Cesley\nDecker.\nAll right, guys. We're here with our\nwinner Melissa Rollins live giant team.\nYou just got hugged by your teammate\nPETA. Like talk about what today means\nand what this win means.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. So much. I mean I mean coming off\nof Leadville, I was super stoked about\nmy result, but I really I really wanted\nto win there. And I think just coming\noff of that, I was super motivated to\ngo. And yeah, I mean, we've had such a\nfun time up here in the Northwoods with\nthe Live Giant team. when we have a\nhouse on a lake. I mean, everyone does,\nbut like we've been having fun and it's\nsuch a good team environment and I just\nfeel like yeah, it it feels really nice\nto have such an awesome team around me\nand I feel like this win wasn't just for\nme, but it was for the whole team.\n&gt;&gt; Fire Tower Hill. It's steep. It's rocky.\nAfter that, a sick downhill to the Seven\nSisters. Punchy, grassy, and on to mile\n29.\nWheels are clipping right around this\ncorner\nled by Cam and\nKeegan sitting right there with Simone\nPolo, Matt Beers. All right, we're so\nclose to the finish and last year's\nsprint finish was the same thing that's\nshaping up today except Alexi has got a\nlittle bit of a gap over Beers and Kayen\nOlen tight there with Lesby, Matthew\nWilson, Cole Patton still in this group\nagain this year. Keegan Swinson not\nletting anybody go as they head to the\nsprint for the finish.\nTaking it. Alexi Vermuion snuck out in\nfront. Alexi tucked on in, taking\nsecond. Check it out. Johnson Torbjorn,\nAlexi, a tactical race today. You came\nthrough at the finish line where you\nplanned and wanted to be all day long.\nWhat happened in that last mile? Where\ndid you make your move and how come it\nstuck? Um I I don't actually remember. I\nstarted trying probably 7 miles to go\nand you can see the group was\nsplintering but guys were chasing but\nyou always know that rubber band's going\nto snap when there start to have some\ngaps opening. So I kind of just bided my\ntime. I could tell that anybody who got\non my wheel wasn't really willing to\nwork. It's such a such a long way to the\nfinish. I mean, to be honest, I didn't\nthink anyone could go solo. Um, but in\nthe end, just kind of trusted myself,\nsaw the gap happen, and committed. I\nmean, it's one of those times that once\nyou commit, you just have to believe in\nyourself, cuz once the group comes back,\nthey're going to beat you in the sprint.\n&gt;&gt; And for our final race results today\nhere at the Schwamigan 40, Melissa\nRollins bringing home the solo win.\nHands up in the air, followed by a\nsprint finish with Sophia Vishafany in\nsecond place. Alexis Scarter rounding\nout third place, Cesley Decker fourth,\nand Aaron Osborne in fifth place. And\nlet's also mention Ruth Pul who is\nleading our U23 women's division right\nthere in 10th place. And today's results\nin the Schwamigan 40. Alexi Vermuan on\nthe top step with a gap over the chasing\nsprint group behind him with Kayen\nOlshov a local out of Traverse City,\nMichigan in second place just 8 seconds\nbehind with the big group of Brendan\nJohnson, Torbjorn Road in fourth. Kobe\nFreeburn rounding out the top five and\nthen Braden Lang, Simone Po, Cam Jones,\nPacin McKelvin, and Lesby right there 10\nseconds behind. Let's take a look at our\nwomen's lifetime Grand Prix standings\nafter the Schwamagan 40 mountain bike\nrace. Sophia Vishafany moving into first\nplace, knocking Cesley Decker down to\nsecond place. Melissa Rollins having\nthird place right now. Alexis Scarta\nmoving up into fourth place. And\nrounding out the top five, Cecil Leune\ncontinues to hold on to her fifth place\nAnd now we take a look at the men's\nstandings after the Schwamagan 40\nmountain bike race. Not much has changed\nout of that top three. Still the same\npositioning for Keegan Swinson taking\nthat first spot. Closely followed by\nSimone Pillow followed by Torbin Ru. And\nin fourth place, Alexi now moves up in\nposition there, followed by Cam Jones,\nrounding out the top five. Thanks\neveryone for following along the\nSchwamagan 40 mountain bike race. We\nlook forward to seeing you in a couple\nof weeks in Bentonville for Little Sugar\nand Big Sugar to round out the Lifetime\nGrand Prix. For Nat Ross, I'm Lauren\nHall, and we look forward to seeing you\nin a couple of weeks.",

for\nsaying hi we just like people coming up\nto the area and enjoying\nthemselves it's what we do it's a part\nof our fabric this is my first time my\ndad uh used to time this race for about\n20 years so coming back we wanted to\ncreate an event that was uh perpetuated\nthat was attractive to families for the\nbenefit of the\ncommunity SC\nlittle this is basically the kickoff to\nthe main event we travel full time as a\nfamily going around a bike racing this\nis my first time doing 40 this year\nthere's guys that have been doing it\nthey walk up to our booth they let us\nknow that they've been here for 37 years\nevery year and then we get people coming\nby the booth that have you know this is\ntheir first time and they're just as\nexcited first time on a mountain bike\nhere I've been on a fat bike the last\nthree years so the Schwan 40 is stop\nnumber four in the lifetime Grand Prix\npresented by Mazda a seven event series\nthat takes on some of the most legendary\ncycling events in the United States\nthese athletes are competing for a\n$300,000 prize purse that will be\nawarded in October after the final race\nbut now it's time for the schaman 40\nlast year we saw a Sprint finish in both\nthe women's and men's fields and we\nexpect another exciting finish this year\nto what is the shortest and fastest\nevent in the lifetime Grand Prix\npresented by\nMazda welcome everybody to the schaman\n40 this classic point-to-point race\ntakes Riders through 39 miles of iconic\nWisconsin North Woods following parts of\nthe famous berky cross country ski Trail\nour athletes are starting to make their\nway to the start line but before we join\nthe let's take a look at the lifetime\nGrand Prix leader board brought to you\nby\nsbl after the race in Leadville our top\nthree men in the Grand Prix are Keegan\nPac and llin with 94 87 and 83 points\nrespectively behind them it's Matt beers\nand Toby Road rounding out the top\nfive on the women's side Sophia is\nholding on to her familiar first place\nspot with 88 points Five Points back\nfrom her is Haley Smith Hannah Otto is\nin third with 81 and Alexis scarta and\nSarah Sturm hold the fourth and fifth\nplace spots and now we're only moments\naway from the next installment in the\nGrand Prix where we'll see if anybody\ncan shake up the top of the\nleaderboard now this is the shortest and\nfastest of the Grand Prix courses part\nmountain bike part gravel and all\nAdventure it's a thrilling ride not to\nmention with rain clouds looming these\nathletes are probably going to be\ndealing with some mud as well for a\ncloser look at the schaman 40 course\nhere's Michelle Duffy once\nagain the Schwan 40 begins at Wheeler\nRoad in Hayward Wisconsin it runs 38.6\nmiles over the famed American Burk biner\nski Trail as well as Forest roads and\nwooded paths to the Finish Line at the\ndurksen family Great Hall in Cable\nWisconsin the course is known for its\nPunchy climbs and high speeds as the\nRiders will gain roughly 2500 ft of\nelevation over the course of 2 to 2 and\n1/2 hours for the Elite field there's\nonly one opportunity to stop for team\nsupport in this race and it's at the\nDouble O checkpoint at mile 15 a popular\nplace for spectators to gather and cheer\non the Riders at Mile 21 they will\ncontend with the cely fire tower climb\nthe course's biggest feature at Mile 26\nthe Riders will be on the berky ski\nTrail as they roll into Seven Sisters a\nseries of seven Punchy climbs finally\njust before the end there's a tight\nsection known as the sleigh Trail after\nthat it's back on the burky where\nSpectators will be lined up for a Sprint\nfinish up first we got the pro women who\nwill have a 30 minute Head Start of the\nmen so we'll follow them out and catch\nthe beginning of their race then double\nback for the start of the men and the\nstart should be interesting it's at the\nbottom of this steep grassy cross\ncountry ski hill I wouldn't be surprised\nif we see a selection right off the bat\nwithout further Ado let's get right into\nit with the start of the women's\nrace 5 4 3 2\n[Music]\n1 I think it will be fast from the GetGo\nfrom the start because\nit's also so short everyone wants to do\nwell and you can't necessarily just wait\nfor the Finish Line to make a\ndifference Alexa scardo right now at the\nfront set Pace Matty Monroe sitting\nsecond again two key rers that are\nthrowing a little different Dynamic to\nthe race M Monroe cilia\nbong energy conservation is so important\nI want to be in the front in a good\nposition where I can carry speed up and\nover the rollers\nthis is kind of a crazy race because\nthere's really only one good fast line\nthey've come over that first rise now\nthey've got a couple of rollers can kind\nof settle in a bit\nmore the word out on course is that the\nwomen are about 8 mil in and riding in a\nlarge group on the single track Aaron\nOsborne is in the lead but there isn't\nmuch separation with Aaron Huck on her\nwheel Alexis in the third position and\nabout 15 other Riders all lined up Swan\nas a race is super unique a lot of\npeople like to call the Midwest flat but\nI would say there isn't a single flat\npart of the course back on the gra for\nthe first\nattack heard some people reference it to\nlike Mario Kart like the rainbow race at\nMario Kart um it kind of feels like that\nwhen you're going with a big\npack think you start to blow up a bit\ngot Auto off the back fre off the so\nthere you have it about 15 miles in and\nthe women's field is already starting to\ncome apart we'll catch back up with the\nwomen at the 8 station but first it's\ntime to go back to the start line for\nthe beginning of the men's\nrace you're going into this race like\nexpected to to be on the podium that can\nthat can set you back you know mess with\nyour head and and stuff so having no\nexpectations nothing to\nlose start in the 40 it's fast it's so\nfast this whole shot really important to\nget a good position on this grass\nupville leading out of the start the\nstart riding through some of that grass\nit's like you you feel like you're\nworking so hard just like musling the\nbike and you're barely going anywhere so\nthere it is the entire Elite field is on\ncourse and the schaman 40 is underway in\nthe first half everyone's quite strong\nand there's no sustained climb or\ntechnical terrain so everyone can sort\nof hang on or sort of yo-yo off the bat\nI would never give any kind of a gap\ntook whole patent on his own but never\nmind with brain lag as well if the pace\nisn't like full gas at the very\nbeginning might make some digs sounds\nlike we have some action off the front\nas Cole Patton and Braden Lang have\nseparated from the\npack bra Lang whole pack being caught by\nKeegan\nthere always like little Partnerships\nout there sometimes and I feel think\nthose guys were going to be up to\nsomething I want to win the race like\nthat's always the goal but you know I\ndon't need to win this race the 12 mile\nmarch to orat going for the\nCounterattack but now he's solo and he's\ngoing to have to wait for another group\nto coales behind him we love to see an\nanimated race and in the early goings\nthe men's field is giving us just that\nbut now let's Jump Ahead to the a\nstation and rejoin our women's\nfield 15 big group so as the women clear\nthe 8 station let's check the\nleaderboard brought to you by SB at Mile\n17 it's basically one big group with\ncivilia blun currently in the front\nfollowed closely by Deana Maes Sophia\nMelisa Rollins and Michaela Thompson\nrounding out the top\nfive me out come on we're hearing there\nwas a couple crashes in the women's\nfield involving Aaron Huck Hannah Otto\nand Jenna Reinhardt amongst others so\nthat's really thinning things out early\nand we'll just see if any of those\nRiders are able to make it back into\ncontention and now Haley Smith is also\nhaving some kind of trouble out on\ncourse I don't actually know what I'm\ndealing with the mechanics that allow\nyour lungs to expand properly your\ndiaphragm to move fluidly they're not\nworking properly for me I don't trust it\nto come around I'm so it's been 8 months\nand I don't know how to make it I don't\nknow how to get better Tre doesn't put\npressure on it but that said this is my\njob if it takes too long to fix then\nthere becomes pressure we hope to see\nher back out there real soon but now\nlet's catch up with the rest of the\nwomen's Fe\nstrategically it's really important to\nstay close to the front because if\nsomeone makes a move you need to be\nthere and you need to be ready our\nwomen's field is now turning off the\nroad and headed up fir Tower this is a\npivotal part of the\ncourse A lot of times this is where we\nsee a breakaway\nhappen you need to burn as many matches\nas you possibly need to even before the\nbig climb here's a look at Sophia's data\nfrom her garment device as she makes her\nway up fire fire\ntower fire tower is where a lot starts\nto happen in the race sevilia looking\ncalm Alexa scarta determination on her\nface coming through and here you can see\nAlexis's Garmin data up and over fire\ntower is also super important cuz\nafterwards you have the berky rollers\nthis like undulating slog of small\nclimbs that add up and can really um\nbreak the AP parts so now coming out of\nthe cely fire tower the women's field is\nreally starting to break up as Sophia\nsevilia and Alexis Hold the top three\nspots with a gap on the rest of the\nfield we got our lead through the three\ncoming through and a significant Gap\nback to Fourth to six the rest of the\ngroup whatever's left again SP all of\nyour matches because that's where the\nrace breaks up that's where it happens\nnow we're spread out now we're split up\nnow we're getting down to\nit all right looking at the Garin tread\nXL it looks like our women are going to\nbe coming in in about 25\nminutes all three are going to want to\nroll together almost all the way to the\nfinish and then those last couple of\nmiles that's when all bets are off it's\ngoing to be a good\nfinish as our lead women start closing\nin on the Finish let's go back to the a\nstation to get the latest from the men's\nrace\nToby when we left off Tobin Orton blad\nhad just counterattacked the field and\nwent solo off the front as they enter\ndouble O that is still the case as Tobin\nnow has a one-minute gap for the rest of\nthe top 10 here's your leaderboard\nbrought to you by\nsbl similar to the women everyone is\nstill bunched together with Alex how\nKeegan Matt beers and Alex wild in spots\ntwo through five now let's throw it back\nout to Tim as the men take their turn on\nfire tower in the meat of the\nraceing this group really they they\nhaven't determined if they're going to\nbe chasing or there just going to be\nwaiting to see what happens to Tobin\nit's interesting to see some of the guys\nthat choose to really push their marbles\ninto the middle of the ring so early\nwhen the group is still really big and\nto get that elastic to snap that early\nin the race is a big\nass going up the fire tower climb so\nthis is going to be the big test the\nelastic is most likely to snap on fire\ntower Tobin really hammering this CL he\nis looking so good and this climb just\nkeeps coming up and up and up fire tower\nis a separator because it causes a deep\npower you need multiple r ERS who are\nwilling to trade turns to really snap\nthat elastic as Tobin TOS out at fire\ntower let's take a look at Pac and\nmine's data from his Garmin devices as\nwe watch the chase group climb from his\nPOV because you're working against a\ngroup behind you and likely the group\nbehind you is Big here we go check it in\nfrom the top of the fire tower climb\nKeegan Swinson leading up Alex Wild on\nthe left Sean finchum having a great\nride Canadian national Marathon Mountain\nB champion and here you can see Matt\nbeers' data from his Garmin device as he\nmakes his way up fire to Tower question\nin my mind is will we have a huge 15\nperson Sprint again or will it be a\nsmaller group that gets away after fir\nTower and the berky rollers as the men's\nfield makes its way through seven\nsisters Tobin is still hanging on to\nthat lead but the chase behind him has\nstarted to dwindle as what was a group\nof over 20 Riders is now down to seven\ncan Tobin hold on we'll find out in a\nbit but first it's time to jump back\nover to the women for the conclusion of\ntheir\nrace back with our group of three and\ncivilia just put in an\nattack but nullified by\nsopia Alexis is on that whe as\nwell it's time to take a look at our\nwomen's leader board brought to you by\nsbl so under 10 miles to the finish and\nour three leaders Sophia sevilia and\nAlexis remain out in front a minute\nbehind them Madigan Monroe and Gabrielle\naguera are chasing together and then\nanother 90 seconds or so back from them\nwe have a larger Chase group of about\nsix\nRiders at this point in the race it's\nlooking like the podium position for our\nthree leaders will be decided with a\nSprint\nfinish soon as I get into position after\nthe big climb I start thinking about\ntrying to reserve some energy for a\nSprint finish and so that's when you\nstart thinking about how many matches do\nI have left after spending all that to\nget you know away from from the pack\nthese ladies are fly right now uh finish\nof this race is really tricky because uh\nagain like positioning is super\nimportant and when you're on the front\nyou don't have the draft from the other\nRider uh so you're naturally pushing\nmore power than the Riders behind you\nit's a downhill\nfinish essentially if it's a three-up\nSprint it's going to be a drag race it's\ngoing to be whoever's got the biggest\ngearing on their bike cuz they are\nflying down here you just have to kind\nof act on Instinct and go with your gut\nuh and not hesitate all right Cable\nWisconsin your lead women are\napproaching the Finish let's hear it\nFocus out it's about to go down right\nhere right now Swan 2024 presented by TR\nbik here we go Sprint all the way\nining everyway fin here we go come on we\ngot one we got two and they're going to\ncome out we got we got one coming around\nthe back side are they going to come to\nthe\nFinish sopia Gomez vishe with the win\nholy cow Alexa second again two years in\na row\nso there you have it Sophia Alexis and\nsevilia one two and three Gabrielle\naguera takes fourth with Madigan Monroe\nin fifth and now there's a second Sprint\nunfolding Aaron Huck is in there after\nfighting her way back but it looks like\npaig onweller Deana males and Anna Hicks\nare going to separate from the other\nthree and Pa onweller wins the Sprint\nfor a sixth place finish here's the\nleader board brought to you by for the\nrest of the women's\nfield Paige goes for six Deanna M\nseventh Anna Hicks eighth Melissa\nRollins ninth and Samara Shepard rounds\nout the top 10 Aaron Huck worked her way\nup to 11th Place Aaron Osborne 12th\nJenna Reinhardt was also able to work\nher way back up Landing in 13th Place\nand now it's the men's turn last we\nheard Tobin Orton blad was out front\nsolo with a strong Chase group nipping\nat his heels in including his teammate\nKeegan swensson let's go back out to Tim\nto join up with the men as the end of\ntheir race is now rapidly closing\nin we have a mixup that section through\nthe woods after the fire tower climb\nreally just broke this race up toin orl\njust hanging on right now so your SLI\nleaderboard Keegan now out front with\npacon Matt beers Shawn finchamp Alex\nwild and John Borman now together with\nTobin who they obviously caught\nthis one is looking like it's going to\nbe a six or seven person Sprint to\ndetermine the winner after fire tower\nthere's some grass rollers I know that\npart is going to be quite hard and I\nthink we can get rid of a couple more\npeople on that\nsection it looks like we have gone from\nthat massive group of about 40 down to\nabout a dozen up and over the clim we\nsaw Keegan pressing the pace knowing\nthat his teammate was up the road\nbut then after that I mean the group\nyou're in is the Sprint for the finish\nand yeah you just got to prepare for the\nSprint and think about your\npositioning checking in from Wild Marker\n37 course getting near the Finish you\ncan just see the tension in that group\nstarting to\nbuild my goal if it came to the Sprint\nfinish was I knew it was a long Sprint\nand there's like two bumps and it's as\nsoon as we got over the first bump no\nmatter what I was just going to Sprint\nfrom there and essentially close my eyes\nand not open them until we're at the\nFinish Line one of the reasons the\nSprint is so hard here is because of\nthat downhill element and the fact that\nthere's a plateau before it here comes\nthe lead Moto going by for the\nfinish the wide grassy downhill finish\nof Shaman 40 the Sprint has started\nyou're sprinting on that last Riser\nbefore you see the finish and inevitably\nbecause you're going early it's a longer\nSprint Tobin leading it out Shan\nfinerman second Alex wild going early in\nthe Sprint Keegan swon picking it up\npacing and Matt beers pulling up the\nrear you know I've lost Sprints because\nI haven't pushed all the way to the line\nbefore and you think you have it but\nthen someone sneaks by at the end so you\nhave to make sure you just stop on the\npedals and just just put the pressure\ndown finally we won this train and\nKeegan swensson holds on for the win of\nthe schaman 40 mountain bike race and\nthe fourth stop of the lifetime Grand\nPrix oh no looks like we had several\nRiders go down in the second Bunch\nSprint of the\nday what an exciting finish to a fast\nand furious day of racing we had Keegan\nSwenson with the win Alex wild in second\nSean finchum in third Pac melvan in\nfourth and Matt beers in fifth to round\nout the podium here in the Northwoods of\nWisconsin Cole Patton ends up in 11th\nBrendan Johnson takes 12th and Dylan\nJohnson 13th and Alexi last year's\nwinner ends up in\n14th pretty textbook day of tactics we\ndon't always execute but today we got it\nso felt good go to finally win schwam\nagain I could win seaotter Unbound\nLeadville Crusher always screwed it at\nschwam again and\nfinally that's tough those Rolling Hills\nthe punches they're very tough\nshocks\ntoo me and Cole put in some hard some\nhard efforts and paid for them we were\nboth kind of like we just need to\nsalvage some points now\nhas anyone seen the finish time as they\ncame across the line 2\nhours01 so close to\nBreaking yeah it was fun it was a good\nfun racing\nagain it's crazy race Moran that's why\nwe\nlove and with today's results here's\nyour updated sbl leaderboard for the\noverall standings in the lifetime Grand\nPrix presented by Mazda now that we're\nfour races in these scores reflect two\ndrop races so Keegan still in front with\n70 points Lin now second with 66 and\nCole and pacon are now tied for third\nwith 62 on the women's side Sophia is in\nfront with 70 P John Weller is in second\nwith 66 Haley Smith is in third with 62\nand Alexis and Melissa Rollins are now\ntied for fourth with 60\npoints and that's going to do it for us\nhere at the schaman 40 in Cable\nWisconsin but we will see you again soon\nas the next race is only 2 weeks away as\nwe head to Trinidad Colorado for the rad\non September 28th until then I'm Bill\nEllison here with Tim Johnson and Lauren\nHall the lifetime events team and the\ncold collaborative

This race is an icon of mountain biking in Wisconsin, and in mountain bike racing in general as it's been going strong for over 35 years.  This race doesn't have any mountains to climb, but it is a relentless 40 miles of roller after roller after roller, with lots of rough, rocky, and washed out ATV and snowmobile trails mixed in.  There are a few gravel road sections to get your heart rate down, catch your breath, and grab a snack, but otherwise you're full gas all day.  \n\nhttps://www.cheqmtb.com/\n\nhttps://www.strava.com/segments/762471\n\n#bike #bikelife #bikelover #cycling #bikeride #mtb #mtblife #mtblove #mtbtrails #mtbrace #bikerace #mountainbike #mountainbikeracing #lifetime #lifetimefitness #lifetimegrandprix #ltgp #hillclimb #wisconsin #bikewisconsin #mtbwisconsin #midwestmtb #bikefestival #chequamegon40 #chequamegonfattirefestival #fattire #gopro #drone #dronevideo #hoverair #hoverairx1pro #trekbikes #yeticycles #specialized #giantbikes #canyonbikes #santacruz #santacruzbikes #alliedbikes #orangseal #wisconsin #discoverwisconsin #onlyinwisconsin\n#northwoods #northwoodswisconsin #upnorth #ridebikes #biketrail #ride",

Uh yeah, it's\na highlight of the Schwamian Fat Teraf\nmountain bike race. It's probably the\nhardest hill on the whole whole course.\nIt's pretty formidable. Uh it's about\n220 ft elevation gain over 4/10 of a\nmile. Pretty short, but it is steep. Uh\nyeah, this first section here I think\ngets to about 15%.\nAnd there's a middle section about 17%.\nThen at the very top we get up to I\nthink 21.\nSo yeah, it's steep.\nUh, every time I've done it during the\nSchwamian race,\nI've had to walk. I'm a midpack rider\nand the trail has a lot of people in it\nby then. And we're all walking.\nWe're not winning anything. We're out\nhere to have fun. But, uh, yeah. Oh, I'm\non the bottom. Already out of gears.\nYeah.\nFirst little section.\nOkay.\nHit a little\nflat spot.\nTry to catch your breath.\nlost her drone.\nSo, my drone\njust tapped a tree branch and crashed.\nSelf-flying drone. It just follows you.\nBut it doesn't like little hanging uh\ntree limbs at all.\nThe last two years I've\npartied up at the top handing out cans\nof hams beer and uh I have to say it is\nimpressive\nhow fast the pros ride up this.\nJust mindboggling.\nAll\nright, now we're crossing Berky Trail.\nThere's two parallel trails for the\nBerky Classic and Skate.\nThey're both closer to the top. So,\nwe're almost there.\nYeah, this is steep.\nHave to go around this tree.\nHere we got our final push.\nLast year had my chainsaw out. I was\nrevving it down here by this puddle. So\nI know we're near the top.\nYeah. Fennel push\ngets up to\n21%.\nI think we got this.\nour other Berky trail.\nAnd last little bit can see the top.\nAnd there you are.\nTop of fire tower.\nEmbark maple syrup. They usually have\ntheir impromptu aid station there. And\nfree well bike. The last few they've\nbeen setting up here. It's kind of nice.\nand I've been all over in this area\nhanding out cans of hams. But yeah, Fire\nTower Hill. And anyways, folks, remember\nwe're all in this together and I'm\npulling for you.

here and a\na 90 in here plus we got a flask this\nhas three scoops like 100 G or so that's\nhow easy nutrition is going to be be for\nthis 2hour race two bottles and a flask\nthe flask is just for extra if you want\nto make your nutrition process as easy\nas this use code carry 20 for 15% off at\nflow formulas. comom so this is a\npoint-to-point race which means you\nstart at one spot and finish at a\ndifferent spot and in this case they're\n40 m apart Michael races at 10 so I've\ngot to take him to the start park the\nvan then take a shuttle bus and I got to\nbe there at 11:00 just a

that that big\nbunch Sprint of 14 that seemed like a\nlot of fun but way 8 miles to go over\nthe top of fire tower climb I was able\nto kind of cut my losses and I came off\nthe back there but then got back on on\nthe other\nside uh but then we hit some Punchy\nstuff that was really\nsloggy and\nyeah I came off I couldn't do it so I\nwatched the front group kind of ride\naway and then I was like teing by myself\nfor a bit until Brenan wz and laan and\nIan and I think one other guy kind of\ncaught me and I was with them for a bit\nuntil we started catching some of the\nsome of the people that started in front\nof us and we kind of came in a hill and\nI got pinched between somebody we were\npassing I had to put a foot down and\nthen I had to watch them ride away so\nthat was like the next Sprint uh so just\nsome bad luck there and I think I came\nacross the line in like 21st so I was\ntied with a couple guys for 18th uh beat\na couple of them like Tobin and AD Ro\nBear yeah and I mean like I could have\nhad a worse day I could have could have\nhad a day like Tobin\nhad uh so now I'm sitting like 23rd in\nthe series with two more to go the next\none's Trinidad in Colorado not looking\nforward to that one cuz it's at altitude\nbut there's not a ton of climbing so\nhopefully I can throw something together\nfor that and then the last one big sugar\nso yeah there's still some hope cracking\nthe top 15 maybe uh putting some more\ngood results in so going to go back home\nI got a weekend off and then it's\nTrinidad so yeah we'll see you guys\nthere",

This is going to be one\nfast mountain bike race in front of us\ntoday. You know, you can try and put a\nlot into Swarmingham, but like we're all\nfit riders, but then you throw something\nlike this in, it's really exciting.

Well,\n&gt;&gt; we go from racing at super high\nelevation at Leadville,\nand then a month later, we have to tune\nour engines to sea level race, really\nshort and punchy, completely different\nrace demands, a lot more short sprint\nworkouts, just trying to get some\nhigh-end power.\nI think Schwamagan is one of the hardest\nraces in the Grand Prix to win.\nyou get one shot and you got to back\nyourself and believe in yourself. And so\nevery time you see someone win here, if\nit's not in the sprint, they completely\nbacked themselves on some random little\nclimb and held on for dear life.\n[Music]\nSince a couple years ago, we start\nstraight up a hill, which just makes\neverybody wonder what's coming.\n&gt;&gt; There's a lot of energy. It's the one\nrace where we take off full gas from the\nstart. And I love starts like that where\nno one's talking. We're just like locked\nin and ready to go. Just make sure you\nclip in, start pedaling, and then kind\nof fight for position as you get over\nthe first climb.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the start of Schwamagan was uh\nless than perfect. missed my pedal three\ntimes, but uh that's that's how racing\ngoes.\n&gt;&gt; They are humming up this hill making it\nlook absolutely easy.\n&gt;&gt; Cam Jones actually went out front off\nthe start.\nHe was obviously willing to go to that\nlevel and then there's like the rest of\nus who are willing to go to like, you\nknow, what felt kind of reasonable. It\nwas kind of a a cat and mouse game for\nthe first 15 minutes. And once you\nsettle in, I think that's when the true\nracing starts cuz before that it's a lot\nof uh just mental stress.\nThe race was really just on um from the\nbeginning to the end.\nIt was just kind of people trying to\nmake their moves, others chasing it\ndown. Then I think a lot of people kind\nof looked to Matt and to Keegan to kind\nof get the race back under control,\nwhich I think is frustrating for them. I\nguess for me, I was just kind of like\ntrying to ride good position.\nSchwarmagan is like a big washing\nmachine. You know, it's constantly\nriders moving up on the side and\ndrifting back. there. You know, we have\na really wide grass field, but the\nreality is one racing line. You\nconstantly have to be moving forward,\notherwise you're moving backwards. Um,\nand I think there's something that comes\nfrom the road that helps me with that.\nAnd it's all a chess match and uh the\nwinner is uh always right at this race\nand it changes every year.\nIt's the long season in the Lifetime\nGrand Prix and this is a very\nchallenging event. Schwamagan is no test\nof anything but skills, power,\ndetermination.\nSo we have 16 in that lead group at this\npoint. Still sizable, but that was the\nearly animation from Simone, from\nKeegan, from Matt Beers.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it kind of stayed together. There\nwas some surging, but like I say,\neveryone can kind of hang on for that,\nyou know, grit their teeth and hang on\nfor 10 or 20 seconds and and make it\nover this the crest of the climb and\nthen it sort of like sits up again. And\nfire tower is always like a big\nselective point on this course. It's\nkind of the only steep climb.\nThe fight in the fire tower I feel like\nis kind of changing a little bit. Um,\nevery year it definitely is hard, but we\nused to kind of see that as a big split\nin the race. I don't I think everyone's\njust strong now. The depth in the Grand\nPrix is growing a lot.\n&gt;&gt; Come on. Come on. You got this. Go.\nLet's go. Go, go, go, go, go.\n&gt;&gt; It solidified our lead group of 15 or 20\nriders, but um, nobody broke away. We\nall kind of stayed together.\nI think from fire tower on toward the\nfinish. Uh you kind of get on the dirt\nroad for a second and then you kind of\nget back off onto what we call seven\nsisters, seven big climbs. Um kind of\nroll over this grass field and Keegan\nwas hitting it pretty hard. I was really\nhoping that uh we would kind of break\ninto a smaller group on those rollers.\nBut um since the speed's so high, the\ndraft is so good, and um so many people\ncame into the end, I was thinking, \"Oh,\nthis is not the plan.\"\nProbably sevenish miles to go. I started\nkind of feeling people out. Um I\nattacked on one roller and uh Matt and\nCayenne came with me. Um but they\nwouldn't really commit. Did it again.\nThey both same guys came with me again.\nAnd then I saw Matt chasing and I was\nlike, \"Okay, well like this, you guys\nstill aren't committing.\" and um kind of\nheld back for a second and then four\nmiles to go just on one of the last big\nsteep rollers. I just came over the top\nof a couple guys and I was like, \"Well,\nnow's the time to commit. Looked back\nonce, had a gap, and I was like probably\n10 to 12 minutes from the finish line\nhere and I know what I can do.\" And so I\njust kind of hit it as hard as I could,\nfocused on speed.\nThat point you there's no reason to look\nback. Race is coming behind you. I knew\nexactly what what I had to do. Uh the\nquestion is always just you know how how\nfast is the group and what are they\ngoing to do working together. Yeah. So I\nwent uh in these last rollers in the\ndifferent finish. Uh there was a young\nguy out in between Alexi and the group.\nI went across to him um from the group\nand then he and I just I mean I knew\nthat that was second place in the Grand\nPrix. So I was willing to just bury it\nand stay out in front of the group.\nAnd yeah, I just thought, you know,\neveryone was kind of looking to Matt and\nKeegan and I was just like, I'm going to\ngo go around them and try. Um, it's time\nto try something. I think I think that\nwas maybe where we made the mistake was\njust letting letting those moves go and\nthen um hesitating and the group swelled\nup and then it came down to just this\nmassive group for the for the final\nsprint.\n&gt;&gt; Here we go. Here we go. Give some room,\nladies and gentlemen. Here we go. down\nto the final stretch right there off the\nfront. Alexi Bel\nyour 2025\nSchwaban\nchampion\nthe Michigan boy makes it stick. What\na dust storm of adrenaline and\nexcitement.\nWhat a finish.\nIt was pretty great. I was probably the\nmost smoked I've been at a Schwamagan\nwin. Um, couldn't even get two hands off\nthe bars. Afraid I was going to crash.\nBut yeah, I mean, the feeling of winning\nsolo is something that I is really hard\nto describe. There's that one moment\nright before the finish line where you\nfeel it.\n&gt;&gt; You did it, buddy.\n&gt;&gt; I hated the last 1.8 miles.\n&gt;&gt; It's just so emotional, right? You back\nyourself. It's very, very quick in that,\nyou know, that one second you have to\nyourself before you cross.\n&gt;&gt; I'm stoked. Like I was in a bit of a\nhole after Leadville just like mentally.\nSo to come back and like consolidate\nwhich is like what I wanted to do at\nLeadville. I'm not sure where I'll end\nup once we drop Leadville. But yeah,\nLittle Sugar will be a fun race. It's\nreally cool to come to the Northwoods\nhere in Wisconsin. Um this is like a\nreally warm welcome to fall.\n&gt;&gt; I think one of the things I love about\nthe race is all the camaraderie that\ncomes out between the guys.\nThere's a lot of stress around a lot of\nraces, but this is one that I think\npeople, you know, for the most part are\nexcited to race together. And I I really\nenjoy that.",
