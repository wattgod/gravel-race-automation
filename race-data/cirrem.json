Less climbing than The Mid South."

Late February timing delivers everything from 2019's \"foggy with periods of rain turning to snow late, low 30's\" to 2022's \"4 inches of snow two days prior.\" Race organizer remembers \"stopping several times to wring the water out of my mittens\" and riders with \"bright-red gloveless hands.\" It's winter warfare, not marketing copy. More weather exposure than Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

        "explanation": "Cumming, Iowa sits at corn-growing elevation—essentially sea level for racing purposes. The thin air you'll experience comes from 30-degree temperatures hitting your lungs, not altitude. Any breathing difficulty stems from frozen February conditions, not oxygen deprivation. Lower altitude than Gravel Worlds — no thin-air concerns."

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Frozen gravel through Madison County in February conditions offers adventure, but it's more 'survive the elements' than 'explore the unknown.' The self-supported format and open roads add real risk—organizers explicitly warn about slippery conditions and high speeds with car traffic. It's adventure through attrition rather than exotic terrain."

Winners finish around 4 hours while others suffer for 6+ hours on frozen gravel through Madison County's winding hills. The pile-up among leaders in slippery conditions shows what happens when winter racing meets minimal course management."

You'll remember every frozen mile of those 64 miles through Madison County."

        "explanation": "The equipment list—\"mountain bikes, cross bikes, ss's, fenders, fixies, fat bikes and even road bikes\"—shows this crowd prioritizes showing up over showing off.

      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Registration runs $60-100. Cumming, Iowa doesn't command destination race pricing for lodging and meals. Nearest major airport likely Des Moines, about 40 miles out, keeping travel costs reasonable. The race's \"absolutely no transfers and no refunds\" policy and minute-long sellout suggest pricing hits the sweet spot for committed winter racers. Similar expense level to Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."
