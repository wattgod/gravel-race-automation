        "score": 1,

        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Final round of the Bushranger Gravel Series sounds meaningful until you realize nobody outside NSW knows what that is.

      "experience": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Steampacket Hotel beer garden provides the classic finish line scene where \"you couldn't wipe the smile off many faces.\" The car camping setup across from the pub creates the intended \"drink with friends, watch sunset, sweet car camping\" atmosphere. Social execution over competitive intensity."

        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "15-20 kph target speeds and requirement to \"be at a good level of fitness\" suggests recreational rather than competitive fields. Navigation skills required for GPX following. The social overnighter format and small field size indicate limited competitive depth."

        "explanation": "$179 early bird includes professional photos, feed zones, mechanical support, and commemorative patches.
