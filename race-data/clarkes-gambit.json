time I am sort of semi packed\nkind of got the truck sorted uh ready to\ngo bit of solar on and I'm going to head\ndown to the start line I'm wondering\nwhat time is it probably going to be\nthere early 7:30 nah only about 27\nminutes early go down see what's up I\ngot a crooked crooked hat oh always have\na crooked\nhat we have go for cl Gambit 2023 enjoy\nenjoy\nenjo my all my\nhe it's a nasty\nHill straight up to the top of the hill\nthen make a right yeah straight up to\nthe top of the hill yeah I literally had\nto ride it up up this yesterday after\nthe ride and I could barely get\nup I already feel like I'm going too\nfast everyone's going slow which means\nI'll probably pick up later anyway some\nmore\ndownhill\nRolling Hills that's what I've been told\nRolling\nHills it's like a big red bit coming up\nI don't know the Reds aren't quite as\nnasty as the length today that's going\nto be tough the long enduring climbs\nit's an 8K climb today o\nhalfway up this like 7K or just shy of\n7K climb yet to hit the hard bits it's\nup and down I think that's good gives\nyou that ability to get a slight\nrecovery I'm still feeling like I'm\npushing too hard I'm trying to slow down\na\nbit we'll see oh he's caught up yeah\nthis is a long climb h ah we're getting\nthe reprieves yeah so it's not bad for\nthat\nholy\n[&nbsp;__&nbsp;]\nyou yeah I'm good thank\nyou so Tony would have just blitzed this\nI got [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] dropped by the guys it was\nintense that's a downhill and a half\nI've not had that level of like break\ncrazy riding ever but just took my own\ntime it was\ncool like I'm going slow as [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] this\n[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is\nsteep\nI lost my lost grip for a second had to\nput a foot down but I'm riding it it's\njust [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]\nhard way more than I thought it was\ngoing to be look at this I know gorgeous\nhuh oh big day it is how was yesterday\nfor you I'm not so bad yeah\nyeah did you I live in MO oh do you all\nright yeah done this twice okay I'm\ngoing I'll never come up here\n[Laughter]\nagain oh\nwell 38\n31 oh Jesus we're only 38k in yeah oh\nboy this shit's going to get\nreal sign huh one of course yeah it's\ncuz it's this is a different Road this\nis like a new Road\ncar\nback hopefully it's the last big climb\n7K 8K I don't know these are grueling\nnow we're on this beautiful\nrolling like sand nice though pretty\npacked this isn't\nbad this is quite clean just a slight\npoint of desperation for water I got\nenough but uh cam is short and we were\nanticipating a rest up it's probably\nliterally within a few kilometers but\nit's just hot as [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] anyways little\ntown I think we're MoGo is I don't know\nwhat town this is but it's a sign said\nMoGo anyway it's good to rest the feet\nin the\nback\noh yeah cool got nonalcoholic ice cold\nbeer I have one of those one\nroads\nso did not get to do a wrap up or end of\nday two I uh ended up kind of caretaking\na little bit and just focusing on\ngetting the group I was with to the\nFinish Line some people were kind of\nsuffering a bit and it felt more\nimportant to to do that than fill myself\nand fill my surroundings that being said\nyou know it this wasn't a race it was\njust a ride and it was quite enjoyable\nuh nonetheless I thought I'd kind of\ntalk about the whole of event I've never\ndone a two-day event it's always single\nday I was talking to somebody at the\nsort of C closing ceremony thing that I\nstayed for and uh he he said he was a\nbit crushed today said you can show up\nto a one-day event you know kind of do\nit uh without really thinking about it\nif you haven't trained but a two-day\nevent really eats you alive and I think\nthat that was true I today felt\nfantastic like this is not a a brag I\njust felt good I think I figured out how\nto use the Precision fuel I figured out\nhow to time it well and I started to\nkind of get into a great Rhythm I I just\nthought it was nice to kind of get out\nand uh you know just kind of be be in it\nI did spent like the first 30 you know\nper of that ride today by myself doing\nsome of the crusher climbs but I you\nknow I held in and I got got through\nthem I didn't you know got to put a foot\ndown but I mean I was able to get back\non and make it work so it was it was a\nbig day of just kind of push push I mean\n2,700 and something meters of climbing\nacross 908 I that's that's no joke and\nand yesterday was quite similar too so I\nthink in general you know as two-day\nevent goes you mean you know you signed\nup to get your ass handed to you and and\nit and it did that that's what the big\nrides were I don't know where I kind of\nfinished today but it felt like I came\nin first place you know it was the first\none in it did seem that way I I was\nriding by myself in wave one didn't see\nanybody else and and ended up losing\nsome people I think all in all you know\na lot of people were just you know kind\nof in you know kind of dealing with\nyesterday but you know that being said\npeople were riding hard today and and it\nwas you know it was there but the the\nSea of people at the end in the ceremony\nthere were a lot of just crushed people\nI guess as a wrap for the event um\nreally enjoyed it graer uh did a great\njob was a you know good Energy Group it\nwas really casual the vibe was good you\nknow the people that were there were all\nin it for the fun um you know it was\nquite social at the end I mean you know\nit might have been good to have more\nevents uh kind of in the downtime to\nkind of get more social up but you know\nthat being said day one to day two I\nended up kind of you know with the group\nthat I got to know again and they you\nknow chased me throughout the day and I\nchased them so you know it was you know\nall in all you kind of find your crew\nand I found one will I do it again\nabsolutely definitely plan to go to that\nevent again I really enjoyed it myself I\nknow Haley wants to go to it it was on\nher find that I went to it she was like\nyou know quite jealous and wanted to go\nherself but you know that's the where\nI'm at in my life now I think one of the\nthings that I haven't really divulged in\ngetting back you know into doing loud\nkid day again and filming myself kind of\ngoing through these rides and events is\nthat you know it was like six some seven\nyears ago that I lost my job and got a\njob well I'm inan that exact same window\nagain you know this time it's a little\ndifferent I'm in a little bit of a\ndifferent position I've learned a lot\nI'm a very different person to where I\nwas at before so you know all in all you\nknow I'm looking forward to the next\nchapter but yeah here I am again kind of\ntrying to figure out who I am and what I\nwant to do and what I want to be but you\nknow I also enjoy creating content and\ntelling stories you know one of the\nthings I'm doing now is star to tell\nsome stories again so it's been fun to\nget back at it and get out to some\nevents and kind of be a part of them and\ntry to tell some stories so yeah there's\nthere's a little bit of a a headline for\nyou if you were an Old Faithful and you\nwatched the last video about me telling\nyou I lost my job and got a job well\nthis time I've lost my job I haven't got\na job but I got a plan uh my plan is to\nto write a book I've got a bunch of\narticles on medium that I've written\nkind of kicked off my podcast again uh\nsomething that I did uh preo and kind of\nshut off during Co if you're interested\nin that stuff uh you know you can put it\nin the comments if you're I can Chuck\nsome links in there and you you know you\ncan go and check it out if that's\nsomething you're interested in do let me\nknow but that's kind of me I just\nthought i' i' do a bit of a wrap up\nwhile I drive the car home um shout out\nto John no one's going to know who this\nis who who provideed the camping site\nthat place was dope it's a cool spot\nI'll put the links in the description to\nuh booking on his particular property\nthe Pub's been completely redone from\nthe last time I bought a stubby holder\nfrom that joint very cool great food\nreally cool staff that's in there it's\nit's on the up old eligent apparently\nthere's a whole festival out there so\nthis is the wrap up this is the two-day\nuh surprised myself pumped about the\nriding if you watched this far thank you",

Over 180 riders smashed out the 35 km, 55 km, and 100 km courses before rolling into the beer garden for a cold one under the Maxxis arch.\n\nWe wrapped up with podium prizes, fresh Maxxis Gravel tyres, and Sunday’s social ride to finish the weekend strong.\nHuge thanks to the Graveleur crew for another epic event stoked to be part of this growing gravel community.",
