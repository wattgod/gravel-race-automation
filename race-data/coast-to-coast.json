          "transcript": "Every summer, several hundred cyclists\nparticipate in Michigan's Coast to Coast\nGravel Grinder, a 204 mile\npoint-to-point race from Agree to\nLetington. Most riders attempt it solo,\nbut there is a relay option, which\nseemed like a good opportunity for my\nwife to ride her first Century ever and\ngive me a solid training ride, working\ntowards my own riding goals later this\nyear.\n[Music]\nLet's do a 5second one.\n&gt;&gt; I'm going to do\n&gt;&gt; 5 4 3 2 1.\n&gt;&gt; The race is split into four legs, each\nroughly 50 m. Melissa and I decided that\nshe would ride the first half and I\nwould finish from there, which played to\nour strengths and riding preferences.\n&gt;&gt; Get it, girl.\n&gt;&gt; Because the first stretch of the route\nhas some tight sections, it's\nessentially a neutral roll out to keep\nan easy pace and avoid any unnecessary\nearly crashes.\n&gt;&gt; You're coming through on your right.\n&gt;&gt; Go, go, go.\n&gt;&gt; From there, the course opens up and the\npace ramps up to cruising speed.\ncovering generally flat gravel on the\nway to Gladwin. This gives riders the\nchance to team up for arrow advantages\nthat will get everyone to the finish\nfaster.\nHorse is already a bottle graveyard.\nHeadwind is a bit nasty,\nbut no sun and it's still fairly cool.\nI'm appreciating your draft for a bit.\n&gt;&gt; Oh man.\nOkay.\n&gt;&gt; Seat belt is\n&gt;&gt; Oh,\nso you do the relay, right?\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah, I'm glad they offer that\noption.\nEasier than\nfighting off the whole 200.\n&gt;&gt; You're smarter than me.\n&gt;&gt; A, you got this.\n&gt;&gt; Well, I followed this little gym up with\na oatmeal cinnamon bar that was much\nmore delicious.\nAs John knows, I get really cranky when\nI'm hungry.\nAnd that slim gym did not put me in a\nbetter mood. The cinnamon oatmeal did.\nFunny thing is\nabout 20 more miles. I'll be excited\nabout the swim gyms, I'm sure.\nand turn the camera on not because\nthere's anything exciting. But because\nthis is excessively boring,\nstraight, nice temple. 11 miles till the\nnext turn.\nIt is glorious.\nFeel like I can move a little more.\nThey'll catch me when they start\nclimbing.\nRight.\nGet my average face up right.\nI am already daydreaming about\nfirst stop.\nMy butt hurts. My butt hurts. My butt\nhurts cuz I forgot\nshimmy cream.\nI'm not going crazy. You're going crazy.\nI'm done.\n&gt;&gt; For context, this was in the middle of\nan 11mi straight section. So mindn\nnumbingly boring.\n&gt;&gt; Here's the turn. 11 miles later.\ngroup kind of broke up. Couple people\nfell off the back. Couple people going a\nlittle too fast for me. Slowing down a\nbit trying to ride my race.\nCan tell I'm lonely when I turn the\ncamera on.\nI think 12 to 13 is kind of my happy\npoint. So far today, if I start pushing\nfaster, starting to get pretty winded,\nI'm feeling good.\nVery much looking forward to seeing John\nby 8 miles.\nNot every day I burn 2,000 calories at\n9:30 in the morning.\nReally hope\nJohn edits out all my groans from\nreadjusting my seat.\nOne place\ncity limit.\nYou know what that means?\nSnacks.\nSnacks. Snacks. Snacks. Snacks.\n&gt;&gt; What a nice morning.\n&gt;&gt; Bars. Slim gyms.\n&gt;&gt; Do you have one of your big slim gyms?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. If you have an\n&gt;&gt; I didn't expect you to eat any slim\ngyms.\n&gt;&gt; Oh, they're so disgusting. So gross.\n&gt;&gt; So gross.\n&gt;&gt; So\neating your food and complaining about\nit.\n&gt;&gt; I That's what I'm laughing at because I\nactually enjoy those and I plan on\neating those myself today and here you\nare choking it now.\n&gt;&gt; If they're working for you, keep at it.\nYou're making really good time\n&gt;&gt; despite the timing lady saying there are\nonly like 19 riders left out there.\n&gt;&gt; Bethany is following you. She's enjoying\nwatching your progress. Lily says you\ncan do this queen or something. We got\nthis queen.\nYou're\n&gt;&gt; get some shots of the pit.\n&gt;&gt; That's what I'm doing.\nI've never felt more attractive.\n&gt;&gt; Doing great.\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\n&gt;&gt; All right. See you guys later.\n&gt;&gt; Have fun. Cheers. Keep it up. You're\ndoing great.\nThat's been all this morning so far. And\nall of a sudden, just gone.\nJust clear skies and full sunlight.\nSun came out.\nMaybe I should have grabbed some\nsunscreen.\nOh well.\nThis is really pretty.\n&gt;&gt; I feel so fast on the downhills.\n&gt;&gt; And then I start climbing again.\n&gt;&gt; Then it gets flatter uphill and it's\ndifferent.\n&gt;&gt; I'm like, \"Oh, I'm not as fast as I\nthought I was.\nDoing a lot of climbing\nso far. Just nice rolling hills.\nDefinitely taking down my average speed,\nthough.\n63 miles in. Almost to my second longest\nride. Legs are tired,\nbut\nmoving steady. This looks like a good\nspot for ras bar.\nShoot.\n&gt;&gt; Oh, thank you.\nprobably.\nTo get it open.\nNow that\nis delicious.\nEven after being dropped on the road.\nDon't really have anything to say or\nshow, but footage is footage. Lots of\nhills.\nIs that a downhill?\nthe head.\nI am really working to eat or drink.\nThis does not seem like it should be\nthis much work.\nI won't give up. No, I won't keep till\nI've reached the end and then I'll start\nagain.\nI want to try everything. I want to try\neven.\n&gt;&gt; All right. One puddle stroke at a time.\nYou go, girl.\nLook at all the daisies.\nLook at the soft sand.\nIt was averaging between 12 and 13\nearlier.\nNow it's like 8 to 10 miles an hour if\nI'm moving.\nLess if I'm climbing. But forward\nprogress, that's what matters.\nNo, this is getting cramps of vibes.\nAnother hill after another hill.\nGirls be like, I needed this. And it's\njust relatively flat road with no\nOh, look at this smooth black top.\nYes, please.\nI am ready to be done riding.\nStill got about 2 and 1/2 hours to go,\nthough. 73.7\nmiles in.\nOh, my virtual partner finished. Well,\ngood for them. All right, this is the\nhigh point.\nDoesn't mean climbing's done, but\noverall should be downhill.\nAll right, 84 miles in, about 20 to go.\nGiving myself all kinds of pep talks. I\nam so tired. But I can do this. I can do\nthis. Just got to give my race plate to\nJohn and I can lay down and take a nap.\n&gt;&gt; Meanwhile,\nI can do this. I've gone for 20 mile\nrides before.\nThis is when it's not about riding\nbecause it's fun. It's about riding cuz\nit's satisfying. Know you can do more\nthan you think you can. Push yourself\njust a little further. Kind of amazing\nhow dusty this is. I know my legs can do\nBut I am very done. I just want to stop\nso bad. But I'm close enough to the\ncutoff that I just got to keep moving.\nI am\non a struggle bus. Still got about 8\nmiles to go and that time just feels\ninsurmountable right now.\nSun is hot. Legs are tired. All right,\nI've ridden 100. What's three more?\nfirst century down\nand possibly my last. I can see it. I\ncan see the finish. Well, my finish\nabout the start\nright around this corner and then up the\nhill right there. So close.\nHurry up, cars. Hurry up. Hurry up. I'm\nturning in. Nope. Don't slow down for\nme. No. No, go. Please go, go, go.\nThank you.\nOh, I see my handsome husband. Don't\neven have half a bean left to give it\nits finish.\nThat's embarrassing.\n&gt;&gt; I have no beans left. You have used them\nall. Well done.\n&gt;&gt; I'm so proud of you, babe.\n&gt;&gt; Thanks.\n&gt;&gt; You have killed it today.\n&gt;&gt; I did it.\n&gt;&gt; Nice work.\n&gt;&gt; I have saved my ride. Now I can die in\nI am so confused.\n&gt;&gt; I believe it.\n&gt;&gt; Everything hurts.\nYou might want to scooch a touch to your\nright.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Can I do anything for you?\n&gt;&gt; Just swap race plates and get out there.\n&gt;&gt; Pizza is on the dashboard. Chocolate\nmilk is in the cooler. Need race plate.\n&gt;&gt; I have been dreaming about doing this\nfor the last 20 miles.\n&gt;&gt; Lying down.\n&gt;&gt; Lying down. Uhhuh.\n&gt;&gt; Oh, thank you. I I appreciate that.\n&gt;&gt; You're welcome.\n&gt;&gt; I'll give it my darnest.\n&gt;&gt; Where's your helmet?\n&gt;&gt; I need to find mine.\nTag.\n&gt;&gt; I met.\n&gt;&gt; Good luck.\n&gt;&gt; You're okay.\n&gt;&gt; I'm fine.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Well done, babe.\n&gt;&gt; I'll see you in 65, 70 mi, wherever Big\nM is. Ta.\nI'm about 3 miles into my legs. It's a\nlot sunnier than it was this morning,\nthat's how it goes.\nAnd this is why I want to ride leg\nthree. Although the sand is surprisingly\nsucky. Oh, I think I see somebody else\nhere.\nTurns out what I thought was another\ncyclist was a trash can.\nOkay, that is a cyclist. It's either\nthat or a horse, but it is a person on a\nbike. I repeat, a person on a bike\ndoing all right.\n&gt;&gt; I'm hanging in.\n&gt;&gt; Good deal.\n&gt;&gt; Pushing.\n&gt;&gt; Keep it up.\n&gt;&gt; Onto a seasonal road.\nAll right, this should be more\ninteresting.\nWe have found sand,\nwhich is more interesting.\nIt's also slower.\nMy goal is fast as century, which may be\nkind of stupid with all the elevation\nand sandy to track, but I also think I'm\nthe most fit that I've been. And I have\nbetter motivation than just casual\ncentury around home. So, we'll try.\nRegardless of speed outcome, this is a\nteam effort with my wife, and I love\nbeing part of that team. I'm so proud of\nher. She crushed her century, even if it\nkind of crushed her, too. So, she met\nher goal today. Now, I got to hold up my\nend.\nMan,\nthis is a very tempting stop sign to\njust roll through and get splatted,\nbut that would be dumb\nand irresponsible and reckless.\nNot to say counterproductive.\nThe goal is to finish,\nnot die.\nOoh,\ntwo cyclists.\nTwo for one special.\nThis is not my normal attitude.\nGravel John is a different animal.\nFireball.\nNice work.\n&gt;&gt; Respect the resilience.\nKeep it up.\nFun wash out.\nThat got a little loose.\nI think I'm turning this into a game of\nhow many exhausted double century riders\ncan John catch in his century. This\none's going to be six. Coast to coast\nriders. Water ahead.\nH. Heck yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Thank you. That one was worth a second.\n&gt;&gt; Oh, for sure. This is awesome.\nThank you so much.\n&gt;&gt; Have a lovely day. Okay, that was\nawesome. I know I didn't really need it,\nbut I will take water when I can get it.\nNice work, man.\nWhite Pine Trail.\nSit up. Breathe.\nSnack.\nOh, it turned off.\nBike touring habits are hard to break.\nNeeded a picture of that turtle\nturning onto a no outlet road.\nWe must be getting to the good stuff.\nHere we go.\nOoh, cyclist. Catch him.\nHowdy.\n&gt;&gt; Doing all right. How are you\n&gt;&gt; doing? Great.\nIt's pretty interesting to see the one\nstrip on the right where like everybody\nhas ridden. These are open roads, but\nit's still really interesting to see.\nLooking good.\nLet's make a night. You won't remember.\nI'll be the one. You won't forget.\n&gt;&gt; You all right?\n&gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Okay. just got done solit.\n&gt;&gt; Excellent.\nMan, look at that dust.\nDon't breathe this.\nAha!\nCyclist top of the hill.\n&gt;&gt; Looking good. Oh, this might be Clay\nHill Church say. I\n&gt;&gt; was going to say it's got to be about\nhere, right\nhandlebars\n&gt;&gt; back at it.\nAnd there were a bunch of people stopped\nthere.\nA nice little stop. And we are on to\ntrack after like five miles of chip\nseal.\nThis is fun stuff.\nYou doing all right?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. I'm just going to have to\nGood luck.\nI don't know how fast I want to go\nthrough here cuz I have no idea when\nthat stuff is going to show up.\ncome on. Come on.\nLove the knobbies. Knobbies get\ntraction.\nAll right.\nBoy, is this pretty.\nOkay, made it pretty far. Oh, we're off\nthe bike anyway, so it's next time.\nOh, look at that sand.\nMomentum is your friend.\n&gt;&gt; How are you?\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great. How about you?\n&gt;&gt; Good.\n&gt;&gt; Hanging in there.\n&gt;&gt; Uh-oh.\n&gt;&gt; I thought I'd get farther than that.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n&gt;&gt; that's a lot softer than I expected.\nBread and butter, baby. Bread and\nbutter. Roots and sand.\nPedal. Pedal.\nThere you go.\nNice work,\nyou guys. All right. Thank you.\n&gt;&gt; Awesome. Keep it up.\nenjoying your ride.\n&gt;&gt; I hiked a couple of bits. Good luck,\nman. Keep it up. You are good.\n&gt;&gt; I'm following you.\n&gt;&gt; Oh, that works.\n&gt;&gt; How long until the checkpoint?\n&gt;&gt; Um, another\n13 14 miles. I'm John, by the way.\n&gt;&gt; Conor.\n&gt;&gt; Connor, it's nice to meet you.\n&gt;&gt; I was going to make it to the\ncheckpoint.\n&gt;&gt; Your crew waiting with the battery\n&gt;&gt; I'll charge you in the car real quick.\n&gt;&gt; Oh, okay.\nEarly enough that you got the time.\n&gt;&gt; Left here where those came out.\ncuz you might drop me here in a second.\n&gt;&gt; keeping up better than anybody else I\nfound today. I just can't help but push\na little bit cuz this sounds really\ncocky. I'm sorry, but 100 miles is\ntraining ride for me.\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n&gt;&gt; I'm working towards the crusher and\nthat's going to be a 205 mile day or so.\n&gt;&gt; Jeez. probably take 27 28 hours.\n&gt;&gt; We'll get out of here. I'll find someone\nelse.\n&gt;&gt; Oh, this this is what I've got\nbefore I just take off. Do you have Q\ncards?\n&gt;&gt; What What are we at right now?\n&gt;&gt; Um\nthe next turn is Stronach Dam Road.\n&gt;&gt; You're welcome. Feel a little bad about\ndropping Connor, but I'm riding my race.\nAnd I'm feeling pretty good today.\nAs much as it was a treat to ride those\nForest Two Track trails, it's also a\ntreat to get back on some really nice\ngravel and just get back up to speed.\nFeeling good. Feeling fine.\nNice jersey. Doing all right.\n&gt;&gt; Good deal. Keep it up.\nEnjoying your ride?\nWe're past that part, huh?\nOh, keep it up. You're looking good.\nOh,\none, two, three, four riders.\nOh, yeah. Let's go. Let's get them.\nAlmost there.\ngood.\n&gt;&gt; Oh. Oh, that's so good.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\nThat's what brought me back to life.\n&gt;&gt; You look somewhat recovered.\nYeah. I stayed on the ground for about 5\nmore minutes and then I drank chocolate\nmilk and then drove here and by that\ntime I was recovered enough to\n&gt;&gt; Cool. I'm desperately trying to make up\nground on that last relay.\n&gt;&gt; I have no idea how fast they're going,\nbut there's a lot of ground to make up.\n&gt;&gt; Go get them.\n&gt;&gt; Working on it.\n&gt;&gt; It's all good. Good luck. Thank you.\n&gt;&gt; Love you.\nIf I scoot by on your left here.\nYeah. Thank you.\nHave a good ride,\nman.\nLike chipmunking this cheese bread. Too\ndry to actually swallow.\nShouldn't have taken food into a climb.\nThat was a mistake.\nNo way. It's still a massive puddle.\nThat's the puddle that was up to my\nwaist last year.\nThank you. I got one more close behind.\nEnjoy your ride.\nWe're good. We're good. We're good.\nOoh, I'll take a water.\nThank you. Appreciate you guys being out\n&gt;&gt; This is our favorite time of year.\n&gt;&gt; You guys give us\nremember every year free water.\n&gt;&gt; I'll keep that in mind. Thank you.\n&gt;&gt; Cheers.\nThat tail light ahead is taunting me.\nBeen able to see it for the last couple\nof miles. It's just outside my grasp.\nI hear your heartbeat to the beat of the\ndrums. Let's make the most of the night\nlike we're going to die young.\nokay. I got to pause that moon. I mean,\ncome on. How can I not? That's\nabsolutely gorgeous. All right, it's\nenough lolly gagging. I got a bike to\ncatch. Thwarted,\nslowed, hindered.\nThe light is escaping. All right, the\ngap is closing. I brought him in from\nabout 710 in like 5 miles. Making me\nwork for this.\n&gt;&gt; I have you now.\nGrip. Rip.\nIt's not worth the faces Melissa's\nmaking, but this is not tasting very\ngood right now.\nYou guys all right?\n&gt;&gt; Awesome. How are you?\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great.\n&gt;&gt; Almost done.\n&gt;&gt; Almost.\n92.\nI can see a blinky.\n&gt;&gt; Almost there.\n&gt;&gt; It's paved from here to the finish.\nFinal approach.\nAin't no stopping me. You know that I\ncan't be beat. You bring to me. Whoa.\n&gt;&gt; Come on. I can get one more.\nSo good together.\nLet's wrap this puppy up.\nWoo.\nTwo miles, baby.\nCandy.\nI'm what you want, not what you need.\nWoo!\nSweet as apple.\nI can't help\nbrighter than the star.\nWelcome to Michigan.\n&gt;&gt; Well done.\n&gt;&gt; my back is killing me.\n&gt;&gt; Sorry.\n&gt;&gt; I'm really happy though.\n&gt;&gt; Good. I'm really proud.\n&gt;&gt; I gave that\nall I had.\n&gt;&gt; You want to put your bike away first and\nthen get something to eat or just\n&gt;&gt; picture.\nWe got to get the dip picture. Job done.\nFirst century check. Fastest century\ncheck. Celebrating our anniversary by\ndoing a team event check. And after the\nceremonial wheel dip into Lake Michigan,\nit was time to load up the car and head\nfor home. H. This is a really long\nbeach.\n&gt;&gt; Why is it so long?\n&gt;&gt; All right. You want to check them?\n&gt;&gt; Oh, foot is wet.\n&gt;&gt; That's fine. I'm going to take these\nshoes off anyway.\n&gt;&gt; If you enjoy gravel riding or are\nlooking for your first double century,\nthis is a great event to ride. The 100m\nloop out of Letington and the 200 mile\ncoast to coast route both offer some\ngreat gravel that make it accessible for\nnewbies, as well as some spicy sections\nto keep the ride interesting. Between\nthe race team working hard to host and\nhow friendly other riders are, this\nevent is definitely worth adding to your\nrace schedule.",

I went down on the sand section maybe a dozen times 😂! We were 2-3 hours ahead of schedule before the 3rd section! We lost all the gains on that section. We did make it back to the last checkpoint before cutoff time but the three of us were so tired that we decided to DNF! Sam got in a bit earlier to checkpoint 3 and he went ahead and finished the race. Even though it was a tough route, we had a great time! The view from Au Gres to Ludington was incredible.\n\nThanks to Clint Phillips Samuel Bland and Todd Panciera for pushing me beyond my limits! Great riding with you guys! And congrats to the  Samuel Bland for making it to Lake Michigan!! 💪💪💪\n\nA big shout out to Bob Norcross for  being the best SAG crew ever!! He went above and beyond to take care of us!! Thanks Bob!!!! \n\nMy bike is beat up and I am beat up😃!  Time to recover and plot for the next adventure!",

The race splits into four legs of roughly 50 miles each. The course features generally flat gravel terrain with significant headwinds that riders describe as nasty. Key challenges include tight sections at the start requiring a neutral rollout, and an 11-mile straight section that riders find mind-numbingly boring. The route passes through Gladwin and includes areas where dropped bottles accumulate from the challenging headwind conditions. Riders report burning around 2,000 calories by mid-morning and recommend pacing around 12-13 mph for sustainable effort. The flat gravel sections allow for drafting opportunities where riders can team up for aerodynamic advantages."
