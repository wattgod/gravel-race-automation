Jake Rytlewski notes collegiate races \"can be short\" and recommends doubling up with category races to build training load - this distance hits the collegiate sweet spot. Similar distance to Crusher in the Tushar."

        "explanation": "4,921 feet over the course distance provides steady climbing without massive sustained efforts.

Similar elevation profile to Gravel Worlds."

March 7th in Turkey, Texas presents typical spring weather uncertainty - could range from 40 degrees with wind to 70 and perfect conditions. The Texas Panhandle's notorious wind can make or break races, adding tactical complexity without being consistently miserable. Similar climate challenges to SBT GRVL."

Pure prairie elevation that doesn't factor into race preparation. Lower altitude than Gravel Worlds — no thin-air concerns."

        "explanation": "Caprock Canyon's unique terrain will deliver scenery most collegiate riders haven't seen, but this inaugural event has no established traditions or legendary stories yet.

Elite-level competition, on par with Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

          "transcript": "all right grav wild Champs happened on\nthe weekend and wow oh wow do we have\nsome absolutely outrageous power data so\nmate morch won no power data\nunfortunately I didn't end up watching\nthe race but alas it doesn't really\nmatter cuz the numbers are so outrageous\nI just can't believe it so we're going\nto go through Ryder versus\nRyder well we might as well start with\nsecond place Blan\n373 normalized uh for 5 hours almost\n6,000 calories average power 330 what\nwhat it's just ridiculous and everyone's\nsaying oh gravel race are hard it's like\nyeah because on the road bike you just\nget big draft they never average 330\neven rube which is probably the most\nsimilar I'd say because it's like you\nknow you got a lot of hard like surfaces\nwhere there not a good draft but like\nthe thing that's different is like on\nthe flat here he's average 308 Watts cuz\nthey're only going 38k an hour like\nobviously that's quick I'm not saying\nit's not but for like a road race if it\nwas this hard they'd be like 50 so you\nget fat draft so that really is like for\nme at least quite a big thing first\nclimb 441 Watts stra has removed weight\nso I don't actually know how heavy these\npeople are like you can always Google\nhow much they are like for me it should\nbe about 75 would be my prediction again\n430 Watts here you can see like very\nspiky as\nwell but again more selections here 464\nfor 6 minutes like every climb is is\njust a lot of Watts at least over 450\nevery time again this climb here 480\nWatts what's really amazing though is\nlike when that lead selection uh was\nmade they just rolled through at like\nnormalized for an hour and a half and\nthen got and then these final climbs\nwere real real hard like so many KJS in\nlike way more KJ than you getting like a\nproper Road Race you can see so like 430\nWatts for like 6 minutes like it's just\ncrazy like this whole 9 Minute climb\nthey did um of 430 Watts obviously then\nwas The Descent as well and then it was\npretty much like even then 400 watts for\nthe last 2 minutes and the same with\nConor Swift like his numbers are almost\nmore outrageous 380 normalized 5 hours\njust bunkers um and again like you can\nsee here he's at he'd average 341 Watts\nagain you're all going to at me and go\nShimano py I go yeah but it's the best I\ncan do you know we we've got some scam\nones coming up as well but the scam boys\ndidn't do as well uh shiman 123 so you\nknow it is what it is but um again 454\nWatts here 480 normalized you can see\nthere's big spikes in corner Swiss power\ndata like really really big spikes again\nthis is a bit more steady 500 watts for\n6 and a half minutes um very very strong\nI mean that is that's a lot of wats here\nagain you know you can see big Power\nhere cracks out 522 Watts for a minute\nand a half um you know again it's just\nevery climb is really really Punchy um\nand then again in this bit here in in\nthe kind of one they're swapping off 330\nnormalized so it just really is like one\nof those ones where it just suits like\nsuch a well all guys so we can look at\nbalor's file Balor did well fifth\noverall um again he looked really good\ngood um and you can see 370 normalized\non this climb so a little bit less you\ncan see big spikes um we'll be\ninterested to see this first but here\nagain you know you can see only 27\nnormalized obviously he's lighter I\ndoubt he's what he was at like 62 he\ncould be like 64 65 but still like he's\ndoing not crazy amount of whats compared\nto the other guys he's obviously on a\nscam power meter so again this is like\nmore 260 average 300 normalized is\nyou're like okay that's that's less\ncrazy maybe the p is the Shimano p is\nread read too high you can see here\nthough he wasn't in that lead group\nthere I believe he own is only doing 256\nnormalized and that's really where the\nwhere the big difference was made um you\nknow if we just take this segment for\nexample you average 35 a half um and\nthese guys were doing 37.2 so you can\nsee that that's actually quite a big\ndifference and that's really why he\nwould save the wats the whats on the cin\nobviously less CU he weighs less but\nthat's really the difference uh he was\nwith Keegan Swinson then uh and Keegan\nSwinson's power data is actually really\nlow I don't really understand why um um\nI think he's heavyish I mean I don't\nthink he's he's definitely not 60 kilos\nbut here he is here um so again his\nnumbers not as crazy why didn't he do\nwell well ultimately he just doesn't\nhave a talent um he's obviously very\ngood at endurance racing but this is not\nan endurance race this is a Classics\nrace ridden Offroad technically he\nprobably is better than almost all of\nthem um you know the top guys he said B\ndropped him on the last clim but he he\ncaught him on the descend not surprising\num because you know he's he's an an ex\nexcellent mountain biker was a cross\ncountry mountain biker again see here\n260 normalized this is like not the same\nbut I think this race really suits W\nguys 5 hours not too long um real high\npower demands and also just rapid um and\nthen we can look at um moric again we\nalready saw so it is interesting in my\nopinion uh Keegan Swinson kind of\nlike how he is going\nuh maybe not as well as people thought\nhe would but at the end of the day still\na good ride from him uh but these boys\nwere just just on a different level um\nif we look at the actual actual\nresults uh we can we can have a have a\nlook at how everyone did because\nactually it was quite a bit of quite a\nbit thing Floren Vish con Swift valde\nKeegan Swinson Quinton Herman alasco\nWard I mean these guys sha Berger\nprobably the only Rogue one I'd say he's\nlike obviously strong but you know not a\nguy you'd expect to do that well\nnecessarily from the road but all these\nguys Demari wav alasco these are all big\nname as qu Quinton hman very good on the\nCy cost so yeah again super impressive\nsuper impressive wats um if we look at\nhis bike it's this new marid silax it's\ngot classic Cony Cony bars it looks like\nhe must have crashed you can see his\nleft knee here as well as a shifter bar\ncoming in running 5034\nddi2 um but yeah pretty pretty\nimpressive from these guys and it really\ngoes to show that their just numbers are\nabsolutely Bonkers um and uh yeah hard\nto get over how good they are so anyway\ncheers for watching hope you enjoy this\nvideo um and I'll see you in the next\none",

          "description": "GECKO's Turkey Cross 2014 (4Corners Cyclocross Race Series) Parelli Ranch, Pagosa Springs Saturday November, 29th \n\nCYCLOCROSS comes to Pagosa Springs this Holiday Season!\n\nCyclocross is a dynamic ad exciting form of bicycle racing and is usually held in the Fall and Winter months. The race course is generally short (between 1 and 2 miles) and competitors are required to complete as many laps as possible in the allowed time (generally 40 minutes to an hour). The courses have obstacles and varying terrain requiring the rider to often dismount and walk or run carrying their bike or navigating carefully through the technical sections. Although there are specific cyclocross bikes for this form of racing, many riders use modified mountain bikes or road bikes. \n\nFort Lewis College (FLC) has an established following of Cyclocross enthusiasts and the 4Corners Cyclocross Race Series (4CCX) continues to grow each year. In 2014 GECKO has joined this series adding two race events to their calendar. The 4CCX is now set in stone with seven races in the Four Corners area. There are three new venues that should provide some great racing action (Aztec has joined as well as Pagosa Springs). Cyclocross racers from around the region and the FLC Cycling Team will be doing battle against some of the toughest competition and challenging courses in the nation. Many of these racers, including FLC Cycling, will be honing their fitness and skills for the 2015 CX Nationals in Austin, TX, January 7-11, 2015. The race at FLC on December 13th is also going to be the Rocky Mountain Collegiate Cycling Conference Finals where the winners of the collegiate category will get called up to the front row at Nationals.\n\n\nDurango Performance Center 4Corners Cyclocross Race Series 2014 \n\nFor all Saturdays the schedule is as follows:\n\n11am: B Men (Cat.3/4), Open Women, 50+ Men – 40 minutes\n12noon: (Dolores 12:45) – A Men (Open Men), 35+ Men – 50 minutes\n\nVenue Details:\n\n11/8 Dolores, CO – Joe Rowell Park\n11/15 Aztec, NM – 711 N. Light Plant Road\n11/22 Fort Lewis College – Ray Denison Memorial Field\n11/29 Pagosa Springs, CO – Parelli Ranch, Pagosa Springs\n12/6 Cortez, CO – Parque da Vida, Cortez Rec Center\n12/13 Fort Lewis College – Ray Denison Memorial Field\n12/20 Pagosa Springs, CO – Parelli Ranch, Hwy 160\n12/21 Series Awards – Irish Embassy Pub, Durango\n\nThe Pagosa Springs events will be a fun morning for spectators and is held in most weather due to the nature of the riding, so make sure you add that to your Holiday calendars for things to take the family to (unless of course you’re also interested in cycling!).\n\nFor more information or to get on the CX mailing list contact Dave Hagen: hagen_d@fortlewis.edu or go to: http://cycling.fortlewis.edu/4ccx For further information on GECKO or GECKO events go to www.joingecko.org or email info@joingecko.org",
