Turkey, Texas remains a small town suddenly handling a national championship - expect growing pains despite the host organization's experience."

        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "The medium course runs approximately 50 miles according to Valley of Tears, though some sources list 62 miles. Jake Rytlewski notes collegiate races \"can be short\" and recommends doubling up with category races to build training load - this distance hits the collegiate sweet spot. Similar distance to Crusher in the Tushar."

      "technicality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "The course mixes gravel roads, old rail trail, and singletrack within Caprock Canyon State Park - unusual for gravel racing to include actual MTB sections. Pete Gossett warns his gravel setup \"doesn't like sand at all\" and carries a cleaning brush for sandy sections that clog the bottom bracket. Less technical than The Mid South."

        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "4,921 feet over the course distance provides steady climbing without massive sustained efforts. The Texas Panhandle's Caprock Canyon terrain delivers ups and downs that will separate riders without requiring specialized hill climbing preparation for collegiate racers. Similar elevation profile to Gravel Worlds."

        "explanation": "Historical weather data shows average highs of 78°F and lows of 51°F, with a 20% chance of rain on any given day, and gusts reaching 30 mph. March 7th in Turkey, Texas presents typical spring weather uncertainty - could range from 40 degrees with wind to 70 and perfect conditions. The Texas Panhandle's notorious wind can make or break races, adding tactical complexity without being consistently miserable. Similar climate challenges to SBT GRVL."
      },
      "altitude": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Turkey, Texas sits around 2,200 feet - irrelevant for altitude considerations. Sea level riders won't notice any performance difference, mountain riders get no advantage. Pure prairie elevation that doesn't factor into race preparation. Lower altitude than Gravel Worlds — no thin-air concerns."

      "adventure": {
        "score": 4,

      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Caprock Canyon's unique terrain will deliver scenery most collegiate riders haven't seen, but this inaugural event has no established traditions or legendary stories yet. Keith Tanner notes gravel positioning makes riders \"just a bit more comfortable\" - the terrain will reward that versatility."
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "The collegiate cycling community will target their first-ever gravel nationals opportunity.

        "score": 5,
        "explanation": "With a field of 200-400 collegiate riders, every serious collegiate gravel racer will target this race - it's the only place to win a national title in this discipline. Jake Rytlewski's competitive collegiate background shows the level of dedicated racers who've been \"waiting years for this opportunity\" to exist. Elite-level competition, on par with Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

      "value": {
        "score": 5,
        "explanation": "Racing for a national championship title that didn't exist before delivers massive opportunity-to-cost ratio for competitive collegiate riders. USA Cycling's expansion into collegiate gravel represents recognition of the discipline's growth - being part of that inaugural field has lasting value."

      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Registration runs $50-$75. Turkey, Texas requires flying into Lubbock or Amarillo and driving to reach the venue. March timing avoids peak season lodging rates, but options remain limited in a small town hosting a national championship. Plan on camping or driving from larger towns for accommodation. Similar expense level to Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

      "should_you_race": "If you're college-aged with decent fitness and want to claim bragging rights as the first-ever winner, this is your shot. The 62-mile mix of gravel roads, rail trail, and singletrack won't destroy you, but March in Texas means unpredictable weather and zero race history to guide your prep. Show up ready for anything because nobody knows what they're doing yet.",
