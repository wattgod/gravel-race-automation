        "explanation": "Valley of Tears is hosting with established gravel event infrastructure, but USA Cycling still lists 'more information coming' on basic championship logistics. Turkey, Texas remains a small town suddenly handling a national championship - expect growing pains despite the host organization's experience."
      },
      "length": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "The medium course runs approximately 50 miles according to Valley of Tears, though some sources list 62 miles. Jake Rytlewski notes collegiate races \"can be short\" and recommends doubling up with category races to build training load - this distance hits the collegiate sweet spot."
      },
      "technicality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "The course mixes gravel roads, old rail trail, and singletrack within Caprock Canyon State Park - unusual for gravel racing to include actual MTB sections. Pete Gossett warns his gravel setup \"doesn't like sand at all\" and carries a cleaning brush for sandy sections that clog the bottom bracket."
      },
      "elevation": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "4,921 feet over the course distance provides steady climbing without massive sustained efforts. The Texas Panhandle's Caprock Canyon terrain delivers ups and downs that will separate riders without requiring specialized hill climbing preparation for collegiate racers."
      },
      "climate": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "March 7th in Turkey, Texas presents typical spring weather uncertainty - could range from 40 degrees with wind to 70 and perfect conditions. The Texas Panhandle's notorious wind can make or break races, adding tactical complexity without being consistently miserable."
      },
      "altitude": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Turkey, Texas sits around 2,200 feet - irrelevant for altitude considerations. Sea level riders won't notice any performance difference, mountain riders get no advantage. Pure prairie elevation that doesn't factor into race preparation."
      },
      "adventure": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Racing through Caprock Canyon State Park delivers varied terrain most collegiate riders have never experienced. Pete Gossett calls his gravel setup \"absolutely the right bike for 80% of my riding\" when discussing diverse terrain challenges - this course provides that variety in spades."

      "prestige": {
        "score": 5,
        "explanation": "This inaugural USA Cycling Collegiate Gravel National Championships represents a \"significant expansion\" of USA Cycling's championship offerings, highlighted as an \"exciting addition\" to 2026's calendar alongside established nationals. First names in the history books of a new national title."
      },
      "race_quality": {
        "score": 5,
        "explanation": "USA Cycling's championship standards ensure proper execution when they stake their reputation on an event. Being hosted at an existing Valley of Tears event means the collegiate championship benefits from established event infrastructure and proven gravel racing operations."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Caprock Canyon's unique terrain will deliver scenery most collegiate riders haven't seen, but this inaugural event has no established traditions or legendary stories yet. Keith Tanner notes gravel positioning makes riders \"just a bit more comfortable\" - the terrain will reward that versatility."
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "The collegiate cycling community will target their first-ever gravel nationals opportunity. Hosting at Valley of Tears means benefiting from \"the broader gravel racing community atmosphere\" rather than starting from scratch - established event energy with new championship stakes."
      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 5,
        "explanation": "Every serious collegiate gravel racer will target this race - it's the only place to win a national title in this discipline. Jake Rytlewski's competitive collegiate background shows the level of dedicated racers who've been \"waiting years for this opportunity\" to exist."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 5,
        "explanation": "Racing for a national championship title that didn't exist before delivers massive opportunity-to-cost ratio for competitive collegiate riders. USA Cycling's expansion into collegiate gravel represents recognition of the discipline's growth - being part of that inaugural field has lasting value."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Turkey, Texas requires flying into Lubbock or Amarillo and driving to reach the venue. March timing avoids peak season lodging rates, but options remain limited in a small town hosting a national championship. Plan on camping or driving from larger towns for accommodation."
      }
    },
    "final_verdict": {
      "score": "69 / 100",
      "one_liner": "The inaugural collegiate nationals that trades established prestige for first-year chaos in the Texas panhandle.",
      "should_you_race": "If you're college-aged with decent fitness and want to claim bragging rights as the first-ever winner, this is your shot. The 62-mile mix of gravel roads, rail trail, and singletrack won't destroy you, but March in Texas means unpredictable weather and zero race history to guide your prep. Show up ready for anything because nobody knows what they're doing yet.",
      "alternatives": "Dirty Kanza offers the real gravel prestige without the growing pains, while Unbound Gravel 100 gives you similar distance with actual race infrastructure. If you want collegiate competition with established traditions, stick to cyclocross nationals where the chaos is intentional."
