        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Ken Carl experienced \"cool and perfect\" race day conditions \"under a perfect blue sky morning,\" while other reports confirm \"weather was about perfect, and the course was fast.\" Mid-June in Michigan typically delivers favorable racing conditions, though the agricultural setting means weather can significantly impact the farm sections and gravel road surfaces."

      "altitude": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Racing in Ionia, Michigan at approximately 650-700 feet above sea level means altitude is irrelevant to performance. The elevation profile focuses entirely on rolling terrain features rather than any meaningful altitude considerations for endurance racing."

        "explanation": "Ken Carl finished \"4th in my category\" and celebrated hearing \"teammates cheering and clapping as I neared the finish line,\" capturing the regional community focus.

The farm sections create competitive separation, but safety concerns and traffic management issues affect overall race execution quality."

        "explanation": "Ivy Audrain's crashes ended her competitive race, but she \"stopped at every aid station to drink beer and fireball with the volunteers\" and \"made friends with the moto officials\" who \"took a shot WITH ME AT THE LAST AID STATION.\" The event creates memorable experiences through volunteer enthusiasm and post-crash hospitality, though technical sections pose significant risks."

Free camping, professional photography from Rob Meendering, chip timing, and the post-race taco bar create significant value, while Ivy Audrain calls it \"a must-do\" despite her crashes."
