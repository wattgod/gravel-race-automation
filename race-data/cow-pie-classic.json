Ken Carl experienced \"cool and perfect\" race day conditions \"under a perfect blue sky morning,\" while other reports confirm \"weather was about perfect, and the course was fast.\" Mid-June in Michigan typically delivers favorable racing conditions, though the agricultural setting means weather can significantly impact the farm sections and gravel road surfaces. More weather exposure than Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."
