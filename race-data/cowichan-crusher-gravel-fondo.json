        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Elite rider Kai Vander Veen described \"the mixture of climbs and then descents made for a great race\" with roads in excellent condition. Course runs at least 75% gravel with challenging climbs, descents, and technical sections through Mosaic private property that organizers guard carefully."
      },
      "elevation": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Vander Veen's emphasis on \"climbs and then descents\" through Cowichan Valley's rolling hills suggests consistent elevation changes rather than one monster climb. The 4500 feet over 75 miles creates respectable climbing that tests gearing choices without breaking you."
      },
      "climate": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "2024 race saw \"a bit of rain but overall mostly cloudy\" conditions that elite rider Kai Vander Veen called \"great\" weather. Rain and showers held off until much later in the day, creating ideal conditions with gravel roads in good shape for the May/June timeframe."
      },
      "altitude": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Cowichan Valley sits near sea level on Vancouver Island – zero altitude considerations for training or race day strategy. Your biggest breathing concern is the guy drafting behind you, not oxygen debt from elevation."

      "adventure": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Course features \"diverse and stunning natural landscapes, including forests, rivers, lakes, and mountains\" plus passes by farms and vineyards through private Mosaic property. The 300+ participant field suggests the Vancouver Island backcountry delivers exploration beyond typical rail-trail monotony."
      },
      "prestige": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Record 300+ participants showed up for the 7th edition, demonstrating regional draw as \"Vancouver Island's Premier and Oldest Gravel Fondo.\" Part 1 of the Triple Crown of Gravel series gives it legitimacy, though repeat rider Vander Veen's third appearance suggests more local loyalty than international cache."
      },
      "race_quality": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Four distance options from 25km to 165km shows they understand different rider needs, and the Full Fondo Plus winner finishing in 5:15:36 suggests real terrain. They provide mechanical support, timed results, and actual aid stations instead of just water bottles on card tables. Solid execution for a regional event, nothing revolutionary."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Post-ride includes Okanagan Spring Beer Garden, Sapinos pizza, and souvenir socks at the Lower Ballfield finish. Elite rider Vander Veen returned for his third Crusher, suggesting the panoramic views through lush green trees and scenic valleys create repeat value beyond the usual gravel bonding experience."
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Vancouver Island cycling community shows up consistently for eight editions running, which says something about repeat value. Individual and team categories for both men and women keeps it inclusive without getting preachy about it. The beer garden and shared suffering create the usual gravel bonding experience."
      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "BC regional talent dominates the podium – Nieuwesteeg, Meier from Cumberland, Wright from Victoria. These are solid riders but we're not seeing international depth or pro team representation. The 5:15 winning time for 160km suggests decent competition, but this isn't where careers are made."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Registration includes mechanical support, timed results, souvenir socks, warm food, and cold beverages from Okanagan Spring Brewery. The record 300+ field suggests reasonable pricing for what's delivered. Early bird discounts before March 15th reward commitment over procrastination."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Organizers recommend \"any bike with fatter tires\" including gravel, cyclocross, mountain, hybrid, touring, or even road bikes and e-bikes, keeping equipment barriers low. Lake Cowichan isn't a tourist trap, though Vancouver Island ferry costs add geography overhead that's unavoidable."
