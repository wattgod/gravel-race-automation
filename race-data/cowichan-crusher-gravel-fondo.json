Longer than Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Vander Veen's emphasis on \"climbs and then descents\" through Cowichan Valley's rolling hills suggests consistent elevation changes rather than one monster climb. The 4500 feet over 75 miles creates respectable climbing that tests gearing choices without breaking you. Similar elevation profile to Gravel Worlds."

They provide mechanical support, timed results, and actual aid stations instead of just water bottles on card tables. Solid execution for a regional event, nothing revolutionary."

      "experience": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Post-ride includes Okanagan Spring Beer Garden, Sapinos pizza, and souvenir socks at the Lower Ballfield finish. Elite rider Vander Veen returned for his third Crusher, suggesting the panoramic views through lush green trees and scenic valleys create repeat value beyond the usual gravel bonding experience."
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Vancouver Island cycling community shows up consistently for eight editions running, which says something about repeat value. Individual and team categories for both men and women keeps it inclusive without getting preachy about it. The beer garden and shared suffering create the usual gravel bonding experience."

      "field_depth": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "BC regional talent dominates the podium – Nieuwesteeg, Meier from Cumberland, Wright from Victoria. These are solid riders but we're not seeing international depth or pro team representation. The 5:15 winning time for 160km suggests decent competition, but this isn't where careers are made. Less competitive depth than Almanzo 100."

      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Registration runs $70-110 CAD. Organizers recommend \"any bike with fatter tires\" including gravel, cyclocross, mountain, hybrid, touring, or even road bikes and e-bikes, keeping equipment barriers low. Lake Cowichan isn't a tourist trap, though Vancouver Island ferry costs add geography overhead that's unavoidable. Similar expense level to Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."
