More climbing than SBT GRVL at the same score."

Higher altitude racing, comparable to SBT GRVL."

        "explanation": "High alpine terrain delivers dramatic scenery shifts from lush Beaver Creek valleys to exposed Blue Ridge climbing.

        "explanation": "Field size of 350 riders suggests healthy participation, but competitive depth appears modest with sub-5 hour finishing times considered strong performances. The addition of untimed recreational categories and e-bikes indicates organizers are expanding participation rather than focusing on elite competition. Less competitive depth than Almanzo 100."

You get high-alpine terrain starting at 8,700 feet with nearly 2,000 feet of climbing on even the short course. Without knowing if this costs $75 or $175, it's a blind gamble on whether the Grand County gravel experience justifies the price tag."

          "description": "Ride along with me in the Crooked Gravel 2025 race through the beautiful high country of Winter Park, Colorado. This 67 mile course took us over miles of rugged gravel roads, forest trails, and big mountain climbs — all surrounded by stunning Rocky Mountain scenery.\n\nShot on my GoPro for a rider’s-eye view of the action — from the dusty pace lines to the thrilling descents and quiet stretches deep in the forest. Gravel racing combines endurance, skill, and adventure, and Winter Park delivered it all.\n\n📍 Event: Crooked Gravel 2025\n🚴 Location: Winter Park, Colorado\n🎥 Camera: GoPro HERO10\n\nIf you enjoy cycling, adventure, or just beautiful mountain scenery, hit Like and Subscribe for more ride-along videos from races and epic rides across Colorado.",
