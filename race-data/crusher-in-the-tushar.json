        "explanation": "At 70 miles, it's shorter than most premier gravel events. But those 70 miles are so packed with climbing that finishing times rival 100+ mile races. Winners take ~4 hours; mid-pack is 6-7 hours. The 'Half Crushed' (37mi) option exists for those not ready for the full beast."
      },
      "technicality": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "No singletrack, but the descents are genuinely technical—4,000ft of washboard switchbacks on 'The Big Drop' requires focus and skill. The climbs are steep (up to 15-20% pitches) with loose gravel. It's not BWR-level technical, but far from smooth gravel roads."
      },
      "elevation": {
        "score": 5,
        "explanation": "10,000+ feet of climbing in 70 miles is brutal by any standard. Two massive climbs—each topping 10,000ft elevation. The final climb (Col d'Crush) gains 2,700ft over 8 miles with pitches up to 20%. There's essentially no flat ground on the entire course."
      },
      "climate": {
        "score": 5,
        "explanation": "The 2017 race saw 100°F valleys and finish-line hail. July in the Tushars means hot mornings, brutal midday sun at altitude, and afternoon thunderstorms. The event explicitly warns of 'extreme changes in weather.' Pack for summer and winter in the same day."
      },
      "altitude": {
        "score": 5,
        "explanation": "The finish line sits at 10,400ft—possibly the highest gravel race finish in North America. You start at 5,900ft (the lowest point) and never go below that again. Expect 10%+ power loss if you're from sea level. Altitude sickness, cramping, and bonking are common."

      "logistics": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Beaver, Utah is remote—3 hours from Salt Lake City, 4+ from Vegas. Limited lodging in town (book early). The event is well-organized with shuttles and drop bags, but getting there requires planning. No personal support allowed on course."
      },
      "adventure": {
        "score": 5,
        "explanation": "A mountain-top finish at a ski resort. Views of the Tushar Mountains. The isolation of riding through Piute Valley. The contrast between baking valleys and alpine meadows. Finishing at 10,400ft after 10,000ft of climbing is genuinely epic."

      },

        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Well-organized with 5 aid stations, drop bag service, and shuttle support. The mid-race cutoff (mile 27 by 10am) is enforced for safety. Life Time took over in 2019 and maintains Burke's vision. Course marking is thorough but GPS backup recommended."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 5,
        "explanation": "You'll remember Crusher forever. The Col d'Crush final climb breaks people mentally and physically. The contrast of valley heat and alpine finish. The thousand-yard stare at the finish line. It's a bucket-list event for serious gravel racers."
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Smaller field (~600) creates intimacy. Serious athletes who know what they signed up for. The finish at Eagle Point has a party atmosphere with beer and food. Burke's presence and enthusiasm set the tone. Less 'festival' vibe than big races, more shared suffering."

        "explanation": "LTGP brings the best: Keegan Swenson, Peter Stetina, Haley Smith, Sofia Gomez Villafañe. The altitude and difficulty attract climbers and altitude-adapted athletes. Even age-group categories see strong performances—legends like Ned Overend and Tinker Juarez have raced."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "~$200 for a premium, well-supported event is reasonable. You get aid stations, shuttles, drop bags, a finisher belt buckle, and post-race party. The LTGP association adds legitimacy. The challenge itself is worth the price of admission."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Rural Utah isn't expensive, but it's remote. Limited hotel options in Beaver mean booking early or staying 30+ minutes away. Flights to Salt Lake City plus 3-hour drive add up. Budget $500-700 for travel/lodging on top of entry."

        "The scenery: Tushar Mountains are criminally underrated. World-class alpine beauty.",

      "consequences": [
        "Travel to Beaver, Utah takes effort. No direct flights. Budget for a road trip.",
        "Altitude adaptation requires 3-7 days minimum. That's vacation time or remote work.",
        "The descents will punish poor bike handling. Technical skills matter as much as fitness."
      ],
      "expectation_reset": "This isn't a gravel race you can 'just show up' to. The altitude and terrain demand specific preparation. A 12-week training plan with altitude simulation is table stakes for a respectable finish."
