The ride starts in Deerfield, Massachusetts and tackles some of the biggest paved and gravel climbs in the region. We rode the 180 km route (about 110 miles with 14,000 feet of elevation gain). The video includes our drive up with reflections on last year, a short shake-out ride the night before, full coverage of event day, and our reflections on the drive home.\n\nSpecial thanks\n• Franklin Land Trust: https://franklinlandtrust.org\n• NBX Bikes: https://nbxbikes.com\n• Rotation Engineering: https://rotation-engineering.com\n\nSee the rides on Strava\n• Adam’s ride: https://www.strava.com/activities/15562274606\n• Jon’s ride: https://www.strava.com/activities/15563376212\n\nJoin the IJAH community\n• Follow IJAH on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/itsjustahill\n• Join IJAH on Strava: https://www.strava.com/clubs/922291\n• Join the IJAH WhatsApp Chat: https://chat.whatsapp.com/KgldCnQRWmZKACuzM7LFHx\n• Join the IJAH Discord: https://discord.gg/6SVfyRhE\n• Follow Jon on Strava: https://www.strava.com/athletes/10241068\n\nFollow Adam\n• Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/bike_rhode_island\n• Strava: https://www.strava.com/athletes/23719315?oq=Adam\n\nWhat is D2R2?\nThe Deerfield Dirt Road Randonnee is a New England classic, known for brutally steep dirt and mixed-surface climbs, quiet farm roads, and big views.

My voice my I swear it's lower\nthan that.\n&gt;&gt; We're passing riders. Make sure to give\nriders, if you're watching this video,\nyou know, but make sure to give riders\nplenty of room. Oh, are we gonna have to\nput the things under jerseys again this\nyear?\n&gt;&gt; Oh, what what did we do? Bib numbers.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; No. Did we have to last year\n&gt;&gt; with pins?\n&gt;&gt; [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I hate pinning [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] to my jersey.\nNot to be so negative from the start.\nWe're We're going to register. It's\nFriday evening the night before D2R2.\nWe're in Deerfield, Mass. We're going to\nAshefield, Mass to sleep and to do a\nshakeout ride. But first, we're\nregistering. Well, we already\nregistered. We're picking up.\n&gt;&gt; We're signing in. Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And maybe that will include the numbers.\n&gt;&gt; I think so.\n&gt;&gt; Oh, we pinned them on in the room last\nyear.\n&gt;&gt; Last year we stayed at a sketch hotel.\n&gt;&gt; Oh, the Howard Johnson or whatever it\nwas. I\n&gt;&gt; think it was a Hojo. Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And Rich uh Rich also stayed there. We\nrode with Rich last year. You see the\nvideo. You should go and watch the last\nyear's video, the 2024 version, but now\nit's 2025. And Rich lives in Arizona\nnow.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. Things are a little different for\nAnd we were supposed to be up here with\nSeth Carlson, but he had a run in with a\nbeehive in a guard rail.\n&gt;&gt; He said quote unquote, \"My leg looks\nlike a sausage.\"\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, that's not good. And I think\nhis chain stay might or might\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. He said he cracked his frame or\nsomething maybe. Yeah. That's a rough\ngo.\n&gt;&gt; So,\n&gt;&gt; and he broke his finger like a month\nago.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.\n&gt;&gt; That was a rough go.\n&gt;&gt; So, Adam and I are going in. We're\nstaying here without Seth. Sorry, Seth.\nWe miss you. Wish you were here. Xoxo.\nBut we're gonna see some other people\nlike um I know Mike Cooney is doing it.\nDon Gilbert's up here. Uh David Kay is\nup here. We are half mile away and we're\ngonna Oh, Cole is there. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Cole's\ndoing the 200k though.\n&gt;&gt; The people that I mentioned are doing\nthe 100k. That's what I mean. 180k.\nThat's what we're doing. 180k and it is\n14,000 ft of climbing, 111 miles. And\nlast year we did it in 8 hours and 15\nminutes. And Adam, how you feeling?\n&gt;&gt; I am feeling good. I'm a fitness wise\nI'm feeling good. Little nervous about\nmy knee. Uh, seeing if that's going to\nact up or not. I got ibuprofen in my\nframe bag ready to go.\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n&gt;&gt; The weather looks great. I mean, it's\nfreaking Every time I come up here, man,\nwe so pretty up here.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's gorgeous. And it's all, you\nknow, this ride supports the Franklin\nLand Trust, which is all, you know, land\nthat's bought up so that it isn't overly\ndeveloped. And there are a lot of farms\nin the area. We're driving through corn\nfields. And\n&gt;&gt; dude, look at this. I'm whipping around\nto a farm. And\n&gt;&gt; this happened last year. Remember it\nsaid we were there. We\n&gt;&gt; were and then we just intersection of a\nroad and it was like on the right.\n&gt;&gt; I remember that there's someone with a\nbike on the back of their car.\n&gt;&gt; Just follow them.\n&gt;&gt; I drive slowly though, so that's the\nproblem.\n&gt;&gt; Tomorrow, what time we plan on starting?\n6 a.m., right?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. 6 a.m. start. I think we're going\nto need it.\n&gt;&gt; Bikes and road.\n&gt;&gt; Sorry. Would like to figure 8 hours of\nride time tomorrow would be nice.\nProbably 10 hours total or so. Going to\nenjoy that lunch stop. Spoiler. Lunch\nstop was really good last year.\n&gt;&gt; Great lunch stop. So,\n&gt;&gt; hope to hit that again.\n&gt;&gt; That's what you have to look forward to.\nShake out ride tonight. Pasta. I brought\nsome Pop-Tarts and some oatmeal.\n&gt;&gt; Hope to be in bed by a reasonable time.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n&gt;&gt; 9 or 10:00. It's almost 6:00 now. We're\ngoing to sign in. We're going to ride.\nWe're going to eat. So, probably\nprobably around 9, I guess.\n&gt;&gt; Staying like 20 minutes away, so it'll\nbe easy to get here in the morning.\n&gt;&gt; Right. Wow. We're pulling up. Beautiful\nfarm. Lots of things growing. Portag\nJohn up on a trailer. Big tent.\n&gt;&gt; Hopefully Cole's here. Does he drive a\nVolkswagen? Where does he drive?\n&gt;&gt; Don't put me on the spot like this,\ndude.\n&gt;&gt; Cuz I should know.\n&gt;&gt; Do you even know him?\n&gt;&gt; I Yeah, I know him. We bike packed with\nhim,\n&gt;&gt; didn't we?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think so. What was his name?\n&gt;&gt; Cole Callahan.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, something like that.\n&gt;&gt; All right, we're just going to park and\nsign in. And I think I've said that\nthree times now, but that's it. We're\njust going to park and sign in.\n&gt;&gt; We're going to sign in. All right, this\npart will be edited out of the video.\nThis is boring.\nHeat.\nHeat. Heat.\nOkay, we're here. It's the next morning.\nWe had a nice shakeout ride. Okay, so\nthis is really trying to get good light\non me. Okay, so we heard that someone\ngot clotheslined with with one of these\nthings. You can see this right here.\nIt's like this twine to separate\nparking. Someone rode their bike into it\nlast night, I guess. So, if that was\nyou, I'm sorry. But then we also just\nsaw a guy almost walk into it. Well,\npretty much did walk into\n&gt;&gt; short of these. Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; You cannot see that at all.\n&gt;&gt; All right. Where's Cole? Let's find\nCole.\nSee you.\n&gt;&gt; 5:30 starting in half an hour. It's\npretty cold. Just ate some breakfast.\nGot to get the bikes ready now. And uh\nyeah, see we're coming now. Trying to\nget close line by that.\n&gt;&gt; I love the setup. I like the purple\nmatching bottles.\n&gt;&gt; It's a good touch.\n&gt;&gt; I don't know if that was Is that\nintentional? I mean, it must be, right?\n&gt;&gt; I just like the color.\n&gt;&gt; All right, mile zero. 110 or so to go.\nThere's your closeup, dude. Oh, yeah.\nIt's perfect. It's perfect. Yeah.\nThanks, Simon. He's going to kill me\ntoday. Great jersey.\n&gt;&gt; I think we're going to rank today.\nJersey,\n&gt;&gt; I think. So,\n&gt;&gt; 10 out of 10.\n&gt;&gt; All right. What's the advice, guys?\nI don't know. Keep riding.\n[Applause]\nSo far so good. Even though I did drop\nmy camera like a fool. Just over six\nmiles in now. Reed's Bridge Road.\nDude,\n&gt;&gt; already dropped his camera.\n&gt;&gt; 20 minutes into it. I already dropped\nthe GoPro.\nDownhill. Finally.\nHeat\nup here.\nAll right, so far so good. Just under 20\nmiles in over in Ashefield.\n&gt;&gt; Nutella tastes like it's on rye bread,\nwhich is an interesting choice, but it's\ngood.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they get a whole spread.\n&gt;&gt; A ton of stuff here.\n&gt;&gt; Where the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] are we? Crashfield.\n&gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. Yeah, cuz we you know that was\nlike\n&gt;&gt; 2 minutes down the road.\nI remember this.\nI remember this being wild.\nOh, this is steep.\nDefinitely remember this from last year.\nThis is insane.\nFour brakes.\nHoly crap. That was like 2 and 1/2\nmiles.\nJust did the East Road descent. East\nRoad Descent. Was [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] gnarly. I lost\nthe bottle. Some really nice guy was\nbehind me picked it up for me. But I\ndidn't realize until the bottom and\nboom, he was there. Adam had his [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]\nGoPro in his mouth that whole descent.\nMad man.\n&gt;&gt; So, we kind of just rode Thunder\nMountain on our gravel bike, so we don't\nhave to, you know, tell anyone the\ncaveat of we didn't go on a single\ntrail. What?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we were just talking about\n&gt;&gt; that descent had to be like the coolest\nfreaking descent.\nThis is a hill.\n300 watts just to stay moving up this\nentire thing. Heat. Heat.\nAlmost 40 miles\nSecond checkpoint.\n&gt;&gt; Hey, how's it going?\n&gt;&gt; We are in Heath.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, you are.\nWhere'd you go to next? Do you know what\ntime?\n&gt;&gt; Oh boy. No,\n&gt;&gt; we don't have a root map. It's like And\nthis is our first year, so we we really\ndon't know that much.\n&gt;&gt; I can see much. I just don't know how\nfar.\n&gt;&gt; We appreciate you doing this.\n&gt;&gt; Oh, you're welcome.\n&gt;&gt; Yo, we just saw a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] bear.\nWe just saw a black bear run right in\nfront of us.\nLiterally on the drive up here\nyesterday, we were saying, well, I was\nsaying I've never seen a bear. There was\na bobcat in my yard recently, but black\nbear cooking across the trail.\nI couldn't pull my camera out in time,\nbut we just saw a bear run across the\nroad in front of us, probably 30 yards\nahead. Pretty cool. Haven't seen one in\na really, really long time. But John was\njust saying this morning that he's never\nseen one out in the wild.\nYou remember that guy at Overland? What\ndo you say? What goes down must come up.\n&gt;&gt; What goes down must go up.\n&gt;&gt; Must go up before a massive hill. Kind\nof thinking of him right now.\n&gt;&gt; Dude, this is steep. Oh my god. Well,\nAdam was just talking about steep. I\ntotally spun out. How am I supposed to\nstart back up? I definitely think this\nis the one I spun out on last year. If\nthere's a driveway up here to the left,\nyou know, you might say to yourself,\n\"Well, John, you're walking.\"\nIt's not easy. This walking shoot ain't\neasy.\nSo John's running a big train ring and\nhe slipped out. I don't even think you\ncan clip in back on this hill. It's\nalmost over. But 20% on straight dirt\nroad. It's hard.\nDefinitely the same hill.\nMade the same mistake.\ntook a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] line, spun the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out.\nWhoa.\nI'm sorry for you if you live on this\ndirt road in the winter time. Holy crap,\nthat is steep, folks.\nClear\ndown.\nLet's go.\nAll right, we're officially in Vermont.\nBut yeah, weird. It kind of looks like\nwhere we just were. Funny how that\nworks.\nOh yeah.\nWow.\nThis dirt road here is like better than\npavement.\nThere was a descent back there. We must\nhave hit like 50 m an hour and it was so\nsmooth.\nOkay, thank you.\n&gt;&gt; All right, this is the lunchtop. This is\nwhat it's all about. This kind of rules.\nThat one is so\n&gt;&gt; I think what is good is to put it.\n&gt;&gt; I feel like I had a lot more energy at\nthis time last year. I think I'm I think\nI was way more fit last year.\n&gt;&gt; That doesn't even seem possible. You're\nvery fit now.\n&gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. If I wasn't more fit, I\ndefinitely was 10 lbs lighter. But hey,\nwe're over halfway done. And lunch was\ngreat.\n&gt;&gt; And there are bikes everywhere.\n&gt;&gt; We're halfway\npost. Let's do it.\nJust after the big lunch rest stop,\nwe got a category 4 climb. 084 miles,\n449 ft.\nWe're going up up up. I climb 18 of 30.\nOh boy.\nI'm struggling. It's a dark moment. Got\nlike 40 miles left and like 4,500 ft.\nJust got a really nice text from\nJocelyn. That was encouraging, but not\nin a good place right now. Got at least\nthree hours left, if not four. I'm\ndragging ass. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]\nCar up.\nGreat shot. I'll just meet you. This is\na great one.\nSuper nice.\nSuper cooked.\nHung climb 22 of 30 right now. Sick\nview.\nAdam's being an absolute bench and\nwaiting for me at the top every hill.\nNot my best day. Cramped twice. First\ntime was right before the lunch stop.\nSecond time was a second climb after the\nlunch stop. 33.3\nmiles left with 3,400 ft of climbing.\nBut right now, all I feel is why why?\n&gt;&gt; All right, we got Patent Hill coming up.\nIt's like over 800 feet and a little\nover a mile, maybe a mile quarter.\n95 miles in. That is not what I want to\nhit right now.\n[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Just climbed Pan Hill. The last\nbig boy of the day. This is the first\ntime I've seen less than an average of\n100 ft per mile. 13 and 12 miles left.\n1,000 ft.\nJust got done that crappy hill. Last\nrest stop.\nHome stretch. Now\n&gt;&gt; you know what they say? They say misery\nloves company.\nSo, it's so nice to do this with you,\nAdam. But what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]\n&gt;&gt; Oh, that was terrible.\n&gt;&gt; Why?\n&gt;&gt; We did this last year and probably felt\nthis way last year and then we're like,\n\"No, let's do it again.\"\n&gt;&gt; In two days, I'm going to be like, \"Oh,\nthat was great. I can't wait for next\nyear.\"\n&gt;&gt; It's amazing.\n&gt;&gt; We have to take two days off the bike.\n&gt;&gt; I know. For real. Rare for me.\n&gt;&gt; Holy crap.\nNice.\nHey,\nthank you. See you guys, too.\nDo we cry now or do we\n&gt;&gt; I probably teared up a little bit when I\nwas like this is a bad moment for me. Uh\nbut yeah, you can cry now if you want.\nNow it's the time to be\n&gt;&gt; I am crying if you can't see.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's why you put the\n&gt;&gt; That's why we're aviators.\n&gt;&gt; That's why we're reflective glasses.\nThere's always tears in my eyes. Well,\nwe did it again. And unlike last year,\nyou don't have your What is it? Bob and\nDavid. No, the massage gun.\n&gt;&gt; Bob and Brad.\n&gt;&gt; That thing's waiting at home for me\nright now, though. I'm going to call\nSarah and tell her.\n&gt;&gt; That's good.\n&gt;&gt; Make sure Bob and Brad are ready for me.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, yeah, we did it. Uh 180 km,\n110 miles, 14,000 ft of climbing.\nA little bit slower than last year.\nProbably my fault, Adam. I'm sorry.\n&gt;&gt; That's good. We were in that What was\nit? 20 something minutes. I got like a\n40 something.\n&gt;&gt; My ride hasn't even uploaded yet. So, I\nmean, we can we'll put them in the\nYouTube description. We'll throw them up\non this\n&gt;&gt; screen right here.\n&gt;&gt; It was hard. No matter how you caught\nit, it was hard.\n&gt;&gt; It was hot. Hotter. Not hotter than last\nyear, but just like, you know, it ended\nup getting a little bit hotter.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. Probably hotter than I expected it\nto get.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. Hotter than I expected, but it was\nnice. Good support, good rest stops. We\nsaw a bear. We saw a freaking bear.\n&gt;&gt; We saw a bear. That was sick. We saw a\nlot of people.\n&gt;&gt; We had a weird encounter. Maybe tried to\nget murdered. I don't know.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, let's talk about that. So, this is\naround mile 502.\n&gt;&gt; 52.\n&gt;&gt; We were supposed to We were taking a\nleft\n&gt;&gt; like after going through like a little\nvillage or whatever. We're sort of\nescaping the village.\n&gt;&gt; It was where the two routes merged. So,\nwe saw people coming up the road ahead,\nmaybe a few hundred yards ahead, right?\ntake the left and then all the roots\ntook it immediately.\n&gt;&gt; We saw everyone go this way and so we go\nthat way and there's two people standing\nthere\n&gt;&gt; and live there at the house at the\ncorner probably,\n&gt;&gt; right? But they're and they're like,\n\"No, the the route go that way.\" Like\nthey were trying\n&gt;&gt; someone's driveway.\n&gt;&gt; I'm telling you, they were trying to\nhills have eyes us. They were trying to\nTexas Chainsaw Massac us.\n&gt;&gt; They hate cyclists. And it was like the\nthe route that they said was like up\nsomeone's driveway and they told us\neveryone had just gone by and they're\nlike everyone went that way.\n&gt;&gt; When they said that I did believe them\nfor a second. So I like went to the map\nin my head unit and zoomed out.\n&gt;&gt; So obviously\n&gt;&gt; there was no that wasn't a road.\n&gt;&gt; It was a driveway.\n&gt;&gt; And then the guy we were like no we're\ngoing this way. And the guy went\n&gt;&gt; whatever.\n&gt;&gt; And then when we looked back after they\nwere moving some cones around in the\nroad again. I saw I saw I don't know\nwhat that that was\n&gt;&gt; that was weird. And I'm keeping that\nback my mind. So, I see a news story pop\nup.\n&gt;&gt; Any police reports about cyclists\nmissing from D2R2?\n&gt;&gt; I think we could find it on the map. We\ncould tell you where it was.\n&gt;&gt; Did you talk to that other guy? Did that\nhappen to him? Cuz I talked to a few\nothers and it didn't happen to\n&gt;&gt; I talked to a guy who we were sort of\nriding along with for a good amount of\ntime. He was riding a trek and yes, I\nwas like, \"Hey, do those people try to\ntell you to go the long way the wrong\nway?\" Not the long way home. He was\nseeing the super the wrong way. And and\nhe was like, \"Yeah, yeah, whatever.\"\nThey were just messing with us. They\ndidn't seem like they were like\n&gt;&gt; No, they were pretty like\n&gt;&gt; they weren't like joking.\n&gt;&gt; No, they were pretty like sterious like\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. Not to judge these people, but\nthey seemed really uh simple.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's that's correct. But\n&gt;&gt; it just seemed really sketch. It just\nseemed really sketch.\n&gt;&gt; Um\n&gt;&gt; but the bear was cool.\n&gt;&gt; The bear was cool.\n&gt;&gt; The bear was cool. Uh we saw Cole for\nabout 2 minutes\nduring the ride and then immediately our\nfirst ride he just went straight. Just\nas just thought we'd be with him a\nlittle bit longer. How you feeling right\nnow?\n&gt;&gt; We've been down for about an hour.\n&gt;&gt; I feel pretty good. I feel I'm going to\nfeel it tomorrow. Right now I feel good.\nMy knee held up good enough. Uh that was\ngood cuz that was living in the back of\nmy mind. I'm like I'm going to feel knee\npain point. Is this going to happen? So\nthe fact that I\n&gt;&gt; made it is good. Man, I'm tired though.\nThat's not that that's probably the\nhardest local and I say like local New\nEngland ride that I have personally done\naround here.\n&gt;&gt; Oh yeah, me too. I think it's the\nhardest\n&gt;&gt; for like a one day.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. for like a one day event, you\nknow, in terms of metrics. Like\n&gt;&gt; I've done that greylock ride a couple\ntimes which Burbella puts on and it's\nthe the metrics for GTR2 is a little bit\nmore a little bit harder\n&gt;&gt; but at least 50% gravel probably 60\nsomething or 70.\n&gt;&gt; Oh and one thing that you brought up\nwhile we were riding here like I want to\ntalk about this.\n&gt;&gt; Oh yeah.\n&gt;&gt; How much flat how much how many miles\nyou think were flat? I can probably\ncount on two hands how single digits how\nmany miles were like just truly flat.\nYou were either bombing down a hill or\nclimbing straight up a hill. There's no\nin between.\n&gt;&gt; Say there were seven miles of flat. The\nlast four were flat.\n&gt;&gt; So like then there were three\ninterspersed within 106.\n&gt;&gt; Maybe like a couple times along the\nriver when we were meandering there was\none like four mile road or so. But\n&gt;&gt; right\n&gt;&gt; there's that Green River road is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]\nsick.\n&gt;&gt; Beautiful.\n&gt;&gt; It's sick. There is very there's very\nlittle like regret bombing down hill. A\nlot of those hills that you bomb down,\nthey're fun, but like you got to be\nfocused. You can't just\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. You can't just go down it.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. You're not really chilling. It's\nnot really a ride for chilling.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. It's just a hard ride.\n&gt;&gt; But it was great.\n&gt;&gt; Some of those hills. What are we at?\nAlmost 50 48 48 mphish or so. Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And we think it was on the gravel\nsection.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. Oh my god. I think it was Dog Hill\nRoad or Dog something\n&gt;&gt; and it like bombed down straight and we\nwere flying and it was nice because\nthere was a good\n&gt;&gt; It was smooth.\n&gt;&gt; It was smooth. It was a good viewpoint.\nYeah,\n&gt;&gt; you could see cuz it was straight. It\nwasn't any corners or anything cuz\nthere's also that super steep paved\ndownhill which is like trucks use engine\nbrakes, you know, like big big like you\nknow\n&gt;&gt; that was wild. That's a river of a\ndownhill.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. And I I think like you know\nthere's a couple sections where you're\ngoing up at 17 18% and those downhills\nwere around the same some of the really\nfast ones you know.\n&gt;&gt; And my brain is absolutely fried. I\ndon't know.\n&gt;&gt; So I mean maybe we start kind of how the\nride starts maybe uh how we started. We\nkind of rolled out. It's a casual roll\nout right like\n&gt;&gt; the bag pipe\n&gt;&gt; bag pipe playing of course misty misty\nmorning bag pipes\n&gt;&gt; every feels like that's probably every\nmorning around this time of year for me.\n&gt;&gt; Yes. Right. Um, yeah. I mean, we rolled\nout. It's kind casual. There's no gun\ngo. Just you kind of roll out, which I\nlove cuz it gets rid of the like\n&gt;&gt; I'm going to win this.\n&gt;&gt; Yes. And it also gets rid of any like\nbottlenecks.\n&gt;&gt; You know, cuz like when I'm personally\nas someone that like doesn't have the\nmost confidence on like a technical\ndescent, which there there weren't many,\nbut there was one towards the end.\n&gt;&gt; I much preferred not being near anyone.\n&gt;&gt; A couple people.\n&gt;&gt; Oh my god. Yeah. Like that's like and\nI'm not this this the purpose of this\nvideo is not to talk [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] about the\noverland even though you know I have and\nI'm sure you can find that somewhere\nelse.\nOverland is always that because also it\nis a race. DRG is not a race. So it's a\ndifferent vibe but there are people\npassing you on those downhills like on\nyour left\n&gt;&gt; and I'm like flying.\n&gt;&gt; I'm like bro you're lucky if I don't go\nleft you know\n&gt;&gt; barely in control of my own body.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. Exactly. You know and so okay so\nwe roll out. It starts climbing like\nright away, like three miles into it,\nyou're already starting.\n&gt;&gt; And you can like if you have a Garmin\nhead unit, it can show you how many\nhills there are.\n&gt;&gt; 30 climbs if you have it on the default\nset.\n&gt;&gt; If you had default setting, it showed 30\nclimbs. I heard some other people talk\nsaying like 17 climbs.\n&gt;&gt; I was like, you are doing yourself a\ndisservice.\n&gt;&gt; those 30 climbs are there probably a few\nof them that were like, okay, this isn't\na climb, but I'd say like 25 of them\nwere they were like legit climbs.\nenough that I would want to know about\nthem ahead of time,\n&gt;&gt; right? We're talking like we're talking\nanything from like half a mile, 100 150\nft to\n&gt;&gt; 1.6 miles and 860 ft.\n&gt;&gt; And there was there were some 5 mile\nones that were like 1,400 ft,\n&gt;&gt; you know? So like those might average 5%\ngrade. Some of the other ones average\nlike 10%, you know, there was that one\nreally hard one at the end. Um, but we\nrode with like a good group. We met some\npeople in the beginning. kind of did a\nlot of leaprogging.\n&gt;&gt; Lot of leaprogging. Yep. The first rest\nstop was great.\n&gt;&gt; Same as last year.\n&gt;&gt; Right near the Airbnb.\n&gt;&gt; Right near the Airbnb. That's right.\n&gt;&gt; The uh Nutella sandwiches. Big fan.\n&gt;&gt; Had a few of those.\n&gt;&gt; A lot of like homemade food and stuff. I\nI do I guess that my one gripe would be\nit would be nice if there were more\ngel type stuff. They did have heed mix.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, true. There's no there's no like I\ncycling snack in the sense of a goo or\nlike an untabs or anything like that.\nIt's all\n&gt;&gt; homemade food. Bananas, pickles.\n&gt;&gt; I mean, which are great and probably\nmost people really appreciate cuz I\ndon't think most people are like, \"Give\nme a science and sport gel.\"\n&gt;&gt; I was thinking about it. I didn't have a\nsingle gel. I had a few RX bars, which\nis that I didn't have a single gel\nbecause regular food all day.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I didn't have a single gel. I\nmean, maybe I should have because I kind\nof was [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] cracked. Absolutely\ncracked. I don't think I bumped.\n&gt;&gt; No, you didn't. Either didn't.\n&gt;&gt; I think I cracked. I absolutely was\ncracked. Um,\nbut then I dove into my nerds gummy\nclusters and I think they brought me\nback to life a little bit.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it seems like after\n&gt;&gt; after the last big hill. Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Uh, you seem to come back to life a\nlittle bit. Or even on that hill, you\nseem like you were coming back.\n&gt;&gt; You lost me a little bit on the\ndownhill,\n&gt;&gt; but you're just so much more technically\nsavvy on downhills like that other than\nme over, you know? I mean, that's one\nthing why I I love riding with you in\nthe woods because you're a great person\nto follow uphill because you're strong\nand downhill because you're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] so\ngood. I think, you know,\n&gt;&gt; I And then I ride with people like Cole\nand I'm like, \"Oh, that's what it means\nto be good.\" Like, yeah. Yeah. But thank\nyou.\n&gt;&gt; It's all perspective, right? It's all\nperspective. But like to me to follow\nsomeone cuz like if you're behind a\nchucklehead,\n&gt;&gt; which you know, just someone that you\ndon't know, I guess\n&gt;&gt; you don't really know if you can trust\ntheir line.\n&gt;&gt; No. down a down a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you know class\n4 road or whatever. I don't know if they\ncall them class 4 roads around here. We\ndid dip into Vermont for a second.\n&gt;&gt; Someone that we were getting uh food\nwith afterwards. She was like it's a\nclass 3.5.\n&gt;&gt; Wow. But yeah. What um what are some\nOkay, so the first rest stop that was\ngreat. The the rest stops are pretty\nwell spaced too. I feel like except for\nmaybe the last one was a little long,\nbut those kids those kids man that's a\nlittle bit ahead. Those kids are\nawesome.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. So the So then\n&gt;&gt; 2 hour mark took to 145 for us to get to\nthe first race.\n&gt;&gt; The first one. Yep. And then we sort of\nwe roll out with some people. There were\na couple people that we rode with quite\na bit. I think there was a one guy who I\ndidn't catch his name, but he\n&gt;&gt; with the hydro pack.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. He saved my bottle.\n&gt;&gt; Oh yeah. All day. That guy. Yeah. That\nguy.\n&gt;&gt; He saved my ass. I lost a bottle on a\ndescent and I got to the bottom and I\nwas like, \"Fuck.\"\n&gt;&gt; I don't know if he's going to watch this\nor whatever, but whoever you are, dude,\nyou were a strong rider to a super nice\nguy. so nice and and I thanked him a\ncouple times. Like we saw him at the\nlast rest stop. I was like, \"Thanks so\nmuch. You saved my ass.\" He was like,\n\"You would have done it for me.\" Like it\nwas just so nice\n&gt;&gt; to set the scene. You dropped your\nbottle on a hill that like you leave\nyour bottle if you realize you got to\nthe bottom and you don't have it.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. You don't want to climb back up\nit. Not with another\n&gt;&gt; miles of like seven or eight% uphill.\n&gt;&gt; Right. Not with another 10,000 ft of\nclimbing in front of you. You don't want\nto go up that\n&gt;&gt; maybe 30 40 m into it or so. Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. And that would have been bad if I\nonly had one bottle. I mean, I could\nhave bought one or whatever at the lunch\nstop.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. which was Okay, so second rest\nstop was not lunch.\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; What's the second stop?\n&gt;&gt; I can't even remember. It was going to\nbe Oh. Oh, it was like side of the road\non the left. There was a tent. We came\nup in a little bit of a wooded area.\n&gt;&gt; Yes. The people who were there were\nsuper kind. I believe there was a The\nlady had a Scottish accent, I think.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, she did. Yeah. Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; She was super nice. They said it was\ntheir first time volunteering.\n&gt;&gt; Again, great great 5gallon bucket of\npickles.\n&gt;&gt; Yep. And then one was full of pickles\nlike to the brim and the other was just\nfull of pickle juice.\n&gt;&gt; There was a lot of there was a good\namount of pickle juice. Brine pickle\nbrine. Um which then that's what how\nthey were marketing it at least.\n&gt;&gt; And then yeah after that is lunch\nwhich you know if you watched earlier in\nthe video that was at the that's the one\nat the um the bridge the covered bridge.\n&gt;&gt; They don't mess around with lunch.\n&gt;&gt; No. At this point\n&gt;&gt; there was so much. What did you have?\n&gt;&gt; I had quinoa. I had half of a buffalo\nsandwich.\n&gt;&gt; Wasn't spicy enough for you?\n&gt;&gt; No, I wanted it spicier. Uh,\n&gt;&gt; you could you are you a spice guy?\n&gt;&gt; Not crazy, but I\n&gt;&gt; But it wasn't even spicy enough for you.\n&gt;&gt; No, it wasn't. It was like nothing. I\nactually was like, is this buffalo?\n&gt;&gt; I know you did say that. It looked like\norange.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it was like turkey buffalo.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but anyways, it was like it was\ngood. And there were so many options.\nSandwiches.\n&gt;&gt; There was pasta salad. There were\ncookies.\n&gt;&gt; Cookies. Like all the same snacks, like\nthe M&amp;M's, like all the grab snacks that\nwere\n&gt;&gt; different sodas. And then they had this\nlike I didn't really get a good look at\nthe table.\n&gt;&gt; Birch booth kind of.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you can buy like valve caps like\nuh dice valve caps and like sunglasses\nand buffs and cycling caps and water\nbottles. So I don't know if they were\nlike giving them out or cuz there was a\ntip jar.\n&gt;&gt; Like a tip jar. It's probably one of\nthose like hey you can take one but we\nreally appreciate a tip.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. Which was super nice.\n&gt;&gt; And then we left that and we went\nstraight straight into a big old climb.\n&gt;&gt; Yes. Of course. That was a five mile\nclimb, I think, right after lunch,\n&gt;&gt; was it?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah, it was at least a couple,\nbut it was a big one. It was like a\npyramid when you looked at the\nelevation.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah,\n&gt;&gt; that was tough.\n&gt;&gt; But it's really nice to like like seeing\nall the different people at the lunchtop\ncuz basically most of the routes go\nthere.\n&gt;&gt; There must have been 100 people or so I\nwould say at the restaurant over the\nside of the road, you know,\n&gt;&gt; right at the covered bridge directing\ntraffic.\n&gt;&gt; Directing traffic.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's like a super wellrun event.\nOkay. They know what they're doing.\n&gt;&gt; After that, the next rest stop is not\nthe kids. Not yet, right?\n&gt;&gt; I think it might have been. I think it\nwas cuz we went from 65 to and then 90\nis the next real rest stop.\n&gt;&gt; That's right. So, that was at lunch is\nat mile 65 and then the next official\nrest stop is at mile 90 and that's\nthat's a lot of miles. That's 25 miles.\n&gt;&gt; I was running out of water. I would have\nrun\n&gt;&gt; 2 hours at least.\nAnd yeah, we so in between there are\nthese kids who we saw last year and\nthey're just there like they have a big\nsign that says D2R2 H2O.\n&gt;&gt; They had Sour Patch Kids and like\ngrapefruit watermelon.\n&gt;&gt; Two big like you know three gallon.\n&gt;&gt; They said it was their sixth year of\njust satin shop in front of their house.\nLike they they must have been like 14 15\nyears old.\n&gt;&gt; One of them doesn't even ride bikes. The\nother one rides mountain bikes.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. And they just like were doing it\nout of the kindness of their heart,\nwhich is super cool.\n&gt;&gt; Especially like at that age, you know?\n&gt;&gt; Well, if you were saying like when I was\nthat age, I wouldn't have given a crap\nabout doing\n&gt;&gt; I was throwing snowballs at cars, you\nknow what I mean? Like not I'm not\ncondoning it. That's a bad thing to do.\nBut that's I wasn't that type of kid at\nall.\n&gt;&gt; And they were like wicked. They weren't\nshy. Like we just talked with them and\nthey were super cool. Like\n&gt;&gt; honestly though, not like they they\nbailed us out. Like I would have been\npretty tough on water there. Yeah. Um I\nfilled my bottle, chugged a bunch, and\nthen refilled them both.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it was great.\n&gt;&gt; And then so that was maybe 75 80 miles.\nAnd so we had about 10 more miles to the\nnext rest stop. But\n&gt;&gt; but\n&gt;&gt; not an easy 10 miles.\n&gt;&gt; That was a hard Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; What's the name of the hill?\n&gt;&gt; Patent Hill. P A T N. Patent Hill.\n&gt;&gt; That's a 10% average. 1.8 miles, I\nthink. 10% average grade.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. The Stravis the Straen was like\n1.7 something 800 something feet of\nclimbing.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that sounds right. I think I saw\n1.8 850 on my\n&gt;&gt; and it like kicks immediately on\npavement but then it's only for about\na/4 mile and half mile and then it's\ndirt the rest of the way.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Like not quite single track trail. It\nwas like double wide, but it was like\nnot a dirt road. It was in the woods. So\n&gt;&gt; that hill was hard.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it was pretty gnarly.\n&gt;&gt; And then that's almost the end of the\nclimbing if you will. There were like\nthree climbs after that.\n&gt;&gt; One of them was a few hundred feet. That\nwas a pretty tough.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it was like a mile and a half.\n&gt;&gt; After you've done that thing, I mean,\nanything is easy in comparison.\n&gt;&gt; And we sort of were just by ourselves at\nthat point. I mean, we were maybe like\nleaprogging a couple people, but we\ndidn't really see some of the people\nthat we started with.\n&gt;&gt; Except for that guy, the guy with the\nhydro pack.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. He was there the entire time.\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; He was a good rider. He was strong.\n&gt;&gt; He was just so consistent.\n&gt;&gt; Yep. And then at the end we ran into\nPaul with his NVX Jaws jersey on. That\nwas nice to see. And so we see him all\nthree like where all three of us are\ntogether and then we hit that downhill\nsection. Was it Hawk Road or something?\nI think so.\n&gt;&gt; Downhill.\n&gt;&gt; And that's what I was saying where you\nsort of like separated yourself and Paul\nand I were riding together\n&gt;&gt; and then that's the like the last climb.\nThere's like 3 miles left at 20 ft of\nclimbing and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]\n&gt;&gt; And it's smooth road and you can just\ncook and you're feeling good. You know\nyou're almost done.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. You know you're almost done. And\nPaul sees he's like, \"Ah, Steman's guys.\nWe can catch the Stemman's guys.\"\nAnd sorry, we're slowing down. The\nmotorcycles are, you know, motorcycles,\nyou're not that different. You and us\nand you, we're not that different. Um,\n[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Paul's like, \"We can catch the\nStemmans, guys.\" Cuz we see like their\norange and uh, blue jerseys in front of\nus. And I'm like, \"Yeah, let's do it.\"\nWe trade polls a couple times. We don't\ncatch them. And then I see Adam at the\nend and Adam's like, \"I was pulling the\nSteman guys. You motherfucker.\"\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. I saw Jim and we were chatting and\nthen that last road felt like so good\nand like wide open. I was like, you\nknow, I was doing like 275, 290 or so on\nit. And I was just\n&gt;&gt; I was cranking. I was so talked. I was\non the top slipp by hoods. I was really\ntrying to catch up.\n&gt;&gt; I didn't get yelled to slow down. Be\nyelled at to slow down.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. Last year we did.\n&gt;&gt; We got yelled Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Slow down.\n&gt;&gt; Oh, speaking of getting yelled at, we\ngot yelled at when we pulled into the\nparking lot this morning. We were so\nexcited to get there that we were there\nat 4:59, which is before 5:00, right?\n&gt;&gt; And what did we hear?\n&gt;&gt; Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they they weren't ready for us.\n&gt;&gt; they weren't ready for it\n&gt;&gt; because apparently some people like\nparked in the lot that they weren't\nsupposed to overnight, I guess,\n&gt;&gt; which I mean,\nI don't Yeah, watching all that.\n&gt;&gt; But yeah, I mean, there's just a little\nbit of stress involved, you know, for\neveryone, for the people who are doing\nthe ride, for the organizers, a lot of\npeople. It's all volunteer. Yeah. Um,\nbut they have their stuff down. Like\nthey they know what they're doing with\nthis event. And\n&gt;&gt; when you look at events, I guess, well,\nthis has made me jump ahead, but you\nlook at events and value for what you\nget.\n&gt;&gt; First and foremost, when you do an event\nlike this,\n&gt;&gt; I try to separate myself from looking at\nwhat I'm getting in and saying that\nlike, oh, I'm actually donating my money\nto a good cause. Like, I try to think of\nthat because a lot of times I'll say,\nwhat do I get? That's not really what\nit's about, right? But that being said,\nyour money's going to a good cause, but\nI'm also getting probably one of the\nbetter return on investments for what\nwas provided to me at an event from this\none.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we didn't mention like, you know,\nmaybe if you watched last year's video,\nyou knew, if you did the ride, you knew,\nbut T2R2 is is organized by the Franklin\nLand Trust, which is uh, you know, an\norganization that basically scoops up\nproperty and and designates it to never\nbe developed on.\n&gt;&gt; For some of the most beautiful There's\ntons of it. You see signs all the whole\nride. This land is, you know, Franklin\nLand Trust will not be developed and\nit's everywhere. It's everywhere. So,\nthat's like a great great cause. You\nknow, a lot of these and it was a D. Do\nyou remember what the price point is?\n&gt;&gt; I want to say if you registered early,\nit may have been like 150 to 175 range.\nMaybe it was over 200 if you were\n&gt;&gt; I was going to say 165.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, and honestly, compared to\nother events in the similar price range,\nsimilar area, Yeah. 100% you get more\nout of this than most other events.\nAbsolutely. And it's fun to just It's a\nhard It's a challenge for everyone.\nYou're not racing though. There's that\nnot There's not that\n&gt;&gt; culture around it.\n&gt;&gt; No. No. There weren't really like It\nwasn't hard. There weren't I didn't\nreally experience any hardos.\n&gt;&gt; Right. It was just like fun.\n&gt;&gt; No. Once you settle out your own pace\nand you kind of figure out who you're\ngoing to be with for the day, it's\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. It's just a great ride.\n&gt;&gt; There was one guy that kept passing me\non the right.\n&gt;&gt; Like, dude, can you just pass me on the\nleft? Yeah, it was early on.\n&gt;&gt; Black Rafy guy.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, maybe.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. Maybe black rock a jersey guy.\n&gt;&gt; There's definitely not many of those.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's plenty of you out there so\nwe can\n&gt;&gt; pretend that we don't really know who it\nwas. But\n&gt;&gt; all in all, yeah, great day.\n&gt;&gt; It was great. Um my brain is absolutely\nfried. I'm sure I could say more things,\nbut I really I'm having a hard time\nstructuring a sentence.\n&gt;&gt; And you have to drive us home to get us\nhome. So\n&gt;&gt; that's right.\n&gt;&gt; There's that.\n&gt;&gt; You got any closing thoughts?\nnothing more than kind of what I've said\nalready that Yeah. If it's something\nyou're looking for a challenge of any\nvariety, get a like a ride that might be\nslightly out of your comfort zone. They\nhave plenty of options. Sign up. Like\n&gt;&gt; I think that you won't if you've done\nother events and have a frame of\nreference, I don't think you will be\ndisappointed with what this event offers\nyou for the price and the donations.\nKeep it rural for like future riding and\nlike that will always be there if\nthey're doing what they're doing. And\nthis is an area that if you want to ride\nsomething that's like Vermont, but you\ndon't want to drive 4 hours to the good\npart of Vermont to ride, you're going to\nget the same vibe riding here. 2 hours.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. Even if you just come and ride,\nright? Like even if you just want to\ncome and and you know, spend some time\n&gt;&gt; And there's Treehouse right down the\nroad. There's Candle. There's a few\n&gt;&gt; Yankee Candle. Yep. The Yankee Candle.\n&gt;&gt; It's a great area. I really, really like\nit.\n&gt;&gt; Oh, and it was like, you know, a couple\npeople were like, \"Hey, we watched the\nvlog.\" Which is cool, you know, like,\n\"Hey, we watched this.\" like they were\nwatching it in their camp last night\nlike so to get a flavor for what the\nride was like.\n&gt;&gt; Exactly. Which is like really nice.\n&gt;&gt; They asked us what was your advice like\nwhat advice would you give for doing the\n180k? So maybe we could wrap up by\nsaying what advice would you give for\ndoing 180k?\n&gt;&gt; Uh I'd say eat early and eat often.\nThat's always that's sort of my biggest\ngo-to. Maybe you've heard me say it\nbefore, but on a big ride like that, I\nthink you really can't be eating early\nenough, I think.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. And I would say pace yourself too\nbecause\n&gt;&gt; it's easy to look at the numbers and say\nthat's going to be hard but I think I\ncan do it. But there's no rolling hills.\nYou are either going straight up\n&gt;&gt; or straight down.\n&gt;&gt; And you don't get a break. There's no\nclimbs with brakes on them. So just be\nprepared to pace yourself. And I would\nsay be prepared to spend minimally 8\nhours.\n&gt;&gt; Probably more.\n&gt;&gt; You know, and we, you know, we're from\nRhode Island and you know, I've heard\npeople be like, \"Well, there aren't\nreally that many hills in Rhode Island.\"\nBut we live in a hillier section of\nRhode Island.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. I'm giving 50 to 75 ft per mile or\nso in fall.\n&gt;&gt; And we seek out the hills a little bit,\nbut there's nothing like this around\n&gt;&gt; And for full context, this is like the\nsame metrics as like a tour stage or a\nVA stage. You know what I mean?\n&gt;&gt; 100 miles, 14,000 ft.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, that is, you know, and obviously\nwe're not going nearly as fast or or\nriding nearly as hard cuz we [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]\ncan't. But it is a really hard,\nchallenging, rewarding,\nyou know, you got to sort of pull\nyourself up from your bootstraps a\nlittle bit. But yeah, you know, believe\nin yourself and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it's it's it\nlike I don't know. I I I get a lot out\nof doing stuff like this. As much as I\nhated it at some moments, I was like,\nwhy the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] am I doing this? I get so\nmuch out of it because\n&gt;&gt; already an hour removed from finishing\ntwo hours removed. I'm like, yeah, that\nwas great. And like at the end of it,\nI'm like, oh, this is so hard.\n&gt;&gt; It's so rewarding. And like, you know,\nthere there was a time in my life where\nI never thought like I was a fat kid,\nyou know what I mean? Like I never\nthought I would ever do something like\nthis. And there's not to pat ourselves\nin the back, but there's plenty of\npeople that will never do what we just\n[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] did.\n&gt;&gt; And that makes not because other people\nwon't do it, but just because it seems\nlike hard.\n&gt;&gt; Um but you can do it. We saw tons of\ndifferent types of people. Like I said,\nthere's tons of different rides. be, you\nknow, different distances and so maybe\nyou want to go and just like do the 100k\nfirst.\n&gt;&gt; And they're ebike friendly, too. It's\njust a fun run. So if you want to do the\n100k and you want to even do it on an\ne-ravel bike, I mean there's so many\nways just getting out there and doing\nthat riding, right?\n&gt;&gt; It's worth it. I mean,\n&gt;&gt; experiencing a new area. Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. You see the video, the scenery is\nunbelievable.\n&gt;&gt; All right. Thanks for thanks for doing\nit, Adam.\nThanks for helping me be motivated and\nand and thanks to MBX for supporting us.\nThanks to Rotation Engineering for\nsupporting us\n&gt;&gt; between the two of them. Yeah, that's\n&gt;&gt; Did you get any help? People Some people\npicked out your Cella, right? The new\none or something.\n&gt;&gt; No one said Jack about my bike.\n&gt;&gt; It's so cool. It's so cool. I'll say\nsomething. It's freaking cool.\n&gt;&gt; Oh, thank you. I love it a lot. But no\none and that's fine. It's all black. And\nyou know, I didn't really want the Oh,\nyou got the new Asparero fight because I\ndid get the uh Are you on YouTube?\n&gt;&gt; Which is like, yeah, I am, but like are\nyou clowning me right now or do you And\nmost people were nice. Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; One guy came up to me at one point. He\nwas wearing a Mystic Cycle Center\njersey.\n&gt;&gt; And he goes, \"Hey, I got to ask you\nsomething. Do you do like social media\nstuff?\" I was like, \"Yeah.\" He's like,\n\"You're in my algorithm.\" I was like,\n\"I'm sorry.\" He's like, \"No, no, no. I\nappreciate it. It was very nice.\" But\nyeah, thanks, dude. Thank you, NBX.\nThank you, Rotation.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. Thank you, guys.\n&gt;&gt; And what do you think? Will you do it\nagain?\n&gt;&gt; 100%. I love it. I will 100% do it\nagain.\n&gt;&gt; That's the positivity that I need cuz\nI'm I'm on the fence, but\n&gt;&gt; I'll do it again.\n&gt;&gt; They just need to coordinate better with\nOverland.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it shouldn't be the same weekend.\n&gt;&gt; That's tough cuz I know there are some\nguys doing it tomorrow. It's weird\nbecause I would have wanted to do both\nof them, but like so if that says\nanything, I wanted to have a fun day but\nnot a race mentality. I chose to do this\nthis weekend to give it an option\nbetween the two. So,\n&gt;&gt; yeah. I mean, the overland's tough and\nit's hard and it can be fun, but it's\njust definitely a different vibe, you\nknow? Um,\n&gt;&gt; this is harder of a ride.\n&gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. It's like\n&gt;&gt; I'm not race pacing it, but this is a\nharder ride.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. More cooked after.\nDefinitely like more calories burned,\nyou know.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. I got about 5,000.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. Me, too.\n&gt;&gt; All right, see you on the next one.\n&gt;&gt; Peace.\n[Laughter]",

Settled near the Connecticut River in the 17th century during the colonial era, the population was 5,090 as of the 2020 census. Deerfield is part of the Springfield, Massachusetts Metropolitan Statistical Area in western Massachusetts, lying 30 miles (48 km) north of the city of Springfield.\" - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deerfield,_Massachusetts\n\n\"Deerfield includes the villages of South Deerfield and Old Deerfield, which is home to two museums: Pocumtuck Valley Memorial Association and Historic Deerfield, Inc. Historic Deerfield is designated as a National Historic Landmark district, and the organization operates a museum with a focus on decorative arts, early American material culture, and history. Its eleven house museums offer interpretation of society, history, and culture from the colonial era through the late nineteenth century.\"\n\nDeerfield is also home to D2R2, the Deerfield Dirt Road Randonee':\n\"We celebrate the landscape, the history, and the rural culture of western Massachusetts, and work to ensure, through a program of land protection, that the historic pattern of field, woodland and village will endure for the benefit of generations to come.\"\n\n\"The Deerfield Dirt-Road Randonnee was conceived in the 1990's as just a favorite dirt-road loop in the hilltowns of Franklin County, Massachusetts. Since its birth as an organized event in 2005, many have hailed D2R2 as the hardest, most beautiful, most fun, most traffic-free, most unique, and overall best ride that they have ever done.\"\n\nLearn more at the D2R2 Website - https://www.franklinlandtrust.org/d2r2/\n\nIn this video, JOM of the Gravel Cyclist crew rides an abbreviated variant of the 100km course of D2R2. His route ends up being about 85km in total, with a ton of climbing.

          "transcript": "good day TR Setters today I'm coming to\nyou from beautiful Historic Deerfield\nMassachusetts some of you watching this\nvideo may know all about or have ridden\nthe Fantastic d2r to event typically\nheld late August every year I have\nridden that event way back in 2014 was\nmy last appearance ironically aboard a\ndrop bar mountain bike guy built up to\ntackle some of the Dodge a type events\nthat I was frequenting at the time now\nwe fast forward to 2024 and just about\nevery professional gravel cyclist person\nseems to be banging on about drop bar\nmountain bikes and their pioneering ways\nhowever I\ndigress I have with me a really\ninteresting bike a review bike\nnonetheless with clearance of 700 C XX\n50 mm tires this is the gorgeous oficina\nbaglin which in English means Workshop\nbaglin it is an Italian bike steel there\nyou go handmade in Italy fitted out with\ntram's brand\nnew EAP red 13-speed system all these\ngoodies are under review I've got a\ncourse of my own design mapped out it's\nabout 50 Mi there is a lot of elevation\naround here and I'm filling yesterday's\nlegs I was going to ride the 100K course\nI rode the OG course when I did this\nevent years ago the 180 but I definitely\ndon't have the legs for that and\nobviously there's not a lot of Support\noptions out here so got two bottles on\nboard enough juice for today's distance\nand cooler temperatures as you can tell\nby the way I'm dressed there is the\nHistoric Deerfield in I'm starting off\nat The Visitor Center make my way to the\ncourse Museum gift Etc there you go the\npost office for Deerfield zip code\n03 correction\n01342 this is the grounds of the\nDeerfield\nAcademy beautiful town without doubt\nit's definitely a vest day and I'd like\nto thank my clothing sponsor castelli\nfor making me look Splendid and keep me\nRolling In Style\nit's a rather dreary day today however\nit's supposed to be raining a lot\ntomorrow so this is the day to knock out\nthis ride all being well any light rain\nis going to clear up pretty soon from\nmemory the d22 event I think it stages\nin that\nfield well it's around here somewhere\nanyway if I get a chance I might throw\nin a couple of exerts on my old 2014\nvideo which was purely point of view\nonly from the\nhandlebars the first of 16 climbs on\ntoday menu and I have low gearing\nthankfully onto the first dirt road\nproper all right then 14%\nbring you low\ngears very slippery rocks and such\nhere I remember d22 being pretty\nrugged so I'm glad I've got some Wier\ntires\ntoday namely a pair of those\nchuo fundos\nvery Rocky but very beautiful through\nthis section\nhere well the first climb is mostly\nflattened\nout and back on the pavement\nI'm sure I mentioned this earlier you\nhave to like climbing if you're riding\nanywhere around Deerfield\nMassachusetts onto the next nextx\nsurface\nRoad I got that last Road wrong I was on\nsome bl's dairy farm\nRoad\n15% this climb is on the 100K course\nit's\n[Applause]\nearly oh yeah check out that road I'm\nheaded towards need some momentum\nGuinea\nfoul\no everybody's having a lovely sleep\nalready having to resort to\ntacking one or two of these climbs paper\nboing as I call it\nthird week of September\n2024 the leaves are definitely changing\nthat is what I'm talking about Trend\nsets 11% descent bloody\nbeautiful I've had far too many\n15% grades thus far\n68 yeah welcome to a town whose name I\ndon't\nknow I crack 70 K an hour do not try\nthat one handed like I was doing that's\nkind of mental\nI'm thinking I'll be back onto a Gravel\nRoad in a couple of seconds here yep\nthere we\ngo the organizers of\nd22 which benefits the Franklin Land\nTrust they certainly know this area\nreally\nwell these are some pretty cherry pretty\namazing dirt roads even if they're are\nsome extremely steep little buggers to\ntest your mental fortitude and legs\ntesting the\nlimitations of the one by gearing I have\na 42 chain ring and the biggest Cog is\n46 so it's less than 1 to one but I\nwould outfit this bike if I have my\nchoice in the\nmatter honestly I really do prefer two\nbuys especially for this sort of terrain\nyou can't have low enough\ngears this climb is a royal\nmfer it's over 2ks long it's been\naveraging about\n10% on the positive the scenery is\ngorgeous\nI am loving these new Shram hydraulic\nbrake levers currently they're only\navailable on the red level maybe they'll\ntrickle down\nbut so comfortable so much power and\nmodulation as you can see I've been\nriding onehanded and I've been breaking\nonehanded quite a decent\namount of course I don't recommend you\nride one-handed on these sorts of dodgy\nroads\nroad marker Massachusetts\n1896 and on the other side Vermont 1896\nso this is the Border I've just crossed\ninto Vermont for this part of the route\nwhat's interesting about this point of\nthe ride is I cut the 100 kilm Route\nshort by about 20ks so I'm going to turn\nbasically up there and urn onto another\nroad effectively well a sharp hair pin\ntype turn so I'm going to be in for mon\nriding for all of about 450 M then back\ninto Massachusetts so it is what it is\nhere is the herin turns referring to\nordinarily the 100K rwood be left I'm\ntaking a sharp right\nhello and welcome back to\ncivilization this gorgeous ofina that is\ngetting very dirty today\nbut that's what it was made for\nRoad closed 916 to something or other\nwell fingers crossed it's not closed\nbecause I've got about 2 miles still on\nthe\nroad or just over 3 km I a prepared to\nhoof it if I had to get past the road\nclosure hello Mr squirrel\nanother tough\nclimb 3.6 K long looks like an average\nof close to 8%\nthere is some creative tree trimming for\nyou lovely view on Top This\nRidge at Apex Orchards\n[Music]\npassing through a small town light rain\nhas started to fall again less than 20\nkm to right now the rain's been falling\npretty\nsteadily I'm just going to keep going\nhere I have knocked on my rain\njacket yeah but if it starts getting\nheavier I definitely\nwill this vest I'm wearing is fantastic\nor a gilay as some people like to call\nthem such a flexible garment\napologies for any water spots on the\nlens just what the doctor ordered\nanother wall within the final 10\nmiles we have about 11ks a ride and it\nsays right there the road is closed\nclosed let's hope it isn't closed or at\nleast it's not closed to my bicycle I\nhave about 4\nkm to ride on this road fingers\ncrossed yes this road is rather dodgy I\nhave to\nsay now always on the\nbikee you would need a four-wheel drive\nvehicle for this road look at that\ngnarliness right\nthere my bike just laughs at\nit I wouldn't take a sports car on this\nroad not bloody likely that is the\ndefinition of a\nrut it could be spicy descending this\nthing I am on the climb wall at the\nmoment paron the shaky\none-handed camera\nwork stopping for a second Trend set is\nthis the send is pretty spicy a lot of\nrocks that are very slick and there's\nleaves everywhere disguising rocks so\nI'm going to descend with both hands on\nThe Handlebar on the drops for maximum\ncontrol and with my weight behind the\nsaddle quick pause for a second on The\nDescent here so if you get your line\nwrong coming down from the direction in\ncamera shot and you take the right side\nline well it's completely off Cana and\nyou're probably going to end up in the\nRut so you got to make a line switch but\nobviously you have to do it nice and\ncarefully there's plenty of rocks around\nthe place as you can see so I always use\ncaution on these descents and like I\nmentioned wait behind the saddle and I\nalways get onto the drops and I feather\nthe brakes on off on off to avoid\nrunning them\nand obviously building up heat and so\non I believe I'm into the final stretch\nso to speak less than 7ks or less than 5\nmil to go and the Gman tells\nme I've got less than 30 m of climbing\nleft so that's good there's been a lot\nof steep climbing cling today and this\nis an abbreviated course an 80k version\nof the\n100K home stretch now I just crossed the\nriver less than 5K the go all pavement\nfrom here on in back into\nMassachusetts hello again TR seters\nwelcome back into\nMassachusetts and back to the visitor\ncenter\nright began\ntoday's ride\nexperience here we go visit the\ncenter righto Trend Setters that wraps\nup today's ride experience starting and\nending in beautiful and Historic\nDeerfield Massachusetts home to the D2\nR2 cycling event I'll link that

This event took us through the scenic rolling hills of northern central Massachusetts and southern Vermont, where I rode alongside old friends and new ones, including Adam (@bike_rhode_island) and Rich aka Richie Pancakes. Along the way, we encountered stunning views, challenging terrain, and even a porcupine!\n\nOne of the highlights of the day was stopping for lunch next to a covered bridge—a perfect moment to refuel and soak in the laid-back, yet still challenging, atmosphere that makes D2R2 such a special event. This is definitely an event I’ll be participating in for years to come.\n\nIf you love gravel, adventure, and camaraderie, you won’t want to miss this recap!

seen some videos online so\npeople have put some good videos here on\nYouTube but don't really know what to\nexpect and that's exciting that's 150\nbucks for this ride talk about the food\nthat we're getting apparently there's a\nlunch stop right in the middle at the\ntop of a hill or something there's a big\nold lunch stop I bet it's probably at\nthe bottom of the hill you got to climb\nright after it's usually how it works\nall the rest stops are right before the\nclimbing so that lactic acid builds up\njust a little bit more just a little bit\nwhile you're eating that peanut butter\nand

overall d22 is a great\nevent all the money goes to the Franklin\nland trust and there was a lot a lot of\nland marked on that 180k 110 M ride of\nprotected and preserved land land that\nthey're not going to build on and so\nthat's a good cause it is a pretty penny\n150 bucks is not a little am amount of\nmoney but it goes to something good and\nthat's that's good yeah there was some\ngreat apple crisp at the end some\nburrito bowls we got free pint glasses\nthere was a beer involved tried to hand\naway my ticket no one freaking wanted it\nbut great event would do again hope to\nmake it more of a weekend next year go\nup with a few extra people camp or get\nan Airbnb or something so just putting\nthat out there if you're interested in\ndoing D2 R2 maybe again maybe for the\nfirst time let me know and we'll link up\ndefinitely do the 180k again there were\na couple of sections that were a little\naggressive for me definitely my\nconfidence gets sucked out on technical\ndownhills on gravel I'll go up that\ntechnical [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] all day it really doesn't\nbother me I don't get as scared but I do\nbecome a little bit of a coward on those\ntechy descents especially when there are\npeople behind me I will say that was the\ngood thing because it wasn't a race and\nbecause it wasn't a mass St there wasn't\nmuch congestion\non those uh sections so yeah great event\nreally well run really well stocked\nthank you FL Franklin land trust and\neveryone else and now I'm sling my words\nand saying and a lot so I'm going to go\nhome finally shower clean my bike but I\ndo feel accomplished I think that's same\nat least I do feel accomplished it see\nyou next year\ndecaf left regular right decaf left\nregular right it's very challenging work",
