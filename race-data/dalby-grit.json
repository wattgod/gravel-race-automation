        "explanation": "This is literally year two of a race nobody's heard of yet. Sure, Focal Events runs the Dirty Reiver, but that doesn't make their forest experiment instantly prestigious. No meaningful winners list, no history, no stories - just a new event trying to position itself as a 'UK gravel classic' before it's earned the right."
      },
      "race_quality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "The organization looks solid - UCI format categories, professional timing with splits, three feed stations, and clear course marking with distance callouts. But it's still unproven territory with only one edition behind it. The 110km loop through Dalby Forest hits the technical boxes, but race quality needs time to reveal itself in the chaos of execution."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "You get the full weekend village experience with camping, showers, and expo access, plus they're not cutting corners on support. The course promises technical corners and fast descents through Crosscliff Wood after the White Cliff Rigg climb. But without rider testimonials or established atmosphere, it's still a gamble whether this delivers memorable or just adequate."
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Zero community feedback exists because this thing barely has a pulse yet. Age categories from 19-84 suggest they want everyone involved, and the camping/weekend format could build something decent. But community isn't programmed by organizers - it's earned through shared suffering and stories that don't exist yet."
      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Pro/Elite category exists on paper, but there's no evidence serious riders are showing up. Field size isn't even disclosed, which usually means it's embarrassingly small. New races take years to attract depth - right now you're racing against whoever happened to stumble across the entry page."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "£87.50 gets you professional timing, three feed stations, mechanical support, weekend parking, showers, and camping options. That's actually reasonable for a properly supported gravel event in the UK. The distance-to-suffering ratio looks decent at 110km with 1800m of climbing - you're not getting shortchanged on the physical challenge."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Entry fee sits at £87.50 which isn't cheap but isn't highway robbery either. Camping is available at sign-on, and parking is free for the weekend, so accommodation costs stay reasonable. Dalby Forest location means you're not dealing with London-level expense inflation, but travel costs depend entirely on where you're starting from."
      },
      "length": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "110km is respectable but not epic - it's in that middle ground where it's not a quick blast but won't destroy your weekend either. The 1800m of elevation spread over that distance means you're working but not grinding through endless suffering. It's a solid day out, just not the kind of distance that separates pretenders from believers."
      },
      "technicality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Technical corners and fast descents through forest trails sound promising, plus short sharp kickers after the sustained climbing. The course marking includes double/triple arrows for steep descents, suggesting some legitimate technical challenge. But 'perfect Dalby gravel' on forest access roads isn't exactly gnarly - it's technical enough to matter, not technical enough to terrify."
      },
      "elevation": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "1800m over 110km gives you 16.4m per kilometer - that's steady work but nothing brutal. White Cliff Rigg provides the main climbing test early, then sustained height through the middle sections. It's enough elevation to hurt but not enough to make this a pure climber's race."
      },
      "climate": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Late June in North York Moors could be anything from perfect to miserable, and there's zero historical weather data since this race barely exists. British weather in summer is a coin flip between decent and soggy disappointment. The forest setting provides some shelter but also traps humidity when it gets warm."
      },
      "altitude": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "This is the North York Moors, not the Alps. You're looking at lowland moors with forest trails - altitude isn't even worth discussing. The highest point probably barely registers as a hill compared to real mountain racing."
      },
      "logistics": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Free weekend parking with access codes and on-site facilities cover the basics, but key details are missing. No specified start time, no airport information, no clear packet pickup schedule - it's amateur hour on the communication front. The camping and shower setup sounds organized, but incomplete information kills confidence."
      },
      "adventure": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Forest trails in the North York Moors with camping and a proper weekend atmosphere has adventure potential. The technical sections and sustained climbs through Crosscliff Wood beat riding in circles around a field. It's not epic wilderness, but it's legitimate backcountry gravel with enough terrain variety to keep things interesting."
