      },
      "length": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "110km with three feed stations at 23km, 53km, and 76km intervals provides solid structure, though organizers warn riders \"do not rely solely on the feed station.\" The distance hits that middle ground where it's substantial work but won't destroy your weekend - respectable without being epic. More compact than Grinduro."
      },
      "technicality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "The \"Infamous White Cliff Rigg\" climb and technical corners through Crosscliff Wood with \"short, sharp kickers\" provide challenge, plus fast descents marked with double/triple arrows. The \"perfect Dalby gravel\" on forest access roads offers technical engagement without being intimidating. Less technical than The Mid South."

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "1800m over 110km delivers steady climbing work with the long pull up White Cliff Rigg as the main test. One elite rider noted they \"quickly ran out of steam on the relentless\" climbs, suggesting the sustained elevation gain accumulates into serious suffering without being brutal. Less climbing than The Mid South."

      "climate": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Historical weather data shows average highs of 62°F and lows of 50°F, with a 70% chance of rain on any given day. Late June in North York Moors remains a weather gamble with no historical data from this young event. Course warnings about not being \"fooled by initial flatter sections\" suggest conditions can catch riders off-guard, but the forest setting provides some shelter from typical British summer variability. More weather exposure than Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."
      },
      "altitude": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Dalby Forest sits in the North York Moors lowlands where altitude simply doesn't factor into racing considerations. The elevation profile focuses on accumulated climbing rather than high-altitude challenges - this is forest trail racing, not mountain territory. Lower altitude than Gravel Worlds — no thin-air concerns."
      },
      "adventure": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "The route through Deep Dale traverse and \"super fast descent\" into Bickley Gate climb offers varied terrain beyond typical gravel loops. \"Pristine gravel routes\" through Dalby Forest provide backcountry feel with camping options, delivering adventure potential without wilderness isolation."
      },
      "prestige": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Despite one rider noting it \"absolutely lived up to the hype,\" this remains a second-year event building reputation. The race director's claim that riders are \"craving more high-level gravel racing in the UK\" positions it ambitiously, but prestige requires time and established winners."
      },
      "race_quality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Professional timing with splits, lead vehicles for Elite categories, and industry partners like TORQ Nutrition and Wahoo suggest solid organization. One 55-59 category rider called it \"A tough but fantastic day out,\" indicating the execution is meeting expectations for a developing event."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Event village with brand expo, on-site showers, and podium ceremonies create full weekend atmosphere. The 2026 edition \"sold out within 36 hours\" to the closed community, suggesting riders are returning for the experience, though it's still building memorable traditions."
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "The inaugural 2025 edition \"drew hundreds of riders across multiple age and ability categories\" with 2026 entries selling out rapidly. The Coeliac Cyclist's critique about category systems suggests engaged discussion, while the Focal Events pedigree from Dirty Reiver brings established community connections."
      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "With a field of 100-150 riders, elite categories exist with lead vehicle support, and The Coeliac Cyclist noted issues with \"the category system\" suggesting competitive fields. However, as a second-year event, the depth remains thin compared to established races - serious riders are still discovering it exists. Thinner field than Ouray Gravel Grinder."

      "value": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "£87.50 delivers professional timing, three feed stations, mechanical support, weekend parking, showers, and event village access. With partners like Wahoo and Fenwicks providing support, plus the rapid sellout indicating demand, the price-to-service ratio shows strong value for UK gravel racing."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Entry fee of £87.50 sits reasonably for UK gravel events, with camping at £10 per night and campervan slots at £18. Required self-sufficient kit including spare tubes, tools, and nutrition adds gear costs, though free weekend parking and Dalby Forest location keep accommodation expenses manageable. Higher total cost than Badlands."

This new event threw everything at me: steep climbs, technical descents, fast riders, and the brutal reality of my lack of training.\n\nThis video captures every gritty detail of the ride — from the excitement at the start line to the suffering on the climbs and the fast-paced action on the descents. If you're into UK gravel racing, endurance cycling, or just want to see how I survived one of the toughest gravel events around, this one’s for you.\n\n#DalbyGrit #GravelRacing #cyclinguk \n\n\n\nDalby Grit Race - https://www.dalbygrit.cc\n\n\n\n🛒 Products Mentioned\nOTE Carb Drink Mix - https://amzn.to/4liqUk7\nPrecision Fuel 30 Gels - https://amzn.to/45QOvn8\nPrecision Electrolyte Tablets - https://amzn.to/4klUqEi\n\n\n\n🎬 Watch More…..\nLatest Video - https://latest.tcc.watch\nGravel Racing - https://gravel.tcc.watch\n\n\n\nPlease Subscribe -  https://www.youtube.com/@TheCoeliacCyclist?sub_confirmation=1\n\n\n\n👉 FOLLOW MY CYCLING ADVENTURES\n📸 Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/the.coeliac.cyclist/\n👍 Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/thecoeliaccyclist\n🕸️ WEBSITE - https://thecoeliaccyclist.com\n\n\n\n🕓 CHAPTERS \n0:00 Intro\n2:02 Nutrition Plan\n4:16 The Race\n13:55 Post Race Chat\n16:19 Summary\n\n\n\nPARTNERSHIP & MEDIA ENQUIRIES \n✉️ simon@thecoeliaccyclist.com \n\n\n\n📖 ABOUT ME \n\nThis channel combines my two passions, cycling and photography/videography.

          "transcript": "[Music]\neight. That is so much harder than the\nGranlock. Yeah. Yeah. The climbs are\nsteeper. Race done. Oh, here comes Dan.\nHe's been here about 3 hours, I reckon.\nDolby Grit is a new event for 2026\ncalendar. It's in Dolby Forest,\nobviously near York. Course looks good.\n4,000 m of elevation, about 110k,\nsmall loop to start us with, and then\ntwo full laps of the main course. There\nis one very steep descent followed by\nquite a steep ascent. So yeah,\ndefinitely going to test the l the legs\nmidcourse, I believe. But keen to see\nwhat the race holds. Gravel doesn't look\nas chunky as at the Growlock. Not sure\nhow I'm going to go today. There's a\ndefinitely a breeze about. There's about\na 20 mph wind. Little bit of drizzle in\nthe air, but it is forecast to be 20°\nplus. So hopefully we won't have too\nmuch trouble with the weather. So my\ntraining's been far from ideal since the\nGrowlop. I've definitely step had to\nstep down the training. busy with work,\nlittle bit of a knee niggle, and I've\nhad a bit of a saddle sore. I've had to\nget some tablets and steroid cream for\nthat. And I'm hoping it's not going to\nbe too bad today cuz it definitely ain't\nall cleared up yet. But I won't show you\npictures of that cuz nobody needs to see\nmy backside. Plenty of stands around,\nplenty of people around. Not a massive\nevent. You can hear I'm testing the\nTanoi now. Only about 400 riders, I\nthink, in my way. 52 54. There's only\nabout 40 of us, 40, 50 of us, so it's\nnot going to be too packed. There's a\nneutralized section at the start, so no\nneed to go too flat out, but I do plan\non changing up my strategy for nutrition\nfor this one. So, same as the Growlock,\nI'm running two bottles with carb\nmixing, 80 g of carb in each bottle, one\nbottle every 2 hours. So, that'll be\ngood for that. I am running my hydration\npack again, 2 L of water. I've upped the\nsodium content to a,000 mg per 500 mil.\nSo, I'm hoping that's going to stop any\ncramping. And unlike the Growlock, if\nyou haven't seen that video, check it\nout. Link in the description where I\ndidn't drink the whole thing and came\nback with a liter. I will be drinking it\nall because it's a lapped course, you go\npast the feed station three times in\ntotal. So, if I do run out, I've got\nsome extra tablets with me that I can\npop in me bottles and get some more\nsodium in if I run out of drinks.\nHaven't got to make it last. I've\nactually got to make it not last and\nalmost hope I fill up because then I\nthink I'll have got the hydration right\non that side. Um I'm using precision\nhydration gels again. Same ones as\nnormal. 30 g of carbs, one of them every\nhour. So that is going to give me about\n60 to 70 g of carbs per hour. So I think\nI'll be well fueled. I've also got my\nfavorite\ngluten-free OT bars. Got a couple of\nthose. So hopefully I can get some\nsolids in depending on the course, but\nthere is some small sections of road on\neach lap. So that'll be an ideal\nopportunity to get some solids in.\nBike's all ready to go.\nSame tires, 50 mil Swelby RX.\nRunning them a little bit higher on\npressure this time cuz the gravel's not\nquite so severe. So, I'm running those\nat 28 in the rear and 25 on the front.\nSo, nothing too obscene, but a little\nbit more pressure. Still got the tire\nliners in there. Probably get away with\na bit less tread on this course, I\nthink. Not ridden it yet, but that's\nwhat I'm thinking and what I've been\ntold. But these are already on there. I\ndidn't want to lash out for more tires,\nso that'll do for the time being. Didn't\nsleep too bad in the van. Got the setup\npretty dialed now. Woke back on a few\nbits. might do a separate video on that.\nPut comments down below if you want to\nsee a separate video of the van setup\nand how I carry the bikes around and\nwhat I've got and the sleep setup in\nthere. You had to be in the start pens\nfor 900 a.m. Everyone was ready, as you\ncan see. Not large numbers, 319\ncompetitors, 52 in my age group, and we\nset off in a neutralized zone at the\nstart of the race. The reason for this\nis you go around the grass sort of start\nfield start area and then it does just\nnarrow as we go through the trees onto\nthe road which is still in the\nneutralized section. So as you can see\npeople try to move up maybe jostling a\nlittle bit position but everything at\nthis stage is quite casual and I'm\nthinking right this is good. Not feeling\ntoo bad. I've really not done that much\ntraining. I had considered not actually\neven doing the event because I really\nhaven't done any long long rides. Now,\nwe've just gone past the end of the\nneutralized zone. And as you'll see,\npace hasn't picked up too much. Showing\nthe watts I'm putting out here on the\nleft hand side. You ain't going to see\nnothing amazing there, guys. And the\nspeed and also the distance that I've\ntraveled during the race. As we come\naround the corner, things definitely\nstart to ramp up a bit. And you can see\nI've already had to put in a 700 W\neffort there. Little blow from me. And\nI'm thinking, God, these guys are\nactually hitting this out. And this is\ngoing to be pretty rapid. Now, I'd gone\noff a bit too slow at the Growlock. You\ncan check out that video. Links in the\ndescription. And I thought I don't want\nto make the same mistake here. So, I am\ngoing to go with these guys a little bit\nat the start and just see how I feel,\nhow my legs are feeling, what I've got\nin me really, because I really didn't\nknow from the training I've done how\nmuch has still stayed with me. I know my\nwatts has dropped. I'm down to 245.\nI was at 258 for the Growlock, so I have\nlost a bit, which is understandable cuz\nI've had time off the bike. Not too\nworried. I want to have a good day out,\nbut the pace is pretty rapid with these\nguys. Like I say, field wasn't massive,\nbut the people that had turned out for\nthis event, they would have hit us for\nsure. You can see we're going past some\nuh the tail end of the previous group,\nthe age group that's already gone off.\nAnd you can see I'm already getting\ndistanced because I'm thinking I can't\nhold this pace for this long. I've got\nto sit up a little bit now.\nUnfortunately, little bit of bounce on\nthe old um 360 camera in this video. Not\nfor too long, thankfully, but it did\nactually snap at the mount. In arguments\nwith Insta about that now as they're\ndebating on whether you should be able\nto use their camera off-road. I will\nupdate you on that, guys. Anyway, we\nturn right onto another off-road\nsection. And the first part is very much\nlike right 90° right turn down a\nstraight bit, 90° left turn down a\nstraight bit as we zig around the\nforest. But we soon settle in to a much\nmore flow and course. And the 90° turns\npretty much end after this section where\nwe go on to road. I get up out of the\nsaddle again. Another big effort put in\nthere. 500 W. But I am picking up some\nof the guys that probably also tried to\ngo with the group and thought, \"No, that\nain't for them either.\" And you can see\nI'm picking them up from my group and\nmaybe from the previous group that was\nin the pen in front as well. The\nlandscape is amazing. The gravel is\ngood. It's pretty much a fine gravel.\nThere's a couple of single track\nsections. This is one here that's quite\nsmooth. few BMS but they were quite dry\nso I didn't feel you could really get\ninto the BMS too well. Then we got\npicked up by the age group behind and\nthese guys again they were flying along.\nUm and we tried to stick with them. I\nwas with a couple of other guys at this\nstage that I just picked up but they\nwere hammering. I thought that ain't for\nme as we enter the other single track\nbit. Now this bit was hellishly bumpy.\nReally bumpy. And there's another bumpy\nstage here. So, there are a couple of\nrough bits where I was glad I actually\nhad my 50 cm, 50 mil tires, but for most\nof it, 45s were probably faster on the\nday, I'd have said tirewise. Hey guys,\nvery well marshaled. Two stations, one\nfeed station, one where you could get\nwater. So, some of the first age group\nladies have just come past me, four of\nthem. Super quick. And then they've got\none of the vets on the rear getting a\ntoe. Not a done thing to me, but never\nmind.\nWhat do you guys think? Let me know in\nthe comments below. Should people be\njumping on the women or should they just\nstay out of their race? Now, this road\nsection was very steep, well over 15%.\nAnd I was zigzagging across the hill\njust to make it a bit easier for myself.\nGreat job, mate. Thank you. Well done.\nSee you later. Ah, yeah. Yeah, you will.\nI know. Sorry about that. No, I look\nforward to it.\nFinal lap.\nThe 360 died. The mounts broke. It's got\nto go back to Insta. Uh, my legs have\ndied. I'm trying to work out if I went\ntoo hard at the start or just lack of\ntraining. I think it's just lack of\ntraining and and my conditioning where\nI'm at. But I'm still enjoying it. I'm\nstill mixing it around with people,\npassing people, getting past. There's\nsome fast people out here. Obviously,\nthere's some less fast people out here.\nOf course, it's good.\nStill got\nsecond time of the massive descent and\nthe really steep climb, but\njust ticking it off and getting it done.\nGot about 20 mile to go, I think. So, uh\nprobably 22. So, let's get it done.\nI must say I did enjoy some of the\nlovely descents.\nCheers, mate.\n[Applause]\nSo, obviously after that, it's going to\nbe the climb back up and you get a nice\ndescent, then you get the climb back up.\nAnyway, if you're enjoying this one,\nmake sure to subscribe cuz next weekend\nI'm in France at the tour. Going to go\nand watch the first three stages. We'll\ndefinitely be uploading videos hopefully\nthe following day after each stage. So,\nuh definitely if you haven't already,\nhit subscribe, like this video, and I'll\nbring you some more content. Anyway, I\nstill got to get this race finished. So,\nI don't know what I'm chatting about\nnext weekend for. Better crack on. So, I\njust been passed by another bloke\ndrafting a lady again. Hold on.\nHe's up there,\nguys. You ain't in their race. I mean,\nit's like open or female. What you born\nat birth? So, you ain't in the race.\nLeave them alone. Stay out of the way.\nIf they've caught you, let them bite.\nDon't be trying to draft them. It's rude\nand basically it's cheating. So I don't\nagree with it and I'm going to call\npeople out on it. So I just don't think\nyou do it. I just let them buy. Say well\ndone. They're faster than me. I'm nearly\n50. I got nothing to prove. It's just\nabout enjoying yourself.\nAnyway, I'm struggling. 15 to go. Here\nwas another big descent. This one was\nthe biggest off-road fast descent. Very\nlong. And as you came up to this tight\nhand, right-hander, you really needed to\nget on the brakes as I found out the\nfirst time I went through because then\nit's a very tight left hand. And\nunfortunately, this guy sitting on the\nroad ahead. Hadn't spotted it and he'd\ncome across. He looked a bit of a mess.\nPoor guy.\nAll right.\nPoor steep descent. Poor guy at the\nbottom. Looks like he's broke his\ncollarbone. He's well grazed up.\nHopefully he's all right. So hopefully\nit's nothing too serious and he's back\non the bike now. We got a little bit of\ngravel climbing and then the world's\nsteepest road climb. So we'll see\nhow long left. 11.3 mi and 679 ft of\nclimbment to go. Uh let's see how we do.\nDespite feeling completely tired on that\nsecond lap, I did manage a good sprint\nfurther finish just to finish this one\noff and I did enjoy it. It's a great\nevent,\nmate. Come on. Come on. Come on. Stop.\nStop. Stop. Here we go. All right. Yeah.\nYeah. Yeah. Who did that route with all\nthem hills? Well, that's steep. It's\nlike they kept it secret from you before\nyou start.\nWell, yeah.\nThank you. Well done, mate. You did\ngreat. Well done, mate. Thanks. That is\nso much harder than the ground. Yeah.\nYeah. The climbs are steeper. Same\nclimbing feet, but way steeper. Good\nthough. That was good course.\nGood course. enjoyed that race done. Oh,\nhere comes Dan. He's been here about 3\nhours, I reckon. How long you been here,\nDan?\nA little while, I reckon. Anyway, man,\nI'm slaughtered. You all right? How did\nyou do? Good. Good. Yeah, not too bad.\nIt's under 4 hours.\nAnd it took me like five. No, it's 4:49.\nSo, 4 minutes longer than the Growlock.\nYeah. But I think it's harder. I don't\nknow what you use for, but you probably\ndidn't cuz obviously you still get a\ngood time. I think the terrain's just as\nhard, but the surfaces are better. Yeah,\nsurface is better, but the climbs are\njust stead.\nYeah.\nTwice. Yeah, that was hard. That was\nhard. You did all right then. Where's F?\nYou must be well up there if you don't\nknow yet. Check. You must have done well\nnow. That went off so quick. I went off\ntoo quick and killed myself. I didn't go\noff fast enough at the Growlock. Here I\nwent with the fast boys. Not for too\nlong, but too long. Yeah.\nI I stuck to the front loop until the\nend with the first um bit of a sort of\n22k. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Starting loop.\nYeah. And then I just couldn't fix them\nanymore. Just going to kill yourself. I\nwas in a nice group for that lap. And\nthen I stopped to pick bottles up\nagainst them. But then I But then I\npicked the next group up. No problem.\npick four out of that group. Oh, that's\nall right. Swagglers, they they passed\nthem. So, I probably didn't finish too.\nNo, you probably did all right then.\nProbably within the top 10 probably. Too\nfar out of that group. Nah, that's good.\nGood result, man. Yeah, that's a\nthat's tough.\nI can see I've lost uh fitness and\npower. Definitely.\nBut I enjoyed it. Bike felt better. Fit\nwas better. So, I'm moving forward, but\nI just got to pace them wrong the other\nway. But I've got no liquid left in the\nhydration pack and an extra bottle. So,\nI that bit sorted. I'm happy. You see\nAndy coming yet? I haven't seen him. No,\nI waited a little shower. Has he come by\nme fairly quickly, did he? Yeah. Now, I\ndidn't see him. He didn't pass me, but I\nwaited there for a bit, had a coffee,\nthen I went rode up and got my bottles.\nYeah. Come back, had a shower.\nYeah. I'm going to have a shower. I'm\ngoing to wash me bike, I think. Have a\nshower\nand then think about making. So, Dolby\ngrip done. That was hard, man. I'm\ndefinitely not as fit as I was for the\nGrowlop. I didn't focus on this one as\nmuch, but the climbing was the equal.\nStill 4,000 foot of climbing, but they\nwere just steep climbs. Way steeper. So,\nGrow is much more undulating. This was\njust steep climbs. Some of the road one,\nthe road climb, unbelievable. Everyone\nwas saying, \"Man, that was hard.\" They\nwere going from side to side like I was.\nPretty tough.\nDidn't do the time I wanted. Don't think\nI ever do. But yeah, 449. So, a little\nbit slower than Growlock, but probably\nto be expected with my fitness where it\nis. Bike felt more comfortable. I'm\ndefinitely a lot happier with the setup\non my bike. So, that's definitely\nworking. Nutrition worked really well.\nReally happy with my nutrition. Got in\nall the carbs I needed. So, I think I\ndid five gels in total with one at the\nstart and then four druin. Uh, two bars\nand\ntwo bottles of 80 g worth of carbs in\nthe drink. So, I'll top that up and put\nthat on the screen what it was the\nbreakdown for you. Um, plenty of sodium.\nAgain, I'll top that up for you and I'll\nput links in the description to the\nproducts I've used. If you're\ninterested, have a look at them. I've\ntried lots of different ones and they\nwork really well for me. And obviously,\neverything I use is gluten-free. So you\ngot that benefit and a lot of that then\nmeans that it's actually vegan free. Oh,\nyou can feel the wind. It was definitely\nwindy out there at times. I didn't have\nany more in the legs.\nI'll probably definitely be back next\nyear. I'm hoping this event is going to\nget bigger, but at the moment I'm\ndefinitely saying this is one of the\nhardest\ngravel races in the UK. Might not be the\nhardest gravel event, but for a race, I\nreckon this is one of the hardest. So,\nif you want to try something and\nchallenge yourself, look out for this\none next year.\nIf you've enjoyed the video, please\nlike, subscribe.

          "transcript": "Good morning. Hello. It's Daniel and\nthis is the Derby Grit 2025. Now, I know\nthis channel says triathlon dam, but\nthis is a gravel race. It's 110 km. It's\nabout 5,000 ft of climbing. There's\nthree laps, one short lap and two long\nlaps. I need to remember that. About\n360ome entrance in total, and it's the\nfirst year that the event's ran, so it's\na bit of an unknown as to how it's going\nto go and how competitive it's going to\nbe. But, I'm looking forward to a good\nday out. I'm just going to get stuck in\nand try and get the best performance out\nof myself. The environment's already\nbeen pretty cool and gravel racing in\nthe UK is really welcoming. I speak like\nthe vibes of gravel, but genuinely the\npeople seem great and it's just a good\nplace to be. So, I'm looking forward to\nracing with some fellow guys and girls\ntoday and getting stuck in cuz it is it\nis an actual race. It's listed as a\nrace. Right. We need to start getting\nthe start line. Okay. So, we are go go.\nBut please let me explain why I'm riding\nlike I am. So earlier this year I did\nanother gravel race and I started off at\nthe front and I got dropped very quickly\nand that's fine, but I'm going to try\nand change the things that that are\nwithin my control. So how you start a\nrace, how you position yourself and how\nyou ride in the first few hundred meters\ncan affect how long you last towards the\nfront or not. So my plan was just to\nwhack it basically. This is a\nneutralized roll out. I'm doing air\nquotes around the word neutralized\nbecause this was very hard. Uh but I did\nactually get a little gap on the rest of\nthe field doing this. I wasn't really\nlooking behind me. I just wanted to\nsurge on cuz in my mind I'm just going\nto get swamped in a minute anyway\nregardless of how hard I'm riding. So I\nwas surprised to have a gap to be\nhonest. But you know, happy nonetheless.\nUh the road flattened out here now and\nI've got over that first little climb. I\nwas really happy with that. Uh but then\nI was keen to not just get swamped by\nlots of riders. I knew that I didn't\nwant to just sit on the front. I needed\nto be fifth, sixth wheel, but I didn't\nwant to end up 20th wheel after having\nput in a big surge. Now, this race is\nthree laps and the first lap is 22 km\nand it is mostly flat. So, um I'm 100\nkilos. My threshold power is about 320,\n330 W, something around there. Those\nnumbers don't make me good enough to be\nat the front at the end of this race.\nBut I was hoping they might be good\nenough for me to be somewhere near the\nfront relevantish on that flat lap.\nAlthough I'm not in the best shape I've\never been in by some way, I still have\nthat like racing mentality. I love\nracing my bike. I want to be in the mix.\nI want to be relevant. I know that I\ncan't be there for the whole race. So,\nmy target was to just get stuck in for\nthe first lap and then, you know, take\nit as it comes after that. So, I've\ndropped down to what now? Like seventh\nor eighth wheel. I'm kicking on hard out\nof these corners, but I am just losing a\nbit of ground. It's not the end of the\nworld. In the first few miles, it was\nquite twisty. Quite a lot of, you know,\n90° lefts and rights. It was going to\nstring the field out. I think the\norganizer actually designed that in a\nway to do that. Then there was a section\nof single tracking, not many miles as\nwell, just to try and string the field\nout. just make it safer. Particularly\nwhen it is a flat route, you don't want\nto be in a bunch of near 40 odd riders.\nAgain, just another 90° right turn here.\nJust bunches everybody up, then just\nstrings it out, and then gaps will start\nopening usually in front of me. There we\nare. But I'm pedaling as hard as I can.\nThis section here, I would love to just\njump across to the right and try and get\non that guy's wheel, but it's not as\neasy to just jump across the middle of a\nlane like this. You don't know how rough\nit is, and when you're doing 40ks an\nhour, it's not the safest. You don't\nknow who's next to you, behind you, and\nso on. So I just car pot there son uh\njust you know didn't want to start doing\nany of that messing around when\nespecially when I had a bit of a\ntailwind down here so it wasn't that\nmuch extra to be pedalling yourself the\nleft hand bend I thought I cornered this\none quite well didn't really lose any\npositions in the corner but again just\non the way out just just losing a bit of\nground but I'm giving it everything I've\ngot and I'm still thinking well I I know\nthat there's not a breakaway you know\nI'm still in the front group it's just a\nbig front group and I'm just noting that\nmaybe I need to try and move up when I\ncan. But this is hard. The first 5\nminutes I think I normalized 360\nsomething W, which is a hard effort for\nme. So, uh, you know, it was a a tough\nworkout. Onto the road now. And this is\nwhere I was thinking, right, I can try\nand move up a few positions here. But I\nthink perhaps tire selection was a\nlittle bit of an issue. Obviously, this\nis the tires are the main reason why I'm\ngetting dropped here. The main reason is\nmy fitness, but I was using some\nSchwabby Thunderbirds and on the tarmac.\nThey're they're the worst out of, you\nknow, gravel tires and mountain bike\ntires really. um I would have been\nfaster on a gravel tire with a you know\nsolid bead down the middle but on the\noff-road stuff I was confident that my\nsetup was was pretty good. So just meant\nI was just losing a few positions on the\nroad. But um yeah, as I say I think\nthere's probably a handful of watts in\nthat and probably tens of watts in my uh\nnot great fitness at the minute. Uh\nthanks to the marshalss who were out all\nday whenever we were crossing any road\nsections like this. I felt really really\nsafe. Awesome. Thank you very much for\nthe support and to the volunteers.\nThere's a few sections like this. It's a\nlittle bit of single track, a little bit\nof rougher stuff, but not too much. Uh,\ndid a few miles on my own actually then\nand then before I end up getting\nswallowed up by this group. And this is\nthe first section of single track. So,\nbit of a bottleneck. You only actually\nlose like 10 seconds here maximum. And\nthis is basically a little bit of a\nfight just to get onto the single track.\nNow, I wasn't going to fight anybody for\nit. Being a triathlete, I'm not going to\nbe setting the pace down this sort of\nsegment, but I did want to be like in a\ngroup and try and stay with a group.\nWhen I got onto this section, I had to\nput my foot down there. And I was like,\ndamn it, I can't post this video of a\ntriathlete was getting dropped on the\nsingle track. So, I need to give\neverything I've got here, you know,\ntechnique-wise and fitness- wise, just\nto try and stay on this group. And I\nactually did. I closed this gap up a\nlittle bit more. And I would say I exit\nthis single track in that group. And I\nwas really happy with that. And this is\njust such good fun. I'd ridden it in the\npre-ride the day before, so I sort of\nknew the route, but it flows different\nat race pace. and being able to see the\nlines that people are taking in front of\nyou that the wide angle lens blows it\nout further than it actually is makes\nyou able to, you know, ride these bits\nfaster. And it was really good fun. It's\nthe first time I've had this sort of\nterrain in a gravel race. So, yeah, it\nwas good. And this section here, we're\nactually going the opposite way to\nriders, you know, in the race as well.\nAnd when I saw like the event briefing,\nI was a bit concerned about that. But\nactually, because you're so strung out,\nit wasn't a problem at all. It's really\nwell marked. Everybody knows there's\ngoing to be riders coming the opposite\nway, so you just stick to the right and\nand that was it. And I think we went the\nthis this way for maybe 400 m maximum.\nWhen we get to this next corner, they\nthe other riders are coming from the\nleft and we go to the right. So it's not\na problem at all really. It looked worse\nin the handbook than it does ride an\nactual race day. Been dropped again. Um\nso a little bit further on. This guy is\nthe definition of gravel. And he\nactually came past me and said, \"Come\non, jump on.\" Like you know, fair play.\nA little bit of encouragement sometimes.\nAll you need. Uh he's got the gravel\nsort of skin suit on. And he's got like\nthe semi- arero gravel socks from Rule\n28. I've seen they're pretty cool. Um\nand yeah, points out potholes and so on.\nI think he was riding the NV mog as\nwell, which is a pretty cool gravel\nbike. But I went with him for a mile or\ntwo, but as soon as it got lumpy again,\nhe dropped me. But um it's really cool\ndoing stuff like this. I enjoy it. I\nthink it, you know, feels good to feel\nlike I'm in a race even if I'm not. This\nwas probably one of the more technical\nsections through somebody's farmard.\nThank you for letting us use that that\nroad if you if it is an option. Um, a\nlittle bit rougher, a little bit twisty\nturny, just thinking about the riders\nthat are around you. But it's such a\ngood buzz doing this. Nobody here is\ntrying to like bump elbows and run each\nother off the road. We're all just\ntrying to have a safe ride. And it flows\nreally well. This section was super\nfast. 66 ks an hour on gravel downhill.\nUh, if I'd known how fast I was going, I\nperhaps wouldn't have been going this\nfast, but because you just got your eyes\nglued to the road ahead. And I think I'm\nactually descending okay here. It's all\nwell and good descending fast until you\nend up in a ditch. But I was feeling\nlike it was flowing well and like I had\nbig enough gaps around me to other\npeople. Trusted the brakes, trusted the\ntires and all of that. So, um, yeah, it\nwas going good. However, the bottom\nhere, this is the bit that I hadn't\nwrecked. We're now on the, you know, the\nlarger lap, the hillier lap. I knew\nthere was a corner coming up, but I\ncouldn't quite see it. And I'm locking\nup here. Same as the guy in front. He\ncan't stop. Can't stop. And just\novershot it and just, you know, come to\na come to a halt. If I known that was\ncoming, of course, you'd take the inside\nline and be carrying some speed and all\nof that. This was nasty. This was a\nsuper steep road section and I actually\nstarted zigzagging very soon just to get\nup the damn thing. Something's gone\nwrong with my power meter there. I was\ndefinitely doing more than 60 watts to\nget up there. But this was awful. And on\nthe on this on the first time we're\ndoing it to have to do it twice. I was\nthinking, God, this is going to be a\nslog the next time around. But you know,\nyou just got to break it down in your\nhead and just keep riding. And to be\nhonest, I was thinking, well, it might\nnot be the end of the world if I\nactually get just stopped at the A\nstation. I'm absolutely saturated now.\nJust struggling so much in the heat. I\nmust have just drank like a liter of\nwater and pulled the saber over me. Got\nabout 20 mi left. I just needed to cool\ndown a bit. I was getting way too hot.\nLet's get this thing finished. So yeah,\nI was just suffering in the heat. But\nlike so many people when you got to the\nfinish line, they were all talking about\nhow hard they found it with it being\nquite a cloudy day. I don't think\nanybody had really thought about it\nbeing that hot, myself included. And it\njust, you know, really bit after a\ncouple of hours. I had a real rough\npatch about 3 hours in where, you know,\nI was struggling to turn the pedals,\nlike never mind race or anything. And\nthen a little bit further on here now, I\nwas feeling a lot better. I'd, you know,\nobviously dunk loads of water myself and\ndrank loads and so on, but was still\njust struggling to hold the wheels of\nanybody that came by, but I was just\ndetermined to finish it. I think, you\nknow, my main events coming up later\nthis year are like Iron Man triathlons\nand they're long days out and it's all\nabout the mental resilience rather than\nactually being physically fit. So, I\njust tried to settle into the power of\ndoing 200ish watts and just keep moving.\nI wasn't too fussed if anybody came past\nme or if I wasn't going very fast. It\nwas just going to keep moving and the\nfinish would come in not too far. Even\nhere when a couple of riders come past\nme like they're going past me so slowly.\nI should be able to just surge on and\nget on their wheels, but I just just\ncouldn't do it. Just I felt like I was\nat my limit. I'm doing like 150 watts.\nLike that was all I had to give. So, I\nwas just trying not to let that affect\nme mentally too much and just try and\nenjoy the rest of the ride. And that's\nthat's what I did basically. So, thanks\nto the organizers, thanks for the\nvolunteers and I had a brilliant day at\nthe Del Grit. I'll definitely back next\nyear. Oh man, race done and dusted. I\nreally suffered and if I'm honest, when\nI was on that last lap, if I'd have\nknown the way back here, I might have\ntook it. I really had a rough patch\nmentally and it's just reiterated to me\nthat this is so mental this game. If you\nlose it up here, it's very easy to throw\nthe whole thing away. Just talking to a\ncouple of people who DNF. So interested\nto see where I am in my age group.\nThere's only 68 or 69 starters. But I\nwas no idea if I proper struggle towards\nthe end. But just such a good day out.\nIt's good training. It's good racing.\nIt's good vibes. We've got bike wash\nzone over there. We've got all various\ndifferent stands, food, drink, and so\non. It is these are good events and you\nknow compared to triathons, a lot more\naccessible costwise especially because\nyou can like the bike I've ridden. I\ncould train on that. I could race on\nthat. One bike does it all. Anyway, I'm\ngoing to try and get cleaned up. Look at\nthe state of me and get",

          "transcript": "Good morning and welcome to a fairly\nsmoky Dolby Forest. So, just parked up\nand what I thought I'd do in this video\nis just go and show you some of my local\ngravel routes that I do quite often\naround the forest, the gravel roads, and\njust peeking into the North Yorkshire\nmoss a little bit. I'm here with my\nfriend Andrew who has just picked up an\nelectric higher bike. So, I'll show you\nthat as well in the video. He's just\nbehind me. You can see him there.\nAnd yeah, we're so we're gonna do a bit\nof uh Dolby forest, go up into the\nbottom of the moors, um and yeah, show\nyou show you all the cool gravel tracks\nthat uh exist around here. And it's a\nlittle bit smoky today because there is\na big fire up in the north of the Moors\nand the wind has blown it all down last\nnight. So hopefully it's not too\nsmokeoky. You probably can't see it on\nthe camera, but you can definitely smell\nit.\nThere's Andy now with his Orbeea ebike.\nSo yeah, to start off we are just going\non the green route and we're going to\nhead out sort of towards Fort Lale. You\ncan see here we're just kind of in the\nforests and then we do a climb for about\ntwo or three miles to get to the top of\nuh the forest and then from there we can\nsort of skirt around the top and start\nmaking our way into the moss proper.\nAll right, we are just onto this sort of\nlike main climb of the day that takes us\nto the top. So, you can see it's 2.8\nmiles, but only 600 feet. So, it's it's\nnot steep. Just goes on for a long time.\n[Applause]\n[Music]\nRight, we're just on this trail now.\nWe've just gone the wrong way.\nKind of gone the wrong way. The trail's\nclosed that we're supposed to be on. So,\nwe're just using this little little nice\ntrack to jump back up to the main track.\nThat should get us around.\nAll right. So, we have now left kind of\nDolby forest, the proper Dolby Forest\narea, and we're just on the forest sort\nof logging roads. We take you up into\nthe moors now, and the smoke has pretty\nmuch all gone away. It is supposed to be\nblowing the other way to us, so it seems\nlike it's all pretty much settled in the\nforest, but up here, it's nice and clean\nair, which is good news.\ncan.\nRight, we're now at the most sort of\nnorthwest point of the route that we're\ngoing to do today, which is actually the\nclosest to the forest fire. And you've\nactually started to be able to smell it\na bit in the air. Also feels wet in the\nair. So it's like a little bit of rain\nor or something. Although Andy has a\ntheory that maybe it is from the the the\nhelicopters that are dropping water and\nit's blowing over, which I guess it\ncould do. We have seen one helicopter\nfly over. Um I missed it so I didn't\nmanage to capture it on camera. So we\nmight see another one. But yeah, they're\ndropping water on the forest fire. So\nyeah, you can smell the smoke a bit up\nhere. It's not too bad. But we're going\nto descend back down now. So, we should\nget out of it pretty soon. One good\nthing is we think it's because of the\nfire, but all the gates and all the\nforest roads have been open, which is uh\nis really nice. So, yeah, there's a\npositive.\nThat gate, it's nice when it's open.\nHere\nwe are.\nWe've just stopped here at the monastery\njust uh we're about to go up to Brox\nnow. We just followed the bowser\nactually which um was coming from the\nfire. They must be coming this way to\ntry and pick up water. I don't know\nwhere they're picking up water from. Any\nideas?\n&gt;&gt; Y water.\n&gt;&gt; Y water. Um, but yeah, just stopping at\nthe monastery which has got all these\nreally creepy statues. You can just see\none there just like the Doctor Who\nweeping angels. But yeah, now we're\ngoing to go along the road a little bit\nand then up towards um place called\nBroxer and then we will go around and\ndown to a little village that actually\nthe road is a stream in winter. So we'll\ngo down there and and film that. But it\nshould be dry today cuz it was dry last\nweek.\nWe've just stopped. We're on the way to\nthis um road. What's the stream? Um but\nit should be dry like I said. And uh\nAndrew's just had his first ever gel.\nHow was that?\n&gt;&gt; Horrible.\n&gt;&gt; He had an SIS gel, the regular ones, and\nthey are pretty horrible. Um thought I'd\nquickly show the bike that he's on,\nwhich is an ARA Wild. It's either a H30\nor H20. We're not sure. Um, it's got the\nlatest Bosch CX motor and it's got a DR\ngroup set on it, suspension, Fox rear\nsuspension. I don't really know anything\nabout mountain bikes, so whatever that\nis. And I think they're Fox forks as\nwell.\nAnd uh, yeah, I think over the years\nwe've rented quite a few electric bikes\num, between us. Well, I've only rented\none, an AA lightweight one. Andrew's\nrented a couple of these. What else you\nrated? Trex. Uh, you've had a cube, a\nwhite\n&gt;&gt; at Sen Bank.\n&gt;&gt; Sutton Bank of various ages. Like you've\nhad the old Bosch motors, the new Bosch\nmotors. Um, and I think we're in\nagreement that the Wild is by far the\nbest bike overall. Easiest to ride.\nLatest Bosch motor is super nice, super\nsmooth. Yeah, it's a nice bike. It just\nlooks a bit poor in black.\n&gt;&gt; We've done 23 miles and used.\nYeah, 23 miles used one bar. Does have a\nbit of range anxiety, so we're not in\nthe fastest mode, but we've only been\ngoing really slow anyway, so it doesn't\nreally matter.\nYeah, superb. So, yeah, we'll do this\ndescent and then we just have to go back\nup to the top of Dolby Forest, which is\na really steep road that is tarmac, but\nthen it does turn to gravel at the top.\nAnd then from there we will just go sort\nof across top of the forest and then\ndown back to the visitor center and to\nthe cafe.\nOh my. Oh my.\nWe've just got to the the place where\nthere is like the first stream at the\nnorth and there's going to be another\nstream shortly down the road. And this\nis where when they run high, the stream\nactually runs down the road. But there\nis a bridge that you can use if you\ndon't want to ride through the stream,\nwhich I'm going to do cuz I don't want\nto get all water and all my bearings and\nstuff. But it's not deep. But Andrew\ndoesn't trust me. Unfortunately, he has\ngot a heavy ebike and wide bars.\nThat in winter is the stream. There's a\nlittle bit of water.\n&gt;&gt; And then this is where the end of the\nstream is. You can see it goes off down\nthere.\nSo, yeah, it's really, really cool. Um,\nit's not so cool when you come across it\nin winter and you're on your bike and\nyou end up having to ride through it,\nbut it's cool when you know about it.\nWe've done the last proper climb now,\nwhich is pretty steep. It gets up to\nlike 20%. But we're just going down this\ngravel track now. And then we will join\nup to there's a little car park. Then we\nhave this really gradual ascent um which\nis it used to be pretty bogggy but\nthey've actually relayed it all. So\nthey've smoothed it all off and put new\ngravel down. So that's really nice. And\nthen after that we only had just a few\nmiles down to Dolby Cafe where we will\nhopefully have a drink and quick bite to\neat.\nHow you feeling?\n&gt;&gt; Three and a half bars left.\n&gt;&gt; Three and a half I've been too uh too\ncareful with me\n&gt;&gt; range. Oh,\n&gt;&gt; put it in turbo to the end.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. All\nright, we're now back at All right,\nwe're now back at the visitor center. It\nis packed here now. There's so many\ncars. It was empty when we got here this\nmorning. How many bars left in your\nebike, Andy?\n&gt;&gt; Three bars out of five. sick.\n&gt;&gt; He's not been utilizing it properly.\n&gt;&gt; Purple all the way around.\n&gt;&gt; I'm going to have a quick spin on it,\nbut we're going to go to the cafe first.\nBut yeah, that's going to be the end of\nthis video. Thanks for watching and\ncatch you in the next one.",

Riders describe steeper climbs than comparable events, with a particularly challenging steep descent followed by a steep ascent midcourse. The course includes chunky gravel sections, twisty 90-degree turns, single track designed to string out the field, and some road sections ideal for nutrition. Weather conditions include 20mph winds with potential drizzle but temperatures above 20 degrees. The race attracts around 400 riders total with 40-50 per age group, creating an intimate atmosphere. The neutralized start is described as very hard with opportunities for strong riders to gain early gaps. Course features both forest roads and sections extending into the North Yorkshire Moors, with generally less severe gravel than other major UK gravel events."
