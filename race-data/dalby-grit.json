The Coeliac Cyclist noted this was their \"first elite gravel race at Dalby Grit\" suggesting the event is attracting riders, though no specified start times or clear packet pickup schedules appear in official communications."
      },
      "length": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "110km with three feed stations at 23km, 53km, and 76km intervals provides solid structure, though organizers warn riders \"do not rely solely on the feed station.\" The distance hits that middle ground where it's substantial work but won't destroy your weekend - respectable without being epic."
      },
      "technicality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "The \"Infamous White Cliff Rigg\" climb and technical corners through Crosscliff Wood with \"short, sharp kickers\" provide challenge, plus fast descents marked with double/triple arrows. The \"perfect Dalby gravel\" on forest access roads offers technical engagement without being intimidating."
      },
      "elevation": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "1800m over 110km delivers steady climbing work with the long pull up White Cliff Rigg as the main test. One elite rider noted they \"quickly ran out of steam on the relentless\" climbs, suggesting the sustained elevation gain accumulates into serious suffering without being brutal."
      },
      "climate": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Late June in North York Moors remains a weather gamble with no historical data from this young event. Course warnings about not being \"fooled by initial flatter sections\" suggest conditions can catch riders off-guard, but the forest setting provides some shelter from typical British summer variability."
      },
      "altitude": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Dalby Forest sits in the North York Moors lowlands where altitude simply doesn't factor into racing considerations. The elevation profile focuses on accumulated climbing rather than high-altitude challenges - this is forest trail racing, not mountain territory."
      },
      "adventure": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "The route through Deep Dale traverse and \"super fast descent\" into Bickley Gate climb offers varied terrain beyond typical gravel loops. \"Pristine gravel routes\" through Dalby Forest provide backcountry feel with camping options, delivering adventure potential without wilderness isolation."
      },
      "prestige": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Despite one rider noting it \"absolutely lived up to the hype,\" this remains a second-year event building reputation. The race director's claim that riders are \"craving more high-level gravel racing in the UK\" positions it ambitiously, but prestige requires time and established winners."
      },
      "race_quality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Professional timing with splits, lead vehicles for Elite categories, and industry partners like TORQ Nutrition and Wahoo suggest solid organization. One 55-59 category rider called it \"A tough but fantastic day out,\" indicating the execution is meeting expectations for a developing event."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Event village with brand expo, on-site showers, and podium ceremonies create full weekend atmosphere. The 2026 edition \"sold out within 36 hours\" to the closed community, suggesting riders are returning for the experience, though it's still building memorable traditions."
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "The inaugural 2025 edition \"drew hundreds of riders across multiple age and ability categories\" with 2026 entries selling out rapidly. The Coeliac Cyclist's critique about category systems suggests engaged discussion, while the Focal Events pedigree from Dirty Reiver brings established community connections."
      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Elite categories exist with lead vehicle support, and The Coeliac Cyclist noted issues with \"the category system\" suggesting competitive fields. However, as a second-year event, the depth remains thin compared to established races - serious riders are still discovering it exists."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "£87.50 delivers professional timing, three feed stations, mechanical support, weekend parking, showers, and event village access. With partners like Wahoo and Fenwicks providing support, plus the rapid sellout indicating demand, the price-to-service ratio shows strong value for UK gravel racing."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Entry fee of £87.50 sits reasonably for UK gravel events, with camping at £10 per night and campervan slots at £18. Required self-sufficient kit including spare tubes, tools, and nutrition adds gear costs, though free weekend parking and Dalby Forest location keep accommodation expenses manageable."
