        "explanation": "Heidi successfully descended at 43mph on loose gravel using a 2012 cyclocross bike with cantilever brakes and 32mm tires, noting 'I railed the descents.' Jeffrey describes one climb as '9-12% max grade for about a quarter mile' marked with a 'can we still be friends' sign. Challenging but manageable on standard gravel setups."
      },
      "elevation": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "The 100-mile course climbs to 6,516 feet with Jeffrey noting 'long grindy uphills' throughout his 103-mile route. Heidi describes the 40-mile as starting with 'eight miles of pavement to get us warmed up' before hitting 'the first big climb of the day' immediately on gravel. Steady climbing without soul-crushing mega-ascents."
      },
      "climate": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Weather swings wildly year to year. Heidi's 2019 race was blazing hot: 'The still air combined with my black skin suit and hot sun made me want to melt.' Jeffrey's 2022 featured 'amazing weather, low 50s to start, mid 70s in afternoon' but rain dumped 2.5 inches the day before, forcing course changes."
      },
      "altitude": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Starting from Sheridan at ~3,800 feet and climbing toward the Bighorn Mountain foothills, Jeffrey's 100-mile reached 6,516 feet maximum elevation. Sea-level riders will notice the thinner air but won't need oxygen therapy. High enough to affect performance, manageable enough to keep racing."
      },
      "adventure": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "The course turns 'north onto the gravel nestled along the base of the Bighorn Mountains' with minimal dust conditions, possibly from road oil treatment or recent rain. One rider loved starting 'at Kendrick Park, right there in the heart of town' with horses 'grazing on the hillside overlooking the park.' Wyoming backcountry through terrain most never see."
      },
      "prestige": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Jeffrey finished 64th out of 65 finishers in the 100-mile, spending most of the race dead last with a sweeper truck following him. Heidi notes the mass start crowd was 'mostly filled with people that have never road raced or ridden in a peloton.' Self-proclaimed 'Premier Gravel Race of the West' without competitive depth to support the claim."
      },
      "race_quality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Aid stations every 10-12 miles offer pickle juice shots, bacon, and PBR with volunteers providing 'cheers and cowbells and offers to feed me' according to Jeffrey. Course changes happen when weather demands it - the single-track mountain section was eliminated in 2022 due to snow. Functional organization with weather flexibility."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Heidi finished prouder than she'd 'been in a long time, or even never' after her second-place women's finish. The finish line features 'cheering crowds, a band in the amphitheater, and the smell of delicious barbecue' with free race beer. Solid Wyoming gravel touring without standout memorable moments."
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "The event 'has crazy huge women's fields' per Heidi, with 330+ riders in just the 40-mile distance. Aid station volunteers 'got all whoop-y and jumpy' when they realized Jeffrey was attempting the full 100-mile. Organizers ban course support vehicles 'for rider safety, and to minimize dust' creating a more controlled racing environment."
      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Jeffrey rode 'almost all of the hundred miles solo' and was 'In. Fact. DFL' by mile 20, finishing 64th of 65 riders with a sweeper truck escort. While field sizes reach 330+ in shorter distances, competitive depth remains shallow. Large participation numbers don't translate to racing quality at the sharp end."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "$100 entry includes Dead Swede t-shirt, sticker, and pint glass with well-stocked aid stations every 10-12 miles featuring bacon and beer. Free finish line barbecue, live band, and race beer complete the package. Solid bang for buck accessing Bighorn Mountain foothills terrain that would cost serious gas money to explore solo."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Sheridan, Wyoming keeps lodging and dining costs reasonable, though day-before packet pickup 'pretty much requires' overnight accommodation. The $100 entry fee won't strain anyone's budget. Equipment needs stay modest - Heidi succeeded on a 2012 cyclocross bike with narrow tires, proving expensive gravel setups aren't required."
