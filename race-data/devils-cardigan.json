Elite winner Brendan Johnston needed 3:24:12 to complete the course, while women's winner Talia Appleton required 4:03:15. Scott Mattern created his own \"150km XL Cardigan\" by combining both distance options, noting \"Most of the ride is now lost in a blur of bar-chewing climbs and bone-rattling descents.\" Longer than Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

Similar technical demands to Gravel Worlds."

The elite men's field hit threshold territory for the first 15 minutes on Mutual Valley alone. A final kicker within 10km punishes riders when legs are already destroyed. More climbing than SBT GRVL at the same score."

        "explanation": "Historical weather data shows average highs of 42°F and lows of 34°F, with a 65% chance of rain on any given day, and gusts reaching 28 mph. Tasmania's winter conditions create annual weather roulette. \"Year one had near-freezing conditions with bouts of rain and sleet-like scuds. Year two served up near gale-force winds.\" The 2023 race featured torrential rain that \"muddied the course\" significantly. Scott Mattern warns that \"layers against wind rain and cold are a must on each and every trip.\" More weather exposure than Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."
      },

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Derby sits at modest Tasmanian elevations without serious altitude effects, though pre-race chatter included concerns about \"snow above 800m.\" The 2,300m of total climbing comes through sustained elevation changes rather than high-altitude challenges. Maximum elevations remain within Tasmania's moderate mountain ranges where weather exposure matters more than thin air. Modest altitude compared to Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."
      },
      "adventure": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Scott Mattern's single-track section became \"one steady trickling creek\" after heavy rain, forcing riders to navigate what should have been highlights as \"challenging and gritty grind.\" His night riding through fog left him with lights that \"refracted by the fog, and hindered rather than helped my visibility.\" The 87% gravel course through remote Tasmanian wilderness delivers isolation where mechanical failures have consequences."
      },
      "prestige": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Derby, Tasmania isn't the center of the gravel universe, and the UCI Gravel World Series inclusion in 2025 feels more like a participation trophy than earned status. Sure, it hosted AusCycling Gravel Nationals in 2023 and 2024, but that's like being the tallest kid in elementary school. The race website mentions 'the gravel scene taking on the world' - cute aspirational marketing, but prestige comes from decades of breaking spirits, not press releases."

Brendan Johnston's winning attack on Ralph Falls Climb \"approximately 35km into the race\" demonstrated tactical racing opportunities. Course photography by Kristina Vackova and Beardy McBeard adds professional documentation, though basic logistical information gaps remain."

Remote Tasmanian location naturally limits international participation despite UCI status. Elite talent like Tiffany Cromwell and race-winning performances show quality depth within the Australian gravel scene, but global representation remains constrained by geography. Less competitive depth than Almanzo 100."

        "score": 1,

Derby, Tasmania - you're looking at international flights, domestic connections, rental car, and accommodation in a tourist area that knows you're trapped. The website mentions accommodation partners but provides zero actual details or pricing, which usually means expensive and limited. Getting gear there and back adds another layer of logistical cost most riders don't calculate until too late. More expensive than Atlas Mountain Race."

          "transcript": "My name's Alex. I'm from\nTasmania and I'm like to ride my bike\nand pretty much anything that involves\n[Music]\npedaling. Started riding mountain bikes\nas a kid.\num and was lucky enough to get selected\nto represent Australia a couple times as\na junior and under 23 and then won the\nunder 23 national title in 2018 and then\nonce gravel riding kind of came on the\nscene got pretty into that. Um and then\nyeah went to the world championships in\n2023 for\ngravel from Arthur's river to to war. It\nwas good contrast. So there's two\nsections the western explorer and then\nwent into the snake pit from\nwarar pretty much to deline a mix of\nfire road to yeah bin long bay it's\nalways on pretty nice rubber road and\nthen once you get to ranking pretty much\nmy trails all the way to being long\nuh do a lot of indoor training\nthroughout the week and then try to get\na longer ride to over the weekend. Um\nhaving just gone over to Europe, done a\nfew longer rides just to bike.\nCastened by pebble to the shore of\neternity to be washed by the ocean of\ntime. He has shape, form, and substance.\nIt is\nme. One day I will be no more. But high\npebble will remain here on the shore of\neternity. Mute witness for the als that\ntoday I came and stood at the edge of\nthe\nworld.\nPretty much the inspiration for this\nride was PAC's ride. Um,\nin 2021, there wasn't much racing going\non, so I chose to do a challenge in\nDerby and go ride every mountain bike\ntrail in one day, which was cool. I\nthink Pac may have done something\nsimilar in the past. So then when he\ncame to Tazzy and did the crossing, it\nwas Yeah. got to do that. That's pretty\ncool. Heat up\nhere.\nand then went into the snake pit and\nthat was Yeah, there's lots of trees and\nstuff over and really wet. It's like a\nriver bed with soft gravel, soft mud and\nyeah, water and bike. Pretty much got\nstuck to these. Yeah, it's fun but hard\nand slow. Um and then yeah pop po that\nstraight into war and got to\nrefill. Yeah. Yeah.\nFrom\nWarar pretty much to Delerain with a mix\nof fire road and into some pretty\ngnarly like rough terrain.\nsome walking. Probably wouldn't even do\nit on a mountain bike. It's pretty\npretty tough. Lots of steep climbs.\n[Applause]\nand then yeah that's when it started\ngetting dark as well. So the section\njust before\nDelerain, it got dark. Didn't really\nknow what I was in for. The climbs felt\nlonger. Like when it's dark, you don't\nknow where the top is. Can't see the\ntop. So makes it harder. And then\nthere's a couple of river crossings. And\nthen yeah, finally got to Delerain\nrefill.\nGet a hit.\nYeah, you definitely feel like you're\nout there by yourself and there's no one\nelse around. Just you and couple hours\nand that interesting feeling. So, in the\nsnake pit, my first axis battery went\nflat,\nwhich I thought, it's odd. It's only\nbeen 7 hours, so shouldn't go\nflat. So, I took three. So, put my last\none in. And then that only lasted 4\nhours. Got to bless and it was pretty\ndead.\nBut\nthen, yeah, pretty much early that\nmorning, so probably 4:00 a.m. or\nsomething, the weather changed. This got\ngot really\ncold, started\nraining when I was in the\ncar thinking I'll just get warm and then\nwe'll be able to go again.\nUm and then yes kind of made the\ncall.\nYeah. I\nthink yeah it's the\nconditions about 100%. No Yeah.\nYeah.\nShould we keep you warm? Well done, man.\nYes. It's good. Yeah, that's\namazing.\nYeah. Yeah. Well done. Very proud of\nyou. It's\nThere's no other way. That was\nfun.\nAnd finally, like is the option of doing\nit all again still out there, still\nthinking about it?\nYeah, definitely. It kind of leaves you\nwith some unfinished\nbusiness.\nUm, but also, yeah, it leaves you\nwanting more. So yeah, definitely I\nthink potential for another attempt\nmaybe with yeah more daylight and better\nweather, better time of\nyear.\nLet's go. Let's\ngo. Oh, get it. Get it.",

The course runs from Arthur's river to Warar, with particularly gnarly rough terrain from Warar to Delerain that requires walking and features steep climbs so difficult riders say they wouldn't attempt them on mountain bikes. Weather conditions can change dramatically, with temperatures dropping and rain starting around 4 a.m. Equipment reliability is crucial as bike lights can fail unexpectedly. The course was reportedly much harder than previous years. Despite the brutal conditions, riders emphasize the strong community spirit and camaraderie, with fellow competitors providing encouragement during difficult climbs. The race leaves participants feeling isolated in remote wilderness sections but also creates lasting bonds through shared suffering."
