The 7:00 am start from 4250 N 3500 W gets riders moving, but specific packet pickup and parking details remain unclear."

The official 55-mile listing conflicts with rider reports of 32-mile Dino-Lite, 60-mile Dino-Bite, and 100+ mile options. Distance clarity matters when altitude is already crushing people. More compact than Grinduro."

Less technical than The Mid South."

Dawn Manfredonia tackled Dino-Mite's \"9,400 ft of vertical gain\" over 106 miles before switching courses. The climbing is front-loaded and relentless, but the published 3,500 feet significantly understates what riders actually face. Less climbing than The Mid South."

DNA Cycling Crew reported \"temperatures were perfect\" with cooling as elevation increased, but Cassie Cobb battled \"headwinds\" that made \"the last few miles a slow grind.\" June in the High Uinta Mountains delivers variable conditions—from perfect climbing weather to punishing wind exposure on descents back to the valley finish. More weather exposure than Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

Starting around 5,200 feet in Vernal, the altitude gain becomes a race-defining factor rather than a minor consideration. Modest altitude compared to Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

        "explanation": "Three years in and still bouncing between course distances like an amateur operation finding its identity. Landing USA Cycling Junior Gravel National Series Stop 5 status provides some legitimacy, but the persistent confusion over basic race details and dinosaur pun marketing (\"Jurass-kicked,\" \"Mega-Saur-Ass\") keeps this firmly in regional novelty territory rather than must-do gravel status."

But basic course data remains chaotic—official sources can't agree whether it's 55 or 60 miles, with riders reporting everything from 32 to 106 miles. When Dawn Manfredonia can switch courses mid-race due to poor planning, organization still has work to do."

The landscape delivers, even when logistics don't."

Fast people don't race in information vacuums. Thinner field than Ouray Gravel Grinder."

        "explanation": "Bergensbanen emphasized it \"wasn't over-commercialized\" with family organizers present, while SooperDew got \"Ironman-level support\" in a grassroots setting. The High Uinta Mountain access alone costs serious money elsewhere, plus Vernal's full adventure weekend infrastructure. Multiple riders immediately committed to returning—the strongest value indicator for any gravel race."

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Registration runs $50-75. Vernal sits 200 miles from Salt Lake City in eastern Utah's nowhere, requiring significant travel commitment from anywhere populated. The town offers \"plenty of hotels\" and camping per race promotion, suggesting reasonable local costs once you arrive. But getting to this High Uinta Mountain access point means either a long drive through Utah's empty middle or flying into SLC and adding hours of additional travel. Higher total cost than Badlands."
