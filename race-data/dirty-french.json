        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "9,000+ feet of climbing in 100 miles is exceptional for the Midwest. Relentless punchy climbs through Appalachian foothills create leg-destroying accumulated vertical. More climbing than SBT GRVL at the same score."

        "explanation": "Historical weather data shows average highs of 73°F and lows of 54°F, with a 52% chance of rain on any given day. Ohio spring weather is a dice roll - temps in the 50s-70s with real potential for rain and mud. Not extreme but variable conditions keep riders guessing. Similar climate challenges to SBT GRVL."

This isn't manicured gravel—it's crushed limestone that turns to peanut butter when wet, farm roads that pitch up without warning, and long stretches where your GPS becomes your only friend. The Chillicothe region doesn't negotiate; it just keeps rolling upward until your legs forget what flat feels like.",
