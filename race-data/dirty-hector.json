Small town location limits lodging and food options, requiring more planning than destination events."

      "elevation": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "3,700 feet over 40 miles delivers serious climbing punishment in Finger Lakes National Forest terrain. The elevation gain contributes heavily to the wide time gaps, with winners maintaining 17.5 mph while the field gets progressively dropped on the sustained climbs throughout the course."

      "climate": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Late May race dealt with 'weeks of wet weather leading up to the start' in 2025, which is typical spring conditions. Course warnings include 'may be MUDDY' as standard expectation. Finger Lakes weather in May remains unpredictable for outdoor events."

        "explanation": "Course takes riders through creeks, forests, and requires fence crossings in cow fields.

However, it's marked racing rather than exploratory gravel adventure that creates lasting memories beyond the finish."

Strong word-of-mouth with sources recommending asking 'anyone who raced last year' about the experience."

      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Post-race features Babe's Burgers food truck, beer, and ice cream at Silver Queen Farm. Multiple sources call it 'totally worth it' despite challenging conditions. 2025 called 'a great success' even with weeks of pre-race wet weather affecting course conditions."

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "131 finishers in 2025 with competitive front end - top three separated by under two minutes. Ruth Sherman's age 66 victory in Open Women shows depth across age groups. Regional event drawing sponsored teams but not national-level depth of major destination races."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "State championship racing through unique mixed terrain with proper post-race amenities including food truck and beer.

      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
