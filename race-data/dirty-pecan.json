Dave chose the 80-mile option knowing he'd be dropped by the century group, finding it 'perfectly fine.' Similar distance to Crusher in the Tushar.

Dave found the 2025 route was 'mostly packed sand' with occasional 'random red mud spots.' Less technical than The Mid South.

One rider nearly bonked on 'one particularly long hill' with five miles to go in the 150-mile route. Dave's 2025 ride included 'scores of hills' in the final paved miles, but nothing approaching serious elevation. Flatter profile than Croatan Buck Fifty."

March conditions started 'chilly but beautiful' at 42 degrees in 2025, warming significantly by ride's end to 'good hard and hot' temperatures. The early-season timing provides ideal weather before Florida heat becomes oppressive, though riders face full sun between oak canopy sections. Similar climate challenges to SBT GRVL."

        "score": 1,

The unique red clay terrain through pecan orchards offers scenery unavailable elsewhere, though the unsupported format with no course marking adds navigation challenges."

        "explanation": "The charity ride format supporting 4-H programs has raised nearly $200,000 over 10 years, doubling attendance to 400+ riders.

Higher total cost than Badlands."

The terrain varies from hard-packed clay roads to gravel with challenging sandy sections, particularly at Gum Swamp Road 15 miles from the finish, which riders describe as completely blowing up groups. The route features rolling hills through beautiful tree-lined Kennedy roads and pecan orchards. Sandy spots cause significant problems for riders on 40mm tires or less. The race starts early for longer distances, with 150-mile riders beginning at 7am in 40-degree weather. A critical decision point at mile 75 determines whether riders continue for 38 additional miles on the 150-mile route or take the easier 100-mile option. The event draws 480+ riders on various bikes including mountain bikes and fat bikes, with proceeds benefiting local 4-H programs. Camping is available with separate RV and tent areas."
