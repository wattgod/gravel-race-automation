Registration costs just $25 with free parking and port-o-lets at the UF extension service start area. However, riders need 40mm+ tires despite website claims that 'skilled riders would do fine on 28 or 30 tires,' as K-Dogg's team discovered."
      },
      "length": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Multiple distance options from 40 to 200 miles let riders match ambition to fitness. K-Dogg warned his group early: 'I'm pretty sure this pace isn't sustainable for another 140 miles' after just 10 miles on the 150-mile route. Dave chose the 80-mile option knowing he'd be dropped by the century group, finding it 'perfectly fine.'"
      },
      "technicality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Red clay roads become 'sticky and criss crossed by washouts' when conditions deteriorate. K-Dogg described 12 miles of 'slippery, dead flat wet sand' where 'every stroke was an effort' and drafting was 'virtually useless.' Dave found the 2025 route was 'mostly packed sand' with occasional 'random red mud spots.'"
      },
      "elevation": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "North Florida's rolling terrain offers minimal climbing despite K-Dogg noting 'hills got longer and steeper' on red clay. One rider nearly bonked on 'one particularly long hill' with five miles to go in the 150-mile route. Dave's 2025 ride included 'scores of hills' in the final paved miles, but nothing approaching serious elevation."
      },
      "climate": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "March conditions started 'chilly but beautiful' at 42 degrees in 2025, warming significantly by ride's end to 'good hard and hot' temperatures. The early-season timing provides ideal weather before Florida heat becomes oppressive, though riders face full sun between oak canopy sections."
      },
      "altitude": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Monticello, Florida sits in low-elevation North Florida with no altitude considerations whatsoever. Sea-level riding means no acclimatization needs or breathing challenges for any rider category."
      },
      "adventure": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "K-Dogg described 'mile after mile rolling up and down rusty red clay hills through countless bucolic mossy oak tunnels' with 'so much openness and so few people.' The unique red clay terrain through pecan orchards offers scenery unavailable elsewhere, though the unsupported format with no course marking adds navigation challenges."
      },
      "prestige": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "The charity ride format supporting 4-H programs has raised nearly $200,000 over 10 years, doubling attendance to 400+ riders. However, the explicitly unsupported nature and $25 entry fee position this as a community fundraiser rather than a competitive event drawing serious racing talent."
      },
      "race_quality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "The completely unsupported format means 'YOU are 100% responsible for YOU, YOUR welfare, YOUR equipment, YOUR navigation, and YOUR own food and drink.' No course marking, aid stations, or support vehicles create a self-sufficient adventure rather than organized race infrastructure."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Riders traverse Jefferson County, the 'Pecan Capital of the World,' through historic farmsteads so quiet 'you could hear a cotton boll drop.' K-Dogg noted breaking into 'green meadows and gorgeous historic farmsteads' with 'virtually no traffic' through the mossy oak tunnels."
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Co-founder Betsy Barfield has built something drawing riders like Randy Honcik from North Carolina who appreciate 'the energy of the group' and 'beautiful pecan farms.' The Blackwater Gravel Grinders exemplify the welcoming atmosphere, inviting Dave for post-ride dinner and camping with 'theraguns, air legs, talk of the day's ride.'"
      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "The charity ride attracts adventure-seekers rather than competitive fields, with riders explicitly told 'if you need a juice box and a hug every 20 miles, this is not the ride for you.' A crusty older rider's comment 'Goddamn cross bikes! I thought I could hold you guys off!' captures the casual racing spirit."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "At $25 registration, all proceeds support 4-H overnight camps developing 'important leadership skills' in local kids. The 2025 event alone donated nearly $30,000, with the 10-year total approaching $200,000. Multiple distance options and free parking maximize accessibility for the charitable cause."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "The $25 registration fee is exceptionally low, but Monticello's limited lodging options create accommodation challenges. Riders need specialized equipment including 40mm+ tires and navigation devices for the unmarked, unsupported routes. The UF extension service venue provides free parking and basic facilities."
