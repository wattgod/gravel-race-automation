The remote Kielder Forest location requires driving, with limited local accommodation forcing most riders to camp or commute 30+ miles from Hexham."
      },
      "length": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Rob Weaver learned that \"covering that distance when you're rattling over rocks, grit, gravel and mud takes more energy\" than expected, requiring a mountain bike approach to pacing. The 130-mile distance delivers serious hurt-locker territory with 8+ hours of riding, long enough to separate pretenders but achievable for fit riders who pace intelligently through Kielder's relentless terrain."
      },
      "technicality": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "The course runs \"95% on gravel\" through varied Kielder Forest surfaces that one rider described as ranging \"from smooth gravel, to very loose rocks (often on corners), to big rough arm-pumping rocky descents.\" While not single-track technical, the mix of embedded rocks and slippery conditions demands real gravel skills, especially when rain creates \"a slick, thin mud\" coating the forest tracks."
      },
      "elevation": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Over 14,000 feet of climbing across 130 miles means relentless grinding through Kielder's undulating forest terrain. The course rarely offers flat recovery sections, with continuous ascents and descents that rattle riders over rough surfaces. David Arthur noted the \"demanding and challenging\" nature of the climbs, which provide enough vertical to crack legs and expose fitness gaps throughout the field."
      },
      "climate": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Rob Weaver experienced typical April conditions: \"At about the halfway point, around 2 hours 30 minutes in, the wind got up and it rained quite heavily.\" Northumberland's unpredictable spring weather can shift from dust clouds to heavy rain mid-race, with temperatures that require layering strategies. Riders face everything from mud to potential snow in this changeable climate."

      "altitude": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Kielder Forest sits near sea level in Northumberland - altitude is completely irrelevant here. The highest points barely register in any meaningful way for physiological impact. Save altitude concerns for races that actually climb into thin air territory."

      "adventure": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Nearly 100% off-road through Britain's largest forest creates isolation where self-reliance matters. Jenny Tough noted the April timing as riders \"crawl out of their winter reverie\" for their first major test. The remote Kielder setting, unpredictable weather, and mandatory survival kit requirements create adventure elements where equipment choices and pacing decisions have real consequences."

Called \"the UK's answer to Unbound\" by cycling media, it defines the British gravel scene. The mass start energy and sheer scale make it the bucket-list event for UK gravel riders, establishing it as the premier challenge in Britain."

        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "David Arthur praised the \"excellent\" organization with \"food stops among the best I've ever seen.\" The event provides proper GPS tracking, mandatory kit requirements for safety, and well-stocked feed zones. The mass start can create jostling early on, but the non-competitive format (finishers listed alphabetically) emphasizes personal challenge over racing with solid safety protocols."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 5,
        "explanation": "Epic forest riding through Britain's most remote areas delivers memorable suffering that defines the UK gravel experience. One rider marveled at how \"a new pale-grey colourway had apparently permeated every crease, fold and machined surface\" from the mud coating. The combination of Kielder's isolation, unpredictable weather, and long hours creates lasting memories for both right and wrong reasons."

        "explanation": "The heart of UK gravel culture with passionate local participation and a \"Gravel Expo\" at Kielder Castle featuring top industry brands.

        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Elite riders like Josh Ibbett mixing with competitive athletes like Rob Weaver and Jenny Tough shows serious talent throughout the field. The 2,000-rider cap draws the UK's strongest gravel racers alongside enthusiastic challengers, creating depth without major pro presence. Fast UK amateurs and semi-pros lead the field rather than WorldTour-level talent, but the quality remains high."

        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "£85 (~$105) for a well-supported 130km event with three feed stations, GPS tracking, and mandatory kit requirements is reasonable for UK standards. The Strada Gravel Ultra Plus wheels and proper equipment setups riders describe show the event attracts serious participants willing to invest in quality gear, making the entry fee competitive with similar UK sportives."

      "expenses": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Registration around £85-100 plus UK travel costs to remote Kielder Forest, requiring either camping or 30+ mile commutes to proper lodging in Hexham. Equipment setups like Josh Ibbett's 35mm Schwalbe G-One tires or Bruce Dalton's Clement X'Plor MSO 36mm tubeless show riders invest in quality gear.

          "transcript": "I'm 150 km into a 200 km gravel\nepic. My legs are screaming. My lungs\nare screaming. But I'm in the front of\nthe\nrace. If I can stick this out to the\nend, this is going to be incredible.\n[Music]\nHaving finished my first pro gravel\nrace, the Siata Classic, just a few\nweeks ago, my prep for Unbound continues\non and I'm back for more action. This\ntime much, much, much closer to home up\nhere at the Kilda Forest, which is right\non the England Scotland border for one\nof the biggest and best gravel events in\nthe UK, Dirty Rever.\n[Applause]\nNow, in my eyes, this is one of the\ncoolest events and could potentially\nrival some of the big US events. And\nwe've got three different routes to\nchoose from. Naturally, I've gone for\nthe longest route, of course, the 200 km\nversion, but there's also 130k and a 65k\nroute to choose from, which would be\nmuch more friendly on your legs. Now,\nwhile myself and lots of other people\nare going to be pushing our bikes and\nbodies to the absolute limit to get a\nspeedy time, there are also loads of\npeople that are going to be focusing on\nfinishing with a smile rather than a\ngrimace on their face. And that for me\nis one of the greatest things about\ngravel racing. Now, it's not until the\nrace starts, but a few days ago, I was\nunsure if I would even make it to the\nstart line.\nSo, what makes me doubtful about things,\nI hear you ask. Well, this is the bike\nthat I plan to race on. Now, I don't\nthink you need to be a bike expert to\nunderstand where the problem lies. Now,\nin a few days time, I'm going to have to\nbe racing on this thing, and I'm going\nto build it in the meantime as well. The\nproblem though is completely\nself-inflicted because of my desire to\nbuild my own gravel race bike.\nThankfully though, I've got support from\none of the best in the business and the\ncreators of the world's first gravel\nspecific group set. Yep, that's right.\nShimano have come on board to sponsor\nthis video and help me get to the start\nline at Unbound for race day, which also\nmeans I had the very envious task of a\nfew weeks ago selecting all of the\nindividual components that I want to use\nto build this bike, plus a few top\nsecret goodies I can use for extra speed\ncome race day unbound. So, let me show\nyou the parts I've chosen.\nSo, this is the GRX 8250 12speed DI2\ngroup set plus a set of GRX gravel\nspecific wheels. And these are the\ncomponents that I am about to build this\nbike with. So, time is ticking. It's not\nthat long till race day. Let's get this\nthing built.\nYou got to think about\nWell, thankfully that all went to plan.\nAnd here we are the day before the\nevent. My mindset and body are in good\nshape. The spirit of gravel vibes have\nbeen turned up to the max. And as you\ncan see, I've built myself an absolutely\nboss looking gravel race bike.\nNow, this is also an event that I'm\ngoing to be using to test out not only\nmy bike setup, but also lots of the\nother equipment that I plan to use come\nrace day at Unbound. So, complementing\nthis particularly bright bike, I also\nhave a particularly stealthy Rule 28\ngravel aerosuit, which I'm also going to\nbe using with a 3 L Camelback hydration\nbladder to keep dehydration at bay. Now\ngranted, here in the UK, hydration might\nnot be top of the priority list, but I\nthink it's important to practice what I\npreach. And I've also made some tweaks\nand refinement to my fueling, too. With\nrace day coming up tomorrow and 200 km\nand 3,500 m worth of\nelevation, right now, probably best if I\nget an early night and put my feet up\nand see you guys in the morning.\nTell\nme. Let's go, guys.\nSpicy.\nOkay, the front\ngroup. There it is. Spicy start.\nThere's one 2 3 4 5 6 seven people\nincluding\nme. Let's go.\nAnd I do want to point out, as the\norganized say, technically it's not a\nrace. It is a timed event. But let me\njust tell you the guys at the front they\nwere racing. So first bit of rolls out\nneutralized in inverted commas and then\nwe were straight onto the rough stuff\nand it was actually pretty hilly early\non. I mean this whole event is pretty\nhilly. 200 km 3,500 m of elevation.\nYou're going up and downhill all day\nlong which for someone my size is\nperhaps not the greatest thing in the\nworld.\nNonetheless, the race started actually\npretty good. Made it to the front, great\nsuccess. I stayed at the front and then\na few of the guys absolutely dropped the\nhammer real early on which essentially\nwithin the first 15 to 20 minutes formed\na group that\nwas seven seven or eight riders. We\nfound that was a group that worked\nreally well, especially on some of the\nflatter sections. We could ride through\nand off together and that was actually\nreally good.\nOkay, let's head down now. Everyone's in\nthe zone.\nThe climbs are pretty\nrelentless. There's another one.\nOh boy. I tell you what, I love riding\nmy bike. I love riding it\nfast. These guys are not messing around.\nOne thing I tried to be aware of knowing\nhow long this event is and how tough the\nclimbing was going to be was to make\nsure every time we went up the hills I\nwas doing my absolute best to really\nreally spin rather than put some extra\nstrain on my legs. And as I said\nyesterday, having that 312 chain ring\nwas absolutely delightful. I've got to\nsay that. So, I think that actually did\nhelp me out quite a bit with trying to\nlook after my legs and conserve my\nenergy. As we get into the depths of the\nrace, the group was still riding well\ntogether, but it started to split apart.\nNot because anyone was trying to attack\nor ride particularly hard, but just\npurely down to the demanding terrain. We\nstarted to get halfway through and\nyou've got some pretty long climbs.\nWe're talking 15 minutes of steady,\ngradual uphill with rough, loose\nsurfaces and some real kicks and spikes\nin the grading which really made the\nlegs hurt. So all of a sudden those\nclimbs whittleled our group down to say\nseven or eight riders down to a six.\nThen it went down to a four and then it\nwent down to a three and would you\nbelieve it? I was in the front of three.\nI did have to do a small little reality\ncheck and I was like hold on I appear to\nbe at the front of the race. This\ndoesn't tend to happen in many GCN\nvideos. So, that was actually really\ncool. And I'm I'm pleased that we can\nshow sometimes we can do all\nright. The breakaway\ncompatriots are 400 watts again.\nHi, it's me again. As promised, I'm back\nto tell you more about my setup. Now, at\nthe core of this bike, it's the Gravel\nFrame set, drawing on the DNA of\nPinerelloo's performance road bikes, but\nbringing that across to the gravel. Now,\nyou've already seen the components I've\nchosen. I want to tell you a bit more\nabout why I've made these decisions.\nFirstly, I've gone two bike. And the\nreason for this is simply the sheer\nspeeds that you encounter in gravel\nracing these days. And I prefer to have\nthat larger chain ring up front to help\ndeal with those speeds. And I just\nprefer the feeling of it. Now, in this\ncase, it's a 48 to chain ring. And\nthat's typically what you find on a two\nby setup compared to the smaller chain\nrings that you might find on a one by\nsetup. On certain bikes, running two by\ncan really limit your tire clearance.\nBut here, I can still run a 50 mm tire\nand a front derailure. Plus, with the\namount of climbing that I'm doing, this\nsmaller 31 to chain ring will be a real\ndelight. Gearing is a big subject of\ndiscussion on gravel, perhaps more so\nthan tire choice. At the back here, I've\ngone for an 11 to 34 to cassette.\nessentially the same gear ratios as what\nI use on almost all of my road bikes.\nNow, this rear derailer can actually\nhandle a bigger cassette than this, up\nto about a 36, I believe. But the reason\nI've chosen this is because I feel it\nstrikes the perfect balance between\ngiving you a broad range of gears, but\nalso having the ratios close enough\nbetween the gears for smaller jumps.\nNow, if you were going to be spending\nmore time climbing, then it's nice to\nknow that you have got the option on\nthis GRX rear derailer to go up to a 36\nto give you that easiest climbing gear.\nNow, I know many GCN Tech Super fans\nwill perhaps be ever so slightly\ndisappointed that I haven't fitted a\nspare Jura Ace chain set to this bike,\nbut fear not. In order to keep this\ninside joke running, you'll be pleased\nto know that I have fitted a Dura Ace\ncassette, a Dura Ace chain, and Dura Ace\nbrake rotors. I've also adjusted these\nlevers in as far as possible, as I do\nwith all Shimano levers. Now, the reason\nI've done that is because, fun fact, for\nmy height, I actually have particularly\nsmallsized\nhands. Okay, moving swiftly on, let's\ntalk about wheels. Now, these bad boys\nhave a 32 mm height rim with a 25 mm\ninternal rim width, which by road bike\nstandards might not seem particularly\ncommon, but here on the gravel bike,\nwhen you're running these big chunky\ntires, well, it all works perfectly\ntogether. The wide rim works nicely with\nthese big chunky 50 mm Pirelli tires.\nAnd the 32 mm height rim depth helps\nwith aerodynamics. Although granted, at\nthe speeds myself and most people ride\noff gravel, aerodynamics probably\nneedn't be your main concern. Now, these\ntires are actually the speediest gravel\ntires in Pirelli's range. And because of\ntheir extra-l large volume, I'm actually\nrunning them at some pretty low\npressures. Just 20 PSI in the rear and\n18 PSI in the front. This is going to be\ndreamy over the rough stuff. And then\nfinally, I've got all my spares stashed\nin my saddle pack back here. I've got\nthe same cell San Marco 3D printed\nsaddle which I used at the seat race\nkeeping me comfy. And then up front I've\nactually got the brand new Wahoo Rome\nhelping to keep me on track for the\nrace. Nice. Right, let's get back to the\naction. See\nyou. 76k done. 2 hours\n30. That's quick for the road.\nOkay, this is a pivotal\nmoment. I didn't stop at the\nfeed. We're going to hack it out. Stick\nit out to the next one. I'm in third\nplace. Top three. Come on. As I said, my\nplan was to fuel and hydrate correctly,\nget everything dialed in, and then I was\ngoing to stop at the 100 km marker.\nHowever, the red mist may have\ndescended. And when I got to the 100 km\nmarker, because I was at the front of\nthe race with the two other guys,\nneither of them stopped at the feed, and\nI made a split second, I was like at the\ncrossroads, the race went left, the feed\nwas to the right, and I went I turned\nright and then was like, \"Nope, I can't\ndo it. I can't stop.\" So, I did a\nU-turn, joined back at the front of the\nrace because in my head, I thought, how\noften are you going to be at the front\nof the race? I don't want to just give\nthat up. I knew I had enough water with\nme. I had hydro tabs in that. I knew I\nhad enough gel because I had four big\nprecision 90 gels in my pocket. And one\nof my water bottles was full up with\ngel, which is like just over 300 g of\ncarbohydrates. So, I knew I was good to\ngo for a further distance. And then in\nmy head I was like, \"Right, I'm going to\nstop at 150k feed zone because I think\nI've got enough fuel to get me to\nthere.\" So that was my game plan. How it\nturned out was we got\nabout 120 km into the race and we got to\nthe biggest climb of the entire route.\nAnd let me just tell you this, the guys\nrode up there so booming hard. I was\nsanding the wheels and some of the\nspikes were doing like 400 watts. When\nthe gradient backs off, we're doing like\nwatts. And when you are over 100 km deep\ninto a rough, hilly gravel race, Yeah.\nstarts to bite.\ndrops for the front group.\nAh, I just can't keep up this pace on\nthe climbs riding with the guys at the\nfront. Like, hats off to them cuz they\nwere absolutely motoring and I was just\nessentially doing my best to keep up\nwith them. the two Ribble Collective\nriders who incidentally were actually\nout at Sea Otter. Jensen Young being one\nof them who finished pretty high up the\nresults at Seaotter. Once these guys\ncarried on dropping the hammer, it\nliterally tore my legs to pieces and two\na combination of two things. One, I kind\nof got dropped. Two, I also thought, do\nyou know what? There's 80 or so\nkilometers left to go. If I try to carry\nand maintain this\npace, I think there's a good chance\nwe're going to be back at the sea otter\nsituation where I explode and grind to\nan absolute\nhalt. Now then, you will have noticed a\nlot of the footage from Dirty Reba was\nfilmed by me and let me show you exactly\nhow I've done it. So, here on the front\nof my bike, I've got the Insta 360 Ace\nPro 2. Not only does it enable me to\nshoot in beautiful 8K, hugely stabilized\nto get that silky smooth footage, but\nalso it means using the magnetic quick\nrelease adapter on the front of my bike,\nI can quickly and easily do\nthis, take the camera\noff, then I can hold it like this and\ntalk to you guys pretty easily. Then\nonce I finished, I can clip it back onto\nthe front of the\nbike and away we go again.\nYeah. Yeah. Yeah,\nas I was coming down towards the\napproach to the final feed zone at 155\nkm, I believe it was, there was another\nbig long climb. And at this\nstage was where it felt like things were\nstarting to come undone a little bit. My\nlegs was tired, my legs were cramping\nup. I was starting to feel panicked and\nstressed because I knew I was going slow\nand there was still a long way to go.\nBut I tried to sit tight because\nactually last week as we were in GC Mega\nBase, I sat and had a chat Vol. He was\nlike, \"You know what? I've done loads of\nthese big ultra endurance events and he\nwas like, you are going to feel really\nbad and crap at some stage, but sit\ntight. If you eat and drink enough,\neventually your body will come good.\" So\nthat's what I tried to do and it wasn't\nhappening that quickly. So, I stopped at\nthe the last feed zone because I\nbasically run out of water and run out\nof food. Much to my disgust as I\nstopped, filled my bottles up, and got\nsome food. The guy who was in fourth\nplace behind me caught and passed me cuz\nhe didn't stop. So, that was me my\nplacing gone there. But the main issue I\nhad was I was fast on the descent and\ncould catch him up. But I was so slow\ngoing up the climbs that I just went\nfurther and further backwards. Third\nplace vanished, fourth place vanished,\nfifth place vanished, and then before I\nknew it, I had about 40 km to go, 30 km\nto go. And I was back in sixth place\nfeeling pretty sorry for myself. My legs\nwere no good. My head was starting to\ndrop. And if I'm\nhonest, not only was I going through a\nbad patch physically, but also mentally.\nI was like, if I'm honest, I felt like I\nwanted to give up. I was like, this is\nall going wrong. I'm having flashbacks\nof sea. But I sat tight.\nOne rider who caught me as a hope\nfactory racing rider, someone called Rob\nJeb, who I know from racing in my\ncyclcross days and going to the World\nChampionships representing Great Britain\nwhen I was 17 and he was a senior. So,\nit was actually like a real cool moment\nto meet back up in this gravel race\nagain and he was like, \"Hey, how's it\ngoing?\" Tuck in behind. And thanks to\nRob, he basically saved me. I could tuck\nin his wheel and he set a real good\ntempo and we started to make good\nprogress. The legs came back\nround. I need to catch this guy. I\nreally want third place. Ah. Oh yeah.\nEverything is\nhurting. I've had my final refuel. My\nonly hope is that this guy seems a bit\nslow on the descents, but quick on the\nclimbs. And that's why I'm\nslow. Come on now. Come on, Alex. I was\ngoing through some pretty dark times\nactually because I was trying to sit\ntight and think my legs are going to\ncome good and eventually it wasn't\nreally happening. Then we went into this\nabsolutely beautiful smooth winding\ngravel path that ran next to the\nreservoir or the lake. And I tell you\nwhat, some of the views were absolutely\nincredible. And the way that it all\ncurved and swooped around, that was a\nreal delight at the end. All of a\nsudden, I glanced up and I was like,\n\"Hey, there's a rider in front.\" So my\nmotivation immediately clicks back into\nracing instincts and I thought, \"Right,\nI think we can do this.\nas we were coming to the finish. Caught\nhim and we went from having a 200 km\ngravel race to a three up\nsprint. Now I thought I finished fourth.\nThe results at the moment suggest I was\nfifth. So, we'll wait to see what is\nactually confirmed once the race is\nfinished. It didn't all go perfectly to\nplan, but a big improvement after the\nlast race I did. And I think actually\npretty cool to finish somewhere near the\nfront of the race and be involved. I\nthink it's something I can hold my head\nup high and say that I'm I feel proud\nof. So, with that out of the way, the\nreality of the situation at hand is it's\nabout a month until I'm bound. So, my\nplans are to take the positives from\ntoday, rest up, and then I think I\nreally do need to slide as many long,\nlong rides in. I'm going to keep\nchipping away the heat training,\noptimize my\nfueling. And whilst I did struggle\ntoday, I don't think it was because I\ndidn't get the fueling right. I think at\nthe end of the day I struggled because I\ntried to ride at the front of the race\nultimately with people that are stronger\nthan me and when you're riding out of\nyour comfort zone and probably slightly\nabove your ability, that's when you're\ngoing to start to struggle at the end.\nBut I'll take that. So there you go.\nThat is Dirty Rever done and dusted. I\nhope you enjoyed this video because I\nabsolutely love making these event\nvideos and sharing them for you to enjoy\nas well. And I'll tell you what I like\nthe most is reading all of the kind\nwords everyone leaves in the comments\nsection down below. So, please do get\ninvolved. Let me know what you thought\nof the event. Let me know what you\nthought of my performance. And I'll tell\nyou what, if you're heading out to\nUnbound, well, I'll see you there. But I\ndo have a couple more videos in my Road\nto Unbound series lined up. So, keep\nyour eyes peeled for that. And if you\ndon't want to miss out, well, subscribe\nto GCN and GCN Tech and turn on\nnotifications. Right, I'm out of here.\nAnd I think I'm going to go in search of\na pizza.",

          "transcript": "We're going to the Dirty Rever. I've got\nyour present, Nick. Wait there.\nThe color matches your eyes at least.\nThank you. Okay, let's go. Good for at\nleast one, potentially two crashes.\nUnbelievable. Dirty Rever is a um gravel\nchallenge, gravel cycling challenge.\nIt's a 200 km, 130 km, or a 65 km. And\nthis is our ninth edition of it.\n[Music]\nMan, I was just so\nhard. And we had beers on the ride. I\njust like going downhill. If you edit\nthe video really well, it looked like I\nwas going fast the whole\nway to the castle to view the Deja\nRivera.\nWell, some of the dirt reverb.\nThank you so much. Excellent.\nThis is easy though, isn't it? It's just\na nice event. The roots are good, but\nit's like it's more the the expo and\npeople and hanging out. Three for a\ntenner. What do you want? You happy with\nyour stickers, Jimmy? I am. Yeah, I am.\nThat that would make a nice like cheap\ntattoo later. They come out of\nstraighter setup. You have to change\nyour depressor. Josh sat next to the\nroad crying in tears in the middle of\nnowhere because he couldn't get his pop.\nLook at it.\nYou better not get a bun, Jeremy, cuz\nI'm not going to use it on your bike.\nEven when I haven't got a bike, I leave\nthe house with the frame pump. What tire\npressure you running? 20 and 14.\nCuz I'm heavy. I need 20 in the back.\nYou know what I mean? for in the front\ngroup. Hello. Yes. Hello.\nI know. I can see you. I'm not allowed\nto. They made the route for me. Don't\nkill anybody. That's what I've been\ntold. Don't leave anybody behind. Um,\nyeah. Don't go too fast, but that's not\na problem. Lucas is in charge. No bad\ntrips. Have no idea what you're talking\nabout.\nCrushed peanut butter is a flavor. It's\nwhat I have for lunch most days in the\nshop. Now, who makes that buttery\nproduct?\nJosh P.\nGet back. Just go back to the standing\ngoodies for everybody as well. Ready for\ndirty rea? Haven't brought gravel since\nthe last\none. Classic Vary [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] gravel rides.\nThe chillest ride in the northeast. And\nwe've got at least one, potentially two\ncrashes. Unbelievable.\nJust the best. What you got there,\nCliffy? My favorite flavor. It's white\nchocolate macadamia. Good for the\nmorale. Down there.\nHow we doing? Doing brilliant, mate. How\nare you? Yeah, I'm good. I'm ready for\nthe most intense 60k I've ever done.\nI was going to say too something too\nexplicit to put on camera there.\nThat was that was the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] shot there.\nOkay, are we ready? Okay, let's go. I've\ngot the right gloves on. Look, I left\nthe normal clothes at home. These are my\ngardening ones. Oh dear. I've done the\ndirty reaver twice and I don't want to\ngive people repetitive content even\nthough I did go to a different bakery\ntoday.\nLast year I got the camper van stuck.\nThis year I've tried to set up our tent\nand I've realized we don't have the\nright pump or pegs.\nSo, backup team cycles said they'll\nrescue us by letting us sleep in their\nshop. Uh, Pox said we can sleep in their\ntent, but I think I've got a plan.\nImagine winning the 65. It's not a race,\nBen. It's not a race. I thought No. Last\nyear they said they were going to have a\nrace. You stick.\nDo you think it's\noverkill? Find a pump. And I found some\npegs. Watch this thing explode. I blew\nthat up with my mouse, by the way.\nThat's tight enough for that one to\nstart off with. I modified somebody\nelse's pump and then I've borrowed um\npegs off Cliff\nBar. So, yeah. So, we might have\nsomewhere to sleep tonight. You won't\nbecause you weren't here, but I will.\nWe're up in North Thland at Kea Castle\nand we're here for the dirty reaver.\nUm, I've got a coat of you. Thank you.\nCuz not only did I forget the pump, the\npegs, I forgot my shoes, and I forgot to\nbring any warm clothes. Thought you used\nto be in the army and you used to pack\nthings. Yeah, but I had a packing mist\nback then. You know what I mean?\nSomebody inspected it for me.\nGood night, Nick. Good night, Josh. 65\nkm. I hope you can manage. And we're\nstarting early at 900 a.m. So, you mean\nlike you're going to need your rest?\nLooked after your bike all night, mate.\nWe ready? Yeah. Made a whole list of\nstuff I need to buy for this camping. I\ngot some good um B-roll of you snoring.\nYeah, good. But I don't It doesn't\naffect me. I don't know why. It just\nJimmy was all like, \"Oh, I'll warn you\nof Nick snoring, but it just doesn't\naffect me. I can sleep anyway.\" Snoring\nis a sign of manliness. You know what I\nmean? Like, if you don't do it, I mean,\nthere's this theory I heard on the radio\nonce where a guy was talking. So, they\nhad this expert on talking about snoring\nand all these weird things and like they\ndon't know why people do it and like\nwhat's\nthe the nature? I mean, obviously they\nunderstand how it happens, but like why\nis it a thing? And then some guy rang in\nand he was like he reckons this from\nback in the day if you snored like you\nknow it warned animals to not come into\nthe caves and stuff and the radio\npresent started laughing but the guy\nthat like the expert I had on from\nCambridge or wherever he was he was like\nit's actually not a bad like line of\nthings to look into. So yeah saved you\nfrom all the lions and wild animals you\nknow and killed yeah killed warned him\noff. They're trying to reinduce links.\nSo\nmidgetes everywhere. This is the thing.\nI mean, you can't have anything nice.\nYou come to like on the border of\nScotland, lovely setting, and then you\nget these little buses trying to eat\nyou. What have you got for breakfast?\nNothing.\nWater. Why? Why would I have breakfast\nat 65K? I didn't have breakfast on a\nnormal day. M I wonder how many people\nare out there like properly panicking\ncuz it's like you know the 200k also the\nrace is starting 2 hours later. Yeah. So\npeople are going to be getting back in\nthe dark. Yeah. Yeah. Get your exposure\nlights out.\nEverybody wants us to make them grease\nvideos. So this is the most important\ngrease. You know, ask\nGrace can do a more in-depth video. This\nis the the minty one as well, so it\ntingles a little bit. Hi, guys. It's my\nfirst time there. I've never done it\nbefore. Really? Yeah. Genuinely. Yeah.\nAfter doing 4 years of gravel, it's my\nfirst time, but can't wait. It's a long\nday out. And I think even for like the\nfaster guys here, like 200k is a long\nway and it's a big day. 200k is a\nmassive long way. You're no stranger to\nthis event. How do you like this event\ncompared to others? I love the vibes of\nthis event. This is going to be my\nfourth year in a row coming here. And\nyeah, it's just great energy, great\natmosphere. Um the gravel is also pretty\ngreat, which doesn't hurt. I enjoy the\ngravel here as well. So yeah, I'm super\nexcited to be back. I I talked to a lot\nof people yesterday. People say that\nthis one is a little bit more technical\nmaybe than some other races, especially\non Europe. Do you prefer that? I do\nprefer more technical, but I wouldn't\nsay this is super technical. I'd say\nthis is quite nice and flowy. The\ngravel's a bit rougher. Um, but yeah, I\ndefinitely prefer more technical riding\nand it suits my bike as well, which has\na nice suspension fork. Welcome to the\nPanorasa Dirty Rever. Thank you very\nmuch indeed for coming. If I can have\nyour attention, today is not a\nrace. You get that? Today is about a\nchallenge and to get round safely.\nPlease, please help your friends, other\nriders if they have a problem.\nWhat's special about Dera and the area\naround Kilda? Keilder itself is unique.\nIt's a biggest forest in England. Um\nthere is multiple miles of gravel tracks\nout there and it's beautiful champagne\ngravel and it just keeps going and going\nand going. It goes through different\ntypes of forests from open lands to\nfully treed to little nice cycle trails\nnext to the reservoir and it's just a\nbeautiful place and a unique place to\nbe. The brand's here at the moment,\nthey're just doing so much. It's\nbrilliant. We've even got a a sauna on\nsite at the moment. Was that is that\nusable? Yeah, it's usable. We've got\nsauners. We've got It's all recovery\nfrom uh uh from Red Bull. They've got\nsauna. They've got ice baths. Come\non. While I wait for Nick, I'm just\ngoing to munch on a cliff bar and watch\neveryone go back.\nHow you doing? Good, mate. Are you? It's\nlush, isn't it? Nice weather. Absolutely\nlush. Dusty, dirty river. I know. Bit\nmore bit more bit more technical with\nhow washboard it is. mind in places, but\nuh we're okay with that.\nHow you doing? Hi, mate. So lovely to\nsee you again.\nHaving a good day. You're not as dusty\nas me. What do you mean? You've been in\nthe front. I've been in the back with\nslow lad. Started 35 minutes after you.\nMad. Cuz you started 5 to 9. Yeah. I'm\nrecord. I'm record you up. Call yourself\nfast lad. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hell, Joshua. Anyway,\ncan't hang out with you. Got to\ngo. That's how the\nUCI\narrow. There he\nis. There he is.\nbreaking off your\nHow we doing? Good. Not too bad. How are\nyou, mate? Yeah. Yeah, really good.\nLoving life. Perfect weather. It's\nclass, isn't it? Yeah.\n[Applause]\nTry to kill me. Josh, you could have had\na wash before you did this. Be funny\nthat you know, just be cycling in\nTurkey. You come out with a new tea.\nIt's over. Well,\nwe caugh you exactly the same spot right\nhere.\nThat's the good thing is starting at the\nback, you know, you feel fast because\nyou're just like going past people. But\nif you start in the front, that's just\nsoul\ndestroying on the Percy's.\nDeceptive out here, ain't it? No. What's\ngoing on? You put your clothes back and\nput your clothes back. You can't dress\nappropriately. Can't change halfway\nthrough. You cracked your end filter. I\nstarted with a sleeveless\nbase in the jersey. Now I don't have\nanything to carry other than my\nhippos. I've just had a beat\nthing. Be too sharp. Yeah, they're good.\nEarthy. Oh, it's pretty tough to be\nfair. I'm scared that um I'm still in\nline with Josh. I'm going to be\nstruggling towards the end to be honest.\nYeah. Don't have the legs that you do. I\nmate, you could sell me absolutely\nanything. Giant you sleem.\nHello.\nIs that good? M. Oh, delicious. Can\nrecommend. Apparently I look a bit\ndusty. I think we all look a bit Belgian\ntan. Belgian tan.\nCoconut oil. Mars bar. Marshmallows.\nBeen the first one ever made inflam.\nWe're at the front. We've managed to\npass almost everybody. If you look\nahead, there's nobody left. Nick, how\nyou doing? You all right?\nHey, you all right? Yeah. How's it\ngoing? Not bad. We're trying to get a\nshortcut so we can catch the franchise\nagain. This is definitely the shortcut.\nYeah. I've never been this happy and he\nkeen. Crack the code. Yeah. It's nice to\nbe doing something short for once. Be\nquick with that camera, man. I can't say\nto you all day. Oh, bless him. He's just\ngot that childlike enthusiasm. Then he\njust has a massive bonk every time. But\na lovely spirit. That's what it's about,\nisn't it?\nAre\nyou home?\nHey,\nheat.\nHeat. Heat.\nHeat\nup here.\nsoup. I'm going to try eat something of\neverything before we leave.\nGot into blind from Bristol. Get me a\ncoffee. Fly back tonight. I mean it's\ndedication service. Yeah. Yeah. He's not\ngetting his new bike until you know like\nif I die all the money he spent on the\ndeposit.\nIt's life insurance, isn't it?\nIs the best mini ones. Um, you got your\ncliff blocks here and you got your cliff\nminis.\nAnd get the ones with the gooey stuff\ninside. Yeah. Yeah. No. No. The nut\nbutters shoveled. Just scoop the crisp.\nIf you do, pick up your\nList as well. You know, we've got a\nclimbing\nwall. Got car seats. We've got medical\nequipment if you want to have a massive\nplate. Well, those are normal size chest\npieces to us, but they might be a bit\nbig for you then.\nready to go again. Topic over there,\nthere's a little sign that says if you\nfind the yellow balloon, you can win\nsome stuff. And on the way\nin there, a little a little yellow\nsomething peeping out of there. You\nmight have to\ninvestigate. Looks legit. Sorry, I'm\ntrying\nto It's going to pop.\nbuzzing. See what I get. So that number\non it relates to a particular prize. I\nthink that's the car. That's the washing\nmachine. Oh yeah. Can I get the ball\nspeed? Yeah. It's a Nissan Leaf.\nAmazing. Thank you so much. Yeah. No\nworries at all.\nWell, thank us when you get the prize.\nYeah. Thank you. That could be tire\nlevers. We're not sure yet. You winning\nthe 65.\nNo, I feel horrific. I don't ride my\nbike enough. First time, first gravel\nevent. So, yeah, it's pretty exciting.\nAny favorite\nbit? This last little sketchy bit coming\ndown with um the quite high grass and\nbit slippy mud. So, yeah, that was\npretty fun. This is the worst part of my\nday, I'll tell you. It's because I'm\nsitting here going, \"Am I going to miss\nher? Am I going to miss her? Do I\nremember what clothes she's wearing? Do\nI even remember her face?\" To be honest,\neveryone looks the same in Lyra. So,\nusually I just shout, \"Maddie, Maddie,\nMaddie!\" when I see anyone who\nresembles Maddie, but sometimes even men\nand women, they all look the same to me\non a bike. I'm not going to lie. It's\nthe straight up It's the Lyra. It just\nreally It's It messes with my brain.\nHave we got Swany Cam today or is it\njust Swany duties? No, we've got Swany\nCam. I'm trying. Actually, that reminds\nme. I completely forgot to film any\nSwanie cam duties. Maddie and I have\njust been forgetting cuz we've been so\nin the moment of what it means to be a\nSwany, but it is Swany cam. Um, I need\nto get my content hat on as well as my\nSwany hat on. And it's two very\ndifferent hats. Um, but hopefully\npriority is Swany mode and like focusing\non the end goal and then Swany cam is is\nsecondary to that. I'm going to work\naround it. You do what you need. Oh my\ngod. Oh my god. Ah, not good. Just look\nat my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] quads. They look massive.\nThey look really good.\nI don't think this is the correct\ndecision. Stop them. Why? Cuz now\nthey're going to hurt more. Do you need\nme to massage your quads? I will. Do you\nneed these hands to get in\nthere? There's no shame. No, wait. We\ngot this. You're doing so\nwell. God, I need to get\nsmoother. You got this. Yeah, you're\nright.\nUm\nCalm.\nThanks. Okay.\nLong time no see. Maddie, how's it\ngoing? It's okay. I'm like slightly\npacing myself. We got a tight right turn\nhere. A long day. Preparation for\ntracker. Really good prep. Yeah, my feed\nzone was pretty slick. Court did a good\njob. Nice balloon.\nDon't touch it. That's my\nballoon. Heat. Heat.\nHe's\nswinging. I always\nswing. We're giving them out. We're\nputting them in places that people\naren't to see. We're uh hiding them\nalong the course for people to get\nprizes when they get back. Kind of just\ntake one. That's not even the sport of\nit.\nCheers. Cheers. Near death experience.\nCheers. I got the video for you.\nThank you very much.\nI got that on video. He overcooked that\ncorner. so well. I mean, I overcooked it\nas\nwell. It's an easy 200k light. You just\nneed to edit in a few extra bits.\nWell done. So, you saved your ride. Uh,\nSwitch it off. Save it. Cuz if you\ndon't, you're going around again.\nWell done to the white monkey.\nWait for a bit.\nGive it a few minutes. You know,\na world first. Josh Reed washing a bike.\nDo you even know what to do? No. You\nwatched me do this a few times.\nLook at all the dirt over\nthere. Stop. Stop. Stop. And now just\nlike this. You go like that. And you do\nthat.\nThank you so\nmuch. This kid's just making a mess over\nhere. I can't reach\nit. There you go. You can do the It's\nthe problem with those lances. They're\ntoo\nlong. Congratulations.\nThe extra little prize is a set of tire\nlevers as well. What we got? Five and\n12. Five and a 12. Got to be a mountain.\nSee, this is why you don't ride 200 cuz\nif you're doing 200, you're out there in\nthis cold weather in the clouds instead\nof drinking beers. I'm relaxed, man. I\nhad fun. I'm not out there like spewing\nguts. Still riding around. Yeah. Yeah,\nlike I'm clean. I'm relaxed. There's\nsome people in some dark holes out there\nright now pushing themselves.\nWeirdos. Don't want to feel the\npressure. I've been running my tire\npretty much the entire race.\nPressure. That's good. That'll be comfy.\nOh, it's very comfy. Yeah, I was going\nto say there's no weight. No weight on\nthe front end. That's what happens when\nyou don't have a mountain on your bike.\nGood day, Stew. Good day. Yeah, enjoyed\nthat. Uh would have done under 5 hours\nif it wasn't for this tire. But uh it's\nwhat we test these things for, isn't it?\nPSI. I'm surprised it even like had any\nsquish to it at all. It's five. But\nthat's thing if you like, you know, a\nskinny lad like stew. Thank you.\nIt's brutal. Good though. Enjoy it. Did\nyou have a good day? Ah, great eye. Very\ndusty up.\nGot most of the way around cramped up at\n65K. Had to have had to have a little\nlie down. Travis, how was it? First 30.\nMan, I was just so hard.\nI'm I'm glad I sound like he had me\nriding scare for last 50k. Can you just\nhave no idea where anybody is? Um but it\nsplit to pieces after like quite early\nand there's maybe eight of us in the\nfront group and then it was just kind of\nattritional from there. We worked quite\nwell together. Um the rebel boys pushing\non the front but it was just a wicked\nday out and I think as you know like\ngravel can mean loads of different\nthings but it feels like everything\npiled into one here. Like you've got the\nkind of the pine needles that you find\nin Scandinavia and bits and pieces and\nthen the chunky gravel that you find in\nScotland. But I punctured with like 60k\nto go. Thankfully thankfully it's\nsealed. So, I was riding so gingerely\nlike on all the descents almost like\npushing my weight further forward, but\nit was great. Um, just finish.\nYeah, it was tough. I mean, uh, you can\nprobably see it on my face to be honest\nand I'm a bit of a shout, but it's it's\nwicked. Definitely be back next year.\nAnd there's warm showers. Oh, there. Oh,\nwell then there. Thank you. Hey. Hello.\nHappy birthday. Thank you very much.\nYes. kick, beer, pranks, tickets, all of\nthe above. Didn't realize I was married\nto a rat. There's a badge in a food\nkick. Well done. A good day out. Yeah,\nlovely. Started to find my legs at the\nend, ironically.\nYour crush was this year. Oh, hello\nJosh. I was chilled pier. It was lovely.\nHow was that? It was a long day. I was\non my own for 110k. Good prep for\ntracker. A bit too close to tracker, but\nyeah. Yeah, I need to eat something.\nThere were bits where I was like, I\nthink I must have done most of the\nclimbing now. And then like\nmy me and say, no, next climb coming up\nand they were like some 3 km climbs as\nwell. Yeah, pretty brutal. I also spent\na lot of time on my own. So, a lot of\ntime with my own thoughts, which is\nhard.\nI then drove up the finish and then\nthere were cyclists all around me and\nthen I had to reverse down cuz another\ncar wanted to come down. I'm lucky I\ndidn't take out another cyclist.\nHonestly, that would have been\nWell, you're here and\nnow savage\nin a good way. Done it before. Well\ndone. Hello everyone. It is the What's\nthe day today? 26th. The 28th.\nToday, 26th of April. 27th of April.\nToday it's the 26th of April, 2025. And\nthis time next year at Dirty Weaver, I\nwill be cycling in the 65 km race ride\nrace thing. Maddie probably won't sw\nMarty will probably finish the race and\nthen go back to Swani. Um, but I if all\nelse fails and I can't get a bike in\ntime, I'll just do it in Healey's. But I\nwill do it. I want to see it to believe\nit because we've done two bike rides.\nYou have little faith. We've done two\nbike rides to a local cafe for an\narmasson and courts were screaming the\nwhole time about her bum hurting. So,\nbut but it would bring me joy if she\nfound cycling as enjoyable as I find it.\nOr at least half as enjoyable. It's not\nthe bum, it's the neck as well. It's\nlike your neck's like this. Like you're\nlike a T-Rex. It's just not okay. So, if\nyou have any next suggestions, I'd love\nto have thoughts, feelings, pop it\nbelow, comments, subscribe, subscribe,\nsubscribe, watch my journey. An\nalcohol-free beer.\nGot some grass in it.\nLegend to drink with Maddie. Maddie, is\nthat we like to drink with Maddie? She\ngets it down in eight. Seven. Okay. No.\nCould you imagine? I'm not going to do\nit. I'll just have a sit.\nOh, god damn. That's fresh. That's nice,\nactually.\nRidiculous. Well, guys, you may have\nsaid dehydrated. Yeah, I had to walk up\nhills. You all right? Take your time.\nTake your time.\nSo, we have got a little character. I'm\nexpecting you.\nSo, where is he? He's coming. Give him\nthe food voucher and get him to go like\nthat. So,\nOh, thank you. Yeah.\nSo, they're expecting Let me go and\ncheck. I got\nyou. All right. Okay. Okay. They get a\nmedal or something. That's your sticker.\nThat's your patch.\nOkay.

          "description": "The Dirty Reiver is a fantastic gravel event set on an incredible course in the stunning surroundings of Kielder Castle, Northumberland. While it isn’t a race, plenty of riders push themselves to go as fast as they can — and that’s part of the appeal. Whether you choose the 65km, 130km or 200km route, it’s a brilliant personal challenge.\n\nThat’s what I love most about the Dirty Reiver: it’s all about setting your own goals. The course throws everything at you — tough climbs, tricky descents, gnarly gravel, and smooth, fast-flowing sections. The sense of achievement when you cross the finish line is genuinely something special.\n\nEntries usually open on 1st December at 8:00am, though it’s worth checking in advance in case anything changes. I’ll definitely be there in 2026 — hope to see you on the start line!\n\nIf you would like to support the channel, please consider buying Julie a coffee at https://ko-fi.com/juliephelan\n\nJulie is an ex Pro-Elite mountain biker. She is an MTB Leader and Mountain Leader. She regularly runs courses and guided trips, in the Peak District and Wales.\n\nI’ve had a few questions about the music used in my videos. Most of it is created by my long-suffering partner, Martin, using a mix of real instruments and AI-generated elements.

          "transcript": "Greetings from Kilda Castle. I'm getting\nready to ride the Dirty Reaver tomorrow.\nFor anybody who doesn't know, it's a\nhuge gravel event. Essentially not a\nrace, but you do get a time. There's a\nchoice of 65k or 130k or 200. I've\nbagged the 130k. It will be a tough ride\nof steep ups and fantastic downs.\n[Music]\nAs I've already said, it's not a race.\nPeople do try and pedal as fast as they\ncan. Other people just ride around. And\nyou know, I have spent so much of my\nlife competing. This type of event hits\nthe button so much because I can do\nwhatever I like. It's a personal\nchallenge and I will feel amazing when\nI've done it. So, taking a phrase from\nLee Craigy, there are other ways to win\nand this event allows you to do\nthat. I've got the dirty coming\nup for my bike and I'm not sure what\ntime it goes. Do I know one by or two?\nDo I go?\nThe start was absolutely bonkers.\nEveryone was quite sensible. How it's\nabsolutely amazing. It's our own\nstart. I am loving it so so\nmuch. Correct fueling strategy is so so\nimportant in a long event like this. I\nuse one 750 mil bottle per hour and a\nhalf full of carbohydrate. I have food I\ncan access easily and I love caffeine\nand the latter stages of the event. So\nbasically I follow a seafood diet.\nSeafood and eat\nit. The course is just split for the 65\noption or 130.\nSo committed\nnow. But you know, we've had a fantastic\ntime so far. We've been down steep\ndescent, steep perhaps actually in some\nof them really were steep. And um now\nI'm on a quite a nice undulating bit. So\nnot too\nbad. Need to eat more\nfood. Should I use 45 or 50 mil tires?\nTrue bless or not? Sammy says use\ntwo, but Eric says not two I go one by\nor\ntwo. Two I go. One by or\ntwo. This part of the course has been so\nmuch\neasier. Sure, we've had ups, but not\nquite as steep. And the descents have\nbeen big sweeping ones that you can fly\ndown. It needs to do a lot\nreally. and some flat\nbits. So, a welcome\nrelief. Anyway, I think we're not can't\nbe that far off from the first feed\nstation. So,\nwhoop clean.\nThis is feed station one at 50\nkilometers I think. And it couldn't have\ncome\nsooner. Apparently not just for me\neither. Woo. Simple pleasures every\ntime. We're on a large stretch of road.\nQuiet road. I'm loving\nit. I'm going to sell this bar and get\nTT bike. I\nthink it's so\nsimple. Problem is with, you know, when\nyou stop and you refuel, which you do\nneed to do. If you're somebody like me,\nafter when you get back on, your legs\nare full of lactic. You feel like a bag\nof\nspanners. Bit more road, which is good.\nthat wasty pill. You probably guessed\nthat we're on\nabout 50 55 miles something like that.\nAnd it's starting to take its toll, but\nit's for\neverybody. The mind going becomes a\nmind. Couldn't even think straight. at\nall. People are starting to struggle\nnow. I don't It's not funny. I don't\nknow why I laughed. Just seen a guy that\nwas uh lying\ndown, but he gave me a thumbs up, so he\nwas okay. And as you can see, other\npeople are just pulling over at the\nside. We're not that far off of\n100k.\nIt's just mind\ngames and correct feeding\nstrategy. That's it. Last fuel station\nand I've got 34k to go. Caffeine I've\nhad. Got a bit of spare.\nsome liquid. This is it.\nFinal push. 34K is nothing, is it? A\nwalk in the\npark. Correct pacing strategy is really,\nreally important when you do these\nevents, especially bearing in mind that\nthe first three Ks neutralize. you you\nknow you ride 3k until you get to the\ntiming mat and lots and lots of people\nat that point just go off too fast and\nit's really really easy to get carried\naway if you go too fast basically what\nhappens is you fill your legs with\nlactic and then you've got to flush that\nfrom your system so your pace goes down\nso you need to do your own thing and\nbear in mind that 130k is a long\nWhy? Oh no.\n[Applause]\nStill life in the old bird.\nI have had an absolutely amazing time.\nStarted off, it was really, really\nsteep, amazing downs, which I loved, but\nthat took its toll. And then it got a\nlittle bit easier. And then towards the\nend I was on bits of for me which was\nbit like old school mountain biking. I\nabsolutely love that bit. It's really\nreally tough but you know you get a bit\nphilosophical part the way through and\nthen you stop at a feed station and you\nrealize other people are feeling like\nthat as well and other people are at the\nwayside because they got cramp and all\nthe rest of it. But you know, if you\ntake part in something like this, you\ncan only feel really, really pleased\nwith yourself. And I am on the top of\nthe moon. I really, really hope that\nyou've enjoyed this video, and maybe\nI've inspired you to come and have a go\nat the Dirty Revena next year. I'd like\nto say a huge thank you to all those\nwonderful people who have bought me a\ncoffee. If you haven't subscribed, make\nsure that you do so you don't miss out\non anything. Thank you so much for\nwatching. You take care and have fun.\nI've got the dirty coming up and I got\nthose titanium gravel bike blues. I\ncan't afford purple for my bike and I'm\nnot sure what times to use.",

like\nthis just over an inch is all you\nneed if it's in the right place\nabsolutely I mean I've been up here\nbefore like I say but it is amazing how\nmuch just\nnothing there is up here\nbut it's cracking gravel riding\ntrails are mostly in excellent\ncondition just a lot of this rise and\nfall Falls\nday have to say it reminds me a lot of\nwhen a road in Finland donys years ago\ndoes feel a bit Arctic\nCircle unexpected\ntraffic then we got a lot of\nfolks for compan\nhe it's quite interesting you don't know\nwho's doing 130 he's doing 200 obviously\nthe 65s left us a while ago\nbut interesting to see who turns which\nway at the all important sign we' got a\nbig old climb in the feed station to go\nyet that it'll be interesting to see\nwhich I turn at the all important sign\nright some gravel observations\nwhile I'm chilling out and waiting for\nAl who's sensibly taking heel steady cuz\nhe haven't ridden in\nages\ngravel is\nspendy I mean I've seen one de

We are here\nfor the Dirty Rever. This will be my\nfourth time doing this event. And it's\nnot a race, it's a ride. Today is not a\nrace, but I will try hard. And I'm\nlooking forward to this one. I've not\nreally prepared much for this because in\nsix days time it's the tracker 360 and\nlike my head's kind of thinking track of\n360 in 6 days time which is a focus race\nof mine. But this is an amazing event to\nbe at and people are so friendly and\ntoday I led a ride with La and like\nabout I think it was like between 40 and\n50 people came which was amazing. I\nthink I'm the only person with the route\nI think. Okay. Are we ready?\nOkay. Let's go.\nHow we doing? Good. Yeah. I got the\nright gloves on. Look, I left the normal\ngloves at home. These are my gardening\nones. Swanie cam.\nI'd like to give a quick shout out to\nCourtney who's prepared race dinner when\nI got home. Mainly it was race dinner\nfor me because I don't know if you know\nwhat's happening tomorrow, but it's a\nbig day for Swanies and Swanie's got to\neat early cuz we got to be in bed early\nbecause tomorrow you've got so many\nSwany tasks for this. I\nI'm up to my eyeballs and swanie tasks.\nI'm also had to have a nap today. Rice,\nchicken, [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] some Greek yogurt wrap. I\nmight put a bit cheese on and then I'll\nprobably have some more rice. And me\npretty much the same because I'm carb\nloading for tomorrow. Um I'll see if I\nfeel like a rice. I mean like I'll see\nif I feel like a wrap. She's gone just\nrice. I've gone just rice at the moment\nand you know I'll probably have to make\na few peanut butter sandwiches just to\nreally tide me over throughout the\nnight. Cabin\ncam. Just having dinner. I'm going to be\nracing the 200 tomorrow and I'm really\nexcited. It's just a great event. And\nyeah, I've got my rice wrap for carbs\nand carbs. I need to eat more carbs\ntoday. I've not eaten enough carbs. So,\nI'm going to be on a carb mission this\nevening. Okay, so we're now on round two\nof basically the same thing. High rice\nto chicken and veggies and wrap ratio.\nIt's a long day out and I think even for\nlike the faster guys here, like 200k is\na long way and it's a big day. 200k is a\nmassive long way. You're no stranger to\nthis event. How do you like this event\ncompared to others? I love the vibes of\nthis event. This is going to be my\nfourth year in a row coming here and\nyeah, it's just great energy, great\natmosphere. Um, the gravel is also\npretty great, which doesn't hurt. I\nenjoy the gravel here as well. So, yeah,\nI'm super excited to be back. I I talked\nto a lot of people yesterday. People say\nthat this one is a little bit more\ntechnical maybe than some other races,\nespecially on Europe. Do you prefer\nthat? I do prefer more technical, but I\nwouldn't say this is super technical.\nI'd say this is quite nice and flowy.\nThe gravel's a bit rougher. Um, but\nyeah, I definitely prefer more technical\nriding and it suits my bike as well,\nwhich has a nice suspension fork. Well,\ngood l today. I hope you do a really\ngood time and yeah, enjoy yourself.\nThank you everybody that's here to\nwelcome to the Panorasa Dirty Rever.\nToday is not a\nrace. You get that. Today is about a\nchallenge and to get round safely.\nPlease, please help your friends, other\nriders if they have a problem.\nHow you feeling? I'm feeling good. I\nneed to move up a bit.\nSo, the first three kilometers were\nneutralized and then we got out of the\nneutralized section and I spotted Sophie\nand I was like, she's a good wheel to\nride with. So, I rode with her and you\ncan see this is Josh's cam here. So,\nwe're going to hop between my GoPro\nfootage and Josh did actually manage to\nget some amazing shots for me. This is\nJosh riding part of his backpack which\nhad a drone in it. Um because he went\nand shot some drone footage before\njoining back on the course later on. But\nyeah, it started unbelievably hard. Like\nmy first 10 minutes I did over 270\nwatts, which is quite hard for the start\nof a 200k gravel race. It was quite\nunnecessarily hard to be completely\nhonest with you.\ndark or dirt\nrever. How you\nfeeling? No comment.\nHeat. Hey, heat. Hey, heat.\nGuys, it's Swanie Cam, but I'm back. Did\nyou guys miss me? Preparation last night\nwas very intense. I did a 10-minute\nmeditation which turned into a 45minute\nnap. Maddie let me nap because she knew\nhow important it is for me to get my\nrest for a day like\ntoday. Heat. Heat.\nSo, for the first three hours, I got\ninto this quite good group of guys with\njust Sophie with me from the women's\nside of things. And actually, one of my\nold team managers was in it there with\nthe orange helmet for a bit. And yeah,\nso we rode together and we were riding\ntogether pretty well. At one point, we\ndid get dropped by some of the faster\nguys and Sophie turned to me and was\nlike, \"Do you want to try and get them\nagain?\" And I was like, to be completely\nhonest with you, Sophie, I actually\nwould prefer not to cuz they're really\npushing on descents and I actually it's\n200k. I'd prefer not to. And then some\nfast guys came around us again and then\nwe we got in their wheels, too. So, we\nactually ended up riding pretty damn\nhard for the first 3 hours. And then at\nabout 3 hours in, I just thought like,\ndo you know what? I have pushed quite\nhard for 3 hours. Got another 4 and 1/2\nor so to go. And I don't think it's\nsensible for me to keep pushing at this\npace, especially considering that I have\na 360 km race in 6 days. So, I kind of\neased off and it was actually after this\nbit here. This is when the faster guys\ncame through around us and we got in\ntheir group for a bit. But my GoPro did\ndie in a bit. But yeah, so I decided to\nkind of ease off and ride my own pace\nfor the rest of the\nday. Very stressed right now. You've\ncaught me at a stressful moment. This is\nthe worst part of my day, I'll tell you.\nIt's because I'm sitting here going, \"Am\nI going to miss her? Am I going to miss\nher? Do I remember what clothes she's\nwearing? Do I even remember her face? To\nbe honest, everyone looks the same in\nLyra. So, usually I just shout, \"Maddie,\nMaddie, Maddie!\" when I see anyone who\nresembles Maddie. But sometimes, even\nmen and women, they all look the same to\nme on a bike. I'm not going to lie,\nMaddie.\nYou're doing so well. We got this.\nYou're doing so well. Take off that\nvest.\nWow. Wow. God, I need to get smoother.\nYou got this. Yeah, you're right.\nUm, thanks.\nOkay, I'm second. Yeah, you are. Yeah,\nthere's only one pass. Mad doing really\nwell when she came to the feed. She was\nin quite a good mood. Little chatty\nKathy. And by that I meant she was like,\n\"Hey.\" And I was like, and she was like,\n\"Okay, I need my water now. Now, my\njob's basically done for today. Swanic\ncam is pretty chilled one, but we're\nThis is just preparation, you know, for\nthe tracker, which is happening next\nweek. Tune in for more Swany Cam then.\nAnd yeah, I'm feeling good about my my\njob. I feel like I did a good job today.\nI\ndidn't scream too loudly or like say\nembarrassing things. So, that was good.\nI was just I was very professional\ntoday.\nLong time no see. Maddie, how's it\ngoing? Oh, it's okay. Yeah, I'm like\nslightly pacing myself. We got a tight\nright turn here. Too hard. Yeah,\n200k. It's a long\nday. Yeah, we were just pushing a bit\nhard, so I let them go on a time.\nPreparation for tracker. Really good\nprep. Yeah, my feed zone was pretty\nslick. Court did a good job.\nEnjoying the new bike? Yeah, I love it.\nSo fun. Does look fun. It's really good\nfun. Fun on the\nsense. This is a really fun course. I'm\na bit\nmucky.\nHeat.\nHeat. Heat. Heat.\nSo, an update on Swany Cam. I was like,\nyou know what? It'll be good if I go for\nlike a little run. I've somehow ended up\non the course.\nSo, I'm cheering cuz the Swan's job's\nnever done. Oh, people are coming. Go\non. You've got this.\nYou've got\nthis. Just Just cheering, just having a\ngreat time. I think she was Australian.\nIt's a bit\nfar. Yes.\nSo Josh was doing the 65k which\nbasically joined back on with our 200k\nroute. So he rode behind me for a bit\ngetting some content for me which was\nsuper lovely of him. But yeah, I\nbasically rode on my own for the rest of\nthe rest of the race. There were a\ncouple of moments where I found a few\npeople, but I pretty much was solo in\nthe wind just pushing my own pace for\n110 km.\nSo much\nfun. Heat. Heat.\n[Applause]\nOh my\ngod. Sending it.\nI get so hard.\nGood prep for\ntracker. A bit too close to tracker, but\nyeah.\nOkay, I need to eat something. I felt\nreally like quite sick.\nShould I go on?\nUh, I can go get it. It's court's here.\nNot fair, is it? Is it quite a good\nlook?\nYou've like covered your tan lines with\nI need to go wash my face.\nI don't know why that is such a\nhard bre so much dust that I was like\ncoughing.\nUm, just tell us about that words.\nIt's a brutal course. Like I felt like I\nwas climbing pretty much the entire day.\nThere were bits where I was like I think\nI must have done most of the climbing\nnow and then like my would like beep at\nme and say no next climb coming up and\nthey were like some 3 km climbs as well.\nYeah, pretty brutal. I also spent a lot\nof time on my own. spend a lot of time\non my own thoughts which is hard. You\nwere saying there that you were in a\ncouple of groups and you wouldn't\ndecided whether to sort of push to save\nthe group or just ride your own pace.\nThe decision was just to ride your own\npace in the end. Was it? Yeah. I stuck\nwith the group for just over 3 hours and\nit was a really good group. We were\nworking really well. But I like looked\ndown at the power I was pushing out and\nI was like, do you know what? I actually\nthink I should just ride my own pace\notherwise I'm going to blow up. So, I\nlike held back a bit and then just rode\nmy own pace the rest of the day, which\nis actually quite nice. It's quite nice\nto ride on your own sometimes. Yeah.\nWell, as they say, to finish first,\nfirst first you have to finish, don't\nyou? So, a lot of people are saying,\neven though it's not the most technical\ncourse here today, some of those dusty\ngrally corners have been catching people\nout. Has it been quite tricky? You've\nbeen drifting around a bit. Yeah,\nthere's some loose gravel over the\nsurface. You just have to be really\ncareful um and like scrub off speed\nbefore the corners. But yeah, I think\nI'm always like quite careful when it\ncomes to like I don't like to take risks\nin races. Um, so yeah, just I saw a car\nfull of people come off. Um, but it\ndoesn't look like too many people are\nhurt. Some mature racing for sure.\nThat's something I never learned. I\ncould always took too many risks then\ntoo much time in hospital. So what are\nyour plans going forward after this\nweekend? What's up next for you? So I'm\nflying to Jerona tomorrow for the\ntracker on Friday. So that's 360k. And I\nhave to say, I did this race before it\nlast year as well. And doing a 200k\nrace, six days before a 360k race just\nkind of makes you really question your\nlife decisions. And I'm really not sure\nI want to do 360k in 6 days. But I've\ngot 6 days to recover and like convince\nmyself that it's a good idea. And I'm\nsure I'll have a great time doing it.\nWell, good luck with that. Go and get\nyourself something to eat and a beer.\nAnd I'm sure you can get our recovery\nsorted. Cheers. Thank you so much. No\nworries. Thank you. You just\nspend your entire time like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]\nyourself. You get on the gate with like\neight of the people like I then drove up\nthe finish and then there were cyclists\nall around me and then I had to reverse\ndown cuz another car wanted to come\ndown. I'm lucky I didn't take out\nanother cyclist. Honestly, that would\nhave been\nWell, you're here now. How was your day?\nIt feels like it's about to say do you\nwant to just sit here for a while or are\nwe going to do it in the morning? Hello\neveryone. It is the What's the day\ntoday? 26th. The 28th.\nToday it's the 26th of April, 2025. And\nthis time next year at Dirty Weaver, I\nwill be cycling in the 65 km race ride\nrace thing. Going to be team one year.\nMaddie probably won't\nswadd me. Um, but I if all else fails\nand I can't get a bike in time, I'll\njust do it in Healey's. But I will do\nit.\nWhat do you think of that?\nI want to see it to believe it because\nwe've done two bike rides. You have\nlittle faith. We've done two bike rides\nto a local cafe for an arm and quason\nand courts were screaming the whole time\nabout her bum hurting. So, but but it\nwould bring me joy if she found cycling\nas enjoyable as I find it or at least\nhalf as enjoyable. Subscribe. Subscribe.\nWatch my journey.\nThat is another dirty reverb done and\ndusted quite literally. I'm just packing\nmy bike cuz I'm flying to Dona this\nafternoon for the tracker on Friday. I\ndon't know how I'm going to do 360k in 5\ndays\ntime. Yesterday was really good fun. I\nfeel like it was fun for half of it and\nI'd be lying if I said I had a great\ntime all day. I did I think it was like\n234 normalized power. like 254 watts\nnormalized for the first three hours is\nwhat my coach said, which is like if\nthat was a standalone like 4hour race\nthat normalized, I'd be like that's a\npretty hard race. So yeah, to then do\nanother 4 and 1/ half hours after\nthat was\nhot. But yeah, I'm packing\nup just say goodbye to my LA friends,\nwhich is sad. So we stayed here in this\nlittle cabin with LA this week, this\nweekend. and good just say goodbye to\nour friends.\nUm we'll see them again in Iceland for\nthe rift which is very exciting. But\nyeah, I'm sort of alive, sort of not\nhalf functioning. Um but yeah, recovery\ntime now for Friday. You never know.\nThat could have been a really good\ntraining stimulus for Friday. At least\nit's told me that 360k is a really\nreally long way because 200k was a\nreally really long way.\npriority is Swany mode and like focusing\non the end goal and then Swany cam is is\nsecondary to that. Got to take it\nseriously. Imagine if I just missed her\nright now. Stretch up. You stretch.\nHow's it going? Can you stretch?\nI'm going to work around you. You do\nwhat you do. How's it going? Ah, not\ngood. Just look at my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] quads.\nThey look massive. No, they just like\nthey look really good. I don't think\nit's the correct decision to stop them.\nWhy? Cuz now they're going to hurt more.\nDo you need me to massage your quads? I\nwill. Do you need these hands to get in\nthere?\nThere's no shame. No, wait.\nLook at them. I've had to stop my run\nearly because I can't I can't run on\nthat. I don't know how people stay up on\ntwo wheels on this terrain because a\ngirl can't even stay up on two feet.\nI've been falling left, right, and\ncenter. It's going to be a mental health\nwalk instead of a little run today.\nGuys, look how cool this is. I'm just in\nthe forest. I was going to go walking\nthrough it to get to the path, but then\nI thought, what if I walk through it and\nI got caught in like a bear trap? I\ndon't know if those even exist just in\nlike films and movies, but I was like,\n\"Well, then I won't be at Maddiey's\nfinish and she will have no idea where I\nam and I'll be stuck in a bear trap.\"\nSo, I'm going to decide against that and\nprobably just stick to the road. But, I\nhad a little\nwonder. Can you hear the\nbirds? Nice chatting to you guys. Missed\nyou\nall. Bye.",

Located on the England-Scotland border, the course features 3,500m of elevation gain over 200km with immediate challenging terrain after a neutralized start. Riders describe the gravel as rougher and more technical than some European events, but still flowy rather than super technical. The event starts with pretty hilly terrain early on and what riders call a spicy start straight onto rough stuff. While officially not a race but a timed challenge, competitive riders do race at the front. The atmosphere is praised for great energy and friendly vibes, with emphasis on helping other riders and finishing safely. Preparation includes significant carb loading the night before, with riders consuming rice, wraps, and peanut butter sandwiches. Even experienced riders note that 200km is a massive distance requiring proper preparation and early rest."
