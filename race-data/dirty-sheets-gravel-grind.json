        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Kevin Akers describes \"lots of hills that are brutal when you're tired,\" capturing how the rolling terrain accumulates difficulty over distance. The consistent climbing through Georgia's piedmont region creates sustained effort rather than dramatic peak moments, wearing down riders progressively."

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Weather swings wildly: Robert Durham reported \"Never seen it this dusty\" in May 2019, while Donald LeRoy rode through \"rainy day\" conditions in March. Casey Wichman encountered \"a little mud on last 5 miles\" in May 2021, showing Georgia's unpredictable seasonal patterns affect course conditions significantly."

      "prestige": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "2024 results show Brock Mason winning the 102-mile in 4:52:50, with 16th place Logan Hunt finishing in 7:45:23—a nearly three-hour spread indicating regional competition rather than elite depth. The $3,000 prize purse split between men and women suggests ambition exceeding current field strength."

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Race organizers acknowledge the rough edges: \"It's not polished. It's not easy.\" Multiple distance variations and hand-thrown ceramic trophies show care for participant experience, but the emphasis on \"Type 2 fun and courses with bite\" suggests challenging logistics match the challenging terrain."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Post-race includes \"enough to make you happy and then some\"—feast with vegetarian and meat options, drinks, entertainment, plus free photography downloads. The Thursday fire pit pickup with s'mores and planned camping at MTB Atlanta HQ create multi-day community gathering rather than single-event transaction."
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Registration proceeds fund MTB Atlanta trail building and maintenance, connecting racing to local trail advocacy. The name plays off the area's \"Silk Sheets\" road cycling reputation—\"Dirty Sheets\" as the \"unruly counterpart.\" Harold Solomon captured the appeal: \"Remarkable to have this so close to Atlanta.\""

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Times span from Jason Thomas's 1h 23m effort to Mary Hawthorne's 4h 31m recreational ride, showing wide participation but limited elite depth. The 2024 men's field stretched over nearly three hours from winner to mid-pack, suggesting strong regional participation without national competitive draw."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Hand-thrown ceramic trophies from Grouchy Ass Pottery Studio and the organizers' note that \"the real flex\" is \"Ceramic Glory\" over cash prizes shows personality-driven value proposition. Registration starting at $70 with proceeds supporting local trail building connects individual participation to community infrastructure investment."
