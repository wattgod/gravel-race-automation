The course includes a technical single track section and steep, short punchy climbs through chunky rough terrain. These climbs are particularly notable because success depends heavily on line selection - riders who pick good lines can power through, while others may need to walk. The route covers approximately 20 miles around the Chattahoochee Hills area near Atlanta. Riders emphasize that while the course has challenging sections, it remains accessible to a range of skill levels, making it a popular choice for group rides and social events in the gravel cycling community."
