Registration 7:30-8:45 AM at Argyll Hotel with mandatory briefing creates a tight window. Routes download via Komoot for self-navigation to Carrick Castle campsite, though one rider noted \"navigational blunders\" as part of the challenge."

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "137km over two days with 2,350m climbing breaks down to roughly 64km day one, 73km day two. Brett Cotter admits he's \"not the fastest or most skilled rider\" but found the distance manageable for weekend adventure riding. The format prioritizes exploration over athletic challenge, with ample time for cafe stops and chatting with fellow riders along gravel tracks."
      },
      "technicality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Mixed terrain includes singletrack, gravel tracks, forestry roads through Scottish hills above Dunoon. James from North Wales found his Sonder Broken Road Pinion \"perfect for the trip,\" while others eyed Brett's loaner Deviate Highlander II for the \"gnarly descents.\" The 45mm tire requirement and route design suggest challenging but accessible technical demands."
      },
      "elevation": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Day two features \"tough gravel climb\" after gentle lochside start, plus \"more climbing at Hell's Glen\" - officially Glen Iarainn (Iron Glen) but sounds like nearby Glen Ifhrinn (Glen of Hell). The 2,350m total gain over two days provides steady climbing through Scottish terrain without overwhelming weekend riders seeking adventure over punishment."

      "climate": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Late September conditions in 2024 started \"overcast\" Saturday morning, though one video mentions \"epic weather.\" Required gear list mandates \"wet-weather gear\" for good reason in western Scotland. Brett Cotter braved a cold swim in Loch Goil after day one, suggesting typical Scottish autumn conditions with variable weather patterns."
      },
      "altitude": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Sea-level Cowal Peninsula with rolling hills means altitude is irrelevant. Routes climb through \"hills and forests above Dunoon\" with views over the peninsula, but maximum elevations barely register. The lochside camping at Carrick Castle confirms this is coastal Scottish terrain where weather matters more than thin air."
      },
      "adventure": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Bikepacking format through the rugged Cowal Peninsula delivers Scottish adventure – wild landscapes, proper camping, and routes that showcase why this coastline has reputation. Two days exploring terrain most people never see, with support but real remoteness. Just don't confuse adventure with athletic challenge."
      },
      "prestige": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Sure, it's 'Scotland's longest running gravel event' since 2019, but that's like being the tallest dwarf. 100 riders max, no prize purse, no pro field – this is a friendly camping trip with bikes. Gets mentioned in some gear mag roundups, but so does every event that sends a press release."
      },
      "race_quality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Markus Stitz designs solid routes through Scottish terrain, with organizers noting \"this is the third rendition of the DDD and the route was 'fine-tuned' for this year's edition.\" However, the event philosophy states \"It's not a bloody race • Don't be a dick,\" making this a well-organized adventure weekend rather than competitive racing experience."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Riders describe it as \"hard to tell whether it was a bike ride or just hanging out with loads of new friends.\" The Blairmore Café stop shows \"bikes strewn and scattered around the front lawn\" as riders wait for \"delicious home-baked goodies.\" Self-supported bikepacking with castle camping and catered meals creates memorable Scottish adventure atmosphere."
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "They push the 'big riding family' vibe hard, and returning riders suggest people enjoy the laid-back approach. But 100 people across two days in the Scottish countryside means you're mostly riding alone. It's intimate by default, not by design."
      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "No competitive element, no timing, no prize money means zero reason for serious riders to show up. E-bikes welcome, 45mm minimum tire requirement, broom wagon support – they're actively catering to the 'just happy to finish' crowd. If you're looking for someone to push your pace, look elsewhere."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "£94-99 entry includes routes, campsite accommodation, dinner, breakfast, and broom wagon support for a two-day Scottish adventure. Camping beside Carrick Castle with catered meals by Winston Churchill catering plus cafe stops creates an all-inclusive bikepacking weekend. The package eliminates typical event logistics while delivering castle camping and proper adventure experience."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Getting to Dunoon requires train to Gourock then ferry connection – classic Scottish transport pain. No direct airport access, and you're looking at Glasgow as your entry point plus ground transport. The inclusive meal package saves money, but the remote location means every mistake costs extra."
