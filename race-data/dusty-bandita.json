        "explanation": "Two distance options at 45 miles (~3,000 ft) and 80-85 miles (~5,400 ft) give proper choice, with staggered start waves at 8 AM and 10 AM. Strangerin_thealps proved the 45-mile distance demands respect: \"I really focused on hill and speed work and let the distance slide during training and my methodology seemed to work\" for their first race. The 80+ miles puts you into serious gravel territory without being gratuitously long. Similar distance to Crusher in the Tushar."

Technical enough to matter with equipment recommendations for 38mm+ tires. Similar technical demands to Gravel Worlds."

        "explanation": "Starting around 4,100 feet in Ovando, the climbing profiles pack 3,000 feet into 45 miles or 5,400 feet into 80+ miles with \"big climbs\" emphasized. For Strangerin_thealps, this represented their \"biggest day of climbing\" in their first year of cycling. The elevation gain is earned through proper Montana terrain without being punitive, with aid stations positioned at climb base and summit. Similar elevation profile to Gravel Worlds."

        "explanation": "Historical weather data shows average highs of 72°F and lows of 46°F, with a 49% chance of rain on any given day. Early June means \"spring in Montana, expect any and all weather!\" according to founder Bri Lui. The 2023 edition dealt with snowpack concerns that \"did finally melt in time,\" creating water runoff on descents. Race organizers adjust courses based on snowpack conditions, meaning weather directly dictates your race experience in unpredictable mountain climate. More weather exposure than Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."
      },
      "altitude": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Starting elevation around 4,100 feet in Ovando puts you in noticeable altitude territory that most riders adapt to quickly. The remote location means \"there is no cell service\" on course, emphasizing the backcountry setting. High enough to thin the air and require mandatory course downloads and emergency phones, but manageable for most properly prepared riders. Similar altitude considerations to Grinduro."
      },
      "adventure": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Two Wheeled Inspiration noted \"the significant number of women who opted to stop in the middle of roads or on blind corners\" during remote descents with limited visibility. Race organizers require bear spray due to active grizzly presence - \"the huge pile of scat on the ascent to the second aid station\" confirmed bears were in the area. You're racing through Montana backcountry where \"there is no cell service\" and emergency preparedness matters."

        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Founded in 2022, this women-only event registers minimal impact on the national gravel scene. The race sold out in \"less than 2.5 hrs\" but that's a field of 31 riders based on Strangerin_thealps finishing \"25/31\" in the short course. Prize purse was added for 2026 ($1000 for 85-mile winner), but prestige takes years to build in remote Montana locations."

        "explanation": "Two Wheeled Inspiration confirmed \"the course was very well marked, with both signage, and volunteers\" directing traffic and managing aid stations with \"pre-packaged snacks and fluids for topping off bottles.\" However, aid station placement drew criticism: \"I would have liked to see these spread out a bit more\" with stations only five miles apart. Course curation includes mandatory bear spray and emergency phone requirements."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Two Wheeled Inspiration described the hidden finish: \"The very last quarter mile was up a slight hill and the finish line was hidden around a corner in the heart of the town square. When you finally crested the hill and came around the corner, there were hoards of people gathered in the town square to watch finishers.\" Small-town charm creates memorable moments when execution works, but depends entirely on embracing remote Montana authenticity over polished production."

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "The women+ format creates an empowering environment as founder Bri Lui explains: \"if we see someone like us lining up at the start line and racing, there will be others who will follow, thinking 'I think I can do that too.'\" Two Wheeled Inspiration felt the \"inclusivity and support\" especially at the finish line with applause and announcer treatment. Gender-specific programming builds confidence but limits overall community scale in remote locations."

        "explanation": "Women-only field topped out at 31 riders in the 45-mile course based on Strangerin_thealps finishing \"25/31\" in what was described as their first race ever. The race sells out quickly but field size remains tiny even with rapid registration. No mention of competitive depth, elite riders, or notable results beyond recreational participants celebrating personal achievements in remote Montana. Thinner field than Ouray Gravel Grinder."

        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "At $144-160, you get well-marked courses, aid stations with \"olives and pickles\" plus standard snacks, post-race food, and sponsor goodies in a supportive women+ environment. The 2026 prize purse adds $1000 for 85-mile winners and $250 for 45-mile winners, with 20% of proceeds donated to MT Alpha Cycling. For specialized programming and Montana logistics, the pricing hits reasonable territory."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Registration runs $75-100. Limited Ovando lodging means Blackfoot Valley Inn 5 miles away, City Center Motel room blocks, or bear-aware camping after a 2021 grizzly tent attack. Mandatory bear spray adds gear costs, and Strangerin_thealps experienced multiple chain throwing incidents suggesting pre-race bike prep expenses. Remote location an hour from Missoula means travel costs compound quickly for what amounts to a 31-rider field experience. Higher total cost than Badlands."
