      "value": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "New events typically undercharge to build participation, and Belgian races generally offer solid value compared to premium European events. You get two distance options and integration with a larger cycling festival for likely reasonable entry fees. The infrastructure costs are shared across the GRANFONDO weekend, keeping individual event costs down."
