          "transcript": "Hi guys, welcome to my first voice over\nvideo. Let's say a bit of a breakdown of\nhow my race went.\nI was already planning on doing this for\nmy race at gravel turnout, but that\ndidn't go as I planned. I had a puncture\nafter uh 15 minutes already. So, yeah,\nmy race was quickly over.\nSo, I just posted my my race start if\nyou're interested in that. But for this\nrace, it was my second race of the\nseason, dusty gravel in\njust before this race, I went to the\nprovince and I did a good good week of a\nlot of training. Um, with the race in\ntotal, I almost did 20 hours that week,\nwhich is something I definitely don't do\na lot.\nSo for this race at the start line I\nfelt that my legs were were a bit tired\nbut I was very much looking forward to\nto racing especially when turnout um\ndidn't go as I as I hoped for.\nBut if I'm honest, um I'm doing this\nrecap uh now on the\n2nd of July, which is a bit late later\nthan I planned. Um and I already raced\nsome other races as well.\nI even have the feeling that that maybe\nwas my best race of the season, even\nthough it is a bit strange that my\ntraining load was very high that week.\nBut yeah, it's also\na mental game sometimes. Um, it's almost\nas if when I'm doing a lot, I'm really\npushing my body that in my head I feel\nway more confident about myself than\nwhen I'm having just a regular week, I\nmust say, or or just I I had really good\nlegs at that's also on a an possibility.\nSo yeah, as we are well underway in this\nvideo and in my race as well, you have\nalready seen some some footage of the of\nthe race start, which is always really\nreally hard. Something something I\nreally struggle with. Um, honestly, it's\nit's just so so hard in the beginning\nand I just really trying to to hang on\nand then yeah,\nit's definitely I need to something I\nthat I need to work on. But yeah, after\nquite some time, the race always uh\nslows down a bit or at least the groups\nI I'm in. Um, and then for me, the the\nreal race can start.\nThat's also the moment that you really\nneed to uh to have a good group around\nyou. Uh because yeah, the race is long\nand doing a lot of on your own is is not\nideal.\nBut yeah, my race start didn't go uh\nperfectly. I didn't had a puncture or\nanything, but my um\nmy uh how do you say English? I beatles\nfell out of my bike. So yeah, I had to\nstop and\nI was really bummed because I I sat in a\ngood group. Um and later on I tried with\nanother guide\nto get back to them which cost a lot of\nenergy but we managed to be able to get\nthat to get back in the group I was in\nat the start. You can also see um the\ngroup I'm talking about is uh we're also\nthe the Belgian jersey of Kim Kaps is\nriding here\nsince I'm doing this recap quite late.\nUm I'm really thinking about what else\nhappened during that race. But when I\num got back in the group uh I just yeah\nstayed in the group. Nothing nothing\nspecial happened after that.\nI didn't have any clue where exactly I\nwas\nfor which place I was competing for.\nUm after some time my chain fell off\ntwice\nwhich I yeah which resulted in the in a\nloss of contact with that group again.\nUm but yeah, I was also feeling quite\ntired at that point\nbecause um yeah, later on you also see\nme um crash.\nI don't really know how that happened\nhonestly. It was just like um a small\ngrass pot and suddenly my front wheel\ndisappeared and yeah I found myself on\nthe ground. I lost some time there but\nyeah I was already pretty tired\nat that point. Um and from that point\nonwards I just rode on until the finish.\nSo, as the footage keeps on uh playing\nin the background, maybe I will give you\nsome information about myself because\nyeah, this quite this is quite random.\nSo, my name is Lawrence Clyice and um\nI'm competing in gravel races trying to\nget my um qualification ticket for\nthe World Championships this year. But\nas I've done three races already, I\nthink. Yeah.\nBut the level of just um an amateur or\nhow you would or how you would want to\ndescribe it is actually high. At least\nfor me it is. I am doing some proper\ntraining but I I'm really struggling to\nyeah to be in the top 25%\nwhich is needed to qualify for the world\nchampionship.\nSo yeah, one of the key reasons I lack a\nlot of fitness is because during the\nwinter\num yeah, life got busy, especially\nschool and and extracurricular activity\nwhich um needed yeah a lot of time. So\nyeah, I think I almost spent two at\nleast maybe three times off my bike.\nYeah, it's definitely not something you\nwant. So I had to\nbuild back up from the end of January\nJanuary when my exams passed.\nUh which yeah wasn't wasn't easy or at\nleast I did my best and I am quite\ntrained right now but definitely not\nenough to qualify.\nBut that is also part of the reason that\nI want to break these videos or break\nthese races down. Um, just to to share\nmy experience to document my journey on\ntrying to become the best version of my\nof myself on the bike.\nUm, in combination with the challenge of\nof life, of of school, of social\nactivities.\nUm,\nso yeah, I'm just an uh an average Joe.\nIf you uh you want to follow the life\nand the challenges that uh the average\nJoe encounters with in the chase of uh a\nworld championship qualification ticket.\nYou definitely don't need to follow me\nif you're interested in seeing uh racing\ncontent uh being at the front because\nthat's not something you'll see um on\nthis channel at least for now. I'm\ntrying to get as best to the best level\nas I can, but it's it's not easy. Yeah,\nfor the rest I would say enjoy the rest\nof the footage and I'll catch you next\ntime.\nSo you know finish it down.",

The course includes technical sections with small grass pots that can catch your front wheel and cause crashes. Mechanical issues are common, with riders experiencing problems like pedals falling out and chains dropping multiple times during the race. The race is long enough that group dynamics become crucial - riders emphasize the importance of finding a good group since doing a lot of the race alone is not ideal. After the intense opening, the race typically slows down and groups form, which is when the real racing begins. The level of competition is described as high even at the amateur level, with riders using this race as qualification attempts for World Championships."
