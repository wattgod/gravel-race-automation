Drop bags collected at registration create complexity, and GPS navigation is mandatory for Mains since the course isn't fully marked. Waimate remains a small agricultural town with infrastructure challenges for mass participation events.

Mackenzie Pass features 'an excruciating straight headwind section' before a 4km climb at 6.3% gradient. The elevation creates selection without dominating, as one rider noted it 'didn't feel that hilly overall' despite the substantial vertical gain. Similar elevation profile to Gravel Worlds.

Charlotte Clarke's pre-race recon hit winds so severe she was 'pinned by the wind against a fence, hanging on for dear life' while Caleb struggled with a bike that 'wouldn't stay upright.' Race day 2025 brought surprisingly hot conditions that eliminated drafting benefits. Similar climate challenges to SBT GRVL."
