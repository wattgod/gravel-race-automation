Drop bags collected at registration create complexity, and GPS navigation is mandatory for Mains since the course isn't fully marked. Waimate remains a small agricultural town with infrastructure challenges for mass participation events.

Multiple crashes occurred at ford crossings despite rider caution. Similar technical demands to Gravel Worlds.

Mackenzie Pass features 'an excruciating straight headwind section' before a 4km climb at 6.3% gradient. The elevation creates selection without dominating, as one rider noted it 'didn't feel that hilly overall' despite the substantial vertical gain. Similar elevation profile to Gravel Worlds.

Charlotte Clarke's pre-race recon hit winds so severe she was 'pinned by the wind against a fence, hanging on for dear life' while Caleb struggled with a bike that 'wouldn't stay upright.' Race day 2025 brought surprisingly hot conditions that eliminated drafting benefits. Similar climate challenges to SBT GRVL."

          "transcript": "[Music]\nhi guys Jace here well I'm here in the\ntown of w mati beautiful little town in\nsouth island of New Zealand about 20\nminutes or so outside of\nTimaru now there's several distances in\nthis race the main\nentree starter and taster and I am doing\nthe entree because I'm not that silly\nwell I'm a little bit silly the Entre ra\n140k and that should take around the 6\nhour mark I'm hoping but my first gravel\nrace ever no pressure just going to\nenjoy it go with the\nflow and see how it\ngoes there's a group of about 10 of us\ncame down from Oakland to do the race so\nit's a little bit of a nice\nExpedition flight was good it was about\na 2 and 1/ half to 3 hour drive from on\nChrist Church\naort\ndepends all\nright here we go come on through the\ngate Bunch up a little bit don't be\nscared this isn't the\nstar going to go out on the road\nshortly let's go\nwooo\ncrushing so that was\nbit of a full deep gravel in front\nof\nme got a bit of graze on my elbow I\nthink that's about it so on way till\nafter about 6K the gravel hit it's\npretty deep here and that's what\nhappened stay on your line there's no\none front or behind now\noh trying to hang\non Troy's wheel 23k gone the thing about\ngravel is that there's long straight\nroads everywhere thankfully it isn't\nhorrendously windy also you seem to be\non your own a little bit although there\nis a group in front of me hopefully I\ncan get there and work with\nthose and have a bit of company\n[Applause]\nfrom 30k is gone my back is screaming\nalready I need suspension that's what I\nneed it's beautiful out here pretty\nRelentless straight roads\nup it's definitely the bike I wish I\nwish I was on my epic evil right now\nyeah what's your name Sean Sean yeah hey\nI'm Jason I Jason good have you done\nthis before no first one yeah me too\nit's actually my first uh race if you\nwant to call it that in the last seven\nyears oh injured on too much life going\non uh both oh\nyeah okay 50k gone and now I've managed\nto put the the camera on super wide\nwhere it wasn't before so sorry about\nthat just managing the back really and\ntrying to get through it quite\nRelentless lots of straits and it's\nrolling kind of\nHills some thick gravel some not so\nthick the thing about gravel is you're\nalways searching for the smoothest\nline if there is one\ndownhill is are quite\ncool woo look at\nthis that's okay I think went about 3\nhours and 5 minutes\nso on for something like\n6 uh\n15 262 thank\nyou how's it going good couldn't do much\nbut see\n3 hours and 6 minutes 70k done halfway\nthere on my own Billy no\nmates it's a little bit chilly but the\ntemperature is pretty good for\nriding I actually feel okay at the\nmoment yes my back is a little bit stiff\nevery down there for Fitness while it's\npretty good pretty happy just finished\nmy Camel Back\nmy used be H as I roll into that H\nstation\nthere so that's pretty\ngood so electric is\nokay got two BS now dropped off the\nback just need to wait or find some\nfriends 82 km in feeling okay past one\nperson in the last 12K I've seen I see\nthree people a few hundred meters in\nfront of me so I'm going to try to catch\nthose and maybe join the group or pass\nthem got more guys here to try to\ntake I think I'm maintaining my Pace but\neveryone else seems to be slowing down\nover take taking about five or six since\nthe turn around 105k gone 35 to\ngo feeling okay A bit of a hill here but\ngood thing is I can see a few people\nthrough\nChase all right get tired I've got 10K\nto go I'm on 535 so got 25 minutes to do\ndidn't to get into the 6 hours I'm we\ngoing to do it I guess the chase is on\nthere think this\nway\ncheers 2\nminutes right while I'm just about to\nkill myself to get under 6 hours I\nthought I'd give you a few thoughts on\nthis event oh by the way this is a\npretty unique finish you got to do two\nlaps around the vadrum which was\nestablished and built in 1891 by the way\nin W\nmati so the event I just thought it was\nreally well organized by Andy and his\ncrew it looks like they put the\ncommunity at the Forefront of addition\nzero and as he says on his website it\nwas created with a specific intent to\ncreate a welcoming gravel racing\ncommunity that is hosted by the whole\ncommunity and I agree with that\nwholeheartedly I'll be very surprised if\nit isn't\nalready there that it's the preeminent\ngravel race in New Zealand and the one\nto do my race was pretty good so power\nresults wise 77th out about 115 but it\ndid have that crash at about 10K and I\nwas solo for most of the rest of the way\nI started perking up at about 50 60k and\nthen rode well and no one overt me over\ntook about a dozen people in the second\nhalf it was front loed with uh elevation\nso 1100 M the first half 900 M the\nsecond half but overall it was pretty\ngood stunning scenery the temperature\nwas great and it didn't feel that hilly\noverall for me the entree was a good\nplace to start it was a nice sweet spot\ndidn't want to go too long and have too\nmuch time in the cell would have\nprobably taken me 11 hours maybe a bit\nmore to do um the\nmains\n58 59 minutes quicker than last year\nwe'll just round that up to an hour\nawesome I started feeling better you\nknow so kind of yeah no one over took me\nin the second hour which is nice\nDave Dave\nokay well that's it addition Z in the\nback but I do it again actually if You'\nasked\nme at about the 50k point I would have\nsaid\nno but towards the end yes I think I\nwould do it again um I got to about 50\nto 60k 60k probably and then started\nfeeling okay pretty good got to the turn\naround uh AG station about 70 Kish\nand no one overtook me after that and I\novertook about 15 people I was feeling\npretty good most of the time uh and as\nyou just saw I sneaked in under the 6h\nhour mark so I did have to work hard\nuntil the very end I didn't really want\nto but I did in the end hopefully I got\nsome good footage and if you want to\nknow any questions just drop me in the\ncomments below\nand see if I can answer them cuz now I'm\nan expert after my one reel ride of\ncourse I am thanks for\nwatching if you like the content and I\nwill see you again soon",

          "transcript": "The man was awakened by a strange\nsinging voice. He opened his eyes and\nfound himself lying in a dilapidated\nwooden hut. At this moment, a line of\nred text appeared in the air. This is an\nabandoned haunted house in the woods.\nPlease walk to the door, mix your blood\nwith the house, and you will become its\nnew owner. But he quickly realized, was\nit a haunted house? He looked down and\nsaw a pair of crimson eyes staring at\nhim from under the bed. Looking up, Fong\nYu saw a pair of bluish gray feet\ndangling above his head. He couldn't\nhelp but take two steps back and bumped\ninto a skeleton. He rushed to the door\nin fear, grabbed the door knob, and his\npalm was pierced by the barbs, drawing\nblood. Congratulations, you have\nsuccessfully inherited this haunted\nhouse and become its new owner. This\nhaunted house will be your strongest\nsupport in this other world. Death means\neternal disappearance. With no return to\nthe original world. In this world, the\nnight is teeming with deadly monsters.\nIt's best to stay indoors. You can\nsearch for food and water, collect wood\nand ore, and may even discover lost\ncivilizations and treasures. Fongu was\ntaken aback. A survival game? He\nfrowned. What could possibly do such a\nthing? Fong Yu glanced around, decided\nnot to delay any longer, rushed to the\ndoor, and grabbed the doororknob. The\ndoor slowly opened. Under the moonlight,\na giant wild boar was fighting a giant\nspider. Both of them had red eyes that\nwere flashing as they stared at Fong Yu.\nThe two monsters turned to look at him.\nFong Yu quickly withdrew his foot and\nslammed the door shut. Leaning against\nthe door, Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s heart pounded.\nAlso, this is a haunted house. By the\nway, the game assistant says he's the\nowner of this haunted house. Yes, you\nare now the owner of the haunted house.\nSince he's the owner, the monsters\ninside shouldn't harm him, right? He\nsaid, \"Since everyone's here, could we\ncome out and talk?\" Shortly after, a red\ndog crawled out from under the bed. Fu\nrecognized it as a corpse dog, its\nmuscles and bones exposed. At this\nmoment, the scattered bones on the\nground began to move and pieced together\na skeleton. A semi-transparent ghost\nfloated down from the roof beam. Fong Yu\ndiscovered it was a beautiful girl in a\nwhite dress. Her semi-transparent body\nmade her look like a ghost. Welcome,\nmaster. Fongu breathed a sigh of relief.\nMy name is Fongu. What's yours,\nValentina? And them? They are Alpha and\nRyan, the ghost replied. Which one is\nAlpha? Fongu asked. Woof. The corpse dog\nresponded immediately upon hearing the\nname. The room was small and the\nfurniture was dilapidated. Several beams\nof the bed were broken. The bedside\ntable was rotten and the floor was full\nof potholes. The only intact piece of\nfurniture was a round table. The chairs\nhad long since turned to wood chips. The\nroof was drafty and moonlight shone\nthrough the holes. Fong Yu Chang smiled\nand said, \"Please take care of me in the\nfuture.\" The corpse dog barked\nexcitedly, the ghost smiled sweetly, and\nthe skeleton bowed respectfully. After\nfamiliarizing himself with the layout of\nthe house, Funu peaked through a crack\nin the wall. The giant wild boar and\nspider outside were gone, but the\nsurroundings were still pitch black. He\nsat down on the bed, the bed frame\ncreaking, but thankfully it didn't\ncollapse. Inside the room, his three\ncompanions watched him silently, the\natmosphere somewhat awkward. Fongu spoke\nup. We don't need to be master and\nservant. How about we help each other\nand become friends. As soon as the words\nwere spoken, the skeleton stood even\nmore upright. The ghost smiled and the\ncorpse dog wagged its tail. The system\nnotification that trust level had\nincreased surprised Fong Yu. \"Then\neveryone, let's rest,\" Fongu said. The\nskeleton sat in the corner, the ghost\nfloated to the roof beam, and the corpse\ndog crawled under the table. After a\nmoment, he suddenly remembered the game\nassistant. Nicholas Xiaolu, I want to\nknow more about this game, Fongu said.\nCommunicate with me directly in your\nmind without speaking. The system will\nrespond. Also, never reveal the system\ninformation to anyone or you will be\nwarned. Funu sighed helplessly as he\nlooked at the interface that appeared,\nwhich had nine options, including\ncharacter attributes, chat channels,\nexchange, and technology tree. He opened\nhis character attributes and glanced at\nhis stats. Intelligence was average,\nstrength was low, agility was slightly\nhigh, and overall his stats were\nreasonable. He then opened the chat\nchannel and found that the world channel\ncould not be opened, and the regional\nchannel was also blank. Out of\ncuriosity, Fongu tried sending a few\nmessages, but no one responded. The\nsystem popped up an explanation saying\nthat other players would have to wait\nuntil the next day to enter. the chosen\none. Fongu was taken aback. Yes, enter\nearly to familiarize yourself with the\nenvironment, the system replied. You\nassign me such a shabby room. Fongu\nthought to himself. But this haunted\nhouse is actually quite something, and\nyour three companions have great\npotential. Really? Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s eyes\nlit up. The system continued. If you\ntrain them, they can completely defeat\nother players and even sweep the world.\nReally? Fong Yu was even more excited,\nbut then he realized, \"These three\ncompanions all seem to be of the dark\nelement. Does that mean I'm going to be\nthe villainous demon king? The use of\nyour power is up to you whether you\nbecome a villainous demon king or a\nsavior,\" the system replied. Fongu\nchecked the technology tree and found\nthat he could repair the wooden house in\nfront of him. \"Prepare requirements:\n0/00 wood, 2020 20th gravel.\" He\nunderstood the next objective to collect\n100 pieces of wood and repair the wooden\nhouse. Upon opening the warehouse, Fun\nYu saw a rusty iron axe. He picked it\nup. It weighed about 10 kg and would\nrequire considerable strength to swing.\nFinally, he checked the crafting list\nand found that he could make torches and\ncampfires, but all other options were\ngrayed out. Late at night, Fong Yu\ntossed and turned, unable to sleep when\nhe was awakened by a system\nnotification. He opened the regional\nchat channel and saw a bunch of panic\nmessages. Wong Fong, ID2516,\nwhere am I? Luda Gueray, ID7,02.\nI just came out of the restroom. How did\nI get here? Fong Yu understood that\nthese players had just entered the game\nand were just as flustered as he was. He\nclosed the chat channel, opened his\nemail, quickly browsed through the\nsystem emails, scrolled to the bottom,\nand clicked done. Three tools fell to\nthe ground. A stone axe, a stone\npickaxe, and a small backpack. Funu\npicked up the tools and prepared to go\noutside to chop down trees. Besides the\nstone axe given to him by the system,\nFong Yu also took the rusty iron axe,\nthen picked up the backpack. You have\nequipped a low-level backpack. Capacity:\n0 out of 10. He looked up, searching for\nthe female ghost, Valentina, but saw\nnothing. Low-level ghosts can only\nappear at night. Sunlight during the day\nwill harm her. Fongu turned to look at\nthe corner of the wall. On the ground\nlay broken bones of a skeleton. Even\nlow-level skeletons can only move at\nnight. Just as he was about to leave,\nthe dog suddenly crawled out from under\nthe table. \"You can be active during the\nday?\" Fongu asked in surprise.\nHellhound, a demonic creature, can be\nactive during the day. Fongu examined\nthe strange dog closely, a sense of\ndoubt creeping into his mind. Why did\nthis demonic creature look like this? He\ndecided to have the dog keep watch.\nAfter all, he still remembered the huge\nwild boar and spider he had seen last\nnight, and it might not be safe during\nthe day either. Fong Yu peered through\nthe crack in the door for a moment and\nafter confirming there was no danger, he\npushed the door open with the dog\nfollowing closely behind. A gentle\nbreeze blew by carrying the scent of\nearth and grass. All around was an open\nspace beyond which stood towering trees.\nHe threw down the stone axe, picked up\nthe iron axe, and asked the game\nassistant, \"Is chopping trees with the\niron axe more efficient than with the\nstone axe?\" The assistant replied, \"Yes,\nthe iron ax's chopping efficiency is\n200% that of the stone axe.\" 10 minutes\nlater, a crisp snapping sound rang out,\nand the tree trunk broke into several\npieces, falling to the ground. Fongu\nraised an eyebrow and saw a note appear\nin the air. The game systems simplifies\nthe learning curve for new players. Feld\ntrees, mined ore, and killed animals\nwill automatically decompose. Funu\nsmiled. The systems help saved him\neffort. Although it deducted some\nresources, it was still much easier than\ndismantling it himself. Upon reaching\nthe wooden stake, Funu confirmed that he\nhad picked it up and received 10 pieces\nof wood. You have obtained 10 pieces of\nwood. He only needed to cut down nine\nmore trees to finish building the cabin.\nSo, he started felling trees again. An\nhour later, Funu had chopped down five\ntrees and felt almost completely\nexhausted. He needed to find something\nto eat. At this moment, the game\nassistant notified him. Your hunger\nlevel is below 10% and your stamina has\ndecreased by 30%. Please find food as\nsoon as possible. He looked around, then\nwalked to the tree and saw a cluster of\nred mushrooms. A system notification\nappeared. Red umbrella mushrooms can\ncause hallucinations when eaten alone.\nOnly when cooked with meat can the\ntoxins be eliminated. Fongu decided to\npick the mushroom. It wasn't highly\npoisonous, so he could tolerate it.\nAfter picking the mushroom, he continued\nsearching for others. Suddenly, he\nrealized Alpha was gone. Just as he was\nwondering what was going on, the bushes\nmoved, and Alpha emerged, carrying a\nrabbit in its mouth. Alpha can hunt.\nIsn't it lame? The dog put the rabbit on\nthe ground and wagged its tail,\nseemingly wanting to show off. Fongu\npatted Alpha's head. Well done. He\ndiscovered that the rabbit wasn't dead,\nbut was terrified and its body was\nconvulsing. Adult gray rabbit can be\nraised in captivity. Slaughtering it\nwill yield rabbit meat, rabbit fur, and\nanimal hide. Slaughter or not? Fongu\nclicked slaughter without hesitation. A\nflash of blood appeared on the rabbit's\nbody, and the system notification\nindicated that the following items had\nbeen added to the inventory. received\ntwo rabbit meat, one rabbit fur, one\nanimal hide. Inventory capacity 5 tents.\nGreat. Finally, some meat. Rabbit fur\ncan be used to make quilts, blankets,\nand winter clothing. This is useful.\nAnimal hide can be used to decorate\nrooms, make beds, and upgrade backpacks.\nUpgrade backpack. Great. Fa was\npreparing to cook food, but he needed a\ncampfire. He checked the crafting\noptions and saw that a campfire could be\nmade. Campfire crafting 10 of five wood\ncan be crafted. He clicked create and a\nphantom image appeared before him.\nSelecting to place a campfire at the\nentrance. After setting up the campfire,\nFongu prepared to roast rabbit meat, but\nthe system prompted, \"Please light the\ncampfire.\" The problem of starting a\nfire was giving Fongu a headache, but he\nthought of flint and steel. He opened\nthe exchange, searched for flint and\nsteel, and found a seller. Seller Lie\nMing ID 8586\nconsignment item flint and steel pair\nexchange item, one bucket of water, one\npiece of meat, or five pieces of wood.\nFunu clicked the trade button only to be\ntold that the item was already sold. He\nhad no choice but to keep refreshing the\npage until new flint and steel became\navailable, at which point he exchanged\nfive pieces of wood for a pair. Funu lit\nthe campfire, preparing to roast the\nrabbit. A lit campfire. One piece of\nwood can burn for 2 hours, one branch\nfor 15 minutes. He gathered some\nbranches, skewered the rabbit meat, and\nstarted roasting it. Rabbit meat being\ncooked. Estimated cooking time 15\nminutes 2 seconds. The rabbit meat\nslowly changed color under the flames,\nreleasing an irresistible aroma. Fong\nYu&lt;unk&gt;s mouth began to water, and Alfa\nalso stared intently at the roasted\nmeat. \"Don't worry, you caught the\nrabbit, so we'll split it in half,\" Fong\nYu said with a smile. This was his first\nmeal in the game. \"Woof!\" Alfa responded\nhappily, and Fong Yu knew that he would\nhave to find a way to ensure the food\nsupply next. While the rabbit was\nroasting, Fun Yu opened the system\ninterface and checked the regional chat\nchannel. Lee Ching Xi ID 4091 brothers,\nI've collected 20 units of wood to build\na log cabin. Lieong ID 212. I have 40\nunits, but I'm incredibly thirsty. Is\nthere any water? Ton Jong ID7171.\nThere's a stream next to me. The water\nis quite clean and there are fish.\nSonging ID 3533. Just a reminder, you\ncan't drink tap water. Boil it before\ndrinking, otherwise you might get\npoisoned. Tion Ji Kong ID7171.\nI just drank a lot. Tion Kong ID7171.\nDamn, my stomach is starting to hurt.\nSeeing this, Fong Yu understood a few\nthings. He had a wooden house at his\nspawn point. While other players had to\nstart from scratch, and raw water\ncouldn't be drunk directly as it could\nbe fatal. He decided to replenish his\nfluids with berries to avoid the risks\nassociated with drinking tap water. He\ncontinued watching the chat. The rabbit\nmeat was finally cooked. Roasted rabbit\nmeat. Consuming this increases hunger by\n80 points. Fongu checked his status.\nPlayer status. Stamina 30 out of 100.\nSpirit 90 to 100. Hunger 5 out of 100.\nThirst 30 out of 100. It turns out that\nhunger and thirst affect physical\nstrength and low levels can lead to\ndeath. He started eating roasted rabbit\nmeat and also tore off a piece for the\ndog. The rabbit meat tasted great. The\ndog ate it even more happily. Alfa's\ntrust in you plus 10. Current trust 50.\nAfter eating the rabbit meat, Fong Yu's\nhunger level rose to 55 out of 100. His\nthirst level dropped to 20 out of 100,\nand his stamina recovered to 46 out of\n100. The game assistant explained the\nimportance of mental stats. Mental stats\ndetermine action efficiency and the\nperception of surrounding danger. Below\na certain value can lead to\nhallucinations or even suicide. So this\nis how important mental energy is\nespecially for survival. Fongu roasted\nthe red mushrooms and after seeing its\nnotification a thought struck him.\nRoasted red mushrooms. Delicious flavor,\nmild neurotoxin, reduces sanity by 20,\nand increases hunger by 15. Mushrooms\nlower sanity, so they don't look like\nthey're safe to eat. At that moment, a\nsystem notification popped up. The aroma\nof roasted red mushrooms is attractive\nto wild boores. Thinking of the wild\nboar he had seen last night, Fong Yu\ndecided to collect the mushrooms. After\nroasting the rabbit, he felt his\nstrength and energy had recovered\nconsiderably. He looked at the dog and\ntentatively said, \"Alpha, are there any\nmore rabbits around? Let's catch a few\nmore.\" The dog obediently ran into the\nwoods. However, after a while, the dog\nstill hadn't returned, so Fong Yu\ndecided to go look for it. At that\nmoment, Alpha emerged from the bushes, a\nbrightly colored pheasant in its beak.\nAlpha placed the pheasant in front of\nFong Yu, wagging its tail and asking for\na reward. So capable. Here, eat. Fong Yu\nsmiled and gave the last piece of rabbit\nmeat to the dog. Alpha swallowed the\nrabbit meat hole. Adult feeasant can be\nfarmed and slaughtered. Fongu glanced at\nthe pheasant and chose to slaughter it.\nAnother flash of blood and the feeasant\nvanished, leaving behind chicken meat\nand feathers. Funu skewered the chicken\nmeat with a twig and continued grilling.\nAlthough he was full, it was still\nnecessary to prepare for the next meal\nin advance, especially since the\ncampfire was still burning. He needed to\ntrade the remaining chicken for some\nberries. Funu listed 10 berries for half\na chicken on the exchange, setting a\nhigh price arbitrarily. Soon, the system\nnotified him that the transaction was\ncomplete, and he received 10 berries. He\ntook out the berry and noticed it was\nsmall and green. Green plum berry tastes\nslightly sweet and astringent,\nnon-toxic, increases hunger and thirst\nby 10 when consumed. A piece of roasted\nchicken can add 80 hunger points, and 10\nberries can add 100 hunger points and\nhydration points. It's a great deal.\nFongu tried one berry. It tasted pretty\ngood. He then showed another one to\nAlpha. Want some? Alpha glanced at it,\nshook its head, and lay back down. Fong\nYu ate three berries and felt his thirst\nwas relieved. With food and water\nsecured, he packed the roasted chicken\nand the remaining berries into his\nbackpack and prepared to continue\ncutting down trees. Today's goal is 100\npieces of wood. I chopped down six trees\nand already have 60 pieces of wood. I\nused 10 pieces of wood to exchange for a\nflint and steel, and I still have 50\npieces in my inventory. Only five trees\nremained to reach the target. With his\niron axe and tree chopping skills, Fong\nYu quickly chopped down all five trees\nand even collected branches to ensure no\nmaterials were wasted. At noon, Alpha\nbrought back three more rabbits and one\npheasant. Without it, Fongu wouldn't\nhave been able to chop enough wood to\nreach 100 pieces so quickly. With food\nshortages and high meat prices, Fong Yu\nlisted the meat in his backpack on the\nstock exchange, setting a high price.\nWith 100 pieces of wood, Fong Yu\nreturned to the cabin and opened the\ntech tree interface. Haunted house in\nthe woods. Dilapidated repair\nrequirements. Would 100 gravel 2020\nrepair or not? Finally, the cabin could\nbe repaired. Fongu excitedly selected\nthe repair option. The cabin began to\nshake. The damaged planks disappeared\nautomatically and new planks were\ninstalled in their place. In less than a\nminute, the cabin was completely\ntransformed. Cabin repair complete.\nGhost Valentina's trust level plus 20,\ncurrent trust level 55. Skeleton lion's\ntrust plus 30, current trust 68. Corpse\ndog Alpha's trust plus 40, current trust\n90. Repairing the cabin greatly\nincreased the trust level with your\ncompanions. Unlocks the fireplace and\ncrafting table. Fongu looked at the\nbedside and sure enough there was a\nfireplace made of stones and a crafting\ntable next to it. Fireplace can be used\nto heat a room or for cooking. Crafting\ntable. Use this table to craft small\nitems. Large items require unlocking the\ncrafting workshop. Fongu nodded in\nsatisfaction. Now that there was a\nfireplace, the temperature in the room\nwas guaranteed and at least they\nwouldn't have to suffer from the cold\nanymore. He also planned to improve his\nbed. The system suggested that he could\nuse dry grass to make the bed while he\ncould keep the animal hides to upgrade\nhis backpack. Fong Yu walked to the\ncrafting table intending to make a pot\nto boil water. Ceramic pot clay 0 to2\nrotan 0 to1 cannot be crafted. Iron pot\n0/3 iron ingots requires a forging\nfurnace cannot be manufactured due to\nlack of materials. The pot cannot be\nmanufactured at this time. Forge\nunlocked by upgrading the haunted woods\nhouse into a sturdy woods cabin. Forest\nhaunted house upgrade. Sturdy forest\nhaunted house upgrade requirements. Wood\n0/200\ngravel 0/00\nvines 0/50 cannot be crafted. In the\nafternoon, Fong Yu cleared away the\nwithered grass outside the house,\nspreading most of it on the bedboard,\nusing a small portion to make a nest for\nAlpha and leaving the rest at the\nexchange. Upon seeing the grassy nest,\nAlpha the dog rolled around happily,\nappearing extremely joyful. Alpha's\ntrust level plus 10, current trust level\n100. Alpha the corpse dog has reached\n100% trust in you. It considers you a\nfriend and will actively protect you in\ntimes of danger. After finishing all\nthat, Fongu lay down on the bed to rest\nand recover his strength. He hadn't been\nasleep long when he was awakened by a\nsystem notification. Upon opening the\nsystem interface, he saw that someone\nhadn't mentioned him in the regional\nchat channel. The regional chat channel\nwas bustling with activity. Liin Long\nID212. Holy crap, he's actually selling\nmeat. Wu Jingia ID 757. Huh? Selling\nmeat? How? Songing ID 3533. Lie long\nID212. Please be clear. What kind of\nmeat are you selling? Lie and long\nID212. Of course, it's meat for eating.\nWhat are you guys thinking? Ming Xang\nID211. He actually sold eight pieces of\nmeat. Two pieces of chicken and six\npieces of rabbit. I only got two pieces\nof meat from a pheasant I caught. and he\nactually managed to catch a rabbit.\nThat's amazing. Seeing this, Fongu was\nstunned. He hadn't expected that the\nmeat he had listed on the exchange would\nattract so much attention. He wasn't in\nthe mood to deal with these people, so\nhe simply closed the regional chat\nchannel and got to work. The system\npopped up another notification. Your\nconsigned chicken has been successfully\nsold. You have received 20 green\nplumber. Fong Yu opened the exchange and\nsaw that his chicken had been bought by\nXiao Yini. He happily read the buyer's\nmessage. Xiao Yini ID909.\nHey bro, can you tell me how to find so\nmuch me? It's a bit pricey. Could you\ngive me a discount? Fu decided to adjust\nthe price to seven berries per piece and\nreplied, \"Seven berries? That's the\nlowest I can go. You can buy it anytime\nyou need it.\" Fongu adjusted the price\nof the remaining rabbit meat and\naccepted an exchange of 20 units of\ngravel or 15 units of vines. There are\nonly trees around the wooden house.\nAlthough there are some red umbrella\nmushrooms, they are poisonous and cannot\nbe sold. There may be other supplies in\nthe woods, but without armor and\nweapons, one can only run away if\nencountering wild beasts. After spending\nthe afternoon cutting down 10 trees\nbefore dark, Fongu obtained 100 pieces\nof wood and nearly a thousand branches\nand also picked dozens of red mushrooms.\nHis arms were already sore and his palms\nwere blistered from the iron axe, so he\ndecided to pack up his supplies and go\nback into the house to try out the\nfireplace for dinner. While grilling the\nmeat, Fongu checked his consigned meat\nand found that it had all been sold,\nearning him 80 units of gravel and 30\nunits of vines. Funu glanced at the chat\nchannel and saw that almost all the\nplayers had completed the construction\nof the wooden hut and campfire. Those\nwho hadn't finished had basically no\nchance to speak. After finishing dinner,\nFongu fed the dog, ate his own meal,\nlaid down on the bed, and quickly fell\ninto a deep sleep. At night, Fongu slept\nsoundly, his corpse dog, Alfa, nestled\nin the hay beside him. The campfire in\nthe fireplace still burned. On the roof\nbeam, the ghost Valentina quietly\nwatched the sleeping Fong Yu, lost in\nthought. Not far away, skeleton Ryan\nslowly stood up, walked to the bedside,\nand picked up the iron ax that Fongu had\nplaced beside him. Roar! Alfa growled\nwearily, and leaped out. The skeleton\nshrugged and took a step back. The ghost\nsmiled. \"He is, after all, our master.\nWe still need him to get us out of this\npredicament.\" The skeleton, iron axe in\nhand, turned and walked to the door,\nthen pushed it open. Alpha seeing this\nretreated back to its grassy nest. The\nnext morning, the first thing Fong Yu\ndid after waking up was to check the\nregional chat channel. He discovered\nthat the number of people in the channel\nhad dropped from 10,000 yesterday to\n9,255,\nmeaning that 745 players failed to\nsurvive the first night. Fong Yu felt a\npang of melancholy. Who could guarantee\nthey would live forever? He glanced at\nthe other players comments. Some people\nhave been discussing their terrifying\nexperience last night, while others have\nspeculated that the game might be\nrelated to aliens. Just as Fongu\ncontinued browsing, the system suddenly\nissued a new notification.\nCongratulations on successfully passing\nthe first day. You have gained the\nqualification to survive in this world.\nOver the next 3 days, temperatures will\ndrop rapidly below zero, and winter will\narrive in the night of 3 days from now.\nPlease upgrade your shed to a cabin as\nsoon as possible. The cabin will\neffectively protect you from the cold\nwind and snow, and the fireplace will\nprovide you with warmth. Friendly\nreminder, remember to stock up on food\nand warm clothing as winter will be very\ncold. Please be prepared. The cabin is\nfinished and today we're working hard to\nupgrade it into a sturdy cabin that can\ndefend against wild animals. There's a\nfireplace inside, so heating isn't a\nproblem, and there's enough food, but\nthe bed is very uncomfortable. The\nmaterials for the quilt can be purchased\nfrom the exchange, making the winter\nchallenge easy for him. Compared to\nother players, he doesn't need to worry\nabout wood and food. He has enough\nresources. He walked to the bedside and\nsaw his dog, Alpha, sitting there\nwagging its tail, so he decided to make\nit some roast meat. He opened his\nbackpack only to find that the meat was\ngone. Remembering that he had listed the\nmeat on the exchange and thankfully no\none bought it, he took two pieces of\nmeat from the exchange and put them in\nthe fireplace to roast. After finishing\nthe roasting, Funu prepared to continue\nchopping wood, only to find that his\nrusty iron axe was missing. Turning\naround, he saw it lying next to the\nskeleton Ryan's bones. What was it doing\nwith the axe last night? Fun wondered.\nJust then, Alfa ran to the gate and\ncalled to Fong Yu, seemingly beckoning\nhim over. Fong Yu walked to the door,\npushed it open, and froze. In the\nsunlight, there were at least 200 neatly\nstacked logs. Fong Yu looked at the iron\naxe in his hand, then at the scattered\nskeleton. Ryan, thanks, buddy. Fong Yu\nput away the wood and opened the\ntechnology tree to check the upgrade\nrequirements. with 300/200\ngravel 80 out of 100 vines 3050ths\ncannot upgrade. He was running low on\nmaterials. He prepared to go out again\nto gather more supplies. As he picked up\nthe iron axe, a system notification\nappeared. Your backpack is full. You can\nupgrade your backpack at the crafting\ntable. Fongu walked to the crafting\ntable and check the upgrade options.\nUpgrade requirements for basic backpack\nto intermediate backpack for fifths\nanimal hide 0/2 linen. We don't have\nenough materials. Fongu shook his head\nand decided to store the unused items in\nthe warehouse first. After packing his\nbackpack, Fongu led Alfa out of the\nhouse. Today, he wouldn't be logging\nanymore because he already had enough\ntimber. He needed animal hides, flax,\ngravel, and rot tan. Although he could\nbuy them at the exchange, he decided to\nfind them himself. After entering the\nforest, Fong Yu did not encounter any\nwild beasts. There was nothing around\nhim except trees, vines, and dead\nleaves. He cautiously told Alpha, \"If\nyou spot any animals or wild beasts,\nremember to alert me.\" \"Woof.\" Alpha\nresponded, leading Fong Yu on his\nexploration. Fong Yu began cutting vines\nfrom the trees, essential materials for\nrepairing the cabin. A dozen minutes\nlater, Fong Yu had collected 20 vines\nand Alpha had brought back a pheasant.\nThe two returned to the house to prepare\nroasted chicken for breakfast. After\neating, Fong Yu led Alpha back into the\nforest, this time intending to venture\ndeeper into the woods. After walking\nabout 100 m, Alpha suddenly stopped and\ngrowled at a bush. Woof! The bushes\nbegan to rustle. Fong Yu gripped his\niron ax tightly, watching it wearily. A\nmoment later, a brown wild boar poked\nits head out of the bushes, its mouth\nrevealing curved tusks. Juvenile wild\nboores are potentially aggressive. We\nrecommend preparing weapons and armor.\nThe system message reads, \"The wild boar\nlet out a cry and charged straight at\nFong Yu, who quickly hid behind a nearby\ntree, avoiding the collision. Alpha,\nhelp!\" Fongu shouted, quickly preparing\nto respond. Alpha bit the wild boar's\nrump and the boar frantically struggled\nto shake it off. Seeing the wild boar\nbeing restrained by the dog, Fongu\nquickly raised his iron ax and smashed\nit down. Thump. The axe struck the wild\nboar's head, leaving a deep dent. The\nboar cried out in pain and began to\nstruggle desperately. Alpha remained\nfirmly pinned down on the wild boar, and\nFun Yu seized the opportunity to raise\nhis ax again, this time aiming for its\nhead. With that, the axe struck the wild\nboar squarely in the forehead,\nsplattering blood and sweat everywhere,\nand the boar finally collapsed and died.\nFunu breathed a sigh of relief and sat\ndown on the ground, panting. \"Alpha,\nthanks.\" Funu patted the dog's head.\nJust as he was about to encourage the\ndog, Alpha suddenly turned its head and\nbarked at the bushes again. The bushes\nbegan to sway again, and then a huge\nadult wild boar emerged from them. This\nboar was enormous with tusks nearly half\na meter long. Adult wild boores. They\nare huge with thick skin and tough\nflesh, making them a nightmare for\nnovice players. Never let them charge at\nyou or you'll die. Fongu looked at the\nadult wild boar, his heart tightening as\nhe realized he had just killed a\njuvenile. Damn it. Chapter 12. The\nwooden treasure chest in the pigsty.\nSeeing the adult wild boar charging\ntowards him, Fong Yu immediately shouted\nto Alpha, \"Run!\" He then quickly hid\nbehind a tree, the boar abruptly turned\nand charged at him again. Fongu knew he\ncouldn't outrun the giant wild boar. His\nonly option was to find shelter, so he\nquickly climbed a nearby tree, grabbing\nonto vines and climbing upwards. The\nwild boar rammed into the tree trunk\nwith a loud crash. Alpha tried to\nattract the boar's attention, but the\nboar ignored him and continued ramming\nthe trunk. Cracks began to appear in the\ntrunk. Clearly, the boar was preparing\nto break the tree. Fongu knew that a\ndirect confrontation wouldn't work. He\nhad to outsmart them. He suddenly\nremembered that wild boar seemed\ninterested in roasted red mushrooms, so\nhe took some roasted mushrooms from his\nbackpack and threw them down. Then, he\nthrew down all the red mushrooms he had\ncollected along the way. Smelling the\naroma, the wild boar immediately\nabandoned Fong Yu under the tree and\nbegan to nibble on the mushrooms. Once\nhe was sure the wild boar's attention\nwas completely drawn, Fun Yu quietly\nclimbed down the tree, pulled out his\niron axe, and automatically collected\nthe spoils from the nearby wild boar\ncubs, received 20 wild boar meat, two\npig skins, and five pig bones. Fong Yu\nstared at the wild boar eating\nmushrooms, hesitating. Should he launch\na sneak attack or flee? However, he\npatiently waited for the right\nopportunity. Soon, the wild boar began\nto roll around in pain after eating the\nmushrooms, clearly affected by their\nhallucinogenic effects. Fong Yu seized\nthe opportunity and commanded Alpha to\nattack the boar. The wild boar didn't\nreact at all, still rolling around. Fong\nYu smiled, took the iron axe, and walked\ntowards the wild boar and swung the\nfirst ax blow without hesitation. tear.\nThe ax blade only sliced through the\nthick mane, but it wasn't a fatal blow.\nFong Yu swung the axe a second and a\nthird time. Finally, after five blows,\nthe artery in the wild boar's neck was\nsevered, blood spurted out, and the wild\nboar died. Obtained 40 wild boar meat\nfor pig skins, 10 pig bones, and two\nsharp tusks. Fongu inspected his spoils\nand smiled with satisfaction. 60 pieces\nof meat were equivalent to 600 pieces of\nwood. A huge profit. He saw the uses for\nthe pigkin, bones, and tusks, and\nplanned to use these materials to make a\nnew backpack and protective gear.\nAfterward, he prepared to return to the\ncabin to clean the blood off his body.\nHowever, just as he was about to leave,\nAlfa ran into the bushes, and Fongu\nquickly followed. Soon after, they came\nto a large tree with a hole in the\ntrunk. A soft whimpering sound came from\ninside and Fongu could see a litter of\npiglets through the opening. Alpha\njumped into the hole, not to pay\nattention to the piglets, but to start\nrumaging through the hay. Soon the hay\nstack was lifted, revealing a wooden\nbox. Wooden treasure chest has a chance\nto contain green or lower quality items\nand blueprints. Fongu walked over and\nopened the treasure chest. Inside was a\npiece of paper and some granules.\nobtained wild boar armor crafting\nblueprint available for learning. Fong\nYu happily studied the blueprints and\nsuddenly a method for crafting wild boar\narmor appeared in his mind. Then he\ndiscovered wheat and pumpkin seeds.\nReceived five wheat seeds, five pumpkin\nseeds. These seeds are very important to\nthe survivors as they can grow flour and\npumpkins which can be made into pumpkin\npancakes, his favorite snack. Just as he\nwas celebrating his harvest, he suddenly\nheard the roars of several wild boores\noutside. Clearly, a herd of wild boars\nhad arrived. Fong Yu immediately\nsummoned Alpha and quickly ran out of\nthe tree hollow, fleeing towards the\nwooden house. Chapter 13. Crafting the\nwild boar suit, upgrading the haunted\nhouse to escape the herd of wild boars.\nFong Yu and Alpha quickly ran out of the\nwoods and back to the cabin. Few finally\nsafe, Fongu breathed a sigh of relief.\nToday's adventure was fraught with\ndanger. He was almost killed by a wild\nboar. Although it was thrilling, the\ngains were plentiful. 60 pieces of wild\nboar meat, solving the problem of food\nand clothing. Discovering the method of\nmaking pigkin armor and finding wheat\nand pumpkin seeds, securing a stable\nfood source. After resting for a while,\nFunu went to the crafting table to check\nthe armor crafting options. The crafting\ntable can craft items of white quality\nor lower. Items of green quality or\nhigher require a crafting blueprint.\nFongu saw the system notification and\nrealized that all items had grades\nranging from junk to artifacts. Wild\nboar suit. Green learned. Excellent\nquality armor. Pretty good. He looked at\nthe set attributes. Wild boar set. When\nequipped, wild boars will not attack and\nwill be considered allies. Fongu sighed\nhelplessly being treated as a companion\nby wild boores. This attribute is too\nbizarre. However, he realized that this\nset of armor would make him safer to\nsurvive among wild boar herds and even\nmake hunting easier. To make armor, he\nneeded flax. So, Fongu opened the\nexchange and traded wild boar meat for\nthe flax he needed. After acquiring all\nthe flax, he began crafting. But when he\ngot to the wild boar boots, he\ndiscovered he was missing a wild boar\nhide. Fongu realized with dismay that he\nmight be the first player to hunt wild\nboar. Crafting station. Wild boar armor\nis being crafted. Estimated time 49\nminutes 45 seconds. While waiting, Fongu\nused three pieces of meat to exchange\nfor the remaining materials needed to\nupgrade the wooden house and also\ngathered other supplies. Next, Fongu\nclicked on the tech tree and upgraded\nthe wooden house. The wooden house\nvibrated for a minute. After the upgrade\nwas completed, he saw that the walls\nwere thicker. The interior area expanded\nfrom 20 square m to 30 m, and a\npartition wall and wooden door were\nadded between the bedroom and the living\nroom, making the whole house look more\nsturdy. Ghost Valentina's trust plus 20\ncurrent trust. 75. Skeleton Ryan's trust\nplus 30, current trust 98. Corpse Dog\nAlpha's trust plus 40, current trust\n140. Fong was pleased with the increase\nin trust, especially since Ryan's trust\nlevel was nearing its maximum, and he\nhoped that Ryan could also become his\npartner. After upgrading the cabin, Fong\nYu checked the requirements for the next\nstage of upgrades. Sturdy forest haunted\nhouse, one bedroom, one living room,\n30sqm. Spacious forest haunted house one\nbedroom one living room 40s sqm upgrade\nrequirements wood 9500\ngravel 0/200\nmud 0/100\nvine 0/100\nthe material requirements have doubled\nFongu frowned but he was still looking\nforward to unlocking the kitchen and\ntoilet we need to upgrade the kitchen\nand toilet as soon as possible he plans\nto speed up the upgrade of the log cabin\nchapter 14. The advantages of using your\nbrain. After tidying up the room, Fun Yu\nopened the exchange to browse. He wanted\nto find some good items and also\nwondered if he could make some money\nfrom the price difference. Currently,\nthe exchange rate at the exchange is one\npiece of meat for 20 pieces of wood and\none berry for four pieces of wood. The\nprices of both meat and berries have\nincreased. Funu understood the reason.\nWood is easy to obtain. You can get it\nby cutting down a few trees. Meat, on\nthe other hand, requires hunting, which\nis much more difficult. Berries not only\nfill the stomach, but also replenish\nwater. And since many people lack water\nsources, berries have also become\nvaluable. Fongu figured that the meat he\nhad saved had increased in price, and he\ncould use it to exchange for more\nresources. So, he listed 50 pieces of\nmeat on the exchange, exchanging them\nfor gravel and mud, keeping a few pieces\nof meat for sustenance. After doing all\nthat, he opened the chat channel to see\nhow other players were doing. Lie Chong\nLeong ID 888. How was everyone's day? Wu\nJingia ID 757. I upgraded the wooden\nshed into a small wooden house. I should\nbe the fastest to upgrade a wooden\nhouse, right? Songing ID 3533. I've\ncollected 180 wood and I'm still 20\nshort. Lie Chun Long ID 212. I also\nupgraded my wooden house. Next, I need\nto stock up on food and warm supplies.\nLeong Ping ID 5566. I only have 120\npieces of wood saved up. Seeing this,\nFong Yu secretly rejoiced that the flint\nand steel he bought was cheap, costing\nonly five pieces of wood, while some\npeople had spent 30 pieces of wood.\nFongu remained silent to avoid arousing\njealousy. Through chatting, Fongu could\nsee the differences between players.\nEspecially as time went on, the gap\nwould widen. He noticed that the number\nof players had dropped from over 9,000\nto 9,100,\nmeaning that many players had died. Funu\nunderstood that many people were\nunfamiliar with the environment and were\nlikely to encounter danger if they dared\nto explore. Even he himself had almost\ndied at the hands of wild boars. Fongu\nbegan crafting the wild boar armor.\nAfter finishing it, he found that the\ndark brown leather armor wasn't very\nattractive, but it was extremely\npractical. Wearing it, he felt more\nconfident and prepared to go out and\nexplore further, hoping to find another\ntreasure chest. Cutting down trees is\ninefficient, so he prefers hunting wild\nboores. Each juvenile wild boar he kills\ncan be exchanged for 400 pieces of wood,\nwhich is equivalent to 40 trees, and it\nwould take two or 3 days to cut down 40\ntrees. He thought those with brains have\nan advantage over those who only know\nhow to exert their strength. Funu\ndecided to explore the east. The woods\nto the west were wild boar territory and\nhe didn't have complete protective gear\nat the moment. So venturing in rashly\nwould be too dangerous. Alpha followed\nhim and Fong Yu discovered that it was\nvery intelligent, managing to find the\nwild boar's den and even discover a\nwooden treasure chest inside. Alpha, can\nyou sense the location of the treasure\nchest? Funu asked. Woof. The dog nodded.\nFunu smiled happily. The dog with its\nown treasure chest navigation was\npractically a cheat code. He decided to\nhave Alpha take him to find more\ntreasure chests and exchanged the good\nstuff inside for resources. This was\nmuch less effort than chopping down\ntrees. So, Fongu led Alpha toward the\nwoods to the east. Chapter 15. Eastern\nspider forest. Fong Yu and Alpha entered\nthe woods to the east with Alpha leading\nthe way and Fong Yu following closely\nbehind. Alpha, slow down. Fong Yu\nshouted, \"Be careful.\" Despite the\nwarning, Fong Yu still followed closely.\nHe trusted that Alpha, as a native,\ncould sense danger, and with the dog by\nhis side, he wasn't too worried.\nHowever, as they ventured deeper into\nthe woods, Fong Yu discovered that the\nsurrounding trees were covered with\nenormous spiderw webs, each containing\none or two black hairy spiders of\nvarying sizes, ranging from the size of\na palm to the size of a watermelon. Fong\nYu couldn't help but swallow hard. He\nwas naturally afraid of hairy insects,\nespecially when he saw these spiders, so\nhe stopped in his tracks. Alpha seemed\nto realize Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s hesitation,\nstopped, looked back at him, and wagged\nits tail as if encouraging him to\ncontinue. Fong Yu took a deep breath,\nsuppressing his fear, and thought of a\nsolution: fire. Insects should all be\nafraid of fire. So, they returned to the\ncabin to make torches. Sticks were easy\nto obtain. One piece of wood could make\neight sticks, but they needed charcoal\nto make torches. Fong Yu found four\npieces of charcoal in the fireplace and\ncalculated that this meant only half of\nevery eight pieces of wood would produce\ncharcoal. Back at the workbench, Fongu\nmade four torches from charcoal and\nsticks in less than a minute. Torch\nburns for 30 minutes, illuminating a\nradius of 10 m. Fongu put the three\ntorches into his backpack, lit one, and\nled Alpha back to the eastern woods,\nheading towards the area covered in\nspiderw webs. Upon seeing the fire\nlight, the spiders scattered in all\ndirections. It worked. Fongu breathed a\nsigh of relief. Just as he was about to\nuse a torch to light the spiderweb, a\nsystem notification appeared. Spiderweb\ncan be used to make clothing, furniture,\nand traps. Do you want to collect it?\nFong was stunned. These spiderw webs\ncould be used as materials. He began\ncollecting large areas of spiderw webs,\nbut found that only about one square\nmeter of spiderw webs could be\ncollected. Soon, he cleared a path\nleading into the depths of the forest.\nAs he went on, Fongu noticed that the\nspiders around him were getting bigger\nand bigger, the largest of which was\nalmost the size of a millstone. After\nwalking a few more steps, Fong Yu\ndiscovered a giant spiderweb that\nstretched across almost four large trees\nwith a white oval-shaped cocoon hanging\nin the center. \"This must be a spider's\nnest,\" Fongu's heart tightened. The\nsystem prompted again. \"Basic spider\nnest produces ordinary spiders daily.\nUpgrades upon reaching a certain size.\nWeakness, vulnerable to fire, dismantles\nto obtain a large amount of spider web.\"\nJust as Fong Yu was staring at the giant\ncocoon, a huge spider crawled out of its\nnest. Its back was covered with golden\npatterns. And most strangely, its\nabdomen had a human face on it.\nHumanfaced spider, a variant of spider,\nhighly venomous with a very high chance\nof dropping rare items upon defeat. A\nrare item. A hint of interest flashed in\nFong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s eyes. Suddenly, the\nhuman-faced spider shook its rear end,\nand a white ball flew towards Fong Yu.\nWith a sizzle, the white substance\nstruck Fong Yu's torch, quickly\nextinguishing the flame. Holy crap, it\ncan attack from a distance. Fongu was\nshocked and quickly retreated. After the\ntorches lost their light, spiders began\nto slowly crawl out of the shadows, and\nthe situation became dangerous. The\nhuman-faced spider swung its rear end\nagain, and Fong Yu quickly picked up the\nremaining torches and moved to avoid the\nattack. He quickly rekindled the torch,\nand at that moment, Alpha seized the\nopportunity to pounce on the human-faced\nspider. The spider seemed to sense the\ndemonic bloodline within Alpha, let out\na hiss, and swiftly retreated back to\nits lair. Upon hearing the cries of the\nhuman-faced spider, the surrounding\nspiders were no longer afraid of the\nfire light and began to swarm around\nFong Yu and Alpha. The situation was\nbecoming increasingly dangerous, and\nFong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s heart tightened. Suddenly,\nhe remembered, \"Spider nests are afraid\nof fire.\" Without hesitation, he threw\nthe torch fiercely at the giant spider\nnest. Chapter 16. Two treasure chests in\nthe spider's nest. Fun Yu threw a\nburning torch which flew towards the\nspider's nest. The human-faced spider\nsensed the danger and tried to knock the\ntorch down with its silk, but the\nentrance to the cave was too narrow and\nthe torch landed on the nest. Sparks\ntouched the silk and the flames spread\nrapidly. The human-faced spider hissed\nfrantically, and the other spiders tried\nto extinguish the flames, but they\nthemselves were engulfed in fire.\nFinally, the human-faced spider led the\nremaining spiders into the forest. Fong\nYu knew he had offended this powerful\nenemy. The fire quickly engulfed the\nspider nest and spread to the\nsurrounding trees. A foul stench filled\nthe air. Fongu was extremely anxious\nbecause the cabin was also in the woods\nand the fire could spread there. Just as\nhe was getting anxious, one of the four\ngiant trees surrounding the spider's\nnest suddenly trembled and creaked. A\nhuge tree trunk emerged from the canopy\nand slammed into the flames. The flames\nquickly went out and the giant tree\nreturned to normal. The forest possesses\nits own will. When it faces a crisis,\nthe trance will appear and eliminate it.\nFongu was shocked by the existence of\nthe tree people. He originally thought\nthat the giant beasts were already\ndangerous, but the tree people were\nobviously much more powerful. As the\nsmoke cleared, Alpha rushed into the\nspider's nest ruins and dug out a wooden\ntreasure chest. Then it dragged a bronze\ntreasure chest from the ruins. Bronze\nchest can contain rare and lower rarity\nitems, blueprints. Funu excitedly opened\nthe wooden treasure chest. Inside were\nitems related to spiders. Received eight\nspiderw webs, 15 spider glands, 20\nspider fangs. Spider glands can be used\nto make healing ointments or antidotes.\nSpider fangs can be used to craft\nparalysis traps, fong clubs, and poison\narrows. These items were related to\nspiders, making Fong You realize that\nthe contents of the treasure chest were\nconnected to the surrounding\nenvironment. So he turned around and\nopened the bronze treasure chest.\nReceived 15 spiderw webs, one mutant\nspider egg, mutant spider eggs. Funu was\nstunned. Mutant spider egg. Drip your\nown blood onto the spider egg and a\nmutated spider baby will hatch and grow\ninto a top tier pet. Fongu sighed\nhelplessly. A spider is fine. It's\nalready been opened anyway. But his\nbackpack was already full and he\ncouldn't take any more spider eggs, so\nhe carried the spider eggs with him as\nhe prepared to return. Just then, Alpha\nsuddenly barked wildly. Before Fong Yu\ncould react, a dark shadow pounced on\nhim. It turned out that the human-faced\nspider from before had returned to\nlaunch a sneak attack. Chapter 17. The\nmutant spider baby with the ability to\ncure poison. The massive body of the\nhuman-faced spider pressed down on Fong\nYu, its sharp pincers slicing across\nFong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s chest, the boar's\nbreastplate barely blocking the attack.\nBut then it turned to Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s\nface, opening its mandibles to bite\ndown. Fong Yu hurriedly raised his arm\nto block, but the sharp fangs pierced\nhis arm. The pain shot through him, and\nhe immediately picked up the torch and\nstruck the head of the human-faced\nspider. After the torch struck, the\nspider released its grip, but just as it\nprepared to attack again. Alpha pounced\nand bit its abdomen. Alpha bit into the\nspider's weak spot. Blood splattered and\nthe spider struggled wildly in agony.\nFong Yu seized the opportunity to stand\nup, preparing to fight back, but spiders\nbegan to gather around him. Fong Yu\nimmediately shouted, \"Run!\" and ran out\nof the woods. Unaware that the poisonous\nwound on his arm was spreading, turning\nit a bluish gray, he continued running,\nthe venom splashing onto the pink spider\neggs in his hand. Soon, Fong Yu ran out\nof the woods with Alpha close behind,\nbut Fong Yu began to feel dizzy, and the\nsystem alerted him that he had been\npoisoned. You have been poisoned by the\nvenom of the human-faced spider. We\nrecommend finding an antidote\nimmediately. Fong Yu collapsed quickly,\nthe poison on his arms spreading\nthroughout his body, and his vision went\nblack as he fell to the ground. Seeing\nthis, Alpha let out a soft whimper and\nprepared to drag Fong Yu back to the\ncabin. However, at that moment, the\nspider egg in Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s hand began\nto wrigle, and a small spider hatched.\nAfter sucking Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s blood, the\nlittle spider recognized Fong Yu as its\nmaster. When it sensed Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s\nlife force draining away, it hurriedly\ncrawled towards Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s wound.\nAlpha seemed to realize something and\nlet out a low growl. Sensing the threat,\nthe little spider quickly crawled\ntowards Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s arm and began\nbiting at the wound. Mutant spider baby.\nThis spider's venom has an antidote\neffect capable of neutralizing most\ntoxins. It is a rare baby spider. Fongu\nopened his eyes and found himself being\nlicked awake. Alpha was lowering its\nhead and rubbing against him with its\ntongue. Fongu struggled to sit up and\nwiped the saliva off his face. He saw\nthat the wound no longer hurt and the\nbluish gray color on his arm was\nbeginning to fade. Looking down, he saw\na small pink spider crawling on his arm.\nHoly crap. Fong Yu was so startled that\nhe flung his hand away, sending the\nlittle spider flying. Recalling what had\njust happened, Fong Yu finally\nunderstood. He had been poisoned by the\nhuman-faced spider, but this mutated\nbaby spider had cured him. Alpha looked\nat him and nodded. Fong Yu smiled. It\nseems you guys really helped me a lot.\nThe little spider crawled back to Fong\nYu&lt;unk&gt;s side. Fong Yu noticed that its\nname was in blue, indicating that it was\na rare species. Since you've\nacknowledged me as your master, then\nstay, Fong Yu said softly. The little\nspider awoke from its dizziness and\ncrawled toward Fong Yu, seemingly having\ncompletely accepted him as its master.\nChapter 18. There is no right or wrong\nin the adult world. Fong Yu looked at\nthe pink spider in his hand. Although he\nwas a little afraid of insects,\nespecially hairy ones, this little\nspider had no hair and looked more like\na crab, which was rather cute. Its six\neyes gleamed with a black luster, making\nit incredibly adorable. \"Thank you for\nsaving me,\" Fong Yu said to the little\nspider. The little spider seemed to\nsense his kindness, gently waving its\npincers, looking playful and cute. Fongu\nsmiled, too. The thought that it could\ndetoxify greatly reduced Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s\nresistance to it, and he even felt that\nit had become his trump card for\nsurvival. But I should give you a name,\"\nhe muttered to himself, deciding to wait\nfor Valentina to come out and help him\nthink of a name. Back in the cabin,\nFongu placed the little spider on the\ntable and asked, \"Want something to\neat?\" The little spider shook its tail,\nclearly not wanting meat. Fongu took out\na berry and it actually started eating\nit. \"So, you like berries? What a\nstrange little spider?\" Fongu said with\na smile. Don't worry, you'll have plenty\nto eat from now on if you come with me.\nAlpha looked at the wild bore meat on\nthe table and Fong Yu laughed. Hungry?\nI'm hungry, too. Let's have some\nbarbecue. While grilling the meat, Fongu\nchecked his day's catch. He had hunted a\nlarge quantity of pork in the west and\ncollected spiderw webs, spider glands,\nand mutated spider eggs in the east.\nAlthough the process was fraught with\ndanger, the rewards were substantial.\nThe 50 pieces of meat had already been\nsold at the exchange and the backpack\nwas full. So, the system stored the\nitems in the warehouse. Funu put the\nspiderw webs and spider glands that he\ndidn't need for the time being into the\nwarehouse and the backpack was emptied.\nHe decided to make a bigger backpack,\nchecked the workbench, and found that\nthe pigkin backpack was the largest\navailable. Pigkin backpack can hold 15\nitems, but they still needed two more\npigkins. Fong Yu thought that he could\ngo boar hunting with Alpha tomorrow.\nSoon after, the barbecue was ready and\nit got dark. Fong Yu opened the chat\nchannel, intending to check other\nplayers loot. Instead, he saw dozens of\nmessages from him. Lu Huashu ID 9123.\nFong Yu ID006,\nyou're amazing. How did you manage to\nget so much wild boar meat? Huang Shan\nID 4516. I've been eating berries for\ntwo days now and you still have 50\npieces of meat. Chin Fei ID 519 Fong Yu\nID006.\nHey bro, could you share a piece of meat\nwith me? Other players are also debating\nwhether resources should be allocated\nwith differing opinions. Some believe\nthat resources earned through skill\nshould be at their disposal while others\nbelieve that those with stronger\nabilities should allocate resources to\nthe weaker ones. Fongu sneered and\nclosed the chat channel. He understood\nthat in this world there was no right or\nwrong only different perspectives. Why\nshould he share the resources he had\nrisked his life for with others? Chad\nGPT says chapter 19 making a forging\nfurnace. Funu turned off the chat\nchannel. After finishing his barbecue,\nhe and Alpha prepared to wash up. With\nsupplies no longer scarce, it was time\nto improve their quality of life. He\nmade two towels out of linen, one for\nwashing his face and one for washing his\nfeet. Making toothbrushes required wool\nand wood. He could make 20 at a time,\nand he made a batch. The rest was\ntoothpaste, but due to his insufficient\ntech tree level, he had to use wood ash\nfrom the fireplace as a substitute.\nAlthough the taste wasn't great, the\neffect was acceptable. After washing up,\nFongu lay down on the bed to rest,\nhaving faced too many life or death or\ntoday. In the morning, he killed two\nwild boares in the western woods. And in\nthe afternoon, he went to the spider's\nnest in the east, nearly being bitten to\ndeath by a highly venomous spider.\nFortunately, the last hatched spiderling\nneutralized the poison, otherwise he\nwould have been dead long ago. The\nsystem indicates that he is currently in\na weakened state with his physical and\nmental limits reduced by 50% and\nsuggests that he sleep to recover. Just\nas Fong Yu was about to rest, a\nmelodious song drifted from the roof\nbeams, accompanied by a system\nnotification. The ghost Valentina is\nsinging a lullaby for you. The lullaby\ncan purify weakened states and restore\nyour sanity. Funu looked at the roof\nbeam and thanked Valentina. The singing\nmade him feel refreshed. Valentina\nsmiled and floated down from the\nrafters, sitting down at the table and\ncarefully examining the little pink\nspider on it. So cute. Fong Yu raised an\neyebrow. You think spiders are cute?\nValentina looked at the spider and\nsmiled. Can we give it a name? Fongu\nnodded. Have you decided on a name yet?\nI once saw a beautiful pink flower in\nthe West Sea called the hibiscus.\nValentina said, \"Hibiscus? Isn't that\njust cherry blossom?\" Funu asked. Sakura\nis even better. Valentina smiled. Little\nSakura, you have a name now. At the same\ntime, the skeleton in the corner of the\nliving room began to assemble, and the\nskeleton Ryan stood up. Fong Yu smiled\nand said, \"I saw a lot of wood outside\nthis morning. Did you chop it up last\nnight? Thanks.\" The skeleton shrugged,\nwhich translates to it said it just\nwanted to help. \"You're welcome.\" The\nskeleton stretched out his hand, and\nFong Yu took a rusty iron ax from his\nbackpack and handed it to him. The\nskeleton took the axe, turned around,\nand walked out of the wooden house.\nFongu called out to him, deeply moved.\n\"Thank you.\" Valentina covered her\nmouth, and smiled, not intending to tell\nFong Yu that Ryan had taken the\ninitiative to cut down trees because he\nthought Fongu was too slow. Looking at\nthe skeleton, Ryan, Fong Yu felt a pang\nof emotion. He knew he needed to work\neven harder. Meanwhile, Valentina had\nlifted his weakened state, and Fong Yu\nbegan studying the construction of the\nforge. After the haunted house in the\nwoods was upgraded, the crafting of the\nforge was unlocked. Forging furnace used\nfor refining ores, and firing items.\nManufacturing requirements: 210/20\ngravel, 10 charcoal, or coal cannot be\nmanufactured. Charcoal and coal became\ncrucial. Fong Yu checked the wood in the\nfireplace and found it hadn't burned\ninto charcoal yet. Coal, on the other\nhand, needed to be obtained from the\nmining area or underground mines. He\ndecided to check the exchange for coal\nand found a player selling it,\nexchanging one piece of coal for one\npiece of wood. Fongu used 10 pieces of\nwood to buy 10 pieces of coal, thus\nmeeting the requirements for building a\nforge. The forging furnace is now\ncomplete. Please select a placement\nlocation. Fong Yu decided to place the\nforging furnace in the corner of the\nliving room as the room had limited\nspace and this was the most suitable\nplace. After completing the forging\nfurnace, Funu began testing its\nfunctions. He used three pieces of meat\nto buy 15 portions of iron ore and put\nthem into the forging furnace to begin\nsmelting. The forging furnace is\ncurrently firing. Firing completion time\n14 minutes and 55 seconds. Chapter 20.\nKnowing about the merged zones in\nadvance while the forging furnace was\nfiring, Fong Yu opened the chat channel\nagain and found that the number of\nplayers had dropped to 8,980,\nwhich meant that more than 100 people\nhad died in just one afternoon. The\nwinter challenge hadn't even started\nyet, and the number of players had\nalready decreased by 10%. He continued\nbrowsing the chat history and found that\nsome players were teaming up for\nsurvival, but most players didn't choose\nthis option. The reason was simple.\nTeaming up required a team leader and\nthe other team members houses would be\nreclaimed with only 50% of the upgrade\nresources returned. Team members lost\ntheir ability to survive independently\nand had to rely on the team leader which\nmade most players unwilling to easily\nform teams. In the chat channel, a\nfemale player complained about being\nrobbed of her supplies by male players\nwho even threatened her with weapons.\nMany other players also reported being\nrobbed and some were even injured. As\nfor whether anyone died, no one knows\nbecause the deceased cannot speak.\nFunside, although these things were none\nof his business, he knew that this world\nwas full of dangers and without legal\nconstraints, players could only rely on\ntheir own abilities to survive. Through\nthe chat logs, Fongu realized that with\nthe arrival of winter, many players\nwould face death. The game was divided\ninto 10 regions, each with approximately\n10,000 players, and interreional\ncompetition was likely to be introduced\nin the future. To verify this\nhypothesis, Fong Yu asked the game\nassistant, Xiaolu, Xiaolu, is he there?\nWhat's up? Will different areas be open?\nYes, but it will happen in 16 days. 16\ndays from now, what will happen then?\nThe winter challenge lasts for 3 days\nfollowed by each season lasting 3 days.\nThe area will open after 16 days. Will\nthere be inter regional conflict? Of\ncourse, after the regions are opened up,\nthere will not only be competition, but\nalso rankings. Rankings? Yes. The system\nwill issue different rewards and\npenalties based on the amount of\nresources acquired in each area. Punish.\nThat's right. The bottom five ranked\nareas will be populated by epic level\nferocious beasts while the top five\nranked areas will be populated by\nauspicious beasts. Fongu was taken\naback. An epic level ferocious beast.\nIt's probably a dragon level being. Fong\nwas stunned. This punishment was simply\ninhuman. A giant dragon could destroy an\nentire region and might even lead to the\nextinction of the entire area. Yes. So,\nyou need to hurry and gather more\nresources. By the way, it's also\nimportant to help other players in your\nregion and maintain the overall strength\nof region 6. Keep going, young man.\nFongu learned from Xiaolu that the\nregion would face competition in the\nfuture and to avoid disaster, they would\nneed to collect more resources, not just\nrely on themselves. He realized that he\ncouldn't complete the task alone and\nwould need the help of other players.\nWhy look at the total amount of supplies\nfor the entire district instead of the\namount of supplies for individuals? This\nis a survival game for everyone. Testing\nnot only individual survival skills, but\nalso the survival skills of the entire\nrace. Funu frowned, thinking about the\nbigger picture. He suddenly realized\nthat this game was far more complex than\nhe had imagined, and it concerned the\nlife and death of humanity. He replied\nhelplessly, \"I can't even take care of\nmyself. How can I take care of the\nbigger picture? You are the chosen one,\ndestined for the continuation of human\ncivilization. You bear a heavy\nresponsibility. Go for it, young man.\nChapter 21. How to utilize the power of\nothers. When Fongu woke up, it was\nalready broad daylight. After careful\nconsideration last night, he came up\nwith a plan that would both improve the\noverall strength of the players in zone\n6 and allow him to profit. He realized\nthat venturing out to explore was\nextremely dangerous. If he hadn't been\nwearing the wild boar armor, he might\nhave been disembowled when the\nhuman-faced spider ambushed him. The\nimportance of the armor was\nself-evident. Therefore, Fongu decided\nto hunt wild boores today, craft wild\nboar armor, and sell it through the\nexchange. Wild boar armor can greatly\nimprove the safety of newcomers and\nreduce the mortality rate and there will\nbe high demand for it on the exchange\nfrom which fong you can profit.\nFurthermore, after obtaining the wild\nboar armor, players survivability will\nbe improved and they will be more secure\nwhen going out to collect resources\nwhich will indirectly increase the total\namount of resources in zone 6. Next,\nFongu decided to use roasted red\nmushrooms to lure the wild boars. Red\nmushrooms are highly attractive to wild\nboores and can put them into a\nhallucinatory state, making them easy to\nkill. After finishing their roasted wild\nboar, Fong Yu and Alpha went outside. As\nsoon as they stepped outside, he saw a\npile of timber, which put him in a great\nmood. Take it. Received 280 wood. After\ncollecting the timber, Fong Yu took the\nrusty iron axe and then led Alpha into\nthe forest to begin collecting red\nmushrooms. After searching for more than\nan hour, Fong Yu collected 45 red\nmushrooms and began roasting them after\nreturning to the cabin. To increase\nefficiency, he used both the fireplace\nand the campfire. But even so, it still\ntook more than half an hour to roast all\nthe mushrooms. While waiting for the\nmushrooms to finish baking, Fun Yu\nthought of another way to make money. He\ncould buy red mushrooms at a low price\nthrough the exchange, then inform other\nplayers of their value and sell them at\na higher price. profiting from the\ndifference. He became curious whether\nother players already knew about the red\nmushrooms effect on wild boores. So he\nasked the game assistant. The fact that\nred mushrooms are effective against wild\nboores is hidden information. Other\nplayers assistants will not proactively\ntell them this. Fongu suddenly realized\nthat the game assistant could provide\nhidden information which was an\nunexpected bonus. Soon after the 45 red\nmushrooms were roasted and Fong Yu led\nthem an alpha into the western forest.\nAfter some time they found the juvenile\nwild boar they had seen before. Fongu\nquietly approached and took out a\nroasted red mushroom. The wild boar was\nimmediately attracted and after eating\nthe mushroom, it began to circle and\nconvulse, falling into a hallucinatory\nstate. Fong Yu quickly picked up the\niron axe and struck the wild boar,\nsuccessfully killing it. Received 20\nwild boar meat, two pig skins, and five\npig bones. Then Fong Yu and Alpha\ncontinued hunting. In just 2 hours, they\nkilled eight wild boars and harvested\n160 pieces of meat, 16 pigkins, and 40\npig bones. As the surrounding wild\nboores began to stir, Fong Yu decided to\nretreat and return to the cabin. Back in\nthe cabin, Fongu organized his supplies\nand found his backpack was full. He\ndecided to make a pigkin backpack from\npigkin. Pigkin backpack can hold 15\nitems. Production requirements: 16\npigkins, six flax. Make it. Pigkin\nbackpack being made. Time remaining 9\nminutes 58 seconds. After finishing the\nfirst piece, Funu planned to continue\nmaking the wild boar armor. However, he\ndiscovered that he only had 14 wild boar\nhides left, and he needed seven more to\nmake a complete set. So, Fongu decided\nto make money using red mushrooms. He\nplanned to tell other players about the\nwonderful uses of red mushrooms and get\nthem to help hunt wild boores.\nAfterward, he would buy wild boar hides\nat a low price, then craft wild boar\narmor and sell it at a high price. In\nthis way, he can achieve a win-win\nsituation. Not only can he earn the\nprice difference, but he can also\nimprove the survivability of other\nplayers, indirectly increasing the\namount of resources collected in zone 6.\nI'm a genius. Fongu slapped his thigh\nand decided to take action immediately.\nChapter 22 upgrade the spacious haunted\nhouse in the woods. After listing over\n100 pieces of wild boar meat on the\nexchange, Fong Yu used the acquired\nresources to purchase a large number of\nred mushrooms, exchanging for nearly\n2,000 in total, practically wiping out\nall the red mushrooms in the exchange.\nHe then revealed the special effects of\nthe red mushroom on wild boores in the\nchat channel, which instantly attracted\na lot of attention and discussion from\nplayers. Hang Shan ID 4516. Really?\nThere's a group of wild boares around\nhere and I have to be careful of them\nevery time I go out. Tion Ji Kong\nID7171.\nI also have wild boar here. Fong Yu\nID006. Can you sell me some red\nmushrooms? Le Shan Long ID212. That's\nawesome. I want to try it too. As red\nmushrooms in the exchange were gradually\nsnapped up, their price skyrocketed.\nInitially, one red mushroom could be\nexchanged for one piece of wood, but\nlater the price rose to eight pieces of\nwood each. After seeing that the price\nhad stabilized, Fongu listed 2,000 red\nmushrooms at 8 wood each and quickly\ncompleted the transaction, earning a\nlarge amount of wood, gravel, and other\nresources needed to upgrade his house.\nThis transaction yielded an 800% profit,\nmaking Fong Yu feel like he had jumped\ndirectly from a comfortable life to a\nmiddle-class lifestyle. With ample\nsupplies, he decided to start upgrading\nhis wooden house. Sturdy forest haunted\nhouse, one bedroom, 30sqm. Spacious\nforest haunted house, one bedroom, one\nliving room, 40sqm. Upgrade\nrequirements: wood 500500,\ngravel 200/200,\nmud 100/00,\nvines 100 out of 100 cannot be upgraded.\nHe had enough materials to upgrade\nimmediately. As the cabin gradually\nexpanded, a kitchen and a toilet were\nadded. The new space made Fong Yu feel\nmuch more comfortable. Ghost Valentina's\ntrust plus 20, Skeleton Ryan's trust\nplus 30, Corpse Dog Alpha's trust plus\n40. With Skeleton Ryan's trust level\nreaching 100, it officially became Fong\nYu's friend and will protect him in\ntimes of danger in the future. Chapter\n23 set a small goal, the manor. When\nFong Yu woke up, it was already bright\ndaylight. After thinking it over all\nnight, he came up with a way to improve\nthe overall strength of the players in\nzone 6 and also to make a profit for\nhimself. His encounter in the spider\nforest to the east made him realize the\ndangers of venturing out. The value of\nwild boar armor was obvious. It could\nprotect him and also help other players\nimprove their survival skills. So, he\ndecided to hunt wild boores, craft them,\nand sell the armor at a high price for\nprofit. He also remembered the special\neffects of red mushrooms, which could\nlure wild boores and were cheap.\nReselling red mushrooms for a profit\ncould bring him considerable income.\nAfter lunch, Fongu slung his pigskin\nbackpack over his shoulder and with\nAlpha re-entered the western boar\nforest. However, the boar herd had\nalready swarmed together and a huge boar\nlord had appeared. So, Fong Yu decided\nto retreat. He suddenly remembered that\nhe hadn't been able to collect many\nsupplies when he retreated from the\nspider forest in the east yesterday. So\nhe and Alpha went to the spider forest\nwith little spider cherry blossom just\nin case. This time Fongu carefully\ncarried a torch and an iron axe, finally\narriving at the ruins of the burned\nspider nest. Although the nest was\npartially destroyed, the interior\nremained intact. Basic spider nest\nproduces a certain number of ordinary\nspiders daily, which can be dismantled\nto obtain a large amount of spider webs.\nHe decided to dismantle the spider's\nnest to collect the webs. Fortunately,\nhe had an iron axe, rusty, but still\nusable. Fongu chopped about 300 times,\nfinally dismantling the spider nest and\nobtaining a lot of spiderw webs.\nSpiderweb, pick it up. Pick it up.\nObtain spiderweb one. obtain spiderweb\none. Obtain spiderweb one. Chapter 24\nalpha can actually evolve. After picking\nup the spiderw webs on the ground, Fongu\nwas surprised to find that he had\nobtained 92. He decided to study the\nuses of these spiderw webs. At that\nmoment, Fongu noticed that Alfa was\ngnawing on a charred pumpkin-ized\nspider. He went over to take a look and\ndiscovered that the spider actually had\nflesh that could be broken down. burnt\nspider decomposing it yields spider\nfangs and spider meat. Fongu thought\nthat spider meat could be used as pet\nfood. Although it contained mild toxins\nand was not suitable for human\nconsumption, it was just right for\nAlpha. He found more spider corpses\naround. Harvesting 88 pieces of spider\nmeat and 44 pairs of spider fangs. After\neating the spider, Alpha became more\nactive and Fongu noticed its changes. It\ngrew a tongue and tail, had skin on its\nbody, and its body shape became more\nsymmetrical. The demon dog, Alpha,\nevolves by consuming monster meat. The\nhigher the grade of the monster meat,\nthe more it stimulates Alpha's\nevolutionary abilities. Fa was surprised\nto find that Alpha could actually\nevolve. Its name changed from gray to\nwhite, and its grade improved from\ndilapitated to ordinary. The evolved\nalpha looked much stronger. Fongu\nquickly fed it some more spider meat.\nAfter Alpha finished eating, it seemed\nfull and ran off. Fong Yu was filled\nwith anticipation, wanting to see what\nit would eventually evolve into. After\ncollecting all the spider's spoils, Fong\nYu prepared to leave. He looked at the\ngiant tree that had once transformed\ninto a tree man, wondering what\nmaterials he might obtain by cutting it\ndown, but he knew he was currently no\nmatch for the tree man. On the return\njourney, Fong Yu and Alpha remained\nvigilant, still shaken by the previous\nambush. But this time, they encountered\nno danger. Fong Yu was puzzled. Had the\nhuman-faced spider simply vanished. Back\nin the cabin, Fongu placed the little\nspider Sakura on the roof beam and began\nto think about how to deal with the\nspider meat. Considering that spider\nmeat only has a shelf life of 3 days and\nmight cause discomfort, he decided to\nlist most of the spider meat for sale on\nthe exchange, Fong Yu listed 60 pieces\nof spider meat on the exchange, priced\nat 10 pieces of wood each. Because this\nstuff had side effects, he set the price\nlower. Soon, the chat channel became\nlively again. Yao Jiwen ID 357 spider\nmeat. Is that edible? Le Chunlong ID\n212. The spiders in this game are\ndifferent. The ones I encountered were\nbigger than pumpkins. Chapter 25. Spider\nmeat is still meat. Why should we look\ndown on it? Fongu turned off the chat\nchannel and stopped paying attention to\nthe players nonsense. Those who find\nspider meat disgusting are mostly female\nplayers. Male players are more forgiving\nwith some occasionally willing to try\nit. This demonstrates the difference in\nadaptability between men and women in\nsurvival environments. clearly showing\nthat modern urban life has made some\nwomen more delicate. Fun didn't care.\nSpider meat is meat and it's cheap.\nThere's no reason to complain. If you\ndon't like it, just don't buy it.\nThere's no need to complain about it in\nthe chat channel. If you want to eat\nwild boar meat, you can go hunting\nyourself. He has already shared the\nmethod of hunting wild boar with red\nmushrooms, which can be tried by those\nwho are brave enough. Funu understood\nthat hunger was the real threat. The\nwinter challenge was just around the\ncorner and food supplies were crucial.\nThe others were being picky and fussy,\npractically asking for trouble. The\nwinter challenges are about to begin.\nThe environment will be harsher, food\nresources will become scarce, and may\neven become completely unavailable. At\nthat time, diarrhea and weakness will be\nworse than starving to death. Although\nthe winter challenge only lasts for 3\ndays, once your hunger or thirst level\nreaches zero, your stamina will drop\nrapidly. And if your stamina reaches\nzero, you will die instantly. Food is\nthe most important resource in survival\ngames, and all players must stock up on\nit. Despite some players complaining\nabout the spider meat, Fong Yu quickly\nreceived a transaction notification. In\nless than 10 minutes, all 60 pieces of\nspider meat were snapped up. Anyone with\neyes can see that exchanging 10 wood for\none piece of spider meat, and chopping\ndown a tree takes only an hour. Spider\nmeat replenishes 80 hunger points,\nenough to last a day, making it a very\nworthwhile trade. As for weakness, it\nwill recover after a good night's sleep.\nFor players who don't plan to go out and\nexplore, it's basically not a problem.\nFong Yu inspected the warehouse. 60\npieces of spider meat had been exchanged\nfor 300 pieces of wood. 100 pieces of\nflax and 50 buckets of water. Seeing the\n50 buckets of water, Fong Yu was\noverjoyed. Finally, there's water. He\nimmediately thought of using water to\nboil water and prepare to take a bath.\nHe had been in the game for 3 days\nstraight, almost without stopping, and\nhis clothes were already soaked with\nsweat and pigs blood, emitting an\nextremely pungent odor. Now that we have\nwater, all we need to do is make a\nkettle so we can start taking a bath.\nWhile other players were still\nstruggling to find water, Fa was already\nthinking about taking hot showers.\nThat's the difference. Although there\nwas no shower, he had already planned to\nmake a large wooden tub for bathing,\nwhich would only cost 10 units of wood,\nmaking it entirely affordable. Funu\nimmediately began making a kettle at the\nworkbench. Kitchen utensils. Kettle,\nzero out of two iron ingots, cannot be\ncrafted. Iron pot zero of three iron\ningots cannot be crafted. Kitchen knife\nzero to one iron ingot cannot be\ncrafted. Iron ingots. Fongu suddenly\nremembered that he had smelted 15 iron\nores in the forge. So he immediately\nopened the forge to check. Received 15\niron ingots. With the iron ingots in\nhand, Fongu didn't hesitate to start\nmaking kettles. Considering he didn't\nhave a thermos, he decided to make three\nkettles and a large wooden bucket, even\nif it was a little extravagant. While\nthe kettle and the large wooden barrel\nwere being made, Funu took out a\nspiderweb and began to study its uses.\nSpiderwe, the web woven by adult\nspiders, is sticky and tough, suitable\nfor use as an adhesive or trap. When\ncombined with linen, it can be used to\nmake thermal underwear. Thermal\nunderwear. Funu smiled. With the final\nnight of the winter challenge\napproaching, all the players began to\nworry about staying warm. And Fong Yu\nwas no exception. Although he had a\ncabin and fireplace, as well as food and\nwater, and could easily spend the winter\nin the cabin, he didn't want to waste\nthose 3 days, he knew he needed to\nimprove his strength. During the 3 days\nof winter, going out to find supplies is\nessential, and keeping warm is obviously\nthe top priority. At this point, thermal\nunderwear is undoubtedly the solution.\nNot only can you use it yourself, but\nyou can also sell the surplus for a good\nprice. Fu quickly went to the crafting\nstation to check the crafting options.\nFortunately, thermal underwear is a\nwhite grade item and doesn't require a\nblueprint. Warm clothing 13 and 1/2\nspiderweb 10 and six halves linen\ncraftable. Thermal pants 13 and a half\nspiderweb 10 and six halves linen can be\ncrafted. A set of thermal underwear\nrequires four spiderw webs. So Fongu\nimmediately made 25 sets, leaving 31\nspiderw webs for later use. You will put\nany extra thermal underwear on the\nexchange once the winter challenge\nofficially begins. The thermal underwear\nis being made. Time remaining 4 hours, 9\nminutes, and 55 seconds. Chapter 26.\nPastor, shall I rub your back? Fongu\nglanced at the remaining thermal\nunderwear. It would take another 4 hours\nto finish. He decided to use that time\nto do something else. The kettle was\nready, so he prepared to take a shower.\nThere was a large wooden tub in the\ntoilet. Although the space wasn't large,\nit was more than enough to fit the tub.\nTo fill it with water, Fongu boiled 18\nkettles of water, which took half an\nhour, and finally filled the tub. Once\nthe water temperature was just right,\nFong Yu couldn't wait to jump into the\nwooden tub and let out a satisfied sigh.\nAh, so comfortable. This bath was simply\nthe best reward for 3 days of hard work.\nJust as he was relaxing, a melodious\nvoice came from above. Master, are you\ntaking a bath? Fa was startled and\nquickly covered himself. He looked up\nand saw Valentina floating beside the\nwooden tub. How did you get in? He asked\nin surprise. Valentina pointed upwards.\nThe beams are open. Fongu was stunned.\nIt turned out that when he took off his\nclothes, the female ghost had seen him\ncompletely naked. Holy Fong Yu\nfelt utterly ashamed and buried his head\nin the water, groaning softly. Valentina\nstared, stunned at Fong Yu's panicked\nexpression. Just then, skeleton Ryan\nwalked into the bathroom, saw the scene,\nand began to speak, clicking his jaw.\nValentina replied irritably. It's none\nof my business. He buried himself in the\nwater. Skeleton Ryan scratched his head\nin confusion, seemingly not\nunderstanding what had happened either.\nA few minutes later, Fong Yu finally\nmustered the courage to lift his head\nout of the water. Is something wrong? He\ntried his best to appear calm. Valentina\nsmiled and said, \"The temperature\noutside is starting to drop, so be\ncareful not to get cold while you sleep\ntonight.\" Fongu felt a gust of cold wind\nblow into the wooden house and\nimmediately reminded himself to keep\nwarm. Thank you. I understand. Valentina\nthen asked. Would you like me to rub\nyour back? Fongu was taken aback and\nlooked at her translucent ghostly\nfigure. Can you touch the physical body?\nNo, she replied. Then how do you rub it?\nFongu asked puzzled. Valentina pointed\nto the skeleton Ryan. It can help you\nrub it. Fong Yu immediately lost\ninterest and quickly asked Valentina and\nskeleton Ryan to leave. Although Fong Yu\nwas somewhat curious, he still couldn't\naccept a ghost rubbing his back, let\nalone a moving creaking skeleton doing\nthe same thing. After taking a bath,\nFongu got dressed, wondering what he\ncould do with the water. He finally\ndecided to use it to flush the toilet.\nThe cold wind outside was getting\nstronger, and the temperature inside the\nhouse was dropping rapidly. Fong Yu\nsneezed a few times and quickly added\nsome wood and branches to the fireplace.\nWarm by the fireplace, Fong Yu saw\nValentina playing with the little\nspider, Cherry Blossom, on the roof\nbeam, the corpse dog, Alpha, lying in\nits nest in the grass, and the skeleton\nRyan was nowhere to be seen. Fongu\nguessed that it had probably gone to\nchop down trees again. Fongu walked to\nthe door and saw that it was snowing\nheavily outside. The snow was gradually\npiling up and the temperature had\ndropped below zero. He secretly rejoiced\nthat he had prepared enough cobwebs and\nthermal underwear and expected that he\ncould cope with the cold weather\nsmoothly the next day. The fireplace is\nwarm tonight, but without enough warm\nclothing, he might not be able to go out\ntomorrow. He hopes he can withstand the\ncoming winter. Chapter 27. Valentina's\nupgrade method. Fongu returned to the\nfireplace, sat down, warmed himself by\nthe fire, and opened the chat channel.\nAt this moment, the chat channel was\nbustling with activity as all the\nplayers were discussing the sudden drop\nin temperature. Tion Kong, ID7171.\nHoly crap, isn't winter supposed to\nstart tomorrow? Why is it so cold\ntonight? Su Linland, ID59. Yeah, I was\nthinking of upgrading the cabin\ntomorrow, but I'm still in the shed.\nIt's freezing. Jeang Pong ID7761.\nIf you don't have a wooden cabin, you\ncan do what I did. Move the wooden shed\nto the side of a mountain wall or rock\nto block the wind from two or three\nsides. And you can barely keep warm by\nsurrounding it with a campfire. Lu dugay\nID702\nJeang Pong ID7761.\nBrother, you're so clever. I'll hurry up\nand make more campfires, too. Meow.\nWfin. ID 4546. I'm still 15 which short\nof upgrading my log cabin. I'm willing\nto trade 10 berries for it. It's already\nlisted on the exchange. Yao Jiwen ID\n357. Where's the guy who sold spider\nmeat at noon? Do you still have any?\nI'll buy it at a high price. Woo Baoang\nID7876.\nHoly crap. There are actually people\nbuying spider meat at high prices. Why?\nYao Jiwin ID 357 spider meat is better\nthan wild boar meat. It's crunchy and\ntastes like chicken. I'm addicted. Xiao\nYini ID909. It's true. I've tried it,\ntoo. The meat is incredibly tender and\ndelicious. Lie Chong Leang ID888.\nYour tastes are so perverted. After\nreading the chat channel, Fong Yu\nunderstood that the player survivability\nwas beginning to diverge. Players with\nstrong survival skills have already\nbuilt wooden huts and even have surplus\nsupplies to exchange for food. Players\nwith weaker survival skills can only ek\nout a living in wooden shacks, relying\non campfires for warmth. But when\nconsumption is high, and if they cannot\nsolve the food problem, they will be\nunable to leave the huts the next day.\nFunu realized that after tonight, a\ngroup of players would definitely die.\nHe sighed. Although he wasn't a saint,\nhe still felt some sympathy. After all,\nit was a cruel survival game, and\neveryone had to adapt to the rules.\nAfter closing the chat channel, Fong Yu\nsuddenly remembered something and looked\nup at the female ghost on the roof beam.\nValentina,\nwhat is it? Valentina looked down at\nFong Yu. I only learned today that alpha\ncan evolve. Evolution. Valentina tilted\nher head, seemingly not quite\nunderstanding. Fong Yu pointed to Alpha\nin the doghouse. Look, its tail has\ngrown back and its skin has started to\ngrow back, too. It's like it's evolving.\nValentina nodded. Alpha can evolve as\nlong as it has meat to eat. And what\nabout you? Fong Yu looked at the female\nghost. Can you evolve? Valentina paused\nfor a moment, then nodded. As expected,\nFongu raised an eyebrow. Then why didn't\nyou tell me sooner? Valentina smiled and\nsaid, \"You've only just arrived, and it\nmust be hard enough for you to adapt to\nthe environment, so I didn't tell you.\"\nFongu smiled. Riley, you are such a kind\nand understanding girl. Valentina\nlowered her head shily. After hearing\nFong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s words, Alpha, who was\nunder the table, stuck out its tongue.\nFong Yu continued, \"Now that I know,\ntell me. How can I help you evolve?\"\nValentina bit her lip, hesitated for a\nmoment, and then whispered, \"Soul power!\nSoul power? What is that?\" Fongu asked\ncuriously. \"It's the power of the soul\nleaving the body after a living being\ndies,\" Valentina explained. Fong Yu\nsuddenly realized, \"You evolved by\ndevouring souls.\" Valentina nodded. Fong\nYu felt a chill run down his spine. He\nnever expected that this seemingly\ngentle female ghost would have the\nability to devour souls. Seeing Fong\nYu&lt;unk&gt;s expression change, Valentina\nquickly explained, \"I only devour the\nsouls of animals and plants.\" \"Animals?\"\nFunu asked. Yes, rabbits, goats, wild\nboars, even dead trees. Valentina\nnodded. Few. Fongu breathed a sigh of\nrelief. However, sometimes I also devour\nthe souls of evil people. Valentina\nblinked. Fong Yu immediately began to\nreflect on the bad things he had done.\nIf it's an animal spirit, I should be\nable to help, Fong Yu said with a smile.\nI'll take care of it for you at night\nwhen I catch animals in the future.\nValentina smiled. Actually, I can absorb\nthe sole power of the animals you kill\nat night, so there's no need to bring\nthem to me specifically. Fongu raised an\neyebrow. That's not bad. Valentina\nlaughed and said, \"So, you don't need to\ndo anything special for me. That won't\ndo. Since we're partners, we have to\nhelp each other.\" Fong said, \"Looks like\nwe'll have to hunt more wild boores and\nspiders in the future.\" Just then, Alfa\nsuddenly jumped out of its kennel,\nrushed to the front door, and barked\nincessantly. Fong Yu looked at it with a\npuzzled expression. Valentina seemed to\nsense something as well and turned to\nlook at the door. We don't need to wait\nuntil later. Something is coming to\ncause trouble now. Fongu listened\ncarefully and heard rustling sounds\ncoming from all around the wooden house.\nAs if something was climbing. There are\nthings outside the wooden house. And\njudging from the sound, there are many\nof them. Chapter 28. The haunted house\nis under siege. Fongu had always thought\nthe wooden house was a haunted house and\nthat monsters wouldn't dare approach it,\nbut the truth proved him completely\nwrong. Suddenly, a series of scraping\nsounds rang out from all around, clearly\nindicating that many things outside were\ntrying to get in. Alpha corpse dog bared\nits teeth and growled. Little cherry\nblossom, which had been hiding in the\nspiderweb, hung down from the roof beam\nand disappeared into Fong Yu's messy\nhair. Thump. The door was slammed open.\nFongu realized that after skeleton Ryan\nleft, he hadn't bolted the door. A giant\nblack spider crawled in from outside the\ndoor and Fongu instantly realized that\nit was the spider swarm he had killed\nearlier that had returned for revenge.\nHe immediately grabbed a chair and threw\nit at the spider. But the chair was\nuseless against it and shattered\ninstantly, though it did stop the\nspider's attack. Fong Yu took the\nopportunity to run to the bedroom and\ntook out a torch and a stone axe. The\nblack spider noticed Valentina floating\nin the living room and pounced on her.\nFong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s heart raced when he saw\nthis, but the spider passed through\nValentina's body and crashed into the\nwall. Fong Yu breathed a sigh of relief,\nbut then a second giant spider entered\nthe room. Alpha pounced on it quickly,\nforcing it out the door, and the two\nfought outside. A third spider arrived\nat the doorway. Fongu lit a torch and\nholding the torch and stone axe faced\nthe spider. The stone axe struck the\nspider's compound eye, splattering\nfluids everywhere. The spider retreated\nin pain but took the stone axe with it.\nFongu wanted to take back the stone axe,\nbut he saw that there were countless\nspiders in the snow outside and one was\nhanging on the door beam. Alpha nimly\nweave through the spider swarm,\noccasionally biting their rear ends,\nseemingly impervious to the spider's\nattacks. Close the door, Valentina\nshouted. But Alf is outside. It's all\nright. Close the door quickly. Helpless,\nFongu closed the door and bolted it.\nValentina exclaimed, \"Master, watch out\nbehind you.\" Fongu did not turn around,\nbut instead darted to the right. The\nnext second, the spider behind him\ncrashed into the door. Funu quickly\nturned around and waved the torch at the\nspider. Upon seeing the fire light, the\nspider took a few steps back, but once\nit reached the wall, it became even more\nferocious, slashing its front claws and\nknocking the torch from Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s\nhand. Oh no! Fong Yu hurriedly went to\npick up the torch, but the spider leaped\nup again and pounced on him. Just then,\nthe spider suddenly convulsed and fell\nto the ground. Before Fong Yu could\nreact, he heard Valentina shout, \"Quick,\nkill it.\" He saw Valentina controlling\nthe spider. Her hands pressed on its\nhead. Without hesitation, Fong Yu picked\nup the broken chair leg and plunged it\ninto the spider's head. Thud! The chair\nleg pierced the spider's brain, and the\nspider struggled for a few moments\nbefore dying. Fong Yu breathed a sigh of\nrelief, looked up and smiled at\nValentina. Master, you are amazing.\nValentina praised him with a smile.\nFongu was stunned. This was the first\ntime he had been praised by a woman, and\nhis face flushed slightly with the only\nspider that had entered the house dealt\nwith. Fongu was temporarily safe.\nHowever, more and more scraping sounds\ncame from all around, and the number of\nspiders outside was increasing. So, the\ncrisis was not over. How is Alpha? Fong\nYu asked in a low voice. Don't worry,\nit's fine. Valentina reassured her. Fong\nYu clenched his fists inside. He had\nthought he could live easily with the\nresources he had. But his current\npredicament made him realize that he\nwould have died long ago without Alpha\nand Valentina. Destructive sounds came\nfrom all around the cabin, and the\nspiders began to attack it. Your house\nis under attack. Durability 199/200.\nYour house is under attack. Durability\n198/200.\nChapter 29. No more pretense. Seeing the\nattack notification, Fong Youu frowned,\nespecially at the constantly decreasing\ndurability. This meant that given enough\ntime, the spiders outside would be able\nto break through the cabin's defenses\nand get in. At that point, Fongu inside\nthe house would only face certain death.\nIt seems that hiding in the cabin is not\na good idea. It's like waiting to die. I\nmight as well go out and fight to the\ndeath. As the saying goes, a cornered\ndog will jump over a wall and even a\nsalted fish will turn over when\ncornered. Moreover, he doesn't intend to\nlet Alpha fight alone outside. So, Fong\nYu went to the crafting table and made\ntin torches and a new iron axe. He then\nreturned to his bedroom and began\nputting on his wild boar armor. 5\nminutes later, Fun Yu stood in front of\nthe gate, carrying a brand new iron axe\nin one hand and a torch in the other.\n\"I'm going out to make a move,\" Funu\nsaid to Valentina. \"Do you want to come\nwith me?\" He knew the spider couldn't\nharm Valentina, which was why he asked\nthat question. While Valentina couldn't\ndirectly harm the spider, she could use\nmind control to put it into a brief\nstate of paralysis. So, having her along\nwould make both offense and defense much\nsafer. Valentina looked at Fong Yu, who\nwas now full of fighting spirit, and\nsmiled with satisfaction. As you wish,\ncrunch. The wooden door was pushed open,\nand Fongu walked out. He looked at the\nswarm of spiders in the snow, gripped\nthe iron ax in his hand, and charged\ntoward the nearest spider. Human\npotential is enormous, but it needs to\nbe explored. There are many ways to tap\ninto potential, but the most effective\nand direct method is to threaten someone\nwith death. If a person can overcome the\nfear of life and death, their mental and\nphysical will will be greatly enhanced.\nTake Fong Yu for example. Before\nentering this survival game, he was just\na home buddy supernatural novelist. But\nthrough the life and death trials of the\npast 2 days, plus tonight's spider swarm\nattack, this usually lazy and\nunambitious guy has undergone a\nqualitative transformation. If it were\nin the past, let alone seeing so many\ngiant spiders the size of millstones,\neven if a spider the size of a\nfingernail landed on him, he would have\nbeen ready to break dance on the spot.\nBut at this moment, he was able to\novercome this fear and charge towards\nthe ferocious and terrifying spiders\nwith his ax in hand. Perhaps this is a\nkind of growth, a kind of\ntransformation. When Fong Yu rushed out\nof the wooden house with a torch and an\niron axe in hand, the spiders outside\nseemed to be frightened by his imposing\npresence and scattered. What Fongu\ndidn't know was that Valentina floating\nbehind him had a strange purple light\nflashing in her eyes and an invisible\npressure was emanating from her. This\nwas the real reason why the spiders had\nscattered. Fongu assumed that the\nspiders had a natural fear of fire,\nwhich was why they were all avoiding it.\nSo, he used torches to create a ring of\nfire around the house. Because of\nValentina's imposing aura and the double\nthreat of the flames, the spiders\noutside the fire circle dared not enter.\nInstead, they began to surround and\nattack Alpha, who was fighting a gorilla\nwar on the outskirts. However, after the\nupgrade, Alpha was extremely agile, and\nthe spiders could not touch it at all.\nFong Yu stood inside the circle of fire,\nscanned the spiders around him, then\nlooked up at the few spiders still\nhiding on the roof, and frowned. He did\nnot see the shadow of the human-faced\nspider. Did it not come? Impossible.\nThese spiders all came from the woods to\nthe east. No one, not even a pig, would\nbelieve that these spiders have nothing\nto do with that human-faced demon\nspider. But where is it hiding? Just as\nFong Yu was wondering, suddenly a\nmournful howl of a corpse dog came from\nafar. Fongu was shocked and turned his\nhead to look. He saw that Alpha had\nfallen to the ground at some point, and\nits two front paws were wrapped in a\nball of white spider silk. Just then,\nanother clump of white spider silk shot\nout from the darkness and wrapped around\nAlfa's two hind legs. Fong Yu looked in\nthe direction the spider silk had come\nfrom and finally saw the human-faced\nspider with a human face on its belly at\nthe edge of the woods. Damn, this guy is\nso cunning. He actually hid in the\nshadows and launched a sneak attack.\nSeeing that Alpha's four legs were\nentangled in spiderw webs and that all\nthe spiders around it were swarming\ntowards it and that the dog's life was\nin imminent danger, Fong Yu immediately\npicked up an iron axe to try to rescue\nit. But between Fong Yu and Alpha, there\nare more than a dozen giant spiders.\nJust then, a silver light flew out of\nthe woods and suddenly struck the spider\nclosest to Alpha, pinning it firmly to\nthe snow. Fongu looked closely and\nrealized that it was an iron axe. Then,\na pale skeleton emerged from the woods.\nIts lion skeleton. The skeleton Ryan\nwalked a few steps to the nailed spider\ncorpse, pulled out an ax covered in\nspider blood, turned around, and\nprecisely cleaved the spider silk on\nAlfa's hind leg with one swing of the\naxe. In the instant he raised the ax, he\nalso cut the spider silk on Alpha's\nfront leg. The entire sequence of\nmovements was completed in the blink of\nan eye, flowing smoothly without a\nsingle superfluous motion, leaving Fong\nYu completely stunned. Then to Fong\nYu&lt;unk&gt;s even greater astonishment, the\nskeleton Ryan leaped into the swarm of\nspiders surrounding it. And then with a\nswift, powerful axe strike, he brought\nit down again and again. Just like\nchopping a watermelon, one axe blow will\nsurely take the life of a spider.\nWhenever a spider dies under the ax\nblade of skeleton Ryan, a stream of\nblack energy flows along the ax blade\nand into skeleton Ryan's skeleton. Fa\nwas completely stunned. Is this still\nthe same skeleton Ryan who seemed about\nto fall apart after just a few steps?\nThat's Ghost Rider. At this moment,\nValentina, who was floating behind Fong\nYu, looked at the skeleton Ryan, who was\nslaughtering everyone. Her eyes\nflickered slightly. She sighed softly\nand murmured, \"Sigh. Never mind. I'll\nstop pretending.\" After saying that, the\nfemale ghost suddenly looked up and her\nflowing black hair instantly turned\nsilver and fluttered up while her\noriginally brown pupils turned into a\ndark purple. Immediately, an invisible\nmental shock burst forth from the female\nghost. This mental shock selectively\nbypassed Fong Yu and swept across a\nlarge area of spiders. Those spiders\nthat were concentrated by this mental\nshock were all stunned and stood\nmotionless in place. The corpse dog\nAlpha in the distance glanced at the\nskeleton Ryan who was about to fall with\nhis ax and then at Valentina who was\nexuding an aura of power. A crimson\nlight began to flash in its eyes. The\nnext second, the corpse dog transformed\ninto a black shadow weaving through the\nspider swarm. Without even needing to\nbear its fangs, it simply smashed the\nskull of one spider with a single claw,\nthen moved on to the next. Soon, in less\nthan the time it takes to smoke a\ncigarette, all the hundreds of giant\nspiders around the cabin were killed on\nthe spot. Fong Yu, the victim of the\nattack, stared blankly at everything\nthat was happening. Skeleton Ryan pulled\nthe axe from the last spider corpse,\nturned and glanced at Fong Yu. At this\nmoment, a thin layer of fascia had\ncovered Skeleton Ryan's skeleton, and\nupon closer inspection, some pale muscle\ntissue could even be seen. The skeleton\nRyan's jawbone twitched and a simple\nsyllable escaped his lips. ABA aba aba\nFong Yu still in a daysaze mechanically\nturned his head and glanced at the\nskeleton Ryan. The skeleton gestured\nwildly saying aba aba aba. Fongu raised\nan eyebrow. Although he didn't know why\nthe skeleton could suddenly make sounds,\nhe still asked what did it say? It said\nit's too cold outside. Master, you\nshould go back first. I'll take care of\ncleaning this. Fongu glanced at the\nhundreds of spider corpses scattered\nacross the snow, then at the skeleton\nRyan carrying a blood dripping ax, the\ncorpse dog with glowing red eyes, and\nthe long-haired female ghost. After a\nmoment of silence, he turned and went\ninto the wooden house. Skeleton Ryan\nwalked up to the female ghost. ABA aba\naba. The corpse dog also trotted over\nand looked at the wooden house. The\nfemale ghost shook her head and said\nhelplessly, \"I don't know either. I'll\nexplain it to him when I get back.\" The\nskeleton nodded and turned to clean up\nthe insect corpses. The female ghost\nValentino waved slightly at the spider\ncorpses in the snow, and then she\nabsorbed wisps of soul power into her\nbody. The corpse dog alpha turned its\nhead to look into the woods and bared\nits teeth slightly. In the woods, the\nhuman-faced spider took one last look at\nthe wooden house before turning and\nretreating deeper into the forest.\nChapter 30, the showdown. Back in the\ncabin, Fongu glanced at his head and\nbody covered in spider blood and shook\nhis head helplessly. Sigh. I just took a\nshower and it was all for nothing. So,\nFong Yu boiled a few more kettles of hot\nwater, went to the bathroom, and mixed\nthe cold water from the bathtub with it\nto wipe his entire body again. Just\nthen, several sets of thermal underwear\nwere ready at the crafting station.\nFongu grabbed a set and changed out of\nhis blood soaked wild boar armor and\nclothes. Putting on the thermal\nunderwear, and I must say, this white\nthermal underwear made of spider silk is\nnot only very smooth to wear, but also\nprovides excellent warmth. He then sat\ndown by the fireplace, warming himself\nby the fire, and began to think, \"If\nwhat I just saw wasn't a hallucination,\nthen my three roommates, or rather my\npartners, all seemed to be very capable.\nBut why did they all behave so\nunremarkable before?\" Just as Fongu was\nwondering, the ghost Valentina passed\nthrough the wall and entered the house.\n\"Master,\" she called softly. Fongu\nlooked up at Valentina when he heard the\nsound. Master, are you wondering why we\nhid our abilities before? The female\nghost asked. Fongu nodded and replied. I\nam indeed a little curious. I didn't\nexpect you guys to be so capable. Why\ndidn't you show it sooner? That's\nbecause we haven't had a chance to show\noff before, the female ghost whispered.\nFongu raised an eyebrow. That was indeed\ntrue. Valentina had been staying indoors\nall the time and couldn't show up during\nthe day. If it weren't for the spider\nattack tonight, she wouldn't have had a\nchance to perform. As for skeleton Ryan,\nalthough it didn't seem very powerful\nbefore, the fact that it could chop so\nmuch wood in one night is actually quite\nimpressive when you think about it. As\nfor corpse dog Alpha, Alpha, why did\nAlpha and I look so ordinary when we\nwent hunting wild boar? And the same\nthing at the spider nest, just ordinary.\nWell, Valentina smiled. That's because\nit wants to give you, its owner, the\nchance to exercise, an opportunity to\ntrain. Valentina nodded. If we were to\neliminate all the dangers for you, then\nyou wouldn't be able to grow as a\nmaster. Although Fong Yu wanted to\nrefute it, he had to admit that the\nreason was quite valid. Although he is a\nlazy bum with no ambition, it doesn't\nmean he's willing to be a mama's boy who\nrelies on others for everything. Judging\nfrom the current situation, the three\ncompanions in the haunted house are\nactually much stronger than Fong Yu, and\nthe weakest one is actually the owner.\nThat's a bit unreasonable. However, the\nlast time in the spider forest, the\nmaster was ambushed and poisoned by that\nhuman-faced spider, which was indeed\nvery dangerous. That was Alpha's\nnegligence, and I have already\ncriticized it very seriously. He I can't\nblame him that time. It was my own\nnegligence. Fongu waved his hand and\nsaid frankly, \"You're right. We can't\nrely on you for everything. Otherwise,\nI'll just stay in the same place\nforever.\" \"Ghost Valentina's trust level\nplus 5. Current trust level 100. Ghost\nValentina has written to you as if you\nwere a friend.\" Looking at the prompt\nthat appeared in front of him, Fong Yu\nraised an eyebrow. He hadn't expected\nthat being honest with himself would\nactually increase trust. Sure enough,\nValentina's gaze softened as she looked\nat Fong Yu. She said gently, \"If you\never need Valentina's help in the\nfuture, please don't hesitate to ask,\nMaster.\" Funu thought for a moment. It\nseemed that the ghost Valentina couldn't\ngo out during the day, and he could\nmanage with the corpse dog Alpha during\nthe day. So, if he needed her help, it\ncould only be for things inside the\nhouse. But what could she possibly help\nwith inside the house? Laundry and\ncooking. I don't know if she's willing,\nbut she's a ghost, so she probably can't\ndo these things. But looking at\nValentina's eager eyes, Fong Yu felt\nembarrassed to refuse directly. So Fong\nYu simply said, \"In that case, the\nimportant task of looking after the\nhouse will be entrusted to you from now\non. If there's anything you can do to\nhelp out, please do so.\" Okay, no\nproblem. Valentina smiled sweetly. After\ntalking with the ghost, Valentina, Fong\nYu, exhausted both physically and\nmentally, returned to his bedroom, and\nfell asleep immediately. The next\nmorning, he was awakened by a rich\naroma. Ah, it smells so good. Fongu\nrubbed his eyes, sat up in bed, and\nsniffed carefully. He found the\nfragrance to be quite rich, and for a\nmoment, he couldn't quite make out what\nit was, but overall, it smells\ndelicious. Fong Yu drooled, quickly got\nout of bed, opened the bedroom door, and\nsaw an iron pot on the living room\ntable. The aroma was coming from the\niron pot. Fongu walked to the table and\nlooked into the pot. It looked like a\nthick soup similar to borched with an\norange red base and some green berry\nchunks, red mushroom chunks, and some\nmeat chunks floating on top. A pot of\npork and mushroom soup. A delicious soup\nthat increases sanity by 10, hunger by\n100, thirst by 100, and warms the body\nfor 1 hour. When your spirit value\nexceeds 100, a pleasure effect will be\ntriggered, increasing work efficiency\nand luck by 10%. Good heavens, increased\nsanity has such a good effect. Funu\nglanced at his mental value. Because he\nhad just woken up, his mental value was\nnow at 100 points, which meant that as\nlong as he ate this pork and mushroom\nsoup, he would get a pleasant effect.\nFong Yu also took a special look at the\nbody warming effect. Warming the body,\nsteaming hot soups can keep your body\nwarm for a while. What are we waiting\nfor? My stomach is already growling. But\nFongu suddenly realized a problem. I\ndidn't make my own utensils. Without\nutensils, it's really impossible to eat\nthis soupy food. You can't just scoop it\nout with your hands, can you? Thinking\nabout the table wear, Fong Yu suddenly\nrealized another problem. Who made this\npot of thick soup? It certainly couldn't\nhave been something I did while\nsleepwalking. And as for Alpha, the dog\nsleeping soundly under the table, it\nprobably didn't have that ability\neither. That means it could only be\neither skeleton Ryan or Ghost Valentina.\nRecalling his conversation with\nValentina the previous night, Fong Yu\nguessed that Valentina had most likely\nmade the soup. So Fong Yu walked to the\nworkbench and began making table wear,\ncalling out, Valentina. There was no\nresponse. Fong Yu looked up at the roof\nbeams, which were empty. Sigh, I still\ncan't go out during the day. Fong Yu\nsmiled slightly at the roof beam and\nsaid, \"Thank you for breakfast. Chapter\n31. Abandoned mine.\" The table wear was\nmade very quickly, all in 3 minutes. In\naddition to chopsticks, there were\nspoons, forks, and two bowls. The whole\nset only used one piece of wood, which\ncan be described as good quality and\ninexpensive. With the utensils in hand,\nFong Yu began to eat the mushroom and\npork soup, and also served a bowl to\nAlpha. While eating, Fong Yu discovered\nthat the tracksuit he had worn earlier\nhad been washed and was hanging by the\nfireplace to dry with a pair of wild\nboar armor that had been wiped clean\nhanging next to it. The spider carcass\nin the living room was gone. It must\nhave been thrown outside. The blood\nstains on the floor had been wiped\nclean, and everything was neat and tidy\nexcept for the broken chair placed in\nthe corner. Haha. Barring any unforeseen\ncircumstances, this should all be\nattributed to Valentina. I never\nimagined that Valentina could do so much\nafter we reached a trust level of 100.\nFong Yu then looked at the corner of the\nwall where the skeleton Ryan was sitting\nbecause there was a layer of fascia and\nmuscles on his skeleton, it did not fall\napart. The rusty iron axe lay beside it.\nFu took a special look at Ryan's name\nand found that it had changed from gray\nto white, indicating that it, like\nAlpha, had also been promoted to the\nnext level. Fu remembered Valentina\ntelling him that Ryan needed to absorb\nlife force to level up. If he remembered\ncorrectly, when a large group of spiders\nattacked the cabin last night, he killed\nmany spiders. He guessed that he must\nhave absorbed a lot of life force at\nthat time, which is why he leveled up.\nRecalling Ryan's fierce and invincible\nfigure wielding an iron ax among the\nspider swarms last night, Fongu felt\nthat Ryan must have been a very powerful\nwarrior in his previous life. Having\nsuch a powerful warrior as his partner\nmade Fongu feel at ease. After finishing\nbreakfast, Fongu went to the front door.\nAs soon as he opened it, a gust of\nbiting cold wind hit him, making him\nshiver. No, no, you should wear more\nclothes. So, Fongu put on his dried\ntracksuit and wild boar armor again\nbefore pushing open the door and going\nout. Looking around, everything was\ncovered in a blanket of white with a\nlayer of snow higher than knee deep\ncovering the open ground, completely\nerasing any trace of the battle that had\ntaken place the night before. However,\nthere was a small snow drift in the\ncenter of the open space. Fong Yu walked\nover and brushed away the snow with his\nhand and saw the spider corpse buried\ninside. These are all resources. We\ncan't waste them. So, Fong Yu began to\ndissect the spider corpses buried under\nthe snow hill one by one. An hour later,\nFong Yu finally finished collecting all\nthe spider corpses. He glanced at his\nbackpack. 212 spider fangs, 308 spider\nmeat, and 65 spider glands. Haha. But to\nbe honest, the hall this time was really\nbig, especially the more than 300 pieces\nof spider meat. Although he has wild\nboar meat to eat and wouldn't eat spider\nmeat that might cause diarrhea and\nweakness, he can still list it on the\nexchange to sell. Given the current\nfreezing weather outside, obtaining food\nis virtually impossible. So spider meat\nwill undoubtedly become a hot commodity.\nIn this way, he can make a profit from\nthe spider meat and also give players\nwho have no food a chance to survive,\nwhich is mutually beneficial. The\nwarming effect of the soup, had worn\noff. Fongu roughly assessed the outside\ntemperature, which was around -10° C.\nEven though he was wearing thermal\nunderwear, sportsware, and wild boar\narmor, he still felt the biting cold.\nThis means that it is almost impossible\nfor players without warm clothing to go\nout. Fanu glanced down at Alpha. The guy\nseemed perfectly normal, not cold at\nall. But considering that it seemed to\nhave demon blood, it shouldn't be so\neasily afraid of the cold, so he was\nrelieved. After walking the dog around\nthe cabin, Fongu noticed that the\nspiders had damaged a lot of the cabin's\nexterior walls, leaving many pitted and\nuneven areas. He also looked up at the\nthick snow on the roof and worried that\nit might collapse the cabin. So he\nopened the system interface and took a\nlook at the condition of the cabin.\nSpacious haunted house in the woods, one\nbedroom, one living room, one kitchen,\none bathroom, 40sqm durability 210300.\nRepair requires 25360/180\nwood, 12210/60\ngravel, 2820 mud. reparable. As\nexpected, it needed repairs, but\nfortunately, he had acquired a large\namount of resources by reselling red\nmushrooms, so the repair costs were\nnegligible. Direct repair. After the\nwooden house shook, the damaged parts of\nthe exterior wall were quickly repaired,\nand it looked brand new. The vibrations\ncaused by the maintenance also shook the\nsnow off the roof, saving Fongu the\ntrouble of climbing up to clear it.\nAfter repairing the cabin, Fu prepared\nto take a stroll around the area. But\nafter looking at the surrounding woods,\nhe was unsure which direction to go. The\nground was covered in kneedeep snow. If\nhe were to rashly enter the western wild\nboar forest, he would have a hard time\navoiding an adult wild boar. If he were\nto be hit, he would at least suffer a\nbroken bone. As for the spider forest to\nthe east, he was even less inclined to\ngo in. After all, that vengeful\nhuman-faced spider was still alive. And\nwho knew what kind of deadly trap it\nmight have set up for him in the forest.\nHe hadn't been to the woods to the south\nor north and didn't know what was\ninside. So, he decided to ask Alpha for\nhis opinion. Alpha, you can't keep\nhiding your true abilities like before.\nIf we encounter any danger, you'll have\nto show your real skills. Funu said\nseriously to the dog. Woof. The dog\nnodded, sticking out its tongue. Do you\nknow where there are other treasure\nchests hidden in the woods to the south\nand north? Funu asked. Upon hearing\nthis, the dog looked around, then stroed\nthrough the snow and ran towards the\nnorth side of the woods. Ah, having a\ndog that can find treasure is just\nawesome. Fongu followed the dog into the\nwoods to the north. There was much less\nsnow in the woods, so walking was\nrelatively smooth. The surroundings were\nalso very quiet with no other sounds\nexcept for the crunching sound of\nfootsteps on the snow. They didn't\nencounter any large animals along the\nway, but Alpha caught two snow hairs\nthat were out foraging for food. After\nwalking about 500 m through the woods,\nFong Yu and Alpha arrived at a mound\nabout five stories high. Guided by\nAlpha, Fong Yu discovered a huge dark\nhole at the bottom of the mound. Huh?\nWhere is this place? Fongu was startled\nand looked at Guzy asking, \"Don't tell\nme this is a bear den.\" The dog shook\nits head. At that moment, a prompt from\nthe game assistant appeared in the air.\n\"Abandon mine! This is a mine that has\nbeen abandoned for who knows how long,\nleading to a dark and sunless\nunderground world. Perhaps there are\nsome unmined ores inside, perhaps some\nunknown treasures, and perhaps some very\ndangerous monsters. Chapter 32, seven\nboxes. Looking at the dark entrance to\nthe mine, Fong Yu hesitated to go in or\nnot to go in. As the system notification\njust mentioned, there might indeed be\nores and treasures inside, but there\nmight also be monsters. Based on Fong\nYu's understanding of the game system,\nthis guy would never make a fuss without\nreason, which means there must be\nmonsters in this mine, and it's highly\nunlikely to be some giant beast or\ninsect. Who knows what that thing is?\nAlthough Fong Yu was very interested in\nthe treasure, he cared more about his\nlife. Just to be on the safe side, he\nasked Alpha beside him. \"Are there any\nmonsters in here?\" \"Woof!\" the honest\ndog nodded. And judging from its\nexpression, it seemed a little excited.\n\"Really? Why don't we go back?\" Fongu\nsaid sincerely. \"Actually, whether it's\na treasure chest or not, isn't that\nimportant?\" He had only planned to come\nout to digest his food and kill some\ntime and maybe see if there were any\nbargains he could find, but he was still\na little nervous about actually going\ninto such a deep abandoned mine. After\nall, this isn't the real world. Wild\nboores can grow to over 3 m long, and\nspiders can grow as big as millstones.\nWho knows what the monsters underground\nin the mines might look like? Therefore,\nFongu prepared to retreat. The dog\nlooked completely bewildered. No, boss.\nYou came all this way and you're already\nbacking out as soon as you get to the\ndoor. So, Alpha decided to encourage its\nowner. Woof woof. The dog shook its head\nand started jumping around in place.\nFunu raised an eyebrow, indicating that\nhe didn't understand. So, the dog\nstretched out its front paw and\nscratched at the tree trunk, leaving\nthree deep grooves. This time, Funu\nunderstood. You mean you're really\npowerful? You can take down those\nmonsters. Woof! The dog nodded. \"Yes,\nalthough this dog looks rather thin, it\nis after all a demon dog, and it\nperformed quite well when it fought the\nwild boar. Since that's the case,\" Fanu\nhesitated for a moment, then gritted his\nteeth and said, \"Fine, let's go in and\ntake a look. If it's not good, we'll\nleave. After all, if even a dog isn't\nafraid, surely the owner can't be less\ncourageous than a dog.\" So led by the\ndog, Fong Yu took out a torch, lit it,\nand followed them inside. Upon entering\nthe mine entrance, the first thing Fong\nYu saw was a rusty and corroded railway\ntrack that stretched deep into the mine.\nThree mining cars used for transporting\nminerals were parked on the track,\nsupported by wooden beams on the\nsurrounding rock walls. Due to years of\ndisrepair, these wooden beams were\nrotten to varying degrees and did not\nlook very sturdy. Won't it collapse?\nFongu was a little panicked. If it\nreally collapsed after he went in, he\nwould be trapped underground and there\nwould be no one to help him. However,\nbefore Fong Yu could react, he saw Alpha\ndash off into the depths of the mine.\nNo. Hey, slow down. Fongu had no choice\nbut to follow. After following the dog\ndeeper into the mine for more than 10 m,\nFong Yu discovered a wooden house ahead.\nHoly crap. Are there other players here?\nAnd why did they build their cabins\ninside the mine? That's some pretty\nflashy maneuvering. However, upon closer\ninspection, the walls of the wooden\nhouse were severely rotten with many\nparts completely decayed. Judging from\nthis condition, the house had been\nuninhabited for at least several years.\nEven if a player who has only been in\nthe game for a few days has built a\nwooden house, the house will be brand\nnew and would not be dilapidated like\nthis. Therefore, this wooden house must\nhave originally been inside this mine.\nUpon closer inspection, it's clear that\nthis mine was man-made, so it's quite\nnormal to have a wooden hut inside. At\nthis moment, Alfa had already run to the\nfront of the cabin and turned to call\nout to Fong Yu. Woof m is there\nsomething good inside. Fong Yu asked.\nThe dog nodded. Fongu grinned. It seemed\nhe had come to the right place. He went\nto the door and gently pushed open the\nwooden cabin door. However, the door had\nonly been opened halfway when it\nsuddenly collapsed. Boom! The wooden\ndoor fell down, kicking up a cloud of\ndust. Cough, cough, cough. Fong Yu took\ntwo steps back, looked up at the ancient\nwooden house again, and felt uneasy. If\nhe goes in by himself, won't the house\ncollapse? However, as Fong Yu looked\nthrough the collapsed gate, he saw a row\nof neatly stacked boxes inside the\nwooden house. Yes, he wasn't mistaken.\nIt wasn't just one box, but an entire\nrow. There were seven or eight of them\ndepend on the treasure chest is right in\nfront of you. Who could resist this?\nHowever, the cautious fong you first\ntried pushing the walls of the wooden\nhouse to make sure that the overall\nstructure of this old wooden house was\nstill sturdy before carefully walking\nin. The cabin was large. He looked\naround and saw four long wooden tables\ninside, but the legs of three of them\nhad rotted and broken and were lying on\nthe floor. On the only standing table\nwas a pickaxe and a miner's hat.\nHowever, both the pickaxe and the\nminer's hat were covered with a thick\nlayer of dust, indicating they were\nquite old. Judging from the appearance,\nthis wooden hunt must have been a\nresting place for the miners who used to\nwork here. In addition, there is another\ndoor inside the wooden house. However,\nFong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s attention was entirely\nfocused on the seven boxes. He walked\nstraight to one of the boxes, wiped off\nthe dust, and took a closer look. Good\nheavens, this box is actually made of\niron. However, the system did not\nindicate that it was a treasure chest.\nIn other words, this is just an ordinary\nbox, not a treasure chest as determined\nby the system. Well, if it's not a\ntreasure chest, it's not a treasure\nchest. I just hope there are some\nsupplies inside. Fong Yu then pushed\nopen the lid of the box and peered\ninside with anticipation. Result: It is\ncompletely empty. Holy crap. Are you\nkidding me? Fong Yu frowned, then turned\naround and went to the second box,\nopening the lid. It's still completely\nempty. you. So, he then opened the\nthird one. It's still empty. I refuse to\nbelieve it. The fourth one is empty. The\nfifth one is also. When they got to the\nsixth one, Fongu started to panic.\nPlease don't let it be empty again. This\ntime, Fongu opened the box and finally\nsaw that the huge box was piled with a\nlot of ore, so he quickly chose to pick\nit up. received 120 gravel, 50 coal, 30\niron ore. Phew, at least it's not empty\nanymore. Although it's not much, it's\nbetter than nothing. Fong Yu then opened\nthe seventh and last box with great\nanticipation. Received 60 salt peter, 30\nsulfur or 20 silver ore, 10 gold ore,\nfive mithil ore. Huh? Fong, you\nrecognize silver ore and gold ore. But\nwhat were these? Sulfur or salt peter\nand mithril ore. Then the game assistant\nsent a message. Sulfur ore can be\nsmelted into sulfur powder, an essential\nraw material for making gunpowder, and\ncan also be used to repel snakes,\ninsects, and rodents. Salt peter. It can\nbe smelted into salt peter powder, an\nessential raw material for making\ngunpowder, and can also be used to make\nice sellers. Huh. Gunpowder. Fong use\nlips curled up into a smile. Chapter 33.\nScenario mission. Rescue the minor\nghost. Looking at the sulfur, ore, and\nsalt peter in his backpack, Fong Yu's\neyes lit up with excitement because\nthese were the raw materials for making\ngunpowder. What is gunpowder? Gunpowder\nis the cornerstone of the development of\nmodern firearms. With gunpowder, he\ncould make some firearms. And with\nfirearms, his combat power would\nnaturally increase rapidly. Of course,\nwe can forget about firearms for now,\nbut we could give explosives a try.\nAlthough he wasn't a science student and\ndidn't know the specific synthesis\nmethod of explosives, the manufacturing\nstation had them. I just don't know if\nyou need to learn the blueprints before\nyou can make explosives. Then he glanced\nat the description of the Myithil or\nMyithil ore, a rare and mysterious or\nthat can be smelted into my ingots which\ncan be used to enchant items.\nEnchantment. If gunpowder is a product\nof technological civilization, then\nenchanting is undoubtedly a product of\nmagical civilization. How could these\ntwo diametrically opposed civilizations\ncoexist? Funu found it amazing, but then\nhe thought about it and realized that\nthere was a skeleton in the house who\nwas very good at wielding an axe, a\nfemale ghost who could sing, and a dog\nwith demonic blood squatting at his\nfeet. From this perspective, it seems\nreasonable to say that this world is a\nmagical civilization. I just don't know\nwhat kind of enchantments this\nenchanting function can actually\nenchant. I'll study it more carefully\nwhen I get back. As Fongu was examining\nthe items in his backpack, unbeknownst\nto him, a phantom suddenly emerged from\nthe door behind him. The corpse dog\nalpha spotted the phantom immediately,\nbared its fangs, and let out a low\ngrowl. Startled awake by the low growl,\nFong Yu turned around and followed the\ndog's gaze, only to discover that,\nwithout him noticing, a phantom figure\nwas floating behind him. Or rather, it's\na ghost. Fortunately, Fu had lived with\nthe three ghostly companions in the\nhaunted house for 3 days. And since he\nwas originally a supernatural novelist,\nhe was not frightened by the sudden\nappearance of the ghost. He merely\nfrowned slightly, took a step back, and\nthen carefully examined the ghost. The\nghost looked like a middle-aged man with\na thick beard, wearing a tattered mining\nsuit, and seemed confused. \"Who are\nyou?\" Fong Yu asked, pushing the torch\nforward with a fierce but weak tone.\n\"Who am I?\" the ghost uncle murmured\nmechanically. Then he turned to look at\nthe wooden house. When his gaze fell on\nthe pickaxe and minor's hat on the\ntable, his eyes finally lit up. \"Hi, I'm\na minor here. My name is Steve. Ah, I\nremember now.\" The ghost's emotions\ngradually became agitated and his eyes\nbegan to reen. What are you going to do?\nCalm down. Fongu tried to persuade the\nother party and while doing so, he\nquickly took out an iron axe from his\nbackpack. However, he wasn't sure if his\niron axe could hit the other person.\nHowever, the next second, the\nemotionally unstable ghost suddenly\nknelt on the ground. It's all my fault.\nI've ruined them. God, please forgive my\nsins. What's going on? Fongu was a\nlittle confused. The alpha at his feet\nalso retracted its fangs, looking\ncompletely bewildered. However, the\nghost ignored Fong Yu and continued to\nkneel on the ground, covering its face\nand weeping bitterly. This completely\nstumped Fong Yu. Why don't you go over\nand comfort him? But he was also afraid\nthat the ghost might suddenly attack and\nhurt people. So, the situation remained\ndeadlocked for a while. 3 minutes later,\nFong Yu finally got fed up with the\nghost's crying and said to it, \"All\nright, all right, stop crying. Just say\nwhat you want.\" Finally, Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s\nwords stopped the ghost from crying. He\nlooked up at Fong Yu and choked out,\n\"Please save my co-workers. You have\ntriggered a scenario quest. Save the\nsouls in the abandoned mine.\" Fongu\nraised an eyebrow slightly as he looked\nat the system notification that appeared\nin the air. I didn't expect there would\nbe a mission to take on. I wonder what\nthe rewards will be. Complete this\nscenario's quest to gain the friendship\nof the minor ghosts. Friendship? The\nfriendship of miners? Does gaining the\nfriendship of these miners mean they'll\nhelp you mine? That's right. Rescue the\nminor ghosts trapped underground and\nthey'll help you mine in the mine. Upon\nhearing this, Funu immediately perked\nup. First of all, it's obvious to anyone\nthat or is an indispensable resource in\nthis survival game. For example,\nupgrading houses, smelting weapons and\narmor, etc., all require various ores.\nBut for Fong Yu, a seasoned homebody,\nsending him to mine in a dark and gloomy\nmine was tantamount to taking his life.\nAt this moment, as long as he can\ncomplete this scenario task, he will\ngain the friendship of a group of miners\nwho will help him mine. No matter how\nyou look at it, this deal is a win-win\nsituation. Damn it, the bold get rich,\nthe timid starve. Cheers. Fongu slapped\nhis thigh and decided to take on the\ntask. So he said to the ghost kneeling\non the ground, \"No problem. I can help\nyou. You have accepted the scenario\nquest. Save the souls in the abandoned\nmine.\" Friendly reminder, the\nunderground world is dangerous. One\nwrong move and you could become one of\nthose miners who perished. Is it really\nmeaningful for you to offer this\nhindsight advice? You didn't ask. Fongu\ntook a deep breath, composed himself,\nand said to the ghost kneeling on the\nground, \"You asked me to help you save\nyour co-workers, so you have to tell me\nwhat exactly happened first, right?\"\nUpon hearing this, Steve immediately\nlooked up with delight and said, \"Here's\nwhat happened.\" It turns out that Steve\nand his fellow workers were villagers\nfrom a nearby town. By chance, they\ndiscovered a precious gold vein here.\nSo, they came together to build this\nmine. Everything was going smoothly.\nThey not only found a gold mine, but\nalso an incredibly valuable Myithil\nmine. Just as they were excitedly\nspeeding up their digging, thinking they\nwere about to reach the pinnacle of\ntheir lives, an accident occurred. The\nexplosives they used for blasting\nactually blew up a passage to the\nunderground world. In the eerie\nunderground world dwells an incredibly\nterrifying monster. The sound of the\nexplosives immediately attracted the\nmonster's attention, and the monster\nquickly rushed into the mine through the\nblasted passage. So, Steve and his\nfellow miners who hadn't had time to\nevacuate were attacked by monsters. In\nthe end, thanks to his miners selfless\nprotection, only Steve managed to escape\nfrom the mine. The monsters of the\nunderground world are about to crawl out\nof the mine and onto the surface. Once\nthey do, it will undoubtedly be a\nterrible disaster for the nearby human\ntowns. So, after much hesitation, Steve\nfinally decided to use explosives to\ndestroy the entrance to the tunnel,\nsealing the underground monsters\nforever. But as a result, his fellow\nworkers were also buried forever in the\nunderground tunnels where the sun never\nshines, their souls never finding\nrelease. Steve overwhelmed by guilt and\nashamed to face his co-workers families\nchose to commit suicide. Tsk tsk this\nreally is a tragedy. After hearing the\nstory, Fongu shook his head and sighed.\nChapter 34. Manufacturing gunpowder.\nTherefore, I implore you to help me\nreopen the sealed tunnels and save the\nsouls of my poor fellow workers. Ghost\nSteve knelt down before Fong Yu once\nmore. Fong Yu pondered for a moment and\nasked, \"Didn't you say there are\nmonsters from underground in that\ntunnel? What if I open the tunnel and\nthose monsters come out again?\" Ghost\nSteve shook his head and replied, \"That\nwas many years ago. Those monsters have\nlong since returned to the underworld\nand disappeared for many years.\" Hearing\nSteve's words, Fongu felt relieved. But\nthen he asked curiously, \"Aren't you all\nghosts now? Why can't you pass through\nthose rocks or mud and come out on your\nown?\" Steve shook his head and said, \"We\ncan't stray too far from our own remains\nor we'll dissipate quickly.\" \"I see.\"\nFunu suddenly realized now that he had\naccepted the mission and taken so much\nor from the box. Fong Yu, as the saying\ngoes, \"He who takes a bribe is bound to\nbe grateful,\" no longer hesitated and\nhad ghost Steve lead the way to the\nentrance to the underground mine. At\nthis moment, the entrance was buried\nunder a pile of collapsed rubble. Fong\nYu came to the rubble and the game\nassistants prompt appeared again. Should\nwe pick up the gravel? Of course, I'll\npick it up. As Fong Yu picked up the\nstones, he quickly collected all the\nrubble piled up at the cave entrance\ninto his backpack. You have obtained 156\npieces of rubble. After clearing away\nthe rubble, a huge square boulder\nappeared in front of Fong Yu, but the\nsystem did not prompt him to collect it.\nLooks like we'll have to dig it out. So\nFong Yu returned to the cabin, retrieved\nthe iron pickaxe from the table, and\nbegan to mine the boulder. One, two.\nHowever, it took Fong Yu a full 100\nswings of his pickaxe before a single\ncrack appeared on the boulder in front\nof him. Exhausted, Fong Yu threw down\nthe pickaxe and sat on the ground,\npanting. No, this is way too damn hard\nto dig. Mining is different from cutting\ndown trees. When you use a pickaxe to\nmine, you have to endure the recoil\nforce caused by the impact of the\npickaxe with the ore. After only 100\nstrikes, the web between Fongu's thumbs\nand index fingers was already sore from\nthe impact. Is there a more time-saving\nand laborsaving method? Fong Yu then\nrecalled how miners usually quarried\nrocks. Besides digging with pickaxes,\nthey also used blasting. Yes, blow it\nopen with gunpowder. Fong Yu slapped his\nforehead and stood up from the ground.\nDidn't I just get sulfur or salt Peter\nor from the box? We should be able to\nmake gunpowder now. Fong Yu then\nprepared to return to the cabin to make\ngunpowder. He explained his idea to\nGhost Steve, who nodded in agreement.\nThe workbench here is rotten and\nunusable, so I'll have to trouble you to\ngo back and make gunpowder, but I think\nyou'll need something. So, come with me.\nSo Fongu followed Steve back to the\ncabin where Steve led him to the inner\nroom. There are 10 beds inside and on\none of them lies a skeleton dressed in\nminer's clothes. \"Is this you?\" Funu\nasked, looking at the skeleton. Steve\nnodded, then pointed to the pocket of\nthe skeleton miner's suit and said, \"The\nrecipe for gunpowder is inside.\" Upon\nhearing this, Fong Yu walked over,\nopened the pocket on the skeleton's\nbody, and took out a yellowed parchment.\nobtained simple explosive pack making\nrecipe available for learning. He he\nFunu smiled slightly as he looked at the\nparchment in his hand. Almost forgot\nmaking gunpowder alone isn't enough. We\nalso need to make explosive charges. So\nFong Yu chose to study and the parchment\nin his hand turned into ashes and\ndisappeared. After learning how to make\na simple explosive pack, Fongu bid\nfarewell to Go Steve and returned to his\ncabin through the woods. On the way\nback, looking at the desolate\nsnow-covered landscape around him, Fongu\ncouldn't help but think that it would be\ngood to complete the minecene mission\nwhile the weather was so awful. Back in\nthe cabin, Fongu couldn't wait to go to\nthe workbench and begin studying how to\nmake gunpowder. Gunpowder making\nrequirements: six salt peter, two\ncharcoal or coal, one sulfur. Sulfur\npowder produced by smelting sulfur or\none part sulfur or can produce one part\nsulfur powder. requirements for making a\nsimple explosive charge, two gunpowder,\none flax. Funu then glanced at the\nbackpack and the warehouse. He has 30\nparts sulfur or 60 parts salt peter and\n70 parts coal. If calculated\nproportionally, he is 120 parts short of\nsalt peter to make 30 parts of\ngunpowder. With 30 parts of gunpowder,\nhe can make 15 simple explosive packs.\nThis thing can be used to blast rocks,\nand it's also quite powerful as a\nweapon. So naturally, the more the\nbetter. So Fongu opened the exchange and\nbegan to look for salt peter for\nconsignment. This stuff actually has\nvery limited uses. Apart from making\ngunpowder, the only other use is for\nmaking ice kills. In the dead of winter,\nno players will be building ice sellers.\nSo there's still plenty of salt peter in\nthe exchange, and it's not expensive.\nYou can exchange one berry for one piece\nand one piece of meat for 10 pieces.\nFong Yu didn't haggle and directly\nexchange 12 portions of spider meat for\n120 portions of salt peter. Since the\nother party didn't specify what kind of\nmeat to use, we'll use spider meat if we\ncan. After the transaction was\ncompleted, Fong Yu began to put 30\nportions of sulfur or into the forging\nfurnace for smelting. Sulfur or smelting\nin progress. 149 minutes and 58 seconds\nremaining. it's taking this long? Funu\nthought for a moment and decided to\nbuild another forging furnace. Anyway,\nthe house was bigger after the upgrade,\nso there was plenty of room to put it\nthere. Forging furnace crafting\nrequirements 246/20\ncrushed stone, 10/10 coal or charcoal\ncan be manufactured. After completing\nthe second forging furnace, Fongu placed\nthe two furnaces together and then\ndivided the sulfur ore into two portions\nfor remelting. For a moment, the smoke\nbillowing from the forging furnace made\nFong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s eyes water, and the whole\nroom was filled with smoke. He had no\nchoice but to open the door to let in\nsome fresh air. Although the cold wind\noutside was biting, it was still better\nthan getting poisoned while cooped up\nindoors. It was almost noon, and Fong\nYu, who was waiting for the sulfur to be\nsmelted, had nothing to do. He hadn't\nfinished the mushroom and pork soup from\nbreakfast, so he simply put it in the\nfireplace to reheat it. Taking advantage\nof this time, he opened the regional\nchat channel, ready to see how other\nplayers were spending the first day of\nwinter. As soon as he opened the chat\nchannel, he noticed the number of\nplayers listed. 7,585\npeople. TSKTSK. Quite a few people have\ndied again. Chapter 35. Frenzy at the\nexchange for thermal underwear and\nspider meat. More than a thousand people\nhave died again. Fong Yu shook his head\nhelplessly, feeling a sense of\nmelancholy, like a rabbit mourning the\ndeath of a fox. After all, those are all\nliving, breathing human lives. And isn't\nthis survival game way too difficult?\nAlmost a quarter of the players have\ndied in just 3 days. If they die in\nanother 10 days or half a month, won't\nthey all be dead? Feeling a bit down,\nFongu looked at the chat channel,\nwanting to see how other players were\ndoing during the winter. Yao Jiwin ID\n357. Holy crap, it's so cold outside. I\nonly wore my underwear when I entered\nthe game, and now I'm huddled by the\nfireplace, shivering. Wu Bao Xang,\nMe too. I entered the game while taking\na shower without even my underwear. Li\nChong Leang, ID888.\nWu Baoang, ID7876.\nBro, you're awesome. So, you've been\nwalking the bird for 3 days. Liak Kai ID\n1573 Wu Bao Xang ID7876.\nBro, are you stupid? You can make\nclothes with linen. I've listed a lot of\nlinen on the exchange. Go buy some. Shin\nXiaoyu ID9. Uggh, I'm so hungry. There's\nnowhere to eat outside. I only have two\nberries left and that'll be all I have.\nXiao Yini ID99. The berry bushes near me\nare also covered by snow, but I still\nhave some berries stored up. I'll put\nsome up for sale for you, but I'm almost\nout of wood. Will any of you trade wood\nfor berries with me? Lie Chong Leang\nID888 Xiao Yini ID99.\nMe.\nMiss, please put some berries on the\nshelves quickly. My hunger level is\nalmost at zero. Shinfe\n519, could some kind soul please put\nsome cheap food up for sale? I'm\nstarving. Zangers ID 1213. Heihei, why\ndidn't you guys collect food properly\nfor the first 3 days? Didn't that expert\nFong You share a method for killing wild\nboores with red mushrooms? How come you\ndidn't have any food? Xiao Ming ID211.\nThat's not entirely true. Not everyone's\nspawn point has wild boars nearby. Near\nmy house, there was only a group of wild\nyaks that were about the size of\nelephants. I couldn't even hide from\nthem. Leakai ID 1573. Just a quick ad.\nAnyone want linen clothes? I've put them\nup for sale. Those of you who don't have\nclothes to wear, hurry and buy them.\nThey'll be gone before they're gone.\nIt's best to trade food for them. Thank\nyou everyone. Lein Long ID2 Leakai ID\n1573. Me. I'll trade you a piece of meat\nfor your clothes. Songing ID 3533.\nLiakai ID 1573. I want one too. Liakai\nID 1573. No rush. No rush. Auction now.\nA linen outfit for 20 berries or two\npieces of meat or 40 pieces of wood. Wu\nJingia ID 757. Holy crap. Liakai ID\n1573. You're really ruthless. Leang\nYuchi ID 331. Exactly. So expensive. Who\ncan afford it? Lin Shaon. ID 1573.\nHumph. This kind of unscrupulous\nbusinessman should die sooner. Liak Kai\nID 1573. Take it or leave it. Only five\nsets available. First come, first\nserved. Fa glanced through the list and\nfound that the players were currently\nmost lacking in two things: food and\nwarm clothing. As for food, since many\nplayers have used red mushrooms to hunt\nwild boores, the overall price of food\nis not very high, remaining at around 15\nwood for one piece of meat, which is\nequivalent to exchanging 1.5 trees for\none piece of meat. It probably only\ntakes about half an hour to cut down one\nand a half trees. And in return, you can\nget a piece of meat that will keep you\nfull for half a day. So, it's still a\ngood deal. Even in this freezing\nweather, going out to cut down trees is\nnot an easy task. Without warm clothing,\nit is easy to suffer from hypothermia\nand frostbite or even freeze to death.\nHe had also seen the production cost of\na set of linen clothing which only\nrequired four units of linen yet that\nLeakai was selling it for the exorbitant\nprice of 40 units of wood. This was\nundoubtedly price gouging, an attempt to\nmake a fortune off the spot. However,\nFong Yu himself had actually made a\nfortune by buying low and selling high\nthrough the exchange before, so he\nwouldn't go so far as to slander others.\nAfter all, earning survival resources\nthrough commercial activities is also a\nway to survive. Funu thought for a\nmoment and realized that he had 24 sets\nof thermal underwear made of spider silk\nin his warehouse. He decided to list\nthem on the exchange for consignment. As\nfor the price, he decided to price it\nthe same as the linen clothes. It was a\nbit expensive, but his thermal underwear\nwas much more cost effective than those\nlinen clothes, and the cost was also\nhigher. After all, spider silk is not an\neasy material to obtain, so the price\nwas reasonable. Most importantly, this\nis a genuine thermal underwear, and its\nwarmth retention is much better than\nthat of linen clothing. So, Fong Yu also\nposted an advertisement in the chat\nchannel. Fong UID00006.\nI will be listing 24 sets of thermal\nunderwear soon. You can check the\nattributes by clicking on the item name.\nI won't be auctioning them. The price\nwill be two pieces of meat or other\nitems of equivalent value. Let's see who\ncan grab them first. Upon hearing this,\nthe players who had been scrambling to\nauction off the linen clothes\nimmediately shifted their attention and\nbegan discussing it in the chat channel.\nZang Ursian ID 1213. Oh my god, there\nare thermal underwear. How come I didn't\nknow that? Zhao Ming ID211. I've wanted\nto make these thermal underwear for a\nlong time, but I couldn't get any\ncobwebs. This Fong Yu is amazing. He\nactually made 24 sets. Lie ID212. I\nchecked the stats and the warmth is much\nbetter than the linen coat. Plus, the\nprice isn't expensive. Fong Yu ID006.\nBoss, hurry up and list it on the\nexchange. I'm ready to snatch it. Song\njamming. ID 3533. Fong Yu ID006.\nHurry, hurry, hurry. I can't wait. I'm\nfreezing to death. Looking at the eager\nplayers in the chat channel, Fong Yu\nsmiled helplessly and began to list the\n24 sets of thermal underwear one by one\non the auction house, exchanging them\nfor materials needed to upgrade the\nwooden house. All 24 thermal underwear\nsets were sold out instantly upon being\nput on the shelves. Players who managed\nto snag the thermal underwear started\nshowing off in the chat channel while\nthose who missed out complained and\nurged Fong Yu to quickly make more\nthermal underwear sets to put on the\nshelves. Fong Yu could only respond with\na helpless remark. Fong Yu ID006. Sorry\neveryone, I've used up all the spiderw\nwebs I had. However, I still have 300\npieces of spider meat, which I'll put up\nfor sale later at five wood per piece.\nConsider it a giveaway. Let's see who's\nquick. The atmosphere in the chat\nchannel became lively again. Many\nplayers who had eaten spider meat before\nsaid that the meat tasted excellent and\nwas crunchy after being roasted.\nAlthough it might cause diarrhea and\nweakness, the probability was only about\n1/3 and the symptoms were not too\nserious, so it was not a big problem.\nThe key point is that spider meat is\nmuch cheaper than regular meat. But the\nincrease in satiety is the same, which\nis undoubtedly a great thing for players\nwho are short of money but still need to\nfill their stomachs. Compared to thermal\nunderwear, players obviously have a\nhigher need for food, especially meat.\nAfter all, as long as you lean against\nthe fireplace, you can barely survive\nwithout thermal underwear. But if you\ndon't have food, you'll die once your\nhunger level drops to zero. So the\nplayers in the chat channel started\nurging Fong Yu to quickly list the\nspider meat on the exchange. So Fong Yu\nstarted listing spider meat on the\nexchange piece by piece and many players\nwho couldn't afford pork went crazy for\nit. Almost every piece that was listed\nwas snapped up instantly. Seeing the\nspider meat sold out instantly as soon\nas it hit the shelves. Funu sighed with\na ry smile. It seems there are still\nmany people who can't afford ordinary\nmeat. Fongu put the items on the shelves\none by one to prevent people from buying\nup and hoarding them, which would defeat\nthe purpose of giving away freebies.\nFongu sold it cheaply because he wanted\nto reduce the number of deaths in\nDistrict 6. Those who were willing to\nbuy spider meat, apart from a few\nglutton with strong tastes, were mostly\npoor players who were short of resources\nand had to be careful with their money.\nOnly these poor players would be willing\nto gamble on the one-third chance of\ndiarrhea in exchange for satiety. So, if\na piece of spider meat can save one\nlife, then 300 pieces can save 300\nlives. Even if only a 100 or so people\nare saved, it still helps preserve some\nof the living forces in District 6. Yes,\nFongu wasn't a selfless philanthropist.\nUltimately, he was still thinking about\nthe server rankings after the merge in\n13 days and making preparations early.\nCurrently, through selling wild bore\nmeat and reselling red mushrooms, Fongu\nhas accumulated resources worth\napproximately 30,000 wood coins. So,\nusing this spider meat as a form of\nwelfare is not a problem. More\nimportantly, through this operation, the\nplayers in the chat channel who managed\nto snag the spider meat all expressed\ntheir gratitude to Fong Yu. Coupled with\nFong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s previous sharing of the\nmethod of hunting wild boores with red\nmushrooms, Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s influence and\nstatus among the players in zone 6\ngradually increased. Although Fong Yu\nhad little interest in power and status,\nit was always good to make good\nconnections. Chapter 36. Gaining the\nfriendship of the minor ghosts. After\nall the thermal underwear and spider\nmeat listed on Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s exchange\nwere snapped up, he tallied his profits\nand then glanced at the materials needed\nfor the next upgrade of the wooden\nhouse. Spacious forest haunted house,\none star, one bedroom, one living room,\none kitchen, one bathroom, 40sqm.\nSpacious forest haunted house, two star,\ntwo bedrooms, one living room, one\nkitchen, one bathroom, 60sqm.\nUpgrade requirements: wood 18163/1000\ngravel 8256/500\nmud 2200/100\n550th iron ingots vines 410/200\ncannot be upgraded to be honest.\nAlthough Fongu has plenty of resources\nnow, he still needs quite a lot of\nupgrade materials. 1,000 pieces of wood\nis equivalent to 100 trees. For a normal\nplayer using an iron axe, it would\nprobably take 5 days to gather just\nthose 100 trees. Add in materials like\ngravel, mud, iron ingots, and vines, and\nit would probably take more than 10 days\nto gather them. Upgrading a house is\nactually not a simple task. Aside from a\nshortage of iron ingots, Fun Yu had\nenough of everything else. He bought 100\niron ore from the exchange and put them\ninto the forge. Iron ore wasn't\nexpensive right now, only about 10\npieces of wood each. Since most players\nhouses were still at the lowest level of\nwooden huts, they didn't need iron\ningots for upgrades. They mostly just\nmade tools and weapons like iron\npickaxes, iron axes, and iron swords.\nSo, the demand for iron ingots wasn't\nhigh. Fong Yu looked up and glanced at\nthe wooden house and found that all the\nstructural reinforcements were basically\nmade of riveting and rot tan. If he was\nnot mistaken, the iron ingots were used\nto make iron nails to reinforce the\nhouse. However, constantly buying or\nfrom the exchange doesn't seem like a\nlong-term solution. Upgrading houses and\ncrafting weapons and equipment will\ndefinitely require a lot of iron ingots.\nTo obtain iron or stably in the long\nterm, one has to go to the mines. Funu\njust happened to find one. But the mine\nwas haunted and the way down was\nblocked. So the most urgent task is to\nmake the explosives, blast away the\nrocks blocking the mine for that ghost,\nSteve, and rescue the souls of his\nfellow miners. Then he can gain the\nfriendship of the ghost miners and a\nfully automated mining tunnel. Wouldn't\nall sorts of ores then flow into our\npockets like water, instantly achieving\nfinancial freedom? Wow, just thinking\nabout it makes me a little excited.\nAfter finishing his meal and watching\nthe chat channel, Fongu took a short\nnap. When he woke up, all the sulfur\npowder in the forging furnace had been\nburned, so he began to make gunpowder.\nGunpowder production requirements: 180/6\nsalt peter, 75 halves charcoal or coal,\n30 to one sulfur. It can make 30\nportions of gunpowder. Make it.\nGunpowder is being made. Time remaining.\n2 minutes 57 seconds. 3 minutes later,\nFong Yu continued to make a simple\nexplosive charge using the gunpowder he\nhad prepared. Simple explosive pack\ncrafting requirements. 30s gunpowder 161\nflax can be crafted. Make it. Simple\nexplosive charge 15 is being made. Time\nremaining 14 minutes and 57 seconds.\nAfter waiting another 15 minutes, Fong\nYu finally obtained 15 pre-made\nmakeshift explosive packs and then took\nthe corpse dog Alpha to the mine. As\nsoon as Fong Yu entered the mine, he saw\nGhost Steve, who was eagerly waiting for\nhim. \"Is the makeshift explosive charge\nready?\" Steve asked. Without wasting\nwords, Fun Yu pulled a bomb from his\nbackpack and waved it in front of Steve,\nsaying, \"I made 15 of them. I don't know\nif that's enough.\" Upon hearing this,\nSteve was overjoyed and nodded\nrepeatedly, saying, \"That's enough.\nThat's enough. That's more than enough.\"\nFong Yu and Steve then arrived at the\ngiant rock blocking the mine tunnel.\nUnder Steve's guidance, they placed the\nexplosive charge into the crack that\nFong Yu had previously chiseled out.\nFong Yu then lit the fuse with a torch\nand moved far away. With a deafening\nroar, stone chips flew everywhere and\ndust billowed up. Cough, cough, cough.\nCaught off guard, Fong Yu coughed\nrepeatedly from the smoke and dust.\nAfter the smoke settled, he looked at\nthe rock and found that the huge rock\nhad been blasted into several pieces,\nbut half of it was still blocking the\nmine tunnel and the entrance. So, he\nused the same trick again and placed a\nsecond pack of explosives. After another\nearth-shaking tremor, the rocks blocking\nthe mine tunnel were finally blasted to\npieces. Looking at the rubble scattered\non the ground, Fongu happily picked it\nup. Received 122 pieces of gravel. At\nthe same time, several figures dressed\nin miners clothes emerged from the still\nsettled dust. Johnny, Bill, Bob, you're\nfinally out. Ghost Steve, who was next\nto Fong You, rushed over immediately.\nHarah, yes, Steve. We're finally out.\nOne of the ghosts replied with a laugh.\nAt that moment, Steve knelt down before\nthe ghosts, choking back tears, and\nsaid, \"I'm so sorry. I've kept you\ntrapped in this dark and hopeless\nunderground for so long.\" One of the\nghosts stepped forward and helped Steve\nup, comforting him. Didn't we tell you\nbefore? You did the right thing. Any one\nof us would have done the same. We're\nwilling to sacrifice ourselves for our\nhome. At this moment, Steve remembered\nsomething, turned his head, and pointed\nat Fong Yu, saying, \"Thanks to this\ngentleman, it was his explosives that\nsaved you.\" Upon hearing this, the\nghosts all turned to look at Fong Yu.\nFong Yu, who was picking up pebbles at\nthe cave entrance, suddenly felt a\ntightness in his anus. To be honest,\nalthough he had written about countless\nterrifying ghosts and monsters, this was\nthe first time he had been stared at by\nso many dead ghosts at the same time.\nSo, he felt a little uneasy, just like\nLord Ye who loved dragons, but was\nafraid of seeing a real dragon. However,\nthese ghosts meant no harm to Fong Yu\nand did not appear terrifying. Apart\nfrom being semi-transparent wandering\nspirits, they looked no different from\nreal people. These ghosts came to Fong\nYu and expressed their heartfelt\ngratitude to him. \"He, I'm very happy to\nhave rescued you all,\" Fong Yu said with\na smile, scratching his head. \"Of\ncourse, I'm happy to be able to complete\nthe scenario task.\" After a brief\ndiscussion, the ghosts had Steve speak\nup, saying, \"We are very grateful for\nyour generous rescue. Is there anything\nwe can do for you? It's here. The\nmission reward is here.\" Although Fong\nYu already knew the mission rewards from\nthe game assistant, he still smiled\nslightly and asked, \"So, what can you\ndo?\" Steve paused for a moment, then\nturned to discuss it with his co-workers\nbefore saying to Fong Yu. In return, we\ncan mine minerals for you for a year.\nYou have gained the friendship of the\nminor ghosts who will mine for you for a\nyear. A year? Fongu raised an eyebrow,\nhis heart filled with joy. But then he\nrealized that a quarter in this game\nonly lasts 3 days and a year only seems\nto last 12 days. Sigh. 12 days it is.\nOne shouldn't be too greedy. So Fongu\nnodded and agreed. Then Steve said, \"We\nhave another request.\" Fongu nodded and\nsaid, \"Please speak freely. When the\nyear is up, we hope you will find our\ntown and let the priest there take our\nremains back for burial so that we can\nrest in peace.\" Town. Fong Yu then\nrealized that this world wasn't just\ninhabited by players like himself. There\nwere also natives, or you could call\nthem NPCs. To be honest, Steve's request\nwas not excessive and was quite\nreasonable. So, Fongu agreed again. You\nhave triggered a follow-up quest for\nthis scenario. Find Yorktown. Woohoo!\nThere's actually a follow-up mission.\nFongu raised an eyebrow and asked the\ngame assistant directly in his mind,\n\"What are the mission rewards? All you\nknow is rewards. isn't helping these\nghosts rest in peace of reward for your\nhumanity. Fongu shook his head, both\namused and exasperated. This game\nassistant was truly ruthless when it\ncame to roasting people. But it was also\nright. If these ghosts really helped him\nmine for a year, then it was only right\nto help them fulfill their final wish\nand let them rest in peace. However, the\nworker's pickaxes have all been lost in\nthe underground world. Could you please\nmake some for us? Steve said, \"Of\ncourse, no problem. We'll soon be able\nto harvest a batch of experienced minor\nghosts who don't need to eat or drink.\nGetting a few iron pickaxes is a piece\nof cake.\" So, Fong, you returned to the\nwooden house to prepare to make an iron\npickaxe. Iron pickaxe crafting\nrequirements 0/3 iron ingots 18163 to\none wood cannot be crafted. Funuide he\nstill had to forge iron ingots first.\nFortunately, he had bought 100 iron ore\nfrom the exchange and put them in the\nforging furnace to smelt. The smelting\nwas now complete, so he took them all\nout and brought them to the crafting\ntable to make 33 iron pickaxes in one\ngo. There are 10 minor ghosts in total.\nEach ghost should have three iron\npickaxes, which should be enough for a\nyear. In the blink of an eye, only 10 of\nthe 100 iron ingots that had just been\nsmelted were left. Helpless, Fong Yu had\nno choice but to buy another 100 iron\nore from the exchange and throw them\ninto the forging furnace to smelt. He\nalso added some wood fuel to the forging\nfurnace. Looking at the two forging\nfurnaces billowing thick smoke, Fong Yu\ncouldn't help but frown. The thick smoke\nfilled the entire room with a smoky\natmosphere which was really hard to\nexplain. So Fong Yu started to consider\nmoving the forging furnace into the\nmine. But then he thought that instead\nof moving it, he might as well build a\nfew and put them in the mine. And there\nwas also a crafting table so that he\nwouldn't have to keep running back and\nforth. By the time all 30 pickaxes were\nfinished, it was already evening. Fong\nYu used the last 30 minutes before dark\nto deliver the pickaxes to the ghost\nminers and set up five forging furnaces\nin the mine. I wonder how much mineral\nthose minor ghosts will dig out for\nthemselves this year. With this hope in\nmind, Fong Yu under the cover of Alpha\nreturned to the cabin before nightfall.\nChapter 37. Surrounded by enemies on all\nsides, a multitude of races stand\ntogether. Nightfalls. Ah. The first day\nof winter is finally over. Back in the\ncabin, Fong Yu, exhausted from a day's\nwork, took off his wild boar armor and\ncollapsed onto his newly made leather\nsofa. He discovered the crafting method\nfor this sofa by chance. while browsing\nthe crafting interface. The crafting\nrequirements are five animal hides, five\nlinen, five cotton, and five wood.\nConsidering that sitting on a wooden\nchair in winter would be too cold for my\nbottom. And since I had all the\nmaterials except cotton, I went to the\nexchange to exchange for these materials\nand made this sofa. These materials are\nexpensive for players who are still\nstruggling to make ends meet. But for\nFong Yu, they are just a piece of cake.\nMoreover, he not only made a sofa, but\nalso made a down comforter from the\nfeathers in the warehouse and a scarf\nand ear muffs from rabbit fur. With\nthese coldresistant items, he was\nfinally able to get a warm night's\nsleep. After all, according to Moslo's\nhierarchy of needs, once people have\nsatisfied their most basic physiological\nand safety needs, the next step is\nemotional needs. Of course, emotional\nneeds are not limited to romantic love,\nand he doesn't have that in mind right\nnow. However, improving one's living\nconditions and achieving a happy mood\nand physical comfort is also a form of\nself-satisfaction. The next level of\npursuit is the affirmation of intrinsic\nvalue and the recognition of external\nachievements. The scenes of showing off\nand getting slapped in the face in\nnovels are meant to satisfy this kind of\nspiritual pursuit for readers. Besides\nthe way of gaining spiritual\nsatisfaction by belittling others, which\ninvolves showing off and slapping them\nin the face, another way is to realize\none's social value. For example, Fong\nYu's act of consigning affordable spider\nmeat and thermal underwear on the\nexchange, as well as sharing some\nhunting techniques with other players\nnaturally earns him praise and even\nrespect from other players, which is a\nmanifestation of his selfworth. When it\ncomes to realizing his self-worth, Fong\nYu discovered that the chat channel went\ncrazy after he consigned 24 sets of\nthermal underwear and 300 pieces of\nspider meat. Almost all the players in\nzone 6 were going crazy for Fong Yu.\nSome praised him, some were envious,\nsome asked how he got so much spider\nsilk and spider meat, and some who\nhadn't managed to get thermal underwear\nor spider meat asked Fong Yu if he had\nany more. Of course, some envious\nplayers also criticized him for being\nheartless and greedy and for taking\nadvantage of the situation to make a\nfortune. In short, a notification would\npop up in the chat channel almost every\nnow and then, that someone was there.\nFunu helplessly realized that he had\ninadvertently become a celebrity in\nDistrict 6. To keep quiet, Fong Yu had\nto mute the system notification sounds\nand ignored everyone. Fong Yu had\noriginally planned to cook dinner\nhimself, but when he entered the\nkitchen, he saw Valentina cooking\nsomething in an iron pot. Thinking of\nthe delicious pork and mushroom soup he\nhad eaten during the day, Fong Yu handed\nover the responsibility of cooking\ndinner to Valentina and chatted with her\nabout the ghosts he had encountered in\nthe mine. When Valentina heard that Fong\nYu was going to help the ghosts find\ntheir home, Yorktown, she sighed\nslightly and said to Fong Yu, \"Master,\ntheir last wish may not be fulfilled.\"\n\"Huh? What do you mean?\" Fongu asked,\nsomewhat surprised. Valentina used her\nmental power to stir the food in the pot\nwith a wooden spoon as she said, \"I know\nthat mine. The miners inside have been\ndead for almost 100 years, and the town\nof York was destroyed by a dragon\nshortly after their deaths. A dragon\nattack destroyed. Funu raised an\neyebrow. A giant dragon. And it's an\nevil dragon that will destroy human\ntowns. Most importantly, Yorktown should\nnot be far from here, which means that\nthe evil dragon is very likely nearby. I\nwas originally planning to just get by\nand muddle through life. But how am I\nsupposed to survive with a giant dragon\nnearby? Hoping for a stroke of luck,\nFong Yu asked, \"Is the giant dragon\nnearby?\" Valentina blinked her big eyes\nand nodded, saying, \"Yes, its dragon's\nnest is on the mountain outside the\nsouthern forest about 5 mi from here. 5\nis 2.5 km, which would take a normal\nperson about 10 minutes to walk, but a\ngiant dragon could cover the distance\nwith a single flap of its wings,\nprobably in less than 3 minutes.\" \"This\nis fucking\" Fonu rubbed his forehead and\nsighed helplessly. He suddenly realized\nthat his cabin in the woods was truly\nsurrounded by enemies. There are\ncountless spiders in the woods to the\neast, wild boars in the woods to the\nwest, a mine in the woods to the north,\nand a terrifying monster is said to be\nhiding in the underground world of the\nmine. And finally, as I just learned,\nthere is a giant dragon behind the woods\nto the south. That's absolutely\noutrageous. Wasn't he supposed to be the\nchosen one? You're a child of divine\npunishment. Seeing that Fong Yu seemed\nto be in a bad mood, Valentina smiled\nslightly and said, \"Don't worry. That\ndragon won't come here.\" \"Are you sure?\"\nFongu raised an eyebrow. Valentina\nnodded and said, \"We drew a line with it\nmany years ago, and it won't come into\nthis forest.\" Upon hearing this, Fongu\npatted his chest and breathed a sigh of\nrelief. \"Fe, that's good.\" \"Hm, wait,\nwhat did you mean by territory?\"\nValentina blinked and stammered. That's\nright. It stays neutral with us. As long\nas we don't provoke it, it won't bother\nus. Okay, let's not think about it\nanymore and get ready for dinner. With\nthat, Valentina picked up the iron pot\nand walked towards the living room. Fong\nYu looked at Valentina, who was holding\nthe pot, and was slightly takenback. He\nasked, \"Huh? Aren't you a spirit? How\ncan you get in touch with an iron pot?\"\nUpon hearing this, Valentina removed her\nhands from the iron pot, which startled\nFongu. However, he discovered that the\niron pot did not fall to the ground, but\nremained suspended in midair. Valentino\nlaughed and said, \"Although I can't\ntouch physical objects yet, I can still\nmove some small things remotely.\" \"I\nsee,\" Fun Yu said with a sudden\nrealization and then said enviously. \"Is\nthis considered a superpower?\"\n\"Suppower?\" Valentina tilted her head\nand thought for a moment before\nreplying. I think it's more appropriate\nto describe it as mental power.\nActually, you can have this ability,\ntoo, as long as you can become a\nmagician. Upon hearing this, Fun Yu\nimmediately perked up and quickly asked,\n\"Really? You'll teach me?\" Valentina\nshook her head and said, \"To learn\nmagic, one must first have an affinity\nfor magical elements. And you don't meet\nthat requirement right now, master. How\ncan I gain an affinity for that magical\nelement? Fongu asked curiously. Well,\nthat depends on talent. Some people are\nborn with it while others gradually\nawaken it as they grow up. Does that\nmean I have no hope? Fongu is almost 30\nand has long since said goodbye to the\nprocess of growing up. However, there is\nan even simpler and more convenient\nmethod. Valentina said with a smile.\nWhat method? Let me possess your body.\nThen you can use my magic possession.\nFongu glanced at Valentina's translucent\nghostly body and a word came to mind.\nPossessed by a ghost. Instantly,\ngoosebumps rose all over his body. Never\nmind. I'm not really interested in magic\nanyway. Fongu shook his head and said,\n\"I'd better hurry up and eat. Let me see\nwhat's for dinner.\" He just kidding.\nActually, if you can find enough\nelemental crystals, you'll have a chance\nto gain affinity with the corresponding\nelement, and then you can become a\nmagician. Elemental crystals? Funu\nraised an eyebrow. Just from the name,\nhe knew it must be a rare item. So, he\nasked, \"Where can I find those things?\"\nAs far as I know, most elemental\ncrystals come from the underground\nworld, mined by dwarves, goblins, or\ncave insecttoids and cobalts who live\nunderground. dwarves, goblins,\ninsecttoids, and cobalts. Funu felt a\nbit bewildered, especially since he had\njust heard Valentina mention that there\nwas a giant dragon south of the forest.\nCould it be? Is the world of this\nsurvival game still filled with\ncountless races vying for supremacy?\nThis is I'm getting a little\nexcited just thinking about it. Chapter\n38. The Crow Tide arrives. After\nlearning from Valentina that various\nraces actually exist in this world,\nFongu realized that this survival game\nmight not be as simple as he had\nthought, and it was not just a simple\nwilderness survival game. As the story\nprogresses, players will inevitably come\ninto contact with these native races, at\nwhich point conflict between the two\ncivilizations is bound to erupt.\nTherefore, it is even more necessary for\nhim to improve his strength as soon as\npossible. As the saying goes, those who\nare not of our kind will surely have\ndifferent hearts. If he really\nencounters them, it will inevitably be a\nlife or death battle. Only the strong\ndeserve to survive. As for whether it is\npossible to coexist peacefully with\nthose different races, yes, but the\npossibility is very low. The\ninclusiveness of a race is directly\nproportional to its level of\ncivilization. The higher the level of\ncivilization, the greater the\ninclusiveness. the dwarves, goblins,\ncave insects, and cobalts that Valentina\nmentioned living underground. None of\nthese races sound like they have a\nhighly advanced civilization. Of course,\nthere is another possibility to suppress\nthose other races with overwhelming\npower, then manage, educate, and\nassimilate them, eventually merging them\ninto a multithnic group. However,\nachieving this goal still requires\nconsiderable strength. Ultimately,\nhaving great strength is the key to\nsuccess. So fawn, you stopped thinking\nabout it and went into the kitchen. I\nstarted preparing dinner. After all, you\nneed to be wellfed to have the energy to\nexplore, exercise, and strengthen\nyourself, right? Dinner was still\nmushroom soup, but the pork was replaced\nwith chicken. Unfortunately, the\ningredients in Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s warehouse\nare only enough to make this one dish\nright now. Otherwise, it would just be\nbarbecue. Fortunately, Fongu had only\nbeen eating this dish for a short time\nand wasn't tired of it yet. However, he\nreminded himself that he would have to\nlook for other ingredients in the\nexchange later. As long as conditions\npermit, one should try to be kinder to\none's stomach. This is one of the few\nthings Fongu pursues. After dinner, it\nstarted snowing heavily again outside.\nWith the howling wind, the goose\nfeather-like snowflakes danced wildly in\nthe air like white blades. Under these\ncircumstances, going out is impossible.\nVisibility is less than 3 m and the\ntemperature has dropped to nearly\nminus20° C. Going out would be no\ndifferent from committing suicide.\nBored, Fong Yu opened the exchange to\nlook for ingredients, but after\nsearching for a long time, he only found\na few vendors selling potatoes and\ncabbage, and the prices were not cheap.\nIt seemed that all the players were\nexperiencing a food shortage these past\n2 days. Helpless, Fongu traded 20\npotatoes and five cabbages. But soon he\ndiscovered that someone was selling\nseasonings such as chili peppers,\nscallions, ginger, garlic, and coarse\nsalt. These seasonings are very cheap\nbecause they don't fill you up except\nfor coarse salt, which costs the same as\nmeat. 15 pieces of wood per serving.\nWhen Fong Yu saw these seasonings, a\ndelicious dish suddenly popped into his\nmind. Spicy hot pot. Imagine in this\nfreezing snowy weather, having a pot of\nspicy hot pot and then dipping some\nmutton in it. It's a pity there's no\nlamb available right now, but you can\nhave pork, chicken, or rabbit meat for\nhot pot. Tsk tsk. I can't think about\nit. I can't think about it. Just\nthinking about it makes my mouth water.\nSo Fongu waved his hand and bought a\nwhole bunch of seasonings. Then in front\nof Valentina, he started preparing the\nhot pot base and told her how to make\nspicy hot pot. Spicy hot pot. Valentina\nblinked her slightly bewildered eyes\nafter hearing Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s description\nand said, \"I've never heard of it.\"\n\"It's normal that you haven't heard of\nit. It's a local delicacy from my\nhometown,\" Fong Yu said with a smile.\n\"How about this? I'll teach you how to\nmake spicy hot pot tomorrow. Let me tell\nyou, this stuff is amazing. It's\nincredibly satisfying to eat, Fongu\ndescribed excitedly. However, he then\nsaw a hint of loneliness in Valentina's\neyes, and he remembered that Valentina\nwas a ghost and could not eat. \"Uh, I'm\nsorry. I forgot you can't eat,\" Fongu\nsaid apologetically. \"It's all right,\"\nValentina smiled. \"As long as master is\nhappy, Valentina will be happy, too.\"\nWow, what an understanding girl. What a\npity. Thinking of this, Fong Yu couldn't\nhelp but ask. I remember that all three\nof you can evolve. If you continue to\nevolve in the future, will you be able\nto evolve into a physical form?\nValentina looked at Fong Yu in silence\nfor a moment, then slowly said, \"I think\nit should be fine.\" Back in his bedroom,\nFongu lay on the bed, pondering\nValentina's words. He didn't know if\nValentina could truly evolve into a\nphysical form or if she was just trying\nto comfort him. But in any case, he\nstill felt that he should help these\nthree partners evolve as much as\npossible. After all, they had helped him\nso much and he should think about\nrepaying them. Although he was a lazy\nbum who was used to just loafing around\nand waiting to die, he was still a lazy\nbum with feelings and loyalty. Just as\nFong Yu was dozing off, a system message\nsuddenly popped up in the chat channel\nand was pinned to the top. Friendly\nreminder, the Raven Swarm will arrive\ntomorrow. Please try to avoid going out\nas Raven have a strange attraction to\nreflective objects such as your\neyeballs, some people's bald heads, or\nother things. Funu immediately sobered\nup upon seeing this message. What is\nthis thing? A swarm of crows? At that\nmoment, a prompt from the game assistant\nappeared in the air. Jackals flock.\nJackals are birds that prefer low\ntemperatures. They migrate to colder\nregions year round depending on the\nclimate. They are carnivorous birds of\nprey and are particularly attracted to\nshiny things. So if you don't want to go\nblind, it's best not to go out tomorrow.\nWhen Fongu saw the words bird of prey,\nhe completely abandoned any hope of\ngetting away with it. After all, birds\nof prey that can be called carnivorous\nbirds of prey are all extremely powerful\naerial predators. Looks like I'll have\nto stay indoors tomorrow. However, this\ndidn't bother Fongu. He had enough\nsupplies anyway, and as a lazy bum, he\nwas actually quite happy to have a\nlegitimate reason to stay home for a\nday. However, for players who have run\nout of resources, tomorrow may be a\ntough day. Fongu glanced at the chat\nchannels user count, 7,221\npeople. Some more people had died.\nJudging from this situation, I estimate\nthat the number will likely drop below\n7,000 by tomorrow. In less than 5 days,\nthe number of people has plummeted by\nnearly 30%. I don't know about the\nsituation in other regions, but overall\nit should be similar. Many people will\ndie in the winter challenge. After this\nwinter, there are still 12 days of\ncompetition left, followed by the\nmerging of the 10 districts. At that\ntime, the districts with the lowest\nnumber of survivors and the lowest\namount of resources will be attacked by\nmonstrous beasts of a natural disaster\nlevel. It might even wipe out the entire\ndistrict. Then Fong Yu thought of a\nquestion. If fewer people die in\nDistrict 6 during this winter challenge,\nwouldn't District 6 have a greater\nadvantage than other districts? At that\nmoment, the game assistant sent a\nmessage. That's good. You're starting to\nlearn to think about problems from a\nholistic big picture perspective. Huh?\nFa was somewhat taken aback. Why did\nthis sentence suddenly pop up? As I said\nfrom the beginning, this is a survival\ngame concerning the life and death of\nall humanity. If you only think about\nyourself, your ending is destined to\nfail. Fongu frowned and fell into deep\nthought. Indeed, as Valentina mentioned\nbefore, there are many races in this\nworld. Although there seem to be as many\nas 100,000 players, compared to the\nnatives of this world, they are probably\njust a drop in the ocean. They are\nprobably still in the newbie protection\nphase and haven't had any contact with\nthe local races yet. As they level up in\nlater stages of the game, they will\ndefinitely have conflicts with the local\nraces. And these conflicts will be\nalmost irreconcilable, a matter of life\nand death. Imagine if the nations of\nEarth suddenly discovered a race from\nanother world on Earth. How would they\nreact? There are only two possibilities.\nEliminate or enslave. Unless this alien\nrace is powerful enough that Earth's\ncivilization cannot defeat it. So here's\nthe question. Given their current\nsituation, can these players defeat the\ncivilization of this world? Without a\ndoubt, it's impossible. Putting\neverything else aside, just look at that\ngiant dragon on the southern mountain.\nForget about players who can't even get\nenough to eat. Even a player like Fong\nYu, who is extremely well-developed,\nwould probably be instantly killed if he\nwent there. Therefore, if these players\nwant to survive in this world, they must\ndevelop quickly. Whether they follow the\nmagical technology of this world or the\nphysical technology of Earth, they must\ndevelop to be powerful enough to avoid\nbeing destroyed or enslaved by the\ncivilization of this world. So, how\nshould we achieve this goal? The first\nstep Fong you could think of was to try\nto reduce the player's death rate as\nmuch as possible. The fewer people die,\nthe faster they can develop and the\nhigher their potential can be.\nCurrently, all districts are still under\nlockdown. So, he has no idea what the\nsituation is in other districts and can\nonly consider the situation in his own\ndistrict first. Therefore, in order to\nreduce the number of deaths in this\narea, Funu felt that he should think of\nanother way. Currently, it seems that\nthose who are still alive should already\nhave wooden houses, which provides the\nmost basic ability to withstand the\ncold. However, the cold weather prevents\nmost players from going out, and without\ngoing out, they cannot obtain supplies,\namong which food is particularly\nimportant. Fong Yu carefully examined\nthe messages left by the players who\ndied in the chat channel before they\ndied. They were mostly about how their\nhunger level had dropped to zero and\ntheir stamina was being depleted,\nleading to their eventual death. In\nother words, as long as he can help\nother players solve the problem of food\nsupply, he should be able to effectively\nreduce the mortality rate of players in\nzone 6. But how do we solve the problem\nof food supply? This problem gave Fongu\na headache. The most direct way is for\nhim to go to the wild boar forest and\nspider forest, kill more wild boores and\nspiders, and then put the wild boar meat\nand spider meat on the exchange for\nconsignment. But upon closer inspection,\nthis method also won't work because\nthere will be a swarm of crows tomorrow\nand I won't be able to go out. Thinking\nof the cold crow tide, Fongu suddenly\nfelt a flash of inspiration. Wait, the\nsystem just said that those crows are\nbirds of prey. If they are birds of\nprey, they must be quite large, right?\nSo, they must have quite a bit of flesh\non their bodies, right? Thinking of\nthis, Funu's lips curled up into a\nsmile. While other players were still\ncomplaining about the crow tide in the\nchat channel, he had already started to\nhave his eye on the crow tide. Tsktsk,\nif we're lucky, we should have some new\ningredients for tomorrow's spicy hot\npot. Chapter 39. With a little brain\npower, even natural disasters can be\nturned into benefits. In the eyes of the\npeople of the foodloving empire, there\nis no animal that cannot be eaten unless\nit is really not tasty. As for birds of\nthe sky like crows, let alone the eight\nmajor cuisines, Fongu knows so many\ncooking methods that you can't count\nthem all on one hand. Steaming, boiling,\nbrazing, frying, grilling, and so on.\nThere's no repetition. Of course, none\nof these are the main points. The main\npoint is how do we turn the crow into\nfood? If you want to turn a crow into\nfood, you have to find a way to catch\nit. to catch birds of prey. Besides\nhunting rifles and bows and arrows,\nwhich Fong Yu didn't have, the only\nother option was traps. So, Fong Yu got\nout of bed again and went to the\nworkbench in the living room to study\nhow to make a trap. Currently, he can\nmake four types of traps: wooden spikes\nand spider fong spikes, both used for\ndefense and capturing animals. The other\ntwo are small and large animal traps,\nwhich can be used to capture birds.\nThese are all of white quality and do\nnot require crafting blueprints. The\nsmall animal trap is relatively simple\nto make, requiring only tin branches and\ntwo vines. However, the instructions\nstate that it can only be used to catch\nsmall animals such as feeasants and\nrabbits. Since jackaw are birds of prey,\nthis small animal trap is unlikely to\ncatch them, so it is also a no-go. The\nlarge animal trap requires 20 wood, 10\nbranches, and 10 vines. The description\nsays it can capture animals up to 2 m in\nsize. So, Fun, you asked the game\nassistant what the size of the crow was.\nThe jackd is typically 50 to 80 cm long\nwith a wingspan of 1.5 to 2 m. Since\nthat's the case, this large animal trap\nshould be able to catch crows. So, Fong,\nyou generously made 10 of them. With the\nanimal trap problem solved, the\nremaining question is what to use as\nbait. According to the systems\ndescription, Jack Daws like things that\nreflect light and sparkle, so it's\nobvious what kind of bait to use. Fonu\nglanced at his warehouse and backpack.\nApart from silver and gold, he didn't\nseem to have anything else that could\nreflect light and shine. Moreover, he\nonly had gold ore and silver ore, which\nhe would have to forge into gold ingots\nand silver ingots using a forge. But\nthen he thought of something. Ice cubes.\nIsn't it just something that's\nreflective and shiny? However,\nconsidering that ice is readily\navailable in winter, the Jack Daw\nprobably wouldn't be interested in plain\nice, so the appearance of the ice must\nbe changed. The best way is to dye the\nice. When it comes to dying, Fongu\nnaturally thinks of green plum berries.\nThe juice of these berries is bright\ngreen, so it should be fine for dying.\nSo without further ado, Fongu took out a\nbucket of bath water he had stored\nbefore, threw in two green plum berries,\nand crushed them. Soon the bath water\nturned green. Next, all we need to do is\nfreeze the water into ice, then cut it\ninto pieces and put them into the large\nanimal trap, and there shouldn't be any\nproblems. So Fong, you put the dyed\nbuckets outside and waited for the water\nto freeze. to prevent one bucket of\nwater from not having enough ice. He\ndyed nine more buckets and put them\noutside to freeze together. Anyway,\nthere's plenty of bath water and it's a\nway to reuse waste, so I don't feel bad\nabout wasting it. After waiting for more\nthan an hour, all 10 large animal traps\nwere completed and the dying water\noutside the door had frozen. Everything\nwas ready. Funu took this opportunity to\nshare his method, which anyone could\nuse, in the chat channel. In an instant,\nthe entire chat channel was in an\nuproar. From the moment the system\nannounced that there would be a raven\ntide tomorrow until now, almost everyone\nwas complaining, saying that the system\nwas too inhumane. Winter was already\nhard enough, and now they had to come up\nwith this raven tide to annoy people.\nBut now things are much better. With the\ntrap hunting method provided by Fong Yu,\nas long as they have enough materials to\nmake large animal traps, they have the\nopportunity to catch crows without\nleaving their homes. Of course, some\npeople questioned whether such traps\ncould actually catch crows. But despite\nthe doubts, most players decided to give\nit a try and started building giant\nanimal traps. After all, this thing\nisn't a one-time use item. Even if it\ncan't catch a jack doll, it can try to\ncatch other prey, right? Moreover, the\nbait is simply dyed ice. Those who are\nreluctant to use berries for dying can\nuse the juice from crushed leaves, which\ncosts almost nothing. Even the most\ntrolls and keyboard warriors\nsurprisingly praised Fong Yu for this\nfree-for-all survival method.\nImmediately, under the protection of the\ncorpse dog, Alpha, Fongu carried a torch\nto the outside of the wooden house and\nplaced 10 large animal traps around the\nhouse. He was too lazy to chisel out the\ngreen ice blocks, so he simply put one\ntrap in each cage, making sure they were\nlarge enough to attract the attention of\nthe crows. It was late at night when the\ntrap was set. Fong Yu soaked his feet in\nhot water, then crawled into the down\ncomforter and fell into a comfortable\nsleep. Early the next morning, Fong Yu\nwas awakened by a noisy cawing sound.\nAnd it wasn't just one or two cawing\nsounds, but rather a cawing sound that\nechoed throughout the entire wooden\nhouse. Funu, who had just come to his\nsenses, was about to curse a few words,\nbut then he remembered something,\nquickly got out of bed, dressed, and\nwent out of the wooden house to take a\nlook. Woohoo! We succeeded. At this\nmoment, two large gray white birds were\nflapping their wings and fluttering in\nthe large animal traps on both sides of\nthe entrance. Their feathers were flying\neverywhere, and their sharp, long beaks,\nwhich gleamed with a cold light, were\nopening and closing and making a cawing\nsound. Their sharp claws had scratched\nout shocking marks on the wooden bars of\nthe animal traps. Judging from this, it\nshould be the so-called raptor, the\njackdaw. Funu then looked around again\nand discovered that not only these two\ncages, but also the cages next to them\nhad captured crows, and some cages even\nhad two crows inside. So he looked up at\nthe sky again and saw thousands of gray\ncrows circling high in the sky. And\nevery now and then a crow would swoop\ndown toward Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s wooden house.\nHowever, Fongu placed the animal traps\nin a very particular way. The entrance\nto the traps faced outwards and a narrow\npath just big enough for a person to\nwalk through was left between the animal\ntraps and the wooden house. The path was\nblocked by the eaves so the crows in the\nsky could not get in. Therefore, Fong Yu\nimmediately slipped into the narrow path\nbetween the animal trap and the wooden\nhouse, avoiding the gaze of the crows in\nthe sky. Alpha guarded Fong Yu from\nbehind to prevent any crows from\nsneaking in from the entrance of the\npath to launch a sneak attack. After\nconfirming his safety, Fongu took out a\nwooden spear from his backpack and\nstabbed at the crow in the animal trap\nin front of him. The crow dodged the\nfirst two thrusts, but on the third\nthrust, Fong Yu stabbed the crow\ndirectly in the chest, killing it\ninstantly. Immediately, Fongu clicked on\nthe decomposition and pickup option\ndirectly on the crow's corpse. Received\ntwo jacked meat, five feathers. He Fong\nYu smiled upon seeing his catch. It\nproved that his hunting plan had been a\nsuccess. So, he used the same method to\nkill the remaining nine jacks in the\ntraps, a total of 12. and harvested 24\npieces of meat, 60 feathers, and three\njack eggs. Feeling great. It turns out\nthat as long as you use your brain,\nnatural disasters can be turned into\nbenefits. Chapter 40. Upgrading the\nbackpack, shopping on the exchange.\nAfter harvesting the crows from the\ntraps, Fongu returned to the cabin and\nbegan humming a little tune as he made\nbreakfast. As for what breakfast\nconsisted of, of course, he made fried\neggs with fresh crow eggs along with a\npiece of fried pork chop and sprinkled\nsome coarse salt and scallions bought\nfrom the exchange. The wonderful aroma\nimmediately filled the kitchen with\nseasoning. It just feels different. Now\nall I need is a glass of milk and a\npiece of bread to complete my\nwesternstyle breakfast. But right now, I\nhaven't even seen a single cow's hair,\nlet alone milk. Oh well, I'll just have\nto make do with some plain water for\nnow. As for bread, it would have to wait\nuntil the farmland was ready. The wheat\nseeds were planted, the wheat grew, then\nit was ground into flour and finally\nprocessed into bread, noodles, buns, and\nother delicacies. Although it was\ncomplicated and far-fetched, food was\none of Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s few interests, and\nhe was willing to pay the price and wait\nfor it. Just as Fong Yu, Guzy, and\nLittle Spider Sakura were sharing a\ndelicious breakfast, the animal traps\noutside started making noises one after\nanother with a continuous cawing sound,\nindicating that more crows had probably\nbeen caught. Fongu smiled slightly. He\nhad to admit that his method for\ncapturing crows was indeed very\neffective. So, he opened the chat\nchannel to see if the players who\nfollowed his advice had succeeded. Dong\nHao ID 3356. Oh my, my animal trap just\ncaught a crow. I got two pieces of meat.\nI can finally eat meat. I'm so excited.\nWuhan, ID 2296. You only have one? I\nhave two in my cage. Huh? Hang\n4516. I set up three cages and not only\ncaught two jacks, but also a baby wild\nboar. Tion Kong ID7171.\nI'm so envious of you guys. I don't have\nenough materials to make a beast trap.\nCould some kind soul please give me five\npieces of wood? Su Linllin ID59. I still\nhave to thank Fong Yu for his\nselflessness in telling us such a good\nmethod. Jeang Pong ID7761.\nYes. Thank you, Fong Yu. Ludu ID702.\nThank you, Fong Yu. Wong Fong ID 2516.\nThank you. Plus 10,086.\nFu glanced at the chat channel and found\nthat apart from a few players who didn't\nhave enough materials to make a large\nanimal trap, almost everyone else had\ncaught a crow using this method, which\nmade him very happy. Human satisfaction\nis not always obtained through taking.\nSometimes a certain amount of effort can\nbring great spiritual satisfaction after\nbeing recognized by others. Some people\nsay this is vanity. No, vanity is doing\nthings to be praised by others. While\nFong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s actions were purely to\nhelp other players and to reduce the\nnumber of deaths, he didn't do it for\nthe sake of being praised. The starting\npoint is different. So, the nature of\nhis actions is naturally different.\nAfter thinking for a moment, Fong Yu\nleft another comment in the comment\nsection. Fong Yuid 06. Remember to\ncollect the feathers you get. 30\nfeathers plus three flax can make a down\ncomforter and 15 feathers plus two flax\ncan make a down jacket. They are both\nimportant items for keeping warm. Fong\nYu's words immediately stirred up the\ncomment section again in the winter\nchallenge. Besides food, the most\nimportant thing is to keep warm. While\nfood can be obtained by catching Jack\nDoss, a fire must be kept burning\nconstantly to keep the cabin warm. If\nyou run out of wood or branches and\ncan't start a fire, you'll freeze to\ndeath. Therefore, players still need to\nfind ways to make warm supplies and then\ngo out to collect resources such as wood\nto ensure that the fireplace or campfire\nburns properly. Without warm clothing,\nplayers cannot go out to collect\nsupplies. And without collecting\nsupplies, they are likely to be trapped\nindoors and freeze to death, falling\ninto a vicious cycle. Therefore, Fong\nYu's words inadvertently saved the lives\nof many players. After breakfast, Fongu\nwent out for another walk. This time,\nsix crows entered the 10 cages. Although\nit wasn't many, it had only taken half\nan hour, so it was already a very\ngenerous reward. After finishing\nharvesting the prey in the cages, Fongu\nreturned to the cabin to upgrade it.\nActually, his house was already good\nenough. He only needed a few iron ingots\nto upgrade it. The iron ore previously\nplaced in the forge has all been\nsmelted, yielding 100 iron nails, enough\nto upgrade the wooden house twice. Just\nas Fong Yu was preparing to upgrade the\nwooden house. The game assistant sent\nhim a notification. There is an obstacle\naround your cabin, a large animal trap.\nPlease clear the obstacle to make enough\nspace before you can upgrade. Fongu\nsuddenly realized that upgrading the\nwooden house would increase its floor\nspace, and the large animal traps\noutside were all set up by him over a\nlong period of time, placed close to the\neaves. Moreover, there are still large\nflocks of crows outside and the animal\ntraps are in use, so rearranging them\nwould be counterproductive. In that\ncase, let's wait a couple of days until\nwinter is over before upgrading.\nImmediately, the wealthy Fong Yu waved\nhis hand and bought another 100 iron ore\nfrom the exchange, putting them into the\nforging furnace to slowly smelt, just in\ncase. Fong Yu, who always felt that his\nbackpack was too small, exchanged 30\npieces of animal hide for one piece of\ncrow meat and then went directly to the\ncrafting table to upgrade his pigkin\nbackpack. Fortunately, upgrading the\npigkin backpack doesn't require using\nonly pigkin. However, the upgraded\nbackpack looks awful with a patch of\nwhite leather on the east side, a patch\nof black leather on the west side, a\npatch of yellow leather on top, and a\npatch of purple leather on the bottom,\nmaking it look like it's covered in\npatches. Despite its unattractive\nappearance, the capacity has indeed been\nupgraded from 15 to 30 compartments.\nUnfortunately, the pigkin backpack can\nonly be upgraded to this size, but it's\nstill sufficient for Fong use current\nneeds. Pigkin backpack. Large is sturdy\nand durable extra-large backpack. A\ngreat help for travel or moving, but it\nis recommended to temporarily discard it\nduring combat as carrying it will reduce\nyour movement speed by 10% and when\nfully loaded, it will reduce it by 20%.\nH there's a negative effect of slowing\ndown. Funu raised an eyebrow. After\nthinking about it carefully, he could\naccept it. After all, it was reasonable\nand logical for such a large backpack to\nhave a slowing effect. After upgrading\nhis backpack, Fong Yu had nothing to do,\nbut he wasn't sleepy yet, so he could\nonly open the exchange and browse to see\nif he could find anything good. Fongu\nhad never really studied the exchange\nbefore. And in the first 2 days,\neveryone was basically collecting basic\nresources, so there wasn't anything\nparticularly noteworthy in the exchange.\nAnd he didn't really browse around. But\nyou still have to browse the stock\nexchange every day. You never know when\nyou might find something good. Chapter\n41. Lucky or unlucky. After more than 10\nminutes of careful study, Fongu had\nbasically mastered all the functions of\nthe exchange. The exchanges interface is\nactually quite comprehensive with over a\ndozen categories, including equipment,\nfood, skills, plants, minerals, pets,\ncrafting blueprints, and special\nresources. You can even filter by grade,\nwhich is very convenient. The equipment\nslots are divided into weapons, armor,\ntools, etc., but there's nothing\nparticularly good. The best weapons are\niron swords and iron spears, and the\nbest armor is the wild boar set that\nFong you sold before. The food is\nbasically just berries, apples, and some\nvendors selling crow meat and crow eggs.\nAs for plants and minerals, there are no\nspecial resources. They are mostly gray\nor white grade resources such as wood,\nvines, iron, ore, copper or coal, and\nsalt peter. You can hardly see any\nresources of blue grade or above. The\nitems being sold on the exchange show\nthat players across the region are still\nextremely lacking in resources. It\nwasn't until Fong Yu opened the\nblueprint creation interface that he\ndiscovered something good. Seller Lu X\nYaoang ID 520 item for sale. Horn Fong\nbow crafting blueprint green exchange\nitem 10 pieces of meat or 50 berries.\nUpon seeing this, Fong Yu's eyes lit up.\nHis current weapons besides the iron axe\nwere only a wooden spear, all melee\nweapons. He was missing a ranged weapon,\nso he didn't hesitate to exchange 10\npieces of crow meat for the bow and\narrow crafting blueprint. He originally\nintended to use the spider meat to make\na small profit. But considering that\nthere wasn't much spider meat left and\nhe needed to save it for the dog's food\nand that eating it might upset a\nperson's stomach or make them weak, he\ndecided not to do something that would\nharm others and himself. After acquiring\nthe bow and arrow crafting blueprint,\nFong Yu continued browsing. When he\nopened the skill sales interface, he\ndiscovered something else interesting.\nSeller: Loose Yao Fang ID 520. Item for\nsale. Butcher skill. Exchange item. 15\npieces of meat or 100 berries. Huh? What\nis the art of butchering? Upon closer\ninspection, Fong Yu discovered that the\nbutcher's technique was marked in blue,\nwhich meant it was a rare skill.\nButcher's skill. After learning this\nskill, players can obtain more materials\nwhen dissecting prey. H more materials.\nFong Yu then remembered that when he\ndissected the wild boar carcass, he only\nobtained three things: pigkin, pork, and\nbones. But upon closer inspection, he\nrealized that a wild boar shouldn't only\nhave these things. It should also have a\nheart, lungs, awful, and so on. For Fong\nYu, who runs a foodie empire, these are\nall delicious ingredients. But why\ndidn't she keep this skill for herself\ninstead of selling it? Fongu felt\nsomewhat puzzled. Of course, despite his\ndoubts, Fong Yu bought the butcher's\nmanual without hesitation. Maybe the\nother person got two of the same skill\nbooks, or maybe they didn't like the\nskill. Who knows? Besides, it's just 15\npieces of meat. Fong Yu now has tens of\nthousands of pieces of timber in his\npossession, so this little bit of meat\nis nothing to him. It's worth it for\ndelicious ingredients. Fong Yu then\ncontinued browsing the exchange and when\nhe opened the special item sales\ninterface, he discovered something else.\nSeller Lu X Yaoang ID520 consignment\nitem rum 60-year aged exchangeable item\ntwo pieces of meat or 20 berries.\nWoohoo! There are still people selling\nalcohol and it's 60-year-old vintage. I\nwonder if it's even drinkable. But can\nthis really be considered a special\nitem? But Fongu thought about it\ncarefully. If a wine that is 60 years\nold were sold in the real world, it\nwould probably cost tens of thousands of\ndollars as a luxury item. So, exchanging\ntwo pieces of meat doesn't seem like a\nbad deal. In fact, it's quite\nprofitable. In addition, considering\nthat we're planning to have hot pot\ntonight, how can we do without alcohol?\nSo, Fong Yu still generously bought the\nbottle of rum. At this moment, Fongu\nsuddenly realized something. Upon closer\ninspection, he discovered that the three\nvaluable items he had purchased were all\nmade by the same person. That player\nnamed Lu X Yao Fang. Judging from the\nname, it sounds like a girl. This guy is\nreally lucky. He actually got a blue\nquality skill. It seems he has a bit of\nluck. He also got a bow and arrow\ncrafting blueprint and rum. Fongu was\nvery envious. Could it be that there are\nsome ruins near her spawn point and\nthat's why she discovered some treasure?\nThinking about this, Fongu felt it was\nnecessary to add Lu X Yao Fang as a\nfriend and ask her how she got these\nthings and also to ask if she had any\nother good stuff. The friend request was\naccepted quickly and the other party\nsent a message. Lu X Yaoang ID 520. Wow,\nFong Yu actually added me as a friend.\nFong Yu ID006.\nDo you recognize me? Liao Fang ID 520.\nOf course, you're the best player in our\nregion now. Fong Yu ID006,\nthe most powerful. Loose Yao Fang ID\n520. H, you've sold a lot of wild boar\nmeat and spider meat these past 2 days,\nso you must have killed a lot of wild\nboars and spiders. Fong UID006,\nthat was just good luck. Lu X Yao Fang\nID 520. You're so modest and you're such\na kind person. Everyone else keeps their\nbest skills to themselves, but you've\ngenerously shared your methods for\nhunting wild boars and spiders with all\nthe players. That's amazing. Loose Yao\nFang ID520. I also learned how to catch\njackd from you. That giant animal trap.\nI've already caught three jackdy\nsent by the other party, Fongu suddenly\nfelt embarrassed. He knew that he was\nnot as noble as the other party said. He\nonly published the methods of hunting\nwild boores and spiders to make some\nmoney. As for publishing the method of\nhunting jackdos, it was indeed to reduce\nthe number of deaths. But in the end, he\nstill did these things for his own\nbenefit. Lu Xiaoang ID 520. By the way,\nwhat's up, boss? Fong UID006.\nOh, I just wanted to ask how you\nobtained the bow and arrow crafting\nblueprint, the butcher's technique, and\nthe rum. If it's convenient, please tell\nme. If not, never mind. Lu X Yao Fang ID\n520. Well, if it were someone else, I\ndefinitely wouldn't say it. But if it's\nyou, sir, then of course I'll say it.\nLiao Fang ID 520. There is a small\nmountain not far north of my house, and\nthere is a cave at the bottom of the\nmountain. A big grizzly bear used to\nlive in the cave. But yesterday, the big\ngrizzly bear was carried away by a giant\ndragon. Then I went into the bear cave\nand found the remains of a hunter and\nthree bronze chests inside. I opened\nthem and got these things. Judging from\nthe hunter's remains, the bear den must\nhave been a hiding place for hunters\nbefore. So, it's understandable that\nthey could find bow and arrow\nblueprints, butchering techniques, and\nrum. But wait, the bear in the bear den\nwas carried away by a giant dragon. This\nis actually allowed. Although Fong, you\nhad never seen a bear in this world,\nwild boars could grow to three or four\nmeters long. So, it wouldn't be\nunreasonable for a bear to be five or 6\nmeters long, right? That's about the\nlength of a truck. Such a big bear. And\nit was carried away by a dragon. How big\nmust that dragon be? I dare not think\nabout it. It's terrifying to\ncontemplate. Fu initially thought this\ngirl was incredibly lucky to have\nacquired so many good things, but now it\nseems it's hard to say whether she's\ntruly lucky or unlucky. Who knows? She\nmight just be snatched away by that\ndragon one day. However, it seems\nthere's a giant dragon living on the\nmountain south of my forest. H speaking\nof which, could these two dragons be the\nsame one? Fongu thought it was very\nlikely because the number of dragons was\nalready very small. Does that mean that\nthe female player named Lu X Yao Fang\nactually lives nearby? For a fleeting\nmoment, the idea of inviting Lu Xiao\nFang to live with him popped into Fong\nYu&lt;unk&gt;s mind, but he dismissed it after\na brief moment of thought. Putting\neverything else aside, just the nature\nof his haunted house alone would\nprobably be too much for most female\nplayers to handle, and Fongu also didn't\nknow what kind of person the other party\nwas. After all, this is a world of\nsurvival, and one can never be too\ncareful. Most importantly, he is now\ncompletely self-sufficient and there is\nno need for another person to affect his\nlife. Moreover, he has three companions\nwith him and doesn't feel lonely, so\nhe's not considering finding teammates\nfor the time being. So, Fong Yu asked Lu\nXiaoang again why she wanted to sell\nthese useful supplies. Lu Xiaoang\nreplied that she had hemophobia and\ncouldn't use the butcher's skill.\nMoreover, she had neither the materials\nnor the knowledge to use a bow and\narrow. As for rum, she didn't drink it\neither, so she suggested that she\nexchange it for some food that could\nsave her life and get through the winter\nfirst. After learning the whole story,\nFongu smiled slightly. In that case, he\nreally did get a great deal. After\nexchanging pleasantries for a while, the\ntwo ended their conversation.\nImmediately, Fongu prepared to use the\nblueprint he had just obtained to make\nthe hornfong bow and arrow. Chapter 42.\nmaking hornfong bows and arrows and\nenjoying spicy hot pot. After ending his\nchat with Lu Xiao Fang, Fong Yu took out\nthe blueprints for making a bow and\narrow that he had just bought from his\nbackpack and immediately chose to learn\nthem. The blueprint for crafting the\nhorn fong bow and arrow has been\nunlocked. It can be crafted. Crafting\nrequirements for horn bow 17120/2\nwood two halves bore tusks or 0/2 cow\nhorns 6 tin/2 rot tan arrow crafting\nrequirements 17120/1\nwood 182/5\nfeathers five arrows can be crafted at a\ntime crafting requirements for the\nquiver 17120/1\nwood 6 tin/2 rot tan It can be crafted.\nHm. I didn't expect that making bows and\narrows would require cow horns or wild\nboar tusks. No wonder it's called a horn\nand tusk bow. Luckily, I killed an adult\nwild boar before and got two wild boar\ntusks, which will come in handy now.\nLet's make it. Incidentally, Fong Yu\nalso made 20 feathered arrows and a\nquiver. Actually, a quiver is\nunnecessary. He can simply take arrows\nfrom his backpack, which is quick and\neasy. But anyone who has seen Lord of\nthe Rings knows that the elven prince's\npose of taking an arrow from the quiver\nand shooting it is just too cool. Fongu\nfelt it was necessary to add a quiver to\nsatisfy his little pleasure of showing\noff since the materials weren't\nexpensive to make. Anyway, after\nfinishing the horn bow, Fong Yu couldn't\nwait to practice shooting in the living\nroom. The living room was only 5 m long,\nbut Fong Yu sadly discovered that he\ncouldn't even hit a target 5 m away. his\nskills were really lacking. Moreover,\nafter shooting less than 20 arrows, Fong\nYu&lt;unk&gt;s arms and latisimus dorsy\nmuscles began to ache. However, this is\nthe level of a normal person who has\nnever practiced archery. It seems that\nshooting is not only a technical skill,\nbut also a physical one. Looks like I\nneed to work on my training. Thinking of\nthis, Fongu opened the interface and\nglanced at his attributes. Name: Fong\nYu, race, human. Attribute version 0 to\n10 represents an average person with an\naverage value of five. Intelligence 7.52\nno change. Strength 4.98. This is 0.7\nmore than 4 days ago. It seems that the\nrecent activities of cutting down trees\nand hunting have had some training\neffect. Agility 5.51. It only increased\nby 0.2. Well, it's better than nothing.\nOverall, the past few days have improved\nmy physical fitness to some extent.\nAlthough the improvement is small, it's\nbetter than nothing. I wonder if there\nare any items in this game that can\nimprove attributes, Fongi thought to\nhimself, just as the game assistant gave\nhim a hint. Chests of silver rank and\nabove have a low chance of containing\nitems that can improve a player's base\nstats. Later ranked tournaments will\nalso offer rewards for items that boost\nplayer stats. And defeating monsters of\nlord rank and above also has a chance to\nyield these items. H a silver treasure\nchest. Fongu scratched his head. He had\nnever seen that thing before. As for the\nranking competition, Fongu didn't have\nhigh hopes. He just hoped that his\nregion wouldn't fall into the bottom\nfive in the subsequent merge rankings.\nAs for defeating monsters of lord level\nor higher, Fongu didn't even dare to\nthink about it. If an adult wild boar is\nonly of ordinary white grade, then what\nkind of monster must the lord be? That\ndragon is probably a lordle monster, but\nwhy would I be asked to hunt a dragon?\nThat's like an old man hanging himself.\nTired of living. Sigh. Forget it. I'll\njust be a lazy bum. Despite saying that,\nFongu still drew his arrows and began\npracticing archery. The day passed\nquickly. By evening, Funu had become\nquite proficient at using a bow and\narrow, and his hit rate against targets\nwithin 5 meters was generally above 80%.\nTo be fair, to have mastered this level\nof skill in just one day, he's quite\ntalented. But he knew that this was far\nfrom enough. After all, 5 m was far too\nclose. If it were a small animal, it\nwould probably spot Fong Yu at 10 m and\nrun away before he could reach him.\nHowever, for large predators, a distance\nof 5 m means they can reach the face\nwith a single pounce. Therefore, it\nseems rather useless. But Fongu was not\ndiscouraged. He knew that Rome wasn't\nbuilt in a day, and his archery skills\ncouldn't be mastered overnight either.\nHe would take it slow and treat it as a\nlight exercise when he had nothing else\nto do. Anyway, it's snowing heavily\noutside and it's freezing cold, so we\ncan't go out. So, doing some exercise is\ngood for our physical and mental health.\nThroughout the day, Fong Yu went out\neight times and killed a total of 52\ncrows in the animal traps. These gains\nwere mainly concentrated in the morning\nand noon, and by the afternoon, almost\nno more crows fell into the traps. This\nshows that these crows do have some\nintelligence. After paying the price of\n52 of their companions lives, they\nfinally realized that the trap was a\nsnare. However, Fongu was already quite\nsatisfied with this. Moreover, he was\npleasantly surprised to find that since\nhe learned the art of butchering, the\nyield from dissecting a crow had\nincreased from two pieces of meat to\nthree pieces. In addition, he would\noccasionally dissect crow hearts,\nlivers, intestines, wings, and other\nparts. The 52 jackdaws yielded a total\nof 156 pieces of meat, 260 feathers, 22\njackdaw eggs, 12 jackdaw hearts, 15\njackdaw livers, nine jackdaw intestines,\nand 22 pairs of jackd wings. After\ncareful calculation, the extra benefits\nthat the butcher's skill brought him\nwere far greater than he had expected.\nLooks like we've got some new\ningredients for tonight's spicy hot pot.\nFong Yu smiled slightly. After reviewing\nhis own loot, Fong Yu then browsed the\nchat channel to see what other players\nin his region had gained. The chat log\nshow that the players in this area\ndidn't earn nearly as much as Fongu\ntoday. After all, they weren't as\nwealthy as Fong Yu, who could make 10\nlarge animal traps at once, and they\ndidn't have the butcher skill to\nincrease their profits. However, those\nwho made animal traps generally obtained\nmore than six pieces of crow meat, which\nwas enough to survive the winter\nchallenge. As night fell, the crow tide\ndisappeared into the horizon, and Fong\nYu finally prepared all the seasonings\nneeded for the spicy hot pot and began\nto make it. First, cut the scallions\ninto sections, sliced the ginger and\ngarlic, and cut the dried chilies into\npieces. Then cut some fat off the pork\npieces and fry it in a pot to render the\noil. Once the oil is hot, add the\nscallions, ginger, and garlic and sauté\nuntil fragrant. Fun Yu explained to\nValentina who was floating beside him as\nhe demonstrated. For him, making\ndelicious food is a very enjoyable\nprocess, and he is happy to share this\nenjoyment. Of course, he also had a\nselfish motive. He hoped that Valentina\nwould learn how to make hot pot so that\nshe could cook it for him in the future.\nTo Fong Yu's delight, Valentina seemed\nto have a strong interest in this dish\nshe had never seen before. She listened\nattentively to Fong Yu's explanation and\noccasionally let out a sweet praising\nsound. Alpha, squatting by the kitchen\ndoor, could only watch Valentina roll\nher eyes in exasperation. How could a\nghost possibly be interested in food?\nYou're such a showoff. It's a pity we\ndon't have fermented soybean paste and\nsugar, so I'll use mushrooms and berries\ninstead. I'll chop the mushrooms and\nberries into small pieces and stir fry\nthem together. We're also missing some\nstar anis and cinnamon, but that\nshouldn't be a big problem, Fong Yu\ncontinued. Then poured the prepared\nbroth into the iron pot. That's\nbasically it. Then it's just about\nkeeping it heated. I specially set up a\ncampfire in the living room to cook hot\npot. Come on, can you help me carry the\npot to the campfire in the living room?\nAt this point, Fu said to Valentina,\n\"When you evolve into a physical form in\nthe future, you can add some of your\nfavorite seasonings or ingredients if\nyou want to eat it.\" Valentina nodded,\nwaved her little hand at the iron pot,\nand the pot floated up on its own,\nflying towards the living room. Fongu\nwas incredibly envious of this scene.\nAfter the hot pot was set up, Fongu\nbrought out sliced wild boar meat, wild\nfeeasant meat, wild rabbit meat, Chinese\ncabbage, potatoes, crow hearts, crow\nintestines, crow wings, and other\ningredients to the hot pot. Next, we can\nhave hot pot. Chapter 43. The first hot\npot in winter. Looking at the boiling\nhot pot in front of him, Fong Yu\nsuddenly felt a pang of emotion. Before\ncoming into this world, he was just an\nunknown supernatural novelist. His books\nwere lukewarm and he was neither alive\nnor dead. At that time he often felt\nlike a walking corpse, not knowing what\nthe meaning of life was. But now he\nseems to have a bit of an understanding.\nIf his previous life was like a bowl of\nplain noodles, bland and tasteless, then\nhis life after entering this survival\ngame is like a pot of spicy hot pot,\nboiling and exciting. For a moment, he\ndidn't know which kind of life he\nwanted. Just as Fong Yu was slightly\nlost and thought for a moment, Alpha,\nwho was squatting by the hot pot with\ndrool dripping all over the ground,\nfinally couldn't help but bark at Fong\nYu. Woof! Huh? Fong Yu snapped out of\nhis days, smiled at the dog, and said,\n\"Can't wait. Okay, I'll cook it for you\nright now.\" As he spoke, Fong Yu picked\nup his chopsticks, took a slice of meat,\nand put it into the boiling hot pot.\nThere's a lot to know about cooking\nsliced meat. You can't cook it for too\nlong or the meat will become tough, but\nyou can't cook it for too short a time\neither. You have to watch it closely.\nOnce the meat slices have changed color\ninside and out, they're basically ready\nto eat. As he spoke, Fongu took the\ncooked meat slices out of the hot pot\nand waved them in front of the ghost\nValentine, the skeleton Ryan, the corpse\ndog, Alpha, and the spider Sakura. Sigh.\nWhat a pity. It's missing its soul\nwithout various dipping sauces. Oh well,\nI'll just have to make do for now. Then\nFongu put the slice of meat to his lips,\nblew on it, and placed it in the bowl in\nfront of the corpse dog. Alpha, here,\nyou can try the first piece. The dog\nglanced at the slices of meat in the\nbowl, then eagerly lowered its head,\npicked up a slice of meat, and swallowed\nit. How does it taste? Fong Yu asked,\nlooking at the dog. Woof. Fongu glanced\nhelplessly at Valentina and asked, \"What\ndoes it mean?\" Valentina laughed and\nsaid, \"It said it ate too fast and\ndidn't taste anything.\" \"Woof! What does\nthis mean?\" It said its tongue felt a\nlittle numb. And so Fong Yu's first hot\npot feast in this survival world began.\nUnfortunately, neither the ghost\nValentina nor the skeleton Ryan could\nenjoy the hot pot. But they still sat\naround it, eating with Fong Yu and\nAlpha. After eating several large pieces\nof meat, Fong Yu remembered that he had\nbought a bottle of wine. If he didn't\ndrink it now, when would he? So, he took\nthe bottle of rum out of the warehouse,\npoured himself a glass, and casually\nasked the dog, \"Would you like a glass,\ntoo?\" The dog's eyes lit up immediately,\nand just as it was about to nod,\nValentina spoke up first. Alfa can't\ndrink alcohol. It gets drunk even with\njust a little. \"So, what if I get\ndrunk?\" \"It's no big deal,\" Funu said\nwith a smile. Valentina cautioned. Once\nit gets drunk, it'll cause trouble and\nmight even tear the house down. Uh Fongu\nglanced at the dog and asked, \"You can\nalso act crazy when you're drunk.\" Alpha\nlowered its head in embarrassment. Funu\nthen put away the wine bottle and said,\n\"Since that's the case, then I won't let\nyou drink anymore. We put a lot of\neffort into upgrading this house to what\nit is now. It would be a pity to tear it\ndown.\" Immediately, Fong Yu raised his\nglass to the ghost Valentina. the\nskeleton Ryan and the corpse dog Alpha\nand solemnly said, \"So, I'd like to\npropose a toast to you all. Thank you\nfor taking care of me these past few\ndays.\" After saying that, Fongu raised\nhis glass with a bold gesture and drank\nit all in one gulp. After finishing his\ndrink, Fongu smacked his lips and asked\nin confusion, \"Why does this wine feel\nso weak?\" 5 minutes later, \"I'm so happy\nto have you all as friends.\" Fong Yu\ncried, hugging the skeleton of Ryan.\nRyan stared blankly at Fong Yu in his\narms, the soul fire in his eyes, almost\nturning into two question marks. He\nglanced at Valentina. He was drinking\nrum brood by dwarves, and it was 60\nyears old. Even dwarves would get drunk\nfrom that. The fact that he could still\nhold you and talk to you shows that he\nhas a very high alcohol tolerance.\nBefore long, the three ghosts in the\ncabin looked helplessly at Fong Yu, who\nwas lying in Ryan's arms, fast asleep\ndue to the effects of the alcohol.\n\"Although he lacks talent, he's a pretty\ngood person,\" Valentina said. Alpha\nnodded upon hearing this. Skeleton Ryan\nshrugged, then pointed to the bubbling\nhot pot, his chin moving as if he were\nsaying something. Valentina rolled her\neyes and said, \"Eat if you want, but you\nhave to carry your master back to bed\nfirst. So, Skeleton Ryan scooped up Fong\nYu and carried him back to his bedroom\nbed while Valentino waved her hand and\ncovered him with the down comforter.\nThen, Skeleton Ryan returned to the\nliving room. Sat down in front of the\nhot pot, tried to pick up the chopsticks\nFongu had used, picked up a piece of\nmeat, and put it into the hot pot to\ncook. After the meat changed color, he\ncouldn't wait to pick it out, and put it\nin his mouth. Smack! The slice of meat\nfell directly to the ground through the\ngap in Ryan's jawbone. Seeing this, a\nnearby dog pounced on the meat and bit\ninto its mouth. Ryan sighed and rubbed\nhis forehead, about to throw down his\nchopsticks and go to a corner to be sad\nfor a while when he heard the dog bark.\nWoof! Ryan glanced at the dog, then at\nthe hot pot, and had no choice but to\npick up another piece of meat and start\ncooking it. When Fong Yu woke up, it was\nalready the morning of the third day of\nthe winter challenge. He rubbed his\nslightly dizzy head and thought\ncarefully before he remembered that he\nseemed to have drunk too much and fallen\nasleep last night. This is a bit\nawkward. Funu then got dressed and went\nto the living room only to find that the\nsliced meat and crows ins on the table\nwere much less. Huh? I ate that much\nlast night. That can't be right. So he\nlooked down at the dog house under the\ntable and saw the corpse dog Alpha lying\nthere sprawled out, its belly round and\nplump. He he. So it was you who ate it.\nFunu chuckled. Upon closer inspection,\nhe noticed that Alpha had grown a layer\nof brown fur, making it look no\ndifferent from a normal mongrel dog.\nHuh? Wait, why is it a mongrel? Doesn't\nit have demonic blood? Why does it look\nso pathetic? Oh well, never mind. It's\nnot your fault you're ugly. Don't worry,\nI won't look down on you. Looking at the\nextinguished campfire and the cold hot\npot, Fong Yu turned and went to the\nkitchen to make a fried egg and a pork\nchop for breakfast. After all, he was\nafraid that his stomach would not be\nable to handle eating spicy hot pot for\nbreakfast. Sigh. I suddenly miss millet\nporridge with pickled vegetables. Tsk\ntsk Looks like I still need to hurry up\nand upgrade my house. Chapter 44. Alpha\ncan transform. Fong you read the house\nlevel description. Once upgraded to a\nmanor, the system would provide farmland\nfor planting wheat and rice, and he\ncould also grow some fruits and\nvegetables. Then we'll be able to live a\nlife where we can eat whatever we want.\nHe had considered cultivating farmland\nhimself, but as an online novelist, he\nknew nothing about farming except for\ntheoretical knowledge. He was afraid\nthat he might not do a good job and end\nup wasting the seeds. His cabin is\ncurrently a spacious one-star cabin. He\nneeds to upgrade it to three stars\nbefore he can reach the next level,\nwhich is the manor. Fortunately, he had\nenough supplies stored up, so if he\nwanted to, upgrading to the manor level\nin one go wouldn't be a problem. Wow,\nthe idyllic rural life of planting beans\nat the foot of Nanchchan Mountain isn't\nfar away. After finishing breakfast,\nFunu took the dog out. The dog had a\nround belly and walked with a wobbly\ngate, which looked quite comical. You\ncan't do this, Fong Yu said, looking at\nthe dog. At this rate, you'll be as big\nas a ball in just a few days. Upon\nhearing this, Alpha bent down to look at\nits belly, seemingly realizing that its\nappearance was somewhat comical, so it\nimmediately shook its body. To Fong\nYu&lt;unk&gt;s astonishment, after just a few\nshakes, he noticed that the dog's body\nhad visibly grown larger. Originally\nless than 80 cm long, it had grown to\nnearly 1 m in the blink of an eye. Not\nonly that, his yellow fur also grew\nrapidly from the original 2 or 3 cm to 5\nor 6 cm in length. At first glance,\nsomeone who didn't know better would\nthink he was a golden retriever. Wow,\nFong Yu exclaimed in admiration. Have\nyou evolved? Woof! The dog nodded. But\nno matter how I look at it, it doesn't\nseem to have much to do with demon\nbloodlines, Fong Yu said, puzzled.\nFeeling that its lineage was being\nquestioned, the dog began to exert all\nits strength. Its yellow fur started to\nmove without wind and turned red from\nthe roots at a visible speed. Its eyes\nalso began to glow red. A moment later,\na vicious dog with red fur all over its\nbody, glowing red eyes, and exuding an\nominous aura appeared in front of Fong\nYu. Seeing this terrifying appearance,\nFun Yu couldn't help but swallow hard\nand said, \"All right, all right. I know\nyou're powerful. Just turn back to your\noriginal form.\" Then Alpha slowly\ntransformed back into its golden\nretriever form. \"So, you can transform\nnow?\" Funu asked curiously. \"Woof!\" the\ndog nodded. \"After transforming, will\nyour combat power skyrocket?\" \"Woof!\nWoof!\" the dog proudly raised its head.\nAfter transforming, will I be able to\ndefeat that giant dragon to the south?\nThe dog lowered its head again and gave\nFong Yu a look as if he were an idiot.\nWhy don't you let me go up to the sky\nand stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the\nsun. He he just kidding. Just kidding.\nFong Yu patted the dog's head and said,\n\"Let's go to the mine.\" The crows had\ngone far away. The snow on the ground\nwas still deep and the forest was still\nsilent, creating a scene reminiscent of\na place where all birds have vanished\nfrom the mountains and all human tracks\nhave disappeared from the paths.\nHowever, Fongu quite like this tranquil\nfeeling. Some people like lively\natmospheres, while others prefer quiet.\nFongu belongs to the latter, which is\nwhy he has never actively sought out\nother players. The man and the dog\nquickly and smoothly arrived at the mine\nentrance. But Fongu was somewhat worried\nwhen he saw what lay behind the mine.\nShould we tell Steve and the others that\ntheir hometown, Yorktown, has actually\nbeen destroyed? Fongu knew that this\nnews would be a heavy blow to those\nghosts who longed for peace. So, after\ncareful consideration, he decided not to\nsay anything for the time being. After\nall, he had only heard Valentina mention\nit and hadn't actually seen the town\ndestroyed. It wasn't that he didn't\ntrust Valentina. He was just fantasizing\nthat perhaps after the town of York was\ndestroyed, someone had rebuilt it in\nrecent years. Therefore, Fongu decided\nto wait until he personally visited the\ntown before telling the ghosts what he\nsaw with his own eyes. After entering\nthe mine, Fongu looked around but didn't\nsee the ghosts, guessing they had all\ngone down into the mine tunnels to mine.\nHowever, he noticed that the five\nforging furnaces he had placed were\nburning fiercely. So he went over to\ntake a look. Iron or 57 currently being\nsmelted. 57 minutes and 21 seconds\nremaining. Iron ingot 43 available for\npickup. Pickup or not. There were five\nforging furnaces each containing 500\npieces of iron or being smelted. Based\non the current price ratio, one piece of\niron or can be exchanged for\napproximately five pieces of wood. In\nother words, the iron ore in these five\nforges is worth 2,500 pieces of wood.\nNot only that, Fong Yu also discovered\nthat each forging furnace was stuffed\nfull of coal. That's 500 units of coal.\nAlthough some had already burned, one\nunit of coal could easily be exchanged\nfor two units of wood. This meant that\nthis coal was worth another 1,000 units\nof wood. This is worth 3,500 pieces of\nwood. Fong Yu also discovered a pile of\nrubble, yellow sulfur ore, black coal,\nand a small pile of iron ore, silver\nore, and gold ore behind the forging\nfurnace. Funu gasped. He walked to the\nmountain of ore, and began to collect\nit. What you obtained? 850 gravel, 255\ncoal, 258 iron ore, 127 sulfur ore, 55\nsilver, or 21 gold ore. Fongu was so\nexcited after collecting the supplies\nthat he almost jumped up. He roughly\ncalculated that all these ores plus the\nores being smelted in the forge were\nworth about 5,000 to 6,000 pieces of\nwood. This is just the output of the\nghost miners in one day. Holy crap, Fong\nYu blurted out a national treasure. He\nfelt no different from winning 5 million\nin the lottery. If there had been music,\nhe probably would have started dancing\nright away. Invincible is the loneliness\nof touching more and more. After\ncollecting the supplies, Fong Yu, who\nhad nothing to do, wandered around the\nmine again and finally decided to repair\nthe miner's little wooden hut. Although\nit wouldn't make much difference to the\nghost miners whether the hut was\nrepaired or not. Funu felt that since\nthey had helped him mine so much or it\nwould be unreasonable not to show some\nappreciation. Dilapidated miners hut.\nRepair requirements 99.999/500\nwood 3610/200\ngravel 221/20\niron ingots reparable. Before leaving Fu\nput the extra wood in the warehouse,\nleaving only a whole set of wood on his\nperson. After all, backpack space was\nlimited and every spare space was\nvaluable. So Fongi waved his hand and\ndirectly chose to repair it. In an\ninstant, the dilapidated wooden house\nbegan to fall apart, and then new planks\nand rubble were automatically erected.\nBefore long, a brand new wooden house\nappeared in front of Fong Yu. Looking at\nthe brand new wooden house, Fongu went\ninside and took a look around. He\nglanced at Steve's skeleton lying on the\nnew bed and shook his head slightly.\nRegardless of whether the town still\nexists or not, he intends to properly\nbury the remains of those minors ghosts.\nAs the saying goes, it is only polite to\nreciprocate. These minors ghosts have\nbrought him enormous profits, so he\nshould do his duty and contribute his\nmodest efforts to them. Chapter 45.\nEntering the mine. Looking at the dark\nentrance to the mine, Fun Yu felt a\nlittle apprehensive, but he knew that\nthe ghost miners were also down there,\nand Alfa was with him, so he wasn't too\nafraid. He simply walked into the mine\nwith his torch in hand. After passing\nthe section of road that had been\ndestroyed by explosives, the rotten\nwooden beams and rusty tracks reappeared\nand Fong Yu and Guzy followed the tracks\nunder their feet down into the\nunderground. After walking about a 100\nmeters, Fong Yu heard a clanging sound.\nHe followed the sound and soon saw a\nghost miner swinging a pickaxe at a\npiece of or beside the mine tunnel.\nFongu looked closely and realized that\nthe minerals in the rock wall were\nactually quite inconspicuous, only\nappearing to be redder than other\nplaces. After getting closer, he could\nsee that the red substance seemed to be\nrust. Lmonite ore requires a stone\npickaxe or higher to mine, yielding iron\nore, which is then smelted in a forge to\nobtain iron ingots. At this moment, the\nghost miner also noticed the light from\nthe torch in Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s hand and\nturned to look at him. Oh, Mr. Fong Yu,\nwhat brings you here? This ghost miner\nwas none other than Ghost Steve. Fongu\nsmiled slightly at Steve and said, I was\nthinking of coming down to help bring\nthe remains of your co-workers to the\nsurface. Steve was deeply moved upon\nhearing this. He put down his pickaxe\nand said with emotion, \"Mr. Fongu, you\nare so kind. I am so happy for my fellow\nworkers. He Fong Yu chuckled sheepishly\nand said, \"I feel it's what I should\ndo.\" What Fun Yu didn't know was that\nthe people in this world had their own\ncustoms. One of which was that if a\nminor died in the mine, his family\nneeded to enter the mine to bring out\nhis body for burial so that he could\ntruly rest in peace. To outsiders, a\nmine where someone has perished is an\nominous place and no one would want to\ngo in. So in Ghost Steve's view, Fong\nYu&lt;unk&gt;s willingness to come down from\nthe underground and bring their remains\nup meant that he treated them as his own\nfamily, which was incredibly touching.\nSo Steve led Fong Yu deeper into the\nmine. Along the way, they encountered\nseveral ghosts who were mining. After\nSteve explained Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s purpose,\nthe ghosts were very moved and put down\ntheir work to help Fong Yu search for\ntheir remains deep in the mine. With the\nhelp of the ghosts, Fong Yu searched for\nhalf a day and finally found the remains\nof eight miners with only one set of\nremains remaining. During the half-day\nsearch, Fong Yu had explored the\nunderground mine and was deeply\nimpressed. The mine with its\ninterconnected and crisscrossing paths\nwas like a maze. If it weren't for the\nghosts guiding him, he would have been\n100% lost here. After discussing with\nthe other ghosts for a while, Steve said\nto Fong Yu, \"Mr. Fong you. There is only\nthe remains of the last worker left, but\nit is too difficult to obtain the\nremains of the last worker. We feel that\nyou really don't need to take that risk\nfor us. Fong Yu raised an eyebrow and\nasked, \"What's the situation with the\nremains of the last worker?\" Steve\npointed to a ghost beside him and said,\n\"The last coworker was Ivanov. That's\nhim. He was our team's demolition\nexpert. He was the one who blew up the\nentrance to the underground world during\nthe last demolition mission and he\nhimself fell into the underground world\nbecause of that accident. The ghost\nbeing pointed at looked ashamed and\nsaid, \"It's all my fault. I caused\neveryone to die here.\" Steve patted Ivon\noff on the shoulder and said, \"That was\nan accident that no one could control.\nWe don't blame you.\" \"The underground\nworld,\" Fongu murmured. What exactly is\nthe underground world like? Steve shook\nhis head and said, \"Actually, none of us\nhave ever been to the underground\nworld.\" After Ivanov blew opened the\nentrance to the underground world, the\nmonsters from the underground world\nquickly ran into the mine through the\nentrance, and we could only run for our\nlives as soon as possible. But\nunfortunately, none of them were able to\nescape. Fongu frowned and asked, \"What\nexactly are those monsters like?\" Upon\nhearing this, the ghosts began to\ndescribe it one after another. They have\ndisgusting green skin. They are very\ntall and very strong. It has claws and\nsharp teeth and terrifying red eyes.\nThey also use weapons. Most importantly,\nthere are a huge number of them,\nhundreds or even thousands. Hearing the\nghosts descriptions, Funu felt a little\npanicked. Putting everything else aside,\nthe fact that those monsters can use\nweapons proves that they are\nintelligent. This makes them worlds\napart from ordinary wild beasts. If we\nwere to deal with it, the difficulty\nwould naturally be much greater. What's\nmore, there are hundreds or even\nthousands of them. How can we even play?\nFortunately, Steve then said, \"Don't\nworry, those monsters have been gone for\nmany years. If they were still around, I\nwouldn't have let you dig the tunnel.\"\nFongu nodded and said, \"Take me to the\nentrance to that underground world.\" So,\nunder the protection of several ghosts,\nFun Yu arrived at the end of the tunnel.\n\"Watch out for the holes in the ground.\nThose are the entrances to the\nunderground world,\" Steve warned. Fong\nYu carefully approached the edge of the\ncave entrance, holding a torch, and\nlooked down. The cave entrance is an\nirregular circle about 3 m in diameter.\nBelow it is a sloping area full of\njagged rocks. And if you get close, you\ncan hear a howling sound like ghosts\nwailing. Are you sure there are no\nmonsters down there? Fongu asked\nnervously. It's gone, a ghost said. Then\nwhy are there strange sounds? The ghost\nexplained. There's a rift valley 5 m\nbelow the slope, which is why there's a\nwind sound, but it sounds like a\nmonster's howl. Ivanov rolled down the\nslope and fell into the rift valley.\nUpon hearing this, Fongu instinctively\ntook a step back. He didn't want to roll\ndown the slope as well. How deep is that\nrift valley? Funu asked again. The ghost\nshook its head and said, \"About 100 m.\"\n\"1100 m is roughly the height of a\n30story building. If you were to fall\nfrom there, you would certainly die.\"\n\"Then how should I get down?\" Funu asked\nagain. At this moment, another ghost\nsaid, \"There is a path leading down\nbeside the rift, and those monsters came\nup from that path.\" since they had\nalready pointed out the way down and\nwere looking at him eagerly. Funu could\nonly grit his teeth and say, \"Okay, then\nI'll go down and take a look.\" As he\nspoke, Fongu took out 10 torches from\nhis backpack, lit them one by one, and\nhanded them to the ghosts. I'll need\nyour help to lead the way in a bit. The\nghosts nodded, holding torches, and\nentered the cave first, followed closely\nby Fong Yu and Guzy. Chapter 46. the\nunderground world. Fong Yu considered\nhimself to have a rich enough\nimagination as a novelist, but he never\nimagined that he would be exploring the\nunknown underground world with a group\nof ghosts. Fongu followed the ghosts\ndown the steep path along the edge of\nthe Rift Valley for more than 10\nminutes. Although it was called a path,\nit was actually a series of bumpy, rocky\nslopes. It was truly nerve-wracking as a\nslight misstep could lead to eternal\nregret. Finally reaching the bottom of\nthe rift, Funyu plopped down on the\nground. The saying going up is easy, but\ngoing down is hard was no exaggeration.\nHis calves were numb and sore while the\nghosts didn't have this problem. They\nfloated, which made Fong Yu somewhat\nenvious. After rubbing his legs for a\nwhile, Fongu looked up at the torch he\nhad stuck in the cliff before coming\ndown. It was now as small as a\nmatchstick. This height is probably more\nthan 100 m, which is equivalent to more\nthan 30 floors. Fong Yu groaned inwardly\nat the thought of having to climb up\nagain later, but there was nothing he\ncould do. It was his own choice to come\ndown, and no one forced him, so he could\nonly sigh. Alas, you reap what you sow.\nGuided by the ghosts, Fongu quickly\nfound Ivanov's remains at the foot of\nthe cliff. However, collecting his\nremains was difficult because they were\nscattered everywhere. After listening to\nthe ghost's explanation, Fong Yu\nrealized that there were many creatures\nin this underground world. Ivanov's body\nmust have been eaten by these creatures\nafter he fell, which is why his bones\nwere scattered everywhere. Seeing\nIvanov's gruesome body, Fongu sighed\ndeeply. \"In old terms, this kind of\ndeath would mean dying without a\ncomplete corpse. It was a very tragic\nway to die. Fortunately, Ivanov's ghost\nwas also present. With its guidance and\nthe help of other ghosts, Fong Yu\nfinally managed to collect most of\nIvanov's remains. However, upon piecing\nthem together, he discovered that the\nmost important part was missing. One\nskull is still missing. Ghost Ivanov\nsaid, \"Do you know where the skull\nwent?\" Funu asked. Ivanov nodded and\nsaid, \"There's a large underground rat\nliving in this rift valley because it\nlives in the crevices of the rocks. It's\ncalled a rock rat.\" I remember one of\nthe rock rats carried my skull back to\nits den. A very large underground rock\nrat. Fong Yu swallowed hard and asked,\n\"How big is that rock rat?\" Ivanov\nplaced his hands in front of his chest\nand gestured, indicating that it was\nabout half a meter long. \"Is this even a\nrat? Even a cat wouldn't be that big.\"\n\"If I'm not mistaken, those rock rats\nshould also be social animals, right?\"\nFunu asked, frowning. Ivanov nodded. He\nknew it was too dangerous to retrieve\nhis head from the rat's nest, so he\noffered, \"Let's just forget about it. It\ndoesn't really make much difference if\nwe lose a head.\" Funu knew that Ivanov\nwas trying to comfort him. The skull was\nundoubtedly the most important part of\nthe remains. Without it, the remains\nwould be incomplete. So, after careful\nconsideration, he asked, \"Do you know\nwhat those rock rats are afraid of?\" The\nghosts exchanged glances and one of them\nsaid, \"I know those rats are afraid of\nlight and fire. Are you afraid of light\nand fire?\" Fongu breathed a sigh of\nrelief. There were 10 torches here, and\nthere were spares in his backpack. If\nall else failed, he could also light the\ndry grass, branches, and what he had in\nhis backpack, which should be enough to\ndrive away the rats. Then, Fu looked at\nthe dog beside him, which was currently\nhis most reliable companion. Can you\nhandle those rats? Funu asked. Alpha.\nWoof. The dog raised its head and nodded\nconfidently. In that case, Fong Yu\nturned to Ivanov and said, \"Then you\nlead the way. We've come all this way.\nWe can't just give up at the last\nminute, right?\" Upon hearing this, Ghost\nIvanov's eyes welled up with tears. He\nnodded solemnly and said, \"Thank you,\nMr. Fong Yu.\" Then led by Ivanov, Fong\nYu and the other ghosts headed toward a\ncave at the bottom of the rift valley.\nAccording to Ivanov, the rat's nest was\nin that cave. Fortunately, the cave\nwasn't too small, and it seemed to be a\nnatural cave, not dug by rats. Seven\nghosts carried torches and walked in\nfront, while three ghosts brought up the\nrear for Fong Yu. After passing through\nthe cave, Fongu arrived at a dark and\ndamp cave. As soon as he entered, he saw\na small mountain made up of all sorts of\nshiny things piled up in the open space\nin the center of the cave. Upon closer\ninspection, those glittering things\nturned out to be valuable items such as\ncrystals, gold ore, and silver ore. On\nthat small hill lay a huge fat golden\nrat as big as a pig. And on its head was\na glittering golden jeweled crown. \"Holy\ncrap,\" Fong Yu exclaimed in surprise.\nWhat's going on? Steve, who was standing\nnearby, replied, \"That's the king of\nthis rock rat pack and also a rare\ngolden rock rat.\" At this moment, the\nrat king, who was fast asleep, was also\nawakened by Fong Yu and the ghosts who\nbroke into the cave. When it opened its\neyes, it found that someone had actually\nbroken into its territory with a torch.\nSo, it immediately screamed. In an\ninstant, pairs of crimson eyes emerged\nfrom every corner of the cave. At a\nrough glance, there were probably\nhundreds of them. At the same time, Fong\nYu also heard the squeaking of mice\naround him. They were surrounded by a\nswarm of rats. Although they were all\nholding torches at the rat king&lt;unk&gt;s\ncommand, the giant rats still emerged\nfrom the shadows and surrounded Fong Yu\nand the ghosts. Just then, Alpha, the\nmongrel dog at Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s feet,\nsuddenly rushed towards the rat king in\nthe center of the cave. Before the Rat\nKing could react, Alpha had already\nleaped and pounced on it, its sharp\nclaws pressing directly onto the Rat\nKing's head. Alpha then bared its fangs\nand let out a low growl. Squeak, squeak,\nsqueak. The Rat King realized that the\ndog stepping on its head posed a threat\nto its life. It disregarded its fallen\ncrown and let out a shriek. At the rat\nking&lt;unk&gt;s call, the surrounding rats\nretreated back into the shadows. Haha,\nwell done. Fong Yu praised Alpha, who\nhad already subdued the rat king. Your\nmove of capturing the king first is\nbrilliant. After the rat king was\nsubdued by Alpha, the rat horde calmed\ndown. Fong Yu then told Ivanov to\nquickly find his head. Soon after,\nIvanov dug out a skull from the treasure\npile beneath the rat king. \"Found it,\"\nIvanof exclaimed joyfully. At this\nmoment, Fong Yu also arrived at the\ntreasure pile on the rat king's bed and\ncasually picked up a piece of red\ncrystal to study. Fire crystal, a\ncrystal containing fire attribute energy\nfound in the underground world. It is\nrare and primarily used in magical\ntechnology such as enchanting. H looks\nlike a good thing. Fongu also noticed\nthat the name of the fire crystal was\nblue, which means it was grade four, a\nrare grade. How come there are so many\ncrystals in this rat's nest? Funu asked\ncuriously. Ivanov explained, \"According\nto the records of our ancestors, the\nunderground world is rich in these\nelemental crystals, but generally only\ndwarves are able to mine these rare\nelemental crystals.\" \"Dwarves,\" Fongu\nraised an eyebrow. He remembered what\nValentina had told him about the various\nraces in this world. \"Dwarves seem to be\na kind of subhuman race that lived\nunderground.\" Yes, Steve said from the\nside. This world has not only humans and\ndwarves, but also elves, orcs, dragons,\nand many other races, and we humans are\nthe weakest among them. Chapter 47. The\ndeal with the golden-haired rat king.\nAlpha may seem like a silly husky to\nFongu, but to other animals, especially\nintelligent ones, it is an extremely\nterrifying creature. After all, Alpha\npossesses legitimate demonic blood, and\nbloodline suppression is particularly\nevident in the animal kingdom. The giant\ngolden rat, which was much larger than\nAlpha, was now trembling and crawling\nunder Alpha's paws, watching helplessly\nas Funyu filled his backpack with the\nelemental crystals and various rare ores\nit had painstakingly collected. It\nsqueaked anxiously, but dared not move\nan inch. received 12 fire crystals, 11\ncrystal stones, 15 earth crystals, 12\nwood crystals, nine gold crystals, 85\nsilver or 52 gold or eight myithil or\none dungeon key. Backpack capacity\n2730ths.\nLooking at the system notification of\nhis harvest, Fong Yu was overjoyed. It\nwas another huge harvest. Thankfully, I\nupgraded my backpack. Otherwise, I\nreally wouldn't have been able to fit\nall this stuff in. Although Fong Yu\ndoesn't need these high-grade materials\nfor the time being, he believes he will\nneed them someday. So, he accepts them\nall without keeping a single one, etc.\nUpon closer inspection, Fong Yu\ndiscovered that there seemed to be a\nstrange object mixed in with the loot. A\nkey to the underground palace. What is\nthat? The treasure key to the\nunderground palace. The underground\nworld is full of unknown and mysterious\nareas. This key may be able to open a\ntreasure chest in some underground\npalace. H there's a palace underground\nand treasure chests. Funu raised an\neyebrow. His intuition told him that\nthis key must be a good thing. But he\ndidn't have the strength to explore the\nunderground world yet. He would wait for\na chance later. So he put the key away.\nAfter Fong Yu ruthlessly collected all\nthe ores and crystals under the golden\nrat, the giant golden rat shed tears of\nreluctance. Fong Yu looked at the golden\ngiant rat with tears streaming down its\nface and felt quite embarrassed. He\nwalked closer to the golden giant rat\nand took a closer look. Golden rock rat,\nthe royalty of rock rats, possessing a\ncertain level of intelligence with a\nstrong interest in rare minerals and\ngold and silver treasures. Able to\nkeenly detect nearby mineral veins and\ntreasures. Gluttonous and timid. Um,\nFongu raised an eyebrow. He really\nhadn't expected that this fat, chubby\nrat was actually a member of the royal\nfamily of rock rats. More importantly,\nit actually had the ability to detect\nmineral veins and treasures. That's a\nreally good skill. Immediately, Fong\nYu&lt;unk&gt;s eyes lit up and he had the idea\nof subduing this rat king. So, he took\nout a few pieces of roasted spider meat\nfrom his backpack, which he used to feed\nhis dog, and waved them around, saying,\n\"I can't just take your things for\nnothing. Here, have some good food. The\ngolden rat king initially scoffed at the\nspider meat Fong Yu had offered, but\nthen its nostrils twitched slightly, as\nif it had smelled something. Immediately\nafterward, its eyes widened as it looked\nat the roasted spider meat in Fong\nYu&lt;unk&gt;s hand. At Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s signal,\nAlpha removed its paw from the golden\nrat king&lt;unk&gt;s head. So, the golden rat\nking struggled to his feet, slowly moved\nto Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s side, and brought his\nnose to the roasted meat to sniff. Want\nsome?\" Funu asked. The Golden Rat King\nnodded. Fong Yu then handed over the\nroasted meat, and the golden rat king\nquickly snatched it up and started\ngnawing on it. In no time, a large piece\nof roasted meat was eaten by the giant\ngolden rat. Immediately, the golden rat\nking looked at the remaining roasted\nmeat in Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s hand again. At\nthis moment, it no longer looked sad at\nall. Its eyes were full of the roasted\nmeat in Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s hand, and it even\nstuck out its tongue to lick the meat\nscraps from its mouth. Throughout its\nlong life, the Golden Rat King ate the\ncorpses of various fungi or insects that\nthe rats of its tribe brought from the\nunderground world. Occasionally, it\ncould also eat some scraps of animal\nmeat, but it had never tasted delicious\nroasted meat that had been cooked and\nsprinkled with various seasonings.\nTherefore, the rat king&lt;unk&gt;s taste buds\nwere immediately conquered by the\nroasted meat in Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s hands.\nFong Yu smiled slightly as he looked at\nthe impatient rat king and tossed all\nthe roasted meat in his hand to the rat\nking. The rat king didn't care about\nanything else and immediately pounced on\nthe roasted meat, starting to eat\nheartily. The way they ate made even\nFong Yu a little hungry while Alpha next\nto him stuck out his tongue and licked\nhis lips. Seeing this, Fong Yu took out\nanother piece of roasted wild boar meat\nthat he was eating and handed it to\nAlpha, saying, \"I know you're drooling\nover it, too. Here, have a piece.\"\nHowever, to Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s surprise,\nafter Alpha glanced at the roasted meat\nin Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s hand, it actually\nturned its head away arrogantly. Fong Yu\nwas slightly taken aback. Then he\nunderstood, \"Haha, it seems Alpha thinks\nit's beneath it to eat meat with this\nfat rat. Haha, I didn't realize you were\nsuch a classy dog. Fong Yu then put away\nthe roasted wild boar meat and turned to\nlook at the ghosts who were waiting for\nhim. Please wait a moment. I need to\ntalk to this rat. No, I mean the rat\nking for a while longer. Ghost Steve\nsmiled slightly and said, \"Of course,\nyou can talk for as long as you want.\nTime is the last thing we need.\" Funu\nturned to look at the rat king. In less\nthan two minutes, the creature had\ndevoured all five pieces of roasted\nspider meat that Fongu had given it. It\nwas now lying there, scratching the\ngolden fur on its belly with its short\nfront paws. \"Is it good?\" Funu asked.\nThe rat king squeaked a few times, and\nit was clear that this guy understood\nhuman speech. \"I just don't know where\nhe learned to speak human speech. Do you\nstill want to eat?\" Funu asked again.\nSqueak, squeak, squeak. Upon hearing\nthis, the rat king immediately perked up\nand nodded vigorously. Seeing the rat\nking&lt;unk&gt;s reaction, Fongu revealed a\nmeaningful smile. If you want more,\nthat's fine, but we can make a deal. The\nrat king was slightly taken aback, then\nlooked around. However, all of its\ncollection had been taken by Fong Yu,\nleaving only a crown on the ground. The\nrat king looked at the crown on the\nground, hesitated for a moment, then\npicked it up with its mouth, and came to\nFong Yu. its meaning quite clear. It\neven gave up its crown for the sake of\ndelicious food. He I didn't realize you\nwere such a foodie. Funu laughed. Keep\nthe crown. I don't need it. Perhaps this\ncrown is attractive enough to those who\ncrave power. After all, it symbolizes\npower and status, but it holds no appeal\nfor Fongu. Then Fu revealed his purpose.\nHow about this? From now on, you have\nyour rats collect more rare ores and\nelemental crystals, and I'll trade you\nroasted meat for them. One piece of\nroasted meat for two pieces of silver\nore, or two pieces of gold ore, and two\npieces of roasted meat for one elemental\ncrystal or one piece of myithril ore.\nWhat do you think? Chapter 48. Waiting\nfor iron ore prices to appreciate. The\nrat king had no objection to the terms\nof the deal proposed by Fong Yu. Even if\nits little brain was big enough, it\nwouldn't know the true value of those\nores and elemental crystals. Not to\nmention the rat king. Even Fong Yu was\nunaware of the specific value and uses\nof these rare minerals and crystals. So,\nthe rat king simply lowered his head and\nthought for a while before nodding to\nFong Yu. Although the rat king liked\nthese shiny things, compared to the\ndelicious roasted meat, these things\nthat could only be looked at were not\nvery appealing. Deal. Fong Yu clapped\nhis hands and said, \"Then gave the rat\nking the remaining dozen or so pieces of\nroasted meat in his backpack, saying,\n\"Consider this the exchange for what I\ntook from you earlier. Although it's not\nenough to offset the debt, consider the\nextra as compensation for sparing your\nlife. Is that all right?\" The rat king\nglanced at Alpha, who was standing\nbeside him, watching him intently. What\ncould he say? He could only nod\nhelplessly. In fact, Fongu could have\ntried to tame the rat king and bring it\nback to the haunted house in the forest\nas his pet. He believed that with\nAlpha's threat, the rat king would not\ndare to disobey. However, if they did\nthat, the rat king would inevitably feel\nresistant because the system\nnotification said that it possessed a\ncertain level of intelligence. Moreover,\nits talent lies in exploring mineral\nveins and finding treasures. Alpha also\npossesses the ability to find treasures.\nSo Fong Yu doesn't care. As for the\nability to explore mineral veins,\nalthough it's very useful, once you find\nthem, you still have to dig them out\nyourself, right? For Shin Yuyu, mining\nis out of the question, he'll never do\nit again in his life. As a professional\nnovelist, he already has a bad back, and\nasking him to mine would be like taking\nhis life. Therefore, leaving the rat\nking here to manage its rat population\nand help it find ores and crystals is\nundoubtedly the best solution at\npresent. Having achieved his goal, Fong\nYu bid farewell to the rat king and\nunder the protection of the ghosts\nembarked on his journey back to the\nground. After Fong Yu returned to the\nsurface with the remains of 10 ghosts,\nhe finally told the ghosts the news that\nYorktown had been destroyed by the\ndragon. Upon hearing the news, the 10\nghosts all showed expressions of\ndespair. After all, that was their home,\nthe town where their loved ones lived,\nand it was gone just like that,\ndestroyed by a dragon. They were buried\nin the dark, sunless mines for nearly a\ncentury. Their only wish being to one\nday return to their roots and homeland.\nBut now, that homeland has vanished just\nlike that. For a moment, these ghosts\nfound it hard to accept. Seeing this,\nFong Yu quickly comforted him. Of\ncourse, I've only heard about it, and I\ncan't confirm the specifics yet. I\npromise you, after winter is over, I'll\nfind an opportunity to go to Yorktown to\nsee what the situation is like there,\nand then I'll come back and tell you,\"\nthe ghosts looked at Fong Yu, and Steve,\nthe leader, said with a sorrowful\nexpression, \"Then we&lt;unk&gt;ll have to\ntrouble you.\" After bidding farewell to\nthe ghosts in the mine, Fong Yu and Alfa\nwalked through the snow-covered forest\nand returned to the cabin. It was\nalready afternoon. Fong Yu put the\nsupplies from his backpack into the\nwarehouse and then put all the smeltable\nores into the forging furnace to start\nsmelting. Finally, he went to the\nbathroom to take a shower. There was no\nway around it. The dust in the mine and\nthe underground world was just too much,\nand he was covered in sweat from\nclimbing up and down. The feeling of the\ndust sticking to his skin was extremely\nuncomfortable. After taking care of the\nhousehold chores, Fongu started cooking.\nWhile he was cooking, he opened the chat\nchannel and browsed through everyone's\nmessages again. Today is the last day of\nthe winter challenge. Most of the\nplayers who have survived until now have\nmade it through the winter safely, so\nthe atmosphere in the chat channel is\nrelatively normal. Everyone is\ndiscussing what the future holds for\nthis survival game. Among them, several\nclever players mentioned other regions.\nZhao Ming ID211. The winter challenge\nends tonight. What challenges do you\nthink the system will arrange for us\nnext? Wu Baoang ID7876.\nWho knows? That system is so mysterious.\nWho knows what kind of crazy challenges\nit will arrange for us. Lee Chin Long\nID212. Putting everything else aside,\nthere's one thing the system will\nprobably arrange sooner or later. Chin\nXiaoyu ID9. What content is it? Xiao\nYini ID909. Tell me quickly what is it?\nLi Chong Leong ID 888. Quickly say plus\n10,086.\nLi Chinlong ID 212. You guys should have\nall noticed the world chat channel,\nright? Including our region, there are a\ntotal of 10 regions. Although each\nregion is independent now, I guess the\nsystem will eventually open up channels\nbetween the various regions. Liakai\nID573\nand then what lead Shunlong ID212. Based\non my years of gaming experience, there\nwill definitely be competition between\ndifferent regions. Although I don't know\nthe specifics of the competition yet, it\ncertainly won't be peaceful. Once this\nguy named Lee Shunlong brought up the\ntopic, the chat channel immediately\nbecame lively with all the players\nspeculating about what kind of\ncompetition would emerge once the new\nserver opened. Fong Yu, who already knew\nthe information, simply smiled and after\nthinking for a moment, decided to remind\neveryone. Fong UD006,\nsince this is a survival game, if there\nis any competitive content, it will most\nlikely be related to survival. So, I\nguess the competitive content is likely\nto be the number of survivors in each\nregion or a competition for the total\namount of resources collected. Fa was\nquite famous in the area, especially\nafter he shared his method for capturing\ncrows in the chat channel, which earned\nhim a lot of goodwill. So, his words\ncarried a lot of weight. And since his\nwords were also very logical, most\npeople agreed with him for a while.\nSeeing this, Fongu typed out a second\nmessage. Fong Uid006.\nSince there will be a competition, there\nshould also be rewards and punishments.\nSo, I suggest that everyone wait until\nwinter ends tomorrow and speed up the\ncollection of resources. We don't need\nto get rewards, but at least we can't\nget punished, right? This statement also\nsparked discussion, but many people\ncomplained about how difficult it was to\ncollect supplies, and some people who\nwanted to take advantage of the\nsituation asked Fong Yu to help them\nout. Regarding how to improve the\nefficiency of collecting resources,\nFongu suggested upgrading tools.\nPreviously, stone axes and pickaxes\nshould be upgraded to iron axes and\npickaxes. This would double the\nefficiency of collecting resources, and\niron tools are also much more durable\nthan stone tools. The key issue is that\ncrafting iron tools requires iron ore,\nand if everyone in the area wants to\nupgrade their iron tools, then a huge\namount of iron ore will be needed.\nHowever, there aren't many players near\ntheir spawn point who have mines or iron\nor veins. Moreover, Fongu already knew\nthat the subsequent upgrades to the\nwooden house would also require a large\nnumber of iron ingots. Therefore, it is\nforeseeable that the price of iron or\nwill rise sharply in the next few days.\nWhen he returned from the mine, he also\nbrought back 500 iron ingots smelted in\nthe five forging furnaces in the mine,\nplus 258 unsmelted iron ore and 200 iron\nore he had bought before. In other\nwords, he now had a storage of 958 iron\ningots. In addition, the ghost miners in\nthe mine will dig out large amounts of\niron, ore, and other ores for him every\nday. Tsk tsk looks like we're about to\nmake a fortune again. Chapter 49, melee\ncombat isn't for me. In addition to\nadvising other players to upgrade their\ntools and houses as soon as possible,\nFun Yu also suggested that players\nexplore the environment around their\nhouses more. Based on his personal\nexperience, the resources that can be\nobtained through exploration are far\ngreater than those obtained by simply\ncutting down trees and digging for\nstones. However, safety must be taken\nseriously. He also shared that he can\nmake bows and arrows and will then make\na batch of bows and arrows to sell on\nthe exchange to help other players\nimprove their survivability. Of course,\nthis is also a form of advertising. He\nwill price the bow and arrow at twice\nthe cost, which should allow him to make\na small profit. This kind of operation\nwasn't just being done by Fong Yu. Many\nother players also obtained crafting\nblueprints for green grade equipment or\nweapons such as chain mail, fine iron\nswords, and spears and then made a\nprofit by crafting those items. This is\na reasonable redistribution of market\nresources. As long as the price isn't\ntoo exorbitant and remains between two\nand three times the cost, most people\nwon't have any objections. As for those\nguys who wanted to get something for\nnothing and tried to add Fong Yu as a\nfriend to ask for supplies, Fong Yu\nsimply ignored them. Talking to those\nguys was a waste of time. Moreover, the\nmore someone likes to take advantage of\nothers, the less grateful they are. They\nare the most ungrateful. Fong Yu had\nalso heard a saying, \"Generosity towards\nthose who want something for nothing is\nthe greatest disrespect to those who\nwork hard.\" As Fong Yu prepared the\ningredients, he interacted with everyone\nin the chat channel. And soon it was\nevening. Dinner was naturally the spicy\nhot pot that he hadn't eaten much of\nlast night. Because he couldn't hold his\nliquor, he hadn't actually eaten much\nlast night. So tonight, he decided not\nto drink and to enjoy a proper spicy hot\npot meal. To be honest, that bottle of\nrum really changed Fong Yu's\nunderstanding of alcohol. Yesterday, he\nonly had one glass, which was no more\nthan 2 oz, and he thought he couldn't\npossibly get drunk, but he fell asleep\nin less than 5 minutes. It seems this\n60-year-old vintage is no joke. Let's\nsave this wine for future special props.\nWhen Fong Yu brought the ingredients to\nthe hot pot in the living room, the\nghost Valentine, the skeleton Ryan, and\nthe dog Alpha were already gathered\naround the hot pot. Even the little\nspider Sakura slid down from the roof\nbeam along the silk threads. And so a\nnew hot pot dinner began. While eating\nhot pot, Fong Yu and his three friends\nsuggested that they leave the woods and\ngo to find Yorktown. Do you think it's\nokay? Fong Yu asked for the opinions of\nhis three companions, mainly the\nopinions of the ghost Valentina since\nshe was the only one who could speak at\nthe moment. Valentina hesitated for a\nmoment, then said, \"Master, although I\nunderstand that you want to help those\nghosts fulfill their wishes, it is still\ntoo dangerous for you to go to Yorktown\nright now.\" The skeleton Ryan and the\ndog Alpha, who were standing nearby,\nboth nodded in agreement. H why do you\nsay that? Funu asked, quite curious.\nActually, not long after York was\ndestroyed by the dragon, the ruins were\noccupied by a group of orcs. Going there\nnow is no different from sending\nyourself to your death. A half orc?\nFongu raised his eyebrows and said, \"I\nknow what an orc is, but what exactly is\na half orc?\" Valentina explained, \"Orcs\nhave been raiding human towns for years.\nThey not only plunder human wealth and\nfood, but also human women. Over time,\nmany descendants of humans, and orcs\nhave emerged. These descendants are\ncalled half orcs. They are despised by\norcs and driven out by humans, so they\ncan only wander around. The ruins of\nYorktown have become their home. Is that\nso? Fongu asked after eating a slice of\ncooked meat. But I've already promised\nthose ghosts. I can't go back on my\nword. Can I just go and take a look from\nafar? Upon hearing this, Valentina\nlooked down at Alpha, the mongrel dog,\nsquatting on the floor, and said,\n\"Alpha, only you can accompany your\nmaster out now. Can you protect him?\"\nUpon hearing this, Alpha immediately\nstood up from the floor and barked\nproudly. Woof! Woof! Funu asked\ncuriously, \"From what it says, there's\nno problem.\" Valentina shook her head\nand said, \"No, it just means that if you\ndie, it will avenge you.\" Valentina and\nAlfa's words successfully dissuaded Fong\nYu from going to Yorktown. Although he\nwas happy to help those ghosts fulfill\ntheir wishes, he wouldn't risk his life\nfor it. Although he didn't know exactly\nhow powerful those orcs were, the fact\nthat even Alpha couldn't guarantee his\nsafety meant that those orcs were still\nvery dangerous. Therefore, the trip to\nYorktown will have to be postponed for\nthe time being. Valentina suggested that\nthey wait until skeleton Ryan could move\nduring the day so that he and Alpha the\ndog could provide double protection for\nhim on the way to Yorktown. Fongu had\nalso witnessed Ryan's dazzling ax\nskills. To be honest, even 10 of him,\nfully armed, would probably struggle to\nwithstand Ryan's ax for more than 3\nminutes. Thinking of this, Ryan, can you\nteach me your axe wielding combat\nskills? Funu asked expectantly. Upon\nhearing this, Ryan raised his hand and\nscratched the top of his head, his chin\nbobbing as he said, \"Aba, aa.\"\nFongu turned to look at the translator,\nValentina. Valentina smiled and\ntranslated. It said, \"It's nothing\nreally. Just cut down 20 trees every\nday, and if you keep at it, you'll get\nthe hang of it eventually. You'll learn\nby just chopping.\" Funu glanced at Ryan\nwith a bewildered look, then shook his\nhead helplessly and chuckled. \"It seems\nyou must be the legendary martial arts\nprodigy to be able to comprehend such\nformidable battle axe techniques from\nthe process of chopping down a tree.\"\nTsksk, I'm afraid I could never learn\nthat. Indeed, martial arts are very\ndependent on talent. One must either be\nborn with extraordinary aptitude or have\nextremely high comprehension, and Fong\nYu is clearly not cut out for that.\nMoreover, he only chopped down 20 trees\na day on his first day in the game, and\nas a result, his back ache for three or\n4 days. It took him a couple of days to\nrecover. If he were to continue chopping\ndown trees like that, it would be no\ndifferent from killing him. Moreover,\nupon careful consideration, Fongu\nrealized that Ryan's axe combat skills\nwere not actually very suitable for him.\nSince Ryan was a skeleton, he did not\nfeel tired or in pain and could even\nregenerate after being broken apart.\nThat's why he was able to fight his way\nin and out of the spider swarm seven\ntimes. But I don't have Ryan's\nabilities. Ryan can make countless\nmistakes, but if I make just one\nmistake, I might be done for. So after\nthinking it over, Fong Yu decided that\nhe wasn't suited for close combat and\nshould stick to practicing archery. As\nfor melee combat, that'll be left to\nAlpha and Ryan from now on. One is a\nsemi-tank damage dealer. The other is a\nroaming assassin, and I, the marksman,\njust follow behind and pick up kills.\nChapter 50. New announcement. After\nenjoying a delicious spicy hot pot meal,\nFong Yu washed up, said good night to\nhis three friends, and returned to his\nbedroom, snuggling into his warm-own\ncomforter. In this harsh winter, Fong Yu\nhas a delicious hot pot to fill his\nstomach, trustworthy companions to keep\nhim company, and a spacious and warm\nwooden house to shelter him. For him,\nlife now is even better than his\nprevious lonely, reclusive life.\nMoreover, tonight is the last night of\nwinter. After tonight, the temperature\noutside should rise again tomorrow, and\nthen we can go out and have some fun\nagain. So, what should I do tomorrow?\nAmidst a flurry of random thoughts, Fong\nYu gradually drifted off to sleep. The\nnext morning, Fongu was awakened by a\nfamiliar notification sound. He\nrecognized the sound. It was the sound\nthe system made when it released\nannouncements. He suddenly snapped out\nof it and the first thing that came to\nhis mind was that with the new year\ncoming, the system must have released\nnew game content. So he immediately open\nthe game interface and check the\nannouncements. Hello dear players. First\nof all, congratulations on successfully\ncompleting the 6-day beginners period.\nThose of you who have survived should\nnow have a basic understanding of this\nsurvival game. Now the real survival\ngame begins. Below, I will introduce\nsome new game rules and information, so\nplease remember them carefully. First,\nafter passing the beginner phase, the\ngame will fully unlock the monster\nsystem. If you thought the wild boars,\nspiders, wolf packs, and flocks of crows\nyou encountered before were scary\nenough, then I'm sorry, but you may\nencounter even more terrifying monsters\nduring your exploration. Real monsters.\nSecondly, now that monsters have\nappeared, players will naturally have\nthe opportunity to become powerful or\neven heroes. Explore this lost world\nfurther. Perhaps you will encounter the\nlegacy of some powerful beings such as a\nmage, a great swordmaster, an alchemist,\nor perhaps a priest. Ah, don't ask me\nwhy it's all western fantasy heritage\nbecause this is a lost fantasy\ncontinent. As for the Eastern continent,\nof course, it exists, too. It's just\nthat if you went there now, you would\nhave almost no chance of survival. So,\nyou can think of this as your starting\nvillage. Third, a lord will be born in\neach region after 12 days. And to obtain\nthe status of a lord, one of two\nconditions must be met. One, the player\nwho acquires the most resources across\nthe entire region over the next 6 days.\nThe player who received the most votes\nfrom players in the region within 2.6\ndays. If the person who meets the first\ncondition and the person who meets the\nsecond condition are not the same\nplayer, they will engage in a life or\ndeath duel and the survivor will become\nthe lord. Of course, participants can\nalso voluntarily withdraw, giving up the\nopportunity to become the lord. Fourth,\nI believe you have already noticed that\nthis game has regional divisions. Yes,\nthis is done to increase your\ncompetitiveness. Your 10 regions will\nenter ranking mode in 12 days. After 12\ndays, the bottom five regions will be\nspawned by terrifying ferocious beasts,\nwhile the top five regions will be\nspawned by mysterious auspicious beasts.\nFifth, the top three regions in the new\nplayer period points rankings will now\nbe announced and system rewards will be\nawarded. Third place, District 8, 5,252\nsurvivors, survival value 5.252 252\nmillion. Resource acquisition value\n2.755 million. Total value 8.007\nmillion. Reward all players in the\ndistrict plus one to any attribute\npoint. Second place, zone 3, 5,677\nsurvivors. Survival value 5.677\n3.158\nmillion. Total value 8.835\nmillion. Reward all players in the zone\nplus two to any attribute point. First\nplace server 6 7,117\nsurvivors. Survival value 7.117 million.\nResource acquisition value 4.359\nmillion. Total value 11.476\nserver plus three to any attribute\npoints. Congratulations to the players\nin zones 8, 3, and six. You've gained a\ntemporary lead, but this is just the\nbeginning. Other zones, don't be\ndiscouraged. With enough effort, you\nhave every chance to overtake them. All\nright, that concludes this announcement.\nHave fun playing the game. Goodbye.\nAfter reading the system announcement,\nFong Yu fell into deep thought. The\nfirst announcement was about new\nmonsters. Although Fong Yu didn't know\nthis beforehand, he already knew from\nhis trip to the mind that the background\nof this game world was very complex. Not\nonly were there unknown monsters hidden\nin the underground world, but there was\nalso a giant dragon on the mountain to\nthe south of the forest. Moreover,\nValentina told him last night that the\nnearby town of York had been occupied by\na group of orcs. Just from the name, he\nknew that those orcs would definitely be\nmuch more difficult to deal with than\nwild boores and spiders. So, in general,\nthe first message means what came before\nwas just an appetizer. The real survival\njourney has only just begun. I bet a lot\nof players are already furious and\ncursing after seeing this announcement.\nFong Yu then glanced at the chat\nchannel. Shining ID 5175.\nHoly crap. I barely managed to survive\nand you're telling me the game has only\njust begun. Susa ID7302.\nI have a curse in my mouth, but I don't\nknow if I should say it. Wong Fong ID\n2516. This game is insane. I thought I\ncould finish the winter challenge and\nthen the game would be over. Yao Juan ID\n357. I can't take it anymore. I'm tired.\nLet's destroy it. Leong Ping ID 5566.\nWong Fong ID 2516. I thought so too.\nLooks like we were both overthinking it.\nTun Xiaoyu ID99. I want to change my job\nto a mage. Does anyone know how to do\nit? Looking at the commotion in the chat\nchannel, Fongu side, after all, this is\na survival game with a high mortality\nrate. Nearly 30% of the players have\ndied just after the newbie adaptation\nperiod. In other areas, the mortality\nrate is even close to 50%. I wonder how\nmany more people will die as the\ndifficulty increases later on.\nFortunately, the second announcement was\nundoubtedly good news for the players.\nPlayers have the opportunity to acquire\nvarious class inheritances through\nexploration, such as magician,\ngreatsword master, alchemist, and\npriest. These all sound like incredibly\npowerful classes, and it's believed that\nif players can obtain class\ninheritances, their survival rate will\nbe much higher. But the key point is,\nbut it's obvious to anyone that\nobtaining a profession's legacy isn't\neasy. It must involve venturing into\ndangerous ruins or places teeming with\nmonsters to have any chance of acquiring\nit. For example, that underground world\nhiding monsters. I seem to have also\nobtained a key to a dungeon which might\ncontain some kind of professional\ninheritance. For example, Yorktown. He\nremembered that ghost Steve had said he\nhoped to bury their remains in the\nchurch cemetery in town. So, could there\nbe a pastoral lineage in that church?\nAnd what about that dragon's lair on the\nmountain to the south? Could it also\nhold some kind of professional heritage?\nIt's highly likely, but Fong Yu also\nknew that, let alone other players. Even\nhe himself would face an extremely high\nmortality rate if he went to explore\nthose places. Now, for players who\nbarely manage to survive, it's easy to\nimagine how difficult it is to obtain a\nclass inheritance. Of course, it's\npossible that some extremely lucky\nplayers might have the chance to\nencounter a class inheritance, but\nthat's purely an isolated case and won't\nbe discussed. Therefore, Fong Yu decided\nthat his top priority was to improve his\nown strength as he did not want to fall\nbehind and be beaten. Chapter 51, the\nbest of both worlds. What Funu was most\nconcerned about was the third\nannouncement. The one who acquires the\nhighest resource value in each region\nwill become the Lord. Would my supplies\nbe the most in the entire region? Funu\nthen opened the warehouse interface and\ntook a look, finding it already filled\nwith all sorts of supplies. Good\nheavens. Before I knew it, my 30 slot\nwarehouse was almost full. I don't know\nhow much these things in the warehouse\nare worth. The total value of all items\nin your warehouse is 58,38\npoints. One point equals one unit of\nwood. Looking at the system\nnotification, Fu calculated that the\ntotal value of resources obtained in\nthis area was 4.359\nmillion divided by 7,116\npeople, which means that each other\nplayer obtained resources worth about\n613, equivalent to 613 wood, or about 60\ntrees. The beginner adaptation period\nlasts for 6 days. On average, each\nplayer can obtain about 10 trees per\nday, which means 60 trees and a total\nresource collection of about 600 points\nin 6 days. Funu, however, gained 58,38\npoints of value in those 6 days, and\nthat doesn't even include the materials\nused to upgrade his house. Otherwise, he\nwould have easily surpassed 60,000.\nThat's nearly a 100 times more than\nother players. The reason he was able to\nmake such high profits was that in\naddition to Alpha and Ryan helping him\naccumulate his first pot of gold, he\nalso made a fortune by buying low and\nselling high several times in the\nexchange. And finally, the mine ghost\nhelped him mine a large amount of high-v\nvalue ore. So, barring any unforeseen\ncircumstances, my resources should be\nthe best in the entire region, which\nmeans I will become the lord of region\n6. But what exactly is this lord? The\nsystem announcement didn't explain it\nclearly, which left Fongu scratching his\nhead. Fortunately, the game assistant\nanswered his questions immediately. The\nLord is the nominal leader of each\nregion, but the system does not force\nother players in the same region to obey\nthe Lord. How to manage the players in a\nregion is up to the Lord to figure out.\nHaha. So, you're saying this lordship is\njust a title? Completely useless. 5% of\nthe total revenue of all subjects is\npaid to the Lord. So the Lord should\nprotect his subjects well as they can\ngenerate wealth for him. However, rights\nand obligations are equal. The lord must\nrepresent his region in an annual\nlordship competition composed of lords\nfrom all regions. The winner receives a\nrich reward while defeat usually means\ndeath. After reading the game assistance\nintroduction to the lord, Fongu\ninstantly lost interest in the identity\nof the lord. The lord actually cares\nabout the lives of so many players\nacross the entire region. To be honest,\nhe has neither the interest nor the\nenergy for that. Most importantly, this\nposition, which symbolizes power and\nstatus, will definitely attract a lot of\nattention. It is the most dangerous\nposition under the spotlight. Not only\nwill players within zone 6 covet the\nlord's position, but if players from\nother zones attack, the first target\nwill definitely be the lord of this\nzone. So, this lord's position may seem\nlike a coveted prize, but it actually\nhides a deadly trap. As the saying goes,\nkeep quiet and you'll make a fortune.\nThe nail that sticks out gets hammered\ndown, and a tall tree catches the wind.\nThese proverbs all serve as a warning to\nFong Yu that he is not fit to be a lord.\nHowever, although Fong Yu didn't really\nwant to be the lord, he had too many\nresources at his disposal, and his\nreputation among the players in zone 6\nseemed to be quite good. feel. Even if\nhe doesn't want to be the lord, the\nsystem and other players will have to\nmake him one. Sigh. What a pity. Fun.\nYou sighed. It seems that sometimes\nbeing too strong can be a problem. He\neven began to consider exploiting a\nloophole in the system to send excess\nsupplies from the warehouse back to the\nmine, thereby reducing the total value\nof his resources. However, becoming a\nlord grants you 5% of the total revenue\nof the entire region, which is actually\nquite a considerable amount. Not\nbecoming a lord means handing over 5% of\nyour own revenue. So, not becoming a\nlord feels a bit like a bad deal. So,\nyou couldn't help but start thinking,\nwas there any way to get that 5% return\nwithout taking on any responsibility or\nrisk? At the very least, he had to be\nexempt from that 5% tax. Is there a way\nto have the best of both worlds? Tsktsk,\nthis is a real headache. The topic of\nthe Lord's status also sparked heated\ndebate in the chat channel. Some people\nstrongly protested against this\nautocratic system, but many more were\neager to compete for the Lord's\nposition. In fact, many players have\nalready started recruiting teammates in\nthe regional channels, preparing to form\na group first, then establish a\nsettlement, and call on everyone to vote\nfor him. After all, people like Fong Yu,\nwho prefer to make a fortune quietly and\nremain as steady as Lao Go, are in the\nminority. Most people still enjoy the\nthrill that power and status bring them,\nwhich is why so many people in ancient\ntimes wanted to become emperors. The\nfourth point in the announcement was the\ninformation about the server merge\nrankings that the game assistant had\ngiven him in advance. To be honest, Fong\nYu didn't expect that his region would\nhave the highest number of survivors and\ntake first place. But what he didn't\nknow was that this was all thanks to the\ninformation he had shared in the past\nfew days. For example, red mushrooms are\nvery effective against wild boores,\nwhich gives many players near their\nspawn points a way to deal with wild\nboores and also allows them to obtain a\nlarge amount of wild boar meat, greatly\nincreasing their survival rate. In\nparticular, his method of catching crows\nwith animal traps, which he shared in\nwinter, gave many players who were\nunable to go out to obtain supplies\nduring the winter a chance to survive.\nAlthough his primary purpose in doing\nthis was to make money, his secondary\npurpose was to reduce the number of\ndeaths in District 6 so as to prevent it\nfrom becoming a backward area and being\nattacked by ferocious beasts. But\nunintentionally, he did save the lives\nof many players in zone 6. Therefore,\nhis reputation among zone 6 players has\nreached an extremely high level. At this\nmoment, many players in the chat channel\nwho had read the announcement were\ndiscussing the topic of the lord. Almost\nall players are resistant to the lord\nsetting. After all, they were born in\nmodern democratic China and have been\nfree from feudal rule for nearly a\ncentury. Who can accept being ruled by a\nlord again? After all, no one wants to\nbe a subject who is inferior to others.\nHowever, if the system had to choose a\nlord, after much discussion, everyone\nseemed to agree that the most suitable\ncandidate was Fong Yu, who could help\nthem the most. After all, Fongu not only\ngreatly helped all the players in the\nregion, but he also didn't stand up and\ncheer for himself to get other players\nto support him as the lord. In the eyes\nof other players, Fong Yu naturally\nbecame the kind of philanthropist who\nwas willing to dedicate himself, was\nselfless, did not seek fame or fortune,\nand sacrificed himself for others.\nCompared to those ambitious players who\nwere trying to embellish their own\nreputations, and were determined to\nbecome lords, Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s silence only\nstrengthened the players in zone saxs\nresolve to make him a lord. However,\nFong Yu, the person involved, was\ncompletely unaware of this. Aside from\nthe announcement about the lord, what\nexcited Fongu the most was undoubtedly\nthe last announcement. The player ranked\nfirst in the total points of the sixth\ndistrict, and the system rewarded all\nplayers in the district with three\nattribute points. But how do we use\nthese three attributes? Thinking of\nglanced at his attributes. Name Fong Yu.\nRace: human. Attribute version 0 to 10\nrepresents an average person with an\naverage value of five. Intelligence\n7.53.\nI haven't done much work, but how do I\nincrease intelligence? It seems to be\ninnate, right? Strength 5.02.\nFinally broke the average of five. These\npast few days of hard work paid off.\nAgility 5.56. It only increased\nslightly. Looking at his attribute\npoints, Fong Yu fell into deep thought.\nWhich of these three points should be\nadded to? Currently, my weakness is\nundoubtedly strength. So, at first\nglance, it is obvious that it is most\nappropriate to add three attribute\npoints to strength. But upon closer\nreflection, if he were to add those\nthree points to his intelligence, his\nintelligence would reach 10.53,\nbreaking through the 10point upper limit\nfor ordinary people. This represents a\nqualitative leap. After thinking it\nover, just to be on the safe side, Fong\nYu still consulted the game assistant,\nXiaolu. After all, these three attribute\npoints are hard-earned, so we should be\nvery careful with them. Xiaolu, which of\nthese three attribute points should I\nuse on for new players in the early\nstages of survival? Strength and agility\nare highly recommended. This is because\nmost resource gathering methods such as\nchopping trees, mining, and other\nresource gathering are tied to strength.\nThe higher the strength, the more\nefficient you will be at these tasks.\nAgility, on the other hand, is crucial\nfor quick reaction times in dangerous\nsituations. However, with three\ncompanions protecting you, you don't\nnecessarily need to increase your\nstrength and agility. You can also\nconsider focusing on intelligence\nbecause the minimum intelligence\nrequirement to become a mage is nine,\nand the higher your intelligence, the\nbetter it is for learning and using\nmagic. After reading the game assistant\nsuggestions, Fongu had a general idea of\nwhat to expect, but he decided to wait\nuntil Valentina was able to come out\nthat evening before asking for her\nopinion, as well as Ryan and Alfus. In\nshort, we must not be too hasty. Then,\nFongu began to eat the breakfast that\nValentina had prepared for him in\nadvance. A meat sandwich with a fried\negg and berry slices sandwiched between\ntwo meat patties. This is also a simple\nand convenient breakfast that Fong Yu\ntaught Valentina. While eating his\nsandwich, Fongu started planning his\nhomework for the day. First of all,\ncutting down trees is out of the\nquestion. As the saying goes, it's easy\nto go from frugality to extravagance,\nbut difficult to go from extravagance to\nfrugality. Having already experienced\nthe high returns that exploration\nbrings, he would never do something that\ninvolves high physical labor with low\nreturns. However, simply staying cooped\nup in the house and slacking off wasn't\nan option. Although he really wanted to\nslack off the night before last,\nemboldened by alcohol, he had boasted to\nhis three companions in the house that\nhe would definitely help them recover as\nsoon as possible. We should still go out\nand explore. Maybe we'll get lucky and\nfind a treasure chest or a hidden quest.\nSo, after Fong Yu and Guzy finished\nbreakfast, they prepared to go out for a\nwalk. Spring is here. A time of renewal\nand renewal. It's time to go out and\nenjoy the fresh air. Chapter 52. The\nwonderful uses of the butcher's\ntechnique. Today is the first day of\nspring. Looking out the window of the\ncabin, the sun is shining brightly. It's\na great day to go out and explore. As\nsoon as Fong Yu pushed open the door, he\nsaw more than a dozen wild boar\ncarcasses lying neatly on the ground\nwhere the snow had melted. Fongu raised\nan eyebrow, glanced down at the alpha at\nhis feet, and asked, \"What's going on\nhere?\" Upon hearing this, the dog turned\nits head and glanced at Ryan in the\ncorner of the living room. Fongu looked\nover and saw the rusty iron axe next to\nRyan. The blood stains on the axe head\nnot even completely dried. It really was\nit. Fongu took a closer look at Ryan and\nfound that the muscles on its skeleton\nwere becoming more and more muscular.\nFrom a distance, it no longer looked\nlike a skeleton, but rather like a dried\nup corpse. Um, did it evolve quietly on\nits own? Fong Yu suddenly understood\nwhen he thought of the 20 odd wild boar\ncarcasses outside the door. It must be\nthat Ryan went out and killed these wild\nboores in the middle of the night and\nthen leveled up by absorbing the energy\nfrom them. That must be it. No wonder it\ndidn't cut down trees, but hunted wild\nboores instead. Thinking of this, Funu\ncouldn't help but feel a little moved.\nHe felt that it must be because\nValentina said last night that she could\nonly go to York City after Ryan could\nmove during the day. So, the skeleton\nRyan wanted to evolve quickly and went\nto hunt wild boores alone at night. At\nthat moment, Alpha the dog ran to a wild\nboar carcass, shook its head, and\nscratched at it with its paws. Upon\ncloser inspection, Fong Yu noticed that\nthere were very obvious claw marks on\nthe wild boar's body. Of course, the\nfatal wounds were all huge gashes in the\nneck, and the fatal blow was probably\nfrom Ryan with an ax. Did you go hunting\nwild boar with Ryan last night? Funu\nasked. Alpha nodded. Fongu bent down and\npatted the dog's head, saying, \"I know\nyou're helping me and also helping\nyourselves evolve, but you must be\ncareful to ensure your safety.\nUnderstand?\" Woof! The dog barked. Fun\nYu then began collecting the carcasses\nof the 20 odd wild boores. During the\nthree-day winter challenge, most players\nhad spent most of their time indoors to\nward off the cold, and their food\nsupplies were probably nearly exhausted,\nso the pork should fetch a good price.\nThis time, Fongu specifically used the\nbutcher's technique to see its specific\neffects. After activating the butcher's\ntechnique, Fong Yu suddenly had a\npicture of a wild boar's body structure\nin his mind. He thought about where to\ninsert his knife to avoid the bones and\nwhere to cut along the bone seems to\nsever the tendons among other things.\nWhen he came to his senses, the wild\nboar carcass in front of him had already\nbeen dismembered and then turned into\nspecks of starlight that entered his\nbackpack. Holy crap, that's it. Fa was\ncompletely dumbfounded. Rewards: 30 wild\nboar meat, one pig heart, one pig liver\nfor pig trotters, two pig fat, three\nwild boar skin, eight pig bones.\nButchering skill proficiency 61 out of\n100. After 100 uses, it can be upgraded\nto intermediate butchering skill. Fongu\nraised an eyebrow slightly when he saw\nthe system notification. Originally, a\njuvenile wild boar could only yield 20\npieces of meat and two pieces of pigkin.\nNow the yield had increased by 50%. And\nthere were also two extra awful for pig\ntrotters and two pieces of pork fat\nroughly calculated. Using the butcher's\ntechnique almost doubled his profits.\nMoreover, this skill of butchering can\nbe upgraded. Luckily, Lu X Yao Fang is\nafraid of blood and can't use this\nskill. And luckily, I like to scour the\nexchange. So, he just happened to pick\nup this great deal. Funu even began to\nlook forward to it. How much more\nbenefit could the intermediate level of\nthe butcher's technique bring him?\nThinking of this, Fongu grinned. But\nwait, is the art of butchering strictly\nspeaking a kind of professional skill?\nAs if it had heard the question in Fong\nYu&lt;unk&gt;s mind, the game assistance\nprompt slowly appeared. The butcher's\nskill is a prerequisite skill for the\nbutcher class. Players can unlock the\nbutcher class when they upgrade the\nbutcher skill to intermediate level.\nButcher. Players who change their class\nto butcher will gain two points to their\nstrength attribute. Unlock the class\nexclusive weapon bone crusher and will\ncarry killing intent which has a certain\ndeterrent effect on lower level\ncreatures. When killing intent\naccumulates to a certain value, the\nbutcher's advanced class can be\nunlocked. Fongu wiped his face hard,\nlooked down at the cleaver he used to\nperform the butcher's technique, and\nsmiled helplessly. It's quite comical\nthat I, a writer who enjoys writing\nonline, would unintentionally become a\nbutcher. Compared to mages, greats sword\nmasters, alchemists, and the like, this\nbutcher was rather unworthy of respect.\nSo, Fong Yu was somewhat resistant to\nhim. Imagine that one day Fong Yu\nencounters other players. Player A\nholding a staff claims to be a mage.\nPlayer B carrying a great sword claims\nto be a great sword master. Player C.\nBut when it was Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s turn, all\nhe could do was pull out a butcher's\nknife and say, \"I'm a butcher.\" The\nscene was absolutely beautiful. I can't\nthink about it anymore. Just as Fong Yu\nwas at a loss for words, the game\nassistance notification appeared again.\nIn this game, players can wield multiple\nprofessions. Aside from professions with\nopposite attributes being incompatible,\ntheoretically, players can learn an\nunlimited number of professions if they\nwish. Seeing the newly popped up\nnotification, Fongu felt much better. It\nmeant that even if he unlocked the\nbutcher class, it wouldn't affect his\nability to learn other classes later.\nSince that's the case, then let's learn\nit. As the saying goes, when you're out\nin the world, it's always good to have a\nvariety of skills. After all, you can\nget two points of strength for free\nafter unlocking the butcher class. Isn't\nthe freebie appealing? So, Fong Yu began\nhumming a little tune as he used his\nbutchering skills to dissect the dozen\nor so wild boar carcasses in front of\nhim. If there's any drawback to the\nbutcher's technique, it's that it's\nquite time-conuming. Once Fong Yu uses\nthe butcher's technique, his body will\nautomatically pick up the cleaver and\nstart dissecting the wild boar's\ncarcass. Although the whole process is\nsmooth and without any unnecessary\nmovements, it still takes him 2 minutes\nto dissect a single wild boar. Another\nproblem is that he discovered that using\nthe butcher's technique to dissect a\nwild boar consumes five stamina points\nand one spirit point. The spirit point\ndoesn't matter, but the stamina points\nare consumed too quickly. Half an hour\nlater, after he had finished butchering\nthe 10th wild boar, his stamina dropped\nto 23, and he clearly felt tired. \"I\ncan't take it anymore,\" Funu said to\nAlpha as he put away his machete and sat\ndown on the ground. \"This skill is too\ntiring. I need to rest for a while, go\nback and have some water and something\nto eat. In reality, he knew that if this\nwere the case, let alone breaking down\n10 pigs in half an hour, he would\nstruggle to even break down one pig in\nhalf an hour. In comparison, the\nbutcher's skills in the game can be\ndescribed as divine, comparable to the\ntartar chef in the movie Dragon. man.\nThinking of that tarter chef, Fongu\nnaturally thought of the scene at the\nvery end of the movie where the tartar\nused his skillful knife work to shave\noff the flesh and blood from the final\nboss's leg in the blink of an eye.\nThinking of this, Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s eyes lit\nup. Exactly. He could easily memorize\nthe feeling of making a cut while\npracticing the art of butchering and\nthen integrate those feelings into a\nunique sword technique. For example,\nwhen fighting wild boores now, Fong Yu\nalready knows very well which part of\nthe wild boar's body is the weakest,\nwhich part can be killed with a single\nblow, and which part can be rendered\nincapacitated with a light cut. In this\nrespect, the art of butchering is very\nhelpful in combat. As long as you have\ndissected a creature using the art of\nbutchering, you will know its\nweaknesses. Haha, I never imagined that\nthe butcher's technique would have so\nmany wonderful uses. I've really struck\ngold this time. Chapter 53. The Allure\nof Trade. Although the butcher's skill\ncan increase profits, it is also a\nphysically demanding skill. In the end,\neven with this convenient skill, there\nis still a price to pay. So, Fu returned\nto the cabin, ate some berries, and\nrested on the bed for a while. Once he\nhad recovered his strength, he continued\nto use his butchering skills to dissect\nthe wild boar. If it weren't for the\nextra 50% profit and proficiency, he\nwould have been tempted to take the easy\nway out and just use the systems\ndecomposition method. After all, the\nbloody and mangled scene when using the\nbutcher's technique to dissect a corpse\nwas quite nauseating, especially the\nstench of blood, which almost made Fongu\nvomit. Being a butcher is no job for\njust anyone, Fongu remarked. After doing\nthis job for a long time, even meat\ndoesn't taste as good anymore. Finally,\nanother half hour passed and Fong Yu\nfinished butchering all 15 wild boores,\nharvesting a total of 450 pieces of wild\nboar meat and some awful trotters and\nlard. Satisfied, he returned to the\ncabin. The first thing I did upon\nreturning to the cabin was to rush into\nthe bathroom and take a shower to wash\naway the smell of blood, otherwise I\nwouldn't be able to eat. However, with\nthe addition of new ingredients, Fong Yu\nbecame interested and said to Alpha,\n\"Let's have roasted pigs trotters for\nlunch with some cumin and chili powder.\nIt tastes amazing.\" Woof! At noon, Fong\nYu and Alpha ate a total of five cumin\nroasted pigs trotters. Funu ate two, and\nthe dog, who was eating spiced roasted\npigs trotters for the first time,\nactually ate three in one go. After a\nsatisfying meal, the man and his dog\nenjoyed a comfortable afternoon nap.\nThis is what life is all about, Fong Yu\nexclaimed, lying on the bed and rubbing\nhis stomach. Once we upgrade to a manor\nand have farmland and plant more fruits\nand vegetables, life will be so\ncomfortable. Fongu woke up at 2:00 p.m.\nand having nothing to do, decided to go\nout for a stroll again. As for where to\ngo, Fong Yu had made up his mind. He\nwould naturally go to the place with the\nhighest return on investment, the\nunderground world. In fact, besides\nbutchering the wild boars, he spent the\nrest of the morning roasting meat in the\ncabin. He roasted 100 portions of the\n450 pieces of wild boar meat he had just\nobtained, intending to take them to the\nunderworld to exchange for good things\nwith the rat king. 100 portions of\nbarbecue. It took him more than two\nhours to grill until his hands were numb\nand his face was blackened by the smoke.\nBut after all, he had already made a\ndeal with the rat king. Two pieces of\nmeat could be exchanged for one\nelemental crystal. A piece of cumin\nroasted meat is worth 20 points. Two\npieces are worth 40 points, but can be\nexchanged for elemental crystals worth\n500 points. This deal yields a 12.5fold\nprofit. Only a fool wouldn't do that.\nThis reminded Fong Yu of the Arabs who\ntraveled thousands of miles to China to\nsell spices in ancient times. They\nbrought spices that were cheap and\ncommon in Persia to the Tang Dynasty and\nsold them for prices comparable to gold.\nThe profits were estimated to be\nhundreds of times higher. This is the\nallure of trade. So after gathering all\nthe usable equipment, Funyu took the dog\nand ran towards the mine. By this time,\nall the winter snow had melted, and the\nspring forest was full of life. The once\nwithered leaves and bushes had come back\nto life, and the sounds of insects and\nbirds could be heard everywhere in the\nforest. Small animals such as feeasants\nand rabbits could also be seen\neverywhere. Walking in the forest, Fongu\nfelt a sense of returning to nature.\nWhile on their journey, Fongu also\nstopped Alpha from hunting feeasants.\nThere were still several hundred pieces\nof various meats in the warehouse, and\nthey would expire and rot if they were\nnot eaten soon. So, Fong Yu did not want\nAlpha to waste time. Upon arriving at\nthe mine, Fong Yu, as expected, did not\nsee the ghost miners. So, he easily\nfollowed the mine tunnel down into the\npit and ran towards the entrance to the\nunderground world. Along the way, Fun Yu\nencountered miners who were mining.\nAfter exchanging a few pleasantries, he\ncontinued towards the underground world\nwith his dog, but ghost Steve and Ghost\nIvanov insisted on going down with him.\nThe underground world is still very\ndangerous. Let us go down with you.\nFongu found it hard to refuse the two\nghosts kindness. So, he and his dog\nalong with the two ghosts followed the\ncrater created by the explosion to the\nedge of the underground rift and then\nwent down the slope to the bottom of the\nrift. To be honest, every time Fongu\ndescended this rift valley, it was an\nordeal and a challenge because the slope\nhad no handrails and was very steep. If\nit weren't for Alpha and the two ghosts,\nreminding him, Fongu probably would have\nslipped and fallen. After finally\nreaching the bottom of the valley, Funu\nfelt his legs go weak. So, he discussed\nit with Steve and asked him to help\ncarve out some steps for the way down.\nAfter all, he'll probably be using this\nroad a lot in the future, so it needs\nsome minor repairs to reduce safety\nhazards. Steve and Ivonov readily agreed\nand immediately began repairing the path\nacross the rift with pickaxes. While\nFongu prepared to take Alpha to the\ncave, where the golden rat king was\nlocated. When Fong Yu and Alpha arrived\nat the cave leading to the rat king's\ncave, they saw that there were huge rock\nrats moving around everywhere in the\nshadows. Moreover, the rock rats had\nsome shiny minerals in their mouths or\npaws. It looks like they're all carrying\nthese ores towards the rat king's\nburrow. Upon seeing this, Fongu raised\nan eyebrow and smiled slightly. It seems\nthat the rat king really did mobilize\nthe entire rat horde to help him find\nminerals that could be used to exchange\nfor roasted meat. So, Fong Yu along with\nthe dog and two ghosts swaggered into\nthe rat king's cave. Along the way, the\ngiant rock rats all avoided Alpha when\nthey saw him. When Fong Yu entered the\ncave where the rat king was, he saw that\na small mountain made of various\nminerals had been piled up again in the\ncenter of the cave, which had been empty\nbefore. However, judging from the\nquantity, it is much less than what I\nsaw last time, only about 1/3. But it's\nunderstandable. The previous mountain of\nor was something the rat king had been\nsaving for who knows how long. While\nthis mountain of or was only found by\nthe rat king mobilizing the rat horde in\njust one day. Finding so much is already\nquite impressive. At this moment, the\ngolden rat king was lying on the top of\nthe hill, sleeping with his head on a\npiece of roasted meat, drooling as he\nslept. Hey, time to wake up. Fongu\npicked up a pebble and threw it at the\nrat king. The golden rat king was\nslightly startled. Its plump body jolted\nawake. When its beady eyes saw that it\nwas Fong Yu, it immediately scrambled\ndown from the small hill of Ore. It\nstretched out its short forlims and\npointed to the hill behind it, squeaking\nas it did so. \"Are you going to switch\nto barbecue?\" Funu asked. Upon hearing\nthis, the rat king&lt;unk&gt;s small eyes\nwidened instantly, and he nodded\nvigorously. \"Okay, I'll go pick up the\ngoods first.\" After saying that, Fongu\nwent to the small mountain of minerals\nand began collecting them. Chapter 54.\nAlthough I'm not human, you really are a\ndog. Received six fire crystals for\ncrystal stones, five earth crystals,\nfive wood crystals, three gold crystals,\n25 silver ore, 16 gold ore, 75 iron ore,\ntwo myithil ore. As expected, the\nquantity of supplies was less than a\nthird of what it was last time, and\nthere was a lot more iron ore to make up\nthe difference. But Fongu was still\nquite satisfied. After all, whether you\nearn a lot or a little, it's still\nearning money. As a person, you can't be\ngreedy. There's an old saying that goes,\n\"Buying and selling, that's how you\nbuild a lasting business. Welcoming and\nseeing off guests, that's how you win\nthe hearts of thousands. Only by\nestablishing a trusting and stable\ncooperative relationship can this\nmutually beneficial business approach\nlast.\" After calculating for a moment,\nFong Yu simply took out all 100 portions\nof roasted meat from his bag, piled them\nin the center of the cave, and said to\nthe rat king, \"According to our\nagreement, there should be a total of 91\nportions of roasted meat. Iron or was\nnot included in our last transaction, so\nI'll just exchange it with you at a\nratio of 10 iron or to one portion of\nroasted meat. Here are 100 portions of\nroasted meat. The extra one is on me.\"\nThe rat king had already pounced on the\n100 portions of roasted meat, rolling\naround happily and squeaking\nincessantly, completely forgetting about\nsettling accounts with Fongu. Fongu\nchuckled, annoyed. Luckily, he was\nhonest enough. Otherwise, the rat king\nwould probably have been ripped off. At\nthis moment, several giant rock rats\nfrom the nearby swarm tried to approach\nthe roasted meat in the center of the\ncave. Upon noticing this, the weary rat\nking immediately bared its teeth and\nclaws and howled at the approaching rock\nrats. Seeing this, the rock rats could\nonly cower and retreat. Seeing this,\nFong Yu shook his head slightly and said\nto the golden-haired rat king, \"You\ncan't do it this way.\" The golden rat\nking was stunned, not understanding what\nFongu meant. Fongu pointed to the rock\nrats hiding in the corner and said,\n\"Although you are their king and can\nenjoy some privileges, you cannot\ndeprive them of their due rights. I saw\non my way here that all the supplies I\nexchanged were painstakingly collected\nby them from the underground world.\nTherefore, they should have a share of\nthis roasted meat.\" Upon hearing this,\nthe golden rat king's eyes widened, and\nit began to squeak and squeak while once\nagain bearing its teeth and claws at the\nrock rats around it. Upon seeing this,\nthe surrounding rock rats all hid in the\nshadows. Seeing this, Funyu shook his\nhead helplessly. He tried to fight for\nsome of the benefits that the ordinary\nrock rats deserved. But the ordinary\nrock rats seemed to have become\naccustomed to submitting to the tyranny\nof the rat king and were unwilling to\nresist. As lower animals, they lacked\nthe complex thoughts and emotions of\nhumans. Even this seemingly intelligent\nrat king could not possibly understand\nthe principle that water can carry a\nboat, but it can also capsize it. Since\nthat's the case, let's just leave it to\nthem. Although he thought this to\nhimself, Fong Yu still said to the rat\nking in the end, \"If you want our deal\nto continue, then at least half of the\nroasted meat I give you in the future\nshould be given to your people.\" This\ntime, Fong Yu shifted the point of\nconflict from the rat king and the rat\npack to the rat king and himself. The\nrat king could be aggressive towards his\nown rat pack, but he wouldn't dare to be\naggressive towards Fongu. Although\nextremely unwilling, he finally nodded\nand agreed to Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s request. So,\nat the rat king's signal, the\nsurrounding rats quickly dragged away\nhalf of the roasted meat and began to\ngnaw on it. Seeing this, the rat king\nwas so anxious that he kept pacing\naround. Fong Yu snapped at the rat king.\nWhat's your hurry? Even if you only get\nhalf, you still have 50 pieces of\nroasted meat. You might not be able to\nfinish those 50 pieces in 3 days, and\nthey'll all rot. However, although the\nrat king understood Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s\nmeaning, he still watched the other rock\nrats munching on roasted meat\nlistlessly, feeling extremely\nheartbroken. Fong Yu knew that this was\na typical Miser's personality. Even if\nhe couldn't use it or eat it himself, he\nwas unwilling to share it with others.\nIf the other party were a person, he\nmight have said a few more words. But\nsince the other party was just a rat, he\nwas too lazy to waste any more words.\nAfter finishing up, Fongu left a\nmessage. See, I kept my word and we\ncompleted our deal. I'll bring more\nbarbecue in 3 days and maybe some other\ngood stuff, too. We'll see how much good\nstuff you can get in these three days.\nAfter saying that, Fong Yu left with the\ndog and the ghosts. After Fong Yu left\nwhile munching on delicious roasted\nmeat, the rat king pondered how to\nobtain more ores and crystals to\nexchange for even more roasted meat from\nthat human. It quickly thought of a\nplace where many good things were\nhidden, including the colorful stone\nthat the human wanted. But there was\nalso something there that terrified it.\nJust thinking about that terrifying\nbeing made the rat king shudder. And\neven the roasted meat in his mouth lost\nits appeal. So the rat king simply\nstopped thinking about it and focused on\ngnawing on the roasted meat in front of\nhim. Anyway, there was still plenty of\nroasted meat left so he could worry\nabout it after he finished eating. After\nleaving the underground world, Fun Yu\nexplained to Steve that Yorktown had\nbeen occupied by a group of orcs and\nthat he might not be able to go there\nfor the time being. Those orcs, I can't\nbelieve those lowly creatures dared to\noccupy our town. Steve gritted his teeth\nand said angrily, \"They're absolutely\ndespicable.\"\nFongu originally planned to ask Steve\nsome information about this world, but\nthen he thought that they had been dead\nfor so many years, so it would be\npointless to ask. So, he decided to wait\nuntil Valentina came out that evening\nand ask her for information about this\nworld. As the saying goes, know yourself\nand know your enemy and you will never\nbe defeated. Whether you are living a\npeaceful rural life in a cabin in the\nwoods or going out to explore, this\ninformation is very important. After\nsaying goodbye to the ghosts, Fongu led\nAlpha back to the cabin. By this time,\nthe snow in the forest had melted and\nbeams of light were scattering into the\nforest. Unidentified bird song and\ninsect chirps could be heard in the\nforest again. Even many small animals\nhave started to come out to forage for\nfood. Fong Yu also saw a large feeasant\nleading a dozen or so chicks darting\nthrough the bushes, seemingly searching\nfor food. Alpha originally wanted to\nrush over and catch the big feeasant,\nbut Fong Yu stopped him. The dog looked\nat Fong Yu with a puzzled expression.\nFong Yu explained, \"Didn't you see that\nit's out looking for food with its\nbabies? If you catch the big ones now,\nthe little ones will have a hard time\nsurviving. It's not worth it. You should\nwait until the babies are a bit bigger\nbefore catching them. That way, you can\ncatch a whole litter at once. Upon\nhearing this, Alpha widened its dog eyes\nand looked at Fong Yu, thinking to\nitself, \"Although I am not human, you\nare a real dog.\" Chapter 55. The wooden\nhouse gets upgraded twice. The manor is\nright in front of us. With this\nincident, Fong Yu also paid special\nattention to the changes in the forest.\nHe found that all the plants were\ngrowing rapidly at a visible rate. The\nsaplings sprouted in just 10 minutes and\nthe wild flowers turned from buds into\nblooming flowers in just 5 minutes.\nConsidering that the four seasons change\nin 12 days in this world, which is 30\ntimes faster than a year on Earth, 365\ndays, Fong, you guessed that the growth\nrate of plants must have been\naccelerated by 30 times. This is\nactually very good news, which means\nthat if you grow your own crops, the\nharvest speed will be extremely fast.\nSo, Fong Yu immediately decided to go\nback and upgrade the cabin into a manor,\nopen up farmland, and plant the crop\nseeds he had collected from the exchange\nduring the spring. However, it remains\nto be seen whether this 30-fold increase\nin time will have any effect on people.\nFunu touched the stubble that had grown\non his chin and felt a little panicked.\nIf this 30x speed applied to him,\nwouldn't he die of old age very quickly?\nFortunately, the game assistant provided\na hint. It's not that time flows 30\ntimes faster. It just accelerates the\ngrowth cycle of plants and some lower\nanimals. Higher life forms and players\nin this world are unaffected. Phew,\nthat's good. Funu breathed a sigh of\nrelief, but then he realized what was\ngoing on. If that's the case, then this\nplace must be paradise. As long as we\nestablish a manor, have farmland, and\nraise some animals, we can be more than\nself-sufficient. Huh? Whether it's\nheaven or hell depends on how\ncivilization develops. What's the\nmeaning? When people are hungry, they\nonly think about how to fill their\nstomachs. But after they've eaten their\nfill, they have many more things to do.\nThe game assistant's words woke Fong Yu\nup. 90% of the messed up things in the\nworld are done by people who have\nnothing better to do. But Fong Yu is\ndifferent. He wasn't interested in those\npower games of vying for fame and\nfortune. He was content with being able\nto eat and drink his fill and live a\ncomfortable life. So after returning to\nthe cabin, Fongu put away the 10 large\nanimal traps around it and then\nimmediately opened the house upgrade\ninterface. The materials were already\nprepared and winter was over. It was\ntime to upgrade the cabin. So Fongu\nclicked on the upgrade button. After a\nfamiliar shaking, Fongu saw a new door\nframe on the east wall of the living\nroom. He could hear the sound of wooden\nplanks being built inside the door\nframe, indicating that a new room had\nbeen added. In addition, clanging sounds\ncame from the various joints of the\nwooden house as iron ingots were broken\ndown into nails and embedded into the\njoints of the wooden planks, further\nreinforcing the house. The sudden\nshaking of the wooden house startled the\nlittle spider cherry blossom on the roof\nbeam, who pulled a thread and swung it\ndown, landing precisely on Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s\nhead and hiding in his hair. One minute\nlater, everything settled down, and the\ncabin had gained an extra room,\ntransforming from a one-bedroom\napartment into a two-bedroom apartment.\nFunu walked into the newly built room\nand took a look. It was about 15 square\nmeters, about the same size as his own\nbedroom with a wooden bed, a bedside\ntable, and a wooden wardrobe. Ghost\nValentina's trust level plus 20,\nSkeleton Ryan's trust level plus 30,\nCorpse Dog Alpha's trust level plus 40.\nCurrently, Valentina's trust level is\n120, Skeleton Lion's trust level is 158,\nand Corpse Dog Alpha's trust level is\n220. The game assistants prompt appeared\nat the opportune moment. When your\ncompanion's affection level reaches 500,\nthey will tell you some of their\nsecrets. Secret? Fongu glanced at Alfa\nat his feet, then looked at Ryan lying\nin the living room and stroked his chin\nas he pondered. After the game assistant\nreminded him, Fong Yu also began to\nrealize that the backgrounds of his\nthree companions were not as simple as\nhe had imagined. They all seem to be at\na low point in their strength right now,\nbut their combat power is already very\nstrong. So, when they slowly recover\ntheir strength, won't they be even\nstronger? To obtain more information,\nthe only option at present seems to be\nto continue increasing our affinity with\nthem. However, Fongu wasn't concerned\nabout that right now. What he really\nwanted was to continue upgrading the\nhouse, upgrade the wooden cabin to a\nmanor, and then unlock the farmland. So,\nhe opened the wooden cabin upgrade\ninterface again and took a look. He\nremembered that he had enough materials\nto upgrade it one more time. I was just\nwondering who should use the room first,\nbut now it's all good. Ryan and\nValentina each have a room. So, Fongu\nclicked upgrade again. After another\nround of shaking and clanging, another\ndoor frame appeared on the east wall of\nthe living room, and the wooden house\ngained another room. Three bedrooms and\none living room. Not only did Fong Yu\nshow a relieved smile, but even Alpha\nshowed a silly grin. But what are you\nlaughing at? I didn't prepare a room for\nyou. Ghost Valentina's trust level plus\n20. Skeleton Ryan's trust level plus 30.\nCorpse dog Alpha's trust level plus 40.\n140, Skeleton Lion's trust level is 188,\n260. Finally, Ryan doesn't have to sleep\nin the living room anymore. And\nValentina doesn't have to wander around\non the roof everyday. Fongu sighed. Then\nhe looked at the dog and said, \"But I'm\nsorry to trouble you. There's no room\nfor you right now. Why don't you sleep\nwith me?\" The dog glanced at Fong Yu,\nshook its head, crawled into its bed,\nrolled around, and seemed to indicate\nthat its little bed was very comfortable\nto sleep in. \"Huh, this dog is\nsensible.\" Funu then looked at the house\nupgrade interface again. If he\nremembered correctly, the next level\nwould allow the wooden house to be\nupgraded into a manor. Spacious forest\nhaunted house, three star, three\nbedrooms, one living room, one kitchen,\none bathroom, 80sqm. Haunted manor, one\nstar, three bedrooms, one living room,\none kitchen, one bathroom, one yard, 90s\nsqm indoors, 100sqm yard. Upgrade\nrequirements: wood 1510/2000\ngravel 5090/1000\nmud 600500\nvines 410500\niron ingots 816/200\nbones 386/500\ncannot be upgraded. All conditions are\nmet except for a few bones. As the manor\nbecomes available, fences, farmland,\nponds, and warehouses will be upgraded\nto sellers, increasing storage capacity\nfrom 30 to 60. Sure enough, the farmland\nwas right in front of them. Fongu rubbed\nhis hands together excitedly. Chapter\n56. A big forest has all kinds of birds.\nFongu had planned this for a long time\nto take advantage of the arrival of\nspring and quickly upgrade the wooden\nhouse into a manor and then develop\nfarmland to grow crops. To be honest, he\nhad been craving a bowl of white rice,\nnoodles, and steamed buns for a long\ntime. Although the manor was almost\nwithin reach, they were still short of\nbones for the upgrade materials. These\nbones were really worthless. One piece\nof wood could be exchanged for two or\nthree bones. Funu opened the exchange\nand bought all the bones he needed.\nIncidentally, he also glanced at the\nprices on the exchange. He had played\nmany games before, but no matter what\ngame it was, his favorite thing to do\nwas to camp out on the exchange and make\na fortune by buying low and selling\nhigh. His previous strategy of buying\nred mushrooms at low prices, then\nreleasing information that red mushrooms\ncould deal with wild boars and then\nreselling them at high prices was based\non his accumulated experience. Don't\nunderestimate this tactic. On Earth, the\nwealthiest people mostly accumulate\ntheir wealth through this kind of\nmaneuver. Now that spring has arrived,\nit's time to harvest chives again. His\noriginal plan was to have other players\nuse red mushrooms to hunt wild boores,\nand then he would buy the boar hides at\na low price, make them into wild boar\narmor sets, and sell them at a high\nprice. With winter over, most players\nwere eager to go out and gather\nresources or explore. After the morning\nannouncement, players could make their\nown mining tools and some simple\nweapons, but not everyone could make a\ncomplete set of armor. Moreover, the\nwild boar armor is of excellent green\nquality, which greatly improves\nsurvivability. The set bonus also allows\nyou to blend into a wild boar herd\nwithout actively attacking them. If you\nadd red umbrella mushrooms, it's\npractically an essential tool for\nslaughtering pigs. Several days have\npassed now and there should be quite a\nfew wild boar hides in the exchange by\nnow. So Fongu immediately opened the\nexchange and bought all the lowpriced\nwild boar hides in the exchange. A total\nof 1,678\nhides at an average price of about three\nwood per hide, spending a little over\n5,000 wood in total. After preparing the\npig skin, Fongu went to the crafting\ntable and began mass-roducing wild boar\narmor. A complete wild boar set requires\nseven wild boar hides. 1678 wild boar\nhides can make 239 sets. However, there\nseems to be not enough linen. So, Fong\nYu bought another batch of linen from\nthe exchange. Once all the materials\nwere ready, Fong Yu simply waved his\nhand and ordered everything to be made.\nBut when the crafting table started\nmaking the set, Fongu was dumbfounded.\nIt took 10 minutes to make one set of\nwild boar armor. And it would take 2,390\nminutes or 40 hours to make all 239\nsets. Then we'll have to wait until the\nday after tomorrow. My time is very\nprecious. So, you canled the production\nand made two new production tables,\ndistributing the materials evenly across\nthe three tables. Even so, it would\nstill take more than 13 hours to\ncomplete the entire production. Each\nplayer has a maximum of three crafting\nstations, so there's nothing you can do\nbut wait. Then he noticed that the price\nof iron ore in the exchange seemed to\nhave started to rise from one iron or to\nfive would a couple of days ago to one\niron or to 15 wood. The price has\ntripled. This means that the price of\nthe 956 iron ingots in Fangien has also\ntripled, equivalent to nearly 15,000\nyuan worth of timber. So, Fong Yu\ncasually listed 700 iron ingots. After\nlisting the goods, he went to the chat\nchannel to advertise them in order to\nsell them quickly. Fong Yu ID006\nclearance sale. Just listed 700 iron\ningots. Those who need to upgrade\ngathering tools, weapons, and houses,\nhurry and grab your iron ingots. First\ncome, first served. These words caused a\nhuge stir, and the chat channel became\nincredibly popular once again. Wu Jingia\nID757. Holy crap. Just who is this Fong\nYu? How does he always manage to get so\nmany supplies? Leong Yuchi ID 331. Oh my\ngod. 700 iron ingots. You must have\nbrought the entire mine home, right?\nDong Hao ID 3356.\nAwesome. I'm so impressed by Fong Yu. Wu\nJian ID 2296.\nI estimate that Fong Yu must have the\nmost resources in our area and he's\nprobably the Lord. Lynn Shaon ID 1573\nCould you sell it for a lower price? You\nhave so many supplies. You must have\nplenty of money. Please help us newbies.\nLu Hashue ID 9123. Exactly. It's too\nexpensive. I can't afford it. Please,\nsomeone lower the price. Wu Fong Lang ID\n4516. Fong you ID006.\nBro, where did you get so many iron\ningots? Share them with me. LVG Pang ID\n575. Yeah, share it quickly. Wong Fong\nID 2516. To be honest, why should Fong\nYu? A big shot. Lower the price for you\nguys. If you can't afford it, then don't\nbuy it. Yao Jiwin ID 357. Exactly. This\nis a survival game. Helping you is a\nfavor. Not helping you is our right.\nLynn Shaon ID573.\nDid I even talk to you? What's it to\nyou? Stop nagging. Wong Fong ID2516.\nI just can't stand guys like you who\nalways try to take advantage of others.\nFong you sighed helplessly and closed\nthe chat channel. He had gotten used to\nthe noise and chatter in the chat\nchannel these past few days. A large\nforest has all kinds of birds, let alone\na complex animal like humans. Having\nacquired so many supplies will\ninevitably arouse jealousy and attract\nthose who want to take advantage of the\nsituation. These days, his friend\nrequest list is constantly filled with\npeople adding him as a friend for\nvarious reasons and some even want to\nfind out his location. Among them was a\ngroup of players calling themselves the\nDong Shung Gang who were searching\neverywhere for Fong Yu's location. In\nfact, the leader of the Dong Shen gang,\nSidu Haan, even offered a reward of 10\npieces of meat in the chat channel to\nfind Fong Yu. Upon seeing this, Fong Yu\nwas slightly angered. Am I only worth 10\npieces of meat? Who do you think you\nare? As for why he wanted to find Fong\nYu&lt;unk&gt;s whereabouts, anyone with a\nbrain knows they're up to no good. Nine\ntimes out of 10, they're trying to rob\nFong Yu of his supplies, and they might\neven kill him to cover it up. Some\nplayers speculate that Sidu Haan wants\nto become the lord because he feels that\nFong Yu is his biggest rival. So he\nwants to find Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s location and\nthen kill him. After all, this is a\nworld without laws and those lawless\nscoundrels are capable of anything. Of\ncourse, Fong Yu wasn't too worried about\nthis. He had three companions to protect\nhim. So, as long as he stayed inside the\nhouse, there wouldn't be any major\nproblems. As for going out to explore,\nhe just needed to be careful. Even if he\nencountered other players, no one would\nknow who was who, so it wouldn't be a\nbig deal. Sigh. Let's not think about\nthat too much for now. Let's upgrade the\nhouse into a manor first. Chapter 57.\nSmall goal achieved. Spacious forest\nhaunted house. Three star. Three\none bathroom, 80sqm. Haunted manor. One\nstar. Three bedrooms. One living room.\nOne kitchen, one bathroom, one yard.\n90sqm indoor area 100sqm yard. Upgrade\nrequirements: wood 8930/2000\nmud 800500\nvines 910500\niron ingots 256/200\nbones 586/500\nupgradeable few. Finally I've collected\nthem all. Fong Yu breathed a sigh of\nrelief and immediately clicked to\nupgrade. As the cabin was being upgraded\namidst noise and vibration, Alpha came\nto Fong Yu's side and together they\nexamined the changes to the cabin. After\nbeing upgraded to a manor, the living\nroom of the log cabin was expanded\nagain. The originally rough wooden walls\nwere even polished. Upon closer\ninspection, it was found that not only\nthe walls, but also the tables, chairs,\nand even the floor were polished.\nLooking up, the roof was also covered\nwith a ceiling, and an iron chandelier\nappeared in the center of the living\nroom ceiling with a dark gothic style in\nits design. In addition, a ring of\ncarved iron railings was added around\nthe fireplace, and several carved iron\nlines were added to the gate. At first\nglance, the overall quality immediately\ngoes up. Manner upgrade complete. Ghost\nValentina's trust level plus 20.\nSkeleton Ryan's trust level plus 30.\n180, Skeleton Lion's trust level is 248,\n300. To celebrate the successful\nachievement of the manor's small goal in\nadvance, Fong Yu stir-fried a dish of\nfragrant and pungent braised pork\nintestines with scallions to reward\nhimself, an alpha. With the help of the\nbutcher's technique, Fu was able to\nobtain more ingredients from his prey,\nthus enriching his diet. This is largely\nthanks to his years of staying at home\nwriting. He has developed excellent\ncooking skills in his spare time, as he\nrarely leaves the house. Otherwise, even\nif he had these ingredients, he wouldn't\nhave been able to cook them. It was\nalready dark when Valentina slowly\nfloated down from the roof beam. Seeing\nFong Yu cooking, she curiously went over\nto take a look. Master, can this be\neaten? Valentino watched Fong Yu process\nthe string of white and gritty pig\nintestines, her expression somewhat\nunpleasant. She had never heard of\nanyone eating pig awful, especially\norgans specifically designed to hold\nfeces. He Funu chuckled and said, \"You\ndon't understand, do you? In my\nhometown, thrift is a virtue. In order\nto save food, people have researched and\nturned anything edible into delicious\ndishes. This large intestine is one of\nthem. As he spoke, Fa used a kitchen\nknife to cut open the intestines and\ncarefully clean them, saying, \"The key\nto making this large intestine tastes\ngood is to remove 70% of the fat inside\nand keep 30%. Removing 70% of the fat\nmakes it less greasy, while keeping 30%\nbrings out the unique aroma of the large\nintestine.\" Valentina nodded as if she\nunderstood, but judging from her\nexpression, she was still very resistant\nto making pork intestines into a dish.\nThen comes the order of cooking. Heat\nthe pan with oil. Stir fry the\nscallions, ginger, and garlic together\nand remove them all when they turn a\ndull yellow color. Then add honey. And\nonce the honey has melted, add the large\nintestine and stir fry for 3 minutes.\nSee, like this. As Fong Yu operated the\nmachine, he explained, \"The key here is\nto add alcohol, preferably beer. Since\nwe have limited resources, let's just\npour some rum first.\" Finally, Fong Yu\nadded a little water and salt, muttering\nas he stir fried, \"It's a pity I didn't\nhave any light soy sauce. Otherwise, the\ntaste would be perfect.\" And you know\nwhat? After the brazed pork intestines\nwith scallions were cooked, Alfa\nespecially loved the taste of the\nintestines. Before it was even on the\ntable, Alfa couldn't wait to rush into\nthe kitchen, drooling all over the\nplace. In the end, it ate almost 2/3 of\nthe whole big bowl of pork intestines.\nThe little spider cherry blossom had\ngrown to the size of a grapefruit. It\nhad finally stopped eating only berries\nand started eating meat. However, it\nseemed very uninterested in large\nintestines. Fongu tried to feed it\nseveral times, but it avoided him. Ryan\nwas a diligent fellow. As soon as he\nwoke up, he carried his rusty iron ax\nout of his room, greeted Fong Yu, and\nthen went out, probably off hunting\nagain. \"It has to be said that when it\ncomes to diligence, Ryan is the best.\"\n\"By the way, Valentina, I have something\nimportant to ask you,\" Fongu said.\nValentina blinked her big eyes and\nsmiled. Please go ahead. I have three\nattribute points, but I don't know where\nto allocate them. Do you have any\nsuggestions? After Fong Yu finished\nspeaking, he noticed that Valentino was\nlooking at him curiously. Master, what\ndid you just say? I didn't hear you,\nValentina replied. Just as Fong Yu was\nwondering, a system notification\nsuddenly popped up. Warning, please do\nnot attempt to discuss game related\nmatters with any creatures in this\nworld. Failure to heed this warning will\nresult in penalties from the system.\nFongu suddenly realized that yes, the\ngame assistant had told him a long time\nago that he couldn't talk to the beings\nin this world about anything related to\nthe game or he would be blocked. So\nafter thinking for a moment, Funu could\nonly ask in a different way. I'm\nplanning to learn a skill or rather a\nprofession. I've heard that there are\nmany professions in this world like\nmagicians, swordsmen, alchemists, and so\non. Do you have any suggestions?\nValentina tilted her head and thought\nfor a moment before replying, \"It\ndepends on talent. Everyone has\ndifferent talents and therefore\ndifferent strengths.\" Fongu pointed to\nhimself and asked expectantly, \"Then can\nyou tell if I have any talent in any\narea?\"\nValentina gave Fong Yu a strange look,\nsaid nothing, then turned to look at\nAlpha while the dog actually raised a\npaw and covered its eyes. Holy crap,\nwhat does this mean? Can't bear to look.\nFinally, the game assistant seemed to\nhave had enough and sent a notification\nmessage. Mage job advancement\nrequirements, intelligence greater than\nor equal to 9, and basic elemental\naffinity. Swordsman job advancement\nrequirements. Strength greater than or\nequal to 8. Agility greater than or\nequal to 7. Alchemist job advancement\nrequirements. Intelligence greater than\nor equal to 9. And must learn the basics\nof enchanted reaction. I see. Fongu\nfinally understood why his two\ncompanions reacted this way. His\nattributes were all below standard. So\nin their eyes, he did not meet the basic\nrequirements of these professions.\nChapter 58. elemental crystals and\nelemental affinity. I thought changing\njobs would be easy, but now it seems the\nconditions are very demanding. However,\nlooking at it from another perspective,\nthese powerful professions are not\nsomething that ordinary people can\nswitch to. So, it's understandable that\nthe entry requirements are high. After\nall, if you're not intelligent enough,\nyou might not even be able to understand\na magic circle or remember a spell. At\nthis moment, the understanding Valentina\nnoticed that Fong Youu seemed to be in a\nbad mood. So, she comforted him. Master,\ndon't be discouraged. There will\ndefinitely be a profession that suits\nyou. Yes, there is indeed a job that\nsuits me. But that profession is really\nhard to talk about. A butcher wielding a\npigs slaughtering knife. Fong Yu smiled\nhelplessly, thought for a moment, and\nthen asked Valentina. Then, can you tell\nif I have any elemental affinity? He had\njust noticed the game assistance\nnotification that the requirement for a\nmage to change jobs is an intelligence\nlevel of 9 or higher. His current\nintelligence level was 7.53 and he had\nthree attribute points to allocate\nfreely. If he added two points to his\nintelligence, he would exceed nine\npoints. The rest depended on whether he\nhad elemental affinity. Valentina smiled\nslightly and said patiently, \"There are\ntwo ways to acquire elemental affinity.\nOne is innate and the other is\ncultivated. Your current conditions\nperfectly meet the requirements for\ncultivation. The implication is that he\nhimself has lost his affinity for\nelements. Then how should we train them?\nFunu asked curiously. Didn't you just\nbring back a batch of elemental\ncrystals? All you need to do is grind\nthe elemental crystals into powder and\nthen put 10 portions of the elemental\ncrystal powder into the bathtub for a\nbath. It's that simple. Fongu was\nsomewhat surprised. It sounds simple,\nbut it's actually quite difficult to\ncollect just 10 elemental crystals of\nthe same attribute. Fongu suddenly\nrealized that what they said made sense.\nHe had found these elemental crystals in\nthe rat king's lair in the underground\nworld. If it weren't for the protection\nof the ghosts and alpha, he wouldn't\nhave been able to explore the\nunderground world, let alone break into\nthe rat king's lair. From this\nperspective, obtaining elemental\ncrystals is indeed extremely difficult,\nwhich also means that changing one's\nclass to become a mage is extremely\ndifficult. Each elemental crystal is\nprecious. In terms of value, 10\nelemental crystals are roughly\nequivalent to the earnings of an\nordinary person who doesn't eat or drink\nfor 3 or 4 years. And that's just the\nstarting point. So being a mage is\nactually a profession exclusive to\nnobles. To go far on the path of magic,\none must be wealthy enough. Fongu\nsuddenly realized. So that's how you can\nplay it. 10 elemental crystals are worth\n5,000 pieces of wood, equivalent to the\nvalue of 500 trees, which is indeed\nequivalent to several years harvest for\nan average person. And all of this is\njust to meet the requirements for\nchanging a mage's class. To be honest,\nthis price is really not cheap. It's\npractically burning money. However, the\nelemental crystals in the warehouse are\nnot of any use for the time being.\nRather than letting them gather dust, we\nmight as well use them. Anyway, as long\nas we have enough roasted meat, we can\ngo to the underground world to exchange\nthem with the rat king. Valentina kindly\nreminded her, \"Although elemental\naffinity can be cultivated to become a\nmagician, you also need to have an\nextraordinary level of understanding.\nAfter all, magical knowledge is rather\nobscure and difficult to understand, so\nyou should be prepared. Funu knew that\nValentina was reminding him that having\nelemental affinity alone was not enough.\nIntelligence also had to be up to par.\nOtherwise, even if he could enter the\nranks of magicians, he wouldn't be able\nto learn the theory of magic. But he was\nstill confident because he still had\nthree attribute points to use, which\nValentina didn't know. So he smiled and\nsaid, \"Don't worry, this shouldn't be a\nbig problem.\" So Fong Yu took out 10 of\neach of the five elemental crystals from\nthe warehouse, canceled the process of a\ncrafting table that was making a wild\nboar armor set, and started grinding\ncrystal powder. Wow, so rich. I'll get\none of each elemental type. I'll become\nan all elemental mage. Elemental crystal\ngrinding in progress. 49 minutes and 55\nseconds remaining. Looking at the\nelemental crystals in the crafting\ntable, a glint of excitement flashed in\nFong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s eyes. As long as you meet\nthe elemental affinity requirement and\nraise your intelligence to 9ine or\nhigher, you can change your class to a\nmage. Which young person hasn't dreamed\nof becoming a magician? Imagine this.\nWith a wave of your hand, a fireball\nsoarses through the air and lightning\nbolts shoot out in all directions. Just\nimagining that scene is a little\nexciting. While the elemental crystals\nwere being ground at the crafting table,\nFong Yu took a torch and went outside\nthe wooden house with his three\ncompanions. He couldn't wait to take a\nlook at his farmland. In the fire light,\nFongu saw that a wooden fence had been\nerected around the wooden house within\n10 m. To the east and west of the house,\nthere were two neat plots of farmland,\neach one square meter in size, with\nridges and irrigation ditches, which\nlooked very neat and beautiful. Manor\nCourtyard total area 100 square meters\ncan be upgraded individually. Obstacles\naround it need to be cleared to leave\nenough space. Each upgrade increases the\narea by 100 square meters and requires\n1,000 wood. Basic farmland 18 can be\nused to grow common crops. The maturity\ntime depends on the crop's own maturity\nperiod. Each farmland can be upgraded to\nintermediate farmland with 100 portions\nof bone meal. Intermediate farmland can\ndouble the yield. In addition, a 2.2 me\nwide pond was added to the north of the\nwooden house. Pond can be used to\nirrigate farmland or raise fish. The\ninitial water volume is given by the\nsystem. Players need to add water\nthemselves or collect rain water for\nsubsequent use. It can be upgraded\nseparately. Each upgrade increases the\ncapacity by 2 cubic meters and requires\n100 gravel. Funu has given up on raising\nfish. There isn't even a stream nearby,\nso where would he get fish? However,\nlooking at the 18 basic farmlands, Fong\nYu noticed the word bone meal and\nupgrade in the game assistance prompt.\nBone meal. One part bone can be ground\ninto two parts bone meal. Huh?\nProduction doubled. So, that's what\nbones are for. What are we waiting for?\nWhile many people haven't started\nfarming yet, bones in the exchange are\nstill dirt cheap with one piece of wood\nworth two to three bones. Due to the\nlarge number of players needing to\nupgrade their tools, the price of iron\ningots has skyrocketed now almost as\nhigh as the price of pork and there's a\nshortage of buyers. Many people are\nlooking to buy them on the exchange.\nFony regretted putting those 700 iron\ningots up for sale earlier. He should\nhave waited a couple of days before\nputting them up, but then he thought the\nghosts among the miners are still\ndigging new or for him, so it's not a\nbig problem. So while Fongi was in the\nroom getting crop seeds from the\nwarehouse, he exchanged 900 pieces of\nbone for 280 pieces of wood at the\nexchange. However, when he arrived at\nthe crafting table, he found that it\nwould take 90 minutes to grind 900\npieces of bone. There are still 50\nelemental crystals being ground. The\nother two crafting stations are\nproducing wild boar armor. Damn it.\nFongu realized that as his resources\nincreased, the three crafting stations\nwere no longer enough to meet his needs.\nHe had no choice but to work on them one\nby one. At this point, 10 portions of\nfire element crystals had already been\nground. Fonu took out 10 portions of\npregrown fire element crystal powder and\nsaid to Valentina, \"Just sprinkle these\npowders into the bathtub and then soak\nin it.\" Valentina nodded. It needs to\nsoak for more than an hour. So, Fong Yu\nstarted boiling water, preparing to take\na bath. Chapter 59. Learning magic. Half\nan hour later, Fong Yu poured all the\ndozen or so kettles of hot water he had\nboiled into the bathtub and then\nsprinkled fire element crystal powder\ninto the tub. Soon, he saw a red glow\nappear in the hot water. After testing\nthe water temperature with his hand and\nfinding nothing unusual, Fong Yu\ncouldn't wait to take off his clothes\nand jump in. To prevent any emergencies,\nFong Yu decided to have Valentina stay\nwith him, so he ended up wearing only\nhis underwear. \"How are you feeling?\"\nValentina asked innocently as she\nfloated beside the bathtub. Funu\nsplashed some water on his face and\nsaid, \"It's not bad. It feels quite\ncomfortable, but my skin feels a little\nstinging.\" Valentina covered her mouth\nand smiled slightly. In a little while,\nthe pain on your skin may intensify and\nthen spread to your flesh and bone\nmarrow. It will hurt a little bit, so\nyou'll have to bear with it. Huh? Fongu\nwas slightly taken aback upon hearing\nthis, thinking to himself, \"Why didn't\nyou say so before taking a bath?\"\nHowever, before he could even ask a\nquestion, he began to feel the stinging\non his skin intensify, a burning\nsensation that quickly spread from his\nskin into his flesh. At this moment,\nFong Yu felt as if he were soaking in a\nbucket of chili water. His whole body\nwas burning. Hiss. Fongu gritted his\nteeth and gasped, enduring the\nexcruciating pain as he looked up at\nValentina, asking anxiously, \"Are you\nsure you'll be all right?\" Valentina\nsmiled slightly and said, \"Don't worry,\nmaster. It's just a little bit painful.\nYou'll get through it if you grit your\nteeth. You call this a little bit of\npain? This is a ton of pain.\" Fong Yu\nwas sweating profusely from the pain,\nbut he was still gritting his teeth and\npersevering. What made his scalp tingle\nthe most was his little brother, which\nfelt like it was about to explode, but\nhe still forced himself not to utter a\nsound of pain. After all, you can't cry\nout in pain in front of a girl, right?\nHowever, Fong Yu soon realized that he\nhad miscalculated. The burning sensation\nhad begun to seep from his flesh into\nhis internal organs. While most people\ncould tolerate the pain in their skin\nand flesh, when the most vulnerable\ninternal organs began to feel intense\nburning, Fongu was finally overwhelmed\nby the pain and fainted. Seeing that\nFong Yu hadn't uttered a sound even\nafter he passed out, Valentina's eyes\nrevealed a hint of approval. Although he\nlacks talent, his willpower is strong\nenough. Valentina used her mental power\nto support Fong Yu, who was about to\nslip into the water and drown. Then\nValentina cuped Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s head in\nher hands and began to chant a\nmysterious incantation. You have\nreceived a magical lesson, meditation.\nYou have received a spell, fireball. You\nhave received a magical instruction,\nfire inscription. When Fongu woke up, he\nfound himself lying on his bed in the\nbedroom. He glanced at the glass window\non the wall and saw that it was already\ngetting light. At this moment, Fong Yu\nalso remembered that he seemed to have\nbeen taking a bath last night, absorbing\nfire element crystal powder, and then\nfainted from the pain. Thinking of this,\nFongu touched his whole body. Everything\nwas normal. He didn't feel any pain\nanywhere, and he even felt particularly\nenergetic. Funu immediately got out of\nbed, wanting to find Valentina to ask\nher what was going on, only to find that\nhe was completely naked. \"Holy crap,\nwhere are my underwear?\" Funu exclaimed.\nJust then, Valentina's voice came from\nthe living room. I saw it was wet, so I\ntook it off for you and put it by the\nfireplace to dry. It's dry now. Would\nyou like me to bring it in for you?\nFongu stood there for a moment, looked\ndown at his little brother, wiped his\nface hard, and sighed helplessly. \"Oh,\nwell, so what if I've seen it? It's not\nlike it's the first time.\" He then said\nto Valentina in the living room, \"Then\nplease bring it in.\" Of course, before\nthat, he immediately crawled into bed.\nSoon, Valentina used her mental power to\ncarry Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s underwear into the\nbedroom. Fong Yu snatched the underwear\nthat floated in front of him and put it\non under the covers. To break the\nawkward silence, he started a\nconversation by asking, \"So, how was it?\nDid that bath I took last night work?\"\nValentina smiled and replied, \"Close\nyour eyes and carefully feel your\nsurroundings. See if you can sense any\nshimmering warm elements in the air\naround you. Fongu did as instructed. He\nclosed his eyes and carefully sensed the\nsurrounding air for a while. Sure\nenough, he discovered that there seemed\nto be many extremely tiny specks of\nlight shimmering with orange light\nsuspended in the air around him. Are\nthose orange dots fire elements? Funu\nasked. Yes. Valentina nodded and said,\n\"Next, you just need to try to absorb\nthe fire elements around you according\nto the process of the fireball spell\nthat I have instilled in your mind and\nthen try to cast it.\" Fongu was slightly\ntaken aback upon hearing this and began\nto recall the memories in his mind. Sure\nenough, he found that he had some\nknowledge about low-level magic. But\nwhen he tried to cast a spell based on\nthat knowledge, he found that he could\nnot understand many of the key points.\nFor example, according to the knowledge\nof fireball spell, he needs to absorb\nthe fire element in the air. Then chant\na spell with dozens of notes while\nsimultaneously constructing a magic\ncircle about fireball spell in his mind.\nThen mobilize his magic power to\nmaterialize the magic circle in his palm\nand finally use the magic circle to\nignite the fire element to form a\nfireball. The problem was that he found\nhe couldn't absorb the surrounding fire\nelement while simultaneously chanting\nthe spell accurately and without missing\na single word and even visualize the\nmagic circle in his mind. This is insane\nmultitasking. That's too difficult. As\nexpected, being a magician is not a\nprofession that ordinary people can\npursue. Valentina naturally noticed Fong\nYu&lt;unk&gt;s problem. She smiled and\ncomforted him. For someone like you who\nhas no magical foundation, even if I\ndirectly instilled magic into you, it\nwould be difficult for you to cast it\nright away. You need to practice more. I\nbelieve that one day you will succeed.\nSomeday Fu glanced at Valentina. He knew\nValentino was comforting him and he also\nknew where his problem lay. Not smart\nenough. The game assistant said that the\nminimum requirement to become a mage is\nan intelligence of nine or higher. But\nfortunately, he still has three\nattribute points left to use. He It\nseems it's time to show off the real\nskills. So, Fong Yu silently opened his\nattribute panel with his mind and put\nall three unallocated attribute points\ninto intelligence. You have allocated\nthree attribute points to intelligence.\nAre you sure? Sure. The next second,\nFongu felt his mind clear up and his\nspirits lifted. He felt as if there was\nsomething inexplicable in his mind. Now\nwhen he tried to recall the details of\nthe fireball spell, the magical\nknowledge that had just made him feel\ndizzy and confused could now be\nunderstood at a glance. So he started\ntrying to cast the fireball spell again.\nFeel the fire element around you. Chant\na spell to absorb the fire element. Then\nconstruct a magic circle in your mind.\nThen use the magic power at your\nfingertips to materialize the magic\ncircle. And finally transfer the fire\nelement into the magic circle. Cokes. In\nan instant, a ball of orange red flame\nappeared in Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s palm. Upon\nwitnessing this scene, Valentina's\nlarge, expressive eyes widened in shock.\nChapter 60. The feeling of getting\nsomething for free is so great. You have\nsuccessfully cast your first spell,\nfireball, and are now eligible to become\na mage. Would you like to proceed with\nthe class change? Fongu glanced at the\nblazing fireball in his palm, then at\nthe system notification that appeared in\nthe air and was slightly taken aback.\nWhat are we waiting for? I committed\nsuch a heinous crime last night and even\nspent the three attribute points I had\nworked so hard to earn. All just to\nbecome a mage. Job change confirmed.\nCongratulations on your job advancement\nto mage. Your current level is mage\napprentice. He's just a magic\napprentice. Fun. You couldn't help but\nmutter. The ranks of mages are\napprentice, low-level mage, intermediate\nmage, highle mage, arch mage, grand arch\nmage, and saint archmitch, you have a\nlong way to go. Although Fong Yu was\nsomewhat dissatisfied with being just a\nmagic apprentice, Valentina couldn't\nhelp but exclaim in amazement, \"It's\nincredible, master. You clearly lacked\ntalent before, but now you've not only\nmastered the fireball spell, but you\nwere also able to cast it accurately on\nyour first try. Valentina looked at Fong\nYu with curiosity and amazement. Upon\nhearing this, Fong Yu smiled sheepishly\nand replied, \"He, maybe it's because I\nhave a special talent.\" It wasn't that\nhe wanted to show off. It was just that\nhe couldn't talk to Valentina about the\ngame, so he had to use this excuse.\nStrictly speaking, players with the game\nsystem support are indeed exceptionally\ntalented compared to the people in this\nworld. By the way, why isn't this\nfireball hot to the touch? Funu looked\nat the fireball, which was less than 10\ncm from his palm and only felt a slight\nwarmth. Because the generation and\ncontinuation of the fireball consume\nyour magic power. The heat emanating\nfrom the fireball will be converted back\ninto your magic power and absorbed when\nit comes into contact with your body and\nwill not cause you any harm. However, if\nthe magic supply is interrupted after\nthe fireball leaves your hand, the pure\nfire elemental burning will still harm\nyou. Therefore, during the casting\nprocess, the trajectory of the fireball\nafter it leaves your hand is related to\nyour own safety. So, you must pay\nattention, Valentina explained\ncarefully. I see. Fong Yu suddenly\nrealized, \"That makes sense.\" Fongu then\nasked, \"How do you control the fireball\nto fly out? I have already instilled the\nmethod into your mind. You will\nunderstand if you think about it\ncarefully.\" \"Oh, I see.\" Fongu began to\nrecall the manipulation techniques in\nthe fireball spell. At this moment,\nValentina reminded her again. \"Master, I\nsuggest you practice outside. Fireballs\nconjured by mages are not easy to\nextinguish. It would be bad if they set\nyour bedroom on fire. Damn, I almost\nforgot about that. By the way, how do we\nput out this fireball? Funu asked,\npointing to the fireball in his hand.\nJust cut off the magic supply and then\ndispel the fire element that has been\ngathered in my hand. I see. After\nextinguishing the fireball in his hand,\nFongu quickly finished washing up and\ngetting dressed. However, it was already\nbroad daylight. Valentina said to Fong\nYu regretfully in the living room. I'm\nsorry, master. I can't go out during the\nday yet, so you'll have to practice on\nyour own for now. He no problem. Fongu\nglanced at the pan fried pork chops on\nthe table and smiled slightly. You've\nworked hard, too. Go back and rest.\nWatching Valentino walk into the bedroom\nhe had arranged for her. Fu grabbed a\nfew bites of the fried pork chop on the\ntable, then hurriedly walked out the\ndoor and began practicing his fireball\ntechnique. At this moment, Funu seemed\nto be on a high, playing with fireballs\nin his left and right hands, having a\ngreat time. After all, being able to\nmake fireballs by hand is a dream for\nany boy from childhood to adulthood. Now\nthat my dream has come true, the\nexcitement I feel is even greater than\nif a goddess were standing naked in\nfront of me. In order not to damage the\nmanor and to prevent forest fires, Fongu\ntargeted the pond behind the yard as the\nfireballs target. Following the\ninstructions in the fireball technique,\nhe used his mental power to control the\nfireball which slowly flew towards the\npond. The process of controlling it is\nsimpler than you might imagine. It's\nsimilar to controlling a drone except\nthe remote control is in your mind. At\nthis moment, Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s intelligence\nhad reached 10.53,\nexceeding the standard of ordinary\npeople. Fongu remembered that the normal\nintelligence range of people in the\noriginal world was between 90 and 120.\nThat is to say, his current intelligence\nwas definitely over 120. In school, he\nwould be considered a top student.\nTherefore, he could handle the lowest\nlevel of fireball spell with ease.\nHowever, due to a lack of skill, the\nfireball's trajectory was still somewhat\nerratic, but it eventually made it into\nthe pond. Instantly, real mist rose from\nthe water's surface. The stubborn\nfireball continued to burn for three or\n4 seconds, even after it entered the\nwater until the fire element was\ncompletely burned out, and it finally\nextinguished slowly. He This fireball is\neven more effective than expected. Funu\nraised an eyebrow with a hint of pride.\nWith this fireball spell, if he\nencounters a wild boar or a giant\nspider, he can just throw a fireball at\ntheir face as soon as they see them,\ncausing continuous burning. Even if they\ndon't die, they'll be crippled.\nImmediately, Fong Yu threw out the\nsecond fireball in his hand and then\nbegan to summon the third fireball. Just\nas the third fireball was about to take\nshape, Fongu suddenly felt dizzy. And\nalthough the fireball in his hand had\ncondensed, it was less than half the\noriginal size. Huh? What's going on?\nFongu shook his slightly dizzy head,\nsomewhat puzzled. At that moment, a\nnotification from the game assistant\nappeared in the air. Your magic power\nhas been depleted. Using magic beyond\nyour maximum magic power will deduct an\nequal amount of spirit points. Please\nmeditate as soon as possible to restore\nyour magic power. Magic. Fongu opened\nthe attribute panel. And sure enough,\nthere was a new magic value at the\nbottom of his attribute panel. magic\npower 050. His mana was depleted and he\nalso discovered that his spirit was down\nby 10 points. It must be because the\nfireball he summoned at the end exceeded\nhis mana limit. So 10 points of spirit\nwere deducted. No wonder he suddenly\nfelt dizzy just now. At the same time,\nFong Yu also noticed that several new\nskills had appeared in the skill bar\nbelow the attribute panel. The first is\nthe butcher's art. The second is\nmeditation. The third is fireball. The\nfourth is flame inscription and the\nfifth is fire shield. Apart from the\nfirst skill, butchering, which he\nlearned himself from a skill book, the\nother four skills were probably all\ntaught to him by Valentina. Thinking of\nthis, Fongu suddenly slapped his thigh\nand burst into laughter. Harah, I knew\nit. Alpha and Ryan are both so powerful.\nThere's no way Valentina wouldn't know\nanything. Turns out she's a magician and\nshe can even infuse magic into herself.\nWhat a steal. Fony knew how expensive a\nskill book was. Ever since the game\nsystem announced that players could\nchange jobs, the price of skill books in\nthe exchange had increased several times\nover. He even took a look and found that\nskills like basic knowledge of potion\nmaking, basic swordsmanship, and mineral\nexploration were selling for a sky-high\nprice of 50 meat. Even the butcher skill\nthat he had bought for 10 meat had risen\nto 40 meat. And now he can actually get\nmagic skills from Valentina for free.\nThis has saved him a lot of resources.\nMoreover, Fong Yu only soaked in fire\nelement crystal powder once and gained\nfire element affinity. So Valentina only\ninfused him with three fire magic\nspells. If he soaked in other element\ncrystal powders again, he should be able\nto get other magic skills for free. Tsk\ntsk tsk. This feeling of getting\nsomething for free is so great. This\nmeans that Fong Yu only needs to find\nkey items like elemental crystals to\nunlock different magic systems. Fongu\nwanted to ask Valentina how many magic\ntypes there were among the mages, but\nthen he remembered that Valentina had\nalready gone to rest, so he had to ask\nthe game assistant instead. There are\nmany types of magic for mages. In\naddition to the five common elemental\nmages, earth, water, wood, fire, and\nmetal, there are also rarer mages with\nwind, lightning, ice, nature, light,\ndarkness, and space magic. Furthermore,\nbased on the characteristics of certain\nprofessions, there are even professions\nsuch as summoner, priest, necromancer,\nalchemist, and array master. However,\nthese rarer professions also have higher\nrequirements for job advancement.\nElemental crystals like those for wind,\nlightning, and ice are quite scarce,\nwhile law crystals required for\nlaw-based magic systems like space are\nextremely difficult to obtain, and it\nall depends on luck. Funu then asked,\n\"What about the dark and light factions?\nHow do I change my class? To become a\ndark or light magician, one must find\nthe statue of the god of darkness or the\ngod of light and then offer a sincere\nprayer. If the god responds to the\nprayer, one will receive the god's\nblessing and gain the power of darkness\nor light. Fong Yu immediately perked up\nand laughed. Hey, this is not bad. Since\nthey are the main gods, they must have\nmany statues, right? Do you know where\nthere are any statues around here? I'll\ngo and try them out when I have time.\nThere are no statues of the god of light\nnearby. And the statues of the god of\ndarkness have also been destroyed. This\nFongu side, never mind. I'll just focus\non practicing my fireball spell. Chapter\n61. Planting crops. Learning meditation.\nAlthough with Valentina's support, the\nsource of his magic skills was no longer\na concern. Fa was troubled by the fact\nthat his magic power was too low, only\n50 points. Each fireball spell consumes\n20 points of magic power, meaning he can\nonly cast two fireballs at a time. The\nthird one will require mental energy.\nWhat can you do with two fireballs? At\nmost, you can kill two small wild boares\nor spiders, and that's only if you hit a\nvital spot with a critical hit. From\nthis perspective, my current combat\nability as a magic apprentice is not\nstrong. Therefore, the most urgent task\nis to find a way to increase the maximum\nmagic power. Since Valentina cannot come\nout during the day, Funu had no choice\nbut to ask the game assistant. Mana can\nbe restored through meditation or\nautomatically. Automatic restoration is\none point every two minutes, while\nmeditation restores two points every 1\nminute. Each time you restore mana to\nyour current maximum mana limit through\nmeditation, your maximum mana limit\nincreases by one. When your magic points\nare full, you will also recover your\nspirit points during meditation. You\nrecover one spirit point for every\nminute of meditation. Meditation can\nalso clear some negative spirit\nstatuses. In addition, you can increase\nyour maximum magic power by using\nmagical items such as wands, magic\ncrystals, and magic storage rings.\nLooking at the prompts given by the game\nassistant, Fong Youu fell into deep\nthought. It must be said that meditation\nis very useful. If you rely on automatic\nmana regeneration, it will take 100\nminutes to fully restore your mana,\nwhile meditation only takes 25 minutes\nand can also restore your spirit. Of\ncourse, most importantly, it can\nincrease the maximum magic power, which\nis crucial for the advancement of a\nmage's level. As for the magical items\nthe game assistant mentioned at the end,\nFunyu didn't have any of them, so he\nprepared to go back to his room and use\nthe workbench to see if he could make\nthem. At this point, the game assistant\nissued another prompt. Enchanted items\nrequire an enchanting table to craft.\nRegular crafting tables cannot be used\nto craft them. An enchanting table.\nThere's this limitation. Does that mean\nI can't make one? Requirements for\ncrafting an enchanting table. House\nlevel reaches manner level. 10 of each\nof the five elemental crystals. 20\nsilver ingots, 10 gold ingots, five\nmyith myil ingots, and one normal\ncrafting table. Funu glanced at the\ncrafting requirements for the enchanting\ntable and breathed a slight sigh of\nrelief. Phew. Thankfully, I seem to have\nmet all these conditions. Fong Yu\nhurriedly returned to the wooden house\nand came to a crafting table. He had\nmade two extra crafting tables last\nnight to speed up the grinding of\nelemental crystal powder and bone\npowder. And now he could use them to\nmake an enchanting table. Fong Yu put\nthe 1,800 portions of bone meal and 40\nportions of elemental powders, water,\nearth, wood, and metal from the crafting\ntable into his backpack. then directly\nallocated materials from the warehouse\nto craft an enchanting table. Enchanting\ntable is being constructed. Time\nremaining 59 minutes and 56 seconds. We\nhave to wait again. Of course, Fongu\ncouldn't just sit there like an idiot.\nTaking advantage of this time, he used\nthe 1,800 portions of bone meal in his\nbackpack to upgrade all 18 primary\nfarmlands in the yard to intermediate\nfarmlands. Then he planted all the\nvarious crop seeds he bought from the\nexchange. Why not just upgrade to\nadvanced farmland? Because advanced\nfarmland requires monster manure to\nupgrade. Moreover, it's monster\nexcrement of rare or higher level. Where\nthe hell is he supposed to find that?\nSo, we have to give up for now and just\nmake do with the intermediate farmland\nfor the time being. Anyway, the only\ndifference between low, medium, and\nhighle farmland is the increase in\nproduction. He didn't expect to get rich\nby farming. 18 medium-level farmlands\nwere enough to grow food for him and his\ncompanions in the haunted house. Spring\nhas arrived, and with the temperature\nrising, more players have started\nventuring out to explore these past few\ndays. As a result, the number of items\nin the exchange has naturally increased\nwith all sorts of new foods such as\nmutton, beef, green vegetables, and\npumpkins appearing on the exchange list.\nIn addition, the exchange has seen an\nincrease in the variety of crop seeds\navailable. Crop seeds are actually quite\nprecious since everyone knows that with\nseeds and farmland, there's basically no\nneed to worry about food. However, Fong\nYu is now very wealthy and doesn't care\nabout such a small amount of money. He\nbasically buys whatever catches his eye.\nPeople who have been poor for a long\ntime and suddenly become rich always\nhave to engage in retaliatory\nconsumption and Fongu is no exception.\nIn addition, he also saw the carcasses\nof 15 wild boores in the yard which\nlooked like they were the ones Ryan had\nhunted the night before. So he spent\nanother half hour using his butchering\nskills to butcher the wild boores and\nharvested nearly 100 pieces of meat and\nvarious internal organs. Of course,\ncollecting food is secondary. The main\npurpose is to improve one's proficiency\nin the art of butchering. I wonder if\nthe wild boars in the western woods will\nbe wiped out at this rate of hunting,\nFongu said hesitantly, stroking his\nchin. I'll have to remind Ryan later to\ngo kill some spiders in the eastern\nspider forest when he has time. Meat\nchunks have recently dropped in price\nsignificantly, falling below 10 wood.\nFortunately, Fa no longer relies on\nselling meat for income. His main\nsources of income now are crafting and\nselling wild boar armor as well as the\nminerals mined for him by the ghosts in\nthe mines. Of course, these are all\nminor matters. Now that he has ghost\nminers helping him mine, he can earn\nminerals worth several thousand woods\nevery day. It can be said that he has\nbasically achieved financial freedom.\nWhat troubles him most right now is how\nto improve his strength. He has just\nbecome a magician apprentice. To\nincrease his magician level, he needs to\nincrease his maximum magic power, which\ncan only be increased by constantly\nconsuming magic power and then restoring\nit through meditation. Having thought of\nsomething, Fongu casually released three\nmore fireballs into the pond, then\nreturn to the cabin to begin meditating.\nTo enter a meditative state, you first\nneed to completely relax your body and\nassume a comfortable position. After\ntrying seven or eight different sitting\npositions, Fong Yu still felt unreed and\ncouldn't enter a meditative state.\nFinally, he tried lying down and\nimmediately realized that this was his\nmost relaxed state. Ah, as expected, for\na lazy bum like me, lying flat is the\nmost comfortable position. After lying\ndown, Fong Yu followed the instructions\nin the meditation, closing his eyes,\nrelaxing his limbs, torso, and finally\nhis brain and then integrating the\nmental energy in his mind, concentrating\nand compressing it into one point. As\nhis mental energy was continuously\ncompressed, it eventually reached a\ncritical value. The mental energy\nsuddenly exploded, clearing away all the\nchaotic thoughts in Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s mind,\nand he entered a state of tranquility.\nIn this state, he first lost his\nperception of his surroundings, then\nlost his perception of his body, and his\nentire soul seemed to float in a void.\nWithin this space, wisps of mysterious\nenergy slowly approached Fong Yu's soul.\nThese mysterious wisps quickly enveloped\nhis soul and were then absorbed by it.\nInstantly, his entire soul felt a warm\nand peaceful sensation as if he were\nfloating in the amniotic fluid of the\nwomb. Feeling incredibly comfortable in\nthis comfortable environment, Fongu\nquickly forgot about continuing his\nmeditation and fell asleep. A moment\nlater, Alpha, the stray dog beside the\nbed, looked at Fong Yu, who was lying on\nthe bed snoring, and sighed helplessly.\nWhile most people fall asleep without\nrealizing it during their first\nmeditation session, you fell asleep in\nless than a minute. Isn't that a bit too\nbad? Just as the dog jumped onto the bed\nto wake Fong Yu. It suddenly realized\nthat the magic in the surrounding air\nseemed to be slowly being absorbed by\nFong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s body. Alfa's eyes widened\nimmediately. What's going on? Wasn't he\nasleep? How can he still absorb\nsurrounding magic through meditation?\nWas he just pretending to be asleep? So\nthe dog leaned in and licked Fong\nYu&lt;unk&gt;s face. There was no response.\nThen the dog stretched out a paw and\npoked Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s arm. There was still\nno response. Okay, so that's what it\nmeans to be asleep. This is insane. How\ncan someone meditate while sleeping?\nAfter hesitating for a long time, Alpha\nfinally decided not to bother Fong Yu\nanymore, jumped off the bed, and\nreturned to the living room. Chapter 62.\nThe master seems to have become smarter.\nFongu didn't wake up until noon. He felt\nlike he had never slept so comfortably\nin his life. He felt completely relaxed\nand full of energy. Why is this\nhappening? Could it be because of\nmeditation? However, I think I fell\nasleep halfway through my meditation.\nFunu scratched his head completely\nconfused. At this moment, the game\nassistant sensed Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s confusion\nand answered his question. Once the mana\nis fully restored, continuing to\nmeditate will increase the spirit. Once\nthe spirit exceeds the limit, the player\nwill gain a state of euphoria,\nincreasing all attributes by 10%. Mental\nstate can exceed the maximum by up to\n50% and it will deduct at a rate of one\npoint per minute. When mental state\nfalls below the maximum, the state of\neuphoria will disappear. After reading\nthe assistance prompts, Fun Yu\nunderstood that meditation had such\nunexpected benefits. His mental value\nwas currently 100. No. Upon closer\ninspection, Fong Yu discovered that his\nmaximum mental value had actually become\n150 plus an extra 75 points, making it a\ntotal of 225 points. H But why did the\nmaximum mental value increase by 50?\nAfter you change your class to a mage,\nyour maximum spirit stat will increase\nby 50. Please check your character panel\ncarefully. Although he was criticized by\nthe game assistant, Fongu was still very\nhappy because he knew that for any game,\nthe player's panel attributes were\nextremely important. If he encounters\nmonsters or dangerous places that reduce\nhis spirit points in the future, his\nextra 50 spirit points will give him a\ngreat advantage. This should be\nconsidered a hidden advantage of mages.\nPutting everything else aside, even now\nhe can cast two and a half more\nfireballs with the extra 50 points of\nmental energy. Upon thinking of the\nfireball spell, Fong Yu immediately\njumped out of bed and rushed outside.\nAfter all, playing with fireballs can be\nquite addictive. 5 minutes after leaving\nthe house, Fong Yu, feeling completely\ndrained, returned to the house looking\ndejected. Sigh. Fong Yu sighed softly.\n51 points of magic power. Even with 225\npoints of spirit power, only a total of\n276 points. One fireball consumes 20\npoints of magic power, so I can only use\na maximum of 13 fireballs. It's really\nnot enough to last long. But what could\nhe do? Fong Yu knew that Rome wasn't\nbuilt in a day. And he couldn't become\nfat overnight. If he wanted to increase\nhis magic power, he could only keep\nconsuming magic power and then\nmeditating to replenish it and increase\nhis magic power limit. Although it is\ntime-consuming and laborious, it is\nstill something that can be seen and\ntouched. He estimated that meditation\ncould restore two points of magic power\nper minute. He currently had a maximum\nof 51 points of magic power, so it would\nbe fully restored in less than half an\nhour. However, if he used up his magic\npower as soon as it was fully restored\nand then immediately continued\nmeditating, if you stick to it for 10\nhours a day, wouldn't that increase your\nmaximum magic power by about 20 points?\nIn less than 3 days, your magic power\nwill more than double by 100 points.\nThat means your stamina will double.\nFongu specifically checked the upgrade\nrequirements for the mage profession.\nHis current level is magic apprentice.\nto upgrade to a low-level mage. The\nminimum requirement is to reach 100\nmagic power and learn three beginner\nlevel spells. I already have the three\nbeginner level magic cubes. All that's\nleft is to increase my magic power. This\nmeans that if he persists for 3 days, he\ncan be upgraded from a magic apprentice\nto a low-level magician. The problem is\nif he spends 10 hours a day practicing\nmagic and meditation, he won't have time\nfor anything else. But who cares?\nAnyway, I have enough supplies right\nnow. I have no worries about food and\ndrink. There are miners working on mines\nand a large area of farmland is growing\nvegetables and fruits. Even if I stay\nfor 10 days or half a month without\ngoing out, it won't be a problem. Right\nnow, all he can think about is how to\nquickly level up his magician level and\nthen learn more advanced magic skills\nfrom Valentina. After all, a man's death\nis often caused by a teenager. For a\nteenager, nothing is cooler than casting\nmagic. Fireball alone isn't enough. I\nalso need to learn fire dragon, fire\nmeteor, the cooler the better. Thinking\nof these things, a rare bright light\nflashed in Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s eyes. A man who\nis usually a lazy bum. Of course, he\nalso understood that great strength is\nthe foundation of everything. If one is\nnot strong enough, even if one has a lot\nof resources, in the end, one will only\nbenefit others. Therefore, improving\none's own abilities is more important\nthan anything else. After lunch, Fong Yu\nquickly resumed his meditation. To\nprevent himself from falling asleep\nagain, he specifically asked Alpha to\nwake him up every half hour. And so,\nuntil night fell, Fongu meditated 10\ntimes, and his maximum magic power had\nincreased to 61 points. At that moment,\nValentina floated out of her room. Fong\nYu told Valentina about his day and\nasked if there was a faster way to\nincrease his maximum magic power.\nBesides magical items, there is another\nway to increase the maximum amount of\nmagic power, Valentina said after\nrecalling for a moment. What method?\nFunu asked expectantly. A magic crystal\nis created by a mage of archage level or\nhigher. And then you use the magic\ncrystal to increase your maximum magic\npower, Valentina said. Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s\nface immediately fell. Where was he\ngoing to find a magician? It would be\npointless to explain this method. Fong\nYu waved his hand and said, \"Forget it.\nI'll rely on myself.\" By the way,\nthere's another question. I'm currently\nlearning fire magic. Probably because I\nsoaked in fire element crystal powder\nyesterday. If I soak in powders of other\nelemental crystals, will I also gain\naffinity with those elements and be able\nto use magic of those elements?\nValentina nodded and said,\n\"Theoretically, that's true, master, but\nI strongly advise against learning\nmultiple magic systems at the same time.\nThat would distract you and hinder your\nprogress in magical mastery.\" \"I\nunderstand. So, having multiple magic\nsystems at the same time doesn't\nconflict, but it's best to focus on one\nelemental system, right?\" Funu asked.\n\"That's right. That's what I mean.\"\n\"Then there's no problem,\" Funu said\nwith a smile. I didn't plan to study so\nmany elemental systems at the same time.\nI mainly wanted to learn them all first,\nsee which one suits me best, and then\ndecide which one to major in.\nValentina's eyes lit up slightly upon\nhearing Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s words. This was\nexactly what she wanted to say to Fong\nYu, but she hadn't expected that Fongu\nhad already thought of it himself.\nValentina looked at her master, blinked\nher large eyes slightly, and thought to\nherself, \"It seems like my master has\nbecome a little smarter since I last saw\nhim.\" Chapter 63. Summer arrives. Time\nto become a butcher. For the next two\ndays, aside from eating, sleeping, and\ntaking a bath at night, Fongu spent\nalmost all his time using magic to\nconsume his mana, and then meditating to\nrestore his mana and increase his mana\ncap. Of course, he also squeezed out\nsome time to water the farmland in the\nyard and to cook lunch. Apart from that,\nhe never stepped out of the manor again,\nnor did he go out to collect any\nsupplies, nor did he even go to see the\nmine. Although he didn't go out to\ncollect supplies, he still made a lot of\nmoney these past few days. All of the\nmore than 200 sets of wild boar armor he\nmade had been sold. Each set costs seven\nwild boar hides and eight linen cloths\nworth about 50 wood, but it is listed on\nthe exchange for 300 wood, a profit of\nsix times. The price of 300 pieces of\nwood may seem high, but it's actually\nabout the same as the value of hunting\ntwo wild boars. Anyone who knows the\nmath knows that with this set of wild\nboar armor, not only is survival and\ndefense guaranteed, but you can also use\nthe passive skill of the wild boar set\nto sneak into wild boar herds at any\ntime to hunt them at that time. Let\nalone two boores, even 10 or eight\nboores will not be a problem. No matter\nhow you look at it, it is a worthwhile\ndeal. Therefore, no one thought Fong\nYu's wild boar traps were expensive.\nEveryone was scrambling to buy them. In\nother words, Fong Yu used about 15,000\npieces of wood as cost. And after\ndeducting the cost, he earned more than\n70,000 pieces of wood worth of\nmaterials, including the supplies he had\npreviously stockpiled. His current net\nworth has exceeded 100,000 in timber\nvalue. This is just what he earned after\nselling the first batch of wild boar\narmor. In the past few days, he has been\nbuying wild boar hides and linen at low\nprices at the exchange every day. Once\nhe has bought them, he puts them in the\ncrafting table to make wild boar armor\nand sells them. He is living a simple,\nboring, and tedious capitalist life\nwhere he can make a fortune everyday\nwhile lying at home. Every night, Ryan\nwould take his axe and go for a walk in\nthe woods. He took Fong Yu's advice and\nwent to the spider forest in the east\ninstead. Every day, he would bring back\na dozen or 20 giant spider corpses and\npile them up in the yard. After several\ndays of continuous killing, Fong Yu\nnoticed that the muscles on Ryan's\nskeleton were becoming more and more\nmuscular, and he was starting to\nresemble those skinless, muscular\nmonsters from Attack on Titan. Not only\nRyan, but Valentina's originally\ntranslucent spirit body has also become\nmore and more condensed in the past 2\ndays. If you don't look closely, apart\nfrom not having a shadow, it looks no\ndifferent from a real person. It is\nlikely that she went out hunting with\nRyan at night and absorbed a lot of soul\nenergy. She can now appear in the early\nmorning and evening and Fong Yu no\nlonger needs to cook breakfast and\ndinner for her. However, she still needs\nto avoid the midday sun when it is most\ndazzling. So, Fong Yu still has to\nprepare lunch for himself. After being\nfed these past few days, Alpha has\ncompletely lost interest in raw meat.\nEven plain grilled meat isn't enough to\nattract it. It has to be seasoned with\ncumin. Yes, Fong Yu has spoiled Alpha's\ntastes and made it quite fat. Now, it\nlooks like a plump, round dog, although\nFong Yu and Valentina sometimes tease\nAlpha about its size. But Alpha doesn't\ncare. In fact, it especially likes to\nlie sprawled out on the ground, showing\noff its round belly. I don't know what's\nwrong with it. One morning later, Fong\nYu woke up from the heat while covered\nby a blanket. He kicked off the blanket\nand got out of bed. Why is it so hot?\nFongu asked puzzled. It's the second day\nof summer and also the hottest day of\nthe year. I suggest you stay indoors to\navoid the heat. Summer. Fongu suddenly\nrealized that he had been holed up in\nthe manor for 3 days. No, that's not\nright. He's in seclusion. He's in\nseclusion, cultivating his magical\npower. Yes, that's exactly it. He's a\nhardworking and exemplary young man.\nAfter giving himself a pep talk, Fong Yu\nwent to the bathroom, dipped his face in\nthe cool water in the bucket, and then\nwiped it. Damn it, I'm speechless. I\nnever thought summer would be even\nharder to endure than winter. Fong, you\ncouldn't help but complain. At least in\nwinter, when it's cold, you can cover\nyourself with a blanket and warm\nyourself by a fire, but this summer heat\nis just unbearable. At this moment, Fong\nYu missed the electric fan, air\nconditioner, and ice cream in real life.\nHe glanced at the chat channel and\nalmost everyone was complaining about\nhow hot it was in the summer. Some\nplayers even said that their houses were\nbeing baked by the sun. That's\nabsolutely outrageous. Many people are\nalso saying that there are a lot of\nmosquitoes outside their houses and they\nare as big as fists. That fist is that\nbig. Who the hell could withstand that?\nMany players have reported being bitten\nby mosquitoes and even poisoned.\nFortunately, the mosquito venom is not\nfatal. It only causes weakness and\nintense itching at the bite site.\nHowever, a genius named Zung in the chat\nchannel came up with a way that could\nboth cool you down and prevent mosquito\nbites. That means soaking yourself in a\ncold water bath, then covering your head\nand face with mud, leaving only your\nnostrils open to breathe. Fong Yu almost\nburst out laughing when he saw this\nmethod, but he had to admit that it was\nquite practical, costing only one large\nwooden bucket and a dozen buckets of\ncold water. Seeing this, Fong was a\nlittle puzzled. He didn't seem to see\nany mosquitoes or even insects near his\ncabin. Is it because this is a haunted\nhouse that the insects dare not\napproach? He that should also be\nconsidered one of the advantages of\nhaunted houses, right? Even without the\nmosquitoes, the sweltering summer heat\nwas unbearable. So much so that Fong Yu\ndidn't even feel like eating breakfast.\nThen he remembered that he seemed to\nhave watermelons among his crops and\nthat they were ripe today. In this\nunbearably hot weather, the only way to\ncool down besides soaking yourself in\ncool water is to eat watermelon. Fong Yu\ncouldn't wait to step out of the wooden\nhouse. But as soon as he stepped\noutside, the scorching sunlight shining\non him made him cry out in pain and hide\nback under the eaves. Damn it. Fong Yu\nrubbed his stinging skin hard and\ncursed. This isn't the sun, it's an\noven. With no other option, Fong Yu went\nback inside and found a linen garment to\ncover his head. Braving the scorching\nsun, he went to the fields and sure\nenough saw more than a dozen round green\nwatermelons lying in the three fields\nwhere watermelons were planted. Haha,\njust as I thought. No air conditioning.\nWatermelon will cool you down. Fong Yu\nthen went to the field, quickly\nharvested 12 watermelons, put 11 of them\ninto the pond to cool them down, and\ntook the remaining one home to crack\nopen and eat as a meal. After taking a\nbite of watermelon, Fong Yu couldn't\nhelp but burst into laughter. Harah,\nthat's awesome. Of course, he didn't\nforget to share a slice of watermelon\nwith the little spider cherry blossom\nand asked Alpha if he wanted some.\nPerhaps because of the hot weather,\nAlpha, who usually only eats meat,\nsurprisingly asked for a slice of\nwatermelon. After eating a few slices of\nwatermelon, Fong Yu felt the heat\nfinally subside. He then remembered that\nhis magic power had reached 99 before he\nwent to sleep last night and the\nmeditation before going to sleep should\nhave raised his magic power to 100. So\nhe opened the attribute panel and saw\nthat sure enough the maximum magic power\nhad become 100. He knew that he had met\nthe requirements to become a low-level\nmage. So he clicked upgrade without\nhesitation. A pale purple light suddenly\nenveloped Fong Yu. And after a moment, a\npurple six-pointed star magic circle\nslowly disappeared between Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s\nforehead. This was a blessing from the\ngod of magic. At this moment, he finally\ngained the approval of the god of magic\nand became a true magician. You have\nreceived the blessing of the god of\nmagic and have randomly learned one\nexclusive skill, magic breathing. Magic\nbreathing passive reduces the mana cost\nof all spells by 10%. The reduction\nincreases by 10% for each level your\nmage gains up to a maximum reduction of\n50% in mana cost. Holy crap, it even has\na unique skill, Fongu's eyes widened.\nThis skill called magic breath\neffectively increases his maximum mana\nand it can also be upgraded reducing\nmana consumption by up to 50%. It's safe\nto say it's an extremely useful skill.\nWhat a pleasant surprise. In addition,\nFong Yu has been using the butchering\ntechnique to dissect the carcasses of\nthe prey that Ryan brought back these\npast few days. His butchering technique\nproficiency has reached 96 out of 100.\nAs long as he uses it four more times,\nhe can upgrade the butchering technique\nto intermediate level. At that time, he\ncan also complete the butcher job\nchange. After waiting for the sun to set\nand the temperature to drop, he hurried\noutside and began to use his butchering\nskills to dissect the spider carcasses\nin the yard. After the spider corpse was\ndecomposed, Fun Yu's butchering skill\nfinally reached the intermediate level,\nso he couldn't wait to click on the\nbutcher job change. After all, becoming\na butcher increases your strength\nattribute by two points. So, how can you\nmiss out on such a freebie? Fong, you\nclicked on the job change without\nhesitation. Congratulations, you have\nsuccessfully become a butcher. The\nbutcher's job change doesn't have the\ndazzling special effects of changing to\na low-level mage, nor does it have any\nblessing from the butcher god. Apart\nfrom gaining two points of strength on\nthe attribute panel, the only other\nthing is to get two passive skills,\nkilling intent and weakness eye.\nPervasive killing intent. Passive as a\nprofessional killer, your hands are\nstained with too much blood. An\ninvisible killing intent follows you\nlike a shadow, causing a deterrent\neffect on players with a mental value\nbelow 50, a fear effect on players with\na mental value below 20, and a fear\neffect on lower creatures. Eye of\nweakness. Active as a professional\nkiller, you have dismembered countless\nprey and are quite familiar with the\nanatomy of creatures. When you use eye\nof weakness on a target, you can quickly\nidentify its weak points. Dot. Unlock\nexclusive weapon, Butcher's Bone\nCrusher, rare. Butcher's Bone Crusher.\nRare. Equipping Butcher's Bone Crusher\nreduces the casting time of the\nButcher's skill by 50%. Wounds inflicted\nby the Bone Crusher will bleed\ncontinuously for 30 minutes, deducting\n1% of maximum health per minute. Chapter\n64. Strength is the foundation. After\nreading all the information about the\nbutcher profession, Funu was completely\nshocked. Those two passive skills, one\ncan intimidate and frighten enemies with\nlow spirit and the other can directly\ndetect the enemy's weakness are both\nhighly practical combat skills.\nMoreover, that exclusive weapon, the\nbutcher's bone crusher, not only\nshortens the casting time of the\nbutcher's technique, but it can also\ninflict a 30inut bleeding effect on\nenemies. It deducts 1% of their maximum\nhealth per minute. If used properly, it\ncould have unexpected effects. The last\nskill he'd heard of related to bloodshed\nwas that of the Noxian executioner.\nAlthough in essence, there is no\ndifference between executioners and\nbutchers. This is insanely awesome,\nFongu exclaimed. This is a butcher\nclass, it feels even more powerful than\na mage. At this point, the game\nassistant provided an explanation. Each\nclass has its own characteristics. Mages\nhave a high entry barrier and are weak\nin the early game, but become as\npowerful as an army at higher levels.\nButchers, on the other hand, have a low\nentry barrier, are strong in the early\ngame, but are less useful in the late\ngame. Is that so? Fongu scratched his\nhead, expressing his doubt. Yes.\nFirstly, neither of the Butcher's two\nskills can be upgraded. The killing\nintent skill only works on enemies with\nlow spirit and low-level creatures,\nwhich is a big limitation. As the\nenemies and monsters you encounter in\nthe future become stronger, this passive\nskill becomes meaningless after you\nreach the next level. That seems to make\nsense. As for the skill eye of weakness,\nit's not as powerful as you might\nimagine. The weaknesses of normal\nanimals and humans are nothing more than\nthe eyes, neck, and similar areas.\nAnyone with a brain can see them without\neye of weakness. This skill only becomes\nuseful when you encounter some monsters\nyou've never seen before. Now that you\nmention it, this skill seems pretty\nuseless. Funu's excitement gradually\nsubsided. And that butcher's boning\nknife, it only takes half an hour to\nreduce health by 30%. How many enemies\nwill just stand there dumbfounded and\nwait to bleed to death after you've\nstabbed them? After being given a\nreality check by the game assistant,\nFong Yu came to his senses. Indeed, the\nbutcher's two skills and weapon looked\nvery powerful, but at the same time,\nthey were also extremely limited, making\nthem rather useless. However, Fong Yu\nalways had a good attitude. Having\nsomething was better than having\nnothing, and who knew it might come in\nhandy someday. Moreover, he decided to\nmajor in magic, and the butcher\nprofession was just a bonus for learning\nthe art of butchering. If it weren't for\nthose two free points of power, he\nwouldn't have bothered to switch to\nbutcher. Speaking of magicians, after\ntwo days of hard work, Fong Yu's\nmagician level has been upgraded from\nmagic apprentice to low-level magician,\nso he is not in a hurry to continue\nmeditating for the time being. As the\nsaying goes, don't bite off more than\nyou can chew. He planned to stay at the\nlow-level mage level for a few days to\npractice the magic of the other four\nelements he had learned before and see\nwhich element was most suitable for him.\nWith an hour left before nightfall,\nFongu decided to go to the mine to\ncollect some supplies. Having not been\nto the mine for 2 days, Fongu believed\nthat the ghosts must have stockpiled a\nlot of minerals, especially a type of\nsalt peter ore. Fu remembered that the\ngame assistant had told him before that\nsalt peter or could be used to make ice\nblocks on such a hot day how wonderful\nit would be to have a slice of chilled\nwatermelon. Of course, he didn't forget\nto roast another 100 pieces of spider\nmeat to take with him so he could\nexchange them for good things with the\nrat king in the underworld. After\neverything was ready, Fongu took Alpha\nto the mine. Fortunately, the journey\nwas mostly through forests, so it wasn't\ntoo sunny. Upon arriving at the mine,\nFong Yu discovered that Steve's 10\nghosts were not mining in the pit, but\nwere chatting in the inner room of the\nwooden cabin. When they saw Fong Yu,\nthey all warmly gathered around him.\n\"Oh, Mr. Fong Yu, you finally arrived.\"\n\"We've all been waiting for you for a\nlong time,\" Steve said. Fong Yu asked,\npuzzled. \"What happened? Did something\nhappen in the mine?\" Steve shook his\nhead and said, \"The pickaxes you gave us\nlast time are all damaged. Because we\ncan't leave the mine, we can't get the\nwood needed to make the pickaxes.\nWithout tools, we can only stay in the\ncabin and wait for you.\" Upon hearing\nthis, Fongu slapped his forehead. He had\nbeen so focused on practicing magic\nthese past 2 days that he had forgotten\nthat these tools had a limited lifespan.\nUnder the tireless use of the ghosts,\nthe iron pickaxe would naturally break\ndown quickly. How long have you been out\nof work? Funu asked. It only takes a\nlittle over half a day. How much less or\nwould be mind in half a day? Fong Yu\nfelt a pang of pain in his heart.\nHelpless, he could only console himself\nby thinking of it as giving these ghosts\na half day off. So Fong Yu used the\ncrafting table in the mine along with\nthe wood in his backpack and the iron\ningots in the mine's furnace to make 50\niron pickaxes. Taking advantage of this\ntime, Fongu collected all the ore, iron\ningots, and other ores that the ghosts\nhad mined and forged in the past few\ndays. Obtained 2,230\ngravel, 375 coal, 42 iron ore, 227\nsulfur or 360 nitrate or 65 silver or 25\ngold ore. As the ghosts unearthed more\nand more minerals, Fongu specially made\neight more wooden boxes to place in the\nmine to store the minerals so that the\nseven iron boxes wouldn't be enough. Of\ncourse, this raises a question. What if\nother players discover this mine and\nthen enter to steal things? This is\nactually quite likely since the area of\nzone 6 shouldn't be too large and it's\nlikely that nearby players will discover\nit. To prevent this from happening, Fong\nYu and Steve discussed it and decided\nthat in the future when they went down\ninto the mine to mine, they would leave\none or two ghosts in the mine above to\nwatch over it. If any unfamiliar\nstrangers entered, they would come out\nand scare them away. In the early\nstages, a gloomy haunted mine would\nlikely deter most players since even\nFong Yu doesn't have a good way to deal\nwith ghosts right now. They are immune\nto physical attacks and only fire,\nlightning, and light magic can cause\nthem some damage. After arranging the\nsituation in the mine, Fongu glanced at\nthe mine that had begun operation and\nsmiled. With this mine, he essentially\nhad a goose that laid a continuous\nstream of golden eggs. Even though his\ncontract with the ghosts was for a year,\nhe could still go underground to trade\nwith the rat king, which was also very\nprofitable. If we calculate it\ngenerally, earning several hundred,000\nunits of timber value in a year is not a\nproblem. However, he also thought of a\nproblem. If he didn't become a lord, he\nwould have to pay 5% of the lord's\ntaxes. Although a 5% tax rate may not\nseem like much, it depends on the total\namount. For players with low income, a\n5% tax might only amount to tens or\nhundreds of wood per year. But for Fong\nYu, 5% of his income could mean\nthousands or even tens of thousands of\nwood. In the long run, that will amount\nto a considerable expense. But if he\nbecomes a lord, there will definitely be\na lot of messes waiting for him to deal\nwith. So where will he have time to\nimprove his strength? It's important to\nknow that for a mage to advance in rank,\nthey not only need to spend a lot of\nresources, but also a lot of time\nmeditating. In this lawless world of\nsurvival, one's own strength is the\nfoundation of everything. If one's own\nstrength is insufficient, then no matter\nhow many resources one has, in the end,\none will only benefit others. Is there\nany way to avoid being a lord and paying\ntaxes? Funu frowned and began to think.\nA moment later, he came to a conclusion.\nThere is only one answer. To support a\nlord and then become the de facto ruler\nbehind the scenes. The two conditions\nfor becoming a lord are having the most\nresources and receiving the most votes\nin player elections within the region.\nHe should have no problem getting the\nmost resources. The rest is just\nfiguring out how to get the votes in the\nelection so he can manipulate the lord's\nelection. If both of these prerequisites\nare met, then all he has to do is find\nsomeone he trusts or can control, get\nhim to meet one of the conditions for\nbecoming a lord, and then withdraw from\nthe final lord election. As for the\nspecifics of how to proceed, we need to\nthink about it more carefully. Fongu\ncame up with a way to win votes, it was\nactually very simple. When the hearts\nand minds of the people and make all the\nplayers in the district like him, then\nthe final votes would fall into his\nhands. There is only one way to win the\nfavor of all players in the region. Give\nthem certain benefits. After thinking\nabout it, he posted a lot of tips and\nmethods on exploring and collecting\nresources near the spawn point in the\nchat channel and even mentioned that he\nmight receive rewarding scenario\nmissions. This way, other players can be\nencouraged to actively explore and\ncollect resources, thereby improving\ntheir ranking in terms of overall\nresource availability while also gaining\ngoodwill. It's a win-win situation,\nwhich is great. Chapter 65. There are\nmany lucky players, so you still have to\nplay it safe and develop your character\ncautiously. Fun Yu sharing about\nexploring outside successfully sparked a\nheated discussion among players in the\nchat channel. Immediately, many players\njumped out and said that they had also\ndiscovered strange things and most of\nthem were related to job changes. A male\nplayer said that he discovered a giant\nstone statue tens of meters high holding\na sword and guarding the mountain. After\nworshiping it, he was blessed by the\nstatue and received the inheritance of\nthe great swordsman. A female player\nsaid that after she rescued an injured\ncolorful bird, the bird brought her a\ndruid flower the next day, allowing her\nto successfully change her class to a\nnature mage, a druid. Even more\nremarkably, one player was chased by a\npack of wolves and fell off a cliff,\nonly to land in a cave on the cliff\nface, where he found a dragon egg, which\nhatched into a dragon. He then gained\nthe chance to become a dragon knight.\nSeeing the incredible adventures of\nthese players, Fong Yu suddenly felt\nthat inheriting such a haunted house in\nthe woods wasn't so outrageous after\nall. It seems there are still a lot of\nlucky players in this game. I can't be\ntoo careless and need to continue to\ndevelop cautiously, Fongu thought to\nhimself. At present, his resources\nshould be the best, but his combat\nstrength is another story. Although he\nhas changed his profession to a mage, he\nis still only a low-level mage. So, his\ntop priority is to improve his strength.\nOf course, while there are quite a few\nplayers who have received special\nopportunities compared to the total\nnumber of 6,895\nplayers in all six regions, this\npercentage is actually not high, less\nthan 1%. Yes, after 3 days in spring and\n2 days in summer, more than 200 people\ndied in District 6. However, neither\nFong Yu nor the other players care so\nmuch about the death toll anymore.\nMoreover, the rate of player deaths has\nslowed down significantly, much better\nthan in the early days of the game when\nhundreds or thousands of players would\ndie every day. After all, this is a\nsurvival game and death is the norm. The\nonly difference is how many die. Those\nwho are still alive now still have some\nsurvival skills and unless they\nencounter any sudden danger, they are\nnot so easy to die. Although cross\nregion chat is not yet available between\ndifferent regions, it is now possible to\nview the number of survivors in other\nregions through the world chat.\nCurrently, the region with the most\nsurvivors is still zone 6 with 6,995\npeople, followed by zone 3 with 5,265\npeople. The third place has seen a\nprecipitous drop with only 4,212\npeople remaining. Zone 1 is in the worst\nsituation with only 1,959\npeople left. As the saying goes, there\nis no harm without comparison. Looking\nat this data, the advantage of zone 6 is\nalready very obvious. The reason why so\nmany people in zone 6 have survived is\nactually well known to most players in\nthe zone. They have to thank the big\nshot named Fong Yu who shared a lot of\nuseful information. Although other\nplayers can also obtain information\nthrough their game assistants, the game\nassistants will only answer questions\nwhen players actively ask them. If they\nare really in danger, it will be too\nlate to ask. Therefore, Fong Yu's\nadvanced explanation is still very\nmeaningful to them. In this\nsurvival-driven world where everyone is\non edge, selfishness is the norm. Most\npeople adopt an indifferent attitude as\nif it's none of their business,\nespecially those with strong survival\nskills who are rarely willing to share\ntheir strategies. In their view, why\nshould they share the survival\ninformation they risk their lives for\nfree with others? You should be doing\nothers a favor by not causing trouble\nfor yourself. Therefore, players in zone\n6 truly admire big shots like Fong Yu\nwho are willing to share valuable\ninformation. So during this time, the\nchat channel was filled with endless\npraise for Fong Yu, and the day the game\nsystem announced for selecting the Lord\nwas fast approaching, and Fongu was\nundoubtedly the most popular choice in\nserver 6. Of course, Fong Yu also\nfrequently encouraged players to go out\nand explore to collect resources. Even\nthough Fong Yu encouraged players to go\nout and explore again, many players\nstill dared not go out due to safety\nconcerns, especially female players for\nwhom venturing out was still too\ndangerous. So Fongu added in the comment\nsection, \"You can use red mushrooms to\nhunt some wild boars. After you get the\nboar hides, I'll make you wild boar\narmor.\" Funs words sparked another wave\nof excitement in the comment section.\nZung Ursian ID1213.\nI missed out on the set you sold before.\nYou better make more this time. Zhao\nMing ID211. I bought a set a couple of\ndays ago and to be honest, this wild\nboar armor is really useful. I've\nalready used the passive ability of this\nwild boar armor to sneak into a wild\nboar herd and kill several wild boores.\nLee Chinlong ID212. I want one too,\nboss. I raised a baby earth dragon and\nthis guy eats so much. I need to get the\nwild boar set quickly to hunt wild\nboores. Otherwise, I'll have nothing to\nfeed it. Dong Hao. ID 3356. I don't have\nenough materials. Can you make it first\nand I can exchange it for other\nresources? Jeang Yaoyang. ID 2296.\nFong UID006.\nBrother, make me a set first and I'll\nreturn the supplies to you after I hunt\na wild boar. How about it? Lu Hashe ID\n9123. Is the person upstairs an idiot?\nThey think they can be on friendly terms\nwith this big shot. Funu ID006. Dad,\nmake a set for your son. I'm begging\nyou. Seeing the increasingly outrageous\ncomments in the comment section, Fongu\nshook his head helplessly and replied to\neveryone. If you want to make the wild\nboar set, add me as a friend and mail me\nthe wild boar hide. I can give you a 20%\ndiscount. After these words were spoken,\nthe comment section quieted down\nconsiderably and some players with\nmalicious intentions started stirring up\ntrouble, saying that Fong Yu was trying\nto scam everyone out of supplies and\nthat they shouldn't be fooled. Fong Yu\nignored the trolls comments and\ncontinued sharing information about\nscenario missions. He emphasized that if\nyou encounter anything strange or a\nstrange place, you should explore it\ncarefully as you might trigger a\nscenario mission with very generous\nrewards. Of course, because he didn't\nwant to flaunt his wealth, Fong Yu\ndidn't talk about his adventures in the\nmine and the underground world. Instead,\nhe made up a lie, saying that he found\nthe relics of a dead magician in an\nabandoned cave and obtained the\nmagician's legacy. As the saying goes,\nman dies for wealth, birds die for food.\nAnd after seeing the huge benefits that\nexploration can bring, many players\nfinally began to get restless and\nstarted thinking about how to explore\nthe surrounding area. Meanwhile, more\nthan a dozen players who felt Fong Yu\nwas trustworthy added him as a friend,\nnoting that they were willing to give\nhim supplies first so that he could help\nthem make wild boar armor. Chapter 66.\nMonsters in the underground world. Crypt\ndwarfs. Fong Yu was raised to be a good\nand kind person, and he truly adhered to\nthis principle until he graduated from\nuniversity. But when he left the\ngreenhouse of school and entered\nsociety, the harsh reality taught him\nthat always trying to be a good person\nwould only make him a pushover who would\nbe bullied by everyone. Therefore, after\nbeing severely beaten by reality several\ntimes, he realized that kindness without\nresources or ability is a very foolish\nact. Therefore, in this game world, Fong\nYu always adhered to the principle of\nputting his own interests first. He\nwould not pity other players just\nbecause they were starving, nor would he\ngive them any benefits because of a few\nflattering words from other players.\nHowever, people are still human, and\nFong Yu is willing to help those players\nwho truly believe in him and support\nhim. Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s act of having players\nvoluntarily mail him wild boar hides was\nactually a test of them. Only those who\ntruly trusted Fong You would send him\ntheir hard-earned wild boar hides for\nfree, even when they were not wealthy\nthemselves. In fact, many players even\nmailed the processing fee directly to\nus. Fong Yu was still somewhat moved as\nhe saw the letters arriving in his inbox\none after another. These players were\nall willing to trust Fong Yu. So Fong Yu\nsilently memorized their names. If they\nencountered difficulties in the future\nand needed his help, he would be happy\nto lend a hand. At the same time, Fong\nYu also reduced the processing fee,\nwhich was originally 10 times the profit\nto two times, which is equivalent to a\n20% discount as a gesture of goodwill\ntowards the players who trusted him. Of\ncourse, he did this not just out of\ngoodwill, but also with a deeper\nconsideration. Currently, many players\nacross the region have formed factions\nand their own forces, all eagerly\npreparing to become lords. Therefore,\nFong Yu naturally needed to gather a\ngroup of players who supported him. This\nwould make it easier for him to find a\nsuitable candidate from among these\nplayers who could replace him as the\nlord. After collecting the materials\nsent by the players, Fongu put them all\ninto the crafting table and started\nmaking the wild boar armor set. He then\nleft a message for the players saying\nthat he would mail the armor to them\nonce it was finished that night. After\nfinishing these tasks, Fong Yu placed\nall 50 pickaxes he had made in the\nghosts wooden huts and then prepared to\nsupplies with the rat king. With their\npickaxes, the ghost descended into the\nmine shaft with Fong Yu. Accompanied by\nthe ghosts, Fong Yu and Alpha quickly\narrived at the Rift Valley at the bottom\nof the mine. After saying goodbye to the\nghosts, Fong Yu and Alpha descended the\nslope beside the Rift Valley to the\nbottom. As soon as he reached the bottom\nof the valley, Fong Yu heard a series of\nsqueaking sounds from the rats. He then\nsaw that the rock rats around him kept\ntheir distance, and he could see the\ndeep fear in their eyes. Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s\neyes lit up, and he immediately guessed\nthe reason. Hei, it must be the\nbutcher's passive skill that has been\nactivated. Although the butcher's\npassive skill may not be useful in the\nfuture, it's still very useful now. For\none thing, when he goes to places with\nlots of snakes, insects, rats, and ants,\nthe murderous aura emanating from him\nwill keep those lower animals away,\nwhich will reduce a lot of trouble for\nhim. But soon, Fongu realized something\nwas wrong. The first two times he came,\nthe rock rats would escape into the cave\nleading to the rat king's cave. But now,\nhe found many rock rats rushing out of\nthat cave. And one even bumped into Fong\nYu's leg in its panic. Something's not\nright. Fong Yu frowned. He felt that\nsomething terrible had happened in the\nrat king&lt;unk&gt;'s cave, which was why\nthese rock rats had abandoned their own\nnest and were running away in a frenzy.\nFong Yu knew that only natural disasters\nsuch as floods or earthquakes could make\nrodents, which have a strong sense of\ngroup identity, abandon their nests, and\nflee. So Fong Yu asked Alpha if it had\nany premonitions about floods or\nearthquakes, since the dog had a strong\nsense of natural disasters. However,\nAlpha shook its head. If it's not a\nnatural disaster, then what could it be?\nIn order to find out what exactly\nhappened in the Rat King's cave, and in\norder not to make a wasted trip, Fong Yu\nand Alpha still went into the cave and\nheaded towards the Rat King's cave. When\nFong Yu and Alpha entered the cave, one\nexuded demonic blood, and the other was\nfilled with intense killing intent,\nwhich frightened the rock rats that\noriginally wanted to escape from the\ncave, forcing them to turn back the way\nthey came. Soon, before Fong Yu even\nentered the Rat King's cave, he heard a\nseries of piercing rat cries coming from\nthe cave ahead. The cries were very\nshrill, and it wasn't just one rock rat\ncrying, but a whole group of rock rats.\nHolding the torch, Fong Yu quickened his\npace and finally arrived at the entrance\nof the cave a dozen seconds later.\nilluminated by the torch in his hand,\nFongu saw the small mountain of minerals\npiled up in the center of the cave. But\nthe one standing on top of the mountain\nwas not the golden-haired fat rock rat,\nbut a bloated monster that was 2 m tall\nand covered in green fur. At this\nmoment, the dwarf was swinging his club,\nbeating the rock rats that were\nscurrying around in the cave. The dwarf\nwas extremely strong, and the rock rats\nthat were hit were almost all killed\ninstantly, either with their brains\nsplattered or their bones broken and\nintestines spilling out. All of them\ndying in extremely gruesome ways. No\nwonder the squeaking of the rats I heard\nbefore was so mournful. Those were the\npitiful cries of rats before they died.\nWhat shocked Fong Yu even more was that\nafter killing the rock rats, the dwarf\ndemon actually picked up the rock rat\ncorpses and stuffed them into its mouth,\nthen bit them and tore them apart.\nInstantly, the rockrat's corpse was torn\nin two, and a large amount of blood and\ninternal organs were splattered on the\ndwarf demon's body. But it only cared\nabout enjoying the flesh and blood in\nits mouth. Seeing the terrifying\nbehavior of those green monsters, Fun Yu\nunconsciously took a step back. To be\nhonest, he was disgusted by those green\nmonsters. What the hell is this thing?\nFunu frowned. He seemed to remember the\nminor ghosts telling him that there were\ngreen monsters in this underground\nworld. Could this be the one in front of\nhim? At this point, the game assistant\nprovided the answer. Crypt dwarfves.\nCrypt dwarves are the lowest of the\ndemon races. They are dull-witted, live\nin the dark and damp underground world,\nand have degenerated eyesight, but keen\nhearing. This thing that's over 2 m tall\nis actually called a dwarf demon. You\nmust be kidding me. That's because\nnormal demons are all over 3 m tall.\nChapter 67. Fireball spell is useless.\nCan you withstand that explosive charge?\nJust as Fong Yu was looking at the\nmonster information displayed by the\ngame assistant, the crackling sound of\nhis torch attracted the attention of the\ncave dwarf, which turned around and\nfaced him. At this moment, Fongu also\ngot a clear look at the monster's face.\nIt has two round bumps on its forehead\nand a layer of fine green scales on its\nexposed green skin. The eyes are two\nfleshy slits, so it's hard to say\nwhether it has vision or not. However,\nit has two green furry ears like a\nrabbit and a tuft of messy whiskers that\ndrag on the ground on its chin. Just as\nFong Yu was standing there observing the\ndwarf demons appearance, the dwarf demon\nsuddenly grinned and roared at Fong\nYu&lt;unk&gt;s location, then charged towards\nFong Yu with the club in its hand. Damn\nit. They started attacking right away.\nSeeing that things were not going well,\nFong Yu quickly retreated. Given the\nlarge size difference between himself\nand his enemy, maintaining distance was\nthe wisest choice. At the same time,\nFongu used the butcher's skill, Eye of\nWeakness, on the charging dwarf. Eye of\nweakness has been used. Target: Crypt\nDwarf. Cost 10 spirit points. This\ncreature's weaknesses are its ears on\nthe top of its head and its anus.\nTherefore, it seems that this monster's\nweaknesses are not much different from\nthose of humans. Fong Yu quickly jumped\nbackward to dodge the sweeping club of\nthe dwarf demon. But due to inertia, he\ncrashed into the rock wall behind him.\nAt that moment, the dwarf demon swung\nhis club a second time. Again, aiming\nprecisely at Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s body. It\nseems this guy has a very strong ability\nto locate sounds. Having landed on the\nrock face, Fong Yu had no choice but to\nquickly do a lazy roll to barely dodge\nthe dwarf demon's second attack.\nHowever, the sound of Fong Yu rolling on\nthe ground still gave away his location.\nThe large ears on the dwarf's head\ntwitched slightly, and Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s\nlocation was locked again. Fongu was\nvery anxious. If the other party kept\nlocking onto his location with their\nhearing, he would be forced to keep\ndodging and would have no chance to\nescape, let alone fight back. This won't\ndo. We need to distract it. Fong\nYu&lt;unk&gt;s first thought was to pick up a\nstone from the ground and throw it into\nthe distance to interfere with the\ndwarf's hearing. But it was clear that\nthe dwarf had no intention of giving\nFong Yu the chance to pick up a stone.\nThe club in his hand was raised high\nagain, ready to smash it down on Fong Yu\nagain. Just then, Alpha, who was\nstanding to the side, finally couldn't\nstand it anymore. It let out a cry and\nrushed forward. After a leap on the\nground, it pounced on the dwarf's head\nand then stretched out its sharp claws\nto grab the dwarf's huge ears. However,\nalthough the dwarf was dull-witted by\nnature, it was quick to react. With a\nsudden movement, it swept Alpha away\nfrom its head. Alpha's claws only\nmanaged to leave three scratch marks on\nthe dwarf's brow before crashing into\nthe rock wall beside it. However, Alpha\nalso possessed demonic blood, so this\nminor injury had little effect on it. It\ninstantly got up from the ground and\nroared at the dwarf demon again. It was\nobvious that Alpha was deliberately\ndrawing attention and provoking the\ndwarf. It was actually capable of taking\ndown the dwarf alone, but it saw this as\na good opportunity to train its master.\nThe dwarf's attention was now\nsuccessfully drawn to Alpha, who had\nscratched it. It abandoned its plan to\nattack Fong Yu and began chasing Alpha\nthrough the cave. However, Alpha's\nagility was unmatched by those rock\nrats. Although the dwarf demon swung his\nclub with great force, he didn't manage\nto touch Alpha's fur once. While Alpha\nwas dealing with the dwarf demon, Fong\nYu, who had a chance to catch his\nbreath, immediately began to chant the\nincantation for a fireball spell in a\nlow voice. Soon, a fireball the size of\na basketball appeared in his palm. He\ndecided to teach this ugly monster a\nlesson. Taking advantage of the moment\nwhen the dwarf demon swung at Alfro\nagain, Fong Yu manipulated a fireball to\nsmash towards the dwarf demon. Bang!\nFong Yu's fireball technique hadn't been\npracticed for nothing these past few\ndays. Under Fong Yu's mental control,\nthe fireball accurately struck the dwarf\ndemon's chest, instantly exploding and\nsending countless sparks flying onto the\ndwarf demon's upper body, burning it and\nmaking it howl in pain. However, that's\nall. The green scales on the dwarf's\nskin seemed to effectively resist the\nscorching flames. When the dwarf dropped\nthe club and extinguished the flames on\nits body with its hands, the burned\nareas were only slightly blackened\nwithout any open wounds. The dwarf\nremained as lively as ever. \"Holy crap!\"\nFong Yu exclaimed in shock. \"Is this\ndwarf demon's defense this insane?\"\nAfter extinguishing the fireball\noverhead, the dwarf picked up the club\non the ground and chased after Alfro\nagain, seemingly unaware of where the\nfireball had come from. Since that's the\ncase, Fong Yu conjured another fireball.\nThis time, he aimed for a while before\nfinally seizing the opportunity to smash\nthe fireball at the pair of green ears\non the dwarf's head. Those ears are\nprobably made of soft skin and downy\nhair to better detect the source of the\nsound. And the inside of the oracle is\nsoft flesh without any scales covering\nit. If a fireball hits there, it should\nhave a good effect. Fong Yu then chanted\nthe fireball spell again, summoning a\nfireball that smashed towards the\ndwarf's ear. However, just as the\nfireball was about to hit the dwarf's\nhead, the creature seemed to hear\nsomething in the air rushing towards his\near. He instinctively raised his free\nleft hand to block it, and half of the\nfireball was blocked by the dwarf's\npalm. Fortunately, the other half still\nhit the dwarf's right ear. Instantly,\nscorching flames engulfed the dwarf's\nfurry right ear. A woo! The dwarf threw\naway the club again, raised his hand to\ncover his ears, and fell to the ground,\nstruggling as if the injury to his ears\nwas causing him great pain. Meanwhile,\nAlpha took the opportunity to start\nbiting the dwarf's thigh, but with\nlittle success. After a while, the\ndwarf's struggles gradually subsided,\nand it seemed that he was ready to get\nup and fight again. Holy crap, this\nthing has such a thick health bar. Two\nfireballs weren't enough to take it\ndown. At this point, the game assistant\nprovided a timely prompt. The crypt\ndwarves dwell near underground lava\npools and possess extremely strong\nresistance to fire elemental magic. Damn\nit, what a coincidence. Fongu cursed\ninwardly. The only magic he knew was\nfire magic. Since the magic resistance\nis high, I'll just use physical magic to\nsubdue the demons. Fong Yu gritted his\nteeth, took out a makeshift explosive\ncharge from his backpack, lit the fuse\nwith a torch, and quietly threw it\nbetween the dwarf's legs while the dwarf\nwas still in a days. According to the\neye of weakness, another weakness of the\ndwarf is its groin and anus. So throwing\nthe explosives there is the most\nappropriate option. I'll cultivate both\ndemonic and magical powers. Let's see if\nyou can withstand it. Having witnessed\nthe power of explosives, Alpha dodged\nimmediately. A few seconds later, boom.\nAfter a violent earthquake, a large\namount of smoke and dust billowed out.\nThis time, a heart-wrenching scream came\nfrom within the smoke and dust. However,\njudging from the increasingly weak\nscreams, the guy must have been\nseriously injured and was probably not\nfar from death. However, Fongu was not\nin a hurry to go forward to check. He\nknew that any creature's last stand was\na fierce counterattack, so he simply\ntook out a second explosive charge and\nheld it in his hand, ready to light it\nand throw it over if things went wrong.\n2 minutes later, the dust from the\nexplosion finally settled. Fong Yu\npatted his head, which was ringing from\nthe blast, and cautiously approached. He\nsaw that the dwarf demons lower body had\nbeen blown away and green blood, bits of\nflesh and internal organs were\nsplattered all over the ground. The\nchaotic scene and the stench almost made\nFong Yu vomit. To Fong Yu surprise, the\ndwarf demon was still alive, weakly\nhowling and struggling on the ground.\nFong Yu gasped upon seeing this. This\nthing's vitality was extraordinary.\nFortunately, Fong Yu always kept a few\nsimple explosive packs in his backpack\nfor emergencies. Otherwise, killing this\ndwarf demon would have been really\ndifficult. Just as Fongu was pondering,\nAlpha pounced and bit the dwarf's neck,\nsnapping its throat bone. H, what a\nvicious dog. Chapter 68. Searching for\nthe origin of the crypt dwarf. Soon, the\ndwarf was torn apart and died completely\nby alpha. Phew, it's over. Funu breathed\na sigh of relief and sat down to rest.\nThis was the strongest monster he had\nencountered since coming to this world.\nFar stronger than the wild boar and\nspider he had met before. Not only were\nits attack and defense extremely high,\nbut it also had extremely high\nresistance to fire magic, rendering his\nbest fireball spell useless. If it\nweren't for Alpha's distraction and\ntaunts, diverting the dwarf demon's\nattention, Fong Yu wouldn't have even\nhad a chance to catch his breath, let\nalone retaliate with explosives.\nFortunately, Fong Yu had the skill Eye\nof Weakness, which allowed him to\ndiscover the dwarf demon's weak points,\nits ears and groin. This gave him the\nopportunity to use a fireball and a\ndynamite pack to take down the\ntroublesome creature. By this time, all\nthe rock rats in the cave had fled, and\nthe elemental crystals and ores piled up\nin the center of the cave had been\ncollapsed by the aftershocks of the\nexplosive charge. After resting, Fongu\ncame to the corpse of the dwarf demon\nand used the butcher's technique to\ndissect the dwarf demon. Rewards: 12\npieces of dwarf elf meat. The meat is\ntough, but it is non-toxic and harmless,\nso it is safe to eat. eight bones, two\npieces of magic patterned scales, blue,\nand one spiked club. Fa would definitely\nnot eat these pieces of dwarf meat. No\nmatter how it tasted, he found it\ndisgusting. As for Alpha, it was very\npicky about food now. If it didn't have\nhands, it would probably be using\nchopsticks to eat. However, Fong Yu\nbelieves that some players with a taste\nfor the bizarre and extreme might be\ninterested in the dwarf demon meat\nscraps. Of course, what interested Fongu\nthe most were those two pieces of magic\npattern scales. He remembered them so\nwell that his fireball spell couldn't\neven burn through them. Magic pattern\nscales, blue leather armor produced by\ncave dwarves. It has extremely strong\nresistance to fire and high\ntemperatures, making it a rare fireproof\nmaterial. It's actually a rare blue\nquality material. Does that mean the\nequipment crafted from it will be\nbluegrade? Unfortunately, obtaining\nequipment of green quality or higher\nrequires crafting blueprints, so\nmaterials alone are not enough. However,\nbased on his previous experience with\nacquiring items, Fongu judged that to\nobtain blueprints for items related to\nmagic pattern scales, he would most\nlikely have to search for them in the\nlayer of the dungeon dwarfs. If a single\ncrypt dwarf is this troublesome, then\ngoing to their layer would be tantamount\nto suicide. So Fong Yu temporarily put\naside any blueprints and began searching\nfor the golden rat king's whereabouts.\nHowever, after searching around, he\ncouldn't find the golden rat king.\nInstead, he found the crown in the\ncollapsed door pile. Is that guy dead?\nIf the rat king really dies, it will be\na huge loss for Fongu as he will no\nlonger be able to exchange for those\nrare ores and crystals. However, the\nmost important thing right now is not\nthe rat king, but this crypt dwarf. Why\nis it here? And is it really the\nunderground monster that the miners\nghosts are talking about? Just as Fongu\nwas wondering, Steve and a group of\nghosts walked out of the cave Fongu had\ncome from. The moment Steve saw Fong Yu,\nhe said, \"Thank God, Mr. Fong Yu. We're\nso glad you're all right. We just heard\na huge explosion and thought something\nhad happened to you.\" But as soon as\nSteve finished speaking, he saw the cave\ndwarf lying at Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s feet. Only\nits upper body remaining. Instantly,\nSteve was so frightened that he floated\nup from the ground. \"Monsters! It's\nthose underground monsters!\" Steve\nshouted, pointing at the dwarf's corpse.\n\"They're back. We have to run!\" After\nSteve shouted, the other ghosts\npanicked. Just as they were about to\nturn and run away, Fongu shouted and\nstopped them. \"Hey, hey, don't go. Look\nclosely. It's dead. After hearing Fong\nYu&lt;unk&gt;s words, Steve stopped and turned\nto take a closer look at the dwarf's\ncorpse on the ground. He then discovered\nthat the dwarf only had its upper body\nleft, and it looked like it was indeed\ndead. This Steve looked at Fong Yu in\nshock and said, \"You killed it.\" Fongu\nshrugged and said calmly, \"Yes, to be\nhonest, this guy was quite difficult to\nkill. It took two of my fireballs to\nkill it, and I finally had to use a\nmakeshift explosive pack to take it\ndown. Upon hearing this, the ghosts\nlooked at the dwarf demon's charred head\nand blasted lower body, and they all\nbelieved Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s words. Ghost\nSteve exclaimed with admiration, \"Mr.\nFong Yu is truly amazing. Even three or\nfive fully armed soldiers might not be\nable to defeat this kind of underground\nmonster. How could you take it down all\nby yourself?\" Another ghost said,\n\"Didn't you hear Mr. Fong Yu say that he\nused a fireball spell?\" So, Mr. Fong Yu\nis a magician. A magician. In an\ninstant, all the ghosts were filled with\nawful Fong Yu because in their minds,\nmagicians were the most powerful people\nin the world. Not only powerful, but\nalso noble. All right. All right. This\nisn't the time to discuss this. Fongu\ninterrupted the ghosts and asked, \"Were\nyou all killed by this thing back then?\"\nThe ghosts nodded, looking at the\ndwarf's corpse on the ground. They\nseemed to recall their tragic deaths,\ntheir expressions filled with sorrow.\nGhost Steve said, \"These monsters are\nferocious and numerous. If one has\nappeared, it means there will be many\nmore. We must get back to the surface\nimmediately and seal the mine again.\" A\nclosed mine pit. Fongu raised an\neyebrow. The disappearance of the rat\nking had already deprived him of a path\nto wealth. If the mine were to be sealed\noff as well, it would reduce a large\namount of the mine's income. Fony was\nnot happy about this. How could he just\ngive up the two sources of income that\nhe had worked so hard to develop? He\nthen turned to Alpha and asked, \"Are\nthere any other dwarves around here?\"\nAlpha sniffed around carefully before\nshaking its head. \"Can you find out\nwhere this dwarf came from?\" This time,\nAlpha nodded. \"That's good,\" Fong Yu\nsaid to the ghosts. \"This monster must\nhave come here through some passage.\nI'll blow up that passage. It's better\nthan sealing off the mine. In order to\nsave the mine, Fongu was prepared to\ntake a risk. The ghosts looked at each\nother, all very worried, and urged Fong\nYu to return to the ground with them.\nDon't worry, I know what I'm doing. With\nAlpha around, as long as it determines\nthat the surroundings are safe, there's\nnothing to worry about. After quickly\ncollecting all the ores and crystals on\nthe ground into his backpack, Fongu\ncalled out to Alpha and asked him to\nlead the way to find the dwarf demon's\norigin. Since the ghosts couldn't stray\ntoo far from the mine, they had no\nchoice but to return to the mine and\nwait for Fongu to come back. Chapter 69.\nThe mysterious underground palace.\nAlpha, we're counting on you for the\nrest of the trip. If we sense any\ndanger, we're out of here. Understand?\nAlpha nodded, twitched its nostrils\nslightly, and ran toward another exit of\nthe cave, seemingly having found the way\nthe dwarf had come. Fongu followed\nAlpha's figure through the crisscrossing\ncaves, and within 2 minutes, he felt a\nlittle dizzy. The underground caves were\ninterconnected and lacked any clear\nlandmarks. Fongu knew he couldn't\nremember the way he came, so he had to\nrely on Alpha. Fortunately, Fong Yu saw\nmany flattened or smashed rock rat\ncorpses along the way, and there were\neven some ores and elemental crystals\nscattered next to those corpses. H why\nare these ores and crystals scattered\nhere? Fongu wondered, could it be that\nthe dwarf demon is also interested in\nthese ores and crystals? So, he came to\ncompete with these rock rats for\nresources. Fongu guessed, but something\ndidn't seem right. Filled with doubts,\nthe man and the dog quickly arrived at a\nvertical cliff. Fongu took a closer look\nand realized that this was not a cliff\nat all, but a wall made of black stone\nbricks. He tried to raise the torch to\nsee how high the wall was, but he\ncouldn't see the top of the wall no\nmatter how far the torch light reached.\nTherefore, this is clearly a man-made\nstructure, and on a grand scale, it is\nvery likely an underground palace. At\nthis moment, Fun Yu also remembered the\nkey to the underground palace treasure\nchest that he had obtained in the rat\nking&lt;unk&gt;s den and became even more\ncertain of his guess. If this is the\nlayer of the cave dwarves, then it's far\ntoo big. It's hard to imagine how many\ncave dwarves are hidden inside.\nTherefore, Fong Yu became even more\ncautious. He lowered his footsteps and\ncarefully walked along the wall for\nnearly a 100 meters before finally\nseeing a large gate made of black iron\nin the fire light. It was a huge iron\ngate more than 30 m high made of black\niron. It was decorated with strange\nghosts, demons, and unknown monsters.\nWhile in the center of the gate was the\nimage of a towering giant. This towering\ngate reminded Fong Yu of the massive\nsteel gate in Shanghai from Lord of the\nRings. grand and terrifying, as if it\nheld endless monsters. Fun Yu&lt;unk&gt;s\nintuition told him that the underground\npalace behind this door was not a place\nhe could enter now. It must be extremely\ndangerous inside. It's very likely that\nthere are other monsters hidden inside\nbesides the crypt dwarf. Alpha, what do\nyou think? Should we go in? Funu asked\nAlpha, who was standing next to him.\nWoof. The dog nodded, then shook its\nhead. Huh? What do you mean by shaking\nyour head? Fong Yu asked puzzled. Woof\nwoof. Never mind. Forget I asked. At\nthis moment, Alpha turned and ran\ntowards a corner of the wall. Guided by\nthe dog, Fong Yu saw that there was a\nlarge circular hole with a diameter of 1\nm in that corner. However, compared to\nthe 30 m high gate next to it. This 1 m\nhole is as inconspicuous as a mouse\nhole, etc. A mouse hole. Funu\nimmediately understood. He bent down and\nshone his torch at the cave entrance.\nAnd sure enough, he saw many fine hairs,\nmostly brown, with one or two golden\nones. Fonu remembered that the fur of\nordinary rock rats was brown, while\nthose few golden hairs should belong to\nthe golden rat king. In addition, he\nalso found a tuft of coarse green hair,\nwhich if he was not mistaken, should\nhave come from the dwarf demon. So fun,\nyou tried to deduce it. So that dwarf\ndemon came out of the wall through this\nrat hole and then followed the rat's\ntracks to find the rock rat's lair. The\ndog being the only listener nodded in\nagreement. Then what are we waiting for?\nLet's just plug up this hole and that'll\nbe the end of it. Fong Yu then began\nsearching his backpack for something to\nplug the hole. But after a while, he\nfound that he only had 100 pieces of\nroasted meat to exchange for supplies\nwith the rat king and nine simple\nexplosive packs. The remaining wood and\nrubble seemed insufficient to plug the\nhole. What should we do? Fongu was in a\ndilemma. If he couldn't block the hole,\nthere was no guarantee that more dwarf\ndemons would emerge from it. One or two\nwould be manageable, but if there were\ntoo many, he wouldn't be able to stay in\nthis underground world. In that case, he\nmight really be forced to blow up the\nmine again for the safety of the manor.\nAlternatively, another method is to use\na simple explosive charge to blow up the\npassage leading from the rock rat's nest\nto here, which should also temporarily\nstop those dwarves from heading towards\nthe mine. Just as Fongu was caught in a\ndilemma, he suddenly heard a familiar\nsqueaking sound coming from the cave\nentrance. Judging from the voice, it\nsounds like the rat king. Fongu raised\nan eyebrow. Is it still inside this\ncave? So, Fong Yu asked Alpha, take a\nsniff. Is the rat king still in the\nhole? Alpha approached the cave\nentrance, sniffed it, and then turned\nback to nod at Fongu. Really? Fongu had\nbeen wondering why he hadn't seen the\nrat king's corpse or any trace of it in\nthe rock rat's nest. Turns out it was\nstill in the hole. At this moment, the\nsqueaking of the rat king in the hole\nbecame even louder. Fongu knew that the\nrat king was intelligent. He guessed\nthat the rat king must have also\ndiscovered that he and Alpha were at the\nentrance of the hole, which was why it\nwas making loud noises to attract his\nattention. But why should it attract my\nattention? It's highly likely that it's\ntrapped and wants Fongu to rescue it.\nShould we save them or not? If I were to\nbe rescued, I would have to enter this\ncave where everything is unknown. With\nmy current strength, I would have a hard\ntime dealing with just two dwarf demons\nat the same time. If three or more\nappeared, then it would be a matter of\none word, danger. But if we don't save\nhim, the rat king's route to exchanging\nrare ores will be cut off, which would\nbe such a pity. Just as Fongu was\npondering, the creaking sounds from\ninside the cave grew louder, which made\nFong Yu realize a problem. The Rat\nKing's loud call should have triggered a\nreaction from the monsters if there were\na large number of dwarf demons inside.\nBut Fong Yu didn't hear any other noises\ndespite its prolonged calls. Could it be\nthat there are no dwarf demons in this\ncave? To verify his idea, Fong Yu\nglanced at the dog at his feet and said,\n\"Alpha, you're fast. Go in and see if\nthere are any other dwarf demons.\" Upon\nhearing this, Alpha did not hesitate and\nrushed into the cave entrance. A moment\nlater, Alfa rushed out again and shook\nits head at Fongu. Since that's the\ncase, in order to continue making deals\nwith the rat king, let's go and save\nhim. So, Fong, you carefully walked into\nthe cave entrance holding a torch.\nChapter 70. The guardians of the\ntreasure vault. After entering the cave,\nilluminated by the fire light, Fong\nYu&lt;unk&gt;s eyebrows slowly rose, for he\nsaw vast continuous mountains of\ntreasure. There are crystal mountains\nmade entirely of elemental crystals,\ngold coin mountains made entirely of\ngold coins, and jewel mountains made\nentirely of precious gems and jade. The\nsmall mountain of, or he had seen in the\nrat king&lt;unk&gt;'s den, was only a little\nover 1 m high. But this treasure\nmountain was as tall as three or four\nstories. These treasure mountains\nreflected a dazzling light under the\nfire light, making Fong Yu dizzy. So,\nthis place is actually a huge treasure\ntrove. A treasure trove bigger than a\nfootball field. The powerful visual\nimpact completely stunned Fong Yu. After\na while, Fong Yu came to his senses. He\ntouched his pigkin backpack and sighed.\nThis probably can't hold much, can it?\nHowever, Fong Yu, who had extensive\nexperience in treasure hunting films and\nliterature, suddenly realized that such\ngiant treasure troves usually concealed\ndangerous mechanisms or formidable\nguards. Fong Yu did not believe that\nthis survival game would expose such a\nlarge treasure to players without any\nrisk. Who knows, the moment I pick up\nsomething, I might trigger some\nmechanism or even a curse or awaken some\nmonster to guard me and hunt me down.\nTherefore, the cautious Fong Youu didn't\ntake anything. He simply followed Alpha\nfor more than 20 meters along the wall\nuntil he finally saw a golden lump of\nflesh. It is the Rat King. However, at\nthis moment, the Rat King was locked in\nan iron cage, gripping the iron bars\nwith its two short, thick front paws,\nlooking pitifully at Fong Yu. Judging\nfrom this, it must have sneaked in, been\ncaught, and locked up here. Squeak,\nsqueak, squeak. The rat king squealled\nexcitedly upon seeing Fong Yu arrive.\n\"Should be quiet,\" Fong Yu said, then\nlooked at the lock on the iron cage\ndoor. Perhaps because he was certain\nthat the rat king&lt;unk&gt;s short paws could\nnot open the lock, the latch was not\nclosed, but was only symbolically\ninserted into the bolt. Therefore, Fongu\nopened the lock very easily. To his\nsurprise, after the rat king was\nreleased, it did not immediately run\ntowards the cave entrance, but instead\nburrowed into the treasure mountain.\nHey, Fongu tried to call out to the rat\nking, but it was too late. The rat king\nhad already disappeared into the\ntreasure mountain. What is this guy\ntrying to do? Fongu didn't quite\nunderstand the rat king's behavior. He\nhad risked his life to save it, but it\ndidn't even say anything after being\nrescued, nor did it run away. Instead,\nit went straight into the treasure pile.\nFeeling somewhat annoyed, Fongu decided\nto ignore the guy's life or death and\nwas about to call Alpha to go back when\nhe heard Alpha growl. Fongu was startled\nand had a bad feeling. He followed\nAlfa's gaze and saw that there was a\npair of emerald green eyes in the\nshadows of the wall where he had come\nfrom. The pupils of those eyes were\nvertically almond shaped. If Fongu\nremembered correctly, eyes like that\nbelong to either a cat or a snake. Of\ncourse, that's not the key point. The\nkey point is that these eyeballs are way\ntoo big. Each one is as big as a fist.\nAnd those huge green eyes were staring\nintently at Fong Yu and Alpha. I was\ncareless. I was so careless. Looking at\nthose fist-sized eyes in the shadows,\neven a fool would know that the owner of\nthose eyes must be some kind of giant\nmonster. Fa was filled with regret. He\nshould have realized that based on his\nprevious encounter with the dwarf demon,\nit was unlikely that the clumsy dwarf\ndemon could capture the agile rat king.\nTherefore, there must have been someone\nelse who captured the rat king. And now\nthis being is right in front of him,\nwatching him intently. Under the gaze of\nthose giant green eyes, Fun Yu&lt;unk&gt;s\nskin crawled with goosebumps. He knew\nthis was a biological instinct, warning\nhim that the owner of those eyes was\nsomeone who could easily take his life.\nSure enough, the next second,\nilluminated by the torch in Fong\nYu&lt;unk&gt;s hand, the owner of those eyes\nslowly emerged from the shadows. It was\na black cat's head about 1 m in\ndiameter, while its body remained hidden\nin the shadows, its length unknown. Holy\ncrap. If its head alone is 1 m in\ndiameter, then with its body included,\nit must be four or 5 m long. Is that a\ncat? Even saber-toothed tigers weren't\nthis big. At this moment, a prompt from\nthe game assistant appeared. Titan cat,\nan ancient giant cat kept by the titans.\nIt is enormous in size, but timid and\nsuspicious. It likes to toy with its\nprey. You'd better find a way to run\naway. You are no match for it now. After\nreading the message, Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s\neyebrows practically flew off his feet.\nTitans or Proas? Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s world\nview was once again refreshed. Looking\nat the cat in front of him, which was\nalmost the size of an elephant, he\ncouldn't see how docil it could be.\nPerhaps it's because I feel so\ninsignificant. So, does this lead to\nmegalophobia in the presence of giant\ncats? As Fong Yu curiously examined the\nTitan cat, the giant cat was also\nobserving the two tiny creatures before\nit. As the cat's head slowly approached,\nAlfa's growls grew louder, and its\nyellow fur began to turn red from the\nroots. This is the first time Alpha has\ntransformed during a battle. Even when\nfacing the crypt dwarf, it was able to\nhold back its strength. But now it has\nbeen forced to transform before the\nbattle even started. This is enough to\nshow how terrifying this black cat is.\nNo wonder. No wonder the rat king ran\nstraight to the treasure mountain as\nsoon as it was released from its cage.\nIt must have known about the giant cat's\nexistence all along. In fact, it was\nprobably caught and put into the iron\ncage by this giant cat. Damn it. We got\nscrewed over by that little bastard. At\nthis moment, the giant cat's attention\nhad been drawn to Alpha after his\ntransformation. After consuming the\nblood of the cave dwarf, Alpha's size\nincreased significantly. If its original\nsize resembled a husky, it was now about\nthe size of an Alaskan malamute. With\nits red fur flying everywhere after the\ntransformation, it looked even more like\na fierce Tibetan mastiff. Even so, in\nfront of the giant cat, Alpha still felt\nno different from a slightly larger\nmouse. And the giant cat only showed\ncuriosity when looking at Alpha without\ntaking it seriously at all. Because the\ntwo are not even in the same league in\nterms of size. However, the giant cat\nsoon paid the price for underestimating\nits opponent. When the giant cat tried\nto scratch Alpha with one of its front\npaws, Alpha simply raised its front paw\nand scratched back at the giant cat's\noutstretched hand. A flash of red light\nappeared and three deep scratches\nappeared on the giant cat's paw pad.\nMeow! The giant cat in pain shrieked and\nwithdrew its paw, its curious expression\ngradually turning cold. It looks like\nthis giant cat is about to get serious.\nChapter 71. Every cause has an effect.\nFongu really wanted to ask the witty\nnizens what he should do when faced with\na giant cat that was almost the size of\nan elephant. And this giant cat seems to\nbe angry. I need help urgently. I'm\nwaiting online. Of course, at this\nmoment, no netizens can offer him\nadvice. He can only rely on himself. So,\nwhat else can we do? When faced with a\nfeline, a primate like myself can forget\nabout running away. The only way is to\nfind an opportunity to fight back. Even\nif I can't kill or defeat it, I should\ntry to scare it away. Even if things go\nwrong, at least you can die with some\ndignity. Most importantly, just don't\nexpose your back to it. Exposing one's\nback to a feline is as irresistible as a\nwoman undressing in front of a man.\nTherefore, Fongu made a decisive move,\ntook out a bag of simple explosives, and\nlit the fuse with the torch in his hand.\nThey used their ultimate move right from\nthe start. Not to harm the enemy, but to\nscare away the giant cat with the loud\nnoise and flash of the explosion, thus\nbuying time to escape. Just as the fuse\nburned, the black cat in the shadows\nlaunched its attack on Alpha. In Fong\nYu&lt;unk&gt;s vision, he only saw a black\nshadow flash by before Alpha let out a\nwhale and was sent flying, landing in\nthe treasure mountain a dozen meters\naway. Couldn't even last this one round.\nFongu was shocked. At the same time, the\ngiant cat once again turned its gaze to\nFong Yu. Fong Yu swallowed hard. He knew\nhis body wasn't like Alphas, blessed\nwith demonic blood. If the giant cat\nwere to slap him, he'd probably be\nspitting out his own So, without\nhesitation, he threw the improvised\nexplosive device he was holding at the\nblack cat, saying as he threw it,\n\"Here's something fun for you.\" Perhaps\nFong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s words had an effect\nbecause the black cat didn't dodge the\nexplosive charge thrown at it. It even\ncuriously lowered its head to examine\nthe small sparking package that landed\nin front of it, seemingly treating it\nlike a toy. However, the next second,\nboom. Having anticipated this, Fongu had\nalready thrown himself to the ground. As\nthe flames and shock waves from the\nexplosion spread outwards, Funu heard\nthe giant cat's painful howls. Meow. The\nscream faded into the distance in less\nthan 3 seconds, and the cat's meow\nseemed to have already moved to the\nother side of the treasure vault. Damn\nit. Even an explosion right next to its\nface couldn't kill that thing, and it\ncan even cross a distance of nearly 100\nm in 3 seconds. Is this the kind of\npower a carbon-based life form should\nhave? However, Fongu didn't have time to\nthink much at this moment. He quickly\ngot up from the ground, took out a\nsecond explosive pack from his backpack,\nlit it without hesitation, and then\nmoved towards the cave entrance while\ncounting the time. Since the first\nexplosive charge failed to kill that\nguy, it might come back for revenge. So,\nthe safest way is to keep the explosive\ncharge in hand and light the second one\nas soon as the first one is detonated.\nThis way, even if the giant cat comes\nback, he can immediately use the\nexplosive pack to drive it away. If it\nhides in the shadows and observes, the\nexplosion caused by the explosive pack\nhe throws out again will also deter it\nfrom approaching. At the same time, Fong\nYu shouted in the direction of Treasure\nMountain. Alpha, are you all right?\nAfter shouting, Fong Yu estimated that\nthe explosive charge in his hand was\nabout to expire. So, he threw the\nexplosive charge in the direction from\nwhich the black cat's meow came last.\nBoom! A bright flash of light\nilluminated a huge black shadow. It was\nthe black cat. Just as Fongu had\nguessed, it had returned to his\nvicinity, looking for an opportunity to\nattack him. Fortunately, the second\nexplosion scared away the huge predator\nagain. And Fong Yu took the opportunity\nto run towards the cave entrance not far\naway while taking out a third improvised\nexplosive charge. At the same time,\nAlpha finally crawled out of the\ntreasure mountain and followed Fong Yu.\nWhen the man and the dog ran to the cave\nentrance, Fong Yu saw that the rat king\nwas also crawling towards the cave\nentrance from the other side of the\ncorner. After seeing the rat king, Fong\nYu, still furious, kicked the guy in the\nbutt. Damn it, you didn't even tell me\nthere was danger when I saved you. And\nthen you sold me out after I did. Alpha\nglared fiercely at the rat king and\nroared angrily. It had been startled by\nthe giant cat and thought that it and\nits master were going to be doomed. All\nof this was caused by the rat in front\nof it. Just as Alpha was about to teach\nthe rat king a lesson on behalf of its\nmaster, a gust of cold wind blew by, and\nthe man, the dog, and the rat suddenly\nsensed something at the same time. It\nmust be the giant cat attacking again.\nWithout hesitation, Fong Yu threw the\nthird explosive charge in the direction\nfrom which the gust of wind was blowing.\nAs the explosive charge went away, the\ngust of wind quickly moved away. It\nseems that the black cat finally\nunderstood the power of the explosive\ncharge. So, it retreated again as soon\nas it saw Fongu throw the explosive\ncharge. However, what the giant cat\ndidn't know was that Fong Yu threw the\nthird explosive charge in such a hurry\nthat he forgot to light the fuse. Taking\nadvantage of this opportunity, the man,\nthe dog, and the rat quickly scured out\nof the hole and escaped. The opening was\nless than 1 m in diameter, so the giant\ncat probably couldn't get out. They were\nsafe for the time being, but before Fong\nYu could catch his breath, he heard a\nlot of noisy roars coming from the\nopening. Judging from the sound, it was\ndefinitely the dwarf demon from the\ncave. It's likely that the two massive\nexplosions just now attracted the\nattention of the dwarves deep inside the\npalace. Fongu didn't have time to\ncomplain about the rat king anymore, so\nhe quickly ran out of the hole with\nAlpha, and the rat king naturally\nfollowed with a shameless grin. After\ncoming out, Fongu had a sudden idea. He\ntook out 20 pieces of gravel that he had\njust picked up on the way from his\nbackpack and piled them all at the\nentrance of the cave, blocking it\ncompletely. Although this method of\nblocking could not stop the dwarf\ndemons, it could at least delay them for\na while. Fong Yu then led Alpha and the\nRat King back in the direction they had\ncome from. When they passed the\nnarrowest part of the passage, Fong Yu\ngritted his teeth, took out two\nimprovised explosive charges, lit them,\nand blew up the passage. Although it's\nunclear whether this will completely\nblock the dwarf's path to the tunnels,\nit's the only option for now. Before\nlong, Fong Yu and the others returned to\nthe rat king's lair. Looking at the rock\nrats that had been smashed into\nmincemeat by the dwarf demons, a deep\nsadness appeared in the rat king&lt;unk&gt;s\neyes. On the way back, Fong Yu finally\nfigured it out. The elemental crystals\nin the rat king's cave must have been\nstolen from that underground palace.\nWhile the ores were dug up by the rock\nrats in the underground world recently,\nperhaps in order to exchange for more\nroasted meat, the rat king led the rock\nrats to the underground palace, hoping\nto bring back more elemental crystals to\ntrade for roasted meat. The commotion\nwas so great that the giant cat guarding\nthe treasure vault discovered and\ncaptured him. The dead dwarf demon next\nto him was probably the guard\nresponsible for that treasure vault. In\norder to retrieve the lost elemental\ncrystal, he followed the hole in the\nwall and the tracks of rock rats along\nthe way to find this place, intending to\ndestroy the rock rat's nest. As a\nresult, he happened to encounter me, who\ncame to trade with the rat king. The rat\nking, on the other hand, was treated\nlike a toy and captured by the giant cat\nin the underground palace's treasure\nvault. Sigh. This really is a case of\ncause and effect. Your retribution is\nme. Chapter 72. Windrunner's control.\nThrough this trip to the underground\npalace, Fongu realized that he was not\nstrong enough. There were too many\npowerful creatures hidden in this world,\nsuch as the giant black cat in the\nunderground palace. That terrifying\ngiant cat was not only enormous and\nincredibly fast, but it was also\nimpervious to explosives. In fact, it\neven slapped Alpha, who had transformed\naway with a single blow, demonstrating\nthe cat's terrifying power. Fortunately,\nwith the help of the game assistant, he\nlearned that the giant cat was timid by\nnature. So, he used the explosives to\ndrive it away, giving himself time to\nescape. So, just as Fongu guessed, this\nsurvival game often comes with high\nrewards and high risks. Fortunately, he\nwas not blinded by the treasures in the\nvault, and he also had Alpha's early\nwarning system. In addition, he had the\nexplosive pack as a weapon, which\nallowed him to escape this calamity. If\nan ordinary player were to enter that\ntreasure vault, they would most likely\nbe overwhelmed by the dazzling array of\ntreasures and then be ambushed by the\nblack cat while picking up the\ntreasures. They would either become its\nvictims or, like the rat king, be\ncaptured and become its toys. Therefore,\nthis underground palace exploration was\ndefinitely a matter of life and death.\nIt's impossible to go to that\nunderground palace in the short term.\nPutting aside everything else, even if\nthat giant cat wasn't killed by the\nexplosives, it was probably disfigured\nby the explosion and must hate itself to\ndeath. To obtain the treasure inside,\nyou'll have to wait until you're strong\nenough to defeat that giant cat. It's a\npity that I couldn't bring any of the\ntreasures out with me. Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s\nsideigh. At this moment, the rat king\napproached Fong Yu, stretched out its\nfront paws, pulled something out of its\nmouth, and spat it in front of Fong Yu.\nFongu shown the torch on it, and\ndiscovered that the object appeared to\nbe a ring. He squatted down, picked up\nthe ring from the ground, wiped the\ndrool off it, and found that it was\nindeed a blue ring made of an unknown\nmaterial. Wind Walker's Guard Blue. When\nequipped, it can be activated with 10\nmana or 10 spirit points to activate\nWind Walker state, increasing agility by\nthree points for 10 minutes with a 1\nhour cool down and 99 uses. Um, it's\nactually a magic ring that can increase\nagility and speed. This thing is quite\nuseful. With this Windrunner's Guard,\nyou can increase your agility attribute\nby three points at any time. Whether you\nwant to attack or escape, this ring is\nextremely useful and the cost is not\nhigh. So, from a practical standpoint,\nthis Wind Ranger's Guardian is indeed\nworthy of its blue quality, and it's\nalso the first magical item he's\nacquired. After reading the information\non the ring, Fong Yu smiled with\nsatisfaction, glanced at the rat king,\nand said irritably, \"For me?\" The rat\nking nodded, \"To repay me for saving\nyou.\" The rat king nodded again.\n\"Hoofmph! At least you have some\nconscience. For the sake of this ring, I\nwon't hold it against you for selling me\nearlier. So, the man, the dog, and the\nrat continued toward the rat king's\nburrow. After returning to the rat\nking&lt;unk&gt;s burrow, the rock rats soon\nreappeared in the surrounding corners.\nUpon seeing their king, they began to\nsqueal with excitement. Fong Yu clapped\nhis hands, took out 100 portions of\nroasted meat that he had prepared\nbeforehand from his backpack, scattered\nthem in the cave, and finally handed a\npiece to the rat king, and stuffed it\ninto his mouth, saying, \"Let's put the\npast behind us, and our deal will\ncontinue. Is that all right?\" The rat\nking nodded, tears welling in his eyes,\nand began to eat the delicious roasted\nmeat. \"From now on, don't let the rock\nrats go to that dungeon anymore. Just\nfocus on mining and trading with me for\nroasted meat. A little less is fine, but\ndon't provoke those dwarves again. As he\nspoke, Fong Yu pointed to the cave he\nhad come from and said, \"If you find any\ntrace of those dwarfs, run to the mine\non the cliff and look for the ghost you\nsaw last time. Understand?\" The rat king\nnodded as he ate his roasted meat. After\ngiving his instructions, Fong Yu led\nAlpha away from the rat king&lt;unk&gt;s cave\nand back to the surface mine. After Fong\nYu returned to the surface mine, the\nghosts who had been waiting for him\nimmediately surrounded him, asking about\nthe situation in the underground world,\nespecially about the cave dwarfs. \"It's\nnot a big problem,\" Fun Yu explained.\n\"I've already used a makeshift explosive\ncharge to blow up the passage from the\ndwarf's lair to here, and I've also\ninstructed the rat king to come to the\nmine and notify you immediately if it\nfinds any more traces of the dwarfs.\" At\nthis point, Fong Yu took out five simple\nexplosive charges and placed them on the\ntable in the ghost cabin, saying, \"I'm\nleaving you five explosive charges. If\nthe dwarves really come back, you can\nuse these explosive charges to blow up\nthe mine.\" Seeing that the ghosts were\nstill hesitant, Fongu added, \"Actually,\nyou don't have anything to worry about\nnow that you're ghosts. Those dwarfs\ncan't hurt you anymore.\" Upon hearing\nthis, the ghosts immediately realized\nwhat was happening. Yeah, they're all\ndead. Ghosts now. What's there to be\nafraid of? Could it be that the dwarf\ndemon can kill them again? Impossible.\nDwarves are dull-witted creatures who\nonly know how to use crude weapons for\nthe simplest physical attacks. They\ncan't do anything to these ghosts. The\nreason these minor ghosts have always\nfeared the crypt dwarves is because they\nmostly died at the hands of the crypt\ndwarves. The fear they felt before dying\ndeeply affected their thinking. So even\nafter death, they continue to fear the\ncrypt dwarfs. Just like in some\nsupernatural movies, if a person is\nkilled by a criminal, even if he becomes\na ghost after death, he will still be\nafraid of the criminal who killed him.\nThat's the point. But after Fongu\nenlightened them, they got rid of this\npsychological shadow and finally\nrealized that they no longer needed to\nbe afraid of those dwarf demons. Some of\nthe more hot-tempered ghost miners were\neven planning to take up their iron axes\nand head to the underworld to seek\nrevenge on the dwarfs. Don't rush. Don't\nrush. Fongu quickly stopped the few\nminor ghosts who wanted to grab their\nweapons and go down to fight the dwarf\ndemon and said, \"We must avenge this\ngrudge, and I will help you avenge it,\ntoo. But now is not the time. You wait\nfor me to prepare for a while.\" Upon\nhearing that Fong Yu also wanted to\navenge them, the ghost's admiration for\nhim increased even further. What they\ndidn't know was that Fong Yu was helping\nthem get revenge, but more importantly,\nhe had his eye on the treasures in the\nunderground palace. Those treasures\nfilled the entire playground. He may not\nbe interested in power and status, but\nhe is very interested in money. Because\nof money, he can live a comfortable life\nwhere he can have whatever he wants,\nwhich is the dream of any lazy bum. Now\nthat's great with Steve and his 10\nghosts who are immune to physical damage\nas helpers. Dealing with those crypt\ndwarves should be much easier. However,\nwe still need to prepare some handy\nweapons for the ghosts. We can't really\nlet them carry iron pickaxes to fight\nthe dwarves, can we? That would be far\ntoo shabby. So Fongu decided to go back\nand make weapons for the ghosts. Chapter\n73. Madwolves and Barbarians. After\nsaying goodbye to the ghosts, Funu led\nAlpha through the woods to head back,\nthinking he should hurry back to the\nhouse to take a shower because every\ntime he went into the mine, he and his\ndog would get covered in dust. The dog\nwas fine. With just a gentle shake, all\nthe dust off its body would fall off.\nBut Fongu didn't have that ability.\nMoreover, when the explosives were used\nto blow up the dwarf, a lot of the\ndwarf's flesh fragments and even\ninternal organs fell on him. At the\ntime, the light was dim underground and\nthe situation was urgent. So, Fong Yu\ndidn't notice. Only now that he has come\nout of the mine did he realize how dirty\nhe was. Just a few steps after Fong Yu\nand Alpha started walking home, Alpha\nalertly raised its head and looked in a\ncertain direction from the woods. What's\ngoing on? Is there danger? Fongu stopped\nand asked. Alpha shook his head and\nactually walked in that direction.\nSeeing this, Fongu assumed that Alpha\nhad discovered some valuable prey. So,\nhe immediately took out the hornb from\nhis backpack, drew an arrow, and knocked\nit on the bowring, and followed closely\nbehind Alpha, cautiously moving in the\ndirection Alpha indicated. However,\nafter following the dog through a\nthicket, Fongu witnessed a scene that\nsurprised him. A tall, thin man with a\nthuggish look was seen choking a\ndisheveled woman by the neck, pinning\nher against the trunk of a large tree.\nIn his other hand, he held a dagger to\nthe woman's neck, seemingly about to\ncommit a crime. The tall, thin man's\nname was Wu Fon Lang. He was a social\noutcast known as a street hustler in\nnortheastern dialect and a gangster in\nHong Kong dialect. Wu Fon Lang was a\nruthless man. He had taught himself a\nfew fighting and grappling techniques.\nSo, he was extremely vicious when he\nfought. When he went crazy, he was\nreckless and didn't care about his life.\nSo people who knew him gave him the\nnickname Madwolf. For most people,\nleaving the hustle and bustle of modern\ncity life to survive in a perilous\nsurvival game would be incredibly\ndifficult. But for Madwolf, entering\nthis survival world was like a fish in\nwater. In this lawless world, he could\nact with impunity and do whatever he\npleased. Since entering this world,\nMadwolf has killed nine players and\nrobbed them of their supplies. In Mad\nWolf's view, the little supplies he\npainstakingly gathered by cutting down\ntrees were nowhere near as quick as\nkilling and robbing. Those fools who\nonly know how to bury themselves in hard\nwork are like lambs in a sheepfold who\nonly know how to eat grass. Waiting for\nhim, the top predator, to slowly hunt\nthem down. So, except for those three\ndays in winter, Madwolf spends almost\nevery day near the spawn point looking\nfor other players, or rather his prey.\nWhen encountering other players, Mad\nWolf will first pretend to be\nenthusiastic and strike up a\nconversation and may even offer some\nfood to share. Then, when the other\nplayer is off guard, he will launch a\nsneak attack, kill the other player, and\nplunder their supplies. Simple,\nstraightforward, and extremely\nefficient. Of course, this only applies\nto male players and female players who\nare not good-looking. Yesterday, he\nencountered a very beautiful female\nplayer. After gaining her trust through\nsweet talk, Mad Wolf used extremely\ncruel methods to rape and then kill her.\nA famous philosopher once said, \"The\nevil in human nature is like a wild\nbeast locked in a cage. Morality and\nconscience are the materials used to\nbuild the cage, while the law is the\nshackle that locks it up.\" At this\nmoment, the beast within Wu Fong Lang,\nrepresenting the ugly side of human\nnature, had completely broken free of\nits cage, even devouring the last trace\nof his humanity and transforming him\ninto a mad wolf in human skin. Having\ntasted the sweetness of the game,\nMadwolf went out hunting as usual today.\nIn fact, he has begun to lose interest\nin male players and is preparing to\nspecifically hunt down female players\nwho are somewhat attractive. So, it took\nhim most of the day to finally pinpoint\nthe female player in front of him, who\nseemed to be somewhat attractive. In\nfact, he had already succeeded 2 hours\nearlier. The woman in front of him was\nso frightened when she saw him pull out\nthe knife that she collapsed to the\nground and let him do whatever he\nwanted. In fact, in order to survive,\nthe woman deliberately tried to please\nthe mad wolf, which the madwolf\nthoroughly enjoyed. Just as Mad Wolf\nfinished enjoying the woman's body and\nwas about to kill her, the woman said\nshe knew of a treasure cave. So Madwolf\ndecided not to kill her yet and let her\nlead him to find the treasure cave.\nHowever, after wandering around the\nwoods with this woman for a long time,\nMadolf finally realized that this woman\nwas probably deceiving him to save her\nown life and to buy time to find an\nopportunity to escape. So, the impatient\nwolf grabbed the woman by the neck and\nslammed her against the tree trunk. And\nthis was exactly what Fongu saw as he\nwalked through the bushes. I advise you\nto be smart and stop beating around the\nbush. Tell me the location of the\ntreasure cave and I might let you go\nbecause you served me so well before.\nOtherwise, Mad Wolf threatened the\nfemale player whose neck he was choking.\nAs he spoke, Mad Wolf began to slide the\ndagger down his hand, aiming for the\nwoman's clothes at her chest. Otherwise,\nI'll rip your heart out and shove it\ninto your mouth. As the Mad Wolf's knife\nsliced open the woman's collar and moved\ntowards her heart, her defenses finally\ncrumbled. She cried, \"I'll tell you.\nI'll tell you where the treasure cave\nis. Please don't hurt me anymore.\"\nSeeing that the woman had given in,\nMadwolf sneered and sheathed his knife,\nsaying, \"That's more like it. If you had\ntold me earlier, you wouldn't have had\nto suffer like this. So, where exactly\nis the treasure cave?\" The woman raised\nher hand, sobbing, and pointed in a\ndirection. But when she looked in the\ndirection she was pointing, she suddenly\nlet out a scream. Oh. The scream\nstartled Mad Wolf, who enraged raised\nhis hand and slapped the woman across\nthe face, cursing, \"You son of a\nWhat are you yelling about? You scared\nthe hell out of me.\" Ignoring the pain\nin her cheek, the woman continued\npointing in that direction, screaming in\nterror, \"Strange! Strange monster!\"\nSeeing that the woman's terrified\nexpression didn't seem fake, Madwolf\nturned his head and looked in the\ndirection she was pointing. Immediately,\nMad Wolf saw a strange man wearing\nanimal skin armor covered in blood and\nexuding murderous aura standing by the\nbushes not far away, and he seemed to be\nholding a long bow in his hand. Could\nthey be native barbarians of this world?\nMoreover, beside that barbarian was a\nvicious dog with glowing red eyes and\nbared fangs. Chapter 74. The barbarian\nwith magic. Fu wasn't really one to\nmeddle in other people's business, but\nit didn't seem right to just watch a\nvulnerable woman being threatened with a\ndagger by a man and then turn away.\nAlthough he didn't have much of a\nconscience, he still had some. So,\nshould we go and help that woman? Just\nas Fong Yu was hesitating, the woman\nunexpectedly discovered him. This led\nthe man with the dagger to notice him as\nwell. That's awkward. At that moment,\nthe man with the dagger turned around\nwith a fierce expression and gave Fong\nYu a cruel smile. Judging from the looks\nof it, this thuggish man is probably\nabout to make a move against Fong Yu.\nFong Yu felt a slight unease upon seeing\nthis scene. Not only did the other party\nshow no fear upon seeing a stranger who\nhad suddenly appeared, but they were\neven ready to attack him right away.\nBased on this, we can infer that the\nother party must be very capable and may\nhave already completed a career change.\nThey should not be underestimated. This\nis why Fong Yu didn't immediately step\nin to help because he wasn't sure of the\nother party's strength. However,\nalthough Fong Yu was very careful, Alpha\nbeside him had already roared and\ncharged towards the man. In Alpha's\nview, if it could help its master kill\nthis man, play the hero, and save the\ndamsel in distress, and then let its\nmaster bring that woman home so she\ncould warm the master's bed, its master\nwould be very happy. The owner will be\nhappy and will definitely cook lots of\ndelicious food for it. So, this was a\nhuge profit. Seeing Alpha already\ncharging forward, Fong Yu swallowed back\nthe words he wanted to say to stop it.\nFine, fine. Since the fight has already\nstarted, let it be. Anyway, it's wrong\nfor this man to bully a woman. So, I'll\nreluctantly play the role of a chivalous\nknight who helps those in need. So, Fong\nYu also knocked an arrow and began\naiming at the man. At this moment, Alpha\nwas already engaged in a battle of wits\nwith Madwolf. It used its agile\nmovements to dodge the daggers in\nMadwolf's hands, while Madwolf also\nshowed a calmer state and excellent\ncombat talent than the average person.\nEvery time Alpha tried to extend its\nclaws to scratch Madwolf, Madwolf could\nnimly parry with its dagger,\ndemonstrating the huge difference\nbetween having a weapon and not having\none. Although Alpha is slightly faster\nthan Mad Wolf, Madwolf's dagger always\nmanages to repel its attacks. This guy\nis definitely not an ordinary person.\nFong Yu carefully observed the man's\nmovements and expressions and made an\nassessment of him in his mind. Judging\nfrom his skills, he has definitely been\ntrained and his mental fortitude is also\nexcellent. He doesn't show a trace of\npanic and even seems a little excited.\nFongu narrowed his eyes, locked his aim\non the man, and then shot the first\narrow. Whoosh! The arrow grazed the\nman's back and struck the tree trunk\nbehind him. The first arrow missed.\nMadwolf also noticed the arrows that\nbrushed past him, but he was held back\nby Alpha and could not hide behind the\ntree. At this moment, Fongu had already\ntaken out a second arrow from the\nquiver. After aiming again, the arrow\nsuccessfully hit the man's left arm, but\nwas deflected by the iron gauntlet on\nhis arm. Damn it, this bow and arrow do\nso little damage. Funu cursed loudly,\nput away his bow and arrows, took out\nhis ax, and prepared to switch to melee\ncombat. However, close combat is quite\nrisky. So, Fong Yu began to chant a\nspell in a low voice, preparing to give\nhimself a magic buff first. Just then,\nthe man suddenly produced a 2 m long\niron spear and shouted, \"To thrust!\"\nSuddenly, a cold light flashed in the\niron spear in the man's hand, and the\ntip of the spear thrust fiercely towards\nthe unsuspecting Alpha. Madwolf had\nactually been hiding his strength all\nalong. After he intercepted and killed a\nmale player the day before yesterday, he\nfound the night job change skill book,\nFong Thrust, in the male player's\nbackpack and had already changed his job\nto an apprentice knight. Madwolf hadn't\nplanned to use his trump card so easily\nbecause in his view, killing a dog\nwouldn't require so much effort. But\nafter dealing with the stray dog in\nfront of him for a while, he found that\nthe stray dog with red eyes had abnormal\nspeed and strength and even seemed to\nhave a high level of intelligence as it\nwas able to accurately predict his\nactions. In fact, he was finding it\nincreasingly difficult to withstand the\nonslaught of this stray dog. Therefore,\nwith no other choice, Mad Wolf had to\ntake out his iron spear from his\nbackpack when the mongrel pounced on\nhim. Taking advantage of the mongrel's\ninability to dodge while its body was in\nmidair, Madwolf used his knight skill,\nFong Thrust. However, to Mad Wolf's\nsurprise, even though his move was a\nsurprise attack made on the spot, the\nMongrel was still able to forcefully\ntwist its body in midair and dodge his\nfatal strike. Even so, Madwolf still\nmanaged to use his skill to throw the\nstray dog away by slapping the gun from\nthe side. Thump! The dog's body crashed\ninto a tree trunk not far away, letting\nout a mournful yelp before falling to\nthe ground. Watching the troublesome dog\nbeing sent flying by his own shot,\nMadwolf twirled his gun with\nsatisfaction, then turned to look at the\ndog's owner, a barbarian dressed in\nleather and covered in blood. Seeing the\niron spear wielded with such force by\nthe man, Fong Yu knew that this was\ndefinitely not something an ordinary\nperson could do. Judging from the shout\nof tooth thrust he had just made, he\nmust have also obtained some kind of\nspear combat skill, he might even have\nalready acquired a melee warrior class.\nTherefore, his close combat ability must\nbe superior to mine. Moreover, my close\ncombat weapon is just an iron axe, while\nthe other party's weapon is a long\nspear. As the saying goes, an inch\nlonger, an inch stronger. I who have no\nclose combat skills and am only holding\nan iron axe am definitely no match for\nthis man who is holding a long spear and\nhas close combat skills. So how should\nwe deal with this? Just as Fong Yu was\npondering a solution and continuing to\nbuff himself, Mad Wolf charged towards\nhim with his iron spear. Judging from\nhis fierce stance, he seemed poised to\nstab Fongu right through. Mad Wolf\ncharged at Fong Yu with his spear with\nease and confidence because in his eyes\nthis guy was just a native barbarian and\na stupid one at that who just stood\nthere talking to himself. So what was\nthere to be afraid of? He refused to\nbelieve that the barbarians axe could be\nlonger than his spear. Or perhaps this\nbarbarian can cast a spell. Moreover, he\nstill has enough stamina to unleash\nseveral more fong thrusts. So killing\nthis native who's been standing there\ndumbfounded shouldn't be a problem.\nHowever, the next second, Mad Wolf saw\ntwo kinds of light emanating from the\nnative. Crimson fire runes were engraved\non the iron axe, giving the weapon a 10%\nchance to trigger a fire splash effect\nwhen attacking, lasting for 10 minutes.\nA cyan aura of wind emanated from the\nring on Fong Yu's finger, granting him\nthe Windalker status and agility plus\nthree. Madwolf, holding a long spear,\nstopped in his tracks and stared into\nthought at the two-colored light\nemanating from the native. \"Could this\nreally be magic?\" Madwolf thought with a\nsense of surprise and doubt. Chapter 75.\nKilling the Mad Wolf unlocks the honor\npoint system. Looking at Fong Yu, who\nwas radiating colorful light, Madwolf\nwas also filled with doubt. He began to\nrealize that the natives in front of him\nmight not be just simple barbarians.\nAlthough Mad Wolf was crazy, he wasn't\nstupid. He wondered if he had\nencountered the legendary guy who was\npretending to be weak while actually\nbeing strong. But things have come to\nthis point. The battle has begun, and\nthere is no turning back. So, Mad Wolf\ngritted his teeth and charged at Fong Yu\nagain with his spear. At this moment,\nFong Yu, who had activated Windrunner\nmode, received a three-point increase in\nboth physical and mental agility.\nAlthough it may not seem like much, his\noriginal agility was only 5.52. So the\nthree-point increase was equivalent to\nmore than 50% increase in agility.\nTherefore, in his eyes, Mad Wolf's\nmovements appeared much slower than\nbefore. At least it's slow enough that I\ncan avoid it. So Fongu sidestepped the\nspear that Madwolf thrust at his chest.\nAnd in turn, he raised his iron axe and\nchopped at Madwolf's spear wielding\nhand. Mad Wolf saw the ax blade coming\ntowards him. Took a half step back and\nslightly pulled his forearm back to\ndodge Fong Yu's ax blade, but the ax\nblade still struck his spear handle.\nBite with a clang of metal on metal.\nSparks flew from the ax blade toward Mad\nWolf by inertia. The fire rune splash\neffect was triggered on the very first\nstrike. A large number of sparks\nsplashed onto Madwolf at close range,\nforcing him to retreat hastily. Fong Yu\ntook this opportunity to swing his ax at\nMadwolf again. Just as Fong Yu lunged\nforward, Madwolf instinctively sensed\ndanger, roared, and unleashed his trump\ncard, Shield of Thorns. With Mad Wolf's\nfurious roar, a burst of energy erupted\nfrom his body, and he began to wildly\nswing his spear, forming an impenetrable\ndefensive net. Although it appears to be\na defensive formation, this defensive\nnetwork is actually formed by the rapid\nmovement of spear tips. Anyone that\ncrashes into it will be riddled with\nholes by the high-speed moving spear\ntips. Seeing this, Fongu stopped his\nattack and even took a few steps back.\nAnyone with eyes could see that this\ndefensive skill called shield of thorns\ncouldn't last long since constantly\nswinging a spear was a very tiring\nthing. Therefore, after a moment's\nthought, Fongu came up with a new idea.\nI wonder if your shield of thorns can\nwithstand my fireball. At this moment,\nMad Wolf was planning to end thorn\nshield and then find a chance to escape.\nBecause he realized that he was no match\nfor this strange barbarian. Based on the\nprinciple of as long as the green hills\nremain, there will always be firewood to\nburn, he wanted to run away. But as soon\nas Mad Wolf finished his thorn shield\ndefense, he saw the native chant again.\nAnd then a ball of orange red fire\nappeared in the native's hand.\nImmediately afterwards, the native\nraised the fireball in his hand and\nhurled it at the mad wolf. Holy\nSeeing the fireball shooting towards him\nfrom midair, Madwolf cursed and quickly\ndodged behind a tree trunk. Now he was\n100% certain that the other party was a\nmage. What the hell? Are you crazy? Why\nwould a barbarian know magic? What Mad\nWolf didn't expect was that the fireball\nthat was heading towards him could\nactually curve. After flying over the\ntree trunk, the fireball quickly changed\ndirection and slammed into the chest of\nthe unsuspecting Madwolf. The scorching\nflames instantly burned through his thin\nlinen clothes. Huh. Madwolf let out a\nscream and collapsed to the ground. The\nsearing pain from the flames made him\nwrithe on the ground. He threw away his\nspear and tried to extinguish the flames\non his chest by rolling. But before he\ncould put them out, he saw a second\nfireball flying towards him. Boom!\nMadwolf's head was struck by flames, and\norange flames instantly clung to his\nface and burned. Madwolf howled and\ntried to extinguish the flames on his\nface with his hands. But how could\nflames formed by fire elements be\nextinguished by hand? A few breaths\nlater, scorched by the flames on his\nhead and chest, Mad Wolf finally\ncollapsed to the ground, twitched\nslightly a few times, and then fell\nsilent. To prevent the man from figning\ndeath, Fongu took out his bow and arrow,\nand shot two more arrows at the corpse.\nAfter confirming that the man was\ncompletely dead, he picked up his iron\nax and went to the man's corpse. Looking\nat the man whose head had been burned\nbeyond recognition, he waved his hand to\nextinguish the flames on the man's body.\nHuh? I thought you were so great, but\nyou have the nerve to bully women like\nthis. Fongu spat on the corpse and said,\n\"You deserve to die.\" Although he spoke\nthe toughest words, his slightly\ntrembling hands and somewhat stiff steps\nbetrayed the unease Fongu felt after his\nfirst murder. This unease wasn't due to\nany psychological burden, but rather an\nuncontrollable tremor caused by a surge\nof adrenaline. After several deep\nbreaths, Funu gradually managed to\nsuppress the tremor. At this moment,\nFongu noticed the prompt given by the\ngame assistant. You have killed a\nplayer, unlocking the honor system. You\nkilled player Wu Fong Lang, ID 4516,\ngaining 10 honor points. Under normal\ncircumstances, each player kill grants\none honor point. If the killed player\nalready has honor points, the killer\ngains all of the killed players honor\npoints plus one. Upon seeing this, Funyu\ngasped. He gained 10 honor points, which\nmeans this guy has already killed nine\npeople. Damn, I can't believe I\naccidentally killed a serial killer. At\nthis point, the last bit of discomfort\nFongu felt about killing had completely\ndisappeared. Immediately, Fongu went\nstraight to the tree where Alpha had\nfallen and checked Alpha's injuries.\nAfter examining Alpha, and finding that\nit was not seriously hurt, he breathed a\nsigh of relief. At this moment, the game\nassistant popped up another\nnotification. You can participate in a\nsystem lottery once you accumulate 10\nhonor points. Would you like to draw\nnow? Huh? A system lottery? There's\nactually such a benefit. Of course,\nwe'll draw it now. Please select the\ncategory of items you wish to draw.\nCurrently, there are three categories\navailable. One, pets. Two, supplies.\nThree, job skills. As for pets, Fu\nalready has a little spider named Sakura\nat home. And Alpha is always by his\nside. Once Ryan can move during the day,\nhe can have another companion, so he\ndoesn't need pets for the time being. As\nfor supplies, to be honest, he already\nhas over 100,000 supplies, plus the\nghosts mining for him and the rat king\ntrading with him. So, he basically\ndoesn't have to worry. That leaves only\nitems related to class skills. He\ncurrently only has the classes of mage\nand butcher. So, it would be great if he\ncould get a new class. I'll choose items\nrelated to professional skills, Fu\ndecided. The prize category has been\ndetermined. Professional skills. The\ndraw will now begin. Chapter 76. Bribing\nthe evil gods roulette. The prize\ncategory has been determined.\nProfessional skills. The draw will now\nbegin. As the game assistant subtitles\ndisappeared, the air in front of Fong Yu\ndistorted strangely. Then a huge dark\ncrack appeared and a roulette wheel\nabout 2 m tall jumped out from the\ncrack. Fongu noticed that there was\nactually a large sly blackish purple\neyeball in the center of the roulette\nwheel. The pointer below the turntable\nis actually a thick, large, and long\npurple tentacle that is constantly\ntwisting. Fongu took a step back and\nfinally saw the entire turntable. The\nbase of the turntable was actually a\nmonster with its entire body resembling\nan octopus, and the monster's head\nseemed to be behind the turntable. The\nentire circular turntable was like a\nmask, blocking the monster's true\nappearance, leaving only the large round\nblackish purple eyeball in the center.\nWow, this turntable has a really unique\ndesign. Despite his complaints, Fongu\nwasn't worried about the octopus-like\nlottery will hurting him since it was a\nsystem product. So, he decided to see\nwhat rewards were on the wheel. But\nbefore he could even see the names of\nthe prizes, the wheel started spinning\nwildly. Fong Yu was speechless at the\nway the turntable rotated. It was\nactually pushed by more than a dozen\ntentacles on the base. Is this lottery\nwill a joke? It's so ugly. I told you to\nread more books, but you insisted on\nreading pornographic books. You didn't\neven recognize the Cthulhu themed\ncreatures. After being reminded by the\ngame assistant, Fongu was startled and\nlooking at the roulette wheel again,\nfinally realized what it was. Isn't this\njust like those tentacle monsters from\ndark mythology? Immediately, goosebumps\nrose all over Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s body. As far\nas he knew, Cthulhu was an evil god,\nsymbolizing madness, destruction, and\nmisfortune. Humans who came into contact\nwith him would have their minds\ncorrupted by his chaotic whispers and\nwould not have a good end. Perhaps\nsensing Fong Yu's fear, the game\nassistant explained again. Don't worry,\nthe game system controls it, so it won't\nhave any effect on you. Fongu breathed a\nsigh of relief upon seeing the game\nassistance notification. Soon, the\nspinning wheel began to slow down, and\nFongu gradually saw that the area on the\nspinning wheel was divided into many\nsquares of different sizes. The largest\nsquares were gray, followed by white\nsquares, and the smallest squares were\nred, occupying only about the thickness\nof a finger. Looking at the different\nsizes and colors of the grids, Fongu\nsuddenly realized that the colors\nrepresented the quality of the items.\nGray represents decay, white represents\ncommon, green represents fine, blue\nrepresents rare, yellow represents top\nquality, purple represents epic, orange\nrepresents legendary, and red represents\ndivine artifact. Upon recalling the\nitem's grade, Funu immediately became\nexcited. In other words, you have a\nchance to draw a powerful artifact, that\nis the area in red. Funu then focused\nhis gaze intently on the red area on the\nturntable, praying that the red area\nwould eventually stop at the position of\nthe tentacle pointer. At this moment,\nthe game assistant gave Fongu another\nprompt. If prayer worked, you wouldn't\nhave been brought into this world in the\nfirst place, you fool. Think about it\ncarefully. What's the key to this\nroulette wheel? What's the key to the\nturntable? Fongu frowned and looked at\nthe turntable again. When he saw the sly\neyeball in the center of the turntable,\nhe suddenly understood. By the way, this\nturntable is movable and it was\nconscious. So, is it possible to try\ncommunicating with them? Or perhaps a\nbribe? At this moment, the spinning\nwheel was slowing down. So, Fong Yu\nimmediately leaned close to the wheel\nand said to the eyeball in the center,\n\"Could you help me stop the red area of\nthe wheel at the position of the\npointer?\" Upon hearing this, the big\neyeball rolled slightly, and then the\ntentacle pointer stood up and beckoned\nto Fong Yu. Then a gaping hole full of\nfangs appeared at the tip of the\npointer. Judging from her expression,\n\"She definitely wants something from me.\nThat's pretty direct, but what should we\ngive it?\" Fongu rummaged through his\nbackpack, took out a piece of roasted\nmeat, and handed it to the tentacle. The\ntentacle swallowed the meat hole, and\nthen continued to open its mouth full of\nfangs. \"One isn't enough? Then let's\ncontinue. So Fong Yu took out a second\npiece of roasted meat. The third piece.\nThe 15th piece. Holy crap. Are you a\npig? You're still not full after 15\nyuan. Fongu was furious. However, the\ntentacles on the turntable pointed to\nthe smallest red area. And then the\neyeball in the center of the turntable\ngave Fongu a look that said, \"You'd\nbetter figure it out yourself. Its\nmeaning is simple. Want the red\nartifact? Feed me first. The roasted\nmeat had been fed, but the tentacles\nwere still there with their mouths open,\nwaiting to be fed again. Fongu glanced\nat the spinning wheel that was about to\nstop, gritted his teeth, and took out\nthe elemental crystal from his backpack,\nasking, \"Can you eat this?\" The eyeball\non the turntable glanced at the\nelemental crystal in Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s hand\nand then shook its tentacle. \"Only\nmeat?\" The tentacle nodded. \"Damn it, I\nonly brought this little bit of meat\nwith me when I went out. I saved the 100\npieces of roasted meat for the rat king.\nWhere am I going to get any more meat\nfor it? And the spinning wheel is about\nto stop. It seems too late to send alpha\nhunting now. Just as Fong Yu was\nscratching his head in frustration,\nsuddenly the eyeball on the turntable\nglanced at Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s side and then\npointed with its tentacle. Fong Yu\nturned his head in the direction of the\nfinger and realized that the finger was\nactually the corpse of the man he had\nkilled with a fireball. Holy crap, you\neat this stuff, too. Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s eyes\nwidened. The tentacles nodded\nrepeatedly, looking quite excited,\nseemingly very interested in the corpse.\nAfter hesitating for a moment, Fong Yu\nstill picked up the corpse from the\nground, took off the backpack from his\nbody, and handed the corpse to the\ntentacles on the turntable. Let's just\nconsider it a way to make use of waste.\nWhoosh! A strange sound of stretching of\nthe biological skin rang out, and the\ntip of the tentacle, which was\noriginally only as thick as an arm,\nsuddenly opened into a gaping m and\nswallowed the corpse that Fong Yu was\nholding whole. Immediately, Fongu saw\nthe corpse being swallowed by the\ntentacles, then slowly sliding down the\ntentacles into the turntable and\ndisappearing. However, the originally\nflat turntable seemed to have become\nbloated after the corpse was placed\ninside. Belch! The tentacle let out a\nlong burp, and the eye in the center of\nthe turntable narrowed slightly,\nseemingly enjoying its feast. At that\nmoment, the turntable finally stopped,\nand the tentacle pointer was still a\nlittle short of the smallest red square.\n\"Hey, hey, hey, almost there,\" Fongu\nreminded him. Upon hearing this, the\neyeball on the turntable glanced in the\ndirection of the tentacle, and the\ntentacle pointer finally moved slowly to\nthe smallest red square and stopped,\njust as Funy had wished. He he. A low,\neerie laugh that sent chills down one's\nspine came from the turntable, which\nthen emitted a strange red light and\nbegan to vibrate. What are they trying\nto do? Are they going to explode? Fun\ntook two steps back. The tentacle\npointer began to tremble as if something\nwas emanating from the turntable through\nits tentacle body. Finally, the mouth\nfull of fangs at the tip of the tentacle\nsuddenly opened wide. Vomit. A puddle of\nsomething covered in an unknown slime\nwas spat into Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s arms by the\ntentacle. Chapter 77. Divine artifact.\nThe book of evil gods. Fong Yu forced\nhimself to throw away the disgusting\nslimy object he was holding. He tried to\nwipe off the slime with his gloved hand.\nAnd upon closer inspection, it seemed to\nbe a book. That's right. This is a book\nabout 10 cm thick, about the size of an\nA4 sheet of paper. The cover is made of\na piece of dark purple leather, which\nfeels soft to the touch, like it's\nalive. There's also a slightly raised\nthing in the center of the cover, but I\ndon't know what it is. However, the next\nsecond, the bulge suddenly split open,\nrevealing a purple eyeball. This eyeball\nlooked around quickly before locking\nonto Fong Yu in front of it. And then,\nwow. The book opened by itself. And what\nshocked Fong Yu even more was that\ninside the book were not papers and\nwords, but a mouthful of sharp fangs and\na thick, long, bright red tongue. This\nis clearly a monster with a big mouth\nthat looks like a book. The book of the\nevil god. Read. This is an ancient magic\nbook corrupted by an evil god of the\nabyss. It contains countless treasures\nrelated to magic. But to obtain the\ntreasures within, you need to feed it.\nWow. The strange book in his hand began\nto twist wildly, its mouth open as if it\nwanted to tear Fong Yu, who was holding\nit, so frightened that Fong Yu threw the\neerie book of evil gods to the ground.\nEven so, the magic book still hopped and\ncrawled toward Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s legs. Holy\ncrap. Fongu took a step back, then\nraised his ax and swung it at the\nattacker. With a duong sound, the sharp\niron axe struck the seemingly soft book,\nbut it bounced back. The strange book\nwas completely unharmed. Still, with its\nmouth open and tongue sticking out,\ntrying to bite Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s thigh,\n\"What the hell is this thing?\" Fongu\nturned his head and glared at the\nlottery wheel next to him and said\nangrily, \"You're telling me this thing\nis a divine artifact?\" However, the\nlottery wheel emitted a strange laugh,\ntwisted its bloated body, and slowly\ndisappeared into the air. He ran away.\nThat guy actually ran away while dodging\nthe strange book on the ground. Fong Yu\ncursed the ancestors of the lottery\nwheel. He felt like he'd been scammed. I\ndrew a completely useless book that\nkeeps chasing and biting me. This has\nreally screwed me over. Just then, Alpha\nsuddenly emerged from the bushes beside\nhim, a pheasant in its mouth, and ran to\nFong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s side. Woof! Alpha placed\nthe pheasant at Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s feet, and\ncalled out to him. Seeing this, Fong Yu\nunderstood Alpha's meaning, picked up\nthe pheasant on the ground, and threw it\nat the strange book. \"Wow!\" The strange\nbook opened its huge mouth, caught the\npheasant in one gulp, and began to chew.\nAfter a flurry of feathers, the strange\nbook swallowed the feeasant completely\ninto its pages and finally quieted down,\ntransforming back into an ordinary\nparchment book. That's it. Fongu raised\nan eyebrow slightly. As if in response\nto Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s words, the strange book\nsuddenly trembled and then hit it spat\nout a blue crystal and Fong Yu took a\ncloser look. Isn't this just a water\nelement crystal? Can you trade a\npheasant for an elemental crystal? If\nyou were to use the butcher's skill to\nbreak down a pheasant, you'd get about\nthree pieces of meat plus some chicken\nwings, inards, feathers, and other odds\nand ends, which would be worth a maximum\nof five pieces of meat. Five pieces of\nmeat would be worth about 100 wood,\nwhile one elemental crystal would be\nworth 500 wood. So, that's a 5x profit\nmargin. That's acceptable. But I don't\nneed elemental crystals anymore. Aren't\nyou a skill related item? Can't you give\nme some skill books or something? If\nnot, even a magic ring or a magic hat\nwould be nice. At that moment, Alpha\nsuddenly ran to the strange book and\nhooked a ribbon on the side of the book\nwith its claws. One end of the ribbon\nhad a six-pointed star badge, which\ncorresponded to a six-pointed star slot\non the cover of the strange book. After\nAlpha inserted the six-pointed star\nemblem into the slot with its claws, the\nstrange book finally turned into a\ncompletely black magic book and stopped\nmoving. Seeing how skillfully the dog\noperated the book, Fong Yu asked\ncuriously, \"Do you recognize this\nstrange book?\" Alpha nodded, \"Woof!\nWoof! Woof! Sigh! I can't understand\nyou. Let Valentina translate for you\nwhen we get back.\" Fong Yu carefully\npicked up the strange book from the\nground, trying to put it in his\nbackpack, but the system indicated that\nit couldn't be put in. The book of evil\ngods possesses a life of its own and\ncannot be added to the inventory system.\nLeft with no other option, Fongu put\naway the iron axe and carrying the\nstrange book, prepared to head back.\nWait, did I forget something? Fongu\nscratched his head, tilted his head, and\nlooked around. He then noticed that the\nbackpack of the man he had killed was\nstill on the ground. In addition, there\nwas the iron spear that the man had\nused, which was about 2 m long, and a\ndagger. Funu put the spear and dagger\ndirectly into his backpack and then\npicked up the backpack on the ground to\nexamine it. Intermediate backpack. Berry\n16, roasted rabbit meat three wood 85\ngravel 30 iron ingots six torches two\nflint and steel one faceless man mask\ngreen backpack 81 12ths that's it you\nkilled nine people and this is all you\nhave was disappointed but then he\nthought that even if the other person\nhad supplies it was impossible for them\nto carry them all with them most of them\nwere probably left at home so it was\nunderstandable that they only had so few\nthings in their backpack. Fongu didn't\ncare about the food, wood, or gravel.\nInstead, he took out the faceless mask\nand started studying it because the\nthing's name was green and it was a\nhighquality piece of equipment. Upon\nreceiving it, Fong Yu discovered that it\nwas a soft silicone-like mask, but its\ntexture was very similar to real skin,\nand it was very thin and light. Faceless\nmask, green, all men must die. All men\nmust serve. The user can disguise their\nface as any target they kill. Limited to\nhumans and demihumans. Cool down one\nday. Upgradeable. Upgrade condition.\nKill 10 people to upgrade to blue grade.\nCool down reduced to 1 hour. Holy crap.\nA mask used for disguise. Fongu's eyes\nwidened. This is an essential item for\nmurder, robbery, home life, and travel.\nWith this mask, he has an extra means to\nconceal his identity. Although he can't\nuse it now, he believes he will\ndefinitely have the opportunity to use\nit in the future. It's a pity that I can\nonly disguise myself as a human or a\ndemihuman. If I could disguise myself as\nanother race, like the dwarf demons of\nthe underground world, I could enter the\nunderground palace and plunder the\ntreasures without lifting a finger.\nHowever, Fong Yu also knew that this\nfaceless mask was only a green grade\nitem after all, and it was already quite\ngood to have this effect. to ask for\nmore would be a bit excessive because\nthe game system doesn't allow backpacks\nto be nested inside each other. Funu had\nto carry the extra backpack himself. So\nwith the book of evil god in one hand\nand the backpack in the other, he\nprepared to walk back with Alpha.\nChapter 78. Digging and digging in the\nlittle garden. Funu had only taken a few\nsteps when he realized he had overlooked\nsomething again. He looked around and\nthen remembered, \"Huh? Where did that\nwoman under the tree go? Could it be\nthat he secretly slipped away while I\nwas fighting with Wuong? Isn't that a\nbit unfair? But on second thought, it's\nunderstandable that the woman, having\nfinally escaped the clutches of the\nthugs, would instinctively try to get as\nfar away as possible. Anyway, Fong Yu\ndidn't expect the woman to repay him in\nany way. In fact, strictly speaking, he\ndidn't fight Wuon Lang with the\nintention of saving a woman, so he\ndidn't care. Thinking about it\ncarefully, this is actually quite good.\nIf that woman were still here, begging\nfor my help or even clinging to me, that\nwould be a real problem. Hey, they're\ngone. So be it. No worries, Alpha. Let's\ngo home, too. Soon, Fongu returned to\nthe manor with the strange book and\nAlpha. As soon as he entered the\ncourtyard, he saw that many fruits and\nvegetables in the fields seemed to be\nripe. After careful consideration, it\nseemed that today was the last day of\nsummer, and there should indeed be a lot\nof fruits and vegetables ripening. So,\nFongu went closer to take a look and saw\ngolden pumpkins, deep purple eggplants,\nfist-sized green peppers, and a lush\nwheat field. Haha, finally, the wheat\nI've been waiting for is finally ripe.\nAnd green peppers, eggplants, big\npumpkins. Tonight I'm having stir-fried\ngreen peppers with shredded pork and\neggplant with minced pork. So Fong Yu\nquickly put the Book of Evil Gods back\ninto the cabin, then took a shower in\nthe bathroom, changed into a linen\noutfit, and then hummed a little tune as\nhe went into the farmland to pick out\nhis dinner for the night. Digging and\ndigging in the little garden, planting\ntiny seeds that grow into big melons. To\nensure the freshness of the ingredients,\nFun Yu decided to pick only what he\nwould eat. Therefore, he did not use the\nsystems one-click harvesting function,\nbut instead picked the fruits and\nvegetables from the fields one by one by\nhand. Only when harvesting wheat did\nFong You choose the systems one-click\nharvesting function. I used two\neggplants to make eggplant with minced\nmeat and four green peppers to make\nstir- fried green peppers with shredded\npork. I also cut a bunch of chives to\nmake chive and chive dumplings with the\nleftover bacon. To make dumplings, you\nnaturally need flour. and the material\nfor making flour is wheat. He then took\nthe ingredients back to the cabin, put\nall the collected wheat into the\nworkbench to grind it into flour, and\ntook the vegetables into the kitchen. It\nwasn't completely dark yet, so Valentina\nhadn't come out. Whenever Fongu cooked,\nhe would have Valentina help him and\nteach her how to cook various dishes so\nhe could be lazy in the future. But Fong\nYu was already eager to cook the dishes,\nso he started making dinner without\nwaiting for Valentina to come out. When\nFong Yu finished preparing the dinner\nand brought the dishes out of the\nkitchen, he was startled to find a\nfigure wrapped in bandages sitting at\nthe dining table in the living room. He\nalmost dropped the bowl of food he was\nholding. \"You, who are you?\" Fongu took\na step back into the kitchen, ready to\nimmediately go back and grab a cleaver\nif things got out of hand. At that\nmoment, Valentina floated out of her\nroom and said to Fong Yu with a smile,\n\"Master, it is Ryan. Ryan.\" Fong Yu\nraised an eyebrow upon hearing this and\nlooked again at the figure wrapped in\nburlap like a mummy, but he couldn't\nmake out who it was. However, he\nnaturally believed Valentina. At this\nmoment, he also saw Alfa sitting next to\nthe mummy, drooling and staring intently\nat the bowl of food in Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s\nhand. Fong Yu breathed a sigh of relief.\nWalked to the table, put down the bowl\nof food, and carefully examined Ryan.\n\"Why are you wrapped up like this?\" Funu\nasked puzzled. Ryan pointed to his\nthroat, waved his hand, and then looked\nat Valentina. Valentina then explained\nfor Ryan. Ryan's body has entered the\nfinal stage of recovery. He will slowly\ngrow new skin and flesh. \"The process is\nnot very pleasant, and he was afraid\nthat you, master, would find it\ndistasteful, so he wrapped himself in\nburlap.\" I see,\" Fun Yu said with a\nsmile as he walked to Ryan's side,\npatted it on the shoulder, and laughed.\n\"Actually, it's okay since we're all\npartners. There's no such thing as\ndisliking or not disliking each other.\"\nRyan was deeply moved by Fong Yu's words\nand nodded vigorously. \"Can you eat\nnow?\" Fong Yu asked again. Ryan shook\nhis head and Valentina explained, \"Its\ninternal organs are regenerating and it\nwill take some time for them to fully\nrecover.\" Okay, let's wait a little\nlonger then. Fongu smiled. Whenever you\ncan eat again, I'll cook a whole table\nof delicious food for you. Oh, and\nValentina, too. Once you have a physical\nform, I'll cook you a whole table of\ngood food, too. Valentina smiled sweetly\nupon hearing this. I'm really looking\nforward to it, master. At this moment,\nAlfa also started to bark. Woof woof\nwoof. this time without Valentina\ntranslating. Fun, you guessed what Guzy\nwanted to say. Forget about you. You've\nbeen eating all the time with me lately,\nand your belly has gotten so round.\nDon't you have any self-awareness? Woo!\nAlpha retracted its head. This is called\ndumplings, a traditional dish from my\nhometown. Actually, you could call it a\nstaple food. It can be steamed, fried,\nboiled, or deep fried, but since we're\nlimited by resources, I boiled it. Come\nto Alpha and try it out. see how it\ntastes. So, with his companions by his\nside, Fong Yu ate his first Chinese\ndinner since arriving in the survival\nworld. After dinner, Fong Yu cleared the\ntable and then took the strange book he\nhad won in the lottery from the corner\nand placed it on the table. Valentina,\ncan you help me figure out what this\nbook is? When Valentina saw the strange\npurplish black book, even she, who had\nremained calm throughout, showed a look\nof shock. She quickly floated to the\ntable, stared intently at the book for a\nwhile, and then slowly said, \"This This\ncould this be the legendary book of the\nevil god.\" Fongu nodded and replied,\n\"That is indeed its name. Is this thing\nreally a divine artifact?\" Fongu\nexpressed great doubt. Valentina turned\nto look at the book of evil gods on the\ntable and said, \"This magic book was\ncreated by the goddess of magic, Melis.\nIt contains all the knowledge related to\nmagic and even has its own storage\nability and magic array. Theoretically,\nas long as you have enough magic power,\neven a magic apprentice can use it to\ncast any spell. Holy crap. Fong Yu's\neyes widened in amazement. Wow, that's\nawesome. But then Valentina shook her\nhead with a rice smile and said,\n\"However, later when the abyss god\ninvaded during the battle between the\ngod of magic, Mellis, and the god of\nmagic, Shira, this magic book was\ncorrupted by the chaotic will of the\nevil god, and it developed its own\nconsciousness, even turning into a\nmonster. Later, it was sealed in the\ndemon realm by the god of magic.\" As she\nspoke, Valentina glanced at Alpha beside\nher and said with a strange expression,\nAlpha used to guard this artifact in the\ndemon realm. Later, because the artifact\nwas lost, it was afraid of being held\naccountable, so it fled to the human\nworld. Upon hearing this, Fong Yu turned\nto look at Alpha and realized, \"No\nwonder. I was wondering why you knew the\nsix-pointed star on that book could seal\nit when we were in the woods.\" Alpha\nstuck out its tongue and grinned\nsheepishly. So, how exactly do you use\nthis thing? Funu asked again. Is it just\nabout feeding it and then making it\nvomit? Valentina shook her head and\nsaid, \"Nobody knows the specific usage\nmethod, but the storage space inside was\nonce the storage space of the god of\nmagic. Nobody knows how many items are\ninside, but most of them should be good\nthings. You can try feeding it more\nfood. Maybe it can even vomit up another\nartifact of the god of magic for you.\"\nChapter 79. The third profession,\nalchemist, to test what treasures were\nhidden inside this book of evil gods,\nFong Yu specially exchanged a bunch of\nfood from the exchange and then had\nValentina remotely open the six-pointed\nstar badge on the cover of the strange\nbook. Wow. The moment the six-pointed\nstar seal was broken, the pages of the\nstrange book immediately flipped open,\nrevealing a gaping moth full of fangs.\nAnd at the same time, the eyeball on the\ncover of the strange book also opened.\nThe eerie purple eyes glanced around,\nand after confirming that the closest\nperson was Ryan sitting at the table, a\ngreedy light suddenly flashed in the\npurple eyes. \"Wow!\" the strange book\nyelled and leaped toward Ryan, seemingly\nwanting to tear him apart. However, Ryan\nsimply raised his arm, which was wrapped\nin burlap, and slammed it down hard on\nthe strange book. Bang! Under the heavy\nblow, the Book of Evil God was smashed\nonto the table. But this did not harm\nit. So, it quickly got up again, ready\nto tear Ryan apart. Bang! Another\npowerful punch landed, and the book of\nevil gods slumped onto the table once\nmore, but it remained defiant and\ncontinued to climb up. Bang! Bang! And\nso after 10 minutes, the book of evil\ngod finally lay still on the table. Its\nonce ferocious eyes now filled with fear\nas it stared at the mummy like Ryan. ABA\naba aba Ryan said in a horse voice,\npointing at the strange book. Valentina\ntranslated. Lane said that to deal with\nthis kind of guy, you just have to beat\nhim into submission. This little bit of\ndamage shouldn't be of any use to it,\nright? Funu asked somewhat puzzled. It\ncertainly won't hurt it, but it can make\nit feel pain and make it dizzy. Fong was\ncompletely dumbfounded. You can do it\nlike this. In any case, Ryan managed to\ntame this bizarre book of evil gods. So,\nFongu began to try feeding it. Start by\nfeeding it the cheapest berries. After\nfeeding it 10 berries, the strange book\nsmacked its lips and reluctantly spat\nout a water elemental crystal. So Fong,\nyou tried feeding the strange book\nanother piece of cumin roasted meat.\nThis time after the strange book\nfinished eating, it stuck out its tongue\nand licked it, seemingly still wanting\nmore. Then it spat out a fire element\ncrystal. Eating a live feeasant will\nmake you spit out an elemental crystal,\nand eating a piece of cooked human\nroasted meat will also make you spit out\nan elemental crystal. In other words,\nthe amount of resources the strange book\nspews out is actually related to how\ndelicious the food is. With this in\nmind, Fongu had a bold idea. \"Do you\nhave anything else to vomit?\" Fongu\nasked tentatively. However, the strange\nbook ignored him, continuing to lick its\nlips with its tongue, as if waiting to\nbe fed. So, Fong, you cooked the dozen\nor so chive and egg dumplings that\nhadn't been cooked yet in the kitchen,\nthen brought them to the strange book\nand fed them to it one by one. This guy\nwasn't afraid of getting burned. He ate\nthe freshly cooked dumplings one bite at\na time, eating with great joy, almost\nbiting his tongue several times.\nFinally, after finishing the pot of\ndumplings, the eyes on the cover of the\nstrange book showed a satisfied\nexpression. And then the strange book\nopened its mouth and spat out a small\ngray book. Calling it a book is a bit of\nan exaggeration. It looks only slightly\nlarger than a mobile phone, more like a\nlaptop. After spitting out the little\nbook, the strange book closed its mouth\nand eyes and quieted down, seemingly\nhaving eaten its fill. Fu raised an\neyebrow slightly as he looked at the\nsmall book that the book of evil god had\nspat out on the table. I hope it's not\nsome weird man-eating book corrupted by\nan evil god. So, suppressing his nausea,\nhe carefully picked up the gray notebook\nand began to examine it. Basic enchanted\nalchemy notes. Green contains basic\nintroductory knowledge for alchemists.\nLooking at the alchemy notes in his\nhand, Fongu suddenly thought of\nsomething. I had previously crafted an\nenchanting table. But unfortunately, to\ncreate magical items using an enchanting\ntable, I had to change my job to become\nan alchemist. The requirement for\nbecoming an alchemist was actually a\nlow-level mage plus basic knowledge of\nenchanted alchemy. So, at that time, as\na magic apprentice, he could only leave\nhis enchanting table in a corner to\ngather dust. Fong Yu has now reached the\nlevel of a low-level mage and was only\nmissing a basic enchanted alchemy\nnotebook. Now he has the notebook. That\nmeans I can change my profession to\nalchemist. You have met the requirements\nfor becoming an alchemist. Low-level\nmage plus basic knowledge of enchanted\nalchemy. Do you wish to change jobs? Is\nthere even a question? You absolutely\nmust change jobs. Asking you as a favor.\nI advise you not to be ungrateful. Okay.\nOkay. Let's go around and around. Fong\nYu admitted defeat. Then a purple gold\nlight shown from Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s body, and\nthe hidden six-pointed star mark on Fong\nYu&lt;unk&gt;s forehead lit up again. Then, a\ncircle of thorn flower wreath marks\nappeared around the six-pointed star\nmagic circle before slowly disappearing\nagain. In an instant, the notebook in\nhis hand turned into dust. But countless\nstrange and wonderful alchemical\nknowledge flooded into Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s\nmind. The flood of knowledge caused a\nsharp pain in his head, and it took him\na while to recover. After all, the\nnotebook contained so much information,\ncovering almost all the alchemical items\nin the world, as well as the knowledge\nof their magical reactions. Funu sat\nthere in a days for over an hour before\nfinally emerging from this vast ocean of\nknowledge. During this time, his three\ncompanions did not disturb him, but\nsimply watched over him in perfect\nharmony. You have successfully become an\nalchemist. Wow. Funu took a deep breath\nafter waking up and exclaimed, \"It feels\nlike I've spent a semester at Hogwarts.\"\nAt the same time, Fong Yu also\ndiscovered that the benefits of this\nnotebook were far greater than expected.\nObtaining the alchemist job change\nqualification was secondary. The\nimportant thing was that he gained the\nability to identify items from a\ndistance. Now, when Fongu goes out to\nexplore, he can directly retrieve the\ndata of anything he can see, even if it\nis far away, as long as it is related to\ndemonic alchemy and recorded in his\nnotes. He no longer needs to walk up to\nthe object to get a hint from the game\nassistant, as he did before. This\nundoubtedly greatly increased his\nchances of obtaining treasures during\nhis subsequent explorations. Just like\nhow a butcher gains two skills and a\nunique weapon upon job advancement and a\nmage gains 50 spirit, the alchemist's\nability to discern should also be a\nhidden attribute and one that is\nextremely valuable. Funu smiled\ncontentedly. He now had three\nprofessions: butcher, mage, and\nalchemist, which was quite a lot\nconsidering that most players hadn't\neven had the chance to change\nprofessions yet. Moreover, with that\nbook of evil gods, as long as I feed it\nevery day, I can continuously obtain\nsome magical materials or skill books.\nOf course, what it spits out depends on\nluck on one hand, and on how good the\nfood I feed the strange book is on the\nother. So, Fongu decided to take some\ntime to research a few new dishes to see\nwhich flavors the book of evil gods\npreferred and try to get it to spit out\nsome good stuff. Of course, that's all\nfor the future. Right now, the most\nimportant thing is to immediately change\ncareers and become an alchemist because\nalchemy can not only create magical\nitems but also enchant existing\nequipment. Chapter 80. Fongu support\ngroup. Having inherited the skills of\nboth magician and alchemist, Fong Yu\nalso gained a clearer understanding of\nthese two professions. Magicians are\nmore focused on combat while alchemists\nare more focused on research. In fact,\nthese two professions can complement\neach other. The higher the level of a\nmage, the more magic power they will\nhave and the more precise their magical\ncontrol, which will be more conducive to\nincreasing the success rate of alchemy.\nWith the blessing of the alchemist\nprofession, one can collect materials to\ncraft many magical items such as staves,\nrobes, rings, and various magical\npotions to increase the damage cap and\nsustainability of magic. Therefore, Fong\nYu felt it was necessary to study the\nspecifics of alchemy carefully. Fong Yu\narrived at the enchanting table. Now\nthat he had the title of alchemist, he\ncould finally use the enchanting table.\nWhen his hand touched the enchanting\ntable, three options appeared in front\nof him. Magic item crafting, magic\npotion crafting, enchantment. He first\nopened the magic item crafting options,\nwhich were empty because he had not\nlearned any magic item crafting\nblueprints. Then he opened the magic\npotion making options which showed many\noptions such as spider gland ointment,\nrecovery soup, truth potion, aphrodesiac\nand other strange and varied potion\nnames which dazzled Fongu. However, most\nof them could not be made due to a lack\nof materials. Only one spider gland\nointment could be made. Spider gland\nointment crafting requirements 1151\nspider gland 258 to one wood ash 1025\nmagic points can be crafted spider gland\nointment white the simplest potion in\npotion making but it's very effective at\ntreating external injuries. Skin wounds\ncan heal within a day and it's\nespecially effective against spider\nvenom. After reading the description of\nthe ointment, Fong Yu immediately perked\nup. He knew that this was a world of\nsurvival where many people died every\nday and injuries were common place. If\nit's just a minor injury, that's fine.\nBut if it's an injury to the hands or\nfeet that affects mobility and they\ncan't go out to collect supplies for\ndays, that's basically a death sentence\nwith a reprieve. If it's an injury to\nvital organs, then they can only wait to\ndie. Therefore, medicine that can be\nused to heal injuries is definitely the\nsecond most important resource after\nfood. Especially for injured players, it\ncan be a lifesaver. Fongu specifically\nchecked the exchange to see if there\nwere any healing ointments for sale.\nHowever, the medicine section mainly\ncontained the lowest grade unprocessed\nherbs with mediocre efficacy. It took\nhim a while to find someone selling\nready-made ointments. Seller Liao Fang\nID 520. Item for sale. Spider gland\nointment green. Exchange rate 200 wood\nor 150 gravel. It's the only ointment\nthat can be made at the enchanting\ntable. Upon seeing this consignment\nlisting, Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s first thought\nwas, \"Holy crap, could it be that other\nplayers in this region can also craft\nenchanting tables?\" But then he noticed\nthe seller's name, Lu X Yaoang. Isn't\nthat the lucky girl who sold rum and the\nbutcher's technique last time? Could it\nbe that she picked up this ointment\nagain? Fong Yu remembered that he\nhappened to be friends with this girl,\nso he sent her a message and asked her\nabout it. Fong Yu ID00006.\nHello. Could you please tell me where\nyou got your spider gland ointment? If\nit's inconvenient for you to answer,\nthat's fine. Fongu needed to find out\nthe truth about this. If the other party\nmade it, it meant that they also had an\nenchanting table. And if they had an\nenchanting table, it meant that they\nalso had a manor. If that's the case,\nthen Lu Xiao Fang is quite something.\nAnd her house doesn't seem to be far\nfrom mine. So maybe we could form a\nstrategic alliance or something. A short\nwhile later, the other party replied,\n\"Lao Fang, ID520. Hey, it's Fong Yu. I\nfound that ointment in a treasure chest\ninside a spider cave. What's up? Do you\nwant that ointment? If it's you, I can\ngive you a 20% discount. Call.\" Upon\nseeing the reply, Fong Yu couldn't help\nbut feel somewhat disappointed. To be\nhonest, he had a good impression of Lu\nXiao Fang. If she had the ability to\nupgrade to the manor in such a short\ntime, he would be interested in joining\nforces with her. At this moment, Lu Xiao\nFang sent another message. Lu Xiao Fang\nID520. Hey bro, I want to ask you\nsomething. Fong Yu ID006, what's up? Lu\nXiao Fang ID 520, why have you always\nbeen unwilling to become a lord? Fong\nwas taken aback when the other party\nasked him this question. Fong Yu ID006.\nWhy did you ask me this question? Loose\nYao Fang ID 520. Because I am now the\npresident of Fong Yu's fan club and the\nother members in the club asked me to\nask you. Fong Yu ID006. Huh? A fan club?\nWhen did I actually have a fan club? Lu\nXiaoang ID520. This was just established\ntoday. Many friends can't stand those\nguys who spend all day in the chat\nchannel trying to get votes for\nthemselves to become the lord. They all\nhope you can become the lord. So they\nestablished the fongu boss support\ngroup. Let's all support you to become\nthe lord. Fongu was a little confused as\nthe person involved. He was actually the\nlast to find out. Fongu ID006.\nThen why are you the president? Liaoang\nID 520. because out of all the members I\nwas the first to add you as a friend and\nit seems that you have only chatted with\nme and you don't reply to messages from\nother people. Funu suddenly realized why\nhe was the last to know. It wasn't that\nothers didn't tell him but that he\nhimself refused to share the information\nwith the outside world. There was\nnothing he could do. Almost every day\nhundreds of people would request to add\nhim as a friend. and players who had\nalready added him as a friend would also\nsend messages from time to time. In\norder not to be disturbed, Fong Yu\nsimply muted the chat channel. Fong Yu\nthought for a moment and then replied,\n\"Then why do you prefer me to be the\nLord? Wouldn't it be the same if those\nother people were the lords?\" \"Lao Fang,\nID 520. Of course, it's different.\nEveryone in district 6 knows that you've\ncontributed the most to District 6. If\nit weren't for the information you\nselflessly shared before, many more\npeople would have died in our district.\nYou've contributed the most to our\ndistrict, so everyone wants you to be\nthe Lord. Our support group now has\n1,500 members. As long as you're willing\nto run for Lord, you'll definitely\nsucceed. After reading Lu Xiaoangs\ninformation, Funu felt somewhat ashamed\nbecause he had not shared the\ninformation selflessly. His initial\npurpose in sharing the information was\nonly to make money and secondly to\nreduce the number of deaths in district\n6 so that they would not be unable to\ncompete with other districts later. He\nreally didn't expect that such a\nself-protective move would be remembered\nby so many players in the district and\neven lead to the formation of their own\nsupport group. At this moment,\ninformation about the game assistant\nXiaolu appeared in the air. The players\nwho have survived this long aren't\nfools. They can guess that those who are\nobsessed with becoming lords are mostly\nambitious opportunists blinded by\nself-interest. So rather than letting\nthose kinds of people become lords, they\nwould naturally prefer someone like you\nwho has contributed to the entire server\nand doesn't covet lordship power to be\nthe lord. Chapter 81. All element battle\nmage. Xiaolu&lt;unk&gt;s words suddenly\nenlightened Fongu and he smiled\nhelplessly. It seems that my reputation\nin district 6 is getting higher and\nhigher, but he knew that now was not the\nright time to be a lord. His most\nimportant task at the moment was to\nimprove his own strength. Funu ID006, I\nappreciate your kindness, but please\ntell the people in the support group\nthat I don't think I'm capable enough to\nfulfill the responsibilities of a lord\nand need more experience. If you\nabsolutely must choose a lord, you can\nconsider selecting a player with\noutstanding coordination skills from the\nsupport group. As long as it's an\nelection by popular vote, I will fully\nsupport it.\" Fun Yu&lt;unk&gt;s reply was\nquite sophisticated. He did not refuse\noutright, but instead declined the\nsupport group's request to become the\nlord, citing his lack of ability.\nHowever, he's not stupid. This fan club\nwas established in his name, so the\nplayers in it should all be people who\nlike him. If these players can unite,\nthey can actually be a considerable\nforce. Moreover, it's a force gathered\nin Fong Yu's name. He simply didn't want\nto waste his time and energy becoming a\nlord. That didn't mean he wanted to\nreject this force that was so kind to\nhim. To put it another way, Fun Yu&lt;unk&gt;s\nthoughts were no different from those in\nthe support group. Rather than letting\nunfamiliar, profit-driven people become\nlords. It would be better to let someone\nwho was more benevolent to him take the\nposition. As a rational person, one\nstarting point for considering anything\nis naturally from one's own interests.\nTherefore, for Fong Yu, choosing a lord\nfrom his own fan club would naturally be\nof the greatest benefit to him. Why not\navoid the responsibilities of a lord and\nminimize any negative influences from\nthe lord. A moment later, Lu Xiaoang\nreplied to the message. Lu Xiaoang\nID520. But there are so many people in\nthe support group, it's hard to choose.\nand everyone joined the support group\nbecause they wanted to support you. It's\nnot appropriate to let them run for Lord\nthemselves. How about I add you to the\nsupport groups group chat and you can\ntalk to them yourself. Huh? There's even\na group chat. Fongu rarely looks at his\nfriend list and had never even noticed\nthe group chat feature. Fongu ID00006.\nOkay, then add me in. A short while\nlater, a message popped up. friend Lu\nXiao Fang ID520 invites you to join the\ngroup chat. Fong use YDS fan club 1356\nmembers. Do you agree? I didn't expect\nthere to be over a thousand people in\nthe group. But the group name sounds\nkind of embarrassing, Fong Yu said, both\namused and exasperated and then accepted\nthe request. The next second, a group\nchat option appeared in the friend's\nchat channel. Before Fong you could\nclick on it, he saw the number of unread\nmessages inside increase rapidly. Zang\nUranian ID 1213. Holy crap. Did I see\nthat right? That lazy bum joined the\ngroup. Zhao Mingin ID 211. Cough cough.\nZang Ursian ID 1213. Please be careful\nwith your wording. Lie Jinu ID 6312.\nHaha. Fongu has finally joined the\ngroup. I've been waiting so long. Song\nJiming ID 3533. Hey, upstairs. What\nflower have you withered? Lu Xiao Fang\nID520. Let's warmly welcome Fong Yu to\nthe group. Tangan ID 9527.\nHoly crap, my salty fish bro is finally\nwilling to become a lord. Chin Xiaoi\nID717. Yay, Fongu is awesome. He'll\ncarry us to victory in PUBG from now on.\nLeong Pingping ID566.\nHey bro, let's quickly choose a place to\nset up a settlement. Living alone is\nreally too dangerous. Yao Juwin ID 357\nBoss, if you become a lord, can you\nappoint me as the general of my\nprotected area? Looking at the players\nlaughing and joking in the group chat,\nFongu couldn't help but laugh. In a way,\nthese people were all his fans. Although\ntheir loyalty was still debatable, the\natmosphere was much better than in the\nregional chat channel. At least there\nwere no trolls or haters. Therefore,\nFong Yu once again expressed his\nthoughts in the fan club's group chat,\nbelieving that he was not capable enough\nto be the Lord and suggesting that\nsomeone with management experience be\nnominated to run for Lord. The players\nin the group seemed to have been\nprepared for Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s repeated\nrefusal to run for Lord. After\ncomplaining for a while, they started\ndiscussing who should be nominated to\nrun for Lord. The night passed and\nbefore we knew it, it was the last day\nof autumn. Before dawn, Fongu got up and\nbegan to study how to make weapons for\nthe ghosts. But then he suddenly\nremembered that the ghosts seemed unable\nto touch physical objects. The reason\nthose ghost miners could use the pickaxe\nwas because they had a deep bond with\nit. But the weapons I made had no such\nbond with them. So how could I make them\nuse them? After the question arose in my\nmind, the game assistant provided the\nanswer. The physical tools or weapons\nthat ghosts can use are generally deeply\nconnected to them. Apart from that,\nghosts can only use soul weapons forged\nby necromancers using their soul power.\nNecromancer. Seeing this, Fongu was at\nhis wit's end. He knew that necromancer\nwas a profession. So, he immediately\nsearched the exchange to see if there\nwere any skill books related to\nnecromancer job advancement, but he\ncouldn't find any. Just as Fongu was\nabout to give up on making weapons for\nthe ghosts, Valentina came out of the\nkitchen carrying a freshlymade\nbreakfast. Master, breakfast is ready\ntoday. It's fried eggs and steamed\npumpkin. Fong Yu turned to look at\nValentina and suddenly thought of\nsomething. Necromancer. Isn't Valentina\nan undead? And she's a mage, too.\nAlthough Fong Yu knew that a dead mage\nwasn't necessarily a necromancer, he\nstill asked Valentina just to try his\nluck. Valentina, are you a necromancer?\nHuh? Valentina tilted her head, looking\ncompletely bewildered, and replied, \"I'm\nnot a necromancer.\" Fongu was\nimmediately disappointed upon hearing\nthis. \"I am an all-elemental combat\nmage. What? Chapter 82, soul blade?\"\nFongsu's eyes widened. Battle mage and\nall types. What exactly do you mean by\nall elemental battle mage? Valentina\nlowered her head shyly and smiled\nbashfully, saying softly, \"I know a\nlittle bit of all the magic systems, but\nmost of them are related to combat.\"\nFongu suddenly realized that the magic\nValentina had instilled in him before\nwas either offensive magic like fireball\nand water arrow, or defensive magic like\nfire shield, water shield, and earth\nshield. The rest were various\nbuffenhancing rune magic, all of which\nwere related to combat. \"Do you know\nnecromancy?\" Funu asked again. Valentina\nnodded and said, \"I've learned some\nbefore, but my level of necromancy isn't\nvery high.\" \"Not very tall, then how\ntall is it? More or less a mage?\" Fongu\npressed his hand to his chest and took a\ndeep breath. \"Damn it, this little girl\nactually managed to get to Versailles.\"\n\"Master, do you want to learn\nnecromancy?\" Valentina asked curiously.\n\"But speaking of which, necromancy seems\nquite suitable for you. Come to think of\nit, you and the undead seem to have a\nspecial connection. Fong Yu chuckled\nawkwardly upon hearing this. Is it\npossible to inherit this haunted house\nif we're not destined to? We can talk\nabout learning necromancy another day.\nFong Yu waved his hand and said, \"What I\nwant to do now is make some soul weapons\nthat ghosts can use. I heard that only\nnecromancers can make them, so I wanted\nto ask you, do you know how to make\nthem?\" Valentino laughed and said, \"If\nit's the lowest level soul weapon, then\nI might try to make it. That's great.\nCome on, let's give it a try.\" As he\nspoke, Fong Yu called Valentina to the\nenchanting table because soul weapons\nare magical artifacts and therefore\nrequire an enchanting table. Valentina's\ncrafting methods differ from Fongu's.\nFong Yu has the support of the game\nsystem, so crafting items only requires\npreparing the materials and blueprints,\nand the rest is handled by the crafting\ntable or enchanting table. However, as a\nnative, Valentina crafts weapons\nentirely based on her past knowledge.\nThe simplest soul weapon is the soul\nblade, and the materials needed are also\nvery simple. One mythal ingot plus 10\nunits of magic power, Valentina\nexplained to Fong Yu, who was standing\nnext to her. Of all the known materials,\nMithril ingot is the one that resonates\nmost with soul energy, so it is needed\nfor the crafting and enchanting of many\nhighlevel weapons. Fun nodded. He had\nseen this in basic notes on enchanted\nalchemy, but reading a book 10 times is\nnot as good as practicing it once.\nWatching Valentina slowly melt the\nMyithil ingot with magical flames and\nlistening to her explanation, Fong Yu\nfinally gained a deep understanding of\nthe properties of Mithil. Besides its\nsoft texture, low melting point, and\nability to resonate with magic and soul\nenergy, Myithil also has the advantage\nof being easy to shape. Therefore,\nMyithil has always been a favorite\nmaterial for mages and alchemists, and\nit is very expensive, Valentina\nexplained. Although the raw materials\nare important, the control of magic\nduring the refining process is even more\ncrucial. This is the key to shaping the\nsoul blade. And to achieve this level of\ncontrol over magic, one needs at least a\nmage or alchemist of the archage level.\nFunu nodded repeatedly, humbly accepting\nthe instruction. But at the same time,\nhe also realized a problem. Using the\nsystem to create items eliminates all\nthe problems in the crafting process.\nAnd as long as the system doesn't\nindicate a failure rate, there's no need\nto worry about failure, which is an\nadvantage. The downside is that players\nalso lose knowledge of the crafting\nprocess and opportunities to practice.\nThe system will only craft items of\nsuperior quality or lower for players.\nPlayers will need to craft items of epic\nquality or higher themselves. Really,\nFongu raised an eyebrow. If that's the\ncase, he still needs to practice\ncrafting some items in advance to\nimprove his control over magic.\nOtherwise, he'll be completely lost if\nhe wants to craft items of epic quality\nor higher in the future. Soon, Valentina\nbegan crafting the soul blade using the\nenchanting table while Fong Yu watched\nand learned attentively. But 5 minutes\nlater, Fongu had to give up because\nwatching Valentina's movements was like\na primary school student watching a\nuniversity student self-calculus. He\nrecognized all the numbers but didn't\nrecognize anything else. Tsk tsk it\nseems I still have a lot to learn. Funu\nshook his head inside. After all, I've\nonly studied basic enchanted alchemy\nnotes. To reach Valentina's level, I'd\nprobably need at least intermediate\nenchanted alchemy or higher knowledge.\nSigh. It seems this can't be rushed.\nLet's take it one step at a time. Since\ncrafting 10 soul blades would take a\nlong time and would require an entire\nnight, Valentina told Fong Yu to go to\nsleep first. When Fong Yu woke up the\nnext day, he came to the living room and\nsaw 11 exquisite daggers, each about 20\ncm long, shimmering with silver purple\nlight, neatly arranged on the table.\nValentina had also prepared breakfast\nand put it on the table. Soul Blade,\nblue forged from Mithril, a material\nmore precious than gold by necromancers\nof archage rank or higher. It is an\nextremely rare soul weapon. Um,\nValentina, why is there an extra one?\nFunu asked. The extra one was custom\nmade for you, master. Valentina said\nwith a smile. Soul weapons can be hidden\nin any part of your body, serving as a\nconcealed weapon that can achieve\nunexpected effects. After saying that,\nunder Valentina's guidance, Fong Yu used\nhis mental power to stab a soul blade on\nthe table into his palm. To his\nsurprise, no wound appeared on his palm,\nbut he could clearly feel that the\ndagger was hidden in his wrist, which\nwas quite amazing. Fong was about to\nthank Valentina when he looked at her\nand noticed that she looked somewhat\nhaggarded, and even her previously\ncondensed soul body had become somewhat\ntransparent again. After a moment's\nthought, Fong Yu guessed that the sole\nweapon she had been forging all night\nmust have taken a toll on her. Thinking\nof this, Fongu couldn't help but feel\nguilty. Valentina had only recovered a\nlittle after so many days of\naccumulation, but she had become weak\nagain because of helping him forge these\nweapons. Valentina, I'm sorry. It was my\noversight to have you refined so many at\nonce. You must have used up a lot of\nyour soul power, right? Fongu asked\nworriedly. Valentina smiled and shook\nher head, saying, \"It's all right,\nmaster. I'll just go back to my room and\nrest for a bit. I'm happy to be able to\ndo something for you.\" Looking at this\nkind and understanding ghost girl who\nwas devoted to him wholeheartedly, Fongu\nwas moved, and took her back to his\nroom, told her to rest well, and then\nate all the breakfast she had made.\nAfter finishing the meal, Fongu couldn't\nhelp but sigh that Valentina's cooking\nskills were getting better and better.\nIndeed, the meat patties fried with\nmagical flames tasted different. Chapter\n83. The mine was robbed. After\nbreakfast, Fong Yu put on the wild boar\narmor set that Valentina had cleaned and\nprepared and headed out to the mine with\nthe tin mythil daggers he had prepared\nfor the ghosts. At that moment, Ryan's\nbedroom door opened, and Ryan appeared\nbefore Fong Yu, carrying a rusty iron\naxe. Fong Yu stared blankly at Ryan, who\nwas wrapped in burlap like a mummy, and\nasked, \"Why are you out here? Aren't you\nsupposed to rest during the day?\" Ryan\nshook his head and replied in a horse\nvoice, \"Master, I can now move around\nduring the day, so I'll go out with you\ntoday.\" Hearing Ryan say that he could\nnow move around during the day, Fong Yu\nwas naturally overjoyed, as it meant\nthat his safety was further guaranteed.\nBut Fong Yu immediately realized, \"You\ncan talk.\" Funu looked at Ryan in\nsurprise. Ryan nodded slightly and said,\n\"The flesh in your throat has grown a\nbit, but your voice is still very sound\ngood.\" \"Hey, what's good or bad about\nit? I'm not asking you to sing. As long\nas we can communicate, that's fine.\"\nFunu laughed. \"You don't know how\ndifficult it was for me to communicate\nwith Alpha every time I went out with it\nbefore.\" Upon hearing this, the dog\nrolled its eyes at Fong Yu, thinking to\nitself, \"Is it my fault that you can't\nunderstand dog language?\" So, a happy\nFongu led Alpha and Ryan toward the\nmine. With Ryan joining his expedition\nteam, Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s confidence swelled\nlike never before. After all, he had\nwitnessed Ryan's battle axe skills\nfirsthand. He could easily sweep away a\nhundred giant spiders by himself, and\nthat was only in his previous skeleton\nform. After these few days of killing,\nRyan's body had recovered to about 70 to\n80%. And his combat power must be much\nstronger than before. In addition,\nValentina crafted 11 soul blades for\nherself. If these were equipped on the\nghosts in the mine, it would be\nequivalent to adding another small army\nimmune to physical attacks. In addition,\nhe made simple explosive charges from\nthe sulfur ore, nitrate ore, and coal he\ndug out of the mine last night in\nproportion to a total of 88 simple\nexplosive charges. With this firepower,\nit should be enough to take over Pingan\nCounty. I mean, to take over that\nunderground palace, right? Thinking\nabout defeating the dwarf demon and the\ngiant cat in the palace and then reaping\nthe mountain of treasure in the vault,\nFong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s heart couldn't help but\nwarm up. Tsk tsk feels like this is\nabout to take off. However, after Fongu\nshared his thoughts with Ryan, Ryan\nshook his head and replied. Based on\nyour description, with our current\ncombat strength, the failure rate of\nattacking that underground palace is\nstill over 90%. Huh? What? Funu asked\npuzzled. First of all, there's the\ndifference in numbers. Crypt dwarves are\nsocial demons, and a single group can\nnumber no less than a thousand. Are you\nsure that those 10 ghosts along with you\nand me can kill so many dwarves?\nBesides, there are some very powerful\nbeings among the dwarfs. If it were the\ndwarf chieftain, I probably wouldn't be\na match for him in my current state.\nMoreover, you yourself said that there\nis a Titan cat in that treasure vault.\nDo you know that the fighting power of a\nTitan cat is actually no less than that\nof an adult dragon? I really can't\nbelieve that you and Alpha were able to\nescape from the Titan cat. Ryan's words\nwere like a bucket of cold water,\ninstantly extinguishing Fong Yu's\nexcitement. Indeed, the explosive charge\nwas so powerful that it could easily\nshatter even boulders, yet it couldn't\nkill the giant cat, even when pressed\nagainst its face. This is enough to show\nthat the giant cat's defense is as solid\nas a rock. Coupled with its speed of\nmoving dozens of meters silently in the\nblink of an eye, its combat power is\ntruly off the charts. Thankfully, the\ngame assistant reminded him that the\ngiant cat was timid by nature, which\ngave him the idea to keep throwing\nexplosives to scare the cat and buy\nhimself time to escape. Last time, Fongu\nwas able to ambush the giant cat because\nit was unfamiliar with the power of the\nexplosive pack. But if the explosive\npack is used against it again this time,\ngiven its speed, it will definitely not\ngive the explosive pack a chance to get\nclose. You're right. I was thinking too\nsimply. Fonu agreed with Ryan's point of\nview and said, \"In that case, let's not\ngo to the underground world for now. Why\ndon't you come with me to Yorktown\ntoday? It's autumn for the next two\ndays, and it would be a bit troublesome\nto go in winter.\" After a moment's\nthought, Ryan nodded. With him and Alpha\nprotecting him, his master's safety in\nYorktown should be guaranteed. Before\nthat, we still need to take a look at\nthe mine. It's on the way anyway.\nAccording to Ryan, Yorktown is about 2\nkilometers northeast of the mine. Before\nlong, the two men and the dog arrived at\nthe mine. Once inside, they saw ghost\nSteve float out of the wooden house. Mr.\nFong Yu, you've arrived. Steve greeted\nFong Yu with a smile. Fongu looked\naround but didn't see any other ghosts,\nso he asked, \"Where are the others?\"\nSteve replied, \"They're all working in\nthe mine. I'm the only one here. Didn't\nyou say that we need to ensure someone\nis always watching over the supplies on\nthe surface? After Steve's reminder,\nFong Yu realized that he had indeed\narranged this. So, he asked, \"Have any\nstrangers entered this mine recently?\"\nAfter recalling for a moment, Steve\nnodded and said, \"No one has come in\nsince you left yesterday. But when I was\nwandering around the mine this morning,\nI heard some noise at the entrance.\"\nHowever, when I came out, I didn't find\nanyone, only this strange shoe. As he\nspoke, Steve pointed to the table next\nto him, on which was a shoe. Although it\nwas covered in mud and dust, Fong Yu\nrecognized the hook on the shoe at a\nglance. Nike sneakers, women's style.\nFong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s eyes widened. These shoes\ncould only belong to players, which\nmeant that the mine had already been\ndiscovered by other players. When Fong\nYu picked up the shoe on the table,\nscraped off the mud and grime with a\ndagger, and examined it carefully, he\nfinally remembered the owner of the\nshoe. It was the woman Wu Fong Lang\nthreatened in the woods nearby\nyesterday. Fongu remembered that she was\nwearing the same style of shoes at the\ntime. In other words, this woman arrived\nat this mine very early this morning. At\nthis moment, Fong Yu also recalled what\nthe woman had told Wuong Lang about the\ntreasure cave yesterday. And even the\ndirection she pointed in at the end was\nthe direction of the mine. So, in fact,\nthat woman already knew about this mine.\nIf I hadn't gone into that forest with\nAlpha yesterday and encountered that\nwoman and Wu Fong Lang, then that woman\nwould likely have already led Wu Fong\nLang into the mine. Thinking of this,\nFong Yu couldn't help but feel a chill\nof fear because he had stored all the\nminerals the miners had mined over the\npast few days, as well as the elemental\ncrystals he had exchanged with the rat\nking in the small wooden hut in the\nmine. If other players were to take them\nall, he would suffer a huge loss. No, we\nmust get to the bottom of this. Chapter\n84. Catching a thief by smell. You just\nsaid that this shoe was found this\nmorning? Fongu asked, frowning. Steve\nnodded and replied, \"Yes, I'm pretty\nsure. I heard the noise shortly after\ndawn, so I went out to check.\" Fongu\nbegan to analyze the situation in his\nmind. The female player arrived outside\nthe mine shortly after dawn, indicating\nthat her house should not be far from\nhere and may even be in this forest.\nLogically speaking, the female player\nhad just been attacked by thugs in this\narea yesterday, so she should have a\nfear of this area. Why would she come\nhere so early in the morning? There's\nonly one possibility. There's a benefit\nhere that would make her overcome her\nfear and take the risk. In fact, this\nmine does contain enough profits to\ndrive other players crazy. Not to\nmention the rare gold and silver ores\nand elemental crystals hidden in the\nchests in the wooden house. The hundreds\nof iron ores and hundreds of coals\nsmelted in the five forges outside the\nwooden house alone are enough to drive\nordinary players crazy. In other words,\nthe female player had already entered\nthe mine and discovered the supplies\ninside. At this moment, Fongu remembered\nsomething and picked up the shoes on the\ntable again to examine them. This time,\nhe didn't look at the shoes themselves,\nbut carefully examined the dust that had\naccumulated on the outside of the shoes.\nThe surface of the shoes was covered\nwith grayish black coal ash, while the\nshoes themselves were covered with dark\nbrown gravel. Fong Yu turned his head\nand glanced at the ground near the five\nforging furnaces outside the wooden\nhouse. Because they had been burning for\nseveral days, the ground around them was\ncovered with a layer of gray black coal\nash, and the soil beneath the coal ash\nwas mainly composed of dark brown\ngravel. Therefore, from this\nperspective, the female player had\nindeed entered the mine. Fong Yu then\nsaid to Steve, \"Do you remember how much\niron, ore, and coal were put in the\nforge?\" Steve was slightly taken aback\nupon hearing this and after thinking for\na moment, he nodded and said, \"The iron,\nore, and coal are all full. We put the\nexcess iron, ore, and coal into the\nboxes in the cabin.\" Fong Yu nodded and\nwent to the forging furnace to inspect\neach part. A full forging furnace should\ncontain 100 pieces of iron, ore, and 100\npieces of coal. But when Fong Yu\ncasually checked a forging furnace, he\nfound that it only contained five pieces\nof coal. Five pieces of iron ore and\nfive smelted iron ingots. That means 90\npieces of iron ore and 90 pieces of coal\nwere stolen. The same applies to the\nremaining four forging furnaces. You\nhaven't taken any or from the forge,\nhave you? Funu asked Steve, who was\nstanding next to him. Steve shook his\nhead and said, \"It hasn't been collected\nsince it was full. Look, there are only\na few pieces left inside now.\" Steve was\nstunned when he saw this. he tried to\nexplain. That's impossible. I just put\nall this iron, ore, and coal in this\nmorning. How could it be gone? Funu\nasked again. Are you sure that this\nmorning the shoes were only found at the\nmine entrance and that no one entered\nthe mine? Steve nodded firmly and\nreplied, \"I'm sure.\" Fongu raised an\neyebrow slightly upon hearing this and\nsaid with a rise smile, \"That means\nthere's only one possibility left.\"\n\"What's possible?\" Ryan asked curiously\nfrom the side. That's the owner of that\nshoe. He possessed some kind of\nequipment that could conceal his tracks.\nAnd then he sneaked into the mine and\nstole the ore from the forge without\nyour knowledge. Upon hearing this, Steve\nand Ryan both realized what had\nhappened. Steve in particular was so\nangry that his soul seemed to float\naway. After all, he was in charge of\nguarding the supplies in the mine today,\nand he never expected that so many\nsupplies would be stolen right under his\nnose. All right. All right. Don't worry,\nFong Yu said to Steve, who was angrily\nhovering in midair. I'll go find that\nthief and get those supplies back in a\nbit. Get it back. Upon hearing this,\nSteve immediately floated down from\nmidair and asked with delight. Can you\nfind that despicable thief? Fongu shook\nhis head and laughed. I can't find it,\nbut it can. As he spoke, Fun Yu pointed\nto Alpha, who looked completely\nbewildered, then picked up the pair of\nwomen's Nike shoes and handed them to\nAlpha, saying, \"Following the scent of\nthese shoes, we can find their owner,\nright?\" Alpha realized what was\nhappening, which was a piece of cake for\nhim. So, he put his dog nose into the\nshoes and sniffed them. The next second,\nvomit. Alpha let out a dry heave, then\nstaggered back a few steps and pllopped\ndown on the ground, its face completely\nblank. After it finally came to its\nsenses, it started dry heaving again and\nscratching its nose with its paws. Fa\nwas slightly takenback by Alfa's\nreaction, but then he realized that the\nshoes must smell really bad. Thinking of\nthis, he even subconsciously wanted to\nlower his head and smell it. But\nfortunately, he reacted at the last\nsecond. Even Alpha was nauseated by the\nsmell. So, wouldn't it be suicide for\nhim to lean in and smell it, too? But\nupon closer reflection, it makes sense.\nThe owner of these shoes must have been\nwearing them from the moment they\nentered the survival game through wind\nand rain, floods, and burials. It would\nbe a miracle if they didn't smell\nterrible. 2 minutes later, Alpha finally\nbroke free from the smell, shook its\nhead slightly, and followed the scent\ntowards the outside of the mine. Fongu\nSteve gave him a brief instruction and\nthen followed him with Ryan after he\nreturned. The two followed Alpha as they\ntraversed through the woods. Fong Yu\nalso paid special attention to the\nground along the way and found two sets\nof footprints, one coming from the front\nand one coming back. The coming\nfootprints were the same, while the\nreturning footprints were one deep and\none shallow. It seems that Alpha is\ntracking the correct direction. 5\nminutes later, led by Alpha, Fong Yu and\nRyan walked north for another five or\nsix minutes and finally arrived at the\nedge of the forest. Fong Yu immediately\nspotted a small wooden cabin at the edge\nof the forest. Yes, compared to Fong\nYu&lt;unk&gt;s current 100 m log cabin, this\nlog cabin, which is clearly only the\nlowest level at 30 m, seems pitifully\nsmall. Fongu had Alpha sneak up to the\ncabin and check inside, confirming that\nthe owner was home. then there's no\nproblem. Fongu raised an eyebrow and\nthought to himself. As long as the\nperson hasn't run away, there won't be a\nshortage of supplies. Even if she has\nalready listed all the iron, ore, and\ncoal on the exchange, she should be able\nto get supplies of equal value in\nreturn. She won't lose much. So Fongu\nwalked to the door of the wooden house\nand knocked on the door. Chapter 85. A\nsneak attack from the bushes. Knock,\nknock, knock. As Fong Yu knocked on the\ndoor, a sharp scream came from inside\nthe wooden house. Uh, who? A woman's\nscream came from inside the house. Fong\nYu said calmly, \"I was just passing by\nand asked you for directions.\" Footsteps\ncame from inside the room and then Fongu\nsaw an eye appear through the crack in\nthe door. \"Haha, this woman is quite\ncautious. I just don't know how she got\ncaught by that wolfling yesterday.\"\nAfter peeking at Fong Yu through the\ncrack in the door, the woman recognized\nhim as the man who had rescued her the\nday before. Even so, she didn't open the\ndoor, but said through it, \"I'm not\nfamiliar with this place either. You\nshould ask someone else for directions.\"\nFunu pointed to himself and said, \"You\nshould recognize me, right? I'm the one\nwho saved you yesterday. Look, you\nhaven't even changed your clothes.\"\nAfter a moment of silence, the woman\ninside replied from behind the door.\nYes, I recognized you. I am very\ngrateful to you for saving me yesterday.\nJust a verbal thank you. Then what else\ndo you want? The woman in the room\nsounded annoyed as if she thought Fong\nYu had some improper intentions. Fong Yu\ntook off his pigkin hat, revealing a\ngentle smile, and said, \"Actually, it's\nnothing. I just wanted to ask you\nsomething, and I hope you can answer me\ntruthfully. What is it?\" The woman's\ntone became a little nervous. She seemed\nto realize what Fong Yu wanted to ask.\nFong Yu asked kindly. I lost some things\nabout 400 pieces of iron ore and iron\ningots as well as some coal. I wonder if\nyou've seen them. After a 2-cond\nsilence, the woman inside replied in a\nsomewhat hurried tone. Never seen it.\nHow would I know about something you\nlost? Oh, is that so? Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s\nsmile faded and his expression turned\ncold. He then pulled out a muddy Nike\nwomen's sneaker from behind him and\nsaid, \"But I found a shoe where I lost\nmy things. Have you seen the shoe\nbefore?\" When the woman inside the house\nsaw the shoe in Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s hand\nthrough the crack in the door, she\npanicked. The shoe was, of course, hers.\nShe had tripped and fallen while rushing\nout of the mine after stealing the\ngoods, and the noise had attracted the\nattention of the ghost in the mine, so\nshe didn't have time to pick up the shoe\nand ran back. Surprisingly, the other\nperson actually found their house by\nfollowing the shoe. What should I do?\nWhat should I do? The woman was\ncompletely panicked. She dared not admit\nthat she was the thief because she did\nnot know how this mysterious man would\ntreat her after he found out she was a\nthief. She didn't even know if this man\nwas a player or a native of this world.\nBut the woman clearly remembered how\nthis man in front of her had killed Woo\nFong Lang yesterday. Two fireballs. The\nguy in front of me who looks like a\nbarbarian is actually a powerful\nmagician. Thinking of this, the woman\nbehind the door could only tremble and\ndare not speak. She began to regret it.\nWho would have thought that the things\nin that mind actually belong to this\nguy? Seeing that the woman hadn't\nanswered his question for a long time,\nFongu sighed helplessly and said, \"I'll\ngive you 10 seconds to think it over\nbefore you answer.\" In fact, with Fong\nYu&lt;unk&gt;s current strength, he could\neasily force open the wooden door in\nfront of him, barge in, and force the\nwoman to hand over the supplies. But\ndoing so would be too lowass and would\nmake him look like a bandit. As a\ncultured person, Fong Yu felt that it\nwas better to be polite first and then\nresort to force. If both parties could\nresolve their dispute through\npoliteness, then everyone would be\nhappy. But if he can't handle it, then\nsorry, he'll have to move on to the\nsoldier stage. However, the woman inside\nthe door didn't seem to care about Fong\nYu&lt;unk&gt;s opinion. She didn't reply to\nFong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s words for a long time and\neven started running around the room. A\nmoment later, Fong Yu heard the sound of\nheavy objects scraping against the\nwooden floor coming from inside the\nwooden house. Then he heard a thump as\nif the woman had moved something over\nand blocked the door of the wooden\nhouse.\nSeeing this, Fong Yu shook his head,\nboth amused and exasperated, and asked\nthe woman in the room again, \"What do\nyou mean by this? You're not planning to\nreturn my things, and are going to put\nup a fight?\" At this moment, the woman's\nvoice came from inside the house again.\nBut this time, her tone seemed to have\ngained some confidence, and she spoke\nwith more assertiveness. \"I didn't steal\nanything from anyone. Don't talk\nnonsense.\" Upon hearing this, Fong Yu\nunderstood the woman's attitude. It\nseemed she didn't want to return the\nsupplies. Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s face darkened\ncompletely. He had given this woman\nenough patience, but he didn't expect\nher to be so ungrateful. Well, sorry.\nFong Yu then turned to Ryan, who was\nstanding behind him, and said, \"Ryan,\nbreak down her door for me.\" Upon\nhearing this, Ryan took the rusty iron\naxe from his back and slowly walked\ntowards the door of the wooden house.\nWhen the woman behind the door saw a\nmonster wrapped in burlap and resembling\na mummy carrying an iron axe walking\ntowards her house's door, she panicked\nagain. Bang! Ryan casually raised the\niron axe and swung it lightly. The sharp\nblade cleaved into the door panel,\nsmashing a huge crack in it and\nrevealing the terrified face of the\nwoman inside. \"Ah!\" The woman began to\nscream in terror as she backed away. At\nthis moment, Ryan pulled out the ax\nblade embedded in the door, preparing to\nstrike a second time. Judging from his\nstance, it wouldn't take more than five\nblows for Ryan to completely smash the\nwooden door to pieces. Just then, Alpha,\nwho was sitting on the ground at Fong\nYu&lt;unk&gt;s feet, suddenly stood up and\nstarted barking wildly at the reads that\nwere taller than a person. Fong Yu\nimmediately realized something was wrong\nand looked in the direction Alpha was\nlooking. He immediately saw a sharp\narrow fly out from the reeds, covering a\ndistance of more than 10 meters in the\nblink of an eye, piercing through Ryan's\nhead as he raised his ax to chop down.\nChapter 86 turns out he was just a\nnobody. They actually launched a sneak\nattack. Seeing Ryan's head pierced by a\nbullet, Fongu was furious. This is\nabsolutely unsportsmanlike.\nFortunately, the attacker targeted Ryan,\nnot Fongu. Otherwise, even with the\npigkin hat protecting him, Fongu might\nhave died from that arrow. So, Fong Yu\nimmediately pulled out a wooden shield\nfrom his backpack that looked similar to\na pot lid. It was a bit ugly, but it was\nthe only defensive weapon Fong Yu could\nuse at the moment. Although he could\nmake iron shields, those things were\njust too heavy. As for defensive magic,\nlike the fire shield, that would require\ncasting time, and he wouldn't have\nenough time. After setting up the wooden\nshield, Fong Yu checked the reads along\nthe edge of the shield while retreating\nto Ryan's side, who was lying on the\nground. \"Are you all right?\" Fong Yu\nasked, looking down at her. Ryan shook\nhis head, raised his hand, snapped the\nfeathered arrow off his head, and pulled\nit out. Fong Yu could even see that the\nshaft of the arrow was stained with a\nlot of blood and white brain matter.\n\"Are you really all right?\" Fongu asked\nworriedly. Ryan sat up from the ground\nand replied, \"Don't worry, master. My\nrecovery ability is very strong.\" At\nthat moment, another arrow shot from the\nreeds. This time, the arrow was aimed at\nFong Yu, who was watching Ryan's\ninjuries. The angle was tricky, and the\narrow head was slightly curved, just\nenough to glide past the edge of Fong\nYu's wooden shield and pierce his ribs.\nIf this attack hits, Fongu will be\nseriously injured, even if he doesn't\ndie. Fortunately, Alpha behind Fong Yu\nhad been keeping an eye on the reads and\npounced on them immediately, biting off\nthe arrow. Hearing the whooshing sound\nand the dog's movements, Fong Yu turned\nhis head and saw the feathered arrow in\nAlfa's mouth. His brows furrowed. The\nopponent was very cautious, hiding in\nthe reads and refusing to show himself.\nMoreover, every arrow he shot was very\naccurate. He seemed to be a master. At\nthis moment, Fongu recalled how the\nwoman in the house had suddenly become\nassertive during their conversation. If\nhe wasn't mistaken, the guy in the\nbushes must be a helper that the woman\nin the house had brought over. They\nattacked without asking any questions,\nand every arrow was deadly. That's\nruthless. Since you're so ruthless,\ndon't blame me for being merciless.\nLooking at the reads swaying in the\nbreeze, Fongu felt a headache coming on.\nThese grassy burrows were the most\ndisgusting. When Alpha tried to rush\ninto the reads, Fongu stopped him and\nbegan chanting the incantation for a\nfireball. I'll burn this whole patch of\ngrass down. Where do you think you're\ngoing to hide? Soon, Fongu summoned a\nfireball and threw it into the bushes.\nBut just then, another arrow flew out of\nthe bushes, and the arrow head seemed to\nbe flashing with a white light. The next\nsecond, the arrow struck the fireball in\nmidair, and with a loud bang, the\nfireball exploded. It's a magic slaying\narrow. Ryan said it can block the fusion\nof magic power and magical elements.\nFireball won't work on him. Upon hearing\nthis, Fongu frowned. He hadn't expected\nthe other party to be a marksman with\nskills. He guessed that the marksman had\nswitched to another class. This is\ndifficult. If you don't go in, he'll\nlaunch a sneak attack every now and\nthen. If you do go in, who knows what\ntraps are waiting for him in that reed\nbed. Maybe as soon as you walk in, three\nbrothers from the bushes will jump out.\nHey buddy, hiding in the bushes. Come\nout and have a chat. Fong you try to get\nthe other guy out of the reads. However,\nhalf a minute later, the other party did\nnot show up, seemingly intending to play\nit safe. At this moment, Ryan finally\nrecovered, picked up the iron axe, and\nstood up from the ground. He glanced\ncoldly in the direction of the reads,\nand walked towards them. Be careful\nbecause Ryan was immortal. Fongu did not\nstop him. Ryan nodded slightly, and sure\nenough, new arrows flew out of the reeds\nand shot towards him. However, Ryan did\nnot dodge at all, nor did he bother to\nuse his iron ax to block them, letting\nseveral arrows pierce his body. It\nwasn't until an arrow emitting a white\nlight shot towards him that Ryan raised\nhis iron ax to block it. This arrow,\nwhich possessed anti-agic properties,\ncould still cause him some damage. Soon,\nRyan took his axe and walked into the\nreeds. A moment later, the reeds began\nto shake violently, and soon a man's\nscream rang out. A while later, Fong Yu\nsaw Ryan dragging a man dressed in\nanimal skin out of the bushes, one leg\ndragged by one hand. And on Ryan's two\ncalves, there were also two iron animal\ntraps embedded in them. Damn, that old\ncoin really did set a trap in the\nbushes. Fun, you cursed. thankful that\nRyan was immortal. If it were him or\nAlpha who went in, the consequences\nwould be unimaginable. Soon, Ryan\ndragged the bloodcovered man to Fong Yu\nand then held the ax blade to the man's\nneck. He quite sensible. Fong Yu glanced\nat Ryan and laughed. You even know to\ncapture them alive. So, Fongu put down\nthe wooden shield in his hand and\ncarefully examined the man on the\nground. The man on the ground was\nunconscious. His left wrist was bent at\nan odd angle and it looked like it was\nbroken. His right hand was in even worse\nshape. His shoulder looked like it had\nbeen cleaved by an ax blade with the\nflesh turned outward and the broken bone\nclearly visible. Only a little flesh was\nstill holding it together and blood was\nspurting out from time to time. Judging\nfrom these injuries, this guy is\nprobably not going to make it. Funu felt\nno pity for him. After all, the guy's\nprevious two arrows were aimed at Ryan\nand his own vital points. If Ryan hadn't\nbeen immortal, those arrows would have\nkilled him on the spot. Fongu was well\naware that being merciful to the enemy\nwas being cruel to oneself. So, Fong Yu\ntook a bucket of water out of his\nbackpack and poured it on the man's\nface, intending to ask him about the\nsituation before he died. Splash! After\na bucket of water was poured in, the man\non the ground was choked awake. Fong Yu\nbent down, stared at the man on the\nground, and asked, \"Who are you? Why did\nyou ambush me?\" The man glanced weakly\nat Fong Yu, then turned to look at Ryan,\nwho was prying open the animal trap on\nhis leg. He even glanced at the bloody\nhole in Ryan&lt;unk&gt;s head where an arrow\nhad pierced through him and gritted his\nteeth as he asked, \"What kind of\nmonsters are you?\" \"Hey, you're really\nlacking intact,\" Funu said sternly,\nkicking the man's body. \"Now it's my\nturn to ask you a question.\" The man\nturned to look at Fong Yu, gritting his\nteeth and enduring the pain as he said,\n\"Do you know who I am?\" \"Oh, who are\nyou?\" The man glared at Fong Yu and\nshouted, \"I am Chun Tin Xiang, the\nsecond in command of the Dong Sean\ngang.\" \"Oh, Fongu raised an eyebrow\nslightly and smiled contemptuously. So,\nyou're just a nobody. You dare mess with\nthe Dong Xing gang? You're dead. Dong\nXan Society.\" Fongu had heard of this\nDong Shan guild before. It seemed to be\na newly emerged organization in the\ndistrict these past few days, claiming\nto be the largest player group in the\nentire district and advertising and\nrecruiting members in the regional chat\nchannel every day. The leader of this\nDong Sean gang seems to be a player\nnamed Sidu Haan, who is said to be the\nboss of a certain street in Cowoon. To\nbe fair, that guy was lucky. Dozens of\nhis henchmen were also pulled into the\ngame along with him. So under Situ\nHanan's leadership, those gangsters got\ntogether and started a gang called Dong\nSean. So what if you're from Dong Sean?\nFunu sneered. I'm from Red Star. Well,\ndare to say your name? The man on the\nground said through gritted teeth,\nenduring the excruciating pain. And then\nwhat? Notify all of you in Dong to hunt\nme down? Do you think I'm stupid? Fong\nyou sneered. You idiot. You're about to\ndie and you're still acting tough. Just\nthen, a light mocking laugh with a\nstrong cowoon accent came from the woods\nnot far away. You bastard. You've got\nquite the nerve. You don't think you can\ntake Tong Sing seriously, huh? Fong Yu\nlooked in the direction of the sound and\nsaw more than a dozen figures emerging\nfrom the woods one after another.\nChapter 87. Kill this bastard. Fong Yu\nnarrowed his eyes when he saw the group\nof players who called themselves Dong\nSean emerge from the woods. He finally\nunderstood why the woman in the house\nhad been stubbornly refusing to return\nthe supplies. It turned out she had\nfound a powerful backer. Fun guess\ncorrectly. In fact, the woman in the\nroom had gone through the chat channels\nlast night and decided to join the Dong\nSeong Guild, which claimed to have over\na thousand members and was the largest\nplayer group in the entire region.\nBecause the Dong Seong Society has\nalready established a settlement, living\nthere is definitely much safer than\nbeing alone in this desolate wilderness.\nHowever, when the woman contacted the\nadministrator of the Dong Seong Society,\nthe administrator said that joining the\nDong Seong Society was free. But if she\nwanted to move to the Dong Seong\nSociety's settlement and receive the\nsociety's protection, she had to pay for\nsupplies worth 500 wood. 500 pieces of\nwood is equivalent to 50 trees. For a\nwoman, it would take at least two days\nto chop down enough trees to accumulate\nthat much. However, Wuong Lang had\nalready looted all her supplies\nyesterday, so she couldn't afford that\nmany. Therefore, she decided to take a\ngamble and venture into the haunted\nabandoned mine to see if she could find\nanything of value. Just the day before\nyesterday, she found a bronze treasure\nchest and opened it which contained an\ninvisibility cloak. Because she kept it\nat home, Wuon Lang was able to keep it.\nSo early this morning, she put on an\ninvisibility cloak and entered the\nhaunted mine. After dodging a terrifying\nghost, she took more than 400 pieces of\niron ore, iron ingots, and coal from the\nfive forging furnaces in the mine. The\ncurrent price is about 15 pieces of wood\nfor one piece of iron ore. The value of\njust over 400 pieces of iron ore is over\n6,000. For a woman, this is undoubtedly\na huge fortune that she never dared to\ndream of before. The woman thought she\nhad struck it lucky, but her joy turned\nto sorrow as she lost a shoe while\nfleeing. Little did she know that the\nlost shoe would foreshadow her tragic\nend. The Dong Sean Society settlement\nwas quite far from here. The woman\nwanted the Dong Sean Society to send\nsome people to pick her up and take her\nto the settlement since there was still\na five or 6 km distance to travel. And\nit was hard to say what would happen if\nthey encountered jackals or tigers. The\nDong Sean Society originally didn't want\nto go through all this trouble, but the\nwoman said there was a mine here that\nthey could explore together. When Sidu\nHaan, the leader of the Dong Shen gang,\nheard that someone had discovered a\nmine, he immediately became interested\nand personally led a team to the woman's\nlocation to investigate. And so this\nscene unfolded before our eyes. Fongu\nremained calm as more than a dozen\nplayers surrounded him. He glanced\naround and saw that there were 13 people\nin total. Judging from their attire,\nonly the three leaders were wearing\ncomplete sets of wild boar armor and\ncarrying iron long swords and knives, so\nthey seemed to have some skill. The\nothers were still wearing linen clothes,\nand they were carrying weapons such as\nwooden sticks, wooden spears, and stone\naxes. Fongu was also carefully observing\nhis surroundings out of the corner of\nhis eye. The group of Dong Sean Gang\nmembers had come out of the woods\ndirectly in front of him and the reads\non his right were swaying irregularly\nindicating that there were also people\nlying in ambush there. Even one or two\nsuspicious figures had appeared in the\nwoods on his left. In other words, the\ntotal number of the opposing team should\nbe around 20 and I am already surrounded\nby three people with my escape route\nabout to be cut off. It seems that the\nother group is smarter and more cautious\nthan I imagined. Even when faced with\nonly two people and a dog, they still\nmanaged to use tactics of flanking\nmaneuvers and encirclement, they are not\nthe kind of rabble I had imagined. But\nFong Yu wasn't flustered at all because\nthe other party didn't know that Ryan\nwas a powerful warrior with an immortal\nbody. Nor did they know that Alpha was a\nhellhound with demon blood. And even\nless did they know that Fong Yu was a\nmagician who practiced both magic and\nmonsters, carrying dozens of explosives\nin his backpack. Meanwhile, the members\nof the Dong Sean gang opposite them\ncompleted their encirclement and pressed\ncloser to Fong Yu step by step. Leading\nthe way was Situ Haan, the leader of\nDong Sean. He was wearing a complete set\nof wild boar armor and carrying a\ntwo-handed broadsword on his back. He\nhad already noticed the man lying on the\nground, and when he saw the man's\nhorrific condition, his face contorted\nwith rage. He glared at Fong Yu and\nshouted, \"You dare to touch\nsomeone from Dong Sean.\" Fong Yu replied\ncalmly. He brought it upon himself. Fong\nYu&lt;unk&gt;s words immediately enraged Sidu\nHaan. He roared, drew his broadsword\nfrom his back, and yelled, \"Fuck your\nmother. You're asking for death,\nbrothers. Get him! Kill this bastard!\"\nChapter 8. Growing bigger and stronger,\ncreating new glory. Facing the swarming\nenemies rushing towards him, Fong Yu\ncalmly applied a pre- battle buff to\nhimself. After several days of training,\nhe was able to instantly cast low-level\nmagic. After all, the chanting of\nlow-level magic usually only involves a\nfew notes, and with practice, one can\neasily recite them, though this only\napplies to the few magic skills he is\nmore familiar with. Soon, a layer of\nblue water runes covered Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s\nskin. Golden runes appeared on his bore\narmor, and a crimson fire shield rose\naround him. All defensive skills\nactivated. Immediately, two orange\nfireballs appeared in Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s\nhands. Ryan, standing to the side, had\nalready gripped his iron ax tightly, his\nback slightly arched, and he had entered\nbattle mode. Alpha had also entered\ntransformation mode, his yellow hair\nquickly turning red and his eyes\ngleaming with a fierce crimson light.\nAll pre-war preparations are complete.\nUpon seeing this, Situ Houndan's eyes\nwidened, and he immediately stopped in\nhis tracks, shouting, \"Stop!\" He then\nraised his hand to stop his teammate's\nattack and stared into thought as he\nlooked at the multicolored magical light\nemanating from Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s body. If\nI'm not mistaken, the other party should\nbe a mage, and a mage who knows several\ntypes of magic. He had specifically\nlooked up the requirements for becoming\na mage. It required elemental affinity.\nTo learn a magic system, one needed to\nhave affinity for that systems elements.\nThis meant that the mage in front of him\nhad affinity for several elements.\nThat's a bit scary. In addition, there's\na strangely shaped mummy wielding an\niron axe and a ferocious dog that can\ntransform. It's clear at a glance that\nthese are no ordinary creatures. With\nthis level of fighting strength, if a\nreal battle were to break out, the\noutcome would be difficult to predict.\nEven if we were to defeat them with our\nnumerical advantage, the result would\nlikely be a pirick victory. Putting\neverything else aside, the guy lying on\nthe ground with both arms severed was\nthe second in command of the Dong Sean\ngang, whose fighting strength was even\nabove that of Situ Haan. Yet, he was\ndefeated by him, and the other party was\nstill unharmed. This made Situ Hanan\nthink twice. Moreover, the 20 henchmen\nwho came with Sidu Hanan this time were\nall his subordinates whom he knew in\nreal life, and they were considered his\nown loyal followers. If most of them\nwere lost here, it would undoubtedly be\na huge loss for him, and it would be\ndifficult for him to keep a firm grip on\nthe gang after returning. So after\nweighing the pros and cons, Sidu Hanan\nput away his playful expression and\nlooked at Fong Yu seriously saying,\n\"Handsome, if I'm not mistaken, you\nshould be a player, right? And a mage at\nthat.\" And then Fongu replied coldly.\nUpon hearing this, Situ Hanan\nimmediately burst into laughter, \"Ha,\nthen it's a misunderstanding.\" With\nthat, Situ Hanan planted the broadsword\nin his hand into the ground and turned\nto signal his underlings behind him to\nput away their weapons as well.\nImmediately afterward, Situ Haan smiled\nand said to Fong Yu, \"Since we're&lt;unk&gt;\nall players, then we're&lt;unk&gt; all\nbrothers? How can brothers fight and\nkill each other? Don't you agree? What\nexactly are you trying to say?\" Fong Yu\nasked, frowning. He actually, I didn't\nmean anything by it. I just wanted to\nask if you'd be interested in developing\nyour career in Dong Sean. Situ Hanan put\non what he thought was a sincere\nexpression and said, \"I'm Sidu Haan, the\npresident of the Dong Sean gang. If\nyou're willing to come to Dong Xang, I\ncan guarantee you'll be my brother for\nlife.\" Just then, the door of the wooden\nhouse next to them suddenly opened and\neveryone saw a woman run quickly to Sidu\nHaan, kneel down, hug Sidu Hanan's leg,\nand cry with tears streaming down her\nface, saying, \"Brother Hanan, you have\nto save me. That pervert, he's going to\nkill me. That mine is his. He must have\na lot of supplies. Kill him. Kill him\nnow.\" The woman's behavior made Sidu\nHoundan feel somewhat embarrassed. Are\nyour eyes on your butt? I was trying to\nwin him over and you just told me to\nkill him. If the other side were that\neasy to kill, I would have already done\nit. Do you need to tell me? Seeing this,\nFong Youu on the other side naturally\nwouldn't let this woman smear him like\nthis. He sneered. Huh? You I\nsaved you yesterday and instead of being\ngrateful, you stole my things today and\nrefused to admit it and even tried to\naccuse me of being a pervert. How can\nyour heart be so black? Situ Hanan\nwasn't stupid. On the contrary, anyone\nwho could sit in the top position was\nextremely shrewd. After hearing Fong\nYu&lt;unk&gt;s words, he immediately\nunderstood the ins and outs of the\nmatter. He rolled his eyes, raised his\nhand, and slapped the woman hard across\nthe face. \"Smack!\" \"Oh!\" The woman\nscreamed and collapsed to the side,\nclutching her face. She looked at Sidu\nHaan with a puzzled expression, about to\nask him why he hit her. But Sidu Haan\nimmediately kicked her in the chest,\nknocking her to the ground. Damn it, you\nYou said some native monster\nblocked your door and asked us to rescue\nyou. But it turns out you did something\nwrong and they came after you. And you\neven caused one of my brothers to be\nseriously injured. Eat After\nsaying that, Situ Hanan waved his hand\nslightly and several of his men stepped\nforward and lifted the woman on the\nground. The woman tried to struggle and\nexplain but was knocked unconscious.\n\"Give this girl to that brother and let\nhim do whatever he wants with her,\" Sidu\nHaan said. So his henchmen dragged the\nwoman to Fong Yu and threw her on the\nground. \"What do you mean by this?\" Fong\nYu looked at the woman on the ground and\nasked with a frown. Sidu Hanan laughed\nand said, \"What era are we living in\nnow? The old ways of fighting and\nkilling are outdated. We who are in the\nbusiness of life value harmony above all\nelse.\" As he spoke, Situ Haan took two\nsteps forward, lowered his posture, and\nsaid to Fong Yu, \"Well, as long as you\ncome to Dong X, we're all brothers.\nWhat's mine is yours. Let's work\ntogether to make it bigger and stronger\nand create new glories.\" Chapter 89.\nEliminating the weeds at the root. He\nhe. So, it's because they see how\npowerful they are and want to win them\nover. Fong Yu sneered inwardly. Of\ncourse, he would never go to this damn\nDong Shing Gang because he wouldn't\nbelieve a single word of Situ Han's\nnonsense. Fong Yu kicked the man lying\non the ground, barely alive, and looked\nat Sidu Haan, saying, \"Hey, this guy on\nthe ground says he's the second in\ncommand of your Dong Sean gang. So, he\nshould be one of your brothers who\nrisked their lives for you, right?\nYou're not even going to care about him\nin this miserable state, and you still\nwant to recruit me, who injured him like\nthis, into your gang? Is this how you\ntreat your own brothers who risked their\nlives for you?\" Upon hearing this, Situ\nHaan's henchmen along with the dozen or\nso others surrounding Fong Yu all turned\nto look at Sidu Hanan, their eyes\nrevealing a hint of dissatisfaction. For\nthese gangsters, loyalty is paramount,\nand their boss's actions were indeed\nexcessive. This was exactly what Fong Yu\nwanted to achieve. A simple divisive\ntactic to alienate these guys from Sidu\nHanan, making them easier to deal with\nlater. Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s words finally made\nSitu Haan's face fall completely. He\nrealized that the magician on the other\nside had no intention of joining them at\nall. Situ Hanan sneered and said, \"Kid,\nI advise you not to be ungrateful. In\nthis world, you need power and\nconnections. One person can't amount to\nanything.\" Fong Yu curled his lip and\nsaid disdainfully, \"Useless trash, just\ntoo talkative.\" Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s words were\ntantamount to a slap in the face to Sidu\nHanan. Enraged, Sidu Haan could no\nlonger pretend or hold back. He glared\nfiercely at Fong Yu and shouted, \"Kill\nhim for me.\" So, the henchmen around him\nraised their weapons again and charged\nat Fong Yu. However, before the first\nhenchmen could even get within 5 m of\nFong Yu, he was blocked by a strangely\nshaped mummy. Just as the henchman was\nabout to use the stone axe in his hand\nto chop at the mummy in front of him.\nThe mummy struck first and chopped him\non the top of his head with the axe.\nHuh? The henchman let out a scream, but\nbefore his scream could even finish, the\nmummy had already pulled the axe from\nthe henchman's skull and chopped it down\non the skull of another henchman who was\ncharging at him. At the same time, two\nhenchmen who rushed over from the other\nside were also blocked by a wolf hound\nwith red fur. When they saw the red\nlight flashing in the wolf hounds eyes,\nas well as its sharp fangs and claws,\nthe two henchmen looked at each other,\nswallowed hard, and took two steps back.\nThey were scared and wanted to turn\naround and run away. But the red-haired\nwolf hound didn't seem to intend to give\nthe two henchmen a chance to escape.\nWith a leap, it pounced on the back of\none of the henchmen, opened its huge\nmouth, and bit the henchmen's nape. With\na crack sound, the henchmen with a\nbroken spine collapsed to the ground,\nconvulsing and howling in agony. At that\nmoment, Alfa released his grip and\nchased after the remaining henchmen.\nRyan and Alpha could only hold off\nenemies from two directions. Although\nFong Yu had the wooden house behind him\nto protect him from one direction, three\nenemies from another direction still\nmanaged to get close to him. However,\nwhat greeted the three of them was two\nfireballs the size of basketballs. These\nthree henchmen were also fighting a\nmagician for the first time. They\nthought that as long as they could dodge\nthe fireballs with their agility and\nthen rush in, they could kill the\nmagician with a flurry of swords.\nHowever, they made the same mistake as\nWuong Lang. They didn't know that the\nfireballs trajectory was controlled by\nmental power. Therefore, under Fong Yu's\ncontrol, the two fireballs accurately\nstruck the two henchmen who tried to\ndodge to the side. Sparks flew\neverywhere, and the two men quickly\nbecame two burning figures, screaming\nwildly and running around in all\ndirections. After a brief moment of\nshock, the last remaining henchman\nimmediately raised his stone ax and\nswung it at Fong Yu, who was standing\nright in front of him. In Maai's view,\nit takes time for a magician to cast a\nspell, and magicians are generally very\nweak. As long as his axe hits the\nmagician, the magician will surely die.\nHowever, the next second, the henchman\nsaw the magician in front of him pull\nout an iron axe and swung it at him.\nBang! A dull thud of an ax blade\npiercing flesh rang out. Fong Yu's iron\naxe was now embedded in the chest of the\nlast henchman. The henchman looked down\nat the axe in his chest in disbelief.\nHis expression first showing surprise,\nthen slowly turning into terror and\nfinally into helpless despair.\nImmediately, the last henchman fell to\nthe ground. At this moment, Funu glanced\naround. He had killed three himself.\nAlpha had killed five, and Ryan had\nkilled the most, a total of nine.\nMoreover, every ax blow was aimed at the\ntop of the head, neck, heart, or other\nsuch places, killing them instantly. At\nthis moment, only Situ Houndan and his\ntwo men remained in the room. They were\nstill alive because they had not rushed\nover. Fongu raised his hand and pulled\nout the iron axe embedded in the corpse.\nHe looked at the three people, Situ\nHoundan and his companions, who were\nstaring in disbelief not far away. He\ntook a breath and said, \"You sent your\nunderlings to their deaths, but you\nchickenened out in the back. Is this\nwhat you're good for as a boss?\" As he\nspoke, Fongu gave Alpha and Ryan a look,\nand the two of them and the dog\nsurrounded Sidu Hanan and his two\ncompanions. At this moment, Sidu Hanan\nwas no longer the arrogant man he had\nbeen before. He looked at the corpses\nscattered on the ground, then at the two\nmen and a dog slowly walking towards\nhim. His heart trembled, and only one\nthought occupied his mind. \"Run!\" Situ\nHoundan roared and before his two\nhenchmen could react, turned and rushed\ninto the woods behind him. Seeing that\ntheir boss had run away, the two\nhenchmen naturally couldn't stay here to\nface such a terrifying enemy. So, they\nalso turned and ran into the woods\nimmediately. Seeing the three fleeing\npeople, Fun Yu breathed a sigh of\nrelief. He knew that this encounter was\nover and that his side had won a\ncomplete victory. The reason they were\nable to win so easily was largely due to\nthe opponent underestimating them. Their\nthree strongest fighters had been hiding\nin the back watching the show. If the\nthree fully armed warriors led by Sidu\nHanan had also attacked together, the\noutcome would have been very different.\nFongu glanced at the unconscious woman\non the ground and said to Ryan and\nAlpha, \"You two go after them and make\nsure to eliminate them completely.\" Ryan\nand Alpha both nodded and followed the\nthree men into the woods. Fong Yu then\nwent to the unconscious woman's side and\nbegan to search her body. Chapter 90.\nLooting. Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s reason for\ngroping women was not to take advantage\nof them, but to search for something.\nIt's the same thing that can help a\nwoman hide her tracks and enter the mine\nwithout being discovered by Ghost Steve.\nAfter some searching, Fong Yu finally\ndiscovered something unusual in the\nwoman's lower back. Her waistband was\nbulging, and at first glance, there\nseemed to be a gap between her skin and\nthe waistband. It wasn't until Fong Yu\nreached in and touched it that he\nrealized there seemed to be a piece of\nfabric that was invisible to the naked\neye, but could be felt in this visible\ngap. So he pulled the fabric out. Fongu\nheld it in his hand and touched it. The\ntexture was very smooth, like touching\nsilk. Then he shook it slightly and\ndiscovered that the other side of the\nfabric was a visible grayish white\ncolor. Judging from the shape, it seemed\nto be a cloak. Invisibility cloak blew a\nlightweight and soft cloak woven from\nthe skin of magical chameleons. It\noffers some warmth, but more\nimportantly, it can change color to\nblend into its surroundings, achieving\ninvisibility. It is a relatively rare\nitem. After seeing the game assistant\ndescription, Fongu smiled slightly. Sure\nenough, this woman must have used it to\nhide her identity. The blue rare quality\ncloak, although its only function is to\nmake one invisible, can be life-saving\nin certain special situations, so Fongu\nnaturally accepted it. Fong Yu felt no\nguilt whatsoever about taking the\ninvisibility cloak for free. The woman\nin front of him had truly shown the\nugliest side of repaying kindness with\nenmity and betraying righteousness for\npersonal gain. After confirming that the\nwoman had nothing of value on her, Fongu\npicked up an ax and gently slashed her\nneck, cutting the artery and causing a\nlarge amount of blood to flow out. If\nthis woman had only stolen his things,\nFongu might have spared her life. But\nafter she ran out the door, she actually\ntried to instigate Sidu Houndan to kill\nhim. Fong Yu couldn't find a reason to\nlet such an ungrateful person, someone\nwho would turn on their benefactor at\nany moment, live. Letting her die\npeacefully in her sleep was Fong\nYu&lt;unk&gt;s final act of mercy towards her.\nImmediately, Fong Yu entered the woman's\nwooden house to search for supplies. She\nhadn't brought a backpack when she came\nout, so the supplies should all be\ninside the house. Sure enough, after\nsearching, Fong Yu quickly found the\nwoman's backpack in the bedroom of the\nwooden house. He took out more than 300\niron ingots, more than 100 iron ore, and\nmore than 100 pieces of coal from it.\nAfter a quick calculation, he realized\nthat a few dozen pieces of iron or were\nmissing. Upon further thought, he\nguessed that they must have given them\nto the Dong Shung gang, otherwise they\nwouldn't have come all the way to help\nher. Adhering to the principle of not\nbeing taken advantage of, Fongu looted\neverything he could from the cabin, even\ntaking all the charcoal from the\nfireplace, which barely made up for the\nvalue of the dozens of iron or pieces he\nhad lost. After looting the supplies in\nthe cabin, Fongu went outside and looked\nat the corpses scattered on the ground.\nA strange sense of satisfaction arose in\nhis heart, especially when he saw the\nvicious woman who was completely dead.\nHe even felt a sense of pleasure that\nmade him want to burst out laughing. He\nknew that this was actually the dark\nside hidden in his heart or rather the\nviolent side which made people feel\nrelaxed and happy after killing and\ndestroying. In fact, everyone has a\nsimilar dark and violent side. But it is\nburied deep in their hearts due to the\nconstraints of the law and morality. But\nonce they arrive in this world of\nsurvival without the constraints of\nmorality and law coupled with the\ninstinct for survival, the dark and\nviolent side of almost everyone will\ngradually emerge. And Fong Yu is no\nexception. From initially killing the\nwild boar spider to later killing the\ncrypt dwarf and then killing Wu Fong\nLang yesterday and then killing three\nmore players today, Fong Yu's dark and\nviolent side has gradually been\nawakened. Just then, the sky suddenly\ndarkened. Boom! A flash of lightning\nstreaked across the gloomy sky, and Fong\nYu was slightly jolted, suddenly\nrealizing that something seemed wrong\nwith his condition. A short while later,\na torrential downpour began. Washed by\nthe rain, the blood beneath the corpses\nslowly gathered into a crimson stream,\nflowing gently towards the low-lying\nreed beds. The dense rain also quickly\ndiluted the stench of blood. Fong Yu\nlooked at the red stream on the ground,\nthen slowly walked out from under the\neaves of the wooden house into the\ndownpour, letting the cold autumn rain\nwash over his body. Jingle's reminder\nmade him realize where he had gone\nwrong, his mindset. He was neither a\nbenevolent saint nor a bloodthirsty\nmonster. He was just an ordinary\nnovelist. He knew that in order to\nsurvive, and for his own benefit, he had\nto kill those who deserve to die. But\ndeep down, he still abhored killing. He\nwanted to use the cold rain to\nextinguish the murderous urge that had\njust risen in his heart and to wash away\nthe blood that had stained his body\nbecause he knew that if he didn't\ncontrol the murderous urge in his heart\nin time, he would soon degenerate into a\nbloodthirsty devil who regarded human\nlife as worthless due to excessive\nkilling in this world of survival. That\nwas not what he hoped to see, nor was it\nthe life he wanted. And so Funyu stood\nin the downpour for a long time until\nRyan and Alpha returned to his side.\nRyan and Alfa were both curious as to\nwhy their master was standing in the\nrain, but they didn't disturb him. They\nsimply stood quietly beside him. After a\nlong while, the downpour finally\nsubsided. Fongu wiped the rain off his\nface and looked at Ryan and Alpha. They\nkilled all three of them. Ryan and Alpha\nnodded together. Ryan stepped aside and\npointed behind him where Fong Yu saw\nthree corpses led by Sidu Haan lying\nthere. Surprisingly, Ryan even brought\nback the body. He handled the matter\nvery well. Fong Yu smiled slightly and\nnodded, saying, \"Thank you.\" Upon\nhearing this, Ryan shily raised his hand\nand scratched his head while Alpha stuck\nout his tongue, looking quite happy.\nFong Yu then searched all the corpses on\nthe ground, taking all the supplies from\ntheir backpacks, as well as the armor\nand weapons from the three who escaped\nlast, including Sidu Hanan. The richest\nitem was naturally Situ Haan's backpack.\nThis guy's backpack was also made of\npigkin and was almost completely stuffed\nfull. There were more than 5,000 pieces\nof wood alone, and other materials such\nas gravel, vines, and iron ingots\ntotaled over a thousand. However, there\nwere no valuable materials. The highest\ngrade items were only six pieces of\nmyithil ore and a dozen pieces of gold\nore. Actually, there are quite a few of\nthese supplies. They were all scavenged\nby the Dong Shung Society from the\nplayers who joined their settlement. The\ntotal value of these supplies exceeds\n20,000 pieces of wood. Overall, the\noperation to catch the thief ended very\nwell. Not only were the lost items\nrecovered, but they also made a\nconsiderable profit, making it a very\nfruitful endeavor. Chapter 91A, a\ncomplete solution for destroying the\ncorpse. Because of the limited capacity\nof his backpack, Fong Yu put all the\nequipment he had taken from the corpses\ninto the exchange for consignment.\nHowever, the exchange only had 15 slots.\nSo, in order to get rid of them as soon\nas possible, he marked all the items\nthat couldn't fit in the backpack at 50%\noff. But then, Fongu thought that it\nwould be better to benefit his own fans\nin his support group than to let others\nbenefit. So, he told the fans in the\nsupport group to hurry up and grab it in\nthe exchange. This was his way of giving\nback to his fans. After dealing with all\nthe supplies on the bodies and in their\nbackpacks, an hour had passed. Fongu\nlooked at the corpses one last time and\nhesitated whether to burn them all. But\nthen Ryan walked up to Fong Yu, pointed\nto the corpses on the ground, and said,\n\"Master, should we make them your\nsoldiers?\" \"Huh, soldiers?\" Fongu raised\nan eyebrow, asking with a surprised\nlook, \"What do you mean?\" Ryan pointed\nto himself and replied, \"I can absorb\nthe life force of living beings to kill\nthem, and I can also give the dead life\nforce to revive them.\" Upon hearing\nthis, Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s eyes widened\nimmediately. Holy crap. Fong Yu\nexclaimed excitedly after uttering the\nphrase. You have this skill too. Ryan\nnodded and said, \"So, do you need it?\"\nAfter they are resurrected, will they\nremember what happened before they were\nalive? \"What about their loyalty?\" Funu\nimmediately thought of the core issue.\nRyan shook his head and said, \"You don't\nneed to worry about that. I only\nresurrected the bodies. Even after they\nare resurrected, they will only be in a\nstate of mindless walking corpses and\nwill not have any memories. After\nlistening, Fong Yu asked with a\nconflicted expression. Uh, doesn't that\nmean zombies? Zombies? What are those?\nRyan tilted his head, not quite\nunderstanding. Never mind, it's nothing.\nFongu waved his hand and said, \"Since\nthey're just walking corpses after being\nresurrected, what's the point of them\nbeing resurrected? You can have them\npatrol around your manor or perform some\nsimple tasks such as cutting down trees\nor mining, Ryan explained. My abilities\nhaven't fully recovered yet, so I can\nonly have them do these simple things.\nCutting down trees and mining. Upon\nhearing this, Fongu immediately perked\nup. This was practically free labor.\nThis is a good idea. Fongu then agreed\nto Ryan's idea. Ryan approached the\ncorpse of the hunter who had attacked\nhim, stretched out a hand, tore off the\nburlap covering his hand, revealing a\npalm interwoven with fascia and bright\nred muscle. Immediately, a dark green\nmist emanated from his palm and quickly\nseeped into the corpse's seven\norififices. A few dozen seconds later,\nthe hunter's corpse suddenly began to\ntremble as if it were about to rise from\nthe dead. Strictly speaking, this seems\nto be what you call a zombie coming back\nto life. Soon, the hunter's corpse\nstopped trembling, then suddenly sat up\nfrom the ground, stared blankly at Ryan\nbeside him and called out, \"Master.\"\nRyan nodded and reached out to touch the\nhunter's severed right shoulder again.\nAnother flash of green light appeared,\nand the hunter's right arm, which had\nbeen cut by the ax blade and was only\nconnected by skin and flesh,\nmiraculously began to regenerate little\nby little. \"Hongu raised his eyebrows\nupon seeing this.\" \"Ryan, you know\nhealing magic and such amazing healing\nmagic at that. You can even regenerate\nsevered limbs.\" Ryan shook his head and\nexplained, \"I can only use this\nrestoration spell on dead corpses. But\nif I use it on living creatures, their\nflesh will be corroded by this power.\"\nFongu was truly amazed this time. There\nwas actually a healing technique that\ncould only be used on corpses. In no\ntime, Ryan had healed the fractures in\nthe dead hunter's right shoulder and\nleft wrist. He looked almost the same as\nwhen he was alive, except that he was a\nlittle pale. His eyes were a little dull\nand his walking posture was a little\nstiff. Otherwise, he was fine. So, you\nwatched as Ryan resurrected the corpses\non the ground one by one and then\ntreated their injuries. Actually,\ntreatment isn't necessary, Ryan\nexplained. But I'm worried you might not\nbe able to accept their appearance.\nThat's true. Among the corpses here, the\none with the most beautiful death was\nprobably the player who was first\nchopped in the chest by Fong Yu with an\naxe. Those who died at Ryan's hands were\nbasically in a state where their skulls\nwere blown open and tofu pudding was\nsplattered everywhere. Those who died at\nAlfa's hands were also basically bitten\nto a bloody pulp. If those kinds of\ncorpses were to patrol around his manor,\nFunu himself would probably be scared\ninto a nervous breakdown. Even though\nRyan restored the wounds on the corpses\none by one, Fong Yu still didn't want\nthese walking corpses to roam around his\nmanor. So, he had a new idea. Could we\nlet them go into the mines to dig for or\nRyan nodded and said, \"There shouldn't\nbe any problem. I'll make them follow\nthe orders of the mind ghosts.\" Upon\nhearing this, Fongu was overjoyed. This\nmeant that the number of miners in the\nmine had increased from 10 ghosts to 10\nghosts and 21 zombies. Naturally, the\nmining efficiency would also increase\nsignificantly. Do these zombies need\nregular food or anything? Fongu asked\nagain since they are different from\nghosts and their corpses will rot over\ntime. Ryan nodded and replied, \"If they\ndon't eat fresh flesh and blood, they\nwill turn back into corpses and\ncompletely decompose after 3 days. I\nwill send them some fresh flesh and\nblood every 2 days. So, please don't\nworry, master.\" Then there's one last\nquestion, Fongu added. Where do these\npeople's souls go after they die? Will\nthey become ghosts and come back to\nhaunt me for revenge? Ryan nodded again.\nSome of these people have decent soul\npower and may become wandering spirits\ntonight. But don't worry, I will bring\nValentina here when we get back and\npurify all the souls here. I think\npurification means having Valentina\ndevour all the ghosts here, right? Fongu\nreplied, raising an eyebrow. Upon\nhearing this, Ryan scratched his head,\nturned to look at Alpha beside him, and\nasked, \"Master knows everything.\" Alpha\nshook his head, indicating that he\ndidn't know either. Fongu laughed and\nsaid, \"Hey, Valentina has already told\nme about your evolution methods. Alpha\nevolves by eating meat. You evolve by\nabsorbing life force, and Valentina\nevolves by absorbing soul force.\"\nThinking of this, Fong Yu suddenly\nrealized something, stared wideeyed at\nRyan and Alpha, and exclaimed, \"Damn,\nyou guys really have a complete set of\nprocedures for disposing of a body.\"\nChapter 92. The pigheaded men occupying\nthe ruins of Yorktown. Soon, all 21\ncorpses were resurrected as zombies\nunder the influence of Ryan's eerie\ngreen energy. After all 21 corpses were\nresurrected, Fong Yu smiled as he looked\nat the dense mass of walking corpses\nstanding in front of him. Honestly, the\nsense of oppression Fong Yu felt from\nthese 21 strangely standing zombies was\nmuch greater than that from 21 people.\nAt least living people are afraid of\npain and death. But these 21 are all\nfearless and painless immortal warriors.\nFong Yu asked Ryan and he learned that\nonly by burning all the corpses to ashes\nwould they die completely just like Ryan\nhimself. Although their agility and\ntactics are far inferior to those of a\nliving person, they have an incredible\namount of health. They can withstand\nbeing slashed a dozen or 20 times\nwithout a care. And they are fearless\nand absolutely obedient to orders. This\nis probably the most suitable being in\nthe world to be a warrior. No wonder, Fa\nmurmured. No wonder the villains in\nmovies all want to create those\nbio-engineered soldiers who are fearless\nand painless. These soldiers are the\nmost terrifying beings no matter which\nbattlefield they go to. Ryan seemed to\nhave heard Fong use words and nodded in\nreply. The undead are indeed the most\nsuitable to become warriors, but they\nstill need training. Fongu smiled\nfaintly and asked, \"You can also train\nsoldiers?\" Ryan nodded and said, \"I was\nonce a soldier myself. If you need, I\ncan train an undead army that will be\nabsolutely loyal to you. An immortal\narmy and one that is absolutely loyal to\nus. A glint appeared in Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s\neyes. He stroked his chin and smiled. It\nsounds a bit sinister, but that's\nsomething we can have. Then, led by\nRyan, the group of zombies slowly made\ntheir way towards the mine. As Fong Yu\nwalked at the back of the group, he\nlooked at the rows of zombies moving\nthrough the forest ahead of him and\ncouldn't help but think of the scene in\nzombie movies where Uncle Lynn was\ntransporting corpses. Tsk tsk one is a\nzombie. The other is a walking corpse.\nUncle Lynn's zombie is afraid of\nsunlight, but my walking corpse is not\nafraid of sunlight. Come to think of it,\nit seems that my walking corpse is more\npowerful. The woman's cabin was located\nnot far from the mine. After the group\nreturned to the mine in just a few\nminutes, Ghost Steve immediately came to\ngreet them. Well, Mr. Fongu has the\nthief been caught, Fongu nodded and\nsaid, \"We caught them and we got\neverything back. Phw, that's great.\"\nSteve patted his chest and exclaimed,\n\"Now I can rest assured.\" But then Steve\nsaw the 21 walking corpses densely\npacked behind Fongu and looked\nsurprised. Mr. Fongu, who are these\npeople? Fong Yu then explained to Steve\nthe purpose of bringing these walkers.\nYou want us to command these walkers to\nmine? Steve asked after listening. Funu\nnodded. \"It's not impossible,\" Steve\nsaid, scratching his head. \"However, if\nthey are all beginners, the efficiency\nmight be very low.\" \"That's all right,\"\nFunu said with a smile. \"We&lt;unk&gt;ll dig\nas much as we can, and we&lt;unk&gt;ll teach\nyou slowly if you don't know how.\" In\nthe end, Fong Yu handed the 21 walkers\nover to Steve and then left the mine\nwith Ryan and Alpha. Their next\ndestination was Yorktown, which the\nghosts had always longed for. It's not\neven noon yet, so they have plenty of\ntime to go to Yorktown and see what it\nlooks like now and what the orcs who\noccupy it look like. Before leaving,\nGhost Steve carefully explained the\nlocation of Yorktown to Fong You. After\nleaving the mine and heading north out\nof this forest, you would cross a stone\nbridge and you would see Yorktown. The\ntotal distance was about 3 miles. 3 is\n1.5 km. At Fong Yu's pace, he can get\nthere in 10 minutes if he runs fast. The\nformation along the way is that Alpha\nruns 30 m ahead and Ryan follows 5 m\nbehind Fong Yu. This formation can\nprotect Fong Yu's safety to the greatest\nextent. Soon, Fong Yu and his group\nemerged from the woods and immediately\nsaw a small river about 10 m wide with\nclumps of reads growing along its banks.\nLooking at the gently swaying reads,\nFunu realized that the woman's wooden\nhouse seemed to be not far upstream from\nthis river. I wonder if there's a\nbridge. With this question in mind, Fong\nYu arrived at the riverbank. He looked\nup and down and indeed saw a stone\nbridge about a 100 meters downstream.\nHowever, the middle of the stone bridge\nwas broken, so the only way to cross the\nriver was to swim across. However,\nwhether the river is safe is a question.\nFirst of all, it had just rained and the\nriver was high. Most importantly, he\ndidn't know if there were crocodiles or\npiranas in the river, so it would be too\ndangerous to go down there rashly. In\nresponse, Funu could only ask Ryan to go\ninto the water first since having the\nskill of immortality was truly awesome.\nSoon, Ryan walked into the river in\nfront of him. 2 minutes later, he came\nback up from the opposite bank and waved\nto Fong Yu. It's safe in the water, Ryan\nshouted. With Ryan's reconnaissance,\nFong Yu felt reassured and went down\ninto the river with Alpha, swimming to\nthe other side. After getting ashore,\nFongu wanted to take off his wet wild\nboar armor and the linen shirt\nunderneath to change into some dry\nclothes. But before he could take them\noff, he heard a woman's miserable scream\ncoming from afar. Fongu didn't care\nabout his wet clothes anymore. He\ngrabbed his weapon and ran with Ryan and\nAlpha toward the direction from which\nthe sound came. A short while later,\nFong Yu followed the pitiful howls\nthrough a grove of trees and arrived at\na field. Before Fong Yu could even\nmarvel at the abundant fruits and\nvegetables in the field, he saw several\nplump figures walking along the ridge of\nthe field. Fongu looked closely and\nrealized that those fat figures all had\npig heads on their heads. So, these are\na bunch of pigheaded people. Could they\nbe the orcs that have been entrenched in\nYorktown? At this point, the game\nassistant provided information. These\nare the pigmen, a hybrid of the war\npigmen of the orcs and humans. They are\nhalf orcs and adult pigmen are two to\nthree times stronger than normal adults.\nThey use rudimentary weapons and range\nand height from 1.8 8 to 2.3 m. Although\nthey have limited intelligence, they are\nsocial halfforcs, so it is recommended\nthat players avoid provoking them in the\nearly game. After reading the\ninformation from the game assistant,\nFongu frowned. At this moment, the\npigheaded people on the ridge all\ngathered around a huge bonfire outside\nthe farmland on which a bamboo pole more\nthan 3 m long was placed. On the bamboo\npole, a naked human being was being\nroasted by raging flames with the pole\npassing through his anus and exiting\nthrough his mouth. Beside the campfire,\na pigheaded man was tearing at the\nclothes of a human woman, while another\npigheaded man was sharpening a gleaming\nmachete on a stone, seemingly preparing\nto kill her. Seeing the pigheaded men\nsharpening their knives, Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s\nface darkened. There was no doubt that\npeaceful coexistence with these\npigheaded men was impossible. So the\nonly thing left to do is find a way to\nget rid of these pigheaded people who\nare entrenched in the Yorktown ruins.\nChapter 93 old six in the grass with the\nexplosive hunting bow. When Fong Yu saw\nthe humans strung together on the\ncampfire, he knew that it was impossible\nfor him to coexist peacefully with these\npigheaded people. At the same time, he\nalso noticed a collapsed city wall not\nfar from the farmland through which he\ncould see rows of house ruins behind the\nwall. That should be Yorktown. Every now\nand then, one or two pigheaded men would\nemerge from the ruins of Yorktown and\njoin the bonfire party by the farmland.\nBased on this, it can be concluded that\nthe pigheaded man was one of the orcs\nwho occupied the Yorktown ruins. It is\njust unknown whether there were other\ntypes of orcs. By this time, the woman\nby the campfire had been stripped naked,\nand a fat pigh-headed man grabbed her\nhair and forced her onto a large wooden\nstump. The pigheaded man sharpening his\nknife skillfully walked to the wooden\nstump, shouted something to the\npigheaded men gathered around the\ncampfire, and then all the pigheaded men\nshouted in unison. This time, Fongu\nheard it clearly, \"Thank you for the\ngifts of nature.\" Immediately, the\npigheaded man slashed open the woman's\nneck with a knife, and a large amount of\nblood gushed out like a waterfall, which\nwas caught by a wooden bucket that had\nbeen prepared in advance. Immediately,\nthe dozen or so pigheaded men who were\nsitting around the campfire stood up and\ngathered around the wooden tub filled\nwith blood. One by one, they lined up\nand used the wooden ladles in the tub to\nscoop up the steaming hot blood and\ndrink it. The woman, who wasn't quite\ndead on the wooden stump, had already\nbeen disembowled by the pigheaded man\nwielding a knife, who began to pluck out\nher internal organs. The pigheaded man,\nwho had been pressing down on the woman,\nstarted selecting new bamboo poles,\napparently intending to skewer her and\nroast her over the campfire after her\ninternal organs were removed. Seeing\nthis, Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s killing intent was\nmade up. These pigheaded men who\nslaughtered people like animals had to\ndie. Fongu had already counted the\npigheaded men around the campfire. There\nwere 23 in total about 30 m away from\nhim. The average height of those\npigheaded men was about 2 m. And\nregardless of whether they were male or\nfemale, they were all big and strong. It\nseemed that the chances of winning were\nnot high if he rushed over and fought\nthem handto hand. The distance of 30 m\nis just within the range of my bow and\narrow, and the bow and arrow make no\nsound. So, the best way is to hide in\nthe grass and be the sixth man. He\ndecided to attach explosive charges to\narrows and shoot them into the campfire\nsurrounded by pigheaded men, letting\nthem experience the legendary explosive\nhunting bow. To check his aim, Fongu\nfirst took an empty arrow and shot it at\nthe campfire. He missed, but that didn't\nattract the attention of the pigheaded\nmen scrambling to drink blood from the\nbarrels. So Fong, you shot a second\narrow and this time he missed again. At\nthis point, the game assistant couldn't\nstand it anymore and prompted. Couldn't\nyou just imbue the arrow with your\nmental energy? Like you use a fireball\nspell to guide its direction. Stupid.\nWith the game assistant's reminder,\nFongu suddenly realized, \"That's right.\"\nWho said mental power can only be used\non magic? Fong Yu then imbued the third\narrow with his mental energy. This time,\nguided by his mental energy, the arrow\nsuccessfully shot into the campfire.\nCongratulations on successfully\nmastering the archery skill, divine\narrow. Once your agility reaches eight,\nyou will be eligible to advance to the\narcher class. This is possible. You can\nmaster archery just by shooting an\narrow. Fun was dumbfounded. You call\nthat just randomly shooting an arrow? Do\nyou think everyone can control their\nmental energy so easily? If you hadn't\nbecome a mage first and mastered mental\nenergy control, learning this divine\narrow technique wouldn't have been so\neasy. That's true. However, Fongu didn't\nhave time to think about that now. He\ntook out a simple explosive pack from\nhis backpack, pierced the hemp rope on\nthe explosive pack with an arrow, and\nthen shot it at the campfire in the\ndistance. Whoosh! Guided by Fong use\nmental power, the explosive arrow\nsuccessfully plunged into the campfire.\nHowever, because this arrow was strapped\nwith explosives, it became a much larger\ntarget, spotted by two pigheaded men\ncloser to the fire. They seemed unaware\nof what had landed in the fire and even\napproached it for a closer look. Boom! A\nfierce burst of flames erupted, and the\nentire campfire exploded instantly. The\ntwo pigh-headed men at the forefront\nwere directly blown away by the blast\nwave, and the burning wood was also\ntransformed into huge fire arrows by the\nblast wave, which splashed towards the\nunsuspecting pigheaded men around them.\nIn an instant, the pitiful squeals of\npigs rose and fell. Most of the 20 odd\npigheaded men were injured, and the two\npigheaded men closest to the campfire\nthat were blown away died on the spot.\nBefore the pigheaded men could even\nreact to what was happening and why the\ncampfire had suddenly exploded, Fong\nYu&lt;unk&gt;s second explosive arrow had\nalready been fired into the campfire,\nwhich was still burning. Boom! Another\nviolent explosion rang out, and flames\nengulfed several more pigheaded men. At\nthis moment, all the pigheaded men were\nin complete chaos. Those who were less\nseriously injured were howling and\nrunning towards the city walls, while\nthose who were more seriously injured\nwere lying on the ground struggling and\nhowling. Seeing that the time was ripe,\nFongu waved to Ryan and Alpha superior.\nSo Ryan charged forward with his ax and\nAlfa transformed into his red-haired\nform and followed Ryan. As for Fong Yu\nhimself, in order not to hold Alpha and\nRyan back, he chose to hide in the\nbushes and settle down as the sixth\nbrother. Although Fong Yu did not rush\nforward after mastering the art of\nguiding arrows with mental power, his\narchery skills became incredibly fast,\nalmost hitting the target every time.\nSince his strength was only 7.05, and\nthe damage from an arrow is directly\nrelated to strength, the arrows, after\npassing through the thick skin, fat, and\nmuscles of the pigheaded men were\nunlikely to kill them directly. Fong Yu\nthen aimed his crosshair at the\npigheaded man's eyes, ears, and throat,\npositions where a single shot could be\nfatal. At this moment, Alpha and Ryan\nhad already charged into the panicked\ngroup of pigheaded men. Ryan swung his\nax and sent an ugly pig head flying into\nthe air, spraying a fountain of blood.\nAlfa's tactics were a bit more\nunderhanded, specifically targeting the\npigheaded men's groin area. Since these\npigh-headed men mostly wore only a\nthong-like cloth bag covering their\ngenitals, Alfa's sneak attacks were\nincredibly accurate, and in no time, a\npile of crushed testicles lay on the\nground. Chapter 94. The fat guy who got\nthe right path. Although the pigheaded\nmen were much stronger than ordinary\npeople, they fell one after another into\npools of blood under the attacks of\nRyan's merciless iron axe and Alfa's\nsharp claws. As the master, Fongu was\nnaturally overjoyed. These two\ncompanions were already so strong even\nbefore they had fully recovered their\nstrength. Once they were fully\nrecovered, wouldn't they be able to take\noff? Before Fong Yu could even feel\nhappy, nearly a hundred pigheaded men\nwielding knives, spears, and clubs\nrushed out of the ruins behind the city\nwall, barking and yelling as they\ncharged toward Ryan and Alpha, who were\nfinishing off the enemy by the campfire.\nSeeing this, Ryan and Alfa knew that\nfighting back would only result in\nlosses. So, they immediately fled into\nthe woods in the opposite direction from\nFong Yu. Fong Yu seized the opportunity\nto pull up another explosive arrow and\nshoot it at the campfire that still had\nembers. Just as the dozens of pigheaded\nmen who rushed out of the ruins passed\nby the campfire, the third explosive\narrow landed right in the campfire.\nBoom! The third explosion completely\ndisrupted the rhythm of the pigheaded\nmen's pursuit, and Alpha and Ryan took\nthis opportunity to successfully circle\naround through the woods and return to\nFong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s side. However, just as\nFong Yu was thinking about how to deal\nwith the dozens of newly appeared\npigheaded men, Alpha suddenly turned\naround, bared its fangs behind it, and\ngrowled. Even Ryan took off the ax on\nhis shoulder, and entered battle mode.\nFong Yu immediately sensed something was\nwrong, guessing that there must be\nenemies behind him. So, he immediately\nraised his bow and arrow and looked back\nand saw two pigheaded men walking\ntowards Fong Yu, one in front of the\nother carrying a bamboo pole. Hanging\nfrom the bamboo pole was a fat man, his\nhands and feet bound behind his back,\nhis mouth stuffed with a cotton cloth,\nhis face covered in dirt and grime. At\nthis moment, the two bore men also saw\nFong Yu and Ryan ahead and stopped. In a\ndaz, the fat man hanging on the bamboo\npole also saw Fong Yu and immediately\nbegan to twist excitedly. His mouth,\nstuffed with cotton cloth, began to make\nwoo woo woo noises, seemingly wanting\nFong Yu to save him. Finally, the two\npigh-headed men realized that there were\nactually two humans standing in front of\nthem. So they immediately threw away the\nbamboo poles on their shoulders. And the\nfat man who was tied to the bamboo poles\ntook two stone hammers from their belts\nand roared as they charged at Fong Yu.\nSeeing this, Fong Yu immediately locked\nonto the eye of one of the pigheaded men\nand shot an arrow. With the two sides\nless than 5 m apart, the arrow instantly\npierced the pigheaded man's eye socket,\nspurting out a spray of blood. Just as\nthe boreheaded man clutched his eyes and\nhowled in pain, Ryan had already pounced\non him, raised his iron ax, and chopped\noff the boar man's entire face by\nstriking down from his chin. At the same\ntime, Alpha pounced on another pigheaded\nman, and began to bite and tear at it.\nAlthough each bite and claw could tear\noff a large chunk of flesh from the\npigheaded man, the others flesh was too\nthick to kill easily. Fortunately, Fong\nYusen's arrow had already flown over and\npierced the pigheaded man's throat.\nAlthough the two men and their dog dealt\nwith the two pigheaded men who suddenly\nappeared in front of them as quickly as\npossible, the screams of the pigheaded\nmen when they were injured still\nattracted the attention of the group of\npigheaded men by the campfire. They all\nraised their weapons and charged towards\nFong Yu and his companions while\nhowling. Seeing that their whereabouts\nhad been exposed, Fong Yu decided to\nretreat temporarily after weighing the\npros and cons. After all, if 60 or 70\npigheaded men charged at him at once,\neven Ryan and Alpha would not be able to\nwithstand them with all their firepower.\nFong Yu then put away his bow and arrows\nand said to Alpha and Ryan, \"Retreat.\"\nAfter saying that, he prepared to turn\naround and run away. At that moment, a\nwoof woof woof sound came from the side.\nFong Yu turned his head and then\nremembered that there was a fat man tied\nup by the pigheaded man on the ground.\nWithout saying a word, he said directly\nto Ryan, \"Untie him.\" So, covered in\nblood, Ryan, carrying his still dripping\niron ax came to the man's side and swung\nit down at the fat man. Whoosh! The man\nlet out a piercing scream. \"What are you\nyelling about? I didn't cut you.\" Fu\ncursed irritably. \"If you don't want to\ndie, run.\" Before he could finish\nspeaking, Fongu had already disappeared\ninto the woods with Alpha and Ryan\nfollowing closely behind. The fat man,\nwho had just come to his senses, looked\nat the vines that had been cut across\nhis hands and feet, quickly got up from\nthe ground, ripped the cloth out of his\nmouth, and called out in the direction\nFongu had fled, \"Hey, big brother, wait\nfor me.\" After saying that, the fat man\nrushed into the woods. After traveling\nseveral hundred meters through the\nwoods, the sounds of the pigheaded men\nchasing after Fong Yu gradually faded\naway, seemingly having given up their\npursuit. Fongu stopped to catch his\nbreath. Alfa, who was running ahead, and\nRyan, who was bringing up the rear, also\nstopped. A moment later, the fat man who\nhad been rescued earlier caught up as\nwell. Fongu glanced at the fat man who\nwas panting even louder than him and\nasked helplessly, \"Why are you following\nme?\" Upon hearing this, the fat man\nswallowed hard, moistened his dry\nthroat, and said breathlessly, \"Brother,\nto be fair, given the situation just\nnow, I didn't have any other choice.\"\nFongu then asked, \"How did you get\ncaptured by that pigheaded man?\" \"Uggh,\ndon't even mention it. What a terrible\nday.\" The fat man took out a bucket of\nwater from his backpack, gulped down a\ncouple of mouthfuls, and then sighed in\nrelief. \"There was a river over there,\nwasn't there? I was fetching water\nupstream when I slipped and fell in. I\ncan't swim. But luckily, I was quick and\ngrabbed two pieces of wood from my\nbackpack to use as life buo, otherwise I\nwould have drowned. But as soon as I\nfinally climbed a shore, I saw two\npigheaded men waiting for me on the\nbank, and then I got captured. Fongu was\namused by the fat man's words. This guy\nwas really unlucky. He actually offered\nto deliver food. If he hadn't happened\nto run into Fong Yu, the fat man would\nprobably have ended up like that woman,\nbeing slaughtered and eaten by those\npigheaded men. So Fong Yu nodded and\nreplied, \"All right, now that we're\nsafe, let's go our separate ways.\" He\nwas used to being alone and didn't want\nto have too much contact with other\nplayers. Unexpectedly, the fat man stood\nup and said, \"No way, big brother. It's\ntoo dangerous to go alone. How about we\nteam up?\" Then the fat man looked at\nRyan and said with a shameless grin,\n\"And this big brother, how about the\nthree of us go together? That way we can\nlook out for each other.\" Upon hearing\nthis, Ryan silently shouldered the still\nbloodstained iron axe, turned to look at\nFong Yu, and made a decision based\nsolely on Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s wishes. Fongu\nrolled his eyes, and shook his head,\nsaying, \"Sorry, we don't need your help,\nand we don't have the time to help you.\nBesides, your way back is upstream and\nit's not on our route. After saying\nthat, Fongu prepared to call Ryan and\nAlpha to leave. As the saying goes, one\nshould not have the heart to harm\nothers, but one must have the heart to\nguard against others. Apart from his\nthree partners who consider him their\nmaster, Fongu trusts no one else. Upon\nseeing this, the fat man immediately\nbecame anxious. He quickly waved his\nhand and said, \"Brother, wait. If you\ntwo can escort me back, I will give each\nof you supplies worth 1,000 pieces of\nwood. Fongu stopped in his tracks. At\nthis moment, the fat man seized the\nopportunity and took out 30 iron ore\nfrom his backpack and piled them in\nfront of Fong Yu, saying, \"This is to\nthank you too for your righteous rescue\njust now. I am extremely grateful.\"\nFongu looked at the 30 pieces of iron\nore on the ground, raised his eyebrows\nslightly, and smiled slightly. It seems\nthis fat guy is pretty savvy. Chapter 95\nis at most considered excessive\nself-defense. As long as he escorted the\nfat man home, he could obtain supplies\nworth 2,000 pieces of wood. To be\nhonest, that wasn't a small amount, and\nFongu was somewhat tempted. Moreover,\nthe fat man even took out 20 pieces of\niron or as a token of gratitude for\nsaving his life, which made Fongu think\nmore favorably of him. At least he was a\nguy who knew how to repay kindness. Fong\nYu then waved his hand, collected the 20\niron or stones from the ground, raised\nan eyebrow, and asked, \"Supplies worth\n2,000 wood? Are you that rich?\" To\nunderstand this, 2,000 pieces of timber\nis equivalent to 200 trees. Even if a\nnormal person cuts down 20 trees a day,\nit would still take them 10 days to\naccumulate that amount. The fat man\nimmediately swore an oath. I swear to\nGod, I really have it. As long as you\ncan escort me back, I will definitely\ngive it to you.\" Fonu glanced\nmeaningfully at the backpack on the fat\nman's back and said sarcastically,\n\"Aren't you afraid that the two of us\nwill just kill you and steal your\nsupplies? That would be much simpler for\nus.\" The fat man smiled and said, \"No\nway. You're a good person, brother. I\ntrust you.\" Fongu was immediately amused\nand asked, \"Oh, how do you know I'm a\ngood person? Can you read faces? To\neveryone's surprise, the fat man nodded\nseriously, then shook his head and said,\n\"I don't know how to read faces, but I\njust learned a detection technique\nyesterday that can detect some basic\ninformation about a target. So, you must\nbe the legendary boss, Fong Yu.\" Fong\nYu&lt;unk&gt;s eyes widened. He hadn't\nexpected the other party to see through\nhis identity so quickly. You really have\nthat kind of detection technique? Fong\nYu asked in surprise. The fat man\nchuckled Kung L Y and said, \"That's\nright. I found a silver treasure chest\nthe day before yesterday and got the\nskill from it.\" Upon hearing that the\nskill was obtained from a silver\ntreasure chest, Fongu understood. Now\nthat the fat man had revealed his\nidentity, Fongu was too lazy to scare\nhim anymore and simply said, \"All right,\nthen let's go. You lead the way.\" \"All\nright.\" The fat man smiled, then took\nout a compass and began to determine the\ndirection. Fong Yu was slightly taken\naback when he saw the compass in the fat\nman's hand and asked, \"Where did you get\nthis thing?\" \"Oh, you mean a compass?\"\n\"I found it at the exchange. It cost me\nfive pieces of meat,\" the fat man\nexplained. Upon hearing the fat man's\nwords, Fun Yu immediately raised an\neyebrow. The fact that the fat man was\nwilling to spend 5 yuan to obtain a\ncompass indicated that he was quite\nwealthy, having at least passed the\nstage of having enough to eat and wear,\nand was beginning to seek equipment for\nventuring out to explore. Therefore,\nFongu slightly thought more highly of\nthis fat man. Now that you know my name,\nshouldn't you introduce yourself? Upon\nhearing this, the fat man smiled and\nnodded, saying, \"Hey, my name is Song\nJimming. You should have seen my name\nbefore, brother.\" in the support group.\nUpon hearing that this guy was still in\nhis support group, Fun Yu&lt;unk&gt;s\nexpression finally relaxed and he was no\nlonger so tense. He smiled slightly and\nsaid, \"I do have some impression of him,\nbut I don't usually check the group\nmuch.\" All right, enough of the\nnonsense. Since you're in the support\ngroup, I'll help you out and send you\nback. All right, thanks, big brother.\nDon't be polite with me. The agreed upon\n2,000 supplies cannot be less. Guided by\nthe fat man's compass, the group left\nthe woods and walked upstream along the\nriverbank. After walking for a short\nwhile, Fattyong approached Fong Yu\nagain, grinned sheepishly at him, and\nsaid, \"Brother Fong, I have a question\nfor you. Explain, why are you so\nunwilling to become that lord?\" Sure\nenough, when Fongu learned that the fat\nguy was in the support group, he knew\nthat this guy would be troubled by this\nissue. Fongu even opened the support\ngroup chat to take a look. This guy was\nalready bragging in the group saying\nthat he had met the big shot Fong Yu,\nthat the big shot Fong Yu was awesome\nand so on. However, he also confirmed\nthat the fat man in front of him was\nindeed a member of the fan club. Fongu\nsighed impatiently and replied, \"There\nare many reasons, but the main one is\nthat I have neither the inclination nor\nthe ability to manage the development of\nthe entire region. Besides, there are\nall kinds of birds in a big forest.\nWhether I manage it well or badly,\npeople will criticize me. It's\nincredibly annoying. So, you understand?\nAfter listening, Fatty Song nodded and\nreplied with a smile. I understand. I\nunderstand. But you have to think of it\nthis way. Someone has to be the Lord. If\nyou don't take the position and someone\nelse does, won't you be at the mercy of\nothers? And you'll have to pay taxes and\nstuff. Fongu shrugged and said, \"It's\njust a 5% tax. I don't care about that\nlittle bit of money. I can go out and\nexplore a couple more times and I'll\nhave everything I need. Besides, you\nprobably don't know that after becoming\na lord, you have to participate in a\nlord's championship. I heard the\nmortality rate is very high. Holy crap.\nIs that true? Fatty exclaimed in\nsurprise. Brother, where did you hear\nthat? I didn't know about it. Eh,\nthere's a lot you don't know. Fongu\nnaturally wouldn't tell Fatty Song about\nthe special features of his game\nassistant. Tsk tsk tsk song Jumming\nsmacked his lips and exclaimed no wonder\nno wonder you didn't plan to be that\nlord brother Fong I didn't expect that\nlord would have so many responsibilities\nat this moment remembered something and\nasked by the way last time I said in the\nsupport group that you should choose a\nrepresentative to run for lord did you\nchoose one song jimming shook his head\nand said it's not that easy those people\nonly joined the group because of you. If\nwe're talking about who's truly\nrespected, they'll only respect you. If\nsomeone else were in charge, no one\nwould respect anyone else. Why don't you\nreluctantly agree, Brother Fong? You\nsee, there are still about a thousand\npeople in our support group who support\nyou. Song Jimming tried to persuade him\nagain. To put it another way, if you\ndon't become the lord and the position\nis taken by those with bad intentions,\nthen the whole district will suffer.\nFunu frown. What the fat man said did\nmake some sense. Seeing Fong Yu remained\nsilent, Sanjiing continued to persuade\nhim. I've heard about an organization\ncalled the Dong Seong Society led by a\nbunch of gangsters from Cowoon. They're\nreally eager to become the leader. If\nthose gangsters really become the\nleader, won't our district 6 be thrown\ninto chaos? Upon hearing this, Fong Yu\ncouldn't help but smile and said, \"You\ndon't need to worry about Dong X. They\nwon't be vying for the lord's position\nanymore. Huh? What do you mean? Fattyong\ncraned his neck in confusion. Fong Yu\nsaid calmly because the core members of\nthe Dong Sean Society have already said\ngoodbye to this survival world. Fattyong\nraised an eyebrow in surprise, not quite\nunderstanding at first. After a moment,\nhe suddenly stopped, slapped his\nforehead, and exclaimed, \"Brother Fong,\nyou mean they're all dead?\" Fong nodded.\n\"Holy crap!\" Fatty Song exclaimed in\nshock. I remember their core members\nnumbered 20. Three of them were already\npromoted to warriors and there was one\nhunter. They're&lt;unk&gt; all dead. Fongu\nshrugged. Then how did they die? Did\nthey go to Dragons Nest Mountain in the\ncenter of the region to slay a dragon?\nSong Jimming said incredulously. They\nshouldn't have been that bold, right?\nFong Yu looked at Fatty Song and smiled\nslightly. Remember when I sold a batch\nof cheap equipment at the exchange this\nmorning? I even told you guys in the fan\nclub to go and grab it. Yeah, of course\nI remember. I even managed to snag a set\nof wild boar armor. What a steal. Song\nJimming nodded. Those equipment belong\nto Dong Seongs gang. Song Jimming\ngasped, realizing what was happening.\nSo, Brother Fong, you killed them all.\nFong Yu nodded non-committally and said,\n\"They thought I was easy to bully and\nwanted to surround and kill me. I was\nsimply acting in self-defense.\" Finally,\nFong Yu added, \"At most, it's considered\nexcessive self-defense, not intentional\nhomicide.\" Chapter 96, setting a trap to\nkill the pigheaded man. During the rest\nof the journey, Fatty Song spoke\nsignificantly less, and his gaze towards\nFong Yu held a hint of awe. This was\nexactly the effect Fong Yu wanted. The\nreason he took the initiative to say\nthat he killed Dong&lt;unk&gt;s gang was to\nmake the fat man afraid of him. That\nway, the fat man wouldn't have to say so\nmuch nonsense, and Fong Yu could have\nsome peace and quiet. Moreover, Fongu\ndidn't know much about this fatty song's\nbackground, so he couldn't completely\ntrust him just because he was in the\nsupport group. Telling him that he\nkilled Sidu Haan's gang was actually a\nwarning to him not to try anything\nclever or to make any moves against him.\nA dozen minutes later, led by Fatty\nSong, Fong Yu and his group arrived at\nthe upper reaches of the river. Along\nthe way, they passed the riverbank near\nYorktown again, the spot where Fong Yu\nhad swam across the river. However, they\ndid not encounter the pigheaded men\nagain, presumably because those guys had\ngone back to collect the corpses of\ntheir people. Thinking of those corpses,\nFongu glanced at Ryan and felt it was a\nbit of a waste. So, Fu had an idea and\ncame up with a plan. Hey, Fatty. Fu\ncalled out to the fat man walking ahead.\nWant to pull off something big? Upon\nhearing this, Fattyong immediately\nperked up. To be described as doing\nsomething big by a big shot like Fong Yu\nMin, it must be very profitable. So he\nnodded repeatedly and said, \"Let's think\nabout it. What are we planning to do?\"\nFong Yu pointed in the direction of\nYorktown and said, \"I'm going to\nslaughter all the pigheaded people in\nthat town.\" Fatty Song wiped the cold\nsweat that had suddenly appeared on his\nforehead, gave an awkward laugh, and\nsaid, \"Well, bro, I suddenly remembered\nthat I left a pork hawk stewing in the\npot before I left. If I get back late,\nit might be overcooked. It's very\nprofitable,\" Fongu tempted. Fattyong\nreplied with a mournful face. \"Brother,\neven if there's a profit to be made, we\nstill need to be alive to make it. Those\n2 meter tall pigheaded men, a few dozen\nof them could wipe us all out, and\nyou're still thinking about massacring\nthe village. Hey, what are you saying?\nWho told you we were going to go\nhead-to-head with those pigheaded men? I\nhave a strategy. What tactics? Fatty\nSong asked curiously. Half an hour\nlater, Fatty Song covered his bare chest\nwith both hands. Looked at Fong Yu\nhiding in the bushes with a look of\ngrief and indignation and said with a\nmournful face, \"Brother, is this the\ntactic you were talking about?\" Using me\nas bait, Fong Yu stood in the grass,\nlooking at Fatty Song, who was only\nwearing his underwear, and said\nearnestly, \"There's nothing we can do\namong us. You have the most, whitest,\nand tenderest flesh. Those pigheaded\npeople love to eat human flesh, so your\nwhite flesh is naturally the most\nattractive to them. At this point, Fong\nYu glanced at Fatty Songs underwear,\nraised an eyebrow, and said, \"How old\nare you?\" Still wearing Pikachu cartoon\nunderwear. Upon hearing this, Song\nJimming immediately covered his\nunderwear and said awkwardly, \"Hey,\nPikachu is my childhood idol. Besides,\nwho says only kids can wear cartoon\nunderwear?\" Okay, okay, Fong Yu said\nwith a smile. You're right. All right,\nenough talk. Let's&lt;unk&gt; get started.\nMaybe we should just give up, Sanjimming\nthought, glancing at the pigheaded\npeople sitting around a new bonfire\nunder the distant city wall, eating\nroasted human flesh. He felt a surge of\npanic. He could see it clearly. Those\nbrutal pigheaded people not only ate\nhuman flesh, but also roasted and ate\nthe corpses of their companions over the\ncampfire. What are you afraid of? You're\na grown man. Fongu urged impatiently.\nI've already prepared the explosive\narrows. Just follow my instructions. If\nI tell you to go out, you go out. If I\ntell you to run, you run. After saying\nthat, Fongu didn't wait for Fatty Song\nto say anything more. He picked up a\ntethered explosive arrow and shot it at\nthe newly built bonfire in the group of\npigheaded people. Those pigheaded men\nreally don't learn their lesson. They\nwere just blasted by the campfire less\nthan an hour ago, and now they're\nsitting around a new campfire again.\nIsn't that just giving Fongu another\nadvantage? After an arrow flew into the\ncampfire, the familiar explosion rang\nout again, and the pigheaded people\nsitting around the campfire began to run\naway and panic once more. Before long,\ndozens of pigheaded men ran out from\ninside the city walls. At this moment,\nFong Yu said to Fatty Song, who was not\nfar away, \"Get out.\" Upon hearing this,\nSong Jumming could only grit his teeth,\nrush out of the bushes, and shout at the\ndozens of pigheaded men 30 m away. You\nbastard. Your grandfather is here. With\na loud shout from Fatty Song, the\npigheaded men who were searching for the\nattacker immediately locked onto the\nshirtless fat man and charged at him\nwith their weapons in hand. \"Run!\" Fong\nYu shouted to Song Jimming. Actually, he\ndidn't even need to shout. Fattyong had\nalready turned around and run in the\ndirection Fong Yu had indicated and Fong\nYu followed him out of the bushes on the\nside just over 100 meters ahead. Fong Yu\nhad seen a depression when he was\nescaping. It was probably formed from a\ndried up pond surrounded by towering\nrock walls with only two entrances\nleading down. What Fattyong had to do\nwas lure the pigheaded people into the\ndepression and then lure them down as\nwell. Once that was done, all Fong Yu\nhad to do was block the exits on both\nsides with a lot of rubble and the\npigheaded people would be trapped in the\ndepression. Then Fong Yu would just have\nto throw explosives down there and that\nwould be the end of it. Soon, Fong Yu\nsaw Fatty Song howl and rush into the\nslope leading to the depression. Fong Yu\nalso crouched down to the side, waiting\nfor all the pigheaded men behind him to\nfollow into the depression before taking\nout pebbles from his backpack to block\nthe road. As for the other exit, Ryan\nand Alpha are there to meet up with\nFatty Song and prevent any accidents\nfrom happening to him. Before long, a\nlarge group of pigheaded people rushed\npast Fong Yu. After the last pigheaded\nperson rushed down the slope, Fong Yu\nimmediately rushed out of the bushes,\ntook out 200 pieces of gravel from his\nbackpack, and piled them on the slope in\nfront of him. In the blink of an eye,\ncountless pebbles appeared on the slope.\nA small portion rolled down the slope,\nbut most of them piled up at the\nentrance of the slope, completely\nblocking the road. Meanwhile, Fatty Song\nhad already rushed to the exit slope on\nthe other side of the depression. Fongu\nhad already piled up two large piles of\nrubble on both sides of the slope. The\nmoment Fatty Song rushed up the slope,\nRyan and Alpha pushed over the piles of\nrubble on both sides of the slope.\nInstantly, a massive amount of rubble\nrained down from above, instantly\nkilling the fastest charging pigheaded\nmen. Those slower running pigheaded men\ntried to turn and run away, but more\nthan a dozen were buried by the falling\nrubble. The remaining 60 odd pigheaded\nmen were forced to retreat to the center\nof the depression, where they began to\nhowl angrily. At this moment, Yu, who\nwas standing in the depression, took out\nhis horned bow and an arrow with a\ndynamite attached to it. He smiled\nslightly at the pigheaded people\ngathered in the center of the depression\nand began to draw his bow and knock the\narrow. This time he attached three\nexplosive charges to his arrows. His aim\nwas to kill as many pigheaded men as\npossible in one go because after the\nfirst explosion, the pigheaded men would\nno longer be able to gather together\nlike they were now. So, the amount of\nexplosives used in the first explosion\nhad to be sufficient. After aiming at\nthe group of pigheaded people in the\ndepression, Fong Yu chanted the\nincantation for a fireball spell. Soon,\na small fireball appeared below the\narrow, and under Fong Yu's mental\ncontrol, it ignited the three explosive\ncharges on the arrow. The next second,\nFong Yu shot the arrow loaded with three\nexplosive charges into the group of\npigheaded people. Boom, boom, boom.\nThree explosions rang out in succession,\nand flames and thick smoke enveloped the\npigheaded group in the center of the\ndepression. Soon after, a foul smelling\nrain of blood began to fall from the\nsky, mixed with bits of flesh and bone\nfragments. This time, Fong Yu, who was\nexperienced, hid under a tree in\nadvance, and avoided the bloody rain.\nBut Song Ponzi on the other side of the\ndepression was not so lucky. He was\nstanding there watching the show and was\nsoon stained red by the blood ring.\nAfter the blood and dust settled, Fongu\nreturned to the edge of the depression\nand looked down. The pig-headed men were\nno longer standing at the epicenter. It\nwas a bloody mess. However, a little\nfurther away, more than 20 wounded\npigheaded men lay on the ground,\nclutching their severed limbs or wounds\nand howling. Besides, a dozen or so\npigheaded men tried to climb out of the\nslope blocked by rubble. But what\nawaited them were Fong used deadly\narrows and Ryan's merciless iron axe.\nChapter 97. Counterattack.\nExtermination. After a massacre that\nlasted for more than 10 minutes, the\npigheaded men who had been lured into\nthe depression were finally killed by\nFong Yu and Ryan, who were guarding the\ntwo exit slopes. Ryan even jumped into\nthe depression and used his iron axe to\nfinish off the severely wounded and\ndying pigheaded men one by one. After\nRyan confirmed that all the pigheaded\nmen were dead, Fongu cleared away the\nrubble on the slope and walked into the\ndepression. After Fong Yu arrived at the\ndepression and met up with Ryan, he said\nin a low voice, \"Don't revive those\ncorpses yet. Let's wait until that fat\nguy leaves.\" Ryan nodded. A short while\nlater, Fattyong also stumbled down the\nslope from the other side, gagging as he\nwent. Brother Fong, I'm truly impressed\nby your reasoning, Ugg. Fatty Song said,\nwiping the blood from his face and body\nwith a wet towel. Such a bloody scene.\nDon't you feel uncomfortable at all?\nUgg. Fong Yu put away the horned bow in\nhis hand, shrugged indifferently, and\nsaid, \"Maybe it's because of my\nprofession. I've seen too many bloody\nscenes, so I've gotten used to it.\"\nFattyong thought for a moment and\nreplied. Occupational reasons? What\nprofession allows you to see bloody\nscenes frequently? A hunter, perhaps.\nButcher? There's such a thing as a\nbutcher? The fat man said, looking\ncompletely bewildered. If you hadn't\ntold me, I would have thought you were a\ndemolition expert. You have so many\nexplosives. It's like they're free. By\nthe way, where did you get so many\nexplosives? How about you sell me a\ncouple for self-defense? All right,\nenough talk. Let's clean this up. These\npigheaded men we killed can all be\nbroken down into pieces of meat. So,\nlet's get this over with. Fong reminded\nthem, there are nearly 100 pigheaded men\nhere, and we can get quite a lot of\npieces of meat from them. Can we even\neat the flesh of these pigheaded people?\nThey're half works, aren't they? Aren't\nthey one of our kind? You're the one\nwho's like them. I'm not, Fongu retorted\nirritably. As for whether it's edible or\nnot, why don't you ask the game\nassistant? Oh, right. I almost forgot\nabout that. So, Fong Yu and Song Jimming\nbegan to deal with the corpses on the\nground. In order to save time, Fong Yu\ndid not use his butchering skills, and\nhe also specifically instructed Fatty\nSong not to touch the more than 20\nwellpreserved corpses as he would need\nthem. 10 minutes later, the two had\ncollected a total of 52 mutilated\ncorpses and harvested 195 pieces of\nmeat. Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s idea was to divide\nthem into three portions. One for him\nand Ryan and one for Fatty Song. Fatty\nSong naturally had no objection to this.\nAs for the junk like clubs and sticks\nused by those pigheaded people, Fongu\ndidn't care for them and gave them all\nto Fatty Song. Hey bro, don't be fooled\nby how shabby these weapons look. It's\nbecause you have some good weapons. Most\nplayers don't even have a decent weapon\nyet. These things can still fetch a few\nbucks on the exchange, FattySong\nexplained. Upon hearing this, Fong Yu\nchuckled and said, \"You've got quite the\nclever plan. So, how about it? I told\nyou we were going to pull off something\nbig. This was a worthwhile investment,\nwasn't it? Of course, we won't lose\nmoney. It's a huge profit,\" the fat man\nsaid with a big smile. Putting\neverything else aside, those 63 pieces\nof meat alone are worth more than 800.\nIf you include the weapons and stuff,\nwe'll make 1,000 in profit. The real\nprofits are yet to come. What? Fongu\ntook two buckets of water out of his\nbackpack and placed them in front of the\nfat man, saying, \"Hurry up and wash\nyourself. Then get dressed and come with\nme.\" 5 minutes later, after washing off\nthe blood, Fatty Song put on his clothes\nand headed towards Yorktown with Fong Yu\nand Alfa the dog. Once they were out of\nsight, Ryan approached the 20 odd not\ntoo damaged pigheaded corpses, removed\nthe burlap bandages from their hands,\nand began to revive them. Soon, Fong Yu\nand Song Jiming returned to the bushes\nwhere they had initially ambushed the\npigheaded people. Looking towards the\ncampfire, they saw several wounded\npigheaded people lying on the ground,\ngroaning. Inside the broken city walls,\nseveral SAS and piglets were running\naround, seemingly tending to the wounded\npigheaded people. What do you mean,\nbrother Fong? Are you going to wipe them\nout completely? Fattyong asked.\nOtherwise, what? Fong Yu replied. These\nthings are man-eaters, and they even eat\nthe corpses of their own kind. It's\nimpossible for us to coexist peacefully\nwith these creatures. If we don't\nexterminate them, are we going to raise\na tiger that will become a threat?\nThat's true. So, what do we do now? Are\nwe going to be used as bait again? No\nneed. Fong Yu shook his head and said,\n\"Those SAS and piglets shouldn't leave\nthe town easily. We just need to wait\nhere.\" Huh? Just wait like this. Yes,\njust wait like this. A moment later,\nFong Yu and Song Jimming saw more than\n20 boreheaded men emerge from the woods\nand enter the ruins of Yorktown.\nImmediately, screams of agony echoed\nfrom within the ruins. As an outsider,\nFatty Song was naturally completely\nconfused and didn't know what had\nhappened. He wanted to ask Fong Yu what\nhad happened inside, but Fong Yu\nnaturally wouldn't tell him. After a\nwhile, the screams in the ruins\ngradually subsided, and Ryan came out\nfrom behind the city wall and nodded in\nthe direction of Fong Yu. After seeing\nthe signal Ryan gave him, Fong Yu said\nto Fatty Song, \"Let's go take a look.\"\nHe then took the lead and walked out of\nthe bushes. Huh? It's already done. Song\nJimming followed out, completely\nbewildered. A moment later, he saw Ryan\nstanding under the city wall and was\nstartled. Could it be that this guy\ncovered in rags slaughtered all the\npigheaded people in the town all by\nhimself? Song Jimming gasped. Thinking\nto himself, if that's the case, then\nthis guy is terrifying. Thinking of\nthis, Song Jimming suddenly remembered\nthat his detection skill was off coold\ndown. So after getting close to Ryan, he\ncasually cast detection on him.\nAffiliation: Native of this world. Name:\nOlivia Lane. Race, undead. Skills,\nequipment. Holy crap, this guy isn't a\nplayer. Song Jimming was shocked. What\nsurprised him even more was that the guy\ndressed like a mummy was actually an\nundead. Since entering this survival\ngame, the strangest race song Jimming\nhas ever seen is these pigmen. Now\nanother undead has appeared. Just then,\nRyan seemed to sense Jimming&lt;unk&gt;s\nprobing. Turned to look at Song Jimming,\nwho was following behind Fong Yu. His\nsoul fire in his eyes flashed slightly,\nand he slowly raised the still dripping\niron axe in his hand. Chapter 98. Puppet\nLord. Fong Yu noticed Ryan's unusual\nbehavior immediately. He was slightly\ntaken aback when he saw Ryan walking\ntowards him with an axe. Could it be?\nImpossible. Fong Yu immediately\ndismissed his own guess in his heart.\nThen, as if he had thought of something,\nhe turned to look at Song Jimming, who\nwas pale-faced behind him, as if he had\nrealized something. As Ryan approached\nstep by step, Song Jimming trembled and\nretreated, but perhaps because of fear,\nhis legs were not under his control, and\nhe accidentally fell to the ground.\nFongu raised his hand to stop Ryan, who\nwas walking towards him, and asked,\n\"What's going on?\" Ryan replied in a\nhorse voice. He just investigated me and\nprobably discovered my identity. So\nshould we? As he spoke, Ryan raised the\niron axe in his hand. Fong Yu raised an\neyebrow upon hearing this turned to look\nat Song Jumming who was slumped on the\nground and asked, \"You examined it?\"\nFattyong nodded, his voice trembling.\nFong Yu sighed and said helplessly,\n\"Hey, Fatty, there's a saying that goes,\n\"Curiosity killed the cat. Cats have\nnine lives, so how many do you have?\"\nUpon hearing this, Fattyong immediately\nthought he was about to be silenced. He\npleaded with a sob in his voice,\n\"Brother, I was wrong. I didn't mean\nto.\" Seeing that, Fattyong was so scared\nhe was about to wet his pants. Fong Yu\nsmiled slightly, squatted down, patted\nFatty Songs shoulder, and said, \"All\nright, I'm not teasing you anymore. I\nwouldn't kill you over something like\nthis. Get up and talk.\" As he spoke,\nFong Yu pulled the fat man up from the\nground. Then Fong Yu pointed to Ryan and\nexplained to the fat man, \"The reason I\ndidn't tell you its identity is because\nI thought you would be scared. Don't\neven mention you. I was terrified when I\nfirst met it, too. But don't worry, Ryan\nis a very nice person. very kind and\nhelpful, right? Ryan. Upon hearing this,\nRyan quickly cooperated with his master\nby hiding the iron axe behind his back\nand obediently nodded. Song Jimming\nglanced at the still dripping iron axe\nbehind Ryan and then recalled the scene\nof this guy slaughtering those pigheaded\nmen in the depression and couldn't help\nbut twitch the corner of his mouth. You\nactually say this terrifying humanoid\nkilling machine has a kind heart and is\neven helpful. I think they're happy to\nhelp others be reincarnated. But what\ncould he do? Might makes right. So Song\nJimming could only nod me and agree with\nFong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s statement. However,\nthere's something I want to remind you\nof, Fong Yu said, looking at Song\nJimming meaningfully. I expect you to\nkeep all information about me\nconfidential. Is that all right? No\nproblem. Absolutely no problem. Fatty\nSong quickly replied. I'd rather die\nthan tell. I'll keep it to myself.\nHearing Song Pongs statement, Fong Yu\nsmiled with satisfaction and said,\n\"You're sensible. All right, let's go. I\npromise to escort you back, so let's not\nwaste any more time.\" Led by Song\nJimming, the three walked upstream along\nthe river for 10 minutes. They didn't\nencounter any more pigheaded men along\nthe way, but they did run into a giant\nbrown bear that came to the river to\ndrink water. The bear looked like a\nsmall car and weighed more than a ton.\nThe brown bear originally intended to\nattack Fong Yu and his group. But when\nit saw Ryan raise his battle axe and\nsummon a green lion shadow in front of\nhis chest, it tucked its tail between\nits legs and ran away. This scene left\nSong Jimming completely stunned. Wow,\nthis actually works. Fatty Song\nexclaimed in surprise. Is this magic?\nRyan shook his head and said, \"No, this\nis the battle aura used by warriors.\nOnce you reach the swordsman level, you\ncan release your battle aura outwards\nlike I did just now. Sword masters hiss.\nSong Jimn gasped. Although he didn't\nchange jobs, he still understood the\nlevels of each profession. The warrior\nsystem ranks from lowest to highest as\nfollows: apprentice warrior, low-level\nwarrior, intermediate warrior, highle\nwarrior, swordsman, great swordsman, and\nsword saint. Although many players have\nnow obtained the opportunity to change\njobs, they are mostly at the apprentice\nlevel, and low-level ones are extremely\nrare. But now, this strange person\nwrapped in bandages actually claims to\nbe a swordsman. No wonder when I used\nthe detection skill on it before, the\nfeedback was almost entirely question\nmarks. The level difference is too big.\nMore importantly, the mummy calls Fong\nYu master, which means that Fong Yu has\ntaken in a swordsman level servant. How\ndid he manage to do that? Song Jimming\ntook a deep breath. He thought he had\nthought highly of Fong Yu. But in the\nend, he realized that he had\nunderestimated him. Even his servants\nare sword masters. So what level is Fong\nYu? A master swordsman? A sword saint?\nNo way. This survival game has only been\ngoing on for a few days. It can't get\nmuch lower. It seems that Fong Yu is\nholding back when dealing with those\npigheaded men. His true strength must be\nextremely formidable. With that in mind,\nSong Jimming decided that he absolutely\nhad to cling to Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s powerful\nbacker no matter what. Seeing the brown\nbear escape, Fong Yu breathed a sigh of\nrelief. At the same time, he realized\nthat the dangers in the wild were much\nhigher than he had expected. Neither the\npig-headed man nor the brown bear from\nbefore were things that novice players\ncould handle. It seems that this\nsurvival game is quite difficult and the\ndifficulty is directly related to the\nplayer's mortality rate. At this moment,\nSong Jimming pointed to the other side\nof the river and said, \"That's it. My\nhouse is over there.\" Fong Yu looked in\nthe direction Song Jimming pointed but\ndid not see any wooden sheds or houses,\nonly a large expanse of reads. \"Are you\nsure?\" Fong Yu raised an eyebrow and\nasked, \"Didn't we go to the wrong\nplace?\" No way. Fattyong laughed. My\nwooden house is hidden in that reed bed.\nHidden in the reeds. Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s eyes\nlit up. That's a great idea. If you look\nclosely, you can indeed vaguely see the\nroof of a wooden house in the reeds. At\nthis moment, Sanjuming had already taken\na small wooden boat out of his backpack\nand placed it on the river. He turned to\nFong Yu and said, \"Boss, want to come\nalong?\" Fong Yu glanced at the small\nwooden boat, then at Sun Jimming&lt;unk&gt;s\nstout body and shook his head, saying,\n\"Forget it. You can take the boat back\nyourself. I should go, too.\" \"All\nright.\" \"All right. Here's the escort\nfee you promised.\" With that, Sanjuming\ntook a pile of wood out of his backpack\nand placed it on the ground for Fong Yu\nto pick up. Although 2,000 pieces of\nwood were nothing to Fong Yu now, he\nstill smiled. \"At least the fat man kept\nhis promise and didn't try anything\nfunny. Though of course, he wouldn't\ndare. Fatty, I'm a little curious. So\nmuch wood is a considerable fortune for\nordinary players. Is it your family's\nwealth? Fong Yu asked tentatively. Upon\nhearing this, Sanjing was slightly taken\naback and hesitated whether to tell\nFongu the truth. After all, he wasn't\nstupid. He understood the principle of\nnot flaunting wealth. Moreover, this was\na survival world without legal\nconstraints. So Song Jimming chuckled\nand said, \"He he, I won't hide it from\nyou, boss. This 2,000 wood is indeed my\nsavings. I've been working hard to save\nit up since I first entered the game.\"\n\"Oh, I see.\" Fongu raised an eyebrow\nslightly and said, \"In that case, I'll\ntake 1,000 pieces of wood from you\nfirst.\" \"Really?\" Seeming&lt;unk&gt;s face lit\nup with joy. \"Okay.\" Fong Yu nodded and\nsaid, \"You can pay the remaining 1,000\nin installments.\" Seeming couldn't help\nbut roll his eyes and replied, \"Boss,\nyou know about installment payments.\"\nHowever, at that moment, Ryan suddenly\nwalked up to Fong Yu and said, \"Master,\nthere's a fire over there.\" Upon hearing\nthis, Fong Yu looked in the direction\nOlivia pointed and found that it was\nindeed the Reed marsh that Song Jimming\nhad mentioned. At that moment, thick\nblack smoke was rising from the reeds.\nSong Jimming noticed the situation in\nthe reed marshes and screamed in alarm,\n\"Holy crap, my home.\" He then jumped\nonto the small wooden boat, picked up\nthe paddle board, and rode towards the\nreed marshes. Seeing the fat man's\ndesperate effort in swinging the paddle\nboard, Fong Yu couldn't help but\nchuckle. \"Master, should we go help?\"\nRyan said. \"There are still five people\nthere. They're the ones who set the\nfire.\" Upon hearing this, Fun Yu\nimmediately frowned. Someone actually\nset fire to the house. They're\ndefinitely not good people. They're\nprobably a gang of robbers. If Fatty\nSong goes back like this, wouldn't it be\nlike handing his head over to someone?\nSigh. This fat guy is really unlucky.\nOne bad thing after another keeps\nhappening to him. Oh, right. Fongu\nsuddenly remembered something and turned\nto Ryan, asking, \"How can you detect the\nenemy's presence from this distance?\"\nRyan nodded and said, \"With my current\nstrength, I can detect the presence of\nenemies within 50 m, but if the other\nparty is a stealthy infiltrator or\nsomeone of a higher level than me, then\nI will not be able to detect them.\" \"I\nsee.\" Funu smiled. He hadn't expected\nRyan to have such a detection skill.\n\"Wasn't this like having a humanoid\nradar that could detect within a 50 m\nrange? It seems that my safety has been\nimproved without me even realizing it.\"\nAt this point, Ryan asked again, \"So,\nshould we go straight back or go help\nhim?\" Funu sighed softly upon hearing\nthis and said, \"We agreed to escort him\nhome, and we've already taken the money.\nWe can't let him die on his doorstep.\nLet's go.\" After saying that, Fongu\nlooked at Ryan. Ryan understood, put his\narm around Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s waist, and with\na powerful push of his legs, he carried\nFong Yu across the river to alert the\nenemy. Ryan did not fly directly into\nthe reeds with Fong Yu. Instead, they\nlanded on the riverbank outside the\nreeds. Fong Yu then took out his horn\nbow and followed Ryan as they quietly\ncrept into the reeds. Fongu had only\ntaken a few steps when he heard a shout\nwhich sounded like Fatty song. H, I'll\nfight you to the death. As soon as he\nfinished speaking, the sound of weapons\nclashing rang out again. However, a few\nseconds later, Fong, you heard Fatty\nSong scream and the laughter of several\nstrange men. Haha, you fatso. You think\nyou can ambush your grandpa? You should\ntake a piss and look at yourself in the\nmirror. Haha, I can't believe this guy\nactually dares to come back. He's asking\nfor it. Hawkmarked guy, search his bag\nand see if there's anything good left.\nOkay, donkeys, hurry up, too. Don't\nleave any of those jerky pieces on the\nshelf. Fong Yu pursed his lips slightly,\ndrew an arrow, and knocked it on the\nbowring. He had now gotten very close,\nseparated from the group of men, only by\na clump of reads. At this moment, he\ncould see clearly that the group seemed\nto be burning the reads around the house\nwith torches. Hidden in those reads were\nmany frames made of branches with many\npieces of meat that looked black. That\nseems to be a suggested meat drying rack\nused to dry fresh meat and make it into\njerky so that the meat pieces are not\neasily spoiled. It turns out the black\nsmoke wasn't from burning houses, but\nfrom burning the surrounding reeds.\nThese guys were looking for the meat\ndrying racks hidden in the reeds. He It\nseems this fatty song has a lot of good\nstuff hidden away. Just then, someone\ninside suddenly shouted, \"Brother Chong,\nwe've struck it rich this time. I didn't\nexpect this fat guy to have so many\nsupplies. Not only is the room full of\ngood stuff, but his bag also has so many\ngood things. There are hundreds of\npieces of meat alone. Yeah, this guy is\nprobably the richest player in our\nregion, right? Are you stupid? The\nrichest one is definitely our boss.\nWe've robbed dozens of players these\npast few days, and all the loot is with\nthe boss. It must be worth almost 50,000\nworth of supplies, right? How could the\nboss not be the richest? Fong Yu raised\nan eyebrow slightly upon hearing this.\nHaha. 50,000 is the richest. You're not\ntaking me, Fong Yu, seriously. At this\nmoment, a middle-aged man with a deep\nvoice said, \"All right, Xiaoo, stop with\nthe nonsense. I know you've been\nthinking about distributing the\nsupplies. No rush. I've stored up\neverything we've looted these past few\ndays. Once we've ransacked this fat\nguy's house, we'll go back and\ndistribute the supplies.\" He, brother\nChong, that's not what I meant. All\nright, enough talk. Let's get to work.\nBy the way, Brother Chong, what should\nwe do with this fat guy? Should we kill\nhim? Upon hearing this, Fong Yu drew his\nbow and arrow while Ryan beside him\nraised his iron ax, and the two were\nready to fire. But to Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s\nsurprise, that Chongu actually cursed.\nYou don't believe me when I say you're\nstupid. Xiau, bewildered by the insult,\nasked, \"Brother Chong, why are you\nscolding me? How am I stupid?\" Chong\nreplied, \"This fat guy has so many good\nthings in his room, and he has hundreds\nof pieces of meat in his backpack.\nAren't you curious about how he got so\nmany supplies?\" \"H little Tiger slapped\nhis thigh and said, \"That's right. This\nguy must have discovered some way to\nobtain resources. So boss, what you mean\nis take him back and interrogate him\nthoroughly to see if we can get any\ninformation out of him. Okay. Upon\nhearing this, Fongu slowly released the\nbow string and signaled Ryan to step\nback. Since the fat man was not in\nimmediate danger, he decided to hold off\non making a move. Why? Because he\nplanned to follow these guys to their\nhideout and wipe them out in one fell\nswoop. As little Kurami just mentioned,\nthe boss has stockpiled tens of\nthousands of dollars worth of stolen\ngoods. So Fu has to do his duty to\navenge those players who were robbed and\nkilled. 5 minutes later, the group had\nlooted the meat drying racks around Song\nJimming supplies and the supplies inside\nthem. They then tied Song Jimming to a\nbamboo pole and carried him out of the\nreeds. Yes, it's the same position as\nwhen I was tied up by the pigheaded man.\nHaha, Fatty, it seems you have a real\naffinity for bondage. So Fong Yu and\nRyan followed far behind the group. With\nRyan sent tracking them, they weren't\nworried about losing them, especially\nsince the group was carrying a fat man\nand couldn't walk fast. Half an hour\nlater, Ryan reminded him, \"Master,\nthey've stopped.\" Upon hearing this,\nFong Yu reached forward a short distance\nand indeed saw a wooden house not far\naway with seven wooden sheds scattered\naround it. Judging from the number of\nhouses and wooden sheds, this is still a\nsettlement and there should be three\nmore people there. Are there any\npowerful people among them? Fongu asked\nRyan beside him. After carefully\nobserving the settlement, Ryan nodded\nand said, \"There is only one low-level\nwarrior and hunter, and the rest are\nordinary people. I can handle it all by\nmyself.\" Hearing this, Fongu relaxed.\nThere was nothing to be afraid of then\nas these people were not as strong as\nthe Dong Sean gang he had encountered\nbefore. He is as steady as a rock and\nnever fights a battle he is not sure of\nwinning unless he is ambushed. So even\nthough it was a crushing victory, Fong\nYu didn't play recklessly. Instead, he\nobserved for a while longer and saw Song\nJumming who was tied to a bamboo pole\nbeing casually thrown beside the wooden\nhouse and tied to a tree trunk with a\nrope. Then the five people went into the\nwooden house. And a little while later,\nthree more people from the surrounding\nwooden sheds went into the wooden house.\nJudging from the situation, those people\nseemed to be planning to hold a meeting\nin the cabin, they are very likely\ndiscussing how to divide the looted\nsupplies. Just then, while they were\ndividing the spoils, and no one was out\nkeeping watch, Fong Yu and Ryan quietly\nsneaked into the settlement. Along the\nway, Fong Yu discovered many animal\ntraps hidden in the grass and even a\ndeep pit covered with turf with wooden\nspikes placed inside. These silent traps\nwould be difficult for even Ryan to\nspot. Thankfully, they sneaked in\ncautiously. If they had rushed in with\ngreat fanfare, they probably would have\nfallen into these traps. Ryan is all\nright since he's immortal. But Fong Yu,\nwhether he gets caught in a bear trap or\nfalls into a pit of splinters, will be\nin serious trouble. Soon, Fong Yu and\nRyan reached the tree trunk where Song\nJimming was tied up. Upon closer\ninspection, they saw that the fat Songs\nbare upper body was covered in bruises\nand there were dark circles under his\neyes. It seemed that he had been beaten\nup quite badly. Song Jamming had already\nwoken up, but because he was tied up\nvery tightly, he couldn't even struggle,\nso he could only sit by the tree trunk\nand groan. Suddenly, a hand covered\nSunjming&lt;unk&gt;s mouth, startling him so\nmuch that his eyes widened. Shu, Fong Yu\nslowly moved from the side to in front\nof Song Jimming and said, \"It's me.\"\nWhen Seong Jimming recognized Fong Yu,\nhis eyes lit up with surprise and\ndelight. I'll untie you now, but don't\nrun around. There are traps all around.\nJust wait here for me. Understand? Song\nJimming nodded repeatedly upon hearing\nthis. Fong Yu then gave Ryan a look and\nRyan lightly swung his iron ax, cutting\nthe hemp rope on the tree trunk. At this\nmoment, Fong Yu also released his hand\nfrom Song Jimming&lt;unk&gt;s mouth. \"Boss,\nthank you so much. You saved me again.\"\nSong Jimming said gratefully. \"Stop\ntalking nonsense and stay put.\" After\nsaying that, Fongu took out a simple\nexplosive pack, hung it on the arrow,\nand turned to aim at the wooden house.\nPerhaps those guys were taking advantage\nof their numbers, so they didn't close\nthe door of the cabin, which gave Fongu\nthe opportunity. A bursting arrow for my\nbuddy. With a hiss, a small flame\nignited the fuse of the explosive\ncharge. Fong Yu quickly drew back the\nbow string and aimed at the wooden house\ndoor a dozen meters away. Whoosh! The\narrow pierced the air and guided by Fong\nYu's mental energy accurately struck the\nwooden door. 3 2 1. As Fongu finished\nhis countdown, a flame lit up inside the\nwooden house. Boom! The windows of the\nwooden house were blown open and half of\nthe door was blown away. Orange flames\nmixed with thick smoke billowed from the\ngaps around the wooden house. Fongu\ndidn't go forward to check directly.\nInstead, he opened the game system\ninterface and checked his honor points,\nfinding that they had increased by 17\npoints. It seems the bombing raid\nsuccessfully killed several people, but\nhe couldn't be sure exactly how many.\nThe safest approach is to immediately\nfire another explosive arrow. So, he\ntook out a second explosive arrow and\naimed it at the cabin. This scene\ncompletely stunned Song Jumming, who was\nstanding to the side. How many bombs do\nyou have, boss? Are you a demolition\nexpert or something? Can you stop with\nall that nonsense? Fongu frowned. Okay.\nOkay, I'll shut up. The next instant,\nFong Yu flicked his fingertips to ignite\nthe explosive arrow on the bow string\nand shot it again into the wooden house.\nThis time, aiming at the window. The\nexplosive arrow shot into the window of\nthe wooden house without any hindrance.\nBut before it could explode, Fong Yu saw\ntwo figures rush out of the door of the\nwooden house. Sure enough, the first\narrow didn't kill all those guys. At the\nsame time, the explosive charge on the\nsecond arrow inside the cabin finally\ndetonated. The powerful blast wave sent\nthe two men dressed in black flying at\nthe doorway, who then landed on the\nground not far from Fong Yu. Fongu\nglanced at the raging flames inside the\nwooden house, estimating that there were\nprobably no survivors inside, and then\ngestured to Ryan to check if the two\nguys who had escaped were still alive.\nWithout wasting words, Ryan picked up\nhis ax, walked over to one of the men,\nand smashed the man's head in one blow.\nFongu fell silent while Song Jiming was\ncompletely stunned. \"No, brother. I\nasked you to check if they're dead or\nnot, not to send them to their deaths.\"\nAt the same time, Ryan suddenly raised\nhis right leg to dodge the dagger swung\nby another person on the ground and then\nstomped hard on the man's shoulder blade\nwith his raised right leg. With a crisp\ncrack, sound of bones breaking, the guy\non the ground let out a terrible scream.\nHuh? Funu chuckled coldly upon seeing\nthis scene. He had guessed that these\ntwo guys might be figning death to find\nan opportunity to counterattack. And he\nwas right. If someone with little\nexperience went up to check them\ndirectly, they might actually be killed\nin return. But as a novelist, he had\nseen and written about this kind of\ncounterattack scenario far too many\ntimes. So naturally, he wouldn't fall\nfor it. Fortunately, there was Ryan, a\nswordsman level warrior who was also\nimmortal, making him the perfect person\nto help with the lightning strike. After\nkilling the two men, Ryan, without Fong\nYu&lt;unk&gt;s orders, picked up his ax and\nwent into the still burning wooden\nhouse. A moment later, he came out again\nand shook his head at Fong Yu. The\nimplication was that there were no\nsurvivors inside. Since that's the case,\nlet's put out the fire and salvage the\nsupplies quickly. All the supplies here\nnow belong to Fong Yu. Although Fong Yu\nwas only a low-level mage, under\nValentina's guidance, he managed to\nlearn all the low-level magic of each\nelement, including the low-level water\nmagic, water gun. Although the water gun\ntechnique has limited attack power and\nis unlikely to kill enemies, it is very\neffective at extinguishing fires. In\nless than 3 minutes, the fire in the\nwooden house was completely extinguished\nby Fong Yu using the water gun\ntechnique. Fong Yu then shouted, \"Fatty,\nget to work.\" Okay. Having already\ncooperated with Fong Yu once, Song\nJimming naturally understood Fong\nYu&lt;unk&gt;s meaning. He grabbed his\nbackpack, tidied it up, and then went\ninto the wooden house to start\nscavenging for supplies. Fong Yu found a\nwooden shed, sat inside, and began\nmeditating to restore his magic power.\nAn hour later, Song Jimming neatly\nstacked 15 backpacks of different sizes\nin front of the wooden shed where Fongu\nwas resting. Then he cautiously said to\nRyan, who was standing guard beside him,\n\"Brave man, please tell Boss Fongu that\nI have packed all the supplies.\" Ryan\nnodded and went into the wooden shed. A\nmoment later, Fongu came out of the\nshed. He glanced at the backpack on the\nground and was also a little surprised.\nSo much song Jimming wiped the sweat\nfrom his forehead and replied, \"We could\nhave had more, but four backpacks were\nburned in the fire.\" The rot tan, flax,\nwood, and other materials inside fell\nout and burned. Fongu nodded and said,\n\"Okay, I understand. Thank you for your\nhard work.\" He nodded all. I should\nthank you for saving my life once again,\nsir. Fu glanced at the fat man song and\nnoticed that he wasn't carrying a\nbackpack. He then looked at Ryan who\nshook his head indicating that Song\nJimming hadn't secretly hidden anything.\nThis was somewhat unexpected for Fong\nYu. He raised an eyebrow and asked Song\nJimming, \"Fatty, where are your own\nbackpack and supplies?\" Song Jimming\npointed to three of the 15 backpacks on\nthe ground and said, \"All my supplies\nare here.\" \"What do you mean by that?\"\nFunu asked curiously. Hey, we should\nrepay kindness. Song Jiming chuckled and\nscratched his head. He he saved me twice\ntoday. I'm really grateful. So, I want\nto give you all my supplies as a way of\nthanking you for saving my life. After a\nmoment of silence, Fongu smiled faintly\nand asked, \"Fatty, you gave me all the\nsupplies and your house burned down. How\nare you going to survive now?\" To\neveryone's surprise, Song Jimming\nlaughed and said, \"Haha, to be honest,\nBrother Fong, I plan to follow you from\nnow on, but I don't know if you'd be\nwilling to take me under your wing.\"\nFong Yu is the kind of person who is\neasily swayed by kindness, but doesn't\nknow how to fight back. If someone tries\nto be tough on him, he will fight back\nwithout hesitation. However, if someone\nsincerely asks him for a favor, he finds\nit difficult to refuse. However, he\ndidn't really want to bring this fat man\nback to live with him. It felt a bit\nawkward, so he was in a dilemma. But\nsoon, he came up with an idea and smiled\nslightly at Song Jimming, saying, \"Are\nyou really planning to follow me from\nnow on?\" \"Absolutely sincere. I swear.\"\nSong Jimming said confidently. \"That's\ncertainly possible,\" Fong nodded. \"I\nhappen to have a good plan, but I'm\nmissing an assistant.\" \"Plan? What\nplan?\" Song Jimming asked curiously.\nFong Yu said, \"Remember that ruin that\nwas taken over by the pigheaded men? It\nused to be a town. Although it's\nabandoned, I believe that with enough\ntime and resources, we should be able to\nrebuild it on the site.\" Haven't you\nguys in the support group been clamoring\nto find a place to establish a\nsettlement? What do you think of this\nplace? Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s words immediately\ngave Fatty Song the feeling of seeing\nthe light after the clouds had parted.\nYes, although the ruins of this town are\nin ruins, the foundation is still there.\nWith enough manpower and the help of the\ngame's manufacturing and construction\nsystem, it is quite feasible to rebuild\na town. It's much more convenient than\nbuilding a town on flat ground. Thinking\nabout this, Fattyong couldn't help but\nexclaim, \"Holy crap, Brother Fong, I\nfinally understand. So, the reason you\nwanted to kill all the pigmen here was\nto seize this town ruin and make it our\nsettlement. You're really brilliant. He\nkeep a low profile. Funu smiled calmly.\nHe had indeed made the decision on a\nwhim, thinking that the place was\nsuitable for a settlement. Because he\nwas thinking long-term, he knew that\nonce the districts were merged,\nconflicts or even wars might break out\nbetween them. A settlement built on the\nfoundation of such a town ruin would\nnaturally be much safer than one built\non a plane or in a forest. If it's a\nplane, it will be very difficult to\ndefend. If it's a forest, a single fire\ncan wipe out the entire settlement.\nTherefore, this is undoubtedly the best\nsettlement location that Fongu can find\nat present. I have another idea. Would\nyou like to hear it? Fongu said again.\nLook at what you're saying. How could I\ndare disobey? Later, you can tell\neveryone in the fan club that you\ndiscovered the ruins of this town and\nthen mobilize everyone to come and build\na settlement. Why is that? Song Jimming\nasked puzzled. Fong Yu then explained,\n\"I want you to be the lord of district\n6. Make me a lord.\" Song Jimming was\nstunned on the spot. After a long pause,\nhe shook his head repeatedly and\nreplied, \"No, no, I'm just a bystander\nat best. I'll be content to follow\nbehind you and have a taste of the soup.\nSong Jimming thought Fong Yu was testing\nhis thoughts, so he immediately\nexpressed his attitude. Don't be\nnervous. Fong Yu patted Fatty Song on\nthe shoulder to comfort him. I'm\nserious. You should know that I'm a\nrather lazy person, someone who's used\nto being free and easy, but being a lord\ninvolves a lot of trouble, and I don't\nwant to bother with that. However, I'm\nnot comfortable letting someone I don't\nknow become the Lord. So, you know what\nI mean, right? After listening to Fong\nYu&lt;unk&gt;s explanation, Sanjimming\nrealized that Fong Yu really intended\nfor him to be the lord, or more\naccurately, a puppet lord. Even a puppet\nlord is still a position second only to\nthe emperor. But brother Fong, why did\nyou choose me to be the lord? We've only\nknown each other for less than 2 hours.\nFongu glanced at the fat man and smiled.\nAlthough we haven't known each other for\nlong, I find you quite pleasing to the\neye. You are grateful and sensible, and\nthat's enough. Fong, you didn't mention\nthe other reasons, such as that the fat\nman was very timid and would immediately\nback down if scared at the slightest\nprovocation, making him easier to\ncontrol as a lord. Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s current\nthinking is similar to Chow Chows idea\nof holding the emperor hostage to\ncommand the feudal lords. As long as he\ncan put this fat man in the position of\nlord, he can become the mastermind\nbehind the scenes. Moreover, Fong\nYu&lt;unk&gt;s situation is different from\nChow Chows. Chowo Chow user the power of\nthe Han Emperor, so his actions were\nillegitimate. However, Fong Yu had\nvoluntarily given the Lord's power to\nFatty Song, and all he wanted was to be\nexempted from his own 5% taxation. He\nwouldn't interfere too much in the\nLord's management affairs, so FattySong\ncould only be grateful. Unless one thing\nis certain that after becoming the lord,\nFattyong might want to find an\nopportunity to eliminate Fong Yu, the\nreal boss hiding behind him. But at\npresent, such a possibility is unlikely.\nFirst, after half a day of contact and\nprobing, this fatty song didn't seem\nlike the kind of ingrate who would turn\nhis back on you. Besides, a man wearing\nPikachu shorts couldn't be all that bad,\ncould he? Secondly, given Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s\ncurrent strength and influence, it's\nvirtually impossible for Fatty Song to\nthreaten him. Moreover, from a certain\nperspective, Fong Yu is San Jiming&lt;unk&gt;s\nbiggest backer. Of course, you can know\na person's face, but not their heart.\nFong Yu couldn't completely trust this\nguy. He was just temporarily using him\nas a scapegoat. If he felt good about\nhim, he would let him continue to do it.\nIf he felt it wasn't good, Fong Yu only\nneeded to maintain his superior strength\nand have the ability to replace him at\nany time. So why not let this fatty give\nit a try first? Chapter 99. The fright\nat dinner. Sanjiing was naturally more\nthan willing to accept Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s\nproposal. After all, people like Fong Yu\nwho were not interested in power and\nstatus were a minority. Not to mention\nthat he could collect 5% of the\ndistrict's taxes. So Song Jimming\nreadily agreed. Brother Fong, from now\non, you're my big brother. Song Jimming\nsaid with a fawning smile. If there's\nanything I can do for you in the future,\njust let me know. Song Jimming was\nindeed a sensible person. Although he\nknew that he had only just begun to get\ncloser to the Lord, he still made sure\nto adjust his attitude in advance and\nwas willing to follow Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s\nlead. After all, whether he could become\nthe Lord depended entirely on the Lord\nin front of him. Moreover, Fong\nYun&lt;unk&gt;s ability to wipe out a group of\nover 200 pigheaded men in just over an\nhour and to easily destroy an eightp\nperson squad demonstrates his terrifying\nstrength. Not to mention that he had\npreviously wiped out the 20 main members\nof the Dong Sean gang. Putting aside the\nsoft power of strategies, the dozens of\nexplosive packs that Fong Yu took out\nwere enough to leave Song Jimming\nspeechless. Other players were using\nweapons like wooden sticks and machetes.\nAnd the slightly more skilled ones were\nonly using iron swords, spears, or bows\nand arrows. But Fongu had already\nstarted using explosive charges, and he\nwas taking out dozens at a time. This is\na complete dimensional reduction attack.\nWhat's more, he also has a fierce dog\nand an undead follower with explosive\ncombat power at the swordsman level.\nMoreover, Song Jimming always felt that\nFong Yu's true strength might be far\nmore than what he appeared to be and\nthat he probably had other Trump cards\nthat he was unaware of. So, with such a\nthick and long leg, only a fool wouldn't\nhug it. According to the kill report,\nthe group of people killed by Fong Yu\ncontributed a total of 45 honor points\nto Fong Yu. Ignoring the one honor point\neach of the eight people themselves had,\nthat means these eight people killed 37\nplayers. When Fong Yu told Song Jimming\nabout the situation, Song Jimming shrank\nback in fear. Holy crap, they killed 37\nplayers. That's insane. Song Jimming\nexclaimed. No wonder. I was wondering\nwhy there were fewer and fewer players\naround here. They've killed them all.\nSigh. Luckily, I met you, brother Fong\ntoday. Otherwise, I probably would have\nbeen killed by them. Song Jimming&lt;unk&gt;s\nseemingly irrelevant flattery still\npleased Fong Yu somewhat. He smiled\nslightly and said, \"All right, enough\nnonsense. Let's take stock of the\nsupplies and get ready to leave.\" \"All\nright.\" Funu then roughly inspected the\n15 backpacks. They were mostly filled\nwith low-level materials such as wood,\ngravel, and iron ore. Although there\nwere quite a few of them, they didn't\ncatch Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s eye. \"By the way,\nFatty, what's in here? Your supplies?\"\nFong Yu asked. Upon hearing this,\nSanjming hesitated for a moment before\npointing to two of the backpacks and\nsaying, \"My supplies are all in here.\"\nFonu glanced at the two backpacks.\nJimming was pointing to and raised an\neyebrow slightly. He had examined the\nsupplies in those two backpacks. They\nwere the richest of all 15 backpacks,\ncontaining supplies worth nearly 50,000.\nFongu glanced at Song Jumming and asked\nwith a half smile. Fatty, I remember you\ntold me before that all your assets were\nthose 2,000 pieces of timber. How come\nyou suddenly have so many supplies? This\nsong Jming smiled somewhat awkwardly and\nsaid, \"It was my fault. I lied to you,\nbrother Fong before. After all, there's\nan old saying, don't flaunt your wealth,\nright?\" Huh? Fongu chuckled calmly. Are\nyou afraid that if I find out you have\nso many supplies, I'll take advantage of\nyour misfortune. He Song Jimming\nchuckled slightly. To be honest, I was a\nlittle scared back then, but I'm not\nscared anymore. Brother Fong, you saved\nme twice, so my life is yours now.\nEverything I own is yours, too. Fongu\nwas quite satisfied with Song Jumming,\nwho repeatedly pledged his loyalty. But\nhe still kept a watchful eye on him and\nturned to look at Ryan. As an undead\ncreature, Ryan has certainly lived much\nlonger than him, so his judgment of\npeople should naturally be more accurate\nthan his own. Ryan seemed to understand\nFong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s meaning and nodded\nslightly. Fong Yu then said, \"All right,\nsince that's the case, let's proceed\naccording to plan. Pack up the supplies\nand let's head back to the Yorktown\nruins. Huh? Song Jimming asked, puzzled.\nWhy go back? Of course, we&lt;unk&gt;ll\nestablish a settlement there. Go now.\nOtherwise, what? How long are you\nplanning to wait? Fong retorted.\nBesides, your house just happened to\nburn down, right? Since you're going to\nrebuild anyway, why not pick a good\nlocation in that ruin and rebuild there?\nSong Jimming pointed to the 15 backpacks\non the ground and said, \"But we can't\ncarry all of these backpacks.\" Upon\nhearing this, Fong Yu smiled slightly\nand said, \"It's all right. My partner is\nvery capable.\" As for just how strong\nRyan was, Fongu didn't actually know.\nAnyway, it can still leap across a river\nnearly 10 m wide while carrying a grown\nman like him. And that's not even its\nlimit. So, 15 backpacks are not a\nproblem for it at all. It's just that\nits body doesn't seem to be able to\ncarry 15 backpacks at once. So, a moment\nlater, Ryan led a large adult wild boar\nout of the woods. Seeing the not yet\nfully healed gash on the adult boar's\nforehead, Fong Yu knew that Ryan must\nhave killed the boar and then\nresurrected it as a zombie. However,\nSong Jimming was unaware of this and\nexclaimed in surprise, \"Wow, Brother\nFong, your servant can actually tame\nbeasts.\" Upon hearing this, Fong Yu\ntwitched the corner of his mouth and\nreplied, \"Yeah, it knows a lot of\nthings.\" Song Jimming had no doubts. He\nimmediately pulled out a bunch of\nmaterials from his backpack, made a\nsaddle using a crafting table, and then\nwith Ryan's help, placed it on the bore\nzombie. Finally, he tied all 15\nbackpacks to the saddle. It worked this\ntime. Song Jim clapped his hands and\nsaid, \"Hey, that makes things much\neasier.\" So half an hour later, they\nreturned to the ruins of Yorktown. This\ntime, there were no more pigheaded men\noutside the ruins, so they went directly\ninside the city walls and truly entered\nthe ruins of Yorktown. Looking around,\nthe condition of the ruins was much\nbetter than Fongu had expected. Although\nthe roads were overgrown with weeds and\nmore than half of the houses were just\nruins, there were still quite a few\nrelatively intact houses. However, in\nfront of or inside those intact houses,\nthere were more or less some corpses of\nSAS and piglets lying around. The 20 odd\npigman zombies that Ryan brought had\nalready been quietly moved away by Ryan.\n\"Go and dispose of those bodies,\" Fong\nYu said to Song Jimming, pointing to the\ncorpses on the ground. \"I'm going\noutside for some fresh air.\" After\nsaying that, Fong Yu walked out of the\nruins of Yorktown. He didn't want to\nface the corpses of those sows and\npiglets, so he preferred not to have\nthose pieces of meat. Looking at the\nfarmland being cultivated by the\npigheaded people outside the city walls,\nFongu shook his head and muttered,\n\"Sigh. They're&lt;unk&gt; still not\ncold-blooded enough. In fact, these pig\npeople were the native inhabitants of\nthis place while he was just an\noutsider.\" As soon as he arrived, he\nslaughtered all of these pig people and\ntook over the town ruins. This reminded\nFong Yu of the crimes that the Americans\ncommitted against the Native Americans\nin the Americas. In essence, what Fong\nYu did was no different from what the\nAmerican people did. Invasion and\nmassacre followed by the seizure of\nresources and land. If one insists on\nmaking excuses for themselves, then it's\nsimply that these pigheaded people can't\nbe considered human and that they even\neat humans. Half an hour later,\nFattySong came out after clearing the\ncorpses from the ruins and said\nexcitedly, \"Brother Fong, this place is\nabsolutely amazing. I just walked around\nand found that there is a river to the\nwest, a flax field to the north, a large\nfarmland to the south, and an orchard to\nthe east. The resources are just too\nabundant.\" Fongu smiled slightly after\nlistening and said, \"That's perfect. You\nshould think of a good way to phrase it.\nthen post the situation here in the\nsupport group and then organize people\nto come over. It's noon now. You still\nhave half a day to clean up this area.\nSong Jimming nodded repeatedly and began\nto operate the chat interface. So, with\nnothing to do, Fong Yu took Alpha and\nstarted wandering around the area. He\nplanned to circle the area within 500\nmeters of Yorktown to see if there were\nany potential dangers. As for Ryan,\nFongu had him take the 20 odd pigheaded\nzombies back to the mine first. He\ndidn't want others to know that Ryan had\nthe ability to resurrect the dead\nbecause this ability was too overpowered\nand too frightening and might even\nprovoke a mob attack. Therefore, Fong Yu\ndecided to quietly accumulate strength\nand build a zombie army. He would reveal\nhis power when he was no longer afraid\nof any external factors. By evening, Fu\nhad circled the entire area around the\nruins and was basically certain that\nthere were no major threats nearby, but\nthere were still many dangerous places\nsuch as wolf dens and bear caves. He\ntold Fattyong their locations one by\none. After an afternoon of activity,\nFattyong successfully persuaded several\nhundred people in the fan club to come\nto the ruins of this small town tomorrow\nto establish a settlement. In this way,\nFong Yu's plan was basically half\nsuccessful. The rest depended on how\nFatty Song performed. As for the\nsupplies and the 15 backpacks, Fong Yu\nonly took a few as a token gesture and\nleft the rest behind. Rebuilding this\nplace will probably require a lot of\nresources. Since I plan to turn this\nplace into a gathering place for Fong\nYu's support group players, I should do\nmy part. These supplies are for you, but\ndon't you dare embezzle them. Fong Yu\ninstructed Song Jimming. Hey, no way.\nSong Jimming laughed. Don't worry, boss.\nI'll definitely rebuild this place\nwithin 3 days. Great. I'm really looking\nforward to it. Before it got dark, Fong\nYu went to the mine to meet up with Ryan\nand together they returned to their\nmanor before nightfall. As soon as Fong\nYu entered the manor, he saw Valentina\nfloating by the door of the wooden\nhouse, eagerly waiting. After seeing him\nreturn, Valentina patted her chest and\nsaid, \"Master, why are you so late? I\nthought something had happened. I was so\nscared. Fong Yu looked at the lovely\nghost girl and smiled slightly. I'm\nsorry to have worried you. I've been\nvery busy today. I haven't had a moment\nto rest. Ryan and the dog standing\nnearby nodded in agreement. Valentina\nnodded and replied with a smile. Okay,\nokay, I know. Let's talk inside. I've\nalready prepared dinner, so you can talk\nto me while you eat. Oh, is dinner\nready? I was wondering why it smelled so\ngood. Let me smell it. Is it mushroom\nand pork soup? What else? And we also\nhave your favorite dumplings with\ncabbage and pork filling. Why is it all\npork? Funu felt a little annoyed. After\nkilling so many pigheaded men today,\nFongu really had no interest in pork.\nHow about we make some other dishes? No\nproblem, master. What would you like to\neat? Valentina asked. Anything is fine\nas long as it's not related to pork.\nSoon, Fong went to the bathroom to\nchange his clothes and bore armor. Then\nhe used the hot water that Valentina had\nprepared for him to rinse himself and\nAlpha. He had originally planned to ask\nRyan to take a shower with him, but Ryan\nrefused. A short while later, Fong Yu\nand Alfa finished their showers and sat\ndown at the table. At that moment,\nValentina used her magic to float out of\nthe kitchen carrying several dishes.\n\"Time to eat,\" Valentina said with a\nsmile. \"I can't wait.\" After the dishes\nwere served, Fun Yu immediately picked\nup his chopsticks, ready to taste the\ndumplings Valentina had made. Just then,\nthe door to Ryan's room suddenly opened,\nand a tall and beautiful figure appeared\nin the doorway. Just as Fong Yu picked\nup a dumpling and was about to put it to\nhis mouth, he glanced towards Ryan's\ndoor, and then smack, the dumpling that\nFong Yu was holding fell onto the table.\nChapter 100. Holy crap, Bungu is here.\ngolden waves, layered peaks, a wasp\nwaist like an hourglass, and long,\nslender legs. If it weren't for the\nmeager amount of burlap strips used to\nwrap his chest and groin area, Fong Yu\nestimated he would have had a nose bleed\nof 300 ml on the spot. Even so, Fong Yu\nfelt his blood pressure instantly spike\nby 50 units. Ah, this Fong Yu stared in\ndisbelief at the blonde, blue-eyed woman\nwho emerged from Ryan's room. Good\nevening, Master Olivia Lane greets you.\nThe blonde woman smiled and gave Fong Yu\na slight bow, then puffed out her proud\nchest and sat down opposite him. Fongu\ntook a deep breath, suppressing his\nfurrowed brows and exclaimed in\nsurprise, \"You're Ryan?\" The blonde\nwoman smiled and nodded. Her perfect\nface, as if drawn by Leonardo da Vinci,\ncombined with her dashing and heroic\ndemeanor, made Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s breath\ncatch in his throat. You're actually a\nwoman. Fong Yu put down his chopsticks\nand stood up excitedly. Seeing Fong\nYu&lt;unk&gt;s reaction, Ryan was also\nslightly taken aback, wondering why Fong\nYu was so excited. At this moment, Fong\nYu pointed at Ryan with grief and\nindignation and said, \"I treated you\nlike a sworn brother, but you're\nactually a girl.\" Valentina, who was\nstanding nearby, chuckled and said, \"He\nmaster, you can't blame Ryan for this.\nShe never said she was a man from\nbeginning to end. Upon careful\nconsideration, Fongu realized that it\nwas indeed true. From the moment he\nfirst saw the skeleton that was taller\nthan himself, he subconsciously assumed\nthat Ryan was a man. After all, he was\nnearly 1.8 m tall. So Ryan must have\nbeen over 1.9 m tall. He even once\nthought that Ryan's original form was a\nmuscular giant like an iron tower. But\nthe result was But the result was a\nwoman with long golden waves and an\namazing figure. Thinking of this, Fong\nYu helplessly sat back down in his\nchair, chuckled self-deprecatingly, and\nsaid, \"You're right. I was wrong from\nthe start.\" At this moment, Ryan\ncautiously asked, \"Master, do you not\nlike how I look now? Perhaps I should go\nback and wrap myself up again.\" He then\nbegan to get up. Please, Dumadai. Fongu\nwaved his hand and said in a deep voice.\nIt's not that I don't like it, it's just\nthat I'm not used to it. Well, let's eat\nnow. Woof. Alfa responded from the side,\nusing its paw to hook a piece of roasted\nmeat and put it into the plate in front\nof it, ready to eat. At this moment,\nFunyu seemed to have thought of\nsomething again and turned to look at\nGuzy. Are you female, too? Upon hearing\nthis, Alpha immediately began shaking\nits head frantically. So, it's male.\nAlpha nodded repeatedly. No, I'm not\ncomfortable with that. It's better to\ncheck carefully. With that, Fongu tried\nto lift Alpha's hind legs, which\nstartled Alpha so much that it dropped\nthe roasted meat in its mouth and jumped\noff the chair with a whale. I treat you\nlike a brother, and you actually want to\nlook at my little brother. Alpha's\nfavorability towards you has decreased\nby 20. Current favorability 280. Upon\nseeing the notification popped up by the\ngame assistant, Fong Yu raised an\neyebrow. He hadn't expected the\nfavorability rating to drop. Fong Yu\nthen glanced at Alpha apologetically and\nsaid, \"He, I was just kidding. Don't\ntake it seriously. I'll eat your food\nback and forth.\" Alfa returned to his\nchair with some skepticism, and only\nafter Fongu made no further move against\nhim did he bury his head in eating the\nbarbecue. Fongu gave Ryan another\nserious look and said, \"So, your full\nname is Olivia.\" Ryan. \"Yes, master. I\nalways thought Ryan was a man's name.\nRyan is my surname. Olivia is my first\nname. Then I'll call you Olivia from now\non.\" Calling you Ryan feels weird. Call\nme whatever you like. Olivia smiled\nsweetly. Let's eat. Let's eat. So,\ndinner ended hastily in such an awkward\natmosphere. As soon as he finished\neating, Fong Yu went to the crafting\ntable and made a set of ordinary linen\nclothes, which he then gave to Olivia.\nAfter all, having a girl with an amazing\nfigure constantly parading around in\nfront of you while only covering her\nchest and hips is really torturous,\nespecially since Fong Yu is still a\nvirgin. After Olivia finished getting\ndressed, Fong Yu finally felt the\nawkward atmosphere ease a little.\nValentina then brought out the book of\nthe evil god, intending to feed the guy\nwith her unfinished dinner and see what\ngood stuff he could produce today. When\nFong You saw the book of evil gods, he\nsuddenly remembered that he had killed\n21 players during the day, which should\nhave given him 21 honor points. So, he\nshould be able to draw a prize again. He\nopened his attribute panel and saw that\nhis honor points had reached 90.\nPreviously, I only had 10 honor points.\nSo, the remaining 80 points were\ncontributed by the group of people from\nthe Dong Sean gang that I killed today,\nas well as the group that robbed Song\nJimming. 80 points. This means 80 lives\nlost. Oh well, whatever. Anyway, I've\nunknowingly given myself several more\nchances to win a prize. I'll stop\nthinking about it. So, Fongu first fed\nthe Book of Evil God with the leftover\npork and mushroom soup and cabbage and\npork dumplings. After eating and\ndrinking his fill, the book of evil gods\nspit out a soft black thing on the table\nand then transformed back into an\nordinary magic book. Funu, suppressing\nhis nausea, picked up the black object\ncovered in slime, but couldn't figure\nout what it was. So, he tried pulling it\nwith his fingers. The black thing was\nslowly stretched out, and then its color\ngradually faded. Looking at the black\nobject in his hand that was stretching\nlonger and longer, Fongu had a guess in\nhis mind. The game assistant then\nprovided the answer. Dark demon\nstockings. Yellow stockings woven from\nthe silk of dark spider demons\npossessing extremely high magic\nresistance properties, making them a top\ntier defensive magical equipment for\nfemale mages. Fongu was stunned. I'm\ntotally stunned. Why would I vomit\nsomething like this? He can't use this\nthing either. Although it's described as\na top tier yellow grade equipment, and\nthe equipment description even states\nthat it's for female mages. Actually,\nmale mages can use it, too. Huh? Huh?\nDream on. Fongu angrily threw the black\nstockings in his hand onto the table,\nasking him to wear black stockings.\nAbsolutely not. At that moment, Fong Yu\nsuddenly thought of something and turned\nto look at Valentina. Isn't she a\nmagician? However, she seems to be in a\nsoul state right now, so she probably\ncan't wear it, right? At this moment,\nValentina also recognized the black\nstockings on the table. She glanced at\nFong Yu, covered her mouth, and\nchuckled, \"Sorry, master. I can't wear\nthese right now.\" Fong Yu sighed\nhelplessly, and said, \"Oh, well, never\nmind. Just keep it for now. You can wear\nit when you've recovered your physical\nbody.\" However, Valentina shook her head\nand said, \"Although I can't wear it yet,\nthere are others who can.\" As she spoke,\nValentina looked at Olivia laying beside\nher, or more precisely, at Olivia's\nlong, slender, shapely, Snow White, and\nstraight legs. Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s gaze\nfollowed Valentina's and upon seeing\nOlivia's perfectly long legs and then\nimagining how those legs would look in\nblack stockings. Holy crap, Bungu is\nhere. Fong Yu immediately bent over,\ncovered his nose, and rushed into his\nbedroom. Chapter 101. The Shura field of\nthe night. Back in his bedroom, Fong Yu\ntossed and turned in bed for a long time\nbefore finally managing to calm down the\nburning desire in his heart. Even now,\nhe still finds it hard to believe that\nRyan is actually a woman and a\nstunningly beautiful woman at that. Just\nthinking about Olivia's body simply\nwrapped in a few bandages made Fong Yu\nfeel the heat. He had finally managed to\nsuppress return. So Fong Yu forced\nhimself to change position, muttering,\n\"Damn, I can't take this anymore.\" At\nthis moment in the living room outside,\nafter listening to the sounds coming\nfrom Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s bedroom and\nconfirming that Fongu was already in\nbed, Valentino waved her hand to create\na soundproof barrier in the living room.\nThen she glanced at Olivia and said,\n\"Are you deliberately trying to seduce\nyour master?\" However, Olivia shrugged\nindifferently and said, \"I'm not as\ncunning as you. I just changed all the\nbandages that were stained with blood,\nbut I didn't have enough clean bandages,\nso I could only wrap this much. Don't\nyou think about it? If I really wanted\nto seduce him, I could have just come\nout naked. Why go through all this\ntrouble? Valentina glared at Olivia and\nteased. Don't you know that you're more\nalluring when you're half covered up\nthan when you're naked? Olivia paused\nfor a moment upon hearing this, then\nturned to the dog beside her and asked,\n\"Is that so?\" Alpha glanced at the two\nwomen, rolled its eyes, and scured back\ninto its kennel, thinking to itself,\n\"What's it to me?\" In its eyes, these\ntwo women were less attractive than a\npiece of meat. Seeing that the dog was\ntoo lazy to get involved, Valentina\nrolled her eyes at Olivia again and\nsaid, \"I see that you and your master\nare both covered in the aura of death.\nDid you kill someone today?\" Olivia\nnodded and said calmly. They killed\ndozens of humans and also killed more\nthan 200 pig men in the Yorktown ruins.\nSo much Valentina was somewhat\nsurprised, but then she realized what\nwas happening and looked at Olivia's\nbody, saying, \"No wonder you recovered\nso quickly. So, you can go to the\nkilling grounds now to absorb the soul\npower of the dead. Maybe you can even\nrestore your physical body tonight. O, I\nknow without you saying it. Lead the\nway,\" Valentina replied irritably,\nOlivia said impatiently. \"Can't I just\ntell you the location and you go there\nyourself?\" \"No, why? I'm afraid you'll\nsneak into your master's bed while I'm\nnot around,\" Valentina said\nsarcastically. \"Huh? I'm not as\nshameless as you,\" Olivia retorted. \"Say\nit again.\" Valentina's pupils flashed\nwith purple light and her long hair\nswayed slowly behind her. However,\nOlivia, unfazed, crossed her arms and\ncontinued to mock. A few days ago, I\ndon't know who was wearing a skirt and\nswaying around on Master's head everyday\nand even peeping at Master while he was\ntaking a bath. Now, you have the nerve\nto say that I'm seducing Master. Humph.\nIf you weren't in a spirit state, you'd\nprobably have already crawled into\nMaster's bed. Valentina's eyes blazed\nwith purple light after being hit where\nit hurt. and an extremely complex and\ndazzling six-pointed star magic circle\nappeared on her forehead, indicating\nthat she was truly angry. Olivia was\nequally determined. A dark green lion's\nshadow emerged from her chest, its jaws\nwide open, and it let out a silent roar\nat Valentina. The two powerful forces\ncollided in an instant, and the entire\nwooden house began to shake. Alpha,\nsensing something was wrong, immediately\nran to Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s bedroom door and\nfrantically started pulling at the\ndoororknob, seemingly trying to hide\ninside. At that moment, Fong Yu, who was\nin the bedroom, also felt the shaking of\nthe wooden house. He immediately jumped\nout of bed, rushed to the bedroom door,\nand opened it. As soon as the door\nopened, Alfa rushed into Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s\narms, startling him. The dog made low\ngrowls as if trying to say something to\nFong Yu, but Fong Yu couldn't understand\nwhat it was saying. Fong Yu looked out\nthrough the open door and saw Valentina\nfloating beside the fireplace, using\nmagic to pick up a piece of wood and add\nit to the fire while Olivia was\nsharpening her rusty iron axe with a wet\nstone. Everything seems normal. Did the\nhouse shake just now? Fongu asked\ntentatively. \"Oh, you mean the house\nshook just now?\" Valentina looked at\nFong Yu with her adorable big eyes and\nsaid, \"No, everything is fine, master.\nYou can ask Ryan if you don't believe\nme.\" Fong Yu then looked at Olivia, who\nnodded slightly and said, \"Everything is\nnormal, master. I think you might have\nbeen hallucinating just now.\" \"Is that\nso?\" Fong Yu raised an eyebrow slightly,\nlooked down at the dog in his arms, and\nthe dog stared at him with its big eyes,\nshaking its head desperately. At this\nmoment, Valentina said to the dog,\n\"Alpha, stop being naughty and get off\nyour master. Your master has been tired\nall day, and you can't disturb your\nmaster's rest.\" Upon hearing this, Alpha\nfelt a chill run down its spine. After\nmuch deliberation, it jumped off Fong\nYu&lt;unk&gt;s arms and darted back to its\ndoghouse. Fong Yu looked at his three\ncompanions in the living room and felt\nthat something was off, but he couldn't\nquite put his finger on it. So he asked\nagain, \"Are you sure nothing's wrong?\"\n\"It's really nothing. Don't worry,\nmaster.\" Valentina smiled. \"Oh, by the\nway, I might have to go out with Ryan\nlater. Alpha will stay home with you.\"\n\"Oh, okay. No problem.\" Fongu naturally\nknew that Valentina was going to the\ndaytime killing ground to absorb soul\npower. So, he didn't ask any further\nquestions. \"I'm going to sleep now.\"\n\"Okay, good night, master.\" Valentina\nwaved her little hand at Fong Yu and\nmade a cute expression. Only after Fongu\nclosed the bedroom door did Olivia put\ndown the iron axe in her hand and\nsneered at Valentina with disdain.\nDisgusting.\nI call this alluring. It's clearly just\nprovocative behavior. You can't learn\nthat. You tomboy. Who are you calling a\ntomboy? Who else do you think I could\naccuse? Olivia picked up the iron axe\nbeside her again and said coldly, \"You\nreally want to fight, don't you?\" \"Fine,\nlet's&lt;unk&gt; fight. Are you afraid of me?\nLet's go outside and fight so as not to\ndisturb the master any further.\" \"Oh,\nthat's exactly what I was thinking,\ntoo.\" Then a gust of wind howled past,\nand two figures rushed out of the wooden\nhouse, speeding towards the distant\nwoods. Hearing the noise, Fong Yu got up\nagain, opened the door, and looked\noutside, only to see Guy closing the\ndoor at the front gate. \"What exactly is\ngoing on?\" Fong Yu asked, closing the\ndoor, and crawled into its kennel, not\nwanting to answer Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s\nquestion. Chapter 1. Three consecutive\nlottery draws. Fong Yu returned to his\nroom with doubts, ready to go to sleep.\nBut then he remembered that he seemed to\nhave eight lottery chances left to use.\nSo he used his mind to contact the game\nassistant and asked it to bring up the\nlottery system. Please select the\nCurrently there are three categories\nThree, job skills. Looking at the three\noptions, Funu fell into deep thought. He\ndoesn't need pets for now, but as for\nprofessional skills, he already has the\nbook of evil god. As long as he feeds\nhim some food everyday, he can vomit up\nsome things related to his profession.\nAlthough the things this thing spews out\nare a bit unpredictable, sometimes\ngiving alchemy notes, sometimes black\nstockings, it's still enough. Therefore,\nFongu focused his attention on supplies.\nAfter all, he had already upgraded to\nthe manor on the first day of spring,\nbut now it was autumn and he hadn't even\nconsidered upgrading the manor. It\nseemed like it was time to consider\nupgrading again since the manor was his\nfoundation in this survival game.\nTherefore, Fong Yu chose the material\ncategory prize, hoping to obtain more\nconstruction materials. The prize\ncategory has been determined. Supplies.\nThe draw will now begin. As the game\nassistant subtitles disappeared, the air\nin front of Fong Yu's bed underwent a\nfamiliar yet eerie distortion, followed\nby the opening of a huge dark crack.\nthat familiar tentacle monster lottery\nroulette will popped up. Holy crap, it's\nyou again. Fong Yu exclaimed excitedly\nas he looked at the evil gods roulette.\nYou damn bastard. What kind of artifact\ndid you give me last time? The tentacle\nmonster raised its pointer and beckoned\nslightly to Fongu, ignoring his\naccusations and began spinning the wheel\non its own. Incidentally, the large\npurplish black eyeball in the center of\nthe roulette wool started winking at\nFong Yu, its meaning quite clear. Did he\nhave anything good to offer as a bribe?\nAfter a moment of silence, Fong Yu\nopened the warehouse and began browsing.\nThis guy seems to like eating meat. He\nhappened to have killed nearly a 100\npigheaded men in the depression today\nand got more than a 100 pieces of meat.\nHe wouldn't eat the meat himself, so he\nstarted taking it out to feed the\nroulette wheel. piece. Two pieces. After\nbeing fed 20 pieces of meat, the\ntentacle pointer finally let out a\nsatisfied burp. Immediately, the pointer\nlanded in the red area as Fongu had\nhoped. Congratulations on winning the\nprize. Ice Goddess's magic refrigerator\none magic crystal 100. Then, with a\nthump, a large purplish black cabinet\nalmost as tall as Fong Yu appeared in\nfront of him. Ice Goddess's magic\nrefrigerator red providing one magic\ncrystal will keep food inside the\nrefrigerator from spoiling for up to one\nyear. You can also keep some\ncoldresistant animals inside. Huh? This\nbroken refrigerator is supposed to be a\nred tier artifact. Are you serious? Fanu\nglanced at the tentacle monster's\nroulette wheel and thought to himself.\nIs this guy trying to trick me again?\nWhat exactly is a magic crystal? Magic\ncrystals? These are magic crystals\nformed by mages infusing empty elemental\ncrystals with magical power. They can be\nused to restore magical power or to give\nmagical equipment functions. Fongu\nwanted to open the magic refrigerator in\nfront of him to find out what was\ninside. But suddenly an eyeball and a\ntentacle popped out of the refrigerator\nand started waving at Fong Yu. Judging\nfrom that familiar face, it was\nobviously trying to get something from\nFong Yu. Fong Yu picked up a magic\ncrystal from the ground and stuffed it\ninto the tentacle's mouth. At this\nmoment, the purplish black membrane\nwrapped around the surface of the\nrefrigerator slowly shrank to the top of\nthe refrigerator, turning into a small\ntentacle monster the size of a palm, and\nthe refrigerator revealed its original\nappearance. To be honest, at first\nglance, this refrigerator looks no\ndifferent from a real refrigerator. It\nhas a metallic exterior, is divided into\nupper and lower sections, and is a\ndouble door type. Funu first tried\nopening the refrigerator door.\nEverything inside was normal, and the\ntemperature was close to 0° C, so it\nshould be fine for keeping food fresh.\nFong Yu then opened the refrigerator\ndoor below and this time a fierce biting\nwind howled out of the refrigerator door\ncarrying a lot of snowflakes which blew\nFong Yu away and sent him flying\nbackward crashing into the wall. Holy\ncrap. Seeing that something was wrong,\nFong Yu, who had fallen to the ground,\nimmediately rushed to the refrigerator\ndespite the biting cold wind and slammed\nthe refrigerator door shut. The cold\nwind stopped abruptly. Fong Yu leaned\nagainst the bed, panting heavily,\nbrushing the snowflakes off his body,\nutterly shocked, he had just seen\nclearly that behind the lower\nrefrigerator door was a vast, boundless\nice field. At this moment, he finally\nunderstood why such a broken\nrefrigerator was considered a magical\nartifact. Because it contained an entire\nice and snow world, an item capable of\ncontaining a world is undoubtedly a\ndivine artifact. I wonder how big that\nicy world is and whether there are any\ntreasures or monsters inside. Looks like\nI'll have to get a lock on the bottom\nrefrigerator door later just in case. At\nthis moment, the ice and snow on Fong\nYu's body melted into ice water, which\nseeped into his clothes, making him\nshiver. Although he hadn't caught a cold\nsince entering the game, he couldn't\nrule out the possibility of catching\none. So, he went out of the room and\nwent to the fireplace to warm himself.\nAlpha inside the doghouse, looked at\nFong Yu, who was covered in water,\ncompletely bewildered. He thought to\nhimself, \"My master has great\nwillpower.\" He actually drenched himself\nin water just to cool me down. \"I admire\nyou.\" After his clothes dried\ncompletely, Fongu returned to his\nbedroom only to find that the spinning\nlottery tentacle monster was still there\nand the disc was still spinning. Fongu\nthen remembered that he still had two\nchances to draw a prize. When Fong Yu\narrived in front of the wheel, the wheel\nbegan to decelerate rapidly, stopping\nthis time in a blue square.\nCongratulations on winning the prize. 10\ncases of Master Kong pickled cabbage\nnoodles and 100 bottles of very cola.\nHoly crap. Fongu was dumbfounded. Why\nare these things here? Shouldn't they\nstill be red? Suddenly, one of the wheel\ntentacle monsters raised a sign that\nread artifact sold out. Forget it.\nGetting one artifact is already pretty\ngood. I can't be greedy. So, Fong Yu\ncontinued the lottery draw and he still\nhad six chances left. Congratulations on\nwinning the prize. 10 packs of soft\ncigarettes and 100 packs of caramel\nbeetle nuts. Holy crap, this\ncombination. Fongu raised his eyebrows,\nbut then frowned again. What the hell is\nthis supply? What I need are the\nbuilding materials for upgrading the\nwooden house. So, he continued with the\nlottery draw. Congratulations on winning\nthe prize. 100 Viagra pills and 10 boxes\nof ultra thin spiral umbrellas. Fong Yu\nstared into deep thought as he looked at\nwhat the lottery compass was spewing\nout. This is What the hell are\nyou doing? What is all this junk? Fongu\nglared at the lottery wheel and said, \"I\nwant to upgrade the building materials\nfor my house. I don't want this mess.\"\nUpon hearing this, the lottery will\nproduced another small wooden sign that\nread, \"You should have said so earlier.\nThis time, the tentacle pointer stopped\nin a yellow square. Congratulations on\nwinning the following prizes: 5,000\nwood, 3,000 gravel, 1,000 rot tan, and\n500 iron ingots.\" \"That's right.\" Fongu\nsmiled and said, \"Continue. Chapter 103.\nHow dare someone steal my territory. In\nthe following rounds of the lottery, all\nthe winnings arranged by the roulette\nmonster were various building materials.\nIn five rounds, Fong Yu won nearly\n100,000 resources. Adding the resources\nhe had saved up before and the spoils he\nhad collected today, Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s total\nresources are now close to 300,000. He\nopened the house upgrade system, which\nhe hadn't looked at in a long time.\nHaunted Manner, one star. Three\none bathroom, one yard. 100sqm interior,\n100sqm yard. Haunted Manor 2ar, three\none bathroom, one yard. 130sqm interior,\n200sqm yard. Upgrade requirements with\n66880/000.\nGravel 34550/2000\nmud 6300500\nvines 6360/300\nbones 455/500\nSpecial items beast remains 0/1\ntombstones 0/10 magic crystals 100/10\ncannot be upgraded Haunted Manner two\nstar unlocks Monster Hut undead\ngraveyard 10 undead basement 1 30sqm.\nMonster hunt can be used to house\nvarious pets or monsters. Current\ncapacity 0/3 can be upgraded\nindividually. Undead graveyard can be\nused to store remains, resurrecting\ncorpses to become undead. Current\ncapacity 0/10\ncan be upgraded individually. Undead\nbasement. A basement where the dead can\nrest in peace. A special necromantic\narray can keep the spirits together and\nprevent them from dissipating. Current\ncapacity 0/10 can be upgraded\nindividually. After reading the upgrade\nrequirements for man or two stars, Fongu\ngasped, \"How the hell did these three\nweird things suddenly appear? A monster\nhut, an undead graveyard, and a ghost\nbasement.\" Funu frowned. How did it\nbecome a haunted manor? After all\nplayers houses are upgraded to manor, a\ntech tree will be unlocked, allowing\nthem to choose from technology, magic,\ncreatures, runes, shinik powers, etc.\nSince the haunted house you inherited\nalready has a tech tree, the system\nautomatically upgraded it to haunted\nmanor for you. Only after the game\nassistant reminded him did Fongu realize\nthat he had inherited a haunted house in\nthe woods. It wasn't an ordinary house.\nAlpha is a hellhound with demonic blood.\nRyan is an undead race born from\nskeletons. Valentina is still a ghost.\nTisk. Tisk. I've been having such a\ncomfortable time these past few days\nthat I've almost forgotten what this\nhouse originally looked like. Fongu\nshook his head with a self-deprecating\nlaugh. Haunted manner it is. Anyway, he\nseems to have a special connection with\nthese ghosts. There are 10 ghost miners\nand dozens of zombies living in the mine\nin the woods to the north. They all have\nan inseparable relationship with him.\nFong Yu accepted the upgrade path for\nthe house and began to study what\nmaterials were still missing. He had all\nthe basic building materials except for\nmud and bones. The key was the last\nthree special items. The remains of a\nbehemoth, a tombstone, and magic\ncrystals. I already got some magic\ncrystals from the lottery. As for\ntombstones, there seem to be cemeteries\nin the ruins of Yorktown. If that\ndoesn't work, I can just dig up 10\ntomorrow and bring them back. As for\nwhat exactly this giant beast's remains\nare, skeletons of giant beasts, the\nremains of enormous monsters exceeding\n10 m in size. Although rare, they are\nnot difficult to find. Not hard to find.\nThen tell me where it is. 5 km south on\nthe mountain, there is a dragon's lair\ninside which lies the skeleton of a\ngiant dragon. Fong Yu rolled his eyes,\nthinking to himself, \"Can't you find me\nsomething easier? Going to the dragon's\nlayer is just suicide for me.\" In the\nunderground palaces of the underworld,\nthere are also the remains of giant\nbeasts. Let's try another one. Going\neast into the spider forest, there is a\nspider cave containing the skeleton of a\ngiant demon patterned spider. A giant\nspider with a magical pattern. Fong Yu\nhad never heard of such a thing. But if\nit was a spider cave, he felt that with\nhis current strength and the protection\nof Olivia Lane and Alpha the dog, he\nshould be able to venture into it. It's\nsettled then. We&lt;unk&gt;ll go to the spider\ncave tomorrow to get the giant beast\nskeleton. Early in the morning, Fongu\nwas woken up by the beeping sounds from\nhis friend list. He impatiently opened\nthe list and saw that Song Jiming was\nbombarding him with messages. Song\nJiming ID3533.\nBrother Fong, something terrible has\nhappened. Someone in the fan club has\nleaked the information about the\nYorktown ruins. Song Jimming ID 3533.\nWake up. Don't sleep. Song Jiming ID\n3533. Several forces have already set\ntheir sights on that land. They're\nsaying there should be fair competition.\nThey all say whoever occupies it first\ngets to control the territory. Song\njimming ID 3533. Dear brother, wake up.\nHey. Song jamming ID 3533.\nGet up quickly. Let's organize some\npeople to seize it. We finally managed\nto kill those pigheaded men yesterday.\nWe can't let others steal our spoils.\nUpon seeing this, Fun Yu immediately\ncame to his senses. Holy crap. Someone\nactually dared to steal my territory.\nHow could anyone tolerate this? Without\na word, Fongu sprang out of bed quickly\ndressed and rushed out of the bedroom,\nshouting into the living room. Ryan,\nAlpha, grab your weapons. Get ready for\na fight. Upon hearing this, Alpha\nimmediately jumped out of the kennel,\nshook its fur, and stood in front of\nFong Yu, ready to go. However, Ryan was\nnowhere to be found. Not only Ryan, but\neven Valentina, who usually prepares\nbreakfast for herself early in the\nmorning, didn't see it. Huh? Where are\nthey? Fong Yu asked Alfa in surprise,\nlooking down at him. They didn't go out\nlast night and haven't come back yet,\ndid they? Upon hearing this, Alfa shook\nhis head, then silently turned to look\nat Ryan and Valentina's room. Just then,\nthe door to Ryan's room opened, and\nRyan, now completely wrapped in burlap\nbandages, appeared in the doorway,\ncarrying the rusty iron axe in his hand.\nFong Yu looked Ryan up and down and\nasked in surprise, \"Didn't you grow back\nall the way? Why are you tied up again?\nI got a minor injury last night and need\nto rest and recover.\" Holy crap, Ryan's\ninjured. Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s eyes widened. But\nisn't he an undead? Doesn't he have\nincredibly strong regenerative\nabilities? A minor injury shouldn't have\ncaused her to react like this, right?\nWhat about Valentina? Funu asked again.\nShe was also slightly injured last night\nand is resting and recovering now. Fongu\nwas stunned. Did you and Valentina\nencounter some powerful monster last\nnight? Fong Yu asked worriedly. Sigh.\nIt's my fault. I should have gone with\nyou last night. Upon hearing this, Ryan\nfell silent while Alpha standing beside\nhim bit his lip tightly trying his best\nnot to laugh out loud. Then Fongu\nthought for a moment and said, \"Are you\nstill free to go out now? If not, you\ncan stay home and rest. Ryan waved his\nhand, raised the iron axe, and slung it\nover his shoulder, saying, \"Don't worry,\nmaster. There's no problem. Let's go.\nAre you sure there's no problem?\" \"No\nproblem at all. Um, the bandage on your\nchest has come undone.\" Chapter 104. I,\nLongish, am the first to disagree. After\nOlivia adjusted the bandages on her\nchest, Fong Yu, still worried, handed\nher a set of linen clothes to wear over\nher clothes. A little accidental\nexposure at home is fine, but to do it\nin public is inappropriate. After all,\nit's better to keep something out of the\nfamily. Just wear this for now. We might\nget into a fight later, and it would be\nreally embarrassing if the bandages came\nundone then,\" Fong Yu said. Olivia\nblushed slightly, nodded, took the\nclothes, and turned to put them on.\nAfter everything was settled, Fong Yu\nled Alpha and Ryan towards the Yorktown\nruins. Someone actually dares to try and\ntake my territory, although I usually\nkeep a low profile. Just because I don't\nshow my teeth doesn't mean I'm some kind\nof Hello Kitty. He now has dozens of\nexplosives on him. Is a magician and has\nthe undead warriors Olivia and Alpha,\nwho can take on a 100 men\nsingle-handedly. He's not afraid at all\nif a fight really breaks out. When Fong\nYu arrived at the riverbank, he felt a\nbit of a headache. It seemed he would\nhave to find a way to repair the broken\nstone bridge next time he came.\nOtherwise, it would be very\nuncomfortable to be soaking wet every\ntime he swam across. But then, Fong Yu\nsaw Ryan raise the iron axe in his hand\nand throw it towards the other side of\nthe river. The iron axe turned into an\narc of light and slashed at the opposite\nriverbank. Olivia then turned to Fong Yu\nand said, \"Master, hold on tight to me\nfor a moment.\" Fong Yu raised an\neyebrow, wondering what Olivia meant. He\nthen saw Olivia walk up to him, grab his\nwaist, lift him off the ground, and rush\ntowards the river. Holy crap. Fong Yu\nfinally realized what Olivia was up to.\nShe actually intended to hug me, and\njump across the river. This river is 10\nm wide. Before Fong Yu could stop her,\nOlivia had already rushed to the\nriverbank, leaped into the air, and\nsoared across to the other side of the\nriver. 3 seconds later, Alpha the dog\nwatched as Olivia landed safely on the\nopposite riverbank with Fong Yu. It\nsighed helplessly, no longer expecting\nOlivia to come back for it. So, it took\nthe initiative to swim across to the\nother side. After getting off the\nground, Funu looked at Olivia with great\nsurprise and asked, \"Has your strength\nimproved a lot?\" Olivia nodded and said,\n\"I've recovered about 1% of my former\nstrength. I feel like I've humiliated\nmyself again. Only 1%. How incredibly\nawesome must she have been? Could he be\na saint level expert?\" Overall, Fong Yu,\nas Olivia's master, was very happy with\nOlivia's significant improvement in\nstrength. At least he would be more\nconfident when facing players who came\nto take over his territory. Soon after,\nAlfa swam over from the river, and the\ntwo of them and the dog sped off toward\nthe ruins of Yorktown. After Fong Yu\npassed through the bushes where he had\nambushed the pigheaded men yesterday, he\nsaw that a large number of people had\ngathered in the open space outside the\nYorktown walls where the bonfire had\nbeen lit. From a distance, there were\nprobably no fewer than a hundred people,\nand more people were continuously\nemerging from the woods in all\ndirections and converging on that open\nspace. Upon closer inspection, it\nbecomes clear that the group is divided\ninto five distinct teams, each\ncautiously observing the others. Fongu\nglanced around and spotted Song Jimming\namong the largest group of people. So,\nhe led Olivia and Alfa over. As Fong Yu\napproached, he heard a tall bearded man\nwith a broadsword slung over his\nshoulder step out from one of the groups\nand shout menacingly at Song Jimming.\nHey Song, if you know what's good for\nyou, get out of my way. Hey, what? Song\nJimming retorted. Our Fongu support\ngroup discovered this spot first. So\nwhat if you found it? Such a good place\nis definitely going to be used to build\na lord city. Your Fongu doesn't plan to\nbecome a lord. So why is he still\noccupying such a good place? Why not\ngive it to our three kingdoms heroes\ngathering? At this moment, someone from\nanother group shouted, \"Why should we\ngive it to you three kingdoms heroes?\"\nOur Dong Guild is the largest player\ngroup in the entire region. Upon hearing\nthis, the bearded man carrying a\nbroadsword immediately sneered. \"Oh, you\nDong Sean guys dare to come here and try\nto seize territory? I heard that your\nboss, Situ Hanan, and his dozen or so\nhenchmen were all wiped out. So what?\nWe're still the biggest player group in\nthe entire region. You must be joking,\nFattyong shouted. How many people are\nthere in Dong Sean? At most a few\nhundred. Our Fong Yu support club has\n1,500 members. Who do you think is the\nbiggest player group? And let me tell\nyou, your boss Sidu Han and his gang\nmessed with our boss Fong Yu and got\nwiped out by him. You're talking\nnonsense. He thinks he can take on our\nboss Situ and his 20 brothers all by\nhimself. Stop bragging. You think I'm\nbragging? Fattyong jumped up and\nshouted. This is what our boss Fong Youu\nsaid himself. And yesterday he\nsingle-handedly wiped out more than 200\npigh-headed men in the Yorktown ruins. I\nsaw it with my own eyes. Song\nJimming&lt;unk&gt;s words immediately drew\nlaughter from many people. Haha. The\nbearded man from the Three Kingdoms\nHeroes Gathering slammed his broadsword\non the ground and roared. Fatty, there's\na limit to your bragging. Fong, you can\nkill over 200 pigheaded men all by\nhimself. I've seen those pigheaded men\nbefore. They're all over 2 m tall, weigh\nhundreds of kilograms, and they're all\narmed. Let alone over 250 of them could\nwipe out all 100 plus of us players\nhere. You're telling me, Fong, you can\nkill over 200 by himself? Are you\ninsulting our intelligence? Exactly. You\nbrainless fans are so good at praising\nyour idols. I could say I could take on\na dragon one- on-one. Hey, what's the\npoint of saying so much? If you're so\ncapable, let that fun you come out and\ntalk to us in person. I want to see if\nhe really has that ability. That's\nright. Everyone says he's the number one\nboss in this district. I, Longen, am the\nfirst to disagree. Let him come and\nfight me if he dares. Just then, a loud\nexplosion rang out in the open space\nbehind everyone, startling them so much\nthat they screamed and retreated. When\nthey turned around, they saw that\nsomething had blasted a large crater in\nthe open space behind them, and thick\nsmoke was slowly rising. At the same\ntime, a figure shimmering with\nmulticolored magical light emerged from\nthe thick smoke and stood before the\ncrowd. I just heard someone questioning\nmy abilities. Fong Yu glanced\ndisdainfully at the 100 plus people in\nthe room and said calmly, \"Who said\nthat? Step forward.\" For a moment,\neveryone was stunned. Only Song Jimming\nrushed towards Fong Yu as if he had seen\na savior, shouting, \"Holy crap, brother\nFong, you finally arrived.\" Upon hearing\nthis, everyone present immediately\nunderstood that the mysterious person\nradiating colorful light was none other\nthan the legendary big boss of District\n6, Fong Yu. Fong Yu gestured to Song\nJumming, who was rushing towards him,\nsignaling him to calm down. He then\nscanned everyone present and said\ncoldly, \"Where's the guy who said he\nwanted to fight me oneon-one? Long Rian,\nwhere are you? Get out here.\" Chapter\n105 winning people over with virtue.\nFong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s resounding rebuke silenced\nthe previously noisy scene as everyone\nwas stunned by his imposing aura. And\nthis was exactly the effect Fong Yu\nwanted. To this end, he even threw a\nbomb before his entrance to suppress the\nnoise of the shouters and make his\nentrance as stylish as possible. Then he\nwould target those who dared to\nchallenge him and as long as he could\ncleanly defeat the loudest ones. This\nturf war could be resolved as quickly as\npossible. This is the best solution he\ncan think of at the moment. Where's Long\nRit? Why isn't he coming out yet? Fong\nYu asked loudly again when no one in the\ncrowd responded to him. At this moment,\nsomeone in the crowd finally started to\negg him on. Before long, a player was\npushed forward by the person next to\nhim, who didn't forget to say, \"He is\nLong Retian.\" Fong Yu looked at the\nskinny, bean sprout-like young man who\nwas pushed out, who was less than 1.7 m\ntall, and a mocking smile appeared on\nhis lips. \"Oh, young man, you are Long\nRetian. I think your bone structure is a\nbit unusual.\" The skinny long Ritien\nlooked at Fong Yu, who was wearing a\nfull set of wild boar armor, his body\nshimmering with multicolored light and\nholding an iron axe with flame inscribed\nrunes. He immediately cowed. He\nswallowed hard and said awkwardly, Big\nBrother, I was just joking with you. A\njoke? Fong Yu looked coldly at Long\nRein, casually summoning a fireball and\nasking, since you like joking so much,\nthen I'll joke with you in my own way.\nAfter saying that, Fong Yu waved his\nhand lightly and the fireball in midair\nflew towards Long Riiten. Seeing that\nthe scorching fireball was about to hit\nhim, Long Rit was terrified and quickly\nturned around and ran towards the crowd\nbehind him. However, he was unable to\nshake off the fireball, which flew right\nafter him. As Long Rit was about to lure\nthe fireball into the crowd, everyone\npanicked and scattered in terror. As for\nLong Retin, no matter where he ran, the\nfireball behind him followed. If he ran\ntoo slowly, the fireball would gently\nbrush against his buttocks, burning him\nso badly that he howled and frantically\ndarted and hid among the crowd. A moment\nlater, the fire element in the fireball\nfinally burned out and slowly\ndisappeared into the air. Long Rien was\nso exhausted that he collapsed to the\nground, panting heavily. Fong Yu looked\nat Long Rien lying on the ground and\nasked calmly, \"So, was that joke funny?\nThis isn't fun.\" Long Rien quickly\nturned around and knelt down in front of\nFong Yu, crying out, \"I was wrong, boss.\nPlease forgive me. I'll never do it\nagain. Since you're so sensible,\" Fong\nYu raised an eyebrow and smiled. \"Then\nI'll let you off the hook for now.\" His\npurpose was to establish his authority.\nAfter toying with long retin with\nfireballs, the five clearly defined\ncamps were disrupted by his chaotic\nmovements, and the onlookers looked at\nhim with more awe. After all, the only\none who can summon fireballs is\nundoubtedly a mage. At this stage, there\nare already very few players who can\nchange jobs, let alone a relatively rare\nclass like a mage. It is clear that Fong\nYu&lt;unk&gt;s strength should not be\nunderestimated. At this moment, Fong Yu\nturned to look at the others and asked\ncalmly, \"Who else said they wanted to\nsee my skills? And what about that big\nbrother who said he could take on a\ndragon single-handedly?\" \"Come out and\nhave a go with me.\" Seeing that no one\ndared to answer him, Fongu roughly\nunderstood the situation. It seemed that\nthere were no very strong people in this\ngroup, or that the strong people had not\nyet arrived. Therefore, he had to seize\nthis opportunity to take down these guys\nwho wanted to grab territory in one fell\nswoop. Since no one responded, does that\nmean no one is questioning my abilities?\nHowever, at that moment, a cold arrow\nsuddenly shot out from the crowd, its\narrow head pointing straight at Fong\nYu&lt;unk&gt;s brow. Many people in the crowd\nalso noticed the arrow. Some cried out\nin alarm while others sneered. They all\nthought that Fongu would be killed by\nthe arrow or at the very least injured.\nSuddenly, a shield formed of flames\nappeared in front of Fong Yu,\nsuccessfully blocking the cold arrow. At\nthe same time, Fongu produced another\nfireball and threw it into the crowd.\nThe crowd scattered in terror at the\nsight of the incoming fireball, and the\nmale player who had fired the arrow\ntried to dodge as well, but he was no\nmatch for the speed of the flying\nfireball. A scream rang out as the\nplayer who fired the arrow was struck by\nthe fireball and instantly turned into a\nhuman torch, collapsing to the ground\nwith a groan. \"You all saw it,\" Fong Yu\nsaid, picking up the stray arrow from\nthe ground. He struck first. The players\nfrom the other teams fell silent while\nthe players from Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s support\ngroup began to cheer excitedly. \"Holy\ncrap, as expected of Boss Fong Yu. He's\nreally awesome. I can't believe Fong Yu\nhas become a mage. That fireball spell\nwas so cool. Brother Fong Yu, look at\nme. I want to have your babies. Get out\nof my way. Don't try to take it from me.\nFong Yu, my 36D twin tails can increase\nattack speed. Fongu waved his hand to\nsilence the noise from the support group\nfans. Then turned to look at the players\nfrom the other four groups and asked in\na cold voice, \"Who else?\" Still, no one\ndared to answer. Fong Yu then smiled\ncontemptuously and said, \"So, you're all\ncowards.\" Upon hearing this, someone in\nthe crowd finally couldn't hold back any\nlonger. The bearded man from the Three\nKingdoms heroes gathering jumped out,\npointed at Fong Yu, and shouted, \"You\nscoundrel! You've gone too far,\nbrothers. Come at me. Kill this guy.\"\nWith that, the bearded man charged\ntowards Fong Yu, dragging his\nbroadsword. At that moment, another\nfireball slowly appeared in the air in\nfront of Fong Yu and flew towards the\nbearded man. Holy Seeing that\nthings were going badly, the bearded man\nraised his broadsword and slashed at the\nfireball. However, this guy didn't seem\nto understand the structure of a\nfireball. A simple sword slash was\nnaturally not enough to extinguish the\nfireball. Although the fireball was\nsplit in two by his sword, it still\nburned and crashed into the rot tan\narmor on the man's chest. This bearded\nman was incredibly unlucky. Of all the\nthings he could wear, he had to wear a\nrott tan armor. While rott tan armor\noffers excellent protection against cold\nweapons, it has a fatal weakness. It is\nvulnerable to fire. Unfortunately for\nhim, the person he was trying to kill\nwas a mage who had mastered the art of\nfireballs. In an instant, the rot tan\narmor on the bearded man's body was\nignited by the fireball and began to\nburn fiercely. The bearded man threw\naway his broadsword in terror and tried\nto take off his rottan armor. But how\ncould the rott tan armor that had been\nput on be taken off so easily? In just a\nfew seconds, the bearded man became a\nhuman torch engulfed in flames, howling\nas he collapsed to the ground. Those who\nwere following behind the bearded man,\nready to charge, stopped in their tracks\nafter seeing his fate, staring in horror\nat Fongu not far away. At that moment,\nFong Yu summoned a third fireball and\nasked all the players present, \"Who\nelse?\" The chaotic crowd fell silent\nonce again. Apart from the genuine fans\nof Fong Yu and Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s support\ngroup who were excited, the players from\nthe other groups looked at Fong Yu with\nextreme fear, afraid that they would be\nhis next target. Although they knew Fong\nYu was alone and that they still had a\nchance to kill him if they all worked\ntogether, no one dared to lead the group\nanymore because the leader was now a\ncharred corpse. Seeing that no one in\nthe crowd dared to provoke him anymore,\nFong Yu waved his hand, dispersing the\nfireball in midair and said in a\nslightly more consiliatory tone,\n\"Actually, I hate fighting and killing\nthe most. I prefer the saying, win\npeople over with virtue.\" No one in the\nroom dared to respond to Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s\nwords. Fong Yu then said, \"Since neither\nof us wants to fight anymore, can we sit\ndown and talk calmly about how to divide\nthis site?\" These words immediately\nsparked whispers among the crowd. At\nthis moment, Fattyong stepped forward\nand said, \"Yes, yes, Fong Yu is right.\nWe're&lt;unk&gt; all from the same server, so\nwe should unite. We'll have to fight\nagainst players from other servers\ntogether in the future. Let's sit down\nand talk things over and seek common\nground while reserving differences.\nDon't you all agree? Chapter 106\ndiscussion with Fong Yu and Song Jaming\nplaying the good cop and the bad cop\nrespectively. The players from all five\nteams eventually overcame their\ndifferences and sat down in the open\nspace outside the Yorktown ruins to form\na discussion where each team and even\neach participating player could speak.\nFong Yu naturally hosted the discussion.\nAfter everyone was seated, he stood up\nand said, \"I won't waste any more words.\nThis site is quite large, a small to\nmedium-sized town. Although 90% of the\nbuildings have been destroyed, there are\nstill nearly 300 habitable houses in the\nremaining 10%. If all the houses in the\nsite can be restored, it should be able\nto accommodate 3,000 to 4,000 people.\nSo, there's no need for anyone to argue.\nBut there are over 6,000 players in our\narea,\" someone in the crowd shouted.\nFunu glanced at the man and replied.\n\"Then we'll squeeze in for now. Two\npeople in one house isn't impossible. As\nlong as we slowly accumulate resources\nand upgrade our houses, we can build\ntwo-bedroom, 3-bedroom, or even two or\nthree-story buildings. Are you still\nworried about not having enough room? So\nmany of us are staying here, and we all\nbelong to different teams. What if\nthere's a conflict? A female player\nraised her hand and said, \"Especially us\nwomen. We are a vulnerable group in this\nsurvival game and are easily harassed\nand assaulted by male players.\" Upon\nhearing this, many female gamers in the\ncrowd nodded in agreement. Fongu nodded\nand replied, \"You've hit the nail on the\nhead. To put it bluntly, once we enter\nthis game, we lose the supervisory and\nmanagement departments that were once\npart of the social system. Without the\nconstraints of laws and police and\nwithout government management and\noperation, it's easy for conflicts and\ndisputes to arise as well as the\nharassment or infringement you just\nmentioned. Therefore, the most urgent\ntask is to formulate a set of\nsupervision and management regulations\nand to select some players as town\nmanagers in order to minimize and\nprevent the occurrence of the things you\nmentioned. The woman then asked, \"How\nshould the supervision and management\nregulations be formulated? How should\nthe managers be selected?\" Fongu thought\nfor a moment and replied, \"If we follow\nthe systems instructions, the lord\nshould be responsible for formulating\nand selecting management personnel.\nHowever, we do not have a lord yet. So\nmy idea is that the supervision and\nmanagement regulations should be\ncompiled by everyone through\nbrainstorming. If any players are\nfamiliar with the legal provisions, I\nhope they can offer more suggestions.\nUpon hearing this, a man in the crowd\nstood up and said, \"Me, me. My name is\nJeangi. I'm a lawyer. I'm quite familiar\nwith legal provisions.\" Funu looked at\nthe lawyer named Jeang Wei, nodded, and\nsaid, \"Very good. Thank you for your\ncooperation.\" Several more players then\nraised their hands, saying they used to\nbe police officers or worked in\ngovernment departments. and some even\nsaid they used to be security guards and\nhad some management experience. Fongu\nwaved his hand and said, \"As for the\nselection of management personnel, to\nensure fairness, everyone can list their\nstrengths and then run from management\npositions in their respective areas of\nexpertise. As for the specific\narrangements, you can discuss them\nyourselves later. In short, the core\nprinciple is discuss any problems and do\nnot resort to violence lightly. Then who\nmakes the final decision? Someone asked.\nFong Yu pointed to Song Jimming sitting\nto the side and said he will make the\nfinal decision on all related matters.\nIf you think there is a problem with his\ndecision, you can talk to me again. What\nabout us leaders who were originally in\nthe team? A player in the Three Kingdoms\nHeroes Tournament asked. Fong Yu raised\nan eyebrow and said, \"Since everyone is\nchosen to live in the same city, we\nshould be a unified hole. All those\nscattered groups should be disbanded and\nmerged with Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s support group\nto form a new hole. These words\nimmediately caused an uproar among the\ncrowd with many people starting to\nobject. It's not hard to guess that\nthose who objected were players who were\nin management or leadership positions in\ntheir original teams. Quiet, Fong Yu\nshouted coldly, silencing all whispers.\nHe glanced at the crowd and said coldly,\n\"Don't forget I conquered this city.\nOriginally, I only intended for the\nsupport group members to live here. As\nfor the other members of your teams, I\ndon't care what your previous positions\nwere in your respective teams, but if\nyou want to live in this city, you have\nto give up your original teams and\nidentities. If you're unwilling, Fong Yu\npointed into the distance and said, \"The\noutside world is vast. Anyone who\ndoesn't want to give up their team and\nstatus can leave on their own. I won't\nstop them.\" These words sparked another\nround of heated discussion among the\ncrowd. One male player even stood up and\npointed at Fong Yu saying, \"This is\nblatant authoritarianism.\"\nFong Yu looked at the player and smiled\nslightly, saying, \"Which I of yours saw\nme as a dictator? All the managers are\nelected by yourselves, and we discuss\nproblems together. I only step in to\nmake decisions when there are problems\nthat you can't solve through discussion.\nIs that what you call dictatorship?\"\nThen Fong Yu thought for a moment and\nsaid, \"The bottom line I can accept is\nthat the leaders of each team can form a\ncouncil with Song Jimming as the council\nchairman and having veto power. You can\ndecide the rest.\" Having said that,\nFongu was too lazy to waste any more\nwords with these people. And finally\nsaid, \"You should all know that I have\nnever wanted to be a lord because I am\nvery clear that I do not have the\nexperience and ability to be a lord. My\nopinion is still the same now. At\npresent, I have decided to recommend\nSong Juming for the position of Lord.\nBut there are still four days before the\nend of the year. If someone can\ndemonstrate outstanding management\nability in these four days, I may change\nmy mind. So, if any of you want to be\nthat lord, you have to show me your\nability in the next 4 days. However, the\nplayer persisted and asked again, \"What\nmakes you think you can arrange the\nlord's position?\" \"Why?\" Fong Yu raised\nan eyebrow slightly and said, \"Because I\nhave 300,000 worth of supplies in hand\nand more than 1,500 supporters.\" The two\nconditions for becoming a lord mentioned\nby the system are that I am the player\nwith the most supplies in the entire\nregion and the player with the highest\nvote support rate. Do you think there is\nanyone who can surpass me in these two\naspects? These words caused an uproar in\nthe audience. Supplies worth 300,000 for\nthe players present. This is nothing\nshort of an astronomical figure. It\nshould be noted that even Sidu Hanan,\nwho died earlier, only managed to\naccumulate about 30,000 units of\nsupplies after exploiting all members of\nthe Dong Sean gang, while Fongu alone\nhad 300,000 units of supplies. Only then\ndid the players present realized just\nhow vast the gap was between themselves\nand Fong Yu. At this moment, Fong Yu\nsaid again, \"If you think this civilized\nway is not acceptable, then we can also\nresolve this by force.\" After saying\nthat, he snapped his fingers and held up\ntwo fireballs with both hands. At the\nsame time, a huge green lion shadow\nappeared above Olivia's head as she\nstood behind Fong Yu, roaring to the\nsky. Alpha standing to the side also\nturned completely crimson and then swept\nhis cold and cruel gaze across everyone\npresent. The room fell silent once\nagain. All right, I've said everything I\nneeded to say. Fong Yu smiled slightly\nand said, \"The meeting will now be\nchaired by Song Jimming. I have other\nmatters to attend to, so I won't stay\nany longer. The leaders of your other\nfour teams can add me as a friend. If\nthere are any issues that cannot be\nresolved during the meeting, you can\nmessage me privately. After saying this,\nFong Yu nodded slightly to everyone and\nthen left. Only after Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s\nfigure disappeared into the woods did\nthe players in the square breathe a sigh\nof relief. Wow, Fong Yu is amazing. He's\nalready a mage. Exactly. That fireball\nwas terrifying. It could even curve. And\nthat mummy lady behind him is so cool.\nThat huge green lion shadow is\nabsolutely awesome. Huh? How did you\nknow that mommy was a young lady? Are\nyou blind? Even though she's wearing\nlinen clothes, her bus size is just too\noutrageous. Can't you even see that?\nDamn, I didn't even notice. I was so\nbusy looking at that red-haired dog. I\nreally want to have one, too. Chapter 1\n07. Heading to the spider cave.\nActually, the reason Fong Yu left early\nwasn't because he had anything to do,\nbut because he really didn't know what\nto say. His remarks at the meeting were\nalready the most general management\napproach he could come up with, even\nafter racking his brains. If he were\nasked to elaborate further, he'd\nprobably be stumped because he simply\nwouldn't know what to say. After all, he\nwas just a novelist, not a politician,\nand had no practical management\nexperience. So he had to make a quick\ngetaway after putting on a show.\nOtherwise, the aloof and doineering\npersona he had painstakingly built up\nwould crumble. This is also why he\ndoesn't want to become a lord because he\nreally has no management experience. His\ntrue role is actually to exert a\ndeterrent effect because he has high-end\ncombat power that other players do not\nhave. As soon as he appeared, he took\ndown those who wanted to instigate\nconflict and extinguished the fuse of\nconflict, which made this discussion go\nsmoothly. Without his ruthless methods,\ntoday's player gathering at the Yorktown\nruins could very well have turned into a\nlarge-scale armed conflict. And if that\nhad happened, it wouldn't have been as\nsimple as just one person dying. After\nFong Yu left, he secretly hid nearby to\nobserve, ready to step in and suppress\nany unexpected situations or disputes\nthat might arise during the discussion.\nHowever, the actual situation was much\nbetter than Fongu had expected. He\nwaited for more than an hour without any\nunexpected events at the discussion, and\nas time went on, the number of\nparticipants increased, quickly reaching\nnearly a thousand people. After\ncommunicating with Song Jiming via\nprivate chat and confirming that the\ndiscussion was going smoothly, Fong Yu\ndecided not to waste any more time\nthere. After telling Song Jimming to\ncontact him anytime if he had any\nquestions, he left with Alpha and Ryan.\nHe planned to go to the spider forest\neast of the manor to find the spider\ncave that the game assistant Xiaolu had\ntold him about and see if he could\nobtain the skeleton of the giant spider\nwith magic patterns inside. Yorktown is\nlocated northeast of the haunted house\nmanor. So Fongu only needs to cross the\nriver next to the ruins and head south\nto enter the spider forest. The way to\ncross the river is still the same as\nbefore. Olivia carries Fong Yu and jumps\nacross the river. As for Alpha, it's\nstill just swimming across the river. To\nbe honest, it feels amazing to be held\nby a woman, especially when she's being\ncarried in a princess carry. when he was\ncarried for the first time in the\nmorning, Fongu was preoccupied with how\nto deal with the Yorktown ruins, so he\ndidn't really pay attention to the\nexperience. But when he was carried\nacross the river the second time, Fongu\nreally got to experience it properly.\nAside from a touch of shy embarrassment,\nit was mostly a kind of enjoyment.\nAlthough Olivia's body was bound by\nbandages, the unique elasticity of a\nwoman's body still made Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s\nheart flutter, especially because of the\njumping and the princess carry position.\nOlivia's chest rubbed against Fong Yu\nseveral times. That feeling tsk\nindescribable. After crossing the river,\nFong Yu and Olivia, led by Alpha,\nplunged into the spider forest. The\nforest was called the spider forest\nbecause there were so many spiders in\nit. Just a few dozen meters in, a large\nnumber of spiderw webs appeared in the\nforest along with countless black\nspiders of all sizes. But Fong Yu is no\nlonger the same Fong Yu who first\nentered the game. He doesn't even need\nthe intimidation of torches, his butcher\nclass's passive skill, killing aura.\nAlone is enough to keep the spiders at\nbay. So Fu collected the spiderw webs in\nthe woods as he walked deeper into the\nspider forest while Alpha and Olivia\nstayed by his side the whole time,\nkeeping a close eye on their every move.\nAfter all, Fongu was ambushed and bitten\nby that human-faced demon spider in the\nspider forest last time and almost died\nfrom poisoning, so the two companions\nwere extra cautious this time. Half an\nhour later, Fongu had collected 102\nspiderw webs. Guided by Alpha, he\narrived at the center of the spider\nforest where he saw five giant spider\nnests rising from the ground. The\ncentral one was an astonishing 10 m\ntall, its top piercing through the tall\ntree canopy. Once they arrived here,\nalthough Fong used passive skill,\nkilling aura, was effective against the\nspiders, the spiders no longer hid or\nretreated. Instead, they stood at the\nedge of their spider nest and let out a\nseries of threatening low growls at\nFongu. At this time, some brightly\ncolored yellowish brown spiders began to\ncrawl out of the spider nest. These\nspiders were significantly larger than\nthe black spiders outside, with the\nlargest even exceeding 2 m in length.\nUpon seeing Fong Yu and his companions,\nthe brownish yellow spiders nimly\ncharged towards Fong Yu with their\nhooked legs. These spiders are actually\nimmune to the fear effect of the\nmurderous aura. However, these giant\ntawny spiders were quickly stopped by\nOlivia and Alpha. Alpha in his\nred-haired form had no trouble dealing\nwith the spiders. He was extremely fast,\nturning into a red phantom as he darted\naround in the spider swarm. And the\nspiders couldn't do anything about him.\nAs for Olivia, needless to say, with her\ngreatly increased strength, she can deal\nwith these giant spiders with just one\nax stroke each without any hesitation.\nSoon, more than a dozen giant yellowish\nbrown spiders died at the hands of Alpha\nand Olivia, while Fong Yu, standing\nbehind them, summoned three fireballs\nthat hovered in midair and then took out\na bomb from his backpack. He's become a\nbit addicted to using explosives. As\nlong as he has them in hand, he feels\ncompletely secure. After all, all fear\nstems from insufficient firepower. When\nyou have enough firepower, there is\nnothing to fear. Immediately, Fongu\nprepared to clear the area. He started\nby lighting the fuse of the explosive\ncharge in his hand with a fireball and\nthen threw it at the swarm of spiders\nsurrounding the spider nest. One pack,\ntwo packs. After five explosive charges\nwere thrown, a series of explosions\nbegan. Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.\nAfter a series of violent tremors and\nshock waves, a burst of intense flames\nengulfed the nearest spider nest. No\nspiders remained at the epicenter of the\nexplosion, and those further away had\nbeen terrified by the force of the blast\nand fled into the depths of the forest.\nSoon, the fire on the nearest spider\nnest began to grow larger and larger,\nand a towering tree nearby began to\ntremble slightly. Upon seeing this, Fong\nYu and his two companions immediately\nretreated, knowing that the forest\nguardians had been alerted once again.\nSure enough, in no time, a huge canopy\nof trees fell from the sky and slammed\ndown on the burning spider nest. Chapter\n108. The wrath of the forest spirit.\nWhen Fong Yu saw the giant tree begin to\ntremble, he knew that the tree people\nwere about to appear. In fact, this was\nalso part of his plan. He would use the\nshock and flames caused by the explosion\nto kill the spider swarm while drawing\nout the tree people to attack the spider\nnest. After all, the effect of the\ntrench slap was even better than his own\nexplosives. Sure enough, the giant tree\nshook more and more violently, and soon\na giant hand formed from the tree\ncanopy, descended from the sky, and\nslammed onto the burning spider nest.\nBang! With a violent tremor, the\ntowering spider nest was flattened into\na heap by the giant hand. And amidst the\nbillowing smoke, the flames on the\nspider nest slowly died down. After the\nflames were completely extinguished by\nthe Trent's giant palm, the trant\nwithdrew its hand. But this time, to\nFong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s surprise, the trant did\nnot turn back into a giant tree.\nInstead, it twisted its thick trunk,\nturned to look at Fong Yu, and then\nraised its giant palm again. slapping it\ntowards Fong Yu. Holy crap. Fong Yu\nrealized something was wrong and quickly\nretreated, getting out of the giant\npalms attack range before it landed. Why\nwould a treeman attack itself? Did it\ndiscover that it caused the explosion?\nTreeman probably don't have that much\nintelligence, but then he saw the three\nfireballs floating above his head and\ninstantly understood what was going on.\nSo, he quickly extinguished the\nfireballs in midair, trying to eliminate\nthe tree spirits hostility towards him.\nTo Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s surprise, after seeing\nthe tree spirit attack Fong Yu, Olivia\nimmediately rushed towards the tree\nspirit and swung her iron axe at the\ntree spirit's trunk. Thump! The iron axe\nslammed into the tree trunk, immediately\ncutting a deep gash in it. The treeman\nseemed to feel the pain as well and\nwithdrew its giant hand that had struck\nFongu. Instead, it swung at Olivia\nbeneath it. However, Olivia, who had\nregained her physical body, reacted\nextremely quickly. After pulling out the\nax from the tree trunk, she dodged and\nrolled to the other half of the tree\nman's torso and then chopped down on the\ntree trunk again. Seeing that Olivia had\nalready started fighting the tree\nspirit. Fongu naturally wouldn't just\nstand by and watch. While having Alpha\nprotect him from any spider attacks, he\nsummoned another fireball and hurled it\nat the tree spirit. Fong Yu aimed at the\nspot where the treeman's giant hand\nconnected to the tree trunk, attempting\nto burn off the giant hand. Although the\nfireball successfully hit that spot and\nstarted burning, it would still take\ntime to burn it off completely.\nFortunately, Olivia was incredibly\nagile. No matter how the tree man\nslapped her, she could nimly dodge and\nthen use her iron ax to leave wounds on\nthe tree man's torso. Before long, the\ngiant hand that the treeman used to\nstrike was burned off by Fong Yu's\nfireball and fell down, while Olivia's\niron axe kept chopping the crack in the\ntree man's trunk wider and wider.\nFinally, the broken trunk could no\nlonger bear the weight of the tree man\nand broke in half, crashing to the\nground. Fongu waited for a moment, and\nafter confirming that the fallen tree\nspirit was no longer moving, he walked\nup to it. The dead tree ant can be\ndecomposed. Break down. Gained 20 wood,\none life core. Wood of life core. The\ncore of a living tree. The perfect\nchoice for crafting wands. Well done. I\nhappen to be missing a wand, and I\nshould be able to make my own when I get\nback. After finishing cleaning up the\ntree spirits remains, Fongu smiled at\nOlivia and said, \"Thank you for your\nhard work. Protecting you is my duty,\"\nOlivia replied. Immediately, Fong Yu\nbegan to examine the remaining four\nspider nests. At this moment, the\nspiders that had been scared away by the\nexplosion, and the trance reappeared in\nFong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s field of vision. It seemed\nthat they did not want to give up their\nnests. So, Fong Yu gritted his teeth,\nsummoned another fireball, and shot it\nat one of the spider nests. He planned\nto burn down all the spider nests here\nto force the spiders to leave. As for\nwhether it will lead to the emergence of\nnew tree people, wouldn't that be even\nbetter? That way, you can obtain even\nmore life with course. However, when\nFongu tried to summon a second fireball,\nhe found himself experiencing dizziness.\nThis means that the magic points have\nbeen used up and the spirit points are\nbeing overdrawn. So Fong you could only\ntake out a torch from his backpack, rush\nto the burning spider nest under the\nprotection of Olivia and Alpha, light\nthe torch, and throw it at the other\nthree spider nests. I'll set your camp\nablaze. As three streaks of fire shot\ninto the sky, Fongu suddenly noticed\nthat the entire forest began to sway and\neven the ground began to tremble. What's\ngoing on? Fongu was secretly alarmed.\nDue to your continuous arson and the\nkilling of a tray ant, the spirit of the\nforest is enraged. It is recommended\nthat you leave the forest immediately or\nfind a place to hide or your life will\nbe in danger. Seeing the game assistance\nnotification, Fongu sensed something was\nwrong. His actions seemed to have\nangered the forest. He immediately\nlooked around at the trees and sure\nenough found that their swaying was\nbecoming increasingly rapid, soon\nturning into shaking. Exactly the same\nsymptom as before the tree man appeared.\nIf the entire forest turned into tree\npeople, wouldn't I just die on the spot?\nEven Olivia couldn't stop it. So, we\nneed to find a place to hide right away.\nFongu remembered that he came here to\nfind the spider cave. And Alpha brought\nhim here in the end, which means that\nthe spider cave is nearby. If we hide in\nthe spider cave, we should be able to\nescape the Trent's furious revenge.\nAlpha, where is that spider cave? Fong\nYu asked the dog anxiously. Upon hearing\nthis, Alpha immediately darted towards\nthe largest burning spider nest and\nturned to call out to Fong Yu. Woof\nwoof. Olivia, who was standing nearby,\ntranslated, \"It's in that spider's\nnest.\" Upon hearing this, Fong Yu\nimmediately said, \"Hurry, let's go.\" He\nthen ran towards the spider's nest. When\nhe reached the largest spider nest,\nwhich was as tall as four or five\nstories, the surrounding trees had\nalready completed their transformation\ninto tree beings. The nearest tree being\nhad turned around and swung its huge\ntree hand down on the spider nest where\nFongu was. Charge in. After saying that,\nFong Yu gritted his teeth and led the\nway into the entrance of the spider's\nnest with Alpha and Olivia following\nclosely behind. Once inside, Fong Yu\ndiscovered by the light of his torch\nthat it was actually a rock cave, not\nthe cave he had imagined that was\nentirely made of spiderw webs. The two\npeople and the dog had barely run a few\nsteps into the spider's nest when a loud\nbang came from outside, followed by the\nentire rocky cave shaking and rock\nfragments falling down. No, there's\nstill a risk of collapse. We have to go\nfurther in. Without Fong Yu giving any\norders, Alpha had already charged ahead\ninto the depths of the cave. While\nOlivia swung her iron ax to shield Fong\nYu from falling rocks, the group\nhurriedly rushed into the heart of the\ncave. The path inside the cave was\nsloping downwards. Fongu sprinted down\nthe path, encountering some spiders\nalong the way that were also fleeing\ndeeper into the cave. However, he didn't\nneed to lift a finger. Alpha and Olivia\nhad already taken care of them. After\nrunning for nearly a hundred meters, the\nslope slowed down, and the originally\nnarrow passage turned into a spacious\nunderground cave. Fongu raised his torch\nand carefully examined the cave. He\nfound that the rock walls and the ground\nwere almost entirely covered with dense\nspider webs, and among those webs were\noval cocoons the size of basketballs. If\nhe wasn't mistaken, they were all spider\neggs. The sheer number of them made Fong\nuse scalp tingle. Chapter 109. in the\nremains of the demon patterned giant\nspider. Because the torches provided\nlimited light, the more distant areas\nremained in darkness. Soon, a series of\nrustling sounds came from the darkness.\nAnd before long, Fong Yu saw many large\nblack spiders the size of millstones, as\nwell as giant yellowish brown spiders\ntaller than Fong Yu emerge from the\ndarkness and crawl towards him. Alpha\nand Olivia stood in front of Fong Yu\nwith their escape route blocked and no\nway to retreat. This is destined to be a\nfierce battle. Fongu gritted his teeth\nand while Alpha, Olivia, and the spiders\nwere fighting, took out dozens of pieces\nof wood from his backpack and piled them\non the ground to form a huge campfire.\nThen, by consuming his mental energy, he\nforcibly conjured a fireball to ignite\nthe campfire. As the huge bonfire roared\nto life, the spiders around them finally\nsuccumbed to the intense flames and\nslowly retreated. In less than a minute,\nno fewer than a hundred spider corpses\nhad piled up at Alpha and Olivia's feet.\nFong Yu shook his throbbing head, took\nout a magic crystal from his backpack,\nand began absorbing its magic power\nwhile using the light from the giant\nbonfire to survey his surroundings. The\ncave was much larger than he had\nimagined, about half the size of a\nfootball field. It was filled with\ncountless spider eggs and spiders. When\nFong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s gaze swept to the center\nof the cave, he gasped and the hairs on\nhis body stood on end because he saw a\ngigantic blue gray spider as tall as a\nthree or fourstory building and much\nlarger than his own wooden house\ncrawling in the center of the cave.\n\"Fuck you.\" Fongu took a step back and\nsubconsciously pulled out a bomb from\nhis backpack, ready to detonate it and\nthrow it at the giant spider if things\nwent wrong. But after a careful\nexamination, he discovered that the\ngiant spider seemed to have remained\ncompletely still from head to tail, and\nits body was covered with crimson gold\nmagic patterns. Could it be the remains\nof the giant spider with demonic\npatterns in the spider cave that Xiaolu\nmentioned? So Fongu leaned closer to\nOlivia and asked, \"Is that huge spider\nin the center of the cave alive or\ndead?\" Olivia glanced at the giant\nspider and replied, \"It has no life\nforce and has been dead for a long time.\nReally, that's what I'm here for.\" But\nthen Olivia raised her finger and\npointed to the top of the center of the\ncave, saying, \"There is a powerful life\nforce there.\" Fu looked up in the\ndirection Olivia was pointing and was\nstartled. On the rock at the top of the\ncave was a huge round cocoon. Unlike the\nwhite cocoons on the ground, this one\nwasn't made of spider silk. It was a\nmass of flesh that was constantly\nswelling and contracting. Something\nseemed to be growing inside. Fongu\nraised an eyebrow slightly and asked\nOlivia, \"Can you tell what's in there?\"\nOlivia shook her head and said, \"I don't\nknow, but besides the strong life\nfluctuations, I also sensed a powerful\ndark force. I suggest we don't provoke\nthat thing. I'm not sure I can defeat\nwhat's inside. Fun nodded. Since Olivia\nsaid she might not be able to beat it,\nthe thing inside must be very powerful.\nSo, he would listen to Olivia and not\nprovoke it. Anyway, I came here for the\nspider. As long as I get that thing,\neverything will be fine. So Fong Yu\ncontinued to take out wood from his\nbackpack and spread it towards the giant\nspider remains in the center of the\ncave, setting it on fire as he went.\nWith the help of his butcher passive\nskill, killing intent, he finally\nmanaged to squeeze a path through the\nspider swarm to the giant spider\nremains. Upon arriving at the remains of\nthe giant spider, Fong Yu was once again\ndeeply shocked. The biggest monster I\nsaw last time was the Titan cat in the\ndungeon. But that Titan cat was only\nfive or 6 m long and less than 2 m tall.\nThe remains of the giant spider with the\ndemonic pattern in front of us are over\n6 m tall and its hooked legs spread out\non both sides for more than 10 m.\nTerrifying. The remains of the demon\nslaying giant spider. A war behemoth\nfrom the demon realm surviving the war\nbetween gods and demons a thousand years\nago. Its body is covered in innate\nmagical runes, allowing it to cast\nvarious powerful dark magic spells.\nUnfortunately, it is now dead. The\nremains can be used to craft highle\nequipment, which provides additional\nbonuses to dark magic. Alternatively,\nthe remains can be used as a base to\nbuild a monster hut to raise pets with a\nchance to awaken dark magic talent in\nyour pets. After reading the\nintroduction to the game assistant, Funu\nunderstood. No wonder this giant spider\nwith demonic patterns is so huge. Even\nthough it has been dead for countless\nyears, its remains are still lifelike\nand incredibly intimidating. It turns\nout it was a war beast of the demon\nrace. In comparison, even the Titan cat,\na pet of the titans, is no match for it.\nNo wonder there's such a huge spider\nnest here. It turns out there's such a\npowerful ancestor here. Fongu glanced at\nthe swarm of spiders around him, which\nwere emitting low growls and smiled\nslightly, saying, \"Sorry, I'll have to\nborrow your ancestor for a bit.\" After\nsaying that, Fong Yu chose to collect\nthe remains of the demonpatterned giant\nspider. The next second, the giant\ndemonic spider disappeared regretfully\ninto the cave. Fong Yu opened his\nbackpack and found that this thing\nactually took up nine inventory slots.\nAt this moment, the surrounding spiders\nbecame furious when they saw that their\nancestor was gone. Some of the giant\nyellowish brown spiders even tried to\nrush over and attack Fong Yu despite the\nflames. But Olivia used her iron ax to\nchop off their hook legs one by one,\ncausing them to collapse to the ground.\nTaking advantage of this moment, Fong Yu\nturned around and ran back to the\nacupoint he had come from. under the\ncover of the fire light and Olivia. Fong\nYu and Alpha quickly ran back into the\nacupoint. After Olivia, who was fighting\nand retreating, also arrived at the\nacupoint, Fong Yu took out dozens of\npieces of broken stone from his backpack\nand completely sealed the acupoint. Only\nthen did Fong Yu breathe a sigh of\nrelief, realizing that he had finally\nachieved his goal. The remaining\nquestion is whether those treemen\noutside are still there. So Fong Yu led\nAlpha and Olivia up the tunnel, but when\nthey were almost at the spider's nest on\nthe ground, they found that the exit had\nbeen buried by rubble. It was estimated\nthat the tree people had collapsed the\ncave in order to put out the fire.\nBecause he wasn't sure if the treemen\noutside were still there, Fongu didn't\ndare use explosives to detonate the\nexplosives, fearing it would attract\ntheir attention. With no other option,\nhe took out two pickaxes from his\nbackpack, one for himself and one for\nOlivia, and began digging. Half an hour\nlater, thanks to the efforts of the two,\nthe collapsed area was finally cleared.\nOlivia went out first to take a look,\nand after confirming that the\nsurrounding trees had been restored, she\nnotified Fong Yu and Alpha in the cave\nto come out. Immediately afterwards, the\ntwo people and the dog hurriedly headed\nback towards the manor. Chapter 11, 10.\nseeds of the magic touch vine. Shortly\nafter, Fong Yu and his group left, two\nsharp blue glowing claws suddenly\nemerged from the hanging cocoon at the\ntop of the underground cave. These claws\nslowly tore open the outer wall of the\ncocoon, and a large amount of viscous\nliquid gushed out from the cracks. Then,\na huge spider 3 to 4 m tall crawled out\nof the cocoon. This spider is entirely\nblue with many dark gold magic patterns\nwrapped around its body. especially on\nits huge abdomen where there is a\nlifelike human face. If Fongu were here,\nhe would definitely recognize it at a\nglance. This is the same human-faced\ndemon spider that had a grudge against\nhim before. It's just that its size has\nincreased several times. Its color has\nchanged from black to dark blue, and it\nhas some dark gold demonic patterns on\nits body. After the human-faced spider\ncrawled out of its cocoon, it shot out a\nsilk thread from its tail at the top of\nthe cave. It slowly descended to the\nground along the silk thread, but then\nit froze. The remains of the giant\nspider with demonic patterns in the\ncenter of the cave have disappeared. A\nthief actually took advantage of the gap\nin its evolution to steal the remains of\nits ancestor. The human-faced spider was\nfurious. It roared and unleashed a\nshadow blast that swept towards the\ntrembling spiders around it. In an\ninstant, the spiders were sent flying by\nthe shadow blast, crashing into the\nsurrounding rock walls and turning into\na pile of minced meat. This is the\nhuman-faced spider's punishment for\nthose who failed to protect the remains\nof their ancestor. Immediately, the\nhuman-faced spider began searching the\ncave, searching for traces left by the\nthief, then following those traces to\nfind the thief, draining its brains, and\nthen tearing it to pieces. Soon, the\nhuman-faced spider arrived at the\nentrance to the cave leading to the\nground, where it smelled a familiar\nscent. It smells like that human who\nburned down his own nest last time, and\nthe smell of that wretched, vicious dog.\nThere's also an unknown flavor. The six\nblack eyes of the human-faced spider\nbegan to glow red. It was that damned\nhuman and his lackey. With both old and\nnew grudges combined, the human-faced\nspider felt it could no longer control\nthe violent intent within it. Last time,\nit led its people to storm the haunted\nhouse and kill that human to avenge\nitself. But it was utterly defeated by\nthe skeleton, a female ghost, and a dog\ninside the haunted house. This was\nundoubtedly a great humiliation for it.\nTherefore, it had no choice but to\nreturn to the cave where its ancestor\nlived and observed the magic patterns on\nthe ancestors remains for a long time.\nAfter comprehending the mysteries of the\nmagic patterns, it was able to evolve\ninto its current form. All of this was\nfor the purpose of seeking revenge\nagainst that human. Now, before he could\neven seek revenge on that guy, he\nunexpectedly came to his own base and\nstole his ancestors remains. This is\nintolerable. That damned human must be\nkilled. Then the human-faced spider\nroared and summoned the spiders deep\nwithin its nest, preparing to once again\nmassacre the human's house. Fong Yu,\nupon returning to the manor, was unaware\nof the dangers that lay ahead. Although\nhe had wondered why he hadn't\nencountered the human-faced spider that\nhad attacked him before, he ultimately\ndidn't take it to heart. In his view,\nthe human-faced spider was something he\ncould easily handle, even without Alfa\nand Olivia. It was already noon when\nthey returned to the manor. Funu began\nto consider what to eat for lunch. There\nwere more and more foodies in the house\nnow, himself, the dog, the book of the\nevil god of food, and Olivia Lane, who\nhad regained her physical body. There\nwere a total of four mouths waiting to\nbe fed. Oh, right. There's also a little\nspider named Cherry Blossom. Tsk tsk I\nfeel like I'm almost becoming a\nstay-at-home dad. Despite his\ncomplaints, Fong Yu still went into the\nkitchen, intending to open the strange\nrefrigerator he had just obtained from\nthe Book of Evil Gods yesterday, and see\nwhat ingredients were inside. The upper\ncompartment of this refrigerator is\nquite amazing. Identical items placed\ninside will only occupy one space,\nsimilar to the storage space in a\nbackpack. Fong Yu eventually took out a\nfew potatoes and green peppers,\nintending to make some stir-fried\npotatoes and green peppers. He also took\nout a few pieces of wild boar meat,\nplanning to simply make some pan fried\npork chops. After all, he was in a hurry\nto finish lunch and upgrade his manner.\nHe still remembered what the system\nsaid. His manor had chosen the\ntechnology tree direction and would be\nupgraded to ghost manner. He was eager\nto see what the newly added monster hut,\nundead graveyard, and undead basement\nwould do. By the time Fongu had finished\npreparing lunch, Olivia had already\nremoved the bandages from her head and\nwas sitting at the dining table, her\nlong golden waves draped over her\nshoulders, exuding charm. Alfa also sat\nin the chair opposite, drooling and\nsticking out his tongue. Even the little\nspider cherry blossom, which was perched\non the chandelier, followed its web to\nthe dining table, waiting for Fong Yu's\ndelicious food. \"Sorry to keep you\nwaiting,\" Fong Yu said as he placed the\ndishes on the table one by one. \"Lunch\nwill be simple. Please don't mind.\"\nOlivia smiled slightly and picked up her\nchopsticks like Fong Yu, trying to pick\nup the meat patties on the plate.\nHowever, her technique was still clumsy,\nand it was difficult for her to pick\nthem up. At this moment, Fong Yu walked\nto the workbench, took out three sets of\nsilver knives and forks, and handed one\nset to Olivia. I guess you'd prefer to\nuse this one. Olivia paused slightly\nwhen she saw the knife and fork Fongu\noffered her, then gave him a warm smile,\ntook the knife and fork, and said to\nFong Yu, \"Thank you, master.\" Undead\nknight Olivia Lane's trust level plus\n10. Current trust level 258.\nSeeing the game assistance notification,\nFong Yu raised an eyebrow. He hadn't\nexpected that this unintentional act\nwould actually increase his\nfavorability. Not bad. But then he\nnoticed a detail. Olivia, are you a\nknight? Funu asked tentatively. Upon\nhearing this, Olivia nodded slightly and\nsaid, I was once a member of the\nImperial Knights. An empire? Funu asked\ncuriously. Are there any human empires\naround here? I thought most of the\nhumans in this world had died out.\nOlivia smiled slightly and said, \"It's\nnot what you think. The place we are in\nis a huge island called Divine\nPunishment Island. There are very few\nintelligent races on the island, but\nthere is a continent to the north of\nDivine Punishment Island where there are\nmany intelligent races and countries.\"\n\"I see.\" Funu raised an eyebrow\nslightly. This information was very\nimportant to him. It seems that this\ndivine punishment island should be\nconsidered their starting village, while\nthat continent will be the new map they\nwill explore later. He even remembered\nwhat the game assistant had told him\nbefore that there seemed to be an\neastern continent with an extremely high\ndanger level. Tsk tsk. After lunch,\nFunyu tidied up the table, took out the\nbook of evil gods, and fed the guy the\nseveral pieces of fried pork chops that\nhe had prepared beforehand. To be\nhonest, this guy has the biggest\nappetite in the whole house. He was fed\nfive large pieces of meat, which is\nequivalent to the food rations of\neveryone in the house. Soon after it\nburped, it spat out a small,\nunremarkable grayish brown ball. What\ncould it be? Fongu picked up the small\nball. Demonic tentacle vine seed, yellow\npremium. Originally a demonic blood vine\nfrom the demon realm, it was later\ncorrupted by the energy of an evil god\nand mutated into a demonic tentacle\nvine. It is an excellent defensive\nplant. Simply drip blood to bind it to\nits owner and then plant it within the\narea of your house. Each time the\ndemonic tentacle vine devours a corpse,\nit will grow a new tentacle vine. The\nsize of the new vine is related to the\nsize and grade of the corpse it\ndevoured. Chapter 111. cultivating the\nmagic tentacle vine, monsters attack.\nLooking at the small round ball in his\nhand, about the size of a chocolate\nball, Fong Yu's lips curled into a\nslight smile. After interacting with\nmany other players in the past 2 days,\nhe had actually been worried about the\nmanor's defenses. If other players\nmanage to sneak into your manor while\nyou're out with Alpha and Olivia during\nthe day, it's quite dangerous. After\nall, Valentina can't be in the sun\nduring the day. Even if she can protect\nthe valuables inside the house, she\ncan't protect the things in the manory\nyard. She has vegetables growing on her\n18 farms. If they get stolen, it will be\na real problem. Fong Yu then used a\nsilver knife to cut a small gash on his\nfingertip and dripped a drop of blood\nonto the seed of the demonic tentacle\nvine. The blood on the surface of the\nseed was quickly absorbed, and cracks\nappeared in the seed's outer shell. Soon\nafter, a thin tentacle as thin as a\ntoothpick emerged from the seed. This\ntentacle is very similar to the one fawn\nyou saw on the lottery wheel before.\nBoth are blackish purple, so it seems to\nbe a product of being corrupted by an\nevil god. After the small tentacle\nemerged, it trembled slightly in the air\nbefore standing upright. The tip of the\ntentacle opened slightly, revealing an\neyeball the size of a sesame seed. It\nlooked around as if searching for\nsomething. After finally determining\nFong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s location, the tentacles\nslowly grew longer and eventually\ntouched Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s finger. Won't this\nthing bite me? Fong Yu was a little\npanicked because he remembered that the\ngame assistant's description said that\nthis thing ate corpses. Fortunately, the\ntentacle only brushed against Fong\nYu&lt;unk&gt;s fingers before looking around\nagain. It saw Alpha sitting to the side,\nand its small eyes revealed great greed.\nA gaping hole full of fangs appeared\nbelow the eyeball at the tip of its\ntentacle, and it snapped at Alpha. This\nsight startled Alpha, who immediately\nraised its claw and slapped the little\ntentacle onto the table. Fong Yu, both\namused and exasperated, pulled the\nlittle tentacle back and said to it,\n\"This is one of our own. You can't\nattack it.\" And her, too. Fong Yu\npointed to Olivia and said, \"She's one\nof our own, too. You can't attack her\neither.\" The little tentacle nodded\nsadly. Fong Yu realized that it was\nprobably looking for food. So, he took a\nplate of leftover fried meat that had\nbeen prepared for the Book of Evil Gods\nand placed it in front of the little\ntentacle, saying, \"Eat this first.\" The\nlittle tentacle circled the much larger\npiece of meat around itself, then\nrevealed its mouth parts and began to\ntear at it. This guy ate really fast. In\nless than 2 minutes, it had completely\ndevoured the much larger piece of meat.\nBy this time, the little tentacle\nmonster had grown to the size of an\napple, and its tentacle had grown to the\nthickness of a finger. This growth rate\nwas quite astonishing. Well, the overall\ndesign looks a bit like, well, you know,\nit really does increase the number of\ntentacles by eating meat. But this\ntentacle is quite thin. It probably\ncan't even kill a pheasant. It needs to\nbe fed some more. So, Fong, you took out\nmore than a dozen pieces of pigheaded\nman's meat from the refrigerator and\nbegan feeding it to the demonic tentacle\nvine. After consuming another five\npieces of meat, the little tentacle\nmonster finally grew to the size of a\npumpkin and sprouted a second tentacle.\nSigh. They're all meat- eating\nancestors. Fongu sighed helplessly. He\nfelt he could no longer afford to\nsupport the book of evil gods and the\ndemonic tentacle vine. At this point,\nthe game assistant provided a prompt.\nAfter planting the magic tentacle vine\nunderground, it will hunt within a 50 m\nradius of the house. It doesn't need to\nbe fed, and you can also command it to\nenter a dormant state or specifically\ntarget enemies. By the way, after the\nmagic tentacle vine has consumed a\ncertain number of corpses, it will\nevolve into a purple epic grade magic\ntentacle lord. Wow, it can hunt on its\nown. and it can even evolve to the\npurple rank. This was an unexpected\ndelight. So, Fong Youu took the demonic\ntentacle vine outside and placed it on\nthe ground. The moment the demonic\ntentacle vine touched the ground, it was\nlike a fish entering water. Before Fong\nYu could react, it burrowed into the\nsoil, leaving only a hole in the ground.\nThen a tentacle emerged from the hole\nand the eyeball at the tip of the\ntentacle winked at Fong Yu as if it\nwanted to play hideand seek with him.\nFong Yu smiled helplessly and instructed\nthe demonic tentacle vine. You can hunt\nany animals that come near the manor,\nbut if a human like me approaches the\nmanor, you must first drive them away.\nOnly if driving them away is\nineffective, or if they attack you, can\nyou retaliate. Understand? Upon hearing\nthis, the little tentacle nodded in\nbewilderment and then burrowed\nunderground. After settling the magic\ntouch vine, Fongu returned to his house,\ntook out the newly crafted wild boar\narmor from the crafting table, and put\nit up for sale on the exchange. He also\ncollected a batch of supplies he had\nobtained from selling equipment earlier\nfrom his mailbox. As supplies poured\ninto the warehouse, Fong Yu smiled\nslightly and asked the game assistant,\nXiaolu, what is the total amount of\nsupplies I currently possess. Your\ncurrent total resource value is\n2,398,855.\nHow much more? Fongu stared at the\nsubtitles in front of him. And after\nconfirming that it was more than 2.3\nmillion, he exclaimed in surprise. Luzi,\nyou must have miscalculated. Where would\nI get more than 2 million worth of\nsupplies? You have obtained two divine\nartifacts, the book of the evil god and\nthe magic refrigerator of the ice\ngoddess. The system values each artifact\nat 1 million, although their actual\nvalue may be higher. I see. More than 2\nmillion, Fongu chuckled. With this in\nmind, his position as number one on the\nresource ranking list should be secure\nunless there are other lucky people who\ncan obtain more than two artifacts.\nImmediately, Funu opened the house\nupgrade interface and prepared to start\nupgrading the house. Haunted manor one\none kitchen, one bathroom, one yard,\n100sqm interior, 100sqm yard. Haunted\nManner twostar. Three bedrooms, one\nliving room, one kitchen, one bathroom,\none yard, 130sqm interior, 200sqm yard.\nUpgrade requirements with 73795/3000\ngravel 34510/2000\nmud 5030/500\nvines 4360/300\nbones 145500.\nSpecial items. Giant beast remains 1.\nTombstone 0/10. Magic crystal 109/10.\nCannot be upgraded. Damn it. I went to\nthe Yorktown ruins this morning and was\nso busy dealing with those players that\nI completely forgot to get the\ntombstones. And we don't even have\nenough mud and bones. Fongu slapped his\nforehead. He first opened the exchange\nand bought enough mud and bones to put\nin the warehouse. Then he prepared to\ntake Alpha and Olivia to the Yorktown\nruins to get the tombstone back, etc.\nWhy can't I make my own new tombstone?\nFu realized what was happening and\nimmediately open the crafting table to\nlook up how to make a tombstone.\nTombstone crafting requirements. 0 to\none large stone blocks. None cannot be\ncrafted. Large stones. Large stone\nblock. Green intermediate building\nmaterial requires a skilled miner to use\nspecialized tools and chisel skills to\nobtain. Fongu then opened the exchange\nand searched around, but no one was\nselling such large stones. Forget it.\nI'll just go and move what's already\nthere. So Fongu finally took Alpha and\nOlivia out the door, preparing to head\nto the Yorktown ruins. Before they could\neven leave the manor, Alfa suddenly\nturned fierce and roared at the woods to\nthe east. Olivia then took the iron axe\noff her back and said to Fong Yu with a\nserious expression, \"Master, a powerful\nmonster is coming.\" Chapter 112. Battle\nin the manor. Upon hearing Olivia&lt;unk&gt;s\nreminder, Fongu frowned immediately. If\nOlivia called it a powerful monster, it\nmust be an extremely troublesome fellow.\nFongu turned his head to look at the\nwoods to the east. He saw a giant spider\nas tall as a two-story building emerge\nfrom the swaying trees followed by\ncountless other spiders. When Fong Yu\nsaw the giant dark blue spider, he\nimmediately realized the problem. Its\nappearance was almost identical to that\nof the demon pattern giant spider. So,\nit must be a descendant of that demon\npattern giant spider. Thinking about it\ncarefully, stealing the remains of\nsomeone's ancestor and putting them in\nhuman society is the same as desecrating\nsomeone's ancestral grave. Those are\nirreconcilable feuds. So, it's normal\nfor them to come looking for revenge. At\nthis moment, Fongu was unaware that the\ngrudge between this giant spider and him\nwas far more than just this. Seeing that\nthe giant spider had smashed through the\nwooden fence at the edge of the manor\nand rushed into the manor, Fong Yu\nquickly entered combat mode. At the same\ntime, he threw a fireball at the giant\nspider and took out a bow and arrow from\nhis backpack, shooting it at the giant\nspider's six eyes. Strike first. At the\nsame time, Alpha and Olivia charged\ntowards the swarming spiders. Humans\nmight waste time exchanging pleasantries\nbefore a battle, but there's no such\ntalk between humans and monsters. The\nbattle begins with lightning speed. The\nfireballs and arrows that Fongu fired\nwere quite lethal, especially since the\ntarget was the giant spider's vulnerable\nspot, its eyes. He knew the giant spider\nwould try to defend itself, but the only\nparts of the giant spider that could\ndefend itself were its two front claws.\nDue to the angle and timing, Fongu\nconcluded that it could only choose to\nintercept one attack, and the other\nattack would definitely hit. This was a\ntactic that Fong Yu came up with in a\nflash before the battle began, and it\nwas also a hidden benefit brought about\nby reaching an intelligence level of 10.\nAs expected, the fireball that flew\nfirst was blocked by the giant spider's\nfront claws, while the arrow, guided by\nFong Us mental power, passed through the\ngap in the giant spider's front claws,\nand pierced one of the giant spider's\neyes. A woo! The giant spider let out a\npainful howl and took a step back, but\nthat was all. The arrow did not cause\nmuch damage to the giant spider.\nAlthough it blew out one of the giant\nspider's eyes, it still had five other\neyes. The intense pain drove the giant\nspider into a frenzy. It charged at Fong\nYu with its six hooked legs, seemingly\nwanting to tear him to shreds with its\ntwo sharp front claws. Upon seeing this,\nFong Yu immediately activated the wind\nwalker's guardian magic ring on his\nfinger, increasing his agility by three\npoints. He then quickly ran out of the\nmanor, intending to enter the forest.\nThe dense forest could slow down the\ngiant spider's advance and create more\nopportunities for Fongu to attack.\nAnother reason was that he didn't want\nto make the battlefield his own manner.\nOtherwise, after a major battle, his\nfarmland would definitely be lost. And\nwith the giant spider's massive size,\nwhich was two stories high, even the\nmain structure of the wooden house\nprobably wouldn't be able to withstand a\nfew of its impacts. Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s plan\nwas good, and his reaction was quick. He\nsoon ran to the wooden fence on the west\nside of the manor. Once he got out of\nthe fence, he could rush into the woods\nin just a few steps. However, at this\ncritical moment, a thin spider silk shot\nout from behind Fong Yu, accurately\nsticking to Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s ankle and\ntripping him to the ground. Before Fong\nYu could react, the spider silk around\nhis ankle began to pull him back. And at\nthe end of the silk was the giant blue\nspider. In a moment of desperation, Fong\nYu immediately took out an iron ax from\nhis backpack and turned around to chop\nat the spider silk. To his surprise, the\nspider silk was much tougher than\nordinary spider silk. With Funu's full\nforce strike, the iron axe only cut a\nsmall strand of the spider silk. Judging\nfrom the situation, it would be\nimpossible to cut it off without 20 or\n30 strikes. As he watched himself being\ndragged little by little towards the\ngiant blue spider by the spider silk,\nFong Yu slammed his ax into the ground\nto increase friction and began to chant\nthe incantation for a fireball spell.\nSoon a fireball appeared in his empty\nhand, and he hurled it at the spider\nsilk around his ankle. Although the\nresilience of spider silk can reduce a\nlot of physical damage, it melts as\nquickly as ice and snow under the\nscorching heat of flames. With a crisp\nclang, the spider silk was melted by the\nfireball in Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s hand. The\ngiant spider in the distance took a step\nback due to inertia, and Fong Yu took\nthe opportunity to get up from the\nground and rush towards the wild boar\nforest to the west. Seeing this, the\ngiant blue spider let out another angry\nshriek and followed Fong Yu into the\nwoods to the west. As for Alpha and\nOlivia, they were still trapped in a\ndense swarm of spiders. Even though\nhundreds of spider corpses had piled up\naround them, spiders continued to crawl\nout of the forest and swarmed towards\nthem. Olivia noticed Fong Yu's departure\nat that moment. After wielding her iron\nax to shield Alpha from a spider's\nattack, she shouted, \"Leave this to me.\nYou go help the master.\" Upon hearing\nthis, Alfa released the spider corpse\nfrom its mouth, leaped onto the nearby\nwooden house to escape the spider swarm,\nand then after a few more leaps, rushed\ninto the woods to the west. At this\nmoment, Olivia was left fighting alone\nin the entire manor. Although she was\nimmortal, one-on-one combat was actually\nher forte as a warrior. However, she was\nstill somewhat powerless against this\nswarm of insects because she lacked\ngroup attack skills. Damn it. If I could\nabsorb more life force and recover to\nthe level of a great swordsman, I could\nuse some powerful skills. Olivia gritted\nher teeth and swung the iron axe in her\nhand. Even though she was immortal, her\narms still felt sore after swinging the\niron axe hundreds of times. She wanted\nto escape the spider's encirclement and\nhead to the woods to the west to help\nher master, but she knew that if she\nabandoned the manor's defenses, the\ncabin would likely be destroyed by the\nspider's attacks. Sigh. I shouldn't have\nbeen so harsh on Tina last night, Olivia\nsaid with some regret. If she hadn't\nbeen injured, she could probably have\ncome out and helped by now. As time went\non, Olivia's unease grew stronger.\nCompared to the safety of the manor, she\nseemed more worried about Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s\nsafety. Just then, Olivia noticed a\nslight commotion in the spider swarm.\nTaking a moment to look closely between\nher attacks, she discovered that dozens\nof strange purplish brown tentacles had\nsilently emerged from the ground of the\nmanor. These tentacles varied in\nthickness and length, but all had a\nmouthpiece at the tip filled with sharp\nfangs. After breaking through the soil,\nthese eerie tentacles attacked the\nnearest spiders, using their flexible\nand slender bodies to wrap around them\nand then tearing and devouring them with\ntheir sharp mouth parts. Although the\nspiders attacked by the tentacles do\nbite back, the tentacle skin is much\nharder than it appears. The spider's\nfangs have difficulty piercing the\ntentacles skin. And even when some\nrelatively large spiders managed to bite\nthrough the tentacle skin, their venom\nseems to have no effect on these\ntentacles. Thus, under the strangulation\nand biting of these tentacles, a large\nnumber of spiders began to die and be\ndevoured by the tentacles. And then even\nmore tentacles emerged from the ground.\nAs more and more spiders died from the\ntentacles attacks, Olivia finally\nbreathed a sigh of relief. She knew that\nthe magic vines her master had just\nplanted were working. As more and more\nspiders died, more and more tentacles\nappeared on the ground, and the swarm of\nspiders attacking the manor was finally\ncontained. With Master's current\nstrength, even with Alpha's help, it\nwould probably be difficult to defeat\nthat giant spider. Olivia glanced at the\nwild boar forest to the west, then\ncharged toward the woods with her blood\ndripping iron axe in her hand. Chapter\n113. The battle of the pigs and spiders.\nFong Yu is now in a sorry state. He is\nfleeing in a disheveled manner. The\nsound of trees hitting and rubbing\nagainst each other kept coming from\nbehind. The giant blue spider was\nchasing it not far behind. Every time\nFong Yu wanted to curse, \"What the hell\nis the grudge? What grudge is there that\nmakes it chase after me so relentlessly?\nHe could only swallow the curse back\ndown. After all, I carried away someone\nelse's ancestor. He attempted to summon\nthe forest guardian, the tree spirit, to\nhelp him fight off the giant spider by\nsetting fire to the forest, but the game\nassistant immediately warned him that if\nhe angered the forest spirit three times\nin a row on the same day, he would be\nlocked by the forest spirit and would\nnever be able to enter the forest again.\nHelpless, Fong Yu could only run wildly\nthrough the forest, trying to widen the\ndistance between himself and the giant\nspider behind him. But no matter how\nfast someone with short legs runs, they\ncan't outrun someone with long legs. His\nlegs were only 1 m long. But the giant\nspider's hooked legs were at least 2 m\nlong, and there were six of them. Who\nthe hell could outrun it? If it weren't\nfor the giant tree blocking their way\nand Alpha's harassment of the giant\nspider, Fongu would probably have been\ncaught long ago. After frantically\ndashing left and right through the woods\nfor a minute, Fong Yu finally remembered\nthat he seemed to have an invisibility\ncloak. Damn it, how could I forget that?\nAs Fong Yu ran, he took out the\ninvisibility cloak he had obtained from\nthe ungrateful woman from his backpack\nand quickly put it on. After dawning the\ncloak, Fun Yu immediately sensed that\nthe giant spider behind him had stopped\nmoving, so he also stopped and began to\ncatch his breath. To be honest, most\npeople couldn't sustain this kind of\nfrantic running for long. Taking\nadvantage of this rare opportunity to\ncatch his breath, Fongu began to think\nabout how to deal with the giant spider\nbehind him. At this point, a direct\nconfrontation is definitely not an\noption. After all, the main tank and\nmain damage dealer, Olivia, is not here.\nAnd I, as a mage, am too fragile. If I\nmake even one mistake, I'll probably\nlose my life. Therefore, the only way to\ndefeat the giant spider is through\nstrategy. Fu opened his backpack and\nglanced inside. There were 23 explosive\npacks left, which were his main means of\nattack. However, the game assistant had\njust mentioned that if he angered the\nforest spirit three times in the same\nday, he would be marked and it would be\ndifficult for him to enter the forest\nagain. Therefore, he could not use the\nexplosive packs for the time being with\nhis primary ranged attack method\nrestricted and his melee skills inferior\neven to alphas. Going there would be\nnothing more than feeding kills, which\nput Fong Yu in a dilemma. Just as Fong\nYu was at his wits end, the giant spider\nsuddenly let out a shriek, followed by a\nvisible gray wave radiating from its\nbody. Instantly, any plants and insects\nthat came into contact with this gray\nwave were blasted away, and any living\ncreature that came into contact with the\ngray wave was marked by the giant spider\nand continuously corroded by the shadow\nenergy. This is the dark magic that the\ngiant spider learned from its ancestor,\nshadow strike. Although Fong Yu didn't\nknow what the gray fluctuations were,\nhis intuition told him that they were\ndefinitely not good things. He should\navoid them if possible, so he could only\nretreat deeper into the forest. As soon\nas he moved, the sound of the fallen\nleaves being crushed under his feet and\nthe sound of him moving through the\nbushes were detected by the giant\nspider. So, the giant spider once again\nfollowed Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s trail. This time,\nhowever, Fongu was no longer running\naimlessly. Instead, he ran straight into\nthe depths of the forest because he had\nfinally figured out a way to deal with\nthe giant spider. One minute later,\nafter passing through a thicket, Fong Yu\nspotted a group of wild boars foraging\nin the woods. Upon seeing the wild\nboars, Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s lips curled up\nslightly. After scanning the area, he\ncharged towards the largest boar lord in\nthe center of the herd. A few seconds\nlater, the giant blue spider also\ncrashed through the bushes and charged\nover. The commotion caused by its huge\nsize naturally attracted the attention\nof the wild boar herd. In an instant,\nall the wild boars roared warningly at\nthe giant spider that had suddenly\ninvaded their territory. seeing hundreds\nof wild boares roaring at it. Even the\ngiant spider was a little scared,\nespecially since there was a boar lord\nin the center of the herd that was about\nthe same size as it, and its four thick,\nlong, and sharp tusks made the giant\nspider a little frightened. If the giant\nspider had brought a swarm of spiders,\nit might have been able to put up a\nfight against the wild boars head-on.\nAfter all, it was a mutated creature and\nhad awakened the demonic spider\nbloodline of its ancestor, learning\nshadow magic. With its swarm of spiders,\nit could have easily defeated the wild\nboars in front of it. But at this\nmoment, the giant spider came alone, so\nit was not confident of victory against\nthe group of wild boars. For a moment,\nit hesitated, wondering whether it\nshould continue to pursue that damned\nhuman. Just as the giant spider\nhesitated, Fong Yu, standing in the herd\nof pigs, removed his invisibility cloak,\ndrew his bow, and fired three arrows\ninto the giant spider's eyes. The first\ntwo arrows were successfully blocked by\nthe giant spider's pincers, but the\nthird arrow still managed to penetrate\nthe giant spider's defenses and blew out\none of its eyeballs. A woo! After\nletting out a miserable howl, the\nintense pain finally ignited the\nmonster's frenzy, and it charged towards\nFong Yu without regard for anything\nelse. The reason Fong Yu dared to remove\nhis invisibility cloak in the wild boar\nherd was because he was wearing a full\nset of wild boar armor. The set effect\nof the wild boar armor was that it would\nmake nearby wild boores mistake him for\none of their own. As long as he did not\nattack the wild boars, he could blend\ninto the wild boar herd. He had always\nthought that the set bonus was utterly\nuseless, even worse than a chicken bone.\nBut now he realized that the set bonus\nwas incredibly awesome. Now the wild\nboars around him have all become his\nguards, especially a boar lord whose\nsize is no less than that of a giant\nspider. Therefore, Fong Yu dared to\nshoot at the giant spider again without\nrestraint in order to provoke it once\nmore and make it charge into the wild\nboar herd. In that case, the two sides\nwould inevitably fight each other, and\nFong Yu could simply sit back and reap\nthe benefits. Sure enough, when the\ngiant spider rushed into the boar herds\nterritory, the adult boores all let out\na howl and charged at the giant spider.\nHowever, even though those adult wild\nboores were over 3 m long, they were\nstill no match for the giant spider,\nwhich was as tall as a two-story\nbuilding and had a leg span of over 10\nm. The first wild boar that charged at\nthe giant spider was inevitably pierced\nby the spider's front pinsers, pinned to\nthe ground, and died with a mournful\ncry. But then a second and a third wild\nboar charged at them when a dozen or so\nadult wild boores launched a brutal\ncharge. Even the giant spider could not\nwithstand the relentless onslaught.\nSoon, one of its hooked legs was broken\noff, and its soft abdomen was pierced by\nthe boar's tusks, causing a large amount\nof yellowish green fluid to flow out.\nThe giant spider, writhing in pain,\nglanced at the wild boars around it,\nthen let out a sharp shriek, its body\nonce again radiating a gray, shadowy\naura. In an instant, the wild boars\naround the giant spider were blasted\naway by the shadow wave. And under the\ncorrosive effect of the shadow energy,\nthey writhed and howled in pain. Their\nflesh and blood quickly turning into\npools of foul smelling pus. Seeing the\nwild boars that had been turned into pus\nby the shadow impact, Fong Yu felt a\nwave of fear. Luckily, he had run fast,\notherwise the consequences would have\nbeen unimaginable. Meanwhile, as large\nnumbers of wild boars died, the boar\nlord in the center of the herd finally\nstood up. Its eyes turned red, its\nbristles, like steel needles, stood on\nend, and its massive hooves, like stone\nblocks, began to scratch the ground. A\nwoo! The boar lord let out an angry roar\nand charged toward the giant spider that\ndared to invade its territory. Chapter\n114. Shifting the blame eastward, using\na pig to kill a spider. How powerful is\nthe impact of a wild boar that is over 5\nm tall and over 10 m long? Could we just\nsmash that giant spider to death in one\ngo? Fongu was very much looking forward\nto it. Unfortunately, Fongu didn't get\nto see the scene he was looking forward\nto because the giant blue spider\nsuddenly swung its abdomen and shot a\nbundle of milky white spiderw webs at\nthe bore lord that was charging towards\nit. The spiderweb automatically unfolded\nduring flight, becoming a huge net that\ncovered the boar lord's body. At that\nmoment, as the giant spider swung its\nabdomen, Fong Yu also saw the familiar\nhumanface pattern on its abdomen.\nHuman-faced demon spider. Fong Yu\nfinally recognized the giant spider in\nfront of him. It turned out to be the\nsame human-faced demon spider that he\nhad burned down and attacked him last\ntime. No wonder this guy harbors such a\ndeep grudge against me. Funu shook his\nhead with a rice smile. Meanwhile, the\nboar lord, trapped in the spiderweb,\nbegan to struggle, trying to tear the\nweb off its body. However, the web's\nstrong adhesiveness only stuck the\nboar's limbs and torso together, causing\nit to lose its balance and fall to the\nground with a thud. It tried to get up,\nbut the spiderwebs attached to its limbs\ngreatly restricted its ability to move.\nAt this moment, the giant spider crawled\ntowards the boar lord, who was\nstruggling on the ground, seemingly\nintending to finish it off while the\nboar lord was unable to move. The boar\nlord naturally sensed the danger and\nbegan to howl. As its howl rang out, the\nremaining wild boars around it launched\nanother collective charge against the\ngiant spider. Meanwhile, Fong Yu, who\nwas hiding in the distance, took this\nopportunity to shoot five more arrows at\nthe giant spider's eyes. The first three\narrows were blocked by the giant spider\nwhich was prepared. However, when the\nfourth arrow was shot, the giant spider\nwas unable to defend itself against\nFongu's arrow because it had to use its\nfront claws to block the wild boars that\nwere attacking it. So, the arrow hit the\ngiant spider's abdomen. The last arrow\nhit one of the giant spider's eyes\nagain. At this moment, three of the\ngiant spider's six eyes had been blinded\nby Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s arrows. Meanwhile,\nunder the barrage of tusks from dozens\nof adult wild boores, the giant spider\nsustained more and more wounds,\nespecially on its soft abdomen where\nseveral large lacerations had appeared\nwith large amounts of colorful internal\norgans and intestines spilling out.\nThese massive lacerations were left by\nalpha, which infiltrated the wild boar\nherd and launched attacks. Its sharp\nclaws were far more damaging than the\nboar's tusks. Just when Fong Yu thought\nthat the giant spider would soon be\nkilled by him, Alpha and the boar heard,\nthe giant spider released that strange\ngray wave again. Shadow impact.\nInstantly, a large number of wild boars\nsurrounding the giant spider collapsed\nto the ground, convulsing and turning\ninto blood and dying. Even Alpha was hid\nin the hind quarters by the gray wave\nbecause he failed to evacuate in time.\nFortunately, it had a layer of\nfluttering red fur to protect it. Even\nso, the gray shadow energy quickly\ncorroded the red fur on Alpha's body,\ncompletely corroding the fur on the back\nhalf of its body, revealing the blood\nred muscle fascia. Alpha cried out in\npain and leaped away with all its might\nto create distance between itself and\nthe giant spider before collapsing into\nthe grass. Fongu was shocked to see this\nand immediately ran towards Alpha. The\ngiant spider, which had dealt with the\nsurrounding wild boores, also saw Fong\nYu. The giant spider had gone berserk\ndue to its injuries. It raised its tail\nand shot a ball of silk at Fong Yu. But\nbecause of its severe abdominal injury,\nthe raised tail aggravated the torn\nwound. In its agony, the silk shot out\nlost its aim and brushed past Fong Yu,\nwho was running away. The giant spider,\nunwilling to give up, began to take\nsteps, trying to chase Fong Yu. But at\nthis moment, the borelord finally broke\nfree from the spider web and got up from\nthe ground, roaring as it charged at the\ngiant spider. In its pursuit of Fong Yu,\nthe giant spider completely exposed its\nback to the charging boar lord. By the\ntime the giant spider realized what was\nhappening, the borelord's four huge and\nthick tusks had already pierced deep\ninto the giant spider's abdomen. With a\nsudden flick of its head, the Borelord's\nfour thick tusks tore open form massive\nintersecting gashes on the giant\nspider's abdomen. These gashes were far\nlarger than those caused by the alpha\nclaws. The moment the boar king pulled\nout its tusks, a large amount of\ninternal organs from the giant spider's\nabdomen gushed out, mixed with streams\nof foul smelling yellowish green pus\nsplattering all over the ground. Piss.\nThe giant spider let out a long, painful\nhiss. And with its last bit of strength,\ndragging its shrunken abdomen, it\nflipped over and leaped onto the boar\nlord's back, biting down hard on the\nboar lord's neck. Oh. In pain, the boar\nlord began to jump sideways, quickly,\nthrowing the giant spider off its back.\nAfter landing, the giant spider twitched\nits six claws upwards for a moment\nbefore becoming still. Meanwhile, the\nboar lord, corroded by the giant\nspider's venom, quickly collapsed to the\nground, convulsing and foaming at the\nmouth before slowly dying. At this\nmoment, Fongu had already run to where\nAlpha had fallen. After searching\nthrough the grass for a while, he\nfinally found the unconscious Alpha.\nAlpha's hindquarters had been corroded\nby shadow energy, leaving it a bloody\nmess. looking even worse than when Fong\nYu first saw it. Fong Yu anxiously took\nout spider gland ointment from his\nbackpack, wanting to apply it to Alpha.\nBut at that moment, a hand reached out\nfrom the side and grabbed Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s\nhand. Fongu was shocked and turned\naround to look, only to find that the\nperson grabbing his arm was Olivia, who\nhad arrived at some unknown time.\n\"Master, you can't touch Alpha right\nnow.\" Olivia, who had just arrived,\ngrabbed Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s hand and said,\n\"There is still residual shadow energy\non its body. If you touch it, the shadow\nenergy will corrode you along with it.\nWhat do we do then?\" Fong Yu asked\nanxiously. \"Are we just going to watch\nit like this? Won't Alpha be completely\ncorrupted and killed by the shadow\nenergy?\" Olivia shook her head and said,\n\"No, it has demonic blood, which gives\nit a strong resistance to shadow energy.\nIt will slowly recover once the shadow\nenergy dissipates. Hearing Olivia's\nwords, Fongu breathed a sigh of relief\nand said, \"Ph, it's all right. If\nanything had happened to it, I would\nhave felt terribly guilty.\" Looking at\nFong Yu, who was blaming himself, Olivia\nsmiled slightly and said, \"Master,\nthere's no need to blame yourself.\nYou've done very well. You actually\nthought of using the wild boars in the\nforest to surround and attack that\nhuman-faced spider and successfully\nkilled it. Upon hearing this, Funu\nturned to look at the giant spider's\ncorpse lying on the ground in the\ndistance. He was filled with emotion.\nToday's encounter had caught him\ncompletely offguard. First, Valentina\ncouldn't go out during the day, leaving\nher without a mage with crucial AoE\ndamage. Then, her own explosives were\nalso unusable due to the forest spirit.\nFortunately, he had a flash of\ninspiration and upon seeing the wild\nboar armor he was wearing came up with\nthe idea of diverting the trouble to\nsomeone else to kill the giant spider.\nIn the end, he successfully killed the\nterrifying giant spider. Just when Fong\nYu thought he could finally breathe a\nsigh of relief and was preparing to\nclean up the battlefield, suddenly his\nfriend list started flashing. Fong Yu\nopened it and saw that it was a series\nof messages from Song Juming, the fat\nguy, Lu Xiao Fang, and Xiao Yini, the\npresident of the Women's Federation.\nFongu clicked on it to take a look. Song\nJiming ID 3533. Brother Fong, something\nterrible has happened. The ruins have\nbeen attacked. Come back quickly. Lu\nXiaoang, boss, we need backup. A large\nnumber of orcs have appeared outside the\nYorktown ruins. Xiao Yini, ID909. Hey\nbro, where are you? Hurry back to\nYorktown ruins. We're surrounded by\nmonsters. Chapter 115. The Cobalts\nmaking deals. Fonu frowned upon seeing\nthe three messages requesting help. Why\nare there so many orcs appearing outside\nYorktown again? Didn't I already wipe\nout all the pigheaded men in the ruins\nyesterday? Funu didn't have time to\nthink about it. He first found a wild\nboar carcass that was still relatively\nintact. He used the systems\ndecomposition skill to decompose it and\nobtained two pieces of wild boar hide.\nHe then took out the wild boar hide and\nwrapped it around Alpha, preparing to\ncarry Alpha back to the manor. Leave it\nto me, Olivia said, extending her hand.\nFongu didn't stand on ceremony. He had\nOlivia pick up Alpha, and the two\nquickly returned to the manor. As for\nthe giant spider corpse and the\nborelord's corpse left behind on this\nbattlefield, Fong Yu planned to deal\nwith them after he finished dealing with\nthe matter in Yorktown. After rushing\nback to the manor, Fongu found it\ncompletely clean. Not a single spider\ncorpse was left. Only spider blood\nstains and a few broken purplish black\ntentacles. After seeing the tentacles,\nFongu realized that the demonic tentacle\nvine must have dealt with the spider\nswarm in the manor and swallowed the\nspider corpses in the process. Although\nI felt a little sorry for the spider\nflesh on those spider corpses, the\nthought that the demonic tentacle vine\ncould grow a tentacle for every corpse\nit devoured didn't seem like a bad deal.\nThere were at least 300 to 400 spiders\nthat rushed into the manor just now,\nwhich meant that there were currently\nthree to 400 terrifying man-eating\ntentacles hidden underground in the\nmanor. Tsk tsk. It seems the manor's\ndefenses are finally somewhat secure.\nSoon, Olivia took the injured Alpha into\nValentina's room and then followed Fongu\nout again. Valentina's magic can speed\nup the removal of the shadow energy from\nAlpha, so Alpha will be fine. Master,\nplease don't worry. Olivia reassured her\nagain. Fong Yu nodded and ran towards\nYorktown with Olivia. 15 minutes later,\nwith Olivia's help, Fong Yu crossed the\nriver and the two quickly arrived at the\ngrassy area in front of the Yorktown\nruins. Looking around, a group of\nstrange hunched over figures were now\nstanding on the open ground where the\nplayers had gathered for a meeting that\nmorning. Fongu squinted and examined\nthem carefully before discovering that\nthe strange people actually had dog\nheads and their exposed skin was covered\nwith a layer of mixed hair of different\ncolors. They were a bunch of cobalts and\nthere were probably more than 60 of\nthem. So Fong Yu continued to observe.\nThese cobalts were dressed in simple\nlinen clothes and carried some crude\nwooden sticks or stone picks. What\npuzzled Fong Yu was that they all seemed\nto be carrying large backpacks, the\ncontents of which were unknown, and they\ndidn't seem to be about to fight, etc.\nFong Yu raised an eyebrow, wondering to\nhimself. There were nearly 200 players\ngathered at the meeting this morning,\nright? And these 200 people were\nsurrounded by more than 60 cobalts. Are\nyou kidding me? At this moment, the\ncollapsed section of the city wall at\nthe Yorktown ruins had been rebuilt into\na 3 m high low wall from the rubble.\nSeveral players holding bows and arrows\nstood on the low wall, staring at the\ncobalts outside, but none of them dared\nto shoot. Strangely, the cobalts outside\nthe wall did not seem to have any\nintention of attacking the city, and the\ntwo sides remained deadlocked. Fongu was\nboth amused and exasperated. He had\ninitially thought it was a crisis\ninvolving a massive orc army, but it\nturned out to be just a minor skirmish.\nThese few cobalts were so small that\nOlivia didn't even need to lift a\nfinger. Three or four explosive packs\nwould have been enough to take care of\nthem. So, Fong Yu stopped hiding and\nwalked out of the bushes, leading Olivia\ntoward the group of cobalts. Fong\nYu&lt;unk&gt;s figure was quickly spotted by\nseveral players on the stone wall. After\nrecognizing him, they excitedly spoke to\nthe players below the wall behind them.\nSoon after, Fatty Song climbed up the\nstone wall. After confirming that it was\nFong Yu, he immediately beamed and said\nsomething to the players around him.\nImmediately afterwards, Fong Yu received\na message from Fatty Song. Jimming ID\n3533, brother Fong, hurry up and kill\nthose bastards. It'll be a good\nopportunity for you to establish your\nauthority once again. Fong Yu looked up\nand rolled his eyes at Fatty Song on the\nstone wall, ignoring the guy. Soon, Fong\nYu arrived in front of the group of\ncobalts, one hand behind his back,\nholding a bomb, but his face was all\nsmiles as he greeted the cobalts who had\nspotted him. \"Hello, I wonder what\nbrings you here.\" Upon hearing Fong\nYu&lt;unk&gt;s words, one of the oldest\nlooking hounds stepped forward from his\ncompanions, looked at Fong Yu, and said,\n\"Woof woof woof woof woof.\" The game's\nlanguage system only translates the\ncommon language of mainland China and\ndoes not translate the languages of\nminority groups. Fongu took a deep\nbreath and then exhaled. He finally\nunderstood why the players in the city\nwere at an impass with these cobalts. It\nwas because of the language barrier.\nFortunately, Olivia spoke up at that\nmoment. Master, this do-headed man says\nthey've come to make a deal with the\npigheaded man. A trade. Fongu raised an\neyebrow upon hearing this. Then looked\nat the huge packages carried on the\nbacks of the cobalts and suddenly\nrealized. No wonder they didn't attack\nthe players in the city right away. They\nwere here to do business with the\npigmen. Can you understand what they're\nsaying? Fongu asked Olivia. Olivia\nnodded and replied, \"I've studied it\nbefore.\" So Fong Yu asked Olivia to\ntranslate. Tell them that the pig-headed\nman is gone and they can bring out any\ngoods they have to look at. If they are\nsuitable, I will accept them. After\nlistening to Olivia's translation, the\ncobalt looked at Fong Yu with a\nsuspicious expression and then said\nsomething else. Olivia translated. It\nsaid they needed food, meat, vegetables,\nand fruit, and asked us if we had any.\nFongu raised his finger and pointed to\nthe large field full of crops next to\nhim, as well as the orchard next to the\nruins, and said, \"These are all mine,\nand I can trade with you for them.\"\nAfter listening to Olivia's translation,\nthe cobalt shook his head and said\nsomething else. This time, Olivia\nactually replied with a string of words.\nImmediately, Fong Yu saw the cobalt's\nexpression changed drastically. When he\nlooked at Fong Yu again, his expression\nwas much more respectful. \"What did you\ntwo just say?\" Fongu asked curiously.\n\"It says it knows this territory belongs\nto the pigheaded people, not you,\"\nOlivia replied. I told it that all the\npigheaded people here have been killed\nby you and your servants. At this\nmoment, the cobalt opposite had already\ncalled to his companions to unload the\npacks on their backs and pour the\nsupplies inside onto Fongu. Instantly,\nthe ground in front of Fongu was filled\nwith a large pile of low to medium grade\nores such as coal, iron ore, salt peter,\nand sulfur ore. Chapter 116. Living\nwithout contention. Looking at the\ndazzling array of ores scattered on the\nground, Fong Yu raised an eyebrow and\nasked the cobalts, \"How did you trade\nwith the pigheaded men before?\" After\nOlivia translated, Fong You roughly\nunderstood the situation. A piece of\nmeat can be exchanged for five pieces of\ncoal or any two pieces of ore. The\nexchange ratio between crops and ores is\nbased on weight, while some higher value\ncrops such as chili peppers and garlic\nare calculated separately. Fonu\nspecifically asked the cobalts why there\nwere no gold or silver or other\nhigh-grade minerals among these ores.\nThe cobalts replied that their king\nliked those things so they couldn't be\nexchanged for them. After thinking for a\nwhile, Fongu had the cobalts pick out\nall the sulfur ore and salt peter ore\nand then exchanged them with the\ncobalts. In the end, he exchanged 85\npieces of pigheaded meat for 72 pieces\nof sulfur ore and 98 pieces of salt\npeter ore. As for the coal and iron ore,\nFongu was too lazy to exchange them. He\nsimply waved to Song Jimming on the\nstone wall, beckoning him to come over.\nIn fact, the players on the stone wall\nhad already realized that the cobalts\nwere not there to attack them. When they\nsaw the cobalts pouring out large\namounts of or from their packs, they\nbegan to stir, realizing that this was a\ngood trading opportunity. Unfortunately,\nthe only one who could communicate with\nthe Cobalts was Fong Yu's follower. So\nthe players in the city, though envious,\ncould only watch helplessly for the time\nbeing. It wasn't until Fong Yu waved to\nSong Jimming that the players on the\nstone wall jumped down and surrounded\nhim. Fong Yu explained the exchange rate\nto the players and everyone could trade\nfreely. In an instant, a large number of\nplayers flocked to the oars and began\ntrading with the cobalts. At this\nmoment, Fongu grabbed Sanjiing, who also\nwanted to make a deal, and said, \"Don't\nrush. I have something to tell you,\nbrother. What's wrong? Tell me. I just\nfound out that these cobalts come to\ntrade once a year, usually on the second\nday of autumn, which is today, to\nexchange for food for the winter. If we\nwant to go and trade with the cobalts,\nwe can go 3 km to the east. There is a\nrift valley, and these cobalts live at\nthe bottom of that rift valley. Upon\nhearing Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s words, Sun\nJimming&lt;unk&gt;s eyes lit up. He had been\nfeeling a bit bad about missing the\nopportunity to trade with the cobalts as\nother players had snatched all the\nbenefits. But now that he knew the\nlocation of the cobalt's lair, he could\ngo there anytime to exchange for ore.\nOne piece of meat can be exchanged for\nany two pieces of ore. Currently, the\nprice of one piece of iron ore is about\nthe same as the price of meat. So, this\ncombination results in a 100% profit.\nFor this 100% profit, let alone going to\nthe cobalt's layer, it would be worth\ngoing through fire and water. Not to\nmention exchanging an equal weight of\ncrops for an equal weight of minerals.\nAlthough it may not seem like there's\nmuch profit, there's no risk in growing\ncrops. This Yorktown ruin is near the\nriver and has a large area of fertile\nland that can be cultivated, which means\nthere's a stable source of crops. And\nwith the Cobalt's trade route, there's a\nstable supply of minerals. The\nconstruction of the new city currently\nrequires a large amount of mineral\nresources and San Jimming was just\nworrying about where to mine them. Now\nhis wish has come true. Moreover, it's\nnot just here that settlements are being\nbuilt. Players from almost all 10 major\nregions are pooling their resources to\nconstruct settlements, causing the price\nof mineral resources to soar. This means\nhe can make a good profit. Fong Yu\nlooked at Song Jumming, whose eyes were\ngleaming and said irritably, \"Stop with\nyour little schemes.\" \"If you're going\nto be that lord, you can't just think\nabout your own interests.\" Understand?\nTo put it bluntly, all the communities\nare now competing for players. And if\nthey want more players to join them,\nthey need to offer something of real\nvalue to share in order to attract more\nplayers. Upon hearing this, Fattyong\nimmediately nodded seriously and said,\n\"I understand. I understand, brother\nFong. You're right. Fong Yu then added,\nI just asked those cobalts. The stone is\nworthless to them. If we are willing to\ncollect the stone from their rift, they\ncan sell it to us at a very low price.\nBut if we have them deliver it to us,\nthe price will be higher. So, it's up to\nyou how you want to trade. I understand.\nI understand. All right. I've told you\neverything I needed to. Fong Yu patted\nSong Jimming on the shoulder and asked,\n\"By the way, how did your discussions\nwith those players go after I left?\"\nUpon hearing this, Song Jimming\nimmediately perked up and laughed. He\nthat's pretty good. Besides the team\nthat has already announced its entry\ninto the Yorktown ruins, some other\nteams have also heard the news and are\npreparing to come. I've counted them and\nthe number is almost 3,000. There are\nalso many players who are too far away,\nso they plan to wait until after this\nwinter to come. Funu nodded upon hearing\nthis. This number was already quite\nlarge, and it was unlikely that all the\nusable houses in the ruins would be\ninhabited by these people. Is there\nenough food for 3,000 people? Funu\nasked. Enough? Song Jimming replied with\na smile. Those pigheaded people's houses\nalready have plenty of food stored up.\nNot to mention the farmland with its unh\nharvested crops, the orchard, and the\nberry field to the north. Besides, these\nplayers brought their entire fortunes\nwith them before they came, so there\nshouldn't be any problem. Including\ntoday, you have a day and a half left.\nHurry up and collect as many supplies as\npossible and repair as many houses in\nthe ruins as possible. Fongu reminded\nhim. I don't want to hear news of\nplayers freezing or starving to death in\ntown this winter. Understand? Song\nJimming nodded. All right, since there's\nnothing else, I'll head back now. Wait a\nminute, brother Fong. There's something\nelse. Song Jimming called out to Fong\nYu. What's up? Song Jimming rubbed his\nhands together and said apologetically.\nWell, we've all merged into a new team,\nbut we haven't decided on a name yet. My\noriginal idea was to keep using our Fong\nYu support group, but many players think\nthat since you don't want to be the\nlord, calling it Fong Yu support group\ndoesn't seem quite right. So, I was\nthinking of changing the name. What do\nyou think? Why don't you come up with\none? Fongu hadn't really thought about\nthis problem. He was terrible at naming\nthings when he was an online novelist.\nSo, asking him to come up with a name\nnow was really difficult for him. How\nabout we call it being content with\none's lot, to live without strife? Fong\nYu nodded and smiled. We are all ants\nstruggling to survive in this world.\nIt's already difficult enough to just\nstay alive. It would be even better if\nthere were fewer conflicts. In the past\n2 days, he has witnessed or even\ndirectly participated in many fights.\nThe first person he killed was Wu Fong\nLang, then the Dong Seong Gang and that\nungrateful woman and the group that\nrobbed Song Jimming. These people are\njust the tip of the iceberg engaging in\nsmall-scale activities. Once the merge\nphase begins, it will likely escalate\ninto a large-scale conflict between the\nregions, and the number of deaths may be\nfar greater than it is now. Song Jumming\nstared blankly at Fong Yu for a moment,\nthen nodded and prepared to turn around\nand go back, but then he remembered\nsomething. Should we change the name of\nour town, too? Fong Yu rolled his eyes\nand replied, \"Can't you guys come up\nwith one yourselves? Why do you have to\nmake me, the one who's terrible at\nnaming, think of one? Can't you\nbrainstorm and ask for everyone's\nopinions? After saying that, Fong Yu\nleft with Olivia. Chapter 117.\nCollecting loot. Due to the battle that\nafternoon, coupled with the delay at the\nYorktown ruins, Fong Yu returned to the\nmanor in the evening. He rushed back to\ncheck on Alpha only to find the guy fast\nasleep in his doghouse, even snoring as\nsoon as he entered the house. Fonu\nlooked at Alfa's hind quartarters and\nsaw that a layer of pink new skin had\ngrown on its hindquarters, but the fur\nhad not yet grown out, making it look\nlike a dog without pants, which was\nquite comical. So Fong, you didn't\ndisturb Alpha. He looked around and saw\nValentina making dinner for herself in\nthe kitchen. Valentina, uh, good\nevening, master. The female ghost turned\naround and greeted Fongu with a smile.\nOlivia told me you were injured last\nnight. Hm. It was just a minor injury.\nIt's all healed now. Don't worry,\nmaster. A hint of embarrassment flashed\nacross Valentina's face as she nodded\nslightly. Yeah, I ran into a dim-witted\nguy last night, and it took a lot of my\neffort. If my strength hadn't been fully\nrestored, I would have beaten that guy\nto a pulp. Humph. Fong Yu looked at her\ncondensed soul body and saw that she\nseemed to be all right. So, he breathed\na sigh of relief. Actually, Valentina's\ninjuries weren't supposed to heal. so\nquickly. That afternoon, many spiders\ndied in the manor. Although their\ncorpses were devoured by the demonic\nvines, their soul power became\nnourishment for Valentina, allowing her\nto recover from her injuries rapidly.\nI'm so sorry that I couldn't come out to\nhelp when monsters attacked our manor\ntoday,\" Valentina said apologetically.\nFongu waved his hand and said, \"What are\nyou saying? Protecting the manor should\nbe my duty as the owner. Let's not talk\nabout this. What delicious food have you\nprepared for tonight? Valentina smiled\nslightly and said, \"Tonight's main dish\nis brazed chicken with onions and\npotatoes. I wonder if you'd like it.\"\n\"He, I like whatever you do,\" Fongu said\nwith a smile. At that moment, Olivia\nappeared at the kitchen doorway and said\nto Valentina, \"Inside the kitchen,\nremember to add some chili to the\nchicken and onion stew, otherwise it\nwon't taste good.\" Valentina glared at\nOlivia at the kitchen doorway, but\nconsidering she needed to maintain her\nladylike image in front of Fongu, she\nforced a smile, nodded, and gritted her\nteeth, saying, \"Okay.\" Funu glanced at\nthe two odd-looking guys, raised an\neyebrow slightly, but said nothing. He\nturned, and walked towards the bathroom,\nsaying, \"I'm going to take a shower.\nWould you like Ryan to help you wash?\"\nValentina's voice came from the kitchen.\nHoly crap. No way. Fongu rushed into the\nbathroom and slammed the door shut. Was\nhe a complete virgin supposed to shower\nwith a girl with an amazing figure? That\nwould surely cause him to have a stroke.\nAfter Fongu left, Olivia glanced at\nValentina and said irritably, \"You're\nsuch a hypocritical little You\nknew perfectly well that master wouldn't\ndo that. Yet you still tried to provoke\nhim with your words. Who knows?\"\nValentina levitated a few chili peppers\nand a kitchen knife from magic. slowly\nchopped the chili peppers with a knife\nand threw them into the pot of stewed\nchicken with onions and potatoes and\nsaid, \"Ah, anyway, I've come to terms\nwith it. You and I have already sworn to\ndedicate everything to the owner of this\nhouse, so there's no need to be jealous\nof each other.\" Olivia snorted coldly\nwithout answering the question. \"What do\nyou think your master is not good enough\nfor you?\" Valentina said calmly.\nAlthough you were once the eldest\nprincess of the empire, the captain of\nthe Golden Lion Knights, and later\nbecame the ruler of the undead legion,\nin this room, the master is still the\nmost important person. You don't need to\nremind me of that. I just don't want\nthings to develop so quickly with\nmaster.\" As she said this, Olivia felt\nher cheeks getting slightly hot. But\nfortunately, the bandages on her face\nhadn't been removed yet, so she didn't\nhave to worry about being noticed.\nValentina said with a half smile. \"Oh\nho, so you don't want things to develop\ntoo quickly. I just remembered.\" Our\nrespected Imperial princess never had a\nsingle romance until her death. How\npure-hearted she was. Hearing\nValentina's sarcasm, Olivia retorted\ncoldly, \"Hump, I'm not like you, a\nwanted dark elf who has seduced\ncountless men.\" Without waiting for\nValentina's reply, Olivia walked away.\nAfter taking a shower, Fongu walked out\nof the bathroom feeling refreshed. He\nglanced at the dinner that had been\nprepared on the table and smiled\nslightly. As soon as I get home, there's\nhot water for a shower. And after I\nfinish, dinner is already prepared and\nserved. This is such a comfortable life.\nThat feels so damn good. After Fong Yu\nleft the bathroom, Olivia also came out\nof her room carrying the linen clothes\nFong Yu had made for her. and went into\nthe bathroom. She had fought a long\nbattle with the spiders today, and the\nbandages on her body were already soaked\nwith spider blood. She had to take a\nshower, but Fongu raised an eyebrow\nslightly. He seemed to see the magical\nblack silk stocking among the clothes\nOlivia was holding. Shaw, no, wait. It's\nsupposed to be called dark demon\nstockings. Sigh. Whatever. Whatever.\nOnly then did Fong Yu remember that the\ngiant spider's corpse and the boar\nlord's corpse in the wild boar forest\nhad not been dealt with. Just then,\nOlivia was about to take a bath. So Fong\nYu said to Valentina, \"Valentina, before\nit gets dark, come with me to the woods\nto the west. Two big guys and a lot of\nwild boars died there today, so you can\nprobably absorb a lot of soul power.\"\nValentina nodded. So Fongu took\nValentina out the door. This was his\nfirst time going out with the female\nghost. Fong Yu checked the system time.\nIt was 5:02 p.m. He should still have\nenough time to make a round trip. When\nFong Yu arrived at the wild boar\nterritory where the afternoon's battle\nhad taken place, all the surviving wild\nboores had already left, presumably\nhaving gone elsewhere, Fongu first went\nto the boar lord's corpse and used his\nbutchering skills to dissect it.\nRewards:\n180 wild boar meat, one strong lord's\nheart, one pig liver, four pig trotters,\n10 pig fat, eight wild boar hide, two\nbare mane fur, two hard and sharp tusks.\nStrong lord's heart. The reason why the\nwild boar lord can become the wild boar\nlord is because it has a strong heart.\nEating it will permanently increase the\nstrength attribute by one point.\nButchering skill proficiency 192 out of\n500. After 500 uses, it can be upgraded\nto advanced butchering skill. When Fong\nYu saw the description of the strong\nLord Pig heart, he was overjoyed. I\ncan't believe this thing can permanently\nincrease strength. It's amazing. Could\nit be that boss level monsters have a\nchance to drop materials that can\npermanently increase attributes? I\nwonder if that giant spider drops\nanything like that. Fong Yu then walked\nto the corpse of the human-faced demon\nspider. Looking at the huge spider\ncorpse, Fongu was somewhat emotional. He\nhad almost died at the hands of this guy\nseveral times, but in the end, he was\nthe one who killed it. Received 30\nspider meat, six sharp long claws, eight\nmagic spider skin for giant venomous\nfangs, one magic spider venom gland.\nDemon spider venom gland one contains an\nextremely potent neurotoxin that seals\nthe mouths of lower creatures upon\ncontact with blood and also has some\neffect on higher creatures such as\ndragons. It can be used to poison swords\nor arrows. Usage count 10 out of 10.\nButchering skill proficiency 193 out of\nto advanced butchering skill. Demon\nspider venom glands. Fongu was slightly\ndisappointed because it wasn't a\nmaterial that permanently increased\nattributes. But then he noticed the\ndescription in the game assistant that\nsaid it also has some effect on dragons.\nSo Funu raised an eyebrow, turned to\nlook south, and a strange smile appeared\non his lips. How about we take a trip to\nthat dragon's lair sometime? Chapter 1\n18. Golden treasure chest blue armor\nset. Ever since Fong Yu learned that\nthere was a dragon's lair not far to the\nsouth of his house, he had been plotting\nin his heart that when he had the\nstrength, he must go and kill that giant\ndragon. After all, how can one allow\nothers to sleep soundly beside one's\nbed? If only ordinary small monsters\ninhabit the area around the manor, Fongu\nwould naturally not care. However, if\nthere is something that threatens the\nsafety of the manor, Fongu will\nnaturally have to find a way to\neliminate that security threat. Now, the\nhuman-faced spider in the spider forest\nto the east, which had a grudge against\nhim, is dead. The boar lord in the boar\nforest to the west, which could threaten\nthe manor, is also dead. There is only a\nhaunted mine in the forest to the north,\nand it is full of his own people, so\nthere is nothing to worry about. The\nremaining area is the southern forest,\nwhich he has yet to enter. And beyond\nthe southern forest lies the dragon's\nlair. While Fong Yu was cleaning up the\ncorpses of the boar lord and the\nhuman-faced spider, Valentina was still\nwandering around absorbing the remaining\nsoul energy. Seeing that Valentina\nseemed to have some time left to\nrecover, Fong Yu began searching for the\nboar lord's lair. He remembered that\nAlpha had found a wooden treasure chest\nin the layer of an ordinary adult wild\nboar last time. So, if it was a wild\nboar lord, there should be an even\nhigher level treasure chest in the lair.\nBased on his memory of the midday nap,\nFong Yu found the location where the\nboar lord had been sleeping soundly.\nThere was an extremely thick giant tree\nthere, which was estimated to be too\nlarge for 20 or 30 people to encircle.\nBeneath the trunk of the giant tree was\na huge hollow filled with dry grass and\nbranches. If he was not mistaken, this\nshould be the boar lord's lair. After\nentering the nest, Fongu began using the\nsystem to collect the dry grass and\nbranches on the ground. received 189\nhay, 255 twigs. After the hay and\nbranches were cleared away, Fong Yu\nfinally spotted three treasure chests in\na corner of the pig's den. Two silver\ntreasure chests. There's one more golden\ntreasure chest. Good heavens. As\nexpected of a boss level boore lord,\nthere are actually three treasure\nchests. All of them containing gold and\nsilver. As usual, let's try our luck\nwith two silver treasure chests first.\nFong Yu rubbed his hands together and\nslowly opened the first silver treasure\nchest. Received one pig tooth horn\ncrafting blueprint. 15 pigkins boore\ntusk horn green exquisite a horn crafted\nfrom the tusks of a wild boar lord. When\nblown on a herd of wild boores, the herd\nwill follow you making it an excellent\ntool for raising wild boars. This is a\ngood thing. Funu laughed. Although he\ndidn't really need the pig tusk horn\nhimself, he could make it and sell it. A\nhorn that can command a herd of pigs is\nworth at least 100 pieces of meat. After\nall, with this horn, you can not only\nhunt wild boores without taking damage,\nbut also raise them. Anyone who isn't an\nidiot can tell the difference between a\nfull meal and a full meal every day.\nMoreover, Fongu had previously witnessed\nthe power of a charge by a group of wild\nboars, which even the two-story tall\ndemonic spider could not withstand. If\nwe could tame these wild boars, could we\nform a wild boar nightly order? Look at\nthose wild boares thick, oily skin and\nsharp tusks. Their fighting power is no\nless than that of warh horses. If you\nadd Olivia's resurrected zombie warrior\nas a knight, wouldn't that be even more\nawesome? Tsk tsk. This seems promising.\nHowever, how to raise and tame wild\nboores is a headache. Sigh. We'll see\nwhen the time comes. Fongu then opened\nthe second silver treasure chest.\nObtained skill book. Savage charge.\nSkill book. Savage charge after use.\nLocks onto a target within 30 m and\ncharges towards them, knocking them back\nor stunning them depending on their\nsize. The stun duration is 1 to 3\nseconds. Wearing a shield type weapon\ndoubles the stun effect. The exact\nduration depends on the targets\nresistance and can only be used if the\nfeet are not injured. Savage charge, a\nprerequisite skill for the berserker\nclass. Learning this skill unlocks the\nberserker class. Learning requirements,\nstrength 9, agility six, a vocational\nskills book, another good product. And\nthe word berserker sounds like a really\nawesome class. Putting everything else\naside, this skill alone is awesome. It\ncan lock onto targets within 30 m. Has\ndisplacement properties and also has\nsingle target control effects. Learn,\nlearn, learn now. Sorry, you cannot\nlearn this skill at the moment. Skill\nlearning requirements. Strength 9,\nagility six. Funu opened his attribute\npanel and took a look. Name: Fongu. Race\nhuman. Attribute version 0 to 10\n10.65,\nstrength 7.52,\nagility 5.73.\nAll three attributes have improved\nslightly, but I'm still 1.48 points\nshort of the required strength of 9.\nEven if I go back and eat the bore\nlord's heart that I just obtained, which\ncan permanently increase strength, I'll\nstill be 0.48 points short. Furthermore,\nhis agility is still 0.27 lower. Sorry\nto bother you, Fong. You closed the\nattribute panel and sideighed\nhelplessly. As expected, good skills and\njob prerequisites are quite high. When I\nget back, I'll check the exchange to see\nif anyone sells treasures that can\npermanently increase attributes. If not,\nI can try to buy them at a high price in\nthe chat channel. Why can't you think\nabout exercising more? Can't you stop\nbeing so lazy? Fong Yu then ignored the\ngame assistant's disappointed complaints\nand went to the last golden treasure\nchest, preparing to open it. This is the\nhighest level treasure chest he has ever\nencountered. Will be revealed. Fongu\nslowly lifted the lid of the treasure\nchest. Obtained fearless boar king set.\nBlue one fearless pig king set. Blue\nwearing this set reduces physical\ncontrol effects by 10% providing\nexcellent defense against physical\nattack weapons of lower quality. It's a\ncomplete set of blue grade armor. Fongu\nwas overjoyed. He had been wearing the\nwild boar armor for a long time. And\nalthough it was still sufficient,\nwouldn't it be better to have a higher\nlevel set of equipment? After collecting\nall the treasure chests and supplies,\nFongu left the boar lord's lair. At this\ntime, Valentina had also absorbed all\nthe soul energy in the area, and her\nsoul body was recondensed into a near\nphysical form. \"How are you feeling?\"\nFongu looked up at Valentina, who was\nfloating in midair. Valentina smiled\nslightly and said, \"That's great. Your\nstrength has improved a lot. From now\non, master can go out at night as long\nas he takes me with him.\" Going out at\nnight? Fongu remembered the game system,\nsaying that many strange monsters would\nappear at night in this survival world,\nand that venturing out recklessly would\neasily lead to being hunted by these\nmonsters lurking in the darkness.\nAlthough he hadn't encountered any of\nthose monsters yet, he figured they must\nbe incredibly powerful. To make Fong Yu\nrealize her current strength, Valentina\ngently waved her hand, and a huge\nphantom of a wild boar appeared in front\nof her, which was the appearance of the\ndead wild boar lord. Could this be the\nsoul of the boar lord? Then Valentino\nwaved her hand slightly, and the soul of\nthe human-faced spider appeared in front\nof Fong Yu. Holy crap. Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s\neyes widened in astonishment. You can\nenslave souls. Chapter 119. This goddess\nis really something. She has divine\npower. She truly gives. Yes, master. I\nhave enslaved these two undead.\nValentina explained. Enticing souls is a\nrequired course for necromancers,\nmaster. So, how strong are these guys in\ntheir soul state? This was the question\nFong Yu was most concerned about. If\nit's a simple soul attack, it will\ndamage the enemy's soul. But if you\nequip it with the soul weapon I made for\nyou last time, it can cause real damage\nto the enemy. Amazing. Fun. Any\nexclaimed, \"Directly damaging the soul\nis equivalent to real damage that\nignores armor.\" He suddenly realized a\nproblem. If Valentina's ability to\nenslave souls were combined with\nOlivia's ability to resurrect corpses,\nthen in the future, if a war broke out,\nfor every enemy that died on the other\nside, his side would gain two more\nallies. This is absolutely invincible.\nAt this point, Valentina added, \"But\nthese undead can only fight at night.\nThe sunlight during the day will quickly\ndissipate them. No wonder Valentina said\nthat from now on she can go out at night\nas long as she takes her with her. Then\nwhy don't you just enslave more? Fong Yu\npointed to the wild boar carcasses\naround them and said, \"Enslave their\nsouls, too. Enslaving souls is not a\nsimple matter, master.\" Valentina\nexplained. To maintain the integrity of\nthese souls, I need to constantly supply\nthem with soul energy. Therefore, unless\na soul is extremely valuable, it is\ngenerally not worth my enslavement. The\nsouls of the weak are only fit to be\nabsorbed by me and become my soul power.\nWhy does that sound like it sends a\nchill down your spine? Fu raised an\neyebrow slightly, sensing that Valentino\nwasn't as harmless as she appeared on\nthe surface. But soon, Valentina seemed\nto realize that there was something\nwrong with what she had just said. So,\nshe quickly explained, \"Don't worry,\nmaster. I won't kill on my own. I will\nonly absorb and enslave the souls of\nthose who have already died. After\nhearing Valentina's explanation, Fongu\nlaughed and said, \"He, I don't oppose\nkilling. As long as it's not\nindiscriminate killing of innocent\npeople, I can accept it.\" Soon, Fong Yu\nand Valentino returned to the cabin.\nOlivia and Alfa were already sitting at\nthe table, waiting for Fongu to come\nback and start the meal. After dinner,\nFong Yu prepared to upgrade the manor,\nbut when he saw the upgrade\nrequirements, he immediately slapped his\nforehead. Damn it, I forgot about 10\nstone tablets again. Left with no other\nchoice, Fongu had to go out again and\nreturned to Yorktown to find a cemetery.\nThis time, he didn't alert anyone or\ninform Song Jimming. Instead, he quietly\nled Olivia to a small hill about 200 m\nnorth of Yorktown. After all, digging up\ngraves wasn't exactly a respectable\nthing. And he wouldn't know how to\nanswer if someone asked. Even if you\ntell people that you're using a\ntombstone to upgrade your house, what\nkind of house upgrade system requires a\ntombstone? In short, I cannot go into\ndetails. On the mound stood a\ndilapitated building, which according to\nOlivia was the church of the dark\nchurch. The dark church serving the dark\ngod. This was the first time Fongu had\never heard of such an organization.\nOlivia nodded and said, \"Once, the dark\nchurch was a force that could rival the\nlight church. But unfortunately, during\nthis 10,000-year wager, the power of the\ndark god gradually declined, and the\ndark church also disintegrated under the\nsuppression of the light church.\" Fongu\nremained silent. He had actually guessed\nthis situation. So, this used to be the\nterritory of the dark church. Funu\nasked. Olivia nodded and said, \"This\nisland of divine punishment was\noriginally called the island of\ndarkness. Legend has it that it was the\nplace where the dark god first descended\nto earth and the location of the dark\ntemple. Now, however, it has become an\nabandoned place for exiling sinners. I\nsee. However, this is actually quite\ngood. Without the suppression of the\nlocals, these players from another world\ncan develop in peace.\" Soon the two\narrived at the foot of the hill. Fongu\nglanced at the cemetery on the dark\nhillside. It was fairly well organized\nwith about a 100 tombstones. As Fongu\nwas pondering which tin tombstones to\ndig up, suddenly the hairs on his body\nstood on end. He realized there was\ndanger. Sure enough, Olivia also took\nthe iron axe in her hand and said,\n\"Master, there are spirits hidden in\nthis graveyard. We need to be careful.\"\nFonu glanced at Olivia and felt\nrelieved. With her there, his safety\nshould be fine. So he asked curiously,\n\"You mean undead? Are they also undead\ncreatures?\" Olivia shook her head and\nsaid, \"The undead and the undead are\nlike two sides of the same coin. They\nexist by absorbing death energy, while\nthe undead exist by absorbing life\nenergy.\" Olivia's explanation was like a\nwise saying to Fong Yu, a complete\nnovice. It was more insightful than any\nlecture. I barely understood it. In\nshort, the undead and the undead are not\nthe same thing. Can you defeat the\nundead hiding inside? Funu asked again.\nTombstones are essential for upgrading\nhouses, and he didn't want to leave\nempty-handed. However, if there were\ntruly undead spirits in this cemetery\nthat they couldn't defeat, then they\nwould have no choice but to retreat and\nthink of another way. After a moment's\nthought, Olivia replied, \"The undead are\nspirits, so my attacks are mainly\nphysical.\" Valentina is better at\ndealing with spirits. But the undead\naren't actually that scary. \"As long as\nyou don't disturb their slumber, they\nusually won't come out. If we dig up the\ntombstones, wouldn't that disturb their\npeaceful rest?\" Funu asked. Olivia gave\nFong Yu a silent look. What do you\nthink? Tsk tsk sigh. Fongu sighed\nhelplessly. He was about to go back and\nbring Valentina over that evening when a\nbrilliant idea suddenly flashed into his\nmind, etc. If there are no bodies in the\ngraves, then digging up the tombstones\nin those empty graves shouldn't attract\nthe attention of the dead, right? There\nwere exactly 10 miners in the haunted\nmine. They all died there, and Steve\npersonally collected their remains.\nTheir families will probably build a\nsenotap for them, right? 10 senotaps\nshould be just right. So Fong Yu took\nOlivia and wandered around the cemetery,\nstarting to look for the scenotaps of\nSteve and the others. There weren't many\ntombstones, only a little over a\nhundred. In just 2 minutes, Fong Yu\nspotted Steve's and the others\ntombstones in a corner of the cemetery.\nAfter Olivia confirmed that the 10\ngraves gathered together were indeed\nsinotaps for Steve and his companions,\nFong no longer hesitated and began\ncollecting their tombstones one by one.\nHaving a game system by your side is\nultimately quite comfortable. Collecting\ntombstones is exceptionally easy.\nThey're gone with a single touch. Fongu\ndidn't even need to use the pickaxe he\nbrought. After collecting all 10\ntombstones, Fong Yu and Olivia left the\ncemetery and prepared to return to the\nmanor. Just then, Olivia suddenly\nstopped, turned around, and looked at\nthe cemetery behind her, frowning.\nWhat's wrong? Funu asked curiously.\nOlivia replied. I sensed a powerful and\nmalevolent force watching us just now.\nUpon hearing the powerful and evil\nthought, Fong Yu felt a chill run down\nhis spine because the last time Olivia\nmentioned a powerful enemy was the\ntwo-story tall human-faced spider. This\nalso means that a boss level monster is\nhidden in this cemetery. Moreover, his\nactions had already alerted the other\nparty, so he said without hesitation,\n\"Retreat. Go back immediately.\" The two\nquickly headed away into the distance.\nAt the same time, a blurry ghostly\nfigure appeared at the entrance of the\ndilapidated church at top the hill, its\neyes glowing with a scarlet light. Those\ncrimson eyes stared at the departing\nfigures of Fong Yu and Olivia, filled\nwith venomous resentment. Then his\ncrimson gaze turned to Yorktown, which\nwas not far away. A low, eerie, and\nsinister laugh echoed through the\nchurch. My flesh and soul are all mine.\nUnder Olivia's protection, Fongu\nreturned safely to the manor and then he\ncouldn't wait to open the house upgrade\ninterface. Haunted manor one star. Three\none bathroom, one yard, 100sqm interior,\n100sqm yard. Haunted manor twoar, three\none bathroom, one yard. 130s sqm\ninterior 200s sqqm yard upgrade\nrequirements with 76795/3000\nmud 4500/500\nbones 1550\nspecial items giant beast remains 1\ntombstone 10/10 magic crystal 109/10\nupgradeable. Finally, all conditions\nhave been met. Fong Yu filled with\nexcitement chose to upgrade. As the\nfamiliar shaking began, the house\nstarted to upgrade. However, Fongu\nnoticed that the shaking was not\nsignificant this time, and it was mainly\nconcentrated on the floor beneath his\nfeet. One minute later, the shaking\nstopped, and the house as a whole did\nnot change much, except that a staircase\nleading to the underground had appeared\non the floor in the corner of the living\nroom. Haunted Manner 2 star upgrade\ncomplete unlocked. Monster Hut: Undead\nGraveyard 10. Undead basement level 1\n30SQM.\nMonster Hut can be used to house various\npets or monsters currently at 1/3\ncapacity can be upgraded separately.\nUndead graveyard can be used to store\ncorpses, allowing them to be resurrected\nand become undead. Current capacity 0/10\nrest in peace. A special necroantic\ncan be upgraded individually. After\nreading the assistance instructions,\nFunu fell into deep thought. The monster\nhouse is essentially a house built for\npets. Currently, the one spot occupied\nshould belong to little spider cherry\nblossom, but we'll leave that aside for\nnow. The important things are the undead\ngraveyard and the undead basement.\nLiterally speaking, the undead graveyard\nshould be related to Olivia, while the\nunderground of the dead should be\nrelated to Valentina. So, Fong, you\nasked the two of them. The corpses I\nresurrected were merely walking corpses,\nalmost devoid of consciousness, only\ncapable of performing simple tasks,\nOlivia said. But the corpses resurrected\nfrom the undead graveyard can maintain\ntheir sanity just like me and are true\nundead. Valentina also explained, \"The\nsouls I enslave are puppets who have\nlost their own will and have no\nintelligence. If you want to take in\nsome self-aware souls as servants, you\ncan let them live in this basement. Then\nhow do I subdue those souls? Fong Yu\nasked curiously. Follow me. Valentina\nfloated down the stairs from the corner\nof the living room to the basement and\nFongu followed her down the stairs to\nthe basement. In the center of the\nbasement stood a stone pillar engraved\nwith mysterious inscriptions. In laid\nbetween the inscriptions were 10 magic\ncrystals that shimmerred with a pale\npurple light, and a ring was placed on\ntop of the pillar. Valentina floated to\nthe stone pillar and pointed to the\nring, saying, \"As long as you wear this\nring, you can subdue the undead. Once\nyou successfully subdue the undead, it\nwill automatically sign a master servant\ncontract with you.\" Fongu picked up the\nseemingly ordinary black ring and put it\non the middle finger of his left hand.\nYou have equipped the elegy of the\nundead, red artifact. This ring allows\nyou to forcibly enslave undead with a\nlower spiritual level than yourself or\nhas a certain probability of enslaving\nundead with a higher spiritual level.\nThe success rate depends on the\ndifference in spiritual level between\nthe target soul and the ring holder.\nCurrent enslavement limit 0/10.\nWearing this ring grants the holder\nimmunity to soul enslavement skills and\nprotection against soul-based skill\ndamage below the level of gods. this.\nFunu gasped, somewhat shocked. Who would\nhave thought this ring was actually a\nmagical artifact? Judging from the\nattribute description, it can actually\nwithstand soul type skill damage below\nthe level of a god. No wonder it's a\ndivine artifact. With this thing, can we\ngo and slay that dragon in the south?\nFunu asked. Valentina was slightly\ntakenback upon hearing this, then\ncovered her mouth and chuckled. master.\nThis artifact is extremely effective\nagainst souls, but it doesn't pose much\nof a threat to creatures with powerful\nbodies like dragons. Moreover, dragons\nprimarily attack with physical strikes\nand dragon fire, and the elegy of the\nsoul cannot exempt them from these\ndamages. That makes sense. Fongu\nsuddenly realized that everyone has\ntheir own expertise and even divine\nartifacts are not omnipotent. Even so,\nhaving this divine ring means that he\ncan ignore mental and soul magic for a\nlong time to come. Wow. It feels like\nthere's another layer of protection for\nmy life. So comfortable. Fong Yu then\nreturned to the ground, took the torch,\nand went outside to see if anything else\nhad appeared in the manor. Sure enough,\nhe soon saw a house on the south side of\nthe manor with the skeleton of a giant\nspider with demonic patterns as its main\nstructure. because its main structure is\nbased on a spider skeleton covered with\na layer of wooden planks. The monster\nhunt looks like a giant spider crawling\nin the yard from a distance, which is a\nbit scary. But fortunately, Fong Yu is\nnaturally very brave, and after living\nwith his ghostly companions in the hut\nfor a few days, he doesn't care about it\nanymore. He even went inside the monster\nhouse and accessed its information\npanel. Monster Hunt. Dark. Built\nprimarily from the skeleton of a giant\nspider with magic patterns. It possesses\ninherent dark attributes. Pets kept here\nhave a chance to learn dark attribute\ntalents by observing the magic patterns\non the spider skeleton, increasing their\ngrowth rate by 20%. Funu raised an\neyebrow slightly after reading the\ninformation panel. He recalled the\nbattle between the pig spider and the\nhuman-faced spider, which had\nsingle-handedly fought against the\nentire herd of wild boars because it\npossessed magic. In particular, the\nshadow fluctuations that rippled\noutwards like waves instantly corroded\nthe flesh of any wild boores they\ntouched. Even Alpha, who had demon\nblood, had a layer of skin and flesh\ncorroded away, demonstrating its\nterrifying power. Just a few days ago,\nthat human-faced spider was merely a\nhighly venomous spider the size of a\nmillstone. How did it grow from the size\nof a millstone to a giant spider over 3\nm tall in just a few days? Recalling how\nthe human-faced spider had chased after\nhim relentlessly after he stole the\nremains of the demon spider. And\nconsidering what was mentioned in the\nMonster Hut information panel, Fong Yu\ncouldn't help but have a guess. It is\nhighly likely that the human-faced demon\nspider evolved by comprehending the\ndemonic runes on the remains of the\ndemonic giant spider. Since that's the\ncase, that little cherry blossom isn't.\nThinking of this, Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s lips\ncurled up, he immediately went back into\nthe house, carried little Sakura to the\nmonster house, and told her that she\nwould live in the monster house from now\non. Little Sakura seemed a little\nreluctant to part with Fong Yu. But\nafter crawling around the hut, it was\nquickly attracted by the aura emanating\nfrom the remains of the demon spider and\neventually stayed in the monster hut.\nLooking at the pink and tender body of\nthe cherry blossom, Fong Yu smiled\nhelplessly. He didn't expect Sakura to\nevolve into a powerful giant beast. He\nonly hoped that it would have some\nability to protect itself. Finally,\nFongu arrived at the open space north of\nthe wooden house. There were two rows of\nneat tombstones there. The original\ninscriptions on them had been erased,\nand behind each tombstone was a dug pit\ncontaining a wooden coffin. If you put a\ncorpse in a coffin and bury it, will the\ncorpse become an undead? Fu asked Olivia\nbeside him. Olivia nodded. Why is that?\nWhat's the principle behind it? Fongu\nwas very curious. Olivia raised her\nfinger and pointed to the center of the\ncemetery, saying, \"Look there.\" Fongu\nlooked in the direction Olivia pointed\nand then discovered that there was a\nstrange black stone statue more than 2 m\ntall standing in the center of the\ncemetery. Because it was already dark,\nhe had not noticed the statue that\nblended into the darkness. This is a\nstatue of hell, the goddess of death.\nShe is also the goddess of life who\ngoverns the laws of life and death.\nThose who believe in her will gain the\npower to control life and death and\nbecome undead. Just by believing in her,\nyou can gain the power to control life\nand death. Fongu raised an eyebrow upon\nhearing this, looking at the statue with\nadmiration and said, \"It seems this\ngoddess Hera is truly capable. She\nreally does grant divine power.\" Chapter\n120. Undead insect swarm siege.\nThroughout history, immortality has been\na desire that almost everyone has longed\nfor. Even the greatest emperors of all\ntime could not resist the temptation of\neternal life. But in Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s\nworld, he had never heard of anyone\nsucceeding. But in this world, as long\nas you believe in a god, you can obtain\nthis coveted immortality. How can this\nnot drive people crazy? Putting\neverything else aside, even Fong Yu\ncouldn't resist wanting to run up to the\nstatue and pay his respects. But Olivia\nstopped him and explained, \"Although the\nundead have gained immortality, their\nsouls are also imprisoned within their\nbodies, preventing them from going to\nthe realm of the gods and even depriving\nthem of the right to go to hell.\" \"Isn't\nthat great?\" Funu laughed. \"I don't\nconsider myself a good person, so\nthere's no way I'll go to that god's\nkingdom after I die. Becoming an undead\nperson will save me from the torments of\nhell. It's double the happiness. At this\nmoment, Olivia added, \"Becoming an\nundead will mean losing the ability to\nreproduce.\" As she said this, her\nexpression dimmed slightly, and her eyes\nshowed a hint of disappointment. Upon\nhearing that becoming an undead would\nmean losing the ability to reproduce.\nFunu decisively withdrew from his path\ntowards the statue. After all, he wasn't\none to choose not to have children. If\nthe opportunity arose and he could\nestablish himself in this world, he\nstill wanted to start his own family and\nhave children. Perhaps when he's in his\n70s or 80s and his life is fulfilling,\nif he still desires immortality, he can\nexploit that bug again. Just as Fong Yu\nand Olivia were studying the undead\ncemetery, a chilling wind began to blow\nthrough the cemetery on the hill next to\nYorktown. It was already dark when an\neerie green light suddenly emanated from\nthe dilapidated church at top the hill.\nSuddenly, a withered grayish white hand\nreached out from the shadows at the\nchurch entrance and grabbed a modeled\nstone pillar. Then, a desiccated corpse,\nleaning on a staff that shimmerred with\ndark green light, walked out of the\nchurch entrance. The mummified corpse\nlooked down at its mangled body under\nthe starlight and gave a slight grin. It\nseems it's time to get a new body. Then\nthe mummified corpse looked up at the\nbrightly lit Yorktown in the distance,\nwhich was being rebuilt, and laughed.\nThe mummified corpse, which was missing\nhalf of its face and had half of its\nteeth showing, had laughed. He So many\nbodies, so many souls. The mummified\ncorpse waved its staff, and a beam of\ngreen light shot out from the tip of the\nstaff and disappeared into the cemetery\non the hillside in front of the church.\nAwaken my children. As the mummified\ncorpse uttered its chanting like words,\nthe soil in the cemetery began to\ntremble slightly. Soon, palmsized jet\nblack beetles emerged from the soil,\nemitting hissing sounds. looking at the\nblack beetles covering the hillside. The\nmummified corpse revealed another eerie\nsmile, pointed its staff in the\ndirection of Yorktown, and said, \"Go\nspread your plague and let the undead\nscourge descend upon this world once\nmore.\" As soon as the words were spoken,\nthousands of black beetles surged toward\nYorktown like a tidal wave. At this\nmoment, Fongu brought Olivia back to the\nhouse. The manor has now been upgraded,\nand the three additional facilities\nclearly show that the manor's style is\nunmistakably dark and gloomy. Fonu felt\nsomewhat helpless about this, but he\nwasn't entirely opposed to it. After\nall, as a writer of supernatural novels,\nhe was quite accepting of this eerie\nstyle. After finishing everything for\nthe time being, Funu began to take stock\nof the supplies he had recently\nacquired, especially the lifewood core\nhe obtained after killing the trant in\nthe spider forest, which the system\ndescribed as an excellent material for\nmaking magic wands. What he needs most\nright now is a handy staff. After all,\nas a mage, even if he is only a\nlow-level mage, it's not good to always\ncast spells with bare hands. At least,\nit doesn't look very impressive. So Fong\nYu immediately took out the Lifewood\ncore and began studying it at the\nenchanting table to see what kind of\nwand he could make. But looking at it\nfrom all angles, it seems that with his\ncurrent level as a low-level mage, he\ncan only make bluegrade elemental wands.\nThe key point is that he doesn't even\nhave a blueprint. What a load of\nrubbish. Fortunately, he still has a\ncheat code. Valentina Fongu smiled at\nthe female ghost and said, \"Can you make\nme a staff?\" As he spoke, he handed the\ncore of the wood of life in his hand to\nValentina. Use this material. Of course,\nno problem. Valentina smiled and used\nher mental power to take the core of the\nwood of life. She looked at it and\nasked, \"You also killed a trant today.\nIt wasn't me.\" Fu shook his head, looked\nat Olivia, and smiled. It's mainly\nthanks to Olivia. I'm just a support at\nbest. Valentina glanced at Olivia, who\nwas smuggly sharpening her iron axe and\nimmediately pouted, saying agrevedly.\n\"Ryan is so lucky to be able to fight\nalongside his master while I can only\nstay inside.\" \"Uh\" Fongu scratched his\nhead, unsure how to respond to\nValentina's question. \"Olivia, without\neven looking up, said, \"Master, Ignore\nher. She just loves to make a scene.\"\nAdding more scenes. Fu raised an eyebrow\nslightly. Why add more drama? What does\nit mean? Why is it that I can understand\nless and less of what they're saying?\nValentina glared at Olivia angrily, then\nplaced the core of the wood of life into\nthe enchanting table and said, \"Don't\nworry, master. I will definitely make\nyou the best wand.\" After she finished\nspeaking, a powerful surge of magical\nenergy emanated from Valentina and\nflowed into the enchanting table,\nwhereupon Valentina began crafting the\nwand. Fongu approached the enchanting\ntable to try and observe Valentina's\nwand making process, but as before, he\ngave up after watching for 3 minutes. He\nwas completely confused by the very\nbeginning of using magic to decompose\nthe core of the wood of life and\nseparate it into individual wood fibers.\nSo, he gave up trying to figure it out\nand took out the book of evil gods from\nthe cabinet in the living room. It was\nfeeding time again. As soon as Fong Yu\nopened the six-pointed star seal on the\nbook of evil gods, the strange book\nopened its mouth and began to wail\nloudly, begging for food. If it weren't\nfor the eyeball on the cover catching a\nglimpse of Olivia sitting to the side,\nsharpening her ax, it probably would\nhave jumped up and chased after Fongu to\nbite him. Fongu brought out food\nspecially prepared for the strange book\nfrom the kitchen, Mexicanstyle roasted\npig's head and human flesh. The method\nfor making this thing is very simple.\nJust skewer stacks of meat on a branch\nand roast them over a campfire. When\nthey are almost done, use a dagger to\ncut them into small pieces and put them\non a plate. Funu himself doesn't eat\nthis stuff. It's made entirely for alpha\nand the strange book. Don't vomit any\nweird stuff today, Fong Yu said, staring\nat the strange book. Vomit something\nusable or I'll feed you tree branches\ntomorrow. The strange book rolled its\neyes at Fong Yu, then jumped in front of\nthe barbecue and started tearing into\nit. After a while, the book of evil\ngods, having devoured a huge chunk of\nroasted pigs head and human flesh,\nfinally spat out a massive multifaceted\ncrystal, which then returned to its\nnormal spellbook form. Fonu looked down\nat the blue crystal on the table, which\nwas about the size of a watermelon, and\nwaited for the game assistant to give\nhim a hint. Wind element essence. Blue\nwind is a relatively rare and special\nelement. Generally, only crystals high\nin the mountains have the opportunity to\ncapture wind and nurture it into wind\nelement crystals. Wind element essence\nis formed from wind element crystals\nthat have been nurtured for over a\nhundred years. Professional mages can\nprobe into it with their spiritual power\nto sense the power of wind and unlock\nwind element magic. Phew, this works.\nFunu laughed. Although his best skill\nright now is the fire magic fireball, he\nhas long coveted wind magic. As everyone\nknows, if a mage wants to fly, he either\nhas to learn from a druid and become a\nbird or he has to find a flying broom.\nBut those methods are too ugly. The\ncoolest way is to use wind elemental\nmagic to gain the ability to fly. For\nFong Yu, the most important factor in\nlearning magic is being cool is all that\nmatters. So taking advantage of the\nearly hour, Fong Yu used his spiritual\npower to penetrate the wind elemental\nessence and sensed the wind elemental\npower within it. After a long time, Fong\nYu opened his eyes, his brows furrowing.\nHe discovered that this wind element\nwasn't actually a specific element, but\nrather more like a state, a state of air\nmovement. Understanding the element of\nwind is essentially understanding the\ndynamic state of air flow and friction.\nFor example, accelerating a stream of\nair to impact an object in an instant is\ncalled a wind wave. If the speed of this\nair flow is further increased and its\ncross-section is compressed, making the\nangle at which it impacts the object\nsharper and achieving the purpose of\ncutting, then that is the blade of wind.\nTherefore, it can be deduced that\nwind-based aerial magic actually uses\nthe air flow around the body to propel\nthe body, thereby achieving the purpose\nof flying. Congratulations. You have\nsuccessfully grasped the element of\nwind, unlocked wind magic, and can now\nindependently comprehend the spells wind\nwave, wind blade, and wind dance. Huh?\nYou figured it out so easily. What you\nperceive as simple is due to your modern\neducation. For a native of this world,\ncomprehending these techniques would be\nextremely difficult. Moreover, this is\nmerely introductory level magic, which\nis inherently not very challenging. I\nsee. But I received a science education\nbefore. So why is it useful in this\nmagical world? Science and magic are\nsimply different ways of observing the\nworld. They are not inherently\ncontradictory. Both built upon the\nunderlying rules of this world, just\nfollowing different paths. A single\nconversation with you is worth more than\na single talk. Wind pulse consumes five\nmana points per minute. Controls a gust\nof air for short distance movement. Can\nimpact or lift objects. Windb Blade\nconsumes 20 mana points, injecting a\nlarge amount of mana into the airflow\nand compressing the air into a bladelike\nform, increasing its movement speed and\nallowing it to pierce or cut the target,\ndealing considerable damage and being\ndifficult to detect. Dance of the Wind\nconsumes 10 mana points per minute,\nallowing you to ride the surrounding air\ncurrents to lift your body for\nlowaltitude flight. H why can we only\nfly at low altitudes? Because the high\naltitude air currents are too powerful\nfor your current skill level to handle,\nyou would fall to your death. However,\nat that moment, the system interface\nbegan sending a series of message\nprompts. Fongu frowned, sensing that\nsomething bad was about to happen. Sure\nenough, when he opened the chat channel,\nhe saw a message from Song Jaming. Boss,\nwe're under attack. Requesting backup.\nBoss, come quick. We can't hold out much\nlonger. Damn it. Another attack. Fong Yu\nimmediately asked, \"What attacked you\nthis time? Why did you suddenly become\nunable to hold on?\" Song Jimming replied\nto the message shortly after. \"They're\ninsects. Countless black beetles.\nThousands upon thousands. Black beetles.\nThousands upon thousands of them.\" Fong\nYu raised his eyebrows, not\nunderstanding why so many insects had\nsuddenly appeared and were even\nattacking the city. But since Sanjiing\nhad already asked for help, it meant the\nsituation was not optimistic. Fong\nreplied, \"Hold on, I'm coming right\naway.\" and prepared to go and provide\nsupport. He had conquered this town and\ngathered the people there. They were all\nplayers who intended to follow him. So,\nit was only right that he provide\nsupport. Of course, just to be on the\nsafe side, he also brought Valentina and\nOlivia along. He had personally\nwitnessed Olivia, still in her skeletal\nform, slaughtering the spiders when they\nattacked the cabin last time. And\nValentina's magic seemed quite suitable\nfor dealing with these numerous small\ninsects. Because of the urgency of the\nsituation, they did not choose to walk.\nInstead, Valentina used wind pulse to\ncarry Fong Yu and Olivia at low altitude\ntowards the town. In less than 3\nminutes, Fong Yu and his group flew to\nthe outskirts of the city. Before they\neven landed, Fong Yu saw many players\nfleeing towards the city. Fun Yu ignored\nthe players who were trying to escape\nand instead had Valentina fly him and\nOlivia directly into Yorktown. After\nflying over the city wall, Fong Yu saw\nthat fires were breaking out all over\nthe city. In the light of the fires,\nFong Yu discovered that the players were\nretreating south of the town. It seems\nthose insects came from the north. After\nscanning the area again, Fong Yu finally\nfound Song Jumming, who was holding a\ntorch in one hand and an iron sword in\nthe other. Song Jimming was accompanied\nby more than a dozen other players who\nwere also armed. They were standing on\nthe roof of a two-story building in the\ncenter of the town, wielding their iron\nswords and slashing at the black beetles\nthat were climbing up the walls.\nHowever, judging from the number of\nbeetles crawling out of the ground like\na tide, they probably won't last long.\nFong Yu then pointed to the rooftop\nwhere Song Jimming and the others had\nbrought and said, \"Go there and help\nthem.\" Valentina nodded and swooped down\nwith Fong Yu and Olivia. At this moment\non the rooftop, Song Jumming was\nstruggling to slash at the black beetles\ntrying to pounce on him with his iron\nsword. Although his sword wielding\naccuracy was not very good, there were\njust too many insects at his feet.\nAlmost every time he slashed, he could\nhit one or two beetles, splashing out\ngushing gushes of disgusting black pus.\n\"Brother Song,\" when his boss Fong Yu\nfinally arriving. \"We're really about to\ncollapse,\" a male player next to him\nasked anxiously. After swatting away a\nbeetle that tried to pounce on his face\nwith his torch, Song Jimming replied\nbreathlessly, \"It won't be that fast.\nIt'll take the boss time to get here,\ntoo. Hang in there. I can't hold on any\nlonger.\" A young player who was\nnoticeably thinner was so tired that he\ncould no longer swing his weapon.\nInsects had started crawling up his\ntrouser leg. He cried out anxiously,\n\"Damn it, don't bite my balls. Get\nlost!\" or frantically swatted at the\nbeetles that were crawling up his\ntrouser leg. Song Jimming sighed\ninwardly, guessing that he was probably\ndoomed this time. Who would have thought\nthat so many insects would suddenly\nattack the city in the middle of the\nnight? The newly repaired city wall was\ncompletely useless to these insects and\nunder the cover of darkness. They were\nas invisible as if they were invisible.\nThe guards on the outposts did not\nnotice them at all until the insects\nclimbed up the city wall and attacked\nthe guards on the wall. However, it was\ntoo late. The guards long swords and\narrows were no match for these palmsized\ninsects. In less than 2 minutes, the\ninsects broke through the city wall and\nentered the city. This was also the time\nwhen Sanjimming had just received news\nthat the town had been attacked. If they\nhad evacuated in time, they might have\nbeen able to escape. But Song Jimming\ncouldn't bear to leave this newly\nestablished settlement. And since it was\nnighttime, leaving the town for the\nwilderness would also mean facing\nunknown dangers. So, he chose to stay in\nthe main building and wait for Fong Yu's\nsupport. However, judging from the\nsituation, I'm afraid I won't be able to\nwait for Fong Yu's support. Just as the\npeople on the rooftop were about to be\noverwhelmed by the horde of black\nbeetles, a strong wind suddenly came\nfrom above. By the time they reacted,\nthey saw a dark shadow land beside them,\nfollowed by a dark green lion shadow\nthat roared to the sky. Roar! With a\nroar from the lion's shadow, the beetles\non everyone's bodies fell off and\nscattered in all directions. Watching\nthe green lion shadow slowly disappear.\nSong Jimming felt a strong sense of\nfamiliarity. He vaguely remembered that\nwhen boss Fong Yu escorted him home, the\nfemale warrior servant had used this\nmove before. Could it be? Song Jimming\nlooked at the dark figure. Sure enough,\nit was Olivia carrying an iron axe.\nAmazingly, the moment Olivia stood\nthere, the black beetles around her\nwould swerve away as if they had seen a\nnatural enemy, not daring to come any\ncloser to her. \"Great, we're&lt;unk&gt;\nsaved,\" Song Jimming exclaimed\nexcitedly. \"Boss Fong Yu is here.\" \"Huh?\nWhere is Boss Fong Yu?\" \"Boss Fong Yu,\nthe one with the axe. Wait a minute.\nThat's a woman.\" Because she arrived in\na hurry, Olivia did not wrap her face\nand hair with bandages. Holy crap, that\ngirl is gorgeous. Her figure is\nabsolutely perfect. Her side profile is\nstunning. What time is it? You still\nhave the mind to admire girls? Holy\ncrap, those breasts. That's cheating.\nIt's not just her chest. Look how long\nthose legs are. They almost touch my\nchest. Wow, those golden waves. So\nstylish. At this moment, Olivia turned\naround and glanced at the group of\npeople indifferently. Holy crap. She\nlooked at me. My heart is pounding. My\ngod, she looks unreal. Those huge,\nbeautiful eyes. I can't take it. Song\nJimming couldn't listen anymore. He knew\nOlivia all too well. Although she was\nincredibly beautiful, she was also very\nwilling to help people reincarnate, and\nshe wouldn't even blink an eye when it\ncame to killing. Most importantly, they\nare a powerful swordsman who can easily\ndefeat these novice players. Song\nJimming was genuinely afraid that the\nfemale swordsmen might in a fit of anger\nuse her ax to send these leerous\nbastards to their deaths. So Song\nJumming immediately shouted at the\nexcited male players. Shut the hell up\nif you don't want to die. Upon hearing\nthis, one of the male players retorted\nwith dissatisfaction, \"What's wrong?\nCan't I even say what I want?\" Song\nJimming sneered. Do you know who she is?\nUpon hearing this, the male player\nimmediately became interested and asked,\n\"You know her? Is she also a female\nplayer who just arrived here?\" Song\nJimming shook his head and said, \"That's\nboss Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;'s servant.\" Servants.\nThe male players all looked surprised.\n\"Holy crap, how did Fong Yu manage to\ntame such a beautiful and dashing\nservant? I wish I could have such a\nbeautiful maid as my servant.\" Seeing\nthat they still didn't back down, Song\nJimming gritted his teeth and said,\n\"She's not only beautiful and cool, but\nalso a sword master.\" Upon hearing this,\nthe restless male gamers around him were\nall stunned. \"What did you say?\" a male\nplayer exclaimed in surprise. A\nswordsman level expert. \"You're not\nkidding, are you? Those who stayed\nbehind all had professions, most of them\nwarriors, but they were all low-level\nwarriors. They were still two major\nlevels away from swordsmen, intermediate\nand advanced warriors. You should know\nthat an intermediate level warrior can\neasily take on three or four low-level\nwarriors. And an advanced level warrior\ncan take on more than a dozen low-level\nwarriors. So, how many low-level\nwarriors can a swordsman crush? Nobody\nknows, let alone swordsmen. The highest\nlevel of warrior players we know of is\nonly intermediate warrior. Therefore,\nthese people clearly did not believe\nJimming&lt;unk&gt;s claim that Fong Yu had\nsubdued a powerful female swordsman as a\nservant. Old Song, stop bragging.\nAlthough I know Fong Yu is very\npowerful, I would believe you if you\nsaid this blonde girl was Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s\nservant, but to say she's a swordsman is\na bit much, a male player said. Someone\nnearby chimed in. Exactly. Do you think\nwe're fools? All right, whether it's\ntrue or not, we'll find out by going\nover and asking. Hey, hey, hey. Let me\nask you. No, no, no. Let me do it. Let\nme do it. Huh? You perverted Joe. Were\nyou just trying to get answers? I'm too\nembarrassed to call you out on it. As\nthey were talking, several male players\nnoisily surrounded Olivia. Looking at\nthe male players with excited\nexpressions, Sanjming shook his head\nhelplessly inside. Since you insist on\ncourting death, don't say I didn't stop\nyou later. Just as Song Jumming was\nspeaking, the swarm of black beetles on\nall four sides of the eaves seemed to\nreceive some signal, overcame their fear\nof Olivia, and surrounded the people on\nthe roof. Olivia's gaze sharpened, and\nshe leaped into the air, raising her\niron ax to strike down on a swarm of\ninsects. Boom! The iron axe slammed into\nthe floor, unleashing a fan-shaped\nshockwave of battle aura that\nannihilated most of the swarm of\ninsects, while the rest were blown away.\n\"This scene completely terrified the\nmale players.\" \"This this seems to be\nthe ground slash skill that only\nadvanced warriors can unlock,\" a warrior\nplayer exclaimed in surprise. However,\nanother warrior player said, \"You're\nwrong. Ground slash can't be projected\nwith battle aura. That's a vortex slash\nthat only swordsmen can unleash. Holy\ncrap. So, she really is a swordsman. As\nshe spoke, Olivia moved the iron axe to\nher other hand and swung it across the\nother side of the building. Whoosh! A\ncrescent-shaped burst of battle aura\nshot out from the ax blade, slicing\nthrough the oncoming swarm of insects.\nHowever, the swarms of insects from the\nother two sides had already rushed in\nfront of everyone. Olivia supported\nherself with one hand, turned around,\nwithdrew her iron ax, and suddenly\nthrust out her proud chest. Roar! A dark\ngreen lion's head phantom suddenly burst\nout from Olivia's chest and roared to\nthe sky. In an instant, all the black\nbeetles around them stopped. Meanwhile,\non the northern city wall, a mummified\ncorpse leaning on a magic wand stared\nblankly at the green lion shadow that\nappeared on the small building in the\ncenter of the town. the soul fire in its\neye sockets, trembling slightly. The\nundead legion, the overlords, what are\nyou doing here? After a moment's\nhesitation, the mummified corpse raised\nits withered arm and beckoned, causing\nthe black beetles that were still\nrampaging through the city to turn\naround and retreat to the north.\nAlthough the mummy was a powerful\nnecromancer, he could only retreat\nbefore the undead overlord. in the sky.\nValentina, who had used invisibility to\nkeep Fong Yu suspended in midair,\nfollowed the retreating beetles to the\nnorth and quickly spotted the strange\nmummified corpse standing on the city\nwall. Found it. Valentina's lips curled\ninto a cold, alluring smile. Fongu\nfollowed Valentina's gaze, but all he\ncould see was darkness. He didn't have\nValentina's night vision, so he asked,\n\"What did you find?\" Valentina replied.\nWe found the owner of these insects.\nWould killing that guy solve the problem\nof these bugs. It should be fine.\nValentina nodded. Since that's the case,\nFong Yu said coldly. Then let's make our\nmove immediately. In the current\nsituation, every second of delay will\nresult in further losses for the town\nand potentially greater danger for the\nplayers. As you wish, master. As she\nspoke, Valentino waved her hand, sending\nFong Yu to Olivia's side on the small\nbuilding and then flew towards the north\ncity wall. Thump. With the support of\nthe winds ripples, Fong Yu landed safely\non the rooftop where Olivia rushed\nforward to help him. Thanks. Fongu\nsmiled slightly at Olivia, then\nimmediately sensed that something was a\nmiss. He turned his head and saw several\nplayers looking at him with extremely\ncomplicated expressions. There was awe,\nenvy, and admiration in his eyes and\neven a hint of fear. At this moment,\nSanjiming came over and said to Fong Yu\nwith a fawning smile, \"Boss, why are you\nonly arriving now? I must have had other\nthings to do.\" Fongu rolled his eyes and\nsaid, \"And you guys, over a thousand\npeople, and you couldn't even hold off a\nbunch of bugs.\" Song Jimming said with a\nbitter face, \"Hey, you can't blame us\nentirely. It was the middle of the night\nand dark and the lookouts didn't see\nthese bugs. By the time they spotted\nthem, they had already come in. Then why\ndidn't you organize anyone to fight\nback? Funu asked again. I did organize\nit. Song Jimming quickly explained, but\neveryone just got together and there's\nno coordination or unity. So organizing\nit was quite difficult. And what song\nJimming sighed and said, \"Moreover, most\npeople value their lives and no one is\nwilling to stay behind to resist the\nswarms attack. They're&lt;unk&gt; all busy\nrunning away, so all right.\" Fongi waved\nhis hand and said, \"I understand.\" He\nthen looked at the players beside him\nand asked, \"Are these people staying\nbehind to fight off the swarm with you?\"\nSong Jimming nodded. Not bad. Fong Yu\nraised an eyebrow and said, \"You can\nreuse him in the future.\" Yes, yes. Song\nJimming nodded and said, \"That's what I\nthink, too. Those who step forward in a\nlife or death situation are unlikely to\nbe of bad character.\" Fongu didn't try\nto hide his voice, so the players\nnaturally heard what he said and were\nimmediately overjoyed. Being noticed by\nthe top player in District 6 means he's\nfinally established himself here. A\nquick-witted male player stepped forward\nand said to Fong Yu, \"Thank you for your\nappreciation, boss.\" Seeing this, the\nothers also stepped forward to express\ntheir loyalty. At this point, Fong Yu\nwas already an extremely revered figure\nin the hearts of these people. After\nall, the genuine swordsman level maid\nwas still standing behind Fong Yu. And\nhow strong was Fong Yu, who had managed\nto subdue the female swordsman, grand\nswordsman, sword saint? Although they\ndidn't understand why Fongu was so\npowerful, they only felt envy and\nadmiration. There's a saying that goes,\n\"An ant may envy a dung beetle, but it\nwill never envy an eagle soaring in the\nsky.\" The gap between Fong Yu and them\nhad widened to the point that they could\nno longer feel jealous. The only thought\nin these players minds now was that\nfollowing such an awesome leader would\nsurely lead to a better and better\nfuture. Meanwhile, on the other side,\nValentina had already reached the north\ncity wall while the eerie mummified\ncorpse had leaped off the wall and\nlanded in the swarm of insects,\nseemingly trying to escape under the\ncover of the insects. Valentina sneered,\ntrying to run away. As she spoke, a\nspark appeared between her slender\nfingers. The next second, a fiery dragon\nflew out from her palm and swooped down\ntowards the eerie, dried up corpse below\nthe city wall. The eerie mummified\ncorpse seemed to sense the danger, and\nwhen it turned around, it saw the fire\ndragon flying towards it. But it was too\nlate to dodge. Suddenly, the mummy\nstretched out its withered hand and\nclenched its fist in the air towards the\nswarm of insects around it. Instantly,\nthe swarm of insects burst open, and\nstreams of thick black liquid poured\ninto the mummy's palm. The next second,\nthe mummy raised the magic staff in its\nother hand and shot a cloud of black\nsmoke at the fire dragon in the air.\nBoom! The fire dragon crashed into the\nsmoke screen, causing a massive\nexplosion. Large sways of flames\nscattered in all directions, and the\nsmoke screen rapidly shrank under the\nscorching heat of the flames. But by the\ntime the fire dragon's flames completely\nevaporated the smoke, the mummified\ncorpse had already vanished from its\nspot. Taking advantage of this gap, it\nhad stepped onto the swarm of insects\nand fled towards the cemetery on the\ndistant hills. Damn it, why is she here,\ntoo? The mummified corpse cursed. He had\nspotted Valentina controlling the fire\ndragon in midair and recognized her. For\nany mage, regardless of their magic\nsystem, anyone born after that female\nelf would know her. A once powerful\nSaint Magus, who stood at the pinnacle\nof magic, single-handedly confronted the\nmighty elf queen of the entire dragon\nborn continent. Although the necromancer\ncould tell that the other party was just\na soul, he had no doubt that her\nstrength could crush him. The\nnecromancer's advantage lies in his\nmassive undead army, his physical combat\nstrength is actually quite average.\nHowever, when facing Valentina, an\nall-elemental mage, he would be\ninstantly killed. With the cemetery\nwithin reach, the panic in the mummified\ncorpse's eyes finally subsided somewhat.\nAs long as he hides in the cemetery, he\ncan escape underground through the\ncomplex crypts and lie dormant, making\nit impossible for even the powerful elf\nqueen to find him. Moreover, his undead\nbeetles have already spread the plague\ninto that city. In just a few days,\neveryone in the city will be killed by\nthe plague and turned into vengeful\nspirits. At that time, he will be able\nto absorb the power of those vengeful\nspirits and restore his former strength.\nHowever, just as the necromancer was\nmaking his plans and preparing to sneak\ninto the nearest grave, suddenly, a bolt\nof lightning struck the grave, splitting\nthe tombstone and blasting a huge crater\ninto the entire cemetery. The\nnecromancer was startled and turned\naround to find Valentina standing in\nfront of him, looking at him with cold\neyes. The necromancer's eyes flickered\nslightly with soul fire, and he\nimmediately knelt down, bowing his head\nand saying, \"Great elf queen, guardian\nof Midar Forest, Lord of the Magic\nThrone, the humble necromancer Gregory\nTargaryen, offers you his most sincere\ngreetings.\" Gregory Valentina's lips\ncurled slightly as she asked. The undead\nrace of the Targaryen Dark Council. It\nis I. The mummified corpse smoothed a\nstrand of dry yellow hair from his\nforehead, looked up at Valentina, and\nsaid, \"Your majesty, I had no intention\nof offending you or the king. Please\nforgive my abruptness. In this world,\nstrength means everything. The only way\nfor those in a lower position to survive\nin front of those in a higher position\nis to wag their tails and beg for mercy.\nAs for fighting to the death, that would\nat most allow him to die with dignity.\nBut for a necromancer like Gregory,\ndignity didn't matter. He just wanted to\nlive and live as long as possible. After\nlistening to the necromancer's plea,\nValentino looked troubled and replied,\n\"Considering we're both in the dark\nfaction, I wouldn't mind letting you go.\nHowever, my master just told me to kill\nyou, master. The soul fire in the\ndesiccated corpse's eye sockets trembled\nviolently, as if realizing something,\nand it cried out in a trembling voice.\nCould it be? Could it be that a new dark\ngods envoy has appeared? Valentina\nsmiled slightly and said, \"You do have\nsome knowledge. All right, since your\nattitude is not bad, I won't torment you\nanymore. You can rest in peace now.\"\nBefore the necromancer could say\nanything more, a purple six-pointed star\nmagic circle suddenly appeared on the\nfemale ghost's forehead. The magic\ncircle shot out and instantly enveloped\nthe terrified mummified corpse. No! The\nmummified corpse screamed eerily. \"I\ndon't want to die. I can't die. Please\nspare me. Please spare me.\" The\nmummified corpse's voice quickly\nsubsided as it began to rot rapidly\nunder the purple magic circle. The\nremaining flesh and bones turned to\nashes, and eventually even the skeleton\nturned into a wisp of smoke that drifted\naway in the wind. In the end, only a\ntrembling remnant soul remained,\nimprisoned within the purple magic\ncircle. Valentina beckoned to the\nremnant soul and said calmly, \"Your\ndissipation was not meaningless. Your\nsoul power will help me recover faster.\nMay darkness protect you, Gregory\nTargaryen.\" After saying that, Valentina\nswallowed the remnant soul hole. At the\nsame time, the black beetles that had\nbeen lying motionless on the ground\nbegan to explode one by one, and soon\nthe hillside cemetery was covered with a\nlayer of extremely foul smelling black\ninsect blood. Looking at the dead swarm\nof insects, Valentina knew that the task\nFong Yu had given her was complete. She\nwas about to rush back to Fongu to claim\nher credit when she suddenly sensed\nsomething. She twitched her nostrils\nslightly, sniffed the fishy stench in\nthe air, and her face immediately turned\npale. Black beetle swarm, necromancer,\nundead plague. Oh no! On a small\nbuilding in the center of town, Fongu\nwas surrounded by Song Jimming and\nseveral other players. These players\nwere very excited because all the damned\nblack beetles had suddenly died, which\nmeant that the crisis should be over.\n\"Wow, how did you do that?\" a male\nplayer asked curiously. Why did all\nthose bugs suddenly explode on their\nown? In their view, Fongu was the only\none who might make a move at the moment.\nFongu did not deny it and said calmly,\n\"I just sent people to hunt down the\nculprit who controlled the swarm.\nJudging from the situation, the culprit\nshould have been killed. Holy crap, this\nswarm is controlled by humans. Who is\nthis terrifying person who can control\nso many insects? Is it a player?\" Fony\nwas speechless for a moment because he\ndidn't know who the other party was and\nwhether they were players or not was\nreally impossible to verify. At this\nmoment, Olivia bent down and picked up\nthe corpse of a black beetle. She\nexamined it closely and said with a grim\nexpression, \"These are not ordinary\ninsects. They are necromancer beetles.\"\n\"Necroantic beetle?\" Funu frowned. The\nname sounded eerie. He was about to ask\nOlivia what a necroantic beetle was when\nthe game assistance notification popped\nup. Necroantic beetle blue rare quality.\nOriginally a black star beetle with mild\ntoxicity. It was transformed into a\nnecroantic beetle under the corruption\nof the necromancer's necroantic energy.\nIt has an extremely strong desire to\nattack living things, devours their\nflesh, and spreads a plague that can\nkill quickly. It can help the\nnecromancer create a large army of\nundead and is one of the necromancer's\nfavorite pets. Fong Yu frowned after\nreading the necromancer prompt. He\ndidn't know why a necromancer would\nattack this place, but in his\nunderstanding, necromancers were\nextremely difficult to deal with.\nFortunately, judging from the deaths of\nthese insects, Valentina must have\nkilled the necromancer. H. In less than\nthe time it takes to drink a cup of tea,\nValentina single-handedly killed a\nnecromancer. Fonu realized that he\nseemed to have underestimated his female\nghost companion. Just then, a white\nfigure flew in from the northern night\nsky. It was Valentina in a white dress\nriding the wind. Holy crap, what's that?\nA sharp-eyed player noticed Valentina\nflying towards them. What the heck? Let\nme see. Oh my god, it looks like a\nghost. Upon hearing this, everyone\nturned to look at Valentina, who was\nswooping down. When they saw Valentina's\ntranslucent figure emitting a faint\npurple light, several players, including\nSong Jming, were so frightened that they\nprepared to jump off the building to\nescape. \"Don't panic,\" Fong Yu shouted.\n\"We're&lt;unk&gt; on the same side.\" \"One of\nour own? That looks more like a ghost to\nme. What do you mean by similar?\" \"It's\nclearly the same.\" As she spoke,\nValentino landed and the surrounding\nplayers quickly moved aside. But soon,\none player made a new discovery. \"Holy\ncrap, I saw the ghost's face,\" the\nplayer exclaimed in a low voice. \"And\nthen what is it? That your face is\ncovered in soores, your eyes stick out,\nand you look absolutely hideous.\" \"No,\nno, no, not ugly at all. She's even\nprettier than any celebrity I've ever\nseen.\" Upon hearing this, the leerous\nmale players immediately lost their fear\nand began to scrutinize Valentina who\nhad landed next to Fong Yu. Master, I've\nalready dealt with the mastermind behind\nthis attack. Valentina said with a sweet\nsmile to Fong Yu. Thank you for your\nhard work. Fongu smiled and nodded, then\nasked, \"Are you a necromancer?\"\nValentina's smile faded as she said,\n\"Yes, although we've dealt with him,\nthere's still a very tricky problem to\nsolve.\" Fong Yu raised an eyebrow and\nasked, \"Is it about the plague?\"\nValentina was slightly takenback upon\nhearing this. \"How did you know?\" He\nFong Yu said with a calm smile, \"I\nhappen to know that these insects can\nspread plague. So, do you have any way\nto deal with the plague brought by these\ninsects?\" Valentina frowned and said,\n\"There is a way. The plague toxin of the\nnecroantic worms is not strong. It is\nonly effective against ordinary people\nand other living beings.\" However, the\npotion to cure the necroantic worms\ntoxin requires the venom glands of the\nnecroantic worms or spiders. Necroantic\ninsect venom glands. Fu glanced down at\nthe exploded insect corpses on the\nground and asked, \"Can we find venom\nglands in those insect corpses?\"\nValentina shook her head and said, \"They\nall died from exploding bodies.\" I\nestimate that less than one in 10 could\nretain their intact venom glands and\ncollecting them would be too\ntroublesome. There are many people in\nthis city and quite a few of them must\nbe infected with the plague. I'm afraid\nwe can't produce that many antidotes in\na short time. But the onset of the\nnecroantic plague is very fast. If they\ndon't take the antidote within 3 hours,\nthey basically can't be saved. It seems\nthat the crisis is not completely over.\nFong Yu sighed helplessly and waved to\nSong Jimming. Coming coming. Song\nJimming scured over saying as he went,\n\"Hey boss, who's this ghost girl?\" Fong\nYu glanced at Song Jimming and said\nirritably, \"Her name is Valentina and\nshe is a magician.\" Upon hearing this,\nSong Jimming glanced at Olivia on the\nother side behind Fong Yu. Then back at\nFong Yu, took a slight breath, and\ntentatively asked, \"Is this your servant\nagain?\" Fong Yu nodded and said, \"She\nkilled the necromancer who was\ncontrolling the swarm this time. You\nshould all thank her.\" Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s\nwords stunned not only Song Juming, but\nalso the male players behind him. What\nis that? This female ghost just killed a\nnecromancer. A powerful necromancer who\ncould control swarms of tens of\nthousands of insects to attack a city. A\nnecromancer who made the players of the\ncity flee in disarray was just killed by\nthis seemingly weak female ghost. Are\nyou kidding me? However, they soon\nremembered that Olivia, who was holding\nan iron axe, was actually a powerful\nswordsman. Could it be that this\nseemingly frail female ghost is actually\na highle boss? Thinking about this, the\nexpressions on the player's faces became\nquite interesting. Of course, Fongu\ndidn't have time for nonsense. He\ndirectly told Song Jiming, \"Immediately\nnotify the players here in the chat\nchannel that the crisis has been\nresolved. And at the same time, have all\nthe players who have been bitten by the\nbugs gathered together? Gather them\ntogether? What? Song Jimming asked,\npuzzled. The insects are poisonous. If\nwe don't remove the toxins from them\nwithin 3 hours, they're all doomed. Fong\nYu explained succinctly before adding.\nI'll go back and find an antidote now.\nThe rest is up to you. After saying\nthat, Fong Yu gave Valentina a look. And\nthen the female ghost waved her long\nsleeves, taking Fong Yu and Olivia into\nthe sky and disappearing into the night.\nOnly after Fong Yu and his two\ncompanions disappeared into the night\ndid a player approach Song Jimming and\nask, \"Old, do you know that female\nghost? She's not some powerful female\nboss, either is she?\" Song Jimming was\nstunned for a moment, then shook his\nhead and said, \"I don't know her either.\nBut if that female ghost wasn't lying,\nand she could kill a necromancer\nsingle-handedly, then she should be a\nhighle expert. They are high-level\nmages, at the very least, arch mages, a\ntall, thin man said. Song Jimming\nglanced at the tall, thin man in\nsurprise and asked, \"How did you know?\"\nThe tall thin man replied, \"I once\nobtained a mage's notebook, which\nrecorded that the most basic requirement\nfor becoming a necromancer is to be a\nmage.\" In other words, the necromancer's\nlevel is above that of a mage. If this\nfemale ghost can really kill a\nnecromancer in one go, and considering\nthe wind magic she just easily cast,\nthen her level must be above that of a\nmage. Everyone suddenly realized. One\nplayer exclaimed, \"Holy crap. So, Fong\nnot only has a female warrior servant at\nthe swordsman level, but also a female\nmage servant at the archage level.\" Tsk\ntsk. How did he do that? How can he tame\nsuch powerful servants? And they're all\nso beautiful. Another player exclaimed\nenviously, \"Perhaps Boss Fongu has some\nspecial skills.\" Special skills? What\nspecial skills? Didn't you notice? Those\ntwo powerful servants are both women.\nWomen's special talent. I get it.\nEveryone immediately understood. Hey,\nhey, hey, watch yourselves. Song Jimming\nsnapped, his face stern. Stop gossiping\nabout Brother Fong behind his back.\nUnderstand? One player replied, \"Hey,\nLao Song, don't overthink it. We're just\nreally envious of Brother Fong. He has\ntwo powerful maids by his side, which\nmakes us single guys so jealous.\"\nAnother player side. Sigh. I was\nthinking about whether I'd have a chance\nto pursue Olivia, but it seems like\nthat's not going to happen now. Not\nnecessarily, said a male player with a\nmustache. Based on my experience of\ndating for over a decade, Fong Yu and\nthe two maids don't seem to have a close\nrelationship. Holy crap. Is this true?\nDoes this mean I have a chance? That's\ngreat. But let's make this clear. I've\ngot my eye on that female ghost. Don't\ntry to take her from me. Damn, dude.\nYou've got some serious tastes. You\ndon't even spare ghosts. TCH, what's\nthere to be afraid of? In ancient times,\nthere was Ning Kaichin and Xiaoin&lt;unk&gt;s\nlove story between a human and a ghost.\nNow, I Hu Chong am a female ghost in a\nIs that so wrong? He sure, but I'm just\ncurious. Besides falling in love, what\nelse can humans and ghosts do? I'm\ncurious, too. Standing to the side, Song\nJimming listened to these guys\nnonsensical remarks and helplessly wiped\nhis face. If it weren't for the fact\nthat these guys risked their lives to\nstay behind with him and cover their\nretreat, he would have already started\ncursing. What kind of trash are you?\nDon't you even take a piss and look at\nyourselves? Do you think you can catch\nthe eye of those two big female\ncelebrities? So, Song Jimming said, \"All\nright, all right. Stop fantasizing.\nWhat's the point of thinking about it\nanymore? I've already said that he's\nFong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s servant, not some\nunclaimed native. So, stop thinking\nabout it.\" To everyone's surprise, San\nJimming&lt;unk&gt;s words successfully broaden\nthese guys thinking. Huh, that makes\nsense. If we want to pursue those two\ngoddesses, shouldn't we first build a\ngood relationship with Boss Fong Yu?\nIsn't that obvious? Boss Fong Yu is\ntheir master. By seniority, he's my\nfather-in-law. Father-in-law? No. No.\nHe's the master, not the father. He\nshould be called Godfather. Uh, yes.\nYes. Yes. Godfather. That's right. I\nhereby declare that from this day\nforward, boss Fong Yu is my godfather.\nSome quick-fingered individuals have\nalready opened the friend channel and\nstarted requesting to add Fong Yu as a\nfriend. Some have even gone so far as to\nannounce in the chat channel that they\nwant to become Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s adopted\nson. Fong Yu, the person involved, saw\nthe friend requests and messages in the\nchat channel during the time he flew\nback to the cabin and was completely\nbewildered. What is that? Why would\nsomeone suddenly want to recognize me as\ntheir godfather? Why does it feel like\nthere's a conspiracy? Of course, he\ndidn't have time to ask in detail now.\nThe first thing he did upon returning to\nthe cabin was to prepare the materials\nneeded for Valentina to make the\nantidote. Fortunately, he had access to\na trading post with abundant resources,\nand the materials were all common items\nsuch as wood, ash, and spider glands,\nwhich he could easily buy. At this\nmoment, Sanjuming also reported the\nnumber of poison players, a total of 455\npeople, no more and no less. However,\nFong Yu discovered that there were only\n230 spider glands in the entire\nexchange, and each antidote required at\nleast one spider gland, which meant that\nmore than 200 people would not receive\ntreatment. The settlement in Yorktown is\nmostly populated by players from Fong\nYu's fan club, meaning they all support\nFong Yu. It wouldn't be appropriate to\njust stand by and watch him die.\nMoreover, settlements are being\nestablished everywhere, and there may be\ninvasions from players from other\nregions later on. So, the construction\nof Yorktown is imperative. However, if\nhundreds of people die at once, it will\ninevitably affect everyone's enthusiasm\nand discourage other players who are\nhesitant about joining. What should we\ndo? How about we go kill some spiders in\nthe spider forest? However, the drop\nrate of spider glands is less than 1/5if\nand only spiders larger than pumpkins\nhave a chance of dropping them. Spiders\nthat are only the size of a football or\nfist don't drop them at all. This means\nthat they would have to kill over a\nthousand giant spiders to collect just\nover 200 spider glands. Putting aside\nthe question of whether there's enough\ntime, the key issue is whether there are\neven that many giant spiders in that\nforest to the east. Headache. Where can\nI get so many spider glands, etc. Fong\nYu suddenly thought of something. Spider\nglands? Detoxification? H. I was once\npoisoned by a spider and then Sakura\nsaved me. He remembered that the poison\nof the cherry blossom seemed to have an\nantidote. He just didn't know if it\ncould also cure the poison of the undead\nbeetle. Seemingly sensing Fong Yu's\nquestion, the game assistant provided a\nprompt. The mutant spider cherry blossom\nis of blue rare quality. Its venom can\nneutralize all biological toxins below\nblue quality. And it can also neutralize\nthe venom of the undead beetle. Oh,\nthat's fine. However, the toxins stored\nin cherry blossoms alone probably won't\nbe enough to save so many people, right?\nHow about we try diluting it? I don't\nknow if that will reduce the\neffectiveness. To completely neutralize\nthe venom of the undead beetle, dilute\nwith water at a ratio of 1:2. However,\nif only a temporary relief is needed,\nextending the venom's duration from 3\nhours to 12 hours, a dilution of 110 is\nacceptable. So, Fong Yu instructed\nValentina to make an antidote and then\nran to the monster house to bring the\nlittle spider Sakura back inside. Little\nSakura, you'll have to work hard today.\nFunu placed Sakura on the dining table\nand upon closer inspection, noticed that\nthe little one seemed to have undergone\nsome changes. At this point, it could\nhardly be considered a small creature\nanymore. The diameter of its torso was\nabout 30 cm, and if you included its\nlegs, it was almost half a meter long.\nIf it weren't for its pink face and its\nsix adorable looking eyes, Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s\ninsect phobia would probably have flared\nup again. More importantly, Fong Yu\nnoticed that a layer of white magic\npattern seemed to have appeared on the\nskin under its fur, which should be due\nto the influence of the remains of the\nmagic patterned giant spider. I wonder\nwhat this little guy will evolve into in\nthe future. Could it grow to be 3 or 4 m\ntall like the giant spider? Little\nSakura shook her head, seemingly not\nunderstanding what Fongu wanted to do by\ncarrying her into the house. At this\nmoment, Fong Yu took out a wooden bowl\nand placed it near Shaoling Hua's mouth,\nsaying, \"Do me a favor. Spit out some of\nyour venom as much as possible.\" After a\nmoment, Fong Yu looked at the small\npuddle of venom at the bottom of the\nbowl and tentatively asked Shiaing Hua,\n\"Is that all? Is there anymore?\" Sakura\nshook her head frantically, then jumped\noff the table and dashed out of the\nwooden house in a flash. If it's not\nthere, it's not there. Why run so fast?\nFongu raised an eyebrow, glanced at the\npink venom in the wooden bowl, and\nmuttered, \"I wonder if it's enough.\"\nthe answer. Four drops of mutated venom\ncan completely neutralize the undead\nbeetles toxin. There are currently 532\ndrops in the wooden bowl. After\naccounting for transfer losses, there\nare approximately 500 drops. diluted at\na 1:2 ratio. It's enough to detoxify 250\npeople. Fongu breathed a sigh of relief.\nIf that was the case, the antidote\nValentina had prepared should be enough.\nSo, he started buying glass tubes, the\nkind used for testing at the exchange.\nThis item is a white item. It can be\nmade using a crafting table as long as\nyou have quartz. Quartz is also easy to\nobtain. You can simply burn sand in a\nsmelting furnace. Fong Yu didn't\nmanufacture it himself purely because he\nwas in a hurry. After purchasing the\nglass tubes, Fong Yu and Olivia began\ntransferring the mutated venom from the\nwooden bowl. Once they had transferred\nall the venom into the glass tubes,\nValentina had also completed the\nrefining of all the antidotes. An hour\nand a half has already passed. With more\nthan an hour to go before the outbreak\nof the plague toxin, Funu breathed a\nsigh of relief. Meanwhile, the players\nin Yorktown were in an uproar. For those\nwho had been poisoned, their lives were\ndown to an hour and a half. If Song\nJimming hadn't mentioned that Fong Yu\nwas trying to make an antidote for them,\nthese desperate players would probably\nhave already rioted. The messages in the\nchat channel were varied. Some people\nthanked Fong Yu and his two beautiful\nfemale servants for repelling the swarm\nof insects and necromancers. Some wanted\nto become Fong Yu's godfather and others\nquestioned the origins of the insects\nand necromancers. Of course, most of the\nplayers were seeking an antidote. The\nplayers who have survived until now are\nnot stupid. The number of known poisoned\npeople has exceeded 500. How could Fong\nYu alone possibly have more than 500\ndoses of antidote? Moreover, only\nalchemists who have changed their\nprofession to alchemy can make\nantidotes. Could it be that Fong Yu is\nan alchemist? Even so, it would be\nimpossible to refine more than 500 doses\nof medicine in 3 hours. However,\nalthough they knew that Fongu couldn't\npossibly produce that many doses of\nmedicine, it was still possible for him\nto produce dozens of doses. So, how are\nthese 500 plus poison players supposed\nto get the potions that Fong Yu can only\nget a few dozen of? Rob, that's\nobviously unrealistic. The fact that\nFong Yu has two exceptionally powerful\nand beautiful female servants has\nalready spread among these players.\nSwordsmen, Archmitch, what does this\nmean? Dealing with these ordinary\nplayers, most of whom haven't even\nchanged classes yet, is as easy as\ncutting melons and vegetables. Moreover,\nthey didn't even know where Fong Yu was.\nThat leaves only one other method,\nauction bidding. Highest bidder wins.\nThe main focus is on fairness. Everyone\nenters the game practically naked. The\namount of wealth depends entirely on\none's own ability. There are no second\ngeneration officials or businessmen.\nSurvival depends on whether you can\nafford the price. And so a lively\nauction began in Yorktown. The auction\nwas entirely spontaneous, but Song\nJimming was still appointed as the\nauctioneer to auction off Fong Yu's\nantidote. Yes, even before Fong Yu's\nantidote was manufactured and even\nbefore they knew how much there was,\nthese poison players had already started\nparticipating in the auction. Hey buddy,\nare you stupid? We don't even know if\nFong Yu has an antidote yet. What if\nthis is a scam? One of the worried\nplayers said to the player next to him.\nYou think I don't know? The player who\nwas asked rolled his eyes and replied,\n\"But what can I do? You can't disbelieve\nme. Is there anyone else who can produce\nan antidote? No. So, I can only try\nanything as a last resort. What if we\ngive him supplies, but he doesn't give\nus the potions? After all, this auction\nis different from the system exchange.\nWe have to give him supplies first. I've\nheard that many settlement creators use\nvarious pretexts to collect supplies\nfrom players who join them. Do you think\nFongu might also try to use this\nantidote to fleece us? Wow, if you put\nit that way, it really does look quite\nsimilar. Damn, now that you mention it,\nI'm even starting to wonder if Fong Yu\nis the mastermind behind this undead\nbeetle attack. He deliberately used\nswarms of poisonous insects to infect us\nand then sold the pre-prepared antidote\nat a high price. H, that explains why he\nwas able to produce so many antidotes\nall at once. I never imagined Fong You\nwould be this kind of person. Humph. I\nknew I shouldn't have come to Yorktown.\nAt this moment, a female player nearby\noverheard their conversation and\nimmediately retorted, \"Don't talk\nnonsense. Boss Fong Yu isn't that kind\nof person.\" TCH, who are you? How do you\nknow Fong Yu isn't that kind of person?\nMy name is Lu Xiao Fang. I'm a member of\nFong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s fan club. The female\nplayer said, \"Boss Fong Yu finally\nmanaged to take this town from the\npigheaded people, and now he's inviting\neveryone to develop it together. He\ndefinitely doesn't have the kind of bad\nintentions you're talking about.\nExactly. Another player from Fong\nYu&lt;unk&gt;s support group retorted, \"Fong\nYu has been sharing all sorts of\nsurvival tips in the chat channel if it\nweren't for him sharing information\nabout catching crows. Who knows how many\nmore people would have died in our\nregion, and you're still judging him\nwith your petty minds?\" Upon hearing\nthis, the players who had been gossiping\nabout Fong You fell silent. Indeed,\nthese players were able to survive the\nprevious winter challenge, mainly by\nusing the information about catching\nJack Daws shared by Fong Yu, which is\nwhy these players are willing to come to\nYorktown ruins to develop together. Just\nthen, a player suddenly shouted, \"Look\nat the Yorktown chat channel.\" Boss\nFongu has spoken. As soon as these words\nwere spoken, everyone opened the chat\nchannel. Fong Yu ID006, hello everyone\nin Yorktown. This insect swarm attack\ncame suddenly. Although I managed to\nkill the necromancer who launched the\nattack in time, many players have still\nbeen infected with the plague virus.\nFortunately, I've just brewed enough\nantidotes which I'll be listing on the\nexchange soon. Anyone can buy them.\nConsidering the cost, I've decided to\nprice each antidote at 50 wood. If\nanyone is short on resources, we can\nborrow from each other. Holy crap, he\nactually managed to concoct so many\nantidotes. Stop talking nonsense. Hurry\nup and get into the exchange to grab it.\nOh yes, yes, yes. Oh dear, I only have\n30 pieces of wood. Could any kind\nbrother lend me 20 pieces? Inside the\ncabin, Fongu breathed a sigh of relief\nafter listing all the antidotes on the\nexchange. He's done what he was supposed\nto do. The rest is none of his business.\nAs for the antidote, the price of 50\npieces of wood was determined after\ncareful consideration. There are two\nkinds of potions this time. One is made\nby Valentina using spider glands and\nwood ash. The cost is actually not high.\nThe price of one spider gland is only\nabout 10 wood, and wood ash is even less\nvaluable. Everyone has it in their\ncampfire. The antidote made by diluting\nthe venom of the cherry blossom is even\nless expensive. At most, you could feed\nit in extra roasted chicken at night. As\nfor the glass tubes used to hold the\nmedicine, they are white and made from\nquartz powder made from sand. One unit\nof sand can make 10 glass bottles. So,\nthe cost is negligible. So, with tears\nin his eyes, Fongu made a small profit\nof over 20,000 units of timber from\nthese 500 plus bottles of potion.\nMaster, those people will be your\nsubjects from now on. Why don't you\ndistribute those antidotes to them for\nfree? Valentina asked curiously. Upon\nhearing this, Fong Yu laughed and said,\n\"He, I understand what you mean. You're\ngiving it to them for free to win their\nfavor, right? But human nature isn't\nthat simple.\" \"Huh? What do you mean?\"\nValentina tilted her head, seemingly not\nquite understanding. Fong Yu explained,\n\"No one will cherish something they get\nfor free, and they will look down on me\nand not take me seriously because of it.\nMoreover, once this kind of free giving\nis started, if a similar situation\noccurs again, those people will ask me\nto give it to them again for free. If I\ndon't give it to them for free, they\nwill hate me instead. That's human\nnature. Valentina blinked her big eyes,\nturned to look at Olivia, and asked, \"Is\nthat really true?\" Olivia gave Fongu a\nmeaningful look, then nodded and said,\n\"Master is right. The filth in people's\nhearts is far beyond your imagination.\"\nI see. Valentina smiled slightly,\nlooking at Fong Yu with curiosity. But\nmaster, you are clearly not that old. So\nwhy do you have such a profound\nunderstanding of human nature? Fongu\nsmiled Riley and said, \"Maybe it's\nbecause I used to live in a world of\ninformation overload.\" Valentina was\ntaken aback by the information explosion\nand looked at Olivia curiously, asking,\n\"What does this mean?\" Olivia shrugged\nand said, \"Don't look at me. I don't\nunderstand either. Chapter 121. Learning\nfire dragon spell. Advancing to\nintermediate mage. The antidote that\nFong Yu put up for sale was sold out in\njust 2 minutes. And no one in the entire\nchat channel complained about why Fongu\ndidn't give out the antidote for free.\nFirstly, the price of 50 wood is not\nhigh to begin with, and players with\niron axes can easily chop up 50 wood in\nhalf a day. Secondly, considering the\nlife-saving value of this medicine and\nthe difficulty in obtaining the spider\nglands and the raw material, the price\nof 50 wood is already very reasonable.\nNo one doubted whether the swarm attack\nwas related to Fong Yu anymore since the\nlife-saving antidote only sold for 50\nwood, which was not profitable at all.\nTherefore, the chat channel was quickly\nflooded with messages of gratitude to\nFong Yu. Of course, Fongu didn't care\nabout any of that. He was only concerned\nabout the stewed pork hawk simmering in\nthe iron pot in front of him. He was\nvery hungry after a busy night, so he\nmade a late night snack himself as soon\nas he got back. Seeing that the soup in\nthe pot was almost ready, Fongu grabbed\na handful of chopped scallions and\nsprinkled them in. All done, ready to\nget started. As he spoke, Fong Yu picked\nup a soup spoon and served a bowl each\nto Alpha and Olivia, who were sitting\nnext to him and had been waiting\neagerly. Alpha's bowl contained a meaty\nbone and he couldn't wait a second\nlonger. He immediately bit the bone into\nhis mouth and started chewing it with a\ncrunch crunch sound. In contrast,\nOlivia's eating manners were much more\nrefined. She first thanked Fong Yu, then\npicked up her knife and fork and began\nto break down the pieces of meat in her\nbowl. She picked up a small piece of\nmeat with her fork and put it in her\nmouth to chew slowly. Her actions and\nposture revealed a touch of nobility and\nelegance. Funu turned to look at\nValentina floating beside him. Just as\nhe was about to say something, Valentina\ninterrupted him with a smile, saying,\n\"Master, don't worry about me. I also\nhad a big meal tonight. A feast.\" Fu\nraised an eyebrow, somewhat puzzled.\nWhat kind of feast could a ghost\npossibly have? At this moment, Olivia\nswallowed a piece of meat and said, \"She\nmust have just devoured that\nnecromancer's soul.\" Fongu suddenly felt\na chill run down his spine. It devoured\nthe necromancer's soul. \"H Valentina,\"\nnoticing Fong Yu's surprise, quickly\nexplained, \"It's like this, master. A\nnecromancer's soul can only be\ncompletely killed by a highranking\narchage of the light element using holy\nlight purification magic. Otherwise, it\ncan escape and rise again at any time.\nSo, I used another method. Devour.\nValentina nodded. This is another way to\ncompletely kill a necromancer's soul.\nMaster, you won't mind. Will you mind?\nOf course not. Fongu shook his head with\na rice smile and said, \"I'm just worried\nthat there might be some side effects if\nyou devour it.\" Valentina felt a warmth\nin her heart upon hearing this and\nsmiled. Don't worry, that guy's soul\nlevel isn't high, so he poses no threat\nto me. In just one or two more days,\nI'll be able to completely absorb his\nsoul energy and erase his soul imprint.\nMoreover, with the support of his soul\nenergy, I'll be able to revive even\nfaster. Resurrection. Looking at the\ngentle and lovely ghost in front of him,\nFong Yu smiled slightly and said, \"Then\nI'm relieved.\" After finishing her\nmidnight snack, it was already past 300\na.m. Valentina rested during the day and\nwas active at night. She went to the\nenchanting table to make a wand.\nValentina said that there was a big\ndifference between a magician with a\nwand and a magician without a wand. So,\nshe planned to make one for Fongu. Fongu\ntook a look and found that the wand was\nalready taking shape on the enchanting\ntable. Valentina seemed to be using her\nmental power to control the liquefied\nmithil to inscribe a magic circle on the\nwand. There were also some elemental\ncrystals next to it, probably for\ninlaying. Master, you should go and\nrest. Judging from the current\nsituation, it will probably take at\nleast another 2 or 3 hours to finish\nmaking the wand. Olivia said to Fong Yu.\nShe had also absorbed a lot of life\nforce today, so she didn't need to go\nhunting anymore. Fongu nodded. In order\nto increase his magic power limit, he\nhad released a lot of magic today. In\naddition, he had just dealt with the\ninsect swarm attack and the\ndetoxification. He was so sleepy that he\ndidn't dare to disturb Valentina, who\nwas making a wand. After saying good\nnight to Olivia and Alpha, he went to\nhis bedroom to sleep. The next morning,\nwhen Fongu woke up, opened his bedroom\ndoor, and went to the living room, he\nsaw a 1- m long dark brown magic wand on\nthe dining table. The wand is\nstreamlined with a straight line and a\ncurve. The top is inlaid with the\nlargest purple magic crystal. A little\nbelow, six elemental crystals of\ndifferent colors are inlaid like stars\nsurrounding the moon. In addition, there\nare six empty slots below that, the\npurpose of which is unknown. Fongu\nlooked around but didn't see Valentina.\nSo, he picked up his wand and examined\nit closely. Incomplete all element\ncombat staff. Yellow excellent. a\nmasterpiece crafted by an alchemy\nmaster. This is a rare and excellent\nstaff. Even more remarkable is its\nability to fuse the energies of all 12\nmagical elements. It should be an epic\nlevel weapon, but due to the current\nlack of six magical crystals, it can\nonly be classified as excellent. When\nequipped, maximum mana plus 100, casting\nspeed plus 30%, and spell power plus\n30%. To be honest, Fongu has come into\ncontact with quite a few artifact level\nequipment in the past few days, such as\nthe book of the evil god, the ice\ngoddess's refrigerator, and the elegy of\nthe undead that he just obtained in the\nbasement last night. They are all red\ngrade artifacts. But if he had to say\nwhich piece of equipment he likes the\nmost, it would still be the battle staff\nin front of him because those artifacts\nwere basically obtained for free. But\nthis staff in front of her was custom\nmade by Valentina herself. So the\nfeeling was completely different.\nMoreover, for him now, this wand is far\nmore helpful than those artifacts.\nPutting aside everything else, just the\nincrease of 100 points in his maximum\nmana is almost enough to double his\nendurance. The 30% increase in casting\nspeed and spell power is also a huge\nboost. All things considered, his combat\npower has more than doubled.\nFurthermore, his magic power has reached\nthe requirement of 200. If he learns one\nmore intermediate spell from Valentina,\nhe can raise his mage level from\nlow-level mage to intermediate level\nmage. With that in mind, Fong Yu began\nsearching for Valentina in the house.\nPartly to thank her for making the staff\nfor him overnight, and partly to have\nher infuse him with another intermediate\nspell to learn. Soon, Fongu found\nValentina making breakfast in the\nkitchen. He excitedly said to her,\n\"Tina, thank you so much. This staff is\namazing. The female ghost seemed to have\nanticipated Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s reaction. She\nturned around, lowered her head, and\nsmiled at Fong Yu, saying, \"It is Tina's\nhonor to be able to do something of my\nhumble ability for my master.\" Fongu is\ngenuinely fond of her sensible\nappearance. By the way, Tina, tell me\nthe truth. How much soul power do you\nneed to restore your physical body?\nActually, there are quite a lot. Is the\nsoul of one dragon enough? Valentina's\neyes widened. She covered her mouth and\nexclaimed in surprise, \"A dragon? You\nwant to go and kill that dragon in the\nsouth?\" Fongu nodded and asked, \"So, do\nyou think there's any hope?\" Valentina\nsmiled helplessly and said, \"Master,\nit's good that you have such confidence,\nbut I suggest you think about dealing\nwith the dragon again after some time.\"\nAt this moment, Olivia also entered the\nliving room and said to Fongu, \"Master,\nthe dragon in the south is not on the\nsame level as the boar lord and the\nhuman-faced spider you met yesterday.\nYou should not think about slaying the\ndragon for now, but focus on improving\nyour own strength.\" Fongu understood\nwhat the two meant. It seemed that the\ngiant dragon was much more powerful than\nhe had imagined. \"All right, I'll do as\nyou say. By the way, Tina, my magic\npower has exceeded 200 after equipping\nthis wand. Could you teach me another\nintermediate spell so I can level up to\nintermediate mage? No problem, Master\nValentina smiled. But you'll have to\nwait until I finish making breakfast for\nyou. Okay, thanks for your hard work.\nAnd so, a new day began in the cozy\nhaunted house in the woods. After\nfinishing breakfast, Fongu sat upright\nin his chair. Valentina floated behind\nhim, her hands covering Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s\nhead, chanting mysterious incantations.\nStrands of magical spells woven from\nmental energy were being infused into\nFong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s mind. The magic Valentina\ninstilled was a mid-level fire magic,\nfire dragon technique, which Fong Yu had\nspecially chosen. There was only one\nreason. Among low to mid-level elemental\nmagic, fire magic has the highest attack\npower and is also the coolest. A moment\nlater, Valentina finished infusing the\nmagic. Having worked hard all night to\nforge the staff, she was now expending\nher mental energy to infuse magic into\nFong Yu. Even though she had absorbed a\nlot of soul power yesterday, she was\nstill somewhat overdrawn. She looked at\nOlivia beside her and said, \"I'm a\nlittle tired. I'll go back and rest\nfirst. When master wakes up later, you\ncan tell him.\" Olivia nodded. Valentina\nthen returned to her room. A moment\nlater, Fong Yu woke up. You have learned\nthe intermediate fire magic, fire\ndragon. Initial casting consumes 30 mana\npoints. Maintaining the fire dragon\nstate consumes one mana point per\nsecond. Fire dragon can attack enemies\nwithin 100 m, making it a very powerful\nintermediate offensive spell. You have\nmet the requirements for advancement to\nintermediate mage, magic power greater\nthan 200, and the ability to learn any\nintermediate spell. Advance your mage\nrank promotion. Congratulations on\nbecoming an intermediate level mage. So,\nwhat's the use of advancing to the\nintermediate level of magician? Fun was\nsomewhat curious. Besides being able to\nlearn intermediate magic, it has no\npractical use. It's just a title. It\nwill be useful later when the continent\nmap is unlocked and you travel to\ndifferent countries. Meanwhile, in a\ncity on the continent of young dragons,\nthousands of miles away, a mysterious\nfigure shrouded in a black robe entered\nan inconspicuous alley under the cover\nof night. The mysterious man stopped\ndeep in the alley and knocked on the\nwall in front of him. A moment later, a\nstone brick on the wall slowly flipped\nopen, revealing a pair of dead fish eyes\nthat suspiciously examined the\nmysterious person in front of them. Who\nis it? A huge mouth appeared from below\nthe wall and asked. The mysterious man\nrolled up his sleeves, revealing a\nsection of black Dalia tattoo on his\narm. After staring at the mysterious\nman's black Dalia tattoo for a while,\nthe eyes on the stone wall suddenly\nbecame polite and said, \"So, you are a\nlord of the undead race? May I ask what\nbrings you to the hub?\" The mysterious\nfigure slowly raised his head, two\npurple soul flames igniting beneath his\nhood. he said coldly. Who do you think\nyou are? I have matters to report to the\nspeaker. Upon hearing this, dead fish\neyes narrowed his eyes and replied\nreluctantly. But the speaker instructed\nthat unless it is something very\nimportant, we should not disturb him at\nthis time. You know the speaker's\nhabits. After a moment of silence, the\nmysterious man said in a deep voice, \"It\nconcerns the 10th spokesperson for the\ndark god.\" Upon hearing this, dead fish\neyes widened in surprise. The tenth son\nof darkness has appeared. The mysterious\nman said coldly, \"Is that something you\nshould be asking?\" \"Oh, you're right. I\nshouldn't have asked so many questions.\nPlease wait a moment. I'll open the door\nfor you right away.\" A moment later, the\nstone bricks on the wall retracted into\nthe wall one by one, revealing a\npassage. A goblin, less than a meter\ntall and dressed in a black robe, held\nan oil lamp and said, \"The speaker is on\nthe seventh basement level.\" The\nmysterious man ignored the blackroed\ngoblin and waved to the alley entrance.\nA dark figure darted out from the\ncorner, crossed the alley, and flew into\nthe mysterious man's sleeve.\nImmediately, the man in black robes\nwalked directly into the doorway.\nChapter 122. Song Jimming who got\nstabbed in the back. Actually, Fong Yu\nis quite interested in showing off.\nAfter all, it's very satisfying and has\na good practical effect. Often, simply\nstating your title is enough to\nintimidate your opponent, saving you a\nlot of trouble. What is the highest\nlevel of so-called pretentiousness? That\nis to subdue the enemy without fighting.\nYou don't believe me? That's the\nprinciple behind nuclear deterrence.\nFong Yu's goal is to increase his\nstrength as much as possible to become\nthe nuclear deterrent and then world\npeace can be achieved. Of course,\nthinking about world peace might be a\nbit far-fetched. So, he set himself a\nsmall goal first to achieve the peaceful\nreunification of his own region. After\nall, he couldn't just be a lazy bum who\ndidn't care about the world. He knew\nvery well that in this dangerous world\nof survival, if he didn't rack his\nbrains to create the means to survive,\nhe would likely die suddenly. Currently,\nconstruction of the Yorktown ruins has\nbegun. Although the previous insect\nswarm attack terrified the players in\nYorktown, Fong Yu handled it very well\nwith no players dying and even killing a\nterrifying necromancer. Furthermore,\nrumors that Fong Yu possessed a\nswordsman servant and a mage servant\nalso spread throughout District 6. At\nfirst, many players didn't believe it\nsince most people hadn't even reached\nthe initial job advancement stage. Yet,\nFong Yu already had a swordsman and a\nmage servant. To be honest, even the\nplayers in Yorktown didn't quite believe\nit. After all, the only players who had\nactually seen Olivia and Valentina were\na few who had fought off the insect\nswarm with Song jamming on the rooftop\nin the center of town. But those few had\ntold a story in great detail and were\neven willing to risk their lives, which\nmade the other players believe them to\nsome extent. As a result, more and more\nplayers are flocking to the Yorktown\nsettlement. According to the data\nprovided by Fatty Song, 922 people have\nalready moved into Yorktown and another\n1,500 people will arrive today. In\naddition, nearly 1,000 people also\nwanted to join the Yorktown ruins. But\nbecause the distance was too far and the\nroad was too dangerous, Fatty Song's\nplan was to let those people get through\nthe winter first and then next spring,\nhe would organize people to plan a route\nto bring those 1,000 players over. All\nthings considered, the number of players\nin the entire region willing to join\nYorktown is approaching 3,500,\nwhich is almost half of the remaining\nplayers in region 6. However, many\nplayers still seem uninterested in\njoining Yorktown. Fongu didn't intend to\nforce the issue since everyone has their\nown aspirations. Some people prefer a\ngroup lifestyle while others prefer to\nbe lone wolves. Moreover, Yorktown has a\nlimited land area and it may not be able\nto accommodate 3,500 people. According\nto Fong Yu, this number is about enough.\nIn fact, even Fong Yu himself belongs to\nthe type of person who likes to be a\nlone wolf. If it weren't for the fact\nthat Yorktown is so close to his manner\nand that he has such a group of fans in\nthe Fong Yu support group eagerly\nanticipating his return, he wouldn't\nbother with all this. Now all matters\nbig and small in Yorktown are handled by\nFatty Song while Fong Yu the initiator\nhas become a hands-off manager. Of\ncourse, his main role is not management\nbut deterrence. With him watching over\nthings, there won't be any major\nconflicts among the players in Yorktown.\nOverall, everything went according to\nhis original plan. To maintain this\nsituation, Fong Yu must maintain an\nabsolute advantage in military force, so\nthat even if any problems arise in\nYorktown, whether it is an external\ninvasion or an internal rebellion, he\ncan suppress them with force\nimmediately. The saying political power\ngrows out of the barrel of a gun, is not\njust a saying. It holds true throughout\nhistory and across the world. Therefore,\nimproving his own strength has become\nFong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s most important task. Now,\njust as Fong Yu was about to go out to\npractice his newly learned fire dragon\ntechnique, he received a message from\nSong Jimming. Song Jimming ID 3533.\nBrother Fong, help. I'm trapped in the\nrift of the cobalt lair. Fong Yu frowned\nand returned the message. Fong UD006,\nwhat's going on? Songing ID 3533. I was\nbetrayed by my teammates who came with\nme. Those guys took the cobalt mine and\nran off, leaving me here all alone. Song\njamming ID3533.\nIf it weren't for the dozens of pieces\nof pigheaded man's meat I still had in\nmy backpack, which temporarily calmed\nthe cobalt's anger, I would have been\ndead. Fong UID006.\nWhy is that cobalt still holding you\ncaptive? Song jamming ID 3533. I don't\nknow. We don't speak the language. I\nguess my meat isn't enough to compensate\nthose scoundrels for the ore they took.\nBrother Fong, come and save me. You\nshould know the location, right? Song\nJimming ID 3533. Hurry up. That bastard\nstabbed me. If I hadn't been playing\ndead, I probably would have really died.\nI'm about to die. You'd better bring\nsome medicine. Fong UID006.\nOkay, I'm coming right away. Hang in\nthere. After closing the chat channel,\nFongu frowned. He had long anticipated\nthat the sudden influx of so many\nplayers into Yorktown would inevitably\ncause trouble and that song jamming as\nthe manager would also face certain\nrisks, but he hadn't expected it to\nhappen so quickly. It seems that quite a\nfew people with ulterior motives have\ninfiltrated the players in Yorktown.\nFongu called out to Olivia and prepared\nto leave. At this moment, Alpha also\nwanted to come out, but Fong Yu glanced\nat its hairless rear end, shook his\nhead, and refused, saying, \"You should\nstay home and rest.\" Immediately, Fong\nYu and Olivia hurried towards the\ncobalt's lair. This time, after arriving\nat the river, Fongu did not let Olivia\ncarry him across the river. Instead, he\nused wind magic, dance of the wind, to\nfly across the river. It was his first\ntime flying and his control was not very\ngood. Although he flew shakily, he\nmanaged to land safely on the other\nside. After crossing the river, Fongu\npassed through Yorktown and noticed four\nmale players walking towards the town\nfrom the direction of Cobalt's rift. The\nfour players also happened to see Fongu\ncoming towards them. Upon seeing Fong\nYu, the people all showed expressions of\nterror and quickened their pace trying\nto get around him. Seeing this, Fong Yu\nvaguely guessed that these people were\nlikely the ones who betrayed Song\nJimming. Olivia, go and stop them, Fong\nYu said. Olivia nodded and dashed\nforward to block the four players. What\nare you doing? A male player shouted,\n\"Get out of the way.\" and tried to push\nOlivia away. But how could Olivia let\nsuch a scoundrel touch her? In the blink\nof an eye, her left hand grabbed the\nmale player's outstretched hand and\nsqueezed it hard. \"Ah!\" The male player\nscreamed and knelled on the ground,\nclutching his wrist. For a powerful\nswordsman to deal with an ordinary\nperson who hasn't even changed classes,\nit's as easy as an adult dealing with a\nthree-year-old child. The other three\nplayers were shocked to see this. One of\nthem pulled out an iron great sword from\nhis backpack and slashed at Olivia. The\nhuge blade cut through the air and\ncreated a whistling sound as if he had\nused a skill. Whirling slash. The great\nsword carrying a fierce force slashed\nstraight down at Olivia's head,\nseemingly aiming to cleave her in two.\nBut who is Olivia? She slightly turned\nher body, and the blade of the great\nsword grazed the bandage on her chest,\nmissing its mark. At the same time, her\nhand reached for the iron axe behind her\nback, and with a gentle pull, she struck\nthe side of the great sword's blade with\nthe axe. With a clang, the male player's\ngreatsword was smashed away by the iron\naxe. At the same time, Olivia used the\nmomentum of falling backward to make her\nbody rotate 180° in midair and used the\niron axe in her hand to cut off the male\nplayer's right leg, blood spurting out\nlike a pillar. Ah! Another scream rang\nout and the male player also collapsed\nto the ground. Olivia braced herself\nwith one hand just before landing, gave\na gentle push, and stood up again,\nholding the dripping iron ax as she\nlooked at the remaining two dumbfounded\nplayers. All of this happened in just 5\nseconds, stunning not only the remaining\ntwo players, but also Fong Yu, who had\nrushed over and even raised an eyebrow\nin surprise. This melee combat skill is\nabsolutely amazing. At this moment,\nseveral players who were guarding the\nentrance to Yorktown also noticed the\nsituation and rushed over. They were\noriginally going to surround the strange\nman whose whole body was wrapped in\nbandages, but they were all stunned when\nthey saw Fong Yu. \"Hey, bro, what's\ngoing on? Why are they attacking their\nown people?\" One of the players guarding\nthe gate asked Fong Yu. They knew the\nfour players who were attacked. They had\nrecently gone to the Cobalt Rift with\nSong Jimming to exchange for supplies.\nUpon hearing this, Fong Yu looked at the\ntwo players who were standing there\ndumbfounded and pale-faced and said\ncoldly, \"Will you tell me yourselves, or\nshall I?\" One of the more timid male\nplayers trembled as he tried to tell the\ntruth, but was stopped by the tall, thin\nplayer next to him. The tall, thin\nplayer glared at Fong Yu and said, \"What\ndid you say? This guy covered in\nbandages attacked us without saying a\nword. Why don't you ask him why he\nattacked us?\" At this moment, people\nfrom the town gradually arrived. Seeing\nmore and more people gathering around,\nFong Yu asked them, \"Did you go to the\nCobalt Rift with Song Jumming to trade\nsupplies?\" \"Yes.\" \"And then, what about\nSong Jimming?\" The tall thin man\nstubbornly insisted. Halfway through the\ntransaction, those cobalts suddenly\nattacked us. Song Jimming was captured,\nand we escaped back. \"Oh, are you sure?\"\nFong Yu asked, squinting at the tall,\nthin man. Of course, I'm sure. The tall,\nthin man continued lying. We wanted to\ncome back for reinforcements, but we ran\ninto this strange guy who even injured\ntwo of our companions. Ah, Fongu\nsneered. You guys really don't use your\nbrains. I've already asked you this, and\nyou still want to keep making excuses.\nWhat? What do you mean? Among you, is\nthere anyone who stabbed Song Jumming in\nthe back thinking he was dead? Upon\nhearing this, both the tall thin man and\nthe players standing to the side were\nshocked. They knew that Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s\nability to reveal this detail meant that\nSong Jimming was not dead. Didn't that\nmean the whole thing was exposed? But\nthings had come to this point, and in\nthe eyes of the tall, thin man, there\nwas no other way but to fight to the\nbitter end. You're lying. What evidence\ndo you have to prove that we stabbed\nhim? Evidence. Fong Yu raised an eyebrow\nand sneered. Don't worry, there will be\nevidence. At this moment, more and more\nplayers gathered around and Fong Yu\nsaid, \"Keep an eye on them. I'm going to\nrescue people.\" After saying that, he\nled Olivia and sped toward the Cobalt\nRift. Chapter 123. Resurrecting Song\nJaming. The tall thin man who vehemently\ndenied the allegations was named Xiao\nShaing. The reason he refused to admit\nit was because he was the one who\nstabbed Song Jimming. He clearly\nremembered that he stabbed Song Jimming\nin the lower back. And to ensure that\nSong Jimming would die, he deliberately\ntwisted the blade inside Song\nJimming&lt;unk&gt;s body twice. As a medical\nstudent, he knew that such a wound could\nnot be saved. Moreover, he saw Song\nJimming fall to the ground and close his\neyes. because he was nervous. Xiao\nXianing, who was killing for the first\ntime, did not look closely and hurriedly\nran away with his men. But now it seems\nthat Seong Jiming was faking his death\nat the time and sent a message to Fong\nYu after he left, which is why Fong Yu\nrushed over immediately and stopped\nthem. But so what? The people\naccompanying him were all in cahoots\nwith him. So even if Song Jimming posted\nthe truth on the public channel, it was\nuseless to him. He could easily say that\nthe cobalts suddenly attacked them,\ncaptured Song Jumming, and they had no\nchoice but to retreat first. However,\nthey were framed by the resentful Song\nJimming. This explanation is plausible.\nIn short, as long as Fong Yu cannot\nproduce substantial evidence, he is\nsafe. Unless Fong Yu dares to kill him\nindiscriminately. But if Fong Yu does\nthat, he will lose the trust of the\nplayers in King's Landing. Moreover,\nXiao Xiaing also realized that Song\nJiming was just a puppet supported by\nFong Yu, and Fong Yu didn't even know\nhim very well. So, he thought that Seong\nJiming&lt;unk&gt;s death was no big deal. He\nbet that Fong Yu wouldn't do something\nthat would anger the public for the sake\nof a dispensable puppet. Moreover, he\nhad a backup plan. On the other side,\nFongu arrived at the Cobalt Rift. From a\ndistance, there were no buildings on the\nground. Only a dozen brown-haired\ncobalts wandering around, seemingly on\nguard duty. As Fong Yu and Olivia\napproached, the cobalts on lookout duty\nspotted them and immediately charged at\nthem, howling as they brandished their\nwooden clubs, presumptuous. Upon seeing\nthis, Olivia, who was standing in front,\nimmediately shouted, and a dark green\nlion's head phantom bloomed from her\nchest, opening its blood red m and\nroaring at the cobalts. Upon seeing\nthis, the originally menacing cobalt\nstopped in their tracks in fright, and a\nfew of the more timid ones turned and\nfled with howls of pain. Tsk tisk. Fongu\nraised his eyebrows again, looking at\nOlivia's back and sighing. Could this be\nthe legendary true lion's roar? With\nOlivia's presence intimidating them, the\nCobalts dared not cause any more\ntrouble. With Olivia's translation, Fong\nYu successfully followed the Cobalts\ninto the Rift Valley and descended along\nthe rugged, winding path on the valley\nwall to a cave below. Along the way,\nFong Yu saw almost nothing related to\ncivilization, apart from a few campfires\nat the bottom of the valley and the\ngravel path under his feet that could\nbarely be called a road. The rest of the\nplace was completely natural. However,\nwhen Fong Yu entered the cave, he was\nstill surprised and his eyes widened.\nAlthough the cave looked very simple, it\nwas filled with a hazy golden light that\nalmost dazzled Fong Yu. Why is there\ngolden light? Because this cave was\nalmost entirely filled with dazzling\ngold. The gold was illuminated by\nhundreds of candles whose flickering\nlight cast a hazy golden glow over it.\nUpon closer inspection, most of the gold\nwas in its unrefined or state with a\nsmall portion roughly cut into small\ngold nuggets and hung on the cave walls.\nEven many of the cobalts in the cave had\nsome gold nuggets hanging on their\nbodies. It was clear that these cobalts\nhad a particular fondness for gold. As\nFong Yu walked deeper into the cave, he\nsaw more and more cobalts adorned with\ngold. Furthermore, the deeper one went\ninto the cave, the more candles appeared\naround them, and a strange oily smell\nbegan to permeate the air. Soon, led by\nthe cobalt guide, Fong Yu and Olivia\narrived at a secluded cave deep within\nthe mountain. Two burly cobalts, each\nwielding a golden spear, stood at the\ncave entrance, glaring fiercely at Fong\nYu and emitting low growls filled with\nwarning. Olivia was about to use the\nsame trick again, using the lion shadow\nto scare away the two cobalts, but Fongu\nstopped her. Fongu shook his head at\nOlivia and said, \"We're on their turf\nafter all, so let's keep a low profile.\nCan you translate for me? Just say I'm\nhere to see someone and also to make\nsome deals with the Cobalts.\" Olivia\nnodded and began translating. The tall,\ndoghe-headed guard grinned, seemingly\ndispleased, but he still put away his\nspear and turned to walk into the cave.\nA moment later, the guard came out\nagain, shouted, and stepped aside. So\nOlivia said to Fong Yu, \"We can go in\nnow.\" So the two of them went into the\ncave. As soon as Fong Yu entered the\ncave, he was once again taken aback\nbecause in the center of the cave stood\na huge golden throne that was nearly 2 m\ntall. This was also the only processed\ngold artifact that Fongu had seen since\nentering the cave. At this moment, an\nelderly cobalt wearing a crown on his\nhead was sitting on a golden throne\nlooking down at Fong Yu who had entered.\nIt seemed that this guy was the\nchieftain of this cobalt tribe. On the\nopen ground in front of the throne, Song\nJimming lay there silently. Woof woof\nwoof. The do-headed man on the throne\nsaid something. Olivia translated. It\nsays that this human wasn't killed by\nthem, but by our own people. Upon\nhearing this, Fong Yu immediately rushed\nto Seming&lt;unk&gt;s side and bent down to\nexamine him. A large pool of blood had\nspread beneath Song Jimming, whose face\nwas deathly pale. Fong Yu placed his\nfinger near Song Jimming&lt;unk&gt;s nose. He\nwas already lifeless. So Fong Yu put his\near to Song Jimming&lt;unk&gt;s chest and\nlistened for a moment. My heart seems to\nhave stopped beating. So this is truly\ndead. Fong Yu took a deep breath,\nsuppressing his anger, and looked up at\nthe cobalt on the throne, saying, \"I\nknow this is nothing to do with you, and\nI won't cause you any trouble.\" Olivia\ntranslated the past. The do-headed\nchieftain on the throne nodded and said\nsaid you can take the body, but our\npeople took thee or worth 150 pieces of\nmeat. This fat man only gave them 85\npieces of meat. So, they are still short\n65 pieces of meat. Without a word, Fongu\ntook out 65 pieces of pigheaded human\nflesh from his backpack and threw them\non the ground. Then he asked the\ndo-headed chieftain on the throne, \"It\nseems you really like gold.\" After\ncobalt chieftain nodded and replied with\nsomething. It says that gold is their\nfavorite thing besides food and also\ncandles. Candle? Indeed, besides gold,\nthe cave was filled with candles. Fong\nYu even noticed that the dogheaded\nchieftain had placed a candle on his\ngolden hat. Fongu thought for a moment\nand understood. For these cobalts who\nlived in caves and mine minerals\nunderground all year round, light source\nwas naturally extremely precious. Since\nthere was no such thing as electric\nlight in this world, candles naturally\nbecame their most beloved item. Fong Yu\nthen said, \"I have a lot of gold here,\nand it's even been processed in a\nhandiccrafts. I wonder if you'd be\ninterested.\" He had been worrying about\nwhat to do with the gold in the\nunderground palace vault, but now it had\na use. These cobalts were much better at\nmining than humans, and King's Landing\nwas currently under repair and needed a\nlot of stone. Simply trading food with\nthese cobalts wasn't a long-term\nsolution since the number of players in\nKing's Landing would increase, and the\nfood that the farmland outside the city\ncould provide was limited. After hearing\nthe translation, the do-headed\nchieftain, who had been slumped on his\nthrone, immediately sat up straight and\nstared at Fong Yu, barking. It said that\nif we had gold, they would trade it for\nanything except food and candles. At\nthis moment, Fong Yu, who was opening\nthe crafting interface to check the\ncrafting options, smiled slightly and\nsaid, \"Tell them that I can provide a\nlarge number of candles if they need\nthem.\" Yes, the systems crafting\ninterface directly shows how to make\ncandles, and they're even white grade.\nYou can make them without creating a\nblueprint, and the crafting requirements\nare simple. Just one part paraffin wax\nor one part oil plus wood ash plus one\npart cotton and you can make 10 candles.\nHe even went to the exchange to check\nthe prices of these materials and they\nweren't expensive. Upon hearing that\ncandles could also be provided. The\ncobalt chieftain immediately stood up\nfrom his throne with some excitement.\nLeaning on his naturally formed golden\ncane, he walked up to Fongu grinned and\nsaid something. Olivia who was standing\nnearby translated. It said that if we\ncan really provide golden candles, then\nwe will gain the eternal friendship of\nthe cobalts. Very good. Immediately,\nFong Yu had Olivia carry Jimming&lt;unk&gt;s\nbody, and the two walked out of the\ncave. After emerging from the cave, Fong\nYu looked around at the massive amount\nof rubble, rocks, and various ores that\nthe cobalts had dug out and smiled\nslightly. He hadn't expected that this\ntrip to rescue people would also lead to\nthe establishment of a new trade route.\nI'm a business genius. Moreover,\nwith this trade route in exchange for\nthe stone and minerals mined by the\ncobalts, the reconstruction of King's\nLanding will be much faster. A dozen\nminutes later, Fong Yu and Olivia\nreturned to the manor with Fattyong's\nbody and went to the manor cemetery. If\nwe just put him in there, will he be\nresurrected as an undead? Funu asked.\nOlivia nodded. Then let it go. So Olivia\nput Fatty Song into one of the open\ncoffins and closed the lid. To be\nhonest, Song Jimming&lt;unk&gt;s death really\naffected Fong Yu. He was someone Fong Yu\nhad arranged to stay in King's Landing\nto manage things, but he was murdered\nnot long after. He knew from the\nbeginning that someone would covet the\nposition of Lord, which is why he made\nSong jamming the lord. Laziness was only\none aspect. More importantly, it was to\navoid risks. Now look what happened. The\nrisk has indeed come and saning has died\nin his place. Although all of this was\nexpected, Fongu did not feel the joy of\nhaving everything under control.\nInstead, he felt a little regretful and\neven more so, a sense of impending doom.\nHe didn't kill Bun, but Boran died\nbecause of him. He had to avenge this.\nSoon, Fong Yu saw the entire coffin\nslowly sink into the ground, and a line\nof text appeared on the previously blank\ntombstone. Song Jimming was reincarnated\nin the lost era 9,01.\nJust then, the black statue in the\ncenter of the cemetery suddenly emitted\na dark green light, enveloping the\ncoffin that had sunk into the ground.\nThis beam of light lasted for about a\nminute before slowly disappearing. At\nthat moment, a series of muffled\nknocking sounds and shouts came from\ninside the coffin. Holy crap, where am\nI? Let me out. Hearing Song Pongs\nfamiliar voice, Fong Yu breathed a sigh\nof relief, and smiled slightly. He\nwalked to the coffin, pushed open the\nlid, and said to Song Jimming, who\nlooked completely bewildered inside,\n\"How does death feel?\" Upon seeing Fong\nYu, Song Jimming finally breathed a sigh\nof relief, sat up from the coffin, and\nexclaimed, \"Holy crap, brother Fong, you\nscared me half to death. I thought I was\nreally dead. You really were dead.\" Fong\nYu said earnestly, \"But I've brought you\nback to life.\" Upon hearing this, Song\nJimming paused slightly as if he had\nthought of something. He reached down\nand touched his lower back where a\nbloody hole still remained. In fact, his\nfingers could even reach inside the\nhole. In other words, the wound hasn't\nhealed, so why can't I feel any pain?\nSeeing Jimming&lt;unk&gt;s bewildered\nexpression, Fong Yu explained, \"You\nreally were dead. I've now resurrected\nyou as an undead.\" After standing there\nin a daysaze for a long time, Song\nJimming suddenly sighed, \"Ugh, I can't\nbelieve I died like this and in such a\npathetic way, stabbed in the back by my\nown teammate. It's so damn painful. Do\nyou want revenge? Fong Yu asked Seong\nJiming. Upon hearing the word revenge,\nFatty Song&lt;unk&gt;s face immediately\ncontorted with resentment. He gritted\nhis teeth and said, \"I want it. That\ndamn Xiao Xiaing. I'll kill him with my\nown hands.\" Fong Yu nodded and said,\n\"All right, I'll grant your wish.\" After\nsaying that, Fong Yu stood up and said\nto Song Jimming in the coffin, \"Get up.\nI'll take you to take revenge.\" So, Song\nJimming climbed out of the coffin and\nthen saw the surrounding cemetery and\nthe entire manor. Brother Fong, \"Where\nis this? It looks really creepy,\"\nFattyong whispered. Eerie Fongu glanced\naround upon hearing this. Indeed, the\nentire manor was nestled among the trees\nwith towering trees blocking most of the\nsunlight. Coupled with the nearby\ncemetery and the somewhat eerie looking\nwooden house in the middle, it did\nindeed appear rather gloomy. However,\nFong Yu, who had already gotten used to\nliving here, didn't care. He replied\nindifferently. This is my manner. Holy\ncrap. A manor? Yours? Fattyong\nexclaimed, his eyes wide. Brother Fong,\nyou already have your own manor. Is that\nstrange? Funu laughed. It was upgraded\nto a manor on the first day of spring,\nand it's already a twostar manor now.\nUpon hearing that this was Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s\nmanner, Song Jimming immediately felt\nthe urge to take a look around. However,\nbefore he could take two steps, a\nstrange purplish black tentacle suddenly\nemerged from the ground and wrapped\nitself around Song Jimming&lt;unk&gt;s thigh.\nSong Jimming looked down and was so\nfrightened he almost jumped out of his\nskin. Just as he was about to scream, he\nheard Fong Yu say from the side, \"Go\nback. These are our own people.\" Upon\nhearing this, Song Jming saw the strange\ntentacles wrapped around his thigh\nimmediately retract into the ground.\nStill shaken, Song Jimming dared not\nmove around carelessly. He cautiously\napproached Fong Yu and said, \"Brother\nFong, this manner of yours is too\nterrifying. How come there are such\nscary tentacles? Is it scary?\" Fong Yu\nsaid with a faint smile. There are even\nscarier things you haven't seen yet, but\nlet's leave it for today. Let's go and\nget your revenge first. After saying\nthat, Fong Yu led the resurrected Song\nJimming and Olivia toward Yorktown.\nChapter 124. Characteristics of the\nundead. On the way to the Yorktown\nruins, Fong Yu kept observing Song\nJimming beside him, trying to see if\nthere was anything unusual about him.\nAfter all, they were about to arrive in\nKing's Landing, and he didn't want other\nplayers to know that he had the ability\nto resurrect the dead. After all, in the\nminds of ordinary people, this ability\nis somewhat sinister and easily\ncriticized. However, after watching him\nfor a while, apart from his skin being a\nbit paler than before, San Jiming didn't\nseem to have any other problems. How do\nyou feel physically after being\nresurrected? Funu asked. Seeming touched\nhis upper body and said, \"It's not much\ndifferent from before, except that my\nsense of touch doesn't seem as sensitive\nas before. It doesn't hurt much when I\npinch myself and I don't feel tired even\nafter walking for so long. This is the\nadvantage of the undead. Fong Yu said in\nthe future when they encounter attacks,\ntheir resistance to damage and endurance\nwill be greatly improved. Moreover, as\nlong as they are not burned to ashes,\neven if they become skeletons, they will\nhave a chance to be resurrected. Holy\ncrap, that's that awesome. Fattyong\nexclaimed excitedly. Then he's\ninvincible. Invincible, huh? You're\noverthinking it, Fongu replied. If you\ndon't have the ability to fight back,\nyou're just a punching bag that can take\na beating. If you understand, then go\nfor purebred cows. That's not bad\neither. Song Jimming laughed. He I\noriginally thought these undead would be\nlike walking corpses, but now it seems\nthey are much better than walking\ncorpses. At this moment, Fun Yu pointed\nto Olivia walking in front and said,\n\"She is also an undead, and her combat\nability is off the charts. You can ask\nher for advice in the future. She can\nteach you a lot of useful things.\"\nFattyong glanced at Olivia's retreating\nfigure, then leaned close to Fong Yu and\nwhispered, \"I know that, a swordsman\nlevel expert. By the way, brother Fong,\nwhere did you get such a powerful\npartner?\" Fong Yu smiled slightly and\nsaid, \"Would you believe me if I said I\njust entered the game and woke up to\nfind her there? This works,\" Fatty Song\nexclaimed, his beady green eyes wide\nwith surprise. But she wasn't this\npowerful at first. She was just a\nskeleton. She gradually evolved into\nwhat she is now, and she'll probably\nbecome even stronger in the future. At\nthis point, Fong Yu patted Fatty Song on\nthe shoulder and said, \"So, you can also\ngradually level up and improve your\nstrength in the future.\" At this point,\nFong Yu suddenly realized something. \"By\nthe way, are you still a player? Do you\nstill need to use system abilities?\"\nSong Jamming was slightly taken aback\nupon hearing this. He stared blankly at\nthe air in front of him for a while,\npresumably opening the system interface.\nAfter a moment, he breathed a sigh of\nrelief and replied, \"It still works, and\nI'm still a player. But the race in the\npanel attribute bar has changed from\nhuman to undead.\" \"Holy crap, wait a\nminute.\" Suddenly, Fatty Song exclaimed\nin surprise, \"How come there's a master\noption now?\" \"Master?\" Fa, how did you\nbecome my master? Isn't that obvious?\nFun replied irritably. I'm the one who\nresurrected you. So theoretically,\nyou're now my servant. What? Not\nsatisfied? Fongu glanced at Fatty Song.\nHey, how could that be? Song Jimming\nquickly replied with a fawning smile.\nBrother Fong, you've already done me a\ngreat favor by saving my life. Not to\nmention that you've been recommending me\nto be the Lord. Actually, you should\nknow that when I recommended you to be\nthe Lord, it was just because I wanted\nto use you, Fong Yu said frankly. Now\nthat song Jimming had been recognized as\nhis servant by the game system, he could\nspeak his mind. Hearing Fong use\nfrankness, Song Jming was slightly\ntakenback, then laughed and said, \"He,\nof course, I know that. After all, we're\nall adults. No one is nice to someone\nwithout a reason. Besides, we weren't\nvery familiar with each other back then.\nYou wanted me to be the Lord just to\nsave some trouble and save that 5% tax.\nBut if I became the Lord, the benefits I\nwould gain would be enormous. So in the\nend, I'm the one who benefits the most.\nH you're not stupid after all. Of\ncourse. At this moment, Fong Yu suddenly\nchanged the subject and asked, \"Why did\nyou think of sending me the first\nmessage?\" Upon hearing this, Fattyong\nscratched his head and replied, \"I felt\nlike I was about to die at that time,\nand the first person I thought of who\ncould save me was you. So, I sent you a\nmessage. Why didn't you explain the\nsituation in the public chat channel or\nthe fan club group? Hey, I passed out\nright after sending you the message.\nThere was no time to send any more\nmessages. Song Jimming side. Oh, but now\nthat I think about it, it wasn't just\npassing out. It was more like I died. By\nthe way, brother Fong, what are you\ngoing to do with those guys when we get\nback? Fongu thought for a moment and\nreplied. When you had your previous\ndiscussion, did you set out any\npunishments for betraying your\nteammates? Yes, there is. But it's still\nunder discussion, and nothing has been\ndecided yet. All right, then. Let's get\nover there and kill those guys to scare\nthem a little. When they reached the\nriver, Fong Yu used Dance of the Wind to\nfly across while Fattyong was grabbed by\nthe collar and thrown across by Olivia.\nOlivia was willing to put up with the\ntreatment when he was treated like a\ncorpse. But now that he's alive, she\ncan't enjoy that treatment anymore.\nFortunately, after becoming an undead,\nthe fat man's physical resilience\nincreased by three levels. After flying\nmore than 10 m and falling to the\nground, he was as if nothing had\nhappened and immediately got up. Just as\nSanjming was about to continue walking\ntowards the Yorktown ruins, Fong Yu\nwaved his hand. Wait a moment. What's\nwrong, bro? Fattyang asked, puzzled.\nFong Yu was currently checking his\nfriend's messages. It was a message from\nLu Xiao Fang, the president of the\nsupport group. She said that a coup had\njust occurred in the town. Xiao Xianing,\ntogether with people from the Three\nKingdoms Heroes Association, and some\nmembers of the Donging Society, had\ntaken control of those who firmly\nsupport me. They are now setting a trap\nand waiting for me to arrive. Holy crap,\nthat bastard has so many tricks up his\nsleeve. Fattyang cursed. Shall we hurry\nand rescue them? No rush. Fa replied to\nLu Xiaoang&lt;unk&gt;s message while saying,\n\"I told them to play along with Xiao\nXianing for now to ensure their safety\nand then wait. Wait for what?\" A cold\nglint appeared in Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s eyes.\nWait and see who will choose to join his\ncamp. After they all jump out, I will\nwipe them all out in one fell swoop.\nTay, not to be rude, but Brother Fong is\nreally thoughtful. Fattyong flattered at\nthe opportune moment, but then\nimmediately added, \"But if too many\npeople join his side, I'm afraid we\nwon't be able to handle it. After all,\nthere are only three of us. What's there\nto be afraid of?\" Fong said calmly.\n\"They're just a bunch of rabble. Once we\ntake out the ring leaders, the others\nwon't dare to cause trouble.\" At this\npoint, he looked at Olivia, who was\nwalking ahead, and said, \"There's\nsomething else you might not know. The\nundead have a unique characteristic.\nWhat are its characteristics? That is,\nas long as a war breaks out, the number\nof friendly forces will increase.\nChapter 125. Ambush. On the city wall of\nthe Yorktown ruins, Xiao Xianing was\nsquatting behind the battlements,\nobserving every move outside. Beside\nhim, 20 players armed with bows and\narrows were crouching in ambush. In\naddition, 52 axmen were lurking in the\ncorner behind the entrance. Among them\nwere eight hunters, swordsmen, and\nspearmen who had changed their class.\nThese people lying in ambush were all\nwaiting for one person to appear, and\nthat was the guy named Fongu. Does he\nreally think he's invincible after\nbecoming a mage? It's ridiculous. We\nhave over 70 men here waiting for him.\nIf he dares to approach the city wall,\nwe'll make sure he doesn't leave alive.\nFor this reason, he even boasted that\nwhoever could personally kill Fong, you\nwould be supported as the lord of this\nregion. Although he himself had no\ncombat ability as a psychologist, he was\nvery clear about human greed. He was\ngood at using other people's greed to\nmake benefits for himself, which is why\nhe was able to gather a team of his own\nin this town with its complicated\ninterpersonal relationships in just 2\ndays. It must be said that Xiao\nXiangqing is a talent. In less than two\nhours, he used his silver tongue and the\nconnections he had made in advance to\nturn the tables on himself, who was\noriginally a prisoner, and take control\nof the key figures in the city. He also\nprepared ambushes and traps, waiting for\nFongu to walk into the trap. As long as\nI kill Fongu, I'll be safe. Not only\nsafe, but if I manage things properly\nfor the next 3 days, becoming the city\nlord shouldn't be a problem. And if I\nbecome the city lord, then the final\nposition of lord will most likely be\nmine. Just as Xiao Xianing was pondering\nthe next steps, an archer beside him\nsuddenly alerted him. He's here. He's\nhere. Southeast 10:00 position. He just\nemerged from the woods. Upon hearing\nthis, Xiao Xianqing immediately looked\nin the direction the archer had\nindicated, and sure enough, he saw a\nfigure wearing a full set of boar armor\nemerge from the woods in the direction\nof the cobalt rift. Wait a little\nlonger, let him get closer, and we can\nsee him more clearly, Ziao Xianing said\ncautiously. After all, Fongu wasn't the\nonly one in the game with the wild boar\nset. Soon, the figure wearing the wild\nboar armor slowly walked to the open\nspace in front of the city wall. Judging\nfrom his strange posture as he walked,\nhe seemed to be injured. Upon closer\ninspection, it was not hard to see that\nhis wild boar armor was stained with a\nlot of blood. Open the door. A figure in\nfront of the city wall shouted. And\nafter a day of emergency repairs, the\ncollapsed city gate of the ruined city\nwall has been rebuilt. I am Fongu. Upon\nhearing the other person's voice, Xiao\nXangqing&lt;unk&gt;s tightly furrowed brows\nfinally relaxed. Although he couldn't\nsee the other person's face clearly due\nto his high vantage point, he still\nrecognized Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s voice.\nTherefore, the person below the city\nwall must undoubtedly be Fong Yu. Then,\nXiao Xangqing revealed a sinister smile\nand said to the 20 archers beside him,\n\"Fire.\" As soon as he finished speaking,\nthe 20 archers hiding behind the\nbattlement stood up instantly and shot\narrows at the person standing in the\nopen space in front of the city gate. In\nthe blink of an eye, more than half of\nthe 20 arrows struck the figure. At the\nsame time, Xiao Xiaing shouted again,\n\"Continue! Second wave!\" 5 seconds\nlater, as the figure below the city gate\nknelt on the ground, a second wave of 20\narrows struck the man again, leaving him\ncovered in thorns like a hedgehog. And\nat this moment, the figure reluctantly\ncollapsed to the ground, lifeless. Upon\nseeing the fallen figure, the archers on\nthe city wall cheered. They all believed\nthat their arrow had killed Fong Yu.\nThey had previously agreed that if they\nhit the target at the same time, whoever\nhit the vital spot would be the one who\nkilled Fong Yu and would be supported as\nthe city lord. So, these archers saw a 1\nin20 chance of becoming the city lord.\nHow could they not be excited? Xiao\nXangqing glanced coldly at the cheering\narchers, turned and walked down the\nstairs. He ordered the axemen lying in\nambush behind the city gate to open it\nand then led the 50 odd axemen toward\nthe figure riddled with arrows. Xiao\nXaning was still a little uneasy until\nhe saw the guy's face clearly. Soon they\narrived at the corpse. Xiao Xianing, who\nwas in the lead, looked down and found\nthat the corpse was wearing a linen\nmask. Xiao Xaning felt a slight unease\nand had a bad feeling. So, he asked one\nof the players next to him to remove the\nmask from the corpse's face. Just as the\nplayer bent down and reached out to\nremove the mask, the corpse suddenly\nraised its left hand and grabbed the\nplayer's arm. Before anyone could react,\nthe corpse's other hand had already\nraised the iron axe in its hand and\naccurately chopped down on the player's\nneck. Snap! A dull thud of a knife or\naxe piercing flesh and shattering bone\nrang out and the head of the axe wielder\nflew off. A fountain of blood gushed\nfrom his neck, splattering the heads and\nfaces of the surrounding axe wielders.\nAh. The nearby axemen witnessing this\nbizarre and bloody scene screamed and\nturned to flee out of the encirclement.\nXiao Xianing seeing this also retreated\nimmediately but shouted to the axmen\naround him. He's not quite dead yet.\nKill him. Whoever kills him last will be\nthe city lord. Under Ziao Xangqing&lt;unk&gt;s\ninstigation, the axmen who originally\nwanted to escape also stopped in their\ntracks, raised their weapons again, and\nrushed towards Fong Yu, who was riddled\nwith arrows in the center of the\nencirclement. Having finally managed to\nsqueeze out of the encirclement, Xiao\nXiangqing was about to run back into the\ncity gate immediately. He sensed\nsomething was wrong. Something very\nwrong. How could a normal person\npossibly be able to suddenly lash out\nand injure someone after being shot\ndozens of times? That Fong Yu is\ndefinitely more than just a magician.\nSo, he planned to return to the city to\nensure his own safety first and then\ncome out after those axemen had\ncompletely killed Fong Yu. Just then,\nZiao Xianqing, who was running, suddenly\nfelt a slight stinging pain in his right\nankle. When he realized what was\nhappening, he felt his body suddenly\nlose its balance and fall heavily to the\nground due to the inertia of running.\nThen, Ziao Xanging felt the stinging\npain in his ankle turn into a piercing\npain, so painful that he couldn't help\nbut hug his right leg and scream loudly.\nOnly then did he realize that his right\nfoot had been cut off by something. Xiao\nXianing&lt;unk&gt;s screams quickly attracted\nthe attention of the axe wielders on the\nouter edge of the encirclement. They all\nturned to look at Xiao Xianqing, who was\nclutching his broken leg and howling in\nagony, not understanding how he had been\nattacked. At that moment, a barely\nperceptible distorted wave swept through\nthe air and an invisible wind blade\naccompanied by a sharp whistling sound\nsliced across the neck of a swordsman.\nThe next second, his head flew off and\nblood gushed out. Chapter 126. Political\ntactics. Killing is never something to\nbe happy about. So Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s\nprinciple is not to actively kill, but\nwhen faced with someone who wants to\nkill him, he will never hesitate to take\naction. Therefore, the wind blades\nreleased by Fongu were all aimed at the\nvital points of those sword and axemen,\nstriving to kill them with one blow.\nAllowing these people to die without\npain was Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s final act of\nmercy towards them. Fong Yu wasn't\ninside the encirclement. He was not far\nfrom it. Wearing an invisibility cloak,\ncalmly chanting the incantation of the\nwind blade, using these wind blades to\nreap the lives of these axemen. The poor\ndead guys probably didn't even know how\nthey died or who killed them. The person\nriddled with arrows in the encirclement\nwas actually Olivia wearing Fong Yu's\nwild boar armor. Her mission was to draw\nthe first wave of attacks and then\nfeigned death to lure out the ambushers\nin the city. As it turned out, this\ncounter ambush plan was very successful.\nIt not only lured out the axemen hiding\nbehind the city gate, but also brought\nout the mastermind Ziao Xianing. It\nseems that although Xiao Xianing can be\nconsidered resourceful, he is still\nsomewhat impatient. The axemen outside\nthe city gates are now lambs to the\nslaughter. Anyone who tries to escape\nwill be mercilessly reaped by Fong Yu's\nwind blades. To conserve his magic\npower, Fongu will try to control one\nwindb blade to kill four or five axmen.\nAlthough this will reduce the damage of\nthe wind blades, it is enough for these\nunsuspecting targets. Soon, the 52\nswordsmen outside the city were\nslaughtered by Fong Yu and Olivia in a\npinser attack from both inside and\noutside. The open ground was littered\nwith mutilated corpses. Then Fong Yu\nlooked at the archers standing on the\ncity wall. By this time, the archers on\nthe city wall had been terrified by the\nbloody scene outside the city and had\nall gone down the wall to hide inside\nthe city. But that didn't matter. Fongu\nhad already made sure that the people in\nthe city's support group remembered the\nidentities of those archers, as well as\nthe identities of some people in the\ncity who were responsible for\nsuppressing and guarding the support\ngroup. He would find those people one by\none and punish them later. Now what he\nneeds to do is make Song Jimming take\nrevenge himself. So he took off his\ninvisibility cloak, waved to the bushes\nnot far away, and Fatty Song came out of\nthe bushes. Fong Yu took a machete out\nof his backpack and handed it to Song\nJumming, saying, \"I promised you I'll\nlet you take revenge yourself.\" Song\nJimming glanced at the machete in his\nhand and walked over to Xiao Xaning, who\nwas still lying on the ground, clutching\nhis broken leg and wailing. Xiao Xanqing\nalso saw Song Jumming at this moment and\nhis face which was originally contorted\nwith pain instantly twisted with fear.\nYou you why aren't you dead? Impossible.\nImpossible. Song Jimming bent down and\nslashed Xiao Xian&lt;unk&gt;s thigh with his\nknife, gritting his teeth as he said,\n\"You're right. I was indeed killed by\nyou, you bastard. But I've come back to\nlife. I'm back to take revenge on you,\nyou bastard.\" With that, Seming raised\nhis knife and slashed Xiao Xiaing&lt;unk&gt;s\narm again. Ah! Xiao Xianing&lt;unk&gt;s\nagonizing screams reached Song\nJimming&lt;unk&gt;s ears, turning into a sense\nof vengeful pleasure. He raised his\nmachete again, wanting to finish off the\nold bastard who had stabbed him in the\nback, but in the end, he slowly lowered\nthe machete. Seeing this, Fongu frowned\nand asked, \"What? You wouldn't actually\nhave any sympathy for someone like this,\nwould you? It's not out of kindness.\nSong Jiming shook his head and said, \"I\nwant to spare his life for now. And\nafter the rebellion in the town is\nquelled, gather everyone together and\npublicly try him for his crimes, then\nexecute him as a warning to others. This\nway, it can serve as a model for the\nmanagement of the town and the\nformulation of laws and regulations.\"\nFong Yu raised an eyebrow upon hearing\nSon Jimming&lt;unk&gt;s words, then smiled and\nexclaimed, \"He fatty, you've really\nimpressed me. Sigh, it's&lt;unk&gt; all\nbecause you wanted me to be the Lord,\nbrother Fong. Since I'm going to be the\nLord, I can't just think about things\nfrom my own perspective. I have to\nconsider the bigger picture.\" Fattyong\nstood up from the ground, handed the\nmachete back to Fong Yu, and said,\n\"Anyway, I can't let you down, brother\nFong, right?\" Fong Yu smiled and looked\nat the pale-faced, somewhat simple-l\nlookinging fat man in front of him,\nnodding and saying, \"I knew I hadn't\nmisjudged you.\" Fong Yu then took out a\nrotten cane and had Fatty Song tie up\nZiao Xianing&lt;unk&gt;s hands and feet to\nprevent him from escaping. Fong Yu also\ndeliberately crushed the guy's other leg\nand then had Fattys watch over it. At\nthis moment, Olivia also came to Fong\nYu&lt;unk&gt;s side carrying a blood dripping\niron axe and said calmly, \"What do we do\nnext?\" Fong Yu glanced in the direction\nof the city gate and said, \"Enter the\ntown and quell the rebellion.\" Upon\nentering the town, Fongu heard shouts of\nbattle coming from all directions, and\nthere were even many players fighting in\nthe streets. It seems that the\nsupporters and those who support Fong Yu\nhave also received the news and have\nbegun to rebel against the traitors from\nwithin. This was something Fong Yu had\narranged in advance with Lu X Yao Fang\nand the fans in the support group. When\nhe cleared the ambush at the door, he\nnotified the people inside to start\norganizing a counterattack. All the\nplayers in Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s camp had a vine\nwrapped around their arms to distinguish\nthemselves from their allies. So Fong Yu\nwasn't worried about killing the wrong\nperson. He then ordered Olivia to charge\ninto the chaotic crowd while Fong Yu\nraised his wand and summoned a 3 m long\nfire dragon charging towards the rebels.\nHalf an hour later, under the joint\noperation of Fong Yu, Olivia and Allied\nforces, the rebels in the town ruins\nwere completely wiped out. Most of these\nrebels were killed and only a small\nnumber of rebels who surrendered were\ncollectively driven to the square in the\ncenter of the town and put under guard.\nThe statistics are in. Seeing ran up to\nFong Yu and reported a total of 525\nplayers participated in this rebellion,\nmainly from the Three Kingdoms Heroes\nAssociation and the Dong Society. The\nnumber may not be accurate because some\nescaped by climbing over the wall and\nsome defected at the last minute, but\nthat's roughly the gist. Based on the\ncorpses, we killed 379 rebels, lost 75\nteammates, and 146 rebels surrendered\nand are being held in the square. Now,\nthere are 843 people in the whole town\nwho belong to our side. Fongu was\nstanding on a high platform beside the\nsquare, looking down at the kneeling\nprisoners, and asked, \"What do you plan\nto do with these people?\" Lu X Yaoang\nand Xiao Yini mean that many of those\npeople were forced to join the rebels.\nAlthough they are despicable, they are\nunderstandable. So they want to drive\nthem out of here and let them f for\nthemselves. Song Jimming whispered.\nThere were originally five teams in the\nruins. The largest was the Fong Yu\nsupport group whose president was Lu\nXiao Fang, who was also one of the\ndeputy city lords. Xiao Yini was the\npresident of the women's federation and\nalso one of the deputy city lords who\nfirmly supported Fong Yu. So their\nopinions should be respected. So what do\nyou mean? Fonu glanced at Fatty Song. If\nyou ask me, we should just kill them\nall. Fatty Song said through gritted\nteeth. They're all a bunch of insatiable\ningrates. We've worked so hard to build\nthis place, and these guys almost\ndestroyed it all in their struggle for\npower. Well, Lu Xiao Fang and Xiao Yini\nare women, so it's understandable that\nthey're a bit soft-hearted. But just\nletting all of them go like this doesn't\nseem right. After a moment's thought,\nFong Yu replied, \"Here's what we'll do.\nGo and tell the surrendered rebels to\nidentify all the masterminds and then\nlet them deal with them themselves.\"\nSong Jimming was slightly takenback upon\nhearing this, then slapped his forehead\nin sudden realization and exclaimed,\n\"Holy crap. I get it. I get it,\nbrother.\" Fong, your trick is brilliant.\nLet them deal with their own people.\nThat way, the hatred will be transferred\nto their own ranks. Fong Yu ignored\nFatty Songs flattery and continued, \"As\nfor the rest of the people, don't let\nthem go out to fend for themselves.\nPunish them by making them build houses\noutside the city to live in. If these\npeople make enough contributions after\n12 days and do not cause any more\ntrouble, then we can consider accepting\nthem. Why not drive them away?\" Fattyong\nasked curiously. Fong Yu sighed and\nsaid, \"Driving them away would\ncompletely push them to the opposite\nside of us. Rather than that, it would\nbe better to keep them under our\nwatchful eyes and give them a glimmer of\nhope. That is the best way to eliminate\npotential threats. After listening, Song\nJimming nodded repeatedly and said,\n\"Yes, that's right. That makes sense.\"\nTo be honest, Brother Fong, you know,\nit's a real pity you're not a lord.\nFongu rolled his eyes and replied, \"I\ndon't want to be a lord simply because I\nfind it troublesome. I know a thing or\ntwo about political maneuvering.\"\nChapter 127. Centripal force and sense\nof belonging. Fongu did not participate\nin the final trial of the group of\nrebellious players in the square. He\nsimply stood on the high platform and\nobserved the entire trial process. This\ntrial was similar to a court trial in\nancient Rome with the three city lords\nand deputy city lords. Sanjiing, Lu\nXiaoang, and Xiao Yini serving as the\npresiding judges. The lawyer Jeang Wei\nread out the crimes of the rebellious\nplayers. Since there were no specific\nlegal provisions, the provisions related\nto treason were used as references. In\nshort, the process was long, primitive,\nand complicated, making Fong Yu drowsy,\nand wanting to quietly leave several\ntimes. But he knew he couldn't leave.\nEven if he didn't attend, he still had\nto stand on this high platform so that\nthe people in the square could see him,\nespecially the rebel players. Only then\nwould the rebels not dare to make a\nfinal desperate move. That's what you\ncall deterrence. After nearly 2 hours of\ntrial, the town's residents voted to\nconfirm the crimes of the rebellious\nplayers. The final verdict was the one\nFong Yu had provided to Song Juming,\nwhich led the rebellious players to\naccuse 13 ring leaders of inciting the\nrebellion and execute them. The\nexecutioners were the very people who\nhad made the accusations as a reward for\nthose who report wrongdoing. These\nindividuals are exempt from punishment\nand allowed to remain in the city, but\nare barred from running for any\nadministrative position for 5 years.\nOther rebellious players can choose to\nhave their resources confiscated and be\nexiled or build their own houses outside\nthe town walls and live there for 3\nyears before being allowed to return to\nthe town. Many towns people were still\ndissatisfied with the decision,\nbelieving the punishment was too lenient\nand suggesting that it be increased. At\nand told everyone that this was also\nFong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s intention, hoping to give\nthese people who had gone astray a\nchance. Upon hearing this, the\ndissatisfied town's people had no choice\nbut to back down, while the rebellious\nplayers in the square, who had received\nlighter sentences, cast grateful glances\nat Fong Yu on the high platform. It must\nbe said that song Jimming&lt;unk&gt;s last\nmove was a brilliant touch, dissolving\nthe last bit of hatred that the\nsurviving rebel players harbored towards\nFongu. The trial then moved into its\nfinal stage, the execution of the death\npenalty. This is the part that all the\ntown's people look forward to the most.\nIt seems that from ancient times to the\npresent, people have been very keen to\nwatch the execution of such a death\nsentence. So when the 13 masterminds\nwere brought to the square and the\nperson who reported them held a knife to\ntheir necks, the surrounding players\nerupted in cheers. Kill them. Kill these\nbastards. Yes, you heartless ingrate. He\ndeserves to die. Amidst the curses of\nthe onlookers, the 12 whistleblowers\nbrandished machetes and killed the 12\nring leaders of the rebellion. The last\none remaining was Xiao Xangqing, the\nmastermind behind the rebellion. It was\nSong Jumming who carried out the death\npenalty on Zhiao Xanging because\neveryone knew that Xiao Xangqing had\nstabbed Song Jimming in the back, nearly\nkilling him. Yes, Song Jimming didn't\nreveal that he was an undead. He only\nsaid that he was stabbed and seriously\ninjured and was eventually saved by Fong\nYu. After all, the identity of being an\nundead could easily provoke two extreme\nreactions from the town's people. It was\neither fear and alienation from those\nwho were different or a longing to\nbecome an undead. Either emotion was\ntroublesome, so they simply hid it. In\nthe end, Song Jiming got his wish and\nplunged a dagger into Xiao\nXangqing&lt;unk&gt;s chest, killing the man\nwho almost became a powerful figure and\nending the trial. Seeing that everything\nhad settled down, Fong Yu stepped down\nfrom the platform, intending to say\ngoodbye to Fatty Song before leaving.\nHowever, he was unexpectedly surrounded\nby a large number of towns people.\nLooking at the town's people whose eyes\nwere shining as they looked at him like\nhe was an idol. Funu felt a little\nembarrassed. He was not used to being\nthe center of attention and wanted to\nturn around and leave, but he was\nstopped by Lu Xaoang and Xiao Yini who\nwere in charge. Lu Xiaoang is a very\nenthusiastic and energetic girl. She\nlooks to be in her early 20s. She is\nquite capable and speaks in a\ndownto-earth manner. She seems to have\ncome from a rural area and is very\napproachable. Xiao Yini, on the other\nhand, is a slightly plump woman, also in\nher early 20s, but she speaks and acts\nrationally and methodically, seemingly a\nhighly educated woman, which explains\nwhy she would establish a women's\nfederation. \"Brother Fong, we owe this\nrebellion mainly to you. Could you say\nsomething to everyone?\" Lu Xiao Fang\nsaid enthusiastically to Fong Yu.\nSpeaking in public was something Fong\nYu, who suffered from mild social\nanxiety, was somewhat hesitant and\nreserved about. He instinctively wanted\nto refuse, but seeing the town's\npeople's eager eyes, he could only grit\nhis teeth, clear his throat, and say,\n\"It's not easy for anyone to survive in\nthis perilous world, and it's even\nharder to come together to live and\nbuild this town. I hope everyone\ncherishes the life they have now. You\nshould also know that this is only the\nbeginning of the game. After the next 3\ndays of winter, the servers will be\nmerged. At that time, we will not only\nhave to face the perilous environment\naround us, but we may also have to deal\nwith the invasion of players from other\nservers. If we cannot unite, our fate\nmay be very grim. At this point, Fong Yu\npaused, then said with a serious\nexpression, \"Our goal is the same. To\ncreate a safe, happy, and peaceful town,\na haven for everyone in this cruel world\nof survival. I will do my best to\nprotect everyone, and I hope we can work\ntogether.\" Immediately, led by Song\nXing, Lu Xiao, Fang, and Xiao Yini, all\nthe towns people began to applaud\nenthusiastically and even cheer.\nAlthough the speech was somewhat hastily\nput together, Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s words were\nsincere and resonated with the town's\npeople, everyone is just struggling to\nsurvive in this bizarre world. All they\nwant is to live and then on that basis\nlive a better and safer life. Now this\nruin is a hard one safe haven. As long\nas they can establish the town, they\nwill be free from the fearful wilderness\nlife they had at the beginning, which is\nwhat everyone hopes for. Now those\nrebellious players who were blinded by\ngreed and wanted to pursue power have\nbeen purged. The remaining players are\nnot all good people, but they all have a\nbasic ability to distinguish between\ngood and evil. With such a group of\npeople as the foundation, the\npossibility of major problems arising is\nnot high. Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s final words, \"I\nwill protect everyone,\" reassured the\ntown's people. After this suppression of\nthe rebellion, they truly witnessed Fong\nYu&lt;unk&gt;s strength. The fire dragon\nalone, capable of burning everything,\nhad already shocked everyone. Not to\nmention, he also had a mysterious\nservant who could fight against a 100\nmen single-handedly. This powerful\ncombat ability gave the town's people a\nstrong sense of security. In this\nperilous world of survival, a sense of\nsecurity is more important than anything\nelse. Only then did the town begin to\nhave a real sense of cohesion, and the\ntown's people began to feel a sense of\nbelonging. Chapter 128, The Dragon\nKnights Attack. After delivering his\nspeech, Fong Yu quickly made an excuse\nto slip away, fearing that the town's\npeople would try to get him to speak\nagain for various reasons or even\nreelect him as city lord or even lord.\nBut before Fong Yu could break out of\nthe town's people's encirclement, a loud\nbang suddenly came from the town gate.\nBoom! The city gate, which was over 4\nmeters high, collapsed with a crash, and\na huge figure crawled into the city\nthrough the gate opening. Upon seeing\nthat enormous figure, players familiar\nwith Western fantasy immediately widened\ntheir eyes and screamed in terror, \"A\ndragon! It's a giant dragon! Dragon!\nRun! It's all over! The dragon is\ncoming!\" In an instant, hundreds of\npeople were in an uproar and scattered\nin all directions. Fun Yu standing in\nthe crowd frowned and immediately took\nout his staff, beginning to apply\nvarious buffs to himself. Those who come\nwith ill intentions will not come. Those\nwith good intentions will not come. It\nseems that another tough battle is about\nto begin. But why would a dragon\nsuddenly appear here? Could it be that\nit knows a large number of humans have\ngathered here, so it came looking for\nfood? That's not a dragon. Olivia's\nvoice came from behind. Not a dragon.\nFong Yu turned to look at Olivia behind\nhim and asked, \"Then what is that thing?\nIt's an earth dragon, a type of\nsubdragon. It doesn't have wings and is\nmuch smaller.\" \"Earth dragon?\" Fong Yu\nturned his head and examined the dragon\nin the direction of the city gate again.\nHe then realized that the dragon was\nindeed on all fours and looked more like\na giant lizard about seven or 8 m long,\nincluding its head and tail. \"Can you\nbeat them?\" Funu asked again. Olivia\nstared at the slowly crawling earth\ndragon in silence for a while, then\nslowly nodded and said, \"This Earth\ndragon should have just been born. We\nstill have a chance to defeat it. What\nare the chances?\" \"20%.\"\n20%. Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s eyes widened. Then he\nasked, \"What about me?\" Olivia took the\niron axe from behind her back and slowly\nreplied, \"Including you, the odds are\nonly 20%. If you stay further away, the\nodds would be 30%.\nThat really hurts, buddy. Upon hearing\nOlivia's words, Fong Yu quickly called\nout to Fatty Song and Lu Xiao Fang,\ninstructing them to retreat deeper into\nthe town and find cover. Immediately,\nFong Yu transferred all the pre- battle\nbuffs he had originally intended to\napply to himself to Olivia. Olivia\nglanced at the magical light emanating\nfrom her body and said calmly, \"My\ncurrent win rate is about 40%.\"\nEven so, the win rate is only 40%, which\nshows how terrifying that Earth Dragon\nis. Before long, the Earth Dragon had\nclimbed up the road in the center of the\ntown to the square in the center of the\ntown, and a furious shout rang out. Fong\nYu, get the hell out here. Huh? This\nearth dragon can talk. Fong Yu, who had\njust climbed to the high platform, was\nslightly takenback. He turned his head\nto look at the giant dragon in the\nsquare below the platform. Only then did\nhe realize that there was a human\nsitting on the back of the earth dragon\nholding a long spear in one hand and a\nshield in the other since it can call\nout its own name. It must not be a\nnative of the game but a player. At this\nmoment, Fongu suddenly remembered that\nsomeone in the chat channel a few days\nago had said that a lucky player had\nfallen off a cliff, landed in a cave,\nand obtained a dragon egg and the dragon\nknight's legacy. Could this be the guy\nin front of me? But that doesn't make\nsense. Wasn't the story about getting a\ndragon egg? How could it have grown this\nbig in just a few days? That's\noutrageous. Could it be that he has had\nsome other extraordinary encounters?\nJust as Fong Yu was surprised, the man\non the back of the earth dragon shouted\nagain, \"Fong Yu, you little thief, where\nhave you been hiding? You dared to kill\nmy brothers, but you don't have the guts\nto come out and fight me oneon-one.\"\nJust then, Olivia stepped out from the\nedge of the square and said coldly,\n\"Those who insult my lord shall die.\"\nThe man on the dragon's back looked at\nthe tall figure walking onto the square,\ndressed in wild boar armor. He initially\nthought it was Fong Yu, but upon hearing\nthe voice, he realized it was a woman.\nHis weary gaze turned contemptuous. It's\na woman. Get lost. I don't kill women.\nThe man on the dragon's back roared.\nFongu, you bastard. Are you even a man?\nYou actually sent a woman to take a\nbullet for you. You're not a real man.\nUpon hearing this, Olivia's eyes flashed\nwith murderous intent, and she charged\ntowards the Earth Dragon with her iron\naxe in hand. The 7 to 8 m long Earth\nDragon looked at Olivia charging towards\nit. And like its master, a hint of\ncontempt flashed in its amber eyes. It\nraised its huge forpaw, ready to crush\nthis ignorant human to death with one\nswipe. At this moment, many players were\nsecretly watching the battle that had\njust begun in the ruins surrounding the\nsquare. Although they had witnessed the\nvaliant fighting prowess of the woman\nwearing bore armor as she slashed at the\nrebels, no one had any hope that she\ncould defeat the Earth Dragon. Because\nthis is no longer a difference in\nstrength, but a chasm between races.\nPutting everything else aside, the Earth\ndragon's entire body is covered in dense\nmetallic looking scales that look like\nthey can't be broken by an iron axe.\nThat guy wrapped in bandages and\nwielding an axe. Judging by his figure,\nhe looks like a woman, right? Tsk tsk.\nSuch a good figure. It's a shame he\ndied. A player who had recently arrived\nin Yorktown said regretfully. However, a\nmale player standing nearby retorted,\n\"Huh? You're overthinking it. Do you\nknow who that bandaged woman is? I heard\nshe's a powerful warrior at the\nswordsman level. Holy crap. A swordsman?\nReally? The new player exclaimed.\nOtherwise, do you think those hundred or\nso traitors were defeated by boss Fong\nYu. I was close to the city gate and saw\nit all clearly. That bandaged woman was\nholding an iron axe and hacked her way\nfrom the city gate to the center of the\ntown. She didn't even blink. Damn, bro.\nDon't brag. How could your eyes not be\ndry after cutting for so long? Hey, that\nlast sentence was just an exaggeration.\nWhy are you arguing with me about it?\nJust as the onlookers were discussing\nthe incident, to the player's surprise,\nthe female warrior in the square\nnimblely dodged the Earth Dragon's\nclaws, then suddenly leaped, using the\nEarth Dragon's front claws as a\nspringboard for a double jump, flying\ndirectly to the Earth Dragon's head. To\neveryone's astonishment, she raised her\niron axe and slammed it down on the\nEarth Dragon's forehead. Thump! A dull\nthud rang out, and Olivia used the\nrebound to perform a backflip and land\nsmoothly. While the Earth Dragon in\nfront of her began to shake its head and\nhiss in pain. As the Earth Dragon\ncontinued to shake its head, a large\namount of crimson dragon blood was\nsplattered on the square. To everyone's\nshock, a deep 30 cm long gash was\nactually cut into the Earth Dragon's\nforehead. Olivia didn't stop after\nlanding. Taking advantage of the Earth\nDragon's painful head shaking, she\nraised her ax again and charged towards\nthe Earth Dragon. This time, her goal\nwas to circle around to the side of the\nEarth Dragon and attack its abdomen\nbecause she knew that the Earth Dragon's\nweakest point was its abdomen, where the\nscales were sparse and there were no\nother hard parts. Olivia quickly moved\nto the side of the earth dragon, ax in\nhand, and charged towards the exposed\nbelly of the dragon. But at that moment,\nthe dragon knight riding on the dragon's\nback also spotted her. He immediately\nturned his spear around and shouted at\nOlivia, \"Dragon Fong thrust.\" Then the\ndragon knight kicked off the dragon's\nback and charged towards Olivia with his\nspear tip pointed directly at her.\nSeeing her attack route blocked by the\nDragon Knight and his spear aimed\ndirectly at her, Olivia had no choice\nbut to turn around and dodge to the\nleft, avoiding the Dragon Knight's\nthrusting spear tip. At the same time,\nshe threw the iron axe in her right hand\nto her left and swung it at the Dragon\nKnight's vulnerable abdomen. If it hit,\nthe Dragon Knight would surely be\ndisembowled. But the Dragon Knight\nimmediately realized Olivia's intention\nand used his left-hand diamond-shaped\nshield to block between his chest and\nabdomen. Clang. A clang of metal rang\nout as the iron axe struck the shield,\nfailing to pierce the Dragon Knight's\nabdomen. However, the immense impact\nstill disrupted the Dragon Knight's\nsteps, sending him flying backward.\nOlivia seized the opportunity to close\nin, preparing to finish off the dragon\nknight with her iron ax the moment he\nfell to the ground and stiffened. Just\nthen, Olivia felt a sharp whooshing\nsound behind her. She knew that the\nEarth Dragon must have reacted and was\nattacking her. Olivia had no choice but\nto give up the chance to kill the dragon\nknight and leaped forward to dodge the\nclaw attack of the Earth Dragon behind\nher. After Olivia landed with a clean\nroll, she regained her footing. The\nfallen dragon knight also stood up and\nraised his spear at Olivia. The earth\ndragon, its head covered in blood,\nglared at Olivia with its bloodshot\neyes, white smoke billowing from its\nnostrils. Now the real battle is about\nto begin. Chapter 129. Subduing the\ndragon knight. As the dragon knight\ncharged toward Olivia with his lance and\nthe earth dragon, a long dragon made of\nflames rose from a high platform not far\naway and rushed straight toward the\nearth dragon in the square. The earth\ndragon immediately sensed the sudden\nattack of the fire dragon, turned its\nhead away, and took the impact of the\nfire dragon with its back. Olivia took\nthe opportunity to dodge the Dragon\nKnight's dragon tooth thrust and\nprepared to use the same trick again,\ngetting close to the Dragon Knight's\nbody to attack. However, this time, the\nDragon Knight was on guard and\nimmediately raised a shield to charge at\nthe approaching Olivia. Shield bash.\nThis is the Dragon Knight's second melee\nskill. If the target is hit by the\nshield bash, they will be knocked back\nor stunned for one second. Olivia seems\nto be very familiar with the Dragon\nKnight skills. Facing the incoming\nshield, she flipped her ax blade and\nused the axe as a hammer to strike the\nshield. Thump. The immense impact\nsuccessfully shattered the dragon\nknight's shield bash skill, and Olivia\nwas also pushed backward by the recoil.\nAt the same time, the flames on the\nEarth Dragon's back quickly went out,\nleaving only a black scorch mark.\nAlthough it looked like it had been\nseriously injured, it was actually only\nthe surface scales that were damaged.\nThe dragon scales have extremely high\nresistance to both magic and physical\nattacks, and a mid-level spell, fire\ndragon, could not seriously damage it.\nAlthough it couldn't seriously injure\nthe Earth Dragon, the Fire Dragon spell\nstill hurt it. The burning pain on its\nback was even greater than the wound on\nits forehead. This also drew the Earth\nDragon's attention to the high platform\nnext to it. It saw a person standing on\nthe platform and a second fire dragon\nwas rising from the person's head and\nflying towards it. Faced with this long\nrange magical attack, the Earth Dragon\nhad no choice but to use its strongest\ndefensive back to defend itself again.\nAfter the second wave of fire dragon\nattacks, even the Earth Dragon with\nextremely high magic resistance could\nnot withstand it. The scales on its back\nhad been carbonized in large areas. As\nthe Earth Dragon trembled in pain, its\nskin cracked and a large amount of blood\nflowed down. A woo! The Earth Dragon\nroared in pain, abandoning the dragon\nknight's combined attack on Olivia. With\na roar, it turned and charged towards\nthe high platform, intending to tear\napart the human who had burned it with\nflames. Seeing the Earth Dragon turn and\ncharged towards him, Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s lips\ncurled into a cold smile. His goal was\nto lure the Earth Dragon away from the\nDragon Knight because the Dragon\nKnight's individual strength was\nactually far inferior to Olivia's. If it\nweren't for the Earth Dragon protecting\nhim, Olivia would have killed him long\nago. Now, with her two fire dragon\nspells taunting her, the Earth Dragon\ndisregarded its master's safety and\nattacked her, giving Olivia the\nopportunity to kill the Dragon Knight.\nAs expected, Olivia, a seasoned warrior,\nimmediately understood Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s\nintention. So, when the Dragon Knight,\nthrust his spear at her again, she no\nlonger dodged. Instead, she let the\nspear pierce her abdomen. Taking\nadvantage of the Dragon Knight's\nmomentary days, she closed the distance\nbetween them, raised her iron ax, and\nchopped at the Dragon Knight's neck. In\nhis panic, the Dragon Knight was forced\nto discard his spear and use his shield\nto block Olivia's attack. At the same\ntime, the Earth Dragon crashed into the\nwooden platform. With a violent tremor,\nthe platform collapsed. However, Fong\nYu, using the wind magic dance of the\nwind, leaped into the air, and landed on\nthe square. At this moment, the dragon\nknight in the square, having lost his\nspear, could only use his shield to\nblock Olivia's heavy blows from the iron\naxe. He couldn't understand how a woman\nwith a spear piercing her abdomen could\nstill have such strength to deliver a\ndeadly series of blows to him. Helpless,\nhe could only shout for the earth dragon\nto come back and help. However, at that\nmoment, a dagger appeared from behind\nthe dragon knight and was held to his\nneck. Don't move. Move again and you'll\ndie. Hearing the call, the Earth dragon\nturned to look at the plaza and saw its\nmaster with a dagger held to his neck.\nAngry and anxious, it wanted to rush\nover to save its master, but then it\nheard its master shout, \"Don't come any\ncloser.\" For a moment, the Earth Dragon\nstood there stunned. \"Very good.\" Fongu\nscraped the dragon knight's neck with\nthe dagger in his hand and said, \"Throw\naway the shield.\" Although the Dragon\nKnight was unwilling, he did as he was\ntold. If you don't want to die, send\nyour dragon out of the city. The Dragon\nKnight hesitated for a moment, but still\nloudly commanded the Earth Dragon to\ncrawl towards the city gate. Only after\nthe Earth Dragon crawled out of the city\ngate did Fong Yu put away his dagger,\nkick the Dragon Knight over, and knock\nthe shield out of his hand. The reason\nFong Yu didn't kill the Dragon Knight\nimmediately was because he was afraid\nthat if the Dragon Knight died, the\nEarth Dragon would go berserk, and it\nwould be difficult for him and Olivia to\nkill the Earth Dragon without paying a\nprice. To be honest, he had witnessed\nthe ferocity of this Earth Dragon. If it\nhadn't underestimated Olivia's attack\npower at the beginning, allowing Olivia\nto get close and strike it with an axe,\nit would have been difficult for Olivia\nto get close to it. His strongest fire\ndragon technique could only inflict some\nsuperficial wounds on the Earth Dragon,\nand if the fight continued, the outcome\nwas truly uncertain. Therefore, he could\nonly force the Earth Dragon to submit by\nsubduing the Dragon Knight. At this\nmoment, Olivia had also drawn the spear\nfrom her abdomen, and with an iron axe\nin hand, she came to the Dragon Knight's\nside, looking at him coldly. Seeing that\nthe situation was under control, Fun Yu\nsheathed his dagger. After carefully\nanalyzing the situation, he looked down\nat the dragon knight on the ground and\nasked, \"You just said that I killed your\nbrothers from the three kingdoms heroes\ngathering. Then who are you?\" Seeing\nthat the situation was hopeless, the\ndragon knight could only reply angrily.\n\"I am Lie Chunlong, the president of the\nThree Kingdoms Heroes Association.\"\n\"Lean Long,\" Fongu raised an eyebrow\nslightly. He remembered the name. In the\nfirst few days of the game, this guy was\none of the few players who were willing\nto share survival information. Funu\nactually had a pretty good impression of\nhim. You didn't participate in this\nrebellion before? Fongu asked again.\nWhat rebellion? Lie and long frowned.\nAll I know is that my brothers\ndiscovered a very good town ruin which\nis here. They wanted to establish a\nsettlement here, but you took it. Then\nyou killed my vice president without\neven asking any questions. and today you\nslaughtered my members. Fongu was silent\nfor a moment, then frowned and asked\nagain, \"Who told you all these things?\"\n\"Of course, it's&lt;unk&gt; the brothers in\nour guild. Is the vice president you're\ntalking about the one with the big\nbeard?\" \"Yes, you admitted.\" \"Huh?\"\nFongu sneered, then asked. \"Then why did\nit take you so long to arrive?\" asked\nthe president. \"I was only able to\nescape today because I was trapped on a\ncliff.\" Sigh. Fong Yu sighed. If I said\nyour brothers were lying to you, would\nyou believe me? You're talking nonsense.\nLie and Long shouted, \"My brothers have\nsworn an oath of brotherhood with me,\nthey wouldn't lie to me. Kill them or do\nwhatever you want with them. But don't\ninsult my brothers any further. I didn't\nrealize you were such a man,\" Fongu said\nwith a slight smile. \"But unfortunately,\nyou're a bit stupid. What did you say?\"\nUpon hearing this, Liin Long immediately\ntried to get up from the ground, but\nOlivia kicked him down again. At this\nmoment, Fong Yu pointed to Song Juming,\nLu Xiaoang, and the others who were\nrunning towards him and said to Li Chan\nLong, \"Let them explain to you.\" After a\nshort while, with the explanation from\nSong Juming, and the others, and the\nconfessions from the members of the\nThree Kingdoms Heroes Association who\nhad been spared, Li Chun finally learned\nthe whole story. Perhaps Song Jimming\nand the others were lying. But after the\nmembers of the Three Kingdoms Heroes\nAssociation came forward to testify,\nLiechin Long realized that he had been\ndeceived by the vice president. I see.\nLiin Long took a deep breath. He was a\nsimple-minded person commonly known as a\nhotthead. However, fortunately, he still\nhad a basic sense of right and wrong.\nAfter confirming that the conflict was\nnot started by Fong Yu, he took the\ninitiative to lower his head to Fong Yu\nand said, \"I'm sorry. It seems that I\nmisunderstood you.\" Of course, the\nreason Lie Chunlong apologized was not\nonly because he knew the truth, but also\nbecause his life was now in Fong\nYu&lt;unk&gt;s hands. As the saying goes, \"A\nwise man submits to circumstances.\"\nAlthough he was a bit stunned, he was\nnot stupid. Fong Yu looked at Li\nChunlong with a half smile, nodded\nslightly, and said, \"You can admit your\nmistakes, so you're not a bad guy. What\nare you going to do next?\" Lie Chun Long\nglanced at Fong Yu, then asked blankly,\n\"What do you want me to do?\" Fongu\nglanced at the surrounding players out\nof the corner of his eye, pondered for a\nmoment, and then smiled and said,\n\"Actually, I have a good impression of\nyou. You were quite willing to share\ninformation in the chat channel before,\nand now you're willing to challenge me\nsingle-handedly to avenge your brothers.\nYou're quite a loyal and righteous\nperson. Now that the misunderstanding\nhas been cleared up, are you interested\nin joining us? Eliminating an enemy\ndoesn't necessarily mean killing him,\nyou can also try to win him over. Lie is\nquite capable. Although he's a bit\nslow-witted, his character is all right.\nFong Yu isn't the petty type, he's\ntolerant enough. Moreover, this way of\nrepaying evil with good can also improve\nFong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s image and win over a group\nof people. Join us. Fongu nodded and\nsaid, \"The servers will merge in 3 days.\nOur real enemies shouldn't be the\nplayers within the same region. We\nshould unite to deal with the upcoming\nmerge. Your strength is quite good. If\nyou can join us, I can offer you a\nposition as a deputy city lord. Also, I\nwon't participate in the lord election.\nIf you have enough ability and prestige,\nyou can run for Lord if you want. Liin\nLong remained silent for a moment,\nwanting to refuse. But at that moment,\nSong Jimming immediately gave the\nAssociation a look, signaling them to\nquickly persuade him as well. Those\nmembers of the Three Kingdoms were\nalready guilty of crimes. And upon\nseeing this, they immediately seized the\nopportunity to perform. President, why\ndon't you stay here? Yes. Yes. Once we\nleave here, where will we find such a\ngood place to live again? Yes, guild\nleader. Besides, Fong Yu and the other\nplayers in town are all very nice,\ntalented, and have a pleasant way of\nspeaking. I think it's great to stay\nhere. That's right, President. You're so\nstrong now. If you stay here, you can\nprotect us.\" Listening to his members\nwords of advice, Lie Chunlong slowly\nloosened his clenched fist. After\nletting out a long sigh, he looked up at\nFong Yu and said, \"In that case, I'll\nhave to rely on everyone's help in the\nfuture. Chapter 130 naming is a\ndifficult thing.\" The reason Fong Yu\nspared Lie Chinlong&lt;unk&gt;s life and even\ntried to recruit him was not only\nbecause Lee Chunlong was a decent\nperson, but more so because he valued\nLie Chunl&lt;unk&gt;s abilities. With such a\npowerful dragon knight stationed in this\ncity, I don't need to rush to Yorktown\nat the slightest sign of trouble, which\nsaves me a lot of trouble. At the same\ntime, Liechin Long&lt;unk&gt;s appearance also\nmade Fong Yu realize that he was not as\nstrong as he had imagined. If Lie Chun\nLong and his Earth Dragon had not been\nso in sync, giving Fong Yu the\nopportunity to lure them away from their\nmountain stronghold, the outcome would\nhave been hard to predict. Perhaps just\nas Olivia said, the winning percentage\nwas less than 30%. Fortunately, Olivia\noverestimated the synergy between the\nEarth Dragon and the Dragon Knight and\nunderestimated Fong Yu's intelligence.\nThis battle was won unexpectedly, but\nalso reasonably, but this battle served\nas a wake-up call for Fong Yu. He needed\nto improve his strength as soon as\npossible. After dealing with Lee\nChinlong&lt;unk&gt;s matter, Fong Yu and\nOlivia returned to the manor. He planned\nto spend the next 3 days of winter in\nseclusion to cultivate and improve his\nstrength. 3 days later, on the evening\nof the last day of winter, Fong Yu\nreturned to his house after exhausting\nall his magic points in the manor. At\nthis time, his magic points had reached\n300. Under Valentina's magical infusion,\nhe had mastered most of the intermediate\ncombat spells of the six elements.\nAlthough he could not be called an\nexpert, he could basically control them\nskillfully. Besides magic, Fong Yu also\nhoned his close combat skills under\nOlivia's supervision and training and\nsuccessfully raised his strength and\nagility to the level required for the\nBerserker class change, thus completing\nthe Berserker class change. From afar, I\ncan slap your face with magic. Up close,\nI can chop off your head with a knife.\nTruly achieve output without any blind\nspots. Besides improving his own\nabilities, he also acquired a lot of new\nsupplies in these three days. The most\ndirect result was during the last\nrebellion suppression when he and Olivia\nkilled a total of 158 players, gaining\n158 honor points, and 15 chances to draw\nprizes. Although the artifacts on the\nprize wheel were sold out, the 15\nchances still allowed him to obtain two\nepic items, three rare items, and some\nsupplies. The epic items are a grand\nmage's spatial bracelet and the\nnetherworld flower. The arch mage's\nspatial bracelet has an astonishing 50\nstorage slots and is easy to carry. So\nFong Yu directly abandoned the pigkin\nbackpack that hindered his mobility. The\nnetherworld flower has the effect of\nnourishing spirits within a 50 m radius.\nFongu gave it to Valentina as a gift.\nValentina said that with this\nnetherworld flower, she hoped to refine\nher soul to perfection within a year, at\nwhich point she could find a way to\nrestore her physical body. The three top\ntier items are the Elven Empires Dragon\nSlayer Ballista, the mysterious black\ngold ancient blade, and a dragon heart\nthat can increase the strength attribute\nby two points. The Elven Empire's Dragon\nSlayer Ballista is a behemoth. The base\nalone is nearly 3 m high, and the\nmassive crossbow frame is taller than a\nperson. Each of the 10 Dragon Slaying\nbolts that come with it is 2 m long and\nmade of 40 kg of refined iron. Clearly,\nthis thing is no longer a single weapon.\nThe heavy winch alone requires two\nstrong men to pull it. It is entirely a\ndefensive siege weapon. After repeatedly\nconfirming that the dragon to the south\nwould not invade the territory of the\nhaunted house manor, Fong Yu thought\nlong and hard and decided to place it on\nthe gate tower of the Yorktown ruins as\na powerful deterrent weapon. As for the\nmysterious black gold ancient sword,\nFong Yu originally intended to give it\nto Olivia, but Olivia said that she was\nused to her own iron axe and did not\nintend to use the sword. After Fong Yu\nchanged his class to Berserker, he did\nnot have a suitable melee weapon, so he\nmade do with the sword for the time\nbeing. Fong Yu tested the power of this\nblack gold ancient sword. He slashed at\nan iron ingot with one stroke, and the\niron ingot was cut in two. It was no\nexaggeration to say that it could cut\nthrough iron like mud. In order to use\nthis ancient sword, Fong Yu also spent a\nlot of money in the exchange to find a\nsword technique skill book, draw sword\nslash, a blue skill, which cost him a\nfull 80 iron ingots. But after learning\nthe sword drawing technique, Fong Yu\nstill exclaimed that it was worth it\nbecause this sword drawing technique\ncould actually make medium short-range\nattacks within 5 m by relying on the\nsword energy. After being combined with\nthe power of the black gold ancient\nsword, it could cut off a tree trunk\nwith a diameter of 20 cm with one\nstrike. Doesn't that increase the\nefficiency of tree felling? Of course,\nhe wouldn't actually use this skill to\ncut down trees since cutting down too\nmany at once could easily provoke the\nwrath of the forest. Furthermore,\nbecause this skill set was very similar\nto torso skills, Funu had a sudden\ninspiration. While performing the draw\nslash, he also incorporated the wind\nblade into the sword energy, resulting\nin congratulations on successfully\nmastering the magic weapon fusion skill,\nGailblade. Windb blade. With the\nblessing of wind blade, the attack range\nof the draw sword slash is increased\nfrom 5 m to 20 m. The flight speed is\nincreased by 30% and the penetration\npower is increased by 30%. upon hitting\nthe target. In addition to the damage of\nthe draw sword slash itself, it will\nalso deal 50% of the magic damage of\nwind blade. However, the drawback of\nthis sword technique is that it requires\nstamina to activate. Each use consumes\nfive stamina points, which means that\nafter 20 strikes, your stamina will be\ndepleted. However, this happens to\nperfectly match Fong Yu's Berserker\npassive skill because the Berserker's\npassive skill, Furious Battle Spirit,\nincreases strength and agility by 1% for\nevery 1% of stamina lost. In short, the\nless health you have, the more damage\nyou take. So, overall, he can now be\nconsidered a melee mage who is\nproficient in both magic and martial\narts. Besides the rewards from the\nlottery wheel, there's also the daily\nfeeding of the book of evil gods. This\nguy only eats it once a day, and after 3\ndays, he vomited three different things.\nI cannot learn the advanced earth magic\nskill, stone giant summoning, for the\ntime being. A pair of blue rare raid\nwhite feather magic gloves, which can\nincrease casting speed by 20% were\nplaced in Fong use spatial bracelet for\nfuture use. The last thing that came out\nwas quite interesting. It was a broken\nwindup doll that was half a meter tall.\nAs soon as it was spat out, it stood up\non its own, wound itself up, pulled out\na pair of scissors from its pocket, and\nthen with a strange laugh, stabbed at\nFongu. As for the result, this guy was\nnaturally pinned down on the dining\ntable and given a severe beating by\nOlivia. And then Valentina used her\nmental whip skill to ravage him. In the\nend, covered in wounds. He could only\nmeekly and obediently acknowledge Fong\nYu as his master. However, Fong Yu\ndisliked the thing for being too ugly,\nso he sent it to the monster hunt to\nguard the manor. Fong Yu hadn't visited\nthe Yorktown ruins for the past 3 days.\nHowever, according to information from\nSong Jimming, the city walls of Yorktown\nhad been largely restored, and there\nwere 880 houses available for\nhabitation. The number of players who\nhad moved in had reached 2,752\nwhich was nearly half of the total\nnumber of players in the entire region\ncompared to 6,132.\nJust now after a democratic vote by all\nthe players in the city, Song Jiming\nlisted the three most popular names and\nleft the final decision to Fongu.\nPioneering city carving out a new world\nin this desolate place. Peaceful city.\nMay this city and its residents live in\npeace and safety. King's Landing, the\ncity that will serve as our foundation,\nwill conquer the world and reign\nsupreme. Looking at these three names,\nFong Yu fell into deep thought. Which\none should I choose? Chapter 131, the\nman behind the scenes regarding the new\nname for Yorktown. Funu specifically\nasked Olivia and Aalentina for their\nopinions. Surprisingly, the two were in\ncomplete agreement, both choosing King's\nLanding. Even Alpha nodded in approval\nof the name. Because with our\nassistance, Master, you will surely rule\nthe world sooner or later, Valentina\nsaid with a smile. Fongu was silent for\na moment, then asked in return. Why must\none rule the world? Isn't it better to\nlive a peaceful and stable life? I think\nPing and City is quite good. Olivia, who\nwas sharpening her iron axe, raised her\nhead and said calmly, \"This world is\ndangerous. If you want to live a\npeaceful life, you must build a powerful\nempire to fight against those dangers.\nOnly when you rule the world will you\nhave the right to decide what kind of\nlife you want to live.\" Fongi raised his\neyebrows and slowly nodded. Whether it\nwas the seemingly advanced modern\ncivilization of the past or this lost\notherworldly continent, they both adhere\nto the law of survival of the fittest.\nThe weak are only fit to be exploited\nand enslaved while only the strong have\nthe right to set the rules. I\nunderstand. Fongu took a deep breath and\nsmiled slightly. It seems I'll have to\nwork even harder to live the life I\nwant. After hearing Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s words,\nOlivia and Valentina both smiled with\nrelief. During the time Fong Yu had been\ntheir master, they had already figured\nout his character. In fact, he was quite\ngood in every way except that he was a\nbit lazy. This laid-back attitude may be\nrelated to his indifference to fame and\nfortune and his aversion to conflict and\npower struggles. This is not wrong, and\nit is even admirable. However, this\npersonality is not suitable for survival\nin this perilous and desolate world.\nAlthough they really wanted to change\nFong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s personality, they even\nonce instructed Alpha to let him face\ndangers and challenges on his own as\nlong as it did not threaten his life,\nhoping that he could come to his senses\nthrough the trials of life and death.\nAfter all that has happened during this\nperiod, Fong Yu's lazy personality has\nindeed changed a lot. At least he knows\nhe needs to become stronger, and he\nknows how to organize the players to\nbuild the Yorktown ruins. However,\nsubjectively, he still lacks a bit of\nthe belief to actively strive for it.\nToday, through the process of naming the\ntown, Valentina and Olivia finally said\nwhat they had always wanted to say to\nFong Yu, and successfully enlightened\nhim. In that case, Fong Yu glanced at\nhis three companions in the room, took a\ndeep breath, and smiled slightly. Then,\nI'll have to trouble you all to give me\nyour guidance in the future. As you\nwish. Feel free to help. Woof woof woof.\nAs the night passed and a new day\ndawned, a new year dawned, the familiar\nsystem notification sound rang in the\nears of all players. Happy New Year,\ndear players. Congratulations on\ncompleting your first full year in this\nsurvival game. I'm sure you've\nexperienced and learned a lot this year.\nBelow, I'll share some important game\nrules and information, so please\nremember them carefully. First, the 10\nregions in this game are about to be\nmerged. The barriers between the regions\nhave disappeared and you can now travel\nfreely between them. So, will you choose\npeaceful development or forceful\nannexation? I'll be watching. The top\nthree regions in the first year's points\nrankings are now being announced and\nsystem rewards are being awarded. Third\nplace, zone 5, 3,112\nsurvivors. Survival value 3.112 million.\nResource acquisition value 26505\nmillion. Total value 29.617\nplus one to any attribute point. Second\nplace zone 3,677\nsurvivors. Survival value 3.677\n30.108\nmillion. Total value 33.785\nplace server 6 6,055\nsurvivors. Survival value 6.055\n40.09 million. Total value 46.064\nin regions five, three, and six.\nEspecially for regions three and six,\nyou've secured the top two spots twice\nin a row. Keep it up. In addition to the\nattribute point rewards for the top\nthree scorers, this ranking also\nincludes extra rewards and penalties. A\ndivine beast will randomly enter the top\nfive areas, waiting for a lucky player\nto capture it. Meanwhile, a calamity\nlevel ferocious beast will randomly\nenter the bottom five areas, causing\nunpredictable destruction. Let's pray\nthat the bottom five areas don't get\nwiped out. Next, we come to the part\neveryone's been waiting for, the Lord\nelection. I'm sure you've all been\neagerly anticipating this. For the sake\nof information security in each region,\nI've posted the list of eligible\ncandidates for Lord in each region's\nchat channel. Do you remember the\nelection rules? Good luck to the player\nwith the highest resource acquisition\nand the player with the most popular\nvotes in your region. The following are\nsome changes to the game rules. One,\nwhen the world chat channel is open, the\nlanguage will automatically switch to a\nlanguage that the player can recognize.\nTwo, the exchange has enabled cross\nregional trading. Three, honor points\ngained from killing players from other\nregions are doubled. Four, players can\nchoose to stay in this region or\ntransfer to another region. Transferring\nto another region does not require the\nconsent of the lord of the current\nregion, but it does require the consent\nof the lord of the target region. Five,\nwhen a lord dies, he will automatically\nbe replaced by the player with the\nhighest amount of resources in the\nentire region. Six, a lord may choose to\nmerge their entire region into another\nregion. After merging, the lord's status\nwill be automatically revoked. Seven,\nenable the map function. Players in this\narea can complete the area map by\nsharing the map information they have\nexplored. Almost forgot. Players in the\nbottom five regions will be branded as\nslaves for a year and 20% of their\nacquired resources will be given to\nplayers in the top five regions. Here's\na suggestion. If you don't want to be\nslaves, you can choose to transfer to\nanother region. That concludes this\nsystem announcement. What remains is the\nelection of the two Lord candidates in\nthe sixth district chat channel. Fong Yu\nopened the regional chat channel and\nthere was only one pin system message.\nPlayer with the highest resource\nacquisition in this region. Fong Yu\nTotal resource value acquired throughout\nthe year 6,653,300.\nWu Jingia ID 757. Holy crap. 6.65\nmillion. Leong Yuchi ID 331. My god.\nFong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s resource acquisition alone\nexceeds 15% of the entire server. Dong\nHao ID 3356\nas expected of boss Fong Yu. Yds Ton Xi\nKong ID7171.\nYou're a true master. Please accept my\nbow. The chat channel immediately\nstarted flooded with messages. All the\nplayers were incredulous. How could one\nperson obtain so many resources? It was\nsimply outrageous. What they didn't know\nwas that aside from the dozens of ghosts\nand zombies mining for Fong Yu in the\nghost mine, the artifacts and other\nhighle equipment that Fong Yu obtained\nthrough the lottery roulette and the\nbook of evil god were worth over 5\nmillion. The public vote for lord will\nend in 30 minutes. Please vote for your\npreferred lord as soon as possible.\nFailure to vote within 30 minutes will\nbe considered as a waiver of your vote.\nUpon seeing this, Fong Yu immediately\nspoke in the newly created King's\nLanding chat channel. Everyone, let's\nproceed as we agreed before. I've chosen\nSong Jimming as our lord. Who agrees?\nWho disagrees? 30 minutes later, the\nregional chat channel has released a new\nannouncement. Player with the highest\nresource acquisition in this region,\nwith a total resource value of 6.65 65\nmillion throughout the year. Player with\nthe most votes in this region. Song\nJimming ID 3533 with 3,125\nvotes received in half an hour. Player\nFong Yu ID006\nwill compete against player song Xing ID\n3533 in a Lord election arena. Both\nplayers are requested to prepare in\nadvance. The contestant may choose to\nwithdraw within half an hour. Upon\nseeing this, Fong Yu smiled slightly and\nsent a message to Song Jimming. Hey Lao\nSong, how about we play a game? A moment\nlater, Song Jimming sent a message.\nBoss, you're kidding me. This isn't a\ngame. You want to play another round?\nPeople will die. I'm waiting for you to\nforfeit. If you change your mind and\nwant to be the Lord, I'll forfeit\nimmediately. Several crying emojis\nfollowed the message. It was obvious\nthat he knew he would be the one to die\nif he really went into a duel with Fong\nYu. Fong Yu raised an eyebrow slightly\nand replied, \"He, don't panic. It was\njust a joke.\" \"Sonjing, this is no joke.\nYou scared me to death.\" Fong Yu smiled\nagain. He was just testing Song Jimming\na little. Judging from his reaction just\nnow, he was still able to understand his\nown position. So, Fong Yu directly chose\nto forfeit the match in the Lord's arena\nentry options. Player Fong Yu ID 0006 in\nthis region has withdrawn from the Lord\nElection Arena. The Lord of Region 6 has\nbeen selected as Song Jiming ID 3533.\nCongratulations to player Song Juming ID\n3533.\nSeeing this, Fong Yu finally breathed a\nsigh of relief. Everything was\nproceeding according to his plan and the\nmatter was settled. Anyway, Song Jiming\nis now a member of the undead in his own\nmanner. Although he is nominally the\nlord, the real controller is Fong Yu. In\nthis way, he has become the\nbehind-the-scenes person in District 6\nand can also free up more time to do\nwhat he wants to do. Fongu was very\nsatisfied with the result. So, he got\nout of bed, humming a little tune as he\nwent to the living room. After greeting\nhis three friends, he began to enjoy the\nexquisite breakfast that Valentina had\nprepared for him. Chapter 132. Searching\nfor the auspicious beast. While eating\nbreakfast, Fong Yu carefully studied\nsome details in today's system\nannouncement, and some of them were\nquite thought-provoking. For example,\narticle 4 states that players can choose\nto stay in the current region or\nof the lord of the target region. If\nthis is combined with the rule that\nplayers in the fifth ranked region must\ncontribute 20% of the next year's\nrevenue to players in the top five\nregions, it would undoubtedly force\nplayers in the bottom five regions to\ntransfer to the top five regions, thus\navoiding the 20% tax. If a large number\nof players from the bottom five regions\nmigrate to other regions, those regions\nwill quickly lose competitiveness due to\na sharp decrease in the number of\nplayers and will eventually be swallowed\nup by the top five regions. It is\nforeseeable that in the next 2 days, a\nlarge number of players from the bottom\nfive regions will transfer to other\nregions. After all, the system has added\na penalty measure for the bottom five\nregions. A calamity level monster will\nbe sent into the bottom five regions to\ncause destruction. If players from the\nbottom five regions choose to stay in\ntheir own regions, they will have to\nlose 20% of their income and face a\ncalamity level monster, which is almost\nno different from waiting to die. From\nthis, Funu deduced that the game system\nactually wanted to reduce the number of\nregions, ultimately guiding players to\nunify the 10 regions. The area that\nplayers most want to enter is naturally\nthe sixth district where Fong Yu is\nlocated. After all, people strive for\nhigher positions and water flows\ndownhill. Why join the second or third\ndistrict when you can join the top\nranked district? So, the question is,\nshould we accept the transfers of the\nlast five players from different\nregions? From the perspective of the\noverall interests of the region, the\nmore players the better since the number\nof players determines the overall\nstrength of the region and the total\namount of resources acquired and players\nthemselves are a strategic resource.\nHowever, Fongu noticed that the other\nnine regions were all occupied by\nplayers from countries other than China.\nThis raises issues related to historical\nlegacies, cultural differences, and even\ndifferences in race and religion. For\nexample, in Japan, due to some\nhistorical issues, enemies are extremely\nhostile towards each other. For men to\ntransfer to this region is practically\nsuicide. But for women, it's not\nentirely impossible. And then there's\nIndia, a fascinating country with vastly\ndifferent cultures. Just as Fongu was\npondering, Song Jimming sent him a\nmessage. Sanjiing ID 3533 boss, I just\nreceived a lot of transfer requests from\nplayers in the bottom five regions.\nShould I approve them? Fongu thought for\na moment and replied, \"Can you see the\ninformation of those players who\napplied?\" Songing ID 3533. You can see\nthe name, gender, and attribute panel,\nbut you can't see anything else. Fong Yu\nID 006. Then let's select the best\ncandidates. Those with too low stats\nshould be eliminated. By the way, should\nwe be able to tell which players\nprevious nationalities are from their\nnames? Songing ID 3533. The names are\nsimilar. And even if you can't tell, you\ncan just ask. Fong UD006.\nWell, let's not consider men from Japan\nand India for now. You can decide what\nto do with the others yourself. Songing\nID 3533. He boss, you and I are thinking\nthe same thing. Got it. I'll take care\nof the rest. Fong UID006.\nYeah, keep it up. I believe in you.\nAfter dealing with this minor issue and\nfinishing breakfast, he started figuring\nout where to best allocate the three\nattribute points from the reward. His\ncurrent attributes are intelligence\n10.66,\nstrength 9.85,\nagility 6.33.\nIntelligence is currently sufficient and\nstrength increased by three points after\nconsuming the borelord's heart and the\nwyvern's heart, just a little short of\nreaching 10. Agility is his biggest\nweakness right now. Although he has been\ntraining in physical fitness and agility\nwith Olivia for the past 3 days, the\ntime has been too short and the\nimprovement has been limited. He\nremembered that he had previously\nmastered the prerequisite skill for the\nmarksman, divine arrow. But to switch to\nthe marksman class, his agility needed\nto be greater than eight. Therefore,\nFongu decided to add all three attribute\npoints from the bonus to agility so that\nhe could have another job advancement.\nHe already understood his role. Olivia\nwas a semi-tanky damage dealer. Alpha\nwas a roaming assassin. Valentina was a\nmid-lane mage. And he was a squishy\nranged damage dealer. It is indeed very\ncrunchy, but the damage it causes is\nalso quite high. He had previously used\nexplosive arrows when eliminating the\npigheaded man at the Yorktown ruins.\nThese things are indeed extremely\npowerful and deal area damage. Funu has\nalready asked the system. If he changes\nhis job to become a sharpshooter, his\nshooting range will increase from over\n30 m to 100 m, basically allowing him to\nshoot wherever he points. This is just a\nbeginner archer. With each upgrade, the\nrange will increase by about 50 m. If\none can reach the legendary saint level\narcher, the range can reach a terrifying\n1,000 m. Combined with explosive arrows,\nit becomes a veritable mobile artillery\nturret. Therefore, the profession of\nsharpshooter is very useful to him. You\nhave met the requirements for the\nmarksman class change. You have learned\ndivine arrow technique and your agility\nof 9.33 is sufficient. Would you like to\nchange classes? Change. You have\nsuccessfully advanced to the marksman\nclass and learn new skills. Multi-shot\nand evasion attack. Multi-shot fires two\nto three arrows at once to strike the\ntarget, consuming one point of sanity\neach time. Evasive strike, highly agile\nmarksman can quickly dodge and\ncounterattack when enemies get close.\nCool down 5 seconds. Two very good and\npractical skills. Fongu smiled slightly.\nHe now holds five professions. Butcher,\nmage, alchemist, berserker, and\nsharpshooter. Three of which are related\nto combat. Alpha Olivia, let's go. Let's\ngo out. Fongu called out, gathered the\nusable equipment, put on the blue armor\nassault set, and prepared to go out to\nfind the auspicious beast. He even\nposted a bounty in the regional chat\nchannel, offering 5,000 wood to anyone\nwho could provide the exact location of\nthe auspicious beast. Since his fight\nwith Dragon Knight Lee Chunlong, Fongu\nhas realized the importance of pets,\nespecially combat pets, which are of\ngreat help in battle. Although I already\nhave a little spider named Sakura, that\nguy doesn't seem to be the fighting\ntype. After raising him for so many\ndays, he's only grown to the size of a\nwatermelon. Moreover, he's extremely\ntimid and hides in the monster house at\nthe slightest sound. As for Alpha and\nOlivia, although they can help Fong Yu a\nlot in battle, Alpha is an agile\nassassin and Olivia is a frontal\nwarrior, he still lacks a tanky support\npet like the Earth Dragon. I don't know\nwhat kind of apicious beast will appear\nthis time. But no matter what kind it\nis, let's get our hands on it first. So\nFong Yu and his two companions began\nsearching the area, keeping a close eye\non the messages in the regional chat\nchannel. However, 2 hours later, Fongu\nhad searched almost the entire\nsurrounding forest, but still couldn't\nfind any trace of the auspicious beast.\nNo one in the chat channel provided any\ninformation about it either. He didn't\nknow if no one had found it or if\nsomeone had found it, but was reluctant\nto tell others. Therefore, in a fit of\nanger, Fong Yu directly raised the\nbounty to 10,000 units of timber.\nPerhaps because the reward was high\nenough. Fong Yu soon received five\nmessages from players in the same\nregion, all saying that they had\ndiscovered a suspicious monster and\nsuspected it was a mythical beast. Fongu\nopened the map based on the location\ninformation they provided and compared\nit. He found that two players had marked\nvery similar locations. Both said that\nthey had never seen a flying monster\nbefore and that the flying monster would\nemit colorful light. Based on this, Fong\nYu analyzed that the most likely place\nwas where the auspicious beast would\nappear. So, he led his two companions\nand rushed toward the location on the\nmap. Chapter 133. Speak louder. I can't\nhear you. Because the game system had\nrecently enabled the map function, Fong\nYu easily found the location provided by\nthe intelligence. It was in a valley 5\nkm away from Fong Yu's manor. As seen on\nthe map, this valley is surrounded by\nmountains on three sides, with its only\nentrance being a narrow rock crevice\nthat can almost be described as a sliver\nof sky. When Fong Yu arrived at the\ncrevice, he sensed something was a miss.\nBecause the location marked by the two\nplayers who provided the information was\nthe depression in the center of this\nvalley. Why would a flying mythical\nbeast linger in such a place? Flying\ncreatures, whether monsters or\nauspicious beasts, seemed to be best\nsuited to stay on mountain tops or in\nforests. The valley, which was almost\nsurrounded by mountains, was more like a\ntrap. A trap waiting for Fongu to walk\nright into it. At this moment, Olivia\nleaned close to Fong Yu and said, \"There\nare people spying on us on the mountain\nside on the left and right. These eyes\nare all hostile.\" Fongu frowned upon\nhearing this. He knew he had guessed\ncorrectly. This was indeed a trap. A\ntrap to lure the victim in. The question\nnow is whether to turn around and leave\nimmediately or to turn the tables and\nwipe out all those guys who dared to set\nhim up. Fongu chose the latter because\nescaping is only a temporary solution.\nIf he doesn't get rid of those who dared\nto harm him, they will come looking for\ntrouble again sooner or later. Rather\nthan that, it's better to nip the danger\nin the butt. Since we don't know how\nmany people are hiding in this valley or\nwhat their strength is, it would be\nunwise to rush in and fight them\ndirectly. The best approach is to force\nthese people to reveal themselves and\nthen make further plans after\ndetermining the number and location of\nthe enemy. As for how to force these\nambushers to show themselves, Fongu\nglanced at the forest covering the\nmountain, smiled slightly, and summoned\ntwo fireballs. After the two fireballs\nwere thrown into the forest, the two\ngiant trees were ignited and began to\nburn fiercely. Then Fong Yu summoned two\nmore fireballs and continued to throw\nthem into the forest. Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s\nactions completely baffled the ambushers\nhiding in the woods. What's this guy up\nto? One of the ambushers asked his\ncompanion, \"What else could they be\ndoing? They've probably discovered us\nand want to set the mountain on fire. Is\nhe an idiot? How can the speed at which\nthe fire burns out keep up with our\nrunning speed? Just as the ambush\nattacker finished speaking, a sudden\ngust of wind swept in and the flames on\nthe burning giant trees spread instantly\nto the surrounding giant trees. Since it\nwas the first day of spring, the trees\nwere still in a state of bare branches.\nIn addition, because fire is not easy to\nextinguish, a large number of trees on\nthe mountaintop started to burn\ninstantly. Damn, this guy's luck is too\ngood. A strong wind is blowing for him\nright now. One of the ambushers cursed.\nAnother ambusher retorted, \"Are you\nblind? Didn't you see that it was Fong\nYu who chanted the spell and used magic\nto summon the wind?\" The ambush was\nactually a low-level water mage and the\nonly mage, which is why he noticed the\ndetails of Fong use spell-casting. A\nmagician? That guy is actually a\nmagician. H, how are we supposed to\nfight him? Some of the more timid\nambushers were already starting to get\nscared. What's there to be afraid of?\nI'm a mage, too. And that guy is at most\na dual elemental mage of fire and wind,\nwhile I'm a water mage, which is a\nnatural counter to him. Besides, we have\ndozens of brothers with us. Let's charge\nat him together. Even if he had three\nheads and six arms, he couldn't stop us.\nWhat if that guy throws fireballs at us?\nOne of the ambushers asked. That's easy.\nI'll use water ball to counter his\nfireballs. Besides, he's already\nreleased so many fireballs, his mana is\nprobably almost depleted, so we don't\nneed to worry. Listening to the water\nmage's eloquent explanation, the\nambushers were no longer so afraid. As\nthese people were discussing, the fire\non the mountaintop gradually spread\ndown, forcing the ambushers hiding on\nthe mountain side to run down to the\nbottom. At the same time, the entire\nforest began to shake strangely. Holy\ncrap. What's going on? Why do I feel\nlike the tree next to me is moving? I\nfeel the same way. This isn't a normal\nfeeling. They're actually moving. Holy\ncrap. What's that? Watch out. A gigantic\nhand made of tree branches slammed down,\nshoving several ambushers into the mud.\nScreams of agony filled the air. Before\nlong, the giant trees in the mountains\nthat hadn't yet caught fire transformed\ninto tree people, beginning to\nextinguish the spreading wildfire and\nalso attacking the ambushers who weren't\npart of the forest. After witnessing\nseveral ambushers being smashed into\nmince meat by the trench giant hand,\nthose guys had no choice but to flee out\nof the forest as fast as they could. As\nfor those who were slower, they\nbasically became nourishment for the\nforest. Soon, Fong Yu, who was at ease,\nsaw more than 30 disheveled figures\nrunning out of the woods. After\nstruggling through the woods with all\ntheir might, most of them collapsed on\nthe ground, panting. However, a few\npeople who were obviously in good\nphysical condition quickly recovered and\ntook out their weapons, looking at Fongu\nnot far away. After glancing at these\npeople, Fongu basically judged that\ntheir strength was quite ordinary. Many\nof them were still carrying low-level\ntools such as wooden sticks and stone\npicks. Coupled with their scattered\nformation, they were just a bunch of\nrabble. He and his two companions should\nbe able to deal with them easily. Fongu\nsmiled at the group and asked, \"Oh, what\na coincidence. You're here to capture\nauspicious beasts, too.\" The group\nlooked at each other, but no one\nanswered Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s question. It\nwasn't until a bald man with a dragon\ntattoo across his shoulder, shirtless\nand panting, stood up from the ground\nthat he shouted at Fong Yu. \"You're Fong\nYu. What brings you here?\" Fongu asked.\nAfter adjusting the thick gold chain\naround his neck, the bald man said\nmenacingly to Fong Yu. I heard you're\nthe player with the most resources in\nall of District 6. So, what if I am?\nFongu raised an eyebrow. Brother, I'm a\nlittle short on cash lately. If you know\nwhat's good for you, hand over some\nsupplies and we'll let you go. Fong Yu\nwas immediately delighted upon hearing\nthis. What kind of time is this? How can\nanyone still dare to rip me off? Fong Yu\nthen pointed to himself and asked, \"Are\nyou sure you know me? Why should I know\nyou? All I know is that you're the\nrichest guy in District 6. Hurry up and\nshut up. Either hand over your supplies\nor you can wait to be hacked to death by\nmy brothers and chopped into mince meat\nto feed the dogs.\" After a moment of\nsilence, Funu asked, \"You're not from\nDistrict 6.\" Upon hearing this, the bald\nman raised his chin and said, \"It wasn't\nbefore, but it is now. I came from\nSoutheast Asia in District 7. Ever heard\nof the Hungley Group in southern\nMyammar? I'm the general manager of the\nHungley Group. These guys behind me are\nmy underlings.\" \"I see.\" Fongu suddenly\nrealized that makes sense. His combat\nprowess was renowned throughout the\nentire region. Not to mention, the fight\nhe had with the Dragon Knight in King's\nLanding had been widely circulated in\nthe regional chat by his support group.\nHow could any player from the same\nregion possibly dare to cause him\ntrouble? It turned out they were players\nfrom another region who had just\nentered. They looked like overseas\nChinese or people of Chinese descent.\nSo, Song Jimming approved their transfer\napplications immediately. But he didn't\nexpect these guys to have such ideas\nabout him as soon as they entered the\nregion. They're really courting death.\nBut what about southern Myanmar? Hi\ngroup. Fongu raised an eyebrow and\nasked, \"Are you one of those scam groups\nthat make fraudulent phone calls?\" \"Um,\nit seems you do more than just scams. I\nheard you're also involved in human\ntrafficking and organ trading.\" Upon\nhearing this, the bald man sneered. \"Oh,\nkid, you know quite a bit. Since you\nknow so much, I advise you to be\nsensible and hand over all the supplies\nor you'll be in for a world of trouble.\nFunu shrugged slightly and sneered\nindifferently. Huh? We don't know he'll\nsuffer yet. What did you say? The bald\nman seemed to think he had misheard.\nFong Yu pointed at the bald man and the\nplayers behind him and said with a\ncontemptuous expression, \"I said you can\nall come at me together. Come and chop\nme up, my brothers.\" After finally\nconfirming he hadn't misheard, the bald\nman cursed in an unintelligible dialect,\nthen waved his hand and said to his\nhenchmen behind him, \"Get him. Don't\nkill him. Break his legs first.\" So the\nplayers raised their swords, spears, and\nclubs and charged at Fong Yu. The water\nmage also stood next to the bald man and\nbegan chanting a waterball spell,\npreparing to deal with Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s\nfireball spell. Seeing the vicious\nplayers charging towards him, Fong Yu\nwaved his magic wand and unleashed more\nthan a dozen windb blades in quick\nsuccession. Because of the rapid\ncasting, Fongu didn't use his mental\npower to control the wind blades for\nprecise strikes. He simply unleashed a\nbarrage of attacks to provide firepower\ncoverage. As sharp whistling sounds\nswept past, more than a dozen of the\ndozens of players rushing towards Fongu\nwere quickly struck by the wind blades.\nDressed only in linen clothes, they were\nno match for the sharp wind blades. Some\npeople who were hit in non-vital areas\nsuch as their hands, feet, and abdomen\nfared better, only falling to the ground\nand howling in pain. If you're unlucky\nenough to catch it with your head, \"The\nsight is too beautiful to bear.\" \"Holy\ncrap, what just flew right over my\nhead?\" one player asked the person next\nto him. However, when he turned around,\nhe saw that the other player was already\nlying on the ground, clutching his\nbleeding neck. Some players with better\neyesight recognized the wind blade and\nimmediately warned, \"Watch out! It's a\nwind magic blade. Those with armor\nquickly cover your vital areas.\"\nHowever, most people only had swords and\nclubs and no armor, so the charging\nplayers quickly began to look for cover.\nAt this moment, the bald man, who was\nthe leader, also realized Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s\nstrength, so he shouted urgently to the\nwater mage beside him, \"What the hell\nare you doing? Fight back!\" At this\nmoment, the water mage was also\nspeechless with frustration. He couldn't\nunderstand how Fong You could cast\nspells instantly, and even more so, a\nseries of wind blades. He had finally\nmanaged to condense a water sphere, and\nthen used his mental power to guide it\nto smash it towards Fong Yu. However,\nthe next second, a water ball condensed\nfrom the tip of Fong Us's magic wand and\nsmashed towards the water ball in\nmidair. Smack. The collision of the\nwater spheres produced a crisp sound of\nwater waves crashing together. After the\ntwo different mental energies collided,\nFong Yu's mental energy easily\noverwhelmed the mental energy of the\nwater mage opposite him. As a result,\nthe opponent's water sphere shattered\ninto splashes of water in the blink of\nan eye. while Fong Yu's water sphere\ncontinued to fly towards the water mage.\n\"Holy crap!\" The water mage jumped in\nsurprise and quickly hid behind the bald\nman, shouting, \"Boss, quickly raise your\nshield. What the hell is going on?\" the\nbald man yelled quickly, pulling out a\nwooden round shield to shield himself\nand shouted, \"Why can't your water\nsphere beat that guy's water sphere?\"\nThe water mage hiding behind replied\nwith a long face, \"I don't know either.\nMaybe his level is higher than mine.\"\nJust then, the water ball launched by\nFong Yu bypassed the bald man's wooden\nshield, circled around, and smashed into\nthe water mage's face. Smack. Amidst the\nsplashing water, the water mage\nimmediately fainted, his eyes rolling\nback in his head. The bald man was\nstartled when he saw the magician behind\nhim fall. They had clearly used their\nshields to block the attack. So, why\ncould the water sphere still hit them?\nCould that water balloon turn? Just as\nthe bald man was surprised, another wind\nblade bypassed the shield he was holding\nand struck his forehead. Bite. A crisp\nclanging sound rang out, and a scratch\nappeared on the iron headband worn by\nthe bald man, almost completely severing\nit. Baldi also fell to the ground under\nthe impact of the wind blades. He\ntouched his head in horror and only\nbreathed a sigh of relief after finding\nthat he was not injured, but his eyes\nturned to fong you with fear. What kind\nof monster is that? At this moment,\nFongu was still constantly unleashing\nwind blades. Because there were quite a\nfew that needed to be controlled, the\naccuracy was slightly worse, and he\ncouldn't kill with a single blow.\nHowever, those who were hit in vital\nareas such as the head, chest, and neck\nby the wind blades were basically dead.\nAfter his magic power was depleted,\nFongu stuck his wand into the ground and\nlet out a long sigh of relief. The bald\nman, who had been watching the battle\nclosely, saw Fong Yu put down his wand\nand exclaimed with delight, \"Quick! That\nguy's out of magic! Now's the time.\nCharge over and kill him.\" However, the\nbald man's words seemed to have no\neffect. The surviving henchmen either\nlay on the ground or hid behind piles of\nrocks, none of them daring to move.\nSeeing this, the bald man gritted his\nteeth and said, \"Whoever kills him, I'll\nreward him with supplies worth 10,000.\"\nAs the saying goes, \"A generous reward\nalways brings forth brave men.\" The bald\nman's words seemed to have an effect.\nTwo of his underlings gritted their\nteeth and rushed out from behind cover,\ncharging towards Fong Yu once again.\nWith their leader in charge, the rest of\nthe underlings followed suit and charged\ntowards Fong Yu once more. Seeing this,\nFong Yu waved to stop Olivia from\nstepping forward and said with a smile,\n\"It's all right. Leave it to me.\" After\nsaying that, Fongu took out the horned\nyab bow and pulled out three feathered\narrows, knocking them onto the bowring.\nMultiple arrows, one shot, two shots,\nthree shots. Guided by spiritual power,\nthese arrows transformed into death\nwarrants, ruthlessly reaping the enemies\nwho were still terrified by the wind\nblade attacks. For both mages and\narchers, a distance of around 30 meters\nis the optimal close quarters combat\ndistance where the accuracy of magic and\narrows can be maintained at its highest\nlevel. As for those lackey who don't\neven have proper armor, they are\nbasically unable to withstand a single\nwindb blade or arrow from Fongu. If so,\nthen fire another arrow. This can be\ndescribed as a dimensional reduction\nattack, a one-sided massacre with no\nsuspense whatsoever. After firing\nseveral more multi-shot arrows, Fun Yu\ncalmly put away his horned bow, glanced\nat the players who were all lying on the\nground, took out his black gold ancient\nsword, touched the sharp blade, looked\nat the players who were terrified, and\nsighed helplessly. \"Sigh! With such\nmediocre skills, why did you come all\nthis way to act like a big shot? You're\njust wasting my time.\" Immediately, Fong\nYu, carrying the black gold ancient\nsword, slowly walked up to the only bald\nman still standing and asked calmly,\n\"What did you just say? You wanted to\nkill me.\" The bald man's legs went weak,\nand he knelt on the ground, raising his\nhands above his head in prayer,\ntrembling as he begged for mercy. \"I'm\nso sorry. What did you say?\" Fongu\npicked at his ear, raised an eyebrow,\nand said, \"Speak louder. I can't hear\nyou.\" Chapter 134. Luring the tiger away\nfrom the mountain. Looking at his\nbrothers who had perished in the\nnorthwest, the bald man slumped to the\nground, his trousers soaked with water.\nHe couldn't understand how one person\ncould wipe out a team of more than 30\nmen in just one minute. But that's\nprecisely the charm of a magician. Given\nenough casting time and range, a\nmagician becomes a small army. With the\n30% casting speed bonus from the all\nelemental combat staff and the 20%\ncasting speed bonus from the white\nfeather magic gloves, the wind blade,\nwhich only requires a 1 second cast\ntime, can be completed in just 0.5\nseconds. Add to that the multi-shot,\nwhich takes only 2 seconds from drawing\nthe bow to firing, and Fongu handles\nthese minions without Alpha and Olivia\nlifting a finger. Looking at the bald\nman in front of him who had already wet\nhimself in fear, Fongu felt bored. He\nlit a fireball in his hand, not wanting\nto waste any more words and prepared to\nburn the culprit to death. Upon seeing\nthis, the bald man immediately cow out\nto Fongu, crying and wailing, \"Brother,\nI was wrong. I was just being\ninstructed. Please let me go. I will\nnever dare to do it again. I'm sorry.\nYou don't have a future.\" Fongu had no\nintention of tolerating outsiders who\nlike to make money through crooked\nmeans. They started thinking about\nrobbing and looting as soon as they\nentered district 6 and keeping them\naround would only cause trouble in the\nfuture. Just as Fongu was about to throw\nthe fireball at the bald man, the bald\nman suddenly said, \"We were tricked into\ncoming here too.\" Hearing this, Funu put\naway the fireball and frowned, asking,\n\"Were you tricked into coming here?\"\nexplained clearly. Upon seeing that\nFongu had extinguished the fireball, the\nbald man quickly cowtowed to Fong Yu\nseveral times and explained, \"We were\nplanning to head straight to King's\nLanding where the Lord is after we\ntransferred to zone 6. Just as we were\nasking for directions in the zone chat\nchannel, a player named Leong Painting\nsuddenly said that Fong Yu, the richest\nplayer in the entire zone, was looking\nfor a mythical beast and asked us to\nfind an opportunity to ambush you. So,\nyou came.\" Fongu raised an eyebrow and\nsaid, \"You guys are really stupid. Don't\nyou know how to use your brains? How\ncould someone who's the richest player\nin the entire region be weak? We thought\nyou might be very strong, but we didn't\nexpect you to become this strong,\" the\nbald man said timidly. \"Mainly because\nLeong Pinking told us that you're not\nactually that strong and you don't even\ndare to fight in the Lord's arena. So, I\nthought with 40 or 50 people, we could\ndefinitely do it, too. You can take me\ndown too, right?\" The bald man nodded.\nFongu narrowed his eyes and sneered. Do\nyou know where Leong Pinking is right\nnow? The bald man shook his head and\nsaid, \"I don't know. She didn't come\nwith you to ambush me. She didn't tell\nme that.\" Funu frowned. First of all, he\ncould confirm that Leong Ping was a\nplayer from this region. He seemed to\nhave seen her posts in the region chat\nchannel before. Since she was a player\nfrom this region, she should know that\nhe would not be so easily ambushed and\nkilled. Moreover, he didn't seem to have\nany grudge against this woman named\nLeong Ping. So, why would she send\nsomeone to ambush him? If she really had\na grudge against him, why didn't she\nparticipate in this ambush? Therefore,\nit's highly likely that she didn't have\na grudge against him. She just wanted\nthese people to stall him. As for her\npurpose in stalling him, a diversionary\ntactic. This was the first thing Fong Yu\nthought of. Could it be that Leong Ping\nis a player from a hostile faction in\nthis region trying to distract me before\nlaunching a surprise attack on King's\nLanding? Thinking of this, Fong Yu\ndirectly opened the chat list and asked\nSong Jimming if King's Landing had been\nattacked or if there were any suspicious\npeople near the town. A moment later,\nSong Jimming returned and found no one\nattacking the town, nor any suspicious\npersons nearby. That's strange, Fong Yu\nfrowned. What exactly is that guy trying\nto do? At this moment, the bald man\nkneeling on the ground cautiously said,\n\"Do you think it's possible that she\nwanted to get you out of the way so she\ncould steal something from your house?\"\nFu hadn't really thought about this\nquestion. It wasn't that he couldn't\nthink of it, but rather that he felt his\nmanner. It seems difficult for a living\nperson to go in and come out alive. But\nas Sherlock Holmes once said, \"When all\npossibilities have been ruled out, the\nleast likely one is probably the truth.\"\nFongu glanced at the bald man in front\nof him, a meaningful look flashing in\nhis eyes and said calmly, \"I'm a man of\nmy word. You can leave now.\" Upon\nhearing this, the bald man was overjoyed\nand cowtowed several times to Fong you\nwith deep gratitude. Although I'm\nletting you off the hook this time, let\nme make this clear. If I find out you've\ndone anything wrong again, I'll make you\nwish you were dead. Yes, yes, I\ndefinitely won't dare to do it again.\nGet out. So, the bald man scrambled and\ncrawled away into the distance. At this\nmoment, Olivia leaned closer and asked,\n\"Master, why don't you kill him?\" Fongu\nsaid calmly, \"His life is worthless, but\nmy integrity is. Since I promised to\nrelease him, I will. Besides, with his\nword, others will know that I, Fong Yu,\nam not someone to be trifled with, so\ndon't come looking for trouble.\nImmediately, Fong Yu contacted\nSanjuming. Fong Yu ID00006,\ndidn't you recently approve a batch of\nplayers from server 7 to transfer to\nanother server? Songing ID 3533. Huh?\nHow did you know? Yes. Yes. That's\nright. Song jamming ID 3533. Holy crap.\nWait a minute. I was busy just now and\nonly just saw the system notification.\nHow come all those players are dead? Did\nyou kill brother Fong? Fong UID006.\nH. This group of people were misled by a\nplayer in this area and actually tried\nto ambush me, but I killed them instead.\nHowever, I left one alive. You keep a\nclose eye on him. If he dares to do\nanything else, kill him directly.\nSanjuming ID 3533 received. Fong\nUID00006.\nBy the way, ask him about the specifics\nof zone 7. He said it's the Southeast\nAsian zone. Find out the details and let\nme know. Also, try to find out about\nzone 5 since those two zones are right\nnext to us. Song jamming ID 3533. No\nproblem. Leave it to me. After\nexplaining everything, Fongu thought for\na moment and decided to go back to the\nmanor to see if anyone was trying to\nsteal chickens while he was away. When\nhe returned to the manor with his two\ncompanions, he indeed saw two slender\npurplish black tentacles standing in the\nopen space outside the manor, and those\ntwo tentacles were wrapped around a\nwoman who was struggling. The scene was\nsomewhat inappropriate for children.\nChapter 135. Responding to all changes\nwith unchanging principles. Are you\nLeong painting? Fong Yu asked, looking\nat the woman entangled by tentacles.\nUpon seeing Fong Yu, the woman struggled\neven more fiercely, but too thick. Long\ntentacles locked her limbs tightly,\nrendering her struggles feudal. Don't\nbother struggling. The way you're\nstruggling is only pleasing to the eye\nfor me, and it serves no other purpose.\nFong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s words seemed to have some\neffect. The woman gave up struggling,\nglared at Fong Yu fiercely, and shouted,\n\"Bastard! Put me down! You've got quite\na temper, but you seem to have\nmisunderstood. It's those tentacles\nthat's binding you, not me. Talking to\nme won't change anything. Fong Yu teased\nwith a half smile. But you seem to be\nenjoying it just now. Why did you become\nembarrassed as soon as I arrived? At\nthis moment, Fong Yu also saw a dozen or\nso slightly smaller tentacles scattered\non the ground and two exquisitly\ncrafted, slender daggers lying on the\nground. Wow, that's pretty impressive.\nYou actually took down more than a dozen\ntentacles. That's some fighting power.\nFong Yu teased with a smile. Put me down\nif you dare. Then what? I'm going to\nkill you. Fong you raised an eyebrow and\nsmiled faintly. H So you're not here to\nsteal anything? You're here to take\nrevenge on me. I originally came here to\nburn down your house. But I never\nexpected you to have such disgusting\nthings here. Burn down my house. Girl,\nwhat deep-seated grudge do we have that\nwarrants burning down my house? You\nkilled my brother. I will avenge him. I\nkilled your brother. H I've killed a lot\nof people lately. May I ask who your\nbrother is? Leong Yuaning. He's the vice\npresident of the Three Kingdoms Heroes\nGathering. After carefully recalling the\nquestion, Fong Yu, the vice president of\nthe Three Kingdoms Heroes Gathering,\nremembered who it was and asked, \"Are\nyou talking about a big bearded man?\"\nYes. At the gates of King's Landing, the\none you burned to a crisp with your\nfireball. The woman glared at Fong Yu\nwith eyes full of hatred and shouted,\n\"You deranged killer. I'm going to kill\nyou. Hey, watch your mouth or I'll sue\nyou for defamation.\" Fongu retorted\nimpatiently. Don't you know why I killed\nyour brother? He not only instigated\nother players to steal the ruins I had\nworked so hard to conquer, but he also\ntried to kill me. My killing him was\npurely in self-defense and it was\nperfectly legal. Pa, that's just\nsophistry. You killed my brother anyway.\nUnless you kill me, I will definitely\navenge him. The woman persisted. Are you\nserious? Fongu frowned. I swear I won't\nbe a man if I don't kill you. Seeing\nthat the woman remained stubborn, Fong\nYu&lt;unk&gt;s eyes turned cold. Since that's\nthe case, then you can go and reunite\nwith your brother. After saying that,\nFong Yu was too lazy to waste any more\nwords with this woman and directly\nordered the demonic tentacle vine. Eat\nher. Upon receiving Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s\ncommand, the two tentacles wrapped\naround the woman's body tightened\ninstantly. With a sound of bones being\ncrushed, the woman coughed up a mouthful\nof blood and died completely after\nletting out a scream. The mouth parts at\nthe tips of the tentacles opened,\npreparing to devour the woman's corpse.\nDrop her backpack,\" Fongu shouted. So\nthe tentacles obediently removed the\nbackpack from the woman's body. But at\nthis moment, Olivia said, \"Master, can I\nhave this corpse?\" Upon hearing this,\nFong You stopped the demonic tentacle\nvine again and asked curiously, \"What's\nwrong?\" \"This woman has good physical\nattributes. If she were to be converted\ninto a zombie, she would be more\nsuitable for training as a soldier than\na normal human corpse,\" Olivia said\ncalmly. Fu recalled the dozen or so\ntentacles on the ground earlier. If this\nwoman had cut them all off, then\nfrankly, she was quite powerful. After\nall, the demonic tentacle vines\ndefensive capabilities were not low, and\nit was difficult for ordinary swords and\nblades to cut it. Even if it were Fong\nYu himself, it would be quite difficult\nto cut off so many tentacles in close\ncombat without using ranged magic\nattacks. It can only be said that this\nwoman chose the wrong target and came to\nthe wrong place. She encountered the\ndemonic tentacle vine which has hundreds\nof lives. It is estimated that she\neventually exhausted her skills and was\nfinally captured alive by the demonic\nvine. All right, then you can have it.\nSo Fongu had tongue put down the woman's\nbody. Although Mot was somewhat\nreluctant, it did as it was told. You\nwon't be treated unfairly. Fong Yu took\nout some yak meat from the carcasses of\nseveral yaks he had hunted on the way\nback and threw it to Mo Tong, saying,\n\"You did a good job guarding the house\nthis time, so you deserve a thumbs up.\"\nAfter eating a full 20 pieces of yak\nmeat, the demon of vine finally\nretreated back underground, satisfied.\nAt this moment, Olivia also resurrected\nthe woman's corpse. Fongu glanced at the\nmore than 30 walking corpses that Olivia\nhad also resurrected and brought back in\nthe woods behind him and said, \"Why\ndon't you do me the trouble and take\nthem to the mine together?\" Olivia\nnodded, then turned and led the zombies\ntoward the mine. Watching Olivia lead\nthe walkers into the woods, Fongu\nsecretly estimated that she had\nresurrected nearly 100 corpses in the\npast few days. If he could really train\nthese nearly 100 walkers into warriors,\nthis force would be quite powerful. Not\nto mention one against 10, one against\nthree or four should be no problem.\nHowever, this is Fong Yu's hidden trump\ncard, and he will not use it lightly\nunless absolutely necessary. After\ndealing with the woman who wanted to\nattack his manor, Fong Yu began to think\nagain about how to find the auspicious\nbeast. His strength had reached a\nbottleneck, and to break through to the\nnext level, he could only continuously\nincrease his magic power limit. Only\nafter his magic power reached 500 could\nhe be upgraded to a highle mage. If he\ncould subdue that auspicious beast, he\nmight be able to boost his combat power\nagain in a short period of time. Of\ncourse, it cannot be ruled out that the\nauspicious beasts that appear are still\nin their infancy and need to be raised.\nThe servers have just merged and\neverything is still unknown. As the\nstrongest server at present, server may\nsixth arouse the jealousy of other\nservers and be attacked by them. It's\nhard to say, but the possibility is very\nhigh. After all, as long as players\naren't stupid, they can basically guess\nthe game systems intentions from some\nclues. It must be that the system wants\nto integrate the 10 regions into one\nlarge unified region. The bottom five\nregions have basically lost their chance\nto compete. So the region that will\neventually unify the top 10 regions will\nbasically be competing among the top\nfive regions. So the question is if we\nput ourselves in Fong Yu's shoes, what\nwould he do if he were a player from a\nregion ranked second, third, fourth, or\nfifth? They'll definitely try every\npossible way to trip up the region\nthat's ranked first. Therefore, when you\ndon't know how players from other\nregions will try to sabotage your region\nsix, the best approach is to improve\nyour own strength as quickly as\npossible, using sheer power to overcome\nany challenge and adapt to any\nsituation. Chapter 136, The Secret\nLord's Meeting. Unbeknownst to him,\nFongu had already shifted his\nperspective to that of the district's\nleaders, a transformation in mindset\nthat comes with increased power. Just as\nFong Yu was wondering how players from\nother regions would deal with him,\nGeorge Connor, the lord of region 3,\nwhich ranked second in the region, had\njust started a group chat which included\nthe lords of the other eight regions\nexcept region six. George Connor became\nthe lord of district 3 not because of\nhis fighting prowess, but because of his\noutstanding political skills. Before\nentering this survival game, he was\nalready a state legislator in the United\nStates. So his ability to win people's\nhearts and build connections far\nexceeded that of ordinary people.\nThrough his careful management, he\neventually won the throne of the Lord of\nDistrict 3. At this point, someone had\nalready started speaking in the group\nchat he had initiated. Lord of District\n10, Edward Norman, Mr. Connor, is there\nsomething you want to do by suddenly\npulling all the lords of our eight\ndistricts into a group chat? Lord of\nDistrict 2, Muhammad Sharma, my time is\nprecious. Please state your intentions.\nLord of District 7, Tojo Village. George\nConnor glanced at the inquiries from the\nlords in the group, gave a cold smile,\nand began to reply. Lord of District 3,\nGeorge Connor. Dear lords, I think you\nhave noticed that there are only nine\nlords in this meeting group. I did not\ninvite any lords from district 6 to the\ngroup. So you can make your own guesses\nabout the purpose of creating this\nmeeting group. Lord of District 7, Tojo\nMurashida, your intention is to deal\nwith District 6. Lord of District 9,\nAdolf Bismar, your idea is dangerous,\nMr. George, but I am very interested in\nit. Lord of District 4, St. Paul Luther.\nMay God bless you, my friend, and please\nspeak your mind. Lord of District 3,\nGeorge Connor. I think you all know that\nDistrict 6 is currently the strongest\nand a large number of players have\napplied to transfer to District 6.\nAccording to the information I have\nreceived, the number of people in\nDistrict 6 has rebounded to nearly\n8,000. If this situation continues, it\nwill not be long before District 6\nbecomes an unshakable behemoth and\neventually sweeps away all our other\ndistricts. Lord of District 3, George\nConnor. I think that kind of ending is\nnot what you all want to see, is it? The\nmeeting group fell silent for a moment,\nbut after a while, the Lords finally\nresponded with their opinions. Lord of\nDistrict 5, Arthur Stark, I think I\nunderstand what you mean, Mr. Connor. I\nagree with you. So, what should we do?\nLord of District 7, Tojo Village. Many\nplayers in my region have chosen to\ntransfer to District 6, which makes me\nvery angry. Lord of District 9, Adolf\nBismar. I also do not want to see the\nrise of District 6. I think we can\nunite. Lord of District 1, Nicola Don,\ndestroy District 6. Divide their wealth.\nLord of District 4, St. Paul Luther.\nAlthough what you have done is immoral,\nI think God will forgive you. After all,\nDistrict 6 is full of heretics. District\n2 Lord Muhammad Sharma, when are we\ngoing to make our move? I'll gather my\nmen right now. Seeing the attitude of\nthese lords, George Connor smiled with\nsatisfaction. Just as he had expected,\nthese lords shared his thoughts and\nwanted to dethrone District 6, which was\nranked number one. Lord of District 3,\nGeorge Connor, calm down, my friends.\nI've already come up with a plan. If\nyou're willing to cooperate, I think\ntaking down district 6 should be a piece\nof cake. District 3 Lord George Connor.\nBut before that, I think we should come\nup with a respectable reason. After all,\nas a righteous coalition, we need a\nlegitimate cause. Lord of District 7,\nTojo Village. I know this one well. Just\nthen, a message popped up in the group\nchat. Lord of District 8, Vladimir\nViking. Sorry, I'm not interested in\nyour plans. Lord of District 8, Vladimir\nViking has left the group chat. Upon\nseeing the message that he had left the\ngroup chat, George Connor frowned. He\ndidn't understand why any lord would be\nuninterested in his plan. But when he\nsaw the name of the lord of district 8,\nhe gasped in shock. Vladimir Viking.\nIsn't that the leader of the Russian\nbear country? Unexpectedly, he was also\nteleported into this survival game. In\nan instant, a fine bead of sweat\nappeared on George Connor&lt;unk&gt;s\nforehead. The presence of such a\nlegendary figure greatly increased the\npressure on George Connor. In fact, it\nis no exaggeration to say that the\npressure from Vladimir Viking alone was\nenough to match the combined pressure\nfrom the entire district 6, which was\nranked number one. After all, before\neveryone transmigrated into the game,\nthis leader of the Russian bear country\nwas a formidable figure who\nsingle-handedly resisted the entire\nwestern forces. At this moment, George\nConnor also understood why Vladimir\nViking was no longer interested in the\nplan to siege district 6 because he was\na proud man, an emperor who refused to\nsubmit. A moment later, someone spoke up\nagain in the group chat. Lord of\nDistrict 9, Adolf Bismar. Mr. George\nConnor, I think we should adjust our\nstrategic objectives. Lord of District\n7, Tojo Village, take District 8 first.\nTake District 8 first. I think District\n8 is more dangerous than District 6.\nDamn it. I can't believe I'm stuck\nbetween these two districts. Lord of\nDistrict 2, Muhammad Sharma. If\ndistricts 6 and 8 unite, our chances of\nwinning will undoubtedly decrease\nsignificantly. After all, that's\nVladimir Viking. Lord of District 1,\nNicola Don, how about we take out\nDistrict 8 first? Lord of District 4,\nSt. Paul Luther. Oh, merciful God, I\nthink we can launch a covert\ndecapitation operation against that guy\nin District 8 first. What do you think,\nLord of District 7, Tojo Village? Great\nidea. Lord of District 9, Adolf Bismar.\nGood idea. Lord of District 2, Muhammad\nSharma. Let's do it. After carefully\nconsidering the messages from the lords\nand the group, George Connor agreed with\ntheir views. After all, District 6 only\nhad a temporary advantage in numbers,\nwhich could be suppressed by the Allied\nforces. However, if the emperor was\nallowed to develop peacefully, no one\nknew how powerful the emperor would\nbuild District 8 into. So, George Connor\nreplied in the group chat, \"Lord of\nDistrict 3, George Connor. In that case,\nlet's change our plans and send our men\nto District 7 and 9 to try and take down\nthe one in District 8 first. Lord of\nDistrict 3, George Connor. As for\nDistrict 6, I believe that once we\neliminate District 8, the biggest\nthreat, District 6 will naturally be\nwithin our grasp. Thus, this secret lord\nmeeting quickly reached a consensus and\na surging undercurrent was about to\nsweep across all regions. After the\nsecret lord meeting ended, Lord St. Paul\nLuther of District 4 turned off the chat\nchannel, turned around and looked at a\nhuge statue carved from a single piece\nof white jade on the high platform.\nSlightly lost in thought, the statue\ndepicts an elderly man with a long beard\nwhose features are obscured. The statue\nemits a faint white light as if it were\na compassionate deity. In fact, this is\nalso a statue of a god. And the place\nwhere St. Paul is located is a church\ndedicated to the god of light. St. Paul\nlooked at the light emanating from the\nstatue. A slight smirk playing on his\nlips and murmured, \"God, God of light,\nit doesn't matter to me. As long as you\ncan help me rule this world, I will\nserve you well.\" At that moment, someone\nbehind St. Paul spoke up. My lord, what\nshould we do next? The speaker was a\nsword wielding player who appeared\nstrong and powerful, indicating\nconsiderable skill. Besides the player\nwith the sword, there were 10 other\nplayers standing below the steps. They\nwere the strongest players in zone 4, or\nrather the strongest players in zone 4\nwho were willing to submit to Sao Paulo\nand survive. After thinking for a\nmoment, Sao Paulo recounted the contents\nof the Lord's meeting to the players and\nthen asked, \"Do you think we should deal\nwith District 8 first or District 6?\"\nAfter a brief discussion, most of the\npeople in the audience supported forming\na united front with the other regions to\ndeal with District 8. \"My thoughts are a\nlittle different from yours,\" Sao Paulo\nsaid with a smile. \"I think we should\ndeal with District 6 first.\" \"Why?\" a\nplayer in the audience asked in\nconfusion. The Lord of District 8 is a\nViking. If we don't take him down soon,\nwe're all doomed. No, no, no. St. Paul\nshook his head and said, \"The Vikings\nare terrible, but we have a more\nimportant enemy.\" \"The most important\nenemy? What do you mean?\" St. Paul\npointed to the statue behind him and\nsaid, \"The God of Light told me that\nthere is a spokesperson for the God of\nDarkness hiding among us players. I need\nto find him and defeat him.\" the\nspokesperson for the god of darkness.\nWhy would there be a spokesperson for\nthe god of darkness? What kind of guy is\nhe? The players in the audience were\nbuzzing with discussion. Sa Paulo\nsneered. No matter who he is, I will\ncrush him. Response measures number 137.\nThe afternoon of the first day of spring\nin the second year. Just as Fong Yu was\nrecovering his magic power through\nmeditation, Song Jimming suddenly sent a\nbarrage of messages directly\ninterrupting Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s meditation.\nFong Yu remembered reminding Song\nJimming that he should handle things\nnormally in King's Landing himself and\nonly come to him if he couldn't handle\nthem. So, what could have prompted Song\nJimming to bombard him with a series of\nmessages? Fongu frowned and opened the\ninformation bar. Song jamming ID 3533.\nBoss calling the boss. Song jamming ID\n3533. Important information. Important\ninformation. Important information. Song\njamming ID 3533. Please reply\nimmediately upon receipt. Over. Fongu\nreplied impatiently. Fong UD006.\nWhat are you doing? Spit it out. Song\njamming ID 3533. Ya. You finally\nreplied. I was so anxious. Songing\nID3533.\nI just received some fantastic news and\nsome fantastic bad news. Which do you\nwant to hear first? Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s heart\nskipped a beat when he saw this. Had the\nauspicious beast in the district been\ndiscovered and stolen by someone else?\nWas this a mix of good and bad news?\nFong Yu hurriedly replied, \"Fong UID006.\nIf you keep keeping me in suspense like\nthis, believe me, I'll go to King's\nLanding and beat you up. Song jamming ID\n3533. Okay. Okay. The good news is that\nthe Lord of District 8 wants to form a\nstrategic partnership with our district.\nBut that's not the point. The point is,\ndo you know who the Lord of District 8\nis? It's actually Vladimir Viking. Fongu\nwas also startled when he saw this\nmessage. After all, he had heard of the\nViking Emperor very well. But just to be\non the safe side, he asked again. Fong\nYu ID00006.\nCould it be someone with the same name?\nSong Jiming ID 3533. No, it's&lt;unk&gt; the\nViking king himself. He also said he\nhopes to have a meeting with me sometime\nto discuss the specific details of our\ncooperation. Funu frowned. If it really\nwas the Viking emperor himself, then the\nmatter of forming an alliance would\nindeed become a mixed blessing. On the\nsurface, having such a top tier ally is\nindeed a very good thing. The problem is\nthat the opponent is just too top tier.\nWhether it's political tactics, war\nstrategies, or operational and\ndevelopment capabilities, they are all\nat maximum level. Wait, then why didn't\nhis district 8 achieve first place under\nhis leadership? Fong Yu then shared this\nquestion with Song Jaming, who replied\nthat region 8 did not only have the\nRussian Bear Kingdom as a country. Most\nareas had players from several\ncountries. The Vikings had launched\nseveral large-scale military operations\nto unify region 8, resulting in the\ndeaths of many players, which caused the\nranking to drop. In fact, there are also\nsome players from southern Myanmar,\nnorthern Vietnam, and Korea in District\n6. But their numbers are relatively\nsmall, and Fong Yu doesn't usually pay\nattention to them, so he doesn't know\nabout them. On the surface, although\ndistrict 6 is currently ranked first,\nFong Yu is absolutely certain that\ndistrict 8 will quickly surpass District\n6 under the leadership of this big shot,\nat which point his side will become the\nweaker party. Fongu understood a\nprinciple very well. There are no\npermanent allies between countries, only\npermanent interests, and the same is\ntrue between regions nowadays. The\nViking Emperor may be eyeing the current\nnumber one position in District 6. So,\nhe's extending an olive branch to them.\nHowever, it remains to be seen whether\nDistrict 6 will still be their ally once\nDistrict 8 has developed. Just as Fong\nYu was frowning and pondering the pros\nand cons, Song Jimming sent another\nmessage. Song Jimming ID 3533.\nAll right, there's also bad news. The\nViking emperor told me that the lords of\nthe other eight regions have formed an\nalliance in a secret meeting initiated\nby the lord of region 3. An alliance\naimed at our region 6 jamming ID 3533.\nThe Viking emperor was also pulled into\nthat secret meeting, but he didn't\nchoose to join the alliance and\nimmediately informed us. He told our\ndistrict to quickly develop a response\nplan. Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s face darkened after\nseeing the message. He had considered\nthat other regions might target his\nregion. After all, the nail that sticks\nout gets hammered down, and it's normal\nfor someone to be envious of someone\nwho's ranked first. But he didn't expect\nthat bastard Lord of District 3 would\nhold a secret meeting to discuss how to\ndeal with his district and even form an\nalliance. This is absolutely outrageous.\nFong Yu frowned and asked again with a\nserious expression. Fongu ID006,\nis this news reliable? Song Jimming ID\n3533. Although there is no concrete news\nyet, from an objective point of view,\nthe Viking king has no reason to deceive\nus. Fongu thought about it and realized\nit made sense. If the Viking Emperor was\nlying to him, what was his purpose? Was\nit just to force him into a strategic\nalliance? That was completely\nunnecessary. Funu opened the regional\ndistribution map provided by the system\nand glanced at it. Currently, the 10\nregions are connected end to end in a\ncircular shape. The region in the middle\nof the ring is unknown, as are the\nregions outside the ring. The unknown\nregion at the center of the ring is west\nof King's Landing, and the unknown\nregion outside the ring is east of\nKing's Landing. Leaving aside the\nboundaries of the unknown areas, the\nboundaries at the intersections with\nzones 5 and 7 are key locations that\nneed to be defended. Fong Yu ID 006\nimmediately sends someone to the border\nconnecting zones five and seven to try\nand obtain accurate information and also\nto investigate the movements in those\ntwo zones. If all else fails, you can\ntry to bribe some people from other\nzones in the world chat. We must get\naccurate information as soon as\npossible. Song jamming ID 3533.\nUnderstood. I've already arranged all of\nthese things. What I'm worried about now\nis that our King's Landing is only half\nbuilt and the main construction is of\ncivilian facilities. Apart from the\ndragon slayer ballista you gave me last\ntime, we don't have any defensive\nfacilities. Song jamming ID 3533.\nMoreover, we just finished a winter and\nthe city supplies are running low. We\nhave to allocate a large number of\npeople to go out and collect supplies.\nI'm worried that if those eight\ndistricts attack all at once, we won't\nbe able to hold out. After a moment's\nthought, Fong Yu replied, \"Fong UID006,\nyou should arrange for people to collect\nsupplies as usual. Suspend the\nconstruction of civilian facilities in\nthe city, build some defensive\nfacilities, and I'll figure out the\nrest.\" Song Jiming ID 3533. Okay. What\ndid the Viking Emperor say? Should we\nstill form an alliance? Fong Yu ID006.\nGiven this situation, do we have any\nother choice? We have to form an\nalliance. Let him keep an eye on the\nmovements in district 7 so we can focus\non defending district 5. Song jamming ID\nOkay, I understand. Immediately, Fong Yu\nexited the chat interface, quickly\ngathered his equipment, and went to the\nliving room. After calling out to Alpha,\nthe two of them swiftly ran towards the\nhaunted mine. He needs to activate the\nzombie unit that Olivia has assembled\nimmediately. Chapter 138, assembling the\nWalking Dead army. Faced with this\nimpending large-scale invasion, his\nindividual strength was already very\nlimited, and he had to start making use\nof the zombie army that Olivia had\nassembled. I wonder how well Olivia has\ntrained those zombies. When Fong Yu and\nGuyie arrived at the mine, they saw\nOlivia standing in the center directing\ndozens of zombies lined up in formation.\nThese zombies were the players Fong Yu\nhad just killed that morning who had\nambushed him. \"How many walkers do we\nhave in total?\" Fong Yu asked, walking\ndirectly to Olivia. Olivia seemed\nsomewhat surprised by Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s\narrival. After thinking for a moment,\nshe replied, \"There are currently 72\nhuman zombies and 45 pigheaded zombies.\nHow many of them can form a fighting\nforce? Apart from the 35 human zombies\nthat were just converted today and are\nnot yet combat capable, the other\nzombies already possess basic combat\ncapabilities. What level of combat\ncapability does this simple skill level\nrepresent? They can form simple\nformations, slash and charge. If you\ntake into account their own resilience,\none human zombie can fight against two\nto three humans, and one pig-headed\nzombie can fight against three to four\nhumans, but they need to be equipped\nwith weapons.\" Olivia felt a little\nstrange as she answered, \"Why was her\nmaster suddenly starting to care about\nthe combat capabilities of these\nzombies?\" Without saying a word, Fong Yu\nwalked straight into the ghost's cabin,\ntook out all the iron ingots he had\nrefined over the past year from the iron\nbox inside, and brought them to the\ncrafting table. There were more than\n1,900\ningots in total, ready to start making\nweapons for these zombies. At this\nmoment, Fongu seemed to remember\nsomething and asked, \"As for weapons,\nwhich type would you recommend equipping\nthem with?\" Olivia paused for a moment\nbefore replying. Human zombies can be\narmed with swords, axes, and spears, but\nfor pigheaded people, I suggest adding a\ngiant shield. It will be very effective\nfor both charging and defense. Fongu\nnodded and directly crafted 50 iron long\nswords, 50 iron long knives, and 50\nwooden spears. The cost of crafting the\nlong knives and long knives was four\niron ingots plus one wooden stick, while\nthe cost of crafting the wooden spears\nwas two iron ingots plus one piece of\nwood. This cost a total of 480 iron\ningots. He then found the option to\ncraft giant wooden shields and made 45\ngiant shields, each costing four wood\nand one iron ingot. Each weapon takes 5\nminutes to craft. So, the total crafting\ntime adds up to 1,000 minutes, which is\nmore than 16 hours. However, Fong Yu's\ncrafting table has reached its limit.\nSo, he had to contact Song Jumming and\nmail him the iron ingots to ask him to\nhelp craft them. Fortunately, these\nweapons and equipment were all of white\nquality, so there was no need to create\nblueprints. Even so, Fong Yu lost nearly\na third of the iron ingots he had saved\nup over the past year. Should we equip\nthem with some more protective gear?\nFong Yu thought for a moment and then\nasked. After all, although they are\nrelatively resistant to blows, they can\nstill be knocked down. Olivia nodded and\nsaid, \"Their biggest weaknesses are\ntheir head and neck. If their head is\ndestroyed, they lose their senses and\ncannot find their enemies. If their neck\nis cut off, they will lose control of\ntheir body. Therefore, the most suitable\narmor for them is the head plate of\nchain mail, which can protect both the\nhead and neck. Let me see the chain\nmail. Fong Yu quickly found the chain\nmail crafting option on the crafting\ntable, but to his surprise, it was only\nof green quality. A crafting blueprint\nwas required. Nema. So, Fongu went to\nthe exchange to search for the blueprint\nfor chain mail, but it seemed that no\none in this region had obtained such a\nblueprint, and there were no finished\nproducts for sale. Helpless, Fongu had\nto start searching in the inter regional\ntrading. At this moment, Olivia finally\ncouldn't hold back her questions and\nasked, \"Master, why have you suddenly\nbecome so concerned about these zombies?\nAnd why are you equipping them with so\nmuch gear all at once?\" Fongu sighed and\nreplied, \"Well, there's nothing we can\ndo. In the next few days, a large number\nof enemies may invade our territory.\" A\nlarge number? Well, conservatively\nspeaking, there should be at least 1,000\npeople and possibly as many as 3,000 or\n5,000. So, I have to get this zombie\narmy equipped as soon as possible.\"\nAfter listening to Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s\nexplanation, Olivia understood and\nnodded, saying, \"If that's the case,\nthen these zombies aren't enough. What\ncan we do?\" Fongu said helplessly. \"I\ndidn't expect to suddenly face so many\nenemies.\" Olivia turned to look at the\nmine shaft leading underground and said,\n\"I've heard you say that a group of cave\ndwarves live beneath this mine.\"\nOlivia's reminder prompted Fong Yu to\nraise an eyebrow. Realizing a\npossibility, he guessed, \"You mean you\nwant to hunt those dwarf demons\nunderground and then resurrect them as\nzombies?\" Olivia nodded and said,\n\"Although the dwarf demons are the\nlowest ranking race among demons, they\nare still much stronger than humans or\neven orcs. If they were resurrected as\nzombies, the combat power of one dwarf\nzombie would be equivalent to that of 10\nordinary soldiers. Fong Yu recalled the\ndwarf's height of over 2 m, nearly 3 m,\nits muscular physique, and its extremely\ndurable demon patterned skin. It was\nindeed a born powerful warrior. If he\ncould have a hundred or so dwarf zombies\nas an army, then dealing with those\nplayers invading from other regions\nshouldn't be a big problem, right?\nThinking of this, Fa was also somewhat\ntempted. After all, it was too late to\nimprove his individual strength now, and\nthere were no other better targets\nnearby to turn into zombies. Therefore,\nthe dwarf demons underground became Fong\nYu's only source of reinforcements at\npresent. However, those dwarves are all\nhiding in the underground palace, and\nthere is also a Titan cat in the\nunderground palace. That giant cat is\nnot something that Fong Yu and Olivia\ncan deal with now. So, if they want to\nkill those dwarves, they have to lure\nthem out of the underground palace. No\nproblem. The hole in the underground\npalace wall is only 1 meter in diameter.\nThat giant cat shouldn't be able to get\nout. We can handle it. Anyway, the\ncrafting station still has 4 hours to\ncomplete all the equipment, so it's not\na bad idea to go down and make a quick\nbuck during that time. Without further\nado, Fongu waved his hand and said, \"All\nright, let's set off.\" Chapter 139.\nHeading to the underground palace to\nhunt down the cave dwarf demon. Not long\nafter descending into the mine, Fong Yu\nencountered the ghosts mining as well as\nother walking corpses also mining. Upon\nseeing the ghosts, Fongu stepped forward\nand smiled. The one-year agreement you\nmade with me has been fulfilled. You no\nlonger need to mine for me. Didn't I\ntell you a few days ago that I've\nalready taken Yorktown back from the\norcs? You can all go up and wait for me\nlater. After I finish dealing with\nmatters in the underground world, I'll\ntake your remains to Yorktown for a\nproper burial. Upon hearing Fong\nYu&lt;unk&gt;s words, the ghosts all smiled\ngratefully. Steve, the leader of the\nghosts, stepped forward and said, \"Mr.\nFong Yu, we are extremely grateful for\nyour keeping your promise.\" Although\nbeing buried in the Yorktown cemetery\nwas our long cherished wish, we have\nbecome less attached to that wish since\nlearning of Yorktown's destruction. So\nwhat you mean is? He Steve chuckled and\nsaid, \"We've all discussed it. Even if\nwe bring our remains back to the\ndestroyed Yorktown for burial, we won't\nbe able to rest in peace looking at that\nsorrowful place every day. So it's\nbetter not to go back. Besides, we've\nlived here for a hundred years and have\ndeveloped a deep affection for this\nmine, so we might as well stay here and\ncontinue to do our part for you. After\nlistening to Steve's words, Fun Yu also\nfelt some sympathy for these ghosts.\nIndeed, their homeland had been\ndestroyed, so what was the point of\ngoing back? At this point, Steve added,\n\"Actually, we also have a favor to ask.\"\nFongu raised an eyebrow slightly and\nsaid, \"Speak freely. We hope to avenge\nour family. A fierce glint appeared in\nSteve's eyes. We know that with the\nstrength of just a few ghosts like us,\nwe can never kill the dragon that\ndestroyed our homeland. Therefore, we\nimplore you, if you have the opportunity\nto help us take revenge and kill that\nevil dragon. You have triggered the\nhaunted mine caves scenario quest. Final\nchapter. Fulfill the final request of\nthe miner's ghosts and slay the dragon\nthat destroyed Yorktown. Quest reward.\nYou will gain the eternal allegiance of\nthe mind's ghosts. Accept the quest.\nSeeing the sudden notification, Fong Yu\nraised an eyebrow. This mission was\nactually to kill a dragon. This is quite\ndifficult. Fortunately, this scenario\nmission has no time limit, so I don't\nneed to slay the dragon now. I can wait\nuntil my strength has improved further\nbefore considering it. Moreover, even if\nthe ghosts hadn't made this request,\nFongu would have taken action against\nthat dragon sooner or later. After all,\nthat guy was too close to his base camp,\nand Fong Yu wouldn't feel at ease until\nit was dead. Therefore, Fong Yu readily\nagreed. So, he said to Ghost Steve, \"No\nproblem. I promise you, as long as I\nhave the chance, I will definitely kill\nthat evil dragon and avenge you.\" Upon\nhearing Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s reply, the ghost\nsmiled gratefully once again and thanked\nhim profusely. \"No need to thank me\nyet.\" Fong Yu waved his hand and said,\n\"You can thank me after I've avenged\nyou.\" At this point, Fong Yu suddenly\nremembered that he had Valentina forged\n10 soul blades for these ghosts. With\nthese soul blades, the ghosts actually\nhad considerable combat power. So, he\nsaid, \"I'm going down to kill a group of\ncave dwarfs now. Those guys are actually\nyour enemies, too. So, do you want to\ncome with me?\" Funu's words immediately\npiqu the interest of the ghosts. They\nhated the evil dragon that had destroyed\ntheir homeland. And they also hated the\ndwarfs of the dungeon who had caused\ntheir deaths. So they all dropped their\npickaxes, excitedly rubbing their hands\ntogether, indicating their willingness\nto go down together. Seeing the ghosts\ndance, Fongu smiled slightly. For those\ndwarf demons who only knew how to use\nclubs for physical attacks, weren't\nthese ghosts who were immune to physical\nattacks their nemesis? So Fong Yu along\nwith two companions and 10 ghosts\nmarched in a grand procession into the\nunderground world. Because Fong Yu\nfrequently goes to the underground world\nto trade with the rat king, the ghost\nminers thoughtfully built a fairly\nwell-maintained staircase down the steep\nslope of the cliff. So Fong Yu no longer\nhas to worry about holding onto the wall\nas he walks down. Soon, the group\narrived at the rat king's lair. The rat\nking, who was lying in the middle of the\ncave, saw that it was Fong Yu and\nimmediately got up from the ground and\nran to Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s side to fawn over\nhim. \"Sorry, we're&lt;unk&gt; not here to\ntrade with you today. We have other\nthings to do.\" Fongu took a few pieces\nof roasted meat from his backpack and\nplaced them in front of the rat king.\n\"Consider these pieces of meat a small\ngift. I'll need you to take your people\nand help me clear a path later.\" The rat\nking, who was pouncing on the roasted\nmeat, tilted its head upon hearing this,\nwondering what Fong Yu was planning to\ndo. Take your people and come with me\nfirst. Immediately, Fongu led his group\nand the rats to the passage that he had\nblasted open with explosives last time.\nHe pointed to the passage buried under\nrubble and said to the rat king, \"Have\nyour people move these rubble away.\" So\nthe rat king called out along with the\nrock rats around him and hundreds of\nrats immediately swarmed forward\nstarting to gnaw and carry away the\nrubble. 10 minutes later the rock rats\nopened a gap in the blocked passage and\nFongu led his companions and the ghosts\ninside. Before leaving, Fong Yu said to\nthe rat king, \"I'm going to kill some\ncave dwarves. Want to come along?\" Upon\nhearing this, the rat king immediately\nshook his little head like a rattled\ndrum. He he I knew you wouldn't dare to\ngo. Funu laughed. How about this? As\nlong as you're willing to come and help\nwith your people, I'll give you 50\npieces of meat afterward free of charge.\nWhat do you say? Upon hearing this, the\nrat king hesitated. Don't worry, we're\nnot asking you to fight the dwarfs. You\njust need to run around and make some\nnoise. We'll take care of the fighting.\nAfter hearing Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s explanation,\nthe rat king reluctantly agreed, nodded,\nand led the horde of rats to follow\nbehind Fong Yu. So, Fong Yu led his two\ncompanions and the ghosts toward the\nunderground palace. In fact, on the way\nhere, Fongu had already figured out how\nto deal with those dwarf demons. First\nof all, those dwarf demons have very\npoor eyesight and basically rely on\nhearing to determine the location of\nenemies. That's why Fong Yu wanted the\nrat king to command the rat swarm to run\naround nearby and create a lot of noise\nto confuse the dwarf demons. This would\ngreatly reduce the dwarf demons ability\nto make judgments. Then the ghosts, who\nare immune to physical attacks, will be\nthe main force to assassinate the\ndwarves, while Fongu, Alpha, and Olivia\nwill only need to deal with any\nemergencies. All the plans had been\narranged and soon everyone arrived at\nthe magnificent underground palace. I\nwonder how many dwarf demons will come\nout this time. Fong Yu wondered with\nsome anticipation. Chapter 140. The\nhunt. When Fong Yu followed his memory\nto the hole in the corner of the wall,\nhe found that the hole had actually been\nrebuilt. However, upon closer\nhole was not made of bricks, but of mud\nmixed with weeds, which looked like a\nhuge and ugly yellowish brown patch.\nFongu glanced at the perfectly fitted\nand neatly arranged brown brick wall\nnext to him, and frowned. The difference\nbetween the wall repairing skills and\nthe wall building skills was too great.\nSo, Fong, you couldn't help but have a\nguess. Could it be that this underground\npalace wasn't built by the dwarf demons?\nor were they just residing inside? At\nthis moment, Fun Yu thought of the giant\ncat again. He remembered that when the\ngame assistant gave him a hint, it said\nthat the cat was a pet of the Titans.\nTherefore, this magnificent palace was\nvery likely built by the Titans.\nCongratulations, you guessed correctly.\nThis underground palace is indeed a\ncreation of the Titans. Um, Fongu was\nslightly taken aback and asked the game\nassistant, \"Why didn't you say so\nearlier? According to the game rules, I\ncannot reveal information about this\nworld to you in advance. I can only\nprovide hints after you have figured it\nout yourself. And you even gave me\nadvanced notice of the game's later\nquests. Information about later stages\nof the game that don't belong to this\nworld can be revealed in advance. I see.\nIf that's the case, then the treasure in\nthis underground palace might not just\nbe the gold and silver treasures in the\nvault. there's a high probability that\nit contains divine artifacts. Even if\nthere aren't divine artifacts, there\nshould at least be legendary or epic\nlevel treasures. Thinking about this,\nFongu began to consider whether he\nshould clear out all the dwarf demons in\nthe dungeon, then try to kill the Titan\ncat or subdue it and then go to the\ndungeon to find treasures. Friendly\nreminder, with your current strength,\nyou are not yet able to defeat the Titan\ncat, let alone subdue it. this. Let's\nskip this one and get down to business\nfirst. He came down here to hunt down\ndwarves and build an army of zombies.\nAfter that, he needs to hurry out to\nfind the whereabouts of the auspicious\nbeast. As for the giant cat and the\ntreasure in the underground palace, I'll\ndeal with those after I've improved my\nstrength. Therefore, the most urgent\ntask is to remove the mud sealing the\ncave entrance and lure the dwarf demons\nout. As for how to do it, digging with a\npickaxe is time-consuming and laborious.\nLet's use a bomb. If we blow up the hole\nand let that Titan cat escape, that\nwould be a real mess. So Fong, you had\nno choice but to send the Rat King's\npeople out again. It has to be said that\nalthough these rock rats were extremely\ntimid, their teeth were really good.\nThey could gnaw on rocks as easily as\ngnaw on nuts, and they were even more\nruthless when it came to gnawing on the\nmud wall in front of them. They nod\nthrough the mud wall in less than a\nminute. \"Awesome,\" Fun Yu exclaimed,\nlooking at the efficiency with which\nthese rock rats were digging through the\nwall. \"This speed is like a flesh and\nblood excavator,\" Olivia explained.\nRockrats teeth grow very fast, so they\nhave to wear down their overgrown teeth\nby gnawing on rocks everyday, whether in\nthe soil or in Rocky Mountains. Their\nburrowing ability is topnotch. I\nremember that the dwarves really liked\nto keep these rock rats to help them\nburrow and mine in the mountains and\neven carve rocks. After hearing Olivia's\nexplanation, Fongu seemed to realize\nsomething and turned to the rat king,\nasking, \"Can you gnaw rocks into any\nshape you want?\" The rat king was\nslightly taken aback, then nodded\nconfidently. So Fong, you opened the\nexchange, searched around, and then\nbought a large stone brick 50 cm, x 20\ncm, x 10 cm for 20 wood through cross\nregion trading. He placed it in front of\nthe rat king and asked, \"Can you gnaw a\nstone into this shape?\" After circling\nthe large stone brick, the rat king\nnodded again. Fongu smiled slightly.\nHere comes the cheap stonemason. So he\nsaid, \"Perfect timing. I've noticed that\nyou're collecting fewer and fewer ores\nand crystals lately when we're trading.\nYou could process these stone bricks\nspecifically for me. Five large stone\nbricks for one piece of roasted meat.\nInterested? Upon hearing that there was\nroasted meat to trade, the rat king\nimmediately became interested and\nnodded. Although the simple-minded rat\ndidn't know if the exchange rate was\nworthwhile, it was willing to do it as\nlong as there was roasted meat to trade.\nAnyway, it's not the creature that does\nthe work. It's its subjects. In fact, a\nsingle adult rock rat can gnaw through\nthese stone bricks in just 3 hours. Five\nrock rats can exchange 3 hours for a\npiece of meat. The rat king's rat troop\nhas more than 300 adult rock rats. If\nthey all work together, they can earn 60\npieces of roasted meat in just 3 hours a\nday. This is actually more profitable\nthan mining for ore and exchanging it\nfor roasted meat. The reason Fong Yu\nwanted Rockrats to make these large\nstone bricks was because the damaged\nwalls of King's Landing could not be\nfully repaired due to a lack of these\nbricks. These large stone bricks could\nonly be made by players who had changed\ntheir profession to stonemason and\nstonemason was an advanced profession of\nminor. Currently, there were too few of\nthem. So, large stone bricks were always\nin short supply. What's the real value\nof a rock? The processing fee is what's\nvaluable. It's selling for 20 units of\ntimber on the market and the price is\nstill rising. Now things are much better\nwith these rock rats processing stone\nbricks. One piece of cumin roasted meat\ncan be exchanged for five large stone\nbricks. That's equivalent to exchanging\n12 pieces of wood for 100 pieces of\nwood, earning nearly 10 times the profit\nthrough tears and blood. What's this\ncalled? This is called a win-win\nsituation. Tsk tisk. I'm a damn business\ngenius. Funu praised himself. Of course,\nthis was just a side note. After\nfinishing his deal with the rat king\nregarding the large stone bricks, Fongu\nturned his attention back to hunting\ndown the dwarf demons in the crypt. At\nthis moment, the holes in the wall that\nhad been covered with mud had been\ngnawed open by the rats. But to lure the\ndwarf out, they still needed to make\nnoise so that the dwarf inside would\nnotice. So, Fong, you had the rat king\narrange for the rats to crowd to the\nentrance of the hole and start squealing\nwildly. For a moment, the chirping of\nmice echoed in the burrow, making Fong\nuse eardrums ache. Of course, this was\nvery effective. Soon, heavy footsteps\nand deep roars echoed through the cave.\nSoon, illuminated by the torch light,\nFong Yu saw a green dwarf demon appear\nin the cave entrance. Seeing that the\nrepaired cave entrance had broken open\nagain and hearing the chattering of the\nrats outside, the dwarf demon roared and\ndragged its club out of the cave\nentrance, swinging it at the rats. Upon\nseeing this, the rats scattered in all\ndirections. Taking advantage of this\nopportunity, Fongu drew his bow and shot\nan arrow at the dwarf's arm holding the\nclub. Olivia, who was standing nearby,\nhad already rushed over and swung her\niron ax at the dwarf's knee. A woo!\nAfter a scream, the dwarf's wrist, which\nwas holding the club, was struck by an\narrow. In pain, it dropped the club\nwhile Olivia smashed the dwarf's knees\nwith her iron ax, and the dwarf's tall\nfigure crashed to the ground. After\nfalling to the ground, the dwarf began\nto howl in pain, which was exactly what\nFongu wanted. He needed the dwarf's howl\nto attract more dwarfs. To make the\ndwarf scream louder and in more pain,\nOlivia continued to smash its arm bones\nwith the iron axe. Amidst the dwarf's\nagonizing howls, heavy rapid footsteps\nsoon echoed from the cave entrance. Upon\nhearing the sound, Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s lips\ncurled slightly, and he took out three\nmore feathered arrows and knocked them\nonto the horntooth bow. The hunt has\nbegun. Chapter 141. The Undead Legion.\nSparta. To prevent the dwarves from\nsurging out in large numbers and forming\nan unstoppable battle, Olivia stood by\nthe cave entrance. Every time a dwarf\nemerged, she would precisely smash its\nknee with her iron ax while Fong use\narrows followed closely behind, aiming\nfor vital organs such as the dwarf's\nthroat or eyes. Alpha was responsible\nfor dealing with the fallen dwarfs. The\ntwo of them and the dog had a clear\ndivision of labor and were extremely\nefficient. Almost every dwarf that\nappeared was taken down and killed\nwithin seconds. They didn't even give\nthe 10 ghost miners floating nearby a\nchance to make a move. But soon, the\nground at the cave entrance was piled up\nwith the corpses of more than a dozen\ndwarves. And Olivia, with nowhere to\nstep, was forced to retreat, which\nfinally gave the dwarves inside the cave\na chance to pour out in large numbers.\nFortunately, these dwarf demons were\nrather dull-witted. Once they came out,\nthey lost their ability to distinguish\nthemselves because of the noisy and\nrunning rock rats around them. They\nstarted frantically smashing things\naround with their clubs and sometimes\neven hit their own companions. Funu\nmeanwhile continued to calmly fire\nmultiple arrows at the dwarves. The\nreason for not using fire and wind magic\nis twofold. First, the dwarf skin\nprovides some resistance to magic,\nespecially fire magic, which is almost\nineffective. Second, Fong Yu still needs\nto use the dwarf's corpses. If they are\nburned to a crisp or cut into pieces by\nwind blades, it will be troublesome for\nOlivia to revive them. The arrows are\npowerful yet leave small wounds, making\nthem the best weapon against these\ndwarfs. Faced with the everinccreasing\nnumber of dwarf demons, the 10 ghosts\nwho had been waiting for a long time\nfinally had their chance to act. Upon\nseeing these dwarf demons, they recalled\ntheir tragic deaths years ago and red\nlight began to emerge from their\noriginally grayish blue souls. They all\ntook the soul blades that Fu had given\nthem and charged towards the dwarf\ndemons. These ghosts completely ignored\nthe clubs wielded by the dwarves,\nraising their soul blades and stabbing\nthem into their bodies. Strangely, the\nsoul blades did not cause any real\ndamage to the dwarves bodies after\npiercing them. But the dwarves let out\nscreams far more agonizing than those\ncaused by being struck by an iron axe or\nshot by an arrow because that soul blade\ncan directly damage the souls of the\ndwarfs. It's equivalent to true damage\nthat ignores defense. Soon, a large\nnumber of dwarves fell to the ground,\nhowling in pain, and quickly died under\nthe attack of the ghosts. Upon\nwitnessing this scene, Fong Yu and\nOlivia even stopped their attack,\nallowing the 10 ghosts to relentlessly\nslaughter the dwarfs. After all, the\nghosts wouldn't harm the dwarves bodies,\nbut would directly kill their souls,\nthus preserving the dwarf's corpses\nintact. After a massacre that lasted for\nmore than 10 minutes, no more new dwarf\ndemons emerged from the hole in the wall\nof the underground palace. At this time,\nthe open space outside the hole was\npiled with the corpses of the dwarf\ndemons. Funu counted them and found that\nthere were more than 150. Fongu\noriginally planned to hunt down about\n100 dwarf demons, but now he has killed\nmore than 50 more than he expected. So,\nhe was satisfied and not greedy. He\ndirectly asked the rat king to call the\nrat swarm to retreat. Olivia then began\nto revive the dwarf corpses on the\nground one by one. Reviving dwarves\ntakes much longer than killing them.\nAfter all, killing them might only take\na few axe blows, a few arrows, or a few\nslashes. But resurrecting them requires\nOlivia to slowly infuse the corpses with\nundead energy and repair the more\nseriously injured ones. Therefore, it\ntook nearly 2 hours to revive these 155\ndwarf corpses. During this time, Fong Yu\nand Alfa circled the perimeter of the\nunderground palace and discovered that\nit was much larger than they had\nimagined. One wall alone was nearly 1 km\nlong, and the other three walls were\nhidden in the rock and could not be\nseen. But they were estimated to be\nabout 1 km long as well. Therefore,\nstrictly speaking, this should be\nconsidered an underground city. Such a\nlarge underground city must be home to\nmore than just 100 dwarfs. There must be\na large number of cave dwarves or even\nother monsters such as that titan cat.\nTherefore, Fong Yu secretly decided that\nonce he was strong enough, he would\ndefinitely explore this underground\npalace. Putting everything else aside,\nas long as he could defeat that Titan\ncat, the mountain of gold, and the\nmountain of magic crystals in that\ntreasure vault would be his. After\nOlivia resurrected all 155 crypt\ndwarves, Fong Yu led them back to the\nsurface mine. Together with the more\nthan 100 human zombies and pigheaded\nzombies who were waiting for Fong Yu in\na line, the number of people in the mine\nsuddenly reached more than 300. This\nmade the mine, which had seemed quite\nspacious before, suddenly feel cramped.\nIt looks like we need to expand this\nmine. So Fongu shared his thoughts with\nSteve. Steve had no objection to\nexpanding the mine. But he said he\ndidn't want these dwarf zombies to stay\nin the mine. Funu could understand this.\nAfter all, these dwarf demons were also\nthe culprits who killed the ghosts, and\nit would definitely be uncomfortable to\nbe together with them all the time. Funu\nthen promised Steve that he would find a\nplace to put the dwarf zombies as soon\nas possible and then take them away.\nAfter a hunt outside the underground\npalace, and the time spent traveling\nback and forth, the weapons and armor\nmade in the crafting station were all\nfinished. Funu then took them out and\ndistributed them to the human zombies\nand pigheaded zombies. As for the dwarf\nzombies, Olivia had them bring their\nclubs before they came up. As for armor,\nthese dwarfs didn't seem to need it\nsince their height of nearly 3 m meant\nthat ordinary people couldn't attack\ntheir heads and necks. So once\neverything was ready, Fong Yu led the\n300 plus zombie unit out of the mine.\nWhere do we go next? Olivia asked. Upon\nhearing this, Fong Yu pointed to the\neast and said, \"Go to that spider cave\nand settle these zombies there first.\"\nThe reason for settling the walkers in\nthe spider cave is that the spider cave\nis located between Fong Yu's manor and\nKing's Landing, so that no matter which\nside is attacked, Fong Yu can use this\ngroup of walkers immediately. Moreover,\nthe zombies aren't afraid of the\nspider's venom, so they can conveniently\nclean up all the spiders in the spider\ncave, saving them from constantly\nbothering them. Although Fong Yu has\nalready killed the vengeful human-faced\nspider, who knows if there will be other\nvengeful spiders. The wild boores in the\nwestern wild boar forest don't need to\nbe exterminated. They can be treated as\ndomesticated livestock. However, Fongu\nplans to eliminate those vicious\nspiders. Moreover, Fong Yu had observed\nthe spider cave last time. It was not\nonly spacious, but also interconnected.\nPerhaps he could use it as a basis to\nopen up a second mine. On the way,\nOlivia asked Fongu a question. Master,\nshould we give this army a name? Name?\nYes. A large-scale army needs a\nresounding name. Duh. Fongu glanced at\nthe group of more than 300 people, and a\nmovie he had seen before suddenly popped\ninto his mind. How about we call it\nSparta? Sparta? What does that mean?\nOlivia asked curiously. Fong Yu smiled\nslightly and said, \"There was once an\narmy of 300 men who fought desperately\nagainst an enemy 100 times their size.\nThat army was called Sparta.\" Just as\nFong Yu was preparing to lead the zombie\narmy to sweep through the spider cave,\nSong Jimming&lt;unk&gt;s barrage of calls came\nagain. Song Jimming ID 3533. Boss, help.\nSong jamming. ID 3533. The dragon is\nhere. It has already circled King's\nLanding three times. Chapter 142.\nNegotiation with the dragon. As the old\nsaying goes, good fortune never comes in\npairs, but misfortunes never come\nsingly. I just received bad news this\nmorning that the coalition forces of\nDistrict 8 were going to besiege\nDistrict 6. And now I've received news\nthat dragons are attacking King's\nLanding. Left with no other option, Fong\nYu led Olivia and Alpha toward King's\nLanding. As for the Undead Legion, Fong\nYu ordered them to remain stationed in\nplace. After all, the enemy they would\nbe dealing with was a flying dragon, and\naccording to Olivia, the dragon was a\nfire dragon. These zombies, lacking\nranged firepower, would be useless\nexcept as easy prey. Soon, Fongu sped\nall the way to the outskirts of\nKing&lt;unk&gt;s Landing. In the distance, he\nsaw a giant dragon with a fiery red body\ncircling above King's Landing, spewing a\nstring of scorching dragon flames down\nat the city below. At the same time,\nscreams and shouts echoed throughout\nKing&lt;unk&gt;s Landing, and thick smoke rose\nfrom the city. It was unknown how many\npeople had died under the dragon's\nflames. Seeing this, Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s eyes\nwidened in fury. Without saying a word,\nhe pulled out his horn bow and prepared\nto shoot. But Olivia stopped him.\nMaster, at this distance, even with your\ndivine arrow drawing technique, it will\nbe difficult to hit it. And even if you\ndid hit it, you wouldn't be able to\npenetrate its scales. Let me do it.\nOlivia said you sent you. Fanu put down\nhis bow and arrow, glanced at the iron\naxe in Olivia's hand, and asked\ndoubtfully. You think you can hit it?\nNo. Olivia shook her head, but I\nrecognize it. With that, Olivia dashed\nforward and shouted at the dragon in the\nsky. Odum, cease your attack. Upon\nhearing someone call its name, the\ndragon in the sky stopped spewing dragon\non fire, turned its head to look at the\nfigure calling it from the open ground\noutside the city, then turned its wings\nto adjust its direction, and descended\ntoward that figure. Boom! With a loud\ncrash, the dragon landed in front of\nOlivia, its massive claws denting the\nground. At this moment, Fong Yu,\nstanding to the side and comparing it\nwith other objects, realized that this\ngiant dragon was at least 15 m tall. Its\nwingspan reached an astonishing 20 m.\nIts crimson scales shimmerred with fiery\nlight from time to time. Seeing this,\nFongu was secretly shocked. No wonder a\ngiant dragon could destroy a city. In\nthe era of cold weapons, such a creature\nwas probably a symbol of invincibility.\nInsect, do you know me? The dragon Odum\nlowered its massive head and stared at\nOlivia on the ground, speaking in human\nlanguage. Olivia reached up and pulled\noff the bandage on her face, saying\ncoldly, \"It's me.\" Upon seeing Olivia's\nface, the dragon abruptly raised its\nhead, took a step back, and said in a\nsomewhat surprised tone, \"Oh, it's you,\nthe overlord. You actually came out of\nthe sealed land.\" Olivia nodded and\nsaid, \"It's been a year since I came\nout.\" The dragon remained silent for a\nmoment upon hearing this, then asked,\n\"So, Lord, what brings you here?\" Olivia\npointed to King&lt;unk&gt;s Landing beside her\nand said, \"This is my master's city.\"\nMaster Odum tilted his head, suddenly\nrealizing, \"No wonder you were able to\ncome out of the sealed land. So, the\ndark god has chosen a new\nrepresentative.\" Olivia nodded and said,\n\"Therefore, you are not allowed to\nattack this city or its inhabitants\nagain.\" The dragon remained silent for a\nlong time before finally speaking. \"My\nagreement with you was only that we\nwould not enter that dark forest, but\nthere was no other agreement.\" Upon\nhearing this, Olivia frowned and said\ncoldly, \"So, you want to be our enemy?\nHave you considered the consequences?\"\n\"Consequences?\" \"Heah.\" The dragon let\nout a low laugh, mocking. \"Ryan, have\nyou forgotten that you have lost your\nformer strength? So, your threat is\nutterly laughable to me.\" After saying\nthat, the dragon flapped its huge wings,\nand a strong wind suddenly arose with\nintense wind pressure sweeping towards\nOlivia. Seeing this, Olivia shouted and\nher body flashed with dark green light\nwhich countered the oncoming gale. At\nthe same time, she gripped the iron ax\nin her hand, ready to fight the dragon\nto the death. Just then, a voice broke\nthe tense atmosphere. \"Hey, don't be\nnervous, my friend,\" Fongu shouted as he\nslowly walked towards the two people\nfacing off. \"Since we're all\nacquaintances, there's no need to make a\nbig fuss over such a small\nmisunderstanding, right?\" Olivia turned\nto look at Fong Yu, a hint of worry\nflashing in her eyes. With Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s\ncurrent strength, the dragon only needed\none breath of dragon fire to turn him\ninto charred bones. At this moment, the\ndragon turned its head to look at Fong\nYu, who was walking towards it and asked\ncontemptuously, \"And who are you?\" Fongu\nbowed slightly to the dragon and said\nwith a smile, \"I am not talented, but I\nam Ryan&lt;unk&gt;s master. In your words, I\nam the spokesperson chosen by the dark\ngod. Upon hearing this, a hint of\nsurprise flashed in the dragon's eyes.\nIt lowered its head and carefully\nexamined the human before its gaze\nturned contemptuous once more. O, how\ncould such a weak and ordinary human\nbecome the spokesperson for the god of\ndarkness? It seems the god of darkness\nreally misjudged him. Upon hearing this,\nFong Yu replied with an unddeinished\nsmile. I don't know if the dark god has\nmisjudged me, but my identity as his\nrepresentative should still be genuine.\nSo, your excellency, the dragon, could\nyou please refrain from attacking my\ncity for the sake of the dark god? The\ndragon fell silent just as the human had\nsaid. It could humiliate the weakened\nundead overlord and even look down on\nthe dark god's representative, but it\ndared not disrespect the dark god. After\nall, he was also a god. After a moment,\nthe dragon shook its massive head,\nlowered it, and said to Fongu, \"Human,\nhow dare you, so weak, speak so loudly\nbefore me, Odum, I admire your courage,\nand for that reason, I forgive your\noffense. I will cease attacking your\ncity. But the dragon abruptly changed\nthe subject, saying, \"However, I am very\nhungry. If you want me to give up all\nthe delicious food in the city, you need\nto offer me a satisfactory deal in\nexchange.\"\nI knew this guy would try to negotiate,\nFongu sneered inwardly, but outwardly\nreplied respectfully. \"If you just want\nfood, that's easy to solve. How about\nthis? Within 2 days, I will prepare 100\nwild boores and personally deliver them\nto your dragon's lair. Not only that,\nbut every 6 days thereafter, I will send\nyou 100 wild boores. What do you think?\nThe dragon nodded in satisfaction. It\nhad never wanted to break ties with this\nrepresentative of the dark god. And\nsince the other party had given it a way\nout and offered such generous terms, it\nhad no reason to refuse. So it said\nrepresentative of darkness. I am very\nsatisfied with your attitude. I'm\nstarting to like you a little. What's\nyour name? My name is Fong Yu. Very\nwell, Fong Yu. You have gained my\nfriendship. The dragon lowered its head\nand stared at Fong Yu with its huge\ndragon eyes, saying, \"But I hope you\nwill not break your promise. Don't\nworry. I'm a man of my word.\" Fong Yu\nforced a smile and nodded slightly,\nenduring the foul stench emanating from\nthe dragon's mouth. In that case,\nlet's&lt;unk&gt; meet again in two days. After\nthe dragon finished speaking, it spread\nits wings and flapped them forcefully,\nrising into the sky and flying towards\nthe horizon. Watching the dragon depart,\nFong Yu breathed a sigh of relief, and\nthe smile on his face slowly faded.\nMaster Olivia looked at Fong Yu and said\nwith great shame, \"I'm sorry. I was too\nweak and caused you trouble.\" Fongu\nwaved his hand to interrupt Olivia's\nself-lame and shook his head, saying,\n\"It's not your fault. You did very well.\nAfter all, it was a dragon.\" So Olivia\nasked, \"Are you really going to gather\n100 wild boores in 2 days and send them\nto that dragon?\" Fong Yu nodded and\nsaid, \"Of course, I'll give it to it.\nBut if it dares to eat it, I'm willing\nto take its life.\" Fongu is not someone\nwho likes to cause trouble, but if\nanyone dares to mess with him, he will\ndefinitely make them pay, even if the\nother party is a seemingly powerful\ndragon. The flames in King's Landing\nwere still burning. Fongu could still\nfaintly hear screams, cries, and calls\nfor help coming from the city. These\nwere the players who had come to build\nKing's Landing at his call. They were\npeople who trusted and supported him,\nand he had put a lot of effort into\nbuilding this town. Why would such a\nferocious beast as a dragon suddenly\nappear? Fa was puzzled. Isn't my\ndistrict number six ranked first and has\na mythical beast descending upon it? Why\ndid the ferocious beasts come? At this\nmoment, the game assistant seemed to\nsense his confusion and sent him a\nmessage. This giant dragon was not a\nferocious beast that appeared as a\nsystem punishment. It originally resided\nin district 6. Fongu took a deep breath.\nThis was arguably the biggest loss he\nhad suffered since entering the game.\nFongu glanced once more at the receding\ndragon on the horizon, then gritted his\nteeth and said, \"I'll get my revenge\nsooner or later.\" After saying that, he\nturned and rushed into the city,\nchanting a water spell. The dragon's\ndrag on fire is similar to fire magic.\nIt adheres to objects and burns\ncontinuously. It is difficult to\nextinguish this dragon fire with\nordinary water. The town's people who\ndesperately tried to fetch water to put\nout the fire had little effect and could\nonly watch as the dragon fire slowly\nengulfed their newly built houses. Just\nthen, a tall water elemental servant\nwhose entire body was formed from\ncondensed blue green water appeared in\nfront of the house engulfed by dragon\nflames and sprayed streams of blue water\nat the burning flames. Soon the dragon\nflames gradually died out under the\nimpact of the water elemental water\nguns. This is an intermediate level\nwater magic spell summon water elemental\nservant. The caster can condense the\nsurrounding water flow into a water\nelemental servant with a physical form\nof about 3 m which can last for 10\nminutes. Each water elemental summoned\nconsumes 50 mana points. Although the\nattack power of the water elemental\nservant is not as strong as the\nintermediate level fire magic fire\ndragon spell, it can be more useful than\nfire dragon spell in many situations. In\nsituations like this one where\nfirefighting is needed, the water guns\nfired by the water elemental servants\ncontain magical energy that can quickly\nextinguish dragon flames that ordinary\nwater cannot extinguish. At this moment,\nFong Yu had exhausted all his magic\npower and summoned six water elemental\nservants to fight the fires throughout\nthe city. The effect was obvious, and\nthe spreading fires were quickly brought\nunder control. \"Holy crap, who is this\nguy? He's so powerful,\" one player\nexclaimed. \"That looks like a mid-level\nwater elemental servant, right? Our\nserver already has a mid-level mage.\"\nUpon hearing this, another player nearby\nexclaimed, \"You don't even recognize\nhim? How dare you come to King's\nLanding? He's Fun Yu, the big boss. He's\nthe one who conquered this city. He's\nthe number one in combat power and\nwealth in our region. A true super boss.\nTwo female players who were bandaging\nthe wounded looked at Fong Yu, who was\ndirecting his water elemental minions to\nput out the fire with admiration and\nsaid, \"Fong Yu is so handsome. I feel so\nsafe and secure if I were his\ngirlfriend.\" At this moment, a male\nplayer who had just come down from the\ncity wall interjected. \"You guys didn't\nsee the scene just now where boss Fun Yu\nconfronted the dragon.\" \"That was truly\nawesome, huh? What's going on? Tell me\nquickly.\" The female player asked\nexcitedly. The wounded soldier whose\nbandages were being applied by her\nimmediately screamed in pain. \"Ouch! Be\ngentle. Be gentle. I'm going to die. I'm\ngoing to die. Oh, I'm so sorry. I'm so\nsorry. The female player apologized\nrepeatedly. Immediately, the male player\nwho came down from the city wall began\nto vividly describe how Fongu bravely\nand fearlessly negotiated with the\ndragon, intimidated the dragon with his\ndoineering aura, and made the dragon run\naway with its tail between its legs. I\ndon't quite believe it, a player who was\nlistening nearby muttered. Upon hearing\nthis, the male player who was telling\nthe story immediately declared with\nabsolute certainty. Everything I said is\nthe truth. If you don't believe me, you\ncan ask the other players who came down\nfrom the city wall. They all saw it with\ntheir own eyes. Upon hearing this, the\nother players who had just come down\nfrom the city wall nodded in agreement.\nYes, we saw it with our own eyes. And I\nwas stunned. Absolutely, Boss Fong. You\nsimply said a few words to that dragon\nand it flew away in fright. Yes, yes,\nyes, I can testify, too. Uh, I suddenly\nrealized that coming to King's Landing\nto seek refuge with boss Fong Yu was an\nextremely wise decision. That's right. I\nthink so, too. Me, too. From now on,\nFongu will be my idol. Thus, rumors\nbegan to spread throughout King's\nLanding that Fongu had single-handedly\nfrightened away a giant dragon with his\ndoineering aura. From then on, players\nin King's Landing would speak of Fong Yu\nwith a sense of awe. Of course, Fong Yu,\nas the protagonist, was completely\nunaware of this. He was still diligently\ndirecting the water elementals to\nextinguish the dragon flames. 10 minutes\nlater, when the water elemental servants\ndisappeared, the flames in the city were\nmostly extinguished. A moment later,\nSong Jimming also rushed to Fong\nYu&lt;unk&gt;s side, looking distressed as he\ntallied up the losses. The death toll is\naround 30 with over 180 injured and more\nthan a dozen missing. Song Jimming said\nto Fong Yu, his eyes red- rimmed.\nBrother Fong, if you had arrived any\nlater, we might have been massacred.\nAfter listening to Song Jimming&lt;unk&gt;s\nreport, Fong Yu frowned and asked, \"The\ndragon hunter ballista is useless.\" \"Of\ncourse, we used it.\" Song Jimming\nexplained, \"The dragon was initially\nafraid to come down because it saw our\ndragon hunting crossbow, so it kept\ncircling in the sky. Later, our people\ntried to shoot it a few times with the\ndragon hunting crossbow, but it dodged\nthem all. Probably because it was not\nfamiliar with the crossbow.\" This was\nsomething Fong you hadn't expected.\nIndeed, although the Dragon Slayer\nballista had the ability to hunt dragons\nwithout an experienced operator, its hit\nrate would be pitifully low, rendering\nit useless. It's like giving a gun to a\nchild who doesn't know how to use it. At\nfirst glance, it may seem very\nintimidating, but once it's discovered\nthat the child doesn't know how to use\nit, the gun becomes useless. But it's\nthanks to that dragon hunting ballista\nthat we had some time, otherwise the\nlosses would probably have been much\nmore severe. Song Jimming remarked. He\nthen asked Fong Yu curiously. By the\nway, brother Fong, I just saw the dragon\nland outside the city and then it flew\naway a little while later. Did you drive\nit away? Fong Yu shook his head and\nsaid, \"Do I look like someone who has\nthe ability to drive away a dragon? Then\nwhy did that giant dragon leave? I just\nmade a deal with it. Holy crap.\nNegotiating with a dragon, brother Fong,\nhow did you do that?\" Song Jimming\nexclaimed. By the way, why would it be\nwilling to negotiate with you? Fong Yu\nsighed, glanced at Olivia beside him,\nand said, \"Don't ask me that because I\ndon't know the specifics either, and I'd\nlike to know, too.\" Oh, okay. So, what\nwere the terms you negotiated with that\ndragon? 2 days later, send 100 wild\nboores to its dragon lair. H song\nJimming gasped. 100 wild boores. I could\nhave the people in the city search for\nsome wild boar herds in the surrounding\narea over the next couple of days and\nhunt them down. But the problem is\nyou're personally delivering them to the\ndragon's lair. That's far too dangerous.\nDanger, huh? Fongu sneered. I'll let it\nknow that provoking me is the greatest\ndanger to it. Chapter 143. The war\nbegins. After the fire in the city was\nbrought under control, Fong Yu had Song\nJimming take him to the city lord's\nmansion in the center of the town to\ndiscuss the follow-up arrangements.\nAlthough it was called a discussion, it\nwas actually mainly Song Jaming and\nseveral other deputy city lords\nreporting to each other. The first to\nspeak was Lee Shinlong, one of the\ndeputy city lords and concurrently the\ncity defense commander. He said with the\nashamed expression, \"I'm sorry to\ndisappoint everyone. My earth dragon hid\nin a corner after seeing the giant\ndragon and dared not come out. My dragon\nhunting ballista also failed to hit the\ngiant dragon, which is why the giant\ndragon caused such great damage to the\ntown. As the city's defense commander,\n\"This is my dereliction of duty.\" Fongu\nwaved his hand and said, \"Dragons have a\nbloodline suppression over dragons,\nwhich is common knowledge. You can't be\nblamed for this.\" As for the dragon\nhunting ballista, the incident happens\nsuddenly and you are probably unfamiliar\nwith its operation, which is\nunderstandable. I suggest that in\naddition to you, another 5 to 10 towns\npeople be specially trained to operate\nthe dragon hunting ballista and get them\nfamiliar with its operation as soon as\npossible. Lie Chunlong nodded and sat\ndown with a heavy expression.\nImmediately afterwards, Lu X Yaoang, who\nwas in charge of urban construction,\nbegan to give a report. Currently, aside\nfrom the 32 deaths and 19 missing\npersons caused by the dragon attack,\nKing's Landing has a population of 3,556\nand 1,235\nhabitable houses. However, 35 houses\nwere severely damaged by drag on fire\nand need to be rebuilt, while 79 houses\nwere slightly damaged and can be\nrepaired. Because we have just survived\nthe winter, the city's food reserves are\nonly enough for the entire population\nfor 2 days. Therefore, our immediate\npriority is to send people out to find\nfood as soon as possible. But this will\nmean that we will not have enough\nmaterials for city defense construction.\nSo, we will have to temporarily halt\nthat. At this point, Lu X Yaoang paused,\nlooked at Fong Yu with some hesitation,\nand said, \"But this morning, City Lord\nSong told us that the other eight\ndistricts are forming a coalition to\ndeal with us. Therefore, the\nconstruction of city defenses is equally\nimportant and cannot be stopped. So,\nwhat to do is up to you, boss. Fongu\nnodded, thought for a moment, and\nreplied, \"We can postpone the\nconstruction of city defense materials\nfor now. I'll figure something out. You\nshould prioritize gathering food,\nespecially have the players hunt the\nnearby wild boar herds. Also, go and\narrange for people to make 300 iron\npickaxes immediately. Bring the pickaxes\nto me in 1 hour.\" When Lu X Yao Fang\nheard that Fong Yu actually wanted 300\niron pickaxes, she was a little\nsurprised, but she didn't say anything\nand got up to leave the table to make\nthe arrangements. Immediately\nafterwards, Song Jimming began to report\non the situation in the entire district.\nCurrently, including players who have\ntransferred from other servers, our\nregion has a total of 7,085\nplayers. Of these, 5,998\nare from our own region and 1,087 are\nfrom other regions. I still have nearly\n500 transfer applications that I haven't\nhad time to approve yet. Song Jaming was\nquite happy when he mentioned this data.\nAfter all, the number of players is the\nfoundation of a region strength. He\ncontinued, this is only the number of\ntransfer applications for the first day.\nIn the next few days, our number should\ngradually return to 10,000. Fong nodded\nand said, \"The key is to strengthen the\nscreening of players transferring from\nother regions. Also, see if you can find\na new suitable settlement so that those\nplayers can gather there first and not\ncome to King's Landing. After all,\neveryone knows that there are definitely\nspies from other regions among those who\ntransfer.\" Song Jimming nodded in\nresponse. \"I'm already making\narrangements for that. There's a river\nvalley about 2 km from here. It used to\nbe the settlement of the women's\nfederation. Now that the members of the\nwomen's federation have moved into the\ncity, I plan to redevelop that\nsettlement into a residential area for\nthe relocated people. Then Song Jimming\nadded, \"Also about that bald guy from\nDistrict 7 that you asked me to keep an\neye on last time. Brother Fong, I've\nalso learned some information about\nDistrict 7 through him. Would you like\nto hear it? Go ahead and tell me.\nCurrently, District 7 is mainly divided\ninto four factions. The largest faction\nis the settlement dominated by Japanese\nplayers whose leader is Tojo Miroida,\nwho is also the current Lord of District\n7. The second largest faction is the\nsettlement formed by players from\nseveral countries in the South China\nSea. The third largest faction is the\nsettlement established by players from\nthe Korean Federation. The last faction\nis a joint team of several major drug\nlords in the silver triangle. Fong Yu\nwas slightly pleased after hearing this\nand said, \"So, District 7 isn't a\nmonolithic entity? Hey, as far as I\nknow, none of the 10 districts are\nmonolithic. They're basically divided\ninto several factions. Our district is\nconsidered good. Apart from us being\npeaceful and unassuming, the other\nsmaller factions are almost negligible.\"\nFongu pondered for a moment and said,\n\"In that case, try to arrange it and see\nif any of the three smaller forces in\ndistrict 7 are willing to form an\nalliance with us.\" \"Understood.\" Song\nJimming nodded and said, \"I'll arrange\nthis after the meeting. By the way,\nwhat's the situation with Viking Emperor\nin District 8?\" Fong Yu asked again.\nJust as Song Jiming was about to answer\nFong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s question, he suddenly\nfroze. After staring at the air in front\nof him for a moment, his expression\nchanged drastically. \"Oh no, Viking\nEmperor just sent a message. Their\ndistrict 8 is being besieged by players\nfrom other districts.\" \"District 8? A\nsiege?\" Fongu frowned. \"Didn't they say\nthey were going to besiege our district\n6?\" \"I don't know either,\" Seeming said,\nlooking completely bewildered. The\nViking Emperor just sent a message that\nthousands of players have suddenly\nappeared on the border between districts\n8 and 9. Judging by the numbers, they\nare most likely a coalition of districts\n1, 2, 9, and 10. And their target is the\nViking Emperor's settlement. It's not\njust District 9. District 7 seems to\nhave sent a lot of players to attack\nDistrict 8 as well. The Viking King just\nsent a message asking for our help.\nBoss, what should we do? After a moment\nof silence, Fong Yu glanced at everyone\npresent and said, \"I think everyone\nknows the principle of if the lips are\ngone, the teeth will be cold. If\nDistrict 8 is besieged and wiped out,\nthen the next target of those allied\nforces will inevitably be us who are\nisolated and helpless.\" Upon hearing\nthis, Lie Chunlong was the first to\nstand up and say, \"Understood. I'll go\norganize the troops right now and rush\nto the aid of District 8. Wait. Fong Yu\nwaved his hand and called back the\nimpulsive Leech Chin Long, saying, \"I\nbelieve that with Viking Emperor's\nabilities, holding off the enemies in\ndistricts 1, 2, 9, and 10 shouldn't be a\nproblem for now. We just need to help\nthem deal with the enemies in district\n7. Leave that to me.\" After saying that,\nFongu looked at Lie Chun Long seriously\nand said, \"You should immediately\norganize people to scout the border\nbetween district 5 and our district. If\nthose eight districts have really joined\nforces, then the enemies in districts\nthree, four, and five will definitely\ntake this opportunity to launch a sneak\nattack on us. At the very least, they\nwill secretly use our territory to\nattack district 8. Lie Chun Long\nsuddenly realized, slapped his forehead,\nand said, \"You're right. I'll go\norganize the manpower right now.\"\nWatching Lie Chun&lt;unk&gt;s departing\nfigure, Fong Yu sighed helplessly. This\nguy was all right and his combat\nstrength was decent, but he seemed a bit\ndim-witted. He wondered if Lie Chun Long\nhad used all six attribute points he\nreceived from the two system rewards on\nstrength or agility. After the brief\nmeeting, Fong Yu along with Olivia and\nAlpha headed towards the spider forest.\nHe planned to lead the newly formed\nundead army to sweep through District 7\nand force the personnel from District 7\nwho were attacking District 8 to\nretreat. As for whether or not to go to\ndistrict 8 to provide reinforcements,\nthat will depend on the situation. If\nthe enemy in district 7 is easily\ndefeated, then it would be appropriate\nto go to district 8 to lend a hand.\nHowever, if they encounter strong\nresistance in district 7, then Fong Yu\ncan only pray that the Viking Emperor\nwill have good fortune. Chapter 144\nattack on Hango. Soon, Fong Yu and his\ntwo companions arrived at the spider\nforest. After gathering the zombie army\nstationed there, they headed non-stop\ntoward the border of district 7. Fonu\nglanced at the map. The spider forest\nwhere he was located was in the center\nof district 6, about 10 km away from the\nborder of districts 6 and 7. If he\nmarched at full speed, he could get\nthere in about half an hour.\nFortunately, his strength and agility\nwere almost at 10, which was the peak\nlevel of a normal human. So, running 10\nkm was not a problem. The undead zombies\nwere also tireless, not to mention Alpha\nand Olivia, so the whole team was still\nvery fast. At the 25th minute, they\nreached the boundary of zones 6 and 7,\nwhich was a dense forest. Fongu waved\nhis hand to halt the army's advance,\npanting heavily as he said, \"Alpha,\nOlivia, could you two go and scout out\nthe situation first to see if there are\nany ambushes?\" Alpha and Olivia nodded\nin agreement and then rushed into the\nwoods of District 7. 10 minutes later,\nAlpha and Olivia returned from the woods\nand Fongu noticed fresh blood stains on\nOlivia's iron axe. Is there an ambush?\nOlivia nodded and said, \"A 10-man squad\nwas killed by me and Alpha, a 10person\nteam that should be responsible for\nreconnaissance and intelligence\ngathering. Since the enemy's\nreconnaissance team has been eliminated,\nhis own team is likely exposed. So Fong\nYu only has two choices at the moment.\nEither launch a full-scale assault on\nthe settlement where the Lord of\nDistrict 7 is located and try to take\ndown the enemy's main base before the\nmain force returns from District 8 to\nreinforce. Either withdraw now. Fong Yu\nthen carefully assessed the difference\nin strength between the two sides.\nAccording to intelligence, the total\npopulation of District 7 is around\n2,750.\nDistrict 7 is divided into four\nfactions. Even if the largest Lord\nsettlement has more than half the\npopulation of the district, it would\nonly have around 1,500 people at most.\nIn addition, District 7 has sent a large\nnumber of troops to District 8.\nAccording to the information from the\nViking Emperor, the number of troops\nsent from District 7 to District 8\nshould be more than 1,000. Therefore,\nthe number of troops left to guard the\nLord's settlement in District 7 should\nbe around 500, most of whom are probably\nfemale players. Olivia had also\nestimated the combat strength of her\nzombie army. It should be able to handle\na force of 1,000 men without any\nproblem. Then the choice becomes clear.\ntake advantage of your weakness and kill\nyou. I heard that the Lord's settlement\nin district 7 is called Hano. Fong Yu\nsmiled slightly and said, \"I wonder if\nthere are any cherry blossom trees. If\nthere are, I'll have to carry two back\nand give them to Valentina.\" When Fong\nYu led his army of zombies to Han Ko\nfollowing the map coordinates given by\nthe bald man in District 7, he\ndiscovered it was merely a larger\nvillage, less than a third the size of\nKing's Landing. Although the village is\nsmall, it still has the necessary\ndefensive facilities. A simple wooden\nspiked fence was built around the\nperimeter, and there were even four\nwooden watchtowers in the four corners\nof the village with two archers standing\non each tower looking around. At this\nmoment, the arrow tower closest to Fong\nYu had spotted Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s troops and\nbegan shouting loudly into the village.\nSoon, a dozen female players dressed in\nhemp clothing and carrying wooden spears\nrushed out of the village entrance and\nbegan to protect the players in the\nfarmland outside the village as they\nquickly retreated into the village.\nJudging from the fact that all the\nplayers rushing out of the village are\nfemale, it seems that all the men in the\nvillage have gone to District 8, making\nit virtually effortless for their zombie\narmy to take over the village. So Fong,\nyou said to Olivia, \"You'll be the one\nto fight this battle. Aren't you going\nto participate?\" Olivia asked curiously.\n\"We're&lt;unk&gt; all women. It's not fun\nfighting, and I'm afraid people will\nlaugh at me if they find out.\" Fongu\nshrugged and said, \"You're a woman, so\nyou don't have this problem. Just\nremember one principle. Those who\nsurrender will not be killed. Those who\nare willing to come with us to District\n6 will be treated well. And as for those\nwho would rather die than submit, then\nlet them die. Olivia nodded upon hearing\nthis and then led her army of zombies\ntowards the village called Hanio. As the\nzombie army rushed toward the village,\nthe female soldiers at the village\nentrance quickly retreated back into the\nvillage and unhesitatingly lowered the\ngate full of wooden spikes. Some female\nplayers who had not yet escaped back to\nthe village cried out and came to the\nvillage entrance. wanting the villagers\nto let them in. But the villagers\nremained unmoved. Soon, dozens of female\narchers armed with bows and arrows\nappeared on the village's wooden walls\nand began to fire at the army of zombies\ncharging towards their village. Fong Yu,\nwho was watching from a distance, nodded\nslightly, expressing his approval of the\nseries of responses the village had made\nin such a short time. It seems that the\ncommander in this village does\nunderstand some strategy and tactics.\nFong Yu looked at the female archers on\nthe village wall who were drawing their\nbows, knocking their arrows, and firing\nin unison, and couldn't help but admire\nthem in his heart. If my army were an\nordinary army, it might not be able to\ntake down this village, and it might\neven suffer heavy casualties. At this\nmoment, Olivia, who was commanding the\nzombie army, waved her hand slightly,\nand the crypt dwarf zombies at the front\nstopped advancing. Instead, the Borman\nzombies from the rear came to the front,\nraised their shields, and blocked all\nthe arrows shot from the wall. Even\nthough some arrows hit the dwarf zombies\nin the back, it did not affect their\ncombat power at all. Olivia then waved\nher hand again, and the army of over 300\nzombies arrived at the village entrance,\nbraving the enemy archers fire. At\nOlivia's command, the two tallest cave\ndwarves took the giant shields from the\npigheaded man beside them, roared, and\nbegan to ram the shields against the\nvillage gate. Thump! Thump! With two\nloud crashes, the giant shield\nshattered, but a large section of the\nspikes on the gate was also broken off.\nThen, the two dwarf demons began to ram\nthe heavy wooden door with their massive\nbodies. Upon seeing this, the archers on\nthe wall immediately changed their\nfiring direction and began shooting at\nthe two dwarves at the gate. However,\neven though the backs and shoulders of\nthe two dwarves were filled with arrows,\nit did not slowed down their speed as\nthey crashed into the city gate. The\narchers panicked when they saw this.\nThey didn't understand why these two\nmonsters were still alive after being\nhit by dozens of arrows. Nor did they\nunderstand where these nearly 3 m tall\ngreen-skinned monsters came from. But\nthey knew that once the city gates were\nbreached, death might be all that\nawaited them. Judging from the degree to\nwhich the wooden door was shaking, it\nwouldn't be long before the dwarf demons\nsmashed it open. Once they did, the\nbattle would essentially be over. Just\nthen, Fongu suddenly saw a tall figure\nappear on the wall above the city gate.\nIt was a female warrior wearing a blue\nhayori and with her hair tied in a\nponytail as a resounding sword cry\nechoed across the land. The female\nwarrior held a gleaming katana in her\nhand. Immediately afterwards, Fong Yu\nsaw the female warrior leap down from\nthe wall and accurately stabbed the head\nof one of the dwarf zombies that was\nramming the city gate with her katana.\nJust as Fong Yu raised his eyebrows in\nsurprise, the female warrior had already\nstepped on the head of the dwarf zombie\nand jumped onto the shoulder of another\ndwarf, swinging her sword to slash at\nthe neck of the second dwarf. A sharp\nblade flashed and the head of the second\ndwarf demon flew high into the air while\nthe figure leaped back onto the wall.\n\"Wi ko e!\" Cheers erupted from the\nvillage walls. \"Holy crap!\" Fong Yu\nexclaimed, looking at the dashing figure\nstanding on the wall. Wow, that's\nawesome. Whose subordinate is that? Just\nas Fong Yu was marveling, Olivia also\nnoticed the figure of the female warrior\non the wall. So, she took off the iron\nax from her back and walked into the\ngroup of zombies gathered at the\nentrance of the village. After the two\ndwarf zombies that had rammed the\nvillage gate fell to the ground, new\ndwarfs immediately took their place and\ncontinued to ram the gate. Seeing this,\nthe female warrior on the wall jumped\ndown again, preparing to repeat her\nprevious tactic to kill the two dwarf\nzombies. Just as the female warrior\nplunged her katana into the head of the\ndwarf demon at her feet, a similarly\ntall figure leaped out from the horde of\nzombies, wielding an iron axe and\nslashing straight at the female warrior.\nChapter 145. Self-defense counterattack.\nSeeing the iron axe hurtling towards her\nwith the force of thunder, the female\nwarrior knew she had no time to dodge\nand could only draw her sword to block\nit. With a clang of metal on metal, the\niron axe struck the katana, and the\nfemale warrior was sent flying by\nOlivia's powerful ax, crashing into the\ndoor behind her. In an instant, the\nspikes on the gate pierced through the\nfemale warrior's shoulder and abdomen\nfrom behind, hanging her on the gate. At\nthe same time, Olivia gave the female\nwarrior no chance to catch her breath.\nSeeing that the female warrior was still\nalive, she rushed forward again and\nswung her ax at the female warrior. The\nfemale warrior, impaled by the wooden\nsplinter in the gate, could only watch\nhelplessly as Olivia's iron ax cleaved\ninto her chest. With an incredulous look\nin her eyes, she slowly closed them. A\nfemale warrior who had the potential to\nbecome a great swordsman died tragically\nin the northwest. Upon seeing this, Fong\nYu clicked his tongue, shook his head,\nand sighed. That's why you can't show\noff on the battlefield or you'll die\nvery quickly. Seeing the female warrior\nkilled by Olivia, and in such a tragic\nway, right above the gates of their own\nvillage, the female archers on the\nvillage walls burst into tears. A very\nfew raised their bows and arrows to\nshoot at Olivia. But most of them lost\ntheir will to fight and threw down their\nbows and arrows, fleeing back into the\nvillage. At this point, Olivia was too\nlazy to command the dwarfs to ram the\nvillage gate anymore. After killing the\nfemale warrior, she casually used her\niron ax to cut the vines binding the\ngate, and the wooden gate quickly\ncrumbled because it was no longer\nsecured by the vines. Immediately,\nOlivia directed the dwarves to give a\ngentle push, and the village gate\ncollapsed with a crash. After the city\ngates were breached, the zombies stormed\nin, ending the brief siege. What\nfollowed was a one-sided pursuit and\nslaughter. Because there were no\nchildren under 16 or elderly people over\n70 participating in the game, and he had\ntold Olivia beforehand that those who\nsurrendered would not be killed, Fongu\ncould still accept this kind of\nmassacre. 5 minutes later, the shouts in\nthe village gradually subsided. Fong Yu\nknew that the final battle inside was\nalso coming to an end. So, he patted\nAlfa's head and said, \"Let's go in and\nsee how many pretty girls we can capture\nthis time.\" When Fong Yu entered the\nbesieged Hono, he saw that the zombies\nhad gathered the remaining surviving\nwomen in an open area and surrounded\nthem. Olivia walked up to Fong Yu and\nsaid, \"There were a total of 475 people\nin the city. 13 escaped, 212 were\nkilled, and there are still 250\nsurvivors here. Fongu nodded and\ninstructed Olivia, \"Go and revive the\ndead bodies first. Leave this to me.\"\nOlivia nodded and turned to leave.\nImmediately, Fong Yu approached the\nwomen surrounded by the zombies and\nsaid, \"Those who want to live, apply to\ntransfer to District 6 now, and I will\ngive you a chance to live in peace.\nAfter you've applied, step forward. I\nwon't harm her because the game system\ntranslates the conversations between\nplayers in real time. Funu doesn't need\nto worry about these Japanese people not\nunderstanding him. Upon hearing this,\nmany of the women crouching in the\nencirclement were tempted and wanted to\nstart applying to transfer to another\ndistrict. But at that moment, a girl who\nlooked young and was wearing a high\nschool uniform stood up from the crowd,\nglaring at Fong Yu with hatred and\ncursing. Despicable intruder, you\nattacked us while our men were away.\nWhat kind of guy is he who only bullies\nwomen? Despicable, Fong Yu said calmly.\nCompared to the evil deeds your\npredecessors committed on Chinese soil,\nwhat I have is far inferior. You're\ntalking nonsense. We've never invaded\nyour country. The high school girl\nretorted sharply. Fong Yu sneered. Huh?\nI know that your history books keep\nsilent about that period of history and\neven maliciously distort the facts of\nyour invasion of China. So, you don't\nknow how many of my compatriots your\nancestors slaughtered. How many\ncivilians, the elderly, women, and\nchildren were cruy killed by your\nancestors. Compared to the crimes\ncommitted by your ancestors, what I have\nis far from despicable. As for you\ncalling me an invader, huh? Fong you\nsneered and continued. You should know\nvery well why there are only women in\nthis city. It's because your men have\nall gone to invade District 8. And I, as\na strategic ally of District 8, am\nentering your district to wage a\nself-defense counterattack when District\n8 is being invaded. Isn't that\nreasonable? Duh. Fong Yu's series of\nwords stunned the high school girl. Fong\nYu was too lazy to pay attention to her\nanymore and said to the women, \"I'll\nonly give you 3 minutes to think it\nover.\" After 3 minutes, I'm sorry, you\ncan all die. After saying that, Fong Yu\nturned and left. Chapter 146. Inviting\nthe enemy into the trap. 3 minutes.\nBarely the time it takes to smoke a\ncigarette. Fong Yu lit one for himself.\nThe flickering cigarette tip mirroring\nhis current mood. In fact, he could have\navoided wasting so much time talking to\nthese Japanese women. killing them all\nand resurrecting them as zombies would\nhave been the most advantageous option\nfor him at the moment. But he didn't do\nthat because he still had a bottom line\nas a human being or rather a moral\nbottom line. So he gave these women a\nchoice. Let them choose to live or die.\nFunu harbors such hatred towards the\nJapanese because he is from in city and\nhis ancestors were among the few\nsurvivors of that massacre. The number\nof people who died was only 300,000 and\nthat was just the number recorded. The\nJapanese invaders did not give them a\nchoice back then. Therefore, Fongu has\nalready done everything he could to be\nkind and righteous. When Fong Yu\ncigarette was reduced to just cigarette\nbutts, he returned to the women and\nasked, \"State your choice.\" An older\nwoman stood up from the crowd, looked at\nFong Yu, and asked, \"If we are willing\nto transfer to District 6, can you\nguarantee us a normal life and not treat\nus like slaves?\" Upon hearing this,\nFongu smiled and said, \"There is no such\nthing as slavery in District 6. As long\nas you do not do anything to harm the\ninterests of District 6 after you\ntransfer to the district, you can enjoy\nthe same equal rights that everyone in\ndistrict 6 can enjoy. Are you the lord\nof district 6? I'm not. Fongu shook his\nhead. Then what makes you guarantee\nthat? The middle-aged woman frowned.\nFongu laughed and said, \"Although I am\nnot a lord, lords have to listen to me.\nHow can I trust you?\" The middle-aged\nwoman questioned. \"You can choose not to\nbelieve. The power of choice is in your\nown hands,\" Fongu said calmly. The\nmiddle-aged woman was silent for a\nmoment. After glancing around at the\nwomen around her, she looked at Fong Yu\nand said, \"I hope you're not lying to\nus.\" Immediately, under the leadership\nof this middle-aged woman, all the\nsurviving women began to submit transfer\napplications to Song Jaming. After\nreceiving feedback from Song Jaming and\nconfirming that all 250 women present\nhad submitted transfer applications,\nFong Yu smiled slightly and said, \"Very\ngood. In the future, you will find out\nhow wise your choices are now. But\nthere's one thing I need to remind you\nof. From now on, you are not allowed to\nhave any contact with anyone in District\n7. If I find out that anyone has tipped\nyou off, I will kill you all, leaving no\none alive. Believe me, I mean what I\nsay. Funu then gave the women 5 minutes\nto pack their luggage and belongings\nwith only one requirement. Take\neverything they could carry and move,\nleaving nothing behind. Just as Fong Yu\nwas waiting for the women to pack up\ntheir supplies, Olivia, who was standing\non the wall, sent a signal. Seeing this,\nFong Yu used a dance of the wind to leap\nonto the wall. Their reinforcements are\nback. Olivia pointed to the edge of the\nwoods in the distance where a steady\nstream of figures were running out of\nthe trees and heading towards the\nvillage. Very good. Fongu smiled\nslightly. The reason he did not retreat\nquickly was that he wanted to wait for\nthe troops from District 7 to return and\nreinforce and then occupy the\nadvantageous terrain of the village to\nlaunch a surprise attack on them. At\nthis moment, the village's broken gate\nhad been put back up by several dwarf\nzombies and more than a dozen female\narchers resurrected by Olivia were\nstanding on the wall. Even the female\nwarrior had been resurrected by Olivia\nand was standing on the wall. Therefore,\nin the eyes of those who returned to\nreinforce District 7, the village did\nnot seem to have been breached. Apart\nfrom the damaged gate, everything was as\nit had been. Soon, the vanguard of the\nreinforcements arrived at the village\ngate. They seemed unaware of the\nsituation inside the village, which\nindicated that the women in the village\nhad not informed them. Sonata, you\nidiot. Why didn't you open the gate when\nyou saw us return? The leader, a man\ndressed in samurai attire, looked up at\nthe female samurai on the wall and\nshouted, \"You told me that Han Ko was\nattacked by enemies. Where are those\ninvaders? Are you playing me for a\nfool?\" The female warrior could not\npossibly answer the question because she\nwas now just a walking corpse. To\nprevent those outside from seeing the\ntorn clothes and blood stains on her\nchest, Olivia had adjusted her posture\nso that her back was to those outside.\nThe samurai outside the door, seeing\nthat Sonata Sauri didn't answer him and\neven turned her back to him without\nlooking at him, immediately flew into a\nrage. He drew his katana and roared.\nInsolent woman, if you don't open the\ndoor, once I get into the city, I'll\nshow you what male superiority truly\nmeans. After seeing that most of the\nreturning players from District 7 were\nalready within range of their bows and\narrows, Fun Yu, who was hiding behind\nthe fence, turned to Olivia and asked,\n\"How accurate are these zombies with\ntheir arrows? I just converted, so I\ndon't have much of a aim yet. But with\nso many people down there, I should be\nable to hit some even if I just shoot\nrandomly,\" Olivia replied. Sigh. Never\nmind. Fongu waved his hand and said,\n\"Anyway, we're not going to rely on\nthese archers to kill them. The\nimportant thing is to lure them into the\nvillage. Let those archers fire their\narrows.\" Olivia then looked at the\narcher zombies standing behind the wall.\nAnd those zombies began to draw their\nbows and shoot at the returning players\noutside the village gate. Just as Olivia\nhad said, their aim was poor and they\nonly hit one or two people. However,\nthis action successfully provoked the\nanger of the reinforcements from\ndistrict 7 outside. The leading male\nwarrior roared and pointed his sword at\nthe village gate, shouting, \"Damn women,\nhow dare you rebel. Everyone, follow me\nand attack.\" He then raised his katana\nand led the charge towards the wooden\ngate of the village. Seeing this, Fongu\nsmiled slightly. He knew the fish had\ntaken the bait. When the fastest group\nof enemies rushed to the tall wooden\ndoor, Fongu had the dwarf demon zombies\nholding the door hide on both sides of\nthe wall to make it easier for the\nenemies outside to come in. Upon seeing\nthe wooden door collapse, the male\nplayers from zone 7 roared and charged\ninto the village. But as soon as they\nentered, they saw a group of tall\nbore-headed zombies wearing iron chain\nmail helmets and wielding giant shields,\nas well as human zombies wielding iron\nswords and knives emerging from behind\nthe houses on both sides. There were\neven some female zombie players from the\nvillage who looked at them coldly with\nwooden spears. At this moment, the dwarf\nzombies hiding on both sides of the wall\nalso came together, holding their clubs,\nblocking the way out of the village.\nSeeing this scene, Fong Yu standing on\nthe wall curled the corners of his mouth\nslightly and gave a wicked smile. Pulled\nhim into the trap. Perfect. With that,\nFong Yu said to Olivia beside him,\n\"Let's begin.\" Olivia nodded. The next\nsecond, the pigheaded man wielding a\ngiant shield charged at the players who\nhad stormed into the village while the\nother zombies also raised their weapons\nand rushed toward the surrounded\nenemies. Thus, a new battle began.\nChapter 147 murder must be accompanied\nby arson. Only then is it complete.\nCompared to the silent, orderly army of\nzombies, the players in district 7 who\nwere surrounded were in a completely\ndifferent state. Most of them were\nalready terrified when they saw the 2 m\ntall pigheaded men charging at them with\ngiant shields. When they turned around\nand saw the 3 m tall dwarf zombies\nhiding behind the wall, they were\nutterly terrified. They had thought they\nwould only be facing some rebellious\nwomen. But who knew that they would see\nso many inhuman monsters as soon as they\nentered the gate? And such tall and\nmighty monsters at that. In an instant,\nthe players in zone 7 were thrown into\nchaos, completely losing their will to\nfight. Some frantically searched for\ntheir lives, while others turned pale\nand stood frozen in fear. Only a small\nnumber of people retained their fighting\nspirit and prepared to fight the zombies\nto the death. However, how could this\ngroup, which had lost its ability to\nfight in unison, possibly be a match for\nthe undead who were fighting in unison?\nThe first wave of the more than 50 giant\nshield pigheaded men charged like\nbulldozers, crushing and killing a large\nnumber of players from District 7. They\nbroke through their formation and left a\nbloody path, leaving corpses all over\nthe ground. And those players in zone 7\nwere no match for the human zombies.\nAlthough the human zombies fighting\nmovements were slower than those of the\nliving, giving the players in District 7\nthe opportunity to use their swords,\nthose swords did not have a killing\neffect on them. Even with arms cut off\nor chests and abdomen pierced, the\nzombies could still calmly use their\nweapons to injure or stab the players in\nfront of them. Under this life forlife\nfighting style, players in zone 7\nquickly fell like harvested leaks, one\nafter another. As for those giant-like\ndwarf mobs, they are the enemy's\nnightmare. With each sweep of their 2 m\nlong clubs, two to three enemies are\nsent flying, and all of them suffer\nbroken bones and broken knives. Those\nenemies who were hit head-on by the club\nfared even worse. Their brains\nsplattered out, and their heads were\nsmashed into their chests, leaving them\nas gruesome headless corpses. Soon, the\nencirclement of the zombies shrank\nsmaller and smaller, and the battle\nsituation quickly became one-sided, or\nperhaps more accurately described as a\nmassacre. The number of players from\nDistrict 7 who stormed into the village\nthis time was not large, only about 500.\nFunu estimated that the person who\ninformed the Lord of District 7 must\nhave said that he only had 300 people\nattacking the city. So, the lord of\ndistrict 7 sent 500 people to reinforce,\nbut he certainly did not expect that\nthis 300man zombie army was actually\nstrong enough to fight against a regular\narmy of a,000 men. Moreover, after\ncapturing Han Ko, Olivia resurrected\nmore than 200 zombies, bringing the\ntotal number to nearly 600. Coupled with\nhis use of a tactic of luring the enemy\ninto a trap, he almost effortlessly\ncrushed the returning reinforcements. In\nless than 10 minutes, the 500 strong\nreinforcement force was slaughtered by\nFong Yu's zombie army. By this time, the\nwomen who had been collecting supplies\nin the houses had also arrived at the\nedge of the battlefield and witnessed\nthe horrific battle. Many of the women\ncould not bear the bloody scene and\nbegan to vomit. It was only then that\nthey truly realized that Fong Yu had\nactually gone easy on them. Standing on\nthe wall, Fong Yu now truly realized the\nterrifying combat power of this zombie\narmy. In 10 minutes, Olivia wiped out an\nenemy force of similar numbers with\nnegligible losses. What's even more\nterrifying is that if Olivia so desires,\nthose 500 dead enemies could quickly\nbecome her allies. Fong Yu turned to\nlook at Olivia, who was standing to the\nside. Looking at this stern yet loyal\nfemale knight, he asked, \"Did you used\nto have a particularly large undead\nlegion?\" Olivia was slightly taken\naback, turned to look at Fong Yu, and\nasked in confusion, \"How did you know?\"\nFong Yu pointed to the group of zombies\nand said, \"With your abilities combined\nwith the combat power of this army, \"No\nmatter what kind of enemy you attack,\nyour troops will only grow stronger and\neventually forming a legion is\ninevitable.\" In addition, the dragon\noutside King's Landing called you king.\nThat title is probably not something an\nordinary person can obtain, right?\nOlivia paused for a moment, then nodded\nand said, \"Yes, I once assembled an\nundead army of a million men, which was\nvirtually invincible.\" \"Hongu gasped\nupon hearing this.\" \"A million strong\nundead army? That would be more than\nenough to sweep across the entire world,\nwouldn't it?\" But Olivia immediately\nadded, \"But that army was wiped out in\nthe war against the gods.\" \"How did you\nget involved with the gods?\" Funu asked\ncuriously. By the way, what about the\nsealed land that the dragon told you\nabout? Olivia glanced at the zombies and\nwomen in the village and said, \"Let's\ntalk about these issues when we get\nback. That's fine, too.\" Just then, a\nloud shout suddenly came from the\nmountain of corpses surrounded by the\nzombies at the foot of the wall. When\nFong Yu turned his head to look, he saw\nthe small mountain of corpses suddenly\nexplode. Amidst the flying pieces of\ncorpses, a figure radiating red light\nappeared on the mountain of corpses.\nFongu took a closer look at the man's\nface. Although it was covered in blood,\nFongu still recognized him. It was the\nmale warrior who had been standing at\nthe front earlier. He couldn't believe\nthat the man was still alive. At this\nmoment, the male warrior's upper body\narmor was shattered and a huge black\ndragon was tattooed on his exposed chest\nand back. He held a katana that was also\nflashing red light in his hand, and with\na loud shout, he slashed at the\npigheaded zombie closest to him. The\npigheaded zombie instinctively raised\nits massive shield to defend itself, but\nthe red katana sliced it in two as\neasily as cutting a melon, severing one\nof its arms and creating a huge gash in\nits chest and abdomen. In an instant,\nthe pigheaded man's intestines spilled\nout of the opening and splattered on the\nground. At that moment, the male warrior\nonce again swung his katana, slashing at\nthe pig's neck. Bite with a clang of\nmetal and a flash of sparks. The iron\nchain male helmet and neck guard on the\npigheaded man's head were completely\nunable to withstand the blow from the\nkatana. The pigheaded zombie head was\nsevered by this single strike. Seeing\nthis, Fongu raised an eyebrow slightly,\nraised his hand to stop Olivia from\nleaving the field, and smiled slightly.\nLeave him to me. It's rare that I didn't\nget a chance to play in such a big\nbattle. Now, this opportunity has come.\nOlivia nodded slightly upon hearing this\nand said, \"Please be careful.\" So, Fongu\nused the dance of the wind to fly down\nthe wall and into the encirclement of\nthe zombies and shouted at the male\nwarrior who was hacking at another\npigheaded zombie. \"Hey, your opponent is\nme.\" Upon hearing this, the male warrior\nturned to look at Fong Yu and was\nslightly takenback. At this moment,\nFongu was wearing the fearless pig king\nset and holding a 1-meter long black\ngold ancient sword. The male warrior\ncould tell at a glance that he was\ndifferent from the zombies around him.\n\"Who are you?\" the male warrior\ndemanded. Fong Yu slightly twirled the\nblack gold ancient sword in his hand and\nsaid calmly, \"Me? I'm the boss.\" After\nsaying that, Fong Yu brandished the\ncharged fiercely towards the male\nwarrior. A brutal collision. After use,\nit locks onto a target within 30 m and\ndashes towards them. Depending on the\ntarget size, it will knock them away or\nstun them for 1 to 3 seconds. At this\nmoment, Fongu was less than 10 m away\nfrom the male warrior. In the blink of\nan eye, Fong Yu rushed in front of the\nmale warrior, preparing to strike the\nopponent's chest with the bone spike of\nhis elbow. This would not only knock him\naway, but also cause huge damage.\nHowever, the male warrior opposite him\nalso realized Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s intention\nand immediately withdrew his sword to\nblock in front of his chest, aiming the\nblade at Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s elbow that was\nabout to strike. If this blow lands\nsquarely, even if Fong Yu can severely\ninjure the male warrior, his arm will\ninevitably be slashed by this seemingly\nincredibly sharp katana. So Fong Yu\nimmediately withdrew his elbow, raised\nhis hand, and placed the horizontal\nblack gold ancient sword in front of\nhim, the blade pointing directly at the\nmale warrior's chest. The shift from\noffense to defense happened in the blink\nof an eye. By the time the male warrior\nsaw Fong Yu change his move, it was too\nlate to change his own. In desperation,\nhe could only push off the ground with\nboth feet and retreat backward while\nusing the katana in front of his chest\nto parry Fong Yu's thrusting blade.\nAlthough the male warrior successfully\nblocked Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s blade, Fong Yu\nstill slammed his shoulder into the male\nwarrior's chest. Bang! With a dull thud.\nAlthough the male warrior used the\nbackward movement to dissipate most of\nthe impact force, he was still sent\nflying by the savage impact and landed\non the ground 3 meters away. At the same\ntime, Fongu had no intention of giving\nthe other party any chance to catch his\nbreath and once again charged towards\nthe fallen male warrior with the black\ngold ancient sword. Upon seeing this,\nthe male warrior on the ground sprang to\nhis feet, let out a roar, and swung his\nsword at Fong Yu, who was charging\ntowards him. In an instant, a blood red\nblade of light flew out from the blade\nof the katana, heading straight for Fong\nYu&lt;unk&gt;s face. Holy crap, you said we\nwere going to play melee combat, and now\nyou're giving me this. Startled, Fong Yu\nimmediately stopped and dodged the blood\nred blade strike. since you want to play\nlong range firepower with me, then I'm\nsorry. So, Fong Yu put away the black\ngold ancient sword and under the male\nwarrior's surprised gaze, he took out a\nfull elemental combat staff and began\nchanting the incantation for wind blade.\nThis maneuver where a melee warrior\ninstantly transforms into a ranged mage,\ncompletely stunned the opposing male\nwarrior. Is this how you play games?\nWith your heavy plate armor, black and\ngold ancient sword, and that savage\ncharge, you're a standard berserker\nsetup. How did you switch to a mage in\nthe blink of an eye? Just as the male\nwarrior was stunned, Fong Yu's windb\nblade had already been formed and shot\ntowards the male warrior. This male\nwarrior was no ordinary person after\nall. He noticed the invisible windb\nblade flying towards him immediately. So\nhe shouted again and used his katana to\nunleash a blood red blade of light which\ndirectly shattered the wind blade\nreleased by Fong Yu. Fong Yu smiled\ncoldly and began chanting again. A\nmoment later, a 3 m long fire dragon\nwith scorching flames rose above Fong\nYu&lt;unk&gt;s head. This time, \"Let's&lt;unk&gt;\nsee if you can stop me!\" Fong Yu shouted\ncoldly. \"Prepare to die!\" The next\nsecond, the fire dragon in midair rushed\ntowards the male warrior. Seeing the\nfire dragon flying towards him. A hint\nof despair flashed in the male samurai's\neyes. He roared again and slashed his\npalm at the blade in his hand.\nInstantly, a strange scene appeared. A\nlarge amount of blood gushed from the\nwound on the male samurai's hand, but\nnot a drop was spilled. It was all\nabsorbed by the katana in his hand. When\nthe fire dragon flew to the male\nsamurai, the samurai's body was already\nas thin as a dried corpse. But the\nkatana in his hand had turned completely\ncrimson as if it were a bloodstained\nblade forged from fresh blood. The next\nsecond, the male warrior, who looked\nlike a dried corpse, raised his blood\nred sword and slashed at the fire dragon\nin midair. Instantly, a thick cloud of\nblood mist drifted out from the blade\nand transformed into a huge blood red\nskull in the blink of an eye, which\nswallowed the fire dragon in midair in\none gulp. Fony was startled when he saw\nthis. He didn't expect that the male\nwarrior had such a powerful trump card\nthat could destroy his intermediate fire\nmagic fire dragon technique in one fell\nswoop. At this moment, after the giant\nblood red skeleton in midair swallowed\nFong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s fire dragon, it opened its\nblood red M again and let out a piercing\nshriek, biting towards Fong Yu. Not only\ndid it absorb its own fire dragon\ntechnique, but it can still continue\nattacking. Surprised, Fong Yu sensed\nsomething was a miss and immediately\nactivated Wind Walker's guard. The\ninstant increase of three agility points\nraised his agility attribute from 9.90\nto over 12.90.\nOnce agility surpassed the critical\nvalue of 10, Fong Yu's speed experienced\na qualitative leap. With a dodge attack,\nhe leaped to the side about 3 m away,\ndodging the blood red skeleton's\ndevouring attack in midair. At the same\ntime, he switched from his staff to the\nhorned fong bow and three feathered\narrows drew the bow and fired at the\nmale warrior who looked like a dried\ncorpse not far away. In the blink of an\neye, three arrows accurately struck the\nmale warrior's head. Three arrows\nentered his eye sockets and one arrow\nentered his mouth. Three critical hits\nto vital organs. However, the mummified\nmale warrior did not fall. Instead, he\nturned his blade and pointed it at\nFongu. The blood red skeleton that had\nmissed its target changed direction\nagain and flew towards Fong Yu. Damn it.\nWhat is this thing? With no other\nchoice, Fong Yu could only dodge the\nblood red skeletons attack again. This\ntime, he put away his horned bow, took\nout two explosive packs, lit the fuses\nwith an instant flame, and threw them at\nthe mummified male warrior. I refuse to\nbelieve you can withstand explosives.\nSoon, the explosive charges landed at\nthe feet of the mummified corpse.\nBecause its eyes had been shot out, the\ncorpse was unaware that there were two\nsmoking explosive charges lying at its\nfeet. It once again waved its blood red\nblade at Fong Yu while the blood red\nskeleton in the air charged at Fong Yu\nfor the third time. Just then, boom,\nboom. Two violent explosions rang out,\nand the figure of the mummified male\nwarrior was engulfed by the flames. The\nblood red katana along with a severed\nhand spun twice in the air before\nfalling to the ground. Whereupon the\nblood on the blade slowly faded. As the\nblood on the blade faded, the blood red\nskeleton in midair let out a roar of\nunwilling anger before slowly\ndisappearing into the air. Call. Fongu\nbreathed a sigh of relief, patted his\nchest, and exclaimed, \"Thank goodness we\nalmost capsized in the gutter.\"\nMeanwhile, Olivia, who had arrived not\nfar away, breathed the sigh of relief\nand put the iron axe back on her back.\nWith the male warriors complete death,\nthe battle finally came to a complete\nend. Fong Yu walked to the katana lying\non the ground. Pride opened the severed\nhand, picked up the katana, and began to\nexamine it. Demon blade Miraa, purple\nepic, a legendary weapon brought in by\nthe player from their original world.\nLegend has it that all its previous\nowners died violent deaths, hence the\ntitle demon blade. In reality, it's\nbecause a blood sucking demon resides\nwithin the blade. When the demon is\ndeprived of fresh blood for an extended\nperiod, it will kill its master and seek\nanother. In eight skills, skill one,\nbloodblade slash, consumes 10 stamina\npoints, unleashing a blood red blade\nlight, capable of slaying targets within\n10 to 50 m, depending on the user\nstrength. Skill two, blood demon\nrebirth, consumes all stamina, summoning\nthe hidden demon from the blade to\nfight. The user's blood and soul will be\ndevoured by the blood demon, completely\nturning them into the demon blade\nservant, losing all self-awareness.\nCaution because this demonic sword\ncontains an evil spirit prolonged where\nwill cause the spirit within to\ngradually corrupt the user's mind,\neventually driving them into madness,\nleading them to slaughter those around\nthem or commit suicide. Use with extreme\ncaution. After reading the game\nassistants description of the demonic\nsword, Fongu immediately raised his\neyebrows. While this weapon's skills are\nindeed impressive, its negative\nattribute is simply too exaggerated,\nmaking it somewhat useless. All right,\nI'll keep it for now. I'll go back and\nhave Valentina check if she can remove\nthe evil spirit from this knife.\nAlthough doing so might lower the\nknife's grade, it's better than not\nbeing able to use it at all. After the\nfinal battle, Olivia began to direct the\nwalkers to reform their ranks and march\nout of the village in an orderly\nfashion, while Fongu directed the women\nto follow the walkers out of the village\nas well. After the women and the walkers\nleft the village, Olivia began to\nresurrect the enemies who had been\nkilled on the ground. She did not choose\nto resurrect the corpses whose heads or\nbodies had been smashed because\nrepairing the corpses would consume too\nmuch energy and she did not have much\nimmortal energy left. So in the end, she\nonly resurrected less than 300 corpses.\nAfter Olivia led the newly resurrected\nzombies out of the village, Fongu\nsummoned a fire dragon and began to set\nfire to the houses in the village. Soon\nthe entire village was engulfed in\nflames. Seeing this, Fong Yu smiled\nslightly and said, \"Murder and arson,\nthat's enough to make it complete.\" The\nreason Fong Yu set fire to the village\nwasn't because he had any wicked tastes,\nbut entirely to weaken the strength of\nDistrict 7. This raid is bound to make\nme a mortal enemy of the seventh\ndistrict lord's team. So, I should\nweaken their strength as much as\npossible so that when they return, they\nwon't even have a place to stay and\nwe'll be back to square one. If Olivia\nhadn't told Fong Yu that her immortal\nenergy was exhausted and she could no\nlonger revive corpses, Fong Yu would\nhave even wanted to lead this army of\nzombies directly into District 8 and\nwipe out all the enemies in districts 1,\n2, 9, and 10 in one fell swoop. Left\nwith no other choice, Fong Yu could only\nlead his army of over 800 zombies along\nwith 250 women who had surrendered to\nretreat towards District 6. Chapter 148,\nthe haunted house and the origins of the\nthree companions. After returning to\nDistrict 6, Fong Yu handed over the 250\nfemale players to Xiao Yini and her\ngroup who had come to meet him. This was\nsomething he had arranged in advance,\nand it was most appropriate for Xiao\nYini to take care of these women. This\nis Xiao Yini, the former president of\nour district's women's federation and\nnow the deputy city lord in charge of\npeople's livelihood in the Lord city.\nShe will take you to a temporary\nsettlement for people transferring from\nother districts. Fong Yu said to the\nwomen, \"Through her, you will understand\nthat our district takes great care of\nwomen's rights. There is no such thing\nas male chauvinism or women being\ntreated as slaves.\" Xiao Yini\nimmediately followed up with an\nexplanation. \"Yes, in our district,\nwomen enjoy the same rights and status\nas men and even enjoy priority\nprotection. You will definitely not be\ndisappointed if you transfer to our\ndistrict. After arranging the women's\nwhereabouts, Fong Yu felt relieved and\nled his army of zombies at full speed\ntowards the spider cave in the spider\nforest. Along the way, he also\nencountered several herds of wild boores\nand bison. Considering that he needed to\nprepare 100 wild boores for the dragon,\nFong Yu also directed the zombies to\nhunt down these herds of wild boars and\nbison, killing a total of 150 wild\nboores and 65 bison. Fong Yu dismembered\nthe massive bison and 50 wild boores,\nwhile the 100 wild boar carcasses were\ntransported whole by the zombie army.\nIncidentally, Fong Yu also found five\nwooden treasure chests and three bronze\ntreasure chests in the dens of these\nwild boar and bison. Of course, treasure\nchests of this level are no longer of\ninterest to Fong Yu, and he is too lazy\nto count the white and green items that\nhe gets. All he could think about now\nwas getting back as quickly as possible\nand starting to prepare his plan to hunt\ndown that dragon. As evening approached,\nFun Yu finally led the zombies back to\nthe manor. After the zombies laid down\nthe carcasses of 100 wild boores, Olivia\ntook them to the spider cave in the\neastern spider forest. Fongu went\nstraight back into the house and found\nValentina who had just come out of the\nroom. Tina, I need your help, Fongu\nsaid. It would be my pleasure, the\nfemale ghost said with a slight smile.\nWhat do you need me to do? Fong Yu took\nout the spider venom gland he had\nobtained from killing the human-faced\nspider last time from the warehouse and\nasked, \"Although I know that the toxin\nin this venom gland can affect dragons,\nI'm not sure if this venom gland can\nkill that dragon.\" Valentina asked in\nsurprise, \"You want to deal with that\ngiant dragon in the south?\" Fun nodded.\nBut Valentina frowned. Our current\nstrength is not enough to fight that\ndragon. That's why I asked you if this\nspider venom gland could kill that\ndragon. We can't beat it headon, but we\ncan use other methods. Valentina glanced\nat the spider venom gland in Fong\nYu&lt;unk&gt;s hand, frowned, and thought for\na moment before saying, \"Dragons are\nnaturally immune to most toxins. Even\nthis spider venom gland can only\nparalyze it for a short time.\" As\nexpected, Fong Yu said, somewhat\ndisappointed, but still asked, \"Could\nyou use alchemy to further enhance the\ntoxicity of this poison gland? Ideally,\nyou could refine a poison that could\nkill a giant dragon.\" Valentina nodded\nand said, \"That's possible, but we'll\nneed some other materials. What do you\nneed? I'll figure something out.\" Fongu\nperked up as soon as he heard there was\nhope. It didn't matter if he lacked\nmaterials. He had access to the exchange\nand could buy them there. If all else\nfailed, he could offer a high reward. If\nwe want to poison that dragon, we'll\nneed the stamon of the blood soul demon\nflower, the gallbladder of the\ntwo-headed poisonous python, and the\nvenom glands of a silver-winged\ncentipede that's over 50 years old. Wait\na minute. Fongu interrupted Valentina,\nlooking bewildered, and asked, \"These\nthings seem really hard to get, don't\nthey?\" Valentina nodded and said,\n\"Indeed, the blood soul demon flower is\na poisonous flower that grows by the\nbloodpool in the demon realm. The\ntwo-headed poisonous python is in the\nhowling rift in the north of the\ncontinent. As for the silverwing\ncentipede, it is relatively common, but\nthose over 50 years old are rare.\" Fongu\nshook his head, both amused and\nexasperated. He didn't even need to open\nthe exchange to know that no player\nwould have these things. Not to mention\nthe flower from the demon realm. Even if\na player encountered the two-headed\npoisonous python and the silverwinged\ncentipede, they would probably be dead\nby then. It was highly unlikely that\nanyone could obtain those materials.\nThen let's settle for second best. I\ndon't even need to poison that dragon to\ndeath. Just think of some common\npoisonous materials that can slightly\nenhance the venom of this spider's venom\nglands. How about that? Then you need to\nprepare some poisonous mushrooms such as\nred umbrella mushrooms and green\numbrella mushrooms for me as well as\npoisonous insects, snakes, toads, or\nother poisonous things. Give me as much\nas you can find, and I can try to\nconcoct a potion with the venom glands\nof a demon spider as the main poison.\nThat's fine. Fongu then opened the\nexchange and searched for all items\nrelated to poison. He quickly bought up\ndozens of poisons that he could find and\nhanded them over to Valentina. That's\nall we can find. The rest is up to you.\nValentina nodded, but still asked with\nconcern. Master, do we really have to\ndeal with that dragon? Actually, we can\nwait a bit longer. It's not too late to\nkill it when we're stronger. Funu sighed\nhelplessly and said, \"It's not that I\ndon't want to wait, but that dragon has\nalready come after us. You don't know.\"\nDuring the day that dragon went to\nKing's Landing, burned down a lot of\nhouses, and killed a lot of people. If I\nhad arrived any later, the city would\nprobably have been massacred. Valentina\ngasped in surprise, covering her mouth.\nSo, that's how it is. No wonder. Later,\nOlivia negotiated with that dragon, but\nit completely disregarded her. If I\nhadn't invoked the dark god to pressure\nit, it probably wouldn't have left. Even\nwith the dark god, it didn't seem\nparticularly afraid. At this point, Fong\nYu suddenly remembered something and\nasked, \"By the way, what's this about\nthe dark god? Why didn't you tell me\nbefore? Also, what's the meaning of the\ndragon mentioning the sealed land?\"\nAfter a moment of silence, Valentina\nsighed and said, \"I was planning to tell\nyou this when you were stronger, but\nsince you asked, I'll tell you now.\nActually, this haunted house and our\norigins are all related to the god of\ndarkness. Valentina then began to\nrecount her story. Chapter 149, survival\ngame, God's gamble. Actually, there are\ntwo main gods in this world. The god of\nlight and the god of darkness. This\napproach sounds a bit old-fashioned.\nFunu couldn't help but complain. What\ndid you say? Nothing. You can continue.\nValentina continued, \"Originally, the\ngod of light and the god of darkness\nwere supreme deities above the heavens,\nuntouchable. But one day, for some\nunknown reason, those two main gods made\na bet. A bet?\" Fongu raised an eyebrow\nand said, \"They're gods, yet they still\nlike to gamble. Shouldn't they just go\nfor it?\" Valentina glared at Fong Yu\nspeechlessly. \"Okay, okay, I was wrong.\nYou can continue. I won't interrupt\nyou.\" Fong Yu said with a fawning smile.\nValentina continued, somewhat annoyed.\nThe bet between the two supreme deities\nwas about whether order should be\nreshaped. What does this mean? The gods\ncreated the Titans using themselves as a\nmodel to govern the world. Over the long\nyears, feeling lonely, the Titans\ncreated many other races as their pets.\nThe first race they created was the\ndragons, making them the most powerful\nof all races. Then came the other races\nin the world such as the Titan cat you\nencountered in the dungeon and other\npowerful magical beasts. Humans were the\nlast race to be created. Why does the\nmore we create the weaker we become?\nBecause this world is too fragile,\nValentina explained. The world will\ncollapse with just a thought from the\nSupreme God. While the titans can\nshatter mountains and cause earthquakes\nwith a mere gesture. Even the dragons\ncan easily disrupt the ecological\nbalance of this world. Therefore, in\norder to curb the destruction these\ncreatures cause to this world, the\nTitans have imposed strict limits on the\npower of the races they created. And\nthen what? What does this have to do\nwith the wager between the god of light\nand the god of darkness? As punishment\nfor the Titans unauthorized creation of\nlife, the god of light stripped the\ntitans of their authority over this\nworld and took them back to the divine\nrealm. The world, now deprived of the\nTitan's control, quickly descended into\nchaos as all races vied for supremacy\nand at one point nearly perished. This\nangered the god of light. So he decided\nto purge all life from this world,\npurify it, and restore order to all\nthings. But then the god of darkness\nappeared. He believed that as the chief\ngod, he should not interfere in the\nsurvival of mortal beings and should let\nthem live and die on their own. Hearing\nthis, Fong Yu said with a surprised\nexpression. If you hadn't mentioned\nthis, I would have thought the god of\ndarkness was going to destroy the world.\nIt turns out it's the opposite. How is\nthe outcome of the bet determined? Funu\nasked again. Valentina sighed and said,\n\"Alas, due to the appearance of the dark\ngod, the light god's purification plan\nhad to be temporarily shelfd. So, the\ntwo chief gods made that bet. The god of\nlight believes that a stable order is\nimpossible in this world, especially\nafter he has reviewed the history of\nthese races. He asserts that this world\nwill eventually be destroyed by these\nraces. The dark god believes that the\nuniverse was also in chaos and disorder\nat the beginning and the later order\nincluding the gods was born from that\nchaos and disorder. So the beings in\nthis world are the same. Although it is\nchaotic now, perhaps a stable order can\nbe born from this chaos. What if it\ncan't be born? We don't even need the\ngod of light to intervene. This world\nwill ultimately be destroyed by\nourselves. H Fongu gasped. Sigh. To\ngamble with the lives of all living\nbeings in this world is truly a huge\nbet. Valentina nodded and said, \"So the\ngod of light agreed to the god of\ndarkness's wager. So what was the bet\nbetween them?\" Funu asked curiously.\nValentina shook her head and said, \"We\ndon't know the stakes, but the power of\nthe dark god is waning day by day, and\nhe has now fallen into a long slumber.\nTherefore, we guess that the loser will\nperish.\" After thinking for a moment,\nFong Yu said, \"That's not right. The bet\nisn't over yet. So, how can the power of\nthe dark god be diminishing?\" Valentina\nsaid with a rise smile. Actually, this\nbet isn't just a single game, but rather\na game every thousand years. This is the\n10th game and also the last one. What\nwere the results of the previous nine\nmatches? The god of light has won in the\nwhole thing. For the past 9,000 years,\nno civilization has been able to\nestablish a stable order. Chaos and war\nhave never stopped. Upon hearing this,\nFong Yu suddenly remembered the words\nthe game assistant had given him when he\nfirst entered the game, saying that this\nwas a survival game concerning the life\nand death of all mankind. He hadn't\nthought about it deeply before, but\nafter learning these details from\nValentina, he finally realized that this\nsurvival game was actually far more\ncomplicated than he had imagined. It\nturns out that this game is a gamble\nbetween gods and these players are very\nlikely pawns in the gamble between the\ngod of light and the god of darkness.\nUltimately, whether these players will\nestablish a stable order in this world\nor perish in conflict remains to be\nseen. Therefore, this gamble or rather\nthis game not only determines the\noutcome between the two main gods, but\nalso the life and death of everyone\ninvolved. After learning the true\nmeaning of the dark god, this world, and\nthe game he was involved in, Fun Yu\nasked another question. Then, what is\nyour connection to this haunted house?\nAnd to you, Olivia, Alpha, and the god\nof darkness? Valentina replied, since\nthere is a god of light and a god of\ndarkness, there will naturally be\nfollowers who follow them. Those who\nbelieve in the god of light are\nfollowers of light, and those who\nbelieve in the god of darkness are\nfollowers of darkness. I, Olivia, and\nAlpha are all followers of the god of\ndarkness. And we have all dedicated\neverything to him. Then this haunted\nhouse, this haunted house, this dark\nforest, and even this island are all the\nformer sight of the dark god's dark\ntemple. However, due to the 9,000-year\nwars of the previous 9,000 years, the\ntemple no longer exists, leaving only\nthis dilapitated wooden house that you\nsaw back then. This is why that dragon\ndares not come here. Then I, you are the\nchosen representative of this final\nthousand-year wager by the god of\ndarkness, which is why you inherited\nthis haunted house and the will of the\ngod of darkness. Our purpose is to\nassist you in winning this final\nthousand-year wager. Chapter 15 raid on\ndistrict 5. Fongu felt a little\nconfused. He was just an ordinary\nperson. But now someone suddenly told\nhim, \"You are a representative of the\ngods, and your future will determine the\nlife and death of all mankind.\" At this\nmoment, he couldn't help but wonder if\nthe god of darkness had chosen the wrong\nperson. What admirable qualities does he\npossess that make the dark god entrust\nhim with such an important task? Or are\nyou saying you've already lost nine out\nof 10 games, so you're just giving up\nand planning to tank in the last game?\nThey actually want an ordinary person to\nestablish a stable and peaceful social\norder in this lost world. You're\noverestimating me, aren't you? Fongu\nsighed helplessly and returned to his\nbedroom. He needed to think about and\nprocess this information. Valentina\nglanced at Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s retreating\nfigure as he walked into the bedroom and\nsighed slightly, but she believed that\nFong Yu should be able to face it\ncalmly. Valentina's idea was correct.\nFong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s strong adaptability was\none of his strengths. In any case, I'm\nalready a piece on that chessboard, so I\nmight as well make the best of it and\nfocus on preserving my position as a\npiece. Although no one wants to be used\nas a pawn, he doesn't have the strength\nto overturn the game right now. So, he'd\nbetter play it safe and develop his\nstrength cautiously. So, let's proceed\nstep by step. First, we need to quickly\nimprove our own strength. Then keep an\neye on the developments in King's\nLanding and try to deal with the\ncombined forces of the Eighth District\nsafely before making any further moves.\nAs for things like saving the world,\nthere's no need to think about them for\nnow. It's pointless anyway, and that\ngamble between gods is something he\ncan't control either. After making up\nhis mind, Fongu left his bedroom and\nwent into the kitchen to cook dinner.\nAfter dinner, he began to deal with the\n100 wild boores in the yard, which\nseemed no different from usual.\nValentina, Olivia, and Alfa exchanged\nglances inside the room. \"The master\nseems to have a pretty good mental\nfortitude,\" Olivia said. Valentina\nreplied irritably. \"Oh my god, you\ndidn't just realize that now? This is\none of the few shining points of the\nmaster.\" Olivia rolled her eyes and\nreplied, \"Would it kill you to speak\nproperly?\"\n\" Valentina raised her chin and flew\nonto the roof beam.\" At this moment,\nAlfa also barked a few times. Olivia\nnodded and said, \"I think so, too.\"\nAlthough he didn't start from a high\npoint, he grew very quickly, and his\ntalent is truly amazing. Valentina,\nperched on the roof beam, said, \"More\nimportantly, he has a bit of\nbenevolence, but not much. A bit of\nmurderous intent, but not much. A bit of\ngreed, but still not much. and a bit of\nlust, but still not much. He's like a\nstrange man walking on the edge of light\nand darkness, someone I can't quite\nunderstand. Valentina has lived a long\nlife, and there are very few people she\ncannot see through. These words made\nOlivia and Alfa look at her with some\nsurprise. Looking at Fong Yu outside,\nwho was leisurely preparing to roast a\nwild boar, Olivia made a conclusion.\nPerhaps it was precisely because of his\nenigmatic nature that the god of\ndarkness chose him as the final\nrepresentative. Woof! Alpha barked\nsoftly in agreement. Valentina smiled\nslightly and began to hum a melodious\ntune. Fong Yu, who was outside, was\nunaware of the conversation between his\nthree companions inside. He first set up\na large bonfire and lit it. To preserve\nthe wild boar's integrity, he didn't use\nany special cooking techniques. Instead,\nhe simply used his long sword to gut the\nboar, collected its internal organs\nusing the system, and then roasted it\nover a fire. During the grilling\nprocess, he added a lot of salt, cumin,\nand chili for seasoning. He did this to\nmake the roasted wild boar taste more\ntempting. No, it should be said to be an\nenticement. With these complex aromomas\nmasking the poison, Fong Yu could then\ncarry out his plan. put the poison\nValentina had prepared into the roasted\npig so that the dragon would swallow it.\nHe even had a backup plan. Instead of\nsending the poisonous roasted pig\ntomorrow, he would send 10 non-poisonous\nroasted pigs first to lower the dragon's\nguard. When the second batch is sent out\nthe day after tomorrow, the poison will\nbe mixed in again. Once the poison takes\neffect, Fong Yu along with Olivia and\nAlpha will seize the opportunity to kill\nhim while he's still weakened. During\nthe break from roasting the pig, Song\nJaming also sent the latest battle\nreport from the Viking Emperor in\nDistrict 8. After Fong Yu resolved the\nthreat from District 7, the Viking\nEmperor of District 8 deployed all his\nforces to the border of districts 8 and\n9 and established multiple lines of\ndefense to effectively block the Allied\nforces from districts 1, 2, 9, and 10.\nHowever, due to a severe shortage of\nmanpower, he could only continuously\nshrink his defensive lines. The Viking\nEmperor's idea is that if possible, he\nwants District 6 to launch another\nattack on District 7 tomorrow, aiming to\ncompletely eliminate the Lord of\nDistrict 7. This way, even if the Viking\nEmperor's lines are breached, he can\nretreat towards District 7. After much\ndeliberation, Fong Yu refused Viking\nEmperor's request because news had also\ncome from Lie Chun Long that a large\nnumber of players had set up camp at the\nborder of zones five and six and that\nzone 6 might be attacked tomorrow.\nHelping strategic allies is necessary,\nbut only if one's own safety is\nguaranteed. Therefore, Fong Yu could\nonly have Song Jimming focus the defense\nefforts on the borders of districts 5\nand six. In response, the Viking emperor\nreplied that he understood. Sigh. It's\nlike when it rains, it pours. Funu\nsighed, brushing oil onto the roasted\npig as he said to Olivia beside him.\nTomorrow we have to deliver wild boar to\nthe dragon and also intercept a new\nenemy. I feel like I'm running out of\nthings to do. But then Olivia said, \"Why\ndoes it have to be tomorrow?\" \"Huh? What\ndo you mean?\" Fongu was stunned. Olivia\nreplied calmly. We can take advantage of\nthe knight to launch a surprise attack\non those enemies. Upon hearing this,\nFongu was slightly takenback, then\nslapped his thigh and said, \"That's\nright. Why do we have to wait until\ndaytime now that we have this army of\nzombies, even if we go out at night? No\nmonster should dare to attack us.\"\nOlivia nodded and said, \"It's perfect\nthat we can bring Valentino along for\nlarge-scale group operations. Her\nabilities are much more useful than\nmine.\" After Olivia reminded him, Fong\nYu also remembered that Valentino was an\nall-elemental battle mage, and the level\nis incredibly high, at least at the\nlevel of a grandmaster. As for dealing\nwith those allied forces, just\nunleashing a few highle AoE spells would\nbe enough to wipe out a large number of\nenemies. You're right. Then go to the\nspider cave and bring the army over now.\nI'll go talk to Valentina. Fongu threw\ndown the oil brush in his hand and\nwalked towards the house. A moment\nlater, Fong Yu led Valentina to the\ncourtyard outside the house, while\nOlivia led the zombie army to the\noutside of the manor. Having learned\nfrom the previous experience of being\nlured away by that female player named\nLeong Pinking, Fongu naturally wouldn't\nleave the manor unguarded again.\nAlthough there were magic vines in the\nyard, these were extraordinary times,\nand to be on the safe side, Fong Yu\ndecided to leave Alpha to guard the\nhouse. Fong Yu looked down at the dog\nand said, \"The important task of\nguarding the house is now in your\nhands.\" Alpha nodded obediently,\nnaturally understanding the importance\nof the haunted house to them. So, under\nthe cover of darkness, Fongu led\nValentina, Olivia, and the army of\nzombies toward the border of District 5.\nGuarded by more than 600 zombies, Fongu\ndid not encounter any monsters that\ndared to confront them head-on. Even\nwhen they met a nearly 5 meter long\nstriped giant tiger on the way, the\ntiger turned and plunged into the forest\nas soon as it saw the vast marching\narmy. Sigh. That guy ran really fast.\nWatching the giant tiger disappear into\nthe forest. Fongu said regretfully, \"If\nonly I could kill that guy and then\nresurrect him as a zombie to be my\nmount, that would be perfect.\" Upon\nhearing this, Olivia said, \"How about I\nlead the troops to pursue that giant\ntiger. Forget it. Forget it.\" Fongu\nwaved his hand and said, \"Our purpose in\ncoming here is to launch a night raid on\nDistrict 5. We can't let a tiger affect\nour plans. Let's go.\" Because of the\ndarkness, the marching speed was much\nslower than during the day, and it took\nthe entire team more than 2 hours to\nreach the boundary of districts 5 and\nsix. Fong Yu did not choose to meet up\nwith Lie Chun Long, but simply told him\nto guard his own camp and not to make\nany rash moves, even if he heard any\ncommotion from District 5. The reason\nFong Yu didn't allow Lie Chinlong&lt;unk&gt;s\nforce of over 500 men to join him, was\nbecause he was worried that if a real\nbattle broke out, he wouldn't be able to\ntake care of those men. Moreover, with\nOlivia commanding their army of over 600\nzombies, they moved in perfect unison\nand were fearless in the face of death.\nIf Lie Chinlong's 500 plus players were\nto join in, it would actually affect the\ncombat efficiency of this force.\nImmediately following the intelligence\nprovided by Li Chin Long, Fong Yu made\nhis way towards the nearest enemy camp.\nHowever, as Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s army was\ntraversing a dense forest, Valentina\nsuddenly floated to Fong Yu and Olivia's\nside and said, \"Stop advancing.\" Upon\nhearing this, Olivia immediately used\nher mind to stop the zombie army.\n\"What's going on?\" Funu asked, puzzled.\nValentina pointed in the direction they\nwere heading and said, \"Master, there\nare hundreds of people heading this way\nabout 500 m ahead.\" M Fongu raised an\neyebrow and said, \"You can detect it\nfrom a distance of 500 m.\" Valentina\nsmiled sheepishly. \"I used to be able to\ndetect enemies 5 km away, but now my\ncapabilities are not what they used to\nbe, so I can only detect this far.\"\nFongu had become somewhat immune to\nValentina's Versailike remarks, so he\nturned to Olivia and said, \"Wait for\nthem to come over.\" And then as he\nspoke, he gestured with his hand across\nhis neck. Under the cover of night,\n\"Anyone sneaking in from district 5\ncould only be an enemy, not a friendly\nforce, so Fu naturally wouldn't show any\nmercy.\" Olivia nodded and said, \"The\nbest way is to wait for the enemy to\ntire themselves out and not to alert\nthem.\" So 5 minutes later, a group of\nburly men making their way into district\n6 in the dark encountered another group\nof even larger burly zombies in this\ndense forest. Then amidst a series of\nscreams, these burly men perished in the\ndark woods. A moment later, Valentina\nfloated back from the depths of the\nforest and said to Fong Yu, \"A total of\n503 people, including those who escaped,\nhave all been killed.\" Fong Yu shook his\nhead, somewhat amused and exasperated.\nThose dead guys on the other side were\nreally unlucky. They were planning to\nwipe out the camp in District 6 under\nthe cover of darkness, but they never\nexpected to run into Fong Yu's\nterrifying zombie army. Then Fong Yu\nasked Olivia, \"Can she be resurrected?\"\nOlivia nodded and said, \"My immortal\nenergy hasn't fully recovered yet, so I\ncan only revive about 300 bodies. All\nright, let's revive as many as we can.\nWe'll keep the rest of the corpses for\nnow and deal with them when we get back.\nAs a result, half an hour later, Fong\nYu's zombie army, which originally\nconsisted of only 632 people, grew to\n930 people. So, Fong Yu led his 933man\nforce toward the nearest enemy camp. 15\nminutes later, Fong Yu arrived at an\nempty military camp. Needless to say,\nthe people in this camp must be the\ngroup who died in the dense forest. Fong\nYu then led his troops to sneak towards\nthe next enemy camp. Half an hour later,\nFong Yu led his troops to the second\nmilitary camp location that Lee Shunlong\nhad marked for him. The enemy camp was\nlocated on the riverbank in an open\narea. It was surrounded by a semi-ircle\nof simple wooden shoddaf and fences. And\ninside were rows of simple tents,\nperhaps to prevent monsters from\nattacking at night. A dozen giant\nbonfires were piled up around the camp\nand three wooden arrow towers were even\nbuilt on the edge of the camp, each with\ntwo archers. However, the archers did\nnot seem to expect anyone to attack\ntheir camp at night, so they were mostly\ndozing off. After all, it's almost 1:00\na.m., which is the time when people are\nmost likely to feel sleepy. So, Fongu\nturned to Olivia and asked her how to\nlaunch a surprise attack on the camp.\nAfter all, he now knew that Olivia had\nonce led a million strong army and was\nknown as the overlord. In comparison, as\na novelist, I'm not even qualified to\ncarry someone else's shoes, at least not\nin military matters. One must have\nself-awareness. The biggest taboo in\nmilitary strategy is for an amateur to\nlead an expert. Fu understands this\nprinciple. Chapter 151. This life is\nexhausting. Olivia's plan was\nactually quite simple. Just go for a\nbasic attack. For her, taking down this\npoorly constructed camp was a piece of\ncake. There were about 200 tents in the\nentire camp. And judging by the size of\nthe tents, each tent could only sleep a\nmaximum of four people. That means there\nwere at most 800 people in the camp.\nWith 930 zombies, including over a 100\ndwarf zombies, their fighting strength\nis enough to rival a 3,000 strong battle\ngroup. Moreover, they launched a night\nraid during the early morning hours when\nthe enemy was most relaxed. Even if a\npig were in command, it would be a sure\nwin. However, Olivia made a small\nrequest that Fong Yu use his wind blades\nto take out the archers on the arrow\ntowers approaching their direction. This\nwas a piece of cake for Fong Yu. Fong Yu\neven asked if he should use the fire\ndragon technique to burn down the tents,\nbut Olivia refused. The walkers can move\nfreely in the dark, but the humans\ncannot. Even if you set the tents on\nfire, it will be difficult to burn the\nenemies inside, but it will increase the\nlight in the camp, which will actually\nweaken the walker's advantage. Moreover,\nthe walkers are most afraid of fire, and\nfire will also make them instinctively\nfearful. So, it is better not to light\nit. Fun nodded. This was something he\nhadn't expected since he didn't know\nmuch about the characteristics of these\nzombies. After all communication was\ncompleted, Olivia gave the order and the\nzombies hiding in the dense forest\nlaunched an attack on the camp. When the\nfigures of the walkers appeared in the\nlight of the campfire, an archer on the\nnearest arrow tower was the first to\nspot the suddenly appearing enemies. But\njust as he was about to shout to his\ncomrades in the camp, an invisible wind\nblade sliced across his neck. Before he\ncould even utter a sound, he felt a\ndizzying sensation and then found\nhimself falling from the arrow tower to\nthe ground. To be precise, it was his\nhead that fell to the ground. Then\neverything proceeded as planned. The\npigheaded zombies at the front used\ntheir giant shields to smash a huge hole\nin the wooden fence, and the dwarf\nzombies and human zombies behind them\nfiled in and stormed into the camp where\nthey began to slaughter everyone. The\nscreams and shouts in the military camp\nsubsided in less than 10 minutes. Yet\nanother enemy camp had been wiped out by\nthe zombie army. Soon, Olivia, who had\naccompanied the zombies into the\nmilitary camp, returned to Fong Yu, who\nwas observing from the outside and said,\n\"We couldn't hold on to one enemy. He\nescaped.\" \"Oh, there are actually people\nyou can't keep.\" Valentina teased from\nthe side. Olivia rolled her eyes at the\nfemale ghost and said, \"I chopped that\nguy with an axe and then he turned into\na bat and flew away. I can't fly, so of\ncourse I couldn't stop him. bats? Could\nthey be vampires? Valentina asked\ncuriously. I never imagined there were\nvampires mixed in with those ordinary\npeople. Is that strange? Olivia said\nirritably. I just killed a werewolf, but\nI didn't give it a chance to transform.\nI just chopped its head off with an axe.\nOomph. All she does is fight and kill\nall day long. She's not like a woman at\nall. Valentina mocked again. Then you're\nbetter than me. You don't even have a\nbody. You're not even human. you. At\nthis moment, Fong Yu, seeing that things\nwere not going well, quickly stood\nbetween the female knight and the female\nghost and said in a humble tone, \"All\nright, all right, ladies. Now is not the\ntime to quarrel. Since someone has run\naway, our whereabouts have been exposed.\nLet's quickly go inside and pack up and\nthen leave.\" Olivia and Valentina\nexchanged a glare upon hearing this and\nthen entered the military camp with Fong\nYu. It was only then that Fong Yu began\nto regret not bringing Lie Chan Long and\nthe others along. It was unrealistic to\nexpect him to search for supplies for\nthe entire military camp by himself.\nEven if it took him 10 seconds to loot a\nsingle bag, it would still take him more\nthan 2 hours to loot supplies for 800\npeople. Headache. In the end, there was\nno other way because the zombies\ncouldn't do the work of collecting\nsupplies. Fongu had to ask Olivia and\nValentina to help collect supplies.\nFortunately, Valentina's mental strength\nwas strong enough. She was basically in\ncharge of taking the backpacks off the\ncorpses and placing them in front of\nFongu, who would then lick them. Even\nso, it took Fongu an hour to lick up all\n800 plus backpacks. But fortunately, no\nenemies attacked them during that hour.\nBut upon closer reflection, given the\nfighting strength of their zombie unit,\nwhich was able to wipe out an 800 strong\nmilitary camp in 10 minutes, it's likely\nthat enemies in other military camps\nwouldn't dare to come easily. After\nFongu finished licking up all the\nbackpacks, Valentina also absorbed all\nthe soul power here. It was just a pity\nabout the corpses on the ground. Olivia\ndidn't have the energy to revive them,\nso she had to give up. So the group led\nthe zombie corps back towards district\n6. What? The third legion has been wiped\nout. How is this possible? In a\nsettlement in the heart of district 5,\nLord Arthur Stark of district 5 stood in\nthe largest manner, angrily shouting,\n730 men. A full 730 men. Damn it. Even\n730 pigs couldn't have been killed in 10\nminutes. What on earth happened? One of\nhis men replied. According to messages\nsent by the soldiers in the camp before\nthey died, they seem to have been\nattacked by a large number of monsters.\nMonster? What monster? Stark asked,\nfrowning. It said that there's a group\nof fully armed pigheaded men and some\ngreen-haired giants I've never seen\nbefore. I think they're called crypt\ndwarves. Anyway, those monsters are\nterrifying and fearless. According to\nthe last soldier who sent the message,\n\"Those monsters won't die even if\nthey're cut into pieces like the\nlegendary undead creatures.\" Stark fell\nsilent. At this moment, his subordinate\nadded, \"According to intelligence, the\n500 strong allied force from District 4\nthat went missing in the forest on the\nborder of District 6 also seems to have\nbeen attacked by those undead monsters.\"\nBorder of undead monster zone 6. Stark\nnarrowed his eyes as if he had thought\nof something, then opened the chat\nchannel, found the chat list of Lord St.\nPaul Luther of District 4, and sent a\nmessage. Arthur Stark, Mr. Luther, you\nasked me to keep an eye out for news\nabout dark creatures. I wonder if undead\ncreatures that cannot be killed count as\ndark creatures. A moment later, a reply\ncame. St. Paul Luther, Mr. Stark, as you\npredicted, both the undead and the\nundead belong to the dark side. From\nwhat you're saying, it seems you\nencountered these monsters. Arthur\nStark. Yes, my Third Legion was wiped\nout by an army of undead just minutes\nago. Furthermore, intelligence indicates\nthat the 500 strong force you dispatched\nappears to have also been wiped out by\nthat same undead army. St. Paul Luther.\nYes, as I expected, it seems we have all\nbeen attacked by dark creatures. Arthur\nStark. Mr. Luther, it sounds like you\nalready knew about this dark army all\nalong. St. Paul Luther. To be honest,\nMr. Stark, I have received guidance from\nthe god of light. Among us players lies\na wicked and terrifying representative\nof the god of darkness who will bring us\nutter destruction. In fact, if he is\nallowed to develop unchecked, he might\neven destroy the entire world. St. Paul\nLuther and those undead monsters are\nvery likely the army of the dark god\nspokesperson who has already begun to\nact, slaughtering the creatures he\nencounters. Seeing this, Lord Stark of\nDistrict 5 also panicked a little, an\nevil figure lurking among the players, a\ndark undead creature, a force destined\nto destroy the world, he finally stood\nout from the crowd and became a lord of\nhis own domain. How could he have\nencountered such a terrible thing? Just\nas Stark was in a panic, St. Paul sent\nanother message. St. Paul Luther, but\ndon't worry, my friend. The God of light\nfavors us and he has chosen a\nrepresentative from among us players to\nguide us on the path of light. Help us\ndefeat evil and dispel darkness. And I,\nSt. Paul Luther, am that person, the\nspokesperson for the god of light, the\nspokesperson for the god of darkness?\nWhy does it feel like there's something\nfishy going on here? Stark raised an\neyebrow, pondered for a moment, and then\ntentatively replied, \"So, Mr. Luther,\nsince you say you are the spokesperson\nof the God of light, will you eliminate\nthose terrible undead creatures for us?\nTo everyone's surprise, St. Paul\nimmediately replied, \"Of course. It is\nmy duty to deal with these filthy undead\ncreatures. However, I am afraid I cannot\ncompletely extinguish that dark force on\nmy own. So, I hope everyone can unite.\"\nArthur Stark, you mean? St. Paul Luther,\nlet's inform the other six lords of the\nalliance what just happened and then\norganize an army to crush the dark\nforces hiding in district 6. What do you\nthink, Arthur Stark? Great idea. Let's\ndo it. After traveling through the night\nfor more than an hour, Fong Yu finally\nreturned to the manor. It was already\npast 400 a.m. Exhausted from a day's\nwork. After instructing Olivia to take\nthe zombie army back to the spider cave,\nhe finally couldn't hold on any longer\nand fell asleep on the bed without even\ntaking a shower. Before dawn the next\nday, Fa was awakened by a barrage of\nmessages from Song Jiming and Lie\nChunlong, which frightened him into\nthinking that the enemy was taking\nadvantage of the situation to attack\nKing's Landing. Upon opening the\nmessage, Song Jimming stated that the\nLord of District 5 had been hurling\ninsults at District 6 in the world chat,\naccusing them of lacking martial ethics,\nlaunching a nighttime attack on their\ncitizens and killing thousands of them.\nHe demanded that the Lord of District 6\nimmediately apologize and provide\ncompensation, or else he would make\nthings difficult for District 6. Lee\nChunlong&lt;unk&gt;s words were simpler. For\nsome reason, all six military camps on\nthe border of districts five and six\nhave been withdrawn. I'm asking Fong Yu\nwhat to do next. Continue guarding the\nborder or return to King's Landing.\nHelpless, Fongu could only force himself\nto stay awake and reply to Song Jumming,\ntelling him to tell those lords from\nother districts to shut up and stop\ntalking nonsense. They wanted an\napology, but no compensation. If they\nhad the guts, they could come to\nDistrict 6 and get it themselves. As for\nLie Chun Long, after a moment's thought,\nFong Yu decided to have him remain at\nthe border and return to King&lt;unk&gt;s\nLanding if there was still no movement\nby nightfall. After arranging things for\nthe two of them, Fongu sighed helplessly\nand said, \"Ugh, this life is so damn\ntiring.\" After saying that, he lay down\nand went back to sleep. Chapter 152.\nHeading to the dragon's lair. Fong Yu\nslept until noon, then was woken up by a\nburning smell. Holy crap, fire. Fong Yu\njumped out of bed and rushed out of the\nbedroom in his shorts. He looked around\nbut couldn't find any fire, not even the\ncampfire in the fireplace. That's\nstrange. Where is this burnt smell\ncoming from? Just as Fongu was wondering\nwhat was going on, Alpha crawled out of\nits kennel, dragged it to the kitchen\ndoor, and barked. Woof! Fongu went to\nthe kitchen and saw that the kitchen was\nfilled with smoke and that the iron pot\non the stove was burning. Olivia was\nfrantically trying to put out the flames\nin the pot with a bucket of water in\nfront of the counter. However, after the\nbucket of water was poured in, the\nflames were not only not put out, but\nthey even shot up higher. Ah! Olivia\ncried out in fright and backed away.\n\"Fongu!\" Fongu was stunned by this\nscene. Fong Yu, both amused and\nexasperated, walked into the kitchen and\napproached Olivia. He said softly, \"All\nright, leave this to me.\" With that, he\ngently pushed the blushing Olivia out of\nthe kitchen. Arriving at the kitchen\ncounter, Fun Yu first covered the iron\npot with a lid to extinguish the fire\ninside. Then he opened the window and\nused the dance of the wind to blow all\nthe smoke and dust out of the kitchen.\nHe then began to wash the pot and start\ncooking again. 20 minutes later, Fong Yu\nbrought two egg and steak sandwiches and\none steak to the living room and said\nwith a smile, \"Dinner's ready. I might\nbe a bit busy today, so I'll keep it\nsimple. Alpha immediately jumped onto\nthe chair and started eating the steak\nwith his tongue, while Olivia looked at\nthe sandwich Fongu placed in front of\nher and said with great shame, \"I'm\nsorry, master. I can't even do something\nas simple as cooking right, and I almost\nburned the house down.\" \"Haha,\" Fongu\nlaughed nonchalantly. \"That's normal.\nNobody's omnipotent. As the saying goes,\neveryone has their own expertise. Your\ntalent lies in military affairs and\ncombat, so not being able to cook is\nreally a minor matter. By the way, I\nheard you used to be the eldest princess\nof the empire and later became the\nruler. You must have lived in\nmagnificent palaces before, right? It's\na bit of a hardship for you to be stuck\nin this little wooden house with me now.\nFongu's words warmed Olivia's heart, and\nshe smiled brightly. Olivia Lane's trust\nlevel plus 30. Lynn's current trust\nlevel 510. Your relationship with Olivia\nRyan has upgraded from trust to respect.\nRecently, Fongu has been mostly acting\nwith Olivia and before he knew it, their\ntrust level had reached 500, which\nsurprised Fongu. He remembered that the\ngame assistant had said that when the\ntrust level reaches 500, these partners\nwill tell him some of their secrets. I\nwonder what Olivia's secret is. Sure\nenough, Olivia smiled at Fong Yu and\nsaid, \"Master, I actually have a way to\neliminate all those enemies at once.\"\nUpon hearing this, Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s heart\nstirred and he smiled slightly. Tell me\nabout it. 30 mi to the north, there is\nan ancient battlefield where hundreds of\nthousands of warriors who died in the\nwar over the last thousand years are\nburied. I can go there to resurrect them\nand make them your army. Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s\neyebrows shot up at the mention of\nhundreds of thousands. If he could\nreally revive hundreds of thousands of\nzombies, then sweeping through the other\neight regions would be a piece of cake.\nHowever, it seems that the immortal\nenergy you possess now cannot revive so\nmany zombies, right? Funu asked\ndoubtfully. It's impossible to resurrect\nso many at once. Right now, I can\nresurrect about 1,000 zombies a day, but\nwe can take it slowly and resurrect a\nfew each day. That's a pretty good idea.\nTo be honest, Fongu was very interested.\nHe opened the map interface and took a\nlook. 30 mi to the north was a vacuum\nzone surrounded by 10 regions. He had\nbeen curious about what would be in the\ncentral area before, but now he knew\nthat it was an ancient battlefield. So\nhe said, \"Okay, after I deliver the\nroasted pig to that dragon today, I'll\ngo there with you to take a look.\" After\nlunch, Fongu stored the 20 roasted whole\npigs in the arch mage storage ring and\nthen headed south towards the dragon's\nlair with Olivia and Alpha. After\nwalking about 1 kilometer south into the\nwoods, Funu was surprised to find an\nunusually large number of small animals\nin the woods. Feeasants, rabbits, road\ndeer, sheep, and the like. almost\neverywhere in groups or broods. This\namazed Fong Yu. Why are there so many\nsmall animals here? Fong Yu asked\ncuriously. I wish I had come here to\nhunt before. Olivia explained. Because\nthis place is close to the dragon's\nlair. It is within the dragons\nterritory. Larger carnivorous animals\ndare not set foot here. So, this place\nhas become a sanctuary for these weaker\ncreatures. Upon hearing this, Fong Yu\nsuddenly had a realization. To create a\nsafe and stable living environment for\nthe weak, one needs the strength of a\ndragon to deter predators. Therefore, if\none wants to create an environment where\nordinary people can live and work in\npeace, one must make one's strength like\nthat of a dragon, so that those enemies\nwho covet them dare not cross the line.\nAfter passing through this peaceful and\nserene animal paradise, Fong Yu and his\ntwo companions arrived at the foot of a\nrocky mountain. Looking up, the mountain\nwasn't very high, only about 300 m tall.\nIt was covered in yellowish brown rocks\nfrom top to bottom, and there was no\npath suitable for people to walk on. So,\nFong You could only cast wind dance on\nhimself and his two companions and fly\nup to the mountain side together. After\nflying halfway around the mountain side,\nFong Yu finally spotted a huge cave on\nthe southern side of the mountain. He\nthen controlled Wind Dance and landed in\nfront of the cave with his companions.\nThe cave entrance is very large, about\n40 m high, so it must be a dragon's\nlair. Honorable Dragon Odum, I have\narrived, Fong Yu called out into the\ncave. Before long, a foul wind blew out\nof the cave, and then a huge red dragon\nhead emerged from the shadows of the\ncave. The dragon Odum glanced at Fong\nYu, a hint of surprise flashing in his\namber-like eyes. he said in a deep\nvoice. Human, I didn't expect you to\nactually dare to come. Very good. I\nadmire your courage. You're too kind.\nFong Yu calmly waved his hand, and 20\nlarge, clean linen sheets appeared on\nthe ground. He then placed 20 roasted\nwhole pigs on the linen sheets one by\none, looked up at the giant dragon in\nfront of him, and smiled, saying, \"These\nare 20 cumin-flavored roasted pigs that\nI personally cooked for you. You can try\nthem and see if they suit your taste.\nChapter 153. The key to winning the bet.\nThe dragon glanced at the 20 roasted\npigs on the ground, lowered its massive\nhead to one of them, sniffed it, but\ndidn't eat it. Instead, it looked at\nFong Yu again, and asked, \"It smells\ngood, but why are there only 20, not\n100?\" Fong Yu smiled slightly and said,\n\"Because I think you can't eat 100 roast\npigs at once, and the taste of roast\npigs will not be good if they are left\nfor too long. So, I brought 20 this\ntime. If you like, I will send you five\nfreshly roasted pigs every day for the\nnext 5 days.\" Upon hearing Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s\nwords, the dragon narrowed its eyes\nslightly, silently scrutinized Fong Yu\nfor a while, and then nodded slightly.\nVery good, human. I thought you would\njust do a prefuncter job, but I didn't\nexpect you to be so dedicated. I'm\nstarting to look at you in a new light.\nLook at what you're saying. As a\nneighbor, it's been so long since I came\nto bring you some gifts. I'm sorry it\nwas my fault. I hope you don't mind. The\ndragon nodded again, then lowered its\nhead and bit into a roasted pig. After\nchewing twice, its eyes suddenly widened\nslightly, and it tilted its head back\nand swallowed it whole. Then it ate two\nmore roasted pigs. Hm. This is the first\ntime I've tasted this flavor. It's\nstrange, a bit stimulating, but very\ngood. I like it. After glancing at the\nremaining 17 roasted pigs, Odum said,\n\"For the sake of these roasted pigs, I\nwill not attack your city again, nor\nwill I attack the humans nearby. Thank\nyou for your kindness.\" Fongu nodded\nslightly to the dragon. I hope our\nrelationship can continue to be this\nharmonious, and it would be best if we\ncould take it a step further. This was\nalso another purpose of Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s\nvisit. Before he was certain that he\ncould kill the dragon without any chance\nof success, he wanted to try to win it\nover as an ally. If he could win it\nover, that would be the best outcome. If\nhe couldn't, he would have to find\nanother way. However, after hearing Fong\nYu&lt;unk&gt;s words, the dragon raised its\nhead and looked directly at Fong Yu,\nsaying, \"But as the spokesperson for the\nGod of Darkness, we have made a prior\nagreement that the dragon race has\nmaintained neutrality for thousands of\nyears and will not participate in the\nwager between the god of light and the\ngod of darkness. This is why our dragon\nrace has been able to live peacefully\nuntil now. So, don't expect me to help\nyou in any way.\" \"I understand.\" Fongu\nnodded but still asked with some\nreluctance. Then I want to ask if the\ngod of darkness loses this bet again.\nWill the god of light show leniency to\nyour dragon race when he purifies the\nentire world? The dragon Odum fell into\na long silence for it knew that the god\nof light's talk of purifying the world\nmeant erasing everything in the world\nand then rebuilding a new order. And the\ndragon race would certainly not be\nspared. In fact, Fong Yu already knew\nthe answer. He judged from the dragon's\nreaction that it also knew. So Fong, you\nsaid again. If your dragon race hadn't\nparticipated in the first nine bets, I\ncould understand since you could have\nsurvived for a while longer. But now\nthis is the last bet. If the dark god\nloses again, even if you remain neutral,\nyou won't escape being wiped out by the\nlight god. After hearing Fong use words,\nOdum sighed and said, \"Alas, you are\nright, humans. But even if we dragons\nparticipate in your bet, the outcome\nwill not change. Why? Because it was an\nunfair bet. Unfair? Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s eyes\nwidened in surprise and he asked, \"Why\ndo you say it's unfair? Because the\nprotagonist of these 10 bets are all you\nhumans, and selfishness and greed are\nracial vices buried deep in your human\nblood. So you can never establish true\npeace and order. So you will ultimately\nlose. To be honest, Fun Yu couldn't\nrefute the dragon's criticism because it\nwas true. Then why can't we try to build\na powerful army to rebel against this\nunfair wager? Why can't we try to defeat\nthe god of light? Hearing Fong use\nwords, the dragon sneered. Huh? Defeat\nthe god of light. The last person to say\nthat and do it is standing right next to\nyou. It is undeniable that she did build\nan unprecedentedly powerful army, but\nshe couldn't even defeat the angels\nunder the god of light. Not to mention,\nabove the angels are the titans, and\nthen the god of light. Fongu turned to\nlook at Olivia, who was silent to the\nside, and a look of shock flashed in his\neyes. Only then did he remember that\nOlivia had indeed said before that she\nhad once formed an undead army of\nmillions to fight against the gods. It\nturned out that she had gone to fight\nagainst the god of light. Human, you\nunderestimate the power of the god of\nlight. The dragon lowered its body and\nsaid in a deep voice before the supreme\ngod who wields the power of rules. We\nare not even ants but merely dust on the\nground. So put away your foolish and\nridiculous ideas. Fongu remained silent\nfor a long time, then raised his head\nand looked at the dragon with a\ndetermined gaze, saying, \"Instead of\nwaiting to be killed, why not take a\ngamble? Perhaps we really can defeat\nthose angels, titans, or even the god of\nlight. I've said it before, human, I\nadmire your courage. But now, this isn't\ncourage. It's arrogance. It's wishful\nthinking.\" Odum sneered. So, what do you\nplan to use to deal with the god of\nlight? Magic or martial arts? Or perhaps\nthe million strong undead army of the\noverlord? Fong Yu said firmly. But don't\nforget, I have the god of darkness\nbehind me, and he is also a supreme god.\nThe dark god. A hint of mockery flashed\nin Odum&lt;unk&gt;s eyes as he slowly said,\n\"Didn't the overlord tell you that the\ndark god's power has been exhausted, and\nhe is on the verge of falling?\" Seeing\nthat Fong, you remained silent. Odum's\namber-like eyes revealed a hint of\ncontempt as he said. The god of light\nknows everything about this world. What\nmakes you think you can fight him?\nOdum&lt;unk&gt;s words struck Fong Yu like a\nheavy blow. This world is no good. What\nabout things from another world? So Fong\nYu asked, \"Have you ever heard of atomic\nbombs, hydrogen bombs, or cobalt bombs?\nWhat did you say? What?\" The dragon was\nslightly taken aback. and space fleets,\ncarrier battle groups and orbital\ncannons, black hole bombs, and\nmechanical ascension. What is that? Odum\nasked, a look of confusion in his eyes.\nHe Fong Yu smiled slightly and said\nconfidently, \"These are things from\nanother world, things that the god of\nlight does not understand.\" It was only\nthen that Fong Yu finally realized why\nthe game system had brought players from\nanother world to this world to\nparticipate in this survival game and\nthe gamble of the gods. Because only\nplayers like themselves who came from\nanother world are beings that the god of\nlight cannot control. If I can research\nthese war weapons that the god of light\ncannot control through the players who\ntraveled with me, I will have a chance\nto defeat the gods and even defeat the\ngod of light. And this is the key to\nwinning this game of God. Chapter 154,\nthe second lord's meeting. After\nobtaining such important information\nfrom the dragon Odum, Fongu realized\nthat his previous thoughts and actions\nmight have been wrong. So he immediately\nbid farewell to the dragon, returned to\nthe manor with his companions, and\nlocked himself in his bedroom to start\nthinking. First, if you want to play\naccording to the rules of the wager of\nthe god of light, then you should\nsystematically eliminate the hostile\nplayer forces one by one, then unify all\n10 districts, establish a large kingdom,\nand then try to establish a stable\norder. But Funu knew that this process\nwas definitely not that simple. Judging\nfrom the game rules issued by the game\nsystem, it had been instigating\ncompetition between players and trying\nto intensify the conflicts between them.\nNow, it seemed that this was definitely\na huge trap. If our 100,000 players are\nreduced to very few due to internal\nstrife, then there will be no chance to\nrestore the original world's tech tree.\nIf we can only rely on the existing\npower of this world to develop, then it\nwill be impossible to defeat the god of\nlight, the main god of this world. As\nfor whether mortals can defeat gods,\nFongu has his own insights on this\nissue. As a novelist, I am familiar with\nmyths and deities from all over the\nworld. In fact, so-called gods are just\nbeings with power far exceeding that of\nmortals or some kind of advanced\ncivilization. Because this power could\nnot be understood by ordinary people at\nthe time, it was embellished by\nmissionaries and literature as some kind\nof supreme divine power. For example, if\nmodern humans returned to the stone age\nwith a complete technology tree, then in\nthe eyes of those primitive people,\nmodern humans who possess modern\ntechnology would be gods and modern\ntechnology would be a symbol of divine\npower in the eyes of primitive people.\nSo in the final analysis, the difference\nbetween them and the gods is simply the\ndifference in technological advancement.\nAs for what the dragon Odum said about\nthe god of light wielding the power of\nrules, anyone who has graduated from 9\nyears of compulsory education can\nunderstand that modern sciences such as\nphysics and chemistry are actually\nexplorations of the rules of the world.\nPerhaps their current scientific level\nis not yet at the level of the god of\nlight. But that does not mean they\ncannot catch up. Therefore, based on the\nabove deductions, Fongu decided that he\ncould not follow the predetermined path\nof this game. After all, the god of\nlight was the one who set the rules of\nthis game. And if he always followed the\nrules, he would never be able to defeat\nhim. Therefore, we can only find another\nway. Preserve the number of existing\nplayers as much as possible and then\ndiscover the talents among these players\nto study the technology of the original\nworld. Do you have a protos army? I have\nfighter jets and intercontinental\nballistic missiles. Let's see if your\nmagic is more powerful or my missiles.\nWhat's more, I have an undead legion and\nI can learn your magic. It's not too\nmuch to put exoskeletons on the warriors\nof the undead legion and equip them with\nVulcan gatling guns, is it? Imprinting\nstealth runes and wind-based speed runes\non airplanes and warships isn't too much\nto ask, is it? It wouldn't be too much\nfor me to send 10 nuclear bombs directly\nto your hometown using a teleportation\narray, would it? This is only the\ninitial stage. If we can unlock advanced\ntechnologies such as electromagnetic\nrail guns, laser cannons, and even\ncombat robots, it's not impossible to\nlaunch a counterattack against the god\nrealm. In short, as I said before, it's\nimpossible to let him be led by the nose\nby the rules of the game. And it's also\nimpossible to let him sit and wait for\nhis doom. Leun once said, \"Faced with a\npowerful opponent, even if you know you\nare no match, you must still draw your\nsword. Even if you fall, you must become\na mountain, a ridge. This is what is\nknown as the spirit of bright sword.\nAfter finalizing his plan, Fong Yu\nimmediately contacted Sanjuming, asking\nhim to act as the lord and add himself\nand all the other lords from other\ndistricts to a group chat, intending to\npersuade them to stop their pointless\ndisputes. Although he knew it would be\ndifficult to persuade those lords, he\nstill had to give it a try. So half an\nhour later, Sanjiming started a group\nchat as Fong Yu had requested. Lord of\nDistrict 6.\nFellow lords, let me introduce you to\nthe true leader of District 6, Fong Yu.\nLord of District 5, Arthur Stark. You\ndespicable bastards of District 6. You\nkilled over a thousand of my people in\none night. How do you intend to settle\nthis score? Lord of District 4, St. Paul\nLuther, in our districts, more than 500\nchildren of God. You will pay the price.\nLord of District 7, Tojo Village, you\nshameless bastards from District 6. You\nkilled nearly a thousand of my men,\nstole our women, and burned my\nterritory. I will never forgive you.\nLord of District 9, Adolf Bismar, Lord\nof District 8, Vladimir Viking, stop\nhiding in your own territory. Cowards,\ncome out and fight us. Lord of District\n10, Byron Tracha, Lord of District 8,\nVladimir Viking, get out here now. I\nchallenge you to a duel.\" Upon seeing\nthis, Fongu shook his head helplessly.\nHe realized that he had learned the news\ntoo late. His district 6 and district 8\nhad already formed a grudge with the\nother eight districts, and it would\nindeed be difficult to resolve the\nconflict. Compromise is definitely not\nan option. Anyone with a brain can guess\nthat those guys will demand a lot of\nbenefits and force him to sign a bunch\nof unequal treaties. Fongu would never\ndo such a thing. Therefore, the only\noption is to remain assertive to the\nend. Fongu then replied, \"Fong UID 6\nzone 0006.\nI gathered you here not to engage in\nempty talk, but to advise you to stop\nthese pointless fights. We should stop\nthe disputes and unite in cooperation.\"\nFong UID 606,\nthis is my advice to you. I advise you\nnot to be ungrateful. District 3 Lord\nGeorge Connor, you wretched\nyellow-skinned monkey. You are utterly\narrogant. Lord of District 9, Adolf\nBismar, Fong UID, District 60006.\nYou will pay the price for your\narrogance. Lord of District 2, Muhammad\nSharma, Fong UID. District 60006,\nMTF. I have never seen such a shameless\nperson. Lord of District 5, Arthur\nStark, I'll show you District 6 what\ncruelty truly means. Lord of District 7,\nTojo Village Lord, I will slaughter you\nall in District 6 to wash away my shame.\nThat's it. We can't continue the\nconversation. Fong Yu helplessly wiped\nhis face, forcibly suppressing his\nanger, and typed again, \"Fong UD\n6Zone00006.\nWe are all players who came here\ntogether. Our real enemy is not our own\npeople, but the mastermind behind this\ngame. I already know who the mastermind\nis. We should put aside our hatred,\nunite, and fight against that real\nenemy.\" Lord of District 7, Tojo\nVillage, Shameless. I will not believe\nyour lies. District 3 Lord George\nConnor. Wait, you say you know who's\nbehind this game? Tell me. Lord of\nDistrict 2, Muhammad Sharma. Tell me\nwhat you know. So Fong Yu told these\nlords the news he had heard from the\ndragon Odum. After reading Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s\nmessage about the wager between the god\nof light and the god of darkness, and\nthat this was the last of 10 wagers, the\nlords fell silent. Those who become\nlords are not fools. They actually have\ntheir own information channels. Although\nthey don't know as much detail as Fong\nYu, they can judge from the various\npieces of information they have obtained\nthat Fong Yu is probably not lying.\nDistrict 3 Lord George Connor. So you\nmean our real enemy is actually that god\nof light? Lord of District 2, Muhammad\nSharma, you mean we should stop the war,\nwork hard to advance technology, find a\nway to develop advanced weapons, and\nthen take down that god of light. Fong\nUID 60. That's right. That's what I\nthink. Lord of District 2, Muhammad\nSharma, we need to think about it. Lord\nof District 5, Arthur Stark, I also need\nto think about it. Then the group fell\nsilent again. At this moment, Fong Yu\nreceived a friend request from Viking\nEmperor. After Fong Yu accepted the\nrequest, Viking Emperor sent him a\nmessage. Lord of District 8, Vladimir\nViking, my friend, you're overlooking a\nvery serious problem. Even if these\npeople developed those advanced weapons,\ntheir first target will still be you and\nme. If I'm not mistaken, those eight are\nprobably plotting against us in another\nchat group. Lord of District 8, Vladimir\nViking, you underestimate people's\npursuit of power and status, and you\nunderestimate the darker side of human\nnature. Your ambitions will remain\nnothing but a pipe dream unless these\ndistricts are truly unified. Upon seeing\nthe Viking Emperor's message, Fong\nYu&lt;unk&gt;s heart sank. He knew the Viking\nEmperor was right. But this was also\nwithin his expectations. So he replied,\n\"Fong UID 66.\nI understand what you mean, but there is\na Chinese idiom that says courtesy first\nthen force.\" Fong Yu ID 6th District\n006. I convened this meeting not because\nI genuinely hope to peacefully unify all\nregions through this meeting. I simply\nwanted to tell them that if they persist\nin their ways and insist on causing\ntrouble again, I will swiftly and\ndecisively wipe them out. After a long\nsilence, the Viking Emperor on the other\nend sent a message. Lord of District 8,\nVladimir Viking, good luck. Chapter 155,\nA Cruel World. Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s words to\nthe Viking Emperor actually contain two\nlayers of meaning. The first layer of\nmeaning is that Fong Yu is expressing\nthat he has enough strength to fight\neight against one and sweep through the\nother eight areas which is showing off\nhis strength. The second layer of\nmeaning is that since I can sweep\nthrough the other eight regions, having\none more or one less of you won't make a\ndifference. This is a warning. As a\nleader himself, the Viking Emperor\nnaturally understood the two layers of\nmeaning in Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s words. So, he\nsent the message, \"Good luck.\" The\nmeaning of these four words is very\nambiguous. \"You could say he is\nsupporting Fong Yu, or you could say he\nwants to remain neutral. He's a seasoned\npolitician after all. His words are\nalways watertight,\" Fongu remarked.\nHowever, he wasn't too worried about\nanything happening to Viking Emperor.\nafter all for districts were watching\nhim and he had also swept through\ndistrict 7 yesterday relieving Viking of\nany worries. Viking emperor shouldn't\nhave the ability or reason to trip him\nup. Soon coincidentally the lords of the\nother eight districts finished thinking\ntogether and began to speak in the\ngroup. Lord of district 3, George Connor\nFong UID district 6006,\nI agree with your idea. We can cease\nhostilities, but the problem is that our\n10 districts are divided and governed\nseparately, and we are still a\ndisorganized mess. Therefore, I suggest\nelecting a leader to coordinate the\noverall actions of the 10 districts.\nLord of District 2, Muhammad Sharma. I\ncan also call a truce, but District 8\nneeds to compensate for the 253 of my\nsubjects who were killed yesterday. Lord\nof District 7, Tojo Village, Fong UID,\nDistrict 60006.\nI have no problem with a ceasefire, but\nyou must return all the women you stole\nfrom me and also pay me 1 million in\nresources. This will be used to offset\nthe losses from killing my men and\nburning my territory. Funu glanced\naround and saw that almost all the lords\nwere talking about the word\ncompensation. It seemed that this was\nthe plan they had secretly devised. If I\nagree to pay compensation, these guys\nwill definitely demand an exorbitant\nprice and leave me with nothing. But if\nI don't agree to pay compensation, they\ncan occupy the moral high ground and\nunite to punish me again. What a clever\nscheme, Fong Yu replied with a cold\nlaugh. Fong UID 6006.\nDon't try anything funny. You should\nknow very well why I killed your people.\nI was acting in self-defense. Fong UID 6\nzone 0006. Of course, I am also very\nclear that in this world there is no law\nthat can measure and adjudicate to\ndetermine who is right and who is wrong.\nThe only one qualified to make a\njudgment is the one with the biggest\nfist. Fong UID 66.\nI've already told you what I needed to\nsay and I've told you who the real enemy\nis. If you still want to stir up\ntrouble, then I won't be polite to you\nanymore. As soon as Fong Yu finished\nspeaking, the lords in the group chat\nbegan to hurl insults and accusations at\nhim, calling him an evil person, a\ndictator, and someone who should go to\nhell and so on. Fu was too lazy to\nlisten to these guys babbling anymore.\nSo he directly asked Song Jimming to\ndisband the chat group and gave him an\nimportant task. We are secretly\nrecruiting scientific research talents\nin all 10 districts. Anyone who meets\nthe criteria will be directly rewarded\nwith 10,000 resources exempted from all\nlabor tasks and will enjoy an\nindependent house in King's Landing. All\ntheir food, clothing, and daily\nnecessities will be provided to the\nhighest standard. A substantial reward\nwill be given for providing research\nfindings or blueprints with practical\nvalue. Unfortunately, blueprints for\nthis game are extremely difficult to\nobtain, especially technology related\nblueprints, which are incredibly rare.\nTo quickly advance in technology, the\nonly option is to rely on players in the\noriginal world to conduct their own\nresearch. While Fongu was arranging\ninternal affairs on the other side, St.\nPaul Luther, the Lord of District 4, was\nsitting in the huge wooden house of the\nLord of District 5, deep in thought.\nBeside him, kneeling, was a man, Arthur\nStark, the Lord of District 5. Yes,\nthrough his special skill, the gift of\nholy light, St. Paul has already\nspiritually enslaved the lords of\nDistrict 5. Arthur, is there anything\nyou want to say? St. Paul asked, looking\ndown. Arthur Stark slowly raised his\nhead and replied in a devout tone. In\nresponse to master's question, judging\nfrom what Fong Yu said in the group just\nnow, I believe he should be the\nspokesperson for the dark god. \"So, what\nshould we do?\" Sao Paulo asked again. A\nmurderous glint flashed in Arthur's eyes\nas he coldly said, \"I'll go back\nimmediately, lead all the troops, and\nkill that guy in district 6 at all\ncosts.\" \"No, no, no.\" St. Paul waved his\nhand and smiled. \"That would be a bit\ntoo hasty. Besides, with just the few\npeople in your district 5, it would be\ndifficult to defeat Fongu. You know, he\nalso has a considerable number of undead\ntroops. Then what should we do, master?\nArthur asked, puzzled. St. Paul bent\ndown, gently patted Arthur's head, and\nlaughed. It's simple. Just call more\npeople together. But will the lords of\nthe other regions agree? Arthur asked,\npuzzled. After all, they haven't\nreceived your blessing and bast in your\nholy light. Don't worry. As long as you\noffer them enough benefits, they will\nnaturally agree. What do you mean? Let's\nlaunch an attack on Fong Yu in district\n6 in the name of revenge and invite the\nlords of the other districts to join the\nbattle. After the battle, we will take\nnothing from district 6 and divide all\nthe spoils and prisoners among the\nparticipating lords. What do you think\nof this method? Arthur Stark suddenly\nrealized. I think they have no reason to\nrefuse. On the other hand, after\narranging the internal affairs of\nKing&lt;unk&gt;s Landing, Fong Yu began to\ndeal with his own internal affairs.\nThrough yesterday's battles, Fong\nYu&lt;unk&gt;s honor points increased by 4352.\nBased on the calculation that he gains\ntwo honor points for each person killed\nfrom outside the region, he killed more\nthan 2,000 people in total. When Fong Yu\ncalculated this number, he was slightly\nstunned, and a strange and enormous\nemotion suddenly rose from the bottom of\nhis heart. He stood there dumbfounded.\nHe actually killed more than 2,000\npeople in a single day. Although he knew\nthat almost all of these people were\nkilled by the zombie army, and only a\nfew were actually killed by him, the\nplayers who died at the hands of the\nzombies would still be blamed on him. He\nnow commands an army of nearly a\nthousand zombies. If he wanted, he could\nsend Olivia back to the dense forest and\nmilitary camp in District 7 to resurrect\nthe corpses he killed last night,\nbringing the zombie army to 2,000 and\nthen sweep through the other districts.\nBut if that's the case, how many people\nwill survive out of all 10 districts? Is\nthere still any chance for me to realize\nmy dream of advancing in technology?\nFeeling incredibly stifled, he left the\nwooden house and went into the yard,\nhoping to soothe the lingering emotions\nwithin him. Looking at the lush green\nforest around him, and feeling the bird\nsong and fragrance of flowers flowing\nthrough the woods, Fong Yu felt better.\nHe gradually understood what the\ninexplicable emotion in his heart was.\nIt was an immense, suffocating sense of\nguilt. A small sense of guilt can only\nmake one's heart tremble. It's like when\nyou were a child and you stole your\ndeskmate's eraser and got caught. You\nwould only feel a slight tremor in your\nheart and then you would say sorry with\na grin. But the guilt of killing more\nthan 2,000 people in a single day is\nenough to overwhelm an ordinary person's\nspirit and will. But Fongu knew that his\nspirit and consciousness could not\ncollapse. He still had many things to\ndo. He had to cut off these useless\nemotions and make himself cold. Only by\nbeing cold enough could he face this\nextremely cruel world. Chapter 156. The\nseeds of the tree of life. After\nwandering around the courtyard for half\nan hour, Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s sense of guilt\ngradually dissipated. At the same time,\nhe was thinking about whether there was\nany way to minimize casualties while\nsubduing those eight, no, those nine\nareas. Just then, Funu arrived at the\ncemetery. He glanced at the black statue\nof the goddess of life and death in the\ncenter of the cemetery and then at the\n10 tombstones. One of the tombstones had\nSong Jimming&lt;unk&gt;s name engraved on it.\nSuddenly, a brilliant idea flashed in\nFong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s mind. If he could capture\nall the lords of the other nine\ndistricts, kill them, and then use this\ngraveyard to resurrect the undead loyal\nto him, wouldn't this conflict between\nthe districts be easily resolved? Upon\nrealizing this, Fong Yu was overjoyed.\nThis method is undoubtedly the idea that\nbest suits his wishes at the moment. He\nonly needs to kill these few people to\npeacefully unify all 10 regions. Fu\nremembered a saying that went something\nlike this on the internet. If you can't\nsolve the problem, then solve the person\nwho raised the problem. The current\nconflict between the districts is\nactually caused by the lords of those\ndistricts. Anyone who has studied\nhistory knows that since ancient times,\nno war has ever been without the service\nof politics. The reason why those lords\nwant to provoke conflict between the\ndistricts is simply to achieve their own\npolitical goals. Moreover, if we simply\neliminate those few lords, new lords\nwill emerge to cause trouble. The best\nsolution is to enslave those lords and\nmake them our own, thus eliminating the\nroot of all conflict. So Fu began to\nthink about how to carry out his plan to\nswitch the prince with a cat. In fact,\nthis plan is similar to a decapitation\noperation. All I need to do is\ninfiltrate the lord's side, kidnap him,\ntake him back to the manor, and then\nresurrect him using the undead\ngraveyard. With my current strength, if\nI were to bring along Alpha, Olivia, and\nValentina as companions and take\nadvantage of the night, it shouldn't be\ntoo difficult. Therefore, Fong Yu\ndecided to test the waters with the\nseventh district lord tonight. After\nall, he was the one who shouted the\nloudest in the group chat just now. If\nhe doesn't take him down first, who else\nshould he take down, right? After making\nup his mind, Fongu felt much better. He\nreturned to the cabin and continued to\nstudy the lottery. Based on the rule\nthat every 10 honor points can be used\nto draw a prize once, Fong Yu could draw\na total of 435 times. So he summoned the\nlottery wheel and prepared to draw a\nprize. After the tentacle monster\nappeared, it shook its tentacles and\ngreeted Fong Yu. After all, he was a\nregular customer. Last time you said the\nartifacts were sold out. What about this\ntime? Fong Yu asked the tentacle\nmonster. This was the question he was\nmost concerned about. The tentacle\nmonster shook its head and held up a\nsign. I haven't had time to go back and\nrestock yet. Damn it. What are you doing\nhere if you haven't restocked? Fongu\nrolled his eyes and said, \"Forget it.\nI'm not drawing anymore. I'll draw after\nyou restock.\" At this moment, the\ntentacle monster held up another sign.\n\"It will take a long time to get back\nafter going back, so you can use some of\nyour lottery chances first.\" Fongu\nraised an eyebrow after reading it,\nthinking that made sense. Anyway, even\nif he restocked, he would only have a\nfew artifacts at most, and a few chances\nto win the lottery would be enough. So,\nhe might as well use up some chances to\nwin the lottery first. Since there was\nvery little roasted meat left, Fong Yu\nsimply carried the entire carcass of a\nwild boar to feed the tentacle monster\non the roulette wheel. After the\ntentacle monster was full, Fong Yu\nselected the resource prize option and\nstarted the 10 draw mode. He now needs a\nlot of resources to upgrade his manor,\nand the construction of King's Landing\nalso requires a lot of building\nmaterials. After using 30 10 draws, Fong\nYu obtained a total of over 400,000\nworth of various low to mid-level\nbuilding materials. Of course, these are\nsecondary. The important thing is that I\nalso obtained an orange legendary level\ntree of life seed, a purple epic level\nwater dragon heart, and a purple epic\nlevel fire dragon heart. Seed of the\ntree of life. Orange legend, the tree of\nlife, is a powerful being created by the\ngoddess of life. It can connect with all\nplants in nature and upon maturity it\ncan absorb energy from nature to give\nbirth to nature spirits. Nature spirits\nare the ancestors of the elf race and\nall elves evolved from them. Heart of\nthe water dragon. Purple epic the heart\nof a powerful water dragon used to craft\nepic and even legendary equipment.\nAbsorbing its water dragon power\nincreases maximum stamina by 100 and\ngrants the passive talent skill breath\nof water. Water breathing passive. Upon\nentering a body of water, the water\nbreathing spell is automatically cast,\nallowing the user to breathe oxygen from\nthe water. This consumes one point of\nmana per minute. Heart of the fire\ndragon. Purple epic, the heart of a\npowerful fire dragon used to craft epic\nor even legendary equipment. It can also\nabsorb the dragon's power to increase\nthe power of fire magic by 20% and grant\nthe talent skill. Fire dragon scales.\nFire dragon scale armor consumes 100\nmana points. After releasing fire dragon\nscale armor, the entire body will be\ncovered with a layer of fire dragon\nscales, increasing strength by 30%,\ngreatly increasing fire resistance and\nslightly increasing resistance to other\nattributes. lasts for 10 minutes with a\n1-hour cool down. Dot. Although not a\ndivine artifact, the two dragon hearts\nare still extremely effective. The water\ndragon heart increases one's maximum\nstamina by 100, which is equivalent to\ngiving oneself an extra life, while the\nfire dragon heart not only increases\nfire magic damage, but also adds a\nprotective scale armor skill. No wonder\nit's an epic treasure. As for the seed\nof this tree of life, it's even more\namazing. It can actually give birth to\nelves after it matures. Just then,\nValentina suddenly opened Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s\nbedroom door and said excitedly,\n\"Master, I can sense the aura of the\ntree of life.\" Then, Valentina saw the\nwalnut-sized seed of the tree of life in\nFong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s hand, which was radiating\nmulticolored light, and her beautiful\neyes widened in surprise. \"The seed of\nthe tree of life!\" Valentina shouted\nexcitedly and rushed to Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s\nside, saying excitedly, \"Master, you\nactually obtained the seed of the tree\nof life.\" As she said this, two lines of\ntears appeared on Valentina's face.\nSeeing Valentina's outburst, Fong Yu\nasked, bewildered, \"Do you like this? If\nyou do, it's&lt;unk&gt; yours.\" As he spoke,\nFong Yu handed the seeds to Valentina.\nValentina glanced at Fongu carefully\nused her mental power to hold the seed\nand said with a sob, \"I thought the elf\nrace had become dust of history.\" \"I\nnever thought that I could see the tree\nof life again. With this seed, the elf\nrace can come back to this world.\"\nSeeing Valentina's excitement, Fong Yu\nasked curiously, \"Is the elf race\nimportant to you?\" At this moment,\nOlivia came to the bedroom door and said\nto Fong Yu, \"Valentina was once the\nqueen of the elves. What is that? The\nelf queen. At this moment, Valentina\nnodded, her expression slightly somber,\nand sighed. Alas, it's&lt;unk&gt; all because\nof me that the elven race has met its\ndemise. Upon hearing this, Fongu could\nroughly guess that Valentina and the\nelves must have a tragic past, probably\nrelated to the gods gamble. Although\nFong Yu was very curious about that\nstory, he knew that now was not the time\nto reopen Valentina's wounds, so he\ncomforted her. All right, let's not\nthink about the past. Now that we have\nthis seed, we can grow the tree of life\nagain and your elven race can return,\nright? Upon hearing this, Valentino\nwiped away the tears on her cheeks,\nsmiled, and nodded, saying, \"Thank you,\nmaster, for giving me the opportunity to\natone for the sins of the elf race.\"\nGhost Valentina's trust level plus 400.\nGhost Valentina's current trust level,\n715. Her relationship with you has\nupgraded from trust to respect. Chapter\n157. The resurrected female warrior.\nSonata Sari. My favorability rating\nincreased by 200. Upon seeing the system\nnotification, Fong Yu smiled helplessly.\nThis wasn't something he had created on\npurpose. It was something he had won in\na lottery. However, he really didn't\nexpect that this seemingly gentle and\ndelicate girl was actually the queen of\nthe elves. By the way, Tina, do elves\nand humans look the same? Fun Yu asked\ncuriously because after spending so much\ntime with Valentina, he really couldn't\ntell the difference between her and a\nhuman. Valentino wiped away her tears\nand replied with a smile. The elves can\nuse elven magic to change their bodies\nat will. They can become tree people,\ngiant bears, cheetahs, or even ravens\nand eagles. However, we usually shape\nour main body into the appearance of\nhumans, or more accurately, the\nappearance of gods. Gods? Funu asked\nsomewhat surprised. Valentina explained,\n\"Yes, it's not that we are like humans,\nbut that humans are like gods. When the\ntitans created humans, they created them\nin their own image. And in their own\nimage, the Supreme God created them in\nhis own image. It feels like a nested\ndoll.\" Fong Yu raised an eyebrow and\nsaid, \"And who did the Supreme God's\nappearance resemble?\" Valentina covered\nher mouth and chuckled. \"I guess only\nthe Supreme God himself knows the answer\nto this question.\" \"All right, all\nright, that's enough. Take a look and\nsee where this seed is suitable to plant\nand whether it needs anything else to\nhelp it grow,\" Fongu said. Valentina\nthought for a moment and replied, \"The\ntree of life can grow anywhere. But if\nit grows naturally, it takes a thousand\nyears to mature. If you want to\naccelerate its maturity, you need to\ninscribe a spirit gathering magic circle\nto provide a large supply of magic\npower. Magic supply. H magic crystals\nwould be best.\" Upon hearing about magic\ncrystals, Funu immediately perked up. He\nhad just extracted over 3,000 magic\ncrystals. So, he said to Valentina, \"I\nhave over 3,000 magic crystals here. Is\nthat enough for it to mature?\" Upon\nhearing this, Valentina exclaimed with\ndelight, \"3,000 magic crystals should be\nenough to make it mature in about 30\nyears.\" Within 30 years. Although Fong\nYu knew that a year in this world only\nhad 12 days, 30 years would still have\n360 days. It's been a while. However,\nFongu remembered that the treasure vault\nin the underground palace seemed to\ncontain a lot of magic crystals. So, it\nseemed he would have to find an\nopportunity to go back to that\nunderground palace again. Fong Yu then\nplaced 3,000 magic crystals in the\ncellar, allowing Valentina to take them\nwhenever she needed them. Valentina,\nmeanwhile, took the seed of the tree of\nlife and ran out of the house to search\nfor a suitable planting location. Out of\ncuriosity, Fongu followed. Ultimately,\nValentina chose to plant the seed of the\ntree of life in the forest to the south.\nAfter the seed was planted, Valentina\nplaced six magic crystals next to it and\nbegan chanting a spell. Soon, the six\nmagic crystals connected to form a\nsix-pointed star magic circle. And then,\na continuous stream of magic power began\nto flow into the seed in the center of\nthe magic circle. In less than a minute,\na green sprout shimmering with a bright\ngreen light emerged from the soil and\nslowly grew into a 30cm tall sapling at\na speed visible to the naked eye. This\nsapling has three branches. The middle\none is thicker and the two side branches\nare thinner, making it look like a small\ntree person. Just as Fong Yu was\ncarefully observing the sapling,\nsuddenly the sapling trembled slightly.\nAnd after its three branches bent\nslightly, it stretched out again as if\nit had stretched. In an instant, the\nentire forest began to sway, and the\nsurrounding giant trees began to\ntremble. What's going on? Fongu\nnervously pulled out his wand. He was\nall too familiar with this situation.\nWhy have all the trees around us turned\ninto tree people? Valentina smiled\nslightly and explained, \"Master, there's\nno need to be nervous. The tree of life\nis the master of all plants, and its\nappearance will make all plants bow down\nto it. Upon hearing this, Funu breathed\na sigh of relief and turned to look\naround again. Sure enough, the giant\ntrees that had become tree people bowed\ndown to the tender bud of the tree of\nlife in submission, and even the grass\non the ground bowed down to the bud. At\nthis moment, Valentina said to Fong Yu,\n\"When the tree of life grows, even the\nwill of the forest will become a part of\nit, and it will radiate endless life\nforce to repair this lost land, and the\nelves will return to this world.\" Fongu\nlooked at Valentina, whose face was\nbeaming with joy, and smiled slightly as\nwell. He saw a light in Valentina's eyes\nhe had never seen before, which made him\nfeel gratified because he had finally\nhelped his friend regain her hope for\nlife. After the tree of life was\nplanted, Fong Yu asked Valentina if she\nwanted to send some zombie troops to\nguard it. Valentina smiled and shook her\nhead, saying, \"I will be here tonight to\nprotect it and replace the magic\ncrystals in the magic circle.\" The\ntrance around here will also guard it,\nso there shouldn't be any problems.\nDon't worry. Fongu was slightly taken\naback when he heard that Valentina was\nalso going to stay here to protect him.\nIn that case, the decapitation operation\ntonight would be one less partner.\nHowever, with Olivia and Alfa on the\nteam, there shouldn't be too much of a\nproblem. Moreover, his own combat\nabilities have actually improved\nsignificantly after this period of\ntraining. So, Fongu didn't say anything\nmore. After telling Valentina about the\ndecapitation operation that night, he\nreturned to the manor. Before parting,\nValentina gave a final word of advice.\nMaster, please be very careful. Don't\nworry. Upon returning to the manor, Fong\nYu instructed Olivia to bring the female\nwarrior zombie back to the manor and\nplace her in a coffin in the cemetery,\nintending to turn her into an undead. He\nneeded to use this female warrior for\nhis upcoming plans. I wonder if zombies\ncan become undead. Soon, the cemetery\nprovided the answer. The coffin\ncontaining the female warrior slowly\nsank into the soil and the goddess\nstatue in the center of the cemetery\nemitted a green light onto the coffin. A\nmoment later, the coffin lid was pushed\nopen from the inside and the female\nwarriors sat up from the coffin, looking\naround in confusion. Welcome. Fongu\nglanced at the name on the tombstone and\nsmiled. Sonata Sari. Upon hearing this,\nthe female warrior turned to look at\nFong Yu, her eyes first flashing with\nanger. She recognized him as the\nmastermind behind the attack on Han Ko\nby leading the monster army. Baka, you\nwretched fellow. The female warrior\ninstinctively reached for the sword at\nher waist, but found nothing.\nImmediately afterwards, a green light\nflashed across her body, and then the\nfemale warrior fell into a daz as if\nreceiving some information. A moment\nlater, the female warrior climbed out of\nthe coffin and reluctantly asked Fong\nYu, \"So, I've become an undead, and\nyou're now my master?\" Fongu shrugged\nand said, \"I'm sorry for killing you\nbefore, but we were enemies back then.\nNow that I've resurrected you, we're\neven.\" Sonata Sari bit her lip, her\nexpression conflicted, and asked, \"Then\nwhy did you revive me? Don't you want to\nbe resurrected?\" Fongu smiled and said,\n\"If you die, you lose everything.\"\nSonata Sauri replied calmly, \"For a\nwarrior, dying on the battlefield is\nactually the highest honor.\" Upon\nhearing this, Fongu raised an eyebrow\nand instantly held the female warrior in\nhigher regard. Even Olivia, who was\nstanding next to him, couldn't help but\ntake a second look at her. After\nthinking for a moment, Fongu replied, I\nagree with your point of view. But there\nis an old Chinese saying, \"Death is\ninevitable for everyone, but it can be\nas weighty as Mount Thai or as light as\na feather. So, do you think your death\nis as weighty as Mount Thai or as light\nas a feather?\" Looking at the silent\nsonata sour, Fongu laughed again. I know\nyou're doing this to protect your\nvillage, but you followed the wrong\nperson. I've heard some things from the\nwomen in Han Ko. The men in Tojo\nvillage, including most of the men in\nHan Kio, don't treat you women like\nhuman beings at all. They treat you like\nlivestock. Do you think it's worth\nrisking your life for those kinds of\npeople and dying in the end? Then what's\nthe difference between you and them?\nSonata Sari stared at Fong Yu and asked,\n\"Aren't all men the same? Power and\nwomen, aren't they always the things you\nchase after?\" Fong Yu raised an eyebrow\nand shook his head, saying, \"I'm\ndifferent from them. I respect women\nvery much. All women in District 6 enjoy\nthe same rights as men. If you don't\nbelieve me, you can contact the female\ncompatriots who transferred to District\n6 and asked them how they've been doing\nlately.\" It was obvious that Sonata\nSauri didn't completely trust Fong\nYu&lt;unk&gt;s words. She actually opened the\nchat system and asked some of the female\ncompatriots who had transferred over\nfrom other regions. A moment later,\nSonata Sauri closed the chat system and\nher gaze towards Fong Yu finally\nsoftened. It seems you weren't lying.\nYou really are different from them. Upon\nhearing this, Fong Yu smiled again, then\nhanded her his personal sword and said,\n\"So, are you now willing to be my\nsubordinate?\" Sonata Sarari took the\nkatana, solemnly assumed a fighting\nstance, and said, \"If you want me to\nwillingly acknowledge you as my master,\nyou must first defeat the sword in my\nhand.\" Seeing this, Olivia reached back\nand took the ax from her back, intending\nto step forward, but Fongu stopped her.\nHe That's fine, too. Fong Yu took out\nthe black gold ancient sword he won in\nthe lottery from his storage ring and\nsaid to Olivia, \"I always lose when we\nspar. Now I can finally have a different\nsparring partner. Let me regain my\nconfidence. Upon hearing this, Olivia\nhad no choice but to step aside. Then\nFong Yu twirled his sword and said to\nSonata Sauri, who was already in a\nfighting stance, \"Let's&lt;unk&gt; begin.\"\nUpon hearing this, the female warrior\nshouted and raised her katana to slash\nat Fong Yu. Seeing this, Fongu swung his\nsword upwards to parry the katana that\nwas slashing at him. After a clang of\nmetal on metal, the katana in the female\nwarrior's hand was deflected. A look of\nsurprise flashed in Sonata Sar's eyes.\nShe hadn't expected that Fong Yu, who\nlooked so frail, would have such\nstrength and could so easily deflect her\nknife. Fong Yu seized the opportunity to\nstep forward, swung his blade, and\nslashed at the female warrior's side\nwaist, forcing her to draw her sword and\nblock in front of her waist. However,\nFong Yu's slash was just a faint. His\nreal attack was an elbow strike after\nclosing in, which landed heavily on\nSonata Sari's unprotected chest. Fong\nYu's strength is now close to 10, which\nis close to the peak of an ordinary\nhuman. This attack is enough to break\nthe ribs and seriously injure an\nordinary person. However, Sonata Saari\nhad already become an undead, and her\nphysique had been greatly enhanced. Fong\nYu&lt;unk&gt;s attack only made her body pause\nfor a moment before she raised her sword\nand slashed down towards Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s\ngroin. Upon seeing this, Fong Yu\nfrowned, withdrew his hand, pressed down\non the back of the black gold ancient\nsword, and slashed downwards,\nsuccessfully blocking the opponent's\ninsidious attack. He also used the force\nfrom Sonata Sari's weapon to retreat\nbackwards. Tsk tisk. Funu shook his head\nand said, \"Your move is a bit ruthless.\"\nSonata Sauri, expressionless, raised her\nhand to straighten her slightly loosened\ncollar and replied, \"Your attack was\nshameless, too.\" Fongu smiled\nhelplessly. He attacked Sonata Sauri's\nchest because she was completely\nunprotected and not for any other\nreason. But now it seems that Sonata\nSari has misunderstood him. However,\nFongu was too lazy to explain and\ncharged at Sonata Saari again with his\nsword. Having just exchanged blows,\nSonata Sari no longer dared to\nunderestimate Fongu. She carefully\nobserved Fong use every move, trying to\nfind his weakness. But Fongu was too\nfast. In the blink of an eye, he was\nclose to Sonata Sari again. He did a\nside slash and then followed up with a\njumping slash. Sonata Sari dodged Fong\nuse horizontal slash by stepping back,\nbut the range of the jumping slash was\ntoo large to avoid, so she was forced to\nraise her sword to take the hit. Bite.\nAfter a crisp sound, Sonata Sari looked\nin surprise at the katana in her hand\nthat had broken in. At the same time,\nthe blade of Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s black gold\nancient sword hovered above Sonata\nSari&lt;unk&gt;s head. So, are you convinced\nor not? Fongu smiled faintly and she his\nblade. You are much more capable than I\nimagined. Sonata Sari said calmly. But I\nonly lost because of my weapon. He Fong\nYu shrugged and said, \"Weapons and\nequipment are also part of strength. A\nreal enemy will not give you a fair\nchance to fight.\" After a moment of\nsilence, Sonatasari nodded and said,\n\"You're right. I lost.\" Seeing that\nSonata Sasari had truly admitted defeat,\nFongu laughed and said, \"All right, it\nwas just a small match. Don't take it to\nheart. You have no idea how badly I was\nbeaten by her during our sparring\nsessions these past few days. As he\nspoke, Fong Yu pointed to Olivia\nstanding to the side. Sonata Sauri\nturned to look at Olivia, frowned, and\nsaid coldly, \"One day, I will defeat you\nto avenge the death of me.\" Upon hearing\nthis, Olivia calmly nodded and said,\n\"Okay, I'll wait.\" At this moment,\nSonata Sari gently rubbed her chest and\nasked curiously, \"Strange! Why can't I\nfeel any pain?\" Olivia explained,\n\"That's just how the undead are. They\nlose the ability to feel pain, and their\ninjuries heal quickly, which is an\nadvantage for warriors.\" \"All right, all\nright, you can talk about the details of\nthe undead on the way,\" Fongu\ninterrupted. \"It's getting late. We\nshould set off.\" \"Where to?\" Sonatasari\nasked. Go to hell with Hong Ko. Chapter\n158. Disguised entry into Hano. Although\nthis was a secret decapitation\noperation, as a precaution, Fong Yu\nstill brought 500 zombie soldiers to the\ndense forest outside Hono, where the\nzombies were responsible for providing\nsupport in case of any accidents. Funu\nhas always preferred to play it safe and\ndo his best to avoid any unexpected\nsetbacks. After all, you only have one\nlife. Even if you die and are\nresurrected as an undead, you only have\ntwo, so cherish every moment. On the way\nhere, Fong Yu also told Sonata Sarari\nabout his plan to capture the village of\nTojo and turn them into immortals so\nthat they could peacefully annex\ndistrict 7. He had expected to have to\nuse a lot of persuasion to convince\nSonatasari to help him with this favor.\nBut before he could even begin,\nSonatasari nodded and said, \"I'm willing\nto help kill Tojo Mirosa.\" This this\ncompletely stumped Fong Yu. Do you have\nsome personal grudge against him? Fong\nYu asked curiously. Upon hearing this,\nSonata Sari nodded and gritted her teeth\nangrily, saying, \"I actually hate that\nbastard, too, because he treats women as\nplay things. Every night, he invites\nmany women into his house to keep him\nand his subordinates company. Several\nwomen have even died in his house,\nincluding one of my good sisters. If it\nweren't for my swordsmanship making him\nwary, and if he hadn't needed my help,\nand thus refrained from using force, I\nwouldn't have escaped death either. I\nsee, Fongu said, suddenly understanding.\nSonata Sari added, \"You must be careful\nwhen dealing with Tojo. His ability is\nvery strange. He can sneak in the\nshadows.\" \"Shadows? Stealth?\" Fongu\nfrowned. He had heard of this technique\nbefore. It seemed to be a ninja's\nability or perhaps a skill of a\nprofessional stalker in this world.\nAnyway, it's quite troublesome to deal\nwith, especially since it's nighttime\nnow and there are shadows everywhere.\nNot only is it easy to be ambushed, but\nhe might also use this skill to escape.\nTherefore, we need to think in advance\nabout how to deal with his ability. A\nmoment later, everything was ready and\nFongu took out the Faceless One mask and\nput it on his face. Please select the\nappearance you wish to change. So Fong\nYu followed the order and found the name\nof the last Japanese man he killed, Od\nShinbe. He changed his appearance, then\ntook out a samurai outfit he had taken\nfrom the backpack of the corpse in Han\nKio, and put it on. Finally, he tied the\nkatana Mayo Murram Mesa, which had been\npurified by Valentina, to his waist. How\nis it? Isn't it exactly the same as the\nguy we killed yesterday? Fongu turned to\nOlivia and asked. Olivia looked her up\nand down before nodding. Fong Yu then\nasked Sonata Sarari, \"What do you\nthink?\" After looking at her carefully,\nSonata Sari replied, \"Your appearance\nand clothing are the same, but you are\ntaller and your temperament is quite\ndifferent.\" Ora, how is it different?\nYour expression is too bland. It should\nbe more fierce, and your mouth should\ndroop down a bit more. Like the kind of\nexpression that makes everyone look like\nthey owe you a lot of money. H is that\nabout right? Yes, that's it. Immediately\nafterwards, Fong Yu pulled out more than\na dozen female zombies who had been\nresurrected in Han Ko from the zombie\narmy and had them stand beside him.\nLooking at it this way, it really did\nlook like a Japanese army. Once we get\nto their territory, we'll try to\ninfiltrate. If that fails, we'll say we\nescaped from the enemy and blending in\nwith these disguises, Fong Yu said to\nSonata Sari. I don't understand your\ngrammar, so automatic translation might\ncause problems. We'll have to rely on\nyou for communication. The female\nwarrior nodded. At this point, Olivia\nasked. And what about me? Fongu took out\na piece of hemp rope and said with a\nsmile, you can pretend to be a hostage\nI've captured. A moment later, Olivia\nglanced at the knots tied around her\nbody and asked in confusion, \"Master,\nwhy are they so complicated?\" Fongu\nsmiled meaningfully and said, \"You don't\nunderstand. This is a unique knot they\nuse to bind prisoners, especially female\nprisoners. They have to be tied like\nthis. It took me a long time to learn\nit. A moment later, Fong Yu and his\ngroup emerged from the dense forest and\nheaded towards Hano. Although Fong Yu\nburned down most of the houses in Hano\nyesterday, they have now been largely\nrepaired. The wooden walls have even\nbeen reinforced for more arrow towers\nhave been added and several patrol teams\nare patrolling the walls. It's clear\nthat Tojo Village was terrified of being\nambushed, so they've increased their\nvigilance, making it unlikely that\nanyone could sneak in. Sure enough, as\nFong Yu and his group approached the\ngates of Han Ko, the archers on the\narrow tower spotted them and immediately\nbegan shouting. Soon, the patrolman on\nthe wall gathered at the gate, drew\ntheir bows, and aimed at Fong Yu and his\ngroup. At that moment, Sonata Sari\nstepped forward and announced loudly,\n\"It's me and Odinbe too. We're back.\"\nThese words immediately caused a stir\namong the people on the wall. A moment\nlater, the village gate opened a crack\nand three male warriors walked out from\nthe crack and came to Fong Yu and the\nothers. After seeing Sonata Sauri and\nFong Yu in disguise, they looked at the\ndozen or so female zombies behind them\nand confirmed that they were indeed from\nthe village. The leading male warrior\nvisibly breathed a sigh of relief and\nsaid, \"That's great. I thought you were\nall dead.\" Sonata Sari said, \"No, we\nwere just captured yesterday, but we\nmanaged to escape tonight.\" At this\nmoment, one of the male warriors noticed\nOlivia, who was the tallest in the\ncrowd. He was slightly taken aback when\nhe saw the ropes binding her. And then\nupon seeing Olivia's stunning figure and\nnear-perfect face, he gasped and asked\nin a days, \"Who is she?\" \"She was a\nhostage we captured on our way back,\"\nSonatasari explained. \"And she seems to\nbe a guard of the sixth district lord,\nso she should know a lot of secrets\nabout the Sixth District. Therefore, we\nplan to take her to see Lord Tojo.\" The\nmale warrior was about to say something\nmore when Fongu frowned, snorted coldly,\nand touched the hilt of his sword at his\nwaist. Seeing that Oda Shin sama seemed\nabout to get angry and remembering that\nhis cursed sword consumed human blood\neveryday, the male samurai shrank back,\nbowed respectfully and replied, \"Yes,\nsir.\" Then led by the three male\nwarriors, Fong Yu and his group entered\nthe village gate and walked towards a\nnewly built large house in the center of\nthe village. It was already late at\nnight and everyone in the village except\nthe patrolman had returned to their\nhouses. So there were no unexpected\nincidents along the way. As soon as\neveryone arrived at the door of the\nhouse, Fongu heard some strange noises\ncoming from inside. The two samurai\nguarding the gate glanced at the\napproaching crowd. When they saw the\nthree leading samurai, they were about\nto ask something. But when they saw\nSonata Sari and Fong Yu disguised as Oda\nShinbe, their expressions changed\nimmediately. They bowed to Sonata Sauri\nand Oda Shinbe and made way for them.\nThe leading male warrior hesitated for a\nlong time before finally stepping\nforward and knocking on the door.\nKnock-knock knock. As the knocking\nsounded, the chaotic noise inside the\nhouse abruptly stopped, followed by a\nfurious voice coming from within. Baka,\nwho dares to disturb this general's\nenjoyment. Do you want to die? Upon\nhearing the voice, the male samurai who\nhad knocked on the door immediately\nknelt on the ground in fright, saying in\na panic, \"General, please calm down.\nIt's Sonata Sari and Lord Oda who have\nreturned. They've also brought back a\nprisoner saying they want to hand him\nover to you for personal interrogation.\"\nAfter a moment of silence, a series of\nunsteady footsteps yanked open the door.\nA middle-aged man with a bare chest and\na mustache. His eyes glazed with\ndrunkenness glanced outside. Upon seeing\nSonata Sauri and Fong Yu disguised as\nOda Shinbe, he shook his head and rubbed\nhis eyes in disbelief. It really is the\ntwo of you. The man with the mustache\nstanding in front of the door said in\ndisbelief. Sonata Sari whispered to Fong\nYu beside her. He is Takahashi Riyosuk,\none of Tojo&lt;unk&gt;s adviserss. He's a\nshameless lecher, but he's quite\ncapable. Fongu nodded slightly to show\nthat he understood. Riosuk Takahashi\nyelled, \"Hey, why aren't you saying\nanything? Where were you guys yesterday?\nOne of you was protecting the village\nand the other was going back to help.\"\nAnd when we came back, the entire Han\nKio was burned down. Bastards. Upon\nhearing this, Sonata Sari coldly\nreplied, \"Who do you think you are? Do I\nneed to report to you? Get out of the\nway. We need to go in and see General\nTojo. You baka. Upon hearing this,\nRiosuk Takahashi frowned and immediately\ndrew his sword, pointing it at Sour\nSonata. He wanted to say something more,\nbut at that moment, another deep and\ncold voice came from inside the room.\nAll right, Takahashi Kuan, let them in.\nUpon hearing this, Takahashi Riosuk, who\nwas blocking the doorway, glared at\nSonata Sari and said, \"If you don't\nexplain yourself clearly, you're dead.\"\nBut when he saw Oda Shinbe, who was\npretending to be fierce, he\nsubconsciously shrank back, sheathed his\nsword, and made way for him. So,\nSonatasari walked through the door first\nwhile Fong Yu followed behind, holding\nthe bound Olivia. It wasn't until then\nthat the drowsy Takahashi Riosuk finally\nsaw Olivia, the tall blonde woman with\nan angelic face and a devilish figure.\nHe was completely stunned compared to\nher. The woman they had been playing\nwith in the room was nothing more than\nan ordinary woman. Riosuk Takahashi\nwatched Olivia's retreating figure as\nshe entered the house, swallowing hard.\nAlthough he knew he wouldn't get a\nchance to be the first to enjoy the\nsoup. Even the leftovers were far more\ninteresting than the women in the house.\nAnd that damn Sonata Sari. Relying on\nher sharp swordsmanship. She's always\nlooked down on Takahashi Riosuk. When\nthe general questions her later, I'll\nhave to say a few more things to\nbadmouth her. if she could provoke the\ngeneral to punish her, perhaps. He with\na lewd smile, Riosuk Takahashi closed\nthe door again, looking forward to the\nexciting part after the interrogation\nended. Upon entering the house, Fong Yu\nimmediately noticed four shirtless men\nkneeling on either side. The tall, thin\nman at the head of the group wearing a\nloose black robe sat casually in the\nmain seat. If he wasn't mistaken, this\ntall, thin man in the main seat should\nbe Tojo Murisha. Besides, there was a\nstrange smell in the room. Fong Yu\nglanced at the corner of the room, and\nsure enough, he saw more than a dozen\ndisheveled women tidying up their\nclothes in the corner. As Fong Yu and\nhis companions entered, the gazes of the\nfive men in the room quickly swept over\nSonata Sauri and Fong Yu, finally\nlanding on Olivia's face. Instantly,\ntheir gazes were fixed on her and their\neyes began to scan Olivia from head to\ntoe. Their eyes gradually becoming more\nunrestrained and a lwd smile appeared on\ntheir lips. Feeling the lewd gazes of\nthese people, a hint of murderous intent\nflashed in Olivia's eyes. At this\nmoment, Tojo Miroida, sitting in the\nmain seat, was the first to shift his\ngaze from Olivia to Fong Yu, who was\ndisguised as Oda Shinbe, and said, \"Oda,\nsince you're not dead, why haven't you\nreplied to my messages? And who is this\nwoman?\" Fong Yu glanced around,\nconfirming that there were only these\nfive men in the room, plus Takahashi\nRiosuk standing at the door, making a\ntotal of six men. He then gave a strange\nsmile and said, \"The reason Oda isn't\nreplying to your messages is because\nhe's really dead.\" As for her, Fongu\nglanced at Olivia, took out her iron axe\nfrom his storage ring, handed it to her,\nand said, \"She's here to take your dog\nlives.\" Chapter 159, the showdown\nbetween old coins. In fact, Tojo\nMirisha, since something was wrong the\nmoment Odisa Shinbe entered the room. As\na high-ranking ninja of the shadow sect,\nhe always paid close attention to\ndetails. He didn't notice anything wrong\nwith Sonata Sari, who was the first to\nenter. But when Oda Shimbe walked in, he\nnoticed something was a miss. He noticed\nthat Oda's height had increased by about\n2 in compared to before, and that his\npreviously pigeon toed walking posture\nhad changed to a normal walking posture.\nWhile walking posture can change,\nthere's no reason why height can\nsuddenly increase. Although there are\nitems that increase attributes in this\nsurvival world, Tojo Miroa has never\nheard of any item that can change one's\nheight. Therefore, Tojo immediately\nconcluded that there must be something\nwrong with Oda. Originally, Tojo Miro\nplanned to pretend he hadn't discovered\nOda's problem. First, find out what this\nfake Oda was saying, and see where he\ncame from before notifying the outsiders\nto come and surround him. But to\neveryone's surprise, this guy didn't put\non an act as he expected. Instead, he\nimmediately dropped the pretense, pulled\nout his weapon, and was ready to fight.\nYou're not playing by the rules here.\nWhile Tojo Miros was still in a daysaze,\nSonata Sari had already drawn her\nkatana, and slashed at the nearest\nsamurai. Caught off guard, the samurai\nhad his head severed in one blow, and\nblood spurted out like a fountain. At\nthe same time, the female prisoner\nsuddenly broke free of her ropes, took\nthe iron axe, and slashed at another\nwarrior. Upon seeing this, Tojo Miroa\nimmediately rolled to his backpack, took\nout four shuriken, and shot them at\nSonata Sarari. At the same time, he took\nout a thin, completely black sword from\nhis backpack, and then disappeared into\nthe shadows of the house. At the same\ntime, Sonatasari blocked two of the four\nshuriken that Tojo fired while one of\nthe other two pierced her shoulder and\nthe other pierced her corateed artery.\nIf Sonata Sari were still an ordinary\nperson, those four shuriken would have\nbeen enough to kill her, which shows\nthat Tojo Murakami's fighting strength\nwas extremely high. However, Sonatasari\nis now an undead. She completely ignores\nthe two shuriken embedded in her body\nand continues to slash at another\nsamurai with her katana. Olivia, who is\nstanding nearby, kills one samurai, but\ndoes not pursue the others. Instead, she\nretreats to Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s side. That\nperson has hidden in the shadows. Be\ncareful, Olivia warned. Fun nodded. He\nknew he wasn't immortal, so he was in\ndanger when facing an enemy who could\nturn invisible and attack from a\ndistance. So he took out an invisibility\ncloak from his backpack and prepared to\nput it on. You can become invisible. So\ncan I. Just as Fong Yu was putting on\nhis cloak, for black shurikens suddenly\nshot out from the shadows not far away,\nheading straight for Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s face.\nFortunately, Olivia had been keeping a\nclose eye on her surroundings. She\nimmediately used her iron ax to block\ntwo of them and then used her own body\nto shield Fongu from the remaining two.\nIn the shadows, Tojo Mirishida, who\nwitnessed this scene, narrowed his eyes.\nJudging from the blonde woman's actions,\nthe guy disguised as Oda Shinbe was\nprobably the mastermind behind the\nattack, holding the highest position,\nbut his strength didn't seem to be the\ngreatest. At least that guy's physique\nis different from Sonata Saris and that\nwoman's. He doesn't seem capable of\ntaking his shuriken headon. Therefore,\nTojo Mirosa decided to target Odinbe if\nhe could kill or control him. Sonata\nSari and that woman would most likely\nsurrender. But when Tojo Mirosa moved to\na different position in the shadows,\nwanting to shoot at Oda Shinbe from a\ndifferent angle, he found that the guy\nhad disappeared. Could the other party\nalso be invisible? Tojo frowned. This\nput him in a difficult position. If he\ncouldn't find Oda Shinbe, he would have\nno choice but to attack Sonata Sari and\nthe blonde woman. However, judging from\nhis previous attack, these two women\ncould completely ignore the damage from\nhis shuriken. You should know that your\nshuriken is not only incredibly sharp,\nbut it's also coated with a deadly\npoison. While it may not be a complete\nsuffocation, anyone hit will lose their\nmobility within a very short time,\nbecoming a lamb to the slaughter.\nAlthough Tojo didn't know the blonde\nwoman, he did know Sonatasari. Although\nSonatas Sari's swordsmanship was indeed\nsuperb, she was just an ordinary person.\nBut how could an ordinary person\ncontinue fighting completely unaffected\nwhen her artery was hit by a shuriken\nand she was poisoned? This left Tojo\nMirisha completely baffled. So Tojo\nstarted sending messages in the chat\nchannels of Han Kio summoning his\nsubordinates to come and help. At this\nmoment, because Olivia was protecting\nFong Yu, Sonata Sari was fighting three\nsamurai alone. Those who could enjoy\nthemselves in the same room as the lord\nwere naturally the strongest samurai in\nHano. So under the combined attack of\nthe three, Sonatasari quickly fell into\na disadvantageous position and began to\nbe stabbed repeatedly. If it weren't for\nher immortality, she would probably have\nbeen defeated long ago. Fortunately,\nafter Fong Yu successfully dawned the\ninvisibility cloak, Olivia was able to\nfree her hands and prepare to go forward\nto help. However, at this moment, the\ndoor of the house was kicked open, and\nmore than a dozen sword- wielding\nwarriors rushed in from outside. Olivia\nhad no choice but to turn around and\ndeal with the dozen or so warriors who\nhad just rushed in. Just then, a strange\nwind suddenly swept through the room,\nand two invisible windb blades pierced\nthrough the hall, striking the two\nsamurai who were besieging Sonatasari.\nOne samurai's neck was severed by the\nwindb blade, leaving him a headless\ncorpse. The other samurai reacted more\nquickly, noticing the approaching wind\nblades immediately and dodging them with\na sideep. However, the wind blades still\ncut a bloody gash on his neck, forcing\nthe wounded samurai to retreat to a\ncorner. With two fewer samurai attacking\nher, Sonata Sari felt much less pressure\nand began to fight the last samurai with\nall her might. For a moment, the swords\nflashed and the sound of metal clashing\nrang out. Olivia, with her formidable\nfighting prowess, successfully\nsuppressed the dozen or so samurai at\nthe entrance. Meanwhile, the two main\ncharacters in this battle, Tojo Mirosa,\nand Fong Yu, each concealed their\npresence and searched for each other's\nlocation. This is a duel between two old\ncoins. Whoever kills the other will have\nto rely on their superior skills.\nChapter 160, the new Lord of District 7.\nAnyone who has played PUBG knows that\nwhen two players meet, it's a contest of\npatience. Whoever reveals themselves\nfirst will be the one who dies. Tojo\nMirosa's advantage is that he can move\nfreely in any shaded area and he is\nimmune to physical attacks while in the\nshadows. However, his disadvantage is\nthat he cannot hide in areas with light\nsources. Therefore, in order to expand\nhis range of movement, Tojo Miroa used\nShuriken to extinguish several torches\nin the house, further expanding the area\nof shadow. Fong Yu's advantage is that\nhe can cast magic and Sonata Saari is\nabout to defeat her opponent with her\nimmortality while Olivia is also holding\nthe line suppressing the samurai at the\ndoor so that they dare not take a step\ninto the house. Finally, Tojo Miroida\ncouldn't hold back any longer. Since he\ncouldn't find Oda Shinbe, he decided to\ndeal with Sonatasari first. Just as\nSonata Sari was about to strike the last\nsamurai in the neck, a black blade\nsuddenly emerged from the shadows\nbeneath her feet, severing Sonatasari's\nleft leg. Losing her left leg,\nSonatasari immediately lost her balance\nand fell to the ground. At that moment,\nTojo's figure emerged from the shadows,\nready to decapitate Sonata Saari with a\nsingle strike. After confirming Tojo's\nlocation, Fong Yu immediately unleashed\na wind blade towards his back. Tojo\nsurprisingly sensed the wind blade\ncoming from behind and hid in the\nshadows again. Fongu could only control\nthe windb blade to continue attacking\nthe last samurai who wanted to finish\noff Sonatasari. A line of blood flew up\nas the last samurai's arm was severed by\nthe windb blade. He screamed in agony as\nhe collapsed to the ground, struggling\nto stay afloat. Seeing Sonata Sour lying\non the ground with her left legs\nsevered, Fong Yu frowned. He decided not\nto play hideand seek with Tojo anymore.\nSo he began to summon fireballs and\nthrow them around. I'll burn this house\ndown. Let's see where you can hide then.\nHowever, as Fong Yu launched a series of\nfireballs, he also revealed his\nposition. Tojo Mirisha, who had been\nwaiting for this opportunity, smiled\ncoldly and unleashed his ultimate\ntechnique, Shadow Strike. As Tojo\nMurakami unleashed his ultimate\ntechnique, dozens of humanoid shadowy\nfigures wielding black blades instantly\nappeared in the surrounding shadows.\nThese shadowy figures then launched a\nsurprise attack on Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s\nlocation. Seeing the dark figures\nattacking him, Fong Yu knew his position\nhad been exposed, so he stopped hiding\ninstantly cast wind dance and leaped\ninto the air, dodging the attacks of the\ndark figures. At this moment, he also\nspotted the last shadow where Tojo was\nhiding under the flames ignited by the\nfireball and shot a fireball at it. Once\nthe last shadow was illuminated by the\nfireball, Tojo had nowhere left to hide.\nHe spent a second pondering whether to\ncontinue controlling the shadow to\nattack Oda Shinbe or to dodge the\nfireball hurtling towards him. In the\nend, he chose the latter since the\nshadowy figure was no match for the\nincoming fireball. So Tojo rolled to the\nwindow at the back of the house, ready\nto break through the window and escape.\nOnce outside, under the cover of\ndarkness, he could hide again. Just as\nTojo Miroa jumped out of the window,\nthinking he could escape, a red shadow\nsuddenly darted out of the darkness.\nThen Tojo Mishida felt a sharp pain in\nhis left leg, as if something had bitten\nhim. Snap. As Alpha bit down hard,\nTojo's leg bone was snapped off, and he\ncollapsed to the ground with a scream.\nDespite the pain, Tojo forced Alpha back\nwith a swing of his black sword, then\nrolled to the side and hid in the\nshadows. But Alpha only sniffed the air\nbefore locking onto Tojo's location and\nquickly giving chase. This time, Alpha\ndidn't give its opponent a chance to\nretaliate. It aimed at Tojo's sword\nwielding arm and bit down hard. Ah! With\na scream from Tojo, the black sword fell\nto the ground. Alpha quickly followed\nwith two more blows, crippling\nTojo&lt;unk&gt;'s other leg and arm. Hearing\nTojo's screams coming from outside, Fong\nYu breathed a sigh of relief. It seemed\nthat it was right for him to have Alpha\nlie and ambush outside, otherwise that\nguy would have really escaped.\nImmediately, Fong Yu picked up Sonata\nSauri and her broken leg from the\nground, called out to Olivia, then\njumped out of the window and ran towards\nAlfa's location. Olivia quickly\nfollowed, knocked Tojo unconscious with\nthe axe handle, and then carried him on\nher shoulder. At that moment, the\nsamurai in front of the wooden house\nalso came around with torches. Seeing\nthis, Fong Yu immediately used wind\ndance on himself, Olivia, and Alpha. The\ntwo of them along with Sonata Saari and\nFong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s arms and Tojo Miroida on\nOlivia's shoulder rushed to the top of\nthe wall and jumped down running towards\nthe dense forest. Evacuation successful.\nAfter running into the dense forest and\nconfirming that no one from the village\nhad chased after him, Fongu breathed a\nsigh of relief, put Sonata Sari down and\nthen reattached her severed leg. \"Via,\nhelp her with the treatment,\" Fongu\nsaid. So Olivia dropped Tojo from her\nshoulder and bent down to use her energy\nto help Sonata Sari heal her wounds\nfaster. \"I'm sorry I've dragged you\ndown,\" Sonata Saari said apologetically.\n\"We're&lt;unk&gt; all on the same side, so\ndon't say things like that.\" Fong Yu\nwaved his hand and said, \"Actually, it\nwas my oversight that led to you being\nin danger. It's my fault.\" Upon hearing\nFong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s words, a hint of emotion\nflashed in Sonata Sari&lt;unk&gt;s eyes. Only\nthen did she realize that the man in\nfront of her was indeed different from\nothers just as he had said. Although he\nis powerful, he is not doineering, which\nis a rare quality. After Olivia healed\nSonata SAE's leg injury, they led Tojo\nand 500 zombies back towards District 6.\nOverall, the operation went relatively\nsmoothly. Apart from slightly\nunderestimating Tojo's strength and\nalmost letting him escape, everything\nelse went according to plan. Finally,\nnear dawn, Fong Yu and his group settled\nthe zombie core, returned to the manor\nand led Tojo to the cemetery. Next, all\nI need to do is put him in the graveyard\nand turn him into an undead, and my goal\nwill be achieved. So, Fun Yu threw the\nunconscious Tojo Miroa into a coffin.\nBut after waiting for a minute, the\ngoddess statue in the cemetery did not\nreact at all. \"Huh? What's going on?\"\nFunu asked, somewhat surprised. However,\nOlivia said, \"To become an undead, one\nmust first be completely dead or on the\nverge of death.\" Upon hearing this,\nFongu slapped his forehead. I almost\nforgot about this step. So, he took out\nthe black gold ancient sword, ready to\nfinish off Tojo with one strike. But at\nthat moment, Sonata Sari called out to\nhim. Wait a moment. Fu raised an\neyebrow, turned to look at Sonata Sari,\nand asked, \"What's wrong?\" Sonata Sari\nhesitated for a moment, then said, \"If I\nremember correctly, if he dies, will the\ntitle of Lord of District 7 be directly\ntransferred to the person with the most\nresources in District 7?\" Funu took a\ndeep breath. He had actually forgotten\nabout this rule. \"If I were to strike\nwith this blade, then my entire trip\nwould have been for nothing. Is there\nany way to remedy this?\" Fongu squinted\nand thought for a while before going\ninto the house. He put all the valuables\nin the warehouse into his storage ring,\nthen went outside and placed the storage\nring in Sonata Sari's hand, saying,\n\"Wear this.\" Huh? Sonatasari accepted\nthe ring, puzzled. \"Now ask your game\nassistant what your total resources\nare.\" After Sonata Sari did as she was\ntold, her eyes widened in surprise and\nshe covered her mouth, exclaiming, \"Over\n1.3 million.\" She glanced at the ring in\nher hand and exclaimed in amazement.\nThere are actually supplies worth over a\nmillion in this. Fongu chuckled and\nsaid, \"Now, you should have the most\nsupplies in District 7, right?\"\nSonatasari glanced at Fong Yu and\ninstantly understood. You mean? That's\nright. Fong Yu pulled the unconscious\nTojo Mirosa out of the coffin, then\nplunged the black gold ancient sword in\nhis hand into his chest. Now you should\nbe the new lord of District 7. Chapter\n161 to a better life and the future of\nhumanity. Cheers. Lord Tojo Miroa of\nDistrict 7 has died. Let us observe 3\nseconds of silence for the first lord to\nfall. The new lord of District 7 is the\nplayer with the most resources in\nDistrict 7. Sonata Sari,\ncongratulations.\nFong Yu and Sonata Sauri saw the latest\nannouncement from the system at the same\ntime and smiled at each other. Although\nthe decapitation operation went a bit\nawful, Fong Yu ultimately managed to\nbring the position of District 7 Lord\ninto his hands. Then another\nannouncement came out. Oh, and one more\nthing. On the last day of summer, a\nLord's tournament will be held. 10 lords\nwill each lead 10 subjects into the\nancient battlefield in the center of\ntheir 10 regions. The lord who\nultimately seizes the throne of the\nancient battlefield will be victorious,\nreceiving a 30% boost to all attributes.\nDoesn't that sound exciting? Therefore,\nlords, hurry up and improve your\nstrength in the next few days, or you\nmight become someone else's stepping\nstone. Fong Yu and Sonata Sari both saw\nthe latest announcement from the system\nat the same time. Sonata Sari frowned,\nwhile Fong Yu, who had known this would\nhappen, didn't care. This lord's\ntournament looks very unfriendly, said\nsonata. It's forcing us to fight each\nother. Fongu nodded and said, this is a\nconspiracy by the god of light, the\nmastermind behind the game in order to\ncreate competition and chaos and reduce\nthe number of us players as much as\npossible. Have you spoken to the other\nlords and asked them to stop fighting?\nFunu sighed and said, I've already said\nit, but it's no use. The god of light\nhas taken advantage of human greed and\nselfishness which is something we can't\nchange. The only thing we can do is to\nreplace all those lords according to my\nplan so as to achieve peaceful\nunification. Sonata Sari nodded\nseriously took off the ring on her hand\nreturned it to Fong Yu and asked so what\nshould I do next? After thinking for a\nmoment, Fongu replied, \"First create a\nnew group and then announce in the\nseventh district channel that the\nseventh district will be peacefully\nmerged into the sixth district tomorrow.\nAll players in the seventh district will\nhave one day to consider whether they\nare willing to peacefully merge into the\nsixth district. Those who are willing\ncan join your new group, and those who\nare not willing can transfer to other\ndistricts. One day later, the sixth\ndistrict will take over the seventh\ndistrict and clear out all players who\nare unwilling to join the sixth\ndistrict. Won't this cause a lot of\nplayers to leave? Sonataari asked. After\nall, not all players have a good\nimpression of server 6. Fongu smiled and\nsaid, \"I understand what you mean.\nThat's perfect. It can filter out\nplayers who don't like zone 6 or those\nwho don't like China, which will reduce\na lot of trouble.\" Then Sonata Sari\nadded, \"But I'm not very good at being a\nmanager. I'm just a warrior.\" \"This\nisn't a big problem,\" Fongi replied.\n\"Actually, by the day after tomorrow,\nyou can directly merge District 7 into\nDistrict 6.\" At that time, the\nmanagement task will fall on the Lord of\nDistrict 6, and you can take a break\nlike me.\" At this point, Fongu glanced\nat the time. It was almost midnight, so\nhe said, \"All right, it's getting late.\nYou can rest here tonight.\" Hm. Sonata\nSari paused slightly upon hearing this,\nthen blushed slightly and asked, \"Is\nthis convenient? Let me think about it.\"\nFunu thought about it carefully. His\ncabin only had three rooms. One for\nhimself, one for Olivia, and one for\nValentina. Even Alpha had to sleep in\nthe living room, which did seem rather\ninconvenient. Tsk tsk looks like I need\nto hurry up and upgrade the house again.\nBut then Olivia reminded her. Master\nValentina will be guarding the tree of\nlife in the woods tonight. So her room\nis empty. All right. Fongu slapped his\nforehead and sighed. Sigh. I've been so\nbusy these past few days. I can't even\nremember anything. But it doesn't seem\nquite right to let someone else sleep in\nValentina's room without her consent.\nFor a moment, Fu was in a bit of a\ndilemma. So he slapped his thigh and\nsaid, \"Fine, sorry. Why don't you sleep\nin my bedroom? Huh? Sonata Sari&lt;unk&gt;s\neyes widened. Olivia who was standing\nnearby also frowned. But then Fong Yu\nadded. Alpha and I will sleep in the\nliving room tonight. Oh, that won't do.\nHow can I let you sleep in the living\nroom? Sonata Sari shook her head and\nsaid, \"Actually, I'm not sleepy either.\nI feel like I don't really need to rest\nafter becoming an undead.\" Fongu raised\nan eyebrow upon hearing this and asked\nOlivia, \"Is that so?\" Olivia nodded and\nsaid, \"Indeed, the undead can go for\ndays without rest without any problem.\nHow about this, master? You can let her\nstay in my room tonight. I can also tell\nher about some of the characteristics\nand abilities of the undead.\" All right,\nit's settled then. So, they went into\nthe house together. Fong Yu first took a\nshower in the bathroom and then went to\nthe kitchen to prepare a late night\nsnack. While making the late night\nsnack, Fong Yu let Sonata Sari and\nOlivia, who were covered in blood, take\na shower. When the two girls came out of\nthe shower, Fongu had already put the\nskewers in the fireplace and started\ngrilling them. \"It'll be ready in 10\nmore minutes,\" Fun Yu said without\nturning around, squatting in front of\nthe fireplace, and fanning the fire. \"To\ncelebrate the success of our operation\ntoday, let's&lt;unk&gt; have a good meal\ntonight.\" \"Master,\" Sonata Sari\nwhispered from behind. This was the\nfirst time in her life that she had\ncalled someone master and she felt\nsomewhat ashamed. Huh? What's wrong?\nFong Yu turned around and asked, but\nthen he saw Sonata Sari standing at the\nbathroom door wrapped in a thin linen\ncloth while Olivia next to her was also\nwearing a linen dress. But her proud\nfigure was still clearly visible. The\ntall Olivia looked energetic while the\npetite Sonata Sari looked gentle and\nlovely. These two beauties with very\ndifferent styles who had just finished\nbathing stood together and immediately\ncreated a vivid and charming picture of\nbeauties emerging from the water. Upon\nseeing this painting of a beautiful\nwoman emerging from the water, Fong Yu\nraised an eyebrow slightly, instantly\nfeeling his blood pressure sore.\nAlthough reluctant, he forced his gaze\nback to the barbecue and asked somewhat\nthirsty, \"What's wrong?\" Seeing Fong\nYu&lt;unk&gt;s embarrassed look, Sonata Saari\nsmiled slightly and said, \"I don't have\nany clothes to wear.\" \"Oh, right.\" Fong\nYu then remembered that there didn't\nseem to be any extra clothes at home.\nSo, he quickly took some linen from the\nstore room and came to the workbench to\nmake a few sets of clothes for Sonata\nSari. But then the meat on the barbecue\ngrill was cooked again. So, Fongu\nquickly went back to the fireplace to\ncollect the meat to prevent it from\nburning. Watching Fongu frantically\noperate the system, Sonata Sari smiled\nslightly. She suddenly realized that\nalthough this man was decisive and\nruthless in battle, inspiring awe from\nthe bottom of one's heart, he was like\nan ordinary boy next door in life,\ngiving people a genuine feeling. After\nfinishing her clothes, Sonata Sari went\nto Olivia's room to change and came out.\nAt that moment, Funu placed the grilled\nmeat on the dining table. Then he took\nout the cola, beer, and other drinks he\nhad won from the tentacle monsters\nroulette. \"Let's raise a glass,\" Fong Yu\nsaid with a smile, picking up the beer\nhe had poured to a better life and to\nthe future of humanity. \"Cheers!\"\nChapter 162. The jealous female ghost.\nAfter a hearty meal and drinks, it was\nalready past 2 a.m. Fongu said goodbye\nto Olivia, Alpha, and Sonatasari before\nreturning to his bedroom. Perhaps\nbecause his biological clock had been\ndisrupted these past two days, he didn't\nfeel sleepy. So, he decided to use up\nthe remaining hundred or so chances to\nwin the lottery and see if he could get\nanything good. But when he opened the\nhonor points lottery interface and tried\nto summon the lottery wheel, the game\nassistant sent him a message. You've\nemptied the prize pool of the lucky draw\nwheel. It's gone back to restock and\nwon't be back for a while. Seeing this\nmessage, Fong Yu was both amused and\nexasperated. He hadn't expected that his\n3010 pulls today would have drained the\nlottery wheel dry. But it was all for\nthe best. When it returned next time,\nthere should be new artifacts to draw,\nright? After failing to win the lottery,\nFongu began to organize his thoughts and\nthink about what to do tomorrow. First,\nhe had to send 20 roasted pigs to the\ngiant dragon in the south. Only when he\nthought of this did Fong Yu realize that\nthe pigs hadn't been roasted yet. The\nthought of roasting 20 pigs gave him a\nheadache. Actually, the 20 roasted pigs\nare secondary. The important thing is\nwhen to poison them and whether to\npoison them at all. Judging from\nyesterday's encounter with the dragon,\nit is actually very vigilant. It would\ncarefully sniff the roasted pig before\neating it. To be honest, Fong was not\nsure if the dragon could smell the\npoison that Valentina had concocted. If\nit could, he might have to face the\ndragon in its full power and in a rage,\nwhich would be fatal. Therefore, it's\nbest for the dragons to hold their\nground for now and wait until their own\nstrength has made a significant\nbreakthrough before taking action. Next\nis the peaceful annexation of district\n7. Last night after Sonata Sari as the\nlord of district 7 announced in the\ndistrict 7 chat channel that she would\nbe merging into district 6. The three\nsmall factions in district 7 did not\nreact much. However, the remaining few\nhundred players in Han Ko expressed\nstrong opposition even saying that\nSonata Sari was a traitor and the\nculprit who killed the former lord of\ndistrict 7. So they refused to accept\nher as the lord and even threatened to\nmake her pay for her blood death. Fongu\nknew that the people who said these\nwords were probably the subordinates of\nTojo Murish in Hano. Those people were\nunwilling to accept Sonata Sari's status\nas lord nor were they willing to\ntransfer to another district. It seemed\nthat they intended to resist to the end.\nThese stubborn guys would have to be\ndealt with tomorrow. Sonata Sari\nmentioned during her late night snack\nlast night that there is actually\nanother very powerful figure in Hong Ko\nnamed Yuritsamasaru who is considered\nthe second most powerful person in Hano.\nThis rea is very mysterious and even\ndares to disregard the orders given by\nTojo village. Tojo doesn't dare to do\nanything to him. From this Sonata judges\nthat Regina's strength should be above\nTojo's. Tojo only got the position of\nlord by winning the election and having\nthe most resources through his own\nconnections last night. Liuany must have\nrealized that Fong Yu and his group's\ntarget was Tojo Miroa, which is why he\ndidn't help them. He probably wanted to\ntake over the lord's position after Tojo\nMirosa was killed. However, he didn't\nexpect that Sonata Sari would take over\nas the lord of the seventh district.\nTherefore, Fong Yu estimated that the\none who really instigated the players in\nHong Ko to refuse the position of Lord\nSonatasari was Luana. So, he wanted to\nmake the players in Hong Ko give up\ntheir feudal resistance and focus on\ngetting rid of Li Yuana. So, in the end,\nI still have to go to Han Kio again and\nfight again. Just thinking about it\ngives me a headache. Besides the dragon\nand Han Kio, there was another matter\nthat Fong Yu was concerned about. the\nauspicious beasts of this region. After\na day of investigation and a hefty\nreward, Song Jimming finally obtained\nsome reliable information. In a lake 7\nkm south of King's Landing, a strange\ncreature was discovered that emits eerie\nyet melodious songs, attracting a large\nnumber of creatures to linger by the\nlake. Surprisingly, both ferocious\ntigers and irritable wild boars became\nvery docel and showed no aggression when\nthey came to the lake. Therefore, Fongu\nplans to go to that lake tomorrow to see\nwhat kind of creature it is and whether\nit is the auspicious beast from this\narea. Thinking of this, Fongu couldn't\nhelp but sigh again. Life was getting\nmore and more tiring. He started to miss\nthe leisurely time when he first entered\nthe game. Chopping down trees, picking\nmushrooms, and occasionally killing a\nfew wild boars. Sigh. There's no going\nback. He knew that from the moment he\ndecided to challenge the manipulators\nbehind the game, he was destined to\nnever again live the comfortable life he\nhad before. But since this is a world of\nsurvival, he has to push himself to\nsurvive and win the game. Forget it.\nI'll stop thinking about it now or it'll\nbe dawn soon. Meanwhile, in Olivia's\nroom next door, the female knight was\nsitting cross-legged on the bed,\nexplaining the precautions for the\nundead to the kneeling female warrior.\nAlthough we call ourselves the undead or\nthe immortals, you know the truth. We\nare already dead, just resurrected,\nOlivia said. What's the difference?\nSonata Sari asked curiously and\nearnestly. The reason we were able to be\nresurrected is because the goddess of\nlife and death bestowed upon us the\ndivine power to control life and death.\nOlivia explained, \"Once the goddess's\ndivine power disappears, you and I will\nturn back into corpses. That's the\ndifference between us and the living. Do\nyou understand? Sonata Sari tilted her\nhead and thought for a moment before\nsuddenly realizing. I understand what\nyou mean is that we are currently\nrelying on the goddess's divine power to\nmaintain our lives which is an external\nforce while the life force of the living\nis their own and does not need to rely\non external forces. Is that what you\nmean? Olivia nodded and said, \"Yes. So\nyou must remember that our weakness is\nany power that can harm the goddess's\nimmortality. What forces can harm the\ngoddess's divine power? The most\neffective counter to the power of the\nimmortal god is the power of light from\nthe god of light. Sunlight contains a\nvery faint amount of light that can harm\nthe skeletonized zombies because the\ngoddess's life force is stored in our\nbones. However, in our current state\nwith muscles and skin covering us,\nsunlight can no longer harm us, but it\nwill still suppress our power to some\nextent. I understand senior means that\nwe are at our strongest at night. No,\nit's in places where there is no\nsunlight, such as underground or\nindoors. So in addition, some believers\nwho worship the god of light or other\ndeities can also use the power they\nreceive from the gods to harm our\nimmortality such as the light mages and\npriests of the church of light or the\npower of shamanism or the power of other\ndeities. Sonata Sari nodded earnestly\nand wrote it down. Also, we must pay\nspecial attention to fire magic and the\nrelatively rare lightning magic in the\nelemental system. These two types of\nmagic are the only two elemental magics\nthat can harm us. When encountering\nthese two types of magic, we must not\ntry to withstand them with our bodies.\nOkay, I understand. Seeing Sonata\nSauri's earnest and humble demeanor,\nOlivia smiled slightly and asked, \"I\nthink your swordsmanship is actually\nquite good, containing an indomitable\nspirit. If combined with your current\nimmortal body, you should be able to\nmaximize the advantages of your\nswordsmanship. Sonata Sari was slightly\ntaken aback upon hearing this after\ntilting her head and thinking for a\nmoment. She said with delight, \"Senpai\nis right. The essence of the chaotic\nblade slash is indeed about facing death\nnine times out of 10 and having an\nunwavering belief. Many of the moves are\ndeadly attacks that leave no way out for\noneself. In the past, because I valued\nmy life, I never dared to use those\nmoves. Now that I have an immortal body,\nI can definitely try those moves. Olivia\nnodded and said, \"When you have free\ntime, you can practice more with your\nmaster. This will not only improve your\nswordsmanship, but also help your master\nimprove his strength.\" Upon hearing\nOlivia mention Fongu, Sonata Sari's\nexpression immediately became curious.\nMaster is really amazing. He's clearly a\nmagician, but he's also very strong in\nclose combat and knows archery. It's\nlike he can do everything. Olivia gave\nSonata Sari a half smile and asked you\nlike master while Sonata Sari was lost\nin thought. She blurted out who wouldn't\nlike a man who is both strong and\ngentle. But Sonatasari quickly realized\nwhat she meant. She glanced at Olivia,\nthought of a possibility and hurriedly\nwaved her hand to explain, \"Oh, that's\nnot what I meant. Please don't\nmisunderstand.\" Olivia waved her hand\nand said, \"All right, you don't need to\nexplain to me. It's your freedom to like\nwhomever you want. Besides, the master\ndoes have his merits, but I just want to\nremind you.\" At this point, Olivia\nraised an eyebrow slightly and said,\n\"There's also a very jealous female\nghost in this house. The key is that the\nfemale ghost is also very powerful, so\nyou'd better be careful.\" Chapter 163.\nauspicious beast appears. At dawn, the\ndoor of the cabin suddenly opened and\nValentina floated in excitedly. She\ncouldn't wait to tell Fong Yu that the\nsapling of the tree of life had grown\nsteadily and had given birth to a tree\nspirit. But soon after entering the\nhouse, Valentina sensed an unfamiliar\natmosphere and it seems to be a woman.\nValentina followed the scent to Olivia's\nbedroom door and breathed a sigh of\nrelief. Thankfully, it wasn't her\nmaster's bedroom. At that moment, Olivia\nopened the door and looked at the female\nghost floating in front of her door,\nasking, \"What is it?\" Valentina glanced\nat Olivia and said indifferently,\n\"Nothing. Just came to see if you tried\nto seduce master while I was away.\"\n\"Hump.\" Olivia rolled her eyes and\nreplied, \"Don't think of me as you.\" \"By\nthe way, why do I sense the presence of\na strange woman?\" Valentina asked again.\nAt that moment, Sonata Sari peakedked\nout from behind Olivia and cautiously\ngreeted the female ghost. \"Hello.\"\nValentina glanced at the petite and\ncut-looking girl, then looked at the\ntall Olivia. As if she suddenly\nunderstood something. Her eyes widened\nas she exclaimed, \"Unbelievable. I've\nknown you for so long, and I only just\nfound out you're interested in women.\"\nOlivia took a deep breath, forcibly\nsuppressing her anger, and said\nindignantly, I said, \"How come your\nhead, you elf, is filled with nothing\nbut filthy things?\" \"What else? Why did\nyou bring a woman into your room to\nspend the night?\" Valentina said\nirritably, glancing sideways at her. \"So\nthat's why you haven't made a move on\nthe master yet. You found someone else\nyou love.\" Olivia clenched her fists and\ngritted her teeth, saying, \"If I weren't\nafraid of disturbing master's rest, I\nwould definitely teach you a lesson\nagain.\" At this moment, Sonata Sauri,\nwho was behind Olivia, noticed that the\natmosphere was not right and quickly\nexplained, \"It's not what you think. I\nwas just brought back by my master\nyesterday and was just resurrected as an\nundead.\" Since there was nowhere to\nsleep, my master arranged for me to stay\nwith Olivia for the time being. After\nhearing Sonata Sari's explanation, the\nfemale ghost took a closer look at the\nnew woman. With her willow leaf\neyebrows, almond-shaped eyes, long\nponytail, delicate nose, pink lips, and\nbaby fat, she certainly differed from\nOlivia's heroic spirit and her own\ncharm. Moreover, and more importantly,\nthis woman, like her master, is of the\nyellow- skinned race. \"So, this is what\nmaster likes,\" Valentina murmured with a\nhint of disappointment. Huh? Sonata Sari\ntilted her head puzzled and asked, \"What\nare you talking about?\" At this moment,\nOlivia said irritably, \"Ignore her.\nShe's mentally unstable.\" After saying\nthat, Olivia pushed Sonata Sari back and\nclosed the door. After a moment of\nstunned silence, the female ghost\noutside the door revealed a determined\nlight in her eyes. \"It seems I need to\nhurry up and recover my physical body.\nWe absolutely cannot let this woman get\nthere first. Valentina then returned to\nher room and began her cultivation. Fong\nYu almost slept until noon, but around\n10:00 a.m. Song Jimming began bombarding\nFong Yu with messages. Fong Yu opened\nthe chat window and saw that Song\nJimming was reminding him that a group\nof players from other factions in the\nregion had already gone to the lake\nwhere the auspicious beast might be\nhiding. So, he should hurry over there\nto avoid being intercepted. Funu was\nshocked. Someone was actually trying to\nsteal the auspicious beast from him. So,\nhe immediately jumped out of bed, rushed\nout of the bedroom in his underwear, and\nprepared to put on the pig king assault\nsuit hanging in the living room. But\njust as he grabbed one leg of his pants\nand was about to put it on, he saw\nSonata Sari standing in front of the\ndining table, looking at him with a\nsurprised expression. The awkward scene\nlasted for 0.5 seconds. Fong Yu quickly\nturned his back and Sonata Sari quickly\ncovered her eyes with her hands. Damn, I\ngot so used to it that I completely\nforgot about the new person coming into\nthe house. Fongu cursed inwardly because\nOlivia had always been in the form of a\nskeleton. Fongu had always treated her\nas a man. Although Olivia later returned\nto a woman's body, Fong Yu\nsubconsciously still regarded this\nfemale knight who was taller than him as\nhis buddy. As for Valentina, she was a\nfemale ghost, so Fong Yu didn't take her\nseriously. But now it's different.\nThere's a woman in the house. Helpless.\nFongu could only carry the assault suit\nfrom the hanger back to the bedroom. Put\nit on again, and then come out. I'm\nsorry. You must have found this amusing,\nFong Yu said awkwardly to Sonata Sari.\nSonata Sari shook her head and smiled.\nIt's all right. At this moment, Fong Yu\nsaw some ingredients and tools he had\nnever seen before on the table, but he\ndid see some things that had already\nbeen prepared. Is this sushi? Sonata\nSari nodded and said, \"Yes, I didn't\nhave much to do this morning. I happened\nto hear from Via Senpai that you usually\ncook lunch, so I thought I'd help make\nsome sushi.\" He Thank you for your\nthoughtfulness. Fong Yu smiled and said,\n\"Then you go ahead and do your work. I\nhave to go out with Olivia now, and I\nmight not be back by noon. If you're\nhungry, feel free to eat. Use whatever\nyou have in the fridge. Yes. Yes,\nsenior. At this moment, Fong Yu looked\naround and asked, \"By the way, where's\nOlivia?\" Senior Vaia is roasting wild\nboar outside. She said, \"You're going to\ndeliver roasted boar to the dragon\ntoday. Senior, you've actually gotten to\nknow such a powerful creature as a\ndragon.\" As she said this, Sonata\nSari&lt;unk&gt;s eyes shone with admiration.\nUh, seeing the girls admiring gaze, Fong\nYu scratched his head sheepishly and\nsaid, \"I wouldn't say we've met. I'm not\neven sure if we're friends or foes.\"\nSigh. I have something urgent to do\nright now. I can't talk to you for now.\nI'll chat with you when I get back. I'm\nleaving now. With that, Fongu rushed out\nof the house. Please be careful, senior.\nHave a safe journey. Sari&lt;unk&gt;s sweet\nvoice came from inside the room. He he I\nnever expected that this female warrior\nwho fights like a daredevil would be so\ncute in everyday life. Tsk tsk. Fong Yu\nsmiled and shook his head, then walked\nover to Olivia, who was roasting wild\nboar. Master, you've arrived. Olivia\nturned her head and said, \"A 18 of the\n20 wild boores are almost roasted, and\nthese last two are almost done.\" Um\nFongu walked around among the roasted\npigs and laughed. Not bad, Vaia.\nAlthough you can't cook, your barbecue\nskills are pretty good. Olivia smiled\nsheepishly and said, \"I haven't really\nlearned to cook, but when we were on\nmilitary campaigns, I often did\nbarbecues with the soldiers, so I just\nlearned how over time.\" Fongu nodded,\nwaved his hand to put all the roasted\nwild boores into his storage ring, and\nthen said to Olivia, \"All right, let's\nnot worry about that now. There's\nsomething important we need to do, and\nwe have to set off immediately.\" Upon\nhearing that it was something important,\nOlivia immediately frowned and asked,\n\"What is it?\" Let's set off first and\nI'll talk to you as we go. Chapter 164.\nThe Him Mermaid. According to the map,\nthe lake that Song Jimming mentioned is\nlocated at the southernmost edge of\ndistrict 6, which is the outer edge of\nthe giant ring formed by the 10\ndistricts. Upon seeing this, Fong Yu\nsuddenly realized that the systems\nprediction of auspicious or ferocious\nbeasts would not likely occur in\ndistricts five and seven on the east and\nwest sides. It could only be the ancient\nbattlefield inside the giant ring or the\nunknown world outside the giant ring. As\nOlivia mentioned about the ancient\nbattlefield, it was just a desolate\npalace and corpses scattered all over\nthe mountains. Even if something did\nemerge, it was unlikely to be a mythical\nbeast. a ferocious beast would be more\nprobable. On his way to the lake, Fong\nYu encountered several other players\nheading in the same direction. It seemed\nthat news of the auspicious beast had\nalready spread, which troubled Fong Yu.\nThis meant that a chaotic battle might\nbreak out in the near future over the\ncapture of the auspicious beast. The\ninternal environment of District 6 is\nrelatively stable. Fongu was worried\nthat the competition for the auspicious\nbeasts would cause unnecessary\nconflicts. So he contacted Song Jimming\nin advance to inquire about the\nsituation of other forces in the\ndistrict besides Jun City. According to\nSong Jimming, the total number of people\nin this region is currently around\n7,800.\nThere are about 5,800 original players\nin King's Landing and 2,000 players who\ntransferred from the region. Song\nJimming has dispersed those transferred\nplayers into for settlements. Of the\n5,800 plus people in this region, more\nthan 4,600 have joined King's Landing,\nand only more than 1,200 have not yet\njoined. Most of these 1 200 plus people\nare players who prefer to play solo.\nThere is only one small group of about\n500 people called the Peach Blossom\nSociety. The leader is a female player\nwho has acquired druid skills. It is\nsaid that she found a very good place to\nlive. So she did not choose to join\nKing's Landing. Actually, Sanjing had\nmentioned this group to Fong Yu before\nasking if they wanted to go to Xiaoan.\nAt the time, Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s idea was that\nsince they didn't want to come, they\nshouldn't be forced as long as they\ndidn't cause trouble or affect the\nstability of the area. So, he didn't pay\nany attention to those people. It seems\nhighly likely that I'll run into those\ncasual players and members of the Peach\nBlossom Society. After Fongu led Olivia\nand Alpha through a forest, a large\nteardropshaped sapphire blue lake\nroughly the size of six football fields\nappeared before them. Hundreds of birds\nof various sizes circled on the lake,\nwhile herds of beasts stood or lay on\nits shore. Fongu took a closer look and\nsaw that among the birds of prey were\ngiant eagles and vultures, and among the\nbeasts were several tigers and\nrhinoceroses the size of trucks. But\nthese animals were all very calm, as if\nthey had lived together for many years.\nTwo clumsy wild boores in their playful\nchase bumped into a giant spotted\nleopard that was resting under a tree by\nthe lake. The leopard simply raised its\npaw to push the two impetuous boores\naside and went back to sleep. Several\nchirping sparrows descended from the sky\nand landed on the body of a giant\nblack-skaled python several meters long\nthat was swimming on the lake. These\nwere just a small corner that Fong Yu\nsaw. The same peculiar and peaceful\nscenes were unfolding in other parts of\nthe lake as well. Even after Fong Yu\nwalked out of the woods and approached\nthe lake, his previously agitated mood\nimmediately calmed down. After calming\ndown, he could vaguely hear a song that\nwas both ethereal and real, deep yet\nsoaring. Under the influence of this\nsong, his mood became even more\npeaceful. And he even had the idea of\nlying down on the ground to bask in the\nsun and then take a nap. In fact, at\nthis moment, hundreds of players were\nindeed lying on the mud flats all around\nthe lake, all with peaceful smiles,\nhappily basking in the sunlight. Not\nonly Fong Yu, but even Olivia, who is\nusually very vigilant, relaxed. Before\nhe knew it, Fong Yu had gradually\nforgotten the purpose of his visit. He\nturned to Olivia and said, \"Olivia, I\nthink the scenery here is quite nice.\nWhy don't we lie down here for a while?\nThat's exactly what I was thinking,\nmaster.\" So, Fong Yu and Olivia sat down\non the ground, and soon drowsiness\nappeared in their eyes as if they were\nabout to fall asleep at any moment. But\njust then, a furious bark suddenly rang\nin Fong Yu and Olivia's ears. Woof! The\nbark was like a demonic sound, causing\nFong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s eardrums and brain to\nache. But it was under this pain that\nFong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s mind quickly cleared. Fong\nYu shook his head, glanced at Alpha, who\nwas squatting beside him with clear\neyes, and then turned to look at Olivia,\nwhose eyes were also gradually waking\nup, and frowned. Whatever was hidden in\nthe lake, it had already alarmed Fong\nYu. Before we even met, Olivia and I had\nalready fallen into their trap. If Alpha\nhadn't helped us in time, we probably\nwould have fallen asleep. What on earth\nis going on? At this moment, Olivia\ntossed her long golden waves, pulled Fun\nYu up from the ground, and retreated\ninto the woods behind them. Only after\nthe two had retreated back into the\nwoods did Olivia say, \"Master, I think I\nknow what's hidden in this lake.\" Upon\nhearing this, Fong Yu immediately perked\nup and asked, \"What exactly is that\nthing? How could even you fall for it?\nThat must be a him mermaid. What the\nhell?\" Fongu didn't understand for a\nmoment. They are the mere folk who chant\nthe Holy Spirit song, Olivia explained.\nBeyond this continent lies the endless\nsea, inhabited by countless races, far\nmore numerous than those on land. Among\nthem are the Mare folk, who are born\nwith beautiful voices. The mare folk are\ndivided into many tribes due to\ndifferent living habits and beliefs. The\nholy song mare folk are one such tribe.\nThey worship the god of light and\nattract surrounding creatures by\nchanting holy songs, thus lowering the\nguard of their prey. The more aggressive\nthe creature, the greater the influence\nof the song. The less aggressive the\ncreature, the less affected it is. Fongu\nglanced at the drowsy tigers and\nleopards on the surrounding mud flats,\nthen looked at the hundreds of players\nwho had fallen into a deep sleep and\nsmiled helplessly, saying, \"They say\nhumans are the most brutal creatures,\nand now it seems that's absolutely\ntrue.\" But then Fongu remembered\nsomething. He glanced at Alpha and\nasked, \"Then why aren't you affected?\"\n\"Woof! Woof! Woof!\" Olivia explained to\nAlpha. Because the demon race is a race\npunished by the god of light and is not\nworthy of enjoying the baptism of the\nhymn. It cannot hear the sound of the\nhymn, so it is not affected. How could\nthis happen? Fongu said, both amused and\nexasperated. I never thought you'd\nactually benefit from this misfortune.\nBut then Fongu frowned and said, \"So\ndoes that mean we can't get close to\nthis lake and we won't be able to catch\nthat auspicious beast inside? Master,\nthe holy song may mar folk worship the\ngod of light and their allegiance is\ndifferent from ours. Olivia reminded us\nbesides even if we capture it, we don't\nhave anywhere to keep it. Just that\nlittle puddle in the backyard. These\nwords made Fongu realize something.\nIndeed, even if he captured the merman,\nwas he going to make it play that\nhypnotic song to lull him to sleep every\nday? That was completely unnecessary.\nWasn't Valentina's singing voice better\nthan its? Moreover, the small pond in\nthe backyard is indeed too small, let\nalone raising mermaids. It would\nprobably be difficult to even raise a\nslightly larger fish. But then, Fong Yu\nthought of another possibility and said,\n\"Do you think it's possible that the\nauspicious beast wasn't actually the\nholy song mermaid?\" \"What do you mean?\"\nOlivia asked. \"Think about it. It's just\na mermaid. Although it can sing hymns,\nit shouldn't be considered a mythical\nbeast, right? Besides, mermaids should\nbe considered a subhuman race. So, how\ncan they be considered beasts? That\nseems to make sense. Therefore, I\nsuspect that this merman might just be a\nguardian protecting the real auspicious\nbeast. But these are all just guesses.\nHow can we prove them? Fongu then turned\nbewildered and laughed. Brother, it's\ntime for you to shine. Alpha. Chapter\n165. The egg of Leviathan. Finally,\nunder Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s patient persuasion,\nthe dog took small steps toward the lake\nand soon dived into the water. Fong\nYu&lt;unk&gt;s task for him was to go to the\nbottom of the lake and see if there was\nanything else besides the him fishmen.\nIf there was, he would have Olivia go\nback and bring the zombie army since the\nzombie army had no souls and would not\nbe affected by the him. He could then\nhave the zombie army sweep through the\nbottom of the lake. At worst, as long as\nthey could interrupt the Him Fishman\nsong, he and Olivia could move.\nFortunately, he had absorbed the power\nof the water dragon heart last night and\nhad gained the ability to breathe\nunderwater, so fighting underwater\nwouldn't be a big problem. 5 minutes\nlater, the singing that had been\nlingering by the lake suddenly stopped,\nand soon Alpha's head emerged from the\nwater. Bubbles began to rise from the\nlake, and then a huge fish fin appeared\nbehind Alpha. The length of its fins is\neven greater than Alpha's body. It's\nhard to imagine just how big the fish\nunderwater really is. \"Holy crap,\" Fong\nYu exclaimed, his eyes wide. \"There\nreally is something else in the water.\"\nImmediately, Fong Yu rushed to the\nlakeside and instantly unleashed two\nwind blades, which flew towards the fish\nfin behind Alpha. Just as the giant fin\nwas about to approach Alpha, Fong Yu's\nwind blade successfully struck the fin.\nTo Fong Yu's surprise, the sharp windb\nblade failed to cut through the\nseemingly thin fin, only making two\nshallow cuts on its surface. However,\nthe windblade attack seemed to have hurt\nthe fish. Its injured fin quickly\nsubmerged to the bottom of the water,\ncircled once, and then swam towards\nAlpha again. After Fongu realized that\nhis wind blades could not cause fatal\ndamage to the giant fish, he immediately\nreleased wind dance on Alpha. With a\nstrong gust of wind, waves were stirred\nup on the lake surface, and Alpha's body\nwas successfully lifted into the air by\nwind dance and flew towards the lake. At\nthat moment, the giant fish at the\nbottom of the water suddenly leaped out\nof the water and opened its huge mouth\nfull of sharp teeth, biting at Alpha in\nmidair. Only then did Fong Yu finally\nsee what the fish looked like. \"Holy\ncrap, a shark,\" Fong Yu exclaimed in\nshock. \"Why would there be a shark in\nthe lake? That's so illogical. Seeing\nthat Alpha's body was already engulfed\nby the giant shark's mouth, Fongu could\nonly quickly change the angle of his\nwind dance flight, allowing Alpha s body\nto narrowly escape the giant shark's\nmouth. Finally, after the giant shark\nmissed its bite, Alpha was successfully\nrescued by Fong Yu using the dance of\nthe wind and brought back to shore,\nwhere Fong Yu hugged him tightly. \"That\nscared me to death.\" Fong Yu put the dog\ndown on the ground, carefully examined\nits entire body, and only after\nconfirming that it was not injured did\nhe ask, \"So besides that fishman and\nthat giant shark, was there anything\nelse in the water?\" After shaking off\nits wet yellow fur, Alpha suddenly\ngrinned and spat out a perfectly round\nmulticolored ball at Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s feet.\nHuh? What is this? Fong Yu picked up the\nround ball about the size of a pingpong\nball from beside his feet. Leviathan's\negg, guardian of the ocean. Purple epic\nLeviathans are colossal sea monsters,\npowerful beings of the endless sea. Due\nto their gentle nature, they are revered\nas guardian deities by many sea races.\nThey typically reside among these races,\nguarding their territories. Adult\nLeviathans exceed 1,000 m in length and\nare rarely rivaled in the ocean. If I'm\nnot mistaken, this Leviathan egg should\nbe the auspicious beast of this area,\nright? But this thing doesn't seem to\nwork on me. We haven't even finished\ndealing with things on our own land. And\nwe haven't even unified the 10 regions\nyet. What's the point of having this\nthing? Moreover, the pond in their own\nyard is so small that it's barely big\nenough to raise Leviathans, let alone\nfish. Sigh. I originally thought I could\nget a powerful auspicious beast like a\ngiant dragon to improve my combat power\nor at least a land dragon like Li\nChunlong as a mount. Just as Fong Yu was\ncomplaining in his heart, the lake water\nbegan to churn again. Fong Yu naturally\nnoticed the commotion on the lake. He\nturned his head and saw the huge shark\nemerge from the water with two slender\nfigures standing on its massive smooth\nback. One was a merman covered in blue\nscales wearing a long dress woven from\nscallops and seaweed and holding a conch\nshell staff. The other was an ordinary\nhuman woman wearing a green dress. The\nhuman woman in green said something to\nthe blue merman beside her. The blue\nmerman nodded, waved his staff, and a\nstream of water carried the woman in\ngreen to the shore. After the woman in\nthe green dress reached the shore, she\nhurriedly ran towards Fong Yu. Seeing\nthis, Olivia, who was beside Fong Yu,\ntook out an iron axe from behind her\nback. Don't panic. Fong Yu raised his\nhand and waved to Olivia, saying, \"Let's\nsee what she's up to first.\" At this\nmoment, the woman in the green dress\napproached Fong Yu and said sincerely,\n\"Excuse me, could you return the\noffspring of the ocean guardian to\nNata?\" \"Who is Niata?\" Fongu raised an\neyebrow and asked calmly. The girl in\nthe green dress pointed to the blue\nmerman on the giant shark's back and\nsaid, \"Nata is the princess of the holy\nsong merman race. Her kingdom has been\ninvaded by enemies, and she must rely on\nthe offspring of the ocean guardian god\nto save her tribe.\" As she spoke, the\ngirl in the green dress bowed deeply to\nFongu. Seeing the girl in front of him\nlower herself so much, Fong Yu swallowed\nback the arrogant and unreasonable lines\nhe had prepared in advance. Finally,\nFong Yu asked in a slightly more\nconsiliatory tone, \"And who are you?\"\nThe girl in the green dress blinked her\nbright, lively eyes and replied, \"My\nname isQing Ning Shining Ning.\" Shining\nNing Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s lips curled slightly\nas he smiled and said, \"Who gave you\nthis name? Why not Shin Mango?\" Huh?\nShining Ning was taken aback for a\nmoment, then realized what she meant and\nexplained. It's Ching for fresh and\nelegant, and Ning for peaceful and\nserene. Oh, I see. Fong Yu raised an\neyebrow again, then shook the Leviathan\negg in his hand and said, \"You mean this\nthing?\" Shining nodded repeatedly when\nshe saw the Leviathan egg in Fong\nYu&lt;unk&gt;s hand, saying, \"Yes, that's it.\nCan you return it to Nayata? Give it\nback to her.\" Fong Yu said, toying with\nthe Leviathan egg in his hand with great\ninterest. What makes you think this\nthing is hers? All I know is that my dog\nbrought it to me. Upon hearing this,\nShining Ming immediately exclaimed, \"But\nthis ocean guardian egg was stolen by\nthis dog while I was talking to Nata\nafter it dived to the bottom of the\nlake.\" \"What evidence do you have to\nprove it?\" This Shining Ning was\nspeechless for a moment. Were there any\ncameras here? Where was there any\nevidence to prove it? Finally, Shinshing\nMing could only stomp her foot in\nfrustration and say, \"Can't you be\nreasonable? Stealing is wrong.\" Looking\nat the silly looking girl in front of\nhim, Fong Yu couldn't help but laugh.\nLooking at Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s beaming face,\nShuning Ming asked angrily, \"What are\nyou laughing at?\" Fong Yu finally\nstopped laughing, cleared his throat,\nand said, \"You want to be reasonable,\nright? Then let me ask you, where is\nthis place?\" \"Um, I'm asking you, is\nthis land?\" Shinqing nodded. So, is this\narea District 6? Shuning nodded again.\nYou're&lt;unk&gt; a player, right? Shinqing\ncontinued to nod. Then, let me ask you,\nin these six districts, who holds the\nhighest position? Who is most qualified\nto allocate resources and land? This\none? I'm just asking you, are you a\nlord? Fongu pressed aggressively.\nShinshing Ning could only nod silently\nonce again. Then, do you know who I am?\nFong Yu asked, pointing to his nose.\nShinqing suddenly realized and said,\n\"Oh, could it be that you are Lord\nSanjming,\" \"No.\" Fong Yu shook his\nfinger and said calmly, \"That guy is\njust my underling. Remember, my name is\nFong Yu. Fong as in square and round.\nYou as in universe.\" Shinqing. Fong Yu\nthen pointed to the Leviathan egg in his\nhand and asked, \"Since you also know\nthat the Lord of this area is the most\npowerful, and the Lord is my\nsubordinate, then tell me, who should\nthis thing belong to?\" After being led\nastray by Fong Yu, the girl in the green\ndress was stunned for a long time before\nfinally realizing what was happening,\nshe glared at Fong Yu and said, \"I\nunderstand. You don't want to return\nthis to Nata, do you?\" Fong Yu slapped\nhis forehead, took a deep breath, and\nsighed helplessly. Little sister, just\nhow long is your reaction time? Chapter\n166. Lee Chun Long of Chong Shan is\nhere. Dare to fight? Fongu had never met\nsuch an adorable and clueless girl\nbefore. He had been trying to fool her\nfor a long time before she finally\nrealized what he was doing, which made\nit impossible for Fong Yu to get angry.\n\"All right, all right. I'm not teasing\nyou anymore.\" Fong Yu waved the\nLeviathan egg in his hand and said, \"I\ncan give this thing back to her, but you\nshould ask her if she should give me\nsomething in return to express.\"\nShinqing asked, puzzled, \"What do you\nmean by expressing hiss?\" Fu realized he\ncouldn't beat around the bush with this\ngirl because she didn't understand the\nconcept of twisting things. \"This merman\ncame to my territory without a word and\neven knocked out so many people. I\nalmost fell for her trick,\" Funu said\nirritably. Now she wants to take this\nback. Do you think she should offer\nsomething of equal value in exchange?\nShuning Ming understood Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s\nmeaning. After hesitating for a moment,\nshe turned back to the shore and\nchattered in a strange language with the\nmerman on the giant shark. Holy crap.\nFunu was astonished by this sight. I\ndidn't expect this girl to speak mermaid\nlanguage. At this moment, Olivia\nexplained, \"This girl should be a druid.\nThat is a nature mage who worships the\ngod of nature. Being fluent in the\nlanguages of all races is a druid's\ninnate skill. Druid, Fongu murmured,\nthen suddenly remembered that earlier\nthere seemed to be a girl in this area\nwho had saved a bird and then received\nthe druids legacy. Fongu had envied her\nfor quite a while back then. So, this\nwas the girl in front of him. At this\nmoment, Shinqing Ning finished\ncommunicating with the merman on the\ngiant shark. The merman mage waved his\nstaff and a stream of clear water\ncarried her to the land where she landed\nin front of Fong Yu. Immediately, the\nmerman spoke to Fong Yu in the\ncontinent's common language, which\nsounded somewhat strange. Your\nExcellency, Lord, Lord, it is our fault\nthat we have come here without informing\nyou. It is also our unavoidable mistake\nto have your people fall asleep by\nreciting hymns so abruptly. We hope you\nwill forgive us.\" As he spoke, the\nmerman mage took out a bead that\nshimmerred with blue light and presented\nit to Fong Yu, saying, \"This is the\ntreasure of our Merman clan, the Azure\nSea Pearl. It is offered to you as a\ntribute to show our respect for your\npower and status. We hope that you will\nallow us to stay here temporarily and\nreturn the offspring of the guardian\ndeity.\" As he spoke, the merman mage\nbowed deeply to Fong Yu. Seeing the\nmermaid mage's humble attitude, and\nconsidering that he really didn't have a\nplace to keep this Leviathan, which was\nsaid to grow to 1,000 m long, Fong Yu\nhanded over the Leviathan egg and said\nindifferently. Since you're so\nunderstanding, I'll give it back to you.\nSo, Fong Yu and the merman mage\nexchanged the items they were holding.\nAzure Sea Pearl, a precious pearl formed\nby mages of the mare folk rank of archm\nor higher using their own magic power.\nIt can store 200 points of mana and can\nalso be fused in a magical items.\nWearing it will earn the respect of the\nmare folk. Thank you, Lord. The merman\nmage, who is also Princess Nayata of the\nHoly Clan, bowed to Fong Yu again and\nsaid, \"Once the offspring of the\nguardian god hatches, we will return to\nthe endless sea.\" Fong you put away that\nsanghai pearl and smiled slightly.\nYou're too kind, but I'm a little\ncurious. How did you get to this lake?\nThe mermaid princess pointed to the lake\nand said, \"There is a tunnel at the\nbottom of this lake that leads to the\nendless sea. We came from this tunnel.\nThen why don't you hatch your guardian\nspirits in your own territory instead of\ncoming to the lakes on land?\" Because\nNata hesitated for a moment, but decided\nto tell the truth. My uncle launched a\ncoup. killed my father, imprisoned my\nmother, and I had no choice but to flee\nhere with the children of the guardian\ndeity. I see, Fong Yu suddenly realized.\nHe had originally thought that the Mar\nfolk would be a peaceful race, but now\nit seemed that no race that was related\nto humans was easy to deal with. No\nwonder the god of light said that he\nwanted to purify the entire world, not\njust the people on a particular\ncontinent. Oh, what a tragedy. In that\ncase, you can stay here peacefully. I'll\ntell the people nearby not to bother\nyou, Fongu said. In that case, thank you\nvery much. So, the mermana returned to\nthe lake with the Leviathan egg, said\ngoodbye to Shun Ching Ning, and then\ndived into the lake bottom with the\ngiant shark. At this moment, the animals\nby the lake dispersed, and the players\nwho had been sleeping by the lake woke\nup one by one. When they saw Fong Yu and\nShin Ching Ning, they all gathered\naround them. A burly male player barked\nat Fong Yu in a rough voice. What did\nthat merman say to you? What benefits\ndid he give you? Upon hearing this, Fong\nYu glanced at the male player and said\ncoldly, \"What's it to you?\" \"Huh, kid,\nyou're asking for a beating, aren't\nyou?\" Seeing Fong Yu's thin and weak\nappearance, the male player pulled out a\ntwo-handed great sword from his backpack\nand threatened. \"We're&lt;unk&gt; all here to\nfind the auspicious beast. Did that\nmerman just give you the auspicious\nbeast? If you know what's good for you,\nhand it over. Yes, hand it over. The\nother players nearby shouted in unison.\nEveryone who sees it gets a share. Upon\nhearing this, Fongu chuckled. He smiled\nslightly, pointed to himself, and said,\n\"Do you know who I am? I don't care who\nyou are. Hand over the mythical beast\nright now, or believe me, I'll beat you\nto death.\" The male player wielding the\ntwo-handed greats sword glared at Fong\nYu and threatened him, seemingly very\nconfident in his strength. Just then, a\nterrifying roar rang out from the dense\nforest beside them, and a ferocious\nEarth dragon rushed out of the forest\nand charged towards them, scaring them\ninto retreating to a distance. When the\nEarth Dragon came to a distance from\nFong Yu, it suddenly stopped. Li Chan\nLong, fully armed, jumped off the earth\ndragon's back, ran to Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s\nside, took off his helmet, and smiled at\nFong Yu, \"Boss, I'm here.\" Fong Yu\nglanced at Lie Chun Long and said\nindifferently, \"If you had come any\nlater, I probably would have been beaten\nto death.\" \"Huh?\" Upon hearing this, Lie\nChunl&lt;unk&gt;s eyebrows shot up, and he\nshouted, \"Who's so bold? How dare they\nlay a hand on you, boss?\" Fong Yu\npointed at the male player wielding a\ntwo-handed sword and said, \"Hey, that's\nhim.\" He said, \"If I don't hand over the\nauspicious beast, he'll beat me to\ndeath. What do you think I should do?\"\nLiechon Long turned to look at the male\nplayer who was standing there in a days,\nput on the helmet in his hand, and said,\n\"Understood. Leave it to me.\" After\nsaying that, Lie Chun Long took out his\ndragon rider spear from his backpack,\npointed it at the two-handed sword\nplayer, and shouted, \"Lie Chun Long of\nChong Shan is here. Dare to fight.\"\nChapter 167. Don't take our tolerance\nfor granted as a license to be arrogant.\nAt this moment, looking at Li Chun Long\nstanding with his gun at the ready and\nhearing his words, Lie Chun Long of\nChong Shan is here, Fong Yu finally\nunderstood why he had founded the Three\nKingdoms Heroes Gathering. To be honest,\nthis posture really does resemble the\nheroic appearance of Xiao Xeong rescuing\na dough during the Battle of Chong Ban.\nNo, wouldn't that make me a fool? Fong\nYu shook his head and gave a\nself-deprecating laugh. At this moment,\nthe male player wielding the two-handed\nsword upon seeing Lie Chunlongs stance\nand the nearly 10 meter long menacing\nEarth dragon beside him lost his\nprevious swagger and hurriedly\nretreated, explaining, \"It's all a\nmisunderstanding.\" Apart from this male\nplayer, the other players who had been\negging him on also fell silent and dared\nnot utter another sound. It seems like\nthis fight won't happen. Fong Yu then\nstepped forward and pressed down on the\ndragon spear in Li Chunlong&lt;unk&gt;s hand,\nsaying, \"All right, put it down.\" Upon\nhearing this, Li Chin Long put away his\nspear, but still glared fiercely at the\ngroup of players, making them tremble\nwith fear and dare not move. Fongu\nglanced at the rabble and said calmly,\n\"You may not know me, but you should\nhave all heard of my name. My name is\nFongu. I know you are all solo players\nwho are unwilling to submit to King's\nLanding. I don't object to your own\nideas, and I won't force you to join.\nBut there is one thing I must solemnly\ndeclare. I hope for harmony and\nstability within server 6. If I find\nanyone again who dares to bully others\nat will just because they think they are\nsuperior in strength, then don't blame\nme for being ruthless. Perhaps you think\nI'm just bluffing. Or perhaps you don't\nknow my strength yet. Well, then I'll\nshow you something now. Take a look at\nthe chat channel. After saying that,\nFong Yu posted his honor points on the\npublic chat channel of District 6. Fong\nYu ID00006\ncurrent honor points 4421. The players\nall opened the area chat channel, but\nwhen they saw Fong Yu's honor points,\neveryone exclaimed in surprise. Even Lee\nChun Long showed a shocked expression.\nHe knew that Fong Yu had killed a lot of\nplayers from other regions in the past\ntwo days in regions 5 and 7, but he did\nnot expect that he had killed so many.\nHoly crap, 4,421\npoints. This guy actually killed 4,421\npeople. Not necessarily. It said that\nyou get double the honor points for\nkilling players from other regions.\nThat's at least 2,000 people killed. My\ngod, is this even human? This is\nterrifying. He must be a monster. a\ndevil. I think he's more like a demon\nking. Hearing the murmurss from the\ncrowd, Fongu snorted coldly, silencing\nthe noise, and said again, \"So, you\nshould know now that I'm not some kind\nof saint. Don't mistake my leniency for\nyour own insulence.\"\nThe crowd fell silent. No one dared to\nraise a single objection to Fong\nYu&lt;unk&gt;s words. Fong Yu continued, \"I\nwill have Song Jimming formulate a new\nset of regulations for the entire\ndistrict, specifically targeting those\nwho commit wrongdoings. Once discovered,\nthey will be severely punished. As the\nsaying goes, in times of chaos, harsh\nmeasures are necessary. At present, the\nplayer community is not subject to any\nlegal constraints, and there are too\nmany people who act recklessly. If this\ncontinues, the internal strife will be\ntoo serious.\" According to Song Jummings\nincomplete statistics, more than 70% of\nthe player casualties in zone 6 were due\nto player versus player combat. And the\nactual number of players who died in the\nwild was not very large. Therefore, in\norder to rebuild civilization in this\nperilous alien world, it is necessary to\nestablish a law through ruthless means\nto once again lock up the beasts that\nrun rampant in people's hearts. At this\npoint, Fong Yu pointed to the lake next\nto him and said, \"Also, no one is\nallowed to disturb the mayor folk in\nthis lake anymore. Anyone who disagrees\ncan step forward now.\" Looking at the\nsilent crowd, Fongu nodded and said,\n\"Very good. Since no one is\ndissatisfied, let's disperse.\" As a\nresult, the players felt as if they had\nbeen granted a pardon and turned around\nand fled the place. At this moment, Lie\nChunlong came up and asked, \"Boss, is\nthat all? Otherwise, what? You really\nwant to kill a few people to establish\nyour authority? Not really. All right.\nThank you for coming all this way, Fongu\nsaid. If you really want to fight, I'll\ngive you your chance tonight. Huh?\nTonight? Li Chun Long was taken aback,\nthen asked excitedly. Where are their\nfights tonight? Tonight, you will select\n200 elite players to come with me to\nDistrict 7. Li Chun Long suddenly\nrealized and said, \"I remember now.\"\nSong Jimming said that district 7 will\nbe merged into our district tomorrow.\nFong Yu nodded and said, \"Yes, but there\nare still some stubborn guys in district\n7, so we have to deal with them\ntonight.\" Understood? Lie Chun Long\nnodded repeatedly and said, \"I'll go\nback and prepare now.\" After saying\nthat, Li Chunlong stepped onto the\ndragon's back using its front claws and\ncharged back in the direction he had\ncome from. Watching Lie Chunlong&lt;unk&gt;s\ndeparting figure, Fong Yu smiled and\nsaid, \"His temperament is more like\nJangida than Xiao Xilong.\" After Lie\nChunlong left, Fongu was about to take\nOlivia and Alpha back to the manor when\nShinqing Ning, the girl in the green\ndress, came over again. \"Wait a minute,\"\nShining Ning called out to Fong Yu.\n\"What is it?\" Fong Yu asked somewhat\nsurprised. \"Are you really Fong Yu?\"\nFong Yu replied irritably. You look like\nyou're 17 or 18 years old, but the\nthings you say and the questions you ask\nsound like a 3 or 4year-old. I already\nposted my message in the regional chat\nchannel. Didn't you see it? I've seen\nit. Shinqing nodded and said somewhat\nhastily. That's why I came to find you.\nI want to tell you something. What's\nwrong? Fongu replied irritably. I'm in a\nhurry, little girl. So Shinshing Ning\ntook a deep breath, looked up at Fong\nYu, and said firmly. Can you please stop\nkilling people? Huh? Fongu was confused.\nHe picked at his ear and asked again,\nwhat did you say? I'm telling you, can\nyou please stop killing? You've\ncommitted too many atrocities. This is\nwrong. Fongu suddenly felt it was\nabsurd. In such a cruel world of\nsurvival, everyone is struggling to\nsurvive and often they have to face life\nor death situations. But this girl in\nfront of him actually told him not to\nkill anymore. And then what? wait for\nsomeone else to come and kill me. Is\nthis girl out of her mind? Neuropathy.\nAfter uttering those three words, Fong\nYu didn't bother with the strange girl\nanymore and turned to leave with Olivia\nand Alpha in the direction of the manor.\nShinqing watched Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s departing\nfigure, bit her lip, stomped her foot,\nand shouted at Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s back.\nYou'll get yourself killed like this.\nUpon hearing this, Fong Yu paused\nslightly, then turned to the girl and\nsneered. Those kinds of thoughts will\nonly kill you. With that, Fong Yu walked\nstraight into the dense forest without\nstopping. Fongu knew the girl meant no\nharm. At most, she was just naive and\ninnocent, or perhaps a bit of a saint.\nHe didn't quite understand how someone\nwith that personality could survive in\nthis perilous world of survival. Perhaps\nit was because she was lucky. Perhaps it\nwas because she had never encountered a\nreal life or death crisis. If she were\nto encounter a psychopathic killer like\nWu Fong Lang, whom Fongu had met before,\nor the invading forces from districts 5\nand 7, given her personality, her fate\nwould likely be dire. At that moment,\nOlivia, who was walking beside her,\nsuddenly said, \"If everyone thought like\nher, perhaps there would be no conflict\nin this world. In that case, perhaps we\ncould win the bet between the god of\ndarkness and the god of light.\" Fongu\nwas slightly takenback upon hearing\nthis. He opened his mouth as if to\nrefute something, but swallowed the\nwords that were on the tip of his tongue\nand finally let out a sigh. He suddenly\nremembered his sentence. When filth\nbecomes the norm, innocence becomes a\nkind of original sin. The girl's idea\nwas actually quite good. It's just that\nthe world isn't all that wonderful.\nChapter 168. What kind of dragon is Le\nYunong? Ideals are often lofty, but\nreality is always harsh. Although Fong\nYu also hoped that everyone could be as\ninnocent as the girl in the green dress,\nhe knew that was impossible. Just as he\nknew, it was impossible to establish a\npeaceful and stable society according to\nthe wager between the god of light and\nthe god of darkness. Therefore, he could\nonly follow the established plan and\nseek an opportunity to defeat the god of\nlight in order to bring a glimmer of\nhope for himself and for other living\nbeings in this world. Back at the manor,\nFong Yu, who was starving, smelled the\naroma of food coming from the house.\nUpon entering, he found a table laden\nwith dishes, including a considerable\namount of seafood. Sonata Sauari was\ncarrying a plate of sashimi from the\nkitchen. Uh, you've come at just the\nright time, Sonata Sari said with a\nsmile. So, please enjoy. M, it smells\ndelicious. But where did you get all\nthis abalone and sushimi? Funu asked,\nglancing at the seafood on the table as\nhe sat down. I exchanged them with\nplayers in zone 5 at the exchange. They\nhave a natural harbor there with\nabundant seafood at reasonable prices,\nso I bought some,\" Sonata replied. Funu\npicked up his chopsticks, took a bite of\nsushi, and exclaimed, \"Hm, not bad. Not\nbad. Your skills are pretty good.\"\nSonata Sari smiled sweetly, and said, \"I\nused to help out at my uncle's\nrestaurant, so I learned a few things.\"\nAnd so, lunch began pleasantly. During\nlunch, Song Jimming sent a message,\nmainly replying to Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s\nquestion about legislation for District\n6 that morning. In fact, this question\nhad been raised during the first\ndiscussion meeting. But after all, there\nare too many and complicated things to\ninclude and consider in legislation. So\nafter so many days, only a rough draft\nof the bill has been formed. This is\neven with a large number of original\nworld legal documents available for\nreference. Otherwise, revising a bill\nwould likely take 3 to 500 days to\ncomplete. Fonu glanced at the draft bill\nsent by Sanjing. It was basically the\nsame as the bill in the original world,\nbut the punishment for violations was\nincreased. As the saying goes, in times\nof chaos, severe punishments are\nnecessary. Funu agreed with this change.\nThe foundation for a society to function\nstably is the law. Only under the\nconstraints of the law can the dark side\nof human nature be restrained to the\ngreatest extent. This is why Fong Yu\nproposed revising the law as soon as\npossible. In fact, the initial draft of\nthe bill was over 100,000 words long,\nand that was after repeated\nsimplification. Fong Yu only read it for\nless than 10 minutes before feeling\ndizzy and unable to continue reading.\nSo, he decided to take a shortcut and\nreplied directly to Song Jimming. The\nreview is your responsibility. Remember,\nthere is only one principle. Do your\nbest to be fair and impartial. eliminate\nany loopholes for favoritism or\ncorruption and especially increase the\npunishment for those who knowingly break\nthe law. After thinking for a moment,\nFongu replied, \"In addition, prepare\nanother batch of management personnel. I\nwill send Sonata Sari, the lord of\ndistrict 7, to meet with you after\ndistrict 7 is merged tomorrow. Try your\nbest to cooperate with her to arrest the\nmanagement personnel of District 7.\"\nSoon, Sun Jumming sent a message saying\nthat he had received it and would\ndefinitely carry it out seriously. Fong\nYu actually quite approves of Fatty\nSongs abilities. He can usually complete\nthe tasks assigned to him smoothly. The\nonly drawback might be his low combat\nstrength. Although he is now immortal,\nFong Yu still decided to strengthen the\nprotective forces around him just in\ncase. After all, decapitation strikes\naren't Fong Yu's exclusive domain. He\nbeheaded the lord of district 7 last\nnight and the news should soon reach the\nears of other district lords. It's hard\nto guarantee they won't follow suit and\ncarry out a decapitation strike as well.\nLieong was originally capable of this\ntask, but district 7 will be merged\ntomorrow and Lee Shinlong needs to lead\nhis troops to District 7 to guard it for\na period of time to prevent villains\nfrom causing trouble, which would leave\nKing's Landing's defenses vulnerable.\nBut who should be sent to protect Fatty\nSong? That's the question. Alfa's\nstrengths lie in reconnaissance and\nambush, making him unsuitable as a\nbodyguard. While Olivia would be a good\nfit, Fun would need to take her on many\nother tasks. As for Valentina, she is\neven less suitable as she has almost no\ncombat ability during the day since she\nhasn't fully recovered her physical\nbody. Therefore, it seems there is only\none suitable candidate, that's Sonata\nSari. So after dinner, Fong Yu explained\nto Sonata Sari that he wanted her to go\nto King's Landing to meet up with Song\nJumming, learn some management skills\nfrom him and also take care of\nprotecting him for a few days. Sari, who\nwas clearing the table, was slightly\ntaken aback when she heard Fong Yu's\narrangement. She glanced at Fong Yu, but\ndidn't say anything. She just nodded and\ntook the plates to the kitchen. Seeing\nthis, Olivia raised her eyebrows\nslightly, wanting to say something, but\nshe didn't. She felt a little sorry for\nSonata Sari because her master didn't\nseem to realize Saur's feelings for him.\nBut at the same time, Olivia breathed a\nslight sigh of relief. As for the\nreason, well, it was just a woman's\nlittle thought. Alfa, who had just\nfinished eating the octopus sushimi made\nby Sonata Sour, sighed slightly, jumped\noff the chair, and returned to his dog\nhouse, thinking to himself that it was a\nreal pity that he had only eaten this\ndelicious fresh sushimi once. and there\nwould be no next meal. After a short\nrest, Fong Yu asked Olivia to help take\nSonata Sari to King&lt;unk&gt;s Landing while\nhe himself took Alpha and 20 roasted\npigs to the dragon's lair. Although the\nfirst meeting with the dragon named Odum\nwas not pleasant, the second\nconversation in the dragon's lair\nchanged Fong Yuse and the dragons\nperception of each other considerably.\nAt least, it doesn't have to be a life\nor death struggle. As for whether or not\nto avenge the 10 ghosts in the mine in\norder to gain their permanent loyalty,\nFunu didn't really care. After all, he\nnow has a large number of zombie miners,\nwhich has greatly improved his mining\nefficiency. Most importantly, the risks\nand rewards are disproportionate.\nRisking one's life to hunt a dragon just\nfor 10 ghosts. Stop kidding me. Wouldn't\nit be better if I just befriended this\ndragon and formed an alliance with it?\nAs for what to do with those 10 ghosts,\nwhen we have time, we can take their\nremains back to the cemetery next to\nYorktown and bury them there. As for the\nminor issue of digging up their\ntombstones, we can just make a few more\nlater. In short, he will never be led by\nthe nose by the game system or game\ncharacters, and he will think about and\nexecute everything from an objective and\noptimal perspective. A moment later,\nFong Yu brought the roasted wild boar\nmeat back to the dragon's lair on the\nsouthern mountain, and the giant dragon\nOdum slowly emerged after sensing Fong\nYu&lt;unk&gt;s presence. Yes, you finally\narrived. I've been waiting for you for a\nlong time. Did you bring that delicious\nroast pig from last time? Odum asked as\nhe approached Fong Yu. Of course, Fong\nYu waved his hand, and 20 roasted pigs\nappeared on the ground. Upon seeing the\nroasted pig, Odum's enormous dragon eyes\nflashed with joy. He lowered his head,\nbit into one of the pigs, and swallowed\nit whole. \"By the way, there's something\nI've been wanting to ask you,\" Fu said\nto Odum. \"What is it?\" Odum replied,\nchewing on a crunchy piece of roasted\npork. \"The town where we first met was\nsaid to have been destroyed by a giant\ndragon many years ago.\" \"I know. Was it\nyou?\" Funu asked. He still wanted to\nknow why the dragon destroyed the former\nYorktown. If he couldn't find a reason\nthat Fong Yu could accept, he would kill\nthe dragon if he had the chance in the\nfuture. Upon hearing this, Odum looked\nat Fong Yu with his amber gold eyes and\nthen said frankly, \"That's right. I\ndestroyed it.\" Upon hearing this, Fongu\nraised an eyebrow slightly and asked,\n\"Then can you tell me why you destroyed\nthat town? Was it just to eat the humans\ninside?\" Odum swallowed the roasted pig\nin his mouth and said, \"No, actually, I\ndon't like eating people. Human flesh\ntastes too fishy and sour. It makes me\nnauseous. The reason I destroyed that\ntown is because a plague broke out\nthere. A terrible plague. Plague?\" Fongu\nfrowned, his raised eyebrows furrowing.\n\"Yes!\" Odum nodded. \"It seems to be a\nnecromancer's toxin that leaked out for\nsome reason, infecting the entire town's\npopulation. What's worse, the toxin can\ninfect not only humans, but also almost\nall creatures except dragons, turning\nthem into undead. So, to prevent the\nplague from killing all life on the\nisland, I destroyed the city and burned\nall the infected humans inside. I see.\nFong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s furrowed brows relaxed,\nand the coldness in his eyes\ndisappeared. He knew about the\nnecromancer. He was hiding in the\ncemetery outside Yorktown, but Valentina\nhad already devoured him, and it\nprobably wasn't a toxin leak. The\nnecromancer wanted to infect the people\nof Yorktown and create an army of the\nundead. Therefore, the dragon's words\nare probably true. If the dragon\ndestroyed Yorktown to stop the spread of\nthe undead plague, then to be honest,\nFunu could understand this action very\nwell. If it were him, he would probably\ndo the same. When there is no cure for\nthe plague, the only way is to stop its\nspread. Therefore, it is understandable\nthat Odum chose to kill those infected\nhumans. After learning the whole story,\nFong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s dislike for Odum lessened\nconsiderably. Then there's no need for\nme to kill this dragon. I wonder if\ntelling Steve and his ghost miners about\nthis situation will make them give up\nthe idea of killing the dragon. At this\nmoment, Odum said again, I admire your\ncourage, human boy, but honestly, it's\ncompletely impossible for you to defeat\nthe god of light. Odum used his forpaw\nto hook another roasted pig and toss it\ninto his mouth, chewing as he said,\n\"This area you're in is actually a huge\nisland, and it was the final battlefield\nof the last thousand-year wager.\" Olivia\nLane, the ruler, had a million strong\nundead army which was slaughtered by the\nangels under the throne of the god of\nlight in the ancient battlefield in the\ncentral ring area of the island. So I\nsuggest you don't waste your time just\nlike me. Enjoy this last thousand years\nand then die peacefully. Fongu smiled\nfaintly and said, \"Have you ever heard\nof the spirit of bright sword?\" \"What?\"\nThe dragon was slightly takenback. Fong\nYu glanced at the clouds on the horizon\nand recalled Li Yun Long once said that\nwhen encountering the enemy on a narrow\npath, no matter how strong the enemy is,\neven if you know you are no match, you\nmust still draw your sword. Even if you\ndie in battle, you should never\nsurrender. Even in defeat, you will be\nhonorable. This is the spirit of bright\nsword. After listening, the dragon's\neyes lit up slightly. After a long\nsilence, it nodded, a hint of reverence\nin its eyes, and asked, \"What kind of\ndragon is Le Yun Long, and where is he\nfrom?\" \"Fong Yu.\" Chapter 1 169\nDecapitation Operation versus\nDecapitation Operation in order to\nexplain to the Dragon Odum who Li Yun\nLong was. Fong Yu had no choice but to\ntell it the story of the independent\nregiment of the 386th Brigade.\nUnexpectedly, Odum got more and more\nexcited as it listened and insisted on\npulling Fong Yu to continue. So, Fong Yu\nhad no choice but to slap his thigh and\nstart telling the story of how Commander\nLee rose to power. This story begins in\na place called Ping and County. 2 hours\nlater, Fong Yu, whose throat was from\ntalking, could no longer continue. He\nwaved to Odum, who was lying on the\nground listening intently, and said, \"I\ncan't go on anymore. My throat isoaro.\nLet's stop here for today. I have to go\nback now. I have things to do tonight.\nUh Odum reluctantly raised its huge head\nand shook it, saying that Yamamoto is\nreally despicable. He actually kidnapped\nLi Yun&lt;unk&gt;s lover. He's shameless. As\nhe spoke, the dragon breathed a beam of\nscorching flame into the sky, startling\nFong Yu. But then Odum lowered his head\nand asked curiously, \"So Leun must have\nrescued his lover, Shioin, from\nYamamoto's clutches later, right?\" He\nFunu chuckled awkwardly. \"I can't&lt;unk&gt;t\ngive away any spoilers, otherwise it\nwon't be fun. I'll continue the story\nwith you tomorrow. It's about the\nItalian cannon and Shoqin.\" After saying\nthat, Fong Yu immediately performed a\nwind dance and flew down the mountain.\nWatching Fong Yu disappear at the foot\nof the mountain, Odum smoothed the\nwhiskers on his chin with his dragon\nclaw and muttered to himself\nthoughtfully, \"And what kind of cannon\nis this Italian cannon?\" When Fongu\nreturned to the manor, Olivia had\nalready seen Sonata Sauri off and\nreturned to the manor along with Li Chin\nLong. As soon as Fong Yu entered the\nmanor, he saw Li Chin Long being kicked\nto the ground by Olivia. \"What's going\non?\" Fong Yu asked, frowning. Upon\nhearing Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s voice, Li Chunlong\nimmediately scrambled to his feet and\nchuckled. He I was just idling around\nand thought I'd have a little sparring\nwith this miss Olivia. Oh, I see. Fongu\nraised an eyebrow and smiled. How was\nit? Were you thoroughly humiliated? Hey,\nenough said. Lie Chan Long shook his\nhead, pointing to the dented footprint\non his breastplate and said, \"You really\nhit me, didn't you?\" He Fong Yu patted\nLie Chun Long on the shoulder and said,\n\"You should be content. She's the same\neven when she fights me. By the way, why\ndid you come over here?\" Lie Chun Long\nlaughed and said, \"I just gathered 200\nelite troops in King&lt;unk&gt;s Landing and\nhappened to see Miss Olivia, so I came\nwith her to save us from having to find\na place to meet up later. I also thought\nI'd come and see you since I've never\nbeen here before.\" As he spoke, Lie\nChunlong pointed to the monster hunt\nnext to him, whose skeleton was made of\nthe remains of a giant spider with\ndemonic patterns and said, \"Boss, you\nkilled that thing, too.\" Funu shook his\nhead and said, \"I don't have that\nability. That thing is a war beast from\nthe demon realm. It is said to be even\nmore ferocious than an ordinary dragon.\nI just used its remains to build a\nhouse.\" What are those tentacles in the\nground? Also, I think I just saw a doll\nthat moved on its own. Hey, why are you\nacting like a curious child? Come on,\ncome on, come inside and have dinner\nwith me. We have important things to do\nafter dinner. So, Lie Chun Long followed\nFong Yu into the wooden house. As soon\nas he entered, he saw a beautiful female\nghost floating in midair and his breath\ncaught in his throat. Master, you're\nback. Valentina smiled charmingly at\nFong Yu, then said to Lee Chun Long\nbeside Fong Yu. Oh, do we have guests\ntonight? It seems we'll have to make a\nmore lavish dinner tonight. After saying\nthat, the female ghost turned and\nfloated into the kitchen. A female\nghost. Lie Chun Long stared wideeyed at\nthe kitchen, exclaiming in surprise,\n\"Boss, there's actually a female ghost\nin your house.\" \"What ghost nonsense?\"\nFong Yu gave Lie Chun Long a hard flick\non the forehead, scolding him. \"Don't\nyou know what respect is?\" \"Yes, yes, I\nwas wrong.\" Li Chunlong quickly\napologized, laughing. But to be honest,\nboss, this manner of yours is too\nstrange. There's a monster hut,\ntentacles, weird dolls, and stuff. And\nnow there's even a girl. A female ghost.\nAll right, a female ghost. Boss, what's\ngoing on here? Lie asked curiously. Fong\nYu walked to the table, pulled up a\nchair, and sat down, saying, \"If your\npersonal house is upgraded to a manor,\nyou can choose your own civilization\nstyle. For some reason, I chose the dark\nstyle. This manor is now called ghost\nmanor, but the facilities are not yet\ncomplete, so what you see is still\nrelatively small.\" Lie Chun Long nodded\nas if he understood, then pulled up a\nchair and sat down, continuing to ask.\nSo, the reason you're so powerful must\nbe because of the help this manner has\ngiven you, right? I guess so. Fong Yu\nthought for a moment and then asked,\n\"What are your plans for the operation\nin District 7 tonight?\" Lie Chun Long\nwas slightly taken aback and blurted\nout, \"What kind of plan could I possibly\nhave? Aren't I just following your\norders?\" Sigh. Fongu sighed and said,\n\"You have to think things through more\ndeeply. You are now the\ncommanderin-chief of the entire Sixth\nDistrict. You can't expect me to make\nall the decisions. The reason I brought\nyou along tonight is to see how good you\nare at troop deployment.\" \"I see,\" Lie\nChun Long exclaimed in sudden\nrealization. \"Let me think about it,\"\nFong Yu continued. \"Our territory will\ngrow larger and larger in the future. I\nmay not be able to take care of all\nsituations in many ways. I also have\nmany things to do. You will be\nresponsible for arranging things such as\nsending troops to conquer, guarding the\nterritory, and patrolling the inner\nrealm. Lieong nodded repeatedly. The\nreason I asked you to bring 200 elite\nsoldiers is so that you can select some\npeople with military talent from among\nthem and establish the organizational\nstructure of the troops as soon as\npossible. Otherwise, the current\ndisorganized and scattered model is not\nsustainable. Okay, no problem. I'll take\ncare of it right away. Just then,\nthe kitchen carrying dinner and said\nhappily, \"Master, dinner is ready. Let's\neat.\" Valentina was so happy because she\nlearned that Sonata Sari had been sent\nto King's Landing by Fong Yu, which\nmeant that her master was not actually\ninterested in that woman and would not\nbecome her rival. Seeing that dinner was\nready, Fong Yu stopped discussing\nbusiness and invited Olivia and Alpha to\nthe table to enjoy their meal. After\ndinner, Fong Yu left the manor with Lie\nChun Long, Olivia, and Alpha. They then\nwent to the spider forest to gather 200\nplayers and 500 Spartan zombies who were\nwaiting for them. Finally, they sped\ntowards Han Ko in District 7 to begin\nhis second decapitation operation.\nShortly after Fong Yu and his group\nleft, a mixed army of 300 men was\ngathering at the border between District\n5 and District 6. Leading the group was\na blonde man in a black cloak with blood\nred eyes and pale skin. His name was\nCharles Luther, the younger brother of\nSt. Paul Luther, the lord of District 4,\nand also a vampire. He was the only\nplayer to survive Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s night\nraid on the District 5 Allied Forces\ncamp. That very night, after Fong Yu led\nhis troops away, Charles followed the\nbloody scent of the zombie army all the\nway back to District 6, where he\ndiscovered Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s manor in the\nspider cave, where Fong Yu had placed\nhis zombie army. After a day of\ninvestigation, Charles finally\ndiscovered that the real boss of\nDistrict 6 was not the Lord Sanjiming,\nbut a guy named Fong Yu. After recalling\nthe ridiculously powerful zombie army\nthat Fong Yu led, Charles concluded that\nFong Yu must be the real boss of\nDistrict 6. So, he's planning something\nbig. He'll take advantage of Fong\nYu&lt;unk&gt;s unpreparedness and carry out a\ndecapitation strike. In Charles's view,\nFong Yu's real strength was his\ninvincible army of zombies. According to\nintelligence, Fong Yu himself was just\nan ordinary mage. The spider forest\nwhere Fong Yu stationed his zombie army\nwas quite a distance from his manner.\nHis sudden attack would not give Fong Yu\nany chance to go to the spider forest to\nmobilize his army. Therefore, he\nspecifically persuaded his lord brother\nto assign him 300 elite players to carry\nout a decapitation operation and prove\nhis strength to his brother who had\nalways looked down on him. After\nconfirming that the 300 players were\nready, Charles glanced at the time,\nwaved his hand and led the 300 players\nacross the border, heading straight for\nFong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s ghost manner to begin his\ndecapitation operation. He believed that\nas long as Fong Yu was killed, District\n6 would no longer be a threat. Chapter\n170. I am not only a magician, but also\na summoner. When Fong Yu led his troops\ninto the dense forest outside Han Ko,\nthey discovered that there were more\nthan a dozen arrow towers in Han Ko this\ntime. Moreover, the wooden spikes on the\nouter wooden wall had also been\nthickened. Eh, at least you've learned\nyour lesson and know to strengthen your\ndefenses now. Fong Yu sneered, then\nturned to Lie Chan Long beside him and\nasked, \"If I put everyone under your\ncommand, how do you plan to breach this\nvillage?\" After frowning and thinking\nfor a while, Lie Chun Long replied,\n\"I'll have you go and take out the\narchers on those nearby arrow towers\nfirst.\" H And then what? Then I'll have\nyou use the fire dragon spell to burn a\ngap in that wooden wall. After that,\nI'll ride the earth dragon and charge\nthrough the gap to carve a bloody path,\nand then the troops behind will charge\nin. Okay, then let's try your method.\nFongu nodded, dawned his invisibility\ncloak as usual, and headed alone towards\nHan Kio. This was his third raid on the\narchers on the arrow towers. Looking at\nthe bewildered archers on the towers,\nFong Yu couldn't help but sigh. It\nseemed that the archers on the arrow\ntowers probably had the highest\nmortality rate among the defending\ntroops. Call. Call. Call. Three wind\nblades were released in succession,\nwhistling as they flew towards the\narchers on the three arrow towers. Just\nwhen Fong Yu thought that the three\narchers would soon die under his windb\nblades, suddenly the swirling windb\nblades seemed to hit a transparent wall\nand instantly dissipated. Huh? What is\nthat? Fongu was quite surprised, but he\nsoon noticed that a faint light screen\nhad appeared in midair where the wind\nblades had disappeared. That seems to be\na defensive barrier. Fongu frowned. He\nhadn't expected that a defensive barrier\nwould appear in Hanqo after just one\nday. This was something he really hadn't\nanticipated. At the same time, the\narchers on the arrow tower were also\ndisturbed by the sound of the wind\nblades hitting the barrier. When they\nsaw the light screen appear, they\nrealized that it was an enemy attack.\nSo, they immediately shouted to the\nvillage. Seeing this, Fongu stepped back\nto Li Chinlong&lt;unk&gt;s side and asked,\n\"Now that we've been discovered, what do\nyou think we should do?\" Li Chin Long\nscratched his head and hesitated.\n\"Should we retreat first? Retreat my\nfoot, Fong Yu snapped irritably. Is this\nyour way of commanding? Retreat the\nmoment you're discovered. Lie and Long\nexplained. But I only brought 200 men.\nEven with your 500 man force, that's\nonly 700 men, fewer than theirs. Plus,\nwe're the attacking side and the village\nhas protective shields, making it very\ndifficult to take it. Upon hearing this,\nFongu turned to Olivia and asked, \"Would\nit be difficult to take down this\nvillage with 500 zombie troops?\" Olivia\nshook her head without hesitation and\nsaid, \"There shouldn't be any problem.\nDid you hear that?\" Fongu glanced at Lie\nChun Long and said, \"All right, now the\ncommand is handed over to Olivia. You\nwatch carefully. Learn well.\" After\nsaying that, Fongu said to Olivia, who\nwas standing next to him, \"You can do\nit.\" Olivia nodded and under her\ncontrol, the 500 zombies behind her\nbegan to move. They silently walked out\nof the dense forest and began to form a\nsquare formation in the clearing outside\nthe forest. The shield wielding\npigheaded men stood in the first row,\nthe crypt dwarves in the middle, and the\nrest of the human walkers at the back.\nAfter the formation was completed,\nOlivia said to Fong Yu, \"Master, please\nuse the earth collapse spell on the wall\ndirectly in front of you.\" \"Earth\ncollapse spell? Why use this spell?\"\nFongu asked curiously. \"You saw the\nlight barrier that blocked your wind\nblade just now. It's a protective\nformation that can block external\nattacks. Although we can use the zombie\narmy's attacks to deplete the protective\nformation's energy until it disappears,\nthat would be too time-consuming.\"\nOlivia pointed to the village's walls\nand explained, \"But this kind of\nprotective formation can usually only\nprotect the space above ground. If you\nuse the earth concealment technique on\nthe ground below the walls, you can not\nonly destroy the walls, but the sunken\nground can also provide us with a\npassage straight to the inside of the\nprotective shield.\" After listening,\nFong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s eyes were full of\napproval. He turned to Lie Chun Long\nbeside him and said, \"See that? That's\nwhat you call professional. Liechin\nlong. Immediately, Fong Yu put on the\ninvisibility cloak again and began\nchanting the intermediate earth magic,\nearth collapse, as he approached the\nvillage because he rarely used this\nspell and it was an intermediate spell.\nEven with the help of his wand and magic\ngloves, he still couldn't cast it\ninstantly. The earth collapse spell\nconsumes 80 mana points per use. It can\nrapidly compress the loose soil in a\ncircular area with a diameter of 10 m,\ncausing it to collapse and create a pit\n3 m deep. It is generally used for\nterrain modification and trap\nconstruction on the battlefield. It can\nalso be used directly on enemy troops,\ncausing them to fall into the pit and be\ncaptured. In addition, this skill is\nalso very effective for siege warfare\nbecause no city wall can stand without\nits foundation. However, some large\ncities take this issue into account when\nbuilding their walls. Therefore, when\nconstructing the walls, they first build\na stone foundation with a depth of more\nthan 5 m and set up a magic blocking\narray to prevent the walls from\ncollapsing due to such magic attacks. Of\ncourse, it is obvious that the wooden\nwalls of this simple village could not\npossibly have a stone foundation. As\nFong Yu finished his spell incantation\nin about 20 seconds, the earth element\ncrystal on his wand emitted a pale\nyellow light. With a gentle wave of Fong\nYu&lt;unk&gt;s hand, the light quickly\ndisappeared into the ground beneath the\nwall. A moment later, a dull thud was\nheard, and as dust rose, the wooden wall\nof the village collapsed and fell into\nthe pit. Meanwhile, the zombie troops\nbehind Fong Yu, under Olivia's command,\nhad already rushed into the collapsed\npit. Just as Olivia had predicted, the\nprotective barrier covered the ground\nlike a lid, and the deep pit beneath it\nbecame a huge gap in the village. At the\nsame time, Fongu also considered the\nissue of passage through the deep pit.\nSo, he used the low-level earth magic,\nsoil shaping, to create two ramps in the\npit to facilitate the movement of the\nzombies up and down. Once the zombies\nswarmed into the village through the\ngap, Fongu knew the situation was under\ncontrol. Fongu had already instructed\nSonata Sari to issue a statement on the\nseventh district's public channel during\nthe day, stating that if the people in\nHong Ko were unwilling to transfer\ndistricts or accepts Sonatasari's\nleadership by nightfall, they would not\nbe treated with courtesy. Therefore,\nonce the zombies entered the village,\nthey acted without restraint and began a\nmassacre under Olivia's orders. On the\nbattlefield, there is no mercy for a\nstubborn enemy. As the zombie army,\nvirtually immune to physical attacks,\nstormed in, the defensive forces of Han\nKo crumbled almost instantly with the\nnearest arrow towers quickly being\npushed down by the dwarf zombies. Lie,\nwho had been watching from the\nsidelines, finally couldn't hold back\nany longer and wanted to lead his 200\nwarriors into the village for a fierce\nbattle. After all, the idea of tearing\napart Japanese people is very attractive\nto most Chinese men. But at this moment,\nOlivia frowned and stopped Li Chun Long,\nsaying, \"You and your Earth Dragon can\ngo in, but they can't.\" \"Why?\" Liun Long\nasked, puzzled. \"I sense that several\nzombie warriors are already dead,\"\nOlivia replied. \"How many?\" Liin\nLong&lt;unk&gt;s eyes widened. \"How can a\nsiege not result in casualties? It's\nnormal for a few people to die.\" Olivia\nglanced at Li Chun Long and said, \"It\ntakes more than just ordinary combat\npower to kill walkers. If you want your\ncompanions to die, then let them go.\"\nThis at this moment, Fongu returned to\nOlivia's side and asked, \"What's going\non?\" So Olivia explained the situation\nto Fong Yu. Fong Yu frowned and said,\n\"If I'm not mistaken, that high-end\ncombatant should be Lu and Ya.\" Then\nFong Yu turned to Li Chun Long and said,\n\"Okay, Olivia and I will go in and you\ntake these 200 people to provide support\noutside.\" Li Chan Long naturally obeyed\nFong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s orders. So Fong Yu and\nOlivia followed the pit into the village\nand rushed towards the direction where\nthe zombies had died. Soon, Fong Yu saw\na young man in a magic robe controlling\na fire dragon flying towards a human\nzombie. The huge fire dragon quickly\nengulfed the human zombie's body and\nthen the fire dragon rushed towards\nanother zombie. Fongu narrowed his eyes.\nJudging from the appearance, that guy\nwas also a mage and a mid-level mage at\nthat. If nothing unexpected happened,\nthis guy should be Lie Yu and Ya.\nWithout wasting words, Fong Yu released\na windb blade that shot towards Li Yu Ya\nwhile Olivia charged towards him with\nher ax. At this moment, Lua also noticed\nOlivia rushing towards him. Seeing the\nfull set of wild boar armor that Olivia\nwas wearing, he realized that Olivia was\nnot one of those ordinary zombie\nwarriors. He immediately changed the\ndirection of the fire dragons attack and\nattacked Olivia. At that moment, Fong\nYu&lt;unk&gt;s wind blades also flew in front\nof him, aiming directly at Li Yu\nYa&lt;unk&gt;s neck. However, to Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s\nsurprise, his wind blade was blocked by\nan invisible light barrier once again\nwhen it was about to reach Lie Yu Ya. a\nshield. Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s eyes widened. This\nguy's got something special. After the\nwindb blade attack was blocked by the\nshield on Li Yu Ya&lt;unk&gt;s body, it\nnaturally aroused his vigilance. After\nusing the fire dragon to force Olivia\nback, Li Yu Ya turned to look at Fong\nYu. When he saw the gorgeous magic wand\nin Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s hand, he realized that\nFong Yu was a magician. After a moment's\nthought, Lie Yu and Yao shouted at Fong\nYu, \"Do you dare to have a fair duel\nwith me?\" on the honor of a magician.\nUpon hearing this, Fong Yu immediately\nlaughed and said with a smile, \"Okay.\"\nLiu and Yao breathed a sigh of relief.\nUpon hearing this, the group that\nattacked Hono should be Fong Yu, the\nstrongest in District 6, and his troops.\nAccording to the intelligence he had\ngathered, Fong Yu was also a mid-level\nmage, on par with his own level. He also\nhad a legendary level equipment with\nextremely strong defense. As long as his\nmagic power was sufficient, he could\nwithstand external attacks indefinitely.\nTherefore, if I can kill Fong Yu in this\none-on-one duel, I will most likely be\nable to repel the attack from District\n6. And if I can obtain the staff that\nFong Yu is holding, which is obviously\nof a high level, my strength will\ndefinitely be able to reach a higher\nlevel. Lie Yu and Yao then got into\nposition and said to Fong Yu. Then let's\nbegin. Fong Yu looked at Lie Yu and Ya\nwho was on high alert and smiled\nslightly saying, \"Okay, but I forgot to\ntell you. I am not only a magician, but\nalso a summoner.\" After saying that,\nFongu gave Olivia a wink. And then\nhundreds of dwarf zombies around him\nsurrounded Lie Yu Ya, carrying clubs in\ntheir hands. Chapter 171. The Abyss's\nresentful mother. Lie Yu and Yao\npanicked when she saw a group of 3 m\ntall green-skinned demons surrounding\nher. You You're despicable. You have no\nsportsmanship. You have no sense of\ncontract. Lie Yu and Ya glared at Fong\nYu, who was not far away and cursed. You\nhave absolutely no sense of honor. He\nFong Yu shrugged and looked at the young\nman with a playful gaze. He said, \"Young\nman, I doubt your Japanese teachers\ntaught you the phrase all's fair in war,\nright?\" And you're too naive to expect a\nfair fight on the battlefield. Why not?\nThis is the spirit of Bushidto. Luan\nexclaimed. So according to you, even if\nI have an atomic bomb, if I encounter\nsomeone like you carrying a type 38\nrifle, do I have to drop the atomic bomb\nand just shoot at each other with type\n38 rifles? Funu scoffed. That's\nincredibly naive. After saying that,\nFong Yu gave Olivia another look. And a\ngroup of dwarf demons, each over 3 m\ntall, surrounded the young magician, who\nwas almost 5 ft tall, and began to smash\nhim with their clubs. As the hammer\nblows resounded, the Hono guards who had\nbeen resisting saw that their leader was\ngone again and finally lost all hope.\nThey dropped their weapons and knelt on\nthe ground, begging for mercy. Of\ncourse, a small number of fanatical\nnationalists launched suicidal attacks\non the walkers, but they were quickly\nslaughtered by the walkers. Olivia\nwalked up to Fong Yu and asked, \"What\nshould we do with these people, Master?\nShould we kill them directly, or Fongu\nnaturally had no intention of showing\nmercy to these guys who had been given a\nchance but didn't appreciate it? These\npeople were basically opportunists with\nmalicious intentions, and keeping them\naround would only cause trouble. It was\nbetter to kill them all and turn them\ninto zombies. Just as Fong Yu was about\nto instruct Olivia to take action, a\nlow, sharp, and indistinguishable male\nand female sobbing sound suddenly rang\nin Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s ears.\nFongu frowned and asked Olivia, \"Did you\nhear something?\" At this moment, Olivia\nlooked up at the sky and then said with\na very ugly expression, \"Master,\nlet's&lt;unk&gt; go.\" Following Olivia's gaze,\nFong Yu saw a huge grayish white object\nthat looked like a mushroom or a cotton\ncandy appear in the sky above the\nvillage. Don't look at it. Olivia\npressed Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s head down and said\nurgently, \"Quickly, notify those people\noutside the village to evacuate\nimmediately.\" Fong Yu trusted Olivia's\njudgment. Immediately lowered his head,\nopened the chat channel, and asked Li\nChin Long to notify the 200 people\nguarding outside the village to\nevacuate. After giving the notification,\nFong Yu saw that Olivia had already\ndirected all the walkers to leave the\nvillage quickly and urged Fong Yu to\nevacuate again. At this moment, Fong Yu\nnoticed that Lie Yu and Yao, who was\nsurrounded by the group of dwarf demons,\nwas still alive. The light shield on\nthat guy had actually blocked the fierce\nhammer blows of more than a dozen dwarf\ndemons. It seems that Li Yu and Yao must\npossess some extremely powerful\ndefensive treasure. We need to find a\nway to get it. So Fong Yu said, \"Or\nshould we take out that guy first?\"\nOlivia said urgently. \"Master, don't\nworry about that guy. He&lt;unk&gt;ll\ndefinitely die if he stays here, and\nwe'll die if we don't leave.\" Fong Yu\nwas slightly startled upon hearing this\njust because of that thing in the sky.\nFong Yu had no suspicions and could only\nturn around and follow Olivia as they\nran out of the village. What is that?\nFongu asked in surprise as he ran. You\nshould know that Olivia was unfazed even\nwhen she saw the dragon Odum. But after\nseeing that cotton candy-like thing, her\nexpression remained tense. That's the\nabyssal mother of the demon realm,\nOlivia replied. That thing is even more\ntroublesome than a dragon. In our\ncurrent state, we are no match for it. A\nmother's resentment from the abyss. Fong\nYu then summoned the game assistant and\ninquired about information regarding the\nabyss. Vengeful mother. Abyssal vengeful\nmother. A powerful abyssal evil spirit\nformed from the convergence of thousands\nof vengeful spirits who have fallen into\nthe abyss. It feeds on freshly deceased\nindividuals. It ignores physical damage\nand most magical damage and possesses\nmany extremely powerful skills. Skill\none, soul shriek, causes a shock wave of\nsoul energy to creatures within a 100 m\nradius. Being hit by the soul shriek\nreduces mental value by 20 and inflicts\na state of sensory confusion for 1\nminute. Skill two, passive mirror of\nevil spirits. Anyone who looks directly\nat the abyss mother of vengeance within\nher perception range will have their\nsoul marked by an evil spirit within\nher. The evil spirit will then transform\ninto an exact replica of the marked\nperson to assassinate and devour their\nsoul. If the marked person's soul is\ndevoured by the evil spirit, the evil\nspirit will directly occupy that\nperson's body and memories, becoming a\nservant of the abyss mother of\nvengeance. Skill three, gift of hatred.\nAny creature that dares to attack the\nabyssal mother will have its soul marked\nby her. Even if it escapes to the ends\nof the earth, the abyssal mother will\nrelentlessly pursue it until death.\nThose marked by the gift of hatred have\ntheir luck reduced by five points, and\nthere is a 50% chance of having a\nnightmare when they fall asleep. Waking\nup from a nightmare will deduct 30\npoints of spirit. The mark will not be\nremoved even if the abyssal mother dies\nunless one has extremely powerful soul\nprotecting equipment or a highle holy\nmage performs soul purification. After\nreading the introduction from the game\nassistant, Fongu was completely\nastonished. It's one thing to ignore\nphysical damage and most magical damage,\nbut those three skills are just insanely\npowerful. The first skill, Soulcream,\ncan confuse a person's five senses for 1\nminute. When combined with the second\nskill, evil spirit realm, it directly\nreplicates an evil spirit to attack and\nkill the original soul. This is true\ndamage that ignores defense, and it is\nsimply unsolvable, especially the third\nskill. As long as you actively attack\nthe abyss mother, you will be marked\nwith a debuff that will never die. It's\nso disgusting that it's like the mother\nof all disgust. Disgusting to the\nextreme. No wonder even an undead\nwarrior as strong as Olivia, who\nwouldn't flinch at the sight of a\ndragon, would run away as soon as she\nsaw one. How could she possibly not run?\nFighting a dragon, even if you lose, is\njust a matter of one dragon flame. You\ndie without any pain. But if you fight\nthis thing and lose, your soul will be\ndevoured and your body will become a\nghost servant. Even if you kill it,\nyou'll still be left with a debuff. Is\nthis even playable? Fong Yu and his\ngroup only stopped when they rushed out\nof the village and ran to the edge of\nthe dense forest a 100 meters away. Fong\nYu turned his head to look in the\ndirection of Han Kio and saw that the\nabyss demon mother, which was nearly 100\nm long and looked like a gray cotton\ncandy, was slowly descending into Hano.\nMoreover, countless vengeful spirits\nvisible to the naked eye were breaking\nfree from the mother body and flying\ntowards the ground. Before long,\nearpiercing screams and maniacal\nlaughter began to echo through the\nvillage along with the sounds of metal\nclashing. If I'm not mistaken, it should\nbe people whose bodies have been\npossessed by evil spirits and turned\ninto ghost servants who are fighting\nwith the survivors. This village is\nbeyond saving, Olivia asserted. Let's\nevacuate as soon as possible. Lie Chan\nLong, who was standing to the side\nlooking confused, asked with a blank\nexpression, what's going on? How come\nthey all came out again while we were\nfighting? Fong Yu pointed to the abyssal\ndemon mother floating above Han Kio and\nsaid helplessly. Do you know what that\nthing is? Lie Chun Long shook his head.\nHuh? It looks like a cotton candy. The\nabyss's resentful mother. Fongu said,\n\"You can find out for yourself.\" So Lie\nChun Long also summoned his game\nassistant to look up information about\nthe abyss vengeful mother. A moment\nlater. Holy crap. Lie Chun Long\nexclaimed in surprise. This thing is\ninsane. Fong Yu sighed and said, \"Now\nyou know why we came out, right?\" Li\nChun Long nodded, but then asked\npuzzled. \"But why would such a bizarre\nthing appear in this place?\" Fong Yu\nthought for a moment and replied,\n\"District 7 ranked sixth in the last\nregional ranking. Doesn't the system\nassign a calamity level ferocious beast\nto the bottom five regions?\" I guess\nit's this thing. Li Chunlong suddenly\nrealized. I see. I knew it. So, what do\nwe do now? What else can we do but\nretreat? Boss, I just said we should\nretreat and you yelled at me. How can\nthat be the same? Fongu said irritably.\nJust now we could crush those people in\nHong Ko, but now that abyss vengeful\nmother can crush all of us. Times have\nchanged. Do you understand? We have no\nchance of winning now. Are we just going\nto wait here to die instead of\nretreating? Liin Long scratched his head\nand chuckled awkwardly. It's not\nentirely impossible to win. Look, he\nsaid, pointing to Han Kio. Aren't there\nstill people fighting in there? They've\neven launched a counterattack against\nthat abyss vengeful mother. Fongu was\nslightly taken aback when he heard this\nand then turned his head to look. Sure\nenough, he saw a dazzling fire dragon\ntear through the night sky and strike\nthe huge body of the abyss mother. It\neven scorched a huge gash on the\ncloud-like body of the mother. Fong Yu\nwas slightly taken aback upon seeing\nthis. Huh? Could it be that Li Yuan Ya\nis still alive? Is that guy some kind of\ncockroach? But then Fong Yu saw a second\nfire dragon rise into the sky and attack\nthe abyss vengeful mother in the air. It\nseems that Lie Yuan Ya is fighting\ndesperately against the abyss's vengeful\nmother. Seeing this, Fun Yu couldn't\nhelp but wonder, \"How did Lie Yu Ya\nmanaged to survive until now? Was it\nbecause of that shield that could\nwithstand damage? That shield could not\nonly withstand physical damage, but also\ndamage from the soul. If that's the\ncase, then that treasure is probably not\njust a legendary treasure, but even a\ndivine artifact. But as soon as he\nthought of the divine artifact, Fongu\ndown at the ring on his hand. He now has\nthree rings. One is Windrunner's Guard.\nOne is the archage storage ring and the\nother is the undead elegy that Fong Yu\nobtained from the undead basement when\nhe upgraded to the manor. The key point\nis this elegy of the dead because its\ngrade is artifact level. More\nimportantly, after wearing this ring,\none can become immune to soul-based\ncontrol and resist soul-based damage\nbelow the level of a god. The three\nskills of this abyss vengeful mother in\nfront of us all seem to be related to\nthe soul. So, now that I'm protected by\nthis elegy of the dead, shouldn't I try\nto take down that thing? Fu felt a\nslight urge to act. Chapter 172. The\nwonderful uses of the divine artifact\nreququum of the dead. Regarding whether\nor not to kill the abyss vengeful\nmother, the answer is yes, because\nDistrict 7 is actually Fong Yu's\nterritory. If this monster is not killed\nand left to continue to wreak havoc in\nDistrict 7, it will also be a loss for\nFong Yu. However, figuring out how to\ndefeat this abyss vengeful mother is a\nreal headache. Although he possessed the\nartifact Elegy of the Dead, his defense\nshould not be a problem. But how to kill\nthe Abyss Wraith mother was a question.\nJudging from the attack methods of the\nsource of ya, the fire dragon technique\ncan indeed damage the abyss vengeful\nmother's main body, but the damage is\nvery limited. A fire dragon can only\nburn a hole about 1 m in diameter in the\nbody of the vengeful mother before it is\nextinguished by the evil spirits gushing\nout from her body. Compared to the\nnearly 100 m long size of the vengeful\nmother, this damage seemed\ninsignificant. In fact, Fong Yu even\nnoticed that the holes burned by the\nfire dragon on the vengeful mother's\nbody showed signs of self-healing. Even\nwith the 200 magic points from the Azure\nSea Pearl, I only have a little over 560\nmagic points now. Enough for a few Fire\nDragon spells. Therefore, we need to\nthink of other solutions. Sigh. If\nValentina were here, that would be\ngreat. She's a magician, and she knows a\nlot about the undead and souls. Fongu\nregretted not bringing her along this\ntime. Thinking of Valentina, Fongu then\nthought of something else. Valentina\nforged a soul blade for herself.\nThinking of this, Fongu summoned the 20\ncm long silver dagger from his palm.\nHaving been nurtured within his body for\nmany days, the soul blade was now\nemitting a faint purple glow, looking\nextremely cool. This thing should be\nable to harm the abyss mother and those\nvengeful spirits flying in the air. But\nthis thing is a melee weapon and a\ndagger at extremely close range. How can\nyou use this dagger to attack the abyss\nmother? Could it be that he uses the\ndance of the wind to drag his body into\nthe sky, then grabs this dagger and\ncharges into the body of the abyss\nmother of vengeance to wreak havoc? Hm,\nthat seems like a good idea. At this\nmoment, the game assistant Xiao Lu sent\na notification. Use your brain. Think\nagain. Why don't you use your mental\npower to control this soul blade to\nattack like a flying sword? Holy crap.\nFongu was stunned. He really hadn't\nthought of this method. As a novelist,\nhow can your imagination be so barren? I\ndespise you. So Fongu began to try to\nuse his mental power to guide the flying\nsword in his hand, or rather the soul\nblade, to levitate. Upon seeing this,\nLie Chunlong&lt;unk&gt;s eyes widened in\nsurprise, and he exclaimed, \"Holy crap,\nboss. I never knew you could cultivate\nimmortality. You even know sword\ncontrol. Control my sword, my ass.\"\nFongu said irritably. I'm using mental\npower and magic power. At this moment,\nXiaolu sent another message. Actually,\nthe sword control technique is similar\nto the method you're using now. Both use\nmental power or intention to manipulate\nflying swords. The only difference is\nthat one uses magic power as energy\nwhile the other uses true essence. Upon\nseeing this information, Fong Yu was\noverjoyed, thinking to himself, \"So,\nI've actually accidentally mastered the\ncultivation method of a sword immortal.\"\nIf there's anything that's more\nappealing to Fong Yu than being a\nmagician, it's undoubtedly becoming a\nsword immortal. One sword illuminates\nthe nine provinces. Two swords cleave\nthe heavens. Just imagining that scene\nis enough to get your blood pumping.\nYuri overthinking it. True essence can\nmodify a cultivator's physical\nstructure. But demonic power doesn't\nhave that ability. If you really want to\ncultivate immortality, wait until you're\nstronger and go to the Eastern\nContinent. Then we'll see if you have\nthe right opportunity. Dot. The Eastern\ncontinent was still a bit far away for\nFong Yu at the moment. He hadn't even\nfigured out the continent he was on yet.\nSo thinking about it was pointless. So\nhe began to concentrate and tried to use\nhis mental power to control the soul\nblade to fly into the distance. He needs\nto know the maximum distance he can\ncontrol the soul blade in order to\ndetermine his attack range. Finally,\nwhen Fongu sent the soul blade to a\nposition of about 30 m, he began to feel\nthat he was having some difficulty\ncontrolling the trajectory of the soul\nblade. In other words, the attack range\nof his soul blade was within 30 m, much\nshorter than the 100 m Fongu had\nexpected because the maximum attack\nrange of his fireball and windb blade\nspells was 100 m and the maximum attack\nrange of fire dragon spells was around\n80 m. However, considering that this was\nmy first time using this method to\nmanipulate objects, it should also be\nrelated to my proficiency. If I practice\nmore in the future, I should be able to\nimprove the attack range. However, for\nthe moment, a distance of 30 m is\nactually enough because the mother of\nthe abyss in midair has now descended to\nless than 20 m above the ground and is\nemitting a series of eerie shrieks. Even\nat a distance of about 200 m, the sound\npierced the eardrums of Fong Yu and his\ncompanions, not to mention the survivors\nin the village. At this moment, the fire\ndragon summoned by Li Yu Ya had also\ndisappeared. It was unknown whether he\nhad died or whether the spell-casting\nhad been interrupted by the piercing\nshriek. Fongu knew it was time for him\nto make his move. The best opportunity\nwas to launch a surprise attack while\nthe abyss wraith mother's attention was\nstill on the survivors in the village.\nSo, after greeting Olivia, Fongu rushed\ntoward the village. As soon as Fong Yu\nentered the village, he was met with two\nevil spirits that fell from the sky.\nThese two evil spirits were all bluish\ngray and had ferocious faces. Their\ntarget was two fleeing survivors.\nJudging from their appearance, these two\nevil spirits were exactly the same as\nthe two survivors. They should be two\nevil spirits summoned by the passive\nskill of the abyss vengeful mother\nmirror of evil spirits which wanted to\ndevour the soul of the original body. To\ntest the damage of the soul blade, Fongu\ndirectly manipulated it to stab one of\nthe evil spirits. A streak of silver\nlight flashed and the soul blade pierced\nthe evil spirits chest in an instant.\nThe evil spirit then let out a shrill\nscream and clutched the hole in its\nchest where the soul blade had pierced.\nImmediately afterwards, a dark red light\nlike that of burning paper scraps shone\nfrom the hole, and the evil spirit's\nsoul began to burn. Soon, the dark red\nlight spread to the evil spirits entire\nbody, and the evil spirit quickly turned\ninto a dark red ash amidst a series of\nshrill screams scattering on the ground.\nUpon seeing this, Fongu was overjoyed.\nHe hadn't expected the soul blade to be\nso effective against evil spirits. At\nthat moment, another evil spirit, after\nwitnessing the death of its companion,\nabandoned its prey and pounced on Fong\nYu with a ferocious expression. Because\nof his momentary joy, Fong Yu reacted a\nstep too slowly and didn't have time to\nretract the flying soulblade. Just as\nthe evil spirit was about to pounce on\nFong Yu, the artifact ring, Elegy of the\nDead on Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s fingertip emitted\na faint purple light. Instantly, a chain\nformed from dark purple light shot out\nfrom the ring and wrapped itself around\nthe evil spirit that was approaching.\nThe evil spirit, bound by the purple\nchains, froze in place, its previously\nferocious expression calming down as if\nit had gone mad. Your artifact, Reququum\nof the Undead, has captured a low-level\nwraith. You may enslave it. Do you wish\nto enslave it? Seeing the notification\npop up from the game assistant, Fun Yu's\ntense expression calmed down, and he\nrevealed a faint smile. He had almost\nforgotten that his artifact also had the\nability to enslave the undead. It was\ntruly incredibly useful, so he chose yes\nwithout hesitation. Chapter 173.\nEnslaving vengeful spirits. upgrading\nthe divine artifact. After Fong Yu chose\nto enslave, the purple light chain\nglowed slightly, and a pale purple aura\ninstantly entered the evil spirits body\nthrough the light chain. A moment later,\nthe evil spirits empty eyes regained\ntheir light, and it bowed to Fong Yu and\ncalled out, \"Master.\" Seeing that the\nevil spirit had been enslaved, Fongu\nmanipulated the light chains back into\nthe ring and said to the evil spirit,\n\"Protect me.\" Immediately, Fong Yu ran\ntowards the tallest wooden house in the\ncenter of the village. After leaping\nonto the roof using the dance of wind,\nhe began to control the soul blade and\nstab it at the abyss vengeful mother in\nmidair. At this time, the abyss mother\nhad descended to a height of only a\ndozen meters from the roof. The large\nholes that Lie Yu Ya had blasted in her\nbelly with his fire dragon had mostly\nhealed, but evil spirits would still\noccasionally emerge from the mother's\nbelly and fly towards various corners of\nthe village. After observing for a\nwhile, Fongu couldn't find any weakness\nin this abyss mother, which was as big\nas a cotton candy. So, he gritted his\nteeth and directly manipulated the sole\nblade to stab the abyss mother in the\nabdomen. A distance of a dozen meters is\nbut a moment for a flying blade. The\nsoul blade pierced the grayish white\nparitonyium of the abyss mother and Fong\nYu then manipulated the soul blade to\npull it back. Tear. A sound like leather\nbeing sliced open by a knife rang out.\nAnd the abyss wraith mother's abdomen\nwas slashed open by the soul blade,\nleaving a gash nearly 10 m long. Eek! A\nsharp infantile shriek rang out and the\nabyss mother's sky covering body began\nto tremble. Immediately, a black\nseedlike object flew out of the abyss\nmother's body and shot towards Fong Yu.\nIt was the Abyss Mother's third skill,\ngift of hatred. Any being that dares to\nattack the Abyss Mother will be given\nthis seed of hatred by the Abyss Mother.\nThe Abyss Mother will mark the attacker\nand hunt them down while also bringing\nmisfortune to the marked one. However,\nas the black seed flew close to Fong Yu,\nit was blocked by the purple light\nshield released by the Elegy of the\nDead. It bounced off the roof and turned\ninto a pool of black pus. Then, a black\nvengeful spirit flew out of the pus,\nseemingly trying to escape back into the\nbody of the abyss mother. But Fongu did\nnot give it a chance to escape. He\ndirectly used the purple chains of the\nelegy of the dead to bind it and enslave\nit. Seeing that the gift of hatred which\nhad worried him the most had no effect\non him, Fong Yu finally felt relieved.\nSo he looked up again at the true form\nof the vengeful mother. At this moment,\nhe noticed that the gash in the abdomen\nof the abyss wraith mother, which had\nbeen cut open by the soul blade, did not\nheal slowly like it had been blasted by\nthe fire dragon technique. In fact, a\ndark red glow, like sparks, appeared\naround the edge of the wound, just like\nthe evil spirit that Fong Yu had stabbed\nto death earlier. The wound began to\nexpand continuously. \"H, this seems to\nbe quite effective,\" Fongu exclaimed in\nsurprise. \"Could it be that just by\nmaking this one cut, this abyss wraith\nmother can burn herself to death?\" But\nas it turns out, he was overthinking it.\nSoon, several evil spirits flew out from\nthe wound on the abyss mother's abdomen.\nThese evil spirits quickly pounced on\nthe wound and transferred the dark red\nenergy at the edge of the wound to\nthemselves. After a series of chilling\nhowls, the evil spirits turned to ashes.\nBut the dark red energy at the wound on\nthe abyss mother's abdomen also\ndisappeared. And soon, the wound began\nto heal rapidly at a speed visible to\nthe naked eye. Damn it. This is insane.\nFong you cursed, then once again\nmanipulated the soul blade to stab at\nthe abyss mother's abdomen. Let's see\nhow many evil spirits you can use to\nrepair your body. Cut, cut, cut, slice,\nslice, slice. With Fong Yu's frantic\noutput, the Abyss Wraith mother's\nabdomen was soon slashed open with six\nnarrow gashes by the soul blade. This\ntime, the abyss mother seemed to realize\nthat she was under fierce attack and let\nout a shrill scream that was extremely\nmiserable and penetrating. A\nsoul-piercing scream. In the blink of an\neye, an invisible shock wave of soul\nenergy crashed toward the ground. Just\nbefore the shock wave struck Fong Yu,\nthe soul elegy between his fingers\nreleased a pale purple light once more,\nforming a pale purple light shield that\nenveloped Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s entire body,\ncompletely blocking the soul shock wave.\nAlthough the aggressive soul energy was\nblocked by the purple light shield, the\nsharp sound waves still penetrated the\npurple barrier. It was as if two huge\nspeakers were playing a female ghost\nscream right next to his ears. Fong Yu\nimmediately felt as if his ears were\nabout to explode. The intense dizziness\ncaused by the sound waves instantly made\nhis mind go blank, and the soul blade\nfell diagonally from midair. Just as\nFong Yu was in a daysaze, countless\nvengeful spirits poured out from the\ndamaged abdomen of the abyss Mother of\nVengeance. Some began to repair its\ndamaged body, while others rushed\ntowards the ground. These vengeful\nspirits quickly discovered Fong Yu\nstanding on the roof and screamed as\nthey rushed towards him. Fong Yu only\nwoke up when the vengeful spirits\npounced on him and the Reququum of the\nDead released nine purple chains to bind\nthe nine spirits. The game assistant\nthen sent him a message. Your artifact,\nReququum of the Undead, has captured\nnine low-level wraiths. You may enslave\nthem now. Do you wish to enslave them?\nFong Yu suppressed the discomfort in his\nmind and chose yes with his will. After\nthe nine vengeful spirits transformed\ninto his servants, these vengeful\nspirits began to entangle and fight with\nthe later vengeful spirits. At this\nmoment, Fongu saw a new message from the\ngame assistant. Your artifact, the\nReququum of the Undead, has successfully\ncaptured 10 vengeful spirits. You can\nabsorb the soul power of these spirits\nto upgrade it. upgrade now, huh? It can\neven be upgraded. Fong Yu was slightly\ntaken aback, but then he realized that\nthis ring was a divine artifact, so it\nwas reasonable for it to be able to be\nupgraded. He just didn't know what the\neffect would be after the upgrade. At\nthis moment, Fongu had lost the soul\nblade. The 10 vengeful spirits he had\nenslaved were already fighting with\ndozens of other vengeful spirits. The\nremaining vengeful spirits pounced on\nFong use purple protective shield,\ntearing at it. The dense swarm of\nvengeful spirits had surrounded Fong Yu\nfrom all sides. Forget about finding the\nsoul blade. He couldn't even tell which\nway was which. Now, therefore, the only\nthing they can rely on right now is the\nartifact, Elegy of the Dead. Funu\ngritted his teeth and decided to see if\nthe artifact would have any new\nfunctions after it was upgraded. So, he\nchose to upgrade. The next second, the\n10 enslaved vengeful spirits that were\nabout to be torn apart by the vengeful\nspirits were instantly bound by 10\npurple chains and dragged into the ring.\nYour artifact, undead elegy, has been\nupgraded to one star. Current number of\nundead you can enslave, 20. Huh, that's\nit. No new skills have been introduced.\nFongu felt somewhat disappointed, but\nseeing that the number of undead he\ncould enslave had increased from 10 to\n20 was still a decent improvement. Soon,\nthe upgraded Elegy of the Dead\nautomatically launched 20 purple chains,\nlocking the 20 vengeful spirits around\nFong Yu. Your artifact, Reququum of the\nUndead, has captured 20 low-level\nwraiths. You may enslave them now. Do\nyou wish to enslave them? Yes. Your\nartifact, the Reququum of the Undead,\nhas successfully captured 10 vengeful\nspirits. You can absorb the soul power\nof these spirits to upgrade it. Upgrade\nnow. Yes, your artifact, Undead Elegy,\nhas been upgraded to two stars.\nCurrently, you can enslave 40 undead.\nThis chapter 174, killing the vengeful\nmother, searching for Lua. In just a few\nbreaths, the chains extended by the\nelegy of the soul cleared away all the\nvengeful spirits that had gathered\naround him. Fongu glanced down at the\nsoul elegy on his finger, its purple\nlight gradually intensifying, and a\nstrange smile slowly crept onto his\nlips. He suddenly realized that even\nwithout new skills, simply enslaving and\nabsorbing vengeful spirits to upgrade\nthe ring seemed to be a very powerful\nmethod. Fong Yu then raised his head and\nshouted at the abyss vengeful mother\nabove him. You little bastard. Is that\nall you've got? Dare to send down more\nvengeful spirits. As soon as Fong Yu\nsaid this, a hideous ghost face suddenly\nappeared on the grayish white\nparitonyium of the abyss vengeful\nmother's abdomen and roared at Fong Yu.\nThis time, Fongu was more experienced.\nHe immediately covered his ears with\nboth hands, and soon a soul shriek that\nwas much more intense than before rushed\ntowards Fong Yu. In an instant, the\npowerful shock wave crushed the wooden\nhouse beneath Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s feet. After\na cloud of dust, Fong Yu crawled out of\nthe wreckage. \"Huh?\" Fongu spat out the\ndust in his mouth, then looked up and\nmocked the abyss mother in midair again.\n\"Is that all you've got? Come on, try\nagain.\" The ghostly face on the belly of\nthe vengeful mother seemed to have never\nexpected that this tiny human could\nwithstand its full force soul shriek.\nWhen it saw Fong Yu mocking it again, it\nopened its huge mouth in anger, and\ncountless vengeful spirits swarmed out\nof its mouth and rushed straight towards\nFong Yu. Seeing the massive number of\nvengeful spirits cascading down like a\nwaterfall, Fong Yu smiled slightly. This\nwas exactly what he wanted. Fong Yu then\nraised the elegy of the dead in his hand\nand 40 purple light chains shot out. The\ncycle of enslavement, absorption, and\nupgrading began. Your artifact, undead\nelegy, has been upgraded to three stars.\nCurrently, you can enslave 80 undead.\nYour artifact, Undead Elegy, has been\nupgraded to four stars. Currently, you\ncan enslave 160 undead. Your artifact,\nUndead Elegy, has been upgraded to five\nstars. Currently, you can enslave 320\nundead. Your artifact, Undead Elegy, has\nbeen upgraded to six stars. Currently,\nyou can enslave 640 undead. After Fong\nYu&lt;unk&gt;s artifact was upgraded to six\nstars, the thousands of vengeful spirits\nthat rushed towards him from midair were\nall swept away while the remaining 200\nor so vengeful spirits floated around\nFongu, turning their heads to stare at\nthe abyss vengeful mother above their\nheads. At this moment, the abyss wraith\nmother's size, which was nearly 100 m,\nhad shrunk considerably, becoming less\nthan 50 m. The expression on the ghost\nface on its abdomen gradually changed\nfrom ferocious to puzzled and finally to\nfear. Fongu looked at the terrified\nghost face and smiled slightly. That's\nit. I haven't even started to enjoy\nmyself yet. And you're already done.\nKeep going. Don't stop. The ghostly face\non the belly of the abyss wraith mother\nstared at Fong Yu for a moment. And then\na figure fell from its mouth. The\nwraiths that were about to attack were\nstunned and stopped when they saw the\nfigure. Just as Fong Yu was wondering\nwhat was going on, the figure landed in\nfront of him. In the fire light, Fong Yu\ndiscovered that the figure looked\nexactly like him, and even the equipment\non his body was identical. If I had to\npoint out a difference, it would be that\nthe figure's eyes held a hint of\nviolence and cruelty. Fongu realized\nthat this must be the second skill of\nthe abyss vengeful mother, Mirror of\nEvil, which replicated his own image.\nSo, you're planning to fight me\noneon-one? Fongu raised an eyebrow and\nsmiled helplessly. This trick might be\nuseful for people without defensive\ntreasures and weapons, but for him, it\nwas just another undead to upgrade his\nring. Then, a purple chain flew out, and\nthis imposing replica was enslaved by\nthe elegy of the undead. After all, this\nthing can only replicate Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s\nappearance and at most his abilities,\nbut it can never replicate the divine\nartifacts he possesses. Therefore, with\nthe soul elegy protecting him, Fongu\ncould naturally manipulate this replica\nevil spirit at will. It must be said\nthat this divine artifact ring, elegy of\nthe soul, is absolutely effective\nagainst soul-based monsters like the\nAbyss Mother. Seeing that her last\nresort had failed to achieve any effect,\nthe abyss mother of vengeance despaed\nand began to rise, trying to escape,\ntrying to run, Fong Yu smiled coldly and\nimmediately found the soul blade that\nhad fallen to the ground by relying on\nhis connection with the soul blade. Then\nhe released the dance of wind on himself\nand led the more than 200 vengeful\nspirits around him to kill the abyss\nvengeful mother in midair. Do you think\nyou can get away? after wielding the\nsoul blade to slice open the abdomen of\nthe abyss mother. Funu, confident in his\ndivine artifact protection, directly\nentered the mother's belly, intending to\nfind its core weakness and kill this\ncalamity monster from district 7. As\nsoon as he entered the body of the\nwraith mother, Fong Yu heard the shrieks\nof countless vengeful spirits.\nImmediately, the elegy of the dead at\nhis fingertips automatically shot out\nhundreds of chains, binding the vengeful\nspirits that were trying to pounce on\nhim. Because the light inside the\nvengeful mother's body was too dim, Fong\nYu had no choice but to retract his soul\nblade and begin summoning the fire\ndragon technique. As the dazzling and\nscorching fire dragon appeared, the\nappearance inside the vengeful mother's\nbody finally came into Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s\nview. Countless vengeful spirits\nintertwined. Countless pale arms, legs,\nand twisted bodies mixed together,\nalmost filling all the space inside this\nvengeful mother's body. These vengeful\nspirits must all be souls devoured by\nthe abyss mother of vengeance. Fongu\noriginally thought that the evil spirits\ninside the abyss mother of vengeance had\nbeen almost completely consumed. But who\nknew that there were still so many\nhidden inside? The scene before him was\nenough to make anyone with trypophobia\nshudder. Even Fong Yu, whose willpower\nwas superior to that of ordinary people,\ncouldn't help but gasp inwardly. This\nterrifying sight was probably something\nthat could only be seen in hell. For\nFong Yu, a former supernatural novelist,\nthis scene didn't frighten him at all.\nInstead, it gave him a lot of\ninspiration. Unfortunately, he doesn't\nhave the time or energy to write novels\nnow. However, if he gets old in the\nfuture, he can write an autobiography\nlike Bilbo Baggins for fun. But Fong Yu\nhad no time to appreciate this bizarre\nscene. He needed to quickly find the\ncore weakness of this abyss vengeful\nmother and then deliver a fatal blow to\nit. So, he began to control the fire\ndragon to wander around inside the\nWraith mother's body. But after\nwandering around for a while, apart from\nburning many wraiths to death, he could\nnot find the wraith mother's core. At\nthat moment, Fong Yu had a sudden\ninspiration. He didn't know, but these\nenslaved vengeful spirits should know.\nWhy not just let them find it?\nTherefore, Fong Yu issued a command to\nthe hundreds of vengeful spirits\nwandering around him through the elegy\nof the dead in order to find the core of\nthe vengeful mother. Sure enough, after\nreceiving the command, these vengeful\nspirits rushed towards a certain spot\nabove Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s head. Under the\nonslaught of hundreds of vengeful\nspirits, the countless layers of their\nlimbs were torn apart, revealing a huge\nand bloated ghost face at the very back.\nThat ghost face was almost identical to\nthe one Fong you had seen on the ground,\nwhich had been projected onto the\nvengeful mother's abdomen, but it was\neven more real. The bluish gray face was\ncovered with pumpkin-ized cysts, and\nwithin each cyst, one could vaguely see\na hideous twisted ghost face. Even more\ndisgusting was that the two huge eye\nsockets were filled with hundreds or\nthousands of eyeballs of all sizes. At\nthis moment, all those eyes were fixed\non Fong Yu below, their resentment and\nmalice evident. A woo! The enormous\nghostly face roared defiantly at Fong\nYu, and a stench wafted towards him. But\nFongu wasn't going to fall for that. He\ndirectly hurled the fire dragon hovering\nbeside him at the ghost face. Boom! The\nfire dragon struck the ghost face\ndirectly in the left eye socket. With a\nseries of eerie explosions, countless\neyeballs burst open instantly, spraying\nout a large amount of pus, which\nextinguished the fire dragon and also\nsprayed down towards Fongu below. Upon\nseeing this, Fongu knew that the pus was\nabsolutely not to be touched. So, he\nimmediately manipulated wind dance to\nmove to a different position and\nsummoned a second fire dragon to burn\nthe ghost face. This time he was\nsmarter. Instead of bombarding the ghost\nface's eye sockets, he poured the\ncontents into its open pitch black m.\nBoom! Another violent explosion rang out\nand a bright burst of fire erupted from\ninside the ghost face. Then the entire\nface exploded and as flames shot out,\ncountless dark vengeful spirits swarmed\nout from the shattered giant face and\nscattered in all directions. At the same\ntime, the entire body of the abyss\nmother began to tremble and contract.\nFong Yu sensed something was wrong and\nquickly flew towards the rift below. Not\nlong after he flew out of the body of\nthe vengeful mother, the vengeful\nmother's body, which was still nearly 50\nm long, suddenly began to swell after a\nviolent tremor. Then the grayish white\nskin on its surface began to crack in\npieces. Then with a deafening explosion,\nthe vengeful mother's huge body\ncompletely exploded. Fongu had already\nmoved far away. He looked at the\nshattered mother of vengeance and saw\ncountless vengeful spirits scattering in\nall directions and disappearing into the\nnight. Fongu didn't know if the\nscattered wrong souls would leave any\nfuture troubles, but at this moment, his\nmagic power was almost exhausted. after\nbarely using the dance of the wind to\nsend himself back to the ground. He\nreally didn't have the strength to chase\nafter those hundreds of wronged souls.\nIn addition, Fong Yu also noticed an\nobject shimmering with a fluorescent\nlight drifting down from midair, which\nappeared to be something that had been\ndropped by the abyss mother. The loot\ndropped by monsters of this level is\nbound to be good. So, Fong Yu\nimmediately headed towards the direction\nwhere the object was falling. Just then,\nFong Yu suddenly felt the ground beneath\nhis feet shake. Sensing something was\nwrong, he quickly dove aside. At the\nsame time, a sharp stone spike burst\nfrom the ground where Fong Yu had just\nbeen standing. Upon seeing the spike,\nFong Yu, who had leaped to the side,\nfrowned and immediately hid behind a\nnearby house. At the same time, he took\nout an invisibility cloak and put it on.\nthen took out a magic crystal and began\nabsorbing the magic power inside. He\nknew that the battle was not over yet.\nThe ground spike he had just used was a\nlow-level earth magic spell called\nground spike. Although it was low-level,\nit was quite lethal. If his agility had\nnot successfully broken through 10\npoints, exceeding the limits of ordinary\npeople, he might have been pierced\nthrough the heart by that sudden ground\nspike. After all, the shield of the\nundead's lament can only defend against\nsoul attacks, not magical attacks. So,\nwhile absorbing the magic power from the\nmagic crystal, Fong Yu began to observe\nhis surroundings. Without a doubt, the\none who attacked me with magic just now\ncould only be Li Yu Ya. I can't believe\nhe's still alive. But the more this was\nthe case, the happier Fong You became\nbecause it meant that the defensive\ntreasure on Li Yu Ya&lt;unk&gt;s body was of a\nhigher grade. Since you didn't take\nadvantage of the chaos to escape, Fong\nYu sneered inwardly. Then I'll take your\nlife and your treasures. Chapter 175.\nThe more they fought, the more the army\ngrew. At this moment, Fong Yu looked\naround and saw that the ground in Hong\nKo village was littered with corpses\nwith twisted expressions. Their souls\nhad been devoured by evil spirits which\nhad scattered in all directions with the\ndeath of the abyss vengeful mother.\nThere are probably very few survivors\nleft in the entire village. It looks\ncompletely desolate. After looking\naround, Fongu did not find any trace of\nLu and Ya. It seemed that the guy was\nhiding in some corner, waiting for him\nto show up. Meanwhile, the abyssal\nwraith mother's item, which had been\nfloating down from midair, slowly landed\non the ground, emitting a faint glow as\nif telling those around, \"I am a\ntreasure. Come and lick me.\" However,\nFong, you certainly wouldn't lick the\nboots in the current situation since\nthere's still an old coin lurking in the\nshadows. Sigh. Another coin toss of\npatience. I don't have the patience to\nplay along with you. So, Fong Yu called\nLie Chun Long in the chat channel,\nexplained the situation, and asked him\nto bring Olivia into the village. It's\nfoolish to not use teammates you have.\nSoon, Lie Chun Long rode his huge earth\ndragon into the village, and Olivia\njumped off the dragon's back, relying on\nthe connection between master and\nservant. She knew Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s\nlocation. All that was left was to find\nLi Yu Ya&lt;unk&gt;s location. Olivia is\nimmortal, so she can basically ignore\ndamage except for light magic, fire\nmagic, and soul attacks. Lie is wearing\nthick armor and is protected by an earth\ndragon, so he can be said to be very\ndurable. So, the two of them began to\nsearch for Lie Yu and Ya&lt;unk&gt;s\nwhereabouts in the village. With these\ntwo attention-grabbing figures moving\naround the village, Fong Yu finally\nemerged from his hiding corner,\npreparing to approach the object dropped\nby the abyss mother. But after taking\nonly a few steps, Fong Yu suddenly\nrealized something. If he couldn't\nresist wanting to take such an\nattractive treasure, then Lu and Ya must\nalso be keeping a close eye on it.\nTherefore, Fong Yu changed his mind and\ndecided to lure the snake out of its\nhole. At this moment, Fong Yu had\nrecovered 40 points of magic power\nthrough the magic crystal. So, he\ncarefully walked to the vicinity of the\ndropped item and then used Wind Wave to\nteleport the treasure on the ground to a\nhouse. Sure enough, a few seconds later,\na fire dragon emerged from the wooden\nhouse not far away and flew straight\ntowards the house where Fongu had kept\nthe treasure. Boom! The fire dragon\nexploded after it entered the wooden\nhouse and the entire house was engulfed\nin flames in an instant. Even as Fong Yu\nwas about to rush towards the wooden\nhouse where Li Yu Yao was hiding, a\nsecond fire dragon flew out of the house\nand once again entered the wooden house\nwhere Fong Yu kept his treasures. Piss,\nFong Yu gasped. This guy is really\nruthless. He was afraid I wouldn't die.\nSo, he actually fired a final shot.\nHowever, Li Yu Ya ultimately\nmiscalculated because Fong Yu had\nalready rushed to the wooden house where\nhe was hiding and finished chanting the\nfire dragon spell. The burning fire\ndragon instantly rushed into the wooden\nhouse where Li Yu Ya was hiding. Boom!\nFong Yu followed Lie Yu Ya&lt;unk&gt;s example\nand detonated the fire dragon directly,\ncausing flames to erupt in the wooden\nhouse in an instant. A moment later, a\nfigure climbed out of the window of the\nwooden house. Judging from his clothes\nand the light shield on his body that\nflickered to protect him from the\nflames. This person must be Lie Yu Ya.\nAt this moment, Lie Chun Long and Olivia\nalso arrived and together with Fong Yu\nsurrounded Lu and Ya. Let's&lt;unk&gt; see\nwhere you can hide now. Liun, the most\nimpatient of them all, roared and thrust\nhis dragon spear at Liu and Ya. Olivia\nalso charged forward with her iron ax.\nAnd Fong Yu, of course, was not idle\neither. He also drew his black gold\nancient sword and charged forward. Under\nthe combined attack of the three, the\nflickering light barrier finally\nshattered, and Lie Yu Ya died under Fong\nYu&lt;unk&gt;s blade with a look of resentment\nin her eyes. Fong Yu naturally wouldn't\nlet Li Yuan Ya, who was stubbornly\nresisting, die so easily. He directly\nused the Elegy of the Dead to lock up Li\nYu Ya&lt;unk&gt;s soul, which had just left\nhis body, and enslaved it. Then he had\nOlivia resurrect his corpse, making it a\nmember of the zombie army. Of course,\nFong Yu also didn't forget to search Li\nYuya's body and find the defensive\ntreasure he had been longing for, a\nseemingly ordinary stone, the\nArchmidge's Guardian Stone. Orange\nlegendary forged by Arch Mage Antonio\nhimself. This guardian stone can defend\nagainst all physical, magical, and\nspiritual damage, but requires mana to\nsustain it. It has a base mana reserve\nof 200 points, which can be recharged\nusing the archmid's own mana. Once the\nmana is depleted, the protective barrier\ndisappears. The barrier's area can be\nexpanded or shrunk at will with a\nmaximum diameter of 200 m and a minimum\nsize that fits the individual. Really?\nFongu smiled slightly. This was actually\na legendary treasure, second only to a\ndivine artifact. However, Fong Yu\nnoticed the name of this archmitch,\nwhich seemed to be from the same person\nas the storage ring on his hand. It\nseemed that this arch mage must have\nbeen a very remarkable magician in the\npast. After dealing with Li Yuya, Fong\nYu arrived at the wooden house where the\ntreasure was kept, which had been burned\ndown. He used water magic to summon a\nstream of water to extinguish the flames\nand retrieve the treasure dropped by the\nabyss vengeful mother from inside. Demon\nSpirit Crystal, Purple Epic, a rare\ntreasure from the depths of the demon\nrealm. It has an excellent nourishing\neffect on the soul and can automatically\nabsorb energy from the surrounding\nenvironment and convert it into soul\npower. It is a favorite of necromancers.\nUpon seeing this description, Fongu\nsmiled slightly. He knew Valentina would\ndefinitely like this item, so he would\ndefinitely give it to her when he got\nback. It should help her recover her\nstrength more quickly. After collecting\nall the treasures, Fong Yu had Li Chun\nLong and Olivia clean up the\nbattlefield. Lie Chun Long was\nresponsible for looting the bags of the\ndead players, while Olivia was\nresponsible for reviving the corpses of\nthe dead players. An hour later, the\nbattlefield was completely cleared. Lie\nShan Long looked at the more than 600\nextra zombies and exclaimed, \"Boss,\nyou're amazing. Usually the army gets\nsmaller and smaller as the battle goes\non, but yours just keeps growing. He\nFong Yu smiled slightly and said, \"You\nhave to keep this a secret from me\nfirst. After all, these zombies are easy\nto be criticized by those who don't know\nthe truth. You know what I mean? I\nunderstand. I understand.\" Lie Chun Long\nnodded repeatedly and said, \"Now I\nfinally know how you wiped out two\nmilitary camps in District 5 overnight.\nWith such a powerful force, the future\nlooks very promising. Keep a low\nprofile. Keep a low profile.\" So Fong Yu\nled everyone on their journey home.\nChapter 176. The Female Ghosts Little\nGame. Just as Fong Yu and his group were\nheading back from District 7, the Ghost\nManor was greeted by a group of\nuninvited guests. In the wild boar\nforest west of the manor, Charles\nLuther, with blonde hair, waved to stop\nthe 300man group behind him. He glanced\nat the quiet manor outside the forest\nand the faint light coming from the\nmanor's wooden cabins and squinted\nslightly. He wasn't sure if Fongu was in\nthe manor, but since he was already\nthere, he couldn't possibly give up\nhalfway. If Fongu were in the manor,\nthat would be ideal, as we could kill\nhim in one fell swoop. If he's not here,\nthen rob all the resources from his\nestate and burn it down. In any case,\nit's a sure thing. So, under Charles's\ncommand, the 300 men began to move\nthrough the woods, surrounding the manor\nfrom all four sides. Meanwhile, in the\nkitchen of the manor cabin, Valentina,\nwho was preparing a late night snack for\nFong Yu, seemed to sense something. She\nput down the spatula she was controlling\nwith her mental power, revealed a\nstrange smile and said softly, \"Someone\nhas actually come knocking on our door.\"\nValentina then walked out of the\nkitchen, went to the front door, opened\nit, and floated out where she saw\nCharles rushing towards the door. When\nCharles saw that the woman who pushed\nopen the door and walked out was a\nbeautiful woman with silver hair, he\npaused for a moment, called out to the\npeople behind him. \"Who are you?\"\nCharles demanded while also scrutinizing\nthe alluring woman, his eyes revealing\nprimal desire. Valentina looked at the\nblonde man and the people behind him\nwith interest and asked casually, \"And\nwho are you?\" Charles gave a cold laugh,\nignoring Valentina's question and\ninstead said directly, \"Where's Fongu?\nTell him to come out.\" \"Oh, you're\nlooking for your master.\" Valentina\nblinked her deep, pale purple eyes and\nasked, \"What do you need him for?\" At\nthat moment, a tall, burly, bearded\nplayer next to Charles shouted, \"Off.\nWe're here to take his life.\" \"I see.\"\nValentina raised an eyebrow, revealing a\nplayful smile, and said lightly. \"In\nthat case, I won't stand on ceremony.\"\nValentina's words immediately drew\nlaughter from the men who had surrounded\nher, \"You're welcome.\" Charles looked at\nValentina with a lewd grin. \"How exactly\ndo you want to be respectful? I'm\nlooking forward to it.\" That's right. My\nbrothers are all very strong and sturdy.\nYou mustn't be shy about taking\nadvantage of them. Are you going to\npunch your brother's chest with your\nlittle fists? Haha.\nJust as these men were all looking at\nValentina, who was surrounded by them\nwith ill intent, Valentina's charming\neyes suddenly narrowed, and a bright\npurple light burst forth from her whole\nbody. Then, a purple six-pointed star\nmagic circle appeared on her forehead.\nThe next second, an invisible shock wave\nof mental shock emanated from Valentina\nand rushed towards the surrounding men,\nleaving these unsuspecting men stunned.\nThen Valentina said to the ground,\n\"Let's do it.\" As soon as Valentina\nfinished speaking, hundreds of purplish\nblack tentacles burst forth from the\nground. The long sharp tentacles pierced\ndirectly between the men's legs,\nchurning and pulling out a pile of\ninternal organs. The thick tentacles\nthen wrapped around the dizzy men,\ntightening abruptly and strangling them\nto death with a series of cracking\nsounds. From the moment Valentina\nunleashed her psychic shock wave until\nthe tentacles finished their attack,\nless than 10 seconds had passed, and 295\nof the 30 burly men who had stormed into\nthe haunted manor were already dead.\nValentina was unsure of these people's\npurpose in coming to the manor and their\nrelationship with Fong Yu, which is why\nshe didn't let the demonic vine attack\nwhen these men first entered the manor,\nthus delaying the attack until now. The\nreason she left six people alive was\nbecause she planned to hand them over to\nFongu for interrogation. The remaining\n295 corpses were dragged into the ground\none by one by the tentacles, and their\nsoul power was being devoured by\nValentino one by one. At this moment,\nthe six surviving men were suspended\nabove the ground, entangled by the six\nthickest tentacles. They all stared in\nterror at the silver-haired female demon\nin midair who was devouring soul power,\ntheir eyes filled with despair. They\noriginally thought this seemingly weak\nand beautiful woman would be at their\nmercy, but they never expected that she\nwas the one with the knife, and they\nwere just the fish on the chopping\nblock. Charles was one of the six\nsurvivors. Although he had acquired the\nphysique of a vampire by chance, he was\nonly a low-ranking lordle vampire, it\nwas impossible for him to break free\nfrom the tree trunk thick tentacle on\nhis body. At this moment, he simply\ncouldn't understand why there were so\nmany terrifying tentacles underground in\nthis manner. Even more terrifying was\nthe seemingly frail woman who was\nfloating in midair, devouring the souls\nof the dead. Valentina quickly devoured\nthe souls of the dead, then floated to\nthe six survivors. She conjured a thorny\nwhip with magic in her hand and smiled,\nsaying, \"Do you know why I spared the\nlives of the six of you?\" All six people\nshook their heads in fear. Then\nValentina floated up to Charles and said\nwith a playful tone, \"You want my\nmaster's life, don't you?\" After saying\nthat, the female ghost raised the short\nwhip in her hand and lightly lashed the\nman's body as if she were flirting.\nHowever, when the whip touched Charles's\nbody, a sharp pain he had never felt\nbefore made his whole body tense up. He\nopened his mouth to scream, but the\nmuscles in his throat were too tense to\nmake a sound. It wasn't until a few\nseconds later, after his body had\nadapted to the pain, that he let out a\nfaint, inhuman scream as he gasped for\nbreath. This is the power of the\nspirit-piercing whip, which can directly\ndamage the soul. Although the damage is\nnot high, it can cause the most intense\npain, making it one of the most popular\ntorture instruments among necromancers\nin this world. Then the female ghost\nfloated in front of the second man and\nsmiled seductively at him, saying, \"You\njust said you were very strong and\nmuscular, right?\" After saying that, the\nfemale ghost gently flicked the whip in\nher hand onto the burly boy's body.\nLooking at this scene, an outsider might\nthink it was some kind of special little\nromance. But Charles, who was still\nscreaming in agony, was telling the\nremaining five people with the facts\nthat the whip was not a pleasant thing\nto be had. Sure enough, a few seconds\nlater, after experiencing extreme pain,\nthe burly man let out a scream like an\nold quail, which terrified the remaining\nfour people who turned pale and trembled\nlike leaves. So Valentino went to the\nthird man and asked, \"You just said you\nwanted me to punch you in the chest with\nmy little fists, right?\" \"No, no, no.\nPlease, please let me explain.\" The man\nin front of her hurriedly tried to\nexplain, but Valentina simply waved her\nhand slightly, and his mouth was\nsuddenly clenched shut by an invisible\nforce, making it impossible for him to\nopen it. Then Valentina raised her free\nhand, twirled her long, slender fingers,\nand smiled seductively at the terrified\nman, saying, \"Then I'll grant your\nwish.\" After saying that, Valentina\npunched the man in the chest. Just when\nthe man thought that the female demon's\npunch would kill him or seriously injure\nhim, he found that her fist had actually\npenetrated his chest. Immediately, the\nman felt a cold hand grip his heart and\nthen squeeze it tightly. What does it\nfeel like to have your heart squeezed?\nIt's a suffocating feeling that makes\nyou feel powerless all over. The stopped\nheart causes the blood in your body to\nlose its power, and the man feels his\nwhole body rapidly becoming numb, cold,\nand suffocating. At that moment, the\nfemale ghost released her grip on his\nheart and smiled sweetly again, saying,\n\"Do you still like me to punch your\nchest with my little fists?\"\nThe man, whose face was purplish red, no\nlonger had the strength to speak. He\nclung to his last breath for a long time\nuntil his heart started beating again,\nat which point he took another breath\nand came back to life. Then the female\nghost floated toward the fourth man.\nWhen the fourth man saw the female ghost\nfloating towards him, he was terrified\nand struggled violently, shouting, \"I\ndidn't say anything. I didn't say\nanything.\" Valentina looked at the man\nand smiled faintly. Although you didn't\nsay anything, the look in your eyes just\nnow was the most LWD of all, so I should\npunish you a little, right? As she\nspoke, Valentina raised the short whip\nin her hand and lightly flicked it\ntowards the man's groin. A few seconds\nlater, a sharp, piercing scream echoed\nthrough the woods, startling several\nsleeping birds away. Then, Valentino\nwalked toward the fifth man. Upon seeing\nValentina floating towards him, the\nfifth man was so frightened that he wet\nhimself. He cried and begged Valentina\nfor mercy, hoping she would spare him.\nJust then, Valentina seemed to sense\nsomething, turned to look at the woods\nto the west, then withdrew the\nspirit-piercing whip from her hand, and\nsmiled slightly at the fifth and sixth\nmen, saying, \"You two are lucky. The\nmaster has returned, so I won't make\nthings difficult for you.\" Upon hearing\nthis, the last two men felt as if they\nhad been granted a pardon and burst into\ntears of joy. \"However, don't tell your\nmaster about the little game I just\nplayed with you,\" the female ghost said\ncoldly, glancing at the six people. \"If\nyou talk nonsense, I'll let you\nexperience a little game that's 100\ntimes more painful than what you just\nplayed.\" Just then, Fun Yu emerged from\nthe woods to the west. Valentina\nimmediately put on a pitiful expression,\nnervously drifting towards Fong Yu and\ncalling out in a sweet, soft, and weak\nvoice, \"Master, you finally come.\"\nImmediately, the female goes through\nthrew herself into Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s arms,\nwho was caught off guard and cried out\nin a voice trembling with sobs. So many\nbad guys suddenly broke into the manor\njust now. They scared me so much.\nChapter 177. A new chosen one appears.\nWhen Fong Yu heard Valentina say that\nmany bad guys had broken into the manor,\nhe was startled. He quickly comforted\nthe female ghost in his arms and then\nrushed into the manor. At this moment,\nOlivia glanced at the female ghost and\nsaid indifferently, \"How many did you\nkill?\" \"295,\nsix of which were kept for the master to\nquestion,\" Valentina said calmly,\nabandoning her pitiful demeanor. \"Eh, it\nseems I absorbed quite a bit of soul\npower this time. It's all right, but\nthere's still a long way to go before I\ncan fully recover my physical body. When\nFong Yu rushed into the manor, he\nbreathed a sigh of relief upon seeing\nthe blood stains all over the ground,\nand the six people bound by tentacles.\nIt seemed that the enemy's sneak attack\nhad not caused any damage to the manor.\nFong Yu then approached the six bound\nmen, glanced at them, and asked, \"Who\nare you?\" The six people looked at each\nother without saying a word. But at that\nmoment, the female ghost floated behind\nFong Yu and coldly glanced at the six\npeople. Immediately, the man began to\nspeak eagerly. \"Hi, my name is Rogers\nDaer.\" \"Me? I'm a player from District\n4. My name is Joseph. I was wrong.\nPlease let us go. W I'll never do it\nagain.\" Fa was somewhat surprised to see\nthe six people suddenly change their\nexpressions and back down, but he didn't\nthink too much about it and continued to\nask. from district 4. Why would someone\nfrom district 4 come to my manor so late\nat night? So five of them turned to\nCharles Luther, the leader, and in order\nto save their lives and suffer less,\nthey began to turn on him. It's him. It\nwas Charles who brought us here. Yes.\nYes, it's him. He said a man named Fong\nYu killed several hundred of our people,\nso he brought us here to take revenge.\nHe's a liar. He said this manor had no\nguards. But when we arrived, we were He\nquickly stopped speaking and changed his\nwords. We were all killed by those\nterrifying tentacles. Hearing this,\nFongu understood the whole story. He\nnodded, looked at the blonde man named\nCharles, and asked, \"So, you're the\nmastermind behind this operation?\"\nCharles looked at Fong Yu with some\nnervousness. This was the first time he\nhad seen Fongu face to face. He never\nimagined that a terrifying being who\ncould single-handedly defeat the four\ndistricts of three, four, five, and\nseven was actually a seemingly frail\nyoung man. So, you dare to cause trouble\non my turf with only 300 men? Funu\nlaughed. Who gave you the courage?\nSeeing that the guy didn't speak, Funu\ndidn't bother to ask any more questions.\nHe glanced at the six men and said in a\ndetached tone, \"I need someone who can\nprovide me with information about\nDistrict 4. As for the rest, they're\nunnecessary. You understand what I mean,\nright?\" Upon hearing this, apart from\nCharles, the other five players\nimmediately vied to claim that they\ncould provide information. Seeing this,\nFongu chuckled and said, \"You've put me\nin a difficult position. Here's what I'm\ngoing to do. Whoever can kill the other\nfive people will be the one to survive.\nWith that, Fong Yu gestured for Emo Tong\nto release the six people and then said,\n\"All right, start your performance.\" So,\nthe five players exchanged glances,\npicked up their weapons, and surrounded\nCharles. They knew that Charles was the\nstrongest of the six, and only by taking\nhim down would they have a chance to\nsurvive. Charles looked at the five men\nsurrounding him. A fierce glint flashing\nin his eyes. Sharp fangs appeared\nbeneath his lips and his fingernails\nbegan to sharpen. Fongu was slightly\ntaken aback when he saw this scene, not\nexpecting that this guy would actually\ntransform. Olivia, who was standing\nnearby, reminded him he's a vampire, the\none who flew away and escaped from the\nmilitary camp last time. Fly away and\nescape. Upon hearing this, Funu\nimmediately sensed something and\ninstantly unleashed a windb blade. Sure\nenough, the next second, Charles, who\nseemed to be preparing to fight to the\ndeath, suddenly pounced on the five\npeople. But during the pounce, a pair of\nfleshy wings suddenly extended from his\nback, and he flew into the air in a\nflash. Seeing this, Fong Yu immediately\nshot a wind blade at Charles in midair,\nbut Charles dodged it with a nimble\ndodge. Just when Charles thought he\ncould escape, suddenly, more than a\ndozen wind blades attacked him. Even\nwith Charles's excellent agility, he\ncouldn't dodge the attack of more than a\ndozen windb blades. His two fleshy wings\nwere cut off, and his body was pierced\nby five or six wind blades. Ah! Charles\nlet out a scream and fell to the ground.\nFunu looked at Valentina beside him and\nexclaimed, \"Amazing, Tina. You were able\nto unleash so many wine blades at once.\"\nValentina smiled slightly and said,\n\"This is the advanced wind magic dance\nof the gale. You will be able to learn\nit once you upgrade to an advanced\nmage.\" Fongu nodded, then turned to the\nfive players and said, \"What are you all\nstanding there for? Don't you know how\nto seize such a good opportunity?\" Upon\nhearing this, the five players\nimmediately realized what was happening\nand rushed towards Charles, who was\nstill struggling on the ground. They\nhacked the arrogant vampire to death\nwith their knives. They even knew the\nvampire's weakness and cut off Charles's\nhead before stopping. So, only five\nplayers remained in the arena. After\nexchanging glances, they knew they\ncouldn't escape and could only start\nfighting each other. 3 minutes later,\nthe last most robust male player\ndragging his battered body approached\nFong Yu and asked, \"Now, can you let me\ngo?\" Fong Yu smiled slightly and said,\n\"Are you mistaken? What I just said was\nthat the last one to survive would be\neligible to live, but I didn't say that\nI would let you go. After a moment of\nsilence, the burly man threw away his\nblood dripping long sword, knelt before\nFong Yu, and bowed his head, saying, \"I\nam willing to become your servant.\" Upon\nhearing this, Fong Yu asked with great\ninterest. \"Then how do you guarantee\nyour loyalty? I swear to God, no, no,\nno.\" Fong Yu waved his hand and said\ncalmly, \"I don't believe in God.\" \"So,\nwhat exactly do you want?\" The burly man\nroared. \"I do have a method,\" Fongu said\nwith a slight smile. \"It can not only\nsolve the loyalty problem, but also\nallow you to become the Lord of District\n4 in the future. Do you want to give it\na try?\" The burly man was slightly taken\naback upon hearing this and asked,\n\"Become the lord of District 4? What\nmethod is that? a method that will make\nyou feel like you're dying and coming\nback to life. Immediately, a wind blade\npierced through the man's temple,\nkilling him without any pain. Then,\nFongu carried the strong man's body to\nthe manor cemetery and threw the body\ninto a coffin. With a flash of green\nlight, the coffin disappeared into the\nsoil. A moment later, the burly man\npushed open the coffin and sat up. He\npaused for a moment as if receiving some\ninformation, then turned to look at Fong\nYu who was smiling. He took a deep\nbreath, knelt down on one knee in front\nof Fong Yu, and said, \"Chris Odinsen\npledges his allegiance to you, my\nmaster.\" Having gained experience in\nmaking Sonata Sari, the lord of district\n7, Fongu realized that his previous\nmethod of kidnapping lords from other\ndistricts was flawed. The best way is to\nfirst find a player in the target area,\nresurrect him as an undead loyal to you.\nThen give him enough resources to become\nthe entire area, and then just kill the\noriginal lord. This is why Fong Yu kept\nChris around. Looking at the muscular\nman who was half a head taller than him,\nFong Yu smiled slightly and said, \"Now\nthat we're on the same side, I have to\napologize to you first. I'm sorry for\nkilling you just now.\" After a moment of\nsilence, Chris said in a deep voice, \"I\nunderstand what you're doing. If it were\nme, I would have done the same.\" Haha.\nGood that you understand. Long live\nunderstanding. Funu laughed. Well, then\nlet's have a good chat about how to make\nyou the lord of District 4. Come on,\nlet's go inside first. Tina, have you\nprepared any midnight snacks? Upon\nhearing this, Valentina immediately\ncovered her mouth and exclaimed in\nsurprise, \"Oh no, I forgot to turn off\nthe heat when I was cooking your steak.\"\nWith that, Valentina floated toward the\nwooden house, \"Haha, no problem. We can\nhave barbecue if necessary.\" After\nsaying that, Fongu looked at Chris and\nsaid, \"Let's go. Let's eat and talk at\nthe same time.\" After returning to the\nhouse, Fongu learned about the situation\nin District 4 from Chris. Lord St. Paul\nLuther of District 4 is the older\nbrother of Charles Luther, the vampire\nwho was just killed. St. Paul knew about\nCharles's actions tonight, which means\nthat St. Paul must know that Fong Yu\nkilled his younger brother. On the one\nhand, the raid on Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s manner\nwas carried out under the orders of St.\nPaul, so Fong Yu would naturally\nremember this grudge. On the other hand,\nFong Yu killed St. Paul's younger\nbrother, so St. Paul would also remember\nthis grudge. Thus, this feud was\nofficially established. So, Fongu had\nChris share the location of the Sao\nPaulo territory on the map, preparing to\nfind time to reclaim that territory. At\nthis point, Chris said, \"Although\nCharles is rather foolish, his brother\nis a very shrewd man and received the\ninheritance of the light priest at a\nvery young age, so he is not so easy to\ndeal with.\" \"A priest of light? What's\nthat?\" Fongu asked curiously. Chris\nshook his head and said, \"It should be\nsome kind of professional inheritance,\nbut I don't know exactly what it is. All\nI know is that everyone who has seen him\nimmediately swore allegiance to him and\nbecame his devoted servant.\" At this\nmoment, Valentina emerged from the\nkitchen with a late night snack,\ncarrying it with her magic. She smiled\nand explained to Fong Yu, \"Master, the\npriest of light is a position in the\nHoly Sea of Light, second only to the\nPope. They are usually appointed by the\nangels of the divine realm. Priests of\nlight can not only use all light magic,\nbut also have the ability to borrow the\npower of the angels of the divine realm.\nTheir strength should not be\nunderestimated. Hearing this, Fongu\nfrowned. Judging from Chris and\nValentina's description, this Sao Paulo\nseemed to be incredibly lucky to have\nobtained such a top-notch professional\ninheritance. Suddenly, he had a guess.\nthe holy sea of light, the angelic race\nof the divine realm. Could it be that\nSao Paulo like himself is a chosen one?\nAt this moment, the game assistance\ninformation appeared. Congratulations.\nYou guessed right. St. Paul is also one\nof the chosen ones in this survival\ngame, and he's on your opposing side,\nthe representative of the god of light.\nUpon seeing the information from the\ngame assistant, Funu frowned deeply. He\nrealized that this Lord of District 4\nmight not be as easy to deal with as he\nhad thought. In fact, he might very well\nbe the biggest threat to him in the\ncoming period. Looks like I need to make\na proper plan. Chapter 178. Valentina's\nfavorability has reached 1,000. At the\ncenter of District 4. At top a mountain\nover 100 m high stands a palace entirely\nwhite. Below the mountain side are\nhouses in shades of gray and white\nstretching all the way to the foot of\nthe mountain which is then enclosed by a\ntowering city wall. This is a city built\non a mountain side and it is a city that\nhas not been destroyed and is inhabited.\nThe city is called White City but the\nresidents prefer to call it Bright City.\nAt this moment, inside the palace at top\nthe mountain, a handsome man bearing a\nstriking resemblance to Charles Luther\nsat on the throne in the center of the\npalace. He was none other than Charles\nLuther's brother, St. Paul Luther\nLuther. Beneath the throne, 12 men and\nwomen dressed in white robes were\nkneeling. \"Gentlemen, we need to make\nsome serious plans,\" said St. Paul\nsolemnly from his throne. Judging from\nthe message my disgraced brother sent me\nbefore he died, I think I can confirm\nthat the spokesperson for the god of\ndarkness is Fongu brush. The 12 men and\nwomen in white robes rose together,\nlooked up at St. Paul on the throne, and\nsaid in unison, \"By the God of light,\nmay you purify all darkness for our\nLord.\" Strangely, all 12 of them had\ngolden pupils and holy, solemn faces,\nunlike ordinary people. Upon hearing\nthis, St. Paul smiled faintly and said,\n\"Very good. Then let's&lt;unk&gt; begin our\nfirst plan. Let those lost sheep return\nto the embrace of the God of light.\"\nAfter finishing his late night snack,\nFong Yu suddenly realized that finding\naccommodation had become a new problem.\nThere are only three rooms in the house.\nWhen Sonata Sasari came yesterday, she\ncould squeeze in with Olivia. But today,\nthe new addition, Chris, is a burly man\nwho is nearly 1.9 m tall. Therefore,\nFongu felt it was time to upgrade his\nmanner. After all, he had used his honor\npoints to do 30 tin pulls and obtained\nbuilding materials worth hundreds of\nthousands, which was more than enough\nfor the upgrade. Haunted Manor twostar\nto three star. Six bedrooms, two living\nrooms, one kitchen, two bathrooms, one\nyard, two floors 120 sqm each. Yard 150s\nsqm. Upgrade requirements 129850/5000\nwood 85855/2000\ngravel 38150/800\nmud 33779/800\nvines 9355/500\niron ingots upgradeable. Thankfully this\nupgrade didn't require any strange or\nunusual things. Hm. They can upgrade a\none-story wooden house into a two-story\nwooden building. The area has doubled.\nThree more rooms. That's pretty good.\nWhat are you waiting for? Upgrade now.\nIn an instant, the entire wooden house\nbegan to shake. The wood automatically\ntransformed into planks, strips, and\npebbles, and the stones were piled up\ntogether. About 3 minutes later,\neverything settled down. Fa glanced\naround. The living room hadn't changed\nmuch, except that a wooden spiral\nstaircase leading to the second floor\nhad appeared in the corner. So, he went\nup the staircase to the second floor.\nThe layout of the second floor was\nbasically the same as the first floor,\nexcept that there was a balcony\nextending outwards from the front door.\nSo, Fong Yu went downstairs and said to\nChris, \"Just pick any room upstairs to\nrest tonight. I'll make the sheets and\nblankets and bring them up to you\nlater.\" Chris nodded, thanked Fong Yu,\nand went upstairs. After Chris went\nupstairs to his room, Valentina floated\nto Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s side and whispered,\n\"Master, do you plan to let him stay\nhere indefinitely?\" Fong Yu smiled\nslightly and said, \"No, he&lt;unk&gt;ll just\nstay here tonight. I'll arrange for him\nto go to King's Landing tomorrow.\nAlthough Chris is now an undead and\nbound by the game system, he is still\nnot familiar with him.\" Saying that he\nis just a tool might be a bit of an\nexaggeration, but he is far from being a\npartner living under the same roof.\nThat's good. Valentina smiled slightly.\nOtherwise, it would be a bit\ninconvenient for Vaia and me to have a\nstranger living here. Although Olivia\nand the ghost didn't get along, she\nshared Valentina's stance on this matter\nand nodded, saying, \"I agree.\" Fongu\nwaved his hand and said, \"All right, I\nunderstand. We&lt;unk&gt;ll arrange for him to\nleave tomorrow.\" After saying that,\nFongu looked at Valentina and smiled\nslightly. Oh, right. I almost forgot. I\nbrought you a gift. Then he took out the\nmagic crystal that the abyss vengeful\nmother had dropped from his storage ring\nand handed it to the female ghost.\nValentina looked down and immediately\nrecognized the gem. She gasped in\nsurprise, covering her mouth as she\nexclaimed, \"Uh, a demon spirit crystal.\nHow do you have this gem? It's a\ntreasure found only in the abyss of the\ndemon realm. Olivia, who was standing to\nthe side, rarely showed a smile and\nsaid, \"Tonight, master killed an abyss\nwraith mother all by himself. This magic\ncrystal is the core of the abyss wraith\nmother. The abyss wraith mother.\"\nValentina looked at Fong Yu in\ndisbelief. A mid-level mage had actually\nsingle-handedly killed an Abyss Wraith\nmother that was even more troublesome\nthan a dragon. If Olivia hadn't said it,\nthe female ghost probably wouldn't have\nbelieved it. That's incredible. How did\nyou do that? Fongu scratched his head,\nthen shily showed off the elegy of the\ndead on his finger and said, \"It's\nmainly thanks to it.\" After seeing the\nartifact, the elegy of the undead,\nValentina finally understood. Indeed,\nwith such an artifact that could be said\nto completely counter soul type enemies,\ndealing with an abyssal wraith mother\nwas understandable. However, the ever\nemotionally intelligent female ghost\nnaturally found a way to praise Fong Yu.\nAlthough this artifact is powerful, the\nfact that you, master, were able to face\nand defeat an abyss demon like the abyss\nmother all by yourself is something no\nordinary person could do. So, you are\ntruly remarkable. Hearing the ghostly\nwoman's sweet and charming praise, even\nwith Fongu's strong will, he couldn't\nhelp but feel a little flattered. He he\nkeep it low-key. Valentina used her\nmagic to take the magic crystal from\nFong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s hand and said excitedly,\n\"This thing is very helpful to me. Thank\nyou so much, master.\" At this moment,\nsome prompts from the assistants popped\nup. Ghost Valentina's affection level\nplus 200. Current affection level 1025.\nGhost Valentina's affection level with\nyou has reached 1,000. She might share\nsome secrets with you or something else\nmight happen between you. he. Just as\nFong Yu was staring blankly at the game\nassistants prompts, the female ghost\nsuddenly floated forward and kissed him\non the cheek. Although her spirit form\ncouldn't touch Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s physical\nbody, it could touch his soul. So Fong\nYu immediately felt a tingling sensation\non his cheek like being electrocuted.\nThis Fong Yu, a pure and innocent\nvirgin, couldn't resist such teasing. He\nraised his eyebrows slightly and said\nnervously, \"I'm going to sleep now.\"\nAfter saying that, he fled back to his\nbedroom. He Valentina chuckled softly as\nshe watched Fongu escape into the\nbedroom. Master is so adorable like\nthis.\nShameless woman. Olivia said this and\nthen turned and went into her room,\nslamming the door shut. Huh? Valentina\nraised an eyebrow and yelled at Olivia's\nroom. I'm not human. I'm an elf. I don't\nhave your human doctrines of morality\nand shame. Hypocritical woman. After\nsaying that, Valentina returned to her\nroom, preparing to use the magic crystal\nfong you had given her to begin her\ncultivation. With the help of this magic\ncrystal, she was confident that she\ncould restore her physical body within 3\ndays. Then Valentina chuckled dreily.\nMaster, you won't be able to escape.\nChapter 179. Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s views on\nrelationships. Back in his bedroom,\nFongu lay on his bed and began to ponder\na question. his relationship with the\nthree companions in the haunted house,\nespecially Olivia and Valentina.\nActually, although Fong Yu is an old\nvirgin, he is not stupid. Now that his\nIQ is over 10, he is actually very\nsmart. He was well aware that as the\nowner of this haunted house and the\nrepresentative of the dark god, he\nactually had absolute control over his\nthree companions and could make them do\nwhatever he wanted. But he didn't do\nthat because deep down he was a rather\ntraditional and introverted man. In that\nonce desperate city where scumbags were\neverywhere and playboys were as common\nas dogs, he seemed particularly out of\nplace. Even when I see a girl's gaze, I\nsubconsciously look away. Calling it\ngyophobia might be an exaggeration, but\nI do have some degree of social anxiety\ntowards the opposite sex. Perhaps\nbecause he read too many martial arts\nand fantasy novels as a child. Fong\nYu&lt;unk&gt;s views on love were also deeply\ninfluenced by the pure and beautiful\nlove stories in the martial arts and\nfantasy worlds. When he chose to pursue\na career in writing, he longed for a\npure and innocent love. But in that\nmaterialistic society with no house, no\nland, and a bleak future, what right did\nhe have to talk about love and romance?\nThis perfectly illustrates the saying,\n\"How can one with a life of poverty dare\nto enter a world of extravagance? How\ncan one with clean hands dare to mislead\na beautiful woman? That's why he's been\nsingle until now. Although he now\npossesses considerable strength in this\nsurvival world and has two beautiful\nwomen around him who are unlikely to\nreject him, his views on love remain\nunchanged. He still hopes to have a pure\nand innocent love. But both Olivia and\nValentina have an added master servant\nrelationship with themselves which makes\nit seem less pure. Fong Yu was still\nunsure of Olivia's feelings, but\nsubconsciously he had always considered\nher a buddy, so he hadn't thought about\nit in that way. Valentina's attitude\ntowards Fong Yu was almost obvious, but\nit was precisely Valentina's overly\nproactive behavior that made Fong Yu\nfeel resistant. He couldn't help but\nwonder if Valentina's initiative was\nsimply because she liked him. Obviously\nnot. The reason she was so proactive was\nbecause of her identity as the owner of\nthe haunted house and the spokesperson\nfor the god of darkness. If he weren't\nthe owner of this house, but just a\npasserby, Valentina probably wouldn't\neven give him a second glance. This is\nwhy Fong Yu always chooses to avoid\nValentina's advances. It's not the kind\nof love he wants, or at least it's not\nso pure. Admittedly, when faced with a\nvibrant, alluring female ghost, Fong Yu,\nas a normal man, would naturally have\nsome physiological reactions and\nimpulses, and his mind would often be\nfilled with wicked thoughts and desires.\nBut he would eventually suppress them\nbecause he didn't want to approach or\naccept a woman, or rather a female\nghost, because of that primal desire. If\nhe did, how would he be any different\nfrom an animal? In contrast, he felt\nvery comfortable with Olivia, perhaps\nbecause he subconsciously still viewed\nOlivia as a man. And Olivia's attitude\ntowards Fong Yu was also quite normal.\nOn the way back, Olivia had told Fong Yu\nthat with the magic crystal, Valentina\nshould be able to recover her physical\nbody quickly. This reminded Fong Yu that\nonce Valentina recovered, given her\npersonality and attitude towards him,\nthere was a 98% chance she would pounce\non him. Therefore, Fong Yu is now\nstarting to worry about what he should\ndo when that time really comes. Given\nValentina's strength, she'll probably\nhave a hard time escaping by then. He\ncould even picture Valentina using\nirresistible magic to control him on the\nbed, then climbing onto it with a wicked\ngrin. \"Alas, the world is so hard,\"\nFongu sighed. \"I feel like my chastity\nis in danger.\" \"So troubled,\" Fong Yu\ntossed and turned until he fell asleep.\nThe next morning, a sudden wave of\nsweltering heat woke Fong Yu from his\ndream. After feeling the temperature in\nthe room, Fong Yu realized that the\nfollowing summer had arrived. When Fong\nYu thought of summer, he remembered the\nannouncement the game system had made\nlast time. A lord's championship would\nbe held on the last day of summer, which\nwas 2 days from now. Although the\ncurrent Lord is Sanjuming, Fong Yu knows\nthat he has virtually no combat power.\nIf he wants to save Jimming&lt;unk&gt;s life\nand win the lord competition, he will\ndefinitely have to participate with him\nsince each lord can bring 10 citizens to\nparticipate. Moreover, judging from the\ncurrent situation, once we enter the\nlord's tournament, our district 6 and\nviking emperor's district 8 will\ndefinitely be targeted. Fortunately, the\ncurrent lord of district 7ari\nis also one of our own. If it is three\nagainst seven, although we are still at\na disadvantage, at least the\ndisadvantage will not be so great. Even\nso, he still couldn't let his guard down\nbecause Fongu remembered the information\nhe had just learned yesterday, the lord\nof district 4, St. Paul Luther, was also\none of the chosen ones. And moreover,\nthe spokesperson for the god of light\nwho was his enemy. So, his strength must\nbe very strong. Therefore, we don't know\nhow things will turn out. So, we can\nonly think of meticulous plans and\nsolutions in advance, which is a\nbrain-intensive task. Uggh. I have these\nannoying problems before I even go to\nsleep. And when I wake up, I have to\ndeal with these headacheinducing issues\nagain. Life is such a torment. Fong Yu\ncouldn't help but pat his forehead\ninside. This is also why Fong Yu was so\nreluctant to become a lord at first.\nThere were too many things to worry\nabout. He originally thought that\nletting Song Jimming be the Lord would\nallow him to be a hands-off manager who\ncould relax, but in fact, he has hardly\nhad a moment of rest these past few\ndays. He is busier than the donkey\npulling the millstone in the production\nbrigade. But what can I do? Since I've\nbeen forced to participate in the gamble\nbetween the god of light and the god of\ndarkness if I want to survive and win\nthis seemingly unwininnable gamble, I\nhave to be ruthless with myself and\nstrive for that sliver of hope to turn\nthings around. So keep it up, Fongu. You\ncan do it. After giving himself a pep\ntalk, Fongu got up, dressed, and\nsolemnly walked out of the bedroom,\nready to start a new day. After leaving\nthe bedroom, he saw the muscular honk. I\nmean the musclebound Chris sitting at\nthe dining table in the living room\nsaying to Olivia sitting opposite him\nimpossible. I can't possibly lose. What\nare you talking about? Fongu asked\ncuriously. Olivia glanced at Fong Yu and\nsaid calmly. I said that all the undead\nunder my master's command should be\nunder my control. But he disagreed and\nsaid that strength should be the\ndeciding factor based on strength. Fongu\nraised an eyebrow. Yes. I said no\nproblem. He can compete with me in\nanything. And then he said he wanted to\narm wrestle with me. And I said he was\nbound to lose. Arm wrestling. Holy crap.\nFongu exclaimed in surprise. You're a\ngrown man whose arm circumference is\nalmost as big as my leg circumference,\nand you actually want to arm wrestle\nwith a woman. Have you no shame?\nHowever, judging from Chris's serious\nexpression, he was prepared to abandon\nall pretense of decency in order to gain\nleadership. But then Fong Yu smiled\nslightly, walked over to Chris, patted\nhim on the shoulder, and said, \"Brother,\nyou're just humiliating yourself.\"\nChris, puzzled, looked up at Fong Yu,\ncompletely baffled. Fong Yu laughed, and\nsaid, \"All right, since you say you want\nto decide management by arm wrestling,\nthen let's do it your way and start\nnow.\" Chris then confidently raised his\nmuscular right arm, which had a\ncircumference of 56 cm, and placed it on\nthe table, challenging Olivia. I can let\nyou go first. Okay. Olivia nodded\ncalmly, raised her long, slender, white\narm, and said to Fong Yu, \"Master, may I\nborrow your gloves for a moment?\" H\nFongu was slightly takenback, but then\ntook out the pair of white magic gloves\nfrom his storage ring and handed them to\nOlivia. After Olivia put on her gloves,\nshe shook hands with Chris. \"Has it\nstarted?\" Olivia asked. \"Let's begin.\nYou can start now.\" Chris gave a\nconfident smile. However, the next\nsecond with a loud thump, Chris's arm\nhad been pressed onto the table by\nOlivia. And upon closer inspection, the\nangle of Chris's forearms bend appeared\nextremely strange, suggesting it was\nbroken. Seeing this, Olivia frowned\nslightly and said, \"Sorry, I didn't\ncontrol my strength properly.\" Chapter\n181day. Ascend to the god realm.\nSlaughter the gods. Haha. Fongu stood by\nthe table, almost laughing himself to\ndeath. He finally managed to stop\nlaughing and said to Chris, \"I told you\nyou're just humiliating yourself, and\nyou didn't believe me. She could carry\nme across a 10- m wide river. You\nactually think you can beat her in\nstrength?\" Haha. Chris straightened his\nbroken arm and looked at Fong Yu\nresentfully, saying, \"Why didn't you say\nso sooner?\" Fong Yu shrugged. \"Even if I\nhad told you earlier, I doubt you would\nhave believed me.\" After the farce\nended, Olivia began to teach Chris how\nto use the immortal energy within her to\nrepair his broken arm. While Valentina\nsmiled and magically carried breakfast\nout of the kitchen, seeing that seven or\neight dishes floated over with\nValentina, Fong Yu raised an eyebrow\nslightly and said, \"You actually made so\nmany.\" He he because I'm so happy today.\nValentina smiled and said, \"The magic\ncrystal that master gave me last night\nwas so useful, it almost doubled my\nrecovery speed.\" He he that's great.\nThen the female ghost slowly approached\nFong Yu and said in a charming tone,\n\"Master, you are so good to Tina. How\ncan Tina repay you?\" At this moment,\nOlivia rolled her eyes at the table.\nAlpha, who was chewing on a steak,\nalmost choked on it. Chris, who had just\nwitnessed Valentina's witch form last\nnight, was dumbfounded and even forgot\nto continue healing the injury on his\narm. If you really want to repay me,\nFun, you took two steps back and forced\na smile. Then try to recover your\nphysical body within 2 days because I\nhave to participate in a life or death\ncompetition in 2 days. Upon hearing\nthis, Valentina's expression immediately\nturned serious. And even Olivia and\nAlfa's expressions became solemn. Since\nit concerned Fong Yu's life and death,\nthey were very concerned. Chris wasn't\ntoo surprised because he knew about the\nLord's tournament, but his expression\nalso became serious. He knew that Fong\nYu was about to face the Lords of the\nother nine districts as well as the nine\nstrongest players from those nine\ndistricts. Valentina then floated back\nto the table and said earnestly, \"Please\ntell us the details, master.\" So Fong,\nyou sat down at the table and started\neating breakfast while talking to his\nthree friends about the Lord&lt;unk&gt;'s\nconquest tournament. As long as it\ndidn't involve anything related to the\ngame system itself, they could discuss\nit together. So, according to you, in 2\ndays, you will be participating in a\nsmall-scale battle that is very likely\nto be 30 against 70, and there will be\nvery powerful opponents among them.\nValentina concluded. Fongu nodded and\nsaid, \"30 to 70 is the ideal situation,\nbut it could also be 20 to 80. Of\ncourse, that's not the point. The point\nis that there's a guy among them who has\na grudge against me. He's the older\nbrother of the vampire we killed last\nnight. He's the spokesperson of the god\nof light and he's also a priest of\nlight. Olivia nodded in realization and\nsaid, \"So, the priest of light you\nmentioned last night was him.\" Upon\nhearing this, Olivia and Valentina both\nfrowned. If a priest of light was indeed\ninvolved, and from an opposing force at\nthat, then this tournament would be\ntruly difficult to win because the light\npriest's light magic is effective\nagainst the undead. the undead and even\nAlpha who is demon blood. Not to mention\nthat the light priest is the\nrepresentative of the god of light.\nSince Fong Yu as the representative of\nthe dark god can inherit such a haunted\nhouse and gain three powerful\ncompanions, then the representative of\nthe light god must also have powerful\ncompanions in the light faction.\nTherefore, the outcome is truly\nunpredictable. In that case, it seems I\nreally need to recover my physical body\nas soon as possible. Valentina said\nsolemnly. A mere undead soul is indeed\ndifficult to resist light magic. If I\nrecover my physical body, things will be\nmuch better. In that case, master, I\nwill go into seclusion to cultivate for\nthe next 2 days. I'll have to trouble\nyou to take care of the cooking for now.\nOh, what are you saying? Fongu replied.\nCooking wasn't your job to begin with.\nYou've been cooking for us for so long\nwithout eating a single bite yourself. I\nfeel really bad about it. Don't worry.\nI'll take care of the cooking from now\non. You can go into seclusion in peace.\nSo, the female ghost bid farewell to\neveryone and returned to her room. At\nthis moment, Olivia suddenly asked,\n\"Master, do you know where that\ntournament is located?\" \"Location? Did I\nforget to mention it?\" Fongu glanced at\nChris and said, \"If I remember\ncorrectly, it should be somewhere in\nthat ancient battlefield in the north.\"\nUpon hearing this answer, Olivia's eyes\nlit up slightly. And she replied, \"Are\nyou sure?\" At this moment, Chris said,\n\"Master is right. It is indeed that\nancient battlefield in the north. I\nremember it, too.\" \"If it's there,\"\nOlivia said with a faint smile. \"Then\nmaybe we really can win that\nchampionship match.\" Hm. Why do you say\nthat? Fongu asked puzzled. Olivia turned\nto look north, her gaze becoming vacant,\nas if traversing space to look at that\nmysterious ancient battlefield. Because\nthat ancient battlefield is where my\nformer subordinates are buried. Upon\nhearing this, Funu immediately\nunderstood Olivia's meaning and became\nexcited. They were all your former\nsubordinates. You mean your former\nmillion strong undead army. so you can\nresurrect that undead army.\" Olivia\nnodded, but her eyes began to droop\nslightly, and her expression gradually\nbecame sorrowful. \"Yes, we gathered\nthere back then, hoping to ascend to the\nheavens and fight our way to the realm\nof gods to defeat the angels, but in the\nend, I failed. I underestimated the\npower of the angels. And ultimately, my\nsoldiers were laid to rest forever on\nthat ancient battlefield.\" Chris's eyes\nwidened when he first heard about\nOlivia's background. He couldn't believe\nthat the person sitting in front of him\nwas a powerful figure who once commanded\nan army of millions of immortals.\nThinking about it, it was no wonder that\nhe lost to her in the arm wrestling\nmatch. As for Fong Yu, he immediately\nunderstood Olivia's melancholy. After\nall, those buried there were Olivia's\nformer followers. Her loyal subordinates\nhad all perished there because of her\ndesire to fight in the heavens. For her,\nthis was undoubtedly an incredibly heavy\nblow. She must feel deep remorse and be\nunable to let go of the guilt she felt\ntowards the fallen soldiers. Sigh. Fong\nyou sighed softly, comforting him. Let\nbygones be bygones. A temporary setback\ndoesn't mean a real defeat. Don't you\nstill have me? Believe me, one day I\nwill definitely lead you and your former\nsubordinates to storm the god realm and\nwipe away your shame. Chapter 181. a\npowerful enemy. At this moment, Fong Yu\nfinally understood why Olivia rarely\nsmiled. Millions of soldiers had died\nwith resentment in the battle to reach\nthe heavens, and she must have been\nsuppressing a huge sense of guilt and\nregret. After breakfast, to prevent the\nmanor from being attacked again, Funu\nleft Olivia and Alpha at the manor while\nhe prepared to send Chris to King's\nLanding. With Olivia stationed at the\nmanor, the more than 1,000 zombies in\nthe spider cave can be mobilized at any\ntime. Even if the Lord of District 4,\nSt. Paul Luther, came in person, he\nwould not be able to get away with it.\nBecause it was summer, the sun outside\nwas particularly scorching. Fongu\nspecially prepared two large linen\nheadscarves for himself and Chris to\nwrap around their upper bodies before\ngoing out. Fortunately, the journey to\nKing's Landing was mostly through\nforests, and they didn't leave the\nforest until they reached the 10 m wide\nriver. At this time, the stone bridge\nthat had collapsed by the river had been\nrepaired, presumably by Song Jimming.\nSo, the two hurriedly crossed the stone\nbridge and then went through a grove of\ntrees to reach the outskirts of King's\nLanding. From a distance, the outer city\nwalls have been almost completely\nrepaired, which suggests that Song\nJimming has established stable trade\nrelations with the Cobalts in the\neastern Rift Valley and has a sufficient\nsupply of stone. Four corner towers were\nbuilt at the four corners of the city\nwall with cross-shaped roofs, three\nlayers of double eaves, and multiple\nintersecting corners. The style is\nauthentic ancient architecture. I don't\nknow who designed it or if it was built\ninto the system. The farmland outside\nthe city walls has been expanded by a\nfull two times, stretching all the way\nto the riverbank. Even the river has\nbeen filled with fish traps and nets.\nCoupled with the lush orchard to the\neast, it seems that there is no need to\nworry about food sources. Overall, at\nfirst glance, King's Landing is quite\nwell constructed. Fong Yu as the\nbehind-the-scenes boss couldn't help but\ngive Seong Jaming, Lu Xiaoang, and Xiao\nYini, the core management team, a high\nscore in his mind. How about it? This\ncity is built pretty well, isn't it?\nFong Yu said to Chris beside him with\nsome pride. After all, he was also one\nof the founders of this city. To\neveryone's surprise, Chris shook his\nhead and said, \"Although it's quite\ngood, it's still far from being\ncomparable to St. Paul's territory, St.\nJohn.\" H. Fongu raised an eyebrow upon\nhearing this and asked, \"Is that St.\nJoe's Castle more magnificent than my\nKing's Landing?\" Chris nodded and said,\n\"St. Joe's castle is a castle that can\nhold 100,000 people. It's called a\ncastle, but it's actually a city built\non a mountain. Your King's Landing is\nabout the same size as the town at the\nfoot of the mountain. It's said that\nwhen St. Paul first entered the game, he\nappeared in the temple on the top of\nthat white city. Moreover, nearly 10,000\nnative humans originally lived in that\nSt. Joe's fort, and now those people\nhave become believers of the God of\nlight under the influence of St. Paul.\nDamn, that's going too far. Fongu cursed\ninwardly. We're all chosen ones,\nrepresentatives of God. So why did I\nonly inherit a dilapidated haunted house\nin the woods while that guy inherited a\ncity that can hold 100,000 people? This\nis so unfair. I'm so angry. So cold. I'm\nshivering. As if sensing Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s\nanger, the game assistant, Xiaolu,\noffered an explanation. They won nine\nout of 10 bets. Having a slight\nadvantage isn't unreasonable, is it?\nDamn, you call this a little bit? It's a\nwhole lot more. Don't tell me he also\nhas three companions in the city he\ninherited. Funu asked in his mind.\nThat's not called a partnership. It's a\nproper master servant relationship, but\nnot three, it's 12. After learning of\nthe enemy's strength, Fong Yu with a\nheavy heart walked towards the gates of\nKing&lt;unk&gt;s Landing with Chris. He was\ngoing to have a good discussion with\nSong Jamming about how to focus on\ndefending District 4. But when Fong Yu\nbrought Chris to the gates of King&lt;unk&gt;s\nLanding, they were suddenly stopped by\nfour guards wearing iron armor and\nwielding iron spears. Stop. The four\nguards held their spears to Fong Yu and\nChris and asked, \"Who are you? Where did\nyou come from?\" Fongu removed the\nheadscarf from his head and pointed to\nhis face. \"Do you recognize me?\" The\nfour guards looked at each other,\nseemingly not recognizing Fongu. When\nChris removed his headscarf, the four\nguards immediately tensed up with their\nblonde hair and blue eyes. They're\neither locals or players from other\nregions. \"Stop! Don't move. Who are you?\nIf you don't speak up, we're going to\ntake action.\" Seeing this, Fong Yu\nsighed helplessly and prepared to send a\nmessage to Song Jumming, asking him to\nsend a message to the guards. Just then,\na figure slowly emerged from the sun\nshade erected nearby, yawning and asking\nin a lazy voice, \"What's going on?\nWhat's all the noise about?\" Fongu\nturned his head and suddenly felt that\nthe person looked very familiar. After\nthinking about it carefully, he finally\nremembered the person's name. Yo, Long\nRit. The person who came out of the sun\nshade was Long Retian. When he heard\nsomeone calling his name, and the voice\nsounded familiar, he looked at the\nperson who called his name with his\nsleepy eyes. The next second, Long\nRetians eyes widened in shock, and he\nexclaimed, \"Holy crap, the great demon\nking.\" He clearly remembered Fong Yu\nchasing him with fireballs, \"Huh?\" Fongu\nraised an eyebrow and asked, \"What did\nyou just say?\" Long Retian realized he\nhad said the wrong thing and was so\nfrightened that he could barely walk.\nThe nickname Great Demon King originated\nin the chat channels of other servers in\nthe past 2 days. Rumors circulated that\na ruthless demon king was hiding in\nserver 6, possibly even a representative\nof the evil dark god, and the claims\nwere quite detailed. Upon seeing this\nnews, players in server 6 unconsciously\nbegan to associate this demon king with\nFongu. After all, Fong Yu was probably\nthe one who killed the most people in\nthe entire Sixth District. Of course,\npeople only dared to call him demon king\nbehind his back. To say it to Fong\nYu&lt;unk&gt;s face would be like an old man\nhanging himself, tired of living. So,\nLong Rit immediately put on a sheepish\nface and explained, \"Boss, please don't\nmisunderstand. I At this moment, one of\nthe guards blocking Fong Yu said to Long\nRien, \"Captain, this person not only\nrefuses to reveal his identity, but he's\nalso trying to bring someone who looks\nlike a player from another region into\nthe city. I suspect they're spies.\" Upon\nhearing this, Long Rit finally thought\nof a way to divert Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s\nattention. So, he turned around\naggressively and shouted at the guard,\n\"You don't even recognize the big boss,\nFong Yu. You must be blind.\" After\nsaying that, Long Riit immediately\nturned his head, bowed, and smiled\nobquiously at Fong Yu, saying, \"I'm\nsorry, boss. These kids didn't recognize\nyour greatness.\" And blocked your way. I\nwill definitely teach them a lesson\nlater. Fongu was about to say something\nwhen he heard the reprimanded guard\nangrily say to Long Rien, \"I did nothing\nwrong. The city lord's orders are that\nduring this critical period, all\nunidentified personnel are strictly\nprohibited from entering the city.\nBesides, that blonde guy next to me is\nclearly not a player from our region.\nWhat's wrong with me stopping them? Why\nare you reprimanding me? Upon hearing\nthis, Long Retians eyebrows shot up, his\nface twitched, and he gritted his teeth\nand yelled, \"You think you're so great?\"\nwhile raising his hand to slap the\nguard. Just then, Fongu grabbed Long\nRetians raised hand. Chapter 182. An\nunannounced army approaches. Long Rian\nwas slightly taken aback when he saw\nFong Yu grab his hand. He said, \"What's\nwrong, boss? I'm just teaching this\nignorant brat a lesson for you.\" Fong Yu\ngave Long Riiten a cold look. He did\nnothing wrong by faithfully guarding the\ncity gate. \"What gives you the right to\nlecture him?\" \"Just because you're some\nkind of captain.\" \"I didn't mean that,\"\nLong Retian thought, trying to explain\nto Fong You. But then the guard who had\nbeen reprimanded spoke up again. \"I've\nput up with you for too long. You make\nus wear heavy armor and stand in the sun\nwhile you sleep in the shade. Exactly.\nAnother guard pointed at Long Riiten and\nsaid, \"You're making us pay an entry fee\nto everyone entering the city, and you\nclaim it's a rule set by City Lord Song.\nWe've already asked City Lord Song, and\nthere's absolutely no such thing.\" Upon\nhearing this, Fong Yu looked at Long Rit\nand asked coldly, \"Is that so?\" Litin\nwas already drenched in sweat. He had\noffended Fong Yu before, and Fong Yu was\na ruthless character who would kill\nwithout hesitation. So when Fong\nYu&lt;unk&gt;s face turned cold, Long Rien was\nso frightened that he almost knelt down.\nHe stammered and tried to explain, his\nface contorted with grief. Big boss,\nplease let me explain. Stop. Fong Yu\nwaved his hand, interrupting Long Rit\nand said, It either exists or it\ndoesn't. I don't want to hear your\nnonsense. Does it exist or not? have\nvery good. Fongu sneered at Long Riin\nand said, \"As the captain of the guard,\nyou slacked off and slept during your\nduty, bullied your subordinates by\nabusing your position as a superior, and\nillegally collected unwarranted entry\nfees for personal gain. You should have\nwitnesses and physical evidence for\nthese three crimes, right?\" The young\nguard standing nearby said, \"We can be\nwitnesses. The physical evidence is in\nhis backpack.\" \"All right.\" Fong nodded,\nthen looked coldly at Long Rien and\nsaid, \"The city has a supervisory\ndepartment headed by Deputy City Lord\nXiao Yini, so I won't overstep my bounds\nand try him. Send someone to escort him\nto the supervisory department.\" Upon\nhearing this, Liiten looked up at Fong\nYu, wanting to say something more. But\nafter seeing Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s cold eyes, he\nswallowed hard and didn't dare to utter\nanother word. Following Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s\norder, two guards stepped forward,\ngrabbed Long Rien, disarmed him, and led\nhim into the city. At this moment, Fong\nYu looked at the guard who looked quite\nyoung, and smiled. I will inform Xiao\nYini about this matter. Long Ritians\nbehavior is indeed very bad. I will have\nher deal with it seriously. The specific\nhandling and punishment will be decided\naccording to the revised laws of\nKing&lt;unk&gt;s Landing. After hearing Fong\nYu&lt;unk&gt;s explanation, the young guard\nlooked at him with more respect and\nnodded, saying, \"I hope so.\" Fong Yu\nlooked at the young guard with interest\nand asked, \"What's your name and what's\nyour ID?\" \"Thank you, woman. ID 66,\" the\nyoung guard replied neither humbly nor\narrogantly. \"Judging from your\nappearance, you seem to be a post 2000's\ngeneration.\" Funu asked again. \"So, what\nif I am?\" Xiai Wuan looked at Fong Yu\nwith some suspicion, asking for his\nname, ID, and age. Was he trying to make\nthings difficult for him? He very good.\nFong Yu smiled slightly. I like young\npeople who dare to defy authority and do\nthe right thing. I will recommend you to\nLord Song to take over Long Retians\ncaptain position. I hope you can\ncontinue to maintain this. Upon hearing\nthis, Sia Wuan finally realized that\nFong Yu didn't intend to make things\ndifficult for him, but rather to promote\nhim. He breathed a slight sigh of\nrelief, stood at attention, saluted Fong\nYu, and said, \"Thank you, boss Fong Yu.\"\nHe Fong Yu smiled slightly and said,\n\"You did a great job. In these\nextraordinary times, guarding the city\ngates is indeed a very important duty.\nWe cannot slack off. Keep it up.\" The\nremaining four guards nodded\nemphatically upon hearing this. It was a\ngreat honor to receive the affirmation\nof Fong Yu, the strongest player among\nthem. with Fong Yu, the true leader of\nDistrict 6, whose status was even higher\nthan Lord Sanjmmings, vouching for him.\nThe four guards naturally wouldn't\nbother to investigate Chris's identity\nanymore. Although they were dutiful,\nthey weren't fools. So, Fong Yu led\nChris through the city gate and headed\ntowards the city lord's mansion, which\nwas also the Lord's residence. Upon\narriving at the city lord's mansion,\nFong Yu didn't bother to inform the\nguards of his identity. Instead, he\nnotified Song Jimming in advance to meet\nhim at the entrance. Then, led by Song\nJimming, Fong Yu and Chris arrived at a\nconference room. A short while later,\nSonata Sari was also called into the\nconference room by Sanjiming. As soon as\nshe saw Fong Yu, she showed a bright\nsmile. However, Fong Yu only returned a\ncalm and polite smile. After everyone\nhad arrived, Fong Yu gestured for\nSanjiing to close the conference room\ndoor. He then said to Song, \"Jiming,\nSonata, Sauri, and Chris, the three of\nyou should get to know each other. I\nthink you can all sense each other's\nidentities without me having to say\nanything.\" Fong Yu then raised his hand\nand pointed at Chris, saying, \"This is a\nplayer from District 4.\" Chris Odinsen.\nUpon hearing this, Song Jimming and\nSonata Sari glanced at the muscular man\nChris sitting opposite them. And then\nSong Jimming asked, \"You've become an\nundead, too?\" Chris nodded. So Song\nJimming laughed and said, \"Got it. Then\nwe're all on the same side.\" Then Song\nJimming reached out and shook hands with\nChris. And then Sonata Sari also shook\nhands with Chris and politely bowed\naccording to their etiquette saying,\n\"Please take care of me.\" Then Fong Yu\npointed to Song Jaming and Sonata Sari\nand said, \"This is Sanjiing, the lord of\ndistrict 6, and this is Sonata, the lord\nof district 7.\" After introducing\nthemselves, Fun Yu got straight to the\npoint, saying, \"Originally, I wanted to\nhelp Chris become the lord of District 4\nas soon as possible. But in reality,\nit's quite difficult, and I probably\ncan't do it for the time being.\" Huh?\nWhat? Song Jimming asked, puzzled. \"It\nshouldn't be a problem for you, Brother\nFong. Right? Just like dealing with Tojo\nMiroa, why not just use a decapitation\nstrike to take down that fourth district\nlord?\" Fong Yu shook his head and said,\n\"The Lord of District 4, St. Paul\nLuther, is not the same as that Tojo\nMiragea.\" According to reliable sources,\nhis overall strength is not only above\nmine, but even much stronger. Upon\nhearing this, Sanjuming and the others\nwidened their eyes in surprise. Is his\noverall strength much stronger than Fong\nYu? What does that even mean? It should\nbe noted that Fong Yu himself is not\nonly an intermediate level mage, but he\nalso has a swordsman level warrior\nservant and a mage level arch mage under\nhis command. These two servants alone\nare enough for him to roam freely\nthroughout District 6. But now a lord\nfrom district 4 with overall strength no\nless than Fong Yu has suddenly appeared.\nWait, boss, what's up with that Sao\nPaulo guy? How come he's even better\nthan you? Song Jimming was very puzzled.\nFong Yu was silent for a moment, then\nsaid in a deep voice, \"Actually, there\nis a secret hidden behind this survival\ngame.\" Fong Yu then revealed that he was\nthe spokesperson for the god of darkness\nand that St. Paul was the spokesperson\nfor the god of light. He also asked\nChris to tell him that St. Paul had a\nhuge city and 12 powerful servants.\nAfter listening, Song Jimming and Sonata\nSaari exchanged a shocked glance. They\nnever expected that there was such a\ncomplicated and torturous inside story\nwhich even involved the gods bet and the\nbattle for the spokesperson. After\nchecking the information, Sun Jimming\nsaid in confusion, \"Brother Fong, you\nsaid you killed St. Paul Luther's\nyounger brother last night, but I didn't\nsee him say anything in the world\nchannel. That doesn't seem reasonable,\ndoes it?\" Fongu frowned and said, \"This\nis also the situation that worries me\nthe most. If he had denounced me,\ncondemned me, or even insulted me on the\nworld channel last night or today, I\nwouldn't be too worried. Do you\nunderstand what I mean? Sanjuming was\nslightly takenback, then realized what\nhe meant and slammed his hand on the\ntable, saying, \"I know. Isn't it that\nsaying? A barking dog doesn't bite. Is\nthat what it means?\" Fongu nodded and\nsaid solemnly. Therefore, I have reason\nto believe that he has most likely\nalready launched a military operation\nagainst our district 6. That is why I am\nhere in person today. I need to\npersonally coordinate with you to deal\nwith any possible surprise attack from\ndistrict 4. At this point, Fongu looked\nat Song Jimming and said, \"All right,\nnow you can call Lu Xiao Fang, Xiao\nYini, and Lie Chun Long in.\" Just then\nthe conference room door was suddenly\npushed open from the outside and Lie\nChun Long rushed in looking flustered.\nHe said to Song Jimming, \"It's bad. The\ngarrison at the border of district 5\njust sent a message that a large number\nof enemy troops have crossed the border\nand entered our district 6. Quickly\nnotify brother Fong. Ask him what to do.\nNo need to notify them.\" A voice reached\nLee Chunlong&lt;unk&gt;s ears, and he\nimmediately glared, wanting to turn\naround and question the speaker about\nwhy they hadn't notified him. But boss,\nwhat are you doing here? Lie was stunned\nwhen he saw Fong Yu. Fong Yu sighed\nhelplessly and said, \"Sigh. I'm too lazy\nto talk to you anymore. All right, stop\nwasting your breath. What's the specific\nsituation with the border guards? You\nonly said that enemy troops crossed the\nborder, but how many people did you\nmention? Lieong was slightly taken\naback. He immediately opened the chat\nchannel and began to inquire about the\nborder guards. The news he received was\nthat the border guards were everywhere,\ncountless, and the number might be over\n30,000. Impossible. There aren't that\nmany people in all five districts\ncombined. Did all the players from all\neight districts come? That doesn't make\nsense, Sun. Jimming said, puzzled.\nSeeing this situation, Fong Yu could\nonly helplessly say to Sanjiing, \"Never\nmind whether it's true or false for now.\nImmediately notify everyone to return to\nthe city and mobilize all armed\npersonnel to enter a state of combat\nreadiness. Then follow my orders in\neverything you do understand.\" Song\nJiming nodded and began to operate the\nchat interface. Then Funu said, \"I\nsuspect their primary target this time\nis not King's Landing, but my manor, so\nI need to go back immediately. You guys\nstay here and organize everyone to\nassemble and arm yourselves as soon as\npossible. Keep in touch with us in real\ntime for updates.\" Immediately, Fong Yu\nrushed out of the conference room, took\nout his magic wand, released the dance\nof the wind, and flew into the air at\nhigh speed towards the manor. Chapter\n183. The villain dies from talking too\nmuch. After Fong Yu rushed back to the\nmanor, he immediately went into the\nhouse and found Olivia asking anxiously,\n\"What will you do if the haunted house\nis destroyed?\" Olivia was stunned by\nwhat she heard. She didn't understand\nwhy Fongu would suddenly rush into the\nhouse and ask her such a question. \"What\nhappened, master?\" Olivia frowned. \"Why\ndo you ask that?\" Fong Yu said urgently.\nAn enemy force of over 30,000 men is\nabout to arrive. I just want to ask if\nthe haunted house is destroyed. Will you\nbe all right? Upon hearing this,\nOlivia's expression changed slightly.\nAnd she replied, \"Alpha and I will be\nfine if the haunted house is destroyed\nbecause our physical bodies are now\ncomplete and we can leave the haunted\nhouse, but Valentina is not yet. and the\nthree undead you resurrected from the\ngraveyard might also be affected. Upon\nhearing this, Fongu took a deep breath\nand nodded, saying, \"Understood. Then\nhurry up and go to the spider cave to\nmobilize the zombie army.\" Olivia nodded\nand quickly left. Then Fong Yu turned to\nAlpha beside him and said, \"Alpha, go to\nthe dragon's lair in the south and tell\nOdum that if he still wants to hear the\nrest of Le Yunong's story and wants to\ncontinue eating delicious barbecue,\nhe'll have to help him out.\" Alpha\nnodded, turned, and darted out of the\ncabin, speeding southward. After Olivia\nand Alpha left, Fongu recalculated his\nside strength. King's Landing should be\nable to gather around 3,000 armed\npersonnel. The undead army currently has\nover 1,800 people. Even if we multiply\nthat by four, the total combat strength\nwould only be 7,200.\nIncluding the armed personnel in King's\nLanding, the total combat strength would\nbarely reach a little over 10,000, which\nis still a huge disadvantage compared to\nthe enemy's more than 30,000 people. As\nfor the dragon Odum, Fongu didn't know\nif it would help him, but reason told\nhim that Odum was unlikely to intervene.\nHe asked Alpha to inquire, but that was\njust a sliver of hope. So, if we\ncalculate it carefully, the current\ncombat strength comparison is 10,000 to\n30,000, which is an absolute\ndisadvantage in terms of numbers.\nHowever, if it's a defensive operation\nrelying on King's Landing, then a 1v3\nsituation is still possible. But the\nproblem now is that Funu can't give up\nthis haunted house for Valentina's sake.\nTherefore, he had no choice but to\ndefend this manor as his base. The\nproblem is that his manner is\npractically indefensible at present.\nApart from the hundreds of magic vines\nunderground, he has no other defensive\ncapabilities. So, what should we do?\nJust as Fong Yu was scratching his head,\na sound of wood breaking came from\noutside. Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s heart sank\nslightly. He stepped out of the wooden\nhouse and immediately saw a giant black\nleopard appear in the manor. On the\nleopard sat a tall, thin, red-haired\nwhite man wearing leather armor. He\nglanced at Fong Yu contemptuously and\nasked, looking down at him, \"You are\nFongu.\" Fongu glanced in the direction\nthe red-haired man had come from and\ndidn't see anyone else, meaning that the\nman had come alone. Fong Yu then looked\nup and asked, \"Player native?\" The\nred-haired man sneered. You actually\nthink I'm one of those stupid natives?\nYou deserve to die. With that, the\nred-haired man drew two slender daggers\nfrom his waist and said to Fong Yu with\na cold smile. Killing you will earn me\nover 4,000 honor points, which is quite\na substantial reward. \"Who exactly are\nyou?\" Fongu asked again. Although he was\nasking a question, his eyes kept\nscanning the red-haired man and the\nblack panther he was riding. And he\ndirectly used the skill eye of weakness\non the black panther. The eye of\nweakness has been activated. The black\npanther's weakness is its soft belly. At\nthis moment, after hearing Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s\nquestion, the red-haired man smiled\ncontemptuously again and said, \"Before\nyou die, I don't mind letting you know\nmy name. Listen carefully. My name is\nI'll listen to you, you motherfucker.\"\nBefore the man in red could finish\nspeaking, Fongu had already drawn his\nblack gold ancient blade and launched a\nsavage charge attack directly at the\nred-haired man on the black panther. The\nred-haired man had only spoken halfway\nwhen he saw Fongu charging towards him\nwith a black knife. Startled and\nenraged, he suddenly squeezed the black\npanther beneath him with his legs. The\npanther understood and with a slight\nflick of its limbs, pulled the\nred-haired man on its back to the side.\nHowever, what the red-haired man didn't\nknow was that the savage charge skill\ndirectly locks onto the target. As long\nas the target doesn't disappear from\nsight or go beyond the casting range,\nsavage charge won't be interrupted. So\nFong Yu slightly turned his body and\ncontinued charging towards the\nred-haired man on the Black Panther. At\nthis moment, the red-haired man also\nrealized what was happening. He was\nenraged by Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s behavior of not\neven letting him finish his opening\nremarks and once again commanded the\nBlack Panther beneath him, \"Kill him.\"\nSo, the nearly 5 m long black panther\nimmediately raised its two huge front\npaws, its sharp claws springing out from\nits paw pads, and scratched at Fong Yu,\nwho was coming towards it. This was the\nmoment Fong Yu had been waiting for.\n\"Demon vine!\" Funu roared. In an\ninstant, two thick purplish black\ntentacles shot out of the ground and\nbound the black panthers two hind legs.\nAt the same time, a sharp stone thorn\npierced the ground and plunged into the\nbelly of the black panther, whose two\nhind legs were bound. Its two front paws\nwere off the ground, and whose attention\nwas entirely focused on Fong Yu, and who\nhad no time to dodge. A woo! The black\npanther let out a miserable howl, and\nits two front paws that were scratching\nat Fong Yu curled back due to the pain.\nFong Yu collided with the red-haired man\namidst his surprised and suspicious\ngaze. The stun effect of the savage\ncharge immediately took effect and the\nred-haired man was briefly stunned.\nAlthough it only lasted for 1 second,\nthat 1 second was enough for Fong Yu to\nslice off the guy's head with one\nstrike. After dealing with the\nred-haired man, Fong Yu, standing on the\nBlack Panther's back, twisted his blade\nand plunged it into the back of the\npanther's neck, killing the panther that\nhad been lifted off the ground by the\nspikes. Combat time: 8 seconds. Savage\ncharge process 5 seconds during which\nFong Yu completed the incantation of the\nground spike technique, activated the\nground spike technique one second while\njumping, severed the red-haired man's\nhead 1 second, and killed the black\npanther one second. There was not a\nsingle unnecessary movement, nor wasted\na single moment. That's it. TCH Fong Yu\njumped off the Black Panther's corpse\nand spat on the red-haired head rolling\non the ground. Remember this in your\nnext life. If you're going to fight,\nthen fight. Don't start by spouting\nnonsense. Chapter 184. The army presses\nin. Actually, rather than saying that\nthis red-haired guy died because he\ntalked too much, it's more accurate to\nsay that he died because he\nunderestimated Fongu. Judging from the\ntwo poison daggers in his hand, this guy\nis probably an assassin. His mount is a\nblack panther known for its agility. If\nhe hadn't barged into his manner, but\ninstead sneaked in to assassinate Fong\nYu, the outcome would have been very\ndifferent. However, just as Fong Yu was\nreviewing the battle, a sudden scream\ncaught his attention. He turned his head\nto look in the direction of the scream\nand felt a gust of wind brush past his\near. Buzz. An arrow was embedded in the\nwall of the wooden house behind Fong Yu.\nIn an instant, Fong Yu turned his head\nand saw the feathered arrow on the wall\nand broke out in a cold sweat. He\nimmediately turned his head again to\nlook in the direction from which the\narrow had come and saw that on the roof\nof the monster house, there was an\narcher holding a bow and arrow and\naiming at him. Seeing this, Fa was about\nto take out a shield from his storage\nring to protect himself when he saw the\narcher on the roof of the monster house\nsuddenly hit by a pink spiderweb. The\nsticky web instantly glued the archer's\nhands to the bow and arrow, making it\nimpossible for him to fire any more\narrows. It seems that Sakura, who was\nhiding in the monster hut, launched a\nsneak attack on the archers. Just then,\na small figure slowly rose from the roof\nof the monster house. It was the puppet\nthat the book of evil gods had spat out.\nThe puppet brandished its blood dripping\nscissors, silently approaching the\narcher, who was trying to tear the\nspiderw webs from his hands, and then\nstabbed him in the kidneys. Uh uh uh.\nThe puppet's attack speed was extremely\nfast. In the blink of an eye, it stabbed\nthe archer three times in the lower\nback, then let out a strange childish\nlaugh before leaping up and slicing open\nthe archer's corateed artery with the\nsharp blades of its scissors. After the\narcher fell from the monster's roof with\nan incredulous look on his face,\nclutching his neck, the puppet turned to\nFong Yu with a strange smile and\ndisappeared into the monster's hut. It's\nthat little guy. Fongu was slightly\ntakenback. He had almost forgotten about\nthe puppet after putting it in the\nmonster house. He didn't expect that at\nthis crucial moment, Sakura and the\npuppet would come out to help. Just as\nFong Yu was about to go and check if the\narcher who had fallen to the ground was\ndead, a series of noisy voices and the\nsound of horses hooves came from the\nwoods to the northwest. It seems the\nenemy's vanguard has arrived. The\nassassin riding the black panther and\nthe archer were probably trying to steal\nkills and gain a lot of honor points, so\nthey broke away from the vanguard and\ncame alone only to end up being killed.\nAfter a moment of contemplation, Fong Yu\nimmediately dawned an invisibility cloak\nand entered stealth mode. He then took\nout magic gloves, put them on, and took\nout an all-elemental staff to summon\nwindb blades. When facing a large number\nof enemies, the wind blade is the best\ncombat magic capable of unexpectedly\nkilling them. As Fongu summoned three\nwindb blades, several white scouts\ndressed in leather armor and riding\nhorses rushed out from the woods to the\nnorthwest. When they saw the manor in\nfront of them, one of them said to the\nperson next to him, \"Captain Roarshock,\nwe can report to the lord now. The\nlocation is correct.\" The scout captain\nnamed Roshock nodded and was about to\nopen the chat channel when he suddenly\nsensed a strong threat of death. At the\ncritical moment, Roershock instinctively\nleaned back and lay on the horse. He\nthen felt a gust of wind whistling past\nhis body, followed by a stream of hot\nliquid splashing onto him. Roarshock\nglanced at the scalding blood splattered\non him, then at the headless corpse of\nhis companion beside him. Horror\ninstantly gripped his mind, so he\nimmediately kicked off the stirrups,\ndismounted, and hid behind the horse,\ndrawing his long sword at the same time.\n\"Shneer lockins, are you all right?\"\nRoorshock called out to his teammates on\nthe other side, but no one responded.\nSo, he carefully walked around the horse\nand looked at his teammates, but all he\nsaw were several headless corpses.\nslowly sliding off the horse. In a\nsingle encounter, without even knowing\nwho the enemy was or where they were,\nthis scout squad was almost completely\nwiped out. \"Holy shit!\" Lua cursed under\nhis breath, his hands gripping the long\nsword, beginning to tremble. He took a\nfew deep breaths to calm his fear, and\nthen an option flashed through his mind.\nRun away or find the enemy. He only\nneeded 0.1 seconds to think about the\nproblem before he had an answer. And\nthen he looked back at the woods he had\ncome from. He dared not ride the horse\nanymore because the unseen and eerie\nattack had already killed several of his\nteammates. So Luosa decided to escape\ndirectly into the woods. Just as\nRoarshock was about to rush into the\nwoods, an arrow pierced his calf. Ah.\nLua cried out in pain and fell to the\nground. Fongu walked up to the scout he\nhad shot in the calf and said calmly,\n\"Answer my question or die now. You\nchoose. Finally seeing the enemy who\nkilled his teammate appear, Lu Sa\ngritted his teeth and endured the pain\nin his leg, asking, \"Are you Fong Yu?\"\nAbsolutely genuine. Fong Yu nodded.\nWithout saying a word, Lua raised his\nwrist towards Fong Yu, and a black\nshadow instantly flew out from Lu\nSa&lt;unk&gt;s sleeve, shooting towards Fong\nYu&lt;unk&gt;s face. However, Fong Yu, whose\nagility had already exceeded 10 points,\nnaturally had a reaction ability that\nsurpassed the limits of ordinary people.\nHe quickly tilted his head and dodged\nthe fatal blow. But then, Lua raised his\nother hand and another black shadow shot\ntowards Fongu. Fongu frowned slightly,\nraised his hand to grab the dart shot\ntowards his chest, and said helplessly,\n\"I gave you a chance.\" The next second,\nFong Yu flicked his wrist and plunged\nthe hidden arrow into the heart of the\nlast scout. The advanced scouts and\nscouts have already arrived, indicating\nthat the main enemy force is not far\naway. After a moment's thought, Fong Yu\ndragged the corpse to the edge of the\ncemetery and stuffed it into an empty\ncoffin. He needed to use the scouts\nmouth to find out the enemy's exact\nnumber of people, troop deployment, and\nother information. Since he is unwilling\nto speak while alive, we can only make\nhim speak after he dies. However,\nsomething surprising happened to Fong\nYu. When the green light from the statue\nof the goddess of death and life shone\ninto the coffin where Lu Sia was, the\ncorpse actually began to burn.\nImmediately, a white beam of light\nappeared in the sky, pulling the elucory\nsoul within the corpse into the high\nsky. Fu frowned upon seeing this. What's\ngoing on? The deceased had become a\nbeliever in the god of light and the\ngoddess of life and death could not\nresurrect the body. I see. Fongu\nsuddenly realized that the corpses of\nthose who worship the god of light could\nnot be resurrected as undead. Their\nsouls are summoned to the heavens after\ndeath and they cannot be resurrected as\nundead with souls but their corpses can\nbe resurrected as zombies. Therefore,\nFong Yu had no choice but to give up the\nidea of reviving the corpse. At that\nmoment, sounds came from both the woods\nto the west and the woods to the east.\nFongu frowned and turned to look. A\nlarge number of armored warriors\nappeared at the western edge of the\nforest. While at the eastern edge of the\nforest emerged a group of 3 m tall dwarf\ndemon zombies from the crypt, the enemy\nand reinforcements arrived at the same\ntime. Without any declarations or\ndialogue, a loud shout came from the\nenemy forces in the west. Attack!\nImmediately, all the armored warriors\ndrew their long swords and charged into\nthe manor. Meanwhile, the army of crypt\nzombies in the eastern woods under\nOlivia's command, charged toward the\nenemy forces in the west. The real\nbattle has begun. Chapter 185. Forced\nevacuation. The moment the two armies\nlaunched their charge, Fong Yu used the\ndance of the wind to fly to the roof of\nthe wooden house and began chanting the\nfire dragon spell, preparing to use it\nto sweep away the hundreds of armored\nwarriors who had stormed into the manor.\nOn the battlefield, a mage who can use\narea of effect damage magic is every\nwarrior's nightmare. But as his fire\ndragon spell lit up and charged towards\nthe group of armored warriors, a dozen\nfireballs and two fire dragons\nsimultaneously appeared at the edge of\nthe western forest. There were even\nthree water elemental minions. Damn it,\nFong Yu cursed inwardly. Judging from\nthe number of fireballs and fire\ndragons, there were at least 10\nlow-level mages and five mid-level mages\non the other side. As Fong Yu's fire\ndragon charged into the enemy crowd, the\nenemy's dozen or so fireballs and two\nfire dragons also rushed into the zombie\narmy. Fortunately, under Olivia's\ncommand, the pigheaded zombies standing\nin the first row immediately raised\ntheir giant shields to block most of the\nfireballs and the two fire dragons,\nminimizing the damage from this wave of\nmagical attacks. Even so, nearly 10\npigheaded zombies fell in the flames in\none round. Meanwhile, the three water\nelemental minions launched streams of\nwater at Fong Yu's fire dragon. And\nsoon, Fong Yu's fire dragon was\nextinguished by the continuous water\nattacks from the water elemental\nminions. At the same time, the two\narmies finally clashed in the center of\nthe manor. A fierce battle ensued. While\ndodging the fireballs hurtling towards\nhim from midair with his agile\nmovements, Fong Yu pondered how to deal\nwith the current situation. Just then,\nmore than a dozen sharp arrows shot\ntowards Fongu, three of which were\nshimmering with magical light. Fongu\nknew that the enemy had locked onto his\nposition, so he had no choice but to\nimmediately take out his shield to\ndefend himself. But when the arrows were\nabout to hit him, a faint white light\nshield appeared around him, blocking all\nof the dozen or so arrows. The arch's\nguardian stone has blocked 10 ordinary\narrows for you, consuming 10 mana\npoints. The archm's guardian stone\nblocked three fire arrows for you,\nconsuming nine mana points. Upon seeing\nthe game assistance notification, Fong\nYu instantly realized that he was\nequipped with a legendary defensive\ntreasure. What was there to be afraid\nof? So, he immediately withdrew his\nshield and began searching for the dozen\nor so mages behind the enemy lines and\nstarted summoning wind blades. I have\nthe guardian stone protecting me, so\nlet's have a magical duel. After\nconfirming the location of an enemy\nmage, Fongu did not hesitate to command\nthe wind blades to attack. Under the\nsudden attack of the invisible windb\nblades, the mage who was summoning\nfireballs to attack the zombies was\nquickly beheaded. Then the wind blades\nchanged direction and began to fly\ntowards another mage. After Fong Yu\nkilled three low-level mages, the enemy\nseemed to realize what was happening and\nbegan to send a large number of\nshieldbearing guards to protect the\nmages. At the same time, the mages\nstopped bombarding the zombie army with\nmagic and began to summon defensive\nspells such as fire shields, water\ncurtains, and earth walls. In the end,\nFong Yu's two wind blades were exhausted\nafter forcibly breaking through the\nwater curtain of a mid-level water mage\nand killing him. The opposing mage then\nbegan to focus fire on Fong Yu on the\nroof with several fireballs and water\narrows shooting towards him. Protected\nby the guardian stone, Fongu naturally\ndidn't need to cast any defensive magic.\nHe simply relied on the guardian stone's\nlight shield to withstand the fireballs\nand water arrows. With the help of the\ngame assistant, he discovered that\nblocking each fireball or water arrow\nwould consume five magic points, but the\nopponent would consume 20 magic points\neach time they cast a fireball or water\narrow. The ratio was 1:4, so he was\nactually making a profit. However, since\nthe opponent still had 11 mages, the 111\nnumerical advantage still caused his\nmagic power to drop rapidly. With no\nother choice, Fongu had to temporarily\ngive up using magic and directly took\nout two magic crystals to start\nabsorbing magic power. With the\nreplenishment of magic crystals, the\nrate of magic power consumption slowed\ndown a lot. But soon, the game assistant\nissued a new notification. Your house is\nunder attack. Current durability is\n997/1000.\nYour house is under attack. Current\ndurability is 992/1000.\nUpon seeing this message, Funu realized\nthat some fireballs deflected by his\nlight shield had landed on the roof and\nwere beginning to scorch the wooden roof\nbeneath his feet. To prevent the wooden\nhouse from burning down, Fong Yu had no\nchoice but to manipulate the guardian\nstone to expand the range of the light\nshield, covering the wooden house\nbeneath his feet. However, as a result,\na large number of stray arrows and enemy\nsoldiers near the wooden house began to\nshift their attacks to the light shield.\nIn an instant, Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s magic power\nbegan to decline rapidly again. At this\nrate, it would be difficult for him to\nlast more than 2 minutes. The good news\nis that Fong Yu drew most of the enemy\nmages and archers fire, greatly\nrelieving pressure on the zombie army.\nRelying on the size advantage of the\npigheaded men and the dwarfs of the\ncave, coupled with their invulnerability\nto swords and blades, and the combined\nstrangulation of hundreds of demonic\nvine tentacles underground, they quickly\ngained the upper hand in the battle.\nUnder Olivia's command and control, the\nzombie army relentlessly reaped the\nlives of enemy soldiers. Judging from\nthis momentum, the zombie army should be\nable to annihilate all the enemy forces\nin the manor in less than 2 minutes and\nthen launch a counterattack. The current\nsituation also caught the attention of\nthe local commander. Under the command\nof the enemy commander, the dozen or so\nmages who had been focusing their fire\non Fong Yu finally changed their targets\nand launched another magical bombardment\nof the zombie troops. Fong Yu really\nwanted to taunt the opposing magician\nformation again. But unfortunately, his\nmagic power was almost depleted, and he\ncould only barely maintain the light\nshield of the guardian stone to protect\nthe wooden house. Left with no other\nchoice, he took out his horn bow and\nbegan firing at the enemy troops on the\nground, hoping to speed up the zombies\nadvance. Not only was the battlefield in\nthe manor, but large numbers of zombies\nwere also attacking the enemy forces to\nthe west from the woods to the south and\nnorth. Magical flames scorched the\nzombies flesh. Their furious roars shook\nthe trees and armored soldiers were\nreduced to mincemeat by the dwarf\nzombies massive clubs. Their corpses\nbeing rapidly devoured by tentacles\nemerging from the earth. Judging from\nthe situation, it seems that things are\ngradually improving. But Fongu knew that\nthis was only temporary because the\nenemy's main force had not yet arrived.\nOnce all 30,000 enemy troops arrived and\nsurrounded them, his own 1,000 plus\nzombies would ultimately find it\ndifficult to withstand them. At this\nmoment, Fong Yu also received a message\nfrom Song Jiming that a large number of\nenemy troops, no less than 20,000, had\nalso appeared outside King&lt;unk&gt;s\nLanding. Upon seeing this news, Fong Yu\nbreathed a sigh of relief. If the enemy\nhad deployed 20,000 troops to deal with\nKing's Landing, then the pressure on him\nto deal with 10,000 enemy troops would\nbe much less. Just then, an incredibly\nblinding white light suddenly shone from\nthe edge of the woods to the west,\nforcing Fong Yu to close his eyes. When\nhe opened his eyes again, he gasped in\nshock because the bodies of a large\nnumber of zombies in the manor began to\nemit white smoke and soon began to\nspontaneously combust. The demonic vines\nthat were wreaking havoc on the ground\nimmediately retreated underground, no\nlonger daring to show themselves, Fongu\nlooked towards the edge of the woods to\nthe west and saw a blonde man with a\nface that looked 70% like Charles\nlooking at him with a half smile, while\nthe white crystal wand in his hand was\ncontinuously emitting bursts of white\nlight. Beside him stood 12 men and women\nwith golden eyes, dressed in white\nrobes, and with different expressions.\nWithout a doubt, the blonde man holding\nthe white crystal wand must be St. Paul\nLuther, and the 12 goldeneyed men and\nwomen beside him must be his servants.\nIt's the purifying light, a highle light\ntype magic. Olivia rushed to Fong\nYu&lt;unk&gt;s side to explain, her body also\nemitting wisps of white smoke, but\nthankfully she didn't spontaneously\ncombust. She said urgently again, \"This\nkind of advanced light magic is\ndevastating to low-level zombies.\nMaster, we can't hold them off. Let's\nretreat immediately. With that, Olivia\nwaved her hand, directing the zombies,\nwhich had begun to spontaneously combust\nto charge towards the enemy forces to\nthe west. I can only let the walkers\nself-destruct to buy them one last bit\nof time. After saying that, the zombies\nthat rushed toward the western edge of\nthe woods began to explode one after\nanother. In an instant, a large amount\nof flesh and blood covered with undying\nenergy was sprayed onto the enemy army.\nThe enemies who were contaminated by the\nundying energy fell to the ground and\nhowled. If they were not treated\nquickly, they would soon be corroded to\ndeath by the undying energy. Damn it,\nthose wretched undead zombies. Seeing\nthis, St. Paul had no choice but to\nshift his attention away from Fong Yu\nand together with his servants, cast\ndefensive and healing spells to resist\nthe zombies self-destruction and to heal\nthe soldiers contaminated by the undead\nenergy. Hurry up and let's go, Master\nOlivia urged anxiously again. What about\nValentina? Fong Yu said anxiously. I\nhave to guard the haunted house. At that\nmoment, Valentina's voice echoed in Fong\nYu&lt;unk&gt;s mind. Master, I can hide inside\nthe magic crystal. You just need to take\nthe crystal with you. Fong Yu was\noverjoyed upon hearing this and said to\nOlivia, \"Go and pick up Sakura and the\npuppet.\" After saying that, he\nimmediately jumped off the roof and\nrushed into the wooden house to\nValentina's room. After picking up the\nmagic crystal, he also collected the\nbook of evil god, the magic\nrefrigerator, and all the valuable\nsupplies he could carry in the cellar.\nFinally, he gritted his teeth and rushed\nout of the wooden house to meet up with\nOlivia, who had already connected with\nSakura and the magic puppet. Together,\nthey fled towards the woods to the east.\nAt this moment, all of the more than\n1,000 zombies had finally\nself-destructed. St. Paul then released\na wide range holy light healing spell to\nclear the undead energy from all the\nsoldiers. However, when he looked back\nat the manor, he found that Fong\nYu&lt;unk&gt;s figure had disappeared. trying\nto run. Sao Paulo sneered. You think you\ncan escape? Everyone, chase after them.\nSo, under Sao Paulo&lt;unk&gt;s command, the\narmy once again charged toward the woods\nto the east. Before leaving, St. Paul\nmade sure to have the fire mages set\nFong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s haunted house on fire.\nLooking at the haunted house engulfed in\nflames, St. Paul smiled slightly and\nsaid, \"This is the spokesperson for the\ngod of darkness. Nothing special.\nChapter 186. stupid thing. Fongu was in\na bad mood as he hurried through the\nwoods. This was the biggest loss he had\nsuffered since entering the game. They\nlost so much money that they had to\nabandon their base. Fortunately, no\nimportant supplies or people were lost.\nNow, his only worry is Alpha and the\ncemetery. Alpha should be fine. Even if\nit returns, knowing it's still alive, it\nshouldn't engage in a direct\nconfrontation with the enemy. As for\nthat cemetery, I wonder if it will be\ndestroyed. If it is, then Song Juming,\nSonata Sari, and Chris might have to\nturn back into corpses. However, during\nhis escape, Fongu received no news of\nSong Jumming or Sonata Sari's deaths. It\nseemed the enemy hadn't targeted the\ngrave, but the haunted house was likely\nbeyond saving. Fortunately, the problem\nwasn't too serious. It was just a loss\nof some repair supplies. As long as he\ndidn't die, he could rebuild the haunted\nhouse. The most important question right\nnow is how to deal with Sao Paulo and\nthat huge enemy force. Now that his\nzombie army has been completely wiped\nout, the only thing he can rely on is\nKing's Landing. Therefore, he must get\nto King's Landing as soon as possible\nand take advantage of the town's terrain\nto launch a counterattack. Considering\nthat King's Landing was already\nsurrounded by 20,000 troops, Fong Yu\nused Wind Dance to lift himself and\nOlivia into the sky after they broke out\nof the eastern woods and flew towards\nKing's Landing. Shortly after they took\noff, preparing to leap across the 10 m\nwide river, enemy troops appeared on the\nopposite bank to intercept them. These\ntroops immediately spotted Fong Yu and\nhis companion in midair, and archers and\nmages began firing at them. Fortunately,\nFong Yu had enough magic to maintain the\nprotective shield of the Guardian Stone,\nsuccessfully blocking the attacks. He\nflew over the enemy army and arrived at\ntop the walls of King&lt;unk&gt;s Landing.\nFortunately, Fongu had spoken to Lie\nChunlong, who was stationed in the city\nbefore taking off. So, the archers\nguarding the city wall did not attack\nFong Yu and his companion. As soon as\nFong Yu and Olivia landed, Lie Chunlong\nrushed over and asked with concern,\n\"Boss, are you all right?\" Fong Yu shook\nhis head and asked, \"How's the situation\nhere?\" Li Chunlong glanced at the\nenemy's formation outside the city wall\nand said, \"They're fine for now. They\nhaven't attacked the city since they\nappeared. I don't know what's going on.\"\nFunu sighed and said, \"Alas, that's\nbecause they were attacking my manor\njust now. They probably wanted to kill\nme first and then force you to\nsurrender. \"Now that I've escaped. Once\nthe enemy troops besieging the manor\narrive, that's probably when they'll\nattack the city.\" \"So, what do we do\nnow?\" Liin Long asked. Funu pointed to\nOlivia beside him and said, \"Now you\nlisten to her arrangements, how to\nallocate the garrison resources, and how\nto fight. Listen to her. No problem.\" Li\nChin Long immediately shook his head and\nsaid, \"That's definitely no problem. I\nwas just wondering how to arrange it.\"\nFong Yu then turned to Olivia and said,\n\"Then you can start setting things up\nnow. I'll go and settle Valentina and\nher belongings.\" Olivia nodded and then\nbegan to inquire about the troop\ndeployment in Li Chunlong City while\nFong Yu once again used the dance of\nwind and used the windwave to carry the\nbook of evil god and the artifact\nrefrigerator towards the city lord's\nmansion. Upon arriving at the city\nlord's mansion, Fong Yu asked Song\nJuming, who was already waiting there,\nto arrange a room for him and put all\nhis belongings in. Then he and Song\nJiming went to the conference room where\nall the senior managers of district 7\nexcept for Lie Chun Long were already\nwaiting. Fong Yu walked directly to the\nhead seat and said with a serious\nexpression, \"I think everyone knows the\ncurrent situation. It's very critical. I\nhope everyone can unite and overcome\nthis difficulty together.\" Everyone\nnodded in agreement. Fong Yu then\ninitiated this emergency meeting. The\nmeeting was brief, mainly confirming the\ncity's supply lines and the number of\ncombat ready personnel. Through the\nreport, Fongu learned that the city's\nfood supplies could sustain the entire\npopulation for 3 days. But if\nunnecessary resources were traded for\nfood at the exchange, it could last for\n6 days. The number of combat ready\npersonnel was approximately 6,800.\n6 days is enough, Fu said. The rest is\nabout how to repel and eliminate these\ninvaders. With 6,800 men defending the\ncity and the enemy numbering around\n30,000, it shouldn't be a big problem.\nYou all continue to hold your posts and\nmake sure nothing goes wrong in the\ncity. Also, we need to ensure the supply\nof combat materials. After the meeting,\nFongu returned to the southern city\nwall. At this time, the army formation\noutside the city had expanded again, and\nit seemed that the enemy that was\nbesieging Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s manor had also\narrived. Looking at the dark mass of\nenemy troops outside the city, Fongu\nfelt a little heavy-hearted. He truly\nrealized that in the face of such a\nlarge-scale war, the strength of an\nindividual is ultimately limited.\nFortunately, he had Olivia, an\nexperienced battlefield commander, on\nhis side. Under her command, the guards\non the city wall were optimally\nallocated. There were even many\nlow-grade materials such as rubble and\nwooden stakes along the city wall to be\nused for counterattacks when the enemy\nattacked the city. It can be said that\nalmost everything that could be used was\nused. After Fong Yu arrived, Li Chunlong\nsaid to him with a somewhat grim\nexpression, \"Boss, the people on the\nother side have called out to you,\nasking you to respond.\" Fong Yu nodded.\nThis was a part he had already\nanticipated. So Fongu went to the city\nwall, looked down at the city below, and\nsaid loudly, \"Speak your mind.\" A moment\nlater, a figure emerged from the enemy\nranks. Judging from the white crystal\nwand in his hand and his blonde hair, it\nwas none other than St. Paul Luther.\nThis fellow had boldly walked directly\ninto the archer's range, reaching the\nfoot of the city wall, seemingly\nunconcerned that the archers on the wall\ncould harm him. He probably possessed a\ndefensive artifact similar to a grand\nmage's guardian stone. Mr. Fong Yu,\nhello. St. Paul looked up at Fong Yu on\nthe city wall and smiled. I think you\nshould know the purpose of my leading\nthis army here this time. Is it to\navenge your own brother? Fongu said\ncoldly. However, St. Paul shook his head\nand smiled. No, no, no. Quite the\nopposite. I am very grateful to you for\nkilling my foolish brother for me. You\nmay not know, but although he was my own\nbrother, he committed all sorts of evil\ndeeds and even degenerated into a\nvampire, completely abandoning the\nembrace of the god of light. So death\nwas his destined end. Upon hearing this,\nFongu frowned and asked, \"Then what is\nthe purpose of you bringing so many\ntroops here?\" St. Paul smiled again and\nsaid, \"It's very simple. As the\nspokesperson of the god of light, I\nnaturally want to eliminate all evil in\nthis world. And you are the most evil\nperson among all the players right now.\nThat bloodthirsty, ruthless demon king.\nSo please let me purify the darkness\nwithin you and restore light to this\nworld. After a moment of silence, Fongu\ncursed at St. Paul below the city walls.\nYou idiot. Chapter 187. Breaking the\nopen scheme. Relieving the siege of Wei\nby relieving the siege of Xiao. Faced\nwith the deafening cries of condemnation\noutside the city, Fong Yu narrowed his\neyes slightly. At this moment, not only\nwere the sounds of rebellion deafening\noutside the city, but even the World\nChannel was flooded with uniform\nsubtitles listing Fong Yu's crimes. The\ncharges include maliciously disrupting\nthe harmonious atmosphere of the 10\nmajor regions, maliciously invading\nregion 7 and killing a large number of\nplayers and lords in region 7,\nmaliciously invading region 5 and\nkilling player troops from regions\nthree, four, and five who were\nconducting joint military exercises and\nresurrecting the corpses of the dead to\nbecome zombies for them to drive, etc.\nSure enough, after this series of moves,\nFong Yu noticed that the guards on the\ncity wall began to frequently turn their\nheads to look at him, and their eyes\nbegan to show suspicion. After all, as\nthe old saying goes, many voices can\nmelt metal, and accumulated slander can\ndestroy bones. Under the wave of public\nopinion created by Sao Paulo, players in\nzone 6 began to have doubts. Fongu knew\nthat St. Paul was using a preemptive\ntactic of taking the moral high ground\nto undermine the fighting spirit of the\nplayers in the city, even making them\nquestion him and ultimately causing the\nplayers in the city to turn against him.\nThis is a tried and trueue psychological\ntactic. As early as the Shang and Zhao\ndynasties, Jang Xia used this tactic\nwhen besieging Chaa, and it really\nworked. Learning from history, Fongu\ncertainly didn't intend to follow in the\nfootsteps of King Zhao. So at this\nmoment, his brain began to work at\nlightning speed, thinking about how to\nbreak through St. Paul's open scheme. At\nthat moment, a huge figure flew in from\nthe southern sky, and a deep, angry\nvoice rang out. You lowly insects. This\nis the territory of my dragon, Odum.\nYour clamor is disturbing me. If you\ndon't want to die, shut up. As Odum's\nangry voice rang out, Sao Paulo looked\nup in surprise at the giant dragon\ncircling in the sky and waved his hand\nto stop the clamor of the army behind\nhim. Very well, you insects. This is my\nonly and final warning to you. If you\ndare to cause trouble in my territory\nagain, I will burn you to ashes. With\nthat, Odum swooped down and unleashed a\ntorrent of dragon fire at the open space\nbetween King's Landing and the army.\nInstantly, a wall of flames rose up,\nblocking the path between King's Landing\nand the army outside. Just as the\ndragon's body flew over the city gate\ntower where Fong Yu was, a yellow figure\nleaped off Odum's back and landed at\nFong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s feet. It was Alpha. After\nspewing out the wall of fire, the dragon\nspread its wings and took to the air\nagain, flying towards the dragon's lair\nto the south. Fong Yu glanced at Alfa at\nhis feet, then at the departing Dragon\nOdum, and smiled slightly. Although the\nDragon Odums words were neutral and did\nnot show any favoritism towards either\nside, it is clear that he still wanted\nto maintain his neutral stance. However,\njudging from the current situation,\nOdum's actions undoubtedly did Fongu a\ngreat favor. Not only did he unleash a\nwall of fire to block the enemy's\npossible attack on the city, but he also\nsuppressed the morale of the enemy\ntroops outside the city. Well done,\nAlpha. Fong Yu patted the dog's head and\npraised. You've done me a huge favor.\nWoof. Alpha wagged its tail and grinned.\nAt this time, Sanjiing Lu Xiao Fang and\nother leaders also began to speak out in\nthe sixth district channel, strongly\nsupporting Fong Yu. Song Xing ID 3533.\nDon't listen to those bastards from\nother regions trying to sew Discord. Fu\nhas been helping us since we first\nentered the game, hasn't he? He's\nprovided us with all sorts of useful\nsurvival information. After conquering\nthis ruin occupied by orcs, he led us to\nestablish King's Landing. He's done so\nmuch for us. Lu Xiaoang ID520. That's\nright. Without Fong Yu's help, how could\nour region have become the one with the\nmost survivors among the 10 regions? Lee\nShanlong ID212.\nThose people say we attack players in\nzone 7 and zone 5, but you should all\nknow that except for zone 8, the other\neight zones have united against us.\nThose so-called joint military exercises\nhave even reached our zones border. If\nit weren't for Boss Fong Yu's\nself-defense counterattack, our zone\nmight have been swallowed up by those\neight zones a few days ago. Xiao Yini\nID99. So, everyone must be rational and\nnot let those enemies outside cloud our\njudgment. Once we start to doubt Boss\nFong Yu, we'll give the enemy an\nopportunity. If the enemy really breaks\nthrough this city, do you think they'll\nshow us any mercy? Chun Xiaoyu, ID99.\nYeah, I'd rather believe Fong Yu who\nhelped me than believe the nonsense from\nthose people in other regions. Dong Hao\nID 3356. That makes sense. I also\nsupport Fong Yu Wu Jingia ID757.\nNo matter how many people Fong Yu\nkilled, they were all killed to protect\nour district 6. If we don't kill those\ninvaders beforehand, are we supposed to\nwait for them to come and kill us? Just\nlike now, the enemy is at our gates. We\nshould unite even more. After seeing the\ndragon disappear into the distance, the\nguards on the city walls recalled that a\nfew days ago, Fongu had single-handedly\ndriven away the dragon that was burning\nKing's Landing. In addition, some\nplayers who firmly supported Fong Yu\ndefended his territory in the regional\nchannel. As a result, the guards on the\ncity walls regained their senses. At\nthis moment, they also saw the messages\nsupporting Fong Yu in the chat channel\nof District 6 and their eyes turned back\nto firm trust when they looked at Fong\nYu. At that moment, Fong Yu also posted\na message in the sixth district channel.\nFong Yu ID006 friends, you all know my\ncharacter. While I'm not a saint, if you\ntrust me, I will do my best to protect\nyou. My motto is simple. I will not\noffend others unless they offend me. If\nthey do, I will punish them no matter\nhow far away they are. But now our\nenemies are already bullying us. What do\nyou think we should do? Damn it. A bunch\nof foreigners just know how to bewitch\npeople. Brothers, shoot them dead. An\narcher, perhaps ashamed of his earlier\ndoubts about Fong Yu. Or perhaps unable\nto contain his anger, fired at St. Paul\nbelow the city. Led by this archer, the\nother archers also began to fire their\narrows. Arrows rained down but were\nblocked by a golden shield of light\nsurrounding St. Paul. His expression\nshifted as he glanced at Fong Yu on the\ncity wall. Realizing that his\npsychological tactics had failed, he\nsnorted coldly and turned back to his\narmy. It seems that the only way to get\nrid of Fong Yu is to forcefully conquer\nKing's Landing. However, taking down\nthis town is not an easy task. Although\nintelligence indicates that their forces\noutnumber the enemy by more than four\ntimes without siege equipment, for times\nthe strength is not a significant\nadvantage in a siege. Previously, in\norder to catch Fong Yu offg guard, Sao\nPaulo immediately bypassed district 5\nand launched a surprise attack on Fong\nYu&lt;unk&gt;s territory after persuading the\nother six districts to send a coalition\nforce. He did not expect there would be\na subsequent siege, so he did not\nprepare siege equipment. St. Paul\nimmediately ordered his army to begin\ncutting down the surrounding trees in\npreparation for making siege equipment.\nAlthough this large-scale logging\nquickly elicited a response from the\nforest's will, and Trance soon began to\nappear in the woods, they were quickly\nsurrounded and killed by the army of\ntens of thousands and the attacks of a\ndozen fire mages. When the will of the\nforest was enraged and the entire forest\nbegan to transform into treemen, the\nallied forces had already gathered\nenough timber and withdrawn from the\ntreemen's attack range. Just as Sao\nPaulo was arranging for his army to\nprepare siege equipment, Fong Yuan\ncontacted the Lord of District 8, Viking\nEmperor, and explained the situation of\nDistrict 6 being besieged. The Viking\nEmperor meant that he could send troops\nto help, but Fongu refused. He told the\nViking Emperor to gather a large army as\nsoon as possible and take the\nopportunity to sweep through the weak\n9inth and 10th districts. Upon receiving\nthe message, the Viking Emperor replied\nto Fong Yu with one sentence. Friend, I\nadmire your strategic vision. I will do\nas you say. The reason Fong Yu didn't\nask the Viking Emperor to send\nreinforcements was because he considered\na very practical issue. whether the\nViking Emperor's support was genuine or\nnot. If it was just for show, then it\nwould be better if he didn't come at\nall. However, if he were to take the\nopportunity to annex the sparsely\npopulated districts 9 and 10, Fong Yu\nbelieve that the Viking Emperor would\ndefinitely devote 120% of his energy to\nit. This involves a principle of\ninterpersonal relationships. If you want\nsomeone you don't know very well to help\nyou, you shouldn't ask them to do\nsomething thankless and difficult, but\nrather ask them to do something that\nseems profitable. Only in this way will\nthe other person be willing to put in a\nlot of effort to help you. Once the\nViking Emperor begins attacking\ndistricts 9 and 10, it will become a\nsurprise attack, forcing players in\ndistricts 9 and 10 to return to defend.\nThe allied forces outside the city will\nthen collapse without a fight and their\ncombat power will be greatly reduced.\nAnd when that time comes, it will be\nFong used time to launch a\ncounterattack. Chapter 188 Explosive\nCrossbow Upgrade version 2.0. War is\nnever a simple game of offense and\ndefense, but a holistic and\ncomprehensive contest. Although Fong Yu\nhad never experienced war, as a writer,\nhe had read many books related to war\nsince childhood. He was familiar with\nthe strategies of alliances and counter\nalliances and the 36 strategys, but he\ncould still occasionally use one or two\nof them. In the afternoon, the 11 mages\nopposite seemed to have fully recovered\ntheir magic power and began to approach\nthe city with their defensive shields,\nattempting to bombard the city walls\nwith fireballs. However, with Fong Yu in\ncharge, he expanded the range of the\nguardian stone to its maximum, leaving\nthe mages with no choice but to retreat\nempty-handed. At this moment, Fongu was\nalso slightly relieved that there was no\nintermediate earth mage on the other\nside. Otherwise, if an intermediate\nearth-based sinkhole spell were cast on\nthe foundation of the city wall, it\nwould be dangerous. As evening\napproached, the enemy finally erected\nsix catapults, each over 10 m tall, and\nbegan loading them with ammunition.\nAlthough the catapults were positioned\nonly 200 m from the city wall within the\narcher's range, Fong Yu personally fired\nan arrow at it, only to find that the\narrow was blocked by a golden light\nshield. It turned out that a white robed\nman with golden eyes stood beside each\ncatapult. He seemed to be a servant of\nSt. Paul. Fong Yu didn't know the\nspecific strength of those servants. But\nthe holy light shields they released\nwere ineffective against not only\nordinary arrows, but even the fireballs\nthat Fong Yu threw later were useless.\nBut Fongu had other ideas. So Fong Yu\nled Olivia to the top of the city gate\ntower where the only dragon hunting\ncrossbow was mounted. Previously, the\ntower had been covered with black cloth\nso that it could be used as a surprise\nweapon when necessary. Now it was time\nfor it to make its appearance. As the\nblack cloth fell under Olivia's personal\ncontrol, the ballista quickly aimed at a\ncatapult. Before the enemy could react,\naccompanied by a low creek of a hinge\nloosening. A crossbow bolt more than 2 m\nlong shot straight at the catapult below\nthe city. At this moment, the white\nrobed goldeneyed man next to the\ncatapult that was being targeted seemed\nto have noticed the huge crossbow bolt\nshooting in his direction. In a great\nalarm, he activated his holy light\nshield to its maximum strength, but it\nwas still to no avail. The Dragon Hunter\ncrossbow bolt with spiraling edge blades\neasily shattered the Holy Light shield\nand plunged into the catapult. Before\nanyone could react, another burst of\nlight erupted, and the catapult\nexploded. The three enemy soldiers\noperating it were killed instantly, and\neven the white robed goldeneyed man was\nthrown back by the powerful blast wave.\nThe catapult was quickly engulfed in\nflames. Watching the catapult engulfed\nin flames, Fong Yu, standing in front of\nthe ballista, smiled slightly, and took\nout another explosive charge, which he\nthen attached to the newly loaded dragon\nhunting crossbow bolt. He then turned to\nOlivia and smiled. Continue. The second\none. I want to see if they can withstand\nthis upgraded version 2.0 of the\nexplosive crossbow. As the second\nexplosive dragon slaying bolt was fired\nat the second catapult, St. Paul had\nalready arrived at the catapult himself.\nHe raised his white crystal staff high,\nand the white crystal on the staff\ninstantly lit up with a dazzling light.\nImmediately, a holy shield wielding\nangel phantom appeared in midair, and\nthe arrow head of the dragon- hunting\ncrossbow struck the light shield in the\nangel's hand, but was actually blocked.\nTwo seconds later, an explosion and a\nburst of light engulfed the phantom of\nthe two-winged angel, which was more\nthan 4 m tall. But when the fire and\nsmoke dissipated, the phantom of the\nshield wielding angel was found to be\ncompletely intact. Holy crap, what kind\nof magic is that? Fongu exclaimed in\nsurprise. Olivia, standing behind the\ndragon slayer ballista, said, \"That's a\nunique skill of the priest of light,\nangel's protection. Can he be\ninvincible? Olivia shook her head and\nsaid, \"Judging from the fact that the\nangel only has two wings, it should be a\nbeginner level angel of protection. The\nnext level is a four-winged angel and\nthen a six-winged angel. This dragon\nhunting crossbow can't penetrate it.\"\nFunu frowned. It's difficult. We need at\nleast 10 shots, but we only have eight\ndragon hunting bolts left. At this\nmoment, Fong Yu took out 10 simple\nexplosive packs from his storage ring\nand asked, \"How many of these do I need\nto hang 10 of them at once?\" A moment\nlater, another dragon- hunting crossbow\nbolt was fired at St. Paul's angel of\nprotection. St. Paul grinned, thinking\nto himself, \"Let's see how many bolts\nyou have.\" But the next instant, he saw\na long string of explosives hanging from\nthe bolts tip. Holy Before Sao\nPaulo and those around him could react,\nthe arrow had already struck the shield\nof the angelic phantom once again. Boom!\nBoom! Boom! As a series of violent\nexplosions rang out, the enemy army\nformation outside the defensive range of\nAngel's protection was instantly blown\ndown by the shock waves. And when the\nflames and smoke dissipated, the phantom\nof the shield wielding Angel had also\ndimmed considerably. MTF. Sa Paulo\ncursed angrily. How did that bastard get\na dragon slayer ballista and so many\nexplosive charges, too? These dragon\nhunting crossbow bolts, each carrying 10\nexplosive charges, are basically no\ndifferent from missiles. Although his\nangel's protection defense is very\nstrong, it is still only at a basic\nlevel. It's already quite good that he\ncan withstand one shot. If he takes\nanother, he really won't be able to\nwithstand it. But as if on Q, the third\ndragon hunting crossbow bolt was already\nbeing fired towards Sao Paulo. Knowing\nhe couldn't block the arrow, St. Paul\nhad no choice but to cast a holy light\nshield on himself immediately and then\nleap away to dodge. Boom! Boom! Boom!\nAfter another series of violent\nexplosions, the angelic phantom\nshattered instantly. The fierce flames\nand shock waves were no longer\nobstructed, engulfing not only the\ncatapults behind it, but also a white\nrobed goldeneyed man standing nearby. A\nmoment later, St. Paul scrambled to his\nfeet, about to hurl another curse, when\nhe suddenly sensed something and turned\nto look at the epicenter of the\nexplosion. There he saw a figure\nengulfed in flames burst forth from the\nblast, collapsing in front of St. Paul\nwith a groan. It was one of his 12\nservants. At this moment, Fong Yu on the\ncity wall looked at the figure covered\nin flames lying next to St. Paul raised\nhis eyebrows slightly and smiled. \"He, I\ndidn't expect there to be an unexpected\nsurprise. I wonder if it can kill that\nguy.\" Olivia, standing to the side,\nshook her head and replied, \"That guy\nhas golden eyes, so he should be a\nreincarnated angel. He won't die so\neasily, but he should have lost his\nability to fight. Oh, that's a pity.\"\nFong Yu then picked up another explosive\ncharge, attached it to the crossbow\nbolt, and said, \"All right, let's\ncontinue. Take out the remaining four\ncatapults as well.\" Thus, under the\npowerful penetrating force of the Dragon\nSlayer ballista and the explosion of the\nimprovised explosive charge, the\nremaining four unprotected catapults\nwere quickly destroyed. seeing his\ncatapults, which he had painstakingly\nbuilt up over the course of an\nafternoon, destroyed in the blink of an\neye, and with one of his servants also\nseverely injured and rendered incapable\nof fighting, St. Paul was filled with\nrage. He turned around and summoned the\nbattle group commander, ordering him to\nbegin a direct assault on the city.\nSoon, the enemy army began to adjust its\nformation with a large number of\nshieldbearers at the forefront, covering\na wooden battering ram that resembled a\nsmall house as it slowly approached\nKing's Landing. Seeing this, Fongu knew\nthat the enemy's first siege was about\nto begin. Chapter 189. Siege battle.\nAlert. At Olivia's command from the city\ngate tower, more than 1,000 archers who\nhad been training and rehearsing all\nafternoon in the passageways on both\nsides of the city wall quickly came to\nthe battlementss, took down their long\nbows, knocked them, and entered a state\nof combat readiness. Meanwhile, the\nmelee guards who hadn't been assigned\nbows and arrows stood next to the\narchers, holding their shields,\nfollowing Olivia's afternoon drill\nroutine. As the enemy formation slowly\nentered the range of the arrows, Olivia\ndid not rush to order the archers to\nfire, but waited. Because most of the\narchers on the city wall were just there\nto fill positions, there were only a few\ndozen real professional archers. To make\nthese 1,000 plus amateur archers unleash\ntheir true killing power. The range had\nto be reduced from the original 250 m to\n150 m. Most importantly, the enemy's\nfront line consisted entirely of shield\ninfantry, and the projectile damage from\narrows had little effect on them. So,\nshe waited for the enemy archers behind\nthe shield infantry to come into range.\nHowever, before that, the city's only\nthree low-level fire mages under\nOlivia's command arrived at the city\nwall and began chanting fireball spells,\nbombarding the enemy troops outside the\ncity who had entered the magic range\nwith fireballs. Fireballs can be guided\nby mental energy to curve, thus killing\nshieldbearers. Judging from the\nequipment of the mages on both sides, it\nseems that more than 90% of the mages\ninitially chose fire magic. This is\nunderstandable since fire magic has the\nhighest damage for low-level mages,\nmaking it convenient to hunt beasts in\nthe early stages. In addition, there is\na fire shield, which can be considered\nas both offensive and defensive. In\nlarge-scale wars, fire mages are the\nmost terrifying of all troop types. A\nhighle fire mage could wipe out a\nthousand strong infantry battalion with\na single fire meteor. Unfortunately,\nOlivia only had three low-level mages at\nher disposal, enough to fire a few\nfireballs and barely managed to kill\nsome of the enemy troops. As for Fong\nYu, who was at the intermediate level of\nmage, Olivia did not let him make a move\nbecause Fong Yu needed to maintain his\ncondition to deal with the opposing mage\ngroup. After all, the opposing mage\ngroup had nine low-level mages and three\nintermediate level mages. Soon, the\nenemy shield infantry had advanced to\nwithin 100 m of the city wall, while the\narchers behind them had entered a 150 m\nrange, firing from low to high to try\nand hit the guards on the city wall.\nThese archers could only get within 150\nm. This means that both sides archery\nunits have entered firing range, and\nthis is exactly the moment Olivia has\nbeen waiting for. Archers, full draw,\nfiring straight. Olivia's loud voice\nrang out from the city wall. At this\nmoment, the archers of the attacking\narmy outside the city had just received\norders to stop, draw their bows, and\nprepare to fire a barrage of arrows at\nthe guards on the city wall. But when\nthey looked up at the city wall, they\nsaw a black rain of arrows flying up\nfrom the wall and heading straight for\nthem. 3 seconds later, thousands of\narrows rained down on the enemy archers\noutside the city. Cries of agony filled\nthe air as hundreds of archers fell to\nthe ground. Some killed instantly by\nfatal wounds, others clutching their\nnon-fatal injuries and howling in pain.\nHowever, the attacking army's archer\nformation numbered over 4,000. Although\nthey were a step behind the defending\narchers on the city wall, they still\nbraved the reign of arrows and began\nfiring at the city wall. Upon seeing\nthis, Olivia, who had been observing the\nenemy's situation, immediately issued a\nsecond order. Archers, hold back.\nShieldbears, raise your shields. At\nOlivia's command, the melee guards\nsurrounding the archers raised their\nshields, and the archers all ducked\nbehind them. 3 seconds later, more than\n3,000 arrows rained down on the city\nwall passageway. But apart from a few\nguards and archers whose buttocks were\nsticking out of their shields and being\nwounded by stray arrows, there were no\nother casualties. After the volley of\narrows passed, Olivia shouted again,\n\"Shieldbearers, raise your shields.\" So\nall the shieldbearers raised their\nshields high above their heads, placing\nthem on top of their own archers and on\nthe krenellations of the city wall.\nArchers, fire freely from behind the\nkrenellations. Focus fire on the enemy\narcher formation first. Olivia continued\nto command. So the archers got up, drew\ntheir bows, and began firing freely at\nthe enemy troops on the ground from the\nkrenellations. With the shields of the\nshieldbearers providing protection, most\nof the arrows thrown up by the enemy\nwere blocked by the shields due to the\nangle. Only a small number of\nprofessional archers were able to barely\nfire at the archers peeking out from the\nkrenellations of the wall. With Olivia's\ndesign of a combined offensive and\ndefensive strategy involving shield,\ninfantry, and archers, coupled with the\nadvantageous terrain of the city walls,\nthe enemy's numerical advantage in\narchers was quickly neutralized.\nFurthermore, the archers on the city\nwalls due to their high angle shots had\nfar greater penetrating power and\naccuracy than the enemy archers outside\nthe city. In an instant, archers outside\nthe city began to fall in droves. While\nthe archers defending the city only had\na few unlucky archers who were\noccasionally hit by pre-amed shots from\nthe enemy's professional archers or by\nstray arrows coming from the side.\nJudging from the casualty ratio alone,\nthe ratio of casualties among the\ndefending archers to those attacking\narchers was roughly 110. With 1,000\narchers against 4,000 archers, achieving\nsuch a kill ratio was simply\nunbelievable to Fong Yu, who was\nwatching from the sidelines. Of course,\nif you take into account the 1,000\nshield soldiers responsible for holding\nup the shields on the side, as well as\nthe geographical advantage of the city\nwalls, it is understandable. It was only\nat this moment that Fong Yu realized\nthat Olivia's true strength was not her\nclose combat ability or immortality, but\nher unparalleled war command ability.\n\"He truly is a ruler who once commanded\nan army of millions,\" Fongu thought to\nhimself. His command abilities are\nsimply superb. \"Meanwan, the enemy's\nvanguard of shield soldiers outside the\ncity had arrived at the foot of the city\nwall. While holding up their shields,\nthey took out the siege ladders they had\nmade in advance from their backpacks and\nbegan to set them up. There were even a\nfew woodtype mages mixed in with them\nwho used vine magic to grow vines on the\ncity wall that people could climb. Upon\nseeing the siege ladders laid out at the\nkrenellations of the wall, Olivia turned\nto Fong Yu and said, \"Master, it's your\nturn. Use the fire dragon technique to\nburn all these ladders down.\" Fongu\nnodded, leaped onto the city wall,\nraised his staff to summon two fire\ndragons, and began sweeping them towards\nthe siege ladders erected outside the\nwalls. With the guardian stone on him,\nhe had no fear of the arrows being\nhurled at him. Soon, the siege ladders\nalong the wall were ignited by the\nflying fire dragons, and the vines that\nwere spreading on the city wall were\nalso set ablaze. When the two fire\ndragons reached the ends of the city\nwalls, Fong Yu turned them around and\ncharged towards the enemy troops on the\nground. He then began burning the enemy\nsoldiers huddled at the base of the\nwalls. Just then, the three intermediate\nfire mages in the enemy's formation\nfinally made their move, sending three\nfire dragons soaring into the air and\nattacking the city wall. Two fire\ndragons headed towards the passageways\non the left and right sides of the city\nwall, while another fire dragon headed\ndirectly towards the cannon tower on the\ntop of the city gate. Fong Yu also\nnoticed the three fire dragons released\nby the enemy mage immediately,\nespecially the two fire dragons that\nflew towards the passageways on both\nsides of the city wall. If those two\nfire dragons were allowed to rampage and\nsweep across the narrow city wall\npassageway, the defending soldiers with\nnowhere to hide would all be engulfed by\nthe fire dragons. The defensive\ncounterattack force on the city wall\nwould be completely wiped out. So, you\ndidn't even need Olivia's reminder. He\nimmediately made the two fire dragons\nthat were still raging on the ground\nexplode on the spot. Then he quickly\nsummoned two water elemental minions at\nthe locations where the fire dragons\nattacked on both sides of the city wall.\nHe let the water elemental minions use\ntheir more than 3 m tall bodies to\nwithstand the impact of the fire\ndragons. He himself instantly cast wind\ndance and soar into the air, crashing\ninto the last fire dragon that was\nheading towards the dragon hunting\nballista on the top of the city gate\ntower. Bang! With a burst of sparks\nflying, Fong Yu used his body and the\nlight shield of the guardian stone to\nblock the attack of the dragon slayer\nballista, successfully blocking the fire\ndragon spell. The price was that the\nguardian stone instantly absorbed 50\npoints of his magic power. Trading 50\nmagic points for a fire dragon isn't a\nbad deal, especially since he also\nmanaged to save the dragon hunting\nballista behind him. To prevent the\nDragon Hunter ballista from being\nattacked again, Funyu turned around and\nflew to the turret, storing the Dragon\nHunter ballista in his storage ring. At\nthis moment, the water elementals on\nboth sides successfully blocked and\nextinguished the two fire dragons with\ntheir bodies and then began to use water\nto wash away the guards that had been\nignited by the fire dragons. Although\nwater elementals lack the flightability\nand terrifying destructive power of fire\ndragons, their survivability, or rather\ntheir health, is significantly higher.\nTherefore, they were still able to\nsurvive after extinguishing the two fire\ndragons. However, much of their water\nelement was evaporated during the battle\nwith the fire dragons, and their bodies,\nwhich were originally more than 3 m\ntall, are now only more than 2 m tall.\nBefore Fong Yu could even catch his\nbreath, the enemy's three intermediate\nfire mages summoned three more fire\ndragons along with eight fireballs fired\nby low-level mages. Fong Yu side\nimmediately took out a magic crystal\nfrom his storage ring. And while\nrestoring his magic power, he summoned\ntwo water elemental servants on both\nsides of the city wall again and then\nflew into the sky again to crash into\nthe third fire dragon. As for the eight\nfireballs, he was truly helpless and\ncould only hope that the four water\nelemental minions on both sides of the\ncity wall could come to the rescue of\nthe guards hit by the fireballs. At this\nmoment, St. Paul, standing behind the\narmy formation below the city, was\nsecretly astonished by the series of\nactions taken by Fong Yu on the city\nwall. It seems I underestimated Fong Yu.\nA mid-level mage can actually withstand\nthe attacks of three mid-level mages\nwithout being at a disadvantage. and\neven dares to use his own body as a meat\nshield to withstand the damage of the\nfire dragon spell. Tsk tsk impressive.\nBut then Sao Paulo said to the 11\nservants behind him. In that case, you\nmay all come up with us. Then the 11\nwhite robed goldeneyed servants stepped\nout from the rear of the army and walked\ntowards the attacking force. At the same\ntime, beams of holy light began to fly\nfrom their hands and land on the archers\nwho had been shot and wounded. Soon, the\narchers who had been wounded and fallen\nto the ground stopped groaning, began to\npull out the arrows from their bodies,\nand stood up again. Meanwhile, the\nslowmoving siege rams finally arrived at\nthe gates of King's Landing. The\nsoldiers inside the rams shook the huge\nsharp wooden stakes and rammed them\nagainst the massive city gates. Thump!\nThe city gate trembled violently from\nthe impact and a deep crack appeared at\nthe point of impact. Chapter 190. Siege\nbattle 2. Boom. Amidst the flying\nsparks, Fong Yu, who had once again\nextinguished the second fire dragon in\nmidair with his own body, also felt a\nwave of dizziness. He shook his head\nslightly and turned to look at both\nsides of the city wall, where the two\nfire dragons there had also been\nextinguished by the four water elemental\nservants summoned by Fong Yu. Fong Yu\nturned his head to look at the enemy's\nformation, wanting to see what tricks\nthe enemy mages were planning to use.\nBut as soon as he looked down, he saw\nthe holy light flashing frequently in\nthe enemy's formation. When he saw the\nwounded enemy archers rise again, bathed\nin holy light, his brow furrowed. Holy\ncrap, it even has battle resurrection.\nFong Yu couldn't help but curse out,\n\"Fuck you. Priests are disgusting.\" Just\nas Fong Yu was venting his anger, the\nenemy's mage formation seemed to be\nangered by Fong Yu's two acts of taking\ndown their six fire dragons. So, this\ntime, the three intermediate fire mages\nand eight low-level fire mages all\nturned their attention to Fong Yu. They\ndecided to take down this arrogant guy\nfirst. Then the three fire dragons that\nrose up again along with eight fireballs\nflew towards Fong Yu. Seeing this scene,\nFong Yu also felt a chill run down his\nspine. Although he knew he could\nwithstand the attack with the guardian\nstone, the visual impact of seeing three\nfire dragons and eight fireballs flying\ntowards him was still too strong.\nHowever, at that moment, Fongu suddenly\nfelt a pang of fear in his heart. At the\nsame time, Olivia's voice came from the\ncity wall. Master, watch out above. Upon\nhearing the sound, Fun Yu quickly looked\nup and saw a bright golden light\ncrashing down towards his head. His\nintuition told him that the damage from\nthat golden light was likely even\ngreater than that from the fire dragon\ntechnique. He tried to use the power of\nthe dance of wind to quickly teleport,\nbut to his surprise, a cylindrical cage\nof light appeared around his body. He\nwas now unable to move. This means that\nhe is about to be subjected to a barrage\nof magical attacks and he has no choice\nbut to withstand it. What to do? In the\nnick of time, Fongu forced himself to\ncalm down quickly and began to think of\na solution. At this moment, St. Paul,\nwho was casting a spell on the ground,\nsmiled slightly. Holy light judgment,\none of the few offensive skills of the\nlight element, not only contains\nextremely hot holy flames, but can also\ndirectly damage the enemy's soul. It can\nbe said to be an extremely powerful\noffensive skill. Combined with the\ncontrol skill light imprisonment, it can\nensure that holy light judgment hits the\ntarget 100% of the time. If this combo\nis used unexpectedly in a one-on-one\nfight, it can almost instantly kill all\nopponents, and it's an annihilation from\nthe soul level. Even if Fong Yu managed\nto survive the Holy Light Judgment with\nthree fire dragons and eight fireballs\nfollowing closely behind, St. Paul\ndidn't believe that Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s\ndefensive treasures could withstand so\nmuch damage at once. When the holy\nlight, like a shooting star, struck Fong\nYu, who was imprisoned in midair, St.\nPaul smiled. And when the subsequent\nalso hit Fong Yu, who was shrouded in\nholy light, St. Paul's smile became even\nbrighter. As long as he eliminates Fong\nYu, the dark gods representative who\nposes the greatest threat to him. It\ndoesn't matter if he loses this siege\nbattle. This world will be his sooner or\nlater. However, as the flames died down,\nSt. Paul's smile froze on his face.\nWithin the cage of holy light in midair,\na tall red figure still stood there.\nThat guy didn't die. How is this\npossible? Not only was St. Paul stunned,\nbut even the 11 fire mages who had\nattacked together stared wideeyed in\nastonishment, their expressions\nincredulous. Fong Yu survived because at\nthe very last moment, he came up with a\nsolution. The skill gained after\nabsorbing the heart of the fire dragon\nhas been activated. Fire dragon scale\narmor. It can increase strength by 30%\nand greatly increase physical and\nmagical resistance for 10 minutes.\nTherefore, under the triple protection\nof the guardian stone's light shield,\nthe fire dragon scale armors protection,\nand the purple light shield of the\nundeads lament, he successfully withtood\nthis combined fatal blow from the local\nmages. At this moment, Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s\nentire body was covered with a layer of\ncrimson scales. Although the scorching\nfire element was still attached to his\nbody and burning, even burning and\ndeforming his wild boar king assault\nsuit, it could not harm the crimson\nscales on Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s skin because the\nfire dragon scales could withstand\nextremely high temperatures.\nImmediately, Fong Yu stretched out his\nhands, which were like dragon claws, and\ngrabbed the cage made of holy light in\nfront of him. He roared angrily and used\nhis powerful strength to tear the cage\nof holy light that imprisoned him.\nHowever, having exhausted his magic\npower, he could no longer maintain the\nflight state of the dance of the wind\nand fell to the ground. Just as he was\nfalling, Fongu took out the black gold\nancient blade from his storage ring and\nlaunched a savage charge at the white\nrobed goldeneyed man closest to him on\nthe ground. The fire dragon scale armor\nlasts for 10 minutes during which time\nhis physical and magical defenses are\nalmost at the level of a dragon and his\nstrength is also increased by 30%. Under\nthis state, even if he does not use\nmagic, he is almost invincible in melee\ncombat. So, he decided to take advantage\nof the buff before it disappeared and\nkill as many of St. Paul's servants as\npossible. The goldeneyed servant\ntargeted by Fong Yu seemed surprised\nthat Fong Yu would choose him as a\ntarget. In his astonishment, he\nimmediately conjured a shield of holy\nlight in front of him. However, under\nFong Yu's fallen strike, the shield only\nblocked the black gold ancient blade for\na moment before shattering.\nNevertheless, the shield did manage to\nnegate the stun effect of the savage\ncharge. But then, the golden eyed\nservant was astonished to see the long\nblade pierce through his chest. However,\nthis goldeneyed servant was no ordinary\nperson. Despite the heavy blow, it was\nstill able to retreat quickly, breaking\nfree from the blade, causing Fong Yu's\nintended downward strike to miss.\nAlthough his attack missed, Fong Yu had\nno intention of letting the Golden Eyed\nservant go. He kicked off the ground\nwith both feet and shot at the servant\nlike an arrow. This time, the goldeneyed\nservant was unable to dodge the attack\nand was stabbed in the left chest by the\nancient sword. Fongu did not give the\nservant a chance to dodge again and\npulled the blade to the lower right.\nSnap! With a crisp cracking sound, the\nancient sword cleaved a huge gash from\nthe left chest to the lower right\nabdomen of the goldeneyed servant.\nInstantly, his shattered internal organs\nand blood gushed out from the gash, and\nthe goldeneyed servant collapsed to the\nground in disbelief. Fong Yu gave his\nopponent no chance to turn the tables.\nHe took another step forward and slashed\nthe goldeneyed servant across the neck\nwith his sword, completely separating\nhis head from his body. As the golden\nlight in the eyes of the goldeneyed\nservant gradually faded, Fongu thought\nhe had finally dealt with the guy, but\nin the next instant, a golden light\nsuddenly burst out from the corpse, and\nthen a golden phantom flew out from the\ncorpse and spread out a pair of wings.\nIt was actually the soul of an angel.\nThe golden angel's soul glared at Fong\nYu with resentment, preparing to turn\nand spread its wings to fly towards the\nrear of the army. Seeing this, Fongu\nguessed that if he let this guy go back,\nSt. Paul would definitely have a way to\nresurrect him. So, Fongu raised his left\nhand and manipulated the Reququum of the\nDead to release a purple light chain\ntowards the Golden Angel soul, which\nthen entangled the golden angel soul.\nSeeing that it was bound by the purple\nchains, the angel's soul began to\nstruggle desperately. As it struggled,\nthe purple chains began to break down.\nBut Funyu did not give up. Instead, he\nused the reququum of the dead to shoot\nout two more chains to bind the angel's\nsoul. At this moment, two white-roed\ngoldeneyed servants who were nearby\narrived. One of them took out a pale\ngold long sword and slashed at Fong Yu\nwhile the other goldeneyed servant cast\na light magic spell on Fong Yu. Holy\nlight impact in an attempt to interrupt\nFong Yu's spell-casting. However, Fong\nYu did not back down while tightly\ngripping the purple light chain in his\nhand. He used his melee skill draw sword\nslash on the goldeneyed servant with a\nsword rushing towards him. A flash of\nlight flew from the blade of the black\ngold ancient blade, slashing towards the\ngolden blade servant, forcing him to\nparry. Fongu was also struck by the holy\nlight. Although the dragon scales helped\nhim absorb most of the magical damage,\nit still deducted 50 points of his\nstamina. The intense impact also caused\nhim to spit out a mouthful of blood.\nHowever, he still did not release the\npurple light chain. Instead, he roared\nand used his powerful strength to pull\nthe angel's soul in midair directly to\nhis side. Submit to me. With a loud\nshout from Fong Yu, the elegy of the\ndead suddenly erupted with a burst of\nintense purple light, which instantly\nenveloped the golden angel's soul and\npulled it into the ring. Upon witnessing\nthis scene, the golden sword servant's\neyes widened in fury. He shouted,\n\"Raphael!\" and his eyes flashed with\ngolden light. The golden sword in his\nhand also shone with golden light as he\ncharged towards Fong Yu once more. Then\nthe goldeneyed servant behind him who\nhad released the holy light impact let\nout a shrill howl, his whole body\nradiating golden light, and he actually\nreleased the holy light judgment that\nSt. Paul had used earlier. Instantly, a\ngolden stream of light condensed in\nmidair and crashed down towards Fongu.\nAt the same time, eight other goldeneyed\nservants nearby, including St. Paul also\nsurrounded Fong Yu. Just at this\ncritical moment, a giant dog the size of\nan ox with horns on its head and red fur\nsprang out from behind Fong Yu and\npounced on the golden sword servant who\nwas about to slash Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s head\nwith his sword. Immediately afterwards,\na tall figure appeared behind Fong Yu.\nOlivia grabbed Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s waist and\npulled him backward, who was almost\nexhausted. At the same time, she used\nthe iron axe in her hand to block a\nsword from a goldeneyed servant standing\nnearby and led Fong Yu away from the\nencircling circle that was about to\nclose in. At the same time, a figure\nwith flowing silver hair appeared in\nmidair. A dazzling purple six-pointed\nstar magic circle lit up on the forehead\nof the female ghost Valentina. Then a\nvisible purple fan-shaped soul shock\nwave radiated from her body, sweeping\nacross the 10 goldeneyed servants in St.\nPaul, causing them to become momentarily\ndisoriented. Taking advantage of this\ngap, Valentina unleashed a wind dance on\nOlivia, helping her fly directly towards\nthe city wall. Alpha, not wanting to\nlinger, also turned and retreated\ntowards the city wall. By the time the\n10 goldeneyed servants and St. Paul\nregained their senses and prepared to\npursue again. Valentina in midair had\nalready cast her next spell. The next\nsecond, the weeds on the ground suddenly\nbegan to grow wildly, quickly wrapping\naround the ankles of the 10 goldeneyed\nservants and St. Paul, rendering them\nunable to move. Woodtype intermediate\nspell, wild growth, which can instantly\ncatalyze the rapid growth of surrounding\nplants, attacking or binding nearby\nenemies. Left with no other option, Sao\nPaulo could only shout, \"Kill that\nmagician first.\" Then the 10 goldeneyed\nservants unleashed beams of holy light\nmagic at Valentina in midair. However,\nValentina, with her magic fully\nunleashed, merely smiled slightly,\nsnapped her fingers, and vanished into\nthin air before the holy light spells\ncould reach her. The next instant, her\nfigure appeared at top the city wall.\nIntermediate spatial spell instant\nteleportation allows the user to move to\nany location within a range of 1000 0 1\n0 0 meters. The distance traveled\ndepends on the caster's mana. Battle\nmages are among the most terrifying\nbeings in war, and all elemental battle\nmages are the best of the best. It can\nattack or defend, keep its opponent at\nbay, and employ a variety of tactics,\nmaking it a nightmare for enemy forces\nin war. Seeing Fong Yu being carried\nonto the city wall by Olivia, St. Paul\ngritted his teeth in anger. Just then,\nthe battering ram at the city gate\nfinally broke open the gates of King's\nLanding. Upon seeing the collapsed city\ngate, Sao Paulo was furious and\nimmediately ordered his entire army. All\ntroops attack. Victory is within reach.\nJust then, a deafening roar came from\nthe gates of King's Landing. A 10-meter\nlong earth dragon suddenly rushed out of\nthe city gate, crushing the siege rams\nin front of it with its two feet and\nthen charged into the shield soldiers in\nfront of it and began to slaughter them.\nImmediately afterwards, a large number\nof fully armed soldiers poured out of\nthe city gates and began to fight the\nattacking army outside the city. Chapter\n191, the siege battle ends. Hearing\ndeafening roars and the clash of swords\ncoming from below the city, Fong Yu knew\nthat the city gates must have been\nbreached and the two sides had entered\ninto hand-to-hand combat. At that\nmoment, an archer turned to Fong Yu and\nshouted, \"Boss Lee Shanlong and the\nothers have left the city gate.\" Upon\nhearing this, Fongu frowned immediately.\nWho let him out? Fong Yu anxiously\npushed Olivia aside, rushed to the city\nwall, and looked down. Sure enough, he\nsaw Lie Chan Long riding on the Earth\nDragon in front of the city gate, who\nhad already rushed out dozens of meters,\nand there were hundreds of warriors who\nrushed out with him. \"That idiot. He had\nsuch a good defensive position with such\nstrong walls, and instead went out to\nthrow his life away,\" Fongu said\nangrily. \"Absolutely stupid.\" Sure\nenough, in less than a minute, the\ndefending troops who rushed out were\nsurrounded by an enemy force several\ntimes their size, and the enemy was\nflanking them from both sides, trying to\ncut off their retreat. Seeing this, Fong\nYu, who was already seriously injured,\nwas overcome with anger and rage, and\ncoughed up a mouthful of blood,\nstaggering to the side. Fortunately,\nOlivia, who was nearby, caught him\nquickly and helped him into the city\ngate tower. Fong Yu grabbed Olivia's arm\nanxiously and said, \"Quick, you need to\ntake men to meet them at the city gate.\nOtherwise, they're doomed.\" Olivia\nnodded and said to Fong Yu, \"Master,\ndon't worry about the battlefield for\nnow. You should get some rest.\" At that\nmoment, Valentina floated over and said\nto Fong Yu, \"Master, don't worry. Leave\nthe rest to me.\" Fongu glanced at\nValentina, took out the all elemental\nmagic staff from his storage ring,\nhanded it to Valentina, and said, \"Thank\nyou for your hard work.\" Valentina used\nher magic to receive the all-elemental\nwand, smiled slightly, and then turned\nand flew towards the city wall. Olivia\ntold Alpha beside her to protect her\nmaster before rushing down the stairs\ninside the city with her iron axe to\norganize people to meet up with Lee\nChunlong and his men who were besieged\noutside the city. Fongu took out a magic\ncrystal from his storage ring and began\nto absorb its magic power. At the same\ntime, he took out some ointment he had\nprepared in advance and applied it to\nthe wounds on his body that had been\nscorched by the holy flames. Although\ndragon scales could negate most of the\nmagic damage after taking several magic\nattacks from the enemy, Fongu still had\nmany wounds on his body. His maximum\nstamina of 200 was reduced to less than\n40 points. His magic power was only one\npoint and even his spirit was only 55\npoints. Sigh. Fongued. I don't know how\nlong it will take to recover. So Fong Yu\nsaid to Alpha who was guarding him. Why\ndon't you go outside and help Tina and\nVia too? However, Alfa firmly shook its\nhead and pllopped down in front of\nFongu. At this moment, Fong Yu finally\ngot a good look at Alfa's appearance. He\nraised his eyebrows slightly and said,\n\"I didn't expect you to finally grow\nhorns. I must say, you look much more\nhandsome now than before. You look a bit\nlike a blood chillin.\" No, Chillin has\nscales, but you don't. If I had to say,\nyou look more like the legendary hoe.\nAlpha tilted its head and let out a\ncurious whimper. Fongu smiled and was\nabout to explain what a hoe was when\nsuddenly Alpha turned its head to look\nin the direction of the gate, let out a\nlow growl, and revealed its sharp fangs.\nThe next second, it transformed into a\nred shadow and pounced on the gate. Ah!\nWith a scream, Alpha bit into the air.\nSurprisingly, the seemingly empty air\nquickly spurtded blood as Alpha tore at\nit. Then, an assassin dressed in black\nleather armor appeared in front of\nAlpha, and Alpha's fangs were stuck in\nhis neck. Alpha quickly spat out the\nassassin whose neck had been bitten off,\nturned around, and lunged towards the\ndoor again. \"WTF?\" A classic curse came\nfrom the gate, and then Fong You saw a\nstrange and distorted transparent figure\nappear in the air. The figure was\nquickly fleeing towards the gate and it\nseemed to be an assassin with the\nability to become invisible. However,\nthe assassin's speed was no match for\nAlphas. After another scream, another\nfigure in black leather armor appeared\nin the air and died under Alpha's fangs.\nLooking at the two assassins who had\ndied tragically, Fongu revealed a cold\nsmile. Invisibility in front of my dog,\nyou're nothing. At this moment, beneath\nthe walls of King's Landing, Valentina\nused her magic to lift her staff, which\nfloated above Li Chunlong&lt;unk&gt;s troops.\nWith the blessing of the staff, earthn\nwalls rose from the ground, forming a\nsemi-ircular fortification that quickly\nseparated the enemy forces surrounding\nLie Chunlong and his men. Then more than\na dozen invisible wind blades swiftly\nswept across the necks of the enemy\nsoldiers inside the earthn walls,\neliminating nearly a hundred enemy\nsoldiers in just a few breaths.\nImmediately, Valentina floated to the\ntop of Lien's head, who was riding on\nthe back of the earth dragon and\nshouted, \"Return to the city.\"\nimmediately. Liechin Long naturally\nrecognized Valentina. At this moment, he\nrealized that going out of the city to\nfight was a huge mistake because this\nmistake had already resulted in the\ndeaths of nearly 200 soldiers who had\ngone out of the city with him. So, he\nhad no face to say anything and shouted\nto his surviving comrades, \"Brothers,\nretreat.\" Just as Lie Chunlong was\ndirecting the surviving soldiers to\nretreat towards the city gate, the\nearthn wall was quickly pushed down by\nthe enemy soldiers outside. But what the\nenemy did not expect was that what\nawaited them were three giant fire\ndragons with a body length of more than\n10 m. When the three giant fire dragons\nrushed toward the enemy troops outside\nthe earthn wall, the enemy troops\npanicked. Fear began to dominate their\nminds and they began to turn and scatter\nand flee. In an instant, the situation\non the battlefield was reversed. The\nguards on the city wall began to cheer.\nHoly crap, that flying silverhaired,\nwhich is a player from our King's\nLanding. I've never seen her before.\nShe's amazing. An archer on the city\nwall exclaimed. Yeah, I've never seen\nanything like it either. That fire\ndragon is so long. It's several times\nbigger than the fire dragon summoned by\nBoss Fong Yu. It's simply invincible. At\nthis moment, an archer player with good\nconnections said, \"I heard that Boss\nFong Yu has two very powerful female\nservants. One is a swordsman level\nwarrior who uses an axe and the other is\na mage level mage. I guess this which\nmight be boss Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s servant.\nThat's Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s servant. Her name\nis Valentina. An archer nearby\nexclaimed. Huh? How did you know? The\npeople around asked. The archer replied,\n\"Don't you guys check the chat channel?\nLots of people are cheering her on.\" So\nthey all opened the chat channel. Chin\nXiaoi ID717. Go Valentina. Burn those\nbastards to death. Dong Hao ID 3356.\nAs expected of my goddess, her fighting\npower is simply insane. I love it. Wu\nJingia ID757.\nSo beautiful. So amazing. I love it. Lie\nChong Leang ID88 Fong Yu ID006.\nGodfather, your son is willing to go\nthrough fire and water for you. Could\nyou please give me Valentina's contact\ninformation? Lizakai ID573.\nAlthough Valentina is very strong, I\nstill love Miss Olivia more. Because the\nenemy camp lacked intermediate level\nwater mages without the support of water\nelementals. The three giant fire dragons\nsummoned by Valentina were practically\ninvincible, rampaging wildly through the\nenemy camp. Although Sao Paulo and his\n10 goldeneyed servants released as many\nprotective light shields as possible to\nblock the giant fire dragons attacks,\nthis passive defense was not a long-term\nsolution. Left with no other option, St.\nPaul summoned 10 servants to launch a\nmagical attack on Valentina in midair.\nHowever, for Valentina, who possessed\nteleportation abilities, those low to\nmid-level light magic spells couldn't\neven touch her. Furthermore, while\ncontrolling three fire dragons to attack\nthe enemy forces guarding the light\nshield, she could also summon ground\nspikes to counterattack St. Paul and his\n10 goldeneyed servants inside the light\nshield. Because the light shield can\nonly defend against attacks above the\nground and cannot effectively defend\nagainst attacks from below the ground,\nthree goldeneyed servants were quickly\npierced through the body by sharp earth\nspikes and thrown into the air. Then\nthree pale golden angel phantoms were\nforced to leave their slain bodies and\nretreat backward. Even St. Paul was\nknocked into the air by a sudden spike\ndue to a misstep in positioning.\nFortunately, he had a defensive artifact\non him, so the spike did not cause him\nany effective damage, but it still gave\nthis representative of the god of light\na big fright. After landing, St. Paul\nlooked at the silver-haired witch in\nmidair in disbelief and asked his\ngoldeneyed servant beside him, \"Who is\nthat woman? Why is she so powerful?\" The\ngoldeneyed servant shook his head with a\ngrim expression and said, \"I don't know,\nbut she's at least a powerful mage of at\nleast archage level. And judging by her\nappearance, she's an all elemental mage.\nMaster, we're unlikely to defeat that\nwitch in our current state, I suggest.\"\nSao Paulo cursed under his breath.\na bunch of useless trash. He had finally\norganized a surprise attack to take down\nthe dark gods representative, and he was\nreally unwilling to give up. Now, this\ntime, he brought almost all the combat\ncapable players from his territory along\nwith over 8,000 native humans. To gain\nthe trust of the Allied forces, he\nalways had his players and natives at\nthe forefront. Now, most of these\nplayers and natives have been killed or\nwounded, but he hasn't achieved any of\nhis objectives. How could he be willing\nto retreat like this? But just then, he\ndiscovered another serious problem. A\nlarge number of players have already\nbegun to evacuate from the rear of the\nAllied forces. St. Paul took a closer\nlook and saw that it seemed to be the\nplayer army formations of districts 9\nand 10. So, he immediately opened the\nchat channel and began to question the\nlords of districts 9 and 10 about why\nthey deserted in the face of battle. The\nreply Sao Paulo received was, \"The\nViking Emperor of District 8 has\nlaunched a simultaneous raid on their\nterritory. If they don't go back now,\nthey'll lose their home.\" Upon seeing\nthis information, Sao Paulo knew he had\nno reason to stop them from returning.\nAt the same time, he realized that the\ncoalition he had organized to launch\nthis campaign had probably truly failed.\n\"Damn it, how could we lose like this?\"\nSao Paulo cursed through gritted teeth.\n\"Why did this happen?\" At this moment,\nanother golden robed servant spoke up.\nWe underestimated the power around the\ndark god envoy. He not only has that\npowerful witch servant, but also other\nstrong individuals protecting him. The\nassassin I just sent is also dead. St.\nPaul took a deep breath, suppressing his\nanger, and said, \"Then what should we\ndo? If we withdraw this time, it will be\ndifficult for us to gather so many\ntroops again.\" With King&lt;unk&gt;s Landing\nas his base, it will be difficult for us\nto defeat him head on. A servant in a\ngolden robe suddenly stepped forward,\nbowed to St. Paul, and said, \"Master, I\nhave a way to make this city fall\nwithout a fight.\" \"Oh, you have a\nsolution.\" Sao Paulo raised his eyebrows\nand said, \"Tell me about it.\" The golden\nrobed servant replied, \"I come from the\narchangel Miranda who governs desires\nand can easily arouse the desires of\nmortals.\" \"The desires of mortals?\" St.\nPaul smiled slightly. \"I think I\nunderstand what you mean.\" The golden\nrobed servant smiled mysteriously and\nsaid, \"Master is wise.\" \"So, how do you\nplan to sneak into that city?\" Sao Paulo\nasked curiously. Upon hearing this, the\ngolden robed servant pointed in the\ndirection of King&lt;unk&gt;s Landing and\nsaid, \"It's very simple. I can possess\nany one of them at will.\" \"He he, very\ngood,\" Sa Paulo raised an eyebrow and\nsaid, \"Then go ahead. I'll be waiting\nfor your good news.\" \"As you wish.\" With\nthe golden robe servants advice as a\nhidden move, St. Paul's mood finally\nimproved. Seeing that the siege had\nfailed, he didn't intend to waste any\nmore time and directly issued a notice\nfor the entire army to withdraw in his\nfourth district channel. As for the\nplayers in the other districts, he\ndidn't give them any warnings. He needed\nthose players to drag out the\nsilver-haired witch. At the same time,\nthe more the Allied forces in the other\ndistricts died, the easier it would be\nfor him to carry out his annexation\nplan. Thus, what seemed to be an ongoing\ngreat battle was actually undergoing\nsubtle changes. Players and natives in\nDistrict 4 began to quietly retreat\nwhile Valentina was displaying her\npower. This scene may not have been\nnoticed by the Allied forces who were\ndeeply involved in the battle, but it\nwas seen by Valentina in midair. She\ngave a cold laugh and amplified her\nvoice with magic, saying, \"Oh, the\nspokesperson of the God of Light,\nweren't you going to attack the city?\nWhy did you abandon your allies and run\naway quietly? Upon hearing this, the\nplayers in the other areas, especially\ntheir lords, realized that St. Paul and\nhis seven white robed goldeneyed\nservants had all disappeared from the\nbattle formation without their\nknowledge. Moreover, nearly half of the\npeople in the battle formation were\nmissing. Damn it, we've been betrayed.\nLord George Connor of District 3 cursed\nand immediately began to order everyone\nto retreat. Damn you, St. Paul, you\nshameless bastard. You will pay the\nprice for your betrayal. The other lords\nof the allied forces reacted in the same\nway as the lord of district 3, cursing\nand ordering their troops to retreat.\nThus, the siege that had lasted for half\na day came to an end. Chapter 192.\nCleaning up the battlefield and\nreturning to the manor. Seeing the\nenemies fleeing in disarray, Valentina\ndid not pursue them further as she had\nalso exhausted much of her magic power.\nThis magic power was what she had\npainstakingly accumulated over this\nperiod to restore her physical body. She\nremembered that Fongu had told her to\ntry to restore her physical body within\n2 days. So, after confirming that the\nenemy had indeed withdrawn, Valentina\nbegan to absorb the scattered soul\nenergy on the battlefield. A moment\nlater, she flew back to the city gate\ntower on the city wall, ready to tell\nFongu the good news as soon as possible.\nOf course, before entering the house,\nshe didn't forget to dissipate her\nsurging magic, letting her flowing\nsilver hair fall back down, the\nsix-pointed star inscription on her\nforehead disappear, and transforming\nherself back into the charming female\nghost. In front of your owner, it's best\nto act as submissive and dependent as\npossible. However, as soon as Valentina\nentered the building, she saw Lie Chan\nLong kneeling in front of Fong Yu, head\nbowed and tears streaming down his face\nas he confessed, \"Boss, I was wrong. I\nkilled hundreds of brothers. Kill me.\nLet me atone for my sins to my\nbrothers.\" Fong Yu looked at Lie Chun\nLong, who was pounding his chest and\nsobbing uncontrollably and sighed\nhelplessly, saying, \"Well, King's\nLanding has its own system of rewards\nand punishments. I won't interfere. Go\nfind Song Jimming later and explain the\nsituation to him. Follow the rules. Upon\nhearing this, Liechin Long remained\nsilent for a moment, then got up to go\nfind Song Jimming. Wait a minute. Fong\nYu called out to Liin Long and then\nsaid, \"Let me remind you, you shouldn't\nbe thinking about atoning for your sins\nwith your death, but about how to make\namends. I can give you a chance to make\namends.\" A chance to make amends. Lie\nChin Long was slightly taken aback.\nwiped the tears from his face and asked,\n\"How can I make amends? First, lead the\nmen to clean up the battlefield outside\nthe city, separate our own corpses from\nthe enemy's corpses, and try to keep our\nown corpses intact.\" Upon hearing this,\nLie Chun Long slapped himself hard\nagain, nodded seriously, and said,\n\"Boss, you're right. I'll go right now.\"\nHe then turned to leave. After Lie Chun\nLong left, Fong Yu turned to look at\nValentina, who had just floated in.\nHow's it going outside? Valentina smiled\nslightly and said, \"The enemy has\ncompletely withdrawn.\"\nFunu nodded. In fact, he had already\nheard the cheers of the guards in the\npassageway outside the city wall and had\na general idea of what was going on.\n\"You've worked hard.\" Funu smiled\nslightly at Valentina and said, \"I only\nrealized how strong you are after\nwatching your fight.\" Valentina smiled\nshily and said, \"It's all right. As long\nas you practice diligently, you will\ndefinitely be even better than me in the\nfuture.\" \"Sai, don't praise me. I almost\nlost my life there just now.\" Fongu\nshook his head and said with a rise\nsmile. \"But you're right. I should try\nharder.\" \"By the way, master, could you\ngive me some magic crystals? The battle\njust now consumed a lot of my magic\npower, Valentina said as she returned\nthe all elemental staff to Fong Yu. Now\nthat the battle is over, I'll go back\nand continue cultivating and try to\nrecover my physical body within 2 days.\nUpon hearing this, Fong Yu took the\nstaff and immediately took out 100 magic\ncrystals from his storage ring, asking,\n\"Is that enough? That's enough?\"\nValentina smiled slightly, then used her\nmagic to lift the magic crystals away\nfrom the city gate tower and returned to\nthe city lord's mansion to continue her\ncultivation. Fong Yu, dragging his\naching body, stood up and went to the\ncity wall with Olivia. Meanwhile, the\nnon-combatants in the city were\nbandaging the wounded combatants on the\ncity wall. In addition, many people were\ncarrying the bodies of archers who had\ndied from arrows to the head. Although\nthere were not many, there were still\ndozens of bodies. Funu looked over the\nbattlementss down to the city walls. At\nthat moment, Lie Shinlong was leading a\nlarge group of people, holding torches\nand dealing with the corpses outside the\ncity. The corpses and blood on the\nground were a shocking sight. At a\nglance, at least 2,000 people had died\nin this battle. This is not a light\ntouch in a novel, but a real mountain of\ncorpses and a sea of blood so shocking\nthat it is unbearable to look at. Fongu\ndiscomfort, and asked Olivia beside him,\n\"How are the levels of walkers\nclassified, \"How can I raise my walkers\nlevel?\" He remembered that back at the\nmanor, St. Paul had wiped out his more\nthan a thousand zombies with just one\nskill. Olivia had once said that\nlow-level zombies couldn't withstand\nlight magic. Olivia thought for a moment\nand replied, \"Low-level zombies are\nsoulless walking corpses, and the\nimmortal energy in their bodies is all\ngiven to them by me, just enough to\nmaintain their normal movement and\ncombat.\" Intermediate level zombies are\nendowed with the ability to absorb life\nenergy. They can absorb the life energy\naround them in peace time or in battle\nand convert it into their own immortal\nenergy. With the protection of immortal\nenergy, their combat power and recovery\nability will be greatly improved, and\nthey can use the abundant immortal\nenergy in their bodies to resist the\ndamage of light type spells. At this\npoint, Olivia hesitated for a moment\nbefore slowly saying, \"I can now\nresurrect 1,000 low-level zombies or 300\nmid-level zombies every day.\" Fun\nnodded, then asked, \"What about the\nhighlevel zombies?\" Advanced zombies are\nactually zombies that have been given\nsouls. They have the reactions and\nthinking abilities of normal people and\nthey can also improve themselves.\nHowever, with my current abilities, I am\nnot yet capable of creating advanced\nzombies. When Fongu heard Olivia talk\nabout her abilities, he suddenly\nrealized something. Tina, resurrecting\nwalkers requires your immortal energy,\nso won't that affect the speed at which\nyour strength recovers? Olivia nodded\nand said, \"It will definitely have an\nimpact.\" \"No wonder,\" Funu exclaimed.\n\"It was my oversight. Is there any way\nto help you speed up your recovery?\"\n\"There is only one. What? Death and\nslaughter.\" Olivia smiled slightly and\nsaid, \"Actually, overall, my strength\nhas been slowly recovering recently.\nAfter all, I have participated in\nseveral battles, big and small, by your\nside recently. Especially today's\nbattle. I was able to obtain a lot of\ndeath power from it. Not only me,\nValentina should also be able to absorb\na lot of soul power. Fun nodded. He\nbegan to think about where there was a\nsuitable place to kill. His first\nthought was the neighboring district 5,\nbut the players in district 5 were\nactually Fong use future resources, so\ndoing so would be a loss. Moreover, if\nhe were to do that, he would truly\nbecome a demon king. Therefore, even if\nthey really wanted to kill, they could\nonly target hostile creatures of other\nraces. That leaves only one other place,\nthe underground palace in the\nunderworld. There should be thousands of\ncave dwarves inside. Fongu wouldn't have\nany psychological burden in killing\nthem, and he could also obtain the\ntreasures in the dungeon, killing two\nbirds with one stone. But the key is the\nTitan cat in the dungeon. Do you think\nthe four of us with our current strength\ncan defeat that Titan cat? After a\nmoment of silence, Olivia said, \"It's\nvery dangerous to fight headon, but it's\npossible if we use some tactics.\"\nTactics? Fongu raised an eyebrow. Olivia\nsmiled slightly and said, \"Have you\nforgotten that you previously asked\nValentina to concoct a poison for you to\nuse to kill the dragon?\" Fong Yu slapped\nhis thigh and exclaimed in surprise, \"Oh\nmy god, I almost forgot about that\nthing.\" An hour later, Fong Yu, whose\ninjuries had mostly healed, brought\nOlivia and Alpha to the open space\noutside the city. By then, Liechin Long\nhad already led his men to sort through\nthe corpses outside the city. He placed\nthe bodies of his own men near the city\ngate, while the bodies of the enemy were\npiled up into three mounts. At this\nmoment, Lu X Yao Fang, who is in charge\nof counting the casualties, walked up to\nFong Yu and said with a sorrowful\nexpression, \"Brother Fong Yu, the number\nof casualties has been counted. How\nmany?\" 355 people were slightly injured,\n113 were seriously injured, and 289\ndied. Fongu glanced at the corpses lined\nup by the city gate, frowned, and asked,\n\"How many are there?\" 225 people. Lu\nXiaoa Fang bit her lip, glanced at Li\nChun Long kneeling before the row of\ncorpses, head bowed in repentance,\nhesitated for a moment, then said to\nFong Yu, \"Brother, I know this was Lie\nChunl&lt;unk&gt;s command mistake, but he was\njust in a hurry. It wasn't intentional.\nCould you?\" Fong Yu turned to look at Lu\nXiaoang, and the indifferent look in his\neyes made Lu Xiao Fang swallow back what\nshe was about to say. Everyone must take\nresponsibility for the mistakes they\nmake, Fongu said calmly. As the\nadministrator and law enforcer of this\ncity, what you should do is not plead\nwith me, but make a judgment according\nto the rules and regulations you have\nestablished. Although Fong Yu did not\nreprimand him, the meaning behind his\nwords was already quite clear. Lu\nXiaoang sighed helplessly and nodded.\nBut Fong Yu added, \"However, considering\nhow earnestly he repented, he should be\npunished accordingly. But we can also\ngive him a chance to make amends.\"\nAlthough Fong Yu hoped that all\nprocedures would be fair and just, these\nwere extraordinary times, a time when\nmanpower was in high demand, and Lie\nChunlong was currently the only other\nforce capable of fighting in King's\nLanding besides him. So, he ultimately\nmade concessions. After everyone had\nleft, Fong Yu then had Olivia come to\nthe corpses of the enemy soldiers and\nbegin to revive the zombies. There is no\nspecific count of the enemy's deaths,\nbut the number is roughly around 2,200,\nexcluding those whose bodies were burned\nbeyond resurrection by fire magic. There\nare about 2,000 remaining resurrectable\ncorpses. Fong Yu then instructed Olivia\nto resurrect the zombies while he\nreturned to the city to retrieve the\nmagic crystal and the book of the evil\ngod where Valentina was hiding and took\nSakura and the puppet with him as he\nleft the city. By the time Fongu left\nthe city, Olivia had already resurrected\n1,000 zombies. Then she had these 1,000\nzombies carry the remaining 1,000\ncorpses, and the group returned to the\nmanor. This sudden war finally ended\nwith minimal losses. Chapter 193,\nSpatial Law Crystal: Evolution of the\nDemon Lord. Upon returning to the manor,\nFunu immediately saw the wooden house\nburned to the ground, leaving only\nruins. In addition, the crops in the\nfields had been completely wiped out by\nthe enemy. However, these problems are\nnot major. The wooden house can be\nrepaired and the farmland can be\nreplanted. Most importantly, the monster\nhouse was not damaged too much. After\nall, the spider remains had been\npetrified and could not be burned by\nflames. At that time, the enemy troops\nwere chasing Fong Yu, who was fleeing to\nKing's Landing, so they probably did not\nhave time to demolish the monster house.\nAs for the cemetery, it was not damaged.\nIt is likely that Sao Paulo was unaware\nof the purpose of the cemetery, and\nordinary soldiers would certainly not\nhave targeted a cemetery. Fortunately,\nthe two most important buildings were\nnot damaged. Suddenly, a thick purplish\nblack tentacle emerged from the ground\nwith a purple eyeball at its tip, which\nblinked at Fong Yu. He, \"You You're\nhere, too. That's good.\" The demonic\nvine nodded, then looked behind Fong Yu,\nits mouth parts tipped with sharp teeth\nslowly opening. Fongu seemed to sense\nwhat the demon vine was thinking, so he\nasked, \"What do you want?\" Then the\ndemonic vine extended a second tentacle\nfrom the ground and pointed at the\ncorpses carried by the zombies behind\nit. \"You want those corpses?\" Funu asked\nknowingly. The magic vine nodded. At\nthis point, the game assistant Lu gave a\nprompt. The demonic tentacle vine has\ncurrently devoured 925 corpses. After\ndevouring another 75 corpses, it will\nevolve into the demonic tentacle lord.\nUpon seeing the prompt, Funu immediately\nunderstood. He then instructed Olivia to\nhave the zombies throw 75 corpses on the\nground. The magic vines then happily\nextended 75 tentacles, dragging all the\ncorpses underground. Immediately\nafterward, the ground shook as if\nsomething was churning underground. A\nmoment later, a giant tentacle with a\ndiameter of over 2 m suddenly shot up\nfrom the ground in front of Fong Yu.\nFongu looked up and saw that this thing\nwas an astonishing 20 m long. It looked\nlike a sharp spike piercing the starry\nsky. Immediately afterwards, the\nenormous tentacle began to shrink\nrapidly, recede, and finally condense\ninto a giant fleshy ball with a diameter\nof over 5 m. The surface of the fleshy\nball was covered with tendons like blood\nvessels, making it look ferocious and\nterrifying, and it was also rhythmically\nexpanding and contracting. The demonic\ntentacle vine is evolving and\ntransforming. Time required 59 minutes\nand 58 seconds. Not only was Fongu\nstartled by the giant tumor in front of\nhim, but Olivia also stared in surprise.\nAlpha, on the other hand, seemed very\ncalm. He even leaned over to sniff it\nand then barked twice at Fongu. Fongu\nraised an eyebrow and asked Olivia,\n\"What does it mean?\" It said it had seen\nthis thing in the abyss of the demon\nrealm. Woof! Woof! Woof! Woof! woof. It\nalso said that the demon vine master\nevolved from an ordinary demon blood\nvine is already close to the strength of\na dragon, while the monster evolved from\nthis demon touch vine corrupted by the\nevil god. Maybe even more powerful than\na dragon. Upon hearing this, Fongu\nimmediately perked up. More powerful\nthan a dragon. Wouldn't that mean I'd be\ntaking off? But as long as he thought\nabout it, Fongu didn't know what the\nfinal product would be. He decided to\nwait an hour and see. Fong Yu then\narrived at the charred remains of the\nwooden house and activated the house\nupgrade system. The main wooden house in\nGhost Manor has been destroyed by fire.\nIts current durability is 0/1,000\nmaking it unusable and requiring repair.\nRepair requirements wood 0/10,000\ngravel 0/4000\nmud 0/1600\nrot 10/1600\niron ingot 99.999/500\ncannot be repaired. Upon seeing the\namount of materials needed for the\nrepair, Fongu suddenly realized a\nproblem. All the building materials he\nhad stored in the cellar were gone,\nleaving only a set of iron ingots in his\nbackpack. It must have been looted by\nthe Allied forces in Sao Paulo. Damn it.\nFong Yu was seething with hatred at this\nmoment. That was nearly 500,000 worth of\nsupplies. My heart is bleeding. But what\ncan we do? It's gone now. Fortunately,\nhe gained nearly 3,000 honor points in\nthis battle. Enough for him to do 300\nmore 10 pulls on the lottery wheel. So,\noverall, it wasn't a bad deal. However,\nthat tentacle monster roulette went back\nto restock. and I don't know if the\ngoods have been brought back yet. Forget\nit. I'll think about the lottery after\nthe house is repaired. Fong Yu then used\niron ingots to exchange for the\nnecessary materials for repairs at the\nexchange and repaired the wooden house.\nIn the blink of an eye, the dilapitated\nwooden house completely collapsed. All\nthe ashes and debris were absorbed and\ndisappeared by a strange spatial\nfluctuation. Then, pieces of wood and\npieces of rubble began to be\nautomatically piled up. Perhaps because\nthe amount of work involved in this\nrepair was a bit large. It took a full 5\nminutes for the wooden house to be\nrepaired. Funu pushed open the door and\nwent inside. The tables, chairs,\ncabinets, fireplace, and chandelier were\nexactly the same as before, except for\nsome minor decorative items. So, Fongu\nwent into his bedroom for a look. Sure\nenough, all that was left inside was a\nwooden bed and a wardrobe. The\nfour-piece bedding set on the bed and\nthe few changes of clothes in the\nwardrobe were gone. Of course, these are\nminor issues. He has stored the\nimportant supplies in his storage ring.\nAnd as long as he has the lottery\nroulette and the book of evil god, he\ncan still obtain new supplies. So, you\nbought all the daily necessities\ndirectly from the exchange, a total of\nthree sets. He prepared one set for\nhimself, Olivia, and Valentina's rooms,\nand also rebuilt a comfortable dog house\nfor Alpha. After finishing all that,\nFong Yu took out the Book of Evil Gods.\nHe had been too busy these past two days\nand forgot to feed it. He was hungry\nnow, so he decided to get some late\nnight snacks and feed the guy while he\nwas at it to see if it could produce\nanything good. The late night snack was\nrather simple. Fong Yu, whose body achd\nall over, was too lazy to cook any more\nfood. He simply roasted a few pieces of\nmeat in the fireplace and ate with Alpha\nand Olivia. He then used the leftover\nroasted meat to feed the book of evil\ngods. This guy is much more obedient now\nthan when he first arrived. After all,\nbeing hammered by the incredibly strong\nOlivia is no pleasant experience. So,\nafter the restrictions on the cover were\nlifted, this guy didn't dare to move\naround and obediently waited for Fongu\nto feed him. Let me tell you, I'm not in\na good mood today. You'd better give me\nsomething useful or I'll get really\nangry and the consequences will be\nsevere. Fong Yu threatened the book of\nevil gods insincerely. However, the book\nof evil gods didn't seem to care. The\neyeball on the cover even rolled its\neyes at Fong Yu and stuck out its\ntongue. So, Olivia put down the barbecue\nshe was holding and rolled up her\nsleeves. Upon seeing Olivia's posture,\nthe book of evil god was so frightened\nthat it retracted its tongue, mumbled\nsomething for a long time, and then\nopened its mouth again, presenting a\ntransparent crystal to Fong Yu with its\npurple tongue. Fongu raised an eyebrow\nand accepted the walnut-sized crystal.\nSpatial law crystal, purple grade, an\nextremely rare item, a crystal that can\nonly be born in other dimensions. After\nabsorbing the spatial law power within\nit, it can generate an independent space\nbound to the soul with a size of\n1/10enth of the magic power value per\ncubic meter. After absorbing the laws of\nspace, you can unlock space-based magic,\nbut you'll need to acquire the specific\nmagic skills yourself. Of course, if\nyou're exceptionally talented, you can\nresearch and create your own magic, but\nthere's a possibility of being\npermanently exiled to another dimension.\nAfter reading the introduction to the\ngame assistant, Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s eyes\nwidened in surprise and he burst into\nlaughter. Not only will you gain an\nextra independent storage space, but\nthis storage space can also be upgraded\nas your magic power increases. More\nimportantly, he can use this to unlock\nspatial magic. He had previously heard\nValentina mention spatial magic, an\nextremely rare type of magic.\nHistorically, only a handful of people\nare known to have become spatial mages,\nbut all of them were legendary arch\nmages. Fonu had been envious of that for\na long time. Moreover, he had just\nwitnessed Valentina using spatial magic\nto teleport and completely outmaneuver\nmore than 20 enemy mages today. Now,\nthat's great. With this spatial law\ncrystal, I can also become a spatial\nmage. Very good. Fong Yu glanced at the\nbook of evil gods on the table and said,\n\"I'll get you a whole roasted pig\ntomorrow.\" Seeing Fong Yu so happy,\nOlivia asked him curiously what it was.\nFong Yu explained it to her and Olivia\nwas very surprised after hearing it. I\nnever expected you to vomit something so\ngood. Olivia smiled and said,\n\"Congratulations, master.\" He he keep it\nlow-key. Just then, a cracking sound\nsuddenly came from outside. Fong Yu\nchecked the time and guessed that the\ndemonic vine had finished evolving. So,\nhe went outside. Sure enough, as soon as\nFong Yu stepped outside, he saw that the\nhuge ball of flesh had cracked open, and\na humanoid monster more than 4 m tall\nwas slowly standing up from inside the\nball of flesh. As it stood up, the\ncracked ball of flesh also collapsed\nrapidly and quickly merged into the\nhumanoid monster's legs. Immediately,\nthe humanoid monster turned its head to\nlook at Fong Yu. Then at itself, its\ntall body began to shrink rapidly,\neventually becoming a human slightly\nshorter than Fongu. Then the churning\npurplish black tentacles on its body\nsurface began to change rapidly, quickly\nturning into white skin like that of a\nnormal human. However, the monster\ndidn't seem very satisfied and began to\nadjust its body shape again. After\nglancing at Fong Yu, it tilted its head\nand thought for a moment. Then its chest\nbegan to slowly swell, its waist began\nto slowly thin, and its legs began to\nslowly lengthen. Finally, a thick head\nof long purple hair emerged from the top\nof its head and automatically tied into\na ponytail that fell down its back.\nFinally, its face appeared, and after a\nseries of wriggling movements, its eyes,\nnose, mouth, and ears slowly emerged.\nSoon enough, a voluuptuous purple-haired\nwoman stood before Fong Yu O. With a\nstrange sound, the purple-haired woman\nfinally adjusted her voice to be\nextremely sweet, gentle, and melodious,\nand smiled slightly at Fong Yu. Say,\n\"Master, how is it? Do you like it?\"\nFong Yu. Chapter 194. Parasitic Seed.\nAre you the demon vine? Fongu swallowed\nhard, asking somewhat nervously. That's\nright, master. But I should be called\nthe lord of touch demons now or you can\ngive me a new name. The naked demon vine\nsmiled at Fongu. Perhaps because it was\nthe first time she had smiled. Her smile\nlooked somewhat stiff and eerie. Do you\nlike me like this? This? Fongu glanced\nawkwardly at Olivia beside him and\nstammered. Why do I want to become a\nwoman? At this moment, Olivia snorted\nand turned to walk into the wooden\nhouse. Upon hearing this, Emo Tong was\nslightly taken aback and blurted out,\n\"Do you like men?\" As he spoke, another\nlayer of tiny purple tentacles surged up\nfrom the demon vine's skin. In just two\nbreaths, the demon vine's body became\nmuch more robust, and soon a\npurple-haired man with a near-perfect\nmuscle ratio appeared in front of Fong\nYu. How about this? Do you like it? If\nyou still don't like it, I can transform\ninto anything you like. Not just humans,\nbut other creatures, too. Fong Yu. Fong\nYu sighed helplessly and said, \"No\nmatter what you turn into, can you at\nleast conjure up another set of clothes?\nBeing naked is very indecent.\" Upon\nhearing this, the demon vine nodded, and\ncountless tiny tentacles quickly emerged\nfrom its body, intertwining, condensing,\nand transforming into a set of assault\nsuits exactly like the one Fong Yu was\nwearing, even down to the parts of the\nsuit that were scorched and deformed by\nflames. Seeing this, Fong Yu realized\nsomething and asked, \"You can transform\ninto anything?\" The demon vine nodded\nand replied, \"Any creature I have\ndevoured can be transformed into its\nappearance 100%. If it is a creature I\nhave only seen, it can also be\ntransformed into the same form as it. Is\nit limited to living things? Plants,\neven statues, houses, and rocks are all\nfine,\" the demon vine said with another\nstiff smile. \"As long as they're not too\nbig, it's okay. For larger objects, I'll\nhave to devour more things later.\" I\nsee. Fong you couldn't help but exclaim\nin admiration, \"Your ability is truly\nremarkable.\" After transforming, \"Will\nyou be able to acquire their abilities?\"\nAfter thinking for a moment, the demon\nvine replied, \"If it's an ability they\npossess themselves, then I can basically\ncopy it. But if it's an ability that\nrelies on treasures or divine power,\nthen I can't copy it. I understand. Do\nyou have any other abilities?\" Upon\nhearing this, the demon vine nodded and\nuttered a soft cry, \"Thorns!\"\nImmediately, Fong Yu saw countless tiny\ntentacles emerge from the feet of the\ndemonic vine and enter the soil. A few\nseconds later, dozens of long, sharp\ntentacles suddenly pierced out of the\nopen space, not far away. Not only that,\nthose tentacles were also covered with\ncone-shaped thorns, and then they began\nto wave around. The magic vine\nexplained, \"This skill can be released\nwithin 200 m. It can be a few vines or\nhundreds, depending on the need. Is\nthere anything else?\" A parasitic seed.\nThe demonic vine stretched out its hand,\nand a purple particle the size of a\nsesame seed appeared in its palm. The\ndemon vine explained, \"This seed will\nparasetize any flesh it comes into\ncontact with. It can devour a large\namount of the host's flesh and blood and\nkill the host in a few breaths and then\ncontrol the host's body to fight.\nHowever, it can only parasetize some not\nvery strong creatures. If it is a\ncreature of the dragon level, the\nparasitic seed will be destroyed by the\npowerful energy in their body and will\nnot be able to parasitize it. Fongu\nnaturally didn't expect anything from\ndragons since according to the system,\nthe lord of demonic touch was only at\nthe same level as dragons. both being\nepic level. At this moment, the demon\nvine smiled eerily and said, \"Although\nit cannot parasetize a dragon in its\nprime, it can try if it is a severely\ninjured, dying, or recently deceased\ndragon.\" Upon hearing this, Fong\nYu&lt;unk&gt;s eyes lit up. He pointed to the\ncorpses that the zombies had brought\nback outside the manor and asked, \"Can\nthese corpses be parasetized?\" The magic\nvine nodded and said, \"Okay, those 900\nplus corpses could all be parasetized.\"\nEmo tongue smiled slightly and said,\n\"Not only those 900 plus corpses, but\neven these walking corpses are fine.\"\nAfter saying that, the demon vine\nstretched its hands toward the sky, and\ncountless tentacles spread out from its\n10 fingers, intertwining together and\nquickly weaving a fleshy tumor more than\n1 meter in size, resembling a flower\nbutt. Just as Fong Yu was wondering what\nthe demon vine was doing, the fleshy\ntumor suddenly exploded and then a thick\nblack fog drifted toward the walking\ncorpses outside the manor. Upon closer\ninspection, the thick fog was actually\ncomposed of thousands upon thousands of\npurplish black seeds that were flying\nautonomously under the control of the\ndemonic vine. This black fog made up of\nparasitic seeds quickly drifted into the\nhorde of zombies and the corpses on the\nground. Soon, the zombies began to\ntremble strangely, and even the corpses\non the ground began to shake. At that\nmoment, Olivia burst out of the cabin\nand cried out to Fong Yu, \"Master, the\nzombie core has been attacked.\" Fongu\nwaved his hand and said, \"Don't panic.\nIt's a demonic vine.\" Upon hearing this,\nOlivia turned to look at the magic vine\nbeside her, her brows furrowing. \"How\ncome you've turned into a man again? I\ndon't have a fixed gender like you\nhumans. I can reproduce on my own, the\ndemon vine replied. Therefore, I can\nchange my gender at will. At this\nmoment, the flesh and blood of the\nzombies and corpses outside the manor\nwere being rapidly consumed by the\nparasitic seed. Soon, the zombies were\ncovered in full purplish black armor\nwith sharp barbs growing all over their\nbodies. The corpses were also covered in\npurple full armor except that a huge\npurple eyeball was still rolling on\ntheir chests. I won't interfere with the\nmind of the zombies. You can still\ncommand them. The parasitic seed is like\na full suit of armor for them. The magic\nvine said to Olivia, \"As for the\ncorpses, I'll command them.\" Olivia\nturned to look at Fong Yu, who nodded\nand said, \"That's fine, Olivia. You also\nneed to accumulate energy to recover\nyour strength. If you keep reviving\ncorpses, your strength won't improve.\nLet the demon vine parasetize the\ncorpses that appear later. At this\nmoment, Emot laughed and said, \"Yes, our\nenemies are the representatives of the\ngod of light. Their light magic has a\nstrong restraining effect on zombies,\nbut it cannot restrain me and my\nparasitic servants.\" There's this\nbenefit, too. Fa was delighted to hear\nthat. Yes. The demon vine nodded and\nsaid, \"My true form is a plant. Light\nmagic not only cannot restrain me, but\nsome light magic can even be absorbed by\nme and my parasitic servants. I remember\nyou were corrupted by the ancient gods,\nweren't you? Doesn't light magic\ncounteract that?\" Funu asked again. The\ndemon vine shook its head and said, \"No,\nthe ancient gods attribute is chaotic\nand it is not restrained by any magical\nability. Only power that reaches the\nlevel of the world's fundamental laws\ncan restrain the ancient gods attribute.\nWhat's the meaning? Only attributes at\nthe level of gods or above can restrain\nthe power of ancient gods. I see. At\nthis moment, Fongu suddenly thought of\nsomething and asked, \"I remember you\nweren't born that long ago, were you?\nHow do you know so many things?\" Emot\nsmiled slightly and said, \"You said it\nyourself. I was corrupted by the power\nof the ancient gods. Actually, I prefer\nto use the word baptism. The ancient\ngods are the most ancient and primitive\ngroup of gods, even older than the gods\nof light and darkness. They have the\ndeepest understanding of this world and\nthe most extensive knowledge. Every\nbeing who has been baptized by the\nancient gods can not only obtain\npowerful strength from them, but also\nendless knowledge. At this point, Emot\nlooked at Fong Yu and smiled slightly,\nsaying, \"I suggest that you also try to\nreceive the baptism of the ancient gods\nif you have the chance.\" Fongu raised an\neyebrow slightly upon hearing this. He\nrecalled the legends about evil gods,\nhow ancient gods would use various means\nto bewitch and corrupt those who came\nnear them. So, he quickly refused,\nsaying, \"He, never mind. Let's&lt;unk&gt; not\nconsider those for now.\" Thinking of\nthis, Fong Yu couldn't help but start to\nworry about the loyalty of the demon\nvine. Will this powerful servant one day\nbetray him under the influence of an\nevil god? Fortunately, the game\nassistant provided an answer\nimmediately. The legends about evil gods\nthat you know are merely the fantasies\nof mortals in your world. Whether they\nare ancient gods, evil gods, or other\ndeities, they cannot be easily defined\nas good or evil, right or wrong. Here's\na piece of advice. Any power is merely a\ntool to help you achieve your desires.\nTools themselves are neither good nor\nevil. Any power that can be used to your\nadvantage is good for you. As for what\nyour desires are, only you can define\nthat. Chapter 195. Returning to the\nunderground palace. The game assistance\nwords made fun. You fall into deep\nthought. Indeed, any power that can be\nused for one's own benefit is good. So\nthere is no need to judge the ancient\ngods with prejudice based on hearsay.\nJust like the god of light and the god\nof darkness. If you didn't know about\nthe bet or the truth behind the survival\ngame, he might have also relied on his\nown preconceived notions to believe that\nthe god of light was righteous and the\ngod of darkness was evil. But that's not\nthe case. The god of light wants to\neliminate all living beings in this\nworld and reset it. So to the living\nbeings in this world, it is evil. The\ngod of darkness risking his own demise\nmade this wager with the god of light\nhoping to secure a glimmer of hope for\nall living beings in the world.\nTherefore, it was righteous for all\nliving beings in the world. So, in the\nend, it still comes true. As the old\nsaying goes, there is no absolute right\nor wrong in this world, only different\nperspectives. After figuring this out,\nFong Yu no longer feared or rejected the\npower of the demon vine, or rather the\npower of the ancient god. At least from\nhis own perspective, he has already\nobtained many good things from the\nlottery wheel and the treasures that the\nlottery will brings him are basically\nrelated to the ancient gods. From this\npoint of view, the ancient gods are\nbeneficial to him. And it can even be\nsaid that they are blatantly helping\nhim. Although Fong Yu didn't know the\nancient god's purpose in helping him, he\nfigured he might as well take advantage\nof the benefits that were being handed\nto him. Even if the ancient god has some\nother purpose, let's wait until its true\ncolors are revealed. The most urgent\ntask right now is to improve our own\nstrength as soon as possible. In that\ncase, it's settled. Funu said to Olivia,\n\"Olivia, you'll come with me to the\nunderground palace later. The demon vine\nand its servants will be the main\nattackers, and you'll be responsible for\nabsorbing the power of death. Try to\nimprove your strength as soon as\npossible. The underground palace. Olivia\nwas slightly taken aback and asked, \"Are\nwe going there in a bit?\" Fongu nodded\nand said, \"We don't have much time left.\nAfter midnight, we only have one day to\nprepare in the Lord&lt;unk&gt;'s tournament\nthe day after tomorrow. We will\nencounter the spokesperson of the god of\nlight and his servants again. Therefore,\nwe must improve our strength as much as\npossible within a single day. A moment\nlater, with everything ready, Fongu led\nthe newly joined demon lord, Demon Vine,\nOlivia, Alpha, and more than 1,900\nzombies modified by the parasitic seed\nto the mine. Tonight's goal is to wipe\nout that nest of cave dwarves in the\ndungeon. Fongu was still hesitant\nbecause Valentina needed to go into\nseclusion to break through her limits\nand it would be difficult for him. Alpha\nOlivia and the other two to defeat the\nTitan cat. Now that the demon lord, who\nis also of epic level, has joined the\nteam, Fongu feels that this operation\nshould be a sure thing. When Fong Yu\nentered the mine, he was surprised to\nsee several corpses. Judging from their\nwhite skin, it was likely that some of\nthe players from zone 5 who had ambushed\nhim had wandered into this place by\nmistake and been killed by the ghosts in\nthe mine. Soon, ghost Steve floated out\nof the mine cabin. Oh, Master Fong Yu,\nlong time no see. After greeting Fong\nYu, Steve noticed the densely packed\narmy of zombies following behind him and\nwas slightly taken aback. He asked,\n\"What's going on here?\" Fong Yu smiled\nslightly and said, \"I'm going to the\nunderworld tonight to wipe out that den\nof dwarves and avenge you. Of course,\nyou should choose the most pleasant\nsounding words to say.\" Sure enough.\nGhost Steve's face lit up with a\ndelighted smile upon hearing this. And\nhe laughed loudly. Haha, that's\nfantastic. We've been waiting for this\nday for far too long. I'm going to tell\nBob and the others this good news. After\nsaying that, Steve rushed into the mine.\nFong Yu smiled slightly and led the\ntroops behind him into the mine. As\nexpected, 10 ghosts joined Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s\ngroup. And when Fong Yu passed by the\nrat king&lt;unk&gt;s cave, the guy actually\nwanted to get involved, too. Thus, a\nforce composed of mutated zombies,\nghosts, and swarms of rock rats quickly\narrived at the mysterious underground\npalace via the underground passage. Fonu\noriginally planned to lure out a group\nof dwarf demons from the rat hole in the\ncorner of the underground palace first,\nbut Immot said it was unnecessary and a\nwaste of time and that they should just\ncharge indirectly. At this moment, Fongu\nremembered the underground palace key he\nhad obtained from the rat king&lt;unk&gt;'s\nden. So, he took the key and went to the\nfront of the huge underground palace\ngate, which was nearly 50 m high, and\nprepared to use the key to open the\ndoor. However, he was stunned when he\nsaw that there was no keyhole on the\ndoor. \"Is this key not for this door?\"\nFong Yu asked somewhat surprised.\nOlivia, who was standing nearby, said,\n\"I don't think so.\" \"Why are you so\nsure?\" Fongu asked curiously. \"Maybe the\nkeyhole is hidden behind some kind of\nmechanism.\" Olivia replied casually.\n\"Have you ever seen a 50 m high door\nwith such a small key?\" Fongu glanced at\nthe foot long golden key in his hand and\nfell silent. Indeed, although a foot in\nlength is not small, it seems\ndisproportionate to the 50 m high gate.\nThis key should be the key to open a\ndoor or a treasure chest in the\ndungeon,\" Olivia continued. \"Well,\nthere's no other way then. Let's just go\nthrough the mouse hole.\" So, the group\narrived at the rat hole leading to the\ntreasure vault again. Fong Yu originally\nthought of luring out a group of cave\ndwarves to kill them just like last\ntime, but Immot said it was unnecessary\nand would be a waste of time. So Fong Yu\ntold Imo Tong about the Titan cat. It\nsaid that cat is as powerful as a\ndragon, so we should be careful. Fong Yu\nwarned. Upon hearing this, the demon\nvine nodded. After all, it had only\nrecently evolved into the lord of touch\ndemons, and its strength had not yet\nreached its peak. On the other hand, the\nTitan giant cat had been living for an\nunknown amount of time. If a fight were\nto break out, anything could happen. So,\nthe demon vine came up with a plan. It\ncondensed another fleshy ball filled\nwith parasitic seeds in front of the rat\nhole. When the fleshy ball broke, it\ncontrolled the black mist formed by the\nparasitic seeds to fly into the rat\nhole. A moment later, the screams of\nmany dwarf demons came from the rat\nhole, followed by the meow of a cat,\nfilled with shock and anger. After a\nwhile, Emo Tong turned to Fong Yu and\nsmiled slightly. All right, this place\nhas been cleared for now. That giant cat\nseems to be very timid. It ran away as\nsoon as it touched my parasitic seed. It\nmust have hidden deep in the underground\npalace. So, we can go in now. The magic\nvine nodded. So, just to be on the safe\nside, Fong Yu had Olivia and Mo Tong\nlead the 2,000 mutated zombies into the\nrat hole first. Only after the 2,000\nzombies had completely taken over the\nentire treasure vault did Fong Yu and a\nfew companions enter. The rat king and\nits swarm of rats followed last. Upon\nentering the treasure vault, according\nto the feedback from the magic vine,\nthere were only a dozen or so dwarf\ndemons inside, all of whom had been\nkilled by the parasitic seeds and\ntransformed into mutated dwarf demons.\nThe remaining parasitic seeds had\ndrifted along the passage into the\ndepths of the underground palace and\nwere slaughtering the dwarf demons\nhiding there. Hiss Fongu felt a chill\nrun down his spine after hearing this.\nHe really didn't expect the demon vine\nto be so powerful. With just one move,\nthe parasitic seed, it made the\nthousands of dwarf demons hiding in the\nunderground palace obediently wait to\ndie. If there's another large-scale\nenemy force like before, \"You can just\nscatter a parasitic seed and it'll all\nbe over, right?\" Funu asked excitedly.\nDemon Vine shook his head and said, \"The\nparasitic seeds are actually very\nfragile. They are afraid of fire. A\nsingle ordinary flame can burn all of\nthem to death. If the enemy camp has a\nlarge defensive formation, my parasitic\nseeds will have a hard time penetrating\nit. They are only effective against\nthese simple-minded dwarves who don't\nknow magic. Upon hearing this, Fongu\nunderstood. Indeed, if such a powerful\nskill had no weaknesses, the Demon Vine\nclan would have dominated the world long\nago. What Fong you didn't know was that\nthe demon vines territory was limited in\nthe abyss of hell because of the\nenvironment. The abyss of hell was full\nof volcanoes and lava pools and most of\nthe demon creatures abilities were fire\nrelated. So the parasitic seed could not\nspread widely. But once in this world,\nthe demon vine can rapidly expand\nthrough its parasitic seeds if it so\ndesires because there are no terrain\nlimitations and few natural enemies.\nEmot felt that after this underground\npalace journey was over, it would be\nnecessary to tell Fong Yu all its\nabilities so that he could unify the\nworld as soon as possible. After all,\nthis was a task given to it by the great\nevil god. Chapter 196. The true treasure\nof the underground palace. It would be\nimpossible for Fong Yu not to be tempted\nby the treasures in the vault. However,\nhis storage ring already contained many\nthings, and these dazzling treasures\nwere obviously not stackable. It would\nprobably be full after only a few items.\nSo, after thinking it over, Fong Yu\ndecided to have the rat king arrange for\nthe rats to move the treasures from the\nvault to its lair. So, the rat king\nbegan directing the rats to move the\ntreasure, while Fong Yu along with Emo\nTong, Olivia, Alpha, and 10 ghosts\ncontinued toward the treasure vault's\nentrance. The purpose of this trip is\nthree-fold. One is to obtain the\ntreasures within the underground palace.\nAlthough the treasure vault contains a\ngreat many treasures, Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s\nintuition tells him that the gold,\nsilver, and crystal ores are not the\ntrue treasures of this underground\npalace. There must be other treasures\nhidden within. The second objective is\nto find the Titan cat and ideally to\ntame it. If taming it is not possible,\nthen kill it and see if we can resurrect\nit as an undead. If I could bring the\nTitan cat under my command, it would be\nlike having two more epic minions at\nonce. In that case, Fongu would be much\nmore confident facing the Lord's\ntournament in 2 days. The final\nobjective was to kill all the dwarves in\nthe dungeon, allowing Olivia to absorb\ntheir life force, Alpha to absorb their\ndemonic blood, and incidentally to help\nthe ghosts avenge themselves. The group\nquickly passed through Treasure Mountain\nand arrived at the gate of the treasure\nvault. The gate was still extremely\ntall, about 30 m high. At this moment,\nthe gate was opened a crack, which was\nabout 2 m wide. Fongu looked up at the\nmassive stone gate and finally asked the\nquestion that had been lingering in his\nmind for a long time. I remember the\nowner of this underground palace was a\nTitan. Were all Titans giants? Olivia\nshook her head and said, \"I've never\nseen a titan, so I don't know.\" At this\nmoment, Emo Tong said, \"The Titans are\nindeed giants over 20 meters tall. They\nwere among the first to arrive in this\nworld, and they defeated the original\ngods and tribes of this world,\nultimately shaping it into what it is\ntoday. And then, because they created\ntoo many lives without permission, they\nwere taken back to the divine realm by\nthe god of light.\" Funu asked. The demon\nvine nodded, then shook its head and\nsaid, \"I don't know the specifics\neither. The knowledge the ancient god\ngave me doesn't include this\ninformation.\" Fongu nodded and said\nnothing more. The group then walked out\nof the treasure vault. After exiting the\nbuilding, Fongu found himself in a vast\nhall. He released a fire dragon that\nsoared into the sky, but even in the\nfire light, he couldn't see the boundary\nof the hall. However, he did see many\ndead dwarfs lying on the ground. The\ndwarves now had purplish black tentacles\ngrowing from their bodies, indicating\nthat they had been parasetized by the\nparasitic seeds of the demonic vines.\nSoon, summoned by the magic vine, all\nthe parasetized dwarf demons around them\ngot up from the ground and began to\ngather towards Fong Yu and his group.\nSo, Olivia and Alpha began to move among\nthe dwarfs. Olivia absorbed the life\nforce emanating from the dead dwarfs\nwhile Alpha bit into each dwarf to\nextract their demonic blood. As for Fong\nYu and Emo Tong, they remained vigilant,\nconstantly alert to their surroundings\nto prevent a sudden attack from the\nTitan cat. However, even after Olivia\nand Alpha had absorbed the power of all\nthe more than a thousand dwarfs, the\nTitan cat still hadn't appeared. This\nFong Yu asked with some doubt. That guy\nisn't hiding somewhere and too scared to\ncome out. Is he? He remembered what the\ngame assistant had said when introducing\nthe Titan cat. That the cat was timid by\nnature and the reason it dared to show\nitself last time was because there were\nfew of them and the strongest one was\nonly Alpha. But now he is surrounded by\nmore than a thousand mutated dwarves and\nhas epic level servants like the demon\nvine following him. If things go wrong,\nthat cat might really be too scared to\ncome out. With such a large underground\npalace, finding the swift moving black\ncat would be like finding a needle in a\nhay stack. So after thinking it over,\nFong Yu decided to give up the idea of\nfinding the cat and instead explore the\nunderground palace properly. Based on\nthe direction of the underground palace\ngate in his mind, Fongu roughly guessed\nthe shape of the underground palace and\nthen led the group towards the center of\nthe underground palace. Sure enough, 2\nminutes later, they passed through a\ndark and empty corridor and arrived at a\nrow of tall pyramid-like steps. Each\nstep was about 2 m high, and there were\n17 steps in total. Fong Yu controlled\nthe fire dragon to fly upwards and saw\nan enormous golden throne at the top of\nthe steps. Tasks, I wonder if it's\ngilded or pure, Fongu exclaimed, looking\nat the enormous throne that was at least\n50 m tall. These titans are just too\nextravagant. To make it easier to see\nthe entire throne, the demonic vines\nsprouted a carpet of interwoven\ntentacles beneath everyone's feet, which\nthen grew to the same height as the\nthrone. Therefore, Fong Yu discovered\nthat on the armrest of the golden throne\nwas a golden treasure chest inlaid with\nmany gems. Upon seeing this incredibly\nluxurious treasure chest, Fong Yu\nimmediately became interested. I wonder\nwhat good stuff I might get. Fong Yu\nthen used the dance of the wind to fly\nonto the armrest of the throne and\narrived in front of the treasure chest.\nHowever, the system did not indicate\nwhat type of treasure chest it was,\nwhich meant that this treasure chest was\nnot a system reward, but rather one that\nalready existed in this dungeon. At this\nmoment, Fong Yu also noticed the keyhole\non the treasure chest. So, he took out\nhis own underground palace key, which\nwas about a foot long, and compared it.\nIt was discovered that the size was\nexactly the same as the keyhole. He he\nseems that this is the real treasure in\nthe underground palace. Fongu smiled. I\nwonder what it could be. Chapter 197.\nThe golden treasure chest full of\nmechanisms. Just as Fongu was about to\ninsert the key in his hand into the\nnearly 2 m tall treasure chest in front\nof him, the demon vine came over and\nraised its hand to stop Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s\naction. Huh? What's wrong? Fong Yu\nlooked at the demon vine with a puzzled\nexpression. The demon vine stared at the\ntreasure chest and said coldly, \"There's\nsomething moving inside.\" \"Holy crap!\"\nFong was startled when he heard this.\nThe demon vine was the strongest member\nof the team. It could sense that there\nwere living things inside, so it must be\ntrue. What could it be? Fong was very\ncurious. Despite his curiosity, he\nhanded over the task of opening the box\nto the magic vine and retreated himself.\nAfter all, his life was more important.\nIf a monster of the level of a black cat\nrushed out of the box, at least the\nmagic vine could hold it off for a\nwhile. So, the magic vine took the key\nand inserted it into the keyhole. After\ntwisting it a few times, the sound of a\nmechanical wheel turning came from\ninside the treasure chest. Then hundreds\nof holes suddenly appeared on the front\nof the treasure chest. With a roar,\ncountless metal bullets shot out from\nthe holes, directly turning the magic\nvine standing at the front into a civ.\nAs for Fong Yu, he sensed something was\nwrong as soon as he saw the hole appear\non the surface of the treasure chest and\nhid to the side, successfully avoiding\nthe bullets. What the hell? Fun was\nshocked. He hadn't expected this\ntreasure chest to have a mechanism and\nsuch a powerful one at that. Fongu had\nnever tested the strength of the demon\nvine, but it was definitely much\nstronger than when it was still a\ntentacle. He never expected that it\nwould be riddled with holes by this\nbarrage of projectiles. Fortunately, the\nmagic vine was not an ordinary creature,\nand this level of damage had no effect\non it. Soon, tiny tentacles appeared\nfrom the edges of the dense holes on its\nbody, twisting and intertwining to help\nthe wounds heal quickly. Immediately,\ntwo tentacles extended from the back of\nthe demon vine and pressed down on the\ntreasure chest, attempting to open the\nlid. However, even after the tentacles\nexerted force, the treasure chest\nremained unmoved. So, the demon vine\nturned to look at Fong Yu and said, \"It\ncan't be opened.\" Holy crap. Fongu was\nslightly takenback upon hearing this and\nsaid, \"Why don't you try again?\" The\ndemon vine didn't say anything, but\nturned around and twisted the key on the\ntreasure chest again. This time, after\ntwisting it, countless spinning saw\ngears suddenly flew out from the middle\nof the treasure chest, directly cutting\nthe nearest demon vine into two pieces.\nEven Fong Yu, who was far away, was\nalmost cut by these dozens of sawarss.\nSoon these saw gears flew into the dark\nhall, stopping only after hitting some\nstone pillars and emitting sparks. At\nthis moment, the magic vine, which had\nbeen cut into three parts, slowly merged\ntogether. So, Fong You turned the key\nfor the third time. Crack. A crystal\nsphere extended from the four sides of\nthe treasure chest, and then the crystal\nsphere emitted an extremely dazzling red\nlaser beam. This time, the powerful\nlaser beam not only instantly cut the\ndemon vine that had just crawled up from\nthe ground into three pieces, but also\nhit Fongu behind it. In a single strike,\nFong Yu's guardian stone absorbed 330\npoints of his mana before it could block\nthe red laser beam. Keep in mind that\nFong Yu only consumed 50 magic points\nwhen he withtood a full fire dragon\nspell, which is enough to show how\nterrifying this laser beam is. At this\nmoment, the demonic vine slowly fused\nits three body segments back together\nand looked at Fong Yu with a somewhat\ninnocent expression, saying, \"Master,\nalthough these methods can't kill me,\nthey still hurt a lot.\" Fong Yu took a\ndeep breath, suppressing his anger. He\nfelt like he had been tricked. Could\nthis just be a trap that looks like a\ntreasure chest? Otherwise, who the hell\nwould put so many traps in a treasure\nchest? And every time the key is turned,\na trap is triggered. This is absolutely\nmaddening to people who open treasure\nchests. Most importantly, each mechanism\nis more ingenious than the last. From\nprojectiles to chainsaws to laser beams,\nFong Yu didn't even dare to imagine what\nthe next mechanism would be. It's\nfortunate that she brought the magic\nvine. Otherwise, even Olivia, with her\nimmortality, probably wouldn't have been\nable to withstand the repeated attacks\nfrom these traps. Just then, a familiar\nsqueak sound caught Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s\nattention. He turned around and found\nthat the rat king had followed them\nthere at some point. Perhaps due to\neating too much barbecue recently, the\nrat king's already plump body has become\neven fatter. It tried to jump onto the 2\nm high steps, but after several\nattempts, it could only reach with its\nfront paws and not its hind paws. And\nfinally, it had no choice but to slide\ndown. This really worried the rat king,\nwho kept squeaking and squeaking. Fong\nYu used the dance of the wind to fly\nabove the rat king&lt;unk&gt;s head and said\nirritably, \"What are you doing here?\nIt's quite dangerous here.\" As soon as\nthe rat king saw Fong Yu arrive, it\nimmediately stood up and pointed at the\nthrone at the top of the steps with its\nshort pause, squeaking as it did so.\nFortunately, Fongu brought both Alpha\nand Olivia with him this time. With the\nhelp of his two partners translating,\nFongu finally understood what the rat\nking meant. It knows how to open that\ntreasure chest. Upon hearing this news,\nFong Yu was slightly taken aback, but\nthen slapped his forehead and said,\n\"Tanke, I should have thought of that.\nThat stone key clearly has no special\nfeatures. So why did it appear in the\nrat king's den? It must be related to\nthe rat king.\" So Fong Yu used the dance\nof the wind to lift the rat king to the\nfront of the treasure chest, and the\ndemon vine also made way for him. After\nputting the rat king down, Fun Yu said\nto it with a serious expression, \"We're\nfriends, so don't blame me for not\nwarning you. There are many traps in\nthis treasure chest. If you operated\nincorrectly, you'll most likely die.\" To\neveryone's surprise, the rat king nodded\nseriously at Fongu, then stood up\nstraight and grabbed the key that was\ninserted in the keyhole. This scene\nreally startled Fongu. Even the demonic\nvines beside him instinctively prepared\nto stand in front of Fong Yu to block\nany new traps that might appear.\nStrangely, no new attack mechanism\nappeared until the rat king pulled the\nkey out again. Then the rat king carried\nthe key to the back of the treasure\nchest and Fong Yu and the demon vine\nfollowed. Soon the rat king arrived at\none of the four corners behind the\ntreasure chest. It scratched at the\nbottom of the corner with its claws for\na while and found a sliding metal cover\nthat revealed the keyhole. The rat king\nthen inserted the key from its mouth\ninto the keyhole and started turning it.\nClick. A loud metallic spring clicked\nand the entire treasure chest began to\nshake. A moment later, the lid of the\nchest trembled violently as if it could\nbe opened. Only then did Fong Yu realize\nthat the keyhole on the front of the\ntreasure chest was a trap. No matter how\nmany times he twisted it, it would not\nopen and would only activate\nincreasingly powerful attack mechanisms.\nTsk tsk the person who designed this\ntreasure chest is utterly despicable.\nFunu couldn't help but curse. Isn't this\ndeliberately setting people up? However,\nat that moment, a deep husky voice, even\nwith a metallic quality, came from the\ntreasure chest. Who dares to insult the\ngreat Sam the golden hammer thump with a\nloud crash. The lid of the treasure\nchest was flung open, and a tall figure\nwith a full golden beard, messy golden\nhair, and even golden skin stood up from\ninside the chest. \"How dare you insult\nthe greatest leader of the dwarfs? I'll\nmake you taste my wrath. Who is it?\" The\ntall golden dwarf roared. Chapter 198.\nThe Golden Dwarf. Sam the Golden Hammer.\nWith a series of roars, the golden\ndwarf's size continued to grow. In just\none breath, it jumped from more than 2 m\nto nearly 5 m in height. you. Upon\nseeing this, Fongu retreated repeatedly.\nEven a fool could tell that this golden\ndwarf must be extremely powerful. Even\nthe demon vine silently followed Fong Yu\nas he retreated into the distance,\nclearly realizing that it was no match\nfor this golden dwarf. Just then, a\nseries of squeak, squeak, squeak sounds\nrang out, and the rat king next to the\ntreasure chest began to jump up and\ndown, seemingly trying to attract the\nattention of the golden dwarf. The tall\ndwarf, who called himself Sam the Golden\nHammer, looked down at the rat king on\nthe ground. His angry expression quickly\ndisappeared and was replaced by a look\nof surprise. He bent down and picked up\nthe rat king from the ground. \"Bilbo, is\nit really you?\" The golden dwarf asked\nthe rat king in his hand with great\nsurprise. The rat king nodded\nvigorously, then began squeaking\nincessantly at the golden dwarf as if\ntelling him something. The golden dwarf\nlistened intently, occasionally adding a\nfew words like, \"Hm, ah, I see.\nIncredible. That's too much. That's\nreally great.\" After a long while, the\nrat king stopped squawking while the\ngolden dwarf raised his hand to stroke\nhis messy golden beard and turned to\nlook at Fong Yu and the others who had\nreturned to the golden throne. Oh, so it\nwas you guys who rescued me from Bilbo.\nI was so rude earlier. I'm very sorry.\nThe tall golden dwarf climbed down from\nhis throne, slowly walked to Fong Yu and\nhis companions, squatted down, and asked\nin a friendly tone, \"Which one of you is\nFong Yu?\" \"It is I.\" Fongi took a step\nforward. The golden dwarf nodded and\nsaid, \"Bilbo told me that you helped it\na lot, not only by giving it delicious\nroasted meat, but also by rescuing it\nfrom the clutches of the crypt dwarfs.\"\n\"It was nothing,\" Fong Yu said with a\nslight smile. \"Now that you've saved me\nfrom the chest of death, I owe you a\nhuge favor,\" the golden dwarf said. So,\nyou can name two wishes provided I can\ngrant them for you as a reward for\ntaking care of Bilbo and saving me. How\nabout this deal, human? Fongu was\nslightly takenback. He hadn't expected\nthe golden dwarf to be so direct, asking\nhim to make a wish right away. So, what\nwishes can you help me fulfill? Fongu\nasked with a smile. Upon hearing this,\nthe golden dwarf raised his hand and\npatted his chest, making a series of\nduong duong duong sounds before\nconfidently declaring, \"I am Sam Golden\nHammer, chieftain of the Holy Hammer\nDwarf tribe. I once served the Great\nTitans. This dungeon is a territory\nbestowed upon me by the Great Titans. I\npossess boundless wealth and\nunparalleled forging skills. I can\ncreate the most supreme treasures in the\nworld, divine artifacts. Upon hearing\nthis, Fongu chuckled and said, \"That\nwould be great. Then you can help me\nmake two divine artifacts.\" The golden\ndwarf was completely stunned by Fong\nYu&lt;unk&gt;s words. \"No, I was just bragging\na little to satisfy my vanity. Why did\nyou take it so seriously?\" Seeing the\ndwarf's stunned expression, Fong Yu\nhesitated for a moment before saying,\n\"If all else fails, even a divine\nartifact will do.\" The Golden Dwarf\nfinally realized what was happening, he\ncouldn't help but roll his eyes. He\nwanted to refuse Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s excessive\nrequest outright, but considering that\nFong Yu had made the boast first, it\nseemed unbecoming of him as the\npatriarch of the Holy Hammer Clan to\nsimply refuse. So the golden dwarf\nreminded Fonu, \"Of course you can, but\ndivine artifacts are not so easy to\ncreate. Each divine artifact requires\ncountless rare and precious materials\nand endless effort to create. Therefore,\nthere are very few divine artifacts in\nthe world today, almost extinct.\" \"Oh,\nis that so?\" Fongu deliberately raised\nhis left hand, extended his middle\nfinger with the elegy of the dead on it,\nand scratched his nostril. But I have\nseveral. What did you say? The golden\ndwarf wanted to rebuke Fong Yu for\ntalking nonsense, but then he noticed\nthe ring on Fong Yu's middle finger, the\nartifact, the Reququum of the Dead. The\nGolden Dwarf's eyes widened in shock,\nand he even stood up from his crouching\nposition in fright. That That's the\nlegendary artifact that only the dark\ngod's messenger is qualified to use. The\nReququum of the Dead, Sam Golden\nexclaimed. Upon hearing this, Fongu\nturned around and looked at Olivia with\nsome surprise, asking, \"Weren't you the\nspokesperson? How did you become a\ndivine messenger?\" Olivia explained,\n\"The messenger of the gods is the\nmessenger of the god of darkness,\nresponsible for conveying the god of\ndarkness's will. And you are the god of\ndarkness's spokesperson. Your words are\nthe god of darkness's will.\" \"Oh, I\nsee.\" Fongu nodded, then turned to the\ntall dwarf and said, \"Now you know. I\nseem to be a bit higher up than that\ndivine messenger. After a long silence,\nthe golden dwarf actually knelt down\nbefore Fong Yu and said in a sincere\ntone, \"Great spokesperson for the dark\ngod, Sam Golden Hammer is deeply sorry\nfor my previous rudeness and abruptness.\nPlease punish me.\" Ah, this Fongu was\nalso a little confused. What was going\non? At this moment, Olivia moved closer\nto Fong Yu and explained. The Holy\nHammer dwarves worship the dark god.\nHuh? Really? Fong Yu asked curiously.\nThe name Holy Hammer doesn't sound like\nit belongs to the God of Light faction,\ndoes it? The dwarves of the light\nfaction are called the Hammer of Light,\nand they belong to the mountain dwarfs.\nWe are the cave dwarfs. The name Holy\nHammer was given to us by the dark titan\nCedric. The dwarf Sam explained to Fong\nYu. From now on, you will be the master\nof our holy hammer clan, the great\nspokesperson of the dark god, Lord Fong\nYu. H it seems the title of the dark god\nis quite effective. Fongu couldn't help\nbut shake his head and say, \"This really\nproves the saying. To survive in this\nworld, you need a background and power.\nHow many people are left in your holy\nhammer clan?\" Funu asked. and what are\nsome of the more powerful abilities of\nyour holy hammer clan? This question\nstumped the nearly 5 m tall dwarf. He\nscratched his messy blonde hair and\nlaughed sheepishly. Actually, I've been\nlocked in that death chest for many\nyears, and I don't even know if my\npeople are still alive. Locked up? Fongu\nraised an eyebrow and asked, \"Who locked\nyou up?\" Upon hearing this, the golden\ndwarf felt a surge of anger. It's a damn\nTitan cat. Chapter 199, The Dwarf's\nRevenge Plan. That day, I was patrolling\nthe underground palace as usual when\nsuddenly my people told me that the trap\nweapon I had made, the death treasure\nchest, had been stolen. It was the trap\nI was preparing to use to kill the demon\nlord pseudo. It contained many powerful\nweapons and magic. If it fell into the\nhands of the enemy, the consequences\nwould be unimaginable. It turned out\nthat Sally was the one who stole the\ndeath chest. Yes, that Titan cat. She\ntreated the death chest like a toy. I\nwent to ask her for it back, but she\nplayed hideand seek with me. I finally\nfound the death chest, but Sally had\nalready triggered its ultimate skill,\ndark seal. She dodged it quickly and\nwasn't sucked in, but I was the one who\ngot sucked in. And then I was trapped in\nthat death chest. And I'm still trapped\nthere today. Sam the golden dwarf\nrecounted in a deep muffled voice the\nstory of how he was tricked by Sally the\nTitan cat. I didn't expect the story to\nbe so complicated. Fongu sighed. So\nyou're also going to cause trouble for\nthat giant cat. The golden dwarf nodded\nand said although I've known it for so\nmany years, it really went too far this\ntime. I must teach it a lesson. Do you\nknow how to find it? Coincidentally,\nwe're looking for it, too. Funu laughed.\nWe also have a little personal grudge\nagainst it. Upon hearing this, the\ngolden dwarf tentatively asked, \"Then\nwill you kill it?\" Fongu shrugged\nnon-committally and said, \"That depends\non its attitude.\" By the way, I almost\nforgot to ask. Is that Titan cat also\npart of the dark gods faction? The\ngolden dwarf nodded and said, \"Yes, it\nalso serves the darkness.\" Fong Yu\nslapped his thigh and said, \"That makes\nthings much easier. It seems like it was\nall a misunderstanding before. Looking\nback now, Fong Yu realized that when he\nfirst met the giant cat, it never\nattacked him. It only slapped away\nAlpha, who had been scratching it. Now,\nhe thought that it must have smelled the\nscent on him that was related to the\ndark god, which was why it didn't make a\nmove. Otherwise, given my strength at\nthe time, even with the explosives as\ncover, I wouldn't have been able to\nsurvive that giant cat. So Fong Yu said,\n\"In that case, let's&lt;unk&gt; go find it,\nteach it a lesson where it needs to be\ntaught a lesson, and clear up any\nmisunderstandings that need to be\ncleared up.\" Upon hearing this, the\ngolden dwarf rose and cast a fireball\nspell in front of the throne. Soon, a\nhuge torch ignited, followed by hundreds\nof giant torches that illuminated the\nentire hall. These torches were embedded\nin the hands of ancient stone statues on\nthe halls pillars. Illuminated by the\nflames of hundreds of torches, Fong Yu\nfinally got a good look at this\nincredibly spacious underground palace.\nHundreds of stone pillars were carved\ninto lielike statues. The ground was\npaved with huge intact stone bricks that\nlooked like jade, and some of them were\neven engraved with mysterious ruins. At\nthe center of the palace was a huge\ngolden throne which looked like the\nthrone of some Titan god. After the\ndwarf Sam lit the torches in the hall,\nhe saw the dwarf demons that had been\nmutated by the parasitic seeds of the\ndemonic vines. He immediately frowned\nand asked, \"How come there are so many\ndwarf demons in the dungeon? Did you\nbring them?\" Fongu shook his head and\nsaid, \"I killed these dwarves after I\nentered the dungeon, and since I came\nin, I haven't seen a second dwarf\nbesides you. So, so I know now, the\ngolden dwarf said, a hint of sorrow\nflashing in his eyes. It seems these\ndwarf demons must be my former people.\nHuh? Fongu was stunned for a moment. He\nraised an eyebrow and asked, \"What do\nyou mean?\" The Golden Dwarf said in a\ndeep voice. \"In the demon realm, there\nis a race of demons called the Demon\nSoul Clan who are very good at\nassimilating other races into demons,\njust like the guy next to you.\" He\npointed to the demon vines and said,\n\"These dwarf demons should be the\ndwarves who were assimilated by the\ndemon soul clan.\" Confused, Funu turned\nto look at the demon vine and Alpha and\nasked, \"Is that so?\" Alpha squinted and\nthought for a moment before nodding.\n\"Movine,\" however, said directly.\n\"That's indeed true. I wouldn't have\nthought of it if he hadn't mentioned\nit.\" \"Then why would there be demons in\nthis underground palace?\" Funu asked,\npuzzled. Isn't this the palace of the\ntitans? The golden dwarf smiled Riley\nand said, \"This was indeed once the\npalace of the titans, but that Titan was\nthe dark titan, the Titan who ruled the\ndemon realm in the underworld.\nTherefore, there is a passage to the\ndemon realm in this underground palace.\nI think it must have been after I was\nlocked in the treasure chest of death\nthat those demons from the demon realm\ntook advantage of the situation and\ncorrupted all my people into dwarf\ndemons. Sam slammed his fist into the\nstone pillar beside him, roaring, \"Damn\ndemons! Damn Sally! I'll make them pay.\"\nUpon hearing this, Fongu glanced at\nAlpha, then quietly leaned closer to the\ndog and whispered, \"Did you know about\nthis?\" Upon hearing this, Alpha\nimmediately shook his head, indicating\nthat he was completely unaware of the\nmatter and had no involvement\nwhatsoever. \"Are the demon race also\npart of the dark gods faction?\" \"Woof\nwoof!\" Alpha barked softly while Olivia\ntranslated. Once the demon race belonged\nto the dark side. But later the demon\nemperor was killed and the new demon\nemperor who was also the lord of the\ndemon realm pius betrayed the dark god\nand offered the entire demon realm to\nthe god realm. In exchange he gave all\nthe fallen angels the right to return to\nthe god realm. There's still this much\nto it. Fongu sighed after hearing this.\nThen there's no problem. Fong Yu then\nturned to the golden dwarf and said,\n\"Taking advantage of someone's\nmisfortune is indeed despicable. I'm\nwilling to help you fight against the\ndemon realm.\" And that Titan cat named\nSally. Really? Sam was overjoyed. He\nbelieved that with the help of the dark\ngods representative, he would surely be\nable to avenge his great grudge. But\nlet's make this clear first. You already\nowe me two favors. If I add the favors\nI'll do for you to deal with the demon\nrealm and that cat, then you'll owe me\nfour favors. Round it up, you owe me\nfour divine artifacts.\nChapter 200. The gate to the demon\nrealm. There are always unexpected\nthings that happen in this world. After\nfinally finding a treasure chest, it\nturned out to be a deadly treasure chest\nriddled with traps. And inside was a\ngolden dwarf, Sam the Golden Hammer, who\nhad been imprisoned for who knows how\nmany years. The key point is that this\ndwarf is actually over 5 m tall. This\nonce again redefined Fong Yu's standard\nof understanding height in this world.\nOnly now did he realize that humans\ntruly did not deserve to be described as\nshort. Through the Golden Dwarf's\ndetailed explanation, Fongu learned that\nthe dwarfs he was so determined to kill\nwere nothing more than pitiful holy\nhammered dwarves who had been\nassimilated by the demon race. His goal\nhas now changed from killing the dwarfs\nto avenging the golden dwarves and\neliminating the demons who assimilated\nthe dwarfs. And of course, there's\ncatching that Titan cat. First, they had\nto eliminate the real demons, which was\nundoubtedly much more difficult than\neliminating the low intelligence dwarves\nof the dungeons. Fongu hadn't even seen\nwhat the so-called demon soul clan\nlooked like yet. So, he asked Alpha\nabout the demon soul clan beforehand. As\na result of Fong Yu's question, Alpha\nimmediately started howling excitedly\nlike a husky whose house had been\ndestroyed, barking and howling. So\nOlivia had no choice but to provide\nsimultaneous translation for Alpha. The\nDemon Soul Clan is a bunch of cowardly,\ndespicable, two-faced, treacherous, and\nutterly dishonest demon scum. They have\ndefiled the noble bloodline of the demon\nrace. They are sinners of the demon\nrace. Blah blah blah. Upon hearing the\nimplication in Alpha's words, Fong Yu\nknew that it must have had a grudge\nagainst this demon soul clan, otherwise\nit wouldn't have started cursing right\naway. Can you get to the point? Fong Yu\ninterrupted Alpha speechlessly. Tell me\ntheir specific abilities and weaknesses.\nAt this moment, the Golden Giant Sam\nsaid, I am also quite familiar with the\ndemon soul race, so let me speak.\nStrictly speaking, the demon soul race\ncannot actually be considered the\noriginal inhabitants of the demon realm.\nThey are fallen beings from the mortal\nworld who fled to the demon realm to\nescape the pursuit of their enemies. In\nthis world, there are humans, elves,\norcs, and of course, there are dwarves\nlike us. In order to integrate into the\ndemon realm, they use dark secret arts\nto fuse with the bloodline of the\northodox demon race, thus creating the\ndemon soul race. Using dark secret\ntechniques to fuse with the bloodline of\nthe orthodox demon race, Fongu was\ncompletely bewildered. Not only did he\nfail to grasp the characteristics of the\ndemon soul race, but he also discovered\nthat the demon soul race was far more\ncomplex than he had imagined. \"In short,\nthey all have a mixture of attributes,\nand the stronger a member of the demon\nsoul clan, the more complex their\nbloodline. You'll see what it's like\nwhen you see it,\" Sam said in a deep\nvoice. Fong Yu nodded and asked, \"All\nright, then where do we go now? Should\nwe look for that cat first, or should we\ndeal with those demon soul clan members\nfirst?\" Sam glanced at the area behind\nthe main hall and said, \"First, I need\nto get my weapons back.\" After saying\nthis, the golden dwarf placed the rat\nking in his hand on his shoulder and\nstroed towards the depths of the\nunderground palace. Taking the\nopportunity, Fun Yu beckoned to Emo\nTong, Olivia, and Alpha, drawing his\nthree companions to his side and\nwhispering. \"So, what do you guys think?\nIs this dwarf reliable?\" Olivia said\ncalmly. \"As far as I know, dwarves love\nto swear and be violent, but they rarely\nlie.\" After pondering for a moment, the\ndemon vine replied, \"I think with its\nstrength, it can completely crush us. It\nshouldn't need to resort to lies to deal\nwith us. Alpha woof woof. Fong Yu\nglanced at Olivia who then translated.\nIt says, \"What's there to be afraid of?\"\nSince Guzy said he was scared of\nnothing, Fong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s continued caution\nwould seem a bit cowardly. So, he had no\nchoice but to lead his three companions\nand follow the golden dwarf deeper into\nthe underground palace. After walking\nnearly 300 m, the magic vine reminded\nFong Yu that they had gone beyond the\nrange of the parasitic seed spread and\nthat they would likely encounter living\ndwarf demons in the deeper area. Sure\nenough, after walking for a while, a\ndozen or so dwarf demons appeared in\nfront of them. When they heard the\ncommotion of Fong Yu and his group, the\ndwarf demons initially thought they were\ntheir companions and did not attack\nthem. However, to Fong Yu's surprise,\nSam the tall golden dwarf actually\nwalked towards the group of dwarf\ndemons. Let the flames purify your\nbodies, my poor people. With the golden\ndwarf shout, a red magic circle suddenly\nappeared beneath the feet of the crypt\ndwarfs, followed by a pillar of ghostly\nblue fire rising from beneath each\ndwarf's feet. In the blink of an eye,\nbefore those dwarf demons could even\nfinish their screams, they were all\nburned to ashes by the blue pillar of\nfire. This Fa was stunned by what he\nsaw. It was the first time he had ever\nseen someone release blue flame magic.\nMoreover, even the dwarf demon with\nextremely high fire resistance couldn't\nwithstand the blue flame for more than 3\nseconds and turned into ashes. What kind\nof divine magic is this? Fongu turned to\nOlivia and asked. Olivia hesitated for a\nmoment, then said somewhat uncertainly,\n\"This seems to be a top tier fire magic\nspell. The wrath of the fire god.\" The\ngolden dwarf turned to look at Olivia,\nchuckled, and said, \"You have some\ninsight. That's right. This is the wrath\nof Vulcan.\" Fong Yu had heard Valentina\nsay that only mages of the arch mage\nlevel or above could cast this top tier\nmagic. But the golden giant had just\nreleased it without even chanting. \"This\nmeans that's right. I am actually a fire\nelemental holy mage,\" Sam said in a deep\nvoice. \"After all, as a master\nblacksmith, only by using the magical\nflames I summon myself can I forge the\nmost perfect and exquisite equipment.\"\nAt this point, Sam looked at the\ngradually dying blue flames and sighed\nhelplessly. I never imagined that in the\nend, I would have to use this magic to\npurify my poor people. After saying\nthat, the golden dwarf continued to walk\ndeeper into the underground palace.\nLooking at its huge and lonely figure,\nFong Yu felt a little sad. He must have\nfelt terrible killing these demonized\npeople with his own hands. Soon, the\ngroup passed through the entire empty\nunderground palace hall. After burning\nnearly a hundred dwarf demons along the\nway, Sam led Fong Yu and the others to\nthe edge of a cliff, which appeared to\nbe a deep well dug by man. Fong Yu\nlooked down along the cliff and saw\nrolling lava hundreds of meters below.\nOn the cliff were winding and rugged\nwalkways, and there were many huge metal\nchains and pulleys embedded in the\nwalls. The steel cables on the pulleys\nhung down and pulled giant barrels\nfilled with lava to a platform in the\nmiddle of the cliff. There, the group\nsaw hundreds of brownskinned dwarves\nbusily at work. Some of the dwarves were\npulling buckets of lava into a huge\nfurnace, and then they began adding\nother fuels to the furnace. Some dwarves\nwere turning over the smoking molds,\nsmashing them with their hammers to\nextract the still red hot spears and\nswords that had just taken shape. Other\ndwarves then used huge iron clamps to\nplace these weapons onto a metal\nconveyor belt and send them to the next\nproduction line. Upon seeing this, Fong\nYu gasped and exclaimed, \"This looks\nlike an arms factory down there. Those\ndwarfves must be your people, right?\"\nThe golden dwarf nodded solemnly and\nsaid, \"That's right. There was a large\nsmelting factory down here, and those\npeople are all my people.\" That's\nstrange. Since there are still dwarves\nhere, why haven't they come to the\nunderground palace to rescue you for so\nlong? Funu asked in confusion. At that\nmoment, Sam pointed to a spot below and\nsaid, \"Look over there. On that throne\nsits that golden dwarf wearing a crown.\nDoesn't it look exactly like me?\" Fongu\nlooked in the direction Sam pointed and\nsaw a golden dwarf who looked almost\nexactly like Sam sitting on a smaller\ngolden throne. He was holding a crystal\nwine jug in his left hand and a shiny\npork knuckle in his right, seemingly\nenjoying a hearty meal. In an instant,\nFongu understood. \"So, the golden dwarf\nbelow, who looks exactly like you, is\nactually an impostor, and that impostor\nhas been ruling over the dwarves below.\"\nFunu guessed. Sam nodded, speculating,\n\"That must be it. The demon souls are\nvery good at impersonating others. They\nimpersonated me and then tricked my\npeople into forging weapons for them.\nNot only the one impersonating me, but\nmany of the dwarves among them were\nfakes. At this point, Sam pointed to the\nonly stone staircase leading from the\nunderground palace to the armory below,\nwhich had been sealed off. He gritted\nhis teeth in grief and said, \"That\nimpostor of mine sealed off the passage\nbetween the underground palace and the\nlower level. Probably because he was\nafraid my people would find me and\nrescue me. So, what should we do?\" Funu\nasked. \"Should we go down and kill the\ndemon soul clan member who is\nimpersonating you and expose their\nconspiracy? Or do you have a better\nplan?\" A flash of resentment crossed the\ngolden dwarf's eyes as he coldly said.\nThe bastards of the demon soul clan must\nbe killed. But before that, I must kill\nanother bastard. As he spoke, the golden\ndwarf conjured a fireball in his hand\nand threw it behind the group. Under the\nfireballs illumination, a black figure\nflashed past, dodging the incoming\nfireball. It was the Titan cat. At that\nmoment, the golden dwarf's eyes blazed\nwith fury as he looked at the Titan cat.\nSally, I can't believe you dare show\nyour face. Confess honestly. Are you\ncolluding with the demon soul clan?\nAfter he finished speaking, three more\nfireballs the size of basketball\nbackboards appeared above Sam's head.\nWith a wave of his hand, the golden\ndwarf sent the three enormous fireballs\nhurtling towards the Titan cat. Faced\nwith the three fireballs hurtling\ntowards it, the Titan cat showed no\npanic. Everyone only felt a blur before\ntheir eyes, and the black cat's figure\nappeared dozens of meters away. At the\nsame time, the black cat actually spoke,\n\"You guessed right, you idiot.\" Upon\nhearing this, the golden dwarf glared at\nthe giant cat and roared, \"Do you know\nwhat this means? You have betrayed the\ndark titan. You have betrayed the dark\ngod.\" The giant cat raised its front\npaw, stroked its whiskers, and said\nlazily. The dark titan abandoned me, and\nthe dark god is about to fall, \"What's\nwrong with me changing masters?\" Sam was\nspeechless after being choked by the\ngiant cat's words, so he asked again.\n\"So, you mean that when you stole my\ntrap box and then triggered the\nmechanism to lock me in, it was all\npremeditated?\" The Titan cat sneered.\nYou're not only blindly loyal, but also\nincredibly stupid. You're only realizing\nthis now. The golden dwarf slowly\nclenched his fists, and endless anger\nbegan to burn in his chest. Then, a\nlayer of flames slowly ignited on his\nbody, as if the god of fire had\ndescended to earth. Since that's the\ncase, then you might as well die. With\nthe golden dwarf's furious roar, dozens\nof enormous fireballs appeared above his\nhead and hurled wildly at the Titan cat.\nHowever, the Titan cat instantly\ntransformed into a black shadow, dodging\nthe dozens of fireballs and disappearing\ninto the darkness. Then, its shrill\nvoice came from the darkness. Deal with\nthe guests I brought before dealing with\nme. As soon as the giant cat finished\nspeaking, Fong Yu looked down into the\ngiant pit and saw a vortex appearing in\nthe deepest lava pool. Crimson lava\ncontinuously poured into the slowly\nexpanding vortex and then disappeared\ninto a black and red light curtain\nwithin the vortex. Within seconds,\ncountless strangelooking creatures\nsuddenly surged out from the black and\nred light curtain in the vortex, howling\nas they flew towards the underground\npalace above.",
