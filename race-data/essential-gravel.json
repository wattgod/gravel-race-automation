Any elevation challenges come from shorter sections between the lake-dotted terrain. Less climbing than The Mid South."

Late May through mid-June timing provides a two-plus week window to dodge bad weather entirely. The self-supported format means you control when to ride, avoiding weather-related mechanical challenges during fixed-date events. Smart scheduling for Wisconsin's variable spring conditions with complete flexibility to pick favorable days. Similar climate challenges to SBT GRVL."

The event explicitly welcomes riders \"participating in their first-ever gravel ride\" like Suzanne Meerdink across three distance options.

The flexible timing eliminates premium lodging needs since you can ride any day during the window. Trail pass runs minimal ($5 annual) unless you hit the waiver weekend, keeping total costs extremely low for accessing quality rail-trail networks. Similar expense level to Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

          "transcript": "[Music]\nwhether you've been riding road bikes\nand you want to mix things up and start\nriding gravel or get away from the roads\nor you are brand new to cycling and even\nyou want to start off with some gravel\nriding that is always a good idea to\nbrush up on your bike handling skills\nit's going to make you a whole load more\nconfident on the bike as well as faster\ntwo plus when you're riding your bike\nyou want to look like a pro like you\nknow what you're doing so in this video\nI'm going to give you some gravel by\nCameron skills let's get into it\nforeign\nI'm going to talk about is tire pressure\nand you're probably wondering why I'm\ntalking about tire pressure when it's\nnot even a skill well good job for\nnoticing that but the tire pressure is\nreally important and it's going to make\nthe upcoming scales a lot harder if you\nget your tire pressure wrong but the\ntire pressure all depends on what kind\nof surface you're riding on if you're\nriding on smooth gravel then you can get\naway with having a little bit more\npressure in your tires but if you're on\nthe really rough bumpy stuff then you're\ngoing to want a little bit less pressure\nin your tires to give you a little bit\nmore cushioning and make it a lot more\ncomfortable for you so it's a basic one\nbut a good one to get right\nnow if you've been doing lots of Road\nriding before you'll know that you don't\nreally move your body around that much\non the bike you kind of almost just sit\nthere and let the bike do its thing find\nthe gravel bikes sometimes you're gonna\nneed to move your body around a lot more\nsay you're going down some really\ntechnical bumpy stuff which you can do\non a gravel bike then you'll want to\nkind of get out the saddle put your\nhands on the drops and your pedals in\nthe three and the nine o'clock position\nand from there you almost want to use\nyour body as suspension so you can just\nlet the bike kind of movement underneath\nyou this is going to really help make\nthings a lot more comfortable for you on\nthe bike and I know it's quite hard to\nsay relax when you're on your bike but\nif you tense up and you grip your\nhandlebars really hard and you know\nyou're kind of using all the muscles in\nyour arms then it's going to get very\ntiring very quickly and it's going to\nmake for a bumpy ride as well so try and\nloosen up give it a practice when you're\nnext out get up and just let the bike\nmove underneath you let's do something\nlike jam\nnow when you're on the road the terrain\nis usually all the same it never really\nchanges that much you're always on some\nsort of Road we're only on the gravel it\ncan vary a lot you could be on compact\ngravel you could be on loose gravel you\ncould be on Sand or you could be on\nreally bumpy Rocky stuff\nwhen you're on all those different types\nof terrain you're going to want to\nCorner differently for each one and when\nyou're on the road you can usually\nchoose whatever line you want into the\ncorner you can come out wide you can cut\nin and then out on the gravel it's a\nlittle bit differently you could come\ninto the corner it can be nice and\nsmooth gravel and then you can exit and\nit can be really loose so it really does\npay dividends to have the knowledge to\nscan up ahead and understand what type\nof gravel it is and then adapt your\ncornering to that\nfor one scale you can do that is going\nto help is going out on your gravel ride\njust find a nice bit of gravel road and\njust practice doing some skins practice\nsee how far around you can get your back\nwheel do a few different tricks and it\nis really going to help for when it\ncomes to cornering and say if your bike\ndoes slide out you can just correct it\nand then it'll look quite cool\nnext up how to ride your bike on the\nreal bumpy stuff now in gravel you can\nget extreme bumpy surfaces and despite\nthe bumpiness you can actually ride\nquite fast on them and as soon as you\nhit that bumpy surface the first thing\nyou're going to notice your hands and\nyour arms shaking a lot on maybe your\nteeth but you want to your automatic\nresponse to that would be to tense up a\nlittle bit and kind of grip the\nhandlebars a little bit harder but you\nalmost want to avoid doing that and just\nrelax have a little bit of a softer grip\nnot as soft but your hands are just\ngoing to fly off the handlebars because\nthat's not going to be good again like I\nsaid before you want to almost use your\nbody as suspension because we haven't\ngot suspension on a bike apart from a\nlittle bit of suspension in our tires if\nyou have the right tire pressure again\nthat's very important but on the topic\nof your hands controversial when and\nquite a lot of people come at me for not\nwearing gloves when I'm on my gravel\nbike but really I just find it a lot\nmore comfortable my hands tend to swell\na lot from the bumpy surfaces and they\nkind of rub a little bit so I prefer not\nto wear gloves but you might prefer it\nand find it more comfortable so it's\ntotally up to you what you decide to do\nso just try and relax your body and\nif it is just too bumpy for you there's\nno shame of getting off and walking I've\ndone it plenty of times\nnext up riding over things on your\ngravel bike now\nI'll be honest before I was in the\nmindset of I'd see something quite scary\nlooking I'd get off and just put it back\non my shoulder and kind of jump over it\nand then get back on but in reality you\ncan ride over a lot of things on your\ngravel bike but it is going to take a\nlittle bit of practice a lot of things\nyou can probably just roll over without\neven realizing you don't need to do\nprobably wheel up or your back wheel if\nyou just roll over it but we are going\nto practice\nfacts and over things\nand for that you're going to need to\nfind yourself a piece of wood that is\nfalling off a tree and is now going to\nbe used for your free bit of equipment\nfor gravel bike handling skills so find\nyourself a lovely looking log looks a\nlittle bit like a gun pow pow pow\num but then you want to put it on the\nfloor and we are going to practice\nbouncing over it let's do it\nnow you can do this with or without a\nlog it might be a good idea first just\nto practice you know put in your front\nwheel up and then pulling your back\nwheel up and it really is quite easy you\ncan literally just pull it up you can\njust do a little wheelie over it and\nthen I just pull my feet up and my back\nwheel comes up and then essentially you\nget this\nand you get over it lovely jubbly so\nlet's give that a go\nhow about you I won't do it now\nonce you get confident in clearing a\nsmall log like this one you can move on\nto bigger logs or bigger bricks or\nwhatever you have\nthat you can jump over and the next\nthing you know you'll be going out in\nyour bike and you will not be getting\noff\nto jump over anything you'd be riding\nover everything\nwhoops\nokay this next one is a tricky one\nriding in sand and obviously here today\nthere isn't much sand but Ollie\nBridgewood is actually going to show us\nhow to ride in sand so over to you ollie\num\noh well that didn't really goes fine I\nguess Ollie's not going to show us how\nto understand do not do not try and ride\nand sound like a lolly Richard now we\nhaven't got any sand here today\nobviously but here are some of my top\ntips on the compact hard sound you're\nnot going to have a problem riding\nthrough that it's just gonna be like\nriding through a smooth bit of gravel\nbut it's the really loose sand that is\ngoing to be the trickiest now you want\nto hit it with a good amount of speed\nand that'll give you the best chances of\ngetting through to the other side to\nwherever you're going but if you hit\nthat loose sand with quite low speed\nyour chances are going to be quite slim\nof getting through and once you hit that\nsand you're going to notice that your\nbike is going to have a mind of its own\nit's going to want to go left right\nabsolutely everywhere but my tip would\nbe try and relax on a bike let the bike\ndo its thing and just try and keep\npedaling through the sand and look where\nyou want to go\ncliche but the more time you spend on\nthe bike the more comfortable you'll\nfeel and before you know it nothing will\nphase you on your bike so get out there\nspend time on it play around with it\nhave some fun\njust enjoy it so those are some of my\ntop skills that I think you need when\nyou're out on your gravel bike but do\nlet me know down in the comment section\nbelow if you have any of your own little\ndrills that you do out on your bike I\nwould love to hear them and as always if\nyou did enjoy this video make sure to\ngive it a big thumbs up and I'll see you\nin the next one",

          "transcript": "[Applause]\ntaking your bike off-road\nexploring and having fun is at the heart\nof gravel riding\nbut you don't need all of the latest kit\nand to be honest you don't even need a\ndedicated gravel bike\na plenty of road bikes will actually be\nmore than up to the job of riding\noff-road\nover my years of off-road riding\nexperience through making mistakes and\ntrial and error\ni've come up with all the little things\nthat can help make your off-road riding\nyour gravel riding as smooth and as easy\nas possible\ni've brought my esteemed colleague\nrupert here he's a newbie gravel rider\nand we're going to go through some of\nthe mistakes and how to avoid them\nwhen it comes to gravel riding\n[Music]\nso one of the biggest mistakes people\nmake is to do with tire pressure\nprobably the most important thing to\nconsider when it comes to gravel riding\nso what pressure should i run my tires\nout then james well\nthe big thing with tire pressure\nespecially when it comes to gravel one\nis\nit's all a balancing act it's a balance\nbetween traction\ncomfort and rolling resistance a low\ntire pressure will give you more\ntraction and comfort\nbut too low and you run the risk of\npunches and damage in your rims\ni see what you mean because if i was to\nride gravel i live in london to get out\nto the trails i'm going to have to do\na pretty long slog on quite a lot of\ntarmac so i need some quite high\npressures in my tires\notherwise i'm going to get really tired\nyeah this is the biggest thing there's\nsadly not one perfect solution that\nworks for every single person so for\nyourself then a higher tyre pressure is\nprobably going to be a better option\nif you're only doing a lot of sort of\nlight gravel riding however for myself\nwhere i go and do a lot of like proper\nforest tracks a lot of mountain bike\ntrails actually a lower tire pressure is\nbetter because for me\nhis traction and comfort is more\nimportant than speed\nto start off with what i'd recommend is\nyou look at the manufacture of your\ntyres and then go to their website\nbecause a lot of those websites actually\nhave little tables where you can\nactually either see\nwhat tyre pressure to start off with\ndepending on what tyre you've got the\nwidth\nand also your weight or they have a\nlittle drop down so you can put in all\nof your information and it'll give you\nrecommended starting points and as i\nsaid those are starting points and then\nit's a question of\nbasically experimenting now we're not\ntalking about just as you did like sort\nso letting loads of air\nout we're talking about maybe checking\nit and change it by one or two psi at a\ntime\nsee how it feels you're looking for that\nbalance as i said it's all about\nbalance and the other thing to consider\nas well is obviously\ntires are different widths the different\nvolumes as a rule of thumb\nthe bigger the tire you've got the lower\nthe pressure you can go but\nit's just one thing to consider so if\nyou've got a narrow tire then you can't\nreally run it at too\nlower pressure the next thing for us to\nconsider\nis your tyre choice now with a road bike\nit's simple almost every single tire\nlooks the same and performs the same\nwhereas on a gravel bike you can have so\nmany\ndifferent types it becomes really really\nconfusing\nso my tyres they look a lot different to\nyour tyres\nyeah in a way gravel bikes have more in\ncommon with mountain bikes than road\nbikes when it comes to tire choices\nespecially the tread patterns\nand there are so many different things\nas you said you've got a very smooth\nrolling\ntire tread there and i've got a much\nmore aggressive\nknobbly tyre here and they're designed\nto do different things\nand for this my tip here is to consider\nwhere you ride\nyour bike now if you do a lot of very\nsmooth\ngravel rides or just canal tow paths or\nso on\nthen a smooth rolling tire is gonna feel\nfaster and it's gonna perform\nreally really well on those whereas if\nlike myself you do a lot more\nin proper woodland or single track or\neven like rocky mountains\nwell a treaded tyre with more aggressive\ntread\nwill give you way more traction and way\nmore confidence when it comes to\ncornering but the important thing is\nnot to worry if you don't have the right\ntire choice it's all about considering\nwhere you're riding\nand basically mitigating the situation\nso if you're riding properly off-road\nwith a tire like this then you need to\nbe aware that you might have bits where\nit's going to be slippery and\nlose traction so either just take a bit\nmore caution\nor just even lower the tire pressure to\nget a bit more traction\nthird tip is saddle height i think mine\nmight have been\na little bit high so in general it's\nprobably good to keep your saddle at\naround about the same height as you\nwould your road bike just from a\npedaling efficiency point of view\nhowever if you're going to be riding a\nbit more sort of technical and bumpy\nterrain\nyou might want to consider dropping your\nsaddle height a little bit\n10 15 mil it doesn't need to be a huge\namount but that will give you a lot more\nconfidence when it comes to tackling\nthat harder terrain and more importantly\nas you just found out it's going to make\nit easier to get off the bike\nfor those bits where inevitably you\nmight need to\nlowering your saddle height will also\nlower your center of gravity which will\nmake you feel a lot more confident on\nthe bike when you're riding\ntechnical terrain especially downhill it\nwill stop you from feeling like you're\ngoing to be toppling over the front and\ngive you more traction as well\nand for those really steep bits it means\nit will allow you to actually slide\nyourself off the back\na lot easier my second ride position tip\nis all about the front end going\noff-road is\nnot the time to slam your stem and a\ngravel bike often works best with a\nslightly higher handlebar position\nbringing your handlebars up just a\nlittle bit allows you to center yourself\nin between the wheels which is better\nfor traction\nbut also it means it puts you in a bit\nmore of an upright position\nwhich allows you to look further ahead\nso you can see what obstacles are coming\nand also allows you to keep a little bit\nof movement in your arms\nbecause with no suspension you kind of\nneed something that's going to help you\nto deal with all the obstacles\nand the bumps so allowing your arms to\nbe nice and loose\nmeans that you've got more ability to\nactually deal with\nroots rocks and other bumps that you can\nfind on the trails\nriding off-road is not the time to use a\ntraditional road bike pedal and shoe\nsetup\nmost people opt for mounted bike\nclip-less pedals and shoes\nthis is preferable because there's going\nto be times when you're going to need to\nget off your bike and\npush when you're off-road mounted bike\nshoes have a recessed sole\nwhere the cleat goes and loads and loads\nof treads so it makes it easier to get\ntraction\nand to walk and of course it means you\ndon't have to worry\nabout putting your feet down at any\npoint joking aside though\nmost roadies would consider a stiffer\nsole is better when it comes to riding\nis that the case for gravel riding too\nyeah you can always use like a stiff\nmounted mic ratio like rupert has on\nhere\nbut sometimes that can be a little bit\nuncomfortable for long distances in this\ncase\na soft assault shoe is going to be a\ngood option\nand for some people if you want to you\ncan even use flat pedals and trainers\njust to get the confidence and to make\nsure that you can just walk around\nwhenever you want to\nmy next tip is to do water bottles well\nreally water bottle cages and how\nimportant it is to choose\ngood bottle cages or\nto have any at all probably\nit's really important that you've got\ngood cages on a gravel bike\nbecause when you're riding off-road not\nonly do you find yourself\ndrinking a lot more but you find\nyourself bouncing around a lot more\nand there's nothing worse than making it\ndown a really cool section of trail\nlook down and your bottle is missing not\nonly are you littering\nbut it means then you're pretty screwed\nfor the rest of the ride when it comes\nto your hydration\nso it's important that you choose bottle\ncages that hold your bottles\nreally really securely and if you want\nto test it make sure you test your\nbottle cages\nwith full bottles because there's a\ndifference in terms of the weight\nand if you choose different size bottles\nput the bigger bottle on the vertical\nbecause it means it's going to have less\nchance of bouncing out\nmy next tip is actually taking a cue\nfrom the scouts and\nit's be prepared or in this case\ncarrying\nspares and tools compared to riding a\nroad bike\nriding a gravel bike gives so many more\nopportunities for a mechanical\npunches are the obvious thing because\nyou're riding in places where there's\nlots of obstacles and dirt and debris\nbut all of that bouncing and rattling\ncan shake apart your\nbike like nothing else bolts can come\nloose\nyou can snap chains and even snap spokes\nquite easily when you're on\nrides like this so it's important that\nyou carry\nenough spares and tools and also know\nhow to use them\nto be able to safely carry on your ride\nso\nwhat should i have on me right now for\nthis gravel ride\nwell the very very basics you should\nhave would be\nan inner tube a pump and obviously a\nmulti-tool that has a chain tool on it\nnow the great thing with gravel bikes is\nit's cool to have a bag\nor cool to have somewhere to store these\nthings so it's really easy to keep these\nthings on your bike\nso in mine in this one here i've got a\nlittle spare inner tube\nnow obviously this is probably going to\nbe a bit small for these so i've got\nanother inner tube here\ni've then got a co2 so a little inflator\nand then i've got this really cool\nlittle device here and that's got my\nmulti-tool with a chain tool on it\nbut if you don't have that and you're\njust riding a normal kit like this then\nobviously you can carry things you can\ncarry your pump\ntwo other really important things to\ncarry that\npeople really do forget all the time is\nto carry a couple of zip ties\nand some tape now the great thing is zip\nties\ncan be used to fix almost anything that\nfalls off your bike\nso they're kind of really good to have\nwith you and tape well yeah a bit of\nelectrical tape\ncan help if you get a tear on your tire\nor\nany other jobs as well i carry my tape\non my pump\nyeah and then zip ties are in here as\nwell or you can keep them\ninside your handlebars you know i once\nand i kid you not i once zip tied my\nchain ring back onto my bike\nafter all of the chainring bolts fell\nout 25 kilometers from home\nso there's two things to learn from that\nnumber one zip ties can do anything\nnumber two never get rupert to fix your\nbike\nwell i hope these tips will go some way\ntowards helping you get the most\nenjoyment out of your gravel riding\nbut if you do have any questions then do\nleave them in the comments section below\nand\njames will do his best to answer them\ni'm probably not best suited for that\nbut if you have any tips as well leave\nthem there too\nnow don't forget to like and subscribe\nto the cycling weekly youtube channel it\ndoes\nreally help us and we'll be back soon\nwith some more great content\nhere comes some boys one boy he's\nclipped in on both\nthat's what all the mountain bikers do\nis it yeah that's what i see\nshredders doing oh is it okay i'm not a\nshredder\nbetween the two wheels yeah that's right\nyeah\nit does yeah oh man i nailed it",

          "transcript": "how do you train for gravel racing and\nriding this is what we'll be discussing\ntoday\nas always we'll be looking at some\nscience but i'll also be getting into\nsome key workouts that i use to get\nready for long gravel races\nand while this video is gravel focused\nthe overall training principles that\ni'll be talking about apply to pretty\nmuch\nany discipline of cycling\nwelcome back to another video it seems\nlike gravel racing and riding is getting\nmore and more popular\nevery single day i myself have started\nto make the transition to\na full-on gravel racer and i know that a\nlot of you\nare in the same boat so i thought it was\nabout time that i make a video\ndedicated to gravel oh boy here we go\na whole video about gravel if you're new\nhere\nget ready for this kid to take up like\nhalf the video talking about his\nfrankly creepy obsession with his aero\nbars\na good place to start would be by\nanalyzing the demands of\na typical gravel race that way we can\nget a better idea of what we need to\nwork on in training\nby the way you should do this with\nanything that you're training for\nthe most popular gravel races right now\nare what i would classify as\nultra endurance events in that they\nrange from 100 to 200 miles\nor more now of course there are shorter\ngravel races and for more time crunch\nriders\nthese shorter races may be a better\noption\nand the workouts that i'm going to go\nover later in this video\ncan be scaled down to fit the length of\ngravel race that you're training for\ngravel events are also generally mass\nstart events\nat least they used to be and hopefully\nthey'll return that way\nsoon when i say mass start i mean that\neveryone from\npros to the last place finisher are all\nstarting in one wave\nthis makes for some very interesting\nrace tactics especially because\ndrafting does play a large role in\ngravel racing\nyou will likely have to go a bit harder\nthan what would normally be considered\noptimal pacing to get with a fast group\nwithin reason of course\ninteresting does a 1200 watt attack half\na mile into a 100 mile gravel race to\nstart my\n99 and a half mile solo breakaway to\nglory count\nas within reason nope ah\nwell i'll probably just do it anyway and\nuse that as my excuse later\nas a result most gravel races will be\npositively paced\nor if you're in it to win it or getting\ncompetitive with the riders around you\nand trying to beat them\nparabolically paced let me explain from\nthis review article on describing and\nunderstanding pacing strategies\npositive pacing means that speed\ngradually declines throughout the\nduration of the event\nso you're slowing down parabolic pacing\nis when you go harder at the beginning\nand\nat the end and slower in the middle it\ncan follow a u\nj or reverse j pattern depending on how\nhard the start is\nrelative to the finish if gravel racing\nwas just a long time trial then you\nwould want a more\neven pacing strategy but it's not so\none of these two pacing strategies is\nlikely inevitable\nand even preferred to take full\nadvantage of drafting\nthese two pacing strategies are\nsomething that you can train\nspecifically for\nand i recommend doing that in order to\nincrease your endurance\nspeaking of endurance these races are\ngoing to require a lot of it as they\noften cover\nsome massive distances but you don't\nwant to just be able to\ncover the distance you want to be able\nto cover the distance while putting out\ngood power at a relatively high\npercentage of your ftp\nthis is something that will also need to\nbe worked on you should also take into\naccount the elevation profile of the\nspecific race that you're training for\nfor example if you know that there are\nthree main climbs in the race that take\nroughly 30 minutes each then you're\ngonna want to develop your\n30 minute power and be able to repeat\nthat multiple times throughout a ride\nso we have a good idea of the demands of\nnow how do we design our training in\norder to meet those demands\nit's important to note that your\ntraining should be changing throughout\nthe course of a year\nbut for the sake of this video we'll\nassume that you've already done your\noff-season training\nand your base training and now we're\ngetting into specific training\nright before racing generally during\nthis period you're going to want to\nincrease your intensity and reduce your\nvolume\nto make way for that increased intensity\nresearch has been done\ninto reducing training load by reducing\nvolume and\nby reducing intensity and consistently\nresults show that fitness is maintained\nwhen\nvolume is reduced however when subjects\nreduced\ntraining intensity more fitness is lost\nand this method of reducing volume and\nincreasing intensity will likely work\nfor\nshorter gravel races however for longer\ngravel events\nyour training is actually becoming less\nspecific since\nyou're reducing your training volume for\na high volume event\nwe don't want this until the last one or\ntwo weeks before the event\nduring the taper this is why i generally\ngo the approach of\nincreasing training intensity while\nmaintaining volume\nfor long distance races you will\nsacrifice some training quality for\nthose high intensity days by doing this\nbut it will be worth it for the extra\nstamina late in the race\nwith this in mind let's lay out a\ntypical training week for a rider who\ntrains about 12 hours a week\nagain this is just an example and you\nmay need to train\nmore or less than this depending on your\nfitness level and a variety of other\nfactors\nand of course you can adjust this to fit\nyour own personal schedule\nyou generally want two recovery days in\nthe week these can either be completely\noff\nor you can do an active recovery ride\nfor no longer than an hour\nin this example week we have monday\ncompletely off and\nfriday as an active recovery day we then\nhave\ntwo high intensity days in the week this\nnumber is very important and is actually\nwhere most riders\nscrew up their training studies done on\ntraining intensity and duration\ndistribution\nfind that a high intensity frequency\ngreater than\ntwo or occasionally three days a week\ndoes not induce\nfurther improvements and in fact tend to\ninduce symptoms of\noverreaching and over training for\nexample this study on iron man\ntriathletes which found that more time\ntraining above the endurance zone\nactually contributed to\nslower race times and poorer overall\nperformance\nokay so we know we want two intensity\ndays in the week but what should these\ndays\nlook like i usually go with one general\nhigh intensity day and one\nspecific high intensity day from this\nstudy on specific intensity for peaking\nthey found that both specific and high\nintensity training\nincreased race pace equally and\nconcluded that the combination of\nboth high intensity training and\nspecific training\nmay lead to a higher training response\nthe general high intensity day is\nusually\nsome form of these three workouts 30 30s\nwhere you ride 30 seconds\nall out rest for 30 seconds and repeat\nvo2 max intervals which are\nfour or five minutes in length all out\nrepeated four or five times\nor eight minute intervals again all out\nrepeated four\nor five times the reason for these\nspecific sessions is because these\nworkouts have been shown to have some of\nthe highest training response\nin the literature for the general high\nintensity workout in the week i'm gonna\nput that on tuesday since that's gonna\nbe a shorter workout\nthis brings us to the specific day which\ni'll put on saturday because\nagain when training for this type of\nevent this day needs to not only be\nhigh in intensity but also high in\nhow do we go about doing this all often\nstack intervals at the beginning\nand the end of a long ride not only does\nthis make for a high quality long ride\nbut it also mimics the kind of effort\nthat you'll likely have to do on race\nday\nfor example let's take a day when we're\nworking on power at lactate threshold so\nintervals done around 95 to 100 of ftp\ngenerally during these days you're\nlooking to get in 30 minutes to an\nhour of intense work the fitter you are\nthe closer you want to get to that\nfull hour typically you might divide\nthis into three by 10 minutes 4 by 12\nminutes\nor 3 by 20 minutes just as examples with\nrest periods roughly half as long as the\ninterval period\nand then when you're done with your\ncooldown you might call it a day\nfor this workout though you're going to\nwant to split it up and do part of the\nworkout at the beginning of the ride and\npart of the workout at the\nend of the ride for example let's take 4\nby 12 minutes\nat 95 to 100 of ftp you may choose to do\nthree of the intervals at the beginning\nand one at the end\nor two at the beginning and two at the\nend or if you're feeling\nreally ambitious all four at the\nbeginning and then try for\na fifth one at the end doing these\nefforts late into the ride when you\naren't perfectly fresh\nwill prepare you for doing this on race\nday the time spent in between\nthese two interval sections in the\nworkout should just be zone 2\nendurance now it is important to\nremember that a lot of time during these\nevents\nis spent between zone 2 and your ftp\nso in order to tailor your training\ntowards the event\nyou're going to want to spend some time\nin this in-between zone\nthis can be dangerous and you have to do\nit strategically\nmost riders ride all of the time in this\nin-between gray zone\nand they're never really going easy\nwhich in turn means that they're never\nreally recovered enough\nto go really hard which is not optimal\ntraining\nall right mister i wear a heart rate\nmonitor when i take a dump in order to\nnot\nstrain myself above zone two most of us\nlive in the real world\nand have actual friends that we ride\nwith and every stop sign on\nevery ride is a potential sprint point\nand every slight incline\nis a point where we could either drop or\nget dropped\nso your methods are really just not that\npractical\nthis study on using different training\nmodels in trained cyclists had subjects\ncomplete a six-week training plan\nusing different training protocols one\ngroup spent\n80 percent of the time training at\nendurance zone or below\nno time training at sweet spot or tempo\nand 20\nof the time training at or above ftp\nthe other group spent 57 of the time at\nor below endurance\n43 of the time at sweet spot or tempo\nand no time above\nftp what they found was that the group\nthat did no sweet spot or tempo\nimproved their peak power outputs\nlactate threshold\nhigh intensity exercise capacity and 40k\ntt time more than the group that spent a\nsignificant amount of time\nat those in between zones just below ftp\nand these kinds of results are backed up\nby multiple reviews looking at many\nstudies coming to the same conclusion\nthese studies may lead one to believe\nthat sweet spot and tempo should be\navoided\nat all costs and for certain types of\nracers training for shorter events\ni would agree with this however if you\nstill\nload your schedule up with easy zone two\nriding\nand use sweet spot and tempo sparingly\nyou can see\ngreat results from it this is what is\nreferred to as pyramidal training\nand has been tested in studies like this\none that had a group\nsimilar to the previous study that\ncompletely avoided sweet spot and tempo\nand then another group that still did\nthe majority of their training at that\neasier endurance zone at 78 percent\nbut then spent the remaining time mostly\ndoing sweet spot and tempo work\nand what they found was no significant\ndifference between the two groups\nin competition times the pyramidal\napproach is what i would use for\nultra endurance races like long gravel\nraces\nthis means that your tempo and sweet\nspot days count as one of your two high\nintensity days in the week\nand as such you want to get the most out\nof them\nlet me show you some examples again we\nhave our high intensity tempo day on\nsaturday in this week\nand on this day we're shooting for an\nhour and a half of tempo on the low end\nand potentially as much as\nthree hours on the high end so for\nexample this might look like\nthree by 30 minutes at 85 to 90 percent\nof ftp\nor as much as four by 45 minutes at this\npace\nfor highly trained riders this sounds\nlike a lot but remember that on race day\nyou'll need to do\neven more time at this intensity and if\nyou're not doing it\nthree or four times a week like so many\nsweet spot coaches suggest\nthen you should be recovered enough to\ncomplete the workout\nand of course another great way to get\nin gravel-specific\nintensity before your a-race is to do a\nless important gravel race in the month\nleading into that race\nif you do this treat this as one of your\nhigh intensity days in the week\nthat's our intensity for the week now\nwhat do we do with the rest of the week\nagain current research into training\nintensity distributions\nsuggests that most of the time 80 or\nmore\nshould be spent below the first\nventilatory threshold or\nendurance zone in order to maximize\nresults\nyou want the rest of your week to be\ndone at or below zone 2 or roughly 75\nof your ftp there's no need to do any\nfancy intervals on these days or\nmake up for riding less hours by riding\nharder\njust enjoy your nice conversationally\npaced\nzone 2 ride not possible dude if i'm\never riding\nslow enough to have a conversation with\nyou\nthen i'm not going to be enjoying it in\nthis example week that gives us a\nshorter endurance ride on wednesday and\nthursday\nand a longer one on sunday to finish out\nthe week\nfinally if you've been lifting\nthroughout the season and want to\ncontinue\ninto the build season which i recommend\nwhere should you put your lifting\nsessions\nin this example week i'd place them on\nwednesday and saturday so that there's\nenough recovery time between\na lifting day and the next high\nintensity day during this period you're\ngoing to want to reduce the training\nload of your lifting sessions in order\nto make way for the higher intensity\nwork that you're doing on the bike\nand there's a number of ways that you\ncan do this you can reduce the total\nnumber of sets that you do when you go\ninto the gym\nyou can lift just one day a week instead\nof two times a week\nor you can reduce the amount of weight\nthat you lift with each set\ntwo more things to consider when\ntraining for gravel racing first\nride your gravel bike on gravel in\nthis seems obvious but a lot of riders\njust spend all their time training on\nthe road and then hop into a gravel race\nand while gravel isn't as technical as\nsay mountain bike racing it does take\nsome skill in order to navigate\ngravel corners potholes washboard roads\nsand mud etc at speed i'd say that in\nyour preparation for\na big gravel race you'll want a minimum\nof two days per week spent\noff-road also your nutrition is a very\nimportant part of long distance gravel\nracing\nand you don't want to be trying anything\nnew on race day you want to play with\nyour nutrition in training\nto make sure that it works for you\nparticularly on those long\nhigh intensity days this will also get\nyour gut used to consuming this level of\ncarbohydrates while you're riding\nwhich is important from this article on\ntraining the gut for athletes it is\nclear that nutritional training can\nimprove gastric emptying and absorption\nlikely reduce the chances and or\nseverity of\ngi problems thereby improving endurance\nas well as providing a better experience\nfor the athlete\nwhen experimenting with your nutrition\nthere are two things that you want to\nlook for bonking\nand gut issues if you're bonking that\nmeans that you're not consuming enough\ncarbohydrates\nif you're having gut issues then it\ncould mean a number of things including\nhow much sodium you're taking in but it\ncould also mean that you're consuming\ntoo much food while you're riding\nyou want to consume enough calories so\nthat you don't bonk but not\nso much that you start to develop gi\nissues\nfor more information on cycling\nnutrition check out the video that i did\non it\nlinked down in the description below\nthanks for watching if you enjoyed this\nvideo be sure to give it a like\nsubscribe for weekly

          "transcript": "Ted King we're here in your home state\nof New Hampshire that's right welcome to\ntown that's so great to be here and I\ncouldn't think of a better place to be\nwhere the asphalt ends in the dirt road\nbegins I love it it is the story of your\ncareer I think I think I think there's\nsome truth to that Ted King is a retired\nPro Tour racer who famously shepherded\nPeters segond to wins all over the world\nwhen they race together he now is a pro\ngravel racer he's won the dirty cans of\n200 Weis while we were here I had to\ncook up with him and get some tips on\nhow to ride gravel like a king it's fun\nbecause you don't have to count calories\nlike I did in a previous lifetime\nyou want to be sure that you are on top\nof hydration and nutrition you're\nputting in 250 to 300 calories per hour\nI don't want to die up here and and then\nI realized that all the guys have kids\nor have families and they don't want to\ndie either\n[Music]\nTed thank you so much for taking us out\non your local roads this is amazing\nsuper pretty right now with all the\nfoliage voyages kickin we call this peak\nyeah it is it's super peak I mean I'm\nnot far away in Massachusetts talking\nabout that for a second both being New\nEnglanders yeah buddy not from England\nlike many people on the show but from\nNew England it's pretty cool to be out\nhere\nwe're practically born for gravel\nthere's so many dirt roads I I\ncompletely agree I mean it's super cool\nright now living in Vermont where there\nare literally more dirt roads and there\nare paved yeah it's a blessing yeah so\nwe're here for your ride which is the\nwhich is the King challenge so we\nbenefit the crippled Center the crippled\nCenter is a 19 year old operation\nstarted by David crumbles but it is it\nis a organization that benefits those\nwith acquired brain injury so often from\nfrom trauma or stroke or tumor so my dad\nhad a stroke in 2003 and he's been a\nmember of this community and in effect\nit's where you go once you have passed\nall the therapies so it really is you\nknow in cycling we love community and\nthat is that's what the Center\nis all about couldn't help but obviously\nfor nine years I've been wanting to come\nout always as falls during cross season\nit is easy to come out and I thought\nthis year we're coming out and we're\ngonna do a video not only cuz we've been\ntalking a lot about gravel on GCN and\nall the you know all the like when we\nstarted doing this these bikes were not\nat all designed for what we're doing but\nnow these bikes are like these bikes are\nmade for this type of stuff I just\nwanted to pick your brain on it give the\npeople some tips from well I said last\nbefore but a king of gravel you done\nsome pretty long event let's talk about\nsome of the some of the events that\nyou've done yes sir\ndirty Kansa is one that's on my mind\nthat is friendly that doesn't know 200\nkilometers long 200 miles my friend I'm\nsorry 200 miles long sector 200 miles\nlong yes let's talk about that for a\nsecond oh yeah\nhow is that different than say like a a\nPerry Roubaix or like a Grand Tour stage\nI was DK different than that so 2016\nthere I am my first year of retirement\nfrom road racing and on a whim I was\nasked to do dirty Kansa and I knew I had\na handful of characteristics that would\nsuit me I know how to ride long distance\nI know how to ride on rough terrain I\nknow how to do a bunch of things but you\ndon't collectively know how it all comes\ntogether like something like DK so you\nknow I went in as best prepared I could\nbut all of a sudden your self support is\nit's not the world of the world tour\nanymore how does it compare well let's\nsay the obvious ones it's a longer\neffort than any Grand Tour stage it's a\nlonger effort than Perry Roubaix you're\nyou're you got to go into it expecting\nto do at least a 10 hour day it's\ntotally erased of attrition being self\nsupported is a really cool attribute of\na lot of these gravel races how are you\npreparing for that obviously we know\nthat you own a nutrition company oh but\nwhat is what is it like to prepare for a\n10 plus hour race nutritionally let's\ntalk about it's fun because you don't\nhave to count calories like I did in the\nprevious lifetime you're counting as\nmany calories as you can possibly take\nin yeah I mean over the course of a 10\nplus hour day you want to be sure that\nyou are on top of hydration and\nnutrition you're putting in 250 to 300\ncalories per hour for at least 10 hours\nit is brutally hot in in Kansas in early\nJune so you got to be on top of your\nhydration Oh drinking at least a bottle\nan hour off enough one to two bottles\nper hour so yeah things that you can't\nhave a hiccup or else you're gonna find\nyourself on your back foot at you know\nour six shirt with many many many more\nhours to go what I really like to\nemphasize is eating real foods to be\nhonest I mean I think there's nothing\nbetter than going on a sweet ride and\nlinking it together with a copy shop go\neat like a brownie a muffin a cookie a\nscone yeah I have chokes down too many\npieces of sports injures in my life to\nreally have any desire to do that\nanymore hydration I definitely say drink\ndrink drink and then when you think you\nneed to drink some more definitely drink\nsome more I mean electrolytes are key\nthat is a way to to really maximize your\nhydration if you're in a pinch and you\ndon't have them handy water is gonna be\nbetter than nothing but a lot of these\ngrowler races are in the heat of the\nsummer they're in the heat of humidity\nand you are you are expelling a absurd\namount of fluids so you got to be ahead\nof the food what what about when you get\ninto the race you're at a you're at the\nmile 75 there's a rest stop with water\nwhat is the protocol is it gentlemen's\nagreement everyone pulls off to the side\nand grabs water does someone keep going\nyou guys all look sideways and you like\nhunt that person down I didn't stop\nbecause you guys you guys can't you guys\ncan't hold 200 miles worth of water on\nyour bike correct you know that's a\nreally interesting question that is that\nis what we see in this changing state of\ngravel\nI like the races that that you find\nyourself in the right group and then you\ncan have that agreement to say guys\nwe're gonna stop here right you know\nyour headsets loose I got a P and Steve\nhere the left needs to grab some water\nlike as long as you have that good-good\ncommunity you don't want somebody to\nhave a bad day as a result of mechanical\nas a result of not being hydrated so you\nwant guys that you guys want you got\nlong guys to win with their legs exact\nhydration is a tough one minutes in the\nmiddle of that it is so right I mean you\nwant to also be smart be aware be be\naware where the feed zones are be aware\nof the distances that you're gonna have\nto go between feed zones so you've\nreally made a self name for yourself\nafter the Pro Tour now coming into\ngravel it's booming it's literally\nbooming in the US at least and globally\nI mean you were doing a race in Iceland\nyep yes my Deborah's saying how long was\nthat one that was I was 200 K so 120\nmiles desolate we literally raced out\nfrom on already desolate town it raced\naround the volcano called heck la was it\ncold there it was not cold it was it was\nlate July it was windy kind of like\ntoday it was overcast was raining it was\nsnowing it was sleeting we literally saw\neverything over the course of the day we\nhad all her go over for GCN and he did\nit yeah and I think it was I think it\nwas a bit challenging for him not being\na gravel star that was a doozy of a race\nhe had a lot of things to say about it\nwould you consider yourself to be into\nthe kind of the nasty conditions like\nthe bad stuff yeah I mean honestly going\ninto decay this year for example this is\nthe first year we see a lot of World\nTour guys coming over from yep and track\nand and I was really looking forward to\nthe crap weather because I thought it\nbecomes a big mental game as much as\nanything yeah and I figure you know if\nit's pouring rain the mud is turning the\npeanut butter and it's very cyclocross\nof you oh my lord right thank you I\nappreciate it's a good it's a good Amish\nto New England crappy weather what I\ntell a lot of people a lot of friends\nworld tour buddies who are getting into\nit I say at some point over the course\nof day you're gonna be in a very very\ndark place yeah\nso you just have to anticipate that you\nalso have to anticipate random stop\nsigns and stuff like that yeah\nlet's talk about your machine here\nwe got a Cannondale synapse this is this\nis effectively Cannon Dale's\ncobble blank so this is the bike the\nracing the spring Classic what's funny\nabout gravel is it's it's often one bike\nfits all but then you know you can\nreally nerd out on the nuances and\nthat's what I have the privilege to do\nso tomorrow for example is largely a\nroad ride with a little bit of very tame\ngravel so a bike like this is is largely\nmeant for four pave and traditional\npaved roads this is also the identical\nbike this is the bike that I want spt\ngravel on so going to an event like that\n140 miles long I know it's going to be a\nwhole lot of gravel of a variety of\ntypes but overall it's tame so you know\nyou don't need a knobby tire with what\nwe have going on here it's a pretty\ntraditional gear ratio to buy upfront 11\nspeed in the rear whereas the gnarlier\ngravel races you're gonna want to have a\nlot of tread on the tire you're gonna\nwant perhaps even bigger or easier gear\nratios and that's where you might go\nwith as we call it mullet protocol\nmullet protocol is business up front\nparty in the rear so one by 44 to front\neagle in the back 1050 gearing so you\ncan just spin up on up anything Iceland\nis a perfect example that where you're\ngonna have a lot of short steep pitches\nso you know save exactly volcano ash you\nwant to save your legs over the course\nof the day so spin to win I've always\nbeen a high cadence kind of guy what\nabout what about tires what are you\ndoing for tires this these you said\nthese were 32s but these look pretty big\nto me\nthese if I said 32 I misspoke these are\nactually 35 which is super cool that you\ncan fit this on a traditional road bike\nyeah so tubeless 35 seat tires these are\nby the good folks at Renee hearse when\nwould you say like okay I need to get a\nknobby ER tire or a semi slick there's\nevery kind of tire that you could\nimagine right now that is the truth\nthat's probably the number one question\nI get when I am going to an event Ted\nwhat pressure you running what tire you\ngonna run how how slick is it how knobby\nis it given that these tires are\ntubeless and virtually all tires that\nI'm doing to grab\nour tubeless you get so much grip just\nby running lower pressure so slicks are\nawesome in in most events so long as it\nis dry once you know there's gonna be\neither some wet or muddy or a little bit\ngnarly ER conditions that's we're gonna\ngo with a knobby ER tire you you ride\nthe tire that matches the condition in\ntheory right if you know it's gonna be\nsuper muddy you're thinking okay I\nbetter ride this tire but it's not gonna\nbe as efficient so it is always that\nkind of like that seesaw like I do I\ngive a little here because it's gonna be\nslower if I push it but it's gonna be\nit's gonna be a lot safer because\nthere's tons of big rocks all that stuff\nI agree you're going over super long\ndistances so there's typically not a ton\nof cornering I mean yeah gravel events\ncan be twenty miles they could be 220\nmiles in these shorter events that's\nwhere they might get a lot more\ntechnical and that's where you're gonna\nwant to have some some chunk on your\ntire some knob on your tire yeah but I\nthink there's often a lot of over\nanalysis that goes into tire I think\nhaving a tire with tread when you're\ngonna need to do a more technical ride\nthat's great and then on more\nstraightforward rides like people look\nat this all the time thing is that gonna\nbe enough and I say absolutely\nespecially that lower pressure yeah I am\na huge proponent of tubeless in gravel\nyou want to have some good sealant in\nthere I've been riding with what do you\ncall these things plugs yes that's a new\nattribute to my repertoire that I have\nand so tell me about what happens with a\nplug you're riding along you've got the\nceilings going everywhere but your\nceiling supposed to seal it every once\nin a while you're gonna hit something\nthat is gonna be bigger than what\nsealant can seal so you quickly pull the\nside of the road you I highly recommend\nyou have your plug in your back pocket\nready to go pull it right out boom stick\nit into the hole and then hopefully that\nplug is gonna seal your your malady what\nyou want to remember is as you stick the\nplug in and it continues to leak air why\ndon't you flip that tire over so the\nsealant can seal with this now a plugged\nhole well get going again while we're on\ntopic yeah important to have your co2 s\nhandy because you probably lost some air\nat that point yep but he\nlet's go through the contents of my\nsaddlebag you got a tube you got your\nplug you got tire levers you got a tool\nand I don't know a little bit more co2\njust in case you got a gas up the old\njet alright so let's talk about petals\nbecause I've seen you at different\ngravel events sometimes you're riding\nroad pedals sometimes you're riding\nmountain bike pedals this is a somewhere\nin the middle what makes you pick one\nversus the other\nso what we got going on here is a speed\nplay pave pedal this is a pedal that\nspeed play created for for the gnarly\nfields of northern Belgium basically if\nyou're gonna be getting off your bike to\navoid a crash or something when you're\nracing through Belgium and you need to\nstep off your bike into stuff exactly\nlike this you can re-engage so this is\nan opportunity for a gravel race when\nyou don't anticipate getting off your\nbike for more than about two steps but\nbeyond that if you know that there's a\nriver crossing if you know there is\ngoing to be a whole lot of mud or really\naverse terrain that's when a mountain\nbike pedal is going to be more in your\nwheelhouse got it\nany sort of running event of something\nsteep I don't know running is part of\nyour former cycling repertoire running\nis hard so I don't do a whole lot of\nthat but in those events I know that I\nwant to be reaching for a mountain bike\npedal\nyou also did a ride called that you\ncalled the James Bay descent that is\ncorrect what was the temperature of that\nthe world\nconveniently negative 40 is where\nFahrenheit and Celsius overlap and on\nday one it was negative 40 degrees that\nis a vicious vicious cold that was also\nthe day that I got frostbite on my nose\nand I realize that you can't let your\nnose or any skin be exposed for that\nmatter oh gosh wait hang on bring it so\nwhat did you wear you know that turns\nout your body is something of a furnace\nso as you're riding you wear very very\nlittle I would wear a nice blow geo\nshell with a thermal long sleeve under\nthat but could be told so long as you're\nmoving you're producing so much heat is\nnot until you stop that two down jackets\nwould go on none of a sudden you're like\nokay now it's time to not freeze do that\nseven days long 7 days and it was how\nlong was it six hundred kilometers five\nhundred K okay but when you're riding a\nfat bike in your max speed is somewhere\naround 10 K an hour it takes a really\nreally long time it was gnarly it opened\nmy eyes up to bike packing - what\nnegative 40 degrees feels like what's it\nlike to be in polar bear country Laura\nreally really wants me to come home from\nthis trip I don't want to die up here\nand and then I realize that all the guys\nhave kids or have families and they\ndon't want to die either in that type of\nenvironment what do you eat because it\nseems like everything would either be\nfrozen or it'd be like astronaut food\nyes well you actually do do that that's\nso we can work backwards from there\ndinner is camping meals where you have a\nbag and you pour boiling water in it and\nand that is your meal and turns out the\nthree cheese macaroni is delicious you\nknow you are fueling throughout the day\nyou're riding throwing in a whole lot of\nsugar a whole lot of carbohydrate so a\nlot of untapped maple syrup cookies\ntrail mix chocolate peanut butter and\nthat peanut butter would begin to get a\nlittle bit frozen so you put that under\nyour under your jacket you got you got\nto create your own water so your boiling\nwater in the beginning the day you're\nyou're making coffee with with that hot\nwater you got your oatmeal in the\nmorning\nit's how do you freedom entry living how\ndid you keep your water from freezing\nyou have really nicely insulated bottles\nthat if you fill them up I think they're\nabout yay big then you're gonna get as\nsoon as they are beginning to freeze\nthat is when there you basically run\nthem dry and then by then it's basically\nthe end of the day and you're you're\nready to set up camp a knob camera you\nwere joking that or maybe it was on\ncamera you were joking that you're gonna\ndo it again the crazy guys are gonna do\nit again the invitation has gone out\ncoincidentally they're thinking of doing\nit in March and March is when my wife is\ndue with our first child that's a I\nprobably won't be going on that's a\nblessing yes and a couple different\nfries exactly exactly\n[Applause]\nthat is some travel tips with the king\nTed thank you very much for your time\ntoday if

          "transcript": "hey I'm Katie I live in San Francisco I\nride and race with or not\nI ride all the bikes and I race some of\nthose too I started riding dirt probably\nabout five years ago and one of things I\nlike about riding dirt is that you're\nthere's always more to learn there we go\nhello I am Jake I love dogs especially\nthis one here and over the past like\nalmost decade I just kind of explored\nthe marine trails and found them with\ndirt we're here to kind of impart any\nknowledge we can help you guys with and\nhope you enjoy it\nwelcome to kukuku trail so a couple\nthings are really important for steep\nclimbs that I think are a little bit\ncounterintuitive and the main thing is\nthat when you're on a climb like this\nthat's like I don't know agreed this is\n15-20 percent you need to scoot your\nwhole body forward on your bike you're\non your hoods but you're kind of perched\nabove them and the most important thing\nthat you're trying to do bring your\nweight forward because one of the\nbiggest reasons you're gonna have to\nditch on the steep climb is because your\nfront wheel starts waggling so one thing\nI really try to encourage people that\nare switching in a dirt is to think\nabout your bike and your body has two\nseparate kind of entities you are in a\ndance with your bike and just like any\ngood dance partner sometimes you let\nyour bike lead sometimes you lead the\nmore you try to exert control over your\nbike the more things will go poorly\nsometimes you just need to let your bike\nkind of lead and do its thing these are\nmy absolute favorite tires of all time\nthe Victoria mess calls I really love it\nbecause as I ride out of the city from\nmy house across the Golden Gate Bridge I\nhave a really consistent Center tire\ntread pattern so I'm not dealing with\nlike crazy lugs that slow me down\nwhen you pick tires you don't think most\nabout what you're gonna be riding I ride\na lot of Road mixed in with hard pack\nand some loose stuff so I pick a tire\nthat's pretty wide but has a pretty\nsmooth center section and then a little\nbit of knob on\nside one of the most important things\nyou can do for yourself is to get your\nbraking done or most of your breaking\ndown before you hit the corner and\nyou're slow\nexit fast second you're out it's pedal\npedal pedal and get out of that corner\nfast and you'll maintain much more speed\noverall I do this in two ways I have\nstuff in my bike wallet and that way\nit's with me all the time no matter what\nride I'm on and then I have specific\nstuff in each bikes saddlebag and here\nI've got lever tire and then buried\nunder there I've got co2 and it Chuck\nand I have also with me at all times a\npump and additionally I keep a patch kit\nmulti-tool oh I've got a valve valve\ncore singer and then I've got Dyna plugs\noh I have my house keys I thought I\nforgot I'm not exciting\nsafety pins hair tied credit card cash\nand my driver's license choosing a line\nit's generally something you do you're\nkind of always visualizing you're always\nplanning ahead some surfaces are really\nawesome for climbing some are really not\noften what I'm definitely trying to\navoid is stuff where like your tire is\njust gonna struggle you're gonna spin\nout this kind of surface I remember a\nlot when I was first doing this grabbing\na lot of rear brake because I was\nfreaked out and wanted to slow down and\nthen your rear end starts chef fishtail\nso there's two things that you want to\ndo here number one keep your weight back\nso that no matter what happens you can\nadjust to it and number two grab front\nand rear evenly if you are finding\nyourself in trouble in some way like you\nhave too much speed or something's not\ngoing right the best thing you can do\nagain going back to this whole dance\nanalogy is just to stay very loose very\ncalm the second you freak out the second\nyou scrab your brakes you're gonna go\ndown or you're gonna like absorb a bump\nthrough your whole body\nyou'll get bucked off the question is\none by verse to buy if you had no\nfreaking idea what I'm talking\none buy is what I have on this bike it\nmeans you have one chain ring in the\nfront a lot of bikes in the past like\nsay from four years ago working\nbackwards had two trainings or even\nbefore that three I really like the one\nbuy because it keeps things simple it's\nless tough to break it's less weight you\njust have a lot less chain slot there's\nsomething called a clutch on the back of\nthis derailleur which is super stiff\nwhich just helps the bike from just\nkeeping the chain tension really strong\nnumber one these are your hoods because\nI have relatively small hands and I have\nrelatively big hoods on this bike I\nactually do most of my riding in general\nin my hoods I tend to only get in my\ndrops when in case you don't know what\npoison hook looks like I'm standing next\nto a bunch of lovely beautiful boys note\nvery very oily\nyou can usually distinguish it because\nit's quite shiny that's all these awful\noils you do not want to get on either\nyour body or your bike very very very\nhard to start because it's often loose\nit's super steep what I personally like\nto do is to angle my bike on a 45 I clip\nin whatever kind of whatever my\npreference photos for me it's my left\nand then this way you're sitting you can\nget traction into your back wheel\ntic-tac my way up to climb we preferred\nto list you flat a lot less often when\nyou do flat you've got this hope that\nit'll seal up for you and all you have\nto do is add air or maybe you don't even\nhave to do that the number one reason to\nrun to bliss though is that you can run\nlower pressure and you can run lower\npressure without\n650b references your tire diameter so\nit's basically the height of your rim I\nreally love 650b because basically as\nyou can see especially in the back of my\nbike you can fit essentially a slightly\nwider tire into a frame then you can\n700-seat ultimately the circumference of\nyour tire is about the same between 650\nand 700 C it's kind of like you're just\ntrading rim for air I think it's\nimportant to say like at a basic level\nyou only need a couple things you need a\nbike that fits you a bike you can afford\nand then when it comes to dirt and\ngravel specifically you want to be that\nclear is like pretty big tires I would\nsay like forty twos would be a good\nstarting point so that you can\ncomfortably run 40s plus or minus and\nthen you want hydraulic disc brakes\nbecause it just makes such a big\ndifference on your descending there is\nan organization here in Marin called\nMarin County bike coalition they're\nphenomenal they have a trail map that\nyou can either get as a PDF they also\nwhen you become a member they send you\none like a physical copy it's a trail\nmap of every bike legal trail in Marin\nfrom the Golden Gate Bridge all the way\nup to Point Reyes player a station trail\netiquette some basic things about trail\netiquette it's about being a nice person\nand it's about being aware of the effect\nthat your riding has on other people and\nvice versa and if you are the uphill\nrider you have right away if you're the\ndownhill rider you don't have\nright-of-way yield to walkers\npedestrians anyone that you need to\nyield to to maintain a safe circumstance\ncall out if you're gonna pass ding your\nbell and say something nice\nthink of your entire ride as like one\nkind of Dancy experience it can be\nriding to the trails it can be anywhere\nyou can just always be kind of messing\naround even in the city even on the\ntrails\nwhatever I've been doing especially in\nquarantine a ton of yoga and just\nthinking a lot about breathing and I\njust brought\nmy yoga breathing techniques and also\ntechniques I use in climbing to riding I\njust found that as you take really deep\nlong breaths and let them like let it\nkind of fill your body especially like\nyour lungs the your back\nI felt way calmer I felt way more poised\nI felt like I had a lot more ability to\nlike think rationally and I ultimately\nrode better it really just helps not\nonly to riding but the entire experience\nof what it's like to be out in this\nbeautiful place\nyou",

        "search_text": "These transcripts provide general gravel riding advice rather than specific information about the Essential Gravel race in Ringle, Wisconsin. Riders emphasize the importance of tire selection, with Victoria Mezcal tires recommended for mixed terrain riding from road to hard pack. Tire pressure requires experimentation starting from manufacturer recommendations, adjusting by 1-2 psi increments to balance traction, comfort and rolling resistance. For steep climbs, riders should move their body weight forward to prevent front wheel wandering. Descending technique involves keeping weight back and using front and rear brakes evenly to avoid rear wheel fishtailing. Nutrition strategy calls for 250-300 calories per hour on long events. The mental approach treats bike and rider as dance partners, sometimes letting the bike lead rather than over-controlling. Essential gear includes repair supplies distributed between bike wallet and saddlebag systems. Line choice focuses on avoiding surfaces where tires will struggle and spin out. The transcripts emphasize gravel riding as a continuous learning process requiring adaptation to varied terrain conditions."
