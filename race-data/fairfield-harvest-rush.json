          "transcript": "well welcome everyone to another episode\nof the Ia gravel series Podium podcast\nmy name is Chris McQueen and guess what\nwe have an amazing guest for you today\nwe've got Gabe hobi he took second in\nthe 100K at Fairfield the Fairfield\nHarvest rush in 2024 and uh honestly I\ndon't know any about Gabe but we're\ngoing to learn a few things here today\nactually that's not completely true we\ngot talking just a little bit before we\nstarted and uh sounds like we have a lot\nin common so I'm uh looking forward to\nuh to learning more Gabe so good to have\nyou on the podcast yeah thanks for\nhaving me so Gabe um we uh we talked a\nlittle bit uh ahead of time about how\nyou know went to school for mechanical\nengineering we've got uh uh you're in\nCedar Rapids now and everything but\nreally what everybody's always curious\nabout is how did you get into\ncycling uh it's a I don't know it's not\nthat interesting of a story but I guess\nif you want to go way back I guess in\nlike high school like that kind of time\nperiod I did a lot of like running cross\ncountry track that was kind of my jam I\nwasn't like anything crazy but I was\nokay and then uh through a couple\ninjuries plus covid and everything it\nkind of fell away from the whole running\nthing started lifting a whole bunch and\ngot really good at that I guess you\ncould say so I did that for a while in\ncollege and then after a while I was\nlike man I can lift a lot of weight but\nI am really out of shape and so a couple\nof my good buddies in college were both\nlike big mountain bikers and I went to\nschool in Rapid City in South Dakota so\nthere's some like pretty Primo mountain\nbiking out there so I was like what the\nheck I'll get one of these and try this\nout so got one of those and then lo and\nbehold I was kind of hooked\ninstantly so then I started biking a\nbunch and then one of those buddies got\nme to sign up for a race in Spearfish\nSouth Dakota called the Dakota 5 yeah\nthat is a big yeah that is a big race I\nknow a lot of folks that love uh have\nloved that one I haven't done it I've\ndone the the half marathon down the\ncanyon okay y um but yeah keep keep\ngoing so so you do ST which is I mean\nspear ship Spearfish is that's not a\nsmall amount of cross country climbing\non a mountain bike yeah yeah it was\npretty rough I didn't so that was like\nthe first race I ever did I rode\nbasically that whole summer uh in I had\na internship in sou Fall South Dakota so\nlike not a bunch of crazy climbing or\nanything like that but I got quite a bit\nbetter at just like bike handling and\neverything and then yeah the 5 is like\nthe first actual race I did and I didn't\nknow anything about like I mean like I\ngot tips from my buddies and whatever\nbut I didn't listen enough so I like way\nunder fueled way under hydrated it was\nsuper hot and I don't think I've ever\ncramped up that bad to my life it was\nterrible but yeah so I made it through\nthat and then\nuh fast forward a few months or whatever\ngraduated and got a job at colins\nAerospace out here in Iowa in Cedar\nRapids and while there's not as much\nmountain biking out here and it seems\nlike gravel biking was the thing to do\nso I got one of those now and well now\nhere we\nare well here we are indeed it's it's\ntrue because I you know I grew up out\nwest and I mean this was literally 25\nyears ago in terms of like mountain\nbiking uh out west and this was you know\nsuspension was expensive and and things\nwere tricky like that so um I think one\nof the things that I love about cycling\nis that wherever you are you can find\nthe right kind of bike to ride that kind\nof terrain that is around there and you\njust you know you just find the right\nstuff that fits and so if you're in\nspirit fish or that area then you know\nyou get yourself a great mountain bike\nand enjoy the the single track and then\nif you if you're in uh if you're in Iowa\nabsolutely gravel bike's the the right\nthing can I ask what you\nride yeah right now I ride a cell as\nSparrow but I'm on the outlook for\nsomething with a little more Tire\nclearance because that's the big thing\nnow what do you think like how much\nclearance are you you kind of aiming for\nuh I mean I'd like to be able to fit\nlike like the 2.1 like Thunderbirds or\nlike the 2.2 race Kings but but I don't\nknow for Iowa gravel it's probably not\nthat important to have a tire that big\nbut I'd like the option just for I don't\nknow if I get adventurous and do\nsomething crazy like Unbound or\nsomething like that someday yeah well I\nmean you're you're a trained mechanical\nengineer so we're gonna we can get into\nsome geeky stuff here right so what what\nis your theory what yeah what what is it\nthat that you find that you're you're\nlacking in that you think those bigger\ntires are are going to help you with\nwhat what are you noticing most yeah I\nmean like on the rough courses like if\nit's really chunky gravel and stuff like\nthat like it the more you think about it\nthe more makes sense and I mean the\nresearch is starting to show it too\nbased on what I've watched and read of\nlike you get a big tire a it's easier to\nnot flat which is huge I've experienced\nthat somehow in Iowa even and then uh\njust like yeah if you got all that tire\nyou can soak up a lot of the stuff\ninstead of having to have like\nsuspension and stuff to do all that you\ncan just do with Tire if it's not\nanything like super crazy yeah yeah also\nlike definitely slower on like a road or\nsomething too\nso win some some right it's finding that\nright balance for your for your terrain\nand find the right tire that you know\nhas enough has has the right enough of\nlike squish in it for the the chunky\nstuff and then being able to either put\nsomething else on it some other Tire\nor whatever when you're when you know\nyou're going to be on the smooth stuff\num I uh I love uh I think CLL is a\nfantastic brand that make uh great great\nstuff um I still am eying the uh um\nSanta Cruz Stigmata and the new newer\nones there I really like the geometry on\nthe the Stigmata um so but there's\nthere's so there's so many options yeah\nthere's too many\ndo you H do you have a big so we're at\nthe end of the season you know it's\nDecember right now when we're talking uh\nhave you have you kind of plotted out\nmaybe your season for next year or are\nyou looking at any big\nraces yeah I mean a little bit I guess I\nhaven't told you this yet but I broke my\nwrist not long after\nFairfield so I mean that's kind of the\nfirst one on the menu is get that fully\nrehabbed and back into shape or whatever\nand then try to work my fitness back\ninto reality too yeah so I gotta take\ncare of that first but is there a story\nbehind the wrist uh I don't not anything\nspecial I just really goofed up on a\nmountain bike pretty\ngood over the bars and the classic oh\nno well for those not on those listening\nto this at home got a pretty nasty scar\nlooks like it's maybe two to three\ninches long kind of down your left uh\nwrist kind of next to your carpal tunnel\nyou know that that area and uh but no\ncast or anything right now so are are\nyou able to put pressure on it did it\nrequire pins and things or are you uh\nlike how where are you on the healing\npath uh so on shoot what was that Monday\nMonday I got off like I got out of the\nsplint and everything so now I'm just\nlike I don't know trying to regain\nstrength and stuff but yeah they put so\nI\nlike split in a couple ways the distal\nradius that's like the big bone The\nJoint of it in your wrist so I split\nthat all apart and they put a like a t\nshaped plate and like eight screws in\nthere so it's that's a lot of screws for\na very small area yeah that's what I\nthought\ntoo and it felt like it after the next\nday too oh jez but no it's getting a lot\nbetter now I think I'm on the road to\nrecovery for sure can you put pressure\non it like if you're can you can you you\nbe in the handlebars and be fine or is\nit or is it still\nuncomfortable uh it's still pretty\nuncomfortable but I think like give it\nanother couple weeks and I probably\ncould I got I got a pair of Arrow bars\nfor my trainer so I got those sitting in\nthose for now until it kind of comes\nback to life I mean that's a that's\ngreat practice for hip flexibility and\nyou know if you're getting more in that\nArrow position everything like that I\nmean the only way to good at is to spend\na lot of time in that Arrow position\nright yeah maybe it'll make me more\nArrow next year or\nsomething well you're so you're you're\nkind of you're on the younger end of\nyour career your early career you know\njust out of college uh sort of thing um\nhow uh is is it pretty easy for you to\nkind of bounce back out of a injury like\nthis or do you find it hard to to still\nkind of like like where where's your\nmental space when it comes to injury\nlike\nthis uh to be honest for the like first\nmonth month and a half here it's been\npretty not a great mental space but\nit'll come around here eventually I'm\nstarting to actually be able to do stuff\nagain which really improves your mood a\nton so but yeah no I think in the moment\nyou know it always feels like forever\nuntil you can get back to it but when\nyou look back at it it's it's not too\nbad yeah I think this is one of the\nharder things things like I I do I do\nnotice even for myself and I'm a little\nbit farther down the road but not too\nfar um the uh usually when I am in a bad\nplace if I can just go knock something\noff my to-do list it's amazing how how\nrejuvenating that can be and and\nsometimes it's the hardest thing it's\njust to knock that one thing off your\nlist but then you do and then you're\nlike okay I can do stuff and then it\nthen it kind of cast skates from there\num cycling's good for that just teach\nyou it's like keep pedaling man it'll\nit'll work out keep pedaling yeah for\nsure so you mentioned that at the spear\nsorry Spearfish uh fif uh 50 uh you you\nhave a few lessons that you learn in\nthat process from hydration and\nnutrition and everything uh can you tell\nme a little bit about like what you're\ndoing now for nutrition what's kind of\nyour focus on the bike like when you go\ninto a you know you did the the 100K a\n60 mile race what what are some of the\nthings that thinking about and doing as\nyou uh as you fuel up for that\nrace yeah uh I mean I'm still learning\nfor sure like Fairfield was the what\nsecond gravel race I've ever done so I\nmean I'm still learning for sure but\nyeah just I've started doing the like\nlike carbs in your bottle and so like\nthe drink mixes and stuff like that uh\nI'm not a big fan of gels I know like a\nton of people use those all the time but\nI I don't know I just don't like them at\nall so I I don't know I get my carbs in\nin other ways like little uh those\nlittle fig bars and stuff I know it's\nnot like the best like instant carb fuel\nbut it gets the job done stuff like that\nand then yeah just drinking in the\nbottles I like to wear a hydration pack\nbecause it's just super easy to drink\nthat way like say like Fairfield there\nwas B- Road after B Road after B Road\nafter B Road and like\nfor the first like three quarters of\nthem like every time we hit a B- Road\nsomebody would just attack and like Let\nit Loose so you're just hanging on for\ndear life if you're trying to take a\ndrink out of your bottle at that time\nlike at least at my skill level you're\ndone yeah I'm really a big fan of the\nhydration pack for sure well and you\nmentioned Fairfield everything like uh\nso you for the\n100K um what was it like uh going out do\nyou do you remember much from the race\nin terms of like uh the group that you\nwere in and and or if there was any\ngroup or like maybe take us back to\nFairfield what was your experience uh in\nthat race yeah it was honestly super fun\nfor one I went into it with like zero\nexpectation like I'm still new to all\nthis I'm not I haven't been\nlike strategically training or anything\nlike that I've been just kind of like\nriding for fun and whatever but like OB\nobviously like I'm competitive so I'm\ngoing to go hard if I'm going to show up\nbut but yeah so my whole goal was just\nlike whatever front pack forms I'm just\ngonna go with them and then hang on for\nas long as I can if I get dropped I get\ndropped oh well and then so that's\nbasically exactly what I did just there\nwas a huge group at the like very start\nthat didn't last super long basically as\nsoon as we hit the first B- Road like uh\nshoot what's his name Wilson the oh c\nCaleb Wilson yeah yeah him and his whole\ncrew they just started taking off and I\nwas like well here it\ngoes so yeah I just hung on with them\nthrough all the B- roads and then\neventually oh it's probably like 15\nmiles to go maybe 10 miles to go\nsomething like that I think probably\nlike 15 miles to go uh Conrad Shannon if\nyou know him he's from this Cedar Rapids\nMarion Area too he W but he just like\ntook off off the front and no one else\nlike tried to catch him or what like\ntried to follow I was like well I told\nmyself I was gonna hang on as long as I\ncould so I tried to go follow him failed\nso I just dropped back into the group\nand rode in with them and then all this\nwas like 10 miles well maybe not even\nmaybe like five miles from the end I\nflatted did somehow I don't know how but\nI managed to flat and fixed it like\ncrazy fast like I think I maybe only\ntook like 30 seconds to a minute to fix\nit but they like kept going obviously so\nI just like chased and chased and chased\nand chased as hard as I could and I\ncould see them so I was like man I think\nI can make\nit so yeah then I like how did you fill\nit so fast uh CO2 just had like had it\nready I just added in a little pocket on\nmy uh hydration pack and then yeah a\nlittle plug and just it went really\nsmooth I I think that's the second time\nI've ever fixed a flat and the last time\nthe time before that took way longer so\nthis was CO2 with a plug this is it\nwasn't just like it filled up from like\na a tubless setup but you actually you\npluged the you you jammed in plugg the\ntire filled it up jumped back on the\nbike and chased them down yeah pretty\nmuch oh my my gosh yeah it's not as\ncrazy as it sounds but well it\nwent yeah like but I I fixed that I\nfixed enough tires to know that like yes\nit is rare for it to go that smooth for\nyou to be able to get off find the hole\nfigure out that it is a hole get it get\nthis get the thing out get the get it\nplugged have the plug stay have the have\nthe CO2 cartridge fill up enough that\nyou actually can roll at a decent clip\nlike a lot of things have to go right in\nthat repair to to even have it feel like\na repair let alone be able to chase\nfolks down so that is impressive yeah I\nwas pleased I guess you could say so\nyeah and then I guess to finish up the\nrace uh Conrad crushed us like he went\nway off the front but uh when we got to\nthe end we were all just kind of like\npacked up no one wanted to like do any\nwork off the front so it's like kind of\nsoft pedaling in and then and I don't\nknow like basically right before we\nturned onto the like where we came into\nthe Finish there everyone just lit it up\nas hard as they could and I got out\nfront pretty early and that gravel was\nway too loose to be like pushing as hard\nas I was so it was pretty sketchy but I\ndon't know I didn't crash and made it to\nthe end so there's some of our races\nwhere I think we set up well to have a\nSprint finish I would personally like\nthat was one of our biggest concerns we\nlove the venue for Fairfield at um\nFishback and Steven Cider House like\nit's a beautiful amazing venue but it is\na little tricky for a fast finish which\nexactly is what happened with the 100K\nremember your this pack coming in that\nwas it was very competitive people there\nthere were people really riding hard uh\ncoming in after con uh Conrad came in\nbecause he came in and he was definitely\nspent because he he pushed hard you\ncould tell that to to keep that\nseparation between you and that chase\ngroup um uh and but yeah there's a we we\nwe put you on a basically a pedestrian\nhiking path for a short section and then\nyou have to turn off of that and then\nit's on like this little tiny path sort\nof thing and then it goes on to gravel\nwhich is basically the driveway for the\nuh for The Cider House and then that\ndriveway is uphill like it's not like\nit's a little down and then it's uphill\non this curvy little driveway all the\nway up and I was I was frankly very\nafraid for everybody who anybody who's\nlike I think I'm going to do a Sprint\nfinish at the end um but thankfully I\ndon't think anybody wiped out there at\nthe end but it's not an easy sprint\nfinish because of that curve and the the\nuphill as you come in yeah yeah and like\nyou were talking about that like hiking\npath thing like right before the gravel\nat the end there I don't I don't think I\nwas on the hiking path at all was just\nstraight up in the grass like just\ntrying to get around\neveryone yeah and which you know that's\nthat is some of the fun of racing right\nis is taking the uh taking the line that\nyou think you can and and going for it\nand as fun as that is and I and I get\nthat like from a race director's point\nof view I'm always like oh my goodness\nhow do I keep these folks from like\ndestroying themselves or breaking a\nwrist or something like that so I uh\nappreciate your your guts and your HSPA\nat the same time I I it's the folks like\nyou that give me like don't let me sleep\nwell the night before if I don't feel\nlike I have every section of the the the\nending figured out so but still very fun\nvery cool um so so anything else you'd\nhave from Fairfield like what that uh\nthings that stood out to\nyou not really I really liked all there\nwas like tons of B- roads and that was\nreally fun so and lots of like little\nPunchy like up and down climbs like lots\nof rollers and yeah I thought it was\nreally fun that was the most like in a\nrace I've ever been so it was a lot of\nfun for me that's awesome I'm glad you\nhad a good time is there are there any\nother races like I kind of that's what\nkind of got us on the the injur injury\nconversation but are there other races\nthat you kind of have your eye on um\neither in Iowa or out\nuh I mean I did that core 4 race this\nyear that was the first gravel race I\ndid that was really fun so yeah I\ndefinitely want to do that again I kind\nof want to go back and do the 5 again\nand then just like obviously like some\nof your races there's like that Big\nRiver gravel series might try to hit\nsome of them who knows do so you like\nthe you know the going out to the 5 do\nyou like climbing is that is that a\nplace of strength for you or do you feel\nI mean because Fairfield is not a big\nlike you said it's more Punchy it's more\nterrain changing with the the B- roads\ncoming on and off and everything kind of\nlike core 4 not a lot of climbing and\neverything uh do you are you interested\nin more things with with\nclimbing I mean I'm not really built as\na climber I guess like I'm like 63 like\n180 something 100 somewhere in there\npounds so like I'm not exactly someone\nyou look at and you're like man he's a\ngood climber but I actually do enjoy\nclimbing quite a bit I kind of like the\ngrind of it so I don't know it's a wish\nwash I guess well I so I I grew up\nloving I'm not a fast climber either I'm\nunfortunately like 510 and closer to\n17080 pounds something like that so I\nmean my my fast climbing days are a\nlittle bit uh over but I still enjoy the\ngrind and so uh if I might suggest a few\nraces at least in our gra in the gravel\nseries and everything that have those\nclimbs I walk-on is in uh June that's\nthe driftless hills kind of north of\nnorth and east of Dora beautiful area\nbig long climbs lots of fun trout\nstreams along the way it's the the the\nviews are spectacular and then the other\none is Soldier cut off Hill Duro in uh\nthis year it's going to be in September\nuh and uh that's over here on the the\nwest side of Iowa and that one has four\ncategorized clins on it and that's it\nlike it doesn't have a lot of like\nrollers rollers it has four big climbs\nbasically which is kind of fun and I\nthink a little unusual for Iowa because\nif you've ever you know ridden around\nwell your area CA Rapids but also even\nthe de area it's more of it's more of\nlike you know just Ry terrain and and so\nit's both walk-on and and Soldier cut\noff are a little bit different so I\nalways I always love to plug those to\nfolks that are that haven't done them\nyet or or if they love to climb because\nthey're some of my\nfavorite yeah oh I'm definitely like\nstill in the checking out races stage of\nliving around here so yeah I'll\ndefinitely look into it for sure cool um\nso we talked a little bit about\nnutrition we talked a little bit about\ngear um there's one question that I\nalways love to ask as well which is and\nI think I mentioned it to you beforehand\nwhich is the magic wand question like if\nyou if you had something that you could\nchange in cycling that would just like\nsuddenly make the world different or\nbetter you know take away the pain in\nyour life I'm Cur do you have anything\nin mind I know for some folks this this\nquestion they're like I love cycling why\nwould I want anything to change but\ncurious if there's anything in your life\nthat you're like you're like man if I\ncould change this about cycling I\ntotally would\nuh I don't know I'm pretty new to this\nwhole thing so far so I don't have a\nwhole lot that I can gripe about I mean\nit'd be nice if like bikes were like $2\ninstead of like $8,000\nbut I don't know that's just kind of a\nnature of the game I guess yeah it's if\nwe could figure out a way for all of us\nto get sponsored by somebody that would\nbe kind of great yeah that would be\nsweet yeah yeah if anybody's out there\nlistening and wants to sponsor uh Gabe\nin his adventures and make sure he has\nthe right gear for all these great races\nuh please reach out we we'll we'll uh\nwe'll get you\nconnected that's the most I can do for\nyou is at least at least put out\na say Hey you know go go get you\nsponsored major gripes I guess yeah I\nwould change yet\nanyway totally understand well we've got\num we've got a bunch of races coming up\nin this next year uh we're going to keep\nthe seven that we have and we're super\nexcited for that um I uh so I hope that\nwe can get you out on a race here soon\nuh Gabe anything else before maybe drop\noff for this evening it's been fantastic\nuh getting to know you a little\nbit uh not really I mean thanks for\nhaving me it's kind of cool to like I\ndon't that you're doing this thing where\nyou just get all these people and figure\nout where they came from and how they\nended up doing this whole gravel biking\nthing and racing it's I don't know it's\nkind of fun to\nsee it is and then I and honestly I I\nreally do enjoy the opportunity to kind\nof like build and uh see something like\nthis happen um I uh gravel racing uh has\nbeen a way for me to just find uh My\nTribe a little bit find the folks that I\nlove to hang out with and and and new\npeople and get to know folks like you so\nthank you really appreciate being a part\nof it and uh bring your friends invite\nyour siblings invite anybody that you\nknow to come come and hang out with us\nand if anybody needs help getting into\nit like you know let us know so that we\ncan just make this thing better because\nuh gravel is definitely one of those\nthings in cycling where it's the the\nmore the more folks there the better it\nis yeah for sure cool well yeah so good\ntalking to you uh have a fantastic\nweekend happy holidays and we will uh\ntalk to you soon thanks",

This Iowa gravel race is part of the regional gravel racing scene that draws riders from across the Midwest. The race represents the type of gravel event that has become popular in Iowa, where gravel cycling has emerged as the primary cycling discipline due to the terrain being better suited for gravel bikes than mountain bikes. Riders come from various backgrounds, including former runners and mountain bikers who have transitioned to gravel racing. The race appears to be well-established within the Iowa gravel racing circuit and attracts riders looking for competitive gravel racing opportunities in the region."
