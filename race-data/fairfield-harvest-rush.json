        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "October 4th in Iowa is prime riding weather - cool mornings, crisp afternoons, minimal heat stress. They prep rain routes because weather gets unpredictable, but that's smart planning. Fall in the Midwest beats summer anywhere for gravel grinding."

      "experience": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "The emphasis on being a race \"you can invite your family or buddy that's new to gravel grinding\" speaks to welcoming atmosphere over memorable challenge. Solid organization and community support create pleasant day out rather than epic tale."

        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Over 150 racers sounds decent until you realize that's across three different courses. No mention of notable riders, pro categories, or competitive depth. When the race description focuses on being 'friendly to new racers,' the sharks aren't circling these waters."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "$40 grassroots entry with chip timing, aid stations, SAG support, and pro photography is honest pricing. The $399 Iowa Gravel Series pass covering all seven races sweetens the deal if you're doing the circuit."
