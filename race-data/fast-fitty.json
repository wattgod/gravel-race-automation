SUBSCRIBE for free WATTS 👉 https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsr-SU_SAqjrzmu4kXIRfUQ?sub_confirmation=1\n\nFast Fitty gravel race was held in Charlotte, MI, and featured some pleasant views and rolling climbs. The course traversed Eaton and Barry counties along Lacey Lake with approximately 85% smooth, but muddy, gravel roads. There were 3 different distances, and I raced the 54 mile as part of the Michigan Gravel Race Series (MGRS) Long category.\n\nThe area received some rain the day before and the forecast called for scattered thunderstorms on race day. I was expecting the course to be muddy and was hoping we'd miss the rain, unfortunately we did not. The race stared off with a few attacks and there was a crash at 24:40 that I just barely missed. I believe he either overlapped wheels or thought we were turning left. \n\nAfter the crash I felt a bit uneasy about the rest of the race. The rain started around 30 minutes in and it was setting up for a break to get away. There were several solo attacks to attempt to start a breakaway and eventually at around 43:00 the last of 3 individuals was successful. I wasn't positioned to take advantage of the beak and didn't have the legs to attempt a bridge across. For the next hour the group mostly stayed together until another group of 3 got away at 1:42:40. I knew I needed to be in this breakaway, but my legs were done and I couldn't cover the move.\n\nThe remaining group was about 11-15 racers and for the last hour no one was interested in catching the breakaway or pulling in the front. There were a few of us willing to work and I tried to create a break but was unsuccessful, so I just waited for the sprint. Luckily, I was able to win the group sprint to take 7th overall and 2nd in my age group. A bit disappointed I couldn't cover the second break but this being my 3rd race in 4 weeks meant I was in desperate need of a recovery week. \n\n👉 Hey!
