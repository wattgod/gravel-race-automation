Around mile 20 I was riding alone.\" Gimpdiggity bonked at mile 35 in 2020, calling it quits. The distance rewards steady pacing over explosive efforts, with \"long, grinding climbs that seem to never end\" wearing down undertrained riders systematically."

        "explanation": "\"Right off the pavement it was pure washboard. I couldn't avoid it. It was high speed, and it sucked,\" describes the early gravel transition that scattered a 10-rider group. Two pothole incidents around mile 30 happened \"in transitions into the shadows\" on descents. The 80% gravel surface is mostly smooth rolling roads, but weather turns it into a \"mudder\" requiring bike handling adjustments rather than true technical skills."

Grades hit 7% before flattening to \"3-4% for a while,\" with rollers building from \"2-3%\" early to \"5 or 6%\" by mile 15. A climb around mile 41 reaches 6%, and there's \"a kicker\" at mile 52. The consistent elevation \"keeps creeping\" without major suffering."

        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Being \"the 6th person to sign up\" earns you a low number plate that draws confused stares at the start line, but no competitive credibility. Regional Michigan Gravel Race Series event in Charlotte lacks notable winners or pro field data. The charitable focus on human trafficking victim rehabilitation adds meaning but doesn't elevate competitive status beyond weekend warrior racing."

        "explanation": "Cash payouts to top 3 men and women show organization, but execution varies with conditions.

Course marshaling by Eaton County Sheriff's Department at major crossings provides safety infrastructure, though volunteer-marshaled crossings create consistency questions."

Mid-race cooperation opportunities arise: \"I had a guy catch me. He moved ahead of me and waved me to follow. We worked together for the next few miles.\" However, isolation sets in quickly - around mile 20 riders often find themselves alone, making it a test of individual pacing rather than group dynamics."
