        "explanation": "Downtown Lanesboro start at 10 a.m. provides straightforward logistics despite the varying route between Lanesboro and Stewartville courses. Nicholas Garbis describes how 533 riders started in 2018 despite snow/freezing rain when \"the PA system would not work in the weather.\" The race traditionally begins with pre-race breakfast at Tarsilla's in Stewartville for \"good greasy spoon country breakfast cuisine.\""
      },
      "length": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Nicholas Garbis captures the challenge with his \"meteor strategy\" of \"hurtling myself into inhospitable atmosphere of the faster riders and hoping I don't completely disintegrate.\" NewMe1977 completed the 3,300-foot climb over \"7:12 grueling hours\" while others finish in half that time. The 50-mile distance serves as a \"gateway drug for gravel cycling\" but satisfies neither quick efforts nor epic adventures. More compact than Grinduro."
      },
      "technicality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Julie Dunkle found the course challenging with \"rocks, ruts, and bumps everywhere\" including technical features like \"Raptor Ridge, a singletrack descent.\" Nicholas Garbis experienced limestone spray \"streaming from people's rear wheels, forward against their vertical seat tubes, dripping downward like a car wash.\" The gravel roads test fitness over handling skills with successful completions on everything from fat bikes to fixies. Less technical than The Mid South."
      },
      "elevation": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "The 3,300 feet of elevation gain over 50 miles delivers rolling punishment through Minnesota's bluff country. Erik Hyland felt the intensity: \"The second half brought new hills, each one steeper than the last. My muscles were on the verge of cramping, screaming at me to stop.\" The climbs provide rhythm changes without sustained mountainous ascents that define elevation-focused events. Less climbing than The Mid South."
      },
      "climate": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Historical weather data shows average highs of 54°F and lows of 41°F, with a 41% chance of rain on any given day. Nicholas Garbis calls it \"one of the greatest mysteries in the Minnesota gravel cycling scene\" how the race went years with \"images of sun and mild temps. I don't think I've worn a jacket. Ever.\" But 2018 delivered \"temperatures just above freezing with rain/snow mix\" when the race finally lived up to its \"Filthy\" name. October timing usually favors riders but Minnesota weather can surprise. Similar climate challenges to SBT GRVL."
      },
      "altitude": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Southeast Minnesota's bluff country sits in river valleys well under 1,500 feet above sea level with zero altitude considerations. The \"bluffs\" are relative elevations from river bottoms, not mountainous terrain requiring altitude training or oxygen supply concerns. Lower altitude than Gravel Worlds — no thin-air concerns."
      },
      "adventure": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "The route winds through golden valleys and wooded ridges with landmarks like mid-course churches and bridges marking the journey. Trenton's dad Joel provides position callouts at crossroads while riders navigate limestone-crusted terrain. NewMe1977 found \"everyone was so nice and welcoming\" during the rural exploration, though you're never far from civilization in Fillmore County agricultural country."
      },
      "prestige": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Twelve years running since 2013 makes this a Midwest gravel classic, but it's not pulling national talent or media coverage. The race draws hundreds to downtown Lanesboro each October, creating local buzz with street celebrations and Sylvan Brewing post-ride parties. Regional riders know the name, but you won't find sponsored teams flying in from Colorado to chase podiums here."
      },
      "race_quality": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "The course delivers proper gravel challenge through varied terrain with meaningful elevation and technical features like Raptor Ridge. Banjo Brothers provides mid-course support with \"whiskey and coke and cookies\" while Joel calls out positions at crossroads. Creative awards include \"fifty-cent coins drilled through and laced as a necklace\" for first and last 50 finishers."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "The complete package spans pre-race breakfast at Tarsilla's to post-ride celebrations with Sylvan Brewing and food trucks in downtown Lanesboro. October timing delivers peak fall colors through the bluff country terrain. NewMe1977 captured the atmosphere: \"It was hard but I am so glad I did it,\" reflecting the welcoming yet challenging nature that defines the race weekend experience."
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "This is where the Filthy 50 earns its reputation—the post-ride scene with Sylvan Brewing, food trucks, games, and small-town hospitality creates the kind of atmosphere gravel riders actually remember. Hundreds of riders converge on downtown Lanesboro for what locals describe as high-energy weekend excitement for both participants and spectators. The 12-year history has built real relationships and traditions that extend beyond just showing up to race."
      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "The multiple distance options spread competitive focus across 25/50/100-mile races, with one blogger noting \"the finish was wild this year, with the top 10 riders crossing within seconds of each other.\" The field ranges from NewMe1977's 7-hour fat bike effort to sub-4-hour competitive finishes. The \"gateway drug\" reputation brings new riders alongside experienced gravel racers. Similar competitive depth to Rule of Three."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "No registration fees listed in the research, but the complete package—race, post-ride celebration, food trucks, games, and small-town festival atmosphere—typically delivers solid value for Midwest gravel events. The October timing avoids peak travel season costs, and Lanesboro's small-town lodging options won't break budgets like destination race markets. Multiple distance options let riders choose their financial and physical commitment level."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Registration runs $75-$100. Southeast Minnesota location requires dedicated travel from major airports, with small-town Lanesboro lodging options creating potential bottlenecks during race weekend. The pre-race tradition at Tarsilla's in Stewartville and post-ride celebrations add dining costs but enhance the experience. October timing helps avoid peak summer rates, though you're still looking at a regional trip unless living within driving distance. Similar expense level to Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

      "should_you_race": "If you're looking for a chill fall colors tour with 3000 feet of rolling climbs, this works. The Lanesboro setting is pretty, the vibe is friendly, and 50 miles won't destroy your weekend. Skip it if you want real competition or technical challenge—this is more community ride than gravel race. Any decent gravel bike handles these roads fine.",
