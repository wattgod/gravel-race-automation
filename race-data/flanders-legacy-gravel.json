        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "147km hits the endurance sweet spot without overreach—Aaron Van der Beken's winning time of 4:02:12 shows serious but not death-march pacing. The 96km option for older categories keeps it challenging without the full suffer-fest."

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "950m of climbing across 147km averages just 6.5m per kilometer with 'inclines never very steep.' The distributed elevation profile creates sustained grinding rather than punchy Alpine suffering in famously flat Belgium."

      "altitude": {
        "score": 1,

        "score": 3,

      "prestige": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "It's a UCI qualifier riding on the coattails of Leuven's 2024 Gravel Worlds, but this is edition one. No history, no legendary moments, just marketing copy about 'true legacy for gravel enthusiasts.' The 2000-rider cap and Bolero series finale positioning might build something, but prestige isn't inherited—it's earned through decades of suffering."
      },
      "race_quality": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "The elite men's finish delivered a competitive 12-rider sprint with Van der Beken taking victory, while women's elite saw just 23 seconds separate the podium. Professional race execution on proven Worlds-caliber terrain validates the concept."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "The promise to 'relive the atmosphere, challenge, and scenery that the pros faced during the 2024 Gravel World Championships' delivered with authentic Flemish gravel character. Multi-lap format through Heverlee to Leuven provides tactical progression."
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "1,200 registered riders for the inaugural edition shows strong regional draw, while the elite field attracted established names like Floris Van Tricht and Tessa Neefjes. Belgium's deep cycling culture provides community foundation beyond first-year numbers."
      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Notable starters included 2024 Worlds fourth-place Floris Van Tricht, plus Van Avermaet and Bakelants showing serious elite engagement. But as inaugural edition with regional focus, depth remains limited compared to established international events."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "€57-67 entry fees provide reasonable European pricing for UCI qualifier status and Worlds-proven course access. The 147km distance and established terrain quality justify the cost without reaching the €100+ territory of premium European events."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Belgium's higher cost structure affects lodging and dining, while international travel to Brussels Airport adds expense. The Leuven university town location provides options, but European cycling travel consistently hits budgets harder than domestic racing."
