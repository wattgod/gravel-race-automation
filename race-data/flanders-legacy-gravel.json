        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "147km hits the endurance sweet spot without overreach—Aaron Van der Beken's winning time of 4:02:12 shows serious but not death-march pacing. The 96km option for older categories keeps it challenging without the full suffer-fest. Similar distance to Crusher in the Tushar."

      "technicality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Course description emphasizes 'rolling short steep hills or moderate, sustained climbs' rather than technical bike handling challenges. The 48km loop format uses established roads from Worlds courses, prioritizing power over precision. Less technical than The Mid South."

      "elevation": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "950m of climbing across 147km averages just 6.5m per kilometer with 'inclines never very steep.' The distributed elevation profile creates sustained grinding rather than punchy Alpine suffering in famously flat Belgium. Less climbing than The Mid South."

        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Historical weather data shows average highs of 61°F and lows of 49°F, with a 61% chance of rain on any given day, and gusts reaching 28 mph. Mid-October in Leuven delivers classic cycling shoulder season conditions—cool enough for hard efforts, mild enough to avoid gear complications. Belgium's peak cycling season timing avoids both summer heat and winter weather chaos. Similar climate challenges to SBT GRVL."

      "altitude": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Starting around 30 meters above sea level in Leuven means zero altitude considerations or acclimatization needs. This is pure sea-level racing in the Flemish lowlands. Lower altitude than Gravel Worlds — no thin-air concerns."

      "adventure": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Racing 'the most beautiful gravel sectors in and around Leuven' through the same terrain that hosted both Road and Gravel World Championships delivers cycling heartland authenticity. The 60% Worlds course overlap provides proven adventure pedigree."

      "prestige": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "It's a UCI qualifier riding on the coattails of Leuven's 2024 Gravel Worlds, but this is edition one. No history, no legendary moments, just marketing copy about 'true legacy for gravel enthusiasts.' The 2000-rider cap and Bolero series finale positioning might build something, but prestige isn't inherited—it's earned through decades of suffering."
      },
      "race_quality": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "The elite men's finish delivered a competitive 12-rider sprint with Van der Beken taking victory, while women's elite saw just 23 seconds separate the podium. Professional race execution on proven Worlds-caliber terrain validates the concept."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "The promise to 'relive the atmosphere, challenge, and scenery that the pros faced during the 2024 Gravel World Championships' delivered with authentic Flemish gravel character. Multi-lap format through Heverlee to Leuven provides tactical progression."
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "1,200 registered riders for the inaugural edition shows strong regional draw, while the elite field attracted established names like Floris Van Tricht and Tessa Neefjes. Belgium's deep cycling culture provides community foundation beyond first-year numbers."
      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Notable starters included 2024 Worlds fourth-place Floris Van Tricht, plus Van Avermaet and Bakelants showing serious elite engagement. But as inaugural edition with regional focus, depth remains limited compared to established international events. Less competitive depth than Almanzo 100."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "€57-67 entry fees provide reasonable European pricing for UCI qualifier status and Worlds-proven course access. The 147km distance and established terrain quality justify the cost without reaching the €100+ territory of premium European events."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Registration runs €50-80. Belgium's higher cost structure affects lodging and dining, while international travel to Brussels Airport adds expense. The Leuven university town location provides options, but European cycling travel consistently hits budgets harder than domestic racing. Higher total cost than Badlands."

          "description": "The last outdoor race of the season \n\nAs mentioned after my Worlds movie I got sick the day after.\nInstead of working towards this last race it was working to get healthy again.\nIt was a late call, even had my doubts the morning itself if it was a good idea to go.\nBut I’m not made of glass, so I took all my courage and got into the car.\n\nI started well, much better than expected, I managed to stay top-5 for a long time, even top-3 for a while until, due to slower riders, I lost the wheel of my compatriot. I came riding solo in 8th position but I often used slower riders to hide from the wind in the open spaces not needlessly spending all my energy.\n\nIn the last lap we were only 4 fighting for places 8 to 11, until I got dropped on the last hill of the day. I went in TT mode after but wasn’t able to catch on again.\n\nEnded this year with an unexpected 11th place and qualification for Worlds Gravel 2026.",
