Similar distance to Crusher in the Tushar. As Motocraftsman puts it: \"Fun Fact, The Death Ride began in Matfield Green, KS. John Hobbs would scare the s**t out of you before you even started. I don't remember much about encouraging words, or finish line hugs.\""

Less technical than The Mid South."

The rolling Flint Hills prairie creates consistent climbing through old ghost towns, oil fields, and cow pastures rather than massive peak ascents. Similar elevation profile to Gravel Worlds."

        "explanation": "Historical weather data shows average highs of 69°F and lows of 46°F, with a 39% chance of rain on any given day, and gusts reaching 29 mph. The 2003 race continued despite 'tremendous rains' that flooded Interstate 35 and killed seven people, forcing riders through 'forty-foot river crossings where the water had completely submerged the bridge.' Typical years brought 'dehydration, sunburns' in Kansas heat with no prairie shelter from wind or sun. More weather exposure than Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

        "score": 3,

      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Despite organizational failures, the Flint Hills terrain delivered memorable suffering. In 2003's extreme weather, only 31 riders finished the flooded course 'better suited for boats and ducks than mountain bikes,' with final finishers completing just before 7 PM after over 10 hours of racing."

The 2003 extreme weather year saw significant attrition with 'only 31 riders made it to the finish line' after the flooded river crossing and deteriorating conditions eliminated many participants. Less competitive depth than Almanzo 100."

      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Redneck Biker paid $80 but never received his jersey despite months of contact attempts with organizer Paul Corcoran. Rural Kansas around Madison and Matfield Green offers reasonable lodging and food costs, with the current UNDEAD event charging just $20 entry fees. Similar expense level to Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."
