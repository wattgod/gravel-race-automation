Mid-September in Georgia's mountains brings unpredictable conditions. Rain route protocols exist due to wet weather concerns—used twice since 2014 including 2022 and 2024. No specific weather data available for Dahlonega timing, but the required alternate course suggests regular weather disruptions. More weather exposure than Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

Zero altitude excuse territory for anyone coming from below 500 feet. Lower altitude than Gravel Worlds — no thin-air concerns."

Wine country setting at Montaluce adds post-race exploration beyond typical gravel road grinding."

Capped field size keeps it local-focused."

      "race_quality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Rain route requirement shows planning for trail conditions, with alternate Southern Cross Course when Bull and Jake trails are saturated. USDA Forest Service permit protocols and multiuse trail management suggest professional operations. However, rigid registration cutoffs and limited communication windows reduce flexibility. As Michael Leach puts it: \"After I lost contact with Max, my NH comrade and I gave it all we had. In total, we climbed for 2 hours and 20 minutes over the course of 27 miles and covering nearly 3800 feet of elevation.\""

      "community": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Regional southeastern event with dedicated Facebook following and tiered pricing that rewards early commitment.

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "300-rider cap with pricing tiers suggests decent local turnout but zero national pull. No pro field data available because there isn't one worth mentioning. You're racing weekend warriors and regional MTB crossover athletes, not gravel's heavy hitters. Less competitive depth than Almanzo 100."

        "explanation": "Tiered pricing from $110-130 for 54 miles includes boxed lunch, beer, and primitive camping at Montaluce Winery. Early commitment pricing rewards planning ahead. Course delivers singletrack descents and wine country infrastructure that most regional races can't match for the entry fee."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Registration runs $60-100. Dahlonega sits 80 miles from Atlanta airport, so factor in rental car costs and mountain lodging premiums. September timing avoids peak leaf season pricing but still commands Georgia mountain rates. Wine country location means you'll pay tourist prices for everything. Similar expense level to Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."
