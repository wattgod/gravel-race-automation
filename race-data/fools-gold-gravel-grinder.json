        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Basic XC Marathon setup with standard trail markings and marshals, but zero race-day registration flexibility and communication limited to Friday evening emails. The permit is still pending with USDA Forest Service, which screams amateur hour logistics. Mountain Goat Adventures keeps it functional but forgettable."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Fast flowy singletrack through Bull And Jake Mountain trails with legitimate descents and two major sustained climbs. Starting at Montaluce Winery adds wine country ambiance that softens the suffering. The mix of pavement and dirt keeps you honest without being revolutionary."
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Regional southeastern event with dedicated Facebook following and tiered pricing that rewards early commitment. Mountain Goat Adventures has built a loyal local crew, but it stays firmly in the Georgia mountains bubble. Solid for making friends, weak for building your cycling resume."
      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "300-rider cap with pricing tiers suggests decent local turnout but zero national pull. No pro field data available because there isn't one worth mentioning. You're racing weekend warriors and regional MTB crossover athletes, not gravel's heavy hitters."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "$110-130 for 54 miles of mixed terrain and wine country vibes hits the regional race sweet spot. Early bird pricing rewards planning, and you get legitimate singletrack descents for your money. Not cheap, not gouging—just standard southeastern pricing."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Dahlonega sits 80 miles from Atlanta airport, so factor in rental car costs and mountain lodging premiums. September timing avoids peak leaf season pricing but still commands Georgia mountain rates. Wine country location means you'll pay tourist prices for everything."
      },
      "length": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "54-mile option lands in that comfortable all-day adventure zone without committing to true suffer-fest distance. Two major climbs spread across the course give you recovery time between efforts. Long enough to matter, short enough to finish strong and hit the winery."
      },
      "technicality": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Fast flowy singletrack with legitimate descents demands actual bike handling skills beyond gravel grinding. XC Marathon classification means technical enough to drop pure roadies but accessible to competent riders. Two sustained climbs test fitness more than bike skills."
      },
      "elevation": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Two major sustained climbs in 54 miles means serious vertical gain in Georgia's North Mountains. Bull And Jake trails don't mess around with gradient, and those singletrack descents earn every foot you climb. Real mountain suffering disguised as wine country touring."
      },
      "climate": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Mid-September in Dahlonega brings unpredictable weather ranging from summer heat to early fall storms. Georgia humidity can still crush you in September, and mountain weather changes fast. No historical weather data available, which means you're gambling on conditions."
      },
      "altitude": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Starting around 1400 feet in Dahlonega barely counts as elevation, even for southeastern standards. Whatever the high point hits on Bull And Jake trails won't stress your red blood cell count. Sea level athletes get zero excuse for altitude struggles here."
      },
      "logistics": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Montaluce Winery provides civilized start/finish infrastructure, but no race-day registration kills flexibility for travelers. Registration closes September 8th with rigid procedures and Friday-only communication windows. Functional but inflexible—plan ahead or stay home."
      },
      "adventure": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Legitimate singletrack descents and sustained mountain climbs through Georgia's wine country deliver real adventure between the gravel mainstream. Bull And Jake trails offer proper wilderness exposure beyond typical gravel road grinding. Wine country setting adds post-race adventure potential most races can't match."
