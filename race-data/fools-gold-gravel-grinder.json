Mid-September in Georgia's mountains brings unpredictable conditions. Rain route protocols exist due to wet weather concerns—used twice since 2014 including 2022 and 2024. No specific weather data available for Dahlonega timing, but the required alternate course suggests regular weather disruptions. More weather exposure than Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

Zero altitude excuse territory for anyone coming from below 500 feet. Lower altitude than Gravel Worlds — no thin-air concerns."

Wine country setting at Montaluce adds post-race exploration beyond typical gravel road grinding."

Capped field size keeps it local-focused."

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Rain route requirement shows planning for trail conditions, with alternate Southern Cross Course when Bull and Jake trails are saturated. USDA Forest Service permit protocols and multiuse trail management suggest professional operations. However, rigid registration cutoffs and limited communication windows reduce flexibility. As Michael Leach puts it: \"After I lost contact with Max, my NH comrade and I gave it all we had. In total, we climbed for 2 hours and 20 minutes over the course of 27 miles and covering nearly 3800 feet of elevation.\""

      "community": {
        "score": 3,

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "300-rider cap with pricing tiers suggests decent local turnout but zero national pull. No pro field data available because there isn't one worth mentioning.

        "explanation": "Tiered pricing from $110-130 for 54 miles includes boxed lunch, beer, and primitive camping at Montaluce Winery. Early commitment pricing rewards planning ahead. Course delivers singletrack descents and wine country infrastructure that most regional races can't match for the entry fee."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Registration runs $60-100. Dahlonega sits 80 miles from Atlanta airport, so factor in rental car costs and mountain lodging premiums. September timing avoids peak leaf season pricing but still commands Georgia mountain rates. Wine country location means you'll pay tourist prices for everything. Similar expense level to Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

a gravel race even\nthough it's supposed to be a mountain\nbike\nrace\nJacksonville Florida state championship\nseries round two then we're going to\nclose with some a little a little bit of\nmountain bike training like I mentioned\na little bit\nearlier as well as the famous\nwooda racing just things that I hear at\nevery one of the events and then what's\nin your water bottle because of the\nsubscribers like you today's episode is\nbrought to you by you cycling that's Yu\nyou\ncycling they're the clothes cycling\nclothes that I've been using for a\ncouple of years now

U\ncycling so check it out if you got a\nmoment it's\nyuu\ncycling.com that's U\ncycling.com really cool company based\nout of Miami so all right so where were\nwe a couple weeks\nago Fool's Gold so the last episode I\nwas talking a little bit about racing in\nTallahassee where I said uh Blood Sweat\nand no gears because the conditions were\nabsolutely horrendous so uh one week\nlater what am I going to do decided I'm\ngoing to go up to Dela Georgia for\nmountain goat Adventures for fool's gold\n2024 edition of Fool's Gold done Fool's\nGold for the past for the past couple\nyears uh usually falls on a Saturday and\nunfortunately it sometimes falls in the\nsame weekend as our Florida state\nchampionship series kickoff that happens\nin Tallahassee was very fortunate this\nyear that it was actually an off weekend\nso we went Tallahassee fo's gold and\nthen up to uh Jacksonville again I said\nin the last one up to because I'm based\nout of South Florida so I reference a\nlot of things having to go up the state\nevery place that we go racing winds up\nbeing up up the state to Jacksonville so\nlet's talk a little bit about Fool's\nGold so I said it was a uh a gravel race\nit's not supposed to be a gravel race so\nthe race normally is off-road it's about\n50 there's two classes there's a 38 mile\nand then there's a 54 a 54 mile class I\nelect every year to try and do the to do\nthe 54 mile race lot of climbing you\nstart at montal loose Winery head out\nfrom the winery you got to ride some\nasphalt for quite a while uh a good fun\ndownhill groups really tight at that\npoint then uh we make a turn left hand\nturn over a bridge and then you start\ninto the country into the Country Roads\nriding up the mountain down the mountain\nand then into some really fast fun fun\nsingle track that's the way the route\nnormally\ngoes backstory to this in 20122 we had\nthe same opportunity to go there uh I\nshow up into Delanica on a thir th day\nwith my race bike getting ready for a\nmountain bike race and come to find out\nthat we learned about something called\nthe rain route the rain route simply\nmeans the Department of Forestry will\nactually shut down the event and not\nallow people to ride\noff-road uh due to due to the weather\ndue to due to the\nconditions so unfortunately two years\nago 2022 I actually showed up with my\nmountain bike Mountain Bike setup ready\nto go and come to find out that same\nnight we then get a report that they\nhave to run the rain route wasn't even\naware of this rain route what is the\nrain route all gravel winds up being a\n50-m loop of all gravel roads zero\nzero. single track none climbing and\ndescending so this\nyear they did a much better job much\nmuch better job of letting us know about\nthe rain route what actually happened is\nthere was a the there was a\nhurricane uh I think a hurricane that\ncame across a l came across Louisiana\nand the angle of the hurricane was\nsupposed to dump a lot of the remnants\nand the rains up in up in dela um Dela\nis just a little bit north I think maybe\nNorth slightly Northeast of Atlanta so\npretty far up in uh up into Atlanta I\nmean up into Georgia so we didn't so so\nI'm at home on on Wednesday they\nactually put something out and said on\nWednesday night they're going to make\nthe decision are we going to have to use\nthe rain route or in fact are we going\nto have to use the uh are we going to be\nable to do the regular mountain bike\ncourse so Wednesday night got the report\ngoing to have to use the rain route the\ndepartment of farry said nope can't ride\nthe single track too much expected rain\nthey called it biblical biblical rains\nthat were coming\nnot allowed to not allowed to do it oh\nas a matter of fact I think the reason\none of the reasons why was this was\n2022 I think in\n1 or\n2020 it was by far the worst conditions\ndownpour conditions race that I have\never done I I I would I'm going to rank\nit somewhere in the top three could be\nnumber one but definitely the top three\nconditions of the worst the worst mud\nrace that I've ever I have ever done\nWater 2 3 4 in deep just running down\nthe hill it was it was horrendous fun as\nbut we we did a good job of\ndestroying the mountain so I can\nunderstand where they where they were\ncoming from after this event\nso I had experienced uh this I had this\nexperience in 2022 that I was there on a\nmountain bike uh mountain bike gearing\nfat tires flat bars everything what\nhappens on race day in 2022 because they\nput out the report Thursday night and I\nwas already in town for the race\nSaturday morning show up gravel bikes\nskinny tires big\ngears gravel race I'm there on a\nmountain bike fat tires but hey I got to\ndo I have to do what I have to do so\nstill pulled off a pretty good year so\nfast forward now we did it in 2023\nconditions were perfect mountain bike\nrace had an amazing time now we're there\nin 20 in 2024 get the report on\nWednesday that they that they have to\nrun the rain route which is all gravel\nso what did I decide to\ndo put up the picture right here if you\nlook at the picture I decided to build\nmy mountain bike because they also put\non the website that you're no longer\nallowed to have drop bars uh drop bars\nand gravel bikes as part of the rain\nroute why I think probably what what\nthey experienced in 2022 2 made the\nright decision that we can't go back to\nthe how unfair it was in 2022 they also\nspecified that there was no regulations\nas far as tire size so what did I decide\nto do again on that bike my mountain\nbike I built up my mountain bike with a\nset of gravel tires on it now I used in\npractice day I used a set of my pelli uh\nmy plli gravel tires 45s mounted on my\nmountain bike rims same drop bar same\ngear ratio I'm running a 36 absolute\nblack 36 over on the front and a 1052\ntransmission Shram Transmission in the\nrear so plenty of Gears that uh all the\ngears that I needed but definitely had\nsome rollability behind those\ntires so get into town with the with the\nbike that I built up ready to go Friday\nis practice day wound up being a little\nbit little bit on the Rainy side on\npractice day but I decided to the short\nLoop so there was two Loops there was a\n38 mile and a 50 mile I'm going to get\nback to that topic also because on race\nday come to find out that there was no\n38 it was actually everybody was doing\nthe rain route which was a 50 m\nLoop practice\nday uh I gambled with the\ntires and sure enough the\nfirst or maybe like the second or third\ndownhill that I had to go down flatted\nthose 48 uh 45 five tires going down the\nmountain with the gravel road kind of a\nrough actually a rough gravel road going\ndown the mountain with the gravel road\nthe tires uh I wound up blowing a tire\nput a hole in it got a little bit\nnervous about\nit uh plugged the tire got back to got\nback to the\nwinery left I decided to go buy one of\nthe local local bike shops in uh in\nDawson great great guys that uh that\ntook care of me there so when I was\nthere I was uh trying to get a new plug\nkit because I wind up using all my plugs\nbut as I was there I was thinking about\nthe tire the profile of the tire I\nstarted to get nervous about\nit and I was thinking about\nswitching I didn't\nswitch and it actually pan panned out to\nbe okay I didn't switch I went I\nswitched Brands I went to another set of\nof tires same thing 45 gravel tires had\na little bit of more sidewall knobs to\nit cuz I was a bit tentative in laying\nthe bike over uh down some of the\ncountry road\nmy lean angle wasn't as much as I'd like\nit I would have liked it to be I did\nalso run my\ndropper you'll hear in a lot of these\nvideos I talk about uh the necessity of\na dropper and just how much I use it and\njust how much I love it so even on the\neven on these Country govel Roads I'm\ndropping that TST as much as I possibly\ncan gives me a lower center of gravity\nmakes me feel a little bit more\ncomfortable and cornering I will say\nthis and I'll say this still on blue in\nthe face I have no idea if I'm any\nfaster because of how much I use my\ndropper seat post but I will tell you\nthis I damn sure am a lot more\ncomfortable and if you make me\ncomfortable something is probably going\nto happen I don't know what but\nsomething is going to happen so I will\nnever ride a bicycle without without a\ndropper\nagain yeah it's a pound heavier I get it\nI understand doesn't make a bit of\ndifference to me I love it and I'm going\nto continue to use\nit there's a story behind that too so\nlaid up a different set of tires decided\nI was going to take the chance and\nhopefully not flat on the downhills be a\nlittle bit more conscious of my line\nselection try to avoid some of the Rocks\ntry to get a little bit lighter a little\nbit more playful hop over some stuff and\nsee if I could really make those Tires\nTires work so show up on uh Saturday\nmorning is a race it's a 50 m 50 m race\nlike I said earlier come to find out it\nwas actually 50 MI for both classes they\nare uh both durations in off-road it's a\n38 mile and a 54 Mile in this case\nbecause of\nit excuse me because of it being a rain\nroute it's 50 mil for everybody so we\ntake off out of the winery I'm on uh I'm\non my Scott and by the way I didn't\nbring my race bike I actually brought my\npractice bike that's why you see in the\nin the picture that it's a yellow bike\nas opposed to in the other side over\nthere my black bike that I usually race\ncross country with I absolutely trashed\nthe bike in Tallahassee spent a couple\ndays rebuilding it bottom bracket brake\npads rebuilding the headset rebuilding\nthe the pedals cleaning out the free Hub\nbody just a lot of work and I wasn't in\nthe mood to do all that again to to beat\nthe hell out of the bike so I decided to\nuse my my practice uh my practice bike\npractice bike is honestly is just as\ngood it's just as good as my race bike\nthe only reason I refer to it as my\npractice bike is because I spend so much\ntime so much effort uh or so many miles\non the practice bike that the equipment\ngenerally takes a pretty good beating\nand my race bike only gets used on\nSaturdays for practice and Sundays for\nracing I race approximately 35 to 38\ntimes a year so that's all the bike gets\nused for so I know everything on it is\ngoing to be really good all right so\nthey say go we take\noff uh head down the head out of the\nmonolo winery down the main down the\nmain road no problem in a comfortable I\ndon't know top 10 top top 15 knowing\nthat once we get onto the fire roads and\nwe start to climb I'm actually pretty\nI'm actually pretty good with climbing\nso I had no no concern about my current\nposition once we really got into\nclimbing made my way uh made my way into\nit Pockets pocket uh groups started to\nseparate so I kind of got caught in\nbetween the lead Group which I think was\nfour people at the moment I was left\nsolo by myself and then there was people\nchasing chasing behind so climb with\neverybody had a great uh had a great day\ncaught one of the person one person that\nfell off the back of the group of three\nso I wound up in fourth position going\ndown the first Hill oh my God going down\nthe first Hill excited thinking I got\nthe the these uh my new gravel my new 45\ngravel tires with the with a little bit\nmore sidewall on it feeling confident\nabout going to Hill going down the hill\nthat's the dropper thumb this is the\nshifter thumb click the dropper dead\ndoesn't\nwork oh God I really want this dropper\ndead what happened with this is there's\na 2032 battery up in the shifter uh in\nthe shifter pod that because it was my\nrace bike I hadn't really paid attention\nto it I changed the batteries on my\ndropper post I changed my batteries on\nmy derailer every single time I ride I\nknew those were going to be okay but I\nneglected to check the battery up in the\nup in the Pod uh that sends a signal\nover to the seat post and come to find\nout battery was dead so guess what I\nmade do a little bit less uncomfortable\nbut I don't think the I don't think that\nthe outcome would not have been any\ndifferent the fact that my dropper post\nworked or it didn't or it didn't\nwork really un uneventful the rest of\nthe day not uh not a whole lot happened\na little bit nervous on the downhills\njust because of the fog the rain the the\nthe loose terrain but I learned a thing\nor two yes I'm still learning things 500\nI don't know what I have now 575 races\nnearing 600 races in my career and I'm\nstill trying to figure this out and I'm\nstill learning things that's one of the\nmain reasons why I'm so excited I guess\nto go out and and practice and train and\ndo the things that I do because I never\nI am never complacent and always willing\nto to learn\nso uh\nrace uh the race wind up taking me a\nlittle over a little over 3 hours which\nwasn't too bad for a 50 mile 50 mile\nrace roughly 6,000 6,000 ft of\nclimbing uh fun definitely a fun race I\nmuch much much would have uh preferred\noff-road but hey those were the cards\nthat we were that we were dealt\nso uh let's see let's see how uh let's\nsee how everybody did so we're just\ngoing to talk about the the main 50 mile\nclass we have Elliot bearing uh bearing\nperformance he actually won the won the\noverall did it in 2 hours and 57 minutes\npretty pretty good for him 50 mile open\nfemale Bata ransa she uh has

Whittier myself\nAddison Watley Austin Sullivan Dan\nMorris bryley Cobb Jamie Thompson and\nAlberto uh Marano so anyways great event\ngo check it out it happens every year\nright around the second week of right\naround the second week of September it's\nbased out of Dela Georgia out of the mon\nmono Winery so check it out great uh\ngreat\nevent gravel or single track they still\ndo they still put on a they still put on\na really good uh a really good event\nso race is over packed up headed back\nhome drove home that same night so got\nhome approximately 4:00 Sunday\nmorning uh so I could be back at work on\nMonday to uh to do all of this again so\nall right so home for 5 days and then\npacked up my stuff again and just was in\nJacksonville for the Florida state\nchampionship series round number two\nround number two in Jacksonville\nKatherine Abby Hannah Park first time I\nraced Hannah Park was in 1996 so I'm\npretty familiar with the\npark the travels for this because of my\ntraining schedule and working with\nclients uh I wasn't able to go there on\nSaturday to do my practice or to do my\nto do my pre-ride I don't think I was\nmissing out on a whole lot it has it's\nbeen raining here in Florida especially\nup in North Florida quite a bit so from\nwhat I heard from one of the local from\none of the locals there that on Thursday\nthey were even I'm sorry on Tuesday they\nwere even questioning were they going to\nbe able to hold an event because the\nwhole park was under four four to 5 in\nof water so I didn't make it up there\nSaturday day to do the pre-ride actually\nrode up I drove up Saturday got into got\nto the hotel about I don't know 10:30\n11:00 Saturday night got up nice and\nearly Sunday morning had breakfast with\none of my friends headed over to the\npark suit it up and then used Sunday\nmorning as my as my pre-ride of course\non Sunday man I thought it was\nabsolutely perfect like running running\non\nRails uh Abby Hannah Park is Believe It\nor Not is on the beach\nuh even though it's not that Sandy it's\nnot directly on the beach it's uh I\nwouldn't even know how a couple hundred\nyards from the beach but still a really\nreally fun park this course was about\n5.6\nmiles uh with a lot of turns I'm going\nto come back to the topic of turns a\nlittle bit later on in the in my\ndescription of of what we experienced in\nJacksonville so anyways couldn't ride\nthe park on Saturday rode the park on\nSunday I thought I thought the place was\namazing couple of Puddles maybe five or\nsix uh pretty good water\nCrossings uh some of them short enough\nthat you could manual that that you\ncould manual across other ones that were\na little bit longer that you couldn't\nmanual across and you just had to bury\nthe bike in it um and then one one main\nsection of Fire Road that's pretty long\nproximately I think I was clearing it in\nabout a little over a minute uh of just\na full gas full gas\nsection of 1 minute and then right back\ninto into single track again with a lot\nof turns I'm going to keep beating this\nturn thing to to death this particular\nrace I chose to use my race bike again\nsame thing same one that I used in in\nTallahassee same Tire configuration I\nrun the pelli XC RC\n2.4s reason I run 2.4s is a little bit\nhigher volume in the tire I could run a\nlittle bit less tire pressure to help me\nstay on top of some sections that were\nactually Sandy and then actually get\nover the roots a little bit better the\nbiggest the one of the biggest reasons\nfor running a little bit wider tire is I\ncan run less tire pressure so I'm 140\nlbs I prefer on my 2.4 tires I've run 14\nuh I'm sorry 15 psi in the front and\napproximately 19 in the rear I stayed\ntrue to those numbers this weekend in\nJacksonville or last weekend in\nJacksonville okay course is beautiful\nabsolutely perfect let's go let's go\nracing I'm ready to go my class does\nthree laps headed out for the first lap\nuh when when we refer to whole shot\nwhole shot simply means once the\npromoter Dave from Gone Gone riding once\nhe's uh Blows the Whistle it's the first\nperson to get into single track when the\nwhole pack Narrows down and Dives in\nsingle track that's when you're that's\nhow you define if you get the hole shot\nand sometimes in our descriptions we\ntalk whole shot to Checkers whole shot\nto Checkers means you never got passed\nyou got the whole shot you went and\nwoods in first you held your lead the\nentire time and never actually fell to\nsecond third or whatever whatever\nposition you might have you might have\nfallen to so got the whole shot went in\nthe woods and I'll tell you what man and\nin\nTallahassee there was somebody new\nsomebody new laying the heat down on me\nhis name's\nKeith Keith uh kept me honest in\nTallahassee I got him in the I got him\nin the long run and uh was able to crack\nhim as the day went on shows up again to\nthis race here in ja and man I could not\nShake him off of my wheel so I went ho\nshot and he sat there\nreally really pushing pushing me to to\nmy limits I I was I had a pretty good\ngrin on my face one grin in pain and\nanother grin of man I am digging this I\ncannot get rid of this\nguy first lap can't get rid of them\nsecond lap can't get rid of them if you\ngo on to go ring.com and you click\nresults you can actually see what our\nindividual lap times were just to see\nhow close they how close they were lap\nthree I finally I finally got a little\nbit of a gap just a little bit of a gap\nnow I'm going to refer in the next\nsegment when I talk to you about when I\nasked right in the beginning I said how\nare you with\ntraining how are you with mountain bike\ntraining I'm not\ntalking on your trainer doing intervals\nI'm talking practicing mountain bike\nhow this all ties together is I am not\ngreedy I'm trying to be better than my\ncompetition I clearly couldn't outride\nhim I'm trying or outow him outfitness\nhim I'm trying to be better through my\nefficiency inside the trail and like I\nsaid I'm not greedy I'm just trying to\nfind a\nquarter of 1\nsecond in every corner you know what\nforget about it\nnot in every corner we're going to go\nwith half the\ncorners this particular course from what\nI've heard it has somewhere around 200\nturns 200 Corners that we have to go\naround so it's it's really a tight\ntwisty\nPlace 200 Corners that we have to go\naround I don't want to be better at 200\nCorners I'm going to be better at 100\nCorners yeah I'm going to be better at\n100 corners corers and I only want a\nsecond just a quarter of one second to\nbe better than my\ncompetition 100 Corners not 200 100 of\nthem I'll screw\nup 100 Corners quarter of 1 second is 25\nseconds just because you're looking for\na quarter of a second quarter of a\nsecond to get 25 seconds over your\ncompetition that's the kind of focus\nthat I\nhave I tried to beat him in Fitness in\none couldn't do it tried to beat him in\nFitness in two couldn't do it had to get\na little bit smarter about how I was\nriding and was able to ride I think in\nmy third lap a little bit better than I\nhad in the other two sustain the same\nFitness that I that I had during the day\nand I was able to creep away keep away\nuh creep away from him and get the win\nbike held up perfect body health up\nperfect struggling a little bit with my\nwith my shoulder the my shoulder crash\nback in May some pain but nothing\nnothing that stops me from wanting to\nrace my bike or do the things that I'm\ntrying to do on a daily on a daily basis\nso that was it man Jacksonville\nJacksonville did not disappoint I\nthought the place was was amazing a lot\nof slick a lot of slick Roots but not\nenough to really pose as a problem like\nI said the mud Crossings not enough to\npose as a problem couple Bridge couple\nBridge\nCrossings not enough to really pose as a\nproblem one of the main reasons is guess\nwhat everybody's got to ride the same\nthing everybody's got to ride the same\nconditions so whether you got to walk\nsomething or you got to ride it as slow\nas you possibly can guess what we're all\nexperiencing the same thing so um so\nthat was that was it tallah has uh not\ntalah sorry tah was a week ago\nJacksonville did not uh did not\ndisappoint me nor do I think it\ndisappointed anybody else so let me just\nrun through this the results pretty\nquick Victor Alber won the open expert\nxc1 uh I believe he won in Tallahassee\nalso so he's he's got a a pretty\ncomfortable lead on the the group as far\nas points uh so he's in the leaders\njersey uh we have one weekend off and\nthen the following week going we're up\nin Dyer Dyer Park\nhere uh honorable mention to Ryan\nWoodall by the way\nRyan and Victor I've been racing with\nthese guys\nforever\nforever I'm not racing them anymore but\nforever I had a great opportunity to\nrace with them so two amazing\namazing talented guys that deserve\neverything they get and you know what\nI'll throw it in there too\nangel third place man and that kid is\nsomething else he's been with me\nfor I think since he's been six or seven\nyears old he's 18 now and man that dude\nhas got some Talent so kudos to to Angel\n40 plus 40 plus Seth zooki Seth also won\nin Tallahassee two weeks ago so he's got\nuh he's clearly got the points lead over\nAllison anos Allison got second to him\nin Tallahassee also so that should be a\npretty good battle between the between\nthe two of them going for the rest of\nthe rest of the series I got the win in\nthe 50 plus and then in the sport in the\nsport car category Mario got the one got\nthe win in the young\nclass uh 40 plus class Mt Kelly got the\nwin

in Jacksonville enjoy your\nweek\noff and uh let's get ready for dire Park\nin two weeks so all right last three\ntopics and then we'll and I'll let you\nmove on to more important things than\nsitting here listening to me rattle\nrattle off some pointless some Pointless\nStuff so I started the episode with do\nyou think you are\ntraining mountain biking or practicing\nmountain biking so one of the questions\nthat I consistently get at my local park\nsomebody will say to me hey Bob how fast\ndo you do a lap I race ride at Markham\nhow fast do you do a lap at Markham\nPark and my answer is I have no idea and\nthey look at me kind of\nstrange you you you probably should know\nand I go nope I have no\nidea why I've never done a lap of my\nlocal park from beginning to end I think\nand I believe it is absolutely\npointless here's why we're going to talk\nabout practice\ning any\nother practicing any other sport in this\nworld football I'm a fan of football\nfootball practice is this what the coach\ndoes all right team thanks for showing\nup today uh half of you guys are on that\nside of the field half of you on the\nother side of the field all right go\nahead and go play your game he stands\nback and he watches the entire game it's\nover and he goes all right guys thanks\nfor coming today see you tomorrow for\npractice not the game for practice\ntomorrow shows up he goes okay divide in\nhalf you guys take opposite sides of the\nfield go ahead and go play your\ngame sits back thanks guys great\npractice\ntoday and you go home there is not one\nsport in the world that you physically\ngo out and you play your game every\nsingle time you show up I have no idea\nit it it it completely baffles me as to\nwhy somebody thinks they're practicing\nmountain biking by going to their local\npark and timing how fast they do an\nentire lap so just for the sake of\nargument let's say a lap takes 40\nminutes of your local park and today\nyou're practicing mountain bike and\ntoday you've got 880 minutes to ride\nyour\nbike you head out for your first lap and\nit's 40 minutes great you turn around\nand you head back in for your second lap\nand your second lap is even\nbetter 39 minutes and 30 seconds man\nawesome practice today you got 30\nseconds faster in your second lap of a\n40 minute lap\nand you check the box that you're\npracticing mountain\nbiking my question to you would be if\nyou're so good at practicing mountain\nbiking by the way you're defining it\ntell me in lap\ntwo where you found 30 seconds to be\nbetter than you were in lap\none and by the way do not answer the\nquestion I pedal hard\nI'm not looking for that I guarantee you\nyou cannot tell me exactly where you\nfound 30 seconds to be\nfaster you went home that day you said\nokay this is great what a great day of\nbiking practicing my skills of mountain\nbiking let's get into what I believe the\ndefinition of practicing mountain biking\nis in some of the older in some of the\nolder videos that you've seen me put up\nI do a lot of them which I call my Moto\nMondays it's a group workout day\nabsolutely love it I get pushed\neverybody there that gets that gets uh\ngets pushed also how do we get pushed we\nget pushed through skills and fitness\nskills and fitness use the last one as\nthe exact same example 40 minutes 40\nminutes 80 minutes total how about about\nthis just for just for the sake of\nargument how about this I've got the\nsame 80 minutes to ride my bike today by\nthe way in your 80 minutes you hit every\nRock route bumping corner twice and this\nis probably what happened oh man I\nreally sucked around that\ncorner I'm going to be back in 40\nminutes and I'm going to make sure I get\nbetter in that corner guess what you're\nnot you're going to blow through that\ncorner the exact same way and by the way\nin mountain biking we're we're very\nfortunate that you have to learn why\nbecause every corner is different every\ncorner has different angles to it every\ncorner has different soil conditions but\nthat day you sucked the first time you\nwent around the corner you came back 40\nI'm sorry you're faster that lap you\ncame back 39 minutes later 39 and 1 12\nminutes later to the same section and\nnow you blew the same corner and guess\nwhat you still sucked at it but man you\ndid a great job of practicing mountain\nbike practicing mountain biking that day\ngood job man way to practice how about\nthis how about this and I'm not even\ngoing to take it to the extremes that I\ndo you've got 80 minutes to ride your\ntoday how about finding an 8 minute\nsection of Trail linked together a\ncouple different Trails how about\nfinding an 8 minute section of Trail s\nand doing it 10 times oh my God guess\nwhat you're still riding your bike for\n80 minutes you're still developing your\nFitness for 80 minutes you're doing an\namazing job of\npracticing practicing mountain\nbiking so instead of hitting Corners\ntwice you hitting them 10 times 8 Minute\nlap 10 times 80 minutes still getting\nFitness but guess what 10 times through\nthe same corner you start to\nexperiment with three topics that I'm\ngoing to beat beat you to death with\ndeath uh beat you to death with lines\nlegs and limbs this is a Mardi training\ntopic I'll get more into these topics in\nlater in later episodes but one of them\nrefer to is line selection line\nselection means is that front wheel\nexactly where you wanted it to be I\nguarantee you when you suck it cornering\nyou don't know where the front wheel was\nand by the way doing it twice you\nhaven't learned where where your front\nwheel needs to be doing it 10 times\nyou're probably more likely to learn a\nlittle bit something about tire pressure\nlean angle of the bike body position\nbraking where you're looking all of\nthese things to help you get a little\nbit\nbetter one of the uh a background that I\nhave is in Motocross so I raced I raced\nBMX flat land freestyle Motocross and\nthen got into to mountain biking from\nthere in Motocross we used to run laps 3\nminute laps 2 minutes and 30 seconds and\nI'll tell you what you kick the crap out\nof yourself to try and make 2 minute and\n30 to make it 2 minute and 29\nseconds but guess what you did 10 12 14\nof these laps or 10 10 or 12 of these\nlaps trying to get better and better and\nbetter and learning about it so again\nhow do you Define practicing mountain\nbiking and I guarantee you you're all\ndescri you're all defining how you're\npracticing mountain biking wrong\nintervals you're not\npracticing mountain biking pushing your\nbody to the Limit you're not practicing\nmountain biking I'm going to close with\nthis sentence on this topic of how do\nyou train and practice mountain\nbiking do not practice avoid avoidance\nnobody's got to teach you\navoidance what is avoidance avoidance\nsimply means when you go to your local\npark you're going to see a rock garden\nyou're going to see a cluster of roots\nand the very first thing you're going to\nsee is the line that goes around all of\nit that is not\nbiking change your thoughts\nprocess change your skills change the\nway you practice and I guarantee you I\nabsolutely guarantee you you will get\nbetter at this\nsport all right last two\ntopics first one that we've tried to do\nevery week together the what's in your\nwater bottle same thing I get asked on a\npretty regular basis Bob what's in your\nwater bottle bottle what's the what's\nthe\nsecret so I like to share the secret\nthat's in my water\nbottles what's in your water bottle bob\nevery week we have the same thing I'm\ntelling you exactly what's\nin my water bottle so I put a note every\ntime I have a thought about what's in my\nwater bottle\nnever ever\nsatisfied Never Satisfied constantly\ncritiquing the work that I do and not\nbeing complacent always believing that\nthere's an opportunity to be better and\ndo\nmore Never\nSatisfied next\none\ndedication dedication simply means when\nthat alarm clock goes off at 3:50 in the\nmorning every single day dedication\nmeans I don't have a choice I have to\nget up and I have to train I'm dedicated\nto the sport I've been dedicated to it\nfor decades now very blessed that I have\nthe results that I do but I do put in a\nlot of consistent hard work be dedicated\nto your to your sport be dedicated to\nthe process know that you don't start\ntraining today and become fast tomorrow\nthis is a sport that takes a lot and lot\na lot of\ndedication all right final topic we're\ngoing to wrap things up here this is the\none that I love and I'll tell you what\nin Tallahassee in Fool's Gold in\nJacksonville the feedback that I'm from\ngetting from this from people just makes\nme it makes me smile here we go wood w l\nD- a w racing what does w racing means w\nsimply means that I listen in the padic\nabout what goes on with everybody out\nthere and I constantly hear the W I\nwould have done better\nif I would have finished here had this\nnot happened I would have and I'm going\nman come on you got you got to own you\ngot to own the day learn to be better so\nlet's do some wood erasing at Fool's\nGold up into Monica Georgia number three\nthese are three topics number one the\none that really number one is going to\nbe the one that that kind of set me off\nthe most that I was digging number\nthree I haven't been\ntraining are you\nserious I haven't been\ntraining good thing glad glad that's\nwhat you chose to share me with me at a\nor with somebody at a mountain bike\nGrace\nnumber two wood a rasing at Fool's\nGold that\none Rocky\ndescent really kicked my\nass that one Rocky descent really kicked\nmy\nass okay so we don't like descending\nRocky things that's okay that's\ngreat and the number one thing that I\nheard the number one wood erasing that I\nheard up at fool's gold was my chain\nfell\noff\ntwice on the\ndownhill my chain fell off\ntwice on the downhill I had to stop and\nfix it I would have done a lot better so\nwith regards to what a racing and Fool's\nGold guess what if you had been training\nif that Rocky descent didn't kick your\nass and your chain stayed on the\nbike you're not guaranteed to have done\nany better than you actually\ndid own your\ntraining own your process and own your\nresults and the final one let's get into\nthe W rasing Jacksonville FSC round two\nagain top three things number three\nthose\nwet Muddy Roots killed me sliding all\nover the\nplace okay not I'm going to go\nthere number\ntwo man these Bridges I had to slow down\nevery time I had to cross the bridges it\nwas just killing my momentum\noh I didn't realize you were the only\none that was going over these Bridges\nand your momentum was getting killed\nand number\none I don't Corner that\ngood okay I think that ties That\nsummarizes the whole topic today about\npracticing mountain biking Jacksonville\nhas 200 Corners you got to be prepared\nfor cornering and guess what mountain\nbiking requires one thing and requires a\ncouple things requires one main thing\ncornering\ncornering all right so by the\nway if you're pretty good at those muddy\nwet\nRoots if you didn't have to slow\ndown to go over the\nbridges\nand if you actually knew how to\nCorner you're not guaranteed to do any\nbetter than you actually\ndid own the process own the results\ndon't make excuses es get out there and\ntrain excuses to me are a sign of\nweakness this episode was brought to you\nby\nuclo U cycling yuu cycling.com so if
