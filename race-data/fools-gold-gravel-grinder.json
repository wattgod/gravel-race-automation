Wine country setting at Montaluce adds post-race exploration beyond typical gravel road grinding."
      },
      "prestige": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Marketed as mountain bike race by Mountain Goat Adventures, not positioned in gravel elite circles.

Capped field size keeps it local-focused."
      },
      "race_quality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Rain route requirement shows planning for trail conditions, with alternate Southern Cross Course when Bull and Jake trails are saturated. USDA Forest Service permit protocols and multiuse trail management suggest professional operations. However, rigid registration cutoffs and limited communication windows reduce flexibility."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Fast flowy singletrack through Bull And Jake Mountain trails with legitimate descents and two major sustained climbs. Starting at Montaluce Winery adds wine country ambiance that softens the suffering. The mix of pavement and dirt keeps you honest without being revolutionary."
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Regional southeastern event with dedicated Facebook following and tiered pricing that rewards early commitment. Mountain Goat Adventures has built a loyal local crew, but it stays firmly in the Georgia mountains bubble. Solid for making friends, weak for building your cycling resume."
      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "300-rider cap with pricing tiers suggests decent local turnout but zero national pull. No pro field data available because there isn't one worth mentioning. You're racing weekend warriors and regional MTB crossover athletes, not gravel's heavy hitters."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Tiered pricing from $110-130 for 54 miles includes boxed lunch, beer, and primitive camping at Montaluce Winery. Early commitment pricing rewards planning ahead. Course delivers singletrack descents and wine country infrastructure that most regional races can't match for the entry fee."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Dahlonega sits 80 miles from Atlanta airport, so factor in rental car costs and mountain lodging premiums. September timing avoids peak leaf season pricing but still commands Georgia mountain rates. Wine country location means you'll pay tourist prices for everything."
