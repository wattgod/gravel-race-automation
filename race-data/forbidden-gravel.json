Three distance options (Piccolo ~40km, Medio ~60km, Esperto ~104km) provide choice, but the longest sits in that weekend warrior zone without pushing epic boundaries. More compact than Grinduro."
      },
      "technicality": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "The race opens with a critical right turn into fast singletrack where elite positioning matters immediately. Chad Grice describes hike-a-bike sections where 'we got to a steep and loose section and both had to dismount' with a dozen dismounts on the major climb alone. Similar technical demands to Gravel Worlds. As Chad Grice puts it: \"The second climb of the day was by far the most outrageous climb I have done in a gravel race.\""

      "elevation": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "4000 feet over 55 miles means real climbing without being ridiculous — about 73 feet per mile. The Forbidden Plateau Road climb is likely where you'll earn your finisher's medal. It's elevation that'll test your gearing choices without requiring oxygen masks. Similar elevation profile to Gravel Worlds."
      },
      "climate": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Historical weather data shows average highs of 68°F and lows of 51°F, with a 45% chance of rain on any given day. The 2025 race was postponed from September 7 to September 21 due to worsening fire risk and access restrictions. Vancouver Island September weather remains unpredictable enough to force last-minute organizational changes when conditions deteriorate. More weather exposure than Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."
      },
      "altitude": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Starting from Cumberland near sea level, even the Forbidden Plateau Road climb won't reach physiologically significant altitude. The 1,000m+ climbing challenge comes from gradient and surface conditions, not thin air effects. Lower altitude than Gravel Worlds — no thin-air concerns."
      },
      "adventure": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Riding gravel roads named after forbidden plateaus on a remote Canadian island has adventure appeal. The expanded route along Puntledge River and climb up terrain rugged enough to postpone races suggests you'll earn some stories. It's not Patagonia, but it's real wilderness riding without the safety net of civilization every few miles. As Course Access puts it: \"The series offers exclusive private gravel roads in the remote wilderness, which feature muscle aching terrain, but also awe-inspiring views that can only be found on the West Coast of BC.\""
      },
      "prestige": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Part of the BC Gravel Series but nobody's putting this on their bucket list. It's a rider-favorite in Canada, but that's like being the tallest person in a kindergarten class. The 2025 race got postponed after a 'risk assessment' — not the kind of thing that builds legend status."
      },
      "race_quality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Jon Watkin's organization provides three distance options with full aid station support and neutral mechanical backup. However, the 2025 fire-related postponement and route changes suggest the operation is still finding its footing with land management logistics."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "You get the Puntledge River route and a climb up Forbidden Plateau Road, which sounds decent on paper. But this feels more like a nice weekend ride with timing chips than a transformative gravel experience. The Vancouver Island setting has potential, but execution seems to lag behind the scenery."
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Mosaic Forest Management partners with local municipalities to make it 'as community-focused as it gets' with dining promos and 11am-3pm food trucks plus awards. The series draws multi-event participants but lacks the deep grassroots following of established races."
      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "With a field of 50-100 riders, no mention of notable winners, pros, or competitive depth anywhere in the research. When a gravel race can't name a single standout performer or doesn't attract talent worth mentioning, you're looking at a participation trophy field. The BC Gravel Series circuit isn't drawing international firepower. Thinner field than Ouray Gravel Grinder. As Key Tactical Note puts it: \"The initial 50km whittled the front of the field down to just five riders in the lead pack.\""
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Three distance options with full aid stations, neutral mechanical support, post-race food trucks, and camping options from $10-30 provide solid package value. Local dining partnerships and multi-event BC Gravel Series discounts up to 15% extend the value proposition."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Registration runs $75-100 CAD. Cumberland on Vancouver Island requires ferry costs or flights, plus accommodation in a small town without extensive lodging infrastructure. The race itself appears reasonably priced with camping options, but getting there involves significant travel logistics and costs. Higher total cost than Badlands."
