        "explanation": "Hannah Otto captured the strategic complexity: \"After pre-riding a lap earlier in the week, I actually had to take a step back, re-evaluate my plan, and anticipate a much longer race than I initially thought.\" The 70-mile distance creates tactical demands where positioning matters significantly. Otto noted that \"even though the race would last approximately five hours, the race would be extremely tactical – and the start, extremely critical.\" Similar distance to Crusher in the Tushar."

        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Rachel Hwang describes the course as \"very much XC style\" with \"singletrack being very mellow, hard packed dirt, and flowy with nothing technical.\" The official description emphasizes \"sandy climbs and flowy singletrack of the Fort Ord National Monument.\" Hannah Otto's flat tire at mile 50 shows the technical demands: \"the flat was on the bead. I tried to use a tire plug, but it wouldn't hold.\" Similar technical demands to Gravel Worlds."

        "explanation": "The official course delivers \"approximately 70 miles and 7,800 feet of elevation change\" over two laps, with each single lap gaining 3,500 feet. This cumulative climbing load creates serious fatigue, as Rachel Hwang experienced: \"While the first lap went ok, as soon as the second lap started, I bonked. When my legs were pedaling with the power it knew it could on the first lap, my lungs felt closed and I couldn't breathe fully.\" More climbing than SBT GRVL at the same score."

March 2023 pre-ride conditions showed the variable weather challenges: webdev511 reported \"lots of wet and goopy parts\" with water \"running right down the middle of the trail.\" Jolyzara encountered \"vernal pools are full and overflowing onto the trails in some places.\" April conditions can swing dramatically, creating unpredictable race-day scenarios from mud pits to heat spikes. Similar climate challenges to SBT GRVL."

      "altitude": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Fort Ord's coastal California location presents zero altitude concerns for riders. The course maximum elevation remains well below 1,000 feet, allowing riders to perform at full sea-level capacity throughout the event without any physiological challenges related to elevation. Lower altitude than Gravel Worlds — no thin-air concerns."

        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Fort Ord National Monument provides distinctive character as former military training grounds. The course includes varied terrain transitions, as Rachel Hwang noted the mix of \"decent gravel roads\" with flowy singletrack sections. webdev511 praised the venue: \"Fort Ord is a great place\" for testing equipment and skills, with the historic landscape offering unique riding through repurposed military terrain."
