        "explanation": "The 100km distance creates strategic complexity on Fort Ord's terrain. webdev511 observed \"Passing opportunities on singletrack = slim to none. You do it, it's going to be a ballsy move.\" Two laps mean position early matters significantly more than in single-loop races."

        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "webdev511 describes specific challenges: \"Second part of the course has a LOT of deep speed sucking sand washes. Like a dozen at least.\" The combination of sand sections, water crossings, and rutted descents creates moderate technical demands without extreme exposure."

      "altitude": {
        "score": 1,

        "score": 4,

        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "The Life Time Grand Prix field size reduction to \"25 men and 25 women initially, with three wild cards added after UNBOUND\" creates an elite racing community. The broader Sea Otter Classic draws thousands across cycling disciplines for festival participation."

        "score": 5,
        "explanation": "Elite international competition defines the field quality.

      "value": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Premium Life Time pricing includes 4-day festival access, parking, and race-day lunch, but costs add up quickly. The complete Sea Otter expo experience and Leadville qualifier status justify expenses for serious competitors, though casual participants may find better value elsewhere."
