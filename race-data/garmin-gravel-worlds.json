Wollmann completed the 300-mile ultra in 21:53, hanging with the front group until mile 12 before \"pretty much solo work with a passer-by to chat with the entire night.\" The 150-mile had a 35% DNF rate in 2024's heat."

The technical challenge comes from managing speed over endless rollers rather than handling skills through rock gardens or technical features."

KCBikeNerd reported \"mile 60-120 right into a furnace headwind\" that \"slaughtered the mid/tail end of the 'party pace' folks.\" Wollmann began \"to stop sweating, developed a headache, and the cramps got worse\" before needing an IV at the finish. The heat forecast caused 250-300 original registrants to drop to shorter distances."

      "altitude": {
        "score": 1,

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "The 300-mile ultra starts at 5pm Friday for an all-night adventure through Nebraska's \"rolling gravel seas.\" Wollmann describes \"yelling out loud to wake up\" during the dark hours and hiking his bike around a train blocking the road at mile 250. The self-supported format means gas station stops and strategic naps, though the terrain itself offers agricultural grinding rather than wilderness exploration."

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "World championship jerseys for the 150-mile winners and 16 years of history give Gravel Worlds regional credibility. The Vegan Cyclist's appearance and \"a lot of familiar faces and names in the ultra community\" suggest growing recognition. However, the field depth remains modest with ~150 starters in the flagship distance, indicating it hasn't reached the status of gravel's premier events."

        "explanation": "Aid stations are \"VERY well stocked\" with \"almost anything you could ask for\" including free hot dogs and brats offered by locals. The fairgrounds venue upgrade shows organizational improvement. However, course marking reliability issues requiring GPS backup and the multi-sport weekend format spreading focus across various disciplines prevent this from reaching elite race standards."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "The multi-day festival atmosphere at the fairgrounds creates a proper gravel celebration. Wollmann describes the pre-race ritual of pasta at Napoli's Haymarket and drinks at Starlite Lounge. The \"First To Last\" philosophy ensures every finisher gets celebrated equally, with medical tents providing free IVs for heat casualties. Three distance options accommodate different ambitions within the same weekend event structure."

        "explanation": "\"Gravel worlds is one of the races that's dedicated to preserving the founding principle of gravel that we celebrate first place to last place equally,\" explains coordinator Hannah Shell. Wollmann notes the \"outpouring of support from everyone\" visible through phone notifications during the race. The event maintains gravel's original \"adventure, not so much a competition\" ethos while building a 16-year community around shared suffering."

Elite categories exist with dedicated start times, but no notable pro winners are documented. The ultra-distance events draw \"familiar faces and names in the ultra community\" according to Wollmann, suggesting a specialized rather than broadly competitive field."

        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Multiple distance options and the multi-day festival format provide flexibility for different rider goals and budgets. Trophy payouts extend to all categories rather than just elite placings. The well-stocked aid stations, free medical support, and \"VERY well stocked aid station\" at mile 270 of the ultra course demonstrate substantial included support services, though specific registration fees weren't available for comparison."

      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Lincoln's cost of living keeps accommodation reasonable, with Wollmann staying at the Graduate by Hilton Hotels. The centralized fairgrounds venue eliminates shuttle costs and provides ample parking. Pre-race dining options like Napoli's Haymarket offer standard pricing, and the Nebraska location generally provides manageable travel and lodging expenses compared to destination resort race locations."
