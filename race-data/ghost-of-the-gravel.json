The extensive gear recommendations (rain cape, wind jacket, shower cap, full-fingered gloves) reflect the need to prepare for multiple weather scenarios, adding equipment costs. Remote location and international travel requirements inflate total trip expenses beyond the race entry fee. Higher total cost than Badlands."
