        "explanation": "The course features \"packed clay gravel with a few sections of looser gravel\" through Alberta foothills, requiring attention on Forestry Trunk Road 40's \"blind corners.\" Organizers note this section \"has been used as a timed section in Western Canada's Rally West circuit,\" but the technical demands remain accessible rather than advanced, focusing on power delivery over bike handling skills."

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "The course crosses the Little Red Deer river and includes sections where riders encounter wild horses on climbs, with organizers noting these animals hold \"the true Strava KoM.\" Cell coverage gaps require self-sufficiency, and the route traverses ranch valleys through Alberta backcountry, though the adventure feels more like scenic countryside than wilderness exploration."

FatBoySlim's detailed nutrition strategy (6 gels, perogies, bacon at feed stations) and cramping battle at 77km illustrate the self-reliance required. The finish at Water Valley's community hall delivers \"exhausted, mud-flecked smiles\" and post-race BBQ atmosphere that riders like trevorrr simply call a \"great event.\""

However, FatBoySlim's 114th place finish in 2019 suggests limited field size, and the domestic championship status hasn't yet attracted significant international depth."

The experience includes wild horses, river crossings, and a post-race BBQ in historic Water Valley. While entry fees aren't published, the authentic community atmosphere and championship-level course design provide strong experience-to-cost ratio."

      "expenses": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Getting to Water Valley, Alberta requires Calgary airport access and unknown lodging arrangements in a small foothills town. The extensive gear recommendations (rain cape, wind jacket, shower cap, full-fingered gloves) reflect the need to prepare for multiple weather scenarios, adding equipment costs. Remote location and international travel requirements inflate total trip expenses beyond the race entry fee."
