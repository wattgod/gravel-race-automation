August conditions in eastern Ontario proved manageable in recent years, with consistently low DNF rates of 3-6% across categories. The stable finish times suggest weather hasn't been a major factor in recent editions. More weather exposure than Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

        "score": 2,

        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Top Epic finishers Stephen Chapman, Bayden Pritchard, and William Goodfellow finished within one second, showing tactical racing at the front. However, the 49-rider Epic field remains regional in scope without documented elite depth. Thinner field than Ouray Gravel Grinder."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "The Highland Games partnership delivers unique spectator atmosphere and festival access alongside the cycling event. Three distance options (42km-114km) at $80-110 CAD provide solid value for the distinctive finish experience."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Registration runs $50-75 CAD. Maxville, Ontario isn't a resort destination, so lodging costs stay reasonable. Being part of the Highland Games means you're competing with festival-goers for accommodations, but eastern Ontario doesn't command Montreal or Toronto pricing. The 'no refunds, no transfers' policy means you better be committed once you register. Similar expense level to Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

The course incorporates maintained gravel roads through municipally designated conservation forests. Some unmaintained sections may need time to dry out, though riders found them solid even when wet. The race finishes dramatically on the oval track at the Highland Games fairgrounds in front of grand stands with crowds cheering. Heat is a significant factor requiring lots of water and cooling strategies. The event features a neutral start through downtown Maxville before the competitive portion begins. Aid stations provide water support throughout the course."
