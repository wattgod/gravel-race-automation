        "score": 2,

        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "This remains a regional Ontario event, though integration with the Highland Games provides unique spectator atmosphere. Growing from 96 to 128 participants shows local credibility, but it's not a destination race drawing national fields."

      "experience": {
        "score": 2,

        "score": 2,

        "explanation": "Top Epic finishers Stephen Chapman, Bayden Pritchard, and William Goodfellow finished within one second, showing tactical racing at the front. However, the 49-rider Epic field remains regional in scope without documented elite depth."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "The Highland Games partnership delivers unique spectator atmosphere and festival access alongside the cycling event. Three distance options (42km-114km) at $80-110 CAD provide solid value for the distinctive finish experience."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Maxville, Ontario isn't a resort destination, so lodging costs stay reasonable. Being part of the Highland Games means you're competing with festival-goers for accommodations, but eastern Ontario doesn't command Montreal or Toronto pricing. The 'no refunds, no transfers' policy means you better be committed once you register."
