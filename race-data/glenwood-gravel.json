        "explanation": "2020 results show times ranging from Lucas Barloon's 2:41:34 win to 7:26+ for back-of-pack finishers with median around 4 hours. Regional Iowa racing in August isn't drawing national competitive depth."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Single race entry starts at $40 early registration, which is reasonable for chip timing and aid station support. The $399 full season pass for seven races plus meals and gear is good math. Hard to complain about Iowa pricing."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Glenwood, Iowa won't bankrupt you on lodging or dining compared to destination races. Late registration bumps to $50-70 depending on package, but that's standard race tax for procrastination."
