        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "65 miles sits in the sweet spot between sprint and suffer-fest. For comparison, the documented Ozarks gravel routes run 20-23 miles each with significant elevation - this distance respects both your time and pain threshold."

        "score": 4,

        "score": 1,

      },
      "race_quality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Hard to judge race quality when the event seems to exist in the shadow of better-organized Arkansas races. The Ozarks have the terrain to deliver, but without clear organization details or rider testimonials, this feels like someone's good intention that hasn't matured into solid execution. Other regional events like Doom get the buzz for a reason."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Eureka Springs provides Victorian architecture and mountain town atmosphere that doesn't disappoint. The terrain delivers with documented routes showing 85-99% gravel surfaces, but race-specific experience details remain unconfirmed."
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Arkansas gravel riders show up and suffer together without drama. Documented events feature brewery partnerships like Rapp's Barren Brewing for social gatherings, suggesting regional community exists even if this specific race hasn't built tribal identity."
      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Regional drawing pool from Arkansas, Missouri, and Oklahoma without major competition magnet status. Documented Ozarks events attract weekend warriors and local fast riders rather than national-level fields."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Likely priced like regional fondos with reasonable entry fees and basic support. Eureka Springs offers tourist pricing for pickup truck budgets rather than Range Rover wallets - you'll get suffering over swag."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Arkansas keeps costs reasonable - cheap gas, available motels, and food that won't require a second mortgage. Eureka Springs tourist pricing stays grounded for people who drive trucks, not luxury vehicles."
