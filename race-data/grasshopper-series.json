Attracts World Cup pros like Kate Courtney, Peter Stetina, and US gravel national champion Brennan Wertz. Not major series or UCI, but historic significance and strong reputation."

        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Professional organization from founder Miguel Crawford with well-stocked aid stations (Skratch, GU, grilled cheese sandwiches), course marshals, SAG support for emergencies, and clear categories. Points system rewards consistency across the series. Smooth registration with series pass options and junior discounts."

        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Five unique events through stunning Northern California landscapes - from the redwoods of Montgomery Woods to coastal views at King Ridge, flowing singletrack in Jackson Forest, and remote gravel through the Sacramento Valley. Each Hopper has its own character. The emphasis on bicycle diversity, artistry, and personal challenge creates memorable race days."

Forum comments rave: 'Best group ride vibe around' and 'So much better than any Fondo.' Welcomes everyone from beginners to World Cup pros. Team classification encourages group participation. The 'Hopper Super Hero King, Queen and Rider of the Universe' title says it all."

Group discounts, junior discounts, and early-bird pricing available. First 50 women get additional $50 off. Quality aid stations, medals, coffee prizes, and sponsor swag add value."

Not budget-friendly for out-of-state travelers, but reasonable for the region."

      "climate": {

The elevation gain sits somewhere between 4,500-9,116 feet depending on which Hopper you're riding, but the real challenge is the constant terrain switching that turns your legs into confused mush.",

Show up on the wrong bike or without solid handling skills, and you'll spend 70 miles getting schooled."
