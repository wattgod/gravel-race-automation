Stephen Vogel notes Low Gap features \"22 miles of road followed by 22 miles of dirt\" with a \"20 minute road climb from the gun.\" Squarely in the 60-100 mile category for most events, with shorter options available.

Low Gap presents technical challenges including \"downhill, one lane, pot-holed road with grades up to 12% and plenty of damp hairpins... a minefield of pot holes.\" Amy Cameron describes Old Caz requiring riders to \"slosh across the creek\" mid-race.

Multiple events feature 6,000-8,000+ ft of elevation gain with pitches exceeding 12%.
