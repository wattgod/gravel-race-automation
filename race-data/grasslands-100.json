      },
      "race_quality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Can't rate what isn't there. The trail run version uses \"non-technical, very runnable\" equestrian trails shared with horses and cows through 20,000+ acres of LBJ National Grasslands. That's fine for runners, but gravel bikes? Good luck explaining that to your derailleur."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "If this mythical gravel version existed, rolling through North Texas grasslands past livestock could be genuinely cool. The trail run covers 45 miles of non-overlapping terrain through pine groves, oak stands, and open fields. But you'll be doing it on foot, not wheels."
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "The running event shows zero reviews on RaceRaves after 25+ years, which tells you something. North Texas trail runners seem to keep this as their quiet tradition on the third weekend of March. No evidence any cycling community even knows this place exists."
      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Field size is completely unknown, but this is fundamentally a regional trail running event near Decatur, Texas—not exactly a magnet for elite gravel talent. The running version offers buckles for sub-20 and sub-24 hour finishes, suggesting a pretty recreational crowd."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Entry fees aren't public, but trail runs typically cost less than gravel races. You'd get access to 20,000 acres of rolling grassland with aid stations and night support. Problem is, you'd be the only person on a bike at a running race."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Decatur sits about an hour north of Fort Worth, so DFW airport access is reasonable. North Texas lodging and food won't break the bank. But travel costs are irrelevant when the race you want doesn't exist in the first place."
      },
      "length": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "100 miles is proper distance for serious suffering. The trail run version gives you 30 hours to finish, which is generous even for walking. If this were actually a gravel race, the distance would be the one thing they got right."
      },
      "technicality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Equestrian trails designed to be \"very runnable\" and \"non-technical\" aren't going to challenge anyone. The research explicitly calls this gentle terrain suitable for first-time trail users. Your biggest obstacle would be explaining to cattle why you're on a bike at their running event."
      },
      "elevation": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "3,500 feet over 100 miles is 35 feet per mile—basically flat with gentle rolling hills. North Texas grasslands don't offer mountains, just enough ups and downs to keep blood moving. The trail run lists 4,000 feet, so even the elevation gain is borrowed from the wrong sport."
      },
      "climate": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Late March in North Texas means unpredictable weather—could be 40 degrees and raining or 80 and windy. No historical weather data available, but this is tornado season in a region known for dramatic temperature swings. Plan for everything, get surprised anyway."
      },
      "altitude": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Decatur, Texas sits around 1,000-1,200 feet above sea level. You'll get more altitude gain walking up stairs to your hotel room. Altitude isn't a factor here unless you're coming from Death Valley."
      },
      "logistics": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "DFW airport access puts you within an hour of the LBJ National Grasslands starting point at TADRA Point. But packet pickup details, parking, and lodging info are completely unknown. Hard to plan logistics for a race that exists only in someone's imagination."
      },
      "adventure": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Rolling through 20,000+ acres of protected grassland past grazing livestock sounds genuinely adventurous. Pine groves, oak stands, and open prairie offer real variety in a landscape most people never see. Too bad you'd have to invent the race first to experience it on two wheels."
