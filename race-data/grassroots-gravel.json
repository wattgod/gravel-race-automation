October in Pueblo means fall weather at elevation with potential temperature swings. The race starts downtown at Main Street and Alan Hamel Avenue, providing some urban shelter before heading into open country exposure. More weather exposure than Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

Modest altitude compared to Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

Competitive sprints between sponsored teams show regional depth but limited national elite participation. Thinner field than Ouray Gravel Grinder.
