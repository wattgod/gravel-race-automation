        "explanation": "Three aid stations spread across 48km for The Wellington Rocks indicates modest field expectations rather than competitive density.

      },
      "value": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "The NSW Government site lists it as 'free' which either means spectating or they're underselling their own race entry fees. If registration is actually cheap, 65 miles of Australian granite country for minimal cash outlay delivers decent bang for buck. Just don't expect premium race services at budget pricing."
