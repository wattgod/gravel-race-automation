The granite country terrain provides sustained vertical challenge."

        "explanation": "Jacob rode through active snowfall: \"I spent the next 15 minutes grinding in my lowest gear with snow falling off the trees as we ascended,\" with \"muddy and sloppy\" conditions creating traction challenges. The May date change specifically targets \"cooler weather\" after previous timing proved problematic for rider comfort."

      "altitude": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "NSW granite country elevations stay within manageable bands while delivering mountain character.

        "explanation": "Basket Swamp Bash creek crossing and sweeping national park views deliver backcountry character.

Creek depths vary with conditions, adding weather-dependent adventure elements."

        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Todd Meerdink worried that losing the lead group early would turn \"this race would quickly turn into just a group ride,\" indicating thin competitive depth. The explicit welcome for adaptive bikes and e-bikes alongside traditional categories prioritizes inclusivity over racing field strength in this regional NSW event."

      "value": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "The NSW Government site lists it as 'free' which either means spectating or they're underselling their own race entry fees. If registration is actually cheap, 65 miles of Australian granite country for minimal cash outlay delivers decent bang for buck. Just don't expect premium race services at budget pricing."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Multi-bike welcome policy means riders can use existing mountain bikes rather than buying gravel-specific equipment, with Todd Meerdink successfully using 40mm tires on technical sections. Rural Tenterfield location requires travel from major cities, while Todd's Camelback strategy shows self-sufficient riders can minimize aid station dependencies."
