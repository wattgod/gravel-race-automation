        "explanation": "The race has bounced between three start locations in nine years and postponed the entire 2025 edition, suggesting organizational instability. Despite elite riders like Brodie Chapman declaring it \"the most fun I've had on a bike – ever!\", basic logistics like packet pickup and parking remain undocumented."

      "length": {
        "score": 5,
        "explanation": "The men's 155km distance with 41.2km of gravel delivers serious one-day racing standards that expose fitness gaps. Add the Saturday Team Time Trial component and you're getting a proper two-day challenge that tests endurance over varied terrain through the Pohangina Valley. Among the longest in gravel, comparable to Badlands."
      },
      "technicality": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Jordan Rapp emphasizes that \"gravel riding is almost entirely about two things: tire choice and tire pressure\" – skills that matter on the 25% gravel sections through Pohangina watersheds. The mixed 75% sealed, 25% gravel format tests bike handling without being pure technical mountain bike territory. Similar technical demands to Gravel Worlds."
      },
      "elevation": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "6562 feet over 99 miles averages about 66 feet per mile – noticeable climbing through the Pohangina Valley watersheds without being Alpine brutal. The elevation profile matters tactically for race selection but won't break riders purely on gradient. Similar elevation profile to Gravel Worlds."
      },
      "climate": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Mid-November timing in New Zealand's Manawatū region means late spring conditions that could vary significantly. No specific weather incidents appear in race reports, suggesting conditions are generally rideable though potentially unpredictable. Similar climate challenges to SBT GRVL."
      },
      "altitude": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "The Manawatū-Whanganui region sits near sea level with no meaningful altitude training benefits or breathing challenges. Racing through Pohangina Valley watersheds doesn't reach high country elevations. Lower altitude than Gravel Worlds — no thin-air concerns."
      },
      "adventure": {
        "score": 5,
        "explanation": "Joel Meintjes notes that gravel bikes \"simply load and go\" when \"tar becomes rock-strewn\" – exactly what happens on the mixed Pohangina Valley terrain. Brodie Chapman's podium declaration of \"most fun I've had on a bike – ever!\" suggests this delivers memorable adventure beyond just checking off another race."
      },
      "prestige": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "UCI Oceania Tour 1.2 status since 2018 draws international recognition and teams hunting early season points. The event earned Cycling New Zealand's Shona Smith Award for equal prize money contributions to women's cycling, though postponing 2025 entirely doesn't project bulletproof organizational prestige."
      },
      "race_quality": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "The gravel sectors through Pohangina Valley fracture pelotons with punctures and crashes, creating the kind of attrition that separates contenders from pretenders. Jess Pratt's enthusiasm about the Zwift Academy opportunity that brought her here reflects the caliber of racing that develops careers."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Starting and finishing in Ashhurst village with Team Time Trial format adds tactical depth beyond pure suffering. The Greasy Chain Charitable Trust organization aims to help \"all New Zealanders become fitter through cycling,\" creating purpose beyond just race day experience."
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "The gravel community's \"trauma-bonding\" through \"shared struggle and triumph\" creates \"unspoken, helmet-bopping understanding\" among riders. Nine years of operation (minus COVID 2022 and 2025 postponement) with international teams returning shows staying power in building cycling community connections."
      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "With a field of 300-500 riders, past winners include WorldTour-level riders like Brodie Chapman and rising talents like Niamh Fisher-Black, with international squads from Sweden, Japan, US, and Australia hunting UCI points. The race has served as a launching pad for Zwift Academy winners advancing to professional cycling careers. Similar competitive depth to Rule of Three."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 5,
        "explanation": "Two-day format with varied distances (155km men's, 91km women's) plus Team Time Trial offers multiple engagement opportunities. Equal prize money for men's and women's races earned recognition with the Shona Smith Award, demonstrating commitment to value across all participants."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Registration runs NZ$150-$200. Flying to New Zealand for racing isn't cheap from major markets, and the race's location moves between small towns suggest limited lodging options. Jordan Rapp's detailed tire testing shows elite-level preparation costs – Quarq TyreWiz pressure monitoring systems and multiple tire setups for optimal performance. Higher total cost than Badlands."

      "should_you_race": "If you can handle 99 miles where the gravel sectors exist specifically to fracture the field and leave riders scattered across the Manawatū countryside, this is your kind of suffering. The 25% gravel ratio sounds friendly until you're dealing with punctures while chasing time cuts that historically claim a significant chunk of the field. Show up undertrained and you'll join the long list of DNFs who underestimated what 'toughest one-day race in Oceania' actually means.",
      "alternatives": "Dirty Kanza offers similar field-fracturing chaos but with more predictable Midwest conditions instead of New Zealand's weather roulette. If you want the mixed-surface challenge without the travel logistics nightmare, Crusher in the Tushar delivers comparable suffering with better infrastructure and fewer question marks about whether the race will actually happen.",
