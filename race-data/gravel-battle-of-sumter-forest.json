March timing avoids summer heat but creates visibility issues. Dust conditions were so severe that Marni \"could barely see anything\" on gravel sections, forcing her to slow down for safety. \"There was a crash on the gravel sometime in the first 10 miles but I think everyone that crashed there finished.\" More weather exposure than Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

5 15 in the morning and i'm\ngetting ready to drive to clemson south\ncarolina it's about an hour and a half\naway\nso right now we're making some bacon\nwe're cooking some oats and then we're\nalso going to poach some eggs\nmy parents have this kind of cool\ncontraption i'm staying at my parents\nhouse\nand they're out of town actually right\nnow and i had to watch the dogs\nand uh i guess the dogs like to sleep in\nthe bed\nwith my parents and my parents were gone\nso they're trying to sleep in the bed\nwith me these are two\n100 pound dogs uh dobermans\nand they were just loud and pushing me\nso i ended up\nretreating to the couch and uh yeah it\nwas\nit was brutal hard hard night sleep last\nnight\nanyways i'm gonna get some coffee get\nsome breakfast in and then\nyeah we're gonna go to this race\n[Applause]\nreally\nman getting ready in a van like this is\nuh\nis pretty tough makes you wish that you\nhad one of those sprinters\num but yeah let's uh\nlet's get ready to roll\nsunscreen is uh super important\nespecially with where i'm coming from\nwith\nall the snow i suppose they got like 16\ninches last night\nso uh yeah i'm glad to be here right now\nthat's for sure\nall right guys so this place is packed\ni mean it's absolutely insane\nit kind of gives you that sense of hope\nthat there's gonna be something\npost-covered we're all wearing masks\num and in our own little spaces um\nwhich is it's kind of different this is\nthe first race i've been back to since\ncovid and whatever else but uh\nbut yeah this is this is exciting um\nthis is really cool\nwe got the bike all diode we're gonna\nrun the gravel king\nuh pan eraser tires uh the slicks\n38 it's been pretty dry and we're gonna\nrun those tires at about\n50 to 50 in the front and then uh\n52 in the rear it's 50 gravel and then\n50 road so i just want a little extra\ntraction on the road sections because\nthat's probably my only chance\nwhat's going on guys so this is the\ninstagram video from the southeast\ngravel race i'm literally just doing a\nvoice memo of this blindly so i can\nexplain it to you\nbut obviously at the beginning of the\nrace one person goes up the road like\nwithin the first\ni'm talking about two miles like i\nremember seeing him go up and i was like\nif he can make it he can have it\nyes we keep riding group kind of is all\nover the road\nit's a pretty big mass start but this\nguy really does put a big dig\nfrom jamie carney's school piedmont\ncollege\nhe puts in a pretty solid hefty dig i\nthink he actually gets a pretty good gap\nand goes out of sight\nbut anyways we come into this first dirt\nsector here soon\nwell actually not yet but um\nlike i said yeah we're still kind of all\nover the road i think i went to the\nfront\nbecause i was getting a little sketched\nout you can kind of see me right there\ni'll try to circle me out here in a\nsecond but we were moving like we were\ngoing pretty quick\nall the way into the first dirt section\num it's about seven miles\nuntil you hit the first third section of\nthe race\nand um yeah it's uh\nit's pretty much it but he's he's been\noff the front for quite some time\num pretty cruisy uh it's kind of i think\nit's like kind of a slight downhill\nhonestly\nand that's why he's able to kind of keep\nthe speed so high\nbut yeah so we hit the first dirt\nsection here and this is actually where\nthings kind of start to go\nnuts um people kind of all over the\nplace\nand it's pretty hectic\num at this point we brought him back\nthey didn't get a video of it uh just\nbecause of how crazy it is\nbut uh now another guy goes up the road\nafter\nthe dirt section and um yeah he's off by\nhimself\num and this one is kind of where people\nstart to think like\nhe might actually stay away but he was\nalways within sight out on course\nuh lead motor right now this race is\ninsane i\nabsolutely cannot believe how little\ngroup is splitting up\num i know it's probably 80 people right\nnow\nwe do have one of our female riders\ncasey armstrong here\num we have one rider off the front right\nnow from automatic racing\nnot 100 sure who it is but we'll find it\nin a second here\nbut man these dudes they are dirty\nso i think this is coming out of the\nsecond dirt section\num he yeah\nhe's still off the front by himself um\nand i think i'm chasing here with josh\nwhitmore so we'll hear\nsee here in a second um\nyeah so it's me and josh whitmore and is\nhe's a\nfriend of mine and and a coach at cts\nand\nwe kind of just rolled off and we're\njust like let's keep it rolling\nand um so we kept rolling um\nrotating pretty steady through with each\nother\num but as you can tell the the group's\nnot that far behind and\nted king didn't make that split so i you\nknow i kept thinking to myself if i'm by\nmyself\nthere's it's only a matter of time\nbefore ted bridges up but this is one of\nthe dirt sections where it started to\nget nuts and this is like the only\ntechnical part of the gravel race\nitself it starts with a super fast\ndownhill\nand i want to say that i almost like\nsagged descended it\nso like i was at the front at this point\ni think we've caught everybody\nand i get all the way to like the back\nof the field\num which you know\nwas the only time that i checked out on\nthe course because the moment i checked\nout\nis that all right i am at the end of\nmonument road\nwhich is in my opinion the best part\nabout the course it's the most technical\nsection\ni pretty much forces the riders to stay\nsingle file all the way through\num we went into it with i don't know 60\nto 80 riders in a\ngroup so we're gonna see what it looks\nlike on the other end\nbut yeah as ben's saying i mean this is\nthis is getting pretty nuts\num and we come out of this gravel\nwith a pity pretty big group um i'm\nactually off the back and i have to\nchase back on\nsolo um it was like kind of like a false\nflat\nall the way up through this section but\nas you can tell just everybody's in\nshreds um coming out of that section and\nit wasn't like technical single track or\nanything it was just a little chunkier\nthan usual\num and yeah it split the group up pretty\nsolid so\nwe're kind of all over the place we're\nat rest stop two right now which is\nabout 55 miles in\num we still have a pretty large lead\ngroup of at least 25\ntim coffee was off the front with about\na 15 second gap and ted king was on the\nfront with a group absolutely strung out\nbringing it\nso we'll see what it looks like at rest\nstop too so this point i'm back\ni'm up the road that's me up the road um\ni am chasing there's one guy up the road\ntim coffey\num and this is the group that sticks we\nhave tim coffey off the front maybe\nabout a 10 second gap we have a chase\ngroup of three with matt musa john croom\nand one other and then we've got a group\nof about 20 to 25 right behind that so\nwe're at the river crossing right now\nthis is the group that goes um\nand it's a brutal one\nand so we come into this river section\nand this is the last real climb of the\nday\nplease excuse my non-handling through\nthis river section\ni even tim coffee looked at me and was\nlike dude what the hell was that\num yeah i got really scared that i was\ngonna crash on camera\nuh in the middle of this section and um\nthat wasn't a goal of mine but then we\ngo up this climb and this is kind of\nwhere i get dropped\nand now you can see the guys that are\nchasing pretty hard\nto catch back on\nas you can tell coming out of that out\nof that section i've been dropped\num i'm hurting and then this is what i\nnoticed that like ted king\num scott mcgill and andrew dillman\naren't far behind so i was just gonna\nlet him catch\nand then there's heath dodson so he\nprobably had the same same issue as me\nit was probably just a steep climb and\nit was pretty heavy\nbut uh we\nthe the three then becomes seven\nand yeah we just we pretty much just\nstart motoring and start rotating\nfor pretty much the whole rest of the\nrace\ni mean where we're moving\nand so we're we're coming back in on the\nhome stretch i'm pretty sure that this\nis the section that we\nhad did earlier in the race the first\ngravel section\num and so we're kind of hitting a slight\nuphill\num and at this point it's me matt musa\num\ni think it's bessette is his name\nhe just recently did like tandem para\nnationals and\nted king dilman and scott mcgill and\nthen there's three guys chasing so it's\nit's a milligan rider bobby and heath\ndawson who are chasing back on\ni remember um somebody turning around in\na group of seven and pretty much saying\nthey're about to catch they're about to\ncatch\nand i thought he meant the whole group\nand i was mind blown at that point\nbecause like i said we we had ridden at\nthat point with like 20 people\nso it was pretty insane to think that an\nentire group was about to catch us again\nafter how hard we were going\nso this is i think this is us coming out\nof the dirt like we're almost finished\nwith all the dirt sections\num right now i'm just kind of playing it\ncrafty and thinking\nyou know i needed food and bobby look\nhooked it up\nwith some food and um yeah that pretty\nmuch\nsaved my life i was pretty much cramping\nthe whole time at this point that's why\ni got dropped on the climb\nwe make the turn on the road and and\nthat was the last third section\nlike it's game on at this point we're\nall together\nrotating pretty pretty hard um\nand yeah i'm just trying to stretch it\nout the whole time\nride as super hard as i can um\nand i'm noticing that i'm not really\nshaking anyone um\ni knew that there was a big climb at the\nfinish and i know that i can't go uphill\nso\nif i could go uphill by myself i could\nprobably do okay\nbut if i have to bring this whole group\nit's not going to go well so\ni was trying my hardest to kind of shake\nas many people as i could and\njust didn't happen here's the second\ngroup\nthey're i want to say like 30 40 seconds\nbehind at this point i believe\nbut yeah so here's the last turn i\nbelieve going into the final straight\nand uh here's the finish at this point\nwe've like hit a single track\nwhere it's it's blown up it's all over\nthe place and there's scott mcgill\nskinny little guy\ngoes over the hill andrew dillman\nanother skinny little dude\njust smashes our faces and\nmilligan rider who bridged up awesome\nride for them and\nyeah they they fought super hard and\nand got across at this point i didn't\nhave the bike handling skills to get to\nthe single track\num and i kind of coasted with matt\nmoussa\nfor uh eighth place i believe\nwhich yeah to me was was a good ride i\ni was really stoked on it and uh happy\nto finish\nbut yeah that's the race analysis\nso i got no footage of the race i was\npretty much full time i think i got 10th\nor so\nbut yeah we came in as a came in as a\npretty big group\nand scott won\neverybody's in here it's actually on an\nactive gun range too so\nbut there in the finish was just like a\nlong long climb and\nit was steep so\nbroken saddle ted there it looks like he\nhad a rough one\nhow was it sweet\nminus the final yeah is that your saddle\nor your food or your\nbelly sugar guy saddle and saddle bag\nwell there you have it guys you kind of\ncame in as a group and that was a steep\none so i just hung on for dear life\noh my god\nso what do you think man i heard this is\nlike\ntwo or three times what it was last year\nno four times\nfour times yeah last year we had 200\npeople this was 400 um\ni mean this made my dreams come true we\nhad a 10-0\nfull-on sprint into the finish um that's\nmy kind of race\nyou think this is the new biggest race\non the southeast i think it is i mean\nhonestly the the competition for an\noff-road race in the southeast the whole\ntime i don't know when the last time\nthis amount of competition has been in a\nrace i mean road racing yes but\nlike holy cow yeah that was wild well\nguys there you have it that's ben\nthe runner of the southeast gravel\nseries one of the founders\nand uh yeah i mean the start list was\ninsane\nall right here we go so\nwe did 350 for an hour\n441 for five\nman what an epic event that was\nit was super hard race um\ni was cramping on and off i was probably\nriding way too hard\nstrong and stupid is what somebody would\nlike to call it but uh\nbut yeah i i felt pretty content with my\nposition\nand how i finished i finished um like\neighth\nor ninth place and uh\nyeah i wasn't even really expecting it\nbeing in the front group so to be able\nto finish that is great\nbut uh now we'll drive home and get\nready for a track session tomorrow",

          "transcript": "[Music]\nand then\nwhat makes gravel racing so cool is it's\nvery unpredictable and in one word it's\nwild\n21 right\ngood morning\nwell gravel is so cool because first off\nit's like a mast art there's so many\npeople\nit's men it's women it's you've got pro\nracers you've got people that it's their\nfirst time they've ever raced a bike\nit's\njust this community of everyone can do\ngravel racing and then at the end of it\nthere's this big like we all come\ntogether there's a party um it's a lot\nof fun and i really like the gravel\ncommunity because it's just it's very\nuplifting and everyone's really friendly\nand\nyeah it's there's a place for everyone\nhere\nlack of cars you're out\nin nature you meet a lot of awesome\npeople something you can do\ngenerationally\nmy daughters ride my granddaughter rides\nand it's just really cool\nthe main thing is because it takes you\naway from the hustle and bustle of the\nworld\nso you own these these private roads i'm\nnot private but\nno cars on the road so y'all here just\nwith the with the wilderness you know\nwhat we get to ride near lakes rivers\ncross rivers under bridges we on these\nroads where there's no cause no hassle\nno danger only danger is us trying to\nbeat each other\nmountain bikers and road road riders are\nthey're both coming to gravel because\nit's kind of a mix of the two what i\nlike about gravel is you know\nif you if you talk to cyclists who've\ndone road races and mountain bike races\nthey kind of say uh you know the vibe at\na road race it's very\nyou know\npeople are so type a and they don't want\nto talk and it's all serious um i feel\nlike it retains the vibe that you get at\nan endurance mountain bike race where\npeople are just\nhanging out after the race and they're\ntalking about how the race went and\nbecause it's i most gravel races are a\nmass start\neverybody gets the feeling that we're\nall in this together\nwell you need to think about this gravel\nracing which is my first time attempting\nthis\nuh is\nis that\nthe the number of people participating\non the same course in the same road\nmakes it not only challenging but\nthere's a form of camaraderie\nthat you seem to experience with other\nwriters\nother writers looking at a person that's\ndisabled\nyou seem to inspire them i get inspired\nseeing them because i i'm challenging\nmyself to keep up or pass them\nwell it's a time where you can go out\nwith by yourself or your buddies and you\ncan either\nlike do the best you want to and like\nreally focus on getting your result or\nyou can just ride it it's it's fun for\neveryone in terms of cycling\n[Laughter]\nsoutheast gravel i mean it really\nstarted probably back in the mid 2000s i\nwas training i was racing full-time on\nthe road and i signed up for a uci pro\nrace in upstate new york called the\nbaton kill classic\nand so that was on a lot of dirt road\nthere had never been an event like that\nbefore it was on the uci calendar and\neverybody was using their road bikes\nand so i started training my road bike\non a lot of these dirt roads and going\nout and just it was a lot of fun you\nknow there was no traffic out there just\ngetting flats all the time i was on 23\nmillimeter tires\nand so i just fell in love with riding\non more of the dirt roads going into the\nunknown places where it's not the\ntypical route and so i was going out and\nplotted a course in clinton south\ncarolina area it was an 80 mile route\nand i finished it\nuploaded it to strava and there wasn't a\nsingle straw segment on the course\nso i made a face a facebook post and i\njust said hey i just did this cool ride\nwho would be interested in doing an\nevent out there and like 200 people\ncommented on the post and said that they\nwould come out\nand uh so i said all right let's quickly\nmake an event uh\ndid the registration on bike reg and we\nhad our first southeast gravel event in\n2018 and it was great we had just over\n200 people show up\nboyd is the reason south southeast growl\ncame to be actually so the first year of\nsoutheast gravel uh 2019 i was still\nracing full-time um boyd had not been\nracing for a while\nand so you know brought the team out and\nactually the very first event um wasn't\nquite as big but you know the team\nmyself included we got first second and\nthird and after the race boyd's like\ndude i didn't realize this many people\nare going to show up i think i'm going\nto need your help do you want to help me\nput some races on i said absolutely\num and i don't know if boyd is involved\nwith this but later on that season i\ncame down with a heart condition and i\nhad to quit riding for about a year and\na half so it was perfect it would let me\nfocus you know fully on southeast gravel\num now we have six events and that's\nthat's really how southeast gravel\nstarted um\nboyd and i run it together now he's um\nhe's kind of our route master our timing\nmaster\nand i help with sponsorship stuff\nputting together volunteers for the\nevents rest stops\nand we both\nhelp with everything in between there\nthe gravel battle of sumter forest i\nthink it's i think it's safe to say it's\na crowd favorite um it's definitely this\nis what i tell everybody it's our\neasiest course meaning\nit has the least amount of climbing um\nand probably the least amount of\ntechnical features that being said it's\nstill a really fun course the reason i\nlike our clinton course so much is it's\na very dynamic race um when we're at the\nfront of the race we've got you know our\nracers racing it uh the the group tends\nto stick together a lot more just\nbecause there aren't any really hard\nclimbs there aren't any really hard\ntechnical features like single track um\nso we end up seeing more of an actual\nroad race versus um a truly brutal\ngravel event where it's just who can\nride the hardest for four hours\num really fast long straightaways\nrelatively smooth gravel it's the type\nof course where we're always going to\nget a rider who says i think i can do\nthis on a road bike\nit almost works until it doesn't\n26 and 27 45 in the front 48 in the back\nyeah 25 in both i ran 50 i probably\nshould have done 45s um just a little\nover 30. so like 32\nuh i've got 25 and 27 in the rear uh i\ngot the uh 32 in the front 35 in the\nback 38c tires i'm running 37.35\ni did\n45.35 so 45 in the back and 35 in the\nfront\ntire pressure is so important because\nthere's so many mixed surfaces\nthroughout the race so it's really\nimportant to pick a pressure that you\ncan ride you know over rough gravel but\nalso you know not get a flat and then\nalso\nworks well on the road as well so it's\nreally you know it's good to look at the\ncourse ahead of time and really figure\nout\nwhat the course is going to be like so\nyou can decide what tire pressure you\nreally want to run\nyou know it's always a struggle knowing\nwhat kind of pressure it got\nin your tire i did i did 26 28.\nthat's a very good question because\nbeing that this is only my second gravel\nrace the first time i did it and\neveryone's gonna laugh so here's your\nlaugh it was at 60 psi which was way up\nthere so the first race was really bumpy\nthis time my teammates who've been\ngravel racing for a long time they\nadjusted the pressure to about 49\nuh 50 or so for this race so\nwren\nfront 35 rear 38 uh in 38c tires\nyeah no flats last year i flatted twice\nuh one early on second in the river\ncrossing and so this year was pretty\ngood survived today i ran\nabout 40 40 no 38 i took it under 40.\nand it worked really good for me that's\none of my biggest things i've been\nhaving an issue with is trying to find\nthe right tire pressure and\naround\n35 to 40 been good for me so today was\ncloser to 40 and it was smooth smooth\nsmooth riding today\ni'm andy scarano from athens georgia\ntook the dub\nby michael i had pretty good legs and\nfitness coming into it and i saw the\nheat on the start list and\nit's like all right i got to play my\ncards right and just had to\nkeep myself at the front which was uh\npretty tough at the beginning you know\nthese big mass starts are pretty hectic\nso it's\nkind of have to play on your instincts\nand and\nkind of play like a crit where it's like\nreally aggressive and you just gotta\nhold your own and be up there and mark\nthe guys you know are good and fast and\njust stay on their wheel\nthis is probably the flattest course of\nthe series which means that speeds are\nhigh and there's not a lot of\nopportunity to try to get away\num\nknowing my strengths i know that i'm not\na great sprinter so\ni was trying to\neither solo or get the get that final\ngroup as small as it could possibly be\nbecause the less people that i have to\ncontend with for the sprint finish the\nbetter\nso we roll out and we're on this road\nsection there were a couple guys trying\nto make moves happen and you know me\nincluded i was i was trying to see if we\ncould do some sort of early break\npeople's legs were just too fresh\neverything was getting chased down um\nand that's honestly that's kind of how\nit was for most of the day there was\nreally not much that was sticking\nuh\ni would say that probably for the first\nhour hour and a half i was trying to\nmake moves happen here or there and\nthere were other guys too that were\ntrying to make moves happen but\nyou know the most the most somebody\nwould get is maybe\n30 seconds before we we started reeling\nthem in again i mean i i don't think\nanyone even ever got out of sight after\nabout an hour and a half i i was just\nkind of like\ni need to save my energy for a spot\nwhere i can really make it count\nand knowing this course\nthat spot to me was was the hill right\nafter the creek crossing which is really\ni think the longest climb of the race\nit's it's still not super long but it's\nprobably the longest climb of the race\ni was thinking if i if i can just go as\nhard as i can up that climb\nyou know maybe i can get this group\nsmaller so\nyeah yeah so it was uh we had a pretty\nbig group up until about\nthe creek crossing so that was maybe 30k\nto go summit attacked through the creek\ncrossing seven of us\nray started out was really fast but\nnothing really got away and then where\nstuff really happened was after the\ncreek crossing um dylan johnson really\nhit it up the first um first steep climb\nand i was the last one that hung on to\nthat i think i went through the creek\nthird wheel and\nand then led up that climb and by the\ntime we got to that climb the group had\nbeen whittled down to\nprobably five or six riders\nover the course of the next 15 miles\nbefore we got to the finish um the group\ngot further reduced to four riders but\nthen on the descent my chain came off\nand i had to get get off and put it back\non but i was able to tack on to the next\ngroup on the road and uh come in for six\nthere's a crash and then just dwindle\ndown let's have four of us and then it\njust\ncat and mouse at the end\ni didn't see or hear the crash happen i\njust i didn't hear that he crashed until\nafter the race there's four riders\ncoming into the finish um i knew it was\ngoing to be a sprint i knew it was going\nto be a steep uphill sprint i kind of\npositioned myself second wheel which i\nthought was a good position the rider\nwho won his sprint was\nso strong i mean he probably had four\nbike lengths on us\nand uh\nthird place out of a four-person\nsprint finish\nnice job dude\nnice\nwhat did you think of that finish\nthat was tough i wasn't expecting that\nsteep hill did you did you pre-ride\nbefore i did not you did not oh my god\nyeah i just bought the little uh\nmarker on my on my map right you're like\n200 meters to go 10 grade\nthat was the the perfect move with just\nsending it into that final corner yeah\nit was like i can't get on his\nwheels you saw the little one\nit's close i can't see the wall yeah i i\nit was like whole so i can't go on the\nnice job guys\num my race so i was with\nthe group of women there was like four\nof us for most of the race um two of my\nteammates and then a girl who ended up\nfinishing second\num and it was pretty pretty hard we had\na pretty good group\ngoing throughout most the race and then\nthere was a little river crossing around\nmile 55 and then a very steep climb\nafter that so i got separated from the\ngirls who ended up finishing first and\nsecond so honestly after like the first\n10 minutes i felt really bad i just came\noff of a big race from arizona and i'm\nsupposed to be resting so i feel i felt\nreally tired today i wanted to sleep in\nso bad\nso after the first 10 minutes i started\nto fall back and honestly i just wanted\nto quit\num but i gave myself five minutes to\njust rest and start to start getting\nback into it and uh i started feeling\nbetter so that was\noh it was a really fun and hard race\nlike we start um\nlike the first part of the race i'm\nstaying with the front team the front\ngroup and then\num in one hill i back and then\nso i'm steady with a leader group i\nfound a group to kind of hang with and\nthen we work together to get to the\nfinish and for the final part we only\ntwo womans in the in the group and we\njust printed hotel in the last climb we\nwere like it was so funny and so hard\nyeah just hold on for third and\ni mean that's that's gravel racing is\njust hold on for your life\nfrom the very beginning i started off i\nbroke a chain\nand i had it and fortunately some other\nriders were extremely generous they\nbroke out their tools and we were able\nto fix my bike in just a few minutes\nuh just the the level of the people that\nare here\nin this program is just and their\ngenerosity is overwhelmingly appreciated\nit's a great experience and a lot of fun\nto be have the privilege of\nparticipating as a adaptive sports rider\nwith all the other people i was so\nfocused on staying focused and doing you\nknow\nthe best i could without crashing i was\nalways worried about crashing at the\nbeginning i've only had two races before\nthis is my first time doing this course\ni felt pretty good uh i rode well i was\nat almost a mile an hour faster than i\nwas last year\nso i felt good i was in a good group for\nmost of the ride at about\n55 miles there was a little bit of a\nwreck in front of me so i lost i got\nbridged uh to the group i was in and\njust couldn't couldn't get back on a\nroad solo probably the last\n15 miles i couldn't i couldn't close it\nso i probably lost eight nine minutes\nthere great time so i saw a youtube\nvideo about last year and i said hey\nthat looks fun so i bought a bike at the\nend of the year and\nit's my first ride signed up for this\none man i had a blast\ntoday's day was intense really intense\nriding with the front pack hanging out\nwith the pros and then settling into my\nown just keeping up with with my pace\nyou know i had my intentions today was\nto do better than i did last year and i\nbeat my time by like 10 minutes so i'm\ni'm thoroughly impressed with what i did\ntoday my first gravel event last year my\nfirst time riding gravel was here at the\nbattle of stumbling i did it again i'm a\nsophomore gravel racing so here we go\ni just want to get out of the tundra\nland for a little bit and i'm on a\nbucket list goal of a 50-mile race in\nall 50 states\nand i got 24 races in so far in 17\nstates\ni've not completed this whole loop i've\ndone the practice and so complete the\nwhole loop i'd like to do it in three\nhours\ni i'm trying to finish actually that's\nmy goal today is to finish and\nuh you know finishing maybe under five\nhours my main goals were to stay on two\nwheels\nuh get through this first round without\nhitting the deck in top ten which i\nthink i may have done all of three so\npretty\nwhen you have a turnout this big you\nknow over 400 riders coming to this race\nit's really just something you can't\npass up and throwing a little\ncompetition into it never hurts\nsoutheast gravel does an amazing job of\norganizing the events picking out great\ngreat courses\nand it's just they're just run really\nreally well i do probably 20 to 25\naround the country all the bwrs\nmid-south\nsbt and this is run honestly as good as\nany of them\nyou",

Riders describe the course as having chunky, blown-out sections especially before the I-26 underpass, while other gravel portions are smoother. Even the pavement sections are notably rough, making gravel bikes essential. The first major challenge comes at mile 7 with the first dirt section where the large mass start creates hectic conditions and the field begins splitting up. Early race pace is fast with attacks starting within the first two miles. The course features quiet back roads with minimal car traffic, crossing under I-26 twice and including sections on the Palmetto Trail. Riders recommend 38mm slick tires around 50-52 PSI for the mixed surface conditions. The race atmosphere is described as packed and exciting, representing a return to racing post-pandemic with strong community spirit typical of gravel events."
