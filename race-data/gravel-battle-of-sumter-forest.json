Karel's experienced group averaged 23.9mph for the first 6-mile gravel section, then maintained 21.5mph for the next 50 miles with heart rate \"in the mid 160's.\" The course format of \"a few miles of gravel and then a few miles of road - rinse and repeat for 72 miles\" prevents monotony."

        "explanation": "Mixed terrain creates constant handling challenges beyond pure fitness. The course includes \"a river crossing, a few steep hills and a tight rocky turn\" plus I-26 tunnels that both long and short courses navigate. Marni describes \"loose gravel\" and \"hillier sections with holes, sand and rocks to dodge\" requiring sustained attention."

        "explanation": "Course delivers memorable features beyond typical gravel grinding. \"One of the most iconic shots of the Sumter Forest course is the tunnels that traverse under I-26,\" now featured on both distances. The bidirectional river crossing and finish \"through a corn field, onto gravel and then a pitchy climb\" through a former active shooting range create distinct moments."

Road hazards like crater-sized holes catch riders by surprise at speed, while dust conditions force visibility compromises. Aid stations at miles 21, 40, and 63 provide \"pickle juice, coke, and lot's of other fun snacks\" supporting the 400-rider field."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Fast-paced competition creates road race intensity on mixed terrain. Karel notes that \"because of Karel's bike racing experience, this gravel race felt much like a road race for him.\" The start was \"fast, a bit chaotic as everyone got organized into a tight pack\" with pace increasing rather than decreasing when hitting gravel sections."
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Nearly 400 registered riders created substantial pandemic-era energy with strong organizer reputation. \"Ben and Boyd of Southeast gravel are just plain awesome so their presence alone brings along good people who love bikes,\" notes Marni. \"Whitmire was super excited to bring bike racing to their downtown area\" with Main Street finish line and free primitive camping available."
      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Regional competitive depth evident in sprint finishes without elite national draw. Karel cramped near the end but still managed 3rd in his age group, missing first \"by just a few seconds\" in the final sprint. Equal pay structure brought stronger women's field, though free water bottles for first 200 registrants suggests modest elite expectations."

Post-race includes \"a hot meal and a cold refreshing beer\" with downtown Whitmire exploration opportunities."
