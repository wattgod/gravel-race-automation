        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Starting at 2,564 meters (8,412 feet) in Chía makes this a serious high-altitude challenge that separates sea-level athletes immediately. The thin air creates a physiological hurdle most gravel races can't match, defining the entire race experience."

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Part of the expanded 47-event UCI Gravel World Series offering Worlds qualification to top 25% finishers in each age group. Being among 16 new events added for South American growth is notable regionally, but it's a debut race with no competitive history."

      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Racing gravel in the shadow of Peña de Juaica near historic Chía combines high-altitude challenge with cultural immersion. The setting blends pre-Columbian ceremonial sites with colonial architecture, creating a backdrop few gravel events can match."
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Part of South American gravel expansion with the same organizers running events across the continent, building a regional network. UCI qualification format brings international riders to mix with Colombian gravel scene in an emerging market."
      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Worlds qualification potential attracts serious competitors, but South American gravel fields typically run smaller than European or US events. The 2,564-meter starting elevation will limit international participation from sea-level-based athletes."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "UCI Worlds qualification opportunity combined with access to unique Colombian highland terrain offers solid value proposition. No entry fees announced, but South American events typically price below European UCI races while delivering distinctive experiences."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "International flights to El Dorado Airport plus lodging near Chía with no logistical guidance creates expensive travel requirements.
