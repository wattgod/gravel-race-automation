        "score": 4,

      "race_quality": {
        "score": 4,

        "score": 5,

      "community": {
        "score": 4,

The Gran Fondo foundation means there's already a passionate local scene that knows how to celebrate suffering."

        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Elite category at 111km draws World Championship qualification seekers, but international depth is still building. Being the only official Brazilian gravel race draws local talent. The real killers might still be figuring out this race exists. Similar competitive depth to Rule of Three."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 5,
        "explanation": "First gravel race in Southern America for unknown entry fees offers historical access at presumably reasonable Brazilian pricing. You're getting World Championship qualifying opportunity without European price tags. The experience-to-cost ratio tilts heavily toward riders."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Registration runs R$400. Getting to Balneário Camboriú means international flights for most riders, then domestic connections through Brazil's airport system. March timing avoids peak tourist season pricing. The real cost is in travel logistics, not local expenses. Similar expense level to Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."
