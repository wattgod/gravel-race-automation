        "explanation": "6,562 feet in 62 miles delivers over 100 feet of climbing per mile. The triple crankset setup with 50-39-30 and 11-40 cassette that local riders run suggests sustained climbing that demands very easy gearing options. More climbing than SBT GRVL at the same score."

      "climate": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "March 8th puts you in Brazilian autumn—theoretically cooler than summer madness but still tropical humidity. Santa Catarina's coast means unpredictable weather patterns and potential for everything from blazing sun to sudden storms. Similar climate challenges to SBT GRVL."

      "prestige": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "First UCI Gravel race in Southern America carries serious weight—you're making history just by showing up. World Championship qualifier status puts it on the global radar, backed by the same crew running UCI Gran Fondo Brazil for years."

      "race_quality": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "UCI sanctioning means organization standards backed by the team behind Gran Fondo Brazil. They've been running serious cycling events annually for years. Still early to call it flawless without more rider feedback from multiple editions."

        "score": 5,
        "explanation": "You're pioneering gravel racing in Brazil—that's bucket list territory. Balneário Camboriú puts you in Santa Catarina's playground where mountains meet coast. The combination of being first to the party and racing unexplored gravel territory makes this unforgettable."

      "community": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Brazilian cycling culture runs deep, with riders enthusiastic about sharing their builds for tropical conditions. Local framebuilding scene exists to support gravel riding. The Gran Fondo foundation means there's already a passionate local scene that knows how to celebrate suffering."

      "field_depth": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Elite category at 111km draws World Championship qualification seekers, but international depth is still building. Being the only official Brazilian gravel race draws local talent. The real killers might still be figuring out this race exists. Similar competitive depth to Rule of Three."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 5,
        "explanation": "First gravel race in Southern America for unknown entry fees offers historical access at presumably reasonable Brazilian pricing. You're getting World Championship qualifying opportunity without European price tags. The experience-to-cost ratio tilts heavily toward riders."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Registration runs R$400. Getting to Balneário Camboriú means international flights for most riders, then domestic connections through Brazil's airport system. March timing avoids peak tourist season pricing. The real cost is in travel logistics, not local expenses. Similar expense level to Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."
