        "score": 4,

      "value": {
        "score": 5,
        "explanation": "First gravel race in Southern America for unknown entry fees offers historical access at presumably reasonable Brazilian pricing. You're getting World Championship qualifying opportunity without European price tags. The experience-to-cost ratio tilts heavily toward riders."

      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Getting to Balneário Camboriú means international flights for most riders, then domestic connections through Brazil's airport system. March timing avoids peak tourist season pricing. The real cost is in travel logistics, not local expenses."

      "should_you_race": "If you need UCI points or want to say you raced Brazil's inaugural gravel event, this makes sense. The 6,562 feet of climbing over 62 miles suggests sustained suffering, not punchy attacks. Show up ready for humidity, unknown surfaces, and the chaos that comes with first-year events where nothing goes according to plan.",
