The inaugural 2025 edition faced 'extreme weather conditions' that forced stage neutralization, showing how African storms can disrupt even well-organized events. While the full-service Burn Camps handle tent setup and meals, you're still managing customs, gear transport, and multi-timezone coordination to reach the Great Karoo. As Evening Activities puts it: \"Riders would gather around campfires, sharing stories of the day's challenges while mechanics worked on their bikes and support staff handled the washing.\""

Race organizers note that 'completing the race requires endurance, experience, and preparation – qualities that are within reach of a moderately fit cyclist' with 12+ hours weekly training over six months. The cumulative fatigue matters more than individual stage distances. Similar distance to Crusher in the Tushar."

        "explanation": "Described as 'relatively smooth, non-technical gravel roads' but terrain varies from 'wide, open Champagne Gravel to remote and narrow paths.' The route demands bike handling skills across coastal forests, Karoo semi-desert plains, and African bushveld. Andri Frischknecht's crash during a neutralized section shows that even non-technical terrain poses handling challenges in exposed conditions. Similar technical demands to Gravel Worlds. As Stage 3 puts it: \"A mix of technical climbing, descending, and fast gravel\""

The route traverses 'rugged passes and breathtaking vistas' from Knysna's rolling coastal hills through the Great Karoo's expansive plains to Shamwari's African bushveld terrain. Seven days of accumulated climbing through these geological transitions will break plenty of riders by the final stages. More climbing than SBT GRVL at the same score.

        "explanation": "The inaugural 2025 race experienced 'extreme weather conditions' and significant storms that forced stage neutralization. October brings temperature swings from 95°F daytime highs in the Great Karoo to sharp drops after sunset. Lateral wind gusts proved dangerous enough to cause serious crashes even during neutralized racing, highlighting the climate challenges of this arid semi-desert crossing. More weather exposure than Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego. As Night before Stage 6 puts it: \"A storm came in during the evening with strong, gale-force winds blowing down the nearby bergs into our campsite in Merino Farm at 1,300m above sea level.\""

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Starting near sea level in Knysna and traversing Eastern Cape highlands means most elevation comes from climbing rather than sustained altitude stress. The route through Great Karoo and African bushveld likely stays below serious oxygen debt thresholds for most riders. Temperature and terrain pose greater physiological challenges than altitude in these South African highlands. Modest altitude compared to Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

You're literally crossing geological and ecological zones most humans never experience, let alone on a bike. The inaugural status means you're writing the first chapter of this race's story in some of Africa's most remote terrain."

The routing from Knysna forests through the Great Karoo to Shamwari Game Reserve is masterfully planned – each stage builds the narrative. Stage breakdowns like the 7km Tarka Botha climb followed by steep descents prove they understand how to design suffering with purpose.

          "transcript": "[Music]\nThe Netbank gravel burn is an immersive\ncycling experience through the Great\nKore and it's really a 24-hour\nexperience. Riders will experience such\ndiversity. Start in the coastal areas of\nNisner going into the wide open expanse\nof the Great Korea and then finishing in\nthe bushfelt of Shamari.\nThe morning starts slowly with you\nstepping out of your tent and taking\nyour camp chair to sit next to the\ncampfire. Enjoy a morning coffee and a\nrusk wholesome breakfast before you get\nonto your bike to start what might be\none of the most exhilarating bike rides\nyou've done in your\nlife. Riders will stay in an intimate\ncamping experience where their tents are\nsurrounding the campfire. They never\nhave to walk too far to enjoy facilities\nthat you'd want in a burn\ncamp. Each lap has got its own camp\nmaster and host that look after the\nriders. They'll be lighting the fires at\nsunrise and at sunset and just taking\ncare of the rers's needs. We made a big\neffort to make the life in the camp as\ncomfortable as possible and of course\nit's important to have a good night's\nsleep. Tents are very comfortable. I can\nstand upright in it. We've got a off\nground cot and it makes for a very\ncomfortable sleeping experience. which\nis obviously important if you've got to\ntake on a very big ride the next day.\nWhen you get to the finish line, there's\ncold cloth to wipe yourself down, have a\nbeer, enjoy the sunset. We've designed\nsustainable solutions for our toilets\nand showers, appropriate for the great\ncrew.\nEnjoy a hearty dinner from, you know,\nthe local community that preparing the\ndinner and enjoy the night sky. You sit\naround the campfire in the evening, have\na glass of wine, beers, all on tap, all\ncomplimentary from the NetBank Rebel\nBurn and our partners. Have a wonderful\nnight's sleep out in the open in the\ngreat crew.",

          "transcript": "So, if you'd have watched my last video,\nyou would have seen me show an overview\nof everything about the Gravel Band, the\nlongest gravel stage race in the world\nthat takes place in the South African\nbush.\nHowever, it was exactly that, an\noverview. I didn't get to show you\nexactly how each day played out in the\nKaru Desert. So, that's what this video\nis.\n&gt;&gt; Hope you enjoy.\n&gt;&gt; So, good morning. Welcome back to the\nvlog. It is stage four of the gravel\nburn. 5:45 alarm this morning was pretty\nrude as you can probably tell by my\nface, but it is a stunning morning.\nLet's go and have some breakfast.\n&gt;&gt; It's early, Adam.\n&gt;&gt; It's early.\n&gt;&gt; You don't look as cheerful as I feel.\n&gt;&gt; It's very early. How are we feeling?\n&gt;&gt; Feeling good.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n&gt;&gt; it's beautiful out here.\n&gt;&gt; It's beautiful.\n&gt;&gt; Lovely sunset. Lovely sunrise. And the\npiper has begun to cheer you up.\n&gt;&gt; That's to wake everyone up. If they're\nnot up already,\n&gt;&gt; they will be up.\n&gt;&gt; When that guy walks past your tent,\n[music]\nup. Good luck. Keep playing. We can say\nnow\n[music] we shake.\n&gt;&gt; Virginia's making a cameo.\n&gt;&gt; How do you feel about today, Virginia?\n&gt;&gt; I don't know. I mean, I'm happy to ride.\nI just don't want to\n&gt;&gt; race. [laughter]\n&gt;&gt; Okay, that's fine.\n&gt;&gt; It's going to be fun. And you think it's\ngoing to be beautiful.\n&gt;&gt; I don't know. They say it's a bit more\ntechnical, so maybe\n&gt;&gt; maybe it'll be more fun.\n&gt;&gt; More fun. Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; There you go. Well, good luck.\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\n&gt;&gt; The awesome guys at Sturker had shipped\nme a stupid amount of carbs to ensure\nthat I was fueled for every stage. So, a\nmassive shout out to Vivo Vita Sport,\nthe South African distributor of Sturka,\nalongside some other great brands for\nhelping me out. So, today we have 109\nkm, so probably close enough to 4 hours\non the bike. So, I've got 2 * 90 g in\neach bottle, 180 in carb, and then I\nthink five gels. So, another 250 g.\nHoping to hit that magical 100 g an\nhour. If you guys were looking to do a\nnutrition order, my Sturka affiliate\nlink is down below in the description if\nyou want to check it out.\n&gt;&gt; Let me get\n&gt;&gt; stage four.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; How are we feeling? I'm tired and\ncongested from the dust [laughter] and\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. But ready.\n&gt;&gt; What do we think about the outback\ntoday? The big loop.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. Um I think it will be\na lot more crazy than yesterday.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, you got the big tires on?\n&gt;&gt; I got the big tires.\n&gt;&gt; Show us which tires you've got.\n&gt;&gt; We got the monster truck tires. 2.2\nmountain bike tires.\n&gt;&gt; Wow. 2.2.\n&gt;&gt; You think they're going to be enough?\n&gt;&gt; I guess we'll find out.\nToday's stage was a big loop. So, for\nthe first and last time this race, we\nwould come back and finish at the same\ncamp that we started in, which is nice\nbecause we didn't have to worry about\npacking up all of our bags in the\nmorning.\nWell, hopefully you can hear me. It's\npretty windy. 109 km, 1,600, I think,\nmeters of climbing and uh some technical\nsections. It's going to be it's going to\nbe a tough one today. Naturally, I think\nnow having raced about 300 kilometers,\nthe legs are really starting to uh\neveryone's legs are starting to feel\npretty heavy and slow.\n&gt;&gt; [music]\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\nHeat.\n&gt;&gt; Heat. [music] Heat.\n&gt;&gt; Heat. Heat.\nHeat. Heat.\nI think your ears flopping in the wind.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. [laughter]\nWell, as you can probably tell by the\nlook on my face, we're done for the day.\nThat was hard. Good fun out there, but\ndefinitely glad to be back. It was\nreally quite hot, actually. Really glad\nI remembered the sunscreen. But yeah,\nbrutal. I'm cooked.\nReally, really fast. really really fast.\nI know it was good.\n&gt;&gt; Oh, Lawrence, you went easy today.\n&gt;&gt; So, most important thing when you are\nracing a stage race is to keep on top of\nnutrition and fuel. And luckily, these\nguys are ready to go with the whole tent\nwith lunch. Look at this.\n[laughter]\n&gt;&gt; It's good. [music]\nYeah,\n&gt;&gt; real highlight of the stage being that\nmy Azos teammate Maliza Rowings won the\nstage in dramatic fashion. So now I've\nhad some food and some liquid. I'm going\nto drop my bike off. Every day these\nguys are amazing. They have a whole\nworkshop set up. I'm luckily booked in\nfor one of the service packages. So\nevery day I give my bike to the\nmechanics. They clean it and then make\nsure that it is good to go for the next\nday. Check the sealant. Check the\nbearings. Do a once over. Relube it.\n&gt;&gt; How was it?\n&gt;&gt; Look, I have no front brake. [laughter]\n&gt;&gt; That was something. Yeah, that was\nsomething. I liked it day better.\n&gt;&gt; The headwing got to you?\n&gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. I was by myself so long. It\nwas\n&gt;&gt; And it's hot.\n&gt;&gt; You should get in the shade, Sarah.\nDon't burn.\n&gt;&gt; I'm going to go steal a salt shaker and\njust drink it. I'm like so salt\n[laughter] depleted. My legs are\ncramping all day. I'm just going to\ndrink it straight.\n&gt;&gt; You should. You should. Your helmet's\nalmost turned white. It's got so much\nsalt.\n&gt;&gt; Oh, really? That's where it is.\nme.\n&gt;&gt; It was really scary.\n&gt;&gt; It was like a very sort of desert\nBelgium,\n&gt;&gt; right?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. There was lots of people that did\nnot want to see the wind and there were\na very few that\n&gt;&gt; very filled pulling tones\n&gt;&gt; anything.\n&gt;&gt; Um. All right.\n&gt;&gt; Oh, sparkling gooseberry spicy water. M\n&gt;&gt; are we comparing TSS between the men's\nand the women's race?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. Here we go. TSS 226. Ah,\n&gt;&gt; almost the same.\n&gt;&gt; Oh, we literally got the same.\n&gt;&gt; Almost the same.\n&gt;&gt; Normalized. I was 189. You were 268.\n&gt;&gt; Ouch.\n&gt;&gt; Ouchie. [laughter] You did uh 500 more\nkjs.\n&gt;&gt; Woo.\n&gt;&gt; It was good. I really enjoy my stage.\nLet's go.\nWell, it was really fast all on the road\nmost of the time down some technical\nparts and then I stopped before the last\nclimb. I took it easy. Like I got some\nwater and then I was feeling good. So I\nstart brushing and I get back a little\nbit.\n&gt;&gt; Well done.\n&gt;&gt; Good day out. Anyway, back to the tent\nnow. I'm going to have a shower cuz I\nstink.\n&gt;&gt; Tell me about stage four, Melissa.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, stage four was uh pretty good.\n[laughter] Um I won. Amazing.\n&gt;&gt; It was a pretty ripping tailwind for the\nlast like 30k and I knew that it was\nalso a descent for the last 6k and so I\nattacked over the final climb into the\ndescent and had a little gap and held it\nto the finish line.\n&gt;&gt; And so what's the plan for the rest of\nthe race? You're sitting second on GC.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. A minute down.\n&gt;&gt; You're hoping to hold that position or\nyou hoping to get on top step or what's\nthe what's the plan?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I just have to see how um the legs\nshow up tomorrow. Yeah.\nSo, a whole week camping in these tents.\nI thought it would be rude not to give\nyou a little tour of exactly where we're\nsleeping for seven nights.\n&gt;&gt; Eight nights.\n&gt;&gt; Eight nights. Correct. So, follow me.\nSo, we have the bed set up every single\nday. Pretty nice. It's a raised bed.\nThey don't need to pump it up. And this\nhas a bit of a mattress on here. We had\nto bring the sleeping bag. So, we have a\nfull bed equipment set up and I also\nbrought a bl pill pillow because got to\nkeep the neck support. Um, they also\nhave little chair and of course the\nbedside table. And on the bedside table,\nthey also have a lamp which doubled as a\ncharging bank. So, they've thought of\neverything for us. As you can see, it's\na decent amount of space. Some people,\nbut as you can see, it's a nice amount\nof space. Some people are taking the\nbike inside and sleeping with the bike\nfor peace of mind. Uh, as you can see, I\ncan pretty much stand upright in here\nalmost. And, uh, yeah, the tents have\nbeen pretty cold each night. It's been\nWe're in the desert here, so the\ntemperature really goes out. So, uh, I\nthink most nights I slept in a hoodie\nand even a jumper some nights. Most\nnights I even slept in a jumper and also\na jacket. So, that was interesting. But\nthis is what a 5'7 person looks like in\nthis tent. [laughter]\n&gt;&gt; You hardly fill up anything, mate.\n&gt;&gt; No, you fit like 10 of me in there.\n&gt;&gt; Let's hear for the one, two, three from\nstage four. [applause]\n&gt;&gt; It's that time again, Justin.\n&gt;&gt; It's that time again.\n&gt;&gt; It's dinner time. I've just spent the\nlast hour editing some of the footage I\ngot from the Insta 360 today.\n&gt;&gt; Hell yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Some good shots from the action out\nthere. And uh yeah, now excited to eat\nsome food because I'm starving. Are you\nhungry?\n&gt;&gt; Uh yeah, basically.\nWell, hopefully you enjoyed this video.\nAnd if you want to see more, well, I\nmade a whole piece on my [music]\nexperience at the inaugural gravel burn.\nEverything you need to know. It's my\nlast video, so if you haven't seen it,\nmake [music] sure to go check it out.\nThanks for watching and see you on the\nnext one. Ciao.",

          "transcript": "At the southern tip of Africa, beneath\nskies that stretch to the horizon, a new\nchapter in cycling story begins.\n7 days and 786 kilometers, a journey of\ndreams, dust, and discovery.\nSet against the backdrop of vastly\ncontrasting landscapes, a gravel stage\nrace begins in lush coastal forests,\ntraverses the breathtaking semi- desert\nof the great Karu over rugged mountain\npasses into pristine, wild and iconic\nAfrican bushfeld. The treasures of\nnature are revealed and it all\nculminates where the big five roam free\nat Shamoiri private game reserve. It's a\ntrue proam field, bringing together some\nof the world's best riders and intrepid\namateurs, each ready to be tested on a\nscale the gravel cycling world has not\nyet seen. At the end of the day's\nendeavors, nightfalls. It's a full\nimmersion into the unique hospitality of\nthe guru. Firelight, flavors, and the\nhidden secrets of the land. When the sun\nsets on burn camp, something\nextraordinary ignites. This is Nedbank\ngravel burn.\nThe first edition of the Netbank gravel\nBurn attracted some of cycling's global\nelite ready to battle it out for a\nrecord prize purse totaling 150,000 US.\nThe field included Olympic, world, and\nnational champions from every discipline\nof the sport like Unbound 2025 runnerup\nSimon Pelo.\n&gt;&gt; On a gravel racing, you have no idea\nwhat's coming. You know, the terrain can\nchange and the the flattest stage could\nbe like the hardest in the ends.\n&gt;&gt; French national champion Ugo Dreu and\nOlympic mountain bike champion Tom\nPitcock.\n&gt;&gt; I expect a big big adventure from the\nGravel Burn, not just a race like any\nother, especially because it happens the\nfirst time, so no one really knows how\nit's going to go. I'm really looking\nforward to discover this adventure at\nthe Gravel. and Australian endurance\nkingpin Lachlan Morton. South African\nstar Matt Beers arrived at the start\nfresh from a successful season of racing\nin the United States. I think the\nNedbang gravel bone is going to just be\nunknown, rugged, gnarly,\nbut also a very cool experience.\n&gt;&gt; They came from all parts of the world to\nexperience this full service gravel\nstate race in the most remote regions of\nthe Eastern Cape in South Africa. Rivals\non the bike by day. Each night they\nrecover and regail stories together,\nforging bonds. Something rarely seen in\nany professional sport.\nFrom the coastal town of Nisner through\nForest and Prince Alfred's Pass, topping\nout at over 1,000 m, stage 1 is 84 km\nwith 2,50 m of climbing, making it a\ntruly testing introduction to the week.\nThe official start at the Murings.\nWet conditions. This is a significant\nmoment in the fledgling discipline of\ngravel racing.\nExcitement levels are high as the pro\nmen's pelaton prepared for the first of\nseven challenging stages. South African\nMarco Eubair, one of several national\nchampions in the field in the neutral\nroll out through town before facing the\ninitial climb of the day.\nThe flag dropped as they hit the slopes\nat the 3 km Simola Hill that would take\ncare of 250 m of the day's 250 m of\nclimbing\nonto the gravel for the first time. It\nwas muddy and slippery as they pedal\nthrough the forest.\nLucas Bal looking to Peter Steter for\nassistance in the pacemaking. It was a\njourney into the unknown, but the\nEuropean riders like Rammon Singleam had\ncome prepared for unseasonal garden\nroute weather.\nFormer Gilro Ditalia stage winner Chad\nHager from the United States on his\nfirst trip to South Africa and perhaps\nwondering where the sun was. The sight\nof Matt Beers and the blue and red\nspecialized off-road kit on the front\nsend shivers through the group. The tall\nSouth African was born and raised in the\nregion and knows these roads better than\nanyone.\nDespite the conditions, they flew down\nthe descents at high speed and through\nthe first and second putt style of the\nday. Hot styles, the name given by the\nevent to the service stations along the\nroute.\nThe defining climb loomed 14 kilometers\nup the Prince Alfred's pass.\nUgodu drove the pace with 19 riders in\nhis wake. Simon Pelo chased hard to\nclose a gap. The group thinned out over\nthe first 5 km. Among them a handful of\nnational champions.\nHalfway up, a group of three got away.\nBeers, Dresu, and Swiss XO star Enri\nFchnik on a special bike setup\ncustomized for this stage race. Beers\nand Dashu did the line share of work on\nthe front as Fnick did all he could to\nstay in touch. On the descents, it was\neach man for himself.\nA left off the descent and into the Zond\nfarm orchards. He led the charge into\nwhat was a twisty technical last\nkilometer.\nPrishnik ducked inside Dresu to take\nsecond position. In the sprint, he could\nnot close the gap and get around the\npowerful beers ahead of him. And the\nSouth African rounded the final corner\nto ride himself into gravel racing\nhistory as the first man to win a stage\nand wear the Asos Ember leader jersey at\nthe Nedbank gravel burn.\nThe racing was desperately close all the\nway through the standings and 48 seconds\nbetween Tristan Noki in fourth and Simon\nPelo in fifth.\nDespite the weather, the riders were\ngiven a warm welcome by the energetic\nand enthusiastic Burn Camp crew.\nThe crisp chill of the great karu\ngreeted riders ahead of stage two. Dry\nroads and champagne gravel was on the\nmenu for the 108 km to Willmore.\nThe shellot at 26 km marked as a likely\nselection point. The final 28 km of\nundulating Karu roads leads them to a\nshort but potentially decisive technical\ntrail before the finish in Willmore\nfollowed by transfer to craftet.\nI love so much the stage stage races to\nto wake up every day and to have a new\nday on the bike in the bike every day\nday after days and uh this is uh I love\nthis. I love this.\n&gt;&gt; Leaving the Zund farm in Aventur after\ntheir first night in the burn camp, the\npro men's group lead the way. Matt Beers\nin the Sosa leader jersey. the man to\nbeat.\nDan Lop Camworth and Philip Buckle were\nthe early aggressors.\nThe shellot was to be pivotal as the pig\ngroup began fragmenting as riders picked\ntheir way over the rough loose terrain.\nGerman strongman Lucas Bal used the\nshellot as his launch pad for an attack.\nPeers and Po were able to follow his\nmove as others struggled to maintain\nmomentum\non the long stretch of champagne gravel.\nThe trio did short regular turns on the\nfront and began building a lead over the\nchase group. It grew to almost a minute\nby the first putt style. With third Dun\nsecond struggling, South African chap\nMarco Yubervo Chem put his nose into the\nwind in a bold effort to try and claw\nback time on GC.\nBut the chase group was having none of\nit and worked together to close the gap\nand eventually catch Jub on the wide\nopen Ku roads.\nWhile Beers, Bal and Pelu gained more\ntime by the kilometer to over 3 minutes.\nOn the short technical trail outside\nWillmore near the finish, hello cramped\nand lost touch with his breakaway\ncompanions, leaving Lucas Bowman and\nMatt Beers to fight it out for the stage\non the main road leading into town. And\nit was the power of the leader Beers\nthat prevailed as he timed his move\nperfectly to take his second consecutive\nstage win ahead of Bal and Bell.\nAnother day in the ASOS Ember jersey for\nbeers.\nKaru hospitality was at its best in\nWillmore as the field rolled into town.\nA chance to recover, refuel, and cool\ndown before being transferred to their\nnext burn camp in the jewel of the Karu\nCaranet.\nThe 126-year-old Union High School\nhosted the burn camp in the fourth\noldest town in South Africa. Stage 3 was\n90 km deep into the Great Karu, where\nlivestock and landscape exist in rugged\nharmony.\nThose who warmed up would relish the 43\nkm of gradual but continuous climbing up\nto the stage high point at Conicle Peak.\nA fast technical descent followed before\nmore of the 1450 meters of accumulated\nclimbing led them to the Blavat farm for\nthe first of two nights in a beautiful\nremote burn camp.\nI hope it's not like every everyday\nfingersh deal because it's going to be a\ntough week. Yeah, today is almost only\nso it's going to be a lot of pushing on\nthe pedals here.\n&gt;&gt; A blast from the Kuruhorn and they were\ngiven a rousing send off.\nThe stunning Arasmus Cliff Road took\nthem towards Conigle Peak. Well settled\ninto the rhythm of the Nedbank gravel\nburn. The riders were keen to test each\nother. The stakes were high as was the\npace.\nThe lead group began breaking up in the\nSunday's River Valley with all the GC\ncontenders fighting for position in the\ndust. Gravel racing at its best. On the\nfinal short drag towards the finish\nline, Ugodu went early, but his timing\nwas out and Simon Pell launched a\ncounterattack.\n&gt;&gt; I tried a move like uh on the railway\ncrossing. It was pretty sketchy and I\nsaw that behind me was no mat and no\nLucas B either. So I thought, okay, I\nshould try to just put a little pressure\non for a couple of kilometers and I\nsplit the group.\nAnd the Swiss stars tactics paid\nhandsome dividends as he blazed past\nRishu to join Matt Beers as a stage\nwinner of Nedbank Gravelburn 2025.\n&gt;&gt; It's been perfect to play a final for me\ntoday.\n&gt;&gt; Beers was fourth 8 seconds behind Pelu,\nreducing his overall lead to 55 seconds\nover the Swiss.\nThe Nedbank Travel Burn brought a unique\nevent to Blava to farm, the night burn.\nRiders had qualified on stage two on the\nRed Bull Kilometer for the short lap\nrace lit by blazing fire light. It was a\nhigh-paced adrenalinefueled bonfire lit\nchase the Fox criterium style race as\nthe riders were hunted down and picked\noff by none other than psychic superstar\nTom Pitcock.\n&gt;&gt; So the idea is a bit of a fox chase.\nYeah, we have 35 riders I believe. They\nset off they have half lap head start\nand then last man standing win. So I've\ngot the hard jump.\nThat was a lot of fun. I mean, uh,\nhaving such a such a cool thing in the\nevening, entertaining people,\nentertaining ourselves, and, uh, that's\na super cool idea. I I hope everyone\nenjoys it.\n&gt;&gt; An energetic, fun night after a great\nday's gravel riding.\nStage four, the only loop stage of the\nrace, was 111 km into some of the most\nremote farmlands in the country. Five\nclimbs defined the stage and they start\nearly with Taffel Corp and Liop. The\nmid-stage compass is a challenge before\nOwl Hill and a return over Taffelp.\nHaving traveled over 300 km from the\ncoast, they were now at 1,400 m above\nsea level, which brought its own\nchallenges.\nWe're obviously at like quite high\naltitude here in comparison to all the\nother days. So I think that might play a\npart. And obviously there's quite a bit\nof wind. So I believe on top of the\nplateau there's going to be even more\nwind.\nThis is in the middle of the wilderness\nhere in the Ku. A different experience\nfor me for South Africa.\nBut this raw wild that's the real\ngravel. Here it is. Here we are in the\nmiddle of nowhere. That's what I came\nfor.\n&gt;&gt; All primed and ready to roll into the\ngreat karu under the call from the kudu\nhorn.\nThe out and back loop from Blava to camp\ncarried both opportunities and risks for\nstage hunters and GC contenders. Taffel\nCorp climb whittleled the group down to\n16 after 8 km. The second test came 6 km\nlater and they got up and over Leop\nstill altogether. The stunning wide open\nexpanses of the gorgeous Newberg Nature\nReserve was a sight for sore eyes. They\nhad a dramatic close quarter encounter\nwith a trio builder that roam the\nbeautiful plains.\nA block headwin made life difficult as\ndid an injection of pace from Matt Beers\nup the compass climb.\nA lead group of eight descended off the\nNewberg range into New Bethesda. All the\nmain protagonists were intact as they\nswung through the 150-year-old town. The\nfireworks were lit by Pel with a\nstunning attack. His closest GC rival\nwas the only one who could stay with the\nSwiss and together Beers and Pel opened\na big gap on the chasers. Po went hard\nup the second ascent of Taff, but an\nexhibition of fearless descending by\nBeers ensured that he was able to keep\nPo at bay on the high-speed drag to the\nfinish line.\nA third stage win added 2 seconds to his\nlead. Lucas B in third lost time to a\npuncture and he was just 20 seconds\nahead of Ugo Dresu.\nToday was actually pretty nice and like\nthe gravel was really good. There was a\nfew sections of kind of rough but\nyesterday was way rougher. It's been a\nmagical way to start this and um yeah,\nanything from now is bonus I think. Um\nyeah, I'm obviously going to fight till\nthe end.\nSunrise on day five for the burn\ncommunity. The four days of camping in\nAventu, Kraent, and Blava had been an\nunusual but deeply fulfilling\nexperience. Genuine Karu hospitality had\nensured that both local and\ninternational riders were fully immersed\nin the first midbank gravel burn.\nStage 5 transitioned to Marino, 137 km\naway. Over half the riders on tar roads,\nbut the sting in the tail came with a\nsummit finish at the top of the swazuk\npass.\nWith four days in the legs and a testing\nstage ahead, the group eased into their\nwork as they left Blava to burn camp. 5\nkm in and beers had a first mechanical\nissue of the week with a puncture.\nToyota specialized teammate Johan Sale\ndonated his wheel to the race leader\nbefore Travis Steedman guided him safely\nback to the group. The intensity\nincreased as they made their way towards\nthe Fisher River Valley. Only a handful\nhad dropped off the big lead group. Tom\nPitcock was still in the mix, but the\nfinal climb ahead. The stage was\nanyone's. At the base of the 11 km\nSwazuk pass, German champion Andreas\nSevolt launched a bold attack. He was\nafter a stage win. Those behind were\nplaying the long game in the GC battle.\nThe former marathon motorbike world\nchampion led by over a minute at best.\nBut then having kept his powder dry for\n4 days, Tom Pitcock left the main group\nand began chasing down Sevolt.\n6 kilometers from the top, Pitcock\ncaught and passed Sevolt. The double\nOlympic mounted by gold medalist was out\nto prove a point and he did so\nemphatically.\nHe crossed the line on the Swazuk pass\nto add a stage win at the Nedbank double\nburn to his impressive Palmare.\nThere was drama in the GC battle. Simon\nBelor sliced 24 seconds of Beers's lead\nas the race leader rolled home in fifth\nplace.\nJust over half a minute after five\nstages is testament to the quality of\nthe field and the intensity of the\nracing. Dishu went into third with BA in\nfourth a minute and 46 seconds back.\nWhile the inaugural Medbank gravel burn\nwas defined by what happened on the\nbike, much of the experience unfolded\noff it. Each night the riders stayed in\ntemporary burn camps where all their pre\nand postrace needs were met.\nEntertainment, worldclass local food and\nrecovery massages.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the camp life is also adventure. I\nthink the fact that they put everything\nin circles with the campfire master and\nthings like that, it's very special.\n&gt;&gt; The camaraderie and the people coming\ntogether and the and the war stories of\nevery day are really brilliant. You\nknow, you just hear everybody is an\nequal actually in this space and we all\ntrying to get through every day and it's\namazing.\nStage six was the queen stage at 144 km.\nIt was the longest of the race with 1700\nm of climbing. Tarta Bhuta and Wneck\nPass were the big challenges the riders\nwould deal with.\nHowever, due to the fickle weather and\ngusting high winds, the decision was\ntaken to neutralize the stage. This was\ndone in the best interests of the riders\nand the decision was welcomed by the\nfield. While they didn't race the\ncourse, all the riders still got to\nfully experience the entire 144 km. It\nwas a special day with dramatic\nlandscapes, remote roads, and lush dairy\nfarms.\nA grand finish at Chamari Private Game\nReserve awaited on stage 7. 111\nkilometers would flash by in a world of\nemotion and game sightings before\nNedbank gravel burn legends were\ncelebrated at the spectacular burn camp\nin the heart of big five territory.\nThe GC was set up for a thrilling\nfinale. Just 33 seconds is all that\nseparated Matt Beers from Simon Pelo.\nand less than five minutes between Dresu\nin third and Steman in sixth. No\nmotivation in high for sure that uh I'm\nalso like conscientious of what's\npossible to do and uh what can happen\nand I know that I'm here under numbered\nalso I'm alone but never full country be\nbehind him so it's going to be a tough\nuh a tough one for me\n&gt;&gt; with the stake so high who was going to\nroll the dice first\nI'm a double Olympic triathon champion\nAlistister Brownley were keen to race.\nThen B and Gega pulled the pelaton at\nhigh speed. After stage six, it was\nclear all the top men wanted something\nout of the final stage.\nThe prestige of winning at Shamoiri was\nnot lost on these men.\nThe river crossings at spot riders port\ncaused some to lose time but not as much\nas Andreas Sevolt who was among a number\nwho suffered mechanical issues. Tom\nPitcock was another with a puncture as\nthe rest of the group charged towards\nAlisdale.\nThere were two races, one for the stage\nand one among the GC contenders.\nA three-man group escaped but Namibian\nchampion Alex Miller faded back. A honen\nsale was then dropped as Lucas\nPostelberger went on a solo raid. The\nAustrian champion has great pedigree on\nthe road. He's a Jirro ditalia stage\nwinner.\nBeers drove hard. Arm Nars Dresu\nSteedman Failen Nokia allin. Once\ncaught, Fostelberger joined Steman,\nBeers, and Nokia in the race to Shamari.\nBut luck deserted the Austrian. a\ndropped chain costing him a shot at a\nstage win.\nNoir was losing air from his rear tire,\nleaving beers secure in the overall\nthanks in no small measure to the work\ndone by Steedman to usher his loyal\nteammate to the finish and a\nwelldeserved stage win.\nA fitting nod of gratitude from the\nSpecialized Off-Road star who became the\nfirst winner of the Nedbank gravel burn.\nHis final margin of victory over Simon\nPelo was 5 minutes and 26 seconds.\n&gt;&gt; See the inaugural net bank double burn.\nIt lived up to its reputation. I'm glad\nthe racing could be full guys today. It\nwas a really nice route. Yeah. Hopefully\nit grows to be a huge event in the\nfuture and then when I'm old and that I\ncan say that I won the first\nThe Shamwari Burn Camp was a wash with\nemotional energy and rhythmic beauty\nafter what was for every rider a week to\nsavor. Ready for the burn celebration.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's been it's been super good. I\nmean, smooth roads, bunch riding.\n&gt;&gt; It was good fun.\n&gt;&gt; Stopped some giraffes and zebras.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's been good fun. I've enjoyed\nit.

So\nyeah, it's a it's a race to remember. I\nwill come back for sure\nto finish um the last 30k there through\nthe through the game reserve was\namazing.

          "transcript": "South Africa, seven stages, 800 km of\ngravel. They call it gravel burn.\nThe longest and hardest gravel stage\nrace on the planet. This is my story of\nwhat went down. The highs, the lows, the\nmoments that nearly broke us, and the\nones that made it all worth it. When\nAzos invited me to take part in the\ninaugural gravel burn, I knew it would\nbe a real challenge. So, let's get\nstraight into the route. It would be\ndivided up into seven different stages,\nstarting on the coast and heading across\nthe western and eastern capes into the\nKaru Desert and finishing right at the\nShamari Wildlife Reserve.\nIt was to be my longest ever race I'd\never taken part in. I had entered myself\ninto the elite field, which meant I was\nup against some of the most talented\nriders in the world. Tom Pickock headed\nthe lineup for Olympic mountain bike\nchampion and an old teammate of mine\nfrom my road racing days. We were told\nthat we had to ride in the same jersey\nall week. So as sent me my favorite\njersey and then it was time to start\nstage one absolute madness. Pretty grim,\npretty wet, pretty cold.\nSo first night in the campsite. This is\nmy little tent here. What a stage the\nfirst one was. It was enough to\nabsolutely finish a whole pair of brake\npads. Oh, and we all got cold and wet.\nBut luckily, there's a fire on every\ncampsite to warm us back up again and\ndry our clothes crucially.\nFirst day down, six to go.\n&gt;&gt; The next morning, we were awoken by an\nincredible sight. An extremely cold\nnight has frozen anything left outside.\n&gt;&gt; What the? That's the weirdest thing I've\never done in my life.\n&gt;&gt; Why are you sitting there?\n&gt;&gt; Cuz I saw you opening the thing. I was\nwalking. I was walking.\n&gt;&gt; Smile, guys.\n&gt;&gt; Good morning. It's cold.\n&gt;&gt; It's really cold.\nIt's 4°, but it went below freezing last\nnight because there is a frost and\neverything's frozen,\n&gt;&gt; including my tent.\n&gt;&gt; Did you wake up with your feet frozen?\n&gt;&gt; I woke up at like 3:00 in the morning\nwith my feet frozen and I put like three\npairs of socks on and then I I thought I\nwas going to die, but I made it. And I\nthink I have all of my toes still.\n&gt;&gt; Let me introduce the team, the four\nAzulos ambassadors who took on this\nchallenge. Maliza Rowlings, Justin\nWeekes, Virginia Canelari, and myself,\nBoris Carpenter, with the task of\ncapturing it all. I'd be riding my\ntrusty race setup I've been using all\nyear, my Van Risal CGR set up with 45 mm\ntires, tubeless, of course. Anyway,\nenough\ntomorrow. Fire it up. Slow down for no\none. You know who charged up.\n&gt;&gt; With over 800 km racing, it is\nimpossible to show you everything that\nwent down out there. However, I can give\nyou a sense of what it looked like. It\nwas rode full gas at the front. And of\ncourse, I wanted to be there.\nUnfortunately for me, this was going to\nbe really, really hard. And it meant\nfighting every day to try and hopefully\nstay with the second group on the road\nif I could with the hope of seeing a top\n20 if everything came together. A couple\nof days pushed me totally over my limit\nand I accepted that I would have a\nslightly easier day out the back in the\nhope that I could recover more. I've\ndropped off going to take today a little\nbit easier because yesterday it's really\ntaken out of me. This did give me the\nopportunity however to see exactly what\nwas going on in the age group races\nbehind and of course the elite women's\nrace. And just look back and I can see\nthe leader of the amateur race in the\nAzos leaders orange jersey coming.\nYo,\n&gt;&gt; come on, guys. Let's go.\n&gt;&gt; Go on. Come on. Action.\nLA. Go on.\n&gt;&gt; My favorite stage had to be stage 4.\nThere was an 80 km tarmac section and\nhaving made it over the first climb in\nthe front group. The pace went totally\nout of the race. Everyone was looking\naround, having fun, taking in the\nsurroundings, messing about at the back\nof the race.\n&gt;&gt; First bit of tarmac this race. Oh, so\ngood. I love tarmac.\n&gt;&gt; This is fun, huh?\n&gt;&gt; We're the backseat bad boys.\n&gt;&gt; 100 watts at the back, mate.\n&gt;&gt; Of course, Tom Pickock couldn't help\nhimself from doing Tom Pickock things.\n&gt;&gt; And I even had the opportunity to share\nsome of my snack supply on the road.\n&gt;&gt; Should have brought my do some emails.\nThis was also the day I was to have my\nbest result of the week as the stage\nfinished up a mountain which was\nbasically a 20-minute test and I got oh\nso close to my top 20 goal finishing in\n21st position on the stage but Tom Pigok\nwon.\n&gt;&gt; So stage five hilltop finish completed.\nThat was a really hard day out there.\nHow was it for you Hugo?\n&gt;&gt; I'm pretty happy. Uh this morning I was\nuh fourth in GC and now third. So\n&gt;&gt; Oh, amazing.\n&gt;&gt; Was the goal was the goal today. Don't\nI'm uh I'm happy.\n&gt;&gt; Two more stages to go.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly. Now it's uh to be focused\nto to save my my podium.\n&gt;&gt; Exactly. Exactly. And now we have to go\ndown there\n&gt;&gt; in the compound. In the compound.\n&gt;&gt; I see it.\n&gt;&gt; Amazing.\n&gt;&gt; The giraffe today.\n&gt;&gt; The giraffe.\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n&gt;&gt; You saw giraffe. I I did not see\ngiraffe.\n&gt;&gt; Later on, after we'd been welcomed back\ninto camp, I spoke to Virginia to see\nhow she was holding up after almost 400\nkm of racing.\n&gt;&gt; Virginia, we've done five stages.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n&gt;&gt; we've got two to go. How are you feeling\nwith all the this camping and all of\nthis, you know, being outside for so\nlong?\n&gt;&gt; Body's tired, but I actually feel good\ncuz I I felt really bad on the first few\ndays. So, even if I'm supposed to be\nmore tired now, I actually start feeling\nbetter now. Um, yeah, body is tired and\nlots of sun, lots of heat. But, uh,\nyeah, I'm happy. It was lovely to come\nhere. And I think also landscape got\nmore interesting.\n&gt;&gt; The whole group I was with today,\napparently they saw a giraffe out there.\nI didn't see it. Did you see any\nwildlife out there today? No.\n&gt;&gt; Me neither. I didn't see an animal.\n&gt;&gt; Not a single one.\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; Not even a sheep.\n&gt;&gt; Not even Oh, well, maybe a sheep. Yes.\nEven a cow.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nAs the race unfolded, I was more amazed\nevery day with the sheer scale of the\noperation and the size of the team\nrequired. Pretty much every day, we\nwould rock up to what was previously an\nempty field, and the team had set up a\nwhole town with hundreds of our tents,\nan array of larger tents to chill out in\nwith sofas fully equipped with snacks\nand access to a fully stocked bar. Also\nset up were multiple slightly larger,\nmore permanent shower and toilet blocks\nscattered around, meaning you were never\nthat far for a walk away. Every night\nyou had your very own tent equipped with\na camping bed, mattress, a tent light,\ncamping chair, and a small table,\nmeaning all you had to bring was a\nsleeping bag, and a pillow.\n&gt;&gt; As you can see, it's a nice amount of\nspace. Some people are taking the bike\ninside and sleeping with the bike for\npeace of mind. Uh, as you can see, I can\npretty much stand upright in here\nalmost. Each meal was fully catered for.\nBreakfast, lunch, and dinner of local\ncaru cuisine.\n&gt;&gt; How good does that look?\n&gt;&gt; At the start of the week, much to the\nrers's frustration, porridge was\nmissing. But this was soon rectified. My\nhighlight was a coffee truck that\nfollowed us every step of the way. And\nfor those essential evening hot\nchocolates,\nwe woke up to what was supposed to be\nstage six to a bit of madness.\n&gt;&gt; Morning.\nOh, bike's gone. Bike's gone. I\n&gt;&gt; think there's been a storm. Oh my last\nnight. I've never worn earplugs in my\nwhole life. And last night I had to put\nthem in because the tent felt like it\nwas going to take off. But hey, it's the\npenultimate day. Ciao.\n&gt;&gt; We headed over to have breakfast as\nusual, but we were evacuated mid-mouth\nbecause the winds were threatening the\nvery structure above us.\n&gt;&gt; It's no longer safe. Okay, thank you.\n&gt;&gt; Where do I put my bowl? Here.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I just dropped this.\n&gt;&gt; What have we just been asked to do?\n&gt;&gt; Leave the tank. It's not safe.\n&gt;&gt; It's not safe, Justin.\n&gt;&gt; We've decided to film it before we\nbefore we leave.\n&gt;&gt; A scene of utter chaos erupted. No one\nreally knew what was going to happen.\n&gt;&gt; What's going on, Juliet?\n&gt;&gt; Well, THE WIND IS SO STRONG I CAN'T STOP\nLAUGHING. ACTUALLY,\n&gt;&gt; you probably got a lot of sand in your\nporridge.\n&gt;&gt; I was holding it like that as I was\nwalking along, not being able to see.\nWhat are they going to do with us all?\n&gt;&gt; Well, I don't know how they're going to\nget us to the next point pointto-oint\nrace. And they haven't got the buses to\ntake us there. So, do you think we're\ngoing to ride?\n&gt;&gt; I hope not.\n&gt;&gt; I don't think we'll make it.\n&gt;&gt; No. So, they they'll figure something\nout. The organizers are really good,\naren't they?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they are. They're great.\n&gt;&gt; We were told to walk to the main field\nwhere they would make a decision.\nWhat's going on?\n&gt;&gt; Somewhat some wind.\n&gt;&gt; I thought they were in the tent. I went\na little bit.\n&gt;&gt; No, wait.\n&gt;&gt; As this was being communicated, the\ntorrential rain returned and everyone\nran for cover.\n&gt;&gt; We're hiding from a windstorming rain\nand they've had us in a field and then\nwe're all going to die. It's really\nscary. The stage is not happening now.\nMaybe it's going to happen later. They\nwere saying, \"We didn't want you to die\nalone.\" We said, \"If we're going to die,\nwe're going to die together.\"\n&gt;&gt; All together. Yeah. Like a real team.\n&gt;&gt; But now the rain has stopped. The blue\nsky has started to appear. And we're\nracing bikes in 1 hour. Everyone is\nexcited to go. Isn't that right,\nVirginia?\n&gt;&gt; Yay!\n&gt;&gt; Look at Look at that excited face.\n&gt;&gt; News spread that the start would be\ndelayed by 1 hour. Then there was some\ndiscussion on what the plan should be\nbefore deciding it would be fully\nneutralized until the first V zone. We\nset out onto the course, making out for\na lack of breakfast and taking advantage\nof the slower pace.\n&gt;&gt; What have you got there?\n&gt;&gt; Are you going to keep me?\n&gt;&gt; No, I'm joking.\n&gt;&gt; Another one.\n&gt;&gt; However, it wasn't long before this\nhappened. A gust of wind had blown a\nrider fully off the road and he had\nlanded badly, knocking himself\nunconscious.\n&gt;&gt; The team responded really fast and the\nwhole stage was fully neutralized.\n&gt;&gt; Neutralized at the end of the race,\n&gt;&gt; allowing people to cover the rest of the\nstage at their own pace.\n&gt;&gt; What's going on, Adam?\n&gt;&gt; We are deep in the art of the bush.\n&gt;&gt; It's hot. It's rocky.\n&gt;&gt; Body's on the ground. Not what you want\nto see.\nNeutral.\nBig easy day.\n&gt;&gt; Neutral kilome.\n&gt;&gt; How's the neutral going for you? Neutral\nis very long today. Feeling is good.\nFound my buddy Lawrence putting me out\nof the wind. Nice. I'm happy. Just the\ntwo Lawrenes chilling at the back.\nRight.\nHey, one in Rafa and one in Azos. Damn.\nWell, finished with day six. That was\nthe most crazy day I think I've ever had\non a bike. From the most insane storms\nthis morning to a cancelled stage or a\nneutralized stage, a really bad crash,\nbacon, sunshine, hail to roll in,\nlightning, thunder. I think I've lived\nnine lives today. 5 hours on the bike\ntoday. That was a big 144 km.\n&gt;&gt; I think that's the most extreme change\nin weather conditions. Yeah. I've ever\nexperienced in my entire life. Never\nmind. On a bike.\n&gt;&gt; All of us. You guys overreact about\neverything, bro. It was a\n&gt;&gt; Hey,\n&gt;&gt; don't clean yourself. It's too good.\n&gt;&gt; What was it for you up there?\n&gt;&gt; So, I actually enjoyed.\n&gt;&gt; I think the the route was amazing. Was\nsuper nice.\nBut I liked it.\n&gt;&gt; You went fast today. We've only just got\nhere like 10 minutes, 15 minutes.\n&gt;&gt; In the end, I catch Black Lon and I was\non his wheels. I was like,\n&gt;&gt; get dinner, Lawrence.\n&gt;&gt; It's the end of the day.\n&gt;&gt; End of the day. One more day left.\n&gt;&gt; Justin's been working really hard.\n&gt;&gt; Been working really hard on everything\nall the time for you.\n&gt;&gt; Swany duty on Lawrence and Virginia all\nweek.\n&gt;&gt; He needs to carve up.\n&gt;&gt; Carve up. The organizers had thought of\neverything. Each stage had a GPX file\nwith a fully marked race route, all with\nfull race support services, including\nthis guy who stopped to help me when I\nwas unable to fix a puncher myself.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we had some bad luck on this\nsection. Just 10k to go. It would be\njust before the end. I was trying not to\nget too carried away, but I was just in\nfront of the woman, so I was going a\nlittle bit faster than maybe I should\nhave done.\n&gt;&gt; Okay. Yeah, but these rocks are gnarly,\ndude.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they're not. They're not these\ntires.\n&gt;&gt; They're sharp, huh? Nutrition at service\nstations along the route named pedestals\nwas supplied. Here you could find\neverything you could imagine, including\nrace jars, cake, banana, sweets, and of\ncourse liquids. If you were unlucky\nenough to have an accident, of which\nthere were a few, there was a full race\nmedical tent set up at the finish and\naccess to aid out on course as well.\nAfter every stage, we gave in our bike\nwhere it would be pressure washed so it\nwould be clean for each new day. For an\nextra fee, which I ended up purchasing,\nwas various servicing packages for a\nwhole army of mechanics on site. It was\nnice to have the peace of mind that your\nbike is going to be looked at, any\nproblems fixed and ready to go for the\nmorning. One thing I was a little\nworried about was charging all my\ndevices I needed to charge. They had\nthought of this and a little truck had\nbeen provided at the campsite each night\nwith little boxes and a key where you\ncould put your charge back. Finally, for\nme, something I need not worry about was\nthis machine, which was a Starlink setup\nto beam highspeed Wi-Fi for those of us\nwho knew it.\nSo, a very good morning from the final\nstage here from campsite. Just had some\nbreakfast. The sun is out for our last\nday and today we head towards the\nShamari Wildlife Reserve. We made it to\nthe last day. Eliza, how are we feeling?\nWe've got the skin suit on.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we got the speed suit going.\nEverything's sore. everything.\nEspecially my arms. So sorry.\n&gt;&gt; Just excited to get it done.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. Let's do this.\n&gt;&gt; Final day, mate.\n&gt;&gt; I wouldn't say good. I said um yeah, I'm\nlooking forward to a shower. But no,\nit's been amazing. It's been so cool.\nYou know, This is not as\n&gt;&gt; we had completed the gravel burn, burned\nout but aware of what we had\naccomplished. The men's race was sewn up\nalready with Matt Beers, the South\nAfrican hero, taking home the GC win.\nBut the women's race came right down to\nthe wire with Axel Dubo Provo taking\nhome the leaders embers jersey on the\nvery last stage and taking it to the\npodium. Then it was time for the burn\ncelebration party after stage seven at\nthe Shimari private game reserve. A\nchance to thank all the sponsors, all\nthe organizers, and enjoy what we had\naccomplished. So if you're wondering\nwhether you need to put this race on\nyour bucket list, for me it's an easy\nanswer. A massive thanks to Azos of\nSwitzerland for making it possible and\nto every rider who shared the trails.\ngravel burn. One of the hardest,\nwildest, and most unforgettable weeks on\na bike.\nSo, some stats. 800 km ridden, 20,345\ncalories burnt, 24 bottles consumed, 41\nsturka gels, and 13 zebras spotted. So,\nseven stages completed. We've woken up\non the eighth day. It's kind of weird\nnot to be uh getting dressed into Lyra\nand going for stage eight. I'm ready for\nit. And also, it seems like everyone\nelse is since they've all left at 6:00\na.m. this morning and now we're going on\n10:00 and we're the only ones here.\nFeeling a little bit tired this morning.\nNot going to lie. Probably look it as\nwell. But what a week. What an\nincredible week. Thanks for watching and\nwe'll see you on the next one.\nGet me.",

          "transcript": "Heat. Heat.\n[music]\nCranet steeped in history is a\ntraveler's refuge for the harsh hostile\nsemi- desert. of the great karu. The\nburn camp at Union High offered the\ncommunity of riders all they needed to\nprepare for stage three at the Nedbank\ngravel burn the fuel to fire up the body\nand caring hands to soothe tired legs.\nThe elixir challenges jersey was\npresented and proudly worn by the\nbiggest GC mover amongst the amateur\n[music] age group riders.\nThe stage winners at GC leaders across\nall categories [music] edge their names\nonto the Toyota Fortuna leaders car\nbefore the action from stage three.\nLet's look back at stage two.\nLeaving the Zond farm in Aventur after\ntheir first night in a burn camp, the\nmen's elite group headed for Willmore\n108 km away.\nMatt Beer is in Assass leaders jersey.\nThe bright ochre color marking him as\nthe man to beat.\n&gt;&gt; [music]\n&gt;&gt; As they left Unionale on the first\ngravel, Dan Lopshire, Cameron Worf and\nPhilip Buckle set off on [music] what\nwould ultimately be a doomed attack.\nOn the private farm track, leading to\nthe feared Shellot climb, a pivotal\n[music] race defining course. German\nstrongman Lucas Bal attacked,\ntaking with him Beers, Simon [music]\nPelu, and Tristan Noir.\nThe brutal steep ascent was for many\nriders a nightmare of rocks, stones, and\nloose terrain, [music] stunting momentum\nand forcing them off their bikes on\noccasion as they dug deep to reach the\nsummit.\nThe carnage was real and the [music]\npelaton was shattered. The powerhouses\nof balm and beers prevailed\non the district road. Thereafter, they\nwere joined by Simon Pel and the trio\ngot to work doing short regular turns on\nthe front. They [music] were able to\nsteadily increase their advantage on the\nchase group.\nFor second on GC, Andre Fishnik [music]\ndropping back and third, Ugo Dresser\nalso struggling. National champion Marco\nEub of South Africa tried to gain some\ntime on GC as did his teammate Tristan\nNokia.\nEventually they too were caught.\nBut if you don't succeed at first, try\nagain. and Uber Bear, a fearless\nattacker, went to the front again.\nBut the hunting hungry pack behind soon\nhauled him in, [music]\nleaving Lucas Bal and Matt Beers to\nfight it out for the win. And Beers's\nfeared power prevailed. He took a second\nconsecutive stage [music] victory ahead\nof the hardworking German with Simon\nPelude 14 seconds back in third.\nFamiliar position top step again for\nBeers as he extended his overall [music]\nlead to 63 seconds. Balloon's good day\nmoved the Swiss into second 45 seconds\nclear of [music] Lucas Bound.\nThe women's elite bunch was still all\ntogether when they hit the gravel out of\nUnionale. Leader Axel Duba Prevo not\nquite as distinctive with a black Gilele\nover her ember leaders jersey. The\nShelotra stage defining as well. Melissa\nRollins was first to dismount. Haley Pin\nlasted a little longer before she too\nhad to run her bike to the top. The pair\nsummited together once down on the road\nthey opened a small gap to the rest.\nBut with the race leader and motivated\nchases in hot pursuit, the lead was\nshortlived and they were caught by\nDubois Prevo Mulman Pacio Rollins,\nOlivia Hoter and Haley Smith. The group\ngot [music] bigger. Lawrence Stevens and\nWhitney Allison bridged across to them.\nAllison though was first to lose ground\nas the road tilted uphill [music]\ntowards the finish at Willmore.\nThe long drag to the last right hand\ncorner saw small gaps appear.\nThe fight to get into the corner first\nwas real. Melissa Rollins leading Haley\nPin and Dubois [music] Prevo in.\nThe unlucky South African Pin was to\npunch her and a chance of victory gone.\nRollins drove hard for the line, but\nDubo Preba hunted down first Haley Smith\nand then Rollins and powered past the\nAmerican [music] to secure a second\nconsecutive stage win in thrilling\nfashion on the streets of Willmore.\nThe French champions advantage over\nMulman Pacio just 13 seconds. Rollins in\nthird 146 down bringing a further 21\nseconds back.\nStarting in the historic town of\nKafernet, stage three was 90 km into the\ndeep [music] great Karu where livestock\nand landscape exist in rugged harmony.\nThose who warmed up will relish the 43\nkm of continuous climbing to Conicle\nPeak.\nA glance at the sharpointed compass bar\ncould be costly [music] in the rough\ndescents before more than450 m of\nclimbing leads them to the burn camp for\nthe [music] first of two nights under\nthe stars at beautiful Blaua farms.\nThey were heading deep into the remote\nhostile environment of the ancient\nlandscape of the great Karu where only\nthe strong, resilient and resourceful\nsurvive.\n&gt;&gt; It's a beautiful day. So, I'm [music]\nexcited for the weather cuz I have the\nfeeling I'm learning every day 100\nthings like not only on the bike, also\noff the bike. I'm really getting out of\nmy comfort zone. I have to take care\nabout my own material. Yeah, I'm just\ntrying to soak everything in and just\nenjoy and learn every day.\n&gt;&gt; It's really cool just the whole vibe. I\nmean, today is a very special day and\nseeing all the kids come out. Um,\n&gt;&gt; yeah. And to be racing around the bird\nand racing in the African event and\nshowing off our beautiful country. I\nlove that.\n&gt;&gt; I hope it's not like every everyday Faza\ndeal because it's going to be a tough\nweek. Yeah. Today is almost only uphill,\nso it's going to be a lot of pushing on\nthe pedals here.\n[screaming]\nA 90 km stage dominated by relentless\nclimbing was a fitting playground for\nthese super strong athletes to fight it\nout for stage honors.\nThe big pack stayed together for much of\nthe early kilometers out of craftet.\nWeary of the day's big climb to the\nsummit of Conicle [music] Hill.\nOne man though was prepared to roll the\ndice. Lucas Poselberger. Clad all in\nwhite, the Austrian champion engaged\npower mode and quickly began building a\nlead that would grow to almost a minute\nat best. His general classification\nplacing of 10 minutes off the lead and\nthe boldness of his early move saw the\nrest of the field allow him the freedom\nto ride on into the mountains. [music]\nFor the first time in the race, Tom\nPitcock was at the front of the big\ngroup, testing his legs perhaps and\nlaying the foundations for an allout\nassault on a stage later in the week.\n[music] Pitcock is 1 hour and 46 minutes\noff the pace, so no threat to the\noverall.\nAs Postlberger rode on up ahead and the\ngroup rode [music] gently on behind him,\nthe roads gradually rose through the\nArasmus curve towards the Karu\nmountains, giving the riders a glimpse\ninto the rough view and raw beauty of\nthe Great [music] Karu, where water is a\ncherished commodity. When it does rain,\nthe water carves a deep path through the\nearth. [music]\n&gt;&gt; Horselberger came prepared. Wearing a\nhydration pack and carrying two bottles.\nHe was up for the challenge of riding\nsolo.\nThe short undulations testing his legs.\nThe flats without any wind. A relative\nbreeze for a man who's ridden on the\nworld tour for many, many years.\nHe kept looking over his shoulder to see\nif there was anyone prepared to join him\n[music] on the break.\nNone so bold or brave just at this\nstage.\nBut there was an increase in the tempo.\nA long chase group no longer bunched up,\nbut finding a line on the right hand\nside of these broad gravel roads cutting\nthrough the Great Karu. [music]\nThe main protagonist starting to show\ntheir teeth as they closed in on the\nfirst [music] putt style.\nHostelberger would arrive at that\n[music] butt style first.\nThe name for the refreshment stop along\nthe roots of the Nedbank gravel burn\nderived from the Africans word meaning\nroad stop in English. No stopping here\nfor the Austrian champion. Pedal on. He\ndid.\nIn 2017\nput his name in lights when he won the\nfirst stage of the Jirro dital italia.\nputting him in the Malia Rosa, the race\nleaders [music] jersey for a couple of\ndays.\nThat would establish him as a serious\ncontender on the road. And here he is, a\nserious contender on the gravel as well.\nSteady tempo, but the unrelenting\nundulations were starting to take a toll\non the Austrian.\n&gt;&gt; The big rocky climb coming up would be\nan opportunity for anyone out of this\nbunch to launch an attack and try and\nshut down the Austrian who was just over\n55 seconds ahead. And it was to be as\nTristan Noia of Ibuko Chem Champ\nlaunched set attack. [music]\nOn the steeper climbs, he closed the gap\ndown by 50 seconds. And by the time he\ngot to the top, he was just 6 seconds\nbehind Postelberger [music]\nand closing in rapidly on the Austrian.\nBehind him, the bunch was almost 20\nseconds a drift. Nokia pedling strong\nand fast urged Postelberger to join him.\nBut the Austrian was a spent force.\nHe sat with the South African for a\nkilometer before the road went uphill\nagain. [music]\nAnd Nokia showing his superb skill\nsummited Conicle Peak alone some 12\nseconds ahead of the chase bunch which\nhad been whittleled down to some 12\nriders in hot pursuit of the Ibuka Chem\nChamp rider constantly aware of the\ndanger of the firepower behind him.\nTristan Noir was keeping an eye on them.\nLong line of riders highly motivated\nnow. Hostelber just hanging on the back.\nUgo was in there and Simon Po, the man\nin second place on general\nclassification was leading the charge.\nSoon he was brought to heal and again\n[music] Pitcock was there. Signs that\nthe Olympic mountain bike champion was\nstarting to feel good on the descent. It\nwas fast, it was relentless, but these\nsuperbly skilled athletes dealing with\nall the obstacles impeccably.\nThis is gravel racing at its most\nbrutal. Fast and furious. Risks are\ntaken, caution is put aside, and\noccasionally some of the very best\nriders in the world get it wrong as\nGriffinista did, nursing a painful\nfinger and a stricken bike. Bad luck for\nthe American who was inside the top 10.\nAnd they were all in now.\nChrist Nokia Chad Haguff\nand refresh neck on his hard tail\nmountain bike. Lucas B.\nRough, wet, rocky river crossing saw 15\nriders get across and still Tom Pitcock\nwas in the frame.\nIt was [music] a game of cat and mouse.\nNine riders fighting for victory. Who\nwas going to win it?\nYou're watching the Nedbank gravel burn\nstage three.\nWell, let's [music] hear from one of the\nriders right in the heat of battle.\n&gt;&gt; I tried a move like uh on the railway\ncrossing. It was pretty sketchy and I\nsaw that behind me was no Matt and no\nLucas B either. So I thought okay I\nshould try to just put a little pressure\non for a couple of kilometers and I\nsplit the group and then we we stay like\neight riders I would say more or less in\nthe front and they was just playing\nalso. I I I wanted to stay behind like\nlast position for also to make the other\nhead getting like shaked out you know a\nlittle bit like pressure. They all knew\nI was strong today, but they couldn't\nsee me. M was just looking behind, you\nknow.\nThey knew the finish was a rise into the\nwindmill and Chad Hager was keeping a\nsteady tempo on the front. The American\nformer world tour road pro.\nBeers, two stage wins to his name.\nBut then we got to the last kilometer. I\nknew it was a kicker. When Ugo went\nearly, it was perfect for me because I\nfirst waited for Lucas and Matt to\nreact, but the reaction was a bit too\nslow and Ugo could get a gap and then I\nhad to go and I had to go catch Hugo and\nthen I could uh still catch him in the\nsteep bit and then I could uh drop him.\n&gt;&gt; The beauty of a blind finish. Shugo Daw\ngoing just a little bit too early and\nhis legs gave in at a critical phase and\nit was a victory for Simon Pillow as he\nstormed to victory at the Blavat burn\ncamp to take the first stage win by the\nSwiss rider.\nSimon Pillow's explosive attack earned\nhim 8 seconds in his battle with Matthew\nBeers at the top of the standings. Lucas\nBound 149 down and Tristan Nokia just\nseparated by 37 seconds. Welcome back\ninto the top 10 for Andrea Sebolt and\nAndre Fishnet.\n&gt;&gt; It's been perfect to play a final for me\ntoday.\n&gt;&gt; Simon Paloo's [music] explosive attack\nearned him an 8second gain against\nMatthew Beers. He's 55 seconds down.\nLucas Bal is 149 [music]\nDuo and Tristan close out the top five.\nWelcome back into the top 10 Andrea\nSeolt and [music] Andre Fishnet.\nFollowing two days of racing, the\npecking order was just about\nestablished. Axel Dwa Prevo with six\nwins this year and a 13-second lead over\nAshiman Pacio. The fourth oldest town in\nSouth Africa, Karafanet bid [music]\nfarewell. The youngsters from Union High\nSchool enjoying an opportunity to bid\nfarewell to them along Kaledan Street as\nthey rolled out behind [music] the\nNetbank gravel burn livery Toyota\nfortune on the neutral stage.\nAshiman Pacio second alongside Haley\nSmith, a rider who's riding herself\nright into contention and she sits in\nfifth place overall.\nOn stage two, she gave evidence that she\nis here in good form and intent on\nmaking an impact on the podium.\nQuiet roll out into the Camdeoo National\nPark.\nSpectacular\nsetting left the Arasmus Kurf and the\nCamboo National Park. Ahead of them was\nthe conical peak climb.\nJanita McKenzie from Port Elizabeth\nriding for Chem Champ [music]\nand she is a midwife by profession and a\nhighly highly credentialed and skilled\nsemi-professional rider. Farra\nCoppenberg back and racing hard at the\nfront of proceedings leading Ashu Mulman\nPacio and setting a wicked pace that\nstrung the group out along the gravel\nroads. Undulations all the way to the\ntop of [music] Conicle Peak at 43 km.\nIt's a traditional riding and those\nclimbs started to have an effect on the\nback of the field as riders started to\ndrop off. Coppenberg,\nDubar Prevo, Mulman Pacio Hotinger, and\nat the back there, Melissa Rollins. It\nwasn't to be for Clara Coppenberg. Her\nefforts at the front came to N. A\npuncture in the rear wheel, and she\nspent precious time as riders rolled\npast her in repairing the puncture. A\nsorry time for the German rider, but she\nis a bold and brave racer. She'll be\nback to race again on stage four.\nMeanwhile, the African champion Haley\nGreen on the home roads setting the pace\nas they rolled through the first of the\ngravel burn putt styles.\nApplauded by the crew there, they\nweren't to stop. They were here for\nbusiness. All looking around wondering\nwho was going to make the first move.\nWell, the course decided that it was a\nsteep, punishing climb winding up\ntowards Chronicle Peak. Not the ultimate\nsummit, but it saw the preeminent\nclimber in the field, Ashley Mulman\nPacio, just flex her muscle and\nillustrate that if anyone's going to get\nher get the better of her, they'd have\nto ride themselves\nalmost to a standstill. Mulman pass\non the French woman's wheel. Behind her,\nHaley Smith looking ever so strong. Also\nin this field, Olivia Hotinger.\nSlowly but surely, riders were dropping\noff. This was a major selection point in\nthe women's elite race. They summited\nConicle Peak\nand then plummeted down. A graphic\nillustration of the wonderful skills\nand talents of these superb athletes.\nRisk and reward balanced precariously.\nThe way they went, eight riders.\nThe one rider who is an unfamiliar\npresence in this elite selection was\nthird wheel here, Lyanna Giggler, the\nAustrian champion, relishing the chance\nto go for a stage win in such exalted\ncompany, which included the American\nchampion, Lauren Stevens, sitting at the\nback of the group there. Melissa Rollins\nhad dropped off the group and she was\nworking hard to regain contact.\nSomething the American did with relative\nease a short while later as she rolled\ninto the back of the group. [music]\nThe selection made surely the stage\nwinner would come from this. Rollins,\nDubois, Prevo, Stevens, Smith, Pin,\nAshiman, Pacio, and Giggler as well as\nHottinger.\nHottinger sitting at the back here as\nHaley Smith, who'd barely been off the\nfront the [music] entire day, continued\nto set a good tempo.\nWelcome water and shade on a day that\nsaw the temperatures rise to the highest\nwe've seen over the first three days of\nthe Netbank gravel burn.\nOn the drag towards the line, it blinked\nin the distance. The windmill was the\nbeacon to which they were racing.\nRollins, Haley Pin, Jana Giggler all had\nhopes of being on the top step of the\npodium today.\n[music] General classification,\nwell, it was just 13 seconds the\ndifference between\nDwa Prevo [music] and Mulman Pacio. And\nthose two riders never left each other\nalone all day. [music]\nThey rolled ever so cautiously\nunderneath the N9. Porsche not due to\nanything other than what came and what\nlay in store. [music] The drag to the\nfinish. So much riding on this. And then\nPin had to stop. Real drama. Haley Pin\noff her bike. The ride the riders go\naway from her and she has to stop dead\nand unwind a long long length of fencing\nwire that entangled itself in her front\nwheel hub. Second day in a row a\nmechanical issue has denied Haley Pin\nfrom being in the mix for the stage win.\nReally, really unfortunate situation for\nthe South African. Surely she'll get it\nright one day this week.\nMulman, Pacio, Stevens, Yuba, Prevo,\nPotinger, all starting to wind it up,\nshadowed by that helicopter. And on the\ndrag towards the finish, the final drag\nto the line. And the first drop was Jana\nGiggler, the Austrian champion, sitting\nright at the back here, figning perhaps\nfatigue, but anything but was Lauren\nStevens, the American champion, jumped\nand attacked, reacting first Haley Smith\nand then Ashley Morman Pacio. But there\nwas no stopping her. She was soaring to\nvictory at Blau Farms and the burn\n[music] camp. Second stage winner, she\nwins stage three.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we were a pretty small group, so I\nstayed towards the back coming in and\nthen just before I went at about 400 m,\nI laid off the group um so I could come\nby them with some speed. Now that we can\nforget about the rain and cold on day\none and we have the nice sunshine, um\nit's been a wonderful experience.\nExcel Dubis Prevo continues to wear the\nAsos Ember leaders jersey by 12 seconds\nfrom Ashiman Pacio. Melissa Rollins 150\ndown a big gap to Haley Pin who lost\ntime due to that mechanical Smith in\nfifth place continues to get stronger.\nSettling into the Netbank gravel burn\nand sage advice from the Olympic\nchampion Tom Pitcock.\n&gt;&gt; I didn't know what to expect, but the\ncamp's super cool, you know, just\nsleeping tents, campfire. We're on the I\nbought marshmallows yesterday. So,\nKevin, next year you should supply\nmarshmallows. The riders welcomed home\nto this Blaua burn camp by the\nenthusiastic and excited\nsupporters\ndeep in the heart of the Karu.\n[cheering]\nRich, the 1988 world race champion was a\npopular target for selfies.\nAfter a hot day, a cool towel to wipe\ndown. It was thumbs up all round. The\noriginal 500 gravel burners settling\ninto a stunning remote burn camp at\nBlava Farms where they could unpack,\nkick back, and enjoy the peace and\ntranquility of the Karu. They'd be here\nfor two nights. Their sense of community\nwas building 3 days in and first day\nstrangers were [music] now firm friends\nwith a common purpose and desire.\nRecovery, refueling,\nall part of the daily routine.\nSpecialized looking after the bikes.\nChecked in to the bike park.\n&gt;&gt; Dusty, a little creaky,\nand very, very shortly under the expert\nguidance of the bikewash crew, they were\nback in pristine condition. For stage\nfour,\nthey'll explore more of the magical,\nmysterious Great Kuru and its conical\ncopies,\nquaint villages, and the unique flora\nand fauna of the region. Compassburg.\nThey will do a loop around the iconic\nmountain.\nNew Bethesda and its magnificent church\nwill be on their route as well.\nA 111 km loop around the magnificent\nCompass Bach. 1450 m of climbing\nincluding the brutal comas and Tarel\nCorp. twice.\nThey're deep into the heart of the Great\nKaru, the gravel burn continues to\nprovide wondrous views, [music]\nexcitement, and plenty of drama.",

        "search_text": "Gravel Burn is a seven-stage, 786-800km gravel race across South Africa featuring extreme terrain variations and challenging conditions. Key obstacles include the brutal Shellot climb with rocks, stones and loose terrain that forces riders to dismount, and the 14km Prince Alfred's Pass climb reaching over 1,000m elevation. Stage one presents muddy, slippery forest sections in wet conditions cold enough to destroy brake pads. The race traverses from coastal forests through the Karu Desert to wildlife reserves, with stages including 80km tarmac sections. Riders face extreme weather from freezing nighttime temperatures that freeze tents and gear to desert heat. The event combines professional racing with a $150,000 prize purse and burn camps featuring communal dining and campfires. Terrain constantly changes making flat stages potentially the hardest, requiring strategic pacing across the week-long effort."
