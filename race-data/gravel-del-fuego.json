Flying to Chile's end for a race that leaves you crying at the start line before the logistics even begin."

Carola Fresno found herself 'alone, which was more than half the race' during her 250km attempt.

Longer than Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

Carola Fresno broke at 'the Milodón sector' facing endless headwinds that 'felt like they were trying to stop me in my tracks.' The terrain demands enough skill that recreational riders hit mental breakdowns at specific geographic landmarks, not just from distance. Similar technical demands to Gravel Worlds."

No elevation profile published, no named climbs, no indication of where the hurt happens. That's moderate climbing with maximum uncertainty about when it hits. Similar elevation profile to Gravel Worlds. As Carola Fresno puts it: \"250 kilometres with 3000 metres of elevation gain in less than 20hrs sounds insane to most people. And maybe it is? But the magic lies in this — that in the end, time doesn't really matter.\""

April in Patagonia means 'pack layers for changes' and potential rain, wind, and sun in the same day. The directors claim it's 'the best time of year to pedal in Patagonia' but that's like being the smartest kid on the short bus. Unpredictable weather in remote terrain with minimal race support is a recipe for suffering. More weather exposure than Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego. As Carola Fresno puts it: \"The headwind at times felt endless, like it was trying to stop me in my tracks. I just wanted to finish.\""

The 1000K route crosses into Tierra del Fuego via the Strait of Magellan ferry, maintaining relatively low elevations throughout. Low enough that altitude sickness isn't mentioned in any rider reports, high enough to provide dramatic Andean and ice field views. Modest altitude compared to Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

The 1000K route literally ends at the bottom of the world in landscapes most humans will never see."

No aid station info, no surface breakdown, no technical briefings beyond 'mandatory bike check.' The organizers promise 'exigente as inolvidable' but won't show you a proper course map.

The 250K has a 20-hour cutoff which suggests they're not filtering for speed demons. This is adventure tourism with timing chips, not competitive racing. Less competitive depth than Almanzo 100."

You're paying for location access, not race production value."

The 1000K finishes in Porvenir with awards in Punta Arenas, requiring additional flights or 3.5-hour bus transfers. Ferry crossings cost extra with 'approximately 30 minutes' crossing time and riders must 'carry money to pay for passenger and bicycle.' End-of-the-world expensive with multiple transportation legs and remote location premiums. More expensive than Atlas Mountain Race."

into my\nconversation with Tito Tito welcome to\nthe\nshow hello I'm super excited to have\nthis conversation it's been a while in\nthe making thank you so much for your\npatience um it required a lot of work on\nmy side but you've been very kind to me\nso thank you for having\nme you had me at Patagonia the moment\nyou said that in your first email I was\nlike I need to find out what Tito is all\nabout and The more I've learned over the\nyears have left left even more excited\nto have this conversation\ntoday yeah Patagonia well is such a\npowerful word uh for all you agree with\nthis um yeah Patagonia is very far south\ndon't you think close to Antarctica\nmaybe indeed I think it's the farthest\nSouth I've ever been and just putting it\nout there to those listening I've been\non a trkking trip in Patagonia which\ncovers the and jump in correct me if I'm\nwrong but the sort of southern area of\nArgentina and Chile is kind of the\nPatagonia region and I had the pleasure\nof seeing some of the most beautiful\nmountains in the world on this track and\nalso some of the longest bus rides I\nfeel like I've ever taken across the\nregion to get from one point to\nanother and windy maybe\nno 100% I think the first day the sort\nof the female guide she was wearing a\nski hat and it was it was not a cold\ntime of year and she was just basically\nlike if you're going to be out in this\nripping wind all day it's just nice to\nhave something covering your ears yeah\nyeah F it's crazy\num I'm a very I want to believe I'm a\nbig fan of history but also yeah I have\na deep connection with the past and I\nthink patagon is powerful because of her\nof the Aesthetics the mountains of\ncourse but the history that surrounds uh\nthe mountains is something that is hard\nto grasp and maybe to find uh but of\ncourse I was born and raised there so I\nwant to believe that I have a deep\nconnection with my land uh and that's\nwhy I'm very excited about this event\nbecause um of course um I want to show\nthe world a different perspective even\neven to myself like I know my region\nclimbing ice skating uh\nskiing but uh but graveling graveling is\na new thing in Chile and even more in\nPatagonia yeah we'll get into it in a\nminute because I know you described the\nSprint loop as being one of the most\nspectacular rides you've ever done but\nbefore we get into the event itself\nlet's just talk a little bit about you\nand your background and how you came to\nthe sport of gravel\ncycling um okay\num okay I began doing montine earing uh\nthere is this guy ulish have you heard\nof him um may he rest in peace ah okay\nyou know the bom Festival wasn't it was\nstill taking takes place in Chile so of\ncourse if you were a rock climber\nfollowing Chris Chris charma you know\nAdam Andra now these days uh and\neventually willtech show up in one of\nthose videos climbing the North Face of\nthe Iger so I was one of those fans and\nI've\nbeen I was talking this with my\ngirlfriend I I think I am very obsessed\nwith going fast and light I never liked\ntrkking really which I've been a trkking\nguide but it was not my thing I was\nalways cutting grams and and stuff\nounces you would say but what I'm trying\nto say is that I got into Mon toering\nthen I understood there was something\ncalled trail running and I became a\nUltra Runner I guess I around Leadville\n100 I did it I got the big bu big Buckle\nI don't know how many hours you have to\ndo it I don't remember the hours um it\nwas the only time I trained in my\nlife\nand oh ult Ultra then I knew it took me\ntoo many\nyears\nI had like a very conventional education\nprivate schools and Catholicism and I\nhad to become an engineer nothing of\nthat worked and it took me many years to\nunderstand that I have like a deep\npassion for Ultra stuff Ultra whatever\nso one person told me that if you had a\nbicycle that could go super far over\n200ks that might be 160 miles so maybe\ntwo months after I bought my first road\nbike I hated it\nbut I just used it and have you heard of\nthis uh concept crack called brevit bre\nthis yeah in fact we just I just had a\nfriend on talking about Perry Russ Paris\nand explaining the bves and and that\nwhole culture you see okay so I did the\n200 the 300 the 400 the 600 case and I I\nended up not liking it it was too easy\nbecause it's just road bikes I'm not\nsaying it's wrong but I'm it was lacking\nto me of a real Adventure because you\nknow it's everything too under\ncontrol and I don't know how gravel\ncycling showed up and I got myself\nanother bike and it was a gravel bike\nand before it was something here in\nChile just before it became something I\nwas already graveling and just exploring\nand and I began doing everything that\nyou were supposed to do with a Mont bike\nI was doing it with the gravel because\nit reminded me more of having like a\nsteel frame when we were kids\nprobably so that's how went and then the\ncommunity began to grow\nand and were you were you living in in\nSantiago at then at this point I believe\nyou grew up in southern Chile but you\nwent to Santiago for college right\nthat's right uh sadly yes college and\nthen I I went back to home and yeah but\nI but I was running a lot so I've been\nrunning a lot a lot and cycling was\nbasically the same thing and graveling\nbecame an explosion just before covid in\nChile just before maybe a year before\ngraveling culture exploded so I took my\nbike to the South um I am from\nPuntarenas very far in Patagonia very\nfar\nsouth and I was just graveling trying to\nunderstand what this was and of course I\nhad the everybody's drama what tire\nwidth uh suspension or\nsuspension bike packing not bike packing\ngravel racing um how errow should I I be\nand yeah but um yeah after and after Co\nI came back to\nSantiago maybe to help people understand\na little bit about what graveling is\nlike in Chile Where did you where did\nyou arrive with your bicycle\nsetup when when when what type of bike\ndid you end up did you buy an arrow bike\ndid you buy a bike packing bike what\nseems to be the best for the type of\nterrain you were\nenjoying well that's going to be a a\ncomp the discussion because um okay I\nhave to give a short perspective of how\ngravel behaves in this lovely country of\nmine uh we know have to we talked about\nthis right Craig um our gravel is not\nlike this thing you get to see in\nUnbound gravel or some other races where\nyou're like flowing and arrow bars and\neverything is so nice and smooth we have\na more aggressive gravel it's more\nrugged uh with more bigger rocks it is\nvery\nsafe but it's just not so fast rolling\nthis concept is different so usually our\ngravel bikes in the in this country we\nhave white tires at least 38 millimeters\n38c at least everybody's now going over\n40s and suspension maybe a might be a\ntopic but you know it makes it more\nexpensive um myself I have an a racing U\nframe because I'm obsessed with grams\nI'm a great winning I'm super great\nwinning my gravel bike must be 7. three\nkilos that's like a pro tour bike AOW\nPro Tour Bike is the same weight as mine\nso but it's but but I have like a super\namazing can I say the brand or no yeah\nsure I have Rene hery Rene HSE yeah I've\ntested all the tires in the world and\nyeah those are like by far the best um\nthey're two you say Supple I think yeah\nabsortion my God they're magical so you\ncan use well that that's just my\npersonal experiment but um going going\nback to the concept um I use a gravel\nracing bike uh not Arrow but ultral\nlight but people prefer to have more\nchunky tires um it's maybe heavier but\nthey focus of course more on on Comfort\nbecause that is the priority in a\ncountry such as\nthis yeah when you when you talk about\nsort of gravel beginning to take off\nkind of just before covid and and then\nthe years afterwards were you finding\nother gravel cyclists were they starting\nto crop up did you find a way to bring\nthat community\ntogether well in Patagonia itself\nno that is the honest the honest truth\nand we were like three guys and it is\ngrowing I will not lie but it's it's\nslow because in places such as Patagonia\nwhere the weather is very unpredictable\nmountain biking makes more sense and\npeople were doing mountain biking on\ngravel you know so now it's a matter of\nyou know the the concept has to\npenetrate um over the the community\nSantiago is faster everything goes\nfaster because you know Santiago is a\ncapital of I don't know anymore 10\nmillion people so that means there's\njust too much going on events of course\nit's just everything takes place here\nand then it spreads uh all over the\ncountry\nso I think something fascinating is not\nreally connected to this podcast but\nChile is one of the most connected\npeople uh to cell phones in the world\nlike whatever you do if you show on\nInstagram people will know you can maybe\nyou will be on tv nobody will see you\nbut on Instagram so I guess we are more\nconnected through through social media\nso I can tell you how much it's growing\nmaybe in Santiago and slower in the rest\nof the country but it is growing but the\nrates are different the closer you are\nto the capital of course it's\nfaster yeah and then at some point you\ngot the bright idea to put on your first\nevent and that was closer to Santiago\nright\nvery close like two hours and a half and\nit was not done in Santiago because we\ndon't really have real gravel in\nSantiago so we thought okay where's the\nclosest place for real gravel and it's\nlike yeah it's in a place called Navidad\nthe we're separated in regions and those\nregions are separated in\nmunicipalities I don't know if that the\nword y yep in the municipality of\nNavidad is where we take place because\nwe thought it was one of the best\ngravels we have found in their T country\nreally but it was not myself it was um\ntwo friends of mine um that Juan and\nLuis he was just here and we are\npartners and friends um and we invented\nthis crazy race called gravel Coast that\nwas our first event almost four years\nago and what what's the gravel Coast\nevent\nlike well we call it we invented it\nsomehow inspired in Unbound and what's\nhappening in the north am in North\nAmerica we feel very connected\nespecially my friend luchon Luis luchon\nlikes he knows all the athletes of your\ncountry what's happening there what's\nhappening with the bikes he likes the\ntechnology and everything so and I also\nfeel very connected with many events\nover there because of Lifetime company\nyou know it's yeah you know they they\nthey have some understanding about\nmarketing so it hits all the way down\nhere so we we try to make an an let's\nsay an adaptation of of what you are\nwhat these people are building over\nthere and maybe adapted to our reality\nbecause we don't have this once again\neven though it's a great gravel quality\nit's not like a super fast\nrolling concept it is\nmore it it is an it is a real challenge\nto finish a gravel Coast race don't get\nme wrong anything can do it I mean many\npeople but you have to you have to be\nprepared I mean our 200 miles are just\ninsane you know this there's too much\nclimbing so that means you're going to\nbe on the on the saddle a bunch of\nhours you're going to be proud of\nfinishing gravel Coast that's what we\nsay and is it is it a 200 mile event the\ngravel\nCoast we have last year we had 70\nkund I forgot my member is so weak but\n120k a 240k and a 320 Cas which is a\nwhich is at 200 miles now for the final\nevent that is taking next year that is\n20 24 is in October that is our\nspring um it's going to be um 50 miles\n100 miles and 200 miles gotcha gotcha\nnow let's talk about the event you're\ngoing to be kicking off in\n2024 what inspired you yeah the big one\nwhat what inspired you to take the\nmantle and create this event yourself\nwhat inspired you of where you're\nplacing it I have so many questions\nabout gravel do Fuego\noh I really love my\ncountry especially Patagonia\num it's hard to explain but okay I'm I'm\na super lucky person because my father\ntaught me how to fish hunt and some\nscuba diving and TI Fuego Island it is a\nplace that everybody wishes to see but\nthere is no development there is no\nthere's not many unless you're like a\nperson who likes fly fishing and can pay\non a helicopter that is the only way\nmaybe you can access to the island now\nit's getting more popular but 20 years\nago I mean if you were not a GAO you\nknow these people that take care of\ntheir cattle over there or if you were\nnot like a fisherman or maybe crazy guy\nyou had no idea what I mean you you knew\nwhat the island was but no way you will\ndare to dive into it I think that thing\nis still still happening\nbut I am so lucky I know the island\nbecause of my father he took me fly\nfishing all the time I with a truck\ndon't get me wrong not on a helicopter\nand we will just you know get into drier\nrivers and he will bring his boat and we\nwill just try to catch some Salmons and\ntrouts and so I had that first approach\nand I saw the island just like that but\nthen I ended up being working for a king\npenguin Colony I mean not for the\nPenguins themselves but from the owner\nof the of the\npark and and I began to understand it\nwas tourism this was like this was the\nreal future of the\nislands and then I ended up working for\nsome company of the government for a\ncommercial I can show it to you on\nYouTube I look very pathetic and believe\nit or not I was the model they called me\nand I was like have you seen pictures of\nme I'm not a model I'm not they were\nlike no but we need somebody at\nventurous blah blah blah so I saw once\nagain the entire island with this\ntourism Vision time passed\nand it took me like three years to\nlaunch this race I was not daring I was\nwondering if I had the experience but\nafter all the events we done these days\nI mean accumulated until today it gave\nus the guts to okay now we now we have\nthe capacity I have the understanding\nI've been in races where people have\nbeen in trouble in Patagonia so I saw\nwhat was wrong so I was able to\nunderstand how I can provide some safety\nissues to secure people to enjoy the\nexperience and not to be you know\ntraumatized um so it's been a long\nprocess I don't know if that responds to\nanswers the question but um it was maybe\na luck a matter of luck of having one\nvision and then to have a more modern\nvision of how tourism come dive into the\nisland and show it to the world yeah I\nthink it's a fairly common kind of\nexpression from race organizers that\nthey've just been somewhere where they\nwant other people to see and\na very small number of you out there in\nthe world take it upon yourself to map\nsomething to organize something to bring\npeople together so I'm always super\nexcited and I was bemused by the\ndistance of your Sprint event your\nSprint is 252\nkilometers which is only a Sprint in\nrelative to the granddaddy event which\nis how many kilometers for the full full\nevent uh I actually I did the conversion\num okay the Sprint is 150 miles I know\nit's a Sprint it's an irony it's an\nirony and then that we have the big uh\nuh route that is a th000 case that is\nroughly\n6504 miles 600 654 miles yeah okay so\nlet's let's talk about them quickly\nindependently of one another and let's\nstart off with the Sprint event of\nroughly 150 miles can you just sort of\nwalk us through what the vision was and\nI believe you were telling me earlier\nthis was the loop that really was\nmagical in your mind if if you were\ngoing to do any one thing do it for one\n24-hour period this is the loop you\nwould want to share with the world so\nlet's talk about\nit well I have to I have to confess um I\nhave to confess that everything B was\nborn fromo I one of the obsessions I\nlike to do is I like to do things that\npeople have not done ever because it's\nmore adventurous when something is done\nand you're trying to break the record\nyou have one warranty which is you can\nmake it because it it is already done\nbut when something has never been done\nthere is more mystery there's more\nuncertainty and I crossed the island\nfrom the north to the south in gravel\nracing non-sleeping mode for the first\ntime ever and back then I was already\nbuilding the idea of making a race but I\nwasn't\nsure and then the the upper section of\nthe entire race I speak of the 600 miles\nrace I've done it many times driving\nbecause I was a guide and also I was\nhunting with my father in some sections\ntoo uh Birds um when I say hi hunting\nwhatever I killed I ate it so please\ndon't be upset people um having said\nthat\num what was the question sorry well I\nwanted to talk through both of the the\ndistances and sort of the vision and\nstarting with the Sprint Loop like what\nis what what would Riders be\nexperiencing yeah okay my apologies uh\nthe the short Loop was kind of logical\nbecause it it\nis it enters the the famous Park\nNational Park uh called Tores Del Pine\nTores Alpine are these Granite Towers um\nthat are super insane these spikes with\nare Elevate thousands of meters up the\nsky quick quick aside I literally have a\npicture of the mountains you're\ndescribing in my kitchen you see Pro\nsomething yeah it's amazing right um so\num sadly because of a matter of\nlogistics we cannot make it shorter uh\nwe will have to bring people to I don't\nknow closer to the mountains but that\nmean would mean to move the people and\ntheir bikes and that is just impossible\nso Chile is a very expensive country so\nsorry that's the best we can do and what\nyou're going to see is that I mean from\nthe mile 60 you get to see the towers\nright away uh the videos are are on the\nInstagram of gravel Del fuo\nthat is the name of the race and yeah I\nmean as you are peddling Craig you're\njust looking at the towers from one\nangle then you get to see more of the\nthree towers because there are three\ntowers uh and then one of the towers\nhides and then you just get to see two\nbut then you see this called mountain\ncalled aliro which is full of glaciers\nand then you get to see the entire faces\nof the of this of these guys I mean I'm\nsorry of the aliro you leave away aliro\nand then you see the horns Los quos the\nhorns of of the P which are this Granite\nonce again towers that on top they have\nvolcanic material which is the black\ndots on top of them and that is amazing\nlike I just today I just put some\nstories on the Instagram how beautiful\nthey are and then you final finish\nfinish with the final Peak the highest\none which is called Pine Grande Big Pine\nthat it has a huge plateau of of just\nglaciers um I'm sorry I get excited but\nI don't know if that so that is the\npoint of the Sprint I know it's not a\nSprint of course but we made it\navailable for all people because they\nhave 20 hours to finish the race that is\na lot of hours you can contemplate you\ncan stop you can eat and but it's just I\ndon't know I wish people I I guess I\nhave to invite them to get into the\nwebsite and see the pictures like we\nwent on April so people would see how\nthe landscape is going to look for them\nit's just amazing I mean contemplating\nmountains Asal cannot be any better\ndon't you think yeah no I agree and your\nenthusiasm is absolutely warranted and I\nencourage everybody to follow graval\nfego on Instagram and go to the website\nyou'll see the pictures you'll see what\nwe're talking about and you'll see that\neven the most monotone individual cannot\nhelp but be effusive about how beautiful\nthat region is when you think about that\nLoop and you think about the Riders they\nhave 20 hours you know inevitably\nthere'll be some person some people who\nare RAC ing it what do you think one can\nget around the loop in with 20 hours\nbeing the maximum what do you think sort\nof the minimum winning race time might\nbe that's a big one um well I already\nhave my Cardon one possible\nwinner his name is I'm gonna say him\nbecause he saw the race when I invented\nthe race he was the first guy who saw\nthe circuit the the final circuit some\nother friends helped me I have to name\nhim he because he's a very great\ninspiration for Ultra Community his name\nis canuto rasis we've done some crazy\nstuff together actually we did the\neveresting road cycling together and\nnext week Andre stag the uh maybe the\nbest graer we have in the country he saw\nthe circuit I mean next next week he did\nthe everesting since then we became\nfriends and he saw the grav fuo concept\nand he was like Tito I'm so in this is\nthe best ra the best race ever let's do\nit he he will not do the Sprint I think\nhe will go for the thousand but if\nsomebody of that caliber will go he can\nmake the race in nothing I don't know I\nwould have to do the math but it would\nbe 23k I can let me do it real quick but\npeople that are very fast and it's legal\nto draft so they can do it very quick um\nyeah they can do it\nunder I don't know seven\nhours if not less Andre is detonated we\nsay in Spanish Andre is detonated his\nreaching levels that he's going probably\nI'm guessing he's going to Unbound and\nhe's going for something big um let's\npray for him yeah interesting we'll have\nto keep our eyes open for him yeah and\nthen the the\num the thk event totally different you\nknow ball game you're you're talking\nabout six and a half days yes to\ncomplete it on on the outside talk a\nlittle bit about that experience you\nmentioned earlier that it goes down into\num toal del Fuego so you you'll do this\nsame loop as the Sprint but also head\nway down to the very very southern tip\nright yes that's right allow me to say\njust a little thing because when people\nhear Patagonia they hear they think wind\nwind and then they think rain\nrain and this is very important Craig uh\nwe did the racing on April which that is\nAutumn is fall it's not Summer and the\nquestion is why don't you do it in\nsummer I mean it's warmer the answer is\nyes\nbut yes it's warmer but the wind is way\nstronger in our spring and our summer\nway more so that's why people think of\nwinds because they come in the High\nseason when when they think it's better\nbut the thing is in Fall the amount of\nwind is way less it's way less like I\ndon't know way slower I'm saying 80% the\nmax wind speed you get to have in summer\nuh you have only 20% that speed in April\nand the same happens with the rains when\nit rains it rains a lot in summer but if\nit does in April it could be more like a\nshower So eventually you just can keep\npedaling but it's it is colder of course\nit is colder but it's not extreme cold\nso it's what and the other and finally\nit's the landscape because patagon is\ngreat but sadly what people don't know\nand I guess I don't know if it's sad or\nnot but what I'm trying to share is the\nmost beautiful contrasts of colors you\nget to have them in in April because\nit's fall so so the the trees are orange\nso you have the glaciers that are\nalready and then you have the high\nmountains already with snow because it's\nfreezing on top of them but you get to\nhave this contrast of these trees with\ngreen and the farther you go south is\norange and that's why and and and\nfinally we did the circuit in a way\nwhere if there is wind it's going to be\non your tail that's why it goes from\nnorth to south I was going to ask you\nthat cu the coast of California is the\nsame way it can have a ripping wind but\nyou know N9 days out of 10 it's always\ngoing to be from the north to the South\nexactly the same here I mean I'm\nspeaking from a point of view of\nmathematics something some this is\nPatagonia everything is unpredictable\nsometimes of course we can have great\nwind but if it does once again it should\nbe on your tail not on your not in your\nhead which is awful so yeah yeah that is\nvery very important to be mention\nbecause there is an explanation for\nchoosing not summer right exactly so\nthis this\num thk course also has a pretty\nsignificant amount of climbing so you're\nobviously picking some of that up in the\nin the first Sprint Loop but then as you\ngo\nsouth are you going over large mountain\npeaks along the way no it's very\nfascinating because when you go to tesp\narea as as we talked you get to see the\nmountains but then you go south and it's\nfascinating because eventually when you\ngo south then you're going to go east\nfollowing the extreme border of\nArgentina technically in many places\nyou're going to look to your left and\nthat is going to be Argentina itself\nlike you you can literally cross\nillegally to\nArgentina um not that I have done it uh\nbut uh it's fascinating I promise you\nand that area is so flat it's so flat\nit's I have pictures posted already and\nit's I've never seen something like that\nnot on gravel like infinite flatness of\na straight road for miles for Miles I\npromise you\nand then you go south once again and\nthen you are as as long as you're going\nmore and more south you're somehow\napproaching a mountain range which is\nnot famous is called Darwin mountain\nrange that is just before the ocean that\ntouches the the Antarctica the farther\nyou go south you get to climb but um but\nit's very graveling rolling very decent\npace most of the circuit and when I say\nthis I'm saying of\n70% of the circuit the rest of it at\nespecially at the end very very end you\nget to have mountains for real and\nthey're beautiful but it's the final\nchallenge that's right how do you\nimagine cyclists approaching the 1K in\nterms of where will they be sleeping\nwhat what does that end up looking like\nthat's a good question\num what what we did is in the website we\ncreated something called I don't know in\nEnglish but it's like a it's like\num we call it the guide of the race and\nwe put every single campaign hostel\nhotel where you can sleep so you somehow\nyou can make a schedule of where you're\ngoing to sleep where you're going to go\nso or maybe as you are writing you can\narrange a a beted for you to be waiting\nto be waiting for you um I think I'm\npretty sure it's something like not many\nraces of this distance have and we're\nvery proud of it because you can somehow\nbe more safe because in other race is\nlike from point A from point B follow\nthe circuit good luck see you soon and\nyou have you have to fix it for yourself\nto keep more safety for the people we\ndid so so I can tell you and actually we\nhave 12 checkpoints many races of this\ndistance they have only I don't know two\nthree by aeral five checkpoints we have\n12 and most of them they're hotels hosts\nso if you're tempted to for a hot shower\nyou'll have it if you don't have money\nor you don't want to spend money many of\nthem they have like a place for you to\nput a set a tent I have friends that\nthey're coming like this that crazy um\nmore sacrificed style um but also if\nyou're graveling and you want to crush\nit um you can program very well many\nplaces to stay even though there's not\nmany much traffic not many cars moving\nalong the circuit just ourselves um when\nI say ourselves the the organizers where\nwe have eight vehicles for safety um\njust moving around\num there are many places where you can\nbe sleeping you're not going to be so so\nabandoned in the nothingness of the\nPatagonia and will will the same uh\nwould you make the same comment about\nthe ability to resupply with food and\nwater um for the 250 Cas they're very\nsafe in actually the the the big loop\nalso I mean the big circuit because the\nfour the first four checkpoints they\nwill have water isotonic and some fruits\nso that will make it for most of it I\nmean especially for the Sprint but for\nthe rest of the guys uh I have arranged\na few spots\nwhere uh where they can buy food uh and\nmany places as I said they have they\nhave hostels hotels and nice people that\nthey want to be involved with the\ncommunity in this uh event I have seen\nthem a few a few times making sure that\nit will be open and many of them are\njust waiting these people like and so\nyeah they will find food but of course\nthe Thousand Cas have to be a little\nmore careful you know the type of\nnutrition they require is different the\namount of calories uh but it's all\nmostly settled\nyeah gotcha and it looks like at some\npoint you have to cross a Waterway is\nthere a ferry that the Riders will be\ntaking that's right um yeah I'm very\nexcited about it because that requires\nLogistics from the point of view of the\nthe athletes right um I've done the math\nand the and most the winners uh they\nshall not have to wait for the ferry to\nI mean here's the thing the ferry works\nfrom I don't remember I think from 8 in\nthe morning until 23 p.m. 23 hours that\nso that's a huge gap but that doesn't\nguarantee everybody will cross so first\nof all just before the ferry 20 16 miles\nbefore the ferry maybe there is a a town\nthat I already have talked many have had\nmany meetings with them they're going to\nsupply us uh like a gymnasium where they\nhave PS and everything for emergency if\npeople want to stay if people want to\npay for more Comfort that's no problem\num but I would say like the 40 maybe\nmore maybe 55% 40% of the strongest of\nthe racers will make it without waiting\nfor the ferry because this Ferry is\nCrossing from the continent to the\nisland um every 30 minutes maybe an hour\nat at the most it's a 20 M minutes cross\nit's beautiful because you're Crossing\nwhat is called the maganic straight\nbefore the Panama channel the only way\nyou can make it to the other\nside right I think it was discovered in\n15 that was the farthest I ever made it\nI made it to the side of The Straits of\nmellin on the Northern side to look at\nthe straight but I didn't make it across\nyou see yeah so I'm not lying you see um\nso yeah I think there's like a dip\nsymbolism in it because it also brings\nAdventure it brings more more of a\nchallenge but also so maybe once again\nmaybe you want to take it slow I have we\nhave people from Spain and they want to\ntake it slow they want to take the six\ndays and a half and they want to sleep\njust before the ferry because they they\njust want to see everything on daylight\nso everything has been done like\nthinking of that like grab a Racers but\nthey don't want to wait for the ferry\nthey just want to get to the other side\nas fast as possible I think it we are\ngoing to manage that slower people can\nmake it to the other side without\nwaiting yes some others will be forced\nto be waiting of course I mean there is\na schedule but I think I want to believe\nwell perfect you mentioned those final\nmountains I think they were the mellin\nmountains are they on Tira Delo yeah no\nbut they the Darwin mountain range we as\nyou're getting close by yeah that's all\nright um so many names it's like there's\nno way I know all the mountains in your\ncountry no wor no worries um the\nDarkwing mountain range as I said yes\nyou're getting so close to them that\nthat's why you have this um this we call\nthem paks um and it's funny because in\nbetween before every climb there is a\nlagoon on not a lagoon um how do you say\na lake on the other side and they're\nvery famous for fly fishing actually my\nfather walked to the first Lake it took\nhim three days to get there because\nthere was no road before you had to go\nno GPS like it's crazy I have pictures\nof my father climbing those mountains\nthat now you can go go on a bicycle in a\nsuper Safe Way um but yeah it's\nbeautiful I mean the last 300 Cas I mean\neverything has its beauty right um Tores\nAlpine National Park it's mind-blowing\nthere no words you have to see it until\nyou see it and then you see and then you\nunderstand and it's going to be in your\nheart forever then you deal with the\nPampa which is the Steep you say in\nEnglish with this this total flatness\nthat drives you crazy but it's like\nsuper graveling fast rolling uh there is\na video where I'm pedaling I know 20\nsomething miles per hour on Arrow mode\nlike flying over the the course and then\nyou have some section of the\nPuma and the the final 200\nmiles are are just too impressive it's\ntoo beautiful because then you get to\ndive yourself into the into the forest\nand there are some sections where just\nyou're in caves covering this beautiful\num I don't know it's hard to say it in\nEnglish um because I I do believe this I\ndo feel this race\nis I don't know for me here's the point\nCraig uh if you do a race from one point\nfor point a point B it can be an\nexperience right but I want to\nbelieve that Ultra cycling any Ultra\nthing we\ndo there is an opportunity to know\nyourself and one of the best ways to\nknow yourself is to be di like\nsuper dived into the nature like like in\nimmersed do you know what I'm saying\nlike when you when people say like\nthere's some moments in life where you\nfeel you are aware that you are you but\nalso you are somehow\naware this is going to be too romantic\nbut you can be aware of the leaves you\ncan be aware of the dirt you can be\naware of the of the water and somehow\nyou really feel part of everything I\nwant to believe this race can give you\nthat especially in the beginning and at\nthe bottom of the race I I love it Tito\nthat was was perfect and I I totally\nagree with you there's something that\nthat's sort of transcendent when you're\non the bike for multiple days in a row\nwhether it's as simple as bicycle\ntouring or as adventurous as an event\nlike this you just become closer to\nNature than you ever could on a on a day\nb day long bike ride I'm into to that\nyes so Tito at the very end of this race\nyou're quite far away from where you\nstarted what happens at the\nend uh well I have to extract people\nhere's the thing um remember we spoke\nabout the wind and everything we could\nmake the race somehow to make you for\nyou to return by yourself pedaling from\nthe south to the north but as we talked\nbefore the wind comes from the north\nfrom the Northwest so that means\nprobably the wind is going to be in your\nhead and even though it's um slower less\npowerful compared to the summer uh we\nare taking everybody about ourselves you\nget to the Finish Line there is a a sign\nthat says end of the road it's very very\nperfect and we're going to set up tents\nand every time we gather four people we\nget them on a on a vehicle on a pickup\ntruck and we have to drive them we have\nto extract them from the islands to the\nmain city which is called pvir where my\nmother was born\num and yeah and uh that's how then they\ncan take another Ferry this is another\nFerry because there are two axess uh\nthrough the island a small ferry that is\nin the race but then there is a longer\none which is like an hour and half on\nthis ferry to get where you get to the\ncapital of the region that is\nPuntarenas okay um so but it's a long I\nmean we have to drive them like I don't\nknow from this from the Finish to the\ncity pvir must be po almost four hours\nand before that we F we drop them to the\nin the city we give them as a gift the\nuh the I don't know the gift I guess I'm\nsorry we give them the access to see the\npenguin remember I told you we work in I\nwork in the king penguin protected area\nOkay um we already talked to the owners\num to the people over there and the\nmoney of the entrance for the pink king\npenguin is goes directly into the\nprotection of these King Penguins and\nand participants can see them directly\nas a gift that that's so much fun tell\ntell us again when when is the event\nhappening what's the event date April\n13th all the way 20 20th a bunch of this\nyeah and when the listeners of this\npodcast want to book their tickets and\ncome to the event how do you how do you\nget there do you fly into Santiago and\nthen fly south yeah for example in your\ncase like anybody everybody's case um\nsituation they have to fly to Santiago\nwell said uh to the capital of the\ncountry that's Santiago of Chile and\nfrom Santiago of Chile there are too\nmany flights uh all the way my\nrecommendation will be to fly to\nPuntarenas uh Punta Arenas which mean it\nmeans Sunday Point um pun Arenas is\npuq um if you want to look for the\nairport and there are buses all the time\ngoing to Puerto natales where the race\nreally starts um it's for a small fee\nmust be like well with the bike might be\n10,000 chil pesos which is I don't know\n$14 um but yeah my recommendation would\nbe to fly to Santiago Santiago penas FAS\nabas which is three hours bus from PTO\nnales it's crazy I feel like that's part\nof it's part of the Patagonian\nexperience spending some time on a bus\nif you want to see the beautiness and\nthe loneliness of everything yeah that's\nhow it is it is a real\nAdventure amazing amazing Tito thank you\nso much for coming on and telling us\nabout gravel del Fuego I hope the event\nis a big success I know from experience\nthe region is absolutely stunning and\nit's amazing that you've taken the time\nto put this route together and I can't\nwait for gravel cyclists all around the\nworld to come and experience this region\nthank you for your time Craig um I want\nto put this uh record it you're welcome\nuh if you want to come to the race just\num let's see if you are crazy and want\nto have this crazy adventure with me and\nexperience the Patagonia one more time\non two wheels um it will be an honor I\ndo mean it I mean I listen to your\npodcast I mean it will be an honor so\nyeah I want you I would I would love\nthat and appreciate it
