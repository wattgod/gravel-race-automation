        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "This race barely exists in the gravel consciousness — research turns up French events with similar names but nothing concrete for this Belgian version. No notable winners, no pro field, no YouTube coverage worth mentioning. It's riding on the Flanders name without earning the reputation."
      },
      "race_quality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Hard to judge quality when basic race details are a mystery. The 65-mile distance with 3500 feet suggests decent planning, but without confirmed aid stations, cutoff times, or even verified course details, you're gambling on execution. Similar events like Flandres Charentaises deliver 'classiques à l'ancienne' but this one's still proving itself."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Belgium knows how to do cycling culture, even if this particular race is flying under the radar. The Flanders region delivers authentic cobbled roads and that 'esprit du tour des Flandres' atmosphere that nearby events promise. You'll get the real Belgian cycling vibe, just without the crowds or fanfare."
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Belgian cycling communities are tight-knit and welcoming by default — it's cultural DNA. While this specific race lacks the 'ambiance légendaire' that established events boast, you're still tapping into a region where every local understands suffering on two wheels. Smaller field probably means better camaraderie anyway."
      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "With a field of 200-400 riders, no data on field size or competitive depth, which tells you everything. Established events like La Breizh'Flandrienne show hundreds of participants across distance options, but this race isn't drawing those numbers yet. You're looking at enthusiasts and locals, not serious competition. Less competitive depth than Almanzo 100."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Belgian races typically run cheap — similar French events charge €7-€14, so you're probably looking at reasonable entry fees. The 65-mile distance gives you proper bang for your buck without the premium pricing of famous classics. Good value if the race actually delivers what it promises."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Registration runs €60-100. Belgium isn't budget cycling territory — accommodation and food costs add up fast in Flanders. No confirmed lodging strategy or parking details means you're figuring out logistics yourself. European travel expenses hit hard, especially when the race infrastructure isn't clearly established to help you navigate efficiently. Higher total cost than Badlands."
      },
      "length": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "65 miles hits the sweet spot — long enough to hurt, short enough to finish strong. It's comparable to the 60km/100km options that established Flandres events offer. Not an epic sufferfest, not a casual spin, just proper gravel distance that respects your time. Similar distance to Crusher in the Tushar."
      },
      "technicality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "3500 feet over 65 miles suggests rolling terrain rather than technical punishment. Belgium's Flanders region offers cobbles and farm roads but nothing approaching mountain bike difficulty. You'll get some 'gripets' style steep sections but this isn't a technical skills test. Less technical than The Mid South."
      },
      "elevation": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "3500 feet over 65 miles averages out to gentle rolling — way less demanding than events posting 1100m over 100km. Belgium's highest point is under 700 meters, so you're dealing with punchy climbs rather than sustained suffering. Decent workout, not a mountainous beatdown. Less climbing than The Mid South."
      },
      "climate": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Historical weather data shows average highs of 70°F and lows of 54°F, with a 48% chance of rain on any given day, and gusts reaching 27 mph. Belgium serves up proper cycling weather — cool, often damp, occasionally brutal. You'll get that authentic Northern European gravel experience without extreme heat or altitude complications. Weather adds character rather than creating dangerous conditions, assuming you dress for Belgian unpredictability. Similar climate challenges to SBT GRVL."
      },
      "altitude": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Belgium is basically sea level with delusions of grandeur. The entire country peaks under 700 meters, so altitude impact is nonexistent. Your lungs won't notice the difference, your legs will do all the complaining. Lower altitude than Gravel Worlds — no thin-air concerns."
      },
      "logistics": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Belgium is compact and well-connected — airports, trains, roads all function properly. Flanders region has solid infrastructure even if this specific race hasn't published detailed logistics. The country is small enough that you can't really get lost for long, unlike trying to navigate rural France."
      },
      "adventure": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "This feels more like regional cycling tourism than adventure. Belgium's countryside is pleasant but predictable — you're not discovering hidden gems or tackling unknown terrain. It's solid gravel riding through familiar European landscapes without the edge that makes races memorable."
