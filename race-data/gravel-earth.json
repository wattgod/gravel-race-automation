More technical than Life Time events but not extreme MTB."

      "climate": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Variable and challenging across the circuit. Iceland's 10C with horizontal rain and sudden weather changes. Kenya's intense heat on open plains with flash storms.

      "logistics": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Global circuit requires significant travel planning. Kenya needs visa, vaccinations, and included concierge services for a reason. Iceland is remote.

        "explanation": "Klassmark runs professional events with good organization, though the 2024 Traka weather cancellation and 2026 calendar controversies (Ranxo scheduled week after Unbound, Cuckoo Gravel drama) have raised concerns. 'It felt human. It felt independent' is the vibe—not Life Time production polish, but authentic and competent."

        "explanation": "Unforgettable across the series. 'The most scenic gravel I've ever ridden' (The Traka). Riding through Kenya with wildlife encounters is life-changing.

        "explanation": "GES maintains a strong community feel despite going global. 'It felt like ours. Built on passion.' Strong YouTube storytelling and genuine engagement.

        "explanation": "Attracts top European gravel talent and growing international presence. Champions include serious competitors from Canyon Factory Racing and PAS Racing. The Traka draws ~800 riders including world-class racers. However, Life Time's $590,000 purse versus GES's EUR 37,500 means top American pros often skip GES for LTGP. Competitive but not quite elite-complete."

        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Entry fees are reasonable (EUR 60+ for individual events), and the experience-to-cost ratio is strong for adventure-seekers. However, the global travel requirements add up fast. Tour packages help but add cost. The EUR 37,500 total prize purse is dwarfed by Life Time's $590,000. Value exists, but it's adventure value, not financial value."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Multi-continent racing is expensive. Kenya requires flights to Nairobi, domestic flights, premium accommodation packages (included but priced accordingly), visa, and specialized insurance. Iceland is notoriously expensive. Even Spain adds Barcelona flights plus accommodation during peak Girona cycling season. Full series participation is a significant financial commitment—'jet lag just looking at the calendar.'"

Where Life Time offers production polish and prize money, GES offers riding with giraffes in Kenya, volcanic rifts in Iceland, and Mediterranean forests in Girona. It's 'more of an experience than a competition,' as founder Cristina Freixes puts it. The 2026 consolidation (from 23 to 12 events) and calendar controversies suggest growing pains, but the core experience remains world-class.",

      "reality": "Life Time offers $590,000 in prize money for 2026. Gravel Earth offers EUR 37,500. That's not a gap—that's a chasm. 'I feel like we are going to see Life Time eat Gravel Earth Series' lunch as the wealth gap increases,' one pro noted bluntly. Meanwhile, the 2026 calendar consolidation raised eyebrows: The Rift (Iceland) was dropped after Klassmark announced Cuckoo Iceland in the same region two weeks prior—the organizer reportedly found out 'weeks before.' Ranxo Gravel is now scheduled just eight days after Unbound. Five of 13 races are now Klassmark-operated directly. The independent, community-first ethos is facing real pressure.",
      "consequences": [
        "Top American pros will increasingly choose Life Time over GES",
        "Calendar conflicts force riders to choose between events",
        "Klassmark consolidation may reduce event diversity",
        "20% completion rate at Migration reflects genuine brutality"
      ],
      "expectation_reset": "GES is not competing with Life Time for prize money—don't pretend it is. Come for the adventure and experience, not the payout. The 2026 season will test whether consolidation strengthens or weakens the series identity. Migration's 20% completion rate means you're as likely to DNF as finish. And that flight from Kenya to Iceland to Oregon really does give you jet lag just reading the schedule."
