Meanwhile, the 2026 calendar consolidation raised eyebrows: The Rift (Iceland) was dropped after Klassmark announced Cuckoo Iceland in the same region two weeks prior—the organizer reportedly found out 'weeks before.' Ranxo Gravel is now scheduled just eight days after Unbound. Five of 13 races are now Klassmark-operated directly. The independent, community-first ethos is facing real pressure.",
