        "explanation": "KHS91 notes French gravel events often use MTB trails making them rougher than US equivalents, arriving \"a bit broken from the jarring of the course\" in previous years. Multiple airport options within 2 hours help, but medical certificate requirements and FFC health module validity periods add bureaucratic complexity for international riders."
      },
      "length": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "KHS91 demonstrates solid pacing strategy: \"from the start I hold the rhythm that I'm starting to master and that I know I can hold and even accelerate until the end.\" When tempted to follow a fast rider post-CP2, he notes \"I'm at 200W, it's not reasonable, I let him go\" - showing the distance teaches disciplined power management. Similar distance to Crusher in the Tushar."
      },
      "technicality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "The Ultra route includes a chain-pulled ferry crossing over the Sarthe River where \"riders pull themselves across on a chain,\" plus long climbs in the Alpes Mancelles including the Belvédère de Perseigne. KHS91's upgrade to a Fox 32 TC suspension fork eliminated vibrations, suggesting the course demands more than typical gravel smoothness. Less technical than The Mid South."
      },
      "elevation": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "The section between CP1 and CP2 through the Perche and Alpes Mancelles features \"long climbs including the Belvédère de Perseigne\" according to KHS91. Post-Le Mans terrain offers \"beautiful rolling paths\" with \"valley and hillside landscapes,\" while the first 150km presents no notable difficulties - suggesting climbing is back-loaded. Less climbing than The Mid South."

      "climate": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "2025 conditions were cold and wet with \"no more than 12°C outside\" during the day and night temperatures requiring thermal gear. KHS91 appreciated hot soup at checkpoints: \"it feels good to eat hot and always the delicious vermicelli soup that every year gives me back so much strength\" in the grey, humid conditions. Similar climate challenges to SBT GRVL."
      },
      "altitude": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Starting from Meudon near Paris and finishing in Châtellerault puts the entire route in low-elevation western France. No altitude considerations mentioned anywhere in rider reports, confirming this races at near sea level throughout with zero acclimatization concerns. Lower altitude than Gravel Worlds — no thin-air concerns."
      },
      "adventure": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "The Ultra route passes iconic Loire châteaux including Chambord and Amboise, circles medieval Loches, and traverses the Brenne natural park. However, KHS91's mechanical near Versailles required finding \"a bike shop to replace the tire\" - suggesting much of the route stays within reach of civilization rather than remote wilderness."
      },
      "prestige": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "The 2025 edition hosted the inaugural FFC French Gravel Championships, and 3bikes.fr noted it's becoming \"very well known.\" Trans Continental Race winner Victor Bosoni participated, but the event is still establishing its reputation in the growing French gravel scene rather than commanding international attention."
      },
      "race_quality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "The course has evolved each year - 400km initially, 500km in 2024, 540km in 2025 with added Alpes Mancelles loop. While KHS91 praises \"organization always at the top,\" the constant distance changes and route modifications suggest the event is still finding its optimal format rather than perfecting an established blueprint."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Three-day festival format with multiple distances from 80km to 150km gives you options beyond just suffering once. Free guarded bike parking and luggage storage shows they're thinking about the details that matter. The podiums at La Manu in Châtellerault from 2:30pm onward suggest they're building something resembling a proper finish experience, even if the race itself lacks character."
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Multiple distance options from 50km to 500km create \"a gravel festival for everyone\" with food trucks and free entertainment. Non-FFC members can participate in championships and be ranked even if ineligible for podiums. KHS91 repeatedly emphasizes the exceptional care from race director Savignoni's team as his reason for returning each year."
      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "2024 sub-24 hour finishers included Fabien Duffossé (23:04) and Sébastien Botte (23:17), while 2025 saw Trans Continental Race winner Victor Bosoni participate. However, KHS91 observed many riders starting too fast due to \"probably a lack of experience with the distance\" - suggesting growing participation but inconsistent race experience. Less competitive depth than Almanzo 100."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Entry includes GPS tracking, luggage transport from Meudon to Châtellerault, drop bag service to checkpoints, accident insurance, free guarded bike parking, and comprehensive checkpoint support. The vermicelli soup alone earns KHS91's annual return, and post-race showers are available regardless of finish time."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Registration runs €60-100. Less than 2 hours from major French airports provides flight access, but KHS91's equipment upgrade to Fox suspension fork suggests the rough terrain may demand gear investments beyond typical gravel setups. Châtellerault's industrial heritage as a former weapons manufacturing site likely offers basic rather than luxury accommodation options. Higher total cost than Badlands."
