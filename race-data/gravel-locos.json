Highway 220 construction still adds delays, and you need to arrive by 6:30 am for parking at Bosque River RV Park. Packet pickup runs Friday 4-8 pm or Saturday morning 6-7:30 am. Over 1,000 riders funnel through tiny Hico—it works, but don't expect seamless execution."

Elite Julien Gagne \"made a bold solo move from a group of 10 with 60 miles to go\" and held it—meaning 60 miles of solo racing after already covering nearly 100. Justine Barrow \"ended up riding the last 40 km solo\" after thinning out her group. The distance creates race-defining moves that simply aren't possible in shorter events. Among the longest in gravel, comparable to Badlands."

Less technical than The Mid South."
      },

        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "The notorious \"Three B's\" climbs define this race. Jonas Orset describes the reality: \"Bam—we hit the first of three kickers. Cadence sits at 40.\" Another rider notes \"2,500 m in 250 km is a lot of climbing when it's all short, steep kickers.\" The 7,884 feet comes via relentless punchy climbs that break groups apart, not sustained mountain passes. More climbing than SBT GRVL at the same score."

Late May Texas heat creates race-defining conditions. Among the most weather-friendly events, easier than Badlands."

You're not dealing with any meaningful altitude effects here, just standard sea-level to low-elevation racing. The 'elevation' in this race comes from climbing hills, not starting high. Your lungs won't notice the altitude, but they'll sure as hell notice the effort. Lower altitude than Gravel Worlds — no thin-air concerns."

SAG support exists for major mechanicals only, meaning you'd better be self-sufficient when things go sideways.

It's real adventure, not manufactured hardship."

I drank about 9 liters of water. I tried to keep my heart rate around 140bpm, and my power below 200W since I've never ridden this far or for this long before, and I wasn't sure how hard to go. \n\nI didn't remember to shoot a lot of footage during the day, so this is just a few select scenes. \n\nStrava link: https://www.strava.com/activities/7143614525 \n\nThanks, Gravel Locos, and I'll be back again.

          "description": "The Gravel Locos gravel race is a FREE gravel race in HICO, TX. Some of the biggest hitters in cycling showed up in both male and female categories. Laurens Tan Dem showed up in preparation for Unbound so you know this race is gonna be fast. \n\nI daily vlogged my time in Texas preparing for the event, and the family and I had a blast. But for race day, I was as focused as could be. I didn’t expect much from this gravel race as I’m still recovering from a broken greater trochanter of my femur, so I tried to just hang on and suck wheels. \n\nGravel racing is usually long distance on multi surface roads with basically a road bike but with fatter tires. This gravel Locos race was 150 miles, 250 kms and took the winner 7 hours to finish. \n\n\n//////www.Whoop.com /\nhttps://bit.ly/2UXZ8zN follow this link and use code \"vegan15\" to get 15% off any membership\n\n//////The best kits in the world\nwww.ElielCycling.com - code veganbro10\n\n//////Flowformulas.com\nCode dudebro30 for 30% off. \n\n/////Hella sick Shirts n stuff\nhttps://www.ridebikesbro.com\n\n/////Recovery Shakes\nhttps://kyoku.com/ (Code \"thevegancyclist\" for 15% off)\n\nfollow me bruh\nhttps://www.facebook.com/theVeganCyclist\nhttps://www.strava.com/athletes/180549\nhttps://www.instagram.com/the_vegan_cyclist/",

          "transcript": "we're a new man\n[Music]\nwhoa wow\ndude i was i was cracked from mile one\nhey so we're talking about the gravel\nlocos uh\ngravel race in hico texas this is the\nbike i'm running\n42 double cross irc tires on the canyon\ngrail apadura frame bag\nwith a bunch of goodies in there um the\nrotor oval ring\nthat's what i'm running really like that\nbike we start off in this beautiful town\nof hico texas it's\nsuper like old-timey the hitters\nthat are here are hitting dylan johnson\nhe's like\ngone on a tear locally colin strickland\nright next to me what\nuh ted king is here peter stetna\nlawrence frickin\nten damn is here so to the left you can\nsee me\nup front with ted king peterstedt and\nassam boardman i don't belong here um\nthis is from travis's camera so just\nreal quick kind of talk about my\nnutrition and fueling um i've got flow\nformulas in both my bottles plus a camel\npack\nuh and then i had a ton of cliff like um\nshot blocks\ni also had some gels and some other like\nlittle goodies but there's also rest\nstops here so\ni do plan on refueling at some of the\nrest stops\nnow the beginning of this race was\nneutralized right so all the pros\nall the big hitters said let's get to\nthis river crossing let's get across\nthat first\nuh let's not race to that because it's\npretty sketchy\nto be honest i mean the river crossing's\ndeep there's lawrence 10\ndamn what that's insane i was actually\ntalking to him uh he had said he had\nwatched a few of my videos\nmy mind was blown so now even though the\nrace was neutralized dylan johnson\nstarts going up the road following colin\nstrickland\nonly to realize that colin strickland\nwas gonna go p and so\nthere it is dylan johnson trying to see\ncolin strickland's penis\nso now we come down this little hill\ninto the river crossing\nuh in the pre-ride the day before my\nbottles had flown out so i was making\nsure that those were in\nnow they had two different ropes you\ncould go left or right\neveryone's trying to get through this\nhuge river crossing\nit's deep um it's super sketchy i'm in\nroad shoes\nand so the river rocks i'm slipping now\nif this had actually been like full gas\nracing here\nthis would have been pretty gnarly so\nyou know give it up to the event\npromoters for kind of making sure that\nthat was safe\num you know you think you might have\nbeen able to ride through it there's\njust no way\ni think there's a video of a guy trying\nto ride through it didn't happen anyway\nso\nnow everyone's trying to make sure they\nmake it to the front\nbut the pros here they were you know\nnot taking this like ultra serious in\nthe very beginning\nwhich i thought was really cool it was\nreally cool that i got to ride with them\nfor quite a bit\nthey really eased into it uh eased into\nyou know putting full gas down so you've\ngot a pretty good size front group\nobviously everyone's trying to be around\nthe biggest hitters\nof the hitters tons of female\nrepresentation here\nlots of talent just across the board but\nthen\nted king goes to the front he says okay\nlet's start ripping it\nand i'm on the front pace-lining with\nted king\nand peter stetna um this is just\nlike i just don't understand what am i\ndoing here\nto remind you i'm coming off a broken\nleg this is about eight weeks after i've\nbroken my leg\ni've taken a long time off i have tried\nto build my fitness back as much as\npossible but my expectation\nof how well i'm gonna do in this race is\na zero\nit's as low as it can be so i don't know\nwhat my body's gonna do i don't know\nyou know what i mean i did a couple crit\nraces the week before this\ni felt terrible and so right now\ni'm actually just expecting my body to\nexplode just like\nshrapnel everywhere but the climbs\nweren't very long\nthey were kind of punchy you know you\ndid have to have some power\nbut for the most part you know it wasn't\nwhat i had expected it was going to be\nin the very beginning but it did just\nslowly start to ramp up and ramp up the\nspeed just was going faster and faster\nand faster\nand the gravel roads out here in texas\nif you look back at some of the daily\nvlogs i did leading\nup to this they are really fast\ni mean yeah to be honest um a road bike\nis totally doable on this like maybe 28s\nor even 30s\num so i sort of felt like i had i was\noverkill on my tires the 42s\nwere kind of big for this um i think a\nlot of guys were running something\nsmaller than that but everyone here is a\nlegit hitter like right there that's\nadam he's from canada\nuh phenomenal rider so now the gas just\ngets turned on a little more and a\nlittle more and a little more\nand you know i'm kind of starting to to\nsuffer a bit right\nmy endurance isn't super bad but my high\nend is just not there yet after the\ninjury\nyou can see it's starting to get strung\nout it's starting to be a\nproper race and a lot of these turns\ndepending on what tire pressure you're\nrunning you know we're kind of sketchy\nbecause the uh the gravel on top was a\nlittle loose\ni felt actually really good with my bike\nhandling skills\nand so i was pretty confident in the\nturns which was actually surprising\nusually\ni don't but again everyone here is just\nstarting to ramp it up\neveryone wants to be the front everyone\nwants to make that front group\nnow this is only within the first hour\nof the race and you can see\nthe the pace is getting turned up so\nmuch that people are starting to fall\nback through\nand i'm letting gaps open so i'm trying\nto cover them\nin the turns this kid in front of me and\nthe green jersey on that mountain bike i\nmean\ni think he's got junior gearing because\nhe's just spinning out maybe it's just\nmountain bike gearing\nbut the kids doing like 140 cadence\nright to stay with the group\nsuper impressive i have somehow managed\nto stay with this front group\nthis long we're coming down this really\nfast descent you can see travis\nsuper bummer he was feeling great but he\nended up flatting double flatting\nand he was on the 32s on a road bike so\ni think he had the fastest setup\nbut he had an issue and so then we have\nhis chain drops i come up i push him on\nthe back\nbecause i'm a friendly guy right trying\nto make those connections he hits me\nwith a thumbs up\ni mount it on my wall i'm so excited\nthen he gets all mad because he knows a\nfreaking vegan youtuber is going to post\nabout him in a video\nso we roll up to the first rest stop\nalmost everyone waited\nand there was an agreement that we were\nall gonna wait this water i got gatorade\ntoo if you want\nthank you sir\nand now i don't really know what this\nnext part is going to be like so i'm\nkind of freaking out right\ni just want to stay with the group but\nagain the pros are racing\nso pro-ish right they know their\ncapabilities and so\nthey weren't being super douchers about\nit they actually\nblended the the fondo kind of have fun\nstyle with also\nlet's race really hard so i was able to\nget back on just in time before\nthey started lighting it up because\nthere actually is a group now ahead of\nus\nuh where they didn't stop at the the\nrest stop to be honest i didn't have to\nstop at the rest stop because i had that\ncamel pack\nbut i i just didn't want to break that\nsort of unspoken rule\nit was actually a spoken rule the day\nbefore that we were all going to stop at\nthat first rest stop\nand now it really starts lighting up we\nare just over the first\nhour of the race and it is just like\nstarting to be full gas i mean i don't\nreally know what's happening at the\nfront\nyou can watch dylan johnson's video\nabout this he was\nup there in the front he has a much\nbetter recap of what the act\nwhat actually played out in the front of\nthe race i'm just always here to give\nyou\nthe back of the pack perspective so\nwe're flying\ni'm taking some big risks right here i\nflipped the camera around to show you\njust how bad this is\nso it's fast i mean we're rolling right\nin front of me colin strickland\nwinner of dirty cans of 2019 uh turner\ndowner of\nworld tour teams i mean this guy's an\nabsolute legend super cool guy actually\ni got to talk with him a little bit\nuh on the race day sam boardman right in\nfront of me from legion\ni mean these guys are flying flying\nand i'm opening up gaps left and right\nbecause\ni'm vegan and you know what i mean look\ni don't belong here\nbut i don't belong here it's all a big\nmistake\nand now here is where everyone just\nlights it up and i thought\nthe road section was going to be the\neasy part and they are just\ncrushing it i mean they are flying and\ni'm just running out of gas this is\nhouston again please\noh here's so now what i need to do is\nbuckle down\ni need to put in my biggest effort i\nneed to chase back on i need to make\nthat front group\nyeah so it didn't really happen we were\ngoing for it but just didn't have the\ngas\nnow right in front of me keith legend\nthis guy was just on the gas i mean\ndidn't really\nask for much i mean he was pulling so\nhard and we were\ndangling i mean we maybe were off the\nfront group by\nfive to ten seconds for maybe 20 minutes\nit was so close\nbut here's a clip again from the front i\nmean these are the guys we're chasing\nand it's like they brought out 10 right\nof these real heavy hitters um all nine\nof them or eight of them are in that\ngroup\nso anyway so that's who we're chasing we\ngo some of this\nthis water stuff there's a couple of\nthose little water crossings\nthis guy barrett in front of me he was\nextremely strong\nand look i did well here because of\nthese two guys\nto be honest keith and barrett for a big\nchunk of the ride\nthey were doing 95 of the work\ni did pull through a few times i was\ntrying to give some encouragement\nyou know but they they were just such\ngood guys\nuh allowing me to sort of sit on my\npower my high end power is just not\nthere yet but i was really happy with my\nlike tempo\ni actually averaged uh 3.2 watts per\nkilo for the entire seven hours and 40\nminutes\nso coming back from an injury eight\nweeks out of an injury\ni mean i don't think i could have asked\nfor any better than that um\nbut dylan johnson actually did less\npower and did better than i did\nso now keith is just pushing it he's\npushing it\nhe's pushing it on the front keith is a\nlegend thank you\nalso did you know that i'm riding with\nrigor berto\niran tell me that's not rigoberto dude\ni mean like same helmet same glasses\nanyway\nhis name's really barrett but we'll call\nhim ricobert though he's awesome\nso again keith and uh and and barrett i\nmean they\nare motoring we get to the second rest\nstop\num barrett fixes a seat i grabbed some\nepo\nand we're off we're flying and now we\ncome up to\nsketchville 101. i'm straight having war\nflashbacks of slipping and breaking my\nhip here\ni did fall but i actually saved it\npretty well but then you come into this\nlike\nrushing bit and since i have deep\nsection wheels\ni'm not even joking i was 99 close to\nlosing my entire bike like it almost\njust flew off into the river\nthat was slippery so we make it through\nthat most sketchiest bit and then any\nriver crossing after that we basically\nall\nlike almost walked our bikes but then we\nsettled in\nand made up some time\nbaby\nso now i'm honestly kind of just\nexpecting to explode into\npieces any minute because in it feels\nlike i'm barely hanging on now keith\nhe just went hunger flat is what he\ncalled it i've never heard anyone call\nit that before\nbonking um he cracked he was doing so\nmuch work though\nbarrett uh he's on the front we've got\nnow chase with us he actually came back\nfrom the front group\num so this is the crew we've got this\ndude in the brown\nchase uh barrett and myself chase\nwas really going for it i think because\nchase knew what position we were in\ni didn't but chase knew that we were\nracing for top ten so he wanted to get\nrid of everyone\nhe kept throwing in these attacks but it\nis pouring rain\nand i can see nothing zero my\nshades my glasses are completely muddy\nthis is what it looks like if i'm trying\nto look through my sunglasses\nright and so i'm wiping the sunglasses\nbut then it's smearing more mud\nso then i take off my sunglasses and now\ni'm getting sprayed in the eyes with\ndirt\nand chases attacking and so i can't i\nliterally dude\ncannot see anything my eyes are squinty\nand\ni am just getting blown apart but it is\nthe most fun i have had on a bike ever\njust racing full gas for top 10\namongst world tour pros i've got snot\nflying out of my nose it's soaking wet\nbut it's warm and so look i don't care\nwhat's going on\ni don't care if we're riding through\nbarbed wire fences if it's warm i'm good\nand so we do end up dropping that guy in\nthe brown\nand so it's just me barrett and chase\nchase keeps testing the legs he keeps\ngoing hard\nhere's me doing one single pull it's\nvery weak\nbut this guy chase he was on it and uh\nhe was flying\nhe kept attacking and i was barely\nhanging on it was actually\ni couldn't believe that i was able to\nhang on like he would attack and i would\nclaw my way back\nuh but they did all the work i mean i\nwas look the reason i did wells because\ni didn't really\nput myself in any bad situations i just\nsort of ate off everyone's plate which i\nknow is like\nracing etiquette anyways we roll in here\nfinish line i can see in the distance\nchase goes i give it everything i have\nhe sort of got the jump on me\nbut i mean i honestly can't believe i\nfinished this race\nlet alone that i'm coming here into the\nfinish like maybe in the second group\ndude that's 10 no 10.\nlike a dead fish i was cracked\nfrom mile one i've just been riding for\neight hours crack\nthat was awesome oh it's fun dude never\nforget that\ni was on the limit the entire time\nso i don't understand how i was able to\nbecause you couldn't draft you're like\non someone's wheel and\nyou're just getting sprayed in the eyes\ni have so much dirt in my eyes\nso much fun so 20 mile an hour average i\naveraged 3.2 watts per kilo the front\ngroup here\nagain you can watch dylan's video he has\nbasically that but\nlawrence 10 damn soloed away colin\nstrickland got second\nadam got third everyone went really deep\non this race i am over the moon i\nhonestly can't thank gravel locos enough\nfor bringing me out the love i got from\nthe texan community\nand how many people came up and and took\nthe time to say hi to me\nwas honestly like unbelievable um\nand look i know that i i'm not a great\nracer or anything like that and\nyou know sort of my channel is not\nnecessarily about winning races\nbut occasionally i'd like to do well and\ncoming off an injury\nuh thinking that my whole season is\nsmoked and being able to get top 10 with\nthis kind of field\nbro it's unbelievable this event is\ndefinitely on my calendar from now on\nif you have time if you can make it out\nto hico texas next year for gravo locus\ni highly recommend it\nit's a phenomenal event anyways thank\nyou so much\nthank you for watching as always vegan\ncyclist\ndo the skin\nforeign",

          "transcript": "i raced the gravel locos gravel race in\nhico texas a couple months ago and\nwanted to do a recap of how i did\nmainly using the vegan cyclist footage\nfor my bike setup i raced my trek pro\ncaliber 9.7 with a couple modifications\nthe first change was that i put on a 36\ntooth chainring to keep me from spinning\nout the second change was changing my\ntires from maxis aspen's to specialized\npathfinders and they were set up\ntubeless with orange seal sealant\nthe pathfinders were awesome for this\ncourse because it was extremely fast and\nthe middle part of the tread acts like a\nroad tire\nso that is me right there on the right\nof the screen i'm in the green and\npurple jersey so\nkeep an eye out\nfor the first 10 miles of the race it\nwas super chill because we were heading\ninto a river crossing i only normalized\n190 watts and averaged 17 miles per hour\nin the group\nthe group did do a couple sprints out of\nthe corners but that was just because\npeople were antsy to stay at the front\nnot because people were trying to make\nit hard\ni'mma be honest crossing this river was\nway harder than i expected the rocks at\nthe bottom would move around when you\nstepped on them and the current was\nsuper strong luckily there's a rope so\nyou can kind of hang on\nthere was a mad dash out of the river\nand everyone was going pretty hard to\ncatch up back to the leaders in reality\nthere really wasn't a rush and you\nwouldn't you would have been just fine\nif you rode at a normal pace\nthis hill was the first hard part of the\nrace the hill was pretty steep and short\ni made up a few positions doing about\n420 watts average\nseeing all the big guys suffer is always\nawesome because they put the hurt on me\non the flat and then on the uphill i get\nto cruise right by i'm breathing out of\nmy nose\nthe actual hardest parts of the race for\nme are these uh downhills these fast\ndownhills and these fast flats because\ni'm pretty much\nspun out and it's really hard to get\narrow on a mountain bike and there's a\nlot more drag\ni'm actually behind the vegan cyclist\nright now\ndrafting off of him on this little flat\npart after the first climb\nand\ni didn't realize how big he is but he's\nlike above six feet also right here\ni was fighting with this dude who's like\nbanging my bar into each corner and just\nlike cutting me off\nand uh eventually i got to get out in\nfront of him and didn't have to deal\nwith him the rest of the race\nthere's a lot of guys who are insecure\nabout riding next to a 17 year old kid\non a mountain bike so i kind of get it\nbut uh just be nice\nso it's starting to get really hard\nright now it's about 40 50 miles into\nthe race everyone is jamming it out\nevery corner sprinting it's getting\nstrung out uh there's some high speed\ndownhills you can see how strung out it\nis right there it's a big gap\njust brutal\nso there's me on the left uh standing up\nclimbing\nriding behind uh in the red shoes right\nthere that's emily newsom she\ni think she won the women's race but\num\nyeah i'm in front of this guy in the\nblack kit right there there's a guy\ngetting aerotalk getting dropped it's\ninsanely fast\nyou can see me kind of struggling to get\narrow it's hard to\nbecause i have to keep my fingers on the\nbrakes\nyou have to keep them out on the outside\nso it's kind of hard to get arrow\nspinning out right here\nthis is just\na torture to watch honestly\nso this is immediately after going into\nthe second aid station uh where everyone\nstopped we all filled up our bottles\nwith um they had like some gatorade and\nsome water\num people got like candy and stuff\nand then uh it's pretty chill right now\nright after there's people peeing and\nstuff so that's a good\nspot to take it easy\nso here i am descending in front of ted\nking which is pretty awesome\ni think i actually\nyeah i take that corner a little bit\nbetter than him he's got a sprint out\num so that's a good skill to have make\nsure you can corner well on this course\num hop in little\npotholes there\ni don't like to swerve\nand the dirt because you don't know this\ncorner is super fast\nit's getting really fast now vegan\ncyclists opening a gap\nso leading into the next clip i was\nactually in a three-man break with peter\nstetna and\nthe legion guy with a man bun\ni had come around this corner and i kind\nof just pedaled while everyone else\ncoasted came around everybody went to\nthe front and ended up in a break\nso i am currently at the very very front\nright now with\nuh i think\nuh dylan johnson peter stetna and the\nguy with the man gun man bun again um\nand so i am way up there the vegan\ncyclist is catching up i am in front of\nhim right now still\nand then he overtakes me because i am\nextremely tired\nuh extremely gassed out\nso for the rest of the 100 miles i rode\nwith emily newsom till\nthe mile 88 aid station\nuh then she kind of left really fast\nwe're also in this you know smaller\ngroup\nand then um once it started raining i\nwas all by myself\ni accidentally took this wrong turn\nended up on this highway\ncame to\nthe uh the main place where the race\nstarted and i'd only done 147\nmiles so i didn't go over the finish\nline because that would kind of mess up\nthe results because\nyou know you can't\ngo a different route and still finish\nand mess up everybody\nso the stats at the end of the ride was\na normalized power of 230 watts i\nfinished in a time of about\neight hours\nand i climbed about nine thousand feet\nand by the way the 230 watts normalized\nwas about 70 percent of my threshold\nthere's almost 400 tss and uh 17 miles\nper hour average speed\ni use trainer road to train for this\nrace and i've actually been on their\nsuccessful athletes podcast so if you\nwant to listen to that then it'll be in\nthe in the description",
