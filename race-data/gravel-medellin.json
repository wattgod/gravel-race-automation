Similar technical demands to Gravel Worlds."

Similar elevation profile to Gravel Worlds."

Enough altitude to notice if you're coming from sea level, but not the oxygen-starved suffering of true high-altitude racing in the Colombian Andes. Similar altitude considerations to Grinduro."

        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Racing gravel in the transformed city once \"associated with conflict and cartels\" now positioned as \"hub of innovation, culture, and urban development\" creates compelling narrative. Attractions like Comuna 13's street art tours and Guatapé's colorful lakeside setting add cultural depth beyond the racing."

        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Colombia's cycling culture runs deeper than most destinations, with the region described as \"filled with brightly colored towns and enchanting landscapes\" perfect for bike discovery. Being new means no established rider traditions, but the local cycling obsession provides solid foundation."
      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "With a field of 200-400 riders, new race in expensive international destination means small, self-selected field of adventure seekers rather than deep competitive talent. Colombian climbers will excel on the elevation sections, but overall field size and competitive depth remain complete unknowns for the inaugural edition. Less competitive depth than Almanzo 100."

Registration costs remain unannounced, but the cultural immersion adds substance beyond just the race itself."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Registration runs $100-150. International flights to José María Córdova Airport, Colombian accommodations, and logistics for getting your bike there safely will demolish your wallet. Even if registration stays reasonable, the total trip cost puts this firmly in expensive adventure category rather than accessible racing. More expensive than Atlas Mountain Race."
