Longer than Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

Flatter profile than Croatan Buck Fifty."

Similar climate challenges to SBT GRVL."

Your legs hurt from wind resistance and sustained pace, not oxygen debt in the low-elevation Drenthe province. Lower altitude than Gravel Worlds — no thin-air concerns."

No field size data or past winner information suggests either secrecy or mediocre participation numbers. European gravel scene is growing but still developing compared to US depth. Less competitive depth than Almanzo 100. As Femke Markus puts it: \"Really nice to ride a gravel race in between the road races.

      "expenses": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Registration runs €60-100. Netherlands accommodation, food and transport costs add up quickly in Western Europe. Jo Pirotte's race included 'twig in the wheel, empty battery and flat tire'—mechanical issues compound travel expenses.

          "description": "Again a large and strong starting field. Early present so was further ahead than usual. The first kilometers went very fast while it moved fairly quickly on unpaved paths.\n\nThe first 15km well from the front and drove very fast with an average speed of almost 40km/h despite the narrow bridge at km 7.5. Then I was in the second group a little less hard but still hard! Up to +- km 40 it went great (36+ km/h average) and was still nice and far ahead. Unfortunately, at this point there was a wasp flying into my helmet that I couldn't get out quickly and also stung me.\n\nAt the first feeding stop at km 70 but stopped for a while because I soon got a fierce sting and a burning sensation. I was getting more and more dizzy. Cool down and stop your legs and then try to continue on the road. Direct gas on it because had a nice group for this. Drove back but the tank hit army and army.\n\nThe best was from after km 110. Still by fighting another bottle filled at the last feeding post because despite my camelback and water bottles icm the heat too little moisture... I came to sit alone but still drove back a bit after the group. Pressed out another sprint and crossed the line after 4h 39m 18s.\n\n#inmyelemnt #instacyclingcommunity #lifebehindbars #iamsiroko #orbea #pov #rideinstyle #ridewithme #ucigravelworldseries #qualifier #gravelonefifty",

The course includes technical single track sections with ditches alongside where crashes occur during passing attempts, and lots of sand that requires lower tire pressures than full bar. The pace remains hot throughout with groups not settling as quickly as expected. Key challenges include hydration management in technical sections, with dehydrated riders seeing power drop to 200 watts in final hours. Feed stops offer free food and drinks. Riders recommend wider tires, hydration packs for water capacity, avoiding high tire pressure on sandy terrain, and conservative pacing for the 5+ hour event. The race serves as qualifying for world championships and attracts serious competition."
