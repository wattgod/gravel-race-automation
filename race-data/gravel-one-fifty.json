Longer than Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

Single-tracks avoided with wide roads allowing open racing where 'aero is everything' on the pan-flat terrain. Less technical than The Mid South."

Flatter profile than Croatan Buck Fifty."

James Ion noted stark contrast to previous year's 'mud bath' conditions. July and April dates avoid winter misery but guarantee wind exposure on flat Dutch terrain. Similar climate challenges to SBT GRVL."

        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Sea level Netherlands eliminates altitude concerns entirely. Even 60-year-old Freo ten Hove averaged over 30 km/h winning the masters 80km race. Your legs hurt from wind resistance and sustained pace, not oxygen debt in the low-elevation Drenthe province. Lower altitude than Gravel Worlds — no thin-air concerns."

        "explanation": "With a field of 200-400 riders, uCI qualifier brings competition, but it's Netherlands—small country, smaller talent pool. No field size data or past winner information suggests either secrecy or mediocre participation numbers. European gravel scene is growing but still developing compared to US depth. Less competitive depth than Almanzo 100. As Femke Markus puts it: \"Really nice to ride a gravel race in between the road races.

      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Registration runs €60-100. Netherlands accommodation, food and transport costs add up quickly in Western Europe. Jo Pirotte's race included 'twig in the wheel, empty battery and flat tire'—mechanical issues compound travel expenses. Roden location requires rental car or complex train connections from major airports without lodging guidance provided. Higher total cost than Badlands."
