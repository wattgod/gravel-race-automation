          "description": "The Gravel Revival Adventure route is already challenging enough. Make a majority of the course peanut butter wet after a nice February freeze-thaw, and it serves up a pretty good ass whooping on gravel.\n\nWe did 40 miles of the 44-mile adventure route that was on tap at the 2021 Gravel Revival weekend. We skipped out on the Fire Tower road section off of Highway 438. And my GoPro batteries skipped out on me after finishing the Blackwell Hollow section; so this has about half of the route we did on video. \n\nHere's the route: https://ridewithgps.com/routes/38254658\n\nCheck out the photos from the ride on our GGOT Facebook group page: https://www.facebook.com/groups/gravelgrindersoftennessee/permalink/516861079745802/\n\nPlease be sure to LIKE the video and SUBSCRIBE here to the YouTube channel.

The county was named for Edwin Hickman, an explorer and surveyor who was killed in an Indian attack at Defeated Creek in 1791.\" - Wikipedia.org\n\n\"The county was established in 1807, and named for Hickman at the suggestion of Robert Weakley, a legislator who had been a member of Hickman's surveying party. The original county was vast, extending to the southern border of the state. Hickman County was reduced in extent when it partially contributed to the formations of four counties: Wayne and Lawrence Counties in 1817, Perry County in 1819, and Lewis County in 1843.\"\n\nFactoids: The county is the subject of the Johnny Cash song \"Saturday Night In Hickman County.\n\nHickman County is also home to the Gosh Darn Gravel Grinder!  \"The GOSH DARN was founded in 2015 by Dave Thienel and Greg O'Loughlin. Their love for the miles and miles of gravel roads, creek crossings, primitive camping, and adventure found everywhere in Hickman County, Tennessee inspired them to create a way to share the fun!\" - http://goshdarn.org\n\nAnother race also calls Hickman County its home, Gravel Revival! - https://gravelrevival.wordpress.com\n\nIn this video, JOM rides a route close to 40 miles in length. This route includes plenty of hills, some u-turns, some re-routes, bush bashing / tromping about a cow pasture, a dog or two, and plenty of beautiful gravel roads adorned with beautiful scenery.

centerville anyway\nthat's the closest town if i've got it\nwrong or overlay exactly where i'm at\ni'm about 35 miles southwest of\nnashville tennessee i'm conducting a\npretty short ride in terms of gravel\nstuff about 35 miles or about 60\nkilometers 56 kilometers\nbecause i'm hoping to head into\nnashville after this ride and shoot some\nvideo\nthere as well so a twofer in one day all\nright let's get cracking\ni believe that today's route is the\nshort course\nof the gosh now i've got a role of the\ngosh darn gravel grinder\nit's a route i found on rival gps\ni usually don't ride other people's\nroutes i will ride event courses and\nthis is one of those cases so hopefully\nit's going to be a pretty sweet\nlittle ride i have heard of this event\nanyway\ncheck out the leaf changing and the\ncolors\nthat's a cool old store right there\noh yes that looks like our first gravel\nroad\nlook at that thing bloody beautiful eh\nright turn off we go\nas i stated earlier this is a pretty\nshort ride i'm doing today\noh don't mind a one-handed action\num anyway the this area\nis a ton of lovely gravel roads just\nfrom what i saw\npoking around on rival gps and the\nroutes affiliated with the gosh darn\ngravel grinder event\ni had more time and i was feeling\nnot so fatigued i've been on the road\nquite a bit\nlast week driving and so on riding a lot\ni would probably ride along the route\nbut today\n35 miles is more than enough well this\nis spicy\nthis course has me going along the edge\nof this dude's property\nso hopefully i'm not trespassing\nmaybe it's a race i only think\nall right i don't want to die\nokay to jump a fence\nwell this is a pretty cool course i have\nto say involves crossing some dude's\npasture\nwhatever you do don't forget to shut the\nbloody gate mates\nand there's my steed the rebel cycle\ncgi air seal with sram's\nforce etap y drivetrain notice the gear\nrunning\n43 by 36 big big combination very\nnaughty anyway\nand birds gvx 22 wheel set which\ni'm reviewing in fact all this stuff\nwill be posted at some point in the\nfuture to the gravelcycles.com website\nand youtube channel\nthe core says go down that way i'm going\nto go follow this path\nthis diagonal cuts a little bit off hey\nand it's been down by cows and\nmaybe other cyclists looks off the cut\nover at some point in time there's a\nbunch of cows over there\ni don't want them freaking out and i'm\nsure\nthere might be some landowner watching\nme right now do this\nwhoever designed this course is this\nthing legal what's the deal\nokay so this course is pretty dodgy i'm\non a fence line\nthere's a little dam down there and\nyeah i'm supposed to be going through\nthat way over there somewhere\ni might scoot around this dam and see\nwhat happens all the cows across the\npasture are watching me they're thinking\nhow is this guy gonna get out of here\nokay so i'm gonna skirt around this damn\ni guess\nand watch out for uh cow poo in the\nmeantime\nand hopefully get back on course all\nright what do you think do you think\nthose cows are going to start running\naround the place\nstampeding to get away from me i've not\nit's okay cows i mean you no harm\nhello girls they're super curious\nwell that's a fail because there's a\nbloody barbed wire fencing entire way\naround that damn\nso i'm going to backtrack this is a bit\ndodgy i have to say\nmaybe whoever designed this course had\npermission to go through this land\nwell guess what people this fence here\nbumps up to a road over there there's a\ncouple of houses right there right there\nthe course is supposed to go that way\nthen down there\nthis is when you get scruggled or by\ngoogle as i call it\nso i guess i'm going to jump this fence\nokay that's cool i was trespassing\nactually\nnext trick sneak through this dude's\nside yard\nit's always an adventure of this type of\ncycling isn't it\nall right no worries look at that we're\nback onto some kind of\npaved road i don't know exactly how to\nget out of here now\nthank you garmin i'm back on course\napparently\nand there's a good reason why i often\nwrite my own courses because when they\ndo go wrong\ni can blame myself so this\ncourse keeps knackering up\ni have to blame whoever i uh borrowed it\nfrom\nthat's okay they meant well that's what\ncounts\neven though this is a paved road it's\npretty nice scenery\nand this video was recorded in late\noctober\nso as you can see the fall of the autumn\nseason is well upon us\nand it's actually quite nippy today it's\nabout\num 55 no\n50 i think 50 fahrenheit so it's about\n13 celsius something like that\ni should be wearing gloves but it's not\nquite there yet for me to put the gloves\non i do have them i just don't like\nwearing gloves too much\n[Applause]\nhere's a nice driveway for you pretty\nsteep\nfollowing a pleasant little creek here\noh look at this we have a little creek\ncrossing coming up\noh then it goes to a gravel road how\nnice is this\nlovely all right well how deep is this\ni don't really want to get my shoes\ndunked today\nah not deep at all lovely\nhow sweet is that for a color photograph\nfolks\nyou trendsetters won't realize the\nextraordinary lengths i went to get the\nbike to balance\njust so i can get a sweet ass color\nphotograph and as soon as i said that\nthe bloody bite fell over\nit's okay there was no harm done it\ndidn't form the derailleur hanger\nthankfully soft landing\nthis is all part of reviewing bikes\nbikes follow you take photos and video\nand i have actually been a few hangers\nin my time\noh a dog's giving chase i think it's a\njack russell\nthat's given up those little buggers are\nlike velociraptors\noh this is a beautiful road\nhats off to the course designer\nfor including this road\noh we've got another creek crossing\nokay my thumb just got wet\nnice mix of gravel surfaces here and\nanother creek crossing\nalthough these are pretty easy\nit's on a nice concrete base\nin case you're wondering folks the tire\ni'm running today\ntyre is the panerai\ngravel king ss ss i say it stands for\nsuper sport\nokay like this chevrolet liner\nperformance vehicles have been gone\naround since the early 60s i think\nbecause these are fast tights and\nadmire these beautiful rock formations\nwill you\nif it was a very hot day which is not i\nwould totally be sitting in that little\ncreek\nrelaxing a while such a beautiful scene\nright here\nhere you go leaf peepers admire those\nfiery red leaves\nnow i'm sure there's a lot more\namazing fall follies you see in other\nparts of the country\ni know vermont's pretty off the chart\nthis part of tennessee is pretty tasty\nand there's no snow right now either\nare you coming to play what are you\ndoing you're being silly all right\nwhat are you doing they've got a meaning\nto a tender or running off\non to the next gravel road morning\nafternoon bloke just caught his dogs\nback\nthis is a very rapido gravelly road it's\nuh\nsuper hard packed it's not a wine rock\nbase\ni don't know what it is but i'm rolling\nalong very nicely\nhey settle down settle down\nthose dogs were too pleased without\nbeing woken up\nyou'd be nice you're part wolf what are\nyou\nyou're going for a nice run good lad\ngood lad\nthe dog just then was hiding behind the\ncar\njust a reminder if you don't like dogs\nthis route is not for you there's been a\nton of dogs\nquite a few have chased me\ni mean you know how i promise\nthis is a very scenic route\nbeyond the foliage\nis more of that creek i've been\nfollowing\nif you're into fishing that'd be a\npretty sweet place to hang out\nthat's a pretty cool house kind of out\nhere in the middle of nowhere\nthis is a really nice little route i've\ngot to say apart from the dodgy stuff\nright at the beginning\ni'm glad i kept going fantastic\nclimb number two of five\naccording to the garmin climb pro and i\ncan tell you\nit's a steep little bugger\nthis is the wharf warf cemetery\nthis is climb number three it doesn't\nappear to be too much\nsuper hard packed behind me it was quite\nit's about 2.4 k's and it rolls\nand undulates hello got a very steep\ndescent here\ntime for some handlebar can action\nhello horse i see you\nriding right through the center of a\ndairy property\ncheers trace parkway overhead\ni'm not taking the parkway i'm taking a\nleft i'm riding\nold natchez trace i'm approaching a\nhorse\nand slowing down\ni don't want to freak this horse out\nyo don't want to freak your horse out\ndude sorry\nyou good good okay no worries here we go\nhey what is wrong with you\ndumbass come on keep going\nif you listen carefully you might be\nable to hear the pigeons hanging out in\nthis\nbarn\nalso note the super steep climb just\naround the corner\nbit of a slog this one\nthis is an interesting road towards the\nend of the course\nanother nice little creek crossing\ni've got a very steep climb here it's\ngonna be hard to ride and\nuh use the camera\na couple angry dogs too yeah\nthis looks like goes to some bloke's\nhouse now mind you the gate is open\nand there's no no trespassing signs\nnow let's do it and hope for the best\ni gotta figure out plan b because this\npart of the course is dodgy as hell\nin fact if i recall there was a second\ncopy\nthat someone had made and i think that\nmodified it so it tricks\nthis problem plan b involves an 18 grade\nright now\nthus far plan b is working out just fine\nand i should be reconnected with the\ncourse\nin about another kilometer back onto the\ncourse at this\njunction oh yeah look at this this is\ndefinitely handlebar\ncamera territory\ni'm having absolutely no luck with\nsidewall cuts lately i've got another\none a moment ago i'd use the gup\nthere to help uh with the sealant it's\nleaking right there\nuh hopefully you'll see what i don't\nknow i don't mind to plug it we'll see\nhow it goes\nthey got mechanical problems and uh i\nmight have a slow leak\ni've got about 10 k's the ride hopefully\nit holds\ni haven't plugged the sidewall cut it\nseems to be holding\ni'm going to ride this pavement\nwhich will take me back to where i\nstarted from\nso unfortunately i'm going to cut off\nsome gravelly rows well folks that wraps\nup today's ride a shorty buddy goody\nthanks for tagging along if you haven't\nalready please subscribe to the\ngravelcycles youtube channel and don't\nforget to click the bell button to be\nnotified of future videos\nand madness and everything else as
