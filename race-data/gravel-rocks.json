        "explanation": "The 10km Friday night stage feels like warm-up filler before Saturday's substantial 92km across morning (52km) and afternoon (40km) loops. Cut-off times are generous with Saturday's 39km section closing at 12:30pm, reflecting the event's 'all levels welcome' philosophy rather than distance challenge. More compact than Grinduro."

      "technicality": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Private Duncombe Park Estate trails and North York Moors terrain should offer technical challenge, but the 'all levels welcome' marketing suggests they've neutered the difficulty. Without course recon available, you're gambling on whether it's actually technical or just marketing fluff. Similar technical demands to Gravel Worlds."

        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "4000ft over 55 miles through North York Moors National Park's undulating terrain delivers sustained climbing efforts across the private estate. The course profile combines gravel roads with flowing singletrack sections that take advantage of the natural topography for both challenge and 'breathtaking vistas.' Similar elevation profile to Gravel Worlds."

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Historical weather data shows average highs of 65°F and lows of 51°F, with a 68% chance of rain on any given day. July in North Yorkshire brings mild summer conditions but the Friday night stage starting at 21:30 requires headtorch lighting and adds weather uncertainty. No historical climate data available, but riders must prepare for typical UK weather variability during peak tourist season. More weather exposure than Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

      "altitude": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "North York Moors terrain maxes around 1,500 feet elevation, offering no meaningful altitude training benefits. The undulating landscape provides climbing volume but stays well within low-altitude parameters throughout the estate and National Park sections. Lower altitude than Gravel Worlds — no thin-air concerns."

      "adventure": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Private estate access through Duncombe Park and North York Moors National Park offers exploration potential you can't replicate on public roads. The Friday night timed segments add adventure factor, assuming they don't safety-lawyer it into boredom."

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Organized by Focal Events (creators of Europe's largest gravel event, Dirty Reiver) with SCOTT Sports UK as title sponsor for 2026. However, this positions itself as 'A different kind of gravel event' emphasizing festival atmosphere over competitive prestige, explicitly welcoming non-racers for 'trails, camaraderie, and festival atmosphere.'"

      "race_quality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Seven timed segments across two days with chip timing and marked GPX routes provide structured racing format. However, the multi-sport festival design mixing gravel riding with trail running, DJ entertainment, and brand expo village suggests event execution prioritizes festival experience over pure race focus."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Weekend includes DJ performances Friday and Saturday evenings, barista coffee, quality food vendors, and brand expo village alongside the racing. Sunday social rides and family activities extend the festival atmosphere, though one forum rider noted preference for 'small & intimate' events over large crowds."
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "The event brings together both gravel riders and trail runners in what organizer Neil Atkinson calls celebrating 'the best of both disciplines' in a friendly atmosphere. However, as an upcoming 2026 event, established community connections remain unproven beyond the festival format design and Focal Events' track record."
      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Explicitly marketed as beginner-friendly with 'average fitness' requirements and generous cut-off times. Teams of 4 are welcomed alongside individual categories, but the 'not racing? No problem' positioning and focus on festival atmosphere suggests recreational participation over competitive depth. Thinner field than Ouray Gravel Grinder."
      },

        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "£125 weekend entry includes two nights camping, parking, access to private estate trails, chip timing, feed stations, showers, and event village entertainment. The package covers accommodation, course access to exclusive Duncombe Park terrain, and festival amenities that would cost significantly more if purchased separately."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Saturday-only entry at £85 provides reasonable access, but full weekend camping is where value emerges. E-bike riders face additional challenge as 'there are no facilities to charge batteries at the event centre or on course,' requiring battery management planning for the multi-day format. Higher total cost than Badlands."
