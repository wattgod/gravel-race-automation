Cut-off times are generous with Saturday's 39km section closing at 12:30pm, reflecting the event's 'all levels welcome' philosophy rather than distance challenge. More compact than Grinduro."

Similar elevation profile to Gravel Worlds."

July in North Yorkshire brings mild summer conditions but the Friday night stage starting at 21:30 requires headtorch lighting and adds weather uncertainty.

Lower altitude than Gravel Worlds — no thin-air concerns."

Thinner field than Ouray Gravel Grinder."

E-bike riders face additional challenge as 'there are no facilities to charge batteries at the event centre or on course,' requiring battery management planning for the multi-day format. Higher total cost than Badlands."

I thoroughly enjoyed the event despite the weather and challenging conditions. The organisers put on a great event, with some amazing trails and scenery. If you haven’t explored North York Moors then you need to! It was so varied there was something for everyone. Safe to say I was sold and I’ll be back next year! Thank you for having us Gravel Rocks 24 🙌🏼\n\nAlso, big thanks to Extrauk and Crankbrothers for the support over the weekend 🙏",

          "transcript": "what's up we are back baby and we're\ndoing something a bit different this\nweekend and I'm a little bit nervous so\nwe're actually entering um my first\ngravel race um so we're here in North\nyor MOS just outside of\nHelmsley um at this\nwonderful\nestate which\nis absolutely stunning it's been a bit\ncold hence why I've got a million layers\non um but we just walked up and I'm\nactually working this weekend for Crank\nBrothers um but we're going to race as\nwell which is cool um so concept of the\nrace is it works a bit like a mountain\nbike and Juro so there is a loop this\nevening um which is time stage which is\nabout 10K and then tomorrow we race\nagain which is an 80k Loop but between\nwithin the 80k loop sorry there are time\nstages um throughout the rides we don't\nknow where they are um all we do is have\na GPS and it will tell you whilst we're\nout there once we enter a stage but we\ndon't know how long the stage is until\nobviously we get to the side so it could\nbe anything from like 3K 5K and then\nlike this evening which is 10K um so\nwe're going to see how we get on um I'm\na little bit nervous I've been entered\ninto Pro category which is a little bit\nscary cuz there's a lot of people in\nthere wearing really tight light C and\nfrankly that's not my bag so let's see\nhow we get on keep you posted at the end\nof that section um exposure lights will\nbe there and if you've got any issues\nwith your lights they will support you\nto be able to carry on so they will be\nthere there is two time segments tonight\nuh which will\nbe what here we go here we\ngo is the whip\nlook how fast she is look at these two\nloses what are you not doing they\nchickened out you chickened\nout well I'm taking one for the tea\nwhere's\nRich looking there's Rich looking Pro\nped up there he is he's hiding\njacket that's a feminine looking jacket\nyou got on\nthere suiting it\nperfectly streamline figure hugging she\nsign up the\ncompetition oh there she\n[Music]\nis I'm\nwinning first\nlady let's go go go go\nso we just missed start the\nstage just cruised through so we're\ngoing to blast up no idea how long it is\nso we she get out\nthat was end of stage\none and now we're kind of in\na Le's on stage\nnow and then we got one more and then\nback to the\nstart tactics for tomorrow don't go to\nthe start of the pack cuz none of this\nlog can ride downhill is what I've\nrealized so we did some dodgy\novertakes we' got stuck behind a lot of\npeople\nwhich then overtook me on the uphills\nso breath so the sense of our strong\npoint and we need to make sure we're\nahead of everyone or at the\nback so yeah no to\nself right here we go stage\ntwo\nuphill and then a flap to the bar\napparently\nlet everyone go a bit\nsinger\nreally were you first\nback quite a while didn't you start at\nthe back no no I started towards the\nfront CU I wanted to stay\nout yeah I don't know if you at the\nfront all it's the rich one I was with a\nbit of a I came last out\noh my\nGod I clearly don't know my kilomet cuz\nwhen he said 1.8 km I was like oh yeah\neasy and then got halfway up and it just\nwent pong and then loose everyone was\noff like walking their\nbike I stay\non but my lungs in my mouth right now\nbut we\ndone we made it and it was\nhard so welcome to extra\npits This Is How We Roll hey Mish what\nyou\nhaving I'm going to go sugary copperberg\nI'm going to go the\nsame there we go copperberg recovery\ndrink that's what that\nsays we're going to enjoy this and then\nwe go against Tom here we go so the\nlovely guys at Wahoo have lent me a unit\ncuz I forgot mine on the way here but we\nrun one of these already so this is the\nRAM and we're going to take it out today\nand it's\nabsolutely pissing it down this is your\nnormal workout page with all your normal\nstats speed distance time you can zoom\nout for more information zoom in for the\nmost important things you've got a\nclimbing page don't need that no and\nthen you've got a map page and we're\ngoing to put a route on\nso the route for today is already\nuploaded which is amazing 80k gravel\nrock Saturday yeah we'll see about that\n80k but um and that will load on there\nyou've now got the climbing profile and\nyou can see the entire route there oh\nJesus up and down but if you zoom in\nyou've just got the next 2 km so it's\nquite a flat start so you got nothing to\nworry about great now I've got the uh\nthe map and the root loaded and you'll\nbe following these colorful Chevrons and\nas you move the map will move with you\nthis one has two GPS sensors inside\nwhich means it's super fast at finding\nwhere you are um and that's especially\nuseful when you're out in a place like\nthis in the middle of nowhere um exactly\nor if you're in a builtup city um with\nlots of high buildings and it's hard to\nfind a signal this one's really quick at\nit um\n64 64 color screen 64 color screen\nknowledge 64 color screen um which just\nreally helps for yeah really helps for\num seeing see the map and seeing where\nyou're going um you can paare all the\nsensors in the world that you want to\nyour heart rate monitor power meter\nCadence Sensor speed sensor all kinds of\nthings it's also uh it's got all the new\nfeatures on so it's got music Control\nGoPro control which is exclusive to W at\nthe moment um or we can make a light\nradar control as well and we can make it\ndark mode Let's make it dark you can\nalso attach it to the dance SM as well\nand\num pleasure\nthank you very much I'll see you at the\nFinish Line good luck you need it so it\nis Saturday morning and we've just\narrived at camp and it is absolutely\nGrim it's been raining all morning so\nwe've had our breakfast we're going to\nKI up get the bitee ready um nice guys\nof Wahoo just lent me um a unit cuz I\nforgot mine um we got some snacks cuz\nwe're going to fuel up so it's 80k today\num there are four time stages we don't\nknow where the stages are um out on\nroute so similar to last night we'll\nhave a marshall that will tell us that\nthe stage has started but we don't know\nhow long those stages are so they could\nbe anything from 1K to five whatever so\nwe'll find out but um we've been I've\nbeen ill um all\nweek so we're just going to see how we\nkind of get on it's really cold and\nreally wet so I think we're going to\nwrap up warm take lots of food um and\njust see where we get but hope hopefully\nwe'll get all the way around um but yeah\nenergy is low um but hopefully the\nadrenaline will kick in and my\ncompetitive side will come out oh my God\nI should have put gloves\non how' you get in in Well Done guys\nhave a good day out a day\nout second let's go\noh my God it's\nmuddy she's a big muddy\nwa I be\nright stage one done we are all\nabsolutely sto stoked not stoked I'm\nvery very\nstoked it was good fun there how are\nyour legs after that yeah okay so far\nyou're a dark hor aren't you really yeah\nup to about\n30k need a Andrew's lying I think he's a\nsecret trainer he's newly joined extra\nand I think he's made out he's really\nunfit but he's definitely not we're just\nwaiting for the yaty brothers which I\nthink just blew up on the last uphill\nwhich was very steep I am very grateful\nfor 12sp Speed on this\nbike he's laughing at me cuz he wish\nhe's got had 12\nspeed right so we're in the middle of\nnowhere it's still\nraining and um Valley View do we know\nhow far we've been Valley View Farm well\nthere's no view whatsoever\n10K I think we Fair storm 10K this is\nnot the speed I'd normally go out on a\ncruisy gravel ride but we'll crack on N\nWahoo's doing a marvelous job\nhey no\noh\now ow\nstraight straight onto a main road\nhe that was a roughest thing I've ever\nridden that is a fanny\nSmasher oh my\ngod oh cows this could be fun\nsh\nright here we go dropping into second\nstage going this\nway let's go\nstage two Deb how did it go oh wonderful\nyeah wonderful sneaky up was in the\ndownhill stations yeah I'm I'm calling\nthat the Marshall said it was downhill\nand it definitely wasn't tiny bit at the\nend yeah yeah that doesn't count yeah\nhopefully it's a downhill segment soon\ncuz shark a up\nhere am I happy to see\nyouy please\nScoops I'm not\nsure look at this get\non downhill yeah can we um hit a road\nand get\nback I think it's the best coffee setup\nI've ever seen thank you pretty rad\nI think that is the finest flat white\nI've ever seen well\ndone it's 1.7\nkmep in the air right\nwell Andrew spot is\ndummy I think it's\nwonderful so there's a bit of\ncontroversy\nunbel so the signage is a bit\nquestionable in terms of how much ascent\nand descent the last one we got told it\nwas downhill and it was definitely\nuphill now we've been told it's downhill\nand really fast but the start is up\npill technically we should have just\nrolled in from that fire Road and just\ngone for\nit right see how we get on this one how\nfar is it is it say Find DM Andrew how\nmuch 1.7k so each stage so far has been\n1.7k isn't\nit which is like a horrible distance I\nthink it's like a\nSprint did you do last night it's like\nyou remember when you used to do 1500 m\nrun the 800 800 so you kind of got to\nSprint but you don't want to it's a bit\nlike that we\ngo right over the mark let's go get some\nspeed and off\nright we're dropping in to state is this\nfour now stage four stage four this is\nstage\nfour I think this is is undulating again\nso we'll see how we get on right thank\nyou have a good\none\nwho God let that catches few people out\nwa oh it's\nslick it is w\nstage four done y's got\ncramp we got one more\nstage and we're at you're\nright um we've got one more stage and\nwe're actually coming back to the Finish\nArena\nso don't know what the last stage is\ngoing to be I'm absolutely crawling cuz\nI am definitely underestimated\nhow much food I'd need especially\nkeeping up with these boys um bit A Min\nday though last stage was slick rick it\nwas really wet\nso um different tires maybe next year\nand I think narrower skinnier tires\nprobably would have been better but um\nyeah the end is near pretty sunny in St\nit's finally stopped raining which is\nbonus um so let's get it\nhome come on go go go\nW holy\nyo just got back from gravel rocks\nyesterday and big cleanup jobs as you\ncan see behind me today typically the\nsun is shining that bit's not it was\nthat yeah the sun is shining somewhere\num typically the Sun's shining today but\nthey didn't put a dampener on the event\nover the weekend um I think it was\npossibly some of the worst conditions\nI've ever ridden in um\nbut that being said the rout was still\ngreat um the guys put on such an amazing\nevent um the route itself was about 80%\nOffroad which I wasn't complaining about\nit made it hard going in the rain and\nthe mud but um it made for a really\ninteresting ride so um I was pretty\nstoked that most of it was Offroad um\nbit of Road sections you were grateful\nfor but the end mind but um yeah great\nevent couldn't recommend it more to\nanyone that wanted to do their first\ngravel event it's not face orientated it\nis but you don't have to be you could\nkind of go at any Pace you wanted to\nlike the whole 80k Loop you can do at\nyour own pace um some people were going\nsuper fast but you could go party Pace\nwhatever you wanted to do you could run\nin groups um there was no kind of system\nin terms of order of people going out so\nyou can ride with your mates um\nthere was also an option to cut cut the\nroot short so you could do 60 um which\nis also an option but yeah if you wanted\nto race it you could have but for like\nme and the guys I was riding with we did\nit pretty chilled and then when we got\nto the stages we just we went through a\nbit more um as an event amazing\ndefinitely recommend it and I can see\nlike next year they've already got plans\num to make it even better and even\nbigger like the some incredible Brands\nhere like ourselves cranking Brothers\nbut also uron to Peak exposure\nWahoo um like the King was incredible\nlike we got breakfast lunch and dinner\nevery day but the food was amazing like\nit was just one company I can't remember\nthe name but super nice guys and really\ngood food like just what you wanted\nafter a big day in the saddle coffee was\nincredible um they provided cakes and\nstuff and there was loads of activities\ngoing on in the evening um they had DJs\nthere like a big Marquee so it even\nthough the weather was crappy you could\nkind of show in there and stay warm\nshowers were insane they were hot\ndespite like the amount of people that\nwere there they were nice and hot super\nclean loads of toilet facilities washing\nfacilities places where you can wash\nyour bikes motor put on a big display\nwith a cleaner and everything which was\ngreat cuz we got up um but yeah as\nlike that was my first gravel event and\nand I would definitely go again I wasn't\nfit enough for it um not to keep up with\nwell not to be on the podium anyway\nwhich was a bit sore to take but um I\nthink that's the inner Inner Mountain\nBike Racer in me but um yeah madebe me\nrealize I'm not\nfit but um yeah I'd definitely go again\nand I definitely recommend it to anyone\njust wanted to try a gravel event and\nkind of see if they like it the whole\nuro stage princip po I think work really\nwell um it meant that you had like a\nTarget to hit and um it was great to\nlike see everyone chatting about it\nafterwards like similar to like in Juro\nracing if if youve ever done that at the\nbottom of the stages we're all having a\nchat kind of discussing like who fell\noff where and who overtook you and\nsomeone inited me or whatever but um I\nget AR make from this and but yeah\ndefinitely recommend it I'll be there\nnext year so hopefully see you there too\nwhat",

so\nwe're handing out free samples\nso that the anti-grampy one\nseems to be open\nbut so just being out here\nbeautiful riding\nand look at the conditions\nabsolutely blown dry\namazing\nand then we're back up\ntop of kepwick bank again\ni need to work out where we go from here\nhave a feeling we go off the front edge\nand then back up again\nwhich is cruel but\nyou know means we get\nanother descent\nwhich is always a good thing\ntrying to think about the climb up\nafterwards\nback along cleveland way now\nand we've got about 10 miles left\nwe didn't drop down through bolt b which\nis a surprise and a blessing\ni think that means we do paradise trail\nto finish\nconditions are perfect\nwe're bombing along here a bit of edwin\nthat's all\ni know i don't like much\nbut this is really where i'm\nappreciating\nthat explorer kit the most\njust being able to\nbuzz along here\nsuper smooth\nnice and efficient\ni hope that needs shotting\n70k in\nand even with this kit\nyeah before\nwe triceps are feeling it so\nwithout it\nthis would have been savage\nreally does\nmake a difference\nso yeah\ni'd like to put more\ncalories into getting up the climbs\nsignificantly more it's all told it does\nadd a bunch of weight\nfor the dropper\nthe wheels\nit's gotta be getting off the\ntwo and a half kilos i mean i've just\nmade that up from yet but\ni know this stick weighed\nwhen he had force\nwide range on it when i first got it\nand it's now 10.6 kilos so\nit's at least two\ni think maybe more\nyou know\nit's been out of rift down here\nwithout worrying about\ntires off\ni shouldn't say that but\ncrack on\nthat's undoubtedly adding speed\nnow then\nand reducing fatigue as well\nin the long run\nit's the best bit of this descent\non the camera\nthis is rougher\ngnarly\nmike just doesn't prepare\nwith this kit on\nleft-hand line\nway around here\nwhat did we go up there\nthey were pointing down here\nwas it\ni guess it's around this corner then\nsee if we can find an arrow\nyeah arrow here\nhappy days\ndive dive dive\nall right now we're into\nparadise trail\ndescent\nfrom the mountain bike descent as well\ni think it's red ready maybe blue\nit's a bit of fun\na little single track\nsurprisingly quite bumpy it's just cuz\ni've had a lot of traffic over summer\nand there's a drop coming up drop that\nsaddle yeah there we go\nplease don't cramp\ndropping in\nas well here's all cars\non your left hand side please\noh it's good for the soul\ni'll be taking mountain bikes on a\ngravel bike\neven if this kit is\ndefinitely cheap\nnot so bad\ni wiped out spectacularly in the way\nthe ladder was riding out\nwith\nout as well\nthat wasn't the other way around anyway\nwe both ended up on floor\nto see if i can do any better in the\ndrive today\nnot much of a burn but we'll use one of\nthe guys\nswitch back up here\nwait the opposite lock swing it in\nfinish flicking\ntime oh we've got that big block there\nlet's concentrate the mine oh i'm\ndefinitely blocking him out there\ni should be up\non that trail there\nboth shots\nout learning\ni would say about this fork\nbecause obviously it's longer than a\nstandard fork\njust tip the seat angle back a bit so\nyou've either got to get\nright onto the nose of the saddle\nor out with saddle on sleeper stuff\nstop the front end wandering around a\nbit\nbut the fact it tracks up and over stuff\neasier\nthat certainly helps and obviously\nwith its sides when you're out the\nsaddle\nit's not quite as tall as it would be\nnormally\ni'm broken i'm not gonna lie this is the\nlongest i've ever ridden with cramp\nnot letting go\nnearly done though\nand now\nsun's out\nthese are the views\nthat this part of the world's all about\nunbelievable\nplace to ride by\nfinal furlong now\noverlooking\nwhite stone cliff\nincredible views on here\nlovely little bit of\nbike path\nthrough the woods to finish with\nnice little flourish\noh\ndon't forget to leave me back\nand like i say\nquite a few of these sections have just\nevent only so\nobviously don't ride them\noutside the event\nall of these bits\nalong sutton bank\nare official bike trails they're just\nbrilliant for gravel\nyou can go all the way north\nit's not a salt burn if you want you're\nnot doing overnight i want some fish and\nchips snacking plus magazine\nthat was a stunning ride\nand just the whole loop\nall right cheers\nthanks so much\nit's been awesome as you can see\nnot every family ride ends in a big\nsmile but\ncertainly should\naround here\nthis has been a tough\n80k\nespecially with the completely lousy\nprep i've done\ni'm saying off lagoon as well i didn't\nknow\nbike has been absolutely flawless\nwell then\nand the weather\nhas come spectacularly good\nso now\ni've just got\nthe last bit\ntwisty single track\nto have fun on\ndrop me saddle\nbetter turn and burn up through here\nget these g40s\ncracked over\nand like i say if you want to have a\nlook at\nindividual reviews on all the kit\nand this bike as a whole\nthey're all on the channel\ni'll put the latest ones up\nthere's a link\ndefinitely takes a gravel bike\nfully into\nthe mountain bike\nsphere of operations i have hits and\nsections today\ni can absolute head case\nand it has wiped my derriere\nthank god because i've been in a lot of\ntrouble\nand yeah i've been bottoming it out that\nfork regularly but\nit's amazing\nhow much control\nyou get before\nit gives out\nand even when it does it's pretty damn\ncontrolled and being able to slam that\nseat\nthat's an absolute godsend\nin terms of control\nso i mean\nand if you do come up\nnormally these are the markings you're\nlooking for\nblue is the four uh paradise is a red\ngray trail and you've got a cliff trail\nwhich is green\nright

Weather can vary from grey and cloudy to clearing views. The event includes feed stations and uses a time stage format similar to mountain bike enduro racing. Riders recommend strategic positioning based on climbing versus descending strengths, noting that many competitors struggle with technical descents but can overtake on climbs."
