Less technical than The Mid South."

Samson Large reported that 'Pecan Shaker 2024 wasn't without tragedy, as we did have quite the rain before raceday, making for soggy conditions on certain areas of the course.' The event moved from fall to spring in 2024 due to scheduling conflicts, with one rider requiring medical attention during challenging conditions. More weather exposure than Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

Lower altitude than Gravel Worlds — no thin-air concerns."
