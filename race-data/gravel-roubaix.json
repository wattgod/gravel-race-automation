The finish on Drake Well BMX track 'proved to be quite the challenge for some at the end of a long ride.' All routes boast 95% gravel coverage across nearly 2,200 miles of public gravel roads. More technical than most — comparable to Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego.

April conditions started 'in the mid 40's and chilly' with 'temps climbing along with the elevation gain' throughout the day. A 2019 edition featured 'a very windy day for this race.' Dry conditions create dusty roads with recently graded sections having scatter gravel. Similar climate challenges to SBT GRVL."

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Pennsylvania terrain tops out around 2,500 feet elevation with minimal altitude impact.

Modest altitude compared to Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."
