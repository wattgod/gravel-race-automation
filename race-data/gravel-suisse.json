          "description": "Episode 2 of 3 in a weekend packed full of climbing in Villars, Switzerland. \n\nSaturday morning I rolled out from Villars at 6am for a 7.30am start from the UCI Cycling Centre in Aigle. From the valley floor we climbed to the summit of Villars, on the Col du la Croix. \n\nAs mentioned in my previous video I didn’t have the intention to race, but I still wanted to ride ‘smart’ and save energy where possible. This worked well on the brief flatter sections on the valley floor. \n\nThanks to Velo Edge, and Matt in particular for helping me with the bike build of my Enve Mog. Not known as a climbing bike, but watch this video and then decide :)\n\nOn Instagram: le.pointdevue\n\nWatch out for episode 3 where I attempt to qualify on the road!",

          "transcript": "[Music]\nBreakfast at 4:30 a.m. I'm going back to\nbed for an hour.\nPre-made burger though is decent,\nbut it's gone down pretty quick and I am\ngoing back to sleep. Bye.\nJust in the middle of my warm up, ready\nfor the gravel race. Uh, I'll be honest,\nI don't think it's going to be a race\nfor me today. I'm going to take my time,\nwarm up into it. And then from 30 m to\n60 mi,\nit's basically uphill.\num which I'd much rather cuz I don't\nhave to deal with any technical\ndescents. So um\nbeen a little bit sluggish, but we're\ngoing to head back to the start line now\nand get ahead\nand uh yeah, go from there. See how we\ngo.\nOne of the coolest things of the day was\nrolling out from UCI Cycling Center just\nhere. And this is my bike for the day.\nEnvy Mog in a size 49 frame. Hunt\nwheels, uh, ShraMM red axis group set.\nAnd this is us now at the start, ready\nto go. Um, age groups are a bit mixed\nup, but the pros went off first, so it\ndidn't really matter.\nSo, starting quite far back on the grid,\nactually. And this is me just after the\nfirst flat section, chasing a group\nahead. Like, I wasn't overly stressed. I\nknew it was a long first climb with some\nsteep sections, so I just let people do\ntheir thing, go out hard, um, and then\njust ride my own tempo and just catch\npeople on the climb when there was a bit\nof bit of room. Um, and this seemed to\nwork really well actually. Um, you know,\nI will post my data later on, but you\ncan see how linear my approach was. Uh,\nvery much rode within myself even on\nthese steeper pictures. You can see the\nguy in the black skin suit here really\nstruggling, but my 4052\ngearing really came into its own here\nand just allowed really good cadence and\njust managed to pick groups off at the\nclimb. There was some serious pitches of\naround 25% a couple of them in the in\nthe first climb. Really, really grim.\nAnd I was just pleased with my kit\noverall. I put some new tires on. And I\nknow it's not ideal to put new stuff on\njust and race it straight away, but I\nhad to cuz I had a puncture on my PLLI.\nSo, I put some new Maxis tires on. And I\nwas really, really pleased with the grip\nand the weight. They actually felt a lot\nlighter than the Pirellis and at times\nactually allowed enough grip for me to\nget out the saddle and stretch the back,\nstretch the legs. But you can see from\nmy cadence here, I was running a really\nhigh cadence on the climb and just\nkeeping the legs moving. I felt like it\nwas important after last night to just\nmake sure that I'd flushed everything\nout. This was still half an hour into\nwhat I would call like a high tempo\neffort. And I'd really warmed up to this\npoint. I was halfway up the first climb.\nFelt good. And I'm not sure how many\npeople I actually caught, but it was\njust part of what I had planned of\nletting people go and then slowly find\ngaps once the Zift style racing had\ncommenced. And yeah, I always find this\nwith gravel races. People back\nthemselves to go really, really hard.\nAnd I think I accumulated something like\n10,000 ft for this climb. And if you put\nyourself in the red even before the\nfirst climb, you're going to be in\ntrouble. And this is snippets of the\nfirst climb. You can see they are all\nvery, very steep pictures. And people\nare really struggling over their bike.\nAnd I felt it was really important to go\nback to just riding a steady pace and\nfinding my way into the the whole day.\nAnd I did that and I was really happy to\nthis point.\nMy worry was that coming over to the top\nof the climb, I ideally wanted to be\nwith a rider at least because I hadn't\nrecon the course and I knew this team in\nfront of me were local actually to the\nevent and I wanted to come over the top\nwith a group or you know feeling\nconfident on the descent and kind of\nplayed into my hands. But I didn't hold\nthe wheel for very long on the long\ndescent. And yeah, it just comes down to\nthe fact that I'm, you know, not\nconfident on these descents and I had a\nbit of work to chase back on and I\nmanaged to do that. But it was reading\nwhat was going on in front of me and I\ncame to this section here and there were\npeople sprinting at this section. So, I\nkind of knew that people who had done\ntheir homework knew that it was not a\nlong climb and it was just a a punchy\neffort just to get over into another\ndescent. And I knew that we went to the\nvalley floor ahead of around 20 miles\nand and this was the point where I knew\nto kick and chase back on and try and\nstay with a group. And that fortunately\nhappened because I didn't want to lose\nany time if I didn't have to. And if I\ncould ride smart in the wheels, then\nthat was the the main aim of the game,\nespecially on these tarmac sections\nwhere I'm a bit more familiar. And then\nit was going onto a valley floor of\nsort of around 10 miles on gravel path.\nSo I knew if I could be within a group,\nit would really help up until the first\nfeed zone. And that was the plan and\nthat's how it played out. I actually\npulled a few turns on the valley floor.\nI wanted to make sure that for the 10\nmiles people knew I was willing to work\nup until the first feed zone. And then\nit was my turn to stop at the feed feed\nzone and stock up ready for the long\nclimb. I didn't have any support out on\nthe road. So, you know, it was really\nimportant that I maintained good fueling\nand hydration for the day, especially\nwith the heat to come. I did take note\nof the rider in front of me here with\nthe bladder on his back, but I've tried\nthat in the past and it actually gave me\nback issues when climbing. So, I decided\ntoday that it was going to be a stop at\nthe feed zones instead of carrying a\nbackpack with me. Let me know what your\npreference would be here.\nIt's an absolute legend. Just had a\nsprayer on at the bottom of the long\nclimb.\nAnd this is where I'm going to pause\nthis video. That sprayer\nbroke my Insta 360 for the whole\nweekend. There was me calling him a\nlegend and I had no more footage for the\nrest of the weekend other than like\nevery time I tried to stop my Insta 360.\nWhen I got back to download them, I had\na series of 1 second clips and then it\nwould go and I didn't realize. But back\nto the video.\nIt's warming up.\nTwo hours in. Uh, pretty much the bottom\nof the main climb now. So, steady tempo\nto the top.\nPlan is to find a realistic tempo now\nfor best part of two hours.\nUh, but so far absolutely loved it. like\nno pressure\non myself. Just tried to follow a few\nmoves on the flat and run my own pace on\nthe climb. So, just really enjoying it.\nBut look at this. I think for someone\nwho's not great on gravel, this course\nis brilliant because it's pretty much\n50/50 paved road and gravel. First climb\nwas savage though, but you come to\nexpect that. So, I started recording\nhere because it was immediately after\nthe first feed zone and I could just see\nthe rides in front of me that I was with\nbefore. Um, and then coming into like\nthe main off-road climb\nfinisher.\nYou can tell by the noise.\nDominic\nright underneath.\nJust a great great day out. Absolutely\nbrilliant day out. finished the time of\n4:43 I think. Um\nand it's\n50 km climb to the finish pretty much.\nIt was madam\nbut yeah\nvery enjoyable. Very proud of the bike.\nwent well and uh\nyeah\nto recover for tomorrow. Now\nWas\nnot expecting that,\nbut\nvery very pleased. Out of the whole\nweekend, this was the one that I just\nwanted to come and have bit of fun with.\nIt's just funny how it goes, isn't it?\nPut a lot more pressure on myself last\nnight,\nblew up. today. Just rode my own pace.\nCome away with a medal.\nSo, just cutting back\nand here is the medal for qualification\nfor the 35 to 39 year old\ngravel worlds in Holland. And that was\nme saying I had no aspirations to ride\nit and just didn't really know what to\nexpect\num or what to target really. And one of\nthe difficulties on the day was\nnutrition because the aim was to be as\nlightweight as possible the night\nbefore, which was like\nfinishing at around 6:00 in the evening\nand then being fueled for two long days\non the gravel and then the road. Um, so\nsort of halfway through the gravel ride,\nI just couldn't consume any more gels or\nanything. And yeah, I I did struggle\nwith with food a little bit, but to the\npoint of the last video, there was there\nwas another sort of 20 miles\nuphillish and the main elevation had\nbeen done, but then it was like\nundulating and I knew the parkour from\nthe map that I had on my stem and I just\ndecided that it was going to be\na case of survival to the finish and try\nand eat when I could. But I've never\nreally experienced that and would be\ninterested to know sort of you know any\nof your experiences of having to fuel\nfor such an event and like a multi-day\nevent was really really difficult\nactually and um like people that know me\nwill will know that I don't have a\nproblem eating at any time and I think\njust a over consumption of carbohydrates\nin such a short space of time was quite\ndifficult. But overall result was very\npleasing. I'll be honest, I didn't\nexpect it. I just rode my own tempo for\nthe whole for the whole day. And I kind\nof had a target to go sub five hours.\nSo, I was really pleased with the time\nand as an event, if you are new to\ngravel riding and you enjoy climbing,\nhighly recommend it. If you're an\nexperienced gravel rider who wants\ntechnical gravel\non sort of like a, you know, a diverse\nterrain, I don't think this is the one\nfor you. I really enjoyed the technical\nclims. The descent, the main descent was\na road descent and then it was back onto\na very long climb on and off the coal\nroad. Um and then around the colder croy\nfry for the sort of the final section\nwhich was steep up hills and like very\nshort downhill so it's like a elevation\nin steps and I think like I said it\nsuited me but\nnot one for those who are looking for\nout and out gravel and also those\nprobably that are looking to race in\nHolland in in the World Champs. You\nknow, those that are going to be\ntargeting the event aren't going to be\nlooking for that type of um that that\ntype of parkour. Where does it leave me?\nStill exactly the same. It is slapbang\nin the middle of UK hill climb season. I\nwon't be taking a trip to Holland to\nride a flat gravel course with thousands\nof people and risking\num that season that has been built\naround Matt Lock at the end of October.\nSo,\nthank you for the medal. I'll probably\ngo next year, but you won't be seeing me\nin Holland. If you haven't seen the time\ntrial event the night before, please\ncheck out the video.\nCan\nI make this to\ntomorrow? Check in for episode three of\nthree of the Grand Fondo road race.\nCheers.",
