        "explanation": "Worthington Park in downtown Quilcene provides small-town race base with post-race hot food and beer garden. Peak rhododendron bloom creates scenic forest backdrop.

Post-race awards ceremony and door prizes create gathering atmosphere. Small-town hospitality reputation and Eleven Winery sponsorship since year one show local commitment."
      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "400 riders maximum across three distances and nine age/gender categories means thin competitive fields. Awards 3 deep in all categories including separate non-competitive gran fondo and e-bike divisions. No course records or notable times mentioned despite chip timing."

Juniors race for $35, and $5 series discount for bundling with Why-Not-Chee adds value. Support level justifies pricing for Olympic Peninsula adventure."
