Limited 400-rider field helps organization but navigation prep becomes mandatory."
      },
      "length": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Ted King took \"approaching two hours\" to climb Bon Jon Pass, with \"most of the climbing done by the half-way point\" before \"motoring to the finish line.\" The 2024 long course was shortened from 80 to 55 miles due to severe weather, showing distance flexibility when conditions demand it."
      },
      "technicality": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "King describes \"a rough double-track section around mile 25\" as \"a 4x4 track\" with \"plenty of whoops and dips\" over \"nearly three rough miles.\" The technical challenge peaks on \"screaming fast descents with wheel-eating potholes which would end your day badly if you weren't paying close attention.\""
      },
      "elevation": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "The Bon Jon Pass climb gains 4,000 feet from sea level in a sustained effort that King calls \"just so long!\" The long course forces riders to \"climb Bon Jon again\" - hitting the pass twice. King set his \"best 60-minute power for the year\" on the opening climb that \"shredded the peloton to just four riders.\""
      },
      "climate": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Weather varies dramatically from \"showers and even sleet\" in 2024 to \"good conditions\" in 2025, though riders still faced \"cloud and fog at high elevations.\" King experienced \"cold fingers\" affecting bike handling, while elevation changes create \"an entirely different climate\" requiring careful clothing strategy for the 4,000-foot elevation range."
      },
      "altitude": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Starting from Quilcene at sea level and topping out \"a bit shy of 4,000 feet\" on Bon Jon Pass means zero altitude considerations. This is pure climbing volume without thin air effects."
      },
      "adventure": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "King describes reaching \"a remote valley in the far reaches of the course, which was bucolic and just stunning\" where he and his companion \"were both shivering from the long cold descent.\" Zero cell coverage adds isolation factor, while June timing hits peak rhododendron blooms \"spotlighted against the deep green background of the forest.\""
      },
      "prestige": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Ted King acknowledges \"the field wasn't huge at Bon Jon Pass Out\" in this 400-rider regional event. King calls it \"very grassroots\" with \"no showiness to this event, just people out having a good time on two wheels.\" Limited to Pacific Northwest appeal despite quality organization."
      },
      "race_quality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Close finishes show competitive depth - the long course was \"decided by just a few seconds\" with winner Tyler Klansnic beating Ben Shauland by two seconds after nearly five hours. Aid stations and mechanical support cover basics, though weather forced course modification in 2024 from 80 to 55 miles."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Jan Heine found \"just the right combination of professional organization and down-to-earth vibe\" that \"felt like racing way back, when cycling was a tiny sport.\" King stayed \"literally about 20 steps from the back door\" to the start line at Worthington mansion, with post-race \"hot food, beer garden, and awards\" maintaining small-town atmosphere."
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Heine describes the welcoming atmosphere: \"you just assumed that anybody showing up was a friend, or would become one.\" Organizers Lorrie and Buck bring \"infectious enthusiasm,\" while proceeds benefit Quilcene Historical Museum. King notes the \"common thread to gravel riders\" creating grassroots camaraderie without pretension."
      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "King's early breakaway of \"just four riders taking pulls\" after twenty minutes shows how quickly the field splits on Bon Jon Pass. With 400 riders across three distances and multiple age groups, competitive depth stays thin despite quality like King's presence and close elite finishes."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "$60-80 entry fees include RFID timing that delivered a two-second photo finish after five hours, aid stations with mechanical support, and post-race food. King consumed \"all of my nutrition and never wanted more or less\" from on-course support. Proceeds support local nonprofits adding community value beyond racing."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "King's accommodation at \"the historic Worthington mansion\" put him \"20 steps\" from the start line, while camping options keep costs down. Quilcene location avoids resort pricing while staying accessible from Seattle metro without flight requirements."
