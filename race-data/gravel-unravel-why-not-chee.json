The Olympic National Forest setting is legit, but prestige requires history and recognition this race hasn't earned yet."

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "They've got the basics covered—aid stations every 6-15 miles, medical support, post-race beer garden. But self-navigation with markings that \"may fail in rain\" screams corner-cutting on course management. Four distance options and staggered starts show thought, but limited mechanical support means you're on your own when things break."

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Wynoochee Lake through towering evergreens and moss-covered forest roads delivers on scenery. 90-99% gravel depending on distance gives you the surface you came for. But no standout features, named climbs, or memorable sections that riders talk about afterward—just pleasant miles through pretty trees."

      "community": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "400-rider cap keeps it intimate, and the bundle discount with Bon Jon suggests they're building something. Post-race beer garden and multiple categories from juniors to super masters shows inclusivity. But zero evidence of actual community—no rider quotes, no forum buzz, no indication this builds lasting connections."

        "score": 1,

        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "$70-80 entry for 42-78 miles with multiple aid stations, post-race food, and beer is reasonable for the region. $5 bundle discount with Bon Jon adds value if you're doing the series. No prize purse keeps costs down, and the Olympic Peninsula setting delivers legitimate adventure per dollar."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Entry fees max at $80 for the long course, which won't break anyone. Hoquiam isn't a destination that gouges on lodging, and Satsop Center parking is free roadside. Two hours from Seattle-Tacoma airport means manageable travel costs if you're flying in."
      },
      "length": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "42 miles sits in that middle distance no-man's land—not punchy enough for criterium types, not epic enough for ultra endurance riders. The 77-mile long option adds substance, but most will choose the medium and finish wondering if they should have gone longer."
      },
      "technicality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "\"Endurance-focused gravel roads\" means fire roads and logging routes, not technical descents or rock gardens. 97-99% gravel eliminates pavement but also singletrack challenge. Suitable for cross bikes tells you the technical demands are minimal."
      },
      "elevation": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "5,800 feet over 42 miles averages to gentle rollers, not sustained climbing. The 10,300-foot long course has more bite, but spread over 77 miles it's still not punishing. Olympic Peninsula topography doesn't deliver the lung-searing walls that separate racers."
      },
      "climate": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Late July in coastal Washington usually means mild temps in the 60-75°F range, but the Pacific Northwest's reputation for surprise rain is real. Course markings that \"may fail in weather\" suggest organizers know conditions can turn, but they're not preparing you for it."
      },
      "altitude": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Starting from Hoquiam at sea level and climbing through low-elevation forest roads means zero altitude impact. Even 10,300 feet of cumulative gain doesn't put you high enough for thin air. Your legs might burn, but your lungs won't notice."
      },
      "logistics": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Roadside parking with volunteer direction sounds improvised, and \"pre-race email for details\" means they're winging the communication. Four staggered start times between 7:30-9:00 AM shows organization, but self-navigation requirements dump responsibility on riders when course support should handle it."
      },
      "adventure": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Olympic National Forest delivers legitimate wilderness vibes with towering evergreens and vivid moss covering everything. Wynoochee Lake provides scenic payoff, and 99% gravel on the long course gets you properly remote. Self-navigation adds legitimate adventure factor, even if it's poor race management."
