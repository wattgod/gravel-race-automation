        "explanation": "The 2026 format creates a 23-mile loop with \"just under 2,000' of climbing per lap\" where everyone starts at 9:30 AM regardless of distance. Ted King spent \"approaching two hours\" spinning up the first climb \"all the way from sea level\" to nearly 4,000 feet, capturing the sustained nature of Olympic Peninsula terrain."
      },

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "The course is \"approximately 95% gravel\" with \"wheel-eating potholes which would end your day badly if you weren't paying close attention,\" according to pro cyclist Ted King. ACree favors a 29er hardtail over gravel bikes here, noting \"there is enough very rough gravel\" despite the 40mm minimum tire recommendation."

      "elevation": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "The Big Creek Loop around Mount Fitzgerald delivers steady Olympic National Forest climbing through \"older growth forest offering pristine views.\" With \"just under 2,000' of climbing per lap\" in the new loop format, it's consistent work without the punishing gradients that would fragment the field significantly."
      },
      "climate": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "The 2025 race ran \"in cloud and fog at high elevations\" with variable conditions across years: \"some races have been held in deluges and in one year, it was held in the middle of the worst heat wave in the Pacific Northwest in 100 years.\" The remote Olympic Peninsula location amplifies any weather complications riders face."
      },
      "altitude": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Starting from sea-level Hoquiam and climbing through low-elevation forest roads means zero altitude impact. Even Ted King's climb to \"a bit shy of 4,000 feet\" represents cumulative gain rather than sustained high elevation that would affect performance or recovery."
      },
      "adventure": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Riders experience \"the children of giants (Hemlock, Spruce, Douglas Fir, Western Red Cedar)\" around Wynoochee Lake, including one mile of Maidenhair Falls Trail singletrack. The area represents \"some of the deepest logging roots in the state\" and ancestral Chehalis lands, with the race earning the title \"the most epic race you've never heard about.\""

      "prestige": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "broshaughnessy's approach captures the hierarchy perfectly: \"Using this as a training race for Gran Fondo Winthrop in September.\" Despite Ted King's praise for the challenge, ACree skipped despite endorsing the promoter, suggesting it sits below the region's premier events in gravel calendars."
      },
      "race_quality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "The event provides \"RFID timing, a well-marked course, on-course snacks and medical support\" with post-race food and beer garden. Ted King observed \"There's no showiness to this event, just people out having a good time on two wheels,\" capturing the competent but understated execution."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "The \"peaceful, lush and green\" Big Creek Loop delivers the towering evergreens and moss-covered terrain riders expect from the Olympic Peninsula. Ted King was \"blown away by the challenge\" of the sustained climbing, while the loop format means \"friends and family can see you and cheer you on\" between laps."
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "The mandatory camping culture defines the experience: \"There's no trouble finding accommodations...just bring a tent.\" With 20% female participation and race fees covering hauled-in water plus post-race meals, Ted King notes the inclusive atmosphere where \"seasoned racers mingle with riders who've never contemplated putting a power meter on their bikes.\""
      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "broshaughnessy's 282W FTP (3.79 W/kg) represents solid competitive level, while zkravey plans the course on a Domane with 35mm tires below the 40mm recommendation. The 400-rider cap and medals for age group winners suggests broad participation rather than concentrated talent."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Entry fees from $60-80 include timing, aid stations, medical support, and post-race meals, with \"part of the race fee pays for the organizers to haul in water\" and lunch. Free dispersed camping on National Forest land plus the remote Olympic Peninsula setting deliver strong adventure value per dollar."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Maximum $80 entry won't strain budgets, and mandatory camping keeps accommodation costs minimal with free dispersed options on National Forest land. The remote Olympic Peninsula location lacks destination pricing, while Coho Campground provides RV options just 3.5 miles from Race Central for traditional campground preferences."
