Carey Lowery experienced a navigational error that \"cost me 60 minutes and gave me 17 bonus miles,\" highlighting route-finding challenges. Two official checkpoints provide basic support, though the 15.5-hour cutoff proved unforgiving in 2024 when only 97 of 150 starters finished within time."

I was over an hour behind last year's time.\" His mental approach at \"miles 80-100 were the hardest for me, as I was beginning to tire from the monotony\" captures how this distance breaks riders through sheer persistence rather than single epic moments. Among the longest in gravel, comparable to Badlands."

        "explanation": "Nebraska's \"small pea gravel/sand mixture\" becomes treacherous when wet—Lowery described hitting B-roads around mile 70: \"I felt like I was on a single track ribbon of dark chocolate. There was a 18 inch wide path of firm ground on this road, but to either side it was sticky mud.\" The gravel \"soaked it up like a sponge\" rather than shedding water like other regions. Similar technical demands to SBT GRVL."

        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "The 10,000 feet over 150 miles creates what one veteran described as \"intervals for 4 hours straight\"—87 relentless rollers through Nebraska's drainage hills. These constant power surges through rolling farmland prove harder than single big climbs, as riders are either climbing or descending with virtually no recovery flats to settle into rhythm. Similar elevation profile to Almanzo 100."

The combination of mud, then sun and humidity as \"roads were still sludge\" demonstrates how prairie weather can compound suffering. Among the most weather-friendly events, easier than Badlands."

Lower altitude than The Mid South — no thin-air concerns."
