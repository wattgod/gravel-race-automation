The 2025 event maintained all start times despite challenging weather, showing solid contingency planning, though basic lodging and travel information remains sparse."

        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "The 135km course with 1,892m climbing delivered proper gravel distance—elite winner Brendan Johnston finished in 3:46:57, winning by just 3 seconds over Mark O'Brien. Multiple distance options (95km, 50km) accommodate different abilities without diluting the main event's challenge. Similar distance to Crusher in the Tushar."
      },
      "technicality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "This is 83% quality gravel on wide open roads through farmland, not technical singletrack. The 1km Wicket Hill Climb at 11% average grade is described as 'the crux of the course,' but it's power over bike handling skills that determines outcomes on these mostly rolling roads. Less technical than The Mid South."
      },
      "elevation": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "The 1,892m of climbing over 135km keeps riders working without being mountainous. Wicket Hill's 125m gain hits twice in the long course, and elevation ranging from 155m to 520m provides constant undulation. Enough to separate the field but favors fitness over pure climbing specialists. Less climbing than The Mid South."
      },
      "climate": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Late October typically offers ideal spring conditions, but 2025 showed weather's wild side. Race organizers described it bluntly: 'NO BLUE SKIES. NO DUST. NO WARMTH. Just rain. Cold. And heart.' The challenging conditions 'soaked riders to the bone' but the event proceeded as scheduled. Similar climate challenges to SBT GRVL."
      },
      "altitude": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Starting around 155m and maxing at 520m means zero altitude considerations. This is essentially sea level for performance—no acclimatization needed, no training benefit, just normal oxygen levels throughout the Goulburn Valley terrain. Lower altitude than Gravel Worlds — no thin-air concerns."
      },
      "adventure": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "The course winds through rolling farmlands with Strathbogie Ranges vistas, reaching Wallaby Gully Flora Reserve at the highest point. Organizers call it 'some of the finest, fastest & least-known gravel in the country,' delivering countryside exploration without manufactured adventure."
      },
      "prestige": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Being the first UCI Gravel World Series qualifier worldwide for 2025 should elevate status, but the race remains relatively unknown despite over 500 participants. Matt Bird's crash report mentions hoping for 'something more exciting than a ripped skinsuit and bruised ego' at his 'first little gravel event.'"
      },
      "race_quality": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "The course delivers with 83% quality gravel and strategic design—Wicket Hill Climb creates selection points at 30km and 73km. The 2025 edition proved its mettle when challenging weather turned it into 'a test of grit, courage, and sheer determination' that riders won't forget."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "You're riding through Australian countryside with Strathbogie Ranges vistas that actually matter. Starting and finishing at Seymour Racecourse gives it proper event feel, and the two-loop format means spectators can see you suffer twice. The terrain from 155m to 520m elevation keeps the scenery changing, though the experience caps out at 'very pleasant' rather than life-changing."
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "The event welcomes everyone from 'UCI Age Category podium' chasers to those wanting to 'roll with mates,' with over 500 participants and growing. E-bikes are 'welcome, and encouraged' in recreational categories. Despite 2025's brutal weather, organizers thanked Seymour's warmth that 'shone through.'"
      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Over 500 riders creates decent competition across age groups, with UCI qualification drawing serious amateurs. Brendan Johnston's repeat victory and 3-second winning margin shows quality at the front, though the field lacks international depth beyond Oceania talent like 2025 NZ Cyclocross Champion Sharlotte Lucas. Less competitive depth than Almanzo 100."
      },

        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "$215 AUD entry includes 135km of quality gravel, aid stations, and UCI Worlds qualification opportunity for top 25% finishers. The event village offers 'fine food & drink, local produce' plus $30 camping for six people maximum—reasonable pricing for a qualifier event."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Registration runs $100-150 AUD. Getting to Seymour, Victoria means expensive international flights and costly domestic Australian travel. Limited accommodation details beyond Seymour being a 'hidden gem' suggests tight lodging options. Add bike shipping and rental cars, and total costs mount quickly for this relatively small event. More expensive than Atlas Mountain Race."

          "transcript": "[Music]\nall right welcome to Sunny Seymour this\nsmall farming Town hosted gravista 2024\nat the race course my friend Sean came\nalong with me how you feeling this\nmorning\nH uh yeah\num I've been sick last few days so\nthat's been a bit crummy but I'm feeling\nbetter now and I'm hoping to do all\nright and Master's age 40 to 44 age\ngroup um yeah I think it's going to be\nreally fun out there looks really pretty\nthe course I've seen lots of photos and\nWy haven't done one myself but yeah it\nwas looks really nice so I'm looking\nforward to it nice one smash it so the\ncourse started at sey more Race Course\nheaded out over wickets Hill which is\nthe only real major climb in this course\nand then it did a big loop the 136k\nRiders did it twice and the 95k Riders\ndid it once then it headed back down to\nSeymour race course so it was time for\nme to start the race and I got a pretty\ngood position at the start line uh and\nthen as the bunch kind of rolled out I\nworked my way\nthrough we will neutralize then on the\ntarmac on one of the main roads out of\nSE race course for a while while until\nwe hit the gravel and then it was all on\nas you can see here I'm at the front of\nthe bunch because I knew in about 500 M\nthere was a creek crossing coming up\njust here I wanted to pick my line\nthrough this but it ended up just\nsending it straight through the middle\nanyway so that was a bit of a wasted\neffort I didn't spend too many matches\ntrying to get into that position then we\nkind of rolled up out of there um and\nsome stronger guys were kind of towards\nthe front went through a really big\nmuddy puddle which I un fortunately\nmissed I was tooo worried about my\nposition one thing I learned from the\ndirty Docker ride is to stay towards the\nfront of the group at the start so\nyou're rolling with those faster wheels\nand you have a good chance of actually\nsticking with them throughout the day\nand watch out here's Dave from the dirty\nDocker Ride video he actually finished\nuh first in his age group so congrats\nDave good job mate heading out to the\nmain Loop uh we were on and off the TAC\nbut eventually settled into the gravel\nand I identified Shannon Scott here\nright in front of me in the SNP hit s\nSMP bibs he was going to be my main\ncompetitor I think for the day um so\nwhen he kind of moved forward here and\neven started to go off the front I\nreally wanted to follow him there was a\nfew attempts at breakaways um early on\nand I was involved in pretty much all of\nthem um you can see Chris jungle Ward uh\nsends a flyer right here none of us\nreally wanted to attack that straight\naway but a group of us some stronger\nRiders kind of gradually brought him\nback um and we all kind of came came\nback together again there was another\nmoment where I went off the front with a\nwhole bunch of guys who were from a\ndifferent age category I think this is\nit here um and I think my presence um\ncaused the whole rest of the Pelon to\nkind of Chase up because they didn't\nwant yet another age group Rider in that\nmix if they were all from the same age\ngroup they might have stayed away but uh\nyeah sorry guys so yeah we're rolling\npretty fast here as you can see and we\nare coming in to start the main Loop\nthis is a really sketchy Bridge Crossing\nthat you can see it kind of Narrows here\nand Chris jungle war just sends a fly\nthrough there that's cool um and this is\nkind of starting onto the loop now\nthere's a little Pinchy climb here\nbefore the the main climb of wicket Hill\nbut look at this scenery just absolutely\nstunning um this is what gravel racing\nis all about and by this point um I was\nhaving so much fun I was like this is\ngreat I'm in a good position with a good\nbunch of dudes this is going to be a\nreally fun day out um I was feeling good\nafter having been sick for the last few\ndays and there's Dave again he's really\nreally strong on the climbs so then we\nstarted the wicked Hill Climb so again\nthis is the only real major climb in the\ncourse and it's at the start pretty much\nof the loop so an attack here isn't\nnecessarily going to be decisive I\nstarted towards the front of the group\nhere and started to drift back a little\nbit as some stronger writers started to\ncome through there's Gregory Thorn some\nof you may know him um but yeah I was\nkind of hurting pretty bad here and this\nwas another age group category riter um\nthat was in front of me so he was the\nsecond so right now I'm third on the\nroad in my in my age category and I was\nreally really Keen to hold his will to\nmake sure that I could stay in this\ngroup coming down over the climb and I\npretty much managed to do that he's\nthere he is right there so felt like I\nwas still kind of in the mix in with a\nreally good shot this is the very front\nof the race pretty much here you can see\nthe front rer there and yeah I felt like\nI was good but I was really on the limit\nhere I was like just hammering down this\nhill and pretty much desperate to do\nanything just stay with the group and\nthen boom right there is when I smacked\nmy rear reel really really hard on a\nrock and it was pretty much race over\nbecause I there's no way I was going to\nbe able to fix a flat I put a spare tube\nin but that just went down straight\naway uh I don't really know what to do\nnow my spar's now blown and I don't know\nwhere the aid station is the nearest\none yeah and suddenly found myself\nstranded because the aid stations were\nso far away and thank God this car came\nalong and I hailed them down I was I\nasked them if they had a a tube and they\nonly really had a pump but you know it\nwas it was game over for my day anyway\nthere was no way the the tire was going\nto stay up so I jumped in the car headed\nback to the Village had some lunch and\nrealized that yeah okay I've had a bad\nday but there's always people worse off\num so you know I was thankful for that\ngood thing was I was able to catch the\nend of the elite men's race here's\nBrandon Johnson or treky finishing first\nand here's my interview with him oh and\nthanks Beck Henderson for helping me out\nwith this one out there today it was\ngood it was fast uh I I don't know it\nwas so coming up and taking third on the\nday\ntoday 14 Bridge Lane Luke Burns welld\nRider number 33 but in the first laay\nthe three of us luk number 46 one of our\nage group Riders just in behind just\nreally well for the the next whole lap\nso this is a race for some of the minor\nplacing I can see Marco Bran's on the\nback of that group there uh we actually\nlost him on the way back in a climb and\nthen big big sprint coming up towards\nthe line yeah I mean\nvery well done to go I just had to try\ntry 2 how well he finishes so uh I\ndidn't want to leave it to J just ahead\nof Joel green and Mar oen so their\nRiders very good guys went clear after\nthe CL yeah uh wck Hill Road or whatever\nuh yeah there the first lap there was\nthree of us over the top um and we just\npushed on and worked really well\ntogether using some of the that recently\ntook him to theel World Championships\nthere to win\nthat come back so it was a good group\nyeah nice well congrats BR\nthanks Mark way what happened uh dropped\nthe chain just before the first climb\nand um managed to bridge back through\neveryone got to within 30 m of the front\nthr and Trey Let It Off on a descent I\nnever quite got there\nso what you finish like\nFifth Fifth six it's all the same if\nyou're not\nwinning punch it's been punched\npunch Rock\nsection\nSor T you got or six\ncongratulations that's amazing thank you\nhow' it go um it was so hard but really\nfun um we yeah as soon as the uh men's\nage group came past the girls jumped on\nand it got pretty heated from then on so\num we had a pretty strong and huge Bunch\ngoing through the first Loop um and up\nthat big climb and then held on and my\ngoal was to just like honestly stay with\nmy friend Courtney if I could um and\nstay with the bunch as long as possible\num I got to the well just before the\nsecond climb and I was starting to cramp\nand I was like oh no this is going to be\na bit of a battle um and then yeah the\nthat CL I was just it was a a dance\nbetween how much power can I put down\nwithout cramping and I just slowly\nwatched the bunch distance me and um\nsadly couldn't get back on so then just\nspend the rest of the time trying to\nkeep the pace up so no one could come\nback towards me but um yeah couldn't get\nback onto the group um but yeah happy to\ncome home and six even though it was\nvery painful the whole time yeah and did\nyou have enough water like it was pretty\nhot out there yeah um I've been working\non my Nutrition a bit recently so I've I\nhad a camel back and I had two biddens\num I don't think I completely emptied it\nso I and I was yeah saying hi do it the\nwhole time so many gels gels did you\nhave stuff in your bottle as well like\nyeah mixed in my bottles this um Soul\nNutrition oh yeah um so both my bottles\nand then just water in the camel pack\nand nice yeah and you so you you're in\ngroups and you were racing amongst the\nmen yeah yeah which um yeah like it's\nnot the greatest that the the women's\nrace gets so heavily influenced as soon\nas the men's like come through but um I\nguess it is what it is it's kind of hard\nto avoid at\ntimes and yeah like a few of the girls\nsnuck away and you couldn't couldn't\nfind them but that's part of it and it\nwas me it made some hard racing and um\nlike I'm pretty pretty new to racing at\nthat level and I was honestly stoked to\nhang on for as long as I did and yeah\nlearned a lot and we'll keep learning\nYay good job thanks you to go yeah okay\num it was pretty cruy at the start but\nthen as soon as we got taught by the or\nmen field I think that's when\nit that first time was pretty tough but\nI managed\nI the\nthir 100 and\nthen lost a bottle about 10K in so I had\none bottle for the whole day which was a\nbit\nrough but yeah it was a good day\nand and a bit of everything so yeah\noverall pretty good so you so you get\nthe whole course on one bottle yeah\nI bottle so I was like you had\n100 but yeah I snag a bottle off anyone\nelse\nso I could and there was no stopping

          "description": "Today’s ride takes me out of Melbourne and into the rural town of Seymour, Victoria, because in just 3 weeks time the 2025 UCI Gravel World Series begins with Gravelista, and I wanted to see if my legs are up for it.\n\nThis isn’t your Sunday coffee shop ride, this is Australia’s golden ticket to the 2026 UCI Gravel World Championships in Nannup, WA, and the course is about as forgiving as a magpie in swooping season.\n\nMy video kicks off just before Wickets Hill Road at Hughes Creek, jumping straight into the heart of the 135km and 95km Gravelista routes. With 82% gravel, rolling climbs, and fast open roads, the course is the perfect mix of punishment and fun. The main event? The infamous Wicket Hill Climb, 1km, averaging 11%, with 125m of gain. Short, sharp, savage… like a spicy meat pie fresh from the servo microwave.\n\nAlong the way you get farm tracks, the Wallaby Gully Flora Reserve and some relief on the sealed sections, and enough dust to keep the local laundromat in business. Feed zones might save you, but only if you pace smarter than your ego.\n\nIf you’re hunting Melbourne gravel rides, UCI Gravel World Series, or Victoria cycling routes, this course preview dishes it all up, minus the post-ride bbq.\n\nRoute: https://ridewithgps.com/routes/52398087 (135km)\nBike: https://youtu.be/D0SFrHfkPhI\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/11thwombat/\n\n#gravelcycling #gravelbike #gravelride #bike #cycling #roadcycling #cyclinglife #bikelife #melbournecycling #11thwombat \n\nChapters ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ\n00:42 Wickets Hill Climb / Feed station # 1, 3 & 5\n06:18 Fowles Winery / Feed station # 2 & 4",

          "transcript": "Gravel racing is brutal, but defending a\ntitle, that's legendary.\nBrendan Johnston just proved it's\npossible, while Charotte Lucas sees\nvictory in the elite women's race at\nGravilista.\nBut the real story isn't just about\nwinning. It's about the grit, the\nstrategy, and the sheer determination it\ntakes to conquer these grueling courses.\nLet's dive into the details of this\nAustralian round of the UCI Gravel World\nSeries held in Seymour, Victoria, and\nwhat made these wins so remarkable. Just\na week after securing a solid ninth\nplace at the Lifetime Grand Prix's Big\nSugar Classic in Arkansas, Brendan\nJohnston, giant SRAMM, returned to his\nfamiliar stomping grounds, laser focused\non defending his Gravilista title. The\n135 km course was a true test of\nendurance and tactical prowess with\nJohnston ultimately fending off a fierce\nchallenge from Australian gravel\nchampion Mark O'Brien. The margin of\nvictory, a mere 3 seconds. Johnston\ncrossed the finish line in a blistering\n3 hours 46 minutes and 57 seconds, a\ntestament to his unwavering commitment.\nKevin Biffiger followed in third, 1\nminute and 16 seconds behind Johnston\nwith Tasmin close behind a further 19\nseconds a drift in fourth place. The\ncompetition was fierce, showcasing the\ndepth of talent in the men's elite\nfield. And this is the part most people\nmiss. Gravel racing isn't just about\npower. It's about navigating\nunpredictable terrain, making\nsplit-second decisions, and enduring\nconditions that can change in an\ninstant.\nJohnston's ability to anticipate\nO'Brien's moves and maintain that razor\nthin lead speaks volumes about his\nexperience and mental fortitude. On the\nwomen's side, Charlotte Lucas live\nclaimed the elite women's title with an\nimpressive performance, finishing in 4\nhours 41 minutes and 1 second. Sophie\nBurn secured second place, trailing\nLucas by 3 minutes and 21 seconds. Ella\nBlur rounded out the podium in third,\nfinishing 7 minutes and 23 seconds\nbehind the leader. Carla Bell was hot on\nher heels, finishing only 1 second\nbehind in fourth place. Brianna Samuel\nfinished fifth, 12 minutes and 6 seconds\nbehind Lucas with Juliet Hado in sixth\nand Britney Kerr in seventh. Jessica\nPratt unfortunately did not finish the\nrace. Here's a thought. Does the\nrelatively small time gap between\nJohnston and O'Brien suggest that course\nfamiliarity played a significant role in\nthe men's race? Or was it purely a\nmatter of superior strategy and\nexecution in the final moments? It's\ndefinitely something to consider,\nespecially given Johnston's experience\non the course.

Brendan\nJohnston, a giant SRAMM rider, proved\nhis dominance once again, securing the\nelite men's title for the second time.\nBut the rail story lies in the narrow\nmargin of victory. Johnston, fresh from\na top 10 finish at the lifetime Grand\nPrix, faced a fierce challenge from\nAustralian champion Mark O'Brien on his\nhome turf. In a thrilling race, Johnston\nemerged triumphant, crossing the finish\nline a mere 3 seconds ahead of O'Brien.\nKevin Biffer completed the podium 1\nminute and 16 seconds behind with Tasmin\nin fourth. The elite women's race saw\nCharlatee Lucas of Liv take the top step\non the podium, showcasing her prowess in\nthe 135 km course. She finished in 4\nhours 41 minutes and 1 second with\nSophie Burn and Ella Blur rounding out\nthe top three. But here's where it gets\nintriguing. The women's race had a\nlarger time gap between the winner and\nsecond place, raising questions about\nthe depth of the women's field. Is this\na one-off or a trend worth exploring\nfurther? The Graalista event, part of\nthe UCI Gravel World Series, offered a\nthrilling showcase of talent and\nstrategy. And this is just the\nbeginning. With the series gaining\npopularity, we can expect more dramatic\nraces and rising stars. But what do you\nthink? Are gravel races the future of\ncycling or a passing fad? Share your\nthoughts and let's spark a conversation.",
