The Cannon Valley Fairgrounds venue provides a horse race track start and finish area with cowbell celebrations, food trucks, and music. However, 50 miles from MSP airport means reasonable but not convenient travel access."

        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "The 62-mile distance sits in gravel's sweet spot - long enough for meaningful suffering without the multi-day recovery of the ultra distances. Paul Palecek and his partner \"rode our ride and never separated the entire 70 miles\" (with wrong turns included), suggesting the distance allows for social riding while still testing fitness and pacing decisions. Similar distance to Crusher in the Tushar."
      },
      "technicality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Elite riders describe \"limestone gravel, and LOTS of rollers\" through the driftless region terrain. The course features \"rolling climbs and fast descents\" with navigation challenges - Paul Palecek took \"about a mile's worth of wrong turns\" on his route. Technical difficulty comes from route-finding rather than bike handling skills. Less technical than The Mid South."
      },
      "elevation": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "The course gains elevation by \"dropping in and out of the canyons along the Mississippi River valley,\" creating rolling hill patterns rather than sustained climbs. One elite rider noted the climbs \"near Frontenac are not something I went out of my way to climb,\" suggesting manageable but noticeable elevation changes throughout the driftless region. Less climbing than The Mid South."
      },
      "climate": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Weather ranges from brutal to perfect depending on the year. The 2023 race saw \"cold and rain\" with \"30 mph head and cross winds that took out a lot of riders,\" while other years featured \"blue skies, perfect temps in the 60's.\" Late August timing means variable conditions from ideal to race-ending. More weather exposure than Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."
      },
      "altitude": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Southern Minnesota farmland and river valleys mean sea-level racing with zero altitude considerations. The driftless region's elevation changes are relative to local terrain, not absolute altitude that would affect breathing or performance. Lower altitude than Gravel Worlds — no thin-air concerns."
      },
      "adventure": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Pat Moore describes riding through \"a healthy mix of forest and farmland, popping in and out of the woods and occasionally riding along the Cannon River.\" The driftless region is called \"the most beautiful and most challenging in the state,\" offering scenic variety beyond typical Midwest corn-and-soybean monotony."
      },
      "prestige": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Brian Turk called completing the 333-mile distance \"the top of my lifetime accomplishments list,\" but this reflects personal achievement rather than broader recognition. The race draws regional participation without documented pro fields or notable winners that would elevate its profile beyond Minnesota gravel circles."
      },
      "race_quality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Aid stations every 55 miles support ultra-distance attempts, and the fairgrounds finish features cowbells, food trucks, and music. Riders report \"overwhelmingly positive feedback\" with organizers receiving praise for \"changing gravel cycling.\" However, navigation issues persist - wrong turns remain common even on shorter distances."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "The race philosophy emphasizes \"Ride Your Ride\" with no pacing restrictions, creating a supportive atmosphere where Paul Palecek and his partner \"talked and laughed almost the entire way.\" The horse track start and fairgrounds finish provide unique venue character, though the experience depends heavily on weather cooperation."
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Gray Duck Grit gets credit for explicit inclusivity with Non-Binary/Gender Non-Conforming categories, acknowledging gravel's 'historically male dominated' problem. It's positioned as a grassroots event drawing 'cyclists from Minnesota and beyond,' which suggests decent regional turnout. The charity component (FRASER of MN) adds purpose beyond just hammering yourself on gravel for ego points. As Northfield Community puts it: \"Northfield residents and businesses are welcoming and very bike friendly. The town of 20,000 residents still has a small town charm along with several coffee shops, eateries, and breweries for cyclist...\""

        "explanation": "With a field of 100-250 riders, elite riders like Brian Turk and Jack Reher participate, but the field lacks documented competitive depth or pro presence. The race attracts regional weekend warriors and dedicated ultra-distance riders rather than deep competitive fields that would create tactical racing or fast finishing times. Thinner field than Ouray Gravel Grinder. As Brian Turk puts it: \"This tops my lifetime accomplishments list for sure. Still not sure what made me decide to try the Gray Duck Grit 333 mile race known as the Cow, but I did.\""

        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Multiple distance options (50, 69, 111, 222, 333 miles) let riders choose their challenge level, while all proceeds support autism and mental health resources at Fraser of Minnesota. The grassroots approach keeps costs reasonable while providing meaningful aid station support and a festival atmosphere finish experience."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Registration runs $60-90. Cannon Falls sits 50 miles from Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, making flights accessible without urban pricing. The fairgrounds location likely keeps accommodation costs reasonable, though rural Minnesota limits lodging variety. Grassroots organization typically means lower entry fees compared to destination gravel events. Similar expense level to Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."
