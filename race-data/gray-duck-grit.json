The Cannon Valley Fairgrounds venue provides a horse race track start and finish area with cowbell celebrations, food trucks, and music. However, 50 miles from MSP airport means reasonable but not convenient travel access."

        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "The 62-mile distance sits in gravel's sweet spot - long enough for meaningful suffering without the multi-day recovery of the ultra distances. Paul Palecek and his partner \"rode our ride and never separated the entire 70 miles\" (with wrong turns included), suggesting the distance allows for social riding while still testing fitness and pacing decisions. Similar distance to Crusher in the Tushar."

      "technicality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Elite riders describe \"limestone gravel, and LOTS of rollers\" through the driftless region terrain. The course features \"rolling climbs and fast descents\" with navigation challenges - Paul Palecek took \"about a mile's worth of wrong turns\" on his route. Technical difficulty comes from route-finding rather than bike handling skills. Less technical than The Mid South."
      },
      "elevation": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "The course gains elevation by \"dropping in and out of the canyons along the Mississippi River valley,\" creating rolling hill patterns rather than sustained climbs. One elite rider noted the climbs \"near Frontenac are not something I went out of my way to climb,\" suggesting manageable but noticeable elevation changes throughout the driftless region. Less climbing than The Mid South."
      },
      "climate": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Weather ranges from brutal to perfect depending on the year. The 2023 race saw \"cold and rain\" with \"30 mph head and cross winds that took out a lot of riders,\" while other years featured \"blue skies, perfect temps in the 60's.\" Late August timing means variable conditions from ideal to race-ending. More weather exposure than Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."
      },
      "altitude": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Southern Minnesota farmland and river valleys mean sea-level racing with zero altitude considerations. The driftless region's elevation changes are relative to local terrain, not absolute altitude that would affect breathing or performance. Lower altitude than Gravel Worlds — no thin-air concerns."
      },
      "adventure": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Pat Moore describes riding through \"a healthy mix of forest and farmland, popping in and out of the woods and occasionally riding along the Cannon River.\" The driftless region is called \"the most beautiful and most challenging in the state,\" offering scenic variety beyond typical Midwest corn-and-soybean monotony."
      },
      "prestige": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Brian Turk called completing the 333-mile distance \"the top of my lifetime accomplishments list,\" but this reflects personal achievement rather than broader recognition. The race draws regional participation without documented pro fields or notable winners that would elevate its profile beyond Minnesota gravel circles."
      },

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Aid stations every 55 miles support ultra-distance attempts, and the fairgrounds finish features cowbells, food trucks, and music. Riders report \"overwhelmingly positive feedback\" with organizers receiving praise for \"changing gravel cycling.\" However, navigation issues persist - wrong turns remain common even on shorter distances."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "The race philosophy emphasizes \"Ride Your Ride\" with no pacing restrictions, creating a supportive atmosphere where Paul Palecek and his partner \"talked and laughed almost the entire way.\" The horse track start and fairgrounds finish provide unique venue character, though the experience depends heavily on weather cooperation."
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Gray Duck Grit gets credit for explicit inclusivity with Non-Binary/Gender Non-Conforming categories, acknowledging gravel's 'historically male dominated' problem. It's positioned as a grassroots event drawing 'cyclists from Minnesota and beyond,' which suggests decent regional turnout. The charity component (FRASER of MN) adds purpose beyond just hammering yourself on gravel for ego points. As Northfield Community puts it: \"Northfield residents and businesses are welcoming and very bike friendly. The town of 20,000 residents still has a small town charm along with several coffee shops, eateries, and breweries for cyclist...\""

        "explanation": "With a field of 100-250 riders, elite riders like Brian Turk and Jack Reher participate, but the field lacks documented competitive depth or pro presence. The race attracts regional weekend warriors and dedicated ultra-distance riders rather than deep competitive fields that would create tactical racing or fast finishing times. Thinner field than Ouray Gravel Grinder. As Brian Turk puts it: \"This tops my lifetime accomplishments list for sure. Still not sure what made me decide to try the Gray Duck Grit 333 mile race known as the Cow, but I did.\""

        "explanation": "Multiple distance options (50, 69, 111, 222, 333 miles) let riders choose their challenge level, while all proceeds support autism and mental health resources at Fraser of Minnesota. The grassroots approach keeps costs reasonable while providing meaningful aid station support and a festival atmosphere finish experience."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Registration runs $60-90. Cannon Falls sits 50 miles from Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, making flights accessible without urban pricing. The fairgrounds location likely keeps accommodation costs reasonable, though rural Minnesota limits lodging variety. Grassroots organization typically means lower entry fees compared to destination gravel events. Similar expense level to Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

Please leave ❤️❤️❤️ in the comments!)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDisclaimer: In a quaint courtyard, a man was leisurely enjoying a hot pot. The bubbling red broth emitted a rich, spicy aroma. He hummed a tune as he picked at his food, looking utterly content.\n\nJust as he was about to put a slice of fatty beef coated in chili oil into his mouth, a knock came from the direction of the main door. The sudden noise startled the man, who then put down his chopsticks and got up to go to the door.\n\nWei Wu pushed open the door, and what greeted him was a middle-aged couple. The man, dressed in coarse linen, appeared to be around fifty years old, yet his features exuded an undeniable air of nobility. The woman beside him was similarly simply dressed, her expression gentle and dignified.\n\nTheir demeanor and attire were clearly incongruous, but the moment Wei Wu saw their faces, his heart skipped a beat.\n\nHe never imagined that the aroma emanating from his hotpot would attract the attention of Emperor Zhu Yuanzhang and Empress Ma Xiuying, who were traveling incognito.\n\nOthers might have mistaken them for ordinary citizens, but Wei Wu, a scholar specializing in Ming Dynasty history, recognized them instantly.\n\nA year ago, Wei Wu was unexpectedly transported from modern times to the early Ming Dynasty, where he awakened a \"future package system.\"\n\nThis system delivered a daily package from the future to him, the contents of which were random—food, daily necessities, high-tech weapons, modern medicine, or even some unusual items.\n\nAll of this filled Wei Wu with ecstatic joy. Being able to travel to the ancient dynasty he was most fascinated by, although he lost access to the internet and electronic entertainment, had made his life more comfortable and carefree than ever before.\n\nHowever, the sudden arrival of Zhu Yuanzhang and Ma Xiuying made Wei Wu realize that this peace was about to be shattered.\n\nAfter all, his courtyard contained a large number of modern items clearly not belonging to this era, the origin of which he couldn't explain using common sense.\n\nBut a bold idea immediately took shape in Wei Wu's mind. He decided to proactively reveal his identity as someone from the future to Zhu Yuanzhang and his wife, gaining their trust.\n\nAnd using the historical memories in his mind, along with the continuous supply of resources provided by the system, he would influence the future direction of the Ming Dynasty. At the same time, he would also plan a stable and prosperous life for himself.\n\nJust as Wei Wu was considering whether to find a suitable way to explain, the middle-aged man spoke first.\n\n“Young man, my wife and I left in a hurry and forgot to bring any money. We're now starving and it's inconvenient to go back the way we came.” “We smelled the delicious aroma wafting from your courtyard and dared to come and see if we could beg for a meal.”\n\nHearing this, a strange light flashed in Wei Wu's eyes, but he smiled and pretended not to understand, replying, “Old man, you're too kind. It's just a meal; there's no need for money.”\n\n“Besides, this is the capital; who would dare to act recklessly? If you don't mind, please come in. There's still some left in the pot.”\n\nThe man's eyes flashed with approval, and he cupped his hands in thanks, saying with a smile, “Then thank you very much for your help, young man.” “You're too kind. Helping others is helping yourself.” Wei Wu smiled and stepped aside, leading the two into the courtyard.\n\nAs soon as they entered, the aroma of the red oil in the pot intensified. The middle-aged man couldn't help but stare intently at the hot pot, his Adam's apple bobbing as he swallowed several times.\nAll the story and images/graphics used in the video belong to their respective owners and I or this channel does not claim any right over them (All credits to the respected owner).\n\nCopyright Disclaimer under section 107 of the Copyright Act of 1976, allowance is made for “fair use” for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, education and research.

          "transcript": "In a quaint courtyard, a man was\nleisurely enjoying hot pot. The bubbling\nred broth in the pot emitted a rich,\nspicy aroma. He picked up some food\nwhile humming a tune, looking extremely\ncontent. Just as he was about to put the\nbeef roll covered in chili oil into his\nmouth, there was a knock at the door.\nThe sudden noise startled the man\nslightly, and he put down his chopsticks\nand got up to walk towards the door.\nWayu pushed open the door, only to be\ngreeted by a middle-aged couple. The man\ndressed in coarse linen clothes appear\nto be around 50 years old, yet his\nfeatures exuded an undeniable air of\nnobility. The woman beside him was\nsimilarly simply dressed with a gentle\nand dignified expression. The two people\nin front of him had a demeanor that was\nclearly inconsistent with their clothes,\nbut we wu suddenly shocked the moment he\nsaw their faces. He never imagined that\nthe aroma emanating from his hot pot\nwould attract Emperor Zhu Yuan Jang and\nEmpress Mashoiing who were traveling\nincognito. Others might have just seen\nthem as ordinary people, but Weii Wu, a\nscholar specializing in the history of\nthe Ming dynasty, recognized their true\nidentities at a glance. A year ago, Weii\nWu was transported from the modern era\nto the early days of the Ming dynasty\ndue to an accident and unexpectedly\nawakened the future package system.\nEvery day, the system delivers a package\nfrom the future to him. The contents are\nrandom and could be food, daily\nnecessities, high-tech weapons, modern\nmedicines, or even some special items.\nAll of this filled Wei Woo with ecstatic\njoy. Being able to travel back to the\nancient dynasty he was most fascinated\nby. Although he lost the internet and\nelectronic entertainment, his life over\nthe past year had actually been more\ncarefree and comfortable than before.\nHowever, the sudden visit of Zhu Yuan\nJang and Ma showing made we Wu realize\nthat this piece was likely about to be\nbroken. After all, his courtyard\ncontained a large number of modern items\nthat clearly did not belong to this era,\nand he could not explain the origin of\nthese items using common sense. But a\nbold idea quickly took shape in Wei Wu's\nmind. He decided to take the initiative\nto confess his identity as someone from\nthe future to Zhu Yuan Jang and his wife\nin order to gain their trust. Using\nhistorical memories and a constant\nsupply of resources from the system,\nthey aim to influence the future of the\nMing dynasty while also planning a\nstable and prosperous life for\nthemselves. Wayi Wu was wondering\nwhether he should find a suitable way to\nexplain when a middle-aged man spoke\nfirst. Young man, my wife and I left in\na hurry and forgot to bring any money.\nNow we are hungry and it is inconvenient\nfor us to go back the way we came. We\nsmelled the fragrance coming from your\ncourtyard, so we dared to come and see\nif we could ask for a bite to eat. Upon\nhearing this, a strange light flashed in\nWei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s eyes, but he smiled and\npretended not to understand, replying,\n\"Old man, you're too kind. It's just a\nmeal. There's no need for money.\nBesides, this is right under the\nemperor's nose. Who would dare to act\nrecklessly? If you don't mind, please\ncome in. There's still some left in the\npot.\" Upon hearing this, a hint of\napproval flashed in the man's eyes. He\ncupuffed his hands and smiled. Then,\n\"Thank you very much for your righteous\nhelp, young brother. You're too kind.\nHelping others is helping yourself.\"\nWeii Wu smiled and stepped aside,\nleading the two into the courtyard. As\nsoon as he entered the courtyard, the\naroma of the red oil in the pot became\neven stronger. The middle-aged man\ncouldn't help but stare intently at the\nhot pot, his Adam's apple bobbing as he\nswallowed it several times. Looking at\nthe pot of red oil bubbling in the\nmiddle, he couldn't help but ask, \"Young\nman, is this the legendary antique soup\nyou're cooking in this pot?\" Weii Wu\nlaughed heartily. Old man, you've seen\nit all. Indeed, this thing has existed\nsince ancient times, but I prefer to\ncall it hot pot. Hot pot? That's a\nstraightforward name. The man smiled and\nnodded. Weii Wu turned and went to the\nkitchen. We brought back two sets of\nbowls and chopsticks before sitting\ndown. Grandpa's, this pot of soup is\nquite flavorful and spicy. I wonder if\nyou can handle it. The man waved his\nhand and laughed. We come from poor\nbackgrounds. As long as we have enough\nto eat, we can't be picky. As soon as he\nfinished speaking, he picked up his\nchopsticks, grabbed a slice of fatty\nbeef, and threw it into his mouth. At\nfirst, the aroma was enticing and the\nflavor intense, followed by a burning\nsensation that swept through his entire\nmouth. He gasped for breath to cool it\ndown while wiping the sweat from his\nforehead, his expression quite\ncomplicated. It took him a while to\nrecover, and he turned to look at Wei\nWu. Young man, what did you put in this\npot? Why is it so spicy? It's\npractically on fire. We woo suppressed a\nlaugh and replied meaningfully, \"Chili\npepper. Chili pepper? What is that? It's\na bit complicated. You can think of it\nas a more potent form of dogwood. Weii\nWu replied casually. The man nodded upon\nhearing this and didn't press further.\nInstead, changing the subject. By the\nway, young man, I didn't even ask your\nname while eating this meal with you. My\nsurname is Wei and my given name is Woo.\nYou could just call me Shia Woo. We Woo\nreplied. Upon hearing this, the man's\neyes lit up. Weii Woo. The Woo of Xia\nWei. That's an extraordinary name. Your\nfather must have high hopes for you.\nWayi Wu quickly waved his hand. Old man,\nplease don't talk nonsense right now.\nThe Ming dynasty is at peace. It's not\nauspicious to talk about warlords. He\ndeliberately changed the subject. Old\nman, you haven't told us your surname\nyet? The man smiled slightly. My surname\nis Zu. I'm the eighth in my family. Some\ncalled Juba. This is my wife, Maing.\nUpon hearing this name, Wayi Wu&lt;unk&gt;s\nexpression remained unchanged. But\ninwardly, he was already thinking,\n\"HZhuba Ming, you think I wouldn't\nrecognize you just because you change\nyour name?\" The thought that the mighty\nHong Wu emperor would come to his\ncourtyard to eat hot pot filled Wei Woo\nwith a sense of utter absurdity, but he\nstill maintained a calm demeanor.\nLooking up, Zhu Yuan Jang was already\nsweating profusely from the spiciness,\npanting as he ate, reluctant to put down\nhis chopsticks. Empress Ma carefully\nwiped the sweat from his forehead. Just\nas the three were enjoying their meal,\nZhu Yuan Jang suddenly put down his\nchopsticks, got up, looked around the\ncourtyard, walked to the wall, pointed\nto a bicycle, and asked, \"This iron\nframe only has two wheels front and\nback, and there's no horse or pusher,\nyet it can move.\" He then pointed to the\nmetal grill next to him. In this thing,\nit looks like a pot, but it's not a pot.\nRows of iron bars are laid out\nhorizontally. The structure is quite\ningenious. Finally, his gaze fell on the\nhaird dryer and power bank beside the\ndoorstep, especially the solar panel\nexposed the sunlight, which made him\nfall in a deep thought. After a long\nsilence, he finally spoke. These items\nare strange in style and are clearly not\nproduced in our great Ming dynasty. They\nare even difficult to describe. Having\nsaid that, Zhu Yuan Jang sat down again,\nhis eyes fixed on Wei Wu, his tone\ntinged with inquiry. Young man, when I\ngave my name just now, your expression\nwas clearly off. You should have\nrecognized me by now, right? What is\nyour background? And where did you\nobtain these artifacts? Facing Xuing\nJangs direct gaze, Wei Wu remained\nsilent for a long time before letting\nout a soft sigh and launching into his\nperformance. as expected of Lord Hungu.\nHow could my little tricks fool you? I\nnever expected that eating hot pot would\nattract your attention. Seeing his frank\nattitude, Xu Yuan Jang softened his\ntone. Don't worry, if I really thought\nyou were an assassin, you would probably\nalready be riddled with arrows by now.\nNo one knew about this trip out of the\npalace. It was just a spur-of-the-\nmoment decision. I never expected to\nencounter someone as extraordinary as\nyou here. Now, I want to hear you tell\nme yourself. Who exactly are you? Wayi\nWu knew that the only way to save his\nlife at this time was to make himself\nappear irreplaceable. If Zhu Yuan Jang\ncould realize his value, he might not\nhave treated him as a heretic, but\ninstead treated him like a treasure. The\nmost direct and effective way to do this\nwas to confront him directly. But Wayi\nWu also knew that this was a huge\ngamble. Even if he could speak\neloquently, he couldn't guarantee that\nZhu Yuan Jang would believe him. Not to\nmention that if his identity as a person\nfrom the future were exposed, he might\nnot even be able to save his life. So\nbefore speaking, Wayi Wu first opened\nthe system in his mind and checked if\nthere were any usable trump cards in his\nstorage space. Most of the items were\nodds and ends, but two of them were\nenough to save his life in a crisis. An\noff-road vehicle he had driven out of\nand the classic 11.43 mm M1911 pistol.\nHe would not use it lightly unless\nabsolutely necessary. But when he was\ntruly at his wits end, he would not sit\nidly by and wait for his doom. At this\nmoment, Zhu Yuan Jang stared intently at\nhim. Weii Wu took a deep breath,\nremained silent for a long time, and\nfinally spoke slowly. \"Your Majesty Hong\nWu, if I told you that I am not from\nthis era, would you believe me?\" Upon\nhearing this, Zhu Yuan Jang raised an\neyebrow and countless possibilities\nflashed through his mind. Foreign tribes\nfrom the western regions, strange\nfigures from the martial arts world, and\neven sorcerers and magicians. But he\nnever expected Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s answer to be\nmore outrageous than all his guesses.\nHowever, he saw no trace of lying in Wei\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s eyes. Zhu Yuan Jang pondered\nfor a moment, then pressed, \"What do you\nmean by saying you're not from this\nera?\" Wei Wu looked directly into Zhu Yu\nand Jang&lt;unk&gt;s eyes and said, \"Word by\nword, I am a person from 600 years in\nthe future who traveled from the future.\nJust like your majesty who suddenly\ntraveled from the Ming dynasty to the\nreign of Emperor Wu of the Tang Dynasty\n600 years ago, this is what I\nexperienced.\" It sounds absurd, but I\ncan't explain it either. It's true, and\nI myself don't know why I came here. Zhu\nYu and Jang&lt;unk&gt;s eyes flickered\nslightly and Empress Ma also looked\nsurprised. Before he finished speaking,\nWayi Wu suddenly stood up, walked to the\nwall, hopped on the bicycle, and rode it\naround the courtyard. \"This thing is\ncalled a bicycle. In our time, it was\none of the common people's means of\ntransportation,\" he explained as he\nrode, his pedals nimble and the wheels\nswift as the wind. Zhu Yuan Jang stared\nin amazement at the iron device that\ncould be propelled by foot, even feeling\na slight urge to try it himself. Then\nWayi Wu parked the carriage against the\nwall and walked to the haird dryer in\nfront of the doorstep. This is called a\nhair dryer. It's used to dry your hair\nafter showering. It has two modes, cold\nair and hot air. As he spoke, he plug in\nthe power bank, pressed the button, and\nthe hair dryer immediately began to hum.\nA jet of air shot out and Wayi Wu\ndeliberately demonstrated on his own\nhair, the strands swaying in the wind\nand making a soft rustling sound. Seeing\nthe iron block spewing wind out of thin\nair, Zhu Yuan Jang&lt;unk&gt;s eyes widened in\nshock. Empress Ma, though somewhat\ncomposed, also looked incredulous. After\nthe demonstration, Weii Wu returned to\nthe table and said calmly, \"Your\nmajesty, the beverage you drank, and the\nalcohol stove you used are also from our\nera.\" \"My claim that I am from the\nfuture is just empty talk. Only these\nthings can prove I wasn't lying. Whether\nyou believe me or not is entirely up to\nyou.\" At this moment, Zhu Yuan Jang was\ncompletely impressed by those artifacts.\nHe wasn't stupid. Even if he didn't\nunderstand the principles, he knew these\nobjects were extraordinary, especially\nthe haird dryer, which could generate\nheat by blowing air using something\ncalled electricity. If it could be\napplied to the battlefield or for\ncivilian use, its potential would be\nimmeasurable. He hesitated, but\nultimately didn't reach out a try. Shiao\nWu, you said this blower doesn't have a\nbellows, yet can produce a strong wind\nand even hot air. Hearing Zu Yuan Jan\ncall him Xiao Wu directly, Weii Wu knew\nhe had made the right bet. He had\nalready guessed that this question would\nbe difficult to explain, so he tried to\nrespond in a way that the other party\ncould understand. A hair dryer relies on\nelectricity. There's a small fan blade\ninside that can blow air like a person\nblowing air. As for the hot air, you can\nthink of it as a small ball of charcoal\ninside that can be activated by\nelectricity to blow out hot air. Zu Yuan\nJang gave a thoughtful. Though he didn't\nunderstand the details, he grasped the\ngeneral idea. He then pointed to the\nportable power bank. The electricity\nyou're talking about. Is it the power of\nlightning from heaven? Can this thing\ncontrol lightning? Wayi Wu shook his\nhead and explained, \"It's something like\nthat, except it doesn't create\nlightning, but rather stores the power\nof lightning. We call a battery. This is\na portable power bank that can be\ncarried around and stores a small amount\nof electrical energy. Explaining these\ntechnological products was also a bit of\na headache for wei Wu. Trying to explain\nmodern science to the ancients was no\neasy task. Fortunately, Zhu Yuan Jang\nwas quick-witted. Although he couldn't\nfully grasp the structural principles of\nelectricity, he had already recognized\nthe hidden value behind these things.\nHowever, Zhu Yuan Jangs true concerns\nwent beyond these matters. As the\nfounding emperor, his primary focus was\nalways the fate of the nation and the\ndynasty's destiny. So, he suppressed his\ncuriosity, looked at Wayi Wu, and his\ntone became more serious. Since you come\nfrom the future, you should know what\nwill become of the Ming dynasty. Empress\nMar raised her head upon hearing this.\nHer expression a mixture of nervousness\nand anticipation. Weii Wu sighed\ninwardly. They've come after all. Zhu\nYuan Jang was after all an emperor.\nThough he loved his descendants, his\ngreatest concern was ultimately the\nempire. However, to be honest, the\neccentric emperors of the late Ming\ndynasty would probably have made Ju Yuan\nJang, the Hongu Emperor, so angry he\nwould have died on the spot. Especially\nafter Emperor Inzong, the emperors\nbecame more and more outrageous. Some\nplayed with crickets, some refined\nalchemy, some did carpentry, and some\nneglected state affairs. Faced with Zhu\nYuan Jang&lt;unk&gt;s direct question, we will\nremain silent for a moment before slowly\nspeaking. Your majesty, regarding the\nfate of the nation, I can only say that\nthe future can be changed. What I know\nis only history before I appeared in\nthis era. Now that I have arrived here,\neverything may change. Chapter 4. The\nMing Dynasty. The most resolute dynasty\nin history. Wii Wu originally addressed\nZhu Yuan Jang as Hong Wu Lord. But the\nmoment he suddenly changed his address\nto Your Majesty, Zhu Yuan Jang\nimmediately understood that what he was\nabout to say was probably not something\nhe wanted to hear. But since it\nconcerned the fate of the nation, even\nwith a premonition, he had to listen. So\nZhu Yuan Jang nodded solemnly. Just say\nit. I won't hold you accountable for\nthings that haven't happened yet. Wayi\nWu knew that Zhu&lt;unk&gt;s words might not\nbe reliable. After all, those who\nreceive the imperial edict in history\noften couldn't save their lives. But\nthis promise was better than nothing. He\nthought for a moment, then answered\ndecisively. Your majesty, historical\nrecords show that the Ming dynasty\nlasted for 276 years. Upon hearing this\nnumber, Zhu Yuan Jang&lt;unk&gt;s expression\nchanged. Not even 300 years. Not even as\nlong as those spineless cowards of the\nSong Dynasty. Weii Wu quickly comforted\nhim. We can't just look at the duration.\nTheQin dynasty unified the six kingdoms,\nbut its reign lasted only 14 years. But\nin the eyes of later generations, the\nMing dynasty was the most spirited\ndynasty, far surpassing the Song\nDynasty. The Song Dynasty lasted 300\nyears, but couldn't even recover the 16\nprefectures of Yan and Yun, while the\nMing dynasty recovered its lost\nterritory in just one year. As he\nfinished speaking, his voice rang with\npride. Later generations say that the\nMing dynasty did not engage in marriage\nalliances, pay indemnities, seed\nterritory, or paid tribute. The emperor\nguarded the nation's gates, and the\nmonarch died for the state. Historical\nrecords specifically that Dongu Jin also\nstate that our dynasty did not intermar\nwith barbarians, pay annual tributes, or\naddress them as brothers. The Ming\ndynasty was the most unyielding. Zhu\nYuan Jang, unable to suppress his smile\nafter hearing this flattery, exclaimed,\n\"Well said, my great Ming dynasty will\nnot follow the example of the Tang\nDynasty, where brothers turned against\neach other, nor will it be as weak and\neasily bullied as the Song Dynasty.\nChildren should not be used as\nbargaining chips for peace. Anyone who\ndares to invade our territory will have\ntheir hands broken.\" But Wayi Wu&lt;unk&gt;s\nexpression was somewhat unnatural. It\nwas true that there wasn't fratricside\nwithin the Zhu family, but there were\nplenty of uncles and nephews turning\nagainst each other and many vying for\nthe throne. The Yonga Emperor, after\nall, seized the throne through the Jing\ncampaign. At this moment, Zhu Yuan Jang\nsuddenly frowned. No marriage alliances,\nno indemnities, no tributes. All sound\ngood. But you say the emperor guards the\nnation's gates, the monarch dies for the\nstate. Doesn't that mean my great Ming\ndynasty is doomed? Then who guards a\nnation's gates? Who dies for the state?\nWhat Zhu Yuan Jang cared about most was\nwhether these two were his crown prince\nZhu Bao or his grandson Zu Xionging.\nUpon hearing this, Wayi Wu broke out in\na sweat. He was struggling with how to\nrespond when his hand instinctively\nreached into his system to retrieve a\ncigarette and lighter. Just as he was\nabout to light it, he noticed Empress Ma\nbeside him and quietly put it down.\nHowever, this act of obtaining things\nout of thin air completely attracted the\nattention of Zhu Yuan Jang and Empress\nMa. Wayi Wu then realized that he\nprobably couldn't hide it any longer.\nSo, he simply revealed his identity.\nYour Majesty, actually, I can't explain\nthese things either. I only know that I\ncan obtain them every once in a while.\nAfter speaking, he lowered his head, his\nexpression solemn. Sometimes I wonder\nwhy am I here and why me? Who is behind\nall this? And what is their purpose?\nSeeing his low spirits, Zhu Yuan Jang\ncomforted him, saying, \"Don't overthink\nit if you can't figure it out. Since\nyou're here, make the best of it. Maybe\nyou're here to change the fate of my\nMing dynasty.\" Upon hearing this, we wu\nimmediately understood Zhu Yu and\nJang&lt;unk&gt;s intention. This emperor\nwasn't afraid of him being an\nextraordinary being. On the contrary, he\nplanned to use his future memories to\nscheme for the future of the Ming\ndynasty. Weiiwood didn't object. Imagine\nthe future Ming dynasty's ironclad fleet\nsweeping across the oceans, bringing\nback beauties and unifying the world.\nJust thinking about it made his blood\nboil. But he was truly unwilling to\nparticipate in national politics.\nEspecially serving under Zhu Yuan Jang\nwas a hellish and life-threatening job.\nSo he simply laid his cards on the\ntable. I am willing to serve the Ming\ndynasty, but I do not want to enter the\ncourt. I do not understand policy\ndiscussions and I do not want to get\ninvolved in official struggles. Zu Yuan\nJang readily agreed. All right, we won't\nforce you into the court. Now you should\ntell me who is the saying the emperor\nguards the nation's gate the monarch\ndies for the state referring to wei wu\nsmiled bitterly knowing that he couldn't\nescape this hurdle so he took a deep\nbreath and prepared to slowly recount\nthe most somber historical truth chapter\n5 recounts the glorious deeds of Ming\nBzong to old Jewi Wu paused for a moment\nbefore slowly uttering those words the\nemperor guards the nation's gate the\nmonarch eyes for the state refers to two\ncrucial historical moments in the Ming\ndynasty. One was a Yongla emperor moving\nthe capital to Being and personally\noverseeing the situation. The other was\nthe Chongian Emperor hanging himself on\nCole Hill, ending the Ming dynasty. Upon\nhearing the words hanging himself on\nCole Hill, Zhu Yuan Jangs face\nimmediately darkened and his eyes blazed\nwith fury. For a ruler of a nation to\nend up like this was a disgrace to\nanyone. Seeing his emotions, Weii Wu\nquickly added, \"After the battle of\nTamu, the country's strength declined\nsharply. Coupled with a sudden change in\nclimate, there was a severe crop failure\nand the people were starving. Civil\nofficials colluded with aristocratic\nfamilies and Unix controlled the\ngovernment under layers of exploitation.\nThe people lived in dire straits. In the\nChongjan era, he did want to be a good\nemperor, and he did try, but he was\nwilling, but unable to do so. Weii Wu\nspoke in a heavy tone, as if recounting\nan unchangeable tragedy. At that time,\nthe National Treasury was empty, and\neven military pay could not be paid. On\nthe day the capital fell, the bandits\nsearched the entire city, only to find\nthat there wasn't even 10,000 tales of\nsilver in the palace. It's ironic that\n70 million tales were found in the homes\nof those high-ranking officials and\nwealthy families. Tanchin recorded in\nthe Gua that Emperor Chong was frugal\nand even sent his personal bronze were\nto be used for casting weapons. Yet the\nimperial treasury was pitifully empty.\nIf anyone had been in that position,\nthey probably would have had to atone\nfor their sins with their death. At this\npoint, Wayi Wu stopped, not continuing.\nHe knew that Zhu Yuan Jang wasn't in the\nmood for a story. Sure enough, Zhuan\nJang&lt;unk&gt;s face turned ashen, his chest\nheaving violently, his fists clenched so\ntightly that veins bulged. As the\nemperor who hated corrupt officials the\nmost, his mind was in turmoil. Empress\nMa standing beside him looked worried\nand gently patted his back to help him\ncatch his breath. Weii Wu sat there\npatiently, waiting until Zhu Yuan Jang\ncalmed down before he softly asked,\n\"Uncle Zu, how about we stop here for\ntoday and you take a rest.\" Zhu Yuan\nJang waved his hand, a fierce glint in\nhis eyes. We crawled out of mountains of\ncorpses and seas of blood. We're not\ngoing to be scared by these things. He\npatted Empress Ma beside him and turned\nto look at Wayi Wu. Continue. Tell me\nmore about the Tumu crisis and the\nlittle ice age that you just mentioned.\nAt that moment, Wayi Wu felt a surge of\nadmiration. Oldju truly lived up to his\nreputation as a great ruler. Even when\nhis emotions were difficult to control,\nhe could immediately grasp the core\nissue. In the 14th year of the Jung\nreign, during the reign of Emperor\nInzong of Ming, Zhu Xiin, the leader,\nEen led his army south. As a result, the\nyoung and impetuous emperor under the\ninstigation of a unic Wong Jean\npersonally led the expedition which was\nhasty and chaotic. Wong Jean in order to\nshow off when he returned to his\nhometown led hundreds of thousands of\ntroops and changed the route haphazardly\nwithout even ensuring logistics. In the\nend, they were surrounded by the enemy\nat Tumu Fortress and hundreds of\nthousands of troops were wiped out and\neven the emperor became a prisoner. At\nthis point, Weii Wu&lt;unk&gt;s throat was a\nlittle dry. He casually took out a\nbottle of cola from his system and was\nabout to take a sip when Zu Yuan Jang\nsnatched it away with lightning speed.\nYou brat, you don't even know how to\nshow some respect to your uncle Zhu.\nI'll take this bottle. Weii Wu looked\nhelpless, so he took out two more\nbottles from the system and\nconsiderately opened one and handed it\nto Empress Ma. Empress Ma took it and\nsmiled while Zhu Yuan Jang took a sip\nlike a child who had received candy and\nhis brows relaxed as the three drank and\nchatted. Zhu Yuan Jang&lt;unk&gt;s attention\nreturned to what way Wu had just\nmentioned. The defeat at Tumu Fortress\nwith hundreds of thousands of soldiers\nkilled and the emperor captured was a\nlesson that Zhu Yuan Jang could not fail\nto heed, especially since the Unic Wong\nJean had seized military power. This\npained him more than if his heart had\nbeen ripped out. This Wong Xan, isn't he\na unic? Zhu Yuan Jang raised his head\nand asked coldly. That's right. He's a\nunic. We nodded affirmatively. Old\nJu&lt;unk&gt;s expression instantly froze, his\ntiger-like eyes seeming to spit fire.\nFortunately, he was no longer as furious\nas before, and after slowly calming\ndown, another question arose. Shia Wu,\nyou just said that Emperor was named Zhu\nChiian. Wayi Wu nodded. Yes. Hearing\nthis name, Zhu Yuan Jang frowned even\nmore. Back then, we personally\ndetermined the generational names. The\nBowo lineage is Yun Wan Zun, Zushuan,\nChin Wu, Daju, and Shong. Where did she\ncome from? On the contrary, it was the\nfourth prince's lineage that only\nreached the character Chi in the\nimperial family. Could it be that the\nfourth prince's lineage ascended the\nthrone in later generations? Old Ju\ndidn't continue, but Weii Wu understood\nthe meaning of his words perfectly. It\nseemed that the thing he feared most had\nfinally come to pass. Weii Wu sighed,\nhesitated for a moment, and then said,\n\"This matter must begin with the Jang\nWen Emperor.\" \"Wait.\" Zhu Yuan Jang\nsuddenly waved his hand, interrupting\nhim. \"Tell me first, who is the Jang\nEmperor?\" Wei Wu had originally intended\nto avoid the topic of Zhu Bao and Zhu\nXiong Yying&lt;unk&gt;s deaths, but Zu Yuan\nJang&lt;unk&gt;s question made it impossible\nto avoid. He then thought that perhaps\nthis was also an opportunity. If he\ncould protect Zhu Bao and Zhu Xianging,\nit would be an immense favor to Zhu Yuan\nJang. He immediately answered frankly,\n\"The genuine Emperor is your grandson,\nZhu Yunwin.\" Upon hearing this name, Zhu\nYuan Jang&lt;unk&gt;s expression changed\ndrastically. \"Yunwin? Isn't he a son of\nconcubine? Neither the eldest son nor\nthe legitimate heir. How did he ascend\nthe throne? Chapter 6. Our son is dead.\nOur grandson is about to die. Wayi\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s words were like a heavy blow to\nZhu Yuan Jang&lt;unk&gt;s heart. You've\nprobably already guessed it.\nYunwin&lt;unk&gt;s ascension to the throne\nmeans something has happened to our\neldest son. Zhu Yuan Jang&lt;unk&gt;s\nexpression changed drastically. Xionging\nsomething happened to him, but the next\nmoment he shook his head and denied it.\nNo, even if Xiang Ying is really gone,\nYunwan should be made the successor. How\ncould it be Yunwin&lt;unk&gt;s turn? Weii Wu\nsighed softly, then said, \"Were by word,\nit was you who installed Zu Yun Wan,\nyour majesty.\" Zhu Yuan Jang was shocked\nand stood up abruptly, staring at Wei Wu\nin disbelief. Weii Wu did not pause, but\nrecited the contents word by word as if\nreciting a history book. In the 25th\nyear of Hong Wu, Crown Prince Zhu Bao\ndied of illness. In August of the same\nyear, he was buried on the east side of\nShaoling Moselum and given theostumous\ntitle of Yuan. Empress Ma turned pale\nupon hearing this. While Zhu Yuan Jang\nfelt as if a bucket of cold water had\nbeen poured over his head. On one hand,\nhis son died young. On the other, his\ngrandson also met an untimely end. This\nwas a devastating blow to old Jew. His\neyes were red as he looked at wei Wu,\nhis voice as if it had cracked. How\nexactly did Bower leave? Weii Wu\nhesitated for a moment, but still\nanswered truthfully. The official record\nsays he died of illness, but folk rumors\nsay it was a cold or a carbunkcle on his\nback, but the most mainstream\nexplanation is that he died from\noverwork. He died from overwork. Zhu\nYuan Jang&lt;unk&gt;s voice trembled and he\nslapped Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s arm away. He was\nabout to refute, but then his heart\nskipped a beat. He recalled how over the\nyears he had worked day and night with\nZhu Bao to review memorials in order to\nforge the crown prince. Even he himself\nsometimes felt utterly exhausted. How\ncould Zu Bao, whose body was already\nfrail, withstand such a burden? We woo\ncould tell that he was about to\ncollapse. So, he immediately changed the\nsubject. Uncle Zu, I actually have an\nantidote for this kind of illness.\nWhether it's a cold or a carbuncle, I\ncan cure it. As long as you don't let\nhim get too tired, I'm confident that\nthe crown prince will be safe and\nsound.\" A glint flashed in Juyu and\nJang&lt;unk&gt;s eyes, and Empress Ma's eyes\ninstantly welled up with tears as if she\nhad seen a glimmer of hope. Weii Wu\ncontinued, \"But I can't help with the\nillness. This matter can only be\nresolved by you changing the system\nyourself. Everything else is negotiable.\nPreserving my life is the most important\nthing. Zhu Yuan Jang nodded\nemphatically, his tone softening. After\nYun Wan ascended the throne, where did\nXiang Ing and Yin Tong go? Weii Wu was\nsilent for a moment before finally\nrevealing the truth. Xiang Ing died of\nillness on the first day of the fifth\nmonth of the first year of Janguin's\nreign. The cause of his illness was\nunknown. He was buried in Jong Xan and\ngiven theostumous title of Hawaii. Zhu\nYuan Jang felt dizzy and his vision\nblurred. He almost fell. The eldest\ngrandson only has one month to live. He\noverturned the hot pot on the table,\nscattering metal utensils everywhere.\nImmediately afterward, the courtyard\ngate was violently kicked open, and a\ngroup of plain closed guards wielding\nknives rushed in, all pointing at Wayi\nWu. But he remained unfazed, only\nglancing calmly at Ju Yuan Jang. Old Ju\nroared, \"Get out of here. Anyone who\ndares to step into this courtyard will\nbe sent to death row. Silence returned\nto the courtyard. Zhu Yuan Jang sat back\ndown, his eyes still bloodshot. Shia Wu,\nwhat did later generations say? Just say\nit. Don't hold back. We Wu nodded gently\nand began to explain. Some say the crown\nprince died of smallpox. Some say it was\na cold. And there are even more vicious\nrumors. They say that Lady Lu wanted her\nson to become emperor. So, she poisoned\nXiang Ing and ruined Yun Wan so that he\ncould ascend the throne naturally. Upon\nhearing this, Zhu Yuan Jang frowned and\npondered for a moment. Lady Lu doesn't\nhave a guts. She can't do anything under\nour noses. That's what he said. But Wayi\nWu knew that Zhu Yuan Jang had already\nbecome suspicious. Even the most absurd\nrumors never come from nowhere. Zhu Yuan\nJang pressed on in a deep voice. What\nabout small pox? Didn't you say that\nXioming had small pox? Do you have any\nmedical skills? Weiiw thought for a\nmoment and answered frankly, I don't\nhave a way to cure smallpox, but I know\nhow to prevent it. Zu Yu and Jang&lt;unk&gt;s\neyes suddenly lit up. Prevention? Tell\nme quickly. Wayiwi Wu organized his\nthoughts and slowly explained. We\ndiscovered that cattle can also get a\ndisease called cowpox, which is similar\nto smallpox, but the symptoms are much\nmilder. As long as the cowpox virus is\ninoculated into humans, they can become\nimmune to smallpox after recovery. Zhu\nYuan Jang was stunned and repeatedly\nasked, \"You mean diseases on cattle can\nprevent people from getting smallox?\"\n\"Yes, but the process is a bit\ncomplicated, but that's the principle.\"\nZhu Yuan Jang suddenly slammed his hand\non the table and shouted, \"Maang!\" No\nsooner had he finished speaking than a\nfigure swiftly flashed into the\ncourtyard, kneeling and awaiting orders.\nFrom today onwards, investigate the\nsmallox outbreak with all your might.\nSelect people from the Imperial prison\nto be infected with smallox for\nexperiments. We need to know if it can\nsave lives and if it can protect against\nsmallox. Chapter 7. The strongest\nlife-saving talisman in history is\nobtained. After Maang left the\ncourtyard, Zhu Yuan Jang looked at Wayi\nWu. He asked him seriously, \"How many\nyears will I live?\" Weii Wu smiled and\nsaid without any hesitation, \"Uncle Zu,\nyou will live to be 70.\" Looking at\nhistory, that is a very long life for an\nemperor. Hearing this answer, Zhu Yuan\nJang was somewhat satisfied. At least he\ncould live for another 10 years or so,\ncontinuing to protect the empire. But\nthen he turned to look at Empress Ma,\nhis eyes filled with worry. And what\nabout our sister? This question left\nWayi Woo speechless. He felt incredibly\nbitter. The fate of the Ming dynasty's\nroyal family was just too tragic. He\nalmost couldn't resist taking out his\nphone and playing a song about the Ming\ndynasty's impending doom just to remind\nold Zu of what was going on. But jokes\naside, Empress Ma, his talisman, still\nneeded to live. He dared not act\nrecklessly. Looking at the calm yet\nconcerned expression on Empress Ma's\nface, he finally lowered his head and\nsighed. In August of the 15th year of\nHung Wu&lt;unk&gt;s reign, Empress Ma passed\naway at the age of 51. She was\npostumously honored as Empress Xiaozi\nand buried in the Ming Shaoling moselum.\nThere are rumors that she contracted the\ndisease while taking care of the crown\nprince Xianging who was infected with\nsmallpox and eventually died in her\nsleep. Although the historical records\ndo not specify the cause of her illness,\nlater generations have always regarded\nAunt Ma as a virtuous empress throughout\nthe ages. Hearing this, Zhu Yuan Jan was\nfilled with mixed emotions. There was no\nsmile in his eyes, only a deep gloom.\nWhat used were others praises of her\nvirtue. She was gone. It was all\nmeaningless. His anger wasn't just\ndirected at fate. It also burned towards\nthe historians. Those freeloaders, they\ncan't even remember the historical\nrecords properly. Do they really think\nour swords are dull? Seeing his burning\nanger, Wu hurriedly explained, \"Uncle\nZu, it's not entirely their fault. After\nyour death, many historical records were\ndestroyed by the Jinghou Gins. The\nJingjo Gurchins, who later became the\nMancho, attempted to distort history by\nrewriting the history of Ming and\ninstigating literary inquisitions after\nconquering the central plains. And they\nwere originally vassels of the Ming\ndynasty, known as the Jinu. Upon hearing\nthis, Zhu Yuan Jangs eyes flashed with a\ncold light. He secretly memorized the\nwords Jang knew, fearing future\nassassination attempts. However, his\ngreater concern was whether Empress Ma's\ncause of death was truly as rumored. If\nit was indeed smallox, time was of the\nessence. The effectiveness of cowpox\nvaccination needed to be verified as\nsoon as possible. But if it wasn't\nsmallox, where should the investigation\nbegin? Thinking of all this, he felt a\nsurge of frustration, as if he had been\nslapped in the face countless times in a\nsingle day. Suddenly, he solemnly\npromised Weii Woo, \"We woo, no matter\nwhat method you use, as long as you can\nsave my sister's life, from this day\nforward, you can roam freely throughout\nthe Ming dynasty.\" Upon hearing this\npromise, Weii Wu felt no joy, but rather\ngrew even calmer. He knew that the words\nof an emperor, though seemingly\ninfallible, were the least trustworthy.\nRight now, Zhu Yuan Jang needed his\nhelp. So naturally, he would agree to\nanything. But if there were any acts of\ndisobedience in the future, he would\nstill be executed without hesitation.\nFortunately, these words were spoken in\nfront of Empress Ma. As long as she was\nalive, this promise of walking sideways\ncould at least save his life. However,\ngiven the uncertainty surrounding\nEmpress Ma's cause of death, Wayi Wu\ndared not easily sign a pledge of life\nor death. He remained silent for a long\ntime before finally speaking. Uncle Zu,\nI cannot guarantee that I can save Aunt\nMa's life. But I can guarantee that as\nlong as there is even the slightest\nchance, I will do my utmost and fight\nwith all my might.\" These words were\nspoken with firmness and strength.\nAlthough Zhu Yuan Jang was somewhat\ndissatisfied, the look in his eyes\nshowed approval. From the moment he\nentered, he had been observing Weii Wu,\nincluding the subtle detail of him\noffering the drink to Empress Ma.\nFurthermore, his restraint when he took\nout the small box to light a cigarette\nupon seeing Empress Ma's presence all\nindicated that this young man from later\ngenerations truly respected his sister.\nJust as Yu Yuan Jang was about to\nrespond, Empress Ma stood up and walked\nto Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s side. She gently patted\nWei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s shoulder and said in a\ngentle tone, \"I have agreed to this on\nbehalf of Chumba. You call me aunt, so\nnaturally I will treat you as my own\njunior. I'm sorry to have troubled you\nwith my affairs, Shiao Wu. Just do your\nbest and don't feel too burdened. Zu\nYuan Jang stood by without refuting,\nknowing full well that his sister's\nresolve was unwavering. Weii Wu felt a\nsense of relief. With Empress Ma around,\nhis life wasn't so precarious. But then\nEmpress Ma added, \"Shia Wu, you are a\nremarkable person of later generations.\nSince you can't go back, why not settle\ndown and make a living in this Ming\ndynasty? She paused, then looked at Zu\nYuan Jang. As long as you don't betray\nthe Ming dynasty, and don't betray his\nmajesty, no one in the Ming dynasty can\nharm you in the slightest. These words\nwere practically a lifesaving talisman\nfor the Ming dynasty, more effective\nthan any get out of jail free card. It\nmust be understood that in the Ming\ndynasty, Empress Ma's word was law,\ncarrying more weight than Zhu Yu and\nJongs. Now, this protective talisman had\nfinally fallen upon Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s head.\nHowever, Weii Wu understood that Empress\nMa's support for him wasn't solely based\non affection. Her true value lay in his\nability to make the Ming dynasty\nstronger and its reign longer. This\nrelationship of mutual benefit suited\nWeii Woos intentions perfectly. While\nothers would express gratitude at this\ntime, he knew how to seize the\nopportunity and press his advantage. I\nwon't say anything more, Aunt Ma. I must\npresent you with a small gift to express\nmy gratitude. After saying this, he\nflipped his wrist and pulled out an\nexquisite box from his system space,\nhanding it to Empress Ma. Chapter 8\nfinally saw these two powerful figures\noff. Although it wasn't the first time\nthey'd seen each other, Zhu Yuan Jang\nand Empress Ma were still amazed when\nWei Wu once again conjured something out\nof thin air. However, their surprise\nonly lasted a moment before their\nattention was drawn to the gift box in\nhis hand. It was a simple, square,\nclean, and elegant velvet gift box.\nWayiwood didn't agonize over what to\ngive, simply choosing a safe bet, a\nperfume gift set. Empress Ma was always\nthrifty, but even the most frugal woman\ncan't resist the allure of fragrance.\nSince the hot pot had already been\noverturned, Wayi Wu simply placed the\ngift box on the table and opened the\nlid. Inside lay four crystal clearar\nperfume bottles, each exquisitely\ncrafted, emitting a faint fragrance.\nPointing to the bottles, he explained to\nEmpress Ma, \"This is called perfume. It\nlasts longer than the current scented\nlotions, lasting up to 3 hours. When\nsprayed on clothing, it lasts even\nlonger. The scent will also gradually\nchange over time. Having said that, he\npicked up one of the bottles,\ndemonstrated the spraying motion, and\nthen respectfully handed it over.\nEmpress Ma took the perfume, lightly\nsprayed it on her lapel, and immediately\nthe fragrance filled the air. Her eyes\nlit up slightly, and a look of amazement\nappeared on her face. This fragrance was\nindeed extraordinary. While perfumed\nlotion was fragrant, it was ultimately\nthin, unlike this perfume which was rich\nand layered. Even Ju Yuan Jang, a rough\nman, kept sniffing the fragrance,\ncompletely captivated by it. Seeing\nthis, Wei Wu took out a mini trial gift\nbox from the system and handed it to Zhu\nYuan Jang. Uncle Zu, these are small\nbottles of perfume. They'll be suitable\nfor you to give to your concubines in\nthe herum later. Zhu Yuan Jang glanced\nat the box and saw that the bottles were\nonly the size of his little finger,\nwhich he found quite appropriate.\nCompared to Empress Ma's four bottles,\nthis box looked like a sample set, and\nhe nodded in satisfaction. You're\nthoughtful, young man. No wonder my\nsister is so protective of you. After\nsaying that, he put the perfume box\naway. The important matter was about to\nbegin. We were halfway through our\nquestioning earlier. What exactly\nhappened during the little ice age? Zhu\nYuan Jang still remembered that crucial\npoint as well as the unavoidable issue\nof generational names. But before he\ncould finish speaking, Empress Ma\nsuddenly interrupted him, saying, \"Chung\nBa, it's getting late. We should return\nto the palace.\" Zhu Yuan Jang wanted to\nhold on a little longer, but when he\nlooked up, it was already dark and there\nwere still many palace affairs to attend\nto. After thinking for a moment, he\nfigured Weii Wu wouldn't run away and\nthere would be time later, so he nodded\nand got up. \"Shia Wu, do you live alone\nin this courtyard? Do you have any\nrelatives?\" Weii Wu shook his head,\nsmiling somewhat self-deprecatingly. If\nI hadn't transmigrated to the Ming\ndynasty, and if my name wasn't on the\nhousehold registration and land deeds, I\nprobably would have been treated as a\nvagrant.\" Upon hearing this, Zhu Yuan\nJang&lt;unk&gt;s expression turned solemn. He\nthen spoke in a stern voice. Since\nheaven has sent you here, we have a duty\nto protect you. We will make proper\narrangements for your affairs in the\nfuture. After speaking, he called out to\nthe door, \"Maang Maang immediately\nentered the courtyard and knelt down to\nawait orders.\" Without hesitation, Zhu\nYuan Jang ordered, \"Leave a team of men\nto guard this courtyard, but they must\nnot interfere with Wayi Wu&lt;unk&gt;s life.\nTheir sole duty is to protect his\nsafety. Remember, do whatever he tells\nyou to do. If even a single hair on his\nhead falls, you will all be buried with\nhim. Maang lowered his head, not daring\nto answer too loudly, but firmly\nreplied, \"Your subject will certainly\nnot fail in your duty,\" and swears to\nprotect young Master Wei. Weii Wu,\nwatching from the side, couldn't help\nbut chuckle, secretly wondering if he\nshould deliberately pluck a hair to test\nMaang's reaction. However, considering\nthat this man was doing a job that\nrisked his life, he couldn't bear to\ntease him. Just as he was lost in\nthought, Zhu Yuan Jang suddenly looked\nat him again. Shia Wu, let's go back to\nthe palace with my sister. Empress Ma\nalso smiled gently and softly\ninstructed, \"If you want to see your\naunt, just tell the guards and someone\nwill take you into the palace.\" Weii Wu\nnodded quickly. \"Yes, Ma.\" The way he\naddressed her as Aunt Ma was so natural,\nbut Maang felt a jolt in his heart. This\nwasn't a title an ordinary person could\nuse so casually. Clearly, Empress Ma\nconsidered wei Woo family, and as the\nleader of the embroidered uniform guard,\nhe naturally understood its meaning. It\nwas an invisible get out of jail free\ncard. Maong silently made a mental note\nthat from now on, he would not only\nprotect Weii Wu, but also actively\ncultivate a good relationship with him.\nAfter making some arrangements, Maang\npersonally escorted Juu Yuan Jang and\nEmpress Mi. Only after the two great\nfigures had left did we woo breathe a\nsigh of relief. Finally, I've seen those\ntwo big shots off. He glanced back at\nthe mess on the table, then carry the\npower bank that had been drying in the\nsun all day into the house. Over the\npast year, he'd received all sorts of\npackages. Some utterly ridiculous, like\nlubricant, completely useless. But\nothers were incredibly useful, like\nsofas and refrigerators. Meanwhile, in\nthe carriage on the way back from the\npalace, Zhu Yuan Jang and Empress Ma\nwere still discussing Weii Wu. Sister,\ndo you believe what that boy said?\nEmpress Ma asked calmly. He's from a\nlater era. We witnessed those\nextraordinary skills with our own eyes.\nHow can we not believe him? Zhu Yuan\nJang pondered for a moment, then said,\n\"Tell me, should we marry Yushuan to him\nand make him truly one of our family?\"\nChapter nine. What does this mean? A\nblind box with a box within a box? In\nancient feudal society, the royal family\nonly had a few methods to win people's\nhearts. Zhu Yuan Jang&lt;unk&gt;s decision to\nwin over Wei Wu was perfectly reasonable\nin Empress Ma's eyes. A genius like Wei\nWu, no matter what method was used, had\nto be bound to the Ming dynasty. No\nsooner had Zhu Yuan Jang finished\nspeaking than Empress Ma immediately\nchimed in. She remarked that Wayi Wu was\na good young man, but she wasn't sure if\nfuture generations would still value\nparental consent. She intended to probe\nWei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s thoughts first, lest she\nruined the good deed. Zhu Yuan Jan\nagreed with her reasoning. After all,\nonly Wayi Wu knew what customs would be\nlike 600 years later. He then looked at\nEmpress Ma. Sister, you're in such a\nhurry for me to return to the palace\nbecause of what we woo just said, right?\nEmpress Ma nodded and said decisively.\nAfter returning to the palace, \"Have\nsend X shionging to the inner palace,\nand I will take care of her personally.\nShe had no evidence, but she took Way\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s words to heart. Xiongying in\nparticular was both her precious darling\nand the future hope of the Ming dynasty.\nShe didn't believe Lady Lu would dare\nlay a hand on the crown prince, but she\nalso didn't believe she would properly\nraise him. Zhu Yuan Jang understood\nEmpress Ma's concerns. Years of\nexperience had taught him to see through\npeople's hearts. So, he immediately\nreplied, \"Shyonging is, after all, a\ngrandson of the emperor. It's not\nappropriate for him to stay in the inner\npalace for long. Let him stay with those\ntwo little ones at your place for now.\nOnce I made arrangements at the Eastern\nPalace, it won't be too late for him to\ngo back. At this moment, Wayi Wu had no\nidea that someone was already taking\ncare of his marriage. He suddenly\nremembered he hadn't opened his delivery\nfor the day. With a thought, he brought\nup the system inventory interface. The\ninventory was filled with various items\nhe had opened in the past. Three\ndelivery packages of different sizes\nwere floating in the air. The smallest\nwas like a book and the largest was like\na television. This is his delivery\nsystem. Three blind boxes a day. You can\nonly choose one. After a year of use,\nWayiu had long since figured out the\nsystems tricks. Package size is no\nindicator of the contents value. The car\nin the corner was taken from a package\nthe size of a cigarette pack. Looking at\nthe three packages in midair, he took a\ndeep breath and began chanting an\nincantation. Whoever I point to is\nwhoever it is. He ultimately chose the\nsmallest one. The scene flashed and the\nthree packages vanished simultaneously,\nreplaced by a shipping container. Yes,\nthe kind of large metal shipping\ncontainer commonly seen in harbors. Weii\nWu was speechless. Is this some kind of\nbox within a box? Containers can't be\nopened in a warehouse. They have to be\ndismantled in reality, but his room is\ntoo small to fit it all. He opened the\ndoor and went into the yard. Just as he\nwas about to start, he remembered he\nwasn't living alone. He knew there were\ndefinitely many people guarding or\nprotecting the house. A commotion like\nthis would likely alert a group of\npeople rushing in immediately. To be\nhonest, Wayiu didn't dislike these\npeople. Whether they were monitoring or\nprotecting him, at least they would be\nthe first to step in if anything really\nhappened. In this unfamiliar era, having\nsomeone help him withstand the risks was\nbetter than bearing them alone. He\nwalked to the courtyard gate and opened\nit. On either side of the gate stood two\nburly men. One was very strong and the\nother had a full beard. Upon seeing wei\nwoo open the door. The two immediately\nbowed. The taller guard spoke up. Young\nmaster way. It's curfew now. There are\nmilitary officers patrolling outside. If\nyou go out, we&lt;unk&gt;ll have to accompany\nyou. Wayi Wu wave his hand. I'm not\nstupid. What I do going out so late at\nnight. By the way, is it just the two of\nyou? The guard replied, \"There are\nothers deployed around to ensure your\nsafety.\" Wayi Wu nodded and continued,\n\"I have some things to do later, and the\nnoise might be a bit loud. I'm letting\nyou know in advance to avoid any\nmisunderstandings.\" These words warm\ntheir hearts. In this capital city, what\nimportant person would give prior\nnotice? If there was any noise, they\nwould have to figure out whether they\nshould go in to investigate. If they\nmisjudged, they would either be punished\nor killed. This young master way was a\ngood man. considerate of them. The guard\nimmediately bowed and replied, \"Young\nMaster Wei, rest assured I will notify\nthe others immediately. They will not\ndisturb you if they hear any noise.\"\nSensing the gratitude in the guard's\ntone, Wei Wu nodded slightly and did not\nask any further questions. After closing\nthe door, he walked back to the middle\nof the courtyard and waved his hand.\n\"Bang!\" With a muffled sound, a 40 foot\nlong red shipping container landed\nheavily on the ground. Chapter 10. If I\nhadn't transmigrated, I probably would\nhave been shot. Looking at the huge red\nshipping container in front of him,\nWayiwu was actually quite glad that his\nyard was spacious enough. A standard\nshipping container 12 m long and more\nthan 2 m wide and high would really not\nfit in an ordinary [clears throat]\nhousehold. At that moment, a small sense\nof anticipation rose within him.\nwondering what tricks the system had up\nits sleeve this time. Actually, this\nwasn't the first time he'd opened one of\nthese blind box boxes. Last time, he'd\nexcitedly opened it, only to be nearly\ndumbfounded. It was piled high with over\n3,800 boxes of instant noodles, 24 packs\nper box. In total, there were over\n90,000 packs of instant noodles. The\nflavors are plentiful, but for a modern\nperson, this stuff is nothing special.\nBesides, the quantity is so limited,\nit's unappetizing. There's no way you\ncould finish it all. Even if you ate\nthree packs a day until you died, you\nstill wouldn't use up this whole cabinet\nof instant noodles. But then again, even\nthough he doesn't like them, keeping\nthem might actually be useful. After\nall, times have changed. Anything edible\nis considered good. This time, he\ndecided to give his system another\nchance. Maybe it could produce something\ndecent. Taking a deep breath, he walked\nto the container and opened the door.\nThe scene before him left way. Woo\ncompletely stunned. The entire container\nwas crammed with military green metal\ncrates. These crates came in two sizes.\nThe smaller ones were neatly arranged,\nwhile the larger ones resembled coffins\nfor corpses. The key point wasn't the\nappearance, but rather that these\ncontainers looked like militaryrade\nammunition transport boxes. Weiiw stood\nat the door for a moment, then opened a\nsmall box to check. Sure enough, it was\nfull of bullets, and they were M2A1\nammunition boxes commonly used by the US\nmilitary, each holding 840 rounds. He\nopened another large crate and found an\nM4A1 assault rifle inside. Considering\nthe size of the container and the number\nof crates, Weii Wu began to calculate.\nAfter a while, he simply retrieved a\ncomputer from the systems inventory.\nAfter careful calculation, he arrived at\nthe result. 50 M4 A1 rifles, plus over\n400,000 rounds of 5.56 mm ammunition.\nSeeing this result, Wayi Woo couldn't\nhelp but complain about the system. I\njust met with old Ju and you sent me\nthis whole truckload of stuff. Are you\ntrying to make me start a rebellion?\nWith this setup, plus that pile of\ninstant noodles from before, you could\nindeed raise an army. Unfortunately,\nthat's just how this system is. Once the\nsupplies arrive, there's no followup and\nthere's no continuous supply at all.\nDespite his complaints, Wayiwi Woo still\nput the container back into the systems\nwarehouse. It definitely wouldn't need\nit now, but it might come in handy\nlater, like those tens of thousands of\npacks of instant noodles. Keeping them\nwasn't a bad thing. Having them and not\nusing them were two different things.\nThe courtyard was empty again, and Wei\nWoo sighed. Sigh. More things that are\ntemporarily useless. Oh well, I'll just\ncook some instant noodles for a midnight\nsnack. He went back inside, initially\nintending to just eat a bowl of noodles,\nbut remembering the guards outside, he\ndecided to make it a little more formal.\nSo, he used an induction cooker to cook\na large pot of brazed beef noodles, and\nthe aroma immediately filled the air.\nThe two men guarding outside couldn't\nhelp but swallow hard when they smelled\nit. The bearded man couldn't resist any\nlonger and whispered, \"Brother Shun,\nwhat is Young Master Way cooking? It\nsmells so good. It's making my mouth\nwater.\" Upon hearing this, the burly\nbrother Shan immediately reminded him in\na low voice, \"Stop talking nonsense.\"\nWhat young Master Wei does is not\nsomething we can ask about. Remember\nthat. The bearded man quickly stood up\nstraight and sat upright. However, just\nthen, Wayi Wu suddenly opened the\ncourtyard gate from the inside.\nBrothers, you've worked hard keeping\nwatch. I've cooked some midnight snacks.\nCome in and have a bite. These\nunexpected words stunned the two men. In\ntheir minds, keeping watch was a duty.\nTheir master preparing midnight snack\nfor them was unheard of. The two men\nstood frozen for several seconds before\nbrother Shin snapped out of his days and\nhurriedly clased his hands in a gesture\nof polite refusal. Young Master Wei, we\nare merely servants. How could we dare\nto ask you to prepare food for us?\nBesides, his majesty has issued an\nedict. Before he could finish speaking,\nWayi Wu raised his hand to interrupt\nhim. Didn't his majesty say that\nwhatever I ask you to do, you must do\nyour utmost to complete it. Right? The\ntwo men exchanged a glance and nodded.\nWeii Wu continued, \"Then I'll order you\nto come in for a late night snack. Also,\ncall the other brothers over. It's on me\ntonight.\" The two men looked hesitant,\nclearly still having reservations.\nSeeing this, we wu smiled and added,\n\"Don't worry, I'll take care of it.\" His\nmajesty won't make things difficult for\nyou. Brother Shan hesitated for a\nmoment, then finally nodded. However, he\nstill suggested, \"Young master, why\ndon't my brothers and I go in and eat\nwhile the others continue guarding? I'll\nsend some more out to them.\" \"All right,\ncome in.\" Weigh nodded, turning and\nleading the two to the place where they\nhad eaten hot pot during the day. The\npot of fragrant noodles on the table\nlooked incredibly tempting. Weu pointed\nto the bowls and chopsticks on the table\nand said with a smile, \"Don't be shy.\nEat as much as you want.\" Upon hearing\nthis, the two couldn't help but swallow\nhard and quickly filled two bowls to the\nbrim. They squatted down to start\neating. Weii Wu glanced at them and\ncouldn't help but laugh, saying, \"Aren't\nthere stools? Why are you squatting on\nthe ground?\" Brother Shan hurriedly\nwaved his hand. \"Those are the seats for\nthe emperor and empress. We can't\noverstep our bounds. We could just squat\nand eat.\" Wayi Wu knew that the ancients\nwere particular about these things, so\nhe didn't try to persuade him further.\nOnce he stopped talking, the two of them\nstarted eating. The moment the noodles\nentered their mouths, that familiar and\nrich aroma instantly assaulted their\ntaste buds, the bearded man barely\nchewed a few bites before swallowing a\nhole, a look of satisfaction on his\nface. By the second bite, Wayi Wu even\nthought the guy's eyes were red. In\ncomparison, Brother Shan was more\ncomposed, but he ate just as quickly.\nAfter taking the first bite, he looked\nat wei Wu with excitement, his eyes\nfilled with admiration and gratitude.\nYoung Master Wei, such a delicious dish\nand you've bestowed it upon two rough\nmen like us. I truly don't know how to\nthank you. Hearing this, we woos lips\ntwitched slightly. For instant noodles\nto be called a delicacy, that's probably\nthe highest praise in a niche audience.\nChapter 11. Even announcing the imperial\nedict requires me to wake up. Watching\nthe two wolf down their food, we woo\ncould understand. He himself had been\nstunned by the aroma of the seasoning\nwhen he first tried instant noodles. As\na young man conditioned by modern MSG\nand additives, he found it delicious.\nHow much more so would these ancient\npeople, especially for low-ranking\nguards like Shinllin and Jon Hai, their\ndaily diet consisted mainly of soy\nsauce, salt, and vinegar. Spices like\nSichuan peppercorns, black pepper, and\nstarannis were rarely even seen, let\nalone eaten. In their eyes, these\nseasonings were reserved for the wealthy\nand powerful. The taste of instant\nnoodles, which modern people would find\ntiresome, was a complete sensory\nexperience for them. Watching the two of\nthem stuffing their mouths, Wayi Wiu\nsuddenly felt like he was watching a\nmukbang eating broadcast. He'd long\nsince lost interest in instant noodles.\nBut seeing them eat so heartily, he\ncouldn't resist taking a bite himself.\nHe regretted it as soon as it entered\nhis mouth. The taste was merely enough\nto fill his stomach, offering no\nenjoyment whatsoever. We simply put down\nhis chopsticks and started chatting with\nthem. \"By the way, what are your names,\nbrothers?\" Brother Shan immediately put\ndown his chopsticks and respectfully\nreplied, \"Young master, my surname is\nShan and my given name is Lynn.\" The\nburly man with a full beard was not to\nbe outdone and quickly responded, \"My\nname is Jean Hai. Thank you for the\nmeal, young Masterway.\" Seeing the two\nof them looking a little awkward, we Woo\nsmiled and said, \"Don't stop. Let's eat\nand chat.\" Filling our stomachs is the\nmost important thing. Hearing this, Shin\nLin and Jean Hai immediately relaxed and\ncontinued to wolf down their food. In\nthe blink of an eye, the pot of 10\npackets of noodles was completely empty.\nNot even a drop of soup was left. He\ndidn't say much, but simply cooked two\nmore pots of noodles, continuing to chat\nas they simmered. They ended up talking\nlate into the night. By then, the two\npots of noodles were practically soup.\nBut Wayiu didn't care. His brothers\nwouldn't mind. He told Shinllin and Jean\nHai to take the pots out and distribute\nthem to the others as a late night\nsnack. He then went back to his room to\nsleep peacefully. After arriving in this\nera, Wayi Wu's lifestyle was incredibly\nfree. He could sleep whenever he wanted\nand eat whenever he was hungry,\ncompletely bidding farewell to the life\nof a wage earner. But this time, he\nhadn't slept long before being awakened\nby a noise. Although the sound wasn't\nloud, Wayiu was always sensitive to his\nsurroundings and immediately opened his\neyes. He went outside in his pajamas,\nand what he saw almost made him jump out\nof his skin. A group of people stood in\nfront of the courtyard gate, led by a\nunic holding a silk cloth. Behind him\nwere more than a dozen burly men,\nincluding Shunlin and Jean Hai. Weii Wu\nfrowned, \"What are you doing?\" The unic\nreplied politely and immediately. Young\nMaster Wei, his majesty has issued an\nimperial edict. Please receive it. Upon\nhearing it was an imperial edict, we wu\nfelt a wave of embarrassment. He thought\nto himself, \"Why didn't you give me a\nheads up before you came? How can I\nreceive an edict in my pajamas? What\nkind of decorum is this?\" Just as he was\nabout to ask to change his clothes, the\nunic quick to read his mind, explained,\n\"Young Master way, there's no need to\nworry.\" His majesty said that the edict\nwill be delivered after you've woken up.\nThere's no need to read it aloud. Simply\nbring the edict and I will read it aloud\nmyself. This whole process touched Wayi\nWu slightly. Oldju had clearly\nsimplified the procedure and shown great\nconsideration for the differences in the\ntimes. Judging from their expressions\nand the beads of sweat on their\nforeheads, they've been waiting outside\nfor quite some time. We wu nodded and\nasked, \"What is your honorable surname,\nUnic?\" The Ming dynasty had strict rules\nfor addressing Unix. Ordinary Unix were\ncalled Jong Wan, while those of higher\nstatus were given their surnames. Wong\nJehong Wan immediately replied, \"My\nsurname is Wong. Young Master Wei, you\nmay call me Unic Wong.\" Weii Wu nodded\ninwardly upon hearing this. This man was\ntruly sweet-talking. No wonder he could\ndeliver imperial edicts to the emperor.\nWong Jean Wan displayed the imperial\nedict in his hand and then asked, \"Young\nMaster Wei, may we move inside?\" Weii Wu\nstepped aside and led him into the\ncourtyard. As soon as he stood still,\nUnic Wong unfolded a silk cloth and\nsolemnly announced. His Majesty's decree\nstates that Prince Wei will enjoy\nspecial treatment when receiving the\nimperial edict and meeting the emperor\nand will not be required to kneel. After\nsaying this, he formally read the\nimperial edict. By the grace of heaven,\nthe emperor decrees, \"Heaven blesses the\ngreat Ming, and I have been granted the\nvirtuous and capable way woo by heaven.\"\nThe edict contained a lot of\ninformation, but it can be summarized\ninto two points. First, he was granted a\nnew residence and ordered to move in as\nsoon as possible. Second, to take care\nof his daily needs, he was provided with\na full 32 servants. The male servants\nincluded 12 handymen, three grooms, two\ngatekeepers, two page boys, and one\nsteward. There are also quite a few\nfemale servants, three maids for\nmaidservants, one cook, and four\npersonal maids. While the imperial edict\nwas being proclaimed, arrangements were\nbeing made quietly within the forbidden\ncity's inner palace. Empress Ma\npersonally summoned a young girl with\ndelicate features. Chapter 12. The first\nhalf of his life was spent as a beast of\nburden, the second half as a master. Zu\nYushwan, dressed in elegant palace\nattire, entered Cunning Palace under the\nguidance of a palace maid. She walked to\nthe center of the hall, neatly, folded\nher hands at her waist, slightly bent\nher knees, and bowed her head in\ngreeting. Her voice was as gentle and\nmelodious as a clear spring, and she\nsaid softly, \"May your majesty be\nblessed with long life and peace.\"\n\"Empress Ma smiled and waved\naffectionately,\" \"You is here. Quickly\ncome and sit next to mother. Thank you,\nMother Empress.\" She responded meekly\nand walked slowly to sit down beside\nEmpress Ma. The young girl looked timid\nand acted reservedly, which made Empress\nMaai inwardly. Yuan lost her mother at a\nyoung age and was always cared for by\nher. Although she treated her like her\nown daughter, they ultimately lacked the\nnatural intimacy of a mother and\ndaughter. In terms of personality, he is\nalso more calm and reserved than his\nother children. Emperor's Ma looked at\nher, sitting quietly, a hint of pity\nrising in her eyes. She reached out and\ntook the girl's slender hand, and\nwhispered, \"Yushwan, you are past your\nprime. It's time to get married. Your\nfather intends to choose a good match\nfor you. He and I have both met that\nperson. He is steady and reliable, but\nhis background is somewhat unusual, but\nmother thinks he can take good care of\nyou. As a princess, marriage is never\nsomething she can decide for herself.\"\nAnd Zu Yuwan is well aware of this.\nAlthough curious about what the person\nlooked like, she still responded softly.\nYour daughter will obey all arrangements\nmade by your father and mother. Her\nobedience made Empress Ma's heart\nclench. Her understanding nature made\nher all the more pitiful. After a\nmoment's hesitation, Empress Ma suddenly\nsmiled and spoke. \"Would you like to\nmeet him first?\" Zhu Yuwan&lt;unk&gt;s eyes\nflickered slightly and although her\nexpression did not change much, she\ncould not hide a hint of curiosity. She\nobediently replied, \"I will leave\neverything to mother.\" Empress Ma could\neasily discern her emotions. She smiled\ngently, her tone carrying a deeper\nmeaning. \"All right, then your mother\nwill make the arrangement for you.\" On\nthe other side, after Wong Xang Wan\nfinished dictating the imperial edict,\nhe handed the silk cloth to Wei Wu.\nYoung Master Wei, if you have any items\nyou wish to take, you may instruct them\nto move them. The move can be completed\ntoday. Wayu looked around and thought\nthat everything in the system could be\nstored in the warehouse, and the other\nthings were of little value. So, he\nsaid, \"Just move these things out of the\nyard. I'll take care of the things\ninside the house myself.\" Wong Jean Wan\nnodded and immediately ordered his men\nto begin the cleanup. Weii Wu then went\nback to his room and put all the system\nitems into the warehouse before changing\ninto clean clothes. When he went out\nagain, the yard had already been cleaned\nup, led by Wong Jong Wan. The group\narrived at the gate of the new house.\nYoung Master Way, this residence has\nfive courtyards and 10 courtyards\ncovering an area of 10 acres with a\nfront yard, backyard, garden, and\nrockery. The gate was open and Wei Wu\nfollowed Wong Jong Wan into the house.\nCrossing the small courtyard and passing\nthrough the inner wall, we officially\nentered the first courtyard. As he\nwalked, he looked around. The pond was\nclear, the corridor was deep, and exotic\nflowers and trees were scattered among\nthem. Chow Chow was deeply impressed,\nnoting that the sophistication and\nlayout of ancient residences were in no\nway inferior to the mansions of later\ngenerations. It is even superior in\nterms of practicality and aesthetics.\nAlong the way, Wong Jong Wuan gave a\ndetailed introduction to the layout and\npurpose of each part of the mansion.\nFinally, he was led to the core area,\nthe fourth courtyard, which is also the\nmost spacious and magnificent central\ncourtyard in the entire mansion. As soon\nas we woo stepped into the courtyard, he\nsaw a group of people waiting neatly in\nthe center of the courtyard. Wong Jong\nWan introduced, \"These are the servants\nbestowed by his majesty, a total of 33\npeople.\" Halfway through his sentence,\nWong Jong Wuan suddenly paused and his\ntone became somewhat unnatural. Weiiwan\nnoticed his pause and raised an eyebrow.\nDidn't you just say 32? How come it's 33\nnow? Wong Jong Wanurly explained, \"This\nhumble servant has overlooked something.\nHer majesty, the empress, sent an extra\nperson. In fact, Wongjan was also\nfeeling uneasy at this moment. No one\ninformed him that the princess was mixed\nin with the servants and dressed as a\nmaid, but he immediately realized what\nwas going on from the clothes and came\nup with this explanation in a moment of\ninspiration. After hearing the\nexplanation, Wei Wu had no doubts as\nEmpress Ma had always treated him well.\nSeeing that he believed him, Wong Jong\nWuan breathed a sigh of relief and\nturned to his servants, shouting, \"From\nnow on, young Master Way will be your\nmaster. You must serve him\nwholeheartedly and not be negligent or\nlazy. Do you understand? Understand? The\n33 people responded in unison. However,\nWong Jong Wan was immediately faced with\nanother problem. According to custom, a\nservant must kneel and bow when he first\nmeets his master. But now that there's a\nprincess in the group, how could he dare\nto make her kneel? Just as he was\nracking his brains about how to solve\nthe problem, Zhuwan suddenly took a step\nforward. Greetings, sir. She led the way\nin bowing, and the other servants\nfollowed suit, bending down to kneel.\nBefore anyone could kneel down, Wayi Wu\nimmediately waved his hand to stop them.\nJust bow from now on, you don't need to\nkneel at home. Just bow instead. Upon\nhearing this, the servants all stopped\ntheir movements and began to bow. We\ndidn't have much of a feeling about the\nservant system. After all, he was also a\ncorporate slave in his previous life.\nNow that they've turned the tables, they\nnaturally want to experience what it's\nlike to be in charge. But he didn't like\nthe whole kneeling ritual, so he simply\nskipped it. From now on, don't call me\nmaster, call me young master. Yes, young\nmaster. The crowd respectfully agreed.\nAt this moment, Wong Jehong Wan handed\nover a stack of papers. These are their\nindentures, young master way. Please\nkeep them safe. If you find someone you\nlike, you can go to the government\noffice to have your name removed from\nthe register. We nodded and carefully\nput away the contract. Wong Jonguan\nbowed slightly. After this matter is\nsettled, I will return to the palace to\nreport back. Weii Wu escorted into the\ndoor, then suddenly flipped his hand and\ntook out a small sample of perfume,\nhanding it to him. Unic Wong, you've\nworked hard. Please accept this small\ngift. Wong Jong Wuan smiled with\nnarrowed eyes, gladly accepted the gift,\nand took his leave. After everyone left,\nWayi Wu turned around and immediately\nremembered that he hadn't drawn the\nsystems express delivery today. Oh, I\nalmost forgot. It's time for today's fun\nblind box event. Chapter 13. Moving into\na mansion surrounded by beautiful young\nwomen. Upon returning to the mansion,\nWayi Wu found the servants still\nstanding in the same spot. It's all\nright. You can all go back to your own\nbusiness. Upon receiving his order, the\nservants dispersed. Just as Wei Wu was\nabout to return to his room, he\ndiscovered that there were still five\nyoung girls who hadn't moved. I was\nabout to ask when I suddenly remembered\nthat Wong Jong Wan had said there were\nfour maids among the servants. In\naddition, the emperor sent exactly five.\nMaids and servants are different.\nServants do rough work and hard labor,\nsuch as washing clothes and cleaning.\nbut made are there specifically to serve\ntheir masters and take care of their\ndaily lives. They don't need to do those\nstrenuous tasks. Looking at the five\nyoung women in front of me, four of them\nwere not stunningly beautiful, but they\nwere still young and pretty. After all,\ntheir age is a factor. They're all so\nyoung and fresh. As for the remaining\none, it's not in the same league or at\nthe same level as the previous four. She\nhad a pair of bright almond-shaped eyes,\nwhite teeth, and a face as beautiful as\na peach blossom with fair skin that had\na rosy glow. What's even more remarkable\nis her elegant and gentle temperament,\nmore like a young lady from a wealthy\nfamily than a maid. At this moment, Wayi\nWu suddenly felt a surge of emotion.\nIt's not that I lack willpower, but\nrather that this wicked, feudal society\nmakes it too easy for people to fall\ninto depravity. Of course, while you may\nwant to think about it, there are some\nthings you should ask about beforehand.\nWhich of you is sent by the empress? As\nsoon as she finished speaking, the\nprettiest of the five maid step forward,\n\"Young master, it's me.\" Weii Wu\nexamined it carefully for a moment, then\ncontinued to ask, \"May I have your\nname?\" \"Young master, my name is\nYushuan. Your name is very beautiful.\"\nAfter saying that, Wayi Wu looked at the\nother maids and asked, \"And what are\nyour names?\" The remaining four maids\nwere clearly different from Yucen. Upon\nhearing Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s question, they\nexchanged glances. And then one of the\nolder women stepped forward. Please\nbestow a name upon me, young master.\nOnly then did Wei Wu remember that they\nwere all slaves and that when they\nchanged masters, their masters usually\ngave them names. Originally, Chow Chow\nplanned to name the child after Plum\nBlossoms, orchids, bamboo,\nchrysanthemums, or the four seasons. But\nthen I thought it was too ordinary. You\ncould probably find a whole company of\nthose in the capital. Thinking of this,\nWayi Wu lowered his head and fell\nsilent. Logically speaking, naming my\ncourier system STTO Express, YTO\nExpress, ZTO Express, and Yend Express\nwould be most appropriate, but after\nall, they're all girls. After much\nhesitation, Wayi Wu finally decided to\ncommemorate the beauty of the world. So,\nyour name is Ching Shia. Your name is\nLeah. Your name is Naza. And your name\nis Dilaba. Ching Xia is the one who just\nanswered. She's 16 years old, quite\ntall, and has an oval face. Leo was\nabout the same age as Bridget Lynn, also\n16, and had a proud bust at a young age.\nNaza and Dabba are a bit younger. Naza\nis 15 years old and has a round face, a\nbit like a chubby bun. Doraba is only 14\nyears old and she may be a little thin\ndue to poor nutrition. After naming the\nmaids, Weii Wu led them into the main\nroom where his master lived. Weii Wu\nfrowned as he glanced at the room's\nlayout. Reeba, go and call a few\nservants over. Move everything out of\nthis room except for the bed and the\nwooden cabinet. Yes, young master. I'll\ngo right away. Not long after, Doraba\ncame in with five or six servants. Under\nWei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s command, all the things he\ndisliked were moved out of the room.\nSeveral maids looked at the empty room,\nwondering what we Woo was doing. Weii Wu\nwas too lazy to explain to them, so he\nsent all five of them away before\nstarting to make arrangements. Arrange\nlong sofas, single sofas, Sha's lounges,\nand beanag chairs. A luxuriously styled\nstorage coffee table arrangement, a\nfluffy coffee table rug arrangement, a\nPS5, and an extra-large curved screen\narrangement. After arranging all his\nvaluable items, Wayi Wu took out solar\npanels and a power bank. There's no\nother way. This is the only thing that\nallows him to play games. So, we have to\narrange it as soon as possible. A solar\npanel can generate 3 kwatt hours of\nelectricity per day, while a portable\npower bank can store 20 kwatt hours of\nelectricity. It seems sufficient, but in\nreality, the screen and PS5 together\nconsume about 4 kwatt hours of\nelectricity per day. After everything\nwas arranged, Weii Wu then summoned his\nfive maids. The five girls were filled\nwith shock as they looked at the strange\nthings that had suddenly appeared in the\nroom. They didn't recognize these\nthings, nor did they know when they had\nbeen moved in. I didn't see anyone come\nin or out. It was always the young\nmaster alone in the room. However\ncurious they may be, they all understand\none thing. Never ask questions that\nshouldn't be asked. This is their\nironclad rule for survival. Otherwise,\nthey would have no choice but to accept\nbeing beaten to death by their\nemployers. Just as the girls were\nmarveling at this, Wu suddenly spoke up.\nThese things can't get wet. When you\nwipe them, try to ring them out as much\nas possible. Okay? And the same goes for\nthis blackboard and that black box\noutside. These things are very valuable,\nso be careful. In addition, every day\nwhen the sun comes out, we take this\nblack board out and put in the sun to\ndry. While giving the instructions, Wayi\nWoo demonstrated the operating procedure\nin front of the group. Actually, these\nare not difficult at all. They're all\nsimple, foolproof operations. Open the\npanel, then plug the solar panel into a\npower bank. You'll get the hang of it\nafter one try. As for hiding it, Wayi\nWoo never even considered it because\nthere was simply no need for it. These\nfive girls took care of his daily life\nand could be considered his personal\nmaids. They'll find out sooner or later\nanyway, so it's better to teach them\nsooner and let them get used to it. From\nnow on, he can simply enjoy life and\nwon't have to worry about these trivial\nmatters. After giving these\ninstructions, Wayi Wu sprawled out on\nthe sofa, letting his body sink into it.\nPhew, that feels great. He stretched\nlazily and looked at the five curious\ngirls beside him. Weii Wu&lt;unk&gt;s lips\ncurled into a wicked smile and then he\nspoke. You guys should try sitting in\nit, too. I guarantee you'll want to sit\nin it twice after just one time. Hearing\nWei Woos words, the five girls hesitated\nfor a moment, but in the end, they\ncouldn't resist their curiosity. The\ngroup arrived at the sofa, and Yu Suin\nwas the first to sit down. She had\nbarely sat down when she let out a gasp\nand jumped up. H. Seeing Yu Suin's\nreaction, the other four girls were all\nfrightened and hesitated to sit down.\nWayi Wu, meanwhile, was slapping his\nthigh and laughing loudly. He wasn't\nused to this sofa when he first sat on\nit, mainly because it was too soft. When\nyou first sit down, you feel a sudden\nloss of weight, but you get used to it\nafter a while. Even he, a modern person,\nhas this problem, let alone these\nancient people who have never sat on a\nsofa. Yuin's exclamation was probably\ncaused by not realizing she was losing\nweight. Haha. All right. This thing is\njust a bit soft. You'll get used to it\nonce you sit down. Hearing Weii Wu&lt;unk&gt;s\nlaughter, Yusian blushed deeply, her\npink and tender face looking incredibly\ncute. However, she then slowly sat down\nas Wei Wu had instructed. It was the\nfirst time I had ever experienced the\nfeeling of being completely enveloped in\nsoftness. She finally understood why we\nwoo had looked so comfortable earlier.\nBefore they could enjoy it for long,\nthey heard we woo&lt;unk&gt;s voice again. I\njust remembered I haven't eaten since I\nwoke up. Let's go. We're having hot pot\nagain today. Chapter 14. Whenever\nthere's hot pot, old Jew comes running\nas soon as he smells it. Hot pot is not\na suitable dish to be eaten in a room.\nOtherwise, the whole house will smell\nlike hot pot and it will take a long\ntime for the smell to dissipate.\nTherefore, after making the decision, we\nimmediately began to make arrangements.\nChing Shia, go and tell the cook to\nprepare some green vegetables and bean\ncurd sheets. Wash them clean and peel\nand slice this. As he spoke, Wayi Wu\ntook out a few potatoes and handed them\nto Chingsha. Then looked at Leah. Leah,\ngo and arrange for the servants to bring\nback those tables and chairs that were\njust moved out and put them in the yard.\nNaza and Dabba, you and Bridget go to\nthe kitchen together and get some cups,\nbowls, and chopsticks. Also, bring my\npot with you. Just as Weu finished\ngiving his instructions, Yusian suddenly\nstood up. Young master, what do I need\nto do? You You don't need to do\nanything. Just stay here with me, young\nmaster. Yian was sent by the empress, so\nher status was different from that of\nthe other maids. Out of respect for\nEmpress Ma, Wayi Wu did not intend to\nassign her any tasks. It's absolutely\nnot because she's pretty or because\nhaving her around makes it more pleasing\nto the eye. Absolutely not. After the\nmaids left, Weii Wu told Yusen to\ncontinue sitting on the sofa and wait\nfor him. He left the living room and\nwent to his bedroom alone. It's time for\nthe most exciting part of the day again,\nthe lucky draw. What big prize will be\ndrawn today? Let's wait and see. With a\nthought, the image of the system\nwarehouse appeared in his eyes. Looking\nat the three packages floating in\nmidair, Wayi Wu once again began to\nmuster his troops. Ultimately, with the\nhelp of great metaphysics, the middle\npackage was chosen. The next second, a\ncardboard box the size of a refrigerator\nappeared in front of me with the words\nxx optics printed on it. Optics? Do they\nsend me a whole box of telescopes? With\na thought, the cardboard box appeared in\nthe room. When we wu opened the box, he\nfound that it contained not a telescope,\nbut four slightly smaller boxes. There's\na box within a box. Has the system been\nmalfunctioning lately? he muttered a\ncomplaint under his breath. Then opened\nthe four small boxes again. Now we\nfinally know what it is. It is indeed a\ntelescope, but an astronomical\ntelescope. The four astronomical\ntelescopes have magnifications of 100x,\n200x, 300x, and 600x respectively. To be\nhonest, this thing was of little use to\nWei Wu, but it was quite useful to Zu\nYuan Jang. Firstly, it can broaden old\nJews horizons and allow him to truly see\nwhat the moon actually looks like to\nprove to these ignorant ancients that we\ndo indeed live on a big sphere or rather\na water sphere. Secondly, all of these\nastronomical telescopes are refracting\ntelescopes. In other words, they could\nbe used not only to look at the stars\nbut also to enjoy the scenery. Take a\n200x telescope for example. Given the\nair quality of this era, seeing people\nwithin 5 km is not a problem, and seeing\nbuildings is particularly clear within 8\nto 10 km. In a context of warfare, all\nthat's needed is to find a high location\nor build a platform. It's perfectly\nfeasible to observe enemy troop\nmovements within a 20 km radius. All\nright, we'll just leave this thing here.\nWhen we have time later, I'll take Lau\nto see the moon tonight. How\nembarrassing. Everyone else brings their\nsweethearts to moon viewing, but I'm\nbringing an old man. Or maybe I should\nbring Yushuan, too, since there will be\nfour of us. With these thoughts in mind,\nWayi Wu left the room and returned to\nthe hall. Yushuan, don't go to bed too\nearly tonight. Come to the young\nmaster's room. I'll show you a good\ntreasure. Yen was staring at Wei\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s game screen with a curious\nexpression. Upon hearing this, her face\nimmediately turned red again. Young\nmaster, you said I could stay tonight. H\nyoung master is good to you. This is the\nfirst treasure I've shown to you. Enough\nsaid. Let's eat first. After saying\nthat, we wu led the blushing Yusen out\nof the room. Outside the door, the four\ngirls had already arranged the things\nWei Wu had asked them to do and ate a\nmortal table and several stools were\nplaced in the middle of the courtyard.\nOn the table were Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s alcohol\nstove and a pot specifically for hot\npot. Seeing this, Wayiu immediately\nturned around and went back into the\nhouse, emerging with a large pile of\nthings in his hands. Two packets of\nHalleo hot pot base, three bottles of\nCoke, and five or six packets of frozen\nbeef and lamb rolls. Although he knew\nthese were all synthetic meats, he had\nno control over them. They were all open\nfrom packages. Besides, we're living in\nthe Ming Dynasty now, so having enough\nto eat is good enough. There's no need\nto pursue a bicycle. Amidst the\nastonished gazes of the women, Weii Wu\ndemonstrated what it meant to witness a\nmiracle. He pulled a lighter from his\npocket and with a click, a flame rose\nfrom his hand. Upon seeing this, Leah\nwas so frightened that the weight on her\nchest trembled violently. Then, Wayi Wu\nlit the solid alcohol and threw it into\nthe stove, and several girls immediately\ngathered around. Lea raised her hands in\nsurprise, her arms squeezing her chest\nout of shape. Young master, you can\ncontrol flames? That's nothing. I cannot\nonly control flames, but also their\nsize. Oh, what size? The size of a\nflame. What else could it be? After\nsaying that, Wayi Woo turned on the\ncontroller, and the flame sometimes\nswelled up and sometimes turned into\nsmall flames. He only played with it for\na short while, teased him a bit, and\nthen put the lighter down, then pour\nwater into the pot, add two packets of\nbutter base, and soon the aroma will\nwaft out. Even Yuan couldn't help but\nswallow hard when she smelled the rich\naroma of the hot pot. The other four\nwomen stared longingly at the hot pot,\ntheir eyes practically, practically\ndrooling with anticipation. It's almost\ntime to add the ingredients. Weii Wu\nglanced at the bubbling red oil, picked\nup a plate of beef rolls, and poured\nthem directly into the pot. Then they\nadded bean curd sheets and green\nvegetables, making the hot pot even more\nfragrant. Just as he was about to\nannounce that they were going to start\neating, a voice came from outside the\ncourtyard gate. We could smell the hot\npot from far away. Shiao Wu, you're\neating hot pot all by yourself again\nwithout even inviting us. Weii Wu looked\nin the direction of the sound and saw\nZhu Yuan Jang leading a young man of\nabout 30 years old into the courtyard.\nUncle Zhu, I'm eating this perfectly\nlegitimately. Besides, you're so busy.\nHow could I dare to bother you? As Wei\nWu spoke, he didn't forget to glance at\nthe person next to Old Ju. There weren't\nmany young people who could follow Zu\nYuan Jang, let alone bring them to him.\nBarring any unforeseen circumstances,\nthis person should be Zu Bao, the most\nstable crown prince in history. This\nmust be his highness, the crown prince.\nThis humble subject, Weii Wu, greets\nyou. Before Wei Wu could finish\nspeaking, Zu Bao interrupted him with a\nsmile and a wave of his hand. Since\nyou've already called me Uncle Zu, you\nshould call me Brotherh Zu, right? Upon\nhearing this, we wu also smiled.\nBrotherhu, I didn't expect you and Uncle\nZu to come. We just cooked hot pot.\nWould you like to have a bite together?\nAt this moment, the girls around wei Wu\nfinally came to their senses and knelt\ndown in unison. Just as he was about to\nshout, Zhu Yuan Jang waved his hand. All\nright, everyone, leave. We don't need\nyou here. Zu Yuan Jang was completely\nstunned when he saw Yusian dressed as a\nmaid in the crowd halfway through his\nspeech. Not only was he stunned, but\neven the crown prince Zhuao beside him\nwas equally stunned. Chapter 15. a\ndignified princess of the Ming dynasty\nactually refers to herself as a servant.\nWhat old Ju was thinking was, \"What's\ngoing on? How did my perfectly healthy\ndaughter end up dressed as a maid and\ncome here to weigh Wu&lt;unk&gt;s place?\" What\nShiao was thinking was, \"What's wrong\nwith dad? He actually sent his sister to\nsomeone else's house and to be a\nservant, no less.\" The two then\nexchanged a glance. \"Old Zu, I don't\nknow about this either. Shiao, my dad\ndoesn't know about this. With just a\nbrief exchange of glances, they\ncompleted the information exchange in an\ninstant. However, since they were the\nemperor and the crown prince, although\nthey were initially taken back, they\nquickly understood what had happened.\nThe image of Empress Mai immediately\nappeared in their minds. Actually, it's\nnot entirely fair to say that Lao Zhu\nand Shiao Zhu were unaware of this.\nAfter all, only Empress Ma had the\nability to accomplish such a significant\nfeat as a princess, leaving the palace\nto disguise herself as a maid. Wong Jong\nWuan believed that Empress Ma would\ndefinitely tell Emperor Zhu about this.\nSo, he didn't say anything when he\nreturned to the palace to report, and\nthat's how this scene came about.\nMeanwhile, Zhuan also did not expect Zhu\nYuan Jang and Zu Bao to come at this\ntime. Seeing their expressions, she\nimmediately lowered her head, ready to\nbe reprimanded. Interestingly, the two\nof them only glanced at her before\npretending they knew nothing. Yuan\nfinally breathed a sigh of relief. To be\nhonest, she didn't know what she was\nworried about, whether it was being\nreprimanded or having her identity\ndiscovered by Wei Wu. At that moment,\nZhu Yuan Jang spoke again. \"Yushwan,\naren't you serving our sister in the\npalace? How did you end up here?\"\nAlthough Zu Yuan was timid, she was not\nstupid. When he heard Zu Yuan Jang use\nthe word serve, he knew that his father,\nthe emperor, was not going to expose\nhim. So he composed himself before\nbowing and responding. It was her\nmajesty, the empress, who ordered me to\ncome here to serve young Master Wei.\nUpon hearing Zhu Yuwan&lt;unk&gt;s answer,\nboth Zhu Yuan Jang and Zhu Bao couldn't\nhelp but twitch at the corners of their\neyes. For a princess of the mighty Ming\ndynasty to refer to herself as a servant\nin front of her father and brother is\ntruly appalling. Fortunately, the two\nonly complained in their hearts. Then\nZhu Yuan Jang said again, \"All right,\nyou can stay and serve. Everyone else,\nget out.\" \"Yes, your majesty.\" The four\ngirls immediately stood up and\nretreated, but their eyes couldn't help\nbut show some disappointment as they\nlooked at the hot pot. After the women\nleft the courtyard, Zhu Yuan Jang turned\nto look at Wayi Wu. Xiao Wu, I brought\nBow here today because I wanted him to\nhear what you've said. As he spoke, Zhu\nYuan Jang led Zhu Bao to sit down at the\ntable, and Zhu Yuan Jang skillfully\npicked up a slice of fatty bee from the\npot and put in his mouth. He then more\nskillfully unscrewed a bottle of cola\nand poured it directly into his mouth.\nBurp. Bow, you eat, too. Don't be shy\nhere with Xiao Wu. We're all family.\nUpon hearing the phrase, \"We're all\nfamily.\" Wayi Wu didn't think much of\nit, assuming it referred to the\nrelationship between nephews and nieces.\nBut Zu Yuwan, who was standing to the\nside, bit her red lips and lowered her\nhead with a blush on her face. We didn't\nnotice anything unusual about Zuyuan.\nUpon hearing what Zu Yuan Jang said, he\nimmediately began to greet Juao. That's\nright, brother Zu. This is something\nthat most people can't get their hands\non. You should try it. I guarantee you\nwon't be disappointed. As he spoke, Wayi\nWu reached out, opened a bottle of cola,\nand handed it to Zuao. However, this\ndish is a bit spicy. You might not be\nused to it at first, but you can drink\nsome cola after eating to relieve the\nspiciness. Zuao had drunk Coke last\nnight, and although it wasn't much, he\nstill knew what it tasted like. He took\nit from Wei Wu, but did not drink it\nimmediately. Instead, he placed it\naside. Following Zhu Yu and Jang&lt;unk&gt;s\nexample, he picked up his chopsticks and\ntook a slice of fatty beef from the pot.\nHis next reaction was the same as Zhu Yu\nand Jang&lt;unk&gt;s the day before. At first,\nhis taste buds were overwhelmed by the\nstrong seasoning, and the rich flavors\nmade him unable to resist starting to\nchew. But what followed was spiciness. A\nspiciness far exceeding that of dogwood,\nbursting in the mouth. This Shia with\nthis hot pot is so spicy. I've never\neaten anything this spicy before. Under\nthe impact of the spiciness, Zhu Bao had\nno choice but to grab a can of cola and\ngulp it down. In an instant, that\npeculiar, explosive taste burst forth in\nhis mouth. Zhu Yuan Jang had almost\nfinished a bottle of cola from\nyesterday, while Zhu Bao only took a\nsmall sip. The taste of cola is\ncompletely different when you take a\nsmall sip versus a large sip. The\nsensation of countless tiny bubbles\nbursting in his mouth instantly\ncaptivated Juao. However, Zhu Yuan Jang\nhad told him that even Chiao Chow didn't\nhave many of these, so he didn't say\nanything. He didn't speak, but Zu Yuan\nJang did, and he went straight to the\npoint. Xiao Wu, what exactly did you\nmean by that little ice age you told me\nabout yesterday that would reduce crop\nyields? Weiiu was stuffing meat into his\nmouth when he heard Ju Yu and Ja&lt;unk&gt;s\nwords and had to stop eating at that\nmoment. He even suspected that Zhu Yuan\nJang was doing it on purpose just to\nprevent him from grabbing meat. After\nall, we was not afraid of spicy food and\nate quickly. While Zhu Yuan Jang needed\nto drink a sip of water to relieve the\nspiciness after each bite. However,\nsince the emperor had spoken, he had no\nchoice but to give up eating and begin\nexplaining. The Little Ice Age was\nsimply a period of dramatic changes in\nweather and climate with winters\nbecoming colder and more frigid than\never before. In this climate, plant\ngrowth will be inhibited and most crops\nwill even be frozen to death by the\ncold. Upon hearing Wei Woos explanation,\nZuao immediately stopped eating and\nlooked over. In this era, food was the\nlifeblood of a country, and as the crown\nprince, he would naturally attach great\nimportance to it. So after Wei Wu\nfinished speaking, he immediately asked\na question. Then why did this many ice\nage occur? And why did it only happen in\nour dynasty? Upon hearing this, Wei Wu\nsighed deeply. \"Brother Zu, I'm sure\nUncle Zu has already told you about my\nbackground, right?\" Zhu Bao nodded and\nthen Wei Wu turned to look at Zuyuan.\nOriginally, the idea was to have Zhu\nYuan leave first since the fewer people\nwho knew he came from the future, the\nbetter. Since old Ju didn't tell her to\nleave, it meant there wouldn't be any\nproblems. Moreover, to be honest, Wayu\nalready considered Juu Yusuan as his\nwoman. With such a beautiful woman in\nhis home, he would never let this prize\nslip away. At worst, I could go to Emma\nand beg her to let Yu Yuan marry me.\nThinking of this, Weii Wu smiled\nslightly, but still offered a reminder.\nYusen, just listen to what I'm about to\nsay. Don't explain it to Chinga and the\nothers. Okay. Zhu Yushuan was already\ncurious about Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s background\nand immediately nodded when he heard him\nsay that. Don't worry, young master. I\nwill definitely keep your secret. Upon\nhearing Yusian&lt;unk&gt;s answer, we wu\nturned to look at Juba. Brotherhu, as\nyou know, I am not from the Ming\ndynasty, but from a future generation\n600 years from now. Clang. As soon as\nWayi Wu finished speaking, the sound of\nbowls and chopsticks falling to the\nground came from the side. Looking back,\nhe saw Zhu Yuswan staring at him with\nher mouth wide open, her body stiff, and\nher face full of shock. Chapter 16. Old\nZu, \"Want to see the outer world? I'll\nhelp you.\" Wayi Wu had anticipated Zhu\nYuan&lt;unk&gt;s reaction given that what he\nhad said was too shocking. He\ndeliberately mentioned his time travel\nstory first, specifically for Zhu Yuan\nto hear. Fortunately, Xiuwan only showed\nshock, not fear. Seeing this, Weii Wu\nstood up, patted her head, and then\npicked up the bowls and chopsticks on\nthe ground before returning to his seat.\nBrotherhu, let me answer your second\nquestion first. The Little Age did not\nonly occur in the Ming Dynasty. In fact,\naccording to research conducted in our\ntime, there were three little ice ages\nbefore a dynasty. These periods are the\nlate Shang dynasty to the early\nwesternhao dynasty, the late Easter\ndynasty to the three kingdoms and\nwestern gene dynasties and the late Tang\ndynasty to the five dynasties and early\nnorthern song dynasty. Every time a\nlittle ice age occurs, it causes turmoil\nand dynastic changes. At this point, we\nwu paused for a moment as if to give\nthem time to process the information.\nOnly after the two men's brows relaxed\ndid we woo speak again. If you send\nsomeone to carefully examine the\nhistorical records, you should be able\nto find some records of climate from\nvarious dynasties. But that's all in the\npast. Now, I'm going to talk about the\nfourth little ice age, which is now the\nMing dynasty. The little ice age from\nits beginning to its peak and end spans\nseveral hundred years. This time, there\nwere actually signs as early as the Yuan\ndynasty, but no one thought about it in\nthis era. Upon hearing that there were\nsigns beforehand, Zhu Yuan Jang\nimmediately asked for clarification.\n\"What kind of omen is this? Why have I\nnever heard of any omen appearing?\"\n\"It's a natural disaster,\" Wayi Wu said\nin a deep voice with a focused\nexpression. According to the summary of\nour time, during the 100-year reign of\nthe Yuan dynasty, there were a total of\n450 natural disasters. 92 floods, 86\ndroughts, 69 hail storms, 61 locust\nplagues, 52 earthquakes, 42 windstorms,\n28 frost and snowstorms, and 20\nepidemics. And in my great Ming dynasty,\nfrom his majesty to Emperor Chongjin, a\ntotal of 1,1 natural disasters occurred\nin 276 years. At this point in Wei\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s speech, Zhu Yuan Jang&lt;unk&gt;s\nexpression turned extremely ugly. The\nnumber of natural disasters that\noccurred in the Ming dynasty was more\nthan several times that of the Yuan\ndynasty. While Zhu Yuan Jang was\nemotionally agitated, we wu continued to\nspeak. Finally, theQing dynasty was even\nworse. From the sixth emperor, Chiian\nWong to the abdication of the last\nemperor, a total of 1,12 natural\ndisasters occurred over a period of 176\nyears. In other words, the little ice\nage began in the early Yuan dynasty,\nreached its peak in the Midming Dynasty,\nand gradually disappeared only after the\nfall of theQing dynasty. This was the\nfirst time Zhu Bao had heard of the\nManchu Ching dynasty, but he could\nroughly guess that it was the dynasty\nthat followed the Ming dynasty. But\nthat's not what he's most concerned\nabout right now. What he's really\ninterested in is the Little Ice Age.\nSimilarly, this was also the issue that\nZhu Yuan Jang was most concerned about.\nSo he immediately asked about it. Shiao\nWu. So why did this little ice age occur\nand how did later generations deal with\nit? After Zhu Bao finished speaking, he\nlooked at Wayi Wu with anticipation. But\nWayi Wu simply shook his head. In our\ntime, technology was so advanced that we\ncould even say we could reach for the\nmoon in the heavens and capture dragons\nin the deep sea. Of course, there are no\ndragons in this world. It's just a way\nof saying that technology is very\nadvanced. After making a casual remark,\nWayi Wu continued his explanation.\nHowever, even in my advanced era, there\nwas no clear explanation for the\nformation of the Little Ice Age. There\nare only two guesses. One is that the\nEarth's rotation and periodic tilting of\nthe angular axis led to a reduction in\nsunlight, which triggered a mini ice\nage. As he spoke, Wayi Wu pointed to the\nsun in the sky. Another factor is the\nchange in solar cycle activity which led\nto a decrease in solar activity and the\nonset of the little ice age. Seeing the\nbewildered expressions on old Zu and\nlittle Zu's faces, Wayi Wu could only\nsmile bitterly to himself. Actually, he\nreally didn't want to talk about these\nthings since it would be like casting\npearls before swine to them, let alone\nold Zhu and little Zu. Even we woo\nhimself only knew these terms. The\nspecifics of periodic activity and angle\nof inclination were completely foreign\nto him, but he couldn't stay silent, so\nhe simply said it all. At that moment,\nZhuao asked a rather classic question.\nXiao Wu, what kind of ball is the Earth?\nHow can we stop it from spinning? That's\nright. Zuao didn't know what the Earth\nwas, but he knew what the sun was.\nObviously, the sun was beyond their\nreach, so they set their sights on the\nEarth. on Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s side. Upon\nhearing Zhu Bao's question, he was\nunsure whether to laugh or feel\nhelpless. Brotherhu, the Earth, which is\nthe land we are standing on, is actually\na giant sphere. Not only is the Earth a\nsphere, but the sun, the moon, and all\nthe stars in the sky are also giant\nspheres. These words startled not only\nZhu Bao, but also Zhu Yuan Jang and Zhu\nYuwan, who were standing nearby. Zu Yuan\nJang even stood up. Absolutely.\nFrom ancient times to the present. The\nsky has always been flat and the earth\nis square. How could the earth be a\nsphere? If it really were a ball,\nwouldn't we all fall down? Shiao Wu,\nwhat you're saying is utterly absurd.\nAfter Zhu Yuan Jang finished speaking,\nZhu Bao, who was standing beside him,\nalso spoke up. Shiao Wu, I don't\ndisagree that the sun, moon, and stars\nare spheres. But I find it hard to\nbelieve that the earth is also a sphere.\nIf the earth is indeed a sphere, as you\nsay, then what about rivers, lakes, and\nseas? Water flows downhill. Weii Wu had\nlong anticipated their reaction, and he\nwas not surprised at all. After all,\nit's inevitable to feel unable to accept\nthe sudden disruption of one's\nestablished way of thinking. Seeing the\ntwo men's agitated state, Wayi Wu\nhesitated for a moment before speaking.\nI can explain all of this, but I'm\nafraid that even if I do, Uncle Zu and\nBrother Zu, you'll find it hard to\nunderstand. Actually, whether it's the\nsun and moon, the stars, or the earth,\nthey all float in a dark, empty space.\nThat's the point. If you want to know, I\ncan use technology to show you the world\noutside the sky and what the moon really\nlooks like after dark. You'll understand\nwhen the time comes, but before it gets\ndark, let's talk about how to deal with\nthe little ice age. Upon hearing that\nthey could see the outer world with\ntheir own eyes, both Zhu Yuan Jang and\nZu Bao trembled. That's beyond the\nheavens, the place where immortals live.\nHow could they, mere mortals, possibly\nget a glimpse of it? Even Juwan, who was\nstanding to the side, stared intently at\nWei Wu, her eyes full of anticipation,\nbut she dared not utter a word. Seeing\nthis, Wayi Wu chuckled and looked at Juu\nYuwan, asking Yusuan, \"Do you believe in\nthe young master?\" \"Believe.\" Zhu Yusuan\nnodded subconsciously. She didn't know\nwhy. It was just an instinctive\nreaction. Upon hearing this, we wu\nlaughed loudly and said, \"Do you\nremember what the young master just told\nyou?\" I remember the young master said\nnot to go to bed too early tonight, but\nto go to his room. He has a treasure to\nshow me. Upon hearing this, we wu&lt;unk&gt;s\nface immediately darkened. This girl,\nit's enough that you said you\nremembered. Why did you have to repeat\nwhat I said again? If Lao Zhu and Xiao\nZu hear this, my image will be\ncompletely ruined. When we Wu turn\naround, the expressions on Zhu Yuan Jang\nand Zu Bao&lt;unk&gt;s faces were extremely\nstrange. Chapter 17. Two ways to cope\nwith a little ice age. Seeing this, Wayi\nWoo put one hand to his forehead, his\nexpression somewhat embarrassed. Um,\ndon't get me wrong, the treasure I'm\ntalking about is technology. That's\nright. The technology from outer space.\nAfter Wei Wu finished speaking, Zu Yuan\nJang immediately spoke up. It's all\nright. It's all right. It's just that\nyou're still young, so try not to get\ninvolved with women before you get\nmarried. You should take good care of\nyour health. No, I really don't. Before\nWei Wu could finish speaking, Zhu Bao\ninterrupted him. All right. All right,\nbrother. Zu has been through this\nbefore. I understand, but some things\nare better done after the wedding. Don't\nyou think? To be honest, Wayiu was a\nlittle confused by the two of them. Even\nthough they were saying things to advise\nme, it always felt like there was a\nthreat in their voice. I don't want to\ndo anything either. At most, he would\ntouch Yuwan's little hand or hug\nYuwanuan's slender waist for a while and\nmaybe give her a kiss. If possible, let\nit proceed naturally. As he pondered,\nWei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s thoughts completely drifted\noff course. Cough, cough, cough. At the\ncritical moment, a deep cough sounded,\npulling him back to reality. When Wei Wu\ncame to his senses, he noticed that\nthere was something wrong with the way\nthe two looked at each other, and he\ncouldn't help but feel a little uneasy.\nThis is my May mine. Your Zhu family\neven controls this. Not only will they\nnot let me touch them, but they won't\neven let me lay a finger on them. Wayi\nWu silently complained to himself for a\nwhile, feeling wronged. His attention\nwas entirely focused on Zhu Yuan Jang\nand Juao, but he didn't notice that Zu\nYuan next to him was blushing so much\nthat he was practically steaming. A pair\nof delicate white hands gripped the hem\nof her clothes tightly. The poor piece\nof fabric almost torn to shreds. Those\nbig watery eyes stared at the floor, but\nevery now and then they would glance at\nWei Wu. He looked like he wanted to see,\nbut was afraid of being discovered. It's\na good thing Wei Wu didn't see it.\nOtherwise, he would have had to find a\nway to send old Ju and little Zu away.\nThen, late at night, he would enjoy the\nmoon alone with a sweetheart. It's a\npity he didn't see it, but Zu Yuan Jang\nand Zu Bao saw it very carefully. Seeing\nZhu Yuwan like this, the two of them\nwere actually quite happy. Royal\nprincesses were always married off by\nimperial decree, so there was no\nquestion of whether they liked or\ndisliked each other. But Juwan's current\ndemeanor clearly indicates that she has\nfeelings for Wei Wu. It's undoubtedly a\ngood thing that my daughter or sister\ncan marry someone she likes. It's not\nsurprising that Zhu Yuwan fell in love\nas women in ancient times had limited\nopportunities to meet men and even fewer\nchoices. Therefore, it is often easier\nfor love at first sight to happen. We\nwoo&lt;unk&gt;s unconventional personality and\nforwardthinking insights easily created\nan attractive effect. Cough, cough,\ncough. Seeing that the atmosphere in the\ncourtyard was a bit strange, we woo\ncoughed twice and spoke again. Okay,\nlet's continue talking about how to deal\nwith the little ice age. Actually, the\nmethods are very simple. There are only\ntwo. One sentence immediately drew the\nattention of Zhu Yuan Jang and Zuao.\nWeii Wu then continued, \"The first thing\nis heating.\" \"Uncle Zhu must have\nnoticed that the winters have become\nincreasingly cold in recent years.\" Zhu\nYuan Jang nodded. Indeed, he was not an\nemperor who only stayed in the palace to\nenjoy himself. He would occasionally\ncome out to inspect the people's\nconditions. This is why he was able to\nmeet Weii Wu in the outskirts of the\ncapital. Seeing Zhu Yuan Jang nod, Wei\nWu continued, \"A chimney stove can not\nonly boil water and cook rice, but also\nmake the house warmer, thus resisting\nthe cold. If that's not enough, we can\npromote the heated Kong beds in the\nnorth, which only require simple stones,\nbricks, and yellow mud.\" After Wei Wu\nfinished speaking, Zhu Bao suddenly\ninterjected. I know about heated brick\nbeds. People in the north use them in\nwinter, but how are those chimneys and\nstoves made and can people afford them?\nUpon hearing this, Wei Wu smiled. The\nchimney stove is simple to make. You\njust need to add a chimney to a normal\nstove and let extend outside. It can be\nmade with thin sheet metal. If all else\nfails, you can make it with yellow mud\nand bamboo tubes. But bamboo tubes don't\ndissipate heat well, so the temperature\ninside the room will be lower than that\nof sheet metal. Chimies and stoves are\nnot difficult to make. After we woo\nexplained it, Zhu Yuan Jang and Zhu Bao\nunderstood. Never underestimate the\nwisdom of the ancients. They discovered\nand understood many things very early\non. However, due to limitations imposed\nby the times and other factors, it was\nnot able to be popularized or studied in\ndepth. With the heating issue resolved,\nZhu Bao couldn't help but ask\nimmediately, \"What about the second\nmethod? There is enough grain to feed\nall the people of the Ming dynasty. When\npeople are wellfed, they are less afraid\nof the cold. Upon hearing this answer,\nZhu Yuan Jang and Zhu Bao couldn't help\nbut sigh. They understood this principle\nall too well. But it was harder than\nclimbing to heaven to feed all the\npeople of the Ming dynasty, especially\nZhu Yuan Jang. Didn't he understand that\nonly by eating well can one resist the\nsevere cold? He understood. He\nunderstood better than anyone else\nbecause his whole family had starved to\ndeath. Therefore, Zhu Yuan Jang was\nactually somewhat dissatisfied upon\nhearing Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s words. In his view,\nwhat Wayu was saying was nothing but\nempty talk and unrealistic. However, at\nthat moment, Wei Wu suddenly blurted out\na sentence. It's a coincidence that I\nhappened to have a solution to the food\nproblem. As soon as we Wu finished\nspeaking, Zhu Yuan Jang and Zhu Piao\nstood up abruptly. even shaking the\ntable. If Wayi Wu hadn't reacted quickly\nenough, the hot pot would have spilled\nall over the place again, just like last\ntime. However, just as he stood up, he\nfound that Zhu Yuan Jang and Zu Bowo had\nalready come to him. The two men grabbed\nhis left hand and his right hand with\nsuch force that he felt his arm getting\ncongested. But you can't blame them for\nbeing so agitated. You must know that\nwhat Wayu just said was to ensure that\nall the people of the Ming dynasty were\nwellfed. For Zhu Yuan Jang, nothing was\nmore important than ensuring that the\npeople were well-fed. Territory and land\nwere not important either. Looking at\nthe two excited people, Weii Wu said\nwith a helpless expression, \"Uncle Xu,\nBrotherhu, could you please let me go? I\ncan't speak properly like this.\" Upon\nhearing this, the two released each\nother, but remained close to Wei Wu,\nwaiting for his next words. Weu picked\nup his chopsticks and scooped a potato\nslice from the hot pot, suspending it in\nmidair. This is what will ensure that\nthe people of the Ming dynasty have\nenough to eat. After saying this, we wu\nhanded the potato directly to Zhu Yuan\nJang, indicating that he should taste\nit. Previously, Zhu Yuan Jang always ate\nbeef rolls and rarely touched the\nvegetables in the pot. Only then did I\nrealize there was something else in the\npot. So, I reached in and grabbed a\npotato and put in my mouth. It has a\nsoft and chewy texture and tastes good,\ntoo. What's this called? Zu Yuan Jeang\nchewed and commented. Clearly quite\nsatisfied with the potatoes. It name is\npotato, but I prefer to call it potato.\nHowever, the name doesn't matter. What\nmatters is that this thing doesn't\nrequire much soil. It is not only cold\nresistant and droughtresistant, but also\nhas very low requirements for climate\nand environment. It could be grown in\nalmost any kind of land as long as there\nis water. Of course, that's not the most\ncrucial point. Its real strength lies in\nits production capacity. Upon hearing\nthe word production, Zhu Yuan Jang and\nZu Bao immediately held their breath and\ntension because this is the most\ncritical issue regarding food security.\nChapter 18, The Famine Miracle. Potatoes\narrive. But just as the two were waiting\nfor Wei Woo to reveal the answer, he\nsuddenly picked up a can of cola. Of\ncourse, he didn't do this on purpose. He\nwas just really thirsty after talking\nfor so long. After waiting for Wei Woo\nto finish drinking, Zhu Yuan Jang\nfinally heard the answer he wanted most.\nThe yield of potatoes per mu in our time\nwas 3 to 5,000 gene, depending on the\nfertility of the soil and the climate.\nAccording to the weight conversion of\nthe Ming dynasty, it is between 25 and\n41. Sure his even Zhu Yuan Jang the\nemperor forgot his imperial dignity when\nhe heard about this output. He gasped\nsharply in front of Wu. Zhu Bao standing\nto the side was completely dumbfounded\nhis mouth agape wide enough to fit an\napple. Why does this expression appear?\nIt's very simple because during the Ming\ndynasty, the grain yield per moo unit of\nland area was only two to three sure\nunit of dry measure converted to\nkilogram. One moo unit of land area only\nproduces two to 300 kg of grain. Even\nthat depends on the land conditions and\nclimate conditions. It's entirely up to\nthe heavens. Wayi Wu also knew that Zu\nYuan Jang and Zhu Bao would be shocked\nby this, but he just wanted to see how\nthis emperor who started with only a\nbowl looked so unsophisticated.\nHowever, just as Wayi Wu was secretly\nlaughing to himself, Zhu Yuan Jang\nsuddenly grabbed him by the neck with\nboth hands. You brat, you actually ate\nsuch important grain seeds. You actually\nate them. I'll strangle you, you\nheartless brat. How many people could\nthis save? Is there no meat? Huh? Why\nare you eating it? As Zu Yuan Jang\nspoke, he shook Wu&lt;unk&gt;s head. Weii Wu,\non the other hand, followed Zu Yuan\nJang&lt;unk&gt;s movements, his head bobbing\nback and forth. Upon seeing this, Zhu\nBao and Zhu Yusuan quickly stepped\nforward. One pulling Zhu Yuan Jang and\nthe other protecting Wei Wu. Actually,\nthey were just being overly nervous.\nAlthough Zhu Yuan Jang had Wei Woo in\nhis grasp, he didn't exert any real\nforce. The purpose of doing this is\nsimply to vent one's excited emotions.\nAs an emperor, he had to maintain his\ndignity, but the appearance of potatoes\ncertainly made him lose his composure.\nMeanwhile, we also noticed that Lao\nZhu's strength was completely in sync\nwith his actions. Zu Bao immediately\nrealized this when he tried to stop Zhu\nYuan Jang. Of the four people present,\nZhu Yuan was probably the only one kept\nin the dark. After Wei Wu and Zhu Yuan\nJang parted ways, Zu Yushuan reached out\nand stroked Weii Wu&lt;unk&gt;s neck with\nheartache. As those soft, smooth little\nhands slid across his neck. Weii Wu felt\nincredibly happy. Before transmigrating,\nI was a corporate slave working hard\neveryday to make a living, and I had no\ntime or money to date. If we're really\ngoing to count, if he confirmed his\nrelationship with Zu Yuan, this could be\nconsidered his first love. After the\nbrief farce, Zhu Yuan Jang stared\nintently at Wei Wu. He knew that Wei Wu\nhad the ability to manipulate objects\nfrom thin air and that there must be\npotatoes that could be used as seeds. In\nfact, Weii Wu did not disappoint him. He\nreached out and swiped and a large sack\nof potatoes fell to the ground. Uncle\nZu, I didn't count the potatoes in this\nbag, but there are about 50 or 60 of\nthem, and the weight is about one sure a\nunit of dry measure. In the current\nclimate, you just need to soak them in\nwater overnight and then take them out\nand leave them for a few days. Once\nsprouts grow on its surface, you can cut\noff a small piece of the sprout and use\nit for planting. While Weii Wu was\nspeaking, Xiuan Jang&lt;unk&gt;s eyes remained\nfixed on the sack full of mud. In his\neyes, nothing in the world was more\nprecious than it. Even Zhu Bao, who was\nstanding to the side, had his eyes\nshining and was extremely excited.\nMeanwhile, Weii Wu continued to explain\nthe information about potatoes. The\ngrowth cycle of potatoes is not long,\nabout 60 to 90 days, depending on the\nsoil and environment. Uncle Zu, you can\ndesignate some fertile land as imperial\nestates, specifically for cultivating\npotatoes to facilitate future promotion.\nThe Little Ice Age has only just begun\nand the climate has not yet had a\nsignificant impact on crops. Now is the\nbest time. However, when promoting in\nthe future, it needs to be explained\nthat sprouted potatoes contain trace\namounts of toxins and it is best not to\neat them. Upon hearing we wu mention the\nmatter of promotion, Zhu Yuan Jang\nsuddenly remembered an important issue.\nShia Woo. Are there any special\nconsiderations for storing potatoes and\nhow long can it be stored? Under normal\ncircumstances, it can be stored for\nabout a month. In cold regions, it can\nbe stored in a cellar for about 6\nmonths. Upon hearing this answer, Zhu\nYuan Jang&lt;unk&gt;s smile deepened. This is\npractically a godsend for food crops to\ncope with a little ice age. But Juu Yuan\nJang&lt;unk&gt;s joy was short-lived, for he\nheard Wayi Wu continue, \"If potatoes are\nmade into potato flour, they can be\nstored for about 3 months under normal\ncircumstances, which is also a good\nfood.\" Then Wayi Wu explained how to\nmake potato noodles again. It's really\nsimple. You can remember it after\nhearing it just once. Just as Wei Wu was\nhaving a lively conversation with Zhu\nYuan Jang and Zhu Bao, Zhu Yusuan\nwatched him from his side, her beautiful\neyes almost glazed over. In later\ngenerations, if Wayiu were to talk to\nwomen about what he's saying now, he\nwould only be called an idiot, boring,\nand a leerous man. But in this era, in\nthe eyes of Zhuwan, who lives in this\nera, he shines. Knowing the past a\nthousand years and the future 500 years,\nunderstanding astronomy and celestial\nphenomena as well as geography and\npeople's livelihoods. This was an\nirresistible attraction for women in\nancient times. Just as Zhu Yuan was in a\ndays, Zhu Yuan Jang&lt;unk&gt;s loud voice\nsuddenly came from the side. Weii Wu,\nyour offering of these grain seeds can\nensure that my great Ming will never\nagain suffer from famine. Tell me, how\ndo you wish me to reward you? Upon\nhearing this, we woo fell silent. The\nmain problem is that he genuinely\ndoesn't know what he wants, and he\nreally doesn't want to work in official.\nIt was full of cunning old foxes. He\nknew he couldn't outsmart them. In terms\nof material things, he has a system for\neating, drinking, defecating, and\nsleeping, and is completely\nself-sufficient. The key is that the\nemperor's bestowil of rewards depends on\nthe emperor's will, not on whether you\nactually ask him to say what you want.\nSeeing wei Wu remain silent, Zhu Yuan\nJan assumed he was deep in thought. In\nfact, he genuinely wanted to know what\nwe wu wanted and he was also truly\nwilling to give it to him. Besides the\nfact that we ws achievements were indeed\ngreat, it could also be considered a\nkind of benevolent test. From Wei\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s needs, we can indirectly see\nwhat he is more interested in. However,\nWei Wu remained silent. Just then, Zhu\nYuwan, who was standing next to him,\nsuddenly spoke up. She, who is usually\ntimid, suddenly mustered up the courage\nto say something in a low voice. Young\nmaster, we are sure to money a home. The\ncook bought vegetables on credit today,\nand we can't even pay the servants\nwages. Moreover, we don't own shops or\nfarmland, so we don't have a stable\nincome. If this continues, we might end\nup running out of money. Upon hearing\nZhu Yusuan's words, Zhu Yuan Jang and\nZhu Bao&lt;unk&gt;s expressions changed once\nagain. She's not even married yet, and\nher elbows are already starting to droop\noutwards. Meanwhile, Weii Wu, upon\nhearing Zhu Yuwan's words, also realized\nthat he was no longer alone. I used to\nlive alone and as long as I was fed, the\nrest of the family wouldn't go hungry.\nBut now the family still has more than\n30 servants. And there is also Zhu Yuan\nwho is the intended young mistress. So\nafter Zuyuan finished speaking, he\nimmediately raised his head and looked\nat Zhu Yuan Jang. Your majesty Wu has\nonly recently arrived in a Ming Dynasty.\nApart from that small courtyard, he has\nneither property nor savings. I need\nmoney. Furthermore, I have another\nrequest that I hope your majesty will\ngrant. To me, this matter is more\nimportant than money. Chapter 19. The\nJapanese pirates deserve to be\nexterminated. Upon hearing Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s\nwords, Zhu Yuan Jang immediately became\ninterested. In his eyes, Weii Wu was\nlike a person with no desires. He\nneither wanted to be an official or\nwield power, nor did he engage in\nbusiness to make money. His temperament\nwas calm and uneventful. But now it's\nactually making demands on itself and\neven emphasizing how important it is.\nSince you want money, we'll give you\nmoney. As a reward for Wei Woo, we'll\ngive him 5,000 tales of gold, 30,000\ntales of silver, and 50,000 strings of\npaper money. In addition, you will be\ngranted 2,000 acres of fertile land,\nthree shops in the capital, two\nrestaurants, and one tea house, all\nlocated in the heart of the city. I'm\njust curious. Given your generally lazy\nnature, what could possibly make you ask\nus for something? After Zhu Yuan Jang\nfinished speaking, he kept staring at\nWei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s expression, but they found\nthat he was not happy at all. On the\ncontrary, his face was serious and his\neyes were filled with anger. Just as he\nwas wondering what was going on, Wayi Wu\nspoke up. Your Majesty, I remember in\nthe second year of the Hong Wu reign,\nyou sent someone to the Japanese\npirates, but the envoy was brutally\nmurdered by them, right? Zhu Yuan Jang,\nwho had been smiling, had his smile\nvanish instantly upon hearing this. He\ndid send envoys, but the seven who went,\nonly two returned alive. He then sent\nanother envoy the following year, who\nwas nearly killed again, which\ninfuriated him greatly. Now that We Wu\nhas brought this up, how could his\nexpression possibly improve just as Xu\nYuan Jang remained silent? Weii Wu spoke\nup again. My request is that the Ming\ndynasty should send troops to fight the\nJapanese pirates at an appropriate time,\nand the sooner the better. Zhu Yuan Jang\nfrowned as he looked at Wayi Wu, and\nafter a long while, he spoke. When a\nJapanese pirates killed our envoy, we\nalso planned to send troops, but we had\nno advantage in terms of timing,\nlocation, or popular support. The Yuan\ndynasty twice sent troops to the east.\nBut they encountered storms and tsunamis\nat sea, which not only caused great loss\nof manpower and resources, but also\nresulted in the deaths and injuries of\ncountless soldiers. The entire court\nused this as a reason to admonish the\npeople. And in addition, the Ming\ndynasty had just been established, and\neverything was in need of rebuilding, so\nthe people needed to recuperate. There\nare still remnants of the former Yuan\ndynasty. If we rashly launch a\nlarge-scale military campaign to the\neast, it will only give these remnants\nan opportunity to take advantage of us.\nOtherwise, given our temperament, if\nthey dare to kill our Ming Dynasty\nenvoy, we could simply wipe out that\nmere island nation. Weii Wu also\nunderstood that given Zhu Yuan\nJang&lt;unk&gt;s explosive temper, he would\nnever swallow this insult unless there\nwas absolutely no other way. What he\nneeds to do now is to find a way to\npersuade Zhu Yuan Jang to turn his\nattention to the Japanese pirates. So\nafter Zu Yuan Jang finished speaking, he\nimmediately continued. Now that the Ming\ndynasty is at peace, the remnants of the\nformer Yuan dynasty are nothing to fear.\nThe Ming dynasty is fully capable of\nconquering the country in the east. Upon\nhearing this, Zhu Yuan Jang shook his\nhead and remained silent. But Zhu Bao,\nwho was standing to the side, spoke up.\nThe Japanese pirates live in a small\nbarren land far overseas. To launch a\nrash campaign will be a waste of\nresources and manpower and would not be\nworth the effort. As the ruler of a\ncountry, father emperor cannot govern\nthe country based solely on personal\nwhims. He must prioritize the overall\nsituation. Moreover, all the civil and\nmilitary officials will surely fight to\nthe death to dissuade him from this\nmatter. In fact, we wu understood that\nwhether it was Zu Yuan Jang or the civil\nand military officials, ultimately there\nwas no mutual benefit involved. They\nfelt that even if the Japanese pirates\nconquered that small area, it wouldn't\nmake a difference. Not only can it not\ngrow crops, but it is also inconvenient\nto manage, making it a complete waste of\nresources. So, at this point, Wayi Wu\nknew it was time to throw out the forts.\nYour majesty, what if I told you that\nthere's an inexhaustible mountain of\nsilver over there by the Japanese\npirates? Upon hearing this, Wayi\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s small courtyard instantly fell\nsilent. You could hear a pin drop.\nHowever, that wasn't the end of it.\nAfter discarding four twos, Wayi Wu\nimmediately threw out a royal flush.\nAccording to later records, this silver\nmountain was continuously mined for more\nthan 400 years with a peak output of 38\ntons per year. All right, ton is a unit\nof weight in our later generations. One\nton is equal to 2,000 caddies. So, 38\ntons is 76,000 caddies of silver. In our\ngreat Ming dynasty, one gene is equal to\n16 leong, which means that the silver\nmountain can produce more than 1 million\nleong of silver every year. Upon hearing\nthat the annual output was 1 million\ntales of silver, not only Zhu Yuan Jang,\nbut even Zhu Bao became as breathless as\nan ox. During the Hong Wu era, the\nannual tax revenue of the Ming dynasty\nwas approximately 20 million tales of\nsilver. In other words, the silver\nproduced by a single silver mountain\nalready reaches 120th of the amount\nproduced by a country. Most importantly,\nthe majority of tax revenue came from\ngrain, which was all in cash. The\nthought that so much of his money was in\nthe hands of the Japanese pirates made\nJu Yuan Jangs eyes turn red. Xiao Wu,\nyou can't make up lies just because you\nwant to send troops to attack the\nJapanese pirates. Everything you said is\ntrue. After Zhu Yuan Jang finished\nspeaking, Zhu Bao, who was standing next\nto him, also spoke up. If this is true,\nI am confident that I can persuade all\nthe civil and military officials, and\nthen no one will stand in the way of\nattacking the Japanese pirates. Upon\nhearing their words, we wound nodded\nsolemnly. I can guarantee that\neverything I said is true, and besides\nthe Awami Ginsen, the Japanese pirates\nalso have a gold mine. According to\nlater surveys, the reserves of this gold\nmine are approximately 260 tons, which\nis equivalent to 8 million tales of\ngold. After defeating the Japanese\npirates, we don't need to treat them\nlike human beings. We should send them\nall to the mining areas to mine for our\ngreat Ming dynasty. They should risk\ntheir lives to mine for us. Zu Yuan Jang\nand Zhu Bao were, after all, the emperor\nand the crown prince, so they were quite\ngood at cultivating their composure.\nAfter the shock of the Awami Ginszen\nincident, I've calmed down now. Hearing\nthat there was a gold mine, I was happy,\nbut I didn't lose my composure like I\ndid before. Money is certainly good, but\nwhat Zu Yuan Jang is more curious about\nnow is what Wei Wu is thinking. Xiao Wu,\nyou've been urging us to send troops\nagainst the Japanese pirates. It can't\nbe because of these minerals. So, what\nis it? As soon as Zhu Yuan Jang said\nthis, Zhuao and Zhu Yuan both looked at\nhim. Seeing this, Wayiu took a deep\nbreath and then slowly spoke. On\nSeptember 18th, 1931, the Japanese\nGuandong army launched a surprise attack\nand began an invasion of China. During\nthe subsequent 14 years of the war of\nresistance against Japan, the number of\nChinese compatriots who died under the\nbrutality of these beasts reached as\nhigh as 35 million. In his majesty's\npresent day Ingion Prefecture, which is\nthe Nanjing of later generations, these\nbeasts slaughtered more than 300,000\ninnocent people here. At this point,\nWayi Wu&lt;unk&gt;s eyes were filled with\nferocity, his bloodshot eyes brimming\nwith hatred. Faced with events that had\nnot yet occurred, the three members of\nthe Zhu family could not empathize with\nWei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s feelings. At this moment,\nZhu Bao sighed as he looked at Wayi Wu\nwhile Zhu Yuan stepped forward and\ngently patted Wii Wu&lt;unk&gt;s back to help\nhim catch his breath. Only Zhu Yuan Jang\nstood still, his eyes filled with rage\nand fury. He was a man who had\nexperienced the battlefield, an emperor\nwho had crawled out of piles of corpses.\nHe was well aware of the meaning behind\nthose coal numbers and how tragic and\nshocking the scene was. Although those\nwho died were not his people, they were\ndescendants of Yin and Huang of the\nChinese bloodline. How could he possibly\naccept being slaughtered by Japanese\npirates from such a small island? Just\nthen, Wayi Wu&lt;unk&gt;s voice came from the\nside again. Therefore, I hope your\nmajesty will grant me permission to\naccompany the army to the battlefield\nwhen we attack the Japanese pirates. I\nwant to personally build a magnificent\nmound of skulls. When the gold and\nsilver mines are exhausted in the\nfuture, I hope your majesty will grant\nyour request to exterminate these\nbeasts. Upon hearing this, Zhu Yuan Jang\ntook a deep breath. I grant your\npermission. Chapter 20. Zhu Yuan Jang\nonly deserved to eat instant noodles\nwhile little Sweetie was allowed to eat\ncrayfish. Upon hearing Zhu Yuan\nJang&lt;unk&gt;s reply, Wayi Wu breathed a\nsigh of relief. After all, in this era,\nit's okay for people to die in war. But\nmassacres will be condemned by\nintellectuals. He worried that Zhu Yuan\nJang would reject his proposal because\nof this concern. Fortunately, Lau played\nexceptionally well this time. But just\nas Xu Yuan Jang finished speaking, Zhu\nBao suddenly spoke up. Father, you\nmustn't. If you really order the\nmassacre of an entire nation's people,\nyou will surely be condemned for all\neternity. Upon hearing Zhu Bao&lt;unk&gt;s\nwords, Zhu Yuan Jang simply waved his\nhand dismissively. It doesn't matter.\nLet them kill us. The more renowned our\ntyrants reputation becomes, the higher\nyour prestige will be in the future.\nThat's how Zhu Yuan Jang was. No matter\nwhat he did, he always thought of his\neldest son. However, no sooner had Zhu\nYuan Jang finished speaking than Zu Bao\nspoke again. Father, what I mean is you\ndon't need to give the order personally.\nIt's not worth leaving a bad name for\nthose beasts. Once war breaks out, this\nmatter will be handled by your son. I\nwill ensure that Father Emperor's\nreputation is not tarnished. Weu watched\nfrom the side, secretly amused. That's\nright. This is the real Zhu Bao.\nKind-hearted, benevolent, those are all\njust an act for others to see. Anyone\nwho actually thinks Zhu Bao is kind is\njust full of nonsense. The four major\ncases during the Hong Wu reign resulted\nin a large number of deaths, three of\nwhich were personally supervised by\nZhuao. It's just that he died early,\notherwise the fourth one would have been\nthere, too. Of course, even if he hadn't\ndied, there wouldn't have been a fourth\none. Under Lao Zhu's careful toutelage,\nhow could Zu Bao possibly become a\ncharacter full of kindness? Now that he\nhad received Zhu&lt;unk&gt;s approval, Weii Wu\nfelt relieved. He picked up his\nchopsticks to eat, only to find that the\nhot pot had boiled dry. Only then did\nWei Wu realize that several hours had\npassed without him noticing and the sky\nhad darkened. Twice. Twice we tried to\neat hot pot and both times we didn't get\nto eat hot pot. Old Jew, you're really\ncommitting a sin. Wayu looked at the hot\npot with a sense of wanting to cry. But\nhaving no tears, inwardly cursing Old Zu\nfor doing something inhuman, but there's\nnothing we can do about it. Compared to\nwhat he's talking about, hot pot is\nreally nothing. Left with no other\nchoice, we had to move the hot pot aside\nand take out a new pot to add water. At\nthe same time, he took out a few packets\nof instant noodles from the warehouse,\nintending to just grab a quick bite.\nHowever, at this very moment, Zhu Yuan\nJang started to stir up trouble again.\nShia Wu, you still haven't told me about\nthe generational naming system from\nyesterday. Why is it old? Before Xu Yuan\nJang could finish speaking, Wayi Wu\ncould no longer hold back and\ninterrupted him. Uncle Zu, at least look\nat the sky in this pot. It's completely\nburned dry. Can't you see? It's all\nburned dry. I haven't been able to eat a\nsingle hot bite since I woke up. Please,\nof pity on me. You are the emperor. You\ncan't let your soldiers go hungry. I\nonly had a bite of meat yesterday, and I\nhaven't had a single bite today. If I\ndon't get a hot meal today, I'll feel\nlike I've let that pot down. Upon\nhearing Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s complaints, Zhu\nYuan Jang realized that Weii Wu had been\ntalking the whole time. He didn't get a\nsingle bite to eat. And most\nimportantly, he didn't expect that we wu\nhadn't eaten anything yesterday either.\nWe woo is a precious treasure now. If he\nwere to starve, it would be a loss for\nthe entire Ming dynasty. To be honest,\nonly Way Wu could do that. In this era,\nwho would dare to speak to Zhu Yuan Jang\nlike that? The emperor is the greatest\nemperor. And even if you starve to\ndeath, you still have to answer the\nemperor's questions first. Just then,\nZhu Bao chimed in saying, \"Yeah, Dad.\nI'm starving, too. Let's eat something\nfirst, and we can ask you later if we\nneed anything.\" After winning over Zu\nYuan Jang, Wayi Wu took out a packet of\ninstant noodles from the warehouse. But\nthen he thought of Zhu Yuan Jang and Zu\nBao and immediately took out five\npackets of flour. While waiting for the\nwater to boil, he didn't stop working.\nHe went back inside and brought out the\nfour astronomical telescopes. While\nverbally instructing Zhuan to unpack and\ncook noodles, he squatted on the ground,\nassembling the telescope. Fortunately,\nthe lens barrel and lens are readily\navailable. All that's needed is to\nassemble the frame. He assembled the\nfour astronomical telescopes in a short\ntime. I looked up at the sky. Although\nit wasn't dark yet, the moon had already\ncome out. Just as he was holding the\ninstruction manual, preparing to adjust\nthe angle and lens, the instant noodles\nwere cooked. The rich aroma lingered in\nthe courtyard, making the mouths of the\nthree members of the Zhu family water.\nThis time, however, no one tried to take\nthe food from Wu. The three of them\nwatched him pick noodles from the pot.\nOnly after he finished picking through\nhis food did Zu Yuan Jang begin to use\nhis chopsticks, filling his bowl to the\nbrim. Zhu Bao then joined the noodle\npicking line. while Zhu Yuwan stood by\npitifully watching. Her current status\nis that of a maid, and she has no right\nto pick food from the pot in front of\nthe emperor and the crown prince. At\nthis moment, Zhu Yuwan was actually\nhoping that we wu would take the\nopportunity to reward her with a bowl of\nnoodles. Unfortunately, when she looked\nat Wayi Wu, their eyes met and she\nconveyed her meaning. Weii Wu shook his\nhead, rejecting Zhu Yuan's expectations\nwith his actions. Although she felt a\nlittle disappointed, Zhu Yuwan did not\ncomplain. Instead, they believed that\nway Wu was protecting them since how\ncould a maid servant eat with the\nemperor. But what was the actual\nsituation? It was that way Wu never\nintended for Zu Yuwan to eat this.\nWhat's so good about instant noodles?\nHow could you feed this junk food to the\nwoman you booked? After Old Zu and\nLittle Zu leave, they will naturally\nbring out some good things for Little\nSweetie to eat. A few months ago, Wayi\nWoo opened a cold chain package\ncontaining five bags of crayfish. Even\nprepackaged ready-made meals are a\nculinary marvel in this day and age. A\nlevel of culinary superiority that is\nalmost overwhelming. Wayi Wu had been\nsaving it up for months without being\nable to bear eating it, but now he could\nuse it to treat his sweetheart. As for\nLao Zhu and his group, although instant\nnoodles were junk food for Wei Wu, but\nfor Lao Zhu and Shiao Zhu, it was a\ndelicacy. Even though they probably\ndidn't like crayfish, you can tell this\nfrom the way they look right now. Look\nhow much they're enjoying their food.\nThe aroma is intense and pungent, and\nthe rich broth compliments the chewy and\nspringy texture of the noodles. At this\nmoment, no delicacy could compare to\nthis bowl of instant noodles. Wayu only\nate a small bowl before stopping, which\nwas less than the amount of a packet of\nnoodles. However, Zhu Yuan Jang and Zu\nBao were both highly respected figures\nat the very top of the Ming dynasty's\nhierarchy. They actually finished off\nall six packets of noodles. Xu Yuan Jang\nalone ate about four packets. Finally,\nthe two of them split the soup and drank\nit all up. After eating and drinking his\nfill, Wayiu picked up the instruction\nmanual and adjusted the angle and lens\nof the telescope. Then looking at the\ntwo people who were clutching their\nstomachs in pain, he smiled and said,\n\"Uncle Zu, brother Zu, this is the\ntechnology one told you about before,\nbut it's just one of the products of\ntechnology. It can show people the world\nbeyond the heavens and what the moon\ntruly looks like. Are you two ready?\nChapter 21. Tonight, I'll take Zhu Yuan\nJang to stargaze and admire the moon,\nthe outer world, the true appearance of\nthe moon.\" Upon hearing just those two\nwords, Zhu Yuan Jang and Zhu Bao&lt;unk&gt;s\nstomach ache subsided. He stood up\ndirectly from the chair and walked\nquickly to Weii Wu. Weii Wu pointed to\nthe row of astronomical telescopes in\nfront of him and slowly began to speak.\nThese are astronomical telescopes and\nthey are 100x, 200x, 300X, and 600x\nrespectively. I've already adjusted the\nangle. Just point your eyes at this\nsmall hole and you'll see what you want\nto see. As they were talking, Weii Wu\nled Zhu Yuan Jang to the 100X telescope\nand instructed him on how to observe and\noperate it. Then, following Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s\ninstructions, Zhu Yuan Jang closed one\neye and pressed his eye close to the\nsmall hole. What came into view was a\ngrayish white sphere riddled with holes\nsurrounded by complete darkness. Upon\nseeing this scene, Zhu Yuan Jangs world\nview was about to explode, and his mind\nwas filled with turbulent waves. To be\nhonest, Zhu Yuan Jang initially didn't\nbelieve that this thing could clearly\nsee the moon. However, the facts were\nundeniable, and he had no doubt that\nwhat he was seeing was the moon. He had\nonce seen a particularly large moon with\nsome strange black spots on it. He\ndidn't know what it was before, but now\nthat he sees this scene, he suddenly\nunderstands. After leaving the\ntelescope, Zhu Yuan Jang immediately\nwent to a 200x astronomical telescope to\ntake a look. The moon appeared half the\nsize it was before, but it was clearly\ncloser to the viewer. Not only are the\ndetails more detailed, but even the\nblack spots can be seen as small round\npits. Zhu Yuan Jang then moved again,\nthis time to the side with 300 times the\nspeed. This time, we couldn't even see\nhalf of the moon. We could only see a\nportion of it. However, the small pits\nhave become larger, and the protruding\nedges of the pits can be clearly seen.\nFinally, Zhu Yuan Jang arrived in front\nof the 600X telescope. He didn't check\nimmediately, but instead took a few deep\nbreaths. I closed my eyes to compose\nmyself, then leaned down to look at the\ncamera. The camera zoomed in again, and\nthis time he could even see what the\nbottom of the pit looked like. After\ngetting up again, Zhu Yuan Jang remained\nsilent for a long time before turning to\nlook at Wayi Wu. I want to see other\nstars. Can I see them from here? Yes,\nbut other stars are too far away. You\ncan only see the whole picture, not as\nclearly as you can see the moon. It's\nall right. I just want to see if the\nworld beyond the heavens is as you\ndescribed. This time, Wayi Wu did not\ntake the initiative to help Zhu Yuan\nJang adjust the angle. Instead, they\ntaught him how to do it, letting him\nadjust the settings himself to find the\nstars he wanted to see. This operation\nis very simple. You just need to point\nthe finder scope at the star you want to\nsee, then turn the knob to adjust the\nheight and then adjust the focus until\nit becomes clear. Zu Yuan Jang learned\nhow to operate it very easily. During\nZhu Yuan Jang studies, Wayi Wu\noriginally wanted Zhu Bao and Zhu Yuan\nto also look at the moon. For reasons\nunknown, Zhu Yuan Jang intervened and\nstopped it. Subsequently, Zhu Yuan Jang\ntook over all four astronomical\ntelescopes, busying himself with their\noperation. Weii Wu didn't know what he\nwas doing, and it wasn't convenient for\nhim to ask. After about an hour, Zhu\nYuan Jang finally finished his\ncommotion. I am now certain that what\nyou said is true. The outer world is\njust a dark, empty space. This thing can\nnot only see the moon, but also Mars,\njust not as clearly as the moon. After\nsaying that, Zhu Yuan Jang turned to\nlook at Juao. Bowerer, go take a look,\ntoo. I've already aimed the angle at the\nmoon. Only then did we Wu finally\nunderstand that Zhu Yuan Jang did not\nactually want to seize the astronomical\ntelescope. Rather, he wanted to confirm\nthat the thing was real. So after\nlearning how to operate it, he searched\nfor stars on his own. It's probably\nbecause the shock he received was too\noverwhelming and he didn't want Zu Bao\nto be affected before he was sure of the\ntruth. We was not surprised at all by\nthis. It's like someone suddenly telling\nhim that the flat earth theory is true\nand then presenting irrefutable\nevidence. The kind of impact was just as\nstrong for him as it was for Zhu Yuan\nJang at that moment. Now that Zhu Yuan\nJang no longer monopolized the telescope\nWu could finally have some romance with\nYusian. Little sweet Yusuan, come here.\nToday, young master will show you what\nthe moon looks like. Without waiting for\nZhu Yusuan&lt;unk&gt;s reply, he led his men\ndirectly to the telescope with 100x\nmagnification. While the other images\nhave higher magnification, to be honest,\nthe moon doesn't look very good. On the\ncontrary, the 100 times larger moon with\nits bigger and rounder shape is somewhat\nassociated with romance. Standing behind\nJuyu Schwan, I slowly adjusted the\ncamera while inhaling her faint\nfragrance. Zu Yuan didn't urge him, but\njust stood in front of Wei Wu with his\nhead down and didn't say anything.\nAlthough they weren't alone together,\nthe atmosphere still became ambiguous at\nthat moment. In particular, when we Wu\nturned the knob, he would always\naccidentally touch Zhu Yusuan's slender\nwaist. Seeing that the atmosphere was\njust right, Wayi Wu took a deep breath\nand prepared to move on to the next\nstep. Without going into too much\ndetail, at the very least, we should try\nto do the same thing as the Titanic's\nbow. However, just as Wei Wu was\npreparing to take action, Zhu Yuan\nJang&lt;unk&gt;s voice suddenly came from the\nside. Xiao Wu, since your telescope can\neven see the stars in the sky, can it\nalso be used on the battlefield? Upon\nhearing Zhu Yuan Jang&lt;unk&gt;s voice, Wei\nWu Gongs newly mustered courage vanished\ninstantly. He didn't dare say anything\noutwardly, but he was already furious\ninside. Damn it, you old man. How can\nyou be so clueless? Is this the time to\nbe talking about this? Didn't you see\nthat I'd already jumped over first base\nand was about to go straight to second\nbase? Why are you interrupting me now? I\ncurse you, old Jew. I curse that your\ndaughter will always be interrupted when\nshe's being intimate with her husband.\nOf course, even if he was furious\ninside, he was still the emperor and it\nhad to be given the respect he deserved.\nTurning back, we will put on a smile and\nsaid softly, \"Sure, look. This 200X\ntelescope can see people's faces clearly\nwithin 5 km. From a distance of 8 to 10\nkm, you can clearly see the military\ncamps and the movement of troops and\nsupplies. If we take a higher position\nor build a high platform, we should be\nable to see the army's movement clearly\nfrom 20 km away on the plane. Oh, I\nforgot to convert it. 1 km is equivalent\nto almost two lee, a traditional Chinese\nunit of distance. Now, after hearing\nWeii Wu&lt;unk&gt;s description, Zhu Yuan Jang\nimmediately sees the three astronomical\ntelescopes for himself. If it weren't\nfor Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s tantrum and his claim\nthat a multiplier of 600 was too high\nand unsuitable for use on the\nbattlefield, I'm afraid we won't even be\nable to save this last telescope. We've\neaten, we've drunk, we've asked what we\nneeded to ask, and we've taken what we\nneeded to take. Seeing that it was\ngetting late, old Zu finally left with\nZu Bao and the three astronomical\ntelescopes. However, Weii Wu was still\nvery careful and only after he was sure\nthey were completely far away did he\nclose the gate and find you. The\nfreeloader is finally gone. Sweetie,\nit's late. Come on, young master has\nsomething very special for you to eat.\nChapter 22. Eating crayfish while\nfighting the black myth with a young\ngirl playing along. Back in the\ncourtyard, Weii Wu summoned the four\ngirls who had been waiting for a long\ntime and were eating steamed buns to\nstave off hunger. They were made to\nclean up the mess on the table before\nthe fire was lit and the pot was set up\nagain. Once the pot is hot, immediately\nadd three packets of pre-cooked\ncrayfish. In an instant, a wonderfully\nfresh aroma wafted from the pot. The\nbright red crayfish are coated in a\nthick broth, and with each tumble in the\npot, they release an even richer aroma.\nFive girls stood to the side, completely\nunable to resist the aggressive\nolfactory impact of the crayfish aroma.\nAt that moment, they didn't even care\nabout the crayfish's somewhat terrifying\nappearance. Completely immersed in this\nintoxicating fragrance, while taking\nsmall bites of a steamed bun, he stared\nlongingly at the crayfish in the pot.\nswallowing them as he smelled their\naroma. Pre-cooked meals are already\ncooked and only need to be heated\nslightly before eating. Therefore, Weii\nWu simply stirfried it for a while, and\nwhen he felt it was almost cooked, he\ntook it off the heat. After placing the\nheated crayfish on the table, Wei Wu\nthen took out two more packets and\nhanded them to Ching Sha. These two\npackets are a reward for you, young\nmaster. Heat them up yourselves. Oh, and\ngive me your steamed buns. Eating only\ncrayfish is definitely not enough to\nfill you up, but dipping steamed buns in\nthe broth makes for an absolutely\ndelicious meal. Upon hearing we\nwoo&lt;unk&gt;s words, the four maids\nimmediately placed the steamed buns in\nfront of him. He then picked up two bags\nof crayfish and heated them up,\nfollowing Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s instructions.\nSeeing their eager expressions, Weii Wu\nsmiled and then looked at Yushi. Come\non, sweetie. Have some crayfish with the\nyoung master. After saying that, Wayiu\npicked up a shrimp and first sucked on\nthe broth. Then, starting from a waste,\nthe shell is broken off little by little\nto reveal the tender pink shrimp meat\ninside. Then, it dipped in a broth again\nbefore putting it in its mouth. With\neach bite, the rich fresh shrimp flavor\nexplodes in your mouth as you chew.\nAlthough it wasn't as bouncy as fresh\nshrimp, way wasn't that particular about\nit. After all, he hadn't eaten this for\nover a year. Crayfish weren't even\navailable when you travel back in time.\nA person's happiness can only be seen\nthrough comparison. While I could eat\ncrayfish before, I thought they were\njust soso. And I didn't really like\nthem. But when he arrived in the Ming\nDynasty, the feeling he got from this\nshrimp could only be described in four\nwords. Life is beautiful. After\nswallowing the shrimp meat in his mouth,\nWayi Wu was about to pick up the second\nshrimp. But then she noticed that Zhu\nYuan next to her hadn't started eating\nyet and asked curiously, \"What's wrong,\nYushwan? Don't you like this? Let me\ntell you, it may not look very\nappealing, but the taste is amazing.\"\nUpon hearing Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s words, Xuwan\nquickly offered an explanation. \"No,\nyoung master. I've never eaten with my\nhands before, and I don't know how to do\nit. I see. That's easy. Come on, young\nmaster will teach you.\" After saying\nthat, Wayi Wu grabbed Zhu Yuan&lt;unk&gt;s\nhand and pulled her to grab a shrimp\ntail. Then I taught her little by little\nhow to handle it. At first, Zhuan was a\nlittle hesitant, but she quickly got\nused to this way of eating. At the same\ntime, her sense of taste was also won\nover by the flavor of crayfish. But this\ngirl is interesting. She stopped eating\nafter only a few bites. Then she peeled\nout all the shrimp meat and put it away\nWoos mouth. While feeding him, she also\ntook out a handkerchief to wipe the oil\nstains from Wei Woos face and the\ncorners of his mouth. She looked exactly\nlike a devoted wife taking care of her\nhusband. Meanwhile, for maids who were\nalso eating crayfish, almost swallowed\nthe whole bowl. Because there weren't\nmany crayfish, the group finished eating\nthem quickly. Still not satisfied.\nSeeing Wayi Wu dipping steamed buns in\nthe soup, they set their sights on the\nkitchen. They used anything they could\nfind that was edible to dip in the\nbroth. Watching the four playful girls,\nWayi Wu suddenly felt less alone. Zhu\nYuan, who was wiping his stains with a\nhandkerchief, made him feel that it\nwould be better to stay in the Ming\nDynasty. Young master, why did you call\nme little sweetie just now? What does\nlittle sweetie mean? Weii Wu, who was\nlost in thought, was suddenly brought\nback to his senses by Zhu Yuswan&lt;unk&gt;s\nvoice. Little sweetie. Little sweetie\nmeans sweet and lovely, making you want\nto eat her up in one bite. Upon hearing\nWeii Wu&lt;unk&gt;s explanation, Xiushuan\nblushed deeply again, lowering her head\nshyly and not daring to speak. Seeing\nher like this, we wu stopped teasing her\nand stood up. Now that you've eaten and\ndrunk your fill, come on, all of you\ncome inside with me. Tonight, I'm going\nto have a 300 round battle. After Wei\nWoo finished speaking, he turned around\nand walked towards the house, leaving\nfive bewildered girls behind. Go inside.\nTonight we'll have a 300 round battle.\nYoung master, you wouldn't be thinking\nof. As we woo&lt;unk&gt;s maids, they were\nactually Wei Woos people long ago. No\nmatter what he wanted to do, these maids\nhad no right to resist and could only\nobey. Moreover, when they discovered\nthat their new owner was a young man,\nthey were actually prepared for the\nworst. Of the five, only Zhu Yushwan was\ndifferent from the others. Upon hearing\nWeii Wu&lt;unk&gt;s words, a hint of unease\nflashed in Zuyushuan's eyes. However,\nshe didn't say anything and followed the\nother girls into the house. However, it\nturned out that way Wu had not taken off\nhis clothes at all, but was instead\nfiddling with something he couldn't\nunderstand. Just as they were wondering\nwhat was going on, they saw the small\nscreen-like thing suddenly light up. And\nthere were some strange things moving on\nit. Ah, there's a monster. There's a\nmonster. Young master, there's a ghost.\nReeba is so scared. Run. Get the young\nmaster out of here. The four maids were\nterrified and shouted, but the situation\nbecame a complete mess. Zuyu Schwan was\nthe calmst, and it's unclear where she\ngot the courage, but she actually rushed\ndirectly to Weii Wu&lt;unk&gt;s side. He\npicked up Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s ashtray with one\nhand and grabbed Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s arm with\nthe other, trying to pull him away. Her\nactions clearly showed that she wanted\nto rescue Wei Wu. However, Wei Wu was\nterrified by her actions and managed to\nstop her from throwing the ashtray with\nall his might. Just kidding. He only has\nthis one screen. If Zhuan really smashes\nit, he'll have nowhere to cry. After\nfinally subduing Zhu Yuwan, Wayi Wu\nsuddenly took a deep breath and shouted,\n\"Quiet, everyone.\" In an instant, the\nentire room fell silent. \"What's all the\nfuss about? This is my precious little\ndarling. All of you come and sit down.\"\nThe maids had already witnessed Wei Woos\namazing abilities. So, when they heard\nthat it was his treasure, they\nimmediately calmed down. However, when\nthey arrived at Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s side, they\nall covered their faces, looking very\nshy. Only then did Wei Wu realize that\nwhat was beneath him was soft and\nfragrant. Looking down, he saw that Zhu\nYuwan was pinned down by him, her face\nflushed red. Seeing this, Wayi Wu no\nlonger hesitated, quickly relaxed his\nbody, and pressed down for a while\nbefore slowly getting up. Then, as if\nnothing had happened, he looked at the\nmaids as if nothing had occurred. Come\non, young master will teach you how to\nplay a game. A tense, exciting, and\nadrenaline pumping fighting game.\nChapter 23. Big head is gone and some\npeople's hearts are broken, too. Wayiwi\nWu then began preparations for the war.\nFirst, take out a bunch of grapes and\nhand them to Ching Shia, asking her to\nwash them and plate them. They took out\na few bags of sunflower seeds and potato\nchips and put two bottles of cola aside.\nHe took the ashtray back from Zuyu\nSchwan and put it away. Then prepared\ntwo packs of soft red Marlboro\ncigarettes and a lighter. Finally, and\nmost importantly, keep a double dose of\nquick acting heart-saving pills within\neasy reach. The battle has begun. On the\nscreen, the monkeykey's graceful\nmovements and gorgeous visuals were\ndisplayed. The five naive girls were\ninstantly stunned, their eyes glazed\nover and their faces blank. Immediately\nafterwards, Weii Wu was bombarded with\ntheir endless questions. Fortunately,\nWeii Wu was quite patient, and these\ngirls were also quite clever and\nquick-witted. From initial bewilderment\nto later being able to acknowledge the\nexistence of this amazing scene.\nMoreover, thanks to Wei Woos\nexplanation, they also gain some\nunderstanding of the game. He can\noccasionally utter a few words like\nhealth bar, monster, and skill. But as\ntime went by, the images on the screen\nwere always the same few. The running\ngame is intense. The battle is\nexhilarating. The screen gradually turns\nblack and a monkey offers incense. They\nwatched it repeatedly until the five\ngirls start to get sleepy. Zu Yushwan\nwas all right. She wasn't mainly\nwatching the screen, but rather peeling\ngrape skins and sunflower seedshells.\nThen he handed the peeled food to Wei\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s mouth and occasionally fed him\na little cola. Midway through, Wayi Wu\nnoticed that Zhu Yuan seemed interested,\nso he simply handed the controller over.\nI wanted to teach her how to play, but\nZu Yushuan shook her head and refused.\nThe other maids all knew that we wu\ndoted on Zhu Yusuan and that Zhu Yushuan\nstatus was different from theirs.\nThey're not even on the same level. So,\nI don't think it's wrong for them to\nexist. But as time went by, the novelty\nwore off. The girls are getting a little\nbored watching the same scene\nrepeatedly. When a screen lights up\nagain, the monkey with the iron rod\nwalks through the jungle and meets the\nbig-headed doll. The youngest member,\nDabba, finally couldn't help but ask a\nquestion. Young master, is this the only\nmonster in this game? Weii Wu&lt;unk&gt;s brow\ntwitched almost imperceptibly. Then he\nsaid calmly, \"No. Then why are you still\nfighting this monster, young master?\"\nUpon hearing this, Weii Wu fell silent.\nBut the sound of the controller button\nsuddenly became a little crisper. But\nthen Daba looked at him with an innocent\nexpression and continued to ask, \"Young\nmaster, are you unable to defeat this\nmonster?\" Nonsense, you little brat. How\ncould you talk such nonsense? Upon\nhearing this, Wayi Wu could no longer\nhold back, put down the handle, and\nstood up. Young master, I I just\nrecognize a hero and admire a hero. I\nI've been fighting this big-headed man\nfor dozens of days and nights. As an\nopponent, I respect his character and do\nnot wish to see him die by my hand. I do\nnot want to feel sentimental because of\nmy opponent's departure. Damn it. Don't\nunderestimate the bond between me and\nbig head. After speaking, Wayi Wu raised\nhis hand and pointed at Draaba with a\ntrembling hand. You little brat, how\ndare you talk about me like that? You'll\nbe punished. You absolutely must be\npunished. You won't get any good food\ntomorrow. As he spoke, Wayi Woo grabbed\nthe nitroglycerin pills, cigarettes, and\nlighter from the side of him. Young\nmaster has an upset stomach and is going\nto the outhouse. You can all do as you\nplease. After leaving a message, Wayi Wu\nquickly walked out of the house. After\ncoming out of the house, Wayi Wu put one\nhand to his forehead, tears welling up\nin his eyes. How could I, a dignified\nman of 8 ft tall, be so humiliated by a\nlittle old girl from 600 years ago? How\ncan I possibly save face? So what if I'm\nbad at the game? So what if I'm bad at\nthe game? Who hasn't been bad at the\ngame before? Is being bad a crime? The\nbitterness in his heart could not be\nexpressed to outsiders. With a\nmelancholy heart, Wayi Wu lit a\ncigarette to dispel his sorrow. On the\nother side, the innocent Doraba looked\nat the girls in the room with a puzzled\nexpression. Ladies, isn't there a\nchamber pot in the young master's room?\nWhy does he need to go outside to\nrelieve himself? The girls looked at\nDabba, then exchanged glances, their\neyes filled with helplessness. I don't\nknow whether to say she's brave or\ninnocent. If this had happened in the\nhome of any other high-ranking official,\nDaba would probably have been sent to\nthe woodshed and whipped. Now that we\nwoo has left, the girls are feeling\nbored sitting in the room. Bridget Lynn,\nLeah, Goler, and Draaba couldn't help\nbut start talking about the taste of\ncrayfish. Zhu Yushwan did not\nparticipate, but instead looked at the\nhandle that we woo had put down.\nActually, she was quite interested in\nthis game. She only served Wayi Woo\nbecause he was playing and she wanted to\nmake him happy. She sat next to Wayi Wu\nfor a long time and memorized how to\noperate the equipment. Now that Wayi Wu\nwas not around, she finally couldn't\nresist picking up the controller.\nOutside the room, Wayi Wu hid in the\ngarden and smoked three cigarettes\nbefore he could barely suppress the\nsorrow in his heart. It's just a\nbig-headed doll. I'm going to beat you\nto a pulp today. I won't sleep until\nI've killed you. As he spoke, Wayi Wu\nlifted his foot and walked towards the\ncourtyard, but stopped halfway there.\nHowever, playing games is a relatively\nprivate activity, and I can't relax if\nthere are people around. Or I could send\nthe servants to tell those girls to go\nback to sleep, and then I'll fight big\nhead to the death. No, no, those girls\naren't stupid. This is clearly telling\nthem that they can't accept defeat. I'm\na grown man. Yes, I'm the master. Anyone\nwho dares to laugh at the master, I'll\ndrag her into the house and beat her.\nThinking of his identity, Wayi Wu\ninstantly felt confident and stroed\ntowards the house. This time, he's going\nto really show off his prestige as the\nmaster. I strode forward to the door.\nBut before I even entered, I heard\ncheers and applause coming from inside.\nSister Yuswan, you're amazing. Sister\nYushwan, you haven't even learned how to\nplay. You just watch the young master\nplay for a bit and you already know how.\nNo wonder the young master dotes on you\nso much. Sister Yushwan, I wish I were\nas smart as you. But this is the young\nmaster's treasure. What if he sees it\nwhen he comes back? What the heck? What\ndid Yusuan do to make them admire her so\nmuch? Also, what do I see that's not\ngood? Filled with doubt, Wayi Wu strode\ninto the room. At this moment, the girls\nwere surrounding Zhu Yu Schwan, and no\none noticed that Weii Woo had already\nentered. It wasn't until Wei Wu came up\nbehind them that they finally understood\nwhat they were talking about. Zhu Yuwan\nwas seen holding a game controller in\nher delicate hand, staring intently at\nthe screen, not far away. The big-headed\ndoll that we Woo hated so much was no\nlonger on the screen. Instead, it was a\nburly, bald man with a string of\nBuddhist prayer beads tied around his\nneck and holding a long spear. Most\nimportantly, this bald, burly man is\nbeing brutally ravaged by monkeys. The\nhealth bar below was reduced to a mere\nsliver of health. At that moment, Wayi\nWu seemed to hear something very fragile\nshatter into pieces with a bang. Before\nhe could even display his authority as\nthe master, he fell to the ground. After\nquietly leaving the room, Wayi Wu lit\nanother cigarette and gaze at the starry\nsky at a 45° angle. The wind is so noisy\ntonight. Chapter 24, the Eastern Palace.\nZu Bao meets Lanu late at night. At the\nsame time, just as Wei Wu was lamenting\nthe impermanence of life, like a large\nintestine wrapped around a small\nintestine, inside the Funian Hall of the\nForbidden City, Zhu Yuan Jang and Zhu\nBao stood silently staring at the three\nastronomical telescopes in front of\nthem. After a long silence, Zhu Yuan\nJang spoke first. Bower, do you remember\nwhat we Wu said just now? Zu Yuan Jang\ndidn't even specify which of Wayi\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s words he had said. He simply\nasked a question casually, but Zhu Bao\nseemed to have a telepathic connection\nand immediately picked up on his\nfather's question. He spoke slowly, his\nvoice filled with longing to reach for\nthe moon in the heavens and capture\ndragons in the five oceans. Such bold\nwords truly inspire longing. Zhu Yuan\nJang felt the same way, but he was more\nconcerned about something else. This\nthing is no thicker than an arm. You can\npeer into the outer world and observe\nthe sun, moon, and stars. Technology.\nTechnology. Father, do you want the Ming\ndynasty to start developing technology\nas well? If it's possible 600 years from\nnow, why can't our great Ming dynasty?\nBesides, didn't heaven send Xiao Xiao\nhere? Upon hearing Zhu Yuan Jang mention\nWei Wu, Zhu Bao was filled with emotion.\nThis was their first meeting, but he\nfelt an unprecedented shock from Wei\nWoo. Divine abilities to manipulate\nobject from the void, celestial crops to\nalleviate famine, and wondrous tools for\npeering into the heavens. There's also a\nrenewed understanding of the world. Any\none of these insights could be\nastonishing. However, he accepted these\nthings in just a few hours, which would\nhave shaken anyone's emotions. Just as\nZu Bao was sighing, Zu Yuan Jan spoke\nagain. This kid is lazy and doesn't want\nto be an official and we don't want to\nforce him, but we must develop science\nand technology. Bower, what do you\nthink? Zhu Bao pondered for a moment\nupon hearing this and then smiled.\nFather, he is unwilling to serve as an\nofficial simply because he does not want\nto get involved in court disputes. In\nthat case, we should just keep him out\nof it. Before Zhu Yuan Jang could speak,\nZhu Bao continued, however, I believe\nthat we should ask Wayi Wu directly\nabout this matter. Perhaps he can\nsuggest a better solution. Leave this\nmatter to your son. Father is, after\nall, the emperor, and he may have\nreservations if you speak up. Zhu Yuan\nJang nodded thoughtfully, then readily\nagreed. All right, I'll leave that kid\nWu to you. After finalizing the\nquestions regarding Wei Wu, Crown Prince\nZhu Bao returned directly to the Eastern\nPalace. Upon returning to his palace,\nZhu Bao did not go directly to his room\nto rest, but instead went to his study.\nLeen,\nthis servant is here. As soon as Zhu Bao\nfinished speaking, a person dressed as a\nunic slowly emerged from the darkness.\nHis appearance was silent, as if he had\nbeen lurking in the shadows all along. I\nwish to see the secret master Lu. Yes.\nWith a response, Leaf Fong bowed and\nretreated, slowly disappearing into the\ndarkness. Not long after, Lan Yu, the\nmost reckless man in the Ming dynasty,\nwas brought before Zu Bao. Your subject,\nLan Yu, greets Your Highness, the Crown\nPrince. Lan Yu first greeted Zu Bao\nrespectfully and then spoke. Your\nhighness, if you want to see me, just\nask someone to announce your arrival.\nCould you please not ask that castrated\nman who has no testicles? He came to my\nroom in the middle of the night and woke\nme up at the bedside. When I opened my\neyes, I saw that pale face. I almost\nstabbed him with a knife. Hearing Lan\nYu&lt;unk&gt;s complaints, Zhu Bao just\nsmiled. All right, Leong is acting on my\norders. The reason I summoned you here\nis that I don't want anyone else to\nknow. Although Lan Yu was reckless, he\nwas not stupid. Otherwise, he could not\nhave thrived in the army. Upon hearing\nZhu Bao&lt;unk&gt;s words, he immediately\nunderstood how important the matter at\nhand was. Just then, Zhu Bao spoke\nagain. Uncle, I have a matter I would\nlike to ask you to handle, but this\nmatter will leave me with a bad\nreputation for all time. Although Lan Yu\nis reckless, he can be considered the\nnumber one diehard princling. Now that\nthe crown prince has spoken, the weight\nof that uncle is more powerful than\nanything else. Therefore, after Zhu Bao\nfinished speaking, Lan Yu gave his\nanswer directly. Your highness, whatever\nyou need to do, just leave it to me. Lan\nYu, I don't care about any reputation or\nanything like that. Upon hearing this,\nZhua nodded in satisfaction before\nspeaking. Now that the war in the\nsouthwest is going well and the army has\nreturned to the capital, there are no\nmore worries. Father Emperor is willing\nto send troops to fight the Japanese\npirates. Japanese pirates? that tiny\nisolated country that once killed our\nMink Dynasty envoy. Lonnie was taken\naback when she heard this, not expecting\nthe crown prince to bring up this small\nplace. That's right. And the reason I\nneed my uncle's help is also related to\nthis insignificant little country. Your\nhighness, please speak. Lu bowed in\nresponse, but then saw a chilling\nmurderous intent flash in Juba&lt;unk&gt;s\neyes. When we attack the Japanese\npirates in the future, I will suggest to\nmy father that my uncle be the\ncommander-in-chief. It will be my\nuncle's job to do it. Bachi's massacre\nof 400,000 Jiao soldiers has been\ncondemned for a thousand years. But now\nI, the empress, want my uncle to\nslaughter the entire nation of Japanese\npirates. This is an act that will be\nremembered with infamy for eternity. So\nI will not force you. If you are\nunwilling, uncle, you may pretend that\nwe have never met today, as if to avoid\nputting pressure on Lan Yu. Zhu Bao\ndidn't even look at Lan Yu after he\nfinished speaking. His eyes gazed at the\nsky through the window. His gaze so deep\nit seemed he could see right through the\nheavens. However, Lu did not hesitate at\nall and immediately stood up after Zhu\nBao finished speaking. Your Highness,\nalthough Lord Wuin is criticized, he has\nalso earned a formidable reputation.\nAfter saying that, Lu knelt down\ndirectly in front of Zuao. Lan Yu\nreceived the imperial decree. Upon\nhearing Lan Yu&lt;unk&gt;s response, Zhuao\nsmiled with satisfaction and then helped\nLanu up. After the two were seated\nagain, Lan Yu finally spoke up and asked\na question. Your highness, I don't quite\nunderstand why your majesty would send\ntroops to fight the Japanese pirates.\nThey are just a tiny, insignificant\ncountry. You mean to say that doing this\nis not only a waste of manpower and\nresources, but also a losing\nproposition, right? Lu not I'm not\nafraid of killing Lu, but the Japanese\npirates are poor and the civil officials\nwill surely cause trouble. Your\nhighness, I would advise his majesty to\nthink twice. What if I told you that the\nland of the Japanese pirates not only is\ngold mines, but also an inexhaustible\nmountain of silver? Whoosh! No sooner\nhad crowned Prince Zu Bao finished\nspeaking than Lan Yu suddenly stood up,\nmoving so fast that he seemed to be\nmaking a whistling sound. Then Lan\nYu&lt;unk&gt;s powerful and resolute voice\nrang out. Your highness, I believe you\nneed not reconsider. That small island\nin the East China Sea has been an\nintegral part of China's territory since\nancient times. Now, however, this land\nhas been seized by thieves. Our great\nMing is the legitimate dynasty of the\nworld and it is only right and proper to\nrecover this homeland. Those Japanese\npirates have occupied our Ming territory\nfor so long. They are already courting\ndeath. Let them destroy our country,\nwipe out our people, and exterminate our\nrace. Zu Bao hadn't expected Lan\nYu&lt;unk&gt;s attitude to change so quickly\nand to speak with such righteous\nindignation. But then I thought about it\nagain and even a brute like Lu reacted\nthis way. Those civil officials and\nministers will probably change their\nminds even faster than Lanu when they\nhear this news. Just as Zu Bao was\nchuckling to himself, he suddenly heard\nLan Yu&lt;unk&gt;s voice asking a question.\nBut your highness, if there really are\ngold and silver mines in the land of the\nJapanese pirates, why have we never\nheard of them before? Zuao looked at Lan\nYu, smiled slightly, and then said,\n\"What I am about to say is known to\nfewer than five people in the entire\nMing dynasty.\" Uncle, listen carefully\nand remember it. Chapter 25. Zhu Bao's\nscheme. Lu's nighttime break-in at Wei\nMansion. Zhu Bao stood up, pushed open\nthe study door, and slowly walked out of\nthe study. Lan Yu immediately perked up\nand followed Zu Bao intently. My father\nand I recently met an extraordinary\nperson. It wouldn't be an exaggeration\nto say that he can know a thousand years\ninto the past and 600 years into the\nfuture. Upon hearing this, Lanu, who was\nfollowing behind, immediately thought of\nsomething. He had recently heard rumors\nthat the former prime minister who\nWeong's residence had been bestowed upon\nhim by his majesty. No one knew who the\nreward was given to, but it seems it was\nthis so-called extraordinary person.\nHowever, after Zhu Bao finished\nspeaking, Lan Yu frowned inwardly. His\nfirst thought was that his majesty and\nhis highness, the crown prince, had\nencountered a charlatan. There's no such\nthing as knowing a thousand years into\nthe past or 600 years into the future.\nClearly, they've been deceived. Just as\nhe was about to ask, he heard the crown\nprince's voice again. From him, my\nfather and I gain a new understanding of\nthe world and learn a lot of things. As\nthey spoke, the two arrived at the\ngarden and sat down in the garden\npavilion. Zhuao did not hide anything\nfrom Lanu and recounted Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s\nexistence and the things he had said. Of\ncourse, Zhu Bao concealed Weii Wu&lt;unk&gt;s\norigins and his miraculous methods. He\nsimply mentioned some possible events\nand what we wu had brought out. However,\nafter Zu Bao finished speaking, he\nnoticed that Lan Yu&lt;unk&gt;s expression was\nsomewhat strange. Before he could\ncontinue speaking, he heard Lan Yu&lt;unk&gt;s\nvoice full of doubt. Your highness, I am\nbut a rough man. I do not understand\nthose calculations of the past and\nfuture. But at this point, Lanu\nhesitated for a moment, but then\ncontinued through gritted teeth. The\nclimate of this world is inherently\nunpredictable. Is it really related to\nthe little ice age that person\nmentioned? He himself couldn't explain\nit. And as for that potato, how can it\nbe proven to be a superior variety when\nit hasn't even been produced yet? Zuao\nwas at a loss for words when faced with\nLanu's question. After all, he had seen\nmany things with his own eyes, but he\ncouldn't explain them to Lanu. He\ndeliberately concealed Weii Wu's ability\nto manipulate objects from thin air,\nwhich was actually a form of protection.\nIf people knew about his miraculous\nabilities, many would probably secretly\ntry to take advantage of him. So, after\nLanu finished speaking, Zhu Bao simply\nresponded with one sentence. I cannot go\ninto details about this matter with you,\nbut my father and I have both witnessed\nthe stranges firsthand. Upon hearing\nthis, Lu nodded slowly, but said nothing\nmore. Seeing that it was getting late,\nZhu Bao gave Lan Yu a few more\ninstructions and then let him leave. The\nreason Zhu Bao entrusted this matter to\nLan Yu was primarily because Lan Yu is\nloyal enough. Secondly, Lan Yu is\nimpulsive, so entrusting him with\nsomething as simple as slaughtering a\ncountry wouldn't seem too abrupt.\nFurthermore, even though the Ming\ndynasty had only been established for a\nshort time, there was already a trend of\ncivil and military officials vying for\npower. In particular, the Houi Yong case\ninvolved a wide range of people which\nweakened the civil officials while\nboosting the arrogance of the military\ngenerals and nobles. By using the\nmassacre of Japanese pirates, military\nofficers and nobles were given an\nopportunity to tarnish their own\nreputations, which could be seen as a\nmeans of balancing the interests of both\nthe civil and military factions,\nespecially Lu, whose loyalty is beyond\nquestion. But in recent years, it has\nindeed gotten a bit arrogant. So doing\nthis can be seen as a form of\nprotection. This move would both\npreserve his father's reputation and\nbalance the civil and military factions.\nWhen the incident comes to light, Zhu\nYuan Jang, as the emperor, will surely\nhold them accountable, and Zua will then\nstep forward to plead for them. In the\nend, things were settled. Zhu Yuan\nJang&lt;unk&gt;s reputation was preserved. The\ncivil and military officials were\nbalanced and the military generals and\nnobles were also protected. It also\ndemonstrates his magnanimity and\nbenevolence as the crown prince of the\nMing dynasty. Achieving multiple\nbenefits in one fell swoop. Zhuao&lt;unk&gt;s\nability to become the most stable crown\nprince in history was due not only to\nZhu Yuan Jang&lt;unk&gt;s favor, but also to\nhis own undeniable competence. On the\nother side, Lan Yu's face immediately\ndarkened after leaving the East Palace.\nHe couldn't help but curse inwardly\nwhenever he thought of that so-called\nextraordinary person. How despicable.\nThis fraudster has actually misled his\nmajesty and the crown prince and even\ndared to falsely claim that our great\nMing dynasty is doomed. His heart is\nutterly despicable. You just wait. I\nwill expose your true colors and skin\nyou alive. You bastard who spreads\nheresy. Having made up her mind, Lan Yu\nimmediately quickened her pace. After\nleaving the palace, he did not return to\nhis own residence, but went straight to\nWei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s residence. Although Zhu\nYuan Jang deployed a lot of people\naround this mansion. But Lan Yu was,\nafter all, a general who had fought on\nthe battlefield for many years, and his\nskills and alertness far surpassed those\nof ordinary people. After avoiding the\nimperial guards surrounding the mansion,\nhe simply flipped over the courtyard\nwall and entered the mansion. His\nrelationship with Hu Wei Yong wasn't\ngood, but he still visited this mansion\nand easily found the principal wife. He\noriginally thought Weii Wu was already\nasleep and planned to secretly tie him\nup and take him back for interrogation.\nBefore even stepping into the courtyard,\nthey heard several sounds of laughter\nand playful banter. Upon entering the\ncourtyard, they found that the main\nhouse was still lit up and the door was\nwide open. Several maids were\nsurrounding a young man talking about\nsomething, but they were laughing very\nhappily. Although Zuyuan was a princess,\nshe never married and lived in the\npalace. Although Lan Yu was a third rank\nofficial in the Grand General's office,\nhe had only been to the Fian Hall and\nthe Crown Prince's Eastern Palace. He\ndidn't know who Xu Yuan was at all.\nOtherwise, seeing the princess there, he\ncertainly wouldn't have dared to act\nrecklessly. Therefore, upon seeing the\nsituation in the room, Lanu had only one\nthought in her mind. This so-called\nextraordinary person is not only a\nfraud, but also a lecture. Seeing the\ncurrent situation, Lanu understood that\nit was no longer possible to secretly\ntake the person away. He simply walked\ninto the courtyard openly and stood\nconfidently outside the main house. A\nminute passed and Lonnie was still\nstanding outside the door unnoticed by\nanyone. The reason is simple. After\nexperiencing the double blow of Big\nHead's murder and the death of Black\nWind King, Weii Woo, citing the reason\nthat playing games alone was not fun,\ndecisively turned off his PS5 and then\ntook out a deck of cards. Under his\npatient guidance, the six of them\nstarted playing a game of drawing the\nking around the table. The girls had\nnever played cards before and their\ncuriosity led them to play with complete\nenthusiasm. Meanwhile, Wayiu was\nsurrounded by five beautiful young girls\nplaying games. So, who would bother to\nlook outside the door? And so, this\nscene unfolded with the person inside\nplaying with the blue jade standing\noutside the door. Seeing that none of\nthe people were looking towards the\ndoor, Lana frowned. Cough. No one\nnoticed. Cough, cough. Inside, they were\nstill having a great time playing.\nLonnie was furious. He took a deep\nbreath and then coughed a few times.\nCough, cough, cough. Hearing the\npowerful cough, the man and five women\nfinally realized something was wrong.\nUpon seeing a stranger standing at the\nouter gate, Wayi Wu immediately became\nvigilant. When they moved into the\nmansion during the day, Wayiu had seen\nall the servants in the household. While\nI might not be able to recognize\neveryone, I'm certain that this burly\nman in front of me is definitely not one\nof them since he's an uninvited guest,\nthere's no need to be polite to him. His\nconsciousness locked onto the pistol in\nthe systems inventory. And he stood up\nlooking at Lanu and demanding, \"Who the\nhell do you think you are?\" barging into\nsomeone's house in the middle of the\nnight. Chapter 26. I, Wayi Wu, the\nnumber one stick king of the Ming\nDynasty. Wiiu deliberately raised his\nvoice when he spoke. They tried to make\nsure the servants inside the mansion and\nthe guards outside could hear them. And\nin fact, the people outside did hear\nthem. So, not long after we woo shouted,\na jumble of footsteps could be heard\noutside the courtyard. But this guy in\nfront of me, even though he heard the\nnoise, still stood there motionless.\nWeii Wu found this confident attitude\nsomewhat strange. Just as he was\nwondering what was going on, someone\nrushed in from outside the courtyard.\nThe first to enter the courtyard were\nShan Llin and Jean Hai, who had\npreviously eaten instant noodles with\nWei Wu. Then came the other guards and\nthe servants from the household. Upon\nseeing people in the courtyard, Shan\nLlin and Jean Hai drew their swords\nwithout saying a word and led their men\nto rush over. However, just as they\napproached, Shan Llin, who was leading\nthe way, suddenly exclaimed in surprise,\n\"Mark Yong Chong! Marque of Yong Chong?\"\nWeii Wu was stunned when he heard this\ntitle. Isn't this Lan Yu's title? This\nguy in front of me is Lan Yu. Upon\ndiscovering that the person in the\ncourtyard was Lan Yu, Shan Lin and the\nother guards immediately stopped what\nthey were doing. To be honest, they were\nalso very curious and couldn't\nunderstand why Mari Yong Chong Lan Yu\nwould be here. But these people did not\nlet their guard down and all stood in\nfront of Wei Wu. There's no way they can\nwin in a fight. Lan Yu's marshall\nprowess was earned through battle. But\nShinllin was confident that he could get\nrid of Wei Woo before everyone else\nfell. Anyway, someone has already been\nsent to the palace to report. So, we\njust need to stall for a while. However,\nto Shunlin's surprise, Weii Wu stepped\nout from the crowd at this crucial\nmoment. So, it's the marquee of Yong\nShan. I didn't expect the marquee to\nhave such peculiar interests. He likes\nto stay up late at night and go to other\npeople's houses to stand guard. To be\nhonest, Wayiu didn't have any ill\nfeelings towards Lan Yu, but he\ncertainly didn't like him either.\nHistorically, the last of the four major\ncases during the Hong Wu reign was the\nLan Yu case. Although Zhu Yuan\nJang&lt;unk&gt;s reasons for killing him were\nsomewhat far-fetched, Lanu could not\npossibly have committed treason. But\nthat doesn't mean he shouldn't have died\nor that the things he did deserve to\ndie. He was arrogant and complacent,\nallowed his troops to destroy passes,\nkept many slaves and adopted sons,\nlevied exorbitant taxes, seized fertile\nland, and drove away and beat the\nimperial sensors. To be fair, Lu was\nindeed brave on the battlefield, and\nmade many great contributions.\nOtherwise, he wouldn't have been able to\nobtain the title of Duke based solely on\nhis military achievements after the\nfounding of the Ming dynasty. It should\nbe noted that the dukes of the early\nMing dynasty were basically awarded\nbased on their merits in establishing\nthe dynasty. Therefore, Wayiu neither\nliked nor disliked Lu. They won't\nactively seek out friends, but they also\nwon't deliberately make enemies by being\ncold to them. But now, this guy actually\nsneaked into my house in the middle of\nthe night, and I can't tolerate that.\nFortunately, today I only play cards\nwith the maids. What if I had played\npoker with Zuyuan? This is why we wu\nimmediately started mocking her when he\nopened his mouth on Lan Yu's side upon\nhearing Wu&lt;unk&gt;s taunts. His temper\nflared up immediately. You treacherous\nand cunning scoundrel. How dare you use\ntrickery to deceive his majesty and his\nhighness the crown prince. Today I lu\nhere to expose you. And while I'm at it,\nI'll break your bones and take them back\nto feed my guard dog. Exposing me? using\ncharlatanry to deceive the emperor.\nBewitching the emperor and the crown\nprince. Where did this idiot hear these\nrumors from, etc. Only a handful of\npeople in the entire Ming dynasty know\nof my existence. Yusen could be ruled\nout. Emperor's Ma wouldn't say these\nthings to Lan Yu, a military general.\nSo, it could only be old Zu and Little\nZu. Lan Yu has always been a staunch\nsupporter of the princlings. Without a\ndoubt, he must have heard something from\nShiau. However, Shiao would never speak\nill of himself. So, there's only one\npossibility. This reckless fool in front\nof me with only a superficial\nunderstanding, imagined some things and\nthen took them as truth. Thinking of\nthis, Wayi Wu couldn't help but feel a\nheadache coming on. Taking down Lanu\nisn't difficult. No matter how powerful\nhe is, he'll have to kneel down and sing\nconquer when faced with a pistol. Given\nthe current situation, it's clear that\nwe can't just kill them outright. The\nkey issue is that the people around him\nare no match for Lan Yu, which is a bit\ntroublesome. After thinking about it,\nthe only solution was to stall for time.\nThe fact that Shin Lin and his group\nwere alerted meant that old Zu would\nsoon find out what was happening here.\nAs long as either Lo or Xiao Zu comes,\nLanu won't dare to cause trouble here.\nThinking of this, Wayi Wu looked\ndirectly at Lan Yu and said, \"Lan Yu, is\nit? I've heard that you are\nexceptionally brave and skilled in\nmartial arts and can be considered the\nmost powerful general in our Ming\ndynasty, second only to the veteran\ngenerals. Since you are a fierce\ngeneral, you must be very skilled in\nmartial arts. I consider myself to be\nthe number one stick master of the Ming\ndynasty, and I am equally unparalleled\nin martial arts. I have no idea why you\nwould want to slander my innocence\nwithout cause. Nor do I care what your\npurpose is in breaking into my residence\ntonight. If you can withstand one of my\nblows without falling, I way Woo will\nbind my hands and be at your mercy. If\nyou can't, you'll kneel down and\napologize to me. Don't worry, I won't\nuse an iron rod, nor will I strike your\nhead, heart, or groin. Those vital\npoints. Fierce General, do you dare to\ncompare with me? Upon hearing this, Lanu\nlooked at Wayi Wu with suspicion.\nAlthough he didn't know what tricks Wei\nWu was up to, his purpose in coming was\nto expose Wei Woo. Moreover, given Wei\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s small physique, even if he were\nwielding an iron rod, he wouldn't be\nworried as long as it wasn't used to\nattack vital points. Furthermore, as a\nmilitary general, how could he tolerate\nsuch provocation? So after Wei Wu\nfinished speaking, he immediately took\ntwo steps forward. It's just one blow.\nWhat's wrong with that? I, Lu, will\nstand right here and let you hit me.\nDon't even mention falling down. If I\nsway even slightly or let out a single\ncry of pain, I'll consider myself a\nloser. And I, you will kneel down and\ncall you grandpa. But if I win, you'd\nbetter confess all your tricks honestly.\nOtherwise, I'm not one of those delicate\ncivil officials. I have plenty of\nstrength and methods. Holy crap. Did the\nscorpion demon wander onto the wrong\nset? After Lanu finished speaking, Wayi\nWu immediately burst in a laughter. Then\nWayi Wu reached into his waistband and\npulled it out suddenly. A short stick\nabout 40 cm long and black in appearance\nappeared in his hand. Upon closer\ninspection, there are two protruding\nmetal parts at the top of the short\nstick. Good heavens, this is a high\nvoltage stun gun. Looking at the stun\ngun in his hand, Weii Wu smiled slightly\nand then tossed it to Lanu. Since you\ncall me a fraud, let me examine you\nfirst. This is my signature weapon, the\nThunder Cudgel. Lanu took the stun gun\nand fiddled with it in her hand for a\nwhile. Although it had some strange\ndecorations, it also felt a bit odd.\nHowever, apart from being a bit heavier\nthan a wooden stick, no other problems\nwere found. After confirming that there\nwas nothing wrong with the stick, Lan Yu\ntossed it back to Wei Wu. After\nretrieving the stun gun, Weii Wu calmly\nturned off the safety and then\napproached Lan Yu. Marquon Chong, are\nyou ready? This next blow of mine is\ngoing to hurt a lot. You might even wet\nyour pants. Chapter 27. Wayi Woo. Young\nmaster, I have other sticks, even more\npowerful ones. Snort. Lanu snorted\ncoldly and didn't say anything, but she\nalso assumed a defensive stance. Seeing\nthis, we wu couldn't help but ask\nanother question. Lord Yong Chong, did\nyou drink a lot of water tonight? If you\nreally urinate in pain, your reputation\nwill be ruined. Enough talk. Stop\nwasting time. Let's get started. Okay,\nhere I come. After saying that, Wayiu\ndirectly stabbed the high voltage\nelectrobat at Lan Yu. The instant the\nstun gun made contact with Lonu's body,\nWeii Wu decisively pressed the switch.\nClap clap clap clap clap. As blue\nlightning flashed, a series of rapid\ncrackling sounds also rang out in the\nair. Under normal circumstances, when a\nperson is shocked by an electric shock,\nthey will instinctively bounce away from\nthe danger. Someone like Lawn, you would\ninstinctively recoil from physical\ncontact. However, Wayi Wu thrust his\nstaff with such force that Lan Yu's body\nhad no room to bounce away. As the\nelectric current surged through her,\nLanu felt a sharp pain coming from the\nspot where she had been stabbed. Then, a\ntingling sensation spread through my\nbody and all the muscles in my body\ntensed up uncontrollably. At the same\ntime, it felt as if millions of ants\nwere crawling and biting inside my body.\nIn that instant, Lanu's consciousness\nseemed to begin to dissipate. Not only\nwere his eyes lifeless, but his whole\nbody was trembling uncontrollably as if\nhis body no longer belonged to him. 1\nsecond, 2 seconds, 3 seconds. A normal\nperson would lose their resistance or\neven faint after being attacked with a\nstun gun in about 1 to 2 seconds. But\nLanu lived up to his name, managing to\nhold on for 5 seconds before collapsing\nunconscious. to be able to withstand the\ndivine power of my thunderclap staff for\nso long. Your strength is quite\nimpressive. After saying that, we wuge\npretended to blow on the tip of the stun\ngun and then glanced at Lanu's pants.\nNot bad. At least this guy saved face\nand didn't wet his pan from the electric\nshock. Otherwise, if word got out, Lon,\nyou would lose face in the aristocratic\ncircles. Shinlang Hai, find a rope and\ntie him up for me. Tie him up tightly.\nThis guy is no pushover. In fact, even\nwithout Wei Woo saying so, someone had\nalready gone to get the rope. Moreover,\nbecause the person to be tied up was\nLanu, the hemp rope was soaked in water\nfirst. Subsequently, the unconscious\nLanu was tied up like a dumpling and\nleft in a corner. After winning over\nLanu, they dealt with both the guards\nand the servants in Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s\nhousehold. His eyes were filled with\ndisbelief and deep shock. Despite his\nseemingly frail physique, he displayed\nextraordinary power, even defeating\nMarquei Yong Chong. Lan Yu, the maid\nsurrounded Weii Wu, their eyes filled\nwith admiration as they looked at him.\nZhuan looked at Wayi Wu with dazzled\neyes and praised him. Young master, your\nthunder cudgel is really amazing. That's\nright. What's so special about the\nThunderCudel? I have something even more\npowerful. I'll show you some of those\nwhen I have a chance. Upon hearing this,\nZhuwan became even more curious. Young\nmaster, what kind of stick is even more\npowerful? Uru Rugan. That's right,\nRugun. A flexible stick can make a\ncracking sound like a thunderbolt stick.\nIt can make a sound, but the frequency\nmight not be as fast. Although the sound\nis louder. Zu Yushwan didn't understand\nwhat frequency meant, but she could\nunderstand that the sound was louder.\nHowever, just as he was about to ask\nfurther questions, Wayiu had already\nleft and come to Lan Yu&lt;unk&gt;s side. It\nwasn't that he was shy. It was mainly\nthat if they continued talking, he was\nafraid he wouldn't be able to resist\nthinking about Shiin Shien. Arriving at\nthe corner, they looked at Lan Yu, who\nwas showing signs of waking up. Weii Wu\ncouldn't help but sigh inwardly. No\nwonder Lu had been able to achieve merit\non the battlefield so many times. It\ntakes at least 8 to 10 minutes for a\nnormal person to recover naturally after\nbeing knocked unconscious by an electric\nshock. This guy can endure longer than\nthe average person, but his recovery\ntime is much faster. Just as Wei Wu was\nsighing, Wanu opened his eyes. Seeing\nthe gloomy and uncertain expression on\nthe other person's face, we wu revealed\na bright smile. How about it, Marquon\nChong? My thunder cudgel is quite\npowerful, isn't it? In truth, Wanu was\nnot convinced. Although he lost, he\nbelieved there was something wrong with\nthe situation. Weii Wu&lt;unk&gt;s technique\nwasn't some kind of stick\nfighting. There must have been a\nmechanism on the stick. The problem is\nthat we woo had inspected the stick for\nhim beforehand, but he himself couldn't\nfind the problem. The reasoning behind\nbringing this up now is completely\nuntenable. Seeing that Lu remained\nsilent, we woo smiled, but did not\nprovoke him further. As for the\npreviously agreed upon rule that the\nloser would kneel down and call him\ngrandpa. Wayi Wu didn't even consider\nthat possibility. Who is Lan Yu? He is\nthe crown prince's uncle. Even Zu Yuan J\nwould be furious if he were asked to\nkneel down and call him grandpa.\nBesides, we'll be seeing each other all\nthe time, so there's no need to kick\nsomeone when they're down. Now, all we\nneed to do is wait for Lao Zhu or Xiao\nto come and take the person away, and\nthere won't be any other trouble.\nSometimes it really is true that you can\njust speak of the devil and he appears.\nJust as Wei Wu was thinking about\nwaiting for someone to arrive, a dense\nhurried sound of footsteps came from\noutside the courtyard. Then a large\ngroup of people surrounded Zhu Yuan Jang\nand Zhu Bao as they rushed into the\ncourtyard. Seeing Wei Wu standing there\nunharmed, Old Zu visibly relaxed. But\nwhat followed was a fit of rage, his\nmurderous gaze fixed on Lan Yu, who was\ntied to the corner of the wall. Without\nthe slightest hesitation, Zhu Yuan Jang\nacted entirely on instinct. As expected\nof an emperor on horseback, even though\nhe's over 50 and a bit overweight, his\nmovements are incredibly swift. He\nstepped forward and kicked Lanu in the\nface. The force was so great that Lan\nYu's head made intimate contact with the\nwall. After kicking him, he didn't even\nbother to ask any questions and\nimmediately started giving orders.\nGuards, throw lanu into the death row.\nNo one is to see him without my order.\nAt this moment, even Zhu Yuan Jang\nchanged his self- reference, issuing\norders directly as an emperor. But that\nwasn't the end of it. After dealing with\nLan Yu, Zhu Yuan Jang turned his\nattention to Shan Lin and the others.\nYou failed in your duty of protection,\nallowing someone to infiltrate Weii\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s residence. You shall also be\nthrown into the death. Row to await your\nfate. As soon as he finished speaking, a\nlarge number of guards rushed out from\nbehind, Zhu Yuan Jang and arrested Lan\nYu and Shinl. Seeing Shan Lin and the\nothers pale and desperate faces, Wayi Wu\nthought for a moment, but still chose\nnot to speak. Zhu Yuan Jang was furious\nand there were so many guards and\nservants around him. At this point,\npleading for mercy would put Zhu Yuan\nJang in an awkward position. After all,\nthe emperor's words are law when he is\nangry. It would be too frivolous to\nissue an order one second and then\nretract at the next. Moreover, Zhu Yuan\nJang said that he would be thrown into a\ndeath row cell to await his fate, which\nmeant that he would be safe for the time\nbeing. If he waits until everyone else\nhas left before speaking up, Zhu Yuan\nJang will most likely give him that\nface. As for Lan Yu, well, that guy\nwon't die. As long as Zu Bao is alive,\nhe won't die. However, just as Lan Yu\nwas about to be taken away, Zhu Yuan\nJang spoke up again. Shiao Wu, since you\nare the agrieved party in this matter,\nwe will hand over the power to deal with\nLan Yu to you. Lu had already been\nhelped away from the courtyard. Wayi Wu\nunderstood the meaning behind Zhu Yuan\nJang&lt;unk&gt;s words and was immediately at\na loss for words. Chapter 28, history\ncontinues. Zhu Xianging is seriously\nill. Old Zu was clearly giving himself a\nchance to benevolent to Lan Yu. Who was\nLan Yu? He was a minister whom Zhu Yuan\nJang had specially reserved for Zhu Bao\nto assist him. It can be said that as\nlong as Lan Yu does not commit an\nunforgivable crime, he will at most be\npunished but not sentenced to death. As\nsomeone from 600 years in the future and\nwith such a deep understanding of the\nMing dynasty, it's impossible that I\ndidn't know about this. Old Jew took\naction as soon as he entered the room\nand then ordered Lan Yu to be thrown\ninto the death row which was to express\na certain attitude. It was not only for\nLanu to see but also for himself and\nwhat he was expressing was his emphasis\non it. Then just before Lu was about to\nbe taken away, he deliberately said that\nhe would give him the right to dispose\nof her. Lu will definitely not die. At\nmost, he will suffer some physical pain,\nand even after he gets out of death row,\nhe will still remember my favor. Of\ncourse, this is also a test to see if I\ncan understand the meaning. This is why\nWei Wu was both amused and exasperated.\nWhether one is a smart person or a fool\nwill determine how old Ju will treat\nthem in the future. As it turned out,\nWei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s guess was indeed correct.\nWhen Zhu Yuan Jang saw the look of\namusement and exasperation on his face,\nhe immediately smiled. Zu Bao, who had\nbeen silent until now, suddenly spoke up\nand gave an order. Everyone get out. No\none is allowed to enter the compound\nwithout orders. Once everyone had left\nthe courtyard, and only the three of\nthem remained, Zhu Bao spoke again.\nShiao Wu Lu was indeed too reckless in\nthis matter, but it's also my fault for\nnot explaining things clearly to him.\nUpon hearing this, Wayiu was about to\nsay something when Zhu Bao spoke first.\nI was going to hand over the matter of\nthe Japanese pirates to him. So, I took\nthe opportunity to mention some things\nabout you. Upon hearing this, Wayi Woos\neyes lit up. Exactly. Handing over a\nmassacre like this to Lan Yu is\nabsolutely perfect. He's just the right\nperson for it. Of course, it would be\neven better if we could bring Chin King\nXhuan along, as that guy is truly\nruthless and cruel. Unfortunately, this\nidea can only remain a thought. Neither\nZhu Yuan Jang nor Zu Yuan Jang would\nagree to the king ofQ participating in a\nmassacre of the state. As Wayiu was\npondering this, Zhu Bao revealed a\nhelpless smile. This fool actually\nthinks that father and I have been\ndeceived by you. I have no idea what\nhe's thinking. After Zhu Bao finished\nspeaking, Wayiu was finally able to\nchime in. However, he did not mention\nwhat had just happened with Lan Yu, but\nwent straight to the issue of the\nJapanese pirates. Brotherhu, your eye\nfor talent is impeccable. Sending Lan Yu\nto handle this matter is absolutely\nperfect. Although Weii Wu never\nmentioned Lan Yu&lt;unk&gt;s intrusion into\nhis home, he had already given his\nanswer. In the past, Zhu Yuan Jang and\nZhu Bao viewed Ciao Xiao more as a\nyounger generation. But now, their gazes\ntoward Wei Wu held a hint of admiration.\nNow that the farce was over, the two had\nno intention of lingering with Wei Wu\nand immediately prepared to return to\nthe palace. However, at this moment,\nWeii Wu suddenly spoke up. \"Uncle Zu, I\nquite like Shinllin and the others. I'd\nlike to ask you to let them be sent\nback.\" Zhu Yuan Jang laughed heartily.\nSince you've already asked, we&lt;unk&gt;ll\ngive these people to you. From now on,\nthey'll guard your house and protect\nyour property. I will send others over\nfrom outside. You're a treasure and we\ncan't bear to see anything happen to\nyou. Oh, right. There's something else\nwe need to ask you. How did things turn\nout in later generations? But it's too\nlate now. Let's talk about it another\ntime. After saying this, Zhu Yuan Jang\nled a large group of people away in a\ngrand procession. After all this\ncommotion, Wayi Wu lost all interest in\nhaving fun. After dismissing a few\nmaids, he went straight back to his room\nto rest. On the other side, after Zu\nYuan Jong and Zhu Bao returned to the\npalace, Zhu Bao first went to Function\nHall. Upon returning to the East Palace,\nhe immediately summoned Leaf Fong. Not\nlong after, Lan Yu, who had been\nimprisoned in a death row cell,\nreappeared in the East Palace Garden.\nYou should be glad that Wayi Wu isn't\nthe type to hold grudges. Otherwise, you\nwouldn't have survived tonight. Looking\nat Lan Yu kneeling on the ground, Zhu\nBao did not call him uncle this time.\nLonu understood from Zhuao&lt;unk&gt;'s tone,\naddress, and attitude. I have truly\nangered the emperor and the crown prince\nthis time. Do you think you're smarter\nthan father and me, or do you think you\ncan fool father and me with mere\ncharlatanry? Upon hearing Zhu Bowo's\nwords, Lanu immediately collapsed to the\nground. Your majesty, I dare not. It is\nmy foolishness that is the fault. I beg\nyour majesty to punish me. After a long\nwhile, without hearing a response from\nZhu Bao, Lanu did not dare to raise her\nhead. After a long while, Lan Yu, who\nwas filled with anxiety, finally heard\nZhu Bao&lt;unk&gt;s voice. Lan Yu, would you\nlike to see the world beyond the heavens\nand know what the moon really looks\nlike? This completely unrelated remark\nleft Lan Yu speechless for a long time.\nJust as he was wondering, Zhu Bao slowly\nspoke. Rise. Today I will show you why\nmy father and I treated Weii Wu with\nsuch courtesy. With Zua&lt;unk&gt;s approval,\nLan Yu quickly got up from the ground.\nLooking up, he saw a strangely shaped\nobject next to the prince. The upper\npart of the tube is white with some\nstrange black patterns on it, and its\nshape is like a son-off bamboo tube. The\nlower part consists of three black\nsupports. Just as Lana was wondering, he\nsaw Zhu Bao beckoning, so he immediately\nwent forward. Subsequently, under Zhu\nBow&lt;unk&gt;s guidance, Lanu saw with her\nown eyes what the moon looked like. When\na grayish white sphere appeared in his\neyes, Lanu trembled. Looking at Lan Yu,\nwho was frozen in a daysaze and whose\nbody was stiff, Zhuao shook his head and\nsighed, saying, \"Long, take Lanu back to\nthe death row.\" After speaking, Zhuao\nturned to look at Lanu again. \"Go.\nYou'll spend the next few days in death\nrow reflecting on your actions.\" After\nZu Bao finished speaking, Leon\nreappeared, preparing to leave the East\nPalace with the dedu. However, at that\nmoment, a figure rushed into the East\nPalace and knelt down in front of Zhua\nwith a thud. Upon closer inspection, Zhu\nBao realized that the visitor was a\nyoung palace maid. \"Your Highness, the\nEmpress has sent me to inform you that\nthe crown prince has suddenly fallen ill\nwith a fever and fainted. Once sent in\nstruck Zhu Bao like a bolt from the\nblue. In that instant, Zhu Bao felt as\nif the sky was about to fall because\nwhat We Woo had said come true. In fact,\nhe had been worried these past two days\nabout what would happen if this really\nhappened. Less than 3 months after her\nson's death, her mother was also about\nto pass away. Zhu Bao had initially held\non to a sliver of hope, but now that it\nhad actually happened before his eyes.\nAt this moment, Zhu Bao finally\nunderstood what despair meant. Yes. Weii\nWu and Weii Wu again. He must have a\nway. Leong, go and invite Weii Wu to the\npalace. Remember, it's invite. Lanu go\nback to the death row. After saying\nthis, Zhuao, who was extremely anxious,\nimmediately went to cunning palace, but\nwas stopped by a palace maid. Your\nhighness, the empress has said that she\nis only informing you and you are not\npermitted to travel to cunning. Bang.\nBefore the palace maid could finish\nspeaking, Zhu Bao pushed her aside and\nran out of the east palace. Chapter 29.\nUrgent summoning in the dead of night.\nSmallpox confirmed. Watching Zhu Bao's\nhurry departure, Lan Yu was extremely\nanxious. At the national level, Zhu\nXiangying was Zhu Bao&lt;unk&gt;s eldest son\nand the future crown prince. Even among\nrelatives, he was addressed as uncle.\nNow that his child is sick and in a\ncoma, how can he not be anxious?\nHowever, Zhu Xionging was in the inner\npalace, a place that lawn you could not\nenter. Moreover, he is currently a\nconvict and death row is the only place\nhe can go. On the other side, Zhuao ran\nall the way after leaving the east\npalace and finally arrived at the gate\nof Cunning Palace. However, the palace\ngates were heavily guarded by maids and\nUnix, giving you no chance to enter the\npalace. Get out of the way. I order all\nof you to stand back. Zu Bao gave a loud\norder, but the palace maids and Unix\nsimply knelt on the ground and refused\nto move aside. Just as Zu Bao was about\nto force his way in, a Unix suddenly\nspoke up. Your highness, her majesty the\nempress has decreed that if you force\nyour way in a cunning palace. It would\nbe unfil and she will be very angry. A\nsimple sentence was enough to keep Zhu\nBao pinned to the spot. The palace gates\nwere so close yet he dared not take\nanother step. Seeing that Zhu Bao was no\nlonger trying to force his way in, the\nunic took out a piece of paper from his\npocket. However, instead of handing the\npaper to Zubao, he opened it and held it\nout for Zua to see. Since the cause is\nuncertain, one should not personally\ntake the risk. Upon seeing these 10\nwords, Zhuao immediately understood what\nEmpress Ma meant. Wayiu once said that\nit was impossible to determine whether\nZhu Xionging died of smallpox or from a\ncold. If it's just a cold, it's nothing\nto worry about, but if it's smallox,\nthat disease is contagious.\nUnderstanding what Empress Ma was\nworried about, Zhu Bao completely gave\nup on forcing his way in and then\nordered someone to summon the Imperial\nphysician. Just then, Zhu Yuan Jang\narrived at Cunning Palace, but was also\nblocked at the palace gate and unable to\nenter. The Unix and palace maids\nnaturally dared not stop them, but they\nalso dared not clear the way. They could\nonly endure Zu Yu and J's punches and\nkicks without daring to move. And then\njust when they were about to give up in\ncunning palace, Empress Ma&lt;unk&gt;s words\nmade Juu Yuan Jang stop in his tracks.\nLeft with no other choice, Zhu Yuan Jang\nwent to Zhu Bao&lt;unk&gt;s side. Bow or what\nillness does Xing suffer from? Father, I\nwas unaware of this. I have already\nsummoned the imperial physician. An old\nman and a young boy stood in front of\nthe cunning palace gate, looking\nanxiously in the direction of a gate.\nNot long after, the imperial physician\nfinally arrived, but was interrupted by\nZhu Yuan Jang before he could even\nperform the proper rights. Today, you\nare the one examining the crown prince.\nTell me, what illness does the crown\nprince suffer from? The imperial\nphysician was so frightened by Zhu Yuan\nJang that he trembled all over and his\nvoice shook uncontrollably. Your\nmajesty, when I took his pulse, his\nhighness, the crown prince, did not have\nany obvious external symptoms. He only\nsaid that he was tired, had a headache,\nand felt palpitations. I then prescribed\na calming and tranquilizing remedy. At\nthe second watch of the night, the\nemperor summoned me urgently, and I\nexamined the grandson's pulse again and\ndiscovered that he had a fever. Then his\nhighness the crown prince complained of\nback pain, and all the symptoms matched.\nYour majesty, your majesty. The Imperial\nphysician stammered and struggled for a\nlong time without giving an answer,\nwhich angered Ju Yuan Jong so much that\nhe grabbed the physician by the collar.\nI asked you what illness your grandson\nis suffering from, but you've given me a\nbunch of nonsense. If you keep rambling,\nI'll chop you up. If if the grandson\ndevelops a rash in the next 2 days, I\nfear I fear it is smallox a terrible\ndisease. It wasn't that the imperial\nphysician wanted to be verbose. Rather,\nhe simply didn't dare to easily reveal\nthe illness. The reason is simple.\nSmallox was called a terrible disease in\nancient times, an incurable evil\ndisease. At the beginning of the Ming\ndynasty, a serious illness suddenly\nappeared in the palace, which was\nrumored by some people to be a divine\nretribution. But with Zhu Yuan Jang\nholding a knife to his throat, the\nimperial physicians had no choice but to\nspeak out, no matter how much they dared\nnot. Although Xu Yuan Jang was prepared,\nthe words smallpox still stung his\nheart, he desperately hoped that his\neldest grandson had only caught a cold.\nAlthough a cold can be fatal, at least\nthere is hope for treatment. Smallox was\na deadly disease that had no cure.\nPatients could only rely on themselves\nto fight it off and gamble with their\nlives. If they lost the gamble, they\nwould die. \"Smallox! Small pox! Why have\nall smallpox?\" Zhu Yuan Jong muttered to\nhimself absent-mindedly, then suddenly\nremembered something. Why did Xianging\ncontract smallox? There's never been a\nserious disease in the palace before.\nWhere did this disease come from?\nThinking of this, Zhu Yuan Jang\nimmediately looked at Zhu Bowo and\nasked, \"Bower, has XY left the palace\ngates recently?\" Zhu Bao guessed what Zu\nYuan Jan was thinking and immediately\nreplied, \"No, I originally planned to\ntake Xianging out of the palace for\ninspection in the next two days, but\nafter my father took me to see Wayi Wu,\nI gave up.\" \"We woo?\" \"Yes, we woo!\"\nimmediately sent someone to bring Weii\nWu to the palace. \"Father, I have\nalready sent someone.\" Just as old Ju\nand his son were talking, Wayi Wu was\nalso woken up. The maids wanted to help\nhim undress. But Wei Wu found it\ntroublesome and came to the hall in his\npajamas. Looking at the pale-faced,\nbeardless unic in front of him, who\nresembled a wandering ghost, Wayi Woo\nsighed and rubbed his forehead in\nexasperation. The arrival of a unic\nmeant something had happened in the\npalace. But the timing was giving him a\nreal headache, disturbing my sleep in\nthe middle of the night is unbearable.\nWeii Wu was still a little dazed and\ncouldn't help but rub his eyes. However,\nthe unic's next words completely brought\nWeii Wu to his senses. Young Master Wei,\nhis highness, the crown prince, has\nsuddenly fallen ill with a fever and\nfainted. His highness has ordered me to\ncome and invite you to the palace. Is\nZhu Xionging sick? Fever? Fainting? In\nmodern terms, it's fainting caused by a\nfever. And this condition can range from\nminor to serious. Could it be that Zhu\nXiongying&lt;unk&gt;s real cause of death in\nhistory was a cold? Way wasn't a medical\nstudent and didn't know much about\nmedicine. It sounded like symptoms of a\ncold. A common viral cold does not\nnecessarily cause a high fever, but a\nbacterial cold can cause a persistent\nhigh fever. Based on what he learned\nfrom the unic, we wu assumed that Zhu\nXiang Ing had only a bacterial cold.\nAfter all, there was no such distinction\nin ancient times. Everything was called\nwind cold and it could be fatal.\nThinking of this, Wayi Wu took out a box\nof amoxicylin directly from the system\nwarehouse. But he suddenly froze when he\nlooked at the medicine box in his hand.\nThis stuff contains penicellin. Zu\nXionging is seriously ill right now and\nI don't know how to test for allergies.\nWhat if he's allergic to penicellin? If\nI give him this one pill, he might just\ndie on the spot. With that thought in\nmind, Wayi Wu immediately took back the\nemoxicylin and replaced it with a box of\nsephilosporins. Although [snorts] a\npenicellin allergy can also lead to a\nsephosporn allergy, the probability is\nrelatively low. After preparing the\nmedicine and changing his clothes, Wayi\nWu followed Leaf Fong out of the\nresidence. With the Unix from the crown\nprince's side leading the way, neither\nthe city patrols nor the palace guards\ndared to stop them. The journey was\nsmooth and unimpeded and they soon\narrived outside the cunning palace. He\nglanced at the people kneeling in front\nof the cunning palace and then saw Zhu\nYuan Jang and Zhu Bao standing not far\naway. We wu quickly stepped forward and\nbowed in greeting. Comeer Wei Wu. Before\nWei Wu could finish speaking, Zhu Yuan\nJang grabbed him. All right, Shia Wu,\nwhat time is it? Stop with the\nformalities. Zu Yu and Jang&lt;unk&gt;s simple\nwords stunned everyone around him. Has\nhis majesty ever been this kind? Is this\nstill the same aloof and supreme emperor\nwhen you were punching and kicking us\njust now? You weren't this kind and\nfriendly at all. However, Zhu Yuan Jang\ndidn't care what they were thinking and\nsimply pulled Wu aside. Shiao Wu the\nImperial physician said that if Xionging\ndevelops a rash in the next two days, it\nis very likely smallox. Upon hearing\nthis, we wu silently put away the\nsephilosporin. Chapter 30. Smallpox\nsuspicion remains unresolved. Zhu Yuan\nJang enraged if Zhu Xianging had just\ncaught a cold. We Wu could have figured\nout a way to deal with it. But even with\nhis system, he was helpless against\nsmallpox. After taking one last look at\nthe palace maids and Unix guarding the\npalace gates. Weii Wu finally understood\nwhy such a large-scale operation was\nbeing carried out. He sighed inwardly.\nThen Wei Wu said softly, \"Uncle Zu, are\nyou really sure it's smallox?\" Upon\nhearing Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s question, Zhu Yuan\nJang quickly repeated what the Imperial\nphysician had said. High fever, fatigue,\nheadache, palpitations, or rapid\nheartbeat, and back pain. Upon hearing\nthese symptoms, Wei Wu felt the chill\nrun down his spine. These were typical\nearly symptoms of smallpox. After a\nmoment of contemplation, Weii Wu finally\nspoke. That should be right. These are\nthe initial symptoms of smallpox. After\nspeaking, Wayi Wu immediately fell in a\ndeep thought because something puzzled\nhim. How did Juang suddenly contract\nsmallox? If small pox had broken out in\nthe palace, Zhu Yuan Jang would have\nordered isolation long ago or even\nkilled those infected. How could she\npossibly allow smallpox to continue\nspreading, let alone reach her most\nimportant grandson? It is certain that\nsmall pox did not occur in the palace.\nSo, how did Ju Xionging get smallox?\nThinking of this, Wayi Wu simply asked\ndirectly, \"Uncle Zu, has his highness\nthe crown prince left the palace in the\npast two weeks? Also, has smallpox been\nreported in the palace before?\" Zhu Yuan\nJang also knew that small pox could be\ntransmitted, so he simply assumed that\nChow Chow was inquiring about the\nsource. I asked Bower and he originally\nplanned to take Shionging out of the\npalace for inspection, but after meeting\nyou, he stopped planning to go out.\nFurthermore, I have sent people to\ninvestigate and no one in the palace had\ncontracted smallox before Ua High\nSchool, so it shouldn't be a rumor. Upon\nhearing this, we wu understood that Zhu\nYuan Jang was limited by the times.\nPeople in this era only knew that small\npox could be transmitted from person to\nperson, but they didn't know that small\npox could only be transmitted from\nothers. Although humans are the only\nhost of the smallox virus, the virus\ndoes not suddenly appear in the human\nbody. It's impossible to suddenly get\nsmallox for no reason. It's only\npossible to be infected by someone else.\nThinking of this, Wayi Wu simply\nexplained it to Zhu Yuan Jang directly.\nUncle Zhu, smallox is different from a\ncold. A cold can originate from within\noneself. But smallpox can only be\ntransmitted from others. That's why I\nasked you those two questions earlier\nbecause his highness, the crown prince,\nmust have contracted smallpox from\nsomeone else. After we Wu finished\nspeaking, Zhu Yuan Jang, who was\noriginally immersed in grief,\nimmediately erupted with an extremely\nintense, killing intent. Even Zhu Bao,\nwho was standing to the side, had\nbloodshot eyes and a terrifying\nexpression on his face. Then Wei Wu\nheard Zhu Yuan Jang&lt;unk&gt;s voice, which\nwas as cold as the deepest hell. Shiao\nWu, are you serious? Weii Wu nodded and\nthen continued to explain. In our time,\nalthough we could only prevent it and\nnot cure it, we did a lot of research on\nsmall pox. Smallox virus infection has\nan incubation period of 7 to 17 days and\nsymptoms usually appear 9 to 12 days\nlater. During the incubation period, his\nbody is no different from that of an\nordinary person, which is why I asked\nthe crown prince whether he had left the\npalace in the past half month. Zu Yuan\nJang and Zu Bao were both extremely\nintelligent. Although I don't understand\nwhat the incubation period is, I can\nroughly understand it after listening to\nWayi Wu&lt;unk&gt;s explanation. What is the\nmost crucial question? This disease\ndoesn't develop on its own. It can only\nbe transmitted from others. There's been\nno smallox outbreak in the palace and\nZhu Xiang Ing has not left the palace in\nthe last half month. But Zu Xonging was\nthe only one who fell ill. It was\nsmallox, a disease that could only be\ncontracted from others. This cannot be\nexplained away as a mere coincidence.\nThere must be someone manipulating\nthings behind the scenes. Looking at the\ntightly closed palace gate, Zhu Yuan\nJang suppressed his anger and asked\nagain, \"Shia Wu, is it really true that\nthere's absolutely no way for future\ngenerations to do this? Didn't you say\nthat someone had studied it? Tell us\nabout any method, even if there's only a\nsliver of hope, even if it's risky.\"\nWayi Wu sensed the grief in Zhu Yuan\nJang&lt;unk&gt;s tone and couldn't help but\nsigh. Planago asiatica, hediotis\ndiffusa, elusine indacica, dandelion and\nisatus indigotica might be somewhat\nuseful. However, these herbs only treat\nthe symptoms caused by smallpox and have\nno effect on small pox itself. Even a\nsliver of hope is a sliver of hope.\nAfter hearing what we Wu said, Zhu Yuan\nJang immediately summoned the imperial\nphysician and asked him to write down\nthese herbs. After the imperial\nphysician left, Zhu Yuan Jang ordered\nsomeone to summon Mao Xiang thoroughly\ninvestigate the capital. We need to know\nwho all the people who were infected\nwith smallox within the past month have\nmet and where they have been.\nFurthermore, all those who have had\ncontact with the crown prince and have\ntaken care of his daily life should be\narrested and thoroughly investigated to\ndetermine if they have any records of\nleaving the palace. Upon hearing this,\nMaong immediately understood that the\ncrown prince had contracted smallox.\nThis is a huge deal. Without any\nhesitation, Maang immediately responded.\n\"Yes, your majesty. I will investigate\nimmediately.\" After saying that, Maong\nimmediately got up and ran out of the\npalace. Just then, the gate of cunning\npalace suddenly opened and a maid\ncarrying a copper basin came out of the\nroom. Upon seeing this, Zhu Bao was\nabout to step forward to ask, but we wu\ngrabbed him. Brotherhu, don't get too\nclose. This disease can be transmitted\nthrough the air. Upon hearing this, Zhu\nBao stopped moving forward, but still\nlooked at the palace maid and asked her\nquestion. Tell me, how are mother and\nXing? Your highness, the empress is\nwell, but the crown prince's fever\npersists. I will fetch water to wipe his\nhighness's body. Hearing the palace\nmaid's reply, Zhu Bao felt extremely\ndistressed. Looking at Zhu Bao&lt;unk&gt;s\nworried face, Weii Wu sighed softly.\n\"Brother Zhu, let me go in and take a\nlook. I happen to have some things here\nthat can help alleviate the fever.\" Zhu\nXiang Ing is only 8 years old. His\npersistent high fever could potentially\ncause brain damage. Fortunately, Wayu\nhad a few boxes of fever reducing\npatches, which could at least help Zhu\nXionging with physical cooling. But as\nsoon as Wayi Wu finished speaking, Zhu\nYuan Jang and Zhu Bao became anxious and\nstopped him at the same time. No. To be\nhonest, Wayi Wu didn't expect them to be\nso excited, and he was startled. Just as\nhe was wondering, Zhu Yuan Jang spoke\nup. Shiao Wu, the palace maids could\ndeliver the items, but you must not risk\nyour life yourself. Only then did We Wu\nrealize that they were worried he might\nalso contract smallpox. So he\nimmediately laughed and said, \"Don't\nworry, Uncle Zu. People of our\ngeneration were vaccinated against\nsmallpox from childhood, so he won't get\ninfected.\" After saying that, Wayi Wu\nrealized that they didn't understand\nwhat a vaccine was, so he explained it\nagain. It's a method similar to smallox\nvaccination. Anyway, you just need to\nknow that I won't get smallox. Hearing\nWe Woo say this, the two were somewhat\nrelieved, but they still had some\nhesitation in their hearts. On an\nemotional level, they hoped Wayi Wu\nwould join them. Perhaps he could be of\nsome help. But rationally, they all knew\none thing. Wayi Wu absolutely could not\nbe allowed to get into trouble. Zhu\nXianging was concerned with the\nfoundation of the nation. But Wayi Wu\nwas already bound to the fate of the\nMing dynasty. As long as Zhu Bao is\nalive, the foundation of the nation can\nbe restored. But if Chow Chow were to\ndie, the losses would be immeasurable.\nIt may seem cold-blooded, but since\nancient times, imperial families have\nalways prioritized the country. Even\nemperors like Zhu Yuan Jang, who placed\ngreat importance on family ties, were no\nexception. Chapter 31 in Cunning Palace.\nClues reveal the true culprit. In fact,\nWayi Wu took the initiative to enter\nCunning Palace not to show off in front\nof Zhu Yuan Jang. To put it bluntly, if\nsmallox hadn't posed no threat to him,\nhe wouldn't have even come to the\npalace. If I get infected, wouldn't my\nwonderful life, which has just begun,\nvanish an instant? He volunteered to\nenter Cunning Palace simply because he\nwas curious about the inner palace since\nthere's no danger and it can boost my\nfavorability. Why not? So, while the\nfather and son hesitated, we wu turned\naround and walked directly toward the\ngate of Cunning Palace. Unlike Zhu Yuan\nJang and his son, the palace maids and\nUnix on the road did not stop Wu. Your\nmajesty, I am Wei Wu. May I come in?\nUpon arriving at the palace gate, Wei Wu\ndid not push the door open directly, but\nknocked and called out. No sooner had he\nfinished shouting than Empress Ma's\nextremely tense voice came from inside\nthe room, Shiau, what are you doing\nhere? Get out of here. Don't come in.\nThis disease is contagious. At that\nmoment, Empress Ma inwardly cursed Zu\nYuan Jang terribly. Weii Wu&lt;unk&gt;s\nimportance is beyond doubt. Yet, Zhu\nYuan Jang didn't stop him. What if Wayi\nWu had caught the virus? Did she want\nWeu to come in? Of course, she did, as\nhe might be the only one who could save\nZhu Xianging. But she knew even more\nclearly that nothing was more important\nthan the fate of the Ming dynasty. And\nher grandson was no exception. On Wei\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s side, he immediately smiled\nupon hearing Empress Ma's voice. He\nunderstood what Empress Ma was worried\nabout. So he immediately began to\nexplain. Your majesty, please rest\nassured. I don't know how to explain it\nto you. Just think of it as me having\nalready had smallpox. Upon hearing this,\nEmpress Ma finally breathed a sigh of\nrelief. Then came a series of hurried\nfootsteps. And soon after, Empress Ma\nopened the palace gates. After opening\nthe door, Empress Ma first glanced at\nZhu Yuan Jang and Zu Bao. her eyes\nfilled with complex emotions. Since she\nherself had never had smallpox and she\nwas taking care of Zhu Xianging closely,\nshe must have contracted this terrible\ndisease. She will likely fall ill soon,\nat which point she may be separated from\nher husband and son forever. But\nEmperor's Ma only glanced at him before\nimmediately taking Weii Wu into the\npalace. As Emperor's Ma approached the\nbedside, Wei Wu glanced at the young Zhu\nXianging, then shook his head\nhelplessly. The rash has already\nappeared, so there's no doubt that it is\nsmallox virus. Ama, the crown prince is\nyoung. If he continues to have a high\nfever, it may damage his body or even\nhis brain. As he spoke, Wayi Wu took out\na fever reducing patch and handed it to\nEmpress Ma. This thing is called a fever\nreducing patch. It is applied to the\ncrown prince's forehead, palms, and\nsoles of his feet to help lower his body\ntemperature. As Weii Wu spoke, he\nunpacked the package in front of Empress\nMa and demonstrated how to use it. I put\na cooling patch on my forehead, and then\ntook out another one, cut it open, and\nput on the soles of my feet. After\nfinishing, Wayi Wu looked at Zhu Xiong\nYying&lt;unk&gt;s tender little face with long\neyelashes, red lips, and white teeth.\nShe looked like a sleeping little angel.\nHowever, this little angel was seriously\nill at the moment, and his brows were\nfull of pain. Saving a life is better\nthan building a seven-story pigota. But\nunfortunately, I really don't have the\nability to save you, little one. Seeing\nZhu Xiong Yying&lt;unk&gt;s pained expression,\nWeii Wu thought to himself. Just then,\nEmpress Ma's slightly hesitant question\ncame from beside him, \"Shia Wu, do you\nreally have no other ideas?\" Weii Wu\nturned around, looked at Empress\nMa&lt;unk&gt;s miserable face, and shook his\nhead helplessly. Seeing way Wu shake his\nhead, Empress Ma's eyes darkened. But\nshe did not give up. So your magical\nmethod allows you to obtain things every\nso often, right? Is it possible? Empress\nMa's reminder made Wei Wu realize that\nit was already past midnight and he\nhadn't opened the package for today.\nAlthough the chances of getting smallox\nmedication are slim, it's still a\npossible approach. I can get something\ntoday, Emma. I'll give it a try, but the\nchances are probably not very high. As\nlong as there's hope. After Empress Ma\nfinished speaking, Wayi Wu immediately\ncommunicated with the system. Looking at\nthe three packages floating in the air,\nI couldn't help but feel a sense of\nanticipation. Medicine. Medicine.\nPreferably smallox medicine. May you\nhave boundless omitba. While thinking to\nhimself, Wu directly selected the\npackage on the left that looked like a\nshoe box. However, when it was opened,\nit turned out to be a box, but one\ncontaining a toy car. My child is about\nto die and you're giving me toys. Are\nyou kidding me? While inwardly\ncomplaining, Wayi Wu turned to look at\nEmpress Ma and shook his head. That\ndidn't get the medicine, they only got\nsome children's toys. As he spoke, Wayi\nWu flipped his wrist and took out the\nbox of toy cars. Looking at the box in\nWei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s hand. Empress Ma's tears\nalso slid down her cheeks. The\npsychological gap between expectation\nand disappointment is most likely to\ncause emotional outbursts. We would\ndidn't know how to comfort him, so he\nlooked around and then got up and walked\nto the side. There's a wooden box here\nfilled with many wooden toys and sewn\ncloth dolls. I'm afraid no one will play\nthese things anymore in the future. Weey\nWoo sighed softly, squatted down, and\nplaced the toy car box next to the\nwooden crate. But just as he was about\nto get up, he suddenly saw a Lubon lock.\nBut the Lubon lock itself isn't the main\npoint. The main point is something stuck\nto it. He picked up the Lubon lock and\nexamined it closely. It turned out to be\na scab the size of soybean. The scab has\na slight bump in the middle, making it\nlook like a dried up chickenpox leion.\nBecause the color of the scab is very\nsimilar to the color of the wood in the\nLubon lock, it is not easy to tell the\ndifference unless you look closely. But\nhow come there's a scab in the crown\nprince's toy box? Then we wu turned to\nlook at Empress Ma, who is still\nweeping. Aunt Ma, isn't this the crown\nprince's toy box? Has anyone touched it\nsince it was brought here? Upon hearing\nWei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s voice, Empress Ma finally\nlooked up. No, I brought Xiong Ying to\nCunning Palace yesterday, and no one in\nthe palace has touched XY&lt;unk&gt;s things.\nWhen it was delivered that day, Ua\nplayed with it for a while, but quickly\nput it away. Upon hearing Empress Ma's\ndescription, Wayi Wu immediately\nfrowned. In other words, this scab was\nalready in this box beforehing\nwas taken to Kuwan Ning Palace. If Wayi\nWu had only guessed that someone had\ndeliberately used smallox to harm Zhu\nXianging. So now it's almost certain\nthat it was man-made. Just as Wei Wu was\ndeep in thought, Empress Ma also got up\nand came to his side. Xiao Wu, what's\nwrong? Weii Wu came to his senses and\nhanded the Lubon lock directly to\nEmpress Ma. Emma Ma, look at the things\non this Lubon lock. Don't they look like\nthe scabs on the body of someone who has\ncontracted smallox? If I'm not mistaken,\nhis highness, the crown prince, was\ndeliberately framed and contracted\nsmallox. Upon hearing this, Empress Ma\nimmediately looked at Lu Banlock, and\nthen her eyes were filled with endless\nanger, devoid of any sorrow. Shia Wu,\ncan this scab be passed on to others?\nChapter 32. Crown Princess Lou is\nfinished. We would didn't know what\nEmpress Mom meant by asking this, but he\nstill answered truthfully. It can mostly\nbe transmitted from person to person.\nSmallox is actually a creature even\nsmaller than a goo poisoning, which is\ncalled a virus. This virus can survive\nfor months at room temperature if it\nattaches to scabs, dust, or clothing.\nAfter listening to Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s\nexplanation, Empress Ma asked again,\n\"Then can we isolate it to prevent it\nfrom spreading to humans?\" \"Can?\" As he\nspoke, Wayi Wu took out a sealed bag and\nsealed the scab inside. At this point,\nhe had already guessed what Emperor's\nmom meant. She simply wanted to show\nthis to Zhu Yuan Jang, but they were\nafraid that old Zu might get smallox, so\nthey asked him. Although Weii Wu&lt;unk&gt;s\ncurrent approach cannot completely\nisolate the virus, it has at least\nminimized its transmissibility. As long\nas Lo and Xiao Zhu wear masks and avoid\ndirect contact, there will be no risk of\ninfection. As expected, just as Wei Wu\nhad guessed, after he sealed this gab,\nEmpress Ma handed over a brocade box and\nsaid, \"Shia Wu, I'll have to trouble you\nto show this to Chongba and Bower.\" Weii\nWu said nothing. put the sealed bag into\nthe brocade box and then took out a\nbottle of medical alcohol and sprayed a\nfew times. After closing the brocade\nbox, he got up and left Cunning Palace\ncarrying the box. As soon as he stepped\nout of the palace gate, he saw Zhu Yuan\nJang and Zhu Bao walking towards him. So\nhe quickly shouted, \"Your Majesty, Your\nHighness, the Crown Prince, please wait.\nPlease have someone prepare hot water\nand a change of clothes for me\nimmediately.\" As he spoke, Wayi Wu\nplaced the brocade box on the ground and\ntook out medical alcohol again to spray\nit continuously. Your majesty, I'll\nleave this box here. No one is allowed\nto touch it until I return after bathing\nand changing. After we woo finished\nspeaking, Zhu Yuan Jang immediately\narranged for palace servants to prepare\nhot water and clothes and took Wei Wu to\nbathe. At the same time, he ordered that\nno one was allowed to touch the brocade\nbox. Actually, it's not fair to blame\nWei Wu for being so cautious. Zu Yuan\nJang was his biggest backer in the Ming\ndynasty. Anyone can get into trouble,\nbut Zu Yuan Jang absolutely cannot.\nBetter safe than sorry. After bathing\nand changing, Wei Wu returned to Cunning\nPalace, took out two masks, and helped\nZhu Yuan Jang and Zhu Bao put them on.\nAfter dismissing everyone, he approached\nZhu Yuan Jang with a brocade box and\nwhispered, \"Uncle Zu, his highness, the\ncrown prince, has developed a rash, and\nit is now certain that he has contracted\nsmallox.\" Upon hearing these words, the\nlast glimmer of hope in the hearts of\nZhu Yuan Jang and Zhu Bao was shattered.\nNext, Wayi Wu opened the brocade box and\ntook the seal bag out of it. If nothing\nunexpected happens, this thing should be\na scab from a smallox patient which was\nfound in the Crown Prince toy box. Don't\nworry, I've sealed it away and taken\nspecial measures to protect it. You\nwon't get sick if you don't touch it\ndirectly. I asked Auntma and she said\nthat after this toy box was moved from\nthe East Palace, no one in Cunning\nPalace except for the crown prince has\never touched it. After he finished\nspeaking, Wayi Wu repeated the concept\nof the virus to the two of them. Zhu\nYuan Jang listened while looking at the\nsealed bag in Wayi Wu&lt;unk&gt;s hand, his\nface remaining expressionless\nthroughout. Zhua&lt;unk&gt;s face was deafly\npale, his eyes filled with a mixture of\ngrief, anger, and sadness. Just then,\nZhu Yuan Jang suddenly turned to look at\nJuao. You've managed to crown prince's\npalace well. After saying this, Zhu Yuan\nJang turned and left Cunning Palace\nwhile Zhu Bao&lt;unk&gt;s expression changed.\nGone were the complex emotions from\nbefore. Only a chilling extreme coldness\nremained. Seeing this, Weii Wu silently\nthought to himself, \"Crown Princess Lou\nis finished.\" That's right. Crown\nPrincess Lu is finished. Although Xiao\nChow only presented the suspicious\npoints from beginning to end, he never\nnamed anyone. But was Xu Yuan Jang a\nfool? If he were a fool, he wouldn't\nhave been able to sit on the throne of\nthe Ming Dynasty. Was Zu Bao a fool? If\nhe were a fool, Zhu Yuan Jang wouldn't\nhave made him crowned prince so early\non. While these two individuals may not\nbe considered exceptionally intelligent,\nthey are certainly shrewd and astute.\nThe points of doubt raised by Wei Wu are\nso obvious that even an ordinary person\ncould guess the general idea. Zhu Xiong\nYying&lt;unk&gt;s daily life was confined to\nthe East Palace and Kuan Ning Palace,\nand few people had accessed him. As for\nthose people, let alone not having the\nguts, even if they did have the guts,\nthey wouldn't do something like\nexterminating nine generations of their\nfamily. Only the crown princess Lou\ndared to do such a thing, and she also\nhad enough motive and opportunity to do\nit. Zu Yuan Jan&lt;unk&gt;s words just now\nsounded like he was angry or blaming\nsomeone. In reality, he left the matter\nto Zhu Bao to handle himself since it\nwas a matter concerning the crown\nprince. To be honest, even Wayi Wu\ncouldn't guess what Zhu Bao would do.\nBut one thing is certain, the crown\nprincess Lu's fate was not good because\nZu Yuan Jang was watching. If Zhu Bao\nstill cherishes the bond between husband\nand wife, then Zu Yuan Jang will have to\ntake action personally. To be honest,\nWayi Wu suddenly felt a little\nembarrassed at this moment. Zu Yuan Jang\nleft and Zu Bao stood there with a cold\nface, neither speaking nor leaving. He's\nin a dilemma right now. It's not good\nfor him to leave. It's not good for him\nto stay. Fortunately, this awkward\nsituation did not last long and was\nresolved by the sudden appearance of\nWong Jong Wan. Young Master Wei, his\nmajesty has sent me to invite you over.\nAfter bringing Wei Wu to Funen Hall,\nWong Jong Wan immediately withdrew from\nthe hall and close the doors. Upon\nseeing Zhu Yuan Jang sitting on the\ndragon throne, Weii Wu immediately bowed\nin respect. However, before he could\neven bend down, Zhu Yuan Jang stood up\nand waved his hand. All right, in\nprivate, I am your uncle Zu. There's no\nneed for these formalities. Come and sit\nwith me for a while. As they were\ntalking, Zhu Yuan Jang, accompanied by\nWei Wu pllopped down on the steps below\nthe dragon throne. Shia Wu, tell me the\ntruth. If we vaccinate our sister with\ncowpox now, will it prevent small pox?\nRegarding the smallox vaccine issue,\nMaang side has not yet reached a\nconclusion. The main problem is that the\ntime frame is too short. It has only\nbeen three days since Zhu Yuan Jang\nissued the order. Zhu Yuan Jang brought\nit up now because he had no other choice\nbut to gamble on Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s trust.\nBecause after Zu Xongy&lt;unk&gt;s death,\nEmpress Ma only had less than 3 months\nto live. If nothing unexpected happens,\nit can now be basically confirmed that\nEmpress Ma died of smallox. Wei way knew\nwhat answer Zu Yuan Jang wanted to hear,\nbut he could not possibly speak on such\na matter. I'm sorry, Uncle Zu. Emma took\ncare of the crown prince so closely that\nshe was completely exposed to the\nsmallox virus. Amma is very likely\nalready infected, but the virus is still\nin the incubation period and the\nsymptoms have not yet appeared.\nVaccination with smallox vaccine under\nthese circumstances. It said that men do\nnot easily shed tears, but Juu Yu and\nJong&lt;unk&gt;s eyes were already wet at this\nmoment, though the tears did not fall.\nSeeing this, we wu couldn't continue\nspeaking. The two sat on the steps in\nsilence for a long time before Zhu Yuan\nJang finally spoke again. Actually, I\nknew this would be the result, but\npeople are always a little unwilling to\naccept it. Shying for now, and you don't\nneed to call me crown prince anymore.\nCall me Uncle Zu or brother Zu Bau. Then\nhe will be your nephew from now on. Call\nhim Xionging. I only wish this child a\nbright future. Weii Wu was speechless.\nHe didn't know how to comfort the old\nman before him. Fortunately, the\npowerful ruler did not need comforting\nand quickly recovered his composure\nafter a brief period of sadness. Shia\nWu, I'd like to hear your opinion on the\nsmallox matter. Do you think it's the\nLou family's fault? Chapter 33 will\ncontain spoilers again. Sorry, Judy. To\nbe honest, Wayi Wu did suspect that it\nwas the crown princess Louu who did it\nbecause all the suspicious points\ndiscovered so far point to this woman,\nbut he never voiced his suspicions. He\nsimply laid all the doubts out in the\nopen. The reason was that he didn't want\nZhu Yuan Jang and Zu Bao to think that\nhe was deliberately guiding them. After\nall, this is a family matter between the\nemperor and the crown prince, and he, as\nan outsider, doesn't need to make such a\nfuss. Anyway, all the doubts are there\nand it's their own business what they\nthink. But now Zhu Yuan Jang directly\nasked the question and pointed out the\nLu family, leaving Wei Wu somewhat\nhelpless. As if sensing Weii Wu&lt;unk&gt;s\nconcerns, Zhu Yuan Jang smiled and\npatted him on the shoulder. Shiao Wu, I\ncan sense that you have some kind of,\n\"How should I put it? It's like there's\nan invisible barrier between us. I can\nunderstand. After all, I am the emperor\nwho controls life and death.\" As the\nsaying goes, serving a ruler is like\nserving a tiger. Emperors do not open\ntheir hearts to others. But actually, we\nreally want to be honest with you, but\nwe also understand that this can't be\nproven by words alone. It takes time to\nprove it. We don't expect you to be\ncompletely open and honest with us in a\nshort time. So, let's put it another\nway. At this point, Zhu Yuan Jang turned\nto look at Wayi Wu, his eyes filled with\nutmost openness. The world is bustling,\nall for profit. The world is bustling\nall for gain. You are a smart person\nknowing your own value and importance.\nThe common people's benefit is wealth.\nThe officials benefit is power and the\nemperor's benefit is the world.\nTherefore, to us, your importance is far\ngreater than you think. As long as you\ndon't betray the Ming dynasty or us,\neven if you make a mistake, we have to\nadmit it, right? In the end, Zhu Yuan\nJang even made a witty remark to lighten\nthe mood. It must be said that Zu Yuan\nJang&lt;unk&gt;s words were indeed very\nsincere. However, for Wei Wu, a person\nfrom a later generation who had\nexperienced the information explosion,\nthis was not the case. Human nature is\nfickle. There's really no guarantee of\nanything. Trust isn't built on words. A\nperson won't truly open their heart just\nbecause of a few sincere words. Of\ncourse, we also believe that this was\nhis true feeling, at least at this\nmoment. As for the future, no one can\nsay for sure what will happen.\nTherefore, he is willing to show the\nappropriate attitude in order to be\nsincere at this moment. After all, the\nemperor had been so open and honest with\nhim, so he had to give him some face and\ncouldn't refuse him outright. Uncle Zu,\nmy greatest joy in life is having a wife\nand children, a warm bed, and living a\ncomfortable life. So, I assure you that\nI will not betray the Ming dynasty.\nAfter all, you are the emperor. You\nvalue me and you can always protect me.\nBut who knows what the future emperor\nwill be like, so could you please have\nmercy and give me a get out of jail free\ncard or something?\" As he spoke, Wayi Wu\ndeliberately raised his eyebrows in a\nwink. In fact, Chow Chow knew perfectly\nwell that this thing was useless and\nthat the emperor had plenty of reasons\nto kill him. Especially during the Hong\nWu reign, those who possessed imperial\nedicts of merit were executed. In\ncomparison, the iron certificate issued\nby Emperor Zhu Yuan Jang in the Tang\nDynasty had a greater impact than the\none bestowed by Emperor Zhu Yuan Jang.\nAfter all, acknowledging the ironclad\ncertificate of the previous dynasty also\nsignifies that the current dynasty is\nalso the legitimate successor of the\nChinese nation, which is very important.\nBut given the current situation, I have\nto say something. As it turned out, Weii\nWu was right, and Zhu Yuan Jang burst\ninto laughter upon hearing it. You brat,\nfine. I'll have someone specially cast\nan immunity token and issue an imperial\ndecree to bestow it upon you in public.\nNow you have no more worries, right? So,\ncan you answer my question now? Weii Wu\nnodded in satisfaction and then said\ndirectly, I think it was Lady Lu. She\nwas the crown prince's principal wife.\nAfter Xiang Ing passed away, she and her\nson were the biggest beneficiaries. Lady\nLu went from being a concubine to the\nprincipal wife, and naturally her son\nbecame the nominal legitimate heir. As\nlong as Zhu Yun Wan continues to be\nraised into a useless person, no one\nwill be able to compete with her son for\nthe throne. That's exactly what she did,\nwhich is why Zhu Yunwin was able to\nascend the throne and become emperor.\nOtherwise, the emperor should have been\nZu Yunwin. Zhu Yuan Jang remained silent\nfor a while before slowly speaking. Yes,\nthere's only one throne. If she doesn't\nfight for it, her son will never have a\nchance in his lifetime. As he spoke, his\ngaze was fixed on the distance, and he\nseemed lost in thought. After a long\nwhile, Zhu Yuan Jang came to his senses\nand looked at Wayi Wu. Shiao Wu, you\nsaid last time that Yun Wan ascended the\nthrone, but his generation name became\nthe fourth. Why is that? This sudden\nsharp turn almost caused Weii Woo to\nstrain his back. Why did the crown\nprincess Lou suddenly switched the topic\nto Judy when she was talking about the\ncrown princess Louu? But on second\nthought, when it comes to the throne,\nthese two are indeed inextricably\nlinked. After a moment of silence and\nhaving carefully organized his thoughts,\nWei Wu finally spoke. Uncle Zu, even if\nI didn't tell you, you probably already\nguessed the reason. That's right. It's a\npower struggle between uncle and nephew.\nIn the 31st year of Han Wu, Emperor Jang\nWin ascended the throne and established\nthe reign title Jangwin. In August of\nthe following year, the first year of\nJang Win, Emperor Jenang implemented a\npolicy of weakening the power of the\nprinces. Upon hearing the words reducing\nthe power of the princes, Zhu Yuan Jang\nimmediately frowned. When the princes\nwere initially in theft, many ministers\ndid oppose it, fearing a repeat of the\nchaos of the Han and Gene dynasties. Zhu\nYuan Jang also had his own selfish\nmotives. He simply wanted to give his\nson some benefits. In fact, he\nunderstood that reducing the power of\nthe princes was an inevitable policy\nafter the new emperor ascended the\nthrone, which would benefit the\ncentralization of power. Despite this\nconflicting mindset, Zhu Yuan Jang was\nstill influenced by his past hardships\nand chose to infect princes. However,\nsome measures were also taken to prevent\nunforeseen circumstances from arising in\nthe future. For example, princes were\nnot allowed to interfere in the\nadministration of their thiefts, were\nnot permitted to have private dealings,\nand were not allowed to enter the\ncapital without an imperial edict. As\nfor whether future emperors would reduce\nthe power of the regional princes, and\nwhether the regional princes would cause\ntrouble, he was no longer alive then,\nand he couldn't interfere in the affairs\nof his children and grandchildren, even\nif he wanted to. It was a bit of\nselfishness on his part. Zhu Yuan Jang\nnever expected that Zhu Yun Wan would be\nso unwise, impatiently reducing the\npower of the princes just one year after\nascending the throne. Even a year is not\nenough time for the imperial court to\nmaintain stability. So reducing the\npower of the princes at this point would\nnot be a wise move. After a moment of\nsilence, Zhu Yuan Jang sides softly and\nasked again. The fourth prince must have\nbeen pushed too far during the campaign\nto reduce the power of the princes,\nwhich is why he chose to rebel and seize\nthe throne. Right? Yes. It was carried\nout under the pretext of purging the\ncourt of corrupt officials and is\nhistorically known as the Jingan\ncampaign. We acknowledge that the fourth\nprince is indeed talented, but even with\ntalent, it would be incredibly difficult\nfor him to seize power. How did he\nmanage to do it? It must be said that\nJuda's vision and political acumen were\ntruly remarkable. Zhu D was indeed a man\nof great talent and ambition, but the\nJing campaign was still extremely\ndifficult and he almost died several\ntimes. Thinking back on what had\nhappened, Wayi Wu couldn't help but\nchuckle to himself and then said,\n\"Personal ability is one aspect, but the\nmain reason is the contrast with the\nenemy. Otherwise, the Jingn rebellion\nwould not have succeeded with the\nstrength of the Ming dynasty. Although\nthere are some obstacles to reducing the\npower of the princes, it is not\ndifficult to succeed. It's just that\nEmperor Jangwin is too inexperienced. In\naddition, the people around him who gave\nhim advice were all useless scholars who\nonly knew how to talk about strategy on\npaper and they made one bad move after\nanother. And at the crucial moment, the\nsecond war god of the Ming dynasty\ndefected, which allowed Emperor Yungla\nto succeed in suppressing the rebellion.\nThe second war god of the Ming dynasty.\nUpon hearing this title, Zhu Yuan Jang\ncouldn't help but wonder who this god of\nwar was. Chapter 342. War gods of the\nMing dynasty enraged Zhu Yuan Jang. Xiao\nWu. Who is this second war god of the\nMing dynasty you mentioned? Where his\nglorious achievements? Forehead. Wayi Wu\nwas actually in a bit of a daze just\nnow, so he casually used a nickname that\nwould later be used to tease people. Now\nthat Zhu Yuan Jang has specifically\nasked him about this, he doesn't know\nwhat to say. Seeing Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s\nhesitant appearance, Zhu Yuan Jang was\nno fool and immediately understood. Shia\nWu, this so-called second war god of the\nMing dynasty you mentioned, probably\ndoesn't have a good reputation. Om. Wayi\nWu nodded. Tell me, we also want to know\nwho this second war god of the Ming\ndynasty is and what glorious\nachievements he has made. Since Xu Yuan\nJang had said so, Wayi Wu no longer\nhesitated and immediately began to\nspeak. Lie Jing Long, son of the Duke of\nCiao, was famous for his three major\nbattles and was jokingly called the\nsecond war god of the Ming dynasty by\nlater generations. In the first battle,\nthe Battle of Bigo River, he led an army\nof 500,000 against the tens of thousands\nof troops of Princen Zudi and suffered\nheavy losses and returned to defeat. The\nsecond battle was also at the Bgo River.\nLie Jing Long led an army of 600,000\nagainst Zhu Di's 100,000. He was\ndefeated again and abandoned his baggage\nand retreated to Jinon. In the third\nbattle, he led his troops to guard the\ngates of Nanjing. When Zudi's army was\nat the city gates, he took the\ninitiative to open the gates and\nsurrender, welcoming the prince of Yen\ninto the city. Zhu Yuan Jang never\nexpected that the second greatest war\ngod of the Ming dynasty would be that\nlittle fellow Li Jing Long because Lie\nJing Long was handsome from a young age\nand well-versed in historical records\nand anecdotes. Zhu Yuan Jong actually\nliked him quite a bit. He was just a\n13-year-old kid at the time, but he\nnever expected to achieve such a\nbrilliant record later on. W Jang's\noffspring is so incompetent. It seems we\nneed to be careful in the future and not\nlet this little rascal take command of\nthe army. Zhu Yuan Jang casually made a\nsarcastic remark and then presented wei\nWu with a difficult problem. Since\nyou've already mentioned the second war\ngod, then let's not hide the first war\ngod of the Ming dynasty anymore. Tell\nus. Upon hearing this, we wu couldn't\nhelp but inwardly complain. Okay, if you\nhadn't said that, I would have just said\nthat I was the greatest war god of the\nMing dynasty. Anyway, I've already\nmentioned it before, but since you said\nthat first, how am I supposed to respond\nto what you're saying next? Why don't\nyou teach me? Looking at Juu Yu and\nJangs still somewhat smiling face, Wu\nthought for a moment and decided it was\nbest not to provoke him. Uncle Zu, the\nso-called number one war god of the Ming\ndynasty is actually just so let's not\ntalk about it. Upon hearing this, the\nsmile on Ju Yuan Jangs face vanished\ninstantly. Speak. I want to hear it.\nWhich unfil descendant is it? Okay, this\nis what you told me to say. Don't blame\nme if he gets so angry that your blood\nvessels burst. Seeing Zhu&lt;unk&gt;s gritted\nteeth, Wayi Wu knew he couldn't escape.\nI simply said it openly and honestly.\nThat was Emperor Inzong of Ming Zhu\nChiian who was captured alive by the\nOurit Mongols in the battle of Tamu\nFortress and taken away by them. He was\nlater known as the Ourit student. He was\nimprisoned in Bayante's territory for\nmore than a year. When a Ming dynasty\nestablished a new emperor, the Urit\nreleased him. The Ourit Mongols once\ntook him to Schwan Fu and Daong,\ndemanding that the garrison opened the\ncity gates. But Zhu Xiin did not order\nhis soldiers to do so. It is only\nbecause of his previous achievements,\ncoupled with the fact that he executed\nYuchi, the junior protector of state,\nwho is saving the dynasty from collapse,\nupon returning to the capital, that he\nis despised by later generations. So,\nthey fabricated the story of his\nkidnapping, which led to his titles of\nthe great Ming's first war god and the\ngatekeeper emperor. Was Xu Yuan Jang\nangry? Yes. Upon hearing the glorious\ndeeds of Emperor Zhu Xiin of the Ming\ndynasty again, Zhu Yuan Jang was so\nangry he felt like his lungs were about\nto explode. The veins on his forehead\nthrobbed like earthworms and his\nclenched fist trembled uncontrollably.\nThe dignified emperor of the Ming\ndynasty was captured and not only did he\nnot die, but he was also given the\nnickname the gatekeeper emperor.\nRegardless of whether he actually called\nher doorman or not, this form of address\nremains an indelible stain on the Ming\ndynasty. To be honest, if Zhu Xiin were\nstanding here now, Zhu Yuan Jang would\ndraw his sword and kill this unfil\ndescendant. All right, don't mention\nthat bastard again. I don't want to hear\nhis name again. Son of Upon\nhearing these three words, Wayi Wu\nalmost couldn't help but burst out\nlaughing. If Zhu Chiian was a bastard,\nthen what are you, old man? Isn't this\njust a way of insulting yourself?\nHowever, it's clear that Zhu Yuan Jang\nwas genuinely angered and Wayi Wu\nwouldn't idly invite trouble. At this\nmoment, Zhu Yuan Jang spoke again. Let's\ntalk about the fourth brother. I won't\ngo into the details as what is recorded\nin history books may not be true. Let's\njust talk about his achievements and\naccomplishments. There are too many\nachievements and accomplishments to list\nin just a few words. Weii Wu took a deep\nbreath, carefully considering his words\nbefore speaking. Throughout history, the\nYonga Emperor's achievements in both\ncivil administration and military\naffairs rank him among the top 10\nemperors. In terms of civil\nadministration, he may be above average,\nbut in terms of martial arts, he is\nprobably comparable to you. And many\npeople in later generations even believe\nthat he surpasses you. Zu Yuan\nJang&lt;unk&gt;s eyes lit up. He was the\nfounding emperor. Yet his fourth son's\nmartial arts skills surpassed his own.\nJust as I was getting curious, I heard\nwe woo continue speaking. Emperor Yong\nlaunched five expeditions to the\nnorthern deserts deterring the Mongols\nand later the from advancing south. He\nalso conquered Anam and incorporated it\ninto the territory of the Ming dynasty.\nExpanding the territory to Liaong, the\nNurgan regional military commission was\nestablished. The Mandian were conquered.\nThe Yusang were subdued, the Grand Canal\nwas dredged, and the Yungla encyclopedia\nwas compiled. Historically, there have\nbeen five people who sealed the Wolf's\nLair, four of whom were military\nofficers and generals, and only one of\nthem was an emperor, namely the Yongla\nEmperor. Although he knew that his\nfourth son had usurped the throne, Zhu\nwas still satisfied to hear of his son's\nachievements. After all, the user\npatient of the throne had not yet\noccurred. So there was no reason for her\nto be angry with Zui. Moreover, his\neldest son is still alive and Wei Wu is\nalso here. So Zhu Bao will not die young\ndue to illness. After all, Zhu Bao did\nnot die of smallpox. There was a cure.\nIt's just that the thought of smallpox\nreminded him of Zhu Xiang. Then I\nthought of Xu Yun followed by Zhu and\nthen Zuds descendants. He couldn't help\nbut want to strangle his son Juudi. Just\nas Xu Yuan Jang was struggling with the\ndecision regarding Zhu, Weii Wu spoke up\nagain. However, what I personally\nrespect most about Emperor Yonga is his\nopening up of the seas, ordering Jean Hi\nto make six voyages to explore the\nwestern ocean. Wherever our Ming dynasty\ntreasure ships pass, foreign tribes and\nbarbarian lands are all aruck by the\nstrength of the Ming dynasty and envious\nof its prosperity. It not only greatly\npromoted the prestige of our great Ming\ndynasty, but also facilitated exchanges\nwith other countries, promoted trade,\nand boosted the economy. At the\nbeginning of his reign, Zhu Yuan Jang\nordered a ban on maritime trade and even\nabolish the maritime trade office.\nHowever, the main reason is that the\ncountry was newly established,\ninternally unstable, and its foundation\nwas not solid. Furthermore, with the\ndeath of both the grandson and the crown\nprince in the later period and the\nemperor busy helping Zhu Yunwin\nconsolidate his throne, the issue of the\nsea was no longer taken seriously.\nHowever, hearing Wu say this now. He\nbecame somewhat curious about the\nsituation overseas. Zhu Yuan Jang from\nthe perspective of an emperor was very\nclear about the situation, having sent\nenvoys to the Western Ocean six times.\nIf there were no benefits to doing this,\nno one would bother to go six times,\nwhich would be time-consuming,\nlaborious, and expensive. Shia Wu, what\nare the benefits of going overseas that\nwould make fourth brother go to sea six\ntimes at such a huge cost? Wayi Wu\nchuckled inwardly, thinking, \"It was\nworth it for me to bring up overseas.\"\nOldju finally got to the point. Chapter\n35. It's time to bring out the world\nmap. Indeed, Chow Chow deliberately\nmentioned Jang. his voyages to the\nwestern ocean in order to attract Zhu\nYuan Jang&lt;unk&gt;s attention. This would\nallow Zhu Yuan Jang to focus his\nattention overseas, thereby lifting the\nmaritime ban with such abundant benefits\nfrom the age of exploration. How could\nthe Ming dynasty be left out? Uncle Zu,\nI once said that the Japanese pirates\npossessed a large number of gold and\nsilver mines, but there are also\nabundant mineral and land resources\noverseas. gold, silver, copper, iron,\nand other metal ores, abundant species\nresources, and in some places the land\ncan even yield three harvests a year.\nPutting everything else aside, the fact\nthat there were three harvests in one\nyear alone made Ju Yu and Jang's eyes\nlight up. Just then, Wayi Wu suddenly\npulled out a world map. Uncle Zu, I told\nyou before that the world is a giant\nsphere. Do you remember? In fact, our\nEarth is a water planet with 70% of its\ntotal surface area being ocean and only\n30% being land. This is a world map\ndrawn in later times. The red area is\nthe territory of China in later times\nand the blue area is all sea. As we woo\nspoke, he spread the map out on the\nground to show it to the world. He then\npointed out Hishakari town in Kagoshima\nPrefecture and Oda city in Sherain\nPrefecture on the map. This is the\nlocation of the Japanese gold mine and\nthe Awami silver mine. Looking at the\nworld map in Weii Wu&lt;unk&gt;s hand. Zhu\nYuan Jang was truly amazed. It turns out\nthe world is so big. The territory of\nthe Ming dynasty was less than onetenth\nof that. What shocked them even more was\nthe ocean. The endless sea was so much\nlarger than the land. At this moment, he\ntruly understood what it meant to be a\ndrop in the ocean. Then we wu continued,\n\"Your majesty, throughout history, China\nhas always been a leading nation in the\nworld. But then we were surpassed by the\nWestern barbarians, and even hundreds of\nyears later, the Western powers forced\nopen our doors, bringing a century of\nhumiliation. At this point, Wayi Wu gave\nZhu Yuan Jang a brief explanation of the\nGregorian calendar before continuing.\nThe period from 1400 to 1699 is known to\nlater generations as the age of\nexploration during which countries\naround the world exchanged ideas,\ndeveloped and progressed through the\nocean. But the Ming dynasty only opened\nup the sea during the reign of Emperor\nYongwa. Emperor Renzong Zhu Gauchi\nreigned for less than a year followed by\nEmperor Schwanzong Zhuani. But in the\neighth year of the Schwanda reign, Zhu\nJanji once again banned the sea and the\nban was more stringent than ever before.\nAfter closing itself off from the world,\nthe Ming dynasty became isolated from\nthe world and China was caught up and\nsurpassed by the West, starting from the\nage of exploration. After we wu finished\nspeaking, Zhu Yuan Jang frowned and fell\nin a deep thought, and no one knew what\nhe was thinking. A moment later, he\npointed to the location of what would\nlater become South Korea. This place is\nso close to the Japanese pirates,\nseparated only by a straight. Wouldn't\nit be more convenient to cross the sea\nfrom here? Upon hearing this, Wayi Wu\nimmediately explained, \"This place is\nnow called Gorio.\" In the 25th year of\nHong Wu, Isong Jiu overthrew Gorio and\nestablished himself as king. I request\nthat you bestow a name upon it, after\nwhich it will be called Josian. This\nstrait is 600 lee away from the Japanese\npirates at its farthest point and only\n300 lee away at its closest point,\nmaking it much more convenient to land\non the island. Weii wouldn't know why\nZhu Yuan Jang asked that question, but\nhe was certain it wasn't about sending\ntroops. After all, even a vassal state\nwould not allow the Ming army to openly\npass through its territory. No one can\nguarantee that this army won't turn\naround and attack them. In fact, Zhu\nYuan Jang did not send troops out of\nnecessity, but had other purposes. Xiao\nWu, the matter of the Japanese pirates\nis not urgent for now. We are still\nfighting in the southwest. Although the\nsituation is good, it is not advisable\nto fight on two fronts. We will discuss\nthe matter of the Japanese pirates after\nthe southwestern campaign is over and\nthe troops return to the capital. Before\nthat, we would like to send someone to\nthe Japanese pirates first. Firstly, we\nneed to investigate the situation to\nunderstand ourselves and our enemy.\nSecondly, we need to find the exact\nlocation of the gold and silver mines to\nmake full preparations for future\nexpeditions. Upon hearing this, Wayi Wu\nimmediately responded, \"Uncle Zu, you\nknow better than me how to handle\nimportant national affairs. You can make\nthe decision on this matter. I only want\nthem to die, even if it means the\ndestruction of the country and the\nextinction of the race. But I know this\nis no small matter. The more\npreparations we make, the fewer\ncasualties our Ming soldiers will\nsuffer. And before that, I need to\nfigure out if I could develop a steam\nengine. Then the seas will belong to the\nMing dynasty. Upon hearing a new term,\nZhu Yuan Jang immediately grasped its\nkey point. Shiao Wu, what is this\nstriving chicken you mentioned, and what\nis its purpose? The steam engine is a\nvery powerful machine that can replace\nlivestock and human power, making\nvehicles and ships move on their own.\nUpon hearing this, Zhu Yuan Jang\nrealized he had made a mistake. It\nwasn't the chicken, but the machine, but\nthen he continued to ask, \"How is it\npossible to move vehicles and boats\nwithout using livestock or human labor?\"\nWayi Wu thought for a moment and then\ngave a description that Zhu Yuan Jang\ncould understand. Uncle Zu, have you\never seen a kettle boiling water?\nDoesn't the lid get pushed up by the\nboiling steam? The steam engine uses\nthis principle to convert steam into\ndriving force by burning coal or wood.\nIt's just that the process is a bit\ncomplicated, and I'm not sure if I can\nactually build it. Wayiw's statement was\nnot unfounded. He genuinely possessed\nblueprints related to steam engines.\nMoreover, it was a blueprint for a\nreciprocating steam engine. After all,\nhe was a time traveler with a system, so\nhe didn't need to go through the\ndevelopment process again. However, some\ncomponents of a steam engine have\nrequirements for the quality of the\nsteel. So, steel must be smelted first\nin order to manufacture it. Steel making\nrequires blast furnaces, which in turn\nrequire refractory bricks. And to get\nall that sorted out, steam engine\ncomponents had to be cast. Wayiu was\njust an ordinary person in the past. He\nknew these things, but that didn't mean\nhe could create them. At this point,\nWayi Wu couldn't help but complain about\nthe system in his mind. The couer\ndelivered so many things, mostly things\nfor eating, drinking, having fun, and\nenjoying life. Am I Wei Woo, such a\nshallow person? That's true, but system,\nyou can't be so unambitious. Why didn't\nyou send me the three great books on\ntime travel? As Weii Wu was inwardly\nranting, he heard Zhu Yu and Jan&lt;unk&gt;s\nquestion. Xiao Wu is the steam engine\nalso considered technology. Can a Ming\ndynasty develop in the direction of\ntechnology? Wayi Wu is not at all\nsurprised that Zhu Yuan Jang wanted to\ndevelop science and technology. Once\nyou've witnessed the power of\ntechnology, no one can resist its charm.\nSo after Zu Yuan Jang finished speaking,\nhe immediately replied, \"Yes, but we\nneed to promote educational reform and\nmake mathematics an important subject\nbecause it is the foundation of science\nand technology. It's best to start with\nchildren. Technology isn't something\nthat can be achieved overnight. It's the\nresult of generations of people\naccumulating knowledge.\" Zhu Yuan Jang\nnodded, then looked at Wayi Wu again.\nXiao Wu, you're the only one in the\nentire Ming dynasty who understands\ntechnology, so we want to entrust this\nmatter to you. Upon hearing Zhu Yuan\nJ&lt;unk&gt;s words, Wayi Wu fell silent on\nthe spot. During this period, he only\ngave orders verbally. How to implement\nthem was Zu Yuan Jang&lt;unk&gt;s problem. He\nwas self-aware and did not believe that\na modern person could dictate the course\nof history by going to ancient times.\nBut the task that Ju Yuan Jang is\ntalking about now is something that only\nhe, a modern person, can truly\naccomplish. The reason for my silence\nis, as I said before, that I don't want\nto get involved in official. It's too\ntroublesome. Zhu Yuan Jang understood\nhis concerns and patted him on the\nshoulder. Continuing, I know you don't\nwant to get involved in official, so you\nmight as well think about whether there\nare any solutions in the future. Chapter\n36. Royal Academy of Sciences. After Zu\nYuan Jang finished speaking, he focused\nhis attention on the world map while we\nWoo fell into deep thought. What's the\nsolution? That makes sense. For example,\nresearch institutes only accept funding\nand are only responsible for research.\nWhat researchers do with the results of\ntheir research is not something they\nneed to worry about. If a department\nwere established using this model, the\nemperor would provide research funding.\nIf one is only responsible for studying\nand researching and only reports to the\nemperor, then one will not get entangled\nin official. Once the research is\ncompleted and the product is patented by\nthe emperor, how is operated is his\nbusiness. As for whether this model will\nhave drawbacks in the future or whether\nit will cause any bad results. We wu\nsaid it had nothing to do with him. He\nmight have already kicked the bucket by\nthen. There is no perfect system in this\nworld. What the future holds will be\nborn and resolved by the people of that\nfuture. In short, all we need to do is\nsew the seeds of science and let them\ntake root and sprout in this land. What\nChow Chow needed to ensure was that\nduring his lifetime, he could make the\nMing dynasty dominate the world and\nsweep across all nations. We must ensure\nthat this time is China that uses guns\nand cannons to blast open the doors of\nother countries. What we want is a\nbattle where we dominate the weaker\nopponents due to a technological\nadvantage. Instead of closing itself off\nfrom the world like a certain dynasty,\nwhich eventually had its doors blasted\nopen by foreign cannons. Having figured\nthis out, Wayi Wu directly expressed his\nthoughts. Zhu Yuan Jang was very\nsatisfied after hearing this. The\nImperial Academy of Science and\nTechnology of the Ming Dynasty. Great\nidea. I think it's excellent for Zhu\nYuan Jang. Whether he was satisfied or\nnot was not important. He was satisfied\nas long as Wayi Wu was willing to take\non the responsibility. The biggest\nchallenge in science and technology is\nnot knowing how to begin. But Wayi Wu\nwas able to solve this problem. So after\nacknowledging Weii Wu&lt;unk&gt;s idea, he\nimmediately asked another question. Do\nyou have any ideas on how to proceed\nspecifically? Wei Wu nodded and said,\n\"We can first gather a group of adults,\npreferably craftsmen, since those who\nare technical and those who are\nscientific, have a lot in common. We\njust need to break their preconceived\nnotions about the world, make them more\nopen to new things and cultivate them\ninto pioneers. If we unite to establish\na school of thought and produce some\nresults that benefit the country and the\npeople, it can develop in a positive\ndirection once it becomes an established\nsystem. These things sound simple, but\nthey're actually not difficult at all in\npractice. There is no shortage of\nintelligent and talented people in any\nera. What is lacking is cognition and\nbasic knowledge. Gather these people\ntogether. Then categorize them according\nto their strengths and interests and\nteach them the basics. Then assign them\na project and let them use the knowledge\nthey have learned to practice, think and\ncreate. The biggest challenge here is\ntime. New knowledge needs time to be\ndigested and absorbed. Projects also\nneed time to gradually transform into\nresults. However, anyone with a strong\ninterest in science will find learning\nmuch more effective. Wayi Woo himself\ndid not need to do research. He only\nneeded to guide the research in the\nright direction. What's that saying\nagain? A leader doesn't need to be\nhighly capable as long as they know how\nto use capable people. Wayi Wu&lt;unk&gt;s\nwords were simple and easy to\nunderstand. Even Zhu Yuan Jang, an\nancient figure, could comprehend them.\nAlthough he didn't understand the\ndetails of how it worked. He was an\ninvestor and only cared about the\nresults, not the process. Since the\nImperial Science and Technology Research\nInstitute of the Great Ming dynasty is\nonly responsible to the emperor, let the\nnecessary funds be paid from our\nimperial treasury. Uncle Zu, you can\nmake the decision on this, but the\npersonnel and location need to be\narranged in advance. Zu Yuan Jang nodded\nand immediately agreed. Don't worry,\nwe'll have the Ministry of Works help\nyou select people. In addition, the\nAcademy of Sciences will also make\npreparations. Whether you want them\ninside or outside the city, let's go\noutside the city. There are too many\npeople inside the city, and some things\nwill be very inconvenient. With the\nmatter of the Imperial Academy of\nScience and Technology of the Ming\nDynasty settled, Wayiu was already\nthinking about taking his leave and\ngoing home. It's getting late and if we\nkeep chatting it might get light before\ndawn. Zhu Yuan Jang was preoccupied with\nthoughts of Zhu Xanging and Empress Ma\nso he must have had trouble sleeping but\nhe was incredibly tired. However, just\nas way Wu was about to speak a voice\nsuddenly came from outside the hall.\nYour subject Maang requests an audience\nwith your majesty Kain. Upon receiving\nZhu Yuan Jang&lt;unk&gt;s order, Maang\nhurriedly pushed open the door and\nentered. As soon as he entered, he saw\nWei Wu and the emperor sitting together\non the steps. Although he was shocked by\nZhu Yuan Jang&lt;unk&gt;s favor towards Weii\nWu, he showed no expression on his face.\nUpon entering the main hall, Maang first\nclosed the doors tightly before\napproaching Zhu Yuan Jang. Seeing this,\nwe wu quickly moved aside, and sure\nenough, Maang knelt down as soon as he\nleft. Your majesty, as per your decree,\nI have discovered some things that I\nwish to report to you. Maang only went\nthis far and did not continue speaking.\nWe wu understood that this was because\nhe was there. So, he prepared to take\nthis opportunity to say goodbye to Zhu.\nHowever, before he could speak, Zhu Yuan\nJang spoke first. There's no need to\navoid Wu to speak your mind. Yes. Maang\nresponded respectfully and then\ncontinued. After a thorough\ninvestigation, I have found that among\nall those who had contact with the crown\nprince, some had indeed left the palace.\nShe is a palace maiden named Chui. She\nis the crown princess's personal maid\nand recently left the palace to attend a\nfuneral in her family. However, after\ncareful inquiry, I learned that Chuni\nleft the palace because the crown\nprincess took pity on her father's\npassing and granted her permission to\nleave the palace for one day. Maang\npaused for a moment after speaking\nbefore continuing regarding those\ninfected with smallox. I have sent\npeople to inquire at all the medical\nclinics and funeral supply shops in the\ncapital. We haven't encountered anyone\ninfected with smallox recently. There's\nonly one person in the entire capital\nand he's in the Ginu's prison. I\noriginally intended to use him to verify\nthe smallox vaccination, but since\nsmallox vaccination has not yet been\nverified, I dare not torture him.\nHowever, I have checked his travel\npermit. This man is here to deliver\ngoods to a rice shop and has been in the\ncapital for some time. We haven't yet\nfound out whether Chui has had any\ncontact with this person. Wayi Wu\nlistened from the side and sighed\ninwardly. We found some things on both\nsides, but they were all trivial. If\nit's impossible to even connect the two\nsides, then the survey results are not\nvery useful. Zhu Yuan Jang is probably\ngoing to start yelling at me now. We Wu\nthought to himself and decided to speak\nup directly. Uncle Zu, it's getting late\nand I'm really sleepy. Why don't I go\nback to sleep first? Zu Yuan Jang sighed\nand laughed. Why are you so lazy, kid?\nGo back and rest. All right. In\nresponse, Wayi Wu turned and left Fumian\nHall without saying another word.\nWatching Wayi Wu&lt;unk&gt;s departing figure,\nZhu Yuan Jang sighed softly. This kid is\nstill keeping his distance. Trust really\ncan't be built in just a few words.\nLet's give it time. Zhu Yuan Jang\nmuttered something to himself, then\nturned to look at Maang. Continued to\ninvestigate whether there was any\ncontact between the two. No clue should\nbe overlooked. Also, since I want to\nkeep an eye on the crown prince, if you\ndo give that boy Xiang in a proper\nsendoff, as he spoke, another name came\nto mind. Zhu Yunwin, chapter 37, Wayi\nWu, I solemnly swear to formally join\nthe wind spirit moon shadow sect. To Zhu\nYuan Jang, the crown princess Lu was\nnothing more than a crown princess. If\nit was Lady Chong, Zhu Bao&lt;unk&gt;s first\nwife and the daughter of his own old\nbrother, Zhu Yuan Jang would have to\ntake her seriously. Lady Lu was merely a\nconcubine who had been promoted to the\nposition of principal wife. Her death\ndid not cause Zhu Yuan Jang the\nslightest emotional fluctuation. Only\nZhu Yunwin made it difficult for him to\nchoose. After all, he was a descendant\nof the Zhu family. But after hesitating\nfor a while, Zhu Yuan Jang made a\ndecision in his heart. Yinwin, don't\nblame your grandfather for being\nheartless. Blame your mother for her\nsins. The story of Zhu Xiang Ing\ncontracting smallpox. If Chow Chow\nhadn't appeared, it would probably have\nbeen treated as a random event and\nhandled normally. But now the answer is\nobvious. Someone is manipulating all of\nthis behind the scenes. If it was really\nLou who did it, then she deserves to\ndie. If not, she has no reason to live.\nThe reason is simple. While Zhu\nXiongying was alive, the Lu family had\nno chance whatsoever. But Zhu Xianging\ndied. And even if the Louu family\noriginally had no ambition, it would\ngive rise to ambition because of it.\nBecause after Zu Xiongying&lt;unk&gt;s death,\nthe biggest beneficiaries were Lady Lu\nand her son Zhu Yunwin. The only\nobstacle left is Zhu Yunwin. She cannot\nbe killed again. Otherwise, it will\ndefinitely arouse suspicion, but as a\nmother, she can educate her children.\nAfter Zhu Yuan Jang abolished the prime\nminister system, a large number of state\naffairs fell on the emperor's shoulders.\nZhu Bao often handled state affairs with\nZhu Yuan Jang. So the discipline of his\nchildren was naturally left to Lady Lu.\nIf it really comes to that, it would be\ntantamount to repeating the history that\nXiao Chow described. Therefore, Zhu Yuan\nJang had several plans in mind. Firstly,\nit was based on the fact that his\nbeloved grandson, Zhu Xionging, could\nnot withstand the dreaded smallox\ndisease and eventually passed away.\nTherefore, Lady Lu must die. If there is\nevidence, she must die immediately. If\nthere is no evidence, she must die by\naccident. But Lady Lu was not only the\ncrown princess, but also a member of the\nLu clan, a gentry family in Jiang Nan.\nTherefore, Zhu Yianwin also had to\ndisappear after Lady Lu's death so that\nall those who had ulterior motives\nbehind him would give up. At the same\ntime, Zhu Bao was asked to establish\nanother concubine and have as many sons\nas possible to ensure the stability of\nthe state. During this period, he\npersonally mentored Zhu Yun Wan, and so\nfar, Zhu Yunwin has only shown some\nnegative changes. With careful\nadjustments, it's still possible to\ncorrect it. The other arrangement was\nbased on the assumption that Zhu Xiang\nIng survived smallox. So, we should just\nkill the Lu family and release Zhu Yun W\nto his thief ahead of schedule. Even\nthough doing so would be against the\nrules. But in the Ming dynasty, Zhu Yuan\nJong&lt;unk&gt;s rules were the rules. Zhu\nYunwin has already been proven by Chow\nChowo to be completely unfit to be a\nwise ruler. There's no need to place any\nhope in him. Everything should be\nprioritized for the sake of the Ming\ndynasty. Function Hall. Upon receiving\nZhu Yuan Jangs order, Maang immediately\nleft the palace to carry out his duties.\nZhu Yuan Jang also returned to his\npalace to rest. That night, not only Zhu\nYuan Jong didn't sleep well, but many\nothers did, too. Of course, this\nexcludes Wei Wu, who is heartless and\ncarefree. As soon as he got home, he\ncollapsed onto the bed and fell asleep,\nsleeping soundly. He even had a\nbeautiful dream in which he was in a\nvery dimly lit place. He couldn't see\nthe specifics, only remembering that in\nhis dream, he could have whatever he\nwanted. Then the scene changes to him\neating abalone. The fresh, juicy abalone\nis so delicious. He didn't get out of\nbed until 2 p.m. the next day,\nstretching and yawning. Because he\nwasn't used to having someone else dress\nhim, he didn't call the maid in. I was\nthinking of doing something fun today\nsince I'll be busy once the Academy of\nSciences is established. As soon as he\ncame out of the house, he saw Zhu\nYushwan sitting on the sofa playing\nblacksmith. Wayiu had mentioned it to\nXuyu Schwan because he noticed she was\nquite interested in the PS5. He can play\nthe PS5 whenever he's not home or\nsleeping as long as he doesn't break\nanything. Anyway, the other four girls\nwere just curious about this thing, but\nnot very interested. I never expected to\nsee Zhu Yuswan relentlessly battling\nblacksmith as soon as I got up. Upon\ncloser inspection, this girl had\nactually managed to defeat the yellow\nwind great sage. Just as Weii Wu was\nstill reeling from the shock, Zhuan also\nsaw him. He immediately put down the\ncontroller and went to Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s\nside. Young master, you're awake. Are\nyou hungry? I'll go find the cook to get\nyou something to eat. We Wu glanced at\nthe desperate situation and coughed\ntwice. No need. I just woke up and don't\nhave much of an appetite. Then, let me\nbring you some water to wash up. You\ndrooled a lot while you were sleeping.\nHuh? A cough. Cough. Maybe it's because\nof a dream. I dreamt that I was eating\ndelicious food. When Weii Wu spoke, his\neyes darted around and he never dared to\nlook Zhu Yuwan in the eye. However, he\nquickly composed himself. \"Okay, bring\nme some water.\" Then, with Zhu\nYuan&lt;unk&gt;s help, Wei Wu washed his face\nand then brushed his teeth carefully.\nAfter washing up, Wayi Wu wondered if he\nshould play some games to pass the time.\nZhu Yuswan grabbed his sleeve and\npointed towards the screen. Young\nmaster, look, I've defeated this yellow\nwind great sage, but it's so powerful.\nI've been killed by it several times\nalready. Zu Yushuan pouts when she\nspeaks, making her look extremely cute.\nHowever, while admiring the scene, Wayi\nWu was inwardly roaring with rage. What\ndo you mean? Huh? What exactly do you\nmean by this, girl? Are you showing off?\nAre you trying to show off to your young\nmaster? I've developed a deep rivalry\nwith Big Head and now you're telling me\nyou've started cultivating a rivalry\nwith Yellow Wind Great Sage. Are you\nlooking down on me? Are you trying to\nforce me? Are you never going to stop?\nLooks like you really want to fight me.\nFine, if your young master doesn't show\nhis true skills. You really think I'm a\npushover? Luckily, I still have a trick\non my sleeve. Do you have the strength\nto fight me? Weii Wu. Looking at Ju\nYuwan&lt;unk&gt;s pretty face, Weii Wu let out\na low sound. Yusen, things have come to\nthis point, it seems that your young\nmaster has no choice but to reveal his\nidentity to you. I, Wayi Wu, hereby\nformally announced that I will join the\nlargest sect in the gaming world and\nbecome a member of the Wind Spirit Moon\nShadow Sect. After saying that, Wayi Wu\nwent straight to the sofa, picked up the\nhandle, and started operating it. Then\nthe game screen went black and then lit\nup again and Wayi Woos lips curled into\na smile. TrueQi locked. Health locked.\nResistance lock. Unlock the limits on\ndamage, defense, and durability. Unlock\nall skills. Eliminate skill cooldowns.\nPower. I feel an endless surge of power\nrising within me. After his complete\ntransformation, a fierce fighting spirit\nignited in Wayi Wu's eyes. You Shien,\njust you wait. I'll show you what a true\ninvincible master is. As Wayi Wu spoke,\nthe monkey on the screen had already\napproached the great sage yellow wind\nwith a stick. Chapter 38. Dark clouds\nover the palace. Smallox cure arrives.\nThe wind and moon shadows are ruthless\nin their attacks. Surrounded by a\nhundred or so monkeys. The great sage\nyellow wind was like a pitiful little\nquail. Weii Wu standing to the side\ndemonstrated what smooth, fluid movement\nand miraculous dodging truly meant. 5\nminutes later, the great sage yellow\nwind finally died under the hail of\nclubs. Great sage yellow wind hump, your\nfall only proves that you are nothing\nmore than a monster. Young master,\nyou're amazing. Seeing Hang Fong dashing\neasily defeated by Wei Wu, Xu Yuan stood\nby with eyes full of admiration and\nsaid, \"This worship allowed Weii Wu to\nregain the dignity of his lord and his\nheart was greatly satisfied.\" Just as he\nwas feeling a little smug, Zhu Yuwan\nspoke up again. \"Young master, why can\nyou summon so many monkeys while I can\nonly summon so few and have to wait a\nlong time?\" This cough cough, this is of\ncourse the power bestowed upon me by the\nsect. a power that only disciples of the\nwind spirit moon shadow sect possess.\nUpon hearing this, Zhu Yuswan\nimmediately looked at Weii Wu with\nanticipation. Then, may I join the wind\nspirit moon shadow sect? Just kidding.\nThis is the only skill I have to hold my\nown. If you learn it, how will I\nsurvive? Weii Wu thought to himself, but\nsaid it tactfully. The wind spirit moon\nshadow sect can only be joined by people\nwith extremely strong minds and wills.\nThe basic requirement is to be unafraid\nof worldly opinions and to be able to\nsmile slightly in the face of criticism\nfrom thousands. Upon hearing this,\nZhuwan's face immediately showed a\ndisappointed expression. That's so\ndifficult. Weii Wu chuckled inwardly but\ndidn't say anything more about the\nmatter, mainly because there was no way\nto explain it. You can't exactly say you\ndon't compare yourself to the young\nmaster. The young master is not only\ncheating in life, but also in games. In\nfact, Wayi Wu already knew that the\nversion of Black Myth he was playing was\na hacked version. Even when he was being\nbrutally defeated by the boss, he didn't\nactivate win spirit moon shadow since\nactivating it would mean a speedrun.\nThis is the Ming Dynasty. Once you've\nactually cleared the game, there'll be\nnothing left to pass the time.\nFortunately, it's no longer necessary.\nSince it's already started, let's just\nhave some fun crushing the noobs. Now,\npeople use cheats to easily defeat\nmonsters in games. In the future, they\nwill use cheats to easily defeat the\nentire world. With Juywan by his side,\nWayi Wu was completely immersed in the\njoy of the game. They played from a\nmoment they woke up until nightfall,\nonly putting down the controller when\nthe monkey put on the golden headband.\nTurning around, I found that Ju Yuswan\nhad fallen asleep with her head resting\non my shoulder. Her cherry-like lips\nwere just inches away, and the faint\nfragrance of orchids wafted into my\nnostrils. So, here's the question.\nShould we take this opportunity to\nsample its fragrance? Taking advantage\nof someone's unpreparedness is not the\nact of a true hero. Thinking to himself,\nWayi Wu looked at Zu Yushwan again, her\nbright red lips coming into view. But\nthen again, what kind of hero am I? A\nmere scoundrel. Thinking of this, Wayiu\nno longer hesitated and slowly lowered\nhis head as he looked at Juyu Schwan.\nGuys who kiss often know that it's\nimpossible to kiss on the lips from this\nangle. Therefore, Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s actions\nwere inevitably a bit too much to the\npoint that Zhu Yusuan showed signs of\nwaking up. Seeing that Zhu Yuswan's eyes\nwere about to open, Wei Wu immediately\nmoved his face close without saying a\nword. as soft red lips were pressed\nagainst her face. Zhu Yuwan opened her\neyes, still half asleep, noticing the\nunusual sensation on her lips, Zhu Yuwan\nsuddenly opened her eyes. But at that\nmoment, Wayi Wu covered his cheek,\nlooking at her with a shocked\nexpression. Yusuan, I just wanted to\nwake you up, but you you're really\nserious. Young master, I I know. I I\ndon't know. Seeing that Zuyuan&lt;unk&gt;s\nface had turned red, we wu slowly spoke.\nA him. All right, considering how well-\nbehaved you usually are, I won't hold it\nagainst you. Go back and rest. Without\nwaiting for Zhuan&lt;unk&gt;s response, he got\nup and walked towards the bedroom. It\nwasn't until Wei Wu entered the room\nthat Zhu Yuswan fully woke up and\nrealized that something was wrong. Then\nI saw her covering her blushing cheeks\nwith her hands, her eyes watery. Young\nmaster, how can you be like this? It was\nclearly someone else's fault, yet you\ninsist it was someone else's. At this\npoint, Zhu Yusuan couldn't continue, got\nup, and jogged away from the main house.\nAn awkward situation vanished without a\ntrace, thanks to Wei Wuians shameless\naudacity. Meanwhile, a dark cloud of\nmalice was brewing in the shadows. The\neastern palace of the Forbidden City,\nCrown Princess Lu walked with light\nsteps and slowly pushed open the door to\nthe crown prince's study. At this\nmoment, Crown Prince Zu Bao was\nreviewing memorials sent from all over\nthe country. Lady Lu stepped forward,\ngently stroking Zhu Bao's shoulders with\nher jade-like hands and said tenderly,\n\"My lord, it's getting late. You must\ntake care of yourself.\" Upon hearing\nLou's voice, Zhuao turned around and\nsmiled slightly, \"You should go to sleep\nfirst. These memorials will take some\ntime to process. Then I will cook a bowl\nof jinseng soup for my husband. You must\ndrink it.\" After speaking, Madame Lu\nwithdrew her hands, made a secret\ngesture behind her back, and then turned\nto leave. Once Madame Louu had closed\nthe gate, the smile on Zhu Bao&lt;unk&gt;'s\nface vanished. Leo, how's the\ninvestigation into the crown princess's\nmatter going from the shadows? Leo\nslowly emerged and knelt before Zua.\nYour highness, there have been no\nresults yet. Go on, do what you're\nsupposed to do. Yes, this servant takes\nher leave. Upon receiving Zhu Bao&lt;unk&gt;s\norder, Leong slowly retreated into the\nshadows and then disappeared from the\nroom. Meanwhile, Lady Lu went to the\nkitchen and ordered someone to light the\nstove. After dismissing all the palace\nservants, he went alone to the table to\nprocess the jinseng. After a few\nminutes, Lady Lu slowly raised her head\nand spoke to the air. Come out. This\nservant greets your majesty. A voice\nresponded from the darkness. And then a\nfigure appeared in the kitchen. It was\nLeaf Foam. The crown princess did not\nlook at Leaf Foam, but focused intently\non processing the Jinsenang roots. Has\nChui confessed? I have not confessed.\nHas the crown prince given you any\ninstructions? Your highness has ordered\nme to investigate the smallox case to\nsee if it was manipulated. Upon hearing\nthis answer, Madame Louu paused in her\nwork, then continued to ask,\n\"Investigate me?\" His highness only\nmentioned checking for smallpox, but did\nnot directly mention checking for the\nempress. Lady Louu remained silent for a\nwhile before continuing to ask\nquestions. Because of that man named Wei\nWu, yes, pass on this message for me.\nMake this person disappear. We woo is\nprotected by the embroidered uniform\nguard dispatched by his majesty. Only\ncare about the results. This servant\nunderstands. Leong responded with a\nsingle sentence and then disappeared\nwithout a trace. One night passed. The\nnext morning, Wayi Wu opened his eyes\nand stretched vigorously. Oh dear, I\nslept so soundly last night that I\nforgot to open the package. Switching\nhis gaze to the system warehouse, Wayi\nWu randomly selected a package that\nlooked pleasing to the eye. Then a\nplastic box appeared in front of him\nwhich looked a bit like the kind of\nincubator used for preserving organs.\nThey're not going to send me my heart,\nliver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys, are\nthey? With a mix of trepidation and\nexcitement, we woo opened the box only\nto find that it contained medicine\ninstead of organs. We didn't know what\nthis thing was either. He only saw the\nwords techcoat printed on the medicine\nbox. When he opened one of the boxes and\ntook out the instruction manual, joy\nimmediately filled Nida. Good heavens,\nwhat I wished for just happened. system.\nI have to apologize to you. You're too\ndamn ambitious. Little Xionging. You\nwere truly destined to live. Your uncle\nis the greatest benefactor in your life.\nAnd then there's Empressma. From now on,\nI'll be like a crab in the capital,\ncovered in barbs and absolutely\nuntouchable.\nTechco Verramat. It is the only drug on\nthe market that has been approved for\nmarketing and has a targeted therapeutic\neffect on smallpox virus. Chapter 39.\nUnexpected incident. Yusen falls into a\ncoma. Weii Wu enraged looking at the\nentire box of medicine, let alone Zhu\nXianging and Empress Ma. Even if another\n10 or eight came, we wu&lt;unk&gt;s supply\nwould be more than enough. I got up\ndressed and was about to wash up when I\nsaw Dil Robbo walking carrying a basin\nof water. Young master, I heard you get\nup, so I fetch water for you to wash up.\nShiaoa placed the basin of water down\nand looked at wei Wu as if waiting for\npraise. Seeing this, we wu reached out\nand patted her little head. Dabba is\ngreat. By the way, why are you here\ntoday? Where is Yushuan? Previously, it\nwas who fetched water for way to wash\nup, so he was a little unaccustomed to\nit suddenly being done by Dabba.\nFortunately, Doraba immediately provided\nan answer. Young master said yesterday\nthat he wanted to eat wild vegetable\ndumplings. So, Sister Chingsha took\nSister Yuswan and Sister Leah to buy the\ningredients. Upon hearing this, Wayi Wu\nsuddenly remembered that he had indeed\nmentioned wanting to eat wild vegetable\ndumplings yesterday. At the same time,\nhe understood why Yuwan had gone with\nhim. The girl was probably too shy to\nsee him. But thinking about it, it makes\nsense. After all, these were women in\nancient times, and they weren't as open\nabout this as women in later\ngenerations. Although he had obtained a\nsmallox medicine, Weii Wu did not intend\nto send it over immediately. Things that\nare too easily obtained are not\nconsidered very valuable. It's best to\nwait and let old Ju and his family worry\na bit so that the value of the medicine\nis shown and they will appreciate our\nkindness more. This has nothing to do\nwith being selfish or not. In this\nunfamiliar world, he has to prioritize\nhimself. Just as Weii Wu was thinking\nthis, a series of chaotic noises\nsuddenly came from outside the courtyard\ngate. Wayiwi Wu was still wondering what\nwas going on when he saw a servant\nrushing into the courtyard in a panic.\nYoung master, young master, something\nterrible has happened. What's the matter\nthat you're in such a hurry? As soon as\nWu finished speaking, the servant ran up\nto him. Young master, Miss Yushuan, Miss\nChingshia, and Miss Leah are in trouble.\nUpon hearing that three of his maids had\nbeen in trouble, including Yusien, Weii\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s expression immediately\ndarkened. What happened to them? The\nservant had never seen Weii Wu with such\na serious expression before and was\nmomentarily startled. Miss Yusuan is\nunconscious. Miss Ching Xia is seriously\ninjured with several broken bones, and\nMiss Leah has a bruised and swollen\nface. What exactly happened, young\nmaster? I don't know either. Miss Leah's\neyes were red and she wouldn't say\nanything when asked, \"Where are they?\"\nThe manager has been assigned to the\nfront yard, which is the closest\navailable location. Upon hearing this,\nWayi Wu didn't hesitate and immediately\nstroed towards the front yard. As soon\nas I arrived at the gate of the\ncourtyard, I saw Leah clutching her\nchest, sitting on the steps in a\ndisheveled state. Not only were his\nclothes torn in many places, but his\nface was also covered in bruises. When\nLeah saw Wei Wu enter, her eyes\nimmediately reened. Just as she was\nabout to get up, Wayi Wu was already\nstanding in front of her. Leah, where\nare Yushuan and Ching Xia? Sister Yusuan\nand Sister Ching Xia are inside. The\ndoctor is examining their injuries and\nGranny Wong is helping them. Granny Wong\nwas a rough housekeeper in a household\nand when we wu heard that she was\ninside, he gave up the idea of going in.\nWe can only ask the doctor about the\nspecifics when he comes out. But before\nthat, what he really wants to know is\nwhat happened. Leah, tell me what\nhappened after you went out. Upon\nhearing this, Leah could no longer hold\nback her tears, which immediately\nstreamed down her face. This morning, my\ntwo older sisters and I went out to\nshop. Lara recounted the story while\ntears streamed down her face. It turned\nout that they had run into someone they\nknew from the Jaangy, a governmentrun\nentertainment district, this morning\nwhile they were shopping. That's right.\nChing Xia and the other three all came\nfrom the Jaifang, a government-run\nentertainment institution. The Jaifang\nunder the jurisdiction of the Ministry\nof Rights was originally an institution\nrelated to rights, music, and dance.\nHowever, in the Ming dynasty, in\naddition to these, the Jaangy Imperial\nMusic Bureau also trained official\nprostitutes to supply government-run\nbrothel. Most of the women were former\nofficials or relatives of wealthy\nfamilies. Because they were guilty of a\ncrime but not punishable by death, they\nwould be demoted to a lowly status and\nsent to the Jaangy, a government-run\nentertainment district. Women who were\nbeautiful and skilled in music, chess,\ncalligraphy, and painting would be sent\nto government-run brothel to serve\ncustomers. Women who are beautiful but\nlack skills will also be sent there\nafter training. Only those who lack\nbeauty and have no skills will become\nslaves to be sold in brokerage firms.\nThe woman that Ching Shia and her\nfriends met today was of average\nappearance, barely above average.\nOriginally, this woman was supposed to\nundergo training and then be sent to a\ngovernmentr run brothel. Unfortunately,\nbecause of Ching Sha and the others,\nthat person was eliminated and almost\nbecame a slave. However, this woman did\nnot want to become a servant or slave.\nShe only wanted to go to a\ngovernment-run brothel to live a better\nlife. Thus, the conflict arose and she\nresented Ching Xia and the other three\nfor taking away her opportunity. Just\nthen, Zhu Yuan Jang issued an order to\nbestow rewards and Ching Xia and the\nother few best ones were sent to Wei\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s side. Then, the woman got her\nchance and finally achieved her wish of\nbecoming a proud service worker.\nHowever, she did not feel relieved by\nthis. Instead, she kept brooding over\nit. Today, I happened to run into\nBridget Lynn and her friend shopping on\nthe street, so I stopped them. Bridget\nLynn and the others didn't recognize her\nat first until the woman revealed her\nidentity herself. Bridget Lynn and the\nothers originally thought they were\nmeeting up to catch up and were quite\nhappy to run into someone they knew.\nAfter only a few words, the woman's\nattitude changed after she found out\nabout their recent situation. What\nstarted as sarcastic insults eventually\nescalated into outright abuse. Ching Xia\nthought it was better to avoid trouble\nand didn't want to bother with this\ncrazy woman. However, the woman suddenly\nturned her attack on their master Wuhan\nwas displeased and immediately stood up\nto refute her. Bridget Lynn and Leah\nalso angrily argued with the other\nparty. Unfortunately, the three little\ngirls were no match for that woman.\nAfter all, he came from a brothel, so he\ncould spout vulgarities with ease.\nMoreover, the woman was accompanied by\nseveral burly men who intimidated Ching\nShia and the others with their imposing\npresence. Furthermore, she didn't care\nabout her status as a prostitute at all.\nOn the contrary, she was proud of living\na more comfortable life. Normally, it\nwould have absolutely no effect on her.\nIn her anger, Bridget Lynn uttered a\nsentence that directly hit the woman's\nsore spot. You're just a backup option.\nIf we hadn't followed the young master,\nyou wouldn't even be worthy of being a\nprostitute. That one sentence ripped\nopen the woman's wounds. Enraged, he\nordered the burly men around him to beat\nup Ching Xia and the others. Bridget\nLynn was also the one who was beaten the\nmost severely because of those words,\nand several bones in her body were\nbroken. Zu Yushwan wasn't hit, but she\nwas pushed by someone in the chaos. He\naccidentally hit his head when he fell\nand immediately lost consciousness.\nHowever, precisely because of this, the\nother party was worried about causing a\ndeath. So, they stopped and left.\nFortunately, a few kind Annies helped me\nhire a cart so that I could bring my two\nsisters back. After hearing Leah's\ndescription, Wayi Wu&lt;unk&gt;s face was so\ngloomy it could drip water. Tell me,\nwhat's that woman's name? And which\nfloor of the 16story buildings along the\nChinuai River is she on? Chapter 40.\nDare to touch my people. You're asking\nfor death. Upon hearing we woo&lt;unk&gt;s\nquestion, Leah dared not conceal\nanything. I don't know which floor she's\non. I only heard those burly men calling\nher Missy. Moonplum, a cold glint\nflashed in ways eyes. Looks like I'll\nhave to take a trip to the Chinhai River\ntonight. The so-called 16 brothel of the\nChin Hawaii River refers to the 16\ngovernmentrun brothel along the Chinhai\nRiver. In fact, this was all created by\nold Jew. Old Jew believed that brothel\nand brothel could not be eradicated and\nthat people needed an outlet for their\npinup emotions. Therefore, the imperial\ncourt simply established government-run\nbrothel which could both punish\nconvicted women and increase tax\nrevenue. They are Ching Jang Tower,\nHeming Tower, Zuatian Tower, Jiian\nTower, Lemon Tower, Ching Tower and\nSuilio Tower. There are also Mayanlu,\nDanlu, Ujulu, Goffilu, Levenla,\nChangila, and Gafila. This 14-story\nbuilding is located on the banks of the\nChinuay River and is also known as the\n14-story building of flowers, moon, and\nspring river. Together with the South\nMarket and North Market buildings,\nthey're collectively known as the 16\nbuildings of the Chinuai River. It can\nbe said to be the most bustling and\nvibrant location in Beijing with\ncolorful buildings and houses lining\nboth banks of the river. Every night,\nthe lights here illuminate the river,\ncreating a dazzling spectacle like a\ngalaxy. From a man's perspective, Wayi\nWu didn't see anything wrong with this.\nAfter all, even in later generations,\nmany countries still relied on this as\ntheir main source of tax revenue. He\nnever expected that he would become\nconnected with his famous brothel in\nthis way. Just as Wei Wu was pondering\nhow to find someone to take revenge\ntonight, the door was suddenly pushed\nopen. An elderly man with a white beard\nslowly walked out of the house carrying\na medicine box. Upon seeing this, Wayi\nWu immediately stepped forward. \"Doctor,\nhow are my two maids injured?\" The old\nman looked at wei Wu, stroked his long\nbeard, and slowly said, \"The seriously\ninjured girl suffered multiple\nfractures, but fortunately, her life is\nnot in danger. She will recover after a\nfew months of medication and rest.\" The\nother girl who suffered a head injury\nhas woken up and is fine. She just needs\nto rest for a few days.\" Weii Wu\nbreathed a sigh of relief and turned to\nthe servant beside him, instructing,\n\"Notify the manager to give the doctor\ndouble the consultation fee and send\nsomeone to take the doctor back.\" The\nold man left with the servant with a\nhappy expression and Wayi Wu also led\nLeah into the house. As soon as I\nentered, I heard Zhu Yuan andQing Shia\ntalking. Ching Xia, Sister Yushuan,\nLeah, and I have caused trouble for the\nyoung master. Will he be angry if he\nfinds out? Zhuan, don't worry. Young\nmaster always dotes on us. He won't be\nangry about this. Ching Sha Sister\nYusuan, the young master usually dotes\non you the most. If he doesn't want us,\ncould you please plead for me and Leah?\nAt this point, Bridget Lynn's voice\ntrembled and trembled with sobs. We just\nwant to serve our young master well. We\ndon't want to leave here. We don't want\nto leave our young master. Although Zhu\nYuan was a princess, she could\ncompletely understand Ching Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s\nworries. During this time, Wayiu spent\ntime with them without ever putting on\nan arrogant or condescending attitude.\nThey played and joked together and would\nshare delicious food with the maids. How\nmany masters treat their servants so\nwell, not to mention the maids like\nChing Shia, even Princess Zu Yusuan was\nreluctant to leave this place. Based on\nwhat Juu Yuwan had learned over the past\nfew days, Wayi Wu certainly wouldn't get\nangry at them because of this. In this\nsituation, her words are useless. Only\nWayi Wu&lt;unk&gt;s personal statement that he\nwill not blame them will suffice. All\nshe can do now is try her best to\ncomfort Bridget Lynn. If I mean, if the\nyoung master really wants to kick you\nout, I will try to see if I can plead\nfor you. However, the young master is\nusually so good to us. I believe you\nwill not be angry about this, much less\nkick you out. Hearing that Zhu Yuan was\nwilling to plead for her, Ching\nXiao&lt;unk&gt;s brows relaxed slightly.\nHowever, they quickly reassembled due to\nphysical pain. Just then, Weii Wu&lt;unk&gt;s\nangry voice came from outside the gate.\nWho says I don't get angry? Let me tell\nyou, I'm so angry right now that my\nlungs are about to explode. So angry\nthat I want to kill someone. As they\nwere talking, Wayu had already brought\nLeah to the bedside. He first reached\nout and touched Yusuan&lt;unk&gt;s head, but\ninstead touched a large bulging bump.\nSeeing Yu Xians little face contorted in\npain, Weii Wu felt a pang of heartache.\nTurning to look at Ching Xia, he saw her\nlowering her head in fear, not daring to\nlook at him. Seeing this, Wei Wu spoke\nagain. \"You little girls remember this.\nI'm angry because my people were bullied\nand beaten up. Only I can bully my\npeople. I get angry if anyone else even\ntouches you. I'll avenge you for this.\nAfter saying that, Wayi Wu flipped his\nwrist and took out three bags of silky\nwhite chocolate, handing them to the\nthree people, respectively. Young\nmaster, I don't know anything about\nmedicine. I can only give you some\nsnacks. Eating something sweet might\nmake the pain less. All right, you all\ncan rest at home. Remember, next time\nyou go out shopping, take a few servants\nwith you. A mere prostitute dares to be\nso arrogant. She thinks she's superior\njust because she's a prostitute. You is\nthat it? I like to see just how awesome\nshe is. After saying that, Wayi Wu\ndidn't say anything more to the three\nwomen and turned to leave the room. As\nsoon as he came out of the room, Wayi Wu\nstood in the courtyard and shouted. One\nof the embroidered uniform guards has\ncome out, \"Something's up.\" Not long\nafter he shouted, a figure outside the\ncourtyard gate came to him and bowed.\nYoung Master Way, what is it? What is\nyour surname? Jean Ha, a despicable\nperson. We nodded, then continued. My\nmate has been beaten. I'm going to Chin\nHuai River tonight. Are you coming with\nme or staying here? His majesty has\nordered us to protect Young Masterways\nsafety. Wherever you go, we will go. How\nmany of you are there in total? There\nare 60 people in total, divided into two\nteams to take turns guarding. There are\nonly 30 brothers around the mansion.\nWeii Wu said nothing but directly\nordered someone to have a steward bring\n100 strings of cash and give them to\nJang Hao. Send someone to the Chin Huai\nRiver to investigate a prostitute named\nMa. I need to know which floor she's on.\nAfter you found out the truth, don't\nalert her. Go directly to the madam and\ntell her that I'm going to book that\nwoman named you tonight. Agree to\nwhatever amount of money she asks for. I\nonly have one request. You must keep her\nhere. The rest of the money is for you\nto distribute among the brothers as a\nreward for their hard work. Even though\nthey had no money, Jean Ha and his men\nhad to do whatever Weii Wu ordered them\nto do. Not to mention that we woo even\ngave the money. So naturally, they had\nno objections. So after receiving the\nmoney, Jang Hao immediately sent someone\nto the Chinuai River to gather\ninformation. When the messenger returned\nin the evening, Jangha immediately went\nto find Wei Wu. Young Master Way. It has\nbeen confirmed that the prostitute named\nYume is a cortisan at Mayan Pavilion. In\naddition, Yu was taken a liking to a\nwealthy merchant named Zhao Shaana, who\nspent 20 strings of cash to book her.\nUpon hearing this, Weii Wu waved his\nhand, indicating that he would no longer\npay attention to the money that had\nalready been given away. As long as\nthings are done properly, that's all\nthat matters. So Wayi Wu immediately\nspoke up after Jean Hao finished\nspeaking. Let's take the people and head\nto Mayan Tower. Chapter 41 my first\nvisit to a brothel. And I even got\nscammed. Is 20 strings of cash a lot or\nnot? To be honest, it's not. In later\ngenerations, Chinuinu Ant's appearance\nfee reached as high as 1,000 tales,\nwhich is almost 1 million tales over 24\nyears. However, for you may, a woman who\nis neither a top cortisan nor a famous\nprostitute. 20 tales was an astronomical\nprice. One string of paper money is\nequal to 1,000 coins or one tail of\nsilver. And 20 strings of paper money is\n20 tales of silver. Keep in mind that it\nwas only the 15th year of the Hong Woo\nreign, and the paper money had only been\nissued for a few years, so it hadn't\ndepreciated like it would later.\nMoreover, the entrance fee to a brothel\nis only seven coins. When Shiman Shing\nfirst entered the Lichuan brothel, he\nonly spent five tales of silver. It only\ncost 20 tales to hire a woman for the\nentire first month of the year. While\nWeii Wu spent 20 tales just to hire you,\nMay for one day. However, as long as he\ncould achieve his goal, 20 tales was\nnothing to Wei Woo. Even 2,000 tales\nwouldn't have mattered. led by the\nembroidered uniform guard. Weii Woo and\nhis party of 61 people went directly to\nthe Chinuai River. Originally, there\nwere only 30 people, but since the shift\nchangers also arrived, he simply brought\nthem along. In front of the main gate of\nMayan building, we wu glanced coldly at\nthe magnificent gate, then turned to\nJeang Ha and said, \"You take two\nbrothers with you inside. The rest of\nyou wait outside. Let them act according\nto the situation.\" Jean Ha nodded. then\nled his men who had come to investigate\nduring the day and followed Weii Wu into\nMay Yin Tower. As soon as you enter the\ngate, you can see two large red lanterns\nhanging on both sides. Then upon\nentering the building, one sees oil\nlamps shrouded in mist and lotus-shaped\nlanterns hanging high above. The oil\nlamps weren't bright enough, but there\nwere plenty of various lanterns and\ncolored lights hanging in Mayan Tower.\nNot only does it make the interior less\ndark, but it also gives people an\nextremely ambiguous feeling. In\naddition, the black lacquered wooden\npillars standing in a lobby on the first\nfloor were all covered with light pink\nand purple gauze curtains. Meanwhile, on\nthe second floor, rows of red curtains\nhung high down. In the hall, at several\ntables, scantily clad women were\ndrinking with guests. They were dressed\nin the same thin gauze as the women\nwalking back and forth, only in\ndifferent colors. However, even though\ntheir fair arms and slender legs were\nvisible through the thin gauze, they\ndidn't care at all and instead smiled\ncoetishly. She seemed to be enjoying the\nmen's adoring gazes. Even the three\nImperial guards who came in with Weii Wu\ncouldn't help but be attracted to these\nwomen. Perhaps only Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s eyes\nremained clear, completely unaffected by\nthese women. The reason is simple. These\nwomen exposed their arms and thighs and\neven most of their shoulders. But in\nreality, it had no impact on him\nwhatsoever. Speaking of revealing\nclothes, he once saw many girls\ndisplaying most of their bodies while\nstrolling down a pedestrian street. It's\neven more so. Only the ancients, who\ncould only see such a sight by paying\nmoney, would be amazed by it, and even\nattracted by it. Just as the four of\nthem stopped to look around, an older\nwoman with rouge on her face walked\nover. As expected, it must be the madam\nof Mayanlu. She arrived with a beaming\nsmile and said, \"Oh, gentlemen, is this\nyour first time visiting Mayan Tower?\nWhat are you doing standing here at the\nentrance?\" The madam, a woman of many\nexperience, immediately recognized Weii\nWu as the key among the four. So when\nshe spoke, her eyes were always on him.\nHowever, Wayi Wu ignored the madam and\nonly glanced at Jang Hao. Immediately\nafterwards, one of the imperial guards\nbeside Jang Hao spoke up. Madam, you\nforgotten I came here during the day.\nOur young master spent 20 tales to book\nyou, ma. Upon hearing that it was about\nthe incident from that afternoon, the\nmadam's smile widened even more. Oh\ndear, what a terrible memory I have.\nIt's Young Master way. No wonder there\nwere magpies calling all afternoon.\nYoung Master Way, let me tell you, Miss\nhas been waiting for you so long that\nshe's grown quite weary. He he come,\nI'll have someone take you to Umay's\nroom right away. But I wonder how we\nshould arrange things for these three\ngentlemen. As she spoke, the madam\nbeckoned a maid to lead the way for Weii\nWu. However, before the maid could even\nget close, we wu waved his hand in\nrefusal. No need to go to the room. I'm\nin a good mood tonight, so let you may\ncome down and keep me company in the\nlobby. With that, we woo found an empty\nseat and pllopped down in it. Also, call\na few more girls to keep my brothers\ncompany. Remember, they have to be\npretty. Money is no object. The madam\ndoesn't care about anything else. But\nwhen she hears that money isn't a\nproblem, then she really doesn't have\nany problems at all. Subsequently, under\nthe madam's arrangement, the food and\nwine were quickly served. Meanwhile,\nthree pretty girls had already sat down\nnext to Jeang Hao and his group because\nthey had to protect Weii Wu. They didn't\ndrink any alcohol, but they certainly\ndidn't skimp on the oil. Interestingly,\nthe girl had already brought all the\nfood and drinks, but Ume still hadn't\ncome downstairs. Seeing this, before Wei\nWu could speak, Jean Hao immediately\nsent someone to fetch the madam. Madam,\nyour miss has quite the heirs. She took\nthe money and still expects our young\nmaster way to wait for her. The madam\nwas busy attending to other guests and\nhad no idea that u hadn't come\ndownstairs yet. Upon hearing this, the\nmadam's face immediately changed and she\ncursed u in her heart. But when facing\nWei Wu and his men, they still had to\nput on a smiling face. Young Master Wei,\nI apologize for keeping you waiting, but\nI don't know what's wrong with you. All\nright, I'll go find you for you right\nnow and have her toast you in person to\napologize and admit her mistake. Weii\nwouldn't speak but nodded in agreement.\nActually, he was also wondering why was\nacting so high and mighty since she\nwasn't some famous cortisan. After about\n5 minutes, the madam finally brought a\nwoman to Woo. Young master way you may\nwasn't feeling well just now and\naccidentally fell asleep in her room.\nI've already spoken to her about it.\nLook, she wasn't even properly dressed\nwhen I pulled her over. Please calm\ndown. I'll have her toast you and\napologize. Upon hearing the madam's\nwords, we wu raised his head and\ncarefully examined you. Indeed, the\nwoman's clothes were somewhat\ndisheveled, but Weii Wu noticed\nsomething a miss. First of all, eyes\ndidn't look like she had just woken up,\nand there was still a flush on her\ncheeks. Secondly, there was a small red\nmark on her neck which looked more like\na strawberry mark than a birth mark.\nWeiiwoo was not an ancient person. He\nunderstood perfectly what these things\nrepresented. She had obviously just\nreceived a customer. She probably hadn't\neven washed herself before the madam\nbrought her over. Weii Wu, who is\nalready seething with anger, turned even\ndarker now. I spent money and got ripped\noff like a fool. This is just too much.\nTurning his head, Wayi Wu looked at the\nmadam expressionlessly and said coldly,\n\"You old Are you trying to fool\nme, young master?\" The madam, completely\nunfazed by Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s insults,\ncontinued to smile and say, \"Young\nMaster Way, I don't understand what you\nmean either. Really? You don't\nunderstand?\" Fine. Have her take off her\nclothes. I'll see if you really don't\nunderstand. Chapter 42. A prostitute.\nHuh? Come on. Do 500 squats first. Weii\nWu spoke softly, but his words were very\nblunt. It immediately caught the\nattention of those around it, and all\neyes turned to it. Meanwhile, the madam\nfinally realized that we woo was\nserious, and a troubled look appeared on\nher face. Young Master Wei, although our\nMayan pavilion is a place for pleasure,\nthe girls still have some sense of\npropriety. May I have you may serve you\nin your room? It's too embarrassing for\na young lady to undress in public like\nthis. In fact, the madam knew perfectly\nwell what we wu meant. How could she not\nknow? When she went upstairs just now,\nshe saw with her own eyes being\ntormented by a man. But she couldn't say\nanything about it. So, she could only\npretend to be stupid and try to cover it\nup. At the very least, it would be best\nto take way Woo upstairs to her room and\nresolve the matter privately. After all,\nshe had received money from someone else\nto hire her, but the girl was secretly\nentertaining other customers. If word\ngets out about this, who want to spend\nmoney to find girls at Mayan Tower\nanymore? However, Weii Wu came here\ntoday specifically to cause trouble. So,\nhow could he let the madam fool him so\neasily, knowing full well that the madam\nwas trying to smooth things over? He\ndecided to be blunt and clear. Have her\nserve you? Huh? She was just making love\nwith someone else in the room, and now\nshe's going to serve me after getting\nall dirty. I spent 20 tales to book her\nout for today. Is this how May Yanlu\ndoes business? Fine, I'll play along\nwith you to the end today. Jang Hao, go\nfind a hundred beggars and tell them\nthat I'm treating them to a brothel in\nwomen. Upon hearing Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s order,\nJean Hao immediately gave a look to his\nsubordinates. The latter understood and\nwithout saying a word got up and walked\ntowards the outside of Mayan building.\nThe madam was now completely panicked.\nOf course, she wanted to make money, but\nshe couldn't make this kind of money.\nOtherwise, no one would come to meet\nYanlu. There are plenty of women in the\n16th floor of the capital who would be\nwilling to spend money to find these\ngirls who have been played by beggars.\nEven if you don't mind the dirt, you'll\nstill worry about catching some disease\nyou shouldn't have. Seeing that the\nImperial Guard had already walked out\nthe door, the madam hurriedly begged\nWayi Wu for mercy. Young Master Wei, my\ndear young master way, you can't do\nthis. If you send a beggar like this,\nhow will May Yanlu ever do business\nagain? What? You're afraid I'll pay you.\nDon't worry. I've got plenty of money.\nI'll double the beggar's bill tonight.\nThis this this this isn't about money.\nYoung Master Way, please be magnanimous\nand spare us. Wayu turned to look at the\nmadam and snorted coldly. You want to\nstop playing? Sure. Make her take off\nher clothes to prove her identity. After\nspeaking, Wayi Wu looked directly at you\nMay, whose face was filled with panic\nand said again, \"If I'm wrong, I'll book\nthe entire building for you today, and\nall your expenses will be on me. But if\nI'm right, I won't cause trouble for\nyour madam, but she has to give me an\nexplanation.\" At this point, we\nwoo&lt;unk&gt;s eyes widened and he roared\nangrily at Ume. Take it off. Upon\nhearing this angry shout, Umeay, who was\nalready in a panic, turned pale and fell\nto the ground. The onlookers around them\nalso understood what had happened. As\nfellow clients of prostitutes, they\nfully understood Wei Woo and firmly\nstood by his side. Take it off. Take it\noff. Take it off. If you take the money\nand still sleep with other people, you\nhave to take your clothes off to prove\nyour identity. Take it off. You have to\ntake it off. Damn it. This is\noutrageous. Even prostitutes have to\nabide by the rules. We all support you,\nyoung master. She must verify her\nidentity. Seeing that all the other\nguests were joining in the commotion,\nthe madam was truly at a loss. If we woo\nwas there to cause trouble, she could\nhave called her guards and thugs to\ndrive him away. But now they're in the\nright and she knows perfectly well what\nthe situation really is. Finally, having\nexhausted all other options, the madam\nmade her decision. The madam originally\nintended to cover it up since Wayi Wu\nhad said that you was serving drinks in\nthe lobby on the first floor. Thinking\nthat when we Woo was about to enter the\nroom, she would find an excuse to have\nyou may wash up first before serving\nhim. But now the situation is beyond her\ncontrol. Compared to having a hundred\nbeggars ruin her, giving up is the\nchoice with the least loss. After\nletting out a long sigh, the madam\nfinally spoke. Young Master way, I won't\nlie to you anymore. When I went up there\njust now, that was indeed\nentertaining customers. But May and Lou\nreally knew nothing about this. This\nsecretly took on customers in order\nto make money. I really have no other\nchoice. Since you can't get rid of your\nresentment, I'll hand this over to\nyou. Do whatever you want with her. As\nlong as she doesn't get hurt, that's\nfine. Also, Mayanlu will cover your and\nthese other guests expenses tonight. How\nabout that? You may still held a glimmer\nof hope, but the madam's words plunged\nher into despair. In this May Yanlu,\nwithout the madam's protection, she was\nnot even as good as a rat in the gutter.\nThe young master way in front of her was\nclearly not someone to be trifled with.\nSo, u immediately knelt down. Young\nMaster Way, I was wrong. Please forgive\nme, young master way. I promise I will\nwash myself clean and serve you well. As\nyou may spoke, she cried. Her face stre\nwith tears, but we woo remained unmoved.\nHe didn't even glance at you, ma, but\nturned to look at the madam. You don't\nneed to worry about the expenses. I like\neverything except money. Just remember\nwhat you said. She is at my disposal.\nThe madam was speechless and could only\nnod to indicate that she understood.\nSeeing this, we wu turned to look at you\nand said in a calm tone, \"Take it off.\"\nAt this moment, Yuime knew very well\nthat she had no choice or room for\nresistance. They had no choice but to\nobey Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s orders, their clothes\nslipping off their shoulders one by one.\nThen he wrapped his arms around himself\nand stood naked in the hall. The\nonlookers immediately started to jeer\nand some even whistled. But at that\nmoment, Wei Wu spoke up again. Stand up.\nYou may stood up in fear. But then she\nheard Wayi Wu&lt;unk&gt;s voice. Squat down.\nhelpless. You'll make it only slowly\nsquat down. Just as she was wondering\nwhat we woo was trying to do, we woo\nspoke again. Do this 500 times. If you\ndo it even once less, I'll have those\nhundred beggars give you a good beating.\nUpon hearing this, not only you, MA, but\nalso the madam and the onlookers were\ndumbfounded. What the hell? Coming to a\nbrothel and paying prostitutes to strip\nnaked and do squats in public.\nAdmittedly, it does seem a bit childish,\nbut was way really just playing around.\nOf course not. He didn't come here to\nplay around. He came to avenge Zhu Yuwan\nand the others. The hundred beggars\nhaven't arrived yet. So, let's just\ntease that wretched Yu for a bit. In\naddition to May, none of the thugs who\nattack Zu Yuwan will escape either.\nUnderway Wu&lt;unk&gt;s coercion, you may dare\nnot resist and began to do squats in\nfront of everyone. It must be said that\neven in a brothel, it would be difficult\nto see such a spectacular scene. The\nguests in the hall were immediately\ndrawn to this scene. However, just as\neveryone was focused on the matter, the\nimperial guard who had been looking for\nthe beggar finally returned. Chapter 43.\nEven the heavenly king himself couldn't\nsave her. I'm telling you, the imperial\nguards who were originally panting were\nimmediately drawn to Ume's body as soon\nas they entered the room. Even his rapid\nbreathing calmed down at one point. It's\ntrue that someone as insignificant as\nhim wouldn't even stoop to visiting a\nbrothel, let alone witness such a\nspectacular scene. Fortunately, he\nremembered his mission and immediately\ncame to Wayi Wu&lt;unk&gt;s side. Young Master\nWay, we have found the beggars, but\nthere are too many of them, about 150.\nOnce they heard that someone was\ninviting them to visit brothel, they\nwouldn't leave, no matter how hard I\ntried to get rid of them. I really had\nno other choice. Do you want it? Before\nthe man could finish speaking, Wayi Woo\nwaved his hand to interrupt him. No\nneed. A few dozen more won't make a\ndifference. It's just a matter of\nspending a little money. Let's continue\nwatching the show. Actually, this person\nhad wanted to see it for a long time,\nbut he needed to report the mission\nsituation to Wei Wu first. Now that he\nhad Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s permission, he couldn't\nwait to turn and look at Ume. Those eyes\nwere fixed intently on the most\nimportant parts of Ume's body. He wished\nhe could turn his gaze into reality and\nthen ravage. After a long, long time,\nunder everyone's watchful eyes,\npainstakingly completed 500 squats.\nSeveral times during the journey, she\ncollapsed to the ground from exhaustion,\ncrying and begging way Woo to forgive\nher. However, the answer I received each\ntime was always the same. 100 beggars.\nThe thought of being violated by\nhundreds of dirty beggars made tremble\nwith fear. Ultimately driven by fear,\nshe unleashed astonishing potential. I\nmanaged to do 500 squats, but I was so\nexhausted that I couldn't move at all.\nOf course, at this moment, she also\nbreathed a sigh of relief, no longer\nworried about being abused by the\nbeggar. However, when she looked at Wayi\nWoo with pleading eyes, she received no\nresponse. We will looked at her\nindifferently. then sneered and looked\nat the madam. There are 150 beggars\noutside. I won't waste your rooms. I'll\nhave someone prepare a woodshed and lock\nher up with the beggars. Upon hearing we\nwoo&lt;unk&gt;s words, \"You may, who had\ncollapsed to the ground, was filled with\nfear. Even though I did everything as\nrequested, why is this person still\nunwilling to let me go?\" She was filled\nwith resentment, but too exhausted to\nspeak, and could only stare intently at\nWayi Wu. The madam standing nearby was\nalso surprised that we wu would actually\nask him to serve those beggars. There\nare 150 people here and they are all\nbeggars who have no women to vent their\nfrustrations on. If they really ruin\nher, you may will probably be ruined.\nThinking of that outcome, the madam\nimmediately wanted to plead for Wei Woo\nto change the punishment. However, just\nas she was about to speak, Weii Wu spoke\nfirst. Remember what you just said. I'll\ndeal with this woman. Don't you dare\nreig on my promise, madam. In fact, not\nonly the madam, but also the other\nonlookers felt that we woo had gone too\nfar. After all, she was a beautiful\nyoung woman, and they had just had a\nfeast for the eyes. Now they're going to\nbe ruined by beggars and so many of them\nat that. It's such a waste. They're all\njust spending money to have fun, and\nthey wouldn't risk offending anyone by\nstanding up for prostitutes over\nsomething like this. After a moment of\nsilence, the madam finally spoke. Young\nMaster Wei, if she's really violated by\nthose beggars, even if she survives, she\nwill become a After hearing the\nmadam's words, Weii Wu sneered inwardly\njust to ruin her. You're overthinking\nit. Do you think I let her off so\neasily? Thinking of this, we wu directly\ntook out a stack of banknotes and\nslammed them on the table. You're\nworried she won't be able to take\ncustomers in the future? No problem.\nJust take out the contract of indenture\nand I'll buy her. Since you're not one\nof May Yin Lu's people, there's no need\nto feel sorry for yourself, but you\nbetter think it through before you name\nyour price.\" These boastful remarks left\nthe madam speechless. However,\nconsidering that she was in the wrong,\nthe madam had no choice but to grit her\nteeth and admit it. Today, we receive a\ndeposit of 20 tales of silver from young\nMaster Wei. But our May Yin Lu girls\nhave made a grave mistake and angered\nhim. In this way, young master way only\nneeds to pay another 10 tales of silver\nand Ume's indenture will belong to young\nmaster way. Honestly, the price to madam\noffered was a really reasonable one. The\nredemption fee for a prostitute of\nordinary quality is generally around 30\ntales and the highest will not exceed 50\ntales. If it weren't for a wealthy\nmerchant vying for it today, the cost of\nbooking you may wouldn't have been as\nhigh as 20 tales of silver brothel. You\nknow, they're basically places where\npeople are hung up and sold. Whoever\npays the most money gets to keep it.\nHowever, this amount of money was\nnothing to weigh Woo and he immediately\ntook out 10 strings of cash. However,\njust as the madam was about to take the\nmoney, a voice suddenly came from the\ncrowd. Wait a minute. I'll offer 50\ntales of silver to redeem Miss according\nto the rules of Mayan Pavilion, the\nhighest bitter winds. This immediately\ndrew the attention of everyone present,\nincluding Weii Wu. A fat, bloated man\nemerged from the crowd quickly\napproached and helped her up. Upon\nseeing this man, u felt as if she had\nseen a savior and her eyes immediately\nturned red. The madam's face immediately\ndarkened when she saw the man because\nwhen she went upstairs just now, the man\nwho was on top of was this man. If it\nweren't for him, Mayanlu wouldn't have\ncaused so much trouble. And now she even\ndares to come out and cause more\ntrouble. Therefore, as soon as the man\nfinished speaking, the madam immediately\nrefused. My lord, the rule is that the\nhighest bidder wins. But made a mistake\nfirst, and this is her way of\napologizing to young master. 100 tales,\nI'll give you 100 tales. converted to 24\nyears. One coin was equal to $1 and 100\ntales were equal to 100,000. Wayiw was\nsomewhat surprised that this man was\nwilling to spend 100,000 yuan to redeem\nyou may from her servitude. If nothing\nunexpected happens, he should be the\nwealthy businessman named Joe Shanha and\nalso the man upstairs just now. However,\nthis man is just a wealthy merchant.\nWould take him seriously with him here\ntoday. Even if the heavenly king himself\ncame, you may wouldn't be able to escape\nthis calamity. Of course, we wu had no\nintention of competing with this person\nbecause there was simply no need for it.\nJust as the man was full of confidence\nthat he could redeem Yume, we wu looked\ndirectly at Jean Hao and said, \"It's up\nto you. Do whatever you want with him.\nWhether you beat him or lock him up, I\njust don't want to see him.\" Jean Hao\nnodded, said nothing, and simply waved\ntowards the gate. Then two men rushed\nin, pinning Zhao Shaunha down on either\nside as they prepared to leave. But at\nthat moment, the madam suddenly spoke up\nto stop her. Young Master way, we have\nnothing to say about your punishment of\nyou may, but you cannot be violent\ntowards our guests in May Yanlu. No\nsooner had the madam finished speaking\nthan seven or eight burly bodyguards and\nthugs emerged from May Yan Tower.\nHowever, they didn't attack immediately.\nInstead, they stood behind the madam who\nthen spoke. Young Master way, business\nis all about harmony and making money.\nMayanlu doesn't want to make things\ndifficult for you. As for your grudge\nwith this customer, we'd like to resolve\nthis after you leave Mayan Tower.\nOtherwise, we'll have no choice but to\nleave you there and wait for the\nauthorities to handle it. After being\nthwarted time and again, Wayi Wu is\nalready losing patience. Is that so? But\nI've lost my patience. If you don't want\nto make things difficult for me, then\nI'll make things difficult for you\ntoday. After saying that, Wayi Wu turned\naround and shouted something toward the\ndoor. Everyone get in here. Chapter 44.\nThose who have laid a hand on us. None\nof them will escape. At Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s\ncommand, all the Imperial guards outside\nrushed in, including Jeang Ha and his\ngroup. There were more than 60 burly men\nwho filled the hall. The madam and her\nbodyguards were also surprised that Weii\nWu had brought so many people with him.\nAside from the girls, Mayanlu only had\nabout 20 or 30 guards, thugs, servants,\nand miscellaneous workers. Looking at\nthe group of fierce looking people in\nfront of her, the madam wished she could\ntear you, that to pieces. If this\nmatter isn't handled properly today, May\nand Lu might never be able to do\nbusiness again. While anxiously\nwondering how to handle the situation,\nthe madam secretly made a gesture behind\nher back. A pimp hiding in the shadows\nsaw the gesture and quietly left the\nhall without making a sound. He then ran\nquickly to the backyard of Mayan Tower,\nwent out through the back door and\nsprinted towards the government office.\nMeanwhile, while the madam the hall was\nstill anxiously trying to find a\nsolution, Weii Wu suddenly looked at\nyou. Do you know why I contacted you\ntoday? You may looked at Wayi Wu\ntimidly, her body trembling as she shook\nher head. Remember those three girls you\nbeat up today? I came here for them.\nAfter saying that, Wayi Wu didn't give\nyou May a chance to speak and directly\ngave the order. Throw this into the\nwoodshed and let those hundred odd\nbeggars outside give her a proper\nwelcome. Upon hearing Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s\norder, two Imperial guards immediately\ncame out and carried Ume away from the\nhall. At this moment, Wayi Wu turned to\nlook at Jean Hao. Regardless of whether\nthis woman lives or dies, and whatever\nthe condition of my maid, she will be\ndoubly injured. Clear? Jean Hao\nresponded, then gave a wink to his\nsubordinate, who understood and left.\nHowever, the matter did not end there.\nAfter dealing with Yu, we wu looked at\nthe madam again. Madam, Yume was taken\nout today, right? Yayan Pavilion even\nsent a few guards to follow her. These\nbastards severely injured my personal\nmaid. To tell you the truth, I came here\nto cause trouble. Hand over those guards\nand I'll leave immediately. Otherwise,\nI'll tear down your May Yin Tower. Only\nthen did the madam finally understand\nwhy things had escalated to this point.\nSo, they came here to cause trouble from\nthe very beginning. Even without\nbreaking the rules, she still couldn't\nescape being tortured in the end. It's\ntoo late to know all this now. Their\nside is strong and well equipped, and\nshe's no match for them at all. After a\nmoment of silence, the madam finally\nrevealed her last trump card. Young\nMaster Wei, I don't know your identity,\nbut I advise you not to cause trouble at\nMayen Tower. These 16 towers along the\nChinhai River all belong to the Imperial\nCourt and are under the jurisdiction of\nthe Ministry of Rights. Your reckless\nactions will not end well. The madam\nthought that if she brought up the\nMinistry of Rights, Wayi Wu would be\nsomewhat wary. However, the reality was\nnot as she had imagined. Weiiw slowly\nsat down, his eyes calm and composed,\nlooking at the madam with a natural\nexpression. You talk too much nonsense,\nwhich I really dislike. So, you'd better\nhand over the person before I lose my\ntemper. I'll only count to three. If you\nsay another word of nonsense to me, I'll\nimmediately order the building to be\ndemolished. You can try me if you don't\nbelieve me. Whether way, Woo truly\ndidn't care about the Ministry of Rights\nand was really willing to demolish the\nbuilding. Even a madam wasn't sure.\nHowever, at that moment, a move by the\nImperial Guards made her realized that\nwe woo was truly daring. Because after\nWei Wu finished speaking, the Imperial\nGuard immediately drew the sword from\nhis robes. Only then did the madam\nrealize with horror that these people\nhad all brought knives with them. the\ncapital city. More than 60 people, all\nof them carrying knives. If it wasn't\nfor rebellion, then there's only one\npossibility. The young master way before\nus is of such high status that so many\npeople are needed to protect his safety.\nThis also proves one thing. May Yanlu\nsimply cannot afford to offend such a\nperson. At that moment, the madam felt\nimmense regret, wondering why she had\nbothered with that shameless woman,\nWimme, who had broken the rules. If they\nhadn't handed over the personnel from\nthe beginning, things wouldn't have\ngotten to this point. But what she\nregretted even more was that she\nshouldn't have gestured to the pimp to\ninform the authorities. For someone of\nWei Woos, even if the government sent\npeople, they might end up helping\nsomeone else. While filled with regret,\nthe madam put on a smile again, but this\ntime it was a truly awkward one. Young\nMaster way, please calm down. Hand over\nthe person, and we will give you an\nexplanation right away. After saying\nthat, the madam immediately turned to\nlook at the guards and thugs, and the\nsmile on her face turned into rage.\nWhich of you went out with that\nyou made today? Step forward. Although\nthe madam was furious. Who would dare to\nstand up in this situation? Fortunately,\nthere were only so many guards and thugs\nin May building, so this kind of thing\ncouldn't be kept secret. After the madam\nfinished speaking, the other guards\nimmediately looked at the three people\nstanding in the middle. The three of\nthem realized they couldn't hide it any\nlonger, and they resented Yume for\nharming them. At the same time, he knelt\ndown directly in front of Weii Wu,\nhoping to beg for his forgiveness. But\nwould we woo pay them any attention? The\nanswer is no. We didn't even glance at\nthem. And no matter how much the three\nmen cowed out and begged, it was no use.\nHe didn't even say a word, but just gave\nJean-Ho a look, and the latter\nimmediately understood what to do. The\nthree bodyguards then cried and begged\nfor mercy, but were still dragged away\nby several Imperial guards. The entire\nhall instantly became so quiet you could\nhear a pin drop. No one dared to even\nbreathe. Not long after, several sounds\nof bones breaking came from outside the\ndoor, followed by shrill screams. Then,\namid screams, the three bodyguards were\ndragged in by the Imperial guards.\nHowever, these three people are now\npractically useless with all the joints\nin their arms and legs broken. He was\nspitting out blood and lay sprawled on\nthe ground like a lump of mud, unable to\nmove. Seeing the miserable state of\nthese three people, everyone present\nfell silent. Even the madam was so\nfrightened that her face turned pale,\nlooking like she wanted to speak, but\ndare not. At this moment, we wu spoke\nagain. Now that I've handed over the\nperson, I'll keep my word and won't\ncause any trouble for your Mayan\nbuilding. After saying that, we woo\nstood up and casually pulled out more\nthan a dozen strings of cash and threw\nthem on the table. I'm sorry to have\nstartled you all. Consider this money as\nmy treat for drinks. Now, let's continue\nthe music and dancing. Seeing the\nterrified expressions on the faces of\nthose around him, Weii Wu smiled and\nturned to leave. But at that moment, a\nseries of rapid footsteps came from\noutside the door. We was still wondering\nwhat was happening outside and why so\nmany people had suddenly appeared. At\nthis moment, Jean Ho suddenly leaned\nclose to Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s ear and whispered,\n\"Young Master Wei, don't worry. They're\nfrom the Five Cities garrison\nresponsible for night patrols. Leave it\nto me.\" After saying that, Jean Ha took\nout a token from his pocket and prepared\nto go out and negotiate with the people\noutside. However, at that moment, a\nwhooshing sound suddenly rang out from\noutside the door, followed by an arrow\nflying into the hall. The rapidly flying\narrow grazed Jean Hao's cheek, leaving a\nbloody gash on his face. Realizing what\nwas happening, Jean Hao tackled Wei Woo\nto the ground while shouting, \"Protect\nyoung Master Wei.\" No sooner had he\nfinished speaking than a dozen arrows\nshot in from outside the door, heading\nstraight for Wayi Woo. Chapter 45. A gun\nis swift beyond seven paces, accurate\nand fast within seven paces.\nFortunately, Jean Ha shout prompted the\nImperial guards to react swiftly. As\nsoon as the arrows flew in, they drew\ntheir swords and stood in front of Wei\nWu. Unfortunately, the arrows were\nflying too fast, and only a small\nportion of them were blocked by their\nswords. Most of the rest were blocked by\ntheir bodies, but Wei Woo was unharmed.\nAfter blocking the first wave of arrows,\nWei Wu finally came to his senses. Just\nas he was about to draw his gun, he\nsuddenly found that he could not move\nhis hands. At the same time, Jean\nHa&lt;unk&gt;s voice came to my ears. The\nlobby and rooms on the first floor are\nnot safe. Take young master way to the\nrooms on the second floor immediately to\ntake shelter. It must be said that\nJeangha's decision was correct. Every\nroom in May building has a window.\nWithout knowing how many people are\nthere, the rooms on the first floor are\nsimply not enough to keep anyone out. On\nthe contrary, the second floor is far\nfrom the ground, making it easier to\ndefend. Subsequently, under the\nprotection of five Imperial guards, Wei\nWu was carried almost entirely off the\nground to a room on the second floor.\nTwo Imperial guards stood guard outside\nthe door while three others stood guard\nby the window inside the room. Weii Woo,\non the other hand, frowned and fell into\ndeep thought. You could tell from those\narrows that these people outside are\ndefinitely after us. However, he has not\nmade any enemies with anyone since he\ntransmigrated. It was only today in\norder to stand up for Zhu Yu Schwan and\nthe others that they came to May Tower\nand acted arrogantly. But even a fool\nwould know that May Yanlu couldn't\npossibly have any connection with these\npeople. In the Ming dynasty, crossbows\nwere considered military equipment,\nwhich were definitely prohibited items.\nThe charge of illegally possessing\nmilitary equipment is similar to that of\ntreason. Mayanlu was under the\njurisdiction of the Ministry of Rights\nand was a government-run brothel. It had\nneither the reason nor the courage to do\nso. Most importantly, they were able to\nmobilize manpower in the capital and\neven bring along prohibited weapons like\ncrossbows. It's easy to imagine that the\nperson behind sending them was not only\naudacious, but also someone of\nextraordinary status. Thinking of this,\nWeii Wu frowned even more deeply. Who is\nbehind this so eager to kill me? Old Ju\nwould never do it. Nor would Juaow.\nOtherwise, there would be no need for\nsuch trouble and the embroidered uniform\nguard could have taken action. Blue\nJade, no. Although Lan Yu is a reckless\nfool, he doesn't have the guts to use\nweapons to kill people otherwise, let\nalone old Zu. Even Zu Bao would have\nkilled him. Apart from Lan Yu, I had\nabsolutely no contact with any other\npowerful figures in the capital. It's\nimpossible that they just don't like me\nand think I'm in their way, so they want\nto get rid of me, etc. If they really\nthought I was in their way, that's why\nthey took such a big risk to kill me.\nThat proves that the risks and benefits\nof the matter I interfered with far\noutweighed the risk of killing me. The\nonly thing that fits this description is\nprobably the matter of the crown, Prince\nXu Xianging. That vile woman, Lou, it\nmust be her. Although there was no\nconclusive evidence, Wayi Wu was\nconvinced that the person behind it all\nwas Crown Princess Lu because only Zhu\nXiang Ing contracted smallox and it was\nonly after his suggestion that the\naccidental event became inevitable.\nMoreover, Zhu Yuan Jang arrested many\npeople from the Eastern Palace, clearly\nindicating that he was investigating the\nsmallox issue. On the day Zhu Yuan Jang\nordered a thorough investigation,\nCunning Palace was filled with palace\nmaids and Unix, a place teeming with\npeople and eyes. As the crown princess,\nLady Louu had no difficulty whatsoever\nin finding out what happened back then.\nTherefore, it makes sense to focus on\noneself. Bang. Just as Weii Wu was\npondering this, the sound of wood\nbreaking suddenly rang out in the room.\nTurning my head, I saw a group of men in\nblack smash through the wooden window\nand enter the house. Before the man in\nblack even landed, he flicked his wrists\nand two throwing knives shot out from\nhis sleeves. In the blink of an eye, the\ntwo throwing knives pierced the throats\nof the two Imperial guards. Then, with a\nflash of light, the last Imperial guard\nalso died under the blackclad man's\nblade. Having dealt with the three\nImperial guards in the room, the man in\nblack did not attack Wei Woo, but\ninstead rushed towards the door. Just\nthen, two Imperial guards outside the\ndoor heard the commotion and burst in.\nBefore they could even draw their\nswords. A streak of lightning slashed\nacross their throats, and they both fell\nto the ground dead. After dealing with\nthe two men, the man in black closed the\ndoor and then fixed his gaze on Wei Wu.\nTo be honest, if he hadn't seen it with\nhis own eyes, we would have thought he\nwas watching a martial arts movie. This\nperson's movements were incredibly fast,\nswift, and decisive, and his martial\narts prowess was terrifying. He was\ndressed in black, and his face was\ncovered with a black cloth, so his\nappearance was completely obscured.\nDespite being stared at, Wayi Wu did not\nshow any signs of panic. He didn't\nfoolishly ask stupid questions like who\nsent him or that he was there to kill\nhim. Instead, he calmly met the man in\nblack's gaze while simultaneously\noffering a faint compliment. \"Not bad,\nbut it's a pity you didn't kill me the\nfirst time. Now you've missed your\nchance.\" The man in black remained\nsilent, a flicker of doubt crossing his\nsharp eyes, but it quickly vanished.\nSeeing this, we wu also felt a sense of\ndoubt. Is this person silence due to\ntheir cold nature? Were they worried\nthat speaking might reveal something?\nJust as Wei Woo was speculating, the man\nin black walked towards him with a knife\nin hand. Are you going to make your\nmove? Too bad. As I just said, you've\nmissed your chance. Bang. No sooner had\nhe finished speaking than a gunshot rang\nout like a thunderclap in the room. The\nman in black felt as if something had\nstung him on the left side of his lower\nabdomen. At first, he didn't pay much\nattention since he didn't feel anything\nwrong with his body at the moment. Just\nas he raised the sword to kill Weii Woo,\nhe suddenly felt an itch in his abdomen,\nlike insects crawling on it. Then,\nintense pain suddenly appeared, as if my\nabdomen had suddenly split open. Bang!\nJust as the man in black was wondering\nwhat was going on. Gunshots rang out\nagain. However, Wayi Wu missed this\ntime. He originally intended to hit the\nheart, but the shot grazed the arm\ninstead. At this moment, the man in\nblack realized that he had kicked a\nsteel plate. He watched as Wei Woo\npulled a dark object from his pocket and\npointed it at him. The man in black\nunderstood that this was what had caused\nhim to get hurt. Although he didn't know\nwhat it was, he was certain that another\nhit would kill him. So before Wei Wu\ncould fire, the man in black, enduring\nthe excruciating pain, leaped out of the\nwindow. Weii Wu watched helplessly as\nhis opponent fled, but had no intention\nof getting up to give chase because it\nwas uncertain whether the other party\nmight be hiding outside waiting for an\nopportunity to strike. And the man in\nblack was too skilled in combat. If I\nlet him get close to the window, I might\nnot even have time to fire a shot. Only\nafter confirming that no one was outside\nthe window did Way Woo finally breathe a\nsigh of relief, but anger followed. I'm\nknown for my compassionate heart, yet\nsomeone still wants to kill me. Fine,\nlet's have some fun then. As he spoke,\nWayi Wu coldly took out a blast helmet,\na bulletproof vest, and a metal blast\nshield from the warehouse. Not content\nwith arming himself to the teeth, he\nalso took out an M4 A1, and four\nmagazine from the warehouse. Today I'll\nshow you what an M4A1 Bodhis Sutva is. A\n5.56 mm 6oot purification bullet with\ngreat compassion to save all beings.\nMuttering something to himself, Wayi Wu\nheld a metal riot shield in his left\nhand and an automatic rifle in his\nright. Bang. He kicked open the door and\nstroed out. Chapter 46 M4A1\nBodus Sutva 5.56 millime 6 roots\npurification bullet great compassion to\nsave all beings after leaving the room\non the second floor Wu went straight to\nthe railing and looked down the guests\nwho had come to watch the spectacle had\nlong since disappeared and even the\nmadam of Mayan Tower had vanished\nwithout a trace. Only a dozen or so\nImperial guards remained alive in the\nhall, each hiding behind cover. Apart\nfrom them, all the remaining Imperial\nGuard were killed by crossbow bolts, but\nJean Hao survived. However, he wasn't in\ngood condition either with an arrow\nstuck in the part of his arm where it\nconnected to his shoulder. Upon seeing\nWei Wu emerge from the room, Jehoa's\nexpression changed drastically with\nanxiety. It's over. Something's happened\nto young Master Wei. Because the\nsituation below was dangerous, many of\nhis own brothers have been killed. Jean\nHao was preoccupied with preventing the\nenemy from breaching the defenses. So he\nfailed to notice the situation on the\nsecond floor. As a result, Weii Wu did\nnot appear, nor did his five brothers.\nThen a strange man walked out of that\nroom. In this situation, Jean Ha&lt;unk&gt;s\nfirst reaction was naturally that Wei Wu\nhad already been murdered. In Jean Ha's\nheart, Weii Wu&lt;unk&gt;s life was more\nimportant than his own. He can die and\nthe other Imperial guards can die. As\nlong as we Woo is safe, nothing will\nhappen. But now that Way Wu is dead,\nthese Genui imperial guards are to blame\nand her families might even be\nimplicated. In an instant, despair\nspread through Jean Hao's heart, and the\nlong knife in his hand clattered to the\nground. The Imperial Guard around them\nturned to look, puzzled as to what was\nwrong with Jean Hao. The crisis outside\nhas not yet been resolved. So why did\nJon Hao throw away the knife in his\nhand? Just as everyone was wondering,\nWayi Wu, who was standing on the second\nfloor, suddenly spoke up. Jean Ha, pick\nup the knife. Do you hear me? Pick up\nthe knife. After saying that, Wayi Wu\npicked up the metal ride shield and ran\ndown from the second floor on Jang\nHa&lt;unk&gt;s side. Hearing Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s\nvoice was like seeing the dawn in the\ndarkness. His eyes were fixed on a man\nin black running towards him. Jean Hao\nonly breathed a sigh of relief when we\nwu came up to him and removed his mask.\nYoung Master Way, why did you come down\nhere? Why didn't those bastards stop\nyou? It's dangerous here. Hurry up and\ngo back upstairs to hide. After\nspeaking, Jeang Hao looked around,\nalready preparing to select people to\nescort Wei Wu upstairs. But at this\nmoment, Wei Wu spoke up. Someone broke\ninto the room just now and killed all\nfive of my brothers. I came down here to\navenge them. Upon hearing that his five\nbrothers had died, Jean Hao sighed\ninwardly. But now is not the time to\nworry about that. The most important\nthing is to protect Weii Wu&lt;unk&gt;s\nsafety. So after Wei Wu finished\nspeaking, he immediately grabbed Weii\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s shoulder, preparing to\npersonally escort him to a different\nhiding place. Before he could make a\nmove, Wayi Wu broke free from Jean Ho's\ngrasp. I told you I came down here to\navenge them. Jean Hao was so anxious he\nwas about to cry, and he even began to\nresent Wei Woo in his heart. You're a\nyoung master. You should have stayed\nhidden. Why did you come down here to\njoin in the fun? If we die, we die. But\nif you die, our whole family will\nsuffer. Can't we just follow\ninstructions at a time like this? Do you\nonly feel happy when you've killed us\nall? These were all Jeang Ha&lt;unk&gt;s\ninnermost thoughts, but he couldn't say\nthem out loud. He could only suppress\nhis frustration and try his best to\npersuade Wei Woo with gentle words.\nYoung Master Wei, you are of noble\nstatus and highly regarded by his\nmajesty. You must not be harmed under\nany circumstances. We cannot bear the\nresponsibility. Please have some\nunderstanding for us brothers. I Jean Ha\nand my brothers are begging you. Please\njust hide. Having said all that, we wu\nunderstood what Jeang Hao was thinking.\nHowever, he couldn't explain much to\nJean Hao because even if he did, they\nwouldn't understand. Since reasoning\ndoesn't work, let's prove it with\nactions. Having made up his mind, Wei Wu\ndid not hesitate at all and walked\ntowards the gate with his metal riot\nshield in hand. As soon as he appeared,\nhe heard the sound of a bow string\nsnapping, followed by more than a dozen\narrows flying towards him. Knock-knock\nknock. A series of impact sounds\nemanated from the metal blast shield.\nFortunately, the metal riot shield was\nlarge enough to completely shield Weii\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s body from behind. This volley\nof arrows did not harm him at all.\nInstead, it allowed him to see the\nsituation outside. A total of 15 people,\neight in front and seven in back, all\nholding bows and crossbows, lined up a\ndozen meters outside the gate. A volley\nof arrows had just been fired, and now\nsome people were reloading their\ncrossbows. Seeing this, Wayi Wu\nimmediately realized that his chance to\nmake a move had come. However, at that\nmoment, Jehoa suddenly rushed up to him\nand grabbed his hand. Young Master Wei,\nplease stop this nonsense. The lives of\nmy entire family are at stake. Before\nJean Hao could finish speaking, Wei Wu\nturned around and interrupted him. Jean\nHao, trust me this once, seeing Wayi\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s determined gaze, Jehoa slowly\nclosed his eyes and said nothing more.\nThen Wei Wu spoke again. Hold the shield\nfor me. I'll take care of those guys\noutside. After speaking, Wayi Wu handed\nthe riot shield to Jang Hao and adjusted\nhis posture, pointing his gun outwards.\nJean Hao didn't know what we woo was\ntrying to do, but he could only hold\nonto the shield tightly to protect Wei\nWu. Just then, a spark finally flew from\nthe muzzle of the M4A1. After a gunshot,\na series of explosions like firecrackers\nfollowed. Da da. bullets shot out from\nthe muzzle and instantly struck the\nassassins carrying crossbows. Waywood\nplayed with guns at a shooting range\nbefore and knew the basic shooting\nmovements, but his marksmanship was\nrather poor. Fortunately, these\nassassins were only a dozen meters away\nfrom him, so he didn't need to aim at\nthem. Wayiw simply held his automatic\nrifle and fired back and forth in that\ndirection. After firing a magazine, he\nimmediately pulled out a new magazine,\nloaded it, and continued firing. After\ntwo rounds, fewer than three people were\nleft standing outside the door. The\nothers have been riddled with bullets.\nThe three remaining people were also\ncompletely bewildered, having no idea\nwhat had happened. While they were still\nin a days, Wayi Wu walked out from\nbehind the riot shield with an automatic\nrifle in hand. Upon seeing this, the\nthree immediately raised their crossbows\nand prepared to fire. However, they were\nunaware that we woo had already loaded a\nthird magazine. six 5.56\nmillimeters purification bullets with\ngreat compassion to save all beings. I\nwill send you to the afterlife today. No\nsooner had the words left his mouth and\nthe flames from the muzzle of the M for\na one burst forth once more with a\nfiring rate of 10 bullets per second. It\nonly takes 3 seconds to empty 30\nbullets. When the gunshot went out, the\noutside world had become a place where\nall beings were equal. Jean Hao, who was\noriginally full of complaints, froze on\nthe spot when he saw this scene. He\ncouldn't understand how Wei Woo had done\nit and could only stare dumbfounded at\nthe corpses. If someone is near him,\nthey can hear him talking. Your majesty,\nyou think too highly of us. Young Master\nWei is so capable. He doesn't need\nanyone else to protect him. Jean Hao\nstood behind Wei Wu, muttering to\nhimself, unaware that someone else was\nhiding in the shadows. Call out. A\nwhooshing sound suddenly rang out and an\narrow shot out from the shadows.\nStriking way woo precisely in heart.\nChapter 47. Overcoming the crisis. News\nof Shunlin. Quiet. Dead silence. Jean Ha\nnever expected that there would be an\nassassin lurking in the shadows under\nsuch circumstances. However, it was too\nlate to know now. Being shot in the\nheart by an arrow mint certain death.\nJust as Jean Hao was at a loss, Weii Wu\nmade his move. Instead of falling to the\nground after being shot by an arrow, he\ntook off running for his life. He\nquickly ran behind Jean Hao and hid his\nbody behind a riot shield. Damn. Thank\ngoodness I was wearing a bulletproof\nvest or I'd be dead. Sure enough,\nshowing off never ends well. It must be\nadmitted that the assassin's arrow was\nextremely accurate, hitting Wei Woo\nright in the heart. But Weii Woo was\nwearing a bulletproof vest, which could\nstop bullets, let alone arrows from a\nmere crossbow. Moreover, the chest area\nis the most protective part of a\nbulletproof vest, so it couldn't harm\nWei Woo in the slightest. The man hiding\nin the shadows realized he had failed to\nkill Weii Wu. So, he immediately threw\ndown his bow and crossbow and turned to\nflee. Although he moved quickly, Wei Wu\nstill saw it. The guy hiding in the\nshadows is the man in black who just\ntried to assassinate him in the room. To\nbe honest, Wayi Wu is still a little\nscared now. Not because of that hidden\narrow. What surprised him was that this\nman in black, despite being shot twice,\nstill dared to lurk near May Yanlu. He\nwas glad that he hadn't gone to the\nwindow to check the situation while he\nwas in the room. Back then, there were\nno protective measures in place, and\nanyone who got close would be instantly\nkilled by the men in black. Just as Wei\nWu was sighing, Jean Hao also came to\nhis senses. Chase him. We must catch\nthat assassin. At Jean Ha&lt;unk&gt;s command,\nhalf of the remaining dozen or so\nImperial guards immediately set out in\npursuit. The rest of the people\nsurrounded Wayi Woo, protecting him in\nthe middle. Young Master Way, let's\nescort you back first. We're\nshort-handed right now, and you'll be in\ngreat danger if the enemy has any backup\nplans. Then escorted by Jean Hao, the\ngroup headed towards Weii Wu&lt;unk&gt;s\nresidence. In the Ming Dynasty, a curfew\nwas in effect at night and no one was\nallowed to wander the streets at night.\nEven in places like brothel, it's only\nlively inside. No one comes out.\nOtherwise, if the patrol personnel catch\nthem, they will be punished with dozens\nof lashes at best and beaten to death as\ncriminals at worst. So, even though so\nmany people had just died, no one came\nto watch the spectacle. After leaving\nMayan building, the group walked through\nthe dark and quiet streets. Because it\nwas so dark, we wu and his men were in a\nhurry and had no lighting tools.\nFortunately, Weii Wu had something on\nhand. He took out a powerful flashlight.\nSnap! A strong white light shone from\nthe flashlight, and the dark street was\nno longer an obstacle for them. However,\nthe group had not gone far when they\nheard a series of rapid footsteps in the\ndistance. Upon hearing this commotion,\nJang Ha&lt;unk&gt;s face darkened and he\nimmediately ordered everyone to stand in\nfront of Wei Wu. Not long after, a group\nof soldiers came running out from around\nthe corner. Who dares to violate curfew?\nSurrender immediately. Upon seeing Weii\nWu and his men, the leading soldier\nroared angrily and drew his sword, ready\nto attack. Jean Hao, who had been\nextremely nervous, breathed a sigh of\nrelief upon hearing the angry shout.\nFrom what they said, we could tell they\nwere soldiers from the Five Cities\ngarrison. Jean Hao immediately replied\nloudly. Don't make a move. We are from\nthe Ilwan Division and are on a mission.\nThis is our token. After saying that,\nJean Ha took out the token from his\npocket and threw it in front of the\ngroup of soldiers. Although the\nembroidered uniform guard has been\nestablished, it has not yet been\npublicly announced. So Jean Hao refers\nto himself as the director of the\nImperial Guard. So your brother's from\nthe Ewan division. Since you're on a\nmission, we won't disturb you any\nlonger. After a careful inspection, it\nwas confirmed that there was nothing\nwrong with the token, and the soldiers\nimmediately let him through. At this\npoint, Jangha could have easily asked\nthe soldiers to help escort Wei Wu. But\nafter what just happened, Jean Hao no\nlonger dared to trust anyone else. If\nthe enemy can even get their hands on\nweapons and crossbows, who knows what\nother means they might have. Weii\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s safety is paramount. At this\ntime, only his own people can be\ntrusted. After dealing with the five\ncities garrison, Weii Wu and his men\ntraveled without hindrance. The group\nquickly returned to the mansion. After\nsending Wei Wu to the hospital, Jang Hao\nfinally felt relieved. Young Master Wei,\nwe are short-handed right now. I will\nsend someone back to the garrison to\ncall for more men. For your safety,\nplease try to stay awake and not fall\nasleep until our people arrive.\nFurthermore, I will immediately send\nsomeone to inform his majesty about what\njust happened and to strengthen the\ndefenses here. Actually, Jean Hao had no\nchoice but to ask Wei Woo for his\ncooperation. After all that has happened\ntonight, what if the other party really\nhas other tricks up their sleeve?\nTherefore, Weii Wu needs to remain\nclear-headed to better cooperate with\nthem in protecting him. Weii Wu wasn't\nstupid. He understood what Jeang Ho\nmeant as soon as he finished speaking.\nWhen it comes to his own safety, he\nnaturally wouldn't let his guard down.\nHowever, Wayiu also had his own ideas\nabout the matter concerning Old Ju. Jean\nHao, don't send anyone to his majesty's\nside for now. Too many things have\nhappened these past few days. Let his\nmajesty rest well. I plan to go to the\npalace tomorrow. I'll just tell his\nmajesty about tonight's events\ntomorrow.\" Upon hearing Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s\nwords, Jean Ha was momentarily unsure\nwhether he should agree. After all, this\nmatter was too serious, and concealing\nit would be a grave crime. But he dared\nnot disobey Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s orders. Seeing\nJean Ha&lt;unk&gt;s hesitant expression, Wei\nWu reached out and patted him on the\nshoulder. Don't worry, I'll explain that\nit was my request and his majesty won't\npunish them. Just like Shin Lin and the\nothers, it was I who pleaded for them.\nSeeing that way, Wu had gone this far.\nJean Hao had no choice but to nod in\nagreement. However, Jean Hao is somewhat\npuzzled when he heard Weii Wu&lt;unk&gt;s last\nwords. Young Master Wei, you said you\npleaded for Shan Lin and the others.\nYes, I pleaded with his majesty and he\nagreed to give them to me so that they\ncould help me guard my house from now\non. After saying that, Wayi Wu asked\nanother question. Oh, by the way, do you\nknow what Shinllin and the others are up\nto? It's been 2 days. Why haven't they\ncome looking for me yet? Jean Hao knew\nthat Shan had made a mistake and was\nthrown in a death row, but he didn't\nknow the details. They had no idea what\nhappened after Shan was thrown in a\ndeath row. His orders were to protect\nWei Wu, and even if they all died, they\ncould not let anything happen to Wei Wu.\nIt wasn't until Wei Wu said it himself\nthat he realized Shinllin had been\npardoned by the emperor and had given to\nWei Wu. As for the veracity of this\nnews, Jean Hao had no doubt about it\nwhatsoever. Given the emperor's high\nregard for Wei Wu, this matter would be\ninsignificant if he simply spoke up.\nHowever, since Weii Wu mentioned\nShunllin, Jean Hao also thought of Shan\nLllin&lt;unk&gt;s current situation. Young\nMaster Way, it's not that Shin Lin and\nthe others aren't coming to find you.\nIt's just that they're still locked up\nin jail. Upon hearing Jean Ha&lt;unk&gt;s\nanswer, Wayi Wu immediately frowned.\nWhat? His majesty has already pardoned\nhim, so why is he still imprisoned?\nChapter 48. Jang Hao in a dilemma.\nShanun Lin in trouble. Hearing Wei\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s question, Jean Hao also felt\nsomewhat helpless. Young Master Wei, the\nprison is not under my jurisdiction, so\nI'm not very clear about it. Ha could\ntell that Way Wu cared a lot about this\nmatter. So he continued, \"Here's what\nwe'll do. When the brothers from the\ngarrison arrive, you can rest first, and\nI'll go back to the garrison to inquire\nfor you.\" Seeing Jean Ha's shoulder\nstained with blood and the arrow still\nlodged in his hand, Wayi Wu decisively\nshook his head. So many of his brothers\ndied and he himself was injured with\nhalf his body stained with blood. At a\ntime like this to have someone run\naround asking around for information.\nOnly a heartless person would do\nsomething like that. Never mind. You\nshould treat your injuries first. We can\ndeal with Shan Lllin's matter tomorrow.\nThere's no rush. Hearing Weii Wu&lt;unk&gt;s\nreply, Jean Hao breathed a sigh of\nrelief. Admittedly, the arrow wound\nwasn't fatal, but it really hurt when\nsomething like that was stuck in his\nskin. After struggling to stay afloat\nfor so long, he honestly felt he was\nabout to give up. However, just as Jean\nHao turned around to go get treatment, a\ngroup of people walked in through the\ncourtyard gate. Upon closer inspection,\nit turned out to be the same group that\nhad chased after the man in black.\nSeeing them return, Zang Hao,\ndisregarding his injuries, immediately\nasked, \"Well, have you caught that man\nin black yet? We lost them.\" The leader\nof the Imperial Guards shook his head\nwith a somber expression. Upon hearing\nthis answer, Jean Ha&lt;unk&gt;s anger surged\nup immediately. That man in black was\nclearly injured. How could we lose track\nof him even following the trail of\nblood? Sensing the reproach in Jang\nHa&lt;unk&gt;s tone, the leader of the\nImperial Guards felt wronged. Boss, we\ndidn't want this either. That guy is\nvery skilled and knows the streets of\nthe capital very well. We chase him all\nthe way to the Chin Hawaii River,\nintending to take action, but\nunexpectedly he turned around and jumped\ninto the river. We search along the\nshore for a long time, but couldn't find\nhim coming ashore. We only came back to\nreport to you because we couldn't find\nhim anywhere. Wayi Wu had personally\nencountered the man in black and knew\nhow formidable he was. So, after this\nperson finished speaking, he chimed in\nwith a comment. That guy is really\npowerful. He broke into the room and\nkilled those five brothers in an\ninstant. If it weren't for my abilities,\nI would probably be dead by his hand\nlong ago. This man is extremely\ndangerous. Hearing Wei Wu say this, Jean\nHa could no longer reprimand his\nsubordinates. However, at this moment,\nthe leader of the Imperial Guard spoke\nup again. Actually, it wasn't entirely\nfruitless this time. At least I\ndiscovered a few issues while pursuing\nhim. Boss, as you know, I have a\nnaturally more sensitive sense of smell\nthan others, and I can smell very subtle\nscents. When I follow that person, I\ncould always smell a stench of urine.\nAnd what was even stranger was that it\nwas mixed with the smell of spices. The\nsmell of urine mixed with the smell of\nspices. Upon hearing this answer, both\nWei Wu and Jean Hao frowned. Neither of\nthese two scents were particularly\nnoteworthy in the Ming dynasty. Scholars\nand literati would typically carry\nsachets or similar items. It's not\nsurprising that it smells like urine.\nIt's just spices combined with the smell\nof urine. It would be very strange if\ntwo different smells appeared on one\nperson at the same time. Firstly,\nscholars are unlikely to possess such\nskills. Secondly, martial artists\ndislike affeminite men and would not\ncarry sachets with them. Furthermore,\neven if there's an oddball who practices\nmartial arts and likes to carry around\nthese kinds of things, but he came to\nassassinate someone, wasn't he afraid of\nbeing exposed by carrying something with\nsuch a strong odor? Unless the person\ndoesn't actually carry it, but simply\ncarries a sache with them all the time.\nThere was a lingering fragrance on him,\nbut he had gotten used to it and didn't\nnotice it. So, here's the question. He\npracticed martial arts, always carried a\nsache, and also smelled of urine. What\nkind of person meets these three\nconditions? The only thing we woo could\nthink of was Unix. That's right. After\ncastration, Unix are physically\nincomplete and are prone to\nincontinence. To mask the smell, they\nwould carry sachets with them year\nround. Moreover, Unix were allowed to\npractice martial arts. Given Wei Wu's\nprevious speculations about the\nassassination attempt, the possibility\nof a unic is even greater. If Crown\nPrincess Lu is indeed the person behind\nit all, then the logic is complete and\neverything makes sense. In fact, it\nwasn't just Weii Wu who thought of this.\nEven Jean Hao thought of it. However, he\nonly speculated based on the taste.\nUnlike Wei Wu who used logical\nreasoning. However, after coming to this\nconclusion, he felt a little panicked.\nThe fact that they were able to send\nUnix to commit murder must have been\nclosely related to the imperial palace.\nCurrently, the only certainty is that\nthis unic was not sent by the emperor.\nsuch trouble. Aside from the emperor,\nthere were practically no other people\nin the palace who could command Unix.\nHow could a lowly imperial guard like\nhim not panic when he got involved in\nsomething like this? Just as Jean Ha was\nfeeling troubled, we wu spoke up. Let's\nput the matter of the man in black aside\nfor now. If he jumps into the water, the\nsmell on him will be washed away. He\nwill definitely hide away to treat his\ninjuries. The capital is so big. It's\nlike looking for a needle in a hay stack\nto find him again. Once the people from\nthe garrison arrive, let the brothers\nrest first and also make proper\narrangements for the dead. Upon hearing\nWeii Wu&lt;unk&gt;s words, Jean Hao felt the\nweight on his heart immediately\ndisappear. He really didn't want to\ninvestigate the matter of the man in\nblack, but he had to investigate because\nof his duty. But if we Wu said it, then\nhe wouldn't be in a difficult position.\nIn fact, Weii Wu was unaware of Jean\nHa's worries, but he genuinely wanted to\nhelp Zang Hao out of his predicament. If\nhis guess is correct, the man in black\nwill inevitably involve Crown Princess\nLu. Only someone of Maang's rank could\nguarantee that nothing would happen to\nmatters involving royal privacy. Jean\nHao and his ilk, even if they were only\nslightly involved, could be torn to\npieces. Weii Wu took the initiative to\nremove them from the group as a way of\nrepaying them for their desperate\nprotection. Tonight, just as the group\nwas talking, the Imperial guards who had\ncome from the garrison arrived. With\nWayi Wu&lt;unk&gt;s safety assured, Jean Hao\nwas finally able to relax and treat his\narrow wound. After Jean Hao left, Weii\nWu first went to visit Zu Yuan and Ching\nXia. However, the two little girls were\nalready asleep, so there was no need to\nwake them up. After confirming that the\ntwo were unharmed, Wayi Wu went back to\nhis room to rest. Night fades and dawn\nbreaks. The next morning, Wayi Wu got\nout of bed very early. Before Doraba\neven arrived, he had already dressed and\nwashed up. Today, I'm going to Cunning\nPalace to deliver the medicine for\ntreating smallpox to Empress Ma. Also, I\nneed to tell Liao Zu about what happened\nlast night since it involved his\ndaughter-in-law. However, before Wayi Wu\ncould even step out, he saw Jean Hao\nwith bandages wrapped around his wounds\nrushing in from outside the courtyard\ngate. Young Master Way, I have found out\nabout Shan Lin, but his current\nsituation is not very good. Chapter 49,\nSecret Technique, the thousand-year kill\nwith the electric batten. Although\nShinllin and the others were thrown into\ndeath row, they were not convicted and\nwere just awaiting their fate. Since old\nJew handed the people over to him, he\ncertainly wouldn't convict Shan and the\nothers again. At most, the day spent in\njail are unpleasant. How could he be in\na dangerous situation? Upon hearing Jean\nHa&lt;unk&gt;s words, Wayi Wu couldn't help\nbut slowly frown. What happened to\nShunlin and the others? Jean Hao sighed\nsoftly, then explained, \"Shanlin has a\nsworn enemy named Xiang Wan. That guy is\na captain, a higher ranking officer than\nShanlin, and he always causes trouble\nfor him. It's just that we haven't had\nthe opportunity before. This time,\nShanllin was thrown into a death row\ncell, and that place just happens to be\nunder Shiong Wind's jurisdiction. If I\nhadn't gone back to the garrison to\ninquire about the situation, I wouldn't\nhave known that Shan Lin had already\nbeen tortured by him in the death row\nfor 2 days. Upon hearing this, Wayi Wu\nnarrowed his eyes slightly and then\nspoke directly. Jang Hao, take me to\nyour embroidered uniform guard prison.\nJang Hao did not hesitate and\nimmediately led Wei Wu to the prison.\nMeanwhile, at the Genui prison, Shun\nLinn hung his head, his clothes\ntattered, and was bound to the rack,\ncold chains wrapped around his limbs.\nHis body was covered in wounds, and his\nwhite undershirt was stained red with\nblood seeping from his wounds. In\naddition, standing opposite him was a\nman with a pointed mouth and monkeyike\nface. This man was Shiong. Xiangwin\ngrinned maliciously, holding a leather\nwhip in his hand, and stared at Shunlin\nwith cruel eyes. Shunlin, this whip\ntastes good, doesn't it? After waiting\nfor so long, you've finally fallen into\nmy hands. Back then, you reported my\nbrother-in-law, causing him to be\narrested and imprisoned. Did you ever\nthink that you would end up like this\nyourself? As Shan spoke, Shan Lin slowly\nraised his head. However, due to his\nphysical injuries, even the simplest\nmovements caused him immense pain.\nHowever, even though the excruciating\npain made his muscles twitch, he didn't\nutter a single groan. When Shinllin\nlooked at Xiang Wan, his eyes were full\nof contempt, and he even made sarcastic\nremarks. The taste, yes, it's not bad,\nbut it's like a woman's. Didn't you eat\nlunch? Just like you, brother-in-law.\nAll you can do is bully bully women.\nSeeing that Shan Lllin still dared to\ninsult him. Shywin's eyes immediately\nflashed with a fierce light. You're\nstubborn. Very good. I like your\nstubbornness. Let's see if you're still\nstubborn after I soaked this whip in\nsalt water. No sooner had he finished\nspeaking than someone brought Shiang\nwhen a plate of salt water. Shiong\nscooped up a handful of salt water with\none hand and splashed it on Shan. Seeing\nthe twitching expression on Shan Lllin's\nface, Xiwin finally dipped the whip into\nthe water with satisfaction. This whip\nis soaked in salt water, so it feels\nreally spicy when it hits Yuhi. As Shyom\nwhen spoke, he pulled the whip out of\nthe basin and then lashed out with it.\nSmack. Previously, Shi would have been\nusing an ordinary whip to slowly torture\nShinllin. But this time, he went all\nout. A whip that has been soaked in\nwater is not only heavier, but the small\nburrs on the whip will also increase\nfriction after they expand. A normal\nperson wouldn't last more than a few\nhits before being knocked unconscious\nfrom the pain. Xiangwin wanted Shunllin\nto scream and whail in front of him, but\nthings didn't go as he wished. The whip\nleft a long bloody welt on Shan Lllin's\nbody. The wound was raw and bleeding\nslowly seeped out, staining a large area\nof the clothes red. The saline solution\nseeped into the wound, causing Shan\nLllin's veins to bulge all over his body\nfrom the pain, but he gritted his teeth\nand endured it, his cheeks bulging high,\nand he didn't even let out a scream, not\nhearing Shan Linn's pitiful howls,\nShiwin's anger flared up instantly. You\nmanaged to hold back, \"He, that's\nimpressive. Let's keep playing then.\" As\nhe spoke, Shan threw the whip into the\nsalt water to soak and then picked up a\nbranding iron. The saltwater whip is too\nheavy. If it kills you, we'll have no\nfun anymore. But this branding iron\nwon't kill you. Shyomwin grinned\nmaliciously and casually placed the\nbranding iron into the charcoal stove.\nIt would take a while for the soldering\niron to heat up, and Shiwin didn't want\nto waste that time. Holding salt water\nin one hand, he would occasionally\nsprinkle a little on Shanlin, which was\nextremely vicious. As time passed, the\nsoldering iron in the charcoal stove\nbecame red-hot. Seeing this, Xiangwin\npicked up the soldering iron and waved\nit back and forth in front of Shinlan.\nWhen this branding iron is heated but\nnot red hot, the pain is mild. When it\nis slightly red, the pain is moderate.\nBut when it is heated to a bright red,\nit is a different story. Getting burned\nby it is excruciatingly painful and it\nwill leave a mark for life. What do you\nthink I should get it? How about my\nface? After saying that, Shanwin pointed\nthe branding iron at Shinl. However, he\ndid not stab directly, but instead\nslowly brought the branding iron closer\nto Shinl. As the saying goes, death is\nnot scary. What's scariest is the\nprocess of waiting to die. This was also\nShiang Wen's purpose, to deliberately\ncreate fear and to torment Shinllin with\na fear in his heart. As the soldering\niron slowly approached, its intense heat\nalso drew ever closer. Shinlin could\nalready smell the charcoal on the\nbranding iron and his hair was curled up\ndue to the high temperature. My cheeks\nstarted to sting from the high\ntemperature. If you move that branding\niron an inch further, I'll shove it up\nyour ass. Just as the branding iron was\nabout to be pressed against Shan Lin's\nface, a cold voice rang out in the\ntorture chamber. Shiwin turned around\nand saw a young man standing at the door\nof the torture chamber, looking at him\nwith icy eyes. That's right. Weii Wu\nfinally arrived at the crucial moment.\nIf he had arrived two seconds later,\nShanllin&lt;unk&gt;s face would probably have\nbeen scalded. Seeing Xiangwin's pointed\nmonkeylike face and Shan Lllin's\nmiserable state, Wayi Wu was furious. I\nhaven't even had a chance to use my men\nyet, and they've been tortured into this\nstate by this son of a At this\nmoment, Wayi Wu even wondered whether he\nshould just shoot Xiang Wan and kill\nhim. But then I felt that was too easy\non him and there was no need to waste a\nbullet on this guy. Since he enjoys\ntorturing people, let him experience\nwhat it's like to be tortured. Just as\nwe made up his mind, Shiwin suddenly\nspoke up. Who are you? Daring to\ntrespass into the Imperial Guards\nprison. We didn't say anything but\nwalked straight towards where Shinllin\nwas tied up. Upon seeing this, Xiangwin\nimmediately dropped the branding iron,\ndrew his long sword and pointed it at\nWei Wu. You've trespassed into the\nprison. I suspect you're trying to break\nme out to die.\" With a loud shout,\nXiangwin charged towards Wei Wu with his\nsword drawn. However, at that moment, a\nfigure rushed into the torture chamber\nand came to Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s side in an\ninstant. Shiangwin didn't even get a\nchance to touch Wei Wu before he was\nkicked away. When he got up, he felt a\nchill on his neck. Turning his head, he\nsaw Jeang how holding a long knife, the\nblade pressed against his neck. Just as\nShiang was about to say something, he\nsuddenly felt a hard stick being pressed\nagainst his buttocks. Then a voice\nfilled with suppressed anger was heard.\nJean Hao put the knife away. Upon\nhearing this, Jean Hao immediately\nsheathed his sword and then saw a flash\nof blue light in the torture chamber. At\nthe same time, a series of crackling and\npopping sounds came from behind. Chapter\n50 talked to me about rules. My rules\nare the rules. The blue light and the\nloud noise lasted for about 3 seconds\nbefore stopping. A delicate flower\nwithered and turned black under the\ncontinuous impact of a strong electric\ncurrent. The owner of the flowers then\ncollapsed to the ground, trembling all\nover. Tie him up with a rope. Weii Wu\ncasually gave an order, put away the\nstun gun, and came to Shinllin. After\ntaking a few steps closer, Shanllin's\nextremely weak voice came through. Young\nMaster Way, what brings you here? Of\ncourse, I came to see you. My yard is\nwaiting for you to come back and guard\nit from me. After Wei Wu finished\nspeaking, Shinllin forced a weak smile\ndespite the excruciating pain. Young\nMaster Way, you just we failed in our\nduty to protect you. How could we\npossibly have the face to return?\nBesides, we are now imprisoned. Don't\nworry, I've already pleaded with his\nmajesty, and he will not pursue your\nresponsibility any further. Before\nShinllin could finish speaking, Weii Wu\nwaved his hand and continued. However,\nfrom now on, you will no longer be Ginui\nImperial Guards. You will have to follow\nme for the rest of your lives and help\nme guard my home. Upon hearing this,\nShunlin managed a weak smile. It is our\nhonor to serve you, young master, and to\nguard your home.\" Shinl knew very well\nthat this was the best way out for him\nand his brothers. Otherwise, given the\nemperor's high regard for Wei Woo, these\npeople would have been exiled far away,\neven if they hadn't died. Fgging,\ncaning, penal servitude, exile, and\ndeath. Exile was the most severe\npunishment below the death penalty. At\nwei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s signal, Jean Hao and\nseveral others took Shenllin down from\nthe rack. The process inevitably\naggravated his wounds, causing Shan to\nturn pale and break out in a cold sweat\nfrom the pain. However, his willpower\nwas truly strong. Even so, he didn't\nutter a single cry of pain. After\nsetting Shinllin down to sit, Weii Wu\nturned to look at Shiong Wan, who had\nalready been tied up. Originally, I\nwanted to see if he had woken up since\nhis recovery time was almost up.\nHowever, the first thing he saw when he\nturned around was that Shiwin's crotch\nwas leaking yellow fluid. Holy crap, did\nthis guy's sphincter get damaged by an\nelectric shock? Why is he producing\nfertilizer? Wayiu was still wondering\nwhether he should avoid it since the\nsmell would start to waft out soon. But\nbefore he could make a decision, Shiom\nhad already opened his eyes. Seeing\nthis, we didn't bother to avoid it\nanymore and looked directly at Shamwan,\nsaying coldly, \"So, your name is\nShamwan, right? You dare to abuse your\npower against my people. You're pretty\narrogant.\" At this point, Shaun also\nguessed that Weii Wu&lt;unk&gt;s identity was\nnot simple, otherwise Jean Ha would not\nhave attacked him. He dared not confront\nWei Woo directly. But with a quick\nglance, he immediately thought of how to\nargue his way out. Young Master Shanlin\nwas sent to the death row by order of\nhis majesty himself. Are you sure he is\none of your men? Weii Wu sneered, then\nsaid, \"His majesty himself pardoned him\nand sent him to me. Tell me, isn't he\none of my men?\" Although it was just a\nsimple sentence, it made Shiang Win's\nheart pound wildly. Even high-ranking\nofficials like commanders of a thousand\nmen within the embroidered uniform guard\nwere not qualified to meet the emperor.\nBut this young master in front of us is\nable to receive a personal reward from\nthe emperor. This clearly shows that\nthis young man is no ordinary person.\nBut now that things have come to this,\nhe has no choice but to bite the bullet\nand try to make up for it. Young master,\nI have not received any imperial order\nto release the prisoners. The use of\ntorture was simply in accordance with\nthe rules. Xiang Win's idea was good and\nhis reasons were also very valid.\nUnfortunately, he was facing Weii Wu, a\nman with whom there was no need to\nreason. Rules? You're talking to me\nabout rules? Huh? Shanlin, do you\nremember how many lashes he gave you? We\nwu stared at Shong Wan and asked a\nquestion without turning his head. Then\nShin Lin said weakly, \"I don't remember.\nMaybe more than 40 lashes.\" \"All right,\n100 lashes it is. If he lashes you a 100\ntimes, I'll repay him tfold. I'll lash\nhim a thousand times. As soon as he\nfinished speaking, everyone around him\nwas stunned. Could it really be done\nlike that? As for Shong Wan, it's\nunclear whether he experienced a stress\nreaction after being electrocuted. Upon\nhearing Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s words, the man was\nso frightened that he broke out in a\ncold sweat and shouted, \"Regardless of\nyour status, the embroidered uniform\nguard is the emperor's personal guard,\nand only his majesty can punish them.\nThen, do I have the right to punish\nyou?\" After Xiang when finished\nspeaking, before Wayi Wu could speak, a\nvoice came from outside the door. When\neveryone turned around, they saw Mao\nXiang, the commander of the embroidered\nuniform guard, standing at the door of\nthe torture chamber. At that moment,\nXiangwin felt as if the sky was about to\ncollapse. It's just Shunlin. First, a\nyoung master appeared, and now even our\nown commander has shown up. Moreover,\nit's obvious that he's on that young\nmaster's side. So, isn't he completely\nruined? However, Maoang didn't even\nglance at Xiwin's despair. He went\nstraight to Wei Wu. Then cupped his\nhands and said, \"Young Master Wei, we\nmeet again. Commander Mao, this is quite\nan honor.\" Weii Wu returned the greeting\nwith clasped hands. And then Mao Xiang\nsaid, \"Young Master Wei, I've looked\ninto this matter. Rest assured, I will\ndefinitely give you an explanation.\"\nAfter saying this, Maang pointed at\nXiang W and turned to his subordinates,\nsaying, \"Since young Master Wei has\nordered a thousand lashes, you shall\nreceive a thousand lashes regardless of\nwhether you live or die. If you receive\none less lash, you shall receive 10\nlashes.\" As soon as Mao Xiang finished\nspeaking, the imperial guards beside him\nrushed forward. Xiaomin couldn't even\nbeg for mercy before his mouth was\ngagged and he was taken away. Only then\ndid Maang turn his head back to look at\nWayi Wu. Prisons are filthy places. I\nhave some good tea. Why don't we come\nover for a cup of tea in a chat? I\nhappen to enjoy drinking tea, but I\ndon't know much about it. I'd be\ngrateful if Commander Mao could teach\nme. Upon hearing that Wayi Wu had given\nhim face, Maang smiled slightly. After\nordering someone to take Shinllin to the\nmedical staff for treatment, Maang\ngestured to Wei Wu to invite him to join\nhim. Upon leaving the prison and\narriving at the guard house hall, the\ntwo had barely sat down when tea was\nserved. Without a doubt, Maang had\narranged it in advance. We picked up the\nteacup and took a sip. The tea was\nmellow, sweet, and had a lingering\naftertaste. It was indeed a fine tea.\nSeeing that we Wu was satisfied with the\ntea, Maang finally spoke. Young Master\nWei, regarding Shunllin's matter, it's\nnot that I'm making things difficult for\nhim. I think there's been a\nmisunderstanding. I haven't received the\nimperial edict. Perhaps too many things\nhave happened recently and the decree\ncouldn't be delivered to me in time.\nHowever, I believe that young master way\nwill not speak recklessly and those\npeople will be released in a while. At\nthis point, Maang suddenly let out a\nlong sigh. Sigh. First, the marquee of\nYong Chong broke into my residence at\nnight. And then there was that incident\nin the palace. I haven't slept a wink\nsince I got so busy. After Mao Xiang\nfinished speaking, we would did not\nthink that it was an excuse. Too many\nthings happened that night. First, Lanu\nfell ill. Then, Zhu Xionging fell ill\nand Emperor's Ma sealed off Kuending\nPalace. Old Ju was extremely anxious, so\nit's normal that insignificant figures\nlike Shenllin were overlooked. However,\nupon hearing Mao Xiang mention matters\nin the palace, Wei Wu asked a question\nout of curiosity. Any progress on the\nsmallox case? Chapter 51. Shan\nLinn&lt;unk&gt;s meritorious service. Key\nevidence chain in the smallox case. It\nwould have been better if he hadn't\nasked that question. As soon as he did,\nMaang sighed with a worried expression.\nThe person infected with smallpox and\nthe palace made Chu Xi were completely\nunrelated. They were complete strangers.\nI originally intended to conduct a\nthorough investigation from Chuni's\nside, but the crown princess sent\nsomeone over to inquire, and her words\nwere full of concern. Upon hearing this,\nwe wu understood Maang&lt;unk&gt;s\npredicament, as it involved the Eastern\nPalace. The crown princess was of noble\nstatus, while Maang was in essence just\na subject. When dealing with matters, it\nis necessary to consider the problem\nfrom multiple perspectives. If Maang\nwere to act recklessly simply because he\nhas the emperor's orders, then his death\nwould be imminent. Looking back at the\ncommanders of the embroidered uniform\nguard throughout history, it's clear\nthat every emperor who was a powerful\nruler. How many of these people got a\ngood ending? They were all thrown out to\ntake the blame. While we was lost in\nthought, Maang continued his story. I\ncouldn't use torture on her, so I could\nonly look for clues in Shuni's house,\nwhich led me to some leads. The clues\nare related to Shan. I came back to find\nhim, but I never expected to run into\nyoung Master Way in a prison. Shan? Upon\nhearing Shan&lt;unk&gt;s name, Wayi Wu\nimmediately inquired, \"Commander Mao, is\nShanlin involved in this case?\" Seeing\nWei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s expression, Maoang knew he\nhad misunderstood. So, he shook his head\nand explained, \"It's not related to\nShinllin, but Shunlin knows a palace\nmade named Chui. They are neighbors.\" I\nrushed back to the garrison after\nfinding this out, hoping to get some\nuseful clues from Shanl. However, for\nnow, we can only trouble young master\nway to give his approval since they are\npeople bestowed upon you by his majesty.\nAfter listening to Maang's words, we\nimmediately picked up his teacup. It's\nall right. I'm quite curious about this,\ntoo. Let's go find Shinllin after we\nfinish our drink. Upon hearing this,\nMaong immediately raised his cup and the\ntwo of them drank the tea in one gulp\nbefore getting up. Logically, Shanllin\nshould have been sent over, but he is\ncurrently seriously injured, making it\ninconvenient for him. Weii Wu suggested\ngoing to find Shanlin because he was\nsomewhat protective of his own. But\nfortunately, Maoang wasn't such a\nstickler for rules. The two then went to\nShanllin's side where a medic was\napplying medicine to him. Strangely,\nwhile applying the medicine, Shanun kept\nhis eyes fixed on a room not far away.\nThey didn't even see Weii Wu and Maang\narrive. Seeing this, Wei Wu stepped\nforward with some curiosity and asked in\na low voice, \"Shunllin, is there a\npretty girl in that room? You seem so\nmesmerized.\" Upon hearing Weii Wu&lt;unk&gt;s\nvoice, Shunlin snapped out of his days\nand scratched his head somewhat\nawkwardly. \"Young Master Wei, please\ndon't laugh at me. How could there\npossibly be any pretty girls in the\nembroidered uniform guard? After saying\nthat, Shunlin then explained, \"I wasn't\nlooking at the girl. I was looking at\nthe patient in that room.\" \"The patient?\nWhat happened to that patient?\" Before\nWei Wu could even speak, Shinllin had\njust finished speaking when Maang spoke\nup first to ask a question. It's not\nsurprising that he was so agitated. The\npeople in that room were very important\nbecause that person was the only patient\nin the entire capital city infected with\nsmallox. This person was likely related\nto the crown prince's smallox infection,\nwhich made Maoang take the matter\nseriously. Upon hearing Mao Xangs voice,\nShunlin realized that there was another\nperson behind Wei Wu. As a former junior\nofficer of the embroidered uniform\nguard, Shan Lin subconsciously prepared\nto salute Maang. Then it suddenly\noccurred to him that he was no longer a\nmember of the embroidered uniform guard\nbut was now working for young master\nway. Therefore, after Maang finished\nspeaking, he simply bowed and replied,\n\"I've met this man before, and he's very\nlikely connected to my neighbor's\ndeath.\" After Shin Lin finished\nspeaking, Maang became even more\nexcited. \"The neighbor you mentioned, is\nhe surnamed Wong, the one who just died\nnot long ago?\" Yes, commander. Mao made\nyou aware of this matter as well.\nShinlin looked at Maang with curiosity.\nLogically speaking, all murder cases in\nthe countryside should be investigated\nby the Intion Prefecture government.\nThis kind of thing doesn't need the\nembroidered uniform guard to get\ninvolved, let alone a big shot like Mao\nXang, who is a commander. However, just\nas Shinllin was wondering, Maang walked\ndirectly in front of him. Shinlin, tell\nme in detail about your neighbor and\nthis person. Seeing that Maian&lt;unk&gt;s\nexpression was a bit off, Shinllin\ncouldn't help but turn to look at Wayi\nWu. Only after seeing Wayi Wu nod did he\nslowly speak. My neighbor is a gambling\naddict. Whenever he loses gambling, he\ngoes home and takes it out on his wife\nand children. And he doesn't know how to\ncontrol himself. We neighbors couldn't\nstand by and watch, but we couldn't\ninterfere in other people's family\naffairs. So, we could only bring some\nfood to the children when he was not\naround. Once a gambling addict found his\nchild eating and insisted that his wife\nwas hiding money from him and that he\nwas beating her at home. His wife\ncouldn't take it anymore and eventually\nhanged herself at home. Poor Chui. She\nlost her mother at such a young age. As\na result, that beast even went after\nChui. In order to get money to gamble,\nhe actually sold her to the palace as a\nslave. After listening to Shan Lynn's\ndescription, Weii Wu and Mao Xiang\nexchanged a glance and simultaneously\nnoticed a problem. Chuni left the palace\nto attend her father's funeral. But the\nquestion is, was her father worth doing\nthis? Palace maids in the Ming dynasty\ndid not have the right to leave the\npalace. Once you enter the palace, you\ncan forget about ever leaving without\nthe emperor's pardon. He sought out the\ncrown princess for a chance to leave the\npalace because of someone who had abused\nhim since childhood and even driven his\nmother to her death. This is utter\nnonsense. However, if Chui had other\npurposes for leaving the palace, then\nthis would be perfectly reasonable.\nThinking of this, Wayi Wu turned his\ngaze to the room where the smallox\npatient was being held. Tell me about\nthis person. Why do you say he's\nconnected to your neighbor's death? Upon\nhearing this, Shinlin immediately spoke\nup. Young Master Way, as you know, my\nneighbor is a gambling addict and his\nrelatives and friends have long since\nstopped associating with him. I was\ngetting ready to go on my business trip\nthat day when I saw this guy as soon as\nI stepped out the door. He actually went\ninto that gambling addict's house. I\nfound it strange at the time. Wasn't\nthis person afraid of being entangled by\na gambling addict? But I was in a hurry\nto get to work, so I only glanced at him\nfor a few moments before leaving. Who\nknew that when I got home the next\nmorning, I heard from the neighbors that\nthe gambling addict had died at home.\nAfter Shin Lin finished speaking, before\nMaang could speak, Wayi Wu asked another\nquestion. Do you know how that gambling\naddict died? And how long ago was it? I\ndidn't ask for details. Shunlin shook\nhis head, then continued. It's been\nabout 10 days. At this point, Wayi Wu\nalready had a general idea in his mind.\nJust as he was combing his hair, Maoang\nsuddenly spoke up. Young Master Way,\ndoes the incubation period you mentioned\nbefore match this timeline? Yes, if it's\nmore than 10 days, then that coincides\nperfectly with the incubation period and\nthe onset period. Upon hearing we ws\nreply, Maang immediately cupped his\nhands and said, \"Young Master Wei, Maang\nowes you a favor. I need to go to the\npalace to see the emperor immediately,\nand Shanun will probably have to come\nwith me. It's all right. I also have\nsomething to do at the palace, so you\ncan take me in.\" In that case, let's\ntravel together. Chapter 52. Medicine\npresented at Cunning Palace. Empress Ma\nopens hearts and recognizes relatives.\nAfter the two made their decision, Maang\nled the three of them to the palace.\nHowever, Maoang and Shinllin went to\nFunian Hall to find old Jew while Wei Wu\ncame to Cunning Palace first. As before,\nCunning Palace was still surrounded by\nUnix and palace maids. Most of the\npalace staff stood still at the outer\ngate while only a few palace maids\ncarried mugwart leaves and fumigated the\npalace. This is a rule in the palace. In\nthe event of a serious illness, mudwart\nleaves will be burned to ward off evil\nspirits and prevent the spread of\nplague. Weii wus arrival did not attract\nthe attention or obstruction of these\npalace servants. The unix and palace\nmaids witnessed Wu's solo entry into\ncunning palace last time. Upon seeing\nWeii Wu arrive, a unic immediately\ntrotted up to him. Young Master Wei, are\nyou here to request an audience with her\nmajesty the empress? Yes, thank you for\nyour trouble, father-in-law. I wouldn't\ndare. Young Master Way, please come with\nme. The unic quickly waved his hand,\nthen led Wei Woo to the gate of Cunning\nPalace. Knock-k knockock. Your majesty,\nyoung master requests an audience. No\nsooner had the unic finished speaking\nthan Empress Ma's voice came from inside\nthe room. Shia Wu is here. Let Xiao Wu\nin quickly. Then the palace gates opened\nand Empress Ma appeared before Wei Wu\nwith a haggarded look on her face.\nSeeing Empress Ma's current state, Weii\nWu sighed inwardly. The saying, \"The\nhearts of parents are full of love and\nworry for each other,\" applies not only\nto parents, but also to the relationship\nbetween grandparents and grandchildren.\nUpon entering the palace, we casually\nclosed the palace gates before turning\naround and whispering, \"Amma Ma, even if\nyou have to take care of Xianging, you\ncan't neglect your own health.\" Upon\nhearing Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s words, Empress\nMa&lt;unk&gt;s face showed even greater worry.\nAlas, Xiang&lt;unk&gt;s fever has subsided\nthese past few days. But every night, he\nsuffers from unbearable pain and tosses\nand turns, unable to fall asleep. This\nchild is so sensible. He endures the\npain without saying anything so as not\nto worry me. But the more sensible he\nis, the more my heart aches. Smallox\nattacks can indeed cause headaches and\nmuscle and joint pain. Wayi Wu hadn't\nexpected that Zhu Xianging, at only 8\nyears old, could endure such pain. This\nwas simply to avoid worrying Empress Ma.\nTo be honest, he really admired the\nlittle guy. When he was impotent, he was\nin so much pain that he trembled all\nover and would cry out, \"Ouch!\" every\nnow and then. Recalling those unbearable\npast events, Weii Wu quickly shook his\nhead. Looking at Empress Ma again, he\nfound her sitting by the bed wiping Zhu\nXiongy&lt;unk&gt;s cheeks. In fact, seeing\nEmpress Ma's current state, Wei Wu could\nroughly guess the cause of her death. It\nis certain that Empress Ma contracted\nsmallox, but she did not die from it.\nEmpress Ma was already in her 50s and\nher health was in a declining phase of\nher life. In ancient times, hygiene\nconditions and nutritional balance and\ndiet were also inadequate. Zhu Xiang Ing\ncontracted smallox and Empress Ma took\ncare of her day and night. Unable to eat\nor sleep properly, physical fitness and\nimmunity will naturally decline. coupled\nwith the blow of Zhu Xiang Ying&lt;unk&gt;s\ndeath. It can be said that he was\nextremely weak both psychologically and\nphysiologically. It was inevitable that\nshe would be infected with the smallox\nvirus. But unlike Zhu Xionging, Empress\nMa survived. However, her prolonged\nweakness coupled with the smallox virus\ncompletely depleted her body so much so\nthat when she fell ill, she chose not to\ntake medicine. Less Zu Yuan Jang take\nhis anger out on the Imperial physicians\nbecause she understood that her body was\nbeyond medical help. Otherwise, if one\ncould survive, who would want to die?\nThinking of this, Wayi Wu couldn't help\nbut feel deeply moved. Human beings can\nbe powerful in some ways, but they can\nalso be quite weak in others. But now\nthat he's here, all this misfortune will\nbe completely changed. I, we woo, am\ndetermined to save this wise and\nvirtuous empress before me. Even Jesus\ncouldn't save her. And my little\nbrother, the system has said, thinking\nproudly to himself. Weii Wu then looked\ndirectly at Empress Ma and said, \"Auntma\nMa, do you remember when I told you that\nthere was a medicine that could cure\nsmallpox in our time?\" Snap. Empress Ma,\nwho was washing cotton towels, froze\nupon hearing Weii Wu&lt;unk&gt;s words. The\ncotton towel in her hand fell into the\nbasin, splashing water all over the\nfloor. She turned around tremblingly,\nlooking at Wayi Wu with eyes that were a\nmixture of expectation and fear. Why was\nshe timid? because she was afraid her\nexpectations would be dashed.\nFortunately, there is always a way out,\njust as Empress Ma was hoping for it.\nWeii Wu decisively took out a medicine\nbottle and handed it over. Looking at\nthe small white medicine bottle in Wei\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s hand, tears welled up in\nEmpress Ma's eyes in an instant. Xiao\nWu, is this really true? I'm not\ndreaming. There really is hope for\nXianging. Empress Ma trembled as she\ntook the medicine from Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s hand\nand asked a question impatiently. Weii\nWu then gave her an affirmative look.\nDon't worry, Amma Ma. It's true. With\nthis medicine, Xiongying will definitely\nrecover. In the future, he will be able\nto enjoy your company and grow into a\nwise and benevolent ruler of the Ming\ndynasty. Empress Ma gripped the medicine\nbottle tightly, afraid that she might\ndrop it. The worry that had been on his\nface was now replaced by a smile because\nthe future that we wu spoke of was\nexactly the future she longed for. All\nof this can only be achieved through\nthis bottle of medicine in my hand.\nShiao Wu, how should this medicine be\ntaken? Seeing Emperor's Ma's nervous\nexpression towards the medicine bottle,\nWeii Wu smiled slightly and casually\ntook the bottle. He pressed down on the\nbottle cap and slowly rotated it to open\nit, explaining as he demonstrated, \"This\nmedicine is called capsules by us in\nlater generations. There are 42 capsules\nin a bottle. Give Shiang in two capsules\na day. Take one pill with water every 6\nhours. It's best to eat something high\nin fat about the time it takes for an\nincense stick to burn before taking the\nmedicine. It's best to eat some walnuts\nor fish or chicken. Taking it for 14\nconsecutive days should help. Besides, I\nhave some more of this medicine on hand,\nso you don't need to worry about getting\nsick. Hearing Wayi Wu say this, Empress\nMa, who had been worried for several\ndays, was finally able to relax for a\nwhile. She stood up, walked up to Wei\nWu, and gently took his hand. He looked\nat Wayi Wu like a kind and benevolent\nelder. Shiao Wu, you came to the Ming\nDynasty all alone. You seem carefree and\ncynical, but your aunt can sense that\nyou are very lonely. Weii Wu&lt;unk&gt;s\nexpression shifted slightly, but he\nremains silent. Annie hopes that you\nwill treat me as family in the future,\nand I will treat you as my own family in\nreturn. Saving UA and assisting the Ming\ndynasty are just the reasons. But these\nwords are not just for those reasons. Do\nyou understand? We were remained silent\nfor a moment, then raised his head and\ngave a bright smile. Auntie, good boy.\nHearing the word ant, Empress Ma smiled\nhappily and raised her hand to gently\npat Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s head. Did Xiao Chow\nbelieve these words? Believe. Unlike Zhu\nYuan Jang, even after their\nheart-to-heart talk that night, Weii Wu\nonly opened a crack in his heart. For\nWei Wu, Zhu Yuan Jang was more about\nadmiration for the Hong Wu Emperor and\nlove for the Ming Dynasty. But when he\nwas with Empress Ma, he felt as if he\nwere facing a real family member. And\nthis feeling was very comfortable. He\ndidn't know why, but the door opened so\neasily. Looking at the warm smile on\nEmpress Ma's face, Wayi Wu suddenly\nthought a question. If I tell Aunt Ma\nnow that I was bullied and that someone\ntried to kill me last night, what will\nhappen? Thinking of this, Wayi Wu\ncouldn't help but laugh. Chapter 53.\nLeon Chong, who had taken a gunpowder.\nOf course, thinking about it is one\nthing. Laughing about it is another.\nWayi Wu would never actually reveal this\nmatter. Empress Ma was already exhausted\nand haggarded from taking care of Zhu\nXiang Ing day and night. As a junior,\nyou shouldn't bring up such matters and\ncause your elders worry. It's not like\nyou can't handle it yourself. Even if I\ncan't solve it myself, there's still old\nZu, right? He's the one who's going to\nuse the knife. Coming to his senses,\nWayi Wu glanced at Zu Xiang ing lying on\nthe bed and handed the medicine bottle\nback to Empress Ma. Auntie, let someone\nbring him food first. Let Xianging eat\nsomething so we can give him his\nmedicine later. Upon hearing wei\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s reminder, Empress Ma finally\ncame to her senses and immediately gave\ninstructions to the palace made beside\nher. By my order, prepare a meal\nimmediately, including chicken, fish,\nand large dried fruit. Owen. Halfway\nthrough her speech, Empress Ma suddenly\nturned to look at Wayi Wu. Shia Wu, what\ndo you like to eat? Your aunt will have\nthem make it for you. Forehead. To be\nhonest, Wayiu really had no interest in\nthe so-called imperial banquet. In this\nera, besides seafood, which is primarily\nknown for its natural amami flavor,\nthere are other ingredients available.\nThere's probably nothing else that suits\nhis taste. However, since Empress Ma had\nalready spoken, he couldn't refuse, so\nhe just gave a casual reply. I'm not\nvery hungry either. I'll just mooch a\nmeal from UA High School. Empress Ma\nassumed that we woo was just being shy.\nSo after thinking for a moment, she\nordered a dish for him. Your uncle Zu\nespecially likes a certain kind of roast\nduck. And I also think it tastes good.\nSo let's have this one. Roast duck. Yes.\nOld Zu is famously fond of roast duck.\nThe most important thing about this is\nthe heat as well as the ingredients and\ntechniques used for baking. The taste\nwill definitely be excellent. Upon\nhearing Emperor's mom mention this, Wayi\nWu immediately became interested. Okay.\nOkay. Hey, I also want to try the roast\nduck that Uncle Zu likes and see what it\ntastes like. Upon hearing that way, Wu\nwas interested, Empress Ma immediately\nordered people to prepare roast duck.\nNot long after, Zhu Xiong Ying&lt;unk&gt;s\nfood was delivered over. Empress M\ngently woke Zhu Xionging and then fed\nhim food bite by bite. Although Zhu\nXianging was weak, he still looked at\nWayi Wu with curiosity in his eyes. I\ndon't understand how this person is in\nthe Empress Dager's palace and why he's\nsitting there so naturally since he was\nold enough to understand apart from his\ngrandfather. Even his father had never\ndared to be so casual. Seeing Zhu Xiong\nYingy&lt;unk&gt;s curious expression, Weii Wu\nsmiled slightly, got up, and opened the\ntoy box. I took out the toy car from\nlast time, unpacked it, and played with\nit for a while. This caused Zhu Xianging\nto frequently glance at the toy car.\nSeeing this, Wayi Wu went directly to\nthe bedside and placed the toy next to\nhim. Eat well. Take your medicine\nproperly, and when you get better, there\nwill be an even more interesting gift.\nUpon hearing Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s words, Zhu\nXionging nodded and became even more\nobedient while eating. With Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s\nhelp, Empress Ma learned how to take the\ncapsule medicine. Unfortunately, Zhu\nXionging had already finished eating,\nbut Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s roast duck hadn't\narrived yet. Just as he was looking\nforward to it, the Unix's voice came\nfrom outside the door. Your majesty, his\nmajesty has sent me to invite young\nmaster way to the fun hall for a\nmeeting. Upon hearing the unic's\nmessage, we wu slowly shook his head and\nsmiled, realizing he wouldn't be able to\nenjoy the roast duck. Empress Ma\nchuckled softly, then patted Wei Woo on\nthe shoulder. Go ahead. I'll have\nsomeone send the roast duck over to you\nwhen it's ready. After leaving Cunning\nPalace to avoid carrying the virus, Wayi\nWu first went to bathe and change his\nclothes. Only after confirming that\nthere would be no problem did I follow\nthe unic to the function hall. Weii Wu\noriginally thought that Zhu Yuan Jang\nhad summoned him because of the matter\nconcerning the crown princess. When he\narrived at the palace gate, he only saw\nMaang and Shan Linn standing outside the\ngate. But Juu Yuan Jang was nowhere to\nbe seen. The two men didn't dare to\nspeak to Weii Wu, exchange a glance, and\nthen continued to stand with their heads\nbowed. Just as Weii Wu was wondering\nwhat was going on, the unic leading the\nway took him to the back hall. They\nfinally met Zhu Yuan Jang. After\nentering through another gate, beside\nhim were three officials dressed in\ncourt attire. These three are Lie Shan\nChong, Duke of Han, Zang Tai, Minister\nRevenue, and Xiao Jun, Minister Works.\nAs soon as we Wu stepped through the\ngate, the eyes of the three men\nimmediately locked onto him. Xiao Jun\nwas all right, his eyes showing more\ncuriosity, but the Minister of Revenue\nand Lie Shan Chan were different. The\nway they looked at Weii Wu was as if\nthey were looking at a charlatan,\nespecially Lie Shan Chong, whose gaze\nwas quite unfriendly. Weii Wu could\nclearly feel that the air pressure in\nthe room was low, as if it was directed\nat him. He just couldn't understand why\nthose two people were so hostile towards\nhim. However, now is not the time to\nthink about that. With outsiders\npresent, he must first pay his respects\nto the emperor. According to protocol,\nthis humble subject, Wayi Wu, pays his\nrespects to your majesty, the emperor.\nAfter saying this, Wei Wu cuped his\nhands and extended them above his head\nto give Zhu Yuan Jang a respectful bow.\nHowever, after the ceremony, before Wei\nWu could even withdraw his hands, Lishan\nChong started causing trouble, he\nstepped out from among the three,\npointing at Wayi Wu with an unfriendly\nexpression and scolding him. You\naudacious commoner, without any official\nrank or title. Why do you not kneel\nbefore his majesty? We didn't speak just\nlooked at him calmly, but he was puzzled\nin his heart. Who is this old by Deng? I\ndon't even know you. You acted like you\nwere on fire the first time we met.\nSeeing that way Wu ignored him and was\nso frivolous, Lie Shan Chong was even\nmore dissatisfied. He was a high-ranking\nofficial, granted the title of Grand\nTutor of the court, and his title of\nDuke of Han ranked first among all\ndukes. Weii Wu, a mere commoner without\neven an official title. Dare to treat\nthis duke with such disrespect. This is\na complete provocation against his\nauthority. However, just as a Shan Sean\nwas about to launch another attack, he\nheard Zu Yuan Jang&lt;unk&gt;s voice. It's all\nright. It's our special permission that\nWei Wu doesn't need to kneel and bow\nwhen he sees us. Since Zhu Yuan Jang had\nalready spoken, Lie Shan Chong naturally\ncouldn't say anything more and\nimmediately retreated. At this moment,\nZhu Yuan Jang turned to look at Weii Wu.\nWei Wu, the reason I summoned you here\nis to discuss matters concerning the\nInstitute of the Ming Dynasty. Regarding\nthe location, we have assigned a manner\noutside the city to the Science and\nTechnology Research Institute. But there\nare some issues with personnel. Only you\nunderstand science and the Ministry of\nWorks doesn't know how to select talent.\nSo, let Xiao Jun assist you in selecting\ntalent. Furthermore, Shan Chong and the\ntwo ministers have doubts about the\nscience and technology research\ninstitute. Only you can answer these\nquestions. Upon hearing this, we wu\nunderstood why Zu had summoned him.\nSimply put, it's for the purpose of\npromoting scientific research\ninstitutes. However, it is clear that\nthis matter was questioned and even\nopposed by the ministers. It is likely\nthat it was a group of civil officials\nled by Lee Shan Shan. He was summoned\nhere to demonstrate the effectiveness of\ntechnology and incidentally to slap\nthese ministers in the face with facts.\nAs emperor, Zhu Yuan Jang could\ncertainly act arbitrarily, but this was\nnot the best way to handle the\nsituation. Officials should be allowed\nto express their differing opinions, and\nthey should not be punished for their\nwords. Therefore, Zhu Yuan Jang\nabolished the censor rate in the 13th\nyear of Hung Wu&lt;unk&gt;s reign and\nreestablished the censor rate in the\n15th year. Now that he understood that\nZhu Yuan Jang wanted him to control\nthese ministers, Weii Wu had no reason\nto hesitate. He turned around, met the\ngaze of the three officials opposite him\ncalmly and asked, \"If you three have any\nquestions about the Science and\nTechnology Research Institute, please\nfeel free to ask and I will answer them\none by one.\" Chapter 54. Let's replace\nthe Korean male with a female. They're\npretty much the same anyway. After Wei\nWu finished speaking, Lie Shan Chong\nseemed to have found an opportunity and\nimmediately stood up to question him. In\nthat case, you might as well state first\nwhat the purpose of your so-called\nscientific research, which involves\nspending human and material resources,\nis, whether it is beneficial to the\ncountry and the people, whether it is\nbeneficial to the affairs of the world,\nand what contribution it makes to the\nnation and its people. Good heavens, Lie\nShan Chong really dares to speak his\nmind. He immediately invokes the banner\nof family, country, and the world.\nHowever, these problems were no\nchallenge for Wayi Wu. Then I'll first\nexplain what the Science and Technology\nResearch Institute means by science and\ntechnology and then answer the other\nquestions from the Korean minister.\nAfter saying this, we took a deep breath\nand carefully considered his words\nbefore speaking. So-called technology is\nmerely a byproduct of science. While\nscience itself is the investigation of\nthings, the exploration and\nunderstanding of the universe and all\nthings. Nonsense. Human power is so\ninsignificant, and the might of heaven\nand earth is beyond the comprehension of\nmortals like us. This is utter nonsense.\nBefore Wei Wu could finish speaking, Lie\nShan Chong immediately rebuked him.\nSeeing this, Wei Wu was not in a hurry.\nHe waited until Wei Wu finished speaking\nbefore leisurely replying. I spoke of\nheaven and earth and all things, but the\nDuke of Han only focused on the words\nheaven and earth and pressed on\naggressively without mentioning the word\nall things at all. It seems you don't\ncare at all what I said. You're just\nrefuting for the sake of refuting. Is\nthis all the magnanmity a duke should\nhave? Furthermore, before I could finish\nspeaking, the Duke of Han interrupted\nme. Such rudeness. Have you wasted your\ntime studying the classics? Others might\nbe intimidated by Lee Shan&lt;unk&gt;s power.\nAfter all, he was one of three dukes.\nMoreover, he was the leading figure\namong the civil officials of the Haishi\ngroup. The titles of Grandmaster of the\npalace, pillar of the state, Grand\nTutor, Duke of Han, and other\nhigh-ranking officials of the current\ndynasty are terrifying to even mention.\nHowever, Wayi Wu was not a Ming Dynasty\nperson, and he had no intention of\nbecoming an official, so would he care\nabout these things? Lean Chan's power is\nnone of his business. He doesn't need to\ncare about anything and can just do\nwhatever he wants. As it turned out,\nWayi Wu&lt;unk&gt;s attitude really angered\nLee Shan Chong. Given his status, every\ncivil official in the court would\ncarefully consider his words before\nspeaking to him. Now, however, he is\nbeing humiliated by an unknown junior\nwhose attitude lacks even the most basic\nrespect. But what we wu said was true.\nIt was indeed him who interrupted Weii\nWu. In front of the emperor, he could\nnot use his power to intimidate him. So,\nhe could only suppress his anger and\nglare at Wei Wu. Seeing that he remained\nsilent, Weii Wu continued, \"Science\nconsists of three steps. First,\nexploring all things. Second,\nunderstanding the nature of all things.\nAnd finally, striving to achieve control\nas asked by the Korean government. The\npurpose of spending manpower and\nresources is to complete the first two\nsteps in order to reach the third step.\nTechnology is derived from science and\nrepresents the methods and tools by\nwhich human beings control all things.\nAfter saying this, Wayi Wu stopped and\nlooked at the three of them, waiting for\nthem to speak. In fact, Luchon Chong had\nbeen holding back for a long time, and\nnow he could finally speak. You say you\ncan control everything, right? Then why\ndon't you demonstrate what you control?\nThat way, we can broaden our horizons.\nLie Chong was clearly deliberately\nstirring up trouble here, seizing on a\npoint to embarrass Wu. Chow Chow was\nreferring to the process and the\nachievable result, and he explained that\nit was divided into three steps.\nHowever, Lee Shan Chong completely\nignored the first two steps and let him\ndemonstrate success before even starting\nthe research. This is like asking a\nnursing infant to solve a calculus\nproblem immediately. It's incredibly\ndifficult. Fortunately, we didn't need\nto solve math problems. He only needed\nto demonstrate his results. Luchan Chong\nhad walked right into a trap with this,\nand it was no challenge for Wayu at all.\nWeiiu reached into his robes and pulled\nout a small dark stick. Then looking at\nLishan Chong, he said in a contemptuous\ntone, \"With your intelligence, it's&lt;unk&gt;\ndifficult for me to explain to you, but\nI can let you experience the taste of\nlightning.\" Upon hearing Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s\nwords, not only Lie Shan Shong, but also\nthe other two officials were stunned.\nLightning: This is the greatest power of\nheaven and earth, a power that only\ncelestial beings can wield. But this\narrogant young man in front of me\nactually uttered such outrageous words.\nWhile Isan Chong and the other two were\nsecretly complaining, they didn't see\nthat Ju Yuan Jang&lt;unk&gt;s expression had\nchanged. That kid is so ruthless.\nBringing this out means they're\ndetermined to kill Lie Shan Shan. Others\nmight not know what Wayu had taken, but\nhe knew very well what it was. Last\ntime, Lu was defeated by this thing. I\nthink it was called something like the\nThunder Cudel. Even a seasoned general\nlike Lan Yu, who had fought on the\nbattlefield, couldn't hold on, let alone\nLi Shan Shan, who was over 60 years old.\nTherefore, before Lie Shan Chong could\nspeak, Zhu Yuan Jang preemptively spoke\nup to stop him. Weii Wu, the power of\nhis lightning, is too fierce. Shan Chong\nis too old to try it himself. Just\nkidding. If we Wu really did that to Lie\nShan Chong, he might just die right here\nin the palace. Although Lie Shan Chong\nhas become somewhat arrogant over the\nyears, he is still one of the founding\nfathers of a nation. Moreover, Luchan\nChong is still useful at this stage and\nZu Yuan Jang cannot allow anything\nhappened to him. Wayi Wu actually\nunderstood this. He was just teasing him\non purpose. Therefore, after Zu Yuan\nJang spoke, Wei Wu readily agreed and\nsaid, \"That's right. Let's replace the\nKorean male with a chicken. They're\npretty much the same anyway.\" Upon\nhearing Weii Wu&lt;unk&gt;s words,\nLiechan&lt;unk&gt;s face immediately turned as\nblack as charcoal. The two officials\nstanding nearby understood the ambiguity\nin Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s words and immediately\nlowered their heads. Only Zhu Yuan Jang\nshowed no reaction. Though his\nexpression was somewhat strange,\nhowever, he didn't say much, but simply\nordered the palace servants to find a\nlive chicken. But how could the Shan\nChong swallow this insult? He\nimmediately started to cause trouble for\nWei Woo. Again, let's leave aside the\nfact that the control of lightning has\nnot yet been verified. If you say that\nscience controls all things, then it\nmust also be able to control other\nthings. All things in heaven and earth\nare bathed in sunlight. Since you have\nmade such a bold statement, let the\nsunlight outside shine into this room.\nOr perhaps you could control the wind\nthat is everywhere in the world and let\nit go wherever you wanted to. In ancient\ntimes, there were no electric lights,\nonly candle light, and the people were\nin a palace. Although it is broad\ndaylight, the room is completely dark,\nrelying entirely on the light from the\ncandles. Although it doesn't obstruct\nthe view, it still gives a consistently\ndim feeling. It must be said that Lee\nShon knew how to make things difficult\nfor people. He didn't mention things\nthat could be seen and touched, but\ninstead used intangible things like\nlight and wind to make things difficult\nfor Wei Wu. The two ministers standing\nto the side first glanced at Lee Shan\nChong, then looked at wei Wu and\nsecretly shook their heads. Of all\npeople to offend, he had to offend Lee\nShan Chong, the Duke of Han. This person\nappears kind and gentle on the surface,\nbut is actually jealous and harsh\ntowards others. In official when dealing\nwith this kind of person, it's best to\navoid offending them if possible. In\ntheir view, we should have bowed his\nhead in that situation. A moment of\npatience brings calm, and taking a step\nback opens up a vast expanse where\nnothing will happen. But Chow Chow\ninsisted on confronting him head-on,\nwhich led to his current predicament.\nUnfortunately, whether it was a Shan\nChong or these two ministers, their\nvision and thinking were always limited.\nIf Wayiu knew what they were thinking,\nhe would only give a simple reply. You\nknow nothing about the power of\ntechnology. Chapter 55. What's so\nspecial about moving light into a room?\nHave you ever seen white light appear in\nan empty room? We didn't care what the\ntwo ministers thought. All he wanted to\ndo now was to slap Lee Shan Chong in the\nface. So after Lee Shan Chong finished\nspeaking, he immediately said,\n\"Controlling sunlight is indeed very\ndifficult. Not to mention now, even a\nthousand years from now, it may not be\npossible to do so. Snort. Upon hearing\nWei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s reply, Lie Shan Chong\nsnorted coldly, believing that Weii Wu\nwas beginning to show weakness.\nUnfortunately, Lysan Chong was not\nprepared to let him off so easily. To\nspeak such arrogant words in front of\nhis majesty, and since you cannot even\ndo it, that is treason. Before Lee Shan\nChong could finish speaking, Wayi Wu\ninterrupted him. Duke of Han, what's\nyour hurry? Have I finished speaking? I\nhaven't even finished, and you're\nalready so eager to kick me when I'm\ndown. I only said that controlling\nsunlight is difficult, but I didn't say\nthat your request is difficult. It's\njust about letting sunlight into the\nhouse. Even a child could do this. I\ndon't understand why you would make such\na childish request. It's ridiculous. I\nwas going to suggest something more\ndifficult, like a white light emanating\nfrom an empty room, but tisske, it seems\nI overestimated your ambition. With each\nword we woo spoke, the fierce glint in\nLeon Chong's eyes intensified. However,\nthis time he was not in a hurry and only\nsnorted coldly after Wei Wu finished\nspeaking. A white light emanating from\nan empty room. How arrogant. You should\nfirst make sure sunlight enters the room\nbefore you talk. Upon hearing this, Weii\nWu slowly shook his head, looked at Lie\nShan Chong with the kind of\ncompassionate gaze one would give\nsomeone with intellectual disabilities\nand then looked at Zu Yuan Jang. Your\nmajesty, could you please send a palace?\nMay to lend me a hand. Allow. Then a\npalace maid came over and Wei Wu reached\ninto his robes and took out two\nexquisite makeup mirrors. Upon seeing\nthe two crystal clearar makeup mirrors,\nthe palace maid's eyes widened in\namazement. She had never seen herself so\nclearly before. She could even see the\npores on her face. In fact, not only the\npalace maids, but everyone else in the\nroom was also attracted by the makeup\nmirror. Whether it was Yu Yuan Jang, Lie\nShan Chong, or the two ministers, they\nwere all filled with surprise. We are\ncurrently in the era of bronze mirrors.\nTrue glass mirrors didn't appear until\nthe late Ming dynasty. Therefore, it's\nunderstandable that these people would\nmake a fuss, but Wu wasn't surprised at\nall. Actually, he still has a few of\nthese, but he doesn't need that many in\nthe current situation. This room is just\naround the corner from the outside of\nthe main hall. Two mirrors are enough.\nWe woo handed a makeup mirror to a\npalace maid and then instructed her to\nstand outside the palace with a mirror\nin her hand. After adjusting the angle\nin the sunlight, he stood at the corner\nwith a second makeup mirror in his hand.\nThe next second, sunlight entered the\nroom through the reflection of the\nmirror. Moreover, Wayi Wu deliberately\naimed the refraction point at Leon\nChong, shining the reflected light\ndirectly into his eyes. The blinding\nrefracted light kept flashing, and even\nwith his eyes closed, Lee Shan Chong\ncouldn't get through it. Weii Wu&lt;unk&gt;s\nlight shone brightly on his old eyes.\nwhile we Wu teased him playfully from\nthe side. How is it, Korean prince? This\nhas hit your face. Do you feel the\nwarmth? I already said this request is\nchildish. Even a young child could do\nit. It's not difficult at all. Seeing\nthat he had had enough fun, we wu put\naway the makeup mirror. Then, under the\nreluctant gaze of the palace maids,\nanother makeup mirror was handed to Zhu\nYuan Ja. Your Majesty, this mirror was\noriginally intended for the empress, but\nnow it is offered to your majesty. After\nsaying this, Wayi Wu blinked with one\neye, and Juu Yuan Jang chuckled inwardly\nbefore reaching out to take it. Then\nWayi Wu turned his head again to look at\nLi Shan Chong. At this moment, Lie Shan\nChong&lt;unk&gt;s eyes had recovered, and he\nwas looking at Wei Wu with a gloomy\nexpression. Their eyes met, and Wei Wu\ncould clearly feel the intense killing\nintent in Li Shan Chong&lt;unk&gt;s eyes. He\nsimply didn't care, casually chuckled,\nand continued speaking. Why is the\nKorean prince looking at me like that?\nDid he not get enough of being shot and\nwant to go again? I'm not interested in\nthis kind of low class stuff. How about\nwe play something more upscale? What if\na white light were to emerge from an\nempty room? Lean Shan was unable to\nrefute Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s mockery. The reason\nis simple. His request was for sunlight\nto shine into the room, and Weii Wu did\njust that, and they even shot it back\nand forth in his face several times. Did\nthe ancients not understand that light\nrefracts? Of course not. Wherever there\nis water, it is easy to see the sunlight\nbeing refracted. They just didn't expect\nthat way we would solve the problem so\neasily. They weren't particularly\nsurprised by what they had just\nwitnessed. What's truly amazing are\nthose two makeup mirrors because they're\nso clear. It's like seeing another\nversion of yourself reflected in front\nof you. But now their curiosity is drawn\nto way Woos description of the white\nlight emanating from the empty room.\nThis is a realm that only highly\naccomplished Tauist masters can reach as\ndescribed in Tau scriptures. To have\nwhite light emerge from nothingness.\nWhat a wondrous state that is. Even Lie\nShan Chong, though he didn't say it,\ncouldn't help but be curious about how\nWei Wu had managed to do it. At this\nmoment, Weii Wu spoke again, still\ntargeting Lie Shan Chan. Korean prince,\nwhat's about to happen will open your\neyes, so don't blink. Why did We Woo\ntell his Chong not to blink. Because he\nhad already taken out the powerful\nflashlight while he was speaking. A\nsmall dark stick, which looks very\nsimilar to the stun gun from before.\nIt's just that it's much shorter, about\nthe size of a palm, and doesn't look\nparticularly impressive. Zu Yuan Jang\nunderstood Wei Woo and knew that what he\nbrought out was definitely not simple.\nBut others didn't know. They were just\ncurious about what the connection was\nbetween this small black stick and the\nwhite light emanating from the empty\nroom. Just as everyone was wondering,\nWayi Wu grabbed a powerful flashlight\nand pointed it at Lee Shan Chong's eyes\nagain. But instead of opening it\nimmediately, he turned to look at Zu\nYuan Jang. Your Majesty, may the palace\nservants extinguish the candles? This\nway, we can more directly experience the\nmystery of the sudden appearance of the\nwhite light. Upon hearing Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s\nwords, Zhu Yuan Jang naturally did not\nobject and immediately ordered his men\nto carry them out. Soon, the candles in\nthe room were extinguished and the whole\nroom became pitch black. There was some\nlight at the corner, so we weren't\ncompletely plunged into darkness. Weii\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s lips curled into a wicked smile\nas he turned the intensity of the\nhigh-powered flashlight to maximum and\nswitched it to beam mode. He then aimed\nat Leon Chongs eyes and press the switch\nwith a flick of his finger. Snap! A soft\nsound rang out and then a blinding white\nbeam of light suddenly appeared in the\nroom. Then a gasp suddenly came from\ninside the room. Ah! Everyone looked\ntoward the location of the pillar of\nlight, following the sound, and saw Lee\nShan Chong covering his face and eyes\nwith his arms. In fact, he was not\nharmed at all, and brief exposure to\nlight would not cause damage to his\neyes. It's understandable that his eyes\nwould feel swollen and painful from\nbeing suddenly exposed to strong light,\nespecially since he's over 60 years old.\nSeeingly Shan Chong's disheveled\nappearance, Weii Wu smiled and then\nswitched the mode to aperture mode. In\nan instant, a burst of bright light\nilluminated the room as if it were\ndaytime. Chapter 56. A single clever\ntrick caused China to fall behind for\nmany years. Just as everyone's eyes\nadjusted to the darkness, they were\nsuddenly greeted by a bright light, and\nthey all instinctively squinted.\nHowever, this experience allowed them to\nwitness what it means for a room to emit\nwhite light. As Wayi Wu moved the\npowerful flashlight in his hand, every\npart of the room became clearly visible.\nAfter the palace servants lit the\ncandles again, everyone in the room\nturned their attention to the powerful\nflashlight in Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s hand. No\nmatter how they guessed, they couldn't\nunderstand what this little black stick\nwas. It's only as short as a palm, yet\nit emits a powerful light that\nilluminates the entire room. But Wayi Wu\nwas too lazy to explain to them and\ncasually put away the high-powered\nflashlight. Just then, a palace servant\ncarrying a live chicken came to the\ngate. Before the palace servants could\nspeak, Weii Wu stepped forward and took\nthe hemp rope binding the chicken's\nfeet. Then, we turned to look at Lee\nShan Chong again. The South Korean\npublic is watching closely to see if\nlightning can be scientifically\ncontrolled. As he spoke, Wayi Wu shook\nthe hemp rope and then saw the live\nchicken flap its wings and fright. At\nthis moment, Wayi Wu picked up the stun\ngun, turned off the safety, and pressed\nthe switch. Even though the room is now\nbright, the white light at the tip of\nthe stun gun can still be seen flashing.\nClap clap clap clap. Amid a series of\nrapid explosions, the stun gun was\nshoved into the live chicken. In the\nblink of an eye, the live chicken that\nwas flapping its wings just moments\nbefore stiffened instantly. 2 seconds\nlater, Weii Wu released the rope and the\nlive chicken fell to the ground, but\nremained motionless. Then, we wu held up\nthe stun gun in one hand and looked at\nLeon Shan. So, Lor Hung, you have\nalready shown me your control over light\nand lightning. Am I still spreading\nheresies? Seeing the stun gun waving in\nWei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s hand, Lishan Chan\nsubconsciously took a step back.\nAlthough his momentum had weakened, Leon\nChan&lt;unk&gt;s words remain defiant. It is\nindeed somewhat strange, but it is just\na crooked path and a strange skill. What\nuses it to the country and the people?\nWayi Wu wasn't too angry about Leon\nChongs previous actions. Even if the\nother party is aggressive and has a\ncondescending attitude, it doesn't\nmatter. But now this phrase strange\nskills and ingenious tricks immediately\nignited way woos temper. This quote\ncomes from the book of documents and it\ncriticizes Kingha of Shong for indulging\nin pleasure and using strange and\ningenious tricks to please women. But\nlater it changed its meaning and those\nliterati wanted to highlight the status\nof all other professions are inferior.\nOnly studying is superior. They like to\nuse tricks and ingenuity to attack\nknowledge from other disciplines.\nExploring new things is considered a\nclever trick. The emergence of new\ntechnologies is considered a clever\ntrick. Everything is considered a clever\ntrick. China's technology in all aspects\nfar surpass that of Europe at the same\ntime. And the four great inventions all\noriginated in China. Because of this one\ningenious trick, they were caught up\nwith and even overtaken by others.\nBecause of this one phrase, tricks and\ngimmicks, countless new technologies and\ninnovations have been nipped in the bud.\nThe result was humiliation. Being\nbullied by others with more advanced\ntechnology. Although we woo did not\nexperience a century of humiliation, he\ndid experience the backwardness of that\ntime. Powerful nations leveraging their\ntechnological advantages have stolen\ncountless precious resources. Even so,\nthey continued to suppress and sanction\nChina, restricting its development and\nrise at every level. Now, Lie Shan\nChan's words about strange skills and\ntricks have completely ignited Wei Woos\nanger, and he's become quite blunt in\nhis speech. Strange tricks and ingenious\nskills. Again, strange tricks and\ningenious skills. It is because of\nvermin like you that China has suffered\nso much humiliation. Is technological\nprogress just a clever trick? The curved\nplow, which deeply tills the land and\nincreases grain yield. Isn't that a\nclever trick? Isn't it a kind of\ningenious skill to weave cloth on a loom\nso that you can have clothes to keep\nwarm and cover your body in winter? At\nthis point, Wayiu walked directly to\nLeon Chong, staring at him with a fierce\nglint in his eyes. Lee Shan Chong, you\nson of a You eat food grown with\nstrange and ingenious techniques and\nwear clothes woven with strange and\ningenious techniques. Enjoying the\nconvenience brought by these ingenious\ntricks while cursing as soon as you put\ndown your chopsticks. You're really a\npiece of trash. If you're so capable,\nthen don't touch anything produced by\nstrange and ingenious techniques. Let's\nsee if you, you old dog, can still spew\nfill from your mouth. Didn't you ask\nwhat use these things are to the country\nand its people? Fine, I'll tell you what\nthey're useful for. Lee Shan Chong was a\nman of such status. And when had he ever\nbeen insulted like this before? Now, he\nwas being humiliated like this by Wei\nWu, a peasant from the lowest rungs of\nsociety. How could he possibly tolerate\nit? However, we was not going to give\nhim a chance to speak. A few days ago, I\npresented his majesty with grain seeds,\na type of grain that can yield 25 sh\npermu or even 41 sh perm. This kind of\ngrain can be grown three times a year. I\nask you, is it beneficial to the country\nand the people? Is it related to the\ncountry? Upon hearing we woo&lt;unk&gt;s\nwords, Lee Shan Chong's anger surged and\nhe was also incredibly shocked. Grain\nhas always been a crucial and paramount\nissue in ancient times. In the early\nMing dynasty, the grain yield perm was\nonly two to three sure, which was only\npossible in the Jangdan region, a land\nof fish and rice. In other places, one\nor two stones would be considered quite\ngood. But now, Wayi Wiu can ask for 25\nsure, a unit of dry measure at a time,\nand sometimes even more than 40 sure. To\nthem, neither Li Shan Chong nor the\nother two ministers could believe such a\nthing. Their first reaction was that Wei\nWu was lying. Coming to his senses, Lie\nShan Chan was about to use this\nopportunity to attack Wei Wu when he saw\nWayi Wu turn his head to look at Ju\nYuanh. Your Majesty, have those potatoes\nbeen planted yet? Upon hearing this, Zhu\nYuan Jang immediately spoke? Some of the\nsprouted ones have already been planted\naccording to your method, and many more\nare still undergoing germination. Seeing\nthis, we turned to look at Lie Shan\nChong again. Lie Shan Chong, let me tell\nyou, the earliest yield of this kind of\ngrain was also not much. At most, only\nseven or eight sure perm. It is through\nin-depth research into the so-called\ningenious skills and ingenuity. You\nmentioned that the grain yield has been\nincreased to its current level. You\nthink you're something special just\nbecause you've read a couple of books of\nsages. You're just a pig pretending to\nbe an elephant. Nothing more than a\npiece of trash using the words of sages\nto seek personal gain. After a flurry of\nattacks, Wayi Wu once again spoke about\nthe role of technology. Let me tell you,\nscientific research is enough to change\nthe world. Life is nothing more than the\nfour necessities of food, clothing,\nshelter, and transportation. Clothing,\neven a thin shirt, can protect against\nthe cold. Food can increase grain\nproduction several times or even dozens\nof times. For living, cement can be used\nto build high-rise buildings, and 100\nfamilies can live in a place where 10\nhouseholds live. For transportation, it\ncan carry a 100 people to travel a\nthousand miles in a day. What you call\ningenious skills and tricks can\naccomplish things that you could never\nachieve in your entire life. That is the\npower of science. Ways words left Shan\nChong speechless. He could have caused\ntrouble in this area before\ndemonstrating the power of technology.\nBut Wayi Wu had already demonstrated the\nfacts. And if he continued to make\nthings difficult for Zhu Yuan Jang, it\nwould be disrespectful to him. What Juan\nJang said next proved to be true. Now\nthat you, my dear ministers, have\nwitnessed the wonders of science. Let\nthis matter be settled and no longer be\ndiscussed. The Ministry of Revenue will\nplan out the land and hand it over to\nWei Woo, while the Ministry of Works\nwill select craftsmen to cooperate. This\nmust not be neglected. We woo, please\nstay. My dear ministers, please make\nyour own arrangements. Chapter 57. What\nwill become of Leon Chong? you'll\nprobably just chop them up. Since the\nemperor had already ordered them to\nleave, Lie Shan Chong and his companions\nnaturally dared not linger. After bowing\nrespectfully, he withdrew from the hall\nand left. After they left, Zhu Yuan Jang\nlooked at Wei Wu with amusement. Shiao\nWu, you've really opened our eyes today.\nYou're usually so lazy, but you actually\ngot angry and swore in front of us.\nWhat? We woo sighed deeply before\nexplaining. Uncle Zu, I don't want to\nget angry either. If you knew what\nhappened in the future, you might have\ncursed me even more fiercely. Our land\nof China is full of talented people.\nWhether it is the brilliant culture or\nthe advanced technology, it far\nsurpasses the barbarian countries\noverseas. The four great inventions,\npaper making, the compass cart,\nprinting, and gunpowder, all originated\nhere, laying a solid foundation for\nscience. We should have stood at the\npinnacle, letting the world see clearly\nwho truly deserves to be called the\nuncrowned king of this world. At this\npoint, Wayi Wu took a deep breath to\ncalm himself down before continuing. And\nwhat was the result? Those scholars, in\norder to elevate their own status,\nsuppressed other forms of knowledge\nwithout any explanation. As the ancients\nsaid, the extension of knowledge lies in\nthe investigation of things. Only when\nthings are investigated can knowledge be\nextended. Yet they only preach the words\nof sages that benefit themselves. A\nsingle phrase, tricks and gimmicks, has\nrendered science obsolete, truly harming\nChinese civilization immensely. As he\nspoke, Wayi Wu recalled the numerous\nhumiliating treaties signed by theQing\ndynasty that seeded sovereignty to the\ncountry. During the lateqing dynasty,\n8,000 British and French troops invaded\nTanzhin. And theQing dynasty dispatched\n7,000 cavalry and more than 20,000\ninfantry to fight back. 10,000 dead or\nwounded, yet only five enemy soldiers\nkilled. Such a laughable record has\nnever been seen throughout history. Why\ndoes this happen? Because they have\nsuperior technology and advanced\nweaponry. It's a complete technological\ncrushing victory. So much so that later\nwhen the 8- nation alliance stormed\nBeijing, forcing theQing dynasty to seed\nterritory, pay indemnities, and sign\ncountless humiliating treaties, I at\nthis point, even we woo himself couldn't\ncontinue speaking. There was nothing I\ncould do. It was so incredibly\nembarrassing that the more I talked\nabout it, the angrier I got, and I had\nnowhere to vent my anger. On the other\nhand, Zhu Yuan Jang could fully sense\nweigh Wu&lt;unk&gt;s emotions from his words.\nFrustration, anger, repression, anger at\ntheir inaction, yet powerless to do\nanything and nowhere to vent one's\nanger. But to be honest, even Zu Yuan\nJang himself. After hearing what we Wu\nhad to say, I broke out in a cold sweat.\nThe 8 nation alliance invaded Beijing,\nforcing the city to seed territory, pay\nindemnities, and suffer national\nhumiliation by signing a treaty. He\ndidn't need to experience these things\nfirsthand. He could imagine the\nsituation just by hearing these\ndescriptions. If you apply one or two\nmore words to the Ming dynasty, the urge\nto draw a sword and chop someone up\nimmediately arises. After shaking his\nhead to dispel the images in his mind,\nZhu Yuan Jan looked at Wayi Wu with a\nlook of understanding in his eyes. No\nwonder Lie Shan Chong&lt;unk&gt;s words, which\nwere merely a pretense of saving face,\nmade you so angry. We just randomly used\none or two words from your description\nto describe the Ming dynasty. And we\nwere already so angry that we want to\nchop a few people up with a knife to\nvent our anger. Upon hearing Zhu Yuan\nJang&lt;unk&gt;s words, Weii Wu gave a rice\nsmile, but his eyes were full of\ndetermination. Therefore, science and\ntechnology must develop at all times. We\ncannot afford not to. Mr. Zu, let me\ntell you about a situation for you to\nconsider. You and Emma were sitting in\nthe palace eating hot pot and singing\nsongs when suddenly a group of\nred-haired devils broke down the city\ngates and killed, burned, and looted.\nClang. As soon as we Wu finished\nspeaking, Zhu Yuan Jang stood up on the\nspot and drew a long sword from\nsomewhere. They dare. I can destroy the\ngreat Yuan dynasty, and I can destroy\nthose red-haired devils. It has to be\nsaid that old Zu is indeed formidable.\nWith just that one move of drawing his\nknife, a murderous aura immediately\nfilled the air. Seeing this, we wu\ncontinued speaking. Therefore, only when\nwe are strong enough and our technology\nand weapons are strong enough to\noverwhelm the whole world can we live a\npeaceful and worry-free life. Zhu Yuan\nJang understood that Wayi Wu was\nemphasizing the importance of science.\nAnd in fact, he shared the same\nsentiment. Having witnessed so many\namazing things, the importance of\ntechnology in his mind is beyond doubt.\nAfter sheathing the sword with a\nbackhand motion, Zhu Yuan Jang spoke\ndirectly. Don't worry, the Ming Dynasty\nRoyal Academy of Sciences is bound to be\nestablished, and no one can stop it. We\njust called you here to save ourselves\nsome trouble. Besides, don't you want to\nknow why Le Shan Chong is causing you\ntrouble? When Le Shan Chong was\nmentioned, Wayiu was genuinely curious\nabout this matter. But before he could\neven ask, old Jew spoke up. Because the\nestate that we allocated to the Academy\nof Sciences was originally intended by\nLie Shan Chong to be bought from the\nMinistry of Revenue and given to his\nnephew. That estate is quite large and\nright next to the river, surrounded by\nthousands of acres of fertile land. It's\na very good location, but your Institute\nof Science and Technology snatched it\naway. You better watch out, kid. He's\nnot a magnanimous person. Upon hearing\nZhu Yuan Jang&lt;unk&gt;s words, Wei Wi Wu\nraised his head high, a proud little\nexpression on his face. I'm protected by\nyou. Why would I be afraid of him? If\nnot, I'll go to Annie. Auntie said, no\none can touch me. Upon hearing this, Zhu\nYuan Jang immediately pointed at Wayi Wu\nand laughed and scolded him. You brat.\nWe're enough for you. Don't bother your\naunt. After saying that, Zhu Yuan Jang\nturned to ask about Leon Chong. By the\nway, Shia Wu, we want to know about Lie\nShan Chong&lt;unk&gt;s future fate. Tell us\nabout it. You chopped it down, didn't\nyou? Unlike Zhu Bao and Zu Di Wu did not\nhesitate to consider Lee Shan Chong.\nWithout the slightest hesitation, they\nimmediately served old Zhu a hearty\ndish. To be honest, Lie Shan Chong\ndeserved to be killed. Just look at all\nthe things he did. After the founding of\nthe Ming dynasty, Zhu Yuan Jang showed\nhim the utmost favor, bestowing upon him\na great deal of rewards without\nhesitation. The purpose was simply to\nhope that Lie Shan Shan would be of one\nmind with the emperor and with the Zhu\nfamily. But this guy doesn't know how to\nbe grateful at all. He killed so many\npeople in the Huian case, but didn't\ntouch Lee Shan Chan. He secretly helped\nHui Yong hide evidence of his crimes.\nAnd despite being deeply indebted to the\nemperor, he did not think of repaying\nthe favor and became estranged from the\nemperor. In order to build a house for\nhimself, he secretly borrowed 300\nsoldiers from Tangha. The civil\nofficials in the capital borrowed 300\nsoldiers. Back then, Lie only had 800\nmen at the Schwan Wu gate incident. They\ndare to break such taboos. They've\nbecome so arrogant and spoiled that\nthey've forgotten who they are. If he\ndared to act like this while Zhu Yuan\nJang was still alive, what would happen\nif he were gone? Besides, in his later\nyears, Zhu Yuan Jong was already paving\nthe way for Zhu Yunwin. Moreover, Lie\nShan Chong lived an incredibly long\nlife, still alive at the age of 77. If\nSema hadn't fallen from grace in\nhistory, Lee Shan Chong might have had a\nchance to become a regent. But who could\nhave imagined that Sema E at the age of\n70 would make even the Luo River feel\ntainted by a single oath? Having learned\nfrom the example of the oath at Lu\nShouer and given the prerequisites that\nLee Shon possessed, he was too\nresilient, lacked gratitude, was the\nleader of the Hawaii civil official\ngroup, and concealed who Wei Yong&lt;unk&gt;s\nplot to rebel. All these things\ncombined, let alone Zhu Yuan J&lt;unk&gt;s\npersonality would have resulted in Xiao\nChiao killing him too. Weii Wu just\ndidn't expect that after he revealed Lie\nShan Chong&lt;unk&gt;s fate. Old Ju, however,\nshowed no surprise whatsoever. Instead,\na smile played on his lips. Weii Wu\nunderstood now and couldn't help but\nsigh inwardly. Damn, Zhu Yuan Jang is\nindeed Zhu Yuan Jang. No wonder he could\nbecome emperor with just a bowl at the\nbeginning. I was too naive. Anyone with\na sound mind would understand why Zu\nYuan Jang reacted this way. Lie Shan\nChan was actually already on Zu Yuan\nJangs death list. He's still useful for\nnow, but once he's no longer useful, his\ndeath will come. The reason Zu Yuan Jang\nasked this question was simply because\nhe was curious whether his decision was\ncorrect. Now that we have Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s\nanswer, whether it is correct or not is\nbeyond doubt. Even after Wei Wu\nanswered, he didn't bother to bring it\nup again and change the subject. By the\nway, you went to the palace with Maang\nearly this morning. Why didn't you come\nto our side? Instead, you went to your\nAunt Ma's place first. Chapter 58. I'm a\nhot-blooded young man, and you want me\nto open a brothel? After Zhu Yuan Jang\nfinished speaking, a hint of displeasure\nremained on his face. We specifically\nhad Maang wait outside, thinking he\nmight have made some new discoveries\nabout the smallox case. Hearing Xu Yuan\nJang&lt;unk&gt;s tone, Weii Wiu raised an\neyebrow and chuckled inwardly. However,\nshe didn't show it, but simply went\nalong with what he said. There are\nindeed clues related to the smallox\ncase, but that's not the most important\nthing. We'll talk about it when Maang\ncomes in. As for why we went to my\naunt's place first, it's because her\nsituation is more important than the\nsmallox case. Zhu Xu Yuan Jang hadn't\nnoticed before, but now he suddenly\nrealized that we ws way of addressing\nEmpress Ma had changed. In the past,\npeople would call her Aunt Ma, including\nher surname, but now they call her Aunt\ndirectly, which is more intimate.\nAlthough he didn't know what had\nhappened, this change was something Lao\nZhu was happy to see. However, he is now\nmore curious about what is more\nimportant than the smallox case. Weiwood\ndidn't keep anyone in suspense and\ndirectly explained the specific\nsituation. Uncle Zu, I've been praying\nto the gods and Buddhas at home every\nday for the past few days, hoping that\nGod will send me the medicine. Well, my\nsincerity moved the heavens and I\nactually received the medicine this\nmorning. So, I went to my aunt's place\nfirst. Actually, this drug wasn't drawn\ntoday. It was clearly obtained\nyesterday. He only suppressed the matter\nof donating medicine because Zhu Yuwan\nwas bullied and wanted to avenge his own\npeople first who knew so many things\nwould happen later which is why the\nmedicine is only now being delivered to\nCunning Palace. However, you can't tell\nthe truth about this kind of thing. You\ncan embellish it a little to make it\nseem like you take it very seriously.\nAnyway, apart from him, no one knows\nexactly when the drug was drawn. As it\nturned out, Wayi Wu's approach was\ncorrect. Upon hearing that the medicine\nhad been obtained, even this seasoned\nemperor couldn't help but tear up. Shiao\nWu, the medicine you mentioned, is it is\nit the one that treats smallpox? To be\nhonest, seeing Zhu Yuan Jang like this,\neven Wu couldn't help but feel a little\nmoved. It is said that the imperial\nfamily is the most ruthless. But looking\nat the emperors throughout history, few\nvalued family ties more than Zu Yuan\nJang. Yet this emperor who valued family\nties so much suffered such a desolate\nold age. Twice the elderly outlived\ntheir children and then his beloved wife\nalso passed away. Now that we woo is\nhere, he no longer has to endure that\nsoul shaking pain. Looking at the\ncautious and expectant emperor before\nhim, we wu smiled slightly and nodded,\nsaying, \"That's right, Uncle Zu. It's\nthe medicine for treating smallpox. It's\nalready been given to Andy and given to\nXionging. Moreover, we obtain a\nconsiderable quantity this time. So,\neven if Annie is accidentally infected,\nwe don't need to worry about running out\nof medicine. Bang. As soon as we Wu\nfinished speaking, Zhu Yuan Jang slammed\nhis hand on the table, stood up, and\nburst into laughter. Great. Haha. Great.\nI can finally relax.\nThese past few days, Zu's mood has been\nextremely low. Yet, he still has to\nspare energy to worry about national\naffairs. Now that the weight has been\nlifted from my heart, I can finally\nrelax and laugh heartily. After a long\nwhile, Zhu Yuan Jang stopped laughing\nand turned to look at Wayi Wu. Shia Wu,\nwe don't know what you want. Just tell\nus. As long as you want it, and as long\nas we have it, we'll give it to you. To\nbe honest, Juan Jang&lt;unk&gt;s words really\nstump Woo. He doesn't aspire to be an\nofficial, nor does he need one. and he\nseems to have more money than he can\nspend right now. After thinking for a\nlong time, Wayi Wu finally found\nsomething that interested him. Uncle Zu,\nyou know, I don't want to be an\nofficial, but I will definitely go when\nwe fight the Japanese pirates in the\nfuture. Why don't you just give me a\ntitle? With a title, but no official\nposition, I won't have to get involved\nin official. Of course, if it causes\ndissatisfaction among the civil and\nmilitary officials, you could just give\nme some silver and land. I'm not picky.\nAfter the founding of the Ming dynasty,\nZhu Yuan Jang divided the nobility into\nthree ranks: Duke, Marque, and Earl.\nFurthermore, it was specifically\nstipulated that civil officials could\nnot be granted the titles of Duke or\nMarquee and could only be granted the\ntitle of Earl at most. Weii Wu asked for\na noble title and at the same time\nspecifically requested that he also\nparticipate in the campaign against the\nJapanese pirates. This clearly means\nthey want to bestow a marquee upon him.\nZhu Yuan Jang understood Weii Wu&lt;unk&gt;s\nthoughts in an instant, but had no\nobjections. If it weren't for the fact\nthat granting a title of duke would\ninevitably face opposition from civil\nand military officials, Zhu Yuan Jang\nwould have been able to offer a duke's\nposition. After all, a title is nothing\ncompared to the contributions and\nimportance made by Wei Wu. However, even\nif he were granted a noble title, it\nwouldn't be that simple since Weii Wu\nhad no military achievements. If it were\nafter the attack on the Japanese\npirates, granting him a marquee would be\nno problem, and no one could say\nanything about it. But now, unless one\nhas made extraordinary contributions,\nbeing granted a title of nobility will\ncertainly be obstructed by the\nofficials. After considering the matter\ncarefully, Zhu Yuan Jang came up with an\nidea. How about this? The matter of\ndonating medicine is extremely precious\nto us, but the civil and military\nofficials will not share our feelings.\nTo be granted a title in this way will\nsurely be met with obstruction. In fact,\nthose corrupt sensors might even try to\nmake us bang our heads against the\npillar in front of the palace. We\npropose that you be granted the title of\nEarl for contributing divine food to\nsave the world, and that you be promoted\nto marquee after the potato yield per\nacre is verified. What do you say for\nWei Wu? As long as he could be granted\nthe title of marquee, the timing was not\nthat important. So when Zhu Yuan Jang\nfinished speaking, he immediately nodded\nin agreement. But at this moment, Zhu\nYuan Jang spoke up again. What should\nhave been yours, but had to be delayed,\nwill give you some more money and land\nas compensation. I will give you 5,000\ntales of gold, 30,000 tales of silver,\n60,000 strings of paper money, and 2,000\nacres of fertile land. Oh, by the way,\nwe&lt;unk&gt;ll give you the May Yin building,\nthe one where you showed off your\nprowess last night to use as a shop.\"\nUpon hearing this, Wei Wu sighed\ninwardly. Sure enough, Zhu already knew\nabout this. However, he was not\nsurprised by this. After all, nearly 50\npeople died last night. This is in the\ncapital and they even use crossbows\nwhich are prohibited weapons. If this\nmatter could be kept secret until the\nnext day before Emperor Zu found out,\nthen he would have been an emperor for\nnothing. Wayi Wu never expected that Zhu\nwould make such a decision and give May\nYanlu to him. After a long period of\nblank expression, Wayi Wu finally came\nto his senses and quickly asked\nquestion. Uncle Zu, you want me, a young\nman full of vigor, to open a brothel? I\ncough cough. I'm not that kind of\nperson. However, it wouldn't be\nimpossible to lead the Ming dynasty to\nmake the service industry more\nprofessional and diversified. But I'll\nbe the Duke's man soon. Wouldn't it be a\nlaughing stock if I really went to open\na brothel? No matter what title you were\ngranted in the future, people may not\nsay it to your face. But behind her\nback, they might call you the chicken\nhead marquee. Fortunately, although Zhu\nYuan Jang was a downto-earth emperor, he\nwasn't that unreliable. Besides, it's\nnow basically confirmed that Zhu Yushuan\nwill marry Wei Wu as his principal wife.\nNo emperor would allow his son-in-law to\nrun a brothel. So, after Wayi Wu\nfinished speaking, Zhu Yuan Jang\nimmediately pointed at his nose and\ncursed him. You wish. That's for you to\nuse as a shop. If you dare to open a\nbrothel, believe me, I'll break your\nlegs. Shops. As soon as Yu Yuan Jan\nfinished speaking, Weii Wu&lt;unk&gt;s eyes\nlit up. Chapter 59. and the truth\nrevealed. The crown princess's end.\nMayanlu is such a nice place. Of course,\nthe good place here does not refer to\nits function. Although its function\ncertainly makes it a good place, but the\ngood place that way Wu mentioned refers\nto its location. The most bustling area\nof the Chin Huai River. After all, the\n14th floor of Hua Chan Jang was built by\nold Jew. So, how could the location be\nbad? Many wealthy businessmen would love\nto buy a shop here but never have the\nchance. Those who can afford to spend\nmoney in places like brothel are\ngenerally people with some spare cash.\nAt the same time, those prostitutes also\nbelong to the high income group and her\nspending power is not bad either. At\nthat time, as long as Mayanlu is\nslightly modified, it will be a surefire\nway to make a profit by selling\nanything. However, Chow Chow preferred\nto build a rare treasures pavilion,\nwhich would be dedicated to selling\nhigh-end items that the ancients had\nnever seen before. Imagine the horrified\nlook on the faces of those highranking\nofficials and nobles in the future\nholding a toddler who is learning to\ntalk. Although I'm not sure of money,\nlife is so long, I have to find some\nenjoyment in it. He loved seeing their\nnaivity and lack of worldliness, and\nWayi Wu couldn't help but laugh as he\nthought about it. However, this smile\nhad a hidden meaning. Zhu Yuan Jang, who\nwas standing nearby, became anxious upon\nseeing it. This brat, could he really be\nplanning to open a brothel? No. The\narranged marriage needs to be done as\nsoon as possible. Otherwise, I'll lose\nall face. What are you thinking, kid?\nYou're not really thinking of opening a\nbrothel, are you? No way. We won't allow\nit. Interrupted by Zhu Yuan Jang&lt;unk&gt;s\nsomewhat impatient voice, Wei Wu finally\ncame to his senses. Uncle Zu, I have a\nheart condition. Your sudden outbursts\nmight frighten me and make me sick\nagain. We Wu replied helplessly and then\ncontinued, \"I'm thinking of opening a\nshop in May building to do business. The\nlocation is good and I'm sure I can make\nmoney there.\" Hearing that way, Wu was\ndoing it for money. Zhu Yuan Jang\nbreathed a sigh of relief. However, he\nclearly didn't want to continue this\ntopic, so he changed the subject and\nasked about what happened last night.\nSuch a big thing happened last night and\nthe Imperial guards didn't even come to\nreport to us. Was that your idea? Since\nold Ju brought it up, Wayi Wu simply\nnodded and said, \"Uncle Zu, so many\nthings have happened recently, and you\nhaven't had much rest these past few\ndays, so we didn't let them disturb\nyou.\" After speaking, Wayi Wu paused for\na moment before continuing to ask. Uncle\nZu should know something about what\nhappened last night. Zhu Yuan Jang\nnodded. He not only knew a little about\nit, but he also knew the cause and\nprocess. In particular, she learned that\nthe guards of those brothel had actually\ninjured Zu Yuwan, causing her to fall\ninto a coma. Oldju almost ordered the\nembroidered uniform guard to demolish\nMin tower and arrest and behead everyone\nthere. Regardless, Zhu Yushuan was still\nZu Yu and Jangs daughter, even though he\nhadn't shown her much affection in the\npast. But now Zhu Yuwan is about to be\nbetrothed to Wei Wu, and the two have\ndeveloped a good relationship. If he\nhadn't been somewhat satisfied with Wei\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s methods of revenge later on, he\nwould have had to take matters into his\nown hands. Seeing Zhu Yuan Jang nod,\nWeii Wu continued, \"Let me tell you\nsomething you might not know. Besides\nthose people with crossbows, there was\nalso a man in black last night. This\nperson is very skilled and must be the\nleader. In the blink of an eye, he\nkilled all five Imperial guards who were\nprotecting me. Fortunately, I had some\nmeans of self-defense and managed to\nseverely injure him. Otherwise, what you\nsee today might be my corpse. Zhu Yuan\nJang had witnessed Weii Wu&lt;unk&gt;s\nmethods. And although he was indeed very\ncurious about them, how did We Woo, such\na skilled assassin, managed to defeat\nhim, but he didn't ask. Meanwhile, Weii\nWu spoke again, continuing, \"That person\nwas a bit strange. He was slender and\nhad a somewhat effeminite appearance.\nAnd he also had two very distinct scents\non him. One smells like urine and the\nother smells like spices. I think you\ncan guess what it is without me saying\nit. Even Jeang how could guess the\nmeaning of this clearly pointed\nevidence, let alone Zhu Yuan Jang. It's\neasy to imagine how shrewd Xu Yuan Jang\nwas to have conquered such a vast\nempire. Upon hearing these two pieces of\ninformation, I immediately knew the\nanswer. After dismissing everyone else,\nleaving only him and Wayi Wu in the\nroom, Zhu Yuan Jang finally spoke. Who\nin the palace do you think is related to\nthe Lou family?\nWayi Wu didn't hide anything, nodding\ndirectly to acknowledge it, and then\nsaid, \"Besides her, I can't think of\nanyone else who would see me as a thorn\nin their side. After all, I was the one\nwho noticed the smallox incident.\nSmallox was originally just an accident.\nBut through my intervention, it became\nan inevitable consequence of human\nintervention. After the incident,\nwhoever was most afraid became the one\nwho was most afraid. And most\nimportantly, Maang already has evidence\nto prove that smallpox is inextricably\nlinked to the crown princess. Upon\nhearing Weii Wu&lt;unk&gt;s last words, Zhu\nYuan Jang&lt;unk&gt;s eyes suddenly narrowed.\nEven though he didn't say anything, Wei\nWu could feel the intense killing intent\npermeating the room. After a moment of\nsilence, Zhu Yuan Jang slowly spoke to\nthe front hall. The two then went to the\nfront hall where Zhu Yuan Jang sat on\nthe dragon throne. Everyone leave the\nmain hall. Summon Mao Xiang to the\npalace for an audience. With that, all\nthe palace unics and maids withdrew. And\nthen Maang led Shinl into the main hall.\nMaang, tell me everything you have found\nout. Seeing the cold expression on Zhu\nYu and Jang&lt;unk&gt;s face, Maang\nimmediately guessed what was going on.\nCovered in wounds, Shunlin approached\nthe dragon throne, bowed to Zhu Yuan\nJang, and then spoke. Your Majesty, it\nhas been confirmed that Shu Xi, the\ncrown princess's personal maid, did have\ncontact with the person infected with\nsmallpox. Maang then revealed all the\nclues he had found, and Zhu Yuan\nJang&lt;unk&gt;s expression grew increasingly\ngrim as he listened. Even though he had\nsuspected it beforehand, the facts still\nenraged him. Shunlin, who was also\nkneeling on the ground, was pale and\ntrembling uncontrollably. He knew that\nChuenshi was involved in some serious\nissues, but he never expected it to be\nthis serious. A mere palace maid, yet\nshe's practically caused a huge uproar.\nHe's nothing but an ant. If he gets\ninvolved in something like this, he'll\nprobably die a horrible death. Thinking\nof this, Shinllin couldn't help but look\nat Wayi Wu. He knew very well that only\nWayi Wu could save his life. On the\nother side, we wu also noticed\nShinllin's gaze and understood what he\nwas worried about. However, we would\ndidn't say anything but just smiled\nslightly and gave him a reassuring look\njust as their eyes met. Zhu Yuan Jang\nalso turned his gaze toward Shinl.\nShinlin, let me ask you, is there a\nsingle lie in what you said? This humble\nsubject would never dare to deceive your\nmajesty. This humble subject guarantees\nwith his life that every word is true.\nZhu Yuan Jang nodded slowly. Someone\ntake Shenllin outside the hall and wait\nthere. As soon as he finished speaking,\ntwo unics entered the palace and led\nShun Lin out of the function hall. After\nthe gate closed again, Zhu Yuan Jang\nlooked at Maang and said, \"Take Shinllin\nto the east palace to find a crown\nprince. Tell him everything you have\nfound out and then wait for him there.\nIf the crown prince takes action, you\nshall return and report. If the crown\nprince is soft-hearted, you shall help\nhim and give the Lou family some\ndignity.\" Chapter 60. Emperor's Ma Shiao\nWu, when you eat roast duck, bring some\nChumba liquor with you. Maang had heard\nJu Yuan Jang say, \"Give the Lu family\nsome dignity twice already.\" But he also\nunderstood in his heart that giving Lady\nLu some dignity was also a way of\npreserving the dignity of the royal\nfamily. If word got out that the crown\nprincess had harmed the crown prince,\nthe entire royal family would lose face.\nThey might even be exploited by the\nremnants of the former Yuan dynasty,\ncausing trouble and sewing seeds of\nfuture problems among the people. As Zu\nYuan Jangs trusted adviser, Maang knew\nexactly how to handle this matter. Upon\nreceiving the order, Maoang immediately\nknelt down to accept it and then left\nFunction Hall. Only Wayi Wu and Zhu Yuan\nJang remained in the main hall, but\nneither of them spoke. After a long\nwhile, Zhu Yuan Jang finally let out a\nlong sigh and slowly stepped down from\nthe dragon throne. Just like that night,\nhe sat down on the steps and waved Wu.\nJust as Wei Wu was about to go over, a\nUnix's voice suddenly came from outside\nthe palace gate. Your Majesty, the\nEmpress has ordered a roast duck to be\ndelivered. Hey, our sister is so kind.\nShe knows we get hungry easily. So, she\nhad roast duck prepared in advance. Zhu\nYuan Jang, who was initially in a bad\nmood, immediately felt much better when\nhe heard that Empress Ma had ordered\nroast duck to be sent over. Seeing the\nsmile on Zhu Yu and Jang&lt;unk&gt;s face, we\nwu also smiled. Then I heard him say in\na sly, cheeky tone, \"Uncle Zhu, is it\npossible that my aunt prepared this\nroast duck for me?\" Upon hearing this,\nZhu Yuan Jang actually laughed\narrogantly and with a wave of his hand,\nhe said directly, Absolutely.\nYour aunt knows we like roast duck. She\nmust have prepared it for us. If you\nwant some, we could just share a duck\nleg with you. It's just a roast duck. At\nthis moment, Zhu Yuan Jang acted like a\nchild, speaking with a smug expression.\nWeii Wu stood to the side without saying\na word, only watching him with a smile.\nZhu Yuan Jang waved his hand and ordered\nsomeone to bring in the roast duck. When\nthey saw the glistening, fragrant roast\nduck in the unic's hands. Zhu Yuan Jang\ncouldn't help but blink, his eyes filled\nwith eager anticipation. However, just\nas he was eagerly anticipating it, the\nunic delivered the roast duck to Wei Wu.\nZhu Yuan Jang was displeased, but before\nhe could speak, we wu spoke first. Did\nher majesty the empress ask you to pass\non any message to me? Yes. Her Majesty,\nthe Empress, said to eat it while it's\nhot and also told young Master Wei to\ncarry his majesty on his back so that it\nwon't be taken away. What did her girl\nreally say that? Before Wei Wu could\neven finish speaking, Zhu Yuan Jang\nstood up and glared at the unic. Stared\nat by Zhu Jang&lt;unk&gt;s eyes, the unic\nquickly knelt down, almost crying in\nfear. This servant dares not deceive\nyour majesty. That is indeed what the\nempress said. All right. All right. You\ncan go now. Zhu Yuan Jang certainly\nwouldn't make things difficult for a\nYunic just because of a single sentence.\nHowever, upon learning the truth, he was\nindeed somewhat displeased and dismissed\nthe person with a wave of his hand.\nAfter the unic left the hall, Wayi Wu\nsuddenly tore off a duck leg and said in\na sly tone, \"Uncle Zu, just tell me if\nyou want some. I'll give you a duck leg.\nIt's just a roast duck.\" As he spoke,\nWayi Wu deliberately raised his\neyebrows, making a funny face, seeing\nWayi Wu&lt;unk&gt;s smug expression after\ngetting the benefit. Zhu Yuan Jang was\nquite angry. But then he narrowed his\neyes and stretched out his large hand\nwith lightning speed. You brat, give it\nto me now. Hey, hey, Uncle Zu, you have\nno sportsmanship. Why are you using gun?\nEnough with the nonsense. Let the\ncapable take the place. I'm going to\ntell Auntie. Go ahead. Leave the roast\nduck behind. In the end, Wayi Wu was no\nmatch for Zhu Yuan Jang, and half of his\nrose duck was taken away. After some\nplayful fighting, the two of them sat on\nthe steps like father and son, gnawing\non duck. Meanwhile, at the Eastern\nPalace, Crown Prince Zuao had already\nlistened to Mao Xiang and Shunlin's\nretelling. Unlike Zhu Yuan Jang, Zhuao\nmaintained a completely expressionless\nface throughout the entire process. It\nfelt like this had nothing to do with\nhim. He was just an outsider. Zhuao only\nspoke slowly after Mao Xiang finished\nspeaking. I understand. Go back and\nreport to Father Emperor. After Zhu Bao\nfinished speaking, he prepared to get\nup, but found that Maang was standing\nstill. Is there anything else you need\nto report? No, it's just that his\nmajesty ordered me to stay here and be\nat his highness beck and call. After\nMaang finished speaking, Zhuao\nimmediately understood what he meant and\ncouldn't help but sigh softly. Father,\nyou underestimate your son too much. All\nright, you may stay here for now. You\ncan return and report back after I have\ndealt with this matter. After speaking,\nZuao immediately ordered someone to\nsummon the Crown Princess Lu while he\nhimself sat down at his desk reviewing\nmemorials. For a moment, the Crown\nPrince's study was so quiet you could\nhear a pin drop. About half a cup of tea\nlater, there was a soft knock on the\ndoor. Gain. The door opened and Crowned\nPrincess Lou, dressed in magnificent\nrobes slowly entered the study. Your\nHighness, did you send someone to summon\nme here because of something important?\nWhen she first entered, Madame Lu\nappeared perfectly normal, and there was\nno apparent problem with her expression.\nIt wasn't until she saw Maang and\nShenllin standing beside her that Madame\nLu&lt;unk&gt;s demeanor changed slightly.\nMaang was Yu Yuan Jangs sharpest weapon.\nWherever he appeared, trouble was sure\nto follow. Looking at Maang&lt;unk&gt;s\nexpressionless face. A strong sense of\nunease spread through Lu Shir's heart.\nMaang was in the crown prince's study\nand the crown prince had ordered someone\nto summon him. Could it be that? As Lady\nLu was pondering this, she saw Zhu Bowo\nraise his head and look at her. I\nbelieve I have treated you well. After\nSister Chong passed away, I immediately\nmade you my principal wife and showered\nyou with the utmost favor. Xionging has\ncalled you mother since he was a child.\nHow could you be so cruel as a mother,\nharming your own child with smallpox?\nWhen Zhu Bao spoke, there was no anger\nin his tone. It was as if he were just\nhaving a casual conversation. However,\nLady Lu, as Zhu Bao&lt;unk&gt;s principal\nwife, knew very well that this meant Zhu\nBao had reached his limit of anger.\nspeaking, Lady Lu did not admit it, but\ninstead questioned him with a wronged\nexpression. My lord, we have been\nhusband and wife for many years. Doesn't\nyour highness know what kind of person I\nam? After my sister passed away, I have\nalways loved Xiang Ying as my own child,\nand your highness has seen it all. Even\ntigers don't eat their cubs, so how\ncould I possibly be so cruel to myself\nand my child? And smallpox is a disease\nthat no human can control. As she spoke,\ntears welled up in her eyes and then\nslid down her cheeks. His extremely\nagrieved appearance would easily evoke\nfeelings of pity in others. Even\nShinllin, seeing Lucir's appearance,\nbegan to doubt whether there had been a\nmistake. However, he was just a nobody,\nnot even qualified stand here, let alone\nspeak. Zhu Bao, who is truly qualified,\nsimply looked at Lady Lu calmly without\nthe slightest fluctuation in his eyes.\nAfter Lady Lu finished speaking, Zhu Bao\nfinally spoke. You should be familiar\nwith the name Fuguay. He was the only\nperson in the capital who contracted\nsmallox. Although he is from Hujo, his\nancestral home is Fong Yong. If I\nremember correctly, your ancestral home\nis also Fong Yong. Chapter 61. Leaf Fong\nkills Lady Lu. Old Zu questions his\nhenchmen. Maang was originally just an\nobserver without much of his own\nopinion. However, upon hearing Zhu Bao's\nwords, a look of surprise flashed in his\neyes. It turns out that his highness,\nthe crown prince, did conduct an\ninvestigation, but his investigation\nfocused on a different area than mine. I\ndidn't even know the guy's name was\nFugui. Your highness even found out his\nancestral home. Although Maoang had long\nknown that the crown prince was a very\ncapable heir apparent, he only truly\nunderstood it now. The future emperor\nbefore us is not only capable, but his\nmethods and cunning are no less than\nthose of the current emperor. Just as\nMaang was pondering this, Lady Lu walked\nstraight up to Zuba. She looked directly\nat Juba, her eyes filled with nothing\nbut endless sorrow and grievance,\nshowing no fear whatsoever. Your\nhighness, I do not know a man named\nFuguay, nor have I ever done anything to\nharm Xing. If your highness does not\nbelieve me, then please grant me death.\nZhu Bao, who had been expressionless the\nwhole time, suddenly smiled when he\nheard this. I did not lay a hand on you\nsimply because I have not yet found any\nevidence that Chuhi and Fugui are\nconnected. But that doesn't mean I don't\nsuspect you now that we have witnesses.\nAre you still going to pretend to be\ninnocent in front of me? As he spoke, Zu\nBao reached under the table and took out\na sealed bag which he then tossed at\nLou's feet. Upon seeing the sealed bag,\nMs. Lou's pupils constricted sharply,\nand she realized that the matter was now\nsettled. As for evidence, well, this\nkind of case is bound to be covered up,\nso there's no need for so-called\nwitnesses and physical evidence. Will\nyou do it yourself, or will I help you?\nUpon hearing these utterly heartless\nwords, Lady Lou finally understood one\nthing. The so-called long-term marital\nrelationship was actually just a\nselfdeceptive joke on her part. Zu Bao\nonly ever loved one person. She was just\na pitiful substitute. Seeing that Madame\nLu remained silent. Zhuao also stopped\ntalking to her. Leong, make your move.\nAt his command, Leong immediately\nappeared in the study, appearing out of\nnowhere behind Madame Lu. He transformed\none hand into a claw and rushed towards\nwhere Lu was standing. His tiger's mouth\naimed directly at her throat. Lady Louu\nsuddenly woke up and turned to look at\nLeo behind her. But at that moment,\nLeangs hand was already about to grab\nher throat. In her haste, Lady Louu only\nmanaged to utter one sentence. Leo, how\ndare you? Upon hearing Lou's voice, a\nresolute and ruthless glint flashed in\nLeang's eyes, and his movements\nquickened even further. Lady Lou saw the\nmurderous intent in his eyes, but it was\ntoo late to say anything at that moment.\nClick. A crisp cracking sound echoed in\nthe study, and Madame Louu collapsed\nweakly to the ground. Even as she\nbreathed her last, her eyes remained\nopen, filled with a complex and\nunfathomable expression. The crown\nprincess was enjoying herself at Schwan\nWu Lake today when she accidentally fell\ninto the lake. Her entourage failed to\nsupervise her properly and have all been\nexecuted. After Zhu Bowo finished\nspeaking, Leong immediately nodded, then\ntook out a piece of black cloth and took\nthe Lu family's package away. Seeing\nthis scene, Maoang didn't feel anything.\nHe was already used to the emperor's\nruthlessness. But Shan was genuinely\nterrified. It was clearly only the crown\nprincess who was guilty, but the crown\nprince's casual remark resulted in the\ndeaths of a large number of people. The\npurpose was simply to cover up the true\ncause of the crown princess's death. How\ncoldblooded the Imperial family is. At\nthis moment, Shunlin felt extremely\nfortunate to have been given to Wei Woo\nas a bodyguard. Otherwise, one day they\nmight end up like these people, losing\ntheir lives without even knowing why.\nJust as Shinl&lt;unk&gt;s thoughts were\nchurning, Zhu Bao happened to look at\nhim. Your name is Shinlin, right? Yes,\nyour highness. From now on, follow Wu\nclosely. Protect him. Listen more and do\nmore. Speak less and make fewer\nmistakes. Understand? Yes, your\nhighness. I understand. Upon hearing\nthis, Zhua nodded and then looked at\nMaoang beside him. Maang, you can go\nback and report to your father now. Yes,\nyour majesty. I shall take my leave.\nAfter bowing, Maang immediately led\nShunlin away from the East Palace and\nrushed to the Funian Hall to report\nback. At this moment, Weii Wu and Juu\nYuan Jang were still sitting on the\nsteps eating roast duck and chatting.\nThe half roast duck in their hand was\nbasically just a skeleton. This was not\nthe first time that Weii Wu and Ju Yuan\nJang had done this, and Maang was\nalready used to it. On the contrary,\nShanllin's expression was one of\nastonishment, as if he had seen a ghost.\nAlthough his emotions were like a roller\ncoaster today, going up and down many\ntimes, but seeing this scene still\nshocked him. the emperor, a king among\nmen. Surprisingly, he and Wei Wu sat on\nthe steps eating roast duck, just like\nordinary people in the city. Previously,\nShinllin only knew that the emperor had\nshown great favor to Wayi Wu. But now,\nhe realized just how deep that favor\nwas. Despite his shock, Shinllin dared\nnot be rude. He merely glanced at him\nbefore lowering his head. Upon seeing\nthe two return, Zhu Yuan Jang casually\ntossed the skeleton into a plate and\nasked, \"Ow, your majesty, his highness,\nthe crown prince, did not ask me for\nhelp.\" Zhu Yuan Jang nodded, then\ncontinued to ask. The crown princess has\nmet with misfortune. Yes, today the\ncrown princess was playing at Schwan Wu\nLake when she accidentally fell into the\nlake and died. The palace servants were\nall executed for failing to take proper\ncare of her. Let the crown prince handle\nthis matter. You may leave. After bowing\nagain, Maoang took Shan Lin away from\nthe palace to treat his injuries.\nSpeaking of which, Shunlin was also\nmiserable. He was covered in injuries\nand had to be dragged to the palace to\nbe a witness. Now he is finally free.\nAfter the two left, Zhu Yuan Jang turned\nto look at Wayi Wu. Xiao Wu, there's\nsomething on my mind. I wanted to ask\nyou about it since the night Lu broke\ninto your residence. Weii Wu was used to\nZhu Yuan Jang occasionally asking him\nfor spoilers and he answered quite\nreadily. Yes, Uncle Zu go ahead and ask.\nAs you know, we merged the Ilwan\ndivision and the Gway division to create\nthe Ginui. I want to know what the Ginui\nis like in later generations. Why did Yu\nYuan Jang care about the embroidered\nuniform guard? Because this was a knife\nhe specially crafted the sharpest knife\nin the hands of an emperor. However, if\na knife is not fully under control, it\nmay injure its owner. Just because Zu\nYuan Jang was able to control this\ninstitution does not mean that later\nrulers will have the same level of\ncontrol. In fact, even if Zu Yuan Jang\ndidn't ask wei Wu about the embroidered\nuniform guard, he would find an\nopportunity to bring it up. I guess what\nold master Zu wants to ask is what the\ndrawbacks of the embroidered uniform\nguard are. Seeing Zhu Yuan Jang nod,\nWeii Wu continued, \"First of all, the\nembroidered uniform guard has too much\npower. In order to facilitate their\nactions, his majesty has given them the\nfunctions of investigation, arrest, and\ninterrogation. Although this method is\nindeed very efficient, and in fact it\nis, the name of the embroidered uniform\nguard makes all officials tremble at the\nmere mention of it. This is probably the\nsituation you wanted to see, Uncle Zu.\nHowever, the fear of the officials has\nalso fueled the arrogance of the\nembroidered uniform guard. At this\npoint, Wayi Wu had to bring up Zhu Di\nagain. I mentioned the Yola Emperor to\nyou last time. Ji Gang, the commander of\nthe embroidered uniform guard during the\nYongla era, was extremely powerful. In\nthe fifth year of the Yongla reign,\nEmpress Sue passed away. Emperor Yongla\nissued an edict to select beauties from\nall over the country, and local\ngovernments sent beauties to the capital\nto gather. This G gang was so audacious\nthat before the emperor even selected\nwomen, he would pick out the most\nbeautiful women and keep them at home\nfor his own pleasure. As soon as we Wu\nfinished speaking, Zhu Yuan Jang snorted\ncoldly from the side, deceiving the\nemperor and committing treason deserves\ndeath. Uncle Zu, this is nothing. He's\ndone many more serious things. Chapter\n62. Refusing the arranged marriage.\nWhoever regrets it is a grandson. Tell\nme all the other outrageous things\nyou've done. After Zhu Yuan Jan finished\nspeaking, Wei Wu did not hesitate and\ncontinued. After selecting the beauties,\nJi Gang confiscated the crown and robes\nof the deceased king of Wu and secretly\nkept them in his home, even wearing them\nin private. Even when drinking with\nothers, he would order his men to raise\ntheir glasses in celebration and shout,\n\"Long live the emperor.\" Yet, no one\ndared to denounce him. Not only did the\nfamily privately support a large number\nof outlaws, but they also secretly built\ntunnels and stockpiled tens of thousands\nof weapons such as knives, guns, arrows,\nand armor. It was only then that Zhu\nYuan Jang realized the even greater\nsignificance of Weii Wu's earlier words.\nWearing royal robes and crown in secret,\nordering people to shout, \"Long live the\nemperor,\" secretly building tunnels and\nhoarding tens of thousands of weapons.\nThis is clearly an act of rebellion. Gi\nGang was merely a commander of the\nembroidered uniform guard. Yet he\nmanaged to achieve such a feat. One can\nonly imagine how arrogant the\nembroidered uniform guard would become\nin the future. However, Zhu Yuan Jang\nthought that was the end of it. Little\ndid he know that the most exciting part\nwas yet to come. Weii Wu observed Zhu\nYuan Jang&lt;unk&gt;s expression, confirming\nthat he had finished processing the\ninformation before continuing. What's\nmost outrageous is that Ji Gang even\nimitated Xiao Gao from the preaching\nperiod and played the trick of calling a\ndeer a horse in front of Emperor Yongla.\nIn the 14th year of the Yongla reign,\nthe Yongla Emperor presided over a\nwillow shooting competition. Ji Gang was\nextremely skilled in archery and\nhorsemanship, but he deliberately shot\nthe arrow off course. He then ordered\nhis subordinates to break off willow\nbranches and shout that they had hit the\ntarget just to see if anyone would step\nforward to correct him. As you can\nprobably guess, everyone present was\nintimidated by Gi Gang's power and not a\nsingle person dared to step forward and\nexpose him. Bang. After listening to Wei\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s account, Zhu Yuan Jang slapped\nthe dragon pillar next to him. The story\nof calling a deer a horse is wellknown.\nIt's a phrase that can also be seen as a\ntactic. This tactic could be used by the\nemperor to test the loyalty of his\nministers or to consolidate his own\npower. However, if it were used by\nsubject, it would be an extremely\nhumiliating thing for any emperor. This\nis something that absolutely cannot be\nallowed to happen. Based on wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s\nprevious description of Juudi, it can be\nconfirmed that Zhu was absolutely\nqualified as an emperor. Based on this,\nZhu Yuan Jang guessed that Ji Gangs\npower was deliberately allowed to grow\nby Zui because he himself was prepared\nto do the same, allowing Mao Xang to be\nhated, feared, and dreaded by the\nofficials. If the opportunity arises in\nthe future, just push them out to take\nthe blame and kill them as well. What\nangered Ju Yuan Jang was that Ju D let\nthings run wild without knowing how to\nmaintain a proper balance. They actually\nlet Ji Gang get away with this to such\nan extent that he even went so far as to\ncall a deer a horse. Excessive\nindulgence would damage the emperor's\nauthority. Perhaps Zhu Di had the\nability to solve it. But what about the\nemperors after him? While feeling\nindignant, Zhu Yuan Jang asked again.\nWhat was the result? Xi Gang was\nexecuted by slow slicing and his whole\nfamily was exiled to the border. Upon\nhearing this, Zhu Yuan Jang became even\nmore certain that Zhu D had done it on\npurpose. Otherwise, it would have been a\ncase of not guarding the border, but\nrather implicating the entire family.\nFortunately, this hasn't happened yet,\nand we can still find ways to avoid it.\nShia Wu, you said that excessive power\nis the first drawback, but is there a\nsecond one? have. We nodded and then\nsaid, \"Your majesty, the system you\nestablish for the embroidered uniform\nguard is the same as that of other guard\nposts. It is a military officer system\nand the position can be inherited.\"\nMilitary officers were promoted for\ntheir merits and their descendants could\ninherit the positions so that there were\nalways cases of meritorious service\nleading to promotions in every\ngeneration. As time goes by, the number\nof military officers increases and the\nnumber of officers does not match the\nnumber of vacancies, which leads to the\nphenomenon of redundant officials. What\nWay pointed out were all very critical\nissues that needed to be addressed. Zhu\nYuan Jang was very clear about this. So,\nafter a brief thought, he came up with\nan idea. If the powers of the\nembroidered uniform guard were split up,\nleaving only one or two, an\ninterrogation were conducted by a\nseparate department, would that be\nfeasible? Wayi Wu gave a rise smile,\nthen shook his head and said, \"Uncle Zu,\nyou think too highly of me. All I can do\nis tell you about the drawbacks that\nhave been exposed. Whether the specific\nsystem should be changed and how it\nshould be changed is not something that\nsomeone like me who has never been an\nofficial can solve. Moreover, the\nembroidered uniform guard is the\nemperor's personal army, so this matter\ncan probably only be decided by you\npersonally. Did Chow Chow really not\nknow? Of course not. Later generations\nhad similar ideas to Zhu Yuan Jang,\nwhich gained widespread acceptance. The\nproblem is that ideas are just ideas.\nWhether they are truly effective can\nonly be answered after implementation.\nIt's fine for Zu Yuan Jang to make his\nown decisions. Even if he's wrong, it's\nthe emperor's own problem. But for Wei\nWoo, getting involved would bring him no\nbenefit since there is no perfect system\nin this world. Zu Yuan Jang knew\nperfectly well that Wayi Wu Chow Chow\nmust know some of the methods for\nreform. Since Weii Wu didn't want to\ntalk about it, he wouldn't ask any\nfurther questions. Of course, Wayi Wu\nwould not be blamed for this. Just as\nWei Wu said, the embroidered uniform\nguard is the emperor's personal army.\nWhile future generations will surely\nfind a solution, Zhu Yuan Jean believed\nhe was no less capable than anyone else.\nNow that he understands the drawbacks of\nthe embroidered uniform guard, he can\nnaturally come up with a better\nimplementation plan. Having figured out\nwhat he wanted to know, Zhu Yuan Jang\nprepared to send Wei Wu back. But as the\nwords were about to come out, he\nsuddenly remembered the expression on\nWei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s face when he mentioned\nopening a brothel. He originally planned\nto discuss it with Empress Ma first, but\nnow he has decided to test the waters\nhimself first. Well, Shia Wu, you came\nto live in the Ming Dynasty all alone\nwith no one to accompany you. Your aunt\nand I are your elders and we're planning\nto arrange a marriage for you so that\nyou'll have someone who cares for you in\nthe future. When we Wu suddenly heard\nZhu Yuan Jang mention bestowing a\nmarriage, he was completely stunned.\nWhat the heck? I've traveled to ancient\ntimes and now I'm forced into an\narranged marriage by my aunt and uncle.\nHow can we, the beasts of modern\nsociety, accept this barbaric custom of\narranged marriages and silent betroal?\nFree love is the only way. Okay. He\nwants to choose the person he likes like\nhis sweet little girl at home. So after\nZu Yuan Jang finished speaking, he\nrefused without hesitation. Uncle Zu, I\nalready have someone I love, someone I'm\nfond of. Why don't you withdraw this\narranged marriage? Upon hearing Wei\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s reply, Zhu Yuan Jang showed no\nemotion. Instead, the corners of his\nmouth curve slightly upward. The girl\nthis kid is talking about must be Yuan.\nLet's test you out first. Withdrawing it\nisn't impossible, but you have to tell\nme first who your sweetheart is. Then\nI'll tell you, you can't interfere. Zu\nYuan Jang waved his hand and said, \"All\nright.\" Despite receiving Zhu Yu and\nJan&lt;unk&gt;s promise. Weii Wu was still\nsomewhat uneasy. You are the emperor.\nYour word is law. You cannot go back on\nyour word. Zhu Yuan Jang grew impatient\nand glared at him, saying, \"You brat.\nAre you going to tell me or not?\" Seeing\nthis, we wu chuckled and said, \"To be\nhonest, I was even planning to ask my\naunt to marry the maid that my aunt gave\nme.\" Upon hearing that it was Zhu Yuwan,\nZhu Yuan Jang smiled. That's true. We\ncan't force someone to do something they\ndon't want to do, but we are planning to\nmarry our princess to you. Since you're\nunwilling, don't you dare regret it\nlater. Anyone who begs us to arrange a\nmarriage for them in the future will be\na coward. Zu Yuan Jang&lt;unk&gt;s meaningful\nlaughter made Weii Wu somewhat\nsuspicious. But can he back down now?\nObviously not. Uncle Zu, I'm telling you\nthis now. If I go back on my word, I'll\nbe a coward. Chapter 63. What title\nwould be best for this noble title?\nHaha. All right, let's see just how\ntough you really are. Zhu Yuan Jang\nlaughed heartily, having already\nunderstood Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s intentions and\ndid not mention the matter of bestowing\na marriage upon him again. After all,\nWei Wu refused even the emperor's\nbestowed marriage, so he had nothing to\nsay about Yusen. As for Wei Wu, to be\nhonest, he was genuinely bewildered by\nZhu Yuan Jang. Although he knew that Zhu\nYuan Jang wouldn't get angry with him\nover something like this. But since it\nwas a refusal to be granted a marriage,\nshouldn't there be some resentment? But\nthe truth is, old Ju was laughing as\nhappily as a pretty widow meeting a\nleerous wolf. Then again, shouldn't I be\nthe one who's happy about not being\nforced in a marriage? Weii Wu thought to\nhimself silently, but his words remained\nquite defiant. Uncle Zhu, just you wait\nand see. I, we woo am the second\ntoughest man in our great Ming dynasty.\nIt wasn't that way Wu didn't want to\nmake bold statements. It was simply that\nhe was self-aware. If we're talking\nabout toughness in the Ming dynasty, who\ncould be tougher than Fong Xiau, who had\nhis neck coated with magic oil? He was a\nremarkable man who in front of the Yonga\nEmperor shouted, \"What harm is there in\nexterminating my 10 clans?\" Weiiw knew\nhe didn't have the guts to utter such\nwords. When Zu Yuan Jang heard Wayi Wu\nclaim to be the second toughest man, he\ndidn't think much of it. He only\nconsidered the emperor to be the most\nsteadfast man in the Ming dynasty in Wei\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s heart. All right, we won't stop\nyou from going home to be with your\nlittle maid. Remember, you must remain\nchased before marriage and not mess\naround. It's that line again. Why does\nthis old man always bring it up with me?\nI really did that. Can you stop me now?\nDespite his inner thoughts, Wayi Wu\nstill gave a normal reply. Okay. After\nsaying this, Wayi Wu prepared to leave\nthe palace to go back and rest and have\nsome good food. However, just as he was\nabout to step out of the palace gate, he\nheard Old Jews voice again behind him.\nBy the way, get a good rest tonight.\nHave the maid prepare your clothes.\nTomorrow, you will attend a morning\ncourt session at Function Hall. Huh?\nUpon hearing Zhu Yuan Jan&lt;unk&gt;s words,\nWayi Wu immediately turned around and\nlooked at him with a puzzled expression.\nAfter a long silence, he finally asked,\n\"Uncle Zu, I am neither an official nor\na nobleman, so why would I attend the\nmorning court? Besides, you have\npromised not to let me get involved in\nofficial.\" Zhu Yuan Jang had long known\nof Weii Wu&lt;unk&gt;s lazy nature, so he\nwasn't angry when he heard what we wu\nsaid. He just looked at Wayi Woo and\nchuckled and cursed. \"You brat, who said\nyou have to attend the morning court\nsession? We said you have to participate\nin the morning court session and you\ncan't refuse.\" Before Wei Wu could\nspeak, Zhu Yuan Jang preemptively said,\n\"You little brat, you want a title,\ndon't you? If the emperor bestows a\ntitle upon you and you dare not come to\nthe Funian Hall to express your\ngratitude, believe me, those civil\nofficials will curse you to death.\" Upon\nhearing this, Wayi Wu finally understood\nthat it was because of the matter of\nbestowing titles. If that's the case,\nthen we really have no choice but to\ncome. Unless there are special\ncircumstances, when the emperor bestows\na title, the person concerned must\npersonally express his gratitude to the\nemperor. Not bad. Not bad. From now on,\nwe're nobles, too. But what title would\nbe best for us? After pondering for a\nwhile, Wei Wu couldn't help but ask\ndirectly. Uncle Zu, what title do you\nthink would be most suitable for me\ngiven this noble rank? We'll handle the\naccount ban issue ourselves. Don't\nworry, will we possibly cheat you? After\nsaying that, Zhu Yuan Jong waved his\nhand directly at Wayi Wu. All right, I\njust wanted to let you know the title,\ngold, silver, and land will be given to\nyou tomorrow. Go back now. Seeing that\nZhu Yuan Jang had waved him away, Wei Wu\ndidn't linger and left Funian Hall,\nheading toward the palace gates. Just as\nWei Wu was rushing home, Leong also\narrived at the shore of Schwan Wu Lake\nwith the body of Crown Princess Lu.\nSchwan Wu Lake is a royal forbidden area\nand ordinary people are absolutely not\nallowed to approach it because it served\nnot only as a royal garden and lake for\nviewing, but also as a warehouse for\nstoring imperial edicts. The yellow\nregister was organized by household and\ncontained detailed information such as\nhometown, name, age, number of people,\nland and houses, household registration,\nand assets. The Yellow Register Library\nwas built on a small island in the\nmiddle of Schwan Wu Lake to prevent\nfires and theft. Therefore, even if Leo\nbrought Lucer's body here, no one else\nwould see it. looking at the calm lake\nsurface with only faint ripples. Lee\nFong did not hesitate and threw the body\ninto the lake. Your majesty, please\ndon't blame me for being ruthless. In\nthat situation, if you didn't die, I\nwould have been torn to pieces. It's\nbetter for you to die than for me to\ndie. Besides, over the years you've been\nholding on to my past, you forced me to\ndo a lot of things for you. At this\npoint, a sudden surge of anger rose in\nLee Fang's eyes as if filled with\nendless resentment. In order to protect\nmyself, I have lived on thin ice in the\nEastern Palace all these years, and I've\ntried my best to find a sliver of hope\nin the cracks. If I make one wrong step,\nI will be doomed. You manipulate me like\na puppet. But did you ever think that\nyou would end up like this yourself? Now\nthat you are finally dead, I can finally\nbe free. Your death was not unjust. Not\nat all. You deserved it. After all, if\nwe're talking about committing evil,\nyou're the mastermind. Standing by the\nlake, Leong stared intently at Crown\nPrincess Lou, watching her slowly sink\ninto the lake. He murmured to himself\nwith a smile on his lips. You could\nclearly tell from his tone that he was\nvery happy and extremely relaxed. Only\nafter the crown princess's body had\ncompletely sunk to the bottom of the\nlake did Leaf Fong turn around and\nprepare to leave. However, at that\nmoment, Lee Fangs body suddenly\ntrembled. He clutched his lower abdomen\nwith one hand, his face turning deathly\npale, and you can see a trickle of red\nblood seeping through the fabric where\nhe was covering his hand. What kind of\nweapon did young Master Way use? It's\nnot like a firearm at all, yet its power\nis so immense. That's right. Leong was\nthe man in black who assassinated Wei\nWoo that night. He was shot twice, one\nin the abdomen, but it was blocked by a\ntoken at his waist. Unfortunately, the\ntoken was made of wood, which offset\nsome of the kinetic energy, but the\nbullet still managed to penetrate his\nbody. However, it was precisely because\nof this token that the bullet did not\ndamage the internal organs, but only\nmade a hole in the body. Weii Wu's\nsecond shot missed, grazing Lee Fang's\narm. Although he was left with a\nlaceration, it wasn't particularly\nserious for Leo and he was able to\nhandle it himself. Neither bullet caused\na fatal wound, which is why he's still\nalive. Fortunately, I won't fight him\nagain, otherwise I might not be so lucky\nnext time. Touching the sticky blood\nstains on his hands, Leong thought to\nhimself. After completing the tasks\nassigned by Zhuao, Leong turned and\nheaded towards the East Palace,\npreparing to return and report back.\nMeanwhile, Weii Wu, who had already\nreturned home, was preparing to visit\nChing Shia. However, halfway there, I\nsuddenly remembered something. I've been\nso busy since last night that I almost\nforgot about today's lucky draw. The\nscene shifts, and Wayi Woo silently\nprays as he looks at the three packages\nin midair in the system warehouse.\nSystem, I'll set a few keywords. You\ndecide. I want it to be alluring in\nappearance. Soft in body, snow white or\npink, elegant and noble with a faint\nfragrance, pleasing and unforgettable.\nChapter 64. The system understands\nkeywords. Nothing tastes better than\ndumplings. After giving the system a\nhint in his mind, Wayi Wu opened one of\nthe packages with great anticipation.\nThe warehouse screen flashed and today's\ngrand prize draw appeared before my\neyes. Looking at the package delivered\nby the system, Wayi Woo was deeply moved\nand couldn't calm down for a long time.\nSystem, you're amazing. I am\nimpressed. You got the keywords down\nperfectly. Awesome. Weey wouldn't even\nneed to open the large square box. You\ncan see what's inside through that\ntransparent plastic film. He shook his\nhead, no longer paying attention to the\nwarehouse, and strode over to Chinga. As\nthe saying goes, it takes a 100 days to\nrecover from a broken bone. Bridget Lynn\nhad several bones broken and she\ndefinitely won't be able to get out of\nbed for a while. However, the household\nchores do not require maids and there\nare four made around. Bridget Lynn\ndoesn't need to worry about anything.\nShe can rest and recover in peace. When\nWayi Wu arrived at the courtyard where\nChing Shia was recuperating, Naza was\nsitting by the bed talking to her as he\nentered the room. Sister Ching Shia, do\nyou think the young master dots on\nSister Yusuan so much? Will he bring out\nmore delicious food tomorrow? Like at\nthis point, Naza tilted her head and\nthought for a moment, her soft round\nface looking extremely cute. Then, in\nthe next second, those clear eyes\nsuddenly lit up, just like the crayfish\nfrom the other day. It was so delicious.\nI've never eaten anything so good in my\nlife. If there's something delicious to\neat tomorrow, I wonder if the young\nmaster would be willing to give us a\nlittle bit. Just a tiny bit would be\nfine. Well, so they're already eyeing my\ninventory. Unfortunately, I don't even\nhave one of these myself. If I want to\neat it, I'll have to pray to the gods\nand Buddhas to make the system take care\nof me. Wayu shook his head and chuckled\nto himself, but he was rather curious\nabout what day would be tomorrow. Just\nthen, Ching Shia, who was lying on the\nbed, also spoke. Naza, being able to\nserve someone as good as the young\nmaster is already the greatest blessing\nof our lives. You know, after being\ngiven a hint by Bridget Lynn, Golzer\nblinked and nodded, saying, \"Yes, I know\nYoung Master is the best.\" Seeing this,\nBridget Lynn also laughed. Young Master\nis kind-hearted and is willing to reward\nus with some precious things. But if\nyoung master doesn't reward us, we can't\nexpect it. We are different from Sister\nYusuan. She is beautiful, gentle, and\nkind-hearted. It is only right that she\nis favored by the young master. As soon\nas Bridget Lynn finished speaking, Goler\nimmediately brought the topic back to\nits original point. Then tomorrow is\nsister Yusuan's birthday, young master\nwill definitely bring out some really\ndelicious things, right? You seeing that\nthe little girl was only thinking about\nfood, Ching Xiao was a loss for what to\ndo. Just then, Wayi Wu suddenly walked\ninto the room. You just said that\ntomorrow is Yusuan&lt;unk&gt;s birthday. Uh,\nyoung master, when did you arrive? Upon\nhearing Weii Wu&lt;unk&gt;s voice, Naza was\nimmediately startled. You were hitting\nmy food right now. Ching Xiao, lie down.\nWho told you to get up? Weii Wu te X\nShia Naza for a moment, then stopped\nChing Xiao from getting up for the first\ntime. Then he continued to ask the\nquestion he had just asked. Naza, you\nstill haven't answered me. Is\nYushuan&lt;unk&gt;s birthday tomorrow? Why\ndidn't she tell me? Sister Yushuan said\nthat the young master is very busy and\nshouldn't be disturbed, but I was\nthinking of secretly telling him. Naza's\nvoice trailed off as she spoke. But Wayi\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s attention was no longer on her.\nIf tomorrow is Yuan's birthday, then the\nthings we just opened in the package\nwill come in handy. It has an alluring\nappearance, a soft texture, and is\neither snow white or pinkish in color.\nIt is elegant and noble with a faint\nfragrance that is pleasant and leaves a\nlasting impression. What else could\nthese keywords combined mean but a\nswan-shaped birthday cake? and it was a\nsuper sized swan-shaped cream cake\nmeasuring 16 in. At that moment, Wayi Wu\ninwardly praised the system for being\nsensible and capable. It just so happens\nthat he doesn't like cake, mainly\nbecause it's too sweet. Not many people\nin later generations like to eat this\nstuff. It was mostly symbolic, though\npeople play with it more often. And it's\nso big we can't finish it all. It's just\nthe right size for Yuan's birthday.\nAfter all, you should cherish your own\nwoman. But how can we make this birthday\neven more memorable? As wayu was\nthinking, he suddenly saw Naza standing\nto the side. The girl looked up with a\nround chubby face and two big pitiful\neyes. Seeing this, we wu asked a\nquestion with some doubt. Naza, what's\nwrong? Young master, will there be\nsomething delicious to eat tomorrow?\nSeeing her like this, we wu suppressed a\nlaugh and continued to ask. Then tell\nthe young master what your favorite food\nis and what your least favorite food is.\nI love crayfish the most, she said, then\nwrinkled her nose. I hate coriander the\nmost. Okay. Wayu nodded. All right, I'll\ngive you coriander tomorrow. Before Naza\ncould react, Wu turned and left the\nroom. At this moment, Naza realized what\nwas happening and immediately pouted,\nsaying, \"Uh, no, young master. Coriander\nsmells awful and tastes terrible.\"\nUnfortunately, Weii Wu had already left,\nso she could only turn a look at Ching\nXia. Sister Bridget Lynn. All right,\nyoung master was just teasing you. Ching\nXia explained with a helpless expression\nwhile we Wu had already returned to his\ncourtyard. As soon as I entered, I saw\nLeah holding a broom, cleaning the yard.\nInside the room, Daba was also holding a\nrag and carefully wiping the PS5. These\nrough jobs were originally meant for\nmaids, but the four young maids took\nthem over. In their words, \"These are\nthe young master's treasures, and they\ndon't trust them to be handed over to\nothers.\" \"La, you're injured, so just\nrest. Leave these things to Naza. That\nlittle girl's got nothing to do.\" Upon\nhearing Wu&lt;unk&gt;s voice, Leah quickly\nturned around. \"Young master, it's just\na minor injury. Nothing serious. Naza\nhasn't been idle either. We've arranged\nfor her to take turns looking after\nBridget Lynn today. As soon as Leah\nfinished speaking, Dabba came out\ncarrying a rag and walked straight to\nWei Wu. Young master, you're back. Yes.\nDabba was very well behaved today, too.\nWeii Wu casually offered a compliment\nand patted Reeba's head. I don't know\nwhat's wrong with this little girl. She\nalways likes to seek his praise. After\ndealing with Doraba, we wu then turned\nto Leah and asked, \"Why do I only see a\nfew of you? Where's Yusian? Sister\nYusuan is in the kitchen. The kitchen?\nWhat is Yusian doing in the kitchen? We\nwill look puzzled. Wouldn't it be easier\nto have a cook? Fortunately, Leia gave\nthe answer shortly afterward. Young\nmaster wanted to eat wild vegetable\ndumplings yesterday, but those things\nhappened afterward, so you didn't get to\neat them. Sister Yusuan learned how to\nmake dumplings from the cook early this\nmorning, saying she would make them for\nyou, young master. When Leah said these\nthings, she did it as if it were the\nmost natural thing in the world. After\nall, in ancient times, washing clothes\nand cooking were women's duties. Not to\nmention that they were maids. However,\nfor Wei Woo, who had never been in a\nrelationship, it was quite a surprise to\nhave a girl cook for him. Don't say it\nwas him. Many people in later\ngenerations who dated for several years\nnever actually ate a meal cooked by\ntheir girlfriend. Does it matter if it\ntastes good? No. What matters is the\nattitude. Chapter 65. Dumplings who feel\ndespair about life. As Wayi Wu was\npondering this, Leah suddenly spoke up.\nYoung master, should I go to the kitchen\nand call Sister Yushwan back? Upon\nhearing this, Wayi Wu immediately shook\nhis head. No need. I'd also love to try\nYuan's cooking. Just kidding. If you\ncall Yusin back, how am I supposed to\neat dumplings today? After saying that,\nWayi Wu didn't linger and quickly went\nback into the house. Meanwhile, in the\nkitchen, Zhu Yushuan had just finished\nmaking her first dumplings. Actually,\nZhu Yushuan didn't need to do these\nthings at all. No matter what, she was\nstill a princess, and even if she wasn't\nthe most favored, she still held a noble\nstatus. I've never even seen these lowly\npeople do things, let alone done them\nherself. However, she herself didn't\nknow why. But when she heard that Wayi\nWu wanted to eat dumplings, she\nremembered it. Looking at the dumplings\nshe had made herself, Zhu Yusuan was\nfilled with a sense of accomplishment.\nThen came the second, the third, and so\non. As their skills improved, they\nproduced more and more finished\nproducts. Finally, more than 30\ndumplings that looked nice and were all\nthe same size were wrapped. At that\nmoment, a maid servant from the\nhousehold, suddenly appeared outside the\nkitchen door. Sister Yusuan, the young\nmaster, is back and has already gone\nback to the main house. Upon hearing the\nmaid's words, Zhu Yusuan immediately\nbecame flustered. 10 minutes later,\nZhuan looked at the more than 30 white\nand tender dumplings in front of her.\nSatisfied, I carried the plate and left\nthe kitchen. After Zu Yusuan left, two\nplastic bags that seemed out of place\nfrom this era fell to the ground where\nshe had been sitting. One of the black\nbags had a line of Indian words printed\non it, which meant death, devil, and\nextreme spiciness. The other red bag was\nlabeled hot pot base. Upon entering the\nhouse, Zhu Yushwan carrying a plate\nimmediately saw Wei Wu. Young master,\nplease try these dumplings. I made them\nmyself. Upon hearing Zhu Yuwanu&lt;unk&gt;s\nvoice, Wayi Wu looked up and gazed\nhappily at the plate in her hand. In\nfact, Wayi Wu had already mentally\nprepared himself for what might be a pot\nof wild vegetable noodle soup. However,\nseeing the actual product still\nsurprised him somewhat. Zhu Yushwan's\ndumplings were surprisingly exquisite,\nand not a single one of them broke\nduring cooking. Each one is exquisitely\nshaped with rounded lines, and you can\neven see some curled edges. Wayi Wu\ncouldn't help but ask a question. Yuwan,\ndid you wrap all of these yourself? Yes,\nyoung master. Is it not wrapped up well?\nYou wrapped it so well. I didn't know\nyou had such skillful hands. Come eat\nwith the young master. After saying\nthat, Wayi Wu pulled Juyusan to sit down\ntogether, then picked up his chopsticks\nand took out a dumpling. Just as he was\nabout to put it in his mouth, he saw\nthat Juyusan hadn't touched her\nchopsticks, so he handed it to her.\nHere, Yushuan. You've worked hard. Let\nthe worker have a bite first. Zu Yuswan\nsmiled shyly, but still opened her mouth\nand took a small bite. It has to be said\nthat all natural wild vegetables are so\nfragrant. You can smell their aroma as\nsoon as you break open a dumpling\nwrapper. Worried that Zu Yuan would be\nshy, Wu didn't eat the half dumpling and\nput on her plate instead. He then\neagerly picked one up and popped it into\nhis mouth, but the smile on his face\nfroze instantly. He glared at the\nhalfeaten piece that Ju Yu Schwan had\nleft. And since it was fine, he then\ntasted the one in his own mouth. Is this\nsome kind of wild vegetable? This tastes\nwrong. It tastes like that bag of super\nspicy strips that I dare not eat. Just\nas I was thinking about it, an\nunbearable burning sensation suddenly\nexploded from my taste buds. With a\nclatter, Wayi Woos chopsticks fell onto\nthe table. Then I saw him cup his head\nwith his hands in a claw-like shape. his\nfingertips slowly sliding down his face.\nThe explosive sensation in his mouth,\nreaching straight to his soul, made his\neyes roll back. At that moment, Wayi Wu\nhad a delusion that life itself was\nhopeless. But Zu Yuwan was standing to\nthe side, cupping her cheeks, and\nlooking at him with expectant eyes.\nYoung master, aren't the dumplings I\nmade delicious? This is so delicious.\nWei Wu had barely recovered when he\nheard Zhu Yusuan's words. What could he\nsay? He couldn't say anything. He could\nonly bite the bullet and answer. Then,\nin a horse voice, he continued to ask,\n\"Yusan, what kind of filling did you put\nin these dumplings?\" \"Wild vegetables? I\nwent out to buy them with the cook\ntoday. They're so fresh.\" \"Wild\nvegetables?\" Upon hearing this word,\nWayi Wu immediately looked at the half\ndumpling in Zhuwan's hand. \"No problem.\nIt really is wild vegetable. Am I\nhallucinating? Just then, Zuyushuan\npicked up the half dumpling and put it\nin her mouth, her eyes narrowing. The\nwild vegetables smell so good.\nUnconvinced, Wayi Wu picked up another\none from the plate, hesitated for a\nmoment, and then brought it to his\nmouth. This time, he didn't dare to\nswallow it all at once, and only took\nabout a third of it. Immediately\nafterwards, a stream of fiery red oil\nmixed with spices such as Sichuan\npeppercorns and starannis flowed out\nfrom the dumpling. Unfortunately, his\nbite happened to crush a few\npeppercorns. The already high\ntemperature oral cavity suddenly\nexperienced wave after wave of intense\npleasure like surfing. Yushwan, can you\ntell me, is this thing that tastes like\nhot pot broth also a wild vegetable?\nYoung master, you've had some. Upon\nhearing wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s question, Xiushuan\nnot only did not panic, but instead\nlooked happy. I know the young master\nlikes hot pot, so I especially added\nthis in. Isn't that surprising? Wayi Wu\nstared blankly at Zuyuan for a long\nwhile before finally speaking just\nbecause of this. No, it's just I didn't\nbuy many wild vegetables today, so I\ndidn't have enough filling. I wanted to\nmake something that the young master\nlikes to eat. So, beside the hot hot\nbroth, what else did you add just now?\nZuyushuan gave her answer without any\nhesitation. There's also a black bag.\nI've seen the young master look at it\nseveral times, so I've included it as\nwell. Upon hearing this, we wu put one\nhand to his forehead, inwardly screaming\nwith rage. What terrible things have I\ndone? The problem is Zhu Yushwan is\ncurrently hoping to receive praise and\ncompliments from herself. If we reveal\nthe truth now, will it be so devastating\nthat she'll never dare to enter the\nkitchen again? To be honest, even though\nthere were more than 30 dumplings, I\ndidn't get to eat any wild vegetable\ndumplings. But judging from Zhu Yuswan's\nexpression just now, the taste should be\npretty good. Forget it. I'd better not\nsay anything and just quietly eat the\nother dumplings. It's just that I'm\nreally unlucky otherwise. Thinking of\nthis, Wayiu turned his gaze to Zhu\nYuwan, who was eating her third\ndumpling. Yuwan, could you pick up a\ndumpling for me? Yes, young master. In\nresponse, Zuyuan mimicked Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s\nearlier actions, picking up a dumpling\nand holding it to his mouth. Have to.\nNow I have no choice but to stuff it all\ninto my mouth at once. Weii Wu secretly\ntook a deep breath, enduring the\nincreasing burning sensation in his\nmouth. It took a bite. Two streams of\ntears slid down Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s cheeks, his\nsoul had suffered a second devastating\nblow. \"Young master, why are you crying\nwhile eating dumplings?\" Seeing the tear\nstains on Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s face, Zhu Yuwan\nasked a question, puzzled. We wu\nremained silent. As a young man with\nhemorrhoids, he knew that tonight was\ndestined to be his sleepless night. Just\nas Wei Wu was pondering how to answer,\nthe voice of a servant came from outside\nthe door. Young master, 11 men have\narrived outside. They claimed to be our\nfamily's guards and sent me to report to\nyou. Chapter 66. Help. The young master\nis dying. Upon hearing the voice from\nthe servant, Weii Wu&lt;unk&gt;s eyes finally\nlit up. My benefactor, it must be Shin\nLin and the others. Quick, bring them\nalong. I'll go greet them myself.\nSuppressing his pain, Weii Wu, covered\nin sweat, stroed quickly toward the\ndoor. We must welcome them. The\ndifference in status is nothing. Life is\nthe most important thing. If you take\nanother bite of that dumpling, it might\njust die on the spot. However, just a\nsecond before stepping out the door, we\nwoo turned back and put on a smiling\nface. With a horse voice, he looked\nsincerely at Juyusan and said, \"Yushuan,\nyour dumplings are delicious, but I have\nsomething to do right now. Why don't you\nlet Leah and the others try some, too?\"\nAfter saying that, Wayi Wu didn't linger\nand quickly walked out of the room to\nthe servant. Where were they? With Zu\nYuswan no longer around, Weii Wu finally\nno longer had to endure it. The pain\nthat erupted from my tongue and mouth\nwas clearly reflected in my facial\nexpressions. However, his bloodshot eyes\nand ferocious appearance really\nfrightened the servant. It took him a\nlong while to come to his senses, and he\nquickly replied, \"We'll wait in the\nfront yard, young master. If you don't\nsay anything, I won't dare let them in.\nCome on, take me to see them. Upon\nreceiving the order, the servant\nimmediately turned around and led the\nway. Wayi Wu took the opportunity to\ntake out a bottle of cola from the\nwarehouse and gulp it down. It took\nfinishing a whole bottle of cola to\nfinally dissipate some of the spiciness.\nInside the courtyard, Jean Hai and his\n10 brothers were staring longingly at\nthe gate. Upon seeing Weii Wu appear, he\nimmediately led a group of people to\nhim. Before Wei Wu could speak, all of\nthem knelt down on one knee, completely\ncatching Wei Wu off guard. \"Jang Hai,\nwhat are you doing? Young master, we\nbrothers are grateful for your kindness.\nWe are just commoners, and we can only\nrepay you with our loyalty.\" Wayi Wu\nlooked at them with a mixture of\namusement and exasperation, but he also\nunderstood that Jean Hai was right. The\nmost valuable thing the poor can repay\nthe powerful is loyalty. All right. All\nright. Get up. Remember, there's no\nkneeling ceremony in this room. From now\non, bow to me. From now on, Shunlin will\nbe the captain and Jang Hai, the vice\ncaptain. However, Shan is currently\nrecovering from his injury. So, Jean Hai\nwill lead the team for the time being.\nAfter making arrangements for everyone,\nwe wu turned to look at the servants\nbeside him. Take them to the supervisor.\nTheir monthly salary will be double what\nthey used to be and the captain and\ndeputy captain will be paid three times\nthe amount. The salary of a junior\nofficer in the embroidered uniform guard\nwas seven shure of rice per year which\nis roughly equivalent to 45 tales of\nsilver in cash. The total value of these\n12 people was only 1,170\ntales of silver. Although it seems like\na lot, this expense is definitely\nworthwhile. These were all Ewan division\nofficers who served Zhu Yuan Jang in the\nearly Ming dynasty. Their individual\nabilities far surpassed those of\nordinary guards. Moreover, with\nWayiu&lt;unk&gt;s current financial resources,\nhe could simply do nothing and keep\npaying these people salaries until they\ndie. Last time, Zhu Yuan Jang bestowed\nupon him 5,000 tales of gold, 30,000\npaper money. Tomorrow at the morning\ncourt, titles will be conferred and\nrewards will be given. 5,000 tales of\ngold, 30,000 tales of silver, and 60,000\nstrings of paper money. This is all in\ncash, not including the profits from the\nthree shops and Mayan building, as well\nas a total of 4,000 acres of fertile\nland. After dealing with the guard's\nissue, Wayi Wu turned and walked towards\nhis own courtyard. However, as soon as\nhe reached the gate of the courtyard,\nthat burning sensation that filled him\nwith despair surged up again. Only then\ndid he suddenly realize that Zhu Yuwan\nmight still be waiting for him inside.\nThinking of this, Wayiu did not step\ndirectly into the courtyard, but instead\npoked half his head out to check. Seeing\nthat Yian, Reeba, and Leah were all in\nthe room, Wayi Wu felt relieved and\nstroed in. Upon entering the room, I\nfirst glanced at the table and noticed\nthat there was only one dumpling left.\nAnd just as Dabba was about to put the\ndumpling in her mouth, Wu finally\nbreathed a sigh of relief.\nUnfortunately, he was too happy too\nsoon. As soon as Draaba saw him come in,\nshe immediately picked up some dumplings\nand brought them to him. Young master,\nplease have some. Sister Yusuan's\ndumplings are so fragrant and delicious.\nDoraba always liked to seek praise from\nherself, so Weii Wu wasn't surprised by\nher behavior. However, the white\njade-like dumpling in front of him\nappeared to Woo as if it were emitting\nblack smoke. He could almost see the\nsteaming dumpling talking to him. Eat\nme. Eat me. Give me your soul. In order\nto preserve his soul, Wayi Wu\nimmediately wanted to find an excuse to\nrefuse. However, when he looked up, he\nsaw three little girls, six pairs of\neyes staring at him. expectantly. The\nanticipation in Yu, Shien, and Draaba's\neyes was almost overflowing. There were\nmore than 30 dumplings, and I only ate\nthree of them. The rest were all eaten\nby them. In the end, I was the only one\nwho got infected.\nFrom a probability standpoint, it's\nimpossible for someone to be that\nunlucky. Sometimes people are like that.\nThey don't want to believe that they'll\nalways be the unlucky one. Driven by\nthis gambler's mentality, Weii Wu forced\na smile onto his face. Then he took a\nbig bite and stuffed the dumpling into\nhis mouth. Chewing silent and extremely\nhighfrequency chewing. At this moment,\nWayi Wu retracted his previous thoughts.\nDoes attitude matter? No, not at all.\nWhat matters is whether it tastes good.\nThat's right. Wayu was defeated by\nZhuwan with a triple kill. This is\nanother incredibly tough and ruthless\nopponent. Now he only had one thought in\nhis mind. As long as he swallowed fast\nenough, the spiciness wouldn't be able\nto catch up with him. However, without\nchewing, food is difficult to swallow.\nTime passed slowly, and after struggling\nto swallow the dumplings. Weii Wu&lt;unk&gt;s\neyes welled up with tears again. \"It's\nreally delicious. I have to attend a\nmorning court session tomorrow, so I'm\ngoing back to my room to sleep.\" Forcing\na smile, Wayi Wu replied briefly before\nquickly returning to his bedroom and\nburying himself under the covers. That\nnight, every now and then, we woo\nsuppressed, mournful cries could be\nheard from inside the room. The pain was\nlike having hundreds of incendiary bombs\ndropped and detonated at the foot of\nMount Fuji. A huge red fireball slowly\nemerged from the mountain pass. The\nintense heat turned the area around the\nmountain pass red-hot and lava gushed\nout from the cave entrance. This state\npersisted until 1:15 a.m. before finally\nshowing signs of easing. However, Weii\nWu had no time to rest as he had to\nattend the morning court session that\nday. I shakily climbed out of bed and\nbefore I could even get dressed, I saw a\nbright red stain on the sheets. Wayi Wu\nresponded that this was nothing as the\nchamber pot by the bed was already half\nfull. Just then, Doraba pushed open the\ndoor with a basin of water and saw the\nblood stains on the bed. Upon seeing\nWeey Woos pale, bloodless face, he was\nimmediately terrified. Young master,\nwhat's wrong with you? It's nothing. I\njust accidentally injured my hemorrhoids\nlast night. Wayi Wu couldn't very well\ntalk about hemorrhoids with a young\ngirl, so he could only give her a\nprefuncter answer. After all, how do you\nexplain this? You could say young\nmaster, my hemorrhoids flared up and I\nwas bleeding profusely all night. After\ndealing with Dabba and quickly washing\nup, Wayi Wu was about to change his\nclothes. As soon as he turned around, he\nheard Dilaba's terrified cries from\nbehind him. Oh, young master, what's\nwrong? Young master, someone come quick.\nYoung master is dying. What the heck? Am\nI going to die? How come I didn't know?\nNobody told me. Wayi Wu muttered a\ncomplaint to himself. then suddenly\nturned around and looked at the scene,\nhis face turning as black as charcoal.\nChapter 67. Young Master Way, your\nbuttocks are bleeding. Daba's face was\nfilled with terror, and her finger\ntrembled as she pointed to the blood\nsoaked chamber pot by the bedside. Her\nbig eyes were brimming with tears, which\nkept streaming down her face. Seeing her\nlike this, Wayu wished he could find\nsomething to stuff in her mouth. I just\nhad a hemorrhoid flare up. Why are you\ncursing me like that? While inwardly\ncomplaining, Wayi Wu was also figuring\nout how to gloss over the matter.\nHowever, at that moment, a loud bang was\nheard coming from outside the bedroom as\nif the front door had been violently\nkicked open. Then, a member of the\nImperial Guard was heard shouting\noutside the bedroom door. The Imperial\nGuards are here. Young Master Way, don't\npanic. We're here to rescue you. Holy\ncrap. I just had a hemorrhoid flare up,\nyou idiots. Do you even understand what\nhemorrhoids are? They heard the sounds\ncoming from outside the door along with\nthe approaching footsteps. Weii Wu\nimmediately became anxious and shouted\ntowards the door. Don't come in. I'm not\ndead. No, I'm fine. Fortunately, we woo\nshouted in time and the footsteps\noutside immediately stopped at the gate.\nOnly then did Wei Woo breathe a sigh of\nrelief. If all these people were to rush\nin, wouldn't he lose face? He ruined\nthat chamber pot all night. It's a\ncomplete mess now. A sight too painful\nto look at. Thinking of this, Wayi Wu\nquickly ran to the bedside and hid the\nchamber pod in a place where it could\nnot be seen. Then he turned to look at\nDaba and put his finger to his lips in a\nshushing gesture. Dabba was already\nflustered at this point, her eyes fixed\non the place where the chamber pot was\nhidden, and she didn't notice Wu&lt;unk&gt;s\ngesture. By the time she came to her\nsenses, Wei Wu had already turned around\nand opened the door. As soon as the door\nopened, several Imperial guards rushed\ninto the room, drawing their swords and\nprotecting him. Seeing this, Wayiu\nsecretly breathed a sigh of relief.\nLuckily, my buddy was smart enough to\nhave foresight and hid the things in\nadvance. After confirming that there was\nnothing wrong in the room, the Imperial\nguards she swords and looked at Wayi Wu.\nYoung Master Wei, what exactly happened?\nWhy did Miss Reeba tell you to hurry?\nThe Imperial guards, fearing they might\noffend someone, didn't finish their\nsentence, but they still conveyed their\nmeaning. After hearing what the\nembroidered uniform guard said, Weii Wu\nwas furious. \"Yes, I'm dying. I'm about\nto be driven crazy by this girl.\" While\ninwardly complaining, Weii Wu turned to\nthe embroidered uniform guard, ready to\nexplain. However, before he could speak,\nDaba said from the side, \"Young master,\nyoung master was injured last night. He\nbled a lot. He lost so much blood. After\nDoraba finished speaking, Weii Wu's eyes\nlit up and he continued speaking in\nresponse. All right, I accidentally got\nhurt last night, but I'm fine now. No\nsooner had he finished speaking than the\nImperial Guard standing behind him\nyou're bleeding. How can you be all\nright? Upon hearing this, Wei Wu was\nstunned. He was bleeding. I did bleed\nquite a bit last night, but it's all\nfine now. It's just that my vagina is\nstill hurting. Thinking to himself, Wayi\nWu turned to look at the Imperial guard\nbehind him, only to find that the\nguard's gaze was fixed on his backside.\nFollowing the other person's gaze, Weii\nWu looked down and instantly froze as if\nstruck by lightning. Damn it, I should\nhave realized that if there was blood on\nthe sheets, how could there not be on\nthe pants? Just as Wei Wu remained\nsilent, the Imperial Guard spoke up\nagain. Imperial Guard armor. Based on my\nexperience, this should be an arrow\nwound. Wayi Woo. Oh, really? Imperial\nGuard B? No. I think it was a hidden\nweapon. An arrow wound wouldn't cause\nthis little bit of blood. Wayi Woo.\nActually, I'm not sure either. Imperial\nGuard A. No, a hidden blade can cause\nthis. Imperial Guard C. Could it be a\nblow gun? It's concealed and silent.\nImperial Guards A and B. Yes, very\nlikely. To be honest, upon hearing this,\nWayi Woo was already tempted to strike\nsomeone. The three guys surrounded his\nbutt and spent ages trying to figure out\nwhat had poked him. The blood stain is\nright in the middle. Could it be from\nbeing stabbed by something? If I were\nreally exposed to this position, would I\nstill be standing here being studied by\nyou guys? As we Woos expression\ngradually lost control, the Imperial\nguards spoke up with tense expressions.\nAn assassin broke in last night. Seeing\nthat the more he explained, the worse\nthings got, Wayi Woo simply stopped\ntrying to explain and resorted to\nthreats. I'm in a hurry to get to the\nmorning court session. I'm telling you\nall this matter ends here. No one is\nallowed to tell anyone about it. Do you\nhear me? Without waiting for the\nembroidered uniform guard's reply, Wu\ndirectly drove the man out. He closed\nthe door and gave Dilaba a hard knock on\nthe head, sounding annoyed. After\nchanging his clothes, he hurriedly went\nout and headed towards the palace.\nHowever, after he left, the Imperial\nGuard who had just entered the room were\nin a dilemma. What should we do? Young\nMaster Way was injured while under our\nprotection. His majesty will definitely\nhold us accountable if he finds out. No\nsooner had one of the Imperial Guards\nfinished speaking than another Imperial\nGuard spoke up. But we can't hide it.\nReporting it might get you into jail at\nworst, but hiding it is deceiving the\nemperor, which is punishable by\nbeheading. Then let's report it. Should\nI go or you go? Okay, I'll go. After the\nthree finished their conversation, the\nimperial guard seat immediately ran out\nof the mansion. Meanwhile, in the\npalace, Zhu Yuan Jang, supported by\nUnix, arrived at the rear hall of Funen\nHall. I never imagined that I, Zhu\nChongba, who spent my entire life on the\nbattlefield, would be defeated by such a\nsmall ailment as hemorrhoids. Alas, as\nhe sighed inwardly, the unic had already\narranged a speciallymade cushion and\nhelped Zhu Yuan Jean sit down. Your\nmajesty, there are imperial guards\noutside the palace requesting an\naudience. They say they are from the\nresidence of young master way. Upon\nhearing this, Zhu Yuan Jang immediately\nfrowned. Pass. Then the Imperial Guard\nBang was led into the inner palace by\nthe unic. What is it? Your Majesty Young\nMaster Wei was injured last night and it\nis not yet certain whether he was\nassassinated. There was blood on his\nbody this morning. Because Wei Wu did\nnot personally admit to encountering\nassassins, the embroidered uniform\nguards dared not speak recklessly. When\nZu Yuan Jong heard that Wayi Wu was\ninjured, he suddenly stood up but\naccidentally pulled at his own sore. The\npain made his eye twitch involuntarily,\nbut he couldn't care less about that\nright now. Where is the injury located?\nHow serious is it? Is the person all\nright? Your majesty, young master way Ho\nis injured, but his injuries are not\nserious. He should be waiting in front\nof Taiha gate now. Upon hearing this,\nZhu Yuan Jang did not immediately pursue\nthe matter, but instead gave orders to\nthe palace staff. Guards summon Wei Wu\nto the palace for an audience\nimmediately. As soon as Zu Yuan Jan\nfinished speaking, a unic rushed out of\nthe inner palace. As the Imperial Guard\nBang said, Wayi Wu was indeed waiting in\nthe square in front of Tai Gate. To show\ntheir respect for the emperor, Ming\ndynasty officials would arrive at the\nmorning court session about an hour\nearly. So besides Wayi Wu, there were\nmany other officials around, including\nLie Shan Chong, whom I had met a few\ndays ago. Originally, we would didn't\ntake him seriously and just wanted to\nwait quietly for the morning court\nsession. However, Luchon Chan would\nglance over from time to time, still\nwith that unpleasant look in his eyes.\nWeii Wu, already feeling frustrated, was\nannoyed by his stare and was thinking\nabout whether to give him something\ntough. Unfortunately, before he could\ntake any action, Zhu Yuan Jang&lt;unk&gt;s men\nhad already arrived from the palace.\nYoung Master Wei, his majesty urgently\nsummons you to the palace for an\naudience. Chapter 68. First court\nappearance. Now a noble. Upon hearing\nthis, all the officials around turned to\nlook. They were wondering just now that\nTaiha gate was where civil and military\nofficials waited to attend court. Why is\nthere a stranger here today? Only now\ndid they realize that these were people\nsummoned by the emperor? Then these\npeople started to wonder what would\nhappen at the morning court session.\nAmong these people, Lie Shan Chong was\nthe one who paid the most attention to\nChow Chow. He was one of the few people\nwho knew Weii Woo well and the two did\nnot have a pleasant relationship. Now we\nsee that Chow Chow was summoned to the\npalace by the emperor again and it was\nat this time just before the morning\ncourt session. Luchan Chong couldn't\nhelp but start to speculate, suspecting\nthat it was related to the matter at the\nRoyal Academy of Sciences. Thinking to\nhimself, Luchan Chong turned his head\nand gave a wink to the sensor not far\naway. The latter dared not hesitate and\nwalked silently to Lie Shan Chong&lt;unk&gt;s\nside. Imperial Sensor Hong, please be\nmore alert at the morning court session.\nDo you understand? Lean Chong didn't\neven move his lips, but his voice\nreached Imperial Sensor Hangs ears. The\nsensor then nodded slightly but did not\nsay anything in response. Both of them\nwere seasoned veterans of the official\ndome and some things didn't need to be\nsaid too obviously. With just a few\nwords, one can immediately understand\nwhat the other person means. Moreover,\nImperial sensor Hang also witnessed the\neye contact between Lie Chong and Weii\nWu just now. It was obvious that he was\nbeing instructed to target that young\nman from earlier since sensors have\nspecial privileges. Even if someone says\nsomething wrong in court, the emperor\nwon't easily blame them. As for why this\nimperial sensor listened to Lie Shan\nChong so much, the reason is quite\nsimple. After the Hui Yong case broke\nout in the 13th year of the Hong Wu\nreign, the former Grand Secretary of the\nCensorate was implicated in the case.\nAfterwards, Lie Shan Chan temporarily\nserved as the sensorin chief, but his\ninfluence had already spread far and\nwide. Today, the sensory was reformed by\nZhu Yuan Jang into the sensory, but\nthere were no major changes in the\ninternal officials. The two were\nsecretly plotting something that Weii Wu\nwas completely unaware of. He had\nalready followed the unic into the\npalace gate. Of course, even if he knew,\nhe wouldn't care. Today's events were\nsomething he and Lau had discussed in\nadvance. No matter how this censor\ntargets you, the outcome will not\nchange. If he truly had the ability to\nforce Zhu Yuan Jang to change his mind,\neven wei Wu would have to respect him as\na fearless man led by the unic. Weii Wu\nsoon arrived at the rear hall of\nfunction hall. As soon as I entered, I\nsaw Zhu Yuan Jang sitting behind his\ndesk with a gloomy face. Seeing this, we\nwas still wondering what was wrong with\nZu Yuan Jang when he heard Zu Yuan Jang\nspeak. Do you know who did it? Huh? Who\ndid it? Didn't you say you got injured\nlater? Upon hearing this, Wayi Wu&lt;unk&gt;s\nmentality immediately exploded. Holy\ncrap, who the hell sent this to me, and\nit even got to the palace. Uncle Zu.\nActually, I didn't. In front of Zu Yuan\nJang, we wu had nothing to hide.\nHowever, he had only spoken halfway when\nhe noticed a strange cushion sitting\nunder Zhu Yu and Jangs bottom. This mat\nis actually U-shaped with a hollow\nmiddle section. Upon seeing the mat, a\nguest suddenly popped into Wayi Wu&lt;unk&gt;s\nmind, \"Could it be that I've met a\nfellow sufferer with hemorrhoids?\"\nThinking of this, Wei Wu changed the\nsubject and said in a tentative tone,\n\"Uncle Zu, actually, I'm not injured.\nIt's just that my condition is actually\na case of hemorrhoids and teenagers,\nearly success.\" Zhu Yuan Jang was taken\naback. Just as he was about to ask Wei\nWu what he meant, he noticed that Wei\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s gaze was strange. When talking\nto himself, he doesn't look at himself,\nbut instead stares at his own dragon\nbuttocks. Recalling what we Wu had just\nsaid, Zhu Yuan Jang&lt;unk&gt;s expression\nimmediately turned strange, \"So, you\nweren't assassinated?\" \"No.\" After a\nlong silence, Zhu Yuan Jang touched his\nforehead and said with a helpless\nexpression, \"Can't you be a little more\nreliable? You've made a name for\nyourself, and now the news has even\nreached our Fian Hall.\" In fact, Zhu\nYuan Jang was not the only one who felt\nhelpless. Weii Wu was even more helpless\nthan him. This is such a trivial matter.\nReally, such a trivial matter. Those\nunreliable guys have somehow managed to\ncreate this situation. After a long\nsilence, we wu slowly began to explain.\nUncle Zu, I didn't want to either. I\ncan't control things like success. Some\npeople achieve success at a young age\nwhile others achieve success in middle\nor old age. Hearing Weii Wu&lt;unk&gt;s words,\nZhu Yuan Jang was amused and casually\nmade a joke in return. So, you came here\nto confront us about hemorrhoids in\nperson without waiting for Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s\nreply. Zhu Yuan Jang continued. Since\nthere's nothing else, you can wait here\nin the back hall. The morning court\nsession will first discuss state\naffairs. So, it may take a long time\nbefore it's your turn. You don't look\ntoo good. You didn't sleep well last\nnight. If you're sleepy, take a nap here\nthe desk. We'll send someone to wake you\nup later. After Zhu Yuan Jang finished\nspeaking, he did not wait for Wei\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s reply before having a unic help\nhim to the front hall to attend court.\nThe emperor held court in the main hall\nwhile his ministers slept in the rear\nhall. Only Chow Chow enjoyed such\ntreatment. If it were someone else, they\nwould be punished for even taking a\nshort nap, let alone sleeping. But to be\nhonest, Wayi Wu also quite enjoyed this\nfeeling of being treated differently.\nFortunately, Zhu Yuan Jang did not have\nanyone take the cushion with him when he\nleft. Otherwise, given Weii Wu&lt;unk&gt;s\ncurrent state, even his strongest\ndrowsiness would vanish instantly if he\nsat down. Reaching the cushion, Weii Wu\nslowly sat down, his body slightly bent\nand immediately felt completely\ncomfortable. Listening to the sounds of\ncourt discussions coming from the front\nhall, I unknowingly fell asleep on the\ntable. After an unknown amount of time,\nWeii Wu, who was sleeping soundly,\nsuddenly felt someone patting him. Then\nI heard a high-pitched voice whisper in\nmy ear. \"Young Master Wei, young Master\nWei, get up quickly. His majesty summons\nyou.\" After being tossed and turned all\nnight, we wu now fast asleep. When he\nwas suddenly interrupted, his short\ntemper flared up instantly. \"Whoever\nwants to get up can get up. I'm getting\nup now.\" Wayi Wu was only halfway\nthrough venting his morning grumpiness\nwhen he suddenly woke up with a start,\nremembering that he was in the Imperial\nPalace. Moreover, since today was the\nday he was to be enobled and rewarded,\nhe immediately changed his tune and\nstood up. After tidying up his clothes,\nhe followed the unic around a bend to\nthe main gate of Funen Hall. Summon Wei\nWu to the palace for an audience with\nthe emperor. As soon as he reached the\ndoor, he heard a summons coming from\ninside. Weii Wu strodeed into the main\nhall with a bold and unrestrained air.\nThis humble subject Weii Wu pays his\nrespects to your majesty. May your\nmajesty enjoy boundless blessings and\nmay the Ming dynasty enjoy peace and\ntranquility throughout the land. This\ntime, just like when we Wu met Zu Yuan\nJang before, he only bowed and did not\nkneel down. Although this is just a\nformality, the necessary rules still\nneed to be followed. In formal settings,\none must speak in accordance with\nregulations and use language that is\nappropriate for polite society. After we\nwoo finished bowing, a unic immediately\nstepped forward and loudly announced the\nimperial edict. By the mandate of\nheaven, the emperor decrees, \"In the\n15th year of Han Wu, I receive divine\ngrains and celestial seeds from the\nextraordinary man we woo to aid the fate\nof the Ming dynasty. It can relieve the\nhunger of all people in the world. I'm\ngrateful for his contributions and\nhereby bestow upon him 5,000 tales of\ngold, 30,000 tales of silver, 60,000\nstrings of paper money, 2,000 moo of\nfertile land, and a restaurant.\nEffective immediately, the title of Earl\nof Chong Lu is hereby conferred upon\nverification of the yield perm when the\nimmortal seeds are harvested. The title\nof marquee of Chong Lu shall be further\nconferred. This is the imperial decree.\nThe unic just finished reading the\nimperial edict when Imperial sensor Hang\nimmediately stepped forward from the\nqueue. Your majesty, I have a question\nthat I do not understand. My Gao Gao.\nChapter 69. Confronting the sensor in\nthe imperial court. I have an imperial\nedict. Do you dare to look at it? Zu\nYuan Jang glanced at Imperial Sensor\nHong and nodded. Allow. Upon receiving\nthe emperor's order, Imperial sensor\nHang immediately turned to look at Wei\nWu. Weii Wu, do you hold any official\nposition? Upon hearing this, Wei Wu\nimmediately guessed what this guy was up\nto. Fortunately, he had anticipated this\nmight happen and had made preparations\nin advance. After Imperial Sensor Hang\nfinished asking the question, he simply\nreplied casually. No. Upon hearing Weii\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s reply, Imperial Sensor Hang\nstepped forward and spoke again in a\npressing tone. Since you hold no\nofficial position, do you have any\nacademic achievements? No. I upon\nhearing this, Imperial Sensor Hang took\nanother step forward, his tone becoming\neven sterner. You hold neither official\nrank nor merit. So why did you not kneel\nbefore his majesty upon entering the\npalace? Seeing the man's aggressive\ndemeanor, Wayi Wu burst into laughter\nwithout giving him any face, she\nimmediately retorted. Whether I bow to\nhis majesty, how I bow, and what kind of\nbow I bow to are none of your business.\nWhy should you interfere? After Wei Wu\nfinished speaking, Imperial sensor Hang\nglared at him angrily and said, \"I am an\nimperial sensor with the duty to\nsupervise all officials and maintain\norder in the court. This is my\nresponsibility, so why can't I\ndiscipline you? You yourself said you\nhave the duty to oversee all officials,\nbut the problem is I'm not an official.\"\nHearing Weii Wu&lt;unk&gt;s twisted logic,\nImperial Sensor Hangs chest heaved with\nanger and his eyes blazed with fury.\n\"You.\" However, just as he was about to\nreprimand him, Wayi Wu directly took out\na piece of golden silk cloth and placed\nit in front of him. I have an imperial\ndecree that his majesty has granted\npermission for an audience without the\nneed for kneeling. Do you dare to look?\nI The sensor was interrupted by Wei Woo\njust now, but now he really doesn't know\nwhat to say. They had the emperor's\nspecial permission and they carried the\nimperial edict with them at all times.\nSo what could be said? The key point is\nthat even when we woo showed him the\nimperial edict, he was not allowed to\nlook at it. The emperor's edicts\npossessed the highest level of authority\nand were also confidential. Apart from\nthe emperor and the person receiving the\nimperial edict, no one else was allowed\nto peek at the contents of the edict.\nSince you have both an imperial edict\nand his majesty's special permission,\nwhy didn't you say so earlier? Instead,\nyou're making a scene and disturbing the\ncourt. You think I'm being unreasonable?\nYou think I'm giving you face?\" Wayi Wu\nmuttered a complaint to himself, then\nglanced at Old Jew without making a\nsound. Upon noticing the slight smile on\nOld Jews lips, Wayi Wu couldn't help but\nsigh inwardly. Old foxes are indeed\nshrewd. This is also one of the reasons\nwhy he is unwilling to enter the\nimperial court. The people in this hall\nare all made of scheming minds. Oldju\nhad said before that there would\ndefinitely be officials who would oppose\nthis confirmment of titles. Oldju didn't\nknow exactly how many people would\noppose him, nor did he need to know.\nOnce he press down the first one that\npops up, the others will naturally stop\ncausing trouble. Old Jews current\nattitude clearly shows that he is using\nme to give a warning to those who dare\nto stand out. Now that Wayi Wu knew what\nold Jew was thinking, he didn't care\nabout it anymore. Okay, if you want to\nplay, then I'll just have to play along.\nHaving made up his mind, Wayi Wu looked\nat Imperial Sensor Hong again. Imperial\nSensor is it? First of all, you never\nasked me from the beginning whether I\nhad an imperial edict or his majesty's\nspecial permission, so why should I ask?\nSecondly, you say I'm being\nunreasonable, but I haven't said a\nsingle word since I entered the hall.\nAll my words have been answers to your\nquestions. My humble and polite reply\nhas only been met with repeated\nharassment from you, the Imperial\nsensor, who has ultimately turned the\ntables on me. You have unjustly accused\nme of disturbing the court. Throughout\nhistory, I have never seen such a\nshameless person as you. Huang Yusure\nwas powerless to refute what we Wu said\nbecause it was all true. So at this\ncrucial moment, he simply took the\nshamelessness of a scholar to the\nextreme. Huang Yushir suddenly flicked\nhis sleeve, then turned his head away,\nrefusing to look at Wayi Wu again. You\nbrat, I disdain to argue with you. After\nspeaking, Imperial sensor Hang turned\naround, bowed to Zhu Yuan Jang, and\nsaid, \"Your Majesty, I believe that the\nreward given to Chow Xiao is not\nappropriate. It is against the rules of\npropriety.\" It must be said that these\nsensors really know how to stir up\ntrouble. The Imperial sensor Hang\nimmediately pointed out that this matter\nwas against etiquette. The problem is\nthat the so-called system of rights was\na very broad concept in feudal times.\nNeedless to say, the concept of rights\napplies to everything related to systems\nfrom estate to the family. Moreover, as\nan Imperial sensor, it was entirely in\nline with his duties to say such a\nthing. However, after Imperial sensor\nHang finished speaking, Zhu Yuan Jang\ndid not say anything, but just watched\nsilently because he knew very well that\nImperial Sensor Hang definitely had more\nto say. As expected, Imperial Sensor\nHang then continued, \"Your Majesty, may\nI ask whether the yield per acre of that\ngrain called potato has been verified?\"\nFaced with Imperial Sensor Hangs\nquestion, Zhu Yuan Jang remained silent,\ncontinuing to watch him in silence. This\nsituation immediately made Imperial\nsensor Hang panic. There was no reason\nnot to panic. The emperor before them\nwas no coward like those in the Song\ndynasty who were easily manipulated by\ncivil officials. This guy is the kind of\nperson who can kill someone for 3 days\nand three nights without even blinking.\nMoreover, he was the most powerful\nfounding emperor and who among the court\nofficials was not afraid of him. Seeing\nZhu Yuan Jangs attitude, Imperial sensor\nHang cursedly Shan Shong in his heart\nfor betraying him. All he could do was\nwrithe in powerless rage. Speaking out\nagainst the emperor might at most result\nin being flogged, but wouldn't lead to\nany serious crime. But if we don't do\nthings according to Lee Shan Chong's\nwishes, this narrow-minded scoundrel\nwill definitely hold a grudge. If Lee\nShan Chong takes action against him, he\nwill at least lose his official position\nand might even lose his life. It's a\npity that Imperial sensor Hang didn't\nknow about the relationship between Wei\nWu and Ju Yuan Jang. Otherwise, he\nwouldn't have thought that way. To be\nhonest, given the current situation,\nImperial sensor Hong is now in a\ndifficult position. As an Imperial\nsensor, he could not possibly retract\nhis words in court. But now, Zhu Yuan\nJang just looks and doesn't answer. So,\nhe can only stand there bowing and\nwaiting. If he retreats, it would be\nconsidered disrespectful before the\nemperor, an act of contempt for the Son\nof Heaven, and a crime of deceiving the\nsovereign. If he doesn't retreat, his\nold back will suffer terribly.\nUnfortunately, he couldn't ask Lee Shan\nChong for help at this time, otherwise\nthe emperor would definitely find out.\nAt that time, not only would he offend\nthe emperor, but Leon Chan would also\ndefinitely hold a grudge against him.\nJust as Imperial sensor Hang was feeling\nfrustrated, Zhu Yuan Jang, sitting on\nthe dragon throne, finally spoke. \"Huang\nLang, do you have a problem with our\naward?\" Upon hearing Zhu Yuan Jang&lt;unk&gt;s\nvoice, Huang Lang inwardly groaned,\nrealizing that the emperor was\ndispleased with him. Fortunately, the\nemperor spoke up and he was able to\nstraighten his bent back. Your Majesty,\nsince the founding of the Ming dynasty,\nno one has ever been granted a title or\nreward for meritorious service without\nhaving performed any such service.\nMoreover, matters concerning titles\ncannot be taken lightly. Your Majesty, I\ndare not interfere with the bestow of\nrewards. I am only worried that if the\ngrain yield is poor, bestowing rewards\nin advance may leave a laughing stock\nfor future generations. It would be more\nprudent to first grant Wei Wu an\nofficial position and have him take care\nof the grain and then grant him a title\nafter verifying the yield per acre.\nHowever, after Hong Lang finished\nspeaking, Zhu Yuan Jang only said one\nsentence. Let me ask you again. Do you\nhave any objections to our reward? Upon\nhearing this sentence again, Huang Langs\nbody began to tremble. At this moment,\nLie Shan Chan was nothing. His fear of\nZhu Yuan Jang had reached its peak. Your\nsubject dares not. Dare not? I think\nyou're quite daring. Chapter 70. The\nminister's performance was in vain, and\nLi Shan Chong&lt;unk&gt;s enjoyment was also\nfor nothing. When Weii Wu was secretly\nwatching, Zhu Yuan Jong had a smile on\nhis lips. But now, when he spoke to\nHuang Lang, his face was so gloomy it\nlooked like it was about to drip water.\nGuards, Huang Lang has shown no manners\nand disturbed the court. Drag him out\nand give him 20 strokes of a cane as a\nwarning to others. As soon as Zu Yuan\nJang finished speaking, guards came in\nfrom outside the door and drag Huang\nLang out. Hang Lang, the one being\npunished, was terrified. The wooden\nplanks in the palace are the kind that\ncan break bricks and stones. They're\nincredibly sturdy. If he were to receive\n20 strokes of cane, given Hong Lang's\nsmall stature as a scholar, he wouldn't\nrecover for at least a month. Looking at\nHuang Lang, whose face was pale and who\nwas trembling all over, Wu made no\nattempt to hide the smile on his face.\nAt the same time, he was secretly\nshaking his head in his heart. Old Ju\nwas not just the jajing emperor who only\nknew how to cultivate taoism and refine\nelixirs. He had plenty of power and\nmeans during the judging era. Imperial\npower gradually waned while civil\nofficials gained power and any official\ndared to stand up and criticize the\nemperor. Those scholar officials who\nwere clearly being punished for making\nmistakes all took pride in being\nflocked. They shamelessly elevate\nthemselves to the status of\nremmonstrating officials and honest\nministers, taking pride in it. If you\nask today's officials, would they dare\nto try their luck in front of Xu Yuan\nJong? This old man really goes all out.\nOne try and you'll die. The civil and\nmilitary officials were astonished by\nHuang Langs fate, and at the same time,\nthey understood what Zu Yuan Jang was\nthinking. Meanwhile, Huang Lang, who had\nbeen taken outside, was already being\nheld on a torture bench. For Unix stood\non either side holding rods, but instead\nof carrying out the punishment, they\nlooked at the supervising unic beside\nthem. The supervising unic didn't speak,\nbut simply stood with his toes together.\nUpon seeing this, the executioner\nimmediately understood. There are rules\nfor administering corporal punishment in\nthe palace. Before carrying out the\nexecution, the executioner would first\nobserve the way the supervising unic\nstood on his toes. If they stand side by\nside, it means they are truly the kind\nof assistants who don't need to hold\nback. However, if the supervising Unix's\ntoes are turned outwards, it means that\nhe is carefully controlling the force of\nthe blow. The Unix who carried out the\nexecutions were all rigorously trained,\nand their control over the severity of\nthe blows was so precise that they would\nnever make a mistake. Now that they\nunderstood the coded message given by\nthe supervising unic, the four men dared\nnot hesitate any longer and grabbed\ntheir rods to strike. Smack, smack,\nsmack. A series of sounds of caning and\nflesh-hitting flesh rang out,\ninterspersed with Huang Lang shrill\nscreams. Each strike felt like a blow to\nthe minister's hearts, making them\nextremely nervous. In other words, the\nmilitary officers didn't show any change\nin expression. They were used to being\nbeaten with sticks. The supervising Unix\nunderstood the emperor's mind. They knew\nexactly whether or not to punish him and\nhow to punish him until Huang Lang was\njust used as an example and only needed\nto be punished. That would be enough.\nSo, after 10 strokes of the cane, his\ntoes became V-shaped. The unic who was\nwatching him closely immediately changed\nthe force of the paddle in his hand. It\nstill looks just as heavy and it still\nmakes just as much noise when you hit\nit, but it doesn't actually cause much\ndamage. After Hong Lang had received 20\nstrokes of a cane, the palace servants\ntook him to the Imperial Medical Bureau\nfor treatment. Inside the palace, no one\nstepped forward to question the\ndistribution of the rewards.\nSubsequently, Zhu Yuan Jang issued a\nsecond imperial edict which was read\naloud once again by the unic. By the\ngrace of heaven, the emperor decrees.\nThe Earl of Changel shall establish the\nInstitute of the Great Mink Dynasty with\nthe aim of investigating things. This\nacademy does not grant official titles\nor ranks. Is not influenced by the court\nand is independent of the court, only\nresponsible to the emperor. From this\nmoment forward, I shall assume the\nposition of honorary president of the\nRoyal Academy of Science and Technology.\nVice President Wei Wu shall compile the\nplans and regulations and submit the\nranks and positions to me for approval\nand review. So be it. Weiiu was taken\nback. Old Zu was really going to put all\nthe burden on my shoulders. Just as he\nwas thinking this, Zhu Yuan Jang, who\nwas on the dragon throne, spoke up. How\nwas the work progressing with the\nMinistry of Revenue, the Ministry of\nWorks, and the Ming Dynasty Royal\nScience and Technology Research\nInstitute? Upon hearing this, Zangtai,\nthe Minister of Revenue, and Xiao Jun,\nthe Minister of Works, immediately\nstepped out from the ranks. Xiao Jun was\nabout to speak when Zangtai spoke first.\nYour Majesty, the land and property are\nready, and we are just waiting for the\nEarl of Changangle to come to the\nMinistry of Revenue for handover. After\nZung Tai finished speaking, Xiao Jun\nquickly chimed in. I sent people to\nsurvey outside the city yesterday and\nthe craftsmen expect to complete the\nconstruction of the camp within 15 days.\nIn addition, the list of craftsmen has\nbeen compiled and they're just waiting\nfor the Earl of Changangle to come to\nthe Ministry of Works to hand over their\nduties before they can leave their posts\nand be transferred. However, the\nMinistry of Revenue has not allocated\nany funds. So, the craftsmen are\nstruggling to make ends meet. As a\nresult, the construction of the Academy\nof Sciences has not yet started. Upon\nhearing Xiao Jun&lt;unk&gt;s complaint,\nZangtai immediately began to defend\nhimself. Your Majesty, I have not\nreceived your decree and dare not\narbitrarily allocate funds from the\nMinistry of Finances Treasury.\nFurthermore, the Ministry of Revenues\nTreasury is currently unable to produce\nany silver. I implore your majesty to\ninvestigate this matter thoroughly. Wayi\nWu watched the two perform from the\nsidelines, his heart unmoved. They\nappear to be tearing each other apart,\nbut in reality, they're just shifting\nblame. They said everything was ready\nand they were just waiting for me to\nhand it over, but in reality, nothing\nwas there. What's the use of land deeds\nand farm deeds if the science\ninstitute's headquarters haven't even\nbeen built yet? Is it useful for\nselecting personnel? There's a saying\nthat a minister of revenue who can't\ncomplain about being poor isn't a\ncompetent minister of revenue and that's\nabsolutely true. It's just building a\nscience institute. The craftsmen are\nalready prepared and the ministry of\nrevenue only needs to pay for the\nmaterials. Even so, Zang Tai still had\nto plead poverty in front of Zhu Yuan\nJang, saying that calling him a greedy\nand greedy person was absolutely right.\nOn Xiao Jun's side, the lack of funding\nallowed him to legitimately slack off.\nTo be honest, they all knew very well\nthat since Zhu Yuan Jang had said it had\nto be done, it had to be done. But he\ndeliberately created this to annoy\npeople, specifically to annoy Wayi Wu.\nAs for the reason, it was of course Lie\nShan Chong since their actions were all\nwithin the rules. Zhu Yuan Jang would\nnot punish them for this. At the same\ntime, it also gives Lie Shan Chong a\nstatement since they witnessed the\nconflict between the two. Lie Chong as a\nleader of civil officials was far more\nsignificant than Weii Wu, a minor\nfigure. As it turned out, their approach\nwas indeed correct and Lee Shan Chong\nwas extremely pleased to see Weii Wu\nsuffer a setback. Unfortunately, the two\nof them were destined to put on a show\nfor nothing. And Lee Shan Chong also got\nhis fund for nothing. From the very\nbeginning, neither Wei Wu nor Xhu Yuan\nJang intended to use the Ministry of\nRevenue for accounting. After all, the\nMing Dynasty Royal Science and\nTechnology Research Institute was\npositioned to be responsible only to the\nemperor and not to be controlled by the\nofficials. Otherwise, once bureaucracy\ninfiltrates, you can forget about doing\nresearch and peace. So, after the two\nministers finished speaking, Zhu Yuan\nJang immediately spoke up. The funds\nwill not be drawn from the National\nTreasury. The Ministry of Revenue only\nneeds to keep a detailed record of the\nfunds and expenditures. the funds will\nbe drawn from our private treasury. Upon\nhearing this, Zung Tai and Xiao Jun\nstopped arguing and simultaneously\nexpressed their understanding. Even the\nusually calm and collectively Shan Chong\nhad a slightly gloomy expression at this\nmoment. It wasn't because of Zhu Yuan\nJang&lt;unk&gt;s words, but because Wei Wu\nmade a strange gesture to him. Although\nhe didn't understand what it meant, he\nfelt humiliated. But just as he was\nabout to speak, Zhu Yuan Jang spoke\nagain. If there's nothing else, let's\nadjourn the court. Weii Wu, stay and\ncome with us to the rear hall for a\ndiscussion. After the civil and military\nofficials bowed in respect, the Unix\nhelped Zu Yuan Jang back to the rear\nhall. Weii Wu then arrived at the rear\nhall only to hear Zhu Yuan Jang&lt;unk&gt;s\nquestion as soon as he entered. Shiao\nWu, what did you mean by that gesture\nyou made Shan Chong just now? Chapter\n71, Uncle Zu, land annexation started\nwith you. Weii Wu chuckled and then\ncasually mumbled something. Uncle Zu,\nthat's a greeting gesture. It could be\nused to greet him or it could be used to\ngreet his parents and relatives. Yeah.\nZhu Yuan Jan looked at Wayi Wu\nsuspiciously, clearly not believing what\nhe said. Seeing this, Weii Wu had no\nchoice but to explain again. You see,\nthe middle finger is the longest of the\nfingers, representing a greeting that\nreaches the deepest depths and a sense\nof beauty. Diamond beauty praise. I\nmisspoke just now. Upon hearing this,\nZhu Yuan Jean chuckled, then raised his\nhand and said to Wei Wu, \"If you keep\nspouting nonsense, then we'll try\npraising you.\" Seeing that old Jews\nright middle finger was about to stand\nup. Weii Wu finally spoke up and\nconfessed. Okay, to tell you the truth,\nthat gesture means enter his mother,\nenter his wife, enter his ancestors for\n18 generations. All right, stop joking.\nI called you here because I have\nsomething to ask you. As he spoke, Zhu\nYuan Jang raised his hand and waved and\nall the palace servants in the back hall\nwithdrew on their own. After everyone\nhad left, Zhu Yuan Jang slowly revealed\nhis intentions. Well, we just wanted to\nask you if you have any good ways to\nmake money because our private funds are\na bit tight. We can't get the Japanese\npirates silver mountain for the time\nbeing and the rewards we've given you\nthese days have all come from our own\ntreasury. Our large family costs more\nthan 2 million tales of silver every\nyear just to support them. It's a bit\ntoo much for us. Seeing Zhu Yuan Jangs\nsighing and lamenting appearance, Wayi\nWu had only one thought in his mind.\nThat old scoundrel is wicked. He never\ntells the truth. Indeed, in the early\nMing dynasty, the emperor's personal\nrewards were mostly paid from the\nimperial treasury. It wasn't until the\nMidming Dynasty that the emperors began\nto target the national treasury, trying\nevery possible way to extract money from\nit. But this is the Han Wu era. If it\nwere during the later years of the Hanu\nreign, it would be understandable. But\nnow the country has only been\nestablished for 15 years. The wealth\nconfiscated from the homes of officials\nin Gentry in the previous dynasty's\ntreasury was terrifying. Even if things\ngo wrong, the three major cases of the\nHongu era have already occurred. and Juu\nYuan Jang has already killed off a lot\nof people. The money, land, and shops\nconfiscated from the homes of tens of\nthousands of people. While someone in\nthe national treasury, a considerable\namount also went into the imperial\ntreasury. Now, Zhu Yuan Jang is actually\nsaying he has no money. That's\nridiculous. If it were during the later\nyears of Yonga reign and Zhu D had said\nhe had no money, Wayi Wu might have\nbelieved him. After all, Yonga's\nnorthern expeditions required a huge\namount of financial and material\nresources, as the country was indeed too\npoor to afford to wage war. But old Jew\nwas definitely distressed that his\nsecret stash of money had dwindled and\nwanted to make up for it. It's like Zong\nTai came to you to complain about being\npoor, and you came to me to complain\nabout being poor. What have I become? A\ngod of wealth. Wait a minute. Is this\nold man trying to play the poor card and\nget me to hand over the money I saved\nfor building the science institute? No\nway. Once the money's in my pocket, no\none but my wife can take it away. While\nWeii Wu was inwardly complaining and\nbecoming wary, he also began to think of\na solution. After a long while, Wei Wu\nlooked at Zu Yuan Jang. Uncle Zu, if\nwe're talking about the fastest way,\nit's robbery. But there aren't any\nsuitable targets around. Those small\ncountries are already struggling. And if\nthey send troops to fight, they might\nnot even make back the money they spent\non the troops. Moreover, those\nintellectuals will not allow it. After\nall, they only know how to shout about\nmorality, but they do not care about the\nsuffering of the common people. When it\ncomes to these literati, we woo gets\nangry. No, he should say those selfish\nand self-serving literati. Those\nintellectuals who have changed since the\ngreat Song Dynasty who have lost their\nintegrity and only care about interests.\nThey constantly spout benevolence and\nmorality and talk about being a superior\nnation all because of this empty\nunrealistic reputation. They watch their\nown people suffer rather than bear the\ninfamy of improving their lives. The\nreason for this is simply that they as\nintellectuals are beneficiaries of the\nsystem. They live a life of luxury and\nprivilege. How did those western\ncountries and later generations manage\nto maintain high social welfare levels\nfor over a century? It is because they\nhave plundered vast amounts of resources\nand wealth from around the world that\nthey are able to support their own\npeople. Although his reputation wasn't\ngreat, he did receive and enjoy the real\nbenefits. Thinking of this, Wayi Wu\nchanged his tone and turned his\nattention to Zhu Yuan Jang. No, it's not\nthat they lack compassion for the\npeople. Rather, they are the culprits\nbehind the widespread suffering of the\npeople in the later years of the Ming\ndynasty. At this point, Wayi Wu looked\ndirectly at Zu Yuan Jang. But to be\nhonest, Uncle Zu, you also bear some\nresponsibility here. Upon hearing this,\nZhu Yuan Jang's eyes widened and he\nimmediately wanted to speak in defense.\nBut Wayi Wu spoke again, not giving him\na chance to speak. Uncle Zu, didn't you\nwant to know how to make money? If a\nnational treasury's tax revenue is high,\nwon't your private treasury also become\nricher? Upon hearing this, Zhu Yuan Jang\nnodded. Although the imperial treasury's\nrevenue sources included imperial\nestates, local tribute, customs duties,\nmining taxes, fines, and atonement\npayments. However, it is true that every\nyear a portion of the taxes collected\nand submitted to the Ministry of Revenue\nwas sent to the emperor's private\ntreasury. Seeing Zhu Yuan Jang nod, Weii\nWu deliberately asked a question as if\nto keep everyone in suspense. What Uncle\nZu wants to ask most right now is how to\nincrease tax revenue, right? Zu Yuan\nJang nodded again and then Weii Wu\ncontinued, \"But what I want to say is,\nhow can we prevent taxes that should be\ncollected from being lost due to cunning\ntricks? As a result, in the future, the\ncommon people will have no land to\ncultivate, and without harvests, they\nwill be unable to pay taxes, leading to\na deficit in the national treasury. Upon\nhearing this, Zhu Yuan Jang couldn't\nhelp but retort, \"How could the people\nhave no land to cultivate? In order to\nensure that the people have food to eat,\nwe issued an edict at the beginning of\nthe founding of the country to encourage\nthem to reclaim wasteland. and it was\nstipulated that all those who reclaimed\nWasteland would be exempt from rent and\ntaxes for 3 years. But this benevolent\npolicy has become a disaster. Weii Wu\nshook his head and said affirmatively,\n\"This is benevolent governance, not a\ndisaster. However, no amount of land can\nstop greedy people. What use is land if\nit is not in the hands of the people?\" I\nexplained to you, Uncle Zu, how the Ming\ndynasty declined. But there is one thing\nI didn't say. It's not that I did it on\npurpose, but land annexation is a\nproblem that almost always occurs at the\nend of every dynasty. However, to be\nhonest, the land annexation situation in\nthe late Ming dynasty was relatively\nserious compared to other dynasties in\nhistory. Upon hearing this, Zhu Yuan\nJang was displeased. This is something\nthat has happened in every dynasty. So\nwhy is he being blamed for this?\nHowever, Wayi Wu guessed what he was\nthinking and directly explained the\nreason. Uncle Zu, you once issued an\nedict granting scholars certain\nprivileges. I won't go into other\ndetails, but let's just talk about\nwhat's related to taxation. Those who\nhave achieved academic success are\nexempt from labor service and taxes. A\nscholar who has passed the imperial\nexamination can own up to 80 acres of\nland without paying taxes. The Jiren\nsuccessful candidates in the provincial\nexaminations are exempt from taxes on\n400 mu of land while the Geneure\nsuccessful candidates in the imperial\nexaminations are exempt from taxes on up\nto 2,000 mu of land. That's why I say\nyou also bear responsibility because\nthis was the beginning of land\nannexation in the Ming dynasty. Weiiwood\nonly just begun speaking when Zhu Yuan\nJang&lt;unk&gt;s face turned terrifyingly\ngrim. But this was just the beginning\nbecause every word that followed would\npierce Zhu Yuan Jang&lt;unk&gt;s heart.\nChapter 72 of 10 households, nine have\nno land. Because of this decree,\nscholars began to take advantage of this\npreferential treatment and accept the\nservice of others. The wealthy merchants\nas well as those who could not afford or\nwere unwilling to pay taxes put their\nland in their names. In this way, they\nwon't need to pay land tax only pole\ntax. But how much pole tax can be\ncollected? Indeed, Zhu Yuan Jang\nunderstood what we Wu was saying. Land\ntax was the most important item among\nthe national taxes. He never imagined\nthat his preferential treatment of\nscholars would become one of the\ntriggers for the downfall of the\ncountry. Just as Yu Yuan Jang was deep\nin thought, Wayi Wu&lt;unk&gt;s voice rang in\nhis ears again. Your majesty, as you\nknow, the south is rich and prosperous,\nand Jang Nan is a major grain producing\nand taxpaying region. Most scholars come\nfrom the south. Most of the civil\nofficials in the court came from the\nsouth and had close ties with the gentry\nin various parts of Jang Nan, and they\noften corresponded with each other.\nThey're just teachers and students or\nfriends now, but they will develop into\na huge faction with vested interests\nlater on. At this point, Wayi Wiu looked\nat Zu Yuan Jang with a serious\nexpression. Uncle Zu, with your power as\nthe founding emperor, even rats dare to\nhide in the gutter, and no one dares to\ncause trouble. But the future is\nuncertain. During the mid to late Ming\ndynasty, the gentry and civil officials\nwere intertwined, and their influence\neven surpassed that of the emperor. Once\nthese interest groups grow stronger,\nthey may not be able to influence the\nprovincial and imperial examinations,\nbut they will have the final say on the\nperfectional and provincial\nexaminations. Upon hearing that the\npower of civil officials had surpassed\nthat of the emperor, Zhu Yuan Jang&lt;unk&gt;s\neyes began to gleam with murderous\nintent. The reason he abolished the\nsecretariat in the prime minister system\nwas to achieve a high degree of\ncentralization of imperial power. He\nnever complained. no matter how tired he\nwas. However, in Chow Chow's\ndescription, the civil official group\nwould eventually suppress the imperial\npower. Then all he's doing now is in\nvain. Isn't it? The consequences of\npowerful civil officials can be seen in\nthe incompetent Song Dynasty. As Zu Yuan\nJang was pondering this, Wayi Wu&lt;unk&gt;s\nvoice came from beside him again. Uncle\nZu, do you know why Emperor Chong\ncouldn't even pay the army's wages? It's\nbecause nine out of 10 households in the\ncountry have no land. Of all the\nhouseholds in the land, nine have no\nland. Upon hearing this, Zhu Yuan\nJang&lt;unk&gt;s expression became even more\nsolemn, for he himself had experienced\nhunger. He knew better than anyone what\nthe consequences of not owning land\nwould be. He had almost starved to death\nbefore he chose to rebel. If the late\nMing dynasty was truly, as we wu\ndescribed, then the fall of the country\nwas almost inevitable. The common people\ndon't even have farmland. So where does\nthe state collect land tax? Those who\nown large amounts of land don't need to\npay taxes at all. At first, they simply\npromoted a large number of scholars with\nofficial titles who then converted their\nland into land for service, thus\nexempting them from paying taxes. But\nthen they weren't satisfied with just\nnot paying taxes. Instead, they tried\nevery means to seize other people's land\nwhile refusing to pay taxes. At this\npoint, Wayi Wu became thirsty and took\nout two bottles of Sprite, handing one\nof them to Zhu Yuan Jang. However, at\nthis moment, Zhu Yuan Jang was in no\nmood for a drink. All he want to know\nnow was how those beasts had wre havoc\non his great Ming dynasty. Fortunately,\nWeiu didn't keep him waiting long. After\ndowning half the bottle in one go, he\ncontinued speaking. Those gentry and\nwealthy merchants controlled a lot of\nwealth and some of them colluded\ndirectly with local officials to\nforcibly buy land from the people at low\nprices. Or they could join forces to\nhoard grain and manipulate prices,\neasily turning it over and leaving\npeople with no way to survive, forcing\nthem to mortgage their land to stay\nalive. If they use the same method again\nnext year, those fields will become\ntheirs. Some even forcibly seized them,\nleaving the people with nowhere to seek\njustice. Zhu Yuan Jang knew perfectly\nwell why there was nowhere to seek\njustice. As the saying goes, the common\npeople cannot fight against officials.\nBack when he was still unknown, he too\nwas driven to desperation by former Yuan\nofficials. This is also one of the main\nreasons why he is so harsh on officials.\nWith this in mind, Zhu Yuan Jang began\nto ponder how to deal with the problem.\nHe had to provide the people with a way\nto seek redress and officials couldn't\nobstruct it. If we Wu could hear Zhu\nYuan Jang&lt;unk&gt;s thoughts, he would\ndefinitely say that he had indeed come\nup with a solution. In the 18th year of\nthe Han Wu reign, a great edict was\ncompiled. People carried the edict on\ntheir heads to the capital to appeal to\nthe officials, and no one was allowed to\nobstruct them along the way. Ordinary\npeople could even storm into the\ngovernment office, tie up corrupt\nofficials, and bring them to the capital\nto file a complaint. Unfortunately, this\nthing was only useful while Zhu Yuan\nJang was alive. After he died, it was\nworthless, not even worth a piece of\nwaste paper. The officials were\nunwilling to have a sword hanging over\ntheir heads. So, Zhu Yun as soon as he\nascended the throne, urged them to put\nthe sword on a shelf. While Zhu Yuan\nJang was deep in thought, Wayi Wu was\nstill continuing his work. At first, it\nwas just officials and gentry who\nencroached on fertile land. But then the\nimperial estates, royal estates, and\nnobles all got involved. The people\nsuffered terribly, and with the added\nimpact of the Little Age, people in\nvarious places could only eat tree bark,\nclay, and even exchange their own\nchildren to eat. Uncle Zhu, what does it\nlook like to be on the verge of\nstarvation? Surely no one among the\ncivil and military officials of the Ming\ndynasty knows better than you. Zhu Yuan\nJang remained silent. His entire family\nof 10 had starved to death. Who could\nhave felt this more deeply than him?\nAfter a long while, he slowly opened his\nmouth and uttered a sentence. A person\non the verge of starvation is worse than\nan animal as long as they can live. Zhu\nYuan Jang only spoke halfway through\nsentence, but Wayi Wu did not press him\nfurther, instead continuing, \"They can\neat anything, grassroots, soil, tree\nbark, and some people even eat clay when\nthey're starving until they choke to\ndeath.\" The practice of exchanging\nchildren for food is not just a few\nwords in a book, but a pile of meat that\nis cooked alive in a pot to fill their\nstomachs. Bang. Enough. Weu had only\nspoken halfway when Zhu Yuan Jang\nsuddenly slammed his hand on the table\nand shouted in a low voice. In fact, Wei\nWu understood that Zhu was not angry\nwith him, but rather that painful\nmemories from the past have been stirred\nup. No one knows what old Ju ate to\nsurvive when he was a beggar, and there\nwill be no record of it. These things\nwill only exist in memory. Human flesh\nis unlikely, but other things are hard\nto say. But that was Chow Chows purpose.\nOtherwise, a simple phrase like starving\ncorpses everywhere would suffice, and\nthere would be no need to go into such\ndetail. Only by reminding Zhu Yuan Jang\nof the excruciating pain of his family,\nstarving to death, could his blade be\nmade sharper. After calming down for a\nwhile, Zhu Yuan Jang composed himself\nand looked at Wayi Wu slowly asking him\nquestion. Land annexation is an\nunavoidable issue in every dynasty.\nShiao Wu, do you have any feasible\nsolutions for future generations? Upon\nhearing Zhu Yuan Jan&lt;unk&gt;s words, Weii\nWu slowly shook his head. Even in the\nworld 600 years from now, there is no\nperfect way to solve the problem of land\nannexation. But in our time, people no\nlonger needed to rely on farming to\nsurvive. The focus was more on\ndeveloping the economy. Land annexation\nstems from human greed. No matter what\npolicies are introduced, they're only\ntemporary and will eventually be\nexploited. At this point, Wayi Wu paused\nfor a moment before continuing. However,\nthere's a way that can make the national\ntreasury full in the short term and\nensure that the national treasury\nreceives taxes in the long term so as\nnot to be in deficit. Chapter 73. What\nthe heck? Old Ju called Judy back. For\nZhu Yuan Jang, we wu&lt;unk&gt;s words were\nlike a roller coaster ride. The first\nfew sentences plunged him into despair,\nbut the next sentence sent him soaring\nto new heights. After Wei Wu finished\nspeaking, he couldn't wait to ask a\nquestion. What method is that? Seeing\nold Jews flustered appearance, we wu\nchuckled inwardly. Perhaps only I, the\nyoung master, could elicit such emotions\nfrom this emperor. Of course, despite\nthe laughter, after mentally considering\nhis words, Wu immediately spoke. First,\nabolishing preferential treatment for\nscholars can exempt them from Corv\nlabor, and the government can even\nprovide them with some subsidies every\nmonth. But land tax must not be exempted\notherwise the practice of contributing\nland to the state will inevitably occur\nwhich will still lead to a decrease in\nnational tax revenue. In fact, Zhu Yuan\nJang already had ideas about this. His\nbiggest concern right now is the issue\nof land annexation and fortunately Wu\nbrought up that point next. Secondly,\nabolish the pole tax. No, not abolish\nit, but combine the pole tax with the\nland tax. In the late Ming dynasty,\nthere was a decree that required the\nnumber of men to be paid according to\ntheir rations. But unfortunately, due to\nthe decline of imperial power, this\ndecree failed to take effect. LaterQing\nemperors used this as a basis to\nformulate the policy of equalizing the\npole tax and land tax, which effectively\ncurbed land annexation. Should the pole\ntax be incorporated into the land tax?\nUpon hearing this word, Zhu Yuan Jang\nroughly understood its meaning from the\nliteral meaning and Weii Wu&lt;unk&gt;s\nexplanation. I just heard about it and\nhaven't quite figure out the benefits of\nhis decree yet. Fortunately, at this\nmoment, we woo spoke up again to clear\nup his doubts. The pole tax was\nconverted into a land tax, ending the\npole tax that had been in place in China\nfor thousands of years. Taxes were\nlevied based on the amount of land\nactually owned. This method of taxation\ncan effectively reduce the tax burden on\npeople who have no land or little land\nand promote rapid population growth.\nJust as we was about to continue, Zhu\nYuan Jang suddenly reached out and\ninterrupted him. Wait, Xiaawu, what do\nyou mean by rapid population growth?\nUpon hearing this, we wu smiled slightly\nand then explained. Uncle Zu, I know you\nordered people to verify the yellow\nregister records compiled at Hoku, but\nthose do not represent the actual\npopulation. In fact, because of the\nexistence of the pole tax, many people\nwithout land or income went into hiding\nand became unregistered households. Once\nthe pole tax is implemented, the pole\ntax will no longer need to be paid and\nthese hidden households will be\nreleased. Once these extra people\nintegrate into society, they can find\nwork to support themselves, which is\nbeneficial to economic development. Zhu\nYuan Jang nodded knowingly. Indeed, in\nthis era, population was the labor\nforce. Then we wu continued,\n\"Originally, in order to escape the\ngovernment's accountability, they could\nonly hide and be oppressed by the\nlandlords, working as tenant farmers\njust to get a bite to eat. From now on,\nthere's no need to hide anymore. If\nlandlords want people to cultivate their\nfields, they have to hire them with real\nmoney. At worst, I can do some\nhandiccrafts, chop firewood in the\nmountains, catch fish in the river, and\nsell them in the city to make money,\nwhich will be enough to support myself.\nAfter listening to what Wei Wu said, Zhu\nYuan Jang gradually understood the\nbenefits of merging the pole tax into\nthe land tax. This taxation method was\nindeed very effective in curbing land\nconsolidation. The more land a landlord\nowned, the more taxes he had to pay.\nThen their desire to seize other land\nwould be much less, and they wouldn't\nresort to any means necessary. Without\nthe tax exemption privileges of\nscholars, these landlords would have to\npay taxes obediently, thus ensuring the\ntax revenue of the national treasury.\nThis should be what we woo meant by\nmaking money in the long run so that the\nnational treasury can collect taxes.\nHowever, with this in mind, Zhu Yuan\nJang became more interested in methods\nto quickly replenish the national\ntreasury. The equalization of land tax\nand pole tax is indeed a good method,\nbut it will take time to implement.\nLet's talk about the short-term increase\nin the national treasury first. Upon\nhearing Zhu Yuan Jang&lt;unk&gt;s words, Wayi\nWu immediately laughed. Sorry, you rich\nlandlords. Your hard times are about to\nbegin. After making a sarcastic remark\nto himself, we woo finally spoke. In\nfact, the short-term solution is also\nrelated to the land tax reform. Uncle\nZu, you know that any reform will\ninevitably be hated. The conversion of\nland tax to pole tax is tantamount to\nshaking the foundations of those\nlandlords and gentry, and they will\ndefinitely jump up and down to find\npeople to oppose it. At that time, not\nonly will there be resistance from the\npeople, but many officials in the\nimperial court will also oppose it, but\nyou certainly won't care, right? At this\npoint, Wayiu deliberately raised an\neyebrow. And Juuan Jang chuckled in\nresponse. In other circumstances, he\nwould indeed have to pay attention to\nthe attitudes of the officials and could\nnot act unilaterally in everything. But\nthis beneficial policy for the country\nand its people could bring blessings to\nfuture generations for centuries and\neven extend the life of the Ming\ndynasty. In this situation, anyone who\nopposes him is going against him, which\nis tantamount to forcing him to unleash\nhis murderous intent. At this moment, we\nwoo like a little devil kept teasing Zhu\nYuan Jean. Uncle Zu, think about it. Who\nwould obstruct the implementation of\nthis policy? It must be the wealthy\nmerchants, landlords, and gentry in Jang\nNan. They are all incredibly wealthy.\nObstructing national policy is a heinous\ncrime. It wouldn't be an exaggeration to\nconfiscate their property and\nexterminate their entire families.\nHowever, his highness, the crown prince,\nis kind and benevolent. He will surely\ntry to dissuade him if he learns of\nthis. Please, for his sake, punish only\nthe wicked. The key is to confiscate\ntheir property. The wealthy people of\nJang have all their property deeds, land\ndeeds, farm deeds, shops, gold, silver,\njewelry, antiques, and calligraphy, and\npaintings, which are all being used to\nfill the national treasury and the\nimperial treasury. The more we Wu spoke,\nthe brighter Xi Yuan Jang&lt;unk&gt;s eyes\nbecame. He nodded his head from time to\ntime, indicating that he fully agreed\nwith what we wu said. However, this was\nnot the end. After discussing the\nconfiscation of property, Wayi Wu\ncontinued to guide the conversation.\nWith money in the national treasury, we\ncan build large ships and train a navy,\nthen head straight for the Japanese\npirates and take that silver mountain.\nZhu Yuan Jang nodded vigorously, clearly\nextremely satisfied. In the future, the\nsea ban will be lifted, allowing private\norganizations to trade by merchant\nships, and the Imperial Court may even\norganize large-scale caravans. We'll go\noverseas to conduct large-scale trade,\nthen reestablish the maritime trade\noffice to control the ports, and we'll\nbe raking in tariffs and commercial\ntaxes until our hands cramp. Upon\nhearing this, the look of being fooled\non Zhu Yuan Jang&lt;unk&gt;s face immediately\ndisappeared. When he turned to look at\nWeii Wu, his face was full of amusement.\nYou brat, I asked you to talk about\ntaxes, and you've taken this to the\nextreme. without waiting for Wei\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s reply. Zhu Yuan Jang continued,\n\"Don't worry, we won't go back on our\npromise to send troops to fight the\nJapanese pirates.\" \"Also, we won't miss\nout on the age of exploration you\nmentioned. Now that we know how rich and\nprosperous the overseas world is, how\ncould our great Ming possibly miss out,\nbut now is not the time, so don't rush.\"\nUpon hearing this, Wayi Wu scratched his\nhead and smiled, looking as if he knew\nnothing. But in reality, he did hope to\nlift the sea ban and not just lift the\nsea ban, but to directly establish\ncolonial rule. If you can't use\ntechnological superiority to crush\nweaker opponents in Earth online, then\ndeveloping technology is just like\nwearing fine clothes in the dark. Of\ncourse, he wasn't saying that the C band\nshould be lifted right now. He was just\nreminding old Jew from time to time.\nOnce he successfully developed the steam\nengine that would mark the beginning of\nthe Ming dynasty's rise to prominence\noverseas. Having said all that needed to\nbe said, Wayi Wu had no intention of\nlingering in the palace. However, at\nthis moment, Zhu Yuan Jang suddenly\nspoke up. By the way, we've called the\nfourth brother back. They'll be heading\nto the capital in the next few days. We\nwas taken aback upon hearing this. What\nthe heck? Old Jew summoned Judy back.\nChapter 74. Old Jew, the four great\nevils of the early Ming dynasty were all\nyour sons. What Xiao Cha couldn't\nunderstand the most was why did Jud call\nZhu D back and specifically tell him\nwhat he meant. Just as we was puzzled,\nZhu Yuan Jang spoke again. Xiao Wu, we\nwant to know how future generations will\nevaluate our reinstatement of the feudal\nsystem. It can only be said that\nopinions are mixed, but the negatives\nfar outweigh the positives. Upon hearing\nwei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s reply, Zhu Yuan Jang&lt;unk&gt;s\nexpression remained unchanged, showing\nremarkable composure. Tell us what your\nopinion is, whether it's praise or\ncriticism. Bow. The princes guard the\nborders to protect the frontiers of the\ngreat Ming. Anything else? Is there\nanything else? Zu Yuan Jang&lt;unk&gt;s face\ndarkened from his previous calm. There\nis none left. It's gone. Wayi Wu\nresponded with a sentence, then sighed\nbefore explaining. Uncle Zu, you may\nhave countless reasons to do this, but\nfacts have proven that it is wrong.\nLeaving aside the Jing campaign of\nPrince Yanju, let's talk about your four\nsons who were later known as the four\nevils of the early Ming dynasty. When\nWayi Wu uttered the term for evils, Juan\nJang&lt;unk&gt;s eyes nearly popped out of\ntheir sockets. What kind of nonsense is\nthis? That your own son has become one\nof the four evils. However, when we Woo\nsaw his expression, the words he was\nabout to say stopped in his throat.\nAfter thinking about it, I think it's\nbetter to give him a heads up in\nadvance. Hey, Uncle Zu, let's make this\nclear first. You can't take your anger\nout on me now that I've said it, or I'll\ncomplain to my aunt. You brat, we won't\ntake it out on you, but don't bring up\nyour aunt to intimidate us. Zu Yuan Jang\nsaid two words to the stinky Shiao gang,\nand then he saw Wayi Wu stand up. He\nlooked like he was about to get up and\nrun away to Cunning Palace. So, he\nimmediately changed his tone. Seeing\nthis, Wayi Wu looked at Zu Yuan Jang\nsuspiciously, but then sat back down.\nDon't blame me. All those messes were\ncaused by your son who told you to grant\nthiefs. The emperor is far away, and\nthey can't do anything about it. All\nright, stop with the nonsense and tell\nme right now, why are they called the\nfour evils? Before Weii Wu could finish\nspeaking, Zhu Yuan Jang waved his hand\nto interrupt him. Seeing this, Wei Wu no\nlonger held back and directly announced\nthe names of the four evils. They are\nZhu Xwang, who is utterly wicked. Zhu\nTan, who is utterly evil, Zu Gay, who is\nfierce and wicked, and Zuyu, who is\nextremely vicious. Oh, by the way, Zuyu,\nyou don't know. He's still in your\nbelly. He won't be born until the 21st\nyear of Hung Wu&lt;unk&gt;s reign. Then let me\nstart with Princehuang ofQin. You\nrecently sent a letter to him rebuking\nhim and expressing your dissatisfaction,\ndidn't you? Zhu Yuan Jang was takenback.\nHe had indeed sent someone to deliver a\nletter scolding his second son. But was\nthat important? Later generations could\nonly guess at the cause of death of\ntheir sister, son, and grandson. The\nking ofQen was the second son. Yet the\nrecords are so clear. Is his business\nmore important than his own sister, the\ncrown prince of the Ming dynasty and the\nimperial grandson? Weii Wu, unaware of\nZhu Yuan Jang&lt;unk&gt;s thoughts, simply\nsighed softly and continued. You rebuked\nhim for not listening to you after he\ntook up his post for engaging in\nlarge-scale construction projects that\nwasted manpower and resources, but you\ndon't know that this is nothing at all.\nThis wicked King Sheen favored his\nsecond concubine while imprisoning his\nprincipal wife. He also privately made a\nfiveclaw dragon bed and empress's robes\nto give to his second concubine, Lady\nDeng. These things had not yet happened,\nbut Zu Yuan Jang was not surprised by\nthem. Zu Yuan Jang knew his son's\ncharacter best. However, what Wayu said\nnext made Zu Yuan Jan begin to doubt\nwhether he really understood this son.\nHe took pleasure in torturing his\nservants in his thief, cutting out their\ntongues, freezing them to death in the\nsnow, starving them to death by tying\nthem to trees, and burning them to\ndeath. Finally, fearing that these\npeople would go to the capital to file a\ncomplaint and expose his evil deeds, he\nactually killed them all. Whether it was\ndue to his extreme evil deeds or some\nother reason, in the 28th year of Han\nWu, the prince of Chin was poisoned to\ndeath by three old women. At this point,\nWayi Wu turned to look at Zhu Yuan\nJang&lt;unk&gt;s expression and immediately\nfelt it was best not to say anything\nmore. But just as he had this thought,\nhe heard Zhu Yuan Jang&lt;unk&gt;s chilling\nvoice. Go on. Seeing this, we Wu had no\nchoice but to take out a bottle of\nnitroglycerin pills and place it beside\nhim, then continued. After the death of\nKing Xuang ofQin, you believe that he\ndeserved to die, so you ordered that his\nfuneral be scaled down and wrote a\neulogy. Your country has no good\nreputation. You associate with petty\nmen, indulging in debauchery and whine.\nYou wreak havoc within your borders,\nincurring the wrath of heaven. Despite\nrepeated admonitions, you never learned\nyour lesson, leading to your own demise.\nThough you are dead, my guilt is clear.\nAfter we wu finished speaking, it was\nobvious that Zhu Yuan Jang&lt;unk&gt;s cheeks\nbulged and the veins on his neck were\nbulging. Seeing this, we was about to\nspeak when Zhu Yuan Jang suddenly\nroared. Guards, convey my decree. Prince\nZuang ofQin is to proceed to the capital\nat top speed without stopping along the\nway. Tsk tsk tsk. Someone's about to be\nin big trouble. As soon as Zu Yuan Jang\ngave the order, Wei Wu chuckled to\nhimself. Although he knew that Zhu Yuan\nJang would never kill his own son, it\nwas still right to punish Yuan. This\nperson know this guy is absolutely\ndespicable. He's worse than an animal\nfor being born a human. After giving the\norder, Zhu Yuan Jang looked at Wayi Wu\nagain. There are three more. Tell me, we\ncan handle it. Let's start with the ones\nwho have committed all sorts of evil\ndeeds. What are you going to say? If you\nkeep talking, I'm afraid you'll have a\nstroke. Uncle Zu, how about we forget\nabout it? After all, the other two are\nstill small, and the third one hasn't\neven been born yet. Explain. Weii Wu\nsighed softly, then continued. After\nleaving the capital to take up his\nthief, Princehuan of Lu became obsessed\nwith cultivating immortality and\nrefining elixirs. He captured hundreds\nof boys, castrated them, and used them\nas medicinal ingredients for alchemy.\nThe prince of Dai did no good deeds in\nhis life. In his later years, he took a\nhammer and axe and his two sons and went\nout into the street to kill people. He\nlaughed wildly after killing them and\nfound pleasure in it. Prince Zu, he\nloved martial arts and carried swords\nwith him to kill people in the streets\nto the point that everyone in Lo Yang\nwas in danger and the city was\npractically deserted. Unlike before,\nWayi Wu only gave a brief description of\nthese princes. Zhu Yuan Jang understood\nthat since Wei Wu was unwilling to talk\nabout it, he did not intend to ask\nfurther. In any case, you can tell what\nkind of people the remaining three\nvillains are from these few words.\nFortunately, these last few are still\nyoung, and there is still room for\ncorrection. We will think about how to\ndeal with them later. As for Zhu Xwang,\nZhu Yuan Jang&lt;unk&gt;s gaze fell on the\njade belt at his waist when he thought\nof this person. After a long silence, he\nfinally let out a long sigh and\nexplained why he had summoned Judy back.\nShia Wu, actually, I've been studying\nyour world map for the past 2 days, and\nI have an idea in mind. There are such\nvast lands overseas. So let's infect our\nsons overseas and let them occupy all\nthese places. Even if they have the will\nin the future, it will be difficult for\nthem to cross this vast ocean. If\nsomething really happens, they'll have\nto let the meat rot in the pot. It must\nbe said that even we Wu did not expect\nZhu Yuan Jang to say such a thing. In\nfact, that was what he was thinking,\ntoo. Rather than worrying about the\nprinces rebelling, it would be better to\nsend them to their thiefs overseas. Even\nif those four villains want to cause\nharm, they will harm outsiders. We don't\ncare about those who are not of our\nrace. However, this was ultimately a\nfamily matter for Zhu Yuan Jang, and\nWayu would not voluntarily get involved\nin such a matter. Now that Zhu Yuan Jang\nhad brought it up, Wayi Wu immediately\nthought of what he had said before.\nUncle Zu, you summon the prince of Yen\nback. Surely you don't intend for him to\nbe the first to be in theft overseas.\nChapter 75. Is old Ju planning to send\nJudy to Australia? As soon as we Wu\nfinished speaking, he saw Zhu Yuan Jang\nlooking at him. What you think? Let it\ngo out. It's much better for them to\nwreak havoc on foreigners than to harm\ntheir own people here. We Wu thought to\nhimself, but did not give a direct\nresponse. Uncle Zu, this is your family\nmatter. How can I, an outsider,\ninterfere? You could decide for\nyourself. Upon hearing Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s\nreply, Xiau Jang&lt;unk&gt;s eyes widened. Are\nyou an outsider? Which brat was it who\nthreatened us with his aunt just now?\nWell, that's not very nice of you to say\nlike that. She's my own aunt. Nonsense.\nShe's still my own wife. Tell me. Seeing\nthat Zhu Yuan Jang was determined to get\nto the bottom of things, we wu decided\nto play a little trick. Uncle Zu, please\ntell us why you thought of having the\nprince of Yan go to his thief first. Zhu\nYuan Jang gave Wei Wu a disapproving\nlook, but still answered his question.\nDidn't you say that fourth brother's\nmartial arts are better than ours? Since\nhe's so good at fighting, who else\nshould we choose? While Zhu Yuan\nJang&lt;unk&gt;s reasons were indeed very\nvalid, Wayi Wu felt there was another\nreason. It was precisely because Zhu D\npossessed exceptional military talent\nthat Zhu D considered getting rid of him\nfirst. He didn't want to see his son and\nhis brothers kill each other over the\nthrone. After all, the position is too\ntempting and sometimes even if the\nperson has no interest in it, they could\nbe instigated by others to have their\nambitions stirred up. Sending Jud to a\nFFTM overseas would mean that even if he\nhad any ambitions, he could only dream\nabout it from across the ocean.\nDeveloping influence overseas takes at\nleast several decades. The development\nspeed of the Ming dynasty's homeland far\nexceeded that of overseas. Just as Weii\nWu was speculating, Zhu Yuan Jang spoke\nagain. We want to send our fourth son to\nthat place called Australia. It has\nenough land and resources for him to\ndevelop. Good heavens. Does old Jew love\nyou D or hate him? Australia is over\n4,000 km away from that location on the\nmap if you draw a straight line from it.\nThis is tantamount to throwing people to\nthe ends of the earth. And\ncoincidentally, that place is incredibly\nrich in resources. Whether it's animal\nhusbandry or agriculture, the resources\nare incredibly abundant and the mineral\nresources are also quite considerable.\nHowever, this distance seems very far.\nSo, I wanted to ask about that steam\nengine you mentioned last time. Is it\npossible to do this? After pondering for\na moment, we woo gave his answer. That's\npossible, and it could shorten the time\nconsiderably by about 2 months, but\nthat's only if we arrange for their\niniement. I'm afraid we'll need a lot of\nlarge ships. After all, to gain a\nfoothold there, we need a lot of troops\nand supplies. Upon hearing this, Zhu\nYuan Jang waved his hand dismissively.\nNo rush. We still have more than 10\nyears to live. As long as we're alive,\nno one will dare to have any improper\nthoughts. Once you build the steam\nengine, we'll do as you say and send\ntroops to attack the Japanese pirates\nand take over the Silver Mountain. With\nmoney in hand, we can build a large\nnumber of ships, train a navy, conquer a\npiece of land in Australia, and then\narrange for them to be in theft. It must\nbe said that this is also a solution,\nallowing the entire Ming dynasty to\noperate at full capacity with ample\nfunds. Taking over a piece of land is\nmuch easier than conquering a vassal\nking. After all, the Ming army is not\nfully paid, and when fully paid, it is\ninvincible. As for the issue of\nsubsequent expansion that depends on the\nindividual abilities of the vassel\nkings. However, at that time there were\nonly indigenous people in Australia and\nit was extremely easy for Emperor Yoma\nto deal with them. At that time we can\nalso use local resources to exchange for\nsupplies with the Ming dynasty which\nwill be enough for sustainable\ndevelopment. However, what way we wanted\nmost right now was to start finding\nsomeone to research the steam engine\nimmediately. The sooner we can develop\nthis technology, the sooner we can build\nlarge ships, and then launch a massive\narmy to attack the Japanese pirates.\nAfter squeezing out all its value, we'll\ndestroy it all. And then we'll take Zhu\nXiongy&lt;unk&gt;s toy car, take the wheel\noff, and hand it to Lanu, telling him\nthat anyone taller than the wheel should\nnot be allowed to stay. In Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s\nview, even if these bastards live for\njust one more second, it would be a\nbetrayal of this world. Just as Weu was\nlost in thought, he heard Ju Yuan\nJang&lt;unk&gt;s sighing voice. I did have\nselfish motives in giving those sons\nthiefs, but I just wanted them to live\nwell. We didn't speak, but nodded to\nshow his understanding. And then Zhu\nYuan Jang continued, \"When Loi comes\nback, we&lt;unk&gt;ll talk to him about this.\"\nShiao Wu, I hope you'll be there, too.\nOkay, no problem. After discussing the\nmatter of settling overseas with Zhu\nYuan Jang, we wu said goodbye and left\nthe palace. Originally he wanted to go\ndirectly to the ministry of works to\nselect the right people but old Jew told\nhim to go home first. Conferring a noble\ntitle is a major event and the proper\nprocedures must be followed. Otherwise,\none will be looked down upon by other\nnobles. After we woo returned home, the\ndelegation that would bestow rewards\nwould immediately go to his residence\nand publicly read out the imperial edict\nto bestow the rewards. There was nothing\nWei Wu could do but go home first. And\nbesides, today was Zu Yusuan&lt;unk&gt;s\nbirthday. Meanwhile, in a tea house in\nthe capital city, Minister of Works\nXiao, Jun Jang, and Lie Shan Shan were\ndrinking tea in a private room. After\nthe tea master brewed the tea, Lysan\nShan waved his hand, and sent the person\naway. He then picked up the teacup,\ngently inhaled the aroma, took a small\nsip, and slowly said, \"Lord Xiao, his\nmajesty's great importance to this Royal\nAcademy of Science and Technology, so\nthe importance of this matter is beyond\ndoubt. As a subject, one should share\nhis majesty's burdens. We must provide\nthe Earl of Chong Lu with the best\ncraftsman to choose from. What do you\nsay?\" Xiao Jun nodded with a smile,\nindicating his agreement with Luchan\nChong. But in his heart, he was already\ncursing. Lee Shan Chong, you dog. You're\nnot human at all. You're dissatisfied\nwith Wei Woo. So why did you drag me\ninto this? Admittedly, Lie Shan Chong\ndid not show any problems in terms of\neither the content or tone of his\nspeech. Xiao Jun was well aware of the\nconflict between him and Wei Wu, so how\ncould he not guess what Lie Shan Chong\nmeant? He had already helped him during\nthe morning court session, and now Lie\nShan Chong wanted him to get involved\nagain. No wonder Xiao Jun was cursing\ninwardly. But cursing aside, the problem\nstill needed to be solved. After picking\nup his teacup and pondering for a\nmoment, Xiao Jun finally spoke. What the\nDuke of Han says is true. We, as his\nsubjects, must share his majesty's\nburdens in this matter. I will certainly\ndo my best to handle it well.\nOffendingly, Shan Chong was definitely\nout of the question, but Xiao Jun didn't\nwant to get too deeply involved in this\nmatter. Fortunately, he wasn't in his\nposition for nothing. He already had a\nsolution in mind. He entrusted Wei Woo\nwith selecting the most unsociable but\nhighly skilled workers from the Ministry\nof Works. As for whether he can make\nthese people obey, that depends on Wei\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s own abilities and has nothing\nto do with him. Upon hearing Ziao\nJun&lt;unk&gt;s reply, Lie Shan Chong nodded\nin satisfaction. After chatting for a\nfew more minutes, the two returned to\ntheir respective residences. Meanwhile,\nWeii Wu, who had just left the palace,\nhad already returned to his own\ndoorstep. Before he even entered the\ndoor, he saw his four maids standing\nanxiously at the entrance. Upon seeing\nhim return, the four maids, their eyes\nred and sobbing, ran towards him. But at\nthe crucial moment, Weii Wu pointed at\nthem and suddenly roared angrily, \"Stop,\nReeba. You put that damn chamber pod\ndown. Do you hear me? Put it down.\"\nChapter 76. Wayi Woo, I will save the\ndignity of Ming Men. It has to be said\nthat Dil Robba's actions are truly\nunpredictable. Weii Wu felt that even if\nhe had several CPUs installed in his\nhead, he still wouldn't be able to guess\nit. What kind of thought process is\nthis? How could she possibly come up\nwith the idea of standing at the front\ndoor holding a chamber pot? Moreover,\nyou can tell from Edge that this is the\nchamber pot he had ruined. Could this\ngirl be an invincible Aquarius? While\nWeii Wu was secretly speculating, Reeba\nfinally put the chamber pot aside. At\nthis moment, several maids finally came\nto him. \"Young master, are you all\nright?\" Reeba asked. Yuan was the first\nto speak, but she stopped halfway\nthrough her sentence. It's obvious that\nthey didn't want to say that unlucky\nword. The girl's eyes were bloodshot and\nher eyelids looked a little swollen.\nIt's likely that he cried a lot during\nseveral sessions. At this moment, Weii\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s feelings were somewhat\ncomplicated. He was unsure whether to be\nmoved or to feel a mixture of amusement\nand dismay. How could a grown man like\nhim calmly utter such a shameful thing\nas bleeding from hemorrhoids? All right,\nI'm Fine. Don't worry. After comforting\nthe young girls, Wayi Wu led them back\nto the mansion. Inside the room, Wayi Wu\nlooked helplessly at the few maids\nsitting on the sofa, but he could only\nstand aside, staring at the sofa that\nbelonged to him. I wonder if my ass can\ntake it. System. System, you've been\nsending me packages for a year now. Why\ndidn't they give me a hemorrhoid\nsuppository or even some Dragon Ball\nointment? Would be great. I'm suffering\nso much. Huh, that's right. I haven't\nopened the package yet. I was up all\nnight last night and this morning at\ncourt, I was pulled aside by old Jew and\nchatted for half a day. Only now did\nWayi Woo realize that the lucky draw for\ntoday hadn't been held yet. System, you\ncan choose the keyword yourself. Tiny\npill, treat hidden ailments, urgent\nneed, powerful effect, the kind that you\ninsert. I've hinted so obviously, you\nshouldn't disappoint your boss like last\ntime, right? With that thought in mind,\nWayi Woo switched his perspective to the\nsystem repository. Looking at the three\npackages floating in the air, Wayi Woo\nimmediately took a liking to the one in\nthe middle. With its rectangular flat\nappearance, it looks like a medicine\nbox. No matter how you look at it,\nalthough it is known that the appearance\nof the system package has nothing to do\nwith the items inside, but at this\nmoment, Wayi Woo decided to trust the\nsystems integrity. This once it's\ndecided on the middle one, open it for\nme. Then the screen flashed and another\ncontainer appeared in the system space.\nSeeing the other two in the corner, Weii\nWoos feelings were somewhat complicated.\nThe first box contained instant noodles.\nThe second contained weapons. And now\nanother one has arrived. They can't\nactually be hemorrhoid suppositories,\ncan they? You can't eat these things.\nAnd if they send so many, they'll burst,\nand we still won't be able to finish\nthem. While internally complaining, Weii\nWu turned to look at the young girls.\nYoung master is going to garden. You all\ngo and tell the servants that no one is\nallowed to go to the garden. Upon\nhearing this, the girls immediately ran\nout of the room and Wayi Wu also came to\nthe back garden. After looking around\nfor a while and making sure no one was\naround, he reached out and took out the\ncontainer. However, after opening the\nchest door, Weii Wu stood silently in\nplace. System, you're a genius.\nYou've completely mastered the use of\nkeywords, you son of a It was\nmedicine. Definitely medicine. And a\nwhole box full of medicine boxes, enough\nto fill an entire shipping container.\nEven after we woo open the container,\nmany items fell out because it was so\nfull. However, the name printed on a\nmedicine box has absolutely nothing to\ndo with hemorrhoid suppositories. It\nperfectly matches every keyword given by\nWayi Woo. The common name for this drug\nis Selenaphil, which netizens\naffectionately call the invincible blue\ntablet. Looking at the box full of\nlittle blue tablets. Wayi Wu didn't even\nthink about picking up the computer. The\nsame container can hold over 90,000\ninstant noodles. This thing must hold\nmillions of them. They'd eat it like\nit's their only meal, enough to last\nthem forever. Eating too much might even\ncause them to fart. Thinking of this,\nWayi Wu subconsciously glanced down and\nthen his temper flared up. System, what\ndo you mean? I'm a grown man full of\nvigor and vitality. Explain to me what\nyou mean by giving me this. Who the hell\nare you trying to look down on? While\ncursing under his breath, Wayi Woo\nraised his hand again and waved it,\nstoring the entire container into the\nsystem space. After the container\ndisappeared, he realized that he had\naccidentally spilled a box on the\nground. It's too much trouble to put it\nin my spatial storage, so I might as\nwell just put it in my pocket. Way\nmuttered something to himself and was\nabout to turn back into the house when\nhe saw his servant running in from\noutside the courtyard. Young master,\nyoung master, hurry, hurry out. Someone\nfrom the palace has come and wants you\nto go out and receive an imperial\ndecree. Receive the imperial decree. At\nfirst, Wayiu was a little confused, but\nhe quickly realized what was going on.\nIt should be the imperial edict from Zhu\nYuan Jang, the Zhu Emperor, bestowing\nrewards and titles upon a newly enobled\nruler. Notify everyone in the household\nto put down what they are doing and go\noutside the gate to respectfully receive\nthe imperial edict. Soon the servants\ngathered and followed Wayi Wu to the\ngate of the mansion. By this time, the\nprocession announcing the imperial\ndecree was already standing outside the\ngate, surrounded by onlookers. The unic\nwho came to deliver the imperial decree\nthis time was the same Unic Wong as\nbefore. Upon seeing Weii Wu emerge, Unic\nWong smiled and nodded at him before\nproducing the imperial edict. Weii Wu\nreceived the imperial decree. When Yun\nWong&lt;unk&gt;s loud voice rang out, all the\nservants behind Wei Wu knelt down. Even\nthe onlookers knelt down because of the\nimperial edict. Of everyone present,\nonly Weii Wu, the one who received the\nimperial edict and Ununic Wong, the one\nwho announced it, remained standing. The\nfaces of a kneeling people immediately\nchanged when they saw this scene. How\ncould this person do something so\ndisrespectful, simply standing and\nbowing when receiving an imperial edict?\nSome people were shocked, while others\nwith darker intentions chuckled\ninwardly, thinking they were in for a\ngood show. However, to everyone's\nsurprise, the Imperial Messenger did not\ntake any action. There was no anger, no\nshouting. It was as if Wei Wu was\nsupposed to stand there. Just as they\nwere wondering what was going on, Yun\nWang had already unfolded the imperial\nedict and read aloud. By the grace of\nheaven, the emperor decrees, \"I am\ngreatly gratified to receive the\nmiraculous provisions offered by Chow\nChow to save the world.\" After reading\nthrough the rather formulaic content,\nUniqang finally got to the important\npart. He is hereby granted the title of\nEarl of Chong Lu, and is bestowed with\n5,000 tales of gold, 30,000 tales of\nsilver, 60,000 strings of paper money,\n2,000 moo of fertile land, and a\nrestaurant on the banks of the Chinhai\nRiver.\nUpon hearing about the restaurants along\nthe Chinhai River, Weii Wu&lt;unk&gt;s eyes\nimmediately lit up. Yes, old Jew gifted\nme a restaurant and it's one of the 16\nfamous restaurants along the Chinuai\nRiver. I was wondering what to do with\nthose little blue tablets, but now I\nfound a market for them. Let's renovate\nMayan building and hang up some couplets\nand a plaque. First line, regain your\nformer glory. Second line, hold your\nhead high and be a person of integrity.\nLet's think about the horizontal scroll\nagain. Is there one that is both\nmeaningful and explicit? Chapter 77. Can\ndiapers also be used for networking?\nSince we're going to sell, we should\nsell to wealthy merchants, nobles,\nofficials, and gentry. We must choose\nthe best packaging and hire craftsmen\nfrom Jingga Jun to design and fire the\nporcelain bottles. Durability [snorts]\ndoesn't matter, but the appearance must\nbe high-end, classy, and impressive.\nSeveral beautiful women stand at the\nshop entrance year round, speaking\nfluent and soft woo dialect, exuding the\ncharm of Jang Nan. Regardless of whether\nthe customer sells anything or not,\ngreet everyone who enters with, \"Honored\nguest, please come in.\" How much would a\nsingle pill of such a miraculous drug\ncost to the wealthy? Selling for one\ntale of silver? Don't be ridiculous.\nThat's the cost price. You'd have to\nspend at least an ounce of gold to buy\njust one. And don't complain about the\nprice. It's not discounted. No, that's\ntoo cheap. One tale of gold is only\nworth four tales of silver. Such a fine\nitem would cost at least 10 tales of\nsilver. Those who are willing to spend\none or two tales of silver to buy\nmedicine don't care about spending\nanother nine tales. In any case, whether\nthey were nobles, wealthy merchants, or\ncivil officials and gentry, they were\nall people who were not short of money.\nbeing able to enjoy the ultimate thrill\nof combat. They would probably be\nwilling to spend their own money for it.\nWith millions of units in stock, I'm\ngoing to hog them all. We can't sell\nthem all. We simply can't sell them all.\nThe Earl of Chongla, the Earl of\nChongla, Weii Wu, who was engrossed in\nthe huge success of the Blue Movies,\nsuddenly heard Unic Wong&lt;unk&gt;s voice in\nhis ear. When he came to his senses, he\nrealized he was still receiving the\nImperial edict, and the Unic Wongs hand\nwas getting sore from holding it. Upon\nseeing this, we wu quickly reached out\nand took the imperial edict. Then a\nsmall perfume sample slid out from his\nsleeve. Upon seeing this perfume sample,\nUnic Wong's smile was absolutely\nradiant. He had only used it once\nbefore, but he completely fell in love\nwith its rich fragrance. Unfortunately,\nthere weren't many samples, so he didn't\ndare to use them easily and kept them as\na treasure. Now that way, Wu had sent\nhim another tube. He was overjoyed.\nFinally, he could use it a couple more\ntimes. This humble servant thanks your\nexcellency for the reward. After\nreceiving the sample from Weii Wu, Unic\nWong immediately bowed and paid his\nrespects. Weii Wu is now account. And\neven without any official position, his\nstatus is higher than that of this unic.\nDespite the reversal of roles, Weii\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s attitude remained as easygoing\nas ever. Unic Wang immediately accepted\nthis favor. This is not surprising as\nthe Unix during the Hong Wu era were not\nas powerful as those in later periods.\nTheir status was very low. Even if they\nhold the same official rank and grade,\nfew officials will treat them as human\nbeings. Respect is something that seems\nespecially precious when you don't have\nit. After carefully storing the perfume\nsample, Unic Wong bowed to Wei Wu again\nand prepared to return to the palace to\nreport. However, just as he turned\naround, he suddenly remembered something\nand turned back. Lord Chong Lo, may I\nspeak with you in private, Wayiu was\nabout to return to his residence when he\nheard Yun Wong&lt;unk&gt;s words and\nimmediately turn around. Of course,\nplease come in, Yun Wuang, led by Wei\nWu, the two then entered through the\ngate and arrived near Shiao Chong in the\ncourtyard. After dismissing everyone\nelse, Unwong spoke in a low voice. Lord\nChong Lo, on my way to deliver the\nimperial decree, I happened to see Du\nHan and Lord Xiao coming out of the tea\nhouse together. I heard some rumors in\nthe palace before saying that there\nseemed to be some unpleasantness between\nthe Earl of Changangel and the Duke of\nHan. Now that the Earl of Changel is in\ncharge of overseeing the Royal Academy\nof Science and Technology, he must need\nto contact Lord Xiao about many things.\nAfter saying this much, Unic Wong fell\nsilent. However, he didn't need to say\nanything more. Weii Wu already\nunderstood. The Lord Xiao mentioned by\nYun Wong is without a doubt Xiao Jun.\nThe minister works. After the court\nsession, instead of returning to their\nrespective offices or going home, the\ntwo men went to a tea house to drink\ntea. Even a fool could guess that at\nleast Shan Chong was up to some terrible\nplan again. Thinking of this, Wei Wu\nfrowned slightly. Damn it. This old\nbastard can't do anything to me. He just\nkeeps doing disgusting little things\nbehind my back. No way. I can't swallow\nthis insult. I have to get my revenge.\nJust as wayu was thinking about how to\nretaliate. Unic Wong suddenly spoke up.\nLord Chan Lu, I happen to have a\nrelative who is a craftsman in the\nministry works. Why don't I help you\ninquire about him? Upon hearing Yun\nWong&lt;unk&gt;s words, Wu immediately came to\nhis senses. After a moment of\ncontemplation, a bright smile appeared\non his face. In that case, I'll have to\ntrouble Unic Wong to help me out. Oh, by\nthe way, I have some things here that\nyou might find useful. After saying\nthis, Wayi Wu went directly into a room\nin the front yard and came out again\nwith a bundle in his hand. Unic Wong, I\nknow that Unix has some inconveniences\nand troubles. This thing of mine should\nbe able to help a little. I have written\nthe instructions on paper and put them\nin. Also, I have included a tip in the\nbundle. Yun Wong took the bundle from\nWei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s hands and then spoke. If\nthere is any news, I will have it\ndelivered to you immediately. After\nspeaking, Unong bowed slightly, then\nturned and left. Upon returning to the\npalace gate, Unwong opened the bundle\nand took a look at it because he had to\nundergo an inspection. The first thing\nthat catches the eye is a large gold\ningot weighing 50 tails, so shiny that\nit's hard to look away. Next was a strip\nof paper and a bunch of small white\npieces that looked like cotton. The note\nreads, \"Simply wear it close to your\nskin. No need for padding. It absorbs\ninstantly and has absolutely no leakage.\nTo be honest, Uni Wong really didn't\nknow what this thing was, nor did he\nunderstand what instant absorption with\nno leakage meant. However, one can tell\nfrom the appearance and Wayi Wu also\npointed out that there is no need to put\ncotton cloth on top. You can probably\nguess that this thing is something like\na small garment. As long as it's worn\nclose to the skin, there's no need to\nworry about urinary incontinence caused\nby any physical defects. To be honest,\nif someone else had given him this gift,\nUnic would have felt somewhat insulted.\nBut the person who gave it to him was\nWei Woo, and he believed that Wei Woo\nwas truly helping him solve his\ntroubles. After carefully storing the\ngold ingots, he went through the\ninspection inside the palace gates and\nthen returned to report to Zhu Yuan\nJang. After finishing all his tasks,\nUnwong immediately returned to his room.\nAfter replacing the damp cotton cloth, I\nimmediately took out that small white\npiece that looked like cotton. After a\nlittle research, I understood it and\nthen quickly put it on. In an instant,\nit felt as if all my worries had been\ntaken away, leaving only that\nbreathable, dry feeling around me.\nHaving experienced the benefits of this\nthing, Unic Wong treated it like a\nprecious treasure and carefully hid it\naway. It's like he's afraid someone will\nsee him and then try to take it from\nhim. At the same time, he once again\nremembered Weii Wu&lt;unk&gt;s kindness. Weii\nWu probably never imagined that adult\ndiapers could become a good thing for\nmaintaining personal connections. As the\nold saying goes, even a pair of\nunderwear and a piece of toilet paper\nhave their uses. Just as Yun Wong was\ndelighted with the diapers, Wu was\nhaving a headache. How should we\ncelebrate Zhu Yuswan&lt;unk&gt;s birthday?\nChapter 78. Zhu Yusu&lt;unk&gt;s birthday. A\nlate night question about her fate.\nNightfalls. Several young girls were\ngathered in the courtyard of Wei\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s main house. Even Bridget Lynn,\nwho was seriously injured and unable to\nget out of bed, was carried to the\ncourtyard. Zhu Yushwan was surrounded by\nthree other girls and their eyes were\nalso covered. Unable to break free,\nZhuwan had no choice but to ask, \"Leah,\nDoraba, Goler, what are you doing? Why\nare you blindfolding me?\" Upon hearing\nZhu Yusuan&lt;unk&gt;s words, the three girls\nimmediately burst into laughter. Oh,\nSister Yusuan, don't ask anymore. I'll\nlet you go in a bit anyway. Yes. Yes.\nDon't worry. We're not young masters. We\nwon't eat you. After Leah and Naza\nfinished speaking, Dabba, who was\nstanding next to them, also wanted to\nsay something. However, before she could\nspeak, Leah cut her off. Doraba, you\ncan't keep your mouth shut. Don't say\nanything. Do you hear me? Upon hearing\nLeah's words, Draaba immediately pouted\nher agrieved lips. However, she also\nknew that she was in the wrong. After\nall, she was the one who caused chaos in\nthe whole house this morning. Surrounded\nby the three girls, Juwan had no choice\nbut to let them cover her up. Meanwhile,\nin the room, Wei Wu is looking at the\nswan cake in front of him with a\ntroubled expression. It's worth\nmentioning that this swan cake is indeed\nexquisitely crafted, just like a work of\nart. The exquisite goose head and\nelegant long neck are all made of white\nchocolate. The white chocolate feathers\non its body are also exquisitely\ncrafted, each one lifelike. However, it\nwas precisely because the cake was so\nexquisite that way Woo was reluctant to\ndamage its appearance. Since we've\nalready made a birthday cake, we\ndefinitely need to light candles and\nmake a wish. The problem is he really\ncouldn't find a suitable place to put\nthe candles on this exquisite 16-in\nswan. The goose's head and neck are\ndefinitely not suitable. They're made of\nwhite chocolate, and they might break if\nyou put a candle in them. The feathers\non the body are also unsuitable. After\nhesitating for a long time, Wayi Wu\nfinally fixed his gaze on the swan's\nrump. It should be fine to insert two at\nan angle here, right? The wax dripping\ndown won't get on the cake. Without\nhesitation, Wayi Wu took out two candles\nand carefully inserted them into the\ngoose's rear end. Although it looks a\nlittle strange, it has a unique and\nunconventional beauty. This is Wei Wu's\nown evaluation of the work. Having\nresolved the candle issue, Wei Wu\nimmediately got up and turned off all\nthe lights in the room. The girls\noutside were immediately excited when\nthey saw this scene. The hand covering\nZhu Yuwan's eyes tightened even more as\nif he was afraid she would see\nsomething. Then the door to the room\nopened and a ray of light slowly emerged\nfrom the room. Only then did the girls\nfinally let go of his hands, staring\nblankly at the swan and wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s\nhands. Although they didn't know why\ncandles were stuck on the swan's\nbottoms, it didn't stop them from being\nshocked. Not to mention Shing Xia and\nthe others. Even Princess Zuyuan had\nnever seen such exquisite pastries.\nHappy birthday to you. Happy birthday to\nyou. As the cake drew closer, Wei Wu,\nwho was holding it, began to sing\nsoftly. Finally, Wei Wu stopped in front\nof Zu Yuwan, placed the cake down, and\nturned to look at her. Little girl, you\ndidn't even tell the young master it was\nyour birthday. If it weren't for Naza,\nNaza, take your hand back. It's not time\nto eat yet. Weii Wu was speaking when he\nsuddenly saw Naza sneakily reaching for\nthe cake. Seeing that her wicked hand\nwas about to touch the goose's head, Wu\nquickly spoke up to stop her. Then he\nglared at her again before looking at\nZhu Yuwan once more. I was just trying\nto lighten the mood with a few words,\nbut Naza ruined it all. But thinking\nabout it, I don't know what mushy things\nto say, so I might as well just go for\nit. Yusin, close your eyes, put your\nhands together, make a wish in your\nheart, and then blow out the candles.\nYour wish may come true. Zhu Yusuan\nslowly closed her eyes and made a wish\nin her heart as we Wu had instructed. As\nshe made her wish, a tear slowly slid\ndown Zhu Yusuan's cheek. Is it strange?\nActually, it's not strange at all. Zhu\nYushuan lived in the palace from a young\nage, and his mother died shortly after\nhis birth. Although she was taken in and\ncared for by Empress Ma, she was not her\nbiological mother and could not be with\nher all the time, there was little human\nwarmth in the palace. And Zuyuan had\nbasically never experienced the feeling\nof being cared for by others. The time\nXiuan spent at Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s house was\narguably the happiest period of her\nlife. Today marks the pinnacle of this\njoyful time, a moment I will never\nforget. Fortunately, there was little\nlight around, only the candles on the\ncake, so no one noticed anything unusual\nabout her. After making her wish, Zhu\nYuwan opened her eyes and blew out the\ncandle. He then turned his head directly\nto look at Wayi Wu. Young master, thank\nyou. All right, all right. I hate mushy\nstuff the most. Let's eat cake first.\nNaza's drooling is so bad. Wipe your\ndrool off. After finally getting through\nto Naza, Wayi Wu picked up a plastic saw\nand handed it to Zhuan. Today is your\nbirthday, so you have to make the first\ncut. I'll teach you. As they spoke, Wayi\nWu took Zhu Yusu&lt;unk&gt;s hand and guided\nher to cut the cake. As the cake, which\nresembled a work of art, was cut open,\nZhu Yuswan actually felt quite reluctant\nto part with it. However, this feeling\nwas quickly replaced by shyness. With\nChow Chow's help, the 16-in swan was\ndismembered beyond recognition. The\nsweet aroma of white chocolate and cream\ninstantly filled the entire yard. Seeing\nthat Naza was about to burst out\nlaughing, Wayi Wu quickly handed her the\nfirst piece of cake. Naza immediately\nput in her mouth as soon as she received\nit. The smooth and soft texture, the\nsweet cream, and the silky white\nchocolate. The rich flavors exploded in\nNaza's mouth in an instant. So delicious\nthat she almost cried. Young master,\nthis is so delicious. Wow. Seeing her\nlike this, we woo smiled and shook his\nhead. However, the taste of sweet cream\nand white chocolate can be a major\nobstacle to a young woman's weight loss\njourney in modern times. It's not\nsurprising that people in ancient times\nwho had never eaten it before would have\nsuch a reaction. Just as the group was\nsmiling at Naz's face covered in cream,\nXiushuan suddenly spoke up. \"Young\nmaster, this cake is so big, it would be\na waste if we couldn't finish it. Can I\nshare with others? Today is your\nbirthday. This is your cake, and you can\ndecide how to divide it.\" Seeing that\nway, Wu agreed, Zhu Yuwan immediately\nsummoned the other servants and gave\neach of them a piece. Amidst laughter\nand chatter, the cake was quickly\ndevoured and time slipped away\nunnoticed. After the servants left, only\nWayi Wu and Zhu Yusuan remained in the\ncourtyard. The two sat on the steps in\nfront of the door, silently gazing at\nthe moon in the sky. After a long\nsilence, Zhu Yuwan suddenly looked at\nWei Wu. Young master, you are from 600\nyears in the future. I have something I\nwould like to ask you. H what do you\nwant to ask? When I was serving the\nempress in the palace, a princess was\nvery kind to me. I want to know her\nfuture fate. Chapter 79. Lee Shan Shong.\nYour damn retribution is coming. Way\ndidn't think too much about Zhu Xu\nYushwan's question. A maid, especially a\nyoung maid of Zhu Yuan's age. In the\npalace, it's considered lucky if you're\nnot bullied. And it's incredibly\nfortunate if you're taken care of. Not\nto mention that the person taking care\nof Zhuwan is a princess. So, it's no\nwonder that this girl cares about her so\nmuch. However, since Zu Yushuan wanted\nto know, Wayiu wouldn't hide it from\nher. Okay, which princess do you want to\nask about? Uh, wait a minute. Just tell\nme which princess she is. There are few\nrecords about the princess in later\ngenerations. Most of them don't even\nknow her name, only her title. In fact,\nChow Chow was quite helpless, as there\nwere indeed not many records about the\nprincesses of the Zhu family. Moreover,\nseveral of them did not have a good\nending. They either became widows, were\nexiled, or died young. Only five\nprincesses have their names accurately\nrecorded, and all of them only have\ntitles. Wayi Wu knew about the title,\nbut the problem was that in the early\nMing dynasty, it was stipulated that\nprincesses could only receive titles\nafter marriage. Therefore, he could only\nhave Zhu Yusuan use the princess's\nranking as her position. After listening\nto Wayi Wu&lt;unk&gt;s words, Zhu Yuwan\npondered for a while and then came up\nwith a little scheme. I don't know the\nprincess's age or birth order. Why don't\nyou tell me, young master? Upon hearing\nthis, Wayi Wu was taken aback and\ncouldn't help but ask a question. Aren't\nyou serving in Cunning Palace? Even if\nyou don't know the birth order, you\nshould at least know the names. Young\nMaster, didn't you say you didn't know\nmost of their names? Even if I told you\ntheir names, you still wouldn't know\nthem. Oh, that's true. I only know a few\nnames. Old Man Zu has more than a dozen\ndaughters. Weii Wu nodded and then began\nto speak. The eldest princess was\nPrincess Linen Zhu Jing Jing who was\nlater implicated in the Hui Yong case\nand exiled to Jangpu where she died at\nthe age of 62. The second princess was\nPrincess Ningua Zhu She became\na widow but she enjoyed wealth and honor\nand died at the age of 70. Then there's\nthe third princess. Upon hearing the\nname of the third princess, Zhuwan's\npretty face immediately showed a strange\nexpression. However, Wayi Wu was\nspeaking and did not notice the unusual\nexpression on Zhuwan's face. The birth\nand death years of the third princess\nare unknown and her name is also\nunknown. All that is known is that she\nwas betrothed by his majesty in the 17th\nyear of the Hong Wu reign. She was given\nthe title of Princess Chonging and\nmarried an ordinary man named Neo Chong.\nLater, Neo Chong was exiled to Ginchuan\nYunan for committing a crime. Princess\nChonging was not required to go, but\nbecause of her kind nature, she was\nwilling to follow Neoing into exile\nafter marrying him. So, his majesty had\nno choice but to agree. As a result,\nPrincess Chonging died halfway there.\nBut the cause of death remained a\nmystery. In the end, his majesty was so\nangry that he ordered Nyo Chong to be\nexecuted. At this point, Wayi Wu\ncouldn't help but slowly shake his head\nand sigh softly. Alas, in fact, Princess\nChonging could have enjoyed a life of\nluxury, but she was still willing to\nshare joys and sorrows with her husband.\nIt must be said that such a woman is\nrare even in this era, and even more so\nin later generations. As for the fourth\nprincess, just as Wei Wu was about to\ncontinue speaking, Zhu Yu Schwan, who\nhad been silent all along, suddenly\ninterjected, \"Young master, you just\nsaid that if I make a wish and blow out\nthe candles, my wish might come true. Is\nthat true?\" Weii Wu turned to look at\nZuyu Schwan, hesitated for a moment, and\nthen answered, \"Actually, I don't know\neither, but people should always have\naspirations for a better life and strive\ntowards happiness, right?\" Zuyushuan\nlooked into Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s eyes, smiled\nsweetly, and then continued to ask,\n\"Young master, are you happy living 600\nyears from now?\" Upon hearing this, we\nwu&lt;unk&gt;s expression stiffened, \"Why does\nthis girl always have to bring up the\nmost sensitive topics? How can I be\nhappy as a beast of burden? This is like\ntearing open a person's wound and then\nsprinkling salt, cumin, and chili powder\non it.\" After a moment of silence, Wu\nfinally answered the question. Happiness\nis relative. Compared to ordinary people\nin this era, my life back then was\nhappy. As long as you're willing to work\nand earn money, at least you won't have\nto worry about food and drink. And you\nwon't go hungry, but you may not have\nmuch savings. Zhu Yushuan watched Wayi\nWoo from the side, hesitated for a\nmoment, and finally couldn't help but\nask a question. Young master, do you\nwant to go back? Upon hearing this, for\nsome reason, images from the past\nflashed through Wayi Wu&lt;unk&gt;s mind.\nHowever, it seemed to him that it was\njust a memory, something to reminisce\nabout, but not to cherish. Even though\nthat world was richer in resources and\nmore convenient, he had no desire to go\nback at all. Looking up at the silvery\nwhite moon hanging in the sky, Wayi Woos\nlips curved into a smile. If you don't\nwant to, when you feel longing, look up\nat the moon because it is always there\nin the sky. There's a saying in our\narea, \"No matter how far apart we are or\nhow many years have passed, we always\nsee the same moon.\" Zhuwan raised her\nhead and stared blankly at the moon,\nmimicking Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s expression.\n\"That's such a beautiful sentence.\"\n\"Young master, do you think you'll be\nhappy staying in the Ming dynasty?\" He\neveryone's happiness is different and\nthe happiness I want is actually very\nsimple. Upon hearing this, Zhuwan\nimmediately turned to look at Wei Wu,\nasking him with anticipation, \"What is\nit? A wife, kids, and a warm bed. I'll\nlead the Ming dynasty to conquer the\nworld.\" Zhuan didn't quite understand\nthe last sentence, but she did\nunderstand the first one. No one knows\nwhat was going on in this little girl's\nhead, but under the moonlight, a blush\nslowly appeared on her pretty face.\nNeither of them spoke after that, and\nthey just sat quietly on the steps in\nthe moonlight. Zu Yushuan sat next to\nWei Wu, hesitating whether or not she\nshould reveal her true identity to him.\nShe had never thought about this before,\nbut now she began to worry that her\ndeception would disgust Wu. After\nstruggling and hesitating for a long\ntime, Zhuwan finally mustered up a bit\nof courage and prepared to confess to\nWei Wu. Shall we? Zhu Yushuan had just\nuttered two words when Weii Wu suddenly\nsat up. By the way, Yushuan, isn't it\npast midnight now? Zhu Yuwan, who had\nbarely mustered the courage, immediately\nlost heart after being interrupted by\nWei Wu. Yes. Yes, young master. What's\nwrong? It's&lt;unk&gt; nothing. Don't say\nanything yet. I have something urgent to\nattend to. After he finished speaking,\nWayi Wu&lt;unk&gt;s eyes flashed and\nimmediately switched to the perspective\nof the systems warehouse. System, I'm\nnot giving you keywords this time. I\nwant to see what you'll use to fool me.\nOr maybe the one in the middle. As Wayi\nWu silently recited the mantra, a scene\nflashed before his eyes and a large\nsquare cardboard box appeared. At first,\nWayiu was curious about what good things\nmight be inside something that was\nbigger than a washing machine. until he\nsaw the logo printed on a cardboard box.\nDJI Fly Cart 30. DJI Fly Cart 30 carrier\ndrone. After figuring out what it was,\nWayi Woo jumped up from the steps. Haha,\nsystem. I absolutely love you. I was\nthinking about how to get revenge this\nafternoon. And here you are. Every cause\nhas its effect. Lean Chong, your damn\nretribution is me. Chapter 80. The Trump\ncard. Canned food that stinks and emits\nblack smoke. If it's a regular drone,\nthen at most it could just fly up and\nlook at the sky and the scenery. The\nactual effect may be that the toy\ncomponents outweigh its other functions.\nBut this Fly Cart 30 is different. Wayu\nonce desperately wanted to own one. To\nbe honest, this kind of drone with\nheavyduty carrying capacity isn't very\nuseful for ordinary people, but this\nthing is so powerful and it looks really\ncool. It's just too expensive costing\nover 100,000 yu unit. The official\nspecifications state that the dual\nbattery configuration can carry a load\nof 30 kg with a full load range of 16 km\nand a maximum flight altitude of 6,000\nm. However, it is well known that DJI\nhas always liked to exaggerate its\npayload capacity. Even if the payload is\n40 kg, they only exaggerate it to 30 kg.\nIn fact, Wayu had seen test videos\nonline which tested the load capacity of\na single battery. A 50 kg cement bag can\nfly back and forth several times over a\ndistance of 300 m. This is why when we\nsaw this thing, he immediately thought\nof using it to cause trouble for Leon\nShan. My trump car, which I've been\nsaving for so long, is finally going to\nbe put to use. While muttering to\nhimself, Wayi Wu's gaze immediately\nlocked onto a corner of the systems\nwarehouse. There was a box covered with\nall sorts of clutter, even though it had\nno visual effect whatsoever. But in Wei\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s eyes, this thing looked like it\nwas emitting a thick, oily black mist.\nThe debris on it seemed to be some kind\nof seal. Now the time has finally come\nfor this seal to be broken. Yusuan go\nand fed Jean Hai and the others. Zhuan\nlooked at Wei Wu with a blank\nexpression, not understanding why he\nsuddenly became so alarmed. However,\nupon hearing Weii Wu&lt;unk&gt;s words, he\nimmediately snapped out of his days, got\nup and quickly ran towards the front\nyard. After Zhu Yuwan left, Wayi Wu took\na deep breath and quickly walked to the\ncourtyard gate. I only took the box out\nafter confirming that it was far enough\naway from my room and that the\nsurrounding area was well ventilated.\nThe cardboard box is printed with red\nand yellow stripes and a line of text is\nprinted in the very center of the box.\nCerting. Those who eat it regularly will\nknow that this line means pickled\nherring. That's right. This box contains\nwhat's known as the world's smelliest\nfood, canned herring. When Wei Woo first\nobtained this thing, he cursed the\nsystem for 2 days and two nights before\nhe calmed down. This awful thing is\ncompletely inedible. It not only smells\nterrible, but also tastes extremely\nsalty. It's not something a human should\neat. Just looking at him, Wayi Wu\ncouldn't help but frown and then quickly\nreturn to the middle of the courtyard.\nTake out the large box containing the\nfly cart 30 drone, unpack it, and\nassemble it according to the\ninstructions. After about half a cup of\ntea time, Jean Hai and the other 11\nhurriedly ran into the courtyard. While\ntidying their clothes, some of them ran\nup to Wei Woo, their eyes still somewhat\ndazed. They had obviously just gone to\nsleep. The rest of the more\nnormall-looking people were the night\nwatchmen. Upon arriving beside Weii Wu,\nJean Hai immediately began to ask\nquestions. Young master, we apologized\nfor being late. It's all right. I just\ncalled you over temporarily. Please\nstand over there and hold the light for\nme. To save electricity, we didn't take\nout a flashlight, but instead had Jean\nHai and the others hold the lamps.\nFortunately, with 11 people in a circle,\nthe lights were bright enough for Weey\nWoo to assemble the drone. Main frame,\ntwo batteries, cargo box, cargo box\nframe, propellers, and air suspension\nsystem. After taking these items out one\nby one, it didn't take long to assemble\nthem. It's actually a very simple\nassembly process, except that the cargo\nbox frame and propellers are a little\nmore complicated. After installing the\nbattery, press the power button and a\nbeep will sound after about two or 3\nseconds. Beep beep beep. Protect the\nyoung master. At first, Jean Hai and the\nothers were curious about what their\nyoung master was doing as the thing\nlooked strange. Suddenly, they heard the\ndrone start up, which startled them so\nmuch that they dropped the lights they\nwere holding. With a loud shout from\nJean Hai, all the remaining men drew\ntheir knives. A group of people solemnly\nand carefully protected Wei Woo in the\nmiddle. Everyone, including Jean Hai,\nlooked at the drone with a sense of\nimpending doom, as if they were about to\nattack at any moment. Of everyone\npresent, only Zhu Yuan remained calm,\nhaving long been accustomed to Wei\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s extraordinary abilities. Seeing\nhow nervous the guard around him were,\nWayi Wu also became a little anxious.\nThis thing is a real treasure. If they\nwere to cut it open and damage the\npropeller, there would be nowhere to fix\nit. Don't panic. Everyone, don't make a\nmove. This is my precious treasure.\nEveryone, disperse. Disperse. Upon\nhearing Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s order, Jean Hai and\nthe others breathed a sigh of relief and\nslowly dispersed. Seeing everyone leave,\nWayi Wu breathed a sigh of relief and\ntook out the remote control to start\ndebugging and docking. Soon under Wayi\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s careful control, the drone was\nready. Looking at this handsome big guy\nin front of him, we was already quite\nimpatient. Ladies and gentlemen, the\nmoment to witness a miracle has arrived.\nAs soon as we Wu finished speaking,\nXiushuan and Jean Hai were still\nwondering what miracle they were\nwitnessing. The next second, they saw\nthat strange dark thing begin to rotate\nat its four corners. What followed was a\nscene that left them speechless. Without\nwind or any human intervention, this\nthing actually took off and flew away on\nits own. Moreover, the takeoff speed was\nextremely fast, as if it were being\nlifted by an invisible rope. My god,\nwhat what is this? Why can this thing\nfly by itself? A wooden magpie? It's a\nwooden magpie. Legend has it that Gong\nShu once made a wooden magpie that could\nfly in the sky for three days and three\nnights. Really, young master? Are you\nperhaps a descendant of Gong Shu Ban and\nhave even recreated the lost art of the\nwooden magpie? Wow, look. This magpie\ncan change direction at will. It's back.\nIt's back again. Amidst the gasps and\nshouts of surprise from the crowd, Wayi\nWu maneuvered the drone to land on the\nspot. Actually, he was just testing it\nout first to avoid any mistakes in the\nsubsequent operations. After all, this\nwas a treasure he used to surprise Lie\nShan Chong, so he needed to practice\nusing it first. That old guy had\nrepeatedly harassed him behind his back,\nand Wayu couldn't let it go without\nretaliating. Now that we have this\ntreasure, the roles of offense and\ndefense have completely changed. After\ntesting the drones, Wayi Wu took out the\nbatteries and charged them with a power\nbank. According to the instruction\nmanual, it takes about 40 minutes to\nfully charge at 220V maximum power.\nSince there's still plenty of time, we\nshould fully charge the battery first to\nensure nothing goes wrong. After turning\non the power, Wayiu took out several\nlarge plastic bags from behind him and\nhanded them to Jean Hai. Then he pointed\nto the box of herring cans at the gate\nof the courtyard. Jean Hai, there are\nmore than 100 tin cans in that box. You\nand the brothers open them and pour them\ninto these bags. Fill it up. Then we Wu\nimmediately turned to look at Juyusan.\nLet's stand a little further away. That\nstuff has a strong smell and a long\nafter effect. Don't get overwhelmed by\nthe odor. After saying that, he\nimmediately pulled Zhu Yusuan back to\nthe door of the room. Chapter 81. Lean\nChong. Have you ever heard of the\nherring that fell from the sky? Seeing\nJean Hai and his group heading towards\nthe canned herring, Wei Wu felt a sense\nof anticipation. To be honest, he really\ndidn't have any particularly good\nsolution for that old guy. Luchan Chong.\nKilling him is definitely out of the\nquestion. Old Je still needs Luchan\nChong. He's still useful no matter what.\nHe was a pillar of the Ming dynasty and\nthe leader of the Huha River civil\nofficial group. Moreover, they left no\nevidence of their actions, only engaging\nin some underhanded tactics. Others rely\non skill and technique while he just\nshows up with a machine gun and starts\nshooting. It just doesn't feel right.\nWith such advanced technology at our\ndisposal, how can we act like a brute?\nWhat about our class? As I always say,\nif you're going to play, play a game\nwhere you have a technological advantage\nand can easily dominate newbies. Lean\nChan was secretly trying to annoy\npeople. So Wayi Wu openly tried to annoy\nhim. Fly over your house every night and\ndeliver some canned herring that falls\nfrom the sky. Hey, aren't you angry? I\nwant that kind of happiness where I\nsleep with you. You know, I slept with\nyou, but there's no proof that it was\nme. You suffer a loss, but have to\nremain silent and swallow your\nbitterness. It's important to understand\nthat drones are extremely difficult to\ndeal with, even on modern battlefields.\nEven later generations had a headache\ndealing with it, let alone the Ming\nDynasty, which had absolutely no way to\ndeal with it. In other words, crossbows\ncould pose some threat to it. But the\nproblem is that these are prohibited\nweapons. Even military generals and\nnobles might not have such a thing, let\nalone a civil official like Leon Chong.\nThe thought of Lishan Chong&lt;unk&gt;s\ncondition in the next few days filled\nWei Wu with immense joy. But at that\nmoment, Jean Hai's voice filled with\npain came from the courtyard gate. Young\nmaster, oh my god, what the hell is\nthis? Why does it smell so foul and\ndisgusting? I'm about to throw up. Upon\nhearing Jean Hai's voice, Wayi Wu looked\nup and immediately burst into a\nlaughter. 11 guards, each wearing 11\nLandre's torture masks. The scene was\nsimply beautiful. This stuff is called\ncanned herring. If you had to define it,\nyou could barely call it food. No way,\nyoung master. You call this food? Who\nwould eat something that stinks worse\nthan Upon hearing this, Wayi Wu\nlaughed even more heartily while also\nfeeling relieved that he didn't have to\ndo this himself. However, seeing the\npained expressions on Jeanghai's and the\nothers faces, he still offered a word of\ncomfort. Just think of it as stinky\ntofu. Some people like to eat it anyway.\nStinky tofu. Upon hearing this word,\nJean Hai asked in confusion, then asked\nagain, \"This thing smells bad but tastes\ngood.\" Seeing that, Jean Hai looked\neager to try, Wu casually offered an\nexplanation. \"No, it smells bad and it\ntastes even worse. You could try it if\nyou're interested. Upon hearing Weii\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s words, Jean Hai looked down at\nthe white liquid and sticky fish meat\ninside the can. After hesitating for a\nwhile, he ultimately couldn't take that\nstep and silently continued opening cans\nand bagging the food. However, at this\nmoment, Wayi Wu suddenly remembered\nsomething, so he quickly asked about it.\nBy the way, do you guys know anything\nabout something called a spicy\ncaterpillar? Yanglatsi? What's that? As\nJean Hai and the others packed the bags,\nthey slowly shook their heads. Seeing\nthis, Weii Wu described it again. It's\none of those green bugs covered in sharp\nspiky things that will hurt and cause\nredness and swelling if you get on your\nskin. I know this. This thing is called\na hairy weasel. There are many trees\noutside the city that have these things.\nTo be honest, Wayeu was also certain\nwhether Mao Xi was Yong Lazi. However,\nhe has already described the\ncharacteristics of a citrus tree, so is\nunlikely to be much different from the\ndescription. Thinking of this, Wayi Wu\nturned a look at Zu Yushwan. Yusuan,\ntomorrow have all the servants in the\nhouse go out and spread the word that\nthe young master paid money to buy this\nthing. Two coins for one hairy pig. Take\nas many as you want. Zhu Yushuan\nwondered why Weii Wu wanted to keep\nthis, but she didn't ask any further\nquestions and nodded to indicate that\nshe understood. After giving Zhu Yusuan\nhis instructions, Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s face\nshowed a playful smile. I'll send you\nsome herring tonight so you can have a\ntaste and tomorrow night I'll send you\nsome spicy peppers to satisfy your\ncravings. Lon Chong, young master, I\nlove you so much. As Weii Wu was\nsilently muttering to himself, he\nsuddenly smelled a foul stench wafting\ninto his nostrils, \"Damn, I can't escape\nthis smell, even from this far away.\nIt's killing me.\" After muttering a\ncurse, Wayi Wu turned to look at Zu\nYuan, who was covering her nose. Elbow,\ncome inside with me. Without waiting for\nZuyuan to speak, he pulled her directly\ninto the house. Only when Jean Hai's\nvoice came from outside the door saying\nthat it was all set up. Did the two of\nthem cover their noses and come out.\nWhat time is it now? It must be almost\ndawn by now. The fifth watch is between\n3 and 5 a.m. and Lee Shan Chong should\nhave already gotten up by now, barring\nany unforeseen circumstances. In the\nearly Ming dynasty, the morning court\nsession was held at dawn, but officials\nwould arrive about an hour earlier to\nwait. It's almost time. By the way, has\nJean Ha returned? They're back. They\nshould be keeping watch outside now.\nHave someone send someone to the\nvicinity of Lee Shan Sean's residence.\nRemember, they should carry a lantern,\nstand there for a while, and then leave.\nUpon receiving Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s order, Jean\nHai immediately ran out. Under Wei\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s command, the remaining men hung\nthe three bags of herring cans securely\non the hooks. This bag contains about 30\ncans and weighs about 10 kg, which is a\npiece of cake for a drone. The case of\ncanned herring was mostly opened with\nabout 30 cans remaining. After\neverything was ready, we woo controlled\nthe drone to quickly climb to a position\nof about 50 m. Through the transmitted\nfootage from the built-in camera, a\nperson carrying a lantern quickly\ndisappeared into the distance. With the\nspeed of a drone, it easily caught up.\nNot long after, the Imperial Guard\nstopped for a while near a large mansion\nand then left. Interestingly, Lie Shan\nChong's residence was located in the\nsame place as Wei Woos, not far from the\nImperial Palace. The two residences were\nnot particularly far apart with a\nstraight line distance of about 6 or 700\nm. After the Imperial guards left, Weii\nWu controlled the drone to continue\nclimbing. It wasn't until it was about\n100 meters away that it switched to\nhover mode, taking in the entire layout\nof the Lee residence. This house is\nsimilar to Wei Woo's own, both having\nfive courtyards and a garden. The drone\nhovered over the mansion, constantly\nmonitoring the situation below. It was\nalmost dawn, and the lights and candles\nin Lysan Chong's residence were already\nlit. Leon Chong, who had already gotten\nup, dressed in his court robes with the\nhelp of his concubines, and then walked\nout of the room without looking back.\nThe feeling wasn't like sleeping with\nyour own woman. It was more like you'd\njust been to a brothel. As Lon Chong\nemerged from the room, he stood on the\nsteps at the doorway and casually dusted\noff non-existent dust from his body. But\nat that moment, he suddenly heard a\nstrange sound coming from above. It was\na rustling sound like the sound of a\nstrong wind blowing through paper. Just\nas he was about to look up, he saw three\nwhite objects fall from the sky and\nexplode right in front of him. Bang.\nBang. Bang. Three heavy objects fell to\nthe ground with a thud, followed by a\ndesparing stench that filled the air.\nChapter 82. The Korean public was\nutterly disgraced in every sense of the\nword. The sudden turn of events nearly\nmade Lee Shan Chong kick the bucket on\nthe spot. Fortunately, he had seen his\nshare of big events and managed to calm\nhis wildly beating heart. But what\nfollowed was an extremely foul stench\nthat he had never heard of in his life\nand would remember in his next life as\nwell. Most importantly, the three things\nthat just exploded were too close to\nLeon Shan. The splashed juice completely\ncovered him. In addition to the\ndisgusting juices, there were also\ncountless bits of minced meat clinging\nto his body. The most coincident thing\nis that right in the center of a Shan\nChong's forehead, there was a whole fish\npasted on it. He instinctively reached\nout and grabbed it, but accidentally\ncrushed it. The texture was like mud,\nand the stench was everywhere. As if it\nhad locked onto a target, it kept\npouring into his nasal cavity. Without\nthe slightest hesitation, Lee Shan Chong\ndisplayed a completely instinctive\nreaction. Unfortunately, he had just\ngotten up and hadn't eaten anything. All\nhe vomited was yellow bile. Master,\nmaster, what's wrong? I am vomiting.\nMaster, someone come quick. The master\nis vomiting. When Lee Shan Chong saw the\nperson approaching, he immediately\nraised a finger and pointed to the top\nof his head. So bad. So bad I could\nvomit. Upon seeing this, the guards\nimmediately brought a ladder and climbed\nonto the roof, but found nothing.\nBecause the commotion in the courtyard\nwas so loud, the servants in the house\nimmediately noticed that something was\nwrong. Before long, a large group of\nservants gathered outside the courtyard.\nOnly a few of these people were\nqualified to enter the courtyard. The\nothers had to wait outside. However, as\nsoon as those people entered, they\nsmelled the strong stench in the\ncourtyard and vomited as well. The\nservants outside the courtyard were all\nignorant and low-class people. Upon\nseeing this, they assumed the courtyard\nhad been poisoned and hurriedly sent\nsomeone to find a doctor. However, after\nthe doctor's diagnosis, no symptoms were\nidentified, and the person was then sent\naway by the steward of the manor. Lysan\nChong immediately ordered people to\nfetch water in preparation for washing\naway the stench from his body. As for\nthe result, it goes without saying. Even\nmodern shower gels can't clean this\nstuff. let alone ancient soaps. Leon\nChong soaked in the bathtub several\ntimes, changing the water two or three\ntimes, but he still couldn't get rid of\nthe smell. Ultimately, having no other\nchoice, he could only send his household\nsteward to the signin area outside the\npalace to report his illness. However,\nWu was unaware of all this. He was\ncurrently lying in bed, soundly asleep.\nAs the herring bomb landed, he\nimmediately controlled the drone to fly\nback in order to avoid being detected.\nHe didn't wake up until he got dressed\nand went out to hand over the craftsman\nto the Ministry of Works. I only heard\nsome rumors about last night on the way,\nbut the content was a bit far-fetched.\nHave you heard? The Duke of Han has been\npoisoned and he's seriously poisoned.\nHe's got diarrhea all over his pants.\nThat's not right. I heard it, too. They\nsaid that the Duke of Han was poisoned\nat dawn and then went mad, vomiting\nfeces all over the courtyard. Huh. What\nI heard was that the Duke of Han\noffended the god of excrement and the\ngod used magic to make excrement fall\nfrom the sky as punishment for him.\nYou're all wrong. I know best. The Duke\nof Han offended the gods and was\npunished. From now on, he can only\nrelieve himself with his mouth. Along\nthe way, Wayiu heard too many bizarre\nversions of the story. One of the most\nbizarre versions is that a South Korean\nman contracted a brain disease and\ncooked feces at home in the middle of\nthe night. If we woo himself the\nmastermind behind it all, he might have\nbeen misled by these rumors. However,\none thing is certain. The Duke's mansion\nis tainted in every sense of a word. To\nbe honest, after hearing these rumors,\nwe woo was at a loss for words, both\namused and exasperated. No wonder the\nancients said that rumors can become\ntruths with just three people. They can\nbe distorted as they are passed around.\nJust then, a new rumor reached Wayi Woos\nears. What you've said is nothing. Let\nme tell you, this morning after court,\nhis majesty personally visited the\nDuke's residence. And guess what? His\nmajesty didn't even get into the\ncourtyard. The stench inside forced him\nto return to the palace. Now, even if\nyou're several feet away from the Duke's\nmansion, you can smell the stench\nemanating from inside upon hearing that\neven old Jew had been forced to retreat.\nWeii Wu&lt;unk&gt;s smile widened even\nfurther. This old man is a rough fellow.\nIf even he can't stand it, then that's\nenough to show how terrible the\nenvironment in Leon Chong's home is. But\nthat's normal. The broth from canned\nherring doesn't dissipate its flavor\neven after it's dried in the sun. The\nentire Inion Prefecture is now dominated\nby two pieces of news. One is that the\nDuke of Han has been disgraced and the\nother is that the Earl of Changangle is\nbuying up large quantities of hairy\nbeasts. Listening to the everinccreasing\nnumber of new versions of the Duke's\nmansion, Weii Wu felt incredibly\nrefreshed. However, just as he was about\nto continue his journey to the Ministry\nof Works, Jean Hai suddenly approached\nand whispered, \"Young Master, someone\nsays he wants to see you. He says he is\na relative of Uniang.\nWayi Wu paused, then immediately asked,\n\"Where is he? That guy's been acting\nsuspiciously. He's in the alley over\nthere, young master. Shall we go?\" \"Go\nahead. Don't worry. Everything will be\nfine.\" Weii Wu casually replied, then\nled Jean Hai into a nearby alley. \"This\nalley is like two different worlds. It's\nbustling outside, but deserted inside.\"\nJust as Wei Wu was wondering, a\nmiddle-aged man wearing a linen shirt\ncame out from the corner. This humble\nman, Seong, pays his respects to the\nEarl of Chong Lu. Seong. Upon hearing\nSeong's self-introduction, Wei Wu was\ntaken aback. The name seemed rather\nunlucky. Why did his father give him\nsuch an unlucky name? Could it be that\nhe had some strange and high hopes for\nhim? Weii Wu thought to himself, but his\nface didn't show anything unusual. He\nsimply asked a question. Are you related\nto Unic Wang? Gold absorbed instantly.\nAbsolutely nothing. Okay, okay, I got\nit. Just tell me what information you\nfound out. Upon hearing the words absorb\ninstantly. Weii Wu quickly interrupted\nhim. Seong then shared what he knew. It\nturned out that after Xiao Jun returned\nto the government office yesterday\nafternoon, he immediately selected a\ngroup of craftsmen. Conventionally, one\nshould choose skilled craftsmen, but\nthis time they chose all unremarkable\npeople. No, it's not that they're\ninconspicuous, but rather those who are\nunpopular and have always been\nostracized and marginalized. These\npeople basically don't work on weekdays\nand have no extra income, so they can\nonly live on their meager salaries.\nSeong happened to be one of those\nselected. After listening to Se\nJong&lt;unk&gt;s description, Weii Wu pondered\nfor a moment before slowly asking,\n\"Songh, I'd like to know how skilled you\nselected are.\" Upon hearing this, a\nconfident look immediately lit up in\nSeongs eyes. Reporting to Lord Chong Lu,\nI dare say that no one in the entire\nMinistry of Works is better at carpentry\nthan me. They're simply blind to its\nvalue. After listening to Seongs,\nWayi Wu roughly understood why these\npeople have been ostracized. It's not\nthat their skills are lacking, but\nrather that their skills are too good.\nThey're arrogant about their abilities,\nbut don't know how to socialize. They\nonly know how to bury themselves in\ntheir work, but they don't realize that\nin official having ability is not\nenough. One must also know how to\nflatter. However, this is exactly the\nkind of talent that Wei Wu wanted. As\nfor their arrogance, we woo could only\nchuckle. If they could just grab any\nflashlight, we would immediately give\nthem several cans of herring. Chapter\n83. You brat. You've really messed with\nLee Shan Chong to death. Since Lee Shan\nChong and Xiao Jun were so\naccommodating, Wayi Wu had no choice but\nto accept it generously. He wants as\nmany talents as there are. If we can put\nan end to their arrogance, these people\nwill become the best skilled workers. To\nbe honest at this moment, Wayi Wu even\nwanted to bring some cigarettes and\nalcohol to Lie Shan Chong&lt;unk&gt;s door to\nexpress his gratitude. He gives me\nwhatever I want. How can this old man be\nso considerate? To ensure there were no\nmistakes, we wu asked Sea another\nquestion. Are the other selected people\nalso highly skilled? Of course, but when\nit comes to carpentry, no one is better\nthan me. Upon hearing that arrogant\ntone, Wayi Wu knew he had guessed\ncorrectly. Okay, you can go back first.\nI'll go to the Ministry of Works to hand\nover the work in a bit. Keep an eye on\nthings when I'm selecting people. Apart\nfrom those of you who were selected, I\nwant all the other skilled craftsmen. At\nthis moment, Wayi Wu seemed to be\npossessed by leopard head, exuding\ndoineering aura. After Seang left, we wu\nled his men to continue toward the\nMinistry of Works. However, he gave the\nimpression of strolling around rather\nthan rushing to do errands. After about\nan incense sticks time, we woo and his\nentourage finally arrived at the gate of\nthe government office. Halt! This is the\nMinistry of Works. Unauthorized\npersonnel are not permitted to enter. As\nsoon as they approached the gate, before\nwe woo could even step inside. Two\nguards at the entrance stopped them. At\nthis point, it would naturally be Wei Wu\nwho spoke up. Given his status, he\nwasn't without his own people. After\nbeing reprimanded by the guards, Jean\nHai and the others immediately stepped\nforward. How dare you? This is the Earl\nof Chong Lu sent by his majesty for the\nhandover. How dare you obstruct him?\nAnnounce his arrival immediately. Upon\nhearing that way, Wu was a nobleman and\nhad come by imperial decree. The two\nguards expressions immediately changed.\nThey were merely lowranking officials.\nHow could they dare offend nobles? He\nimmediately bowed to Wei Wu, then\nquickly ran into the government office,\nand a moment later, a laugh could be\nheard. Huh? Why didn't the Earl of Chong\nL send someone to deliver a message\nbeforehand so that I could have made\npreparations? As the sound came, Xiao\nJun, the minister of works, also came\nout of government office. Logically\nspeaking, Wayi Wu was only account while\nXiao Jun was a highranking official of\nthe second rank. So, there was no need\nfor him to personally greet him. But who\ncan blame him when this person is Weii\nWoo. Moreover, Xiao Jun&lt;unk&gt;s ability to\nclimb the ranks to the second rank in\nthe official is no exaggeration. He was\na shrewd and capable person. Although\nWei Wu did not hold an official\nposition, one can glean some insight\nfrom Zhu Yuan Jan&lt;unk&gt;s attitude towards\nhim. They are a favorite of his majesty\nthe emperor, being polite to them won't\nhurt. Seeing their own minister's\nattitude, the two guards were so\nfrightened that their legs went weak.\nFortunately, Wayi Wu wasn't like those\nhigh-ranking officials who liked to\nflaunt their power, so he didn't cause\ntrouble for two lowly henchmen. Once\ninside the Ministry of Works, Wayi Wu\ndid not want to waste any time. After\nXiao Jun summoned the selected\ncraftsman, he proposed to select some\nmore people. Zhu Yuan Jang had said he\nwould fully cooperate. So, Ziao Jun had\nno choice but to give Wei Wu the list of\ncraftsmen. After that, with Sean&lt;unk&gt;s\ncooperation, about eight more craftsmen\nwere selected. There were a total of 24\npeople which can be said have brought\ntogether all the elites of the Ministry\nof Works. He took away one of the\ncarpenter, brick layer, blacksmith and\nother craftsmen as well as one craftsman\nwho specialized in developing firearms.\nZiao Jun tried his best to persuade Weii\nWu, his words clearly conveying a\nrefusal, but Wei Wu remained unmoved. In\nthe end, Xiao Jun&lt;unk&gt;s face turned as\nblack as charcoal, and he didn't even\nsee Weii Woo off from the official\nresidence. However, the Royal Academy of\nSciences is not yet completed. So, these\npeople have only made a reservation and\nhave not taken the project with them. As\nfor why Chow Chow insisted on having\nartisans develop firearms, the reason is\nquite simple. In this day and age, the\nonly firearms the Ming dynasty possessed\nthat could be considered decent were the\nlarge iron cannons. Individual firearms\nat that time only included hand cannons\nand breach loading cannons. Three barrel\ncannons and arabus only appear during\nthe judging period. The arquabus, also\nknown as the matchlock gun, was\nconsidered too outdated by Chow Chow. He\nplanned to skip the transitional models\nand make the flint lock musket the\nfoundational weapon. If industrial\nconditions [clears throat] hadn't been\nso restrictive, he would have loved to\nstart his research directly from the\npercussion cap gun. Note that this\nrefers to research, not manufacturing.\nChow Chow himself did not know how to\nmake guns. But he knew the key\ninformation about flint lock musketss.\nChina has never lacked smart people.\nWhat it lacked was direction and\ninspiration. After leaving the\ngovernment office, we woo along with\nJean Hai and the others had just\nreturned to their doorstep. As a result,\nI found that the front door of my house\nwas blocked by a huge crowd, making it\nimpossible to move, and quite a sight.\nAfter sending people to inquire, they\nlearned that these people were\nexchanging hairy beasts for money.\nThanks to Jean Hai and his guards who\npushed through the crowd, Earl Wei Wu\nwas able to return home. The\nenthusiastic crowd did not disperse\nuntil curfew was almost approaching.\nWhen Weii Woo asked the manager, he was\nsurprised to find that they had spent\nfive tales of silver just to collect the\nhairy beasts. At two coins each, they\ncollected 2,500 hairy beast that day.\nJust thinking about the image of them\npiled up together made Weey Woo feel\nterrible, and he got goosebumps all\nover. But then he thought, since it\nwasn't him who was disgusted by this\nthing, the goosebumps disappeared\ninstantly. That evening, the drone took\noff in the courtyard again and hovered\nover Lee Shan Chong's house. The\ncourtyard was contaminated last night,\nand it's clear that no one will live\nthere anymore. This time, Wayi Wu flew\nthe drone directly to about 5 m above\nthe roof of the main house in the five\ncourtyards. Then, using a sling, the\nnearly 10 lb bag of insects was gently\nplaced on a roof. We was too lazy to\neven look at what would happen to Lee\nShan Chong's house. After returning from\noperating the drone, I went straight to\nmy room to sleep. However, to everyone's\nsurprise, while he was sound asleep in\nthe middle of the night, a servant told\nhim that a unic had come looking for\nhim. Wayi Wu sighed inwardly. I was\nplanning to deliver the inflatable doll\nto Lowi tomorrow. Now I can't play with\nit anymore. While thinking this, Wayi Wu\ngot up and followed the servants to the\nhall. Unexpectedly, it was an old\nacquaintance who came. Unic Wong, who\nhad delivered the imperial edict to him\ntwice, just as Wei Wu had predicted.\nWhen Unic Wong saw him, he showed a look\nof bewilderment as if you were both\nlaughing and crying. Lord Chonglu, the\nonly person who could send a message to\nhis majesty so late at night is probably\nyou, sir. After saying this, Unong\ncleared his throat before speaking. His\nmajesty said, \"You brat, stop playing\naround. If you keep playing like this,\nyou'll kill Lie Shan Shan. Enough is\nenough. Upon hearing Old Ju's words,\nWayi Wu immediately burst into laughter.\nAll right, Unic Wong, please also pass\non a message to his majesty, saying that\nXiao Wu knows that as long as he doesn't\nprovoke me, I won't mess with him. Upon\nhearing wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s reply, Unicong\nsecretly clicked his tongue in\namazement. In this mighty Ming dynasty\nfrom top to bottom, perhaps only the\nruler before us could speak to the\nemperor like this. Very well. Then I\nwill return to the palace to report\nback. After Yun Wong left that night,\nold Ju probably said something. Luchian\nChong knew perfectly well that Yong\nGlatsi was related to Chow Chow, but he\nneither approached her nor made any\nunderhanded moves. Weii Wu then\nthoroughly enjoyed a period of leisure.\nHe spends his days unpacking packages\nand playing with his maid. He lives a\nvery happy life. Until that day, news\ncame from the Royal Academy of Sciences\nthat the project was completed. Weii Wu\nwas in a good mood and prepared to take\nout the delicious food he had just\nacquired to celebrate a little. As a\nresult, old Jew brought his wife, two\nsons, and grandson, his whole family,\nand came running after smelling the\naroma. Chapter 844th. Brother, we're\nplanning to let you establish a country.\nWhat do you think, you brat? Instead of\nsharing the good food with us and your\naunt, you hide away and eat it secretly,\nhuh? Weii Wu was staring at a large\nbronze pot, enjoying the rich aroma\nemanating from it. Suddenly, he heard\nOld Yu&lt;unk&gt;s voice and quickly turned\naround to look behind him. Only then did\nthey realize that there were five people\nbehind them, four adults and one child.\nThey are Zu Yuan Jang, Empress Ma, Crown\nPrince Zu Bao, Imperial grandson Zhu\nXianging, a young man I've never met\nbefore. No, what kind of personality\ndoes old Jew have? Why does he come over\nevery time I eat? As we Wu thought to\nhimself, his subconscious thought was to\nput the whole pot away. Actually, it's\nnot surprising that he reacted this way.\nIt wasn't that way Wu was unwilling to\nshare with others. Judging from past\nexperience, whenever Lao Zu came, he\nnever had a full meal. To be honest, it\nwas only because there was a stranger\npresent that this situation was\nresolved. Otherwise, the pot might have\nreally been taken away. Seeing Zhu Yuan\nJang, who was sniffing the air with a\nbroad smile. Weii Wu&lt;unk&gt;s eyes lit up\nand he immediately said, \"Uncle Zu, you\nand your wife are so loving. You're so\nbusy, yet you still made a special trip\nto bring your wife here.\" As he spoke,\nWayi Wu stepped forward and approached\nEmpressma Ma. Andy, let me tell you, I\ncooked something really good today. You\nhave to eat a lot. After saying this,\nWayi Wu deliberately turned to look at\nZu Yuan Jang. Well, Uncle Zu, you're\nbusy, so don't worry about Auntie\nBrotherhu and Shoming with me. Upon\nhearing this, Zhu Yuan Jang was\nimmediately displeased, pointing his\nfinger at Wei Wu with a fierce\nexpression. You brat. We finally managed\nto find some time to come here and\nyou're already trying to kick us out\nbefore we've even had a bite to eat. You\njust trying to kick us out? You wait.\nYou're finished. You'll see if we don't\nbeat you up today. After saying this,\nZhu Yuan Jang placed his hand on his\nwaist as if preparing to draw his jade\nbelt. Hey, Uncle Zu. I didn't tell my\naunt about you stealing half of my roast\nduck last time. You brat. Why don't you\njust tell me now? After saying this, Zhu\nYuan Jang drew his jade belt and chased\nafter Wei Wu, running wildly throughout\nthe courtyard. However, the two of them\nwere quite self-aware. No matter how\nthey ran, they wouldn't get close to the\ncopper pot that was boiling. Watching\nthe two, one big and one small, fooling\naround, Empress Ma laughed so hard her\nface was beaming. Since Zhu Xiang Ing\ncontracted smallox, she had never\nsmiled, so it was rare for her to smile\nso happily today. After the playful\ncommotion, Wei Wu dismissed all the\nmaids in his courtyard. Only Zhu Yusuan\nremained, and then she led old Zu and\nhis family to the table. The rich aroma\nfilled the air around the table, causing\neveryone's mouths to water\nuncontrollably. After everyone was\nseated, we was about to ask Zu Yuan to\nsit down as well, but Empress Ma spoke\nfirst. Yusen, sit down and eat with me.\nThank you, your majesty. Upon hearing\nEmpress Ma's words, Zhu Yuan immediately\nsat down next to her. At this moment,\nZhu Bao, who had been silent all along,\nsuddenly spoke up. Xiao Wu, this is my\nfourth brother, Zhu. Upon hearing Zhu\nBao&lt;unk&gt;s introduction, Wei Wu turned to\nlook at Jud. That makes sense. Zu Yuan\nJang had said before that he sent\nsomeone to summon Zu Di back. Weii Wu\nwas surprised that Zhu would actually\nbring him directly to his home. Just\nlike we Wu imagined the Yona Emperor,\nZhu D did indeed look very imposing. He\nhad thick, long eyebrows, a robust\nbuild, and bright deep set eyes. His\nappearance gives him a heroic and\nextraordinary look, but his youth makes\nhim lack a strong sense of authority. As\nWeu looked him over, he also raised his\nhands in a gesture of greeting. So it's\nhis highness Prince Yen. I am Wei Wu,\nthe Earl of Changangle. I greet your\nhighness. Hello, Uncle Changangle. Upon\nhearing Weii Wu greet him, Zudi\nimmediately returned to greeting though\nhe felt a little strange. Why are the\npeople greeting me all old men, aunties,\nolder brothers, or nephews? When it\ncomes to myself, it becomes my identity.\nAren't I my father's son? Although he\nfelt something was a miss, Zhu D did not\nshow it outwardly. After all, he had\nseen everything that had just happened.\nHe himself wouldn't dare to talk or joke\nlike that with his own father. Yet, we\nwu could be so unrestrained. Looking at\nhis own father, he seemed completely\nunconcerned, even appearing to be\nenjoying himself. Based on this alone,\nhe had to evaluate Wu and treat him as\nan equal. Moreover, Zhu Yuan Jang had\ntold him beforehand that he was being\nintroduced to an extraordinary person.\nIn truth, Wayi Wu did not intentionally\ntreat people differently. He wasn't\nfamiliar with Zhu D, so there was no\nneed to be overly enthusiastic during\ntheir first meeting. When Zhu Bao first\ncame, Wayu also addressed him as the\ncrown prince. However, Zhu Bao handled\nit so well that he identified himself as\nBrotherh Zu before he could even finish\nspeaking. After exchanging greetings,\nWayi Wu stopped chatting with Judy and\nturned his gaze to the bronze pot on the\ntable. What's cooking in this pot is a\ndelicacy he's been craving for a long\ntime. Phone G's seafood hot pot dish\nsounds unremarkable. But this dish has\nanother name that everyone knows. Buddha\njumps over the wall. A famous fuen dish.\nAlthough it's pre-made food delivered\nfrom a courier, this stuff isn't cheap.\nA box of 12 jinseng and 12 abalone costs\n1,288\nyuan. Weii will only open three boxes.\nNo one knows which sucker bought them,\nbut he got a good deal now. Xiao Wu,\nwhat are you cooking in this pot? This\naroma is unlike anything I've ever\nsmelled in my life. Just as Wayi Wu was\nwondering if it was ready, he heard Zhu\nYu and Jang&lt;unk&gt;s voice again. Of\ncourse, you've never smelled it. This\ndish was only created during the\nGuangshu era, hundreds of years after\nyou ascended to heaven. Wayi Wu chuckled\ninwardly before answering. This dish is\ncalled Fu Shou Kuan, also known as\nShwand Bhutang, and is so popular that\neven Buddha would abandon his meditation\nand jump over the wall to try it. It\nuses chicken, duck, lamb shank, pig\ntrotters, ribs, pigeon eggs, etc.\nsimmered over low heat for at least 4\nhours to make the soup base. After the\nsoup is cooked, add abalone, see\ncucumber, fish lips, yakkin, glue,\ntendons, cuttlefish, scallops, and other\ningredients, and continue to simmer. As\nhe spoke, Wayi Wu reached out and lifted\nthe lid of the copper pot. At this\nmoment, Wei Wu seemed to be possessed by\nthe spirit of Little Master Chef, and a\nstrong golden light could be seen\nflashing from the mouth of the pot. But\nto Zhu Yuan Jang and his men, all they\nsaw was thick, hot steam rising into the\nair. At the same time, the rich aroma of\nmeat, a combination of dozens of\ningredients, immediately burst forth on\nthe table. It tanalyzes the taste buds\nand makes the stomach churn, making one\nyear to savor it immediately. The sounds\nof swallowing saliva coming from the\ntable reached Wei Wu's ears without any\nattempt to conceal them. Zhu Yuan Jang\nand Zu Bao had already picked up their\nchopsticks, ready to start eating. But\nat this crucial moment, Wayi Wu picked\nup a small bowl and a soup spoon and\nslowly spoke. Annie, you've been taking\ncare of Shionging these past few days,\nand you haven't been eating or sleeping\nwell, so you've lost a lot of weight.\nThis Buddha jumps over the wall soup has\na warming and nourishing effect. You\nmust eat this first bowl. Upon hearing\nWeii Wu&lt;unk&gt;s words, Zhu Yuan Jang and\nZu Bao froze in midair with her\nchopsticks. The thick golden yellow\nbroth, rich in aroma, slowly drips from\nthe wooden ladle into the bowl. Weii Wu\nstirred it, and the already rich aroma\nof meat became even stronger. Old Ju was\nalready eagerly waiting, but Weii Wu was\nslowly serving it little by little.\nAfter finally filling the small bowl to\nthe brim and placing it in front of\nEmpress Ma, Zhu Yuan Jang immediately\ndipped his chopsticks into the copper\npot. Zhu Bao, who was standing to the\nside, was not much slower. Only Xiang\nIng and Zhu Di one was still young and\nthe other had not yet let go. In the\nend, old even had someone bring him\nsteam buns so he could dip them in the\nlast bit of broth from the pot and eat\nthem. That's only possible because of\nEmperor Xu Yuan Jang. Any other emperor\nprobably wouldn't have done that. After\nthoroughly finishing the entire pot of\nBuddha jumps over the wall, old Zu\npatted his stomach and began to get down\nto business. Interestingly, when Zu Yuan\nJang spoke, he wasn't looking away. Wu,\nbut at his fourth son, Zhu, fourth\nbrother. We're planning to let you\nestablish a country. What do you think?\nChapter 85. If I can't build a steam\nengine, I'll never get married in my\nlife. Zhu D was still savoring the\nlingering fragrance on his pallet,\nrecalling the taste he had just eaten.\nHearing his father ask this question\nsuddenly, he was completely dumbfounded.\nNo, I just ate and haven't digested yet.\nWhat does dad mean by this? Are you\nplanning to make me disappear? After\nbeing lost in thought for a while, Zhu\nsuddenly came to his senses and looked\nat Zu Yuan Jean. Father, I swear to\nheaven that I have never had any\nimproper thoughts. After saying that,\nZui immediately turned to look at Juba.\nBrother, you know me. If I had those\nkind of thoughts, I Zui stopped halfway\nthrough his sentence, raised his head,\nand looked sincerely into Zuao&lt;unk&gt;s\neyes. As Wei Wu watched from the side, a\nfamiliar image suddenly popped into his\nmind. \"Brother, you know me. If I had\nthose kinds of thoughts, I would have\nmade you lie face down on the table.\"\nWeii Wu in a mischievous mood added the\nsecond half of the sentence for Zhu.\nThinking of that movie that's applying\nfor UNESCO World Heritage status. A\nsmile unconsciously crept onto my lips.\nUnexpectedly, Zhu Yuan Jang happened to\nsee his smile. Although Zhu Yuan Jang\ndidn't say anything, he was even more\ncertain in his heart to send Ju\noverseas. On the other side, Zhu Bao\nlooked at Jud and shook his head\nhelplessly, then reached out and patted\nhim on the shoulder. Fourth prince, you\nneed to change your impetuous nature.\nWhy don't you think carefully about what\nFather Emperor just said? There's one\nmore thing I want you to remember to\nkeep it firmly in mind. I have never\ndoubted the bond between us brothers. Do\nyou understand? After Zu Bao finished\nspeaking, Zhu D was stunned. He first\nrealized what was going on, but then he\nwas a little confused. What? What dad\njust said was about him establishing a\ncountry, not about him taking power.\nFilled with doubt, Zhu D turned to look\nat Zhu Yuan Jang. Father, you just said\nyou wanted me to establish a country.\nYour son is foolish and doesn't\nunderstand what you mean. Not long ago,\nwe got a map from Shiao Wu. This map\nshows the entire landscape of this land\nand overseas. After Zhu Yuan Jang\nfinished speaking, Zudi's expression\nbecame even more puzzled. Does such a\nthing exist in this world? Or is it just\na legend like the classic of mountains\nand seas? Upon hearing Zhu Yuan\nJan&lt;unk&gt;s words, Zhu D couldn't help but\nhave some doubts about Wei Wu. It's not\nthat I doubt Wei Wu is a fraud, but\nrather that I question the authenticity\nof that so-called map. Just as Zhu D\nremained silent, Zhu Yuan Jang spoke up\nagain. Shia Wu told us that you have the\nqualities of an emperor and that you\nwould be a wise ruler. So we want to\ngive you a chance to be a ruler. After\nthe founding of the nation, we\ndisregarded the opposition of the\nofficials and reestablished the feudal\nsystem, hoping that you sons could live\nwell. Now that we know there are vast\nterritories overseas that are even\nlarger than the Ming dynasty, it\nwouldn't be unreasonable to give you a\nchance to establish your own country and\nbecome emperors. With each word Zhu Yuan\nJang spoke, Zhu&lt;unk&gt;s eyes widened a\nlittle more. When Zu Yuan Jang told them\nthey would have the opportunity to\nestablish a country and become emperors.\nZui's mouth dropped open in\nastonishment. It felt like the sky had\nfallen and I couldn't come to my senses\nfor a long time. But in reality, Zudi\nwasn't truly terrified. Rather, he felt\ntrapped and in a difficult position.\nWould he be willing to establish a\ncountry and become emperor? Of course,\nI'm willing. And it's a strong desire\nfrom the bottom of my heart, for my very\nsoul. Zu believed that his talents were\nsecond to none, even to his elder\nbrother. But he knew very well that the\nposition belonged to his elder brother,\nZhu Bao, and no one else could sit\nthere. Even if someone really wanted to\nsit in that position, they would have to\nask Zu D for permission first. But at\nthe same time, Zhu D was also worried\nthat his father was testing his\nthoughts. Once you show even the\nslightest hint of interest, your fate\nbecomes unpredictable. If it's just a\nbeating, that's fine. kind of like what\nhappened when my second brother came\nback a few days ago. He was sent to the\nImperial Medical Academy the night he\nwas beaten by his father and he still\ncan't get out of bed. But if he treats\nhimself like a traitor and guards\nagainst it with all his might, then he\ncan forget about ever touching military\npower again in his lifetime. For him,\nwho had always longed to fight on the\nbattlefield, this was undoubtedly a\nnightmare ending. The complex and\nconflicted emotions in his heart\ncontinued to spread. And for a moment,\nZhu D felt as if a mountain was pressing\ndown on him. Just when he was feeling\noverwhelmed and barely able to breathe,\nZu Bao said something. Instantly, all\nthe pressure vanished. Fourth brother,\nthe idea of establishing FFTs overseas\nwas proposed by father and me. I hope\nyou won't hold a grudge about it.\nOverseas is a long and arduous journey.\nOnce I leave the Ming dynasty, it will\nbe very difficult to return. I may not\nbe able to see my mother even once every\n10 years or so. But the eldest brother\njust doesn't want you to become useless\nin your fftoms. You've seen what\nhappened to the second son after he was\nin theft. I raised you all from\nchildhood. I hope you will achieve great\nthings and expand the territory of our\ngreat Ming dynasty. Pretty. As Zhu Bao\nspoke, Wayiu secretly admired him. As\nexpected of the most stable crown prince\nin history, Zhu Bao&lt;unk&gt;s words\ncompletely put Zhu D in his grasp.\nIndeed, Xiu and Jangs sons were mostly\nraised by Zhu Bao's side from a young\nage. Although he is the eldest brother\nin terms of status, setting aside\nethical relationships, his younger\nbrothers should all call him little dad.\nFirst, play the card of brotherhood and\nthe hope that the younger brother will\nsucceed. Then add the card of\nrighteousness for the country. Zhu D was\nstill too young, only 22 years old, and\nwas immediately moved by Zhu Bao's\nbrotherly affection. Big brother, I'll\ndo whatever you tell me to do. Seeing\nthat Zhu Bao had dealt with Zhu D, Zhu\nYuan Jang chuckled inwardly, then turned\nto look at Wayi Wu. Xiao Wu, I've come\nto see you today, mainly for two things.\nFirst, how long will it take to build\nthe steam engine? Uncle Zu, the research\ninstitute has only just been completed\nand hasn't even started research yet.\nYou can't expect me to make a solemn\npledge. We have already ordered the Navy\nto intensify its training in preparation\nfor the future. Before Zhu Yuan Jang\ncould finish speaking, Wayi Wu stood up\nabruptly, patted his chest, and said,\n\"Give me a month, and if I can't build a\nsteam engine, may I never find a wife\nfor the rest of my life.\" Seeing Weii\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s reaction, Zhu Yuan Jang\nsecretly smiled to himself. You little\nrascal, you think we can't handle you?\nHe Zhu Bao understood why Weii Wu was\nacting this way, but only Zhu D was\nbaffled. He hesitated for a moment,\nlooked at his father, and then at his\nolder brother. In the end, he still\nasked Zhu Bao in a low voice, \"Big\nbrother, what is this driving chicken?\nAnd what is that science and technology\nresearch institute?\" I don't know\neither, but Father Emperor Ataché's\ngreat importance to it, and Shiau also\nsaid that this thing is very important.\nZhua shook his head and gave a casual\nreply. Zhua wasn't lying about that.\nLately, either his son was sick or his\nwife was causing trouble. Besides\ndealing with the issues following\nEmpress Lou's death, a great deal of\ntime also had to be spent on state\naffairs. They were so busy that they had\nno time to pay attention to what Wei Wu\nand Zhu Yuan Jang had said. I finally\nmanaged to find some time today and then\nI suddenly heard this. I'm already\nthinking of going back and having a chat\nwith Lo. Just as the two were talking in\nhush tones, Zhu Yuan Jang spoke up\nagain. The second thing I want to ask\nyou is whether that place called\nAustralia is barren and what its mineral\nresources are like. When the fourth\nbrother goes there, will he be able to\nsettle down and be self-sufficient?\nChapter 86. What? You want me an\nilliterate person to train the crown\nprince? Wayi Wu then realized that this\nwas the purpose of Zhu D's arrival.\nAfter briefly recalling the situation in\nAustralia, he then began to speak.\nAustralia is a very resourcerich\nlocation with a flat terrain and natural\ngrasslands. More than 60% of the land is\nused to support agriculture and animal\nhusbandry. The land is fertile and\nsuitable for growing grains. Moreover,\nit is surrounded by the sea and has\nabundant fisheries. And most\nimportantly, the land is vast, not much\nsmaller than that of the Ming dynasty,\nand now only some native people live\nthere. Upon hearing that the land was as\nvast as the Ming dynasty. Zhu was\nimmediately filled with longing.\nAlthough this is overseas, once it is\noccupied, it is equivalent to creating\nanother Ming dynasty. In fact, not only\nwas Zu dissatisfied, but Zu Yuan J was\nalso very satisfied. Such a good place\nshould of course be left, my son. How\ncan we allow those uneducated barbarians\nto occupy such a prosperous land? After\ninquiring about the situation in\nAustralia, Zhu Yuan Jang immediately\nspoke again. The third thing is, I heard\nthat you transferred a craftsman from\nthe Ministry of Works to research\nfirearms. Is it because you want to\nmanufacture firearms? We did not hide\nanything and immediately spoke. That's\nright. Our Ming Dynasty's firearms are\ntoo outdated now. Hand cannons and\nmusketss are not only weak, but also\ninaccurate. I plan to develop a more\nadvanced firearm that is not only more\npowerful and has a longer range, but\nalso does not require carrying a fire\nsource. Before flint lock musketss, both\nhandguns and matchlock musketss required\na source of ignition before firing. The\nonly difference is that the matchlock\ngun only needs to be lit once, but it is\nstill troublesome and wastes a lot of\ntime. In contrast, flint lock musketss\nonly require flint and a fire striker.\nAlthough they also have the disadvantage\nof being prone to misfires. But compared\nto the previous ones, it's just a matter\nof pulling the trigger again. After\nhearing Wu&lt;unk&gt;s description, not only\nZhu Yuan Jang, but also Zhu Bao and Zhu\nD understood the difference between\nthem. However, even though he knew it\nwas a good thing, Zhu Yuan Jang was not\nin a hurry. Instead, he gave Wayi Wu a\nword of advice. Shiao Wu will\nresearching firearms delay the progress\nof the steam engine. If so, we should\nfocus on the steam engine. Don't worry,\nUncle Zu. I won't start with firearms\nright away. I'll just teach them the\nbasic theory first. What Chow Chow\nsought to do was never simply to provide\ntechnology, but to transmit the\nfoundations and methods of science. If\nyou only provide the technology, even if\nyou manage to manufacture something,\nyou'll only know how to do it, but not\nwhy you did it. Ultimately, technology\nwill stagnate. And what Way needs to do\nis to make them understand why. Zu Yuan\nJang nodded. As long as the steam engine\nwasn't affected, he didn't care about\nanything else. You believe that we woo\nwould definitely handle it well. If\nthat's the case, then we'll send two\nmore craftsmen to your place, which will\nsave you the trouble of teaching them\nagain and again. All right, please send\nthem over with peace of mind. The more\ntalents you have, the better for\ncultivating talent for our great Ming\ndynasty. Wayi Wu responded with a smile.\nBut before he could finish speaking, Zhu\nBao interjected. Since we're training\ntalent anyway, Shiao Wu, why don't you\nhelp your older brother train UA High\nSchool, too? Ah. Upon hearing Zhu\nBao&lt;unk&gt;s words, Weii Wu was completely\nstunned. What the heck? I was\npractically illiterate in the Ming\ndynasty. Apart from recognizing\ncharacters, I only knew the names of the\nfour books and five classics. To have an\nilliterate person train the crown\nprince, it is undeniable that science\nand technology are important, but they\nare only important for national\ndevelopment. Governing a country doesn't\nrely on technology. In fact, an emperor\nonly needs to know how to govern. Seeing\nway Wu&lt;unk&gt;s expression, Zhu Bao knew he\nhad misunderstood, so he explained, \"I'm\nnot asking you to teach Xianging to read\nand write, but I hope you can guide him\nand help him understand the importance\nof technology. I hope that Ua's vision\nand understanding of the world will be\nhigher and farther than those of his\nfather and grandfather.\" Upon hearing\nZhu Bao&lt;unk&gt;s words, Weii Wu understood,\n\"Indeed, as long as Zhu Xianging doesn't\ndie, he will surely become the emperor\nof the Ming dynasty in the future.\" As\nan emperor, in addition to political\nwisdom, vision, and cognition are also\nvery important. Just like Zhu Yuan Jang,\nwho was not very cultured, but knew he\nhad to do everything he could to\ncultivate Juao, Zuao was also putting\nhis heart and soul into nurturing Zhu\nXianging. Understanding this, Wayi Wu\nwas not surprised that Zhu Bao would\nmake this request. Brotherhu, how about\nthis? In the future, let Xionging visit\nthe Science and Technology Research\nInstitute every now and then. No matter\nhow much he talks about it, it's not as\nprofound as what he sees and experiences\nfirsthand. What do you think? Zhua also\nfelt that Wayi Wu&lt;unk&gt;s words made sense\nand immediately nodded in agreement. At\nthis moment, Wayi Wu had already walked\nup to Zhu Xiongying. UA, do you remember\nme? Upon hearing Weii Wu&lt;unk&gt;s question,\nZhu Xianging turned to look at Empress\nMa before answering. I remember Grandma\nsaid you are her nephew and Xionging\nshould call you Uncle Wei when she sees\nyou. Haha. Looking at Zu Xiong\nYing&lt;unk&gt;s adorable little face. Weii Wu\nlaughed and patted his head. He then\nglanced at Zhu Yuan Jang and Zu Bao and\nnoticed that they both had warm smiles\non their faces. For a moment, Wayi Wu\nfelt as if he were actually having a\nfamily gathering. Shing, do you remember\nwhat your uncle said? He would give you\nan even more interesting gift when you\nget better. Upon hearing Weii Wu mention\nmilitary force, Zhu Xiong Yying&lt;unk&gt;s\neyes immediately lit up. He used to\ntreat that toy car like a treasure and\nwouldn't allow anyone but Empress Ma to\ntouch it. I remember. I remember. Weii\nWu smiled slightly, turned around, and\nwent back into the room. When he came\nout again, he had a small drone in his\nhand. This children's drone was released\na few days ago. Although it's a\nchildren's model, it's not cheap at all.\nIt not only has intelligent obstacle\navoidance, but is also windproof and\nvibration resistant, making it easy for\neven children to operate. Wayi Woo\nplaced the drone steadily on the ground\nand prepared to demonstrate its\noperation. By the way, let Lo, Xiao Xu,\nand the whole family see what real high\ntechnology is. Before he could even\nbegin his demonstration, Jean Hai\nsuddenly ran into the yard. Young\nmaster, young master, the marquee of\nYong Chong is here again. Upon hearing\nJean Hai's words, Weii Wu couldn't help\nbut frown. Why is Lanu here again?\nDidn't I give him a good shock last\ntime? Or was it because the shock was\ntoo good? Where is he? At the main gate\nof our mansion. And moreover, he came\ncarrying brambles on his back to plead\nguilty with thorns on one's back. After\nJean Hai finished speaking, this was the\nfirst word that came to Wayi Wu&lt;unk&gt;s\nmind. However, Lu doesn't seem like the\nkind of person who would do something\nlike carrying thorns to apologize. If\nword got out that a dignified marquee\nwas apologizing to a mere Earl, it\nwouldn't be very respectable for Lan Yu.\nWhile Weiu was filled with doubt, Zhu\nYuan Jang and Zu Bao were also full of\nquestions. Obviously, Zhu Yuan Jang was\nunaware of this matter, and even the\ncrown prince, Zhu Bao, had not received\nany news. Uncle Zu, I'll go out and see\nwhat's going on. Chapter 87. Lan Yu,\nfollowing the example of the sages, went\nto the door to apologize with thorns on\nhis back. After greeting Zhu Yuan Jang,\nWayi Wu immediately stood up and stroed\ntowards the gate of the mansion. In any\ncase, since Lanu came to apologize with\nthorns on his back, his attitude was\nalready clear, even out of politeness or\nsomething else. Weii Wu could not\npretend not to see it. Otherwise, if\nword got out, people would say that Wayi\nWoo Chow Chow lacked magnanimity and was\nnot presentable. In front of the gate of\nthe Wei family mansion, Lanu stood\noutside the gate, her upper body\ncompletely naked and bound with thorns.\nThe surrounding area was filled with\ncommoners who had come to watch the\nspectacle. They might not recognize\nLonu, but they knew that he was a\nnobleman. Seeing nobles bound with\nthorns and coming to their door to beg\nfor forgiveness was something they could\ntalk about for days. Of course, what\nthey were more curious about was who the\nowner of this mansion was. They actually\nhave such great ability to make a\nnobleman imitate the sages of the past\nand put on such a good show. Just as the\npeople were speculating, the gates of\nthe Wei residence were suddenly opened.\nWeii Wu dressed in fine clothes walked\nout of the mansion. Seeing Lan Yu&lt;unk&gt;s\nattitude, he immediately stroed forward.\nTo be honest, Wayiu didn't take the last\nincident too seriously. Although Lan\nYu&lt;unk&gt;s intrusion into the mansion was\nimpolite, he did not suffer any loss. On\nthe contrary, Lan Yu suffered a\nconsiderable loss and was almost\nelectrocuted. Moreover, Lanu was Zu\nBao's handpicked sword for slaying\nbandits. For that reason alone, Chow\nChow wouldn't hold it against him. In\nfact, in order to have a better chance\nof killing on the battlefield in the\nfuture, he also needs to maintain a good\nrelationship with Lanu. Wayi Wu\noriginally wanted to intervene since the\nfeud between the two was not so serious\nas to warrant a formal apology. However,\nhe was still a step too slow. Just as he\nwas quickly approaching, Lan Yu suddenly\nmoved. He clasped his arms together,\nbowed his head, and knelt on one knee.\nLan Yu is a borish man. He was impolite\nand recklessly barged into the mansion\nbefore, and then he even spoke rudely\nand slandered the Earl of Chonglu.\nToday, I follow the example of the\nsages, binding myself with a thorn cane\nand kicking down the door to plead\nguilty. I asked the Earl of Chong Lu to\nwhip me with the thorn cane. I, Lu,\nwillingly accept the punishment. After\nspeaking, Lanu untied the hemp rope from\nher body, placed a thorny branch in her\nhands, and handed it over with both\nhands. Seeing this, Weii Wu quickly\nstepped forward, pushed aside the\nbrambles, and reached out with both arms\nto help Lanu up. It's all a\nmisunderstanding, Marque Yong Chong. Why\nhave you come to this? Please rise and\ncome with me to my residence for a\ndrink. Without waiting for Lu's\nresponse, he pulled her directly into\nthe mansion. This move disappointed the\npeople who had hoped to see his\nspectacle. It was not the outcome they\nwanted. Unfortunately, they couldn't see\nit anymore because the gates of the way\nresidents were already tightly closed.\nWhen he apologized outside the door\nearlier, Lon Yuji gave a general\nexplanation but did not go into details.\nAfter entering the mansion, before Wei\nWu could lead him to his own courtyard\nto meet old Jews family, Lanu bowed\nagain, clasped his hands in a fist\nsalute, and looked at Wayi Wu, speaking\nsincerely. Lord Chong Lo, besides the\nmatter of the offense, there is another\nmatter I must mention in this apology\nwhich is even more important than Lan\nYu&lt;unk&gt;s command. The crown prince's\nsmallox infection was cured thanks to\nthe divine medicine of the marquee of\nChong Lu, ensuring the eternal stability\nof our great Ming dynasty. Only then did\nWei Wu understand why Lan Yu had made\nsuch a big commotion. Even if Zhu Yuan\nJang deliberately made him do favors for\nLan Yu, it wouldn't have led Lan Yu to\nthis extent. But if it's about Zhu\nXianging, then it makes perfect sense.\nAs is widely known, Lan Yu is an even\nmore diehard princling than Die Hard.\nHe's a princling now, and he'll be a\ngrandson of the prince in the future.\nPlus, he's Zu Xiongy&lt;unk&gt;s maternal\nuncle. Now that Zhu Xionging has\nrecovered from smallpox thanks to Wei\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s medicine, Lan Yu&lt;unk&gt;s behavior\nis not surprising. Lord Yong X, you're\nmistaken. Saving Xionging is what we Wu\nshould do. After all, this child calls\nme uncle. Oh, by the way, Xianging is\ncurrently in the manor along with his\nmajesty and the empress as well as the\ncrown prince and the prince of Yen. Upon\nhearing that Zhu Yuan Jang&lt;unk&gt;s family\nwas there, Lan Yu immediately turned to\nleave. After all, he didn't consult the\ncrown prince or the emperor beforehand\nabout this incident. However, before he\ncould do anything, Wayi Wu pulled him\ntowards his own courtyard. Lord Chonglu,\nLord Chonglu, please wait a moment. Let\nme go home and change my clothes first.\nHer Majesty the Empress is still inside.\nAll right, but that's easy, too. We Woo\ncasually replied, then turned to look at\na servant not far away. Hey, you. Yes,\nyou take off your clothes and give them\nto Marqu Yong Chong. Hurry up. What you\nshy about, you big man. Lu couldn't\nrefuse, so she had no choice but to wear\nthe servant's clothes. They followed\nWeii Wu to the main courtyard of the\nmain house. As soon as he entered the\ncourtyard, Lan Yu quickly stepped\nforward to greet Zhu Yuan Jang, Empress\nMa, and Zu Bao. Empress Ma and Zhu Bao\ndidn't say anything, but Zu Yuan Jang\nsaid something lukewarm. All right, you\nbrute know how to emulate the sages now.\nIn that case, you should read more\nclassic text from the sages. If it\nweren't for Shiao Wu pleading for you\nthis time, we would have at least exiled\nyou, if not killed you. Ali, stand\naside. After Zhu Yuan Jang finished\nspeaking, he didn't even give Lan Yu a\nchance to speak and looked directly at\nWayi Wu. Xiao Wu ignore this brute.\nLet's take a look at this and see what\ngood stuff he gave our grandson. Seeing\nLan use pitiful submissive appearance.\nWayi Wu couldn't help but chuckle to\nhimself. I went to the drone, turned it\non, unfolded the propellers, and\nconnected it to the remote control.\nAfter confirming that everything was\ncorrect, we would took a few steps back\nand began to fiddle with the remote\ncontrol. Then, to everyone's\nastonishment, the drone's propellers\nbegan to spin at high speed. Then,\nwithout anyone touching it, it suddenly\nflew into the air and hovered. Zhu Yuan\nJang and Zhu Bao were all right. After\nall, they had seen quite a few good\nthings from Wei Wu. Empress Ma knew Weii\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s identity, and although she was\nsurprised, her emotions did not\nfluctuate much. Only Zude D and Lu were\nthe kind of guys who had never seen the\nworld. When they saw the drone take off,\ntheir expressions were as if they had\nseen a god descend to Earth. His eyes\nwere wide open, his mouth was agape, and\nhis eyes revealed a clear sense of\nstupidity. Only now did Lanu finally\nunderstand why the crown prince valued\nWu, this extraordinary man, so much. If\nthe previous act of carrying thorns to\napologize was largely due to wei Wu\nsaving Zhu Xianging. Now he was\ncompletely convinced by Wei Wu. Just as\nLan Yu and Zu D were in shock, Weii Wu\nalso spoke. This thing is called a\ndrone. Even a child can operate it and\nlet it fly freely in the sky. As he\nspoke, Weii Wu beckoned to Zhu Xianging,\nwho immediately ran excitedly to his\nside. Zhu Xianging was indeed\nintelligent. underway Wu&lt;unk&gt;s\ntoutelage. He quickly learned to control\nhimself, even show off a new toy they've\njust learned how to make. Zhu Xianging\neven had a drone fly over in front of\nLao Zhu, Xiao, and others, which drew\ngasps of surprise. Immediately\nafterwards, Wei Wu heard Zhu Yuan\nJang&lt;unk&gt;s voice from the side. Xiao Wu,\nis this what you use to throw things\ninto Lysan Chong's house? Chapter 8.\nTrading a sofa for an elephant carriage.\nMy lord, I've hit the jackpot. Upon\nhearing Zhu Yu and Jan&lt;unk&gt;s question,\nWayi Wu immediately laughed. Yes and no.\nThe items are similar, but mine is\nbigger. Bigger? How much bigger? Well,\nif we expand it, it should be 40 or 50\ntimes larger. After Wei Wu finished\nbegan to think about how to use this\nthing. Shiao Wu, how long will this\ndrone take to fly? What is the distance\nit will cover? and can we manufacture it\nfor future military use? Whether drones\ncan be used in the military is an open\nquestion. However, this question was\nraised in ancient times. Firstly,\nthere's no way to solve the charging\nissue. And secondly, the battery only\nlasts for about 30 minutes. Most\nimportantly, without a mobile phone,\neven if you can fly out, you can't see\nthe scene in the distance. Even with a\nmobile phone, but no base station, the\nimage would probably freeze after flying\nonly 1.5 km using radio waves. Most\nimportantly, old Jew is so audacious as\nto want to actually build this thing.\nWhat a load of rubbish. Even with the\ndevelopment of advanced industry and\nlater generations, this thing was still\nin its developmental stage and many\nproblems remained unsolved. So, after\nZhu Yuan Jang finished speaking, we woo\nsimply shook his head. Uncle Zu, you can\nforget about it. It will take several\nhundred years to manufacture this thing.\nIt can be used for military purposes,\nbut its continuous sailing time is too\nshort, only about the time it takes for\nan incense stick to burn. The key issue\nis that it requires electricity, and\nthere are too many complex problems\ninvolved that cannot be solved at\npresent. Upon hearing Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s\nreply, Xi Yuan Jangs eyes inevitably\ndimmed considerably. However, he could\nunderstand. After all, more than 600\nyears had passed, and the gap was simply\ntoo great. Seeing Zhu Yuan Jang&lt;unk&gt;s\nexpression, Wayi Wu didn't say anything\nmore. In fact, it can still be used if\nneeded. The power issue is that it has\nsolar panels and a high power portable\npower bank. He also has a mobile phone\nthat can receive drone signals and play\nthe footage. Although it was a newly\nrepaired machine, the memory was almost\nempty with only two songs on it.\nHowever, it's still perfectly fine to\nuse it as a medium for transmitting\nimages. The problem is that even if the\ncell phone were given to Zhu Yuan Jang,\nthere would be no problem and those two\nsongs would also suit him perfectly. But\nWayi Wu only has this one set of solar\npanels and power banks. He needs them\nhimself, so why would he take them out?\nBesides, a single small drone has little\neffect on the battlefield and is really\nunnecessary. Fortunately, Zhu Yuan Jang\ndid not dwell on this matter. Now that\nhe had eaten and drunk his fill and\nasked all the questions he needed to,\nZhu Yuan Jang patted his belly and stood\nup. All right, you young people can chat\nsome more. We'll head back to the palace\nwith your mother. After saying this, Zhu\nYuan Jang prepared to leave with Empress\nMa. But at that moment, Empress Ma\nlooked at Wayi Wu and asked him a\nquestion. Shia Wu, your aunt hasn't seen\nyou Xian for quite some time and misses\nher terribly. Would it be all right if\nshe came back to the palace to keep me\ncompany for a couple of days? Auntie,\nsince you've asked, how could I dare not\nagree? I'm also busy these days, so it\nwould be good for you to go back and\nkeep you company. Indeed, the Royal\nScientific Institute has now been\ncompleted. We knew very well that this\ninitial period would be his busiest\ntime. We need to not only teach those\ncraftsmen knowledge, but also set\ndirections and project for them to\npractice. They'll only be able to relax\nonce they complete their first project.\nIt will be good to let Yuan go back and\nkeep her ant company. After receiving a\nresponse from Wei Wu, Zhu Yuan Jang, and\nEmpress Ma took Zu Yuan and Zhu Xionging\nback to the palace. Only Zhu Bao, Zhu\nDi, and Lanu remained in the house. Weii\nWu had assumed that Zhu Di would speak\nfirst since he had seemed impatient\nsince the beginning. It turned out that\nZhuao was the first to speak. Xiao Wu,\nthere's something I need to talk to you\nabout privately. Let's go inside and\ntalk.\nWe would didn't ask any further\nquestions and turned to lead Zu Bao and\nthe other man into his large house.\nAlthough Zhu Yuan Jang and Zhu Bao\nvisited several times, they always ate\nand chatted in the courtyard. He had\nnever entered the house before, nor had\nhe ever asked to enter. This was the\nfirst time Zu Bao had come in. As soon\nas he entered, Zhuao looked around with\ngreat curiosity, finding everything\nfascinating. During this time, Wayi\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s room was furnished with some\nnew items, such as a refrigerator and an\nair cooler. It's just in time for\nsummer, as the weather is almost here.\nAfter entering the room, the two sat\ndown on the sofa, and Zhua was surprised\nagain. Fortunately, he was the crown\nprince after all and wouldn't be as\neasily startled as a little maid. Shia\nWu, you really know how to enjoy\nyourself in this room. Compared to\nyours, my Eastern Palace is not even a\nplace for a human to stay. Upon hearing\nthis, Wayi Wu simply shrugged and said\nwith a helpless expression, \"Brother Zu,\njust tell me what you've got your eye\non. I think the sofa is pretty good. I\ncan relax and rest during the breaks\nwhen I'm grading memorials.\" All right,\nI happen to have extra. I'll send\nsomeone over to move them to the East\nPalace later. Upon hearing Weii Wu&lt;unk&gt;s\nagreement, Zhu Bao laughed heartily,\npatted Wei Wu on the shoulder, and said,\n\"Don't worry. I won't take your things\nfor nothing. I see you don't even have a\ncarriage frame at home, so I'll trade\nyou an elephant chariot. Actually, a\nsofa is nothing to weigh.\" Woo! He\nalready has plenty, and it's not worth\nmuch money. He just hadn't expected Juao\nto trade him for something like an\nelephant chariot. That was a bit much.\nSimply put, an ivory carriage is a\nhorsedrawn carriage, but a luxurious one\ndecorated with ivory. Moreover, this\nthing has a status requirements. Not to\nmention, we woo evenly Shan Chong wasn't\nqualified to sit on it. Previously, only\nemperors were allowed to ride in\nelephantdrawn carriages, but the Ming\ndynasty relaxed this rule. Princes could\nalso ride in elephant carriages, though\nthe specifications were certainly\nparticular. Brotherh Zu, as far as I\nknow, only princes are qualified to ride\nin the imperial carriage. If you give me\nthis thing, I can only keep it as a\ndecoration. Zu Bao laughed heartily,\nthen asked Wayi Wu a question in return.\nDo you call me elder brother and mother?\nYes, but if the Earl travels in an\nelephant drawn carriage, the officials\nwill likely be dissatisfied. And before\nwaved his hand. I am the crown prince\nand you're my younger brother. What's\nwrong with my younger brother riding in\nan elephant carriage? I gave it to him.\nAnyone who's dissatisfied should come to\nme. Wow, Shiau. At this moment, you are\nsimply my idol. You are so damn\nhandsome. After hearing Zhu Bao&lt;unk&gt;s\nwords, Wu felt incredibly pleased. To be\nhonest, if Zhu Bao had taken out gold,\nsilver, and jewels, Wayi Wu probably\nwouldn't have felt anything. But this\nelephant chariot is completely\ndifferent. It's far more luxurious than\nany Rolls-Royce on the road. Just think\nof Jeang Ju Jing&lt;unk&gt;s luxurious sedan\nchair carried by 32 men which even had a\ntoilet and a bedroom. Although this was\nfabricated by Wong Shun, it is\nundeniable that there were indeed\nextremely luxurious carriages in ancient\ntimes. This Xianglu was the most\nprestigious and highclass luxury car in\nthe Ming dynasty. Seeing way Wu&lt;unk&gt;s\nexpectant expression, Zhu Bao smiled\nagain and then got down to business.\nActually, I came here to ask you, do you\nremember where the man in black you\ninjured last time was hurt? Chapter 89.\nThe smallox case. The water seems to be\na little too deep. Upon hearing Zhu Bao\nbring up serious matters, Wayi Wu\nregained his composure. The area\nslightly to the right of the left arm\nand lower abdomen. Wayi Wu could answer\nZuba's question almost without thinking.\nIt was the first time he had used a gun\nsince arriving in the Ming dynasty, and\nhe hadn't even managed to kill anyone.\nHe felt ashamed. Therefore, I remember\nthis event very vividly. However, Wayiu\nwas puzzled as to why Zhu Bowo suddenly\nasked him about this matter. Just as Wei\nWu was about to ask, Zhu Bao gave the\nanswer directly. If what you say is\ntrue, then without a doubt, that man in\nblack should be the unic beside me. Leo\nWayi Wu had met Leo before and he was\nquite impressed with him. After all, he\nwas the first unic to come to his house\nin the middle of the night and he\nbrought news that Zhu Xianging was\nseriously ill. Although Weii Wu knew\nthat the man in black was a unic, he\nnever doubted Leo. The reason is simple.\nLeo is someone close to Zuao. His\nposition to Zuao was equivalent to\nMaangs position to Zu Yuan Jang. Who is\nZuao? the most stable crown prince of\nthe Ming dynasty. A seasoned glutenous\nrice ball person who is white on the\noutside but black on the inside. They\nhave plenty of cunning and scheming. How\ncould they not even investigate the\nbackground of the people closest to\nthem? As it turned out, the person he\ndidn't suspect happened to be the man in\nblack. This contrast surprised we woo\nquite a bit. Brother Zu, have you found\nany evidence? No, but I noticed that\nLeong seems to be injured, even though I\nhaven't assigned him any tasks recently.\nZu Bao had a slight smile on his face\nthe whole time he spoke, although\nnothing was visible on his face. We wu\ncould sense a dangerous aura. If nothing\nunexpected happens, Lee Fo should be\nable to meet his end. If he is truly a\nmember of the Lou family, he would have\nto be able to perfectly conceal himself\nfor his entire life. Otherwise, if he\nreveals even the slightest clue, he will\nface certain death. However, just as\nwayu was thinking this, Zhu Bao gave a\ndifferent result. I want to find out why\nphone would listen to the control of the\nLou family to find out the reasons and\nalso to find out about the Lou family.\nUpon hearing this, we also had some\nspeculations in his mind. In his view,\nZhuao probably didn't want to expose the\nfact that Lady Lu had harmed the crown\nprince. After all, the crown princess\nhad just drowned a moment ago, and the\nLou family of Jang Nan was wiped out by\nthe imperial court the next second.\nAnyone with a modicum of common sense\ncould guess that there's something wrong\nhere, and it might even involve the\nsmallox issue. However, what Zu Bao said\nnext made Wei Wu realize that he had\nbeen overthinking things. If it were\njust the Lou family of Jang Nan, they\ncould be wiped out with a flick of the\nwrist. The same would be true for other\ngentry in Jang Nan as well. What really\nconcerns me is whether there is one or\ntwo more deeply hidden figures behind\nthese people. Upon hearing Zhu Bao&lt;unk&gt;s\nwords, Wayi Wu couldn't help but frown\nbehind a gentry. One or two deeper ones?\nThat would be a very serious problem.\nWhat is the gentry? The gentry are those\nofficials who have obtained academic\ntitles but have not entered official or\nleft office. These people can be\ndescribed as having power, influence,\nand money and possessing a certain\nstatus and influence in both local areas\nand official. However, they all share\nthe same identity. There are scholars\nwho have read extensively in classical\nChinese literature. Among the people\nbehind these people, we wu could only\nthink of one, the descendants of\nConfucious, the Confucious family of\nTufu. Confucious's greatness is beyond\ndoubt. He is one of the founders of\nChinese culture. It was only the\nunyielding spirit of Confucious\ndescendants who urged people to be loyal\nand the successive generations of\nofficials who submitted memorials to the\nDuke of Yening that summed up everything\nin a single sentence. So, here comes the\ncrucial question. In Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s view,\nZhua&lt;unk&gt;s guess was not without\npossibility. After all, Zhu Yuan Jang\nhad suffered a lot of humiliation at the\nhands of the Kong family, and his fiery\ntemper had caused them no small amount\nof trouble. However, no one broke off\nrelations completely. Zhu Yuan Jang\nneeded scholars from all over the\ncountry, and the Duke of Yin Shang dared\nnot offend the emperor to the death. We\ncan also see some clues from Zhu\nYunwin's rise to power. After Zhu Yun\nWan became emperor, he emphasized civil\nofficials over military officials,\nelevated the status of civil officials,\nand listened to their suggestions. As a\nresult, when the feudal lords were later\nweakened, many foolish decisions were\nmade based on the advice of those civil\nofficials. If the matter concerning the\nLou family is truly that deeply\ninvolved, then it is indeed quite\ndifficult to handle. Wayi Wu could only\nthink of this one. And as for whether\nthere might be another one, he had no\nclue at all. What puzzled him even more\nwas that Zhu Bao had no reason to tell\nhim about this. Just as he was deep in\nthought, Zhu Bao spoke again. I won't\ndeal with Leo for now so as not to alert\nhim. I want to see if there are really\nothers behind him. However, since you\nwere involved in this matter concerning\nthe Lou family, many people in the\npalace know about it and people in Jang\nwill definitely know as well. At this\npoint, Wayi Wu immediately took over the\nconversation. So, those people will\ndefinitely cause me trouble and they\nmight use any means necessary, right?\nYes, that's what I came to tell you.\nI've already increased security, but you\nmust be careful yourself. Be careful? Of\ncourse, we need to be careful, but they\nshould be the ones who need to be\ncareful. Weii Wu responded casually, a\ncold smile, curving his lips, \"Brother\nZhu, do you think that as long as I\ndon't rebel or betray the Ming Dynasty,\nwho could take my life?\" Zu Bao&lt;unk&gt;s\neyes narrowed and he said with a smile,\n\"My mother once said that as long as you\ndo not betray the Ming dynasty or the\nemperor, no one in the Ming dynasty can\ntouch you in the slightest. You may not\nknow this, but the Empress Daager never\ninterferes in court affairs. Yet no\nofficial dares to disagree with what she\nsays. Now I give you the same promise.\nAs long as I live, no one in this Ming\ndynasty can touch you in the slightest.\"\nWhen Empress Ma said this last time,\nWayi Wu responded with a light-hearted\njoke. But this time, he stood up and\ngave a very formal bow. Weii Wu, thank\nyou for your kindness, your highness.\nAfter giving his response, he\nimmediately reverted to his usual self.\nIn the next second, brother Zhu, with\nyou and aunt protecting me, even if they\nuse framing tactics, they can't do\nanything to me. In the end, they'll\nprobably have no choice but to send\nsomeone to kill me. If they really do\nthat, then I'll be serious. Otherwise, I\ncan personally go to Jang Nan and wipe\nout the Lu family, which will be a good\nopportunity to test whether there are\nreally people behind him. As soon as we\nWu finished speaking, Zhu Bao\nimmediately stopped him. No, if that's\nthe case, I might as well just wipe out\nthe Lu clan. But you must not risk your\nlife, and this matter must not be\nmentioned again. Although he was already\nprepared, Zhu Bao was still somewhat\namused and exasperated when he refused\nWayi Wu&lt;unk&gt;s offer. But what could he\nsay? People were worried about his\nsafety, and Wei Wu wouldn't be so\nungrateful as to complain. However,\nconsidering the situation, an idea\nsuddenly popped into his mind. How about\ntraining a group of gunmen? Shunlin and\nhis men should be quite good. At least\nwe'll have someone with guns when we\nattack the Japanese pirates in the\nfuture. Otherwise, even with a gun, I\ncan't kill many people by myself. Can\nkilling only 10 or 8,000 be called a\nmassacre. Moreover, if they're trained\nwell, and something really happens in\nthe future, even if I can't go out, I\ncan send them out to handle things, and\nI can decide who to execute. Chapter 90.\nThis isn't the Earl of Chonglu. This is\na living yama, just as Wei Wu and Zu Bao\nwere talking. In a secluded garden in\nSujo, two richly dressed middle-aged men\nwere discussing the smallox case. One of\nthem was Lu E, the patriarch of the Lu\nclan in Jang Nan, and the other was his\nthird brother, Lugu. The crown princess\nLu's father, Lu Bin, was Lu Yi&lt;unk&gt;s\nyounger brother and the second son in\nthe family, but he had already passed\naway. The two sat in a garden pavilion\nwith a charcoal stove and various tea\nsets on a stone table in the middle. Lu\nE calmly arranged the tea set while Lugu\nbeside him was clearly a little anxious.\nBrother Wanie died under mysterious\ncircumstances. Aren't you worried at\nall? How can you still calmly enjoy your\ntea? Lou E, who had just brewed the tea\nand was about to raise his cup to taste\nit, paused, then asked, \"What are you\nworried about? What are you worried\nabout?\" \"Of course, it's the smallox\nincident. If it gets exposed, our entire\nLou family will be executed.\" Lu Eie\ntook a sip of the fragrant tea, savoring\nthe taste for a moment before continuing\nto speak. How long has Wanie been dead?\nIt's been about half a month. If Wanie\nreally died in this matter, and there is\nsolid evidence, do you think the crown\nprince would let our Lou family off the\nhook? Lugu shook his head, no. That's\nit. News from the capital indicates that\nthe emperor and the crown prince do\nindeed suspect that the smallox case was\nmanipulated. Given Zu Yu and Jang&lt;unk&gt;s\ntemperament, if he discovers that we\nwere the ones pulling the strings behind\nthe scenes, do you think we'd still be\nhere drinking tea? More than half a\nmonth has passed, but the crown prince\nhasn't made a move against us, which\nmeans it's not about this matter. What's\nthere to be anxious about? As he spoke,\nLou, he casually pushed the teacup\ntowards his younger brother and then\ncontinued, \"Besides, when we decided to\ndo this, didn't we already know what\nwould happen if we failed? Since it's a\nhighstakes gamble, there are bound to be\nrisks. If this succeeds, our Lou family\nwill become the number one family in the\nMing dynasty. If we fail, we will die\nwithout a burial place. But since we are\nsafe now, why panic and lose our\ncomposure? Seeing his brother's calm and\ncollected demeanor, Lugu felt less\npanicked. Brother, if it wasn't the\nsmallox incident that was exposed, then\nwhy is Wanie's death so suspicious? Lu\nhe pondered for a moment before offering\nhis conjecture. It should be Leo. Wani\nhas something on him and he probably\nwants to kill Juan to protect himself at\nany time. Shouldn't we hurry up and find\na way to get rid of Leo? Otherwise, what\nif? No. Before Lu could finish speaking,\nLu he raised his hand to interrupt him.\nSmallox is still under investigation and\nthe emperor and crown prince will surely\ninvestigate it thoroughly. Now that\nWanie has been killed by Leong is a good\nthing for us. With her dead, all the\nleads have gone cold. I guess that's\nprobably why the emperor didn't take\naction against us. At this time, our Lou\nfamily must not get involved in this\nmatter. Otherwise, any action will bring\nabout her death. As for Leo, at this\npoint, a cold glint flashed in Lui's\neyes. He knows too much. This castrated\nman absolutely cannot be allowed to\nlive, but we don't need to get involved\nin this matter. Let the White Lotus sect\nclean up its own mess by letting the\nWhite Lotus sect deal with the traitors.\nSend a message to the White Lotus\nTauist. Also, tell them to get rid of\nthat guy named Wayi Woo while they're at\nit. That brat dares to ruin my Lou\nfamily's grand plan. Humph. After\nhearing Lu Yi's words, Lugu's face\nshowed some worry again. Brother Leaf\nFoam is in the palace. We can only make\na move when he leaves the palace. The\nWhite Lotus sect probably won't want to\ncause any trouble. No, they'll be\nwilling. If they want food, they'll have\nto give me face. Otherwise, what will\nthey send to those remnants of the\nformer Yuan dynasty? Looking at Lu's\ntimid and cowardly appearance, Lu E\ncouldn't help but sigh inwardly. If this\nweren't his own younger brother, the\nperson he trusted most, he would have\nwanted to have Lu Goo killed on the\nspot. How can someone who is so timid,\nhesitant, and lacking in cunning and\nshrewdness achieve great things? But\nsince he was still his younger brother,\nall he could do in the end was to offer\nwords of comfort. Don't worry, don't\nforget the followers of the White Lotus\nsect. Those madmen are bewitched and act\nlike death warriors. None of them are\nafraid of death. And even if we really\nfail, the White Lotus sect wouldn't dare\nto implicate us unless they don't want\nto buy food anymore. After Lu E finished\nspeaking, the anxiety on Lugu's face\nfinally disappeared. He down a tea in\none gulp and immediately got up to make\narrangements. After Lugu left, Lu E also\ngot up and left the pavilion, heading\ntowards the study. There is a secret\npassage in Lu Yi's study, a fact that\neven Lu was unaware of. Only Lu E and\nthe entire Lu family knew about it.\nAfter closing the door, Lu E entered the\nsecret passage alone. I implicated the\nWhite Lotus sect in the smallox\nincident, making them bear the emperor's\nwrath. After Lu E finished speaking,\nthere was no response from the secret\npassage, nor did he linger. After saying\nthat, he came out of the secret passage\nas if nothing had happened. An\nundercurrent was slowly creeping towards\nWeii Wu without him even realizing it.\nMeanwhile, Weii Wu, the protagonist, was\nsitting on the sofa with Lanu eating\npopsicles. That's right. It's an ice\npop. After finishing his business, Zhu\nBao gave a few more instructions not to\ntake any risks and then left with Zu.\nOriginally, Zhu had many questions for\nWei Wu about overseas matters, but he\nhad no choice but to go along. After the\ntwo left, Wei Wu took Lan Yu into the\nhouse and also took two popsicle from\nthe refrigerator. This thing wasn't\nfound in a package. He made it himself\nby juicing fruit. As a nobleman, Lanu\nnaturally had an ice seller at home and\nwas quite familiar with ice. He was\nmainly curious about what that\nrefrigerator was, but he didn't dare to\nask any more questions. Wayi Wu did see\nthrough it, but he was too lazy to\nexplain and got straight to the point.\nMarque, his highness, the crown prince,\nhas already told you about the attack on\nthe Japanese pirates, hasn't he? Lu\nnodded and answered without any\nconcealment. That's right. His highness\ndid give instructions. What did the Earl\nof Chong Li want to say? Wayi Wu cleared\nhis throat and then expressed his\nthoughts. I want to say that we must\ncarry out the extermination of our race,\nbut we should leave a large number of\nJapanese pirates behind to help us mine\nto ensure they don't slack off and to\nmake mining more efficient. Shouldn't we\nestablish a reward and punishment\nmechanism to motivate them? I've heard\nthat we have a form of punishment called\nriding the wooden donkey. It would be a\ngood way to punish the Japanese pirates\nwho mind the least in the future. Even a\nrough man like Lan Yu couldn't help but\ntwitch his eye when he heard Wayi\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s words. What a deep grudge they\nmust have. Well, Lord Chonglu, as far as\nI know, the wooden donkey is for\nadulterous women. Men don't seem to need\nit. Don't worry, it will work. As long\nas there's a hole, it will work. Oh, by\nthe way, could you replace that stick on\nthe wooden donkey with a kind with\nbarbs? It has to be said that this\nquestion stumble on you. I've never seen\nthis before either. How about I go ask\naround for you later? Okay. It would be\neven better if it were made of iron,\npreferably with a fire underneath so\nthat the iron can be heated red hot.\nUpon hearing this, Lu's impression of\nWeii Woo completely changed. That young\nand handsome face suddenly had a\nmonstrous fanged look. This isn't the\nEarl of Chong Lu. He's a living yama.\nChapter 91. The Science and Technology\nInstitute opens. Professor Weii's first\nlesson begins. However, since Weii Wu\nhad spoken, Lanu naturally wouldn't\nobject. Anyway, those Japanese pirates\nare going to die eventually, so how they\ndie doesn't matter at all. However, Wayi\nWu was referring to the reward and\npunishment mechanism, and the punishment\nhas already been mentioned. Now, Lanu is\nquite curious about the award, but after\nwaiting for a long time, Wayi Wu showed\nno sign of wanting to continue speaking.\nIt was as if they hadn't even considered\nthe question. So Lan Yu couldn't help\nbut ask, \"Uncle Chongla, what about the\nprize?\" Upon hearing Lan Yu&lt;unk&gt;s\nquestion, Wayi Wu looked at him with a\npuzzled expression. \"An award? What\naward? Isn't it about rewards and\npunishments? You just mentioned\npunishments. So what about rewards?\nWe've already been so merciful, letting\nthem live to mine for us. Isn't that an\nimmense blessing?\" Upon hearing this,\nLan Yu suddenly realized that her guess\nwas indeed correct. We Wu never even\nconsidered the award from beginning to\nend. Seeing how much Wei Wu hated the\nJapanese pirates, Lan Yu understood the\ndirection of their conversation. It must\nbe said that Lan Yu really has a way\nwith things. No wonder she later dared\nto sleep with the princess consort of\nthe great Yuan dynasty. After a\ncompletely inhumane exchange between the\ntwo, when Lanu left the Wayi residence,\nshe had a bottle of Urgu, a type of\nChinese liquor given to her by Weii Wu,\nthe Red Star brand. After Lu left, Wayi\nWu did not intend to stay at home. After\nall, Juda had made a pledge to build the\nsteam engine within a month. To be\nhonest, the real difficulty in building\na steam engine wasn't the steam engine\nitself. There are readily available\nblueprints for the structure. The key\nissues are material strength, sealing,\nand the precision components required\nfor transmission. Fortunately, ancient\ncraftsmen were able to do these three\nthings. So, we should never\nunderestimate the wisdom of the\nancients. During the Ming dynasty,\nlowcarbon steel could already be\nproduced and the ceiling problem was not\nsolved by using rubber. All you need to\ndo is make piston rings with copper for\nsealing. As for the precision parts\nrequired for transmission, they can be\nmade by hand without a machine tool.\nIt's just a little slower. At the same\ntime, he took out a book from the\nsystem, notes on the history of science\nand technology, steam power. This book\nnot only records the development of the\nsteam engine in detail, but also\nincludes blueprints for each of its\ncomponents. Of course, the book wouldn't\nbe given to the craftsman. He would only\nprovide the key information. The thought\nthat there was only one month left made\nWeii Woo feel somewhat anxious. If I\ncan't win her over, I'll never get a\nwife. It's a matter of lifelong\nhappiness, so I have to go all out.\nAfter muttering something to himself,\nWayi Wu immediately sent someone to\nfetch Shinllin and Jean Hai. Shinl\nsuffered only superficial injuries\nwithout any bone damage, and after a\nperiod of recuperation, he is almost\nfully recovered. Soon, all 12 guards of\nthe household arrived. Jean Hai, take\ntwo men to the Ministry of Works and\nbring the craftsmen I've selected to the\nInstitute. Shunlin, you take the rest of\nthe men and come with me to the Academy\nof Sciences. After saying that, Wayiu\nled Shan Lin away from the residence and\nheaded straight for the site of the\nScience and Technology Institute outside\nthe city. It must be said that Lau chose\na really good location, not only close\nto the Yangze River, but also not far\nfrom Leoa County. It should be noted\nthat Leoa County has been a well-known\nmining and iron casting area since\nancient times. The Ministry of\nIndustries iron smelting facilities were\nlocated here, so there was no need to\nworry about a shortage of iron or in the\nfuture. After leading his men into the\nencampment, Wayi Wu couldn't help but\nexclaimed that the area was truly vast.\nThe entire estate was transformed. It\ncould easily accommodate two or 300\npeople. However, the entire village is\nnow surrounded and heavily guarded\noutside. Weiiwu wandered around the\nestate a few times to familiarize\nhimself with the surroundings and then\ncame to the largest room in the estate.\nAccording to Weii Wu&lt;unk&gt;s arrangement,\nthis large room was initially intended\nfor him to use for teaching. So, not\nonly were the tables and chairs\ncomplete, but even the podium was\nprepared according to requirements.\nAfter entering the room, he took out\nthree items from the system and placed\nthem on his lectern. A projector, a\nmobile phone, and a set of\nwalkie-talkies. After putting these\naway, he took out the only power bank he\nhad from the warehouse. After about an\nincense sticks time, Jean Hai arrived\nwith 26 craftsmen. Originally, there\nwere 24 people, but the emperor sent two\nmore craftsmen to develop firearms.\nAfter everyone sat down, only we woo\nstood at the front of the room looking\nat them. You are all the best craftsmen\nin the Ministry of Works, but for\nvarious reasons, you are isolated and\nostracized by others. But here, there's\nno need to curry favor with superiors or\nflatter them. You just need to do what\nyou're good at and are proficient in.\nHowever, you should be prepared because\nyou will find that the world is not\nquite what you thought. At this stage,\nWayi Woo is not going to talk to them\nabout atmospheric pressure, the periodic\ntable, or basic physics. Because no\nmatter how much you say, it's useless.\nOnly by breaking down these people's\npreconceived notions can we better\naccept new things. Letting them witness\nthe wonders of technology firsthand is\nmore effective than saying a thousand\nwords. Perhaps you're wondering why you\nwere transferred here. Now I can tell\nyou. His majesty ordered me to create\nsomething that could move on its own\nwithout the need for human or animal\npower. I called it the steam engine. It\ncould be installed on a ship and it can\nstill sail quickly at sea even without\nwind sails or or oars. As soon as we woo\nfinished speaking, someone stood up\nexcitedly. However, this person's\nexcitement wasn't the kind of excitement\nthat comes from being excited, but\nrather the kind of excitement that comes\nfrom being full of doubt.\nWithout wind, sails, and oars, a boat\ncan only drift aimlessly on the water.\nAfter this person finished speaking,\nSeong, who had previously had contact\nwith Wei Wu, also stood up. Yes. Yes. A\nship like that can't even move forward,\nlet alone travel fast. It's simply\nimpossible. Faced with the two men's\nquestions, Wayi Wu showed no\ndissatisfaction. On the contrary, he was\nvery happy because that's what he wants\nto dare to speak out, ask questions, and\nchallenge others. Only by opening up\none's mind can sparks be generated and a\nspirit of breaking with conviction be\ncultivated. So, after the two finished\nasking their questions, Wayi Wu simply\nreplied with one sentence. In ancient\ntimes, Gong Shu ban made a wooden magpie\nthat could fly in the sky for three days\nand three nights without landing.\nSonghong, you should know this best.\nDuring the Han Dynasty, Zhuang created\nthe wooden ox and flowing horse, which\ncould carry a year's worth of grain and\ntraveled dozens of miles a day,\ntransporting provisions for an army of\n100,000. The ancient sages were able to\ncreate such wondrous things. So, why do\nyou think what I say is impossible?\nDon't you even have the courage to\nfollow in their footsteps? Upon hearing\nWeii Woo&lt;unk&gt;s words, the craftsmen were\nat a loss for words. After all, these\nare true stories recorded in history\nbooks, and they are deeds that they\ngreatly admire. Seeing that the\ncraftsman remained silent, Weii Wu spoke\nagain. \"If I said I could make two\npeople have a normal conversation, even\nif they were 10 mi apart, would you\nstill not believe me?\" Undoubtedly, Wei\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s words were once again met with\nskepticism from the craftsmen. Some even\nsecretly cursed Wayi Woo as a fool and\nfelt hopeless about their future. Amidst\nthe questioning gazes of all the\ncraftsmen, we woo picked up the\nwalkie-talkie on the table. Chapter 92.\nShocking. The talking blackbox. It's not\nsurprising that these people would have\ndoubts. After all, that's a 10-mi\nstretch. In a Ming dynasty, one Lee was\nabout 550 m. So Tin Lee would be more\nthan 5,500 meters. At such a distance,\nyou can't even hear the other person's\nvoice, let alone talk. Even shouting in\na place like the grassland would be\nimpossible. In their view, the idea that\nthe two could talk from 10 mi apart was\nsimply wishful thinking. But for Wayi\nWoo, the walkie-talkie in his hand was\nsomething he could do with ease.\nAlthough his walkietalkie isn't\nparticularly high-tech, it still has a\ncommunication range of 10 km. 10 lead\ntranslates to less than 6 km. In ancient\ntimes, in an environment free from any\ninterference, that's exactly it. After\nturning on the walkie-talkies, we woo\ntook one of them, pressed the call\nbutton, and began testing. Hello. Hello.\n123 ABC\n1212. Very good. No problem. Weii Wu\nconducted a simple test, but the result\nleft all the craftsmen wideeyed. The\nclassroom, which had been noisy and\nchaotic, suddenly became so quiet you\ncould hear a pin drop. The room was as\nsilent as if all 26 people in the\nclassroom had vanished. What did they\nsee? Or rather, what did they hear? I\nheard Wayi Woo speak. It was a normal\nvoice, but I couldn't understand the\nwords. But that's not important. What's\nimportant is that the sound came from\nanother blackbox. Just as the craftsmen\nwere in a daysaze, we wu waved to Seong.\nTake this with you and go anywhere\nwithin 10 miles. When you get there,\njust talk to me using this. Sean took\nthe walkie-talkie from Wei Wu with a\nblank expression, but couldn't move his\nleg. Seeing this, we wu simply called\nJean Hai over and asked him to take\nSeong out of the classroom. At this\npoint, the craftsmen finally came to\ntheir senses. My god, did you guys hear\nthat? That black box actually made a\nsound. That's not the point. Didn't you\nsee? Vice Dean Wei was talking while\nholding up another black box. My god,\nhow' they do that? Is it some kind of\nmagic? The 26 craftsmen below were\ndiscussing amongst themselves, and the\nman who had first stood up to question\nWei Woo stood up again. My lord, could\nyou please enlighten us as to why your\nvoice is appearing in another black box?\nWayi Wu was still deeply impressed by\nthe person who was the first to stand up\nand question him. Seeing that this was\nthe only person in the room who dared to\nstand up and ask him a question, he also\nbecame somewhat curious about this\nperson. What's your name and who are you\ncraftsman? My name is Sun Chong and I am\na blacksmith. We nodded then asked a\nquestion in return. Sun Chong, I ask you\nwhat is sound to you. What is sound?\nUpon hearing this question, Sun Chong\nimmediately frowned. A sound is just a\nsound. What else could it be? Just as\nSun Chong was wondering, Wayi Wu gave\nthe answer directly. Let me tell you,\nthe essence of sound is vibration. Sound\nwaves are generated by the vibration of\nobjects and propagate through the air.\nTo put it simply, your throat is a\npebble and the world is a lake. When you\nspeak, it's like throwing a pebble into\nthe lake. It must be said that Wayi\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s analogy is quite good, although\nit is not particularly accurate.\nHowever, it allows craftsmen to have a\nvery intuitive understanding. You can\ntry placing your hand on your throat and\nfeel whether your throat vibrates when\nyou speak. As soon as we woo finished\nspeaking, the craftsman immediately\ntried it out as he had instructed. As it\nturned out, we woo was right. But the\ncraftsmen were not surprised. You can\nsense this even when people are talking\nto you normally. What truly concerned\nthem was the impact of Wei Woos. The\nessence of his voice was to resonate\nwith the power of his pronouncements.\nSun Chong in particular felt this very\ndeeply as a blacksmith. My lord, the\nsound is produced when iron objects are\nstruck together because the air\nvibrates. I have a question. What is\nthis air you're referring to? Wayiw\nsmiled slightly and casually explained.\nAir is a general term just like pig\niron, rot iron, and refined iron are all\ncalled iron. Air is composed of a\nvariety of gases and is ubiquitous in\nthis world. The air that envelopes us\nand helps us breathe is one of them. But\nyou wouldn't understand even if I\nexplained it now. I will teach you this\nknowledge little by little in the\nfuture. After speaking, Wayi Woo tapped\non the table and the classroom instantly\nfell silent. As I said, sound is\nproduced by the vibration of an object,\ncreating ripples like water, which\ngradually spread out. Just like ripples\non water, they gradually dissipate as\nthey travel. So, you can't hear them\nonce you're too far away. And this\nwalkie-talkie converts these sound waves\ninto electromagnetic waves that can\ntravel further so that they can be\nreceived by another walkie-talkie. To be\nhonest, even we woo felt a chill run\ndown his spine when he talked about\nthis, explaining something clearly\nrequires a great deal of knowledge of\nphysics. Fortunately, the artisans were\nall captivated by the novel things he\nwas saying. They were like thirsty\nchildren, greedily trying to extract the\nmilk of knowledge from Wei Wu. However,\ntheir greed was interrupted by a sudden\nsound. The reason was that Seong&lt;unk&gt;s\nvoice suddenly came through the\nwalkie-talkie in Wayi Wu&lt;unk&gt;s hand.\nHello, hello 123 IBC want to wu, your\nexcellency, your excellency, can you\nhear me? Hearing Se Jong&lt;unk&gt;s somewhat\napprehensive yet expectant voice on the\nwalkie-talkie. The classroom fell silent\nonce again. Then Wayu picked up the\nwalkie-talkie and said, \"I heard you. I\nheard you. Where are you now?\" \"Hello.\nHello. 123 abs 1212. Your Excellency,\ncan you hear me? Your Excellency, I\nheard you. Don't imitate me and talk to\nme normally. Hello. Hello. 123 IBC1212.\nLord, what's going on? I can't hear you.\nUpon hearing this, Wayi Wu finally\nunderstood what had happened. He forgot\nto tell Jang to release the\nwalkie-talkie button after he finished\nspeaking. Just as we was considering\nwhether to send someone to inform Xang,\na voice came through the walkie-talkie\nagain. My lord, is it because I'm\npressing this that you can't&lt;unk&gt;t\nspeak? Let me loosen it and see. Yoho.\nSeang&lt;unk&gt;s mind works pretty fast. Upon\nhearing Jehong&lt;unk&gt;s words, Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s\neyes lit up and he couldn't help but\npraise him in his heart. After waiting a\nfew seconds without hearing Seong&lt;unk&gt;s\nvoice again, we wu immediately press the\ncall button. Seang, did you hear me? You\nhave to release the button after you\nfinish speaking. Also, tell me where you\nare and how far away you are. My lord,\nmy god, I really heard your voice, my\nlord. This This is truly amazing. All\nright, stop making a fuss. Tell me your\ncurrent distance first. Upon hearing\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s voice, Sanjong quickly composed\nhimself. My lord, I had Jeang, the\nbodyguard, take me on horseback for a\nlong distance, about 4 miles. I never\nexpected to actually be able to talk to\nyou. All right, all right, come back now\nthat you tried it. After ending his\nconversation with Songhong, Wayi Wu\nlooked at the other craftsmen. Is there\nanyone else who wants to try it out for\nthemselves? Chapter 93. The steam engine\nproject is officially initiated. Upon\nreceiving Weii Wu&lt;unk&gt;s order, Sean\nreturned shortly afterward. Then, filled\nwith longing for new things, the\ncraftsman lined up one by one to try out\nthe walkie-talkies. Seeing this, Wayi Wu\nsimply handed over what he had to them,\nletting them experience it for\nthemselves. About half an hour passed\nand Wayi Wu put the walkie-talkie away\nwhen he thought it was about time.\nHowever, the craftsman's curiosity about\nwalkietalkies was clearly not something\nthat could be easily dispelled. After\nWei Wu withdrew his order, Sun Chong\ncouldn't help but stand up again. Siri\njust said that this walkie-talkie can\nconvert sound waves into electromagnetic\nwaves. We're electromagnetic waves. Even\nif I explain electromagnetic waves, you\nwon't understand them for now. Your\ncurrent foundation is insufficient and\nyou need to study. After speaking, Wayi\nWu gestured for Sun Chong to sit down\nand then looked at everyone and said,\n\"Having witnessed the magic of\nwalkie-talkies, do you still think a\nboat can't move without wind, sails, or\nores?\" The ancients could create wooden\nmagpies and wooden oxmen and flowing\nhorses. And now we can create steam\nengines that allow ships to move\nautomatically without wind. But I can't\ndo this by myself. I need you all to\nwork with me to create it together. To\nbe honest, even after witnessing the\nwonders of walkie-talkies, the craftsman\nstill had little confidence in the steam\nengine. Because the walkietalkie and the\nsteam engine that we woo mentioned have\nabsolutely nothing in common. They\nreally don't have a concrete concept.\nUltimately, it's a matter of cognition.\nWayi Wu understood this as well. So when\neveryone was silent, he gave them a\nconcrete concept. You've all boiled\nwater before, right? When a kettle\nboils, doesn't the lid pop open from the\nsteam? The craftsman looked at Wayi Woo,\nwondering why he brought this up, but\nthey all nodded in agreement. The steam\nengine I'm talking about works on a\nsimilar principle, using steam to\nconvert it into power. But my lord, the\nlid of a teapot can be held down with a\nhand. So how can it be used to propel a\nlarge ship? As soon as Wei Wu finished\nspeaking, Seong raised another question,\nwhich Wei Wu then answered. \"Have you\nnoticed that when you hold the lid up, a\nlot of hot water will spray out from the\nspout? Because the water vapor has an\noutlet, you think it has little power\nand can be easily contained. If you\ndon't believe me, you can ask Sunshine\nto make you a kettle without a spout and\nthen seal the lid. Try boiling water\nagain later, but I advise you to stay\naway from it or the exploding kettle\nmight kill you.\" After listening to Wei\nWoo&lt;unk&gt;s words, the craftsmen all\nlowered their heads and fell into deep\nthought. At this point, they seem to\nhave a vague concept of hot steam,\nthough not a very deep one. Just as they\nwere deep in thought, Wayi Woo spoke\nagain. I have a lot to teach you, but a\ntall building starts from the ground up,\nand everything has a foundation building\nprocess. Next, you will learn from me\nand use what you have learned to help me\nbuild the steam engine. Remember, this\nwill be the greatest opportunity of your\nlives. A precious chance for you to go\ndown in history as artisans. Before the\ncraftsmen could react, Wayi Woo began\nfiddling with the cell phone and\nprojector on the table. The craftsmen\nwere once again astonished when a\nprojected image appeared on the wall.\nWhen they first saw the walkie-talkie,\nthey could still talk and even exclaim\nin amazement. But when they saw what was\nhappening before them, they were\nspeechless, completely terrified. After\na long while, someone finally came to\ntheir senses and pointed a trembling\nhand at the wall. Lord, lore, this this\nthing is a celestial being. What? Why is\nit? Seeing that the man was stammering\nand unable to utter a complete sentence,\nWu simply waved his hand to interrupt\nhim. All right, it's not a celestial\nartifact. Remember, we are the Royal\nTechnology Research Institute.\nEverything here is a product of\ntechnology. You may not understand now\nor in the future, but as long as you're\nwilling to learn from me and have an\nexploratory and knowledge-seeking\nmindset. I believe that as long as you\nwork hard, one day you will be able to\nunderstand and even create things that\nothers will not understand. After\nhearing what we woo said, the craftsmen\ndid not remain calm. Instead, they all\nbecame excited. What is happening before\nour eyes can hardly be called a miracle.\nBut Chong Leo told them that it was\ncreated by human effort and he was even\nwilling to teach them how not to be\nexcited. Fortunately, despite their\nexcitement, the craftsman did not\ndisrupt Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s class. Instead,\nthey looked at him with anticipation.\nJust as everyone was filled with\nanticipation, we woo reached out and\ngently swiped his finger across the\nphone screen. The next second, a\nstructural diagram of a reciprocating\nsteam engine was projected onto the\nwall. At first, the craftsmen were\namazed by the projected image, but they\nquickly shifted their attention. All\neyes were on the structural diagram. The\ncarpenters are the most concerned\nbecause their skills are most directly\nrelated to the structure. Subsequently,\nunder Wei Woos wrote explanation. The\ncraftsman learned how the steam engine\nworked. Then, we woo switched to the\nnext picture and explained them to the\ncraftsman one by one. Throttle valves,\ncentrifugal speed controllers, steam\nboilers, safety valves, pressure gauges,\netc. These things may sound complicated,\nbut they are actually not simple at all.\nAt least for Wei Woo, it was not simple.\nMany things are easy to talk about, but\nyou'll know how difficult they are once\nyou try them yourself. Modern people all\nknow that glass can be made by firing\nquartz sand, but how many people can\nactually make it at home? The principle\nis the same as that of the steam engine\ntoday. Fortunately, Wayi Wu only needed\nto give instructions. The remaining\nproduction issues were left to the\ncraftsmen. Three firearms craftsmen were\nexcluded from the selection of craftsmen\nfrom the Ministry of Works. This time,\nthe remaining workers consisted of six\nblacksmiths, seven carpenters for brick\nlayers, and six other craftsmen of\nvarious kinds. After pondering for a\nwhile, Wei Wu made a decision. He was\ninitially worried about whether he could\nfind the materials needed to make the\nsteam engine. After learning more about\nit, I was completely relieved. The\nwisdom of the ancients was no less than\nthat of later generations. The method of\nmaking coke existed as early as the Song\nDynasty, and blast furnaces even\nappeared earlier than coke. The Ming\nDynasty basically used blast furnaces to\nsmelt iron. Although the blast furnaces\nat that time were still relatively\nrudimentary. Sun Chong, there are six of\nyou blacksmiths in a group and you are\nthe group leader of the blacksmith\ngroup. Your next task is to manufacture\nthese parts according to the blueprints\nand the requirements are to be precise.\nThe cylinder block and base are made of\ncast iron. The crankshaft and connecting\nrod are made of rot iron or mild steel\nand the ceiling piston rings are made of\ncopper. After speaking, Wayi Wu looked\nat Sangh,\nthe seven of you will form the carpentry\nteam. You will be the team leader and\nwill be mainly responsible for\nthoroughly studying the blueprints and\nworking with Sun Chong to create the\nparts. In addition to studying the\nblueprints, I want you to build a water\nwheel by the river because we will build\nour own blast furnace in the future.\nFinally, Wayi Wu looked at the four\nbrick layers, the stonemason, and the\nsculptor. You six are the construction\nteam. The task of building the blast\nfurnace is assigned to you. The\nblueprints are here. Take a look. As he\nspoke, Wayi Wu swiped his phone screen\nwith one hand, and a standard and\ncomplete drawing appeared on the wall.\nChapter 94. The goddess is willing, but\nfears the king is indifferent. In fact,\nregarding the steam engine, Wayi Wu did\nnot need to smelt iron himself. Just get\nthe iron works under the Ministry of\nWorks to cooperate. However, the nature\nof the research institute dictates that\nit must have its own blast furnace and\nother related supporting facilities. We\ncan't always go to the iron works every\ntime we have an idea or creative\nconcept. Having our own blast furnace\nmakes it easier to conduct research. The\nbrick layers were instantly drawn to the\nimage of the blast furnace projected\nonto the wall. A brick layer is not the\nkind of person who lays tiles on a roof.\nThe so-called brick layer is actually\nalso called a kil worker. Building\nhouses is their craft, but so is the\nkiln used to fire porcelain. With the\nblueprints, it is not difficult to\nmanufacture a standard blast furnace. To\nbuild this blast furnace, I need you to\nfirst produce refractory bricks, the\nkind that are more refractory than the\nbricks commonly used in current iron\nsmelting furnaces. Wayiws voice\nattracted the attention of several brick\nlayers. Immediately afterwards, a brick\nlayer stepped forward and said, \"Lord,\nstop. There are no lords here at the\nAcademy of Science and Technology. Call\nme vice president way.\" Okay, Vice Dean\nWei, I think I have a solution for the\nrefractory brick problem. It's more\nfireresistant than ordinary refractory\nbricks. Weii Wu had originally planned\nto wait a while, but unexpectedly he was\npleasantly surprised immediately. May I\nhave your name? Wu Chong, a despicable\nman. Okay, Wu Chong, tell me a method\nfirst. If it works, you'll be the leader\nof the construction team from now on.\nUpon receiving Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s promise, Wu\nChong immediately smiled. That's right.\nWhen I was helping them build kills in\nJinga Jun, I discovered type of clay\nthere. This clay is white and is also\ncalled dolomite. It is a material used\nto fire porcelain. But I found that this\nclay is very resistant to high\ntemperatures. I have tried it and even\nin a blast furnace, it does not cause\nthe masonry to crack and crumble like\nother clays. Clap clap clap clap. After\nWu Chong finished speaking, Wayi Wu\nimmediately raised his hand to applaud\nhim. It wasn't because he solved the\nproblem of refractory bricks, but\nbecause his spirit of exploration\ndeserves encouragement. Many people have\nlikely come into contact with dolomite,\na material used in firing porcelain.\nWhile others stuck to the old ways and\nonly use it to make porcelain, Wu Chong\ndared to try using it to make other\nthings.\nOf course, others may have tried it, but\nthat doesn't matter. What matters is\nthat Wu Chong is his man. Very good, Wu\nChong. I'm applauding you to let you\nknow that I admire your spirit of daring\nto try new things. Keep it up. After\nspeaking, Wayi Wu looked at the other\ncraftsmen. You are the same. You don't\nneed to stick to the old ways. You need\nto be brave enough to try and innovate\nin order to make progress. Remember our\nresearch institutees motto. Make bold\nhypotheses, verify carefully, adjust\ncontinuously, strive for excellence, and\nfinally prioritize safety. After setting\nthe tone for the research institute,\nWeii Woo continued to assign tasks.\nBesides the blacksmith team, carpentry\nteam, and construction team, there are\nthree firearms craftsmen and four other\ncraftsmen remaining. There were\npainters, gold smiths, silver smiths,\nand copper smiths, while stonemasons and\nsculptors were assigned to the\nconstruction team. Since the goldsmiths,\nsilver smiths, and bronzemiths were not\nneeded for the time being. And since\nthey dealt with metal, we wu assigned\nthem to the blacksmith group as\nassistants. In the end, only the painter\nremained, but his importance was beyond\nquestion because all the blueprints that\nwe woo just showed me need to be drawn\nup by him and handed over to several\ngroups. After assigning tasks to\neveryone, we woo continued lecturing.\nEven as dusk settled outside, the\ncraftsman remained engrossed in\nabsorbing new knowledge. Finally, we\ncouldn't take it anymore and ended the\nlecture for the day. But the most\ncrucial point is that he didn't prepare\nmuch before coming and he was completely\ndrained. So, he had to leave. Before\nleaving, Wayiu gave him one last\ninstruction. Other things can be done\nlater, but the steam engine must be the\ntop priority. After giving these\ninstructions, he left. As for these\ncraftsmen, from the moment they entered\nthe Academy of Sciences, they were\ndestined to stay here. Not only will\nthey be unable to leave, but their\nfamilies will also be brought to live in\nthe village. After a busy day at the\nresearch institute, Wayi Wu went\nstraight to bed as soon as he got home,\nexhausted. Meanwhile, in the cunning\npalace of the Forbidden City, Empress Ma\nwas having a heart-to-heart talk with Zu\nYushuan. Yusuan, I've been taking care\nof Xianging these past few days, which\nhas been a bit unfair to you, making you\nwork as a maid all this time. Mother, I\ndon't feel wronged at all. On the\ncontrary, I feel very happy because\nthere aren't many rules there. Upon\nhearing Empress Ma's words, Zhu Yuwan\nslowly shook her head and responded\nsoftly. At this moment, Zhuan had\nchanged back into her princess attire.\nHer gorgeous attire and exquisite face\nwere simply breathtaking. Empress Ma was\nsomewhat surprised by Zhu Yuan&lt;unk&gt;s\nanswer. The Yuzu of the past would never\nhave spoken like this when facing\nherself. To say that there aren't many\nrules on Wei Woos is tantamount to\ncomplaining that there are too many\nrules in the palace and that there is no\nfreedom. In the past, Yuan would only\nsay the first half of the sentence and\nwould never say the rest. However, this\nkind of change is something Empress Ma\nwould like to see. After pondering for a\nmoment, Empress Ma looked at Ju Yuwan\nand asked, \"Yushwan, we talked about the\narranged marriage last time. Your mother\nwould like to hear your thoughts again.\"\nUpon hearing the words arranged\nmarriage, Zhu Yushwan instinctively\nlowered her head, a blush rising on her\nfair face. Daughter, it is entirely up\nto your father and mother to decide.\nSeeing Zhu Yuswan's shy and bashful\nappearance, a smile flashed in Empress\nMa's eyes. After thinking about it, I\nfeel that it was still a bit too hasty.\nWhy don't I go and talk to your father?\nAt this point, Empress Ma deliberately\npaused for a moment, then carefully\nobserved Zhu Yuan&lt;unk&gt;s eyes. This\nmarriage, let's just not bestow it upon\nthem at all. No, no, mother. Upon\nhearing that the marriage would not be\narranged, Zhu Yusuan suddenly became\nanxious for some reason. Just as he was\nabout to get up, he found Empress Ma\nlooking at him with a smile in her eyes\nand a somewhat mocking expression.\nSeeing Empress Ma's expression, she\nunderstood that her mother was\ndeliberately teasing her. Just moments\nago, her face was only blushing, but now\nit's as red as if it's been pickled. It\ngives you the feeling that steam is\nrising from your head, and you might\nfaint at any moment. Seeing that Zuyu\nSchwan was so embarrassed that she was\nabout to bury her head, Empress Ma\nfinally spoke up. You silly girl, if you\nlike someone, why hide it? Why did your\nmother have to test you before you would\nsay it? Back then, your mother and\nfather weren't as shy as you are. Once\nyou've chosen someone, you should be\nopen and honest about it. With Empress\nMa's encouragement, Zhu Yushwan was no\nlonger as shy as before. However,\nlooking into Empress Ma's eyes, there\nwas still a hint of anxiety and\nuncertainty. Mother, I am determined to\nmarry no one but him. But since ancient\ntimes, mutual love is the rarest thing.\nHearing this, Empress Ma understood that\nthis silly girl was worried that Wayi Wu\ndidn't like her. Silly girl, do you even\nknow Wei Wu? Empress Ma originally\nintended to tell Zhu Yuan what we Wu had\nsaid to Zhu Yuan Jang, but after\nthinking about it, I still think it\nwould be better to let Zu Yuan hear it\nwith her own ears. In that case, let\nXiao Wu come to the inner palace\ntomorrow, and I, your mother, will help\nyou test his feelings. What do you\nthink? Chapter 95. Empress Ma, let's\nmeet my daughter, little one. sleeping\nsoundly. Wake up quickly and don't be a\nlaser bones. Get up and open a blind\nbox. After a good night's sleep, Wayi Wu\ngot out of bed early in the morning full\nof energy. Her voice, which had not been\nheard for a long time, rang out once\nagain with a loud and clear song. Even\nwhen reaching for clothes on the clothes\nrack, he couldn't stop talking. Little\nfriend, don't stay in bed. Quickly get\ndressed, stretch your legs, and bend\nyour back. You need to know this. Cough,\ncough, cough. After coughing twice to\ncover his embarrassment, Wayi Woo had\nalready put on his clothes. Just then,\nLeo walked in from outside the door\ncarrying a basin of water. Young master,\nyour bath water. No, I mean your washing\nwater. I've brought it for you. Leah\nfinished speaking haltingly, then put\ndown the basin of water and left the\nroom. Watching Leah's departing figure,\nwe wu stood there in silence for a long\ntime. She probably didn't hear me,\nright? After a moment of silence, Wayi\nWu had also finished mentally preparing\nhimself. Forget it. Shame is\nmeaningless. If you're shameless, you're\ninvincible. After washing up, Wayi Wu\nadjusted his mindset and came out of the\nroom. Every morning, several maids would\nprepare breakfast and place it on the\ncoffee table by the sofa. As Wayi Wu was\nabout to have breakfast after leaving\nthe room, he discovered that Shan Lin\nand Jean Hai were standing outside the\ndoor. Have you been here long? No. Oh\nno, young master. We just arrived. I\ndon't believe you for a second. You just\narrived. If you smirk, I'll believe you\njust got here. Wayu muttered a complaint\nin his heart, but his expression\nremained unchanged. Ahem. Um, what's the\nmatter? So early? Someone from the\npalace has come and said that her\nmajesty, the empress, wishes to see you\nand is waiting in the front courtyard.\nUpon hearing Shinllin's answer, Wayi Wu\ncouldn't help but feel a little puzzled.\nWhat's wrong with my aunt? She summoned\nme to the palace to see her so early in\nthe morning. He muttered himself. Then\nwe wu asked again, \"When did this\nhappen? Why didn't you wake me up?\"\nYoung master, her majesty, the empress\nsaid that you should not be disturbed\nwhile you are resting. We can inform you\nafter you have woken up. As soon as Shan\nfinished speaking, Wei Wu grinned. Look,\nlook, this is the love that comes from a\nloving ant. With a smug look on his\nface, we immediately led Shan Lin and\nthe other man to the front yard. As soon\nas he appeared, the imperial unic who\ndelivered the decree immediately came\nforward to greet him and pay his\nrespects. I have met the Earl of Chong.\nAll right, no need for formalities. Her\nmajesty the empress is waiting. By the\nway, next time you come, don't wait for\nme to wake up. Just announce your\narrival. Yes, Maki Changlu. The unic\nbowed his head and replied, then led Wei\nWu towards the palace. In order not to\nkeep Empress Maul waiting, Wayi Wu\ndeliberately quickened his pace on the\nway. To be honest, he's really looking\nforward to the elephant carriage. Zhu\nBao mentioned traveling and that would\nbe truly enjoyable. After a hurried\njourney, the two quickly entered the\nForbidden City and arrived at the\nCunning Palace. Although Weii Wu was\nonly a count, the Cunning Palace was his\nterritory which he could roam freely in.\nhere. Whether they are palace maids or\nunix, they will only bow to him and will\nnot stop him in the slightest. Waking up\nwas as easy as going home. I arrived at\nthe palace gate with ease. However,\nWayiu was stopped at the palace gate by\ntwo palace maids, even though he could\nusually enter at will. Upon seeing this,\nwe wu assumed that it was Empress Ma\ndoing her hair or something, and that it\nwas not appropriate for others to see\nher. So, he shouted something through\nthe gate. Auntie, I'm here. Xiao Wu is\nhere. Wait a moment. Annie will be ready\nsoon. After waiting outside the palace\ngate for less than a minute, Empress Ma\nslowly approached the gate. After\nleading Wei Wu into the hall before\nEmpress Ma could speak, Weii Wu spoke\nfirst. Aunt, next time you want to see\nme, don't make the palace servants wait\nfor me to wake up. How can a junior be\nso rude to his elders? E, it's nothing.\nI heard you were busy until very late\nyesterday, so I thought I'd let you get\nsome more sleep and rest. As they were\ntalking, the two had already sat down.\nAfter they were settled, Empress Ma said\nanother sentence. \"If your aunt really\nencounters any emergency, she will\ndefinitely have someone wake you up. By\nthe way, you haven't eaten breakfast\nyet.\" As she spoke, Empressma pointed to\nthe pastries beside her, and a palace\nmaid immediately stepped forward and\nbrought them to Wayi Woo. \"Have some\nsnacks to stave off your hunger first,\nand I'll have them prepare some food for\nyou later.\" Looking at the snacks in\nfront of him, Wayi Wu scratched his head\nand chuckled. He quite enjoyed the\nfeeling of being cared for by his\nelders. He had never actually tried the\npalace snacks before, so he didn't stand\non ceremony and just picked one up and\nstuffed into his mouth. However, while\neating, Wayiu did not forget his\nbusiness. By the way, auntie, is there\nsomething you want to see me about? Yes.\nI heard that your uncle Zu recently\ntalked to you about a marriage arranged\nby fate, but you refused. Upon hearing\nthat it was about a marriage decree,\nWayi Wu assumed that Empress Ma also had\nthis intention. After a moment's\nhesitation, and having carefully\norganized his thoughts, he began to\nspeak. Auntie, I did refuse, Uncle Zu.\nSpeaking of which, I also have something\nI want to tell you. I already have\nsomeone I love. So, could you please\ncancel this arranged marriage? Since it\nhasn't been announced to the public yet,\nwe can cancel it quietly without\naffecting the princess's reputation.\nEmperor's Ma looked at Weii Wu,\nsuppressing a smile, and asked him,\n\"Seriously, your uncle Zu and I are\nplanning to marry the most beautiful\nprincess to you. Aren't you afraid\nwe&lt;unk&gt;ll regret it later?\" \"He he\nAnnie, I made a bet with Uncle Zu back\nthen. If I regret it, I'll be a\ngrandson.\" After hearing what We Woo\nsaid, Emperor's Ma looked both amused\nand exasperated, shook her head, pointed\nat him, and said something. Yuyu, you\nreally made that bet unjustly. Now Wayiu\nwas also a little puzzled. No. What kind\nof person am I in their eyes? Am I the\nkind of person who gets lustful at first\nsight? Everyone thinks I regret it. Do\nyou think I, the second toughest man in\nthe Ming dynasty, would be a fickle and\nunreliable person. Weii Wu thought to\nhimself silently, but then he heard\nEmpress Ma's voice again. Since you say\nyou have someone you love, can you tell\nyour aunt who that person is? Upon\nWu immediately perked up. Actually, I\nwas just about to tell you, aunt, I want\nto marry you, Schwan, the maid you gave\nme. I love her, Clang. No sooner had the\nwords been spoken than some commotion\narose inside the palace. Weii Wu glanced\nat the location for which the sound\ncame, feeling somewhat puzzled. Even if\nEmpress Ma was kind and benevolent, if a\npalace maid spilled something, wouldn't\nshe have known to come and apologize\nimmediately? However, seeing that\nEmpress Ma had not spoken, he saw no\nneed to say anything more. And the most\nimportant thing now was Empress Ma's\nanswer. Just as Weii Wu was filled with\nanticipation, Empress Ma spoke with a\nsmile on her face. \"Since Yushuan has\nbeen given to you, she is yours now. How\ncould your aunt possibly separate you\ntwo, but there's something I need your\nhelp with?\" Wayi Wu immediately nodded.\nPlease speak. My daughter, she knows\nabout the arranged marriage and wants to\nmeet you. Ah, chapter 96. You You've\nreally put me in a terrible situation.\nWayu couldn't figure it out. No matter\nhow hard he tried, he just couldn't\nunderstand what was wrong with that\nprincess. He had already refused the\narranged marriage. Yet, she still wanted\nto see him one more time. What was she\ntrying to do? To be honest, Wayi Wu was\nsomewhat reluctant. What if this\nprincess is a spoiled and willful person\nand she's planning to call me over and\nbeat me up to vent her anger? If she\nreally does that, should I fight back?\nShould we emulate Gu Ai, the drunken\nwoman who beat the golden branch in the\nTang Dynasty and stage a scene of\nbeating up a Ming Princess in the\nForbidden City? I, Wayi Wu, am a\ndignified 8-ft tall man. How could I be\nbullied by a woman like her? However,\nmen who hit women are the most\ntasteless, and it's best not to do such\nthings. At worst, I'll just stay far\naway. if she shows any sign of making a\nmove, I'll run away as fast as I can.\nThinking of this, Wayi Wu nodded in\nagreement with his decision. He had\nbarely nodded when Empress Ma spoke up.\n\"Since you've agreed, I'll send someone\nto inform her and arrange for you to\nmeet later.\" After Empress Ma finished\nspeaking, Weii Wu was stunned for a\nmoment, and then he cursed himself in\nhis heart. \"We woo! We woo! You say\nyou're thinking, but why are you nodding\nnow? You can't escape it.\" Just as Weii\nWu was complaining, Empress Ma waved and\nsummoned a palace maid. Shiao Wu to stay\nwith Shiaoqing. She'll take you to the\nmeeting place. In this situation, Wei Wu\nwas at a loss and had no choice but to\nget up and bid farewell to Empress Ma.\nThen she left Cunning Palace with the\npalace made Shiao Ching. As he walked\nout of the palace gate, Wayi Wu\ndeliberately slowed his pace, hoping to\ndelay as long as possible. After taking\nonly two steps, he found himself\nstanding in front of the palace maid.\nLooking back, he saw that the palace\nmaid named Shiaoqing was walking even\nslower than him. Watching her gentle,\nlight steps, Wayi Wu couldn't help but\nsigh inwardly. What a kind person. No\nwonder she's a palace made serving her\naunt. Look at those tiny steps and that\nposture. She has the charm of a woman\nfrom Jang Nan. 5 minutes later, Wayi Wu\nlooked back at Cunning Palace, which was\nless than 200 meters away. Do all good\npeople walk this slowly? With his doubts\nin mind, Wayiu tried to take a couple of\nsteps, but then immediately gave up,\nturning her head to look at the other\npalace maids, and Unix, not far away,\nshe noticed that none of them were\nwalking in the same way as Shiaoqing.\nFive more minutes passed, but the palace\nmade Shiao Ching remained unhurried.\nSeeing this, Wayi Wiwu simply turned his\nattention to the system warehouse and\nprepared to open today's packages. He\ndidn't bother choosing from the three\npackages hanging in the air and simply\nopened the one on the right. Then a\nyellow and black object that looked like\na pistol appeared in front of us. The\ngun has 10 small holes at the front like\na honeycomb and a line of English\nletters and numbers is printed on the\nside of the gun. Taser 10. Taylor 10.\nIsn't that a stun gun? and it can fire\n10 shots in a row with a range of nearly\n14 meters. Did the system give me this\nthing at this time because it knew what\nI was going to face and wanted it to be\nfor self-defense. Thinking this to\nhimself, we woos lips curled into a\nsmile. This stuff is great. If that\nunruly princess dares to cause trouble\nlater, I won't have to worry about\nrunning away. Use this thing on her. let\nher experience that uncontrollable\ntingling and trembling sensation\nthroughout her body. Thinking of this,\nWayiu wished he could just take out the\nstun gun and play with it. But at that\nmoment, the palace maid who was leading\nthe way suddenly turned around and led\nhim through the archway next to her. My\nlord, I have brought you here. I must\nreturn to report to her majesty the\nempress. After saying this, the palace\nmade bowed to wei Wu and then turned and\nleft. Watching her departing figure, we\nwu was filled with questions. This girl\nis lucky to be with Empress Ma.\nOtherwise, she would probably have been\nbeaten to death. After muttering a\ncomplaint to himself, Wu shook his head\nand turned to examine his surroundings.\nAt first, Wayi Wu thought this was a\ngarden, but upon closer inspection, he\nrealized that what was planted in the\nground was not flowers at all. This is\nactually a vegetable garden. This\nprincess's tastes are rather simple and\nunpretentious.\nNo wonder she's old Jews daughter, just\nlike her father. Seeing the plants\ngrowing vigorously in the field, Wei Wu\nremembered something. It is said that\nwhen Zu Yuan Jang founded the country,\nthere was no space reserved for a garden\nin the palace. Just out of hobby, he\nturned a small open space behind the\npalace into a vegetable garden and\noccasionally grows some vegetables\nhimself. If nothing unexpected happens,\nthis should be the place we are in now.\nAs he sighed inwardly, Wayi Wu looked up\ninto the distance and saw a figure\nstanding in the middle of the vegetable\ngarden, dressed in a white and gold\ngown. Her graceful figure was still\nevident even though she had her back to\nWei Woo. She stood quietly in the middle\nof the vegetable garden. And just by\nstanding there, she gave people a\nfeeling of gentle tenderness. Strangely,\nwe woo had never seen her before. Yet he\nhad a strange feeling of familiarity\nwith her. The pretty figure standing\nthere stiffened upon hearing the noise\nbehind her. With doubts in his heart,\nWei Wu slowly walked over, but the\ncloser he got, the stronger the feeling\nbecame. Even so, he still stopped at a\nsafe distance of about 10 m. Weii Wu,\nthe Earl of Chong Lu, pays his respects\nto the princess. As Weii Wu&lt;unk&gt;s voice\nrang out, the princess standing in front\ntrembled slightly. At this moment,\nhowever, she did not know how to respond\nto Wayi Wu and could not utter a single\nword for a long time. Seeing that she\ndid not respond to him, Wayiu assumed\nthat the princess was angry. After all,\nwomen in ancient times were sensitive,\nand it was normal for them to feel\nemotional when they learned that they\nhad been rejected in marriage. Even in\nlater generations, couples still argue\nabout who dumped whom when they break\nup. After thinking about it, Wayi Wu\nfelt that he should explain himself as a\nway of giving an explanation. Princess,\nregarding his majesty's bestow of\nmarriage, I would like to say that\nrefusing this matter is not out of any\nintention to humiliate you. But I\nalready have someone in my heart, even\nif she is of lowly status. I do not want\nher to be a concubine. She can only be\nmy wife.\" Upon hearing these heartfelt\nwords, the princess standing in front\ntrembled slightly. Seeing this, Wayi Wu\nthought the other party was even\nangrier. But he still continued to\nspeak. If I do not refuse the arranged\nmarriage, even if the princess marries\nme in the future, it will only be in\nname only, and the couple will not be of\none mind. I'm sure the princess wouldn't\nwant to spend the rest of her life like\nthis, and neither would I. So, refusing\nthe arranged marriage is a good thing\nfor both of us. Wayi Wu stopped there\nbecause he had already said what was on\nhis mind. Whether the other party can\naccept it is not something he should\nconsider. In any case, when it comes to\nmarriage, Wei Wu will only marry someone\nhe likes and will not consider anyone\nelse. He felt something was strange\nthough. He had said so much, yet the\nprincess hadn't replied to a single\nword. Even if you have grievances or\nresentment, you should speak up. What\ndoes it mean to remain silent? Just as\nWeii Wu frowned in displeasure, the\nprincess, who had been silent all along,\nfinally turned around. Zhu Yusuan looked\nat Wayi Wu. Her eyes filled with\ntenderness and tears welled up and slid\ndown her cheeks. Young master, in this\nlife, Yusian only wishes to marry you\nand be your wife. Wayi Wu stood there\nblankly, staring at Juyusan's pretty\nface, which was stre with tears. Coming\nto my senses, I saw him suddenly slap\nhis thigh and say with a bitter and\nresentful expression, \"You\nyou've really put me in a terrible\nsituation.\" Chapter 97. Even when acting\nlike a grandson, he's so arrogant. Upon\nseeing that the princess was actually\nZhu Yuwan, we wu suddenly understood.\nIt's obvious without even guessing that\nshe was the one who caused the commotion\nin Cunning Palace. At the same time,\nWayi Wu finally understood why Empress\nMa and Emperor Zu both told him not to\nregret it. He really regretted it, but\nit's too late now. Old Ju, you old\ngeyser, you're so wicked, you're\npractically oozing rottness. You, you\nold scoundrel, you actually set me up.\nWayu was internally ranting about Zu\nYuanzong. Zuyu Schwan, upon hearing\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s words, froze on the spot,\nunsure how to respond. After a long\nwhile, she finally spoke pitifully.\nYoung master, Yusian didn't want to hide\nit from you. That night, when we were\nadmiring the moon, Yusian wanted to tell\nyou the truth, but I was interrupted.\nUpon hearing Zhu Yusuan say this, Wayi\nWu immediately recalled what happened on\nhis birthday night. It seems that Zhu\nYusuan was about to call his name, but\nhe was interrupted by asking about the\ntime. Hey, Yushuan, when you asked me\nabout the fate of the Ming princess, I\nwas about to say the fourth one. when\nyou interrupted me. Could it be that you\nare the third princess? Zhuan nodded.\nYes, I am father's third daughter which\nshould be the princess chon you\nmentioned. Are you angry with me? After\nspeaking, Zhuan looked at wei Wu with\nsome worry, afraid that he would be\nangry because she had concealed her\nidentity. However, the truth is that we\nwu angry at all. In fact, he was quite\nhappy. The reason I said I was badly\ntricked was mainly because I regretted\nspeaking too arrogantly to Zhu Yuan\nJang. As for why he was happy, is that\neven a question? This is Princess\nChonging. Given her personality, I doubt\nany man could refuse her. A princess who\nis willing to give up wealth and honor\nand share joys and sorrows with her\nhusband. Such a woman is a treasure in\nany era. Silly girl, how could I be\nangry? I am a joy. As he spoke, Wayi Wu\nreached out, instinctively wanting to\nstroke Zhu Yuwan&lt;unk&gt;s head. He stopped\nwhen he had only extended his hand\nhalfway because she suddenly remembered\nthat this was the imperial palace and\nthat Zhu Yushwan was no longer a maid.\nBut at that moment, Zhu Yuswan suddenly\nstuck her little head under his palm. I\nlike it when you touch my hair, young\nmaster. Haha. Upon seeing Zhu Yusu&lt;unk&gt;s\nreaction, Wayi Wu immediately burst into\nlaughter. He gently stroked the top of\nher head, then asked another question.\nYusen, why did you think of disguising\nyourself as a maid to come to my house?\nUpon hearing this, Zhuan covered her\nmouth and chuckled, a laugh that truly\ntouched Wayi Wu&lt;unk&gt;s heart. As the\nsaying goes, \"Beauty is in the eye of\nthe beholder.\" And Zhuwan was dressed up\nin a glamorous outfit today. It truly\nlives up to that line from the song of\neverlasting regret. The beauties of the\nsix palaces pale in comparison. Just as\nwe was lost in thought, Zhuwan spoke up.\nThis was not my idea. When my mother\nmentioned the arranged marriage to me, I\nknew in my heart that I had no choice.\nLater, my mother felt sorry for me and\nasked me if I wanted to meet you first.\nI also wanted to know what kind of\nperson I would marry. As Zhu Yuan\nfinished speaking, she subconsciously\nlooked at Wayi Wu only to find that he\nwas also looking at her. When their eyes\nmet, Zhu Yuwan still gazed at him with\naffection, while Wei Woo seemed a little\nshy. It can only be said that this is\nall the fault of being a lifelong\nsingle. Anyone with a bit of experience\nknows that while you can't push it over\nat this point, taking a couple of bites\nis still fine. Why did Ju Yuwan suddenly\nbecome more generous than Wei Woo?\nBecause she understood wei Wu's\nintentions. At the same time, she firmly\nbelieved that she would marry no one but\nhim, which is why this change occurred.\nSeeing wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s somewhat restrained\ndemeanor, Zhu Yuswan suddenly stepped\nforward. It was this attitude that made\nWei Wu understand what he should do.\nWithout any hesitation, he opened his\narms and hugged Zhu Yuswan tightly.\nAfter a long while, the two separated\nand Zhu Yusuan became that shy little\ngirl again, covering her cheeks. Weii Wu\nalso returned to his usual shameless\nstate. After a while, when both of them\nhad calmed down, Zhu Yuan slowly spoke.\n\"Young master, what you just did? Yian,\nyou used to pretend to be a maid, but\nnow you're princess. It's not\nappropriate for you to still call me\nyoung master.\" Before Zhuan could finish\nspeaking, Wei Wu interrupted her.\nHowever, Zhuan gave her own answer to\nWeii Wu&lt;unk&gt;s statement. But I really\nlike calling you young master. We can\nchange it to something else in the\nfuture. Hearing Zhu Yuwan say this way\ndidn't dwell on it anymore. After all,\nshe was his woman. Okay. By the way,\nwhat did you want to ask me? I want to\nask why just now, young master, you said\nI've really screwed you over. Upon\nhearing this, we immediately pictured\nZhu Yuan Jang&lt;unk&gt;s hateful face. Yuwan,\nit was your father who tricked me. From\nnow on, you'll call him father emperor,\nand I'll have to call him grandpa. Huh?\nZu Yushwan racked his brains trying to\nfigure out what we wound meant by those\nwords, but he still couldn't understand\nthem. It's all right. I'll talk to your\ndad about it later. By the way, are you\nstill coming back to my place? Seeing\nZhuwan's bewildered expression, Wayi Wu\ndidn't want to explain further and\ncasually changed the subject. Zuwan also\nlonged to go back, but he truly could\nnot return to Wayi Wu&lt;unk&gt;s side. Now,\nthe Empress Daer said that since we've\nreturned, we should stay in the palace\nuntil the day of our wedding. That's\ntrue. After all, you returned to your\nprincess status now, and people would\ngossip if you stayed with me. Although\nWeii Wu understood, he was very\nreluctant to part with her. Newly\nconfirmed couples if they are truly in\nlove, who wouldn't want to be together\neveryday and bear to be apart. With this\nin mind, Wayi Wu made up his mind to\nhave a good talk with old Jew later. If\npossible, set a wedding date as soon as\npossible and bring your wife home. Now,\nsince there was still some time, Wayi Wu\nthought the two of them could go for a\nstroll together. Looking at the\nvegetable gardens around him, he felt\nsomewhat helpless. Such a romantic\nencounter and confession took place in\nsuch a simple and unadorned vegetable\ngarden. Fortunately, what matters is not\nthe environment, but who is standing\nnext to you. The two then chatted as\nthey strolled around the vegetable\ngarden. It wasn't until Empress Ma sent\na palace made to deliver a message that\nZhu Yuwan reluctantly parted ways with\nWeii Wu. After leaving the vegetable\ngarden, Wayi Wu immediately stroed\ntowards the function hall. As if\nguessing that we wu would come, a unic\nwas already standing at the door of\nFunction Hall. Upon seeing Weii Wu\narrive, the unic immediately came\nforward to greet him. Lord Chonglu, his\nmajesty instructed me to wait for you\nhere. Please follow me. led by the unic.\nThe two arrived together at the rear\nhall of function hall. As soon as he\nentered the gate, Weii Wu saw that Ju\nYuan Jong&lt;unk&gt;s expression was somewhat\nambiguous, as if he were smiling, but\nnot smiling. After the unic who had led\nthe way left, we wu stood there in\nsilence for a long time. Then he stroed\nconfidently and walked up to Zhu Yuan\nJang with his head held high. Without\nany shame or fear, he raised his head\nand said loudly, \"Grandpa, I regret it.\"\nThat's right. Lord Wei is just that\narrogant. Chapter 98. First line. Regain\nyour former glory. Second line, hold\nyour head high. Horizontal scroll. Love\nflows like a tide. This completely\nunconventional move left Zhu Yuan Jang\nbewildered. This brat, he calls me\ngrandpa with such confidence. It feels\nlike I'm the one who lost. Not him. Just\nas Zu Yuan Jang was in a days, Wayi\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s voice rang in his ears again. I\nadmit it. I used to speak a bit louder\nand more assertive. But I've changed\nnow. Upon hearing Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s voice,\nZhu Yuan Jan finally came to his senses.\nChanged? Tell us what you've changed\ninto matured. Really? How ripe is it?\nLet me suffer a little longer, and I\nreckon it'll be fully cooked by now.\nUpon hearing Zhu Yuan Jang&lt;unk&gt;s teasing\nresponse, Wayi Wu replied with a\nhelpless sigh. Seeing his expression,\nZhu Yuan Jang burst in a laughter again\nand then continued to tease him. You\nbrat, weren't you pretty arrogant\nbefore? The second toughest man in the\nMing dynasty. Let's see if you can be\narrogant again. Uncle Zu, that's not\nvery kind of you. You set me up. That's\nwhy I said those words. After Wei Wu\nfinished speaking, Zhu Yuan Jang laughed\ntriumphantly. We told you beforehand\nthat we were going to marry our daughter\nto you, but you righteously refused. But\nyou never said your daughter was you,\nSchwan. I don't believe you didn't know\nabout this. Wayu got angry when this was\nmentioned. You and brotherh both came in\nmy house, which means you're working\ntogether to set a trap for me. Zu Yuan\nJang shook his head and said earnestly,\n\"You can't say that. You know, Yushuan\nwas arranged by your aunt Bower and I\ncan't tell anyone really. Okay, I'll go\nfind my aunt right now and complain that\nyou made me call you grandpa, making me\na generation above her for no reason. As\nhe spoke, Wayi Wu immediately turned\naround, looking agrieved as if he was\nabout to complain. Just then, Zhu Yuan\nJang suddenly called him to a stop. Come\nback here, you brat. Why are you always\ntrying to tattle on us? Aren't you\nashamed? Also, when did we ever ask you\nto call me grandpa? You clearly called\nme grandpa the moment you came in and\nyou did it so confidently. Upon hearing\nthis way turned his head and raised it\nhigh. That's my own aunt. It would be\nfoolish not to use someone who has a\npowerful backer. Speak. What do you\nwant? Bestowed marriage. An arranged\nmarriage isn't out of the question.\nHowever, I better go and tell on them.\nAll right. All right. You brat. Come\nback here right now. Seeing that way Woo\nwas about to run away again. Zhu Yuan\nJang didn't keep him in suspense and\nagreed on the spot. Upon hearing this,\nWayi Wu darted to Zhu Yu and Jang&lt;unk&gt;s\nside with a whoosh. Uncle Zu, when do\nyou think would be a good time? I think\ntomorrow is a good day suitable for\ngetting married, having a wedding night,\nand having a child. Hey, how come we\nnever noticed before that you, you\nshameless brat, are so brat? Then you\nshould have married your daughter to me\nearlier. If you had, you would have\nfound out much sooner. After Wei Wu\nfinished speaking, Zhu Yuan Jang glared\nat him irritably. Don't even think about\nit. Yusuan is our daughter. After all,\neven an emperor wouldn't marry off a\nprincess without preparation. You can't\njust let her get married whenever you\nwant. For royal weddings, the Imperial\nClan Court and the Ministry of Rights\nneed to make preparations according to\nregulations, and there are specific\nrules for choosing the date and time.\nWayi Wu was certainly aware of what Juu\nYuan Jang was saying. He was just\nputting on a show. After all, he's his\nfather-in-law, so it's only right that\nhe shows Zhu Yusuan respect. After some\nplayful banter, Zhu Yuan Jang stopped\narguing with Wei Wu about the marriage\nand instead asked about other matters.\nShiao Wu, your building is all\nrenovated, but the style is a bit\nstrange. What kind of business do you\nplan to do with it? Huh? The renovation\nis finished? I didn't even know. How did\nyou find out first? Zu Yuan Jang pointed\nto the floor. You came to the palace\nvery early this morning. The person who\nwas supposed to notify you couldn't get\nin. You'll find out when you get back.\nLet's talk about that. Hi Chow Shanglu.\nHi Chong you mentioned. What is it for?\nWhy is the name so weird? Literally\nspeaking, it should be called Azure Sea\nTide Rises. So why did you use Beep as\nthe first character? Weii Wu was still\nhappy, thinking that once the shop was\nrenovated, the little blue tablets could\nbe officially put on the shelves.\nUnexpectedly, Zhu Yuan Jang asked this\nquestion, leaving him speechless for a\nmoment. I named myself by Xiao Shang,\nmeaning by Chaos Shang, but but to avoid\nsome unforeseen circumstances. Yes. It\ndoesn't have any special meaning. Oh, is\nthat so? Zhu Yuan Jang looked at Wei Wu\nwith suspicion, his eyes full of\ndisbelief. Of course, another reason I\nwanted to name it coin sea tide is to\nimply that wealth will flow into my\npocket like the tide. I was just worried\nthat using the word coin would be too\ncommercial. So, I changed it to beep,\nwhich is considered more auspicious.\nLook, the character by is a combination\nof co mouth and by which means that\nmoney will come like a tidal wave\nwithout you having to speak. Yes, that's\nright. That's exactly it. At first,\nWayiui was just making things up, but as\nhe spoke, he felt he was getting more\nand more fluent. Then, without realizing\nit, the meaning of the four characters\nby Hi Chowo Shang was actually made\ncomplete. Even he himself didn't expect\nthat he would feel a little proud. But\nas soon as he finished speaking, he saw\nZhu Yuan Jang squinting at him. Then,\nwhat does the couplet hanging outside\nthe high Xiao building mean? The first\nline is regain your former glory. And\nthe second line is, \"Hold your head high\nand be a decent human being.\" All right.\nAnd there's that horizontal scroll. Love\nis like a tide. That scroll doesn't\nmatch your couple at all. Tell me\nhonestly, what exactly does your shop\ndo? It doesn't sound like a legitimate\nbusiness to us. Is it really that\nexplicit? I feel like I've been as\nsubtle as possible. Old Ju was able to\nnotice all of this. It seems he's not a\nsimple person after all. After pondering\nfor a while, Wayi Wu raised his head and\nlooked at Zu Yuan Jang. Actually, my\nshop sells tonics, mainly to make blood\nand chi more active and make people look\nyounger. This is a wonderful thing. It\ncan not only make men strong and viral,\nbut also make women tender and gentle.\nZu Yuan Jang glanced at Wei Wu\nsuspiciously, but judging from his\nexpression, he didn't seem to be lying.\nAfter confirming that Wayi Wu was not\nmaking things up, Zhu Yuan Jang was\nimmediately displeased. You little\nrascal, why didn't you bring this good\nstuff out sooner? Your aunt is weak.\nIt's perfect for nourishing her. Uncle\nAjou, actually, it's not that I don't\nwant to take this out. It's just that\nit's not suitable for women. You're just\ntalking nonsense. Didn't you just say\nthat men who eat it will become powerful\nand strong, and women who eat it will\nbecome gentle and tender? Having come\nthis far, Wayi Wu really couldn't\ncontinue making things up and could only\ntell the truth. Uncle Zu Waja said was\nthat it can make men strong and powerful\nand also make women gentle and tender.\nAfter speaking, seeing that Zhu Yuan\nJang remained silent, weii Wu assumed\nthat he had not understood and explained\nin more detail. What I mean is that\nafter a man eats it, he can make a woman\ntender and gentle. Do you understand\nnow? In fact, Waywood made his point so\nclear. How could Juu Yuan Jang, being a\nman, not understand? His silence wasn't\nbecause he didn't understand, but\nbecause he was pondering a deeper\nquestion. How could he express his\nmeaning without saying a word, making\nWei Wu understand. He really wants it.\nChapter 99. The White Lotus sect\nappears. Leaf Foam is targeted. While\nfeeling troubled, Zhu Yuan Jang also\nharbored some dissatisfaction with Wei\nWu. this brat. Even if we didn't say\nanything, you can't pretend you didn't\nknow. Where did your cleverness go? Why\nis your quick gone now? And so with Zhu\nYu and Jang silence, the entire rear\nhall of Funian Hall fell silent. Neither\nWei Wu nor he spoke. They simply looked\nat each other in silence, creating an\neerie harmony. After a long stalemate,\nWayi Wu suddenly realized something.\nThis state of wanting to speak but\nholding back, trying to cover it up is\njust like that of my good friend back\nthen. I really wanted to go to the\npharmacy to buy a box to try it out, but\nI just couldn't bring myself to do it.\nUm, Uncle Zu, would you like one? Why\nwould I need this? I am an emperor on\nhorseback. Although I am old, I am still\nvigorous and powerful. Oh, okay then.\nI'll head back now. Okay, go ahead. Upon\nhearing Zu Yu and Jang&lt;unk&gt;s answer,\nWayi Wu was quite surprised. This old\nman was really something else. Filled\nwith admiration for old Jews vigorous\nand powerful spirit. Weii Wu turned\naround and prepared to go back. However,\njust as he turned around, he suddenly\nheard Old Jews voice behind him.\nHowever, your elder brother does have\nsome unspeakable difficulties. Unlike\nus, he doesn't go to the battlefield to\nfight the enemy. Now, his body is a bit\nweak. If your medicine is truly\neffective, you might as well keep a few\npills and have someone send them to\nBower later. After old Jew finished\nspeaking, Wayi Wu immediately stopped\nand slowly turned around to look at him\nwith a half smile. That old man is\nreally something. I was just saying I\nhave a friend and you actually dragged\nyour own son into the mess to take the\nblame. What a true father. Wayi Wu\ninwardly complained, but found that Zhu\nYuan Jang&lt;unk&gt;s expression did not\nchange at all. His calm demeanor made it\nseem as if he was genuinely just asking\nfor it on behalf of Zu Bao. It has to be\nsaid that the shamelessness of someone\nwho can become emperor is truly beyond\nthat of ordinary people. Since Zhu Yuan\nJang had already spoken up, Wayi Wu\nnaturally wouldn't expose him. After\nall, even emperors care about their\nreputation. He turned around, took out\nthe medicine box from his pocket, opened\nit, and took out the two blister packs\nof hard aluminum foil inside. Weii Wu\nplaced one of the boards on old Zu&lt;unk&gt;s\ndesk and then gave him another\ninstruction. Uncle Zu, this medicine is\nindeed very effective, but it's only\ngood for amusement. You can't eat it as\nfood. Please tell brother Zu that you\nshould only take one or two pills at a\ntime. Take them with water and they\nshould take effect in about an incense\nsticks time. The effects of the medicine\nlast for about 2 to 3 hours. It's fine\nto try it occasionally, but if you take\nit too often, you will become dependent\non it. Remember, you must tell brother\nZhu that even though the night is\nwonderful, you must not indulge in\npleasure. After saying that, he noticed\nthat Zhu Yuan Jang&lt;unk&gt;s old face was\nstarting to show signs of strain.\nWithout the slightest hesitation, Weii\nWu turned around and stroed out of\nFunian Hall. As soon as I entered the\npalace and returned home, the steward\ncame looking for me. Young master, the\nBehi Chaosing Building has been\nrenovated according to your\nrequirements. Would you like to open it?\nWhy pick a day for starting a business?\nOf course, we'll open today. By the way,\nhave you recruited everyone yet? The\nmanager nodded immediately. We found the\nright young master as you requested.\nThey have long legs and slim waists. We\npicked two girls from the 14th floor and\nbought them back after redeeming them\nfrom their servitude. The black socks\nyou gave them have been put on and\nthey're waiting at the Beehive Chowing\nbuilding. Now, upon hearing this, Wayi\nWoo immediately perked up. Ancient\ncostumes paired with black stockings.\nThis is an extremely seductive\ncombination, and this time we can\nfinally see a liveaction version. This\nis something a respectable woman would\ndefinitely not wear in public, but it's\ndifferent for a cortisan. Anyway, the\nthin gauze they wore in brothel wasn't\nmuch less transparent than black\nstockings. Thinking of this, Wayi Wu\nwaved his hand and immediately led his\nguards out. Meanwhile, just as way Wu\nwas heading to the Chinuai River at\nZuao's signal, Leaf Fong, accompanied by\nfour palace servants, drove an\nelephantdrawn carriage out of the palace\ngate. This elephantd drawn carriage was\na gift from Zhu Bao to Chow Chow. In\nreality, it was Zhu Bao's own personal\nvehicle. He only slightly modified and\nremoved some non-compliant decorations\nbefore ordering Leaf Fong to send to Wu.\nOtherwise, building an elephant chariot\nwould not be something that could be\ndone in a day or two. It would take at\nleast 6 months. After exiting the palace\ngates, the imperial carriage traveled\nalong the wide main road of the capital.\nWayi Wu&lt;unk&gt;s residence was not far from\nthe palace. Leong and his group walked\nthere in the time it takes to drink a\ncup of tea. This time, Leon was ordered\nto leave the palace, and his only task\nwas to deliver the imperial carriage to\nChow Chow. There was no imperial decree\nto announce. Therefore, after delivering\nthe elephant carriage and learning that\nwe woo was not in the mansion, Leong did\nnot linger any longer. He didn't even\nwait for Wei Woo to return and hand the\nelephant carriage over to the servants\nin the mansion before leaving with his\nmen. Knowing Weii Wu&lt;unk&gt;s position in\nthe crown prince's heart, Leong also\nwanted to cultivate a good relationship\nwith Wei Wu. If we woo were home, he\ncould have taken the opportunity to\nexpress goodwill. But unfortunately,\nWeii Wu was not there. However, he could\nnot deliberately linger at Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s\nresidence as that would be too\nconspicuous and he also had to return to\nthe palace to report back. After leaving\nthe Wayi residence, Leong led the palace\nservants back the way they came, wanting\nto return to the palace as soon as\npossible to report back. However, as he\npassed a street corner, he suddenly\nfrowned and sensed something was wrong.\nJust as he realized what was happening\nand was about to warn the palace\nservants to be careful, several\nwhooshing sounds came from behind.\nWhoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Just as Leonai\nwas about to react, all four palace\nservants beside him had already fallen\nto the ground and died. Fourth throwing\nknives were pierced with incredible\nprecision between the eyebrows of the\nfour palace servants, demonstrating the\nruthlessness of the person who threw\nthem. Upon seeing this, a look of\nseriousness flashed in Lee Fang's eyes.\nHe could kill four people in one strike,\nbut his technique wasn't as precise.\nMoreover, judging from the other party's\nintentions, it was clear that they were\ntargeting him. Otherwise, there should\nhave been five throwing knives instead\nof killing four people and leaving only\nhim alive. Realizing this, Leong\nimmediately turned to look in the\ndirection for which the flying knife had\ncome. A person with a mask on, dressed\nin coarse linen clothes, stood in the\nalley, coldly watching him. The moment\ntheir eyes met, the masked man turned\nand ran into the alley. A cold glint\nflashed in Leang's eyes, and without\nsaying a word, he chased after them. The\ntwo chased each other for about a minute\nbefore the masked man stopped in a\nsecluded dead-end alley. Reaching the\nalley entrance, Leong stared intently at\nhis opponent as he slowly walked over.\nSince you've gone to all this trouble to\nbring me here, shouldn't you at least\nreveal your true colors? The mass man\nflicked his wrist and three throwing\nknives shot out from his sleeve. This\nwas his way of answering Leo.\nUnfortunately, because Leo was prepared,\nthe three throwing knives had no effect\nwhatsoever. Seeing this, the mass man\nfinally spoke his first words. The white\nlotus descends to earth. The cycle of\nheavenly principles continues. The\neternal mother, the true homeland,\nimmeasurable life, eternal youth. Upon\nhearing the scriptures spoken by the\nmasked man, Leong seemed to be\nfrightened and turned to run away. As\nsoon as he turned around, Lee Fang's\nentire body began to tremble. Up was\nsomeone was approaching. How come I\ndidn't notice at all? Chapter 100. Leaf\nfoam. If I die, none of you will get\naway with it. Why was Leaf Foam so\nfrightened? because when he turned\naround, he saw that there was a burly\nand strong man standing behind him. Of\ncourse, it wasn't this man who scared\nhim and he didn't even know this person.\nWhat truly terrifiedly phone was that\ndespite his keen awareness, he hadn't\nnoticed how the person had gotten so\nclose. It appeared suddenly behind him\nlike a ghost. If this person hadn't\nrefrained from making a move, he\nprobably would have died without even\nknowing why. Traderly foam. You betrayed\nthe holy church and disappeared without\na trace 10 years ago. I never expected\nyou to end up as a unic in the palace.\nAfter the towering man finished\nspeaking, he didn't give Leong a chance\nto speak and continued. This Dharma\nprotector has come to clean up the sect\non the orders of the master. If you know\nwhat's good for you, don't resist. In\nthat case, I can give you a quick death.\nUpon hearing this person claimed to be a\nprotector, a feeling of despair began to\nspread in Lefangs heart. Before he\nbetrayed the sect, even with his\nstrength, he couldn't get the position\nof protector. If this person in front of\nme is truly a protector of the dharma,\nthen he is doomed to die today. Just as\nLeon was anxiously wondering how to save\nhis life, the dharma protector spoke up\nagain. Surrender obediently. This\nprotector is very busy. After killing\nyou, I still need to kill that man named\nWei Wu before I can go back to report.\nLeong never expected to hear Weii\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s name at this time. Although he\ndidn't know why the White Lotus sect was\nlooking for Wei Wu, he thought it might\nbe an opportunity. Looking at the\ntowering, muscular man, Leong hesitated\nfor a moment before tentatively saying,\n\"Guardian, I am familiar with Wayi Wu.\nHe is not as simple as you think. His\nmethods are extremely unpredictable. I\ncan tell you about him. I only ask that\nyou give me a chance to return to the\nholy church and atone for my sins. Upon\nhearing Lee Fangs words, a hint of\ncontempt flashed in a protector's eyes.\nNo matter how cunning he is, he is\nnothing more than a child's trick in\nfront of this protector. As for you,\nanyone who betrays the holy church will\nbe punished. Consider yourself lucky.\nYou can go to your blissful homeland\nahead of time. The white lotus sex\ndoctrine states that as long as one\nbelieves in the eternal mother, one will\nbe guided to the void homeland after\ndeath. But this death cannot be a\nself-inflicted end to one's life, which\nis why the dharma protector said these\nwords. However, Leong didn't believe in\nthat nonsense about a vacuum hometown at\nall. Otherwise, he wouldn't have\nbetrayed his religion in the first\nplace. Hearing the words of the Dharma\nprotector, Leong understood that he\ncould not escape death today. But no\nmatter what, he was determined to give\nit his all and wouldn't surrender so\neasily. So just as the Dharma Protector\nfinished speaking, Leong suddenly swung\nhis right hand and a flash of cold light\nslashed towards the Dharma Protector's\nthroat. However, at the crucial moment,\nthe guardian simply lowered his head and\nactually used his clothes and chin to\ntrap the blade. What? How is this\npossible? As Leo was shocked, a sharp\niron all slid into his hand from his\nleft sleeve. He then thrust his spear\nforcefully toward the protector's heart.\nWhoosh! It moved so fast that it even\ncreated the sound of wind. However, this\nsureill move still failed to work, and\nthe sharp iron spike failed to pierce\nthe protector's body. Physical training\nhard. At this point, Lee Funkai finally\nunderstood what kind of opponent he had\nencountered. It was too late for him to\nrealize this now. The protector had\nknocked him out of the mouth with just\none punch. The force was so great that\nLeon was almost certain that his\ninternal organs had been destroyed.\nAfter getting up from the ground, Leon\nglanced at the wall beside him and\nwithout the slightest hesitation, he\nused all his strength to leap over it.\nWe definitely can't win in a fight, so\nthe only thing we can do now is try to\nescape. Unfortunately, just as he\nclimbed over the wall, a whooshing sound\ncame from the air. The next second, a\ntearing pain shot through his thigh, but\nLeo knew he couldn't stop. Despite the\npain in his leg, Leoong jumped off the\ncourtyard wall and crawled into the\nbuilding. By the time the two members of\nthe White Lotus sect climbed over the\nwall, Leong had already vanished. Snort.\nThe guardian snorted coldly and turned\nto look at the masked man. Was it\npoisoned? He's been poisoned. Leangs\ninternal organs are severely injured,\nand he's also been poisoned by me. He\nwon't last more than half a cup of tea\nbefore he succumbs to the poison and\ndies. Upon hearing the masked man's\nreply, the guardian slowly nodded, and\nthen the two disappeared from the wall.\nA cup of tea takes only about 6 or 7\nminutes, so it's no wonder the two of\nthem were so confident. After all, Leong\nsuffered severe internal injuries and\nwas also poisoned, making it impossible\nfor him to return to the palace.\nUnbeknownst to the two, Leong did not\nreturn to the palace, but instead came\nto Wayi Wu&lt;unk&gt;s residence. Under normal\ncircumstances, given Leang's current\nappearance, he would definitely be\nstopped by the embroidered uniform guard\nif he tried to approach Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s\nresidence. However, when Wei Wu went\nout, the Imperial guards responsible for\nprotecting him followed him out. This\ngave Leo the opportunity to climb over\nthe courtyard wall. Unfortunately, Leo\nwas already at his limit and was only\nholding on by his own willpower. As he\nclimbed over Wei Woos courtyard wall,\nhis willpower weakened and he fell\nstraight off the wall. Thump! Vomit! He\nhad already suffered internal organ\ninjuries, and the fall caused him to\nvomit blood on the spot. The blood,\nwhich should have been bright red, was\nnow a dark reddish brown. Upon seeing\nthis, Leo forced himself to turn his\nhead and glance at his thigh. Sure\nenough, the wound there was also black.\nCough, cough, cough, vomit. After\nvomiting another large amount of blood,\nLeong knew in his heart that he\nabsolutely could not survive. I I die\nand you all of you don't even think\nabout being better than cough vomit.\nLeong spoke venomously, panting heavily.\nthe intense dizziness in his mind almost\nmaking him unable to hold on any longer.\nEven so, he used his last bit of\nstrength to cut a piece of cloth from\nhis clothes. He dipped his finger in the\nblack filthy blood and wrote three words\non the cloth. White lotus in danger. I\noriginally intended to write about the\ndangers of the White Lotus sect, but\nafter writing the two characters, White\nLotus, Leo knew he couldn't possibly\nfinish writing it. Unfortunately, the\ncomplicated character for teach had to\nbe changed to the dangerous character\nfor danger. Even so, he couldn't finish\nwriting the character worry danger\nbefore his arm collapsed to the ground\nlifeless. It was only then that the\nservants in the house finally noticed\nhis presence. However, the guards and\nstewards of the household had all gone\nout with Wei Woo, and the servants did\nnot know what to do. In the end, they\nhad no choice but to call Leah over. As\nWayi Wu&lt;unk&gt;s personal maid, she had a\ncertain amount of power in the mansion.\nSeeing Leo lying on the ground, barely\nalive, Leah panicked. She recognized\nLeo. He was a unic serving the crown\nprince and had visited her home several\ntimes before. Now this person has\nsuddenly appeared in her home and looks\nlike he's about to die. How could she\nnot panic? Just as Leah was at a loss\nfor what to do, Leang's fingers twitched\nslightly. Upon seeing this, Leah quickly\nwalked over and happened to see the\npiece of cloth that Leon was pressing\ndown. Give it to Weii Weii. Leong, who\nwas already on his deathbed, died before\nhe could utter the word woo.\nFortunately, Leo was smart enough to\nunderstand what Leong was trying to say\nand grab the piece of cloth. Gather all\nthe male servants in the household and\nhave them all protect me as I head to\nthe Chinuai River to find the young\nmaster. Chapter 101. In the opening of\nthe Beehive Xiaoing building, the White\nLotus sect harbors deadly intentions.\nWhen Leah left with her servants, Wayiu\nhad already arrived at the Chinuai\nRiver. It must be admitted that\nthroughout history, wherever there is\nbeauty, there is always a lively place.\nAs the premier entertainment district of\nthe Ming Dynasty, the Chinuai River area\nwas incredibly bustling. Bihigh Chaosing\nBuilding is located on Shiuan North\nStreet inside Jaandong Gate opposite\nSuilo building. Jaong gate was an\nimportant waterway in the capital. So\nwas naturally a gathering place for\nmerchants with boats and carriages\ncoming and going and brothel and ends\nconverging in the city. The market was\nexquisite and clean with vendors\ncarrying baskets and hampers hawking\ntea, fruit and candy. Walking down the\nstreet, Wayiu could clearly feel the\ncrowds and the strong atmosphere of\neveryday life. Of course, the most\nattention-grabbing were the cortisans\nwho attracted all sorts of attention.\nPerhaps because they saw Wayi Woos\nluxurious clothes. These women kept\nthrowing him flirtatious glances. Some\nwere even bolder, not only waving at\nhim, but also deliberately showing off\ntheir fair shoulders in a provocative\nmanner. Brothel don't only operate at\nnight, they do business during the day\nas well. Unfortunately, these women are\noverthinking things. That little bit of\nfair white shoulder couldn't possibly\nstir his heart, which had been through\nthe baptism of a two terabytes hard\ndrive. After passing through the\nbustling streets, the group finally\narrived at the entrance of the Beehive\nChaosing Building. In terms of\nappearance, it is no different from the\nprevious Mayan building. still with a\nhigh base, double eaves, spacious and\nmagnificent. The only change is that the\nplaque above the door has been replaced\nand a couplet has been hung on each side\nof the door. However, they're all\ncovered by cloth now, so no one can see\nwhat the couplets say. However, Mayanlu\nis one of the 14 buildings along the\nChin Hawaii River, and its reopening has\nnaturally attracted much attention. so\nmuch so that when we woo arrived, there\nwere already quite a few people watching\nthe spectacle outside his beehive\nchowing building. Wayi Wu is after all a\ndignified earl. It wouldn't be good for\npeople to know that he is the\nbehindthe-scenes boss of the Beehive\nChowing building. So he led the guards\naround to the back door and when they\nsaw no one around, they pushed open the\ndoor and went inside. As he entered the\nlobby from the backyard, two shimmering\nsilky black pieces with a hint of white\nimmediately catch her eye. Wayi Wu\ncouldn't help but sigh inwardly.\nAwesome. The steward in the house was\nindeed not lying to him. And judging\nfrom the current situation, the steward\nwas quite capable. These two girls not\nonly had plump legs, but also well\nproportioned legs. Their legs looked\nlike they would outlive Jean Hai.\nMoreover, to match the black silk that\nWay Wu brought out, their skirts were\nspecially modified to be shorter.\nwearing this outfit. The men of the Ming\ndynasty would probably be furious just\nby looking at it. In fact, if it were\njust these two black silk stockings,\nWayi Wu would definitely not be willing\nto take them out. The real moment for\nblack stockings to shine will come when\nthey get married and enjoy the pleasures\nof their bedroom together. It's just\nthat the package way opened might have\nbeen ordered by some large Silkfoot\nmassage club. One package contained over\na 100 items in various colors and\nstyles. There were even two classic\nletter designs from certain family, but\nwe wu kept them for future use. Upon\nseeing Weii Wu arrive, the two girls\nimmediately came forward to greet him.\nOne of them had a round face and the\nother had an oval face. Both were quite\ngood-looking, above average. Boss. Boss.\nAfter glancing at the two girls long,\nsmooth legs, Weii Wu nodded in\nsatisfaction. What were your names?\nRoundfaced girl, my name is Yin Hong.\nThe girl with the oval face said, \"My\nname isQing Llu.\" \"Wow, these names\nreally do suit their professions.\" He\nsilently complained to himself. Then,\nWeii Wu pointed to their legs. \"Are you\nall comfortable wearing these\nstockings?\" Upon hearing Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s\nquestion, Yin Hong immediately ran her\nfingers lightly across her leg. \"It's so\ncomfortable. Even though I'm wearing it,\nit feels like I'm not wearing anything\nat all.\" Seeing this, Aoyagi was not to\nbe outdone and stretched his leg forward\nhalf a step. And it feels incredibly\nsmooth to the touch. Boss, would you\nlike to try it? No, I've already made it\nashore. So why am I still having these\noccupational hazard symptoms? We will\nremained remarkably calm and collected\nin the face of the two girls teasing. He\ncasually waved his hand and declined\ntheir invitation. All right, I won't try\nit. We'll be opening for business in a\nbit, so don't let anyone else try it.\nOkay, we're targeting the high-end\nmarket. Our guests are all high-ranking\nofficials and dignitaries. We need to be\nclassy, sophisticated, and impressive.\nRemember, you're just sales assistants.\nYou don't need to accompany customers or\ndo anything. Your responsibility is to\nguide customers to buy Mangan Gin Xiang\npills. Minglan Jin Xang Wan is the new\nname that we woo gave to the little blue\npills which would be described as very\nsimple and straightforward. But that's\nexactly the effect he wanted. And he\neven deliberately used blue text as a\nway of commemorating the world he once\nknew. After giving instructions to Yin\nHong and Chinlu, Weii Wu looked at the\nsteward. Have all the small porcelain\nbottles I order arrived? We've arrived.\nEverything's already in the warehouse.\nWayi Wu nodded and took out 20 small\nblue tablets from his pocket, handing\nthem to the steward. Manager Hong, here\n100 pills. Take out the medicine and put\nonly one pill in each porcelain bottle.\nThe store hasn't opened yet, and the\neffects and reputation of Manglan golden\ngun pills haven't spread. Moreover, its\nprice is high, and Weii Wu believes that\nhaving 200 of them in the store is more\nthan enough for now. After Steuart Huang\ntook the small blue card, Weii Wu\ncontinued, \"I've already told you the\nprice. From now on, you'll be the\nmanager of this shop and you can leave\nthe household affairs to Ching Xia.\"\nWeii Wu then had Shin Lllin leave four\nguards here to help. In case of any\ntroublemakers or hooligans, there will\nbe someone to stop them. After arranging\nthings at the shop, we wu led Shinllin\nand the other eight men out the back\ndoor. He doesn't plan to show up for the\nopening ceremony. He'll just check the\ncrowd later to make sure everything is\nall right. After exiting through the\nback door, Wayi Woo and his entourage\nfollowed the path to the main street.\nHowever, he just stood there at the\nintersection, intending to leave as soon\nas the store opened. Weii Wu was unaware\nthat he had been targeted the moment he\nemerged from the side path. In the\ncrowd, a burly man and a lean man were\nsubtly observing him. After confirming\nthat everything was correct, the lean\nman whispered to the burly man beside\nhim. the protector. It's him. I've been\nkeeping an eye on the mansion. This\nmorning, he was the only one who came\nout of the mansion and then went into\nthe palace. As he spoke, the lean man\nturned his head and looked around for a\nwhile. There are quite a few people\nhiding around him, probably protecting\nhim this way. Woo is no ordinary person,\nso it won't be easy for him to make a\nmove. It doesn't matter. He's just a\npiece of trash who needs someone to\nprotect him. The protector snorted\ncoldly, then continued speaking. We'll\nsplit up in a bit. You hide in the crowd\nand make your move secretly. If you can\ntake him down, that would be best. If we\nfail, we'll try to make a big commotion\nand lure away his men. Then, I'll kill\nhim myself. After the protector finished\nspeaking, the lean man nodded to\nindicate that he understood, but then\nadded something else. But I'm afraid I\nwon't be able to lure his guards away.\nIt's all right. As long as I'm not\nsurrounded by many people, killing Wei\nWoo will be as easy as taking candy from\na baby. Knowing the protector's\nabilities, the lean man said, \"No more.\"\nAnd disappeared into the crowd. At this\nmoment, the protector looked at way Woo\nagain, a cold smile on his lips. I am\nprotected by the divine power of the\neternal mother, and I am invulnerable to\nswords and spears. How could a few mere\nguards stop me? Chapter 1. O2 Woo! Your\ndeath is imminent. I will send you on\nyour way. Bang. The murderous intent\nlurking beneath the shadows did not\ndampen the liveless of Shiguan North\nStreet. Just as everyone was waiting to\nsee what would happen, the doors of the\nbeehive chaosing building were suddenly\nopened. Eat the Minglan golden gun pill.\nBecome the Xiao Zeong of the pleasure\nquarters. Seven in and seven out is not\na dream. Showing the might and valor of\na man. As soon as the gate opened,\nmanager Huang came out with Yan Hong\nandQing Lu and shouted loudly to the\ncrowd. It's worth mentioning that this\nsimple and straightforward opening\nimmediately stunned everyone. After a\nbrief silence, the onlookers actually\nstarted clapping. It's not surprising\nreally since there aren't that many\nliterati and scholars. The majority of\npeople in the world are always ordinary\npeople and ordinary people like this\nkind of vulgar but straightforward\nstuff. The applause proved their liking,\nbut also brought trouble to Wei Woo. The\nlean man had been hiding in the crowd,\nlooking for an opportunity, and this\nclapping gave him his chance. Taking\nadvantage of the applause from the\ncrowd, he quietly took out a blowpipe\nfrom his pocket. At the tip of the\nblowpipe, a black needle can be seen\nhidden inside, which must have been\ncoated with a deadly poison. Taking\nadvantage of the swaying hands and\nchaotic sound around him, the lean man\nquietly put the blowpipe into his mouth\nand aimed it at Wayi Woo. Because they\nwere hidden among the crowd, we\nwoo&lt;unk&gt;s guards and Imperial guards did\nnot notice anything unusual. Then the\nlean man pressed the tip of his tongue\nagainst the end of the blowpipe and took\na deep breath. Just as he was about to\nblow his breath and take Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s\nlife, a delicate shout suddenly rang out\nfrom the crowd at the crucial moment.\nYoung master, watch out. Is that Leah's\nvoice? Because the incident happened so\nsuddenly, we didn't know what Leah meant\nby being careful. However, since she was\nhis personal maid, Wayi Wu&lt;unk&gt;s trust\nin her was beyond question. Without the\nslightest hesitation, he immediately\nprepared to take out his riot shield to\nprotect himself. Although we don't know\nwhere the danger will come from, doing\nthis is definitely the safest option.\nShin Linn and the others who were\nstanding nearby heard Leah's reminder\nand immediately realized that they\nshould surround Wei Woo. But they were a\nstep too late because the lean man had\nalready made his move. A cold glint\nflashed in his eyes and a jet black\nneedle shot out from the blowpipe,\nheading straight for Wei Wu's throat.\nThe lean man was certain that his attack\nwould not miss. With the speed of the\nflying needles, the guards simply didn't\nhave time to block Wayi Woo. Once that\npoisoned flying needle pierces way\nWoo&lt;unk&gt;s throat, even a celestial being\nfrom the great Luo golden immortal realm\nwill not return. The lean man's idea was\nindeed correct. But he ultimately\nunderestimated Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s methods.\nJust when he thought he had succeeded,\nthe smug smile on his face suddenly\nfroze. How is this possible? When did\nthis shield appear? The seemingly\ncertain attack with flying needles was\nunexpectedly blocked by a shield that\nappeared out of nowhere. He couldn't\neven see where the shield came from. He\nonly saw his own flying needles fall to\nthe ground. The key is the guards around\nWei Woo and the people hiding around him\nto protect him. They all pinpointed his\ncurrent location by tracking the\ntrajectory of the flying needles. Seeing\nthis, the lean man didn't have time to\nthink it through and immediately turned\naround and disappeared into the crowd.\nIt must be said that this lean man is\nindeed quite capable. He is not only\nquick in his movements but also agile.\nHe was like a fish swimming in the\ncrowd, darting left and right without\nbeing hindered by the crowd at all.\nBecause of their large numbers, the\nleader of the embroidered uniform guards\nimmediately drew his sword and shouted\nin desperation. When an embroidered\nuniform guard is on duty, everyone must\nsquat down. Upon hearing that it was an\nofficial matter, the people\ninstinctively squatted down. The\nImperial guards then locked onto the\nlean man again, and a large number of\nmen quickly gave chase. At this moment,\nLeah finally made her way through the\ncrowd to Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s side. Young\nMaster, that was really dangerous. Just\nas Wei Wiu was about to ask, Shinllin\nspoke up first. Young Master, the\nassassin may have accompllices nearby.\nThere are many people outside, and we\ndon't know where an arrow might be shot\nfrom. Let's go back to the Behi\nChowashing building and hold our\nposition until the Imperial Guards send\nreinforcements. Once they have more men,\nthey can escort you back to your\nresidence. Wayi Wu understood that Shan\nLllin was right. So, he simply gave a\nbrief instruction, advanced by high tide\nrising building. After speaking,\nescorted by Shan Lin and others, the\ngroup pushed through the crowd and\nreturned to the Behi Chaosing Building.\nOnce he was sure it was safe for the\ntime being, we wu turned to Leah and\nasked, \"Leah, thank you for reminding me\nearlier. By the way, how did you end up\nhere?\" Upon hearing Wayi Wu&lt;unk&gt;s\nquestion, Leah did not hesitate and\nimmediately began to explain. Young\nmaster, something happened at home, so I\ncame to find you. But as soon as I\narrived, I saw that person trying to\nkill you. I didn't know what to do, so I\njust shouted to warn you to be careful.\nLuckily, you're all right. That was\nreally dangerous. Has something happened\nat home? Upon hearing this, we wu\nfrowned and immediately asked another\nquestion. You said something happened at\nhome. What happened? Young master,\nsomeone in the family has died. It was\nthat unic who came to our house before\nthe unic named Leaf foam. After saying\nthat, Leah reached into her bosom and\ntook out a piece of cloth, handing it to\nWayi Woo. We don't know how he got in.\nWhen we found him, he was on the verge\nof death, and this was all that was\nleft. Leaf Fong is dead and he died in\nmy yard. While Weii Wu was puzzled, he\ntook the piece of cloth from Leah and\nglanced at it. White lotus in danger.\nNormally, three words cannot convey much\ninformation, but these three words are\ndifferent. The mere combination of the\ncharacters white and lotus is already\nquite telling. It's likely related to\nthe White Lotus sect, and the addition\nof the word danger makes the meaning\nquite clear. The White Lotus sect is\ndangerous. Seeing that way, Wu remained\nsilent. Leah, who was standing next to\nhim, began to worry. Young master, had\nwe gotten ourselves into trouble? Leon\nwas his highness, the crown prince's\nman. Yet, he died in our house. This\nbefore Leah could finish speaking, Wei\nWu waved his hand. It's all right. Don't\nworry. After giving a casual reply, we\nturned his gaze back to the piece of\ncloth. If Leon was killed by the White\nLotus sect, what does it mean that he\ncame to my house even in his dying\nmoments? He was on his deathbed, yet he\nstill left me these three words. Was he\ntrying to tell me that the White Lotus\nsect had its eye on me? But what is Le\nFang's purpose in doing this? Is it a\nsudden repentance before his death? Or\ndoes he want to use me to take revenge?\nIt's quite normal for Weii Wu to have\nthis kind of speculation. After all,\nLeong had once tried to assassinate him\nand had suffered a great loss at his\nhands, almost losing his life. If he\nreally died at the hands of the White\nLotus sect and then learned that the\nWhite Lotus sect was targeting Wei Woo,\nthen his actions would make sense.\nHowever, thinking about this, we wu then\nrecalled what had just happened. Judging\nfrom this, the assassin outside just now\nmust have been someone sent by the White\nLotus sect to kill me. But I have no\ngrudge against those lunatics in the\nWhite Lotus cult, nor have I had any\ncontact with them. What is their purpose\nin killing me? Just as Weii Wu frowned\nin confusion, a burly figure appeared\nsilently in the hall. Before anyone\ncould notice, he spoke first. Weii Wu,\nyour death is imminent. I have come to\nsend you on your way. Chapter 103.\nI combine my true energy with the\ncreation of heaven and earth. And the\nthunder, God assists me. The sudden\nvoices immediately alerted everyone.\nLooking in the direction of the sound,\nthey saw a burly man as tall as an iron\ntower slowly walking out from the\ncorner. Upon seeing this person appear,\nShunlin and the others surrounding Wayi\nWu immediately drew their swords and\nstood guard. However, the burly man did\nnot take them seriously, his eyes filled\nwith contempt. A bunch of trash dare to\nbear their teeth. Today I will unleash a\nmassacre and kill you all. After making\na mocking remark, the burly man\nimmediately stroed towards Wei Wu.\nSeeing this, Shan was about to give the\norder to take action, but Wei Wu\nsuddenly spoke up. \"Hey, big guy, don't\nyou have a moment to chat before you\nstart?\" \"Trying to stall for time, huh?\nDo you think I'd fall for that?\" The\nburly man gave a casual reply, but his\nsteps did not falter. At this moment,\nWeii Wu spoke again. It's very simple. I\nhave two questions. First, did you kill\ne phone? Second, why do you want to kill\nme? Even if I'm going to die, at least\nlet me die knowing why, right? Besides,\ndidn't you even bother to announce your\nname before you killed someone? The\nburly man sneered. I did kill. As for\nthe other questions, I'll send you\ndownstairs to ask him. Having said all\nthat, we wu gave up on the idea of\ncontinuing to probe. Seeing that way, Wu\nwas no longer speaking, Shan Lin, who\nhad been anxious for a long time,\nhurriedly gave the order, \"Go kill him\nand protect the young master.\" Upon\nhearing the order, 10 guards immediately\ndrew their swords and rushed forward,\nwhile only Shinllin and Jean Hai\nremained still. However, the two of them\nwere also on high alert, guarding Wei\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s side. Soon, the guards who\nrushed out clashed with the burly man,\nand three of them swung their knives at\nhim. The others were also ready to step\nin if anything happened. However, facing\nthe blade, the burly man neither dodged\nnor avoided it, letting the long sword\nslash at him. The next second, the\nguards are all dumbfounded. Under their\nslashing blows, the burly man was\ncompletely unharmed. Although his\nclothes were somewhat torn, his skin\nunderneath was completely unharmed. Just\nas the guard were stunned, the burly man\nlaunched his counterattack. He grabbed a\nguard and swung him around like a meteor\nhammer. With just one move, he sent\nthree or four guards flying backward.\nThere were only 10 guards surrounding\nhim, which meant he took out half of\nthem in an instant. But this was just\nthe beginning. After dealing with those\nguards, the burly man hurled the guards\nat the other man. Unable to dodge in\ntime, he knocked down several more\npeople, leaving only one person\nstanding. Upon seeing this, the burly\nman burst into unrestrained laughter.\nHaha, you're all too weak. You're all\ntoo weak. I haven't even had my fill\nyet, and you're all already lying down.\nUnder my protective divine power, you\nare as weak as ants, and I can crush you\nwith a flick of my wrist. A protective\ndivine skill. Upon hearing this word, we\nwoo&lt;unk&gt;s lips curled into a cold smile.\nOnly the lunatics of the White Lotus\nsect could utter such stupid words. Why\nare they called insane? Because only\nthis word can describe what the White\nLotus sect did. During the Yuan dynasty,\nthey opposed the Yuan and sought to\nrestore the Song Dynasty. During the\nMing dynasty, they opposed the Ming and\nsought to restore the Yuan dynasty. And\nduring theQing dynasty, they opposed\ntheQing and sought to restore the Ming\ndynasty. They treated rebellion, a\nmatter that could cost them their lives,\nas a hobby and a lifelong career, and\nfought for it. No matter who comes to\npower, they will rebel. But they can't\neven come up with a decent banner. What\nelse could this be but a psychopath?\nLooking at the burly man who is beaming\nwith pride after displaying his might. A\ncold glint flashed in Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s eyes.\nFrom what you're saying, you're very\nbrave. What? You want to test your\nskills against me? Shunlin and Janghai,\nget out of the way. I want to see just\nhow powerful his protective divine skill\nreally is. After the burly man finished\nspeaking, Wei Wu reached out and pushed\nShinllin and Jean Hai, who were caught\noff guard, aside. Protective divine\nskill is it? Then I'll see if your\nprotective magic can stop my 11.43 mm\nbullet. With that in mind, Wayi Wu\nprepared to take the M1911 from the\nwarehouse. But at the crucial moment, he\nsuddenly thought of something. If we can\ncapture him alive and hand him over to\nthe embroidered uniform guard, we might\nbe able to get some information out of\nhim. With that in mind, Wayi Wu decided\nagainst using the gun and switched to\nthe tailor tin stun gun. You killed Leaf\nFoam first and then you came to kill me.\nYour White Lotus sect is truly\naudacious. Aren't you protected by\ndivine powers? Perfect. I too am\nprotected by the thunder god. Let's see\nwhose backer is stronger. As he spoke,\nWeii Wu continued walking. On the other\nside, whether out of arrogance or\ncaution, the burly man showed no\nintention of making a move. He only\nspoke slowly after Wei Wu approached to\nwithin about 10 m. Divine protection.\nI am Wong Gang, the great protector of\nthe white lotus true man, a disciple of\nthe eternal mother. What is a mere\nthunder god? Can he protect you? So,\nyou're showing off, huh? Well, then I'm\nnone other than Mikami. Huh? Cheyeni,\nTanaka, Asahi, and Okita sensei's little\nbrother. What's your mother compared to\nthat? Can she even get inside you? After\nhearing what we woo said, Protector Wong\nGang was stunned on the spot. I went\nthrough all the names and titles of gods\nand Buddhas in my mind, but I couldn't\nfind any that matched up. What does Wayi\nWu mean by sit down as my younger\nbrother? Does it mean he is not a\ndisciple, but a younger brother? Then he\nsuddenly realized that Weii Wu dared to\nblaspheme the eternal mother and his\nanger immediately surged up. But before\nhe could explode, Weii Wu suddenly\nraised his hand, holding a strange\nobject in his palm. Before he could\nreact, he heard Wayi Wu shout from the\nother side. \"With my true energy\ncombined with the creation of heaven and\nearth, and with the help of the thunder\ngod of the three realms, I will crush\nthis bastard.\" No sooner had he finished\nspeaking than we Woo pulled the trigger\nof the stun gun driven by nitrogen gas.\nA probe with barbs was launched at a\nspeed of 60 m/s. The probe then\naccurately struck Wong Gang and a\npowerful electric current instantly\nspread through him. To Wu surprise, Wong\nGang did not immediately fall to the\nground despite the electric shock.\nAlthough my body was indeed trembling,\nmy limbs seemed to be shaking\nuncontrollably.\nBut Wong Gang actually held on and even\nmanaged to control his right hand, try\nto pull the probe out. Seeing how fierce\nthis guy was, Wayi Wu dared not\nunderestimate him and pulled the trigger\nthree more times. Three probes flew out\nat high speed and struck Wong Gangs\nneck, heart, and bladder, respectively.\nAt this point, Wong Gang finally\ncouldn't hold on any longer and\ncollapsed to the ground, convulsing.\nEven so, Wayi Wu did not intend to cut\noff the power, but immediately took out\nthe stun gun and handed it to Shenllin.\nShunlin, take this over there. If he can\nstill move after I stop, shock him as\nhard as you can. After speaking, we wu\nquietly explained the location of the\nsafety device and the switch. After\nreceiving the stun gun from Wayi Wu,\nShenllin was immediately eager to try it\nout. He had personally witnessed how\nLanu fell to the ground under the\nelectrobaten. He had a vivid memory of\nthis thing and now he was fortunate\nenough to experience its power\nfirsthand. He even had a slight hope\nthat Wong Gang would be able to move a\nlittle bit in a while, even if it's just\na slight tremor in the little finger.\nChapter 104. The assassin is captured in\na secret talk with Zhu Bowo at the tea\nhouse. Unfortunately, Shan Linn's\nexpectations were ultimately dashed. The\nTaylor 10 stun gun in Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s hand\ndidn't seem to have much power, but in\nreality, its voltage is also 50,000\nvolts, the same as Wei Wu's stun gun.\nUnder the continuous electric shocks\nfrom the stun gun, Wong Gangs protective\nsupernatural powers couldn't hold for\nlong before he was knocked unconscious.\nShinl observed very carefully from the\nside, but Wong Gang didn't make a sound\nat all. Soak the hemp rope in water and\ntie him up. Then put a few iron chains\naround his neck. This guy is very\nfierce. Even without Wu&lt;unk&gt;s reminder,\nJean Hai had already organized the\nservants in his household to start\nlooking for the items. However, before\nthe servants could find the ropes and\nchains, Hao arrived first with the\nimperial guards. As soon as he entered,\nJang Hao quickly walked up to Wei Wu.\nI'm late. Please forgive me, Lord Chong.\nLook, all right, we've known each other\nfor ages. Let's not be so formal. Weii\nWu waved his hand casually, then asked\nanother question. Have they caught the\nguy who got away? Jean Hgho nodded and\nsaid, \"We caught him.\" After he finished\nspeaking, he raised his hand and waved\nit, and several Imperial guards escorted\na lean man over. To be honest, Wayi was\nquite surprised to see this guy. I just\nsaw him weaving through the crowd. His\nmovements were incredibly agile and\nsharp. They thought the Imperial guards\nmight not be able to catch him, but they\nactually managed to bring him back.\nHowever, upon seeing the small arrow on\nthe lean man's leg, everything became\nclear. The embroidered uniform guard was\nthe emperor's personal army. And in\naddition to their exclusive uniforms and\nweapons, they were also equipped with\ncrossbows. Clearly, this lean man had\nbeen defeated by the crossbow. Just as\nWei Wu was sizing up the man, Jean Hao\nsuddenly spoke up. Lord Chonglu, I've\nsent men to bring these two people back\nto the Imperial prison for\ninterrogation. Any news will be sent\nover immediately. After saying that,\nJean Hao suddenly leaned close to Wayi\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s ear and whispered something\nelse. His highness, the crown prince,\nrushed over as soon as he learned of\nyour assassination attempt, but I\narranged for him to stay at the Tianang\nTea house next door. Weiiu was initially\npuzzled as to why Jeang Hao is acting so\nmysteriously. However, after Jean Hao\nfinished speaking, he immediately\nunderstood and secretly praised Jean Hao\nfor his good arrangement, the members of\nthe White Lotus Cult are all madmen, and\nit's uncertain whether there are any\nother members of the White Lotus Cult.\nNo matter how many people protect Zuao,\nthe safest thing is to stay out of\nsight. After all, nothing in this world\ncan be absolutely controlled, and having\nmany people protecting you doesn't\nguarantee peace of mind. It's worth\nnoting that even presidents in later\ngenerations could be assassinated and Zu\nXionging in the palace today was able to\ncontract smallpox. Even if Zhu Yuan Jang\nand Zhu Bao were incredibly powerful,\nthey were still just human beings, not\nomnisient and omnipotent gods. If things\nget out of control and something really\nhappens to Zuao, then the sky over the\nentire Ming dynasty will collapse. Weii\nwas a little confused. Wasn't Zhu Bao in\nthe Eastern Palace? How could he have\narrived so quickly? With his doubts in\nmind, Weii Wu left the Behi Chaosing\nBuilding with Jean Hao private room on\nthe second floor of Tian Tea House. Weii\nWu and Zhu Bao sat facing each other on\neither side of the tea table. Brotherhu,\nwhy did you come in person and so\nquickly? It's not about speed, it's\nabout skill. Zu Bao sighed softly as he\nspoke, then continued. The elephant\ncarriage I promised to send you is\nready. I sent Leo with men to deliver it\nto you. But all the palace servants died\nand Leo also disappeared. Worried that\nLeo might harm you, he brought his men\nto your house only to hear that Leah had\nbrought the male servants from your\nhousehold to the Chin Huai River.\nThinking you might be in danger, I\nbrought more men over, but I never\nexpected you would actually encounter an\nassassin. Upon hearing this, Wayi Wu\nnodded, having understood what had\nhappened. However, upon hearing Zhu Bowo\nmention Leo, we immediately took out the\npiece of cloth. Brotherhu, this was\nwritten by Leo before he died. On his\ndeathbed, he specifically instructed\nLeah to give it to me. Zu Bao took the\npiece of cloth, glanced at it, and then\nfrowned slightly. White Lotus sect in\ndanger. Is Leong warning you that the\nWhite Lotus sect is dangerous and\ntelling you to be careful? Wayi Wu\nnodded and then voiced his guess. It\nshould be and if nothing unexpected\nhappens, Leong deliberately reminded me,\nhoping to use me to help him take\nrevenge. After the last assassination\nattempt, Leong knew how capable I was.\nAs long as I am on guard, any assassin\nwho dares to make a move is simply\ncourting death. Moreover, the guy who\njust attacked me admitted that he was a\nprotector of the White Lotus sect and\nthat Leon was killed by them. After\nlistening to Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s guests, Zhu\nBao lowered his head and pondered for a\nwhile before speaking. Shiao Wu, don't\nyou find it strange that the white lotus\nsex suddenly appeared, killed Lee Foam,\nand now wants to kill you, too? Wayi Wu\nwas taken aback for a moment, then\nunderstood the meaning behind Zhu Bao's\nwords. So, Brother Zu suspects that the\nWhite Lotus sect is the one hiding\nbehind the Lou family. I wasn't sure\nbefore, but now I'm pretty sure that the\nWhite Lotus sect is one of them. At this\npoint, Zhu Bao let out a soft sigh. As\nfor whether there's another one, I can't\nfind any clues at the moment, but I\nbelieve there must be one. After Lady\nLouu died, I did not pursue the matter\nagainst the Lou Clan. In fact, I\ndeliberately misled them into believing\nthat the smallox incident had not been\nexposed. The incident of falling into\nthe lake is suspicious, and the Lou\nfamily must be suspicious. But if they\nwant to find out the inside story, they\ncan only start by working on Leong.\nOriginally, I just wanted to find out\nLee Fangs identity through the Lou\nfamily, but I didn't expect that the\nWhite Lotus sect would also be involved.\nAt this point, Zhu Bao finished speaking\nand Wei Wu chimed in with a comment. If\nthe White Lotus sect had only targeted\nLee Fong, it would have been fine. But\nthey also came after me, which is\nproblematic. The only people in the\nentire Ming dynasty who have conflicts\nwith me are Lee Shan Chong and the Louu\nfamily. There is no doubt about Lee Shan\nChong. He could be directly ruled out.\nThen only the Louu family remains.\nBecause I ruined the smallox incident, I\nam the one they hate the most. When we\nwoo spoke, there was a hint of doubt in\nhis eyes. But there's still a problem\nhere. The Lou family isn't stupid. Would\nthey really do something without any\nbenefit to them? To put it bluntly, the\nWhite Lotus sect is just a bunch of\ncharlatans pretending to be gods and\nghosts. Has the Lou family gone mad?\nWhat do they want from colluding with\nthem? At this point, Zhua also shared\nhis thoughts. That's why I suspect\nthere's another person behind it all.\nThe White Lotus sect is probably just\nbeing used as a scapegoat. Just as Chow\nChow said, the White Lotus Sect was\nnothing but a rabble. They can only play\ntricks and deceive the ignorant masses.\nThey're not cut out for that. Therefore,\neven if the White Lotus sect emerged,\nZhuao would only think that they were\nbeing used. However, regardless of the\ncircumstances, now that the White Lotus\nsect has emerged, he must take action.\nZu Bao kept Leo around to try and find\nout who is behind it all. Now that Leong\nis dead and the trail has gone cold,\nthere's no need for Zuao to hide his\nmurderous intent anymore. Seeing the\nmurderous intent flashing in Zu\nBao&lt;unk&gt;s eyes, Wayi Wu immediately\nguessed what he wanted to do. Brotherhu,\nyou're not going to keep the Lou family\naround to investigate who's behind them.\nZu Bao nodded, his eyes flashing even\ncolder. They deserve to die. The White\nLotus cult dares to kill you. We must\nthoroughly investigate their strongholds\nand eradicate them all. Upon hearing\nthis, we wu smiled faintly, turned his\nhead, and stared intently at Juba. Then\nwe&lt;unk&gt;ll lotus sect after we find out\nwhat's going on. But can I handle the Lu\nfamily in Jang myself? Chapter 105 shows\nZhu Bao the power of the M4 A1. Upon\nhearing we Wu say this, Zhu Bao was in a\nreal bind. It wasn't that he didn't\nbelieve Weii Wu had the ability to\nresolve the matter. Based on the methods\nway Woo has demonstrated so far, there's\na high probability that there are no\nproblems. However, the risks remain and\nare not insignificant. Under these\ncircumstances, how could he possibly\nwatch Wei Wu take such a risk?\nTherefore, Zhua&lt;unk&gt;s first reaction to\nWei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s request was to dissuade\nhim. Shiao Wu, I understand that you are\nangry, but I would rather you resent me\nand blame me than take the risk\nyourself. And Zhu Bao was about to say\nsomething, but way suddenly reached out\nand interrupted him. Brotherhu, I think\nyou've misunderstood. I don't have the\ntime or inclination to travel all the\nway from the capital to Sujo to kill\nsomeone. What I mean is, I'll send my\nguards to Sujo to deal with the Lou\nfamily, just to give them some practice\nfirst. After all, when a Ming dynasty\nsends troops to fight the Japanese\npirates in the future, I plan to bring\nthem with me to the battlefield. In\nfact, Wayi Wu also wanted to go to Sujo\nin person, and he was confident that he\ncould persuade Zu Bao to agree. However,\nhe was well aware of the priorities, and\nhis most important task now was to build\nthe steam engine. After all, ship\nbuilders needed time to redesign the\ntreasure ship to convert it into a steam\nship. If everything is prepared as soon\nas possible and steam ships are built,\nOld Zu can order an expedition to the\neast to conquer the Japanese pirate\nsooner. Compared to the personal grudges\nwith the Louu family, the massacre of\nJapanese pirates was clearly more\nimportant. As for the Louu family, they\ncan be used to familiarize Shinllin and\nhis group with the feeling of killing\nwith guns. After hearing Wei Wu's\nexplanation, Zuao immediately breathed a\nsigh of relief. As long as Wei Wu\ndoesn't personally take the risk,\neverything else is negotiable. All\nright. As long as you don't act\nimpulsively, you can do whatever you\nwant with the Lou family. By the way, do\nyou have enough manpower? I see that you\nonly have 12 guards in your household.\nThat's probably not enough. Would you\nlike me to give you some more? Upon\nhearing this, Wayi Wu chuckled and\nimmediately took out an M4 A1 and placed\nit on the table. Actually, a pistol\ndemonstration would have been sufficient\nat this point, but Wu's gun didn't have\nmany bullets. Try not to waste it if you\ncan avoid it. After all, it's a valuable\nitem for your personal safety. The M4A1\nis different. It has over 400,000 rounds\nof ammunition in stock, so you can use\nit however you want. Upon seeing the\nstrangely shaped object in front of him,\nZhu Bao immediately perked up. He didn't\nrecognize what it was, but he knew very\nwell that what we Woo had brought out\nwas definitely not ordinary. Just as Zu\nBao was filled with anticipation, Weii\nWu spoke up again. This is called the\nM4A1\nautomatic rifle. Like the pistol, it is\na firearm, but its power and accuracy\nare worlds apart. It doesn't need to be\nloaded with gunpowder or loaded with\nprojectiles repeatedly. Just pulling the\ntrigger is enough to turn a person into\na civ. It's a pity that our Ming\ndynasty's industrial level is too low at\npresent. Otherwise, if we equip them\nwith this kind of weapon, the cavalry\nwould no longer be an ace, but just a\nmoving target. At this point, Wayi Wu\ntook out a riot shield from the\nwarehouse and handed it to Zuao, mainly\nto prevent any stray bullets from\nfalling. He then greeted the people\noutside, telling them to stay away and\nnot to panic. After making these\npreparations, he held the rifle in his\nhand and aimed the muzzle at the\nloadbearing wooden pillar in the corner\nof the room. Brotherhu, you'll\nunderstand after you see this. With it\naround, the number of people is never a\nproblem, and any danger will only befall\nothers. After saying that, Wayi Wu\npulled the trigger, and an orange yellow\nbullet shot out from the barrel. Da da\nda da. A faint bluish green smoke\nswirled around and the private room was\ninstantly filled with a somewhat pungent\nsmell of gunpowder. But that's not the\npoint. The point is that in burst mode,\nWayi Wu emptied the magazine in less\nthan 3 seconds. Under the barrage of\nbullets, the loadbearing wooden pillars\nwere riddled with splinters as if they\nhad been torn apart by a ferocious\nbeast. The white yellow fibers inside\nthe wood are exposed to the air and\nintertwined, giving it a menacing\nappearance. Zu Bao put down the ride\nshield, stood up, and slowly walked to\nthe loadbearing wooden pillar, reaching\nout to touch it. He then bent down,\npicked up the spent cartridge case from\nthe ground, and twirled it between his\nfingers for a while. copper. This this\nkind of firearm actually uses copper to\nmake the projectiles. It's no wonder\nZuao was so surprised as copper was\nbasically synonymous with money in that\nera. To him, making bullets with copper\nwas equivalent to making bullets with\nmoney. Moreover, the bullet casing is\nheavier than a copper coin in addition\nto the rate of fire just now. If, as\nWeii Wu said, the army were equipped\nwith such weapons, which country could\nwithstand such a drain. While Zhu Bao\nwas still in shock, Weii Wu put down his\ngun and came to his side. I want\nShinllin and the others to go to Sujo,\nnot only for revenge, but also to\nfamiliarize them with the use of this\nweapon. Not only the Lou family of Sujo,\nbut if we can find out where the White\nLotus sect is gathered, I also hope to\ninvolve them in its eradication. Of\ncourse, we&lt;unk&gt;ll need your help,\nBrotherh Zu, to have them officially\nregistered as members of the embroidered\nuniform guard, which will make things\neasier for them. Upon regaining his\nsenses, Zhu Bao nodded immediately upon\nhearing Weii Wu&lt;unk&gt;s words. It's all\nright. I'll arrange this for you. Having\nthe identity of a member of the\nembroidered uniform guard will indeed\navoid a lot of trouble. Upon receiving\nZhua&lt;unk&gt;s reply, Weii Wu smiled. He\ncould almost see Shaun Linn and his men\narmed with automatic rifles mowing down\nthe Lou family in their home. Of course,\nbefore that, they should first\nfamiliarize themselves with the\noperation and feel of the firearms. Wayi\nWu had already decided on the shooting\nrange, which would be located within the\nInstitute. Thinking of this, Wayi Wu\nwished he could immediately arrange for\nShan Lin and the others to start\nlearning to shoot. Just as We Wu was\ngetting impatient, Zhu Bao suddenly\nspoke up. Xiao Wu, now that this matter\nis settled, I should return to the\npalace. By the way, Xanglu, why don't\nyou go back and give a try? If you\nencounter any problems, just let me\nknow. Zuao stood up immediately after\nspeaking and Wei Wu followed suit. I was\njust about to go to the Academy of\nSciences. I went to the palace early\nthis morning and haven't gone to teach\nthe craftsman yet. After leaving the tea\nhouse, Zhu Bao returned to the palace\nwhile Wei Wu went to the Beehive Chowing\nTower. The guards who had been knocked\ndown earlier have woken up and now Shin\nLinshuan is about to suffer a terrible\nfate. Seeing their ashamed expressions,\nWeii Wu smiled and stroed over. Young\nmaster, young master, we are\nincompetent. We failed to protect your\nsafety. Young master, please punish me.\nUpon seeing Weii Wu return, the guards\nall stepped forward, knelt on one knee\nbefore him, and bowed their heads to beg\nfor forgiveness. Seeing the shame on\ntheir faces, Weii Wu laughed. There's no\nneed for punishment. Although you failed\nto protect me, it's only because you\nwere weak while the enemy was very\nstrong. Hearing that Wayi Wu did not\nblame them for their inadequate\nprotection, the guards felt somewhat\nrelieved. But upon hearing the last\nsentence, their expressions of shame\ndeepened. If a guard cannot protect the\nsafety of his master, what kind of guard\nis he? Regardless of whether it was\nbecause the enemy was strong, the fact\nremains that we failed to protect them\nproperly. Just as the guards were\nblaming themselves, we woo&lt;unk&gt;s words\nignited their depressed mood. So next, I\nwill make you strong. Strong enough to\nface any powerful enemy. Chapter 1 06.\nBeing stuck in the past hinders\nprogress. You could tell from the\nexpressions on the guard's faces that\nthey were also quite frustrated. To be\nhonest, Wayi Wu did not blame them.\nAdmittedly, the guard's performance and\nwhat just happened was truly appalling.\nThey were dealt with so easily. But what\nWayu truly cared about wasn't that. What\nhe really cared about was that they were\nrisking their lives to fight the enemy.\nEven after being beaten down to the last\nperson standing by that freak Wong Gang,\nthis person did not back down in the\nslightest. He still stood in front of\nWong Gang holding a steel knife as if he\nwere stepping over my corpse. They\ncertainly did their job to the best of\ntheir ability, but unfortunately the gap\nin strength between the two sides was\ntoo great. But is strength a problem for\nWayi Woo? No. What good is individual\nstrength if it can outdamage a gun? Can\nit be faster than a bullet? What we woo\ntruly valued was their loyalty, their\nwillingness to risk their lives for him.\nLet's go. Follow me to the Academy of\nSciences. I'll show you what real power\nis. After saying this, Wayi Wu led his\nguards away from the Beehive Chaos\nbuilding. Back at the Academy of\nSciences, Wayi Wu heard a shout as soon\nas he entered. Vice Dewi, please wait.\nWeii Wu turned his head and saw that it\nwas the three craftsmen who were\nresearching firearms. Stopped by the\nthree craftsmen, Wayi Wu was also\npuzzled, so he stopped and asked, \"The\nthree of you, is there something you\nneed from me?\" Upon hearing Weii\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s question, the three of them\nquickly jogged over to him. But when\nthey got close, they hesitated and\ndidn't say a word for a long time.\nSeeing this, Wayi Wu didn't want to\nwaste any more time here. Why don't you\nthink about what you need first and then\ncome find me. After saying this, Wayi Wu\ntook a step to leave. But finally, the\noldest craftsman among them spoke up.\nVice Dean Wei, it's like this. The three\nof us came to see you, hoping you can\nlet us go back to the Ministry of Works.\nUpon hearing the craftsman's words, Wayi\nWu raised an eyebrow, stared at the\nthree of them, and asked, \"Want to go\nback? Tell me your reasons, and if I'm\nsatisfied, I might let you go back.\" The\nthree craftsmen exchanged glances, and\nthen the older craftsman spoke. \"Your\ntechnology is indeed amazing. However,\nthe three of us only know how to make\nfirearms and we only want to focus on\nmaking firearms. With you, all our\nskills are useless. We are like\ncripples. It would be better to let us\ngo back and serve the court. Moreover,\nthose young juniors in the ordinance\nbureau also need someone to keep an eye\non them. Otherwise, without supervision,\nthey will definitely run wild. After the\nold craftsmen finished speaking, Wayi\nWoo finally understood. They said they\nwanted to go back to serve the imperial\ncourt, but in reality they felt they\nwere wasting their talents. They feel\nthey have no future here, but they're\njust saying it in such a high-ounding\nway because they're afraid of offending\nme due to my position. I guess they\nassigned tasks to everyone else\nyesterday, but forgot to include these\nthree. Besides worrying that they might\nbe overlooking their talents, they\nprobably also felt a sense of\nresentment. Although this is only\nnatural. Chow Chow would not tolerate\ntheir bad habits. You three think you\nknow how to make firearms? Huh? Forgive\nme for being blunt, but what you've made\nisn't firearms. It's just scrap metal.\nIf you want to go back, you can. I won't\nstop you. But remember this. Once you\nleave this door, you can forget about\never coming back in. After saying that,\nWayi Wu pointed to the gate behind him\nand then prepared to leave with his men.\nBut after hearing what we woo said, the\nold craftsman was not happy. Vice Dean\nWei, you can scold me and humiliate me,\nbut you can't say that the firearms I\nmade are scrap metal. They are my hard\nwork. I followed your majesty when you\nfirst started the rebellion. When it\ncomes to firearms, no one in the Ming\ndynasty has put in more effort than me.\nIf it weren't for my dedication to\noverseeing the manufacturing process at\nthe Ordinance Bureau, the firearms of\nour great Ming dynasty would have been\nruined by those young upstarts long ago.\nNo wonder only this one of three dared\nto speak. It turns out he rose to power\nunder Zu Yuan Jong. But now it's the\n15th year of the Hong Wu reign, and this\nperson is still just a lowly craftsman.\nHe couldn't even get a sixth rank\nofficial position, which is probably\nrelated to his arrogant and\ncondescending personality. However, the\ncraftsman's last words caught Wei Woos\nattention. What did you mean by saying\nyou strictly adhere to the production\nprocess? And what about those\ntroublemakers from the younger\ngeneration? This elderly craftsman who\nalways took pride in his perseverance\nimmediately continued upon hearing we\nwoos question. Those younger generations\ndon't think about honing their skills\nproperly. Instead, they have wild ideas\nand recklessly tamper with what their\npredecessors left behind. A musket is\n12.5 in long and 0.6 in wide with a\nbronze body. Only musketss made in this\nway can be called musketss. Those\nyounger generations have wild ideas. Try\nto replace copper with iron. And even\nmore so, they want to change the shape\nof the musket. It's just nonsense. As\nlong as I am alive, I will absolutely\nnot allow them to act recklessly.\nOtherwise, the firearms of my great Ming\ndynasty will be completely ruined.\nWaywood found it strange before that the\nold craftsman said the young people\nwould act recklessly if he wasn't there.\nNow I finally understand why firearms,\nwhich existed since the Yuan dynasty,\nnever achieved greater development. From\nZhu Yuan Jang to Zhu D in the early Ming\ndynasty, the mainstream firearms were\nmainly hand cannons and bull-shaped\ncannons. It wasn't until the Jaing era\nthat it was upgraded and replaced with a\nthree-barrel gun. It is because of\npeople like this who are rigid and\ninflexible, unwilling to innovate\nthemselves and even suppressing others\nfrom innovating. This led to the slow\nprogress of firearms development in a\nMing dynasty. These old fogies cling to\nwhat their predecessors left behind as\ngolden rules, refusing to allow any\nchanges whatsoever. Ironically, within\nthe artisan community, the older and\nmore experienced they are, the greater\ntheir influence, suppressed by such\npeople. Any changes made by the younger\ngeneration of craftsmen are seen as\noutrageous. At this moment, Wayi Wu was\ntruly grateful that this person had\nstepped forward on his own. Keeping such\na black sheep around would definitely be\na disaster. But along with relief came\nanger and helplessness. Such people are\nno longer just harming themselves and\nothers. They can even escalate to the\npoint of harming the country and\ncivilization. If it weren't for the old\ncraftsman's advanced age, Wayi Wu would\nhave definitely beaten him up to vin his\nanger. Respecting the wisdom of our\npredecessors is not wrong. It is even\nvery necessary because it is a form of\ninheritance. What future generations\nshould do is discard the dross and\nselect the essence and on this basis\nsurpass their predecessors looking at\nthe proud old craftsman in front of him.\nWeii wu suppress the urge to attack and\nlooked at the other two. And you do you\nthink the same way he does that all you\nneed to do is hone your skills and not\nchange what your predecessors did? Upon\nhearing Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s question, the other\ntwo nodded almost without hesitation.\nSeeing this, even if the three people\ndidn't want to leave, Wayi Wu would\nstill drive them away. But before that,\nWayi Wu wanted to tear their proud\nprinciples to shreds. I was very rude of\nme to say that your firearms were scrap\nmetal. I shouldn't have said that. Upon\nhearing Wu&lt;unk&gt;s words, the old\ncraftsman immediately stroked his beard\nand nodded slowly. Just as he was about\nto use his seniority to say something\nlike this young man is teachable, he\nheard we woos next words. What did scrap\niron do to deserve this? I actually used\nit to describe something that's\nworthless. No, it's not even worth as\nmuch as scrap. Chapter 107. Are musketss\neven worthy of being compared to\nautomatic rifles? The old craftsman, who\nhad initially been somewhat pleased,\nbristled with anger upon hearing these\nwords. Looking at his violently heaving\nchest, Wayi Wu wondered if he might die\nof anger on the spot. Even if he were to\ndie of anger, Wayu would not feel any\nguilt, for the old man had angered him\nquite a bit. And judging from the old\nman's appearance, it seems that if he\nweren't worried about losing, he would\nprobably have challenged him to a\none-on-one fight. After a long while,\nthe old craftsman finally caught his\nbreath and stared intently at Wei Wu,\nquestioning him. \"My lord, even if it\nmeans my death, I dare to ask you this.\nOn what grounds do you belittle the\nfirearms I manufacture?\" Upon hearing\nthis, we wu sneered and replied\ncasually. \"On what grounds? Because I'm\ntelling the truth. The firearms you\nmanufacture are worse than scrap.\" The\nold craftsman's eyes widened and he was\nabout to speak when we wu continued.\nAren't you leaving? The door is over\nthere. Hurry up and leave. My research\ninstitute doesn't need people who create\nwaste. After saying that, we woo didn't\neven glance at him and waved to Shunlin\nand the other guards. Come on, young\nmaster will bring out some good stuff\ntoday and show you what real firearms\nare. Seeing that way, Wu had already\nturned and left. Shun Linn and the\nothers glanced at the old craftsman\nsideways and then quickly followed him.\nThe old craftsman, who was already full\nof anger, couldn't hold back any longer\nwhen he saw the look in Shanl&lt;unk&gt;s\neyes, ignoring everything else. He\ngrabbed two other people and followed\nbehind Wei Woo and the others. today. He\nwanted to see why we woo had the right\nto belittle the firearms he had made and\nwhat gives them the audacity to claim\nthey'll bring out even better firearms.\nHe even had a plan in mind how to\ncriticize Wei Woos so-called real\nfirearms. Weii Wu was aware of the three\nold craftsmen following behind him. But\nthat was precisely his purpose. If these\nthree hadn't come, how could he have\ntorn their pride to shreds? When Zhu\nYuan Jang selected the site for the\nAcademy of Sciences, he specifically\nallocated a thousand acres of fertile\nland to it. The training ground that way\nWu chose for Shunlin and the others was\nright in these fields. Before that,\nhowever, he found a room and took out 12\nrifles and two ammunition boxes. Only\nthen did they send the guards carrying\nguns and ammunition boxes to the field.\nInterestingly, other craftsmen from the\nscience institute also came along during\nthis process. They weren't there to see\nthe firearms. They just wanted to watch\nthe spectacle. Upon arriving in the\nmiddle of the field, Weii Wu first\ninstructed Shinllin to have someone\nerect a wooden plank in the field. The\nlength and width of this wooden plank\nare about the same as a coffin board,\nbut it is not as thick. Seeing that Shan\nwas ready, we wu turned to look at the\ncraftsmen who are watching the\nspectacle. Can anyone tell me how\npowerful a musket is? Can it penetrate\nthis wooden plank at a distance of 20\npaces? Although the craftsmen who were\nwatching the spectacle were not firearms\nmanufacturers, they still had some\nknowledge of this thing. Upon hearing we\nws question, someone immediately stepped\nforward and that person happened to be\nsanghon. Sean came over to the wooden\nplank, looked it over, and then said\nwith great certainty, \"Vice Dean Wei,\nwith the power of a musket, \"It is\nabsolutely impossible to penetrate this\nwooden board from 20 paces.\" After Song\nJang finished speaking, Wayi Wu nodded\nand casually picked up the M4A1\nautomatic rifle to begin adjusting it.\nIf it were the M1911, Wayi Wu really\nwouldn't dare to test the gun in front\nof so many people. He had a very clear\nunderstanding of his own marksmanship.\nHe wasn't that accurate. He could never\nfind the right shooting state with a\nthree-point aiming method. If the bullet\nmisses its mark, it won't be a slap in\nthe face to the old craftsman, but a\nslap in the face to oneself. But now\nhe's using the M4A1, so he's not afraid\nanymore because this thing is equipped\nwith a scope. Without a scope, he's a\ncomplete noob. But with a scope, he'd\ncall himself a sharpshooter. Although it\nwas self-proclaimed, his marksmanship\nwould indeed be much more accurate with\na scope. After adjusting the gun,\nswitched the firing mode to burst fire\nand fire two to three bullets at a time.\nWeii Wu, under the watchful eyes of the\ncrowd, arrived at a position 30 m away\nfrom the wooden plank. He held the gun,\naimed, concentrated, and then decisively\npulled the trigger. The hadada. With the\naid of the scope, the bullet accurately\nhit the wooden board 30 m away after it\nleft the barrel. But Wayi Wu did not\nstop there. He would pull the trigger\nevery two or 3 seconds thereafter. He\ndidn't stop until he had emptied the\nentire magazine, then quietly looked at\nthe wooden plank. The M4A1 has a high\ninitial bullet velocity, making it a\nformidable weapon within 100 m. It was\ninevitable that the plank would be\npierced, and Wei Wu had no worries\nwhatsoever. Seeing that we woo was\nstanding still, the craftsmen who had\nbeen watching the commotion couldn't\nhelp but go over to check. Needless to\nsay, the three firearms craftsmen were\neven more eager to see the outcome.\nHowever, the old craftsman was\ndisappointed. He had prepared a lot of\nwords, but now he could only stare\nblankly at the wooden board. The once\nsmooth and clean wooden board now has 28\nsmall holes, each one penetrating\nthrough it.\nWhy is this happening? No, this isn't\nright. This isn't a musket at all. How\ncould a musket not be loaded with\ngunpowder? How could a musket fire\ncontinuously? You didn't even load any\nbullets. The old craftsman excitedly\npointed at the wooden board and shouted,\nquestioning whether Weii Wu was\ncheating. At this moment, Weii Wu had\nalready arrived at the wooden plank with\nhis spear. Upon hearing the old\ncraftsman's words, he simply replied\nwith a single sentence. \"I never said\nthis was a musket. I've been talking\nabout firearms from beginning to end. Do\nyou even understand what a firearm is?\"\nAt this point, Wayi Wu deliberately\nbrandished the M4 A1 in his hand.\nBesides, do you think it's appropriate\nto compare it to a musket? It's an\ninsult to it. An insult to you, don't\nyou understand? With just two simple\nsentences, the old craftsman was left\nspeechless, his face turning a deep\npurple from holding it in. But Wayu only\nglanced at him before looking at\nSanghon. What's the maximum range a\nmusket can fire again? As soon as he\nfinished speaking, Sejong glanced at the\nold craftsman with a gloating\nexpression, then immediately replied,\n\"Vice Dean Wei,\" \"The musket can\nprobably fire for about 40 to 50 ft, but\nit loses its power beyond 30 ft.\" In the\nMing dynasty, one jang was equal to 3.33\nm. Weii Wu did the conversion in his\nmind. 50h Jang is roughly 160 m, which\nis all right. It didn't exceed his limit\nof 200 meters. A weapon that has no\npower after 30 feet deserves to be\ncalled a firearm and can only hit\ntargets up to 50 feet away. Is it really\nthat shabby? After making a casual\nremark, Wayi Wu picked up his rifle,\nturned around, and walked away into the\ndistance. The people around weren't\nfools. They had just witnessed the power\nof the rifle firsthand. Now that Wayi\nWoo was clearly going to continue\nshooting, everyone immediately ran to a\ndistance to watch. Soon they reached a\ndistance of about 160 m and Wei Woo\nraised his rifle and aimed again.\nChapter 108. What I said is not just a\nprinciple, it is the truth. Although the\ndistance was more than 160 m,\nfortunately, it was just target practice\nand not ring shooting. Such a large\nwooden board. As long as the bullets\ndon't miss the target, the difficulty is\nstill acceptable. The da the firing mode\nremains the same. Three bullets are\nfired from the barrel at a time. Seeing\ntwo more bullet holes in the wooden\nboard through the scope, Weii Wu&lt;unk&gt;s\nlips curled into a smile, he stopped\nfiring and instead picked up his rifle\nand returned to the crowd. The three\nfirearms craftsmen and the onlookers had\nalready gathered around the wooden\nplanks a moment earlier. The other\ncraftsmen were all astonished to see the\ntwo extra holes in the wooden board.\nOnly the three firearms craftsmen,\nespecially the old craftsmen, looked as\nif they had lost their parents. It\ncannot be denied that this old craftsman\nis stubborn and inflexible. But his\ncraftsmanship cannot be denied either.\nIn terms of making firearms, he was\ndefinitely the top craftsman in the Ming\ndynasty. That is why he understood\nbetter than anyone the difference\nbetween firearms and weapons like those\nused by Wei Woo. At the same time, he\nunderstood something more clearly. No\nmatter how good one's skills are or how\nexquisite one's workmanship is, a musket\ncan never achieve this effect. At a\ndistance of 50 Jang or more, the\naccuracy of the musket bullets was\nnon-existent. Whether they hit or not\nwas entirely up to fate. Wiiwu's\nfirearms not only hit the target\naccurately, but also managed to pierce\nthe wooden plank from such a distance.\nIt can be said that it completely\ncrushes the firearms it made. How could\nhe, who had been proud of this his whole\nlife, accept this calmly? Back on the\nwooden plank, Wayi Wu looked at the old\ncraftsman with a dejected expression and\ncasually asked a question, \"So, now that\nI've told you the firearms you made are\nrubbish, are you still not convinced?\"\nThe old craftsman bowed his head and\nremained silent, unable to utter a\nsingle word for a long time. At this\nmoment, we woo spoke again. Do you know\nwhere you went wrong? The old craftsman\nshook his head and remained silent. If I\ntold you that this firearm of mine was\nevolved from a hand cannon, would you\nbelieve me? Whoosh. Upon hearing Wei\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s words, the old craftsman\nsuddenly raised his head and looked at\nWei Wu with a surprise expression.\nNo matter how well-made or skilled the\ncraftsman, a musket could never reach\nthis level. After listening to what the\nold craftsman said, Wayi Wu immediately\nretorted without any politeness.\nNonsense because you're always doing\nthis, but you don't realize that\neverything in the world has its limits.\nYou old stubborn person only knows how\nto stick to what our predecessors left\nbehind. And you don't allow any changes\nor mistakes. But they don't understand\nthat what their ancestors passed down\nwas meant to help future generations to\nrefine and improve upon it and to\nsurpass them based on that foundation.\nWeii Wu grew increasingly angry as he\nspoke, eventually pointing his finger\ndirectly at the old craftsman's nose.\nIt's people like you who stifle the\ncreativity of younger generations,\nturning them into puppets who can only\ndo things they dare not even think\nabout. If our predecessors had all been\nas complacent and unambitious as you, it\nwould have been a miracle if the\nfirearms you were so proud of had been\ncreated. Medicine, iron tools, weaving,\npaper, and printing all have been able\nto develop better through change and\ninnovation. At this point, we woo\nsuddenly recalled that great man who\nappeared only once every few thousand\nyears, radiating dazzling sunlight. The\nwords he had spoken immediately came to\nWayi Wu&lt;unk&gt;s mind. The world belongs to\nour ancestors and to our descendants.\nBut ultimately, it belongs to the\nyounger generation who are full of vigor\nand vitality. They are at their peak\nlike the rising sun hanging in the sky\nat dawn. Hope and the future are placed\non them. The old craftsman was several\ndecades old. Yet, he was being bered by\nWei Woo, a young man. How could he\npossibly accept this? As for what we Woo\nsaid, he didn't actually listen to a\nword of it. However, due to the facts\nbefore him and Weii Wu&lt;unk&gt;s identity,\nhe dared not and had no confidence to\nrefute them. That's why they say they're\nstubborn and inflexible. If it could be\nchanged so easily by a few words, he\nwouldn't be so stubborn at his age.\nInterestingly, while the old craftsmen\nremained unchanged, the two craftsmen\nbeside him did have some ideas. The\nreason they left with the old craftsmen\nwas because there was no future there.\nNow that their future is so brightly\nlaid out before them, how could they\nbear to leave? With the firearms that we\nwoo had, even if we don't completely\nreplicate them, we can at least make\nthem about 30 or 40% similar. When the\nmilitary is equipped on a large scale in\nthe future, they will also rise in rank\nand be given official positions. So when\nwe wu finished speaking and the old\ncraftsman remained silent, the two of\nthem stepped forward. Vicei, I was\ndeceived by Su. Actually, I wanted to\nstay here, but he insisted that I go\nwith him. Yes, yes, me too, Vice. Su is\nstubborn, but I am not. I completely\nagree with what you said. Upon seeing\nhis two colleagues betray him, Su&lt;unk&gt;s\neyes widened in disbelief as he stared\nat them. However, that's just how the\nworld is. Profit is what people pursue.\nUnfortunately, these two were too\noptimistic. Even if they had been\nclamoring to leave before, given their\ncurrent character, Wayi Woo wouldn't\nwant them. So, when the two finished\nspeaking with expectant looks, all they\ncould see was Wei Woos indifferent face.\nWayi Wu first looked at the person who\nwas shouting that he had been deceived.\nYou want to stay here? But I don't want\nyou to stay here. My Ming Dynasty Royal\nInstitute has no need for pests. After\nsaying that, he turned to look at\nanother person and continued, \"I'm not\ntalking about reason. I'm talking about\nthe truth, and I don't need your\nagreement. Nor does the Academy of\nSciences need your agreement.\" Wayi Wu\nknew that his words were somewhat\narrogant. But he was very clear about\nthe situation in his heart. Putting\naside everything else, at least the last\nthing I said was the truth. The absolute\ntruth. Looking at the two embarrassed\ncraftsmen in front of him, Wayi Wu\nraised his hand and pointed to the gate.\nNow all three of you get out of the\ninstitute immediately. Feeling\nembarrassed by Wayi Wu's abrupt and\nviolent expulsion. The three turned and\nquickly left. Only then did Wayi Woo\nlook at the craftsmen who were watching\nthe spectacle. Do you know why I drove\nthem away? Because they were pedantic,\nstubborn, inflexible, unambitious, and\nincapable of adapting. I don't want you\nto be like them. I want you to open your\nminds. Combine the wisdom and experience\nof your predecessors and be bold in\ninnovating. Whether he truly listened or\nwas simply constrained by Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s\nstatus, it doesn't matter. After Wei Wu\nfinished speaking, all the craftsmen\nnodded to indicate that they understood.\nSeeing this, Wei Wu nodded in\nsatisfaction, then said to San Jong,\n\"Send someone to inform the Ministry of\nWorks that I don't want Su Ron and his\ntwo companions. Replace them with three\nambitious young men.\" That's all for\nnow. Everyone go about your business.\nI'll come back to teach you when I'm\ndone with my things. After Wayi Woo\nfinished speaking, the craftsman\nimmediately dispersed and left as they\nhad been eagerly anticipating today's\nclass. After the craftsman left, Wei Wu\nlooked at Shan Linn and the others and\nwaved the automatic rifle in his hand.\nHow about that? Pretty cool, huh? Want\nto learn? I'll teach you. Chapter 109,\nthe precision measuring tool, the\nmicrometer. Do you want to learn? Even\nwe woo himself felt that he had asked a\npointless question after he finished\nspeaking. If you're a man, how many of\nyou wouldn't like to learn how to shoot\na gun, no matter what kind of gun it is?\nIn later generations, even men who had\nno access to firearms would find ways to\npractice using handguns. Moreover, Shan\nLin and the others had just witnessed\nthe power of the rifles and were now\nextremely envious. Upon hearing Wei\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s words, they answered without\nhesitation. Learn, learn, young master.\nWant to learn? Even if we have to skip\nmeals, we must learn it. Young master,\nyou said this is what can make us\nstronger. That's wonderful. It can\npierce through wooden planks from 50 ft\naway. Once you learn this technique, no\none will be able to harm the young\nmaster in front of me. Seeing the guards\nall express their opinions, we wu wave\nhis hand and pointed to the wooden box\ncontaining the guns. That box contains\nwhat you want. I'll teach you how to use\nit next. But before that, at this point,\nWayi Wu stopped and gave them a stern\nlook. There's one thing I need to tell\nyou upfront. Remember it. Remember it\nwell. Never point a gun at your own\npeople. Understand? Seeing way Wu&lt;unk&gt;s\nserious expression, the guards all\nunderstood the importance of his words.\nClear? Upon hearing their reply, Weii Wu\nfinally smiled again. Very well.\nEveryone, take your guns. After saying\nthis, we handed the gun in his hand to\nShinl. Then 12 guards stood in a circle\nwith their guns pointed skyward\nsurrounding Wei Woo as he listened to\nhis explanation. How to pull the bolt,\nhow to change the magazine, how to load\nbullets, and how to adjust the firing\nmode. What actions should be taken when\nshooting, including how to use the scope\nfor accurate shooting. Wayu can be said\nto have taught them everything he knew\nwithout reservation. After all, we'll\nneed them to protect us in the future,\nso we can't leave anything out when we\nteach them. It's worth mentioning that\nChinese people seem to have a natural\ntalent for firearms, and this talent is\nquite strong. It was the first time\nShinl and the others had ever handled a\ngun, yet they immediately remembered\nwhat he said. All the steps in the\nprocess were completed in one go.\nAlthough their performance in the\nsubsequent live fire exercises was poor,\nthey adapted very quickly. Especially\nShinllin, that guy is practically\ncheating. He held the gun and fired 30\nshots in singleshot mode from 50 ft away\nwith 27 bullets hitting the target. I\nwasn't quite used to the first three\nbullets, but I really got better and\nbetter at it as I went on. Although the\ntarget was as big as a coffin lid,\nShinllin was from ancient times and\ndidn't even have the most basic\nknowledge of guns. His ability to adapt\nto this level in such a short time is\nenough to show that he is talented. This\nalso gave Wayi Wu a pleasant surprise.\nShunlin was able to adapt quickly, which\nmade things much easier for him.\nShunlin, you'll be in charge of training\nthem from now on. Here are two\nammunition boxes, each with 840 rounds\nof ammunition. Distribute them equally\nto everyone to familiarize themselves\nwith the use of firearms. Make your own\ntargets. Remember, safety first. Upon\nhearing we Woos instructions, Shinl\nimmediately stood up straight. Don't\nworry, young master. I will keep an eye\non them and make sure they don't cause\nany trouble. I will make sure they get\nfamiliar with the operation of the\nfirearms as soon as possible. Wayu\nnodded in satisfaction, then turned and\nleft. The two ammunition boxes together\nheld only 1,680\nrounds of ammunition, which meant each\nperson would only receive 140 rounds on\naverage. It said that sharpshooters are\nmade by feeding them bullets, but 140\nrounds of ammunition obviously can't\nmake a good marksman. But what Way\nneeded were not sharpshooters, but\nsimply people to become familiar with\nfirearms. Moreover, he didn't require\nthem to be very accurate. They could\njust fire a burst of bullets at the\nenemy and be done with it. After leaving\nthe firing range, Weii Wu went directly\nto the largest room in the Science and\nTechnology Research Institute. By this\ntime, the craftsmen were already waiting\nfor him there. Tell me about the\nproblems you've encountered from\nyesterday to today. After entering the\nroom, Wayi Wu didn't waste any words and\nwent straight to the point. Upon hearing\nhis words, someone immediately stood up.\nVice Dean Wei, let's call him Vice Dean.\nIt feels weird to have general manager\nin his name. Deputy Dean, as you\nrequested, we went to the iron foundry\nto smelt several furnaces of iron to\nmanufacture various parts. Although some\nitems have been made, some small parts\ncannot be inlaid or assembled because\nour bronze calipers are not precise\nenough. Upon hearing the craftsman's\nquestion, Wayi Wu paused for a moment,\nthen patted his head. All right, how\ncould I forget? Although verier calipers\nexisted in the Han Dynasty, their\naccuracy was far inferior. Fortunately,\nWayi Wu had something that could solve\nthis problem. Please wait a moment. Weii\nWu gestured for the craftsman to wait,\nthen turned and walked out of the main\nhouse. When he returned, he placed a\nblack briefcase on the podium. There are\nspecial measuring tools here called\nmicrometers, which are similar to bronze\ncalipers, but more precise. After saying\nthis, Wayi Wu opened his briefcase,\nwhich contained quite a few things, but\nthe most important of them were three\nmicrometers: outside micrometer, inside\nmicrometer, and depth micrometer. He\nexplained the contents of a suitcase one\nby one and then Weii Wu continued, \"The\nsymbols marked on this thing are numbers\nand the way they are written is\ndifferent from ours. You'll have to get\nused to it.\" Wayi Wu then showed them\nthe comparison between Chinese numerals\nand Arabic numerals. Next, they were\ngiven a lesson on units of length such\nas decimeter, millimeter, and\ncentimeter. As for how to convert and\nuse it, this is not a problem for these\ncraftsmen, and he doesn't need to worry\nabout it. After settling the issue of\ndimensions, another carpenter stood up\nand asked about the structure of the\nsteam engine. Fortunately, the question\nhe asked wasn't too tricky. He just got\nstuck on the cognitive aspect and\ncouldn't quite grasp it. With Wei Woos\nexplanation, the carpenter immediately\nunderstood. After that, there were no\nfurther questions, and Weii Woo\ncontinued to explain the basics of\nscience to everyone. Of course, it's not\nabout the periodic table, but about\nchanges that occur in nature and the\nreasons for their appearance. Although\nnot particularly detailed, it broadened\nthe horizons of these artisans and\ngradually changed their perception of\nnature. Time passed slowly, and we woo,\nengrossed in his lecture, forgot how\nmuch time had passed. It wasn't until\nthere was a knock on the door that Wei\nWoo, who was giving a lecture and a\ncraftsman listening to the lecture, came\nto their senses. Then a middle-aged man\nled two somewhat timid young men into\nthe room. Are you firearms craftsmen\nsent by the Ministry of Works? Upon\nhearing we woo&lt;unk&gt;s question, the\nmiddle-aged man at the head immediately\nbowed and said, \"We pay our respects to\nLord Chong Lo.\" It was the official from\nthe Ministry of Works who sent the three\nof us here to obey Lord Chong Lee's\norders. Upon hearing this, Wayi Wu\nsimply waved his hand. All right, I\ndon't call you being sent here. You're\nall here to learn new things just like\nthem. After saying that, Wayi Wu was a\nlittle worried that the Ministry of\nWorks might have some incompetent people\nfilling in. So, he asked another\nquestion. Since you're here, let me ask\nyou a question first. If the answer\nsatisfies me, you can come in and sit\ndown. Do you think the current gunpowder\nratio is perfect or is there room for\nimprovement? Chapter 1. 10. Do you think\ngunpowder is perfect now? The three\ncraftsmen never expected that they would\nbe tested so soon after their arrival.\nHowever, the question was within their\narea of expertise, and the three of them\nimmediately began to think about how to\nanswer it. Just then, we woo suddenly\nadded a sentence. By the way, don't try\nto guess what I want to hear. What I\nwant to hear is your most genuine\nthoughts. After we woo finished\nspeaking, the three men immediately\nMiddle-aged men tend to be more composed\nand he kept his head down deep in\nthought. On the contrary, one of the two\nyoung men immediately gave his answer.\nLord Chonglu, I believe that the current\ngunpowder does not need to be improved.\nUpon hearing this answer, Wayi Wu showed\nno expression on his face, simply\nreplying with a single sentence. Oh, go\non. I'd like to know how you arrived at\nthis answer. Upon hearing this, the\nyoung craftsman bowed to weigh Woo once\nmore before continuing. Then I'll say\nit. I believe that what gunpowder needs\nmost right now is improvement, not\nenhancement, because it is not perfect.\nOnly after perfecting gunpowder can we\nconsider improving it. This can be seen\nfrom the changes in gunpowder. Early\ngunpowder was a medicine. It was first\nrecorded by Sun Seao, the king of\nmedicine of the Tang Dynasty in his\nalchemical texts where he called it the\nsubduing fire with sulfur method. The\nyoung craftsman glanced at Wei Wu at\nthis point and seeing that we ws\nexpression did not change. He continued,\n\"The gunpowder recorded at that time was\nmade by mixing sulfur, real and salt\npeter, which is similar to but different\nfrom the gunpowder we use today. During\nthe northern song dynasty, the gunpowder\nformula changed again and medicinal\nmaterials such as akenite, wool spain,\nand heartbreaking grass were added as\nsuperfluous additions. The final\ncomposition becomes more complex, but\nthe power is less than satisfactory.\nWhen ignited, it may even produce thick\nsmoke and be toxic. Upon hearing this,\nWu showed no outward reaction, but\ninwardly he nodded in approval. It's\ncertain that this person had genuinely\nstudied gunpowder. Otherwise, he\ncouldn't have described it in such\ndetail. Just as Wayi Wu was looking\nforward to it, the young craftsman spoke\nup again. Over the next hundred years,\ncraftsmen continued to work on it and\nfinally removed those impurities which\nlaid the foundation for gunpowder as we\nknow it today. But I feel it's not\nenough. It should be further streamlined\nand improved, removing the unnecessary\nparts so that the gunpowder can become\npure. After the young craftsman finished\nspeaking, he stepped back into the group\nof three and then another young\ncraftsman stepped forward. Lord Chonglu,\nmy thoughts are similar, but I believe\nthat in addition to simplification, the\nproportions are also very important.\nWhether it's salt peter, arsenic, or\ntongue oil, the proportions need to be\ncarefully adjusted again. A petty person\nbelieves that simply removing other\ningredients without paying attention to\nquantity is a wrong path and will\nultimately lead one astray. The young\ncraftsman spoke more concisely unlike\nthe previous man who quoted extensively\nfrom classical texts. However, what he\nsaid was substantial and even crucial.\nIn fact, although the Ming dynasty had\ngunpowder, its gunpowder formula was\nriddled with flaws. Not only are the\nproportions wrong, but they also add\nsome strange and unusual ingredients.\nWhat made we woo even more ridiculous\nand sad was that gunpowder was clearly\ninvented by the Chinese. Ultimately, the\ngunpowder formula was transmitted to the\nJapanese pirates through the Portuguese\nand then to China. Only then were the\nbasic materials for gunpowder\ndetermined. Salt peter, sulfur, and\ncharcoal. Although the proportions were\nstill not perfect. So, the young\ncraftsman was right. The proportions are\nindeed one of the key factors. After the\ntwo young men had finished speaking, the\nmiddle-aged man finally spoke. My lord,\nregarding your question, I have actually\ntried to alter the gunpowder formula in\nprivate. Upon hearing this, Wayi Wu\nimmediately perked up. What those two\nyoung men said was indeed correct, but\nthey only stopped at that point in their\nthinking. But the middle-aged man in\nfront of me was putting his guesses into\npractice. This is exactly the spirit\nthat Chow Chow wanted. I have discovered\nthat the ash and gunpowder does not\nactually require a mixture of various\ntypes of wood. In fact, it would be more\ncomplicated to do so. Even without\nadding things like holoc, orange, or\nbamboo leaves, gunpowder can still be\nmade. There is no difference. Therefore,\nI believe that the current gunpowder is\nindeed imperfect and needs to be\nimproved first and then we should find a\nway to increase its power. Because of\nthe restrictions imposed by the Imperial\nCourt, we dare not act recklessly in\nprivate and we cannot arbitrarily change\nthe formulas in the Ordinance Bureau.\nSo, these are the only results we have\nat the moment. Upon hearing this, Wayiu\nimmediately understood that this was yet\nanother talented individual being\nsuppressed by someone like the old\ncraftsman. They wanted to improve and\ninnovate, but they couldn't do so within\nthe Ministry of Industry, and doing so\nprivately would violate the law.\nFortunately, such a talented person was\nsent to me, which allows him to explore\nand study freely. Thinking of this,\nWayiu immediately raised his hands and\nclapped. Clap clap clap. Seeing that we\nWoo was clapping, the other craftsmen\nalso joined in. The three craftsmen who\nwere researching firearms were stunned\nby what they saw. At this moment, we wu\nfinally spoke. You three all gave very\ngood answers. I'm very satisfied.\nWelcome to the Academy of Science and\nTechnology. Please have a seat. Awakened\nby Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s voice, the three of them\nfound their seats amidst applause from\nthe crowd, looking puzzled. Once they\nwere seated and he saw the expressions\non their faces, Weii Wu smiled and\nexplained, \"Don't be confused. The\nquestion I asked you just now wasn't to\nhear the answer, but to know your\nattitude.\" In this research institute,\nknowledge is important, but even more\nimportant is the attitude of breaking\nwith convention and daring to innovate.\nKnowledge can only determine how far you\ngo, but attitude can determine how high\nyou fly. You will understand this in the\nfuture. At this point, Wayi Wu paused as\nif to give him time to process what he\nhad said. After a while, he continued\nspeaking. \"Now, I'll answer the question\nI just asked you. Is the gunpowder ratio\nperfect, or is there room for\nimprovement?\" As you said, the answer is\nnot perfect. In fact, it is full of\nflaws and needs to be improved before it\ncan be perfected. And the most standard\nratio of gunpowder, listen carefully, is\nat 75% salt peter, 10% sulfur, and 15%\ncharcoal ground in a powder and mixed\ntogether. At this point, we was actually\nquite helpless. When a gunpowder formula\nreturned to China, the proportions were\nnever precise. 80% salt peter, 1%\nsulfur, and 1% charcoal. This method was\nused until the lateqing dynasty.\nFortunately, with him here, the\ngunpowder has reached the standard\nspecifications ahead of schedule, and we\ncan start considering optimization and\nimprovement later. The things added to\ngunpowder nowadays only affect its power\nand can all be removed. Of course, I\ndon't mean that nothing can be added to\ngunpowder. It's permissible to add\nthings as long as the proportions aren't\ndisrupted. At this point, a playful\nsmile appeared on Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s face. In\nfact, some things added to gunpowder can\nmake it even more powerful. Chapter 111.\nAnother imperial edict arrives. Eternal\njoy unending. Wayi Wu had assumed the\nthree men would be curious about what\ncould make Gunpowder more powerful.\nHowever, when he looked up, he found\nthat the three people's eyes were filled\nwith more doubt and uncertainty. Only\nthen did Wayi Wu realized that talking\nwas useless. These three people have\njust arrived at the Academy of Sciences\nand haven't seen their methods before,\nso whatever they say isn't very\ncredible. Seeing this, we wu decided to\ntry a different approach. Seang, does\nour institute have any materials in\nreserve for making gunpowder? Yes, Vice\nDean. Very good. How someone send the\nmaterials over? After speaking, Wayi Wu\nlooked at the middle-aged man among the\nthree firearms craftsmen. May I have\nyour name? Reporting to the vice dean,\n\"My name is Yong Chiao.\" Weiiwa nodded,\nthen continued, \"The materials will be\ndelivered soon. You will make the\ngunpowder according to the proportions I\ntold you, and then they will make the\ngunpowder according to tradition.\" As he\nspoke, Wei Wu pointed to the other two\nyoung craftsmen. The materials were\ndelivered shortly afterward, and the\nthree firearms craftsmen began making\ngunpowder on their own. Since it was\njust an experiment, there was no need to\nproduce too many. At Wei Wu's\ninstruction, each side produced 2 oz.\nThen they found a bamboo tube, tamped\nthe gunpowder into it, inserted into the\nfuse, and then sealed the bamboo tube.\nTwo firecrackers, each containing 2 oz\nof gunpowder, were then made. To be\nhonest, even Woo felt a chill down his\nspine when he saw this thing. In later\ngenerations, firecrackers only contained\n8 g of gunpowder. Yet that power was\nenough to sever several fingers. In the\nMing dynasty, one gene was 16 leong,\nwhich was equivalent to 596 g in later\ntimes. Therefore, one leong was about 37\ng. That means that the amount of\ngunpowder filled in these two bamboo\ntubes now exceeds 70 g. If this thing\nexplodes, anyone standing even slightly\nclose will get injured. To ensure\nsafety, Wayi Wu immediately ordered two\npits to be dug in a yard outside the\nhouse. The hole was just the right size\nto fit the bamboo tube inside. Yang Xiao\nfirst bury the firecrackers made with\ntraditional gunpowder in the pit, then\nignite them and see how powerful they\nare. Gunpowder is a very dangerous\nsubstance, but Yong Chow, as a firearms\ncraftsman, would have no problem\nhandling it. Underway Woos instructions,\nYang Xiao immediately buried the\nfirecrackers. Once he was sure the\nothers were far enough away, he took out\na tinder box, lit the fuse, and then\nquickly ran back into the house. Boom!\nAn explosion rang out, and bluish green\nsmoke rose from the crater before slowly\ndissipating. Only then did the people\ninside go out to check, and they saw\nthat the small crater had been blown up\nto the size of a human head. Wei Wu\nglanced at it and then led his men back\ninto the main house. He then had Yong\nChow light a second firecracker. After\ncarefully repeating the same operation,\nYong Chow ran back to the main house.\nBoom. Because the gunpowder was\nprecisely proportioned and there were no\nother inexplicable impurities mixed in.\nThis explosion was significantly louder\nthan the previous firecracker. Just\nhearing this noise gives one a strong\nsense of crisis that shakes one's mind\nafter the bluish green smoke in the\ncourtyard dissipated again. The group\nwent to check the second pit. Weii Wu\nwasn't surprised, but the three\ncraftsmen stared blankly at the pit.\nWhat was originally a hole the size of\nfirecracker has now become the size of a\nwash basin. The difference may not seem\nthat big, but the three craftsmen\nunderstood the difference. This is the\nsame amount of gunpowder and the soil\naround the pit is also the same. The\ngunpowder made using Weii Wu's formula\nwas several times more powerful than\ntraditional gunpowder. The key point is\nthat Wayi Woo did not interfere with the\nentire process from production to\ndetonation. So, there is no possibility\nof cheating. That only proves one thing.\nWayi Wu's formula was indeed better and\nstronger. After the experiment was\ncompleted, everyone returned to the main\nhouse. Having witnessed the facts\nfirsthand, the three firearms craftsmen\nlooked at Wayi Wu as if he were their\nancestor, Yong Xiao was restless in his\nchair, wanted to get up and ask\nsomething, but worried that he would be\ntoo rash. Seeing this, we wu smiled and\ncalled out his name. Yong Xiao, you seem\nto have something to say. Yes. Yes,\nBene. I would like to ask you what you\njust said about adding to make it more\npowerful. I do know this, but I don't\nwant to tell you. I want you to find it\nout yourselves. At this point, Wayi Woo\nadded another sentence. Don't be fixated\non any particular medicinal herb. Try\nother things such as minerals, food, or\neven seasonings. Let's set the time\nframe at 3 months. If you can find it\nyourselves, I'll personally give you 50\ntales of silver as a reward. Of course,\nI won't let you search blindly. I will\nbe giving lectures during this time. So,\nremember to listen attentively and take\nnotes. Perhaps you can find the answer\nfrom the knowledge I've shared. Also,\nthe same goes for the construction team.\nUpon hearing Weii Wu mention a reward of\n50 tales of silver, the craftsmen all\nlooked at the three with envy. However,\nWayi Wu would not show favoritism and\nwould naturally give them a chance to\nreceive a reward. Construction team,\nI'll give you a recipe. Clay, quick\nlime, and gypsum calsigned and then\nground in a powder with iron powder\nadded. We can make something called\ncement which is mixed with fine sand and\nwater and after it solidifies it is not\nonly strong but also durable. I'll give\nyou the recipe but I hope you'll figure\nout the exact proportions and amount\nyourselves. This process of discovery is\nvery important for you. Actually it\nwouldn't be wrong for we woo to say it\ndirectly but that would make the\ncraftsman lazy which would not be\nconducive to long-term development. Like\nnow we give them a solution to study and\nat the same time we involve some related\nknowledge when we teach. Let them solve\nproblems through exploration and\nlearning. This is the healthy way to\ndevelop. Of course the main reason for\nthis allocation was to give the\nconstruction team and the three firearm\nspecialist something to do. After\nassigning tasks to them, we will looked\nat the carpenters and blacksmiths who\nare also looking forward to the task.\nThe carpenters group and the blacksmith\ngroup should focus on making a steam\nengine. Once it is completed, you will\nall receive a reward. After making\narrangements for each group, we woo\ncontinued his lecture. For the next 2\ndays, Weii Wu shuttled between his home\nand the Academy of Sciences every day.\nThat morning, just as Wei Wu was about\nto begin his lecture to the craftsman,\nthere was a slightly urgent knocking at\nthe door. reporting to the Earl of Chong\nLu. His majesty has issued an imperial\nedict. Please receive it immediately.\nUpon hearing this, Wayi Wu looked\npuzzled. What is Old Yu up to? Why did\nhe suddenly issue another imperial edict\nto me? With his doubts in mind, Wayi Wu\ncame out of the main house, followed\nclosely by the craftsman. As soon as he\ncame out, Wei Wu saw his old\nacquaintance, Unic Wong, holding the\nImperial Edict with a smile on his face.\nWhen he saw Weii Wu, he grinned and\nopened the imperial edict. Everyone\nknelt down except for Wei Wu, who\nremained standing. By the grace of\nheaven, the emperor decrees as heaven\nand earth give birth to life, and En and\nYang are formed. My three daughters have\nbeen intelligent and quick-witted since\nchildhood, virtuous and gentle,\noutstanding in appearance and character,\nand gentle and virtuous. Now that they\nhave reached marriageable age, I hereby\nbestow upon them the title of Wei Yong.\nNow there is a wise and capable marquee\nof Chonglu Wei Wu who is both talented\nand virtuous with a dignified, bearing,\nand extensive knowledge of the past and\npresent. He is a perfect match for me.\nHe is also compatible with my three\ndaughters in character. It is truly a\nmatch made in heaven. With this in mind,\nI hereby bestow this marriage upon the\ntwo of you. The Imperial Clan Corps has\nselected an auspicious date of May 11th\nto unite you in marriage and pledge your\nlifelong vows. I hope you will treat\neach other with respect and have many\ndescendants. This is my decree. Chapter\n112. The marriage was arranged so\nsuddenly. Happiness came so\nunexpectedly. A marriage decreed by\nimperial decree. Before receiving the\nimperial decree, we wu considered many\npossibilities, but he never expected it\nto be a marriage decree. Moreover, his\nown title of Earl was Chonglu, while the\ntitle that old Jew gave to Yushien was\nWei Yong. Changen means lasting joy and\nWei Yang means endless and never ending.\nTogether, they form the phrase eternal\nhappiness, demonstrating that Emperor\nXu's bestowal of this title was a\nwell-considered decision. If you do the\nmath, there are only 14 days left until\nthe wedding day. This is my first time\ngetting married, and I have no\nexperience at all. What should I do? The\nthought of getting married in just over\n10 days made Weii Wu, a guy who had\nnever been in a relationship, nervous.\nLord Chonglu, Lord Chonglu, it's time to\nreceive the imperial decree. Just as\nWeii Wu&lt;unk&gt;s thoughts were wandering,\nhe suddenly heard the voice of Unuang.\nWhen he came to his senses, he realized\nthat Uni Wuang was looking at him with a\nkind smile. However, since they were all\nold acquaintances, Wayi Wu didn't mind\nand walked up to them with a big laugh.\nI'm sorry. I'm sorry. This is my first\ntime, so I may have been a little out of\nline. After receiving the imperial edict\nfrom Unic Wang, Wayi Wu read it\ncarefully again, feeling extremely\npleased. He people are in high spirits\nwhen they have a happy occasion. It's\nnormal for the prince consort to be\nabsent-minded. Weii Wu was a little\nunaccustomed to being called the\nimperial son-in-law, but felt quite\nnice. In the past, when Unic Wong came\nto deliver Imperial edicts, Chow Chow\nwould always be kind and give him a\nsmall gift. Today was no exception. But\njust as he was about to get his things,\nhe noticed that Uni Wongs expression was\na little strange. The two had always had\na good relationship, and the other party\nhad helped them not long ago, so Weii Wu\nsimply asked directly. Yun Wong were old\nacquaintances, so please feel free to\nspeak your mind. Upon hearing wei\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s words, a hint of embarrassment\nflashed across Unwangs, but he still\nspoke up. \"Actually, I wanted to ask\nyour highness. The one you gave me last\ntime is very convenient, so I'd like to\nbuy some more. There's one more thing in\nmy humble opinion.\" Wong Gong Gong\nstopped halfway through his sentence,\nand Wei Wu immediately chimed in. \"Oh,\nyou mean this? Yes, yes, I still have\nsome, but it would be too formal to talk\nabout buying it. I consider my\nfather-in-law a friend. To be honest,\nWayiu didn't expect that Unic Wong\nactually wanted to ask him for this\nitem. If Unic Wong hadn't suddenly\nbrought it up, he would have forgotten\nthat he had specially sent this thing as\na gift last time. But to be honest, it\nwas indeed something very suitable for\nUnix. As for the inventory, Wayi Woo\ndoes have some. He opened a whole box of\nthem when he was opening blind boxes\nfrom Express Delivery before. last time\nbecause the bundle had limited capacity.\nWe only managed to pack less than a\nthird of what was intended for Unic\nWong. Anyway, this thing is completely\nuseless to him. So, he doesn't care if\nhe gives it all away. Moreover, it was\nclear that Unic Wong had something to\nsay to him. So, Wei Wu simply went along\nwith it and said, \"But I didn't bring\nthis with me, and I'm not in the mood\nfor class today anyway. Let's go back to\nthe manor to get it.\" Upon hearing Weii\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s reply, Unic Wong&lt;unk&gt;s face\nimmediately lit up with joy. However, he\nwas also worried that he might affect\nWeii Wu since his majesty attached great\nimportance to the affairs of the Academy\nof Sciences. Just as Unic Wong was\npondering this, we wu directly led him\naway from the Academy of Sciences. Upon\nreturning to his residence, Wayi Wu\nimmediately went to his room and when he\ncame out again, he was carrying a box in\nhis arms. These are the remaining stock.\nUnic can take them all back. Just leave\nthe boxes with me. After saying that,\nWayi Wu placed the cardboard box on the\nground. In that case, I thank your\nhighness for the reward. Upon hearing we\nsay that these were all his own, Yun\nWong quickly bowed and then glanced down\nat them. This was quite a sight. After\nseeing it, Yun Wong immediately peed\nhimself. And he really did. Fortunately,\nhe was wearing the diapers that we woo\nhad given him before. So even if he\npeed, it wouldn't have any effect. At\nthat moment, the way Wong Gong Gong\nlooked at those diapers softened\nconsiderably. Then in front of Wayi Wu,\nhe took out a cloth bundle from his\nbosom, the kind that was quite large.\nHowever, it's still a bit difficult to\ncarry all the diapers away with just\nthis bag. However, Unic Wong ignored\nthem and forcefully stuffed them all\ninto the bundle. After rising, Yun Wong\nthanked Wei Wu again, then slowly\nstepped forward and said softly, \"My\nlord, I heard something in the palace.\"\nSome time ago, his highness Prince Sheen\nwas summoned back to the palace and was\nsubsequently severely punished by his\nmajesty. A few days ago, news came from\nthe Imperial Medical Academy that his\nhighness Prince Sheen was cursing every\nday, saying that he wanted to find the\nperson who framed him and tear him to\npieces. His Highness Prince Chen's\ninjuries have improved considerably in\nthe past few days, and he has returned\nto his residence, but he still goes to\nthe palace every day. Upon hearing this,\nWayi Wu couldn't help but find it\namusing. King Zhuang Aqin was looking\nfor him. Although she told Zhu Yuan Jang\nabout the prince herself, it couldn't be\nsaid that she had framed him. Aside from\nthings that haven't happened yet, he was\ncompletely innocent in everything else.\nHe brought it all upon himself. If\nnothing unexpected happens, Zhu Xwang\nhasn't found out who it is yet.\nOtherwise, given his temper, he would\nhave already come knocking on their\ndoor. Just as Wei Wu was deep in\nthought, the voice of Unic Wong came\nfrom the side again. Your Highness, his\nmajesty, had a long talk with you in the\nFian Hall that day and afterwards issued\nan edict ordering the Prince of Chin to\nreturn to the capital. Many palace\nservants know about this. This matter\nprobably can't be kept secret any\nlonger. you might as well make some\npreparations and seek out his majesty or\nhis highness the crown prince to avoid\nany misunderstandings.\nAfter Unic Wong finished speaking, Wayi\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s response was merely a faint\nsmile without the slightest hint of\nworry. Even though there were rumors\nthat the king ofQen, the head of the\nnine kings guarding the border,\npossessed astonishing marshall prowess\nand military talent that was no less\nthan that of the generals in the court.\nHowever, the king ofQen was, after all,\nZhu&lt;unk&gt;s son and also the second\nbrother of his fianceé. It's definitely\nimpossible to kill him. We&lt;unk&gt;ll\nprobably have to use a stun gun to\nfinish him off. After pondering for a\nmoment, Wayi Wu looked at Unic Wang. I'm\naware of this matter, and I must thank\nUnic Wong for passing on the message to\nme. Otherwise, I really wouldn't have\nbeen able to take any precautions. I\ndare not. It is my honor to be able to\nhelp the prince consort. Once this\nmatter is settled, I will return to the\npalace to report to his majesty. Upon\nhearing this, we simply accompanied him\nto the door. After exchanging a few\npleasantries, Yun Wuang turned and left,\nand Wayi Wu also prepared to go back to\nhis room to rest. However, at that\nmoment, he suddenly saw Jean Hao walking\ntowards his residence with a worried\nlook on his face. As he walked, he was\ntalking to his subordinates, and judging\nfrom his expression, he was probably\nscolding them. Just then, seeing Wei Wu\nabout to return to his residence, Jean\nHao immediately joged forward and bowed.\nGreetings, your excellency. All right,\nstop being so polite. By the way, what's\nwrong? You looked so worried earlier.\nUpon hearing Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s question, Jean\nHao immediately let out a long sigh.\nAlas, my lord, I am incompetent. Of the\ntwo assassins who tried to kill you last\ntime, the skinny one died in prison.\nDead? Surely the people who carried out\nthe executions in your cell aren't that\nbad. Your excellency, you've\nmisunderstood. We didn't kill him. The\nguy killed himself. By the time we\nrealized it, it was too late. Chapter\n113. This isn't just a ruthless person.\nHe's a wolf in sheep's clothing. After\nhearing Jean Ha&lt;unk&gt;s answer, Wayi Wu\nwas stunned and didn't react for a\nmoment. What does it mean to kill\nyourself? Yes, there are many ways to\nend one's life, but those are all when\none is free. Those two assassins were\nimprisoned in the imperial prison, and\nthey were imprisoned for assassinating\nWeii Woo. Leaving aside Weii Wu&lt;unk&gt;s\nimportance in the hearts of the emperor\nand the crown prince, his relationship\nwith the embroidered uniform guard was\nincredibly close. It should be noted\nthat Maang, the commander of the\nembroidered uniform guard, still owed\nhim a favor, and the two had a fairly\ngood relationship. These two guys won't\neven get to sleep in a cell. They'll be\ntied to the rack right away. Wayu\ncouldn't fathom how he managed to end\nhis own life with all four limbs bound.\nAfter regaining his senses, filled with\ncuriosity, we wu couldn't help but ask a\nquestion. He said he killed himself.\nHow'd he do it? Was it poison? Jean Hao\nshook his head and then explained, \"No,\nyour excellency, you don't know.\nEveryone who enters the imperial prison\nis subjected to strict testing and even\nthe back of the body is not spared. Only\nafter ensuring they don't carry anything\nand can't pull any tricks will they be\nput into prison and tortured. After\nsaying that, Jean Ha saw that way. Wu\nlooked very curious. So, he immediately\nopened up to answer his question. My\nlord, you don't need to guess anymore.\nI'll just tell you directly. That guy\nbit off his own tongue and that's how he\ndied. Huh? No, wait a minute. As far as\nI know, biting your tongue won't kill\nyou unless you choke on blood. Could he\nhave suffocated? At this point, Wayi Wu\nimmediately shook his head, denying his\nown guess. No, that doesn't make sense.\nIf he were suffocating, you would\ndefinitely have intervened and wouldn't\nhave let him die like that. Yes, these\ntwo assassins are guarded around the\nclock. If anything happens, we will\ndefinitely stop them. At this point,\nJean Ho's eyes were filled with\nhelplessness. But that person is like a\nmadman. I had only heard that the White\nLotus sect had methods of bewitching\npeople before, but now I have seen it\nfor myself. My lord, you have no idea.\nThat fellow bled to death right in front\nof their guards. The more Jeango spoke,\nthe more confused Way Wu became, even\nstarting to doubt whether the guy had a\nproblem with his communication skills.\nHe bled to death right in front of his\nguards, but they didn't even notice.\nCould it be that all this blood is\ninvisible? or but does it simply\nevaporate and disappear upon contact\nwith air? Although he was puzzled, we wu\ndid not press the matter further and\nwaited for Jeangha to continue. Sure\nenough, Jean Hao continued, \"Your\nExcellency, you have no idea how utterly\ndepraved that guy was. He bit off his\nown tongue and swallowed it. We only\nfound out later when the coroner\nperformed the autopsy that he had drunk\nhis own blood and died from it. Holy\ncrap. Is this something a human could\ndo?\" Upon hearing Jean Hao's answer,\nWayiu immediately thought of the\nsentence. He bit off his own tongue and\ndrank his own blood. And the key point\nis that he didn't let the guards find\nout. In other words, the person did all\nof this while maintaining a completely\nexpressionless face. This isn't just\nruthless. This is ruthless slayer.\nHowever, at this moment, we woo\nremembered that guy named Wong Gang. By\nthe way, the skinny one died. What about\nthe strong one? Did something happen to\nhim, too? The moment Wong Gang was\nmentioned, Jean Hao immediately wore an\nexpression of extreme headache. No, that\nguy's fine. In fact, he's gone mad with\nanger, cursing the person who bit his\ntongue. The implication is that the\nperson ended his own life, and without\nthe protection of his mother, he could\nnot return to his hometown of emptiness.\nWe felt he probably wouldn't do the same\nthing again, but just in case, we still\nhad his tooth pulled. After saying that,\nJeang houseide again, raised his hand to\nrub his temples, and then continued. No\nmatter what methods we used to torture\nhim, his mouth was as if it were sewn\nshut, and he just wouldn't open his\nmouth no matter what. That bastard\npractices external martial arts. His\nwillpower far surpasses that of ordinary\npeople, and he keeps chanting strange\nscriptures. We've used every available\nform of torture that doesn't take a\nlife, but it's had absolutely no effect.\nAt this point, Jean Hao couldn't help\nbut slowly shake his head. The White\nLotus Cult, that damn cult is truly\nterrifying. How could they possibly\nbewitch people to this extent? After\nJean Hao finished speaking, Weii Wu\ncouldn't help but frown. In other words,\nafter 2 days, apart from the death of\none assassin, the embroidered uniform\nguard had gained absolutely nothing. But\nWeii Wu could understand. In truth, this\noutcome couldn't really be blamed on\nJean Hao and his men's incompetence.\nThis person is clearly a fanatic.\nFanatics are extremely fanatical,\npossessing an intensely fervent faith in\na particular religion or deity. They\nwill use radical, extreme, or even crazy\nmethods to defend their beliefs. It's\nimpossible to make them submit unless\nyou can break their beliefs. But that's\nmuch harder than submission. If their\nbeliefs were so easily shattered, they\nwouldn't be called fanatics. However, in\nWei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s view, there was still some\nhope in breaking the faith. If it were a\nfanatical believer like those of later\ngenerations, Chow Chow would have been\ncompletely helpless. But this was the\nMing dynasty. For these ancient people\nwho had never seen much of the world, in\nparticular for ancient people who firmly\nbelieved in the existence of gods,\nsimply demonstrating some miracles would\nhave a miraculous effect. Having formed\nan idea, Wayi Wu immediately looked at\nJean Hao and said, \"Actually, I do have\na way that might get him to talk, but it\nwould require the cooperation of many\npeople.\" Jean Ha, who is still worried,\nimmediately looked up at Wei Wu upon\nhearing this. He didn't know much about\nWei Woo, but he did know that we woo had\nsome very peculiar methods and weapons.\nThere's really nothing he can do about\nthat guy in the cell. Now, hearing Wayi\nWu say that he could handle it. The\nanticipation in his eyes was almost\noverflowing. My lord, just tell me what\nyou need me to do and I will make sure\neveryone cooperates with you. Upon\nhearing this, we wu smiled mysteriously\nand then gave his requirements. Here's\nwhat we'll do. Go to the temples around\nthe capital and find me a h 100red monks\nwho can chant scriptures in Sanskrit.\nDon't let that guy in the cell sleep.\nKeep him constantly exhausted to wear\ndown his will. Also find a slightly\nlarger cell and decorate it according to\nmy requirements, making the walls white.\nHao nodded as he noted Wayi Wu&lt;unk&gt;s\nrequest, then asked another question. My\nlord, besides these, is there anything\nelse you need my help with? That's all.\nI'll take care of the rest. You go find\na monk first and let me know when you've\nmade the arrangements. After Wei Wu\nfinished speaking, Jean Hgho didn't\nwaste any more words and immediately\nleft with his men. After he left, Weii\nWu went straight back to his room, took\nout his phone, and started Black Myth on\nhis PS5. Chapter 114. Giving money would\nbe an insult to the eminent monks. When\nWayi Woo activated wind spirit moon\nshadow last time, he still managed to\nsave face a little. Although he enabled\nmost of the features, he did not enable\nthe one-hit kill feature. But now he\nneeds to clear the level quickly. So he\nhas no choice but to activate this most\noutrageous feature. Subsequently,\nwhenever a boss animation appeared, Wayi\nwould immediately pick up his phone and\nrecord the level completion animation as\nsource material. Even with the wind\nspirit moon shadow activated and\npossessing the divine skill of onehit\nkill, it still took several hours to\nfinish. After turning off the PS5, Wayi\nWu nestled on the sofa and began\nselecting suitable materials bit by bit.\nBy the time he had made his selections,\nJean Hao had already returned. My lord,\nI have found 100 monks who understand\nSanskrit and arranged for them to wait\nin the main hall of the heavenly temple.\nIn addition, the cell has been prepared\nand all four walls have been painted\nwhite as he requested. Upon hearing\nthis, Wayi Wu nodded, stood up, and\nstretched vigorously. All right, let's\ngo then. After leaving the mansion, the\ntwo took a carriage and arrived at Tinja\nTemple as quickly as possible. Inside\nthe main hall, we wu just stepped in\nwhen he saw hundreds of monks\nmeditating. However, these monks did not\nrecognize Weii Wu. They only knew that\nJean Ha had sent them. Upon seeing Jang\nhowo enter the main hall, a monk\nimmediately stood up and quickly came to\ngreet him. Lord Jang, I have summoned\nall the monks who understand Sanskrit as\nyou requested. What are your\ninstructions? Just as the monk finished\nspeaking, Jean Hao waved his hand.\nMaster Kongwi, it's not that I have any\norders, but Chong Lebo needs the help of\nall the monks. After speaking, Jean Hao\nturned around and introduced him to\nMaster Kongwi. This is Marque Wei of\nChong Lu, his majesty's chosen consort,\nwho will soon be married to Princess Wei\nYang. Weii didn't know what Jeang Hao\nmeant either. Wouldn't it have been\nbetter to just mention his own title?\nWhy did he have to deliberately reveal\nhis status as the prince consort? Was it\nreally necessary for him to put on such\na show in front of the monk? However,\njust as he was thinking this, Master\nKongwi suddenly turned around and looked\nat him with a warm expression. It is the\nImperial son-in-law and\ncommanderin-chief who have graced our\nheavenly realm temple with their\npresence. We are truly honored seeing\nthe monks appearance. Wayi Wu seemed to\nsee the shadow of those holy monks and\nlater generations who would embrace\nbeautiful women and drive luxury cars.\nBefore Wei Wu could speak, Master Kongwi\ncontinued, \"I wonder what business the\nImperial son-in-law has that requires\nthe help of us monks.\" After master\nKongwi finished speaking, we would\ndidn't keep him in suspense and\nimmediately revealed his purpose. I hope\nthat all the masters can chant the\nscriptures together in Sanskrit. The\nrequirements are that it must be done in\nunison and solemnly and also pay\nattention to the inonation accent. After\nhearing Wu&lt;unk&gt;s request, Master Kung\nHui's expression became somewhat\npuzzled. He understood the neat and\nsolemn tone, but he couldn't figure out\nwhat it meant by this tone. Seeing this\nWayi Wu simply offered another\nexplanation. The essence of style is to\nhave that mysterious quality that makes\npeople fall into it. No, it should be\nsaid that it's the kind of quality that\nmakes people bewitch. It makes people\nfeel as if they have seen a god descend\nto earth. The kind of piety. Upon\nhearing this, Master Kong, we understood\nwhat way we wanted. It's nothing more\nthan pretending to be a god to deepen\npeople's faith. He's an expert at this\nbusiness. I understand what you mean.\nSo, what do you think we should start?\nShould we change seats? No need. It's\nfine right here in the main hall. The\nspace here is large enough to create an\necho, which will make the effect even\nbetter. Seeing Weii Wu say this, Master\nKong Wii stopped asking questions and\nimmediately returned to the monks. Under\nMaster Kong Hui's arrangement, chanting\nimmediately filled the Great Buddha\nHall. Weii Wu quickly took out his phone\nand started recording. Unfortunately,\nafter the first recitation of the\nscripture, Wayi Wu immediately replayed\nit to check the recording quality. It\nhas to be said that it was very moving,\nbut you could clearly hear that the\nmonk's chanting was not in sync. So,\nChow Chow immediately summoned Master\nKongwi and asked them to recite it\nagain. And so, they did it again and\nagain until the monk's voices became on\nthe eighth try. But perhaps because his\nvoice was horsearo, he felt particularly\nmoved by the scripture this time. and\nWayi Wu immediately decided on it in\nhigh spirits. Weii Wu casually took out\na few coins of silver and handed them to\nMaster Kong Hoi. You have all worked\nvery hard this time. I know that you\nmonks are all virtuous and eminent monks\nwho are free from desires and have\nrenounced worldly attachments. If I were\nto offer several hundred or even a\nthousand tales of silver, wouldn't that\nbe an insult to the eminent monks?\nAlthough I am but a layman, I know my\nlimits. I can only add a little money\nfor incense to express my feelings, to\npreserve everyone's reputation, and to\nmake myself seem less vulgar and\nmaterialistic. Upon hearing Weii\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s words, the entire great Buddha\nHall fell silent. Master Kong Hwi and\nhundreds of monks along with Jean Ha,\nwho came with Wei Wu all stared at him\nwith wide eyes. Seeing this, Weii Wu\ndidn't even wait for Master Kong Hui to\nrefuse before stuffing the silver into\nhis hand. Then under everyone's gaze, he\nturned and left gracefully. It was only\nat this moment that Jean Hao finally\nreacted, turned around and put his hands\ntogether in prayer towards Master\nConway. He left with an apologetic\nsmile, then quickly ran out of the main\nhall and chased after Wei Wu until the\ntwo left Tinja Temple. The main hall\nremained as quiet as a ghost town.\nHundreds of monks looked at each other\nand then all eyes were focused on Master\nKongwi. The reason is simple. Since\nMaster Kongwi summoned them here, they\nnaturally need to find the person who\nsummoned them. Being stared at by\nhundreds of eyes, Master Kongwei felt as\nif hundreds of steel knives were pointed\nat him. Beneath his round, bald head was\na face as black as a rag that had been\nused for over a decade. He never\nexpected that after everything was done,\nWayi Woo, the son-in-law, would pull\nsuch a stunt on him. Even if you're\nasking them to perform a religious\nceremony, you shouldn't just give him a\nfew coins and send them away. However,\nit's no use what he says now. Wayiw has\nalready left. Even if he hadn't left,\nhis status as a nobleman and the\nemperor's son-in-law meant he was\nsomeone they couldn't afford to offend.\nIn the end, these people will still come\nafter him. Feeling frustrated, Master\nKongwei had no choice but to speak up.\nEveryone, I will have someone deliver\nthe personnel later. Thank you for your\nhard work this time. Just as Master Kong\nHwi finished speaking, a burst of\nlaughter suddenly rang out in the\nMahavara Hall. The crowd looked in the\ndirection of the sound and saw that the\nperson laughing was a monk wearing a\nblack robe. Master Kongwi was already\nseething with anger and now he heard\nthis laughter that was clearly mocking.\nEven Buddhas have tempers. He\nimmediately questioned them in a cold\nvoice. Dian, why are you laughing? I\njust suddenly remembered something\nhappy. What's the good news? It seems\nlike my pet yellow dog is about to have\npuppies, so I'm happy. You hump? Upon\nhearing Dian's reply, Master Kongwe\ncould say nothing more and simply\nsnorted and looked away. Seeing that\nMaster Kong Wii was no longer pressing\nthe matter, the black robed monk turned\nto look outside the main hall. He stared\nintently in the direction way Wu had\nleft, muttering to himself. I've never\nseen such a peculiar aura and facial\nfeatures before. Interesting. Really\ninteresting. He Chapter 115.\nUnexpectedly, Jean Hao with his thick\neyebrows and big eyes was actually a\ntight trope walker. After leaving the\nmain hall, Jean Hao quickly caught up\nwith Wei Wu, who was walking hurriedly.\nAfter hesitating for a long time behind\nhim, I finally couldn't help but ask him\ncautiously, \"My lord, do you have some\nkind of grudge against that monk?\" \"No,\nthey are monks, and I have never been to\nTinga Temple before, so how could we\nhave any grudges?\" Upon hearing Wei\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s answer, Jango&lt;unk&gt;s eyes\nclearly showed some suspicion. But just\nas he was about to speak again, he heard\nWei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s voice. Master Kongwi was a\nhighly virtuous monk who had renounced\nthe four elements of greed, anger, and\nignorance. He would not have the love,\nhatred, and grudges of an ordinary\nperson. I'm just an ordinary mortal. How\ncould anyone hold a grudge against me?\nIf that were the case, wouldn't I be\nbreaking the Buddhist precept against\nanger? That's true, but after listening\nto Wayi Wu&lt;unk&gt;s words, Jean Hao felt\nthat something was off. Moreover, Wayi\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s tone of voice was not just\nseemingly, but very obviously\nstraightforward and clear. He would\nnever believe it if you told him there\nwas no personal grudge, but it was\nobviously not a good time to ask now.\nDid Wei Woo and Master Kong Hi have any\npersonal grudges? The answer is no. And\nhe also has no aversion of Buddhism.\nAlthough there is the monk Shiriding who\nwears a monk's robe during the day and\nblack stockings at night, there is also\nthe compassionate and bodhisike master\nsuchan. What he did just now was simply\nbecause he was annoyed with Kong Hui and\nwanted to vent his anger on his past\nself. Before he traveled through time,\nwe wu had visited a local temple, hoping\nto pray to Buddha to help him find a\npartner. No sooner had he come out of\nthe Aroot Hall than a monk grabbed him\nand insisted on telling his fortune. As\na result, after spending 200 yuan, I\nreceived the answer. Today is a day of\ncalamity. Be careful to avoid disaster.\nThis guy took the money, and now he\nwon't even say anything nice to fool\nhim. If that were all, it would be fine.\nBut the worst part is that he ran into\nthe monk again during his late night\nsnack. He was dressed in a suit and tie,\nwearing a gold watch and gold chain,\ndriving a BMW, and had his arm around a\ntall, slender woman with long legs and\nblack stockings. At first, Waywood\ndidn't recognize him either. It was just\nthat this guy had drunk too much and was\nacting crazy while having a late night\nsnack. He got carried away with a\nbeautiful woman in black stockings, but\nlost his balance and knocked over Weey\nWoo's halfeaten midnight snack. Can we\ntolerate this? He immediately stood up\nto argue with the other party, but they\nended up fighting over a disagreement\nand he was no match for the other party.\nThe result was that the calculation was\ndamn accurate. This money was definitely\nwell spent. After leaving the Tangia\ntemple, the two rode in a carriage to\nthe Ginui prison. I went into the cell\nand took a look. All four walls were\npainted white and the cell was quite\nlarge. In the middle of the cell, there\nwas a set of table and chairs. After\nconfirming that everything was all\nright, Weii Wu took out a walkie-talkie.\nAfter handing the walkie-talkie to Jean\nHao, Wei Wu asked again, \"Does anyone in\nthe embroidered uniform guard know those\ntricks of the martial arts world? Those\nsupernatural feats? Those voice changing\ntricks?\" Upon hearing Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s\nquestion, Jean Ho immediately laughed.\n\"My lord, is this what you mean?\" When\nJean Hao spoke, the voice that came out\nof his mouth was actually a high-pitched\nfemale voice. Just as Wei Wu was\nshocked. He heard Jean Hao speak again.\nOr are you referring to this kind or\nthis kind? I know quite a lot of things.\nAfter that, Jean Hao spoke in a\ndifferent tone for each sentence. There\nare men, women, young and old, and they\ncan even make sounds that sound like\nmonsters. Who would have thought? Jean\nHao, you with your thick eyebrows and\nbig eyes are actually a deadbeat. Seeing\nway Wu&lt;unk&gt;s surprised expression, Jehoa\nsmiled and offered an explanation. To be\nhonest, your excellency, I once learned\nthe art of automatopia from a\nventriloquist. After Jean Hao finished\nspeaking, Weii Wu suddenly realized that\nthis truly proved the saying that there\nwas a skilled ventriloquist in the\ncapital. Then, filled with curiosity,\nWei Wu couldn't help but speak up again.\nHey, Jean Ha, I'm going to say\nsomething, and you have to repeat it in\na sweet, girish voice. I bought a little\nwindmill. Auba.\nJean Hao looked at Wei Wu with a strange\nexpression and then instinctively leaned\nback, making Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s face turn red.\nAfter a long silence, Wei Wu cough\ntwice.\nWell, let me teach you. With this\nwalkie-talkie, you can talk by simply\npressing and holding this position. He\nexplained how to use the walkie-talkie\nand then let Jeangha try it out himself.\nThe eerie atmosphere in the cell finally\ndissipated due to the shock and the\nwalkie-talkie's amazing function.\ncarefully holding the walkie-talkie in\nhis hand, Jean Ho looked at Wayi Wu\nagain and asked a question. My lord,\nwhat do you intend for me to do? Weii Wu\nchuckled and then said, \"It's simple.\nYou just hide outside the cell and keep\nan eye on my conversation with that guy.\nAs long as I say I'll make the god\nspeak, it'll be your turn to use the\nwalkie-talkie.\" As for what to say, I\ndon't need to teach you, do I? Having\nworked in the embroidered uniform guard,\nJean Hoa is quite confident in his\nability to adapt. Seeing Jean Hao nod,\nWeii Wu also smiled. Then bring them\nhere. Today we'll put on a show of\nsummoning the gods in Chong Lebo&lt;unk&gt;s\nprison and outsmarting the white lotus\nco heretics. Jean Hao laughed along with\nhim. Then turned around to make\narrangements. After he left, Weii Wu\nwent into the cell, placed the projector\nbehind the chair, and plugged in the\npower and his cell phone. After\nfinishing all that, I popped down in a\nchair, crossed my legs, and waited.\nAfter about the time it takes to drink a\ncup of tea, several Imperial guards\nbrought Wong Gang to the prison. An\nX-shaped rack was fixed to the wall of\nthe cell, and Wong Gang was tied to this\nrack. Seeing Wong Gangs current state,\nWei Wu couldn't help but sigh inwardly,\nrealizing how ruthless the methods of\nthe embroidered uniform guards prison\nwere. The once arrogant and doineering\nburly man is now disheveled and covered\nin wounds. His body was covered in blood\nand scabs. He no longer resembled a\ndignified protector. I reckon this guy\nhasn't slept for several days, and he\nseems a bit out of it now. Even so, we\nwu could hear him seemingly muttering\nsome scriptures. Splash. Before Wei Wu\ncould even ask, the Imperial Guard who\nbrought the man poured cold water on\nWong Gang. Whether it was the\nstimulation of the temperature or the\npain from the water on his wound, Wong\nGangs consciousness immediately cleared\nup considerably. As soon as he looked\nup, he saw Wei Wu sitting in front of\nhim with his legs crossed, a half smile\non his face. Upon seeing Weii Wu&lt;unk&gt;s\nface, Wong Gang felt a surge of anger\nand immediately spoke up. \"What? You\nthink you're useful just because you\nwere brought here after getting nothing\nout of those good for nothings? You\nfilthy bastard who blasphemed against my\nmother? You ambush me with that weird\nweapon. If you have the guts, let me go.\nLet's see if I can tear you bastard to\nshreds. Wong Gang glared at Wei Wu with\nresentment, but Weii Wu immediately\nlaughed as soon as he finished speaking.\nA sneak attack, please. Have you ever\nseen anyone shout to warn the enemy\nbefore launching a sneak attack? And I\nmust emphasize one point. That's not\nsome weird weapon. It's a magical\nartifact. A magical artifact that\ncontrols lightning for my own use. Don't\nyou understand? After saying that, Wayi\nWu flipped his wrist in front of Wong\nGang and took out the stun gun with his\nother hand. Then he slammed his hand on\nthe table with a loud thud. Upon seeing\nthis thing again, Wong Gang\ninstinctively shuddered. Chapter 1 16. 8\nGod descends and a Brahma sound\nresounds. Dare you say, \"I'm not\nimmortal.\" Wayi Wu happened to see this\nscene and made a teasing remark. What\nscared? Snort. Upon hearing Weii\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s voice, Wong Gang snorted coldly\nand said, \"Afraid? With the protection\nof the eternal mother divine art? Why\nwould I be afraid?\" Upon hearing this,\nWayi Wu burst in a laughter on the spot.\n\"Haha, divine protection, but your\nprotective divine power was broken by my\nmagic weapon. Otherwise, you wouldn't be\nhere.\" Upon hearing this, Wong Gang\nimmediately lost his composure and\nloudly retorted, \"You, that's some kind\nof heretical and evil practice. If even\nevil tricks can break through your\nmother's divine protection, then your\nmother isn't that powerful.\" Nonsense.\nIt's my own talent that's limited. My\nmother goddess is as mighty as the sea.\nHer magical power boundless. How dare\nyou, a wicked villain, desecrate her?\nSeeing Wong Gangs excited expression,\nWeii Wu couldn't help but shake his\nhead. He sighed inwardly, thinking that\nfanatics were truly beyond redemption\nand could only be described as\nterrifying. After thinking it over, Wei\nWu decided to first give Wong Gang a\npreconceived notion about him. This\nconvinced him that he truly understood\nmagic and was a disciple of some great\nimmortal. Only by strengthening this\nlabel will it be easier for people to\nbelieve in miracles later on. Seeing\nWong Gang&lt;unk&gt;s excited expression, Weii\nWu said nothing, but simply waved his\nhand sharply. The next second, a bag of\npotato chips inexplicably appeared on\nthe previously empty table. Then Wayi Wu\npicked up a potato chip and tore it\nopen, and the fragrant aroma of fried\nseasonings instantly filled the air.\nAfter stuffing a piece in his mouth,\nWayi Wu finally looked at Wong Gang\nopposite him. Why are you so agitated?\n[snorts] If you don't want to talk about\nyour mother, then talk about your\nmother's disciple, Master Bailey. While\nWeii Wu was speaking, Wong Gang was\nstaring blankly at the potato chips in\nhis hand. It wasn't that he wanted to\neat it, but rather that he was\nastonished by that ability to manipulate\nobjects out of thin air. This is\nsomething that only true immortal magic\nand tauist arts can achieve. However,\nupon hearing we wu&lt;unk&gt;s voice and\nregaining his senses, Wong Gang still\nstubbornly insisted. Trying to trick me\ninto telling you something. Huh? I have\nnothing to say to you. Sure enough, just\neating potato chips is too dry. You need\nto have some carbonated drinks with him.\nWe Woo ignored Wong Gang&lt;unk&gt;s words,\nsimply said something to himself, and\nthen snapped his fingers. A bottle of\nsparkling, refreshing Sprite reappeared\non the table. Wayi Wu picked it up and\ntook a big gulp before turning to look\nat Wong Gang. I'm not trying to trick\nyou. I just want to know if this white\nlotus immortal is actually a member of\nour immortal sect. If they're\nlike-minded, I may pay them a visit. But\nif they are charlatans who deceive the\nworld, I will go to their door and make\nsure their souls are scattered. Thanks\nto those two moves of voiding objects.\nWong Gang should have been intimidated.\nWhen he spoke again, his tone was no\nlonger as impolite as before. The white\nlotus immortal is a disciple of the\neternal mother who descended to the\nmortal realm to save the common people.\nHe is naturally a member of the immortal\nsect. On the contrary, I have never\nheard of the title of the deity Mikamiha\nMorasake. What makes you think you are a\nmember of the immortal sect? Wong Gang\nwanted to reveal the honorific title,\nbut unfortunately he had never heard of\nit before and the title was too\ncomplicated. He could only speak halfway\nbefore changing his mind. But just as he\nfinished speaking, a loud bang was\nheard. Bang. Weiiw suddenly stood up,\nslammed his hand on the table, and\nglared at him angrily. Remember, it is\nMikami, Shyen, Hashinto, Mizuno, Asika,\nand Okita sensei. Make sure you remember\ntheir title. If you call your teacher by\nthe wrong title again, don't blame me\nfor being ruthless. Despite Weii\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s harsh words and furious\nexpression, he was actually inwardly\nshuddering. I remember Cheyenne was\nfollowed by Amimey. Wouldn't this guy\nnotice if I replaced her with Hashimoto?\nNever mind. I can't even remember that\nmany myself, let alone him. There won't\nbe any problems. She silently reassured\nherself, trying to prevent Wong Gang\nfrom getting caught up in this issue.\nWeiwood didn't give him a chance to\nspeak and continued to stare at him\ncoldly, saying, \"Although teachers never\nwalk among people, they reside deep in\npeople's hearts. How dare you, audacious\naunt, presume to comment on them. If you\nwanted to prove myself, I can conjure\nobjects from thin air and control\nlightning. These abilities will be my\nproof.\" You say that the White Lotus\nimmortal is a member of my immortal\nsect. Then tell me, what kind of Tauist\nmagic does he use? and what kind of\nimmortal techniques does he know? At\nthis point, Weii Wu&lt;unk&gt;s eyes narrowed\nand he raised his hand to suddenly form\na hand seal that he wasn't even sure if\nit was a Daoist incantation. Then I\nheard him say in a low serious voice,\n\"I'd like to see if his methods can\nwithstand my vajra yaksha.\" As soon as\nhe finished speaking, we wu gently\npressed the remote control hidden in his\nleft hand. Upon receiving the signal,\nthe projector hidden behind Wei Woos\nseat immediately began to operate. This\nprojector isn't cheap. Automatic image\ncorrection is just the basics. The key\nis that it has a naked eye 3D effect.\nSuddenly, a blinding light appeared in\nthe dimly lit cell, and Wong Gang\ninstinctively squinted. At this moment,\nWayi Wu quietly picked up his phone and\nopened the music player app. A series of\nmajestic and solemn chants of Buddhist\nhymns suddenly appeared and echoed in a\nprison cell. Surrounded by the chanting\nof Buddhist scriptures, Wong Gang felt\nas if he were in the great hall of\n10,000 Buddhists. He was surrounded by\nmonks, arits, bodhisatwas, and the\nBuddha who sat at the highest point of\nthe hall. When he came to his senses\nfrom the chanting, he saw a scene that\nmade him tremble all over. On the white\nwall behind Wei Wu, a blue giant with a\ngreen face and fangs appeared. The giant\nstared intently at Wong Gang with a pair\nof menacing eyes as if he wanted to\ncrush him. Vajraiksha. This person has\nbeen disrespectful to the teacher. What\nshould be done? As he spoke, Wei Wu\npressed the remote control again and the\nblue giant with a green face and fangs\nbehind him began to move. At the same\ntime, the walkie-talkie that we woo had\nplaced next to the projector also\nstarted making noise. You insignificant\naunt, how dare you be so disrespectful\nto your majesty. I will crush you into\ndust so that you may never be\nreincarnated. Seeing the Vajra Sha about\nto attack, Wong Gangs eyes almost popped\nout of their sockets. He was scared.\nTruly scared. Weii Wu&lt;unk&gt;s ability to\nmanipulate object from thin air had only\nshocked him. But his current act of\nsurrendering to the gods filled him with\ndread. This is the difference between a\nfanatic's view of ordinary people and\ntheir view of gods. Fear arises from\nunwavering faith. Just when Wong Gang\nthought he was about to turn into dust\nand his soul would never be\nreincarnated. Weii Wu, who was standing\nopposite, suddenly spoke up. All right,\nI still have some questions for this\nperson. You may leave now. As he spoke,\nWayiu suddenly waved his hand and a rosy\nlight disappeared. The chanting vanished\nand the Vajra Yaksha also disappeared\nwithout a trace. At this moment, Wei Wu\nlooked at Wong Gang again and said with\na contemptuous gaze, \"Well, can my\nmethods prove my identity as a member of\nthe immortal sect.\" Upon hearing Wei\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s voice, Wong Gang stiffly turned\naround, his voice becoming much. May I\nask, what is your title, Da Lord? Seeing\nWong Gang&lt;unk&gt;s current state, Wayi Wu\ncouldn't help but chuckle to himself.\nThe feeling of using high technology to\nfool the ancients is so damn\ninteresting. Of course, Wayi Wu may have\nhad these thoughts in his mind, but his\nface remained serious. I am Mikami Hata\nShine Hashimoto Mizuno Asai, Okita\nSensei's younger brother, the Sashin\nKun. Chapter 117, playing tricks and\ndeception. actually yielded something\ngood. Wayi Wu himself did not know why\nhe had chosen such a Tauist name.\nAnyway, I just blurted out this nickname\nwhile we were talking. However, to be\nfair, the Tauist name suits those\nteachers quite well. Now that I have\nproven my identity, it is your turn to\ntell me what abilities the White Lotus\nTalist possesses. Or is he merely a\nfraud using the name of our immortal\nsect to swindle and tarnish our sex\nreputation? Upon hearing we woo&lt;unk&gt;s\nthreatening words, Wong Gang immediately\nbecame agitated. No, no, the White Lotus\nimmortal is not a fraud. The immortal\nreceived seven volumes of divine skills\nfrom the mother of no birth. The first\nvolume forcing the sun and moon to move\nthe constellations can once used reverse\nthe movement of the sun and moon and\nreposition the stars. The second volume,\nOverturning Seas and Moving Mountains,\ndriving forests and whipping stones can\nwhip poisonous dragons to overturn seas\nand send giant spirits to move\nmountains. The third volume, slaying\nimmortals and Buddhas, subduing tigers\nand dragons, states that even the most\nmonstrous dragons and tigers can be\nsubdued with a single shout. As for the\nancient Buddhas, they will surely be.\nHearing what Wong Gang said, Wayi\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s worldview was truly refreshed.\nSo before Wong Gang could finish\nspeaking, Wayi Wu reached out and\ninterrupted him. All right. All right.\nAll right. Even a great Luo golden\nimmortal wouldn't dare claim to be able\nto reverse the sun and moon or change\nthe positions of the stars. What merit\nor ability does this white lotus dowist\npossess? If you really have that\nability, you could wipe out the capital\nwith a single palm strike from the sky.\nWhy would you need to hide like a rat?\nWong Gang, you've been deceived by a\ncunning scoundrel without even realizing\nit. I don't know whether to call you\nnaive or stupid. To be honest, Wayi Wu\nreally didn't expect Wong Gang to be so\nstupid. How can something change the\nstars and move mountains? Is this a real\nperson or an immortal? Even with my\nadvanced technology, I wouldn't dare to\nboast like this. That damn White Lotus\nreal person is really daring to act like\nthis. The key is that he made it up. And\nsome people actually believed it. If I\nget my hands on a sci-fi apocalypse\nmovie and project it, could I start\ncult? They claimed to have created the\nworld and established a small world, but\nthis world is still evolving. Seeing\nWong Gangs blank expression, Weii Wu\nspoke up again, adding fuel to the fire.\nOnly true immortals from the upper realm\ncan unleash the power to overturn\nmountains and seas. The bodies of\nmortals simply cannot withstand the\npower of immortal energy. But this world\ncannot tolerate the descent of gods and\nimmortals. Even I, the Dao Lord, can\nonly summon a wisp of true spirit from\nthe upper realm to descend to the mortal\nworld. Otherwise, given your disrespect\ntowards the teacher, even if the\nVajgerayaksha were to descend to earth\nin his true form, I wouldn't be able to\nstop him once he gets angry. That white\nlotus master is clearly a charlatan.\nOnly someone as naive as you could be so\neasily deceived and manipulated by him.\nWayi Wu&lt;unk&gt;s words were like a steel\nknife slashing at Wong Gangs heart of\nfaith. At this moment, his unwavering\nfaith was not just wavering, but on the\nverge of collapse. At this moment, only\nthe last bit of something remained in\nhis heart, barely sustaining his faith.\nNo, no, that's impossible. I I have\ndivine protection. I'm invulnerable to\nswords and spears. This was a gift from\nmy mother. Upon hearing this, Wayi Wu\ndeliberately put on a pitying expression\nand slowly shook his head as he looked\nat him. Have you practiced martial arts\nwithin the White Lotus sect? Of course.\nI practice martial arts day and night in\norder to become a protector and\nsafeguard the holy sect. Isn't that it?\nYou practice day and night and it's all\nabout external martial arts. Is it\nstrange that you're invulnerable to\nswords and spears? At this point, Wayi\nWu picked up the stun gun and waved it\nin front of him. If you truly possess\ndivine protection, how could I have\nbroken it by using a magical artifact to\nactivate lightning magic? But everyone\nelse practices the same martial arts.\nEveryone learns the same techniques. So\nwhy am I the only one who is\ninvulnerable to swords and spears? To be\nhonest, Wong Gangs question really\nstumped Wei Wu. If everyone practices\nthe same martial art, but only Wong Gang\nis invulnerable to swords and spears,\nthat certainly doesn't make sense. Wayi\nWu pondered for a while and decided to\nfind a breakthrough by dealing with Wong\nGang. I only know magic arts and not\nmartial arts, but I can help you figure\nout. How about this? I'll ask and you\nanswer. When you were learning martial\narts at the White Lotus sect, did you\nhave anything that set you apart from\nothers? Something that only you had and\nno one else did? Upon hearing this, Wong\nGang frowned and fell into deep thought,\nthen seemed to have lost all his energy.\nAfter a long, distraught silence, he\nslowly began to speak. Seeing my\ndiligence and hard work, the White Lotus\nimmortal taught me three divine\nformulas. Using these medicines in\nconjunction with my cultivation practice\nwill make my efforts twice as effective.\nUpon hearing this, Weii Wu&lt;unk&gt;s eyes\nimmediately lit up. If Wong gangs\ninvulnerability to swords and spears is\ndue to this formula, then this thing is\nextremely valuable. If we could extract\nthis formula and then extract his method\nof practicing external martial arts, we\ncould use it on our own bodyguards. Good\nheavens. The guards who are supposed to\nbe invulnerable to swords and bullets\nare now armed with automatic rifles.\nThey're practically invincible. The mere\nthought of that scene immediately\nstirred way Woo's excitement. However,\nhe maintained a mysterious demeanor on\nthe surface, patiently persuading Wong\nGang as follows. Him: Well, I'm not\nskilled in martial arts, but I do have\nsome knowledge of alchemy. You might as\nwell tell me and I'll help you\nunderstand. Although Wong Gang was\nunable to get any information out of the\nembroidered uniform guard after being\ntortured by them, he was also mentally\nexhausted. In addition, Weii Wu had just\ndisplayed many magical techniques, and\nhis faith was beginning to crumble. At\nthis point, he was already somewhat\nunsettled, but at the same time, he\nfirmly believed that Weii Wu was indeed\na member of the immortal sect.\nTherefore, he did not question what Wei\nWu said and quickly replied. As for Wei\nWu, he had already turned on the\nrecording function on his phone when\nWong Gang was about to speak. The first\nmiraculous remedy is to heat natural\ncopper until it is red hot and soak it\nin vinegar seven times. Then pound\nangelica and leeches into a paste and\nrinse the unnamed herb with clean soil.\nWipe the shell of the memorial kachen\nchinencis seed with sesame oil. Roast it\nand take out the meat. Add equal parts\nof musk, myrrh, earthworm after removing\nthe soil and drying and sapanwood. Grind\nall the medicinal herbs into powder. Mix\nwith honey to form pills. Each pill\nweighing three chin, approximately 9 g.\nTake with water and wait half an hour.\nAfter swallowing it, use a lanthis with\nstick to pat your whole body. After 100\ndays, you will achieve twice the results\nwith half the effort and become a master\nof martial arts. Copper leech mamortica\nkachin chinensis. Upon hearing these\nthings, we wu couldn't help but suspect\nthat Wong Gang was trying to mislead\nhim. But looking at this guy's\ndistraught expression, it didn't seem\nlike he was playing mind games with me.\nHowever, before Wei Wu could think\nfurther, Wong Gang spoke up again. The\nsecond divine formula. 6chen of earth\ndragon bone, fireforged and vinegar\nquenched. 6chen of real horse bone,\nfireforged and quenched in horse oil.\nAnd six chen of ox bone, fireforged and\nquenched in lard. Six chen of dog bone.\nSix chen of turtle bone. One pair of\nfrogs. One shien of Shenzhene, a type of\nmedicinal herb. One shen of myrrh and\ntwo chien of aaranths bite and tata.\nGrind them into pills and take them with\nwarm wine. The third divine prescription\nis three catties of white poria cocoos.\nDried Romania root roasted over fire,\ndried asparagus root with the core\nremoved, and sesame seeds stir fried\nover fire. Each of the three herbs\nweighs one catt. Mix and grind of four\nherbs into powder. Then mix with honey\nto form pills. Take 10 pills three times\na day. You will see results after a full\nmonth and your strength will greatly\nincrease. You will achieve great success\nin 100 days. After Wong Gang finished\nexplaining the three prescriptions, we\nwu turned off the recording function on\nhis phone. Weii Wu plans to consult with\nseveral Imperial physicians about this\nprescription to see if there are any\nproblems. If there are no problems, then\nthis is a huge win. Chapter 118. Daist\nLord Wong Gang have atone for your sins.\nThe reason I say it's a huge profit is\nbecause this thing is precious. If\nnothing unexpected happens, the three\nformulas that Wong Gang mentioned are\nconsidered secret even within the White\nLotus sect. What kind of organization is\nthe White Lotus sect? It's a cult that\nspecifically targets and bewitches\nordinary people. To successfully sway\nthe people, one must possess something\ntruly remarkable. Among them may be\nprescriptions that have been lost since\na certain era. This was highly likely in\nWei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s view. Before he\ntransmigrated, Weii Wu had a classmate\nwhose family was a family of traditional\nChinese medicine practitioners. That\nclassmate once said something to him. In\nfact, the so-called traditional Chinese\nmedicine actually refers to doctors from\ntheQin and Han dynasties. Because most\nof the prescriptions appeared during\ntheQin dynasty and Han dynasty medical\nscholars summarized and established\ntheories. Many prescriptions in later\ngenerations were variations derived from\nprescriptions from theQin and Han\ndynasties. Medical theories remained\ncorrect until the Han and Tang dynasties\nbut became outdated after the Song\nDynasty. Lee Don Yuan, a physician\nduring the Song Dynasty, and later Zhu\nDoni, combined the Inyong theory of the\nYellow Emperor's inner classic to create\nthe Doni heart method. In medical\npractice, there's a lot of exaggerated\ntalk about inyong and the five elements,\nwhich are related, but not very\nrelevant. So much so that it was later\ncategorized as metaphysics and\nwitchcraft by the West and even by many\nnative Chinese people. The White Lotus\nsect was a religious sect that emerged\nduring the Southern Song Dynasty. So,\nit's not surprising that they possess\nsome lost medicinal formulas. Let's go\nback to Wong Gang's side. A fanatic like\nhim would be an absolute core figure in\nany religious sect. There is no doubt\nthat such believers would betray their\nfaith and there is no problem with them\ngiving good things to their own people.\nThat's why we wu firmly believe that if\nwhat Wong Gang said was true, then he\nwould really make a fortune. Dowist\nMaster, is there anything wrong with my\nprescription? Seeing that, Wayi Wu\nremained silent. Wong Gang asked with\nhis last glimmer of hope. Upon hearing\nhis voice, Wayi Wu finally snapped out\nof his days and replied, \"No problem.\nThis prescription is indeed very\neffective. But but how?\" Wayi Wu&lt;unk&gt;s\npause made Wong Gang anxious. He now\ngenuinely wanted to know the truth.\nSeeing this, Wei Wu sighed softly. Tell\nme your training method again and I'll\nverify if they match my guess. Wong Gang\nwithout any suspicion immediately\nexplained the training method. Weii Wu\nalso recorded it with his phone, but\nWong Gangs training method was nothing\nspecial. Even though Wei Wu had never\npracticed martial arts, he could tell\nfrom the conversation that it was just\nsome normal methods for improving one's\nphysical fitness. So, barring any\nunforeseen circumstances, the miraculous\ninvulnerability to swords and spears\nmust be due to those three\nprescriptions. After Wong Gang finished\nspeaking, Wayi Wu looked at him with\nfigned pity and let out a long sigh.\nWong Gang, you've been fooled. These six\nsimple words shattered the last vestage\nof faith in Wong Gang&lt;unk&gt;s heart. His\nbody and expression were completely\nfrozen, as if struck by lightning, as if\nthe whole world had collapsed. Seeing\nthis, we wu continued speaking. Your\nnot some divine power bestowed\nupon you by the eternal mother is\nsomething you have painstakingly\ncultivated yourself. Your daily arduous\ntraining and self-ultivation have honed\nyour willpower, and the miraculous\neffects of those three prescriptions\nhave given you the ability to protect\nyour body with divine power. However,\nthis prescription has long been lost,\nwhich is why Master Baleon was able to\nuse it to bewitch others, and you are\none of the victims.\" As we woo spoke,\nhis eyes surged with murderous intent,\nconveying a sense of boundless rage. I\nthought I had met a fellow cultivator\nfrom the immortal sect, but I never\nexpected him to be a charlatan who has\ntarnished the reputation of the immortal\nsect. He must be killed to establish our\nauthority. As soon as he finished\nspeaking, Wei Wu made another hand\ngesture, and his voice filled with rage\nrang out in the prison cell. By my\ndecree, summon the divine soul of Kong\nJin Long to descend to the mortal realm,\nto respond with a dragon's roar and\naccompany me, to help me slay the wicked\nand deceitful and restore order to the\nworld. As he spoke, Wayi Wu wave his\nhand again, and a dazzling ray of light\nappear behind him. As the rosy light\nflickered, the white wall behind them\nchanged once again. But this time,\ninstead of a blue-faced fanged Vadri\nYiksha, a pure white dragon with a\nsingle horn appeared. A long snow white\ndragon snaked and danced while a furious\ndragon roar came from behind Wei Wu. At\nthat moment, Weii Wu changed his hand\nseals, and the white dragon instantly\nfroze on the wall, its roar disappearing\nwithout a trace. Wong Gang stared\nblankly at the white dragon. This time\nhe was no longer afraid, but only filled\nwith worship and piety. Looking at Wong\nGangs current appearance, Wayi Wu&lt;unk&gt;s\nlips curled into a barely perceptible\nsmile. But the key to this play hasn't\nbeen revealed yet, so he has to keep\npretending. Wong Gang, I will show you\nleniency this time because you are not a\nbad person of heart, but a pitiful\nperson who's been deceived. You are\nallowed to atone for your sins by\ntruthfully revealing the location of the\nWhite Lotus sect headquarters and the\nhiding place of the White Lotus Master.\nOtherwise, with the divine might of my\nKong Jin Long, a single roar from my\ndragon will shatter your soul and\ncondemn you to eternal damnation. Having\ngone this far in showing off, Wayi Wu\nfelt he had done enough. They plan to\nmake Kong Jin Long move slightly more,\nforcing Wong Gang to immediately confess\neverything. However, to his surprise,\nWong Gangs next reaction was completely\nunexpected. Before he could even begin\nto act, Wong Gang, who is tied to the\nrack, suddenly burst into tears. I am a\nsinner. A sinner. I was bewitched by\nthat wicked and deceitful white lotus\ndemon and ended up aiding and abetting\nevil, bringing calamity to the world.\nWong Gang dares not ask for the Dao\nLord's forgiveness. He only wishes that\nthe Dao Lord can rid the world of this\nevil man. Wong Gang is willing to atone\nfor his sins with his death. Seeing Wong\nGangs reaction, Wayi Wu didn't know what\nto feel. Should we be angry at their\nignorance or laugh at their lack of\nknowledge? Admittedly, he directed this\nshow and the combination of various\ntechnologies was quite impressive. But\nWong Gang, that guy should have just\nrevealed the information about the White\nLotus sect instead of offering to atone\nfor his sins with his death. Shouldn't a\nperson live for themselves? His life was\ndedicated to a vague and ethereal god,\nas if he had lost himself. The White\nLotus sect is a damned brainwashing cult\nthat has truly harmed countless people.\nJust as Weii Wu was sighing inwardly,\nWong Gang spoke up again, revealing news\nabout the White Lotus sect. Reporting to\nthe Daist Lord, the White Lotus cult has\nno headquarters and has been constantly\nchanging sides. Currently, it is hiding\nin Renong in the Chileu region. The\nWhite Lotus Demon's whereabouts are\nunpredictable. He never stays in one\nplace for long. Any instructions he\nreceives are relayed by the four great\nDharma kings. Ren Shang is now under the\nrule of the Dharma King Chingya.\nOstensibly, it is a Buddhist temple\ncalled Huian Temple, but has a secret\npassage leading underground. Wong Gang\nseemed determined to atone for his sins,\nand he revealed everything he knew about\nthe White Lotus sect. Everything he said\nwas remembered by Jean Hao outside the\ndoor. Just as Wei Wu was about to speak\nafter Wong Gang finished speaking, he\nsaw Wong Gang slowly lower his head. At\nthis moment, there was no emotion in his\neyes. Only calmness as calm as still\nwater. Dao Jun Wong Gang has revealed\neverything he knew. Now is the time for\nme to atone for my sins. Wong Gong No.\nWayi Wu wanted to speak up to stop him,\nbut it was too late. A dazzling flower\nof blood bloomed before his eyes. Wong\nGang, you have atoned. Chapter 119. The\nprison matter is settled. Rush to the\nImperial Hospital for medicine. It is\nsaid that greed, anger, and ignorance\nare the three poisons of human beings.\nWaywood didn't really understand these\nwords before, but now he feels them\ndeeply. Wong Gang, who is already dead,\nis clearly a typical example of someone\nwho is mentally unstable. To be honest,\nWayi Wu really couldn't understand what\nforce had driven Wong Gang to this\npoint. Even though his hands and feet\nwere completely bound, he still managed\nto think of banging the back of his head\nagainst the wall. When Wong Gang lowered\nhis head earlier, Wayi Wu thought it was\njust a natural reaction to his low\nspirits. But when he said those words,\nWayi Wu realized what he was trying to\ndo. But it was too late. It's\nunimaginable how much force Wong Gang\nmust have used to completely fracture\nthe back of his skull. So much so that\nthe blood stains sprayed out and a\nbright red spider lily slowly bloomed on\nthe white wall. Bang. As Weii Wu stared\nintently, Jean Hao pushed open the cell\ndoor and slowly walked to the side. My\nlord, the prison is not a good place.\nWhy don't you go back first and leave\nthis to me?\" After Jean Hao finished\nspeaking in a low voice, Wei Wu nodded\nand then turned and walked out of the\ncell. However, after leaving the prison\ncell, he left Jean Hao with a message.\nLet Wong Gang rest in peace. Although he\ndid evil, he was just a pitiful person\nwho had been brainwashed. Emerging from\na Ginui prison, the afternoon sun shone\non my face, seemingly dispelling the\ngloom in my heart. Chowo Chow was not a\nsentimental person. His favorite state\nwas to live a carefree life without a\ncare in the world. Wong Gangs death did\nindeed touch him somewhat, but the\nfeeling quickly faded. I was in a good\nmood today and decided to give myself a\nday off, a rare opportunity to rest\nproperly. As a result, he ended up\nspending all his time in a Ginui prison,\nwhich left Wayi Wu feeling somewhat\nhelpless. Fortunately, the harvest was\nstill good. They obtained three lost\nspecial medicine recipes from the royal\npalace. We had previously suspected that\nWong Gang might deliberately give him a\nfake prescription to deceive him.\nHowever, after seeing what he just did,\nthere's no need to doubt it anymore.\nHowever, we still need to have someone\nverify whether this prescription has any\nside effects. For example, making\nsomeone's eyes appear clear yet foolish\nmakes them easier to fool. If it really\nworks, then this formula is interesting.\nLike the blue pills, the side effects\nare more valuable than the main\nbenefits. While his mind was racing with\nall sorts of thoughts, Wayi Wu was also\ngetting impatient. So the Imperial\nguards who were originally going to take\nhim home changed direction halfway and\nheaded towards the Imperial Medical\nAcademy. On the way, Wayi Wu took out\nhis phone and paper and began to copy\ndown the contents of the recording. The\nImperial Medical Academy during the Hong\nWu era was not large with only about 10\npeople in total. Among them were one\nImperial Physician, one Imperial\nPhysician assistant, one clerk for\nImperial Physicians, and several\nmiscellaneous servants. When the\nImperial physician Sushu learned that it\nwas Marque Chonglu Wei Wu who had\narrived, he personally ran out of the\ngovernment office to greet him. This\nwasn't just him being polite. It was his\nheartfelt gratitude to Wei Woo. Last\ntime, when the crown prince had smallox,\nif it weren't for Wei Woos sudden\nintervention to turn the tide, their\nImperial hospital might be facing\nanother bloody conflict. Therefore, it\nwasn't just the Imperial physician who\nremembered Weii Woos favor. everyone in\nthe Imperial Medical Academy did for him\nas soon as he came out of the government\noffice and saw Wu. Physician Sue greeted\nhim with a big laugh. Ah, the arrival of\nthe marquee of Changangle at our\nImperial Hospital is truly an honor.\nCome, come, please come in and have a\nseat. It is well known that sudden and\nexcessive favors can make people feel\nuncomfortable. Weii would didn't feel\nuncomfortable, but he couldn't\nunderstand why the other party was being\nso enthusiastic. Before he could figure\nout, physician Sue had already led him\nto sit down in the main hall. He even\nspecifically instructed the servants to\nbring out his finest tea, making sure to\ntreat Weii Wu well. At this moment, Wayi\nWu finally came to his senses and\ncouldn't help but ask the Imperial\nphysician Sue a question. Dr. Sue, it\nseems we haven't met often. I'm a little\nsurprised. Why are you so enthusiastic\ntowards me? Haha. The marquee of\nChangangle has a bad memory. You haven't\nforgotten about smallpox, have you? Oh,\nwhere physician Sue's enthusiasm came\nfrom. He couldn't help but chuckle to\nhimself. Thinking to himself, Old Ju\nreally made a great assist. Just as Wei\nWu was secretly laughing to himself.\nPhysician Sue spoke up again. Although I\ndid not handle the smallox case, the\nentire Imperial Medical Academy is\nunited and will always remember your\nkindness. Actually, we've always wanted\nto invite you to explain how to cure\nsmallpox, but we didn't dare to bother\nyou by coming here. Upon hearing this,\nwe wu quickly shook his head. No, no.\nWhen it comes to medical skills, who in\nthe Ming dynasty can compare with\nphysician Sue? How could I dare to show\noff my limited skills in front of an\nexpert and make a fool of myself?\nActually, this wasn't way Woo\ndeliberately flattering him. He was just\ntelling the truth. The Imperial\nphysician Sushu is truly a remarkable\nperson. As the head of the Imperial\nMedical Academy, he remained in power\nthrough the reigns of five emperors,\nHong Wu, Jangwin, Yongla, Renzong, and\nSchwanzong. He retired at the age of 80\nand returned to his hometown, passing\naway peacefully at the age of 87.\nthat he, as an imperial physician, was\nable to save his life during the Hong Wu\nreign was already incredibly impressive.\nHis medical skills, while perhaps not\nthe best in the Ming dynasty, were\ndefinitely among the top tier. This is\nwhy we Wu treated him so politely. The\nman was truly capable. A capable person\ndeserves respect, especially since he is\njust an ordinary person. Even ordinary\npeople are bound to have minor ailments\nlike headaches and fevers, and then\nthey'll need to consult someone to take\ntheir pulse. After a warm greeting, the\nservant brought out the brewed tea.\nPhysician Sue first made a gesture of\noffering tea and then slowly began to\nspeak. Lord Chonglu, is there anything\nthe Imperial Hospital needs during your\nvisit? Please speak freely. Upon hearing\nphysician Seuss speak, Wayi Woo\nimmediately took out the prescription he\nhad copied and handed it over. It's like\nthis. I accidentally obtained a few\nprescriptions that have been lost for a\nhundred years, and I would like to ask\nphysician Sue to help me verify them.\nUpon hearing that it was a lost recipe,\nDr. Sue's eyes also showed curiosity. He\ntook the prescription from Wei Woo,\nglanced at it, and then his eyes\nimmediately became confused. It's not\nreally the fault of physician Sue. It's\njust that way Wu&lt;unk&gt;s calligraphy was\ntoo elegant and unrestrained. Don't even\nmention that others can't understand it.\nSometimes even he himself might not be\nable to understand it after leaving it\nfor 2 days. However, saying it directly\nwould be a bit hurtful. So, physician\nSue used a slightly more tactful\napproach. Well, my eyesight isn't very\ngood and I can't see the small print\nclearly. It would be better if Lord\nChong Lu read it to me. That would be\njust as good. All right. After saying\nthat, Wayi Wu took back the prescription\nand read out the ingredients,\npreparation method, and method of\nadministration step by step. Physician\nSue listened silently until Wei Wu\nfinished reading the first prescription,\nat which point he lowered his head,\nfrowned, and fell into deep thought.\nAfter a long while, physician Sue\nfinally raised his head, and looked at\nwei Wu. Uncle Chanlu, the medicinal\nmaterials used in this prescription are\nall effective in clearing the meridians,\nreducing swelling, and dissipating\nnodules, and relieving pain by\ndispersing blood stasis. However, its\npreparation method is quite different\nfrom ordinary prescriptions. It is not\nlike a medicine for treating injuries,\nbut rather like a supplementary medicine\nfor strengthening muscles and bones.\nWayi Wu didn't understand\npharmarmacology, but when he heard\nphysician Sue say the words\nstrengthening muscles and bones, he knew\nthere was no doubt about it. So, he\nimmediately asked another question. Yes,\nI like to know if this medicine has any\nother side effects. Chapter 12. Can you\nget stronger by taking drugs? I'll try\nit too. We would just mention the\nmedicinal materials, preparation method,\nand method of administration. The matter\nof using a Chinese toune tree to beat\nthe whole body for 100 days was not\nmentioned. Physician Sue was able to\nmake a general diagnosis based solely on\nthe effects of the medicinal herbs which\nshows that his medical skills were\nindeed superb. Just as we woo was\npraising it, physician Sue did not hide\nanything and spoke again. I haven't\nverified it and I wouldn't dare to\nspeculate, but judging from the\nprescription alone, there's nothing\nwrong with it. There's no poison in it.\nThe only strange thing is that the\nprescription contains natural copper,\nwhich is not usually added to similar\nprescriptions. If it's just for healing,\nI wouldn't use this formula, but if it's\nfor strengthening muscles and bones,\nthis formula should be harmless. After\nphysician Sue finished speaking, Wayi Wu\nalso recounted how he had been slapped\nall over his body with a stick made of\natlantis wood. Upon hearing this,\nphysician Sue finally understood then.\nThat's right. Tunaensis has nourishing\nproperties. If you pat your body with\nit, as long as you pay attention to the\npressure, it will definitely be\neffective. This recipe is indeed a lost\nrecipe. I didn't expect that the Earl of\nChong Lu would actually find it. He's\nreally lucky. At this point, physician\nSue looked at Wayi Wu, hesitated for a\nmoment, and then spoke. Lord Chonglu,\nthis lost prescription is extremely\nprecious. If possible, could you allow\nme to compile and record it? I promise I\nwon't leak it out. I just don't want\nthis good recipe to be lost so I can\nleave something good for future\ngenerations. After Physician Sue\nwaved his hand. It's all right.\nPhysician Sue can record it. This is the\nwisdom of our ancestors, not my personal\nproperty. As soon as he finished\nspeaking, Physician Sue stood up, bowed\nto Wayi Wu, and said, \"Then thank you\nvery much, Lord Chong Lo. I, Sushu,\nguarantee that this formula will not be\nleaked during my lifetime, but will only\nbe recorded in books. Upon seeing this,\nWayi Wu immediately stood up to return\nthe greeting. And only after sitting\ndown again did he ask the most crucial\nquestion. If one takes this medicine and\ntrains diligently, will one be able to\nwithstand being stabbed by a knife after\n100 days. Physician Sue was taken aback\nfor a moment, then smiled and shook his\nhead. Impossible. Lord Chonglu thought\nabout it carefully. If it really had\nsuch a miraculous effect, how could this\nprescription have been lost? This is\nmedicine, not a magic medicine. It can\ngreatly strengthen the muscles and bones\nof those who practice aseticism. Beating\nwith the tune would helps the medicine\nto be absorbed, making the skin thicker\nand more resistant to beating. Upon\nhearing these words, Wayi Wu couldn't\nhelp but frown. I obtained this recipe\nfrom a member of the White Lotus sect.\nThat person was indeed invulnerable to\nswords and spears. Even steel blades\ncould not harm him. At most, the outer\ngarment is slightly damaged. Since the\nprescription doesn't have this effect,\nhow did he manage to do it? Seeing way\nWoo&lt;unk&gt;s furrowed brows, physician Sue\nMy ancestor once received the Bianke\nDivine Mirror Classic written by the\nancient divine physician Bien K from a\nstrange person, but there was never such\na divine prescription. Lord Chonglu, the\nWhite Lotus sect, is full of cunning and\ndeceitful people who use tricks to\nbewitch the world. There may be\nsomething fishy going on here. Upon\nhearing physician Sue's words, Wayi Wu's\neyes immediately lit up. Indeed, the\ntricks and schemes of the martial arts\nworld are often unpredictable, just like\nthe incredible magic tricks of later\ngenerations. It would be difficult for\nordinary people to guess how they did\nit, and I'm probably blinded by their\nmethods. In fact, we woo himself\noriginally wanted to try it out and\nexperience the joy of being invulnerable\nto swords and spears and indestructible.\nBut if it's really just thick skinned as\nDr. Sue said, then there's no need for\nthis. Anyway, he doesn't fight, but this\nthing is quite suitable for Shan Llin\nand the others. Thinking of this, we woo\nspoke again. Dr. Sue, I would like to\ntrouble you to take a look at these two\nprescriptions for me. Are they also\nexaggerated? The second prescription is\n6chen of earth dragon bone, fireforged\nand vinegar quenched. 6chen of real\nhorse bone, fireforged and quenched in\nhorse oil. And six chen of ox bone,\nfireforged and quenched in lard. Six\nchen of dog bone. Six chen of turtle\nbone. One pair of frogs, one shien of\nshenine, a type of medicinal herb, one\nchen of myrr, and two chen of acaranths\nbite and tata. Grind them into pills and\ntake them with warm wine. Physician Sue\nlistened carefully again, then pondered\nfor a moment before laughing. This\nformula is not a lost recipe. It's just\na pain relief remedy used by itinerant\nperformers. Proper doctors wouldn't use\nit. After taking this medicine, you will\nfeel swelling all over your body. You\nwill not feel pain no matter how much\nyou are hit. In fact, you will feel more\ncomfortable the more you are hit, but\nyou will still get hurt. Therefore, it\nis also known as the painless remedy.\nAfterwards, you only need to soak\nlicorice in water, drink the medicine,\nand the effects will subside, and then\nthe pain will return. To be honest,\nafter hearing what physician Sue said,\nWayi Wu truly regretted not saving Wong\nGang. If he were there, with mutual\nverification, it might be easier to\ndistinguish the authenticity of the\nprescription. Fortunately, although this\nprescription is not a lost and precious\nmedicine, it is still effective, so it's\nnot a loss. Only two of the three\nprescriptions have been verified, the\nremaining one might also be a good\nthing. While filled with anticipation,\nWayi Wu directly revealed the third\nprescription. This time, physician Sue\ngave Wei Wu a satisfactory answer almost\nwithout hesitation. It is indeed a lost\nfolk remedy. The ingredients used in\nthis remedy are all for replenishing\ndeficiencies, prolonging life,\nstrengthening muscles and bones, and\nnourishing in fluids. In particular,\ngenerating body fluids is especially\nimportant. Body fluids can transform\ninto blood to nourish the five internal\norgans, nourish the meridians and\nmuscles of the whole body, and replenish\nkidney. Long-term use can greatly\nincrease a person's strength. This\nformula is actually recorded in the\ndivine mirror classic where is called\nthe mighty divine formula or the\nthousand gene formula. At this point,\nphysician Sue hesitated for a moment\nbefore whispering something. Actually,\nthis formula is indeed very effective.\nHis highness prince Chin once took it\nand it could be described as giving him\nimmense strength. Upon hearing what\nphysician Su said, Wayi Wu suddenly\nthought of something. Could it be that\nthe reason why King Zhu Schwang ofQin\nwas so cruel was because he possessed\ntoo much power as a vassal king? He had\nno way to use his strength after taking\nup his post and over time he became ill\nfor being cooped up. Seeing wei Wu\nremained silent. Physician Sue assumed\nthat we woo was considering whether or\nnot to take the medicine. If the Earl of\nChonglu is interested, the Divine Mirror\nClassic contains a modified formula\nwritten by the sage of traditional\nChinese medicine, BNK, called Heli San,\nwhich is even more effective. The\nthousand gene formula requires rigorous\ntraining to increase strength. But the\ncombined strength powder only needs to\nbe taken continuously to gradually\nincrease strength. Practitioners\nemphasize diligent practice and daily\ntraining, but we doctors emphasize\nconditioning and nourishment to\nstrengthen the body. Physician Sue's\nwords brought we woo quite a pleasant\nsurprise. He did consider trying these\nprescriptions himself, but gave up when\nhe learned that they required rigorous\npractice. If simply taking drugs can\nincrease strength, this kind of\nlaid-back approach is simply too good to\npass up. There's just one question. if\nthis prescription really has such an\neffect. Why did Ju Schwang still use the\nShenzhene prescription? Just as Wei Wu\nwas wondering, physician Sue seemed to\nhave guessed what he was thinking and\nexplained. This prescription uses some\nstrong medicines and some of the herbs\nare toxic. Even if they are harmless,\nthey're still easily avoided. Upon\nhearing this, Wayi Wu suddenly\nunderstood. Indeed, the Imperial\nphysicians could not prescribe medicine\nfor the royal family at will. There were\nmany restrictions. Therefore, the\nImperial physicians dared not use many\neffective wolf and tiger medicines\ncasually. However, we would didn't stand\non ceremony and immediately spoke up. In\nthat case, I would be most grateful if\nphysician Sue could pass on the\nprescription to me. Chapter 121 common\nsense from later generations was also\nvaluable knowledge in ancient times.\nAlthough the prescription contained\npoisonous herbs, Wayi Wu was not\nparticularly concerned. His classmate\nhad told him that many Chinese medicines\nare poisonous, such as raw akenite. In\nfact, many prescriptions used the\ntoxicity of this herb for toxic\nnourishment, so people don't mind.\nMoreover, as the imperial physician,\nSushu would not stoop to harming someone\nwho was a favorite of the emperor.\nSeeing wei Wu so calm, it was physician\nSu who became somewhat puzzled. Lord\nChonglu, this prescription contains\npoisonous herbs. Aren't you worried?\nWhat's there to worry about? It's not\nlike I haven't drunk poison food before.\nMy friend once gave me a prescription\nfor it. Oh, upon hearing we woo&lt;unk&gt;s\nwords, physician Sue became interested\nand then asked a follow-up question. I\nwonder which of your friends prescribed\nwhat remedy. I would like to hear it as\nwell. I don't know either. Anyway, he\nsaid that if I'm weak, I won't feel\nanything after taking this medicine.\nAfter saying that, Wayi Wu changed the\nsubject and continued. But if I'm not\nweak, I'll feel really uncomfortable\nafter drinking it. My whole body will\nfeel cold. My face will be pale. I'll be\nsweating profusely. Upon hearing this,\nphysician Sue stroked his beard and\nnodded slowly. That's right. The effect\nof this kind of prescription is like a\nbucket. When it's empty, it'll fill up.\nWhen it's full, it'll overflow. and the\noverflow will be reflected in the body's\ncondition. It seems that the Earl of\nChong Le's friend is also a highly\nskilled physician. I wonder how you felt\nafter drinking it. Weii Wu held his\nteacup, inwardly marveling at how\naccurate physician Sue's words had been.\nUpon hearing the question, I casually\nreplied. After I finished drinking it, I\nfelt completely lightaded and awful.\nYour excellency is in excellent health.\nPhysician Sue praised him softly, then\nfound paper and pen, wrote down the\nprescription, and handed it to Wei Wu.\nAt the same time, they also reminded him\nof the proper way to take the medication\nand what precautions to take. Weii Wu\ntook the prescription, hesitated for a\nask a question. Physician Sue Wayi Wu\nhas a question. Why are you taking such\ngood care of me?\nMy Phi the method of using cowpox to\ncontrol smallpox which can benefit the\npeople of the world is something that\nSushu admires. That's all. I've already\nspread this method from the Hyman\npharmacy and I believe that no more\ninnocent people will die from smallox in\nthe future. The Hyman pharmacy\noriginated in the northern Song Dynasty.\nIt was initially called the Shiouo and\nlater changed to the Eyao Huju. After\nZhu Yuan Jang established the Ming\ndynasty, he continued the Song Dynasty\nsystem and opened the Huyman pharmacy\nand not only solved the problems of\ndifficulty and high cost of medical\ntreatment for poor people, but also\nprovided medicine in addition to medical\ntreatment. It's important to know that\nin ancient times, medicine and medicine\nwere often separate processes. Doctors\nwould only see the patient and prescribe\nmedicine while the patient would go to\nthe pharmacy to get the medicine\nthemselves. As a result, the Hayman\npharmacy along with the Yang Jiuan and\nLuzuin was one of the three major\ncharitable initiatives of the Ming\ndynasty. Wayiu originally thought that\nphysician Sue was only because he had\nhelped the Imperial Hospital survive\nsmallox. Unexpectedly, what truly\nconcerned physician Sue was the method.\nHowever, this also proves that the\nImperial physician in front of us truly\nhas the heart to heal the sick and save\nlives. Since that's the case, Wayiu\nwouldn't mind helping him out again and\nincidentally promoting the medical\nprogress of the Ming dynasty. Dr. Sue,\nalthough I don't know how to cure\ndiseases, I do have some discoveries and\nideas about medicine. Please wait for\nme. After saying this, Wayi Wu got up\nand left without waiting for physician\nso to speak. When he returned, he had an\noptical instrument in his hand, commonly\nknown as a microscope. Placing the\nmicroscope on the table, Weii Wu turned\nto physician Sue and asked, \"Dr. Sue, do\nyou know anything about gooorms?\" \"I\nknow a little about it. The gooorm is\nwidely believed in the southern Shinjang\nregion.\" Physician Sue nodded and told\nthe truth, but then he added a sentence.\nI have never seen it with my own eyes,\nbut I do know that the people there use\ninsect medicine, which has a miraculous\neffect on treating diseases and saving\nlives. We had heard of insectbased\nmedicines, but he didn't know much about\nthem. Moreover, what he's talking about\nnow isn't insect medicine or gooorms,\nbut rather microorganisms like bacteria\nand viruses. So, after physician Sue\nchanged the subject. Dr. Sue, what I'm\nabout to say may overturn your\nunderstanding, but it is indeed true. A\nlarge proportion of the sick people in\nthis world are sick because something\neven smaller than a gooworm has entered\ntheir bodies. Even the wounded soldiers\non the battlefield whose wounds fester\nand ulcerate are caused by these tiny\nlives that are invisible to the naked\neye. At this point, we woo paused,\ngiving physicians sue time to process\nwhat he had said. After pausing for a\nmoment, he continued speaking. These\nlife forms are collectively called\nmicroorganisms. It is because of their\nexistence that food rots, wounds fester,\nand people get sick. Fortunately, most\nmicroorganisms are not heat resistant,\nso is best to boil or cook everything,\nwhether is drinking water or food.\nHearing this, physician Sue finally came\nto his senses. However, he didn't quite\nbelieve what we wu said and had many\ndoubts in his heart. Lord Chonglu,\nalthough I know that illness can be\ncaused by what we eat. What you are\nsaying is too shocking and I cannot\nunderstand it. If there are indeed goo\nmicroorganisms that are invisible to the\nnaked eye, how did you detect and know\nabout them? And how did you prove it?\nIt's very simple. As he spoke, Wayi Woo\npushed the microscope in front of\nphysician Sue. This will prove it.\nPhysician Su looked at the strange\nobject in front of him with suspicion,\nwondering what it was. Deep down, he\ntruly didn't believe what we woo had\nsaid. But we ws current expression is\ntoo confident. And there's also the\nmatter of the smallox incident. So even\nthough he had his doubts, he patiently\nlistened to Wayi Wu finished speaking.\nJust then, we wu took out a small\ntransparent piece and rubbed it on Dr.\nSue's palm. He then placed it under the\nmicroscope, adjusted it, and only then\ndid he say a few words to physician Sue.\nNow, let's see how many microorganisms\nlive in the palm of your hand.\nImmediately afterward, under Wei Woos\nguidance, physician Sue brought his eyes\nclose to the microscope's observation\nport. When those wriggling\nmicroorganisms were reflected in his\neyes through the microscope, Dr. Sue was\nterrified. I was genuinely terrified.\nThose strangely shaped moving little\ncreatures actually live in the palm of\nyour hand. After a long while, physician\nSue finally came to his senses from the\nshock and stiffly turned his neck to\nlook at Wayi. Woo! Uncle Chong, the\nmicroorganisms you mentioned truly\nexist, and they reside right in the palm\nof my hand. It's not just your palm, nor\nis it only your palm. It's present on\neveryone. It's everywhere. As he spoke,\nWayi Wu stretched out his hand and waved\nit in the air as if he were fiddling\nwith the microorganisms. But that's not\nthe point because understanding them\nrequires years of dedicated research and\nexploration. I'm saying all this so that\nDr. Sue can have a basic understanding\nand at the same time I can use you to\nspread a concept. Water must be boiled\nbefore drinking and a cloth used to wipe\nwounds must be boiled to kill\nmicroorganisms before it can be used. In\nthis way, we can prevent many people\nfrom getting sick from drinking water\nand dying from infected wounds. Chapter\n1:22. From this day forward, you'll be\nthe knives in my hand. Waywood didn't\nunderstand medicine. He only knew some\nbasic common sense. However, even these\nbasic common sense facts are definitely\nhelpful in this era. It's worth noting\nthat in the early days of the People's\nRepublic of China, the government\nspecifically promoted the idea that\nwater should be boiled before drinking.\nHaving verified Weii Wu&lt;unk&gt;s\ndescription of microorganisms,\nphysicians Sue felt as if he had opened\na door to a new world, he insisted on\nchatting with Wei Wu and wouldn't let\nhim leave, as if he wouldn't stop until\nhe had squeezed him dry. In the end,\neverything that we woo knew was revealed\nby physician Sue. It was even mentioned\nthat forceps can help women give birth\nsmoothly. Although these were all common\nsense facts, they became important\nknowledge that enlightened Physician\nSue. In the end, Wayi Wu was truly\nsqueezed dry of everything. They simply\ngave a microscope to physician Sue to\ndivert his attention. As soon as we woo\nleft the Imperial hospital, he rushed\ninto the carriage as if a demon were\nchasing him. Escorted by the Imperial\nguards, he finally returned to his warm\nhome. For the next few days, Wayi Wu\ncontinued to shuttle between the two\npoints with little time to rest. On this\nday, after finishing his lecture to the\ncraftsman, Wei Wu came to the shooting\nrange. At this moment, Shanlin and the\nother 12 were so engrossed in practicing\ntheir shooting skills that they didn't\neven notice wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s arrival. Weii\nWu didn't remind them. He simply stood a\nshort distance away to observe their\ncurrent mastery of firearms. The result,\nhowever, delighted him greatly. After\nthis period of practice, Shunlin and his\ngroup have become quite skilled at both\nholding and shooting guns. After a long\nwhile, when they were resting, Weii Wu\nfinally came out. Upon seeing him,\nShinlin immediately led the guards to\ngreet him. Young master, you've arrived.\nH I came to see how your training is\ngoing. Hearing this, Shinllin assumed Wu\nwas testing their spear training. So he\nimmediately replied, \"Young master,\neveryone has trained hard and now\neveryone can hit the target at 100\nmeters without missing.\" Upon hearing\nthis result, Wayi Wu nodded in\nsatisfaction. In fact, he didn't have\nhigh expectations for the guards. This\nwasn't about training sharpshooters, and\nhe didn't have the ability to do that\nanyway. As long as you don't miss the\ntarget within a 100 m range, that's\nenough. You should know that the targets\nat the shooting range nowadays are about\nthe size of a person. In other words,\neach of these 12 guards could accurately\nhit a person within a 100 meter radius.\nIn ancient times, this level of accuracy\nwas sufficient since the enemy didn't\nhave guns anyway. Therefore, after Shan\nLinn finished speaking, Wayiu\nthem. Very good. I am very satisfied\nwith your serious and hardworking\nattitude. From today onwards, you will\nno longer be my guards. Upon hearing\nWeii Wu&lt;unk&gt;s words, the guards all\nfroze in place. They thought that they\nhadn't worked hard enough or achieved\ngood enough results, which was why Wei\nWu had given up on them. Seeing their\nreaction, Wei Wu knew they had made a\nmistake, so he quickly spoke up.\nAlthough the courtyard is large, anyone\ncan be a guard, and there is no danger\nin the capital. As for you, I'd rather\nyou be the blade in my hand. Whoever\ndares to cause me trouble, you can cut\nthem down. Can you do that? At this\nmoment, the 12 guards emotions were like\nthose of someone riding a roller\ncoaster, rising and falling.\nFortunately, the process was a bit\nexciting, but the result was good. Upon\nhearing Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s words, the guards\ndid not hesitate at all and immediately\nknelt on one knee in front of Wayi Wu.\nWe are willing to be the young master's\nsharpest blade to slay enemies and kill\ntraitors. Anyone who dares to cause\ntrouble for the young master, we will\ncut them down. Very good. Get up all of\nyou. Looking at the 12 guards kneeling\non one knee with their heads bowed. Weii\nWu was extremely satisfied. From now on,\nyou'll be a team. I've named you Wu\nChang, meaning the impermanent ones soul\nlocking and spirit snatching. Shunlin\nand Jean Hai will remain the captain and\nvice captain respectively. From today\nonwards, I will be responsible for all\nyour weddings and funerals. 200 tales of\nsilver per person per year and 300 tales\nfor the captain and deputy captain.\nEveryone will receive a bonus for\ncompleting the tasks I assign. At this\npoint, Wayi Wu paused for a moment,\nglanced at them, and then continued,\n\"And I have only one requirement for\nyou. Loyalty. Absolute loyalty. Tell me,\ncan you do that?\" We swear to serve our\nyoung master to the death. We wu nodded\nslowly before continuing. There's a\nsaying that practice is the only\ncriterion for judging results. Now you\nare proficient in handling firearms.\nThen I can now confidently hand over the\nreigns to you. I want you to go to Sujo\nand wipe out the Lu clan. Upon hearing\nthis, Shunlin's expression hardened and\nall the guards around him also focused\ntheir attention on wei Wu. They were not\nordinary people. They were all former\nmembers of the embroidered uniform\nguard. So how could they not know about\nthe Lou family? This is the family of\nthe crown princess who just passed away\nnot long ago. And we wu actually want to\nwipe out this family. Seeing the\nexpressions on the faces of the\nimpermanence squad members, we wu smiled\nslightly. What scared? We're not afraid.\nWhoever the young master says to be\nkilled will kill. No sooner had we Wu\nfinished speaking than Shan Llin gave\nhis reply. At the same time, the rest of\nthe impermanent squad also came to their\nsenses, their eyes filled with coldness.\nnot hesitation. Upon hearing their\nreply, Weii Wu said with satisfaction,\n\"Very good.\" After saying that, he\nimmediately took out 3,000 strings of\ncash from his pocket and handed them to\nShinllin. Distribute the money to the\nbrothers and used the extra 400 tales to\nbuy them a nice set of clothes and then\ngo to the Chin Huai River for some\nentertainment. Let's relax tonight.\nWe'll head to Sujo first thing tomorrow\nmorning. I'll reimburse you for any\nexpenses you incur along the way when we\nget back. In addition, I have asked his\nhighness the crown prince to arrange for\nyou to have genuine identities so you\ndon't need to worry about travel permits\non the road. Shanlin and Jean Hai stay\nhere. The rest of you may disperse and\nrest. Upon receiving Weii Wu&lt;unk&gt;s\norder, the 10 members of the impermanent\nsquad immediately dispersed. After\neveryone had left, we wu looked at Shan\nLllin and Jean Hai. The Lou family\nwields considerable power in Sujo. We've\nbrought guns with us for this operation,\nand each of you will have enough\nammunition for two drum magazines. The\ndrum magazine is the same type that\ncomes with the M4 A1, and each drum\nmagazine can hold 100 rounds. The\nimpermanent squad consists of 12 people,\neach with two drum magazines, which\nmeans they have 2,400 bullets. Given the\npower of the firearms, these bullets\nshould be more than enough to deal with\na gentry family in Jangan. It wasn't\nthat way Wu didn't want to give more. It\nwas just that if he did, Shan Linn and\nthe others wouldn't be able to carry it\nall with them. Although bullets are\nsmall, a large number of them can still\nmake it difficult for a person to move\naround. After discussing the ammunition,\nWei Wu changed the subject and brought\nup another matter. Shinlin Jean Hai. In\naddition to wiping out the Louu clan,\nyou two have an extra mission this time.\nI want you to thoroughly investigate\nwhether the Lou family has any collusion\nwith the White Lotus sect or whether\nthey have any secret connections with\nthe Confucious family in Shufu.\nInvestigate this matter as thoroughly as\npossible. If you really can't find any\nclues, it would be best to capture the\nhead of the Lou family alive and bring\nhim back. Understand? Chapter 123.\ntransforming the impermanent squad into\na special forces squad. After Wei Wu\nfinished speaking, Shunlin and Jang Hai\nimmediately nodded to indicate that they\nunderstood. However, they were\ninevitably shocked as this matter\ninvolved the Confucious family of Tsufu,\nand it was probably not that simple.\nThis is a sacred place in the hearts of\nscholars all over the world, and our\nyoung master actually wants to\ninvestigate them. Despite their shock,\nneither Shinlin nor Jean Hai asked any\nfurther questions. They know very well\nwho saved their lives and who gave them\nthe good life they have now. Seeing the\ntwo nod, Wayi Wu gave them another piece\nof advice. Remember, your own safety is\nthe most important thing in an\nemergency. You can kill the head of the\nLou family, but you cannot get hurt. At\nthis point, Wayi Wu paused, then asked\nabout another matter. By the way, do\neither of you know anything about\nexternal martial arts? Upon hearing Wei\nWu's question, Shinlin immediately gave\nan answer. I've actually practiced\nexternal martial arts myself. Jean Hai's\nfamily has a method for practicing\nexternal martial arts, and that's where\nI learned it. It's just that their kung\nfu requires a medicinal formula, but\nunfortunately, that formula has been\nlost, so neither of us was able to\nmaster it. Hey, what a coincidence. I\nhave some. As soon as Shinllin finished\nspeaking, Weii Wu immediately burst into\nlaughter. That's perfect. I've got the\nprescription. It'll match Jean Hai's\ntraining method just right. As soon as\nwe Wu finished speaking, Jean Hai became\nexcited. Really, young master? This kind\nof prescription is a closely guarded\nsecret even among martial arts\npractitioners. Do you remember that\nwhite lotus sect protector from that\nday? This prescription was obtained from\nhim and the Imperial physician has\nverified it. Upon receiving Weii\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s personal confirmation, Jean Hai\nbecame even more excited and even\nShinllin, who was standing to the side,\nlooked on with anticipation. Then that's\nit. That guy is tough, strong, and\nincredibly powerful. He's clearly a\nmaster of external martial arts, but\nthere's something strange about him. At\nthis point, a hint of doubt appeared\nbetween Jean Hai's brows. If my family's\nrecipe hadn't been lost, Shanun Lllin\nand I could have been just as powerful\nonce we mastered it. But we still\nwouldn't be invulnerable to swords and\nspears. And that guy, he withtood the\nbrother's blows without even getting a\nscratch, which is very unusual. When\nphysician Sue mentioned it before, Wayi\nWu also found it strange. It wasn't\nuntil Jean Ho found in the next day that\nhe finally understood what had happened.\nActually, it's just that there's a layer\nof special silk thread woven inside Wong\nGangs clothes. This is something that\neven Wong Gang himself probably doesn't\nknow. He still thinks he's truly\ninvulnerable. Upon hearing Jean Hai's\nquestion, Wayi Wu immediately provided\nthe answer. It's not surprising. His\nclothes were tampered with. It's just\nsome trickery from the martial arts\nworld. Ordinary weapons can't hurt him.\nAfter we woo finished explaining, the\ntwo men finally looked enlightened. Then\nwe Wu continued, \"By the way, Jean Hai,\nare there any taboos in your family's\nexternal martial arts? Can you pass it\non to the other brothers? No problem,\nyoung master. As long as you agree, I\ncan teach them. That's good. Don't\nworry, young master. I won't let you\nsuffer any losses. I'll take out a\nthousand tales as compensation.\" Upon\nhearing this, Jean Hai immediately\nbecame anxious. Young Master, no. My\nfamily's martial arts are not some kind\nof unparalleled skill. All right, I said\nI'd give it to you. So, it's settled\nthen. Before Jean Hai could finish\nspeaking, Wayi Wu waved his hand to\ninterrupt him and then continued. I've\nalready made arrangements with the\nImperial Hospital. Physicians Sue will\nhelp prepare the medicines. There are\nthree kinds in total. There's one type\nthat works in conjunction with external\ntraining, another called the never hit\n100 strikes formula, and yet another\ncalled the thousand pound formula, which\ncan greatly increase strength. That's\nright. Wayiw still used the invincible\nremedy, but he treated it like an\nadrenaline-like drug. They should always\ncarry these with them in the impermanent\nsquad. They don't need to use them\nnormally, but they might save their\nlives in a critical moment. As for their\nstrength, it wasn't that way Wu was\nunwilling to give them the strength\nboosting powder, but rather that the\nmedicine was too slow to work. It\nrequires long-term use to gradually\nincrease strength. And in Wayi Wu's\nmind, the impermanent squad is\nequivalent to a special forces unit\nsince they were going to be training\nhard anyway. The thousand-lb formula was\nmore suitable for them as it would\ntemper their will and increase their\nstrength at the same time. After hearing\nWeii Wu&lt;unk&gt;s words, Shunlin and Jean\nHai's expressions could only be\ndescribed as eager. However, Weii\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s next sentence dashed their\nhopes. Preparing the medicine will take\ntime. It should be ready by the time you\nreturn from Jangan. Then you can start\npracticing. I want each and every one of\nyou to become capable of taking on a 100\nmen. When his majesty campaigns against\nthe Japanese pirates, you will all come\nwith me. Seeing Shan Lin and Jeang Hai\nnod emphatically, Weii Wu patted them on\nthe shoulder and said nothing more.\nAfter leaving the firing range, Weii Wu\nleft the Academy of Sciences in a\nhorsedrawn carriage. It wasn't that he\ndidn't want to travel by elephant\ncarriage, but the Academy of Sciences\nwas located outside the city. And the\nroad, there was a long and complicated\nroad. The elephant carriage could only\nbe used in the city or on the official\nroads. Even if the vehicle can withstand\nthe rigors on other sections of the\nroad, the horses won't be able to keep\nup. Back at his doorstep, Wayi Wu was\npondering when to find an opportunity to\ntry out the elephant chariot. Just as he\nwas deep in thought, a voice called out\nto him, \"Young master, something\nterrible has happened. Young master,\nsomething terrible has happened.\" As\nsoon as the sound came, a servant rushed\nup to him. Upon seeing the servant's\nappearance, Weii Wu immediately frowned\nbecause this young servant was someone\nhe had sent to help manager Hong at the\nBehi Chowing restaurant. If he suddenly\nruns back shouting that something is\nwrong, there's only one possibility.\nSomething happened at the Beehigh\nChowosing building. Don't rush. Tell me\nslowly what happened. Young master, the\nshop. Something's happened at the shop.\nOur shop has been vandalized. Something\nreally did happen at the shop. My shop\nhas only been open for a few days and\npeople are already causing trouble\ntrying to embarrass me, aren't they?\nExplain clearly what exactly happened.\nAfter we woo finished speaking, the\nservant took a few deep breaths, then\nimmediately said, \"Just now, a group of\npeople broke into our shop. They started\nsmashing things and completely destroyed\nour shop.\" Manager Huang was beaten\nuntil he vomited blood. and Miss Yian\nHong and Miss Chinlu were also taken to\na room on the second floor by those\npeople. Even when the Yammen officials\ncame, it was no use. The leader took out\na token and the Yammen guards were so\nfrightened that they ran away with their\nmen. Upon hearing what the servant said,\nWayi Wu&lt;unk&gt;s fiery temper flared up\nimmediately. Is it really that\noutrageous? Even in this tiny corner of\nBeijing, with all my powerful\nconnections, I've never been this\narrogant even once. Who is this guy?\nHe's even more arrogant than me, and his\nmethods are so wild. Thinking of this,\nWayi Wu couldn't help but ask a\nquestion. Do you know who the other\nparty is? I don't know. That person\ndidn't say, \"Did you identify yourself?\"\nThe servant nodded quickly. It's been\nreported. Manager Huang said that the Hi\nShang Lu restaurant belongs to you, your\nexcellency. But that person said,\n\"You're just a mural.\" A mural? In a\nplace like the capital, there are\ncountless dukes and marquises whose\nstatus is even higher than that of\nEarls. Since this person dared to smash\nhis shop and look down on his count\nstatus, it was obvious that he was no\nordinary person. Chapter 124. New\npackage, the gun of equality for all.\nWhile silently pondering this, Wei Wu\nlooked at the servant and asked him a\nquestion. Is that person still in the\nshop? Yes, he hasn't left. In fact, he\nasked me to come back and tell you that\nhe's waiting for you there. It seems\nsmashing the store was just a side\neffect. It was clearly aimed at me. Go\ntell the grooms to bring out my elephant\ncarriage. Upon hearing Weii Wu&lt;unk&gt;s\norder, the servant dared not hesitate\nand immediately ran out to inform the\ngroom. Based on what the servant had\njust said, Weii Wu could roughly guess\nwho had come to cause trouble. If\nnothing unexpected happens, it should be\nPrince Zu Schwang ofQin, as only he\nwould dare to be so arrogant and\ninscrupulous. However, there was one\nthing Weii Wu was unsure about. If the\nperson causing trouble at the Beehive\nChowing Tower was indeed Prince Chin,\nZhuang old Zhu couldn't possibly be\nunaware of this. So, how could he let\nhim come knocking on his door? As Wei Wu\nwas deep in thought, the coachman\nbrought the elephantdrawn carriage to a\nstop outside the mansion gate. The\nelephant chariot was 13 ft 9.5 in tall\nand 8 ft 2.5 in wide. The chariot seat\nwas 4t 1 in tall and the shaft was 22 ft\n9 in long. That translates to about 4 m\nhigh, about 2 1/2 m wide, and the seats\nare about 1 and 1/2 m high. The entire\nelephant carriage was 7 or 8 m long and\nblocked the entire entrance to the\nmansion. This was the first time Wei Wu\nhad ever seen such a magnificent\ncarriage. It was so ornate that it could\nbe described as a work of art. However,\nhe didn't have time to look closely and\ngrabbed the handrail to get on the bus.\nBut at that moment, a shout suddenly\ncame from not far away. Lord Chonglu,\nplease wait. We looked in the direction\nof the sound and saw Unic Wong striding\ntowards him. Upon seeing him appear,\nWayi Wu was now certain that the\ntroublemaker was none other than Guuang.\nThis Unic Wang didn't come earlier or\nlater, but he appeared at this crucial\nmoment. Moreover, he usually appeared\nwith an imperial edict from Zhu Yuan\nJang to Chow Chow or a message to be\nconveyed to him. As it turned out, Weii\nWu was right. The panting Yunuk Wong\nspoke as soon as he approached. Thank\ngoodness. Thank goodness I finally made\nit in time. Marque Chonglu, his majesty\nsent me to deliver a message to you.\nPlease speak, Unuang. Weii Wu gestured\nwith his hand, then heard Unic Wong\nclear his throat and say, \"His majesty\nsaid,\" Shiao Wu, if you are absolutely\ncertain that you can take down that\nrebellious son, then help us teach him a\ngood lesson. We won't have any\nobjections to what you do as long as you\ndon't die. But if you can't take him\ndown, don't worry about this. You don't\nneed to go to the Behi Chowong building\neither. We'll have someone handle it,\nand we'll fix the building for you.\nAfter hearing what Unic Wong had said,\nWayi Wu remained silent on the surface,\nbut he was muttering to himself in his\nheart. Old Ju is asking me, his\nson-in-law, to teach his son. Am I\nsupposed to become a thunder king like\nProfessor Yang and shatter the darkness\nwith lightning? Understood. Please ask\nUnic Wong to pass on a message. Rest\nassured, I will beat his son so badly he\nwon't recognize him. Beat them until\nthey're unrecognizable. Upon hearing wei\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s reply, \"Unong was at a loss for\nwords.\" \"Throughout history, no one has\never dared to speak to an emperor like\nthat. Yet there is one right in front of\nme.\" Wong Gong Gong chuckled inwardly\nbefore speaking. \"Then I will return to\nthe palace to report.\" After Unwong\nleft, Weii Wu waved his hand. \"Let's go\nto the Chin Huai River.\" At a command,\nthe groom pulled the res and the four\nhorses began to move forward with\nstrong, powerful strides. Sitting in the\nsedan chair, Weii Wu took advantage of a\nbreak to open today's blind box package.\nI selected the leftmost package from the\nthree packages and in a flash, a black\nbox appeared before my eyes. The box is\nonly slightly smaller than a cello box,\nand you can't tell what's inside. It\nwasn't until Wei Wu took out the box and\nopened it that a powerful looking\nsemi-automatic shotgun appeared before\nhim. In addition to the shotgun, the box\nalso contained 100 shotgun shells\nsystem. You understand me? The\ngun that grants equality to all beings.\nThat's true masculine romance. At the\nsame time, just as Wei Wu was overjoyed,\nthe interior of the Beehive Chaosing\nBuilding had already been smashed into\nruins. Now, only this building remained\nstanding. The only thing still intact in\nthe ruins was probably the chair that\nChin King Xhuang sat on. Sitting in the\nmiddle of the ruined hall, the king\nofQen looked expressionlessly at the\nthree people kneeling before him. Around\nhim stood a group of fierce looking\nservants who clearly did not look like\ngood people. Two of the three kneeling\nmen were servants sent by wei woo from\nhis home to help him. There's also\nmanager Hong. As for Yin Hong and\nChinglu, they weren't violated, but they\nwere tied up and hung in midair. One of\nthe servants originally wanted to take\nadvantage of the situation, but he was\nbeaten to death by Zhu Xwang before he\ncould even take his pants off. That's\nright. Zhu Xwangs servant was beaten to\ndeath by Zhu Xuang himself. No one knew\nwhy. Not even Zhu Xwangs servants knew\nwhy he had taken action. Anyway, after\nbeating the servant to death, Zhuang\nordered the two women to be hung up. Too\nslow. Really? Too slow? When will that\nguy named Wei Wu finally arrive? Zhu\nXwangs words sounded like both a\nquestion and a saliloquy, but this\nsimple sentence made manager Huang and\nthe two servants turn pale with fright.\nThere were originally four servants in\nthe shop, one of whom was sent back to\ndeliver a message to wei Wu. There were\noriginally three servants, but just now\nin the same situation, one of the\nservants spoke up and replied. As for\nthe outcome, just look at the number of\npeople in the store now. Unfortunately,\nmanager Hang and the servant guessed\nwrong again this time, seeing that\nmanager Huang and the other two remained\nsilent. Zhu Schwang did not say anything\neither. But one of his triangular-eyed\nservants stepped forward and shouted a\ncurse. \"You bunch of scoundrels, are you\ndeaf or mute? Didn't you hear his\nhighness, the prince ofQen, asking you a\nquestion?\" After saying that, the\ntriangular-eyed servant walked directly\nin front of manager Hong and his two\ncompanions, grabbed his servant, and\npulled him out. After throwing the\nservant to the ground, he took out a\nsmall knife and cut off the servant's\nleft ear. Amid the servant's screams,\nthe triangular henchman grabbed him by\nthe collar and grinned maliciously,\nsaying, \"If you're deaf, your ears are\nuseless, and if you're mute, you don't\nneed to keep your tongue.\" He he. As\nsoon as he finished speaking, several\nservants came out and held the servant's\narms and head up. Immediately\nafterwards, the triangular-eyed servant\ntook out a set of tools from his pocket\nthat had a chilling shape. The servant\nwas so frightened that his face turned\npale and his whole body trembled\nviolently. But no matter how much he\nstruggled, it was all in vain. Unable to\nresist, he was forcibly restrained by\nseveral servants, and his mouth was\npried open by a servant with triangular\neyes. Then the man with the triangular\neyes stuffed something that looked like\na hook into the servant's mouth. The\nsharp hook pierced the servant's tongue\nin an instant and then forcibly pulled\nit out. But that wasn't all. After\npulling out the tongue, the man with the\ntriangular eyes picked up the small\nknife again. With a cruel and\nbloodthirsty smile on his face, he\npressed the knife against his tongue.\nJust then, Wayi Wiu walked in from\noutside. Upon seeing this, he\nimmediately shook his arm up and down\nwithout saying a word. Click. The\nshotgun he was holding was cocked.\nChapter 125. Zhuang. He kills without\nblinking an eye. Even more brutal than\nme. Although the shotgun was loaded,\nWayi Wu did not point the muzzle at the\ntriangular eye. His servants were still\nin his hands. If he really shot one of\nthem, none of the five men would\nsurvive. Therefore, Weii Wu did not look\nat the servants, but instead focused his\ngaze on Zhu Xwang, who was sitting in a\nchair. I'm here. Release them. Zuwang\nturned his head, looked at Wayi Wu with\ndisdain, and then slowly said, \"Did you\nhear that?\" The Earl of Changangle said,\n\"You have to release the people.\" \"Yes,\nyour highness.\" After Zhu Schwang\nfinished speaking, the man with the\ntriangular eyes immediately turned\naround, bowed, and responded. However,\nthe next second, he suddenly swung the\nknife and cut off the servant's tongue.\nBlood gushed from the servant's mouth\ninstantly, staining his chest red.\nImmediately afterwards, the man with the\ntriangular eyes raised his foot and\nkicked the servant in the chest, sending\nhim flying before turning his head to\nlook at Wei Wu. Lord Chanlu, as you\nrequested, I have released a man. A\nfierce glint flashed in Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s\neyes, and he directly aimed the shotgun\nin his hand at the triangular man and\nhis servants. Very well, then I should\nreward you. Boom. A deafening gunshot\nrang out, and in an instant, hundreds of\nsmall steel balls were ejected from the\nshotgun. The man with the triangular\neyes standing not far away along with\nhis three servants happened to be within\nthe range of the steel balls. In an\ninstant, the bodies of the several\npeople burst open as if they were filled\nwith blood packs, and their bodies were\nimmediately stained red with blood. The\nhorrific bloody wounds were enough to\nsend chills down anyone's spine. Manager\nHong, take the person to the Imperial\nHospital and tell them that I am the one\nwho sent him. Do everything you can to\nsave him. After saying that, we wu\nshouted again towards the door, \"Bring a\nchair in.\" The groom came in from\noutside and placed the chair directly\nopposite Zhu Xwang, but we wu did not\nsit down. He glanced around the hall and\nsaw that Zhu Xwang had five servants. He\nthen walked directly toward one of them.\nSeeing this, Zhuang, who hadn't spoken\nsince Wayi Wu entered, finally couldn't\nhold back any longer. \"You kill my\nservant right in front of me, Wu. You\nhave quite the nerve.\" Although Zhu\nXuang did not roar or shout, his tone\nwas full of anger. Unfortunately, his\nanger might be effective on others, but\nit was completely useless against Wei\nWu. Wei Wu didn't even bother to pay him\nany attention and went to the servant on\nhis own. Click boom. Without saying a\nword, he came right up and fired a shot.\nAnd this time, he was very close before\nfiring. Shotguns are weapons whose power\nincreases dramatically with closer\nproximity. When Wayi Woo fired his\nspear, the blood that the servant spat\nout even flew onto his face. However, he\nwas too lazy to clean it and simply\ncarried the gun to the next target.\nThese people all smashed his shop, and\nsince they were with Zu Schwang, they\nprobably committed many evil deeds as\nwell. We wu felt no guilt whatsoever at\nkilling them. Seeing another of his\ncompanions killed, the man targeted by\nWei Wu was so terrified he wet himself.\nThis is not an adjective, but a\nstatement of fact. He witnessed his\ncompanions gruesome death firsthand\nwithout even being able to utter a\nscream. Now that it's his turn, how can\nhe not be afraid? As we Wu drew ever\ncloser, the servant had already decided\nto run away. But at that moment, King\nZhuwang ofQin suddenly roared, \"Enough!\"\nWeii Wu, \"Do you really not respect me?\"\nThe king ofQ. Ah! Click! Boom! In\nresponse to the king ofQen's roar, Weii\nWu fired a gunshot. The servant who had\noriginally planned to escape ultimately\ncould not escape a tragic death. At this\nmoment, the remaining three servants\nfinally realized what was happening.\nThey knew the king ofQen couldn't save\nthem, and their only chance of survival\nwas to flee immediately. However, the\nspeed of running can never outpace the\nspeed of pulling the trigger. Just as\nthe three servants turned around, Wayi\nWu reloaded his gun and pointed it at\nthem. He didn't fire immediately.\nInstead, he waited until the three men\nreached the doorway before pulling the\ntrigger. In this way, with just one\nshot, all three servants were taken\ndown, saving two bullets. After doing\nall this, Wayi Wu picked up a shotgun\nand sat down opposite Juwang. I heard\nyou just got back, and your dad beat you\nlike a grandson. Your injuries have\nbarely healed and you're already causing\ntrouble again. The key point is that you\nstill came to provoke me. Do you really\nthink everyone in the world is your\nfather and everyone will indulge your\nbad habits? Zhuang did not respond to\nWei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s provocative words, but\nstared intently at the shotgun. After\nscrutinizing him for a long time, he\nfinally raised his head to look at Wei\nWu. I don't believe you dare to kill me.\nStop spouting nonsense like that. It\nmakes you look stupid like you're going\nto kill me. Zuang squinted at Wei Wu but\ndid not refute what he said. That's\nright. Just as Wei Wu said, Zhuang\nreally didn't dare to kill Wei Wu. He\nwas cruel, not stupid. He knew his own\nfather's character better than anyone.\nThe playful fighting is fine. At worst,\nI'll get beaten half to death again.\nI've gotten used to it over the years.\nBut if Wayi Wu died, Zhu Xwang had a\nstrong premonition that he himself would\nnot survive either. He came here this\ntime only with the intention of venting\nhis anger. The reason they came to cause\ntrouble and vandalized Bihigh\nChaosing&lt;unk&gt;s building wasn't because\nhe was beaten up, but for other reasons.\nBefore coming, Zhuang had specifically\ninquired about Wei Wu and had some\nunderstanding of him. He was kind to\neveryone, whether they were Unix or\nservants in his own household. But now\nhe realizes that what he knew might be\nwrong. This ruthless and merciless style\nof killing has nothing to do with\nkindness. It's even more brutal than\nhim. Since he couldn't vent his anger\nnow, Zhuang decided not to stay here any\nlonger. He immediately got up and walked\ntowards the gate. But at that moment,\nWei Wu spoke up. Did I tell you to\nleave? Zhuang turned around and looked\nat Wayi Wu with a cold face. What? You\nthink you can kill me? Killing him\nwouldn't be the answer, but with things\nescalating to this point today, it's\nunlikely you'll escape and scathed. As\nhe spoke, Wayu put down a shotgun and\ntook out a stun gun, aiming it at Zuang.\nUpon seeing the strange weapon in Wei\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s hand, Zhuwang immediately had a\nbad feeling. But before he could make\nany move, Weii Wu had already pulled the\ntrigger. Moreover, it was a double tap\nwith two probes shooting out rapidly and\ninstantly attaching to Zhuang's body.\nThen a strong tingling sensation spread\nthroughout his body and Zhu Xwangs\nvision went black and he fainted on the\nspot. He didn't know how much time had\npassed, but when he woke up again, he\nfound himself in complete darkness like\na prison cell. He himself was also\ntightly chained and hung suspended in\nmidair. Zhuang tried to struggle, but\nthe result was obvious. It was\ncompletely feudal. Just then, Zhuang\nheard the sound of an iron gate being\nopened behind him. Then they heard Weii\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s voice. Don't try. This is the\nGinui prison. No matter how fierce\nsomeone is, they can't escape once\nthey're in. As they spoke, Weii Wu led\nShinlin and Jean Hai into the prison\ncell. After settling in, he looked at Zu\nSchwang, who was hanging in the air, and\nasked a question. If it was just about\ngetting beaten up, you wouldn't have\ncaused this mess. Tell me, what was it\nall for? Chapter 126. Zhu Xwang. Today,\nI'll show you what your name means. When\nasked by Wayi Wu, Zhu Xwangs response\nwas silence. That's right. It's silence.\nA complete you can say whatever you\nwant. I can't hear you attitude. In Zhu\nXwangs view, he would only suffer some\nphysical pain and it didn't matter as\nlong as he didn't die. However, what\nJuwang didn't know was that Wayi Wu\nalready knew he would have his attitude.\nI had made preparations before coming.\nSeeing Zhu Xwang remained silent. Weii\nWu simply chuckled and continued. Your\nhighness, I have a very interesting\nlittle gadget here. Let me show it to\nyou first. As he spoke, Wayi Wu took out\nhis phone from his pocket, turned on the\ncamera mode, and recorded a 20-se\nsecondond video. He then held the phone\nscreen in front of Zhu Xwang and clicked\nplay. Zhuang was initially shocked that\nsuch a lifelike painting could be found\non such a small black square. However,\nwhen he saw the painting changing and\nmoving, his eyes widened as if he had\nseen a ghost. The unknown is terrifying\nto people, and Zhuang was frightened by\nthe unknown before him. But this is just\nthe beginning, because what follows is\nthe continuous movement of the camera.\nZhuang saw herself on the phone screen,\nseeing herself suspended in midair. I'm\nstunned. I'm really terrified. Why am I\nin here? What evil magic have you used\nto return my soul? In fact, Wayi Wu's\noriginal intention was to let Zhu\nSchwang see the functions of a mobile\nphone. I was just laying the groundwork\nfor what I was going to do next. I never\nintended to use the camera function to\nintimidate people. However, Zhuang's\nreminder did make him somewhat tempted.\nIf you want your soul, then answer my\nquestions obediently or I will destroy\nthis wisp of your soul. As he spoke,\nWayi Wu opened the options interface and\nplaced his finger on the delete option.\nSee that word delete? Once I press it,\nyour soul will be completely erased.\nWeii Wu intended to intimidate Zhu Xwang\nin this way. But as soon as he finished\nspeaking, Zhuang narrowed his eyes. He\nthen adopted an indifferent attitude.\nThat seems to mean, \"Delete it if you\nwant.\" Upon seeing his attitude, Wayi Wu\nwas taken aback at first, but then\nimmediately understood the reason. He\ncouldn't help but curse himself\ninwardly. \"Damn it, I was careless. This\nguy knew I wouldn't kill him. So, how\ncould he possibly delete his soul? Never\nmind. Let's stick to the original plan.\nThinking of this, Wayi Wu simply took\nthe phone back and then spoke again. It\ncannot be denied that I can erase your\nsoul. But my artifact has a better\nfunction. It can record what happened\nand then replay it. You saw that just\nnow, right? After speaking, Wayi Wu\ncasually placed his phone on the table\nand then looked at you. Does your\nhighness, the prince ofqin, know of a\nsecret medicine called lotus love\nlonging powder? Upon hearing the words\nLotus love powder, a flash of anger\nappeared in Juwang&lt;unk&gt;s eyes. You dare?\nOh, it seems his highness the king ofQen\nis a man of action knowing how powerful\nthis thing is. Lotus love powder\noriginated from a martial arts\norganization called the Lotus sect\nduring the Sway and Tang dynasties. To\nbe honest, if physician Sue hadn't told\nhim himself, Wayi Wu wouldn't have known\nthat such good and bad things existed.\nThe so-called lotus love powder is\nactually just a potent drug specifically\nused to cultivate sexual techniques.\nHowever, this drug does not have an\naphrodesiac effect. It only causes\nconfusion and frenzy delirium. Physician\nSue said the following. The cause arises\nfrom a state of mental confusion and\ninfatuation, a state of blissful\nignorance, as if entering a divine\nrealm. Hearing words and following\nactions, desires drive the heart with\nendless longing. Her eyes brimming with\nlonging for her beloved, gaze upon him\nwith unrestrained grace, like the roots\nof a lotus hidden in the water. At\nfirst, physician Su was reluctant to\nreveal the prescription since this stuff\nwas extremely rare, especially for a\nwoman named Xiao Kaiwa. Weii Wu was also\nwicked. He didn't say who it was for,\nonly that it was used in the Ginui\nprison. So, physician Sue didn't hide\nanything. If he knew the truth, he\nprobably would never have told him. To\nbe honest, Wayi Wu didn't expect Zhu\nSchwang to be so angry when he heard\nabout the medicine. He was even angrier\nthan when he mistakenly thought he had\nbeen possessed, which way Wu found\nsomewhat strange. However, he didn't\nthink much of it and simply took out a\nmask from his pocket and put it on. Then\nshe took out a small paper packet and\ncarefully opened it. He picked up some\npowder with his fingernail, came to Zhu\nXwang, and flicked it with his finger,\nsprinkling the powder on Zhu Xwangs\nmouth and nose. Your highness, your name\nis Zhu Xwang. Today I will give you a\nchance to live up to your name. After\nspeaking, Wayi Wu turned to look at\nShinllin and Jean Hai behind him.\nActually, there was no other way but to\ncall them over. He needed manpower to\nhelp him. The problem was that the\nperson who wanted him to do it was the\nking ofQ. Without Ju&lt;unk&gt;s order, even\nMaoang wouldn't dare to get involved.\nNot to mention his own men, the Imperial\nguards, who had no choice but to call\nShaun Lin and Jean Hai over to help\nthem. Go bring in the big fat baby. I\nprepared for his highness, the king ofQ.\nUpon hearing Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s order, Shan\nLlin and Jean Hai looked puzzled, but\nstill went to the prison cell. Not long\nafter, shouts gradually approached from\noutside. Hiss, hiss. When the iron door\nof the cell opened again, a big fat\nwhite pig shoved its way in. The moment\nJuang saw the big fat pig, his eyes were\npractically overflowing with rage. He\nwas a prince of the Ming dynasty. When\nhad he ever suffered such humiliation,\nwho dare to insult him like this?\nHowever, the anger in one's heart is\nultimately unable to resist the\nphysiological effects of the drugs.\nLooking at the big fat white pig in\nfront of him, Zhuwang inexplicably felt\na sense of refined elegance. Seeing that\nZhuwang was already in his own, Wayi Wu\nimmediately had Shin Lin and the others\nsecure the big fat pig. They then put Zu\nSchwang down, untied the chains binding\nhim, leaving only a loop of hemp rope\nstill binding him. After finishing their\nbusiness, the three of them immediately\nleft the cell. Fortunately, they acted\nquickly enough. Just as the large iron\ngate closed, Zhuang managed to snap the\nrope open. Standing outside the door,\nWayi Wu held up his phone and filmed the\nscene inside the cell through the\nventilation window. Shunlin and Janghai\nalso joined in the fun, but they weren't\nas carefree as Weii Wu. While watching\nthe spectacle, Shan couldn't resist\nasking a question. Young master, is this\nreally the right thing to do? What if\nhis majesty finds out and blames you?\nRelax. I really think he could have\ngotten rid of the pig. That pig had\nalready been tampered with. It was\nplugged up. Otherwise, it wouldn't have\nbeen screaming so pitifully. Just as Wei\nWu was speaking,Qin King Xhuang in the\nprison cell had already torn all his\nclothes to shreds. Upon seeing this, Wei\nWu immediately perked up. Getting\nexcited. Let's&lt;unk&gt; watch the show. Upon\nhearing Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s reminder, Shunlin\nand Jeang Hai quickly looked into the\nprison cell. At this point, King Zhuang\nAin was completely naked and looked even\nwhiter than that pig. Under the\ninfluence of the lotus love potion,\nZhuwang in a fit of rage strode toward\nthe large fat pig. Chapter 1 127. Your\nhighness, are you impotent? Wait a\nminute, young master. What's wrong with\nthe king ofQen? He's not making a sound\nat all. Outside the iron gate, as the\nthree were watching with great interest,\nJean Hai suddenly blurted out a\nsentence. This statement led both Wei Wu\nand Shan Llin to discover problem.\nJudging from Chin King Zhu Schwang's\nexpression and state, he was clearly\naffected by the lotus lovesickness\npowder. But his reaction showed no lust\nwhatsoever. Instead, it was all\nviolence. It doesn't feel like they're\ntrying to do anything, but rather like\nthey're trying to kill something. Most\nimportantly, as a man, he showed no sign\nof standing up. Seeing this, Wu couldn't\nhelp but feel uneasy. Is there something\nwrong with the medicine Lao Su gave me?\nBut looking at Zu Schwang's current\ncondition, the medicine seems fine.\nBecause the opponent is a fat pig, but\nhe's clearly under the influence of\ndrugs. He wouldn't care what it is. Just\nas Wei Wu and the other two were\nwondering what was going on, Zhuang\narrived in front of the big fat pig.\nImmediately afterwards, Zhu Xwangs arms\nwere seen pressing down on the fat pig.\nTo be honest, at this point, we Wu and\nthe others had no idea what Zhuang was\nup to, but it's definitely not dry. Then\nto the horror of the three men, Zhuang\ngrabbed the fat pig's skin and punched\nit. The large fat pig, which was pinned\ndown, couldn't even struggle and could\nonly passively endure the powerful\npunch. Immediately afterwards, Weii Woo\nand his men finally witnessed what\nbrutality truly meant. A whole fat pig\nwas torn into strips of meat by Zhu\nSchwang's violent attack. Blood and\nflesh were flung everywhere, and the\nentire cell was filled with a rusty,\nbloody stench. Zhuwang was completely\nsoaked in pig's blood, turning into a\nblood soaked figure. That wasn't the end\nof it. The pig livers and hearts he had\nthrown on the ground also met their end.\nOnly after he had ground all of them\ninto minced meat did he slowly sit down\nagainst the wall and look at the iron\ngate. Weii Woo, you have humiliated me\nso much today. If you have the guts,\nlock me up for life, otherwise I will\ndefinitely kill you. We Wu paid no\nattention to Zhu Xuang&lt;unk&gt;s threat. Not\nonly did he not care, he even pushed\nopen the iron door of the cell and went\ninside. Shunlin and Jeang Hai tried to\nstop him, but he refused and wouldn't\nlet them follow. He also issued an order\nthat the two men should stay three Jeang\naway from the prison gate and not\napproach without his permission. After\nentering the cell, Weii Wu dragged a\nrelatively clean chair and sat down\nabout 4 meters away from Zhuang. Zhuang\nwatched coldly the whole time and did\nnot make a move against Wei Wu as he\napproached because he knew very well\nthat he couldn't do it, he had already\nused up a lot of energy just now by\ntearing that pig apart. The key point is\nthat although we woo was sitting, he was\nholding that strangely shaped weapon in\nhis hand and he was pointing it at him.\nHe had tried this thing before and found\nit impossible to resist, so he figured\nhe might as well save his energy. The\ntwo stared at each other for a long time\nbefore Wei Woo finally spoke. Can't you\ncontrol yourself? Do you only get\npleasure from violence? Control? I was\nborn a demon. Why should I control\nmyself? Can you control yourself to stop\neating and drinking? Weiiu didn't speak,\nbut stared at Juwang for a while,\npondering for a long time. Then he\nslowly opened his mouth and asked a\nquestion. Are you not good enough? These\nseven simple words seemed to have\ntouched Zhu Schwang&lt;unk&gt;s sore spot,\ncausing him to fly into a rage on the\nspot. \"Asshole!\" he roared and was about\nto get up and attack, but Wei Wu raised\nthe stun gun in his hand instead. \"Hey,\ndon't move. My weapon doesn't have eyes.\nAnd besides, why are you so agitated?\nI'm not joking with you. I'm asking you\nsomething very seriously. If it is, it\nis. If it isn't, it isn't. Zhu Xwang\nstiffened, looking at Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s\nexpression and tone, which didn't seem\nto be mocking him. With the added threat\nof the stun gun, he relaxed and sat back\ndown. So what? Whether I'm good or not\nis none of your business. When faced\nwith this question, what is the first\nreaction of a normal man? It's to refute\nit and emphasize how capable he is. Zhu\nSchwang's answer was clearly an attempt\nto evade the issue and avoid facing it.\nSo as soon as he finished speaking, Weii\nWu understood. At the same time, another\npossibility came to mind. Could it be\nthat Zu Schwang was so cruel because he\nwas impotent in this area? The principle\nis the same as with Unix. Many Unix who\nwielded power shared the same hobby. He\nwould marry and take concubines like a\nnormal person and then torture the women\nin various ways because they are normal\npeople with normal human desires. But\nsomething is missing and their desires\ncannot be expressed. They can only find\nspiritual satisfaction in other ways. If\nZhuwang was also in this situation, they\nwould explain why he became cruel.\nHistorical records indicate that Zhu\nSchwang was intelligent and stern in his\nyouth, but became cruel after he was in\ntheft. At first, the FFTM was just a\nlarge-scale construction project, which\ncan only be described as a waste of\nmanpower and resources. He only became\ncruel later, and there's a crucial\npoint. His principal wife was\nimprisoned. His brutal acts were often\ncommitted in connection with his\nconcubine, Lady Ding, and many of the\nthings he did were done for her. At this\nmoment, we wu couldn't help but have a\ndoubt. Zhuang was cruel because he was\nno longer capable of good deeds. When he\nwas capable, he wasn't a good person,\nbut he wasn't that outrageous either.\nLater, he couldn't continue. To put it\nsimply, his sexual frustration turned\nhim into a pervert. And that dang family\nmember was no good either. Otherwise,\nshe wouldn't have taken pleasure in\nabusing her servants. If a concubine\nwants to rise to the position of\nprincipal wife, she naturally has to win\nover the principal wife and at the same\ntime go to great lengths to make the\nking ofQen like her more. A powerful\npervert and a sickopantic scoundrel. The\noutcome of their pairing is\nself-evident. Of course, these are all\nWei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s speculations, and only\npractice can prove them. Looking at\nJuwan again, Wei Wu smiled, but his tone\nwas anything but joking. Do you want to\nsolve this problem, turning impossible\ninto possible or even very possible or\nexceptionally possible? Was Zu Schwang\ncapable or not? The answer is no. He\ndidn't know what was happening to him.\nHe just felt there was an obstacle and\nhe just didn't feel right. As a man and\na prince at that, how could he possibly\naccept such a thing? Over the years,\nI've tried various methods, countless\nmedications, and doctors, but there's\nbeen no improvement whatsoever.\nTherefore, we wu&lt;unk&gt;s words did not\nstir any emotion in him at all because\nhe was already used to disappointment.\nSeeing that Zhuang did not answer him,\nWu was not in a hurry and directly took\nout a small blue tablet from the\nwarehouse. I originally intended to peel\none, but then I thought about it and\ndecided to peel two to be on the safe\nside. Wayu casually tossed two pills in\nfront of Zuwang before speaking again.\nI'm the only one in the world who has\nthis medicine. It is a special treatment\nfor this kind of problem and it has\nmiraculous effects. The shop you smashed\nup sells this stuff. So, your highness,\ndo you dare to give it a try? Chapter\n128. Zuwang. I'm really feeling terrible\nright now. In fact, from the very\nbeginning, Wayi Wu never intended to use\nviolence against Zuwang because using\nviolence to suppress violence would be\nutterly useless. This can be seen from\nZhu Yuan Jangs education of Zhu Xwang,\nbeating him severely would be of no use.\nIn fact, for someone like Zhu Xwang,\nusing violence to control violence is\nnot as effective as winning his heart\nand mind. However, finding Zhu Xwangs\npoint of view was difficult, which is\nwhy we Wu thought of using humiliation\nto force him. However, unexpectedly,\nthis force situation brought out the key\npoint. As for whether is true or not, we\nonly need to see if Zhu Xwang eats the\ntwo pills on the ground to find out. As\nit turned out, Weii Wu&lt;unk&gt;s guess was\ncorrect. After a brief hesitation, Zhu\nXuang ignored the blood stains on the\nground and picked up the small blue\npiece stained with pigs blood. After\nputting it in my mouth, I chewed it into\npowder and swallowed it with my saliva.\nIt has to be said that seeing this\nscene, Wayi Wu truly admired this\nruthless person's actions. After Zhu\nXwang swallowed the small blue pill, the\ncell became even quieter than before.\nZhu Xuangs behavior has confirmed his\ncondition and now he doesn't know what\nto say, so he can only remain silent.\nWayu is also well aware that anything he\nsaid now would have the opposite effect.\nOnly when the little blue tablet has\nfully taken effect will it be the right\ntime for him to speak. And so two silent\npeople sat, one in a chair and the other\non the floor. If outsiders saw this, it\nwould be quite an eyesore. Fortunately,\nno one else can come in here. Time\npassed slowly and soon about 20 minutes\nhad gone by. Zhuang, who had been\nexpressionless, suddenly raised his head\nin a double sense. He looked at Weii Wu,\nhis eyes no longer filled with anger and\nmurderous intent, but with an\nindescribable emotion. When Wei Wu saw\nthe expression on his face, a smile\ncurve his lips. \"Looks like it worked.\"\nZhu Schwang didn't speak, but his head\nkept nodding up and down like he was\npounding garlic. Those who have never\nlost something will never understand the\npain, nor can they comprehend the\nexcitement of regaining it. At this\nmoment, there was neither the king ofQen\nnor the son of the Han Wu emperor in the\nprison cell. Yes, it was a man who was\nreborn and could hold his head high\nagain. Seeing Zhu Xwangs behavior as if\nhe had acquired a new toy and kept\nmanipulating it, we wu took the\nopportunity to ask another question. How\ndo you feel now? Zuang raised his head\nand immediately gave his answer. Hard?\nIs it hard? Tough enough? Zhu Xwang\nnodded vigorously again, repeating his\nprevious answer. And then Weii Wu said,\n\"Whether it's tough or knock and wait,\nright now you should only be thinking\nabout one thing. Getting your\ndescendants to fly.\" After saying that,\nWayi Wu grinned and then added another\nsentence. \"But not now. We should\nresolve our own issues first. Once\nthat's settled, you can go back and\nenjoy being the princess.\" Zhu Xwang,\nwho was initially quite excited, froze\nupon hearing these words. After a moment\nof silence, I heard his complicated\ntone. There is no princess anymore. I\nonly learned after I came to the capital\nby imperial decree that my father had\nordered the death of my second wife,\nDing. Upon hearing this, Wayi Wu was\nstunned. No wonder this guy was so angry\nthat he smashed up the Beehive Chowing\nbuilding. Now you know the reason. Old\nZu was ruthless. He had just called his\nson back when he issued an edict to kill\nhis daughter-in-law. That makes sense.\nOld Jew was probably furious inside,\nthinking that his son's bad behavior was\ninextricably linked to this woman.\nActually, Wayi Wu was also very curious.\nAnd taking advantage of the opportunity,\nhe asked a question. I mean, no harm. I\njust want to ask, if you don't like the\nprincipal wife, you can just ignore her.\nSo, why imprison her? There are few\nrecords of Zhu Xwangs principal wife in\nofficial history. It is only said that\nshe was the sister of Wong Bao Bao, a\nfamous general of the Yuan dynasty. Then\nher relationship with Zhu Xwang soured\nand she was imprisoned by Zhu Xwang and\nDeng Shir who only gave her some rotten\nfruit for each meal. In the end, Zhu\nXwang was poisoned to death and Wong\nShir was also buried alive with him, but\nit was never said whether it was\nvoluntary or involuntary. However, Wayi\nWu guessed that it was not voluntary.\nAfter all, who would willingly die for\nsomeone they didn't love or have\nfeelings for? Weii Wu was just curious.\nBut Zu Schwang, who was in a good mood,\nimmediately became angry again upon\nhearing about the Empress. That\nif it weren't for her, I wouldn't be\nlike this. If it weren't for my father's\nforbidding it, I would have killed her\nlong ago. Although Zhu Xwang did not say\nit explicitly, this statement revealed a\nlot of information. As expected, when\nZhuang said things that turn out this\nway, he was probably referring to his\ninability to perform. However, Wayi Wu\ndidn't ask about the specific details,\nbut instead inquired about the matter of\nthe secondary consort. Deng Schwang, is\nit your own interest or the Deng\nfamily's interest to torment those\nservants in your FFT? Of course, it's my\nown interest. I've already said I was\nborn a demon. My beloved concubine is\nwith me only so that I won't keep\nthinking about this. Can I leave now?\nDon't rush. To be honest, Wayi Wu felt\nthere were still some problems with Zhu\nXuang&lt;unk&gt;s answer. However, he seemed\nto have already made up his mind, and no\nmatter how much you asked, you couldn't\nget any more information out of him.\nAfter thinking for a moment, Wayi Wu got\nup and went outside, asking Shinllin to\nbring him a set of clothes. He then gave\nsome instructions before taking the\nclothes back to his cell and handing\nthem to Zhuang. Schwang, don't overthink\nwhat happened today. In fact, it was\nyour father-in-law who dumped you on me\nso I could teach you a lesson. We became\nfriends through a fight, and the problem\nthat's troubling you is one that only I\ncan solve for you. In that case, let's\nmake a deal. I'll supply this medicine\nlong-term. Of course, you'll have to pay\nme, but your family is big and you're\nnot short of money anyway. At this\npoint, Wayi Wiu took out the medicine\nfrom earlier and threw it into Zhu\nXwangs hand. Then he continued speaking,\nand you must promise me two things.\nDuring this time, use your energy to\ntorment women instead of tormenting\ninnocent servants. At least it will ease\nyour father's worries. Secondly, when\nthe Ming Dynasty launches its Eastern\nexpedition against the Japanese pirates,\nyou will also go to the battlefield with\nthem. You say you were born a demon and\nare beyond redemption, but I think\nthere's no point in bullying the weak\nand tormenting your own people. I have\nan idea for you. Go and double cross the\nenemy. Use your brutality to torment the\nMing dynasty's enemies. You'll have your\nfun and you won't be remembered with\ninfamy. At this point, Wayi Woo couldn't\nhelp but reach out and cover his\nforehead. Besides, I've already given\nyou those clothes. Can't you just put\nthem on? Even if you don't want to wear\nthem, at least turn around. Why the hell\ndo you keep pointing that thing at me?\nI'm not a woman. Upon hearing this, a\nrare hint of embarrassment flashed\nacross Zhu Xwangs face, and she quickly\ngrabbed her clothes and put them on.\nOnly then did Wei Wu lower his hand and\nlook at Zhu Xwang with a serious\nexpression, asking a question. So, is it\na deal? As long as father agrees, I\ndon't care. It's just going to\nbattlefield. Can I go now? If you agree,\nI'll go and tell them. Also, I hope you\ncan restrain your demonic thoughts and\nrelease them all at once when we get to\nthe Japanese pirates. As they were\ntalking, Zhuang had already dressed and\nthen looked at Wayi Wu. Okay, can I go\nnow? Seeing Wayi Wu noded, Zhuang ran\naway for the prison cell. Not long after\nZhuang left, Shunlin and Jean Hai also\nrushed back. Young master, we have\ninvestigated the matter you entrusted to\nus. Just as you guessed, the Deng\nfamily's wickedness is even greater than\nthat of the king ofQen. Chapter 129, the\nwedding night. Unleashing all his life\nskills. Although he had already guessed\nit, Weii Wu still sighed when he heard\nthe answer. He had previously felt that\nthe Deng family seemed a bit too\nunrealistic in Zu Schwang's description.\nIt looks like it's been enhanced with\nbeauty filters, skin smoothing, and\nexfoliation. That's why Shinlin and his\nmen were sent to the prince ofQin's\nresidence where they used old Jews name\nto force him to reveal the truth. After\nShinlin and his team's investigation,\nthe truth was immediately revealed. Deng\nwas a born wicked person. She not only\nabused the servants with Zhuang, but she\nwas even more vicious in private. Even\nthe infamous punishment of being turned\ninto a human pig, which was universally\ncondemned, was brought up three or four\ntimes by the Deng family. However, these\nthings were all done in private, and no\none dared to leak a word of them. Then,\nin front of Zhu Xwang, she acted like a\ngentle wife, doing everything for Zhu\nXuang. Even Zhuang himself thought so.\nIn reality, those servants prefer to\nstay by Zhu Xwangs side rather than be\nsummoned by Deng. At most, Zhu Schwang\nwould suffer. If summoned by Deng, he\nwould basically lose his life. Now that\nDeng has been sentenced to death by Zhu\nYuan Jang, it can be considered as\neliminating a scourge for the people and\neradicating a demon on Earth. After\nleaving the Ginui prison, Wei Wu ordered\nShinllin and Jean Hai to leave. They're\ngoing to sue Joe on business tomorrow,\nso they're taking this opportunity to\nrelax. Upon returning home, Wei Wu saw\nthat manager Huang had already come back\nand immediately asked him a question.\nWhat did the Imperial Medical Academy\nsay? Reporting to the young master, the\nImperial Hospital says his life is not\nin danger, but he will never be able to\nspeak again. Having already guessed this\noutcome, we woo could only sigh. Sigh.\nLet him recover well and come back when\nhe's healed. Also, let's allocate more\nmoney from the treasury to compensate\nhim. That's all way Wu could do in this\nmatter. The wicked servant who made the\nmove has already been killed by him. As\nfor Zhuang, this is ancient times. The\nidea that princes are subject to the\nsame laws as commoners is just something\nto be taken with a grain of salt. No\nemperor in any dynasty ever actually did\nthat. Zhuang was a prince and the\nservant was a slave. Their identities\nalready predetermined their fate.\nPutting that matter aside, Wei Wu then\ninquired about the shop. How has\nbusiness been in our shop lately? Upon\nhearing Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s question, manager\nHuang&lt;unk&gt;s face showed a timid\nexpression. Young master, I am\nincompetent. We haven't sold a single\npill of our medicine. The customers all\nleft as soon as they heard the price.\nManager Huang was worried about being\npunished by Wei Wu, but in fact, Wei Wu\nhad already anticipated this outcome.\nMoreover, he had already prepared\ncountermeasures. In that case, you\nshould make an appointment with the\nmadams of the other 13 floors of the\nChinuai River. Professional matters\nshould be handled by professionals. At\nthat time, each madam will give them one\npill and tell them to give it as a free\ngift when a big spender pays. Then we\nput some in their building clearly\npriced at 10 tales per piece, and they\ncan take a 10% cut of each one they\nsell. Manager Huangs eyes lit up as soon\nas he heard this. And he even cursed\nhimself inwardly for thinking of finding\nthose brothel owners. But then I\nthought, even if I went to them, those\nmadams probably wouldn't pay any\nattention to me. Just then, Wayi Wu\ndiscerned his thoughts and then said,\n\"If I handle this in my name, they won't\ndare to refuse. Otherwise, let them\nthink about how May Yanlu disappeared.\nYes, young master. With your method, I\nwill definitely not let you down this\ntime and we'll make the business a\nsuccess. Time flies like an arrow and in\nthe blink of an eye, the day of Chow\nChow's wedding arrived. During this\nperiod, the Institute of Science and\nTechnology made rapid progress. All the\ncomponents of a steam engine have been\ncompleted, and only the final boiler is\nmissing. Wayi Wu was so busy with\neverything that he didn't have a moment\nto rest. Besides the Academy of\nSciences, the wedding ceremony\nprocedures also exhausted him. First,\nthe proposal was accepted and the gifts\nand petitions were brought to the palace\nand presented to Zu Yuan Ja. Then came\nthe naming ceremony and the banquet for\nthe son-in-law. Next, they would need to\nconsult the apicious omens matching the\nbirth dates and times of Xu Yuan and Wei\nWu and then present betroal gifts to the\nprincess. After going back and forth to\nthe palace more than a dozen times, we\nhave finally arrived at today's wedding\nday. At the request of the officials of\nthe Ministry of Rights, Chow Chow's\nresidence was decorated with red ribbons\nand colorful decorations, creating a\nfestive atmosphere. Waking up early in\nthe morning, Weii Wu, with the help of\nseveral maids, put on a handsome wedding\noutfit. Riding a white horse, he led the\nwedding procession from the mansion to\nthe palace to fetch his bride. The\npalace held a special banquet to\nentertain the wedding procession. While\nWeii Wu and Zhu Yuswan came to see the\nemperor. After entering the main hall,\nthey went through another complicated\nand frustrating process that Wei Wu\ncompletely didn't understand. After the\nceremony was over, Unic Wong held the\nimperial edict and read aloud. We didn't\nlisten to a word of what came before,\nbut he listened with great interest to\nwhat came after. special bestow. 10,000\ntales of gold, 80,000 tales of silver,\n80,000 strings of paper money, and 100\nhectares of fertile land. 20 bolts each\nof silk gauze and damisk, 30 bolts each\nof raw and processed silk, a set of\nseladone and white jade cups carved with\ncrane patterns, and a white jade ruy\nknot. Six pairs of dragon and phoenix\ngold bracelets along with gold and\nsilver jewels will be given as part of\nthe dowy. So be it. Upon hearing the\nseries of dowies, Weii Wu thought to\nhimself, \"Old Zu is really rich.\"\nYusian&lt;unk&gt;s dowy was the most generous\namong princesses, equaling the sum of\nWeii Wu&lt;unk&gt;s two previous rewards. But\nthat's not all. After the formalities at\nthe palace are completed, the princess\nwill ride in a sedan chair and return to\nher residence with her husband.\nNormally, this would end at the palace\nand then Wei Wu's side would take the\nlead. However, this is clearly not the\nnormal situation. When Wei Wu took Zu\nYuan away from the palace, Crown Prince\nZhu Bao personally escorted his younger\nsister to her wedding. Not only the\nCrown Prince, but also the second prince\nZhuang and the fourth prince Zhu D\naccompanied their sisters to their\nweddings. After the wedding procession\nreturned home and the banquet began,\nsomething even more terrifying happened.\nZhu Yuan Jang, dressed in a dragon robe,\narrived at Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s residence with\nEmpress Ma, who was dressed in Empress's\nattire. We didn't know many people in\nthe Ming dynasty, so his wedding banquet\nwasn't very big. Among those who came\nwere Lu, Maang, and physician Su, who\nwere people with whom they had a good\nrelationship. Then there were the\nimperial guards who had been protecting\nhim around the mansion. They also\ninvited him to a wedding feast. But no\none expected that when we Wu got\nmarried, the emperor would actually\nbring his whole family. Fortunately, Zhu\nYuan Jang and Empress Ma did not linger.\nThey merely made a brief appearance to\nconvey their stance before departing.\nWhen entertaining guests later, Weii Wu,\nwho was not a heavy drinker, did not\ndrink much. However, he did bring out\nseveral bottles of Matai to entertain\nthose who came to congratulate him.\nAfter drinking a few small cups, he\npretended to be drunk and acted like a\nrogue, leaving everyone behind and\ncoming to the bridal chamber. After all,\nall of that outside socializing is\nineffective. The one inside is the\neffective socializing. To prevent being\noverheard, Wu made a point of shouting\nbefore entering the room. Don't blame me\nfor not warning you beforehand. Anyone\nwho ees drops on me, don't blame me for\nsummoning thunder. With an excited heart\nand trembling hands, she pushed open the\ndoor to the bridal chamber, then closed\nit behind her. Looking at the pretty\nfigure wearing a red veil by the\nbedside, Wu picked up the jade Rui on\nthe table. He came to the bedside and\nslowly lifted Zu Yusu&lt;unk&gt;s red veil to\none side. Zu Yusuan, already as\nbeautiful and radiant as a flower,\nlooked breathtakingly gorgeous in her\nwedding dress. After Weii Wu sat down,\nXiushuan slowly rested her head on Wei\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s shoulder. My husband Yusuan has\nfinally married you as she wished. Weii\nWu overjoyed reached out and embraced\nZhu Yuan, whispering softly in her ear,\nhis breath warm against her skin. My\nlady, it's getting late. We should rest.\nZu Yushuan's delicate body trembled. And\nthen she uncontrollably collapsed onto\nthe wedding bed. That night, Wayi Wu\nfinally put to use all the knowledge he\nhad acquired over the past 20 years.\nExamples include the Azure Dragon\nabsorbing water technique, the mighty\ndragon claw hand, the fluid smoothing\nflower picking finger, the extendable\nspear, and so on. From this moment on,\nhe finally became a real man. Chapter\n130. The night of Wei Wu's wedding was\nalso the night of the extermination of\nthe Lu clan. There are many ways to\nbecome a man. Some do it through blood\nand passion while others do it through\nblood and battle. While Weii Wu was\npreparing to have someone reincarnated,\nShunlin and the others were also\npreparing to have someone reincarnated.\nThe distance from Beijing to Sujo is not\nfar. Disregarding the terrain, it's only\nabout 200 km as the crow flies, but this\nis ancient times. And more importantly,\nShan Linn and his group are not\ntraveling in a grand manner. Although\nthey carried the identity of the\nembroidered uniform guard, it was only\nto avoid the trouble of having to obtain\ntravel permits. In fact, in order to\ncomplete the task assigned by Wei Wu,\nShunlin and his group kept a very low\nprofile while traveling. After all, 12\nImperial guards traveling from the\ncapital to Sujo at breakneck speed were\ntoo conspicuous. It must be said that\nShan's decision was correct. Although it\ntook a while, they did not reveal their\nidentities until they entered Sujo. For\nthe past 2 days, Shanun has been\nsecretly investigating the Lou family,\nhoping to find the evidence we woo\nwanted. Unfortunately, several days\npassed and he found no clues from either\nthe White Lotus sect or Tufu. Pinglu is\none of the largest insu.\nAfter arriving in Sujo, the impermanent\nsquad chose to settle down there.\nHowever, they usually acted separately.\nBut tonight, everyone gathered in\nShunllin's room. Brothers, we've been in\nSujo for several days now, and we still\nhaven't made any progress on the task\nthe young master assigned us. Today is\nthe young master's wedding day, and I\nhave decided to wipe out the Lou family\ntonight as a wedding gift for the young\nmaster. Check your weapons and load your\nammunition drums. It's 3:45 p.m. now.\nYou have 1 minute to prepare. will\ndepart promptly at 4:45 p.m. Upon\nhearing Shinllin's order, the members of\nthe impermanent squad got up and\nreturned to their rooms to tidy up. 15\nminutes later, the 12 people quietly\nleft the restaurant through the back\ndoor and disappeared into the night.\nShinllin's choice of Pinion Tower as his\nresidence was not random because it was\nthe closest to the Garden Mansion of the\nLou family. After evading the city\nguards who patrolled the streets late at\nnight, the group quickly arrived near\nthe Lou family's residence. I'll lead\nthree men to attack from the front gate.\nJean Hai will lead three men to attack\nfrom the back gate and the rest of us\nwill guard the side gates and entrances.\nRemember, if you encounter the head of\nthe Lou family, capture him alive if\npossible. As for the others in this\nhouse, at this point, a fierce glint\nflashed in Shunllin's eyes, and he\nraised his hand as if to slit his\nthroat. The other team members\nimmediately nodded in understanding, and\nthen Shunlin made another gesture. The\nnext second, all 12 members of the\nimpermanent squad took out a black\nknitted headgear and put it on. It has\nto be said that the automatic rifles and\nknitted headgear instantly gave the\nimpermanent squad a more ruthless bandit\naura. Let's do it. At Shan&lt;unk&gt;s\ncommand, the 12 people immediately\ndispersed in an orderly manner. After\neveryone had left, Shanun led his men to\nthe wall by the gate. Then the two of\nthem joined hands and lifted Shunlin\nonto the wall with ease. As soon as he\nlanded, Shunlin ran quickly to the\ngatekeeper's resting spot and used a\nknife to slit the man's throat, thus\nfinishing him off. They then unlatched\nthe door, let the three team members in,\nand then locked the door again. After\nentering the house, Shunlin and his\ngroup did not take action immediately,\nbut instead waited in front of the door\nfor something. After a few minutes, a\ngunshot suddenly rang out in the silent\nnight. Bang! Do it! Upon hearing the\ngunshot, Shan Llin immediately ordered\nthe attack to begin. The four men\nsimultaneously raised their automatic\nrifles, cocked them, and cocked them\nwith practiced ease. However, because of\nthe gunshot, the servants patrolling the\nLou residence at night also heard it.\nMany servants who were already asleep\nwere also awakened and candles were lit\nin some rooms. They were unaware of what\nhad happened until Shan Lin and his\ngroup officially took action. Starting\nfrom the lobby, everything went smoothly\nas we walked through the corridor. But\nwe encountered someone right where the\nancient trees intertwined. Who goes\nthere? A loud shout rang out and six\nguards carrying oil lamps met Shanlin\nand his group headon at the corner of\nthe corridor. Five of the guards were\ncarrying fire and water sticks while the\nlast one carried a gong. Upon seeing\nShenllin and his group, the guard\nholding the gong immediately smashed it\nwith a stick.\nAt the same time the gong was struck,\nShanlin and the other three also fired\ntheir guns. At such close range, Shanun\nLinn and his men didn't waste a single\none of their six bullets, and the guards\nwere killed on the spot. Several\ngunshots and the sound of gongs seemed\nto signal something. Gunshots rang out\nintermittently throughout the Lou\nresidence, finally alarming everyone\ninside. Even Lu E, who was sleeping with\nhis concubine, was suddenly awakened\nfrom his bed. What happens? After\nshoving the bewildered concubine aside,\nLu shouted towards the door as he put on\nhis clothes. Then the servant's reply\nwas heard. Master, the night patrol gong\nhas been sounded. It must be a thief\nbreaking into the house. Please do not\ncome out. While the servants outside\nwere talking, Lou, he had already put on\nhis clothes and opened the door.\nImmediately send someone to the Yammen\nto find the prefect and also notify the\ncity defense patrols to come over. Yes.\nThe servant turned to go about his work,\nbut at that moment, another servant ran\ninto Luie's courtyard. Master, something\nterrible has happened. A lot of thieves\nhave broken into the house, and we can't\nget out. All the doors have been blocked\nby the thieves. Just now, Lu Z was about\nto go out to find the patrolling\nsoldiers, but as soon as he got close to\nthe back door, he heard a sound and Lu Z\nwas dead. Oh no, they're coming for me.\nAfter listening to the servants's words,\nLui's eyes narrowed and he immediately\nrealized that things were not simple.\nThis is Sujo. Even the most notorious\nbandits and robbers would only target\nremote villages or small towns. Anyone\nwho dares to cause trouble in a big city\nlike Sujo is clearly targeting me.\nThinking of this, Lu E quickly turned to\nlook at the servant who had just\nentered. Where is third master? Is he\nhome? Master, I rushed here to find you.\nBut I haven't seen third master. Then\nhurry up and go find it. Once you find\nit, call the third brother to my study.\nAlso, notify all the guards to stand\nwatch in my courtyard. Upon hearing\nLui's order, the two servants dared not\nlinger and turned to run out of the\ncourtyard. After the two left, Lu ran\nquickly toward the study without saying\na word. Just as he arrived at the study\ndoor and was about to open it, he saw Lu\nGoo running towards him. Brother, what\nhappened? The house was burgled. Why are\nyou running to the study and calling me\nover? Don't speak. Come in with me. Upon\nhearing Lugu's voice, Lu E grabbed his\nclothes without saying a word and drag\nhim into the study. After closing the\ndoor, Lu E instructed Lugu to guard it\nand then went to the secret passage\nalone. However, when he tried to open\nthe secret passage, he found that the\ndoor seemed to be blocked. No matter how\nhe turned the mechanism, the hidden door\nremained unresponsive. Just as Lu was\nwondering what was going on, he\ndiscovered a note tucked into the hidden\ndoor. Wait for reinforcements. Be\ncareful what you say, Lu Yao, the young\nmaster of Sai Tower in Yong Joe. You'd\nbetter watch yourself. Upon seeing the\ncontents of the note, Lu e trembled\nviolently and his face turned deathly\npale. Brother, what are you looking at?\nLet's go. The thieves will be here soon.\nHearing Lugu's voice behind him, Lu he\nstuffed the note into his mouth without\nsaying a word. They didn't even have\ntime to chew before they had to force\nthemselves to swallow. Chapter 131.\nDesperate situation. The demise of the\nLu clan. Lugu was stunned when he saw\nthis scene. He clearly saw that his\nolder brother was holding a piece of\npaper, but he couldn't make out what was\nwritten on it. But what really puzzled\nhim was that his older brother had\nswallowed the paper. This is clearly\nsomeone guarding against him. Guarding\nagainst him. Who is his own brother?\nAfter a moment, Lugu came to his senses\nand suppressing his emotions asked the\nquestion, \"Big brother, what you just\ndid?\" Third brother, don't ask. There\nare some things your elder brother\ndoesn't want you to know. actually to\nprotect you. Before Lu could finish\nspeaking, Lu Ei suddenly interrupted\nhim. Lugu wanted to ask more, but Lu Ei\ndidn't give him the chance and said\ndirectly, \"Let's go. The thieves are\nprobably coming soon. Let's find a way\nto get out of here first.\" After saying\nthat, Lu E did not hesitate at all and\nstrode out of the study. Seeing this,\nLugu had no choice but to follow along,\nfilled with doubt. Although he didn't\nknow what his older brother meant, he\nknew very well that his brother wouldn't\nharm him. And now is definitely not the\ntime to talk about this. After leaving\nthe study, Lou immediately led Lu Goo\nand the other man quickly towards his\ncourtyard. He originally planned to have\nhis guards gather in his own courtyard\nto draw the thieves attention. He could\nhave taken his brother away through the\nsecret passage, but the people below\nsealed the door shut. In the end, not\nonly was he unable to leave, but he was\nalso threatened by the other party with\nhis son, forbidding him from speaking\nout. This was a trace of blood that he\nhad secretly preserved many years ago,\nand even his own younger brother didn't\nknow about it all these years. Who would\nhave thought that it still couldn't be\nhidden and became a handle for others to\nuse against them? With no other option,\nLou, he could only rush back to his own\ncourtyard where at least there were\npeople protecting him. At the same time,\nwe are hoping for the words waiting for\nhelp on the note. After a frantic run,\nLu E safely brought Lugu back to the\ncourtyard. It's fortunate that they\nlived in a sujo garden, which is\ndifferent from the five courtyard layout\nof Wei Woo style. For aesthetic\npurposes, garden architecture features\nparticularly complex layouts, including\nwateride pavilions, towers, and small\nbridges spanning ponds. It's really hard\nfor people who aren't familiar with the\narea to find a spot in a short time.\nMoreover, in order to protect himself,\nLu kept a lot of bodyguards and thugs at\nhome. Shunlin and his men had already\nkilled anyone they saw, but they were\nstill delayed for quite some time. When\nShunlin and Jean Hai arrived, Lui's\ncourtyard was already surrounded by\npeople protecting him. Unlike the\nservants before, these people now held\nnot fire and water sticks, but gleaming\nsteel knives. Upon seeing Shan Llin and\nhis group, the guard charged forward\nwithout a word, swords in hand. Attack\ntogether. Kill. Kill these thieves.\nUnfortunately, numbers are useless\nagainst firearms. No matter how loudly\nthey shout, it has no effect. As they\nshouted, Shan Linn and his eight\ncompanions pulled the triggers. Da da da\nda. A series of gunshots like\nfirecrackers rang out and the guards of\nthe Lou family fell to the ground like\nwheat being harvested. Hearing screams\ncoming from outside the courtyard, Lou\nenared his eyes slightly. Just then,\neight strangers carrying strange weapons\nAlthough he didn't know what the strange\nweapon was, Lu E could sense that it was\nvery dangerous. On the other side,\nShenllin was also watching the two\nbrothers, Lu E and Lugu, but he didn't\nknow who was the head of the Lu family.\nInstead of locking his gaze on anyone,\nhe simply held up his gun and shouted,\n\"You're patriarch Lou, right? We need to\nspeak with you. Come with us.\" Upon\nhearing Shinllin's words, \"Lu did not\nrespond immediately, but instead lowered\nhis head, his mind racing with\nthoughts.\" Just then, Lugu suddenly\nstepped forward and stared at Shan. Who\nare you, sir? Daring to cause trouble\nfor the Lu family in Sujo. Don't you\nknow that the Lu family is the maternal\nfamily of the late crown princess? When\nLugu spoke, Shunlin assumed that he was\nthe head of the Lou family. Enough with\nthe nonsense. I don't care whose family\nthis is. All I know is that our young\nmaster wants to see you. Come with me,\nyoung master. Upon hearing\nShinllin&lt;unk&gt;s words, Lu E, who had\nremained silent, began to ponder the\nidentity of this young master. If it's\njust about apologizing, it's fine, even\nif he has to kneel down to apologize.\nBut does this situation seem to have\nanything to do with making amends? I've\nnever heard of having to massacre\nsomeone before apologizing. These people\nare clearly after me. If I really go\nwith them, I'm afraid I'll be left\nwishing for death. Even if he managed to\nhold back and say nothing, those people\nwouldn't believe him and still wouldn't\nlet his son go. Thinking of this, Lui's\nexpression changed. And then he looked\nat his younger brother with a deep gaze.\nThird brother, blame yourself. I told\nyou to guard the gate properly. Why\ndidn't you listen to me? I don't know if\nyou saw what was on the note, but I\nreally can't afford to gamble. Please\ndon't blame me. Let Ya handle the matter\nof continuing the Lou family line. There\nare too many things I can't say, but if\nyou don't die, Ya will be in danger.\nHaving made up his mind, a short knife\nslid from his sleeve into Lui's hand.\nBecause the large sleeves concealed the\nabnormality, Shunlin and the others\ndidn't notice anything a miss. Hero, if\nit is merely an apology, please do not\nharm our lives. We will do whatever you\nsay. In addition, I have tens of\nthousands of tales of silver notes at\nhome. If you gentlemen don't mind, I'll\nfetch the silver notes and give them to\nyou. As he spoke, Lu slowly stepped\nforward and came up behind Lugu. Tens of\nthousands of tales of silver notes are a\nhuge sum of money. Are Shinllin and his\ngroup tempted? My heart fluttered and I\nwas really, really fluttered. But\nShindlin knew very well that anything\nthe other party said at this moment was\nlikely just a delaying tactic. The key\npoint is that some money isn't yours to\nkeep. You won't live to spend it. Being\ntoo greedy will only cost you your life.\nSo after Lu E finished speaking, Shunlin\nimmediately shouted angrily. Trying to\nstall for time, huh? We just want the\nperson, not the money. After speaking,\nShunlin turned to look at the team\nmembers beside him. We cannot stay here\nany longer. Tie him up and take him away\nimmediately or things may change. At the\nsame time, Shinl gave the order. Lu er\nraised a short knife and stabbed it\nfiercely towards Lugu's back. Big\nbrother, why don't we go with him? Just\nas Lu Eie was about to succeed, Lugu\nsuddenly turned around and spoke to Lu\nE. The strike, which should have been a\nsure thing, failed to hit the vital\npoint because Lugu turn around. Big\nbrother, you you're going to kill me.\nSeeing that his own elder brother was\nabout to kill him, Lugu felt a chill run\nthrough his heart. However, Lui's next\nanswer chilled him to the bone. Third\nbrother, just die. Even if I beg you,\njust die. I'll come down and join you\nsoon. Seeing Lu E lunge at him again to\nkill him. Lugu immediately thought of\nthe note from earlier. In order to save\nhis life, he ran away as fast as he\ncould, shouting at Shinllin as he did\nso. Help me, Hero. I just saw him\nswallow a piece of paper. And I know his\nsecret. Although Lugu wasn't very\nshrewd, he wasn't stupid either. Shinlin\nand his group didn't want tens of\nthousands of tales of silver. They only\nwanted to find the head of the Lou\nfamily, which clearly indicated they had\nan ulterior motive. He didn't know if it\nwas related to the note, but he had no\nchoice but to take a gamble or he would\nreally die. Fortunately, he made the\nright bet. Bang. At the critical moment,\na gunshot rang out and Lu E fell to the\nground. Chapter 132. Song Vistine. We've\nbuilt the steam engine. Is Lui's life\nimportant? Life is not important, but\nwhat's in his head is. Therefore, Shan's\nshot was not aimed at a vital spot, but\ninstead hit Lui's thigh. Compared to a\nconstantly moving and waving arm, the\nthigh is obviously easier to hit.\nHowever, it wasn't until Shinllin got\nclose that he discovered Lu was already\ndead. The short knife he held his hand\nwas now piercing his own throat. Shunlin\nwas stunned. Jean Hai was stunned. And\neven Lu Yi's younger brother, Lu, was\nstunned. No one could understand what\nhad happened. Just moments ago, Lou E\nwas brandishing a knife, ready to kill\nsomeone, but now he was dead by his own\nhand. The key point is that the wounds\nclearly show this was not an accident.\nLu E was deliberately seeking death.\nJean Hai, keep a close eye on this man\nand absolutely do not allow him to get\ninto any more trouble. Before Jean Hai\ncould reply, Shunlin drew his dagger and\ncame over to Lu E, immediately drawing\nhis knife without saying a word. He\nhadn't forgotten what Lugu had just\nsaid, and Lu E swallowed a piece of\npaper. If Lu E hadn't died, he could\nhave found a way to beat Lu E into\nspitting out the paper. But now that the\nperson is dead, the only way to find out\nwhat was written on the paper is to\nexamine the body in person. 2 minutes\npassed and after Shan's violent\ndismantling, the note was finally found.\nUnfortunately, the writing on the note\nwas smudged and only a few words. Yong\nSong by Lu Dong Yao could be barely made\nout. Looking at the information on the\nnote, Shan Lin couldn't help but fall\ninto deep thought. Just as Shunlin\nremained silent. Jean Hai, the vice\ncaptain, also walked over. Old Shan,\nwhat's wrong? Upon hearing this, Shan\nhanded the bloodstained note to Jean\nHai. Song by Tower with a character Yong\nadded might be Song by Tower and Yong\nJoe, but it's just that the name is too\nordinary, isn't it? Before Shinllin\ncould finish speaking, Jean Hai\ninterrupted him. Shinl then nodded and\ncontinued, \"Yes, Yong Jojo is the most\nprosperous city. Even if there aren't 10\ntea houses and restaurants named Song\nby, you can still find four or five. And\nas for Dong Yao&lt;unk&gt;s actions, I can't\nfigure out what he means for the time\nbeing.\" After Shinl finished speaking,\nJean Hai frowned and pondered for a\nmoment, then came up with an idea. \"All\nright, let's blend the two groups. You\ntake seven people to YongJo and search\nall the Sombai towers. As long as we\nfind someone who is related to the name\nDong Yahweh, we should pay close\nattention to them. We can always find\nsome clues. I'll take three men with me\nto escort this guy back to the capital\nto report to the young master. The\nspecifics are up to the young master.\nAlthough it's a clumsy method, it's the\nonly option they have right now. So,\nwhen Jean Hai finished speaking, Shunlin\nimmediately nodded in agreement. All\nright, we'll do as you say. I'll send\nany news back to the capital through the\nembroidered uniform guard. After\nspeaking, Shunlin looked at the note in\nhis hand again and fell into deep\nthought. Meanwhile, far away in the\ncapital, Wayiwood just finished a fierce\nand exhilarating battle. At this moment,\nhe was in a brief period of absolute\nrationality, a state of saintthood. It's\nalmost midnight, and I suddenly remember\nthat I haven't opened the blind box that\nwas delivered today. It was the\nculmination of over 20 years of savings,\nand now it's all been released in one\nfell swoop, allowing him to ascend to\nheaven. The system should at least give\nsome kind of recognition and\ncongratulations. His gaze shifted to the\nsystems inventory, and he randomly\nselected one of the three packages\nfloating in the air. In a flash, a red\ncontainer appeared in the warehouse.\nWhen the containers appeared again, Weii\nWu was much calmer than before. There\nare priorities. Tonight is my wedding\nnight. The container is just a matter of\ntime. We can deal with it later. I'm\nvery curious about what might be inside\nthe container, but you can only see it\nwhen it's taken out. The problem is that\nhe now has a beautiful wife in his arms,\nand his time as a sage is almost over.\nWe woo, who has only recently ended his\nlife of celibacy, has already tasted the\npleasures of forbidden fruit. At this\nhour, if anyone dares to make him leave\nthis bed, he can escape the gunman and\nshoot them. I can always check the blind\nboxes I receive tomorrow, but if I don't\nuse them today, they'll be wasted\ntomorrow.\" Having made up his mind, Wayi\nWu did not hesitate at all and turned\naround to cover himself with a quilt.\nThe night passed in the blink of an eye.\nThe next day, Weii Wu really didn't want\nto get out of bed, but unfortunately,\nthis was ancient times. He stayed in bed\non the second day of his marriage. It\nwouldn't matter to him if word got out,\nbut his wife would be the subject of\ngossip. After getting up, washing up,\nand getting dressed, Weii Wu and Zu\nYuwan went to the main hall. By this\ntime, all the servants in the house were\nalready waiting there. According to\ncustom, when there is a happy occasion\nin the way household, we woo as the\nmaster of the household should give some\nreward money to the servants. It was\nalso a way to introduce the servants to\nthe mistress of the house. When the\nservants saw that the lady of the house\nwas Zu Yuan, they were all stunned. No\none expected that the person who had\nbeen a maid in the mansion for more than\nhalf a month was actually Princess Wei\nYang of the current dynasty. However,\ndespite their shock, they were mostly\nhappy. After all, Wei Wu didn't have\nmany rules in this household, and he\nwouldn't scold or beat the servants.\nWith the sudden arrival of a lady of the\nhouse, the rules of the household are\nbound to change somewhat. But it's\ndifferent if the female hostess is Zhu\nYuswan since they've already met before.\nEveryone knows Zhu Yuswan's personality\nvery well and things will continue as\nthey are now. Therefore, when Wei Wu and\nZhu Yusuan entered the main hall, the\nservants immediately greeted them\nwarmly. Wishing you, sir and madam, a\nlong and happy marriage and many\nchildren and blessings. Wishing you, sir\nand madam, a long and happy life\ntogether and much good fortune. May you,\nsir and madam, live in harmony and be\nforever united in heart. In the past,\nservants would call him young master.\nBut Wayi Wu was not married at that\ntime, and that's no longer the case.\nAccording to custom, if there are no\nelders in the family, the person who\ngets married must be addressed as\nmaster. Although he felt a bit old, Wayi\nWu was still very happy with the\nservant's blessings. With a wave of his\nhand, he took out a stack of red\nenvelopes from his pocket and casually\nhanded them to Leah, who was standing\nnext to him. The master is in a good\nmood today, so everyone can come and\nreceive a red envelope so that you can\nshare in the joy.\" Then the servants\noffered their congratulations again and\neagerly asked Leah for a red envelope.\nWeii Wu was genuinely happy today. So\nthe red envelopes contained a\nconsiderable amount of money, at least\n10 strings of cash. The largest one even\nput down 50 strings of cash, which was\nequivalent to one or two years wages for\nthem. After the servants returned to\ntheir posts, Wayi Wu looked at Zhu\nYuswan beside him. Yuswan, from now on,\nI will manage external affairs, and you\nwill manage internal affairs. You will\nbe in charge of the family's accounts\nand assets. Don't worry, my husband. We\nare husband and wife, and I will take\ngood care of the household. Wayi Wu\nnodded, about to say something more when\nthe voices of the household servants\ncame from outside the main hall. Sir,\nsomeone outside wants to see you. They\nsay they're from the Academy of\nSciences. Academy of Sciences? A hint of\ndoubt flashed in Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s eyes, but\nhe still had his servants bring the\nperson in. Not long after, Sean was seen\nwalking in with the servants, his face\nfull of excitement. As soon as he\nentered the lobby, he couldn't contain\nhis excitement. Vice, we have completed\nthe steam engine and assembled it. It's\nready for your inspection. Chapter 133,\nthe prelude to the first industrial\nrevolution in the Ming Dynasty is about\nto begin. We was wondering if something\nhad happened at the Academy of Sciences.\nUnexpectedly, San Jong brought good\nnews. The thought that the Ming dynasty\nwas about to enter the steam age and\nthat it was he who had driven it excited\nWu. Let's&lt;unk&gt; go to the Academy of\nSciences and see how your achievements\nare. After getting up, Wayi Wu was about\nto leave when he suddenly remembered Zhu\nYuwan beside him. Yusuan, I'm going to\ncheck on things at the Science and\nTechnology Institute. I'll leave things\nat home to you. Important matters are\nthe priority. Husband, you don't need to\nworry about the trivial matters at home.\nJust leave them to you. Wani Wu nodded\nand then left a mansion with Songhong\nheading to the science and technology\ninstitute. As soon as I stepped into the\nscience institute, I saw a group of\ncraftsmen gathered around a steam engine\nthe size of car. Why hasn't a vice dean\narrived yet? I really want to see how\nthis steam engine works. Yes. Yes. Using\nscorching hot steam to generate power.\nIt's amazing just to think about it. Our\ninstitute is destined to go down in\nhistory. piston, cylinder, boiler,\ntransmission rod, condenser, going back\nand forth endlessly. The ingenious\ndesign is simply a marvel of\ncraftsmanship. What's the big deal?\nDidn't the vice dean say that we should\nlearn to utilize natural phenomena? We\nmight even be able to use lightning in\nthe future. Hearing the topics the\ncraftsmen were discussing, Wayi Wu was\nvery satisfied. Their yearning for in\ncuriosity about technology proves that\nhis efforts during this period have not\nbeen in vain. Everyone, the vice has\narrived. Before Wei Wu could get close,\nSou shouted loudly. Upon hearing his\nvoice, all the craftsmen who had\ngathered around the steam engine turned\naround to greet Wei Wu. After responding\nto each question, we wu walked through\nthe crowd to the steam engine. It must\nbe said that the craftsmen of the Ming\ndynasty were truly skilled. What they\nlacked was only basic knowledge and\ninspiration. Just like now with the\nblueprints and knowledge of the\nprinciples of the steam engine, it can\nbe manufactured entirely by hand. And it\nwas exactly the same as the blueprint\nthat we woo had given them. After\nobserving for a while, we wu turned to\nlook at Jang. Have you tried turning the\nwheels manually to see if there is any\nsluggishness or other problems? Upon\nhearing this, Seong immediately replied,\n\"Don't worry, Vice President. We've\nalready tested it several times, and\nit's running without any problems. Now,\nall that's left is to test the boiler.\"\n\"All right, let's start the experiment.\nAfter the boiler is lit, remember to\nkeep people away to prevent accidents.\"\nYes. Upon receiving Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s order,\nSeaong, who had been eagerly waiting,\nimmediately went to make arrangements.\nAs Wei Wu had previously stated, this\nsteam engine would be widely deployed on\nships. Therefore, Seong and his team\nspecially crafted a propeller blade and\nconnected it to the transmission device.\nIn about 15 minutes, all the\npreparations were complete. After the\ncoal in the boiler was lit, all the\ncraftsmen followed Wayi Wu&lt;unk&gt;s\ninstructions and stayed away from the\nsteam engine. Although they really\nwanted to observe up close, their safety\nwas more important. In fact, Wayiu also\nwanted to take a closer look, but the\nsteam engine had only just been made. No\none can guarantee whether there are any\nflaws or other problems. If it's just a\nsteam leak causing burns, that's\nmanageable. But if the boiler explodes,\nthat would be a real problem. The\nscorching hot water and flying metal are\nsimply beyond the resistance of the\nmortal body. Therefore, scientific\nresearch must be conducted under safe\nconditions. As time slowly passed, the\nwater in the boiler was vaporized by the\nhigh temperature combustion of coal.\nThen, under everyone's watchful eyes,\nthe transmission rod connected to the\ncylinder slowly began to move. Clang.\nWith a simple metallic sound, the\nflywheel slowly began to rotate, driven\nby the crank and connecting rod. Driven\nby a large amount of high temperature\nsteam, the flywheel rotates faster and\nfaster. At the same time, the propeller\nconnected to the transmission device\nalso began to rotate, gradually\nincreasing in speed. Their movement also\nsignifies that the Ming dynasty\nofficially entered the steam power era.\nIt's true. It's true. We did it. It\nreally moved. It really moved. The steam\nengine, such a marvelous steam engine.\nWe built it. We built it. Our Academy of\nSciences is destined to be remembered in\nhistory. Seeing the steam engine in\noperation, all the craftsmen around were\nunable to contain their excitement. Many\nof them had tears in their eyes as if\nthey were seeing their own child being\nborn. Of all those present, Wayi Wu was\nprobably the only one whose emotions\nremained relatively calm. Although he\nwas also very happy, the steam engine\nwas built under his guidance. But he\nwas, after all, a person from later\ntimes who had seen far too many large\nmachines. The steam engine was merely a\nbeginning for him. What truly concerned\nhim was that the advent of the steam\nengine signified a revolutionary change\nin industrial capabilities. Europe was\nable to start its first industrial\nrevolution because of the steam engine.\nToday, the Ming dynasty has taken the\nlead in the industrial revolution. It is\nahead of the curve now and it will be\nahead of the curve in the future. To\nverify whether the steam engine had any\ndefects, Wayi Wu did not order it to be\nshut down for the next few hours.\nInstead, they sent people to add coal to\nthe boiler repeatedly, keeping the steam\nengine running continuously. Normally,\nthe Ming Dynasty craftsmen had no\nindustrial foundation, and this was\ntheir first time making something like\nthis. If nothing unexpected happens,\nvarious problems will arise.\nInterestingly, thanks to Weii Wu&lt;unk&gt;s\ninsistence, the steam engine ran without\nmalfunctioning until it got dark. Weii\nWu was somewhat puzzled as to why the\nfirst steam engine was so perfect. It\nwasn't until he consulted Seong that he\ncame up with a more plausible theory.\nFirst, there was the micrometer, which\nwas provided by Wei Woo as a calibration\ntool. When crafting accessories,\nartisans carefully and meticulously\npolish each small part. Secondly, with\nthe blueprints and the materials known,\nthe production process should be carried\nout strictly in accordance with the\nblueprint requirements. Even the\nmaterials used are of the highest\nquality and absolutely no flawed\nproducts are allowed. This is how the\nmiracle of perfect success on the first\nattempt was finally achieved. As\ndarkness fell, the steam engine that\nrepresented the industrial revolution\nfinally stopped running. However,\nneither way Woo nor the craftsmen wanted\nto leave. Led by wei Wu, the group\ngathered around the steam engine to\ncarefully observe and record the details\nafter it started operating. After\nrecording all the problems found, Wayi\nWu led everyone back to the classroom.\nLooking at the eager eyes of those below\nthe stage, Wayi Wu cleared his throat\nand began to speak. First of all, I\nwould like to congratulate you all. With\nyour efforts, the Ming dynasty will\nusher in a brand new era, the steam\npower era. And you are the initiators\nand founders of this era, destined to be\nremembered in history and looked up to\nby future generations. Secondly, as I\nsaid before, all participants will\nreceive a reward as long as the steam\nengine is successfully built. Just as\nway Wu was about to announce the\nrewards, Wu Chong from the construction\nteam stood up. Vice Dean, if it's a\nreward, you can't forget about our\nconstruction team. Seeing the expression\non Wu Chong's face, Weii Wu's eyes lit\nup. Is there a surprise today? Chapter\n134 Fire 2 boilers and triple expansion\nsteam engines. Regarding the rewards,\nWayi Wu had previously given them all\nsome homework. The construction team was\nresponsible for cement mixing, the\nfirearms team for gunpowder\noptimization, and the carpenters and\nblacksmiths for building steam engines.\nThe steam engine has now been\nsuccessfully tested and is running\nperfectly. Unexpectedly, the\nconstruction team also has good news.\nSeeing Wu Chong's somewhat smug\nexpression, Weii Wu also laughed, \"Well\ndone, Wu Chong. Did you manage to figure\nout the cement mix ratio without saying\na word?\" Wu Chong chuckled and\nimmediately replied, \"We must thank the\nvice dean for his guidance. Otherwise,\nwe would not have been able to create\nsuch a miraculous thing as cement.\" As\nhe spoke, Wu Chong picked up the bag\nbeside him and took out a gray stone\nbrick from it. These are the stone\nbricks made by our construction team\nusing cement. They're not only very\nhard, but also can be easily molded.\nUnfortunately, the grinding of raw\nmaterials and clinker is quite\ntroublesome, and mass production of this\ncement would require a lot of manpower.\nAs he spoke, Wu Chong looked at the\nGreystone brick in his hand and couldn't\nhelp but sigh. But at that moment, we wu\nsuddenly spoke. Wu Chong, you're blinded\nby a single leaf. There are clearly\nbetter ways. Why are you only thinking\nabout manpower? After saying this, Wayi\nWu pointed Seong and Sun Chong. The\nsteam engine has already been invented.\nWith just a little modification, it can\nperfectly replace manual grinding. As\nfor how to do it, the three of you can\ncommunicate with each other and figure\nout a way to manufacture the steam mill.\nAt this point, Wayi Wu looked at all the\ncraftsmen below the stage. Again, this\nis also what I wanted to say to you. I\nhope you can unleash your imagination\nand innovative spirit. How to modify the\nsteam engine and how to apply it to\nother places to replace human and animal\npower and improve work efficiency. As\nWayi Wu was speaking, Seong and Sun\nChong exchanged a glance and then stood\nup. Sea was the first to speak. Dean, we\nhave also thought about this point,\nnamely the application of steam engines\nto ships. As you mentioned, the current\nsteam engines are too small to power\nsuch large ships. So, we must make the\nsteam engines much larger. We envision\nbuilding a water tank that encloses the\nboiler and then connecting several or\neven a dozen pipes to the boiler. Upon\nhearing Jong's design, we was truly\nshocked. This is just a fire tube\nboiler. Connecting metal pipes from the\ntail end of the boiler and placing them\ninside the water tank increases the\ncontact area between heat energy and\nwater. The principle is the same as the\nflu of a heated Kong, a traditional\nheated bed in cold regions which\nutilizes heat energy. Steam trains are\nbasically designed in this way. Just as\nWei Wu was marveling at Seongs advanced\ndesign, Sun Chong, who was standing\nnearby, also spoke up. Dean, you\nmentioned in class that water vapor can\nabsorb heat and expand. The process of\nswitching from high pressure steam to\nlow pressure steam is the release of\nenergy which can be utilized through\nmechanical operation. So I have a\npreliminary idea which is to connect\nmultiple pipes with one part placed at\nthe very top of the water tank. As Sun\nspoke, he also took out several models,\nthe workmanship of which showed that\nthey were made by a carpenter. It's\nalmost certain that Seong was the one\nwho came up with it since he was the\nonly one who understood the structure of\nthe steam engine best. Holding the\nmodel, Sun Chan pointed at it and\nexplained it to Wei Wu. Once the boiler\nboils, the rising steam will be reheated\nby the pipes, allowing it to expand even\nmore. But this method is a bit wasteful.\nSo, we were thinking about whether we\ncould design a second cylinder to make\nuse of it. If we Woo was merely shocked\nbefore, now he was utterly astonished.\nThese two guys not only came up with the\nidea of the fire tube boiler, but they\nalso came up with the later triple\nexpansion steam engine. A triple\nexpansion steam engine, simply put adds\na cylinder drive to maximize the use of\nsteam kinetic energy. It is a power unit\nthat is actually used on large ships.\nFor example, the famous Titanic used a\nthree expansion 4 cylinder reciprocating\nsteam engine as its power source.\nAlthough this steam engine was more\nefficient and had more power, its design\nwas also more complex. Moreover, because\nthe low pressure cylinders need to be\nvery large, the steam engine itself\nwould be extremely bulky. If it were a\nEuropean ship, this thing would be out\nof the question, but the Ming dynasty\ncould give it a try. After all, China's\ndevelopment in oceangoing ship building\nwas far ahead of that of the barbarians\nin Europe. When Columbus discovered the\nAmericas, the ship he was on was only\nabout 23 m long. In China, as early as\ntheQing Dynasty, when Sufu was sent to\nsea, ships were already about 30 m long.\nNow, the Ming Dynasty's treasure ships\nare about 138 m long and 56 m wide, so\nit's entirely possible to try. Of\ncourse, this was also Weii Wu&lt;unk&gt;s\ninitial idea, but he did not expect Jang\nand Sun Chong to bring it up. You should\nknow that he didn't show the later parts\nof that book about steam power to these\ncraftsmen. The only reasonable\nexplanation for being able to draw\ninferences from one instance to another\nis that one person can apply this\nknowledge to other situations. The land\nof China is blessed with outstanding\npeople and abundant resources. The\ndescendants of Yin and Hang are the most\nexcellent human beings on Earth. While\nWeii Wu remained silent, Seong and Sun\nChong were somewhat uneasy. They were\nquite certain that their proposed idea\nwas feasible. They just didn't know if\nwe wu would approve of it. Fortunately,\nat this moment, Wayi Wu also raised his\nhead and looked at the two of them with\nadmiration in his eyes. You two are\nreally great. After he finished\nspeaking, Wayi Wu led the applause, and\nthe other craftsmen followed suit. I was\noriginally thinking that once the steam\nengine was built, I could tell you about\nthe later knowledge. I didn't expect you\nto be able to come up with this on your\nown and to be able to apply what you've\nlearned to other situations. This proves\nthat you've really put in a lot of hard\nwork and research. At the same time, I\npersonally admire and am very pleased\nwith your attitude of daring to innovate\nand boldly imagine. I hope other\ncraftsmen can learn from them and tell\nme what the mission of our institute is.\nUpon hearing we woos words, all the\ncraftsmen stood up and looked at him.\nMake bold assumptions. Verify carefully,\nadjust continuously, strive for\nexcellence, and prioritize safety.\nThat's right. Seong and Sunshan did it.\nI will ask his majesty to reward them.\nIn the future, I hope you can all do it,\ntoo. Upon hearing that way, Wu would\nrequest a reward from the emperor. The\ncraftsmen all showed expressions of\nenvy. However, a few people looked\nrather dejected, namely the three\nmembers of the firearms team. They still\nhaven't figured out what substance can\nbe added to increase the power of\ngunpowder. However, the three of them\ndid not give up. On the contrary, they\nbecame even more determined to find the\nformula. Seeing the expressions on the\nthree men's faces, Wei Wu nodded\nsecretly, but said nothing. He simply\nglanced at Seong and Sun Chong, who were\nin the midst of their excitement.\nRegarding the steam engines used in the\nships, I will ask the Ministry of Works\nto send ship building craftsmen to work\nwith you. When you design the steam\nengine structure, you must take the\ntreasure ship into account and optimize\nthe structure accordingly. All right,\nit's getting late. Let's adjourn and get\nsome rest. Knock knock. Waywood just\nfinished saying the meeting was over and\nbefore the craftsman had even left,\nthere was a knock on the classroom door.\nThen Unic Wong pushed open the door and\ncame in. Lord Chonglu, his majesty, has\nlearned of the advent of the steam\nengine and has ordered me to invite you\nto the palace for an audience. Chapter\n135. Let them see what it means for\ntechnology to change lives. Wayi Wu was\nnot surprised that Judah learned about\nthe steam engine so quickly. After all,\nhe is the president of the Academy of\nSciences. He just didn't expect old Ju\nto be in such a hurry. He had only just\nfinished his own testing when old Ju\nsent someone over. Wei Wu had originally\nplanned to talk to the firearms team,\nbut now he can only wait until tomorrow.\nAfter leaving the Academy of Sciences,\nwe followed Yun Wong into the palace and\narrived at the rear hall of function\nhall. He thought it was just old Jew\nlooking for him, but after entering the\nhall, he found that Zu Bao was also\nthere. The two most powerful people in\nthe Ming dynasty were currently bent\nover their desks, reviewing a mountain\nof memorials. They only put down what\nthey were doing when we Wu entered. And\nOld Ju waved his hand to dismiss all the\npalace servants. Before Wei Wu could\nspeak, Oldju asked directly, \"Shia Wu, I\nheard that the steam engine has been\nbuilt. What do you think? Is it as you\nimagined?\" Seeing Zhu Yuan Jang&lt;unk&gt;s\ninterest in the steam engine, Wayi Wu\nimmediately offer an explanation. \"It's\npretty much the same. Although it's just\nthe first one, it has all the functions\nit should have, and in my opinion, it's\nalready perfect. Next, we just need to\nwork on the structure and design\ndifferent mechanical structures for\ndifferent application scenarios. Upon\nhearing Wu&lt;unk&gt;s reply, Zhu Yuan Jan\nsmiled with satisfaction. In that case,\nhurry up and build that car that can\nmove on its own. We're going to give\nthem a good slap in the face. Upon\nhearing these words, we couldn't help\nbut frown. Although Zhu Yuan Jang did\nnot say it explicitly, Wayi Wu probably\nguessed that they must be those\nofficials. However, the Imperial Academy\nof Science and Technology of the Ming\nDynasty was funded and supported by\nEmperor Zu's private treasury. The\nMinistry of Revenue only provided a\npiece of land and the Ministry of Works\nprovided some personnel. Are people\nreally going to submit memorials to\ncause trouble even for something like\nthis? Are those officials just bored and\nhave nothing better to do? Just as Wei\nWu was wondering, Zhuao took out several\nmemorials and handed them over. We Wu\ntook the memorial and glanced at it,\nimmediately understanding why Xu Yuan\nJang had said those things. Although\nthese memorials did not name Wei Wu\nspecifically, they all criticized the\nAcademy of Science and Technology. Some\nsay that the Academy of Sciences was\nasking the iron works for help with\nsmelting every day which disrupted the\nnormal operation of the iron foundry.\nThis severely impacted iron production.\nAnd eventually the controversy escalated\nto the point of being a national\ndisaster. When we woo saw this memorial,\nhe wish he could find this guy right\naway and start cursing him. The Academy\nof Sciences does ask the foundry for\nhelp, but each time they make the molds\nand materials themselves. The iron\nproduction from just one furnace at the\nfoundry is more than enough to meet the\nneeds of the Academy of Sciences. The\nentire iron foundry has a total of 18\niron smelting furnaces, six steel making\nfurnaces, and several casting furnaces.\nOf the 18 iron smelting furnaces, only\n12 are used in rotation throughout the\nyear for iron smelting. Unless war\nbreaks out or the Imperial Court\nurgently needs iron, all the furnaces\nwill be put into operation. Moreover,\nwhen the furnace was being opened for\niron making, the Academy of Sciences did\nnot use any people from the foundry. It\nwas all Sun Chong who led the operation.\nSo, here's the problem. How can we use\nidle furnaces to smelt iron without\nneeding to send people from the iron\nfoundry? How did it escalate to the\npoint of harming the country and its\npeople? What country is it harming and\nwhat people are harming? In addition,\nthere were even more outrageous\nofficials who made wildly absurd\nstatements in their memorials. They say\nthat people at the Academy of Sciences\nspend their days researching strange and\ningenious techniques, advocating\nunhealthy trends, and doing nothing to\nbenefit the country. If everyone does\nthis, it will inevitably lead to\ndisastrous consequences in the long run.\nI hope the emperor will abolish and shut\nit down as a warning to others. The key\nissue is that the officials memorial\nneither explained how it led to the\nincident nor clarified the negative\nconsequences. Basically, the message is\nthat the Science and Technology\nInstitute is wrong. Something bad is\nbound to happen and should be shut down\nas soon as possible to prevent it from\nharming the country. To be honest, Wayi\nWoo had long anticipated that there\nwould be obstacles to technological\ndevelopment. But at least there should\nbe some reason to it. These corrupt\nofficials don't even listen to reason.\nThey oppose for the sake of opposing.\nAre they human beings or pests? Just as\nwayu was looking at the memorial in\nsilence. Old Zu spoke up again. Shia Wu.\nActually, similar memorials come in\nevery day, but we've been suppressing\nthem and not paying attention to them.\nThese people can't cause any trouble. If\nthey really piss us off, we could just\norder them to be killed without any\nproblem. But we'd rather let the facts\nspeak for themselves rather than\nresorting to violence. We'd rather slap\nthose short-sighted people in the face.\nUpon hearing Zhu Yuan Jang&lt;unk&gt;s voice,\nWei Wu finally came to his senses. After\na moment's hesitation and some internal\nthought, he finally spoke. Uncle Zu,\nactually, wait a minute. What did you\ncall me again? Why didn't you even call\nme father-in-law after marrying my\ndaughter? Um, father-in-law, I'm just\nused to calling you that. Besides,\ncalling you uncle Zu feels more\nfriendly. As he spoke, Wayi Wu quickly\nturned to look at Zu Bao beside him.\nBrother, don't you think that makes\nsense? Calling him Uncle Zu at least\nshows that he hasn't forgotten his\noriginal intention. Zu Bao chuckled\ninwardly upon hearing this. In the past,\nWei Wu always called him brother Zhu,\nwhich lacked a certain intimacy. But\nnow, Wei Wu has dropped his surname and\ndirectly calls him elder brother, which\nshows that their relationship has\nprogressed further. Anyway, his father\nwouldn't care about a form of address,\nso he simply nodded and said in support,\n\"That's right, that's the truth. It\ndoesn't matter what we call it. We're\nall family anyway.\" After Zhu Bao\nfinished speaking, Zhu Yuan Jang was\nfurious and glared at him. \"All right,\nall right, you two brats are in cahoots.\nCall me whatever you want. Let's get\ndown to business.\" Zuyu and Jang&lt;unk&gt;s\nanswer made Wei Wu and Zu Bao laugh.\nHowever, after laughing, Wei Wu still\ngot down to business. Uncle Zu, there\nare actually many ways to shut these\npeople up with a steam engine. It\ndoesn't necessarily have to be a moving\nvehicle. The main problem is that it\ntakes time to build those kinds of cars\nand they also need to be paired with\nrailway tracks. So, it's difficult to do\nit in a short period of time. In\ncontrast, using steam engines on ships\nis much more effective. With just a few\nmodifications, the magic of a steam\nengine can be demonstrated. Wayiwi Wu's\nwords may sound a bit far-fetched, but\nin reality, they are simpler than\nbuilding a locomotive. All the ships in\nthe Ming Dynasty were wooden boats,\nwhich were easy to modify, at least\neasier than manufacturer. The steam\nengine has now been manufactured and is\nworking perfectly. All you need is a\nsmall boat, like the painted boats,\nmored along the banks of the Chinuai\nRiver. Modify the stern area and make a\npropeller to connect the long rod to the\nsteam engine. When a steam engine starts\noperating, it drives the propeller to\nrotate and generate thrust and a ship\nwill naturally move. Since it's just\nabout demonstrating the powerful\ncapabilities of the steam engine, it\ndoesn't need to be too sophisticated. Of\ncourse, if it were just a slap in the\nface like that, we woo felt it wasn't\nenough. Or rather, it didn't hurt hard\nenough. These people claimed that their\nresearch institute is a scourge to the\ncountry and its people. He then prepared\nto reveal other things as well to show\nthese people how they could bring\ndisaster to the country and its people.\nThinking of this, Wayiu immediately\nlooked up at Ju Yuan Jean. Uncle Zu,\nsince we're going to demonstrate, let's\ntake this opportunity to let everyone\nsee the power of technology. Besides the\nsteam engine, I also plan to bring out\nsome other things to show them what it\nmeans for technology to change lives.\nChapter 136. Ultimately, the Ming\ndynasty perished due to its finances. At\nthis point, Wayi Wu suddenly had an\nidea. Uncle Zu, I've got an idea. Since\nwe're showcasing the research results of\nthe Academy of Sciences anyway, why not\nexpand its influence? At that time, in\naddition to those officials, we will\nalso invite some wealthy businessmen and\nordinary people to let more people see\nthe power of technology. As soon as we\nWu finished speaking, Zhu Yuan Jang\nasked with a puzzled look. Shiao Wu, why\ninvite wealthy merchants and ordinary\npeople in addition to officials. Upon\ncontinued, \"We called on the people so\nthat they could see the wonders of\ntechnology and spread what they saw. As\nI told you before, the development of\nscience and technology requires talent,\nwhich is inseparable from the hard work\nof generations. In the pursuit of talent\nis inseparable from education.\nNumerology and divination should be made\na major discipline. Have you started on\nthis point, Uncle Zu? Zhu Yuan Jang\nsmiled slightly but did not speak.\nInstead, Zhu Bao, who is standing to the\nside, spoke up. My father and I have\nalready decided on this. We will include\ndivination and numerology in the\nimperial examinations. If the higher-ups\nfollow suit, the lower level officials\nwill naturally follow suit. Upon hearing\nZu Bao's reply, Wayi Wu couldn't help\nbut sigh, realizing that having power\ntruly made things easier. If you set any\nrule, scholars will naturally follow it,\nunless they don't want to take the\nimperial examinations. Now that the\neducation issue had been resolved, we\nwoo spoke up again. In addition to\neducation, we must also inspire the\ncuriosity of ordinary people about\nscience. Let them see the power of\ntechnology and be willing to devote\nthemselves to it. It's just a bit\ntroublesome to do this since there are\nfar fewer people with passion than those\nwho pursue fame and fortune. Last time,\nMr. Zu asked me to list the levels and\npositions of the Academy of Sciences and\nsubmit them to you for review and\napproval. Actually, also have some\nideas. At this point, Wayi Wu paused for\na moment before continuing. I suggest\nthat the levels of the Academy of\nSciences be divided into researchers and\nmissians with researchers ranging from\nlevel one to level five and in three\nlevels. Everyone starts at level one and\nadvances in rank based on their\ncontributions to individual research\nwhile also receiving improved\ncompensation. Only researchers with\nsignificant achievements are eligible\nfor the honor of being awarded a noble\ntitle when they are nominated for\nacademic. Wayiu had also considered the\nissue of titles of nobility, noting that\nany dynasty would strictly control them.\nSo when the topic came up, he\nimmediately added a comment. Regarding\nthe issue of periage, my suggestion is\nto only grant some stipend and status\nwithout allowing participation in court\npolitics or hereditary succession. Of\ncourse, Uncle Zu, you're the director of\nthe Imperial Academy of Science and\nTechnology of the Ming Dynasty. Whether\nor not you're granted a title is up to\nyou. I am just making a suggestion.\nWhile Weii Wu was speaking, Zhu Yuan\nJang remained silent. He knew very well\nthat Wayi Wu was right. Fame and fortune\nwere always the things people were most\neager to pursue. So after Wei Wu\nfinished speaking, he also gave his own\ndecision. If they have achieved\nsignificant results that benefit the\ncountry and its people, it would be\nappropriate to grant them titles. We\nwill carefully consider the specifics.\nNow that you've explained why you\ninvited ordinary people, shouldn't you\nexplain why you invited even wealthy\nmerchants? Businessmen are\nprofit-driven. They'll do anything to\nmake money. Do these people also\ncontribute to the development of\ntechnology? Upon hearing Zhu Yuan\nJang&lt;unk&gt;s words, Wu immediately\ngrinned. Of course, it's related. Uncle\nZu, haven't you always been worried\nabout money? We invited them here\nprecisely because of money. In fact,\napart from the more sensitive ones, the\nresearch results of the Academy of\nSciences can be completely handed over\nto them for operation. However, this\nmatter is a bit troublesome. So, let's\ntalk about it later. For now, let's\ncontinue with the matter of being\nslapped in the face. Upon hearing Wei Wu\nmention money, Zhu Yuan Jang immediately\nperked up, but then Weii Wu changed his\nmind and stopped talking, which was\nunbearable for Zhu Yuan Jang. Xiao Wu,\nyou can handle the slapping of faces. We\ntrust your abilities. Let's talk about\nthe money first. The reason why Weii Wu\ndidn't mention money was mainly because\nit involved too much and would be\ndifficult to implement. However, since\nZu Yuan Jang had already asked, he had\nno reason to hide anything and simply\ntold him directly. Uncle Zu, don't you\nthink our Ming dynasty's commercial\ntaxes are too low? 1/30th of the tax is\npractically no tax at all. It is\nimportant to understand that commercial\ntaxes are the cornerstone of national\ntax revenue and finance and a vigorous\ndevelopment of commerce is an important\nsource of stable national income. In the\npast, when we Wu spoke, Zhu Yuan Jang\nlistened more and spoke less and rarely\nrefuted him. But this time, after\nlistening to Wayi Wu&lt;unk&gt;s words, he\nimmediately refuted them. Xiao Wu, we\nknow that merchants are rich. Everyone\nin the world knows that merchants make\nmoney. That's why we suppress commercial\ndevelopment. After all, merchants bring\nruin to the country. If everyone goes\ninto business just to make money, who\nwill cultivate the fertile fields of the\nworld? Upon hearing this, Wayi Wu\ncouldn't help but shake his head and\nsigh deeply. Uncle Zu, do you remember\nwhat I said before about how we couldn't\ncollect taxes at the end of the Ming\ndynasty? Fertile land has been seized\nand people have become unregistered. The\nland of this world needs people to\ncultivate it, but those who need have no\nland to cultivate. The common people\nhave no land, and the gentry cannot\ncollect taxes. Jang Nin is extremely\nwealthy. A middle-class family in Jang\nNin can easily come up with a million\ntales of silver. At this point, Wayi Wu\nstared intently at Juu Yuan Jang. You\nsay that merchants bring disaster to the\ncountry, but the biggest merchants in\nthe world are the gentry in Jangan and\nthey're the happiest when commercial\ntaxes are low. They keep saying that\nincreasing commercial taxes is competing\nwith the people for profit and that\ncollecting taxes from the gentry is\nadding burdens to the people, but can\nthey really be considered the people?\nDeveloping commerce at the very least\nprovides a way for people to support\nthemselves when they have no land to\ncultivate. Right? If it were during the\nlate Ming dynasty when a national\ntreasury had commercial taxes to support\nit, Emperor Chongjin would not have been\nso poor that he could not even pay the\nmilitary salaries. Ultimately, our great\nMing dynasty perished because of its\nfinances. It died of poverty. After\nlistening to Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s remarks, Zhu\nYuan Jang did not refute them this time,\nbut lowered his head and remained\nsilent. At this moment, Wei Wu spoke\nagain. Uncle Zu, once the sea ban is\nlifted, customs duties and commercial\ntaxes will be important sources of\nrevenue. We're just preparing for this\nnow. Moreover, once we wipe out the\nJapanese pirates and bring back those\ngold and silver mines, we will need\ncommercial development. If you have too\nmuch money, it needs to circulate.\nOtherwise, it will not only be of no\nbenefit, but it will also cause economic\ncollapse, which is a losing proposition.\nWhat wayu actually wanted to talk about\nwas inflation but he didn't really\nunderstand it either. Moreover, the\nprimary objective now is to resolve the\nissue of commercial taxes. As for the\nissue of inflation, we can bring up the\nbasic theories later when there is an\nopportunity and let the officials in the\nMinistry of Revenue study them. After\nlistening to Weii Wu&lt;unk&gt;s explanation,\nZhu Yuan Jang understood the importance\nof commercial taxes, but he was just\nbeing stubborn for the time being. At\nthat moment, we woo delivered a fatal\nblow. Although the Song Dynasty was\nweak, it was the wealthiest dynasty in\nhistory. And the reason for this was\nthat the Song Dynasty valued commerce.\nUncle Zu, what we're doing now is laying\na solid foundation for his highness, the\ncrown prince, and building the Ming\ndynasty into the strongest nation in\nhistory. I believe that with your\ntalent, you will be able to excel in\nboth military and economic affairs in\nthe future. Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s words hit Zu\nYuan Jang right where it hurt. At this\nmoment, no more nitpicking matters\nmattered. He turned a look at Zu Bao.\nBower, I'm entrusting you with handling\nthe commercial tax and the land tax\nreform. Consider it a test for you.\nChapter 137. Not contributing a single\npenny yet still wanting to repair the\nroad. Zu Bao didn't expect old Jews\nchange to happen so quickly. However, he\nhad already studied the matter of\nmerging the pole tax into the land tax\nand had a plan for how to implement it.\nAs for commercial taxes, that's even\nsimpler. There are examples from every\ndynasty that we can learn from. The most\ncritical difficulty is that both of\nthese matters affect the interests of\nthe gentry who are certainly not happy\nabout it. But this meant nothing to\nZubial. He has a father who wields a\nbutcher's knife who would dare risk\nbeing beheaded to jump out and cause\ntrouble. All that's needed is for dad to\nplay the bad cop and for him to step up\nand play the good cop. Just as Zu Bao\nwas deep in thought, he suddenly heard\nWei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s voice again. The money\ncollected from commercial taxes all goes\nto the national treasury. Now, let's\ntalk about the money you can earn. Uncle\nZu.\nUpon hearing Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s words, Zu Yuan\nJang and Zu Bao both turned to look at\nhim. They all thought that the solution\nto the problem of money that Xiao Chow\nmentioned was to collect commercial\ntaxes. But now it seems they were all\nwrong. Just as the two were wondering,\nWeii Wu spoke up again. Uncle Zu,\nbesides the steam engine, the Academy of\nSciences has also developed a building\nmaterial called cement. Did you know\nthat? Upon hearing Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s\nquestion, Zhu Yuan Jang slowly nodded.\nIn fact, Zhu Yuan Jang had always been\npaying attention to matters concerning\nthe Academy of Sciences. He knew about\ncement, but he didn't take it seriously.\nHowever, now that Way Wu had brought it\nup, he realized that he had probably\nunderestimated this thing. Just then,\nWayi Wu spoke again. Uncle Zu, I heard\nthat when building the city wall, in\naddition to lime and soil, a substance\ncalled 3in-1 soil is also added. This\nkind of soil is made from glutenous\nrice, egg white, and animal blood, and\nit's used to bind stone bricks. Once it\nsolidifies, it's incredibly hard, right?\nUpon hearing this, Zhu Yuan Jang nodded\nand said, \"That's right.\" Wayi Wu smiled\nslightly and continued. Cement is\nactually a kind of adhesive used in\nconstruction. Of course, it can also be\nused alone to build bridges and pave\nroads. But if you mix sand and gravel\nwith water, it becomes concrete, which\nis just as good as rammed earth and\ncheaper. 3in-1 soil requires a lot of\nglutenous rice and eggs, while cement\nonly requires clay, limestone, and\ngypsum to be fired. After listening to\nWei Woos explanation, Zhu Yuan Jang\nfinally understood that cement was\nindeed a good thing. You should know\nthat glutenous rice and eggs are things\nthat ordinary people may not be able to\nafford. You can imagine how much demand\nthere was for these things to build city\nwalls. This thing called cement not only\nhas the same effect, but its raw\nmaterials can be dug out from the\nground. It could be described as both\ncheap and practical. Zhu Yuan Jang just\nhadn't yet figured out how Chow Chow\ncould use this to make money.\nFortunately, Weii Wu then provided the\nanswer. The reason I invited the wealthy\nbusinessmen here this time is to\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of cement\nand let them see it with their business\nacumen. They can easily see the business\nopportunities brought by cement and\nwe'll definitely try to find out the\nformula. At that time we just need to\nbring them over in the name of the\nacademy of sciences. We will provide the\ntechnology and they will provide the\nmoney to jointly establish a cement\nplant. The academy of sciences belongs\nto the emperor. The money it earns\nnaturally goes into the imperial\ntreasury and won't be criticized.\nAlthough Weii Wu&lt;unk&gt;s words were\nreasonable and wellfounded, Zhu Yuan\nJang still had doubts. Shiao Wu, it's\njust opening a cement factory. How much\nmoney can you make? It seems like there\naren't many places in the private sector\nthat need it. Upon hearing Zhu Yuan\nJ&lt;unk&gt;s question, Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s lips\ncurled into a smile and he continued,\n\"Of course, the common people don't have\nit. And even if they did, the demand\nwouldn't be great. But the Imperial\nCourt does. As the saying goes, if you\nwant to get rich, build roads first. All\nthat's needed is for the Imperial Court\nto issue an edict to build a road from\none place to another and to require that\nit be constructed using cement. This\nroute can connect two bustling locations\nsuch as the capital city to Kiong where\nthere is no waterway and the only option\nis to travel by land. At this point, Wei\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s throat was dry, so he picked up\nthe water glass on the table and drank\nit all in one gulp. Just as he was about\nto continue speaking, Zhu Yuan Jang\ninterrupted him. Xiao Wu, you may not be\nvery familiar with the National\nTreasury. Now that the southwest is at\nwar, the national treasury doesn't have\nmuch money left. Moreover, the journey\nfrom the capital to Kiong is over a\nthousand miles long. Even without war,\nthe national treasury cannot support\nsuch an expenditure. Zhu Yuan J&lt;unk&gt;s\nconcerns were not unfounded. But we wu\nhad also considered this point. Uncle Zu\nwho says that road construction has to\nbe funded by the imperial court. We can\nput out a tinder and let private\nmerchants pay for the road construction.\nAfter Wei Wu finished speaking, Zhu Yuan\nJean looked at him with a puzzled\nexpression. Tendering? What is\ntendering? Bidding is a market behavior.\nSimply put, the imperial court provides\na profitable project and lets others\ncontract it. But road construction costs\nmoney. So how can we make money from it?\nYou can't make money by building roads,\nbut once the roads are built, you can\nmake money from them. Seeing that Zhu\nYuan Jang still looked puzzled, we wu\ncontinued to explain. Uncle Zu, how many\ndays do you think it would take for a\ncaravan to travel from the capital to\nKiong? The caravan is large and the\ngoods are heavy, so will probably take\nat least 15 days and even longer if\nthere is heavy rain. If they could\ntravel this route in about 5 days\nwithout fear of wind and rain, would the\ncaravan choose to take this route? As\nsoon as we Wu finished speaking, Zhu\nYuan Jang immediately gave his answer.\nIf it can save time, I will definitely\nchoose this route. After Zhu Yuan Jang\nfinished speaking, Weii Wu spoke again.\nRoads built with concrete are not only\nsmooth and hard, but also won't get\nmuddy when it rains, saving a lot of\ntime. Therefore, even if the caravan has\nto spend some money, it will definitely\nchoose this time-saving route. At this\npoint, Weii Wu explained the highway\ntoll collection method used in later\ngenerations. Zhu Yu and Jangs eyes lit\nup immediately after hearing this. And\nthen Wei Wu continued, \"Simply put this\nroad out for tender, and businessmen can\nchoose how long to build based on their\nfinancial resources. then set a time\nlimit 10 or 20 years and all the fees\ncollected for this section of the road\nwill belong to them. Of course, they're\nalso responsible for the road\nmaintenance. Once the road reaches the\nend of its service life, it will be\nnationalized. In addition, they could be\nallowed to build rest stations along the\nroadside to provide supplies and safe\nplaces for traveling merchants to rest.\nThe Imperial Corps can build a road\nwithout spending a single penny. And it\ncan also provide a stable sales channel\nfor cement. The more way Wu spoke, the\nbrighter Xi Yuan Jangs eyes became, and\nhe couldn't wait to put it into action\nimmediately. Even Zu Bao, who was\nstanding to the side, was tempted and\neven took the initiative to interject\nwith a comment. Once the first road is\ncompleted, businessmen will see the\nbusiness opportunities and will be eager\nto participate in the bidding for the\nnext road construction project. At that\ntime, we can even ask them to put up\nmoney first to obtain the qualification\nto bid and then they can participate in\nthe bidding project. If this cycle\ncontinues, one day we'll be able to pave\nthe entire Ming dynasty with smooth\ncement roads. Right. Chapter 138. Love\nthe people. Abuse the people. What is\nthe meaning of the people in old Jews\nheart? Wayiu was not at all surprised\nthat Zhu Bao could think of these\nthings. He is after all the most stable\ncrown prince in history. So there is no\nquestion about his abilities. So after\nZu Bao finished speaking, Wayi Wu\nimmediately nodded in response. That's\nright. Cement roads are beneficial for\npeople's travel and merchants\ntransportation of goods. In the future,\nonce they are paved, it will be even\nfaster for troops to transport supplies.\nAnd it's not just about building roads.\nSimilar methods can be used to build\ncity walls or other structures in the\nfuture. We can also set a construction\nperiod. If the merchants want the road\nto be completed within the time limit,\nthey will have to spend money to hire\npeople. In this way, not only can the\nsuffering of the people from Corv labor\nbe reduced, but the people can also earn\nsome money to make a living during the\noffse. The ancient Corv system was\nutterly inhumane and unreasonable. The\nso-called Corv labor was the forced\nlabor imposed by the imperial court\nwhich designated the common people to\nwork for free. Simply put, it means that\nthe rulers forced ordinary people to do\nhard labor, leaving them with no money\nand forcing them to provide their own\nfood and drink. Since we've come this\nfar, Wayi Wu felt it necessary to add\none more point. Uncle Zu Han Fezy said,\n\"If there are few Corv labors, the\npeople will be at peace. If the people\nare at peace, there will be no powerful\nofficials below. If there is no powerful\nofficials below, power and authority\nwill be destroyed. If power and\nauthority are destroyed, virtue will\nprevail above. Our great Ming dynasty is\nstill in its early stages, and Corv\nlabor is unavoidable. We can only try to\nreduce the suffering of the people as\nmuch as possible. When commercial and\ncustoms taxes develop in the future, the\nMing dynasty will be wealthy and its\ntreasury will be full. Implementing\nlabor service in lie of Corv labor will\nbe the best policy. At this point, we wu\nraised his head to look at Zhu Yuan Jang\nonly to find his eyes filled with\nsemnity and deep thought. He understood\nthat his words had indeed struck accord\nwith Zhu Yuan Jang. As a Ming Dynasty\nenthusiast, Wayi Wu had actually done\nhis research on Zhu Yuan Jangs affairs.\nSome say that Zhu Yuan Jang never\nbelieved in equality and also disliked\nMincius's ideas that the people were\nmore important than the ruler. The\nproblem is to address this issue, we\nmust first define what exactly\nconstitutes the people. Zhu Yuan Jang\nrose from the bottom and he had his own\nset of standards for the people. In this\nera, farmers, peasants, and those at the\nbottom of society who were illiterate\nshould be called common people rather\nthan people. The people in his heart\nwere actually those nominally the\npeople. But in reality, they were the\nelite class because only they can read\nand write and only they know how to\nconstantly bring up the people. They can\nuse it immediately whenever needed, such\nas when collecting commercial taxes,\nwhich they would say is competing with\nthe people for profit. When taxes were\ncollected from the gentry, they dared to\nsecretly send their servants to cause\ntrouble and even kill court officials\nwho came to collect taxes. Then I must\nadd that it was the emperor's\nimplementation of wicked laws that\nincited popular uprisings and caused\nwidespread resentment. People with power\nand influenced air to say that the court\nis oppressive and abusive when their\nfamily members commit crimes and are\narrested. Why do so many people in later\ngenerations criticize Zhu Yuan Jang,\nsaying he was cruel and abusive towards\nthe people, an executioner, and a\ntyrant? Because Zhu Yuan Jang was indeed\nunkind to merchants, gentry, officials,\nand nobles. These people can say it out\nloud and write it down. So naturally,\nthey won't have anything nice to say\nabout him. But those who truly benefited\nand were cared for could not write it\ndown, and no one would care even if they\ndid. In Juyu and Jang&lt;unk&gt;s mind, the\npoor and lowly were also human beings,\nand he just wanted them to survive.\nHaving experienced hunger himself, he\nalso wanted to ensure that the people\nhad enough to eat, and ideally that\ntaxes and levies were reduced so that\nthey could live like human beings.\nHowever, some things cannot be changed\nby one person alone. They require\nmethods and approaches. Zhu Yuan Jang\nwas capable, but his humble origins\nlimited his thinking. Yet he still\nwanted to accomplish things. If no\nbetter way can be found, then the only\noption is to kill. To kill until\neveryone is afraid of him. What Way Wu\nis saying now is exactly what he has\nalways wanted to do. As long as\ncommercial taxes and customs duties can\nreplenish the national treasury and do\nnot affect the country's normal\ndevelopment. If money is used to replace\nlabor service, then ordinary people can\nindeed live a more comfortable life. So\nafter a brief silence, Zhu Yuan Jang\nalso offered a solution. Xiao Wu, \"Is\nthat cement you mentioned really as\neffective as mortar and cement?\" Weii Wu\nnodded and said affirmatively, \"Yes, it\nreally exists.\" Upon hearing this, Zhu\nYuan Jang&lt;unk&gt;s eyes flashed with a\nsharp light, and then he spoke, \"All\nright, since that's the case, let's step\nup our efforts and get the cement\nnoticed by wealthy businessmen as soon\nas possible.\" The city walls of the\ncapital are currently under\nconstruction. So, let's use these walls\nas a bidding project to attract wealthy\nbusinessmen. Xiao Wu, could you come up\nwith a way to get those wealthy\nmerchants to fund the construction of\nthe city walls just like you did with\nthe roads? Zhu Yuan Jang&lt;unk&gt;s words put\nway in a difficult position. City walls\nare related to the city's defense and\nsecurity, but they don't seem to have\nmuch commercial value. Who would be\nwilling to spend money on them? Uncle\nZu, I really can't think of a way to\nmake money from the city wall, but it\ncan help reduce costs. Take out the\nmoney for building the city wall and\nthen put forward the requirements and\nacceptance standards and let those\nwealthy merchants bid for it themselves.\nAs long as the quality and quantity are\nguaranteed, the project will be assigned\nto whoever offers the highest efficiency\nand lowest cost. If you still think\nthat's not enough, then you can only\noffer a title of nobility. I bet someone\nwould even pay out of pocket to build\nthe city wall. In fact, we will only\nbrought up the matter of the title\nbecause he had no other choice. After\nall, the social hierarchy was scholars,\nfarmers, artisans, and merchants.\nHistorically, except for a few\ndynasties, most merchants had a very low\nsocial status. For these merchants,\nmoney is something they can earn on\ntheir own, but titles are something they\ncan never even touch. The ability to\nelevate one's social status is quite\nattractive to wealthy businessmen. After\nhearing Wu&lt;unk&gt;s words, Zhu Yuan Jang\nwas somewhat tempted. The title of\nnobility is nothing more than a matter\nof his word. If this can help promote\ncement and pave the way for future road\nconstruction, then it would be\nworthwhile. Once the road construction\nplan forms a virtuous cycle, a mere\ntitle will be nothing. With this in\nmind, Zhu Yuan Jang no longer hesitated.\nOkay, we&lt;unk&gt;ll do it your way. Shiao\nWu, who do you think would be the best\nperson to handle this? The best\ncandidate is, of course, the eldest\nbrother, but the eldest brother has too\nheavy a burden on his shoulders, and\noverwork is likely to harm his health.\nAt this point, we wu pondered for a\nmoment and then suggested a candidate.\nWhy don't we entrust this matter to the\nprince of Yan? As a prince in charge of\nthe army, he will surely take the matter\nof city defense seriously. Zhu Yuan Jang\nthought it made sense and immediately\ndecided on the candidate. All right, let\nthe fourth brother handle this matter.\nBowerer, you informed the fourth brother\nand we&lt;unk&gt;ll see how capable he is.\nSeeing Zhu Bao nod, Zhu Yuan Jang looked\nat Wayi Wu again. Shia Wu, the cement\nmatter is important, but we also need to\nhurry up with the matter of slapping the\nofficials in the face. How long will it\ntake you here? Wayi Wu pondered for a\nmoment and then gave his answer. 7 days\na week is fine. All right, in 7 days\nyou'll show us what's what and then give\nthem a good slap in the face. Chapter\n139. The system is so generous it even\ndelivered the machine tool. It was late\nat night when I returned home from the\npalace. However, we would gotten used to\nit since he and Lau always chatted for\nquite a while. Back home, we was about\nto go to his room to rest when he\nsuddenly remembered that he hadn't\nopened the package for today. Moreover,\nI've been busy since this morning, and I\nhaven't even opened the container from\nyesterday.\" So, he paused and turned to\ncome to the garden. After confirming\nthat no one was around, he had a sudden\nthought, and with a clang, the red\ncontainer was taken out. He was\ninitially quite excited, wondering what\nwould be inside the container. When I\nopened the box, I was even more excited.\nmachine tools. This container is\nactually filled with machine tools.\nAlthough they weren't large CNC machine\ntools, they were just a few\nold-fashioned hand operated turning and\nmilling machines from the 1970s.\nHowever, there's also a decent boring\nmachine in the container. Having this\nthing would be a godsend for steam\nengines. By boring the inside of the\nworkpiece, the resulting cylinder will\nbe completely free of defects. Heaven is\non our side. Now those ministers faces\nwon't just be swollen from being\nslapped. They'll be ripped open and\nbleeding. I originally wanted the\ncraftsman to handcraft a flint lock\nmusket, but now it's much simpler. At\nthis moment, Wayi Wu even regretted not\nopening the container for inspection\nlast night. If he had known earlier that\nit contained these treasures, he would\nhave taken fewer shots and checked it\nsooner. The key issue is that the system\nhas been stingy lately and it hasn't\noffered many good features. Wayi Wu\nnever expected the system to be so\ngenerous this time, sending him an\nindustrial marvel. To be honest, at that\nmoment, he wished he could go straight\nto the science institute without even\ngoing back to his room, call everyone\nup, and then do everything he wants to\ndo. But then I thought, it seems a bit\ntoo much to leave my beautiful wife\nalone in the room on the second day of\nour marriage. After thinking for a\nmoment, Wayi Wu packed up the container\nand turned to walk quickly toward his\nhouse. He originally thought Zhu Yushuan\nwas already asleep since it was already\nquite late. Upon entering the gate, they\ndiscovered that Zhu Yushuan and Ching\nXiao were sitting at the coffee table\nlooking at something. Upon seeing Weii\nWu return, the two immediately stood up.\nMy husband, you're back. Master, you're\nback. Yes, I'm back. It was a really\ntiring day. I was busy until now before\nI got back. Wayu nodded quickly walked\nup to Zhu Yuwan and kissed her forehead.\nThen he collapsed onto the sofa, letting\nout a groan of pleasure the moment his\nbody sank into it. Awesome. After\nstretching vigorously, Weii Wu turned to\nlook at Juyusan. By the way, what are\nyou guys looking at? Seeing that Wu\nlooked tired, Juwan slowly walked behind\nthe sofa and placed her hands on his\nshoulders. They're checking the\nhousehold accounts. the ledger. Oh,\nright. You're in charge of the household\naccounts. Have you figured out how much\nmoney we have now? Zu Yushwa nodded and\nsaid, \"The calculation is complete.\n20,000 tales of gold, 150,000 tales of\nsilver, and 189,760\nstrings of paper money. 140 hectares of\nfertile land for shops in the capital,\ntwo restaurants, one tea house, and one\nrestaurant called Behigh Chaoslu.\nFurthermore, the gold, silver, jewelry,\nsilk, gauze, and brocade remained\nuntouched. And there was also Zhuan\nlisted out all of her family's assets to\nWei Wu. After she finished speaking, we\nwu laughed. Of all the wealth in our\nfamily, I've earned half of it, and the\nrest will all be your dowy. This is like\ngetting rich overnight by marrying a\nwife. Upon hearing this, Zhu Yushwan\ncovered her mouth and chuckled. My\nhusband, we are husband and wife. We are\none. Why should we distinguish between\neach other? This money is not mine or\nyours. It belongs to our family. Hey, my\nwife is such a virtuous and kind woman.\nAs they spoke, we wu grabbed Zhu\nYusuan's hand, pulled her around the\nsofa, and then drew her into his arms.\nSeeing Wu and Zhu Yusuan so\naffectionate, Ching Xiao wisely left\nquietly. At this moment, Wayi Woo, who\nwas holding Zuyu Schwan finally spoke,\n\"My wife, today I would like to have an\nin-depth discussion with you about\nsoftware hardening engineering and water\nconservancy dredging engineering.\"\nSoftware engineering. Water conserancy\ndredging engineering. Husband, I don't\nunderstand. No, believe me, you know\nwhat I mean. As he spoke, Wayi Wu\nflicked his wrist and slipped a pair of\nclassic black stockings with lettering\nfrom a certain aristocratic family into\nhis hand. Go back to your room first and\nput this on. It will greatly enhance our\nresearch enthusiasm. Zhu Yushuan held\nthe black stockings with a puzzled look,\nbut didn't say anything and turned to go\ninto the room. After Zhu Yusuan left,\nWayi Wu switched the view to the system\nwarehouse. I just checked yesterday's\nshipping container and I haven't opened\ntoday's blind boxes yet. Looking at the\nthree packages suspended in the air in\nthe system space. This time he was too\nlazy to choose and directly selected the\none on the left. Then the screen flashed\nand a rectangular box appeared in front\nof us. The box is small, only slightly\nlarger than a cigarette pack. The\npackaging is red with white lettering\nand has a plastic film on the outside.\nOkamoto 0 001. The moment We Woo saw the\nbox, he immediately recognized what it\nwas. Take the box out of the warehouse\nand hold it in your hand. After\npondering for a moment and thinking of\nthe maid on night duty, Wei Wu turned\nand shouted towards the door. \"Nata,\nKain, here you are, young master.\" No\nsooner had Wei Wu finished shouting than\nNaza walked in from outside the door. As\nsoon as she approached the sofa, before\nshe could even speak, Wayi Wu shoved the\nOkamoto 0.01 into her hand. Naza shook\nthe box and then asked a question with a\ncurious look on her face. Young master,\nwhat is this? Is it delicious forehead?\nWeii Wu, who was about to speak, was\nimmediately choked by these words. As\nfor eating it, it is edible, but it's\nnot the proper kind of food, and it\ndoesn't taste good, and you can't\nswallow it. All right. All right. I\ncalled you here to burn this thing. I\ncan't stand the sight of it. Naza had\noriginally wanted to secretly try it,\nbut upon hearing we wu&lt;unk&gt;s words, she\nimmediately abandoned the idea. After\nNaza left, Wayi Wu muttered something\nunder his breath. System, are you\nkidding me? You want my dearest little\nbrother to wear a kimono? Absolutely\nnot. Moreover, if any respectable\nnewlywed couple uses this thing, even\nthe thinnest condom will create a\nbarrier to their passionate love. After\nsaying that, Wayi Wu looked toward his\nbedroom with a burning heart and a\nfighting spirit. Weii Wu strode into the\nroom. That silky smooth, exhilarating\nblack combined with Zhu Yuswan's\nmagnificent ancient costume. The direct\nand intense visual impact caused Weii\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s anim animalistic instincts to\noutweigh his rationality. Tonight, he\nwas determined to be someone who tossed\nand turned in bed with Zuyu Schwan.\nMeanwhile, while was engrossed in the\ngreat battle, a letter that originated\nin Shandong was delivered to a large\nmansion in the capital. Interestingly,\nthis house was the residence of the\nImperial Sensor Hong, who had previously\nhad a grudge against Weii Wu. With a\nreverent expression, Imperial Sensor\nHang unfolded the letter with trembling\nhands. After reading the letter, a\nresolute look flashed in Imperial Sensor\nHangs eyes, and then he burned the\nletter to ashes. As night fell and stars\nshifted, a ray of light rose from the\nhorizon, tearing through the darkness.\nWayi Wu emerged from the room,\nsupporting his back, still reliving the\nscene of Gao Ran from the previous\nnight. Fortunately, he still had the\nimportant matter on his mind and rushed\nto the science and technology institute\nearly in the morning to find Song Jong.\nSummon all the artisans to the\nclassroom. There is something very\nimportant to announce today. Chapter 140\nusing technological achievements to slap\nthem in the face. A few minutes later,\nin a packed classroom, all the\ncraftsmen's eyes were fixed on Wayi Woo,\nwho was standing on the stage. In the\npast, Wayi Wu always had a rather\neasygoing expression when lecturing. But\ntoday, his expression was very serious.\nUpon seeing this expression, the\ncraftsman began to wonder if something\nhad happened. Just as everyone was\nwondering, Wayi Woo, who was standing on\nstage, spoke, \"Everyone, you've been at\nthe Academy of Sciences for a while now.\nI want to ask you something, and you\nmust answer me truthfully.\" After saying\nthis, Wayi Wu looked around and then\ncontinued, \"In your eyes, is my research\ninstitute a place that brings disaster\nto the country and its people?\" The\ncraftsmen, who were still puzzled,\nimmediately frowned upon hearing this.\nThey were among the first to come to the\nAcademy of Sciences, so they naturally\nknew very well how amazing the knowledge\nthey learned here was. Not only will it\nenable us to better understand a world,\nbut it will also allow us to create\nmechanical tools that are beyond human\ncapabilities, but ways now clearly\nindicate that someone is trying to\nslander the Academy of Sciences. Having\nlong regarded the Academy of Sciences as\ntheir second home, how could they\ntolerate their studies being slandered?\nSo, after Wayi Wu finished asking his\nquestion, Sean was the first to stand\nup. Vice President, is someone targeting\nus? try to destroy our science\ninstitute. Sean&lt;unk&gt;s words immediately\narouse the anger and concern of the\nothers. Vice dean, who exactly want to\nharm us? Vice president, is his majesty\ndissatisfied with our Academy of\nSciences and planning to shut it down?\nNo way. We've even built a steam engine.\nHis majesty wouldn't do that, would he?\nJust as everyone was asking questions,\nWayi Wu raised a hand and the scene\nimmediately quieted down. everyone. It's\nnot that his majesty wants to shut down\nour Academy of Sciences, but rather that\nsome people can't stand the existence of\nour Academy of Sciences. Yesterday, I\nwent to the palace and his majesty told\nme that recently there have been people\nsubmitting memorials, criticizing and\nsmearing our Academy of Sciences. They\nsay our Academy of Sciences spends all\nday researching strange and ingenious\ntechniques, that we advocate unhealthy\ntrends and evil practices, and that we\nwill only bring disaster to the country\nand its people in the future. Wayi Wu\npaused for a moment at this point before\ncontinuing. Those officials have made no\ncontribution to the Ming dynasty, yet\nthey still try to harm those of us who\nare working hard to contribute. In their\neyes, only scholars are the pillars of a\nnation. While we craftsmen are nothing\nbut trash, don't they think about what\nthey would live in if there were no\ncraftsmen to build houses and what they\nwould eat if there were no craftsmen to\nmake cooking utensils? What would they\ndo without craftsmen building carriages?\nCould they live such a stable life\nwithout craftsmen inventing firearms?\nThey question us, look down on us, and\neven belittle us. So, what should we do?\nEvery word Chow Chow said struck a chord\nwith these craftsmen. They're highly\nskilled, but most of them barely make\nends meet and have no savings. Those\nofficials at the top are utterly\nincompetent. All they do is give orders\nhalf-hazardly, telling them to do this\nand that. In the end, if anything goes\nwrong, it's those at the very bottom who\nbear the responsibility. Now that they\nfinally come to the Academy of Sciences,\nthey don't have to worry about others\nopinions. They can just focus on doing\nwhat they love. As a result, these same\npeople jumped out again, ready to\ndestroy the place that allowed them to\nstand up straight. How could they not be\nangry and upset? However, no matter how\nangry they were, they could only\nsuppress their anger. Because of a huge\ngap in their social status, they had\nabsolutely no ability to resist. But at\nthat moment, Wayi Wu's words rekindled\ntheir hope. Since you don't know, then\nI, as the vice dean, will tell you. What\nwe need to do is produce outstanding\nresults. Then we'll use these\nachievements to slap them in the face\nand show them whether we're harming the\ncountry or benefiting it. As for this\nmatter, I've already spoken to his\nmajesty, and his majesty supports us in\ndoing so. So, you don't need to worry at\nall. Upon hearing Wei Wu say that Zhu\nYuan Jang also supported it. The\ncraftsman's enthusiasm was instantly\nignited with the emperor backing them\nup. What do they have to fear? They have\nnothing to be afraid of. Although the\nAcademy of Sciences has few achievements\nto date, it only has a steam engine and\ncement. Even so, these two things alone\nare enough to shock the world. Just as\neveryone was filled with fighting\nspirit, weii Wu spoke up again. His\nmajesty and I have agreed that in seven\ndays we will invite officials,\nmerchants, and common people to witness\nthe achievements of the Academy of\nSciences. After speaking, Wayi Wu looked\ndirectly at the carpenters group and a\nblacksmith's group. Seong Sun Chong, you\nknow those pleasure boats along the\nChinuai River, right? The two who were\noriginally looking forward to showing\noff their skills were caught off guard\nwhen we w mentioned this. After a while,\nthe two of them said, looking somewhat\nembarrassed. Um, I've seen it, but I've\nnever been there. I've heard of it, but\nI've never seen it. Looking at their\nexpressions, Wayi Wu couldn't help but\nwant to laugh. Indeed, they were all\ncraftsmen from the Ministry of Works,\nand their income could not support the\nexpenses of the Pleasure Boat. Whether\nyou've heard of it or not, whether\nyou've seen it or not, that's not\nimportant. What's important is that\nyou're going now. Buy a boat, like a\npleasure boat, and then find a way to\nmodify the stern and install a steam\nengine and propeller on it. Seven days\nfrom now, I want to see a ship that can\nsail on a Yangty River without wind,\nsails, or ores. Consider this\npreparation for building large steam\nships in the future so you can get used\nto in advance and tell me if you can do\nit. Way himself didn't realize that his\nwords had struck a chord with both of\nthem. Since the steam engine\nsuccessfully ran yesterday, they have\nbeen thinking about how to modify and\napply it to the ship. After we woo left\nlast night, the two guys stayed up late\ndiscussing things until after 3:00 a.m.\nbefore finally going to sleep. Now that\nthis opportunity has been presented to\nthem, you can imagine how excited they\nare. So, when we woo finished speaking,\ntheir eyes practically lit up with\nexcitement. Vice Dean, please rest\nassured, we will definitely handle this\nmatter well and will not let you down.\nThat's right. Even if we don't eat or\nsleep, we will definitely build a ship.\nTo be honest, Wayi Wu never expected\nthese two guys to be so motivated. But\nthis is exactly what he wanted to see.\nAll right, you can withdraw the money\nfor the pleasure bow from the Academy of\nScience and Technologies account. Go\nahead. Having received Weii Wu&lt;unk&gt;s\napproval, the two who had been eagerly\nwaiting immediately turned around and\nran out of the classroom. Seeing that\ntheir team leaders had left, the\ncarpenters and blacksmiths also ran out.\nAfter all these people had left, Wayi Wu\nturned his attention to the firearms\ngroup and the construction group. He\noriginally planned to deal with the\nfirearms group first, but the problems\nwith the firearms group might be a bit\nmore complicated. The construction team\nonly needs to highlight the advantages\nof cement. Let's just get the\nconstruction team sorted out first. Wu\nChong, you've already figured out the\ncement formula. So, next I'll tell you\nhow to make concrete. Chapter 141 C25\nconcrete and flint lock gun. In fact,\naccording to Wei Wu's idea, he still\nhoped that Wu Chong and the others could\nexperiment with concrete themselves. But\nthis is a special case and we need to be\nin a hurry, so we don't need to worry\nabout those things. When Wu Chong and\nhis team members heard that Wayi Woo had\nsomething new, they immediately perked\nup. A group of people stared intently at\nWayi Woo, like children yearning for a\ntoy. Actually, concrete is very simple.\nYou just need to mix cement, sand,\ngravel, and water to make concrete.\nAfter explaining how the concrete was\nmade, Wayi Wu also explained the mixed\nproportions for C-25. Then he continued\nto instruct Wu Chong on what to do for\nthis exhibition of scientific and\ntechnological achievements. I want you\nto pave part of the ground in the\nscience institute with concrete\nflooring. The water wheel for the\ncarpenters group is finished. There's no\ntime to build the blast furnace right\nnow, so we'll grind the stones for you\nfirst. When it comes to concrete, Wu\nalso struggled with how to showcase its\nsuperiority. Considering its function is\nconstruction, the decision was\nultimately made to pave the road for the\nAcademy of Sciences since it would\nbenefit our own people anyway. However,\nthere is a problem. The concrete takes\nabout 28 hours to set. However, the\nconcrete is not hard enough at this\npoint and needs 7 days of wet curing to\nreach 70% of its design strength. It\nwill take 28 days to reach 100% of the\ndesign strength. Waywood doesn't need\n100% strength in his design. 70% is\nenough. But making cement takes time and\nhe only has 7 days, which is clearly not\nenough. Then we'll have to resort to\nsome auxiliary methods. Go back and find\nthe blacksmith team and have them make\nyou something that can spray steam.\nAfter the concrete is laid, it is\nsprayed with steam at 40% to 60% heat\nevery day. This is called steam curing.\nThe setting time of concrete depends on\ntemperature and humidity. Using steam at\ntemperatures between 40 and 60° C can\nshorten the hardening process of\nconcrete by about 30%. After providing\nall the key information, Wu Chong\nimmediately led his team to start work.\nMeanwhile, Wayi Wu finally focused his\nattention on the firearms group. Yang\nXiao, do you have any clues about\nsomething that can make gunpowder more\npowerful? Upon hearing we woo&lt;unk&gt;s\nwords, the expressions on the faces of\nthe three members of the firearms team\nimmediately turned awkward. Reporting to\nthe vice dean, \"We are incompetent and\nhave not yet been able to find the thing\nyou mentioned.\" Wayi Wu was not\ndisappointed by this answer as\nunderstanding the changes in matter is\ninherently difficult. Moreover, the\nthree people in front of us were\ntransferred here later. So, after Yang\nXiao finished speaking, Wei Wu simply\nnodded calmly. I can tell you the\nanswer, but in return, your award will\nno longer be valid. Upon hearing the\nconditions offered by Wei Wu, Yang Xiao\nand the other two had no objections.\nThey did want the money, but they also\nwanted to earn the reward through their\nown abilities. Now, in the science and\ntechnology institute, the construction\nteam has produced cement, and the\ncarpentry and blacksmith teams have even\nbuilt a steam engine. Everyone else had\nimpressive achievements, but their\nfirearms group hadn't made a single\nmove. Although they were all colleagues,\nno one looked at them differently and no\none spoke ill of them. But they can't\nget over their own hurdle. When they're\nwith other people, they always feel like\nthey're sitting on pins and needles.\nFurthermore, with the Academy of\nSciences now facing scrutiny, it's\nclearly not the time for them to\nstubbornly defend themselves. So, after\nWayi Wu finished speaking, Yang Xiao\nimmediately gave his own answer. Vice,\nplease tell us. We have failed to meet\nyour requirements and are too ashamed to\naccept your reward. Wayi Wu had guessed\nthis would be the answer, so he\nimmediately gave the result. It's white\nsugar. Adding white sugar to gunpowder\nat a ratio of 1/10enth of the\ngunpowder's weight can increase its\npower several times over. After\nexplaining about the sugar, we wanted to\nsee the surprised expressions on Yong\nXiao's and the others faces. The result\nwas the opposite. Instead of being\nsurprised, the group looked puzzled.\nJust as Wei Wu was wondering why they\nhad such expressions, Yong Chow finally\nspoke. \"Vice, may I ask what white sugar\nis? Is it like granulated sugar that\nsweet edible stuff? If it's brown sugar,\nI've actually tried it before. Although\nthe gunpowder has changed, the power\nhasn't increased. Brown sugar is what we\nnow call red sugar. It's just that it\nhad a different name in ancient times.\nUpon hearing Yong Chao mention brown\nsugar, Weii Wu finally remembered a\ncrucial question. It seems that white\nsugar did not exist during the early\nMing dynasty. Specifically during the\nHong Wu era, only brown sugar could be\nmade from sugar cane. Although there are\nrecords of white sugar as early as the\nTang Dynasty, it was actually not white\nsugar at all. It is simply a type of\nsugar with a brighter color than brown\nsugar and raw sugar. It wasn't until the\nJaing era that China produced sugar\ncrystals that were truly free of\nimpurities and had a snow white color.\nIn other words, Yang Xiao and his two\ncompanions weren't incompetent. They\nwere simply incapable of providing an\nanswer. Realizing this, Wayi Wu couldn't\nhelp but feel a little embarrassed. This\nwhole thing had been handled terribly.\nBut then I thought, if we don't have\nwhite sugar now, wouldn't it be a\nfortune to make it ourselves? It's\nimportant to know that during the\njudging era, white sugar was incredibly\nexpensive. One tale of white sugar was\nequivalent to one tale of silver. But\nnow is not the time to think about that.\nSince it is his own problem, we will not\ndeny that he was wrong. It's my fault.\nIt was my oversight. I forgot that you\ndidn't even know what white sugar was,\nand I made you go to all that trouble to\nfind it. All right, then. I'll give you\na new mission as a reward for the\ngunpowder. Once you complete it, you'll\nreceive it as usual. Furthermore, on the\nday the academyy's achievements are\nshowcased, I will bring out white sugar\nso you can see its power for yourselves.\nTo be honest, Wayi Wu&lt;unk&gt;s words didn't\nreally constitute an apology, but Yong\nChow and the other two didn't care. What\nthey're most concerned about now is what\ntask Weu will give them next.\nFurthermore, I'm even more eager to hear\nwhat we Wu said about how much the power\nof gunpowder could be increased by\nadding white sugar. Seeing the expectant\nlooks in their eyes, Wei Wu didn't keep\nthem in suspense and spoke directly. The\ntask I originally gave you was to\nprovide only partial information and\nthen have you work hard to complete it.\nHowever, the situation is special now.\nSo, I will tell you all the information\nas a way to make up for the previous\nsugar mission. The task I'm assigning\nyou this time is to create a firearm\ncalled a flint lock musket, but I don't\nhave any blueprints for you. As they\nspoke, Wayi Wu took out a pen from his\nbosom and began to draw on the paper\nwhile explaining to the three of them.\nThe biggest difference between a flint\nlock musket and modern firearms is that\nit does not rely on an open flame to\nignite, but on flint. Fix the flint to\nthis thing called a trigger, and then\nfix a flint and steel in front of the\nflint. When the trigger is pulled, the\nflint strikes the flint and steel,\ncreating a spark that ignites the\ngunpowder chamber and completes the\nfiring. At this point, Wayi Woo suddenly\nlooked up at the three members of the\nfirearms team and ask them a question.\nAlthough my drawing is somewhat\nabstract, I think you should be able to\nunderstand it with your abilities.\nChapter 142, rifled flint lock musket\nwith many bullets equals invincibility.\nAll I can say is that in all honesty and\nconscience, I have no right to say this.\nWhat Chow Chow painted went far beyond\nwhat can be described as abstract. Only\nthe trigger and the overall shape of the\ngun are somewhat recognizable. The rest\nis simply unbearable to look at. He drew\nthe gun barrel as narrow at the front\nand thick at the back with crooked lines\nthat weren't straight at all.\nFortunately, Yang Xiao and his two\ncompanions were quite skilled and had\nalready figured out the key information\nabout the flint lock musket. Although\nWeii Wu's drawing wasn't very good, they\nstill looked at the drawing as if it\nwere a treasure. As I've said before,\nChina has never lacked talent. What it\nlacks is inspiration and direction. We\nwu&lt;unk&gt;s current diagram has already\ncompleted both of these elements. At\nthis moment, the three of them no longer\nlooked at wei Wu with respect, but\nworshiped him as if he were their\npatriarch. So, when they heard Wu&lt;unk&gt;s\nquestion, they immediately nodded to\nindicate that they understood. However,\njust in case, Wayi Wu continued to\nexplain to them. The barrel of a flint\nlock musket is made of mild steel and\nmust be balanced from end to end. The\nstock can be made of wood. The gun is\nabout 3 ft and 1 in long, and the barrel\nis about 1 ft and 9 in long. Rifling\nneeds to be drawn out inside the barrel.\nThe so-called rifling is just a series\nof spiral lines that run from beginning\nto end on the inner wall of the barrel.\nThat's it. He couldn't explain it\nclearly with words alone. So, Wayi Wu\nonce again picked up a pen and drew it\non paper. It must be said that he is\nindeed not good at drawing straight\nlines, but he is even worse at drawing\ncurves. Fortunately, the three members\nof the firearms team were all very\nclever, and by listening and observing,\nthey managed to figure out what rifling\nwas. The rifling is spiral-shaped. The\nraised ones are called convex lines, and\nthe concave ones are called concave\nlines. It plays a very important role.\nAfter the gunpowder is ignited, the\nprojectile will spin along the rifling,\nand the projectile will travel farther\nand be more accurate. The faster the\nprojectile spins, the higher its\nstability. However, the speed of spin is\nrelated to the twist rate of the\nrifling. At this point, Wayi Wu suddenly\nremembered that he had something he\ncould use for a demonstration. He then\nreached in his pocket, pulled out the\nstun gun, and ran his fingers across its\nsurface. The so-called twist rate is the\ndistance the rifling travels in one\nrevolution inside the barrel like this.\nDo you understand? With Wei Woo teaching\nso diligently, the three members of the\nfirearms team dared not be distracted.\nHe immediately nodded to show that he\nunderstood, and indeed he did understand\nafter Wei Woos vivid demonstration.\nSeeing that they all understood, we woo\nfinally breathed a sigh of relief. But\nthen he started drawing on the paper\nagain while continuing to mutter, \"In\naddition, I also want you to make a type\nof bullet. Not the old kind of bullet,\nbut this kind of roundheaded cylindrical\nshell. This type of bullet is called a\nmini bullet. It is made of lead and has\na conical hole at the bottom which is\nfilled with cork. Wayi Wu's drawing this\ntime is quite good. He has completely\ndepicted the shape of the Manurva. In\nfact, Wayi Wu had already prepared his\nideas about flint lock musketss and many\nbullets long ago. Previously, he had\nonly thought of smooth boore flint lock\nmusketss and ordinary bullets. But now\nwith the machine tools delivered by the\nsystem, it is entirely possible to\nmanufacture rifled flint lock musketss\nand many bullets. If it weren't for the\nfact that metal-loaded ammunition is too\ncumbersome, current basic technology\nwouldn't be able to massproduce it. He\nwas so eager to achieve instant success\nthat he went straight for the firing\ngun. The problem is that issues with\npower, materials, and manufacturing\nprocesses alone are enough to completely\nblock his progress. Although rifled\nflint lock musketss have various\ndrawbacks, they're far superior to\nsmooth boore flint lock musketss.\nMoreover, it has surpassed the world's\nfirearms development by several hundred\nyears. The maximum range of a smooth\nboore flint lock musket is only 200 m\nand usually 140 m is about right and its\naccuracy is appalling. However, rifled\nflint lock musketss have a minimum range\nof 280 to 500 meters and when used with\nmini bullets, their maximum range can\nreach 800 meters. The reason lies in the\nconicle cavity at the bottom of the mini\nbullet and the cork used to fill it.\nWhen the gunpowder in the gun is\nignited, the explosive blast pushes the\ncork filling the cartridge tightly\nagainst the tail. The effect is achieved\nby expanding the tail of the projectile\nto enhance its air tightness combined\nwith the rifling. The key is that this\nbullet can easily enter the barrel,\ngreatly increasing the reload speed and\nfiring frequency. When we woo explained\nthe effects of the rifled flint lock\nmusket and the mini bullet, the three\nmembers of the firearms team were\npractically going crazy, their eyes\nfilled with blatant fanaticism. He\nseemed even more anxious than Seong and\nSun Chan from before. as if he couldn't\nwait to manufacture the weapon. After a\nbrief period of euphoria, Yong Sha was\nthe first to calm down and think about a\nkey issue. Dean, as you said, this\nrifled flint lock musket can indeed be a\nbattlefield weapon. It's just that I'm\nafraid I don't have the ability to\nmanufacture it. The rifling you\nmentioned requires too much precision.\nYong Sha also wanted to make the weapon,\nbut he simply couldn't figure out how to\nmake the rifling. But just as he was\nfilled with regret and helplessness, he\nsaw that we wu still had a smile on his\nface. That faint smile gave him a\nglimmer of hope. Sure enough, not long\nafter he finished speaking, Weii Wu\nspoke up. I actually have a solution for\nthe rifling problem, and the blacksmith\nteam has the same solution. You're just\nlimited by your old ways of thinking.\nHave you forgotten that we have a steam\nengine now? How to do this with a steam\nengine is something you need to figure\nout yourself. I can only tell you about\nbrooching or extrusion. In fact, Wayiu\nwas referring to the brooching method\nand the hammer forging method. The\nformer requires repeated brooing back\nand forth multiple times. The latter\ncannot be done by human power. It can\nonly be done by utilizing the powerful\nmechanical energy of a steam engine.\nSeeing Yong Chow lost in thought, Wayi\nWu shook his head and told him to come\nback to his senses. All right, you can\nthink about the specifics later when you\nhave time. I just want you to be able to\nthink, not for you to do it. I have more\nprofessional tools here that can handle\nrifling. You guys wait here until I call\nyou to come out. After saying that, Wayi\nWoo walked out of the classroom and took\nout a milling and turning machine and a\npower bank. Fortunately, this time we\ngot this kind of machine tool. It would\nhave been troublesome if it had been a\nlarge CNC machine tool. However,\nordinary people simply can't handle that\nstuff. The various data can be\noverwhelming. Just getting it to start\nis a big problem. Large machinery is a\nmajor energy consumer and Wayi Woo only\nhas a portable power bank with a storage\ncapacity of 20 kowatt hours. Is it used\nto power large CNC machine tools? That's\nas ridiculous as a virgin boy boasting\nthat he'll take down a 40-year-old widow\nwho's been single for 18 years. After\ndoing all this, we woo called out the\nthree members of the firearms team and\nasked them to help carry the weapons\ninto the house. This thing is called a\nmachine tool. A precious tool used for\nprecision machining of metal objects.\nNow it's yours to handle. In fact, Wayi\nWu himself had never studied it. But he\ndid have a classmate who was a\ntechnician in this field. I've tried\nusing machine tools a few times out of\ncuriosity before. Although I'm not an\nexpert, I understand the basic\noperations. After a brief demonstration,\nwere dumbfounded. Upon seeing this, Wayi\nWu laughed. Stop daydreaming. Besides\nthe flint lock musket, I have two other\ntypes of cannons here that you also need\nto make. Chapter 143. Come taste my\nwhite stuff. In the same way, explain\nwhile drawing. 2 hours later, the three\nmembers of the firearms team, as if they\nhad found a treasure, began to tinker\nwith the machine tool. Seeing that the\nthree of them were engrossed in their\nstudies, we woo did not disturb them and\nquietly left the classroom. Nowadays,\nalmost everyone at the institute has\ntheir own things to do. But Professor\nWei Woo has become quite idle. However,\nhe wasn't idle. He took advantage of the\ntime to get the white sugar out. When\nthe sea ban is lifted in the future,\nlarge quantities of white sugar will be\ndumped out and making money will be as\neasy as taking candy from a baby. Now\nthat the steam engine has been built and\nwith the help of machine tools provided\nby the system, we can finally get\nstarted. The remaining issue is the\ndesign of the mechanical structure,\nwhich is no problem for carpenters. It\nshouldn't be long before a steam power\nsystem suitable for large treasure ships\ncan be built. Having made up his mind,\nWayiu didn't want to delay any longer\nand left the Academy of Sciences to go\nhome. Originally, I wanted to find\nmanager Huang, but I learned that he was\ncurrently busy with the renovation of\nthe Behigh Chowing building. He was also\nbusy selling Manglan Gin Shang pills to\nthe brothel owners in Chinuai River. so\nbusy that he had no time to spare. At\nthis moment, Wayi Wu truly realized that\nhe had far too few manpower available.\nThe person isn't the most important\nthing. What matters is having someone\nyou can trust. Otherwise, there will be\ntoo many problems later on. Nestled on\nthe sofa, Weii Wu frowned as he pondered\nhow to solve the manpower problem. Just\nthen, Ching Xiao walked in carrying a\nbasin of water, preparing to clean the\nhouse. Upon seeing her appear, Weii\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s eyes immediately lit up. Wasn't\nthis the perfect candidate? Previously,\nBridget Lynn was injured and Betteran\nand coincidentally, manager Huang was\ntransferred to the Beeh High Chowing\nrestaurant. She's been handling the\nhousehold accounts all this time, and\nshe's done a pretty good job. The real\nchallenge with White Sugar is how to\nmake it. Once you have the ingredients,\nyou don't have to worry about sales. All\nyou need is someone you trust to oversee\nthe accounts. Thinking of this, Wayi Wu\nwaved to Ching Xia. Ching Xia, don't do\nthe cleaning yet. Come and sit down. I\nhave something to tell you. Upon hearing\nWeii Wu&lt;unk&gt;s words, Ching Sha\nimmediately put down the rag in her hand\nand quickly sat down next to Wayi Wu.\nYou don't need to do anything at home\nanymore. I plan to have you manage the\nshop for me, just like manager Hong.\nChing Xiao was still wondering what we\nwas going to say when she was completely\nstunned after hearing it. Although the\nMing dynasty did not prohibit women from\nengaging in commerce, it was easy for\nwomen to attract criticism if they went\nout in public. Zhu Xi proposed the\nChunghu school of neoconfucianism during\nthe northern Song Dynasty and by the\nSouthern Song Dynasty, it had become\nwidely accepted. It was under the\ninfluence of Chongjhu Neo Confucianism\nthat women began to be restricted by\nvarious rules and regulations. Women in\nthe Sway and Tang dynasties enjoyed\nfreedom of speech and were allowed to\nremarry while women in the northern Song\nDynasty could file for divorce from\ntheir husbands. In dynasties following\nthe Southern Song Dynasty, women's\nstatus declined further and further.\nThey were bound by the ideas that it was\nbetter to starve to death than to lose\none's chastity and the three obedes and\nfour virtues. During the Ming dynasty,\nwomen were not allowed to remarry. And\nduring theqing dynasty, women were\nconfined to their homes and had\nextremely low social status. Now that\nway, Wu has suddenly proposed that she\nbecome the female manager. She's\ninevitably a little stunned, but she is\nstill somewhat tempted. She was\noriginally from a wealthy family, but\nwas implicated and ended up in the\nbrothel. She had already resigned\nherself to her fate. Whether one becomes\na prostitute to be played with or a\nslave to be scolded and driven is all\nfate. She had already accepted her fate,\nbut she never expected to be sent to\nWeii Wu. Although she was still a\nservant, she could feel respected and\nlive like a human being. This is indeed\nthe case, and the reason is quite\nsimple. Although he came to the Ming\ndynasty, Chow Chow's thinking was still\nthat of a modern person from later\ngenerations. Although the servants in\nhis household were slaves, he\nsubconsciously viewed them as employees.\nIt's like the employment relationship\nbetween gardeners and cooks in the homes\nof wealthy people in later generations.\nThey certainly wouldn't treat their\nservants like human beings as the nobles\nand gentry of today do with an arrogant\nattitude. This is why Ching Xiao was\nmore disciplined and valued rules more\nthan the other maids. Because of this\nrespect, she felt she should do her job\nwell. Now that fate has presented her\nwith another opportunity, how could she\nnot be tempted? Although Ching Xia\ndidn't show it, Wayiu could still tell\nthat she was somewhat interested. So he\nspoke again. Ching Xia, you must have\ndrunk brown sugar water before. Yes, a\nwoman cannot go 100 days without sugar.\nIn the past, when my family had some\nwealth, we would drink it occasionally.\nAs soon as Ching Xiao finished speaking,\nWei Wu took out a bag of Snow White\nsalt-like white cotton candy. Come try\nthis white thing of mine. As he spoke,\nWayi Wu tore open the bag and poured\nsome white sugar into Ching Sha&lt;unk&gt;s\nhand. Looking at the delicate white\nsugar that was as smooth and fluffy as\nsnow, Ching Sha felt a pang of\nreluctance. However, under Wii Wu&lt;unk&gt;s\ngaze, she still put the white sugar to\nher lips and gently licked it with her\ntongue. The moment the sugar melts, a\nsweet nectar-like flavor is released in\nthe mouth. Unlike brown sugar, white\nsugar doesn't have that strong sugar\ncane flavor. It only has a very pure\nsweet taste. The novelty of it made\nBridget Lynn, who had never eaten white\nsugar before, unable to resist licking\nthe snowflake like white sugar from her\npalm again. At this moment, Wayi Wu\nfinally spoke up. Currently, all the\nsugar in the Ming Dynasty is black and\ndark red. But I have a way to make this\nkind of white sugar. Next, I plan to buy\na few workshops to specialize in making\nthis kind of white sugar. I've already\ncome up with a name for it, snowflake\nsugar. Once it's produced, there's no\nworry about selling it. However, the\nprice is very high, so the accounts need\nto be overseen by someone we trust. Weii\nWu then explained the method of making\nwhite sugar to Ching Xia. It was not\ndifficult, but the steps were a bit\ntedious. Like brown sugar, the juice is\nfirst extracted from sugar cane, then\nfiltered to remove the sugar cane\nresidue. At this stage, the brown sugar\nis boiled down by turning the heat from\nhigh to low to evaporate the water, thus\nmaking brown sugar. But white sugar is\ndifferent. There's a record of it in the\nbook Tion Gong Kaiu, the exploitation of\nthe works of nature, which is called the\nyellow mud water sugar lamination\nmethod. Many people in later generations\ntry to make the sugar but failed. In\nfact, they fell into a misconception.\nThe records mention yellow mud and they\nactually used yellow mud. In fact, the\nso-called yellow mud water refers to\nkalin, also known as benite because the\nnatural soil color in the Guangdong and\nGuang Sea regions is mainly red.\nTherefore, kalin is called lust and\nthat's how yellow mud water came about.\nThis type of soil has a super strong\nabsorption capacity which can carry away\nimpurities. Many food and pharmaceutical\nfactories still use it today to make\nwhite sugar. After filtering out the\nresidue, kalin needs to be added to the\nsugar cane juice and stirred for six\nhours. Then let it settle for about two\nhours until all the impurities have\nsettled to the bottom. Then take the\nclear sugar solution from the top. But\nthat's not the end. This process needs\nto be repeated two or three more times\nand then boiled with clear sugar syrup.\nEvaporate about 2/3 of the water from\nthe sugar solution. The remaining\nmolasses once solidified becomes the\nwhite sugar described in the ancient\nChinese classic Tong Gong Kaiu. Bridget\nLynn listened attentively, afraid of\nmissing any crucial steps, she waited\nuntil we wu stopped drinking water\nbefore taking the opportunity to ask him\na question. Sir, will this make the same\nsnow white sugar as yours? However, we\nwu shook his head. No, this is just the\ninitial white sugar. Not as white as the\none I have in my hand. There is one more\nstep next. Chapter 144. Impeaching Wei\nWoo. Imperial sensor Hang strikes a\npillar in front of the palace. Actually,\nwe're pretty much done at this step. The\nresulting caramel coloring wasn't as\nwhite as the industrially produced white\nsugar that Wayi Wu had, but it was still\nquite good. But if you're going to do\nit, you have to do it to the best of\nyour ability. How can he not produce a\nmasterpiece? Next, the molasses needs to\nundergo one last step, which requires\nmaking a small tool. I call this thing a\nmolasses separator. Think of it as a\nconstantly spinning saucer placed in a\ncontainer like a bucket or a water tank.\nSprinkle the boiled molasses little by\nlittle on top and use the rotation to\nshake the crystallized thick sugar\nliquid into white sugar frosting. It's\nno use just talking about it. I'll have\nthe carpenters at the science institute\nmake it later and then you'll know what\nit is. The main function of a molasses\nseparator is to use centrifugal force to\nthrow molasses onto a civ and then\ncollect it to make white sugar. However,\nwe didn't know how to explain\ncentrifugal force to Chinia. So, he\nsimply glossed over it. Once the product\nis made, you'll naturally know how to\noperate it. These are all things to come\nlater. What you need to do now is to ask\nYuan for the money and go to the\nbrokerage to see if there are any\nsugar-making workshops. After we woo\nfinished speaking, Ching Xiao\nimmediately nodded to indicate that she\nunderstood, but she did not set off\nimmediately. Instead, he stood silently\nfor a while, then looked at Wayi Wu and\nsaid, \"Sir, I think Wait, it's fine if\neveryone else calls you master, but you\nlittle mage should call me young master.\nI'm used to it.\" Ching Xiao was taken a\nback for a moment, then burst into\nlaughter. Yes, young master. I think if\nwe're going to buy, it would be best to\nspend more money and buy two or three\nworkshops. Hearing what Ching Xia said,\nWayi Wu chuckled inwardly. This girl was\nclearly getting into the zone. However,\nhe was somewhat curious as to why the\ngirl would say that. Why do you want to\nbuy more? Tell me your reasons. Upon\nhearing this, Bridget Lynn immediately\ngave her answer. Young master, the white\nsugar made using this method is not only\nexquisite but also delicate, and it will\nsurely be sought after by nobles and\ngentry. But the method of making it is\nunique to you, young master. Since\nthat's the case, we must keep it\nstrictly confidential. If it were stolen\nby someone else, wouldn't the young\nmaster's hard work have been given away\nfor nothing? I will never allow that to\nhappen. At this point, Bridget Lynn's\nface even showed a strong anger as if\nthe method of making white sugar had\nreally been leaked. Then I heard her\ncontinue speaking. So I want to separate\nthe sugar making process into two or\neven three workshops, each responsible\nfor a different process. First of all,\nyoung master, regarding the kalin you\nmentioned, Ching Shia thinks we should\nfind someone specifically to be\nresponsible for purchasing and storing\nthis soil. A fixed amount of soil was\ndelivered to the workshop every once in\na while, and it was said to be yellow\nclay, whether it was for the workers in\nthe workshop or for others. Weii Wu\nnever expected that Ching Xia's request\nto buy several workshops was actually to\nkeep it a secret for him, but sounded\nquite interesting, so he nodded to\nsignal Ching Xia to continue. With Wayi\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s approval, Ching Sha became more\nrelaxed and spoke more freely. Secondly,\nthe extraction, stirring, and\nsedimentation steps can be done together\nbecause separating them is useless as\nyou can still smell the sugar cane.\nHowever, the clear sugar solution\nobtained after sedimentation can be\ntransported to other workshops so that\nwe can take charge of the boiling\nprocess. In this way, the workshop can\nalso achieve proficiency through\npractice such as controlling the heat\nand knowing when to take it out of the\npot. Finally, the molasses is boiled\ndown and then the white sugar is\nseparated out using the kind of molasses\nseparator you mentioned, young master.\nIt must be said that Ching Xiao's\nremarks did make Wayu look at her in a\ndifferent light. It wasn't just her\nstrict adherence to secrecy. More\nimportantly, she inadvertently revealed\nthe production line. The high efficiency\nof assembly lines is largely due to the\nfact that practice makes perfect. So\nafter Ching Xia finished speaking, Wayi\nWu immediately raised his hand to\napplaud her. Excellent. Really\nexcellent, Ching Xia. Now I have even\nmore faith in your abilities. I feel\nvery reassured in trusting the sugar\nbusiness to you. Then this matter will\nbe left to you. However, the Academy of\nScience and Technology is quite busy\nlately and the craftsman cannot spare\nthe time of the moment. Here's what\nwe'll do. You buy the workshop first and\nprepare the personnel and materials.\nOnce the science institute is done with\nits work, I'll have them make the honey\nseparator. Upon receiving Weii Wu&lt;unk&gt;s\naffirmation, Chingsha immediately\nsmiled. Yes, young master. I'll go to\nthe accounting office to find the madam\nright now. We've been quite busy lately,\nmostly at the Academy of Sciences. So,\nwhen he wasn't home, Xiushwan wasn't\nidle either. He usually stayed in the\naccounting office. She meticulously\nrecords every single expense and income\nin the household. As the saying goes,\nyou won't go broke from eating or\ndressing, but you'll be poor your whole\nlife if you don't plan ahead. Zu Yushwan\nhas certainly done a great job in this\nregard. I always remember Wei Woo saying\nthat men should be in charge of external\naffairs and women should be in charge of\ninternal affairs and I'm wholeheartedly\ntrying to make this family better. After\nChing Sha left, Wayi Wu also left the\nmansion and headed towards the Imperial\nMedical Academy. He was planning to go\nfind physician Sue to see if Shan Lin\nand the others had prepared their\nmedicine and his own helan. However,\nWayi Wu was unaware that a grand drama\nconcerning him was unfolding in the\nfunction hall. The protagonist of this\nplay is none other than Imperial Sensor\nHong with whom he had a previous\nentanglement. Last time he provoked Wei\nWu, he not only failed but also got 20\nlashes from Xu Yuan Jang. Although only\ntend the blows were real, the guy was\nstill injured. Today, this imperial\nsensor Hong, despite his still\nunreovered body, stands proudly before\nthe main hall. At this point, the court\nhad already discussed most of the\nmatters and was about to adjourn. But\nthen, Imperial sensor Hang suddenly\nstepped forward, looked at Zhu Yuan Jang\non the dragon throne, and took a deep\nbreath. Your Majesty, I want to impeach\nthe marquee of Changangle Wei Woo for\nspreading heretical and misleading\npeople, disregarding the teachings of\nthe sages and vigorously promoting\nstrange and frivolous skills. This\nscoundrel not only studies unorthodox\nmethods and heretical techniques, but\nalso dares to bewitch the emperor with\nheretical doctrines that bring disaster\nto the country and the people. If such\nan unhealthy trend is imitated by\nstudents all over the world, they will\nabandon the classics and not learn the\nmethods of governing the country and the\nstrategies of governing the world. If\nthis continues, the nation will cease to\nexist. This villain harbors wicked\nintentions and deserves to be punished.\nI implore your majesty to execute this\nvillain to awaken the people. Zhu Yuan\nJang never expected that Imperial Senor\nHuang would stand up and impeach Wei Wu\nat this time and with such sharp words.\nSo he subconsciously glanced at Leon\nChong only to find that the old man also\nlooked surprised looking again at the\nresolute Imperial sensor Huang Zhu Yuan\nJang remained silent for a moment before\nspeaking. Hang Lang. Although sensors\nmay report matters based on hearsay,\ntheir words must be supported by real\nevidence. This matter need not be\nbrought up again. After Zhu Yuan Jang\nfinished speaking, he prepared to\nadjourn the court session. However, at\nthis moment, Imperial Sensor Hang took\nanother step forward. Your Majesty, I,\nyour subject, will remmonstrate even\nunto death. This remmonstrance,\ndelivered with a death sentence,\nprovoked Zhu Yuan Jang&lt;unk&gt;s temper, and\nhe immediately prepared to issue an\norder. However, before he could speak,\nImperial Sensor Hang suddenly took a\nstep forward and crashed head first into\na golden pillar in the main hall. With a\nthud, Imperial Sensor Hang collapsed on\nthe spot, blood flowing all over the\nground. Chapter 145. The Imperial\nMedical Academy. A chance encounter. To\nbe honest, Zhu Yuan Jang really didn't\nexpect that Imperial Sensor Hong would\npull such a stun on him. Even a ruthless\nemperor like him would feel a chill run\ndown his spine if he encountered\nsomething like this. Someone crashing\ninto a pillar in front of the palace.\nIndeed, Zhu Yuan Jang killed many\nofficials and even frequently practice\nthe practice of punishing those who were\nimplicated in others crimes. But that's\nonly if the official is guilty, even if\nit's just a fabricated charge. The key\nis to have a legitimate reason for being\nso so that no one in the world can say\nanything. But the current situation is\ncompletely different. The sensor and\ncivil official have run into a pillar in\nfront of the palace. This is not a good\nthing to handle because this kind of\nthing has too much political impact if\nit gets out that officials advice has\nbeen ignored and they commit suicide by\nhitting a pillar to prove their\ninnocence. What would the people think?\nWould they think the emperor was\nincompetent, unwilling to listen to wise\ncounsel, unable to distinguish right\nfrom wrong, and unable to accept advice?\nMost importantly, those scholars and\nstudents unaware of the truth spread\nrumors and misinformation, causing them\nto fly everywhere. To be honest, at this\npoint, Zhu Yuan Jang was already cursing\nin his heart and cursing in the most\nvulgar way. He desperately wanted to\norder sensor Hang to be dragged out and\nbeheaded. But the problem was he\ncouldn't do that. If the punishment had\nbeen ordered before Imperial sensor Hang\nhit the pillar, the matter wouldn't have\nbeen so troublesome. But Imperial Sensor\nHang didn't utter a word and went\nstraight to the pillar. If he were to\nspeak up and punish him now, it would\ndiscourage all the officials and make\neveryone feel insecure. Not only should\nthey not be punished, but they should\nalso find a way to bring the person\nback. Even if the person is alive, the\nproblem is still troublesome. But if a\nperson dies in this funkian hall, then\nit will be a real problem. Why is it so\ntroublesome? Just think about how few\npeople throughout history have ever done\nthis. Fortunately, Imperial sensor Hang\ndid not die, which is actually normal.\nIt's not easy to die from hitting a\npillar. Several people in history have\nattempted to ram their heads against\npillars, but only two actually died. The\nfrontal bone is one of the hardest bones\nin the human body, and Hang Yushir being\na civil official did not have that much\nstrength. To be fair, Imperial Sensor\nHang did bleed quite a bit, and it\nlooked rather intimidating. Therefore,\neven though Zhu Yuan Jang wanted to\nexecute Imperial Sensor Hong, he still\nhad to save him. Guards immediately send\nImperial Sensor Hang to the Imperial\nphysician for treatment. issue an\nimperial decree that he must be healed\nat all costs. After a brief period of\nchaos, the palace servants carried\nImperial Sensor Hong and hurried towards\nthe Imperial Medical Academy. Zhu Yuan\nJang with a gloomy expression announced\nthe adjournment of the court. Just as\nthe officials were leaving, Weii\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s group arrived at the gate of\nthe Imperial Medical Academy. Led by the\nservant, \"We arrived at the office of\nphysician Sue.\" However, the room was\nquite lively with the imperial\nphysician, the imperial physician\nassistant, and four imperial physicians\nall present. Until Wei Wu entered the\nroom, none of these people noticed him.\nEveryone gathered around a table on\nwhich sat the microscope that we woo had\ngiven to physician Sue. At this moment,\na man from Wei Wu, who had never met the\nImperial physician, was intently looking\nat something under a microscope. Seeing\nthis, we woo could only cough twice in\nan attempt to get their attention.\nCough, cough. Whether they were too\nfocused or had grown accustomed to the\nsound of coughing, these people didn't\nreact at all. To be honest, seeing this\nscene, Wayiu was already a little\nscared. Last time, physician Sue\ninsisted on talking to him for most of\nthe day and wouldn't let him leave. Now,\nthere are even more people. Moreover,\njudging from their expressions, they\nclearly share the same intense curiosity\nabout microorganisms as physician Sue.\nIf they manage to keep you chatting,\nthere might not be enough time in 24\nhours. Thinking about this, we wu\nconsidered whether he should find\nsomeone to call physician Sue out for a\nprivate talk. Before he could make a\ndecision, physician Sue suddenly looked\nup at him. Look, the Earl of Chonglu is\nhere. If you don't understand anything,\njust ask him. Upon hearing physician\nSue's voice, all the Imperial physicians\nsurrounding the microscope turned to\nlook at Wayi Woo. That look in his eyes\nwas like that of a scoundrel who had\nbeen locked up for over a decade, seeing\na beautiful woman in black stockings and\na miniskirt. Immediately afterwards, a\ngroup of people rushed over and\nsurrounded Wayi Woo. Uncle Chong Lu, you\nsaid that the wound became infected\nbecause of these microorganisms, and you\neven gave a method to prevent it. Is\nthat true, Uncle Chonglu? If the\nenvironment is not suitable and the\nwound has become inflamed and suurated,\nhow can it be effectively treated? It's\nmy turn. It's my turn, Uncle Chonglow.\nBesides high temperature, are there any\nother ways to kill microorganisms?\nThe Imperial physicians were all talking\nat once, and they were making Wei Woos\nhead spin. Knowing he could not escape,\nhe had no choice but to raise his voice\nand shout, \"Stop! one at a time where\nI'm turning around and leaving. Upon\nhearing Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s shout, the Imperial\nphysicians immediately fell silent. In\nthat instant, Weii Wu finally understood\nwhy Son Wukong wanted to kill Tangan\nZang. The feeling of peace and\ntranquility in the world was too\nwonderful. After letting his ears have\nsome peace and quiet, Wei Wu pointed to\none of the Imperial physicians. What was\nyour question just now, Lord Chonglu? I\nwould like to ask if there are any other\nmethods besides high temperature to kill\nmicroorganisms.\nYes, and there are several kinds. Wayi\nWu nodded, offering another answer and\nthen continued. First, high temperature\nsterilization is used and second,\nalcohol can be used for sterilization.\nThe so-called alcohol is a high\nconcentration spirit obtained by\nrepeated distillation. The principle is\nthe same as how a drunk person wants to\ndrink water. Alcohol evaporates quickly,\nkilling microorganisms through\ndehydration because most microorganisms\nlike insects prefer warm and humid\nenvironments. This is why there are many\npoisonous insects in the southwest. Oh,\nby the way, the salt we usually eat also\nhas a certain antibacterial and\nanti-inflammatory effect. Just as way\nWoo was about to continue, he discovered\na scene that left him both amused and\nexasperated. Among these Imperial\nphysicians, several were holding pens\nand recording what he said. He couldn't\nhelp but chuckle to himself at his own\npretentious act, but he still continued.\nBesides high temperatures, alcohol and\nsalt, exposure to sunlight, and keeping\nthe environment dry are also effective.\nI don't need to explain the principle,\ndo I? Upon hearing Wu's words, all the\nImperial physicians surrounding him\nnodded in understanding. They weren't\nfools, and a fool couldn't possibly\nbecome the imperial physician who\ntreated the emperor. Seeing that\neveryone nodded, we wu finally spoke up\nto ask a question. So, who else has a\nquestion? I. As soon as we Wu finished\nspeaking, another Imperial physician\nstepped forward and raised his own\nquestion. Uncle Chonglu, if\nmicroorganisms have caused the wound to\nbecome inflamed and surate, how can it\nbe effectively treated? The imperial\nphysician did ask a rather crucial\nquestion. Weii Wu knew something about\nthis, but he was interrupted before he\ncould speak. Imperial physicians,\nsomeone come quickly. Save his person at\nonce. His majesty has decreed that this\nperson must be brought back to life. The\nsound had barely reached them when a\ngroup of palace servants rushed in\ncarrying a person. Upon taking a look,\nWayi Wiu realized it was Imperial Sensor\nHang and couldn't help but tease him out\nof curiosity. What happened to this guy?\nDid he bump into a tree while walking or\nis he hit by a pig? The palace servants\nlooked in the direction of a voice and\ndiscovered that the person making the\njoke was Wei Woo. So they quickly\nreplied. Reporting to the Earl of\nChangangle, Imperial Sensor Hang did not\nhit a tree, but rather rather. We wu\nlooked at him speechlessly. But what?\nTell me what it is. Upon hearing this,\nthe head palace servant didn't hesitate\nand directly explain the matter.\nImperial sensor Hong did not run into a\ntree. Rather, he impeached you before\nhis majesty to no avail and then\ncommitted suicide by running into a\npillar in front of the Hall of\nRepentance. Chapter 146. Is this the\nImperial Hospital or the Palace of the\nKing of Hell? Holy crap. Wayi Wu\noriginally intended to watch the show,\nbut he never expected to become the one\nbeing entertained. What surprised him\neven more was that this guy's surnamed\nHuang would go to such lengths to mess\nwith him. However, seeing the tragic\nblood on Imperial Sensor Hongs face,\nWayi Wu couldn't help but sigh inwardly.\nThis guy's head is bleeding like crazy.\nTo be honest, Wayu wasn't worried at all\nthat this guy could pose any threat to\nhim. Old Ju's whole family were his\nbackers. Zuao alone was enough to\nsuppress those officials. Not to mention\nthat behind Zu Bao, there was Empress\nMa, an insurmountable mountain that no\none could cross. He just couldn't\nunderstand why it was really necessary\nto go to such lengths as to smash one's\nhead against a pillar in front of the\npalace just to impeach him. Just as Wei\nWoo was filled with doubt, the Imperial\nphysicians had already surrounded him to\nexamine him. There was nothing they\ncould do. The emperor had already issued\nan edict, and if someone died, all of\nthem would be held responsible. Only\nphysician Sue stood calmly next to Wayi\nWu, watching the spectacle alongside\nhim. Wayi Wu was somewhat surprised to\nsee him so calm. Old Sue, aren't you\nworried at all? If he dies here, the\nImperial Medical Bureau will be in big\ntrouble. He won't die. The three simple\nwords from physician Sue only fueled Wei\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s curiosity. Are you so sure?\nWhat if he really dies? Dead. So what if\nhe's dead? No one can stop a person from\ndying. To be honest, did you figure\nsomething out? Seeing that way, Woo kept\npressing for answers. Physician Sue\nlowered his voice and whispered. You can\ntell he's fine just by looking at his\nforehead. At most, he'll have a\nconcussion, and when he wakes up, he'll\nexperience dizziness, nausea, and\nvomiting. Weii Wu understood what he\nmeant. In simple terms, it meant a\nconcussion. Seeing the blood on Imperial\nsensor Hangs forehead, Weii Wu couldn't\nhelp but ask another question. He lost\nso much blood. Is it really just a\nconcussion? Upon hearing this, physician\nSue smiled and then explained, \"Do you\nthink there's that much blood inside the\nskull?\" The palace servant just now said\nhe fainted after hitting a pillar in\nfront of the palace. The dragon pillars\nand function hall are not smooth and\nclean. The golden dragon carvings on\nthem are raised. And anyone who bumps\ninto them will bleed. And look at his\nforehead. The skin and flesh are all\ntorn off. It's obviously caused by a\nforeign object. Otherwise, how could he\nhave bled so much? Upon hearing what\nphysician Sue said, Wayi Wu suddenly\nrealized what was going on. However, at\nthis moment, physician Sue added in a\nlow voice, \"And this guy is awake. He\nprobably saw you here and pretended to\nbe unconscious.\" Upon hearing this, when\nwe looked at Imperial Sensor Hong again,\nhis gaze had shifted to one of utter\ncontempt. How stupid would someone have\nto be to pretend to be unconscious in\nfront of doctor, really thinking that\nthe doctor wouldn't be able to tell?\nSubsequently, after a thorough diagnosis\nby the Imperial physicians, they reached\nthe same conclusion as physician Sue had\npredicted. In layman's terms, it's a\nminor abrasion, a rather deep and large\nwound, but it won't kill you. According\nto the normal procedure, Hang Yushir\nshould be given medicine at this time.\nIf the wound doesn't heal well, just\nsuture it up with a bandage. However,\njust as the Imperial physicians were\nabout to take action, someone chimed in\nwith a comment. Do you think his wound\nwill become inflamed, ooze pus, or get\ninfected if it's not treated? The\nImperial physicians who were about to\ntake action all stopped upon hearing\nthis. Looking at the wound on Imperial\nSensor Hongs head, the Imperial\nphysicians exchanged glances as if they\nhad reached some kind of consensus. We\nwas shocked to see them like this. No\nwonder I always heard people talking\nabout slices and slices. It turns out\nthat people who study medicine really\nhave a similar obsession. Then he\nglanced at Imperial Sensor Hong and\nnoticed that the man's eyes were moving\nunder his eyelids. Then a mischievous\nsmile crept across his lips as he said,\n\"Are you planning to use him for\nexperiments?\" Upon hearing Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s\nwords, all the Imperial physicians\nturned to look at him, but none of them\nuttered a word. However, his eyes seemed\nto carry a hint of malice. At this\ncrucial moment, physician Sue, the\nImperial physician, spoke up, \"All\nright, even if you want to test him, you\ncan't take him. His majesty has issued\nan order and this person must not be\nallowed to get into trouble. Upon\nhearing physician Sue's words, Imperial\nSensor Hang, who was lying there,\nfinally stopped rolling his eyes.\nMoreover, Wayi Wu could tell that this\nguy seemed to have breathed a sigh of\nrelief. But then, physician Sue's next\nwords made Imperial Sensor Hang tense up\nagain. However, his wound is quite\nlarge. To prevent it from becoming\ninfected and oozing pus, we should use\nsome anti-inflammatory treatments on\nhim. After hearing what physician Sue\nsaid, all the other physicians around\nhim smiled. That's right. We need to\ndisinfect his wounds to save him. Why\ndon't we go buy some wine and clean his\nwounds? Should I clean the wound with\nalcohol? Upon hearing what the Imperial\nphysician said, Wayi Wu felt as if he\nhad seen a living yama. Low\nconcentration alcohol is not very\neffective. Besides causing pain, it may\nalso slow down wound healing. The key\nissue is that ancient wines and spirits\ndidn't have very good antibacterial\ntechnology. So, they might have\ncontained deadly bacteria. No. No. Uncle\nChonga said it requires high proof\nliquor, but washing it with liquor first\nand then sprinkling salt on it should\nwork, right? Upon hearing this, we wu\ncouldn't help but cover his forehead.\nThen looking at the Imperial physician\nwho had spoken in front of him, he\nsilently apologized to him. I take back\nwhat I just said. You are not the living\nYama. This is the real living Yama.\nHowever, Wayi Wu apologized too soon and\nthen came the real Yama 2.0. Wouldn't it\nbe better if you washed it with alcohol\nfirst, then sprinkled it with salt and\nthen put it in the sun to dry? In fact,\nWayi Wiu knew that these Imperial\nphysicians were deliberately saying this\nto scare Imperial Sensor Hong. After\nall, the palace servants had just\nmentioned that the reason why Imperial\nSensor Hang banged his head against the\npillar in front of the palace was to\nimpeach Chow Chow. Now that both of them\nare here, judging by their relationship,\nthey're definitely on Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s side.\nSeeing the Imperial physicians\ncooperation, Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s playful side\nwas also aroused. I think it's okay,\nalthough it will be very painful. It's\nfor the sake of this sensor, and he\nshouldn't have any objections. Upon\nhearing Weii Wu&lt;unk&gt;s words, Imperial\nSensor Hang knew that if he continued to\npretend, he might suffer. In his tense\nstate, Imperial sensor Hang sat up\nabruptly like a zombie, glaring angrily\nat Wei Wu. Weii Wu, you despicable\nvillain. You actually dare to take\nadvantage of my misfortune and try to\nkick me when I'm down. I will not let\nyou have your way. Oh, Sensor Hong woke\nup just in time. But you say I took\nadvantage of someone in distress. What?\nDoes a sensor have the right to frame\nsomeone so easily? After speaking, Wayi\nWu raised his finger and pointed to the\nImperial physicians around him. Now that\nall the Imperial physicians from the\nImperial Medical Academy are here, if\nyou dare to wrong me, believe me, I'll\ngo and smash my head against a pillar in\nfront of the palace. When he heard Wayi\nWu mock him by mentioning hitting a\npillar in front of the palace, Imperial\nSensor Hangs face immediately darkened.\nSeeing the Imperial physicians around\nhim trying to suppress their laughter,\nhe immediately wanted to retort. But at\nthe crucial moment, physician Sue spoke\nfirst. \"All right, someone take Imperial\nSensor Hang to get treatment lest he\nactually develop some serious illness.\"\nUpon hearing this, Imperial sensor Hang\ndared not press the matter any further\nand immediately left the room with the\nmedical staff. After he left, the\nImperial physicians burst into laughter.\nHowever, after laughing, the Imperial\nphysician who had asked the question\nearlier spoke up again. Lord Chong Lu,\nif the wound has become inflamed and\nsuurated, are there any better and more\neffective treatments? Wayi Wu also put\naway his playful mood and said with a\nserious expression, \"Yes, Allisonin\npenicellin and salicylic acid. Chapter\n147, the three magic anti-inflammatory\ndrugs. Allisonin, penicellin, and\nsalicylic acid. In fact, when the\nImperial physician spoke, Wayi Wu knew\nhe had hit the nail on the head. If we\nwere to rank the diseases that caused\nthe most deaths in ancient times,\ninflammation would definitely be among\nthe top three. Although traditional\nChinese medicine has a variety of\nprescriptions and a wealth of miraculous\nmethods, ultimately however its drugs\nare not targeted at microorganisms such\nas bacteria and viruses. The underlying\ntheory is to use medication to regulate\nthe body, allowing the body to fight off\ndisease on its own. Using cockroaches as\nan analogy, ancient Chinese medicine was\nbased on the cockroach's living habits\nto change the home environment. For\nexample, if you change the damp, dirty,\nand messy environment, the cockroaches\nwill disappear. Modern medicine uses a\nbottle of dicloros to directly poison\nthe target. But this method has limited\neffectiveness. For example, a cold is\nactually an inflammation, an\ninflammation of a nasal cavity or\nthroat, commonly known as an upper\nrespiratory tract infection. For 80% of\nviral colds, humans are actually\nhelpless against them. Medication only\nrelieves physical discomfort. It does\nnot kill pathogens. The body relies on\nits own immune function to heal itself.\nThe remaining 20% are bacterial colds\nwhich can be treated with antibiotics.\nThe human body is powerful but also\nvulnerable. Sometimes even with\ntraditional Chinese medicine treatment\nis impossible to fight all\ninflammations. At this point, modern\nmedicines are needed to compensate for\nthese deficiencies. The three types\nmentioned by Wei Woo all have very good\neffects on inflammation. However, for\nthese Imperial physicians, these three\nmedicines were both familiar and\nunfamiliar. They know what garlic is,\nbut they don't understand it when you\nadd the word vegetarian. They also know\nwhat willow is, but they're confused\nwhen you add the word sour. Finally,\nthey also understood the same principle\nbehind penicellin. Adding a certain\ningredient would render it ineffective.\nJust as the Imperial physicians were\nabout to continue their questioning,\nphysician Sue spoke first. Lord Chonglu,\nare these three medicines you mentioned\nextracted from the substances\nrepresented by their names? That's\nright. Weii Wu nodded, secretly praising\nhim. No wonder he could become the\nImperial physician. His ability to grasp\nthe key points is truly remarkable.\nHaving received Weii Wu&lt;unk&gt;s\naffirmative answer, physician Sue spoke\nagain. Could you please explain the\nintricacies and techniques involved?\nThere is nothing wrong with that. After\ngiving an affirmative answer, we woo\ncontinued. Let me start with salicylic\nacid. The tender branches and bark of\nwillow trees contain a substance called\nsalicylic acid. The simplest way is to\nboil it in water, then filter it to get\na salicylic acid solution, which is\nanalesic and anti-inflammatory effects.\nAs soon as we woo finished speaking,\nphysician Sue immediately nodded and\ntook over the conversation. Indeed, the\nShinom Material Medicica records that\nthe roots, bark, branches, and leaves of\nwillow can all be used as medicine with\neffects of relieving flame, improving\neyesight, clearing heat, and\ndetoxifying. After speaking, physician\nSue looked at Wayi Woo again and asked,\n\"Is Allison also extracted by simply\nboiling garlic and water?\" No. Wayi Wu\nshook his head in denial, then began to\nexplain. Fresh garlic does not contain\nAllison, so it needs to be crushed and\nleft to sit for the time it takes for an\nincense stick to burn. Then water is\nadded and it is placed in a distillation\ncontainer. Dr. Seuss should know\nsomething about brewing, right? That's\nright. It's the same method as\nextracting wine, distillation, and\ncondensation. But it is important to\nnote that the temperature during\ndistillation should not be too high. It\nshould only be about 70% to 75% of the\nboiling point of water. The golden\nliquid obtained through distillation and\ncondensation is allisonin. It is best\ntaken internally, but it can also be\napplied externally. At this point, Wayi\nWu was about to continue talking about\npenicellin, but suddenly remembered two\nvery important questions. By the way,\nAllison doesn't keep for long. At room\ntemperature, its medicinal effect will\ndisappear after 2 hours. However, it\ncould be stored for a long time in a\ncold but not frozen environment, but I\ndon't know the exact time. By the way,\nthe dosage of Allison needs to be\nprecise. It should be taken three times\na day, and the amount each time should\nnot exceed 1 cm. Upon hearing the amount\nwe woo mentioned, the Imperial\nphysicians felt a chill run down their\nspines. Such a small amount would be\ndifficult to control. But at that\nmoment, a single sentence from physician\nSue enlightened them. The dosage is\nsimple. When taking a medicine, just dip\na chopstick in a drop of water, and that\nshould be about the right amount. After\nspeaking, physician Sue looked at Wayi\nWu. Although he didn't say anything, we\nwu understood that he was waiting for\nfurther developments. The production of\npenicellin is more complicated. It\nmainly involves extracting mold from\nmoldy food, and it must be penicyium.\nThen boil a pot of beef soup. Add\ntendons without seasoning. Let it cool\nand solidify in a meat jelly and then\ndivide it into earth and wear bowls.\nThen using a steamed wooden stick, we\nobtained some microbial flora from the\npallet of the mouth and placed them on\nthe meat jelly. Then we collected\npenicyium mold from fruits and other\nfoods and placed these molds on the meat\njelly, leaving it to stand for about 7\ndays. Weii Wu paused for a moment at\nthis point so that the Imperial\nphysicians could record it. He continued\nspeaking only after he felt he had said\nenough. Meat jelly is a nutrient for\ncultivating microorganisms. It can also\nbe made by mixing rice juice with the\njuice from cooking sweet potatoes. Next,\nyou need to prepare the filtering\nmaterials. Put hardwood or fruit shells\ninto a metal container with air holes\nand dry burn them with an open flame.\nOnce it stops smoking, you get charcoal\nwhich is called activated carbon. Grind\nit and air dry to use for filtration.\nAfter pausing for about 10 seconds, we\nwoo continued. Take some cotton in an\nEarththenware pot. Filter the culture\nmedium once with the cotton and then add\nthree times the amount of vegetable oil\nto the earth and wear pot. Stir until\nthe liquid in the earthnware pot forms\nthree layers. The top two layers can be\ndiscarded, leaving only the bottom layer\nof water. Stir the prepared activated\ncarbon powder. Then add a small amount\nof distilled water. Then add acidic\nwater and then alkaline water. Acidic\nwater can be diluted with vinegar. You\ncan verify the ratio yourself. As for\nalkaline water, you can obtain it by\nboiling seaweed to make juice.\nSimilarly, the dosage of this medicine\nis limited each time. About half a chien\nis enough. Oh, by the way, all the\nutensils used must be boiled in boiling\nwater for the time it takes for an\nincense stick to burn. After finally\nexplaining the preparation methods of\nthe three drugs, Wayi Woos throat was\ndry. It's fortunate that he likes time\ntravel novels and specifically follows a\nblogger who talks about these kinds of\nthings. Otherwise, even if he were asked\nto speak, he wouldn't be able to say so\nmuch. However, just when we Wu thought,\neverything was settled and he could ask\nphysician Sue for the medicine. The\nImperial physicians who had been taking\nnotes earlier gathered around again with\ntheir papers. This time, they asked even\nmore detailed questions than before,\nleaving no detail overlooked. They kept\nwe woo talking for over an hour until he\nwas completely drained. After finally\ngetting rid of all these people, we woo\nfinally had time to pull physician\nsuicide. Old Sue, I've said everything I\nneeded to say. The medicine you promised\nto get from me should be ready by now.\nChapter 148. The incident of hitting the\npillar escalates. Public opinion is a\nfearsome thing. Physician Sue had\nactually guessed that we woo had\nprobably come for this reason.\nOtherwise, judging from his escape last\ntime, he probably wouldn't want to come\nto the Imperial Medical Academy.\nTherefore, he showed no surprise at Wei\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s question. Your combined power\npowder is ready, but only 1 month supply\nwill be made for now. Come and get it\nfor me when you have time later. Huh?\nOnly a month? You have to come back\nagain. Upon hearing this, we woo&lt;unk&gt;s\nface immediately turned bitter. Old Sue,\nyou guys have really drained me dry. I'm\ncompletely drained. There's no use in me\ncoming here. Upon hearing this,\nphysician Sue gave Wei Wu a disapproving\nlook. You think this combined strength\npowder is easy to make? The ingredients\nin this stuff aren't even in the\npalace's treasury. I only managed to get\nsome with the help of a friend. He\ndoesn't have much either, and it will\ntake him half a month to get more. Also,\nyour combined strength powder is ready.\nAs for the other things you asked for,\nthey haven't been prepared yet. You'll\nhave to come and pick them up later. Way\nwas taken aback, not expecting that Shan\nLin and the others hadn't even started\nmaking a medicine yet. Seeing the\nexpression on his face, physician Sue\nimmediately spoke. That's medicine for\n12 people. Just making the pills takes\nhalf a month. I won't even mention the\nother medicines. With that,000 lb\nprescription, if 10 pills the size of\nalmonds are taken daily, 12 people will\nget 12,000 pills in 100 days. How about\nI prepare the medicine and send it to\nyour residents? You don't need much.\nJust make 3,000 pills and I'll take care\nof the rest. Upon hearing this, Wayi Wu\nfinally remember how to take the\nthousand gene formula. 100 days, 12\npeople, 10 pills per person per day. And\nit doesn't seem like much until you\ncalculate it. It's already over 10,000.\nOld Sue. Well, for professional matters,\nI think it's better to let professionals\nhandle it. I won't rush you. Just let me\nknow when you're done, and I'll come and\npick it up. Okay. Seeing weii Wu say\nthis, physician Sue stopped talking and\nturned to take out a round litted wooden\nbox from his medicine chest. Here, this\nis your heli powder. Take it twice a\nday, morning and evening, seven chen\neach time. I've already divided it for\nyou. Upon hearing that it was his own,\nWu quickly reached out and took the\nwooden box. Upon opening it, one sees\nrows of dark pills piled up in the\nwooden box, prompting a puzzled look at\nphysician Sue. Old Sue, isn't this thing\ncalled combined strength powder? Why\nisn't it powder? How could someone tell\nyou that everything called loose is\nnecessarily powder? Oh, no, not at all.\nAfter we woo finished speaking,\nphysician Sue pointed to the heli\npowder. The name was just something the\nauthor of the prescription came up with\non the spur of the moment. I will\ncombine the powder with honey to make\npills and set the dosage so that it will\nbe convenient for you to take. Don't\nworry about the other medicines. I'll\nhave them prepared and sent to your\nresidents. In fact, Wayi Wu only asked\nout of curiosity after hearing what\nphysician Sue said. Without saying a\nword, he picked up a piece and stuffed\nit into his mouth, swallowing it without\neven chewing it. The effects of\ntraditional Chinese medicine are\nundeniable, but the taste is indeed hard\nto accept. After swallowing the combined\npowder, I didn't feel anything strange.\nHowever, Wayiu didn't find it strange.\nIt wasn't some kind of elixir or magic\npill, so how could he feel anything so\nquickly? Just as he was about to leave,\nphysician Sue suddenly spoke up. By the\nway, this medicine strengthens the body\nand nourishes the vital energy. After\ntaking it, you will experience a feeling\nof intense heat and arousal at night. It\nwill subside on its own after 3 hours.\nDuring this period, sexual intercourse\nshould be avoided to prevent the loss of\nYang energy and the dissipation of the\nmedicine's effects. Weii Wu, who was\nabout to leave, immediately stopped in\nhis tracks upon hearing these words. She\nturned to look at physician Sue, her\neyes filled with emotions that could\nonly be described as complex. In other\nwords, if I take this medicine, I will\nnever be able to have a great time at\nnight again. I've only been married a\nfew days, and this is forcing me to\nbecome a public figure with my wife in\nbroad daylight. Old Sue, are you even\nhuman? Why didn't you say so earlier?\nYou only spoke up after I'd already\nswallowed you whole. After a long\nsilence, Wu flipped his wrist and took\nout a small blue pill, handing it to\nphysician Sue. Old Sue, I haven't repaid\nyou for the prescription you gave me. I\nobtained this item along with a\nmicroscope, so I'm giving it to you to\ntake. What is this? This substance has\nthe effect of protecting the heart and\nsafeguarding the blood vessels. Upon\nhearing this, physician Sue had no\ndoubts and took it directly, swallowing\nit whole. Just as he wouldn't harm Wayi\nWu, he also firmly believed that we wu\nwouldn't harm him. Only after seeing\nphysician Sue swallow the medicine did\nweigh Wu speak. By the way, this\nmedicine has a little effect. After\ntaking it, an erection and prolonged\nerection will occur within the time it\ntakes for an incense stick to burn. But\nit's all right. The effects of the\nmedicine will only last for 4 hours and\nthen subside on their own. Oh, by the\nway, you must not drink alcohol during\nthis time. In fact, we didn't know how\nlong it could last. Theoretically, it\nshould have lasted 4 to 5 hours.\nHowever, since the ancients had not\ntaken western medicine, the time might\nhave been longer, which is why it was\nsaid to be 4 hours. Seeing the\nastonished expression on physician Sue's\nface, Weii Wu chuckled, turned around,\nand ran out quickly. About 20 minutes\nafter Wei Wu left, Physician Sue's\nexpression became somewhat unnatural. My\nbut is glued to the chair. No matter\nwhat I'm doing, I absolutely refuse to\nstand up. But the intense urge lurking\nwithin his body made his mind wander\nuncontrollably. As a result, when\nwriting the prescription for Imperial\nSensor Hong, one of the ingredients was\nwritten incorrectly. Although it will\nnot affect the efficacy of the medicine,\nit may cause some embarrassing side\neffects. While it calms the mind and\nhelps with sleep, it also has the added\neffect of causing severe diarrhea.\nBecause he was the imperial physician,\nthe medical workers who dispensed the\nmedicine and the servants who prepared\nthe medicine did not pay any attention\nto him. After preparing the herbal\ndecoction according to the prescription,\nI sent it directly to Imperial Sensor\nHong. On the other side, Wayi Wu rushed\nhome after leaving the Imperial Medical\nAcademy. While sitting in a sedan chair,\nfeeling bored, I suddenly heard a jumble\nof conversations coming from outside.\nHave you heard? This morning at court,\nImperial Sensor Hang Lang died,\nremmonstrating with the emperor in the\nmain hall, even ramming his head against\na golden dragon pillar. I heard I heard\nI heard it was to impeach the Earl of\nChangangle and to die to prove his\nintegrity. He was truly a man of\nunwavering integrity and integrity. Do\nyou think that the Earl of Changel is\nreally, as Imperial Senor Hang said,\nresearching unorthodox doctrines to\nmislead the emperor and is a scourge to\nthe country and its people. That's true.\nMy uncle told me that the Earl of\nChangel set up a science and technology\ninstitute and he spends all his time\nresearching strange and ingenious\ntricks. This scourge is a disaster. Your\nmajesty is foolish. Why not execute him?\nKeeping him alive is like raising a\ntiger to cause future trouble, harming\nour great Ming dynasty. Hearing the\ndiscussions outside, Weii Wu&lt;unk&gt;s eyes\nalso darkened. It wasn't because of what\nthese people said, but because he felt\nsomething was a miss about the whole\nthing. It has only been a short time\nsince the incident of Hang Lang hitting\nthe pillar in front of the palace. Yet,\nit has already become common knowledge.\nEither this was meticulously planned or\nsomeone has taken the opportunity to\nstir up trouble and try to ruin his\nreputation. Regardless of which one it\nis, it's certain that they came for him.\nThinking of this, we wu immediately\nlifted the curtain of the sedan chair\nand said to the coachman, \"Don't go\nhome. Take me to the place in the\ncapital with the most tea houses and\ntaverns.\" Upon hearing we woo&lt;unk&gt;s\norder, the groom immediately pulled on\nthe reigns to change direction. Chapter\n149 Old Zu tacitly approves, watching\npublic opinion for a minute. Over the\nnext period of time, Weii Wu toured\nvarious tea houses and taverns in the\ncapital. As he expected, people in tea\nhouses and taverns were talking about it\nextensively. Feian tea house, that\ndamned Academy of Science and Technology\nis a bunch of lowly people who chisel\nwood and dig mud. They don't read the\nbooks of sages and they don't listen to\nthe words of sages. The actions of the\nEarl of Changangle are truly outrageous.\nYai Tavern, Imperial Sensor Hong, is\nupright and honest, embodying the spirit\nof scholars like us. That Earl of\nChangel is truly despicable. By\nestablishing a science and technology\ninstitute, he almost caused our great\nMing to lose a loyal minister. Akazuki\nTea House. The Academy of Science and\nTechnology is going to showcase its\nachievements in 7 days. Let's go\ntogether then and make sure that the\nsource of this scourge of miraculous\ntechnology and that Earl of Chonglu are\nremembered with infamy for eternity.\nLooking around, I saw that these people\nwere all students or scholars of varying\nages and all of them were intellectuals.\nPeople love to join in the fun and they\nare especially interested in the kind of\nexcitement that they don't usually hear\nabout. Not to mention the excitement was\ncoming from the palace which made it\neven more likely to attract people's\nattention. Therefore, when these\nscholars were talking about this matter,\nthere were crowds of onlookers. At this\nmoment, Wayi Wu finally understood why\nZhu Yuan Jang had set rules at the\nbeginning of the dynasty. Everyone was\nallowed to speak frankly except for\nstudents who were not allowed to discuss\npolitics. Those discussing this matter\non the street were mostly ordinary\npeople while those in the tea house were\nmostly scholars. The common people were\ntalking about what imperial sensor Hang\nhad done to court as well as their\ndoubts about Ju Yuan Jang. These\nscholars dared not speak of matters of\nthe imperial court. So they turned their\nattention to the Academy of Sciences and\nits founder. Because they are literate\nand eloquent, they only know how to read\nbooks and have a terrible lack of life\nexperience. Such people are most prone\nto acting impulsively, believing\nwhatever they hear and then they like to\nshow off their knowledge. They not only\nfirmly believe that what they have heard\nis correct, but they also embellish it\nwith their own insights before speaking\nit out. As the saying goes, gossip is a\nfearsome thing. It spreads from one\nperson to 10, from 10 to 100, and\neventually the meaning changes. For\nexample, right now, the scholars in tea\nhouses and taverns are all freely\nexpressing their opinions. The\nsurrounding people were all misled by\nthem, believing that we woo was the\nbiggest cancer in the Ming dynasty.\nWhile these scholars were engaging in\ntheir lofty discussions, the onlookers\neither muttered curses under their\nbreath or loudly echoed their\nsentiments. It's as if Wei Wuin was the\ngreatest scourge of all time and had to\nbe eliminated to ensure the continuation\nof the Ming dynasty. This must be a\npropaganda war unique to ancient times.\nI just wonder who's manipulating it\nbehind the scenes. After leaving the\nlast tea house, Wayi Wu shook his head\nand chuckled softly. Why could we Woo\nstill laugh at this moment? Because he\nwasn't angry from the beginning. To be\nhonest, Weii Wu thought these people's\nmethods of manipulating public opinion\nwere still a bit lacking. Even if you\ndon't compare them to the king of public\nopinion, the Pia Yang, they're better at\nit than any other public account. After\nall, Chow Chow was someone who had\nwitnessed countless shocking events in\nlater generations. So, he had some\nunderstanding of this matter. If those\nbehind him were to attack way Woo using\nhis personal character, then he really\ndidn't have a better way to deal with\nit. Because proving yourself is the\nstupidest thing to do. No matter what\nyou do, you'll only be seen as having\nulterior motives. But the key point of\npublic opinion this time is the Academy\nof Sciences, which is accused of using\nso-called ingenious and harmful\ntechnologies to harm the country and its\npeople. Wayi Woo was implicated only\nbecause he was the founder of the\nAcademy of Sciences. However, it's\nimportant to understand that technology\ncan be clearly demonstrated and is\nundeniable. Once the Academy of Sciences\npresents its findings in 7 days, public\nopinion will immediately reverse. All\nthe doubts and criticisms will\ndisappear. No, not just disappear, but\nturn into praise. Those misled people\nwhen they learn the truth and that the\ntruth is relevant to them. The anger of\nbeing deceived will be transformed into\nrecognition and appreciation for the\nAcademy of Sciences. Therefore, Wayiu\nwas not worried at all and went straight\nback to the carriage to give the driver\norders. Let's go home. Upon hearing\nthis, the coachman immediately pulled\nthe reigns and slowly began to move the\ncarriage. Just as Wei Wu was returning\nhome, Huang Lang received news from the\noutside world through his servants.\nAfter this incident, I Huang am destined\nto go down in history. Haha. It's no\nwonder Hang Lang was so excited. This\nwas something that ancient literati\ncherished most. After all, all the news\nhe received from his servants was praise\nfor him and denigration of Wei Woo from\nthe outside world. The titles he was\ngiven, such as the greatest loyal\nminister of the Ming dynasty and a\nreincarnation of Wei Jang, all tempted\nhim. It should be noted that throughout\nhistory, there have been very few civil\nofficials who committed suicide by\nstriking their heads against pillars in\nfront of the palace to demonstrate their\nloyalty. In fact, there were none during\nthe entire Ming dynasty. So, Hang Lang\ncan be said to have set a precedent\nduring the Hongu era. In his excitement,\nHuang Lang even imagined how future\ngenerations would record his deeds.\nUnfortunately, Hang Lang was unaware\nthat while he was indulging his\nfantasies, Zhu Yuan Jang was also\nindulging in his own fantasies. However,\nwhat Lo was thinking about was how many\npieces he should cut Huang Lang and the\npeople behind him into after the Academy\nof Sciences presented its results. Even\nWei Wu could see that something was a\nmiss with the public opinion this time.\nSo, how could Ju Yuan Jang not see it?\nEven before the court session ended, he\nhad already dispatched a large number of\nImperial guards to secretly investigate\namong the people who were behind the\ntrouble. Of course, Lau also understood\nthat the chances of finding out were\nslim. After all, public opinion is not\nso simple. But there's always a chance.\nIf they really find out, then he can\nraise the butcher's knife. Therefore,\nthey didn't even sparely Shan Chong's\nside and also sent people to investigate\nsecretly. As for why we wait until the\nAcademy of Sciences showcases its\nresults, it's obviously to achieve\nmultiple benefits at once. Olju had\nwitnessed the power of technology\nfirsthand. So, he had great confidence\nin Wei Woo and the Academy of Sciences.\nThis incident can be used to promote the\nreputation of the Academy of Sciences\nand let people all over the world\nunderstand the role and benefits of\nscience and technology. This will make\nit easier when we have to tender for\ncement to build roads in the future. Not\nonly can it reduce resistance from\nofficials, but it also ensures that\nproduct from the Academy of Sciences are\nof high quality. If the Academy of\nSciences develops other good things in\nthe future, it will be easier and more\nconvenient to promote them. He hadn't\nforgotten what we woo had said. The\nAcademy of Science and Technology would\ndefinitely be a golden goose in the\nfuture. Therefore, even if some students\nviolated the rules by discussing\npolitics, he would simply turn a blind\neye. Let this public opinion spread\nfreely. The bigger the commotion, the\ngreater the gains when we are proven\nwrong in the future. Old Ju never does\nbusiness at a loss. With Zhu Yuan Jangs\ntacid approval and the encouragement of\nthose behind the scenes, the matter\nbecame increasingly heated. Meanwhile,\nWeii Wu, a key figure at the center of\npublic opinion, was at home talking with\nJean Hai and others. Indeed, after a\nlong journey, Jean Hai and his men\nfinally brought Lugu back to the\ncapital. It was quite a coincidence.\nThey had just returned when they ran\ninto Wei Wu, who had just come home at\nthe gate. Young master Lu E, the head of\nthe Lu family, is dead. We can only\nbring back his younger brother, Lugu,\nwho knows some things. Chapter 150. The\nsins of the Lou family. Their audacity\nknows no bounds. We mansion. Welcome\nhome. Weii Wu sat in the main seat,\nlooking down at the disheveled and\nexhausted Lugu. After a moment of\nhesitation, he turned to look at Jean\nHai and the other three whose faces were\nweathered and worn. What exactly\nhappened? Why are only the four of you\nback? Where are Shanun Lllin and the\nothers? Reporting to the young master,\nShan has taken seven other brothers to\nYong Joe to investigate the matter you\nentrusted to him. After saying that,\nJean Hai immediately recounted the\nentire process of the operation. Upon\nhearing that the two men had taken a\npiece of paper from Lu Yi's stomach on\nwhich some words were written, Wayi Wu\ncouldn't help but frown. It wasn't\nbecause of the two people's behavior,\nbut because the note caught his\nattention.\nThere's not much that can be gleaned\nfrom just these eight characters. Yang\nJoe and Songba are already confirmed, so\nthere's no need to rack our brains to\nguess anymore. The key is the last four\ncharacters. The two characters wait jur\nseem to be a certain idiom, but there's\nno way to deduce it. There are countless\nwords and phrases in ancient times that\ncan use the characters wager. Was it\ndone intentionally out of self-interest\nor out of necessity? Moreover, this is\nthe concluding sentence which should\ndraw a conclusion on certain matters,\nbut it is not particularly important.\nThe truly important words should be dong\nand yao. Just from these two characters\nalone, you really can't guess much\ninformation. Take the character dome for\nexample. It could refer to a direction,\na place name, or even considering Lu\nYi's situation, it could be interpreted\nas a comeback. Unable to think of any\nclues for the time being, Wayi Wu could\nonly turn his gaze to Lugu. Lugu, right?\nI don't want to waste my breath on you.\nI'll just tell you everything you know.\nUpon hearing Wu call his name, the\nexhausted Lugu finally raised his head.\nLord Chonglu, I dare not conceal the\ntruth, but I hope that after I tell you.\nLord Chong look and protect my safety.\nAfter Lugu finished speaking, Wayi Wu\nwas so angry that he laughed on the\nspot. Peaceful.\nAre you out of your mind? Don't you know\nwhat your Lou clan has done? If we\nreally want to investigate this, it\nwouldn't be an exaggeration to wipe out\nyour entire Lou family and exterminate\nyour nine generations of relatives.\nRight now, it's just that your whole\nfamily has died. If I were you, I would\nbe burning incense and thanking the\nancestors and gods for their protection.\nHow could you still be thinking about\nasking for peace? At this point, Wayi\nWoos tone suddenly turned cold. I'm\ntelling you, if you tell me, I can't\nguarantee your safety, but if you don't\ntell me, I guarantee you won't be safe.\nFive breaths. If you don't talk, we'll\nsend you straight to the Imperial Guard\nPrison. They have plenty of ways to make\nyou talk. 1 2 4. Lugu, who was still\nhesitating, immediately lost his\ncomposure when he heard Wayi Wu skip to\nfour without even counting to three.\nTell me, tell me. I'll tell you anything\nyou want to know. At this time, the\nreputation of the embroidered uniform\nguard was not very great, and the\nImperial prison was not as terrifying as\nit would become later. But Lugu himself\nwas not a tough guy with a strong will.\nAnd he also understood what kind of\nperson he was. To put it bluntly, he was\njust a fat, bloated gentry from Jang\nNan. Although he hadn't experienced the\nmethods used in prison, it didn't mean\nhe was unaware of them. Rather than\nbeing tortured to the point of wishing\nfor death, it's better to seek a quick\nend. Wayiw smiled dismissively at Lugu's\nreply. Tell us all the dirty deeds your\nLou family has done. Small pox, the\nwhite lotus rebellion. Leaf foam in your\nconnection with Sufu. Small pox white\nlotus sect. Leaf foam. With each word\nWei Wu uttered, Lugu&lt;unk&gt;s expression\ngrew more terrified. He could understand\nwhy Wei Wu knew about these extremely\nsecretive things. However, when we Wu\nmentioned Sufu, a hint of surprise\nflashed in Lugu's eyes. Weii Wu happened\nto notice this hint of surprise and\nimmediately sighed inwardly. The\nexpression a person shows in a split\nsecond is the most genuine and it's\nlikely that Lugu truly didn't know these\nthings. Then there are only two\npossibilities. Either the Lou family\nreally had no connection with Sufu but\nwas just colluding with the White Lotus\nsect. Either Lu E is too good at hiding\nthings and even his own younger brother\ndoesn't know about them. Just as Wei Wu\nwas deep in thought, Lu also spoke up.\nLord Chonglu, what you said about our Lu\nfamily and Sufu. All right, just tell me\nwhat you know. First, tell me about\nSmallox and why you did it. Before Lu\nGuu could finish speaking, Wayi Wu\ninterrupted him. Now that he was at the\nmercy of others, Lu dared not hide\nanything and honestly spoke up. The\nsmallox incident was indeed caused by\nour Lou family. My elder brother and I\nhave argued about it more than once. At\nthis point, Lugu's eyes were filled with\nresentment, but in the end, he could\nonly let out a long sigh. We are already\nrelatives of the royal family, and our\nfamily is extremely wealthy, yet he\nstill insists on risking the lives of\nhis entire family. He wasn't like this\nbefore. Ever since he went on a long\ntrip a few years ago, he's been like a\ncompletely different person. Not only\ndid they scheme against the royal\nfamily, but they also associated with\nthose sorcerers from the White Lotus\nsect, and they wouldn't listen to any of\nmy advice. Upon hearing this, we\nwoo&lt;unk&gt;s eyes narrowed sharply, and he\nimmediately interrupted. Wait, you just\nsaid that he went on a long trip a few\nyears ago and came back different. What\nexactly was that year and on what day?\nLugu frowned and thought for a moment\nbefore giving his answer. Four years\nago, I only remember it was not long\nafter the Dragon Boat Festival. Upon\nhearing this, Wayi Wu frowned and\nlowered his head in deep thought. It is\nnow the 15th year of Hong Wu&lt;unk&gt;s\nreign, and four years ago, it was the\n11th year of Hong Wu&lt;unk&gt;s reign. It\nseems that Crown Princess Chong gave\nbirth to Zhu Yun Wan in November of that\nyear, and then passed away less than 10\ndays later. In May of the 11th year of\nthe Hong Wu reign, Lu returned home and\nhis personality changed drastically.\nHalf a year later, the Crown Princess\nChong passed away. Subsequently, the\nCrown Princess Lu was promoted to the\nrank of Empress and Alu family\nofficially rose to prominence. It was\ntoo much of a coincidence. Could it be\nthat after the Xianging incident, even\nChang's death was inextricably linked to\nLu? Just as wayu was frowning in\nthought, Lugu, for some reason slowly\nlowered his head. It has to be said that\nLugu is just like his brother Lu E said,\na cowardly and foolish person. He\nlowered his head, trying to hide\nsomething, thinking he was being\ndiscreet, but he forgot that there were\nfour people standing next to him. When\nthese four men brought him back, they\nrevealed their identities as Imperial\nguards. Although Weii wouldn't notice\nhis expression, Jang Hai and the others\nbeside him kept staring at Lugu. Making\nthese small moves right under the noses\nof the embroidered uniform guard was as\nconspicuous as a beacon in the darkness.\nSo before Wei Wu could react, Jean Hai\nstepped forward and grabbed Lu by the\ncollar. Then he took a short dagger from\na teammate and held the blade to\nLugu&lt;unk&gt;s eyelids. You dare to play\ntricks on our young master? If you don't\nbehave, I'll gouge your eyes out so you\ncan see for yourself. Upon hearing Jean\nHai's voice, Wayi Wu finally snapped out\nof his days. Seeing the terrified look\non Lu's face, his gaze also darkened.\nThe Lu family, how dare you tell me, how\nexactly did you kill Crown Princess\nChong? Chapter 151. A single sentence\nawakens the dreamer. Yang Joe Song by\nTower. the landlord. Upon hearing Weii\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s loud shout, Lugu was so\nfrightened that his whole body trembled.\nIf Jean Hai hadn't been quick-witted and\nagile, the knife tip would probably be\nstuck in his eyeball by now. However,\nLugus's reaction and expression proved\nthat Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s guess was correct.\nThat is indeed the case. Startled by Wei\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s shout, Lugu knew he couldn't\nhide it any longer, so he immediately\nspoke up. Wonglu, please calm down. W\nChonglu, please calm down. That matter\nconcerning the Chong family has nothing\nto do with me. I only found out about it\nlater. Upon hearing this, Wayi Wu\ngrabbed the teacup on the table and\nthrew it over without saying a word. As\na result, because I lost the ball too\nquickly, I didn't control the accuracy\nwell and the direction deviated quite a\nbit. Fortunately, Lugu was being held by\nJean Hai. Seeing that the teacup was\nslightly tilted, Jean Hai grabbed\nLugus's head and shoved it towards him.\nBang. As the porcelain shattered, a\nshard also cut a bloody gash on Lugu's\nhead. I'm asking you a question, not\nasking you to make excuses. If you keep\nspouting useless nonsense, I'll throw\nthe teapot next time. Tell me, seeing\nthe expression on Wei Woos face, Lugu\ndidn't even dare to wipe the blood away\nand quickly said, \"Yes, it's a medicine\nthat my elder brother obtained from the\nWhite Lotus sect. If a woman drinks it\nafter giving birth, she will experience\nuncontrollable bleeding because a normal\nwoman will bleed for more than 10 days\nafter giving birth. This medicine will\nonly make the bleeding more noticeable.\nThe bleeding during childbirth is to\nexpel impurities such as amniotic fluid\nfrom the body. But this medicine is\nactually expelling the essence and\nblood. After listening, Wayi Wu\nimmediately guessed the general\nsituation. Normally after giving birth,\na woman will experience Loki a discharge\nfor a period of time. The Louu family\ntook advantage of this to kill the crown\nprincess Chong without anyone noticing\nand without arousing suspicion. In\nancient times, midwives were responsible\nfor childbirth. Midwives who had been\ndelivering babies for many years\nnaturally knew very well that Lokia\nwould be discharged after childbirth.\nShe was unaware that Lady Chong had been\ndrugged and she didn't believe anyone\nwould dare to harm the crown princess.\nNaturally, they didn't think much of it\nand simply regarded the flowing blood as\nnormal lokia. Child birth is a very\ntaxing experience for women and it is\nalso the time when their bodies are at\ntheir weakest. Even if not properly\ncared for, it can leave lifelong health\nproblems, not to mention the continuous\nbleeding. Given the severe depletion of\nher vital energy and a massive blood\nloss, it's remarkable that Chong Sh\nsurvived for more than 10 days before\ndying, she was already considered to be\nin good health. Unfortunately, even the\nbest physical health cannot protect\nagainst the wickedness of a person's\nheart. Moreover, this method can\nperfectly deceive everyone. Even the\nruthless Zhu Yuan Jang and the seemingly\ninnocent but actually cunning Zhu Bao\nwere completely unaware of this. After\nall, no matter how powerful they are,\nthey are not gods, and there are no\ndoubts or logical inconsistencies. They\ncouldn't possibly doubt the cause of\nChang's death, knowing that in ancient\ntimes, giving birth was like walking\nthrough the gates of hell. To be honest,\nat this moment, even Wu had to admire\nthe audacity of the Lu clan. They\nactually dare to pull off such a grand\nscheme right under Zhu Yu and Jangs\nnose. The key point is that Zhu Xiong\nIng and Lady Chong were both killed by\nthem. So the death of Crown Prince Yuba\nis also questionable. With Lady Lu as\nthe crown princess in the Eastern\nPalace, it was almost inevitable that\nZhu Yun Wan would be deposed. In this\nsituation, Zhu Yunwin has the best\nchance. So naturally, he doesn't need to\nrisk taking action against Crown Prince\nXuao. However, if Zhu Bao has other\nideas or dislikes Xu Yun, then a way\nmust be found to win him over. Of\ncourse, all of this is still happening\nand is merely Weii Wu&lt;unk&gt;s personal\nspeculation, so it cannot be considered\ntrue. To be honest, even he himself\ncouldn't believe his own guess. A mere\ngentry family from Jang dared to set\ntheir sights on the imperial family,\nespecially an emperor like Zhu Yuan\nJang. In Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s view, there were\nonly two possibilities. Either the head\nof the Lou family had gone mad or had\nlost his mind. Or perhaps there are\nother hidden forces behind this and\nsomeone is supporting the Lou family in\ndoing this. The White Lotus Act is\ndefinitely out of the question. Such a\npsychopathic organization doesn't have\nthe vision to undertake such a noble\ncause. But if it were the Confucious\nfamily, they would not only have this\nkind of background, but also the\nnecessary conditions. However, the Kong\nfamily was not like a small family like\nthe Louu family. It was a family of\nsages with a history of thousands of\nyears. Even with solid evidence, Zhu\nYuan Jang couldn't easily take action\nagainst them. Without evidence, it was\neven less likely. At this moment, Wayi\nWu suddenly remembered the conversation\nhe had with Zhu Bao last time. At that\ntime, Zhu Bao suspected that there were\none or two more hidden forces behind the\nLou family, and he probably already\nsuspected the Kong family. However,\nbased solely on suspicion and\nconjecture, he couldn't possibly tell me\nthe truth openly. Thinking of this, Wayi\nWu recalled the contents of the note and\nlooked at Lugu. Jean Hai told me that\nyou told him about Lu E swallowing the\nnote, and he explained the details. Upon\nhearing this, Lugu dared not conceal\nanything and immediately recounted the\nevents of that time. After listening,\nWayi Wu grasped the key point and then\nasked a question. You said that Lu E\nsent someone to summon you to the study\nand that you found that note in the\nstudy and swallowed it. During this\nprocess, did he do anything strange such\nas groping around in the room? Actually,\nthe question that we woo thought of was\nalso influenced by later TV dramas. In\nthose period dramas, there are always\nsome secret passages or hidden passages.\nThe Lou family was already in a life\nordeath crisis. Yet, Lou E still\nsummoned Lugu to his study. This\nbehavior was highly unusual. And even\nmore unusual was that he put on a show\nof secretly swallowing a note in front\nof Lugu. If you're going to steal it\nsecretly, why call Lugu over in the\nfirst place? That's insane. He would\nonly send someone to call his younger\nbrother Lugu if there was something in\nhis study that could save his life. But\nthen something unexpected went wrong and\nthey found that note again. Left with no\nother choice, he swallowed the note and\nthen led Lugu away from the study. It\nmust be said that living in an era of\ninformation explosion has many\nadvantages. Based solely on Lugu's\nwords, Wayi Wu was able to deduce the\ntruth of the matter with remarkable\naccuracy. Lugu's subsequent answer\nconfirmed Weii Woos suspicions. At that\ntime, the study was dark, so I couldn't\nsee very clearly. I only saw my older\nbrother squatting in one place for a\nlong time without moving. Typical. Upon\nhearing Lugu's answer, the word\nimmediately came to Wayi Wu&lt;unk&gt;s mind.\nLugu knew about the White Lotus sect,\nbut he was unaware that there was a\nsecret passage in the study.\nUndoubtedly, besides the White Lotus\nsect, there is an even deeper mastermind\nbehind Lu E. If we want to find a\nmastermind behind this, we probably have\nto look for clues from that note. Yong\nSong Dong Ya, what exactly do Dong and\nYao mean? As Wayi Wu was pondering this,\na servant's voice came from outside the\nhall. Sir, a young lady has come looking\nfor you. She says she's from the High\nChow Shang building. Bring her in. The\ngirls who came from the Beehive Chowing\nbuilding were either Yin Hong or a\nChinglu. Sure enough, not long after,\nYin Hong, wearing black stockings,\nswayed into the hall. Boss, manager\nHuang has sold out his goods and asked\nme to come and get some more to deliver\nto you. As soon as Yan Hong finished\nspeaking, a sudden inspiration flashed\nin Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s mind. The employer boss\nYanja Sana Dongja. Chapter 152. Zhu Bao\nXiao Wu, your brother really, really\nwants to kill them all to exterminate\ntheir entire family. To be honest, Wayi\nWu wasn't sure if his guess was right,\nbut considering the preceding words, it\nwas highly likely. If Dong refers to the\nowner, then the Yao character that\nfollows is most likely a person's name.\none should act accordingly. Lu he tried\nto escape through the tunnel but failed\nand was left with a note. This note\ncannot be seen by Lu Guu, not even by\nhis own younger brother. That could only\nbe the deepest secret hidden in Lu Yi's\nheart. A secret that absolutely could\nnot be known by anyone. Therefore, if\nyou do it, you must do it well. Writing\ndown an address and a person's name and\ntelling him to be careful is undoubtedly\na threat. It is now almost certain that\nthere is a secret passage in Lui's study\nbecause only this makes sense. Thinking\nof this, Wayi Wu immediately turned to\nlook at Yin Hong. Yin Hong, go outside\nand wait for a while. I'll give it to\nyou once I finished dealing with things\nhere. Upon hearing this, Yin Hong\nnodded, turned, and walked out of the\nhall. At this moment, Wayi Wu spoke to\nJean Hai. The note should read, \"Owner\nof Sombila restaurant in Yong Joe. Yao\nis the owner&lt;unk&gt;'s name, and it ends\nwith, \"Take care of yourself.\" Of\ncourse, this is just my guess. I'll have\nthe embroidered uniform guard send a\nmessage to YongJo later and have Shan\nLin check if it's true. We originally\nplanned to send Jean Hai on another trip\nto Sujo to investigate the tunnel and Lu\nYi study. But then I thought about it\nagain and even Lu E couldn't get in back\nthen. So the tunnel had probably been\ncleared away long ago. Even if we\ninvestigate now, we won't find anything.\nSince he didn't have many people around\nhim, he simply kept Jang Hai and the\nother three with him handle their\naffairs. Upon receiving Weii Wu&lt;unk&gt;s\norder, Jean Hai immediately dispatched a\nteam member to the embroidered uniform\nguard. Then we Wu pointed at Lu and\nsaid, \"Take him with us. We're going to\nthe East Palace.\" \"The Eastern Palace?\"\nUpon hearing we mention the Eastern\nPalace, Lugu's face immediately turned\ndeathly pale. All the things he just\nsaid were part of a conspiracy targeting\nthe crown prince. Knowing he was doomed,\nLugu only wanted Wei Wu to give him a\nquick death so he could avoid endless\ntorment. If I were sent to the Eastern\nPalace now, it's almost certain that I\nwould suffer a fate worse than death.\nUpon imagining that scene, Lugu\nimmediately looked at Wayi Wu and\nshouted loudly, \"Lord Chonglu, you\npromised to give me a quick death. I\nsaid that. I don't remember saying\nthat.\" Weii Wu stared at Lu Goo\nspeechlessly while the latter was\ncompletely stunned because he just\nremembered that we woo had indeed never\nsaid it and he himself had never asked\nfor it. He was just thinking that he\nwould tell we woo everything he knew in\norder to get a quick and painless end to\nhis life. The problem was that before he\ncould even speak Wu's one two first\nsilenced him. Danghai. Just as Lugu was\nin a daysaze, he suddenly heard Wu&lt;unk&gt;s\nvoice. I thought there was a chance for\nthings to turn around, but the next\nsecond, I felt a large hand grab my\nneck. Then everything went black and he\nlost consciousness. When Lugu woke up\nagain, he found that his mouth had been\ngagged. The surrounding environment also\nchanged from a normal hall to a\nmagnificent palace. Weii Wu and a\ndignified and reserved young man were\nchatting not far away. The young man was\nlooking at him with eyes full of hatred,\nas if he wanted to devour him alive.\nNext, Lugu only saw the young man's eyes\nflicker before he fainted again. On the\nother side, after Zhu Bao had Lugu\nknocked unconscious, he turned to look\nat Wayi Wu, and the anger in his eyes\nvanished instantly. It seems my previous\nguess was correct. But if the Kong\nfamily of Tsufu really has a hand in\nthis matter, then it will be a bit\ntroublesome. Our great Ming dynasty has\nonly been established for a little over\n10 years. Even if we have solid\nevidence, we cannot easily take action\nagainst the Kong family. Sufu is a\nsacred place in the hearts of scholars\nall over the world. Killing them would\ncause too much turmoil and might even be\nexploited by those with ulterior\nmotives. When Zhu Bao spoke, neither his\ntone nor his attitude showed any\nemotional fluctuation. He appeared very\ncalm. It was the same when he brought\nLugu Gang here. After listening to his\nspeculation and what Lu said, Zhu Bao\nremained calm, as if nothing had\nhappened. But Wei Wu could clearly sense\nthat the killing intent within him was\nlike a super volcano about to erupt. It\nwas only because he forcibly suppressed\nit that the world destroying power was\nnot unleashed. It perfectly portrays the\nemperor's ability to conceal his\nemotions. To be honest, seeing Zhu Bao\nlike this, Wayi Wu even sighed deeply in\nhis heart. Despite being filled with\nanger and hatred, she had to suppress\nher emotions because of her status.\nDespite holding power, he had to\nsuppress his grudges and not seek\nrevenge on his enemies because of the\nbigger picture. However, just as we Wu\nwas thinking this, Zhu Bao suddenly\nblurted out a sentence. Shiao Wu, your\nbrother can't act recklessly, but your\nbrother really, really wants to kill\nthem all to exterminate their entire\nfamily. Upon hearing this, Wayi Wu was\nstunned for a long time before he slowly\ncame to his senses. He could understand\nhow Zhu Bao could speak with such a calm\ntone while uttering such murderous\nwords. However, this also shows that Zhu\nBao's anger is now truly at its limit.\nOtherwise, he wouldn't have spoken his\nmind and tried to find a solution from\nwithin himself. Indeed, after hearing\nwhat Zhu Bao said, Wayiu immediately\nunderstood what he meant. If you want to\ntake action against the Kong family, no\nmatter how you arrange or plan it, you\nwill always leave some clues. Sufu was\nalmost entirely controlled by the\nConfucious family. It wouldn't be an\nexaggeration to call it a state within a\nstate. To deal with them, you need\nplenty of manpower. Otherwise, taking\naction would just be suicide. The\nproblem is that any secret matter once a\nlarge number of people are involved will\ninevitably be lost. If word got out that\nthe Imperial family was secretly\neliminating the family of the sage, the\nMing dynasty would be in real danger.\nThat's why Zhu Bao pinned his hopes on\nhimself and try to find unconventional\nsolutions. Did We Woo have any\nsolutions? To be honest, he did have\none, albeit not a very mature one.\nWeiwood already pondered this issue when\nhe first guessed that it involved the\nKong family. How can I wipe out the Kong\nfamily without getting involved myself?\nAt first, he had no clue what to do\nuntil he met Wong Gang, which gave him\nsome inspiration. Looking at Zu Bao's\ncalm face, Wayi Wu pondered for a moment\nbefore slowly speaking. Brother, I\nunderstand your concerns. As a\nlegitimate ruler of the world, our great\nMing dynasty cannot get involved in such\nmatters. But just because we can't do it\ndoesn't mean others can't. Some people\ndo this not only in a reasonable way,\nbut also without any connection to the\nimperial court. After listening to Wayi\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s words, a hint of doubt flashed\nin Juba&lt;unk&gt;s eyes, but he quickly\nrealized something. And the way he\nlooked at wei Wu became strange. After\nhesitating for a while, he slowly opened\nhis mouth and tentatively asked a\nquestion. Shiao Wu. Those people you\nmentioned, could they be from the White\nLotus Sect? Chapter 153. Destroying\nConfucious. A plan to use one wolf to\ndevour another. That's right. I'm\ntalking about the White Lotus sect. As\nsoon as Zu Bao finished speaking, Wayi\nWu immediately nodded an affirmation and\nthen added, \"Brother, the White Lotus\nsect rebelled against the Yuan Dynasty\nand sought to restore the Song Dynasty\nduring the Yuan Dynasty. And now they're\nusing the banner of rebelling against\nthe Ming dynasty and restoring the Yuan\ndynasty in our great Ming dynasty. This\nis a group of true rebels. Rebels wiped\nout the Confucious family. So scholars\nall over the world naturally hate\nrebels. At most, people will blame the\ncourt for not eliminating the rebels in\nadvance. No one will think that this\nmatter has anything to do with the\ncourt. After listening to Wei Wu's plan,\nZhuao did not agree, but instead\nfrowned. This method seems flawless, but\nit is actually difficult to implement.\nYou also said that they are rebels and\nwill not be manipulated by the court.\nSecondly, attacking the Confucious\nfamily and Sufu would bring them no\nbenefit whatsoever. It would be risky\nand would also leave them with a bad\nreputation. No matter what kind of\norganization it is or what banner it\nflies, in the final analysis, they all\nwant to overthrow the imperial power and\ntake its place. If the White Lotus sect\nattacks the Kong family, they will be\ncondemned by the whole world. Even if\nthey conquer the country, they will not\nbe able to sit on the throne. At this\npoint, Zhu Bao couldn't help but sigh.\nThis is also why rulers throughout\nhistory have treated the Confucious\nfamily with respect because they\nrepresent all the scholars in the world.\nIn the second year of Hong Wu, my father\nissued an edict that the spring and\nautumn sacrifices at the Confucious\nTemple should only be performed in Sufu\nand that the sacrifices should not be\nperformed throughout the country. People\nall over the country thought that my\nfather was targeting the Confucious\nfamily. But who knows that it was\nactually the Kong family who were rude\nfirst. Back when the world was not yet\nsettled and the Ming dynasty had not yet\nbeen established, my father went to Sufu\nalone. Upon hearing this, Wayi Wu looked\nsurprised and couldn't help but ask a\nquestion. Old Master Zhu once went to\nTufu alone to see the Confucious family.\nWhy have I never heard of this in later\nhistorical records? As soon as we Wu\nfinished speaking, a flash of anger\nappeared in Juba&lt;unk&gt;s eyes. Because\nthey humiliated him, father wanting to\nsave face suppressed the matter. Among\nall the officials, only the late marquee\nofQing knew about it. father had hoped\nto gain the support of the Kong family,\nbut that Kong family member didn't even\nopen the door, leaving only the\nquestion, \"Are you an emperor?\" My\nfather understood that the Kong family\nlooked down on his background, but he\ndid not hold a grudge because of it.\nAfter all, he was originally from a\npeasant family. Moreover, the world was\nnot yet settled at that time, and my\nfather was indeed not an emperor, so it\nwas reasonable for people not to want to\nsee him. At this point, Zhu Bao picked\nup the teacup on the table, took a small\nsip, and continued. What truly angered\nmy father was that even though the Ming\ndynasty had been established, not a\nsingle member of the Kong family\nattended the founding ceremony. My\nfather believed that they did not\nrecognize the Zu family's rule. So, he\nissued an edict ordering the current\nDuke, Yin Shan, to come to the capital\nto see him. But the other party claimed\nto be ill and did not come. In the end,\nthey only sent a junior member of the\nfamily, which completely enraged my\nfather. So, he issued that edict. Upon\nhearing this, Wayi Wu nodded secretly,\nadmitting that this was indeed in line\nwith Zhu Yuan Jang&lt;unk&gt;s temperament.\nThe title of Duke Yin sound impressive,\nbut if you really count it, this family\nhas been traitors to the Han people for\nover a dozen rounds. Given Ju Yuan\nJong&lt;unk&gt;s pragmatic personality, he\nwould not have had a good impression of\nfamilies that recited Sage's words and\nwrote surrender documents. He has\nalready shown leniency twice, which is\nonly because of the ancestor of the\nConfucious family. Not only did the\nother party refuse, but they also\nhumiliated him repeatedly. Since that\nwas the case, he might as well just shut\nup. As the ruler of the world, although\nhe could not destroy the Kong family, it\nwould be very easy for him to suppress\nthem. For example, the imperial edict\nthat Zhu Bao mentioned and the fact that\napart from the Duke Yen, no one in the\nKong family could obtain an official\nposition. For thousands of years, the\nConfucious family has been treated as\nhonored guests by emperors, but now they\nare not only not treated with courtesy,\nbut are also being targeted and\nsuppressed. Naturally, they hoped to\nreplace the emperor with one who\nwouldn't target them. But the Ming\ndynasty had already established itself,\nand it was impossible to overthrow it.\nSo, the only option was to target its\nsuccessors. If this is taken as the\nconclusion, then it makes perfect sense\nthat they instigated the Lu family to\ntarget Zu Xiang Ying. The Lou family was\na gentry family and a descendant of the\nfamily happened to become a concubine of\nthe crown prince. What excellent\nconditions they had. Having reached this\nconclusion in his mind, Wayi Wu became\neven more determined to destroy the Kong\nfamily. He was originally on the same\nside as the Zhu family and he also had\nno good feelings towards the family.\nBefore his time travel, we would had\nseen a piece of news about the Kong\nfamily. It is said that during the war\nof resistance against Japan, the Kong\nfamily even submitted a letter of\nsurrender to the Japanese. Although it's\nunknown whether it's true or not, given\ntheir glorious history, the possibility\nis probably not low. In that case,\nthere's even less reason for this family\nto remain. So, after Zhu Bao finished\nspeaking, Wayi Wu immediately gave his\nown plan. Brother, I admit you're right.\nAnyone who wants to contend for the\nworld will never provoke the Kong\nfamily. But you've overlooked a crucial\npoint. The White Lotus sect isn't an\narmy. Their method of expanding their\npower is through bewitchment. They use\nsuperstitious tricks to bewitch the\nignorant lower classes while the truly\nawake ones are a small group of people\nin the upper class. At this point, a\nplayful smile suddenly appeared on Wei\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s lips. They can play tricks, and\nso can we. It's just a matter of who has\nthe better methods. Upon hearing Wei\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s words, Zuao immediately thought\nof what had happened before. You mean\nthe same method you used to toy with\nWong Gang in the Imperial Guar Prison?\nThat's right. Weu nodded, then continued\nspeaking. As far as I know, the current\nleader of the White Lotus sect, the\nWhite Lotus Tauist, is elusive and never\nreveals his true god to his followers.\nBut all instructions were relayed\nthrough the four Dharma kings. His\nmysterious approach gave us a lot of\nroom to maneuver. The believers below\nhave been brainwashed, but the higherups\nare clear-headed. They know exactly\nwhat's going on. If we can capture one\nof the Dharma kings alive and control\nhim, we can then control a large number\nof his followers. As Wayi Wu finished\nspeaking, Zhu Bao chimed in. So, you set\nyour sights on that Chingyong Dharma\nKing at the Lotus Temple in Renong.\nThat's right. He's the only one who\nknows his exact whereabouts, so we have\nno choice but to target him. Upon\nhearing Weii Wu&lt;unk&gt;s answer, Zhu Bao\ndid not immediately nod, but instead\nfrowned and pondered for a long time\nbefore asking, \"Shia Wu, do you want to\ndo this yourself?\" In fact, Zhua had\nalso considered the issue of Wei Wu\nduring this period. He was unwilling to\nlet We Woo take any risks, both from a\nnational and personal standpoint. Even\nif we woo could help him avenge himself\nby going out this time, he still didn't\nwant Wei Woo to take the risk. But\nJuubao knew even more clearly that this\nkind of protection seemed harmless in\nthe short term. However, if this goes on\nfor too long, it may have the opposite\neffect. He didn't want to protect Weii\nWu's safety, but it was unfair to Wei\nWu. Over time, this protection might\ngive Wayi Wu the feeling of being under\nhouse arrest. Good intentions could turn\ninto bad results. So, Zhua has been\nconsidering this. find a way to prevent\nWei Woo from feeling like he is confined\nto the capital. For the time being, the\nonly option he could think of was to\nhave Wei Woo leave the capital and go on\na long trip. However, it should be a way\nto broaden one's horizons through study\ntours rather than this dangerous\napproach. Chapter 154. Zu Yuan Jang. Our\nson-in-law will avenge the Kong family.\nAs for Wei Woo, does he want to go out?\nTo be honest, he really wanted to go out\nand see other places. He did feel\nrestricted during this period, but not\nbecause of Lao Zu's protection. Rather,\nit was because he had been finding the\nroutine of going back and forth between\nthe science institute and home rather\nmonotonous. Having been in the Ming\ndynasty for over a year, I didn't have\nthe opportunity before, but now that I\ndo, of course, I want to go out and see\nthe world. If one were to be trapped in\nthe capital city for the rest of their\nlife, wouldn't that be a complete waste\nof this extraordinary timetraveling\nadventure? Of course, this is only a\nvery small part of the reason. The real\nreason was that he also wanted to\ndestroy the Kong family. He had\npreviously considered ways to deal with\nthe Kong family, but those ideas\nremained only in his mind. But now he\nwants to put it into practice, not for\nLau, but for himself. For this era, the\nexistence of the Confucian family would\nonly have a negative impact on progress.\nIt is not wrong to learn from the\nthoughts of sages. But the purpose of\nlearning is to improve one's morality,\nethics, and personal character. But\nnowadays, most, if not all, scholars use\nthe words of sages to pursue their own\nselfish interests. The words of sages\nare golden truths, and everyone must\nunconditionally believe in and obey\nthem. Otherwise, they are heretics. The\nkey point is that the sage has been dead\nfor over a thousand years and no one\nexcept Confucious himself is qualified\nto interpret his words. But scholars\nbelieve they are qualified and firmly\nhold the final interpretation power in\ntheir hands. This approach is\nessentially stifling thought and\nhindering the progress and development\nof the times. For example, when Wong\nLang crashed into the pillar in front of\nthe palace, to be honest, even Cha Chow\ndidn't know if the Kong family was\ninvolved. But this time, those scholars\nwho attacked him and the Academy of\nSciences were spouting nothing but the\nways and words of sages. They don't even\nknow what technology is or what its\npurpose is. They attack anything that\nisn't in accordance with the way of the\nsages. If this public opinion is related\nto the Kong family, then wiping them out\nwould be they're just deserts. If it has\nnothing to do with the Confucious\nfamily, then destroy it, too. Since the\nConfucious family is the holy land and\nspiritual leader of scholars all over\nthe world, their existence only hinders\nthe development and promotion of\nscience. Anyway, Confucious's thoughts\nand classics have been passed down. So,\nChow Chow wouldn't touch these classic\nbooks. They simply sent Confucious and\nhis unfil descendants who only knew how\nto write petitions of surrender down to\nsee their father. Therefore, when Zhuao\nasked him, Wayi Wu did not hide his\nthoughts and readily admitted them.\nThat's right, brother. I do want to go,\nbut it's also because no one else can do\nit except me. Even if I give those\nthings to others, they won't know how to\noperate them. Only I know how to use\nthem in combination. Zu Bao understood\nwhat we wu meant. Putting aside how\nprecious We Woos things were, it was\nimpossible for him to give them to\nothers to use. Even if someone else were\nto use it, they would need to know how\nto use it. Like the drone that we woo\ngave to Zhu Xiongyang, let alone\noperating it. If he doesn't demonstrate\nit once, most people wouldn't even be\nable to figure out what this thing does.\nMoreover, according to Wei Wu's plan,\nthis mission was to infiltrate the White\nLotus Sect. If you're not familiar with\nthese things, how can you adapt to\nchanging circumstances and solve\ndifficult problems? Although the logic\nwas sound, Zhuao genuinely wanted to\nrefuse. This is not a trip for Wei Wu to\nenjoy the scenery. This is a matter\nwhere one wrong step could lead to\ndeath. However, before Zhu Bao could\nrefuse, we wu spoke first. Brother, I\nknow you're worried about my safety, but\nthink about it carefully. Is there any\nplace in this world that is absolutely\nsafe? Inon Prefecture is the capital of\nour great Ming dynasty, right under the\nemperor's nose. Yet, I have already\nsurvived two assassination attempts\nrecently. The imperial palace is heavily\nguarded. Yet, those with ulterior\nmotives still managed to find ways to Wu\nstopped there, but Zu Bao understood\nwhat he meant. If there were truly a\ncompletely safe place, Sister Chong\nwouldn't have died, and Xionging\nwouldn't have contracted smallox. The\nthought of his beloved's death caused\nZhu Bao unbearable pain in his heart. He\nwould accept it if it were truly a case\nof beauty being short-lived. But now, it\nseems she was secretly harmed by others.\nFrom a personal perspective, he\ngenuinely hoped that Wayi Wu could help\nhim avenge the grudge he couldn't lift\nhimself. Seeing the expression on\nZhua&lt;unk&gt;s face, Wayi Wu quickly\ncontinued, \"Brother, you know my\nmethods. Even if I'm exposed and someone\ntries to harm me, I can just kill them\nall.\" These words reminded Zu Bao of the\nscene he had witnessed in the tea house\nthat day. With that kind of weapon\nprotecting him, there are indeed very\nfew people in this world who can\nthreaten Wei Wu. However, Zhu Bao knew\nin his heart that this was not a\ndecision he could make. So he patted Wei\nWu on the shoulder and said, \"All right,\nShiao Wu, I know you're capable, but you\nneed to be careful with both the White\nLotus sect and the Confucious family of\nSufu. We need to discuss this with my\nfather before making a decision, but I'm\nnot confident I can convince him to take\nthis risk himself.\" Upon hearing\nZhua&lt;unk&gt;s reply, we nodded and said,\n\"Nothing more. For him, this answer was\nenough.\" The two then parted ways. As\nWei Wu left the palace, Zuao also went\nto Funian Hall to find Zu Yuan Jang.\nAfter the news brought by Wei Wu was\nrelayed, the old man and the young man\nremained silent in the Funian Hall.\nAfter a long while, Zu Yuan Jan looked\nat Zu Bao with a cold glint in his eyes.\nBowerer, what do you think of Xiao\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s idea? For anyone else, this\nwould just be wishful thinking, but Xiao\nWu, he might become the Kong family's\nnightmare. Zhu Yuan Jang shook his head.\nYou know that's not what we're asking.\nUpon hearing this, Zhu Bao fell silent\nfor a long time before slowly speaking.\nFather, your son desperately wants to\ntake revenge and wipe out the entire\nKong family. Zhu Yuan Jang chuckled upon\nhearing this. Bower, you are more suited\nto be a good emperor than we are, but\nsometimes you are too meticulous. We can\nsee that you really treat Shia Wu like a\nyounger brother, which is why you can't\nget over this issue. It was Shiao Wu who\nsuggested going to the White Lotus sect,\nbut you always feel that you're using\nhim to help you get revenge. As he\nspoke, he gently patted Zhu Bow's\nshoulder again and then continued, \"You\nunderestimate that kid. Although he's\nlazy, he's not stupid and he's very\nopinionated. Although we can't guess\nwhat's wrong with him, he actually gave\nup enjoying his peaceful life and took\nthe initiative to do this. However, one\nthing is certain. The fact that he\nproposed this plan and personally\nimplemented it means that he himself had\nthis intention. Otherwise, Jean Hai\ncould have just handed Lugu over to you.\nWhy would he have gone to the East\nPalace to tell you all this? Sometimes\nbeing thoughtful is a good thing, but\nsometimes being straightforward like us\nis also a good thing. At this point, Zhu\nYuan Jang even chuckled. We never\nexpected that this brat Shia Wu would\ncome up with such a plan, using the\nWhite Lotus sect to wipe out the Kong\nfamily. We've been holding this grudge\nagainst the Kong family for over a\ndecade, and now finally someone can help\nus get revenge, and it's our son-in-law.\nHaha. After listening to Zhu Yuan\nJang&lt;unk&gt;s words, Zhu Bao was stunned\nfor a moment before he came to his\nsenses. Father, do you mean you're not\ngoing to try to dissuade Xiaawu? Why are\nyou trying to stop me? Chapter 155.\nSugar, flint lock, pistol, and a string\nof good news. Seeing that Zhu Bao still\nhad a furrowed brow, Zhu Yuan Jang spoke\nagain. Bowerer, do you think you value\nXiao Wu&lt;unk&gt;s life more, or does he\nvalue his own life more? Upon hearing\nthis, Zhu Bowso's brows finally relaxed.\nWe promised him that we would let him go\nto the battlefield when we fought\nagainst the Japanese pirates. Now, we're\nletting him get used to the danger ahead\nof time. This brat is still just a\nfledgling. Only through tempering can he\ngrow into a soaring eagle. At this\npoint, a hint of helplessness flashed\nacross Zhu Yu and Jong&lt;unk&gt;s face. But\nyou have to keep this a secret from your\nmother. We don't know what kind of spell\nthat Brad has cast on her, but your\nmother dotes on him. If your mother\nfinds out that we let Xiao Wu infiltrate\nthe White Lotus sect alone, we'll be in\nbig trouble, and you won't escape\neither. As soon as Zu Yuan Jang finished\nspeaking, Zhua grinned. He knew all too\nwell the place Wei Wu held in his\nmother's heart. He was a precious\ntreasure. During this period, whenever\nhe went to the inner palace to pay his\nrespects, he would always praise Empress\nMa of Wei Wu. Everyone says that their\nown child is the best. But Zhu Bao felt\nthat Wayi Wu was more like his own son\nthan his own son. Two days have passed\nsince Zhu Bao and Zu Yuan Jang discussed\nthe matter of Chiaoch leaving the\ncapital at the function hall. Early that\nmorning, Wei Wu got out of bed, but\ninstead of going to the science and\ntechnology institute, he went to the\nsugar workshop. That's right. The sugar\nworkshop is all set up. The day he\nreturned from the Eastern Palace, Ching\nXiao had already bought two workshops\nand was waiting for him at home. Not\nonly was the workshop arranged, but even\nthe honey separator needed for the final\nstep was also arranged. Weii Wu\noriginally planned to wait until the\nscience institute was finished before\nasking the carpentry team to help with\nthe construction. As it turned out, he\njust mentioned it casually, and Seang\nhappened to overhear it. Seang then\nrecommended his father Seong Chiian to\nWei Wu, saying that Seians skills were\neven better than Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s. It is\nworth mentioning that although Seian was\na bit old, his personal skills were\ntruly exceptional. Weii Wu only\nmentioned a little bit about the\ncentrifugal force needed for the honey\nseparator and Sei immediately knew what\nto do. With the tools provided by Chow\nChow, Sei built the honey separator in\njust one day. Actually, this thing\nitself isn't very difficult to make. The\nmain time-consuming parts are the\npolishing and the rotating disc in the\nmiddle. The principle is the same as\nthat of an old-fashioned sewing machine.\nYou can turn the centrifugal disc by\nstepping on it. Ching Xiao was also an\nimpatient person. She had already\nstockpiled all the raw materials before\nthe honey separating machine was even\nfinished. After the honey extractor was\nsuccessfully manufactured, she\nimmediately had the workers begin the\nprocess. She didn't waste a single\nmoment of those two days, preferring to\npay the workers more so they would work\novertime. They managed to handle all the\ntedious processes, including juicing,\nfiltering, sedimentation, and boiling.\nAfter last night's boiling process, most\nof the moisture in the molasses has\nevaporated, and it will soon be ready to\nbe extracted into sugar. Upon arriving\nat the sugar workshop, Wayi Wu was\nimmediately greeted by a rich, sweet\naroma. Two workers were holding up a\nwooden bucket and slowly pouring the\nmolasses inside into the feed inlet of\nthe molasses separator. Now comes the\nmoment to witness a miracle. As the disc\nof the molasses separator rotates at\nhigh speed, strands of molasses with\ncompletely different colors are flung\nonto the civ. Then the worker took a\nwooden shovel and slowly scraped it down\nthe screen inside the honey separator.\nBefore long, a smear of soft snowflake\ncolored white sugar appeared at the\noutlet of the sugar separator. The two\nworkers eyes nearly popped out of their\nsockets as they stared at the snow white\nsugar in front of them. They were\nexperienced sugar makers, but they had\nnever seen such exquisite icing. If the\nshopkeeper hadn't been standing right\nnext to them, they would have loved to\njust grab some and pop it in their\nmouths to taste it. Similarly, upon\nseeing the white frosting appear,\nBridget Lynn, who had been tense all\nalong, finally breathed a sigh of\nrelief. Seeing Weii Wu standing not far\nbehind her, Ching Shia quickly stepped\nforward, scooped up a spoonful of white\nsugar, and brought it to Wei Wu. Young\nmaster, it's really done. We've really\nmade this snowflake candy. Only you can\ntaste the first bite. Seeing the\nexpectant look on Ching Xia's face, Weii\nWu reached out, picked up a piece of\nwhite sugar, and put it in his mouth. In\nterms of sweetness, it still falls short\nof the precise industrial standards of\nlater generations, but it is still a\nvery good finished product. Going\nforward, all we need to do is learn from\nthe experience gained during the\nproduction process and continuously\nadjust to strive for perfection. Very\ngood. Ching Xia from now on this sugar\nworkshop will be in your care. Upon\nreceiving Weii Wu&lt;unk&gt;s affirmation,\nChing Xia's eyes narrowed with\nexcitement. Young master, rest assured,\nChing Xia will definitely not let you\ndown. I believe you. But now, let\neveryone have a taste. After all, you\nworked so hard to make it. Upon hearing\nWeii Wu&lt;unk&gt;s words, the laborers who've\nbeen eagerly anticipating the meal\nimmediately became excited. Then under\nChing Xiao's arrangement, everyone\ntasted the white sugar. The white sugar,\nas white as snow and as sweet as honey,\nimmediately brought a look of enjoyment\nto their faces. In fact, as sugar\nmakers, sugar is not unfamiliar to them,\nand they have often secretly eaten brown\nsugar in the past. The reason for this\nreaction is most likely due to the\nnovelty and unfamiliarity of the\nexperience. Seeing the expression on the\nworker's face, Wei Wu smiled and turned\nto look at Ching Xia. Sell the snowflake\ncandy at the Beeh High Xiaosing\nbuilding. It's a waste to only sell\nmedicine in such a big shop. As for the\npricing issue, things are valued for\ntheir scarcity. One tale of snowflake\ncandy sells for one tale of silver.\nWe'll decide on the price later when the\nquantity increases. Chingsha nodded,\nkeeping Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s words firmly in\nmind. After that, Wayi Woo stayed in the\nsugar workshop for a while longer. After\npackaging the first batch of white sugar\nproduced, they rushed to the science and\ntechnology institute. Thanks to the\nefforts of the construction team, the\nAcademy of Sciences has undergone some\nchanges. First, there's the road. From\nthe moment you step in all the way to\nthe classroom where we taught, the\nconstruction team laid a smooth concrete\nroad that was not wide, but rather long.\nMoreover, in order to lay more cement,\nthey even paid people to pave the roads.\nIn addition to the path leading to the\nclassroom, two more cement roads are\ncurrently under construction. According\nto Wu Chong, he plans to use cement to\npave all the roads in the science\ninstitute's compound. In the future,\neven if there's a heavy rainstorm, you\nwill no longer have to worry about\nwalking through muddy areas. Weii Wu\nexpressed his support for this, saying\nhe wished he could build a concrete road\ndirectly from the Academy of Sciences to\nthe capital. This will make it much\neasier for him to come to the Academy of\nSciences in the future, and he won't\nvomit bile when riding in a horsedrawn\ncarriage. After entering through the\nmain gate of the manor, we woo followed\nthe concrete path straight to the\nclassroom gate. Before they even went\ninside, an incredibly excited shout came\nfrom behind them. Vice Dean, Vice Dean,\nwe made it. We've made the flint lock\ngun you mentioned. Upon hearing this,\nWei Wu turned around just as Yong Chow\nhad run up to him. He immediately asked,\n\"Have you tested it?\" \"We've already\ntested it once, and we were just waiting\nfor you to come so we could test it\nagain in front of you. Then what are we\nwaiting for? Let's go test the gun.\"\nChapter 156. The flint lock musket is\nincredibly powerful. The improved steel\ncore minery bullet\nui woo. The group arrived at the\nshooting range where Shanun Linn and his\nfriends were practicing. I thought I was\nall ready, but when I arrived at the\nfiring range, I found it completely\nempty. Fortunately, not long after, the\nother two members of the firearms team\ncame to him with flint lock pistols. To\nweigh Woo surprise, the assembled flint\nlock musketss were not just one, but a\nfull five. It has to be said that Yong\nChow actually managed to make this thing\nusing only his incredibly abstract\nblueprints. Moreover, the appearance is\nquite realistic, almost identical to\nwhat he saw in his previous videos.\nAfter scrutinizing him for a while, Wei\nWu turned to look at Yong Xiao. Tell me\nit's specific data and how well the\nflint lock gun performed after your\ntests. Yong Xiao, who had been eager to\nshow off his results, could no longer\nhold back upon hearing this. He grabbed\na rifled flint lock musket and quickly\nwalked to Wayi Wu&lt;unk&gt;s side. Vistine,\nlook at the gate. Based on the\nblueprints and ideas you provided, plus\nthat machine tool that could be\ndescribed as a marvel, we carved four\nrifling grooves in this barrel with the\ngrooves spiraling from beginning to end\nrunning through the entire barrel. Weii\nWoo took the flint lock musket, first\nchecked the powder chamber and confirmed\nthat there was no gunpowder residue.\nOnly then should you hold the gun barrel\nin front of your eyes to observe it,\njust in case it accidentally goes off\nand there's no way to save it. Seeing\nthe spiral streamlined rifling in the\ngun barrel, Wei Wu couldn't help but\nsigh. No wonder machine tools are called\nmachining centers. The rifling can only\nbe described as silky smooth. Just as\nWeii Wu was carefully examining the\nsituation, Yang Chow spoke up again. And\nthe mini bullet you mentioned, after\nprecise measurements, we also produced\none that perfectly matches the\ndimensions of the gun barrel. After\ntesting, just as you said, this bullet\nwhen used with a rifled flint lock\nmusket is incredibly powerful. Ordinary\nfirearms have little power beyond 30\nfeet, but this one is still incredibly\npowerful even at 50 ft. But we only did\na simple test and we plan to record more\naccurate data after you have reviewed\nit. As they were talking, Yang Xiao\npicked up a flint lock musket in front\nof Wei Woo and poured the prepared\ngunpowder into the barrel. Then he took\nout a mini bullet and put into the\nbarrel using the push rod to compact the\nmini bullet and gunpowder. Immediately\nafterwards, the other two members of the\nfirearms team also loaded two flint lock\nmusketss and aimed the muzzles at the\ntarget. Weii Wu looked in that direction\nand was immediately stunned to see a\nwall placed 50 ft away. That thing is a\ntarget. Seeing the expression on Wei\nWu's face, Yong Chow and the others felt\na little embarrassed. Well, the main\nproblem is that the three of us aren't\ngood at aiming. In order to test the\npower of the flint lock musket, we had\nto make the target bigger. Actually, we\ncould go even further, but we were\nworried about missing the target. So, we\ncould only test at a distance of 50\njang. After Yong Xiao finished speaking,\nWayi Wu nodded slowly and said nothing\nmore. They are researchers after all.\nIt's already quite an achievement that\nthey could hit the target from such a\ndistance. Let's test the gun first. Upon\nreceiving Weii Woos order, the three men\nfocused intently on aiming for a long\ntime before pulling the trigger. The\nsparks from the pebbles and flint fixed\nto the trigger instantly ignited the\ngunpowder in the powder chamber. As\nthick smoke rose from the gun barrels,\nthree loud gunshots rang out. Bang!\nBang! Bang! The high-speed spinning\nbullet shot out of the barrel, causing\nthe surrounding smoke to drift forward a\nshort distance. After the smoke cleared,\nthe group arrived at the target. The\ntarget is about four or five meters high\nand seven or eight meters long and is\nmade entirely of wooden planks. However,\nthere were only two bullet holes on the\nwooden target at the moment. So, it was\nno surprise that someone missed. But\nthat's not the point. What's really\nimportant is that the two bullet holes\nin the wooden board were through holes.\nThis made Wei Woo somewhat puzzled.\nWhile the mini bullet is indeed powerful\nand accurate, it is made of a relatively\nsoft metal like lead. Looking at the\nthickness of the wooden plank, at a\ndistance of 165 m, a lead bullet\nshouldn't be able to penetrate it. Just\nas we Wu was wondering, Yang Chow\nsuddenly spoke up. Vice, you must be\nwondering why the power of this minor\nmissile has increased, right? That's\nright. Lead is a soft metal that is\nmalleable, so it shouldn't be able to\npenetrate such a thick wooden board.\nUpon hearing wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s words, Yang\nChow chuckled and immediately explained,\n\"If it were just lead, it naturally\nwouldn't have this kind of power, but\nwe've made some improvements to this\nminor bullet. We found bullets left\nbehind by you when you were training the\nguards at the shooting range and\ndiscovered that the bullets you used\nwere actually made of brass.\" So, we\nwere thinking, could we change the\nmaterial of the minor bullet and use a\nharder metal? This not only greatly\nincreases the power of the miner's\nbullet, but also gives it stronger\npenetraability. So, we used refined\niron. As he spoke, Yang Xiao took out a\nmini bullet and placed it in front of\nWei Wu. Weii Wu took it and examined it\ncarefully, discovering that the minor\nbullet was still made of lead with only\na slight difference at the front end.\nJust as he was examining the situation\nclosely, Yong Chow's voice came from the\nside again. You said that lead was used\nto make mini bullets mainly because it\nis soft and its tail expands when pushed\nby a cork. This allows for a better fit\nwith the rifling inside the barrel,\nensuring not only air tightness, but\nalso maximizing the effectiveness of the\nrifling. So, we didn't change the\nmaterial or the shape of the mini\nbullet. We just worked on the warhead.\nYang Chow took the bullet from Wei Woo\nand then pointed to the conicle part of\nthe bullet. We used the machine tool you\ngave us to hollow out part of the bullet\nhead and then made an inlay out of\nrefined iron. It will not compromise the\nair tightness, but will improve the\npenetration of the mini bullet and will\nnot affect the trajectory due to the\nimprovement. As he spoke, Yang Xiao took\nout something that looked like a shovel\nfrom somewhere. I used the sharpest edge\nof the bullet to pry it up for a while.\nThen Wayi Wu saw that at the top of the\nmini bullet, Yong Xiao had picked out\nsomething that looked like a small\numbrella. No wonder Yong Xiao said that\nthe improvements would not affect the\ntrajectory. The inlays they created were\nthemselves cones perfectly fitting the\nshape of the bullet. So, how could they\naffect the trajectory? Isn't this just a\nsimplified version of a steel core\nbullet? But what surprised Weu the most\nwas not their improvement of the\nbullets, but their attitude in trying to\nimprove them. Yang Xiao, I am very\npleased that you have such innovative\nideas. I hope you can continue to\nmaintain them in the future. The three\nwere overjoyed to receive Weii Wu&lt;unk&gt;s\npraise. This is praise from the teacher\nand it's also an affirmation of their\nefforts and achievements. Just as the\nthree were secretly overjoyed, Wayi Woo\nsuddenly took out an oil paper package\nand handed it to them. This is white\nsugar that I had made about a pound. You\nwill add it to the gunpowder in\nproportion later. However, there is one\nthing you must remember. Although\ngunpowder with sugar is more powerful,\nit leaves behind residue that is\ndifficult to clean. Therefore, it can\nonly be used to make explosives and\ncannot be used for firing guns.\nOtherwise, it will greatly reduce the\nservice life of the guns. Chapter 157.\nAbandoning clay molds and revealing the\nmethod of casting cannons using iron\nmolds. The three, who were initially\nexcited, were so thrilled by Wei Woos\nwords that they almost jumped up and\ndown on the spot. They had long wanted\nto test the power of gunpowder with\nadded sugar. Now that way, Wu has taken\nout the white sugar. The three of them\nare eager to immediately prepare the\ngunpowder. That's right. In the science\ninstitute, gunpowder is not allowed to\nbe stored. It must be prepared only when\nneeded. This rule wasn't set by Wei Wu.\nIt was set by Yang Xiao and his group\nthemselves. In their words, gunpowder is\nextremely dangerous and must be handled\nwith extreme caution. Otherwise, if\nsomething goes wrong, not only will the\nfirearms team suffer losses, but other\nteams will also be affected. We woo had\nno objection to this. On the contrary,\nhe felt that their sense of security was\nvery strong. The three members of the\nfirearms team took the oil paper package\nfrom Wei Woo, their hearts pounding like\nants crawling inside them. We woo could\nalso see that they were a bit impatient,\nand he himself was also looking forward\nto doing this experiment. After all, he\nhad heard the one sulfur, two sulfur,\nthree charcoal. Add some white sugar.\nIvan the great joke countless times, but\nhe had never actually seen it. In the\npast, during the spring festival, he\nliked to buy some high-powered\nfirecrackers and double bangers to blast\nother things. There's a strong sense of\nexcitement when pots, pans, bricks, and\nplanks are blown up. No man dislikes a\nhigh-powered cannon, whether it's on the\nbed or on the floor. That's why he\ncouldn't let Yong Sha and the others\nconduct the experiment because he still\nhad questions about the cannon. Yeah,\nthe kind that's placed on the ground.\nTherefore, when the three members of the\nfirearms team were eager to try, Wayi Wu\nimmediately asked him a question. We'll\ndeal with testing the gunpowder's power\nlater. Let's talk about the flint lock\nmusket and the two types of cannons I\ntold you about. Now, let's talk about\nthe flint lock musketss first. How many\nof these musketss did you make in total\nand how long did it take to make each\none? As soon as we finished speaking,\nYang Xiao immediately gave his reply.\nReporting to the vice dean, we have\nproduced a total of five. As for the\nproduction time, that is not something\nwe can decide. With the machine tools\nyou provided, we can make a gun barrel\nin less than the time it takes to burn\nan incense stick. And with the trigger\nand other parts, it will only take half\nan hour. In the past 2 days, we have\nmade a total of 30 gun barrels and\nmatching parts, but the gun rack and\nstock still need to be made by a\ncarpenter. At this point, Yang Chow\nscratched his head sheepishly. The\ncarpentry team has been busy lately, so\nI had to ask the accountant for money\nand find a group of faux carpenters to\nhelp build the structure. Seeing his\nexpression, Wayi Wu chuckled and patted\nhim on the shoulder. Remember, as long\nas it's not for personal gain, it's\ncorrect to use public funds for\nresearch, so there's no need to be\nembarrassed. Hearing Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s words,\nYong Chow breathed a sigh of relief and\nthen continued, \"I have urged them to\ncomplete the work as soon as possible\nwith high quality and quantity. In 5\ndays, there should be no problem with 30\nflint lock guns. The only problem is\nthat the production of the minor bullets\nis a bit complicated. Although they can\nbe mass-produced using iron molds, the\npolishing process takes a lot of time.\nAfter our institute showcases its\nachievements, this time I plan to ask\nSun Chong and his team to help design\nand build a steam engine. With the power\nof the steam engine, all we need to do\nis find a few handymen and teach them\nhow to polish, and it will be much\neasier from now on. After Yong Chow\nfinished speaking, Wayi Wu nodded in\nsatisfaction. The craftsmen in the\nscience and technology institutes are\nnow beginning to be aware of using\nmechanical tools to create convenience,\nwhich is excellent. 30 flint lock\nmusketss are enough. On the day of the\ndemonstration, we can use a three-stage\nfiring method to show their power. Also,\nhow's the cannon I asked you to cast\ncoming along? Are there any finished\nproducts you can bring out for testing?\nAfter Wei Wu finished speaking, the\nemotions of Yang Xiao and the other two\nwere noticeably less high than before.\nDean, casting cannons is different from\ncasting firearms. Making cannon barrels\nrequires clay molds. And we have only\njust begun making the molds. Even if you\nuse charcoal fire to slowly dry the\nclay, it will take at least a month for\nthe clay mold to dry completely, and the\nfinished product will take at least 2\nmonths. After listening to Wei Wu, he\nsuddenly remembered that the Ming\nandQing dynasties use clay molds and a\nsmall amount of lost wax casting to make\ncannons. Both of these methods of\ncasting cannons require time. And even\nthe lost wax casting method has\ntemperature requirements. To be honest,\nWayi Wu felt something was strange. With\nthe wisdom of the ancients, they would\nhave thought of using iron molds to cast\ncannons. So why didn't they use them?\nThinking of this, he simply asked\ndirectly, \"Why not use iron molds to\ncast cannons? One mole can be used from\nmultiple castings, which not only saves\ncost, but also saves a lot of time.\"\nUpon hearing this, Yang Xiao gave a rice\nsmile. Deputy Dean, \"It's not that we\ndon't use iron molds, but that although\nthe cannon barrels cast with iron molds\nare hard, they are too brittle.\" At\nfirst, there was nothing wrong, but\nafter a period of use the cannons, the\nbarrels would crack from the shock, and\nthere were several instances of barrel\nexplosions. As soon as Yang Chow\ngrasped the crux of the problem. When\nyou cast the cannons using iron molds,\ndid you not perform an annealing\nprocess? What is annealing? Is it the\nsame as quenching? If it is quenching,\nthen we do have this process. Upon\nhearing this, Wayi Wu helplessly covered\nhis forehead, unsure of what to say for\na moment. Annealing is a process that\nreduces the hardness of a material,\nthereby improving its toughness and\nmachinability after forming. Quenching\ncan increase the hardness of a material,\nbut it will significantly reduce its\ntoughness and plasticity. Instead of\nannealing, the craftsmen quench the\ncannons, which explains why the cannon\nbarrels exploded multiple times. Because\nthe heat dissipation effect of the iron\nmold is far superior to that of the clay\nmold, the molten iron will condense too\nquickly when cooling. If the molten iron\nsolidifies too quickly, it becomes what\nis known as white cast iron, which is\nhard and brittle and unsuitable for\nmaking cannon barrels. Iron molds\ndissipate heat quickly to begin with,\nand they also use quenching to cool the\nbarrel extremely rapidly. It's no wonder\nit exploded. After a while, Wayi Wu\nrecovered his senses, sighed softly, and\ncontinued speaking. Annealing is not\nquenching. Annealing is the process of\ncontinuing to heat the molten iron after\nit has solidified and formed, keeping it\nin a red-hot state. Maintaining this\nstate for about an hour and then letting\nthe material cool down slowly will make\nit more resilient. And instead of\nannealing, you quench it. You know,\nwhile quenched iron is hard, hard also\nmeans it's more brittle. Although Yong\nXiao was not a blacksmith, as a firearms\ncraftsman, he knew the cannon casting\nprocess very well. Now that he had heard\nwhat we Wu had to say, he finally\nunderstood that the problem with casting\ncannons using iron molds lay here. All\nright, go to the iron works later and\nhave them make the iron mold first, then\nanneal and cast the cannon according to\nmy instructions. Time is running out.\nYou must make the Franco Portuguese\ncannon and the red coat cannon for me\nwithin 5 days. I need at least one of\neach. Remember, you must use a\nmicrometer to accurately determine the\ndimensions of the cannon body and the\nsubc cannon to ensure air tightness and\ngreater power. Chapter 158 battlefield\nweapon, the improved Franco cannon. Many\ntypes of cannons appeared in later\ngenerations, but Chow Chow chose the\nFrankish cannon and the redcoated\ncannon. The breach loading smooth boore\ncannon was introduced to the Ming\ndynasty from Portugal during the gi era.\nFor the officials of the Ming dynasty at\nthat time, this was simply their dream\ncannon. The Franco cannon has four major\nadvantages. The first of which is its\nhigh rate of fire. This type of\nartillery consists of a main cannon and\nthree subc cannons with one main cannon\npaired with three subc cannons. When it\nis time to fire, simply load the subc\ncannon into the main cannon, fire it,\nand then replace it with the second subc\ncannon. Meanwhile, while the third\ncannon is being prepared, the first\ncannon can begin reloading gunpowder and\nshells. It is very similar to the\nthree-stage shooting technique that\nappeared in later generations where the\ngun was changed, but the pilot was not.\nThe main gunner aims, ignites, and fires\nwhile two assistant gunners load the\nammunition and hand it to the main\ngunner. Such operation requires the\ngunner to be highly skilled enabling a\nbreach loading cannon to fire three\ntimes within 20 seconds. Secondly, the\nsecond advantage of the Franco cannon is\nits rapid heat dissipation. The brereech\nloading gun has interconnected front and\nrear sections allowing for greater air\nflow and it separates the subgun from\nthe main gun. The amount of gunpowder\nloaded is fixed by the subgun. So there\nwill be no situation where too much\ngunpowder is loaded which could lead to\nbarrel explosion or overheating.\nMeanwhile, the barrel walls of the\nFranco cannon were thinner and easier to\ndissipate heat because its main\nexplosion was generated in the powder\nchamber. Because of the gun, the\ngunpowder chamber is made particularly\nthick to withstand greater pressure.\nTherefore, the cannon can be loaded with\nmore gunpowder than other cannons, and\nits power is naturally greater. Its\nthird advantage is its great power. And\nits last advantage is that it is easy to\ntransport and maintain. Because the\nbarrel walls are thinner, the weight is\ngreatly reduced, making it easier to\ncarry during marches. Meanwhile, the\nexplosion occurs in the gunpowder\nchamber of the subgun. So even if the\nsubgun is damaged, it can be replaced\nimmediately and used. Of course, the\nbreach loading cannon was not without\nits drawbacks. Its biggest drawback was\nits insufficient range. However, this is\nmainly due to the insufficient level of\nindustrial development in ancient times.\nThe gap between the cannon and the\nbrereech is relatively large, resulting\nin poor air tightness and a naturally\nshort range. There are five or six\ndifferent models of the Franco cannon,\nsome even designed to be carried by a\nperson or a horse. Under normal\ncircumstances, given the industrial\nlevel of the Ming dynasty, it would be\nconsidered fortunate if a small breach\nloading cannon had an effective range of\n350 m. The effective range of a large\nbreach loading cannon would not exceed 3\nmi, at most about 1,200 m. But things\nare different now. With the micrometers\nand machine tools provided by Wei Woo,\nthe air tightness problem could be\nperfectly solved. So, while reminding\nYong Chow to pay attention to the size,\nWayiu also made sure to add a reminder.\nRemember to make the subg gun\ncylindrical, ensuring precise\ndimensions, and create a threaded\nstructure at the interface with the\nbreach. The purpose of doing this is to\nfurther enhance the air tightness, and\nthe power of the artillery will also be\ngreatly increased. After firmly\nremembering Weii Wu&lt;unk&gt;s words, Yang\nXiao immediately spoke. Don't worry,\nVice Dean. We've written all down. We'll\njust copy it down in a book later.\nWayu nodded in satisfaction before\ncontinuing. Furthermore, the purpose of\nthe red cannon was not to be used as a\nmobile artillery piece, but rather as a\nfixed defensive weapon. It is used for\nthe defense of city walls and for fixing\non large ships. So, the cannon barrel\ncan be longer. About 3 m is fine. The\ncaliber is around 110 to 130. It's okay\nto make the barrel thicker as long as\nit's powerful enough and won't explode.\nIn fact, the so-called redcoated cannon\nis not much different in design from\nother cannons. Unlike the breach loading\ncannon, it did not have a design that\nwas significantly different from other\ncannons. They simply optimized the\nfiring range and accuracy of other\nsimilarly designed artillery pieces.\nAlthough its caliber and ammunition\nweight are much larger than other\nartillery pieces. However, because the\nbarrel is 3 m long, the initial velocity\nof the shot is very high, making it more\npowerful than other cannons. In\naddition, the cannon center gravity is\ndesigned with trunions, which serve as\naxes for adjusting the angle and the\namount of gunpowder used. With the\naddition of the crosshair and rear sight\neffects, you can accurately strike\nenemies. Once fired, even if 10 horses\nwere in that straight line, they would\nbe pierced through and turned into\nmincemeat. To be honest, what we woo\ncared about most was not the breach\nloading cannon, but the redcoated\ncannon. Because its power is great\nenough, and power is what men love most\nabout romance. Furthermore, on the day\nthe Scientific Research Institute's\nachievements are showcased, this cannon\ncan deliver an even greater impact to\nthose people. With thick, long cannons,\nwe will destroy their fragile prejudice\nand arrogance. Seeing Yong Xiao and the\nother two deep in thought, Weii Wu\nsmiled slightly and said, \"All right,\nyou can figure out the specifics after I\nleave. Now, let's go and mix the\ngunpowder and try out the Ivan.\" \"Huh,\nIvan the Great. Just think of it as a\nvery powerful bomb.\" Hearing Weii\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s explanation, Yang Xiao and the\nothers didn't think much of it and\nturned around to run out of the firing\nrange to prepare gunpowder. For firearms\ncraftsmen, preparing gunpowder was a\npiece of cake. Moreover, after we woo\nprovided the gunpowder standards,\nwithout those complicated ingredients,\nthe preparation became much easier. Less\nthan the time it takes for an incense\nstick to burn, the three returned with\ntwo finished bombs. Wayu originally\nthought they would make bombs using\nbamboo tubes, just like before. However,\nwhen the people got closer, they\ndiscovered that what they were holding\nwere not bamboo tubes, but iron shells.\nAlthough Weii Wu was fairly\nknowledgeable about the Ming Dynasty, he\ngenuinely had no idea what this thing\nwas. What are you making? As soon as we\nWu finished speaking, Yang Xiao\nimmediately raised the iron case in his\nhand and explained, \"Deput Dean, didn't\nyou say that the better the seal and the\nstronger the shell material, the greater\nthe explosive power? Even if you tie\nseveral loops of hemp rope around a\nbamboo tube, the air tightness and\nmaterial strength cannot maximize the\npower of the gunpowder.\" During the\nnorthern Song Dynasty, there was a type\nof firearm called Ziniani, which used\npig iron to wrap gunpowder. However, the\nproportion of gunpowder was\ninsufficient, resulting in insufficient\npower. At this point, Yang Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s\neyes once again filled with admiration\nas he looked at Wayi Wu. With your\nguidance, our gunpowder is much more\npowerful now. I will use the Thunderclap\nbomb as a reference to make this cast\niron shell. However, we haven't named it\nyet. We were thinking of having you give\nit a catchy name when you come. What do\nyou think? Before Yong Chow could finish\nspeaking, Wayi Wu immediately raised his\nhand to interrupt him. You should name\nwhat you developed yourself. I can't\noverstep my bounds. After saying that,\nWayiu didn't even give Yang Chow a\nchance to speak and continued. All\nright, you can decide on the naming\nlater. Now, let's see the power of\ngunpowder mixed with sugar. Chapter 159.\nhand grenades and landmines.\nTechnological achievements to be\nshowcased. The method for testing the\npower of gunpowder is simple. Just bury\nit in the ground. Just like last time,\nthis method provides the most direct way\nto see the difference in power between\nthe two types of gunpowder. The iron\ncased bombs filled with ordinary\ngunpowder were buried in the ground,\nleaving only the long fuse exposed. Once\nwe Woo had reached a safe distance, Yang\nXiao, who had remained next to the\ngunpowder, lit the fuse and ran away\nquickly. Boom! After an explosion, the\ngroup returned to the sight of the blast\nto investigate. When Yong Chow saw the\npower generated by the ironcased\nexplosives, an undisguised joy appeared\nin his eyes. This iron cased explosive\nused only ordinary gunpowder. Its\nexplosive power was much greater than\nthat of the original bamboo tube. This\nwas sufficient proof that his idea of\nusing an iron shell to make the\ncontainer was correct, as it did indeed\nenhance the power of the gunpowder. Vice\nwe succeeded. Using an iron shell to\nmake a container really does greatly\nincrease its power. Seeing Yong\nXiao&lt;unk&gt;s excitement, Weii Wu smiled\nslightly, patted him on the shoulder,\nand praised him. It's not that we\nsucceeded, it's that you succeeded. But\ndon't be proud of it because this is\njust the beginning. What you need to do\nnext is to improve upon the iron shell\nto make it easier to use on the\nbattlefield. At this point, Wayi Wu felt\nhe should give Yang Sha a hint. So, he\nheld up one finger and said, \"Currently,\nthere are two directions for using iron\nshells as containers. One is to throw\nthem out, and the other is to bury them\nin the ground. The metal case bombs,\nthey're thrown, weigh about one pound,\nso that the soldiers can throw them more\neasily. However, the metal casing itself\ntakes up a lot of weight. You have to\nconsider how to increase the lethality\nwith a limited amount of explosive.\nRemember, it's not explosive power, but\nlethality. At this point, Wayi Woo then\nraised a second finger and continued.\nSecondly, there are iron cased bombs\nburied in the ground. These can have\nlarger iron casings and more gunpowder,\nbut it cannot be lit manually, otherwise\nits effectiveness will be greatly\nreduced. and it will be easily detected\non the battlefield. So, you need to\nthink of a way to detonate the\nexplosives without an open flame, which\nis the so-called triggering device.\nAfter saying that, Wayi Woo extended his\nthird finger. You need to consider three\nissues. How to increase lethality, how\nto create a covert triggering device,\nand how to design a safety device. As\nsoon as we Woo finished speaking, Yong\nXiao had a flash of inspiration and\nlooked at the flint lock pistol beside\nhim. Since flint lock musketss can be\nignited with flint, can't the same\ntriggering device also be made? Seeing\nYong Chow deep in thought, Wei Wu nodded\nslowly, a satisfied expression on his\nface. \"All right, the matter of the iron\nshell bomb is your next task. We'll look\ninto it later.\" \"Now, let's see how\npowerful a metal bomb with added sugar\nis.\" Upon hearing Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s voice,\nYang Xiao snapped out of his days and\nimmediately arranged for a second iron\ncase bomb. Not long after, a deafening\nexplosion came from the firing range and\nechoed over the Academy of Sciences.\nBoom. After the explosion ended, Wei Woo\nand his group quickly arrived at the\nlocation of the explosion. Everyone was\nshocked to see the crater on the ground,\nwhich was clearly one or two sizes\nlarger than before. The same amount of\ngunpowder, but with the addition of\nsugar, has such a much greater power.\nIt's absolutely terrifying. Even Wayi Wu\nwas stunned by the scene before him. He\nknew that gunpowder produces high\ntemperature, high pressure gas when it\nburns, which is the principle behind\ngunpowder explosions. I just didn't\nexpect that the addition of sugar would\naccelerate this combustion reaction to\nthis extent. Even we Woo was stunned,\nlet alone Yong Chow and the others.\nLooking at the crater still emitting\nsmoke, Yong Chow could barely speak.\nWow, so terrifying. so terrifyingly\npowerful and it's just just just some\nsugar. Study this carefully. This is\njust the beginning. After casually\ngiving Yong Chow a word of advice, Wayi\nWu turned and left the shooting range.\nHe originally just wanted to test the\npower of sugar gunpowder, but Yong Chow\nand the others gave him a surprise. The\nflint lock musket was successfully\ndeveloped and its power perfectly met\nhis expectations. In addition, the test\nresults of the sugar gunpowder were also\nextremely impressive. I took a walk\naround the science and technology\ninstitute and checked on the progress of\nother groups. With everything proceeding\nsmoothly, Wu felt relieved and left with\na satisfied expression. In the following\ndays, the capital city was bustling like\nnever before. First, Behi Kaoshloo\nlaunched a new type of dessert, white\nsugar. This delicate white sugar as fine\nas snowflakes quickly gained popularity\namong the powerful and wealthy after its\nlaunch. Of course, the main reason was\nthat Mari Yong Chong Lan Yu accidentally\nadded white sugar to the tofu pudding\nand exclaimed how delicious it was after\neating it. Then it was presented to the\nprince to taste and he received the same\npraise and this way of eating its\nspread. Whether they were military\ngenerals and nobles or civil officials,\nthey all began to v to learn this way of\neating. Although sugar is indeed\nexpensive, this amount of money is\nnothing to them. Because the production\nof white sugar was insufficient, wealthy\npeople began to frantically buy it at\nhigh prices. Secondly, the Imperial\nMedical Academy released a message and\ntwo medications. The message was to tell\npeople that drinking more hot water,\nespecially boiling water, can\neffectively reduce the chances of\ngetting sick. The other two drugs are\ncalled salicylic acid and allisonin.\nThese two medications not only have\nanalesic and heat clearing effects, but\nalso effectively prevent wound abscesses\nand ulceration. Most importantly, the\nImperial Medical Academy also released\nthe production method along with the\nannouncement. Its purpose is to enable\ndoctors across the country to learn and\nuse it so as to better provide treatment\nfor the people. This move not only drew\npraise from the common people but also\ninspired many writers to write eulogies.\nBesides these, another lively event was\ncaused by imperial sensor Hong Lang.\nAfter Hong Lang died remmonstrating with\nZhu Yuan Jang and then smashed his head\nagainst a pillar in front of the palace.\nZhu Yuan Jang did not pursue Hong Langs\ncrime. This also made him famous among\nscholars and for a time he was even\nregarded as an idol by scholars. Many\nscholars from the common people as well\nas literary officials from the imperial\ncourt made a special trip to visit him.\nThese people praised him as the way Jang\nof the Ming dynasty while clearly\nstating that they would stand by his\nside. On the day the Academy of Sciences\nshowcases its achievements, they will\nstand with Huang Lang and eradicate this\ncancerous tumor. After leaving Hong\nLangs residence, these people began to\nsmear the Academy of Science and\nTechnology and Wei Wu himself. It made\nsome sense at first, but it changed its\nmeaning after people started echoing it.\nThey used every shameless tactic\nimaginable, from spreading rumors and\nfabricating lies to fabricate stories.\nAs the saying goes, heaven will make\nsomeone go mad before it will destroy\nthem. And Hang Lang has already flown up\nto the sky. He even forgot that in the\ncapital under the emperor's very nose,\nhis actions were taboo. Even Lee Shan\nChong, who had always been at odds with\nWeii Wu, deliberately kept his distance\nfrom him during this period, fearing\nthat he would be implicated. However,\nHang Lang, who had never been so\nsuccessful, was unaware of his own\nsituation, and allowed it to escalate.\nJust as public opinion reached its peak,\nthe day finally arrived for the Academy\nof Sciences to showcase its\nachievements. The crown prince rode out\nof the palace in an elephant-drawn\ncarriage, followed by civil and military\nofficials and a large number of imperial\nguards. Together with the gentry,\nwealthy merchants, and curious\ncommoners, they slowly drove out of the\ncity. Chapter 1. 60. Marquee Chong Lu,\nwhat are your true intentions? Wayi Wu\narranged three parts for the exhibition\nof the Academy of Scienc's Achievements.\nThe first part is about the powerful\nconstruction capabilities of cement\nwhich will be showcased at the science\nand technology institute. After all, the\nconstruction team spent most of their\nenergy and materials on this. Secondly,\nthe steamships of the blacksmith and\ncarpenter groups were arranged on the\nbanks of the Yangze River, not far from\nthe Academy of Sciences. Finally,\nthere's the firearms group. Because\ntheir achievements were so powerful and\nrequired a certain degree of secrecy,\nthey were placed in military camps. As\nearly as the founding of the Academy of\nSciences, Zhu Yuan Jang had specifically\nconsidered the issue of technology\nleaks. Therefore, when selecting a site\nfor the Academy of Sciences, a location\nclose to a military camp was\nspecifically chosen. Just then, the\nAcademy of Sciences was showcasing its\nachievements, and Zu Yuan Jang specially\ntransferred soldiers from the military\ncamp to maintain order. In front of the\ngate of the Science and Technology\nInstitute, we Woo and his construction\nteam of craftsmen stood at the door\nearly in the morning, waiting. After\nwaiting for less than 10 minutes, I saw\na group of people walking towards me in\nthe distance. Leading the procession was\nan extremely luxurious elephant chariot,\nwhich judging from its specifications\nand decorations, appeared to be Zu Yuan\nJangs personal carriage. However, Chow\nChow knew very well that the person\nsitting in the elephant carriage was not\nZu Bao, but the crown prince Zuao. The\nentourage on either side of the imperial\ncarriage consisted of either guards or\nofficials, all of whom were influential\nfigures in the court. Besides the core\nmanagers of various departments and some\nsensors, the majority were military\ngenerals and nobles. However, overall\nofficials do not make up the largest\nproportion. These officials combined\nonly accounted for about 20% while\nwealthy merchants and ordinary people\neach accounted for about 40%. However,\nthese are the people who will be able to\nvisit the Academy of Sciences later. The\nmajority of the people were those who\nhad come along from outside wanting to\nwatch the spectacle. As the crowd moved,\nthe elephant carriage soon arrived at a\nlocation about 100 m outside the science\nand technology institute. Here, the\nelephant chariot, which had been moving\nslowly and bumpily, not only moved\nfaster, but also became more stable. The\nreason is simple. A 100 meter long\nconcrete road has been laid from the\ngate of the science and technology\ninstitute to the location of the\nShianglu. In fact, even Vice Dean Wei Wu\nwas somewhat surprised by this. He\noriginally thought the construction team\nwould focus their efforts on the\ninterior of the science institute, but\nhe didn't expect them to work on the\nexterior as well. He specifically asked\nWu Chan about this, and the answer he\nreceived left him speechless. The reason\nis that unlike other groups, the\nconstruction team's results were not\njaw-dropping. To make the cement display\nmore effective, a large amount of cement\nmust be laid on a large scale to create\na truly impressive effect. Actually, the\nmost difficult part of making cement is\nnot the raw materials, but the process\nof firing and grinding them into powder.\nSo, they borrowed a kiln from a friend\nand hired a large number of laborers to\nhelp them. At the same time, by\nutilizing the water wheels that the\ncarpenters had previously made, they\nbarely managed to achieve the situation\nthat Wu Chong had envisioned. Now, not\nonly is the entire interior of the\nscience institute paved with cement\nroads, but even area outside the gate\nhas a 100 m long cement road. Although\nthe intense rush to meet the deadline\nalmost exhausted the construction team,\nthey had to admit they succeeded. As the\nimperial carriage traveled smoothly on\nthe concrete road, officials, wealthy\nmerchants, and ordinary people also\nstepped onto the cement road. The sudden\ntransformation from a dirt road to a\nsmooth, solid surface drew gasps of\namazement from onlookers. An official\nstomped hard on the concrete road and\nthen scraped the mud off the soles of\nhis feet. What a strange road surface.\nIt's neither paved with stone slabs nor\nbricks, yet so hard and not slippery at\nall. Moreover, although the road surface\nis not as luxurious as the floor tiles\nof the palace hall, it is much smoother\nwithout even a single gap. As the\nofficial was speaking, a military\nnobleman was also looking at the\nconcrete floor with great curiosity.\nThen his eyes lit up and he saw a rock\nabout the size of an adult's fist by the\nroadside. It has to be said that\nmilitary generals are reckless. This guy\nactually picked up the stone and slammed\nit hard onto the floor. Clang. A crisp\nsound rang out and the stone shattered\ninto several pieces on the spot,\ndemonstrating the great force the\ngeneral had exerted. If the stone had\nhit an ordinary stone-paved road, it\nwould probably have cracked on the spot.\nHowever, after the general cleared away\nthe gravel, he discovered that the\nconcrete road was completely undamaged.\nThat is, the spot where the stone hit\nhad a small dent the size of a grain of\nrice, which was no different from being\ncompletely intact. Upon seeing this, not\nonly were the officials amazed, but the\nsurrounding civilians also stared\nwideeyed. When did this road come about?\nI remember passing by here just a few\ndays ago, and I didn't see it. Yes, yes,\nmy home is not far away. I didn't see\nthis road when I went fishing by the\nriver a few days ago. No way could such\na smooth and sturdy road have been built\nin just a few days. Hearing the people's\nchatter, the merchants eyes immediately\nlit up, for they had smelled the scent\nof money. Although they didn't know what\nit was, they were able to build such a\ngood road in the wild. If it were moved\nto the city, it would probably be even\nmore effective. Moreover, the locals\nsaid that this road didn't exist a few\ndays ago, but it suddenly appeared\ntoday. The fact that such a good road\ncould be built in such a short time\nundoubtedly makes it much more\npractical. At this point, merchants\nbegan to imagine whether this building\nmaterial could be used on other levels.\nBefore they could think much about it,\nthe convoy had already arrived in front\nof the science and technology institute.\nAfter the palace maid opened the wooden\ndoor of a sedan chair, Zhuao lifted the\ncurtain and stepped out of the sedan\nchair. Upon seeing the crown prince\nappear, everyone bowed in greeting and\nZuao raised his hand and waved. No need\nfor formalities. After speaking, Zhu Bao\nturned to look at Wayi Wu with a smile.\nLord Chong Lu, today I have brought all\nmy officials here, intending to broaden\nyour horizons. Are you ready? Your\nhighness, rest assured, we will not\ndisappoint you and the officials today.\nThen it's up to you now. The two\nexchanged a smile, but Zu Bao's gaze was\nthen drawn to a few large characters on\nthe side. The Imperial Science and\nTechnology Research Institute of the\nMing Dynasty. The nine large characters\nare all made of concrete and stand\nvertically in front of the Science and\nTechnology Institute's gate. Besides Zhu\nBao, the officials, wealthy merchants,\nand ordinary people all looked at the\nnine cement characters with curiosity.\nAfter all, the Ming dynasty had never\npresented it in this way before. Just as\neveryone was examining the signboard,\nWayi Wu picked up a red megaphone and\nput to his lips. Ladies and gentlemen,\nnext I will introduce to you one of the\nachievements that our institute is very\nproud of. Cement. People were surprised\nagain when they heard the sound coming\nfrom the loudspeaker. Meanwhile, those\nin the crowd who have been itching to\nact were also preparing to take action.\nSeveral young men dressed as scholars\nwho looked somewhat immature walked out\nfrom the crowd. The Earl of Chonglu, as\na meritorious noble of the Ming dynasty,\ndoes not think about assisting the\nemperor and serving the country, but\nonly cares about studying strange and\ningenious skills. For the sake of the\ncountry, Imperial sensor Hang Lang even\nrisked his life to remmonstrate with the\nemperor by crashing into a pillar in\nfront of the palace, and the Ming\ndynasty almost lost a wise minister for\nall time. Not only do you show no\nremorse, but you also dare to spread\nfalsehoods and mislead the public. What\nare your true intentions? Chapter 161.\nCement is a divine substance that\nbenefits the country and its people.\nYou're a useless scourges that bring\nA wise minister throughout the ages to\ndie for the country and its people by\nstriking his head against a pillar as a\nsign of his loyalty. Upon hearing what\nthese scholars said, Wayi Wu almost\nburst out laughing on the spot. Although\nI had expected that someone would\ndefinitely step forward to cause\ntrouble. The way they cause trouble was\nsomewhat amusing. What virtue or ability\ndid Hang Lang possess to dare call\nhimself a wise minister for all time. As\nfor his dying remmonstrance to\ndemonstrate his loyalty, that goes\nwithout saying. It's not like the bones\nare cracked, just some broken skin and\nflesh. And yet scholars still praise it\nto the skies. Looking at the scholars\nwho are talking, Wayi Wu deliberately\nput on a puzzled expression. You say\nthat Imperial sensor Hang committed\nsuicide by crashing into a pillar in\nfront of the palace to express his\nremmonstrance. But what does that have\nto do with me? Weii Wu, why should I\nfeel guilty? Our bodies and hair are\ngiven to us by our parents. Since\nImperial sensor Hang deliberately\ndamaged his body, his father should be\nthe one to discipline him. I am not his\nfather. And I must ask another question.\nYou say he died to uphold his\nprinciples. Then I must ask, did he\nactually die? Wayi Wu&lt;unk&gt;s remarks are\nlike chocolate. People can eat it\nwithout harm, but dogs will be poisoned.\nSo after he finished speaking, the\ncommon people and wealthy merchants just\nwatched the spectacle, but the scholars\nlooked as if their fathers had died. One\nof the scholars even stepped forward,\nstaring directly at Wayi Wu. Heaven has\nprotected Imperial sensor Hang so that\nhe still has a breath left. If something\nwere to happen to him, the Earl of\nChangangle would surely be cursed by\neveryone and leave a bad name for 10,000\nyears. After the scholar finished\nspeaking, the people next to him\nimmediately chimed in to support him.\nYes, Marquee of Changangle should be\nglad that Imperial Sensor Hang was only\nseriously injured. Otherwise, he would\nsurely be despised and cursed by future\ngenerations. Indeed, if Imperial sensor\nHang dies, marquee of Changangle, you\ncan expect to be condemned by the\nscholars of the world. Several scholars\nspoke loudly and passionately about a\nmatter that was still inconclusive. In\ntheir words, it was as if we woo had\nviolated a heavenly law, and that the\ncharges against him had already been\nhanded down. If it were anyone else,\nthey would probably be so angry at these\nbookworms that their noses would be\ncrooked. However, Wayiu would only laugh\nat the scholars foolishness. They\ncompletely disregarded the unresolved\nissues they were discussing and instead\ncontinued to bring up Imperial Sensor\nHong since Imperial Sensor Hong is not\ndead. What kind of deathdeying\nremmonstrance is this? It's better to\nwait until he dies before talking about\nmy infamy. Furthermore, you accuse me of\nspreading heresy, researching strange\nand ingenious techniques, and neglecting\nto serve my country. Surely you have\naccomplished great things. In that case,\nwhy don't you recount your achievements\nand let everyone see just how glorious\nthey are. After we woo finished\nspeaking, the scholar who had spoken\nfirst spoke again. Although we students\nhave no merits, we have read the\nclassics know good and evil distinguish\nright from wrong and are learned. We\nwill all be pillars of the country in\nthe future. Haha. Upon hearing the\nscholars's words, Wayi Wu couldn't hold\nback this time and laughed on the spot.\nHe only stopped laughing when the\nscholars faces turned ashen from\nlaughing. I'm sorry. I don't usually\nlaugh like that unless someone says\nsomething so stupid that I can't help\nit. So, according to you, as long as one\nreads the classics, one can distinguish\nbetween good and evil, right and wrong,\nand will become a pillar of the nation\nin the future. Then let me ask you,\nwhich of the four great traitors of the\nSong Dynasty wasn't wellreed? Were they\nalso pillars of the state? Having said\nthat, Wayiu didn't give the other party\na chance to speak and continued. You\naccuse me of spreading heresy. Do you\nhave any evidence? Have you heard or\nseen anything? You're just a bunch of\nbookworms who've gone stupid from\nstudying too much. Calling you stupid is\ntoo kind. You should be called useless.\nYou can't even understand books and are\njust idiots who parrot what others say.\nHave you not heard Confucious say to\nhear something on the road and then\nrepeat it is to abandon virtue? Have you\nall figured out anything about what's\ngoing on around you? As he spoke, Wayi\nWu pointed directly to the cement road\nbeneath his feet. My concrete paved road\nis suitable for pedestrians, vehicles,\nhorses, and goods transport without the\nneed to worry about it becoming muddy or\nslippery when it rains. Even those\nmerchants you look down on can see the\nbenefits of this, but you only think\nabout how to attack me. At this point,\nWayi Wu casually pointed to a fat\nmiddle-aged man who looked wealthy.\nYou're a businessman, right? Come out\nand introduce yourself. The merchant\npointed at by Weii Wu immediately showed\nan excited expression. After emerging\nfrom the crowd, the merchant first bowed\nto the prince before speaking. Reporting\nto the Earl of Chong Lo. My name is\nHuang Tianfong. I have opened a\nstoneworkshop called Shan Shik Shuan in\nthe capital. Wayi Wu nodded and then\ncontinued to ask, \"Tell me, what's the\nsecret behind my cement?\" Huang Tion\nFong bowed slightly, looking at Wayi Wu\nwith a respectful expression and\nreplied. Reporting to Lord Chonglu, \"I'm\nnot familiar with cement, but I just\noverheard some people in the crowd\ntalking about some things. They said\nthere was no road here just a few days\nago, which means the road was built in\njust a few days. Therefore, I dare to\nguess that this material called cement\nhas the ability to complete construction\nquickly in a short time. At this point,\nHuang Tion Fong focused his gaze on the\nnine cement made characters. Moreover,\naccording to my observation, the Ming\nDynasty Royal Science and Technology\nResearch Institute is also made of a\nmaterial called cement. Presumably, this\nthing could be used not only for road\nconstruction, but also for building\nhouses and other structures. Perhaps it\ncan even be used for city walls. Clap\nclap clap clap. As soon as Hong Ton Fong\nstarted applauding him. Indeed, your\nobservation skills are very keen. You\ncan use them to build roads, houses, and\ncity walls. Cement is not only\ntime-saving and laborsaving, but also\nstronger than other materials, and it\nalso has extremely high plasticity.\nBecause it was originally just a powder,\nbut after adding water and sand and\nstirring it, it becomes like mud. At\nthis point, we woo raised his hand and\npointed to the nine large characters\nmade of cement. For example, these words\nwere made of cement, and after they\nsolidified, they became what they are\nnow. If you use it to build a house,\neven if there's a big fire, the house\nwill not be burned down or collapsed. At\nmost, you will lose some furniture and\nmiscellaneous items. Use it to build\nroads. And even if there is heavy rain,\nthere is no need to worry about mud, and\ncarriages can still travel normally.\nWhen used to build city walls, its\nadhesive strength is even stronger than\nthat of mortar and cement, making the\nwalls more solid and harder for the\nenemy to breach. If it is used to build\nflood control dikes, the banks of the\nriver will no longer have to worry about\nflooding farmland and crops. After\nexplaining the advantages of cement,\nWeii Wu turned his head again and looked\nsharply at the scholars. You bunch of\ngood for nothing say I'm spreading\nheresy, that I'm researching strange and\ningenious techniques, and that I don't\nthink about serving my country. I'd like\nto ask you a question. The things that\nthis research institute develops can not\nonly be used to build roads and houses,\nbut also to build cities and dikes. They\ncan be used in all aspects. But what\nabout you? Besides spreading rumors and\ncausing trouble, what contributions have\nyou made to the country? Or why do you\nhave to criticize me? I have studied\nthis cement and found it to be a\nmiraculous substance that can benefit\nthe country and its people. If you bunch\nof good for nothings were to become\nofficials, you would probably only harm\nthe country and its people. Chapter 162.\nNot paying a single penny, yet taking\nhalf the profits. Unlike those scholars,\nbecause of their social status, they\ncould only speak to Wayi Woo with veiled\nsarcasm and barbs. But Wayi Wu&lt;unk&gt;s\nrank and official position were far\nsuperior to those bookish fools. So, he\ndidn't hold back at all when he spoke\nand just started cursing. If there\nweren't so many people around and if he\ndidn't want to be seen as a shrew\ncursing in the street, Wayi Woo would\nhave sworn out even vulgarities\ninvolving organs. Those scholars were\ndirectly called useless by Wei Woo and\nthey didn't even have the chance to talk\nback. Just as we woo said they had not\ndone any in-depth research on the\nAcademy of Sciences before they came.\nNo, it can't be described as having an\nin-depth understanding because they\nsimply don't know what the Academy of\nSciences does. I just heard others say\nthat the Academy of Sciences was bad in\nthis way in that way. Plus the heroic\ndeeds Hang Lang had done. Therefore, in\ntheir minds, the Academy of Sciences\nnaturally became a place that brought\nBefore coming to the Academy of\nSciences, they had already prepared\ntheir story, intending to use their\nknowledge to ruin the academy and way\nWu's reputation. However, the result was\nthat he was scolded without being able\nto retaliate, especially in front of his\nhighness, the crown prince, and so many\nother people. The key point is that way\nWu has already presented the facts to\nhim. In just a few days, a smooth road\n30 ft long was built along with those\nnine large cement characters. These are\nundeniable facts, leaving them\nspeechless. Surrounded by onlookers, the\nscholars blushed and kept their heads\ndown, remaining silent. However, their\nsilence does not mean that we wu will\nlet them off so easily. Just as everyone\nwas looking at the scholar, weii Wu\nraised his voice again and announced,\n\"Everyone, does anyone recognize these\nthree people? Do you know their names?\"\nTo avoid any misunderstanding, Wu added\na sentence. Don't get me wrong. I asked\nfor their names not to cause trouble\nlater. It's not worth it for these few\ngood forno. Confucious once said, \"Repay\nevil with kindness.\" What will you repay\nkindness with? Repay evil with justice.\nRepay kindness with kindness. I'm the\nkind of person who will take revenge on\nthe spot if I have a grudge. Asking\ntheir names is simply a way to record\nwhat happened today and write into a\nbook in the future. At this point, Wayi\nWu chuckled and looked at the scholars\nagain. In this book, I will record what\nI see and hear and use the records of\nsome foolish, arrogant, and blind people\nas one of my materials. To warn future\ngenerations, I will print 100,000 to 1\nmillion copies of this book and give\nthem away for free without charging a\npenny. Never be foolish and ignorant\nlike the characters in the book.\nRemember the words of a sage. To spread\nhearsay is to abandon virtue. Upon\nhearing we woo&lt;unk&gt;s words, the scholars\nturned pale with fright and trembled\nuncontrollably. What do scholars care\nabout most? Name. A name that will be\nremembered in history. But what they\nfeared most was also fame. The kind of\nfame that would make them the\nlaughingtock of posterity. Just like\nwhat we woo is saying now. Once this\nbook is actually published, they will\nbecome a laughingtock of the world. The\nkey is we woos financial resources. If\nhe really want to do it, he definitely\ncould. Thinking about their future fate,\nthe scholars panicked, fearing that\ntheir names would be called out.\nHowever, who in this world doesn't have\none or two reliable enemies. Not long\nafter Wei Wu finished speaking, someone\nin the crowd immediately called out\ntheir names. Upon hearing their names\nbeing revealed, the scholars fainted on\nthe spot. Only the scholar who had\npreviously confronted Weii Wu still\nforced a pale face to look at Weii Wu.\nEarl of Chanlu, we are merely students.\nWhy do you and Earl make things\ndifficult for us common people? Looking\nat the stubborn guy in front of him, we\nwoo&lt;unk&gt;s eyes were full of disdain.\nTSK's cake. TSK. You were just calling\nyourself scholars and now you're just\ncommoners. You're nothing but commoners.\nAlso, who was making things difficult\nfor whom? Me or you? Who was it that\njumped out looking for trouble just now?\nDid I call you out? No wonder his\nmajesty set a rule that students are not\nallowed to discuss politics. The words\ncoming from your mouths are more foul\nthan dog At this point, Wayi Wu\nwas too lazy to bother with this fool\nwho was being used without even\nrealizing it. He waved directly at the\nsoldiers guarding the side. Men, throw\nthese good forno out of here and write\ndown their names. I said, I publish a\nbook and I mean it. Upon hearing we\nwoo&lt;unk&gt;s order, several soldiers\nimmediately came out and carried the\ndistraught scholar away. After they\nleft, Weii Wu continued speaking.\nOriginally, I wanted to give everyone a\ntour and introduce you to the various\nuses of cement so you could have a more\nintuitive understanding. Now that\neveryone knows the purpose of cement, I\nwon't repeat it. Let's just take a\ncasual look around. After speaking, Wayi\nWu took the lead and led Crown Prince Zu\nBao into the interior of the Science and\nTechnology Institute. Then the officials\nfollowed along with wealthy merchants\nand some of the selected citizens. Those\nwho couldn't get into the institute\ncould only wait helplessly outside. Upon\nentering the Academy of Sciences,\neveryone's eyes lit up. Everywhere you\nlook, there are smooth cement roads and\nornamental plants are planted on both\nsides of the roads. Then, with Wayi Woos\nexplanation, everyone was once again\namazed by the wonder of cement. These\nthings didn't exist 7 days ago. Yet, in\njust 7 days, they covered the entire\nscience institute with cement roads. As\neveryone observed and marveled, they\nsoon finished their tour of the Science\nand Technology Institute. After all,\nmany places within the Science and\nTechnology Institute are not open to the\npublic, and these people can only see\nthe roads. Once the tour was completely\nfinished, the crowd split into two\ngroups. Officials and commoners followed\nthe prince from the Academy of Sciences\nto the drill ground, preparing to visit\nthe next exhibition. The merchants, on\nthe other hand, were taken by Wei Wu to\nthe room where he usually had his\nclasses. At this point, the merchants\nhad some guesses, but they couldn't be\nsure. Fortunately, we didn't keep him in\nsuspense and gave the answer directly to\nthe wealthy merchants below the stage.\nLadies and gentlemen, you have all seen\nthe amazing properties of cement. Since\nthere will be a demonstration later, I\nwill keep it brief. Our institute plans\nto release the cement formula and find\nbusinessmen with sufficient financial\nresources to cooperate in the building\nmaterials business. However, we will\nonly provide the formula, not the money,\nand the profits will be split 50/50ths.\nThose who can accept this come to\nbehosing building tonight to discuss.\nAfter hearing what we woo said, the\nmerchants present all became hesitant.\nThe research institute provides the\nformula but doesn't invest any money and\nit also takes half of the profits. How\ncan I accept that? However, just as\neveryone was hesitating, Huang Tianfong\nthe merchant who had been mentioned by\nWayi Wu earlier spoke up. L Chonglu, I\nam very interested in cement. I will\ndefinitely go to the Behi Chowosing\nbuilding tonight to discuss this in\ndetail with you. In addition, I have a\nfew friends who are also wealthy\nbusinessmen. I wonder if I could bring\nthem along. Upon hearing this, we woo\nsmiled slightly. Of course, and I\nguarantee you and your friends won't\nregret it. Chapter 163. It's the\nfirearms team's turn to take the stage.\nUpon hearing we ws reply, Huang\nTianfing&lt;unk&gt;s face lit up with joy. In\nthat case, I thank W Chonglu on behalf\nof my friend for their help. None of the\nmerchants present expected Hong Ton Fo\nto be so decisive, and they couldn't\nhelp but wonder if he was Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s\nshill. However, while they were\nspeculating, they were unaware that Hang\nTon Foam was inwardly roaring with rage.\nGod help me. Everyone stay away from\nthis. Everyone stay away from this.\nRefuse it. Refuse it all. The reason why\nHang Ton had this mentality is simple.\nHe wanted to monopolize the cement\nbusiness. Just as these merchants\nsuspected, he was indeed a shill hired\nby Wei Wu. When Wayu approached him, he\nonly agreed to help because he couldn't\nrefuse due to his status. However, when\nwe wu revealed the uses of cement and\ndisclosed a little bit of information\nabout the imperial court, his mindset\nchanged. Having witnessed the wonders of\ncement firsthand today, Hang Ton foam\nwas completely captivated. The role of\nthe shill is to set up a trap to lure\nothers in. But deep down, this shill\nhopes that no one else will get\ninvolved. This is why we woo is standing\nhere. He has no choice but to bring\nothers into the game is agreed. If we\nwoo weren't around, he would have loved\nto spread rumors and drive everyone away\nto avoid them competing with him for\nbusiness. Unfortunately, things didn't\ngo as planned. Although most people\nhesitated, some still stepped forward\nand agreed. After all, people who can\nbuild a large business are not fools.\nThe uses of cement are obvious. Anyone\nwith a bit of business sense will think\nthings through. As for risks, what\nbusiness is without risks? After about\n10 minutes, about a third of the\nbusinessmen in the room expressed\ninterest in cement and he promised to go\nto the Beehive Chow building tonight to\nhave a detailed discussion with Wu.\nSeeing this, we wu smiled with\nsatisfaction. Very good. Your future\nselves will thank your present selves\nbecause this decision will bring you\nunimaginable wealth. Then let's head to\nthe drill ground. I'll show you what it\nmeans for product from the Academy of\nScience and Technology to be of the\nhighest quality. After saying this,\nWayiu did not give the merchants a\nchance to speak and turn to leave the\nclassroom. Upon seeing this, a group of\nbusinessmen immediately gave Chase,\nincluding those who were not involved in\nthe cement business. After all, it's not\na big deal to not do cement business,\nbut this kind of excitement is something\nwe don't see every year. Subsequently,\nled by Wei Woo, the group arrived at the\nmilitary camp and entered the training\nground without any hindrance. However,\nafter entering the training ground, the\nmerchants parted ways with Wayi Woo.\nWeii Wu went to the demonstration area\nin the middle of the training ground\nwhile the merchant was taken by soldiers\nto a special viewing area. Because they\nhad received the notice well in advance\nand because the military camp had\nsufficient manpower, the site was\ndivided into four areas long ago. A high\nplatform was erected to the north, a\nspot specifically reserved for Zu Yuan\nJang and Zuao. Grandstand were also\nbuilt on both the east and west sides to\nfacilitate viewing for officials,\nwealthy merchants and ordinary people.\nOnly the south side is open. There is no\nfence and people are not even allowed to\nstand there. This direction was\nspecifically reserved for firearms\ntesting. Viewers who had never\nexperienced anything like this before\nwere all eager to see what would happen\nnext. Even the officials were no\nexception. Full of curiosity about what\nachievements the Academy of Sciences\nwould present. The entire training\nground was filled with the sounds of\ndiscussion. However, just as everyone\nwas filled with anticipation, a sharp\nshout attracted everyone's attention.\nHis majesty has arrived. Upon hearing\nthis shout, everyone present bowed and\nknelt down. Only Zhu Bao and Weii Wu\nremained standing, making them stand out\nconspicuously. However, they also knew\nthat Weii Wu had special permission not\nto kneel. So even if they were\ndissatisfied, they could only suppress\ntheir feelings. Once Zhu Yuan Jang was\nseated on the high platform, he waved to\nsignal everyone to dispense with\nformalities. Then everyone stood up and\nZhu Yuan Jang turned to look at Wei Wu\nwith a smile. Lord Chonglu, we've\nbrought out the entire military camp as\nyou requested. Don't let us down now.\nUpon hearing this, Wayi Wu raised his\nhead high and responded loudly. Your\nMajesty, rest assured, I will not\ndisappoint you today and may even give\nyou a great surprise. All right, then\nshow us the surprise you've prepared.\nYes. After giving a casual reply, Wu\nturned around and suddenly waved his\nhand. The next second, 30 soldiers\narrived in the middle of the training\nground, forming three rows of 10\nsoldiers each. The soldier was also\nholding a strange object in his hand\nwhich looked like some kind of weapon.\nJust as the audience was filled with\nconfusion, Wayi Wu once again put the\nmegaphone to his lips. I'm sure everyone\nis curious about what weapons these\nsoldiers are holding and why they look\nso strange. Actually, at this point, we\nwoo deliberately paused, wetting the\nappetite of all the audience members.\nSeeing the expectant expressions on\ntheir faces, Wayi Wu finally spoke again\nafter a long while. Actually, even if I\nexplain it now, you won't understand.\nIt's better to wait until you see it\nwith your own eyes before I explain it\nto you. After saying this, Wayi Wu\ngestured with one hand, and the soldiers\nin the camp immediately began to move. A\ngroup of soldiers carried 10 wooden\nfigurines and placed them 50 ft away\nfrom the soldiers with guns. After\nplacing the puppets, the soldiers\nquickly withdrew to the edge of the\ntraining ground. It was only then that\npeople discovered that the doll was\nactually covered by a layer of cotton\narmor. Seeing this scene, the onlookers,\nwealthy businessmen, and some officials\nwere all completely baffled. Only the\nmilitary generals, and a small number of\ncivil officials who were familiar with\nthe battlefield could guess that we woo\nprobably wanted to demonstrate firearms.\nHowever, precisely because of this,\ntheir expressions became even more\npuzzled. Unable to understand what Weii\nWu was trying to do. They were all aware\nof the power of firearms. At most, they\ncould only operate at a distance of 30\nJeang, approximately 15 m, beyond which\ntheir lethality would decrease sharply.\nThe key issue is that no matter how\nskilled the soldiers are, they cannot\nguarantee accuracy. Whether they hit\nsomeone or not depends entirely on luck.\nBut these puppets were not only placed\n50 ft away, but they were also covered\nwith cotton armor. Although Weii Wu\ndidn't say it explicitly, anyone with a\nbrain could basically guess what he\nmeant. However, despite their guesses,\nthose present did not believe that Wayi\nWoo was capable of such a terrifying\nfeat. Is it possible to hit a puppet\nfrom 50 ft away and even to penetrate\nits leather armor and cause damage?\nCotton armor is not simply made of\ncotton cloth. There's also a layer of\niron plate inside the cotton cloth,\ngiving it considerable defensive\ncapabilities. Even within 30 jang, it\nwould be difficult for firearms to\npenetrate cotton armor, let alone beyond\n50 Jeang. At this moment, every official\nwho had some knowledge of firearms\nfrowned. Those officials who disliked\nWei Woo or even had grudges against him,\nsuch as Lee Shan Chong, were all waiting\nto see him make a fool of himself.\nMeanwhile, some officials with ulterior\nmotives had already prepared their\nstatements. They waited for Weii Wu to\nfail, then immediately petition the\nemperor to punish Wei Wu. Just then, Wei\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s voice rang out from the\ntraining ground. On your positions, take\naim and prepare to fire. Chapter 164.\nRifled flint lock musket plus mini\nbullet plus three-stage firing equals\ncavalry nemesis. Upon hearing Weii\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s order, the soldiers who were\nstanding in three rows immediately took\na step forward, alternating between left\nand right. The three rows of soldiers\nimmediately became a straight line, and\nthen they immediately picked up their\nflint lock musketss. Aiming at the\npuppet covered in cotton armor, who was\n50 ft away, he made a brief adjustment\nbefore decisively pulling the trigger.\nBang, bang, bang, bang. Amidst the thick\nsmoke from the burning gunpowder, a\nseries of gunshots rang out in the\ntraining ground. After firing, the\nsoldiers skillfully reloaded the flint\nlock musketss with gunpowder and\nbullets. Meanwhile, those watching from\nthe sidelines, especially those who knew\nabout firearms, all wore expressions of\nconfusion. They hadn't noticed it\nbefore, but now they finally realized\nsomething. These soldiers did not take\nout a tinder box to light their firearms\nwhen they fired. Have you noticed that\ntheir firearms seem to be able to fire\nwithout an open flame? That's right. I\nalmost forgot about it if you hadn't\nmentioned it. Why do they fire their\nweapons without lighting the fuse? It's\nprobably something special about that\nweapon. I took a closer look just now\nand they pulled a trigger on something.\nThat's not the point at all. Didn't you\nall notice that all those puppets 50 ft\naway were hit? Those who were originally\ndiscussing lighting the fire were\ninstantly drawn to this statement. Yes,\nthat's 50 Jeang. This weapon can not\nonly shoot that far, but it's also so\naccurate. Not only that, I listened\ncarefully just now. And when those\npuppets were hit, there was a sound of\nmetal clashing. The puppet is wearing\ncotton armor, isn't it? The sound of\nmetal clashing. Could it be that the\nmetal plates in the cotton armor could\nbe pierced through from a distance of 50\nft? All right, stop guessing. The\nsoldiers are already moving the puppets.\nWe'll see them up close when they\narrive. Just as this man said, the\nsoldiers had already begun their\noperation while they were talking. Three\nsoldiers formed a group and one of them\nremoved the cotton armor from the puppet\nand spread it out. The other two carry\nthe puppets to this side of the fence so\nthat the audience could see them up\nclose. The viewers, who were initially\njust curious, were all speechless with\nshock after seeing the result. Three\ndeformed metal bullets are clearly\nvisible on the puppet made of yellowish\nwhite wood. On the cotton armor held by\nthe other soldier, three holes were also\nclearly visible. This demonstrates just\nhow powerful the weapons the Academy of\nSciences showcased this time are. At a\ndistance of 50 ft, it not only\naccurately hit the target, but the\nbullet also penetrated the cotton armor\nand embedded itself in the wood. Even\nafter the soldiers carrying the puppets\nhad walked around the training ground\nonce, the audience was still in a\ndaysaze. Just then, Wayi Wu&lt;unk&gt;s voice\nrang out again. Gentlemen, you have all\nwitnessed the power of this firearm. So,\nlet me now introduce it to you. This is\nthe latest firearm developed by our\nRoyal Science and Technology Research\nInstitute of the Ming Dynasty. It is\ncalled a rifled flint lock musket, also\nknown as the cavalry killer. with it the\ncavalry that the northern tarters are so\nproud of will no longer be able to pose\na threat to our Ming soldiers. Cavalry\nkiller. Upon hearing this word, everyone\npresent showed expressions of doubt. Why\ndid we Woo dare to say that the rifled\nflint lock musket was the nemesis of\ncavalry. It's simple because it was the\ntruth. Firstly, the rifled flint lock\nmusket combined with mini ammunition has\na sufficiently long firing range. The\neffective range of a regular musket is\nonly 30 jang which translates to about\n100 m. Horses can run at a speed of 5 to\n7 m/s. At a speed of 7 m/s, a horse can\ncover a distance of 100 m in 14 seconds.\nIn 14 seconds, the best a musket can\nfire is two shots at most. Even with a\nthree-stage firing method, the reload\nspeed of the musket was still too slow\nto achieve effective firepower output.\nMoreover, lead bullets are not powerful\nenough. The first shot might not even\npenetrate the armor of cavalrymen. With\njust one charge, the enemy cavalry could\nclose in and slaughter the firearm\nsoldiers. But rifled flint lock guns are\ndifferent. When used with many bullets,\ntheir effective range can reach up to\n800 m. Even if we take a conservative\napproach and calculate based on an\neffective range of 500 m at a speed of 7\nm/s, it would take a horse at least 71\nseconds to traverse a distance of 500 m,\ntaking 50,000 cavalry as an example.\nOnly 1,000 flintlock musketss are needed\nto route them until they are routed and\nflee. According to the formation\nspecified by Chow Chow, the Ming\nDynasty's musketeers will use a\nthree-stage firing pattern to engage the\nenemy. However, instead of three people\ntaking turns firing, they exchange guns\nbut not personnel with one person firing\nand two people loading ammunition. This\nfiring method allows for three salvos to\nbe completed in less than 20 seconds. 71\nseconds is enough time for the\nmusketeers to fire 10 volleys. Even if\nonly half of the thousand flint lock\nmusketss fired simultaneously could kill\n500 enemy cavalrymen, it would still\nwipe them out. 10 volleys of fire equal\n5,000 cavalry, a number that may seem\nvery small, but this is only the most\nconservative estimate. In reality, a\nvolley of fire would cause no less than\n700 casualties. Furthermore, it should\nbe noted that if cavalrymen and their\nhorses fall together, it can cause a\ndomino effect. The cavalry behind them,\nunable to dodge in time, would also be\ntripped up and unable to launch an\neffective charge. Once the charging\nspeed slows down, the musketeers will\nhave more time to deal damage.\nMeanwhile, in ancient times, wars would\ncollapse if casualties exceeded 30%.\nEven without considering artillery, the\ndestructive effect would increase\nexponentially if both guns and cannons\nfired simultaneously. Seeing the doubts\non the audience's faces, Weii Wu smiled\nslightly and then explained, \"In the\npast, firearms had limited range and\npower and could only be fired when the\nenemy was within 30 ft.\" 30 Jeang is a\ndistance that can be covered in an\ninstant by a cavalry charge, but is\ndifferent for a rifled flint lock\nmusket. Even at a distance of 200 feet,\na rifled flint lock musket can exert\nextremely strong killing power, enough\nto kill the enemy. Weii Wu's words not\nonly failed to explain, but also made\nthem even more suspicious. 200 Jean,\nwhat does that mean? It's a distance of\nmore than a Lee, a unit of distance in\nChina. Although the scene of the flint\nlock gun shooting at the puppet was\nindeed very impressive, it was only 50\nft away after all. From the audience's\nperspective, although the spear was\npowerful, its maximum range was already\n100 Jong. Weii Wu actually said that it\ncould still maintain its power at 200\nJong. They would never believe it, even\nif they were beaten to death. So,\nshortly after Wei Wu finished speaking,\nsomeone in the audience immediately\nstood up. Interestingly, this person was\nnot a civil official who didn't get\nalong with Wei Wu, but rather a military\nnobleman. Lord Chonglu, I must admit\nthat the power of your firearms is\nindeed great. They're unprecedented\ndivine weapons. Once equipped, our Ming\narmy will be invincible. As a military\ngeneral, I thank you on behalf of the\nsoldiers. But you're saying that you can\nstill kill enemies even at a height of\n200 ft. I'm sorry, but I can't believe\nit. That's utterly absurd. After\nlistening to the general's words, we wu\nneither angry nor dissatisfied. After\nall, times have changed. For people of\nthis era, it is indeed a fantasy that\nfirearms could shoot that far. It's okay\nto have doubts. As long as we produce\nresults, the doubts will naturally\ndisappear, and we can prove them wrong.\nChapter 165. Questioning. Let the facts\nspeak for themselves. Before Wei Wu\ncould even present his achievements to\nprove them wrong, someone else jumped\nout and started causing trouble.\nMoreover, this time it wasn't military\ngenerals who jumped out, but several\ncivil officials. These civil officials\nwere originally thinking about how to\nbring up Wei Wu, but this military\ngeneral gave them a reason. A civil\nofficial stepped out from the crowd,\nbowed to Zhu Yuan Jang, and immediately\nbegan to speak. Your majesty, I believe\nthat what the Duke of Jang said is\nreasonable. After speaking, the civil\nofficial turned away Woo in the middle\nof the drill ground and loudly\nproclaimed in front of everyone, \"Lord\nJonglu, you are speaking so carelessly.\nYou must take responsibility for your\nwords. Otherwise, you will be suspected\nof deceiving the emperor.\" Duke of\nJeang. We didn't care at all about what\nthe civil official said. He was just a\nclown. What truly concerned him was the\ntitle of Duke of Jeang, which was Chong\nYuchin's puridge. But Chong Yuchin had\ndied long ago. So, the military general\nin front of us should be Chong Yachin's\nson, Chong Mao. But has Chong Mao lost\nhis mind? Why would he suddenly appear\nat this moment? Is he deliberately\npicking a fight with me? Or has he\nreally lost his mind and is just jumping\nout to get attention for no reason?\nWhile making guesses in his mind, Wayi\nWu carefully examined Chong Mao and then\nmade a decision in his heart. I'll have\nto talk to Lana later. If he doesn't\ndiscipline his own nephew, then I'll\nhelp him. As Wayi Wu was pondering this,\nanother civil official stood up as well.\nI second that. Firearms are powerful\nweapons on the battlefield and they are\nrelated to the lives and safety of our\nsoldiers. How can the Earl of Changangle\nmake such boastful remarks? If soldiers\nuse a distance of more than a mile as a\nbenchmark and then fail to keep up on\nthe battlefield, the consequences will\nbe unimaginable. After the second civil\nofficial finished speaking, the third\ncivil official also stood up. Your\nMajesty, I believe that the Earl of\nChangle's behavior is too frivolous and\nimpetuous, which is truly disgraceful\nfor a nobleman of the Ming dynasty. This\ntime, we still need to let him suffer a\nbit more to temper him so that Chong\nLebo can understand the immensity of\nheaven and earth and grow in the\nprocess. Let's take this as a warning.\nIf the Earl of Changel fails to live up\nto his word, we should temporarily strip\nhim of his title as a deterrent. When\nthe two civil officials were speaking,\nZhu Yuan Jang didn't even glance at\nthem. The previous expression was as if\nthey hadn't heard a word they were\nsaying, but this one was different. He\nhad barely finished speaking when Zhu\nYuan Jang&lt;unk&gt;s unwavering eyes fixed on\nhim. Are you teaching us how to do\nthings? When did it become your place to\ndecide whether to reward or punish us?\nOriginally, this civil official only\nstepped forward because the first two\npeople had spoken. Unexpectedly,\neveryone else was fine. But as soon as\nshe finished speaking, the emperor\nexpressed his dissatisfaction, and his\ntone was so cold. He was so frightened\nthat he immediately knelt down. \"Your\nMajesty, please forgive me. I dare not.\nAs an Imperial sensor, I have the duty\nto supervise all officials.\" I was\nshocked to see the Earl of Changangle be\nso frivolous. I spoke these presumptuous\nwords in a moment of anger. I had no\nintention of offending your majesty. I\nbeg your majesty's forgiveness. Upon\nhearing that the man's official title\nwas Imperial Sensor, Wei Wu, who had\nbeen watching the drama unfold from the\nsidelines, immediately understood, \"No\nwonder they targeted me like this. It\nturns out they were Huang Langs\ncolleagues.\" While watching the drama\nunfold, Wayiu secretly chuckled upon\nhearing the Imperial sensors words. If\nhe had simply admitted his mistake and\nsaid nothing else, the matter might have\nbeen over. Oldju wouldn't dwell on the\nmatter, but while admitting his mistake,\nhe would continue to make excuses,\nemphasizing his own official position\nand the correctness of his actions.\nIsn't that just trying to undermine Zhu\nYuan Jang? As expected, it was just as\nWeii Wu had guessed. As soon as the\nsensor finished speaking, Zhu&lt;unk&gt;s\nexpression became even more gloomy. So,\nyou mean we misunderstood you? Your\nmajesty. Your majesty dares not. Your\nmajesty, your majesty, I have something\nto say. Just as the sensor was about to\nsay something, we wu suddenly\ninterrupted him. Upon hearing Wei\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s voice, Zhu Yuan Jang also\nturned his gaze towards him. Unlike his\ncold gaze towards the sensor, Juuan\nJang&lt;unk&gt;s look towards Weii Wu was much\ngentler. Wii Wu, what do you have to\nsay? Speak. Upon hearing this, we\nwu&lt;unk&gt;s lips curled into a smile and\nthen he spoke. Your Majesty, I believe\nthe sensor is right. If I spoke\ncarelessly, I should indeed be punished\naccordingly. However, I also feel that\nthis sensor is frivolous and impetuous,\nmaking hasty conclusions without\nverifying the facts, which is not the\nbehavior of a virtuous minister.\nTherefore, I agree with what he said and\nwill take this as a warning. If I fail\nto live up to what I said, I will strip\nhim of his title. But if I do what I\nsaid, then shouldn't this sensor also be\nstripped of his official position and\ndemoted to a commoner? At this point,\nWayi Wu paused for a moment, then looked\nat the two people who had spoken\nearlier. And these two officials were\nfar too frivolous and impetuous just\nnow. Let them take this as a warning.\nAfter hearing Wu&lt;unk&gt;s words, Zhu Yuan\nJang almost burst out laughing.\nFortunately, as an emperor, he was quite\nadept at managing his expressions and\nmanaged to suppress his smile. All\nright, we think you make a good point,\nso we'll agree to it. The two officials,\nwho had initially been relieved that\nthey were unharmed, immediately looked\nmuch more miserable upon hearing these\nwords. I studied hard for years and\nfinally got to where I am today. Now,\nbecause of a single sentence, he has to\ngamble his official career and future.\nHe must be feeling incredibly bitter.\nBut they dared not express any descent\nagainst Ju Yuan Jang. Instead, they\nlooked at Wayi Wu with eyes that seemed\nto want to devour him. Unfortunately, we\nwould didn't take their opinions\nseriously at all. Without even glancing\nat them, he turned around and began\narranging the next experiment. It's\nlaughable really. The range test of the\nrifle flint lock musket was actually\npart of the demonstration. Therefore,\nthe soldiers who took up the guns\ntrained their marksmanship almost day\nand night during this period. 80% of the\nmany bullets produced these days have\nbeen used by Wei Woo for shooting\npractice. With the scope removed from\nthe M4A1, even if you can't say you'll\nhit the bullseye every time, you can\nstill manage five out of 10 shots. After\nall, a puppet isn't a bullseye target.\nThere's no need to calculate the rings,\nlet alone care about vital points or the\ncenter. As long as the bullet hits the\ntarget, that's fine. Next, under Way\nWoos command, the 10 puppets were moved\nup by the soldiers again. To ensure his\npoint, he deliberately marked the bullet\nholes on the puppet with a red pen.\nThen, after about 10 minutes, the puppet\nwas placed at a distance of about 200\nft. Fortunately, the drill ground is\nusually used for soldiers training, so\nthere's no need to worry about the space\nbeing insufficient. After setting up the\ntargets, the soldiers brought over some\nstrange tables. What's strange is that\nthese tables are almost up to the\nsolders's chests. The audience was a\nlittle stunned, wondering what these\ntables were for. Just as they were\ncompletely confused, Wayi Woo suddenly\nspoke up. On your positions, aim your\nweapons. Out of command, the soldiers\nuniformly took out A-frame stands and\nplaced the flint lock rifles on the\ntable. Bipod. It can improve the\naccuracy and stability of long barrel\nguns. Chapter 166. Duke of Jang. Is that\nit? Is what I said still absurd? Wayi\nWoo put a lot of effort into this\npresentation of his achievements.\nScopes, bipods, firing platforms,\neverything was fully prepared for the\nsoldiers. Even these armed soldiers were\nspecially selected by him from the\nfirearms battalion. They were all\nsoldiers who were the best at using hand\ncannons. When 30 soldiers lined up in\nfront of everyone, intently taking aim,\nwithout weu even having to say a word,\nthe entire training ground automatically\nfell silent. Everyone watched the\nsoldiers intently awaiting the final\nresult. The difference is that most\npeople hoped they hit their target, like\nZu Yuan Jang and Jubiao. As they watched\nthe soldiers take aim, both men\ninstinctively gripped the armrests of\ntheir seats. Of course, there were also\na few people who hoped the soldiers\nwould fail, such as the officers who\nspoke earlier. There's also Lee Shan\nChong and those with ulterior motives.\nThe next second, under the watchful eyes\nof everyone, the first soldier\ndecisively pulled the trigger. Bang.\nAfter a gunshot rang out, the soldier\nwho fired the shot looked away from his\nscope. At the same time, a subtle smile\nappeared on his lips. People far away\ncertainly couldn't see it, but Weii Wu,\nwho was standing next to him, noticed\nit. Unsurprisingly, the soldier must\nhave seen himself hit the target through\nthe scope. After the first shot was\nfired, the soldiers behind are not to be\noutdone and pulled their triggers one\nafter another. In the following time, a\nsoldier fired a shot every one to two\nseconds. About a minute later, all the\nsoldiers had completed their shooting\nmission. 70% of them had smiles on their\nfaces while only 30% looked dejected,\nclearly having missed the target.\nInstead of reprimanding them, we woo\npatted them on the shoulder to encourage\nthem. In fact, just one bullet hitting\nthe target is enough to prove the firing\nrange of a rifled flintlock musket. Not\nto mention that now 70% of the soldiers\nhave hit their targets, which is enough\nto completely slap those who have doubts\nin the face. Interestingly, Wayi Wu was\nable to see the expressions on the\nsoldiers faces because he was so close.\nBut the spectators in the stands\ncouldn't see that. They could only see\nthe soldiers standing there\nexpressionless. Weii Wu patted them on\nthe shoulders as if saying something\nencouraging. This scene also gave hope\nto those civil officials. Just as\neveryone was waiting expectantly, the\nsoldiers in the military camp had\nalready run towards the puppet. Then,\nnot long after, the puppets were brought\nback. Because the puppet wasn't wearing\nany cotton armor this time, the changes\nin its appearance were very clear. As\nthe soldiers carried the puppets past\nthe audience, everyone stared in\ndisbelief. In addition to the red\nmarkings drawn by Weii Woo, each puppet\nhad several bullet holes. Last time they\ncould see the bullet itself, but this\ntime all they could see was a black\nhole. This proves that the bullet\npenetrated the puppet's interior and\nalso proves that the rifled flint lock\nmusket was indeed lethal at 200 ft. As\ntime passed, the soldiers carried the\npuppet around the training ground. After\neveryone had verified it, Zhu Yuan Jang,\nwho was sitting on the stage, spoke\nagain. Guards, remove the official robes\nand hats from Liku, Ziao, Jia, and Zha.\nFrom this day forward, they shall be\ndemoted to commoners. Also, throw those\nthree out. We don't want to see these\ndisgraceful bastards again. Upon hearing\nZhu Yuan Jong&lt;unk&gt;s order, the three men\nimmediately tried to kneel down and beg\nfor mercy. However, before they could\nact, they found that a hand had\ninexplicably covered their mouth for\nbehind. In fact, Zhu Yuan Jang had\nalready ordered people to wait behind\nthese people when they made the bet with\nWei Wu. Zhu Yuan Jang knew very well\nwhat kind of person Wei Wu was. Others\nmight not know, but he certainly did.\nThis guy never fights a battle he's not\nconfident of winning. If he's talking,\nhe must be absolutely certain of\nvictory. So, they arranged for people to\nwait in advance so that the three\nofficials wouldn't make a scene and\nannoy everyone if they lost. As it\nturned out, old Jews foresight brought\nhim much needed peace and quiet. At this\nmoment, the three civil officials were\nleft with no way out and could only be\ndragged away from the training ground.\nThroughout this process, Weii Wu didn't\neven bother to glance at them. Only\nafter the three had been completely\ntaken away from the training ground did\nwe woo raise the megaphone and continue\nspeaking. Gentlemen, you have all seen\nthe power of the rifled flintlock\nmusket. It still has great killing power\nat a distance of 200 ft. After speaking\nof wei Wu, this is the Duke of Jang,\nisn't it? You can rest assured now. It\nhas been proven that what I said was not\nabsurd. After being stung by Wei\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s words, Duke Chong Mao of Ciangs\nface turned extremely ugly. He even\nstarted thinking about how to teach Weu\na lesson after this matter was over.\nHe's just a mere earlied a princess.\nYet, he dares to speak to a duke like\nthat. Unfortunately, Chong Mao was\nunaware that Lan Yu had witnessed his\nentire performance. At this moment, even\nbefore Wei Wu could approach him for a\nchat, Lu was already glaring at Chong\nMao through gritted teeth. and he was\nalso thinking about what would be more\nconvenient to use. Others may not know\nthe significance of a marquee of\nChonglu, but Lan Yu, a staunch supporter\nof the crown prince, knows it better\nthan anyone else. To put it bluntly, if\nCrown Prince Yu Bao had to choose\nbetween him and Chow Chowo, it would be\na difficult choice. Without a second\nthought, Lon would have simply slid his\nown throat with a knife because there\nwas no comparison. He had to be very\ncareful in befriending Wei Wu. So what\nwas Chong Mao compared to him?\nAdmittedly, Chong Mao's hereditary\ndupdom is far more prestigious than Lu's\nmarquee. However, in terms of seniority,\nLanu is the maternal uncle. As the\nsaying goes, the maternal uncle is the\ngreatest relative to one's mother, and\nthe Ming dynasty govern the country with\nfilop piety in mind. If Lan Yu is going\nto make a move, even Duke Chong Mao will\nhave to obediently accept the beating.\nIt won't matter who else you ask. Just\nas Lan Yu and Chong Mao were pondering\ntheir own thoughts. Weii Wu standing in\nthe middle of the training ground spoke\nup again. At a distance of 200 Jang,\neven if cavalry charge at full speed, it\nwould take at least a tenth of the time\nit takes to brew a cup of tea to get\nclose. At this distance, using a rifled\nflint lock musket, combined with my\nthree-stage firing formation specially\ndesigned for this type of musket, our\nsoldiers can fire 13 volleys before the\nenemy cavalry gets close, killing them\nfrom a distance. Next, I'll have the\nsoldiers demonstrate what a three-stage\nfiring battle formation is. After saying\nthat, we woo waved his hand and the 30 m\nlong soldiers immediately returned to\ntheir original formation. 10 soldiers\nsquatted in the front row with two armed\nsoldiers standing behind each soldier.\nBut instead of setting up their guns,\nthey placed the flint lock pistols in\nthe most convenient position.\nSubsequently, three cages were placed in\nan open area about 100 John south of the\ndrill ground. Upon closer inspection,\nthe audience realized that the cage\ncontained three ferocious wild boars.\nAfter the cage door was opened, three\nwild boores shook their heads and ran\nout of the cage. As soon as they came\nout, they immediately set their sights\non the 30 soldiers wielding flintlock\nmusketss. The wild boar let out a roar\nand bellowed, then charged wildly toward\nthem. At the same time, the soldiers\npulled the triggers. Chapter 1 167. The\nflint lock musket falls. The breach\nloading cannon takes center stage. Bang,\nbang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang,\nbang, bang, bang. As the wild boar\ncharged forward with ferocious strides,\n10 explosive gunshots rang out. The many\nbullets shot out from the muzzle,\ncutting through the air and creating\nbullet holes in the wild boar's body.\nHowever, this round of shooting did not\ninflict fatal wounds on the wild boars.\nInstead, it provoked their ferocity.\nBecause of the bullet wounds, the three\nwild boares not only roared louder, but\nalso ran faster. He longed to rush to\nthe soldiers and tear those two-legged\nbeasts who had harmed him to shreds.\nHowever, the 30 soldiers showed no sign\nof panic when faced with these three\nferocious beasts. The soldiers in the\nfront row calmly and quickly passed the\nflint lock pistol behind them and took\nthe second pistol from their comrades.\nAfter a brief aiming maneuver, gunfire\nrang out once more. Wild boars run a\nlittle faster than horses, but their\nstarting speeds are about the same. A\ndistance of 300 m would take a wild boar\nat least 35 seconds to cross. 35 seconds\nis enough time for the soldiers to fire\nfive volleys. Although wild boars have\nthick skin and cover themselves in mud\nto enhance their defense after it dries.\nOne or two bullets from a regular\nfirearm won't cause much damage, but\nthey can't withstand continuous fire.\nMoreover, the many bullets used by the\nsoldiers were steel core bullets that\nYong Chow had improved. Its power is\nincomparable to that of ordinary minor\nmissiles. Under the soldiers volley of\nfire, the three wild boars couldn't even\nwithstand the fourth volley. In the\nthird round, he was riddled with bullet\nholes and collapsed to the ground,\nbleeding profusely. Seeing the fate of\nthe three wild boars, all the onlookers\nbecame excited. As is wellknown, wild\nboars are notorious for their thick skin\nand meat and for being extremely\naggressive. Most people who go into the\nmountains are harmed by them. In its\nberserk state, a wild boar's charge\nspeed is no slower than that of cavalry,\nand its defensive capabilities far\nsurpass those of cavalry. But these\nthree wild boars in front of them\ncouldn't even get close to the attack of\nthese firearms. Such divine weapons, if\nused against cavalry, would make killing\nthe enemy as easy as cutting melons and\nvegetables. While everyone was still\nreeling from the power of the rifled\nflintlock musket, the wild boar carcass\non the field had already been cleared\naway. Judging from the smiles on the\nsoldiers faces, it's no surprise that\nthe military camp will be having an\nextra meal of a whole pig tonight. At\nthe same time, Wayi Wu looked towards Yu\nYu and Jong&lt;unk&gt;s location and said,\n\"Your majesty, the manufacturing process\nof rifled flint lock musketss is quite\ncomplicated, and for the time being,\nonly the Academy of Science and\nTechnology has the capability to produce\nthem. However, this will be resolved\nsoon. I will then hand over the\nmanufacturing method to the Ministry of\nWorks, and her majesty will decide\nwhether to equip the entire army with\nit. In fact, Wayi Wu wasn't exaggerating\nwhen he said that. After all, the steam\nengine had already been invented, and it\nonly needed a little design to be used\nfor rifling. The blade itself isn't\ndifficult to make. With the current iron\nsmelting technology of the Ming Dynasty,\nit's entirely possible to produce\nhigh-carbon steel. After just a few\ntempering processes and quenching with\nbrine, the hardness is sufficient to\nmake it suitable for use as a cutting\ntool. The only problem is that there\nwill be more losses. With steam engines\nreplacing manpower, it won't be a\nproblem whether it's iron smelting or\nanything else. Upon hearing Wu&lt;unk&gt;s\nwords, Zhu Yuan Jang, who was sitting on\na high platform, also smiled. Resolve\nthis problem as soon as possible and\nequip an invincible army as quickly as\npossible. Yes. Weii Wu chuckled and was\nabout to speak when Juian Jang spoke\nfirst. You've made such a big commotion\nthis time. It can't just be about flint\nlock guns. There must be other good\nstuff here. Bring out all the good stuff\nyou've prepared. Let's see how many\nsurprises we have in store. Wayi Wu was\noriginally preparing to proceed with the\nnext demonstration, but Juu Yuan Jang\nspoke up first. Upon hearing this, Wayi\nWu immediately laughed. You really can\nsee through anything. That's right.\nBesides the flint lock musket, I also\nhave two newly developed cannons to show\nyou. After speaking, Wayi Wu turned\naround and looked at a corner of the\ntraining ground. Seeing Wayi Wu&lt;unk&gt;s\nactions, everyone followed his gaze only\nto see three things covered with red\ncloth. Because it was covered by a red\ncloth, no one knew what was hidden\nunderneath. Just then, Wayi Wu&lt;unk&gt;s\nvoice rang out again from the training\nground. Bring the artillery up. As soon\nas Wayi Wu finished speaking, the\nsoldier standing next to the red cloth\nimmediately grabbed it and ripped it\noff. Two of the three pieces of red\ncloth were lifted, revealing cannons\nhidden underneath. The long cylindrical\ncannon was placed on a two- wheeled gun\ncarriage and pushed to the middle of the\ndrill ground by the soldiers. Your\nMajesty, our Academy of Science and\nTechnology, has recently developed two\ntypes of artillery, namely heavy\nartillery and light artillery, each with\ndifferent functions. Heavy artillery is\npowerful but inconvenient to move. It\ncould be used to defend city gates and\nkey roads while light artillery can be\ncarried by the army to kill the enemy.\nAs he spoke, Wayi Wu walked directly to\nthe breach loading cannon. Let me first\nintroduce this light cannon to you. It\ncomes in six sizes, but for now we have\nonly produced one large and one small.\nAs he spoke, Wayi Wu pointed to the\nlarger breach loading cannon. This is\nthe largest type of artillery with a\nmaximum range of four miles and it is\nvery easy to load gunpowder and shells.\nIt can be said that in terms of power,\nfiring efficiency and mobility, it is\nmuch stronger than today's heavy\nartillery. Originally, the range of the\nlarge breach loading cannon was only\nabout 2 mi or about 1,300 m, but that's\nbecause the air tightness is too poor,\nso it can't unleash its full power.\nHowever, with the machine tools and\nmicrometers provided by Wei Woo, plus\nthe threaded ceiling design, the air\ntightness problem no longer exists.\nAfter introducing the large breach\nloading cannon, Weii Woo pointed to the\nsmaller one. This small breach loading\ncannon has a range of about 1 m and 90\nft. It is lightweight and extremely\nconvenient to carry during marches.\nSimilarly, by improving the air\ntightness, the range of the small breach\nloading cannon was increased from 500\nmeters to 900 meters. Even we woo had to\nadmit that the power of industry was\ntruly immense. After introducing the two\ntypes of breach loading cannons, we woo\nadded a special sentence. There is also\na smaller one which can even be picked\nup and fired by soldiers and can be used\nin environments such as mountains, patty\nfields, and forests. Due to time\nconstraints, we only produced these two\nsizes, but that's enough for the\ndemonstration. After listening to Wei\nWoos detailed explanation, they learned\nabout the various specifications of the\nbreach loading cannon. Zhu Yuan Jang was\nincredibly excited. His body was\npounding and his face flushed. He even\ndisregarded Imperial dignity, standing\nup and waving his hand. Test the cannon\nimmediately. As soon as Zu Yuan Jang\nfinished speaking, the unic standing\nnext to him immediately shouted. His\nmajesty commands that the cannons be\ntested immediately. With the emperor's\norder, the soldiers in the camp did not\ndare to hesitate and immediately sprang\ninto action. Soon, the cannons of the\ntwo breach loading cannons were loaded\nwith gunpowder and shells. At the same\ntime, the cannons were also aimed at the\nonly uninhabited area on the south side\nof the training ground. Chapter 168.\nAfter a few shots, the onlookers were\nall excited. The method of testing the\nbreach loading cannon was the same as\nthat of the flint lock musket. A gunner\nwas accompanied by two assistants who\nloaded gunpowder and shells into the\ncannon. After all preparations were\ncompleted, the gunners began to adjust\nthe sights and rear sights, aiming them\nat the distant target. It was only then\nthat the audience noticed that a mud\nwall made of mud bricks had appeared\nabout a mile away. After calibration,\nthe gunners squatted beside the cannon\nwith torches, waiting for orders. Then,\nWayi Wu shouted, \"Fire! Boom!\" The awe\ninspiring sound of artillery fire\nerupted from the drill ground. As the\nsmoke billowed, a hole was instantly\npierced through the earthn wall a mile\naway. But that wasn't the end of it.\nAfter the shell pierced through the\nearthn wall, it continued to fly for\nseveral dozen more feet. When the\ncannonballs landed, large clouds of dust\nwere thrown up and scattered. Although\nthe trajectory of the shells was\nunclear, the final result was visible to\nthe audience. Ordinary people might just\nbe watching the spectacle, but Zu Yuan\nJang and his military generals could see\nthe underlying principles. The Ministry\nof Works had produced large iron cannons\na few years earlier, which had greatly\nshocked Ju Yuan Jang and his entourage.\nJudging from the results, Weiiwoo's\nbreach loading cannon is actually\nseveral times more powerful than the old\niron cannon. Keep in mind that the small\nversion of the breach loading cannon in\nfront of us is less than half the size\nof the large iron cannon. Just as Yu\nYuan Jang was overjoyed, and the\nonlookers were shocked. The artillery\nmen did not stop. He took the cannon out\nof the cannon's belly and threw it\naside. Then took the second cannon from\nthe assistant and loaded it. Boom. In\njust a breath or two, the breach loading\ncannon roared again. Another hole\nappeared in the earth and wall a mile\naway. And then a third cannon shot rang\nout not long after. This time the earthn\nwall could no longer hold on and\ncollapsed after being pierced by the\nshell. Three shots fired in such a short\ntime. And with such power, this cannon\nis truly a divine weapon for conquering\ncities and seizing strongholds. If this\ncannon is used in conjunction with flint\nlock musketss, the Yuan Mongol cavalry,\nwhich they're so proud of, will be\nnothing but clay chickens and earthn\ndogs on the battlefield. Seeing the\npower and firing rate of the breach\nloading cannon, Zhu Yuan Jangs eyes\nwidened, and he muttered to himself. In\nfact, it wasn't just Zhu Yuan Jang, Zhu\nBao, and all the civil and military\nofficials were also dumbfounded when\nthey saw such a divine weapon. But this\nwas just the beginning. While everyone\nwas still in shock in the training\nground, the gunner along with two\nsupport personnel had already come to\nthe large breach loading cannon to\nprepare. The large breach loading\ncannons had a long range and no matter\nhow they were adjusted, they could not\nachieve accurate firing. Therefore,\nWayiu did not set up any target this\ntime, but simply instructed the gunners\nto aim at the distance. Then he\nimmediately ordered the gunners to light\nthe fuse. Boom. Boom. Boom. In just\nabout 20 seconds, three cannonballs were\nfired from the muzzle and flew into the\ndistance. Although there was no target\nas a reference, it was impossible to\ndirectly experience the power of the\nlarge Franconian cannon. However, some\nclues can still be gleaned from the\nresults after the cannon fire. After the\niron cannonball flew out of the muzzle,\nit quickly covered a distance of 2 or 3\nm. Even if you can't see the trajectory\nof a shell, you can still see the damage\nit causes. Because after the artillery\nfired, several large trees several miles\naway inexplicably broke off and fell\ndown. And after each shot was fired, the\nsound of trees breaking could be seen.\nEven without the obvious presence of an\nearthn wall, this is enough to\ndemonstrate the power of the Fronn's\nbreach loading cannon. Therefore,\nimmediately after the shells were fired,\nsome clever officials jumped out. Your\nMajesty, I congratulate you. With this\ndivine cannon in hand, marching north to\nconquer the Yuan and pacifying the\nSouthwest will be as easy as turning\nyour palm. No country in the world can\nrival my great Ming. My great Ming will\nsurely shine like the sun and moon\nforever. Its majesty will be known\nthroughout the four seas, and all\ndirections will submit to its rule. A\nconspicuous bag popped up and all the\nother civil and military officials\nreacted and offered their\ncongratulations. As the saying goes,\n\"Flattery will get you through\nanything.\" And this time, the officials\nreally hit the mark with their flattery.\nZhu Yuan Jang laughed hardily after\nhearing this and even stood up. Aha,\nvery good. May the Ming dynasty be\nforever secure and may all officials\nshare the fate of a nation. After\nresponding to the civil and military\nofficials, Zhu Yuan Jang turned to look\nat Wayi Wu. Uncle Chong Lo, you said the\nAcademy of Science and Technology has\ndeveloped two types of artillery. Show\nus the other one. Yes, your majesty. We\nWoo casually replied and then\nimmediately arranged for someone to push\nthe redcoated cannon over. Because of\nits lighter barrel, the breach loading\ncannon only required two people to move\nit. But this red cannon weighs a\nwhopping 2,500 gene, approximately 1,250\nkg. Even with the frame in place, it\ntakes four soldiers to push it to the\ndesignated location. When the soldiers\ntore off the red cloth covering the\ncannon, the red clothed cannon finally\nrevealed its ferocious nature. The thick\nblack cannon barrel gradually widens,\nbut even the narrowest muzzle is about\nthe size of a human head. The thickest\npart of the brereech is several times\nlarger, and there are two rings of rim\non the middle of the brereech. Under the\nsunlight, the entire cannon gleamed with\na cold metallic sheen, sending chills\ndown one spine. The cannon barrel is\nangled upwards, as if declaring its\nintention to blast a hole in the sky.\nWhile everyone was still in awe of the\ngiant cannon, the soldiers began their\npreparations. Gunpowder is loaded from a\nmuzzle and then compacted thoroughly\nwith a push rod. Immediately afterwards,\ntwo soldiers struggled to stuff a\nfootball-sized iron cannonball into the\nmuzzle of the cannon. The sheer size of\nthe shell was enough to make the\nonlookers gasp in shock. The shells used\nby that breach loading cannon were only\nabout the size of an adult's fist. And\nthese cannonballs are so much bigger. If\none of them were fired, how terrifying\nwould the power be? Just as everyone was\nspeculating, the red cannon team had\nalready completed the final step. A thin\nfuse was inserted into the breach of the\ncannon by the gunner. Once the artillery\nmen holding torches were crouching\nbeside the cannon, Weii Wu finally\nspoke. To let everyone see the power of\nthis red cannon with their own eyes, our\ninstitute specially manufactured a\nbursting shell. After a regular iron\ncannonball is fired, it uses its own\nhardness and force to smash everything\nin its path to pieces. But unlike\ncannonballs, exploding shells are not\nused to hit people, but rather they\nexplode after hitting the target. Upon\nhearing Wu mention using exploding\nshells, the expressions of many generals\nin the audience changed. Even Ju Yuan\nJang and Juao, who were sitting on the\nstage, couldn't help but stand up and\ntry to stop them. However, Wayiwood did\nnot give Zu Yuan Jang a chance to speak.\nSeeing that the gunners were all ready,\nwithout the slightest hesitation, they\nimmediately shouted, \"Fire! Boom!\" A\ndeafening roar rang out, and the shell\nwas ejected from the cannon barrel at a\nspeed too fast for the naked eye to\nperceive. 1 mile early, suddenly, the\nshells continued to fly, eventually\nhitting a small hill 5 m away from the\nfiring point. Boom!\nAs a burst of fire exploded, the sound\nand explosion also echoed back from\nafar. Chapter 169. One wave subsides,\nanother rises. Why were Zu Yuan Jang and\nZhu Bao prepared to speak up and stop\nthem? They knew about exploding shells,\nbut these shells were not very practical\nand were too dangerous. In fact, there\nwere already prototypes of exploding\nbullets as early as the Song Dynasty.\nAnd naturally, the Ming dynasty, which\nvalued firearms, also produced them.\nHowever, the timing of the shell's\ndetonation was unpredictable, so it\nfailed to become mainstream. Before\nfiring artillery, the fuse of the shell\nmust be lit first and then the shell can\nbe fired. Because the explosion occurs\nduring the firing process, it is\nimpossible to accurately calculate the\ntime of explosion. It's very likely that\nthe shell will explode before it even\nhits the ground. Or even if it does, it\nmight extinguish the fuse, but that's\nstill relatively good. The real problem\nis the risk of the barrel exploding.\nManually igniting a fuse carries a high\ndegree of uncontrollable risk. For\nexample, if there's a problem with the\nfiring of the cannon after the fuse of\nthe shell is lit, resulting in a firing\ndelay, the shell may explode in the\nbarrel. In addition to the fuse, the\nchamber pressure in the gun barrel is\nalso a very critical issue. The reason\nwhy heavy artillery can shoot far is\nbecause of the high temperature gas\nproduced after the gunpowder is ignited.\nIn the enclosed space of the gun barrel,\nhigh pressure gas is generated to propel\nthe projectile out. This is known as\nchamber pressure. To make a shell\npowerful enough, it must be loaded with\na large amount of gunpowder, which means\nthe shell's casing cannot be too thick.\nIf it's too thick, there's not enough\ngunpowder, and the explosive power is\nless than that caused by the impact of a\nsolid shot. It was too thin, so there\nwas too much gunpowder, but the iron\ncasing couldn't withstand the chamber\npressure, and it exploded inside the\nbarrel before it was even fired. Ancient\npeople did not understand chamber\npressure. So, they attributed all\nchamber explosions to the uncontrollable\nnature of exploding shells. However,\nmost barrel explosions are actually\ncaused by the shell being unable to\nwithstand the chamber pressure. Zhu Yuan\nJang and his son were worried that the\ncannonballs would explode, which is why\nthey wanted to stop Wei Wu Chow Chow\nfrom being in danger. Fortunately,\nnothing went wrong. The artillery was\nfired successfully, and the effect was\nparticularly amazing. As all the\nspectators were drawn to the fire light,\na sentence suddenly popped out from the\ncrowd. That looks like Panchching\nMountain. This one sentence immediately\nsparked discussion among the people\naround. That's right. That's Pansing\nMountain. It's about 10 miles away from\nhere. How come these cannons can hit\nthat far? Wrong. 10 Lee is a long detour\nfor us to walk there. These shells fly\nover there. It's not that far. Most 5\nLee 5 mi is far enough. And these\ncannons can explode. If this were on a\nbattlefield, wouldn't a lot of people\ndie? A large area. You should take a\ncloser look. The rock face of Panchching\nMountain has been blasted into a huge\ncrater. A large area probably isn't\nenough. Indeed, just as these people are\nsaying, after the shells exploded, a\nlarge section of Panching Mountain was\nblasted out. In fact, not only the\naudience members, but even we woo was\nshocked. Because of the chamber pressure\nissue, he had to make the metal casing\nof the exploding bullet thicker to\nprevent it from exploding. However, to\nensure its power, he added sugar to the\ngunpowder in the shells. He originally\njust wanted the power to look\nterrifying, but the actual effect far\nexceeded his expectations. One part\nsulfur, two parts salt peter, three\nparts charcoal, add a little sugar, and\nthe Ivan the Great. The netzens were\nright. Looking at the huge pit on\nPanchching Mountain, Weii Wu couldn't\nhelp but feel a deep sense of awe. Next,\nwe woo gave a special demonstration of\nthe improvements made to gunpowder by\nthe Academy of Sciences. To maximize the\ncomparison effect, he used the original\nproportions from the Ministry of\nIndustry. On the other hand, they used\nthe standard gunpowder formula and added\nwhite sugar to the gunpowder. Boom.\nBoom. With two loud explosions, the\ndemonstration of achievements on the\ntraining ground came to an end. Even as\nthe audience walked out of the training\nground, they still had a sense of\nlingering enjoyment on their faces.\nThose officials were all right, but it\nwas mainly the wealthy merchants and\nordinary people who were affected. If it\nweren't for the Academy of Scienc's\npublic demonstration, they probably\nwould never have seen such a spectacular\nscene in their lifetime. In fact, there\nare two things about firearms that we\nwoo did not show. Hand grenades and\nlandmines. The main reason is that these\ntwo things are not suitable for public\ndisplay since no one knows whether there\nare Yuan Mongol spies among these\npeople. If such weapons do exist, it\nwould be bad if the enemy were prepared\nfor them in the future. Therefore, these\ntwo items were hidden away so that they\ncould be used to launch a surprise\nattack during the Northern Expedition.\nAt that time, we can use artillery to\nattack from a distance, flint lock\npistols to kill enemies at medium range,\nand grenades to get close. They could\neven set up a minefield in front of the\nranks and things would get interesting\nwhen the enemy cavalry got close.\nTherefore, always having a backup plan\nis the key to success. After leaving the\ndrill ground, the people full of\nanticipation immediately headed towards\nthe riverbank. After the firearms\ndemonstration, they're now incredibly\nexcited to see what else they'll see.\nAnyway, the military camp is not far\nfrom the riverbank. It only takes about\n10 minutes to walk there. The onlookers\nwalked in groups, making the journey\nextremely lively. Meanwhile, at the\nImperial College in the capital city,\nthe classes had just ended, and the\nstudents in the classroom were either\nstudying with their books or chatting\nquietly in twos and threes. In the last\nrow of the classroom, two students were\ntalking quietly, and it was unclear what\nthey were discussing. One of the\nstudents expressions changed and he\nslammed his hand on the table and stood\nup angrily. This is outrageous. The\nsudden shout immediately attracted the\nattention of the other students in the\nschool. Brother Yaoen, what's wrong? Why\nare you suddenly so angry? Who knows?\nMaking loud noise is against school\nrules. Isn't he afraid of being beaten\nby the baiffs? He probably suffered some\ninjustice and was just venting his\nanger. Let's pretend we didn't see it\nand no one is allowed to tell anyone.\nYes, brother Yao is a kind and helpful\nperson who has always helped his\nclassmates. We must not let him be\npunished. Just as everyone was\nwhispering among themselves, Yao Chian,\nthe protagonist, suddenly stepped to the\nfront of the school. Gentlemen, we\nstudents study at the Imperial Academy,\nreading the classics, learning the ways\nof the sages, and understanding the\nprinciples. We rarely go out. But little\ndid they know that here outside the\nschool, demons are rampant. Not only\nattacking the teachings of the sages,\nbut also belittling what we have learned\nas worthless. Moreover, it has been\npromoting a heretical path called\nscience. And even his majesty has been\ndeceived by its fallacies. They even\nclaim that Confucianism is not the way\nto govern a country and that only that\ndamn science is the real way to\nstrengthen a nation. After Yao Chin\nfinished speaking indignantly, all the\nstudents in the school were enraged.\nThey studied and researched it\ndiligently and regarded it as a classic\ndoctrine. But now it is being belittled\nby others. They even tried to bewitch\nthe emperor, saying that if this person\nsucceeded, wouldn't all their years of\nhard study have been in vain? Just as\neveryone was filled with anger, Yao Xian\nspoke up again. Gentlemen, although we\nare students, we also possess the pride\nof our ancestors. How can we allow such\nwicked words to mislead the public and\nharm the nation? For this matter, Sensor\nHang did not hesitate to smash his head\nagainst a pillar in front of the palace\nin court, attempting to awaken his\nmajesty by remmonstrating with his life.\nSuch righteousness and integrity deserve\nthe respect of us scholars. Since\nancient times, no one has ever escaped\ndeath. Let us leave behind a loyal heart\nto illuminate history. I have made my\ndecision today. I will leave the\nImperial College to eradicate evil, even\nif it means my death. Yao Chiian, I urge\nmy fellow students to join me in this\nrighteous cause. Chapter 170. The man\nwho died remmonstrating truly died in\nthe end. The students of Imperial\nCollege were selected from all over the\ncountry. Moreover, they were all\npassionate but blindly optimistic young\npeople. People of their age are\npsychologically immature and unstable\nand their values are not yet fully\nformed. They lack the ability to\nunderstand and judge things and their\nemotions are easily swayed. They lack\nthe ability to distinguish right from\nwrong and do not have enough judgment to\ndifferentiate between inflammatory words\nand persuasive statements. When emotions\nrun high, it's easy to be influenced and\nmanipulated by others. If no one takes\nthe lead, then nothing will happen. But\nonce someone steps forward, things will\nbe different. This person is the kind\nwho is eloquent, has friendly\nrelationships with others, and possesses\nstrong personal charisma. The outcome is\npretty much predictable, like what's\nhappening now. Yaoin's impassioned and\nhighly inflammatory speech immediately\ninfluenced the students. What about the\nintegrity of scholars, the pride of\nscholars, and the righteousness of\nscholars? Every word hits their sore\nspot. In addition, with so many people\nin the classroom, once the atmosphere is\nright, things just fall into place\nnaturally. As soon as Yao Chin finished\nspeaking, someone immediately responded,\n\"Brother Yao is right. If we scholars\nsit idly by and watch evil people bring\ndisaster to the country, then what's the\npoint of studying the classics? We might\nas well go back to our hometowns and\nfarm.\" That's right. If we are all\nafraid of death now, how can we become\nloyal ministers like Imperial Sensor\nHang in the future? Very well. Since\nBrother Yao has such ambition, how can\nwe back down? We will certainly lend you\na hand in this matter. Let's go\ntogether. Wait a minute. We alone are\nnot enough to attract attention. We\nshould call on other students. Only when\neveryone works together can we succeed.\nI don't know who said that last\nsentence, but it immediately resonated\nwith people. As the saying goes, the law\ndoes not punish the masses. And in their\nview, the more people involved, the less\nlikely they are to be punished\nafterward. So the students in the school\nbegan to call on their friends and\nrelatives. The Imperial College was\ndivided into six halls. The hall of\nself-discipline, the hall of sincerity,\nthe hall of the hall of cultivating the\nway, the hall of justice, and the hall\nof broad learning. Incited by the\nstudents, a considerable number of\nstudents in the six halls were provoked\nto anger. One by one, they vowed to\npunish Wei Woo, that wicked and\ntreacherous man. It has to be said that\nwith a large number of people, it is\nindeed much more convenient to move\naround. The Imperial College was\noriginally not allowed for students to\nenter and leave at will, but in the\ncurrent situation, no one dared to stop\nthem. After leaving the school, the\nstudents, led by Yao Chien, went to Hong\nLangs house. Huang Lang, who was\ninitially full of questions, turned pale\ninstantly after hearing why the students\nwere looking for him. Yes, he was\nscared. Although Hong Lang wasn't\nparticularly clever, he had served as an\nofficial for many years. He certainly\nneeds support, and the more people who\nsupport him, the better, but not in this\nway. What he needs is public opinion,\nthe voices and pins of writers across\nthe land so that he can be safer. But\nnow, the way these students are doing\nit, to put it mildly, is called forcing\nthe emperor to abdicate. To put it more\nseriously, it could even be considered a\nrebellion. When Li Shim first set up\nSchwan Wu Gate, he only had 800 people.\nNow almost half of them are at his own\ndoorstep. Looking at the large, wailing\ncrowd in front of him, Hang Lang felt\nlike crying. These people are\npractically putting him on the hot seat.\nHowever, just as he was about to say\nsomething, the students didn't give him\na chance at all. As the leader, Yao Chin\nsimply waved his hand. Gentlemen,\nImperial Sensor Hang is currently\nseriously injured. So, let's not disturb\nhim and let him rest and recuperate\nproperly. Moreover, Imperial Sensor Hang\nhas done all that he should do. It is up\nto us younger generations to take over\nthe work now. After speaking, Yao Chin\nturned to look at Hong Lang. Lord Huang,\nplease rest well. We're off. As soon as\nhe finished speaking, Yao Chin strode\naway with his men. Looking at the empty\ncourtyard, Hang Lang seemed to have all\nhis energy drained away, and he pllopped\ndown on the ground. It's over this time.\nI'm definitely dead. Definitely dead. He\nsat on the ground looking lost and\ndejected, muttering to himself\nrepeatedly. However, Huang Lang did not\nnotice that behind him, a masked man\nwith a fierce glint in his eyes was\nquietly approaching. At this critical\nmoment, Hang Lang, who was in despair,\nsuddenly raised his head. Yes, I can\nfind them. Only they can save me. They\ndefinitely can save me. Thinking of his\nonly hope of survival, Huang Lang\nimmediately wanted to get up and stand\nup. Before he could even move, a rope\nappeared out of nowhere at his throat.\nBefore he could even react, the rope\nsuddenly tightened and strangled his\nneck. With his life threatened, Hang\nLang struggled desperately to resist,\nbut to no avail. His struggles were\nfeudal, and a masked man even led him\ninto the room. Soon, blood spots\nappeared in Hong Langs eyes, and the\nskin on his face turned bluish purple\nand swollen. The tongue involuntarily\nprotrudes from the mouth, trying to get\neven a little bit of air. Unfortunately,\nthis was destined to be a waste of\neffort. As time passed, Hang Lang seemed\nto lose all his strength, and his\nstruggling movements became weaker and\nweaker until his consciousness became\nblurred. He finally kicked his legs and\nleft this world forever. Even so, the\nmasked man showed no sign of letting go\nuntil several minutes later when he\nfinally released the rope. However,\nthat's not all. After confirming that\nHang Lang had died, the masked man took\nout an even longer hemp rope and threw\nit onto the roof beam. They tied a tight\nknot around the roof beam with a hemp\nrope, then lifted Hong Lang up and put\nthe rope around his neck. After\nconfirming that there were no flaws, the\nmasked man took out a pre-written letter\nfrom his pocket. On the white envelope\nwere three large characters written\nneatly. Your subject, I will\nremmonstrate to the death. If anyone\nhere is familiar with Hang Lang, they\nwill immediately recognize that this is\nclearly Hang Langs handwriting. The\nmasked man placed the envelope in the\nmost conspicuous spot in the room, then\nlooked up a Hang Langs corpse with a\ncold gaze. Then, without saying a word,\nhe decisively turned and left. On the\nother side, after the students of the\nImperial Academy came out of Hang Langs\nhouse, Yaoin immediately assigned them\ntasks. It wasn't really a distribution\nbecause everyone had the same task to\nexpose Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s evil deeds to the\npublic. The students scattered\nthroughout the capital recounting Chow\nChows actions and unorthodox remarks,\nlist his crimes and the possible\nconsequences and publicize these matters\nto the people. Simply put, it smear\ncampaigns combined with information\nbombardment and brainwashing. This world\nis always full of hearsay. Some things\nbecome true simply because they are said\nso often. Most people were not well\neducated. And this was an era when all\nother professions were considered\ninferior except for studying.\nFurthermore, since those who spoke of\nthese matters were all students of the\nImperial Academy, their words were more\nlikely to be believed by the common\npeople. As a result, the public opinion\nthat was already unfavorable to Wayi Wu\nhas now reached the point where it is\nconsidered unforgivable if we woo is not\nkilled. They even affectionately gave\nhim a nickname way the thief. While the\nstudents were frantically inciting the\npeople, a member of the Imperial Guard\nwas galloping towards the riverbank.\nChapter 171 student movement erupts.\nImperial College students act\nrecklessly. The uninformed people had no\nidea what the truth was. Initially, the\nprevailing opinion was that Chow Chow\nbelittled the sages and criticized their\nwords as not the way to govern the\ncountry. However, as time went on, the\nrumors became increasingly outrageous.\nWhat about Chow Chow insulting the\nsages, spreading the idea that studying\nis useless, and using treacherous words\nto bewitch the emperor into abolishing\nschools. From then on, children did not\nlearn the four books and five classics,\nnor the way of the sages. In the future,\nthey would even have to use unorthodox\nand heretical methods as the way to\nselect officials. In an instant, Weii Wu\nbecame known in the hearts of the people\nas someone like Chin Hui and Xiao Gao.\nThe Ming dynasty had only been\nestablished for a little over a decade,\nand most of its people had experienced\nthe chaos of the late Yuan dynasty. The\nimage of a world where even survival was\ndifficult with corpses strewn everywhere\nstill lingers in their minds. Now that\nthe world is at peace, people no longer\nhave to live a life of wandering and\ndisplacement. they can live the peaceful\nand prosperous life they've always\ndreamed of. However, we wu misled the\nemperor, attempting to ruin the fate of\nthe Ming dynasty and even caused the\nMing dynasty to be on the verge of\ncollapse. If he continues like this, the\npeaceful days we've finally gotten are\nprobably coming to an end. Furthermore,\nChow Chow wanted to abolish schools,\npreventing their children from studying\nand thus denying them the opportunity to\npass the imperial examinations in the\nfuture. Whether it's living a peaceful\nlife or ensuring a child's future, these\nare all matters closely related to the\ninterests of ordinary people. As the\nsaying goes, rumors can be terrifying.\nRegardless of whether these rumors are\ntrue or not, the people are genuinely\nafraid. I'm afraid of going back to the\nchaotic times, afraid that my good days\nwill be over, and afraid that my\nchildren will have no future. So after a\nperiod of fermentation, the people who\nhad been swayed by the students all took\nto the streets to support them. However,\nthis is still a minor issue. After all,\nordinary people are just the lowest\nlevel of society. They have little\nability and few means. So there's only\nso much they can do. But it's different\nfor those scholars. The Imperial Academy\nwas not the only place of learning in\nthe capital. There were also many\nprivate schools andmies. The Imperial\nCollege was essentially a state-run\nuniversity and its students were among\nthe most outstanding students from all\nover the country. He was selected to\nstudy at the Imperial Academy because of\nan order from Zu Yuan Jang. Among\nscholars, their words are easily\nbelieved by students in private schools\nandmies. Thus, encouraged by the\nstudents of the Imperial Academy, these\nequally young scholars also got excited.\nAnd so what was originally just a small\ngroup of people has now evolved into a\nstudent movement and even public\nresentment has been stirred up. More and\nmore young students are leaving the\nschool and joining the ranks of students\nat the Imperial College. Originally they\nsimply wanted to unite more people and\nlet the matter continue to escalate with\nthe aim of attracting the emperor's\nattention. The goal is simply to\neliminate the harm and save the country.\nI don't want to cause any major trouble.\nHowever, things in this world become\nuncontrollable when there are too many\npeople involved. Just as the students\nmorale reached its peak, someone in the\ncrowd suddenly shouted something. Let's\ngo to Wei's residence, arrest him, and\ngive the people an explanation. In fact,\nthese students didn't know what to do at\nfirst. They were just offering support\nwithout any clear goals. As a result,\nthis one sentence immediately helped\nthem find their goal. Immediately\nafterwards, the students filled with\nanger turned around and headed towards\nWei Woo&lt;unk&gt;s residence. However, they\ndidn't notice that a maid carrying a\nbasket nearby had overheard their\nconversation. They even abandoned the\nbasket in their hands and ran\nfrantically in the same direction. Way\nmansion. Leah, who had just rushed back\nfrom the market, burst into the mansion\nand shouted at the gatekeeper. Quickly,\nquickly, close the door tightly right\nnow and don't open it for anyone who\nknocks. As she shouted, Leah didn't stop\nwalking and rushed to the family's\naccounting office. Madam, madam,\nsomething terrible has happened. Hearing\nLeah's shout, Zhuwan walked out of the\naccounting room with a puzzled look on\nher face. Leah, what has made you so\npanicked? Madam, something terrible has\nhappened. There are so many students\noutside. They they seem to be trying to\ncause trouble for the young master. I\noverheard them on the way. They said\nthey were coming to our mansion, that\nthey were going to arrest the young\nmaster and give the world an\nexplanation. Lead ran back breathlessly,\nbut she still managed to finish\nexplaining everything. Zuyuan, who had\nbeen looking puzzled, immediately became\nserious after hearing this. She frowned,\nbowed her head, and pondered how to deal\nwith the situation. In fact, Zhu Yushwan\nhad always known about the rumors\ncirculating outside and she had thought\nabout how to deal with them. However,\nWayiu told her that there was no need to\nworry too much about this matter and\nthat she should just let things develop\nas they would. Once the Science and\nTechnology Institute's results\npresentation is over, all the rumors\nwill disappear. Unexpectedly, things\nhave escalated to this point to the\npoint where she's even going so far as\nto come to her home and confront her\nhusband. Madam, madam, something\nterrible has happened. There are a lot\nof people outside our mansion gate. They\nsay they want the master to leave. Just\nas Xu Yuwan was thinking about how to\ndeal with it, the gatekeeper rushed in\nlooking flustered. Upon hearing this,\nZhuan wasn't nervous yet, but Leah\ngasped in surprise. Wow, they arrived so\nquickly. Just as the two were panicking,\nZhuan calmly made arrangements. Uncle\nChun, immediately tell the servants to\nput down what they are doing and guard\nthe doors of the house to prevent anyone\nfrom breaking in. Also, have someone\nclimb the ladder over the wall to check\nif those people are at the back door. If\nthere's no one there, find a way to get\nLeah out. After giving the doorman an\ninstruction, Zhu Yuwan turned to look at\nLeah. Leah, the Imperial guards who were\nsupposed to protect our family have all\nleft with my husband. Now we have to\nsolve this problem ourselves. Ching Sha\nis at the workshop. Naza and Dabba are\nstill young, so I can only ask you to\nmake the trip and bring my jade seal.\nLet's go to the Inion Prefecture\ngovernment office first. It's closer to\nour home, and then we'll go to the\nembroidered uniform guard to ask for\nhelp from the garrison. Upon hearing Zhu\nYuswan's instructions, the doorman and\nLeah immediately began to act.\nFortunately, the students did not storm\nthe main gate of the mansion, nor were\nthere any people sent to surround the\nback gate. Upon receiving news that Leah\nhad successfully exited through the back\ndoor, Zhu Yuwan breathed a sigh of\nrelief. As long as they don't force\ntheir way in, everything should be fine.\nJust as Xu Yuwan was sighing, a clanging\nsound suddenly came from the roof. When\nshe came out of the accounting office,\nshe realized that someone was throwing\nthings outside the courtyard wall.\nstones, dirt, rotten vegetable leaves,\nrotten eggs, and some people even throw\nexcrement and urine into their own\nhomes. This situation certainly wouldn't\narise from those self-important\nscholars, but rather from the misled\ncommon people. Zuwan didn't have any\ngood solutions and could only wait for\nLeah to return with her people.\nMeanwhile, the imperial guards who rode\nto the riverbank to deliver the message\nfinally met Maang. Then Maang approached\nZhu Yuan Jang and whispered, \"Your\nmajesty, as you predicted, something has\nindeed happened in the city. Students\nfrom the Imperial Academy have left the\nschool without permission and are\nspreading rumors and slandering the Earl\nof Chonglu in the city.\" Zhu Yuan Jangs\neyes narrowed, a chilling coldness\nemanating from them. The Imperial\nAcademy. Very well. We haven't killed\nenough of them yet. Chapter 172. Zhu\nYuan Jang. Let's see how big a fuss they\ncan cause. Hearing Zhu Yuan Jang&lt;unk&gt;s\ntone of voice, Maang couldn't help but\nshiver. He remember the last time he\nheard Zhu Yuan Jang speak in this tone\nwas during the Hui Yong case. It's no\nwonder that Lo was so angry. Olu had\nlong suspected that someone would cause\ntrouble when the Academy of Sciences\nshowcased its achievements. He just\ndidn't expect that the mastermind behind\nit would actually target a place like\nthe Imperial College. What is the\nImperial College? Those positions are\nfor cultivating talent and recruiting\nwise and capable individuals for the\ncountry. It's no exaggeration to say\nthey represent the future of a nation.\nHowever, such an important position was\ninterfered with and such a big thing\nhappened. Any person in power would be\nangry, such as Zu Bao sitting next to\nZu. His face was as black as charcoal at\nthis moment, but he didn't say anything\nbecause old Zu was there. Just as Mao\nXang felt the air about to freeze, Zhu\nYuan Jang finally spoke. What is the\nsituation in the city now? Upon hearing\nZhu Yuan Jang&lt;unk&gt;s question, Maang\nfinally breathed the sigh of relief. The\nrumors have already aroused public\nanger, and the Earl of Changel has been\ncursed by them as a traitor to the\ncountry, just like Chin Hui and Xiao\nGao. Your Majesty, before things\nescalate too much, shouldn't we stop it\nimmediately to prevent? Before Maang\ncould finish speaking, Zhu Yuan Jang\nwaved his hand to interrupt him. Let\nthem make a scene. Let's see what other\ntricks they have up their sleeves. After\nhe finished speaking, Zhu Yuan Jang\nasked another question. The Five Cities\ngarrison hasn't made a move, has it? No.\nAs your majesty ordered, I sent someone\nto inform them early this morning that\nthey must not act rashly without orders.\nThat's settled then. Continue the\ninvestigation and send back any news\nimmediately.\nYes. Maang responded respectfully, then\nimmediately turned and left. Zhu Yuan\nJang also looked into the distance where\nWei Wu was speaking through a megaphone.\nLadies and gentlemen, there are\ncountless ships coming and going on the\nYangze River. You must have seen them\nquite often, but what you see are all\nships going downstream. If they're going\nupstream, they can only rely on sails\nand human and animal power to pull the\nboats. I bet you've never seen a boat\nthat can sail upstream without wind,\nsails, oars, or tow ropes. The people\nwho had been eagerly anticipating the\nnew technology immediately became\nexcited upon hearing Weii Wu speak\nbecause whenever we woo spoke, they\ncould see something new and interesting.\nHowever, these people still couldn't\nhelp but have doubts about what we woo\nsaid. Without sails, ores, or tow ropes,\nhow can a boat go upstream? Yes. Is it\nreally possible for such a thing to\nhappen? Does the Earl of Changangle\nreally have a way to do it?\nThe river is flowing rapidly today.\nThere's no way you could go upstream.\nAfter what happened at the drill ground,\nmany people among the common people\nbecame fans of Wei Wu. Upon hearing\nsomeone question him, someone\nimmediately stood up to speak up for Wei\nWu. Didn't you all see what happened in\nthe training ground just now? How dare\nyou question the Earl of Chong Lee's\nabilities? That's right. That's right.\nI'm telling you, it's best not to\nquestion the Earl of Chonglu or you'll\nregret it. Actually, there were paddle\nwheel boats as early as the Song\nDynasty. They could move without sails\nor human ores. What's there to question?\nUpon hearing what these people said,\nthose who had previously questioned them\nimmediately shut their mouths. Actually,\nthey weren't being malicious in their\nquestioning. They had been shocked by\nWei Woo back in the training grounds.\nIt's just that due to his limited\nunderstanding, he couldn't believe what\nwe woo said. But deep down, I still\nwanted to see the kind of ship that we\nwoo had described. So just as everyone\nwas waiting, we woo raised his hand and\npointed in a certain direction on the\nriver. Look, this is the boat I was\ntalking about. The one that can go\nupstream without wind, sails, ores, or\ntow ropes. Upon hearing this, everyone\nimmediately looked in the direction way\nWoo was pointing. In the distance, a\npainted boat with thick smoke billowing\nfrom its roof appeared on the river. At\nthis moment, the ship is traveling\nupstream, slowly making its way towards\nthe upper reaches of the river. Quick,\nlook, a boat is on fire on the river. We\nneed to find a boat to rescue them. Just\nas everyone was looking at the river, a\ncry of surprise suddenly rang out from\nthe crowd. Upon hearing this\nexclamation, a commotion immediately\narose among the crowd and Weii Wu\nquickly spoke up. Don't panic everyone.\nThe ship isn't on fire. This smoke is\nnormal. Just wait and see. After we\nwoo&lt;unk&gt;s words, the crowd immediately\nquieted down and everyone looked at the\nship again. As time passed, the ship\ngradually approached the location of the\ncrowd. Only then did everyone realize\nthat it was a pleasure boat, a type of\nboat without sails. Moreover, there were\nindeed no or oars on the hull. Yet, the\nboat was traveling against the current\nat a remarkably fast speed. At the same\ntime, they finally determined that the\nship was not on fire because there\nwasn't even a glimmer of light on board.\nI just can't figure out where all this\nsmoke is coming from. Just as everyone\nwas wondering, they heard Wayi Woos\nvoice again. Are you wondering why the\nship is emitting smoke and where this\nsmoke is coming from? After saying this\nwithout waiting for the audience's\nresponse, we woo continued. The reason\nthe ship can move is because we\ninstalled a steam engine inside the\nship's cabin which makes it move by\nsteam. Weii Wu then gave a brief\nexplanation, but of course, he couldn't\nreveal the core secrets of the steam\nengine. Even so, the people were still\namazed. Little did they know that simply\nburning wood and charcoal would make the\nboat move on its own. If they hadn't\nseen it with their own eyes, and if the\nfacts weren't right in front of them,\nthey would never have believed it. This\nis the greatest achievement of our\ninstitute, and I would like to take this\nopportunity to tell everyone something.\nFrom the very beginning, the purpose of\nestablishing the Academy of Sciences was\nto make the Ming Dynasty better, richer,\nand stronger. At this point, we wu took\na deep breath. With cement, we can not\nonly build bigger and stronger houses,\nbut also build wider and smoother roads.\nMore powerful firearms will make our\nMing army invincible and better protect\nthe people of Ming from being\nslaughtered by the enemy. The advent of\nthe steam engine made the Ming dynasty\nunparalleled in the world and made it\neven richer. Perhaps you don't\nunderstand what I'm saying now, but one\nday in the future, you will personally\nexperience the benefits of these things.\nThat concludes today's presentation.\nPlease return to your respective areas.\nAfter hearing Wu&lt;unk&gt;s words, the people\nspontaneously applauded him. Although\nthey didn't really understand what was\nso good about the steam engine, they\ncould still understand cement and\nfirearms. For them, who had experienced\nthe rule of the Yuan dynasty, firearms\nwere the most important thing. Just as\nWei Wu said, with these firearms, they\nno longer had to worry about being\nenslaved by foreign tribes. Although\nthey were still somewhat reluctant to\nleave, the people obediently departed\nafter hearing Wayi Wu&lt;unk&gt;s words.\nSeeing the people leave, Weii Wu turned\nand walked towards Zhu Yuan Jang. As\nsoon as they approached, they heard\nMaang reporting to Zhu Yuan Jang. Your\nMajesty, news has just arrived that the\nstudents of the Imperial Academy have\nincited the people to surround the\nmansion of the Marquee of Changangle.\nChapter 173. Remember this in your next\nlife. There are some things you should\nstill believe in. Weii Wu was in a\npretty good mood after the Academy of\nScienc's achievement exhibition\nconcluded successfully. Upon hearing\nwhat Maang said, his face immediately\ndarkened. Without saying a word, he\nturned around, waved his hand, and took\nout an off-road motorcycle from the\nsystem warehouse and mounted it. Without\nthe slightest hesitation, the clutch was\nengaged, gear shifted, and the\naccelerator was floored, propelling the\ncar forward. because the fuel couldn't\nbe replenished. Wayu hadn't been willing\nto use this thing since he got it. But\nnow that something has happened at home,\nhe can't care about anything else. He\njust wants to get home as quickly as\npossible to protect his wife. As the\nengine roared to life, Zhu Yuan Jang and\nMao Xiang realized that Wei Wu had\nalready arrived. But by the time they\nturned around, Wei Wu had already ridden\naway on his motorcycle. Maang, you\nimmediately take your men and follow\nthem to help. We've granted you special\npermission to ride freely in the\ncapital. Anyone who tries to stop you\nwill be killed without mercy. Remember,\nyou can die, but Shia Wu absolutely\ncannot be harmed. Otherwise, you won't\nbe coming back. Go now. Upon hearing\nthis, Maoang felt utterly miserable.\nThis matter shouldn't have come to this\npoint. It's clearly your majesty's\nindulgence that has led to this\nsituation. If you hadn't ordered the\nFive Cities garrison not to act rashly,\nthose students wouldn't have had the\nability to cause such a commotion. I\nknow you would find all the\ntroublemakers involved and eliminate the\nthreat. But you caused all this trouble,\nand now I'm the one who has to take the\nblame. What did I ever do to deserve\nthis? At this moment, Maang felt\nextremely wronged, but he could only\nkeep these thoughts to himself.\nActually, you can't really blame him for\nthis. When the first imperial guard left\nthe city, the students hadn't even\nconsidered going to Wei Woo&lt;unk&gt;s\nresidence. Only after the students had\nbrought the matter to light did the\nimperial guards send people over again,\nand that's when he received the news. If\nMaoang had received the news earlier, he\ncould have made arrangements in advance\nand wouldn't be in such a passive\nposition now. However, there are no\nwhatifs in this world, so he has to take\nthe blame. Despite feeling wronged,\nMaang did not stop moving at all. Upon\nreceiving Zhu Yuan Jang&lt;unk&gt;s order, he\nimmediately led a large number of men on\nhorseback to pursue Wu. After Mao Xiang\nleft, Zhu Yuan Jang still felt uneasy\nand issued another order. Someone,\nprepare our horses. Not long after, Zhu\nYuan Jang, who was over 50 years old,\ndressed in a dragon robe and let a large\nnumber of guards on horseback home. At\nthe same time, Weii Wu was rushing back.\nThe students at the manor were also\nrunning out of patience and some in the\ncrowd had already begun to offer\nsuggestions. They simply broke down the\ngate and dragged Wei Woo out of the\nhouse. However, this suggestion did not\nreceive the support of most people. It\nwould have been fine if they had\nsurrounded the way residence and forced\nWei Woo out, but breaking into the\nresidence was a completely different\nmatter. You must understand that we woo\nis the princess's husband. If things get\nchaotic and the princess suffers any\ninjury, then there will be a lot of\ntrouble. However, at this point, the\ndevelopment of the situation is no\nlonger in the control of these students.\nAfter the proposal to storm the way\nresidence was rejected, the person who\nspoke up turned his attention to the\ncommon people. The man first withdrew\nfrom the line of students and then\nquietly blended into the crowd of\npeople. He didn't shout loudly, but hid\namong the crowd and whispered incitement\nto the people. When he felt it was about\ntime, he suddenly shouted something. We\nhiding in the mansion, either plotting\nsomething bad or trying to escape. We\ncan't let him get away. As soon as he\nfinished speaking, someone in the crowd\nimmediately responded, \"That's right. We\nabsolutely can't let him escape. Let's\nrush in and capture that traitor away.\"\nAfter saying that, the person who\nresponded immediately rushed to the\nfront door and pushed it open. Charge\nthe way residents. Capture the traitor\nway. Charge the way residents. Capture\nthe traitor way. With someone taking the\nlead, the other people immediately\nshouted and rushed forward, frantically\npushing open the door. The servants in\nWayi Woos residents were also frightened\nwhen they noticed what was happening\noutside. Fearing that these people would\nbreak down the gate, they immediately\nfound a large wooden pillar and placed\nit behind the gate. Now they just hoped\nthat Leah can bring people over soon or\nthat their master will come back\nquickly. As time passed, more and more\npeople pushed open the outer gate, and\nthe mansion gate began to shake. It\nprobably won't be long before they push\nit away by outsiders. Bang! Just as the\ntwo sides were locked in a stalemate, a\ncrisp gunshot rang out, followed by\nseveral agonizing cries of pain. Among\nthe people who pushed open the door,\nseveral people standing on the outermost\nedge collapsed on the spot, bleeding\nprofusely. Before these people could\nfigure out what was going on, they heard\na cold voice filled with murderous\nintent. Push. Keep pushing. Let's see\nhow many of your lives I have to kill.\nUpon hearing this voice, the people\nlooked in the direction of a sound and\nsaw Wayi Woo holding a strangely shaped\niron rod. He walked in from outside the\ncrowd with a frosty expression. Upon\nseeing Wayi Wu appear, some of the\nstudents who came out of the Imperial\nAcademy immediately spoke up. You\ntraitor away Bang. Before the man could\nfinish speaking, Wei Wu pulled the\ntrigger. Because the distance was\nsufficient, this shot sent the person\nwho was speaking flying backward. It\nwasn't until he fell to the ground that\nthose around him noticed that his body\nwas riddled with holes. Bright red blood\nwas seeping from these holes, which\nlooked extremely horrifying. Such a\nbrutal scene terrified everyone present,\nwhether students or ordinary citizens,\nthat they dared not utter a sound. They\nwere terrified that if they made any\nsound, they would be the next to die. It\nmust be said that these people made the\nright choice in the face of life and\ndeath. Wayi Wu is currently in a fit of\nrage and he doesn't care whether the\npeople in front of him are commoners or\nstudents. Regardless of their identity,\nanyone who tries to break into your home\nand threaten the safety of your family\nis a mob. At this point, even the\nslightest noise would prompt him to\nshoot and kill someone. Carrying a gun,\nhe slowly walked through the crowd\ntoward his own front door. Those who had\noriginally gathered here were forced to\nretreat step by step by way. Woo!\ngradually moving away from the gate.\nStanding in front of his own gate, we wu\ncoldly looked at the people in front of\nhim. Under his gaze, no one dared to act\nrecklessly. Seeing this, we wu slowly\nspoke. Students of the Imperial Academy,\nright? Who's the leader? Step forward\nand talk to me. Upon hearing Wu&lt;unk&gt;s\nwords, the students exchanged glances,\nbut none of them stepped forward to\nspeak. At this moment, we wu spoke\nagain. What? You have the guts to cause\ntrouble on my doorstep and even try to\nbreak down the door, but you don't have\nthe guts to stand up and admit it. As\nsoon as we Wu finished speaking, a\nfigure stepped out from the crowd. It\nwas the student named Yaoen. He tilted\nhis head back, looking directly at Wei\nWu with unwavering confidence and said,\n\"I am the leader. You traitor away. If\nyou have the guts, kill me and then kill\nall of us. Otherwise, let's see how you\nsilence the public, you traitorous\nbastard. Upon hearing this, we\nimmediately burst in a laughter. Haha.\nTry to silence the public. Why should I?\nYou think you're a hero? No. You're a\nthug who broke into someone's house. As\nhe spoke, Wayi Wu raised his shotgun and\naimed at Yaoin. Seeing this, Yao Chin's\neyes trembled slightly, but he still\nforced himself to speak. I don't believe\nyou dare to kill me. Bang. You don't\nbelieve I dare kill you? Then remember\nthis in your next life. There are some\nthings you should believe in. Chapter\n174. After killing Yao Chin, Lu Sanu\nsuddenly appeared. As sparks flew from a\nmuzzle, countless steel balls shot out,\nriddling Yao Chin with bullets on the\nspot. Seeing Yao Chin lying on the\nground, his body mangled and bloody. The\nsurrounding students were all terrified.\nWhen Wei Wu fired the gun and killed\npeople, they thought it was just a way\nto control the situation and intimidate\nthem. Now that the situation has\nstabilized, Weii Wu still kills people\nat the slightest provocation. These\nstudents are young people with little\nexperience. They've never encountered\nanything like this before. To witness\nYao Chin's death firsthand and in such a\ntragic manner. Add to that the people\nwho just died and the stench of blood\nthat filled the air. Many people's\npsychological defenses collapsed and\nthey vomited on the spot, turning pale\nand unable to straighten their backs.\nLooking coldly at these useless\nscholars, Weii Woo was filled with\ncontempt. What the hell? Even when I\nkilled someone for the first time, I\nwasn't this disgusted and vomiting.\nAfter making a disdainful remark, we woo\nspoke again. Now, answer my question.\nWho gave you the audacity to cause\ntrouble on my doorstep and even attempt\nto break into my residence? Although\nWeii Wu&lt;unk&gt;s voice wasn't loud, it\nstill stood out because the room was\ncompletely silent. The servants guarding\nthe gate breathed a sigh of relief upon\nhearing Weii Wu&lt;unk&gt;s voice. Immediately\nafterwards, the door slowly opened and\nservants with flustered expressions\nemerged from behind it. They carried all\nsorts of weapons, including brooms,\nshovels, and even rolling pins. As soon\nas they came out, they surrounded Wayi\nWoo, seemingly to protect him. But in\nreality, they had found a pillar of\nsupport. Naza, the little girl, even had\ntears in her eyes, tightly gripping Weii\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s sleeve. Seeing this, Wei Wu\npatted her head and then asked the\nquestion, \"Is Madam all right?\" Upon\nhearing this, Naza quickly shook her\nhead and said, \"Madam is all right.\nShe's in the accounting office.\" Upon\nlearning that Zuyuan was all right, we\nwu nodded slowly, then looked at the\ncrowd with a fierce glint in his eyes\nonce more. \"Are you all mute? Didn't you\nhear me asking you a question?\" The\natmosphere was already tense, and Wei\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s extremely unfriendly tone only\nexacerbated the situation. Many people\nwere startled by him, but Yao Chin's\nfate was looming. And at this moment, no\none dared to step forward and speak to\nWei Wu. Many people even began to wonder\nwhether they should turn around and run\naway. Upon seeing the strange weapon in\nWei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s hand. Those who wanted to\nescape immediately abandoned the idea.\nJust as the situation reached a\nstalemate, an old voice came from\noutside the crowd. Lord Chanla, you have\ngone too far. Even if you're the prince\nconsort, you have no right to kill\nsomeone in the street. At first, Wayiu\nwas also very curious who was so\npretentious. The person hadn't even\nappeared yet, but their voice had come\nfirst. However, after hearing what the\nother person said, he immediately\nfrowned. If this person only brought up\nhis title of Earl of Changangle, then\nWayi Wu would not have any reaction. The\nkey issue is that the person speaking\nactually brought up his status as a\nprince consort, which is a very\nproblematic way of speaking. For someone\nof high status to commit murder in the\nstreets of the capital is an extremely\nsensitive matter. By deliberately\nemphasizing his status as the emperor's\nson-in-law, the information is more\nlikely to evoke associations. Wayi Wu\nwas still wondering who the speaker was\nwhen an elderly man with a white beard\nnearly 70 years old stepped out from the\ncrowd. At the same time, the students\nwho were initially too scared to speak\nsuddenly seemed to have found their\ntribe. They looked at the old man with\nburning eyes and bowed to him. Mr.\nSanwell, what brings you here? Student\ngreets Mr. Lou. As a novice scholar, I\nam fortunate to have met Elder Tantan.\nHow fortunate I am. Upon hearing how the\nstudents addressed the old man, Wayi Wu\nimmediately guessed who he was. No\nwonder these students reacted to him\nlike fans of their favorite celebrities.\nAlthough the titles are different, they\nall refer to the same person, Lu San Wu,\na great confusion scholar of our time.\nLu San Wu, originally named Lu Kuan,\nlater changed his name to Lu Rousen,\ncourtesy named San Wu, also known as\nTanfu or Tanwin. Upon learning that it\nwas him, we wu&lt;unk&gt;s eyes immediately\nnarrowed. It's not surprising that the\nstudents admire Lu Sanu so much. What's\nsurprising is that this old fellow is in\nthe capital. Others may not know, but we\nknew very well that Lu Sanu was only\nrecommended to the court by Ru Chong in\nthe 18th year of Hong Wu. There's still\nmore than 3 years to go. At this time,\nhe should be living in seclusion in his\nhometown, devoting himself to writing.\nIf someone who shouldn't be there\nappears at the wrong time, we would\nnever believe there wasn't something\nfishy going on. Although Lu Sam Wu was a\ngreat confusion scholar of his time,\nChow Chow believed that he was unworthy\nof the title he had given himself. He's\nnothing more than a powerful pawn in the\nhands of a gentry. Lu Sanu's most famous\ndeed was the North South examination\ncase in the 30th year of the Hong Wu\nreign. The proportions and population\ndistribution of the five imperial\nexaminations prior to the north south\nexamination scandal were all relatively\nreasonable. However, in the sixth\nimperial examination, all 51 newly\nappointed scholars were from the south\nand not a single one was from the north.\nThe chief examiner for this imperial\nexamination was Lou Sanill. Because the\nincident escalated so much, all the\nother people involved were killed. but\nhe was spared the death penalty due to\nhis old age and was instead exiled to\nthe border. However, Zhu Yuan Jang had\njust passed away when Zhu Yunwin\nimmediately issued an edict, eagerly\nsummoning Lu Sanak. Based on the\ninformation currently available, Wayi Wu\nhad previously speculated that the Lu\nfamily was supported by the Kong family.\nThey attempted to pave the way for Zhu\nYun Wan to ascend the throne by using\nthe key figure of Crown Princess Lu.\nThis way, the next emperor of the Ming\ndynasty will no longer target the Kong\nfamily. Based on this conclusion, this\nis why Chow Chow suspected that Lu San\nWu was a pawn of the Gentry group. Now\nthat this piece has appeared ahead of\nschedule and even at his doorstep, it\nwould be strange if there wasn't\nsomething fishy going on. Thinking of\nthis, Wayi Wu looked up and met Lu San's\ngaze, saying, \"Who do we have here? It's\nnone other than Lu San Wu, the great\nConfucian scholar of our time. After\nsaying that, we wu casually pointed to a\nservant standing beside him and\ncontinued, \"Let me introduce you. This\nis my servant, Hong Xi. He is a very\ndiligent and hard-working young man.\nEven in my own household, I once won\nfirst place in a cleaning and tidying\ncompetition, which made all the other\nservants extremely envious.\" Upon\nhearing Weii Wu praise him, the servant\nwho had been named by him immediately\nraised his head. The servant who had\nbeen a little nervous suddenly burst\ninto laughter. However, after hearing\nwhat we Wu said next. He was immediately\nstunned. Has your family ever hosted\nthis competition? I had no idea and no\none notified me. Just as the servant\nnamed Huang, she was wondering. He heard\nLu San Wu snort coldly. Lord Chonglu,\nstop beating around the bush. What does\nit matter to us what rank your servant\nranks in cleaning? As soon as Lu Sanu\nfinished speaking, Weii Wu immediately\nretorted, \"What does what happened to my\ndoorstep have to do with you? Are you\nsome idol scholar with nothing better to\ndo? Why do you want to meddle in\neverything?\" Chapter 175. Who dares to\nspread rumors about the marquee of\nChonglu? My imperial hospital will not\nstand for it. Lu San's expression\nimmediately changed after Weii Wu&lt;unk&gt;s\nsarcastic remark. He pointed at way Woo\nwith an indignant expression, glaring\nand shouting. Any injustice in the world\nis an issue that everyone can intervene\nin. You marquee of Changangle committed\nmurder in broad daylight in the street.\nWhy can't I intervene? Way looked at him\nnonchalantly and only replied casually\nafter Lu Sanu finished speaking. The\ngovernment will take care of any\ninjustices in the world. Why can't you?\nHave you ruined your brain from studying\ntoo much? What gives you the right to\ninterfere? Who are you? Are you a yammen\nrunner? Show me your official badge.\nWhat? You, Lu San Woo, a dignified\nconfusion scholar, are giving up your\nprofession and planning to become a\nwandering night errant specializing in\nwriting wrongs. The more way Wu spoke,\nthe uglier Louu San's face became, and\nhe tried to speak several times.\nHowever, under Wayi Wu&lt;unk&gt;s powerful\nattacks, he was unable to find a chance\nto speak. After finally waiting for Wei\nWu to stop, I thought he had finished\nspeaking. But before I could even open\nmy mouth, I heard we woo&lt;unk&gt;s voice\nagain. I really didn't expect that a\ndignified Confucian scholar would be\nlike a cruel official, lying through his\nteeth and distorting the truth. Lu Sanu,\nyou'd better get this straight. This\nisn't what I call killing someone in the\nstreet. Be careful what you say or I'll\naccuse you of slander. I remember that\nthe laws of the Ming dynasty stipulated\nthat those who spread rumors and slander\nwould be held accountable. In the most\nserious cases, they could even be\nsentenced to death by a thousand cuts.\nIt would have been better if we Woo\nhadn't brought it up. Once he did, Lu\nSam Wu felt as if he had found a\nbreakthrough. He raised his hand,\npointed at the several already cold\ncorpses, and said angrily, \"If it were\njust me who saw it, I could say it was\nbecause I'm old and my eyes are failing.\nBut now that so many people around have\nseen it with their own eyes, how could\nit be false? I was merely standing up\nfor justice with witnesses and evidence\nto prove it. How can you accuse me of\ndistorting the truth? Wayi Wu stared at\nLu San Wu expressionlessly and only\nspoke after Lou finished speaking. You\nsaw it with your own eyes? Then you must\nbe getting old and blind. I don't know\nwhat you saw, but all I saw was a group\nof vicious thugs. They were carrying\nsticks and stones and tried to break\ninto my home, threatening my family and\nproperty. Oh, by the way, my wife,\nPrincess Wayong, is in the manor. I\nsuspect that some of these people are\nremnants of the former Yuan dynasty\nattempting to assassinate the princess.\nAs Wayi Wu spoke, his eyes remained\nfixed on Lu San Wu, his gaze filled with\nweariness and suspicion. That look in\nhis eyes was as if he were questioning\nLu San Wu. Old man, I now suspect you\nare the assassin. You'd better tell me\nthe truth. Wayi Wu&lt;unk&gt;s purpose in\ndoing this was very simple. You're using\nmy status as the prince consort to cause\ntrouble, aren't you? Well, then I'll use\nthat status to cause trouble for you. It\nis already a serious crime for a\ncommoner to forcibly enter a nobleman's\nmansion, let alone when there is a\nprincess inside. Meanwhile, Lu Sam will\nlisten to Wayi Wu&lt;unk&gt;s words and saw\nthe look in Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s eyes. The\nsepttoguinarian's beard was practically\nstanding on end in anger. As a great\nConfucian scholar, he was always treated\nas an honored guest wherever he went,\nand he had never suffered such\nhumiliation before. In a fit of anger,\nhe pointed directly at Wei Woos nose and\nrebuked him. Sophistry. Such sophistry\nis utterly absurd. These are just\nordinary people, yet you falsely accuse\nthem of being traitors. The people were\njust a little agitated. What does that\nhave to do with assassinating the\nprincess? Besides, they only knocked on\nthe door and didn't enter the mansion.\nAnd yet, you cruy murdered them. Don't\nyou have even a shred of conscience? How\ncould you be so cold-blooded? Lu Sanu\nwanted to continue his long speech, but\nwe wu interrupted him directly. Lu San\nWu, if that's how you put it, then I\nhave to bring up my servant Hangi again,\njust as you said. What if Hong she ran\ninto your house and took off your wife's\nclothes and you happened to come back\nand caught him in the act? He was just a\nlittle emotional and he didn't go in.\nShouldn't you stay and watch him until\nhe goes in before saying anything? Upon\nhearing these words, the entire room\nfell silent. Lu San Wu was so angry that\nhe was on the verge of losing his\ncomposure and almost attacked Wayi Wu\nwithout regard for the decorum of a\nscholar. If it weren't for his advanced\nage and ways prime, he might have\nactually gone for it. His mouth is full\nof foul language. It is truly an insult\nto culture. Before I came to the\ncapital, I had already heard that the\nmarquee of Changangle was a heretic. I\nhad intended to enlighten you with the\nwords of sages and persuade you to turn\nback in time to avoid getting mired in\ntrouble. But now it seems that you are\nbeyond redemption. Disregarding the law,\ncommitting violence in the street, and\ntreating ordinary people like ants\nbecause of their power, such a scourge\nof the country deserves divine\nretribution even if no one intervenes.\nHumph. Upon hearing Lu Samu&lt;unk&gt;s words,\nwe woo&lt;unk&gt;s face darkened, and he\nimmediately cursed. The words of a sage\nwill enlighten me. Who the hell are you?\nYou're nothing but a dog's face. Do I\nneed you to enlighten me? You brat. Your\nwords are full of fallacies. I won't\nbother arguing with you. Lu San Wu\nreplied coldly, then waved his hand and\nturned to leave. Seeing this, we\nwu&lt;unk&gt;s eyes flashed with a sharp\nlight, and he immediately spoke up to\nstop him. Stop. Did I say you could\nleave? Upon hearing Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s shout\nto stop him, Lu Sanu immediately turned\naround and looked up at Wei Wu. But Wu\ndidn't speak. He just squinted and\nstared at him. Although A Wu had just\nstarted cursing, he was not blinded by\nanger. On the contrary, he was certain\nof one thing. Lu San Wu came with a\npurpose from the very beginning, and he\neven wanted to kick Lao Zhu while he was\ndown. Since he appeared, aside from\narguing with himself, his words have\nalways been laced with his own agenda.\nWhen he first claimed to have killed\nsomeone in the street, he deliberately\nbrought up his status as a prince\nconsort. This was intended to amplify\nthe existing class contradictions\nbetween the two sides and to completely\ncreate an irreconcilable antagonistic\nsituation. Furthermore, now he claims to\nbe abusing his power to bully the people\nand even deliberately says that if\npeople don't take care of themselves,\nheaven will punish them. This is clearly\ntelling the surrounding people that they\nwill not be punished even if they commit\ncrimes because the emperor is protecting\nthem. It must be said that these\nscholars may not be good at anything\nelse, but they're truly adept at using\ntheir tongues to spread rumors and sow\ndiscord. Once his words get out and are\npassed around by word of mouth, who\nknows how they will turn out. Now he has\nconveyed all the messages he wanted to\nconvey. If he were to leave now, his\nreputation would be completely ruined.\nEven Zu Yuan Jang would gain a\nreputation for protecting his\nson-in-law, which would inevitably\naffect his credibility among the people.\nSeeing wayu stop him, Lu Sam was\nsecretly sneered. He didn't believe Wei\nWu would dare to do anything to him.\nAfter all, he wasn't one of those\nunknown scholars. Seeing that we wu\nremained silent for a while, Lu Sam Wu\ncontinued, \"If you have the guts, kill\nme, too. Otherwise, I will expose you\nthis treacherous and harmful insect in\nfront of the whole world. Confident that\nway wouldn't dare kill him.\" Lusan Wu\nbecame increasingly unrestrained in his\nspeech. However, at that moment, a shout\nof anger came from the crowd. Nonsense.\nMarquy Chonglu is kind-hearted and cares\ndeeply for the people. Anyone who dares\nto spread rumors that he is a scourge to\nthe country and its people will be the\nfirst to object to it by the imperial\nhospital. Chapter 176. Imperial\nphysician Sue Shu debating with a great\nconfusion scholar Lu Sanu. Upon hearing\nthis angry outburst, both students and\nordinary citizens turned to look in the\ndirection of the sound. Then they saw\nthe Imperial physician Sue Shu, his face\nfull of anger and the imperial\nphysicians from the Imperial Hospital\naround him under the watchful eyes of\neveryone. Sushu led all the Imperial\nphysicians and hurried through the\ncrowd. Immediately afterwards, about 10\npeople stood straight in front of Lu San\nWu with physician Sue glaring at him\nwith an unfriendly look. So, you're the\none who said that the marquee of\nChangangle brought disaster to the\ncountry and the people, right? You\nuseless scholars can't do anything but\nspread rumors. You can make the dead\nsound alive with just a few words.\nYou're the ones who decide whether\nsomeone is guilty or innocent. If you're\nso capable, then produce the evidence.\nCome here. Explain me what it means to\nsay that the marquee of Changangle\nbrought disaster to the country and the\npeople. How did the marquee of\nChangangle bring disaster to the country\nand the people? Upon hearing physician\nSue's words, not only Lu San Wu, but\neven we woo was stunned for a long time.\nHe hadn't expected physician Sue to\nappear at this time and even more so to\nso sharply criticize Loose San Wu on his\nbehalf. In particular, the tone of\nphysician Sue's voice didn't sound like\nhe was helping him. Rather, it sounded\nmore like he was venting his anger. Just\nas Weii Wu was stunned, the surrounding\npeople also came to their senses.\nIt's Imperial physician Sue. But why is\nhe speaking up for Wei Woo, that\nvillain? That's right. Why would\nphysician Sue help Wei Woo? He's a true\nphilanthropist. Everyone, I feel there's\nsomething wrong. Dr. Sue is such a good\nperson. He wouldn't help bad people for\nno reason. That's right. We may have\nwronged an innocent person. Let's hear\nwhat physician Sue has to say. If Lu San\nWu is the idol these students worship,\nthen physician Sue is the living bodhis\nsutva in the hearts of the people. In\nthe past, whenever there was nothing to\ndo in the palace, physician Sue would\npersonally hold consultations at the\nHyman Pharmacy while he was in the\nImperial Hospital. He spends most of his\ndaily life helping the poor and needy\nwith their medical treatment and\ninjuries. The head of the Imperial\nMedical Academy, a person who was in\ncharge of treating the emperor, actually\ncared so much about ordinary people like\nthem. Not only was he kind and gentle,\nbut he was also a highly skilled doctor,\nearning him a high level of trust among\nthe common people in the capital. These\npoor, ordinary people don't care whether\nyou're a great scholar or not. They only\nknow who is good to them and has done\nthem a favor. Now that physician Su has\nstepped forward to help Wei Wu, the\npeople who have often benefited from his\nkindness immediately sided with him. At\nthis moment, Lu Sanwa finally came to\nhis senses and glanced arrogantly at\nSushu, the Imperial physician. However,\nhe didn't answer. He just watched\nquietly. Seeing this, physician Sue\nspoke again. What? Have you lost your\ntongue? Can't produce any evidence? Then\nexplain yourself why you've slandered\nMarquee Chong Lu as a scourge to the\ncountry and its people. Despite the\npersistent questioning from Physician\nSue, Lu Sanu maintained his irritating\ndemeanor and even refused to look at\nphysician Sue. He gave off an attitude\nthat said, \"You're not qualified for me\nto explain, and I don't even bother with\nyou.\" He then bypassed physician Sue and\nfixed his provocative gaze on Wei Woo.\nHis provocative behavior also ignited\nWeii Woos short temper. The hand holding\nthe shotgun slowly rose from his side.\nAlthough killing Lu Sam Wu would cause\nsome trouble, at worst it would just\nresult in being condemned by scholars\nacross the land, which is no big deal.\nAs someone from a later era, Chow Chow\nknew very well that as long as your\nachievements were outstanding and\nbrilliant enough, you would succeed.\nThere's no need to worry about postumous\nreputation, nor to care about these\nminor blemishes. Baichi has been\ncriticized for so many years. But in the\ninternet age, he is still respectfully\ncalled the god of slaughter by netzens.\nLu Sanu was nothing. Killing him was no\nbig deal. On the other side, Lu Sanu\nbegan to panic when he saw Weii Wu raise\nhis hand. He had just witnessed the\nweapon's power firsthand in the crowd.\nIf we Wu had actually fired, he\ncertainly wouldn't have survived. But\nwith so many people around, Lu San Wu\ncouldn't bring himself to beg for mercy\nor say anything consiliatory. At this\ncrucial moment, a loud voice rang out\nagain from outside the crowd. That's\nright. Explain it to us. We also want to\nknow how Marque Changel has brought\ndisaster to the country and its people\nso we can be more wary of him in the\nfuture. Indeed, I also want to hear your\nexplanation of how the marquee of\nChangangle has brought disaster to the\ncountry and its people. produce the\nevidence and I will immediately order\nhis execution even if he is my\nbrother-in-law.\nHearing these two sentences, even a fool\ncould guess that the emperor and the\ncrown prince had arrived. Then everyone\nlooked in the direction of the sound and\nsaw Zhu Yuan Jang and Zhu Bao\napproaching under the protection of\nguards. Meanwhile, outside the guards,\nthere are also some onlookers. If you\nlook closely, you'll see that many of\nthem had previously seen the Science and\nTechnology Institute's achievements on\ndisplay at the training ground and along\nthe riverbank. Upon seeing the Emperor's\narrival, everyone present immediately\nreacted and hurriedly bowed to Zhu Yuan\nJang. Zhu Yuan Jang simply waved his\nhand in response, not paying any\nattention to the matter of etiquette. He\nsimply kept his eyes fixed on Lu San Wu\nwithout revealing any emotion. Even\nafter Lu Sam Wu carefully observed him,\nhe still couldn't discern from Zhu Yuan\nJang&lt;unk&gt;s face what he was thinking or\nhis attitude towards the matter. He\ncould ignore physician Su's words and\nnot even give a response. But now that\nthe emperor has asked, if he doesn't\nspeak up, it would be a crime of\ndeceiving the emperor, resulting in the\nconfiscation of his family's property\nand the extermination of his clan. This\nhumble subject, Lu San Wu, pays respects\nto your majesty and his highness, the\ncrown prince. Lu Sanu bowed to Zhu Yuan\nJang and Zhu Bao as required, but\nreceived no response. Just like he had\ntreated physician Su earlier, the father\nand son simply watched him quietly.\nSeeing this, Lu San Wu inwardly cried\nout in alarm, but could only sigh and\nsay, \"Your majesty, the deeds of the\nmarquee of Changangle are known to all.\nHe values fallacies and heresies over\nthe teachings of the sages. So I will\nnot repeat them here. Take today for\nexample. He used his status as a\nnobleman and son-in-law to kill people\nin the street. Treating the lives of the\npeople of our great Ming as nothing more\nthan ants. These people included\ninnocent civilians and outstanding\ntalent from the Imperial Academy. Yet\nthey were all brutally murdered by him,\ntheir bodies barely cold. When Lu San\nspeaks, he is incredibly expressive and\nengaging. Unfortunately, before he could\nfinish speaking, physician Su stepped\nforward and interrupted him. Your\nmajesty, I have something to ask you.\nAllow. As soon as physician Su finished\nresponded. Upon hearing this, Physician\nSu turned and looked around in the\ncrowd, then pointed at a young man. Wong\nErgu, come out and tell his majesty what\nyou were doing before the marquee of\nChangangle returned and what your\npurpose was. As soon as physician Su\nfinished speaking, a thin young man\ncautiously stepped forward from the\ncrowd. Your majesty, your majesty, Weew\nwe urged for a long time but couldn't\nutter a single complete sentence. Seeing\nthis, Zhu Yuan Jang waved his hand. Say\nwhat you have to say and we'll pardon\nyou. Hearing this, Wong Ergu finally\nbreathed the sigh of relief and\nimmediately said, \"Your majesty,\" before\nthe Earl of Changangle returned, \"we\nwere smashing down the gate of his\nresidence. Our aim being to forcibly\nbreak into the mansion.\" Chapter 177\nDoctor becomes lawyer, turning plaintiff\ninto defendant. After Wong Ergu finished\nspeaking, neither Zhu Yuan Jang nor Zu\nBao had spoken yet. The onlookers\nstarted discussing it, especially those\nwho had previously attended the science\nand technology exhibition. No way. These\npeople are actually planning to break\ninto the marquee of Chong Lee's mansion.\nIsn't that something only thugs would\ndo? Are these people's brains filled\nwith maggots? The Earl of Changel worked\nhard to develop firearms, cement, and\nother things for the Ming dynasty, and\nthese people still want to harm him.\nExactly. And so many people together.\nAnd there are women in their household,\ntoo. What if someone had malicious\nintentions? Don't forget, the marquee of\nChonglu is the prince consort, and the\nprincess is at home. If something were\nto happen to him, the consequences would\nbe unimaginable. Unlike the city's\nresidents, these people who were\nspeaking had all seen the science and\ntechnology institutees achievements on\ndisplay. The people in the city were\nmisled into believing that we woo would\nharm the Ming dynasty. But they knew\nvery well that we woo was wholeheartedly\ndevoted to the Ming dynasty. After\nlistening to what these people said, the\npeople in the city also noticed\nsomething was wrong. Just then,\nphysicians Sue glanced sideways at Lu\nSan Wu, then turned to Zhu Yuan Jang and\nsaid, \"Your majesty, you have heard it\nyourself. The so-called outstanding\ntalents Lu Sanu speaks of are nothing\nbut a group of thugs who forcibly broke\ninto other people's residences. Even if\nthe Earl of Chong Lee's methods were a\nbit harsh, it was only because he was\nfacing thugs and was worried about\nPrincess Wei Yangs safety. So, it was\nunderstandable. On the other hand, this\nMr. Lu San Wu, without even asking about\nthe facts, pointed the finger at the\nEarl of Changangle. He could be said to\nhave ulterior motives. I even suspect\nthat the forced entry into the Chong Lu\nMary's residence was deliberately\ninstigated by someone behind the scenes,\nand their intentions are despicable. At\nthis point, physician Sue turned to look\nat Wong Ergu. Ergu, tell me honestly,\nwas smashing the door your own idea, or\nwas someone telling you to do it? Upon\nhearing Physician Su's question, Wong\nErgu first glanced timidly at Zu Yuan\nJang, then gritted his teeth and said,\n\"Dr. Su, you know we're all peasants.\nEven if we had 10 times the courage, we\nwouldn't dare do such a thing.\" It was\nthat scholar who told me that if we\ndidn't catch the marquee of Chonglu, he\nwould definitely take revenge on us in\nthe future. They also said that the Earl\nof Chonglu was going to destroy the Ming\ndynasty and we would be back to a\nchaotic world with no clothes to wear,\nno food to eat, and children unable to\ngo to school. Upon hearing this, almost\neveryone present, unless they were\ncompletely stupid, understood what was\ngoing on. The so-called scholar was\nclearly adept at understanding human\nnature and had grasped Wong Ergu's\ndeepest fears. As a powerful and\ninfluential figure, we wu wanted to take\nrevenge on a commoner like Wong Ergu,\nbut he couldn't even put up a fight. Add\nto that those alarmist statements, and\nit's incredibly easy to incite a naive\nand ignorant commoner. After all, the\npeople are afraid of returning to the\nchaotic world and of losing their\ncurrent peaceful life. Ultimately, as\nlong as one person takes the lead, the\nothers will immediately follow, which\nleads to the current situation. After\nWong Ergu finished speaking, he\nimmediately turned around and looked\naround in the crowd, hoping to find\nScholar. After observing for a long\ntime, Wong Ergu still couldn't see the\nperson's figure, and now he panicked.\nThat scholar, he's gone. Your majesty,\nphysician Sue, I'm not lying. He was\njust here. If you don't believe me, you\ncan ask Jean Diu. I just saw him talking\nto Jean Dia too. Jeang Du, don't you\nthink so? Panicked, Wong Erggo looked at\nJeang Du then ran over and grabbed his\nsleeve with a look of fear on his face.\nJeang Du was afraid of being held\nresponsible, so he kept his head down\nand didn't dare to speak. Seeing this,\nZhu Yuan Jang understood what Jeang Du\nwas worried about and spoke directly.\nSpeak and we will pardon you, too. As\nfor the others, tell us what you know\nand we will pardon them all. Upon\nhearing Zhu Yuan Jang&lt;unk&gt;s words, Jeang\nDu had no more reservations and\nimmediately told him everything. After\nJeang Denu finished speaking, the\nsurrounding people chimed in one after\nanother, revealing everything without\nany concealment. They like Wong Ergu\nencountered that scholar. Although each\nof them heard different words from him,\nbut one thing is the same. The scholar\ngrasped what they cared about most. At\nthis point, even these ordinary people\nat the bottom of society realized that\nthey had been used. After realizing what\nhad happened, the people immediately\nsearched for the scholar who had spoken\nto them in the crowd. However, just like\nWong Ergu, this person could not be\nfound at all. Therefore, the people\nfocused their attention on the students.\nSince they were the ones who instigated\nhim to cause trouble, that scholar must\nhave been someone they brought along as\nwell. Seeing that the people were about\nto attack the students, physician Sue\nquickly stepped forward. To put it\nbluntly, these students are just pawns\nbeing used by others. Even if we kill\nthem all, it won't make a difference. In\nfact, if the people really start a riot,\nthe scene will definitely be chaotic.\nSince that's the case, it's better to\npush all the blame onto Lu San Wu. He's\nthe one who deserves it. Therefore,\nbefore the people could even voice their\nopposition, physician Sue took the\ninitiative to attack Lu San Wu. Lu San\nWu, you are a great confusion scholar of\nour time. Yet, you have such a vicious\nmind. You actually instigated the people\nto riot and forcibly break into the\nChong Lu Mars mansion. When things\ndidn't go your way, you actually\nresorted to the villainous act of\naccusing Chong Lebo of murder in the\nstreet. Have you wasted your time\nstudying the classics? Wayiw was stunned\nafter hearing what physician Sue said.\nHe was originally the person involved,\nbut after physician Sue arrived, he\ninexplicably became a bystander. And Lu\nSan Wu, the plaintiff, was actually\nforced into becoming the defendant. I\ncouldn't help but wonder, is this guy a\ndoctor or a lawyer? How could he be so\ngood at talking nonsense? In fact, not\nonly we Woo, but even Zu Yuan Jang and\nZhu Bao felt that it was a waste of Su\nTai's talents to be confined to the\nImperial Hospital after hearing this.\nThat's right. This old guy came in and\nimmediately started slandering the Earl\nof Chong Lu and then tried to leave\nright after he finished speaking.\nThere's definitely something fishy going\non. That's right. That's right. Luckily,\nMarquee Chonglu was quickwitted and\nstopped him. Otherwise, the old man\nwould have really escaped. How\ndespicable. They've used us time and\ntime again, then try to run away after\nusing us, leaving us to take the blame.\nThese scholars constantly spout the\nwords of sages. Yet, their actions are\nincreasingly vile and despicable.\nHearing the whispers of the crowd around\nhim, Lu San Wu felt a little panicked.\nIf he were allowed to continue, the\nreputation he had built up over his\nentire life would be completely ruined.\nBut would physician Sue give him a\nchance to explain? Obviously not. Just\nas Lu Sanu was about to speak, physician\nSue stepped forward again, pointed at Lu\nSan Wu, and shouted, \"Everyone, this Lu\nSanu is extremely vicious. I suspect he\nis a spy sent by the remnants of the\nYuan dynasty to sabotage the prosperity\nof our great Ming dynasty.\" The marquee\nof Changangle made many contributions to\nthe Ming dynasty, but he was indifferent\nto fame and fortune and was unwilling to\ntalk about these things. You don't know\nbut the enemy does. So they are envious,\njealous, and even go to great lengths to\nget rid of the Earl of Chong. Next, I\nwill recount all the things that Chong\nLebo did one by one, and you can judge\nfor yourselves. Chapter 178, the three\ngreat miracle drug announced. Public\nopinion completely reversed. Hearing\nphysician Sue's words, Lu Sanu became\neven more anxious. Just a moment ago, he\nwas the mastermind. And now he's become\na spy for an enemy country. This is\nsomething that will make him infamous\nfor eternity. If they don't speak up and\nlet physician Sue continue, these\ncharges might be confirmed.\nUnfortunately, things had come to this\npoint and the situation was completely\nbeyond Lu Sanu's control. Before Lu Samu\ncould speak, Zhuao had already discerned\nhis thoughts. Then without making a\nsound, he gave a look to someone and\nimmediately a burly man dressed in\ncoarse linen clothes rushed out of the\ncrowd. He came up to L Sanu and punch\nhim in the stomach without saying a\nword. L Samuel was after all just a\nscholar nearing 70. How could he\npossibly endure such excruciating pain?\nHe immediately clutched his stomach and\nknelled on the ground, his pale face\ncovered in sweat. His mouth was open,\nbut he couldn't utter a single word. He\ncould only let out painful groans. No\none expected this to happen. Just as\neveryone was stunned. The burly man who\nhad made the move spoke up. You bastard.\nNot only did you use us to harm the Earl\nof Chong Lu, you even dare to be a spy\nfor the remnants of the Yuan dynasty. I\nwill kill you, you treacherous dog, to\navenge my father who was killed by the\nMongol cavalry. As they were talking,\nthe young burly man was about to make a\nmove, but he was eventually stopped and\ntaken away by the guards. At this\nmoment, the surrounding people finally\nunderstood why this strong man had acted\nso impulsively, having also suffered\ngreatly at the hands of the Yuan and\nMongol dynasties. They expressed that\nthey could fully understand his actions.\nAfter this little incident, Lu Sam Wu\nwas temporarily speechless. The\ninitially agitated crowd quieted down\nand then they heard physician Seuss\nspeaking. Fellow villagers, you have\nprobably all heard that the Academy of\nSciences is showcasing its achievements\noutside the city today. I don't know the\nspecifics because I wasn't there, but\nsome people who were there probably went\nto see it. As soon as physician Sue\nimmediately stood up. The man was\ndressed like a wealthy merchant and upon\ncloser inspection, Weii Wu realized that\nhe was Huang Tianfong. He emerged from\nthe crowd accompanied by several men\ndressed similarly as wealthy businessmen\nand said, \"I saw it. I want to see it\ntoday. It's amazing, especially that\nthing called cement. It can be used to\nbuild houses and city walls as well as\nbridges and roads. It is not only flat\nand sturdy, but also resistant to rain\nand mud. In the future, our great Ming\ndynasty will surely have long and wide\nroads, and it will be more convenient\nand cheaper for us merchants to\ntransport goods. As soon as Hong Ton\nFong finished speaking, someone in the\ncrowd immediately chimed in. It's not\njust cement, but also the firearms\ndeveloped by Chong Lebo and the Academy\nof Science and Technology. They are\ntruly amazing. With these powerful\nfirearms, no foreign race will ever be\nable to enslave us again, and the Ming\ndynasty will surely prosper forever.\nSubsequently, more and more people spoke\nup, recounting everything they had seen\nand heard. After listening to what they\nhad to say, the people who had been\nmanipulated finally understood what we\nwoo had done. But that wasn't the end of\nit. At that moment, physician Sue spoke\nup again. Everyone, what you have heard\nnow is only part of the story. There are\nalso contributions that are directly\nrelated to you. Some time ago, our\nImperial Medical Bureau published a\nmethod for preventing smallox through\nthe Hayman Pharmacy. It's the method of\nsmallox vaccination. This method was\ntold to me by the Earl of Chonglu, and\nour Imperial Medical Bureau has already\nverified it. From now on, no one will\nhave to worry about themselves or their\nfamily members contracting smallox and\nlosing their lives. Furthermore, some\ntime ago, Uncle Chonglu came to me again\nand brought out the production methods\nfor three extremely rare drugs.\nSalicylic acid, allisonin, and\npenicellin. At this point, physician Sue\ntook out several items from his robes\nand then looked at someone in the crowd.\nOld Jang, your grandson contracted\nasthma two months ago and is coughing\nday and night has caused you two a lot\nof worry, hasn't it? The person named by\nphysician Sue had tears in their eyes\nupon hearing those words. My little baby\nis [snorts] the lifeblood of us old\nfolks, but he has contracted this\nterrible disease. We are so grateful to\nyou, Dr. Sue, for your help in\ndiagnosing and prescribing medicine.\nUpon hearing this, Physician Sue\nimmediately waved his hand. To my shame,\nI was unable to cure this terrible\ndisease. I could only prescribe some\nmedicine to suppress it and make the\nchild feel a little better. If I had met\nUncle Chonglu earlier and known how\nAllison is prepared, your child wouldn't\nhave had to suffer so much. But now it's\nall right. Take your child to Hayman\nPharmacy and I have a way to cure this\ndisease. Upon hearing physician Sue's\nwords, old man Jang immediately became\nexcited. Dr. Sue, you mean that the\nprescription given to you by the marquee\nof Changangle contains a treatment for\nthis ailment? That's right. I'll go get\nthe child right now. Upon receiving an\naffirmative reply from physician Sue,\nold man Jang turned around and ran away\nwithout saying another word. After he\nleft, physician Sue turned to look at a\nyoung man again. Yang Laoba. Half a year\nago, your father was transporting\nchamber pots when his thigh was\naccidentally cut by the wood of the\nchamber pot, leaving a 2-in long wound.\nNot long after, the wound began to\nfester and ulcerate. No matter what\nmedicine I prescribed, it was\nineffective. In the end, he died of a\npersistent high fever. If I had known\nhow to make penicellin back then, your\nfather wouldn't have died from an\ninfected and festering wound. At this\npoint, physician Sue took a deep breath\nbefore continuing. Everyone, the\nscientific path that Chong Lebo\nestablished at the Academy of Sciences\nis not about strange tricks or\nunorthodox methods, but about ways that\nbenefit the country and its people. As\nhe spoke, physician Sue pointed at Lu\nSanu again. I suspect Lu San Wu is a\nYuan Mongol spy because apart from\nenemies, I really can't think of anyone\nelse who would hate the Earl of\nChangangle so much. I don't know Lu\nSanu's background. If he's not a Yuan\nMongol spy, then his reasons for harming\nthe Earl of Changel are even more\nhateful. As physician Sue finished\nspeaking, he looked intently at the\nstudents of the Imperial Academy. The\nbirth of a new doctrine will inevitably\ndamage the status of the old doctrine,\nwhich is why it will be suppressed and\ntreated unfairly. Before today, the Earl\nof Changel have been assassinated\nseveral times, presumably because they\ndiscovered the power of science. They\nare afraid of being replaced by science\nand afraid of the decline of their own\ndoctrines, which is why they were so\neager to get rid of Chong Lebo. Upon\nhearing this, Wayi Wu couldn't help but\nlaugh. He hadn't expected that physician\nSue would include the assassination\nattempt in his account. However, upon\nhearing physician Sue's next words, Weii\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s smile vanished instantly. As\nyou probably guessed, only one person\nwould do something like this. FCan Su.\nBefore Physician Su could finish\nspeaking, Wayi Wu immediately\ninterrupted him with a loud shout. Upon\nhearing Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s outburst, physician\nSu was about to say something more when\nhe saw Crown Prince Zu Bowo slowly\nshaking his head. Left with no other\nchoice, he could only change the subject\nand say a few words to conclude the\nconversation. Fellow villagers, the\nMarquee of Changangle has devoted\nhimself wholeheartedly to the prosperity\nof the Ming dynasty and to your\nwell-being. Whether it's the Academy of\nSciences or those drugs, everything is\ndesigned to make our Ming dynasty\nbetter. Chapter 179. Zhu Yuan Jang. We\nhave lost a loyal minister. Let's give\nMinister Huang a proper burial. Even if\nphysician Sue hadn't said it aloud, most\npeople would have guessed what he meant.\nConfucianism. Why did Wei Wu and Zhu Bao\nboth stop Dr. Sue from continuing?\nBecause Confucianism was the dominant\nschool of thought in the world.\nCriticizing Confucianism would have too\ngreat a causal impact and physician Sue\ncould not withstand it. Thanks to their\nintervention, physician Sue did not say\nit directly. Otherwise, they will\ninevitably be condemned by scholars from\nall over the world, and some may even\ntake extreme actions. A pen can be a\nweapon sharper than a knife, and a human\nheart is the most vicious thing in the\nworld. In fact, we was also quite\nsurprised. Physician Sue was no fool. He\nwas well aware of the pros and cons of\nthe matter. However, knowing the\nconsequences, he still chose to make\nsuch a big fuss and even prepared to say\nit out loud. If it were just to help\nhimself, there would be no need to go to\nsuch lengths. Presumably, physician Sue\nhas his own motives. But that doesn't\nmatter. Everyone has their own secrets,\nand we woo won't pry. Thanks to Dr.\nSue's outburst. The situation is now\nlargely settled and public opinion will\nsoon be completely reversed. Those who\nwanted to destroy him through despicable\nmeans have had their plans completely\nthwarted. These people obviously won't\ngive up and will definitely think of\nother ways, but we won't give them a\nchance. The Lu family of Jang Nan, the\nnote, Hang Lang, the student, Lu San Wu,\nall these together. Weiiu was already\nconvinced that the Kong family of Sufu\nwas behind all these things. To be\nhonest, he really didn't expect the Kong\nfamily to set their sights on him just\nbecause I ruined their plans. Although\nofficial history did indeed unfold\naccording to their plan, the success\nrate of such a plan was actually not\nhigh. It can only be said that the Kong\nfamily was quite lucky. By sheer\ncoincidence, they actually accomplished\nhalf of their goal. Because Zhu Yunwan\nwas deposed by Zhu not long after he\nascended the throne. Even if such a low\nfeasibility plan is sabotaged, it's not\nworth risking trouble for yourself. Or\nis it really as physician Sue said that\nthe Confucious family feared their\nscience would replace Confucianism? To\nbe honest, with limited information,\nWayi Wu really couldn't guess why the\nKong family would cause him trouble. But\nsince he couldn't guess, he was too lazy\nto rack his brains since he was about to\nuse his knife on him anyway. As the old\nsaying goes, if you can't solve the\nproblem, solve the person who created\nit. Just as Wei Wu was deep in thought,\nZhu Yuan Jang, who had been silent all\nalong, finally spoke. Am we being too\nlenient? Right under our noses in this\ncapital city. Someone actually dares to\nincite the people to cause trouble. You\nthink our swords are dull? Where are the\nimperial guards? As soon as Zu Yuan Jang\nfinished speaking, several Imperial\nguards dressed in flying fish robes came\nout. Take Lu San Wu into the Imperial\nprison and interrogate him severely. We\nneed to find out who ordered him to do\nthese things and also arrest all\nstudents who incite the people to cause\ntrouble since you don't want to study\nproperly. Then wait until your next\nlife. Upon hearing Zhu Yuan Jang&lt;unk&gt;s\nwords, the young students were all\nterrified. Lacking any life experience,\nthey only thought that the law wouldn't\npunish everyone and never imagined that\nthings would escalate to this point. If\nthey had known it would turn out this\nway, they would never have gotten\ninvolved. Unfortunately, that's just how\nthe world is. You can't by foresight\nnow. They can only reap what they sow.\nAs the menacing looking Imperial guards\napproached, most of the students\ncollapsed to the ground in terror. A\nsmall number of students looked\nashen-faced, slumped to the ground, and\ntheir crotches were soaked with sweat.\nDespair, resentment, and regrets swirled\nin their hearts. However, at this\ncrucial moment, Zhuao, the crown prince,\nsuddenly spoke up. \"Father, as far as I\nknow, this incident was instigated by a\nstudent named Yao Chiian at the Imperial\nAcademy. The other students are young\nand ignorant and have been misled by\nthem. I believe that only the ring\nleaders should be punished and the rest\nshould be given appropriate punishment.\nUpon hearing Zhu Bao's words, the\nstudents present immediately saw a\nglimmer of hope for survival. They all\nlooked at Zu Bao with hopeful eyes as if\nthey were seeing a living Buddha. Seeing\nthis, Wayi Wu chuckled inwardly. That\nwas a great charade. As expected, Zhu\nYuan Jang immediately rejected Zhu Bao's\nsuggestion with a cold face. But Zu Bao\npersisted until the father and son\nalmost got into a fight in front of\neveryone. In the end, Zhu Yuan Jeang\ncompromised, only punishing those\nstudents from the Imperial Academy who\nleft the school without permission.\nStudents from other external schools\nwere only punished with a few strokes of\na cane. In reality, they would have only\nbeen punished in the first place, but\nnow they're expected to be grateful to\nZuao. As for the students at the\nImperial Academy, in ChowChow's view,\ntheir fate was already sealed. No one\ncan plead for them, and any smart person\nwouldn't plead for them anyway because\nthese people are of different natures.\nThe Imperial College is a state-run\nuniversity and an important breeding\nground for officials. These students,\ndespite being students of the Imperial\nAcademy, led the disturbance, and there\nwere clearly others instigating it. In\nthis situation, Lau certainly wouldn't\nkeep them. He'd take this opportunity to\nget rid of a bunch of them. The\nremaining ones are unlikely to have any\nproblems, and we can continue to\nincrease our training efforts based on\ntheir individual talents in the future.\nJust when we woo thought the matter was\nover, and there would be no further\nchanges, a member of the Imperial Guard,\nrushed in from outside the crowd and\nknelt down in front of Zhu Yuan Jang.\nYour Majesty, Imperial Sensor Hang Lang,\nhanged himself at home. Before he died,\nhe left behind a few last words. He said\nthat the Duke of Changangle founded the\nAcademy of Sciences for the country and\nthe people, but he himself was unable to\ndistinguish right from wrong and almost\nruined the country. He has failed his\nmajesty's trust. I have no face to face\nthe marquee of Chongl. Only by dying can\nI atone for my sins and make myself feel\nbetter. unable to face me. Will you die\nto atone for your sins and ease your\nconscience? Is this still the Hang Lang\nI know? How would he say something like\nthat? Upon hearing these words from the\nembroidered uniform guard, Weii Wu&lt;unk&gt;s\nworldview was utterly shattered.\nHowever, upon closer reflection, it's\nlikely that Huang Lang's story has been\nembellished. As for who it was, Wei\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s gaze immediately turned to\nwhere Old Ju was. When he saw the pain\nand regret in old Zu&lt;unk&gt;s eyes, he knew\nhe hadn't guessed wrong. Then Zhu Yuan\nJang slowly closed his eyes. And when he\nopened them again, his eyes were red.\nHow could Minister Huang be so unwise?\nOur great Ming has lost a loyal minister\nwho dared to speak frankly and offer\nhonest advice. We are heartbroken.\nEnough. Enough. Order a proper burial\nfrom Minister Hong. I'm on a good mood\nright now. Let's head back to the palace\nwith the Earl of Chong Lu accompanying\nus. With Zu Yuan Jang&lt;unk&gt;s order, the\nincident of forcibly breaking into the\nEarl's mansion was finally resolved. The\nstudents involved were taken away by the\nguards and punished accordingly while\nthe common people dispersed. I believe\nthat the public opinion surrounding Weii\nWu will soon reverse. After the crowd\ndispersed, Weii Wu said a few words to\nhis family and then followed Zhu Yuan\nJang to the function hall. Upon entering\nthe palace, Weiu was about to inquire\nabout Hang Lang when Zhu Yuan Jang spoke\nfirst. You want to ask about Huang Lang,\nright? Well, that guy wouldn't say such\na thing as his last words. Uncle Zu,\nyour story is way too far-fetched. You\nthink I want this? Zu Yuan Jang replied\nirritably, then took out an envelope and\ntossed it to Wei Wu. Chapter 180. Ideas\non building a generator. Your subject\nwill die to remmonstrate. Looking at the\nthree neatly written words on the\nenvelope, Weii Wu was speechless. He\noriginally thought that Zu Yuan Jang had\nsent people to do it. But now it seems\nthat there's something else going on. If\nit was old Ju who did it, there wouldn't\nbe such a suicide note. Could it be that\nHang Lang really hanged himself? If\nthat's the case, then he really is a\nshameless jerk. His mind is full of\nnothing but remmonstrance. He would bang\nhis head against a pillar in court to\nremmonstrate with the emperor or hang\nhimself at home, leaving behind a letter\nto remmonstrate with the emperor. But\nthat doesn't make sense. It was related\nto his involvement in the student\ndisturbance. And he was afraid of being\nimplicated, imprisoned, and even\ntortured. The worst that can happen is\nsuicide. Why leave a suicide note? Do\nyou want to leave behind a clean\nreputation? Just as Weii Wu was filled\nwith doubt, Zhu Yuan Jang spoke up and\ntold the truth. Huang Lang was murdered\nat home. This suicide note was found on\nthe table next to him. The killer was\nafter you. The person who did was\nmeticulous and skilled, managing to\nevade the surveillance of the\nembroidered uniform guard and kill Huang\nLang. If it weren't for the coincidence\nof being discovered by the Imperial\nGuards on guard when I left, this\nsuicide note would probably have been\nleaked. Huang Lang was killed, but it\nwasn't done by someone sent by Zu. After\nlistening to Zhu Yu and Jang&lt;unk&gt;s\nwords, we Wu frowned slightly, picked up\nthe will, and opened it to examine it.\nThe contents of the suicide note were\nsimilar to what Huang Lang said when he\nhit the pillar, only the wording was\nmore sharp. In addition to criticizing\nWeii Wu, there was also some\ndissatisfaction with Emperor Xu Yuan\nJang. Normally, it wouldn't cause much\nof stir, but if combined with his act of\nhanging himself, the effect would be\ncompletely different. After reading the\nwill with a gloomy face, we wu turned to\nlook at Zhu Yuan Jang. Uncle Zu, has the\nperson who did the attack been caught?\nZu Yuan Jang slowly shook his head. We\ncaught him, but it's no use. He was a\nsuicide soldier. He killed several\nImperial guards. And when he saw that\nthings were not going well, he swallowed\npoison and died on the spot. After\nhearing what Zhu Yuan Jang said, Wayi\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s first thought was of the\nConfucian family. There are many\nfamilies in the world capable of\ntraining assassins, but few dare to get\ninvolved in this matter at this time.\nOnly the Confucian family makes the most\nsense. Otherwise, he couldn't think of\nanyone else who would have such\naudacity. Thinking to himself, Wei Wu\nturned to look at Zhu Yuan Jang, only to\nfind that he also had a gloomy face.\nIt's likely that they shared the same\nidea as me. Just then, Zhu Yuan Jang\nspoke up, confirming Wayi Wu&lt;unk&gt;s\nguess. Shia Wu, we also think that plan\nyou talked about with Bower last time is\ngood. Let's do it the way you want.\nUncle Zu, does this mean you agree to\nlet me leave the capital? Weii Wu&lt;unk&gt;s\neyes lit up and he tentatively asked a\nquestion. After which Yu Yuan Jang\nconfirmed, \"That's right. We agree, but\nyou can't lack the necessary protection.\nWe'll arrange for a 100 Imperial guards\nto follow you. These people are just\nprotecting us from the shadows. Just\npretend they don't exist. You can order\nthem to show themselves when needed.\nThis trip out of the capital is\nextremely risky. We will give you\nanother Imperial edict. Seeing the edict\nis like seeing us. You can mobilize\n10,000 troops nearby. Upon receiving Zhu\nYuan Jang&lt;unk&gt;s reply, Wayi Wu\nimmediately burst into laughter. He\ndidn't really care about whether or not\nthe embroidered uniform guard was in\ncharge. He had his own impermanent\nsquad. The impermanent squad of the\nembroidered uniform guard can do it. And\nthe impermanent squad can do it even if\nthe embroidered uniform guard cannot.\nThe key is this Imperial edict which\nallows for the mobilization of 10,000\ntroops from nearby areas. That's the\nmost powerful thing. If this imperial\nedict had been issued by a late Ming\ndynasty emperor, Chow Chow would have\neasily thrown it into the trash. Local\nmilitary officers in the late Ming\ndynasty would not give the emperor any\nface. They might just kill him without\nhesitation. But now is the beginning of\nthe founding of the nation and the\nmajesty of Zhu Yuan Jang, the founding\nemperor is evident. Throughout the\nentire Ming dynasty, no military officer\ndared to outwardly comply with but\ninwardly disobey this imperial edict. I\nwas already full of confidence for this\ntrip. And now I'm even more certain of\nit. Don't worry, Uncle Zu. Whether it's\nthe White Lotus sect or Sufu, I\nguarantee I'll handle this perfectly. Zu\nYuan Jang pressed his hand down, then\nshook his head and said, \"It doesn't\nmatter if this matter doesn't work out.\nIf it doesn't work out, just come back\nto the capital. Do you remember what you\ntold us? In the future, the goal of our\ngreat Ming is the endless sea. We will\nhave plenty of opportunities to deal\nwith the mere white lotus sect and the\nKong family. Remember, your safety is\nthe most important thing. Treat this\ntrip as a sightseeing trip. Whether you\nget the business done or not is up to\nyou. Although Zhu Yuan Jang said so,\nWayi Wu still wanted to get the job\ndone. For no other reason than what\nhappened today, this family has no\nreason to exist. Of course, he still had\nto give a proper response to La Zu&lt;unk&gt;s\nconcern. Uncle Zu, please don't worry. I\ncherish my own life very much.\nZu Yuan Jang nodded, then changed the\nsubject and asked about the exhibits the\nAcademy of Sciences had displayed that\nday. Xiao Wu, what is the production\nvolume of that rifled flint lock musket\nthat was shown today and those two\ncannons? When can they be equipped for\nthe entire army? Knowing that Zu Yuan\nJang would ask, Wayi Wu immediately gave\nthe answer. Equipping the entire army\nmight be a bit difficult. There are no\nproblems with materials and manpower,\nbut the main difficulty is in\nmanufacturing. When it comes to\nprecision machining, although it could\nbe done by hand, it is time consuming\nand labor intensive and there is no way\nto guarantee whether the precision meets\nthe standards. The machine tools I\nbrought out all require electricity and\nthe ones I have at the moment cannot\nprovide a continuous power supply.\nWayiwoo's solar panels can produce 3\nkwatt hours of electricity per day, even\nunder conditions of abundant sunshine.\nPortable power banks can only store a\nmaximum of 20 kwatt hours of\nelectricity, which is insufficient even\nfor everyday household appliances.\nPowering industrial machines like\nmachine tools is simply a joke. Even\nsupplying power to just one machine is a\nstretch, let alone the several machine\ntools in the science institute. After\nthis period of exposure, Zhu Yuan Jang\nhad gained some basic understanding of\nelectrical appliances and electricity.\nAfter listening to Wei Woos explanation,\nhe frowned and pondered for a moment,\nthen asked another question. Then, can\nwe find a way to generate electricity?\nDidn't you tell me about some kind of\ngenerator before? Does it generate\nelectricity? After Zhu Yuan Jang\nfinished speaking about Weii Wu, he fell\ninto deep thought. Indeed, if we can\nenter the era of basic electricity, then\neverything we do will be much more\nconvenient. However, you can't just\nenter this place whenever you want. At\nthe very least, certain prerequisites\nmust be met. Electricity is indeed a\ndifficult thing to work with because the\ndifficulty lies in its principles. If\nyou don't understand the principles,\nyou'll just be wasting your time. It is\nsimple in fact because it is easier to\nimplement than the steam engine. The\nprinciple of a generator is\nelectromagnetic induction. By rotating\nbetween magnets and cutting magnetic\nfield lines, mechanical energy can be\nconverted into electrical energy.\nHowever, to achieve this, you first need\nmagnets. And the more magnets connected\nin series, the greater the voltage. The\nproblem is that ordinary natural magnets\nwon't work. To make a generator, you\nneed strong magnets. Thinking of this,\nWayi Wu suddenly muttered something to\nhimself. Looks like I'll have to find a\nway to get struck by lightning a few\ntimes. Upon hearing this, Zhu Yuan\nJang&lt;unk&gt;s expression immediately\nchanged. Chapter 181. arrangements\nbefore leaving the capital. It's not\nsurprising that Zhu Yuan Jang reacted\nthis way. The idea of trying to get\nstruck by lightning is incredibly\nshocking in today's world. Shiao Wu, if\nit's really too difficult, we can skip\nbuilding the generator, but you\nabsolutely mustn't risk yourself by\npersonally triggering the lightning.\nWhen Wei Wu came to his senses, he was\nboth amused and exasperated by Zhu Yuan\nJangs words. How could I be so reckless\nas to personally draw lightning? If you\nget struck by lightning, you'll either\nbe lucky enough to be transported to\nanother world or unlucky enough to leave\nthis world. Thinking of this, Wayiu\nquickly began to explain. Uncle Zu, you\nmisunderstood what I meant by letting\nlightning strike. It was not that. I\nmeant creating the conditions for\nbuilding a generator. To make a\ngenerator, one of the most crucial\ncomponents must be subjected to\nlightning strikes. It has to be said\nthat Weii Wu&lt;unk&gt;s explanation sounded\neven more fantastical. But fortunately,\nZhu Yuan Jang didn't think too much\nabout it this time. Okay, you can decide\nwhat to do yourself as long as you don't\nput yourself in danger. Leave the\ndangerous tasks to others. After\nspeaking, Zhu Yuan Jang paused for a\nmoment before continuing. Also, you'd\nbetter keep a low profile this time you\nleave Beijing. Neither Bowerer nor I\nhave told your aunt. Uncle Zu, don't\nworry. I know what to do and won't let\nAnnie worry. That's fine then. Go pick\npeople from Maang side later. Wayi Wu\nnodded, but just as he was about to\nleave, he suddenly remembered something.\nBy the way, Uncle Zu, regarding the\nsteam engine issue, the Academy of\nSciences will begin designing a model\nsuitable for large ships. However, this\nrequires the cooperation of an\nexperienced ship builder, and I need you\nto issue an order to transfer personnel\nfrom the Navy to the Academy of\nSciences. The issue of steam ships was\nalways a matter of great concern to Zhu\nYuan Jang. He couldn't wait to build the\nship immediately and then go to the\nJapanese pirates to bring back his\nSilver Mountain. They would not hesitate\nat all when faced with Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s\nrequest. Don't worry, we'll send someone\nto the Navy later and they'll be at the\nAcademy of Sciences in a few days. Then\nI'll go to the Academy of Sciences and\ntell them. After leaving the palace, he\nfirst went to the embroidered uniform\nguard and found Maang in the guard post.\nActually, the personnel issue can be\nleft to Maang. The main thing is to give\nthe other party a heads up. The 100\nImperial guards accompanying the group\ncould be chosen from among anyone, but\nthe leader specifically named Jon Hao.\nAfter all, they had been through some\nthings together, and Jean Hao would\nlisten to him when it mattered most.\nAfter leaving the garrison, we wu rushed\nto the Academy of Sciences without\nstopping. Originally, the craftsmen at\nthe Science and Technology Institute had\nprepared a celebration banquet because\nthe results of the demonstration were a\ngreat success. As a result of Weii\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s arrival, their victory\ncelebration had to be temporarily\nsuspended, and they followed Wayi Wu to\nthe classroom. However, the craftsman\nhad no complaints about this because\nwhenever Chow Chow summoned them to the\nclassroom, it was always because he had\nnew knowledge to impart to them. Seeing\nthe curious looks on the faces of the\ncraftsman below, Wei Wu cleared his\nthroat and said, \"Everyone, I will be\nleaving Beijing for a while, and the\naffairs of the Academy of Sciences will\nbe temporarily managed by Seang.\" From\nthe very beginning of the Academy of\nSciences, Weii Wu has been the core and\nbackbone of the entire academy.\nEverything was progressing steadily\nunder his guidance. But now, suddenly,\nwe wu said he wanted to leave. The\ncraftsmen were inevitably a little\nuncomfortable. But Seang, who was called\nupon by Wei Wu, immediately stood up.\nVestein, could you please tell us\napproximately how long we will be gone\nso we can prepare accordingly? Without\nyou, we would be without a leader and we\nwouldn't know who to ask for advice when\nwe encounter problems. Upon hearing\nthis, we woo waved his hand. When you\nencounter a problem, you should try to\nsolve it. Scientific research will\ninevitably encounter difficulties, and\nthere are some problems that even I may\nnot understand. What you need to do is\nto study and study even more. You will\nonly feel a sense of accomplishment when\nyou overcome the difficulties on your\nown. I believe you can do it. You should\nknow that I only gave you the blueprints\nfor the steam engine. How to make it and\nhow to make it better was up to you to\nfigure out, wasn't it? At this point,\nWayi Wu paused for a moment before\ncontinuing. By the way, his majesty will\nsend experienced ship builders over in a\nfew days to assist you in designing the\nsteam engines for your large ships.\nConsider this the task I'm giving you\nbefore I leave. I hope you can give me a\nsurprise when I come back. Seong and Sun\nChong exchanged a glance, then nodded\nsolemnly and said, \"Please rest assured,\nVice Dean. We will definitely not let\nyou down.\" Wayi Wu nodded, then looked\nat Sun Chong alone. Sun Chong, you've\nall seen the machine tools I brought out\nbefore. Tell me your thoughts first.\nUpon hearing Wei Wu mention machine\ntools, all the craftsmen present widen\ntheir eyes, eager to share their\nthoughts. Unfortunately, Weii Wu is now\nasking Sun Chong. Vice Dean, that\nmachining tool is simply a marvel. It's\nincomparable to human power. Cutting\nmetal is just like cutting tofu. It can\nbe shaped in one go, and the processing\nprecision is so high. If it were a\ncraftsman making it by hand, it would\nnot only take a lot of time, but we\nmight not even be able to meet the\nrequirements of the parts. At this\npoint, Son couldn't help but let out a\nlong sigh. Unfortunately, it needs\nelectricity to operate and the only\npower source the institute has is your\nportable power bank which can provide it\nwith limited power. If we had other\nmeans of generating electricity, whether\nit was making a steam engine or\nsomething else, it would be a piece of\ncake. The thought that industrial\nmachine tools could not become a regular\nmanufacturing method made Sun Chong look\nat way Woo. Dean, you mentioned before\nthat this portable power bank converts\nsunlight into electricity using solar\npanels. Could we manufacture solar\npanels to supply power to these\nindustrial machine tools so they could\nbe used normally? Wayiw looked at Sun\nChong with a rise smile, inwardly\ncomplaining. You really have a wild\nidea. We haven't even figured out\nthermal power generation yet, and you're\nalready thinking about solar power.\nAren't you afraid of damaging some\ndelicate and fragile organ by taking\nsuch big steps? But despite the\ncomplaints, Wayiu really did come here\nto solve the electricity problem.\nTherefore, immediately after Sun Chong\nfinished speaking, he said, \"Forget\nabout utilizing solar energy, that's\nsimply not a technological field we can\ncurrently engage in.\" Hearing this\nanswer, Sun Chong couldn't help but feel\nquite disappointed. But at that moment,\nWayi Wu&lt;unk&gt;s next words gave him hope.\nYou just want electricity, don't you?\nI'm here today to give your blacksmith\ngroup a very important task. Once you\ncomplete the tasks I've assigned, we'll\nhave the prerequisites for building the\ngenerator Dynamo. Upon hearing this\nsimple and straightforward name,\nSunshang's eyes practically lit up with\nexcitement. What task is it, Vice Dean?\nJust tell us. Our blacksmith team will\ncomplete it even if we have to work day\nand night. Having already guessed that\nSun Chong would react this way. Weii\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s lips curled into a playful\nsmile. It's very simple. just get struck\nby lightning dozens of times. Huh? This\nThis chapter 182. Strong magnets and\nturbine hydroelectric generators. Ha.\nSeeing the bewildered look on Sunchang's\nface, Wayi Wu couldn't help but burst\ninto laughter. All right, I was just\nkidding. I'm not asking you to get\nstruck by lightning, but rather to make\nsomething that will get struck by\nlightning. As he spoke, Wayi Wu flipped\nhis wrist and took out two toy magnets\nfrom the system space. You've all heard\nof magnets, right? They're like poles\nthat repel each other and opposite poles\nthat attract each other. So, they have a\ncertain attraction to metals. As we woo\nspoke, he held the load stone in his\nhand and demonstrated how to handle it.\nAlthough the craftsman may not have all\ncome into contact with it, they're not\nunfamiliar with magnets. Although the\nload stone in Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s hand had a\nrather strange shape, it had the same\neffect. Just as everyone was looking at\nthe load stone, Weii Woo spoke again.\nThe most crucial element in making a\ngenerator is a magnet. But the kind of\nnaturally minded magnet won't work.\nNatural magnets are not strong enough\nand their power generation is not ideal.\nSo it is necessary to artificially\ncreate stronger magnets with better\nperformance. Electricity and magnetism\nare naturally inseparable. So making\nstrong magnets requires electrical\nenergy. The kind of extremely strong\nelectrical energy. After listening to\nwhat we woo said, Sun Chong had a flash\nof inspiration. Dean, so when you said\nyou wanted to be struck by lightning,\ndoes that mean all you need to do is\nstrike iron with lightning to turn it\ninto a strong magnet? Yes and no. We\nwill gave a simple reply. Upon hearing\nthis answer, Sunsh once again showed a\nlook of confusion. Yes and no. So, is it\nor isn't it? Just then, Wayi Wu spoke up\nagain to explain. Lightning alone is not\nenough. We need to use the energy of\nlightning to create a strong magnetic\nfield to magnetize the ferroagnets. How\ncan we use lightning to create the kind\nof magnetic field you described? After\nhearing wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s explanation, Sun\nChong couldn't wait to ask. Weii Wu\nsimply replied with two words, \"Gupit\nwife.\" After saying that, Wayi Wu\ncontinued to explain. First, make a cast\niron block and then wrap the copper wire\naround the cast iron block in a\nright-hand spiral motion. This is very\nimportant. At this point, Wayi Wu gave a\nbrief explanation of the right- hand\nscrew rule. Actually, these theories are\nnot difficult. They're covered in high\nschool physics textbooks. For now, we\njust need to let the craftsman know what\nto do. As for why to do it this way, we\ncan study that later. After explaining\nthe right-hand screw rule, Wayiu went on\nto talk about the making of strong\nmagnets. Remember, copper wire must be\ninsulated, which means first applying\nresin varnish to the copper wire. This\nis called enamelcoated copper wire.\nBecause cast iron is also a conductor,\nonce the bare wire comes into contact\nwith the cast iron, the current cannot\nform a magnetic field to magnetize the\ncast iron. After doing all that, all you\nneed to do is tie the cast iron block to\nthe top of the wood and stick in a spot\non the mountaintop where it's likely to\nbe struck by lightning. The craftsman\nbelow the stage listened attentively\nwhile taking notes on what we woo said.\nAfter everyone had stopped writing, we\nwu continued to make a generator. Strong\nmagnets are the most crucial element,\nand the more the better, so they can be\nused as spares later. So after I leave\nthe capital, you should do as I said and\nmake more cast iron blocks that need to\nbe magnetized in advance. Whenever\nthere's a thunderstorm, just take them\nout, keep them at a distance, and wait\nfor them to be struck by lightning. As\nsoon as we Woo finished speaking, Sun\nChong immediately expressed his opinion.\nDon't worry, Vice Dean. Our blacksmith\nteam will definitely handle this matter\nwell. We'll be able to make the\ngenerator as soon as you return. Yes, I\nbelieve you can do a good job. Weii Wu\nresponded with a sentence, then turned\nto look at Wu Chong. Wu Chong, regarding\nthe generator issue, besides the\nblacksmith group being responsible for\nthe strong magnets, your construction\ngroup also has a task. I need you to use\nsteel and cement to find a good location\non the riverbank and build this\nbuilding. I call this a turbine\nhydroelectric power station. It can\ngenerate electricity using flowing\nwater, so it must be built on the\nriverbank. As he spoke, Wayi Wu picked\nup a pen and began to draw on a piece of\npaper hanging on the wall behind him.\nBut what he was really thinking was that\nhe would have to get the chalk and\nblackboard out later, which would be\nmuch more convenient. Before long, Wayi\nWu drew a building that resembled both a\nnumber six and a musical note. See, just\nlift this valve baffle and the water\nwill flow in and reach this circular\nposition. At the bottom center of this\nlocation, we need to build a turbine\nlike a propeller to use the water flow\nto make it rotate and generate\nelectricity. However, there are no\nstrong magnets right now. So, your\nconstruction team just needs to\nfamiliarize themselves with how to build\nthis structure first. At this point,\nWayi Woo made a special emphasis.\nBecause we need to utilize the potential\nenergy of the water flow, you must\nremember that the best location to build\nis a low-lying area. There needs to be a\ncertain drop between the inlet and\noutlet to effectively utilize the water\nflow. Do you understand? Wu Chong nodded\nsolemnly, keeping Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s words\nfirmly in mind. Seeing how serious he\nwas, Wayi Wu&lt;unk&gt;s face showed a\nsatisfied expression. Then he looked at\nthe other craftsmen below the stage.\nLadies and gentlemen, the advent of the\nsteam engine means that we have entered\nthe steam age where we no longer need to\nrely on human and animal power. But this\nis just the beginning. I must tell you\nthat if we can work together, we can\nbuild the generator. Then under the\nleadership of our Academy of Sciences,\nthe Ming dynasty will officially enter\nthe electric era, a brand new era. An\nera that terrified foreign tribes and\nwas envied by neighboring states where\neven a thousand years from now, humanity\nwill not be able to escape the need for\nelectricity. And you at this point, Wayi\nWoo raised a finger and swept it across\nthe craftsman. You will be the creators\nof this era. And together with the\nAcademy of Sciences, you will be\nremembered for eternity, becoming\nfigures revered by future generations.\nNo one, including internet users and\nlater generations, doesn't want to be\nremembered for eternity. Even if each\nfamily's genealogy only had a single\npage, it would be enough to excite them\nto fight the Japanese to the death. The\nsame principle applies to these\ncraftsmen. So after Wayi Wu finished\nspeaking, these people became as excited\nas if they had been injected with\nchicken blood. After all, they had\nalready built the steam engine. It\nturned out that we woo had never made\nempty promises to them. If the steam age\ncould be realized, the electric age can\ncertainly be realized as well. In the\nfuture, they will surely be remembered\nin history. Just like the ancient sages,\neven Xiao Xiao, a man from a later era,\nwas thrilled to have created this era\nwith his own hands. How could these\nartisans not be excited? But at that\nmoment, Seong suddenly stood up and\npoured a bucket of cold water on his\nhead. Dean, whether it's a large steam\nship or a powerful magnet and turbine\ngenerator, a lot of manpower is needed.\nOur research institute is short staffed\nright now. Chapter 183. Sweet boss's\nsnowflake candy makes a fortune. Upon\nhearing Jong&lt;unk&gt;s words, the craftsmen\nall realized what was happening. Indeed,\nmanpower is a very critical issue during\nthis period. In order to showcase their\nachievements, they've been working\nnon-stop, so busy that they barely have\ntime to breathe. The Academy of Sciences\noriginally didn't have much to research\nand it could barely keep operating. But\nthen more and more things came up and\nthey became more and more complicated\nand manpower became a major problem. The\nkey issue is that this problem cannot be\nsolved simply by transferring personnel\nas many things are classified. Moreover,\nif a few of those old-fashioned stubborn\npeople from before were to come, the\natmosphere of the Academy of Sciences\nwould be ruined. In the end, Wayi Wu\npondered for a moment and could only\noffer a clumsy solution. Here's what\nwe'll do. You can search among folk\nartisans, preferably young, energetic\napprentices who are eager to learn\nskills. Your friends, even those in the\nsame industry, are fine, but you need to\nbe careful about their character. They\ncan't be a menace. Whether you send them\nor arrange for them to be apprentices or\nassistants, you can observe their\nabilities. Seong, send the personnel\nlist to my house. I will have my wife\nsend the list to the palace. That's the\narrangement for now. Although it wasn't\na perfect solution, it was still a\nmethod and the group leaders all nodded\nin agreement. After dealing with matters\nat the Academy of Sciences, by the time\nWei Wu came out, it was already dark.\nJean Hai, who had been waiting outside,\nsaw Wayu come out and immediately drove\nhis carriage dam. Young master, are we\ngoing home next? After Jean Hai finished\nspeaking, Weii Wu glanced at the orange\nsun on the horizon and sighed inwardly.\nI'm so busy I barely have time to\nbreathe. I rushed home from the\nriverbank then went to the palace and\nthen came to the Academy of Sciences. I\nhave to meet with those wealthy\nbusinessmen later tonight. I don't even\nhave time to catch my breath. Thinking\nof this, Wayi Wu shook his head and then\nsaid, \"Don't go home. Go to the High\nChow Shang building first.\" Oh, and\nsince I want to find Ching Xia and ask\nher to go there, too. After saying that,\nWayi Wu climbed directly onto the\ncarriage, lifted the curtain, and sat\ninside. After entering the sedan chair,\nWayi Wu leaned back in his seat to rest,\nand soon fell asleep. Although, I could\nstill feel the carriage jolting in my\ndrowsy state. I was finally able to\nclose my eyes and rest for a bit.\nHowever, this rest period didn't last\nlong before Jean Hai woke her up by\ncalling her name. Young master, we've\narrived at the High Chowing building.\nMiss Ching Xia has come out to greet\nyou. With a simple reply, we wu lifted\nthe sedan curtain and stepped down from\nthe carriage. Ching Xia who had been\nwaiting at the door immediately stepped\nforward to greet him. Young master, all\nright, let's go inside and talk about\nit. With a casual wave of his hand, we\nwu led Ching Xia into the Behi Chowing\nbuilding. Although it was smashed by\nKing Xhuang ofQin last time, the main\nstructure was not damaged and was\nquickly repaired. Even now, the Beehive\nChowing building is much more luxurious\nand magnificent than it was before it\nwas smashed. After all, money can make\nthe devil turn the millstone in this\nworld. And the key is that way Woo\ndoesn't need to pay for the repairs. On\nthe second floor of the Behigh Chowing\nbuilding, there's a private room\nspecially decorated for receiving\nguests. Please sit down. After entering,\nwe woo casually gave an order and then\npllopped down in the main seat. How's\nbusiness at the sugar workshop? Upon\nhearing we wu mention the workshop,\nChing Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s eyes immediately\nbrightened. Excellent. Now all the\npowerful and wealthy in the capital are\nconsuming our snowflake candy and they\nbuy six or seven caddies a time. Other\nlandlords and wealthy merchants are also\nfollowing the example of nobles and vine\nto buy. And these past few days, we've\nbeen making more than 2,000 tales of\nsilver in profit every day. It has to be\nsaid that the fastest way to make money\nin this world besides robbing is to do\nmonopolistic business. Therefore, after\nhearing Ching Xia's description, Wayiu\nwas not surprised at all. In the Ming\ndynasty, one gene was equal to 16 leong.\nThe powerful and wealthy would buy six\nor seven gene at a time, which would\namount to about 100 leong. There are so\nmany powerful and wealthy people in the\ncapital that more than 2,000 tales of\nsilver a day is not really an\nexaggeration. After all, it's in its\nnovelty phase now. Once the novelty\nwears off, the sugar market will become\nsaturated and prices will drop. However,\nin Weiwoo's view, even if the price is\nlowered, the daily profit will not be\nless than a thousand tales. After all,\nwhite sugar is a consumable, especially\nin this era of scare seasonings. Young\nmaster, our family sugar workshop is now\nso profitable that it's no exaggeration\nto say it's making a fortune every day.\nWealthy merchants in the capital call me\nboss suite. Seeing Chinga's joyful\nexpression, we wu also smiled. Bridget\nLynn had never been this lively at home\nbefore, so it was clear that pushing her\nout was the right thing to do. Although\nwhite sugar is a best-selling product,\nanyone who operates it can make money.\nHowever, she gained the approval of\nwealthy businessmen in Beijing and was\ngiven the nickname sweet boss. This is\nenough to show that Bridget Lynn is\nquite capable. As Wayi Wu was pondering\nthis, Ching Xia spoke up again. However,\nrecently there have been many strangers\nloitering around the workshop and some\npeople have even asked our craftsmen for\ninformation. Yesterday, two workers said\nthey were quitting. They must have been\npoached by someone with money.\nFortunately, they were just from the oil\nextraction workshop. Moreover, the\nchannel was cut off and these two\nworkers only knew that lust was used in\nthe sedimentation process, but they\ndidn't know that we were using Ben\nKnight. Wayiwi was not surprised at all\nupon hearing this news. Any profitable\nbusiness will inevitably attract envious\npeople who want to get involved and get\na piece of the pie. He never intended to\nmonopolize the sugar business forever\nsince the production method couldn't be\nkept secret forever. He had already\nthought this through. He planned to have\nold Jew draft the patent law first. Only\nthen would he reveal the method for\nmaking white sugar and seek cooperation\nwith wealthy and powerful merchants in\nother bustling cities. Just like with\ncement, he only contributes the\nproduction method as a stake and the\nprofits will be split at least 50/50ths.\nOf course, this is based on the premise\nthat patent law is enacted and he has\nalready made his fortune. At this stage,\nhe'll chop off anyone who dares to try\nand get into the sugar business.\nTherefore, after Ching Xiao finished\nspeaking, Wayiu immediately spoke up.\nDon't worry. After tonight, no one\nshould dare to cause trouble openly. At\nmost, they'll just covet it in secret.\nAt this point, Wayi Wu turned to look at\nthe room door again. Jean Hai, come in\nhere for a moment. The next second, the\ndoor to the room was pushed open, and\nJean Hai quickly walked up to Wei Wu.\nYoung Master Wayi Wu nodded and\ncontinued, \"Someone has their eye on\nyour family sugar making workshop. Send\nsomeone to the headquarters of the\nembroidered uniform guard to give them a\nheads up. Those guys who have ulterior\nmotives in the dark, just ask them to\ntake care of it.\" Upon receiving Weii\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s instructions, Jean Hai\nimmediately turned and left the room to\nsend someone to make arrangements. After\nJean Hai left, Wei Wu looked at Ching\nSha again. Ching Xia, the main reason I\ncalled you here is to give you support\nand let outsiders know about your\nbackground. Secondly, it's also to give\nyou more responsibility. A group of\nwealthy businessmen will be coming over\nto talk to me about building a cement\nworkshop later. You're also involved in\nthis business, but not for the purpose\nof making money. It's just to facilitate\nmy subsequent arrangements. Besides,\nthis matter is also beneficial to you.\nAt this point, Wayi Wu paused for a\nmoment before continuing. Benefits that\ncan change your life. Although she was\nvery curious about what the benefits\nwould be, Ching Sha was smart enough to\nknow not to ask what she shouldn't ask.\nWhen the time is right, my young master\nwill naturally tell me. Chapter 184a\nmessage that could change her lives. In\nfact, Wayiu didn't need to get involved\nin the cement business, but he figured\nhe might as well take advantage of any\nbenefits he could. This was also to pave\nthe way for the imperial court's\nsubsequent bidding process. Once the\nwealthy merchants have set up their\ncement workshops, Prince Yin Zhu will\nsoon be ready to put out bidding.\nHowever, this approach is somewhat ahead\nof its time, and it's not certain that\nanyone will step forward to respond.\nWayi Wu planned to have Ching Sha take\nthe lead and secure a section of the\ncity wall as the first tender. As for\nthe cost, you can just pay from home\nsince building a city wall is different\nfrom building roads later. In the\nfuture, road construction will be funded\nby contractors themselves, and the\nImperial Court will set a quota for them\nto collect tolls and build post\nstations. The construction of the city\nwalls was funded by the Imperial Court\nand paid to contractors. Although the\ngoal is to reduce costs, there is real\nmoney to be made and the money will be\nrecouped in the end. The key point is\nthat way Wu received the news from crown\nprince Zubao and in order to encourage\nwealthy merchants to participate he\ndecided to the bidding process for the\nconstruction of the city wall involved\nfive sections which were subcontracted\nto five different wealthy merchants.\nOldju will set aside two erdoms as a\nreward for the person who submits the\nlowest bid, the best quality bid and the\nmost efficient bid. This is also a way\nto get wealthy businessmen used to the\nbidding process, which will make it\neasier for them to bid on road\nconstruction in the future. Given such\nobvious benefits, Wayi Wu would\ndefinitely choose to benefit his own\npeople. All we need to do is manipulate\nthings behind the scenes and take one of\nthe titles and give it to Ching Xia. The\nonly female countest in the future Ming\ndynasty will be his Way Woosmaid, who\ncame from his household. It will be a\ngreat honor to talk about it. However,\nthe imperial court will have strict\nregulations for this construction of the\ncity wall, stipulating that only cement\ncan be used as the adhesive for the\nbricks. Therefore, it is very necessary\nto set up a cement plant. Other cement\nworkshops need to split their profits\n50/50ths with the science institute, but\nChing Xiao cement workshop does not. The\ncement needed to build the city wall can\nbe supplied at cost price. As for the\n50/50 split with the Academy of\nSciences, he himself is the head of the\nAcademy of Sciences. So, who would dare\nto say a word against it? Knowing that\nthe cement workshop belongs to Wei Woo,\nthe Academy of Sciences might even\nproactively fund the construction of the\ncement workshop for him. Just as Weii Wu\nandQing Shia were talking, there was a\nknock on the door and Yin Hongs voice.\nMaster, many wealthy merchants have come\nfrom outside saying that you sent them.\nI sent them. bring those people up.\nSubsequently, led by Yan Hong, a group\nof wealthy businessmen whose physiques\nindicated they were rich, arrived at a\nprivate room on the second floor. There\nwere about 20 of them in total, and the\nleader was a wealthy businessman named\nHuang Tianfo. When they first entered,\nthese people were a little reserved.\nAfter all, their status was vastly\ndifferent from Wei Woos. In any dynasty,\nthe rich could never defeat the\npowerful. Even if we woo did not hold\nany official position, he could easily\ndestroy these people simply by virtue of\nhis status as a count and a son-in-law\nof the emperor. Not to mention the\nincident of freshly graduated students\nforcibly breaking into the Earl's\nmansion. Hundreds of students from the\nImperial Academy were imprisoned and\neven the renowned scholar Lu San Wu\ncould not escape this fate. Anyone with\na modicum of common sense knows just how\nhighly we woo was regarded by the\nemperor. Everyone present was a wealthy\nbusinessman with a fortune. No one who\ncould achieve this level of success in\nbusiness was a fool. However, after a\nbrief moment of restraint, their eyes\nwere immediately fixed on Ching Shia.\nMany people present recognized this\nwoman. The snowflake candy that has\nrecently become popular in Beijing was\nmade by her. To their surprise, bossuite\nalso came this time and even arrived\nearly. The key point is that boss Tion\nwas sitting right next to Wei Wu. And\nthe significance of this is worth\npondering. Just as the wealthy merchants\nwere speculating, Weii Wu raised his\nhand and pointed to the surrounding\nseats. Please, everyone, have a seat.\nUpon hearing Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s words,\neveryone found seats and sat down. After\neveryone was seated, Weii Wu spoke\nagain. Now that you're here, you must\nalready know the conditions for\ncooperating with the Academy of Sciences\non cement, but I'd still like to confirm\nthis. The Science and Technology\nInstitute can share the cement\nproduction formula with you, but it will\nnot pay for the construction of the\ncement workshop. In the future, the\nprofits from cement production will be\nsplit 50/50 with a research institute.\nYou can all accept that, right? Just as\nwe woo said, those who come to the\nBeehive Chowing Building are all people\nwho know the situation. They knew these\nwere the conditions, but they still\ncame. So after Wayi Wu finished\nspeaking, no one's expression changed.\nSeeing this, we wu then continued\nspeaking. Very good. Now I will tell you\nthe second requirement, which is that\nthe cement plant must ensure that it is\nprofitable every month. Moreover, the\nprofits in the first year must show an\nupward trend every month. Otherwise, the\nright to use the cement formula will be\nrevoked. The main purpose of doing this\nis to ensure that you don't take the\nformula and then open your own private\nworkshops for profit. Those who can\naccept this can stay and those who\ncannot can leave now. Don't worry,\nbusiness is business and I won't make\nthings difficult for you. To give them\ntime to consider, Wayi Wu reached for\nthe teacup on the table. I used the lid\nto stir the tea leaves on the surface of\nthe cup and then took a small sip. As\nexpected, upon hearing the requirement\nto generate monthly profits, five\nwealthy businessmen immediately stood\nup. They first bowed to Wei Wu before\nturning and leaving the room. Only then\ndid Weii Wu put down his teacup and look\nat the remaining people. To those who\nstay, I must make this clear from the\nstart. Do not try anything funny. The\nAcademy of Sciences is not one you can\nmess with. I'm merely the vice president\nof the Academy of Sciences. As for the\nreal president, I'm sure you all have a\nguesses, so I won't say. If I find out\nthat someone is profiting from the\nformula privately, it won't be the\nyammen runners coming to my door, but\nthe embroidered uniform guard. After we\nwoo finished speaking, the wealthy\nmerchant, who had some ulterior motives,\nalso got up and left. In the end,\nincluding Bridget Lynn, only nine\nwealthy businessmen remained in the\nroom. Although the number of people was\nsmall, way is not worried at all since\nnot everyone could only open one\nworkshop. As long as you're willing to\nput in the money, one person can open\nseven or eight rooms without any\nproblem. Therefore, after confirming\nthat there would be no changes to the\npersonnel, Wayi Woo immediately raised\nhis hand to applaud them.\nCongratulations to all those who remain\nfor you will earn a great fortune\nbecause of your decision. At the same\ntime, I will also tell you two pieces of\nnews related to cement. one of which is\nenough to change our lives. Upon hearing\nthis, the wealthy businessmen present\nimmediately perked up their ears, their\neyes filled with curiosity. Seeing the\nexpressions on their faces, Wayi Wu\ndidn't keep them in suspense and spoke\ndirectly. You all know that the Imperial\nCourt is building city walls, but I want\nto tell you that the Imperial Court will\nannounce some news next. First, there is\nthe construction of a city wall. The\nimperial court will divide it into five\nsections and contract them out to\nprivate merchants for construction and\ncement will be designated by the\nimperial court as a necessary condition\nfor building the city walls. You should\nunderstand what that means. Upon hearing\nall lit up. How could they not\nunderstand? Once the imperial court\ndesignates cement as a necessity, they\nselling it. Just as everyone was\nexcitedly discussing, we woo spoke up\nagain. Don't get too excited yet.\nThere's more life-changing news coming\nyour way. Chapter 185. The 4C's Chamber\nof Commerce is established, and the\nsystem delivers another set of\ncontainers. Upon hearing this, the room\ninstantly fell silent. The wealthy\nmerchants, who were just moments before\nin a state of excitement, now all stared\nwideeyed at Wei Wu. They originally\nthought that way Woos talk of changing\ntheir lives meant that cement would make\nthem more wealthy. Now, a single\nsentence has overturned their\nconjecture. If even this doesn't count\nas a life-changing event, then what we\nWoo is about to say can only be\ndescribed as explosive. At that moment,\nWayi Woo also spoke up. The Imperial\nCourt's decision to contract out the\ncity wall to wealthy private merchants\nwas actually aimed at promoting a brand\nnew business model. bidding. That is,\nthe imperial court provides specific\nprojects and acceptance standards and\nprivate merchants compete to see who can\nwin the project. In order to promote\nthis model better, his majesty plans to\nset aside two titles to reward the\nperson who performs the best in the\nproject. When the wealthy merchants\npresent heard that Zhu Yuan Jang had\nactually offered up a noble title, they\nall gasped in astonishment. No wonder we\nwoo just said something that could\nchange their lives. scholars, farmers,\nartisans, and merchants. For them who\nwere merchants of the lowest social\nstanding, to receive a noble title would\nbe an immense honor for their ancestors.\nSo after Wei Wu finished speaking, these\npeople were so excited that their whole\nbodies trembled. They dared not make a\nsound for fear of disturbing Weii\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s next words. The room was so\nquiet you could hear pin drop. Ching Xia\nsitting next to Wayi Wu finally\nunderstood what the benefit Wei Wu was\nreferring to was. Compared to the other\nbusinessmen, Ching Xia was the most\nexcited one in the room. Throughout\nhistory, very few women have been\ngranted titles, but now she has that\nopportunity. Just as everyone's emotions\nwere reaching a fever pitch, we woos\nvoice rang out from the room once again.\nThe specific evaluation criteria are\nlower cost, higher efficiency, and\nbetter quality. Only two out of five\ncontractors will be selected. If any of\nyou have enough financial resources, you\ncan certainly try to participate in the\nbidding. After all, you have an\nadvantage. Others need to buy cement\nfrom you to build city walls, but you\nonly need to pay the cost price for\ncement. At this point, we woo to give\nthem time to process what he had said,\npicked up his teacup again and took a\nsip. He then put down his teacup after a\nwhile and continued. Furthermore, I can\ntell you that the imperial court's main\ndirection going forward is construction\nwith large-scale use of cement in\nconstruction. So, even after the city\nwall is completed, you don't need to\nworry about the cement not selling.\nYou'll only make more and more money.\nIt's no exaggeration to say it's a\ngolden goose. As long as you have the\nright to use the formula, you can keep\nmaking money. The more way Woo spoke,\nthe more excited the merchants became.\nSome even blushed with excitement. But\nat that moment, Wayi Wu abruptly changed\nhis tone, saying in an icy voice,\n\"However, there's one thing I must\nremind you of. I'm telling you this\ninformation in advance as a reward for\nyour staying behind. But these are all\nsecrets of the Imperial Court. If anyone\nwere to leak this information, you all\nknow what would happen to them.\" Upon\nhearing Wei Woos threat, the wealthy\nmerchants were not afraid at all.\nInstead, they all eagerly spoke up. Lord\nChanlu, you can rest assured. We would\nlove to keep such a good thing to\nourselves, and no one would be foolish\nenough to spread the word. That's right.\nOf course, we should keep the benefits\nto ourselves. If word gets out, we'll\njust be creating competitors for\nourselves. That's right. If anyone dares\nto spread this news, we will all make\nsure they pay without the imperial court\neven having to lift a finger. As\neveryone began to speak, Hong Ton Fong\nstood up abruptly. Everyone, the Earl of\nChong Lu has taken such a great risk to\ntell us this news, giving us a chance to\nsoar to new heights. If anyone dares to\nact recklessly, even if the Earl of\nChonglu were here, I would say that I,\nHuang Tian Fong, will definitely have\nsomeone kill the leaker. In addition, to\nensure that everyone supervises each\nother, I propose that we form a chamber\nof commerce using cement as a link. At\nthis point, Huang Tian Fong first bowed\nto Wei Wu before continuing. The reason\nwhy Uncle Chong Lu told us all this was\nprobably to promote that new business\nmodel and at the same time to give us\nsome pointers. In the future, the\nImperial Court will definitely have more\nbidding projects and our financial\nresources will certainly not be enough\nto support just one of them. But if we\nform a chamber of commerce and help each\nother, those projects will be able to\ncompete with others in the future. After\nspeaking, Huang Tian Fong looked at Wayi\nWu again, bowed, clasped his hands, and\nsalute, and said, \"I propose that this\nChamber of Commerce be named the Chong\nLu Chamber of Commerce. I humbly invite\nthe Earl of Chong Lu to be the first\npresident of the Chamber of Commerce.\nFrom now on, the nine of us will follow\nclosely behind Lord Chonglu. Whatever\nyou say, our chamber of commerce will\ndo. Although Hong Ton Fong didn't say\nexplicitly, no one present was a fool.\nWho was Wei Wu? He's the vice president\nof the Academy of Sciences. They had\nseen the research results from the\nAcademy of Sciences, and they were all\ngreat things that could change the\nworld. Just by producing a single piece\nof cement, these people could make a\nfortune. If we can really establish a\nchamber of commerce and forge a\nrelationship with wei Wu, there will\nsurely be countless benefits in the\nfuture. So after Hong Ton Fong finished\nspeaking, the others immediately stood\nup and echoed him. Looking at the people\nin front of him, Wayiu knew perfectly\nwell what they were thinking. However,\nhe didn't mind this at all. On the\ncontrary, he was quite satisfied with\nthe result since the sea ban would be\nlifted sooner or later with a chamber of\ncommerce. future overseas trade can be\nexpanded as quickly as possible. So\nafter a moment of contemplation, Weii Wu\ngave his answer. Establishing a chamber\nof commerce is a good idea, but I will\nnot serve as the president. I will leave\nit to Huang Tian phone. In addition,\nChing Shia, who you call boss suite,\nwill become a member of the Chamber of\nCommerce as my spokesperson. At the same\ntime, I can promise you that the chamber\nof commerce will have a certain priority\nin choosing any new product from the\nAcademy of Sciences in the future.\nHowever, the name of the Chamber of\nCommerce should not be Chonglow.\nInstead, it should be called Seih High\nChamber of Commerce, which means wealth\nfrom all corners of the world. Upon\nreceiving Weii Wu&lt;unk&gt;s reply, the\nmerchants seemed to envision a future\nwhere they would be the richest people\nin the world. They were so excited they\nalmost jumped up. Next, Weii Wu and the\nothers formulated some rules and\nregulation for the Chamber of Commerce.\nThey also designated the Beehive Chowing\nBuilding as the headquarters of the\nChamber of Commerce, and the businessmen\ntalked until late at night before\ndispersing. After all the merchants had\nleft, we woo prepared to go back to\nrest. But then I suddenly remembered\nthat I hadn't opened the package for\ntoday, so I decided to just open it\nfirst. The system has been unreliable\nlately, always sending him random,\nnonsensical messages, which has made him\nlose interest. I hope the system will\ncooperate today and not send me any more\nlow temperature candles or whips. As he\nmuttered to himself, the scene and way\nWoos eyes transformed into the system\nwarehouse. Looking at the three packages\nfloating in the air, he immediately\nchose the largest one. In a flash, a\nblack shipping container appeared in the\nwarehouse. Another container. Last time\nit was industrial machine tools. This\ntime they'll probably bring something\ngood, too. Forget it. Let me check what\nthe system gave me this time before\ngoing back to sleep. After dismissing\nhis attendance, Wayi Wu went alone to\nthe backyard of the Beeh High Chowing\nbuilding. Chapter 186. Intercepting the\ndesert tycoon's delivery. Clang. The\ncontainer was taken out of the system\nwarehouse and slammed onto the ground\nwith a loud thud. It's always like this.\nCan't you be a little quieter? What if\nthere's something valuable inside and\nyou break it? While complaining about\nthe flaws in the systems warehouse\ncollection function, Wayi Wu casually\nopened the container door. Inside the\ncontainer were rows of black boxes,\nroughly the size of shoe boxes. Then\nnear the gate of the container, there\nwas another identical black box, but\nmuch larger. It was about the size of a\nwashing machine with a flat silver white\nsuitcase on top of the box. Weii Wu\nopened the silver briefcase with some\ncuriosity and found that it contained a\nlaptop computer. Meanwhile, a\nbeautifully crafted envelope was placed\non the computer keyboard. Having opened\nso many packages over the past year,\nthis was the first time Weii Woo had\never seen something like this in a\npackage. Since this thing couldn't be\ndelivered to where it was supposed to go\nanyway, we woo decisively open the\nenvelope. This is a typed letter and the\ncontents are written in two different\nlanguages. One is Arabic script which\nlooks like gibberish but fortunately the\nother is Chinese characters. Your\nmajesty the king. After only glancing at\nthe beginning Wu was completely\nconfused. Was this container a gift for\nthe king? And it's even written in\nArabic script. Could this thing have\nbeen bought by some nuvo ree in the\ndesert? With these thoughts in mind, we\nwoo continued reading. Your majesty,\nthank you for recognizing our company's\nproducts. Following the last drone\ndemonstration, our products have been\nupgraded once again. Not only does the\ndrone have a longer flight time, but it\nis also equipped with a special AI\nintelligent control system, making it\nconvenient for you to try operating it\nyourself. The signal equipment and\nflight control system have been\nprecisely calibrated by us. You only\nneed to connect your computer to the\nsignal equipment. Input the screen or\nimage you want to display into your\ncomputer and then use simple control\ncommands. The AI system will\nautomatically analyze the task and then\ncontrol the drone according to the\ninstructions. Thank you for your\nrecognition. We hope to cooperate with\nyou again. Company name. After reading\nthe entire letter, Wayi Woo smile was\nharder to suppress than an AK. If\nnothing unexpected happens, this XX\ncompany should be the same team that\nperformed drone demonstrations in the\ndesert before. To be honest, Wayiu was\nso satisfied with the delivery the\nsystem sent this time that he almost\njumped for joy. If it were just a\nregular drone, of course, it wouldn't be\nthat bad. But this is a swarm of drones.\nMoreover, the letter clearly stated that\nthis was an upgraded new product from\nthat company. The key is that everything\nis already set up. It's basically a\nfoolproof operating method, so you can\nstart playing as soon as you get your\nhands on it. As the old saying goes,\ntiming is everything. He was just about\nto leave the capital to pretend to be a\ncharlatan for the White Lotus sect when\nthe system sent him some good stuff.\nEven in later generations, this drone\nshow can still be incredibly exciting.\nNot to mention this era where there is\nabsolutely no technology as long as\nthese drone swarms are put into flight.\nEven if we woo claim to be the Buddha\nincarnate, the followers of the White\nLotus sect would believe him without a\ndoubt. No. Once I've infiltrated the\nWhite Lotus sect, I absolutely must give\nthem a taste of the great mighty\nheavenly dragon. As he spoke, Wayi Wu\nopened several black boxes and checked\nthe drone's battery level. Only after\nconfirming that all drones were fully\ncharged did they confidently move the\ncontainer into the system warehouse. In\nfact, Wayiu really wanted to try out the\neffects of this thing right away.\nHowever, the drone's battery life is a\nlimitation. If it runs out of power in\none go, charging it will be a hassle.\nMoreover, it's best not to reveal such a\nmiraculous scene before infiltrating the\nWhite Lotus sect. Nothing happened\novernight, and it really happened.\nBecause of the effects of taking the\nheli san, a traditional Chinese medicine\nformula. Wayu had not been able to use\nhis skills late at night for a long\ntime. Unfortunately, this cursed drug\ntakes effect every night, and its\npotency is incredibly strong. A young\nman full of vigor on a night when he\nshould be surrounded by tenderness was\nunable to sleep due to the throbbing\npain. His veins were bulging and he\nlooked like a dragon with its head held\nhigh in anger. Yet he didn't make a\nsingle move towards his beautiful wife.\nThis made Ju Yusuan think she had done\nsomething wrong and she was secretly\nheartbroken. Fortunately, Weii Wu\nnoticed that she was in a bad mood,\nexplained for a long time, and then\nverified it several more times during\nthe day. That's how I managed to appease\nZhu Yuwan. And today is no different.\nAfter getting up from the limp, Zhu\nYuwani Wu gently kissed his wife's\nforehead and said softly, \"I might not\nbe back for several months after leaving\nBeijing this time, so I'll be relying on\nyou to take care of things at home.\"\nZuyushuan looked at Weii Wu with\nreluctance. Although she was unwilling\nto leave her husband, she did not want\nto become an obstacle to him. Don't\nworry, my husband. I will definitely\ntake good care of the household. At this\npoint, the hospital patient slowly moved\nhis body and rested his head on Wei\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s shoulder. My husband, let's\nhave a child after you come back. In\nfact, we wu felt helpless when he heard\nthis request. During this period, Zhuan\nhad actually brought it up several times\nindirectly. But Wayi Wuhang had fooled\nher every time. But now that she's asked\ndirectly, Wayi Wu can no longer pretend\nto be stupid. To be honest, he certainly\nwants children, whether they are boys or\ngirls, and he's willing to have as many\nas he wants. Anyway, we have a large\nfamily and can afford to support them.\nIt would be best if we could have a\nwhole football team of children.\nHowever, childbirth is physically\ndemanding, and in this era, women can\nonly give birth naturally. This is no\ndifferent from passing through the gates\nof hell. Umbilical cord entanglement,\nmalposition of the fetus, excessively\nlarge fetus, maternal exhaustion, and\nsevere bleeding. Any of the above\nproblems could lead to the death of both\nmother and child. Moreover, Zhuwan is\nonly 18 years old. Although her age is\nnot a problem, her body has not fully\ndeveloped yet. The original plan was to\nwait until she turned 20 before\nconsidering having children. However, in\nthis era, a woman who has no children\nafter marriage will be the subject of\ngossip and slander, and Zu Yushwan is\nunder a lot of pressure. Seeing the\nexpectant look in Zu Yuan's eyes, Wei Wu\nYusuan, let's discuss this properly when\nI get back. Don't overthink it. I do\nwant a child. Seeing that Wayu was no\nlonger pretending to be stupid, Xiuan\nbreathed a sigh of relief. Finally\ngetting a positive response from Wayi\nWu. After calming his wife down, Wayi Wu\ngot up, dressed, washed up, and left the\nroom. He left Beijing quietly this time,\nnot intending to take anything with him,\nnot even a change of clothes. Anyway, I\nhave the money, so I can just buy it\nlater. Besides, I don't lack anything in\nthe system space. Upon arriving at the\nstable, Jean Hai and three members of\nthe impermanent squad had already\nprepared the carriage for their journey.\nHowever, just as We Wu was about to get\ninto the carriage. He heard Jean\nHa&lt;unk&gt;s voice behind him. L Chong Lu,\nwait a moment. A letter has been sent\nfrom the headquarters garrison. It says,\n\"It came from Yong Joe and must be\ndelivered to you.\" Upon hearing Jean\nHa&lt;unk&gt;s voice, we wu paused in his act\nof getting into the car. A letter from\nYong Joe that must have been brought\nback by Shinllin. After taking the\nletter from Jeang Hao and confirming\nthat it hadn't been opened, Weii Wu\nopened the envelope. However, after\nreading the contents of the letter, his\neyebrows rose and his eyes were full of\namusement. Lu Yao, the owner of\nSongbella and Yong Joe, is quite the old\nfox. He actually has a secret\nillegitimate child that no one knows\nabout. This kid insists on seeing me.\nCould it be that he wants to avenge that\nold bastard Lou E? Chapter 187. In the\nfirst night after leaving the capital,\nencountering a monk in black. Actually,\nthe letter Shinllin sent back contained\nvery simple information. Previously, Wei\nWu had deduced the contents of the note\nand sent it to Yong Joe based on a\nmessage sent by Wei Wu. Shinl\nimmediately began a detailed\ninvestigation and indeed found a man\nnamed Lu Yao. Combining the note he\nreceived from the Lu family with Wei\nWu's guess, Shinllin immediately deduced\nsomething. He was originally considering\nwhether to take direct action to arrest\nthe man and bring him back to the\ncapital to see Wayi Woo. Or perhaps we\nshould first send a message to the\ncapital to see if there are any\ninstructions from Wei Woo so that we can\nact accordingly. Before he could make a\ndecision, Lu Yao ran into trouble. A\nfire broke out without warning and set\nthe Song tower ablaze, trapping the\nowner, Lu Yao, inside. If Shan hadn't\narranged for his team to monitor Song by\nTower early on, Lu Yao would probably\nhave been burned to ashes on the spot.\nFortunately, Shunlin had made\narrangements in advance, and the fire\nwas detected as soon as it started.\nShunlin led the impermanent squad to\nstorm Sombi Tower and rescued the\nunconscious Lu Yao from the fire.\nShinlin initially thought it was just an\naccident until he discovered the truth\nbehind Lu Yao's coma. At first, he\nthought Lu Yao was asleep and then\npassed out from the smoke. Lu Yao was\nbreathing smoothly and had no problems.\nHe just couldn't wake up no matter how\nmuch he was patted. Only then did\nShunlin realize that something was wrong\nbecause Lu Yao's condition seemed more\nlike that of someone who had been\ndrugged. To confirm his suspicions, Shan\nhad someone boil licorice and ginger in\nwater and give it to Lu Yao. Sure\nenough, not long after taking the\nmedicine, Lu Yao slowly woke up.\nContrary to Shan Linn's expectations, Lu\nYao did not panic after waking up and\nremained very calm. It was as if he\nalready knew he would encounter this\ncalamity and was actually quite curious\nas to why Shenllin and the others wanted\nto save him. Shan didn't reveal anything\nat first until Lu Yao himself said it.\nSaving me is tantamount to killing\nyourselves. Those who want me dead are\nnot people you can fight. Upon hearing\nthis, Shanlin immediately thought of the\nthings Weii Wu had specifically\ninstructed him to do before they set\noff. He was tasked with investigating\nwhether the Lou family was colluding\nwith the White Lotus sect or secretly\nconnected with the Confucious family in\nSufu. Now, what Lu Yao said has\nconfirmed this point. So, Shinlin\ndirectly revealed his identity as a\nand the matter concerning the note.\nHowever, he was careful not to mention\nthat the impermanent squad had\nexterminated the Lu clan. It was only\nsaid that he was ordered to investigate\nthe Smallox case and that Lu E hang\nhanged himself when he was about to make\nthe arrest. Thanks to Lugu's reminder,\nthe coroner found a note in the man's\nabdomen during the autopsy, which led\nthe investigation to Yong Joe. However,\nafter Shan Lllin finished speaking, Lu\nYao did not continue the conversation,\nbut instead revealed his own identity.\nHe not only revealed that he was Lu Yi's\nillegitimate son, but also admitted that\nhe could tell everything. But the\nprerequisite is that he must meet the\nperson behind Shenllin before he can say\nit to his face. Shenllin couldn't figure\nout what Lu Yao was thinking. But since\nLu Yao had already said so much, he\ncouldn't pretend to be stupid. The\noriginal plan was to bring Lu Yao back\nto the capital, but no matter what\nShinllin said, Lu Yao wouldn't\ncooperate. He also stated that it was\nsafer inside YongJo city and that once\nthey left the city, those people would\nhave no scruples. If Shan Linn dared to\nuse force, he would do everything he\ncould to end his life since he would die\nanyway if he went out. Left with no\nother option, Shan had to use the\nembroidered uniform guard channels to\nsend the letter back, awaiting Weii\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s instructions. To be honest,\nafter reading this letter, Wayi Wu also\nbegan to feel a little curious about Lu\nYao. Since we'll have to meet up with\nSha Lin eventually, let's go to Yanjo\nfirst and then head to Shandong. After\ncarefully placing the envelope away, Wei\nWu turned to look at Jean Hao. Jean Ha,\nI'll have to trouble you to take care of\nhim again when you leave Beijing.\nRemember to tell your brothers about it\nlater. You can be more generous with\nyour food, clothing, and other expenses\nthis time. Just ask me to reimburse you\nfor all expenses after you return to\nBeijing. Jang Hao and Wei Wu were old\nacquaintances, and Jang Hao knew that\nWeii Wu never looked down on others\nbecause of his status. Moreover, they\nare generous and lavish, even towards\nsmall fry like them. So, after Wei Wu\nfinished speaking, he did not refuse,\nbut replied with a smile. Then, I thank\nUncle Chong Lu on behalf of those poor\nbrothers. Don't worry, we will\ndefinitely protect your safety. We're\nold acquaintances. I trust that much.\nSo, let's go. Yes. Having received Wei\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s instructions, Jang Hao turned\nand left immediately. His mission this\ntime was to protect Wei Wu in secret. He\nwas not to show himself without Wei\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s orders, nor would he speak to\nWei Wu on his own initiative. After Jean\nHao left, Jean Hai began to call on the\nmembers of the impermanent squad to set\noff. And so not long after dawn, we wu\nquietly left Inkion Prefecture in a\ncarriage. It's impossible not to be\nexcited about leaving the capital for\nthe first time, although the carriage\nhad not traveled very far, not even\nreaching the riverbank. But we woo,\nsitting in the sedan chair, would\noccasionally lift the curtain and glance\noutside. Fortunately, once the novelty\nwears off, all that's left is boredom.\nYang Joe is actually not far from the\ncapital. If you calculate the straight\nline distance, it is about 150 lee.\nHowever, there were no direct highways\nin ancient times, so it was necessary to\ngo around mountains and rivers, so the\nactual journey would not be less than\n200 m. Fortunately, Beijing is the\ncapital city and the road conditions in\nthe surrounding area are much better\nthan in other places. After a day's\njourney, the carriage had traveled about\n70 lee or about 35 km. However, since it\nwasn't a smooth cement road, Wayi Wu\nfelt somewhat tired after a day of bumpy\ntravel in the carriage. Fortunately,\nbefore nightfall, they finally entered\nthe town and found an inn to stay at.\nAfter arranging the carriage and feed,\nthe inkeeper led we woo to his room.\nUpon entering, I was greeted by a musty,\nrotten smell, and the interior\nfurnishings appeared rather rudimentary.\nBut you can't expect too much when\nyou're traveling. At least it's a place\nto stay. After settling into their\nrespective rooms, Wei Wu led Jean Hai\nand the other three to the lobby on the\nfirst floor to prepare for dinner. Just\nthen, a monk dressed in black walked in\nfrom outside the inn. In fact, Wayi Wu\nhadn't noticed it at first, but he\nturned his head to look at it after\nseeing Jean Hai glancing at him\nfrequently. Normally, monks wear brown\nor khaki robes, but this monk was\nwearing a black robe. This reminded Weii\nWu of a man, the black rogue prime\nminister Yao Guang Xiao, who was later\nknown as the evil monk of a chaotic era.\nHowever, he was just thinking about it\ncasually since the chances of randomly\nencountering a monk who turn out to be\nYao Guang Xiao were slim. There are many\nmonks in the world, so it's normal for\nothers to like wearing black. However,\njust as Wei Wu was thinking this, the\nblack robed monk walked directly towards\nhim. Upon seeing this, Weii Wu&lt;unk&gt;s\neyes narrowed slightly, but he quickly\nregained his composure. Just then, the\nblackroed monk walked up to his table\nand said in a gentle tone, and with a\nkind expression, \"Esteemed, sir, this\nhumble monk has traveled a long way and\nis now extremely hungry, may I ask you\nfor some food?\" After the black robed\nmonk finished speaking, Weii Wu&lt;unk&gt;s\nface remained unchanged, but he was\nsecretly thinking to himself. Judging\nfrom the situation, they're coming for\nme. Chapter 188. Pretending to be a\ncharlatan, Yao Guang Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s defenses\ncrumble. He muttered something to\nhimself. Just as Wei Wu was about to say\nsomething, the shopkeeper's impatient\nvoice came from aside. Where did this\nstinky monk come from? Go beg for food\nelsewhere. Why are you coming in here\nand disturbing our customers? As he\nspoke, the shopkeeper stroed toward the\nblack robed monk, waving his hand as if\nto drive him away. But at this moment,\nWeii Wu suddenly spoke up. \"It's all\nright. It's just a vegetarian meal.\nShopkeeper, go prepare a vegetarian dish\nfor him and put on my tab.\" Seeing that\nwe woo had spoken, the shopkeeper\nstopped thinking about kicking people\nout. As long as he could make money,\nthat was all that mattered. However,\njust as he turned to arrange the\nvegetarian meal, the black robed monk\nspoke up. This humble monk does not\nabstain from meat, so the shopkeeper\nneed not worry about whether it is\nvegetarian or not. Is fine to arrange\nsome wine and meat dishes. This humble\nmonk loves to eat chicken legs. Upon\nhearing what the black robed monk said,\nthe shopkeeper gave him a disdainful\nlook. Not only does he shamelessly\nfreeload, but he's also a drunkard and a\nmeat eatating monk. Shaking his head and\nmaking a complaint, the shop owner\ndidn't dwell on it any longer and\nimmediately went into the kitchen. After\nhe left, the blackroed monk\nunceremoniously sat down at Wei Woos\ntable. To make such a rude, even\noffensive gesture and still looked so\nnatural. Neither his expression nor his\neyes showed the slightest hint of\nembarrassment. Based on his calm and\ncomposed demeanor, Wei Wu could be\ncertain that he was Yao Guang Xiao\nwithout any surprise. But after\nrecognizing the person, Wayi Wu became\neven more puzzled. Shouldn't this guy be\ntrying to bewitch? Why is he standing in\nfront of me? I'm just an earl, not a\nprince. Why would he give me a white\nhat, too? Just as Wayi Wu was filled\nwith doubt, the blackroed monk spoke.\nThis person has an extraordinary\nappearance with a spiritual light\nshining from their celestial spirit.\nTheir background and future achievements\nare quite remarkable. Oh, I didn't\nexpect you, this wine and meat monk, to\nactually know the arts of physioamy and\nfortuneelling. Do you know how to make\ncalculations? Upon hearing what the\nblack robe monk said, we wu smiled\nslightly and then casually replied.\nSeeing way Wu smile, the blackrobe monk\nalso smiled. This humble monk is\nproficient in the art of physioamy and\nface reading, but only has a rudimentary\nunderstanding of the methods of\ncalculation. You claim to be an expert\nin physioamy and face reading, but I\ndoubt you're more than that. Upon\nhearing this, the black robed monk's\neyebrows twitched slightly just as he\nwas about to say something. Weii Wu\nspoke first since you know divination,\nthen calculate whether you'll get hurt\nlater. As he spoke, Wayi Wu flicked his\nwrist and the M1911\ninstantly appeared in his palm. Without\nsaying a word, Wayi Wu immediately\nraised his gun and aimed it at a wine\njar not far away. Bang! A crisp gunshot\nrang out and a bullet shattered the wine\njar in an instant. The slightly cloudy\nwine spilled from the jar and the aroma\nof the wine instantly filled the hall.\nHearing the commotion coming from the\nlobby, the inkeeper quickly ran out from\nthe kitchen. However, before he could\neven speak, Jean Hai, who was standing\nnext to Wei Wu, took out a silver ingot\nand threw it over. Go back and prepare\nfood and drinks. Don't come out unless I\ncall you. Upon hearing Jean Hai's words,\nthe shopkeeper picked up the silver\ncoins at his feet without saying a word\nand went back to the kitchen. At this\nmoment, Wayi Wu turned his arm and\npointed the gun directly at the\nblackroed monk's forehead. Let's\ncalculate it, even if he might get\ninjured next. The blackroed monk glanced\nat the broken wine jar, then turned his\nhead and stared intently at the muzzle\nof the gun. After a long silence, he\nslowly spoke. This humble monk has only\na slight understanding of divination\ntechniques, and moreover, he can heal\nhimself, but not others. It is difficult\nfor him to calculate others divination.\nSo you have put this humble monk in a\ndifficult position. Yeah. He smiled and\nsaid something. Then we wu casually\nplaced the pistol directly on the table.\nThen with his eyes fixed on the\nblackroed monk, he continued, \"Well\nthen, you just said that I have an\nextraordinary background and future\nachievements. So tell me how I am\nextraordinary. You won't be shortchanged\non your reward.\" To be honest, at this\nmoment, the blackroed monk was filled\nwith doubt. Based on his understanding\nof Wei Woo, Weii Wu was not at all such\na capricious person. Even if my behavior\njust now was somewhat rude, it shouldn't\nwarrant such hostility towards me.\nMoreover, he didn't know if it was just\nhis imagination, but he always felt that\nway Woo seemed to value him very much.\nIt wasn't the kind of attention that\ncomes from appreciating talent, but\nrather the kind of attention that comes\nwith a degree of weariness. While\npondering this in his mind, the black\nrobeed monk did not forget to answer Wei\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s question. The origins of this\nnoble person are too mysterious, as if\nshrouded in a fog. It is only because\nthis humble monk's abilities are limited\nthat I cannot see clearly. But your\nfuture status and position will be so\nhigh that you could be second only to\none person and above 10,000 people or\neven above 10 million people. As soon as\nthe black robed monk finished speaking,\nhe noticed that we woos gaze towards him\nhad changed. He may have been somewhat\nrelaxed just now, but now he exudes an\ninvisible aura of ferocity. Just as he\nwas wondering why this was the case, Wu\nspoke up. Actually, I know a little\nabout fortuneelling, so why don't I give\nyou a reading, Monk? Without waiting for\nthe black robe, Monk's reply, Wayi Wu\ncontinued speaking on his own. As I just\nsaid, you not only understand the art of\nphysioamy, but you also practice\nConfucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism,\ndrawing on the strengths of all three.\nBorn into a family of doctors and later\nstudying the theory of ein and yang. You\nwere knowledgeable about everything from\nthe various schools of thought to the\nthree religions and nine schools of\nthought. He became a monk but didn't\nbelieve in Buddhism. He understood\nstrategy and military affairs but didn't\npursue an official career. He didn't\nseek fame or fortune and didn't love\nmoney. It's really strange. With each\nword we wu uttered, the blackroed monk's\nexpression grew more solemn. After Weii\nWu finished speaking, the blackroed monk\nlooked at him with the same shock as if\nhe had seen a ghost. He, who had never\nbelieved in ghosts and gods, actually\nwavered a little at this moment. Having\nlived through a chaotic era, almost no\none in the world knew his origins. Yet\nnow, Wei Wu recounted them in detail as\nif they were his own treasures. My\npreviously calm and undisturbed state of\nmind was shattered by these few words.\nHowever, Wayiwood didn't even glance at\nhim despite his shock. He just pretended\nto pinch his fingers and then randomly\ntapped his knuckles a few times. Then,\nas if he had figured something out, a\nlook of sudden realization appeared on\nhis face. I see. You are knowledgeable\nand proficient in various schools of\nthought, but at the same time, you are\narrogant and disdainful of showing\nanything to the world because you think\nthey don't deserve it. You just want an\nopportunity to see if what you've\nlearned in your life is useful. But now\nthat the world is at peace, there are no\nsuitable conditions for you to use your\nskills. Because your greatest skill is\nthe art of slaying dragons. At this\npoint, Wayi Wiu looked at the black\nrobed monk with a playful expression and\nsaid in a flippant tone, \"Am I right,\nDian Monk? Yao Guang Xiao, or should I\ncall Yaoini?\" Yao Guang Xiao, who was\nalready terrified, heard Wayi Wu call\nout his real name. A storm raged within\nhim, and his body began to tremble\nuncontrollably. At this moment, Yao\nGuang Xiao used all his life's\ncultivation of composure to barely\nsuppress the surging emotions in his\nheart. After a long silence, Weii Wu\nfinally spoke and asked in a deep voice,\n\"Lord Chonglu, may I ask you, who are\nyou and why do you know so much about\nme?\" Chapter 189. You ordered it but\ndidn't eat it. Are you being\ndisrespectful? Yao Guan Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s\nquestion made Weii Wu burst into\nlaughter. He came out this time just to\nplay the charlatan. He was originally\nthinking of finding an opportunity to\npractice his skills first. Unexpectedly,\nbefore he even started looking, the\nopportunity came knocking on his door.\nYou must know that the person in front\nof you is none other than the peerless\ndemon monk Yao Guang Xiao. If even\nsomeone like him could be fooled, then\nthe followers of the White Lotus sect\nare even less likely to be fooled. While\nsecretly laughing to himself, Wayi Wu\nlooked at Yao Guang Xiao again. But this\nguy is really something. Even though\nhe's not the kind of old man in his 50s\nor 60s who has seen it all. Even with\nall his secrets exposed, he can still\nremain so calm. His composure is truly\nremarkable. For this reason alone, we wu\ncould give him a thumbs up in his heart.\nBut that was all. When Yao Guang Xiao\nasked him, he simply replied with two\nwords. You guess. Hearing Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s\nclearly teasing tone, Yao Guang Xiao\nlowered his head and remained silent.\nAfter a long silence, he looked at Wayi\nWu again and asked, \"So, Lord Chong, Lud\nalready anticipated that this humble\nmonk would come looking for you and\ndeliberately stayed here to wait for me\nto show myself. Calculate? I don't\nunderstand. Chimna, Bwa, Ingyong,\ndivination, or anything like that. So,\nhow could I possibly calculate it?\nDidn't you say all of this yourself?\" As\nwe wu chuckled to himself, he couldn't\nhelp but mutter a curse in his heart.\nHowever, he didn't show it on his face\nand maintained a smiling expression the\nwhole time. At the same time, he did not\nanswer Yao Guang Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s questions,\nhoping to glean more useful information.\nHowever, Yao Guang Xiao was also quite\ncautious. Seeing that Wayi Wu remained\nsilent, he also kept quiet and said no\nmore. Seeing this, we wu simply\nabandoned his previous idea and spoke\ndirectly. Actually, I'm very curious.\nWhy didn't you stay by the Prince of Yan\nside? Why did you choose to leave the\ncapital and come and find me? They can't\nbe planning to give me a white hat, too.\nI we woo. I'm just a mere Earl. I don't\nhave that kind of brain. Even if he is\nrelated to his majesty in some way, he\nis not like the prince of Yan, who is\nhis majesty's own son and a prince of\nthe Ming dynasty, so giving me that\ntitle is useless. Upon hearing Wei\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s words, Yao Guang Xiao\nimmediately clenched his fist onto the\ntable. However, he wasn't about to take\naction. He was simply trying his best to\nhide his emotions. That's right. He\nbroke through and Wei Wu broke through\nhis defenses once again. The first time\nWei Wu revealed his background. The\nsecond time, Wayi Wu pointed out his\nabilities and skills. And now this time,\nthis was the third time he had broken\ndown since he met Wei Wu. He had just\ntold Prince Yinhu Di that he would give\nhim a white hat. Zhu D was a king. But\nwhen a white hat was given to him, the\nking became an emperor. But when this\nwas mentioned, Yao Guang Xiao was\nabsolutely certain that there was no one\nelse around. How did Wayi Wu lur about\nthis? He himself never said it. And\nsince it involved a serious crime of\nrebellion, Zhu would not have told\noutsiders about it. Could it be that we\nwoo really is a fortune teller able to\npredict the past thousand years and the\nfuture 500 years? Although he was\nextremely surprised, Yao Guang Xiao kept\nhis expression perfectly under control.\nThe Earl of Chonglu is indeed incredibly\npowerful. He can even tell me when I met\nthe Prince of Yan and what I said to\nhim. That's right. This humble monk is\nindeed grateful for his highness Prince\nYan's appreciation and hospitality and\nis prepared to personally sew a white\nfox fur hat as a gift. After all, the\nclimate in Baying, the thief of the\nprince of Yen, is bitterly cold. And\nthis hat is a token of my humble monk's\nappreciation. No wonder Yao Guang Xiao\nwas able to cause so much trouble and\nleave such a great name in history. Even\nafter Wayi Wu pointed out his actions,\nthis guy could still make up stories\nwith a straight face. To be fair, what\nhe made up was quite reasonable. The\nclimate in the FFTDom where Zhu D was in\ntheft was indeed cold. Giving a white\nfox fur hat as a gift is perfectly\nnormal. If it was someone else in this\nsituation, they might continue their\nwitty banter with Yao Guang Xiao.\nHowever, Wayi Wu was well aware that he\nwas only able to catch his opponent offg\nguard by relying on his understanding of\nhistory. If the conversation continues,\ngiven this wicked monk's intelligence,\nhe'll probably start to figure things\nout. Therefore, you can't play by the\nrules at this time. As the saying goes,\na novice can defeat a master. So after\nYao Guang Xiao finished speaking, Weii\nWu simply reached out and slowly swept\nhis hand across the table. The M1911\nthat he had placed on the table was\nimmediately stored in the system\nwarehouse. Upon seeing this, Yao Guang\nXiao&lt;unk&gt;s pupils contracted sharply. He\nbecame a monk at the age of 14 and\nafterwards traveled the world, making\nfriends with people from all walks of\nlife. No one knows the tricks of the\ntrade better than him. However, he\ncouldn't see any flaws in Weii Wu&lt;unk&gt;s\nmove, even though the hand movement was\nso slow. And without any cover, that\nstrange weapon simply vanished, just\nlike a spell. Although he knew that Weii\nWu was deliberately trying to put him in\na bad light, he was still taken aback by\nthis move. Just as Yao Guang Xiao was in\nshock, we wu&lt;unk&gt;s slightly cold voice\nrang in his ears again. Yao Guang Xiao,\nI don't care if you want to prove your\ntalent. The world is vast, and there are\nplenty of places where you can showcase\nyour abilities. But I must remind you,\nthis dragon slaying technique is best\nleft untouched by the Ming Dynasty. With\nme in the Ming Dynasty, you won't be\nable to slay it, even if you want to. At\nthis point, Wayi Wu twitched his fingers\na few more times before continuing. Your\nlifespan is 84 years, and you're already\n47 years old. You have more than 30\nyears left, so just live your life\nhonestly. If you ignore my advice and\ninsist on defying fate, then I can\nguarantee that your lifespan will end\nprematurely. As Wayi Wu was speaking,\nthe restaurant staff brought over the\nwine and dishes. Upon seeing this, Yao\nGuang Xiao slowly stood up, clased his\nhands together, and bowed to Wei Wu. I\nwill certainly keep Chong Lebo&lt;unk&gt;s\nadvice in mind. In that case, I will\ntake my leave now. After hearing Yao\nGuang Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s words, we wu&lt;unk&gt;s lips\ncurved into a slight smile. This wicked\nmonk was just referring to himself as\nthis humble monk. But now he only dares\nto call himself this lowly monk. What a\nchange. Just as Weii Wu was secretly\nlaughing. Yao Guang Xiao was also\npreparing to turn around and leave.\nHowever, before he could take a step, we\nwu spoke again. You came to me begging\nfor arms. And now that the food and wine\nare served, you're not eating the food I\nordered. Are you not giving me face? Yao\nGuang Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s body stiffened\nimmediately after taking his first step.\nKnowing that Weii Wu was trying to\nintimidate him, he had no choice but to\nbite the bullet and turned back to sit\ndown. The two didn't say a word during\nthe meal, and the silence was somewhat\neerie. Weiiui did not speak again until\nhe had finished eating everything on the\ntable. Now that we've eaten and drunk\nour fill, I won't keep you any longer,\nMaster. It's getting late, so please be\nvery careful walking at night, Master Da\nYian. After saying that, Wayi Wu got up\nand walked towards his room without even\nglancing at Yao Guang Xiao. Yao Guang\nXiao waited until Wei Wu and his men had\nall returned to their rooms before\nslowly standing up. No wonder the prince\nof Yan was so wary of him and didn't\neven dare to have any ideas about him.\nThe Earl of Chonglu is a tough hurdle to\novercome. As he pondered, Yao Guang Xiao\nraised his head with a complex\nexpression, staring at the spot where\nWei Wu had last disappeared. But soon\nhis eyes hardened again, and he turned\nand left the inn, disappearing into the\nnight. Chapter 190 arrival at Huian\nTower in Yanjo, the strange waiter. Just\nas Yao Guang Xiao was leaving, Jean Hai\nalso arrived at Wayi Wu&lt;unk&gt;s room.\nYoung master, should I go with that\nmonk? As he spoke, Jean Hai raised his\nhand and made a cutting motion below his\nneck. Seeing him like this for a moment,\nWeii Wu felt as if he had become a\nvillain. So, he quickly shook his head,\nclearing his mind of these inexplicable\nthoughts before speaking. \"No need. I\ndidn't mean to kill him when I said\nthat. He's not someone you could just\ntake down easily. He's incredibly\nskilled. Besides, even if you take\npeople out to chase after him now, you\nwon't be able to find his trail. He\nwouldn't dare to come looking for me if\nhe didn't have that much ability. That\nbeing said, Wayi Wu still held a certain\ndegree of appreciation for talent.\nOtherwise, he could have just shot Yao\nGuang Xiao dead. He was just a monk. No\none would have dared to criticize him if\nhe had been killed. It would be a shame\nto kill him. So, I'm giving him a\nchance. At the same time, it can be\nconsidered that one has made\narrangements and two preparations. Now\nthat Zhu Yuan Jang has decided to\nestablish thieftdoms overseas, even if\nthe princes have ulterior motives, they\nwill not have the ability to do so in\nthe future. Even if Yao Guang Xiao\npossessed the skill to slay dragons, it\nwould be difficult for him to find\nsomeone worthy of his assistance.\nMoreover, the future Ming dynasty is\ndestined to dominate the world off\nforeign lands, and its national strength\nwill far surpass that of any previous\ndynasty in China. At that time, the only\nway for Yao Guang Xiao to fully utilize\nhis talents would be to serve the Ming\ndynasty. Of course, if this guy remains\nstubborn and tries to stir up trouble to\nprove his talent, that's one thing. Then\nwe could take advantage of him to lure\nout all the rats in the sewers and catch\nthem all in one fell swoop. Anyway, as\nlong as Zu is still around, nothing big\ncan happen in this world. Even if Zhu\nYuan Jang passes away in the future,\nCrown Prince Xuao will still be around.\nWith him around, the Ming dynasty will\nnot fall into chaos. To put it bluntly,\nWeii Wu&lt;unk&gt;s last comment about walking\nat night was actually a dig at Yao Guang\nXiao. You can leave. I won't stop you.\nBut you should know one thing. You have\nto be extremely careful when walking at\nnight. Otherwise, if you walk in the\ndark too often, you might encounter\nghosts and then you might lose your\nlife. In fact, Yao Guang Xiao understood\nWeii Wu&lt;unk&gt;s meaning, which is why he\nsaid that Wayi Wu was a difficult\nhurdle. As for the final choice, that's\nup to Yao Guang Xiao himself. After the\nunexpected incident with Yao Guang Xiaoi\nWu continued his journey the next day.\nNothing unexpected happened after that.\nAfter 2 days of travel, they finally\narrived in Yong Joe. It's no wonder that\nso many poets mention Yong Joe in their\npoems. The place is indeed prosperous.\nThis ancient city known as the famous\ncapital of Huha River Basin and the\nbeautiful place of Zhushi not only has a\nprofound historical heritage. Moreover,\nit is a place where literati and\nscholars love to travel and gather,\ndelicious hayong cuisine, exquisitely\nlaid out and uniquely styled gardens and\nthe delicate charm of the Jang and water\ntowns. All of these factors combined\ntogether create Yong Joe, an ancient\ncity that captivates people without them\neven realizing it. After entering the\ncity, the carriage passed through the\nbustling market and slowly moved along\nthe Blueest Road. Before long, the\ncarriage stopped in front of the largest\nrestaurant in Yona. Above the main\nentrance of a restaurant hangs a plaque\nwith the three large characters Huinlu\nengraved on it. The handwriting alone\ntells you that these three characters\nmust have been written by a famous\ncalligrapher. After lifting the curtain\nof the sedan chair and getting out of\nthe carriage, Wayi Wu glanced at the\nrestaurant in front of him and couldn't\nhelp but sigh. Shunlin certainly knows\nhow to enjoy life. Even in the capital,\nthis restaurant is one of the most\nluxurious. As they were talking, a young\nman dressed as a waiter came running up\nto him from inside the restaurant.\nPlease come in, esteemed guests. Then\nled by the waiter, Weii Wu and his group\narrived at a private room on the second\nfloor of Huanlu. What would you like to\norder, gentlemen? Weii Wu waved his hand\nand said, \"Don't rush to order food. Let\nme ask you something first.\" \"All right,\nsir, please ask. I'll answer to the best\nof my knowledge.\" Upon hearing this, Wu\nchuckled and casually tossed some loose\nsilver to the waiter. He then took out a\nfive-tail silver ingot and placed it on\nthe table before asking. I enjoy hearing\ninteresting stories. Has anything\ninteresting happened to your store\nrecently? The waiter tilted his head and\nthought for a moment before speaking.\nNo, that's not true. The people who come\nto our Hugh and Lou are either wealthy\nmerchants or gentry. They're all here to\ntalk business and do deals. After\nhearing the waiter reply, Wayi Wu\ncouldn't help but feel a little\ndisappointed. Oh, I see. Okay, then\nlet's order. What are some of your\nspecialty dishes? You've come to the\nright person. Our HA restaurant is most\nfamous for its soft shelled eel and the\nthree delicacies of the river, which are\nabsolutely delicious. Okay, let's\narrange that. Also, bring some local\nspecialties. All right, please wait a\nmoment, sir. The waiter raised his voice\nand immediately turned and left the\nprivate room, heading towards the\ncounter on the first floor. At the same\ntime, as the waiter left, a glint of\nlight flashed in Wayi Wu&lt;unk&gt;s eyes.\nThis waiter is really honest. My\nhard-earned money is right in front of\nme, and he can't even come up with a\nstory. As he spoke, Wayi Wu turned to\nlook at Jon Hai. Although he didn't say\nanything, the latter understood\nimmediately. Without saying a word, he\nleft the private room with one of his\nteammates. In fact, Wayi Wiu just found\nit strange that those people burned down\nSombai Tower in order to kill Lu Yao.\nBut nothing seemed to have happened at\nYinlu this time. So, I thought I'd try\nto find out from the waiter. However,\nthe waiter's answer made him feel that\nsomething was wrong. Logically speaking,\nif the waiter saw five tales of silver,\nhe would rack his brains to come up with\nsomething. Even if it's just making up a\nstory, the waiter should at least earn\nthose five tales of silver. But he\ndidn't. Instead of trying to get his\nhands on the five tales of silver, he\nseemed to be deliberately trying to\ncover up the truth. That's interesting.\nA mere waiter isn't the manager, so\nsurely he wouldn't be worried about\naffecting business. Five or six days\nhave passed since Shan Lin sent back the\nmessage, and Yanjo City is only so big.\nKimlu was a well-known restaurant in the\ncity, so it was impossible for those\npeople not to know that Lu Yao was here.\nknowing that Lu Yao was right there.\nThese people didn't make a move, which\nmakes it hard to say there wasn't\nsomething fishy going on. Actually, it's\nnot that way. Woo is overly sensitive.\nIt's just that when you're traveling,\nyou have to be careful about everything.\nAfter all, one only has one life, so he\nnever hesitates to assume the worst\nabout others. As it turned out, Chow\nChowo's caution was not without reason.\nAbout 10 minutes after Jean Hai left,\nthe waiter carried a plate of dishes\ninto the private room. Just as he was\nserving the dishes, Jean Hai happened to\nwalk in from outside. He first exchanged\na glance with Wei Wu, then looked at the\ndishes on the table and slowly shook his\nhead. The two did not exchange a single\nword, yet they had already completed the\nexchange of information. The waiter\ndidn't see the two exchanging glances.\nAfter placing the dishes, he bowed and\nsaid something. \"Please enjoy your meal,\nsir.\" After the waiter left the private\nroom, Jean Hai quickly walked to Wei\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s side and whispered, \"There was\nsomething poison in the food, but I\ncan't tell what kind of poison it is.\"\nWayi Wu nodded, glanced at the dishes on\nthe table, and then asked another\nquestion since I'm going to keep an eye\non that waiter. Also, where is Shan\nLinn? I've already sent my team to find\nthem. They should be here to see the\nyoung master soon. Chapter 19, First\nMeeting with Lu Yao. 500,000 tales of\nsilver for a life. After answering Weii\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s question, Jean Hai immediately\ngave a wink to the teammate next to him.\nWithout saying a word, the latter turned\naround and walked out of the private\nroom. Not long after, a series of\nhurried footsteps could be heard outside\nthe private room. Shunlin walked in with\nhis seven teammates and a young man he\ndidn't recognize. After entering,\nShunlin quickly walked up to Wei Wu.\nYoung master Shanlin is incompetent,\nwhich is why you have to make this trip\nin person. Weii Wu smiled slightly,\npatted Shunllin on the shoulder, and\nsaid, \"It's all right. I was leaving the\ncapital anyway, so I just happened to\ncome along and bring you along to help\nme with some business.\" After saying\nthat, he turned to look at the young man\nnot far away. This person wasn't\nanything special. He was the kind of\nperson you'd easily lose in a crowd,\nvery ordinary. The feeling was somewhat\ndifferent from what Shinshin described,\nbut his attitude was neither humble nor\narrogant. Even when they saw me, they\ndidn't show any sign of being inferior.\nInstead, they stood tall and proud.\nSeeing this, Wei Wu pointed to the seat\nopposite him. \"Lu Yao, right? Sit down.\"\nAfter Lu Yao was seated, Wei Wu spoke\nagain. \"You said you would only tell me\nwhat you know if you saw me. Now you can\ntell me.\" Lu Yao, who had been observing\nWeii Wu, hesitated for a moment before\nasking after hearing this. I will\ncertainly tell you, but I would like to\nknow your true identity. What didn't\nShinllin and the others tell you? I\nasked, but no matter how I asked, they\nwouldn't reveal a single word. After\nanswering Wu&lt;unk&gt;s question, Lu Yao\nstared intently at Wayi Wu as if waiting\nfor his reply. Normally, we would need\nto introduce himself at this point.\nHowever, we did not play by the usual\nrules. If they won't say anything, then\nI won't either. On the contrary, you\nshould tell me everything you know. Upon\nhearing Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s reply, Lu Yao was\nstunned and remained speechless for a\nlong time. After a long while, he came\nto his senses and looked at Wayi Wu with\na strange expression. Seeing this, Weii\nWu spoke again. \"What? You only said you\nwanted to see me and tell me in person,\nbut you didn't say you needed to know my\nidentity before you told me. Or are you\nplaying me? At this point, Wayi Wu&lt;unk&gt;s\nvoice turned considerably colder.\nSensing the murderous intent in Wei\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s tone, Lu Yao immediately shook\nhis head. I am now just a prisoner. I\nhave neither the right nor the guts to\nplay tricks on you. Upon hearing this,\nWeii Wu&lt;unk&gt;s expression changed again,\nbecoming as warm and harmonious as a\nspring breeze. This unpredictable change\nin mood made Lu Yao feel uneasy, and he\ncouldn't help but frown. But before he\ncould think any further, he heard Wayi\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s voice again. Let's begin.\nFirst, tell me why you insisted on\nseeing me before you spoke. Because I\nwant to live. Upon hearing this answer,\nwe wu raised an eyebrow and looked at\nhim with suspicion. asking. It's that\nsimple. For me, it was as difficult as\nwalking on the edge of a cliff where I\ncould fall into the abyss at any moment\nand be smashed to pieces. After\nresponding again, Lua took a deep breath\nbefore speaking. Lu he was a wolf in\nsheep's clothing. He secretly colluded\nwith the Kong family in Sufu and even\nwent so far as to fabricate a smallox\ncase. Now that the matter has been\nexposed, the Imperial Court will\ncertainly not let go of anyone related\nto the Lou family, let alone me, an\nillegitimate child. The Kong family is\nhiding behind the scenes, plotting so\nmany things through the Lou family. In\norder not to be implicated, they will\nnot let me live. Good heavens, in order\nto severize and save his own life. Lua\ndidn't even call him father anymore and\ndirectly called him Lu E by his full\nname. He even used the phrase wolf's\nambition to describe his own father\ntruly a devoted and filial son. Weii Wu\ncomplained inwardly, but he also knew\nthat Lu Yaing's current situation was\nindeed as precarious as walking on thin\nice. Although he did not reveal his\nidentity, Shunlin and his entourage of\nimperial guards were undeniably\nrecognized. For Lu Yao, this meant that\nthe more distant the relationship\nbetween the Imperial Court and Lu E, the\nbetter. If nothing unexpected happens,\nLu Yao will probably start playing the\nvictim next. Sure enough, just as Wei Wu\nwas making this guess. Lu Yao spoke up\nagain. They burned down my pine and\nCypress Tower this time. If it weren't\nfor your man, I probably would have\nperished in the fire that night. I don't\nknow what I might do next. I'm already\nat my wit's end, and all I can do is try\nto survive. At this point, Lu Yao turned\nto look at Shan Lin and the others\nbefore continuing. I know they can't\nmake the decisions, so this is the only\nway I can force you to come here in\nperson as a sign of sincerity. I will\ntell you everything and then offer you\n200,000 tales of silver as a life-saving\nfee in exchange for your mercy.\" Weii Wu\nsmiled faintly, picked up the teacup on\nthe table, took a sip, and then casually\nplayed with it for a while. Then with a\nplayful glint in his eyes, he looked at\nLu Yao and said slowly and deliberately,\n\"200,000 tales. The Lu family has been\noperating in Jang for so many years. And\nthey also have the crown princess's\nsupport.\" Behind the scenes, they even\nsold grain to the White Lotus sect,\nsupplying it to the remnants of the Yuan\ndynasty, making a fortune from it. As\nthe last remaining heir of the Lu\nfamily, I find it hard to believe that\nLu he only left you this little bit of\nsilver. Lu Yao seemed to have been\nmentally prepared for this situation.\nAfter listening to Wayi Wu&lt;unk&gt;s words,\nhe remained very calm in both expression\nand tone. To avoid worrying about making\na living in the future, I do have some\nspare money left, about 50,000 tales. If\nyou think 200,000 is not enough, I will\nkeep only 1,000 tales for myself and\ngive the rest to you. How about that?\nAlthough A Wu did not value money, he\nwould not refuse to receive hundreds of\nthousands for free. However, the 200,000\nor so in front of them was clearly not\nenough, and Lu Yao definitely had more\nthan that amount of money. Seeing that\nway, Wu did not respond, Lu Yao also\nremained silent. However, as time slowly\npassed, the expression on his face began\nto show some anxiety. The atmosphere in\nthe private room became eerie and quiet.\nAnd finally, Lu Yao let out a helpless\nsigh. 500,000 tales is all the property\nthat Lu E left me. I am willing to give\nall of this money to you, sir. I only\nasked for a way to survive. I am just an\nillegitimate child hidden away to\ncontinue the family line. I will not be\ngiven much wealth. If you still don't\nbelieve me, then just kill me. In the\nend, I can't escape death anyway. After\nLu Yao finished speaking, Weii Wu, who\nhad remained silent until now, finally\nspoke. You should have behaved this way\nearlier. Your Lu family has committed\nthe heinous crime of exterminating nine\ngenerations of your clan. It would be\nvery risky to spare your life. As he\nspoke, Wayi Wu pointed directly to the\ndishes on the table and warmly greeted\nthem. Come, come, as I'm going to eat\nfirst. Don't worry. For the sake of\n500,000 tales, I promise, \"I'll spare\nyour life.\" Despite Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s\nenthusiastic attitude, he didn't even\npick up chopsticks himself. He simply\nlooked at Lu Yao with a warm expression\nand gesture for Jean Hai to bring Lu Yao\npair of chopsticks. I wanted to see if\nLu Yao would eat these dishes. Chapter\n192, Dark Clouds Loom. A difficult and\nunpredictable situation underway. Wu's\nwatchful gaze. Lu Yao took the\nchopsticks from Shanghai, picked up a\npiece of fish, and threw it into his\nmouth. While chewing, there was a hint\nof appreciation for the taste of the\ndish in his eyes, and there was\nabsolutely nothing wrong with it. Seeing\nthis, a glint of light flashed in Wei\nWoo's eyes. He didn't say anything, but\nhe secretly pondered what was going on.\nWhen exactly did I expose my\nwhereabouts, and how did these people\nrecognize me? Since discovering that the\nwaiter was acting strangely and that the\ndishes had been drugged, Weii Wu\nsuspected that Yanlu was a setup. He was\nunsure whether this was a setup by Lu\nYao or someone else using this meeting\nas an opportunity. They set up a trap\njust waiting for you to walk right into\nit. He had talked so much about what Lu\nYao had said, but it wasn't for the\nso-called 500,000 tales of silver. She\nwanted to hear his reasons for insisting\non meeting her before he would open up\nand tell her everything. However, it\nmust be admitted that Lu Yao's reasoning\nwas very reasonable, and so far he has\nnot seen any flaws in it. However, the\nabsence of flaws does not mean that Lu\nYao is without any problems. So, Chow\nChow deliberately made Lu Yao eat these\npoison dishes just to see if he would\nactually eat them. If Lu Yao refuses to\neat or makes any seemingly reasonable\nexcuse, it would be enough to prove that\nLu Yao is in the no. However, the result\nsurprised Wei Wu as Lu Yao ate it\nwithout any warning. Based on the\ncurrent situation, although it cannot be\ncompletely ruled out, it is highly\nlikely that Lu Yao has nothing to do\nwith drugging. However, this only makes\nthe matter more complicated and\nconfusing. Shinl and the others stayed\nat Huen Tower for five or 6 days without\nany problems. But as soon as he arrived,\nsomeone poisoned him. Isn't it obvious\nthat this is aimed at me? The question\nis why is this happening? After entering\nHughlu, he did not immediately contact\nShenllin and the others, but ordered\nfood like a normal customer. How did\nthose people behind the scenes manage to\nfind him so precisely? After thinking\nfor a long time, Wayi Wu could only come\nup with two possibilities. Either there\nwas a hidden mastermind behind it all\nwho knew his appearance. Or perhaps from\na moment he left Beijing, he had already\nbeen being watched. As for who the\nmastermind behind it all is, there's no\nneed to even guess. Thump. As we Woo was\npondering this, a heavy thud suddenly\ncame from the opposite side of the\ntable. Looking up, I saw that Lu Yao,\nwho had been eating, now had his entire\nhead buried in the food dish. Upon\nseeing this, Shunlin, who was standing\nnearby, immediately stepped forward to\ncheck. Young master, it's a sleeping\npotion. Upon hearing this result, Weii\nWoo was at a loss for words. It's\nanother sleeping pill. Last time it was\na sleeping potion, and this time it's a\nsleeping pill. Lu Yao really lives up\nhis name. He's got two doses of drugs.\nJust as Wei Wu was speechless, the team\nmember that Jean Hai had sent to capture\nthe waiter walked in from outside the\nprivate room. Young master, I am\nincompetent. I have searched for a long\ntime, but have not been able to find any\ntrace of that waiter. Upon hearing this,\nWayi Wu frowned and immediately asked,\n\"Have you asked the shopkeeper?\" I asked\nand the shopkeeper said that the waiter\nwas just hired a few days ago. I checked\nwith other people and it's true. They\nran away. You drugg him and ran away. So\ndecisive. Wait a minute. Something's not\nright. If this person didn't use poison,\nbut rather a sleeping potion, then there\nmust be some other trick up their\nsleeve. Upon realizing this possibility,\nWayi Wu immediately stood up, cautiously\nassessing his surroundings. However, as\nif to confirm his guess, as Wei Wu stood\nup, the sound of hurried footsteps\ncoming up the stairs came from the\ndirection of the stairs. Hearing the\ncommotion outside, before Wei Wu could\neven speak, Shun Lin and the others\nquickly went on alert, protecting Wei Wu\nin the middle. Just as Shinlin and his\nmen were on high alert, a group of\nconstables wielding steel knives came up\nthe stairs. A quick count revealed there\nwere about 30 people who had already\ncompletely surrounded the private room.\nUpon seeing the Yammen runners uniforms\non their bodies, Shunlin quickly took\nout the embroidered uniform guard token\nfrom his pocket. We are the embroidered\nuniform guard. Get your squad leader out\nhere and talk to me. Under normal\ncircumstances, the identity of the\nembroidered uniform guard would be\nsufficient to intimidate local\ngovernment officials and soldiers. Even\nif they had any doubts, the constables\nwould first put away their blades. Then\nthey would ask their own squad leader to\nconfirm Shinllin and his group's\nidentities, whether they were indeed\nguard. But these constables were\nstrange. They not only didn't she their\nswords, but they also ignored Shenllin\ncompletely. It was as if they didn't\ncare at all about offending the Imperial\nGuard, the Emperor's personal army. Just\nas Shinlin and the others were\nwondering, a voice suddenly came from\namong the Yammen runners. Kill. As soon\nas the shout of killing rang out, the\nconstables rushed over without\nhesitation, brandishing their knives.\nSeeing this, Shunlin and the others no\nlonger hesitated and directly took the\nrifles hanging behind them into their\nhands. Bang! Bang! Bang! Several\ngunshots rang out in succession, and the\nconstables who were hit by the bullets\nfell to the ground and died on the spot.\nHowever, the other constables acted as\nif they hadn't seen anything, as if they\ndidn't care about their companions life\nor death at all. He stubbornly stepped\nover the corpses of his comrades and\ncontinued charging towards Weii Wu. Weii\nWu watched this scene with a furrowed\nbrow, a strange sense of familiarity\ncreeping into his heart, but he couldn't\nquite put his finger on what felt\nfamiliar. The gunfire continued under\nthe suppressive fire of Shinllin and his\nmen. Any constables who came within 10 m\nwere killed on the spot. In just over 10\nseconds, only a dozen or so constables\nremained standing on the other side.\nBoth way Woo and Shinllin believed that\nthese people were too afraid of being\nkilled to dare to cross the line again.\nJust as they were thinking this, the\ndozen or so constables took something\nout of their pockets and put in their\nmouths. Then their expressions changed,\nbecoming somewhat manic, and their eyes\nrevealed a kind of fanaticism. Shortly\nafterward, these people went berserk and\ntore their clothes open, exposing their\nchest to the air. Seeing this, Shun Linn\nand the others felt bewildered. But way\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s eyes suddenly narrowed. He\nfinally understood why he felt a sense\nof familiarity when he saw these people.\nThis fanaticism and fearlessness are\nexactly like Wong Gang who was fooled\nand crippled. Although they did not\nchant any incantations. Weii Wu was\ncertain that these people were followers\nof the White Lotus sect. What Way\ncouldn't understand was why the White\nLotus sect members were here. Could it\nbe that the mastermind behind the\nburning of Songbi Tower and the drugging\nincident was not the Kong family, but\nthe White Lotus sect? But the question\nis, why would the White Lotus sect want\nto kill Lu Yao? It doesn't make sense.\nAnd these White Lotus followers in front\nof us are all so strange. You can tell\nthey're chanting something. It's likely\nto be a spell related to the Eternal\nMother or the Vacuum Homeland. However,\nthey were chanting silently without\nmaking a sound, which was not something\na member of the White Lotus sect would\ndo. To be honest, the appearance of\nthese White Lotus sect members really\nconfused Wei Woos thinking, he racked\nhis brains, but couldn't find a thread\nor figure out the details of this\ntangled mess. Just as Wei Woo was\nfrowning in deep thought, the Constables\nrushed over like madmen. Chapter 193.\nThe Kong family causes trouble and the\nWhite Lotus sect joins the fry. Bang!\nBang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Faced with\nthe onslaught of these thugs, Shan Lllin\nand his men pulled the triggers without\neven waiting for Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s orders.\nAmidst the increasingly intense gunfire,\nbullets poured rapidly from muzzles. A\nmere dozen or so flesh and blood bodies\nwere shot to death in less than two\nseconds, all falling into pools of\nblood. Awakened by the gunfire, Weii Wu\nglanced at the corpses and blood stains\non the ground and immediately made\narrangements. Keep an eye on Lu Yao.\nWe'll stay at Huian Tower. Jean Hai,\ntake two men to the YongJo Perfectual\nGovernment Office. These constables are\nsuspicious. Use your identity as a\nto investigate them and find out who\nsent them. Wayi Wu originally did not\nintend to contact local officials since\nhe had his own mission on this trip.\nIt's best to keep a low profile if\npossible, but there's no need for that\nanymore. If Yao Guang Xiao could find\nhim, the Kong family must be keeping an\neye on him, too. And even the White\nLotus sect would come knocking on his\ndoor. His whereabouts are as conspicuous\nas being placed under a light bulb. So,\nwhat's with the talk of keeping a low\nprofile? Moreover, having killed so many\npeople at Hu Yian Tower, even if he\ndidn't seek out those officials, they\nwould still come looking for him. At the\nsame time, what happened today really\ndisrupted his thoughts, leaving him\nmomentarily confused. To find out the\ntruth, we have to peel back the layers\none by one, starting with understanding\nthe situation of these Yammen runners.\nJudging from the behavior of these\npeople just now, they're definitely\nfollowers of the White Lotus sect.\nStrangely, none of the Yammen runners\nuniforms worn by these people were\nill-fitting. In other words, their\nclothes were not stolen, and they may\neven have been government officials\nthemselves. If that's true, then the\nperson who sent them is crucial. Upon\nhearing Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s instructions, Jean\nHai nodded without a word, turned\naround, and led his men away from Huian\nTower. Shunlin, along with the remaining\nmembers of the impermanent squad,\ncarefully protected Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s safety.\nAt the same time, about 100 meters\ndiagonally opposite Huian Tower, there\nis a tea house called Xi Shiao. An old\nman and a young man were sitting in a\ntea house on the second floor facing the\nstreet. The older one isn't actually\nthat old. He's just relatively older\ncompared to the younger one. He had a\nlong beard and wore a hair crown on his\nhead. He was a middle-aged man around 40\nyears old. The younger one had rosy lips\nand white teeth, and his eyes revealed a\nmaturity and sophistication beyond his\nyears. If Wayiu were here, he would\ndefinitely recognize him. The younger of\nthe two was the waiter who had served\nhim earlier. However, now his clothes\nand the demeanor he exudes are\ncompletely different from those of the\nwaiter. If you weren't staring at him\nclosely, you probably wouldn't think it\nwas the same person. The old man and the\nyoung man sat quietly in the tea room,\nneither speaking nor drinking tea. But\ntheir eyes remained fixed on the\ndirection of Hui Yian Tower. Only after\nJeang Hai and his team emerged from the\nmain gate of Huian Yian Tower did a\nyounger man remark with some emotion.\nThis marquee of Chong Lu Wei Wu is\nreally formidable. No wonder even that\nsimpleton Wong gang couldn't defeat him.\nHe certainly has some skill. After\nmuttering a sigh, the young man turned\nto look at the middle-aged man opposite\nhim. Master Jehong, let's get out of the\ncity. You've already been exposed. If\nyou don't leave now, you might not be\nable to leave later. Your majesty, if I\nleave, what will happen to you? It's all\nright. Don't worry about me. You can go\nout of the city first, and I'll come out\nof the city to meet you later.\" After\nsaying that, the young man turned his\nhead again to look at the Huian Tower\nnot far away. I'm very curious whether\nthis marquee of Changangle has the\nability to break the deadly trap that I\nand the Kong family have set for him.\nHearing what the young man said, Master\nJang said nothing more, he stood up,\nmade a strange gesture to him, and then\nturned and left the tea house without\nany hesitation. After Master Jang left,\nthe young man picked up his teacup and\nsavored it carefully. Not long after, he\nalso got up and left. Hi Tower. Lu Yao,\nwho was sleeping soundly thanks to the\nsleeping potion, was suddenly dowsted\nwith a bucket of cold water. In fact,\nWeiui did not want to be so\nstraightforward and brutal, but he\ndidn't know what kind of drug Lu Yao had\nbeen under. I've tried licorice and\nginger water, but they didn't work at\nall. This is the only way I can try.\nHowever, it must be said that the crude\nmethod actually has some good results.\nAfter a bucket of cold water was poured\nover him, the unconscious Lu Yao\nsuddenly jolted awake and instantly\nregained consciousness. At first, Lu Yao\nwas a little flustered, and his gaze\ntowards Weii Wu was complicated, clearly\nindicating that he had misunderstood\nsomething. It wasn't until he saw the\ncorpses of the constables around him\nthat he realized what had happened. \"My\nlord, may I ask what happened to me just\nnow?\" Weiiwi didn't explain much, but\nsimply pointed to the dishes on the\ntable that had been messed up. Here,\ntake another bite, and you'll see. Upon\nhearing Weii Wu&lt;unk&gt;s words, Lu Yao\nimmediately let out a long sigh. It's\nimpossible to guard against. All right,\nenough nonsense. Tell me everything you\nknow about the Kong family. Seeing that\nwe Wu&lt;unk&gt;s tone was not good, Lu Yao\ndid not dare to hesitate and told him\neverything he knew. Weiwood didn't\ninterrupt at all, but simply compared\nthe information with what he already\nknew in his mind. As it turns out, his\nand Zu Bao's previous guesses were\nmostly correct. Some details were\nunknown, but Lu Yao has now filled in\nthe gaps. For example, when Lu went on a\nlong trip, he did indeed contact the\nKong family, and the tunnel in the house\nwas the place of communication. His\nsubsequent actions, besides reflecting\nhis own ambition, were also largely due\nto the advice and strategies offered by\nthe Kong family. Lui himself did not\nknow why the Kong family sought out the\nLouu family and naturally did not tell\nLu Yao. However, on this issue, Weii Wu\nstill firmly believed in his guests,\nwhich was because of Crown Princess Lu.\nThe Kong family wanted to install an\nemperor who wouldn't target them, all\nfor their own benefit. In addition, Lu\nEie did indeed have some connections\nwith the White Lotus sect. However, it\nwasn't about supporting the White Lotus\nRebellion. It was simply a matter of\nsupply and demand, driven by the desire\nto make money without any deep\nentanglement. These are all things that\nLu E told Lu Yao personally so that he\ncould understand these things and be\nprepared for the future. To be honest,\nLu Yao didn't know much. We would\nalready guessed most of it. The\nexistence of Lu Yao primarily confirmed\nWeii Woos conjectures, turning\nspeculation into fact. Next, all we need\nto do is get the 500,000 tales of silver\nthat Lu Yao promised. Then find out who\nsent those Yammen runners and whether\nyou can find clues to track down the\npeople behind them. If we can find any\nclues, we'll take the money first, then\nkill Lu Yao and finally continue\ninvestigating along the clues. Find the\nbastard behind this and send him to Lan\nYu to ride the wooden donkey. If no\nclues are found, then collect the money.\nKill Lu Yao. Leave Yong Joe and continue\non to wrench him. That's right. Lu Yao\nis doomed to die no matter what because\nthere's no point in keeping him alive.\nHis greatest value lies in proving what\nthe Confucious family did. However, a\nsingle witness was not enough to bring\ndown the Kong family. And scholars\nthroughout the land would not believe\nwhat Lu Yao said. Weii Wu&lt;unk&gt;s plan was\nthe simplest and most direct. It didn't\nneed to prove anything. It just needed\nto bury them completely. However, just\nas Wei Wu was about to ask for money, a\ndesperate cry for justice came from\noutside. My lord, my lord, please see\nthe truth. I I am innocent. Chapter 194.\nMoney doesn't matter. I'm only\ninterested in the White Lotus sect.\nAlthough he had already guessed who the\nvisitor was, Wayi Wu couldn't help but\nfeel a sense of Ganka gone three Kai 3,\na complex emotion encompassing both\nemotion and feeling. No wonder he was\nable to rise to the position of prefect\nof Yong Joe. His voice could be heard\nbefore he was seen and he started\nshouting that he was wrong from afar.\nJust as Wei Wu was complaining, a\nmiddle-aged man dressed in Ming Dynasty\nofficial robes ran up to him anxiously.\nThey didn't even have time to catch\ntheir breath. They started explaining as\nsoon as they met. My lord, as the\nprefect of Yong Joe, I have always been\nconscientious and diligent, never daring\nto be negligent in the slightest. This\nhumble official does not know how these\nvillains managed to infiltrate the\ngovernment office. But I swear to God\nthat I did not instigate this. Your\nexcellency is wise and discerning. You\nwill surely be able to clear my name.\nGood heavens. Wayi Wu truly admires this\nYongJo prefect before him. He boasts\nabout being beautiful, swears to God,\nshirts responsibility, and doesn't\nforget to flatter at the end. This whole\nprocess was so smooth and seamless that\nWayi Wu was held in his composure for\nover a minute before he came to his\nsenses. However, after regaining his\nsenses, Wayi Wu didn't even glance at\nhim, but instead looked at Jean Hai\nbehind him. Only after Jean Hai nodded\nin confirmation that the prefect was\nindeed not involved in the matter did Wu\nspeak. All right, I don't want to hear\nany more nonsense. Tell me, who sent\nthese people? Seeing that way Wu wasn't\nbuying it, the prefect of Yang Joe was\nsecretly anxious and could only bite the\nbullet and reply, \"Yes, it was my\nadviser,\" he ordered the servants in the\nmanner to be dispatched. \"My lord, this\nmatter really has nothing to do with\nme.\" Master Jang was merely hired from\nthe common people by me to help with\ndaily affairs. I never imagined that he\nwould be such a vicious person. It is\nall my fault for misjudging people and\nbeing harmed by a villain. I beg you,\nsir, to give me a chance to make amends\nand bring this wicked man to justice.\nWaywood didn't bother listening to a\nsingle word the prefect said. It was all\nnonsense. However, one thing is certain.\nApart from their own trusted confidants,\nthe positions of advisers were basically\nfilled by hiring people from the general\npublic. The adviser was not an official.\nThe imperial court did not provide him\nwith any salary. Officials hired him\nprivately, paying out of their own\npockets. The prefect of YonJo in front\nof me is clearly a useless and\nincompetent person. In order to have\nmore time to enjoy himself, he would\ninevitably spend money to hire a\nsecretary to handle the miscellaneous\naffairs of the government office. This\ngave Master Jang, a member of the White\nLotus sect, the opportunity to\ninfiltrate the perpetual government and\nbecome the most powerful person besides\nthe prefect. Jang, the clerk, handled\nmost of the affairs in the government\noffice, making it incredibly easy to\narrange for members of the White Lotus\nsect to enter the office. Given the\ncurrent situation, Master Jang must have\nalready fled and there's no way we can\ncatch him now. Continuing to argue with\nthe Yanjo Prefect would only be a waste\nof time. So Wayi Wu simply spoke up. All\nright, I'll give you a chance. Arrest\nMaster Jeang within 10 days. But there's\nsomething I need to tell you beforehand.\nThese constables are all traitors of the\nWhite Lotus sect. If you fail to arrest\nthem within 10 days, you shall submit a\nmemorial to his majesty to plead guilty.\nUpon hearing Weii Wu&lt;unk&gt;s words, the\nprefect of Yangjo turned pale with\nfright. If it were just a villain who\ninfiltrated the government office, he\nwould at most be accused of misjudging\npeople. And at worst, he would be\ndemoted, but his life would not be in\ndanger. But once you get involved with\nrebels like the White Lotus sect, it's\nnot just a matter of being demoted. At\nthe very least, you'll be exiled or even\nlose your life. At that moment, the\nprefect of Yon Joe felt as if the sky\nwas falling and his face showed the\ngrief of losing his parents. How could\nthis happen? How could this happen? You\nbastard Jung. I've treated you well.\nYet, you betray me like this. The\nprefect of Yang Joe was truly terrified.\nOtherwise, he wouldn't have said in\nfront of Wei Wu that he had treated\nMaster Jang well. However, Weii Wu was\ntoo lazy to pursue the matter and\ndismissed the man without even glancing\nat him. After the Yanjo prefect left, we\nwu turned to Lu Yao and asked for money\nwithout any attempt to hide it. Give me\n500,000 tales. Once you have the money,\nI can guarantee that the court will not\narrest any more so-called remnants of\nthe Lu clan. When Lu Yao suddenly heard\nWayi Wu ask for money, he was caught off\nguard. However, he quickly regained his\ncomposure, hesitated for a moment after\nlooking at Wayi Wu&lt;unk&gt;s expression, and\nthen spoke. \"My lord, I will not go back\non my word since I've said so. But you\nalso know how dangerous my current\nsituation is. I was drugged and knocked\nout without even realizing it. So, I'm\nasking you to help me to the end,\nespecially regarding the Kong family.\"\nBefore Lu Yao could finish speaking,\nWayi Wu wave his hand to interrupt him.\nThat's none of my business. I'll take\n500,000 tales from you, which will only\nguarantee that the court will not pursue\nthis matter any further. The Kong family\nwon't listen to me. Even if I promise\nthem I won't cause you any trouble, do\nyou really believe it? In fact, the\n500,000 tales of silver were not\nessential for Wei Woo. Whether he could\nobtain them or not was irrelevant. The\nreason I spoke up was simply to try and\nsee if I could get any more useful\ninformation out of Lu Yao. Otherwise, he\ncould have simply agreed to Lu Yao's\ndemands, taken the money, and killed the\nman. There was no need for all this\ntrouble. On the other side, after\nlistening to Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s remarks, Lu\nYao&lt;unk&gt;s expression was extremely\nunpleasant. \"My lord, I only ask that\nyou send someone to escort me safely out\nof Yong Joe. Didn't you promise to give\nme a way out?\" Wayi Wu chuckled lightly,\nthen shrugged and said, \"That's right. I\nknow perfectly well that you're a\nremnant of the Lou family. Yet, I\nhaven't arrested you. Isn't that giving\nyou a way out? Otherwise, you wouldn't\nbe sitting here bargaining with me, but\nsquatting in a cell waiting to be\nexecuted in the autumn. As for the\n500,000 tales, you don't have to give it\nanyway. I can still get promoted and\nmake a fortune by handing you over, and\nthere's no risk involved. After hearing\nthese words, Lu Yao collapsed to the\nground as if he had lost his soul, his\nface full of struggle. Seeing this, we\nwouldn't say much and just sat down and\nwatched silently. He knew very well that\nLu Yao had no choice but to use the\nmoney to save his life. However, just as\nWei Wu was thinking this, Lu Yao\nsuddenly looked at the corpses of the\nYammen runners. He then stood up, took a\ndeep breath, and said, \"My lord, if I'm\nnot mistaken, these White Lotus Sack\nmembers have nothing to do with me.\nThey're here for you, aren't they?\" Upon\nhearing this, Wayi Wu raised an eyebrow\nbut did not deny it. He simply looked at\nLu Yao quietly because he knew very well\nthat Lu Yao would definitely have more\nto say. And that was indeed the case.\nSeeing that way, Wu did not respond. Lu\nYao continued, \"I know of a white lotus\nsex stronghold. If you, sir, were to\neliminate it, it would be a great\nachievement, and you would be promoted\nand enobled without a doubt. I would\nlike to use this message to exchange for\nyour sending someone to protect me and\nensure my safe departure from Yong Joe\nso that I don't have to worry about\nbeing persecuted by the Kong family. As\nsoon as Lu Yao finished speaking, Wayi\nWu immediately perked up. Originally, I\njust wanted to try and see if I could\nget anything out of Lu Yao, but I didn't\nexpect to have such a pleasant surprise.\nHe could do without the 500,000 tales of\nsilver, but he absolutely could not miss\nthe news about the White Lotus Sack\nstronghold. Looking at Lu Yao&lt;unk&gt;s\npleading face, Weii Wu slowly nodded. As\nlong as the base you provide is real,\nit's not impossible to send you out of\nYong Jojo safely. In an instant, Lu\nYao&lt;unk&gt;s energy and spirit finally\nrelaxed completely. Then, fearing that\nway Wu might change his mind, he\ncouldn't wait to speak. Thank you for\nyour great kindness, sir. I will take\nyou to get the silver as a token of my\nsincerity.\nChapter 195. Take the money first, then\ncheck the White Lotus sect stronghold.\nDoes Lu Yao really have information\nabout the White Lotus sect? Although Wu\nwas not 100% certain, the probability\nwas still quite high. After all, it's\nnormal for Lu E to know some information\nsince he had sold grain for the White\nLotus sect many times. However, it's\nbest to ask some questions beforehand.\nDon't worry about the money yet. Tell me\nthe location of the White Lotus Sack\nstronghold first. That's more important.\nAs soon as we Wu finished speaking, a\ntroubled expression appeared on Lu\nYao&lt;unk&gt;s face. Sir, why don't we take\nthe silver first and then I'll tell you\nafter we leave the city. What are you\nworried that after you tell me, I'll\nchange my mind and not see you off? Lu\nYao kept his head down and didn't reply,\nbut his attitude said it all. Seeing him\nlike this, Wayi Wu was furious. Where\nwas the trust between people? Is it\nreally that weak regarding this matter?\nWeii Wu could honestly say that he never\nintended to back out immediately after\nLu Yao brought it up. Although he would\ndefinitely have someone kill Lu Yao once\nthe information was verified, but we\nhaven't even started yet. Doesn't he\nrealize how much damage such a small act\nof distrust can cause? Lu Yao, the way\nyou are is truly disheartening. I never\nimagined that you would see me as this\nkind of person. You should know that the\ninformation you're providing hasn't been\nverified yet. But getting you out of\nYongJo safely is something I can do\nimmediately. At the very least, I need\nto make sure the information is true.\nOtherwise, what if I get you out of here\nsafely, only to find out later that\nyou've lied to me? Lu Yao, who had been\nkeeping his head down and not daring to\nlook away. Woo, finally raised his head\nafter hearing these words. However,\nafter hesitating for a moment, he slowly\nspoke. Sir, I know that words are\nmeaningless, but I really want to live,\nwhich is why I'm being so careful. Since\nyou're worried that the information is\nfalse, I have a solution that satisfies\nboth parties. After you accept the\nmoney, sir, I will take you to the\nstronghold so that I can leave Yong Joe\nsafely, and you don't have to worry\nabout being deceived by me. After\nhearing Lu Yao's suggestion, Wayi Wu\nalso felt that it was indeed a good\nidea. Anyway, by then the money was in\nhand and Lu Yaoin was under my control.\nOnce the news of the White Lotus sex\nstronghold is confirmed to be true,\neliminating Lu Yao will be a piece of\ncake. Thinking of this, Wayi Wu nodded\ndecisively. Okay, your method is indeed\ngood. Let's do it your way. Thank you\nfor your magnanmity, sir. In that case,\nI will take you to get the silver first.\nAfter Lu Yao finished speaking, Weii Wu\ndidn't react much, but Shun Lin and Jean\nHai were completely confused. Even when\nthey served in the embroidered uniform\nguard, they had never seen anyone so\neager to offer money. However, judging\nfrom Lu Yao&lt;unk&gt;s expression of relief\nat finally being spared. One can\nunderstand why he did it. After leaving\nHi and Tower, Lu Yao led Wei Wu and his\ngroup through Yanjo City. About 20\nminutes later, they stopped in front of\na house in the south of the city.\nAlthough it is a private residence, it\nis still a courtyard, and from the\noutside, it should be considered a\nrelatively wealthy family. However, the\ngate to the courtyard was locked,\nindicating that the house was vacant.\nJust then, Lu Yao took out a key from\nhis pocket, unlocked the door, and led\nWei Woo and the others into the house.\nThe courtyard inside the house is\nnothing special. It's just a normal\nlittle activity space. As We Woo and his\ngroup stepped through the courtyard into\nthe main house, a cloud of dust rose\nfrom the ground. Upon closer inspection,\nit was discovered that not only the\nfloor, but also the furniture in the\nroom were covered in a layer of white\ndust. At the same time, the room was\nfilled with a strong smell of medicinal\nherbs, but it wasn't pungent. Seeing\nthis, Wayiu was also curious about what\nhad happened to the house. Just as we\nwas puzzled, Liao suddenly spoke up to\nexplain. Sir, Yong Joe has a\nwell-developed water network, which\nmakes it prone to dampness. Houses that\nare not inhabited are more likely to\nbreed snakes, insects, rats, and ants.\nSo, I sprinkled lime and real here to\nprevent excessive moisture and to\nprevent pests. Please forgive me. He was\nsomewhat familiar with what Lu Yao was\ntalking about. The humid weather in the\nsouth was indeed terrifying. I used to\nwatch those videos online and during the\nhumid season, the house would feel like\na waterfall. Weiiu was merely curious\nabout these arrangements. He didn't\nreally mind them since it wasn't his\nhouse anyway. So, after Lu Yao finished\nspeaking, he simply waved his hand. All\nright, it's not my house. Go get the\nmoney first. Lu Yao nodded and then led\na group of people to the room behind the\nmain house. In front of Wayi Woo and the\nothers, he lifted up a floorboard\nrevealing a metal handle hidden\nunderneath. The 500,000 tales of silver\nis all the wealth that Lou left me. To\nbe on the safe side, I divided it into\nthree parts. I hid 100,000 tales of\nsilver in two houses in the city, and\nthe remaining 300,000 tales were hidden\nby me in the mountains outside the city.\nAs he spoke, Lu Yao suddenly grabbed the\nmetal handle and pulled it upwards. Then\nthey saw a thick wooden board about the\nsize of door being lifted up, revealing\na passageway underneath. Wealth should\nnot be flaunted, so I keep all my silver\nin the underground vault below to\nprevent thieves from accidentally\nbreaking in and taking it. It's just\nthat it's dark and damp down there, and\nyou are too delicate for your health.\nLet me take these guards down to get the\nsilver. We would didn't think the\nadjective delicate and precious had\nanything to do with him. However, just\nto be on the safe side, he really didn't\nplan to go down himself. Who knows what\nthe situation would be like down there.\nSo, after Lu Yao finished speaking, he\nsimply nodded and then looked at Jean\nHai. Jean Hai, take two men with Lu Yao\ndown there. Check out the situation and\nthen come back to report. Upon hearing\nwe ws order, Jean Hai immediately\nselected two people without saying a\nword. They sent one person down first,\nthen sent Lu Yao down second and finally\nsent him down as well. This arrangement\nwith one in front and one behind\nsandwiched Lu Yao in the middle\nprevented him from making any\nunderhanded moves. Although Weii Wu\ndidn't say anything, Jean Hai always\ninsisted on the idea that caution is\nalways the best policy. Even if Lu Yao\ndoesn't seem like a threat, he won't\neasily let his guard down. However, this\ntime there was no real danger. After\nentering the passage, Lu Yao first\npicked up a torch from the wall and lit\nit with a tinder box. Then, after\nwalking about 10 m with Jean Hai and the\nother two, the surrounding space became\nmuch larger. This is a seller-like space\nwith large wooden boxes placed in the\nvery center. These wooden boxes were\nmuch larger than the thousand tail\nwooden boxes used by the Imperial Court\nto transport silver. There's absolutely\nno problem fitting 3,000 tales of silver\ninto one box. Jean Hai picked out a few\nwooden boxes, opened them to check, and\nfound that most of them contain silver\nwith a small portion containing gold and\njewelry. He couldn't calculate the value\nof the golden jewelry, but he could make\na simple estimate of the quantity. There\nare about 40 wooden boxes here, and the\ntotal value should be no less than\n100,000 tales. After confirming that\nthere was no danger around and that he\nhad enough money, Jean Hai returned to\nthe entrance of the passage. Young\nmaster, there's no danger down there,\nbut there's too much silver, so it may\ntake a long time to move it. Chapter\n196. A jade seal carved in small seal\nscript inscribed with fate is determined\nby heaven. Too much silver is hard to\nmove. Upon hearing Jean Hai's words,\nWayi Wu suddenly realized a very real\nproblem. He simply couldn't take those\n500,000 tales of silver with him. In the\nMing dynasty, a caddy costs 16 tales. So\n500,000 tales of silver would amount to\nmore than 31,000 caddies. Let alone\nwhether we can bring so much silver with\nus. Even if we could, it would probably\nbe a year before we reach Renshong. It\nseems that I can only exchange them for\npaper money with the government in Yanjo\nfirst and then exchange them for silver\nwith old Jew when I return to the\ncapital. While muttering these thoughts\nto himself, Wei Wu could only sigh\nhelplessly. To be honest, he really\ndidn't want to exchange his gold and\nsilver for something as worthless as the\nMing Dynasty paper money. This thing\nwon't even need decades. In just seven\nor eight years, it will depreciate to\nthe point of being worthless. Old Jew\nwas indeed skilled at fighting on\nhorseback, but when it came to\neconomics, he was an absolute failure.\nThe paper money had no anchor. It was\nprinted as much as needed, completely\nunaware of the disasters caused by\noverprinting. The key point is that\nJudah also set a rule that gold and\nsilver could be exchanged for paper\nmoney, but paper money could not be\nexchanged for gold and silver. This is\nwhy Weii Wu had to return to the capital\nto find Juu Yuan Jang in order to get\nthe silver back because he had to use\nconnections and ask old Jew for\npermission to do it. Even so, he still\nworried that if old Jew saw the silver,\nhe might confiscate it directly. After\nall, this was money from Lu Yao to buy\nhis life, and Lu Yao was a member of the\nLu clan, a criminal whose family had\nbeen raided. According to normal\nprocedures, his money should have been\nconfiscated and deposited into the\nMinistry of Revenue or Zhu Yuan Jangs\nprivate treasury. With this in mind,\nWayi Wu immediately made a decision. He\nwould not exchange the banknotes. They\nbought a house in Yong Joe, put all\ntheir money in it, and then sent someone\nto watch over it. Once this matter is\nresolved, we will send someone to\ntransport the money back to the capital.\nOnce it's in Wu&lt;unk&gt;s pocket, no one can\nget out again. Not even old Jew. He\nwon't allow it. As for silver notes, if\nanyone dares to ask Wayi Woo to exchange\nthem for silver notes, he will\ndefinitely pull out his gun and shoot\nthat person. If he could exchange it,\nwouldn't he know to? The problem is in\nthis day and age there are no such\nthings as banknotes. Silver notes were\nissued by private financial institutions\nlike money shops and used as credentials\nfor large-scale commodity transactions.\nThe problem is that there were no such\ninstitutions as money shops in this era.\nThey only appeared during the Wanley\nperiod. Initially only the exchange of\nsilver and copper coins was available.\nStorage and lending services were added\nlater. It wasn't until theQing dynasty\nthat it was truly possible to deposit\nand withdraw money in different\nlocations and use banknotes as currency.\nThinking of this, Wayi Wu had a flash of\ninspiration. That's right. When we get\nback, we could suggest to old Jew that\nwe set up the money exchange first and\nmake it a government monopoly. By the\nway, let me also mention the hidden\ndangers of paper money, but that\nrequires enough gold and silver as an\nanchor to establish credibility. After\nwe wipe out the Japanese pirates, we\nwill transport the silver back from the\nAwami silver mine and then spread the\nnews to the people. At that time, the\nissue of the bank notes credibility will\nbe resolved, but we still need to open\nup trade and maritime trade to allow the\nmoney to circulate. As Wayi Wu pondered,\nhe became so engrossed in his thoughts\nthat he forgot someone was talking to\nhim. Seeing no response from below, Jean\nHai had no choice but to climb up from\nbelow. Young master, young master.\nHearing the shouts, Wei Wu suddenly came\nto his senses and looked at Jean Hai. I\nwas distracted. All right, bring the\npeople up first. We&lt;unk&gt;ll hold off on\nmoving the money for now. Not long after\nreceiving Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s order, Jean Hai\nreturned with Lu Yao and two\nsubordinates. After they returned to the\nsurface, Wei Wu instructed Shinllin to\ncover the tunnel, then turned to look at\nLu Yao. It's inconvenient to carry this\nsilver. So, let's leave it here for now.\nLet's look at another house in the city\nfirst and then go outside the city last.\nTransport the silver outside the city\nback into Yong Joe. I will arrange for\nsomeone to come and take the silver away\nlater. Lu Yao had no objections, nodded,\nand immediately led Wei Wu and the\nothers away from the house. Next, led by\nLu Yao, the group arrived at a private\nresidence in the north of the city. Just\nlike the previous one, the silver was\nalso placed in a seller-like location.\nThe house and the ground were sprinkled\nwith lime and real, and the amount was\nnot much different from what Lu Yao had\nsaid. All the silver in the city had\nbeen used up, leaving only 300,000 tales\nhidden in the mountains outside the\ncity. After leaving the city gate, Weii\nWu and his party rush to a place 30 m\neast of Yong Joe without stopping. This\nis a mountain forest, not very high,\nonly about 1 or 200 m high. However,\nthis mountain covers a large area and\nhas lush vegetation, making it very\npristine. It must be said that Lu Yao\ndid indeed choose a good location to\nhide the silver. The place where Weii Wu\nwas taken into the mountains was not\neven a path worn by people. It was all\nvegetation. The group walked through the\nwoods for more than an hour, but they\nhadn't even covered half the distance.\nWe rested for about 10 minutes in the\nmiddle and then continued on our way for\nmore than an hour before finally\narriving at our destination. Mountain\nroads are not like flat roads. After 2\nhours of traversing mountains and\nvalleys and with the added obstruction\nof dense vegetation, the journey was\nquite challenging. Not to mention Wei\nWu, even Shan Lin and Jean Hai, who make\na living with knives, were exhausted and\npanting heavily. Only Lu Yao, perhaps\nbecause he's been here so many times and\nis more used to it, is different. He was\nactually in the best condition of\neveryone, only slightly out of breath.\nFortunately, they had arrived at their\ndestination, so they didn't sit down to\nrest. Under everyone's watchful eyes, Lu\nYao used his hand to clear away a spot\ncovered by a large amount of vines. Only\nthen did I realize that there was a\nnaturally formed cave behind the vines.\nHowever, this cave is not the kind of\nearthn cave. It is more like a cave that\nappeared when the rock wall cracked\nopen. The three directions to the left,\nright, and top are mostly rock with only\nthe ground beneath your feet being soil.\nAfter lighting torches and following Lu\nYao inside, they discovered that the\ncave was quite deep, about 10 m deep.\nHowever, the cave was empty. There were\nno wooden boxes or anything like that\ninside. Upon seeing this, Weii Wu\nsubconsciously looked down at the\nground. Based on the layout of the two\nhouses mentioned earlier, it's likely\nthat this cave also has a similar\ncellar. Sure enough, while Wei Wu was\nobserving the ground, Lu Yao went\ndirectly to the deepest part of the\ncave. Then, leaning against the rock\nwall, he moved left and right for a\nwhile, squatted down, and pulled a\nsection of iron chain out of the soil.\nEveryone, please help me. This is too\nheavy. I can't lift it by myself. Upon\nhearing Lu Yao's plea for help, Shinllin\nimmediately arranged for two of his\nsubordinates to go and assist him. No\nwonder Louie UFA asked for help. It took\nthe combined efforts of the three of\nthem quite a bit of effort to open the\nhidden door. It wasn't until the door\nwas fully pulled up that they discovered\nit was made of pure metal. Just like the\nprevious residential houses, Jean Hai\nled his men down with Lu Yao to check\nthe situation while Wei Wu and the\nothers waited upstairs. Perhaps because\nhe had a lot of money this time. Jean\nHai didn't return to the entrance of the\npassage for seven or eight minutes.\nHowever, this time he didn't shout from\nbelow, but went straight back to the\nground and quickly walked up to Wayi\nWoo, whispering, \"Young master, we\ndidn't find anything wrong down there,\nbut we did unexpectedly find a jade\nseal.\" The inscription is in small seal\nscript. I can only understand the three\ncharacters. I mean, fate is determined\nby heaven. I don't know if it's the\ncorrect one, but I dare not touch it.\nChapter 1, 97. The imperial seal of the\nstate. This is too much of a\ncoincidence. Upon hearing Jean Hai's\nwords, we wu&lt;unk&gt;s expression instantly\nchanged and he froze completely. A jade\nseal. The script on it is small seal\nscript and it says fate is determined by\nheaven. These individual pieces of\ninformation aren't so bad on their own,\nbut when put together, they're more than\njust shocking. To be honest, Wayi Wu\nwasn't sure if it was the thing he had\nguessed. After all, it has been missing\nfor far too long, and there are even\nthree different versions of why it is\nlost. But if it really is that thing,\nthen the value of this treasure is\nimmeasurable. After a long while, Weii\nWu, having regained his senses, turned\nto Jean Hai and asked again to confirm.\nAre you sure what you're seeing is a\njade seal with small seal script and the\nthree characters?\nFate is determined by heaven on it. Yes.\nJean Hai nodded in response. So Wu asked\nanother question. About how big is that\nseal? About this size. Jean Hai gestured\nwith his hands to indicate the size\nwhich was about the size of an Apple\ncharger connector. Seeing this, Wayiu\nlowered his head and remained silent,\nbut his brows slowly furrowed. Later\ngenerations do not know much about the\nimperial seal of the state and can only\nmake some guesses based on the era such\nas its eyes. The imperial seal of the\nstate was carved from a heir by jade.\nAccording to the writes, the diameter of\nthe wall will not exceed 18 cm and the\nthickness will be about 0.5 cm. Although\nthere were some changes during the\nspring and autumn period, the thickness\nwas only about 1 cm which was based on a\nstandardized system of rights.\nSimilarly, the seals used in theqin\ndynasty also had specifications which\nwhen converted to later sizes would be\nabout 2 to 3 cm. Of course, some say\nthat the imperial seal of the state was\nnot made from the Heishir by jade, but\nfrom Lion Jade, and it has never been\npassed down, remaining in theQen\nEmperor's tomb to accompany the first\nemperor. Both claims are speculations.\nWithout documents and physical evidence,\nthere is no conclusive proof. To be\nhonest, even Wayi Wu couldn't be certain\nthat the seal Jean Hai discovered was\nthe imperial seal of the state. However,\nthe information he described did indeed\nmatch some of the guesses. So, at this\npoint, I had to say something. Since\nwe're already here, what if it's true?\nThere was also a question that puzzled\nWei Woo. Why did the Imperial Seal of\nthe State end up in a vault where Lu Yao\nhid his silver? And why was it not\ndiscovered for so long? After all, the\nLu family was a gentry family, so it was\nimpossible for them to be completely\nunaware of this treasure. With these\nquestions in mind, Weii Wu asked Jean\nHai again. You just said you discovered\nthis seal by accident. Tell me the\ndetails of how you found it. Yes, young\nmaster. This is what happened. Jean Hai\nthen recounted in detail everything that\nhappened after he entered the tunnel 7\nminutes ago. Just like before when\nentering the house, Jean Hai sandwiched\nLu Yao between them as they walked\nthrough the passageway. Although this\ntunnel is larger than the previous one,\nit is still only wide enough for one\nperson to pass through, but not enough\nfor two people to walk together.\nHowever, after passing through the\npassage, the cellar was much larger than\nthe residential area, and there were\nmany more treasure chests. As before,\nJean Hai immediately selected a few\nwooden boxes, opened them, and checked\nthe contents. This time the box\ncontained not only gold and silver\njewelry but also antiques and\ncalligraphy. There was also a wooden box\npainted red inside which were several\nvery exquisite porcelain vases. Jean\nHghai originally intended to just look\nat them and didn't plan to touch them\nsince these things were too precious. If\nanything goes wrong, he might not be\nable to afford the compensation even if\nhe lost his life. But at that moment, Lu\nYao suddenly picked up one of the\nbottles and stroked it with a reluctant\nexpression. Brave warrior. Everything\nelse is for that, sir. But could I take\nthis bottle with me? Lu Yao hadn't\nspoken up the previous two times, but\nthis was the first time he had taken the\ninitiative to leave something behind.\nJean Hai could tell from the expression\non Lu Yao&lt;unk&gt;s face that Lu Yao was\nindeed very reluctant to part with him.\nHowever, these things did not belong to\nhim. And as Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s subordinate, he\ncould not make that decision. So, after\nLu Yao finished speaking, he simply\nreplied with one sentence. \"No.\"\nAlthough he had already guessed this\nwould be the outcome, Lu Yao still\ncouldn't help but let out a long sigh.\nShe stood there struggling for a long\ntime, looking like she wanted to put it\nback, but couldn't bear to. Seeing his\nappearance, Jean Hai gave a wink to his\nsubordinates. The latter nodded\nknowingly, then stepped forward and\nsnatched the bottle away. Although Lu\nYao was reluctant, he dare not fight for\nit and could only let go. Unexpectedly,\njust as a member of the impermanence\nsquad picked up the bottle, his hand\ninexplicably slipped. Before anyone\ncould react, the bottle shattered on the\nspot. Only after the bottle broke did\nthey discover that it contained a hidden\ntreasure. There was a small space at the\nvery bottom of the bottle, and the seal\nwas hidden inside that space. However,\nLu Yao was so stunned by the broken\nporcelain bottle that he didn't notice\nthe seal. After listening to Jean Hai's\ndescription, Weii Wu showed no joy.\nInstead, his brows furrowed even more.\nIn his opinion, this was just too much\nof coincidence. It just so happens that\nLu Yao brought them to the treasure\nvault, where they happened to encounter\na porcelain bottle containing a hidden\nsecret. and the bottle happened to be\nbroken. It just so happens that there is\na national jade seal inside. It's really\na coincidence that Xiao Xiao's mother\nopened the door for Chia Xiao. Bring our\nmen and Lu Yao up here. Also, bring that\nseal up as well. After pondering for a\nwhile, Wayi Wu finally gave Jeang Hai\nthis order. Since he since something was\nwrong, he definitely wouldn't go down\ninto the tunnel. Bring Lu Yao up first,\nfind out what's going on, and see if he\ncan find any loopholes. Following Wei\nWu&lt;unk&gt;s instructions, Lu Yao was soon\nbrought up by the Wu Chuang squad. He\ndidn't say anything after coming up. He\njust pllopped down on the ground with a\nlook of utter frustration on his face.\nSeeing this, we didn't say anything, but\njust stood aside and carefully observed\nLu Yao&lt;unk&gt;s expression. However, Lu Yao\nsimply took small sips of water from the\nwater bag, and there was nothing wrong\nwith him. So, Wayi Wu simply spoke up\ndirectly. Lu Yao, I have a question for\nyou. Upon hearing Weii Wu's voice, Lu\nYao immediately put down the water bag\nand got up on the ground. Because I got\nup too quickly, I didn't close the water\nbag properly and a lot of water spilled\nout on the spot. But Lu Yao had no time\nto worry about that and quickly walked\nup to Wayi Wu. Sir, may I ask you\nsomething? Looking at Lu Yao's\nexpression, Wayi Wu pondered for a\nmoment before slowly asking that\nporcelain bottle that I accidentally\nbroke just now. He originally wanted to\nask about the origin of the porcelain\nvase, but we wu suddenly stopped halfway\nthrough his sentence. After sniffing the\nair a few times, he turned to look at\nShunlin beside him. Shunlin, can you\nsmell something burning? Upon hearing\nthis, Shunlin also sniffed the air. I\ncan smell it, but young master, it's\nprobably the smell of torches burning\ndown in the tunnel. Wayu shook his head\nand said in denial, \"No, it wasn't there\njust now. It's only just appeared now.\nNo sooner had he finished speaking than\nWeii Wu was about to search for the\nsource of a smell when a raging fire\nsuddenly burst into flames at the cave\nentrance. No one knew what had happened.\nThey only saw flames suddenly leap up.\nFurthermore, the fire was spreading\ninwards along the cave, directly\nthreatening the location where Weii Woo\nand his men were. Chapter 198 No Way\nOut, a dead end. Driven by the wind at\nthe cave entrance, the fire spread very\nquickly. Tongues of fire shot up,\ndancing nimly in the air, and kept\ngetting closer. But that's not the most\nfatal thing. The cave is more than 10 m\ndeep, so even if the fire spreads, it\nwill still take some time. The most\ndangerous thing was that as the flames\nburned, Wei Woo and his men were like\nbeing trapped in an oven. Because the\ncave is mostly made of rock except for\nthe ground, heat can be fully refracted.\nSo even though the flames had just\nstarted burning, the temperature inside\nthe cave immediately rose sharply. The\nkey issue is that as the flames continue\nto burn, the oxygen level inside the\ncave will decrease. If they cannot\nescape quickly, even if they are not\nsuffocated or roasted, they will be\nchoked to death by the smoke from the\nfire. No one expected such a sudden turn\nof events. And no one knows how the fire\nstarted. Although when the flames\nignited, Weii Wu's first reaction was\nthat Lu Yao had done it. But when he\nturned his head, he found Lu Yao staring\nat the fire at the cave entrance with a\nlook of panic on his face. Logically\nspeaking, the most suspicious person at\nthe scene should be Lu Yao. But his\nexpression doesn't seem to fit the bill.\nThe crucial point is that Lu Yao himself\nwas also trapped inside the cave. Unless\nhe was determined to die with his\nfamily, he wouldn't do something so\nstupid. However, regardless of whether\nLu Yao was behind it or not, Wayi Wu has\nno time to consider this issue right\nnow. The most urgent task is to find a\nway to escape. Otherwise, death is\ncertain. However, just as Wei Wu was\npondering a countermeasure, a whooshing\nsound suddenly rang out. Then an arrow\npierced through the raging flames,\ngrazed his head, and struck the rock\nwall inside the cave. Realizing what was\nhappening, Wayi Wu abruptly raised his\nhand and made a downward pressing\ngesture, then shouted loudly, \"Attention\neveryone, there are archers outside.\nStand close to the wall.\" Upon hearing\nWei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s voice, Shunlin, Jang Hai,\nand the members of the Wu Chang squad\nimmediately laid down on the ground. of\neveryone. Only Lu Yao stood there\nfoolishly pressed against the cave wall.\nSeeing that Shan Lin and the others were\nall lying on the ground, he realized he\nshould follow suit. However, at that\nmoment, second wave of arrows emerged\nfrom the flames. Before Lu Yao could\neven lie down, he was struck in the left\nshoulder by a swiftly fired arrow.\nHowever, the shot missed a vital spot\nand Lu Yao still managed to fall to the\nground. Just then, Wayi Wu&lt;unk&gt;s voice\nrang out again from inside the cave.\nEveryone fired freely, although they\nwere lying on the ground. Shan Lin and\nthe others reacted quickly. Upon hearing\nWei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s order, he immediately\npicked up the M4A1,\ncocking and loading it in one smooth\nmotion. Bang! Bang! Bang! A series of\ngunshots rang out, followed by a scream\nfrom outside the cave. However, before\nShinlin and his men could fire again,\nsix more arrows flew out from the\nflames. The number of arrows suggests\nthat there are at least six people\noutside. Fortunately, Wei Woo and the\nothers were lying down. So, the arrows\ndid not cause any damage, but only hit\nthe rock wall inside the cave. However,\neveryone understands that lying prone is\nnot a long-term solution, as they are\nnow facing fierce fire from within and\narchers from without. If they're not\nkilled by arrows in the long run, they\nwill be burned to death by fire unless\nthey can break out. The problem is that\nthis is simply impossible. Even if we\nwoo takes the car out of the system\nspace, it won't make a difference. The\ncave is shaped like the mouth of a\ngourd, and the interior is fairly\nspacious, but it gets narrower as you\nget closer to the entrance. It can be\nsaid that the situation has reached a\npoint where there is a slim chance of\nsurvival. The cave was filled with smoke\nand the temperature was rising. Several\nmembers of the impermanent squad have\nbegun to experience breathing\ndifficulties. Seeing that there was\nreally no other way, we woo took out a\ngas mask from the system space and put\non his head. He only received one of\nthese items from the package, so he\ncouldn't distribute them and had to use\nthem himself. He then took out the riot\nshield he had used before, got up, and\nwent directly to the front of the tunnel\nentrance to hold the riot shield in\nfront of him. As a result, when it was\nstood up, I could feel two impacts, but\nfortunately, no dangerous situation\noccurred. Next, under Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s\ncommand, everyone climbed behind him in\nan orderly manner and crawled into the\ntunnel. Only after everyone had entered\nthe tunnel did we woo quickly speak.\nQuick, tear your clothes, soak them in\nurine, and use them to block the tunnel\nentrance. Seal the hidden door tightly\nso the smoke doesn't get in. Upon\nhearing this, everyone immediately began\nto act as Wei Wu had instructed. Soon,\nseveral diapers appeared at the edge of\nthe tunnel's hidden door, followed by a\nloud bang. The metal hidden door was\ntightly closed, and not a single wisp of\nsmoke could get in. Only then did Wei\nWoo finally breathe a sigh of relief, no\nlonger needing to worry about danger. In\nfact, if there hadn't been absolutely no\nother way, we woo really wouldn't have\nwanted to retreat into this tunnel. The\nreason is simple. This tunnel is a trap.\nOnce you're in, you can't get out. He\nhad no idea what was happening outside.\nNot even when the flames went out. In\naddition, the metal hidden door was\nalready very heavy, so those people\ncould easily tamper with it and seal it\noff. Then all of them were completely\ntrapped in this tunnel. As it turned\nout, Wei Woos guess was correct just\nwhen everyone thought it was safe. Boom.\nA loud bang suddenly erupted from the\ncave outside the hidden door. Upon\nhearing this sound, Wayi Woos face\ninstantly darkened. Explosives. Those\nbastards outside even have explosives.\nAnd the explosion happened inside a\ncave, which meant we would be buried\nalive in this tunnel. Just as Wei Woo\nwas speculating, the sound of rolling\ngravel came from outside the metal\nhidden door, confirming his guess. But\nthat wasn't the worst of it. What was\ntruly desparing was the clanging sound\ncoming from the hidden metal door. The\nworst happened. The hidden metal door\nwas blocked by rocks that had collapsed\nfrom the cave. Once the commotion\noutside subsided, Shanun quickly went to\nthe hidden door and try to push it open.\nHowever, no matter how hard he tried,\nthe hidden metal door remained unmoved.\nThe key issue is that the tunnel is\nnarrow. One person can pass through\ncomfortably, but two people cannot stand\nin it. Even if we tried to gather all\nour strength, we couldn't push the door\nopen. All right, Shinlin, come back.\nDon't waste your energy. This door can't\nbe opened. Put out all the torches and\ncome over to rest. Actually, wasn't\nworried that Shinlin was wasting his\nenergy. He was mainly worried about not\nhaving enough oxygen. This is also why\nhe asked Shinllin and the others to put\nout the torches as burning also consumes\noxygen. Although the seller space\nconnected by this tunnel is not small,\nit is now a completely enclosed\nenvironment. While expending a lot of\nphysical strength, it also consumes\ntheir already limited oxygen reserves.\nSeeing that Shan Lin obediently\nretreated, Wayi Wu took out a flashlight\nand turned it on in diffused light mode.\nHe then sat down on the ground and fell\nin a deep thought. Seeing that we Wu was\ndeep in thought, Shanllin did not dare\nto disturb him and stood Gar by his side\nafter returning. And so the entire\ncellar fell into a deathly silence which\nlasted for about 3 minutes. Weii Wu who\nhad been staring blankly suddenly came\nto his senses and looked at the ground.\nHe then grabbed a handful of soil and\nslowly rubbed it between his fingers.\nEveryone looked at Wayi Wu wondering\nwhat was wrong with him. At this moment,\nwe wu suddenly spoke, his tone slightly\nself-deprecating, so careless, not even\nnoticing something so simple. I've\ndeserved this calamity. After saying\nthat, Wayi Wu turned to look at Lu Yao\nand said in an icy tone, \"But you've\nalready achieved your goal. Are you\nstill going to keep pretending? Or do\nyou insist that I go through a certain\nprocess before you'll confess?\" Chapter\n199. Lu Yao, Marquee of Chong Lu.\nDealing with you is really troublesome.\nUpon hearing Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s words, Lu Yao,\nwho was clutching his injured arm, was\ncompletely stunned. He looked at Weii Wu\nblankly and bewilderedly with an\nexpression that showed he didn't\nunderstand anything at all. Looking into\nWeii Wu&lt;unk&gt;s cold eyes, the confusion\nin his eyes gradually gave way to fear.\nJust as he was about to say something,\nShan Lin and Jeang Hai came his side,\none on each side. Completely ignoring\nhis injuries, they forced Lu Yao to\nkneel before Wei Wu. Because the wound\nwas aggravated, Lu Yao's face turned\npale with pain. He was sweating\nprofusely and his cheeks even began to\ntwitch. Under the suppression of Shan\nLin and Jang Hai, he couldn't even move.\nAll he could do was cry and beg for\nmercy. My lord, I I don't know. I don't\nknow anything. My lord, spare my life.\nMy lord, spare my life. You do not know.\nWeii Wu asked a question in return, then\ndirectly raised a handful of soil in his\nhand and let it slowly slide to the\nground. I just couldn't figure out how\nthat fire started outside and how it\nspread so fiercely. It's only now that I\nrealize you must have planted flammable\noil inside the cave just beneath the\nsoil. Right at this point, Wayi Wu shook\nhis head again with a self-deprecating\nsmile. No wonder they were so eager to\nsend me money. They just wanted to lure\nme into this cave so they could make\ntheir move. I have to say your acting\nskills are really amazing. Of course,\nit's also my fault for being so stupid\nthat I didn't notice a single clue. I\njust don't understand. You've set up\nthis trap, and you're not even sparing\nyourself. Are you really planning to die\nwith me?\" Upon hearing Weii Wu&lt;unk&gt;s\nwords, Lu Yao's eyes widened in\nastonishment, and his mouth gaped open.\nAfter a long pause, he anxiously began\nto explain, \"My lord, I'm innocent. This\nfire has nothing to do with me. I don't\nknow why I turn out this way. A petty\nperson only cares about survival. If it\nwere truly a petty person who started\nthe fire, how could they have burned\nthemselves to death? Moreover, moreover,\nLu Yao wanted to say something more, but\nwe wu interrupted him and took over the\nconversation. And you didn't even touch\nthe fire source, so there was no\npossibility of you starting a fire.\nThat's what you meant, right? As soon as\nwe Wu finished speaking, Lu Yao\nimmediately began nodding vigorously.\nYes. Yes. I only have a water jug on me,\nnot even a tinder box. So, how could I\npossibly start a fire? Lu Yao, you can\nfool others, but not me. Who says you\nneed a tinder box to start a fire? As he\nspoke, Wayi Wu picked up a handful of\nsoil again. You said that the two houses\nwere covered with a lot of lime, but it\nwas actually to lull us into a false\nsense of security. Let us assume this is\nyour habit, and once we get to this\ncave, we'll forget about the lime. But\nin this cave, you also placed a large\namount of lime and it was unburnt quick\nlime. Just now, you deliberately knocked\nover your water bag, taking advantage of\nthe property of quick lime to generate\nheat when it comes into contact with\nwater, and then ignited the ignition\nsource to set off the flammable oil.\nShunlin and Jean Hai were initially\nconfused, unable to understand why Wei\nWu suddenly accused Lu Yao of arson.\nOnly after hearing what we Woo said did\nthey finally understand the reason\nbehind matter. In their impression, Lu\nYao was somewhat clever but cowardly and\nafraid of death. The result is that this\ncowardly fellow has brought them to this\npoint. The anger in my heart exploded in\nan instant. If we Wu hadn't had more\nquestions to ask, the two of them would\nhave been ready to kill Lu Yao right\nnow. However, even after Wei Wu had said\nall that, Lu Yao still maintained that\nwronged expression. Seeing him like\nthis, Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s eyes surged with\nmurderous intent. \"It seems we still\nneed to go through some procedures.\"\n\"Shunllin, bring out the methods you\nlearned in the embroidered uniform\nguard.\" \"Yes, young master.\" Shunlin\nresponded with a sentence and then\nturned to look at Lu Yao. However, just\nas he was about to take action, he\nsuddenly felt a dizzying sensation in\nhis mind. Then his body collapsed\ncompletely out of control. Moreover, not\nonly Shinllin was like this, but Jean\nHai and the other members of the\nimpermanent squad also fell to the\nground. Judging from their condition,\nthey weren't just muddling through.\nTheir eyes were vacant, and they seemed\nsomewhat delirious. Weii Wu narrowed his\neyelids slightly, his eyes flashing like\nlightning as he looked at Lu Yao. Lu\nYao, who had been crying out that he was\ninnocent, suddenly fell into an eerie\nsilence. Immediately afterward, under\nWei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s gaze, Lu Yao slowly stood\nup, and his entire demeanor instantly\nchanged. While meeting Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s gaze\nwithout hesitation, he also raised one\nhand to grab the arrow on his shoulder.\nIn front of Wei Woo, he slowly pulled it\nout of the flesh, letting the blood flow\ndown his arm. He remained expressionless\nthroughout without even uttering a\nmuffled groan. Only after pulling out\nthe arrow and throwing on the ground did\nLu Yao slowly speak, \"Lord Chong Lu,\ndealing with you is proving to be quite\ntroublesome.\" \"Finally, stop pretending,\nlooking at Lu Yao, who was completely\ndifferent from the past,\" Wayi Wu\nreplied coldly. Your guards are all\nlying down, so there's no need to\npretend anymore. What did you do to\nthem? Don't worry. They're just some\nwhite lotus sect members. I'll just\ntemporarily confuse them to prevent them\nfrom causing trouble for me. No one will\ndie. The White Lotus Sex, red scattered\npowder. It's the White Lotus Sect again.\nUpon hearing Lu Yao&lt;unk&gt;s reply, we\nbreathed a sigh of relief. It wasn't\njust for Shan Lin and the others, but\nalso for himself. Although Lu Yao\nclaimed it was the white lotus sex red\npowder after being educated by Sushu\nWayiwood long since stopped being bound\nby the names of medicines. Moreover,\njudging from the current situation, this\nso-called white lotus sect red powder\nmost likely entered the body through the\nrespiratory tract. In other words, Shan\nLin and the others were knocked out by\nthe drugs in the air. But Wayi Wu need\nnot worry because he had been wearing a\ngas mask and had not taken it off. At\nthe same time, I did not feel any\ndiscomfort in my body. However, upon\nhearing what Lu Yao said, he couldn't\nhelp but let out a cold laugh. What do\nyou think that without their protection,\nI'm completely at your mercy? No, no,\nno. I don't intend to lay a hand on you.\nAlthough crushing you is indeed as easy\nas crushing an ant. As he spoke, Lu Yao\nplopped down opposite way. Wu, then\npointed to the surroundings and\ncontinued. But given the current\nsituation, neither you nor I are going\nto survive, so there's no need to waste\nour energy. Is death the only outcome\nfor everyone? Weii Wu was originally\nprepared to pull out a shotgun and show\nLu Yao who the real ant was upon hearing\nhis words. Weii Wu&lt;unk&gt;s heart sank. He\nhad assumed that Lu Yao had other backup\nplans in the cave. Because they felt\nsecure and knew they could leave this\ndesperate situation at any time, they\nremained so calm. However, it now seems\nthat this guy is truly prepared to die\ntogether with his opponent. Looking at\nLu Yao opposite him, Wu frowned and\nasked a question, \"The plot against me.\nYou're willing to risk your own life?\"\nLu Yao chuckled and immediately replied,\n\"I doubt I could have devised a plan to\neliminate you without risking my own\nlife. Chapter 200. From this day\nforward, there will be no more Lu Yao.\nOnly the Red Sun Dharma, King Han Yao.\nGood heavens. They really risked their\nlives just to get rid of me. What grudge\ndo they hold against me that they go to\nsuch lengths? After hearing Lu Yao&lt;unk&gt;s\nanswer, Wayi Wu was speechless for a\nmoment, then changed the subject and\nasked again to avenge my father. It's\nsomewhat related, but not entirely\nbecause of that. It's just that someone\nwants you dead, so you have to die. For\nsome reason, when Lu Yao said those\nwords, he gave Wayi Wu the feeling of a\ndeath knight. It's that feeling of\ncompletely disregarding your own life\nand death and being willing to do\nanything to complete the mission. What\nif I don't die?\nI said if then I will kill you with my\nown hands. Anyway, I will definitely not\ndie before you die. Lu Yao spoke firmly,\nbut Wu pointed to his still bleeding\narm. Then you probably won't outlast me.\nIt doesn't matter. I'll kill you first\nwhen I feel like I'm about to die. Are\nyou really that confident you can take\nme down? That's right. Lu Yao spoke with\nabsolute certainty. But Wayi Wu burst in\na laughter on the spot. Since I'm\ndoomed, why don't you answer two\nquestions for me before I die so I can\ndie knowing the truth? How should I\nremove this white lotus sex red powder?\nAnd you said someone wants me dead. Tell\nme who that person is. Is that too much\nto ask? In fact, Wayiu was just trying\nhis luck to see if he could get some\ninformation out of him. Unexpectedly, as\nsoon as he finished asking the question,\nLu Yao immediately gave an answer. Red\npowder is not poisonous. It's just a\nsleeping potion. You'll wake up\nnaturally in an hour. As for who wants\nyou dead, I don't need to tell you.\nAfter Lu Yao finished speaking, Wayi Wu\nraised his eyebrows and tentatively\nasked the Kong family. That's right.\nThat's not all. Otherwise, where did you\nget this white lotus sect red powder\nfrom? It couldn't have been given to you\nas a toy by someone else. That's right.\nLu Yao's statement is correct, but it's\nunclear whether it's a response to the\nprevious statement or the later one.\nHowever, Wayi Wu understood that\ncontinuing to ask would not yield any\nfurther information. Although Lu Yao was\nanswering his questions, his answers\nwere selective and purposeful, making\nthem unreliable. Whether the Kong family\nwas involved or not is actually\nirrelevant. Wayi Wu should be considered\nas if he was involved regardless.\nHowever, the White Lotus sect must have\nbeen involved since some of its members\nattacked him in Yanjo. Now that it has\nbeen confirmed that Shan Lin and the\nothers are safe, we wu can finally\nrelax. Looking at Lu Yao opposite him,\nWeii Wu grinned and said in a playful\ntone, \"I don't want to die. So, the only\nway I can live in peace is to kill you,\nright?\" \"That's right.\" Upon hearing Lu\nYao&lt;unk&gt;s reply, Wayi Wu raised his left\nhand and tapped the mask on his face.\nYou should know that I was not affected\nby the red powder. I know. Although I\ndon't know what it is, I can guess what\nit does from its usage. After saying\nthat, Lua asked a question with some\ndoubt. Where did you put this before? I\ndidn't see you bring it with you the\nwhole way. You suddenly took it out.\nFaced with Lu Yao&lt;unk&gt;s question, Wayi\nWu simply ignored it and continued\nspeaking to himself. Now that you know I\nwasn't affected by the red powder, do\nyou still think killing me is as easy as\nkilling ants? That's right. No, this\ntime you're wrong and very wrong. Upon\nimmediately became vigilant, staring\nintently at Wei Wu. It was as if any\nmove he made to get up would immediately\ntrigger a thunderous attack. However,\nWei Wu didn't move an inch. He just\nleaned against the rock wall and looked\nat Lu Yao with a calm expression. Just\nas Lu Yao was filled with doubt, Wayiu\ninexplicably produced a strangely shaped\nlong iron rod in his hand. Although Lu\nYao didn't know what this thing was for,\nhe was convinced that it must be very\ndangerous. So the moment he saw this\nthing appear, Lu Yao's body moved. At\nthis moment, he didn't look like an\ninjured person at all. His movements\nwere as swift as his startled hair. At\nthis moment, Lu Yao was no longer the\ntimid and weak man he had been before.\nHe was like a ferocious predator,\npouncing menacingly on his prey. In just\na moment, he not only got up from the\nground, but also came to Weii Wu&lt;unk&gt;s\nside. Unfortunately, no matter how fast\nthe body moves, it can never match the\nspeed of the fingers. This is a valuable\npractical experience that Weii Wu\nsummarized after several wedding nights\nwith Zhu Yuwan. Just as Lu Yao closed\nthe distance and was about to grab Wei\nWu, Wei Wu pulled the trigger with his\nmiddle finger. Boom! With a gunshot, the\nlong spear, which had not been used for\na long time, finally completed its\nfiring. Tiny particles gathered together\nand shot out rapidly from that narrow\nspace. They dragged their long tails and\nrushed towards Lu Yao's young body with\ngreat enthusiasm. Driven by an intense\ndesire for life and fueled by its most\nviolent impulses, it couldn't wait to\nburrow into this body. Ultimately, they\nsucceeded. They fulfilled their mission.\nWithin this young body, beautiful\nflowers representing life bloomed.\nHowever, this flower not only doesn't\nlook beautiful from the outside, it's\nalso quite disgusting. Shotgun fire at\nclose range is something that flesh and\nblood simply cannot withstand. Lu Yao\nwas not only sent flying backward, but\nthe spot where he was hit was also a\nbloody mess. Having completely dealt\nwith Lu Yao, Wei Wu slowly stood up and\ndusted himself off. Seeing that Shan\nLlin and the others had not yet shaken\noff the effects of the drug, he could\nonly search for a way out of the\ntreasure of all alone. Even though I\nknow the chances are slim, I still have\nto try before I can give up. Just as way\nwas searching for a way to escape\noutside the cave. A group of seven or\neight people were holding shovels,\nconstantly shoveling up the surrounding\nsoil and sprinkling it onto the gravel\nat the entrance of the cave. The purpose\nof this is to fill the gaps between the\ngravel with soil, preventing air from\ncirculating in. These people are moving\nvery quickly. It shouldn't be long\nbefore they completely cover the\nentrance. Meanwhile, on a small hillside\nabout 100 m away from the cave, two\nfigures were watching the situation in\nthe cave. The two men, one old and one\nyoung, were none other than Master Jang\nand the young white lotus sect leader\nfrom the tea house earlier. Looking at\nthe cave that was gradually being\ncovered up, Master Jang shook his head\nslightly and sighed softly. What a pity\nsuch a good stand and died in a place\nlike this. Upon hearing Master Cenangs\nwords, the young Dharma King smiled\nslightly and said nonchalantly, \"There's\nnothing to regret. He was just a\nsubstitute. He's dead. So be it. I'm\nplanning to leave Yanjo anyway.\" They\ntraded a double for Wei Wu&lt;unk&gt;s life\nand completely outmaneuvered the Kong\nfamily. This deal was a sure win. Upon\nhearing the Dharma King&lt;unk&gt;s words,\nMaster Jang turned around and looked at\nhim with a surprised expression. Your\nMajesty, are you preparing to leave Yong\nJoe? The young Dharma King shrugged and\nsaid in a relaxed tone, \"Well, if it\nweren't for dealing with my deadbeat\nfather, I wouldn't have stayed here any\nlonger. It's time for me to leave now.\nFrom today onwards, there will be no\nmore Lu Yao, the illegitimate son of the\nLu family. Only Han Yao, the holy sex\nred son Dharma King. Let's go. It's been\na long time since I've been out. Let's\ngo for a stroll in Chingyong.",

Please leave ❤️❤️❤️ in the comments!)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDisclaimer: A rough roar jolted the man from his semi-conscious state. He struggled to lift his head, only to find a heavy wooden yoke around his neck and cold iron chains binding his wrists.\n\nHe was immediately bewildered, trying to clear his jumbled thoughts. Just then, a flood of memories rushed into his mind.\n\nAfter Chen Jiujin fully absorbed this memory, his bewilderment instantly turned to shock! He had been transported to ancient times by accident, becoming a scholar-prisoner exiled thousands of miles away.\n\nWhile being escorted through Qingping County, the county magistrate suddenly died. Because Chen Jiujin happened to possess academic credentials, the escorting soldiers temporarily appointed him as the acting magistrate of Qingping County.\n\nEven more astonishing, the soldiers assigned three female prisoners as his wives. However, the previous nine magistrates of Qingping County had all died mysteriously; his impending appointment was clearly a death sentence! Just as despair welled up in Chen Jiujin's heart, a clear, ethereal voice suddenly rang in his mind: \"Ding - County Magistrate Growth System activated.\n\nDisplays the current state of the county and provides early warnings of crises. Completing system tasks unlocks the system shop, randomly awarding performance points. These points can be exchanged for grain, elixirs, special skills, powerful equipment, etc. Please strive to build and expand your county.\"\n\nAt that moment, despair gradually dissipated in Chen Jiujin's heart, and his eyes hardened. Since he could no longer return to the modern world, he would start now to change his fate!\n\nHe secretly resolved to rely on his modern knowledge to reform the county he was about to control, using business acumen to drive economic development, unite the people, and win the trust and support of his wife, the officials, and even the common folk.\n\nHe would rely on the system and his own wisdom to rise rapidly in this ancient world and establish his own dynasty!\n\nAt this moment, soldier Wang Biao removed the shackles from his neck, casually handing him an appointment document and coldly saying, \"Hurry up and pack your things, get to your post immediately!\"\n\nWith the shackles removed, Chen Jiujin rubbed his aching shoulders, his gaze sweeping over the three \"wives\" he had been brought with him. A sudden, ominous premonition arose in his heart, as if he had just escaped one danger only to fall into another.\n\nSu Zhirou stood obediently beside him, while a young palace maid timidly tugged at her sleeve. The woman named Chu Hongling, however, looked at him with icy eyes, as if already contemplating how to snap his neck.\n\n\"Husband,\" Su Zhirou spoke softly, her voice so gentle it seemed to drip with tenderness, \"Please take good care of me from now on.\" Chen Jiujin could only manage a dry laugh.\n\nQingping County—what kind of den of dragons and tigers was this? And what kind of storms would these three \"wives\" stir up in his new life?\n\n“My lord!” Chu Hongling suddenly spoke, her voice as cold and crisp as a blade tempered in snow water. “I have a condition.” “Speak,” Wang Biao said, crossing his arms and looking at her with a half-smile.\n\n“Give me a knife.” Her gaze was fixed on Chen Jiujin, like a hungry wolf on the grasslands. “To protect my husband.”\n\nChen Jiujin immediately felt the hairs on the back of his neck stand on end. When the three-foot-long sword was thrown at Chu Hongling’s feet, his legs went weak, and he almost knelt down. But Chu Hongling suddenly turned her head and smiled at him.\nAll the story and images/graphics used in the video belong to their respective owners and I or this channel does not claim any right over them (All credits to the respected owner).\n\nCopyright Disclaimer under section 107 of the Copyright Act of 1976, allowance is made for “fair use” for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, education and research.

          "transcript": "In this world, if an 18-year-old awakens\na lord's talent, they have the\nopportunity to enter the battlefield of\nthe myriad races vying for supremacy.\nThe Dragon Sea Kingdom has existed for\n5,000 years. Countless powerful humans\npaved the way for the continuation of\ntheir race, paving the way for the\nstruggle for supremacy among all races\nto give humanity a place to survive in\nthe battlefield of countless races\nfighting against other races. However,\nto date, the Dragon Sea Kingdom and even\nBlue Star are only at the very bottom of\nthe battlefield of the myriad races\nvying for supremacy. Countless powerful\nalien races from other star systems also\nwant to devour this ancient and\nmysterious blue star. The man has been\nin this world for 12 years, and today is\nthe day humanity awakens its lordly\ntalent. Lyn Sha, frank talent piece.\nNext, the middle-aged man beside the\ntesting stone tablet announced\nindifferently. Lyn Sha silently walked\noff the stage. The students laughed\nmockingly. The top student from Jangdong\nnumber three middle school only had an\nF- level talent. With only an F-rank\ntalent, you'd be nothing more than\ncannon fodder in the battle of all\nraces. Haha. Peaceful talent reduces\nmonster hostility by 10%. At this\nmoment, a girl with a cold and aloof\ndemeanor stepped out from the crowd.\nLord Talent Test, please remain quiet.\nShe looked at Lyn Sha as he approached\nand said softly, \"Leave the rest to me.\"\nLyn Shia nodded and watched her walk\ntoward the testing stone tablet. \"Ladies\nand gentlemen, I am Chu Yui, the city\nlord of Jangdong City. Today, you have\ncompleted the Lord talent test and are\nready to enter the battlefield of the\nwar of all races.\" On the other side of\nthe enormous portal in the plaza,\nradiance shone brightly. Chu Yusi\ndressed in a suit stood there. In 5\nminutes, the battlefield for the\nwould begin. On the battlefield, there\nwill be death and injury, but glory and\nachievement await you. May your future\nbe bright, and may the dragon sa kingdom\nprosper. Long live humanity. With a\nchorus of shouts, the portal suddenly\nopened and blazing light shone down.\nLynn Sha felt a sudden brightness before\nhis eyes and his body involuntarily\nentered a bizarre and fantastical time\nspace passage. A few seconds later, a\ncold voice sounded in my ear. Biometric\nverification successful. Lord's identity\nconfirmed. Welcome to the battlefield of\nthe myriad races. You are in the Lon\nregion. You have arrived in your\nterritory and gained 10 minutes of\ninvincibility. Before he could finish\nspeaking, Lyn Sha found himself\nsurrounded by desolation. Beneath his\nfeet lay hard ground, and in the\ndistance stood the Lord's mansion, a\nlevel zero structure. The surrounding\narea consisted of simple buildings and\nlogging camps. The territory was\nenclosed by a wooden fence, and the\noutside world was blurred under the\nshroud of light. Lord's talent\nconfirmed. The voice of the supreme god\ncontinued to ring out. Talent confirmed.\nSSS level talent. Eternal peace. Lyn Sha\nsaw the SSS level talent displayed on\nthe panel eternal peace. He had never\nseen such a talent before. He quickly\nsat down cross-legged, the tattoo on his\nwrist flashing, and then issued the\ncommand. Open personal panel. Lin Sha\nlevel one attributes strength 17 spirit\n18 constitution 15 soul 25 skills\nunrestricted mixed martial arts d rank\nall weapon mastery d rank all unit\ncommand d rank farming s rank combat\npower rating 18 stars lord's talent\neternal peace click to view lin sha\nconfirmed his attributes the average\nperson's four attributes\nstrength, spirit, body, and soul are\nusually between 8 and 10, but his values\nhave exceeded those of ordinary people.\nHe continued examining the SSS level\ntalent and discovered that it was\nupgradable. The talent was divided into\nfive parts. Heaven and earth stand firm.\nIncreases the spiritual energy\nconcentration of the territory by five\ntimes and the probability of sudden\nevents by five times. life and destiny\nincreases crop output speed and mineral\nextraction speed by five times.\nContinuing the lost learning of the\nsages increases learning speed by five\ntimes allows unlimited learning of any\nskill and enables the teaching of\nothers. Eternal Peace increases building\nconstruction upgrade and production\nspeed by 100% and increases city defense\nsystem defense by 100%. Peace for all\nages. Conflict increases troop, divine\nbeast, and hero attributes by 20%,\nloyalty by 20%, troop production by 100%\nand allows access to the divine\nperspective. This talent is simply\nunparalleled, especially the\nestablishing the heart of heaven and\nearth and continuing the lost learning\nof the sages, which shocked Lyn Sha.\nImmediately Lynn Shao realized the\nmysterious token in his mind that had\ntransported him to this world. He\nhurriedly checked it and the system\nissued a notification. Unknown item\ndetected in player. You have obtained\none Hasha token. Hasha token. Unknown\nlevel item bound. Upgradeable. Current\nprogress 1%. Function summoning of\nChina. Consumes energy to summon Chinese\ntroops, mythical beasts, heroes, and\nbuildings of the highest quality. Energy\n1/1.\nFunction: Heroic Spirit Possession\nsummons the heroic spirit of a Chinese\nemperor to possess you, granting you\nimperial abilities for 24 hours. Energy\nFunction: Ascension: Consumes energy to\nascend any item, skill, unit, or hero to\nthe highest level. Energy 1/1.\n5 minutes have passed. His invincibility\nis about to end and his territory is\nfacing a monster threat. Recruit troops\nimmediately. Lyn Sha took out a\nrecruitment talisman. Recruitment\ntalisman. Quality. Common. Function\ndescription. Recruit 10 soldiers of\ncommon quality per team. Ordinary\nrecruitment tokens can generally only\nsummon militia whose combat power is\nrelatively weak. Although there are\nother advanced runes, Lyn Sha can only\nuse this ordinary recruitment token for\nnow before entering the battlefield of\nthe myriad races. All lords talents will\nbe revealed within 24 hours, and many\nwealthy lords will prepare highlevel\nitems for their descendants. If you are\nunprepared, the main god will give you\nthree items of the lowest quality:\nrecruitment token, leader token, and\nheroes token. Lyn Sha made up his mind.\nHe used Hasha summoning, consuming one\nunit of energy to summon a unique Hasha\ntroop. With a wave of Lin Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s\nhand, the ordinary recruitment talisman\ntransformed into a golden talisman in\nthe bright light, interwoven with\nauspicious clouds and mythical beast\npatterns. A portal appeared. 10 figures\nemerged, each clad in fishcale armor and\nwielding a 3meter long weapon, the blade\nof which was fitted with a sharp\ndouble-edged sword. These soldiers had\nresolute faces and cold expressions. Lyn\nSha noticed that they seemed slightly\npuzzled when they first arrived. The\nleader approached Lin Shiao and knelt on\none knee. \"Your subordinate, Tanggi,\ngreets your lordship.\" The other nine\nechoed in unison, \"Greetings, your\nlordship. No need for formalities,\nplease rise. Lynn Shiao waved his hand,\nthen began to observe their attribute\npanels. Emo Dao iron guard tangi race\nhumania level one quality legendary\nattributes strength 38 + 8 spirit 15 + 3\nconstitution 35 + 7 soul 10 + 2 combat\npower 31 stars skills divine valor\npillar of strength bloodthirsty frenzy\nslash with the trend slash against the\ntrend ordinary ary soldiers typically\nhave a combat strength of 1 to three\nstars. While these Mod Dao iron guards\nhave a combat strength 10 times that of\nordinary soldiers, they also enjoy the\n20% all attribute bonus from Lin Xiao's\neternal peace conflict. He looked at\nTang Yi and said in a deep voice, \"Are\nyou Chinese?\" Tanggi looked up and\nreplied, \"Yes, good. This is the\nbattlefield of all races.\" Lyn\nXiao&lt;unk&gt;s voice suddenly rose. My iron\nguards, now that you have joined my\nranks, you must fight alongside me in\nevery battle.\" Tangg Ya&lt;unk&gt;s eyes\nflashed with fervor. And then the 10 men\nshouted in unison, \"We swear to serve\nour lord to the death.\" \"Ding!\" Tangg\nYi, the iron guard of the Mod Dao, has\nreached 100% loyalty, ready to go\nthrough fire and water. With his loyalty\nmaxed out, Lin Sha nodded in\nsatisfaction. Next, he checked the\nLord's Manor panel. Lord's Manor level\nzero quality, common defense, 100 + 100.\nPopulation capacity 200. Not bad. The\nwooden fence can hold out for a while.\nLyn Sha smiled slightly. Now that they\nhad the China token, they would continue\nusing it. Lyn Sha believes that\nsublimation is the fastest recovering\nactive function in the Hasha order.\nFunction enhancement consumes one energy\nto upgrade any item/skll/unit/hero\nto the highest quality. Energy 1/1\nautomatically refills every 24 hours. A\nflash of bright light, the sublimation\ntook effect, and the Lord's manor\ninstantly transformed. Although still a\nlevel zero building, it was more sturdy\nand majestic than ordinary buildings,\nand the wooden fence emitted a faint\ngolden light. The territory instantly\nexpanded to 20,000 square meters. Lord's\nmansion level zero quality. Legendary\ndefense 2,000. Add 2,000. Attributes.\nSpiritual energy revival. Luck revival.\nAbundance power. Healing. Thorn fence.\nSpecial building. Rainbow pool. Click to\nview. Population capacity. 4,000.\nLegendary quality is indeed powerful.\nThe Lord's Mansion's defense and\npopulation capacity have been increased\nby 20 times, and many other attributes\nhave also been added. Click to view. The\nrainbow pool produces 10 to 100 units of\nrandom resources daily. With five times\nthe luck and the spiritual energy\nrevival attribute, the resources will\ndefinitely be good. Lyn Sha thought\nconfidently. He checked the main god\npanel and found that the invincibility\nperiod was about to end. Tanggi arranged\nfor the Mod Dao iron guards to guard the\nterritory, kill any monsters they\nencounter immediately. The iron guards\nof the Mod Dao arrived one after another\njust as the invincibility period ended\nand the light screen in the Lord's Manor\ndisappeared. The surrounding area was\nshrouded in the fog of war. Lyn Sha\ndidn't rush to act. Tangg Yi, you stay\noutside and protect my safety. Yes. Upon\nentering the lord&lt;unk&gt;'s mansion,\nalthough it was a level zero building,\nthe interior was fully equipped and the\nfurniture was exquisite. Lynsha sat down\nand closed his eyes. Used the skill\neternal peace conflict to activate the\ngods perspective. Lyn Sha activated the\nfull view perspective and the viewpoint\nrapidly rose to an altitude of 10,000 m\noverlooking the entire battlefield. The\nfog of war was ineffective. However, the\ncelestial perspective cannot cover the\nentire starting village number 89757\nbecause the map is too large. Celestial\nperspective 0/1 requires charging.\nCurrent progress 0%. The view lasted\nonly 10 minutes. Lyn Sha adjusted the\nview and found that the territory was\nlocated among a large mountain right at\nthe mouth of a valley. This is a classic\ngourd-shaped terrain suitable for\ndefense. But if it is blocked by the\nenemy, the consequences would be\nunimaginable. Fortunately, there are\nabundant resources behind the territory\nwhich can be used to expand it. Lyn Sha\ncontinued to adjust his view, observing\nthe surrounding resource points and\nmonsters. Iron ore, copper or silver or\ncrystal or everything you could want.\nThere's a squad of phantom archers to\nthe west. An excellent unit, quite\nstrong. There is a nest demon next to\nthe mercury mine. It is a level 30 epic\ncreature and extremely powerful. If you\nencounter it at the beginning of the\ngame, you will definitely die. The\ncentaur layer is also nearby and it\ncontains elite warriors. The fog of war\nsurrounds all unexplored areas where\nresources and monsters are hidden. The\nterritory of a new lord may be\nsurrounded by low-level monsters or\ndeadly highle monsters. Lyn Sha used his\ndivine perspective to quickly explore\nand memorize all the important\ninformation. He began recording\ninformation about the area around the\nvalley and scanning the Lord's mansion\nfurther away. The chat channel in the\nnewbie village number 89757\nhas become active. Hello everyone, I'm\nnew here. Please be kind to me. My name\nis Dinglay. Please take care of me from\nnow on. The chat exploded instantly.\nDinglay, that academic genius with\nA-level lord talent. I've met a master,\nan A-rank talent. Only one in tens of\nthousands. My E-rank talent. I'm\nbasically doomed. Just as everyone was\npreparing to join Dinglay&lt;unk&gt;s\nalliance, several unfriendly voices\nemerged. Is Jang Dong number one middle\nschool really that good? Dingle, is he\nreally a good player? This outrageous\nprovocation immediately sparked outrage\namong Ding Lay supporters. Who are you?\nHow dare you speak to Ding Lay like\nthat? The other party retorted\ndismissively, \"I'm Xiao Datang. I'm Gene\nDang. We're&lt;unk&gt; from the International\nBilingual Academy. So what?\" Dinglay was\nhelpless. Although he had A-level\ntalent, he could only carry two\nexcellent recruitment tokens, which was\nno match for them. 10 minutes later, Lin\nShiao ended his celestial perspective.\nHis view returning from the sky to his\nsurroundings. Excellent. Time to begin\nthe exploration. He checked the chat\nhistory. He wanted to reach the top of\nthe leaderboard, obtain massive rewards,\nand most importantly, get the hero rank\none reward. Lyn Sha walked out of the\nlord's hall with Tang Yi guarding in\nfront. Upon seeing Lin Shao, Tanggi\nimmediately bowed and said, \"Lord,\nTanggi, summon all the Mod Dao iron\nguards. There are small monsters in the\nnorthwest corner that will arrive in\nthree minutes.\" Yes, Tang Yi responded\nand quickly summoned the Mod Dao iron\nguards. Lin Shao arrived at the\nnorthwest corner and noticed the war fog\nin the distance. Soon after, several\ndark-skinned long-toed caveman appeared\nin the fog. Caveman level one, quality,\ncommon power, three stars. Caveman\ncenturion level, four, quality,\nexcellent combat power six stars. Lynn\nSha glanced at it disdainfully, then\nordered, \"Attack!\" Tang Yi slashed\nseveral cavemen in half with a single\nstroke. Green blood splattering\neverywhere. Tang Yi kills four cavemen,\ngains 480 experience and four energy.\nThe Mod Dao iron guards advance steadily\nand quickly clear out the remaining\ncavemen. Tang Yi killed the caveman\ncenturion and gained 400 experience,\nthree energy, 15 gold coins, two rare\nleader tokens, and one rare treasure\nchest. Lyn Sha saw the dropped items. He\nwas lucky. Suddenly, Lyn Sha realized\nthat the energy was used to charge the\nHasha token. My lord, the enemy has been\nwiped out. Please give the order.\nDispose of the corpses. No one can use\nthem, Lynsha commanded. I just happened\nto get a rare citizen token, which can\nbe used to summon rare farmers to\ncollect resources. Lyn Shia took out two\nrare leader tokens and one ordinary\nleader token given by the main god and\nsummon them together. The ascension\nskill is still on coold down, but he\nstarts the game with a team of rare\npeasants and a team of regular peasants.\nSummon farmers. A flash of light\nappeared and small portals reappeared\nwithin the territory from which farmers\nemerged one by one. Their clothes were\nsomewhat worn and they carried farm\ntools, toolboxes or baskets on their\nbacks. 30 farmers walked out of the gate\nand knelt down to pay their respects.\nGreetings, Lord. Rise all of you. Lyn\nSha nodded in acknowledgement, then\nbegan assigning tasks to the farmers.\nYou go to the forest 300 m west of the\nterritory to cut timber. You go to the\nmine 50 m south to dig for stones. The\nrest of you come with me and Tanguan to\ngather resources. One of the rare\nfarmers suddenly knelt down. My lord,\nthe outside is shrouded in the fog of\nwar, and we have never explored it. He\nknew that the fog of war was thick with\nmonsters and dangers, and he feared that\nthe Lord would send peasants to scout\nahead. Many lords initially had only 10\npeasants, but now they have 30, and they\nfeel that Lin Xiao is sending his\npeasants on a dangerous mission. Lyn\nXiao&lt;unk&gt;s eyes flickered, and Tang Yi\nimmediately noticed, slamming his long\nsword into the ground. Several cracks\nappeared in the ground. How dare you?\nThe farmers, terrified, immediately\nknelt down. Lord, spare us. It's all\nright. Lynn Sha waved his hand. Just go\ngather resources. Don't worry. I have\nstrong troops protecting me. The\nlocation is safe and there are no\nmonsters around. The farmers breathe a\nsigh of relief and set off. Soon, their\nvoices rang out. I've reached the stone\nquarry. There really aren't any monsters\nhere. We've reached the forest and we\nhaven't encountered any monsters along\nthe way. Let's start gathering. As the\nfarmers moved forward, the fog of war\ngradually dissipated. An even bigger\nsurprise followed. How come my data\ncollection speed is so fast? Me, too.\nI'm not tired at all. It must be the\nLord's special ability. That's great. My\nabilities are now stronger than an epic\npeasant. Lynn Shia smiled slightly,\nknowing that this was the effect of his\ntalent. Peace for all ages, life and\ndestiny for the people. Sustaining life\nincreases crop output by five times,\naccelerates crop maturity by five times,\nand increases resource gathering speed\nby five times. Even rare farmers have\nincreased their gathering speed by five\ntimes, making them as efficient as epic\nfarmers. Lynn Sha responded calmly. This\nwill make you better farmers. You might\neven be able to become legendary\nfarmers. The farmers shouted in unison.\nWe commoners will forever follow our\nlord. Ding. Your ordinary and rare\nfarmer loyalty has reached 100. At this\npoint, he was ready to proceed with the\nnext step. Lyn Shiao instructed, \"You\neight farmers. Go with me to collect\nresources. Tanggi, you take two Mod Dao\niron guards and we'll go in another\ndirection to clear out the monsters. The\nremaining eight farmers will come with\nme. The remaining two Mod Dao iron\nguards will guard the territory.\" Lynn\nShiao divided his forces into two\ngroups, preparing to quickly kill\nmonsters and occupy resource points. The\niron guards of the Mod Dao were\nterrified, and Tangi immediately knelt\ndown to dissuade them. Lord, you must\nnot go into battle personally. My lord,\nleave the fighting to us. You are the\nLord, and you must not get hurt. In the\neyes of the Mo Dao Iron Guards, Lyn\nShiao was worthy of their loyalty, but\nhis strength seemed insufficient. Lyn\nXiao's 18star personal ability is\nundoubtedly top tier in the beginner\nzone, but he is still somewhat weak\nagainst legendary units. Let's try the\nheroic spirit possession technique. Lin\nXiaoing took out the Chinese token and\nsilently chanted, \"Use the Chinese\ntoken.\" Heroic spirit possession\nfunction. Heroic spirit possession\nconsumes one energy to summon the heroic\nspirit of a Chinese emperor to possess\nyou, granting you some of his abilities\nfor 24 hours. A flash of golden light.\nWhat is this? The MO Dao iron guards and\nthe farmers all knelt down, feeling an\nincomprehensible pressure. As the golden\nlight faded, Lin Sha felt the power of\ncountless heroic spirits of Chinese\nemperors. At that moment, a valiant\nphantom slowly approached him and\npossessed him. Xiang Ji, Overlord of\nWestern Shu, ability borrowing level\none. Fusion level very low. Duration 24\nhours. Skills: Supporting Strength:\nFathered Valor, Desperate Measures,\nOverlord Spear Command, Rank A. Xang Yu.\nThe first time Lin Sha summoned a heroic\nspirit of China, it was Xiang Yu, one of\nthe strongest emperors in ancient China.\nAmong the five skills, the command a\nlevel skill provides a 30% bonus to all\nattributes for all troop types. When\ncombined with Lin Xiao's own talent, it\nincreases the total attributes of all\ntroop types by 50%. Lin Shia checked his\nattribute panel. Lyn Sha level one\nattributes strength 17 plus 250 spirit\n18 + 100 constitution 15 + 200 soul 25 +\n110 skills unrestricted mixed martial\narts d rank all weapon mastery d rank\nfarming cir rank lifting strength\nfeathered courage last stand overlord\nspear command a rank combat power rating\n18 stars. Lord talent. Peace for all\nages. These attributes are ridiculously\nstrong. He took out a purple rare\nquality spear from his backpack. This\nwas a prize he had brought back from the\nblue star world. Lyn Sha gripped the\nspear. It was usable, if not perfect.\nRise, all of you, and follow me into\nbattle. Lyn Sha commanded. The iron\nguards of the Mod Dao raised their heads\nand looked at Lin Sha with reverence as\nif they saw a heroic phantom behind him.\nWe swear to follow our lord to the\ndeath. Lyn Shao led Tang Yi and three\nother Modo Dao iron guards forward. Soon\nthey arrived at a monster encampment\nguarding a sulfur mine. Upon seeing the\nfew people there, the monsters roared\nand pounced. Lava giant lizard level\neight. quality, excellent combat power,\n10 stars. Dozens of lava giant lizards\nrapidly approached, but Lynn Shiao\ncalmly swung his spear, activating the\noverlord spear skill, sweeping away\nnearly 10 giant lizards. You have killed\na lava giant lizard 8, gaining 2,400\nexperience, eight energy, and 56 gold.\nLord, you are mighty. The iron guards of\nthe Mod Dao immediately followed,\nrushing into the monster horde and\nslaying the giant lizards. Your unit,\nTanggi, killed two lava giant lizards,\ngaining 600 experience, two energy, and\nsix gold. Seconds later, all the giant\nlizards had been killed. However, a huge\nlava giant lizard lord appeared and\npounced on Lyn Sha. Tanggi prepared to\nfight back, but Lynn Shia preemptively\nsaid, \"It's been a long time since I've\nstretched my muscles. Leave it to me.\"\nThe lava giant lizard lord charged\nstraight at Lin Shiao, who met it\nhead-on, and punched it in the head,\nunleashing the power of a pillar,\nactivated, Lin Xiao's strength surged.\nWith a single punch, the lava giant\nlizard lord's head was instantly smashed\ninto the ground. You have killed the\nlava giant lizard lord, gaining 2,100\nexperience and five energy. A flash of\nwhite light and the voice of the supreme\ngod rang out. Loot equipment. Liao&lt;unk&gt;s\neyes flickered and he directly obtained\nthree precious items. A mini tavern, an\nexcellent treasure chest, and a black\nlong sword. The mini tavern is a tiny\nbuilding model that can be placed\ndirectly on your territory to quickly\ntransform it into a real tavern. saving\na lot of resources. The excellent\ntreasure chest shimmers with a purple\nlight, and the items inside are\nguaranteed to be of excellent quality.\nIt is a rare blind box in the\nbattlefield of all races. Lyn Sha\ndecided not to open it yet. Then he\nlooked at the black long sword. Black\nlong sword quality blue rare.\nAttributes: base attack 180, strength\nplus 10, spirit plus 10. Description: A\nweapon suitable for night battles. light\nand sharp with a black blade to reduce\nglare. Although the sword was good, Lynn\nShiao had no need for it. So, he put it\nup for auction, setting a starting price\nof 2,000 gold coins and a buy it now\nprice of 3,000 gold coins. At the very\nbeginning of the game, rare equipment\ncan fetch a good price, especially for\nplayers who spend money on the game, as\nthey often have a lot of gold coins and\nvouchers. After finishing these tasks,\nLynn Shiao turned to occupy the sulfur\nmine and instructed the farmers. You go\nand collect materials from the lava\ngiant lizards. Follow me when you're\ndone. The sulfur or isn't needed right\nnow, but these materials must be\ncollected first. Yes. The farmers\nobeyed, taking out their daggers and\nbeginning to cut the lava giant lizards.\nYou have obtained five pieces of lava\ngiant lizard meat, five pieces of lava\ngiant lizard hide, and five pieces of\nlava giant lizard blood. At the same\ntime, a notification sounded. Your unit,\nthe Iron Guard, Tang Chuan, has killed\nthree goblin warriors, gaining 600\nexperience, three energy, and eight\ngold. At this moment, there was still a\nhero's token in the backpack. Heroes\nplay a crucial role in the struggle for\nsupremacy among all races, even\nsurpassing lords in importance.\nRecruiting heroes requires a tavern, a\nlevel one lord's manor and a hero's\ntoken. Lyn Sha happens to have a tavern\nthat can be built quickly, and he only\nlacks the resources for a level one\nlord's manor. We must race against time\nand recruit heroes before anyone else.\nLyn Shao thought to himself as he led\nTangg Yi and the Emo Dao iron guards to\ncontinue their battle against the wild\nmonsters. Meanwhile, the chat channel\nbecame active again. I saw a rare blue\nlong sword in the auction house. What\nrare equipment dropped less than an hour\ninto the game? Wait, was it the sword\nLin Sha sold? Lyn Shia? That genius\nstudent from Jangdong number three\nmiddle school? Yes, the one who's number\none in the grade. Many new lords flocked\nto the chat, expressing their desire to\nadd Lin Shiao as a friend, with some\neven suggesting that he be brought into\nthe alliance. However, Ziao Dang jumped\nout to mock that so-called academic\ngenius. I'd like to see just how amazing\nhe is. Lyn Sha cleared out three monster\nlayers and seized the copper and iron\nmines. Now, he was preparing to\nchallenge the monster treasure house.\nMonster treasure house is a rare outdoor\nbuilding in the battlefield of the\nwaring states with an extremely low\nappearance rate. The monsters inside are\nat least level 10 and the strongest can\nreach level 20 just as he was preparing\nto lead the moa iron guards to\nchallenge. The main god system suddenly\nnotified him that someone had initiated\na video communication request. Chufinga\nLynsha laughed. The video showed a young\nman with dyed red hair. Chufinga. Of\ncourse, this young master is in the same\nstarting village as the famous genius\nLin Sha. Chufinga said smugly. I didn't\nexpect that after you dyed your hair,\nyou'd also learned so many vulgar words.\nDoes the old man know? Lyn Sha teased.\nHey, don't mention him. Chufungo waved\nhis hand. Wait, is that the monster\ntreasure house behind you? Dude, you're\nonly level one and you're already\nchallenging the monster treasure house.\nLynn Shiao smiled faintly. We have to\ntry. Chufingo was silent for a moment.\nLyn Sha, although your talent is strong,\nyou only have a chance to become\nstronger if you're alive. All right, I\nunderstand. Lyn Shao interrupted him.\nYou know I'm tough as nails. Fine.\nChufing aside. He opened the chat\nchannel and saw many people mocking and\ndisdainful, but he didn't care. Upgrade.\nLyn Sha waved his hand to command. The\nMod Dao iron guards gained a large\namount of experience and quickly leveled\nup to level three. Thank you, Lord. The\niron guards of the Mod Dao clan led in\nunison. Lin Shia nodded solemnly. After\nwe enter the monster treasure house,\nmonsters will swarm in from all\ndirections. Lin Sha led Tangg Yi and the\nother three Emo Dao iron guards into the\nmonster treasure house where they were\ninstantly teleported inside. The scene\ninside the room relieved Lynn Shiao.\nDozens of Minotaur guards were waiting\nfor them. Minotaur guards level 18.\nQuality excellent. Combat power rating\n48 stars. Skills, high morale, endurance\naura, blood lust. These minotaur guards\nare enormous and wield double axes.\nAlthough powerful, they are physical\nattack type monsters. The minotaur\nguards charged forward. Tangg Yi and the\nother three iron guards with broadswords\nquickly formed a defensive line,\nprotecting Lin Sha within it. Lyn Shao\noriginally intended to have them\nretreat, but then he thought it would be\na good opportunity to see if the level\nfour Emo Dao iron guards could handle\nthe level 18 Minotaur guards. The\nMinotaur's twin axes slashed down at\nTang Yi with a terrifying whooshing\nsound. His blood lust skill was\nactivated. The minotaur was preparing\nfor a fatal blow, but Tangi stood firm.\nThe pillar of strength skill of the Mod\nDao Iron Guard was activated, greatly\nincreasing his attributes with a\nsignificant rise in strength, spirit,\nand constitution. Pillar of strength.\nWhen facing a superior enemy force that\noutnumbers your own, morale, and\nattributes are boosted, and the effect\nis doubled when protecting the lord. The\nminotaur guard swung his ax down\nsuddenly, but Tang Ya&lt;unk&gt;s long sword\nswiftly swept it away. The long sword\nstruck the minur like lightning,\ncleaving him in two. Your unit, the iron\nguard of the Mod Dao, has killed a minur\nguard, gaining 10,000 experience, 30\nenergy, and 150 gold. Then came two new\nenemies. One Minotaur chose to fight\nhead-on, while the other tried to flank\nTang Yi. Lynn Sha gripped his spear,\nready to provide support at any moment.\nTangg Yi charged at the minur in front\nof him, slashing down with his sword.\nThe minotaur's double axes were easily\ncleaved in two, and his long sword\nbecame stuck in his shoulder armor,\nblood splattering everywhere. At the\nsame time, the Minotaur s double axes\nfrom the side were rapidly closing in on\nTang Yi. However, just as the enemy was\nfeeling triumphant, a cold light\nsuddenly flashed and the minur who was\nattacking from the side was unexpectedly\ncut in two. That cold light was the\neffect of Tang Yi using reverse slash.\nThe blade was extremely fast and the\ncounterattack was even faster. Reversal\nslash triggered when the enemy blocks or\nis not instantly killed, delivering\nanother fatal blow. Cannot be dodged or\nblocked. Upon seeing this, the minotaur\nin front of them was immediately filled\nwith fear and prepared to continue its\nattack. Tanggi sneered and swung his\nlong sword once more. Another flash of\ncold light appeared and three minotaurs\nwere instantly killed. One of them was\nthe minotaur that blocked the attack\nheadon, while the other two were killed\nwith a single blow as they charged\nforward. Is this the power of legendary\nunits? Lyn Sha was shocked. A level four\nunit challenging a level 18 unit,\nkilling four minotaurs with three\nstrikes. It's simply heaven defying. The\niron guard of the Mod Dao possesses five\npowerful skills, each of which is enough\nto drive enemies to despair. Lyn Shaigh,\nthe Mod Dao Iron Guards are truly\nunreasonable and powerful. They become\nstronger when faced with strong\nopponents, and the more enemies they\nhave, the stronger they become.\nSuddenly, Lyn Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s gaze froze as\nhe recalled memories of his previous\nlife. The iron guards of the Mod Dao.\nLyn Shiao suddenly realized that this\nMod Dao soldier was very likely from the\nMod Dao army of the Tang Dynasty in his\nprevious life. He recalled a record in\nthe Tang Dynasty's six codes. The Mod\nDao was carried by infantrymen. The\nsword weighed 15 caddies, was 7 ft long,\nwith a blade 3 ft long, and a handle 4t\nlong. The MO Dao army capable of\ncleaving through Centtor has now cleaved\nthrough Minotaur. Doesn't that make\nsense? Lynn Sha smiled, a surge of pride\nwelling up inside him. This Mod Dao\nsoldier truly lives up to his\nreputation. Chapter 11. It's his good\nfortune to have gotten involved with me.\nYou have successfully defeated all the\nguards in the Monster Treasure House.\nRewards are being calculated. The voice\nof the Supreme Deity rang out. Battle\nresults. Annihilate the following\nenemies. 47 Ta guardians. Excellent. And\nthree Tan elite guardians. Excellent.\nBattle duration 2 minutes and 11\nseconds. Our casualties zero. Special\nbonuses. First to break through the\nmonsters treasure house in the entire\nregion. The lord personally participates\nin the battle and the level difference\nbetween the lord and the troop type\nexceeds 10 levels. Reward one, 235,000\nexperience, 5,600 gold, 480 energy, five\nexcellent quality spirit fields, one\nepic quality treasure chest, one scale\nrock breastplate. Reward two, 1,000\nwood, 1,000 stone, 1,000 iron ore, 1,000\ncopper, or 1,000 silver, or 100 gold or\n100 sulfur. Looking at the reward, Lin\nShia exclaimed excitedly. I got an epic\ntreasure chest. What a pleasant\nsurprise. He glanced at the resource\npanel. Experience 705,000.\nGold coins 13785.\nFine treasure chests three dropped by\nsmall monsters. Rare treasure chest one.\nExcellent treasure chest one. Epic chest\none. Other mini tavern one. Excellent\nquality spirit field five. Black long\nsword one scaled rock breastplate one\nspecial battlefield energy of all races\n1250 resources timber 4700 stone 4550\niron or 2,100 copper or 2,100 silver or\n1,000 gold or 100 sulfur 100. He decided\nnot to delay any longer and to hurry\nback to his territory to upgrade the\nlord's manor. He would recruit heroes\nafter the tavern was built. Tangg Yi\nsummon all the Mod Dao Iron Guards back\nto the territory, he commanded. Yes, my\nlord, Tanggi replied. On the other side,\nZiao Daong and Jin Dang had just\nfinished their battle. The silverback\nwolf had been dealt with by the harpy.\nZiao Datong sat down and complained.\nDamn it, there was actually a rare\nmonster, the silverback wolf. Two of my\nlizard cavalrymen have died,\" Xiaoa\nDaong said angrily. Gene Dang sighed\nhelplessly. \"This is the route you\nsuggested. It's&lt;unk&gt; too risky. If we\nencounter rare monsters that are level\n10 or higher, we won't even be able to\ndefeat them altogether.\" Xiao Datong\nretorted indignantly. \"Who told you not\nto bring the wild boar rider? Now I have\nto go into battle myself. My sword is\nalmost dulled. We need to stockpile\nresources when clearing land. Look, I've\nprepared rare hero tokens. Once I\nrecruit heroes, I'll definitely be able\nto sweep through the newbie village.\nGene Dang said confidently. Xiao Dong\nlooked at him and said, \"You seem quite\nconfident, but look at my combat\nstrength. It's not even enough for an\neight-star character.\" Xin Dang smiled\nand said, \"That's because you're not Lyn\nShao. You know, he has a combat power of\n15 stars, plus the special evaluation\nfrom the main god, making him\npractically invincible in early game\nambushes. Xiao Datong gritted his teeth.\nThat guy's luck is too good. He even\nmanaged to get a black long sword. Gene\nDang nodded. Yes, he fought monsters all\nby himself, so the main god gave him a\nhigher evaluation. Don't you think his\ncombat power would be even stronger if\nhe got that sword? Xiao Datangs eyes lit\nup. If I had that black long sword, my\ncombat power would be even stronger than\na 15 star. The two stared at each other\nfor a moment. Then Ziao Datong\nwhispered, \"He dares to sell the sword\nfor 3,000 gold coins? Who would buy\nthat?\" Jin Dang suggested, \"Why don't we\nforce him to sell at a low price?\" Xiao\nDatong laughed. He's just a penniless\nand powerless wandering lord. How could\nhe possibly withstand our three teams of\nrare troops? He then sent a message in\nthe chat channel. Lin Shiao, this is\nXiao Dong Lizard Cavalry. Click to view\nwith your Franked Talent. It must be\ntough on the battlefield of the myriad\nraces, right? Your black long sword has\nbeen sitting there for so long and no\none's bought it. How about we become\nfriends and you give me the sword? I'll\noffer you protection once. How about\nthat? It's&lt;unk&gt; your good fortune to be\nable to connect with me. Xiao Datong\nsaid confidently. Chapter 12. Opening\ntreasure chest still requires faith in\nmysticism. Xiao Dangs comment in the\nchat channel sparked a round of\nlaughter. Xiao Datang, the lizard\nknight. That's a really strange name.\nSomeone from a prestigious school wants\nto get Lin Xiao's equipment for free.\nHow can you provide protection if you\ndon't even have 3,000 gold coins? Isn't\nwhat brotherhia Dang did inappropriate?\nI Heay believe this is robbery. Ziao\nDang roared, Shut up. I wasn't talking\nto you. Gene Daong immediately spoke up.\nI'm with Xiao Shang. Who has a problem\nwith that? Wild boar rider harpy at\nheay. Do you have a problem with this?\nDisaster talisman. The chat channel was\nsilent for a few seconds. No one dared\nto speak. These two displayed three rare\ntroop types enough to place them among\nthe top in the starting village. Even\nmore terrifying, Gene Dang also\npossessed a suppression talisman. This\nallows him to legally launch\nsuppressions without being punished by\nthe main god system. Seeing the quiet\nchannel, Xiaoang spoke again with\nsatisfaction. At Lin Shiao, add me as a\nfriend and let's chat privately. You did\na good job. I'll give you a chance to be\nmy friend. Lyn Sha returned to his\nterritory, saw Xiao Desang&lt;unk&gt;s\nmentions and chat history, and sneered.\nSorry, not interested. If you want the\nequipment, go buy it yourself. After\nsending the message, Lin Sha closed the\nchat channel and directly opened the\nLord's Mansion interface. Lord's Mansion\nlevel zero quality legendary defense\n2,000 plus 2,000. Attributes spiritual\nenergy revival luck revival abundance\npower healing thorn fence special\nbuilding rainbow pool capacity for\nthousand upgrade requirements for\nthousand wood for thousand stone 1500\niron ore 1500 copper ore. He chose to\nupgrade without hesitation. Upgrade\ncountdown 11 hours 59 minutes and 59\nseconds. Lynhia's talent, Eternal Peace,\nincreases building and upgrade speed by\n100%. Upgrades that originally took 24\nhours now only take 12 hours. It's 11:55\na.m. now, less than 2 hours before the\nBattle of the Myriad Races begins. He\nplans to complete the upgrade and\nrecruit heroes before midnight tonight.\nTo deal with the demonic tide, we need\nto increase our troops first. He decided\nto open the treasure chest. In less than\ntwo hours, Lynn Shiao had accumulated\nthree excellent treasure chests, one\nrare treasure chest, one superior\ntreasure chest, and one epic treasure\nchest. The Lord's Manor is being\nupgraded, and he begins opening treasure\nchests. Open the superior treasure chest\nfirst. You have opened a fine treasure\nchest one and obtained 1561 fine iron.\nYou have opened a fine treasure chest\none and obtained 1734 fine bronze. Lyn\nSha frowned. Looks like I need to wash\nmy hands. He washed his hands again,\nreturned to the Lord's manor, and\ncontinued opening treasure chests. Open\nthe excellent treasure chest. You have\nopened a fine treasure chest and\nobtained the following equipment. A fine\nfishbone breastplate. Open the rare\ntreasure chest. You have opened rare\ntreasure chest one and obtained one rare\nrecruitment token. Excellent hard\ncurrency. Next, open the excellent\ntreasure chest. You have opened the\nexcellent treasure chest one and\nobtained one scale rock shoulder pad.\nSeeing the scale rock shoulder pads, Lin\nShia was in a good mood. Perfect. I got\na scale rock breast plate. While farming\nTarantin, he checked the equipment\nattributes. Scaled rock breastplate set\ntwo fifths. Quality purple excellent\nattributes. Base defense value 155.\nStrength + 10. Constitution + 10. Scale\nrock shoulder pads set two- fifths.\nQuality purple excellent. Attributes\nbase defense value 85. Strength plus 10.\nConstitution plus 10. Special attribute\nignores all four stats. Attack speed\nincreased by 3%. Ding. The lord\npossesses two pieces of the scaled rock\nheavy armor set. Triggering set bonuses.\nSet bonus. Scaled rock heavy armor set.\nTwo-fifths strength plus 10.\nConstitution plus 10. Lyn Shia smiled\nwith satisfaction when he saw the two\npieces of equipment. Although the epic\ntreasure chest hadn't been opened yet,\nhe was already laughing. Opening\ntreasure chests really does require\nbelieving in metaphysics. Chapter 13.\nAre you really archers? I'll wear the\nscale rock heavy armor myself. That way,\neven without the emperor's spirit\npossessing me, I can still maintain\ndecent combat power. Lyn Shao said\nself-deprecatingly. In this way, I'll be\nmore like a true wandering lord. Ranger\nlords are lords who fight for supremacy\namong all races by relying on their\npowerful military strength. Unlike other\nlords who focus on territory\ndevelopment, they invest all their\nresources in improving themselves. When\nLyn Xiao's talent awakened, it was at\nthe F rank. His friends all advised him\nto take the path of a wanderer. After\nall, the lord's talent was too weak, and\nhe had no background. Only by focusing\non improving himself could he survive in\nthe battlefield of the myriad races. Lyn\nSha shook his head, dismissing these\nthoughts, and opened the last treasure\nchest. The epic treasure chest. Open the\nepic chest. You have opened an epic\nchest and obtained an epic special\nequipment. Forest witch's cloak. Click\nto view epic level special equipment.\nLynho&lt;unk&gt;s heart skipped a beat.\nSpecial equipment generally requires\nepic or legendary quality to appear.\nIt's impossible for it to be of low\nquality. Lyn Shao quickly recalled the\ncontents of the knowledge base.\nMoreover, special equipment has unique\nabilities or attributes. Look at the\nstats of this forest witch's cloak. A\nmagnificent crimson cloak floated down\nfrom the sky and landed lightly in Lin\nXiao's hands. Forest witch's cloak.\nSpecial quality orange epic. Attributes.\nBase defense value 365.\nConstitution plus 35. Spirit plus 35.\nSpecial abilities. Invisibility rank A.\nConcealment rank A. Click to view.\nSpecial attribute. Exclusively for\nfemales. Non-female wearers will not\ngain the special ability. Introduction.\nLegend has it that it was made by Alice,\nthe witch of the elf forest. It has an\nelegant appearance and is suitable for\nwomen to wear. Lynsha looked at the\ncloak and couldn't help but sigh. This\nwas a powerful special epic equipment\nwith excellent defense, stamina, and\nspirit attributes. And it also came with\ntwo A- rank skills, invisibility and\nconcealment. This meant that once worn,\nunless the opponent possessed a gold\nlegendary level ability, they would be\nunable to break through it. But what\npuzzled him was the meaning of the\nexclusively for women attribute. He\nlooked at himself, then at Tang Yi\nstanding not far away, that rough, burly\nman whose fists could kill an ox. Tang\nYi sensed the gaze and turned to look at\nLin Shao, revealing a puzzled\nexpression. Lyn Sha turned back\nhelplessly. Forget it. I don't want to\nthink about it anymore. It's probably to\nprevent the Lord from castrating himself\nfor equipment. He stopped thinking about\nit and continued organizing his plans.\nThe Lord's manners still needed 12 hours\nto upgrade and heroes couldn't be\nrecruited until the tavern was\ncompleted. The Hasha token requires\n1,000 battlefield energy to charge,\nwhile Hasha summon has no cool down and\ncan be used as long as you have energy\nand items. Lyn Sha thought, I can\ncontinue to farm monsters to obtain\nenergy and ensure that I can summon\nHasha heroes after the tavern is built.\nHe decided to directly exchange\nbattlefield energy for Hasha token\nenergy. Use 1,000 battlefield energy to\nexchange for one Hasha token energy. Use\nthe Hasha token, Hasha summon to summon\na Huasha exclusive unit. With a flash of\nbright light, the blue recruitment token\nin Linhao's hand instantly transformed\ninto a golden Chinese recruitment token\ndecorated with auspicious clouds and\nfeaturing mythical beast patterns at the\nbottom. With a flick of his hand, a\nportal opened abruptly within the\nterritory and 10 strong figures emerged.\nThe group quickly formed ranks,\ncautiously surveying their surroundings.\n\"Not bad,\" Tanggu praised in a low\nvoice. The leader stopped and after\nreceiving the indoctrination of the main\ngod, he looked up and saw Lin Sha. He\nled the team toward him, took off his\nhelmet, and knelt on one knee. \"Your\nsubordinate,\" Song Ruer greets your\nlordship. \"Get up,\" Lyn Shao said\ncalmly, supporting himself with his\nhand. Song Ruer led his men to their\nfeet, their eyes fixed on the Lord with\ncuriosity and respect. Lyn Sha also\nsized up the newly summoned soldiers.\nThe 10 men were clad in heavy iron\narmor, had burly builds, carried\ncrossbows on their backs, and wielded\nhorizontal swords. They were clearly a\nsquad of archers. \"This archer looks\neven stronger than the iron guards of\nthe Mod Dao. Is he really a ranged\nunit?\" Lyn Shao thought to himself. At\nthis moment, Tangi couldn't help but\nask, \"Sui, are you guys archers?\" \"Yes.\"\nSong Ruer took the huge divine bow off\nhis back and shook it. Isn't it obvious?\nAnd your armor? Tangg Yi pointed to the\nairtight iron armor. Is this infantry\narmor? It weighs 60 gene. Yes, our\nranged units are weak in close combat,\nso we wear this thick armor to protect\nourselves. Song Ruer explained. That\nmakes sense, doesn't it? Chapter 14. The\nstrongest Chinese ranged unit makes its\ndebut. Excellent spirit field. Weak in\nclose combat. You've worn down the hilt\nof your knife. You must have killed\nquite a few people before, right? Tangi\nlooked at the tall and burly Song Ruer\nin front of him, wondering why this\nslender ranged soldier seemed so strong.\nSoon, his gaze locked on his song\nRuer&lt;unk&gt;'s armor, and his eyes lit up.\nA foot soldier weighing 60 gene.\nAlthough it wasn't as shiny as his own\nfish gale armor, it offered much better\nprotection, especially the iron helmet's\nface and neck protection, which Tang Yi\ngreatly envied. Lyn Sha was speechless\nat the sight of the 10 archers in front\nof him. These ranged units, nearly 2 m\ntall, wearing 60-lb armor and carrying\ncrossbows bigger than a person, don't\nlook like proper archers at all. He even\nsuspected that these archers superb\ncrossbows were just for show and that\nwhen the enemy got close, they would\nfind that these ranged units were not\nflustered at all in melee combat and\neven smiled. Lynn Shiao shook his head,\ndeciding to first understand their\ncapabilities. Check the attributes of\nthe divine archer. Divine archer song\nRuer race human\nlevel one quality legend attributes\nstrength 30 + 15 spirit 30 + 15\nconstitution 30 + 15 soul 15 + 7. Combat\nstrength 33 stars. Skills: Eagle Eye,\nrank A, armor penetration, rank A, long\nrange, composure, giant killer, five\nelements, arrow. The divine arm archer\nhas incredibly powerful attributes with\nall three attributes: strength, spirit,\nand constitution fully maxed out. Its\ncombat power rating has reached 33\nstars, even surpassing that of a level\none iron guard with the MO DAO. The\nA-level skills, eagleeye and armor\npenetration, grant the divine archer\nsuperhuman vision and penetration\ncapabilities. In particular, the long\nshot skill allows the divine archer to\nfire accurately at a standard range of\n350 m and a maximum range of 500 m. Lyn\nSha breathed a sigh of relief. It turned\nout that these archers were the real\nranged units. I already know your\ncapabilities. return to the team and\nfight alongside me later. Song Ruer and\nthe others immediately knelt down. Yes,\nLord. Looking at their reverend eyes,\nLin Sha made a judgment. Their loyalty\nwas definitely not low, at least 90%.\nSince that was the case, he intensified\nhis efforts to continue grinding\nmonsters and accumulating battlefield\nenergy. After returning to the Lord's\nManor, Lynn Shiao decided to start\nfarming. He has five spiritual fields of\nexceptional quality. The earlier they\nare planted, the earlier they will be\nharvested, thus solving the problem of\nfood. Spirit fields are of paramount\nimportance to lords, not only increasing\nthe loyalty and happiness of their\nresidents, but also serving as a crucial\nskill in the battle for supremacy among\nall races. Lynsha took out five\nexcellent spirit fields. LinkedIn\nquality excellent output 42,000 units\nmaturity time 48 9.6 hours special\neffect accelerates wound healing and\nincreases resistance to disease in the\nbattlefield of all races. The output and\nmaturity time of spirit fields are\nextremely important. Lynhia's\nexceptional spirit fields not only have\nhigh output but also a particularly\nshort maturity time with the bonus from\nhis SSS level lord talent eternal peace.\nThe output and maturity time of his\nspirit fields are stronger than those of\nlegendary fields. This SSS level talent\nis just too strong. Lyn Sha walked to an\nopen area of his territory, waved his\nhand, and five spirit fields immediately\nappeared in front of him, radiating a\nhazy glow. Cooking time, 9 hours, 35\nminutes, and 59 seconds. Pause. The\nspiritual fields needed farmers to take\ncare of them. So, Lin Shia recalled five\nordinary farmers and two rare farmers.\nThe five of you will be in charge of\nthese spirit fields. Tonight's dinner\ndepends on you. Five ordinary farmers.\nthanked Lin Shia in surprise and began\nto get to work. Several other farmers\nnearby whispered among themselves, \"This\nspirit field feels different. Nonsense.\nThis is an exceptional spiritual field.\"\nThe two rare farmers looked on with\nenvy, hoping that Lyn Sha would assign\nthem tasks. Lyn Sha was in no hurry to\ninvolve rare farmers in farming because\nordinary farmers could also increase the\noutput of the spirit field to 2,000\nunits. While the improvement effect of\nrare farmers was limited, just as he was\nabout to assign tasks, a gruff voice\nsuddenly rang out, \"Enemy attack.\"\nChapter 15. The demonic tide came. The\ndemonic tide gone, \"Enemy attack!\" A Mod\nDao iron guard shouted. Lyn Shao\nimmediately led the Emo Dao iron guards\nand divine arm archers to the warning\nposition. Upon arrival, they saw the\nblack tide turnurning in the distance,\nrapidly advancing towards the Lord's\nmanor fence. The area around the Lord's\nmanor had been cleared by the iron\nguards, and there was no fog. Although\nit was midday, the enemy's figures were\nindistinct in the black fog. Only limbs,\nclaws, and eyes could be seen, exuding\nan eerie and terrifying aura. These are\nnot monsters, but demons. The demonic\ntide is more threatening than the beast\ntide. Demons are more chaotic and\nbloodthirsty than beastmen, orcs, and\ndemons. Lynsha was a little confused.\nDemonic tides usually only occur after\nthe Lord's mansion is upgraded. He had\njust started upgrading, so how could he\nhave encountered a demonic tide? Judging\nfrom the numbers, there are at least\nseveral hundred monsters in the demon\ntide. A guard with a long-handled sword\npatrolled outside the fence. Seeing the\nblack tide approaching, he raised his\nweapon to prepare to fight. With the\nactivation of the pillar of strength\nskill, the attributes of the iron guard\nwith the MO Dao were greatly enhanced.\nHe was ready to defend the Lord's\nmansion to the death. Iron Guards of the\nMod Dao, march out to meet the enemy.\nLyn Shao ordered, \"Divine Armchers,\nprepare to fire.\" Archers were ready and\nSon Ruer immediately said, \"Sir, we can\nsee the enemy clearly now and we can\nopen fire at any time.\" Lyn Sha was\ntaken aback. The archers with the divine\narm bow were still far from the fence\nand the demon tide was several hundred\nmeters away from the fence. How could\nthese archers open fire so quickly? All\nright, Song Rule, you command the\narchers to provide fire support, Lin Sha\nordered. Yes, my lord. bows. And Song\nRui shouted, \"Stretch!\" They stepped on\nthe crossbow heads to tighten the bow\nstrings. Knock the arrows. The archers\nquickly drew their bows, knock the\narrows, and loaded them into their\ncrossbows. Ready, fire! With Song\nRu&lt;unk&gt;s command, 10 giant crossbows\nfired simultaneously, the bolts\naccurately striking the demonic tide.\nThe demonic tide paused for a moment and\nthen 10 hideous corpses rolled out, each\nwith a feathered arrow stuck in its\nhead. Your unit, the archer song Ruer,\nhas killed the swollen drowning one,\ngaining 800 experience, 10 energy, and\n15 gold. Your unit, the archer song\nRome, has killed the swollen drowning\nman and obtained swelling drowners. Lyn\nSha recognized these monsters. They were\nindeed a demonic tide. The swollen\ndrowners are monsters formed from the\nlong-term decay of abandoned corpses.\nThey typically inhabit areas near water\nsources, poisoning creatures or dragging\npassers by into the water to drown. They\nare of rare strength and do not generate\ndemonic mist on their own, but will join\na demonic tide if swept up in it. Lyn\nSha confirmed that this was a demonic\ntide and knew that there must be even\nstronger demons hidden within it. The\ndemonic tide continued to advance\ntowards the Lord's Manor. Lin Shiao,\nTangg Yi, and the others quickened their\npace, preparing to join forces with the\nMo Dao Iron Guards to resist this wave\nof demonic tide. The archers fired a\nsecond volley of arrows. So fast, Lyn\nShao was surprised to see that the\narchers had knocked the bows and fired\nin a volley in just a few seconds. He\nturned his head and saw that the archers\nno longer needed to step on the bow\nstring with their feet, but instead used\none hand to quickly draw the bow, string\nthe bow, and knock the arrow in one\nsmooth motion. In a short time, the\narchers fired 30 arrows and 30 demons\nfell to the ground. When Lin Shiao and\nthe iron guards of the Mod Dao arrived\nat the front of the demonic tide, the\ndemons attack had slowed down and the\nfog had gradually dissipated. With a\nwhoosh, the fog completely dissipated,\nrevealing the remaining monsters who\nseem to be hesitating whether to\ncontinue their attack. But behind them,\nmore than a hundred monsters have\nalready fallen. Archers didn't stop,\nfiring again in unison. With each\nvolley, more monsters fell. Soon only\none isolated giant ghoul remained among\nthe remaining monsters. Giant ghoul\nlevel eight. Quality rare attributes\nstrength 16 spirit 12 constitution 20\nsoul 8 combat strength 15 stars skills\ndemonic mist ghoul eater plague Lin\nShiao and the Modo Dao Iron Guard\nsilently watched the day's giant ghoul\npreparing to receive the final blow. The\narchers quickly knock their bows again.\nYour unit, the archer song Ruer, has\nkilled a giant ghoul, gaining 1,500\nexperience, 30 energy, and 50 gold. As\nthe giant ghoul fell to the ground, its\ncorpse began to gradually dissolve. Lyn\nShiao and the Mod Dao iron guard slowly\nturned around and looked at the iron\nlumps behind them. \"Well done!\" Lyn Shao\nnodded in satisfaction. After returning\nto his territory, Lin Sha instructed the\nrare farmers to retrieve some monitor\nlizard meat from the warehouse, roast\nit, and distribute it to everyone. All\ngathered resources are instantly stored\nin the warehouse, requiring no\ntransportation and suffering no loss.\nRare farmers carry simple tools,\nincluding a barbecue grill. Soon, large\nchunks of monitor lizard meat were\ngrilled, and Lynn Shia called out to\neveryone, \"Come and eat some grilled\nmeat.\" Thank you, Lord. Everyone\nexpressed their gratitude. Although the\nbarbecue was just ordinary food, it\ntasted quite good. Just as Lin Sha and\neveryone were eating the barbecue, the\nsystem interface suddenly flashed and\nChufinga sent a message. Lyn Sha\nChufinga's red hair appeared in the\nchannel. Seeing Lyn Shiao still eating\nbarbecue, she was a little surprised.\nWhy don't you look at the chat channel?\nIt's in an uproar. Chapter 16. Why are\nall my soldiers tough guys? Lynn Shiao\nopened the chat channel and couldn't\nhelp but chuckle as he looked at Xiao\nDaong and Gene Dang as messages. It\nturned out that seeing that they hadn't\nreceived a response, the two of them\nlost face and started spewing threats in\nthe chat channel, constantly spamming\nthe screen. Seeing the two lose their\ncomposure, Lyn Sha didn't take it to\nheart and said to Chufinga, \"They're\njust clowns. No need to pay them any\nmind.\" However, Chufinga's expression\nturned serious. Lyn Sha, things are not\nas you think. I looked into these two\npeople and they're not simple. Lyn Sha\nasked in confusion, \"How do I check? How\ncan I find information about other lords\nin the newbie zone?\" Chufinger\nexplained, \"These two have complicated\nbackgrounds. They bullied classmates for\na long time at school and even committed\na bloody crime which was later\nsuppressed.\" Lyn Sha nodded, indicating\nhis understanding. Most importantly,\nthey have powerful backers, and they are\neven able to connect with the Jang Bay\ncity lords mansion and some forces in\nthe official district. Lyn Sha said\ncalmly. So, they have powerful backers.\nChufinga nodded. Yes, don't worry. I\nknow what I'm doing, Lyn Sha said\ncasually. Thanks for the reminder. I\nhave something to do. I'll hang up now.\nAfter hanging up the communication,\nLynsha quickly led his men to replenish\ntheir energy, preparing to fight\nmonsters and recruit heroes as time was\nof the essence. Are you all full? We're\nfull. The burly men responded in unison,\ntheir voices deafening like thunder.\nGrab your weapons and follow me into\nbattle. Yes. Seeing the reactions of\nthese burly men, Lyn Sha couldn't help\nbut think that most of the other lord's\ntroops were angels. female swordsmen and\nAmazonian female warriors. While he had\nrecruited only these rough men, the\nstyle was a bit off. However, he quickly\nregained his composure and decided to\nfocus on the important matter. I hope my\nfirst hero is a girl. Lyn Sha recalled\nthe nearby map and had an idea. Upgrade\nall Moda iron guards to level six.\nLeader to level seven. Upgrade all\narchers to level five. Boss to level\nsix. He waved his hand and allocated\nmost of the experience points, raising\nthe level of the Modo Dao iron guard to\nlevel six and also raising the level of\nthe divine arm archer. Thank you, my\nlord. The soldiers expressed their\ngratitude in unison, feeling the immense\npower they had gained from the upgrade.\nTanggi, leave behind two Emo Dao iron\nguards. Sun Ruer, leave behind two\ndivine arm archers. The rest of you,\ncome with me on this expedition. Lynn\nShiao set off with two teams of\nlegendary gold tier troops, aiming to\ngrind monsters, accumulate experience,\nand gather battlefield energy. According\nto his memory of the map, he led his\nteam to a monster gathering point. Rock\ngolem level 10, quality rare,\nattributes, strength 20, spirit 10,\nconstitution 26, soul 10, combat power\n20 stars. skills, low tier magic\nimmunity, critical strike. These rock\ngolems are tireless, enormous, and\npowerful, and novice lords usually don't\nprovoke them easily. Lyn Sha waved his\nhand and ordered, \"Kill!\" with divine\ncrossbows quickly launched ranged\nattacks while the iron guards with long\nswords charged forward to engage in\nclose combat. The archer s arrows\nshattered the rock golem almost\ninstantly while the iron guard with the\nlong sword swung his blade with force\neasily killing the enemy. Soon the\nlargest granite golem fell to the\nground. Lyn Shia collected the dropped\nequipment without lingering. Well done.\nKeep it up. Lyn Sha led the team\nforward, sweeping away almost all the\nmonsters they encountered. They killed\nelite level nles, murlocs, and bandits,\ngaining a large amount of experience and\ngold, and also obtained elite and rare\ntreasure chests. Finally, they reached\nthe phantom shooters lair. Through the\narcher's field of vision, Lyn Sha saw\nthe phantom archer inside the nest.\nPhantom shooter level 10, quality\nexcellent attributes: strength 25,\nspirit 30, constitution 18, soul 15.\nCombat power 26 stars. Skills: rapid\nfire, long range sniping. Phantom\narchers are powerful ranged units in the\nearly game. Although their defense is\nrelatively weak, they have a long range,\nhigh accuracy, and strong attack power.\nLyn Sha looked at the 16 muscular men in\nthe group, shook his head slightly, and\nsighed inwardly. This style is really\nfierce. Chapter 17. Subduing the Phantom\nArcher. Dealing with these phantom\nshooters is not difficult at all. The\nammo dao iron guards and divine arm\narchers were both clad in armor weighing\ndozens of kilograms. Legendary level\ntroops wouldn't be easily defeated by\nthese superior level troops. Lyn Shiao\ncould have the Mod Dao iron guards\ncharge in and kill them outright or have\nthe divine arm archers use their long\nrange skill to kite them from 500 m\naway. Moreover, with Xiang Yu&lt;unk&gt;s\nheroic spirit possessing him, he was\nconfident he could charge in and wipe\nthem out completely. But Lyn Xiao's real\npurpose was to subdue these phantom\narchers because this was the phantom\narchers lair in the battlefield of the\nmyriad races. After defeating the guards\nand occupying the nest, a certain number\nof corresponding creatures will spawn\neach week. In other words, after Lyn Sha\noccupies this nest, he can recruit a\ncertain number of phantom archers every\nweek. There should be 35 of these\nphantom archers. Lyn Sha thought to\nhimself after capturing the lair, I can\nrecruit seven more each week. He knew\nhis luck was exceptional. The lord's\nmanner hadn't even finished upgrading\nwhen he encountered the beast tide and\nthe demon tide. If the manor were fully\nupgraded, he might face an even stronger\ndemon tide. More manpower meant more\nstrength. So he decided to try and\nsubdue all 35 phantom archers. Lynn\nShiao ordered, \"Iron guards of the Mod\nDao, archers of the divine arm archer,\nadvance with me and defend against the\narrow attack. Do not retaliate unless I\ngive the order.\" \"Yes, Lord,\" the crowd\nresponded, marching in unison toward the\nphantom archers lair. As soon as they\nentered the attack range, dozens of\narrows came flying through the air,\nheading precisely towards them.\n\"Defend!\" Tang Yi shouted, and the iron\nguards with their swords swung their\nblades to block the arrows, knocking\nthem down one by one. Tanggi then used\nhis body to shield Lynn Shiao from\nseveral arrows. With their superb bows\nducked slightly to avoid arrows hitting\ntheir eyes, allowing the rest of their\nbodies to be struck by the arrows. Their\narmor sparked, yet they remained\nunharmed. Tanggi, witnessing this,\ncouldn't help but think to himself,\n\"Their defenses are too strong.\" After\nseveral volleys of arrows, Lin Shia and\nthe others finally saw the phantom\narchers standing in front of the forest\ncabin in the distance. These tall wood\nelves wore green leather armor, blending\nseamlessly into the forest. Seeing the\niron guards of the Mo Dao and the\narchers of the divine arm archer block\nthe arrows unharmed, the phantom archers\nwere stunned and stopped shooting,\nhesitating. Before they could escape\ninto the woods, Lynn Shiao gently pushed\naside the guards and looked up at the\nphantom archers, saying, \"Stop. We can\ntalk.\" Lin Xiao's frank talent, peace,\ntook effect, reducing the hostility of\nall hostile monsters by 10%. Faced with\na sudden and powerful enemy who did not\ninitiate an attack, the Phantom Archers\nimmediately ceased their assault. The\nfirst step to subjugation, a ceasefire\nachieved. A handsome blonde archer\nstepped forward. Stranger lord, you have\ninvaded our territory. You had better\ngive us a good reason. Lyn Sha glanced\nat him and said softly, I have come to\ninvite you to join my territory, become\nmy people, and fight for me. At the same\ntime, I have come to protect you and\nensure that your people can survive on\nthis cruel battlefield. The Phantom\nArcher leader shook his head. You\nprobably have your eye on our lair and\nwant to recruit Phantom Archers.\nAccording to the rules, you must defeat\nus and take over the lair. Lyn Sha\nslowly stepped out from among the guards\nand walked up to the blonde man, exuding\nan imperial aura. I not only want the\nlair, but I also invite you to join me.\nHow could that be? Before the blonde man\ncould finish speaking, Lynsha\ninterrupted. I know you're obsessed with\narchery. But I have even stronger\narchers here. Don't you want to see\nthem? A stronger archer? The blonde man\nscoffed. In this valley, no one is\nstronger than us phantom archers. Lyn\nSha looked at Song Rule and all the\nphantom archers followed suit, looking\nat the divine archer archers. Song Ruer\nand eight other archers took the giant\ncrossbows from their backs, drew back\nthe bow strings with one hand, loaded\nthe bolts, and prepared to fire. Upon\nseeing this, the Phantom Archers\nimmediately became alert and drew their\nbows again, ready to counterattack. But\nwith a glance from Lin Shao, S Ruer and\nthe others simultaneously pointed their\ngiant crossbows at the sky and pulled\nthe triggers. The arrows whistled out,\ninstantly flying into the air and\ndisappearing into the forest. A few\nseconds later, a giant raven fell from\nthe sky and crashed to the ground, dead\nbeyond any doubt. Eight arrows were\nembedded in its back and wings. The\nphantom archers gasped in astonishment.\nThe arrows striking with incredible\nprecision from above astonished them\nwith their power and skill. Lyn Sha\nnodded to himself. The second step of\nsubjugation demonstrating the power of\nthe same type of troop accomplished. The\ndivine armed bow was far superior to the\nphantom archer, demonstrating an\nabsolute advantage. Meanwhile, somewhere\nin the newbie zone, a handsome young man\nwas rolling on the ground in agony. Ah,\nI didn't see anything, but my contracted\nspirit pet was ambushed. My eyes, my\nhead, my body. It hurts so much. And my\nchrysanthemums. Chapter 18. Recruitment\ntalisman. Necromancer's summoning\nscroll. Luck explodes. Lyn Sha walked up\nto the phantom archers, releasing the\nenergy of Xiang Yu&lt;unk&gt;s Imperial\nSpirit, and his aura suddenly surged.\nThe surrounding air seemed to freeze,\nand the phantom archers stared at him in\nshock. feeling as if the entire world\nwas distorting around him. \"The Golden\nLegend,\" the lead phantom archer\ncouldn't help but exclaim. \"That's\nright. They are all legendary gold tier\nunits, and they are my subordinates,\"\nLyn Sha said slowly. \"Are you willing to\njoin my ranks?\" Soldering, the leader,\nand the other phantom archers knelt on\none knee. \"Soldering and 34 Phantom\narchers are at your command.\" Lyn Sha\nnodded in satisfaction. Good. You will\nbecome my strength. Upgrade. A flash of\nlight appeared and all the phantom\narchers power increased. They stood up\nfilled with fighting spirit. God. Check\nsolderin's attributes. Lynn Sha\ncommanded. Phantom shooter soldering\nlevel 12. Quality excellent. Attributes.\nStrength 27 + 14. Spirit 35 + 18.\nConstitution 19 + 10. Soul 15 plus 7.\nCombat power rating 28 stars. Skills:\nrapid fire, long range sniping. Lynn\nShia nodded in satisfaction. He patted\nSaul the Lin on the shoulder. Get up.\nThe Phantom Archer will become a\nnightmare on the battlefield. Thank you,\nmy lord. Ding. Phantom archer.\nSoldering. Loyalty has reached 70%.\nObedience is key. Lyn Sha was satisfied.\nThe loyalty level had reached 70,\nmeaning these troops had become elite.\nHe led his team to the phantom archers\nlair and gently sent out a wisp of his\nconsciousness to occupy the forest\ncabin. Recruit phantom archers.\nCurrently, there are seven phantom\narchers available for recruitment.\nRecruitment cost 1,600 gold coins per\nperson. Please select the number to\nrecruit. Recruit everyone. Recruiting\nseven phantom archers cost 11,200 gold\ncoins, which made Lin Sha feel a little\npain. The recruitment cost for these\nspecial units was very high, but in\norder to enhance their strength, they\nwere still necessary to recruit them.\nLooking at his eight iron guards with\nlong swords, eight divine archers, and\n42 phantom archers, Lyn Sha was full of\nconfidence. On his first day in the\nnewbie zone, he was ready to sweep\neverything aside. However, Lyn Sha\ndiscovered that although these phantom\narchers were incredibly handsome, they\nwere all male elves. Why are they all\nmen? He silently shook his head,\ndeciding to stop dwelling on it. My\nlord, Tanggi shouted. Who will we fight\nnext? Wait a minute. Let me find where\nthe succubus is. Lin Sha replied\ninstinctively. Huh? Tangg Yui was a\nlittle stunned. Meanwhile, Ziao Daong\nand Jin Dang were also clearing out the\nmonsters. Damn, Lynn Shiao, how dare you\nignore me? Ziao Daong roared angrily as\nhe slashed a goblin to death. When I\nfind you, I will definitely take my\nrevenge. Aa dot. Ziao Daong slashed\nseveral goblins in succession when\nsuddenly a blue light flashed across the\nground. A loot dropped. Ziao Daong was\nsurprised to see the blue item drop and\nquickly ran over to pick it up. It's a\nrare recruitment token, Ziao. Daong\nexclaimed with delight, \"Heaven is\nhelping us.\" Gene Dang also turned his\nhead and saw Xiao Daong pick up the blue\nglowing item, a hint of greed flashing\nin his eyes. \"No way, I got equipment,\ntoo.\" Gene Dang hurriedly ran over and\npicked up another blue item. A scroll of\nnecromancers. Gene Dang exclaimed. Ziao\nDaong also came over. Let me see. Book\nof the Dead. Quality: Blue Rare. Ability\nconsumable when used summons 20 elite\nskeleton archers and 20 elite skeleton\nwarriors all rare units at level 10.\nDuration 24 hours. My god, it really is\na tome of the dead. Ziao Daong exclaimed\nwith ecstasy. With 40 level 10 rare\nunits, I can sweep through the newb\nzone. While Xiao Daong was pleased, he\nsaw Gene Dang also looking smug, which\nmade him furious as he left, thinking,\n\"Why don't I have any luck like him?\"\nXiao Daong continued to hack and slash\nat the goblins, his anger raging when\nsuddenly his sword broke. Click! Ding!\nAs the sword broke, another item glowing\nblue fell from the goblin. \"Damn, I'm so\nlucky.\" Ziao Daong exclaimed. Chapter\n19. My lord, you have saved countless\nmen from the world. Ziao Daang excitedly\nchecked his spoils and discovered he had\nobtained another talisman. Teleportation\nscroll quality rare blue. Description: A\nlower tier alternative to the portal.\nUsable only once, lasting 24 hours.\nAfter obtaining the location, a two-way\nportal to the designated location can be\nopened. Great stuff. This can be used\npersonally, sold, used for escaping, and\neven used to kill people, Xiao. Daong\nsaid excitedly. Gene Dang also revealed\na somewhat insincere smile. Not bad.\nIt's a good thing. We've all had a\npretty good hall today. He even if that\nbrat Lin Sha doesn't sell me the black\nlong sword, I can still become king.\nShiao Daong said smuggly. Even if Lin\nShiao is a ranger lord with 20 star\ncombat power, he's nothing compared to\nour four teams of rare troops and the\nundead. Gene Dang added with a sneer.\nThe two looked at each other for a\nmoment and then fell silent. A few\nseconds later, Ziao Daong spoke up.\nDang, your talent is B-level\npositioning, right? That's right. Gene\nDang smiled coldly. Location accurately\nlocates the position of a lord within\nthe same region whose level difference\nis no more than 10 levels. Can be used\nonce every 24 hours. Has no attack\npower, but is indispensable in faction\nwars. Xiao Datong nodded. Since Lin\nShiao is so weak, yet he possesses\ntreasures. A dangerous glint flashed in\nhis eyes. We even have teleportation\ntalismans and a bounty order, plus the\nability to locate his coordinates. Add\nto that our four rare unit squads and a\nnecronomicanin that can summon 40 undead\nwarriors. Why not just do it directly?\nHe made a throat slitting gesture, his\nintentions clear. It will both seize Lin\nXiao's things and quickly establish our\nauthority. Does Shang, are you in or\nnot? Jin Dang remains silent for a\nmoment before finally making up his\nmind. Let's do it. Fortune favors the\nbold. And what danger is Lin Sha\ncompared to that? I'll go back and\nprepare and bring the harpies with me.\nLet's wipe him out together and let\neveryone in the newbie zone know how\npowerful we are. As darkness fell, Lyn\nSha unleashed a powerful strike,\npiercing through the head of a demonic\ncreature resembling a seductive woman\nwith his spear. The creature let out a\nsharp scream and exploded into pieces.\nYour lordship is mighty. The iron guards\nbehind him, seeing Lin Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s heroic\nfigure, all shouted. The long-eared elf\nsaw the Lin was also shocked and he was\nglad that he had joined Linhao's side.\nThe Lord is so powerful. He easily dealt\nwith our phantom archers all by himself.\nIt seems my choice was right. With a\nflash of purple light, the female demon\ndropped a purple superior treasure\nchest. Another treasure chest. It seems\nthe main god wants me to open more blind\nboxes. Lyn Sha picked up the treasure\nchest and the flashing lights stored it\nin the system warehouse. The monsters\nhad been wiped out. Lyn Shao turned\naround and saw a group of admiring\ngazes. Lord, you are mighty. Tang Yu was\nthe first to step forward, kneeling on\none knee and clasping his hands and\ngreeting. Lord, you are handsome and\nelegant, concerned for the world and\ndedicated to eliminating demons and\nprotecting the righteous. You are truly\na holy ruler. Son Rueer also arrived,\nlifted his mask, knelt down, and clasped\nhis hands. Lord, you are a man of great\nstature and extraordinary strength. You\nare devoted to eliminating evil for the\ncommon people and saving countless men.\nYour merits are immeasurable. Soldering\nstood there dumbfounded. Even a\nlegendary golden unit was flattering the\nLord. Did the Lord have such a pinchant\nfor it? Lyn Xiao&lt;unk&gt;so's lips twitched\nslightly as he watched the two burly\nmen's performance, feeling utterly\nhelpless. \"What does it mean to be\nconcerned about the world and to\neliminate demons and protect the\nrighteous path? What does it mean to\nsave countless men in the world?\" he\nasked casually. \"Exactly,\" Tanggi\nimmediately explained. \"The Lord has\nbeen frowning from the very beginning,\nknowing that there are female demons\ncausing trouble, and he is worried. So,\nhe brought us here to wipe them out.\"\nSong Ruer continued, \"These female\ndemons appear charming on the surface,\nbut are actually hideous and devour\nmen's essence. Fortunately, Lord, you\nsaw through their tricks at a glance.\nWithout the Lord, how could an ordinary\nman withstand these alluring demons?\"\nTang Yi chimed in, \"Lord, you risked\nyour life to eliminate this threat for\nthe sake of all men. Your merit is truly\nimmeasurable. Your excellency has truly\ndone a great deed.\" The crowd shouted in\nunison. Soldering&lt;unk&gt;s eyes widened and\nhe suddenly realized that he had wronged\nLyn Sha and his heart was filled with\nrespect for him. Lyn Sha looked at the\nscene before him, his head throbbing\nwith pain. He was only thinking about\nbalancing the number of male soldiers,\nbut he accidentally led everyone to\nclear out this group of demons. He never\nexpected that Tang Yi and Song Ruer\nwould misunderstand him as a noble lord\nwho was eliminating evil for all men.\nFeeling the admiring gazes of Tang Yi\nand Song Ruer, Lin Shao sighed softly\nand said calmly, \"I am very gratified\nthat you can understand my good\nintentions.\" Just then, a system\nnotification sounded bite. Phantom\narcher soldering loyalty has reached 80.\nAs easy as using and limb chapter 20,\nWhite Stocking Lolita and school uniform\nboy with dark circles. Upon hearing the\nprompt from the main god, Lin Sha\nsuppressed the twitching at the corner\nof his mouth and thought to himself.\nThis actually works. Fortunately, Tang\nYi and Song Ruer were there to support\nhim. But the style of this situation was\ngetting weirder and weirder. He looked\naround at the 2 m tall muscular man who\nwas playing the straight man and\nSolderlands admiring gaze. Wait a\nminute, Selin. What's with that look in\nyour eyes? Lynn Shiao quickly shook his\nhead, dispelling these wild thoughts.\nIt's getting late. Everyone go back to\nthe territory. Nighttime is extremely\ndangerous on the battlefield of the\nmyriad races. Except in areas controlled\nby lords, most wild monsters become\nstronger at night, and powerful demonic\ncreatures appear frequently. Lyn Sha\nknew that nighttime was the domain of\nwild monsters, and lords would return to\ntheir territories in advance to avoid\ndanger. He suspected that this situation\nwas a setting made by the main god\nsystem to repair or manipulate certain\nmechanisms. Coupled with his strange\nluck, Lyn Sha worried that he might\nencounter something even more terrifying\nthat night. But now that you've killed\nenough monsters, collected enough gold,\nexperience, and energy, and recruited 42\nexceptional phantom archers, the mission\nis complete. It's time to go back and\nopen treasure chests, build a tavern,\nand recruit heroes. So Lyn Sha led his\nmen toward the Lord's mansion. The\nwarriors in the group were full of\nfighting spirit, and as they moved\nforward, the monsters around them\nscreamed in agony. Meanwhile, not far\nfrom Liao's territory, some novice lords\nwere preparing to launch a final attack\nbefore nightfall. A petite Lolita style\ngirl dressed in a Lolita dress and white\nstockings with small animal ears on her\nhead has an innocent and sweet\nappearance. Yet her figure is striking.\nShe is leading a group of we werewolves\nin a fierce attack on a wild monster\nguarding a stone mine. Go big dog, go.\nThe little girl waved her small hands\nwhich were wearing animal claw gloves to\ncheer on her werewolves. Encouraged, the\nwerewolf captain's eyes turned\nbloodshot. He leaped up and killed the\nmonster with a single punch, and the\nother werewolves fought back fiercely.\nThen, seeing the werewolves display\ntheir skills, the little girl jumped and\ncheered. Her body swaying with\nexcitement, making the werewolf captain\nblush. I got some good stuff again. The\ndrop rate in the battlefield of 10,000\nraces is really high. The little girl\njumped up and down happily and\nimmediately picked up the equipment that\nwas flashing green light. She muttered\nto herself. Beauty really can put food\non the table, although I am only\nslightly attractive. Even the\nbattlefield of the myriad races is\nfavoring me. Not far away, a boy in a\nschool uniform had just put down his bow\nand arrow. He had a handsome face.\nAlthough two heavy dark circles under\nhis eyes marred his good looks. Even\nthough they're just ordinary monsters,\nit's really unusual to encounter so many\nmonsters in the beginner area, he\nmuttered to himself. A female creature\ndraped in green leaves with a slender\nfigure and transparent elven wings\nfloated over and bowed to him. My lord,\nthe demon child has finished cleaning up\nand dropped a blue item. Please come and\ntake a look. Upon seeing such a\nbeautiful woman, the school unifored\nno evil intentions and gently replied,\n\"I understand. I'll be right there.\" He\npicked up the demon child's blue item, a\nsmile spreading across his face. \"Great.\nIt's a rare spirit field.\" \"Haha, I've\nbeen so lucky since I stopped arguing\nwith those two fat guys.\" He excitedly\nheld up the spirit field and said, \"With\nthis rare spirit field, I can finally\nfeed my people.\" Upon hearing his voice,\na group of female creatures gathered\nbehind him. They were slender and had\nalluring faces. Seeing their lord so\nhappy, they all smiled with delight.\nReally? That's wonderful. Your highness\nis amazing. Long live the lord. We can\nfinally eat our fill. The women flew\nover and surrounded Heay, all offering\nhim sweet smiles. My lord, you are truly\ngreat. Thank you, my lord. Lord, could\nyou please draw some luck from Yao Yao?\nHeay hurriedly pushed them away. Stop.\nStop. Stop. Can't you see it's getting\ndark? Stop fooling around. Let's go back\nfarm and have a good meal. They cheered.\nGreat. We&lt;unk&gt;ll lead the lord back.\nHeay shook his head and smiled, then\nflew back to his territory, surrounded\nby others. At this moment, Lyn Sha\nfinally led his team back to the\nLord&lt;unk&gt;'s manor before nightfall. Few,\nit feels so good to be home. Lyn Sha\nbreathed a sigh of relief. Now that I\ncan't kill monsters, I should go back\nand replenish my energy, farm, build a\ntavern, and recruit heroes. He looked at\nthe exceptional spirit field, which was\nnearing maturity. Inspect the spirit\nfield. The system pops up the spirit\nfield attribute window. LinkedIn quality\nexcellent output 42,000 units. Ripening\ntime 1 hour 37 minutes and 36 seconds.\nSpecial effects accelerates wound\nhealing and enhances resistance to\ndisease. Lyn Sha calculated it will take\nanother hour to mature. No problem. He\ncalled over three rare farmers and asked\nthem to grill the barbarian beef. These\nwild bulls were monsters Lynn Shiao\nencountered while exterminating the\nblack death demoness. Although they were\ntroublesome, they could now be used as\nfood. Once the meat was cooked, the\nspirit fields would also be ready,\nsolving the territo's food problem.\nNext, we need to take stock of our\nachievements and prepare for future\ndevelopments. God system. View all my\ncurrent resources. Chapter 21 A.\nBountiful harvest. Awaiting the heroes\nreports. Lynn Shiao checked the resource\npanel and nodded in satisfaction.\nExperience 1,354,300\ncan be used to upgrade troops, heroes,\nlords, and special buildings. Gold\n12,950.\nRecruiting phantom archers cost a lot\nand the money-making speed is slow.\nTreasure chests, one excellent treasure\nchest, two rare treasure chests, two\nsuperior treasure chests. items. Green\nleader charm X1 purple defense charm X1.\nOther items: Mini tavern X1 scaled rock\nbreastplate X1. Scaled rock shoulder\npads X1. Black long sword X1. Currently\non auction claw of attack X1 life amulet\nX1. Special battlefield energy of all\nraces X3 300. Resources: Wood, X9, 740,\nStone, X8, 550, iron or X4, 700, copper\nor X4, 700, silver or X2, 350, refined\niron, X1, 561, refined copper X1, 734,\ngold or X100, sulfur X100. A very\nfruitful harvest, Lyn Sha thought to\nhimself with satisfaction. Although the\nmonster killing was a bit slower than\nexpected, the overall speed was still\nvery fast, far exceeding that of the\naverage beginner. Peace for all ages is\ntruly powerful. The battle over the past\nfew hours yielded Lynn Shia a\nconsiderable amount of treasure chests\nand equipment. First, he acquired a\ngreen quality leader token, allowing him\nto recruit 10 excellent quality farmers.\nLyn Sha gave them some lava giant lizard\nmeat to cook themselves and then sent\nthem to chop wood and mine. The purple\ndefense talisman is a one-time\nprotective talisman that can create a\nlight shield within the territory,\nblocking 10,000 points of damage for 1\nhour, making it very suitable for\ndefending against surprise attacks.\nNext, he inspected several new pieces of\nequipment. Attack claw quality rare\nblue. Attribute attack power 220.\nSuitable for lords who need high burst\ndamage such as assassin type heroes.\nLife amulet quality purple excellent.\nAttribute stamina plus 30 increases\nwound healing and physical recovery\nspeed. This equipment is equivalent to\nincreasing the survivability of an\naverage novice lord by three to four\ntimes, making it a life-saving artifact.\nAttack claws are suitable for heroes\nwith high burst damage, while life\namulet can improve survivability and is\nmore popular than attack claws. Lynsha\nput down the equipment and began opening\nthe treasure chest. One fine chest, two\nrare chests, and two superior chests.\nOpen them all. He quickly opened the\nfive treasure chests. Excellent treasure\nchest contains 200 gold ore. Rare\ntreasure chest. Obtain a deadly bow.\nRare treasure chest. Obtain wall\nconstruction blueprints. Excellent\ntreasure chest. Obtain one piece of\nscale rock leggings. Excellent treasure\nchest. Obtain the snow dance katana. Lyn\nSha was stunned for a moment, not\nexpecting to be so lucky. The first\nexcellent treasure chest was like a\nwarm-up, and the following chest\nsuccessfively yielded equipment and a\ncity defense building blueprint. In\nparticular, the scale rock leggings\ncompleted his existing scale rock set\nthree-fifths, greatly increasing his\ndefensive capabilities. Scale rock\nleggings set three-fifths. Quality\npurple excellent. Attributes base\ndefense 150, strength plus 10, stamina\nplus 10. Set bonus scale rock heavy\narmor set 3 fifths plus 15 strength plus\n15 stamina. a very significant attribute\nbonus. Lyn Sha then examined the deadly\nbow. Killer bow quality rare blue\nattributes attack power 180, agility\nplus 10. Special attribute increases\ncritical hit chance by 10%. This bow is\nperfect for heroes with high accuracy\nand critical hit rate, especially ranged\nunits like the divine archer. Finally,\nthere was that beautiful katana dance of\nfine snow. Quality purple. Excellent\nattributes. Attack power 280, strength +\n15, agility + 15. This katana is both\nbeautiful and powerful. It's a perfect\nlegendary weapon. Lynn Shiao decided to\nkeep it and distribute it after the\nfirst hero arrives. \"This knife is much\nstronger than the black long sword.\nPerhaps my first hero will be a\nswordsman, so I'll give it to him,\" Lyn\nSha thought. Looking at all this\nequipment, he was very satisfied. On his\nvery first day in the newbie zone, he\nhad already acquired so many good items.\nWhich hero will I recruit? Lyn Sha\nlooked up at the dark knight sky. Could\nwe get a beautiful hero this time? Di\nWong Xiao Jun Xiao Chan Diao Xiao Xiao.\nAnything is fine. I'm not picky. He\nchuckled self-deprecatingly,\nbut these female heroes don't seem to\nhave much fighting ability. Next, he\nchecked the progress of the Lord's Manor\nand confirmed that there were still a\nfew hours left before the upgrade was\ncompleted. Expected to be finished at\n11:55 p.m. Level myself up a few times\nfirst. We can't just focus on upgrading\nthe honks. Lynn Shia waved his hand with\na smile and seven colored light\nimmediately rose in the Lord's Mansion.\nChapter 22. The founding emperor's staff\ntechniques. Continuing the lost skills\nof the sages. A flash of light spread\nthroughout the lord's manor, but not a\nsingle ray escaped. After a day of\nintense battles and accumulating a\nwealth of experience, Lyn Sha, with the\nhelp of 20 legendary gold units and 42\nsuperior units, successfully reached\nlevel 10. His experience was almost\ndepleted, but he didn't stop striving to\nbecome stronger. As stated in the theory\nof lords, a powerful lord does not\nnecessarily possess great marshall\nprowess, but one who possesses great\nmarshall prowess is certainly a powerful\nlord. Lyn Shia himself possesses great\nmarshall prowess and would never give up\non improving it because of his cheat\nability and handsome appearance. As the\nafterglow faded, Lyn Sha closed his\neyes, sensing the fluctuations of power\nwithin his body. I've become stronger.\nHe opened his eyes. a cold light\nflashing within them like a sharp sword\npiercing through the clouds. Lynn Sha\nretrieved a rare spear from his system\nspace, jumped into the courtyard in\nfront of the Lord's mansion and began\npracticing his spear techniques. The\nsound of spears cutting through the air\nfilled the air as the spear danced in\nhis hands, creating a dense and\nimpenetrable display of spear flowers.\nTangg Yi, S Ruer, and Saul Lin were\nchatting when they saw Lin Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s\nmartial arts demonstration and stopped\ntalking, drawn to it. Excellent.\nExcellent, Lord. Although I don't\nunderstand your marksmanship, it seems\ninvincible combining offense and\ndefense, Tanggi exclaimed. Simply\nsmashing it with a gun can demonstrate\nsuch power, Song Rui added. Tangg Yi and\nSong Rui both sensed that Lin Shao was\nnot using traditional spear techniques,\nbut rather a unique skill that\nincorporated stick techniques. At that\nmoment, Song Ruer suddenly understood\nand blurted out, \"It's the great\nancestor. It's the Pamlong staff\ntechnique.\" He explained, \"This is the\nPanlong staff technique created by\nEmperor Taou of Song. He once conquered\nthe world with just a staff. This staff\ntechnique is incredibly powerful and can\nbe considered a top tier martial art.\nTangg Yu was completely confused. So Son\nRueer continued to explain this set of\nstaff techniques has been lost to time\nand many people only know some fragments\nof it. Today we actually saw the Lord\ndemonstrate the complete technique.\nLord, you must be a true descendant of\nthe Chinese people. To have acquired\nthis skill is truly an incredible stroke\nof luck. Song Ruer exclaimed excitedly.\nMoved by their actions, Seong Ruer and\nthe other archers picked up their ring\npommel swords and began practicing with\nLin Sha, using them as clubs. Tangg Yi\nand the others, not to be outdone,\njoined in with their long-handled\nswords, and the courtyard was instantly\nfilled with the glint of blades and the\nlively atmosphere. After Lin Shao\nfinished practicing a set of panlong\nstaff techniques, he stopped, looked\naround, and saw two neatly standing\nsquads of soldiers. The Mod Dao iron\nguards and the divine arm archers. Ding!\nYour unit, the divine archer song Rueer,\nhas reached 100% loyalty. Ready to go\nthrough fire and water. Ding! Your unit,\nthe divine archer, has reached 100%\nloyalty. Go through fire and water.\nDing! You have triggered the eternal\npeace, inheriting the lost skills of the\nsages, talent skill, and will be taught\nthe skill coiled dragon staff technique.\nLyn Sha nodded in satisfaction. His team\nmembers had improved through the\npractice. The systems notification made\nhim realize that he had not only fully\nmastered the panong staff technique\nthrough his martial arts practice, but\nhad also passed it on to 20 trusted\nsubordinates through his innate skills,\nenhancing their strength. Lin Shao\npondered this in his mind, checking the\nattributes of Tang Yi and Song Ruer, the\nIron Guard of the Mod Dao, Tang Yi.\nRace: human, Hasha. Level seven. Quality\nlegend. Attributes: Strength 83 + 42.\nSpirit 39 + 19, Constitution 72 + 36,\nsoul 34 + 12. Combat power rating 68\nstars. Skills: Divine Valor, Pillar of\nStrength, Bloodlust, Slash with the\nMomentum, Slash Against the Momentum,\nDragon Staff, Beginner, Divine Archer,\nSong Rue. Race: Human Hashia Level six.\nQuality: Legend. Attributes: Strength 65\n+ 33. Spirit 65 + 33. Constitution 55 +\n28. Soul 35 + 18. Combat power rating 63\nstars. Skills eagle eye rank A. Armor\npenetration rank A. Long shot composure\ngiant killer five elements arrow. Dragon\nstaff technique beginner. Looking at the\ntwo units attributes, Lin Shiao smiled\nwith satisfaction. Golden legendary\nunits are indeed powerful. The attribute\nincrease per level far exceeds that of\nother units. Song Ruer and Tang Ye gain\nfive points to their main attribute,\n3.75 points to their secondary\nattribute, and two points to their third\nattribute with each level up. It's\nterrifying. Their growth potential is\nunmatched by other troop types, he\nexclaimed. What's even more terrifying\nis that after learning the Panlong\nstaff, their four-dimensional attributes\nincreased by 10. S Rui&lt;unk&gt;'s attributes\nare now far superior to those of a level\n12 Solin. Lyn Sha pondered while feeling\ngratified. The growth potential of the\ngolden legendary troops is indeed\nstrong, especially since they start from\na high level and can completely surpass\nme in the future. But these Chinese\nsoldiers are 100% loyal and completely\nsubservient to me. Lyn Sha thought to\nhimself, \"The Lord is the ultimate\nwinner. There's no need to rush. Time to\ncheck my own attributes.\" The god system\npanel popped up and Lyn Sha was shocked\nto see his personal attributes. Lyn Sha\nlevel 10 attributes. Strength 67 + 250\nspirit 68 + 100 constitution 45 + 200\nsoul 45 + 110 skills unrestricted mixed\nmartial arts dank all weapon mastery d\nrank farming c rank panlong staff\ntechnique a rank lifting the tripod\nfeathered courage breaking the boat and\nsinking the ship overlord spear command\na rank combat Power rating 64 stars.\nLord's talent. Peace for all ages. Click\nto view. Chapter 23. Recruiting the\nfirst hero. To Lynhiao's astonishment.\nHis own attributes were also incredibly\nstrong. Based on my initial attribute\npoints, I've achieved a terrifying stat\nline. Plus five points to two main\nattributes and plus three points to two\nsecondary attributes for every level up.\nAlthough my initial attributes aren't as\ngood as legendary units, my growth\npotential surpasses them. I also have\nthe scale rock set. Even without the\neternal emperor's heroic spirit\npossessing me, my attributes are still\nenough to go head-to-head with Tang Yi\nand Song Rui. Lyn Shia was only slightly\namazed by the strength of his own\nattributes. As a lord, anything is\npossible. After opening the treasure\nchests and participating in the martial\narts practice, it was about time. Lyn\nSha went into the courtyard where he\nheard the farmers heho heho sounds. My\nlord, a farmer bowed and said, the meat\nis ready. Lyn Sha nodded gently and\nsaid, carry the meat to the center of\nthe yard. Call everyone, including the\nbrothers who work hard in the mining\narea, and let's eat together. Yes, my\nlord. The farmer who was roasting meat\nleft deeply moved. He had never\nencountered a lord who treated farmers\nso well. Other lords only care that the\npeasants don't starve to death, and they\nprovide the worst food. Sometimes the\npeasants even have to sneak out to\ngather wild vegetables themselves.\nBefore long, apart from a few warriors\npatrolling and guarding the territory\nfence, all the Mo Dao iron guards,\ndivine arm archers, phantom archers, and\nfarmers came to the center of the\ncourtyard. Several farmers also brought\nover cooked spirit rice porridge. Just\nhalf an hour ago, Lyn Ziao's five\nexcellent spirit fields had also\nmatured, and the first batch of spirit\nrice had successfully entered the\nwarehouse. 10,000 units of spirit rice\nwere enough for the people in the\nterritory to eat for more than a week.\nThe second batch of Lingi has begun to\nbe planted and will be ripe by tomorrow\nmorning. There is 100% enough food. The\naroma of roasted meat and the fragrance\nof rice porridge wafted through the air,\nstimulating everyone's taste buds, and\nsome people's stomachs even rumbled.\nEnough with the nonsense. Now that\nyou've become my subjects, Lyn Sha, just\ndo your job well and I'll take care of\nthe rest. Lyn Sha didn't waste any more\nwords and told everyone to get started.\nTalk is cheap. Action speaks louder than\nwords. He's not one of those famous\nbosses on Earth from my previous life\nwho only knew how to use empty words to\nmanipulate their subordinates. Those who\nonly think about making more money are\nno different from the Walking Dead.\nMoney shouldn't be a college student's\ndream. You have to pay tuition to study\nat school, but you can learn things by\nworking here without paying tuition. So,\nwhat if the salary is lower? Young\npeople shouldn't always think about\nmaking money. They should be willing to\nendure hardship and learn new skills.\nThat's what truly matters. Lyn Sha shook\nhis head, trying to dispel his wandering\nthoughts. He squeezed into the crowd and\nsat around the barbecue grill with the\nsoldiers and farmers of the territory.\nHe tore off a piece of barbarian beef,\npicked up a bowl of steaming spirit rice\nporridge, and began to eat heartily\nwhile chatting with the people next to\nhim. Lynhia's approachable actions\ntouched everyone in the territory. This\nlord was not only handsome and imposing,\npossessing superb marshall prowess and\npowerful skills, and commanding a fierce\nand ruthless army, but he also treated\nhis people like brothers, being\napproachable and kind without\ndistinction of rank. These people who\nhad long been indoctrinated with\ncivility in another world and had\nwitnessed countless tragic fates not be\nmoved. Ding. The loyalty of farmer Zu E\nin your territory has reached 100. Ready\nto go through fire and water. Ding. Your\nunit phantom archer soldering has\nreached a loyalty level of 90. Obedient\nto all commands. The system\nnotifications kept coming. After Lin Sha\nfinished his meal, the loyalty of all\nthe farmers in his territory reached\n100. And even the phantom archers, who\nhad only joined less than half a day\nago, had a loyalty of 90. It can be said\nthat the cohesion within the territory\nis at an unprecedented high. After\neating and drinking his fill, it was\nalready late at night. Lyn Sha glanced\nat the upgrade progress of his lord's\nmanor. Lord's mansion under upgrade.\nUpgrade countdown. 29 minutes and 36\nseconds. Click the pause. I almost\nforgot. Now is the perfect time to use\nit. Seeing that the Lord's Manor was\nabout to be upgraded, Lyn Sha remembered\nthat there was one more thing he hadn't\nused. That's the city defense building\nwall that I just got from the treasure\nchest. This is a fairly common item.\nAfter use, it can upgrade the wooden\nfence of your territory into a wall. A\nwall is much better than a wooden fence.\nThe walls are higher and wider with\ngreater defensive capabilities. Highle\nwalls are even city walls where people\nand horses can walk and ride, making\nthem impenetrable to ordinary monsters.\nUse the item to construct a defensive\nstructure, the wall. As soon as Lynn Sha\nfinished speaking, the wooden fence\nsurrounding the entire territory, which\nwas shimmering with golden light, was\nimmediately covered by a burst of white\nlight. Construction of the wall has\nbegun. Wall under construction.\nConstruction countdown 29 minutes and 59\nseconds. Click to pause. The wall is a\nvery simple defensive structure, not a\ncore building with a pivotal role like\nthe Lord's mansion. Moreover, it was\nconverted from a wooden fence, so it can\nbe built very quickly in just 1 hour.\nLyn Sha with his innate talent directly\nreduced construction time by 50% and the\nwall could be completed in half an hour.\nThe timing is perfect. Lyn Sha did not\nforget to upgrade the walls as soon as\npossible to obtain higher defense, but\nrather wanted to complete the upgrade of\nthe walls and the upgrade of the Lord's\nmansion in the same time period. Because\nhe suspected that every action he took\nin his territory would attract beast\ntides or demon tides, he couldn't let\nsuch a small matter as upgrading the\nwalls affect the important matter of\nupgrading the Lord's Manor. Half an hour\nlater, as the light faded, Lyn Xiao's\nLord's Mansion successfully completed\nits upgrade, transforming from a level\nzero Lord's Mansion at the start to a\nlevel one Lord's Mansion. Lord's Mansion\nlevel level one quality legendary\ndefense 5,000 + 5,000 attributes\nspiritual energy revival luck revival\nabundance power healing thorn fence\nspecial building rainbow pool click to\nview capacity 10,000. As the Lord's\nupgrade is completed, the wooden fence\nexpands outward, further increasing the\nterrito's area. As it is a legendary\nlord's mansion, the territory area has\nbeen directly expanded to 50,000 square\nm, making the few buildings in the\nentire territory appear lonely. The next\nmoment, the wall was also upgraded. In\nthe light, the wooden fence transformed\ninto a sturdy wall 3 m high and nearly 1\nmeter thick, enclosing the entire\nterritory. The wall quality average\ndefense 1,000 at 1,000. The wall is of\nordinary quality, so it only has 1,000\ndefense points, which is even less than\nthe legendary quality wooden fence with\n2,000 defense points. Fortunately, the\nwalls are counted as separate defenses,\nand the 5,000 points of defense from the\npreviously rumored wooden fence around\nthe Lord's Mansion are still retained.\nAfter completing the Lord's mansion and\nsurrounding walls, Lynn Sha worked\ntirelessly. He has already met two of\nthe three conditions for recruiting\nheroes. The third condition is that he\nuses a mini tavern, which can be\ncompleted in an instant. Use the mini\ntavern item to build a tavern within\nyour territory. As soon as he finished\nspeaking, the one colon 200 scale\nminiature tavern in Lin Xiao's hand\ndisappeared in the light. In just a few\nseconds, an identical tavern building\nappeared in the territory. The tavern is\nnow complete. The conditions for\nrecruiting heroes have been met. And\nright now, it's only the first day of\nthe opening of the 89,757\nnewbie zone of the Battle of 10,000\nraces. At 11:55 p.m., Lyn Shia is about\nto make history. At this moment, Lynn\nShiao didn't care whether he was\nexpecting a female general or an empress\nto appear and directly said, \"Exchange\nfor Hasha token energy. Consume one\nenergy point to use the Hasha token.\nHasha summoning function to summon a\nHasha hero.\" A flash of seven colored\nlight appeared and a portal appeared in\nthe territory. The notification sound\nfrom the main god system came through.\nCongratulations on obtaining the Chinese\nhero Sword St. Payman. Chapter 24. Sword\nSaint Payman. Sword St. Pman. As the\nvoice of the main god system faded, a\nfigure emerged from the portal. This is\na man dressed in ancient Chinese attire.\nHe is wearing a pure white brocade robe\nwith a tiger pattern gold belt around\nhis waist. He has long, neat hair tied\nback. Below his eyebrows are bright eyes\nand he has a slender figure. He is truly\na man of extraordinary talent and\nelegance. The man had a three-ft long\nsword hanging diagonally at his waist.\nAlthough he was young, his expression\nrevealed a hint of vicissitude, and\nevery move he made was that of a\nswordsman. He stepped out of the portal,\ncasually glanced around, and looked\nrelaxed and indifferent, seemingly not\nat all puzzled by being in an unfamiliar\nplace. At this moment, the god system\nbegan to instill information into the\nman. The man tilted his head and\nreceived all the information in a\nmoment. So, it's another world, a\nbattlefield with endless wars and\ncountless worlds and races. Very well,\nthis will allow me to hone my\nswordsmanship and pursue a higher level.\nAfter muttering a few words to himself,\nthe man turned his head and looked at\nthe lord Lin Sha, who was surrounded by\ndozens of emo dao iron guards and divine\narm archers standing in front of him.\nLyn Sha also stared silently at the man\nin ancient costume not far away. Heroes\nlike knights errant, swordsmen, and\nchivalous thieves are unruly and more\npowerful in combat, but they are often\ntoo unrestrained and have lower loyalty\nthan other heroes, requiring more\nmaintenance of the relationship between\nlord and hero. Lynn Shiao recalled the\nrelevant knowledge of the paper on the\nmanagement of male heroes and the taming\nof female heroes mistaken and\ninvoluntarily connected it with the\nsword saint and knight in front of him.\nIn his previous life, Lyn Shao had\nvaguely heard of the name Pay Min. He\nonly knew that Pay Min was one of the\nthree perfections of the Tang Dynasty.\nPay Min sword dance was as famous as Lee\nBa's poetry and Jang Su&lt;unk&gt;s cursive\nscript. He had been awarded a title by\nthe emperor of the time which showed his\nstrength. But chivalry can break the law\nwith martial arts. The more powerful the\nchivalous hero, the more unrestrained\nand free they are. You are my lord. At\nthis moment, Pay Min spoke, his voice\ngentle and refined yet seemingly casual.\nLooking at the carefree man before him,\nLyn Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s serious face slowly\nrelaxed, and he gave Pay Min a kind\nsmile. Exactly. Welcome, young swordsman\nfrom China. Welcome to be my subject, my\nfirst hero. Payman saw Linn Sha admit\nthat he was the lord. He paused for two\nseconds and stared straight at the tall\nyoung man in front of him. He stopped\nhis nonchalon attitude and quickly\nstepped forward, knelt on one knee, and\nbowed in greeting. I am Pay Min, the\n31st generation descendant of the Pi\nfamily of Hadong. I pay my respects to\nthe Lord and am willing to serve you.\nLynn Sha, who had already mentally\nprepared himself, stood there\ndumbfounded. This swordsman isn't as\narrogant as I imagined. Please rise, Mr.\nPay Min. Lyn Sha reached out to help\nhim. I dare not address you as sir. You\nflatter me. My lord, you may simply call\nme by my name, Pay Min. Pay Min stood\nup. He looked at his lord, Lin Sha, and\nhis casual and chivalous aura\ndisappeared, replaced by a more\nrespectful one. Lin Shao also silently\nwatched Pay Min thinking to himself,\n\"Check Pay Min's personal attributes.\"\nThe main god system immediately\ndisplayed Pay Min's attributes. Sword\nSaint Pay Min\nChinese quality golden legend level one.\nAttributes: Strength 58 + 29. Spirit 63\n+ 32. Constitution 55 + 28. Soul 55 +\n28. Skills: Sacrifice to break through\nillusions Srank. Sword mastery Srank.\nSword of all things. A sword from the\neast. Sword dance. Sword aura. A rank.\nUltimate path. Lord of 10,000 swords.\nExclusive unit type: Chinese Ranger.\nCombat power rating 61 stars. Lin Sha\nnodded, thinking to himself. This is a\nhero, a legendary hero of China's golden\nage. Comes with an S-rank skill and\nboasts a combat power rating of 60 stars\nfrom the start. This is the most\npromising unit in my territory. It's a\npity we don't have any experience points\nleft. Otherwise, I could upgrade him\nimmediately. At level two, he would\ndefinitely be stronger than Tang Yi and\nSong Ruer, who are both at level seven.\nLyn Shao had already used most of his\nexperience points to level up, raising\nhimself to level 10 in one go. After\nreaching level 10, the experience points\nrequired for level 11 even exceeded the\ntotal of the previous 10 levels.\nMoreover, Lyn Sha possessed the spirit\nof a Chinese emperor who could protect\nhim probably. But Lyn Sha wasn't sure if\nit was always a top expert like Xiang\nYu. Lyn Sha will not upgrade himself in\nthe short term. So, he will focus on\nupgrading his subordinates. Pay Min, who\nis 61 stars at level one and has\nunprecedentedly powerful attributes, is\na hero unit and will definitely be a key\ntarget for development. Thinking of\nthis, Lynn Sha reached out and gently\npatted the sword saints shoulder,\nsaying, \"Hey, Min, since we're here,\nlet's make the best of it. Now that\nwe're in this strange world, are you\nwilling to follow me to achieve great\nthings and live up to the name of\nchivalry?\" Pay Min smiled faintly and\nsaid,\"Lord, you are protected by the Emo\nDao soldiers of our great Tang dynasty,\nand you are the rightful heir of the Lee\nfamily, the emperor of the Tang Dynasty.\nAlthough you have a chivalous spirit,\nyou were also a soldier in your previous\nlife, serving as a general in our great\nTang dynasty.\" Pay Min knelt down on one\nknee again and bowed, saying, \"Isn't it\nonly natural for a young man to serve as\nLord? I, Pay Min, am willing to serve\nyou like a dog or a horse. Ding! Your\nhero, Sword Saint Payman, has reached\n80% loyalty, as easy as a fingertip. The\nsystem notification sounded at just the\nright moment. \"Good, good, please rise.\"\nLyn Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s doubts were finally\nresolved. It turned out that Pay Min was\nnot only a swordsman and a sword saint,\nbut also a soldier of the Tang Dynasty.\nNo wonder he chose to obey orders first\nin front of the Lord. Just as Lin Sha\nwas about to give Pay Min a gift to help\nhim unleash even greater power, several\nsystem voices came at the same time.\nDing! You have successfully recruited\nyour first hero in 13 hours and 56\nminutes. Your speed has made history.\nYou've set a new record on Earth. You\nrecruited heroes on your very first day\nin the Battle of all races, triggering a\nhidden reward. The god system rewards an\nextra hero and a legendary treasure\nchest. Signal interference is in\nprogress. Correction. The god system\nwill reward you with one epic chest and\none additional beautiful heroine which\nwill arrive soon with the demon tide.\nYour speed in recruiting heroes has set\na new record for earth. In 5 minutes,\nyou will be subject to signal jamming\nacross the entire planet. Correction.\na new record on Earth. An announcement\nwill be made across the entire Lon\nregion in five minutes. The voice of the\nGod system stopped, but Lin Xiao's heart\nwas filled with turbulent waves. He had\nactually made history on Earth. He was\nthe fastest newbie lord to recruit\nheroes on the entire planet. He knew he\nwould set a record, perhaps in the\nnewbie zone or the official zone, but he\nnever imagined his record would break\nthe entire planet's record. with the\nLord's talent granting a 100% increase\nin building speed, the mini tavern, and\nthe ability to farm resources across the\nentire map without wasting time on\nexploration. He combined these three\nelements to achieve a historic feat.\nAlso, what does bonus hero mean? Does it\nmean I can get two heroes with just one\nbook? Also, why does the god system\nemphasize that this hero is a female\nhero? And why is she here again with the\narrival of the demonic tide? Also, will\nthere be a district-wide announcement\nlater? Chapter 25 rewards you with a\nbeautiful female hero. Here at 11:55\np.m., the chat channel in the 89757\nnewb zone became lively once again. On\nthe first night in the newbie zone,\nthere are always too many things to do.\nDinglay, finally finished. My lord's\nmanner started upgrading an hour ago.\nUpgrading completed within a day.\nEveryone, how's your progress? By the\nway, I've also prepared the tavern's\nmaterials. At this rate, I might be able\nto recruit my first hero tomorrow. In\nthis battlefield of myriad races vying\nfor supremacy, having my own hero and\nnot having to charge into battle alone\nis truly blissful. Dinglays smug remarks\nimmediately caused a stir in the chat\nchannel. Wow, Dinglay is still up so\nlate, working so hard. No wonder he has\na talent. By the way, Dinglay, what is\nyour talent? Keep it a secret. Hey, I'm\nnot afraid of geniuses. I'm afraid of\ngeniuses who work even harder than you.\nMy god, I just scouted the area during\nthe day and lost five units only to\ncapture two mines. There's still no sign\nof copper or iron mines. And Dinglay has\nalready started upgrading his lord's\nmanor. Wow, a hero has emerged in just 3\ndays. That's fast enough to put us in\nthe top tier of the LN region. Dinglay\nis definitely going to be a top player\nin the official region from now on. Most\nnew lords follow a step-by-step\napproach, scouting, dispelling the fog\nof war, then grinding monsters, and\ncapturing resource veins. Therefore, it\nis indeed rare for a new player to be\nable to start upgrading their lord's\nmanor on the first day. Haha, my little\nsister is also quite lucky today. She\njust secured the necessary mineral vein\nand will be able to start upgrading the\nLord's manor later. Hey girl upstairs,\nwant to get to know each other? Tell me\nyour coordinates and I'll come and keep\nwatch for you. Seeing that someone was\nable to collect all the resources on the\nfirst day and that the person was a\ngirl, some people had wicked ideas,\nmaking everyone nervous.\nAlthough my little sister is somewhat\npretty, she's definitely not brainless.\nMy family has elite troops, so we're not\nafraid of you. Girl, you didn't say\nwhere you were, but you've already\nrevealed your abilities. Girl, are you\nout of your mind? The chat channel fell\nsilent again. Luckily, the pretty girl\nhadn't revealed her location, otherwise\na real tragedy would have occurred. Xiao\nDatong, what are you so arrogant about?\nYou guys are busy collecting resources\nwhile I'm busy leveling up. I'm already\nlevel five. Lizard cavalry. Click to\nview. Gene, Dang, brothers, Datong are\nindeed frank. We are strong enough, so\nwe are not afraid to expose our\nstrength. I'm also level six. I still\nhave two rare unit squads, hog riders\nand harpies. Click to view. My brother\nand I are going to do something big\ntomorrow, and we would appreciate it if\nyou could all do us a favor and witness\nit. Xiao Datong and Gene Dang s comments\nonce again silenced the chat channel.\nIndeed, most lords are busy collecting\nresources, and leveling up is a matter\nfor later. After all, the battlefield of\nthe myriad races is a contest based on\nthe overall strength of the territory.\nHowever, these two brothers are equipped\nwith rare troops and are constantly\nleveling up. They must have gained more\nexperience and items than others, and\ntheir strength in the early stages is\nprobably much greater than everyone\nelse's. Putting aside other things, most\nof the new lords are currently only at\nlevel one or two, leading ordinary\ntroops and ordinary peasants. Seeing\nthat no one dared to speak, Zhiao Datang\nand Gene Dang became smug again. What's\nwrong? Scared now. This is what they\ncall when the neighbor hoards food. I\nhoard guns. The neighbor is my granary,\nhuh? Dinglay, you think you're so great?\nYou dare to act tough in front of me?\nI'll level up first, then go farm\nresources from the mines. I'll upgrade\nmy lord's mansion by tomorrow at the\nlatest, but I'm much stronger than you\nguys. Ziao Datang was smug, and no one\nin the entire chat channel dared to\nrespond to him. His apparent\nrecklessness was even a facade. He\nalready possessed a second team of rare\ntroops, as well as teleportation and\nquest tokens. Gene Datong also had a\nnecromancer summoning scroll. The two of\nthem were far stronger than they\nappeared. On the surface, his strength\nis enough to crush 90% of the newbies.\nAnd in reality, he can crush 99% of\nthem. If it weren't for the possibility\nthat every district might have some\nimmortal descendants or the offspring of\nhigh-ranking officials, Xiao Datang and\nGene Dang would even believe that the\ntwo of them could already rule the\n89,757\nnewbie district. They've got their hands\non this newbie zone. But the thought of\nthat person who treated him like he was\nnothing cast a shadow overhau mood. That\nperson was clearly so weak. Yet he\nignored him time and time again. Just\nlike a lion ignores an ant. His presence\npierced Xiao Datongs good mood. Lyn\nShiao. His lord talent is only F-level\ntrash. And myself B rank talent, two\nrare troop units, a level five lord.\nCombat power as high as 25 stars. and\nyou'll also have good luck frequently\ngetting great equipment. I am the chosen\none yet I am treated like air by such a\ngood for nothing. How can I swallow this\ninsult? Thinking of this, Xiao Daong was\nfurious and couldn't help but start\ncursing in the chat channel again. Lyn\nShiao, I'm giving you one last chance.\nI'm already level five. Are you scared\nyet? Now, immediately hand over the\nblack long sword. Submit to me and I'll\nspare your life. Don't wait until\ntomorrow to regret it. I never let\nanyone who dares to mess with me get\naway with it. After making those harsh\nremarks, the chat channel remained\nsilent. Xiao Daong knew that everyone\nwas watching the chat channel, waiting\nfor Lyn Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s response, and paying\nclose attention to this duel. But Lynn\nShiao himself didn't care at all.\nThinking of this, Ziao Datang felt even\nmore agitated and couldn't help but\ncontinue. Lynn Shiao, aren't you a\ngenius from Jangdong number three Middle\nSchool? Aren't you very awesome? What?\nYou're too scared to speak. You pathetic\nranger lord. You didn't even have the\nchance to recruit your first hero. Lyn\nShia, answer me. Answer me. Ding.\nRegionwide announcement. Lynn Shia from\nthe Lon region 89757\nnewbie zone of the blue star realm has\nsuccessfully recruited the first hero,\nsetting a new record for the Lan region.\nThe system rewards him with an\nadditional beautiful female hero and one\nepic treasure chest. Lynn Shiao from the\nLong Non region 89757\nepic treasure chest blue star. The\nsystem announcement sounded three times\nand Lin Shia, who was drinking water,\nchoked and coughed incessantly from the\nsudden sound. Cough, cough. What the\nhell? Why did you have to announce the\nreward in the first place? This is\ntroublesome. The whole region knows I\nhave an epic treasure chest, and I'm\ngoing to become the target of everyone's\nhatred. Fortunately, it's just an epic\ntreasure chest. Although it's rare, I've\ngotten some myself every year when I was\nplaying Monster Treasure House. And\nwhat's with the system rewarding an\nextra beautiful female hero? Newbie zone\nin Lon region. A tall, beautiful, and\naloof girl is deep in thought with her\neyes closed. Behind her stood the\norderly buildings of the territory, row\nupon row, neatly arranged, towering\nwalls and sharp arrow towers. Dozens of\nsoldiers were practicing in the spacious\nopen space of the Lord's mansion. A\nvaliant female soldier approached the\nstunningly beautiful woman and\nwhispered, \"Miss, everything is ready.\nOur lord's manor will be upgraded in 3\nhours. Then we'll use the mini tavern to\nbecome the first lord in the entire\nregion to recruit a hero. This time\nwe're sure to set a record.\" Also, Mrs.\nfirst hero has been chosen. Just then, a\nsystem announcement that resounded\nthroughout the entire region came\nthrough. The female solders's voice was\nfilled with surprise. Someone beat us to\nit. Who is it? We've been preparing for\nso long. We even bought speed up\ntalismans at a high price. We could have\nbeen number one. The usually calm and\ncollected, stunningly beautiful woman\nsuddenly opened her eyes. It's him, Lyn\nSha. I knew he was no ordinary person. A\nmere F-level talent would never be\nenough to defeat him. Then after hearing\nthe second half of the announcement, a\nfaint smile appeared on the beautiful\nwoman's lips, rewarding a beautiful\nfemale hero. This guy's really got some\nnerve this way. Ziao Dahongs words were\nstill hanging in the chat channel, and\nthe system announcement for the entire\nregion had already sounded three times.\nHis mouth was agape as if struck by\nlightning, and he had no idea what year\nit was. 1 second, 2 seconds, 3 seconds.\nHaha. The chat channel was suddenly\nflooded with bursts of laughter. Chapter\n26. Believe Lin Shia or believe I am\nChin Sher Huang. Haha. This is\nhilarious. It's a slap in the face. A\ncomplete slap in the face. You're not a\ncomedian, are you? Haha. I he was\noriginally lying in the arms of a\nbeautiful woman watching the show, but\nthis scene made me laugh so hard I was\nshaking with laughter. You used the\nwrong idiom, didn't you? Why are you\nbehaving so frivolously, you grown man?\nThe beautiful women next to me were\nlaughing so hard they couldn't breathe\nand their bodies were shaking so badly\nthey were practically falling on me.\nPuff. The previously subdued chat\nchannel is now filled with a joyful\natmosphere as all the novice lords who\nhaven't slept are chiming in with their\nown words, mocking the scene that just\nunfolded. Enough. Shut up. Realizing\nwhat was happening, Xiao Datong flew\ninto a rage again. Shut the hell up.\nSuppression talisman. Suppression\ntalisman. Suppression talisman. The\ngroup threatened by Ziao Datong\ngradually calmed down. After a moment,\nXiao Daong said in a sinister tone,\n\"That's more like it. Lyn Shia can set a\nrecord. A lord with F-level talent, no\nmoney, and no power can set a record. I\ndon't believe it for a second. Do you\nbelieve Lin Sha can be the first to\nrecruit heroes? Or do you believe I am\nChin Sher Huang?\" He a trust Lin Shao\nDatang at Heay. Suppression talisman,\nteleport talisman, lizard rider, orc\nveteran. He a chin shang Xiao. You're\nsmart to know what's good for you. Lin\nShiao, step forward. Is there a system\nerror or is there another Lin Sha in the\nnewbie zone? No one responded to Xiao\nDaton&lt;unk&gt;s question, but Gene Dang\nimmediately messaged Xiao Datong\nprivately. Dong, you're foolish. How\ncould you reveal all your trump cards?\nNow everyone knows you have two rare\ntroop types and teleportation scrolls.\nXiao Dat. Uh, damn it. I forgot. It's\nall Heay's fault. I'll kill him. Gene\nDang. Forget it. Forget it. A small act\nof impatience can ruin a big plan. It's\nnot too late to deal with him after\nwe've dealt with Lin Shiao. Didn't he\nsay he's surrounded by beautiful women?\nHe probably has a lot of female\nsoldiers. Xiao Daton&lt;unk&gt;s eyes lit up.\nThat's right. Surrounded by beauties.\nThis kid is quite lucky with women. But\ndo you think Lynn Shiao actually\nrecruited the first hero and the second\nhero as a system reward? Gin Shang. I\nalso find this very strange. How could\nan F-rank character set a record? But\nthe god system has never made a mistake\nbefore. Xiao Datang. Does that mean Lynn\nShiao is stronger than us now? No. Gene\nDang pondered for a moment and said,\n\"First of all, we cannot be sure whether\nLin Shiao is really recruiting heroes.\nSecondly, newly recruited heroes have\nonly about twice the stats of troops of\nthe same quality. Lyn Shia is just a\npoor kid. How powerful can ordinary\nquality heroes be? They might not even\nbe able to defeat rare troops. Again,\nyou forgot. If a hero has truly been\nrecruited, it means he's about to\nencounter a demonic tide sent by the\nmain god system. Yes, and the demon\ntide. Xiao Datangs eyes lit up as well.\nThe faster you recruit heroes, the\nfiercer the demonic tide will be. This\nkid recruited heroes on the very first\nday. The demonic tide will definitely be\nincredibly powerful for him. Waha! Xiao\nDaong became increasingly happy and\nstarted speaking publicly in the chat\nchannel again. \"Lin Xiao, you're in big\ntrouble recruiting heroes now. Can you\nwithstand the demonic tide? Even if you\nbring two ordinary heroes, you're no\nmatch for the demon tide.\" Haha, I'll be\nright here watching how you, an orphan\nwith no parents, die. I'll be waiting to\ncollect your corpse. And when the time\ncomes, your black long sword will still\nbe mine. The moment the system\nannouncement was made, Chufunga, who was\nalso organizing resources within her\nterritory, understood what was\nhappening. A demonic tide. How did Lin\nSha recruit heroes so quickly? Can he\nhandle the demonic tide? Chufinga\nimmediately initiated a communication\nwith Lin Shiao. After a brief flashing\ncommunication signal, Lin Shiao answered\nthe call. Phone go. What's the matter?\nLyn Sha, you've really made it to the\ntop and you're even recruiting heroes.\nChufinga's flamboyant red hair\nimmediately filled the entire screen.\nLyn Sha couldn't help but lean back\nslightly so as not to have Chufinga's\nface looming in front of him. Yes, I\nhave already recruited heroes. How did\nyou do that? I'll tell you about that\nlater. It depends on talent. I'm\npreparing to fight against the demonic\ntide. Lynn Shiao didn't want to deceive\nhis friend, nor did he want to tell\nChufunga directly right now. This will\nlet him know some secrets he shouldn't\nknow, which may not be good for him. At\nthis moment, Chufinga saw Saul Linn and\nseveral phantom archers behind Lin Shia\nthrough the main gods chat video window.\nLynn Shao sent all the MO Dao iron\nguards and divine arm archers to guard\nthe surroundings, leaving only some\nphantom archers behind. Phantom shooter.\nAs a powerful ranged unit, Chufinga\nnaturally recognized the phantom archer\nand immediately blurted it out. Yes,\nthis is the phantom shooter. Oh, I see.\nLyn Sha, you're really something.\nShufinga suddenly realized, feeling much\nrelieved. You must have used your talent\nfor peace combined with your oratory\nskills to win over a group of phantom\narchers, right? Then we can use these\nphantom archers to farm resources\nwithout taking any damage, occupy the\nmines, and be the first to upgrade the\nlord's manor, build a tavern, and\nrecruit heroes. You're definitely lucky.\nThere are resources right around your\nspawn point. Excellent. Excellent.\nChufinger's eyes were full of\nsatisfaction. Even an F- level talent\nshines brightly in your hands. You truly\ndeserve it. This Phoenix song, no need\nto say more. You truly deserve the title\nof genius. You have both courage and\nluck. Chufinga interrupted. With the\nphantom archers helping you defend a\ncity, this wave of demonic tide should\nbe a sure thing. Lyn Shiao, I can't lose\nto you by too much. I'm hanging up now.\nContact me if you need anything. After\nsaying that, Chufinga hung up the call,\nleaving Lin Shia with a rice smile on\nhis face. He didn't need to explain\nhimself. Chufinga already understood\nhim. Lyn Shia shook his head and was\nabout to leave when Chufunga initiated\nanother communication. Lyn Shiao,\nsomething terrible has happened. That\nguy, Xiao Datong, actually has\nteleportation talismans and two teams of\nrare troops, too. You'd better be\ncareful. It turned out that Chufinga had\nseen Xiao Dataong&lt;unk&gt;s message in the\nchat channel and instantly realized how\ndangerous Xiao Daong was. She then\nturned back to remind Lin Shiao, \"Okay,\nI understand. I'll be careful.\" Seeing\nhis brother make a special trip back,\nLyn Sha was also very moved and promised\nChufinga, \"Don't worry about me. My\ntroops are far stronger than his.\nPhantom archers are an excellent unit,\nbut they are weak in close combat. They\ncan't be allowed to get close, otherwise\nthey might be ambushed by that kid. Xiao\nDot. Chufinga offered a couple of\nreminders, and knowing that Lin Shiao\nhad phantom archers and was on guard,\nshe wasn't too worried and hung up the\ncall again. Lyn Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s curiosity was\nalso peaked. So, he opened the chat\nchannel and took a look. Hell, what a\nclown. People like that aren't worth my\ntime to deal with. Lynn Shiao shook his\nhead, intending to ignore Xiao Datong\nand Gene Dashangs incompetent rage once\nagain. But seeing Xiao Daongs enraged\ninsults, he typed a string of messages\nin the chat channel. I will not offend\nothers unless they offend me. If they\ndo, I will be punished by heaven and\nearth. Xiao Datong, I'm warning you,\ndon't go too far. Even a clay figure has\na temper. Let alone Lin Shia, who has\nalways wanted to become the most\npowerful lord. He cannot tolerate others\ntrampling on his dignity. Ziao Dataong\nhas crossed the line by insulting his\nparents. Lyn Shiao then closed the chat\nchannel. The walls are built, the\nfarmers have been called back, and the\nsoldiers are all on high alert. We are\nfully prepared to deal with the demonic\ntide. Why haven't the systems extra hero\nrewards and epic chests arrived yet? As\nI pondered, a system notification\nsounded. Ding. Your territory will be\nattacked by a demonic tide in 3 minutes.\nDifficulty of this demonic tide Srank.\nChapter 27. A sword comes from the east.\nThe succubus makes her appearance. An\nSrank difficulty demonic tide. Level\ndemonic tide. In the first book in his\ntextbook when upgrading your lord's\nmanner and recruiting your first hero,\nyou will encounter a demonic tide.\nGenerally speaking, the magic tides in\nthe beginner area are D level or C\nlevel. Even if a beginner lord with\nA-level talent sets some records in the\nbeginner area and shows extraordinary\ntalent, the god system will at most set\nAB level magic tide in order to hone the\nnewcomers. An S ranked demonic tide is\nunheard of in the newbie zone. It's only\noccasionally encountered by top players\nin the official zones at specific\nstages. But although it's an S rank\nmagic tide, it's fortunate that it's\nactivated based on the lord's overall\nstrength. The S rank magic tide in the\nbeginner area is definitely not as good\nas the S rank magic tide in the official\narea. Otherwise, if thousands of level\n100 monsters charged at the start, even\nXiang Yu in his true form probably\nwouldn't be able to withstand it. This\nshows that my talent and strength are\ntoo great, triggering the relevant\nconditions of the god system, Lyn Sha\npondered. Two teams of legendary gold\nunits, 42 phantom archers, setting a\nrecord for the fastest hero recruitment\non Earth. The SSS level talent is\nprobably the result of these combined,\nwhich led me to encounter an\nunprecedented S-level magic tide in the\nnewbie zone. However, the battlefield\nfor the struggle for supremacy among all\nraces is not a battlefield where\neveryone is to die, but a battlefield to\ncultivate lords and make them stronger.\nThere will be no situation where certain\ndeath is inevitable. Let's meet force\nwith force and water with earth. Let me\nsee just how powerful the S-class\ndemonic tide really is. Lyn Xiao's\nfighting spirit was ignited by the\nSclass demonic tide, and he began to\nlook forward to it. He said to Pay Min,\nwho was meditating with his eyes closed.\nPay Min, you've come at just the right\ntime. A wave of incredibly powerful\nmonsters is approaching. Your sword is\nready to be drawn. Pay Min slowly opened\nhis eyes and smiled. You've come at the\nperfect time. The two arrived at the\nentrance to Linia's territory where all\nthe Emo Dao iron guards, divine arm\narchers, and phantom archers were on\nhigh alert. The system s demonic tides\nusually rushed towards the territory\nopenly and honestly. Coincidentally,\nafter Lyn Xiao's Lord's Manor was\nupgraded to the first level, it\ncompletely occupied the bottleneck of\nthe valley. Lynho's territory is\nsurrounded by cliffs on two sides and a\nriver and high walls behind it. If the\ndemonic tides want to come over, they\nmust come directly through the territo's\ngate. This gave Lynn Shiao the\nopportunity to concentrate his defensive\nforces on defense. In the distance, huge\ndark clouds appeared in the sky. As the\nblack clouds swirled, twisted and\ndeformed figures fell straight down from\nthe sky, carrying flames and black\nsmoke. They crashed among the rocks in\nthe wilderness, and some also crashed\ninto the gathering places of wild\nmonsters. The demonic mist churned and\nscreams rang out. These unfortunate\nmonsters were instantly infected by the\ndemonic tide and turned into demons as\nwell. Slowly, one by one, the monsters\nrose from the ground, their numbers\nincreasing and their aura growing more\nand more terrifying. Suddenly, a shrill\nhowl rang out, and thousands of demons\nseemed to receive a signal, rushing\ntowards Lyn Xiao's territory without\nregard for anything else. They're here.\nIron guards of the Mod Dao, prepare.\nDivine Archer, fire. Phantom shooter,\nread the bow. Meteor showers rained\ndown, flames streaking across the sky\nwith tremendous force, and the entire\nnewbie zone witnessed this terrifying\nscene. \"What the hell is this?\" someone\nmuttered to themselves, trembling with\nfear. Fortunately, the terrifying thing\nin the sky fell far away from me,\nsomeone said with relief, \"Is this a\ndemonic tide? I've never heard of a\ndemonic tide like this before, someone\nasked in the chat channel. I don't know.\nMaybe it's a system bug. What system\nbug? Isn't this all Lin Xiao's doing?\nXiao Daong said gloatingly. This kid\nbroke the record. Now he's getting his\ncomeuppants. May he be struck down by\nlightning. Chufinga also looked solemnly\nat the meteor shower falling\ncontinuously in the distant sky, turned\non his communication device, and was\nready at any time. He was preparing to\nconnect to that person's communication\nand he was also ready to call his own\nfather at any moment but he won't\ncontact that person again. The unspoken\nunderstanding between the brothers made\nhim realize that if they really\nencountered a problem they couldn't\nhandle that person would definitely come\nto him. If someone can handle things but\nyou keep contacting them that's not\nconcern that's charity. That person has\ntoo much pride and will never accept\ncharity from others. Is Lin Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s\ndemonic tide here to deal with you? Iron\nGuards of the Mod Dao, hold your ground.\nTang Ya&lt;unk&gt;s powerful voice rang out,\nand 10 Modao Iron Guards stood at the\ngate of the territory, their backs to\nthe territory, ready to deploy their 3 m\nlong Dao swords. The rolling black\nclouds and demonic mists surged in. And\nat the forefront were the most common\ndemonic creatures, demon children,\nhorned demons, and demonic hounds, both\ncommon and superior. Their numbers as\nendless as ants moving house. Behind\nthem were fierce demons and bone demons\nof excellent and rare quality, also\nstretching far and wide, with no end in\nsight. The surging demonic army were\nseveral nest demons. Massive creatures\ncomposed of enormous mouth parts and\ntentacles. Instantly recognizable as\nterrifying. These were epic beings of\nthe demon race, possessing high attack\nand defense and capable of continuously\ncreating new demonic children and horned\ndemons. In addition to these main\ndemonic armies, there are also demonic\npuppets such as ghouls, swollen\ndrowners, mist demons, and plague\nzombies. transformed from neutral\nmonsters that were infected and killed\nby the demonic tide during the meteor\nshower just now. Five-headed nest\ndemons. With the help of Song Rui's\neagle eye ability, Lin Sha directly saw\nthe most dangerous creature in this\ndemonic tide through the black mist.\nNest demon. Race demon. Level 30.\nQuality epic. Attributes: Strength 115.\nSpirit 45. Constitution 125. Soul 45.\nCombat power rating 105 stars. Skills\nregeneration, infection, flame immunity,\nreproduction. Perhaps it's because I've\nseen too many of my own legendary gold\nunits. The attributes that would terrify\nother new lords are nothing to me. Lynn\nSha shook his head. This was the first\nunit he had encountered that was level\n30, and it was an epic unit with a\ncombat power rating of 105 stars.\nLooking at the data panel alone, the 115\nstrength and 125 constitution are far\nsuperior to the attributes of the MO Dao\nIron Guard. But Lynn Sha remained\nunmoved. If the strongest nest demon\nonly has this attribute, we should be\nable to get through this without any\nmajor dangers. Lynn Sha said softly. Pay\nMin standing to the side looked at Xiao\nMo with a fierce fighting spirit. My\nlord, leave me a few of these demons.\nI'll kill them all before I deal with\nthem. Okay, go. Pay Min moved with\nlightning speed and walked straight out\nof the territo's gate. Facing them, a\ntidal wave of demon children and horned\ndemons surged forth. Just ants. Pay\nMin's long robes fluttered without wind,\nand his long hair swayed behind his\nhead, exuding an indescribable elegance\nand freedom. He formed a swordfinger\ngesture with his right hand and pointed\nit towards the densest part of the\ndemonic tide. \"Rise!\" Payman transformed\ninto a sword light, soaring into the sky\nand cutting through the demonic tide.\nWherever he went, all the demons were\nannihilated. A sword comes from the\neast. Pay Min transforms into sword\nenergy, reaching a state of\nselflessness, using his body as a sword\nand the sword to control himself,\ndealing damage equal to 10 points of his\nown strength plus spirit plus soul\nattributes, ignoring magic immunity and\nevasion and cannot be controlled while\ncasting. Payman's sword technique almost\ncut the demonic tide in half. Then Pay\nMin used his movement techniques to move\naround and fight amidst the demonic\ntide. Truly worthy of the title of sword\nsaint. Lyn Sha stood quietly at the gate\nof the territory and exclaimed, \"As a\nlord, his main role is to stabilize the\nmorale of the army and express his\nconfidence in victory. But at that\nmoment, affected by pay men's\nswordsmanship, the rear of the demonic\ntide became somewhat chaotic. Hm. Could\nit be that the true leader of this wave\nof demonic tide has arrived? Lyn Sha\nalso felt that this time the five nest\ndemons were not enough and did not seem\nlike a challenge for his s class demon\ntide. Lyn Sha immediately looked over\nand saw two women wearing tight leather\nclothes that accentuated their beautiful\nfigures with big eyes, red lips, and\nfaces that were both innocent and\nalluring. They had two small long horns\non their heads and long thin tails\nbehind them. They walked out from the\nvery end of the demonic tide. It's a\nsuccubus. One of the succubi sensed\nsomething, glanced at Lyn Sha, then\nsmiled quietly, and whispered to the\nother succubus beside her. When the\nother succubus turned around, she and\nLyn Sha made eye contact. Although the\ntwo were separated by a distant\nbattlefield, their eyes met in an\ninstant. Lyn Sha suddenly felt a loud\nboom in his head and his thoughts froze\nfor a moment. Chapter 28. Demon Tide\nboss. The legendary flame demon makes\nits appearance. Just as Lin Sha was in a\nbrief mental vacuum, the fighting near\nthe territory naturally did not stop.\nCall out. The sound of air being torn\napart came from nearby, and the archers\nunleashed their first volley. The\ntin-headed bone demon and the fierce\ndemon immediately fell dead. Meanwhile,\nthe Phantom Archer had already drawn his\nbow, ready to fire at any moment. These\ntwo powerful ranged archers only\ntargeted enemies of superior quality or\nhigher, ignoring the most numerous demon\nchildren and horned demons. Because\nthose weak but numerous enemies are\nreserved for the iron guards of the Mod\nDao, when the demonic tide reached a\ndistance of 200 m, the Phantom Archer\nfired his arrow. Swish, swish, swish.\nThe Phantom Archers dominance among\nelite units is inseparable from their\nrapid fire ability. These elves arrows\nare fast and accurate, even faster than\nthe divine archers. The divine arm bow\nfor long range shooting. They need to\nstep on the bow to draw it, firing one\narrow every 3 seconds. When they enter\nthe normal firing range for rapid fire,\nthey can simply pull back the giant\ncrossbow with their hands, achieving one\narrow per second. But that's not enough.\nThe Phantom Archer can fire two arrows\nper second. The incredibly fast\nsoldering can fire three arrows per\nsecond. This is also the type of soldier\nthat Lynn Shiao decided to go to great\nlengths to recruit. The phantom archer's\nrate of fire effectively compensates for\nthe divine archer's weakness. If S Ruer\nand his men were like Barrett rifles,\nincredibly powerful and capable of\npoint-to-point demolition, but requiring\nthem to pull the bolt after each shot,\nthen Solin and his men were like fully\nautomatic rifles, and very accurate ones\nat that. The Phantom Archer's first\narrow pierced the monster. The second\narrow was already flying in midair, and\nthe third arrow was already knocked in\nthe Phantom Archer's hand. This\nextremely high rate of fire is best\nsuited for dealing with large numbers of\nfragile enemies. And so ghouls, bloated\ndrowners, and horned demons fell in\ndroves. However, the demonic tide was\nlike a stream blocked by pebbles.\nAlthough it kept creating waves, the\ndemons still rushed to the front of the\nterritory. Standing before the monsters\nwere 10 burly men, tall and strong, clad\nin heavy armor, and wielding long\nswords. The MO DAO Iron Guard S skill\nhas been activated. Pillar of strength.\nWhen facing a superior enemy with a\ncombat strength rating close to or\nexceeding that of your own, increases\nmorale and strength, spirit, and\nconstitution. The greater the number of\nenemies, the more morale, strength, and\nconstitution are increased. This effect\nis doubled when protecting your lord and\nheroes. Faced with a large number of\npowerful demons and nightmare horses\nwhose strength was comparable to his own\non paper, the Mod Dao Iron Guard\nimmediately pushed his pillar of\nstrength skill to its limit. Increases\nthree-dimensional strength, spirit, and\nbody attributes by 100% and doubles the\nprotection for the lord, increasing\nstrength, spirit, and body attributes by\n200%. Heroic: The iron guards of the mo\ndown never retreat. The more enemies\nthere are, the stronger there will\nbecomes. Activated when the number of\nenemies exceeds five times the number of\niron guards of the Mod Dao, increasing\nhealth by 5% and so on up to a maximum\nincrease of 100% of maximum health. The\nlife value of the MO DAO iron body is\nalso directly increased by 100%. The\ncurrent MO DAO iron guard are as\nfollows. Strength 83 + 166 + 42. Spirit\n39 + 78 + 19. Constitution 72 + 144 +\n36. Soul 34 + 68 + 12. In the\nbattlefield where all races v for\nsupremacy, health points are a hidden\nattribute linked to physical strength\nand are generally not visible. Such a\nhealth value is more realistic because\neven the most powerful creature will die\nif it is hit in a vital spot or its head\nis cut off. Even with tens of thousands\nof health points, several rounds of\nreinforcements, the MO Dao iron guards\nwith their two layers of iron armor are\ntruly tanky. With a howl, the monster\ncharged. With a single slash, Tangi\ncleaved seven or eight demonic children\ninto pieces. Then with a swift strike,\nanother slash was unleashed in\nmilliseconds, instantly killing more\nthan a dozen demon children and ghouls.\nAll the demons within a 3meter radius\nwere wiped out. All the MO Dao iron\nguards stood shoulderto-shoulder like a\ndam against a raging torrent, blocking\nall the monsters before them. Whether\nthe monsters were common, fine, rare, or\nexceptional quality, from level one to\nlevel 20, none could withstand a single\nstrike from the Mod Dao. The mist of the\nsilent night had been dispelled by the\nmeteor shower, and moonlight shone down.\nThe sky was ablaze with fire light,\nilluminating the endless tide of demons.\nAmidst the demonic tide, a sword light,\nsharp and unstoppable, crisscrossed with\nsword energy, illuminating the demonic\ntide. Before the demonic tide, a wall of\npeople stood proudly, advancing like a\nwall. One by one, rare and exceptional\nmonsters were targeted and killed by the\ndivine archer, while fine and rare\nmonsters were slain by a hail of arrows\nfrom the phantom archer. This demonic\ntide, which had terrified most of the\nnovice lords to the point of silence,\nwas actually stopped by Lyn Sha and his\nheroes and troops. No one noticed that\nLyn Sha was standing motionless, his\neyes unfocused. Two stunningly beautiful\nsuccubi stood at the very back of the\ndemonic tide, coldly watching the scene\nunfold, as if the deaths and injuries of\nthe demons before them had nothing to do\nwith them. One of the succubi licked her\nlips, her delicate pink lips, and\nscarlet tongue, creating a seductive\ninterplay. Master, is this the human?\nAlthough he looks quite handsome, he is\nso weak and easily defeated. The other\nsuccubus chuckled. He's got something. I\ncan't figure out his true background. It\nseems he doesn't belong to this era. Not\nbelonging to this era. The succubus,\naddressed as master, did not answer the\nquestion, but instead said, \"Let's go.\nI've already met the person the ancient\ndemon spoke of. He has potential and is\nquite good-looking. If he survives, this\nprincess really likes the raising a\nchild type of relationship. You know,\nlet Tungle test his strength first. With\nthat, the succubus waved her hand\ngently, opening a portal. The two\nstepped into the portal and disappeared.\nDing! Your hero, Sword Saint Pay Min,\nhas slain the Nest Demon Lord, gaining\n34,000 experience points, 50 energy, and\n867 gold. The notification from the main\ngod system startled Lin Sha awake. What\njust happened to me? Lyn Sha suddenly\nrealized what had just happened. He saw\ntwo succubi at the end of the demonic\ntide. One of the succubi even made eye\ncontact with him and then he lost\nconsciousness. No one even knew about\nit. Although it was only for a brief\nmoment, the danger involved was\nself-evident. Wait, where's the\nsuccubus? Lynn Shiao immediately\nmobilized the spirit of Xiang Yu,\ngripped his spear, and poured his power\ninto himself to boost his aura. Seong\nRue, come to my side and protect me.\nTangg Yi blocked the main entrance. Lyn\nShao called Song Ruer, who immediately\ncame over, drew his divine crossbow, and\nstood guard for Lin Shao. After making\nsufficient preparations, Lyn Sha raised\nhis head again and looked at the demonic\ntide. The demon tide had already been\ndecimated by his own group of fierce\nmen, but Lyn Sha looked closely and\ncould not find the succubus. Upon closer\nexamination of my body and mind, I found\nnothing unusual. Was that just a\nhallucination? After searching\nrepeatedly, Lynn Shia still couldn't\nfind it and couldn't help but doubt his\nexperience. After all, succubi are only\nepic creatures and shouldn't have such\npower. It's unbelievable that a single\nglance from thousands of meters away\ncould make me, who was possessed by the\nspirit of Xiang Yu, lose consciousness.\nBe careful when you encounter Succubi in\nthe future. And don't fall into their\ntraps. Lyn Shiao shook his head. He had\na cheat code. Just then, a massive body\nrose slowly from behind the demonic\ntide. Its enormous size, burning body,\nand radiant glow even drew the attention\nof everyone on the battlefield. It was a\nfire demon that was 10 m tall. Legendary\ncreature. Chapter 29. Slaying the flame\ndemon. The beautiful heroine has been\ndistributed. Fire demon Tungle. Race:\nHigh Demon. Level 30. Quality golden\nlegend. Attributes: Strength 185. Spirit\n175. Constitution 90, soul 175. Combat\npower rating 179 stars. Skills: Rank A,\nCommand, Split Attack, Flame Immunity,\nSummon Volcano, Incineration,\nResurrection. The Flame Demon appeared.\nAll the monsters on the battlefield\nbecame excited as if they had been\ninjected with adrenaline. Domination\nrank A increases all attributes of all\ncreatures within the demon tide by 30%.\nIn an instant, the previously scattered\ndemonic tide rose up again.\nLynhiao&lt;unk&gt;s eyes flickered when he saw\nthe flame demon attribute. Both are\nlevel 30, but the legendary gold flame\ndemon is almost twice as strong as the\nepic nest demon. It even has a race\nlisted as high demon with a built-in 30%\nall attribute boost. While it can't\nmatch the 20% all attribute boost from\nits own eternal peace skill combined\nwith the 30% all attribute boost from\nXiang Yu's heroic soul, it's more than\nqualified to be the final boss of this S\nclass, Demonic Tide. As for why it's\nlevel 30, that's because the highest\nlevel the newbie zone can accommodate is\nlevel 30. The Balro was almost entirely\ncomposed of flames. With a wave of his\nhands, two huge and scorching fireballs\nimmediately hurdled towards the Lord's\nmansion. Boom! Boom! Two loud explosions\nrang out, and the territory's barrier\nwas immediately severely damaged. Ding!\nYour territo's walls have suffered heavy\ndamage. Current defense value 378/2,000.\nWith just one strike, the front wall of\nthe territory was completely destroyed.\nThis Balrog is also a magic attack and\nranged unit. It's all right. The\nterritory's total defense is 12,000. It\ncan withstand a few more hits. Lyn Shiao\nsecretly marveled that his lord's manner\nwas legendary and his own talent,\neternal peace, added 100% to the city's\ndefense value. Otherwise, a wall with a\nnormal defense value of 1,000 points\nplus a regular Lord's manner with a\ndefense value of 1,000 points would be\nnothing more than a single blow to the\nflame demon. As expected of an S class\ndemonic tide, ordinary lords would be\ninstantly annihilated upon encountering\nit. If we kill the flame demon right\nnow, everything will be solved. Just as\nLin Sha was about to give the order, Pay\nMin, who had just killed the second nest\ndemon, looked up and saw this scene.\nPerfect timing. Pay Min transformed into\na beam of sword light and charged\nstraight at the flame demon in the\ndistance. The flame demon as high spirit\nstat of 175 allowed him to quickly\ndiscover the human swordsman's\nintentions. Under the dazzling sword\nlight, the flame demon had no choice but\nto temporarily avoid its brilliance. The\ntowering flame demon nimblely dodged Pay\nMin's sword strike from the east, then\nraised his large hand and struck the\nhuman sword saint. Amidst the raging\nflames, Pay Min advanced instead of\nretreating. He was struck by the flame\ndemon, which instead aroused his\nferocity. Sacrifice oneself to break\nthrough thoughts is activated. Burning\nlife force using lost essence as a\ncatalyst enhances one's combat power.\nFor every 1% of life lost, one gains 2%\nmore strength and spirit. Upon breaking\nthrough the barrier, one detonates the\nattacks Pay Min has inflicted on the\nenemy, causing massive damage. Demon\ndie. Pay Min is a level one hero. Even\nwith Lyn Xiao's 50% attribute bonus, his\nfour stats are only around 80. When he\nwas hit by the flame demon, he suffered\na serious injury. As soon as the\nsacrifice to breakthrough thoughts was\nactivated, a burst of light immediately\nerupted from the flame demon's body. It\nturns out that the sword strike from the\neast had already struck the flame demon.\nThe flame demon cried out in pain as\npaymen struck again with his sword. The\nsword light piercing through the flame\ndemon's massive body. With a howl, the\nfire demon waved its hands, sending down\nand exploding more than a dozen\nfireballs that killed countless monsters\naround it. One of the fireballs also hit\nPay Min, who had no way to avoid it.\nPaymen floated in the air. The flame\ndemon pointed a finger and a beam of\nfire shot straight at Pay Min. Pay Min\nactivated his movement technique, dodged\nto the side, and transformed into a\nsword again, striking the flame demon\nand slicing through its body, leaving\ntrails of lava. The flame demon raised\nhis hand, and the ground trembled. A\nvolcano rose from the ground, and in an\ninstant, the sword light struck the\nvolcano, blocking the sword. Then,\nvolcanic lava erupted and shot out in\nall directions. Some lava fireballs flew\neverywhere and exploded between the iron\nguards of the Mod Dao, which the iron\nguards withtood. Others exploded on the\nterrito's walls and defensive\nformations, causing the territo's\ndefense value to drop rapidly. Some\nmagma fireballs seemed to have eyes,\nchasing after Pay Min. Pay Min activated\nsword dance to block all the magma, but\nhis offensive was already weakened and\nthe flame demon seized the opportunity\nto blast him away with a big fireball.\nHuh? Extraterrestrial demons, you've got\nsome skill. Pay men coughed up blood and\nwas about to activate, sacrifice, and\nbreak through thoughts again to fight\nthe flame demon to the death when a\nstreak of light flashed past him. Lyn\nShao had arrived at the center of the\nbattlefield at some point. Holding a\nlong spear, he was possessed by the\nspirit of Xiang Yu and flew away as a\nstreak of light, piercing the head of\nthe flame demon with a single thrust.\nLin Sha attributes strength 67 + 250,\nspirit 68 + 100, constitution 45 + 200,\nsoul 45 + 110. the critical hit rate of\nyourself and your heroes and troops to\n100%. Commonly known as a critical hit\nevery time, this shot carries a 100%\ncritical hit rate and is infused with\nthe power of a tripod and the essence of\nthe overlord spear, making its attack\npower terrifyingly high. One strike and\nthe flame demon is instantly killed.\nEven the rare spear that Lynn Sha\nbrought couldn't withstand the power of\nthis attack. After piercing the flame\ndemon's head, it slowly turned into\nashes. Ding! You have defeated the fire\ndemon Tungle, gaining 150,000 experience\npoints, 100 energy, and 2,000 gold.\nYou've obtained a legendary chest one.\nYou've obtained the Knights Lance Broer.\nAs the system notification sounded, the\nenormous fire demons slowly collapsed,\nmaking a huge crashing sound and\ngradually turned into ashes. After a few\nseconds of silence, \"Your lordship is\nmighty.\" All the soldiers who witnessed\nthis scene shouted in unison. Then they\nlaunched a fierce attack, charging out\nand turning the tide of monsters into a\nhorde of fleeing, panicked creatures,\n\"Well done!\" Lyn Sha reached out and\nhelped Pay Min, who was panting on the\nground, to his feet. \"Only today do I\nrealize that your excellency's martial\narts are unparalleled.\" Pay Min bowed\ndeeply to the ground, showing utter\nadmiration for Lin Sha. It's all thanks\nto Pay Min for wounding the flame demon\nand distracting him that I was able to\nstrike successfully. Lyn Sha didn't take\ncredit for it. He knew that his basic\nskills were far inferior to Pay Min's.\nIt was only through the power of Xiang\nYu&lt;unk&gt;s spirit and Paymen's cooperation\nthat he was able to kill the flame\ndemon. With the flame demon slain, the\namplification of the demonic tide\ndisappeared. But Lyn Xiao's troops were\ninspired by their lord's performance and\nlaunched an even more ferocious attack.\nThe demonic horde was quickly wiped out,\nexcept for a few that managed to escape\nover the valley or into the night. You\nhave successfully resisted the S-class\ndemonic tide. Rewards are being\ncalculated. The system notification\nsounded. Battle results. Destroy the\nfollowing enemies.

Birchwood Longbow. God,\nI haven't received my last reward yet.\nSeeing that his territory had\nsuccessfully resisted the demonic tide,\nLynsha felt relieved and casually asked,\nremembering that his extra hero reward\nhad not yet arrived. The god system\nnever responds to contestants, and Lyn\nXiao's question was just a casual\nremark, as if he were talking to\nhimself. With Pay Min, a legendary hero\nfrom China who could fight a level 30\nlegendary flame demon at level one. Lyn\nShia was already very satisfied.\nUnexpectedly, the god system directly\nreplied to Lyn Sha. Contestant number 11\n12020,\nyour extra female hero has been awarded.\nLyn Sha, question mark. The main god\nsystem replied to me, \"No, the key\nquestion is where is the beautiful\nheroine?\" Chapter 30. Only Lin Sha dared\nto suppress her Lin Xiao's strange\nbehavior. While Lin Sha was battling the\ndemon tide, Chufunga, who was sitting\nsolemnly in the same newbie zone,\nwaiting for news, was anxiously waiting\nfor a communication. Lyn Sha, being born\ninto poverty, is not a disgrace. A true\nman is one who can bend and stretch. If\nyou can't hold on, just attack. My\nberserkers are all ready. I also have\nteleportation scrolls. I'll go straight\nthere to help you fight off the demonic\ntide. If we act quickly, I can also ask\nthe old man to help me break through the\nbarrier. Amidst her muttering to\nherself, Chufinga's avatar flashed.\nSomeone had initiated a communication\nrequest. Chufinga didn't even look at it\nbefore taking the communication. Hey,\nLynsha, don't say anything else. Just\ntell me the coordinates. I'm coming\nright now. So, you really are in contact\nwith Lin Shiao. A clear, melodious\nfemale voice came from the other end of\nthe line. Chufinga was taken aback. She\nlooked up and saw a stunningly beautiful\nyet aloof face appear on the\ncommunication interface. Dug Jalon Yuri\nlooking for Lin Sha. Yes, Chufinga. Dugu\nJaolon said expressionlessly, her face\nas cold as ice, making it impossible to\ntell why she had come to him. The\nunusual activity that occurred in the\nnewbie zone has attracted the attention\nof the entire LN region. A man named Lyn\nSha set a new record for the entire Lan\nregion and received an additional\nreward. That's right, that person is Lyn\nSha, the one you know, Chufunga replied.\nUpon hearing Chufinga's affirmative\nreply, a glint seemed to flicker in Dugu\nJaolon&lt;unk&gt;s beautiful eyes, but it\nvanished in an instant. She continued,\n\"Someone just posted on the forum that a\nmeteor shower fell from the sky over\nyour newbie zone, indicating that at\nleast an epic level monster's demonic\ntide has appeared. Some analysts believe\nit might be a demonic tide of a level\ndifficulty.\" Lyn Shao Chufinga's\nexpression also wavered slightly.\nAlthough he knew about the complicated\nrelationship between the woman opposite\nhim and Lin Shiao, and it was not\nappropriate for him to comment too much.\nAt this moment, he could feel Dugu\nJaon&lt;unk&gt;s concern for Lin Shia. He\nhasn't contacted me yet, but his profile\npicture is still online. That's good.\nDugu Jaolon didn't say anything more and\nhung up the call. She understood Lin\nShia, the pride of the school, who had\nalways been superior to her, and his\narrogance. A system announcement came\non. Dugu Jalon, a player from the Lan\nregion of the Blueest Star realm, has\nsuccessfully recruited his first hero,\nbecoming the second ranked rookie lord\nin the Lan region this year. System\nreward one epic treasure chest. After\nthe announcement was repeated three\ntimes, a system notification sound,\nwhich only Dugu Jalon could hear,\nfollowed. Ding! Your territory will be\nDifficulty of this demonic tide. Rank A.\nIn the sky, a meteor shower began to\nform. Lin Sha, with your F-rank talent,\nand without any assistance, how did you\nmanage to deal with the A-rank demonic\ntide? Dugu Jaolan waved her hand and\npointed, and a three-ft long sword flew\ninto her hand like lightning. Ta sword.\nThe sword passed down through my family.\nOthers say it was created by an ancient\ndemon, but I can only feel close to it.\nThis time we fight side by side. Let me\nexperience the A-rank difficulty of the\ndemonic tide too. Chufinga breathed a\nsigh of relief. Although he was\narrogant, he was Lyn Xiao's best friend\nand had powerful backing. But he knew\nhow terrifying Duga Jaolon was. This\nwoman is not to be trifled with. During\nher talent test, the test stone tablet\nhad just started to react when the\ndirector and a few others mysteriously\ntook her away. Nobody knows her\nbackground, but I think she must have\ngotten at least an A, right? All Lord\ntalents below grade C, such as grades D\nand E, are revealed on the spot. The\npurpose is to discourage lord players\nwith low talent and ability. After all,\nthe battlefield of all races is not\nblind. Canon fodder will easily die\nthere, and alien races and alien species\nwill live to gain points and resources,\nthus strengthening others for no reason.\nIt can also improve the efficiency of\nresource coordination. After all, for\nentertainment lords below rank C, if\nit's really useful, such as the talent,\npeace, and prosperity, which increases\neveryone's recovery speed, they can\ndirectly find a strong player to rely\non. Talents of C rank and above can be\nmade public by the lord himself/\nherself. B- rank talents are already\nconsidered excellent talents and are\nconsidered the mainstay of the official\nserver. Rank A are the seated players,\nand all parties must protect them\nclosely to prevent lords from other\ndomains from intercepting them halfway.\nOnly someone like Dinglay, who likes to\nshow off, would have most people know\nthat he is an A. Dugu. Jaolon, the\neternal second place student at Jangdong\nnumber three middle school, possesses\nunparalleled intelligence and marshall\nprowess. Her family background is\nshrouded in mystery. Chufunga only knows\nthat her power surpasses her own and her\nlord level talent is absolutely no less\nthan her own. Only Lyn Sha would dare to\ndisregard her feelings and press down on\nher. Huh? It's pressing down on her\nhead. No, I mean you have to outdo her\nin every way. Oh my god. Just as\nChufinga was talking to herself, another\ncall came through on the communication\ninterface, startling her. Holy crap,\nit's my dad. Chufinga dared not not\nanswer. The moment the call connected,\nhe realized he had forgotten to wear a\nhat. His fiery red hair dazzlingly\nbright. Fongu, who is this red-haired\nguy who's with Lyn Sha? Chu Fongu, are\nyou asking for a beating? On the other\nend was a middle-aged man in a suit and\ntie, tall and with an extraordinary\ndemeanor. He was none other than Chu\nYusi, the city lord of JDong City. Red\nhair? What red hair? Dad, the light here\nisn't very good. It's the fire light\nthat's illuminating it. Chufinga changed\nthe subject. Fortunately, Chu Yusi was\nclearly in a hurry and didn't bother to\npursue the matter further. Getting\nstraight to the point, is Lynn Shia from\nthe same district as you? Yes, he's the\none who set the record. It really is\nhim. Shu Yusi breathed a sigh of relief\nand said, \"I just received a secret\nmessage from above. There's something\nstrange about Lin Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s matter. We\nneed to protect him carefully and\nobserve him for a period of time.\nStrange. Yes. The main god system said\nhe set a new record for the entire\nregion, but instead rewarded him with an\nextra hero. This has never happened\nbefore. Chu Yusi's expression was\nserious. The extra heroes are only\nawarded to the top three in the ninth\nheaven each year, as well as the record\nsetter in the blue star realm. Above the\nnovice zone is the Lon region. Above the\nLan region are the eight domains. The LN\nregion belongs to the Lshia domain.\nAbove the eight domains is the blue star\nrealm and the blue star realm belongs to\nthe ninth heaven. Upon hearing this\nnews, Chufinga's expression turns\nserious. Furthermore, Jabbron, the first\nprophet lord under the queen of dragon\nsummer domain, deduced that the demonic\ntide Lin Sha is facing this time is\nlikely to be between A level and S level\nin difficulty. His potential is\ndefinitely more than just frank. This is\nthe recognition of him by the main god\nsystem. The prophet lord believes that\nhe may grow into a powerful ranger lord\nwhich is a talent that our dragon summer\ndomain desperately needs. Therefore, the\nprophet lord wants to focus on\ncultivating him. But this demonic tide\nis exceptionally dangerous. Can Lyn Sha\nreally hold on? It should be fine,\nright? Hearing her father's analysis,\nChufinga suddenly became uncertain. He\nhas at least 20 phantom archers.\nImmediately, Chufinga told Chu Yusi\nabout what he had seen behind Lin Shiao,\nincluding the phantom archer, his\ndeductions, and how Lin Sha was the\nfirst to recruit a hero. \"Yes, he's got\npotential.\" Shu Yusi nodded. She faces\ndeath headon, fully utilizes her\ntalents, remains calm and decisive, and\nhas strong resilience. much better than\nmy brat ahem. In short, he's a promising\ntalent. Fungu, since he's your good\nfriend, you must help him if you have\nthe chance. Under Chu Funga&lt;unk&gt;s\nmournful gaze, Chu Yusi ended the\ncommunication, leaving behind a single\nsentence. If he survives this demonic\ntide, tell him he can contact me anytime\nif he needs anything. Chufinga shook her\nhead. Why is everyone looking for that\nkid? Lynn shouted. After saying that, he\nsuddenly noticed that the explosions in\nthe night sky outside had stopped and\nthe meteor shower had ceased. The\ndemonic tide has ended. He quickly\nlooked at Lyn Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s profile picture\nand breathed a sigh of relief. Lyn Shiao\nis still alive. Chapter 31. The true\nhidden hero. Baoi makes her debut. My\nlord, what are you doing? His weakened\nstate. Pay Min was radiant, clearly\nhaving benefited greatly from the battle\njust now. He had just returned to the\nLord&lt;unk&gt;'s mansion when he saw Lyn Sha\nbending down to fetch a bucket of water.\n\"Wash your hands. Open the treasure\nchest,\" Lyn Sha replied irritably.\nFeeling like he'd been tricked by the\nsystem, Lyn Sha decided to open all the\ntreasure chests and confirm all the\nrewards to feel more at ease. Otherwise,\nit's like the so-called beautiful\nheroine who has no shadow at all, but\neveryone in the district thinks she\ndoes. He has a beautiful female hero.\nWhere is she? He currently only has rare\nequipment. Horse slaying saber one.\nExcellent equipment. Birchwood longbow\none. Two excellent quality chests. Two\nepic quality chests and one golden\nlegendary chest. There's also the lance\nblec and blacksmith shop dropped by the\nbalro in the epic quality pool. Some of\nthese items are weapons which seem to be\nof good quality. The other two are\nauxiliary buildings that will greatly\nenhance the territory strength. The rare\nspear I brought from Lsha just happened\nto explode. So, I guess I can use a new\nspear to replace it, but I can't look at\nit right now. Enough talk. Let's open\nthe treasure chest. You have opened the\nobtained a scaled rock belt. Great.\nAnother piece in the set is complete.\nLiao's mood improved slightly. At this\npoint, only the helmet of the scale rock\nset is missing from the complete set.\nThe set bonus is already plus 20, and\nthe bonus will increase significantly\nonce the set is complete. I'm on a good\nday, so I'll open all the treasure\nchests in one go. You have opened the\nobtained a demon suppressing shield. You\nhave opened epic chest one and obtained\nepic recruitment token one. You have\nopened epic chest one and obtained one\npiece of falion. You have opened\nlegendary treasure chest one and\nobtained the blueprint for the special\nbuilding.\nDemon slaying shield fal Chinese tulu.\nThese names sound very high-end and\nsophisticated. Just as Lin Sha was\ntrying to confirm what good item he had\nobtained, a soldier outside the lord's\nmansion shouted, \"By the god of elves.\nNo, the supreme god. No, lord. We have\nfound your beautiful heroine. You have\nno manners. Lynsha was taken aback when\nSolderland's furious shout rang out\nbeside him. This is our lord. You must\nbe mindful of your rank. Soldering bowed\napologetically to Lyn Sha and said, \"I'm\nsorry, my lord. Elves live in the\nforest. Although they are an elegant\nrace, they don't really understand\nhierarchical order. I will go and\ninvestigate the situation now.\"\nSoldering then walked toward the gates\nof the territory. scolding his men as he\nwent. Who was making such a loud noise\njust now? Your uncultured attitude is a\ndisgrace to the elegance of our elven\nrace. Lyn Sha shook his head. The\nhandsome Saul basically managed his\nsubordinates by yelling. But the problem\nwas that he didn't even realize it and\nthought he was known for his elegance.\nSoldering&lt;unk&gt;s voice came from outside\nthe door. Miss, I'm sorry to have\nstartled you. I'll be loudly\nreprimanding my men in a moment. Please\nturn around. I will take you to see Holy\nShwats fact. Even the usually\nwell-mannered and handsome Saul became\nincoherent. My lord, Helen has arrived.\nLyn Sha shook his head again. It's all\nthe system announcement's fault. A\nbeautiful female hero is being awarded\nas a reward. Announcement to all\nservers. Even his subordinates all knew\nabout this and were all eagerly\nanticipating it. This group of strong\nmen, including his dozens of farmers,\nwere all male. highly loyal and\nworshiped him greatly. In just one day,\nthey started paying attention to the\nbeautiful heroins. As soon as the battle\nended, someone volunteered to search the\nbattlefield. Unexpectedly, they actually\nfound it. Since she's his beautiful\nheroine, why doesn't she come looking\nfor him instead of playing hideand seek\nwith him, showing off a true hidden\nhero? Does she act arrogant just because\nshe's beautiful? Lyn Shao began to feel\nsomewhat dissatisfied with this hero he\nhad never met. Someone as beautiful or\nnot is secondary. A true hero listens to\nhimself. After all, his goal was to\nsuccessfully enter the official Lan\ndistrict and become a top expert in the\nHasha domain. Living a carefree and\nunrestrained life in this other world,\nliving up to his identity as a\ntransmigrator. Lyn Sha would never let a\nwoman who wasn't on his side jeopardize\nhis important plans. While pondering,\nLynsha walked out the door and saw Saul\nLin and his group. Even Saul, who was\nincredibly handsome and had seen\ncountless beautiful elf women, stared\nblankly at a figure like a leerous man.\nLyn Sha followed Solderlands gaze. Then\nhe met his heroine. She was a woman who\nhid herself inside a large cloak. Now\nthat she had been found by the phantom\narcher, she had lowered the hood of her\ncloak, revealing her true appearance.\nSeeing the man the elves called their\nlord looking over the woman turned her\nface as well. Lyn Shia and he looked\ninto each other's eyes. It was a face of\nunparalleled beauty, both pure and\nethereal, yet alluring and seductive.\nHer long black hair cascaded down her\nback, and her face was fair and flawless\nas if sculpted from ice crystal. Her\nnose was soft yet straight. Her lips\nwere full and red, and when she blinked,\nher thick, interlaced eyelashes were\nlike a brush. If we're only talking\nabout her appearance, she's already\nabsolutely stunning. But the feeling she\nevokes is even more heartpounding. With\nhis experience of living two lives, at\nfirst glance, Lyn Sha thought she was a\ncharming and mature woman. At second\nglance, she seemed like a pure and\ninnocent young woman who could arouse a\nman's protective instincts. Upon closer\ninspection, she was just like the white\nmoonlight that you longed for in your\nyouth. Moreover, one can sense a charm\nemanating from her that is a blend of\ninnocence and allure. Her exquisitly\nbeautiful face always carried a hint of\nsorrow, making her appear pitiful to me,\nwhich that was the only thought that\npopped into Linia's mind. No wonder the\nphantom shooter was yelling. No wonder\nthe well-informed Sauling was so\nfrightened that he swore twice.\nSoldering even called her Helen, which\nis synonymous with the most beautiful\nwoman in the west, much like the little\ndragon girl in China. Fortunately, Lin\nSha had lived two lives and possessed\nthe Hasha token. So, he quickly regained\nhis senses. His gaze towards the woman\nimmediately transformed into pure\nadmiration and the subtle majesty of a\nlord looking at a hero. The woman was\nsomewhat surprised to see the young and\nhandsome lord behave in such a way.\nImmediately, a look of surprise appeared\non her face. She gently lifted the hem\nof her wide cloak and gracefully bowed\nto Lin Sha, revealing her snow white\nskin in the process. Your humble\nservant, Baoi, greets your lordship. Ba,\nBa, Baoi, one of the four infamous fim\nfatal in ancient China. The Baoi who is\nas famous as Sudaji. The Baoi who caused\nKing Yu of Zhao to light the beacon\nfires and play with the feudal lords. Is\nBa my reward hero? Lyn Sha was taken\naback. This Baoi was famous for her\nbeauty and was known for her bewitching\nnature. Was she his reward hero? What\ncould she do? Check Bao's attributes. Ba\nrace human ancient China. Quality level,\nlevel one. Attributes, strength, spirit,\nbody, soul. 99. Skills: Charm, Srank. A\nsmile worth a thousand pieces of gold. S\nrank. Beauty that could cause disaster.\nA rank. Stunning beauty. S rank. Inong\nreversal, S rank. Click to view. Main\ngod system hint. Suspected hidden skill.\nCombat power rating. Star. Exclusive\nunit. Songstress. this. Upon looking at\nit, Lin Sha was somewhat surprised. This\nis the second time Lin Sha has seen the\nmain god system marked with. The first\ntime was with the quality of the Hasha\ntoken which the god system used. The\nsecond time was with this stunningly\nbeautiful woman before us, capable of\ndriving any man mad. Her quality,\nattributes, and combat evaluation were\nall replaced with symbols. What does\nthis mean? Was Ba powerful or not? Look\nat her small, delicate frame. She seems\nfragile and can't withstand any\nhardship. Even at level one, his soul\nstat is as high as 99. He is definitely\nnot weak. And then there are her skills.\nFatal, allure, beauty that could topple\nkingdoms. These skill names don't sound\nlike positive or uplifting names. It\nseems like they're going to kill the\nlord. Chapter 32. The true beauty who\ncaused disaster. Baoi and Lin Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s\nimpulsiveness. Upon seeing Baoi's\nattribute panel and skills, Lin Shiao\nremained outwardly calm, maintaining his\nlordly dignity, but inwardly he was\nconstantly ranting. Oh God, I asked you\nto arrange female heroes for me. Not\nthis kind of fem fatal who could bring\nruin to the country. I thought Chin Yuan\nYuan and Lee sure were the limit. I\ncan't even imagine characters like Jiao\nChan and Daji appearing in nine out of\n10 online novels. My lord, won't you let\nme in? At this moment, Baoi spoke in a\ndelicate voice. Please come in. The\nnight is chilly, but I have some hot\nporridge here. Lyn Shia, being a\ngentleman, invited Baoi and led her into\nhis territory. Along the way, soldiers\nand farmers alike, as long as they were\nmale, would stand frozen in shock and\nlose their composure upon seeing Bao's\ntrue face. Is this the lord's beautiful\nheroine? No wonder the phantom archer\nrecognized her at first glance. A\nskilled archer muttered to himself. No\ndoubt about it. Natural beauty is hard\nto hide. If she's not a beauty, then who\nis? Beside him, a guard with a long\nsword also said, his eyes glazed over. I\nthink even Yong Guaye Feay, the\nconcubine of Emperor Schwanzong of Tang,\ncouldn't be more beautiful than this\nwoman. Shill, quiet. A young, dashing,\nand upright man walked over, seemingly\nunaffected, and reminded the Mo Dao iron\nguards and the divine arm archers. Miss\nBa is so beautiful. She might just be\nthe future lord's wife. Everyone, you\nshould be more respectful with your\nwords. Oh, there are no incompetent\nheroes. only incompetent lords. Lyn Shao\nkept reminding himself that no matter\nwhat kind of hero he was, he had his own\nplace to shine. Sitting by the fireplace\nin the open space in front of the lord's\nmanor, with his most loyal guards\nprotecting him just a few dozen meters\naway, Lyn Sha handed Baoi a bowl of hot\nporridge to help her recover some energy\nin the dead of night and then clicked to\nview Ba's skill attributes. Alluring\nSrank, she possesses endless charm,\nradiating an irresistible allure at all\ntimes. Increases attraction to the\nopposite sex by 300%. Increases\nattraction to the same sex by 200%,\nreduces hostility towards the opposite\nsex by 50% and increases hostility\ntowards the same sex by 100%. The first\nskill left Lynn Shiao speechless. A\nsuperkiller for straight men and a\nmaster at turning straight women gay.\nMoreover, the woman both loves and envys\nher, making it a truly tumultuous\nrelationship. A smile worth a thousand\npieces of gold. Level S. It is said that\nBao Ci rarely smiled. In order to see\nthe beauty smile, King Yu of Zhao spared\nno expense to buy her a smile and even\nlit the beacon fires to amuse the feudal\nlords. However, the story of lighting\nthe beacon fires to amuse the feudal\nlords does not exist. When Baoi smiled,\nher master could gain a certain benefit\nwhich was proportional to the degree of\nBao's happiness and multiplied based on\nthe overall economic strength of Bao's\nmaster. So this is what a smile worth a\nthousand pieces of gold means. As long\nas this woman smiles, I can make money.\nLynsha suddenly looked at Ba. Could this\nbeauty become his cash cow? But he's\nbeen a straight man in both his lives\nwith excellent luck with men but almost\nno luck with women. How can he make a\nbeauty of this caliber laugh? Lyn Shao\nshook his head and continued reading. A\nfem fatal level a because Baos's charm\nwas so outstanding. She was envied and\nrejected by the laws of heaven and\nearth. Constantly attracting hostility\nand misfortune from those around her\nwhich accumulated over time. When\nmisfortune accumulates to a certain\nextent, it will bring great disaster to\nthe area where Bao se is located,\nincluding but not limited to demonic\ntides, beast tides, earthquakes, fires,\ntsunamis, floods, extreme cold, extreme\nheat, foreign raids, assassinations,\ngenocide, national annihilation, and\nworld wars. What? Lyn Sha suddenly\nlooked up, his eyes fixed on Baoi. This\nbeautiful woman is such a jinx. We need\nto find a way to get rid of her.\nLynho&lt;unk&gt;s actions clearly startled\nBaoi, who was drinking porridge. With a\nloud crash, the bowl of porridge in\nBao's hand fell to the ground and\nshattered into several pieces. Lord,\nyour expression is terrifying. What did\nBa do wrong? Ba sat prostrate on the\nground, her fair arms covering her\nchest. Her eyes quickly welled up with\ntears, filled with resentment and\nlonging. Her sorrowful appearance could\ninstantly soften the heart of any man.\nLyn Shao stared at Baoi in silence for a\nfew seconds before slowly regaining his\ncomposure. Baoi brought misfortune to\nthe area she inhabited, not specifically\nto her master. Perhaps she could be sent\nelsewhere or used for. Moreover, this\nwas not her original intention. Hu Lin\nShia let out a long breath. If she\nreally is the kind of vixen who brings\ndisaster to the country and its people,\nI would rather be punished by the god\nsystem than let this hidden danger go\nunchecked. Sigh. Never mind. Let's look\nat the skills first. Peerless beauty\nsrank. Ba's stunning beauty greatly\nenhanced people's vanity. If Ba\nsuccessfully joins a territory and her\nloyalty to the Lord reaches 80 or\nhigher, all heroes, troops, peasants,\nand other creatures under that lord's\ncommand will feel deeply proud that the\nLord has such a beautiful\nwife/conubine/hero.\nWhen the conditions are met, all units\nin the territory will have an additional\n20% loyalty to the lord and an\nadditional 20% production efficiency. If\nthe city where Baoi is stationed is\nattacked by foreign enemies in order to\nprotect Bao, our units will have 100%\nincreased health and 100% increased\nmorale during wartime and will never\nretreat. Note, a secondary condition is\nthat Bao Ci must appear before her\nsubjects at intervals. Two elements\nreversal S level. A peerless beauty in\nprosperous times. A bewitching\nenchantress in chaotic times. Bowsy's\nluck value will fluctuate between minus\n100 and 100. If it stays at a positive\nor negative value for a long time, it\nwill lead the owner's luck to one side.\nIf Baoi were to encounter a prosperous\nand righteous ruler, she would\naccumulate more good fortune,\ncontinuously helping her master to\nobtain better luck and opportunities,\nultimately leading to the prosperity of\nthe nation. If Baoi were to encounter a\nchaotic and incompetent ruler, she would\nattract more misfortune, constantly\nweakening the master's fortune, and\nultimately bringing about a great\ncalamity. Therefore, Ba's special skills\ncannot be discarded, transferred, or\nmaliciously exploited by the Lord.\nOtherwise, it will directly lead to her\nultimate misfortune. Ba's current luck\nvalue minus 100. Lyn Sha Lyn Sha rubbed\nhis temples, feeling a deep headache.\nThe complex and confusing information\nforced him to close his eyes and use his\nbrain to find a solution. This Ba was\nforcibly given to me when the main god\nsystem malfunctioned. She didn't seem\naggressive at all, but it seems that her\nabilities are all at the rule level. Ba\ncan be described as a double-edged\nsword. If used well, she can defend the\ncity, become a cash cow, add icing on\nthe cake, and bring prosperity to the\ncountry. Moreover, to be honest, she was\nindeed the most beautiful woman Lynn\nShia had ever seen. Even as a pretty\nface, she was pleasing to the eye. If\nused improperly, the skill of a\nbeautiful woman attracting hostility and\nmisfortune is something no one can\ncounter. And then there's the negative\neffect of the two elements reversal. Who\ncan resist that? Lynn Shiao now suspects\nthat King Yu of Zhao lost the Western\nZhao dynasty and died because of this.\nCoincidentally, the category of fatal\nincludes the entry for a foreign rating.\nBut Baosi cannot be given away or\nabandoned. Her current luck value is as\nlow as minus 100 and she is almost\nentirely plagued by misfortune. What\nshould be done? Lynn Sha even doubted\nwhether his eternal peace and\nprosperity, establishing the heart of\nheaven and earth, which had increased\nhis lux several times over, could\nwithstand the misfortune brought by Ba.\nUltimately, why Ba? Why did the god\nsystem force Ba upon itself? Just as Lin\nSha closed his eyes and rubbed his\ntemples, a pair of warm, soft hands\ngently rested on his temples. Is the\nLord feeling unwell? A soft, fragrant\nbreeze came from behind him, and Bao's\nvoice like sweet wine, accompanied by\nthe fragrance exhaled from her mouth and\nnose, gently brushed against the back of\nLyn Xiao's neck. Before anyone knew it,\nBa, who had noticed Liao&lt;unk&gt;s anxiety,\nhad come up behind him, wrapped her arms\naround his back, and started massaging\nhis temples. Although she was wearing a\ncloak, her shapely curves and soft touch\nclung tightly to Linhao&lt;unk&gt;s back. Lyn\nShao suddenly opened his eyes. The next\nsecond, Lyn Sha, who had never been\nintimate with a woman before, suddenly\nstood up. \"Oh dear,\" Baosi exclaimed in\nsurprise, tripping over Lin Sha as he\nstood up. \"My lord,\" Lyn Sha then\nrealized his overreaction and quickly\nbent down to help Baoi up. \"Sorry, I\ndidn't react in time.\" He froze before\nhe could finish speaking. The sudden\nmovement had pulled at Bao's cloak,\ncausing her to fall to the ground where\nthe cloak slipped off. Beneath the wide\ncloak, Baosi was only wearing a snow\nwhite lace gauze undergarment. Her long,\nslender neck and most of her fragrant\nshoulders partially exposed, the\nshimmering light of her breasts faintly\nvisible. Lynho's throat bobbed, and he\nfelt his breathing become heavy. He\ninstinctively reached out and grabbed\nBaoi cloak and all and carried her into\nthe Lord&lt;unk&gt;'s mansion. Chapter 33. Pay\nmen's white moonlight, the forest\nwitch's cloak. Lynn Shiao carried Ba\ndirectly into the Lord's mansion. Having\njust survived a massive battle against\nthe demonic tide, the group emerged\nvictorious. It is a time when one's\nblood and energy are at their peak. It\nwas late at night when I encountered\nthis stunningly beautiful woman who\nthrew herself into my arms. The golden\nlegendary soldiers guarding Lin Xiao's\nside dozens of meters away were stunned.\nThen everyone showed expressions that\nsaid, \"Men understand a hymn. Miss Ba is\nindeed going to become the Lord's wife.\"\nA mo Dao iron guard whispered. Pay Min\nchuckled smugly, his expression carefree\nand forthright. A fine sword for a brave\nwarrior. A beautiful woman for a hero.\nNo, wait. Beautiful lady. They were a\nmatch made in heaven. It was just a\nnatural progression. After saying that,\nPayman secretly wiped away a bead of\nsweat. He was a hero in the profession.\nAnd he was afraid that if he quoted the\nancient Chinese proverb that a beautiful\nwoman should be paired with a hero, the\nLord might misunderstand and think that\nhe had any improper thoughts. Everyone\nnodded. Just now, our lord was merely\nsitting in front of the campfire\nchatting with the beautiful heroine for\na few moments. It only took a few\nminutes. The beautiful heroine smashed\nthe porridge bowl. Then he even pounced\non the lord and hugged him. Isn't this\njust like dry wood meeting a raging\nfire, igniting instantly upon contact?\nThe lord is young and handsome, dashing\nand extraordinary, yet kind to others.\nMiss Ba is stunningly beautiful and\ncaptivating, and she fell in love with\nthe Lord at first sight. She even went\nso far as to pursue and embrace him. No\nwonder the god system made a world\nannouncement, telling everyone that the\nLord has a beautiful heroine. This is a\nmarriage that everyone envys. The group\nof burly men stood in front of the\nbonfire in the open space of the square,\nguarding the lord's mansion from a\ndistance of several dozen meters. But\neach of them wore a strange maternal\nsmile. By the way, it seems that Miss Ba\nwas frightened and broke the bull just\nnow. The blonde blue-eyed Sdalin\nsuddenly said, \"He was an elf and an\narcher with excellent eyesight even at\nnight.\" After hearing the sound of the\nbull breaking, he glanced over and\nseemed to see Bao's frightened\nexpression. Soldering asked in\nconfusion, \"Sue, your archers have eagle\neyes. Their vision is better than ours.\"\nAs an elegant gentleman, it is my duty\nto inquire about the Lord&lt;unk&gt;'s\nwife&lt;unk&gt;'s condition. Did you clearly\nsee whether the Lord frightened Miss\nBaoi into breaking the bowl, or whether\nMiss Ba broke the bowl in her\nexcitement? S Ruer, a man of few words,\nhad his entire face buried under the\narmor with only his eyes showing. He\nsaid in a muffled voice, \"I didn't see\nit. Is there a difference?\" Soldering\npaused, unsure what to say. Ah, this is\nMiss Ba's brilliance, playing hard to\nget. Pay Min, who was standing to the\nside with his sword held to his chest,\nchimed in with admiration. In the end,\nit was all talk and no action. In the\nend, they were childhood sweethearts.\nThe fire light illuminated Pay Min's\nhandsome face, half of which was in\nshadow, highlighting his sharp features\nand undeniable dashing good looks like a\ndown on his luck wanderer. Soldering\npeaked his curiosity again and said,\n\"Mr. Payman, you seem to be least\naffected by Miss Ba. You are handsome\nand dashing, a man of exceptional\ntalent. How did you resist the charm of\nMiss Ba?\" Payman slowly raised his head\nand looked at soldering. It's very\nsimple. When you have someone in your\nheart, you'll find that of all the\nwaters in the world, only one is for\nyou. These men were all burly and\nfierce, capable of killing without\nbatting an eye. Despite being the most\ndisciplined and elite troops, they had\nlittle experience in this area and\nlooked eager to learn from the advice. I\nsee. Soldering looked enlightened and\ncontinued to ask. Mr. Payman, you are a\nman with a story. I'm very curious. What\nkind of beauty could attract you? Is she\na young beautiful girl, a chivalous\nfemale thief, a noble lady, or a noble\nwoman? We have many knights here, and\nthey all like noble women. As soon as\nthe question was raised, the group of\nmuscular men who had been distracted by\nthe affair between Lin Sha and Bao C\nturned around and stared intently at Pay\nMin. Aside from the lord, this swordsman\nwas the most handsome among them. His\nlong hair was tied back. His appearance\nwas gentle and refined. And his face was\nsharply defined, handsome and sunny. Yet\nhis expression always carried a hint of\nmelancholy and nonchulence, a masculine\ncharm that made other men envious.\nSoldering self was beautiful, but too\naffeminate, which didn't fit the\naesthetic of these tough guys. Pay Min\nlooked up at the sky, his expression\ndeep and thoughtful. She was the most\ndazzling moonlight of the Tang Dynasty.\nThe iron guards with their long swords\npricricked up their ears. She was a\ngoddess who could captivate you at first\nsight and leave you for life. At this\nmoment, even Song Rui turned his head,\nhis eyes shining brightly. Who is she?\nSoldering asked gracefully. She is\nGranny Gong Son. Tangg Yi, who was\nstanding to the side, couldn't help but\nspit it out. Big what What a\ngenerous gift. What you black bastard?\nThe elegant soldering&lt;unk&gt;s loud\nfoul-mouthed curses carried from afar.\nThe swearing reached the lord's manner,\nbut Lyn Sha clearly had no time to care\nwhy saw the Lynn was swearing. He\nbrought Baoi in. However, there were no\nsofas in the Lord&lt;unk&gt;'s mansion. It was\nentirely in the style of traditional\nChinese architecture. There was no other\nway but to put Baoi on the bed. Ba was\nso nervous that she dared not breathe,\nher whole body trembling slightly and\nher long eyelashes quivering as if she\nforesaw what was about to happen. No one\ncan resist her allure, even if it's not\nher intention. The young and handsome\nnew owner in front of them seemed to be\nthe same. Her face flushed and she\nclosed her eyes like a flower waiting to\nbe picked. Then Lyn Sha picked up a\ncloak and threw it at her face. Quick,\ntry them on. Baousi was taken aback when\nshe found herself holding a magnificent\ndeep red cloak. The Lord carried me in.\nIt turns out he just wanted to prevent\nothers from seeing my body and changed\nme into a new cloak. Have I\nmisunderstood you, Lord? A strange\nemotion welled up in Ba's heart. She\ncouldn't remember how many years it had\nbeen since she had felt this way.\nWhether it was from being touched,\nfeeling shy, or experiencing the\nsweetness of young love, Ba felt a lump\nin her throat. Is he the different kind\nof person? Just as he was lost in\nthought, Lyn Sha turned around and his\nvoice came. Hurry up and put on the\ncloak. I have something to ask you\nlater. Lyn Sha let out a breath. It was\ntoo dangerous. This vixen is too\ndangerous. He almost lost control of\nhimself. Fortunately, his mind honed by\ntwo lifetimes was strong enough. Upon\nseeing Ba's cloak, he remembered a piece\nof equipment. His first epic item.\nForest witch's cloak. Special quality\norange epic attributes base defense\nvalue 365.\nSpecial abilities invisibility rank A.\nSpecial attribute exclusively for\nfemales. Wearing this item by any other\ngender will not grant the special\nability. Description. A cloak of unknown\norigin said to have been made by Alice.\nthe strongest witch in the elf forest.\nIts elegant and beautiful design can\nattract the attention of all women at a\nglance, making it more suitable for\nwomen. Stealth skill is simply\ninvisibility. It's an A-level stealth\nskill. Without a detection skill of a\nlevel or higher, the user cannot be\ndetected. The key point is this.\nConcealment rank A skill. Concealment\nrank A can block any skill of the wearer\nof rank A or below. can block the\nwearer's aura, making the wearer\nundetectable, unlocatable, and\nuncarchable by specific skills. At\nfirst, Lyn Shao thought it was a cloak\nexclusively for female assassins. But\nnow he realized that it was a perfect\nmatch for Baoi. Her fem fatal skill,\nwhich is specifically designed to bring\nmisfortune to her master, is it not only\na level? This problem will be solved\nonce you put on the forest witch's\ncloak. When Baoi saw Lin Shiao turn\naround, she blushed and changed into a\nnew cloak. As she put it on, her eyes\nremained fixed on Lin Shiao. She didn't\nunderstand Lin Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s intentions,\nbut his unusual behavior alone was\nenough to peique her curiosity. Put it\non, my lord. Ba's timid voice came from\nbehind, and Lin Shao finally turned\naround. A peerless beauty in a gorgeous\nred cloak with snow white skin, black\nsilk cascading down her back, eyes like\nstars, and her embroidered lips slightly\nparted, shy as a flower, made Lin\nXiao&lt;unk&gt;s banners sway. But Liao&lt;unk&gt;s\nnext words caused Bao's mind to explode\nas if struck by lightning. How does it\nfeel? Don't you feel like all the bad\nluck surrounding you has disappeared?\nChapter 34. Ba. I was born to be a\nconcubine. How does it feel? Don't you\nfeel like all your bad luck has\ndisappeared? Lynhiao&lt;unk&gt;s gentle voice\nsuddenly sounded like thunder in Bao's\nears, causing her to lose her composure\nfor a moment. When she came to her\nsenses, she suddenly looked at her lord.\nWhat I saw was a pair of gentle and\npeaceful eyes. My lord, he he knows my\nsecret. He knows everything. He looked\nat me by the fireplace just now was so\nterrifying. Did he know my secret? and\nhis troubled expression afterwards was\nall because he was trying to find a\nsolution for me. Then he carried me back\nand gave me this cloak. Ba's heart was\npounding. Her thoughts were in turmoil\nand she sat blankly on the bed. What's\nwrong? Lyn Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s gentle voice came\nagain, startling Baoi awake. She quickly\nsat up straight and closed her eyes. In\njust a few seconds, Bao's long eyelashes\nwere already wet and her body began to\ntremble. She opened her eyes, which were\nfilled with mist. My lord, your bad luck\nis gone. Ba couldn't help but be happy,\nfor the misfortune that had followed her\nlike a shadow had suddenly disappeared.\nIn an instant, she felt much more\nrelaxed. Then, Ba lowered her head and\nbegan to sob softly. She poured out all\nher grievances and the tragic\nexperiences she had endured due to the\nmisfortunes that had surrounded her over\nthe years, turning them into tears.\nFinally, finally, I don't have to bear\nthis heavy fade anymore. After crying\nfor a while, Ba remembered that her lord\nwas still beside her and quickly\ncomposed herself. Lyn Shao patiently\nwaited for Baoi to adjust her mood,\nwhich made him even more certain that\nBaoi was nothing more than a fim fatal\nforced into this situation. Very good.\nSeeing that Baoi had calmed down, Lin\nXiao nodded happily. This cloak is\nyours. Wear it well. Seeing Lin\nXiao&lt;unk&gt;s concerned gaze and\noverflowing joy, Baoi felt another wave\nof emotion. He truly cared about me. He\ngave me the cloak, knew my secret, and\nstayed by my side and even worried about\nme. Ba's secret passage. Ding! Your hero\nBa's loyalty has reached 70%. Feelings\nhave begun to blossom due to the\ntriggered loyalty boost. Ba sees two\nelements reversal. Luck value has now\nincreased to minus 95. Lyn Sha was\nslightly taken aback. Does this increase\nloyalty? But the initial loyalty is too\nlow. You know, your own talent can\nincrease loyalty by 20% and Baoi is your\nown hero. Yet, Baosi only has 70 loyalty\nafter triggering the boost. That means\nthe initial score might only be 60. If\nshe were an ordinary lord, Baoi might\nonly have 50 points of loyalty. Who\ncould stand such a bewitching heroine?\nLyn Sha completely ignored what the\nsudden feelings following the 70 points\nof loyalty meant. He continued to\nponder. However, the increase in luck\nvalue is good news. I was just worried\nabout how to solve this big problem. It\nseems that I need to do more strategy\nand cultivate Bao's loyalty in the\nfuture. Seeing this, Lyn Sha pulled over\na stool and sat down in front of the\nbed. Baoi, may I tell you your story?\nLyn Shaol looked into Ba's eyes and\nsaid, \"Why were you forcibly given to me\nby the god system? And why did you hide\nand only get found by my people after\nthe demonic tide? I am your lord. You\ncan be honest with me, and I will help\nyou solve your problems.\" Still immersed\nin the emotion and relief after the\nmisfortune was over, Ba slowly raised\nher head upon hearing this. sitting on\nthe lord's bed with the handsome lord\nright in front of her wielding a large\nsword and riding a golden horse. Bousi\nblushed and her heart raced again. She\nlowered her head again and whispered. My\nlord has shown me great kindness and I\nwill certainly tell you everything I\nknow without reservation. Wait. Lynsha\nsuddenly raised his hand to interrupt.\nWhy do you always refer to yourself as\nthis concubine? Just use your real name\nor me. all this this concubine stuff.\nAre you here to be my wife? Ba was taken\naback and stammered. I came here to be a\nlord. Ba suddenly realized what was\nhappening, covered her face with her\nhands, and was too ashamed to look at\nanyone. Lyn Sha, I feel like my clueless\nstraight man like remarks have made me\nall alone. Ahem, let's continue. It is\nI, your humble servant. I am actually of\nChinese descent, and so is your\nexcellency, sir. Lynn Sha nodded. \"When\nI arrived in this strange world, I\ndiscovered that there were no Chinese\npeople here. I dared not come out, so I\nhid outside the demonic tide. But after\nseeing the Lord's soldiers and\nswordsmen, he dared to come out and\nacknowledge them.\" Lyn Sha found it a\nbit strange. The troops in this\nbattlefield of 10,000 races were all\nfrom Western games. orcs, goblins,\ncenttors, elves, monsters, zombies,\nangels, demons, dragons, and the like.\nThere were no Chinese people, but many\nlords in this other world were from Lia.\nThe territory of Liao was similar to\nthat of China, and the people of Liao\nwere all of yellow race, spoke Chinese,\nwrote Chinese characters, and pasted\nspring festival couplets. Besides not\nwatching the spring festival gala,\nmaking dumplings, or studying history\nduring Chinese New Year, it's pretty\nmuch the same. So why is Ba so\nconcerned? But he did not interrupt Ba,\nsignaling her to continue. I am from the\nstate of Bao during the Zhao dynasty.\nSince childhood, I have been able to\nattract attention by causing unusual\nphenomena in the heavens and earth. But\nit also brought endless misfortune to\nthe family and relatives around him.\nWhen he was young, both of his parents\ndied tragically. Someone saw that I was\nbeautiful and raised me. He intended to\ntake me as his concubine, but he met\nwith misfortune after only one year.\nLater, someone took them in, but within\n3 years, their family was destroyed and\nthey died. When I was young, I was\nalready stunningly beautiful and I\nalways managed to find someone to take\nme in. Although they were all lustful\nand wanted to take me as a concubine\nwhen I grew up, none of them lasted more\nthan a year or two. I was once again\nleft to wander the streets and was taken\nin by someone again. This time the\nperson was a doctor, a nobleman. The\ndoctor consulted a diver who determined\nthat my fortune was abnormal and could\nonly be suppressed by someone with\nexceptionally strong fortune. Therefore,\nhe presented me to the Zhao Emperor.\nKing Yu of Zhao, Lin Shao thought to\nhimself. But he was a postumous title\ngiven by later generations. So it was\nnormal for Baoi to only call him the son\nof heaven. Emperor Ji Gonging fell\ndeeply in love with me at first sight.\nBut he was no ordinary person either. He\nsaw that my luck was extraordinary and\nasked the imperial adviser to tell my\nfortune. The imperial adviser foresaw\nthat I was born with an inescapable\ncurse. If I were to remain by his side,\nit would even overwhelm the nation's\nfortunes, causing disaster and leading\nto the nation's destruction and the\ndeaths of its people. The Imperial\nPreceptor intended to sacrifice his own\ncentury of cultivation to forcibly kill\nme, but was stopped by the Zhao Emperor.\nAt that time, he was already bewitched\nby me and could not resist my charm.\nBowsi lowered her head, her voice\ngrowing softer and softer, seemingly\nfilled with remorse. My lord, bewitching\nthe emperor was not my intention. I\nunderstand. You don't need to worry.\nLynn Xiaoing&lt;unk&gt;s calm voice once again\ngave this stunningly beautiful woman\nstrength. She paused, then continued.\nLater, the Zhao Emperor widely recruited\nalchemists from all over the country to\nseek a way to dispel misfortune. After\nexamining my face, an alchemist devised\na plan. As long as I can laugh, bad luck\nwill gradually dissipate. This is how\nthe story of the princes playing with\nthe beacon fire came about. Lyn Sha\nraised an eyebrow and listened patiently\nas Baoi continued. But I lost my family\nat a young age and wandered the world.\nAll I have seen is sorrow and separation\nand the tragic things that happened to\npeople and everyone who was with me has\nmet with misfortune. I really can't\nlaugh anymore. Ba raised her head and\nlooked at Lynsha. Her eyes were like\nstars and spring water, indescribably\nmoving and alluring. Yet her delicate\nbrows were slightly furrowed, always\ncarrying a trace of sorrow. The Zhao\nEmperor tried every means to win a smile\nfrom his concubine. The emperor said\nthat he would not take me as a concubine\nuntil I smiled. I understand the good\nintentions of the Zhao Emperor, but some\nthings cannot be forced. The emperor has\nalso exhausted his time in trying\nvarious methods and the Zhao dynasty's\nnational fortune has also been exhausted\nand the country's power is declining\nmore and more. A year later the Chuanong\nattacked and killed the Zhao Emperor Ji\nGong Shang. I was also captured. The\nChuan people were extremely unlucky.\nThey were ambushed and killed by the\nChong people on the way. I died in the\nchaos of the battle. Ba fell silent. Her\nshoulders trembled and she began to sob\nsoftly again. Lyn Sha also fell silent.\nWhat a poignant scene that left men\nspeechless and women in tears.\nLet's&lt;unk&gt; not worry about how Baoi came\nback to life after dying or how old Ba\nwas in the Zhao dynasty. At this moment,\none should sit down next to the beauty,\ngently lift her hand, care for her, and\ncomfort her. With the beauty in one's\narms, the good time will not be wasted.\nLyn Sha was moved and his body was also\nrestless. His heart was racing and he\nunconsciously sat on Ba's bed. At this\npoint, who cares about anything else?\nYou have to let your body take control\nof you. Obedience to the body. Then\nwhat? Lynch asked. Even top students are\nultimately driven by their own\ninquisitive minds, the most advanced\nbodily organs. Chapter 35. What kind of\nfor fluid was administered? Nights I\nmiss you. Lynn Shao was more interested\nin Bao's story than Baoi herself and the\nfundamental reason for this was that Lyn\nSha desperately wanted to find out Bao's\nidentity and why she had been brought\nback to life. Where did their own\nChinese military force come from? What\nrole does his own Hasha token play in\nall of this? I'd like to know even more\nwhy the main god forced Ba upon him and\nwhat his intention was. Why was the\ngod's reward system so chaotic before?\nBaoi could not possibly know everything,\nbut even knowing only some of it would\nbe helpful to Lynn Xiao's judgment. As a\nclear-headed and goal-oriented person,\nLyn Xiao's goal has always been to\nbecome a superior person in this world.\nTo make this life worthwhile, one woman\nwill not be his final destination\nbecause he doesn't want to be\nmanipulated or led by the nose. So\nalthough the handsome, straight-laced,\nacademically gifted lord sat next to the\nstunningly beautiful woman, his eyes\nfixed on her, his heart was filled with\na thirst for knowledge. Ba glanced at\nLyn Sha, seemingly both disappointed and\nrelieved. Her face, both ethereal and\nalluring, held a touch of shyness,\nmaking her even more captivating in the\nnight. Later, my consciousness did not\ndisappear. Instead, it drifted to an\nunknown place. It looked like a dream\nwith no sense of direction, no sun,\nmoon, or stars in the sky, and no\nmountains or rivers on the ground. There\nwere buildings and pavilions there, and\nthere were many people dressed in black.\n\"A person dressed in black?\" Lyn Sha\nasked curiously. \"Yes, that's right.\nThey were dressed in black and shrouded\nin black mist. They were quite surprised\nto see me. Some people in the black mist\ndiscovered that I could attract bad\nluck. They cast spells on me, saying\nthey wanted to heal me and help me break\nfree from the bad luck that has plagued\nme for thousands of years, but it had no\neffect. During the spellcasting, I was\nalso passively instilled with 5,000\nyears of Chinese history by the magic,\nonly to find out that my reputation was\nso bad. At this point, Baoi was on the\nverge of tears. Lyn Sha breathed a sigh\nof relief. How could this be blamed on\nBaoi? Throughout history, it was mostly\nthe emperor&lt;unk&gt;'s inaction that led to\nthe national crisis being pushed onto a\nweak woman. He reached out and gently\npatted Ba's shoulder. Don't worry about\nit. I treat all my people the same. Ba\nblushed, feeling a strange flutter in\nher heart, unsure whether it was from\nLin Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s actions or his words.\nIt's&lt;unk&gt; hard to imagine that such a\nfamously beautiful enchantress could be\nso easily shy after opening her heart.\nLater, the men in black's attempt\nfailed, and they temporarily sealed me\naway. In my hazy state, I heard them say\nthat the effects of the misfortune on me\nare becoming more and more obvious, and\nthey can no longer suppress it. If this\ncontinues, the misfortune will manifest\nitself and bring them even greater\ncalamity. They are already in a state of\ndisaster, hiding in the cracks of the\nworld, and are no longer able to bear my\nmisfortune. In the end, I was sealed\naway until recently when I awoke and was\nsent to this world. A voice told me that\nI should become the Lord's little\nservant. By the end, Ba's voice had\nbecome so faint as to be barely audible.\nBe my underling. Lynn Sha chuckled. All\nthe soldiers, farmers, and heroes in my\nterritory are my underlings. Don't be\nshy. Make yourself at home, and let's\nbuild a great future together. Ba was\nstunned. Her beautiful mouth slightly\nopen, her eyes almost overflowing with\ntears. It was hard to tell whether she\nwas disappointed or speechless. How can\nthis lord be so oblivious to romance? Ba\nlooked up and met Liao&lt;unk&gt;s eyes, only\nto see Lin Shiao staring at her with a\nhalf smile, a sly smile on his lips. Oh.\nBaoi reacted instantly, collapsing to\nthe side of the bed, too ashamed to look\nat anyone. The Lord has already\nunderstood what she meant. He was just\nteasing her. Lyn Xiao&lt;unk&gt;so&lt;unk&gt;s voice\ncame. Ba, when I released you, who was\nthat voice in your ear? Was it the\nSupreme God? Ba shook her head. I do not\nknow. I have never heard the voice of\nthe chief god. I only feel that my voice\nsounds very similar to one of the men in\nblack. Who exactly is that man in black?\nLyn Sha murmured to himself. They\nclaimed to be ancient demons. Ancient\ndemons? An unheard of race? Lyn Sha\nshook his head. This name is just too\nridiculous. Is it that kind of ancient\ndemon that laughs with a rockus cackling\nlaugh? Why were the ancient demons so\nafraid of Bao's fatal fate? Lyn Shall\nput these things aside for the time\nbeing. He had a basic understanding of\nBao's past, but the questions still\nremained unanswered. Ba herself was\nunaware of this. Bao sees fatal effect\nhas been temporarily controlled, but her\nInyong reversal effect is still at minus\n95. How should we deal with it? Thinking\nof this, Lyn Shao asked, \"Your\nmisfortune has been stopped by the\ncloak. Without the accumulation of\nmisfortune, the situation is temporarily\nunder control. But your luck is still in\na very dangerous state. Do you know how\nto increase your luck value?\" Ba\nlaughing. Lyn Sha, Lyn Sha, Then give me\na smile, Ba. But I really can't laugh\nbecause Baoi was protected from\nmisfortune. The fatal effect no longer\nactivated. The gloom between her brows\nhad dissipated considerably. Her red\nlips were slightly parted, and her\ndelicate eyebrows were slightly\nfurrowed, giving her a pitiful\nappearance. But she spent her life in\nmisery and displacement, almost never\nlaughing, and had forgotten what it felt\nlike to laugh. \"Perhaps we should try to\nsee if Ba sees laughter has any effect,\nand then we can find a way to deal with\nher negative skills,\" Lyn Sha thought to\nhimself. Immediately, Lyn Sha froze. \"In\nhis previous life, he was of average\nappearance, a typical straight man, and\nhad never been in a relationship. In\nthis life, although I was born with an\nincredibly handsome face as an orphan,\nall I wanted to do was live a good life\nand make a name for myself. I never even\nhad a romantic relationship. How does he\nknow how to make girls happy? After\nthinking it over, Lyn Sha decided to\ntell Baoi a joke first. The deer got\nlost in the forest, so it called its\ngood friend, the giraffe. Hello, I'm\nlost. Giraffe? Yes, I'm a giraffe. Ba\nwrinkled her pretty nose and looked at\nLin Shia with a puzzled expression. My\nlord, what is a telephone? Why do we\nneed to call it a hem? Forget about\nthat. Let's change the joke. Lyn Sha\ntouched his nose and continued. In a\ncertain place, there lived a wealthy man\nsurnamed Hang. He was young and rich and\nwas the son of the richest man in China.\nThis young man roams freely among the\nflowers, surrounded by beauties, singing\nand dancing every night. living a life\nof great pleasure. But she coveted the\nson's surnamed female internet celebrity\nuh the actress you. This woman looks\ndown on the young master surnamed Huang\nand keeps him at arms length. Yet he is\ninfatuated with her and can't help but\nshower her with concern and good morning\nand goodn night greetings. One day the\nyoung master surnamed Huang caught a\nslight cold and needed to see a doctor\nfor an for drip. Before leaving, the\nyoung master Wong asked someone to pass\non a message to the female entertainer.\nDo you know what message he passed on?\nWhat are you saying? Ba was completely\ncaptivated by the story, her big eyes\nsparkling as she stared intently at her\nlord, waiting for what would happen\nnext. Lyn Sha paused for a moment, then\nspoke slowly in a deep, magnetic voice.\nHoney, I'm going to get him for drip.\nWhat kind of for drip? The night I miss\nyou. Bowsi couldn't help but spit it\nout, then giggled uncontrollably. How\ncould there be such a ridiculous man?\nAlthough ridiculous, he's also somewhat\nendearing. Huh? Lyn Sha laughed as well.\nDon't you think this young master Hang\nis as cute as an animal? Does it\nresemble? S.\nHuh? Ba laughed so hard she bent over,\ntears streaming down her face. Amidst\nthe trembling of her body, a fragrant\nbreeze reached Lin Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s nose,\nmaking his banners flutter. Haha, the\nterm simp is truly brilliant. Who came\nup with this term? Haha. Ba's charming\nlaughter even seemed to have a thud, and\nLyn Sha seemed to hear other women's\nlaughter as well, just as he was\nwondering. Ding! You have successfully\nmade Baoi smile. A smile worth a,000\ngold activated. You have received 13,594\ngold coins. Ding. Because you improved\nBao's mood and made her smile. Your hero\nBa's loyalty has increased to 80. Love\nat first sight. Ding. Due to the\ntriggering of a loyalty boost. Ba sees\ntwo elements reversal. Luck value has\nnow increased to minus 90. Ding. Due to\ntriggering the ismile worth a thousand\npieces of gold effect. Bow sees two\nelements reversal. Luck value has\nincreased to minus 88. Chapter 36. My\nhumble servant attends to the Lord in\nhis bedtime. Lyn Sha was finally able to\nbreathe a sigh of relief. From the\ndiscovery of Baoi until now, only a\nshort hour has passed. He was finally\nable to figure out Bao's background and\ntake targeted measures against her\nskills, blocking her fatal ability,\nremoving her inner turmoil and letting\nher lower her guard. He then used a\njoke, or maybe it was a joke. Lynn Sha\nwasn't sure to trigger a smile worth a\nthousand pieces of gold and found a way\nto reduce Bao C's negative luck value of\ntwo elements reversal, successfully\nraising her luck value to minus 88 while\nalso increasing her loyalty to 80\npoints. Love at first sight. From then\non, this stunning beauty was no longer a\nticking time bomb in his territory and\nher positive skills could be used, which\nwas a great help to his territory. Hm.\nWhat's this love at first sight thing?\nIt sounds a bit like some kind of\nJapanese game setting. The female heroes\nand male soldiers are set up\ndifferently. The male heroes 80 points\nare called as easy as using an arm. Does\nthis mean that female heroes can have\nsome deeper conversations? Lyn Sha\nlooked suspiciously at the beautiful\nwoman sitting next to him who had opened\nher heart. Her pretty face was slightly\nflushed because of her longlost cheerful\nsmile, and her eyes sparkled like stars.\nsometimes bewitching and sometimes pure.\nCombined with her snow white skin, her\ndefenseless demeanor was truly\nirresistible. She was sitting next to\nLynn Shia, her eyes half closed, leaning\nslightly against him. She didn't say a\nword, but her gesture spoke volumes. If\n80 points of loyalty is called love at\nfirst sight, what do you call 100 points\nof loyalty? Doing whatever you want. He\nlook at Ba. She hasn't been happy in a\nlong time. Let her relax first. If I\nremember correctly, I got quite a few\ngood items this time while resisting the\ndemonic tide. Let's check their\nattributes first. Use the ones we can\nuse. Give them to our subordinates and\nput the junk or unwanted ones up for\nauction. Lynn Sha never waste time. So,\nhe immediately got to work. God, check\nall my equipment. Of the myriad races\nimmediately and faithfully fulfilled its\nduty, displaying one piece of equipment\nafter another. Yu long bow, excellent\nweapon. Click to view. Black long sword,\nrare weapon on auction. Fatal strike\nbow, rare weapon. Attack claws, rare\nweapon. Dance of fine snow, rare weapon.\nHorse slaying saber, rare weapon, click\nto view. Life amulet, superior\nequipment. Demon suppressing shield,\nexcellent equipment, click to view.\nScale rock shoulder pads, scale rock\nbreastplate, scale rock belt, scale rock\nleggings, purple excellent set for\nfifths complete. Knight's lance lilac\nepic weapon click to view. Falion epic\nweapon click to view. Forest witch's\ncloak epic equipment. Your hero BC is\nwearing it. Bold text can be removed.\nSpecial. One blacksmith shop. One epic\nquality pond. One epic quality\nrecruitment token. one gold legendary\nquality Hashia Tulu construction\nblueprint. I never imagined that I would\naccumulate so much equipment on just my\nfirst day in the battle of the myriad\nraces. Lyn Shia was also a little\nstunned. Although he had expected it, he\nwas still slightly shocked by his gains\nafter listing all the equipment. There\nis an old Chinese saying, \"The tallest\ntree in the forest will be felled by the\nwind. My unlucky fate may attract\nunnecessary attention or even\nassassination attempts when I am still\nweak. However, with Ba by my side now,\nwhether by coincidence or not, her\ncurrent negative luck from the two\nelements reversal should have largely\noffset my eternal peace and prosperity\nfor the people. There probably won't be\nany more big explosions like this in the\nfuture. We'll have to take it one step\nat a time. Lynn Shiao analyzed himself\nfor a moment and subconsciously found a\nsuitable reason for his stunning beauty.\nUnbeknownst to him, Baosi's allure had\nsubtly influenced him, leading Lin Shiao\nto regard her as a heroine he had to\nprotect. This god system is quite\nintelligent. For all the equipment I\nhaven't seen before, there's a click to\nview button next to them. Let me check\nout the equipment one by one. First up\nis the Birch Longbow. A highquality\npiece of equipment with a base attack\nbonus of 100. There's really not much to\nsay about it. Just put it up for\nauction. Soldering wouldn't even\nconsider it. The deadly bow is good. We\ncan keep it for soldering. As for Song\nRu and the others, they'll probably need\nbetter bows to match. Attack claw, an\nassassin's weapon. I don't have an\nassassin myself, and Pay Min probably\nwouldn't wear this anyway, so I'll sell\nit. The dance of fine snow is a decent\nweapon and it looks pretty cool. We can\nlet Pay Min try it out. If he's willing,\nit'll be his. Pay Min possesses the\nskill sword of all things. So, he can\nuse a katana as a sword as well.\nHowever, when I was looking at the\nequipment just now, I thought there was\na Falian epic weapon that was also a\nsword. I'll take a look at it later and\nthen decide whether to keep it or not.\nHorse slaying saber. A rare piece of\nequipment with powerful attributes. base\nattack power 300 plus 20 strength. It's\nover 3 m long with the blade being over\na meter long similar to a Modo Dao.\nLet's just give it to Tang Yi. After\narranging the weapons and equipment\nabove, Lin Shiao continued looking down.\nThe life amulet is a good piece of\nequipment. It can speed up the recovery\nof health and increase stamina by 30,\nwhich is equivalent to giving a tanky\ncharacter a free boost of health. I'll\nwear this myself so I don't get killed\nin the early game. The scale rock heavy\narmor set excluding base defense adds 15\nor 10 points to strength and\nconstitution with each piece for a total\nof 50 points. The set bonus adds 20\npoints to strength and constitution for\na total of 70 points. It's like directly\nadding the attributes of Tang Yi, a\nlevel seven iron guard with over 60\nstars in combat power to yourself.\nAccording to Linhao's memory of studying\nthe dictionary of equipment for all\nraces, if all five pieces are collected,\nthe attributes of the scale rock set\nwill increase. Good stuff. I'll wear it\nmyself. It increases defense, strength,\nand constitution. Better safe than\nsorry. Magic shield. A rare piece of\nequipment that can withstand one magic\nattack of no more than epic level every\nday. Suitable for daily wear. Grants\nplus 10 soul points. a standard shield\nmainly for defense against magic. It was\nable to withstand one of the fire demons\nattacks earlier. It can be useful if\nused properly, so I'll keep it for now.\nNext up are the two main weapons. These\nare also Lyn Xiao's first and second\nepic weapons. Knight's Lance Bryan epic\nweapon quality orange epic. Attributes:\nbase attack power 580, strength + 20,\nspirit plus 20, soul + 20, constitution\nminus 10. Special attributes increases\ncritical hit chance by 20%. Can be\nthrown to kill enemies. Range is\npositively correlated with the master's\nstrength. Automatically returns to the\nmaster's hand after being thrown. Can\nemit light for illumination.\nIntroduction. This is the most famous\nspear on the continent of Trius. Brianac\nis a renowned magic spear of the Danu\nrace. Wielded by Lug Mack Eselin, the\ngod of light and sun. Its name means\npiercing. This spear can unleash a\ndeadly light no matter how distant the\nenemy. Brianac is a living magic spear\nconstantly thirsting for blood. Falion\nepic weapon quality orange epic lord\nexclusive. Attributes: base attack power\n600, strength plus 25, spirit plus 25.\nSpecial attribute effective against\ndragons and evil gods. Increases damage\nagainst dragons by 50% and damage\nagainst evil gods by 10%. Description:\nOne of the holy swords of the continent\nof Trius, made of dragon bone. Legend\nhas it that it was the sword of the hero\nking Mars, born from the flame emblem.\nBecause it is made of dragon bone, it\nhas a special effect against dragons,\nbut it is also easy to arouse the\nhostility of dragons. A holy sword and a\ndemonic spear both are quite good.\nHowever, Falshin can only be used by\nlords. So, all that's left for pay men\nis dance of fine snow. Lyn Sha himself\nhas full weapon control and can use any\nweapon. He decided to use these two\nweapons. A long spear for range and a\nlong sword with even higher attack power\nthan the spear. Having finally finished\nlooking at all his equipment, Lyn Sha\nwas about to examine his golden\nlegendary item when a soft, boneless\nwhisper beside him interrupted his\nthoughts. Ba, seemingly snapping out of\nher days, said in a barely audible\nvoice, \"My lord, it's getting late. This\nhumble servant will attend to you as you\nprepare for bed. Chapter 37. My lord,\nplease submit to me. Lyn Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s\nbreathing immediately became heavy\nagain. No matter how many lifetimes he\nhad lived, he couldn't resist the\nrepeated teasing of such a stunningly\nbeautiful enchantress. Besides, this\nenchantress seems to be sincere. I don't\ncare about your graceful figure. I only\nknow that you're just playing around.\nBut what I fear most is that you, a\nseasoned player in the game of love,\nhave fallen in love with someone real.\nThe god systems evaluation of love at\nfirst sight is genuine. Lynsha suddenly\nturned around and looked at Baoi, who\nhad just lowered her head to the ground.\nFeeling the Lord&lt;unk&gt;'s burning gaze, Ba\nslowly raised her face, shily but\nfearlessly, meeting Lyn Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s eyes.\nMy lord, I, Baoi, will serve you in bed.\nSeeing that Lin Sha hadn't responded and\nwas only staring at her, Ba repeated her\nwords, saying again, \"That mysterious\nvoice said that Baoi's life was entirely\nin the hands of the Lord. If Ba could\nsurvive, let Baoi become your concubine,\nLord, to assist you in achieving your\nambitions of conquest. It's past\nmidnight now. Your highness should rest\nas soon as possible to conserve your\nenergy and continue your quest for\nglory. Late at night inside the lord's\nmanor, Bai had somehow removed her\nforest witch's cloak. Her long flowing\nblack hair cascaded down her back, and\nher skin, fair and flawless, as if\nsculpted from ice crystal, radiated a\ncaptivating charm that blended innocence\nand allure. Does your majesty feel that\nBa, having been wandered to many places\nand being the consort of the Zhao\nemperor, is no longer worthy of you?\nBousy bit her red lips lightly, her\nhands resting on the drawstring of her\nsnow white lace undergarment. Her next\nmove was obvious. She said with tears\nwelling up in her eyes, \"My lord, no one\ncan win a smile from Baoi.\" Therefore,\nBaoi was still a virgin. My lord\nprotected Baoi from misfortune by\ntelling her jokes, and Ba has never been\nso happy. My lord, you must be the right\none. Baoi dared not hope to become the\nLord&lt;unk&gt;'s wife. As long as she could\nstay by the lord's side and become the\nlord&lt;unk&gt;'s woman, Baoi would be very\nsatisfied. My lord, please submit to my\nwill. Ding. Your hero Ba has revealed\nher true feelings and her loyalty has\nincreased to 90%. She can do whatever\nshe wants. Okay, now the evaluation of\nthe main god system is pretty clear.\nEveryone knows what they can do now. A\nstunning beauty. She even directly\nrevealed secrets that women in ancient\ntimes would never dare to speak of,\nexpressing her true feelings and making\nsuch a voluntary sacrifice. At this\nmoment, it would be a real disservice to\nthe body that Lyn Sha, the steel-willed\nstraight man, had honed over many years\nif he didn't do something. Liao&lt;unk&gt;s\nbody moved involuntarily. At this\nmoment, part of his body, his brain, was\nworking at lightning speed. At first, he\nnever imagined that he would have to say\ngoodbye to being single on his very\nfirst day on the battlefield of the\nmyriad races of all races remains high\nand many lords believe in living for the\nmoment. Therefore, it is quite normal\nfor things to happen between lords and\nheroes or even units of the opposite sex\non this battlefield. In the battlefield\nof the myriad races, the Lord himself\ncan return to his original world every\nonce in a while, but the heroes and\ntroops cannot return. Unless the Lord\nreaches a very, very high level, he can\nbring the heroes or troops back to his\nown world or send the heroes and troops\nback to their world. Therefore, heroes\nand troops are naturally dependent on\ntheir lords. But the level that the Lord\nwants to reach is extremely high and\nextremely difficult. There was only one\ndomain lord in the entire Lshia kingdom,\nthe Langsha domain queen. In the blueest\nstar world, it is the Dragon Sea\nKingdom. In the Blueest Star realm, the\nbattlefield of the myriad races, there\nare eight domains, and the Dragon Sea\nKingdom belongs to the Dragon Sea\ndomain. Therefore, it is quite normal\nfor some lords to have a home in the\nworld they live in and a partner on the\nbattlefield. Their wives usually do not\nget jealous because their partner on the\nbattlefield is a great help to their\nofficial spouse. Of the myriad races\nvying for supremacy, the strength of\nmost lords is inferior to that of\nheroes. After all, wandering lords and\nmarshall merit lords are a minority.\nHowever, the lord also holds the power\nof life and death over his subordinate\nheroes and troops. Because of the\nloyalty system, heroes with a loyalty\nlevel above 80 will never betray you.\nHeroes with 100% loyalty are even said\nto be loyal to their lord to the death\nwith legends even suggesting they commit\nsuicide together after the lord's\ndemise. Unwavering loyalty, never\nbetrayal, immense power, and diverse\nraces. Who wouldn't love a partner like\nthat? Many single people even come to\nthe battlefield of all races, hoping to\nsay goodbye to being single. It would be\nperfectly reasonable for Lynn Shiao to\nhave something happen with his own\npeerless enchantress. But Lynn Sha still\nhad a question in his mind. That is Ba's\narrival was related to the person who\nclaimed to be an ancient demon.\nRegardless of whether his laughter\nsounds like he or not ancient demon,\nthat name just doesn't sound right. He\nwouldn't act impulsively, letting his\nlower body control his upper body. Even\nif Baoi was truly sincere to him and her\nloyalty was genuine, did the ancient\ndemons have any other intentions? Lyn\nSha began to analyze. If what Baoi said\nwas true, but those ancient demons\ninitially tried to heal Baoi, only\nsealing her away after their efforts\nfailed. Furthermore, these ancient\ndemons are hiding in the cracks of the\nworld, saying they cannot bear Bao sees\nmisfortune. Finally, they even dumped\nher on me. What a kind yet weak demon?\nLet's double check, Lyn Sha thought to\nhimself. Ba, from the time you met me\nuntil now, has everything you've said\nbeen true? Ba&lt;unk&gt;'s loyalty has reached\n90%. If the Lord asks her to, she has no\nway to lie. Lyn Sha used this to confirm\nagain whether Baoi had deceived her. My\nlord, Ba blushed. What I said is of\ncourse true. Ba subconsciously thought\nthat Lynn Sha was asking him if her\nconfession earlier was true. The words\nshe just uttered, which were like a\nwoman's confession, had already taken\nher thousands of years of courage, and\nthe Lord actually wanted her to say them\nagain. If your lordship wishes to hear\nit, I may repeat myself. No, Lynsha\nshook his head. No matter how you look\nat it, Ba was innocent and sincere to\nhim, and that was enough. In the dead of\nnight, a lone man and a lone woman, a\nhandsome man and a beautiful woman,\ndeeply in love, dry wood and a raging\nfire, ready to ignite at the slightest\ntouch. The man is unmarried, and the\nwoman is also unmarried in a practical\nsense. At this time, the elegant and\nantique style rosewood bed Ba sat like a\ndelicate flower on the petals of a huge\ndeep red cloak. Her figure was as\ngraceful and alluring as spring water.\nShe closed her eyes shily, pounced on\nLinhao&lt;unk&gt;s back again, reached out,\nand wrapped her arms around him,\nembracing him once more. Without the\ncloak obstructing his view, Lyn Shiao\ncould feel an amazing tactile sensation\nand the graceful curves of her body. Lyn\nSha couldn't remember how many times he\nhad experienced shortness of breath. He\nturned around, not even noticing the\nfaint snort that inexplicably popped\ninto his head. The warm hibiscus tent.\nOuch, that hurts. Um, chapter 38. Drink\nmore hot water. Chufinga bravely goes\non. Lyn Shao, who was taking off his\ncoat, stopped. Just now, he seemed to\nhear a faint groan in his mind. Then,\nBaoi suddenly exclaimed and clutched her\nlower abdomen. Ba, what's wrong? The\nhazy, ambiguous atmosphere from just\nmoments ago vanished instantly. Lynsha\nstepped forward with concern and\nembraced Ba. Ba was now curled up in a\nball, her face deafly pale. Several\nbeads of sweat streamed down Ba's pretty\nface, and her body began to tremble\nuncontrollably. After a moment, Ba\ncaught her breath, but her red lips had\nturned pale, no longer possessing their\nprevious charm. My lord, I am so sorry.\nMy period has started. This is so\nsudden. I just had a severe pain in my\nlower abdomen. It's an ailment I've\nsuffered from for many years due to\nmisfortune. It always hurts terribly\nduring my minstral period. Soba. This\nhumble servant cannot give it to my\nlord. Sob. Lyn Sha breathed a sigh of\nrelief. It turned out to be minstal\ncramps. But what was that muffled groan\nI heard in my head just now? Why now of\nall times? He thought Ba or some ancient\ndemon had set a trap for him, wanting to\nmake fun of him. Or perhaps some ancient\ndemon developed some evil biological\ntechnology, planted some kind of\ncatalyst within Bao's body, waiting for\nthe moment she and the demon to become\nintimate before suddenly it crawled out\nof Bao's body, still chuckling to\nhimself while drinking hot water from\nhis thermos. Lynn Shiao shook his head,\ndispelling the strange association that\nonly Earthlings would have. It might\nreally be a coincidence, but it might\nreally be premeditated. In any case,\ntoday's romantic encounter is out of the\nquestion. Lyn Sha immediately examined\nhimself and carefully checked the Hasha\ntoken in his mind, but found nothing\nunusual. Turning his head, Lyn Sha saw\nBao's heartbroken expression and felt\nrelieved, offering her words of comfort.\nIt's all right. It's just the natural\norder of things. Drink more hot drinks.\nBefore she could finish speaking, Baosi\ngasped again, cold sweat pouring down\nher back. She then buried her face in\nLinia's arms, her jade-like fingers\ngripping his arm tightly. He's quite\nstrong. His strength value is no less\nthan 50. Is this some ancient demon\ntaking revenge because it didn't want to\ndrink hot water? Lyn Shao felt a sharp\npain from Bao's grip and thought to\nhimself. Baoi, is there any way to\nrelieve your pain? Lyn Sha asked, seeing\nthat Baoi had been in excruciating pain\nfor quite some time without any relief.\nYes, your majesty, I was unaware, but my\nprevious minstral flow didn't hurt this\nmuch. Perhaps perhaps the misfortune was\nsevered and my body underwent some\nunknown change. Sigh. After saying this,\nBaoi was in so much pain that she almost\nfainted. My lord, I deserve to die. Even\nso, Baoi still believed that she had\nbrought trouble to Lin Sha. She was\nafraid of embarrassing the Lord. She had\ntaken the initiative to throw herself\ninto his arms, and the Lord had also\nfallen for her. But at this crucial\nmoment, she will the Lord think I'm\nmaking fun of him. After all, her\nreputation as a vixen is so resounding.\nBaosi was in so much pain that she was\nsweating profusely and she was filled\nwith anxiety. Don't talk nonsense. Get\nsome rest. Lynn Sha didn't think too\nmuch about it. He covered Bao Ci with a\nblanket, turned around and sat down at\nthe table, then dialed Chufinga's\nnumber. It was already 2:00 a.m., but\nneither of them needed to say much about\ntheir brotherhood with Chufinga. Lyn\nShia, you called me. What's up? Chufinga\nanswered the call quickly, though his\nred hair looked a bit messy, clearly\nindicating he had just gone to sleep.\n\"You survived that terrifying demonic\ntide, huh? Truly, a scourge lives on for\na thousand years,\" Chufunga yawned.\n\"Fongu,\" Lyn Shao said, sounding\nslightly anxious. \"How can women relieve\nmenstrual cramps?\" \"Just drink more hot\nwater.\" Chufunga said casually, then\nsuddenly froze, staring intently at Lin\nSha. Lyn Sha, what did you just ask? How\nto relieve menstrual cramps? You Oh, I\nunderstand. Chufinga suddenly realized\nit's that beautiful heroine who was\nawarded. Mm. Lyn Sha nodded. You're\npretty good, kid. Chufinga laughed. You\nwere such a blockhead in school. You\nwere so handsome and a big shot, but you\nnever thought about love. Now you've\nonly been on the battlefield of 10,000\nraces for a day, and you've already been\ntaken by a beautiful heroine. You're\nalready taken. So, are you no longer\nsingle? Chufuningo winked at Lin Shiao,\ngiving him a knowing look. Stop fooling\naround. Let's get down to business. How\ncan we relieve menstrual cramps? Lyn\nXiao&lt;unk&gt;s face flushed slightly, but\nhis strong willpower controlled his\nfacial muscles, making him appear\nnonchalant. \"Uh, right. Isn't this it?\nHow do we say goodbye?\" Chufinga\nrealized, slapping her forehead. Oh\ndear, this is really bad timing. By the\nway, why are you asking me? I'm not a\nwoman. After Chufinga finished speaking,\nshe noticed that Linhao&lt;unk&gt;s expression\non the other side had become somewhat\nstrange. Didn't you always tell me that\nyou've dated at least five girlfriends?\nLyn Sha said expressionlessly. They even\nsaid how considerate you were back then.\nHow you relieve the girl's pain by\ngiving her a secret recipe and\nsuccessfully won her over? Lyn Sha\nstared at Chufinga. You haven't\nforgotten, have you? Or is the secret\nrecipe simply brown sugar and hot water?\nUnder Lyn Xiao's suspicious expression,\nChufunga was stunned. He spoke after a\nfew seconds. Uh huh. Haha. I haven't\nforgotten. How could I forget? This is\nonly my first day on the battlefield of\n10,000 races. I've been too busy to\nremember. Huh? Chufinga laughed and\nwaved her hands repeatedly. Wait here.\nI'll sort it out and give you the secret\nrecipe later. Lyn Sha nodded slowly and\nsaid, \"Thanks, brother. As soon as\npossible.\" After hanging up the call,\nChufinga looked up to the sky and let\nout a long howl. \"Hey, what are you\nbragging about? What are you bragging\nabout? Aren't you just asking for\ntrouble? I've only heard that female\nlords who have fought on the battlefield\nof 10,000 races are not troubled by this\nmatter. They seem to have a secret\nformula, but I'm not a woman myself, so\nhow would I know what that secret\nformula is? Where am I supposed to find\nthe secret recipe now? Chufinga thought\nfor a moment and then dialed his\nex-girlfriend's number. The call was\nimmediately disconnected after one ring,\nand the other party replied with, \"Get\nlost. I called my second ex-girlfriend,\nbut there was no answer. They should all\nbe asleep by now, and no one will answer\nmy calls.\" Chufinga scratched his head,\nsuddenly remembering a figure. That's\nright. That person must still be awake\nbecause she was just fighting against\nthe demonic tide. It was announced\nthroughout the entire region. So be it.\nSo what if it's embarrassing? Anyway, it\nwas Lin Sha who caused this trouble, so\nit's only right that she bears the\nconsequences. Chufinga gritted her teeth\nand dialed Dugu Jaolon&lt;unk&gt;s number. A\nmoment later, the communication was\nestablished. woman of unparalleled\nbeauty and aloofness, standing alone in\nthe night, covered in blood, held a\nthree-foot sword and coldly gazed over.\nIt seems she has already defeated the\ndemonic tide. Chufinga, what do you want\nwith me? The dazzling aura and intense\nkilling intent emanating from the aloof\nwoman could even be transmitted through\nthe interface. Chufinga felt her heart\nskip a beat. Ahem dugu jaon. Ahem, I\nwant to ask you how to relieve menstrual\ncramps in girls. Um, now the intense\nkilling intent seemed almost tangible.\nChapter 39. The chosen one and dogs must\nnot be purchased. Not long after, Lyn\nSha received a call from Chufinga.\nChufinga, on the other end, was covered\nin cold sweat as if he had just gone\nthrough a major battle. Chufinga, what's\nwrong with you? It's nothing. It's just\nthat recalling the secret recipe is too\ntaxing on my brain. Chufinga waved his\nhand and said, \"Could it be that this\nkid also has a memory palace?\" He looked\nso exhausted. Lyn Sha was still asking\nwhen Chufunga said, \"Lynn Shiao, I've\ngiven you the secret recipe. It's\ngetting late. I need to rest a bit so I\ncan recruit my first hero tomorrow.\nBye-bye.\" He then hung up the call.\nSomething's not quite right about phone.\nLyn Sha shook his head. So the secret\nrecipe was actually so simple. However,\nthis secret formula is only available in\nthe battlefield of all races. So many\nfemale lords who join the battlefield of\nall races will not be affected. But this\nsecret recipe only drops from killing\nmonsters. Although the drop rate is not\nlow, no one auctioned it on the first\nday of the new server. Lyn Shia checked\nthe auction house. There were only a few\ndozen items on display, none of which\nwere what he wanted. He glanced at Baoi\nbeside him again and found that she had\nfallen into a deep sleep, but her body\nwould occasionally twitch and convulse\nas if she was still enduring pain. Fine,\nI'll sell all my junk equipment tomorrow\nmorning and then try to buy this item.\nThere's no point in rushing things now.\nThe most important thing is to sleep.\nToday is only the first day, and so much\nhas happened. Not only did I break the\nblue star record and obtain my first\nhero, but I also defeated the most\ndangerous demonic tide. The system also\nforced a fim fatal into my life, and it\ntook a lot of effort to turn her into a\ngreat help. With Bowsy around, I won't\nhave any problem with my gold coins in\nthe future. Furthermore, the loyalty of\nhis subjects and the city's defense\nsystem have been strengthened once\nagain. As for the issue of Ein and Yang\nreversal, we can deal with it slowly\nlater. That little girl Ba is lying\nright next to me. How could she possibly\nrun away now that the excitement has\nworn off? Lyn Shia is also feeling\ntired. Lyn Sha took off his coat and\nlaid down on the rosewood bed.\nFortunately, the legendary lord's\nmansion was spacious and elegant with a\nlarge and comfortable bed. Lyn Sha lay\ndown and fell into a deep sleep. The\nnight was as dark as ink, and the loyal\nEmo Dao iron guards and others took\nturns standing guard to protect the\nlord's mansion. The next day, early to\nfarm in the wild, ran into Gene Dang\nagain. Great success. I've gotten\nanother amazing item. It's a stealth\ntalisman. Oh, Gene Dang seemed very\npleased. That's good. It will be helpful\nto us. Oomph. With this stealth\ntalisman, after we use it, all troop\ntypes will have their presence minimized\nfor 24 hours. In other words, we can\ncross the battlefield of the myriad\nraces supremacy without attracting the\nattention of neutral monsters, and it\nwon't fail when I launch an attack. I\ncan use it to gain the upper hand for 24\nhours. Not bad. Not bad. H not bad rare\nequipment. Gene Datong smiled stiffly.\nSeeing someone else being luckier than\nhim first thing in the morning was\nhardly something to be happy about. Your\nluck has been better than mine lately.\nCould you really be the chosen one?\nHaha, maybe. We always say life and\ndeath are predestined and wealth and\nhonor are determined by fate. No one can\nsay for sure, right? Datangs tail was\npractically wagging, which made Gene\nDang feel a surge of disdain. By the\nway, after we meet up later, shall we\ncontinue with our plan? Gene Dang\nchanged the subject. Keep going. Why not\nkeep going? Xiao Daong said casually.\nThat kid Lynn Shiao dares to mess with\nme, dares to disrespect me, and that\nmeans he disrespects our international\nschool. How could the principal and the\nothers let him go? Let us kill that brat\nfirst to enhance our school's\nreputation, and the principal will\nsurely reward us. After all, our school\nhas long had its eye on that woman, the\ndomain lord. Shu, Gene Dang interrupted\nXiao Dataong. Watch your words. Don't\ndiscuss this matter before the plan is\ncompleted. Hiao Daong realized he had\nmisspoke and changed the subject. Now\nthat we're on the same team, as long as\nyou activate your location tracking and\nI activate my teleportation talisman, we\ncan immediately get to Lyn Xiao's\nlocation. But before that, I'm going to\nhumiliate him first. Xiao Datang opened\nthe chat channel and spoke again. Hey,\nour F-level genius Lin Shia is still\nalive. What? Divine retribution hasn't\nkilled you yet. You're lucky you\nsurvived. That's a demonic tide. Eay\njumped out and replied, \"Rol, didn't I\nlearn about demonic tides? There's no\nsuch thing as a demonic tide that drops\nmeteors and fire from the sky. There's\nno such case in the textbook. It's\nrecorded on page 197 of the People's\nEducation Presses Science Related to\nDemon Tide and Beast Tide. He chimed in\nagain. You you little brat, are you\nasking for a beating? Do you believe it\nor not? Chin Sher Huang. Goodness. Heay\neven answered first. The chat channel\nfell silent for a moment, but everyone\nknew that they were all struggling to\nhold back their laughter. Damn it. Heuh\nXiao Daong was about to explode again,\nbut Gene Dang, who was standing nearby,\nquickly pulled him back. Dang, calm\ndown. Have you forgotten what you're\nsupposed to be doing? Xiao Datang,\npanting heavily, managed to calm himself\ndown and said, \"We don't teach that\nstuff at our international school. It's\nuseless. We'd rather learn Japanese.\"\nSo, what if it's a demonic tide, Lynsha?\nYou survived such a dangerous demonic\ntide. You must have been seriously\ninjured, right? How many of your\nsoldiers and heroes are left? Oh my, you\npoor lad. Your pathetic ordinary soldier\nand ordinary hero has an F-level talent.\nUnfortunately, peace is ineffective\nagainst the demonic tide. Can you\nwithstand the next wave of beasts? Sai,\nwhat can I do? I'm a good person. Give\nme the black long sword, and I'll\nreluctantly help you fend off the beast\ntide. Consider it a promise I made out\nof loyalty. How's that going, Lyn Sha?\nHurry up. Because I am the chosen one.\nIf I wait any longer and I get some good\nequipment, I won't be able to see your\nblack long sword. Oh dear. Do you still\nwant to protect your beautiful heroine?\nDon't let me get away with it. I have a\nparticular fondness for married women.\nAnd I have a hundred ways to make your\nbeautiful heroine fly to the heavens.\nHuh? Shameless. How old are you? How can\nyou speak so vulgarly? I can't stand it\nanymore. The pretty girl jumped out and\ncursed.\nH Why don't you give it a try? You'll\nsee that not only is my speech vulgar,\nbut my actions are even more vulgar.\nShameless. The pretty girl went offline\nand stopped replying. Lyn Shao Daton\ncontinued to confront Lin Sha. Listen to\nmy advice, brother, and remove the black\nlong sword from the shelves. Then give\nit to me. As for your previous\ndisrespect, just kneel down and\napologize. I can even protect you. Ding.\nPlayer Lin Shia has removed Black Long\nSword one from the auction and it is\ntemporarily unavailable for auction.\nThere was a brief silence in the chat\nchannel. Xiao Daong was stunned and\ninstantly felt his vanity was satisfied\nlike never before. Lyn Shiao chickened\nout as expected. What good is the\npersonal strength of a lord with frank\ntalent? They still have to obediently\nbow down in front of him. Harah, Lyn\nSha, good, good. It's right to face\nreality. All you need to do now is trade\nthe black long sword to me using the god\nsystem. As for kneeling, you can just go\nlive and kneel down and cow so that\neveryone in the district can see it. You\nwon't need to come all the way here.\nHarah, I've been very lenient with you,\nhaven't I? Ding. Player Lin Shiao has\nrelist Black Long Sword 1 for 10,000\ngold coins. This is now restricted. It\ncannot be sold to player Xiao Datong at\nany price. Note, Children of Destiny and\nDogs are not permitted for purchase. A\nfew seconds later, haha. The chat\nchannel erupted in bursts of laughter\nonce again. Chapter 40. An evil plot.\nSelling equipment. Lyn Shiao. Xiao Daong\nwas speechless with rage. I'll make sure\nyou die. a horrible death was also\nindignant and said to Xiao Dataong,\n\"This Lin Shiao is really disrespectful\nto us.\" \"Da Chong, use your talent skill\nto locate immediately. I'll use the\nteleportation scroll. Let's charge\nstraight there.\" Gene Dang hesitated for\na moment, then gritted his teeth and\nsaid, \"All right, his B level ability\npositioning can only be used once every\n24 hours.\" In order to establish his\nauthority against Lin Sha, he decided to\nuse it now. Use the talent skill\npositioning. A flash of light appeared,\nand Gene Dang closed his eyes, sensing\ncarefully. A moment later, he opened his\neyes and exclaimed with surprise, \"Holy\ncrap!\" Lyn Xiao&lt;unk&gt;so seat is right\nnext to us. What? Ziao Daong&lt;unk&gt;s eyes\nlit up. Right next to us? Yes, there are\nonly two or three novice lords between\nus. Ginden said, \"The location\ncapabilities only allow for a glimpse\nthrough the fog of war. All I can see is\nhis territory, which has already been\nenclosed by walls.\" \"Looks like that\nkid's got some skills,\" Xiao Dataong\nsaid sinisterly. \"Too bad even a level\none wall can't stop us.\" Jean Dang\nnodded and added. Also, when my\nconsciousness returned just now, I\nnoticed that the two lords in the middle\nseemed to be a skinny boy surrounded by\na large number of flower fairies and a\nwhite stocking lowly. They all look\nweak. None of their units are a match\nfor us. A flower fairy, a white stocking\nlowly. Xiao Datangs breathing became\nrapid. Flower fairies are the most\nbeautiful fairies, but their attack\npower is not strong. They are just elite\nsoldiers. Their appearance is almost\nidentical to that of humans, and they\nare also light and graceful. They can be\nplayed with in many different ways. I\nhaven't had any taste of meat in a long\ntime. I'll play with the skinny boy\nlater. Orc veteran behind him also\nlicked his lips. Orcs are seasoned\nveterans, a rare unit known for their\nferocity, savagery, and\nbloodthirstiness. In the battlefield of\nthe myriad races, they are among the\nmost brutal races besides monsters.\nHearing their lord's words, the orc\nveterans were also drawn in, their\nmouths watering. As for white stocking\nlols, nine out of 10 lis are rich. Those\nwho dare to wear white stockings are\nboth foolish and rich, so the experience\nmust be quite different. Since they are\nso weak and so close to us, why don't\nwe? Xiao Datongs eyes flashed with a\nmurderous glint. Why don't we just kill\nour way through? First, we'll take care\nof the skinny kid and the white stocking\nlowly's resistance. Then, we'll seize\nthe flower fairy and the white stocking\ngirl. After we've had our fun, we'll\nstart a live stream and wipe out that\nkid, Lin Sha, hacking him to pieces and\nhumping at his beautiful heroine. Gene\nDang remained silent. He hesitated and\nsaid, \"The newbie zone is different from\nthe official zone. Most people in the\nnewbie zone are from the same country.\nYou can rob someone of your own kind\nwithout a legitimate reason, but killing\nsomeone of your own kind will be\npunished. We have a talisman for\nattacking. The punitive talisman can\nonly be used on one lord. It must be\nused on Lin Shia. Then for the other two\nlords, can I just x-ray them without\nkilling them? Gene dang. Xiao daong is\nutterly brainless. Or rather, his mind\nis filled with nothing but lewd\nthoughts. If they're only raped and not\nkilled, are they supposed to wait for\nthe lord to run back to the real world\nand complain? No matter how powerful the\nforces behind these two are once they've\naroused public outrage, the people\nbehind them won't bother cleaning up\ntheir mess. Just then, the main god\nsystem suddenly issued a notification.\nNewbie zone number 89757.\nPlayer Yong Hi has been eliminated. Ziao\nDaong and Gene Dang looked at each other\nin bewilderment. This is the first lord\nto die in the newbie zone. He died on\nthe second day after the server opened,\nwhich is relatively late. Immediately\nafterwards, a message suddenly appeared\nin the chat channel. Help! Help! A lot\nof monsters have suddenly attacked my\nterritory. It looks like an exceptional\nlevel demon. My troops can't hold out at\nall. Someone, please save me. The chat\nchannel fell silent. No one knew what\nwas going on. How could a large number\nof monsters suddenly appear and attack\nthe territory? It's not a monster tide.\nBefore anyone could respond, the main\ngod system announced again. In beginner\nzone number 89757,\nplayer Leong Guang has been eliminated.\nHis territory has been captured and the\npreviously occupied mine is now\nunclaimed. Who who knows what's going\non? Someone asked in the chat channel.\nAlthough everyone was on guard against\neach other, the sudden appearance of the\nmonster made everyone tense. Oh my god,\nmonsters have appeared here too. They're\nbone demons. Dozens of bone demons. My\nunits got wiped out instantly. Guys, I\nmight be in serious trouble. Newbie zone\nnumber 89757.\nPlayer Wuang has been eliminated. Piss.\nThe successive deaths of lords have\ncreated a climate of fear and unease\namong the people. It was the meteor\nshower last night. Someone jumped out\nand spoke in the chat channel. The\ntextbook said that special demonic tides\ncan infect nearby monsters and turn them\ninto monsters. They can also cause them\nto go berserk. Everyone be careful. Oh\nno, why didn't you say so earlier? I'm\non my way to farm Pokémon right now. Oh\nmy god, the little elf has turned into\nan elf zombie. But even as a zombie, her\nfigure is still amazing. Newbie zone\nPlayer Lu Tong has been eliminated.\nEveryone, at this moment, Ziao Daong and\nGene Dang exchanged a knowing glance.\nThe two wicked people came up with a new\nway out. Now, because of the meteor\nshower, a large number of wild monsters\nin the entire Newbie area have mutated\ninto monsters. Notifications of newbie\nlords dying come in every now and then.\nPerfect. We can take advantage of the\nchaos to break through. As long as no\none escapes alive, no one will know it\nwas us. He then get started. Lyn Shia,\nwho had also gotten up early, was\norganizing his equipment and planning to\nbuy some life healing potions when he\ndiscovered Xiao Datongs outrageous\nremarks. Incompetent wretch, barking\nlike a mad man, Lyn Sha muttered to\nhimself. So they gave him a small\npunishment. That's right. The\nlife-healing medicine is the secret\nformula for treating menstrual cramps.\nTherefore, female lords who enter the\nbattlefield of the myriad races will not\nbe troubled by this problem. The\nmedicine originally used to treat wounds\nand stop bleeding only needs a small sip\nto regulate in and yang unblock chi and\nblood make people feel comfortable all\nover and no longer suffer from pain.\nIt's unclear who first discovered the\nlife-healing potion's effects, but it\nbenefited many female lords and became a\nclosely guarded secret passed down\nthrough generations. The drop rate for\nthis potion isn't low and it doesn't\nhave the effect of bringing the dead\nback to life or restoring flesh to\nbones, so it's not exactly a rare item.\nTherefore, Lyn Sha estimated that\nsomeone must have already obtained it by\nnow. Lyn Sha first wrote the note,\n\"Children of destiny and dogs are not\nallowed to purchase,\" on his black long\nsword, then suddenly thought that\nleaving a message was also a good idea.\nHe put his two weapons, the birchwood\nlongbow and the claw of attack into the\nauction house. The birch long bow is a\nfine weapon, but it only costs 800 gold\ncoins, while the rare attack claw costs\n2,500 gold coins. Then, a note was added\nunder both weapons. You can use healing\npotions to offset part of your gold\ncoins. Based on past year's prices, a\nbottle of life healing potion costs 100\ngold coins. Even in a new server, it\nwouldn't be too expensive. Using it to\nexchange for weapons is far from\nworthwhile. After doing all this, Lyn\nSha spoke again in the chat channel.\nLooking to buy life healing potions.\nPrivate message me with your price. No\nreply if you don't want them. Then Lynn\nSha closed the chat channel. Beside him\nlay the beautiful and sleeping Bi. Lyn\nSha did not wake her up. After all, her\nabilities were mostly passive, and she\nhad no way to fight on the battlefield.\nStepping out of the Lord&lt;unk&gt;'s mansion,\nthe phantom archers, the iron guards of\nthe Mod Dao, and the divine arm archers\non duty were in good order. The three\ncaptains and pay men had also rested and\nwere waiting for orders in the\ncourtyard. A hint of a hidden smile on\ntheir faces. Even a fool could tell that\nLin Sha knew everyone thought something\nhad happened between him and Baoi. While\nthat wasn't wrong, it just so happened\nthat things didn't go as planned. Then\nPay Min, this down on his luck playboy,\neven raised an eyebrow at Lyn Sha. Pay\nMin, come here. I have something good to\nshow you. Pay Min, my lord, I was wrong.\nLyn Sha, the grandson, is quick to put\non an act. Lyn Sha, you come here right\nnow. and Tangi Saw the Lin come here\ntoo. Chapter 41. A stunning beauty\ncaptivating allure unleashed. Hey Min,\nTang Yi, and Saul walked over\ncautiously. Last night, the three of\nthem sat by the fire and talked quite a\nbit about the Lord and his wife's\nambiguous relationship. At this moment,\nunder the Lord's command, they dared not\ndisobey and had no choice but to step\nforward. Only Song Rui nodded slightly\nin satisfaction. I understand the\nprinciple that too much talk leads to\nmistakes. So, I just listened from\nbeginning to end and didn't say a word.\nGossiping about the Lord is absolutely\nforbidden. These three guys are in big\ntrouble now. Lyn Sha pulled out a\nkatana, a large bow, and a horse slaying\nsword and threw them to the three of\nthem. Take it. See if it suits your\nneeds. Overjoyed, the three brandished\ntheir weapons a few times. Tangg Yi and\nSaw the Lin immediately knelt on one\nknee and bowed, saying, \"Thank you,\nLord.\" Payman also bowed deeply to show\nhis respect. \"Sui\nLynn Shiao\" turned around and said, \"Son\nRueer, I'll give you a better bow and\ncrossbow next time I get it. This deadly\nbow is a bit mediocre and doesn't do\njustice to you.\" Song Ruer breathed a\nsigh of relief, quickly saying he dared\nnot accept such praise and thank the\nLord. soldering. Pay Min who was\nadmiring the dance of fine snow display\nalso exclaimed in admiration, \"What a\nfine knife. The blade is long and\nslender, and it's easy to use. I am\nskilled in the sword of all things, and\nthis katana can also be used as a sword.\nThank you for your kindness, Lord.\"\nHaving said that, Payman picked up the\nsword, tucked at his waist, casually\ntossed it away. The sword landed some\ndistance away, shattering with a thud.\nIt turned out to be nothing more than a\nrusty iron sword and a rotten wooden\nscabbard. Upon seeing this, Tanggi asked\ncuriously, \"Young Master Pay Min, the\nrenowned sword saint, only uses a rusty\niron sword.\" Pay Min tucked the dance of\nfine snow into his waistband, waved his\nsleeve, and smiled freely. The sword is\nan external object to me. My body is the\nsword, and all things are swords. I am\npowerful with any sword, so even a rusty\niron sword can shine with unparalleled\nsharpness in my hands. Damn it, he got\naway with it. The people nearby\nwhispered to each other. Then why did\nyou throw away this sword and replace it\nwith the one the Lord bestowed upon you?\nTanggi persisted, seizing the\nopportunity to attack relentlessly. Lyn\nShiao added, \"Dance of fine snow.\" \"Eh.\"\nPay Min looked up at the sky looking\nlike a hermit and then said, \"A precious\nsword is given to a hero, a gift from\nthe Lord. This is a great affirmation\nand honor for me. Although I can use any\nsword with unparalleled skill, if I were\nto use the sword bestowed upon me by the\nLord to kill enemies, I would only\nremember the Lord's kindness and be even\nmore powerful, thus upholding the Lord's\nmarshall virtue.\" This kid is indeed\nworthy of being a general. He speaks so\nsuccinctly. Lyn Sha thought to himself.\nPay men was very satisfied with his\nperformance. But he couldn't help but\nshow some humility. So he asked\nnervously. Judging from your appearance,\nmy lord, you seem to be proficient in\nmany martial arts, and you must be quite\nskilled with a sword. I am humbled that\nyou have bestowed such a fine sword upon\nme. But do not use it yourself. No need\nto worry. Lynsha said, \"I have something\neven better. Since it doesn't matter\nwhat sword you use, I won't give it to\nyou.\" After saying that, Lyn Sha took\nout Falshion, showed it to everyone, and\nthen put it back into the god space.\nFrom the moment Falin appeared, it\nexuded an extraordinary quality. The\ndragon bone handle and the dragon\nbone-shaped blade with their dim and\ngloomy light radiated a murderous aura\nand were incomparably sharp. It was\nclearly no ordinary item. Pay Min\nremained expressionless. Tangg Yi and\nthe others couldn't help but chuckle to\nthemselves. Inside the territory, the\nsoldiers on duty also witnessed the\nlittle incident that occurred in the\nsquare. Although they were on guard or\npatrolling, they all felt a warm feeling\nin their hearts. There's no other reason\nthan that the Lord is exceptionally\ncapable, generous, and kind-hearted,\ngetting along well with his\nsubordinates, and joking around with\nthem. It's truly fortunate to be able to\nserve under such a lord. Unbeknownst to\nthem, the loyalty of everyone in the\nterritory increased once again. At that\nmoment, the gate of the Lord&lt;unk&gt;'s\nmansion creaked open, and a stunningly\nbeautiful woman walked out. It was Ba.\nThe epic forest which cloc cloak that\nLynn Shiao had given her with a hood\npulled down. Although only her head was\nvisible, it still couldn't hide her\nstunning beauty. The cloak, like fiery\nred petals, was elegant and luxurious,\nmaking Baoi even more beautiful. Ba's\nblack hair cascaded down her back like a\nwaterfall. Her face was fair and\nflawless, as if sculpted from ice\ncrystal. Her nose was soft yet straight.\nHer red lips were full, and her big eyes\nwere captivating. Her whole demeanor was\na blend of innocence and allure, making\nher truly pitiful to behold. Ba's face\nstill seemed to have a blush and shyness\nwhich easily made people think of\nsomething. My lord, Baoi began. Why did\nyou come out? Shouldn't you be resting?\nLyn Shao said gently. Lord, you want Ba\nto get some rest? Was Baoi exhausted\nlast night? The answer is self-evident.\nSeeing Baoi emerge from the Lord's\nmansion and hearing their lord's\nattitude, the group realized what was\nhappening and quickly lowered their\nheads which had been staring at Ba in a\nmoment of irrationality. This is very\nlikely the Lord's wife or at the very\nleast the Lord's concubine. Immediately,\na wonderful feeling lingered in their\nhearts. Such a beautiful woman, so\nstunningly gorgeous, is the perfect\nmatch for their most beloved Lord. This\nfurther demonstrates the Lord's power\nand charisma. A perfect match made in\nheaven. These are things that only exist\nin their territory. Being a member of\nthat territory is truly a source of\npride and honor. Ding. Because Baosi's\nloyalty has reached 90 points, allowing\nher to do whatever she wants. And she\nhas appeared before the people of the\nterritory. Her stunning beauty special\neffect will be triggered within one\nmonth. All units in the territory gain\nan additional 20% loyalty to the lord\nand an additional 20% production\nefficiency. If a city where Baoi resides\nis attacked by foreign enemies in order\nto protect Baoi, all friendly units gain\n100% increased health and morale during\nbattle and will never retreat. Lynsha\nnodded. It seemed that as long as Baoi\nshowed up once a month, the people of\nthe territory could maintain the special\neffects. As for Baoi, although she\ndidn't truly become his woman, it seems\npretty much the same now. At least\neveryone in the territory thinks so.\nAnyway, he couldn't escape this vixen's\ngrasp in the future, Lyn Sha thought to\nhimself. My lord, I wish to offer my\nassistance in developing your territory.\nBaoi noticed the crowds reaction and\nknew they had misunderstood, but she was\nwilling to help and explained her\npurpose to Lin Sha. Seeing that Bao Si\nwas not unwell for the time being, Lin\nShiao said, \"All right, let's take a\nlook at what other construction projects\nthere are later.\" Lin Xiao's level one\nLord's Mansion comes with a territory of\nup to 50,000 square me, which currently\nconsists of only the Lord's Mansion,\ntavern, warehouse, and a few simple\nresidential buildings. The tavern\nrecruits heroes, and you can also have a\ndrink and a meal there, but it's too\nsmall. The warehouse is a system\nbuilding and cannot be entered or\nexited. It can only be looted when it is\noccupied by the enemy. The residential\nbuildings were even intended for the\nlocal farmers. The soldiers live in\nbarracks while the heroes live in the\nlord's mansion. This legendary lord's\nmansion is quite large with side halls\nand wing rooms. Last night was an\nunusual night. One of the heroes, Pay\nMin, was resting on a cot by the fire\nwith Tang Yi and the others. Not daring\nto disturb the lord in the other heroes\nsleep. It can be said that the\nconstruction of the territory started\nfrom scratch. There was nothing to be\ndone. Tangi, you lead the moa iron\nguards to these areas to clear out the\nwild monsters. Remember, bring back the\nmeat of the redeyed ram. That's our\nlunch. Lyn Shiao took out a few pieces\nof paper with a sketch he had drawn from\nmemory before leaving home, marking a\nsimple route and a dozen or so monster\nspots. Song Ruer, you lead the archers\nto these places to kill monsters.\nThey're all slowm moving. Just be\ncareful of the dark elf spies. They can\nstealthily engage in melee combat, so\ndon't get hurt. Soldier, you take 20\nphantom archers and go this way. These\nare the easier monsters. Just clear them\nout slowly. Paymen, didn't you say you\nhadn't killed enough nest demons? There\nare plenty more along this path. You can\ntry out your new sword and see how sharp\nit is. If you can't win, come back to\nme.\" Pay Min curled his lip and said,\n\"Lord, don't underestimate the great\nTang Sword Saint.\" Lyn Sha chuckled. The\nremaining phantom archers will defend\nthe base. \"Yes, sir.\" Lyn Sha\nimmediately made arrangements, sending\nhis men in four groups to grind monsters\nand gain experience. After all, troops\ncannot participate in territory\nconstruction. And even if they wanted\nto, they would not know where to start\nas the buildings within the territory\nare not actually built brick by brick.\nThese things still need to be done by\nthe farmers. It was still early and as\nthe saying goes, the early bird catches\nthe worm. Lyn Sha had experienced a day\nof intense battles yesterday. Today is\nthe day when most lords will begin what\nthey will all go through. Farming.\nChapter 42. The escape of the white\nstocking Lolita. Lynn Shao excelled in\nhis studies at school and being a\nChinese person from Earth in his\nprevious life. He was naturally skilled\nin farming, possessing a grade C farming\nskill that increased the production\nspeed of all his territories by 10%. The\ntalent eternal peace further grants life\nand destiny, increases crop output by\nfive times and accelerates crop\nmaturation by five times. Peace\nincreases the extraction speed of all\nresources and mineral veins by five\ntimes and increases the construction,\nupgrade, and production speed of all\nbuildings by 100%. Therefore, the speed\nof farming and construction can be\ndescribed as extremely fast. The\nterritory now has five excellent spirit\nfields, which mature every 9.6 hours,\nyielding 2,000 units of spirit rice each\ntime they mature. It's roughly\nequivalent to maturing every 10 hours\nwith a yield of 2,000 gene per mu. This\nyield, which was the level of rice yield\nper moo that Lyn Xiao's most respected\ngrandfather had worked hard for his\nwhole life to achieve on Earth in his\nprevious life, is actually more than two\nharvests a day on the battlefield of the\nmyriad races. However, the battlefield\nof the myriad races cannot be judged by\ncommon sense. Apart from ordinary and\nelite troops being similar to ordinary\npeople, rare and above troops have a\nsignificantly increased food\nconsumption. As for epic and legendary\ntroops, because they are too powerful,\ntheir consumption is exceptionally high.\nMoreover, there are countless enormous\nbeasts such as codto beasts, minotaurs,\nbehemoths, cyclops, hydras, and dragons.\nIt is quite normal for a behemoth or\ndragon to eat hundreds or thousands of\nkilograms in one meal. The grains grown\nare stored in the main god systems\nwarehouse and will not be damaged or\nexpire. In the later stages, the number\nof troops in the Lord's mansion is as\nvast as the sea with thousands or tens\nof thousands of soldiers fighting each\nother at any time. It can be said that\nno matter how much you grow, you can\naccumulate it. This also gave rise to\nmany lords skilled in farming on the\nbattlefield of the myriad races who\ncontinuously farmed in the rear of the\nmain battlefield to supply the military\nmerit lords on the front lines.\nLynhiao's current five excellent spirit\nfields if they were normal excellent\nspirit fields would not be enough to\ndeal with his current two heroes, 62\ntypes of troops, and 30 peasants.\nFortunately, Lyn Xiaou's talent was\nstrong enough that the output of his\nexcellent spirit field was comparable to\nthat of a legendary spirit field.\nMoreover, when killing monsters, he also\nmade sure to keep the edible monster\nmeat, such as lava giant lizard meat and\nbarbarian beef. He had kept quite a lot\nof these in his warehouse. We still need\nto accumulate more spirit fields in the\nfuture. After all, the Chinese soldiers\nare humanoid, so their consumption is\nonly normally high. But if we want to\nlead the Chinese soldiers to become king\nand dominate, we must increase their\nnumbers. The Mod Dao iron guards and the\ndivine arm archers are all legion units.\nLarge-scale legion battles are the best\nway to showcase their combat power.\nLuckily, we have this pond. We can\nreplenish some of our food supplies and\nstart using it. Lyn Sha took out an epic\nquality pond. Pond quality epic. Output\n200 1,000 units. Default output spirit\nfish which can be caught and farmed with\nother habitable creatures. Time 96 19.2\nhours. Special effect one. When consumed\nrandomly increases one of the following\nattributes by one point. Strength spirit\nbody or soul. This effect can only be\napplied once every 24 hours. Special\neffect two. When consumed, there is a\nvery small chance to increase the user's\nskill level up to a maximum of B level.\nUpgrade requirements too complicated to\nlist. Of 10,000 races is, as the name\nsuggests, a pond. This pond can raise\nfish, other aquatic creatures, and even\nsome amphibious units. You need a pond\nto recruit them. The pond is supposed to\nhouse spirit fish, but they're actually\njust ordinary spirit grass carp.\nFortunately, there's plenty of them, so\nyou can eat your fill. But once the pond\nreaches the epic level, its nature\nchanges. The resulting spirit infused\ngrass carb even come with two special\neffects. The first is that it can\nrandomly increase one of the four stats\nby one point once a day. The second\nspecial effect can enhance a user's\nskill level. For example, if Lynn Shiao\neats the spirit fish, there is a certain\nprobability that he will upgrade his\nmixed martial arts level D, all weapon\nmastery level D, all troop type command\nlevel D, and farming level C to the\nhighest level B. Of course, under normal\ncircumstances, this probability is\nextremely small. But under the influence\nof Lin Xiao's eternal peace fortune,\nthis probability has become small. If\nyou eat it every day, over time you'll\neventually see an improvement. Moreover,\neating spirit fish can increase one of\nthe four dimensions every day. Lyn Shia\ntook out the pond structure, which was\njust a white ball of light. He handed it\nto the rare farmer he had summoned.\nBuild a pond. Ding. Your farmer is\nbuilding a pond. Pond under\nconstruction. Construction countdown. 47\nhours 59 minutes and 59 seconds. Click\nto pause. The pond, which originally\ntook 4 days to build, was shortened to 2\ndays, which made Lin Shia nod with\nsatisfaction. With an epic level pond,\nany one of these epic quality spirit\nfish can fetch an astronomical price at\nthe auction house just because it\nrandomly adds one point to attributes\nand enhances skills. But before I am\nstrong enough, I can't let anyone find\nout. I'll enjoy it with my subordinates\nfor now. This pond is a wonderful thing.\nEpic level pawns are rare, even in the\nofficial Lon region, and there may only\nbe a few dozen in the Hasha domain,\nwhich are firmly held by powerful\nfamilies. While the hardworking farmers\nwere building the pond, Lynn Shiao\ncalled over another farmer and left the\nblacksmith shop for him to build. Of the\nmyriad races, apart from many buildings\nthat can be built instantly, all other\nbuildings require farmers to construct\nthem. However, buildings that are\ndropped no longer require resources to\nconstruct. This is a design feature.\nBlacksmith shop quality average\nrequired. Blacksmith farmer. Function.\nRepair and maintain farm implements and\nweapons. Replenish consumables such as\narrows and javelins. Produce ordinary\nlevel weapons and armor. A simple basic\nblacksmith shop. If there are no\nblacksmiths, farmers can even be asked\nto act as blacksmiths, but they can only\nperform the bare minimum of their\nfunctions. Blacksmith shops don't have a\nproduction speed because they require\nblacksmiths to work alongside farmers.\nThe more people working on\nblacksmithing, the faster the blacksmith\nshops output will be. At this stage, the\nmain function of the blacksmith shop is\nto replenish the arrows of the phantom\narchers and the divine archers to\nreplenish the kitchen knives of the\npeasants and to serve as a prerequisite\nbuilding for the tier three base. Even\nif I upgrade the blacksmith shop to the\nlegendary level, it won't be of much use\nbecause it won't be able to play its\nfull role until there are blacksmith\nmasters joining. Let's build it first.\nIt doesn't require resources anyway. We\ncan upgrade it later. Ding. Your farmer\nis building a blacksmith shop.\nBlacksmith shop under construction.\nConstruction countdown. 23 hours 59\nminutes and 59 seconds. Click to pause.\nAfter setting down the two buildings,\nLyn Shia checked the requirements for\nupgrading his Lord's Manor to level two.\nLord's mansion level one. Quality\nlegendary. Defense 5,000 + 5,000 plus\n2,000 for the walls. Upgrade\nrequirements. Prerequisite buildings.\nTavern 1. Spirit field May 1st. Saved.\nRequired resources: 5,000 wood, 5,000\nstone, 3,000 iron, or 3,000 copper or\n500 refined iron, 500 refined copper.\nSaved. Upgrade. Cool down time 14 hours\n18 minutes, and 15 seconds. Upgrading\nfrom tier 1 to tier 2 isn't too\ndifficult. Almost every lord will build\nthe prerequisite buildings. As a top\nstudent, Lin Shia had already memorized\nthe required conditions and had long\nsince met the prerequisite buildings and\nresources. All he lacked now was the\ncool down time for the upgrade. That's\nright. Upgrading your lord's mansion to\nlevel one will trigger a monster horde,\nand the god system will give your lord's\nmansion a 24-hour cool down period. The\nupgrade was completed at 11:55 p.m.\nyesterday, bringing the Lord's Mansion\nto level two. Lynn Shia needs to wait 24\nhours, and the upgrade will continue\ntonight. The initial Lord's Mansion is\njust to make up the numbers. Only the\nfirst Lord's Mansion is the real Lord's\nMansion. The Lord can build farm houses\nand produce farmers. The second Lord's\nMansion unlocks more buildings. As I\ncapture more and more mines, my 30\nfarmers are no longer enough. I need to\nbuild farm houses right now. Just as Lin\nSha was enthusiastically carrying out\nconstruction in his territory, his\nneighbor, Lord, not far away,\nencountered an unexpected disaster. No,\nbig dog, don't die. A sweet coetish\nvoice cried out, trembling with sobs.\nOuch. Damn it. You stepped on me. Ah,\nit's the Lord. Flee. Run. The enemy is\ntoo strong. We can't hold out any\nlonger. As soon as the werewolf captain,\nlying flat on the ground, finished\nspeaking, he kicked his legs, closed his\neyes, and died. \"Big, what did you say?\"\n\"Damn it, do you mean I should run\nnorth?\" Jazine asked in a tearful voice,\nbut there was no reply. \"But I don't\nknow which way is north.\" \"Hey, Big Dog,\nyour tails up.\" \"Thank you, Big Dog.\nEven though your body's stiff, you're\nstill so loyal. W I'll definitely avenge\nyou. Big dog, don't worry. I will\ndefinitely survive. Trembling, a little\nlace stockings activated her innate\nability and hurriedly fled in the\ndirection pointed to by the werewolf\ncaptain's raised tail. Chapter 43. Heay\nand Tu Shan by Chin on the run. Hateful.\nDamn it, Gene Dang. You actually let\nthat white stocking lowly get away.\nWhat's your harpy doing here? Xiao\nDatang kicked away a werewolf corpse on\nthe ground in dissatisfaction and said,\n\"We used stealth spells and disguised\nall our troops like monsters, surrounded\nthe territory, and still the white\nstocking lowly escaped.\" \"I was about to\ntake my pants off, and you let them get\naway. Just shut up,\" Gene Dang said with\nan unfriendly expression. The harpy\nreported that she didn't see any humans\nfleeing. \"Maybe that woman's lordly\ntalent is invisibility.\"\nInvisibility. You think invisibility is\na common talent? Xiao Dataong said\nangrily. Every individual with the\ntalent for stealth is considered a top\ntier player, someone that all countries\nwould prioritize protecting. Would they\nonly bring two elite squads of\nwerewolves as their main force. While\nZiao Daong was still fuming, a harpy\nflew back and whispered a few words in\nGene Dangs ear. Gene Dangs eyes lit up.\nThe harpy discovered escape footprints.\nThey're heading towards where that\nskinny lord and the flower fairy\nsoldiers were. Go after them. We can\ntake care of them at the same time.\nMeanwhile, on the other side, two thin\nmen in school uniforms with even darker\ndark circles under their eyes. He were\ncarrying a bow and leading a large group\nof beautiful flower fairies to clear\nland near his territory. My lord, this\nplace is excellent. I'm sure there are\nsome easy monsters to deal with here.\nNot difficult to deal with. Great.\nGreat. Then we'll all attack together\nlater so you don't get hurt. Yay! The\nLord is the best to us.\" The flower\nfairies cheered, and sure enough, the\nscouts discovered a fine iron or vein\nahead where dozens of hyenas were\nentrenched. \"My lord, the demons have\ngone.\" The flower fairies swarmed\nforward, gracefully, flying low and\nscattering poisonous seeds as they\nbattled the ordinary level wild monster,\nthe hyena. Heay quickly drew his\nlongbow, wanting to help. At that\nmoment, a pure white beastlike figure\nsuddenly rushed from his side. Heay was\ncaught off guard and knocked down. Hey,\nprotect the lord. Flower fairies quickly\nflew out and rushed towards Heay. He was\nquick enough to do it. He rolled over,\nstood up, drew his bow, and aimed at the\nbeast. The next second, he froze. How\ncome it's a white stocking lowly? The\nwhite stocking lowly who bumped into\nsomeone was also dizzy. After struggling\nto get up, she saw Heay pointing a bow\nand arrow at her. And a group of slender\nand beautiful flower fairies wearing\nonly a few leaves were eyeing her\nmenacingly. Uh, don't kill me. I'm the\nLord next door. I'm pretty. I can warm\nyour bed. I can be cute and I can whine\nto cheer you on. Nearby protested, we\ncan do it too. Lord, kill her. Heay put\ndown his bow and arrow and asked in\nconfusion, \"A pretty girl?\" The white\nstocking lowly stood with her hands on\nher hips, stomped her foot angrily, and\nher ample bosom and animal ears swayed\nback and forth. What kind of pretty girl\nis this? My name is Tu Shan by Chien.\nAnd another thing, when I said I was\nsomewhat pretty, I was being modest. I'm\nactually super beautiful. Okay. Eay said\nhelplessly, \"Hey, pretty girl, what are\nyou doing here? You can legally kill\nsomeone who invades your territory\nwithout cause. Upon hearing this, the\nlittle girl in white silk finally\nremembered what she needed to do. She\nimmediately pouted and burst into tears,\nfeeling wronged. Brother, please take me\nin. My house has been overrun by\nmonsters. Dozens of extremely ferocious\nmonsters killed all my troops. I was the\nonly one who escaped. Wait, what did you\nsay? Monsters? They've breached your\nlord's manner. Heay immediately became\nvery nervous. Where is your territory?\nHow did you get here? Tan by Chin said,\n\"I used my innate skill to escape here.\nI ran for half an hour. That means your\nterritory is right next to mine.\" He was\neven more surprised. Since the monsters\nhave come to your territory, they might\ncome to mine. Damn it. I thought I was\nthe chosen one, but how come my luck is\nso bad? Of all the times I ran into a\nmonster running around everywhere.\nSisters, demons, hurry back to the\nterritory. With the new walls I built\naround the Lord's manor, we might be\nable to hold out. Without further ado,\nHeay pulled Tan by Chin toward the\nLord's mansion. Hey, you. Why are you\ngrabbing this girl's hand for no reason?\nTu Shan by Chin slapped Heay's hand\naway. Oh, sorry. It's just a habit. Heay\nscratched his head. There are just too\nmany beautiful women around me. Too\nShawn by Chin pouted. No matter how many\nwomen there are, none are as beautiful\nas my little sister. You must have been\nlusting after her. The flower fairies\nguarding Heay on the side were unhappy\nagain. The demons are clearly the\nprettiest. The demons are flexible and\nthey can even fly. You're only big in\nthe chest. You can't even fly. Heay\nquickly tried to smooth things over. All\nright. All right. You two are like Fen\nand Yongu Fei. Each beautiful in your\nown way. By the way, beautiful lady,\nwhat kind of monster attacked you? Tu\nShan Bian thought for a while and said,\n\"I didn't see it clearly. I only saw\nthat some of the demons were female\ndemons with bat wings, but no hands, and\nthey could fly. And then there are the\nred-skinned monsters with ugly fangs,\ntall stature, who wield axes and drool\nat the sight of any young girl. Uggh. So\ndisgusting. Drooling when you see me?\nAre you sure such a monster exists? Or\nis the drool actually coming from me?\nUggh. How can you say such awful things?\nEay pondered for a moment. The monsters\nyou're describing seem to be harpies and\norc veterans, except the harpies have\nfeathered wings and the orcs have green\nskin. Could it be a result of the\ndemonic tide infection and mutation? But\nthis group seems kind of familiar. As\nthe two talked, they were about to\narrive at the gate of Heizay's\nterritory. Just then, a piercing scream\nrang out. Lord, run, there's an ambush.\nThen came a loud bang. As the group\nstood there in a days, a frustrated\nvoice rang out. Damn it, what bad luck.\nI didn't even get a chance to have some\nfun. Quick, everyone, rush out. Don't\nlet a single one escape. capture the\nflower fairy and that white stocking\nlowly and ravaged them mercilessly.\nImmediately, a large group of monsters\nrushed out from behind the walls of\nHezy's territory. Red orcs, harpies with\nbat wings, giant lizards, and giant\nboores. They all look to be at least\nelite units. Damn it, they're already at\nmy doorstep. Run. He grabbed Tu Shawn by\nChin and turned to Ron, but\nunfortunately, he was no match for the\nambushers. It was only a matter of time\nbefore he was caught. A flower fairy\nflew out. My lord, I have no regrets in\nthis life for knowing you. Please forget\nabout me and live a good life. Having\nsaid that, without waiting for Heiz's\nresponse, the flower demon flew straight\ntowards the enemy who was chasing after\nher with a sinister grin. The red and\ngreen orcs eyes gleamed with cruelty.\nThey were about to have a good taste of\nthis flower fairy. The flower fairy\nflapped her wings, scattering poisonous\nseeds, and fought fiercely with the\nbeastmen for several rounds. Finally,\nexhausted and unable to withstand the\nbeastmen, she was captured alive. Then,\nwith a loud bang, it exploded. Yao Yao\nthe flower fairy used her\nself-destruction to halt the pursuer's\nadvance. He wanted to cry, but had no\ntears, so he could only grit his teeth\nand run away. Tan by Chiian was also\nmoved to tears by this touching scene,\nwiping her eyes as she ran. And so,\namidst the roars of the pursuers, one\nflower fairy after another rushed\nforward, risking their lives to buy heay\ntime to escape. Which way should we run?\nThe north. Tu Shan by Chin replied.\nThat's what my captain of the guard told\nme before he died. Then run north. W you\nbastards. You bastards. You bastards.\nDon't worry. I will definitely avenge\nyou. Then he began to mutter to himself.\n1 2 3 77. I still have 77 left. Bang.\n76. I still have 76 demons left. I can\nescape. Tan by Chin was stunned for a\nmoment. Ugg. You're so heartless. You\nscumbag. Usually naive and silly girl\nsuddenly became very clever and she\nscreamed. You're actually calculating\nhow many more flower fairies you can use\nto buy yourself time. How could you\ntreat a soldier who loves you so deeply\nlike this? He a rolled his eyes at the\npretty girl next to him and slowly said\n77. Chapter 44. Lyn Sha, I've discovered\nyour secret. Tan by Chian immediately\nfell silent. She was afraid that the\nthin man in front of her, wearing a\nschool uniform and with darker dark\ncircles under his eyes than a master of\ntime management, would push her out to\ntake the blow. After all, he was a\nscumbag who didn't even care when his\nown beautiful flower fairy died, and she\nknew absolutely nothing about him. This\nscumbag even knows he's a pretty girl.\nIt's infuriating that she never reveals\nher ID when they chat. What exactly did\nI do that gave me away? The two remained\nsilent, gritting their teeth as they ran\nnorth. Finally, amidst the continuous\nbanging sounds, the two new lords shook\noff their pursuers. But there were only\n23 fluttering flower fairies around him.\nTell me, what's the point of running all\nthe way north? Tu Shawn Bachin said\nbreathlessly, \"My little sister doesn't\neven have a lord's mansion anymore. How\ncan she make a comeback? How can she\navenge the fallen soldiers?\" Heay said\nnonchalantly. If there's no Lord's\nmanor, we can come back next year. The\nmost important thing right now is to\nsave your life. At worst, even without a\nlord's manner, we can still become\nwandering night errant lords like Lyn\nSha. At this moment, Lyn Sha, the least\nsuccessful of the wandering lords in\neveryone's eyes, had just completed the\nconstruction of a level one lord's manor\nand unlocked the farmhouse. Farmhouse\nquality average output ordinary quality\nfarmers. Time recruit one or two per day\nevery half day. Click to start\nrecruitment. Resources consumed. 50\nunits of food are required as a\nrecruitment fee for each farmer and the\nlord will bear the subsequent living\nexpenses. Note one house is required for\nevery 10 farmers and the number of\nfarmers must not exceed the maximum\npopulation capacity of the lord's manor.\nThis is the farmhouse. Once you have a\nfarmhouse, it will continuously recruit\nfarmers from the other world, allowing\nyou to recruit farmers without needing a\ncitizen token. However, the territory\nmust also meet the requirement of having\nhousing for farmers to live in. As for\nthe maximum population capacity,\nLynhiao's level one legendary quality\nlord's mansion can only support 10,000\npeople. There's no need to worry about\nreaching the limit in the short term.\nThe rate of recruiting one ordinary\nfarmer a day is still too slow. Even\nwith Lin Xiao's talent increasing\nrecruitment speed by 100% and output by\n100%, it is still not enough. Such a\nfarmhouse is simply not enough to meet\nLyn Xiao's goal of becoming number one\nin the newbie zone. Use Hasha token\nascension to consume one energy point\nand ascend the quality of your\nfarmhouse. Lynn Shiao decisively used\nthe sublimation function of his cheat\nhasha token function. Ascension consumes\none energy point to use the ascension\nability, upgrading any item/skll/un/hero\nquality to the highest level. Energy 1/1\nautomatically recharges every 24 hours.\nLyn Shiao had already calculated it\nsince the last use of the ascended\nlord's mansion. Ascending the spirit\nfield, pond, blacksmith shop, and pond\nis no longer in the best interest.\nUpgrading a single peasant or phantom\narcher to legendary quality would be too\nwasteful. As for the Mod Dao iron\nguards, the divine arm bow archers, Pay\nMin, and Bao Sea, they are all of the\nhighest quality and do not need to be\nupgraded. Therefore, upgrading a\nproductive building, a farmhouse, is the\nmost cost-effective option. A flash of\ngolden light appeared and a simple\nthatched farmhouse immediately\ntransformed in the light. In a short\nwhile, a building resembling a luxurious\ncountry villa with a gold colored\nexterior appeared. Farmhouse quality\ngolden legend output legendary quality\nfarmer. Time recruit one or two per hour\nevery 30 minutes. Click to start\nrecruitment. Resources consumed. 500\nrecruitment fee. Subsequent living\nexpenses will be borne by the Lord.\nNote, one house is required for every 10\nfarmers, and the number of farmers must\nnot exceed the maximum population\ncapacity of the Lord's Manor. Lyn Sha\nimmediately clicked to recruit 20. The\nrecruitment should be completed in about\n5 hours. The territo's stored grain\ntotaling over 10,000 units of spirit\nrice was immediately consumed by the\nmajority by the fact that legendary\nfarmers are 10 times more expensive than\nordinary farmers. Their abilities and\nvalue far surpass those of ordinary\nfarmers, making them highly coveted by\nmany lords in official servers. It all\ncomes down to one thing. A legendary\nfarmer can cultivate a legendary spirit\nfield on their own. And that value far\nexceeds the cost of recruiting farmers.\nTherefore, Lynn Sha would rather spend\nmost of his stored grain than not\nactivate the legendary level farmers\nfirst. In the future, farmers will be\nable to do everything they need.\nCultivate farmland, mine minerals, build\nstructures, cook, and even work as\nblacksmiths, or take on other part-time\njobs. While waiting to recruit farmers,\nLynn Shia went to the auction house\nagain to look for the items he wanted.\nStill, no one is selling life-saving\nhealing potions. No one has contacted me\nabout the price. Maybe I need to spread\nthe word a bit more. Retrieve the\nequipment that his men, including Tangg\nYi, S Ruer, Saulin, and Pay Min had\nobtained and automatically stored in the\nmain God systems warehouse. While Lin\nSha was at home building things, the\nfour armies collectively acquired a\ncommon spirit field, a fine quality\nbreastplate, and a fine quality leg\narmor. Baosi's skills seemed to have\nslightly reduced my luck against the\nheavens, but it is still above that of\nordinary people. Lyn Sha felt a little\nmore at ease. As long as he continued to\nwin over Baoi and got through the novice\nperiod, Baoi, who had transformed into a\nperson with positive fortune, could help\nhis fortune advance even further. As for\nthis junk, sell it all. Lyn Shao turned\naround and put all the items, the\nordinary spirit field, the fine\nbreastplate, and the fine leg guards up\nfor auction. A new message has been\nadded under all the items for sale.\nLooking to buy life healing potion.\nPlease message me with your price. Thank\nyou. Aa bastard. Bastard. Suddenly\nappearing, Ziao Daang was covered in\nblood. With a fierce thrust of his\nsword, he pierced through the astonished\nman in front of him. He was a young man\ndressed in the clothes of the dragon\nkingdom. He's the lord of the newbie\nzone. What? It was the human lord who\nkilled me. Before the young man could\nfinish speaking, Ziao Datang struck\nagain with his sword. Blood splattered\neverywhere. Ding. Newbie zone number\n89757.\nPlayer Kong has been eliminated. Ask\nyour mother. I didn't get a single\nflower demon or white silk. I even lost\nan orc and injured a lizard rider\nbecause of the flower demons\nself-destruction. Can a human lord kill\nyou? Xiao. Daong appeared to be insane,\nwielding his sword again and again,\nseemingly trying to vent all the anger\nhe had felt that day. All right, Datang,\ncalm down for a bit. Gene Dang standing\nto the side said coldly. Because you\nhaven't satisfied your desires, you've\nalready slaughtered all three lords next\nto the skinny boy. You've dropped two\nmore rare recruitment tokens and a life\nhealing potion, and I've dropped a\npurple weapon, the black wind axe. Your\ntemper should have subsided a bit by\nnow. Upon hearing Gene Dang mention his\nincredible luck, Ziao Datang slowly\nstopped chopping and revealed a\nferocious smile. Slaughtering your own\nkind increases the drop rate, but I need\nto take care of either the skinny kid or\nthat little girl before I can calm down.\nAfter saying that, he turned his head,\nlooked around, and sneered. I can't find\nany trace of those two people in any of\nthe three locations. It seems they ran\nto the last direction. Lyn Shia, I'll\nmake you feel better if I do it. I'll\ngive you a good scolding when I log on.\nXiao Daong entered the chat channel,\nglanced at the chat history briefly, and\nnarrowed his eyes slightly. Lin Shiao is\ntrying to buy life-healing potions.\nWhat's he doing? Is he injured? As if\nremembering something, Ziao Datang\nimmediately went into the auction house\nand began searching. Sure enough, all\nsix items Lin Shia had listed in the\nauction house were marked with seeking\nlife healing potion, can be used as a\ndiscount in gold coins, and included a\nprice tag of am. After hesitating for a\nfew seconds, Ziao Datang&lt;unk&gt;s\nexpression became increasingly\nferocious. Haha, Lynsha, I've discovered\nyour secret. Chapter 45. What are you\nbarking like a dog? Haha, Lyn Sha, I've\ndiscovered your secret. Xiao Datong\nlooked up at the sky and roared,\nattracting the attention of Gene Dang.\nDaong, what's wrong? That kid Lynn Shiao\ncan't hold on any longer. Xiao Dong\nsneered. He's been asking for life\nhealing potions across the entire chat\nchannel. He's even added notes to all\nthe items he's listing on the auction\nhouse, saying he wants to buy life\nhealing potions. Gene Dang, including\nthat black long sword with the\ninscription, children of destiny and\ndogs cannot purchase. Xiao, shut up.\nBasically, we're just scrambling to buy\nmedicine. This kid must have suffered a\nserious injury. the kind that can't be\nslowly healed inside the territory. Lynn\nShiao is the first place winner of the\nLong Non District Martial Arts\nCompetition. His martial arts skills\nmust be very high, no less than those of\nrare soldiers, and may even reach the\nlevel of outstanding soldiers. His\nability to break records and earn extra\nhero rewards as a ranger lord, and his\nsuccessful defense against the demonic\ntide is enough to demonstrate his\nexceptional combat prowess. I knew it.\nHow could a new lord with only ordinary\nrecruitment tokens and ordinary heroes\nbe so arrogant for so long and get so\nmuch equipment? Six pieces. He must have\nsold all of his equipment. It turns out\nhe was the one who charged into battle\nand now he's seriously injured. I was a\nlittle worried at first. Lynn Shiao has\nfew soldiers, so he will definitely\nprioritize upgrading himself. Maybe he\nis already level seven or eight. We\nmight have to lose a small squad of rare\ntroops to take him down, but now it\nseems like we have it in the bag. Xiao\nDatangs expression grew increasingly\nferocious. Now I'm going to tear him\napart and ravage him in front of\neveryone. Let everyone know that I'm not\nsomeone to be trifled with. Just as Gene\nDang was still puzzled, Ziao Datang\nimmediately sent a private message to\nLyn Sha. Lyn Sha, do you want the life\nhealing potion? Click to view. Come to\nthe public channel to get it. Then\nwithout waiting for Lin Ziao's reply,\nZhiao Datang spoke on the public\nchannel. Life healing potion for sale,\n10,000 gold coins per bottle, Lin Shia\nand dogs are not allowed to purchase at\nLin Shiao. Do you want to buy it? Come\nand buy it. The chat channel, which had\nbeen quite lively, fell silent again.\nEveryone is watching Xiao Daong&lt;unk&gt;s\nrevenge battle. A few minutes passed.\nThe expected reaction of Lin Sha filled\nwith regret and remorse did not occur.\nLyn Sha did not even acknowledge Xiao\nDatong. Xiao Datong, he Lin Shiao,\nyou're too scared to speak now. Trying\nto buy it from someone else. Let me tell\nyou this. Anyone who dares to sell the\nlife healing potion to Lin Shiao is an\nenemy of me. Xiao Datong and Gene Dang.\nLin Sha, you won't get it from me. Lyn\nShia, answer me. Still no one answered.\nZiao Daong Lin Sha, aren't you going to\nanswer me? Let's see how long you can\nkeep up this act. If you kneel down and\ncow out to me on live stream and\napologize, offering me the black long\nsword with both hands, I might spare\nyour life. Oh no. Even if you give me\nthe black long sword, I won't spare you.\nIt's too late. You've repeatedly ignored\nmy attempts to win you over and trampled\non my dignity. You must die. At Lyn Sha,\nyou're too arrogant. Do you think the\nbattlefield of 10,000 races is still\nyour lousy school where someone can\nshelter you from the wind and rain? and\nwhere you can cry to your teacher if you\nlose. Too bad you're too green. I've\nalready discovered your secret. You're\ninjured. Severely injured. You actually\nwent to the chat channel and auction\nhouse to buy life healing potions and\neven left messages on all the items as\nif you wanted everyone to know you were\ninjured. Xiao Daton grinned maliciously.\nHe wanted to expose Lin Xiao's secret to\nthe public, let everyone see it, and\nmake Lin Shia lose face. What? The chat\nchannel immediately buzzed with\nexcitement. Lyn Shia was seriously\ninjured. No wonder. No wonder he was in\nsuch a hurry to buy life restoring\nmedicine. I knew it. So many lords died\nduring that kind of demonic tide like\nthe meteor shower. How could Lyn Sha\npossibly survive? He's not some big shot\nlike Ding Lay. It looks like Lynn Shia\nis in deep trouble now. He either needs\nto withdraw early or he'll die on the\nbattlefield of the myriad races. Quite a\nfew people have died today alone.\nDinglay. Everyone, don't talk nonsense.\nWe're all from the same district. We\nshould give Lin Sha more encouragement\nand courage. The most brilliant student\nfrom Jangdong number three middle school\nis seriously injured and cannot\nparticipate in the newbie rankings with\nme. Everyone said Dinglay is indeed\nkind-hearted. Even in this situation, he\nstill wants to take care of Lyn Shao.\nDinglay. Lin Shiao is also a super\nacademic genius, so everyone should show\nhim some respect. Academic genius. Lyn\nXiao&lt;unk&gt;'s F-level talent already\ndestined him to never reach the same\nlevel as Ding Lay. By the way, Dinglay,\nhave you recruited your first hero yet?\nDinglay? He he I'm not very talented,\nbut I'll be able to recruit heroes soon.\nI'll probably be number one in our\nregion. No, number two. Wow. No wonder\nyou're a pro. That's real skill.\nrecruiting heroes on only the second day\nafter the server opened. I haven't even\nstarted upgrading my lord's mansion yet.\nHe he that's right, that sight. Lyn\nXiao's record-breaking performance and\nbeing the first to recruit a hero are\njust luck. Look at him now. He's\nseriously injured and desperately\nseeking medicine. That's right. The true\ntest of a genius lies in the battlefield\nof all races. The most impressive are\nthose like Ding Lay who are known for\ntheir composure. Seeing the debate in\nthe chat channel, Ziao Daong was\noverjoyed. Even though Lynn Sha did not\nreply, but most people are mocking Lyn\nShao, he has been isolated. So Xiao\nDataong struck while the iron was hot.\nLyn Sha, do you see that? A wandering\nnight errant like you, relying on your\nmarshall prowess, is doomed to die if\nyou get injured. You, a powerless and\ninsignificant person, dare to be so\narrogant on the battlefield of all\nraces, not taking me seriously at all. I\nrespect your F-level talent and your\ncourage to venture into the battlefield\nof 10,000 races. You're a real man. I've\nshown you kindness several times, but\nyou didn't appreciate it and dared to\nhumiliate me again and again. A scholar\ncan be killed, but not humiliated.\nToday, I'm going to announce this to the\nentire district. Lord Xiao Daong and\nGene Dang alliance. Use the punishment\ntalisman to punish Lord Lin Sha.\nEffective immediately. Lyn Sha prepare\nto die. Gentlemen, watch how I get rid\nof this shameless scoundrel. The words\nshocked the entire district. Dinglay.\nXiao Datong. Isn't this inappropriate?\nXiao Datong, I have the extermination\ntalisman. I'm within the rules of the\nbattlefield. I can deal with whomever I\nwant. Dingle. But we're all from the\nsame district and we're all from Lia.\nXiaoangi Dinglay. The battlefield of\n10,000 races is not child's play. It's a\nreal battlefield. Every contestant who\nenters the battlefield of 10,000 races\nhas signed a life or death waiver. The\nDragia Kingdom trained us to be\nqualified warriors and qualified lords\nso that we could fight for the interests\nof the Dragia Kingdom. This is not a\nplace for sentimentality. It is a place\nof ruthless slaughter. Lynn Shiao has\nrepeatedly insulted me as a dog, and\nLynn Shia must pay the price. Dinglay\nsai. All right, colleagues, as you've\nall seen, it's not that I don't want to\nhelp, but the battlefield of the myriad\nraces is definitely not a place for\nleisure and vacation. Perhaps we do need\nsome bloody lessons to make everyone\nrealize the cruelty of the battlefield\nmore quickly. I have no objection. Upon\nseeing this, Xiao Daong snorted coldly.\nLyn Sha was tagged again. Lynn Shiao,\nyou're just waiting to die.\nSurprisingly, Lyn Sha actually replied\nthis time. He slowly typed out a\nquestion mark.\nEh, what are you barking about like\ndogs? Chapter 46. I'm not targeting\nanyone in particular. I mean, what are\nyou barking like a dog? The sudden\nappearance of the words caught everyone\noffguard. Lyn Sha, you actually dared to\nreply. You dared to curse me. You wait.\nI'll cut you into a thousand pieces and\ntorture your heroine to death. Ziao\nDaong jumped up and cursed angrily like\na mouse whose tail had been stepped on.\nDinglay Lyn Shiao. That's great. The\nfact that you can still reply to\nmessages when we meet means you're in\ngood shape. By the way, were you cursing\nat me just now? You must have\nmisunderstood. I was trying to help you.\nLook, I even told everyone to encourage\nyou, and I was still trying to persuade\nDaong not to target you. Before Lin\nShiao could reply, Xiao Daong jumped in\nagain. Lynn Shiao, no one can persuade\nme now. You're dead today. Let me tell\nyou the truth. I'm leading my troops and\nI'm about to enter your territory. Haha.\nDidn't expect that, did you? Lyn Sha\nsaid calmly. and howl as you please\noutside, but if anyone dares to invade\nmy territory, I will kill them without\nmercy. Dinglay Lynn Shiao, try to speak\nmore peacefully. To be fair, you're\nbeing too aggressive with your insults.\nWho are you referring to as you all? Who\nis barking wildly? Who are you calling a\ndog? Don't include everyone else. It's\neasy to incite public anger. Lyn Shia,\nI'm sorry, Ding Lay, that's more like\nit. Actually, there are still many\npeople willing to help you. If you\nreally can't hold on, it's not\nimpossible for you to bow your head and\napologize to Xiao Daong. Shake hands and\nmake peace. I will mediate and do my\nbest to accommodate you both. Lyn Shia,\nI'm not targeting you, Dinglay. I'm\nsaying that everyone who mocked me just\nnow is a dog. The chat channel instantly\nexploded. The insults and ridicule came\ncrashing down again. Xiao Data Ha, still\npretending. Still pretending today I'll\nlet you die knowing why. D Chong begin.\nDing. Contestant Gene Dang has created a\nlive stream room. Xiao Dataong.\nEveryone, we've created a live stream\nroom. If you have money, please support\nus financially. If you don't, please\nshow your support by being there. Let's\nsee how I deal with this arrogant brat\nwho thinks he can do no good. In an\ninstant, thousands of people flooded\ninto the live stream, and the number was\nstill rising rapidly. When the audience\nsaw the strength of Ziao Daong and Gene\nDashangs troops, they all gasped in\nshock. Orc veteran, a rare unit. Lizard\nCavalry, a rare unit. Harpy, a rare\nunit. Hog Rider, a rare unit. Troll head\nhunters, a rare ranged unit. Two squads.\nThere are six rare unit teams in total\nwith over 50 members. This is only the\nsecond day in the newbie zone. holding a\nhuge ax in his hand. Zhiao Datong said\nsmuggly, \"Thanks for your support,\neveryone. This is a rare level weapon,\nthe Black Wind Axe.\" Everyone was\nshocked. Zhiao Datang actually possessed\na rare level weapon. Everyone, I'm\nalready level seven. D Chong is already\nlevel eight with the two of us and over\n50 rare troops. Is this rare level\nweapon enough to take down Lin Shiao?\nEveryone was shocked, both by the high\nlevel of the two men and by their\nsuperior strength and weaponry.\nImmediately, Ziao Daong and Gene Dang\nswaggered towards Lin Xiao's territory,\nright under the gaze of thousands of\npeople in the live broadcast room. Just\nas Xiao Daong entered Dang, the two of\nthem were singing in their live stream\nas they headed towards their\ndestination. The skinny boy Heay and the\nwhite stocking lowly Tu Shawn by Chin\nalso rashly and hastily led 23 flower\nfairies to an unfamiliar place. The two\nof them are now in a mountainous area.\nAt this moment, the two were even in a\nmonster's lair looking down the\nmountain. Surprisingly, they didn't\nencounter a single monster along the\nway. Occasionally, you can see traces of\nmonster blood on the ground that haven't\nyet been refreshed by the main god\nsystem. Due to the distance and the fog\nof war, he couldn't see anything\nclearly. But Tu Shan by Chin was looking\ninto the distance with great interest,\nseemingly unaffected. Wow, whose manner\nis this? It's&lt;unk&gt; not big, but it's\njust what I like. Tu Shan by Chin asked\nin disbelief, her eyes shining. You can\nreally see it. He asked irritably.\nDoesn't the fog of war affect you? Of\ncourse, my sister can see it. Tu Shan by\nChian didn't explain, but instead\nmuttered to herself. This territory is\nlocated at the mouth of a gourd with the\nmain gate facing directly outwards. The\nentire interior of Gourd Mountain is\nblocked by this territory, essentially\nmaking it the Lord's backyard. Excellent\nterrain. The territory is roughly\nestimated to be tens of thousands of\nsquare meters. Only such a large area\ncan just block the mountain pass. But\nthis area is too big for a beginner's\narea. I've never heard of such a thing\nbefore. He a rolled his eyes at Tu Sha\nby Chen thinking, \"I didn't expect you,\nthis big- breasted, brainless girl to\nknow about these strategic things.\" Tu\nSha by Chin replied irritably, \"Of\ncourse I understand. I'm the top student\nin our school strategy class.\" And then\ncontinued to look around. The territory\nhas been walled off and construction is\nstill underway inside. There are quite a\nfew farmers but not many soldiers. Tu\nShan by Chin suddenly exclaimed. What's\nwrong? What did you see? He a asked\nanxiously. I saw a really handsome guy.\nUggh. Girls shouldn't swear, but I saw a\nreally handsome guy. He's so\ngood-looking. Seeing Tu Shawn by Chin's\ninfatuated expression, Heay rolled his\neyes, opened the chat channel, and\nplanned to see what the latest news was.\nImmediately, he saw the news that Xiao\nDaong and Gene Dang were attacking Lin\nShiao and had started a live broadcast.\nThis Lin Sha is really tough. He's got\nguts. Heay shook his head and clicked\ninto the live stream. He was stunned as\nsoon as he entered the live stream. The\nreason is simple. He was all too\nfamiliar with the soldiers under Xiao\nDatangs command. Orc veterans, harpies,\nlizard riders, boar riders, all the same\nsize, all the same appearance. These\nunits even have bits of paint still on\nthem. Only the red has turned green. It\nwas him. He killed my Yao Yao. It was\nXiao Datong. He&lt;unk&gt;s body began to\ntremble uncontrollably. What? Tu Shan by\nChian looked over curiously and he\nimmediately told her about the live\nstream. Tan by Chin also immediately\nentered the live broadcast room. Uggh.\nThose monsters are actually Ziao Daong\nsoldiers. I'm so angry. They even wanted\nto rape the younger sister first and\nthen Well, that's a really scary thing.\nNo, I must expose them. The live stream\nwas filled with flattery. Two big shots\nwith strong and welle equipped troops.\nLyn Shia will surely flee at the mere\nmention of their names. Huh, bro? Xiao\nDatang said disdainfully, \"We've all\nused our innate abilities to secretly\nsurvey their terrain. It's inside a\ngourdshaped opening. It's surrounded by\nmountains on three sides with only one\nroad in front and nowhere else to run.\nThat arrogant brat is definitely going\nto get a good beating from those two big\nshots. Huh? Let that kid be so arrogant,\ndaring to insult anyone. After you two\nget rid of that arrogant brat, we&lt;unk&gt;ll\nstill need your help to eliminate the\nremaining demons. He Heihi, it's&lt;unk&gt;\nnothing. Just as Xiao Datong was feeling\ndizzy from being slapped by Ma Di, a\ndiscordant voice suddenly jumped out to\noppose him. Don't be fooled. Xiao\nDatangs troops are monsters. They're the\nones who destroyed my little sister's\nhome. They killed all their soldiers.\nOnly my little sister survived. Xiao\nDatang. Who do you think you\nare? I just wiped out the family of a\nwhite stocking lowly. The attractive\ngirl said, \"I'm wearing white stockings.\nYou pervert.\" The live stream room fell\nsilent instantly. \"Was it the pretty\ngirl?\" That vain and narcissistic woman\nhad been silent for several hours. It\nturns out she was attacked by Ziao\nDaong's troops disguised as monsters.\nEay, I can testify. Xiao Datong and Gene\nDang disguised their troops as demons,\nattacked the beautiful girl, and then\ncame to kill me. I almost lost my entire\narmy, and only about 20 flower fairies\nwere left. Xiao Datang, you're that\nskinny kid. Damn it, I didn't even get\nto enjoy one of those flower fairies.\nThey all self-destructed. Gene Dang, I\nthought to myself, what a brainless\nfatso. Everyone thought to themselves,\nisn't this just admitting that he did\nit? Just as Gene Dang was sweating\nprofusely, unsure how to handle the\nsituation, Ding Lay spoke up in the live\nbroadcast room. Listen to both sides of\nthe story and you will be enlightened. I\nthink everyone should not believe\nanyone's one-sided account. To be fair,\nthere have been a lot of monsters\nlately. It's possible that Zei and Hezy\nwere being chased and their territory\ndestroyed by monsters. In their panic,\nthey mistook the attackers for the\nattackers. Isn't that right, everyone?\nDing. Dingle has gifted Gene to Shang's\nlive stream with 1,000 gold coins.\nChapter 47. The big breasted brainless\nTu Shawn by Chien the Phantom Archer\nexposed. Dinglays remarks immediately\ndrew a chorus of approval. Exactly. You\ntwo. One is a man who talks nonsense and\nnever listens, and the other is a super\nnarcissistic woman who only knows how to\npimp. Who knows what you're thinking?\nAre you trying to ride the wave of\npopularity from the live stream? Ding.\nHoned Gene Dang's live stream with 50\ngold coins. Ding. Yi Hong has gifted\nGene Dangs live stream with a rocket.\nThe live stream was buzzing again, but\nthis time there were more and more\npeople condemning and doubting the two.\nTan Bian was so anxious she was about to\ncry. What do I have to say for you to\nbelieve me? Datang, stunning girl. You\nsay I attacked you, but what proof do\nyou have? Why wasn't your lord's manor\ncaptured by me? You? Because you\nattacked my lord's manor. The god system\nwill issue a regionwide announcement.\nWhat types of troops do you have? I have\ntwo teams of elitewolves.\nZiao. H just two squads of elite\nwerewolves. You think you can handle so\nmany of our rare units and still escape\nfrom the fog of war and the surrounding\nmonsters? Too sh. Because my lord's\ntalent is mutation, which allows me to\ntransform into a beast and escape. It\nallows me to see through the fog. It\nallows me to avoid arousing the\nhostility of wild monsters. Tan by Chian\nregretted her words as soon as they left\nher mouth. But withdrawing it was\nuseless. Tens of thousands of eyes in\nthe live stream had already seen it,\nincluding Lin Shia, who was watching\nsilently in the live stream. Lynn Shiao\ncouldn't help but curl his lips,\nthinking to himself that this pretty\ngirl's brains were comparable to Xiao\nDatangs. Truly a hidden dragon and a\nphoenix chick. Ziao Datang chuckled and\nsaid to the live stream audience, \"You\ncan see through the fog. I don't believe\nit. Tell me, where are you right now?\"\nTu Shan by Chian, I am currently at the\nentrance to Calabash Mountain, and below\nis a lord's territory. Upon hearing Hulu\nCo. Xiao Datong and Gene Dang exchanged\na glance. Gene Dang gave an\nexaggeratedly disdainful laugh on the\nlive stream screen and said, \"You're\njust making up some random place to fool\nus, aren't you?\" Tan by Chin stamped her\nfoot in frustration. \"I didn't. I saw\neverything clearly around the\nLord&lt;unk&gt;'s mansion.\" \"Oh, then tell me\nwhat's on this territory. There are\nquite a few farmers there. Are there any\ndefensive structures?\" No. What types of\ntroops are there? There were seven or\neight archers dressed in green clothes\nand green cloaks. Their ears were\npointed. Who is the lord? I don't know.\nHe's just really handsome. You're asking\nso many questions. Don't you believe me?\nHaha. Haha. In the live broadcast room,\nZiao Daong and Gene Dang were laughing\nso hard they were bent over. While Heay,\nwho was next to Tu Shan by Chien, was\ntoo late to stop her. Girl, don't you\nhave a brain here? Lynn Sha cursed under\nhis breath. He ran straight out of the\nlord&lt;unk&gt;'s mansion and looked around.\nHowever, because the archer was not\naround, he could not use his lord\nprivileges to borrow their eagle-eyed\nskill, so he could not see far away.\nThat big- breasted, brainless idiot girl\njust now revealed his location and his\nforces. The beautiful girl is nearby in\nmy territory. Lyn Sha hurriedly\nactivated his lord talent. Eternal\npeace. Use 1,000 points of battlefield\nenergy to exchange for Hashia token\nenergy. Activate God's perspective.\nLynho's vision was instantly elevated,\nand the thrill of seeing the entire map\nonce again enveloped this land. Soon,\nLynsha spotted those fertigures. 23\nbeautiful and slender flower fairies, a\nskinny boy in a school uniform, and a\nshort thin girl in white stockings with\na really big white rabbit. These must be\nthem. Lynn Shaol located the nearest\ngroup of archers led by Song Ruer and\nimmediately gave the order. Song Ruer,\ngo to these coordinates and bring back\neveryone here. Capture them alive. Song\nRuer and the others received the Lord's\norders directly in their minds and\nimmediately took action. Lin Shiao\nchanged his perspective again and saw\nXiao Daong Jin Dang and his groups\nswaggering towards his territory. Huh,\nthey actually dare to come? They must\nhave known my location and came straight\nhere. The massive force with nearly 60\nrare units would be terrifying to\nothers. But Lynn Shia didn't take it\nseriously at all. He could kill them as\nhe pleased. Since they dared to attack\nme, it means they intended to kill me\nand establish their authority by using\nme. If they attack my territory, killing\nthem all would not be excessive. Lyn Sha\nquickly considered the matter, nodded,\nand already had a plan in mind. He\nshifted his perspective, continued to\nrise, and soon found what he was looking\nfor. Those were the territories of\nseveral lords surrounding him. The\nlord's body lay scattered on the ground\nwith obvious signs of vandalism,\nlooting, and arson. If you only kill the\nlord, the system will only announce who\ndied. If you only plunder the warehouse,\nthe system will not make any\nannouncements. The invaders did not\noccupy the Lord's mansion in order to\nprevent the god system from announcing\nwho did it. This shows that the\nintruders were a group of bandits who\nkilled and looted and then ran away.\nThey were definitely not monsters. The\nmonsters are so destructive that they\nwill eventually destroy all the\nbuildings and then the god system will\ndeclare that the territory is now\nunclaimed. Lynho's gaze grew colder and\ncolder. He took several screenshots\nusing his god-like perspective. And just\nas he was about to log off, he spotted a\nsmall inconspicuous figure in the\ndistance. Meanwhile, in the live stream,\nso hard that tears were streaming down\ntheir faces. Harah, you beautiful girl.\nDon't you know you're right near Lin\nXiao's territory? Thank you for\nrevealing Lin Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s information to\nus. What did you just say? Lyn Sha has\nseven or eight long-eared archers in\ngreen. Huh? I thought Lyn Sha was some\nkind of wandering lord all alone. So, it\nturns out that only by having special\nmilitary units can we set records and\nresist the demonic tide. Does his lord's\nmanners still have any heroes? Beautiful\nlady, could you check and let me know?\nBy the way, where is the beautiful\nheroine? Tell me, is it beautiful or\nnot? Xiao Datong unleashed his full\npower, relentlessly mocking him.\nEveryone laughed and agreed. For a\nmoment, the live stream room was filled\nwith a joyful atmosphere. \"Hey, everyone\nin the live stream, what kind of unit is\nthat greenclad long-eared archer?\" Gene\nDatong asked casually with a laugh. The\nlive stream went silent. What? Nobody\nknows. The long-eared one is an elven\narcher, and the long-eared one is\nwearing green clothes. It's phantom\nshooter. Someone with better academic\nperformance commented in the live\nstream. Phantom shooters. There are\nseven or eight of them. Gene Dang\nmaintained his smile, but cold sweat\nsuddenly broke out on his face. Isn't\nthat an elite unit? Xiao Daong realized\nwhat was happening and exchanged\nbewildered glances with Gene Dang. I\nsee. I understand now. The viewers in\nthe live stream realized what was\nhappening and someone immediately jumped\nout to speak. The Phantom Archer is a\nneutral, leaning towards the benevolent\nfaction. Lynn Sha must have used his\npeace skill to reduce hostility and\nbewitch a team of Phantom Archers.\nCoupled with being born near a\nresourcerich area, he was able to clear\nthe wilderness quickly and accumulate\nresources. Thus, he became the first to\nupgrade his lord's mansion and set a\nrecord. That's right. That's what I\nthink, too. Phantom archers aren't good\nat close combat. While Lin Shiao is the\nnumber one in the Jangdong Province\nmartial arts competition, and his close\ncombat ability is no less than that of\nelite soldiers. With one melee fighter\nand one range fighter working together,\nthey're like a tiger with wings. The\ninsightful analysis was appreciated by\nmany viewers in the live stream,\nincluding Dinglay. Dinglay, excellent\nanalysis. This also explains how they\nsurvived the demonic tide. Lin Sha and\nhis hero melee fighters stood in front.\nThe phantom archer was behind. This\ncombination is indeed very powerful in\nthe beginner area. But this demonic tide\nwas too dangerous. As a result, Lyn\nXiao's first hero was killed and Lin\nShiao himself was seriously injured and\nhad to seek out life restoring potions.\nThe phantom archer was also reduced to\nonly seven or eight. That's right.\nThat's exactly it. Dingle is awesome.\nIt's like seeing it with my own eyes.\n666,666.\nDinglay. He simple analysis. It's just a\ntrivial skill. Basic operations are not\nto be taken lightly. Chapter 48. The\ntrump card is revealed. Come out and\nface your death. That's well said. Lyn\nSha also in the live stream thought to\nhimself expressionlessly. He didn't need\nto explain anything. Someone else would\nexplain everything for him. Now that\nthere are reasonable guesses about how\nhe got first place and how he set a\nrecord, it would be perfectly reasonable\nfor him to do anything else. Reporting\nto the Lord, a deep gruff voice rang out\nfrom outside the Lord&lt;unk&gt;'s mansion. It\nwas Song Ruer. Bring all 24 women and\none man here. Lyn Sha walked out of the\nLord&lt;unk&gt;'s mansion, his gaze gloomy.\nThere were 23 slender women with\ntransparent fairy wings and surrounded\nby green leaves. A thin young man in a\nschool uniform with dark circles under\nhis eyes and a little girl in a lolita\ndress, animal ears on her head and white\nstockings on her feet. It was the flower\nfairies he and the beautiful girl. The\npretty girl was still muttering to\nherself complaining to Heay. You your\nflower fairy self-destruction is pretty\npowerful. Why didn't you use them to\nself-destruct? and then escape. \"Idiot.\nThe ones capturing us are ranged units.\nWe&lt;unk&gt;ll just die if we charge in.\nWhat's the point of self-destructing?\"\nEay replied irritably. The flower\nfairies also glared angrily at the\nbeautiful girl with a creaking sound. As\nthe door opened, the surroundings\nquieted down. The flower fairy and the\nbeautiful girl noticed at the same time\nand immediately looked up where they saw\nLynsha. \"Wow, so handsome,\" the flower\nfairies exclaimed in unison. Handsome\nguy, you must be Lin Sha, the big boss.\nLet's add each other as friends. The\npretty girl immediately swooned. Lynn\nSha didn't give these people who had\ntrespassed on his territory and were so\ntalkative and brainless a friendly look\nand gave the order. Song Rule, tie all\nthese people up. Leave two phantom\narchers to guard them and eight phantom\narchers to defend the base. The rest of\nyou come with me. Lynn Shiao has already\nurgently mobilized Saulin, who will be\nback in 10 minutes at most. Saulin, with\n28 phantom archers, can defend against\nany invading enemy in conjunction with\nthe base's defenses. He say, \"You\nbeautiful girls. I'll deal with you when\nI get back. If you dare to spout any\nmore nonsense and reveal my information,\nI will kill you all to silence you.\" the\n10 divine arm archers who had just\nreturned along with 10 phantom archers\nand immediately walked out of the gate\nof his territory. Behind them came the\nvoices of a group of flower fairies.\nWow, he's so handsome even when he's\nangry. He's so handsome even when he's\nstern. Yao Yao really wants to be\npunished by him. Shut up. Have some\nbackbone, will you? He's angry voice\nechoed from afar. Meanwhile, the live\nstream criticizing Lin Shiao was in full\nswing. But the two parties involved,\nZiao Dataong and Gene Dang, were\nsomewhat hesitant. Damn it, they\nactually have some elite units, though\nthere are only seven or eight of them.\nIf we want to take them down, we'll\nprobably have to bleed a little. Xiao\nDatong muttered to himself, afraid of\nlosing face in the live broadcast. We\nmight even get ourselves killed, Gene\nDang thought faster. Our rare troops\nnumbering nearly 60 are definitely not\nafraid of eight elite troops. But those\nare the fastest firing phantom archers.\nPerhaps the two of us will lose a\nsignificant portion of our troops,\nlosing nearly half their strength. Was\nit worth it to kill Lyn Sha? As the two\nwhispered to each other, Dinglay\nsuddenly sighed in the live broadcast\nroom. Dinglay sigh. Lyn Sha, I advised\nyou to reconcile, but you wouldn't\nlisten. How can you fight them with so\nfew phantom archers? Phantom archers are\nphysically fragile and most vulnerable\nto close combat. Orc veterans can charge\nin and take down two of them at once.\nDespite its high rate of fire, it's\npractically useless against heavily\narmored tanks or enemies like ghosts and\nskeletons that are immune to arrows. Lyn\nShiao Lin Sha, what a pity. We were once\nequally famous, but it seems you are\ndestined to be forgotten. Xiao Daong and\nhis companions eyes lit up instantly.\nThey immediately thought of their props.\nBook of the Dead ability consumable.\nWhen used, it summons 20 elite skeleton\narchers and 20 elite skeleton warriors,\nall of which are level 10 rare quality\nunits. Duration 24 hours. It perfectly\ncounters Lin Xiao's Phantom Archer.\nSkeleton soldiers are just skeletons, so\narrows might not hit them. And even if\nthey do, they won't do much damage. Lyn\nShiao, don't think you're so great just\nbecause you have a few phantom archers.\nI'll tell you that luck is nothing\ncompared to true strength. Today, you\nmust die. Ziao Daong made a boastful\nstatement in the live stream, and Gene\nDuchang immediately used the book of the\ndead. A flash of dark light appeared and\n40 terrifying skeleton soldiers with\ngreen flames shooting out of their eyes\nimmediately emerged from the ground. The\nlive stream chat erupted in another\ngasp. Xiao Datang and Gene Dang actually\nhave a hidden trump card. They now have\na 100 rare units. My god. And this is\nonly the second day in the newbie zone.\nWho can resist them? And judging from\nthe flames in the eyes of these skeleton\nsoldiers, they're probably at least\nlevel 10. Lyn Shia, you're in trouble.\nThe enemy has ranged units and undead.\nYour phantom archers have no chance at\nall. Xiao Daong walked with his head\nheld high, wearing a fine suit of armor\nand holding the rare weapon Black Wind\nAxe. He led nearly a 100 rare soldiers\non the main road. Not far away was Hulu\nPass. He said to the live stream\nviewers, \"Brothers, I'm almost there.\nWatch me wipe out Lin Shia. If you like\nit, give me a like, comment, and share.\nsending you some hearts. The live stream\nwas immediately met with a flood of\nlikes. Let's go teach Lin Sha a lesson.\nLet this arrogant fool learn a lesson.\nSeeing this scene, Ziao Datong was\nfilled with heroic spirit and roared to\nthe sky. Lyn Shao, come out and face\nyour death. He was met with a swift and\naccurate reign of arrows. Whoosh! Ding!\nYou have lost one harpy. Ding! You have\nlost one hog rider. Your loss. Before\nXiao Datang could react, the first wave\nof arrows swept over, and seven or eight\nof his soldiers had already fallen to\nthe ground. Each of them had been\npierced through the heart by two or\nthree arrows at the same time. Damn it.\nEnemy attack. Charge. Ziao Daong roared,\nhis fighting spirit ignited, and he\nactivated his Lord Talent, leading his\ntroops in a charge. The enemy is right\nabove Hulu Pass. We can take them out if\nwe charge up. Whoosh! Another neat\nvolley of arrows rained down and seven\nor eight soldiers were killed on the\nspot. Charge with me. Whoosh. Charge.\nWhoosh. Charge and retreat. Whoosh.\nGrasp. Whoosh. Ding. Player. Xiao. Daong\nin the newbie zone number 89757\nhas been eliminated. H. Everyone in the\nlive stream gasped in shock. The\ngiftgiving suddenly stopped. Tu Shawn by\nChien who were tied up but still managed\nto sneak into the live stream to watch\nexchanged a horrified glance had\ntormented both families to the point of\ndeath was easily killed on the spot by\nLyn Shia with just a few volleys of\narrows. They didn't even get to see Lin\nShia and the phantom archer. Is Lyn Sha\nreally that terrifying? Is this the true\nstrength of the number one genius in\nDaang Dong? At this moment, the live\nstream room was so quiet you could hear\na pin drop. Gene Dang shouted and the\nlast 40 skeleton soldiers immediately\nsurrounded him. He dared not move. The\nrain of arrows stopped. On a distant\nhillside, a tall, handsome man in dark\narmor with a radiant presence slowly\ndescended the hillside, accompanied by\n10 elven archers dressed in green and\nwielding long bows and 10 strange\nsoldiers clad in heavy armor and\ncarrying giant crossbows. It's Lyn Sha.\nLyn Shao slowly walked past the corpses\nscattered on the ground. He didn't even\nstop when he passed Xiao Datang, who was\ncovered in arrows and died with his eyes\nwide open in disbelief. It was as if a\nstray dog had just passed by. He led his\ntroops, hands behind his back,\nexpression calm, and slowly walked to a\nspot not far in front of Gene Duchang.\nHe walked right in front of the live\nbroadcast room. At that moment, he\nappeared like a god descending to earth\nin the live stream. Chapter 49. A\npowerful figure appears in Lanon\ndistrict. The Gene family patriarch\nappears. Don't come any closer. Gene\nDang even forgot to turn off the live\nstream and just shouted in terror. You\nmonster. You actually killed Xiao\nDatang. Aren't you afraid of punishment?\nWhat is the punishment for invading my\nterritory and lawfully killing someone?\nLyn Shao stopped and said loudly, he who\nkills will be killed by others. Gene\nDong, you and Xiao Dang killed so many\nlords in the chaos. Now you can taste\nthe bitterness of death. No need to\nthank me. You're talking nonsense. I\ndidn't kill anyone. Lyn Shia didn't say\nanything, but directly threw several\nscreenshots from his god-like\nperspective into the live stream. Those\nwere photos of lords who had been\nbrutally murdered and the remains of\ntheir territories. Strangely, the lord's\nmansions were not occupied, but\neverything else was destroyed. Monsters\naren't that smart. They wouldn't leave\nthe lord's manor untouched. Without a\ndoubt, what he told the beautiful girl\nearlier was the truth. There was a wound\non a corpse that was even the same as\nthe one on the Malay sword in Gene\nDashangs hand. Xiao Datang and Gene Dang\ndid indeed commit the heinous act of\nambushing and massacring their own\nclansmen without any reason. Tu Shawn by\nChiian, who were secretly watching the\nlive broadcast, immediately burst into\ntears, feeling that their wrongful\nconvictions had been overturned. But\nthey dared not utter a single word\nbecause Lyn Sha had said before he left\nthat if they uttered even one more word,\nhe would kill them to silence them.\nHaving witnessed Lin Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s\nterrifying strength, the two dared not\ndisobey him in the slightest. Upon\nseeing Liao&lt;unk&gt;s picture, Gene Deng\nbroke out in a cold sweat. You have no\nright to judge me. I'm not here to judge\nyou. I'm here to kill you. Lyn Shiao\nsaid coldly, leading his troops forward.\nThis This charge. Phantom archers can't\nhandle skeleton soldiers. Ziao Daong\npushed all the skeleton soldiers out at\nonce. He then turned and fled. Whoosh!\nSplash! A volley of arrows swept across\nthe battlefield, striking the powerful\nskeletons one by one. Unable to\nwithstand the impact, they disintegrated\ninstantly. 40 rare units were instantly\nreduced to ashes. How is this possible?\nThe viewers in the live stream were\nshocked once again. Aren't skeletons\nimmune to arrows? It's those weird\nunits. They're the ones who fired,\nsomeone in the live stream replied. I\nsaw 10 soldiers clad in armor like iron\ntowers with only their eyes showing\nwielding giant crossbows who pierced\nthrough several skeletons with a single\narrow. What kind of unit is this? So\nfierce. Wouldn't that be even more\npowerful than the phantom archer? Lyn\nShia truly deserves to be called the\nnumber one genius in Jangdong. He really\ndid have a trump card up his sleeve. Lyn\nShia is awesome. No, don't kill me.\nDon't kill me. Seeing the skeleton\nsoldiers being easily crushed, Gene\nDuchang could no longer hold on and\nsuffered a mental breakdown. I still\nhave a teleportation talisman. I'll run\nback to my territory. You can't kill me.\nTried to open a portal using a\nteleportation talisman, but his hand\ntrembled and the portal opened in the\ndistance. He cried and crawled toward\nthe portal, screaming all the way, \"Do\nyou think I'll let you off the hook?\"\nLyn Sha sneered and led his troops step\nby step slowly and deliberately to catch\nup with Gene Dang. Hey Lyn Sha, stop\nnow. Dinglay spoke up in the live\nbroadcast room. Leave a way out for\nothers so you can meet again in the\nfuture. You have already killed Xiao\nDaong who accidentally trespassed into\nyour territory. Why go to such lengths\nto exterminate him and relentlessly\npursue Gene Dang as well? You'll be in\nbig trouble if you anger Dong Dang\nAcademy. To be fair, Gene Dang must not\nmake things difficult for Lin Sha in the\nfuture. Lyn Shia will give Gene Dang\n2,000 gold coins as compensation for\nGene Dashangs troop losses and then\nwe'll call it even. How about that?\nDingle&lt;unk&gt;'s prudent and fair words\nalso brought a glimmer of hope to Gene\nDang. With tears streaming down his\nface, he retreated towards the portal,\nhis voice trembling with sobs as he\nloudly echoed, \"Yes, let me go. I'll\nforgive and forget. Otherwise, I can't\nguarantee your personal safety. I have\npowerful connections. Dingle Lynn Sha\nwere equals both geniuses. This time,\nplease do me a favor and also give\nyourself a way out. I'm doing this for\nyour own good, idiot. You think you're\nworthy of being mentioned in the same\nbreath as me? Lyn Sha interrupted\ndirectly. How come I've never heard of\nthis before? Then Lynn Sha turned his\nhead and looked coldly at Gene Dashang\nagain. Terrified, Gene Dang cried and\ncrawled into the teleportation portal.\nLyn Sha led 20 soldiers and stepped\ninside. The live stream switched\ninstantly taking place in Gene Dashangs\nterritory. \"Stop him!\" Gene Dang shouted\nand scrambled toward the Lord's mansion\nlike a madman. From his territory,\nanother squad of wild boar riders\ncharged out. It turns out that Gene Dang\nhad been holding back all along. But how\ncould such a rare unit be a match for\nLin Sha and his group? In less than 3\nseconds, all the boar riders were dead.\nGene Dang bought himself some time and\nran into the Lord's mansion. Lyn Sha\nunhurried and with an imposing gate led\nhis troops slowly into Gene Dashangs\nLord's mansion. Gene Dang wailed. Lyn\nSha, you've invaded my territory. You've\nbroken the rules. You will be punished.\nIdiot. I know the battlefield laws of\n10,000 races better than you do. Lyn Sha\nsaid disdainfully. If one side uses a\npunitive talisman against the other,\neither side may continue fighting until\nthe very end, unless both sides agree to\na ceasefire. Killing you is permitted by\nthe rules. Lyn Sha walked slowly\nforward, getting closer and closer to\nthe isolated and helpless Gene Duchang.\nWhat do you want from me to let him go?\nA deep voice rang out from inside the\nLord's Manor. Everyone in the live\nstream was suddenly startled. It turned\nout that Gene Dang had made a call to\nsomeone and that person then requested\nthat the call be made public so that he\ncould speak directly with Lin Sha. Gene\nDashangs backer has arrived. Gene Dangs\ncommunication interface appeared in the\nlive broadcast room and a figure with\nhis face covered only his eyes showing\nappeared on one side. His ID has been\ndisabled and is not being displayed.\nAlthough his face was not visible, his\narrogant demeanor and aura reminded\neveryone that he was a ruthless and\nskilled person. Everyone in the live\nstream quieted down, waiting for the\nnext scene. I advise you to stop now\nlest you get yourself into trouble, the\nmasked man said. Who are you? Lyn Sha\nasked. Me? Huh? I'm someone you can't\nafford to mess with. Lynn Sha turned his\nhead, and the archer behind him raised\nhis hand and fired an arrow which\npierced through Gene Dashangs right arm.\nGene Dang immediately let out a pig-like\nscream. You talk too much nonsense. You\nI am a top 100 expert lord in the Lan\nregion. How dare you do this to my face?\nLyn Sha turned his head again and two\narchers behind him fired two arrows,\npiercing Gene Dangs legs. You stop. The\nmasked man shouted angrily. You dare\nmess with our international bilingual\nschool. Don't force me to break out of\nmy current server and wipe you out in\nthe newbie zone. Wrong answer. Lyn Shia\npouted regretfully and the two archers\nraised their crossbows again and fired\ntwo arrows. Swish. Swish. Bang. The\nsound of crystal shattering rang out. As\nexpected, Gene Duchang was not shot\nthrough the heart. The crossbow bolts\nwere deflected. Immediately a low\nguttural laugh rang out and a blood red\nshadow slowly rose from Gene Dang who\nhad already fainted from fright. He this\njunior has some skill. He actually\nmanaged to break the protective charm of\na collateral descendant like me. Tens of\nthousands of people in the live stream\ngasped again. The air seemed to freeze\nfor a moment. The way that blood red\nfigure appeared was so shocking. This is\nthe standard way a demon makes his\nentrance. On the other end, the masked\nman, who claimed to be among the top 100\nin the Lnon region, also showed an\nexpression of reverence as he watched\nthe blood red figure slowly rise. The\nphantom archers and the divine arm\narchers immediately went on high alert\nand surrounded Lin Shiao. Chufinga's\nwords echoed in Lin Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s ears. Xin\nDang and his companion have powerful\nbackers. The forces behind them are\ncomplex and intertwined with some even\nconnected to the Jang Bay city lord's\nmansion and the official district.\nLynho&lt;unk&gt;s expression was stern. Xene\nDang and the other man were tyrants who\nhad committed numerous bloody crimes in\nthe Long Kingdom and were now locked in\na life ordeath struggle with him on the\nbattlefield of the myriad races. Lynn\nShiao had already anticipated the worst\ncase scenario when a self-proclaimed top\n100 expert from the official server\nappeared, so he wasn't panicked. Now,\nanother powerful looking blood shadow\nancestor had appeared. How should this\nmatter be resolved? Lyn Xiao's brain\nraced, and finally he gritted his teeth.\nThroughout Chinese history, those who\nachieve great things have always\npossessed ruthlessness. If you back down\nnow, there will be no future. Upon\nseeing that the crimson figure had\ncompletely solidified, the masked man\nrespectfully shouted. Ancestor, \"Holy\ncrap!\" The crimson shadow twitched. \"You\nscared the hell out of me, masked man.\nLive stream room Lyn Sha.\" The blood red\nfigure glanced at the masked man on the\ncommunication interface behind him,\nseemingly not recognizing him, shook his\nhead, then looked around and saw the\nunconscious Gene Dashang. What an\nincompetent descendant. weak and\nuseless. Don't I know my own talisman?\nDid I give him too much? As for you,\nbrat, who intends to kill my descendant,\nyour strength is quite impressive. And\nthe phantom archer is also helping out.\nNot bad. Very good. Even in the early\nstages, you're considered one of the\nstrongest units. You have great\npotential. The crimson figure looked\naround as if no one else was there. Then\nsuddenly, its eyes lit up. Your unit is\nquite interesting. What's it called? In\nthe live stream, tens of thousands of\npeople held their breath, waiting for\nLyn Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s answer. This is an\nupgraded version of the Phantom Shooter.\nLyn Shiao glanced at Song Ruer and his\ngroup, who were as large as two Phantom\narchers, and slowly said, \"Rolls-Royce\nGhost Shooter, short for Gusta Archer.\"\nBeneath the heavy armor mask, Son\nRuer&lt;unk&gt;'s lips twitched involuntarily.\nHow was it upgraded? The blood red\nfigure seemed to have a strong desire to\nlearn and explore. Simple. Just have the\nphantom archer practice singing and\narchery while wearing overalls for 2 and\n1/2 years, Lynsha replied. Practicing\nwhile wearing overalls. Such a bizarre\nway of leveling up is something I've\nnever heard of before. The crimson\nfigure muttered to itself. If I weren't\nbound to this other world and unable to\nunleash my power, I would love to return\nto the blue star realm right now and\ngive it a try. Lyn Sha said calmly. You\ncan't use your power. The crimson figure\nnodded. Exactly. Alas, we won't be able\nto return to the blue star realm anytime\nsoon. With a whoosh, a crossbow bolt\nstruck Gene Dang squarely in the heart.\nDing. Player Gene Dang from the newbie\nzone number 89757\nhas been eliminated. Ding. The live\nstream has been closed due to the\nhomeowner's death. Chapter 50. Gusto's\nrise to fame. What are you talking about\nif you can't even use your power? You\nold showoff. With Gene Duchang's sudden\ndeath, the masked man communicating with\nhim was forced to stop the\ncommunication. The live broadcast room\nwas shut down and the blood red demonic\nshadow vanished in an instant. Lyn Sha\ncurled his lip and led the archers out\nof Gene Duchangs Lord's mansion. It\nwasn't that he was inherently reckless,\nbut rather that as a top student, he\nclearly understood using a conquest\ntalisman against someone is like\nentering a life or death arena. There's\na possibility of being killed in return.\nThis is very common on the battlefield\nof all races, and there's no moral risk\ninvolved. Most lords will simply think\nit's a good thing they killed them. The\npunitive talisman has been issued right\nabove our heads. How can we maintain our\nposition among the lords if we don't\nfight back? Another point is that those\nwho can leave the blue star realm to\nfight in other realms are all\nprehistoric giants. But returning to the\nblue star realm is extremely\ntroublesome. Moreover, he noticed that\nthe Gene family patriarch seemed a bit\ndim-witted. If you don't cut the weeds\nat the root, they'll grow back in the\nspring. Anyone who dares to lay a hand\non me must be punished. With tens of\nthousands of people watching this time,\nI reckon there will be far fewer\nclueless guys messing with me in the\nnewbie zone. Now comes the harvest time.\nBreak through their warehouse. Yes.\nArcher immediately drew his bow and used\nthe five elements arrow to blast Gene\nDashangs warehouse with a fire arrow.\nDing. You have breached Gene Dangs\nwarehouse, obtaining 3,451\nunits of wood. 3,685\nunits of stone, 1558 units of iron ore,\nor 1,774\nunits of copper or 130 units of gold or\n15,478\ngold coins and 568 units of wild beef.\nYou have quite a lot of gold coins. Did\nyou get them from the live stream tips\njust now? Huh? This kid doesn't farm at\nall. He relies entirely on hunting and\nrobbing in the wild. and he's got quite\na lot of resources. Robbing one's own\nkind is indeed a good way to get rich.\nLynn Shiao gave another order. Song\nRuer, use eagle-eyed skill to find any\nempty territories nearby. Xiao Datongs\nmight be among them. These two are in\ncahoots and inseparable. I suspect their\nterritories are adjacent to each other.\nYes, my lord. Over here, Lynn Sha shot\nand killed Gene Dang with an arrow. The\nlive broadcast room was shut down and\ntens of thousands of people were\ncompletely dumbfounded. Immediately, the\ncrowd with nowhere to go flooded into\nthe chat channel, causing it to explode\ninstantly. My god, did you see that? Lyn\nSha killed Xiao Datong and Gene Dang. He\nslaughtered them with ease, like killing\na dog. Is this something a lord with\nonly frank talent can do? Or is Lin Sha\na hidden master? Lyn Sha is so handsome.\nAdd me as a friend. I'll warm your bed.\nHey, upstairs. Stop thinking about it.\nLyn Shia has a pretty girl who's already\nmoved in with him. You're too late. O, I\nwouldn't mind warming the bed with a\npretty girl. That's right. That's right.\nBoss Lyn Sha even has a beautiful\nheroine certified by the God system. He\ndoesn't mind. You bunch of infatuated\ngirls. All you can see is looks. Can't\nyou see the important thing? Why is Lynn\nSha so powerful? Wasn't he seriously\ninjured and searching the world for life\nrestoring potions? Yeah, he didn't look\ninjured at all. Didn't boss Ding Lay\nanalyze that Lin Sha was already\ninjured? Dinglay, the big boss. The chat\nchannel was very active, but Ding Lay\nremained silent. Hey, what's the deal\nwith Lin Sha, you guys? At first, you\nsaid he was a genius from Jangdong\nnumber three middle school and the top\nscorer in the Daangdong provincial\nunified examination. later. You said he\nwas a good for nothing with only F-\nlevel lord talent and could only be a\nwandering lord, but everyone just saw\nit. He has two squads of soldiers, each\nmore powerful than the last. Exceptional\nphantom archers and an upgraded version\nof the phantom archers, something\nancient. Gust the archer. This name\nsounds a bit strange, but it's really\npowerful. One arrow can kill several\nrare skeleton warriors. Has anyone seen\nthis type of soldier before? No. Didn't\nGene Deshangs ancestor also never see\nhim? He was quite a formidable figure.\nThe chat channel was quiet for a while.\nThen the conversation turned to the\nblood red figure and the atmosphere\nsuddenly became a little awkward.\nEveryone knows how the live stream was\neventually shut down. Lynn Shia seems to\ncompletely disregard this ancestor of\nthe Gene family. Gene Dang, the nth\ngeneration leader, died in vain. And\nthat masked guy in the official server\nclaiming to be a top 100 expert lord.\nLyn Sha didn't give him any face at all.\nHe directly killed Gene Dang. Cool.\nFearless of power. Boss Lyn Sha is\nawesome. Some people admired Lyn Sha.\nHuh? An answer my foot. Some expert lord\neven came from another region to cause\nhim trouble. Lyn Sha is probably in deep\ntrouble this time. Master Lord. That's a\ntitle for someone ranked in the top 100\nin the official server. To be ranked in\nthe top 100 in an official server with\ntens of millions of players, that's the\nultimate master. Lyn Sha is doomed. With\nsuch a high ranking, it'll be difficult\nfor him to even leave the live server.\nHave he abandoned his foundation?\nStupid. A big shot like that has\ncountless underlings. Just send his\nunderlings. The two sides started\narguing. One side admired Lyn Sha,\nmarveling at how someone with an F-level\ntalent could achieve such success and\nhad begun calling him big boss. The\nother side still looked down on Lyn Sha,\nbelieving he was too bloodthirsty and\nwould soon be killed by experts from the\nofficial region. Suddenly, a\nnotification from the main god system\ncame through. Ding. Dinglay, a player\nfrom the L nan region of the blue star\nrealm, has successfully recruited the\nfirst hero, becoming the ninth rookie\nlord in the L nan region this year.\nSystem reward, one excellent treasure\nchest. It's Dinglay, so he's trying to\nclimb the charts. In the battlefield of\nthe myriad races, there are various\nrankings. The regular ones include the\nfirst hero recruited, the second hero\nrecruited, and the first hero to reach\nlevel three. The special ones include\nthe tasks that are released at a regular\nintervals in the battlefield of the\nmyriad races. Therefore, people\ngenerally refer to the act of recruiting\nheroes as rushing to the rankings.\nDinglay everyone. I'm unworthy to be the\nsecond person in our newbie zone to\nrecruit heroes. But this time, the chat\nchannel wasn't as full of compliments as\nI'd expected. Dinglay is awesome.\nDinglay is still as stable as ever.\nThere were very few people who came to\noffer their congratulations. A hint of\ndisappointment flashed through Ding Lays\nmind. And he said again, \"Everyone, to\nbe fair, even though I'm only ninth in\nall the newbie zones in the Lan region,\nas you all know, this is extremely\ndifficult. It's impossible for anyone in\nour region to be the first to recruit.\nToday, Ding Chufinga, a player from the\nLong Nan region of the Blue Star Realm,\nhas successfully recruited the first\nhero, becoming the 10th New Lord in the\nLan region this year. System reward, one\nexcellent treasure chest. Everyone, huh?\nMeanwhile, in the open space of Lin\nXiao's Lord's Manor, Hay and Tu Shan by\nChien, who were bound hand and foot,\nwere laughing so hard they were almost\nout of breath. The two dared not speak\nin the live stream or chat channel, but\nthey were not prohibited from chatting\nverbally. Dinglay was really too\npretentious. Didn't he get slapped in\nthe face in a flash? I've disliked him\nfor a long time. He's a pretentious\nshowoff who always likes to say things\nlike, \"Let me speak the truth.\" But he's\nnot fair at all. He's just pulling one\nside down while putting the other down.\nHarah, it's all thanks to my boss, Lyn\nSha, who saw through his true colors\nlong ago and slapped him in the face\nseveral times. He said with a laugh.\nWhat? Your boss, Lyn Shao? When did Lin\nSha become your boss? Tu Shan by Chian\nrolled her eyes and said sourly, \"You\nforgot. I He confronted Xiao Dong and\nstood up for boss Lin Shiao in front of\neveryone three times.\" \"Boss Lin Shiao\ndefinitely remembers me.\" Oh, but didn't\nyou chickenen out right away? You've\nbecome a laughingstock. You Lyn Sha is\ndefinitely mine. I'm quite pretty, and\nI've already expressed my feelings to\nhim. He's bound to fall for me. The\nflower fairies nearby protested,\nchattering. The fairies are even more\nbeautiful. Lord, you'll definitely love\nthe fairies. He's a Whose lord are you\ntalking about? Me or Lyn Sha? Quiet. The\nphantom archer who stayed behind finally\ncouldn't help but shout, \"Behave\nyourselves.\" Once everyone quieted down,\nthe phantom archer muttered something\nelse. \"A bunch of vulgar beauties. How\ncould the Lord possibly take a liking to\nyou? You two shan by Chin immediately\nexploded. Even the rope binding her\ncouldn't stop her chest from heaving.\nHer face puffed up, making her look\nincredibly cute. My beauty is already\none in a million. How many people in\nthis world are more beautiful than me?\nThe flower fairies chattered amongst\nthemselves. The fairies are the most\nbeautiful. Without the angels, no one\ncan compare to their beauty. Quiet. The\nphantom archer once again stopped\neveryone, rolled his eyes, and didn't\nbother to answer. Just then, a commotion\narose at the territory gate. The Lord\nhas returned. Lyn Sha returned in a\ngreat hurry, leading a large group of\nsoldiers. One of the men, a burly man\nclad in heavy armor, had an unconscious\nfigure on his shoulder. Chapter 51. All\nof you better shut up gracefully. He and\nTu Shan by Chian immediately shut up and\nlooked at the group of people who came\nin. Lyn Sha glanced at the two of them\nindifferently, then walked straight into\nthe Lord&lt;unk&gt;'s mansion. Those who\nreturned with Lynn Shiao included the\nPhantom Archers, the Gust Archers,\ndressed like tin cans, and a squad of\nburly soldiers wearing thick shiny armor\nresembling fish scales and wielding\nmassive 3 m long weapons. The captain of\nthe leading unit put the unconscious\nfigure he was carrying on his shoulder\ndown to the ground, then stood aside\nwithout saying a word, holding his\nweapon. The unconscious figure was a\nyoung man who appeared to be a lord in\nthe newbie zone. However, he was\nseriously injured at the moment with\nseveral hideous wounds on his body.\nAlthough they had been simply bandaged,\nblood was still slowly seeping out. He\nand Tu Shan by Chin were unsure of Lin\nXiao&lt;unk&gt;s intentions, so they simply\nsat quietly on the ground, awaiting\ntheir fate. At this moment, the flower\nfairy beside her whispered a few words.\nMy lord, look. This person is emitting a\ngreen glow. Heay turned his head to look\nand saw specks of green mist slowly\nseeping into the unconscious man's body.\nHe frowned and then relaxed as if he had\nthought of something. Lyn Sha entered\nthe lord's mansion and saw the\nstunningly beautiful enchantress Baoi\nsitting on a long bench with a frown.\nUpon seeing Lyn Sha return, Ba quickly\nrose and bowed. My lord, you're back. No\nneed for formalities, Baoi. Lyn Shao\nreached out and helped Baoi up, secretly\nmarveling at her amazing charm, which\nwas far more captivating than any of the\n24 female creatures outside combined. He\nreached out and handed Ba a dark red\npotion, saying, \"Take this and see if it\ncan relieve your pain.\" Baosi suddenly\nlooked up, her clear and bright eyes\nmeeting Lin Xiao, and said, \"My lord,\nthis this is a secret recipe for the\nsupremacy. I learned about it from a\nfriend. Give it a try.\" Ba's heart\nfluttered. The Lord had actually worried\nabout her such a small matter. Seeking\nmedicine and medical help. In an\ninstant, her pain seemed to ease\nconsiderably. She immediately thanked\nLin Sha and took the medicine. The pain\nsubsided immediately after the medicine\nentered her throat. Seeing Lin Xiao's\nconcerned gaze, Baoi was even more\nmoved. Reporting to my lord, I am much\nbetter and can no longer feel the pain.\nI am ashamed. My lord, you must have\ngone to great lengths for my lowly body.\nDing. You have resolved Ba's health\nissues. Ba sees two elements reversal.\nLuck value has now increased to minus\n85. Hearing the voice of the main god\nsystem, Lynsha was somewhat taken aback.\nThis had increased his luck again. Lyn\nShiao had previously tried to purchase a\nlife-healing potion but failed. Ziao\nDaong even tried to humiliate him by\nusing it. After Lin Sha killed Ziao\nDaong and Gene Dang, demonstrating\nundeniable power, several people\nimmediately contacted him, offering to\nsend him life healing potions. Lynn\nShiao didn't stand on ceremony. He\nrefused the freebies and bought five\ntubes directly at the market price of\n100 gold coins each. The ordinary spirit\nfield, fine breastplate, fine leg armor,\nattack claw, and birch longbow that he\nhad listed on the auction house were all\nsold immediately. However, the black\nlong sword has remained untouched to\nthis day, perhaps because it is too\nsensitive. You don't need to overthink\nit. Lynsha said, \"This life healing\npotion is a common potion. It didn't\ntake me much effort to obtain it. Bae,\nthis battlefield of myriad races is full\nof wonders, and anything is possible.\nOnce you come here, you can forget your\npast experiences and live a happy and\nfulfilling life. Whether she was a\nconcubine or not was secondary. What he\nstill couldn't figure out was whether\nthe muffled groan in his mind was a\nhallucination or something someone had\ndone on purpose. The main thing is that\nif you're happy, your rule level skills\ncan be used to my advantage instead of\nharming me, Lyn Sha thought to himself.\nBesides, I can only make money if you're\nhappy. With tears in her eyes, Baoi\nbowed again, looking charming and\ntouching. Lyn Sha nodded, accepting\nBao's gratitude. If you're feeling\nbetter, tell me more about what happened\nwith the ancient demons. I want to know\nmore details. With that, he pulled Bao\nSei down to sit with him. Yes, my lord.\nBaoi nestled naturally in Linhao&lt;unk&gt;s\narms and began to speak. Outside, he tu\nShan by Chiian and the flower fairies\nfelt extremely uncomfortable under the\nwatchful eyes of the various military\nunits. Apart from the phantom archer,\nwho has a relatively gentle appearance,\nthe other two soldier types are all tall\nand burly, covered in iron armor,\nexuding a murderous aura. Seeing that\nLin Shao had returned, the two dared not\nsay anything more. They were in the\nwrong, both morally and logically. They\nhad invaded Lin Xiao's territory.\nHereafter clarified, the place where a\nlord resides is called the Lord's\nmansion. The area inside the Lord's\nmansion and a host of functional\nbuildings plus defensive measures such\nas walls constitutes the territory. The\nmines occupied by the lord outside as\nwell as a certain radius outside the\nterritory also belong to the lord and\nare called territory. Furthermore, Tu\nShawn by Chin's brainless leak of Lin\nXiao&lt;unk&gt;s troop information nearly\ncaused a major disaster. If it were a\nmore ruthless lord, it would be normal\nfor them to be killed outright. So, the\ntwo of them could only stare at the\nunconscious man on the ground with\nnothing else to do. Just then, footsteps\nsounded and another figure arrived at\nthe Lord's Mansion Square. The man's\nrobes appeared somewhat disheveled,\nstained with blood. A pale blue, long,\nsingle-edged sword was tucked into his\nwaistband, and a stench of blood\nemanated from the sword. Upon closer\ninspection, however, they saw that the\nman was wearing a light blue robe that\nneither of them had seen before, but\nwhich they subconsciously found very\nattractive and endearing. He had a\ntiger-striped gold belt around his\nwaist, and his long hair was neatly tied\nback. Below his eyebrows were bright\neyes, and he had a slender figure. He\nwas not old, but he looked dashing and\nhandsome. The flower fairies could even\nutter their wow. He turned around and\nglared at them fiercely, causing them to\nshut their mouths. The group of men and\nwomen in the square. Mr. Payman. Upon\nseeing this man, the soldiers all bowed\nin greeting. Just as he and Tu Shan by\nChan were pondering, the unconscious man\non the ground slowly woke up. He first\nquickly sat up, checked his injuries,\nand found that he was basically\nunharmed. Then he looked around and saw\na crowd of people watching him. After a\nfew seconds of silence, the man looked\nat Pay Min. Are you the Lord? Pay Min\nshook his head. The man looked at Song\nRu and Tangg Yi, both of whom remained\nsilent. The man looked at Hay and Tu Sha\nby Chen again. He wanted to ask them a\nquestion, but when he saw the two of\nthem tied up, he curled his lip and\nturned back. Hey, what's with that look\nyou're giving me? He immediately\nprotested. Why don't you ask me if I'm\nthe Lord? Too weak? The man replied\nwithout turning his head. What about me?\nWhy didn't you ask me? You're a pretty\ngirl, but you're too stupid. You tu Shan\nby Chian was angered again. You then he\nchanged his tone. I'll accept it if you\ncall me stupid as long as I'm the most\nbeautiful. Both the man and Heay\ncouldn't help but slightly purse their\nlips. Seeing that the flower fairies\nwere about to start arguing again. The\nphantom archer who was guarding the side\nimmediately understood what was about to\nhappen. Quiet. The phantom archer\nshouted, then reported. Captain Saul,\nthe women here, as prisoners have no\nself-awareness and always like to argue\nabout who is the most beautiful. Upon\nhearing the archer's report, Soldering\nalso came over. In any case, as elves,\nwe should not treat ladies in such an\ninelegant manner. Ladies over here,\nplease stop talking about such pointless\ntopics. Yes, there's no need to discuss\nit at all because my little sister is\nthe most beautiful. Tan by Chin raised\nher chin and said proudly. The flower\nfairies retorted again, \"No way, you\nbig- breasted, brainless woman. The\nfairies are the most beautiful\nsoldering. All of you shut your clever\nmouths up gracefully. With a creek, the\ngate of the Lord&lt;unk&gt;'s mansion opened\nand two people walked out. The flower\nfairies and two Shan by Chin snorted\ncoldly and turned to look. Upon seeing\nthis, everyone's mouths immediately\ngaped open. Chapter 52. This kid is\nruthless. The people who came out were\nLin Sha and Ba. Lyn Sha was tall and\nhandsome with a calm and composed\ndemeanor. His dark armor gave him an air\nof mystery that inspired a desire to\nfollow him. But Tu Shan by Chian Heay\nand all the flower fairies were focused\non another person. It was a woman\nwearing a dark red cloak. She had\nalready lowered the hood, revealing a\nface of unparalleled beauty. She was\nboth pure and ethereal, yet alluring and\nseductive, possessing a charm that\nblended innocence and allure. Her hair\nwas as black as a waterfall, and her\nface was as white as if it were carved\nfrom ice crystals without any flaws.\nEven though she was wearing a cloak,\npeople could still feel the figure\nsealed beneath it, which aroused endless\nimagination. The feeling she gave people\nmade their hearts pound as if they had\nseen the white moonlight in their\nhearts. This This is Lin Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s\nbeautiful heroine. Heay murmured. Wow,\nshe's absolutely gorgeous little sister.\nCompared to her, I'm really just\nslightly better looking. Tu Shan by Chin\ncouldn't help but ask, \"Can I add you as\na friend, sister?\" \"Wow, even angels\naren't this beautiful.\" Yao Yao has seen\na woman even more beautiful than an\nangel today. The flower fairies\nchattered excitedly, their eyes shining.\nEven the man who had remained silent\nafter the questioning stared intently at\nBa. After a few seconds, he finally\nreacted, lowering his head deeply as if\nhe dared not look directly at her. The\nphantom archer standing guard nearby\ncurled his lips slightly, revealing his\ninner thoughts. Upon seeing the two\nemerge, all the soldiers in front of the\nlord's manner bowed in unison. Lord,\nMiss Ba Soldering smiled at Tu Shawn by\nChin and the flower demon. Ladies, now\nyou know why your arguments are\npointless, don't you? Lynn Sha waved his\nhand, signaling everyone to be quiet.\nThen he walked to the front and looked\nindifferently at the crowd who were\nstill bound hand and foot. Hey pretty\ngirl, what's your name? Tan. Tan by\nChian. The beautiful girl still looked\nat Bao Si with her eyes filled with both\nadmiration and a hint of jealousy. She\ndidn't understand why she felt this way.\nVery good. Lynn Shiao turned to the\nmysterious man. What's your name? The\nmysterious man's wounds had healed\nconsiderably and his spirits had\nreturned to normal. He said in a low\nvoice, \"Chan Ningming.\" Lin Sha nodded,\nthen turned to look at Heay and Tu Sha\nby Chian. He tu Shan by Chiian, you two\nhave trespassed into my territory and\nleaked information to Xiao Datang. Do\nyou know what punishment you will\nreceive? Heay was taken aback and said,\n\"Boss Lin Shiao, it was Zay May who\nleaked the information. I was trying to\nstop her. You invaded with 23 flower\nfairies while the beautiful girl came\nempty-handed. You are quite a threat.\"\nHeay was on the verge of tears. Brother\nLin Shiao. That's because Zay May wasn't\ncapable enough. Her troops were all\nkilled by Xiao Datang and the others. I\nhad 100 flower fairies protecting me as\nI escaped. And this is all that's left.\n100 flower fairies. One recruitment\ntoken gives you 10 flower fairies. So\nHeay didn't bring anything with him into\nexcept for 100 flower fairies. Lyn Sha\nglanced at heay's thick dark circles and\nthought to himself that this kid was\njust like a time management master. He\ncould handle 100 flower fairies. He\nwouldn't even need makeup to play the\nempty prince. Tu Shan by Chin said,\n\"Brother Lin Sha, we didn't do it on\npurpose. I was attacked by Xiao Datong\nbefore my guard captain died. He told me\nto run north. On my way to escape, I met\nHeay who was also attacked. So we\nescaped here. Little sister didn't\ninvade. Please don't punish Little\nSister. Punishment. Yao Yao wants\npunishment. The flower fairy whispered.\nSoldering immediately glared at them and\nthe flower fairies shut their mouths.\nLyn Shiao shook his head and looked at\nChun Ningming. What about you? Tell me\nabout your experience. Chun Ningming was\na thin and gloomy man among the lords\nwho entered the battlefield of 10,000\nraces. He was considered young. His\nfacial features were very deep, but his\nbrows looked very gloomy. Am I a\nprisoner, too? You are not. But I saved\nyou, so I need to get to know you.\nShuning Ming, a new lord, level five\nlord talent is graceful liberation, had\ntwo squads of ordinary militia and one\nsquad of peasants, all of whom were\nkilled in action. My territory was\nbreached by monsters, and it turned out\nthat it was another new lord in\ndisguise. I was seriously injured and\nalmost died when the god system\nannounced the death of another lord. The\nlord who attacked me thought I was dead.\nSo he went to plunder my resources. I\nwaited for them to leave, intending to\nfollow them and expose their true\ncolors. But I fainted on the way and\nended up here. Chun Ningming didn't\nwaste any words, revealing his\nexperiences, current condition, and even\nhis lordly talent, which surprised Lin\nSha and the others. This person was one\nof the nearby lords he saw when he\nopened his divine perspective. He was\nalready unconscious at the time, but his\nlimbs were still crawling involuntarily.\nWhen Lyn Sha saw that this person had\nsuch a tenacious will to live, he felt\ncompassion and helped him up. Whether he\nlived or died was up to fate. You were\nattacked and are on your last breath.\nYet you still want to track them down.\nLynch asked, \"Yes, we must avenge every\nwrong. Even if I die, I will drag them\ndown with me. He's ruthless. Everyone\nthought this was the unanimous\nassessment. You don't need to fight\nanymore. The lords who attacked were\nXiao Datang and Gene Dang, and they have\nalready been killed by our boss, Lin\nShiao,\" he said with a touch of emotion.\n\"All right, I'll remember this favor.\"\nAfter saying that, Shan Ningming shut\nhis mouth and sat on the ground without\nmoving with only wisps of green light\nconstantly seeping into his body. Lin\nShiao gave Chun Ningming a deep look,\nthen addressed the crowd in a loud\nvoice. I won't waste any more words. I\nam neither a bloodthirsty person nor a\nweakling. He a Tu Shan by Chiian. Your\nterritory has been breached. Your men\nhave been wiped out. You have mistakenly\ntrespassed on my territory and you have\neven leaked my information. Lyn Sha\nstared at the two of them. I'll give you\ntwo choices. One is to accept the\npunishment and then sign a\nconfidentiality agreement with me in the\ngod system, promising not to reveal a\nsingle word about me here. In the other,\nI'll let you go. These two have already\nmet the archers with divine crossbows,\nthe iron guards with long swords, pay\nmen and ba. This information must not be\nrevealed. Punishment. Punishment. Yao\nYao needs to be punished. The flower\nfairy started chattering again. My dear\nsisters, please stop talking. Heay\nimmediately turned around and shouted to\nstop them. Lyn Sha felt a slight\nheadache and continued. The second\noption is to become my vassel lord and\nsign a 6-month service contract. During\nthis period, you will obey my orders and\nI have the right to use your resources.\nIs it the kind of vassel that the Lord\nhas to give Yao Yao to whenever he\nwants? Stop talking. I am your lord. He\ncontinued to suppress the flower demon.\nI choose the second one, a deep male\nvoice said. Lynn Shiao turned his head\nin surprise. You can leave as long as\nyou don't expose my secret. No, Chining\nMing said, \"You saved me, so I should\nrepay you. Besides, you were able to\nkill Ziao Daang and his men, so you must\nbe very powerful. I want to become your\nvassel lord.\" Lyn Sha nodded and looked\nat Heay and Tu Shan by Chian. Those who\nknow how to eat are heroes. He\nstammered. I admire Lynn Shiao and am\nwilling to follow him, so I choose the\nsecond option. Upon hearing the previous\nsentence, Lyn Sha was slightly taken\naback and nodded. Little sister, I came\nhere to seek refuge with boss Lynn. I\nchose the second option. When can you\nuntie me? Tu Shan by Chin also said,\n\"Okay.\" Lyn Shao gestured for the\nphantom archer to untie everyone. After\neveryone was untied, Lin Shaol looked up\nat the sky and said calmly, \"I'll ask\nyou one last time. You can still back\nout now. If you want to become my vassel\nlords, sign the contract directly.\nThere's nothing to regret.\" The three of\nthem shook their heads, stepped forward,\nand signed their names under the\nstandard contract of the god system.\n\"Very good,\" Lyn Sha smiled. \"Judging by\nthe time, it's about time.\" \"What do you\nmean about the same?\" Eay asked,\nsomewhat curious. At this moment, the\nannouncement from the main god system\nsounded. Ding. Serverwide announcement.\nPlayer Black Flame from the LN region\nhas used a server-breaking talisman to\nlaunch an attack on player Lin Sha from\nthe 89,757\nnewbie zone. The server-breaking event\nwill take place in 10 days. This is it.\nChapter 53. Undercurrents and reactions\nfrom multiple parties. After Lin Sha\nshot and killed Gene Datong with an\narrow in front of tens of thousands of\npeople in the live broadcast room, it\ncaused quite a stir not only in the\n89757 newbie zone, but also in the long\nstable LN zone. Just before the\nannouncement of the district's opening,\ninside a magnificent Gothic mansion, a\nman in a floral shirt leaned quietly\nagainst a large, comfortable sofa, his\nposture relaxed yet exuding the aura of\na superior. Behind him stood a\nstunningly beautiful angel, her wings\npure white, her long golden hair\ncascading down to her waist, radiating\nan aura of holiness. Even though the\nangel stood motionless by her side, the\nradiance she slowly released still\nfilled the entire living room with\nbright light. Opposite the man in the\nfloral shirt, a man dressed in black sat\nrespectfully. He was the masked man who\nhad spoken with Lin Shao earlier. He was\nnot wearing a mask at the moment,\nrevealing a face with a thick beard and\na hooked nose. So that's all you've\nseen? Yes, sir. Although Gene Duchang is\njust an insignificant member of our\ncollateral branch, he still has a\nconnection with the Gene family of Jang\nBay. Lynn Sha in front of tens of\nthousands of people ignored my warnings\nand the Gene family patriarch and shot\nGene Duchang dead. If we don't retaliate\nfor this, people in the underworld will\nlaugh at us. The man in the floral shirt\nchuckled. This newbie has some guts. Not\neven putting you. Who's ranked 100th in\nthe official zone? In his eyes. Sir,\nit's the top 100. The hook-nosed man\nsaid with utmost respect. The man in the\nfloral shirt waved his hand, not wanting\nto dwell on the topic, and after a\nmoment's thought, said, \"You've been\nheavily involved with highranking\nfigures in Japan lately, and that woman\nfrom Lsha domain is keeping a close eye\non you. Here's what we'll do. You\npersonally select someone to handle this\nmatter. Make sure you choose someone\ncapable enough and have them lead enough\ntroops and equipment to completely crush\nthat kid. Let all the newbies in the\nbeginner zone know the consequences of\noffending a pro in the official zone.\nYes, sir. My lord, I have a choice.\nBlack flame. Dealing with that brat is a\nsure thing. But but what? The man in the\nfloral shirt asked, his voice trailing\noff. But the troops under my command\ncan't demonstrate the abilities of our\nnoble faction. Huh? You little rascal. I\nknew you'd make it. So tell me, what\nkind of unit do you want? The man with\nthe hooked nose chuckled and said\nhumbly, \"Sir, that kid has a team of\nphantom archers and a team of enhanced\nphantom archers, the Guggist archers,\nwhich is why he was able to strike first\nand easily defeat Gene Dang and his\ngroup. The Phantom Archers are strongest\nin rapid fire and long range shooting,\nmaking them difficult for most unit\ntypes to deal with. The men I send out\nwith a full complement of units will\ndefinitely win, but there may be losses.\nI would like to borrow two units of epic\ntroops from you, sir. The ace unit of\nthe British Empire, the British Long\nBowman. In this way, Black Flame can\ncrush Lin Shia without taking any\ndamage. This battle will show our might.\nLet everyone know that the dignity of\nour noble lineage cannot be challenged.\nHaving said that, the man with the\nhooked nose looked at the man in the\nfloral shirt with a burning gaze and an\nexcited expression. He unexpectedly the\nman in the floral shirt laughed. Wong\nSu, you're still a bit lacking. The man\nwith the hooked nose paused, then\ncontinued. Don't you guys remember that\nLin Sha was the first hero recruited\nthis year? What reward did the God of\nWar give him? A beautiful heroine, but\nno one has ever seen one. What's so\nspecial about such a pretty face? No\nmatter how beautiful she is, can she\ncompare to the angels under your\ncommand, sir? Madness, the man in the\nfloral shirt shouted, startling the man\nwith the hooked nose, who immediately\nsat up straight. Which year's top player\nin the entire region doesn't receive an\nepic treasure chest as a reward? Didn't\nthis regionwide announcement mention\nthat? Gust Archer. Gust Archer\npracticing archery while wearing\noveralls. You actually believe that\nnonsense? Lynn Shia has only been in the\nbattlefield of 10,000 races for a short\ntime. Yet, he's been training phantom\narchers for 2 and 1/2 years. Do you\nthink 2 and 1/2 years can be passed by\njust singing and dancing? The man with\nthe hooked nose broke out in a cold\nsweat, then suddenly realized something.\nWhat does the master mean? Those\nso-called gust archers are the units\nthat Lynn Sha recruited using epic\nrecruitment tokens obtained from opening\nepic treasure chests. They are epic\nunits. With a loud bang, the hook-nosed\nman felt a jolt in his brain and his\nwhole body stood frozen and swayed. So\nthat's how it is. No wonder those\narchers were so powerful. They were\nactually epic units. I the adult seeing\nthat the man with the hooked nose had\nrealized what was happening. The man in\nthe floral shirt didn't say anything\nmore and continued. Don't get cocky just\nbecause you've made it into the top 100\nand forgotten the most basic rules and\nknowledge. You still have a lot to\nlearn. Upon hearing that he was ranked\n100th on the list, the man with the\nhooked nose seemed to have something to\nsay. But seeing the cold look in the\nman's eyes, he held back and lowered his\nhead. You said you wanted to equip Black\nFlame with the undying Longbow Bowman,\nand I agree. The man in the floral shirt\nsaid, \"I'll lend you two squads of\nundying long bowman. Perfect counters to\nphantom archers so the newbies in the\nbeginner zone can see what the longest\nrange really is. In addition, I will\nlend you a legendary gold unit with the\nhooked nose suddenly looked up, utterly\nastonished. This legendary golden unit\nis rare even for the man before him.\nEven among the top 10 experts in the\nregion, they all treat it like a\ntreasure. yet he's willing to lend it to\nme. In this battle, I'll crush this\narrogant brat before he comes to see me.\nIn the 9527 newbie zone, a stunningly\nbeautiful, aloof, long-haired woman also\nheard the announcement of the\ncondemnation issued throughout the\nentire zone. 10 days. I never sensed\nsuch a murderous aura from him when we\nwere in school. The solitary woman\nmuttered to herself. Lyn Shia is a smart\nman. Even though he knew the\nconsequences, he still did it. So what\nexactly gives him his confidence? The\naloof woman waved her hand and a dashing\nfemale soldier immediately stepped\nforward. Mississippi. Two things. First,\ninvestigate the strength of this black\nflame and is backing. The more detailed,\nthe better. Yes, Mississippi. Second, go\nask Marlinia if the crimson corruption\non her body has been suppressed. If it's\ngone, we can go kill some monsters now.\nThis time, I don't want to come in\nsecond place again. After answering, the\nfemale soldier hesitated and said,\n\"Miss, every minute and every second is\nextremely important. Since you are\naiming for first place in the second\ntier university entrance exam, why help\nthe man who took first place from you in\nthe first tier university entrance\nexam?\" The aloof woman turned her head\nand looked at the female soldier calmly.\nI want to win against him fair and\nsquare. No one but me will do.\nFurthermore, if you ask me this kind of\nquestion again, I'll punish you by\nmaking you stand guard for a month. Yes,\nmiss. The female soldier shrank back,\nnot daring to say anything more. At the\nsame time, the announcement of the\ndistrict's expansion resounded\nthroughout the Lon district. Some people\ngloated, some sighed inwardly, and some\nacted as if nothing had happened,\nkeeping quiet about it. Chu Yusi, the\ncity lord of Jangdong city, seemed quite\nsurprised after hearing the announcement\nfrom the god system. He quickly found\nsomeone and asked them the reason.\nSlowly, Chu Yusi's expression changed\nfrom surprise to confusion and then from\nconfusion to anger. Chufinga, you little\nred-haired monster. Didn't I tell you to\nkeep a close eye on Lyn Shia and help\nhim properly? How could you let him act\nso recklessly and now he's brought\nretaliation upon himself? Wouldn't you\nbe eager to do something that would\nattract so much hatred? Huh? You brat.\nAnswer the phone now. Chapter 54. The\nabilities of Tu Shan by Chian Heay and\nShin Ningming. Back to Lin Xiao's side.\nThe announcement of the server breaking\nwas heard. He's expression slowly\nchanged from questioning to\nastonishment. I feel like I've been\nscammed. No wonder Lin Shia asked the\nthree of them a second time before\nquickly signing the contract. He was\nafraid they would back out. idiot.\nSeeing Heay's expression, Tu Shan by\nChian rolled her eyes. Lin Shiao killed\nXiao Daong and Gene Dang in front of\ntens of thousands of people in the live\nbroadcast room, which slapped the face\nof that top 100 official district lord.\nHe will definitely suffer retaliation.\nRevenge is fine. Xiao Datang and the\nothers are dead, which is perfect for\ndealing with their backers. My sister\njoined Lin Xiao's gang partly out of\nrevenge. He was somewhat surprised.\nYou're not stupid anymore, beautiful\ngirl. Tan by Chin said, \"People are\nnever stupid when it comes to strategy.\"\nOkay, so it also exposed Lin Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s\ntroop strength. I've been wrongly\naccused and I'm so angry. Tu Shan by\nChin said agrievedly. Sigh. It's because\nof you that my luck has run out. He\ncould only shake his head. Now that I'm\nalready on board, I have nothing left to\nlose, so I'll just follow boss Lin\nShiao. Shan Ningming remained silent and\nunresponsive, as if the announcement had\nnothing to do with him. His expression\nremained gloomy, yet he exuded a\nmenacing aura, fearless and undeterred,\nlike someone with nothing to lose. Lynn\nShiao asked curiously, \"What's your\nreason for having a partner?\" \"Beautiful\nlady. My other half,\" he This is it. Tu\nShan by Chian immediately rushed over\nand hugged Baoi, who had been standing\nquietly beside Lin Shao. Huh? Ba didn't\neven have time to react before she was\nsuddenly embraced by a cute little girl\nin a white Lolita dress. Sister smells\nso good. Wow, sister is so wellendowed.\nBefore Tan by Chin could finish\nspeaking, Lyn Sha grabbed her ear and\npulled her away. Unexpectedly, this\nbeautiful girl actually developed\nfeelings for him. But it seems that her\nfeelings weren't directed at him. So,\ndoes this mean I'm going to have to\ncompete with women for women? Lynn Shiao\nshook his head inwardly, dispelling his\nunfounded speculation. Behave yourself,\npretty girl. Tell me what lordly talents\nyou and he a possess. Lyn Sha gave the\norders, and the troops immediately\ndispersed to take up their posts,\nleaving only the lord and the hero\nnearby. Now that you have become my\nvassel lords and pledged your allegiance\nto me, we should share some information\nso that we can work together to deal\nwith the official district lords who\nhave broken into our territory. However,\nyou don't need to worry too much. The\ntarget is me, and they won't kill you.\nIf I die, our contract will be void, and\nyou will be free. But if anyone betrays\nme during my time as my vassal lord,\ntheir fate will be the same as Xiao\nDatangs. Lin Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s face darkened\nand Hay and Tu Shawn by Chian\nimmediately recalled the terror of being\ndominated by Guster Archer in the live\nbroadcast room. Immediately the three of\nthem turned serious. They knew that Lynn\nShia never hesitated to kill. My lord\ntalent is beast transformation to Shan\nby Chin replied a B-level talent which\nallows one to transform into a white fox\ndemon. When transformed into a fox\ndemon, movement speed increases by 100%.\nAlso, due to the special nature of the\ndemon beast, one can pass through\nmonster occupied areas and see through\nthe fog of war without arousing the\nhostility of most wild monsters. \"His\nperfect scout talent is a compliment to\nmy god-like perspective,\" Lin Sha\nthought to himself. \"I just don't know\nif Tu Shan by Chan is smart enough. She\nwas provoked in the live broadcast and\nspilled almost everything. He's a my\nlord talent is flower fairy, a seale\ntalent and also a family inheritance\ntalent. In the battlefield of the myriad\nraces, some families inherit talents,\nsome strong and some weak. Those who\nencounter strong family talents are\ncertainly lucky to be born into a good\nfamily. But those who encounter weak\ntalents can't do anything about it. They\nare born that way and have no choice.\nHe's talent is sea level, so he probably\nisn't very strong. Tan by Chin suddenly\nrealized why the school boy in the\nschool uniform had brought 100 flower\nfairies into the battlefield and why\nthey were all so loyal. I can boost the\nflower fair's combat power and health,\nand I can also develop some of their\nspecial abilities. Heay paused a little\nembarrassedly. Lyn Sha glanced\nindifferently at Heizay&lt;unk&gt;s dark\ncircles under his eyes. He wondered if\nthe special function developed was the\none that caused Heizay's dark circles.\nIt's just that my level is too low, so I\ncan't unlock many functions yet, and the\nbonus to the flower fairy isn't high\nenough. Currently, it only increases the\nflower fairy strength by about 10%,\nwhich is why I got beaten up by Xiao\nDaong and the others. Len Shia nodded,\nthen looked at Chuning Ming. I've never\nheard of your talent name before. Is it\na new talent? Lord talents are unique to\npeople in this world. Every year all\nsorts of new talents appear. So it's not\nsurprising that people are unaware of\nthem. Graceful liberation. This is the\nname of the talent that the main god\nsystem told me after I entered the\nbattlefield. Shuning said, \"When I took\nthe lord's talent test, the test stone\ntablet only flashed with light\nrepresenting a sea level talent. There\nwas no other information.\" After saying\nthat, Shin Ningming directly displayed\nthe description panel of the graceful\nliberation skill for Lin Shiao and the\nother lords to view. Granted liberation\nrating C. Explanation: When the Lord\nattacks, there is a 0.1% chance to deal\n100 times the damage to the enemy, but\nit must hit to take effect. It ignores\nmagic immunity, defense reduction, and\nshields. Note, critical strike potions,\nother lords critical strike auras,\ncritical strike skills, and critical\nstrike equipment bonuses only apply to\nnormal critical strikes and do not apply\nto critical strikes from graceful\nliberation. All three lords were stunned\nby this skill. First, it ignores magic\nimmunity, ignores defense reduction, and\nignores shields. Three ignores, which is\nthe standard A-level skill template.\nWhat's more, it also deals 100 times the\ndamage. It's practically at the\nthreshold of an S-Ele skill, but upon\ncloser inspection, the trigger\nprobability is only 0.1%,\nwhich is an extremely low one in a,000.\nImagine you have to slash the enemy\na,000 times to trigger 100fold damage,\nwhich translates to a, 100 slashes, but\nonly increases your combat power by 10%.\nBesides, who can fight you for a\nthousand rounds in exchange a thousand\nblows? No wonder the god system only\ngave this talent skill a C rating. He\nand two Shan by Chin both side in\nunison. The talent is great, but the\nchances of it happening are too low.\nShan Ningming was clearly aware of his\ntalent deficiency, so he didn't make any\nlarge movements and just stood there\nquietly without saying a word. Critical\nstrike potions didn't work and neither\ndid the break the boats skill infused\nwith Xiang Yu&lt;unk&gt;s heroic spirit. Lyn\nShao pondered silently for a while but\ncouldn't come up with a good solution.\nThis time he recruited three followers.\nOnly two Shawn by Chen a B rank is\nbarely worth mentioning. The other two,\nboth C rank seemed to be just bystanders\nin the battlefield of 10,000 races.\nIndeed, if they hadn't encountered him,\nthey would all be dead. But it doesn't\nmatter. The main reason for recruiting\nfollowers is for resources. All I need\nis someone to help me secure resources\nbecause I'm about to face the challenge\nfrom the official server. To prevent\nanyone from having poor grades, Lynn\nShia changed the subject. I'll reiterate\nthe rules for breaking through districts\nso you can prepare for what I'm going to\nask you to do next. The group fell\nsilent. So Lynn Shiao, the big boss, had\neven remembered such a rule.\nBreakthrough zone conquest newbie zone.\nTo prevent overly evil newbie lords from\nwreaking havoc in the newbie zone and\ncausing irreversible damage, the god\nsystem has established a rule that\nallows official server lords to enter\nthe newbie zone and engage in raids\nafter paying a certain price. At any\ngiven time, only one person can\nparticipate in a raid against a\nparticular newbie lord. Due to the\nlimitations of the underlying rules, the\nlord level in the official server will\nbe suppressed to the highest level that\ncan be accommodated in the newbie area,\nwhich is level 30. In the official\nserver, a lord can only bring a maximum\nof three heroes, and the hero level is\nalso suppressed to level 30. In the\nofficial server, lords can only use\nskills, equipment, items, etc. that are\navailable in the beginner zone. The\nofficial servers lord will arrive in the\nnew server, which will take 10 days. In\nthe official server, lords cannot build\nstructures in the newbie zone and will\nreturn immediately after completing a\nraid. The maximum number of troops a\nlord can bring in the official server.\n1,000 people. Chapter 55. A complete\ninventory of all resources. Lynn Shiao\nhad long since memorized all the rules\nbig and small of the battlefield of the\nmyriad races vying for supremacy. After\nChufunga reminded him and he realized\nthat Xiao Desang and Gene Datong were\nmortal enemies with him, he had deduced\nthe worst possible outcome. It means\nthat skilled players from the official\nserver have broken into the game and are\ncoming to attack me. The highest level\nfor the lord's mansion in the beginner\narea is level three, which corresponds\nto level 30 for the lord, the hero, and\nall wild monsters. When a normal person\nrecruits one hero, the other party will\nat most bring three level 30 heroes.\n1,000 troops, enough to deal with 10 mo\nIron Guards, 10 divine arm archers, and\n42 phantom archers. But no matter how\nmany regions you conquer, it will still\ntake 10 days. These 10 days are enough\nfor me to get a lot done. Tier one\nallows you to build farmhouses and\nrecruit farmers. Tier 2 allows you to\nbuild barracks and recruit your existing\ntroops. You can also build hero specific\nbuildings and equip your hero with their\nown unique troops. With just three\nbooks, you can build stables to produce\nwar horses and barracks can produce\ncavalry. Resources. We need a lot of\nresources to produce these units with\nthe bonuses from eternal peace. peace\n100% increase in construction upgrade\nand production speed of all buildings\nplus 100 defense of all city defense\nsystems and eternal peace conflict 20%\nincrease in attributes and abilities of\nall troop types divine beasts and heroes\nplus 20% increase in loyalty of all\ntroop types divine beasts and heroes\nplus 100% increase in troop production\nyou can quickly produce troops but you\nwill need more resources\nBesides the difference in the number of\ntroop types, the difference in the level\nof one's own side is also a big problem.\nThis also requires a huge amount of\nexperience. In short, the solution to\nthis problem is to overcome force with\nforce, leaving no room for shortcuts. In\nprevious years, there have been\ncountless cases of novice lords being\nattacked and subjugated by established\nlords, with very few novice lords\nemerging victorious. But those who did\nwin invariably became powerful overlords\nor formidable villains. I entered the\nbattlefield with the goal of becoming\nnumber one in the newbie zone, then\nentering the official zone and even the\ndragon summer domain and blue star realm\nto achieve great things. How can I be\nafraid and lose my edge just because\nsome petty people are blocking my way?\nTherefore, Lynn Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s choice to\nconfront the invasion head-on can be\nseen as a testament to the backbone of\nthe Chinese people he has cultivated in\nboth his previous lives. First,\nresources. Second, experience. These are\nthe things I need most urgently. Lyn Sha\nthought to himself, \"In my memory\npalace, I have only occupied less than\nonetenth of the resources in my entire\nCalabash mountain range. Hi, Tu Shan by\nChian and Chun Ningming are all my\nneighbors. Taking them as vassal lords\ncan not only protect my territory,\nprovide early warnings, and ensure\nsafety, but also help me occupy and\nexploit resources. As for experience, go\nall out and grind monsters. No need to\noverthink it. Let's get started. Lyn\nShia immediately opened his resource\npanel and carefully reviewed all his\nresources. Having survived the S level\ndemonic tide and having sent out heroes\nand troops to kill monsters and then\nkilled Xiao Datang and Gene Dang,\ngaining some spoils of war, his\nresources are now vastly different from\nwhat they used to be. Lords all\nresources panel experience 9,654,100,\nnearly 2 million from the Demon Tide\nsettlement, plus several million\nexperience from the Demon Tide itself.\nGold coins 139,864.\nBaoi smile cost over 10,000. Ziao Datang\nand Gene Dang won over 20,000. And the\nDemon Tide settlement yielded over\n60,000. Excellent treasure chest five\nrare treasure chests. Three excellent\ntreasure chest three epic chests. Zero\nlegendary treasure chest zero items\npurple excellent quality defense charm.\nOne fine quality spirit field one common\nquality leader charm two green fine\nquality recruitment charm three green\nfine quality hero token one blue rare\nquality hero token one epic quality\nrecruitment charm one teleportation\ncharm two gold legendary hashu building\nblueprint one now hero recruitment for\ntier 2 and tier three heroes is\navailable with hero tokens but\nrecruitment tokens and civic tokens are\nrelatively scarce and in high demand And\nin the newbie zone, equipment, black\nlong sword, rare weapon on auction.\nMalay sword, highquality weapon. Black\nwind axe, rare weapon. Critical strike\nbow, rare weapon equipped by soldering.\nDance of fine snow, rare weapon equipped\nby Pay Min. Horse slaying saber, rare\nweapon equipped by Tang Yi. Life amulet,\nsuperior equipment. Demon suppressing\nshield, superior equipment. Scale rock\nshoulder pads, scale rock breastplate,\nscale rock belt, scale rock leggings,\npurple excellent set for fifths\ncomplete. Knight's lance lilac epic\nweapon. Falian epic weapon. Forest\nwitch's cloak special epic equipment. Ba\nis wearing it. Bold text can be removed.\nSpecial Battlefield of all races energy\n6200. 1,000 was consumed when using the\ncelestial perspective. Resources: Timber\n35740,\nstone 29542,\niron or 13532,\ncopper or 1 9730,\nsilver or 3854,\nrefined iron 3951, refined copper 5187,\ngold or 370, sulfur 250, gemstone or 150\nfood 5,320\nunits of superior spirit rice, 550 units\nof lava giant lizard, 150 units of wild\nbeef, and 300 units of flame ram. These\nare all of Linhao's resources. Also,\nregarding levels, I am level 10. He did\na quick calculation. The current 41\nphantom archers are level 11. Saulin is\none level higher. The nine iron guards\nof the Mod Dao are level six. Tang Yi is\none level higher. And the nine divine\narchers are level five. S Ruer is one\nlevel higher. Upgrading these troop\ntypes to level 30 would probably require\na massive amount of experience and 10\ndays might not be enough. Some choices\nmust be made. If everything goes\nsmoothly during this period, some new\nunits will be recruited and those units\nwill also need to be upgraded. As for\nthe two heroes, Ba is level one and Pay\nMin is also level one. Pay Min, who is\ngazing at him with a sorrowful\nexpression. It seems that I have sent\nout Pay Min, the legendary hero of the\nTang Dynasty and a level one swordsman\nto wipe out the gathering points of\nvarious level 30 epic creatures.\nReckless? That's incredibly reckless.\nAfter the demon tide, Payman could have\nleveled up to at least level 10 in one\ngo. Reckless as to challenge a level 30\nopponent. Only a hero like Pay Min, who\nspecializes in attack power, would dare\nto do it. Lynn Sha hurriedly walked\ntowards pay men only to see that his\nblue robe was stained with blood stains\nand his dance of fine snow aura was also\nfilled with blood but his overall spirit\nand temperament were still quite good.\nPay men were you injured in the battle\nwith the nest demon? Lyn Sha asked\nearnestly reporting to my lord I am\nunharmed. The ice attribute attack dance\nof fine snow given by you is precisely\nwhat counters the nest demon. Next time\nit would be better if you, my lord, let\nme level up a few times. H, he and Tan\nby Chin gasped. They knew about the nest\ndemon. The lowest level 30 epic monsters\nwere boss level monsters in the beginner\narea. This hero of Lin Sha named Pay Min\ndares to face a level 30 nest demon\nmonster. And judging from his tone, it\nseems he even won. What kind of hero is\nPay Min? The two exchanged a glance,\nboth secretly glad that they had\ndecisively sided with boss Lyn Sha. This\nLin Shia is unfathomable. The female\nhero is as beautiful as a flower, and\nthe male hero is invincible. I'll level\neveryone up in a bit before we go out to\nfarm monsters. Lyn Sha could only\nchuckle in response for supremacy among\nall races. Only lords can upgrade their\nsubordinates, which is indeed somewhat\ninconvenient. By the way, my lord, after\nI killed the nest demon lord, this is\none of these things. Payman was 29\nlevels higher than the level cap, and he\nalso obtained the most items. Most of\nthe talismans were dropped by Pay Min.\nPayman took out separately. Normally,\nthe items that dropped just flashed with\nwhite light and flew into the lord's\nwarehouse. Payman reached out and took\nout a miniature version of the monster.\nThe monster was entirely red, writhing\nin his hand like a jellyfish. Chapter\n56. Mini nest demon. Legendary spirit\nfield. This is a mini version of a nest\ndemon. Mini nest demon. Race demon.\nLevel one. Quality epic. Attributes.\nStrength 25, spirit 15, constitution 25,\nsoul 15. Combat power rating 20 stars.\nskills, regeneration, infection, flame\nimmunity, reproduction. Note: Nest demon\ncubs can grow by feeding them large\namounts of flesh and blood. Lyn Sha was\ntaken aback after slaughtering all the\nnest demon lords. A small nest demon\nactually dropped. In Lyn Xiao's memory,\nthere were no nest demon nests in the\nnewbie zone that allowed him to recruit\nnest demons once he captured them.\nOtherwise, he would have really wanted\nto recruit a few to fight against the\nupcoming official zone lord. But what's\nwith this little nest demon? It actually\nlooks kind of cute. The little nest\ndemon bounced and swayed in Payman's\nhands, but showed no aggression, perhaps\nbecause it was intimidated by the\nmurderous aura emanating from Pay Min.\nLyn Sha shook his head helplessly and\nsaid, \"Since it wasn't directly put into\nthe god's warehouse, it's a special\nitem. Seeing how much this little guy\nlikes to follow you. Pay Min, you can\nkeep it for now. Pay Min didn't mince\nwords and chuckled in agreement. Lynn\nSha turned to Hi, Tu Shan by Chian and\nChun Ningming and said, \"Your territory\nhas been almost completely destroyed.\nNow that you have become my vassal\nlords, I have an obligation to help you\nrise again. I also have two ordinary\nquality leader tokens, three green\nexcellent quality recruit tokens, and\ntwo weapons dropped by Xiao Daong and\nGene Dang, a Malay sword and a Black\nWind axe. Each of you will receive one\ncitizenship token and one recruitment\ntoken. Whoever doesn't want the\ncitizenship token will get a weapon and\ncan exchange it for a citizenship token\nat the auction house. There are three\nvassal lords and Lyn Shiao can only\ndivide them up in this way. In fact,\nLinja's other option was to keep the\nrecruitment token for himself and use\nthe Hasha summoning to turn it into a\ntop tier Hasha recruitment token to\nsummon Hasha troops. However, doing so\nwould greatly slow down the recovery\nspeed of the three people. Moreover, he\ncould wait until the three people\nrecovered, then give them the\nrecruitment tokens and then summon\nChinese soldiers. The three exchanged\nglances. He asked, \"Brother Lyn Sha,\ndoes your lord's manner here have a\nhealing function?\" Lynsha nodded. His\nlegendary lord's manner had several\nfunctions, and healing was just one of\nthem. Tu Shan by Chin and Chun Ningming\nimmediately understood why Chun Ningming\nwas seriously injured, but he has now\nvisibly recovered a lot. It turns out\nthat those wispy green lights were the\nhealing effects of Lord Lin Xiao's\nmanner. He visibly breathed a sigh of\nrelief. Brother Lynn Sha, give me a\npiece of spirit field, just a regular\nquality one, and put it in your\nterritory. This way, I won't need the\nlord's token and the recruitment token.\nMy lord's talent is flower fairy, and\nI'm best at using the flower fairy. Lynn\nShia didn't know what he wanted it for.\nBut since he didn't want farmers or\nsoldiers, it would be easier for him to\ndistribute them to the other two. So he\nreached out and gave Heay a piece of\nhighquality spiritual land and a Malay\nsword dropped by Gene Data. Heay was\noverjoyed and immediately left to go\nfarming. Lyn Shao then gave Tu Sha by\nChin an ordinary civilian talisman and\ntwo excellent soldier recruitment\ntalismans and Shiningming an ordinary\ncivilian talisman and an excellent\nsoldier recruitment talisman. In\naddition to Ziao Datangs weapon, the\nBlack Wind axe with her petite frame.\nZay may really couldn't wield the Black\nWind axe. It would even hinder her\nagility. Now that they had the resources\nto make a comeback, the two were eager\nto return to their territory and\nrebuild. Please wait here for a while\nand Shin Ningming can continue to heal\nfor a period of time. I'll give you\nsomething in a moment, then you can\nleave. After saying that, Lyn Shao\nwalked into the Lord&lt;unk&gt;'s mansion.\nAfter receiving the gift, the two began\nto wander around Linia's territory. over\nhere. Shufinga with his red hair led two\nteams of berserkers and just managed to\nkill the last monster in front of them.\nPhew. A B-ranked demonic tide is already\nquite difficult for me. I really don't\nknow how Lynn Shao managed to deal with\nthat sky full of meteor fire rained\ndemonic tide. I wonder what level of\ndemonic tide that fierce woman Dugu\nJaolon was dealing with. This hall must\nhave been pretty good. With a nonchalant\nsmile, Shufinga slowly opened the\nresource panel, checked his resources,\nand then slowly opened the chat channel\nto see if he had missed any information\nrecently. Gradually, his expression\nchanged from relaxed to serious, and\nthen from serious to a bitter face. Oh\nno, dad's probably going to kill me now.\nChufinga switched to the communication\nchannel and sure enough, saw dozens of\nmissed calls and a message from Chui.\nYou unfil son, come to me at once. Chin\nNingming was a gloomy man who rarely\nspoke unless necessary. So Tu Shan by\nChin chattered incessantly as she\nwatched. Wow, Lyn Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s territory\nis huge. What kind of Lord's mansion can\noccupy such a large territory? Wow, Lyn\nXiao&lt;unk&gt;s troops all look so cool. Not\na single person even glanced at me.\nThat's because you're not charming\nenough. Wow, boss Lin Shia already has\nseveral farmers building houses. Is he\npreparing to expand the population? Tu\nShan by Chan rubbed her eyes and then\nsaw several farmers tilling the land.\nWhy are Lyn Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s farmers so fast?\nI saw them swinging their hoes so fast\nthey were almost blurry. Ridiculous. If\na hoe can leave after images, then if I\ngave my talent to this farmer, wouldn't\nhe be able to kill a boss? Chin Ningming\nsaid dismissively. His powerful sounding\nbut ultimately useless Lord talent is\nhis eternal pain. There it is over\nthere. Chin Ningming looked in the\ndirection Tu Shawn by Chin pointed. A\nfew seconds later, he silently rubbed\nhis eyes. Since Lin Sha built the legend\nfarmhouse this morning, two legend\nfarmers have been produced every hour,\nand now eight legend farmers have been\nproduced. What the two saw was several\nlegendary farmers cultivating the\nlegendary farmland. This is a legendary\nfarmer. Lynn Shiao had walked over\nunnoticed, holding three scrolls in his\nhand. he said calmly. Be more efficient\nat work. Upon seeing his farmers tending\nto the spirit field, Lin Sha immediately\nchecked the attributes. Linken quality\nlegendary output 126,000\nunits. Time 12 2.4 hours. Special effect\none. When consumed randomly increases\none of the following attributes by two\npoints, strength, spirit, body, or soul.\nThis effect can only be applied once\nevery 24 hours. Special effect two, when\nconsumed, there is a very small chance\nto increase the user's skill level up to\na maximum of B level. Special effect\nthree, when consumed, there is a very\nsmall chance that it will increase the\nuser's lifespan and maintain a youthful\nappearance. Lyn Sha nodded secretly.\nLegend has it that the spirit rice is\neven better than the spirit fish in the\nepic pond. Not only does it add two\nattribute points when you eat it, but it\nalso has a small chance to increase the\nlifespan and keep you young forever.\nWith the legendary spirit field, the\nsuper fast production speed combined\nwith my talent has meant that I haven't\nhad to worry about food shortages for\nsome time now. It's practically a bug.\nMoreover, this legendary spirit rice\nwhen fed to troops and heroes can\ntransform mediocre troops and heroes\ninto powerful ones and can also increase\nlifespan and maintain appearance. No\nwonder the legendary spirit rice on the\nmarket can sell for exorbitant prices\nand is almost entirely monopolized by\nmajor forces in the official server and\nabove. That's why many season masters\nsuch as the rumored queen of dragon\nsummer domain still look like young\npeople and their ages are hard to guess.\nThis can be considered one of the\nbenefits of the battlefield where all\nraces v for supremacy. Although only the\ntop management can enjoy it because of\nthe legendary farmers. Each person can\ndirectly cultivate a plot of such\nspiritual land. At this moment, Tu Shan\nby Chin and Chin Ningming seemed quite\nuncomfortable. legendary farmer. Tu Shan\nby Chin and Chun Ningming exchanged a\nglance, both seeing the shock in each\nother's eyes. Could this be recruited by\nan F-ranked talent lord? Lyn Sha, as\nexpected, is incredibly well hidden.\nI've made the right choice and following\nhim. But to be told such a confidential\nmatter like this, are we all knowing too\nmuch? If we leave Lin Xiao's company,\nwill we be silenced? Tu Shan by Chian\nimmediately broke out in a cold sweat\nwhile Chun Ningming was somewhat better\nbut still dared not move. Seeing their\nexpressions, Lin Sha knew what they were\nthinking without even having to guess.\nIt wasn't that he revealed it randomly.\nRather, it was rumored that in his\nsubsequent plans, the farmers would be\nsent to various places to mine resources\nand his subordinate lords would\neventually find out. By the way, where's\nhe? Did he finish farming? He also got a\nshare of these scrolls. Yes, yes, my\nlittle sister is also looking for Heay.\nTu Shan by Chin immediately found a\nreason and hurriedly pulled Chun\nNingming away. The charming cheers of\nthe flower fairies could be heard and he\nshouted from afar, \"It's done.\" His\nvoice was filled with undisguised\nexcitement. Chapter 57. These flower\nfairies are all mine. It turned out that\nhe and the flower fairies were arranging\na spiritual field in front of them. The\nflower fairies scattered poisonous seeds\nwhich were originally intended to attack\nenemies, but now they all fell into the\nspirit field. The fine spiritual field\nwas emitting faint green light, and many\nplants that no one recognized were\ngrowing inside. These plants absorbed\nthe spiritual energy contained in the\nspiritual field while extending their\nroots to devour the seeds sewn by the\nflower fairies. Then these plants grew\nwildly, quickly, reaching about the\nheight of a person and even sprouting\nhuge flower buds. The giant flower\nswayed from side to side, and he and the\nflower fairy shouted excitedly at that\nmoment. Lyn Sha led Tu Shan by Chin and\nChuning Ming closer and saw that the\nentire spirit field was full of huge\nplants, and the flower buds on the\nplants beat rhythmically like a human\nheart. Master Lynsha, he was delighted\nto see Lyn Sha arrive. You've come at\nthe perfect time. Thanks to your spirit\nfield, I've successfully grown a flower\nfairy. Lyn Shia had a premonition that a\nflower fairy was being grown. But he\nnever expected that this kid was\nactually growing a flower fairy. The\nknowledge I learned in class was that\nflower fairies were produced in wild\nnests or in the fairy forest. I had\nnever actually grown a flower fairy. I\nunderstand. So, this is how flower\nfairies are grown. Tan by Chin\nexclaimed. No wonder you don't need\nrecruitment tokens anymore. You can\nproduce flower fairies endlessly just by\nusing your spirit fields. Is it an\nability inherited from your family?\nLynsha asked. He Lyn Shiao is truly\namazing. He saw right through her at a\nglance. What does this pretty girl know?\nHe laughed. In the entire Dragon Sa\nKingdom, only our family's flower\nfairies are cultivated. Other family's\nflower fairies are either wild or\nrecruited, unlike ours. As he spoke,\nHeay straightened his hair and stood\nupright in front of Ling Tion.\nUnderneath his school uniform, he\nactually had a fairly handsome face,\nthough his dark circles marred some of\nhis good looks. The enormous plants had\nstopped growing while the flower buds\ngrew larger and larger, throbbing faster\nand faster. With a tearing sound, a\nflower bud that had swelled to its\nfullest extent made a sound, and a pair\nof slender hands reached out from\ninside. Then the petals were torn open\nand a beautiful and alluring elf's head\nemerged. The first thing she saw was he\nstanding in front of her smiling. He he\nlord I knew you were all right. The\nnewborn flower fairy broke free of the\npetals and emerged completely from the\nbud. She was now the same size as the\nother flower fairies. She shook her\nfairy wings and flew to Heay. My lord,\nthose red-skinned monsters were\nterrifying. Thankfully, you are safe and\nsound. My lord, didn't I ask you to\nforget about me? You still insist on\ncultivating me. So, what should I be\ncalled? Your name is Yao Yao, Heay said\nwith a smile, his expression calm. The\nsound of flowers being torn apart\nechoed, and one flower fairy after\nanother emerged. Does my lord remember\nmy name? Your name is Yao Yao. Wow, Lord\nYao Yao still remembers Yaoya. Yao Yao\nis so touched. My lord, I killed a wild\nboar during the battle. Haven't you\nforgotten me? Of course, I haven't\nforgotten. You're my little devil. What\nabout me? Yao Yao, I miss you so much.\nAnd what about me, my lord? You're Yao\nYao. With a warm, gentle smile, he\nresponded earnestly and sincerely to\neach of the flower fairies. Lin Shiao,\nTu Shan by Chien, and Chun Ningming\nstood blankly behind them like wooden\nfigures. Looking at Heay's deep dark\ncircles and slender build, combined with\nhis smile that could captivate any girl,\nLin Sha couldn't help but feel a pang of\nemotion. This works. In other words, the\ntime management master didn't come into\nthis world. Otherwise, he would probably\nhave deeply understood a principle. I'm\nnot a jerk. I just want to give every\ngirl a home, and I have the ability to\ndo so. The three of them watched quietly\nas he welcomed each newborn flower fairy\nuntil all the buds matured and burst\nopen. Then, smiling, he turned around\nwith a multitude of flower fairies and\nbowed to Lyn Sha. This is boss Lyn Sha.\nHe's my lord. You should call him Lord.\nA large group of flower fairies\nimmediately bowed gracefully and\nrespectfully said, \"My lord. A sound\nsuddenly came from behind Lyn Shao. It\nturned out that Chun Ningming had\ncoughed up blood from his nose. It turns\nout that those newborn flower fairies\nhad just emerged from the flower buds\nand were completely naked. Such a large\ngroup of flower fairies bowing in unison\nis a sight to behold. What young\nspirited man could possibly resist such\na sight? Fairies, hurry up and put on\nyour clothes. He immediately understood.\nwaved for the flower fairies to leave\nand then explained helplessly to the\ngroup. We're&lt;unk&gt; so used to seeing this\nthat we've forgotten about it. Lin\nShiao/chining\nMing to Shan by Chian. Shameless. While\nthe flower fairies flew back to their\nspawn point to find plants to cover\nthemselves, Lin Sha asked, \"These flower\nfairies are the ones you use to\nself-destruct and stop the attack. Are\nthey still alive?\" Eay said with some\npride. As long as there is one flower\nfairy left in our family, we can keep\ngrowing more from the spirit field. But\nit must be a spirit field with the\nfunction of healing. Originally, I plan\nto have my family replant them after\nreturning to the real world. But I\ndidn't expect that boss Linhao's\nterritory would have healing effects.\nSo, this is a perfect way to make up for\nit. So, you only brought one type of\nunit, the flower fairy, for all 10\nslots. reporting to my lord. Yao Yao is\na domesticated flower fairy. She's not\nonly an excellent soldier, but she can\nalso be an excellent farmer. A flower\nfairy dressed in clothes flew over with\na grin and answered, \"Yes, no wonder\nthese flower fairies are so unruly.\nTheir previous statements were so\noutrageous. It turns out they're not\nafraid of death. They can grow back\nafter they die. No wonder Heay wasn't\nsaddened at all when he made the flower\ndemon self-destruct. Moreover, the\nflower fairies raised by Hizay's family\nare a group that are both soldiers and\nfarmers. Judging from this, Heay's\nlordly talent seems to have some\npotential, and he may be able to develop\nfurther in the future. By the way, he\ncan your spirit field keep producing\nflower fairies. Brother Lyn Shia, I only\nhave 10 citizen leadership tokens. The\nones I've grown are all the 100 flower\nfairies I already had. If I want new\nflower fairies, I'll have to recruit\nthem using recruitment tokens or citizen\nleadership tokens. Before he could\nfinish speaking, Lyn Sha reached out and\nhanded his three green highquality\ncitizen tokens. He was stunned. No one's\nselling recruitment tokens. I just\nsnapped up all the highquality leader\ntokens at the auction house. Keep\nplanting flower fairies for me. I need\nthem. Lynn Shiao said in a deep voice.\nOh, I understand. Tu Shan by Chien\nstanding to the side suddenly realized\nhe's flower fairies can serve as\nsoldiers or farmers and they can even\nrevive after dying. Using them to scout,\nfarm, and occupy wild mineral veins will\nbe extremely efficient. You won't even\nneed to wait for farmers to come from\nyour territory. He suddenly realized\nthat upper level lords could use the\ntroops of subordinate lords. Yes, boss\nLyn Shao, I'll go plant flower fairies\nright away. I guarantee I'll plant 30\nflower fairies for you as quickly as\npossible. No, Lyn Sha said in a deep\nvoice. The three recruitment tokens are\nfor you to plant, and all 100 of your\nflower fairies are under my control.\nHe's a huh chapter 58 upgrade. The\nImperial spirit possesses him. Within\nLyn Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s territory, Lynn Shiao had\nlunch with the three subordinate lords\nand his two heroes before seeing them\noff. All three of them were holding the\nscrolls that Lynn Shiao had given them.\nThat was a map drawn by Lin Shiao using\nhis own memories, a map he saw from the\nperspective of a god. The map\nencompasses the main terrain and major\nroads within a radius of nearly a\nthousand km centered on Lynch and marks\nimportant locations and dangerous wild\nanimals. The main problem is that the\narea is too vast, making it unrealistic\nto create a detailed map. Lyn Shao could\nonly mark key areas. Of course, Lynsha\ndid not draw any of the areas inside the\nCalabash Mountains. In his eyes, this\nplace had long been his own private\ndomain, and he would not allow anyone\nelse to encroach upon it. Even so, when\nthe three maps were handed to the group,\neveryone was still stunned. First came\nthe powerful and mysterious Gust Archer,\nthen the towering armored soldier, and\nfinally the mysterious hero who could\nfight the nest demon alone, and the\ngolden peasant. There is still a map\ncovering nearly a thousand square kilm.\nIn their eyes, the mysterious number one\ngenius of Jang Dong, Lin Shia, who is a\nuseless person with an F-level lord\ntalent, must have more hidden trump\ncards and must be a low-key big shot.\nThe beautiful girl even imagined a\nmelodramatic story where Lynn Shiao had\nto deliberately bury his talent and hide\nin the battlefield of the myriad races\nto avoid his persistent and unruly\nfemale rival. Overall, all of them\nachieved good results. The beautiful two\nShan by Chian obtained a civilian token\nand two excellent recruitment tokens.\nChun Ningming also obtained a civilian\ntoken and an excellent recruitment token\nand also acquired the rare weapon black\nwind axe and recovered from his\ninjuries. Even Heay didn't come away\nempty-handed. He acquired a Malay sword,\na piece of fine farmland, and 30 new\nflower fairies, which was better than\nwhen he had come in a sorry state with\nonly 23 flower fairies. Although all the\nflower fairies are named Yao Yao, the\ngroup then left with the tasks assigned\nby Lin Shiao. give any recruitment\ntokens of any quality that dropped to\nLyn Shia immediately. He can have as\nmany as he wants. After the others left,\nLyn Shiao summoned all the troops and\nheroes and after calculations quickly\nupgraded all the heroes and troops.\nWithout a doubt, Lyn Xiao's strongest\ncombat force at present, the great Tang\nSword Saint Pay Min was directly\nupgraded by 10 levels. With a flash of\nlight, the wandering swordsman holding\nthe dance of fine snow and looking like\na carefree rogue completed his level up.\nSword Saint Payman race human.\nQuality golden legend. Level 10.\nAttributes strength 108 + 22. Spirit 113\n+ 23. Constitution 75 + 15 soul 65 + 13.\nskills. Sacrifice to break through\nillusions, Srank.

Exclusive\nunit type, ranger. I thank you, my lord.\nFrom this moment on, I am confident that\nI can defeat any enemy here. Pay Min\nbowed to express his gratitude, and Lyn\nSha nodded and accepted it graciously\nwhile pondering Pay Min's attributes.\nPaymen's main attributes are strength\nand spirit, which have increased by five\npoints per level based on the current\nprogress. His secondary attribute is\nbody, which has increased by two points\nper level. Soul is the most mysterious\nattribute, which is vague even in\ntextbooks, somewhat like quantum\nmechanics in my previous life. Many\ncommon or rare units only have around 10\npoints, even at dozens of levels. Soul\nis usually only slightly higher for\nmages and warlocks, and Payman only\nadded one point per level. A level 10\nlegendary hero already has stats\ncomparable to a level 30 epic monster.\nMoreover, Payman's skills are all\nincredibly powerful, making him truly\nunstoppable in the newbie zone. Don't be\ncareless. There are still powerful\noutdoor buildings in the beginner area,\nsuch as the monster treasure house, the\ndestruction castle, and the house of\ndeath. The monsters inside are also very\nstrong. Continue upgrading the Mod Dao\niron guards and the divine arm archers\nall to level 10.

Lynn Shao secretly estimated\nthat the MO Dao iron guards and the\ndivine arm archers were both legendary\nunits enjoying the same treatment of\nadding five or four points to their main\nattributes per level. Moreover, they had\nalso learned the pan long staff\ntechnique which permanently increased\nall their attributes by 10 points.\nTherefore, the current panel attributes\nare also terrifyingly powerful, only\nslightly inferior to the level 30 epic\nnest demon, completely crushing any unit\nof the same level. In comparison, the MO\nDAO Iron Guards have higher strength and\nphysique, making them pure melee combat\npowerhouses. The divine arm archer has\nvirtually no weaknesses. Its strength\nand spirit attributes are all top tier.\nAll the soldiers knelt on the ground\nagain to thank their lord. This time it\nwas Solderin's turn to use his phantom\narchers. Lyn Shia used up his remaining\nexperience points to level up all the\ngreenclad elves to level 15. Although\nthere are many phantom archers and their\nlevels are high, they require less\nexperience points than Tang Yi and Song\nRuer because they are an excellent unit.\nPhantom shooter soldering level 15\nquality excellent attributes strength 30\n+ 6 spirit 42 + 8 constitution 22 + 4\nsoul 16 + 3 combat power rating 31 stars\nskills rapid fire long range sniping\nafter looking at the phantom archer\nstats Lyn Sha forced himself to suppress\nthe urge to cover his face and sigh This\nattribute is really too bad. A level 15\nphantom archer is only equivalent to a\nlevel one divine archer and the skills\nare also much worse. However, phantom\narchers are now Lyn Xiao's main force on\nthe surface and he needs them to show\ntheir skills on many occasions. So, Lyn\nShao has also upgraded them. Lyn Shiao\nalso vaguely felt that it would be best\nfor his Chinese troops to show\nthemselves less often. As for the other\nheroine, the peerless enchantress Ba and\nthe 100 flower fairies he had stolen,\nLin Shiao didn't level them up. Firstly,\nbecause they didn't have enough\nexperience. Secondly, Baoi is a\nrule-based hero. She has not yet shown\nher combat ability, and Lyn Sha has not\nyet dealt with all of her negative\nskills. It is unknown whether leveling\nup will increase the difficulty. Lyn Sha\nhas other uses for the flower fairies,\nso he doesn't need to upgrade them for\nthe time being. Once we enter the\nofficial zone and upgrade to a higher\nlevel base, all lords can choose to let\ntheir troops freely gain experience and\nlevel up, which will reduce a lot of\ntrouble and allocation. During this\nupgrade, Lynsha also noticed that the\nbonuses for all hero units had\ndecreased. The reason is simple. Xiang\nYu's spirit disappeared the next day and\nthe 30% bonus to all attributes from\nXang Yu's command a level skill also\ndisappeared. So currently his\nsubordinates only have Lin Xiao's\neternal peace strife 20% bonus to all\nattributes. I still have several\nthousand energy points left in the\nbattlefield of myriad races. Let's try\nadding another Chinese Imperial Spirit\nto increase our combat power. Use the\nHasha decree heroic spirit possession. A\ngolden light shone down from the sky,\npiercing through the endless mist on the\nbattlefield of myriad races and shining\nupon Lin Sha. Chapter 59. Emperor Taizu\nand Emperor Taong of song have arrived.\nA golden light shone down from the sky,\npiercing through the endless fog on the\nbattlefield of all races. A faint\nmajestic chanting arose from the heavens\nand earth, making the surrounding\natmosphere solid and heavy, as if one\nwere in the midst of a battlefield with\nclashing swords and galloping horses, or\nas if residing high in the heavens,\noverlooking all living beings. The\nendless spirits of Chinese emperors\nreappeared beside Lyn Shao, constantly\nlingering, flickering, and observing.\nLiao&lt;unk&gt;s consciousness had entered an\nunknown space. He carefully tried to\nidentify the emperors he recognized. A\nfigure drifted past me. Could this aura\nbelong to Chin Shir Huang, the first\nemperor of all time? Lyn Shiao excitedly\nreached out, but Inhan seemed to only\nglance at Lin Shia indifferently before\ndisappearing in a flash. Lyn Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s\nhand froze in midair for a moment. Does\nthis mean they looked down on me? The\nemperors continued to flash, and Lyn Sha\nsaw another emperor&lt;unk&gt;'s spirit with a\nmajestic appearance and extraordinary\nbones piercing the top of his head, full\nof masculine spirit and an indomitable\nwill. This appearance must be old Je. It\nturns out old Zu didn't have a long,\nnarrow face, nor did he look as\ndignified and imposing as depicted in\nportraits. Instead, he was ugly\nhandsome, unforgettable at first glance.\nLyn Shao thought to himself and reached\nout to touch this heroic spirit. But the\nspirit only glanced at Lyn Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s\nfair and slender fingers before dodging\naway on its own. Lyn Shia was stunned\nagain. Was it the spirits of Chinese\nheroes possessing him? Or was it a\ntwo-way journey? As he glanced around, a\nfamiliar figure approached Lyn Sha. This\nman had a round face, dark skin, and a\ntall stature. He looked incredibly bold\nand had an extraordinary bearing. He was\ndefinitely a big strong man from the\nnorth. This was the very figure who\ntaught Lin Shia the panlong staff\ntechnique when he first leveled up to\nlevel 10. Emperor Taisu of Song Xiao\nKuang Yin. This is someone who based\nsolely on military strength would\ndefinitely rank among the top 10 of all\nemperors including emperors and kings\nincluding Xiang Yu and Ran Min. With\nEmperor Taou of Song on our side, this\nwave is in the bag within 24 hours. Lin\nShao was overjoyed and his consciousness\ntook a step towards Emperor Taizu of\nSong Ziao Kuangin. Just as the human and\nthe soul were about to meet, a heroic\nfigure resembling Xiao Kuangin suddenly\nrushed out from the side. The spirit\nshoved Xiao Kuangin aside and before Lin\nShao could react, threw himself on top\nof him. In an instant, the spirits of\nthe Chinese heroes were possessed. Lin\nShao snapped back to reality and\nimmediately began to check. Emperor\nTaong of Song, Xiao Guangi. Ability\nborrowing level one. Degree of\nintegration extremely low. Duration 24\nhours. Abilities click to view. Black\ngod of slaughter. Candle shadow and axe\nsound. Sorghum river chariot god.\nReading is beneficial. Silent judgment.\nIt was none other than Emperor Taisu of\nsong. Xiao Kuangi. Xiao Kuangin&lt;unk&gt;s\nyounger brother should be all right. Lin\nShiao breathed a sigh of relief. The\nworst case scenario he had imagined did\nnot occur. At least it wasn't the king\nof Chong Ban Slope, General Zhu X, or\nthe Emperor Hui of Gene who refused to\neat meat porridge who came. But upon\nseeing the skill description, Lin Xiao's\nface darkened again. Black god of\nslaughter. When the lord and his\ntroops/h heroes use poison, the toxicity\nis increased by 100% and the recipe for\nthe S-level poison, the poison of the\nmachine, is obtained. Candle shadow and\naxe sound increases all attributes by\n50% in dark environments and at night,\nlimited to the lord only. Increases\nhatred towards relatives by 50% due to\nits high degree of disguise. The loyalty\nof all subordinate troops and heroes\nwith a loyalty of less than 80 is\ntemporarily increased to 80. Gallong\nRiver Chariot God increases speed and\nrange of any animal-drawn vehicle, horse\ncarriage, donkey cart, ox cart, etc. by\n100%. Negative impact. Zia Guangi is\nignorant of military affairs. All troop\nand hero leadership values decrease and\nall troop/hero attributes under his\ncommand decrease by 10%. Reading is\nbeneficial. Increases the learning\nability of the lord and all his/heroes\nby 20%, memory by 20% and affinity for\nbooks by 20%. Decisive strategist. The\nhistory of Song praises Emperor Taong\nXiao Kuangi saying the emperor was\ndecisive and resourceful and possessed\nthe ambition to pacify the world. Some\ncommentators add but he was incompetent.\nFurther note, this skill has no\nbeneficial or detrimental effects. What\nkind of weird skill is that? Lyn Sha\ncouldn't help but want to look up to the\nsky and sigh. reading is beneficial. So\nwhy would he send rough men like the\niron guards with their long swords and\narchers with their divine crossbows to\ntake the imperial examinations of the\nmyriad races with its flickering candle\nlight and the clanging of axes is\nextremely dangerous at night. Apart from\ntheir territories and the mineral\nresources they have already occupied,\nventuring out poses a great danger.\nShould they send him to fight headon?\nWhat's with this level of hatred towards\nfamily members? I don't have any family\nmembers. What's with this unit loyalty\nsystem? Which of my units or heroes has\na loyalty level above 80? The flower\nfairies he stole use poisonous seeds?\nDecisive strategist is a skill that has\nno effect whatsoever. It has neither\npositive nor negative effects. So why is\nit listed here? The funniest thing is\nthe Gallong river cart god. He increases\nthe speed and range of animal drawn\nvehicles by 100%. Even if your donkey\ncart flies, what good will it do? What's\nmore, it even reduces all attributes by\n10%. Now look what's happened. My 20%\nincrease in all attributes has been\nreduced by 10%. Ziao Guangi trying to\ndo. These skills have their pros and\ncons, but they don't suit me at all.\nThere's also the question of why Zia\nGuani took his brother's place at the\nlast minute and squeezed into my\nposition. With a thousand wild horses\ngalloping through his mind, Lyn Sha took\nseveral deep breaths and slowly calmed\ndown. No amount of complaining will\nhelp. The spirit of the emperor of China\npossesses him for 24 hours at a time,\nduring which he will have to work with\nXiaoani. We need to turn our\ndisadvantages into advantages. In\naddition, we can't stop going out to\nhunt monsters and seize resources. Lyn\nShao pondered, \"The trapping drug is an\nS-class poison. I need to memorize this\nformula. The flower fairies use poison.\nWith Xiao Guangi's heroic spirit\npossessing them, their combat power has\nincreased by a level. They can probably\nbe used as a rare type of soldier.\nBesides, they are not afraid of death.\nNot wanting to waste any time during the\nday, Lyn Sha quickly arranged the\ndeployment of all the troops. Even\nwithout any buffs, their legendary units\nand heroes are still ridiculously\nstrong. He now needs to grind monsters\nto meet his massive resource and\nexperience demands. Tonight will upgrade\ndirectly to a second tier university.\nLyn Sha then clicked to recruit 20 more\ngolden farmers who lined up in the\nfarmhouse to be recruited with two being\nrecruited every hour. With the first\nbatch of legendary spirit fields\nripening, there is more than enough food\nto recruit golden farmers. Apart from\nthe golden legend, all farmers in the\nbase should build houses to provide\nsufficient housing for the upcoming wave\nof farmers and troops. After building\n100 houses, they can then follow orders\nto mine at various resource points.\nGolden legendary farmers are responsible\nfor cultivating and planting legendary\nquality spirit fields. Tangi led all the\nMod Dao iron guards along the northern\nroute outside Hulu Pass to kill monsters\nand hunt wild animals. He brought 50\nflower fairies along with him who could\nnot only help in the battle, but also\nimmediately occupy the resources that\nwere spawned. Five flower fairies were\nleft at each resource point to mine\nthem. Remember, if there are any areas\non the map that are not clearly marked,\nor if you are unsure what kind of\nmonster it is, have the flower fairy\nscout ahead. Pay men soldering. Leave 10\nphantom archers to guard the base and\ntake the rest of the phantom archers to\nthe south road of Calabash Pass to farm\nmonsters. Also take 50 flower fairies\nand do the same. Ba, you should stay in\nthe lord's manor and wait for me to\nreturn. Song rule, you take all the\narchers with you and follow me. This\ntime we're going to challenge the house\nof death. Chapter 60. You don't play by\nthe rules. Inside a lord's manor in the\nnewbie zone, a tall man was quietly\nbandaging a wound on his arm. Although\nhe didn't have the handsome looks of Lin\nShia and Pay Min, he still had a dashing\nappearance and an air of authority in\nhis every move. My lord, we have lost\nnearly half of our brothers in this\ndemonic tide. The sword dancers no\nlonger have the morale to continue\nfighting. The tall man pondered for a\nfew seconds, then immediately stood up.\nHuh? This is a B-level demonic tide that\nonly the most elite experts in the\nbeginner zone can encounter. We actually\nmanaged to hold on with only half of our\ntroops lost. Once people find out, who\nwouldn't give these soldiers a thumbs up\nand say, \"We are terrifyingly powerful.\"\nBut my lord, you are injured. You don't\nunderstand. I was injured while testing\na new technique. The tall man picked up\na long sword that was lying at his feet,\ntwirled it gracefully, and said, \"I am a\ngenius from Jangdong number one high\nschool, someone who is on par with Lin\nShiao. Do you think I would be injured\nby a demon? However, Lia&lt;unk&gt;s progress\nlies in the fact that practice makes\nperfect. If I don't test new skills in\nactual combat, how can these skills be\nconfirmed to be useful and usable?\" The\ntall man gently stroked his long sword,\nsighing with emotion. I don't remember\nwhere it was from, but someone once\nsaid, \"What you learn from books is\nnever enough. You must put it into\npractice to truly understand.\" I have\nlong considered him a confidant, but I\nwish I could meet him in person.\nHowever, for the sake of the future of\nthe entire Lang Shia and even all of\nhumanity, I am willing to risk my life\nfor him. What does it matter if I get\ninjured a hundred more times in order to\ntest better combat techniques? My lord,\nmy lord is truly a noble person. The\nsoldier immediately knelt on one knee,\ndeeply moved. Upon hearing the sound of\nthe man's loyalty increasing before the\ngod system, the tall man simply nodded.\nGo tell the soldiers outside the truth.\nThe world may misunderstand me, but I\ndon't want my brothers to lose heart.\nYes, my lord. Seeing the troops leave,\nthe tall man visibly breathed a sigh of\nrelief and muttered to himself. A\nB-level demonic tide is really not\nsomething that can be easily withstood,\nespecially under the circumstances\nbefore. It's all Lin Xiao's fault. He\nmade me lose face. The communication\ninterface suddenly flashed and a\nstranger initiated a communication\nrequest. The tall man hesitated for a\nmoment before answering the call. On the\nother end was an arrogant man with a\nmask on who was the same expert from the\nformal district who had spoken to Lin\nSha earlier. Dingle, a genius from Jangd\nDong number one high school who is on\npar with Lin Shiao. Are you interested\nin collaborating? He he are you the top\n100 expert lord in the Lan region. He's\na top 100 expert lord. The man on the\nother end corrected. Ding Llay narrowed\nhis eyes and his expression became\nstrange. Damn, I've met my match. The\nHouse of Death is a wilderness structure\non par with the monster treasure house\nand the castle of destruction in the\nbattlefield of the waring states. The\nhouse of death is divided into three\nlevels, each with powerful monsters and\nbosses. You can leave after completing\neach floor, but you can only get the\nrichest reward after completing all\nthree floors. Because the monsters in\nthe house of the dead are fixed, there\nis no issue of luck. Therefore, the\nhouse of death is more difficult than\nthe monster treasure house, but the\nrewards are also more generous. Most\nimportantly, the house of the dead can\nalso reward a lot of advanced resources\nsuch as fine wood, fine stone, fine\niron, and fine copper, which are needed\nto upgrade the three levels. That's\nright, Lyn Sha hasn't even reached tier\n2 yet, but he's already preparing\nresources for upgrading to tier three.\nThe Black Flame Lord's attack has always\nbeen a huge obstacle in his path. Can\ndescend from the broken zone are limited\nto a maximum of 1,000. But what kind of\ntroops will the invaders from the\nofficial zone bring? Epic or legendary?\nHow powerful will the enemy be? The\nchance of a new lord winning when the\npowerful players arrive in the main\nserver is less than one in a thousand.\nThey must be strong enough to win. But\nLynn Shia has studied all the cases. If\nthe new lord has already upgraded to\nlevel three before the powerful players\narrive in the main server, the chance of\nwinning can be increased to 5%.\nTherefore, by preparing early, if\neverything goes smoothly, I can upgrade\nto level three, recruit heroes, and gain\nmore confidence before the arrival of\nthe black flame lord. At this moment,\nLin Shia and the archers had safely\nkilled all the enemies on the first and\nsecond floors and entered the third\nfloor. The sky was filled with blood red\nvampire bats, and amidst their eerie\nhowls, a coffin on the roof of the death\ntower slowly opened. A mummy wearing a\ngolden crown and wrapped in bandages\nslowly sat up. Foolish and ignorant\nhumans, how dare you trespass into the\ntomb of my noble pharaoh Ramsy's III.\nYou disturb me. Before he could finish\nspeaking, 10 feathered arrows pierced\nthe mummy's body with a whooshing sound.\nWhy are you not playing by the rules?\nWho are you? Ramsy's III shouted\nangrily. Do we have to announce our\nnames before the battle starts? Lyn Sha\nasked, tilting his head. Of course, this\nis basic etiquette among nobles. I then\nlisten carefully. I am Stormbborn, king\nof dragon stone, the unburnt, father of\ndragons, king of marine, liberator of\nAapor, king of the undulser\nand first men, ruler of the seven\nkingdoms and protector of the realm. K\nof the Dothraki on the great plains. The\none who broke the chains. What kind of\nnobleman has so many titles? Are you\nkidding me? 10 more arrows came flying\nand the mummy teleported, barely dodging\nmost of them, but was still covered in\ndirt and grime. Huh? How ignorant. How\nridiculous. I haven't even finished\nlisting my titles yet. There's another\none with an even longer title. The Bing.\nKill him. At Lyn Xiao's command, the\narchers with divine arms drew their bows\nand fired again. In the gaps between the\npharaoh mummies dodges and weaves, it\nalso let out a long howl, and half of\nits blood red bats transformed into\nhumanoid vampires, mingling with the\nswarms of bats as they charged toward\nLinhao's group. Lyn Shiao was prepared\nfor this. He brought the divine archer\narchers specifically to counter flying\nunits. The divine archer archers were\narchery masters who could even shoot\narrows into the backs of ravens in the\nsky. And dealing with bats was no\nproblem for them either. Charge. They're\nall ranged attackers. Amidst the\nscreech, a few vampires or vampires\nfinally managed to reach the archer,\nonly to find that the ranged unit in\nfront of them was wearing thick armor\nand a cruel smile appeared in their\neyes. Then they were cleaved in two by\nthe ring pommel sword. Even the\npharaoh's mummy was ultimately unable to\nwithstand this group of monstrous ranged\nattackers and turned to ashes amidst\nincredulous staires. Ding! You have\nsuccessfully defeated all the guards in\nthe House of Death. Rewards are being\ncalculated. Hearing that the systems\nsettlement naturally included refined\nwood, refined stone, refined iron, and\nrefined copper, Lin Sha nodded with\nsatisfaction and led the archers out of\nthe house of death. I've gained a lot of\nexperience, so I can upgrade the troops\nagain soon. Next, all we need to do is\ndeal with the death knight and destroyed\ncastle, and we'll have enough materials\nto upgrade to level three. Just then,\nChuinga sent a message. Lyn Shia,\nconnect the communication immediately.\nUrgent chapter 61 past events with Dugu\nXiaolan. Lyn Sha then realized that he\nhad missed Chufinga's communication\nrequest again. There's no other reason\nthan that when using Xiao Guangi's\nspirit to fight in the dark environment,\nhe was completely focused and had no\ntime to think about communication\nrequests or other things. Lyn Shiao\nimmediately dialed Chufinger's number\nand the call was connected. On the other\nend was an arrogant young man with a\nfull head of green hair. Fungu, why has\nyour hair turned green? He wasn't this\nall the work of your former class\nmonitor. Chufinga pouted looking\nterrified. Dugu Xaolon Lin Shia asked\ncuriously. Isn't Dugu Jaolon in another\nnewbie zone? Is she going to come over\nhere and shove your head underwater?\nSigh. How am I supposed to know what she\ndid? She dyed my hair green right\nthrough the screen and I didn't even\noffend her. Chufinga poured out his\ngrievances. He I know. Dug a gel on. She\nrarely gets this angry. What did you say\nthat you shouldn't have? I I didn't say\nanything. You urgently contacted me just\nfor this? Lynn Shiao asked suspiciously.\nChufinga then realized what was\nhappening and said, \"Hey, I was so angry\nbecause of that woman Dugu that I forgot\nabout it.\" Then Chufinga brought her\nface close to the screen, looking left\nand right. Lyn Sha, where's your guster\narcher? S Rui&lt;unk&gt;'s lips twitched\nbeneath his mask. He silently walked\nbehind Lin Sha and gave a gesture of\nrespect to the screen with his hands\nclasped. So this is the Gust Archer Lin\nShia Chufinga exclaimed in amazement. He\nlooks even more imposing than my\nberserker. You're something else. Did\nyou get this unit from an epic chest?\nBefore Lynn Shiao could reply, Chufungo\nwaved her hand again. No need to tell\nme. Lyn Shao, judging from your\nexpression, I can pretty much guess\nwhat's going on. Everyone on the\nbattlefield of all races has secrets.\nThis is your trump card, so you'd better\nkeep it well hidden. Heihei, can you\ntell me what you want to see me about? I\nhave other things to do. Lynn Shiao said\nwith a faint smile. Chufunga immediately\nreplied, \"It's urgent. I came here\nbecause of your urgent matter.\" Chufunga\nchuckled and leaned back, saying, \"Lin\nXiao, I didn't expect you to be so good\nat causing trouble. I've only just come\nout after breaking through to the first\nlevel and fighting against the demonic\ntide.\" And I find out that you've killed\nthose two bullies. Well done. Well done.\nBut Lynn Shiao, do you remember when I\nmentioned their backing? I remember. I\nalso calculated that if their backers\nreally want to deal with me, my chances\nof winning might not be very high. Lyn\nShao said calmly. But we are already at\nodds, so the only option is to kill\nthem. Chufunga looked at Lin Sha in\nsilence, her green hair gleaming in the\nlight. After a moment, he said, \"I can't\nsee a trace of fear in your eyes, Lyn\nSha.\" Although Ding Lay likes to\npretend, he is right about one thing.\nThe battlefield of the myriad races is a\nbattlefield of iron and blood. I am\ndevoted to the great Dao and have no\nfear of life and death. Good, Lynsha.\nJust for those words, this old man will\ndefinitely protect you, Chufinga\nexclaimed. Old man Heihei, it's Chu\nYusi, the lord of Jangdong City.\nIt's&lt;unk&gt; him. Lyn Sha suddenly\nrealized. I knew you were extraordinary,\nbut I didn't expect you to be this\nextraordinary. The famous madman of\nJangdong is your father. Sai, let's not\ntalk about that nickname. He's a thing\nof the past, having faded from the\nbattlefield of the myriad races struggle\nfor supremacy. Chufungo waved his hand\nand said, \"However, with the power of\nthe Jangdong city lord's mansion,\nprotecting you is no problem.\" Lyn\nXiao&lt;unk&gt;s eyelids twitched when he\nheard the idiom that Chufunga uttered.\nLyn Sha, do you know that when you were\nresisting the demonic tide, my old man\ncame to me about it? They contacted you.\nLyn Sha frowned slightly. He said that\nJabbron, the first prophet under the\nqueen of dragon summer domain, has taken\nnotice of you because of the\nextraordinary magical tide. He said that\nalthough you only have F-level talent,\nyou have great potential and are worth\nfocusing on cultivating. Then my old man\nasked me to help you out a lot. Chufinga\nsaid apologetically. I didn't expect\nthat I had just turned around and made a\nbreakthrough to a higher level when you\nwiped out the enemy. Sigh. I didn't even\nget a chance to make a move. On the\nother side of the screen, Lin Sha\nappeared calm on the surface, but his\nheart was in turmoil. When did I manage\nto attract the attention of the highest\nlevels of Lia? And why was I being\nreferred to through the Jangdong city\nlord s connections? They watched\nsilently as he fought and killed Xiao\nDaang and his men. What are they trying\nto do? What do they know? Or do they\nsimply think they've triggered the\ndemonic tide through a series of\ncoincidences and that their own\npotential makes them look at them\ndifferently without any other\nintentions? What does Lord Chu want me\nto do? Lyn Sha asked calmly. Nothing\nelse, Lyn Sha. Chufinga said casually.\nWe've been brothers for years. How could\nthis old man dare to harm you? He just\nwants me to tell you to come see him.\nYou can set the time. The sooner the\nbetter. Here's his ID number, Chufinga\nsaid. Then sent Chu Yusi's number to Lin\nShia. Don't worry. This time will\ndefinitely protect you. Chufinga said\nnonchalantly. We beat up their little\nones, and now the old ones are here. We\nhave older people here, too. Why can't\nwe send in more people? Who's afraid of\nwho? Seeing Chufinga's posture and\nhearing his witty remarks, Lynn Shia\ncouldn't help but chuckle. Please thank\nLord Shu for me. I will look for him.\nLyn Sha said sincerely. Why not use the\npowerful figures around? Although he\ndidn't want to rely on them to solve\neverything. It's always good to have an\nextra layer of protection. As long as\nthe big shot won't affect me. All right,\nI almost forgot. Chufinga was happy to\nsee that Lin Shia was willing to go to\nChu Yusi, but then she remembered that\nthere was another thing. Dug Jalon\ncontacted me and gave me a bunch of\ndocuments. She said she would pass them\non to you. That's really strange. Why\ndidn't she just contact you directly?\nShe could have asked me for my ID.\nShufinga shook her head and said, \"You\noriginally promised to go find my old\nman, so it doesn't matter whether you\nneed these materials or not, but after\nall, it was the class monitor's good\nintention. I'm sending it to you now.\nPlease receive it.\" Lyn Sha looked at\nChufunga suspiciously, feeling that\nthere was something Chufunga hadn't told\nhim yet. While transferring files,\nChufinga kept muttering. Lyn Sha, I'm\nrelieved that you're doing so well in\nthe newbie zone. This time, I guarantee\nyou won't become a vassal lord by\njoining the old man. You'll remain\nindependent. Then, the two of us will\ndominate the Lnon region. Also, it's\nnormal for a grown man to have a few\nconcubines on the battlefield of 10,000\nraces. Once he returns to the Dragon Sea\nKingdom, his wife usually won't object.\nIf you object, then let's find another\none. Some people are really fierce.\nThey'll unleash their full power at the\nslightest disagreement, throwing a skill\nat your face, and they also have\npowerful backers. I don't know if you\ncan accept marrying into their family.\nBut you're an orphan, so there's nothing\nwrong with marrying into the family. All\nthe documents are sent. Hey, why does\nyour face look so dark? Lynn Shia on the\nother side of the screen had a face so\ndark it could drip ink. Chufinga, I\ndon't know how your hair was turned\ngreen by Dugu Jaon, Lyn Shia said\nexpressionlessly. But if I were Dugu\nJaon, I'm afraid I wouldn't be able to\nresist either. Huh? Just for such a\nsmall matter? Chufinga asked in\nsurprise. I thought it was because I\nasked her last time how to relieve\nmenstrual cramps. Lyn Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s eyes\nwidened. You're asking about her,\nChufinga? Yeah, I've already slept with\nall my ex-girlfriends. She's the only\none who happens to be resisting the\ndemonic tide. Who else should I ask if\nnot her? I was afraid she would beat me\nup, so I said I was Lyn Xiao's beautiful\nheroine. Lyn Shiao silently reached out\nand turned off the communication.\nChapter 62 information about the black\nflame lord. Dugu Xiaolan, the perennial\nsecond place student at Dangdong number\nthree Middle School, is also Lin Xiao's\nclass monitor. She was stunningly\nbeautiful with a cool and aloof demeanor\nand was exceptionally proud and\nindependent. Although he has a strong\nsense of pride in his conduct and\ndealings with others, he is not\narrogant. He is a prominent figure at\nJangdong number three middle school and\none of the top students. Unfortunately,\nthroughout her entire academic career,\nall her achievements were overshadowed\nby Lin Sha until the day of the Lord's\ntalent test. Lynn Shiao knew that she\nmust have awakened a considerable\ntalent. So, he was immediately taken\naway by the director and made a seed\nplayer, keeping her talent a secret.\nSpeaking of which, Dugu Jalon and Lynn\nShiao didn't have much interaction.\nAlthough they were in the same class,\none was a block head and the other was\nan ice queen. During their school life,\nthe two were always competing for first\nplace and didn't have much interaction\nwith each other. But handsome men and\nbeautiful women are popular figures at\nschool. So wouldn't some rumors and\ngossip circulate? Even Lin Sha himself\ncouldn't quite explain his feelings for\nDugu Jaolon. It's impossible to say that\nthere was something going on between the\ntwo, but over the years of competition,\nLyn Sha felt that they had some mutual\naffection. However, he knew from his\npast life that men's intuition is very\ninaccurate. Based on his experience of\nliving two lives, Lynsha also discovered\nthat Dugu Jaolon was by no means a\nsimple academic genius. From her good\nupbringing and speech, as well as the\nseemingly insignificant security\npersonnel entering and leaving the\nschool, Lyn Sha could guess with his\ntoes that she had a very strong\nbackground. At this moment, Lyn Sha\ngleaned even more information from\nChufinga's gossip. He shook his head.\nThe Dugu Jaolan he remembered wouldn't\nlose his composure so easily, getting so\nangry that he died, chewing his hair\ngreen through the screen. However, Lin\nSha couldn't help but chuckle. This\nversion of Dugu Jaolon was indeed more\nhumane. Opening the file sent by Dugu\nJaolon, Lin Shiao side slightly,\nthinking to himself, \"As expected, this\nis it. This document contains the\npersonal information of Black Flame, a\ntop player from the official server who\nis about to break through the server and\ncome to punish him, as well as\ninformation about the people behind him.\nBlack Flame, official district lord,\ngraduated from a noble school, real name\nunknown. I entered the battlefield of\nthe myriad races 3 years ago. The most\nrecent level I can find is 65. My\nheadquarters is level six, and I have\nsix heroes. Among them, the strongest\nhero is the Predator Nano, an epic level\nhero whose revealed skills are\nspeculated to be. Black Flame's troop\ntypes include Blackflame's own lord\nTalonis. Blackflame himself is cruel and\nbloodthirsty. During his time as a\nnovice lord, he entered the official\nserver as the second ranked player in\nthe new server, during which time he\nkilled at least 10 of his fellow human\nrace. After entering the official\nserver, he used the extermination token\n59 times, killing 55 lords. Last year, I\nbroke into the newbie zone and killed\nthe newbie lord. This person's past\ncompetition honors. Lynn Shiao slowly\nfinished reading the document and\ncouldn't help but admired Dugu\nJaolan&lt;unk&gt;s meticulousness and\ndedication. To be able to gather so much\ninformation in just a few hours, squad\nleader, you must have some powerful\nbacking. Lyn Sha shook his head and\ncontinued reading. Wong Su, official\ndistrict lord, lord of black flame. Rank\nand life details unknown. Note, due to\ntime constraints, please understand.\nWong Su is suspected to be a member of\nthe celestial beings organization, a\npowerful alliance formed by members of\nvarious noble schools in the Dragon Sa\nKingdom. Wong Su&lt;unk&gt;s most recent\ndisplay of strength placed him at number\n100 on the LN region's overall\nleaderboard. Note, ranks to 150 are\ncalled expert lords. Ranks 49 to 11 are\ncalled master lords. And the top 10 are\ncalled chief lords. Lynsha nodded\nsilently. So this was the masked man. He\nclaimed to be a top 100 expert lord.\nSuddenly Lyn Sha thought to himself,\n\"What does please understand Miss mean?\nWho is Miss Dugu? Jaon and there's also\nWong Su. This guy is such a vain person\nwho loves playing word games. What\nexactly are the top 100? They are the\ntop 100. How much exactly? 100 people.\nLyn Sha continued reading. Due to access\nrestrictions, very little information is\navailable for this celestial beings\norganization. Current information\nsuggests that the Celestial Beings\norganization has close ties with Japan\nand possesses a diverse arsenal due to\nits wealthy members. Its leader is\nsuspected of commanding angelic soldiers\nof legendary quality, making it a\nlegitimate force in the Dragon Summer\ndomain and one of the Dragon Queen's\nformidable potential rivals. After\nreviewing the information, Lin Sha\nsilently looked up. The information sent\nby Dugu Jaolon is very timely. With this\ninformation, I have a general idea of\nthe strength, troop composition, and\ntroop distribution of the Black Flame.\nYou have to be prepared for anything.\nI've never pinned my hopes on the\nprotection of a big shot. If the\nnegotiations fall apart, at least I can\nface the consequences on my own. Seeing\nthat it was still early, Lynn Shia\ndecided to continue grinding monsters,\naccumulating experience, and seizing\nresources. The cool down period will be\nover by tonight. So, I'll upgrade\ndirectly to tier 2. As for contacting\nChu Yusi, that will have to wait until\nnight when I have plenty of time and can\nno longer farm. As the last rays of\nsunlight set behind the mountains, Lyn\nSha led the archers with divine\ncrossbows back to his lord's manner.\nWhoosh! Whoosh! Everyone was panting.\nKill more monsters. Lynn Shiao timed his\ntime down to the second and destroyed an\nextra cobalt lair. At the last moment,\nthe archer with the divine arm, wearing\na 60- lb heavy infantry armor, ran back\nto the camp like a brown bear. Because\nLin Sha possessed the heroic spirit of\nEmperor Taong of Song, Xiao Kuangi.\nAlthough he wasn't as good as Xiang Yu,\nhis attributes were still increased by\nover a hundred, so his performance was\nstill respectable. He looked up and saw\nBaoi waiting anxiously for Lin\nXiao&lt;unk&gt;s return, her fair and delicate\nface filled with worry. \"My lord, you're\nback.\" Baoi ran happily over to Lin Xiao\nupon seeing him, ignoring the large\ngroup of muscular men around her and\nthrew herself into Lin Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s arms.\nSensing Bao's excitement and feeling her\nsoft, boneless touch, Liao&lt;unk&gt;s heart\nalso burned with passion. He held this\nstunning beauty quietly, feeling all his\nweariness vanish. Baoi, are you feeling\nall right today? Lynn Sha led Baoi to\nthe open space in front of the\nLord&lt;unk&gt;'s mansion. There, several\nfarmers had already cooked legendary\nspirit rice porridge and roasted some\nwild sheep and barbarian beef, the aroma\nof which was very enticing. My lord, Ba\nis well. Ba&lt;unk&gt;'s face was flushed. The\nfirst thing Lynn Shiao did upon\nreturning was to inquire about her\nhealth, which made her feel flattered.\nAfter chatting with Baoi for a while,\nLynn Shiao invited everyone to eat\nspirit rice porridge and roasted meat.\nDing! You have consumed legendary grade\nspirit rice, gaining plus two to body.\nThe notification from the main god\nsystem sounded, and Lin Shia nodded with\nsatisfaction. \"This spirit rice porridge\nis great. It's fragrant, sweet, and\nchewy, and it can also increase\nattributes. The muscular men sitting\naround the fire were also full of\npraise. Needless to say, they also felt\nthe improvement in their physical\nattributes. Legend has it that there's\nenough spirit rice, so I'll feed my\nfirst batch of crew members to their\nhearts content. They'll randomly gain\ntwo attribute points every day, and over\ntime, the bonus will be quite\nterrifying. At this moment, his vassal\nlord he sent him a message. Boss Lin\nShiao, that big- breasted, brainless\nwoman, Zay May, has caused trouble\nagain. Chapter 63. Tu Sha by Chian\ncauses trouble. Trouble? Can't Tan by\nChian be a little more reliable? That\nwas Lin Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s first reaction. Even\nso, Lyn Shao immediately initiated a\ncommunication with Heiz. On the other\nend, Heay scratched his head sheepishly.\nBoss Lin Shiao Ding Lay has his eye on\nthat beautiful girl. Lyn Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s\nexpression changed and he quickly asked\nfor the specific reason. As he continued\nhis rambling explanation, Lin Shiao\nfinally understood. It turns out that\nafter Tu Sha by Chin returned, she\nimmediately recruited soldiers and\nfarmers to restore production. She was\nalso extremely lucky and soon obtained a\nrare weapon, the Moon Spirit Shortsword.\nSpeaking of that pretty girl, she's\nreally lucky. She almost caught up with\nme, the chosen one of destiny. No, I\nmean the younger brother of destiny. She\nwants to learn from Lyn Xiao's methods\nand tame neutral monsters. If she can't\ntame them, she'll just fight them. After\nall, she has rare weapons. A hint of\nenvy flickered in Heay's eyes. Then she\nled two squads of troops to the\ncentaur's lair. Unfortunately, there was\nan exceptional centaur leader stationed\nthere. Terrified, the beautiful girl\nimmediately transformed into a fox\nspirit and tried to escape.\nUnexpectedly, the beautiful girl who\ncould transform into a demon beast did\nnot arouse the hostility of these\nhalfhuman half beast uh centurs. The two\nsides simply sat down and chatted for a\nbit, and then the centaur leader along\nwith his 30 rare centaur archers joined\nthe beautiful girl's side. This was\ncompletely a brainless act of\nrecklessness and had nothing to do with\nluck. Lyn Sha thought to himself. He\ncontinued, \"The beautiful girl whose\nstrength had greatly increased happily\ncalled me to show off. Then, right in\nfront of me, she mounted a centaur,\nriding off into the mortal world.\" Lyn\nSha waved his hand. \"Get to the point.\nWhat trouble did she get into?\" She\nwanted to make a name for herself and\nplanned to hunt some more powerful\nmonsters. She had just run to the\ndestroyed castle when she encountered\nDing Lays army passing by. Hearing Heay\nuse the phrase made a name for himself,\nLyn Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s eyelids twitched\ninvoluntarily again. But there were more\nimportant things to do at the moment.\nDing Lays army. Lyn Shia frowned and\nasked, \"Why do you call it an army?\"\nDingle has a full 10 squads of rare\ntroops and two squads of superior\ntroops, 120 troops. and everyone knows\nthat he is also a lord with A-level\ntalent. The beautiful girl was\nimmediately surrounded and the two sides\nwere locked in a tense standoff for\nquite a while. Dinglay realized that\ntaking her in would be too troublesome,\nso he wanted the beautiful girl to\nsurrender. The beautiful girl also\nwanted to conserve her strength. In the\nend, the two were locked in a stalemate\nfor too long and the beautiful girl was\nambushed by Ding Lay and captured. The\nmoment Ding Lay captured the beautiful\ngirl, he cut off all her communications.\nBut the beautiful girl never closed her\ncommunication with me. I switched to\nvoice communication and didn't make a\nsound. That's how I found out about all\nthis. So Tu Shawn by Chin has been\ncaptured. Lyn Sha asked. That's right,\nhe said. The pretty girl didn't have a\nchance to call boss Lyn Sha, but she\nshould know that I overheard what\nhappened. Captured, Lyn Shao pondered.\nThat's a rare sight on the battlefield\nof the myriad races vying for supremacy,\nespecially a prisoner of 50 soldiers.\nBut Zay's soldiers definitely can't beat\nDing Lay. He said anxiously. Wait a\nminute. You just said the castle was\ndestroyed. Yes, boss. The destroyer\ncastle is located in a fairly central\nlocation on the map. When did he and the\nbeautiful girl encounter it? About an\nhour ago. Lyn Shao immediately entered\nthe memory palace in his mind and began\nsearching. Then he suddenly discovered a\nproblem. An hour ago, if the beautiful\ngirl had ridden her horse at full speed,\nshe could have run back to her\nterritory. Dingle&lt;unk&gt;s rare and\nexcellent troops must be just as good.\nHe asked, puzzled. Boss Lyn Sha, what\ndoes this have to do with anything? The\nconnection is that there's no Lord's\nmanor near this destroyed castle you\nmentioned and it's already dark. Lyn Sha\nsaid in a deep voice after Tan by Chin\nand Ding Lay encountered each other.\nTheir standoff wasted time and neither\nof them could go back. That's right.\nBoss Lin Sha is right. He realized that\nthe battlefield of the myriad races at\nnight was extremely dangerous and those\ntoo, they should still be inside the\ndestroyed castle. Lyn Sha nodded.\nPerhaps Zay's situation isn't as bad as\nwe think. I'll go find Dinglay. Lyn Sha\nhung up the call and opened the chat\nchannel. At night, everyone was chatting\nidly. Dingle, this is Lyn Sha. Are you\nthere? Lyn Sha didn't waste any words\nand directly tagged Ding Lay in the\npublic channel. He he boss Lyn Shao.\nWhat can I do for you? As soon as Ding\nLay replied, the entire chat channel\nfell silent. These two are both\nprominent figures in the 89,757\nnewbie zone. One is the first hero\nrecruited in the beginner zone and the\nother is the second hero recruited in\nthe beginner zone. One is a genius from\nDjangdong number three middle school and\nthe other is a big shot from Jangdong\nnumber one middle school who is said to\nbe his equal. Moreover, the two of them\nhad an unpleasant incident during the\nday. Dinglay gifted gold coins to Gene\nDangs live stream and publicly tried to\nmediate between Lin Shia and Xiao\nDataong but failed and was retorted by\nLin Sha. The two are now suddenly\narguing online and this is happening\nright after nightfall while everyone is\nhaving dinner. Hurry up and grab a\nstool. Let's eat some melon seeds and\nwatch the show. Dingle, are you\ndestroying a castle right now? Lyn Sha\ncut to the chase and asked directly,\n\"How did you know? Are those pretty\ngirls also in your hands? Yeah, I just\ntied him up, planning to subdue him and\nmake him a vassal lord. How did you\nknow? Wow, Dinglay tied up the pretty\ngirl. No wonder she hasn't shown up in\nso long. I heard she's a white stocking\nlowly. All looks and no brains. What's\nDinglay up to? Also, how do you subdue\nit? Dinglay Zme is my vassal lord. You\ncan't subdue her. It turns out that the\nbeautiful girl has become a vassal lord\nof the powerful Lin Sha. The beautiful\ngirl has indeed joined forces with boss\nLyn Sha. And what's more, boss Lyn Sha\nalready has beautiful female heroes and\nhe's already added another member to his\nherum on just the second day. This is\ngoing to be interesting. Two big shots\nfighting over one woman. Even Heay found\nhimself inexplicably excited. And the\nflower fairy beside him handed him a\nhandful of melon seeds. Master, have\nsome melon seeds. He sure enough, Ding\nLay was silent for a moment, then slowly\nsaid, \"I see. No wonder the pretty girl\nmade a comeback so quickly. But now that\nshe's in my hands, why should I give her\nto you?\" Ding still remembers Lin\nXiao&lt;unk&gt;s attitude towards him during\nthe day. You're still destroying the\ncastle, and with your strength, you\ncan't even get past the third level. Lin\nSha said calmly. There are no monsters\non the first floor of the destruction\ncastle, but the monsters on the second\nand third floors are extremely powerful,\nbut the castle will be forcibly upgraded\nevery 4 hours, and you'll be forced to\nfight the monsters on the second floor\nat midnight. At that point, you'll only\nhave two choices. Either expend a large\nnumber of troops to finally win on the\nsecond floor, or be killed by the death\nknight on the third floor. Otherwise,\nit's either now or after clearing the\nsecond level. We risk running out and\nbeing swallowed up by the knight of the\nsupremacy. Release the beautiful girl\nand I'll let her fight alongside you.\nThen you can defeat the death knight and\nget through this night in peace. Chapter\n64. Dinglay. Watch me go in and out\nseven times. Dingle fell silent. He\nhadn't expected Lynn Shia to see through\nthe truth so quickly. That's right. He\nhas indeed kidnapped a beautiful girl,\nbut he is currently facing a dilemma of\ndestroying the castle and has no\nsolution. Although he had a large number\nof troops, including some exceptional\nunits, he felt he was still no match for\nthe death knights. The best outcome\nwould be a pirick victory. After all,\nthe destroyer castle is even more\nterrifying than the monster treasure\nhouse and the house of death, making it\nthe most difficult outdoor building in\nthe beginner area. avoid the situation\nbecause he had wasted a lot of time\nencountering a pretty girl unless you\nadd the beautiful girl's troops. The\nbeautiful girl's superior unit, the\ncentur chieftain, is up to level 20 and\ncomes with a thorn's aura, which can\ngreatly increase their chances of\nwinning. If the beautiful girl refuses\nto help, Dinglay's only option is to\nkill her and all her troops. Otherwise,\nhe was afraid that the pretty girl would\nambush him from behind while he was\nfighting the monster. Damn it, my talent\nwas weakened because of Lin Shiao.\nOtherwise, Ding Lay glanced at the\nbeautiful girl sitting dejectedly on the\nground and at the beautiful girl\nsoldiers who had been eyeing him\nmenacingly from the outside. He only\nmanaged to take down the pretty girl\nwith a sneak attack. But these soldiers\nare still loyally following her. This is\nalso why Ding Lay doesn't dare to take\naction rashly. However, if we deal with\nthe beautiful girl and her troops first,\nour losses will be even greater, and we\nwill be in a dead end in the destroyed\ncastle, we have no choice but to take\nthis gamble. Lyn Sha, on the other hand,\nhad already planned everything out. The\ncombat power of 100 rare units and 20\nexceptional units, the combat power of\nthe death knight, the existence of the\nbeautiful girl, and her unit types,\nthese are all unstable factors. Dinglay\nhad no choice but to accept his offer if\nhe wanted to get out of here alive. If\nyou were truly a top student, you should\nhave left immediately upon realizing you\ncouldn't easily win over a girl with at\nleast a B-grade talent. So, you could\nhave returned to your own territory.\nInstead of being forced into a doomed\ncastle and facing an unsolvable\nsituation, Lyn Sha thought to himself\nand shook his head. He was waiting for\nDinglays reply. Heh he lin Dinglay\nreplied from the other end. Do you think\nI wouldn't know about destroying\ncastles? A topic that will be tested\nwhen students are divided into classes\nin the second year of high school. Lyn\nSha was taken aback when Ding Lay spoke\nagain in the chat channel. Friends\nacross the region tell me, do you think\nI Ding Lay wouldn't understand this kind\nof knowledge? Everyone was taken aback.\nHuh? Showing off again. I'll show you\nwhat a medium and large cup really are.\nHe on the other end was about to jump up\nand reply when he was held tightly by\nthe flower fairy beside him. Teacher He,\nplease don't do this. Please don't do\nthis. Teacher He in the chat channel. A\nfew people still managed to jump out and\ntake sides with Ding Lay. Dinglay, the\nbig boss, definitely knows these points.\nDinglay is a top student at Daang Dong\nnumber one high school, so there's no\ndoubt he understands. He must be here to\ndo something big. Lynn Shiao, you\nunderestimate Ding Lay. He must have his\nreasons. After seeing Ding Lays speech,\nLyn Sha fell silent. Is this kid still\ntrying to save face? He Lin Sha Ding Lay\ncontinued, \"Destroying the castle is\ndangerous, but I, Ding Lay, am\ndefinitely not the weakling you imagine.\nI, Ding Lay, am on par with you, Lin\nShao, both geniuses of Jaong Province.\nEven without the help of the beautiful\nfemale soldiers, I can defeat the deaf\nknight. Do you believe me or not? Lyn\nSha frowned. He didn't reply. He felt\nDing Lay&lt;unk&gt;s current behavior was a\nbit strange. Lyn Shiao, do you\nacknowledge that we are both geniuses\nfrom Jangdong? Dinglay asked again. Lyn\nXiao&lt;unk&gt;s face was practically a huge\nquestion mark. I'm sorry, but there was\nonly one genius who could be my equal in\nschool, and that was Dugu. Jaon. Lyn\nShao remained calm and composed. He\nnever considered Ding Lay a rival, and\nhe had no idea what it meant to be on\npar with someone of equal renown. Like\nXiao Fong in the north and Mong Fu in\nthe south, Dinglay was far from that.\nEveryone was shocked. Lyn Sha had once\nagain proven them wrong. Dinglay\nremained silent, and the silence from\nthe other end of the line chilled\neveryone to the bone. Since that's the\ncase, Dinglay slowly typed a few words.\nDingle. A hero doesn't dwell on past\nglories. Things at school are completely\ndifferent from the battlefield of 10,000\nraces. On the battlefield, I was just an\nordinary lord who had awakened an F-\nlevel talent. Lyn Sha spoke up. In the\nbattlefield of all races, you are the\nsecond in the 89757\nnewb zone. It is really beyond my\nexpectations that you can rank ninth\namong the 10 newb zones in L naan this\nyear. I must admit, you are stronger\nthan I thought. Lyn Shao pondered for a\nmoment before slowly saying, \"Among all\nthe opponents I've encountered, besides\nDugu, you are second to none. You admit\nthat I am your opponent.\" Dingle\nimmediately took over. \"Yes, and I will\ndeal with you seriously.\" Harah, very\ngood, Lynsha. Those words from you are\nenough. I will show you that my name,\nDingle, will resound throughout the\nbattlefield of all races. Ding Lays\nspeech was full of doineering\nconfidence. Lyn Sha, watch closely. See\nhow I lead a beautiful girl in and out\nof the destroyed castle seven times. He\na feels like a car will is running over\nmy face. Dinglay. Now I'll lift the\ncensorship on the pretty girl and let\nher see the true strength of the genius\nfrom Jangdong number one high school.\nAfter a moment of silence, the chat\nchannel erupted in discussion again.\nDing Lays words were so powerful. H as\nexpected of a master who has been known\nas a genius for many years. It seems\nthat I was wrong to think that he was\njust a showoff. I'm a fan now. Dinglay,\nwe don't have anything planned for\ntonight. So, let's watch you solo\ndestroy castle. The attractive girl\nfinally jumped out. Boss Lyn Shia little\nsister's fine. Dingle is untied her, but\nshe's still by his side. Should I give\nher a sneak attack? Everyone, is that\nhow you ask a question? Can't&lt;unk&gt;t you\njust send a private message? Lyn Sha,\nno. He's been honest and upright with\nus, so we should be just as honest and\nupright. Dinglay well said. Lyn Sha, you\ntruly are the opponent I've chosen. The\npretty girl started commentating. Dingle\nhas reached the second level. He led his\ntroops up. Wow, he's so strong. I can't\neven see Ding Lays skills clearly. It's\nover. Everyone was shocked. the pretty\ngirl exclaimed. Dingle, he's already\nwiped out all the monsters on the second\nfloor of the castle. He's cleared the\nsecond floor. Everyone was shocked\nagain. The exclamations of Ding Lelay is\nawesome were endless. The Holy Alliance\nis awesome. Some members of the\norganization that Dingle had just\nstarted building also straightened their\nbacks and began to wave flags and shout.\nBefore everyone could catch their\nbreath, the pretty girl continued her\nbroadcast. Dinglay led his troops\nstraight to the third level. The death\nknight has appeared. My god. He\ninstantly killed one of Ding Lays elite\nunits with a single death coil. The\ndeath knight has summoned an army of the\nundead. Dinglay is surrounded. Wu. My\nlittle sister is surrounded too. A tense\natmosphere filled the air. Everyone was\nfocused on waiting for Tu Shawn. By\nChin's report, everyone knew how\nterrifying the death knight was being\nsuch a powerful monster. Can Dinglay\npull through? Dingle, are you sure you\ncan handle this? Someone asked. No\nsooner had she finished speaking than\nthe pretty girl exclaimed. Dinglay has\nbeen slashed. Dinglay is awesome. He\ndared to solo the castle of destruction.\nHe may have lost, but he's still\nglorious. He a seized the opportunity\nand made a sarcastic remark. The pretty\ngirl said, \"Ding Llay slashed the death\nknight with a backhand.\" Dinglay, what\nlevel are you? How are you going to\nfight a death knight? Run. Beautiful\ngirl. Dingle got slashed again. Everyone\nwas speechless. Just then, the main god\nsystem suddenly issued an announcement.\nDing. Player Ding Lay has created a live\nstreamer. Lyn Shia was stunned and\neveryone else was stunned. Everyone\nrushed into the live stream and\nwitnessed a scene that shocked them.\nDing Lay holding a long sword stood\namidst the mountains of corpses and seas\nof blood in the destroyed castle. His\nbody covered in blood, his eyes\nresolute. Before him stood the\nincomparably powerful yet panting death\nknight. Lyn Shiao keenly noticed the\nflickering light on Ding Lays body and\nthe slight trembling of his hands and\nfeet. Dinglay stood tall and spoke\nslowly. Death Knight, Earth Dog, Waji\nyears. At this moment, Ding Lay seemed\nto represent an indomitable spirit.\nThere was a moment of silence in the\nlive stream. Then it exploded wildly. So\ncool. Absolutely so cool. Ding Lay is\nawesome. Amidst a chorus of praise, Ding\nLay, his body shimmering with starlight,\nleaped up and cleaved the death knight\nin two with a single strike. Amidst the\nblood red sky, the wounded Ding Lay\nstood leaning on his long sword. He\nslowly turned his head and coldly looked\nat the live broadcast room. So cool.\nAwesome. 666.\nIs this guy still putting on airs?\nAmidst a barrage of comments, Lyn Sha\nslowly opened his mouth. It's a clay\nchicken and a clay dog, not a clay dog,\nand an excavator. Puff. Dingle, who was\nposing for a moment, coughed up a\nmouthful of blood and swayed. Chapter\n65. Another upgrade. Sudden changes. In\nfront of everyone in the live broadcast\nroom, Ding Lay, who had killed the death\nknight, released Tu Sha by Chian and led\nhis remaining troops and Tu Sha by\nChians army to set up camp and rest at a\nsafe distance. The castle of destruction\nis safe tonight, and Ding Lay and Tu\nShawn by Chen did not fight. This guy\nreally enjoys showing off, but he\nwouldn't break a promise in front of\ntens of thousands of people. Seeing that\nthe situation was settled, Lyn Sha\nquietly withdrew from the live stream\namidst the sickopantic comments from the\naudience. He immediately called Lynsha.\nBrother Lynsha, it seems that Ding Lay\nis quite capable. He on the other end\nstill looked indignant and unconvinced.\nHe was originally a master with A-level\ntalent. Lyn Sha said, \"He certainly has\nthe strength, but I think I'm still far\nfrom being as good as Lin Sha.\" Heay\ncontinued. Ding Lelay destroyed the\ncastle, losing at least half of his\ntroops. Heay glanced at Lin Shia\ndiscreetly, noticing his expressionless\nand indifferent look, and said, \"I\nsuspect that if Lin Sha wanted to clear\nthe castle of destruction, he wouldn't\nhave lost so many troops.\" \"Yes, that's\nright.\" Lyn Sha didn't give a direct\nanswer, but simply said, \"It's not that\nhard to clear a place like that. You can\njust skip it along the way.\" Eay thought\nto himself. Just as I thought, I've\nchosen the right person to follow. He\noriginally thought that Lin Sha might\nadmit it was a bit difficult, perhaps by\ngiving a smaller number of casualties,\nbut he didn't expect Lin Sha to just say\nthat he could just grind it along the\nway. What makes a master? This is a true\nmaster. Considering that Lyn Sha wasn't\nlike Ding Lelay, who liked to boast, he\nwas certain that if Lin Sha said he\nwould just swipe there on the way, then\nhe really meant it. Overjoyed, Heay\nimmediately added, \"By the way, boss Lyn\nSha, I got three recruitment tokens this\ntime. One of excellent quality and two\nof common quality.\" Brother Lin Sha, I\nused my superior grade recruitment\ntoken. Can I have your ordinary grade\nrecruitment token instead? Can Lyn Sha\nwas a little curious since he hadn't\neven gotten a recruitment token yet\nwhile he already had three. It's\nimportant to know that recruitment\ntokens are extremely sought after in the\nnewbie zone. Everyone is scrambling for\nthem and everyone uses them as soon as\nthey get one. It's practically\nimpossible for anyone to sell them. This\nis because you can only build a barracks\nafter reaching tier 2. And before that,\nmost people can only replenish their\ntroops by using recruitment tokens. Lyn\nSha also invested first, giving a few of\nhis subordinates recruitment tokens\nbefore he could reap the rewards. You're\npretty lucky you've got three\nrecruitment tokens so quickly. He Heay\nscratched his head sheepishly and said,\n\"I always thought I was the chosen one.\"\nLyn Sha was speechless. He waved his\nhand, ending the conversation. He\nimmediately initiated the transaction\nand sent over two recruitment tokens.\nLyn Shia held the recruitment token, but\nonly to use it to summon Chinese troops\nwith the Huasha summoning skill. So, the\nquality of the troops was not important\nto him. Quantity was the key. As long as\nthere are enough troops and the power of\nChina, he can recruit soldiers at will.\nHe still has an epic recruitment token\nthat he hasn't used yet. I spent the\nwhole afternoon grinding and accumulated\nquite a bit of experience. To prevent\nany unforeseen circumstances, let's\ncontinue upgrading the troops. Night\nfell at the camp and all their heroes\npay men and ba and their troops returned\nunharmed. It brought Lin Sha a wealth of\nexperience and resources. Lyn Sha waved\nhis hand and upgraded. Paymen leveled up\nto level 12. The MO Dao iron guards and\nthe divine arm archers were all upgraded\nto level 11. All phantom shooters are\nlevel 16. Thank you, Lord. Amidst the\ncrowd's gratitude, Lyn Sha nodded and Tu\nShawn by Chin's communication came\nthrough. Boss Lynn shout. Over there, a\ncute little girl dressed in a white\nLolita dress, wearing white animal ears\nand white stockings, leaned against one\nend of the destroyed castle, wearily\nlooking around amidst the surrounding\nsoldiers. Tu Shan by Chian, how are\nthings on your end? Lyn Sha asked\ncalmly, his voice bringing strength to\nTu Sha by Chian. Boss Lin Sha Dinglay is\nstill a trustworthy guy. He's resting\nwith his troops on the other side. Tu\nShan by Chin whispered. He was really\namazing just now. He's so strong. I feel\nlike he could have taken on me and these\n50 soldiers all by himself without his\ntroops. What should I do? I'm so scared.\nDon't worry. Dinglay made a promise in\nfront of tens of thousands of people,\nand he won't easily go back on his word.\nBe on your guard tonight, and I'll keep\nyou safe. Tu Shan Bai Chin breathed a\nsigh of relief, patted her towering\nchest with lingering fear and said, \"By\nthe way, brother Lyn Sha, I also have a\nrecruitment token here. I'll send it to\nyou.\" \"All right.\" Lyn Sha accepted Tu\nShan by Chin's recruitment token without\nfurther ado. \"You're lucky,\" Lyn Sha\ncasually asked. He That's because she's\na woman of destiny. \"Brother Lyn Sha,\nwhat did you mean by correcting Ding Lay\nwith those four words at the end?\" Tu\nShan Bachin asked changing the subject.\nIt's an idiom. A clay chicken and a\ntiled dog. So Ding lay misspoke. Idioms.\nThey sound impressive. I've never heard\nof them before, but they feel somewhat\nfamiliar. Tu Shawn by Chin thought for a\nmoment, then gave up, realizing her\nbrain couldn't process them. Boss, I'm\ngoing to take a break. You should get\nsome rest, too. Um, the pretty girl\ndoesn't know what idioms are. This\nthought suddenly flashed through\nLinhao&lt;unk&gt;s mind. How could that be?\nLin Shiao was about to make a call to\nChu Funga to ask. The main god system\nnotified him again that an email had\nbeen sent. It was Chun Ningming, this\ntacetern kid who sent over a regular\nrecruitment token. Chun Ningming is\nquite fast, too. My luck seems pretty\ngood. Lynn Shia rubbed his temples. It\nseems like I'm the only one who's been\nhaving bad luck lately. No, it should\nbe. Why are all the underlings I recruit\nso lucky? I was lucky enough to get some\ngood gear recently. Baoi came to Lin\nXiao's side and draped a cloak over his\nshoulders. My lord, the night is growing\ncold. Please take care of yourself.\nFeeling the gentle care of the beautiful\nwoman beside him, Lynn Shiao gradually\nrelaxed. Okay, you can go ahead and get\nbusy. Arriving at the battlefield of all\nraces, he discovered some things he\nhadn't noticed before. intricate and\ncomplex with countless threads. He\ntalked about his own talents, his\nChinese imperial edict, ba idioms, and\nthe strange phrases occasionally uttered\nby people in the chat channel. I never\nthought of these things when I was on\nEarth. He he don't think too much about\nit. Funu also asked me to contact Chu\nYusi, the city lord of Jangdong. It's\nnight now and the battlefield of the\nmyriad races has basically subsided.\nIt's a good time to go find him. Lynn\nSha opened the communication interface\nand entered Chu Yusi's ID number one by\none. Suddenly, he felt a cool breeze\nblow past him, lifting his cloak. Lyn\nShao turned around but saw nothing. The\nMod Dao iron guard stood guard behind\nhim. The divine arm archers patrolled in\nthe distance. Pay Min was sitting with\nSaldin chatting and boasting. And even\nBaoi must have just entered the Lord's\nmansion. And it was unclear what she was\nbusy with. Lyn Shao entered the number\nChu Yui had given him again. Another\ngust of cold wind blew by the moment Lin\nShao pressed the communication button. A\nthunderous boom erupted in Lin\nXiao&lt;unk&gt;s mind and countless images\nflashed and replayed before his eyes. He\nsaw everything that happened after he\nentered the battlefield. He saw the\ndemonic tide and the two succubi that\nemerged from behind it. He saw one of\nthe succubi making eye contact with him.\nThen everything went black and I drifted\nto an unknown place. Chapter 66. Did the\nancient demon mistake someone? In that\ninstant, Lyn Sha drifted to an unknown\nplace. Strangely, Lyn Sha felt that\nalthough this place was unfamiliar, it\nwas also somewhat familiar. Ba's voice\nechoed in his mind. It looked ethereal\nand indistinct with no clear east, west,\nsouth, or north. There were no sun,\nmany people dressed in black. They were\ndressed in black and shrouded in black\nmist. Lyn Shao gradually regained\nconsciousness and slowly came to his\nsenses. He originally intended to call\nChu Yusi, the lord of Jangdong city. But\nthe moment he pressed the call button,\nhe found himself in this mysterious\nplace, the abode of ancient demons. Lyn\nSha slowly examined himself and\ndiscovered that he was currently just a\nmass of consciousness. Although he had a\nphysical form, he could not move and was\nsimply floating slowly. I reckon my body\nis still standing in front of my lord's\nmanor right now. What a brilliant\ntactic, Lynn Sha muttered to himself. I\nwas actually dragged to the dwelling\nplace of ancient demons. What do they\nwant to do? Before him lay a jumble of\nbuildings, both real and elucory, a\nchaotic sky, a shattered earth, and\ngusts of cold wind blowing through the\nfragmented air. Chaotic, dilapitated,\nsecluded, and strange. That was Lin\nXiao's first impression of this place.\nBetween the overlapping real and elucory\nbuildings, some figures like black mist\ndrifted about just as Lyn Sha was\nobserving. Three figures dressed\nentirely in black slowly floated over.\nThe three black figures were shrouded in\nblack mist, revealing only a pair of\ninhuman eyes that emitted an eerie glow.\nA black sky and earth, a broken and\noverlapping space, an endless black fog,\nand eerie figures drifting by. He he. An\neerie laugh rang out. The shadowy\nfigures were all taken aback. Second\nbrother, you laughed first again. It\nwasn't me. Third brother, is that you? I\nthought it was the boss laughing.\nSuddenly, all three dark figures turned\nto look at Lyn Sha, who was floating\nahead. Lyn Sha awkwardly touched his\nnose. Sorry. Seeing this opening made me\nwant to have a laugh with everyone. The\ndark figures opposite him contracted\nsharply at the same time. Although they\nhad no expression, Lin Shiao still felt\na trace of embarrassment coming from\nthem. The two remained silent. Cough,\ncough. It seemed that Lyn Xiao's\npreemptive judgment had ruined the\natmosphere created by the shadowy\nfigures. So, the shadowy figure known as\nthe leader had no choice but to\nforcefully break the silence. Do you\nknow who we are? Ancient demons, Lynsha\nsaid calmly. Aren't you afraid of us?\nLyn Sha glanced around. I'm more curious\nabout why you've brought me here since\nI'm completely defenseless right now.\nYou could easily have dragged me into\nthis place. If you wanted to harm me,\nyou could have done so at any time. The\nleader of the shadowy figures nodded, a\nvery calm judgment. The second shadowy\nfigure, and he's very bold. Lyn Sha knew\nthat he was still bothered by his\nstrange laughter earlier, so he remained\nsilent and waited to see what would\nhappen. The third shadowy figure said,\n\"We've come to you to tell you a crucial\nancient secret.\" Lyn Shaol, can I not\nlisten? The third shadowy figure asked\nin surprise, \"Why?\" \"Because I know that\nsecrets mean trouble, especially the\nsecrets of ancient demons, and I don't\nwant to get into trouble.\" The third\nshadowy figure and the other two\nexchanged a glance, looking somewhat at\na loss. The shadowy leader, \"You're very\nshrewd.\" the second shadowy figure. But\nyou're not shrewd enough. Have you\nforgotten how you came to this world?\nLynho's thoughts slowly settled down.\nThese ancient demons knew how they came\nto be, and their innermost speculations\ngradually became reality. He raised his\nhead and stared straight at the dark\nfigures opposite him, trying to discern\nsomething from their eyes. But the\npeople on the other side were all\nshrouded in black mist, indistinct, and\ntheir expressions were impossible to\ndiscern. Seeing Lynn Shiao engrossed,\nthe leader of the shadowy figures spoke\nagain. I think we should build more\ntrust in each other. You must have\nthought about a lot of things and have\nmany questions to ask. Let me tell you a\nsecret first and you'll know that we're\nnot enemies. Your token was given to you\nby us. Okay, if you have any other\nquestions, feel free to ask. Lyn Sha\nthought to himself. Just as I thought.\nHe accidentally touched a Chinese token\non Earth and was transported to this\nworld to live in the body of a\nsix-year-old orphan with the same name.\nIt turns out that this was the work of\nthese ancient demons. Who are they? What\ndo they want? Who are you? Lyn Sha asked\nthe question that concerned him most. He\nWe are from ancient times. He was\nslapped across the face by the leader of\nthe shadowy figures interrupting him.\nThe leader of the shadowy figures. You\nwant to know who we really are? We are\nChinese. The third shadowy figure's\nvoice was filled with size. Chinese?\nWait, he's Chinese? Not from Liao? A\nChinese from Earth in Lin Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s\nprevious life. Fellow villager? Lyn\nShiao asked in surprise. Fellow\nvillager, I'm not from the same village.\nThe leader of the shadowy figures shook\nhis head. The second shadowy figure\nsaid, you're way too familiar with\nyourself. You've only known us ancient\ndemons for a short time, yet you're\nalready calling us so intimately. You're\nshameless, Lynn Shiao. You're not from\nEarth, the shadowy figure asked. And\nwhat is this earth? Lynn Shiao. The\ncountry on Earth is called Hasha, and\nthe country on blue star is called Lia.\nYou two didn't travel from another time.\nThe shadowy figure asked, \"What do you\nmean by time travel?\" The atmosphere\nbetween the two sides fell into an\nawkward silence once again. They ran\ntowards each other, but when they got to\neach other, they realized they had\nmistaken one for the other. Or I raised\na lion, let it grow up, and then\nreleased it back into the wild. Years\nlater, I ran into it by chance and\nrealized I'd mistaken it for a lion.\nAhem Lyn Sha, aren't you Chinese? The\nleader of the shadowy figures broke the\nawkward silence once again. Of course,\nI'm Chinese, but you Chinese people\ndon't even know about Earth. Lyn Sha\nnarrowed his eyes. This is too\nsuspicious. You're fake Chinese. The\nthree dark figures looked at each other\nand for a moment they also showed a hint\nof weariness towards Lin Sha. The second\nshadowy figure said, \"You don't look\nChinese either. We've never heard of the\nwords you're using.\" The third shadowy\nfigure. Exactly. This kid might be a\ntraitor's creation to lure us in. He's a\nfake Chinese brother. The traitors might\nhave discovered our hiding place. The\nshadowy figure suddenly became very\nnervous. For a moment, tensions rose\nbetween the two sides, and the\natmosphere became extremely tense. After\na moment of silence, the leader of the\nshadowy figures slowly raised his hand\nand said, \"Even if they are traitors,\nthey don't need to use such methods to\nlure us in.\" Using a rookie, \"Lynshia,\nare you being polite?\" The leader of the\nshadows said, \"How about this? We might\nhave misunderstood each other. We can\nexchange secret signals to confirm if we\nare the same kind of people. Upon\nhearing the words code, Lynhia's\nexpression became serious yet somewhat\nexpectant. There are secret codes like\nthe kind in time travel novels. I never\nexpected to encounter this kind of\nscenario myself. It is truly a godsend\nfor online novel readers. I've memorized\ncountless codes just waiting for this\nday. Lynn Shia, I'll go first. Odd\nchanges even stays the same. Three dark\nfigures. What the hell? Chapter 67. The\nmost powerful code. The code that Lin\nSha blurted out stopped in midair. If\nodd changes and even remains the same,\nit won't connect. The shadowy figures\nbehavior was completely unexpected. This\nmade the atmosphere between the two\nsides even more tense. The leader of the\nshadowy figures remained silent for a\nmoment, then slowly said, \"My turn,\nstranger. If you can't answer the code,\nyou're not the one we're looking for. No\nmatter who you are, whether you are a\nspy trained by a traitor or an innocent\nperson who has strayed here by mistake,\nyou must die to ensure the survival of\nour people and to keep our secrets. The\nthird shadowy figure. Luckily, I didn't\nreveal the secret. Second brother, shut\nup. Lyn Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s brain was also\nworking at lightning speed. Could it\nreally be a misunderstanding? Were the\nancient demons not of Chinese descent?\nAt this moment, he was dragged here by\nthe shadows, which are the ancient\ndemons, and he was left with only his\nconsciousness unable to move. If the\nancient demons wanted to kill him, it\nwould be as easy as turning their hands\nat that time. Will my body turn into a\nvegetable during the battle for\nsupremacy among all races? Poor Baoi\nhadn't even had a chance to enjoy her\nhealthy, youthful body. Lyn Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s\nthoughts were still racing when the\nleader of the shadowy figures slowly\nspoke. The bright moonlight shines\nbefore my bed. What? Lin Xiao slowly\nleaned back, an expression of disbelief\non his face. That's it. Seeing Lyn\nXiao&lt;unk&gt;s actions, the leader of the\nshadowy figures opposite assumed he\ncouldn't answer and raised his hands\nwith lightning flickering amidst the\nswirling black mist. \"Is it frost on the\nground?\" Lyn Sha said slowly. The leader\nof the shadowy figures suddenly lowered\nhis hands, puzzled, and said, \"You are\nindeed Chinese, but why don't we\nunderstand what you're saying?\" They\nactually used such childish poetry as a\ncode. In an instant, a guest flashed\nthrough Lin Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s mind like\nlightning. He fired off a barrage of\nquestions. Imperial jade liquor. The\nthird shadowy figure shook his head.\nNever drunk it. 30 years east of the\nriver, 30 years west of the river. The\nsecond shadowy figure. Hey, that has a\ncertain artistic conception. Is it from\nWu Jingz? The scholars revitalized the\nNorthwest. The leader of the shadowy\nfigures said, \"This is how China should\nbe. We should not abandon our beautiful\nland.\" Lyn Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s guest gradually\ntook shape, and his expression became\nplayful. It's&lt;unk&gt; almost certain. A few\nmore code words. Lyn Sha, holding the\nsun and moon in my hands, plucking stars\nfrom the sky. The leader of the shadowy\nfigures. This poem is quite good with a\nvery impressive momentum. Lynn Shiao\ncontinued. Watch closely. This slash is\ngoing to be really cool. The second\nshadowy figure. What nonsense are you\nspouting? You're an ideologist. How\ncould you possibly have a knife? Lyn Sha\nunleashed his ultimate move. Rise again,\nmy love. The three figures in black were\nall stunned and then they felt an\nextremely absurd and indescribable\nsensation rush from the soles of their\nfeet to the top of their heads. They all\nshivered then bent over and began to\ngag. What kind of code is this? It's so\nunsettling. Sure enough, even the\nancients couldn't withstand the power of\nthis certain da thinking to himself, Lyn\nXiao's guess has been confirmed. So, you\nare the ancient Chinese? The leader of\nthe shadowy figures finally caught his\nbreath and said weakly, still shaken,\n\"If you say we are ancient Chinese,\nthat's not wrong. After all, it's been\nmore than 5,000 years, and China has\nlong become an outdated name. You've\nasked us for so many secret codes in one\ngo, and even something as cruel as this\nlover. We need to ask you a few more\nsecret codes, too.\" Lynn Sha nodded as\nyou see fit. Hearing Lynn Sha use an\nidiom, the leader of the shadowy\nfigure's eyes lit up, seemingly somewhat\npleased. He slowly asked, \"The country\nmay be broken, but the mountains and\nrivers remain.\" Lyn Sha, in spring, the\ncity is overgrown with weeds and trees.\nThe leader of the shadowy figures nodded\nwith satisfaction, and the second in\ncommand continued, \"He can draw his bow\nas full as the moon.\" Lyn Sha, looking\nnorthwest, I shoot the heavenly wolf.\nThe third shadowy figure, an ancient\nroad, a west wind, and a lean horse. Lyn\nSha, the sun sets in the west. A\nheartbroken traveler is at the ends of\nthe earth. After the three lines of Tang\npoetry, song lyrics, and Yuan opera were\nused as coded messages, the three dark\nfigures all breathed a sigh of relief.\nSecond and third brothers, that should\nbe right. These are our fellow Chinese.\nAfter the war of betrayal more than\n5,000 years ago, it would be wishful\nthinking for foreigners to memorize so\nmany poems. The leader of the shadowy\nfigures said with a hint of excitement.\nBrother, this is just junior high school\npoetry. Anyone from my country could\nanswer it. You're making it sound like\nsome kind of martial arts secret. Lyn\nSha thought to himself. The second\nshadowy figure nodded repeatedly. That's\nright. Even among the people of Long\nShia, no one can remember a war of\ntraitors more than 5,000 years ago. Have\nthe dragon Xiao people forgotten the\nChinese people? Lyn Sha felt confused\nagain. This didn't match history, so he\nquickly asked a question. Lyn Sha, wait,\nwho was the last emperor of China? The\nthird shadowy figure sneered. If the\nEizenjoro clan can be considered\nemperors of China, then the last emperor\nwas Eizenjoro Zikian. Zaition, not Pi. I\ndon't know him. Where was Empress\nDaertishi? Of course, she died of old\nage. After that, old hag died. Zaitian\nreturned to the court and took power\nuntil the arrival of the god system. Did\nEmpress Daajer Sishi not poison Emperor\nGuanchu? Did Guanu return to court? And\nalso the main god system descends. Wait,\nare you Chinese from blue star? Lynsha\nasked back. Otherwise, what? The third\nshadowy figure asked curiously. Are\nthere other Chinese? Looks like I've\nencountered a parallel universe. That\nexplains everything. Lynn Shia muttered\nto himself. No wonder you don't know\nmodern memes, but are so familiar with\nChinese history. The leader of the\nshadowy figures, however, keenly\nunderstood Linhao&lt;unk&gt;s meaning. You\nmean you're a Chinese from another\nplace? That's right. Lynsha nodded and\nsaid, \"I am a Chinese from Earth. I am a\nChinese from another planet, but my\nhistory is basically the same as yours.\"\nThe three dark figures exchanged a\nglance, and the third one whispered, \"It\nseems we've lost the Hasha token a bit\ntoo far.\" The leader of the shadowy\nfigures raised his head and looked at\nLin Sha quietly, while Lin Sha looked at\nhim quietly in return. A moment later,\nthe shadowy elder said, \"It's all right.\nI felt the same blood flowing in his\nveins.\" Lyn Sha nodded. \"I can also feel\nyour Chinese bloodline. We are all\nChinese.\" After this exchange, the two\nparted ways and formally confirmed each\nother's identities. \"Now, do you want to\nhear our secret?\" The leader of the\nshadowy figures said with a smile, \"It's\nno use if you don't listen because you\nare Chinese and you are ultimately on\nour side.\" Lyn Sha nodded. I'd like to\nhear the details. With a wave of his\nhand, the leader of the shadowy figures\nvanished instantly along with three\nother figures. An endless sea of lava.\nFiery lava spewed forth. Boiling steam\nfilled the air, and a narrow,\ntreacherous path stretched from the\ndepths of darkness all the way to the\ncenter of the sea of lava. There is a\nsmall island there. This small island\nstands alone amidst the lava, like a\ntiny, fragile boat on the waves. A\nstunningly beautiful succubus lay\nlistlessly on a large bed in the palace\nat the center of the island. Beside her\nwas an equally beautiful succubus who\nwas peeling grapes one by one with her\ndelicate hands and feeding them to her.\nThings are starting to get interesting.\nThe succubus swallowed the grape, tilted\nher long neck back and stretched.\nMaster, has that man already met with\nthe ancient demon? The magical mark I\nleft has been activated. The ancient\ndemon has already met him. The succubus\nlying on the bed was elegantly relaxed\nand simply said, \"How impatient master,\nwhat race are the ancient demons? From\nwhat I observe, they are no different\nfrom humans. So why are they called\nancient demons? Eh, they were indeed a\ngroup of humans, or at least they used\nto be. They once dominated all the\nheavens and myriad realms. Even we were\nonce subjugated and trembled at their\nfeet. Then they were betrayed by\nhumanity. Betrayed by the very people\nthey were protecting, utterly destroyed.\nEven history was erased and names became\ntaboo just like us. Chapter 68. The\ntraitor's historical shielding plan.\nLynn Shiao and the three shadowy figures\narrived at the elucory buildings and\npavilions and entered a magnificent\noverlapping hall. Please sit down, you\nChinese from another world. The shadowy\nleader and Lynn Shiao took their seats\nand began to slowly recount the story of\nthe Chinese people in this world. It\nturns out that the Chinese civilization\non Earth and the Chinese civilization on\nblue planet are no different. They both\nstarted with the three sovereigns and\nfive emperors and both had Chin Sher\nHuang, Emperor Wu of Han, Emperor Taong\nof Tang and Emperor Taizu of Song. Even\ntheir experiences were the same.\nHowever, during theQing dynasty, Emperor\nGuangshu was not poisoned by Empress\nDaajard Sishi for some reason, but\ninstead regained power after her death.\nThen, less than 10 years later, the main\ngod system arrived. On that day, the\nentire planet Earth seemed to plummet\ninto the heavens, rising higher and\nhigher until it plunged headlong into a\ndifferent universe. Then all the nations\nand all the humans on the entire planet\nEarth who had awakened the Lord's talent\njoined this endless battle that had been\ngoing on for countless millennia. As\nthey continuously entered the\nbattlefield of all races and fought\nagainst alien races and peoples, the\nworld order was constantly changing.\nGradually, those countries that were\nalready powerful and those with real\nabilities became outstanding. Taking\nthis opportunity, China also broke free\nfrom the poverty and weakness of the\nlateqing dynasty, shook off the\nEisenjoro clan and established itself as\nthe Chinese nation with a completely new\norganizational form of the battlefield\nof all races. Finally, a human alliance\nwas formed on Earth, led by many\npowerful nations such as China, Japan,\nKorea, India, Nanua, the British Empire,\nthe Holy Roman Empire, Russia, the\nUnited States, and the Arab world.\nTogether, they fought for supremacy\nagainst other races and species from all\nover the world in the battlefield of the\nmyriad races. The human race of Blue\nStar entered the battlefield of all\nraces more than 7,000 years ago. Lynn\nSha nodded. As an Earthling, he easily\nand quickly accepted the explanation\nfrom the shadowy fellow villager. After\nencountering the god system, this world\non Earth not only failed to develop\ntechnology, but its technology even\nregressed because the rules of magic\naltered certain physical rules.\nTechnology could no longer work.\nInstead, powerful lordly talents and\nsupernatural powers run rampant. The\nhuman race of Blue Star has been\ninvolved in the battlefield of the\nmyriad races for more than 7,000 years.\nLynn Sha asked curiously, \"Then why is\nthe human race still in the ninth\nheaven?\" Of the myriad races, has nine\nheavens. Unlike Earth, the ninth heaven\nhere is the most basic and introductory\nlevel. He, the leader of the shadowy\nfigures, laughed, a laugh that was both\nweary and helpless. The second and third\nshadowy figures clenched their fists\nwhile the other looked up at the\nceiling. \"This is the secret we're going\nto tell you.\" \"Blue star once swept\nthrough everything and stormed into the\nthird level of the battlefield of the\nmyriad races,\" the leader of the shadowy\nfigures said in a deep voice. \"And the\nmain force of blue star at that time was\nnone other than us, the Chinese\nmilitary.\" \"What? Chinese military units\nonce existed in this world? China once\nled the entire planet to dominate the\nbattlefield of myriad races and even\nbroke into the third heaven. Lynn Sha\nfrowned and said, \"Is the current\nsituation caused by the traitors you\nmentioned before?\" The leader of the\nshadowy figure's side exactly. We\nChinese are born hardworking and brave\nand we are also influenced by the\nConfucianism of self-improvement. Even\nwhen theQing dynasty was temporarily\nruled by the manshes such as Eisenjoro\nwhich led to the decline of our national\nstrength and being bullied by other\ncountries, we quickly turned against\nthem after entering the battlefield of\nall races. And we Chinese in less than\n200 years have become the most powerful\nrace on earth in the battle for\nsupremacy among all races. The leader of\nthe shadowy figures stood with his hands\nbehind his back, his head slightly\ntilted back as if reminiscing or longing\nfor that era. For the next 2,000 years,\nwe Chinese led the human race of Blue\nStar to conquer all directions. We\nsoared straight to the seventh heaven.\nThe second shadowy figure continued,\n\"Haha, punching orcs, kicking undead. A\nglare from him and goblins and gnomes\ncower in terror. A roar and giants and\ntrolls lose their minds. Colonial dark\nelf girls, domesticated vampire noble\nwomen, exploited forest witches.\nMermaids come to massage our feet with\nthe flick of a finger. Angels are merely\nour servants guarding our homes, and\ndevils are simply our protectors in our\nconquests. The capital of women of all\nrealms and races. Before the second in\ncommand could say anything more, the\neldest slapped him across the face\nagain. Shut up. You're making us sound\nlike some ancient demon. The third\nshadowy figure said, \"But second brother\nis right, eldest brother. You also have\nquite a few private photos of dark elf\nladies. Get lost.\" The leader of the\nshadowy figures kicked the third brother\nhundreds of meters away. He paused for a\nmoment, then slowly brushed off\nimaginary dust from his body and\nregained his composure, saying, \"As you\nknow, the Chinese are a peaceloving\nnation. They're definitely not as evil\nas those two guys make them out to be.\nIn short, you'll know that the Chinese\npeople in just 2,000 years led the\nentire human race into the third level\nof the battlefield of the myriad races\nvying for supremacy. Humanity has become\na shining new star on the battlefield of\nall races. The shadowy figure paused\nagain, then said, \"Until that war of\ntraitors 5,000 years ago. That year, we\nwere preparing for a great war with the\nprotos in the third heaven.\" Right then,\nthe shadowy figure became agitated. The\nJapanese, Korean, British, and other\nnations on Earth have suddenly joined\nforces to betray us, betray humanity.\nThey launched a sneak attack on China\nfrom behind. They sold our intelligence\nto alien races and on several\nbattlefields they joined forces with\nalien races to capture China's\nstrongholds. Chinese warriors\ncounterattack immediately. The earth\nshook and the stars shifted as the sun\nset. This battle lasted for a full 10\nyears. But the Chinese nation never\nexpected to be betrayed by its own human\ncompatriots and ultimately suffered a\ncrushing defeat. At the last moment, the\ngreat powers of China used their might\nto open a space-time rift, leading the\nremnants of their army into it. But\nthose traders still refuse to give up.\nThey want to completely annihilate US\nand destroy China. China still has\ncountless citizens, and China once\ndominated the world for nearly 2,000\nyears. How easy is it to destroy China?\nAt worst, the entire nation of China\nwill fight to the death, and everything\nwill perish. Therefore, the traders used\nthe promise of not hunting down the\nChinese warriors who were hiding in all\nthe heavens and myriad worlds as a\nbargaining chip to carry out a\n5,000-year long historical erasure of\nthe Chinese nation. The leader of the\nshadowy figures said sadly, \"And you've\nseen the result,\" Lyn Sha suddenly\nrealized. \"No wonder he felt something\nwas off after arriving at the\nbattlefield of the myriad races in the\nDragon Sea Kingdom. No one studies\nhistory, but no one objects as if it's\nperfectly normal. Even he, who had lived\ntwo lives, did not feel anything\nstrange. It was only when he arrived at\nthe battlefield of the myriad races and\nwas freed from his constraints that\nthese unusual things kept echoing in his\nmind and aroused his vigilance. The\nentire Lia Kingdom has been shielded by\ntop experts from the traitorous nations\nwho have jointly set up a barrier to\nerase the history passed down through\nthousands of years of Chinese\ncivilization. The leader of the shadowy\nfigures seemed to know what Lin Sha was\nthinking. And he slowly said, \"Schools\ndon't teach history. Family genealogies\nand county chronicles are all\nconfiscated and destroyed in a fire.\nThere are no oracle bone inscriptions,\nno Tang or song poetry, no Chinese myths\nor legends, no mythical creatures from\nthe mountains and seas. The people of\nLia only know Jesus and God, but they\ndon't know kuau chasing the sun. No\nemperors or generals, no idioms or\nillusions, no famous works to be passed\ndown. Even the entire land of China has\nbeen renamed Dragon Sa. The military\nunits of Dragon Sa have all become\nwesternstyle troops, even western\nmonsters. Everything rever the west.\nEveryone bows down to western and\nJapanese culture. The leader of the\nshadowy figures said with great\ndistress, this is the current state of\nLangia. Within a few hundred years, the\noriginal inhabitants of Langia will be\ncompletely colonized just like the\nsudras and outcasts of the Indian tribe\ndue to the loss of their culture.\nChapter 69. Baoi could do whatever she\nwanted. Lyn Sha listened quietly.\nAlthough he wasn't a Chinese person from\nthis world, he and the shadowy figure\ncould feel a connection. The traitors\nhave a grand scheme to go to the point\nof destroying the most powerful nation\non Earth. They have been implementing a\ncultural shielding and cultural invasion\nplan for thousands of years. But when I\nwas fighting against Jiao Daong and the\nothers, didn't they also say trust me or\ntrust Chin Shir Huang? Dingle, Chufunga,\nand Hay have all used idioms. Lin Shiao\nimmediately raised his question. My\nfellow countrymen of Liao, our\ndescendants are ultimately stronger than\nwe imagined. Hearing Lyn Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s\nquestion, the leader of the shadowy\nfigures, felt a sense of relief. The\npower of habit is great. Even with the\nshield that covers the entire Long Shia,\neven though we have not studied history\nfor 5,000 years and have been constantly\neroded by Western and Japanese culture,\na few Lshia people will still\noccasionally utter an idiom and mention\nthe names of one or two people. These\nidioms and names are already considered\ntaboo knowledge passed down from\naristocratic families. But if you ask\nthem, they definitely won't know who\nChin Sher Huang is or what the idiom\nmeans. Not to mention uttering a single\nline of poetry. Lin Sha finally\nunderstood that the inaccurate idioms he\nhad encountered and the nonsensical\nappearance of Chin Sher Huang were all\ndue to the traitors historical\nshielding. No wonder there are no\nChinese military units in this world\nexcept for ourselves. Hei, we've been\nchatting for too long. The shadowy\nleader said, I have something important\nto discuss with you. As you know, in\norder to protect us, this group of\nancient Chinese warriors hiding in the\nrifts of time and space, the dragon\npeople abandoned their own history. But\nthe traitors did not keep their promise.\nFor the past 5,000 years, they have\nnever ceased their pursuit. The third\nshadowy figure said angrily. We've even\nbeen dubbed ancient demons. For nearly a\nthousand years, some unsuspecting Long\nSha people have even joined the hunt.\nThis is absolutely outrageous. This is a\nheartless act. These traitors have gone\ntoo far. Aside from the title ancient\ndemon, I actually quite like it. He\nBefore the second shadowy figure could\nfinish speaking, the eldest and third\nbrothers slapped him on the forehead.\nSeeing this, Lyn Sha shook his head and\nslowly said, \"So, what do you want me to\ndo? It's too early to tell you what to\ndo now.\" The leader of the shadowy\nfigures said in a deep voice, \"It took\nus 3,000 years to create the Hashia\ntoken, which can summon the heroic\nspirits of emperors and generals of\nChina over thousands of years. You have\nalready witnessed its power. We\noriginally intended to entrust the Hasha\ntoken to the most powerful warrior among\nthe surviving ancient demons, but some\nsuggested that it should be given to the\ncurrent dragon Sia domain lord, that\nyoung lady, as she might still possess\nthe Hasha heritage. But the first time\nwe used the Hasha token, it flew towards\nyou on its own initiative and chose you,\nthe third shadowy figure said in a deep\nvoice. Listen to Lin Xiaawua&lt;unk&gt;s\norder. It is the key to saving the\nChinese nation and ensuring the survival\nof Chinese civilization. It is also the\nkey to helping the Lia people regain\ntheir cultural confidence and become\ntrue descendants of the Chinese nation.\nIf you have lofty ambitions, the Hasha\ndecree is still the key to bringing the\nHasha race and even the human race back\nto the pinnacle of the battlefield of\nall races. The leader of the shadowy\nfigures chuckled twice. Without our\nChina, these traitors and even the\nentire human race of blue star can only\nsurvive in the ninth heaven. It's truly\ndisappointing. But the leader of the\nshadowy figures changed his tone. Our\nonly requirement for you now is survive.\nHide your true strength live until you\nare fully grown. Don't trust anyone. The\nthree figures in black spoke in unison.\nTheir voices extremely serious. That's\nwhy I came to inform you in advance. The\nshadowy elder said. Although no Chinese\nwarriors have appeared for 5,000 years,\nthere are still some immortal traitors\non the battlefield of all races. They\nmight still remember the name of the\nChinese warriors if they discover you\nand us. Any connection with our ancient\ndemons will be nipped in the bud.\nTherefore, preserve your strength,\nsurvive, and wait until you are strong\nenough. Once you are strong enough to\noverthrow the traitors, you can\nrightfully make a name for the Chinese\nmilitary. On this battlefield of myriad\nraces, there are many geniuses who can\ncreate their own troops and countless\nlord talents. As long as you use some\ntechniques, you can hide yourself very\nwell. Most importantly, don't get into\nconflicts with people casually, the\nleader of the shadowy figure said\nearnestly. Also, don't reveal your\nChinese military branch casually. The\nsecond shadowy figure earnestly\ninstructed. Add one more thing. In the\nbattlefield of all races, one must\nalways keep a low profile. The third\nshadowy figure added. Lyn Sha, you\nshould have said so earlier. Three\nshadowy figures. We're&lt;unk&gt; late, aren't\nwe? Lyn Sha shook his head. It's all\nright. I've taken care of it. If you\neliminate the people causing the\nconflict, the conflict will cease. If\nyou kill anyone who sees the Chinese\nsoldiers, then no one will see them\nanymore. Once everyone who knew I wasn't\nLoki is dead, no one will know I wasn't\nLoki anymore. Who exposed himself with\nthe divine crossbow was merely called\nthe Gust Archer. Lyn Sha now knows the\nreal reason why the ancient demon sought\nhim out. It was to warn him to be\ncareful and not to expose himself.\nSuddenly, Lyn Sha remembered something\nelse. You sent Ba here, but then she\nfailed you at the crucial moment. Was\nthat your doing? He he that s right? The\nsecond shadowy figure laughed. Why do\nthis? Lyn Sha thought to himself. Sure\nenough, Ba's inexplicable period is\ndefinitely related to these cackling\nChinese elders. Get Ba's loyalty to 100\nbefore taking her down. It will be more\nbeneficial for you. The second shadowy\nfigure gave a knowing look. Lyn Shia,\nthey're already at 90% loyalty and can\ndo whatever they want. Is this still not\nallowed? Also, aren't you from another\nuniverse? How come you also use the word\npush down? The shadowy figure remained\nsilent. Lyn Sha shook his head again and\nasked, \"Is there anything else you\nwanted to say to me this time? Be wary\nof any attempts to win us over. Don't\njoin any of Lshia's organizations, not\neven the official ones. We don't know\nhow deep the waters run here or how many\ntraders have already infiltrated, the\nshadowy leader said slowly. That's why\nwe went to the trouble of using magical\nmarkings to find you in advance. Also,\nthis time when you're aiming for a\nsecond tier university, don't try to be\nnumber one again. If you compete for\nfirst place, it will likely break\nrecords. The god system will announce it\nthroughout the entire blue star.\nMoreover, winning first place twice in a\nrow could attract the attention of the\nentire blue star. At that time, you\nwon't be able to keep a low profile even\nif you want to. Lynn Sha suddenly\nremembered, \"Was it you who changed the\nlast announcement about the god system?\"\nLynn Sha remembers that the announcement\nwas downgraded from a worldwide\nannouncement to a regionwide\nannouncement, and even the legendary\ntreasure chest reward was reduced to an\nepic treasure chest. Exactly. The third\nshadowy figure replied. Then why not\njust keep making changes this time? The\nthird shadowy figure said helplessly.\nIt's too tiring to revise it once. I\ndon't have the strength to revise it a\nsecond time. I'm so tired. I don't have\nthe strength to revise it a second time.\nSo they told me not to compete for first\nplace. Lyn Sha shook his head and\nanother thought popped into his mind.\nThis is truly a kind yet weak ancient\ndemon. Chapter 70. the secrets to using\nthe Hasha decree, seemingly sensing Lin\nXiao's doubts, the third shadowy figure\nadded. Don't worry, you can still snatch\nthe top spot from the third tier\nuniversities. I know the first place\nreward in the threebook system is very\nimportant to you since it adds a hero\nslot and once you enter the official\nserver, you won't be able to upgrade\nyour manner to recruit a hero. We're\njust reminding you that the chances of a\nnovice winning three consecutive titles\nare very high, attracting the attention\nof the higher realms. For you right now,\nthe risk is very high. Lynn Sha remained\nsilent. He had also learned about people\nin school who ranked first in the entire\nregion across all three levels of\nuniversity entrance exams. These people\nwere being described by the shadowy\nfigure as winning three consecutive top\nhonors. However, all of these people\nlater became prominent figures on the\nentire blue star and even in the ninth\nheaven. The shadowy figures warning was\nvery timely because I'm going to be\npromoted to a second tier university\ntonight. Barring any unforeseen\ncircumstances, thanks to my powerful\neternal peace talent, I'm guaranteed to\nbe number one in the second tier\nuniversity again. Now, I have no choice\nbut to give up first place. Fortunately,\nthe first place in the second tier\nuniversities only gets a reward chest.\n\"All right, if there's nothing else,\nI'll head back now,\" Lin Sha said\ncalmly. \"Is the flow of time here the\nsame as outside?\" \"Of course, they're\nthe same. We're&lt;unk&gt; also a rift in the\nnine heavens. How could there be a\ndifference in the flow of time?\" The\nthird shadowy figure asked in surprise.\n\"Could there be places where the flow of\ntime is different?\" Lyn Sha felt that\nwhenever technical issues were\ndiscussed, the third shadowy figure\nwould answer them quite\nenthusiastically. Unexpectedly, the\nthird shadowy figure seemed to have a\nnew world opened up to him because of\nhis question, and he fell into a days.\nThe flow of time can be different. He\nkept muttering to himself, \"Never mind.\nI've never actually seen a place where\nthe flow of time is different. I've only\nheard about it.\" Lyn Sha thought to\nhimself. I've heard about this in online\nnovels. But since the flow of time is\nthe same, and I've been talking to you\nhere for quite a while, the people in\nthe territory must be worried about me.\nSeeing this, the second shadowy figure\nunderstood and said, \"He, young friend,\nLyn Shia, are you worried that Ba is\nplotting something against you? Don't\nworry. Even without 100 loyalty points,\nyou can still force your way in.\" The\nleader of the shadowy figures tried to\nraise his hand, but the second in\ncommand quickly dodged the attack.\n\"Speaking of Baoi, you actually stopped\nme and Baoi from consummating our\nmarriage,\" Lin Shao said suspiciously.\n\"So that means you can use the Hasha\ntoken to see my activities. If something\nhappens between me and Baoi, you won't\nspy on me, will you? I can't see it,\"\nthe shadowy elder said. We can only\nsense your approximate location and the\nstatus of the Hasha order. Then why was\nthe timing of Bao's period so\ncoincidental? That's the succubus\nprincess's magical mark. It's visible.\nThe leader of the shadowy figures was\nsomewhat embarrassed. Then she passed it\non to us. Lyn Sha remained\nexpressionless. Then we did something\nshady. Lyn Sha, but don't worry. The\nmagical mark has been ineffective since\nyou came here. From now on, we'll use\nour own secret code to communicate. The\nleader of the shadowy figures quickly\nuttered a coded message, then said,\n\"Indeed, it's getting late. I'll take\nyou back now to avoid any further\ncomplications.\" \"Okay,\" Lyn Sha added.\n\"Since the Hasha token was created by\nyou, what are the tricks to using it?\nPlease enlighten us, Ancient Demon\nSenior.\" Lyn Shiao immediately told the\nshadowy figure about his confusion\nregarding summoning the heroic spirits\nof China. Oh, that's the problem. It's\nno big deal. I'll show you how to use it\nright away. He the Hasha token can be\nupgraded and there will be more usage\ntips after the upgrade. Goodbye, young\nfriend from China. We'll meet again\nsomeday. With a wave of his hand, the\nleader of the shadowy figures sent Lin\nXiao's consciousness plunging into a\nspatial temporal turbulence once more on\nthe verge of losing contact with this\nplace shrouded in black mist. Suddenly,\nLyn Sha shouted again, \"What does that\nsuccubus have to do with us?\" It was\njust mutual exploitation. The leader's\nvoice came from afar. Then, everything\nspun around and Lynn Shia returned to\nhis body. He was already standing in\nfront of the Lord&lt;unk&gt;'s mansion in the\nbattlefield of the myriad races vying\nfor supremacy. Beside him, Baoi and Pay\nMin watched him nervously. Not far away,\nTang Yi and Song Ruer along with a group\nof burly Chinese men surrounded him,\nvigilantly observing the surrounding\narea. Upon seeing Lin Shiao open his\neyes, both Baoi and Pay men were\noverjoyed, and Baoi immediately pounced\non him. My lord, it's so good to see\nyou're all right. Ba's voice trembled\nslightly. Whether it was a genuine\nexpression of emotion or the nature of a\nvixen, it was hard to tell. A warm\nfeeling flashed through Linhao&lt;unk&gt;s\nheart. How long have I been standing\nhere? Reporting to the Lord, it has been\nmore than half an hour. Pay Min replied,\nthe hour or so was roughly the same as\nthe time it took me to go to the ancient\ndemons place. Do I have any other\nabnormalities? My lord merely stood\nsilently and I was unable to rouse him.\nSo I waited until young master pay Min\nand Tang Ye were free before summoning\nthem. Lyn Sha realized that Baoi was the\nfirst to notice his abnormality. Wait a\nminute. Can you free your hands now?\nWhat happened? Lyn Sha asked. Just now\nwhile the Lord was in meditation, a\nlarge group of demons and monsters\nsuddenly attacked from the darkness\noutside the territory. Ba replied. Young\nMaster Pay Min and his soldiers\nimmediately organized a defense and the\nkilling was completed just half an hour\nago. That there were still traces of\nblood on the swords of Tang Yi and the\nothers who were surrounding them to be\nattacked by monsters at night for no\nreason. This is an unheard of\nphenomenon. The battlefield of all races\nis very dangerous at night. But in the\nnewbie zone, apart from specific\nsettings such as triggering demonic\ntides and beast tides, there are no\nother attacks at night. Lyn Sha\nimmediately led everyone to the entrance\nof the territory. From the territory\ngate to the outside of the wall, there\nwere still many remains of bones and\nremains that had not yet been melted or\nrefreshed. That must have been a\ndefensive battle organized by Pay Min.\nThe MO Dao iron guards held the gate\nwhile the divine arm archers and phantom\narchers fired from behind, successfully\ndefending against the attack. Lynsha\nlooked at the remains and bones. There\nare many of them, mostly low-level\ndemons and orcs, plus some exceptional\nunits like fierce demons and berserkers.\nIt's probably equivalent to a C to be\nlevel demon tide difficulty. With the\npresence of the Chinese troops, the\nformidable swordsmen pay men and bao\nsees breathtaking beauty holding the\nline should be a close call. After a\nmoment of contemplation, Lyn Shao nodded\nand said to everyone, \"Thank you all for\nyour hard work.\" Just now, I had a\nsudden inspiration and gained some\ninsights, and I instantly entered a\nmeditative state. \"Thanks to everyone\nwho defended the Lord's manner. We swear\nto serve our lord to the death. The\ncrowd shouted in unison. Ba also glanced\nat Lyn Sha as if she knew something, but\nher eyes were full of trust and loyalty\nto Lyn Sha. Looking at the beautiful\nwoman beside him, Lynsha nodded. He\nwould have a good chat with this\npeerless enchantress about human nature.\nLater, unfortunately, the second shadowy\nfigure said it's best to reach 100%\ntrust before taking her down. This\ndefensive battle fought without his\npresence was easily withstood. Lynn\nShiao couldn't help but marvel at the\nstrength of his troops and their\ninvincible heroism. With Bowsi around,\ndefending the city is much easier. Just\nthe 100% increase in health and then\nnever retreat. Perk is enough to get you\na lord talent of a rank or higher. Since\neveryone has been so supportive, a\nreward is definitely in order. Everyone\nfollow me. Tonight, we'll cook some\nspirit rice porridge and roast some\nbarbarian beef to treat you all. Long\nlive the lord. Chapter 71. Three\nchoices. Meanwhile, inside the destroyed\ncastle, Dinglay, who had already turned\noff his live stream, was leaning against\nthe wall, bandaging his wounds. He\nglanced at Tu Shawn by Chin in the\ndistance from time to time, and noticed\nthat the little girl was also watching\nhim wearily. Just then, a communication\ncall came in. A masked man appeared on\nthe other end of the communication.\nExcellent performance. Your strength is\neven greater than I imagined. The masked\nman affirmed in a low voice as soon as\nthe communication connected. They\nactually managed to defeat the death\nknight. You flatter me. It was just a\nbit of luck. Nothing to brag about.\nDinglay said casually. Huh? Still with\nthat arrogant attitude. Seeing him makes\nme want to punch the masked man. Did you\nget any good gear after killing the\ndeath knight? the masked man asked.\nAfter all, it was your first time\nplaying, and you were challenging\nsomeone of a higher level. He he\nguessed. Dinglay did not give a direct\nanswer. The masked man narrowed his\neyes, seemingly increasingly disliking\nDing Lay's nonchalant demeanor, and said\nagain, \"That stupid, beautiful woman is\nstill in the castle, right? Just capture\nher, and if you can't, kill her on the\nspot. You have a slaying talisman,\nright? You won't be punished for killing\nher.\" Why? Dinglay remained indifferent.\nYou ask me why? The masked man raised\nhis voice. I gave you so many troops\nprecisely so you could deal with Lyn\nShiao, didn't I? Liao&lt;unk&gt;s vassal lord\nis not far from you now. Killing her,\neven without Lyn Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s help, is a\npiece of cake for your strength just\nnow. That stupid woman may not have many\ntroops, but her centaur lord is quite\npowerful in the beginner area. By doing\nthis, you've wiped out one of Linhao's\narms. He Dinglay laughed. I won't do it.\nWhy? The masked man retorted. The deal\nwe made is to deal with Lyn Sha, not\nanyone else. But the beautiful woman is\nalso a vassal lord of Lyn Sha. Wouldn't\nkilling her weaken Lyn Sha. If she were\non the front lines fighting against me,\nLyn Sha would have a legitimate reason\nto kill her, but that's not the case\nnow. Dinglay wiped his long sword and\nslowly sheathed it. Besides, I promised\nnot to lay a hand on her in front of\ntens of thousands of people in the\nliveream. A promise? What's a promise\nworth? There's no contract. He Dinglay\nslowly stood up, put his hands behind\nhis back, and looked up at the sky. Wong\nSu, the top 100 expert lord in the Lan\nregion, may not have a promise to you,\nbut he may have no promise to others,\nbut to me, it's very valuable. You're in\nthe top 100,\" the masked man snapped\nangrily. \"And you have no right to\nbargain with me. You took my recruitment\ntoken, so you have to work for me. Got\nit. I'll handle dealing with Lin Sha.\"\nDinglay abruptly shut down the\ncommunication. Huh? My talent doesn't\nallow me to do this kind of thing. I can\nonly use my own methods. With this\nweapon, we are even more confident in\ndealing with Lin Shiao. After saying\nthat, Dinglay took out another weapon\nfrom his spatial storage. An iceb blue\nlong sword surrounded by wisps of cold\nair. A ferocious skull was also carved\non the hilt of the long sword.\nMeanwhile, while the heroes and soldiers\nwere happily eating and drinking, Lyn\nSha quietly left and went to the lord's\nmansion. I promised Fongu I would\ncontact Chu, you see, so let's do it\nnow. Lyn Sha pressed the ID number\nagain, and this time the call finally\nwent through successfully. On the other\nend of the communication interface, a\nmiddle-aged man in a suit and tie with\nan extraordinary demeanor appeared on\nthe virtual screen. Hello, Lord Chu. Lyn\nShia, I'm so glad you came to see me.\nChu Yusi wore a warm smile. Fungu and I\nhave mentioned you many times and told\nme about your situation. Let's get\nstraight to the point. Chu Yusi&lt;unk&gt;s\nexpression turned serious regarding your\ndealings with Xiao Daong and Gene Dang.\nThis time you did not make any mistakes\nin terms of the rules of the battlefield\nof 10,000 races. However, you were a\nlittle too hasty in terms of actual\noperation. Lyn Shao was slightly\npuzzled. The city lord here to demand an\nexplanation. Seeing Lin Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s\nconfusion, Chu Yusi's tense face relaxed\nand he slowly said, \"If it were me, I\nwould deal with Gene Dang, who was live\nstreaming first and then take down\nXiaoang. That way I would minimize the\nimpact of the situation. Those two\nscumbags deserve to die. You did the\nright thing. Having said that, Chu Yusi\nlooked up to the sky and laughed loudly.\nHara, well done. Lyn Shia breathed a\nsigh of relief. If they weren't here to\ninterrogate him, then they were here to\nwin him over. Chu Yusi spoke quickly.\nThe reason I asked you to come to me\nthis time is actually nothing more than\nthat I've already heard the announcement\nthat the black flame lord of the\nofficial district is going to break\nthrough the district and deal with you.\nDon't be afraid of the arrival of the\nbroken zone. I can also arrange for a\nmaster to arrive to protect you. If\nthere's not enough time, I can provide\nother assistance. Even if that sneaky\nmasked lord or some top 100 lord comes\ndown in person, I can make sure he never\nreturns. Shu Yui truly lived up to his\nreputation as a madman from Jangd Dong.\nThis disdainful attitude of his son was\npassed down to him. Thank you, city\nlord, but I don't want to trouble you.\nLyn Shao pondered for a moment, then\nslowly spoke. What? Chu Yui seemed not\nto have heard clearly. What did you say?\nLyn Shia did not want to trouble the\ncity lord. He only wanted to deal with\nthe lord who had broken through the\ndistrict this time on his own. Why do\nyou say that? I didn't even negotiate\nany conditions. I was just offering you\nprotection. Chui asked puzzled. You made\nthis mess, so you have to take\nresponsibility for it. Lyn Shao said\nslowly. One should take responsibility\nfor one's own actions. I don't want to\ninvolve the city lord and phone go. Chu\nYusi stared blankly at Lin Shiao for\nseveral seconds, then suddenly realized,\nwell, Chu Yusi nodded slowly. Not long\nago, Jabbron came to me and said that I\nhad three choices. One was to accept my\noffer without hesitation, even though my\nhelp was unconditional. But if you\nchoose this path, you can at most grow\ninto a top ranking ranger lord in the\ndragon summer domain, fighting for the\ndragon summer domain in the blue star\nrealm. Second, ask about my conditions,\nnegotiate with me, or only ask for\nlimited assistance and repay it quickly.\nSomeone like you could become a\ntopranked ranger lord on the blue star\nbattlefield, conquering the ninth\nheaven. The third option was to politely\ndecline my help after clarifying my\nconditions. Chu Yusi's face was grave,\nbut a sharp glint flashed in his eyes.\nThe prophet said that you will suffer\nendless hardships, but as long as you\nsurvive, you may become a great hero of\nthe blue star world. I didn't expect you\nto refuse my help without even asking my\nconditions. Do you know something? Or\nwhat makes you think you can do this?\nChu Yusi's expression grew colder and\ncolder and his aura slowly emanated,\nreaching Lin Shiao through the screen.\nThe madman of Jang Dong, the city lord\nof Jang Dong, sincerely tried to recruit\nhim, but was rejected by a greenhorn who\nhad just started out, and they rejected\nhim without even hearing his conditions.\nWhere does that leave him with his\npride? Lyn Shao first gave a ry smile,\nthen calmly said, \"I don't think about\nwhether I can succeed. Since I have\nchosen the distant horizon, I will only\nbrave the wind and rain to get there.\"\nLord Shu Lyn Sha has no disrespect for\nyou. But this disaster was caused by me,\nand it will end because of me. If I need\nto ask for help, even for a simple trial\nin the beginner zone, how can I ever\nachieve my goal of becoming the ruler?\nChapter 72. send someone to protect him.\nI don't think about whether I can\nsucceed. Since I've chosen the distant\nhorizon, I'll just brave the wind and\nrain to get there. If I need to ask for\nhelp, even for a simple trial in the\nbeginner's area, how can I ever achieve\nmy goal of becoming the dominant force?\nChu Yusi pondered Lin Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s words,\nlost in thought. That's wonderful.\nHaving chosen the distant horizon, I\nbraved wind and rain to reach it. I've\nnever heard this saying before, yet it's\nso philosophical. This is the\nmasterpiece that made a modern poet\nfamous in my world, Lynn Sha thought to\nhimself. Chu Yusi was, after all, a\ndecent person. He wouldn't really be\nangry because Lyn Sha refused his help.\nOn the contrary, he admired Lin Sha even\nmore because of his integrity. Is this\nwhy you with only an F rank lord talent\nwere able to get first place in a book\nand even create the Gust Archer,\nbecoming the first lord this year to\ncreate a new troop type. Kid, you're\nreally good. Chu Yusi nodded\nappreciatively. I originally intended to\nsend people to help you without imposing\nany restrictions on you. It was just an\ninvestment. The only thing you would\nhave to give up was that you would be\nlabeled as part of the Gangdong City\nLords faction in the future. This is a\ngood thing. It will make countless\nvillains think twice before they want to\nmess with you. But it's not necessarily\na good thing because you will have fewer\ntrials and tribulations. You have the\nability and the ambition. That's good,\nbut this will make you very tired and\nyour road ahead will be full of\nhardships. Chu Yusi sighed, his eyes\nseemingly filled with emotion. If only\nChufinga had your level of awareness.\nAlthough he's arrogant, he still has his\nown talent to back him up. and I'm there\nto support him. How many people in this\nworld can truly rely solely on\nthemselves? Chu Yusi shook his head and\nadded, \"Since this is your choice, I can\nonly respect it. This crisis is entirely\nup to you.\" To use a trendy phrase,\n\"It's like saying, \"I don't understand,\nbut I respect it.\" Lyn Sha thought to\nhimself, \"Do you think I don't want to\nrely on powerful figures? But now the\nancient demons are telling me that the\nChinese troops can't be easily exposed\nand I have to endure it until I reach\nthe official server. The map there is\nhuge. Even if you're exposed and\nattacked, you might not be able to find\nthe coordinates. Thank you, Lord City\nLord. Lyn Sha remained calm on the\nsurface, waiting for Chu Yusi to hang up\nthe communication. Lyn Sha, is there\nsome secret? Chu Yusi shook his head,\nthen dialed another person's number.\nAfter a short wait, the communication\nwas established. A cold, authoritative\nvoice came from the other end, \"What's\nthe situation?\" Chu Yusi lowered his\nhead slightly and said in a respectful\ntone, \"He refused my help. A third\noption, no.\" He didn't even hear the end\nof my conditions. There was a moment of\nsilence on the other end of the\ncommunication. \"Send a few people.\nProtect him secretly.\" Shu Yui suddenly\nlooked up. \"Could it be that you want\nto?\" Chu Yusi extended his right hand,\nclenched his fist, raised his thumb, and\npulled it from his left shoulder to his\nright shoulder, making a throat slitting\nmotion. A moment of silence, a cold\nvoice, tinged with annoyance, said,\n\"Chui, stop making such vulgar gestures\nin front of me. And where did you learn\nyour skill of guessing what your\nsuperiors want?\" Chu Yusi was somewhat\nsurprised. Could it be that I guessed\nright? The cold voice rose three\noctaves. What do you think? He he just\nkidding. Your majesty always has such a\nserious face. I'm just trying to help\nyou relax. Before Lqing&lt;unk&gt;s voice\ncould fully erupt, Chu Yusi quickly\nsaid, \"I will definitely send someone to\nprotect Lin Sha in secret. But since he\nhas chosen not to need help, why should\nwe keep pestering him?\" The cold voice\nslowly said, \"I will only tell you that\nJabbron told me that he observed that\nLia&lt;unk&gt;s fate was inextricably linked\nto this boy. My first prophet Lord, he\nhas never been wrong in his predictions.\nTherefore, if he is loyal to Lang Shiao,\nwe must help him become a regional\nhijgemon. But if he is recruited by\nother countries or forces and goes\nastray, Chu Yusi raised his head and saw\nthe current number one person in the\nDragon Sia domain on the other side of\nthe screen slowly making a throat\nslitting gesture. Chu Yusi. Meanwhile,\nLyn Sha finished communicating with Chu\nYusi. He then simply inspected his\nterritory and took stock of his\nresources. Open the resource panel.\nLords all resources panel. Experience\n2,514,562.\nI was almost out of experience, but I\ngained a lot more from the night raid\njust now. Gold coins 165408.\nExcellent treasure chest eight. Rare\ntreasure chest five.

Absolutely no shortage.\nUnit type: 10 iron guards with mo Dao\nBao, all level 11. 10 archers with\ndivine crossbows, all level 11. There\nare 42 Phantom archers, all level 16.\nHero, Sword, Saint Pay Min, level 12.\nBa, level one. I have already met the\nconditions for upgrading my lord's\nmansion to level two. Lynn Shia opened\nthe panel and confirmed it again.\nUpgrade requirements. Prerequisite\nbuildings. Tavern 1/1. Spirit field May\n1st. Saved. Required resources 5,000\nwood, 5,000 stone, 3,000 iron or 3,000\ncopper or 500 refined iron, 500 refined\ncopper. Saved. Let's listen to the\nshadows this time. Let's not upgrade\nyet. Let's postpone it until tomorrow\nmorning. If there are no calculation\nerrors, Dugu Jaolan should have used a\nvery rare acceleration spell and will\ncomplete the upgrade to tier 2 between\ntomorrow morning and noon. I clicked to\nupgrade again in the morning and it took\n12 hours until 8 or 9 p.m. for the\nupgrade to be completed. If we can't get\nfirst place, we can still get into the\ntop 10. At the same time, I also need to\nget into a third tier university as soon\nas possible. This the resources for the\nthree levels are hard to obtain. I was\noriginally going to farm the destruction\ncastle again tomorrow and be able to\ncollect most of the materials for the\nthree levels, but Ding Lay actually\nfarmed the destruction castle first.\nThinking of Ding Lay and his unusual\nbehavior, Lyn Shao casually dialed the\nnumber of the beautiful girl. Chapter\n73. in-depth communication with Baoi. As\nsoon as the call connected, two Snow\nWhite figures came into view on the\nother end of the screen. Lyn Sha was\nsuddenly shocked. What a deaf\nperspective is Tu Shan by Chin doing?\nUpon closer inspection, Lyn Sha realized\nthey were two fluffy snow white animal\npaws. Tu Shan Chen, what are you doing?\nBoss Lin Sha, keep your voice down. I'm\nobserving Dinglay. Tonchian said in a\nlow voice. She had transformed into a\nsnow white fox perched on the centaur\nleader's back and was secretly watching\nDing lay opposite her. Through her\nperspective, Lyn Sha could also see the\nman opposite her who had just gone\nthrough a major battle. After the little\nsister turns into a fox, she can see\nfarther and is not greatly affected in\ndark environments. So that's how it is.\nNo wonder Tu Shawn by Chin style\nsuddenly changed so drastically. Lynn\nSha thought to himself, secretly\nconfirming Tu Shan by Chin&lt;unk&gt;s point\nand thinking that this woman did have\nsome brains. He didn't do anything to\nyou, did he? No, boss. Lin Shiao Ding\nLay seems to be quite law-abiding. Tu\nSha by Chin whispered. He seemed to have\nreceived a call just now, but it was too\nfar away for me to hear what he said. Is\nthere anything else unusual? H I think I\nsaw Ding Lelay get a weapon and he just\ntook it out to clean it. Tan by Chin\nchuckled. He thought I couldn't see this\nside, but I can see it perfectly\nclearly. It was a great sword that\nlooked a lot like the weapon in the\nhands of a death knight. It was ice blue\nand looked very sharp. There was also a\nskull on the hilt. Could this be that\nweapon? Lyn Sha had a guess in his mind.\nThat's a very dangerous weapon. Be\ncareful, Lyn Sha warned. If Ding Lay\nbrings it up again, you must observe it\ncarefully, and it would be best to take\na screenshot for me. Okay, boss Lyn Sha.\nAfter ending his communication with the\nbeautiful girl, Lynn Sha returned to the\nLord&lt;unk&gt;'s manor. I went over all the\nmatters in my mind one last time. It's\nlate at night. It's time to rest.\nUpgrading to a second tier university\nwill be tomorrow morning. As Lyn Sha\nwalked into the bedroom, a beautiful\nfigure suddenly appeared before him.\nThis humble servant will attend to the\nlord's bath. The stunningly beautiful\nenchantress Ba had just bathed. Her\nblack silk cascaded down her shoulders\nlike a waterfall, and her face was fair\nand flawless, as if sculpted from ice\ncrystal. With a blush and shinyness on\nher face, she bowed deeply and came over\nto remove Lyn Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s armor. Not far\naway, behind a screen, a bathtub was\nalready filled with hot water. Feeling\nthe service of the stunningly beautiful\nwoman, Lyn Zhiao&lt;unk&gt;s emotions\ngradually stirred. He looked at Baoi,\nbut Baoi seemed to know his thoughts.\nHer head was lowered deeply, and the\nblush on her face extended to her\nslender neck. Bowsi was not wearing the\nforest witch's cloak, but only a\nclose-fitting undergarment with a light\ngauze overlay. Lyn Shao was immediately\nfilled with admiration and fascination.\nBa Lyn Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s voice was gentle and\ncaptivating. Grown-ups. Baosi let out a\nsoft moan and almost leaned against Lin\nSha. Did you run the bathwater? H, it\nwas I who did it. Did you move this huge\nbucket here? Yes, you're really strong.\nLynn Sha patted Ba on the shoulder to\nshow his approval. Ba stood there\ndumbfounded. Lyn Shiao, by the way, did\nyou wash it? Huh? This humble servant\ndares not accept that your highness's\nsoup is fresh. Oh. Taking advantage of\nBao's dazed state, Lyn Sha took off all\nhis clothes and jumped into the bathtub.\nThe comforting hot water made Lynn Sha\nfeel completely relaxed from his toes\nall the way to the top of his head, and\nhe couldn't help but groan with\nsatisfaction. A pair of warm, slender\nhands then rested on Linhao's shoulders.\nGently gather, slowly twist, smear, and\npick. First, it's the rainbow skirt,\nthen the six melodies. Is my technique\nsatisfactory, my lord? Satisfy. Lyn Shao\nclosed his eyes and lay in the bathtub,\nenjoying the comfort of the beauty.\nAlthough Bao's technique was clumsy, her\nseductive talent was undeniable, and\neven a casual pinch was enough to feel\ncomfortable. Lynho&lt;unk&gt;s tense nerves,\nwhich had been stretched taut since\nentering the battlefield of myriad\nraces, were relieved at this moment. He\nrelaxed, his mind blank, and rested\nfreely. After a moment, Lyn Shao asked,\n\"Baoi, I saw an ancient demon today.\"\nThe little hand behind her back paused\nfor a moment. \"Is this the time for the\nLord to enter meditation?\" \"Exactly.\" Ba\nremained silent for a moment, then\nslowly said, \"My Lord, although I was\nsaved by an ancient demon, I do not\nunderstand them. I am grateful to the\nancient demon for bringing me to your\nside, but I am utterly loyal to my\nlord.\" Lynsha kept his eyes closed, his\nhands resting on either side of the\nbathtub. The rising steam brushed\nagainst his face, making him appear\nexceptionally handsome. He spoke slowly,\nhis magnetic voice remarkably calm. Do\nnot panic, Ba. You've told me everything\nyou needed to say. I believe you. The\nhands behind his back seemed to breathe\na sigh of relief. This time, I\nspecifically asked the ancient demon a\nquestion about you. About me? Ba's voice\nwas filled with curiosity. Your\nmenstrual period was caused by ancient\nevil spirits. They triggered a mark in\nyour body, causing you to have your\nperiod early. Oh. Ba covered her mouth\nin surprise. How could this be? Why is\nthat? Because they said that once your\nloyalty reaches 100 points, they can\ntake you down and I can get a bigger\nbenefit from it. Ba was at a loss for\nwords after Lynn Shia bluntly asked her,\n\"What do you mean pull down? This humble\nservant already belongs entirely to your\nhighness. You already belong to me\ncompletely? Lyn Sha asked deliberately.\nBa's voice was barely audible. The kind\nwhere you can do whatever you want. Ba's\nvoice was almost inaudible. Ding. You\nhave aroused Ba's shyness. Ba sees two\nincreased to minus 83. Lyn Sha was\noverjoyed. Had it improved again? He\nguessed its loyalty had increased a bit\ntoo. Why is this vixen even more shy\nthan me in some ways? Let's strike while\nthe iron is hot. Lyn Sha nodded slowly\nand said, \"Since that's the case, I have\nalready warned the ancient demons that\nthis will not happen again. I shall not\ndo anything to you again. Also, that\nmark is a one-time use item and will not\ntake effect again.\" I told the ancient\ndemons, \"My woman cannot be manipulated\nby others as a tool. Not even a touch is\nallowed. Ah my lord. Ba covered her\ncherry-like mouth tightly with both\nhands and tears involuntarily streamed\ndown her innocent big eyes. Ding. You\nhave moved. Ba. Ba's two elements\nreversal. Luck value has increased to\nminus 80. Not bad. Not bad. It's been\nquite effective. Lyn Shia nodded in\nsatisfaction. He had taken enough time\nfor a bath today. Now it was time to get\ndown to business. Sleep. Lyn Sha stood\nup abruptly, the splashing waters\nstartling Baoi, who was still immersed\nin her emotions. As she looked up, she\nwas immediately met with her lord's\ntall, slender frame, broad and muscular\nchest, and sharply defined abs. Ba\nimmediately lowered her body in\nembarrassment, her heart pounding in her\nchest. Your lord's figure is truly\nmagnificent. Suddenly, she regretted\nthat her behavior did not live up to the\ntitle of enchantress. So, she mustered\nup her courage and raised her head\nslightly, wanting to take another look.\nThis time, what greeted him was Lin\nXiao&lt;unk&gt;s eyes, which seemed to be\nsmiling, but weren't. He had already put\non his robe. What do you want to see?\nThis concubine? This concubine? Watching\nlike this isn't enough? How about I\nperform a magic trick for you? Oh,\nwithout saying a word, Lyn Sha pulled\nBaoi, whose face was flushed to the\nbedside. Lie down, my lord. I shall\nreturn. Just lie down. Lyn Sha glanced\nat her indifferently, and Ba immediately\ndared not utter a sound, her eyes\nseeming to overflow with tears. This\nmagic trick is called falling asleep in\n3 seconds. Oh. After Lyn Sha finished\nspeaking, he lay down on the bed, kicked\nhis legs, closed his eyes, and\nimmediately fell into a deep sleep.\nBefore going to sleep, Lynn Sha had only\none thought in his mind. Damn it, it's\nonly been a day, and these ancient\ndemons are truly awful. Chapter 74.\nObjective: The four rare resources. Just\nas Lin Sha was fast asleep. Midnight. In\na well-ordered territory with towering\nwalls and sharp arrow towers, a tall,\nbeautiful, and aloof girl sat with her\nlegs together, quietly examining a\nturquoise sword in her hand. A fine\nsword. A magnetic female voice rang out,\nand a woman of extraordinary stature\nslowly approached. She had messy,\nflowing, fiery red hair and wore a\nbeautifully designed golden helmet with\ntwo wings that covered the upper half of\nher face. She was dressed in a golden\narmor suit, but what was most striking\nwas her right hand, which was a golden\nprosthetic limb with a long sharp sword\nat the end. Marleneia Dugu Jaolon said\nslowly looking at the approaching\nValkyrie. Are you feeling better? My\nlord, Marleneia bowed. Thank you for\nyour help, my lord. The crimson\ncorruption has been largely suppressed.\nWhere the lord's blade points, Marlinia\nwill be invincible. Mm. Dugu Jella\nnodded. 3 2 1. She counted silently in\nher mind. All right, cool down. Time's\nup. Time to upgrade to tier 2. That's\ngreat. A valiant female soldier cheered\nexcitedly beside Dugu Jaon. Miss will\ndefinitely win first place this time.\nHuh, don't be too happy yet. Dugjon said\nat our pace, it will take more than 10\nhours to complete the upgrade to the\nsecond level this afternoon. Completing\nthe second level on the third day after\nentering the battlefield of 10,000 races\nis unheard of in previous years. The\nfemale soldier said, \"Don't forget\nsomeone finished one book on the first\nday of the newbie zone. If he keeps up\nhis pace, he might finish two books by\nnoon today.\" Dugu Jaolan was not blinded\nby passion, but calmly calculated\neverything. The female soldier said, \"Is\nit that Lin Shiao? Isn't he being\nwatched by Wong Su from the official\nserver?\" In a few days, he'll be forced\nto face the Black Flame Lord who's\nbreaking through the server. He doesn't\nhave the mind to rush to build a tier 2\nbase right now. It's a good thing that\nMiss asked me to go to such lengths to\nsearch for information for him. Dugu\nJaon asked in a nasal tone. Have you\nforgotten what I said last time? Oh,\nyou're being punished by standing guard\nevery night for a month, starting now.\nAs soon as Dugu Jalon finished speaking,\nthe female soldier walked out\ndejectedly. The Valkyrie simply watched\nthis scene with a smile. Marlenia, get\nsome rest tonight. If we really do get\nfirst place in the second tier, the\nbeast tide we face might be even fiercer\nthan the first one. This time, it all\ndepends on you. The Valkyrie smiled\nslightly. I will obey your orders, Lord.\nThe next morning, Lynsha had a good\nsleep and woke up slowly. The movement\nof getting up startled the beautiful\nwoman beside him. My lord, may I help\nyou change your clothes? No, no, I can\nput it on myself faster. Lyn Shiai\nrighteously rejected Ba and his\nunpretentious manner won Ba's favor once\nagain. In reality, he didn't want to be\nunable to suppress his desires first\nthing in the morning. Thinking of this,\nhe cursed inwardly again that the\nancient demons were truly despicable.\nopen the chat channel and see if there's\nanything new. Lynn Shia opened the chat\nchannel and as he expected, even in the\ndead of night, these idol new lords were\nall paying attention to every move in\nthe newbie zone. Throughout the night,\nnot a single player in any of the 10\nnewbie zones in the LN region\nsuccessfully upgraded to level two.\nHowever, there were countless reports of\npeople dying in battle or the Lord's\nMansion being destroyed by the demonic\ntide. The most discussed topic was Lin\nXiao's remote duel with Ding Lay in\nwhich Ding Lay with the beautiful girl\nwatching soloed the deaf knight in the\ndestruction castle during a live stream.\nDing Lay kept his promise and released\nthe beautiful girl which won him a lot\nof goodwill among the lords and brought\nhim a good reputation. The negative\nimpact of his previous failure to show\noff after being humiliated by Lynn,\nShiao has gradually disappeared. In\naddition to his good looks and\nformidable fighting ability, his current\npopularity is almost on par with Lin\nXiao's. Ding Lay is a man of his word.\nHe doesn't bully the weak and his\npromises are as good as gold. We and Lia\nneed someone like him. Dinglay has a\nbrighter future than Lin Sha. I'm\nwilling to follow Ding Lay. Whether Lin\nSha can handle the arrival of top\nexperts in the official server in a few\ndays is still a question. A big shot. I\nthink Lin Shiao is just a grasshopper in\nautumn. He won't be able to jump around\nfor long. What? Why do you have to look\ndown on boss Lyn Sha? Can you even\nhandle boss Lyn Xiao's phantom archer\nand Guster Archer? Exactly. If you only\nhad F-level talent, you'd be a sitting\nduck by now. If I had F ranklord talent,\nI wouldn't be showing off like this.\nMost of the onlookers had already\npredicted Lin Xiao's fate and began to\npraise Dinglay. Only a few people with\nlower innate lord level talents still\nsupported Lin Shiao and didn't want him\nto fail. The reason was simple. If\nLiao's F-level talent could reach such a\nlevel, their EDC talents might be just\nas good. Lyn Sha shook his head. He only\ntreated the chat channel content as a\nbit of fun. I gave you one night to get\na head start. Now it's my turn to\nupgrade to a second tier university. Lyn\nSha walked out of the Lord&lt;unk&gt;'s\nmansion and waved his hand. Upgrade\nLord's Mansion under upgrade. Upgrade\ncountdown 11 hours 59 minutes and 58\nseconds. Click to pause. Seeing that the\nLord's Manor was starting to upgrade,\nLynn Shiao checked the construction\norder of the various buildings in his\nterritory once again. If nothing\nunexpected happens, I should be able to\ncomplete the second level of the Lord's\nMansion tonight. Besides being able to\nrecruit a new hero immediately, I can\nalso immediately deploy barracks\nbuildings. Barracks buildings can\nrecruit existing troop types, which\nmeans you can recruit Emodo Dao iron\nguards and divine arm archers. Although\nI currently have five ordinary\nrecruitment tokens, those tokens require\nthe use of Chinese summoning to consume\nenergy in order to recruit Chinese\ntroops. According to the ancient demons\nusage techniques, the consumption of\nChinese energy would be even greater.\nSo, we should build barracks and\nmass-produce troops first and then use\nthe Chinese summoning system to\nreplenish our troops. At the same time,\nI can immediately construct hero\nspecific buildings. Recruiting rangers\nand songstresses. Well, songstresses are\nout of the question. It's not time to\nkeep playing music and dancing yet. I\nalready have a blacksmith shop. In\naddition, I need a war hall that can\nonly be built after reaching tier 2 as a\nplace for heroes to discuss military\naffairs in the future and also a\nbuilding for upgrading military supplies\nand equipment later. With this building,\nI've completed all the prerequisite\nbuildings for upgrading to tier three,\nthen immediately upgrade to level three.\nLyn Shia nodded and checked his\nresources. The barracks resources are\nmore than enough for the hero's\nexclusive buildings, more than enough\nfor the warh hall, more than enough\nresources. But the Lord's Manor is still\nshort of resources to upgrade to level\nthree. To summarize, the most lacking\nresources are refined wood, refined\nstone, refined iron, and refined copper.\nThese upgrade level mineral veins are\nrelatively rare. We could have\naccumulated enough resources by\ndestroying the castle, but\nunfortunately, Dinglay stumbled upon\nthem by accident. Secondly, there is a\nlack of rare mineral veins such as\ncrystal, gemstones, sulfur, and mercury.\nLyn Sha thought of something else.\nRecruiting ordinary troops in the\nbarracks only requires gold, coins, and\nfood. But starting from epic troops, you\nneed four rare mineral veins. Every epic\nunit requires one of the four rare\nresources. The legendary gold units will\nrequire even more. Although we don't\nknow what kind of minerals the iron\nguards and divine archers use, it's\ndefinitely a good idea to capture them\nall. Therefore, the four major upgrade\nmines and the four major rare resources\nare what I lack most right now. Opening\nthe map of his memories in his mind, Lyn\nSha immediately planned his route. The\nmatter was settled and Lyn Shao acted\nswiftly and decisively. Baoi will lead\n20 phantom archers to defend the base.\nThe rest of you follow me. Chapter 75.\nAbyss demon brands. Fully armed. Lin\nShiao wielding the holy sword. Falin led\npay mini\nsong Ruer Solin and others to conquer a\ncrystal mine. The reason he didn't\ndivide his forces was because he feared\nthe monsters guarding the four rare\nresources would be too powerful. For\nexample, this crystal mine is guarded by\na level 30 epic monster, the crystal\ndragon. Unafraid of magic, piercing, or\ncontrol, tireless with health points\nlonger than Bao sees legs, Lyn Sha would\nrather lead everyone to attack such a\nmonster with no weaknesses than lose one\nor two of his own troops. After several\nminutes of concentrated fire, the\ncrystal dragon let out a mournful cry\nturned into crystal shards and collapsed\nwith a crash. The flower fairies\nfollowing behind Lynn. Shiao immediately\nrushed forward and occupied the mine. He\nmy lord, you are so brave. Yao Yao wants\nto follow you into battle again. Flower\nfairies are fast and have good stamina,\nmaking them an excellent unit. I'm not\nleading them to kill enemies, but\nbecause they are much more durable than\npeasants. They can keep up with my\npowerful troops on a fast march, and\nthey are not afraid of death. They can\nalso protect themselves if they\nencounter powerful monsters during the\nmarch. The only problem is that he's too\nimpulsive. Occupy this crystal mine and\nmine it well. Farmers will naturally\ncome to take your place later. Lyn Sha\npatted the flower fair's head. Behave\nyourself or you can forget about going\nback to Heay's side. The flower fairy,\nhowever, squinted her eyes with\nenjoyment, flying around Lin Shiao and\nshowing off her graceful and nimble\nbody. He following the Lord isn't bad at\nall. Has the Lord ever tasted Yao Yao as\nhoney? It's very sweet. Lynn Shiao shook\nhis head and ignored him, leading his\ntroops to defeat another group of lava\ndwarf warriors and occupy a fine stone\nmine. These superior units are\nincredibly easy to obtain, but the\nproduction of spirit stones is too low.\nWe still need to continue conquering\nthem. I've already connected crystal\nmines, refined stones, refined wood,\nrefined iron, refined copper, sulfur\nmines, gemstone mines, and mercury mines\ninto one line, and I'll fight my way\nthrough. The main force continued\nforward, eliminating several other\nmonsters in the upgraded mines and\nsending out a few flower fairies to\noccupy and mine them. Within the\nterritory, farmhouses are constantly\nrecruiting golden legendary farmers.\nAfter each legendary farmer cultivates a\nlegendary farmland, he will be assigned\nto the mines occupied by various flower\nfairies where he will swing his pickaxe\nin a blur and work hard to mine. The\nnext rare resource mine is guarded by a\nlevel 30 epic creature, the Abyss Demon,\naccompanied by dozens of superior fire\nelves. The Abyss Demon was tall and\nimposing, exuding the oppressive aura of\nthe demon race. He had two twisted ram\nhorns on his head, one of which was\nbroken off. Strange. In my memory, the\nmonsters guarding this spot should be a\ngroup of hell nightmare beasts. Lyn Sha\nwas somewhat uncertain, so he checked\nthe attributes of the Abyss demon in\nadvance. Abyss demon brands, race high\ndemon, level 30, quality epic.\nAttributes: Strength 120, Spirit 60,\nConstitution 115, soul 40. Combat power\nrating 110 stars. Skills: Raging fire,\nblade of hatred, hate counterattack,\nendless hatred. The attributes are\npretty good. Plus, with the incredibly\nfast fire sprite, this sulfur mine will\nbe a bit challenging. The abyss demon\ncomes with a fire shield, making it\nimmune to mind magic and fire magic. It\nalso has high damage skills like the\nblade of hatred. Lynn Shiao didn't want\nto fight it himself. Pay Min. This abyss\ndemon is much stronger than the nest\ndemon. Go and teach him a lesson. Upon\nreceiving the order, Pay Min transformed\ninto a streak of sword light and slashed\nstraight down. Just kidding. When he was\nlevel one, the blade master dared to\ntake on a level 30 nest demon in a\none-on-one fight. Now that he's over\nlevel 10, even a stronger abyss demon\nwould have to avoid his attacks.\nPaymen's relentless attacks of one sword\nfrom the east and sacrifice to shatter\nmind. The abyss demon gradually\nsuccumbed. Lyn Shiao, also wearing the\nfourpiece scale rock set, led the other\ntroops and the fire spirits into battle.\nWith Payman's sword dao aura buff, Lin\nXiao's sword mastery reached a level,\nand he was able to wield the holy sword\nfalion with ease. Finally, the abyss\ndemon turned to ashes amidst its\nunwilling screams, and Lyn Sha led his\ntroops to kill all the fire spirits.\nIt's great that my little brother is\nstrong. We've taken over the sulfur\nmine. were still missing the gem and\nmercury mines. With the highdefinition\nmap of his memory palace, Lynn Sha\ndidn't need to explore and went straight\nto the gem mine. The gem mine is guarded\nby nearly a 100 elite scorpion lions.\nThe four rare mineral veins are all\nheavily guarded, and ordinary novice\nlords have no way to deal with them.\nFacing a 100 flying and poisonous lions,\nLynn Shia didn't waste any words. He\nactivated the skills of the divine\narcher and phantom archer, including\nlong shot, rapid fire, and sniping while\nthe iron guards of the Mod Dao blocked\nthe way. They quickly cleared out the\nmine and successfully captured it. It\nwas already noon, and the group was in\nthe wilderness roasting wild mutton and\nbeef and cooking some spirit rice\nporridge for their meal. Since acquiring\nthe legendary spirit rice, Lynn Shia has\nrequired all troop types to eat it every\nday. Each day, one of the four\nattributes will be randomly increased by\ntwo for Pay Min, whose base stats are\nhigh, but it's a significant boost for\nPhantom Archers, an excellent unit\nthat's only around 30 in all four stats,\neven at level 10 to 12. I really don't\nknow if I keep feeding him, the Phantom\nArcher will really turn into the Ancient\nArcher,\" Lyn Sha shook his head,\nstopping his wild thoughts. In the\nafternoon, the group continued to push\nthrough all the mineral veins and\nresources along the way and finally\narrived at their destination, the\nmercury mine. Upon arrival, they found\nanother abyssal demon leading dozens of\nfire spirits. I remember it being a\nroyal griffin. Never mind, we've already\nkilled this configuration once. Killing\nit again won't hurt. Lyn Shao continued\nto command Pay Min to fight the abyss\ndemon alone while he led his troops to\ncharge at the fire spirit. Just then,\nthe abyss demon raised its hand and a\nrain of meteors fell. Endless hatred\ndeals minor meteor shower damage to all\nenemies. With quick reflexes, Pay Min\nimmediately unleashed sword dance,\ntransforming into a streak of light to\nblock the meteor shower above Lin Sha\nand the phantom archer's heads. The iron\nguards with the emo dao sword and the\narchers with the divine arm archers\nstood still enduring the attack solely\nwith their heavy armor. This abyss demon\nis attacking first. Take him down. Pay\nmen rushed over immediately but the\nabyss demon waved his hand and the\nbroken giant sword wrapped in iron\nchains in his hand slashed down fiercely\nwith astonishing force. Hate\ncounterattack against enemies who have\nseverely harmed you. Counter-attack\ndamage is increased by 50%. Pay Min\ndodged the attack with surprise and\ncontinued to fight the abyss demon. Why\ndid you use the hate retaliation\ntechnique? Lyn Shiao asked in\nastonishment. Immediately, he sensed\nsomething was a miss. This abyss demon\nlooks almost exactly like the one that\nPay Min killed and turned to ashes in\nthe sulfur mine. Even the location of\nthe severed horn is the same. Pay Min,\nthis abyss demon might be from the\nsulfur mine. Be careful, Lynn Sha warned\nPay Min. No sooner said than done. In\nthe instant Lin Sha reminded Pay Min.\nMore than a hundred more demons suddenly\nburst out from between the cliffs and\nboulders behind Lin Shia and the others.\nThey pounced on the group. The devil was\nlying in ambush around the mercury mine,\nwaiting for Lin Sha. The ferocious\ndemon, the violent demon, the bone\ndemon, and the nest demon are all demons\nof excellent and epic quality. Human,\nhow dare you have any dealings with her\nhighness, the princess. Prepare to die.\nThe abyss demon roared and summoned a\nmeteor shower once more. Meteorites\nrained down from the sky, crashing down\non everyone, but Pay Min was facing the\nabyss demon and had no time to come to\ntheir aid. Chapter 76. The secrets\nexposed in Heizay's live stream. As the\nmeteor shower fell, the legendary\nunyielding units like the ironclad\nguards and the divine archers paid them\nno heat. But the phantom archer and the\nflower fairy are sure to suffer heavy\ncasualties. In the blink of an eye,\nLynsha swiftly raised his sword. The\nthought of may peace reign for all ages\nand may the sages continue their lost\nlearning suddenly activated in his mind.\nSubconsciously, Lyn Shao immediately\nrecalled Pay Min's swordsmanship from\nearlier, and the sword in his hand moved\nin sync with his body. Sword dance. Rank\nC activated. Lyn Sha twisted the holy\nsword falion into a flower shape, and\nstreams of sword energy swirled around\nit, forming a barrier of sword energy.\nBoom! The sword energy and the meteor\nshower collided, creating a series of\nloud explosions. Lyn Xiao's hastily\nexecuted sword dance actually blocked\nmost of the meteor shower. However,\nsince it was a sea level sword dance,\nsome meteor showers still managed to\nslip through the net and hit the team.\nSeveral screams were heard. Some phantom\narchers had already fallen to the\nground, and several flower fairies were\ninstantly killed and disappeared in\ngreen light. Hateful. Who the hell are\nyou? How dare you hurt my men? Lynsha\ncursed angrily and charged straight at\nthe demon lord. More than a hundred\ndemons that had been lying in ambush had\nalso rushed out. The Mod Dao iron guards\nand the divine arm archers quickly\norganized to resist them. They formed a\ncircle protecting the vulnerable phantom\narchers and flower fairies in the\ninnermost part. Faced with such a\nformidable foe, the iron guards of the\nMO Dao immediately activated their\npillar of strength and divine valor\nskills. Morale, strength, spirit,\nphysique, and health all surged\ninstantly. All attributes surpassed\nthose of a level 30 epic demon who\nwielded his broadsword and unleashed a\nbarrage of attacks with slash with the\nmomentum and slash against the momentum.\nThe entire ambush of the demon army was\nmomentarily stunned. Even the fiercest\nand most ferocious demons were shocked\nby the Mo Dao Iron Guards fearless and\nrelentless fighting style, which was\nalmost always critical hits. They were\nhit even if they blocked the attack, and\nthey were hit even if they didn't. The\nambush was greatly reduced in\neffectiveness. The divine archer, calm,\nand giant killer are about to follow up.\nComposure unaffected by ambushes or\nmental fear effects. When the enemy is\nless than 10 meters away from the\narcher, the archer's strength and\nconstitution attributes increase by 30%\nand melee ability increases by 30%.\nGiant slayer. The divine archer was all\na giant of their time. Facing any\ncreature larger than themselves, they\npossessed unique techniques to deliver\ncritical hits. critical hit rate\nincreased by 50% when attacking giants\nand the chance to hit a vital point\nincreased by 50%. The fierce demon and\nthe nest demon are enormous demons. So\nwhen the demons plan to launch a ranged\nattack, the archers with their giant\ncrossbows fired deadly bolts at the\ndemons vital organs such as their eyes,\nmouths, ears, hearts, and genitals. But\nwhen the demons charged toward the\narchers, they were not met with panicked\narchers who fled in terror, but with\nincomparably sharp ring pommel swords.\nThe demons suddenly realized that these\nranged attackers were no less capable in\nmelee combat than the armored warriors\nwielding giant swords next to them. A\nroar erupted as the demons and legendary\nunits clashed in a fierce battle.\nMeanwhile, Lynn Sha rushed to the front\nof the abyss demon and joined P men in\nfighting it. Just then, the announcement\nfrom the main god system resounded\nthroughout the entire region. Ding.\nDugu. Jaolon, a player from the Lan\nregion of Blue Star Realm, has\nsuccessfully upgraded to tier 2 and\nbecome the number one newbie lord in the\nLan region this year. System reward one,\nepic treasure chest. The long- aaited\nchat channel was quickly flooded with a\nlarge number of people. Wow, someone's\nalready at level two, and this is only\nthe third day since the server opened. I\nhaven't even finished upgrading one of\nmy books yet. Add one to the list\nupstairs. Haha, I just finished\nupgrading a book and recruited a rare\nhero. Damn, the demon tide is coming.\nI'm not saying anything more. The name\nDugu Jaolon sounds familiar, right?\nIsn't he the genius that Lynn Sha\nmentioned was the only one who could\nrival him in school? Dugu Jaolan took\nfirst place in the second tier, wasn't\nit? Lyn Sha, didn't Lyn Shiao when the\nfirst hero's move? Logically, he should\nhave had the first mover advantage. He\nSomeone scoffed. Don't forget Lyn Sha\nhas already been given a breakthrough\ntoken by a top player in the official\nzone, and he'll be coming to attack him\nin a few days. Yes, he's basically a\ndead man. The winning rate for all\nnewbies targeted by top players in the\nofficial zone is less than one in a\nthousand. The cold, hard data came out\nof this person's mouth, and the chat\nchannel fell silent for a moment. So,\nall we can do is let those of you with\npowerful connections bully and slaughter\nothers at will without allowing anyone\nto resist. A lord, also a commoner,\ncomplained indignantly. With a win rate\nof only one in a thousand, no wonder the\nlords of blue star are getting worse\nwith each generation. As long as you\nhave powerful backers, you can act\narrogantly and doineeringly, and no one\ndares to offend you. All the true\ngeniuses on Earth have been stifled and\nkilled by these second generation\nleaders and people with powerful\nbackers. The commoner lord's words of\ngrief and indignation did not elicit\nagreement, but rather a chorus of\nridicule. Huh? You call an F-level\ntalented genius. Exactly. If he were a\ntrue genius, a whole host of powerful\nforces would have invited him as an\nhonored guest and placed him under\nstrict protection. Understand? Look at\nDinglay. He suddenly has over a hundred\ndifferent types of troops. He must have\njoined a major power. Does Lin Sha have\nthat? I'm new here and don't know Lynn\nShiao, but I think it's already amazing\nthat Lynn Shiao with his F- level lord\ntalent managed to get first place once.\nHe's a genius. Everyone, pretty girl,\nstop pretending to Shan by Chian. How\ncome you all know it's me even though I\nhid my ID? He who was standing to the\nside also wanted to jump out and say a\nfew words in rebuttal. I'll just forget\nabout it. Master Lin Shiao is a hidden\nmaster far beyond your comprehension. He\nmust have his reasons for not rushing to\nupgrade to a second tier university. The\nmore I thought about it, the angrier I\ngot. He still opened the chat channel.\nHe a what are you all babbling about?\nLyn Shia is much stronger than everyone\nhere. Even if he's not number one, he's\ndefinitely number two. Ding. Player\nJulie from the LN region of Blueest Star\nrealm has successfully upgraded to tier\n2, becoming the second ranked newbie\nlord in the Lan region this year. System\nreward one epic treasure chest. Eay,\nforget it. Lyn Shiao has always been\nlow-key and doesn't like to show off.\nUnlike Ding Lay, who always has to come\nout and flaunt his presence, you need to\nhave some faith in your lord. By the\nway, I'm also planning to upgrade to a\nhigher level. I should let Lin Sha know\nand find out what he thinks. With that\nin mind, Hay dialed Lin Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s\nnumber. After waiting for half a minute\nwithout Lin Shiao answering, Hay dialed\nagain and out of boredom open the chat\nchannel again. Dinglay he everyone. I'm\nnot very talented, but I've already\nstarted upgrading to a second tier\nuniversity. If all goes well, I should\nbe able to complete the upgrade by\ntomorrow morning. What? Tomorrow\nmorning? upgrade to a second tier\nuniversity on the fourth day. Wow, Ding\nLay is awesome. Ding Lay could\ndefinitely break into the top 10. Hara,\nDing Lay is the real boss. Lynn Shiao\nhas definitely fallen behind and will\nnever be able to catch up with Ding Lay.\nLyn Sha is useless now. I heard he took\nin a few vassel lords. Apart from the\npretty girls, the rest of them are\ntrash. He'll even collect garbage. He\nmust be desperate. You guys praise\nDinglay. I'll tolerate that. You smear\nLin Shia. I'll tolerate that, too. But\nwhy call me trash? He immediately jumped\nout. Who's trash? Who's trash? How am I\nHe trash? Everyone, so you're also a\nvassal lord of Lyn Shia. I knew it. He's\ntrash. He shut up. I'm almost at level\none. My speed is above average in this\nnewbie zone. Dinglay. Not bad. He\nDinglay, I don't need your approval.\nDinglay, don't underestimate anyone.\nLook at Heay. Although he doesn't look\nimpressive, he was almost wiped out by\nXiao Daong, but now he's about to be\npromoted to a higher level. Everyone\nshould learn from him. Everyone, Dinglay\nis indeed magnanimous, but we don't know\nif he is lying or not. Dinglay, I\nbelieve in Heay. Everyone, we don't\nbelieve it. Heay, don't believe me? I'll\ngo live and show you. Ding. Contestant\nHeay has created a live stream room. In\nan instant, thousands of people flooded\ninto the live stream. Heay said to the\nLord's mansion that he was about to\ncomplete. Look, look, the Lord's manor\nis almost lit up. Am I lying? Just then,\nLyn Xiao's call, which he had been\ndialing, was finally connected. Everyone\nsaw the communication interface between\nLin Shiao and Heay. Lyn Sha stood on a\ngiant abyss demon. One hand gripping the\ndemon's horns, the other fist raining\ndown on the demon's eye sockets. What\ndid you say? Say it again. Who slept\nwith your princess? Chapter 77. A real\nman should. The audience in the live\nstream was stunned. How did I end up\nseeing such a shocking scene while\nwatching a newbie's live stream trying\nto prove his innocence? Abyss demon.\nAppearing in the newbie zone is like\nbeing a nest demon with a minimum level\nof 30. Incomparably powerful and\nbloodthirsty. Lyn Sha, although his lord\ntalent is f, he's a very popular ranger\nlord lately. Some say he's mysterious\nwhile others say he's just being\ndeliberately enigmatic. But at this\nmoment, it was Lynn Sha riding on the\nabyss demon and beating it up. The live\nstream all gasped, recalling the fear\nthey felt when Lyn Shao calmly and\neffortlessly crushed Xiao Data. Lyn\nShia, his fists clad in iron gauntlets,\nslammed repeatedly into the abyss\ndemon's head, shouting, \"Say that again\nif you dare.\" The abyss demon struggled\nincessantly, but Lyn Sha held it down\nfirmly. It opened its massive m. But\nbefore the sulfurous flames could form,\nLyn Sha shattered them with a single\npunch. You have the aura of our\nprincess. The abyss demon roared. Your\nscent lingers in the princess's body.\nGrasp. Lynsha swore again. He felt\nincredibly wronged. He was still a\nvirgin in both his past and present\nlives. Yet he was falsely accused of\nindecent assault by a demon. Where could\nhe go to seek justice? You lie\nagain. Who the hell would go after\nmonsters like you for no reason? Do you\nhave such a heavy taste? And how did you\nknow the scent inside your princess's\nbody? The demon of the abyss paused.\nThen with a flick of his only movable\nfinger, the flames conjured an image.\nThis is our princess. The person in the\ncenter of the image has seductive eyes,\nfiery red lips, and snow white skin with\ntwo small devil horns on her head. Her\nfeatures are soft and gentle without any\naggression, making people want to\ncherish her at first glance. Yet, her\nfigure is stunningly good, making people\nwant to possess her at first sight. It\nalso has a pair of small wings and a\ntail. She was one of the succubi who\nappeared during the demon tide. Lynsha\npaused for a moment. That's a good idea.\nThen he shook his head and roared. That\ndevil, what does she have to do with me?\nI'm still looking for her. Tell me,\nwhere is she? She's caused me so much\ntrouble. He had only exchanged a glance\nwith this succubus and was instantly\nmarked with a magical symbol. If the\nsuccubus hadn't transmitted an image of\nthe mark back, he wouldn't have been\ndetected by the ancient demon just as he\nwas about to have sex with Ba, his\nperiod triggered the explosion. Now with\ndesire burning fiercely, I can only\nendure it every day. The live stream\nroom fell silent and everyone gasped in\nshock. Lyn Sha actually has an ambiguous\nrelationship with the succubus princess.\nEven Heay stood there dumbfounded,\ncompletely forgetting that his lord's\nmanner had already been upgraded. The\nabyss demon refused to speak further and\nsuddenly struggled desperately, arching\nits back and throwing Lin Sha aside.\nSeeing the demon about to escape, Lyn\nSha coldly waved his hand. Whoosh!\nDozens of arrows flew past Lyn Sha from\nbehind and struck the demon. The demon\nlet out a miserable scream and turned to\nashes. Only the dead can escape from me.\nAt this moment, Lyn Shao slowly turned\naround, his hands behind his back, and\ncoldly looked at Heay. He&lt;unk&gt; been\nlooking for me in a hurry. What's wrong?\nBrother Lyn Sha, I'm so sorry. I'm so\nsorry. I saw something I shouldn't have\nseen. I was going to tell you that I'm\nabout to be upgraded to a higher level.\nEay said guilty. You're not going to be\nupgraded to a first tier university\nright away. You're already at the first\ntier university. Lynsha said calmly. How\ndid boss Lyn Sha know? The demonic tide\nis about to attack your lord's manor. Oh\ncrap, I forgot about that. He hurriedly\nhung up the communication and led the\nflower fairy to fight back against the\ndemon tide. The chat channel here\nexploded once again. Holy crap. Did you\nguys just go to Heay's live stream? Lyn\nSha smashed a level 30 epic abyss demon\nwith his bare hands. Really? Is that so?\nSeriously, I saw it, too. Lyn Shia is\npractically the ceiling of combat power\nin the newbie zone. Damn. Lyn Shia is\nonly a level 10, but he dares to go and\nfight the abyss demon. He's a real man.\nI'm a fan now. And there's something\neven more shocking. Do you know what the\nabyss demon said? What did you say? Lyn\nSha slept with their princess. What? Lyn\nSha has such heavy tastes. How could he\ndo this? Wow. Oh, what a true hero. Real\nmen should fight demons, dragons, and\nbehemoths. I'm a fan now, everyone. Just\nas everyone was discussing the amazing\nscene they had just witnessed within\nDistrict 9527,\nsword come. Dugu Jaon stretched out her\nright hand, and the Thai sword flew\nstraight into her hand like lightning.\nThe sword was stained with blood, which\nhad not yet dried. Congratulations,\nLord. You have successfully defeated the\nsecond wave of beasts. With a swift,\nsweeping waterbird attack, Marlenia also\nkilled the last few dozen screaming\nelite goblin warriors. Dugu Jalon\nnodded, but there wasn't much excitement\non his face. This first place came very\nwell, but it came too easily. Lyn Sha,\nwhat's wrong with you? Why didn't you go\nfirst than me this time? Dugu Jaalon,\nwhose entire academic career had been\ndominated by Lin Shiao, finally defeated\nLin Sha, but felt it was somewhat\nunreal. Is it because you're preparing\nfor the invasion and annihilation that\nyour speed has been affected? Should we\nask Chufinga later if we should give him\nsome more help? He's such a proud\nperson, he probably won't accept charity\nfrom others. At the same time, in the\nofficial district, a man with a large\nhooked nose and a thick beard visited a\nhuge, spacious lord's mansion filled\nwith a sacred atmosphere. My lord, your\nprediction is wrong, Lynn shouted, \"Not\nwhen first place this time. Instead, it\nwas a woman named Dugu from the 9527\nnewbie zone. He didn't even get second\nplace. It doesn't matter. This shows\nthat he has collapsed under this\npressure and can't even keep his own\nadvantages. A deep, steady male voice\nrang out. It was the man in the floral\nshirt whom Wong Su referred to as the\nadult. I gave him such great respect,\nyet I was deeply disappointed. Let Black\nFlame take the legendary and epic units.\nBring 1,000 of them. This time, we'll\nshow everyone our power with an\noverwhelming force. Yes, sir. The\nhook-nosed man bowed and replied. The\nman in the floral shirt stood up and\nwaved his hand dismissively. Get out of\nhere. Don't bother me unless it's\nabsolutely necessary. Wongu immediately\nretreated respectfully. As he retreated\nto the doorway, he saw the man in the\nfloral shirt naturally place his hand on\nAngel's waist and lead her towards the\nbedroom. Is this in broad daylight?\nEnvy, jealousy, resentment, and greed\nflashed across Wong Su&lt;unk&gt;s eyes,\nforming a complex expression. Having\neliminated all the monsters guarding the\nMercury mine, immediately began to\nassess his losses. Three phantom archers\nwere seriously injured and two were\nslightly injured. Seven flower fairies\nwere instantly killed. This level 30\nabyss demon is not much weaker than a\nlegendary fire demon. If any other lord\nencountered it, they would basically\nnever return. Just now, sword saint\npaymin acted as the main force, directly\npiercing the demons several times. Only\nwith Pay Min's protection was Lin Shia,\na level 10 player, able to beat the\nabyss demon. The demons actually set up\nan ambush for me. I've never heard of\nsuch a thing before. What happened to\nme? How did I become their princess? I'm\nwondering about that myself. All right,\nlet's hurry back. Healing Phantom Archer\nis the priority. Also, tell Heay to come\nover when he has time and revive the\nflower fairy. Then I'll upgrade directly\nto tier 2 and recruit my third Chinese\nhero. Chapter 78, limited recruitment,\nnew heroes of China. Lyn Sha arrived at\nthe Lord's Mansion, and it was already\nquite late. The wounded Phantom Archer\nwas immediately settled down. The\nlegendary Lord's Mansion's healing\nfunction could slowly heal the injuries,\nlarge and small, suffered by various\nunits in the Battle of the Myriad Races.\nAfter a long day, everyone sat down\nimmediately. It was said that the\nfarmers had prepared spirit rice\nporridge and roasted meat in advance and\nserved them to everyone. Ba came forward\nand personally sliced the roasted meat\ninto pieces for Lin Sha, feeding it to\nhim. Such intimate gestures are\nperfectly natural in front of others. A\nlord's spouse should be sweet and loving\nwith their lord. This is the powerful\nimpact of Ba's alluring beauty skill.\nWhile chewing on roasted meat, Lynn Shia\nchecked the progress of the Lord's\nmanor. Check the upgrade progress of the\nLord's Mansion. Lord's Mansion under\nupgrade. Upgrade countdown. 1 hour 22\nminutes and 5 seconds. Great. The second\ntier university is about to be upgraded.\nThat's fast. Dugu Jalon took first place\nthis time, so it's good that the good\nstuff doesn't go to outsiders. Although\nthe class monitor doesn't know whether\nhe's considered an outsider or not,\nLynsha estimated that he should have no\nproblem getting into the top 10. After\nall the troops had eaten and drunk their\nfill, Lyn Sha waited for the Lord's\nmansion to be upgraded and then checked\nhis resources for a while. I have a lot\nof experience. I've reached over 8\nmillion again, and I'm saving it all for\nthe second tier heroes as well as the\nChinese troops recruited from the\nbarracks. I can't make the mistake of\nforgetting to upgrade people again. This\ntime, Lyn Sha still has five ordinary\nrecruitment tokens. He can use the Hasha\nsummoning function to directly summon\nthe Hashia golden legendary unit. The\nprerequisite is that the battlefield of\nall races has enough energy. He then\nchecked the energy levels of the\nbattlefield of myriad races, 9,670\npoints. He sighed inwardly. His\nexperience points were rising rapidly as\nwere his gold coins and mineral\nresources. However, battlefield energy\nis becoming increasingly scarce.\nSometimes killing three or five elite or\nrare monsters is required to obtain just\none point of battlefield energy, while\nkilling ordinary monsters is even rarer,\nyielding only one point of energy per\n100 monsters. However, using the Hashia\ntoken usage secrets taught by the\nancient demon requires a massive amount\nof battlefield energy from all races.\nDid those three shadowy figures lower\nthe drop rate? Is it because I secretly\ncursed them every day because of Baoi?\nLyn Sha thought to himself without\nthinking. We should take a look at how\nmany other people besides Dugu Jaolan\nhave successfully entered a second tier\nuniversity. Lyn Shao thought to himself\nand then casually opened the chat\nchannel. Upon seeing this, Lyn\nXiao&lt;unk&gt;s expression gradually became\nblank and speechless. The chat channel\nwas filled with the untold secret\nbetween Lin Shia and the succubus\nprincess. Lyn Sha forced himself on a\nsuccubus only to be relentlessly pursued\nby the abyssal demon he had been wronged\nby. Lyn Sha single-handedly crushes the\nabyss demon. Lyn Shia was able to get\nfirst place because he had connections\nwith the demon race. Lyn Sha is the top\ntier fighter in single player challenges\nin the 89757\nnewbie zone. Who can disagree the hell\nis going on? Lyn Shia continued\nscrolling through the chat history and\nfinally figured out what had happened.\nIt turned out that Dugu Jaolan had\nupgraded to the second tier university\nbefore him which sparked a heated\ndiscussion in the chat channel. Then Tan\nby Chian and Heay both failed to speak\nup for themselves. While dialing his own\nnumber, Heay was also provoked by Ding\nLelay and started a live stream. His\nbeating of the abyss demon and is being\nslandered by the demon were thus\nexposed. No wonder Heay's reaction was\nso unnatural. He a brainless idiot too.\nLyn Shiao said angrily. Just then, Heay\ndialed Lin Xiao's number again. Once the\ncall connected, Hay on the other end\nknew from Linhao&lt;unk&gt;s expression that\nhis scheme had been exposed. Boss Lin\nShiao, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to. I\nwas afraid of disturbing boss Lin\nXiao&lt;unk&gt;s monster hunting, so I only\ndared to tell Boss Lin Shia at night.\nI'm willing to accept the punishment.\nHumph. Lyn Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s face was so dark\nit looked like ink was about to drip\nfrom it. You've already got a whole\nbook. How many flower fairies do you\nhave now? Not many. Not many. Just 80.\nso far, Eay said repeatedly. Mainly\nbecause a few of the leader talismans\nwere obtained, so I bought two more.\nSend over another 30 flower fairies\ntomorrow. They have to be just blooming.\nCough, cough. Just budding, Lyn Sha said\nwith a dark face. Also, seven flower\nfairies died today. Come and revive them\ntomorrow. I'll let you off this time\nbecause you meant well. I don't need\nanyone's approval. I just need to be\nstrong myself. Think before you speak\nnext time, and don't expose my secrets\nagain. Otherwise, you won't be able to\nkeep your flower fairy form. Okay. Okay.\nHeay breathed a sigh of relief, glanced\nat Lynn Sha, and seeing that he didn't\nseem to be genuinely pursuing the\nmatter, he couldn't help but say, \"Boss\nLyn Sha, um, you really took the demon\nprincess roll.\" It was already 8:00 p.m.\nwhen he was driven away. Lynn Sha\nconfirmed that only five people had\ncompleted the second tier upgrade while\nhis own lord's manner would be upgraded\nin a few minutes. Finally, finally\nfinished. Pay men waiting quietly beside\nhim. Further back were rows of neatly\narranged moa soldiers, divine arm\narchers, and phantom archers. At the\nvery back were the farmers and flower\nfairies resting, some sitting and some\nstanding. Their postures relaxed, but\ntheir expressions carrying a hint of\ntension. Everyone was waiting for this\nmoment. Ding. Lynn Sha, a player from\nthe Lan region of the blue star realm,\nhas successfully upgraded to tier 2 and\nbecome the sixth ranked rookie lord in\nthe Lan region this year. System reward\none excellent treasure chest. The\nfinally sounded. Congratulations, Lord.\nThe unified shouts resounded throughout\nthe territory. This was the cohesion\nunder Lin Xiao's rule. Everyone, let's\nbegin. Lynn Shiao stood up and without\nany hesitation immediately began the\noperation. Build barracks. The two\nlegendary farmers immediately built two\nmilitary camps at the location\ndesignated by Lyn Shiao. That's right.\nLynho's resources are even enough to\nsupport the simultaneous construction of\ntwo barracks. Barracks under\nconstruction. Construction countdown. 23\nto pause. Build a war hall. According to\na legend, the farmers immediately began\nworking. Warh Hall under construction.\nVery good. By this time tomorrow night,\nthe barracks and war hall will be\ncompleted. Lynn Shia nodded in\nsatisfaction. Next, construct the sword\nSt. Pay Min's exclusive hero building,\nthe Rangers Pavilion. Three more\nlegendary farmers went to the designated\nlocation and began building the wanderer\npavilion. As a building exclusive to\nheroes, it can recruit heroes exclusive\nunits. The legendary pay men recruited\nlegendary wandering knights. However,\nhero specific buildings require more\nfarmers and take a long time to build.\nWandering swordsman pavilion under\nconstruction. Construction countdown 47\nto pause. Even with the eternal peace\nacceleration at 100%, the wanderer's\npavilion will still take 2 days to\ncomplete. Hero exclusive buildings are\njust a bit more difficult than other\nbuildings. Lyn Sha nodded. The demon\ntide is about to arrive, so we need to\nstart recruiting heroes from tier 2\nimmediately. Who could it be? Lyn Sha\nsuppressed his excitement. Exchange for\nHuasha token energy. Consume one energy\npoint to use the Hasha token. Hasha\nsummoning function to summon a Hasha\nhero. Hua immediately deducts 1,000\nbattlefield energy points. Then Lynn\nShao continued, \"Continue to consume the\nenergy of the battlefield of myriad\nraces and set the conditions for this\nHasha summoning. Requirement one,\nrecruit general type commander heroes.\nRequirement two, proficient in mountain\nwarfare.\" A flash of seven colored light\nappeared and a portal appeared in the\nterritory. A figure slowly appeared and\nstepped out of the portal. Lyn Sha and\nthe others eyes lit up. Chapter 79. Chin\nLeang Yu, the great Ming Dynasty's\nfemale war goddess, makes her debut. A\nportal flashed and a tall figure stepped\nout. She wore a scale patterned soft\narmor with a bright red cape flowing\nbehind her and her long hair was tied\ninto a high ponytail that reached her\nwaist. She was actually a female\ngeneral. She has delicate features, a\nsmall rosy mouth and a high nose that\naccentuates the three-dimensionality of\nher features. Her face, eyes, eyebrows,\nnose, and mouth are all extremely\nbeautiful. But when combined, they\nreveal a vigorous and heroic spirit that\nmakes people overlook her beauty and\nonly feel that she is irresistible.\nHolding a helmet in her left hand and a\ngleaming white rifle in her right, she\nlooked incredibly heroic, like a\ndignified female warrior. Ding!\nhero, Shin Lang Yu. It's her. Lyn\nXiao&lt;unk&gt;s heart skipped a beat. He\nhadn't expected it to be Chin Leong Yu.\nShe is the only woman in China's\nthousands of years of history who is\nrecorded in official histories and the\nonly one recorded in the biographies of\ngenerals. Chin Leang Yu, a female war\ngoddess who was enabled and appointed\ngrand protector for her military\nachievements. Lyn Ziao&lt;unk&gt;s eyes lit up\ninstantly. His unpleasantness at having\n4,000 energy points deducted from his\naccount when he used the Hasha token\nvanished instantly. Hasa summoning\nallows you to summon the heroes you want\nor need within a certain range subject\nto certain conditions. In Lin Xiao's\nmind, the second shadowy figure cackled\nwickedly. If you set enough conditions,\nyou can even recruit any hero. However,\nthe more conditions there are, the more\nbattlefield energy is consumed. He in\norder to deal with this crisis, Lynn\nShiao decided to use the ancient demons\ntricks to summon a Chinese hero who was\nsuitable for him. Since it was his first\ntime using it, Lynn Shia didn't dare to\nbe greedy and only specified two\nconditions. First, the general type\nhero. Otherwise, if we send out a Daji,\nShishure, or Xiao Chan, not to mention\nwhether they have magic or what their\nabilities are. Just the fact that we\nonly have two enchantresses among our\nthree heroes would probably leave us\nwith no energy to deal with black flame.\nSecond, they excel at mountain warfare.\nBecause his territory was located in the\nmountains, and the lord's mansion was\nsituated at the mouth of the gourd\nmountain, the general who fought in the\nmountains could fully display his\ntalents. As it turns out, the extra\n4,000 points of Hashia energy were well\nspent. And she's a beautiful heroine,\ntoo. What a steal. Lynh Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s eyes\nnarrowed into slits as he smiled at the\nfemale general in front of him. Just\nthen, the female general finished\nreceiving the information from the main\ngod system. She looked up and saw a\nhandsome and dashing young man\nsurrounded by people smiling at her. The\nfemale general's pretty face flushed\nslightly, and she quickly stepped\nforward and clasped her hands in a fist\nsalute. This humble general, Chin\nLeangu, greets your lordship. The\ndashing chin Lean Yu was tall, almost as\ntall as Lin Shao. No need for\nformalities. Lean Yu, I have long\nawaited your arrival. Are you willing to\nfollow me, to conquer the world with me,\nto annihilate foreign races, to kill\nalien species, and to spread the glory\nof China? I am deeply grateful for your\nkindness, Lord. Chin Leon Yu knelt on\none knee, displaying a completely\nmilitary bearing. Lean Yu will surely\ndie on the battlefield loyal to the\nLord. Ding! Your hero Chin Lean Yu&lt;unk&gt;s\nloyalty has reached 90%. Do whatever you\nwant. Lyn Sha was stunned. What kind of\noperation is this? Lyn Sha thought to\nhimself, \"Is this girl so easily loyal\nto her master?\" Chin Leang Yu&lt;unk&gt;s\nloyalty level reached 90 so quickly,\nwhich is both good news and bad news.\nThe loyalty template used is the female\ntemplate. So, the main god system\nintroduction includes a do whatever you\nwant judgment. The bad news is, if I\nremember correctly, Chin Leong Yu was a\nmarried woman. Lynn Shiao, who had been\nlost in thought, quickly regained his\nsenses and hurriedly helped Chin Leong\nYu up, saying, \"I told you there's no\nneed for such formalities, Leon Yu. From\nnow on, this is your home.\" He thought\nto himself, \"Check Chin Leong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s\nattributes. Then he carefully examined\nChin Lean Yu. Chin Leong Yu race human\nmeow ethnic group quality golden legend\nlevel level one attributes strength 48 +\n10 spirit 60 + 12 constitution 50 + 10\nsoul 50 + 10 skills to chieftain woman\nof strength queen of the mountains\nmaster of spears spearman command s rank\narcher command sr rank command of all\ntroop types a rank\nCombat power rating 55 stars. Exclusive\nunit, white-shaped spearman. Excellent.\nTruly excellent. Worthy of being called\na general and a hero. Comes with three\ncommanders: spearmen, archers, and all\nunit types. Both spearmen and archers\nare S-rank commanders. This means that\nall spearmen and archers will receive a\n50% bonus to all attributes as long as\nthey are near Chin Leong Yu. The A-level\nall troop command grants a 30% bonus to\nall stats of all troop types except\nspearmen and archers. These three skills\nalone are enough for a legendary hero to\ndominate the battlefield of the myriad\nraces. Not to mention, Chin Leong Yu has\nthree other skills with impressive\nnames. Although Chin Leong Yu's personal\ncombat ability is inferior to Pay Min's,\nPay Min had a rating of 61 stars when he\nwas at level one, while Chin Leong Yu\nonly had 55 stars. However, Chin Leong\nYu&lt;unk&gt;s attributes still far surpass\nthose of other legendary gold tier units\nof the same level, such as the MO Dao\nIron Guard and the Divine Arm Archer.\nJust kidding. There's no such thing as a\nbad legendary hero, Lyn Sha thought to\nhimself. These two heroes are not the\nsame type. None of Payman's skills are\nrelated to command. At most, he has a\nsword aura that provides a buff to\nfriendly units who use swords. However,\nPayman himself has unparalleled attack\npower, and his attack, defense, and\nspeed are all exceptional. He dares to\nkill level 30 epic monsters at level\none. Chin Leang Yu is a true general\ntype hero, but her personal strength is\nnot as great as payments, and her skills\nare not for one-on-one combat. The only\nskill that comes close is master of\nspears. However, she has S-level bonuses\nfor spearman and archers, a level\nbonuses for other troop types, and\nspecial skills like chieftain and king\nof the mountains that provide high\nbonuses under certain circumstances.\nJust as Lin Sha was carefully examining\nChin Leong Yu, Chin Leang Yu was also\nsecretly watching him. There was no\nother reason than that the man in front\nof him was simply too handsome. His\nfacial features were practically\nperfect, possessing both masculine\nstrength and a captivatingly gentle\nsmile. His eyes were bright and\npiercing, and the curve and shape of his\nlips were just right. He was arguably\nthe most handsome man Sheen Leonu had\never seen in her life. heart began to\nbeat faster after just one glance. Good\njade. Hearing Lynn Sha call her name,\nShin Liong Yu finally reacted and\nquickly clasped her hands in greeting,\nsaying, \"Your subordinate is here.\nYou're new here. I should have given you\na welcome feast.\" Lyn Shao said gently.\n\"But the beast tide is coming soon, so\nlet's&lt;unk&gt; fight it first, and then we\ncan drink and celebrate. Your\nsubordinate obeys.\" With a wave of his\nhand, Lin Shiao instantly upgraded Chin\nLeong Yu to level 10. Her personal\nattributes directly changed to\nattributes strength 88 + 17, spirit 110\n+ 22, constitution 80 + 16, soul 70 +\n14. Combat power rating 99 stars. Thank\nyou very much, my lord. Chin Leang\nYu&lt;unk&gt;s gratitude was evident in her\nwords. My lord, you level me up 10\nlevels the moment we met. You're really\nkind to me. At that moment, the\ncentury's rough shouts could be heard\nfrom afar at the territo's perimeter\nwall. Enemy attack. Demonic tide is\ncoming. The soldiers suddenly turned\naround and headed towards the territory\ngate in an orderly manner. Chin Lean Yu\nwas about to set off, but Lyn Shao\nreached out and stopped her. Lyn Shao,\nLeon Yu, as a general, how can you come\nto this battlefield of 10,000 races\nwithout your own personal guards? Lyn\nSha took out two ordinary recruitment\ntokens and waved his hand. Use Hasha\nsummoning to consume the energy of the\nmyriad races battlefield and summoned\nthe Hashia exclusive unit, the\nwhite-shaped spearman. Chapter 80. The\nbloodthirsty White Spear soldiers make\ntheir debut. Recruitment tokens were\noriginally only used to summon troops of\na certain level. One recruitment token\ncould summon 10 troops. If you have two\nrecruitment tokens, last time you\nrecruited human armored infantry, the\nnext time you might recruit elven\narchers, both are rare unit types, but\nyou can't just recruit whichever you\nwant. immediately used the Hasha token\nto upgrade the few recruitment tokens in\nhis hand and summoned the Hashia golden\nlegendary troops because he knew that\nhis strength was not strong enough. If\nhe summoned six or seven different\nChinese troops, each with 10 people, he\nwould not know how to use them and would\nnot be able to bring out the maximum\nability of each type of troop. Not to\nmention, he would waste the recruitment\ntokens for no reason and lose the\nadvantage of making the Chinese troops\nfight in large groups. 10 Mod Dao iron\nguards are already very strong, but\n1,000 MOA iron guards are even more\ninvincible. Fortunately, the ancient\ndemon told him the trick. Similar to\nrecruiting heroes under certain\nconditions in China, summoned units can\nalso be summoned by designation. In the\nsimplest case, when a lord has a certain\ntype of unit, or when the lord's hero\nhas a unit that is exclusive to a\ncertain type of unit, the lord can\ndirectly consume more energy to perform\na targeted summon, summoning a unit of\nthe same type. As Linhao's voice fell,\nthe two recruitment tokens rose directly\ninto the sky, eventually becoming golden\ntalismans engraved with auspicious\nfive-ccoled clouds and adorned with\nmythical beast patterns at the bottom.\nThe portal roared, and two groups of\nfigures emerged from it. This group of\npeople all carried 4 m long white\nshafted spears, had heavy swords hanging\nat their waists, wore iron-faced\nbreastplates, and had two muscular arms\nexposed, exuding a murderous aura. They\nweren't as tall and muscular as the Emo\nDao iron guards or the divine arm\narchers, who were nearly 2 m tall, but\nthey were still tough men over 1.8\nmeters tall. Their skin was dark and\nsome of their facial features and eye\ncolor differed slightly from those of\nthe Hanchinese. They were actually an\narmy composed of a mixture of ethnic\nminorities and Hanchinese. The\nwhite-clad soldiers armor did not cover\ntheir entire bodies, only their upper\nbodies and shoulders. They wore gators\nto protect their shins and gauntlets to\nprotect their forearms, making them\nsomewhat resemble the Spartan hoplights\nof ancient Greece. Check the attributes\nof the white-shaped spearman. White\nSpearman Magua Jong. Race: Human,\nChinese minority. Level one. Quality:\nLegend. Attributes: Strength: 28 + 20.\nSpirit 35 + 25. Constitution 32 + 23,\nsoul 10 + 7. Combat power rating 30\nstars. Attributes added by skills,\nequipment, lord abilities, etc. are not\nincluded in the combat power rating.\nskills. Bloodlust, death combat,\nbarbarian warrior, intimidation, son of\nthe mountain. The unit with the highest\nspirit stat at level one that has been\nrecruited so far, Lynsha nodded. It was\nprecisely because of Lin Xiao's limited\nrecruitment that an additional 2,000\nbattlefield energy were consumed,\nleaving only a little over 600\nbattlefield energy. The 20 fierce white\npole soldiers from the stone pillars\nreceived the information that the main\ngods battlefield had been completed and\nthey all walked towards Lin Shiao\nkneeling on one knee. Greetings your\nlordship. No need for such formalities.\nThe white spear spearman rose faced Chin\nLeong Yu and saluted again. Greetings\nmadam. Chin Leongyu nodded and said on\nthe battlefield you must call me general\nand you must not call me madam anymore.\nYes, sir. Lynn Sha waved his hand.\nUpgrade everything to level 10. 20 White\nSpear soldiers were instantly upgraded\nto level 10, their experience points\nwiped out. But the White Spear soldiers\nimmediately gained powerful attributes\nand could be deployed to the battlefield\nright away. Attributes strength 60 + 42\nspirit 85 + 58 constitution 72 + 50 soul\n30 + 21 combat power rating 79 stars.\nLynn Sha nodded in satisfaction. It was\na standard golden legendary panel. The\nreason why the white spear soldiers have\nso many attributes in parenthesis is\nbecause Chin Leongu's s level spearman\ncommand increases all attributes by 50%.\nAnd Lyn Xiao's eternal peace increases\nall attributes by 20%. My lord, the\nbeast tide has been going on for several\nminutes. I am terrified and am willing\nto lead the troops to resist it\nimmediately. Okay, go ahead. After\nsaying this, Chin Leong Yu quickly\napologized to Lin Shiao and led 20 White\nSpear soldiers towards the gate of the\nLord&lt;unk&gt;'s mansion. Seeing Chin Leong\nYu lead her troops away, Lyn Sha could\nonly smile bitterly to himself. Chin\nLeang Yu was indeed a married woman.\nCould it be that I, the Lord, am about\nto engage in an NTR scene right before\neveryone's eyes? I'm a pure lord. This\nmust be because of Heay's influence. Lyn\nShao shook his head with a formidable\nenemy at hand. What am I thinking? And\nhe hasn't even won over his own\nconcubine, Ba yet. Hey, where's Ba? Lyn\nSha looked left and right, but couldn't\nsee Ba, and a sense of doubt arose in\nhis heart. But time was of the essence,\nand he didn't have time to search. So,\nhe also headed towards the territory\ngate. Here, a few minutes before Lyn\nShao successfully upgraded the Lord's\nmansion. in the chat channel. The untold\nstory about Lin Shia and the Succubus\nPrincess had just come to an end.\nDinglay, I've already started upgrading\nmy Lord's Mansion to tier 2. Dinglay is\nawesome. It seems that Dinglay is going\nto become the first player in my newbie\nzone to complete the second level of\nLord's Mansion. Awesome. Many people\nhaven't even upgraded to a higher level\nyet. A genius is a genius. You can't\ncompare. Dinglay he. It's just a tiny\ninsignificant achievement. Nothing to\nbrag about. He say, \"Then why did you\njump out and say you're starting to\nupgrade to a second tier university?\"\nDinglay, I'm just encouraging everyone.\nYou should know that five people have\nalready successfully upgraded to the\nsecond tier. Besides Dugu Xiaolan, who\nranked first, there are four other\nexperts, all of whom are from other\nnewbie zones. Sigh. You know, in the\nlast heroic first recruitment, our 89757\nnewb zone took the first, 9inth, and\n10th spots. Now that Lynn Shiao is\nexhausted from running around, it's our\nduty to carry the banner of the newbie\nzone. Heay was speechless for a moment.\nThe chat channel was filled with eusive\npraise for Dinglay. The pretty girl also\nsent a private message to Heay, advising\nhim to calm down. Dinglay then said,\n\"Perhaps I should have more confidence\nin our newbie zone. Lyn Shia and\nChufinga are both top tier players. They\nshould still be a fighting force. I also\nreally hope that they can complete the\nupgrade before me. Nothing more than\nthis. It's the glory of the entire\nnewbie zone, not just my personal\nglory.\" \"Wow,\" Dinglay is so generous.\nDinglay smiled and quietly enjoyed the\npraise and cheers from the crowd until\nthe main god system notification sound\ncame immediately. Lynn Shiao has\nsuccessfully upgraded to a second tier\nuniversity, becoming the sixth ranked\nnewbie lord in Lan district this year.\nDinglays expression stiffened for a\nmoment and his mood quickly sank. In the\nend, Lynn Sha beat him to it. I failed\nagain. But soon the feedback from the\nLord's talent became strangely more and\nmore numerous and stronger. Dinglay\nrealized. It turns out that the last few\nwords I said just now perfectly saved my\nday. I didn't fail. Dinglay breathed a\nsigh of relief. Lyn Sha. Oh Lyn Sha, you\ntruly are my destined enemy. If you\ndon't die, how can I maximize my\ntalents? How can I become stronger? I\neven need to acknowledge you when I'm\nshowing off just to avoid being proven\nwrong by you. No, I can't let you keep\nrunning ahead of me. Dinglay took out\nhis epic great sword, examined it for a\nmoment, and finally made up his mind.\nChapter 81. The emperor's soul possesses\nhim again. Lyn Sha arrived at the\nterritory gate where the war was already\nraging. But upon closer inspection, Lyn\nSha was greatly surprised because after\ncompleting the second level, there will\nbe a beast tide. But in front of your\nown territory, there is still a demon\ntide. Demonic beasts, bone demons, nest\ndemons, violent demons, demon children,\nlonghorned evil spirits, nightmare\nbeasts, three-headed hell hounds, and\ninfected creatures. A uniform array of\ndemonic soldiers and monsters. Sword\nSaint Pay Min transformed into a beam of\nsword light and charged into the demonic\ntide. Wherever he passed, no one could\nstop him. From their first defense\nagainst the demonic tide, their soldiers\nwere incredibly skilled and orderly on\nthe second occasion. Despite the\nthousands of demons surging forward, not\na single one could reach the gate. Just\nthen, Chin Leong Yu arrived and her\narcher command S rank and all troop\ncommand a rank effects immediately took\neffect. The attributes of both the\ndivine archer and the phantom archer are\nimmediately increased by 50%. The iron\nguard with the Mod Dao Voidal will\nreceive a direct increase of 30%. 20\nWhite Spear spearman formed a line and\ncame behind the Mod Dao iron guards. The\ntwo of them and the Mod Dao iron guards\nformed a group with the Mod Dao iron\nguards in front and the white pole spear\nsoldiers behind. The nearly 4 m long\nwhite handled spear pointed diagonally\nat the sky. When the demon came in front\nof the MO Dao iron guard, the spear was\nquickly lowered and thrust out. The\nwhite spearmen were much faster than the\niron guards with their long swords. They\nwielded their spears quickly and\naccurately. And when two spears were\nthrust out at the same time, both demons\nwere pierced through. On the main\nbattlefield, the Mod Dao soldiers and\nthe Bygon soldiers formed an\nimpenetrable human wall to block all the\nsurging demons. Seeing that all the\ntroops were elite, their positions were\ncunning, their numbers were small, and\nShin Leong Yu had little room to command\nthem for the time being. With a delicate\nshout, she raised her white spear. her\ncloak billowing behind her and charged\ninto the demonic tide, unleashing\npowerful and sweeping attacks to kill\nher enemies. The main force of the\ndemonic tide still consists of five\nlevel 30 epic nest demons. Payman has\nalready killed one nest demon and is now\ndealing with the second one. Chin Leong\nYu fought her way through the enemy\nlines, charging straight towards another\nepic level demon. To catch the thief,\nfirst catch the king, kill the nest\ndemon, and the power of the demon tide\nwill be greatly reduced. Although Chin\nLeong Yu, a master of spear fighting,\ndid not possess the same outstanding\nskills as Pay Min, her marshall prowess\nwas still not to be underestimated. Her\nmarksmanship was characterized by speed,\naccuracy, and ruthlessness. It was\nunassuming yet highly effective and\nlethal demon whose attributes are far\nsuperior to her own. Chin Leong Yu can\nstill subtly gain the upper hand. As the\ndemonic tide was wiped out one by one,\nmy experience points steadily increased\nand the energy of the battlefield of all\nraces gradually rose as well. Knowing\nthat the situation on the battlefield\nhad stabilized, Lyn Sha put his hands\nbehind his back and nodded secretly. At\nthis moment, amidst the demonic tide,\nthe ground suddenly cracked open and a\nstream of magma shot into the sky. A\ngigantic demon, entirely crimson red,\nwielding a broken great sword and\nsporting a severed horn on its head,\nemerged. Abyss demon. Lyn Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s\neyes narrowed slightly. It was actually\nthe same abyss demon from before.\nInsignificant humans. Loly scum. Humble\nants fit only for the ninth heaven. The\nabyss demon roared. This time, I will\ntake your dog's life. Having said that,\nthe abyss demon raised his hand and\nactivated endless hatred. Another\nmassive shower of meteors plummeted from\nthe sky. Damn, shameless. It's that\ntrick again. A wide area, high damage\nAoE skill. Lyn Shiao immediately took\nout the talismans from his spatial\nstorage. Use a purple quality defensive\nrune. The talisman vanished instantly,\nand Lyn Xhao's territory was immediately\nenveloped by a transparent barrier. With\na deafening boom, a shower of meteors\ncrashed down on the territo's barrier,\ncausing the entire territory to tremble\nviolently. Fortunately, with this\nbarrier, the Lord's manor was defended,\nand the phantom archers, whose defenses\nwere weak, were unharmed because they\nwere firing arrows within the territory.\nUpon seeing that it was this abyss demon\nagain, Pay Min felt a chill and prepared\nto attack him. The ground cracked open\nand two more abyssal demons emerged,\nattacking Pay Men from both sides. The\nabyss demon stood calmly in the center\nof the battlefield, raising its hand\nonce more. Endless hatred activated,\nmeteor showers fall once more. The\nground shook violently, and the\nterritory barrier was shaken once again.\nThe entire barrier completely absorbed\nthis large-scale AoE damage. The abyss\ndemon raised its hand again, and endless\nhatred continued to fall. The target\nthis time is the iron guards of the Mod\nDao and the White Spear spearman\nstanding outside the territory gates.\nLyn Sha thought to himself, \"This is\nbad. The Mod Dao iron guards had amazing\ndefenses, but the White Pole Spear\nsoldiers were mountain soldiers from a\nminority ethnic group who were\nexceptionally brave. However, for some\nreason, their armor did not cover their\nentire bodies, and their arms were still\nexposed. Boom! The iron guards with\ntheir long swords stood at the forefront\nto resist the demonic tide, while the\nWhite Pole spearmen wielded their spears\nin a dazzling display to deflect the\nfalling meteorites. However, several\nwhite armored soldiers were still\ninjured by the meteorites that were\nflying everywhere. Their bare arms were\npierced and bleeding. Linhao's eyes\nnarrowed. This is my legendary gold tier\nunit, and it's the first time it's been\ninjured. Who commands the White Spear\narmy is still suppressing the nest\ndemons and has no room to maneuver or\nprovide relief. The wounded White Spear\nsoldier roared, igniting the fighting\nspirit of all the White Spear Soldier\nsoldiers. Blood frenzy triggered. Blood\nlust. When a white spearman bleeds, a\nberserk state is triggered. Strength,\nspirit, and constitution are immediately\nincreased by 30% and last until the end\nof the battle. Moreover, as the injury\nworsens, the berserk state bonus will\ncontinue to increase up to a maximum of\n100% for all three attributes. In\naddition to the wounded white spear\nsoldiers, the uninjured soldiers nearby\nwho also possess blood lust will enjoy a\n30% bonus to all three attributes until\nthe end of the battle. In a berserk\nstate, the White Spear Spearman enters a\nfearless state, becoming unaffected by\nmind magic and unafraid of pain and\nreaching maximum attack speed. The White\nSpear Spearman's bloodlust was\ntriggered, even affecting the Mo Dao\nIron Guard, who also possessed the\nbloodlust skill. The two melee classes\nwere unleashed with ferocity, advancing\ninstead of retreating, pushing back\nagainst the demonic tide. A flicker of\nsurprise crossed the eyes of the abyss\ndemon Brans, who then waved his hand\nagain. The meteor shower fell again. The\nwhite-clad soldiers withstood the attack\nfrom above. Their fighting spirit\nreignited and they charged forward. In\nthat instant, the demonic tide seemed to\nbe tottering as if it were being\ncounterattacked by Lyn Xiao's dozens of\ntroop types. Lyn Xiao's gaze grew colder\nand colder. Although his legendary\ngolden troops were incredibly powerful,\nwhether they were the iron guards with\nlong swords or the white spearmen, each\none could take on 10 excellent demons\nwithout breaking a sweat. The demon tide\nwas endless and he couldn't kill them\nall in a short time. And this abyssal\ndemon came prepared. Does it have an\nendless supply of mana and no cool down\nyet? The other two abyssal demons\nweren't able to fight like that either.\nPayman is now fighting two abyss demons\nalone. This abyss demon who had dealt\nwith Lynn Shiao twice before is hiding\nin the center of the map throwing meteor\nshower which the divine archer can't\nhit. For the time being there is no one\nwho can deal with him. We can't&lt;unk&gt;t\nlet him continue like this, otherwise my\nlord's manner and my troops will suffer\ncasualties sooner or later. Lynn Shiao\ngritted his teeth and decided to go\nhimself. Because of the large number of\nmonsters killed, the battlefield energy\nhas now reached 1,000 points. I don't\nhave enough energy to use the limited\nsummoning ability of the Hasha token. We\ncan only try our luck. Let's summon the\nsoul of the Chinese emperor directly.\nHopefully, he's not a weak emperor.\nexchange for 1,000 points of battlefield\nenergy and use the Hashia token,\nEmperor&lt;unk&gt;'s soul, to summon. A golden\nlight shone down from the sky, piercing\nthrough the endless fog on the\noverlooking all living beings. In an\ninstant, countless imperial souls surged\ntowards Lyn Sha. Chapter 82. A great\nsuccess. It was actually this emperor.\nLynn Sha once again saw hundreds of the\nheroic spirits of Chinese emperors\nfloating before him. This time, he did\nnot take it upon himself to choose the\nemperor he desired. Instead, he stood\nstill, his expression calm, waiting for\nthe emperor&lt;unk&gt;'s soul to come to him\non its own. The eerie laughter of the\nsecond shadowy figure as he imparted his\nsecrets echoed again. This\nemperor&lt;unk&gt;'s soul knows how to choose\npeople. The first person you recruited\nwas Xiang Ji because you are from\nJangdong and Xiang Ji was also from\nJangdong. He had a good impression of\npeople from Jangdong. You want to be\nchosen as the first emperor and the\ngeneral of heavenly strategy. That\ndepends on whether others even think\nyou're worthy. Otherwise, you can use\nbattlefield energy to bombard them. As\nlong as you have enough energy and you\nimpose strict conditions on them, it's\nnot impossible for Wuatin to come at\nyou. Cough, cough. Stop fighting. The\nsecond shadowy figure dodged the first\nshadowy figure's hand and add it. If you\ntruly lack the power, then project an\nimage of strength and profoundity. There\nwill always be blind emperors who come\nlooking for you. He the recollection\nends. This is just showing off to\nintimidate the emperor's soul. Lyn Sha\nsteadied himself and responded calmly. 1\nsecond, 2 seconds. Lynn Sha remained\nunmoved, exuding composure and grandeur,\nas if he himself were one of the\nemperors, majestic and profound. A man\nof medium build with narrow eyes, a long\nbeard, and a broad face, exuding an aura\nof shrewdness and doineering presence,\nwalked straight towards them. \"I sense\nsomething about you that attracts me.\nYou need my abilities. Go forth and\nconquer. Conquer everyone.\" The\nemperor's spirit actually spoke. Then it\ninstantly merged into Lin Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s\nconsciousness. Lynho&lt;unk&gt;s eyes closed\nand opened. The spirit of the emperor\nhas possessed me. All is complete. Good.\nLyn Shia was in a great mood. Although\nthis heroic spirit was not good-looking,\nits abilities were undeniable. Emperor\nWu of Wei Chow Chow. Ability borrowing\nlevel one. Degree of integration\nextremely low. Duration 24 hours.\nAbilities: Click to view doineering.\nSrank ruthless hero in chaotic times\nslashcapable minister in peaceful times.\nPoetry composed while holding a spear.\nAll troop types command a rank. Wayi Wu\nLegacy note. Due to the low integration\nlevel of Chow Chow, some abilities are\nstill hidden and cannot be possessed.\nWith time running out, Lyn Sha quickly\nchecked Chow Chows first few skills.\nOverbearing Chow Chow aderes to a\nhegemonic approach granting him a 50%\nincrease in personal marshall prowess.\nChow Chow's strength, spirit, physique,\nand soul all attributes are increased by\n50%. Intelligence, political ability,\nand command ability. The latter three\ntranslate to increased mental agility,\nfarming efficiency, and battlefield\ntroop leadership for the user. A\ntreacherous hero in times of chaos slash\na capable minister in times of peace.\nChow Chow never escaped this label\nthroughout his life, but he was quite\nsatisfied with it. When Chow Chow\npossesses the host, the host's wealth,\nexperience, and energy gained in war are\nincreased by 100%. When constructing in\na territory, the output of all mineral\nveins, spirit fields, and troops is\nincreased by 50%. holding a spear and\ncomposing a poem. Also known as a hero\nof his time, Chow Chow possessed a\nunique charisma that commanded respect,\nhe could fight on horseback, govern the\ncountry on foot, pour wine by the river,\nand compose poetry with his spear across\nhis hand. Chow Chow and his spirits\ngrant a 100% increase to the host's\ncharm, creating a strong attraction that\ndraws people in, inspiring emotions such\nas allegiance, loyalty, respect, and\nadmiration. Target audience: both men\nand women. All troop types command level\nA increases all troop types four main\nattributes by 30%. Lyn Sha glanced at it\nquickly and made a judgment in his mind.\nUnfortunately, Shin Leong Yu already has\na level command of all troop types, so\nChow Chows skill overlaps with hers and\nhas no effect, which is a waste. Chow\nChows skills are very comprehensive, Lin\nSha thought to himself. Not only is he\nintellectually gifted and politically\nastute, but he also possesses\nconsiderable personal combat skills.\nWith the spirit of Emperor Wu of Wei\npossessing him, Lyn Sha wearing the\nfour-piece scale rock set and wielding\nthe holy sword Falion has the following\nattributes. Lyn Sha level 10.\nAttributes: Strength 69 + 150 + 95.\nSpirit 70 + 150 + 95. Constitution 45 +\n150 + 100.

Chow Chow's spirit is not\nlike Xiang Yu's which directly adds 200\nto 300 to strength and constitution, but\nit is more comprehensive with all four\nattributes added by 150. Lyn Sha scale\nrock set added 70 points to all\nattributes. The life amulet adds 30\npoints to constitution. At this moment,\nLyn Sha took out the holy sword falion\nagain, and his strength and spirit\nattributes increased by 25 each. Lyn Sha\ncouldn't help but sigh. Spending money\non in-game purchases is so satisfying.\nBeing lucky is so satisfying. The\nexcellent armor set and epic weapon that\nare almost complete are something that\nwould take an ordinary lord decades or\neven centuries to acquire in the\nofficial server. Even powerful families\nand top ranking lords don't necessarily\nown a set. He had only been in the\nbattlefield of 10,000 races for a few\ndays, and he had already almost achieved\nit. Lyn Xiao's attributes now far\nsurpass those of anyone under his\ncommand. It is also far superior to the\nabyssal demons in the demonic tide. With\nthe spirit of the Chinese emperor fully\npossessed, Lynn Sha laughed heartily.\nBrance, come out and face your death.\nAfter saying that, Lyn Shao stepped out\nof the territory barrier and charged\ndirectly at Brans, who was constantly\nreleasing meteor fire ring. When the\nabyss demon saw Lin Sha personally go to\nthe battlefield, he was first delighted,\nthen suddenly shocked. Ishi was happy\nbecause last time Lyn Sha had to rely on\nsword saint paymin to severely injure\nhim before he could defeat him, and his\nstrength was not as good as his. This\ntime he actually dared to break into the\ndemonic tide on his own. Wasn't this\njust courting death? The shock came from\nthe fact that Lyn Sha was radiating\nmurderous intent, constantly releasing\nhis aura of malevolence, and his entire\nbody was overflowing with energy. He was\nclearly very powerful and difficult to\ndeal with. Lynsha stepped into the\ndemonic tide, wielding a holy sword in\nhis left hand and a demonic spear in his\nright, charging left and right.\nUnstoppable, it charged straight at the\nabyssal demon Brand. Seeing Lyn Xiao's\nfree and doineering attack posture on\nthe battlefield, the abyss demon\nswallowed hard, inexplicably feeling.\nEven from a demon's perspective, this\nenemy is somewhat handsome. Bran\nsuddenly realized what he was thinking.\nA human who dares to defile the demon\nprincess. You must die. The abyss demon\nraised its massive broken greats sword.\nRevenge counterattack activated. Damage\nis increased by 50% against enemies who\nhave severely attacked you. Are you ever\ngoing to stop? I've already told you I\ndon't know your princess. Lyn Xiao's\nlong sword and spear clashed, easily\nblocking the abyss demons attacks. Was\nthis demonic tide you're doing? Were you\nbehind the four rare mineral veins? You\ndemon, you actually resort to ambush\ntactics? Lyn Shia was a martial arts\nchampion in school. Although his skills\nwere not as good as those of a top\ngeneral like Xiang Yu, he was definitely\na master. Now, with Xiao Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s\nspirit possessing him, his combat\nabilities have reached a new level. Lyn\nShiao s relentless pressure with his\ndual weapons, Brans had no choice but to\nretreat repeatedly. Shut up. I am a\nnoble, high-ranking demon, just like the\nnoble succubus princess. The demon\nroared, but Lynn Shiao gradually\noverwhelmed it, leaving it powerless to\nfight back. Ba, what superior demon\nrace? You're always slandering my\ninnocence out of thin air. When did I\never have anything to do with your\nprincess? I, Chow Chow, only like to say\npa. No, that's not right. Today, I'll\nshow you just how many bowls of noodles\nI, Lyn Sha, have eaten. Chapter 83. Why\nis the Succubus Princess angry? Lyn Shia\nlaunched a series of powerful attacks,\nputting the abyss demon in grave danger.\nDie. Finally, the demonic spear in\nLiao&lt;unk&gt;s hand suddenly burst into\nlight, drawing the demon's attention.\nLyn Shao then threw it with all his\nmight. Demonic lance named Knight's\nlance Brianac flew out as a streak of\nlight, piercing straight through the\nhead of the abyss demon. The tenacious\nabyssal demon coughed up blood and\ncollapsed with a mournful howl. I will\ncome back. Lyn Sha swung his long sword\nand the abyss demon's head fell off.\nThen its entire body turned to ashes.\nThe villain really talks too much. Lyn\nSha muttered to himself. After killing\nthe actual leader of this demonic tide,\nthe high-ranking demonic abyss demon\nbrands. The pressure from the demonic\ntide instantly decreased. The MO Dao\niron guards in their berserk state\nalmost completely destroyed the demonic\ntide. Your lordship is mighty. When the\nsoldiers saw their lord personally take\nto the battlefield and kill the local\nleader, they shouted in unison, their\nmorale soaring. The two heroes on the\nbattlefield had also killed their\nrespective enemies. And upon seeing\nthis, they immediately rushed to their\nlord's place. Soon, this wave of second\ntier university students will come to an\nend. Lynn Shiao sheathed his demonic\nspear, carrying only the uniquely shaped\ndragon bone, holy sword fal at his\nwaist. With his hands behind his back,\nhe stood calmly amidst the demonic tide,\nwatching his soldiers fight valiantly.\nHis aura was so strong that none of the\nremaining demons dared to attack him.\nHis mission was accomplished. King\nagainst king, he had killed Brance. The\nremaining killings were the business of\nhis men. Pay Min and Chin Leong Yu\napproached Lin Sha and knelt on one\nknee. Lord, your divine might is\nunparalleled. We failed to arrive in\ntime to rescue you. Please punish us,\nLord. The two heroes were caught off\nguard, and the Lord went and killed the\nstrongest demon tide boss by himself.\nLynn Shia nodded calmly. It's all right.\nI came here on my own. The abyss demon\nbranch has been killed. You all should\nhurry and wipe out the remaining ones.\nYes, sir. Pay Min and Chin Leong Yu then\ngot up. Lin Shia intended to return\ndirectly to his territory, but\nunexpectedly, he spotted Chinang Yu\nwearing scale armor, a scarlet cloak,\nher long hair tied in a high ponytail\nreaching her waist, covered in blood,\nexuding a heroic and incomparably\nbeautiful aura. At that glance, Lyn\nXiao&lt;unk&gt;s heart pounded wildly. Married\nwomen are great. an endless sea of lava.\nThe pitch black lava path leads directly\nto the island. Inside the palace, a\nstunningly beautiful succubus listened\nto the report from her succubus maid,\nher expression gradually turning\nstrange. That idiot brands. Call him\nover here. Before the palace, the\npermanent teleportation array shone\nbrightly. And from within the flames, a\ngigantic one-horned demon stepped out.\nThe stunningly beautiful succubus stood\nbefore the teleportation array, her\npretty face slightly frosty, holding a\nlong thorny whip in her hand. Master.\nThe onehorned demon knelt on one knee,\nburying its head deep into the rubble\nstrewn ground. Brans, look what you've\ndone. A melodious yet murderous voice\nrang out, and the abyss demon dared not\nmove, saying, Brans has been defeated.\nHe failed to kill the human brat and\navenge her highness the princess asel.\nThe long whip fell, lashing the abyss\ndemon and sending up a spray of lava and\nblood. The demon could not withstand the\nblow and collapsed rolling on the\nground. Master Bran's strength is\nsuppressed to level 30 upon entering the\nbeginner area. There's no way to Is this\nwhat I meant? The succubus lashed out\nwith her whip again, and the abyss demon\nhowled in agony. Brans doesn't\nunderstand your highness. Your dog nose\nis really sharp. You even dare to sniff\nmy scent. But when are you going to\ncontrol your dog mouth? The succubus\nlashed out at the abyssal demons on the\nground, muttering hatefully. Your\nnonsense has spread throughout the\nentire newbie zone. What? I merely used\na secret demonic technique to remotely\nimplant a mark into that human boy's\nbody, so of course he will bear my aura.\nThe succubus said coldly. What are you\nyelling about outside? Your highness, I\nam terrified. I was wrong. What's wrong\nwith it? The succubus lashed out with\nher whip again. The abyss demon brand\nstammered. I I shouldn't have ruined her\nhighness's reputation. Madness. The\nsuccubus lashed out again and again,\ncausing the abyss demon to scream in\nagony. When the succubus s hand was\ntired, she stopped angrily and handed\nthe whip to the maid beside her. What's\nwrong with it? the succubus asked again.\nBrans buried her head deep in the\nsuccubus s high heels, trembling as she\nsaid. I am unaware. The succubus said\ncoldly. Your mistake lies in this. It's\nalways been me, the princess, who has\nalways taken advantage of respectable\nmen. How could it be that I, the\nprincess, have been slept with by a man?\nCan't you speak properly? Abyss demon,\nhuh? The succubus was instantly enraged\nand kicked the massive abyssal demon\nseveral times over. This is a disgrace\nto our highranking demon race. Has that\nweapon been delivered? Brans mumbled.\nIt's been delivered. He killed me in a\nsolo kill, so I guess I gave him the\nkill. Oh, he's now capable of solo\nkilling you. That's because my level is\nsuppressed. Shut up. The succubus\nsnapped. Even a random sycophant I could\npick from the ninth heaven is better\nthan you. Now go back to your lair. A\nsimp?\" The abyss demon asked, puzzled.\n\"What kind of unit is that?\" Roll. The\nabyss demon dared not ask any more\nquestions, hastily, entered the\nteleportation array, and disappeared.\nThe stunningly beautiful succubus\nprincess stood silently, lost in\nthought. \"The term simp is really\ninteresting, human kid. How many more\nsurprising things can you tell us?\nYou've grown up so fast. It wasn't a\nwaste of my investment in you in\nadvance. The succubus licked her bright\nred lips. I'm really looking forward to\nyou entering the official zone soon so\nyou can teach those hypocritical\nwhite-winged a lesson. Only then\nwill the magical mark I cast with my\nlifeblood truly explode. He was quickly\nand completely eradicated under the\ncommand of pay Min and Chin Leonu. Upon\nreturning to his territory, Lin Sha\nheard the notification from the main god\nsystem. You have successfully resisted\nthe S-class demonic tide. Rewards are\nbeing calculated. It's still an S rank\ndemonic tide. Lyn Sha curled his lips.\nNo wonder his White Spear soldiers were\ninjured and their blood lust was\ntriggered, forcing him to personally\ntake to the battlefield. Battle results.\nAnnihilate the following enemies. One\nabyss demon special. Epic. Two abyss\ndemons. Epic. Five nest demons. Epic.\n115 violent demons, excellent. 655\nfierce demons, rare. 1,00 bone demons,\nrare. And 1,000 horn demons, fine.\nBattle duration, 2 hours for minutes and\n35 seconds. Our casualties, zero.\nSpecial stacking, s level, demonic tide,\nlord personally participating in the\nbattle, and the difference between the\nlords and troops levels exceeding 10\nlevels. and special epic level boss in\nthe beginner area.

Excellent. Emperor Wu of Wei\nis truly formidable. Once the ruthless\nhero of chaos is activated, experience\nand energy on the battlefield increase\nby 100%. It's perfect for me right now.\nLyn Sha couldn't contain his joy. Thanks\nto ancient demon number two, his\nsuggestion allowed me to get Chow Chow\nfor free for 24 hours. What good luck! I\nreally don't know why Emperor Wu of Wei\nwould willingly possess me. Chapter 84.\nThe Legacy of Wei Woo. Exploding Arrow\nTowers. This demonic tide was like\nsending charcoal and snowy weather to\nLyn Shao because Lynsha desperately\nneeded experience to upgrade the troops\nhe would summon next. The demonic tide\njust happened to relieve Lin Xiao's\nimmediate crisis and even replenished a\nlot of battlefield energy. An epic item\nwas also revealed and Lin Shia clicked\nto view it first. Ashbrer epic weapon\nquality orange epic attributes base\nattack power 580 strength plus 30\nconstitution plus 20 special attribute\nfire attribute attack critical hit rate\nincreased by 20% accuracy increased by\n20%. When attacking an enemy there is a\ncertain chance to absorb the enemy's\nlife force. When attacking an enemy\nthere is a certain chance to trigger a\nfire explosion. Introduction. The\ndwarven king forged Ashbringer from a\ncrystal purified by the followers of the\nholy light, thus giving the sword the\nextraordinary quality of carrying the\nholy light. Because this sword can turn\nthe undead to ashes, it is named\nAshbringer. This weapon looks familiar.\nLyn Sha nodded and then examined another\nweapon, a bright silver spear. Bright\nsilver spear. Excellent weapon. Quality\npurple. Excellent. Attributes. Base\nattack power 315, constitution plus 10.\nSpecial attribute increases critical hit\nrate by 20% when attacking. Just an\nordinary outstanding weapon. Having seen\ncountless epic weapons, Lyn Sha was\nsomewhat dismissive of this exceptional\nweapon. Give it to Chin Leong Yu. Lyn\nSha had arranged a place for the weapons\nand planned to call Chin Leongyu back.\nLooking up, I saw Baoi, draped in a\nbright red cloak, sitting in the square,\nwhispering with a group of flower\nfairies. Ba seemed to sense something\nand noticed Lynsha looking at her. So,\nshe got up and walked towards Lynsha. My\nlord, Baoi bowed gracefully. Baoi, where\nwere you when the demonic tide attacked?\nBa's expression turned somewhat somber,\nbut she quickly regained her composure.\nMy lord, I activated my cloak to become\ninvisible as soon as I saw General Chin\nappear. Why? Lynsha asked, puzzled.\nGeneral Chin is dashing and handsome\nwith unparalleled charm. I saw that\nGeneral Chen's eyes were full of\nadmiration for the Lord, and I did not\nwant to spoil the Lord&lt;unk&gt;'s good time,\nso I hid away. What is this? Lyn Sha was\nboth amused and exasperated. Lean Yu is\nstraightforward and her womanly heroine\nskills make her naturally loyal to the\nLord. It's not what you think. My lord,\nplease do not underestimate my\nintuition. Furthermore, I have been\nunable to serve the Lord in bed these\npast few days. General Chen. Haha. Ba,\nyou're overthinking it. Look, I'll call\nher over. Lynn Sha directly summoned\nChin Leong Yu to the square through the\nsystem. Leang Yu, this is your bright\nsilver spear. Lyn Shao handed the weapon\ndirectly to the valiant female general.\nThank you, my lord. Overjoyed, Chin\nLeong Yu solemnly accepted the gleaming\nsilver spear, her delight evident in her\nexpression. Her eyebrows and eyes were\nexquisite, and her features were\nbeautiful. Her smile was even more\ncaptivating. Lyn Sha felt his heart\nstirring uncontrollably. With a cheerful\nsmile, he blurted out, \"Liong Yu, I\nheard the White Spear soldiers call you\nmadam. Are you married?\" As soon as he\nsaid those words, Lyn Sha realized what\nhe meant. \"What's wrong with me? How can\nI even ask such a question? It's&lt;unk&gt;\nover.\" So that's why Chow Chow actively\nsought to possess me. My lord, Lyang Yu\nis already married. Chin Leong Yu didn't\nmince words and answered directly. Lyang\nYu doesn't remember who she married. She\nonly remembers that she was married, but\nunfortunately her husband died young\nmany years ago. I don't remember who I\nmarried. Could it be that the god system\nchanged it? Or is it the work of an\nancient demon? Lyn Sha tends to believe\nthat this is the system character\nsetting for Chin Leang Yu in the main\ngod system. When deploying heroes, the\ngod system selects heroes based on their\noptimal age and memories to maximize\ntheir strength and ensure their loyalty\nto their lord. There are some well-known\ncases in a formal district. A certain\nchief lord whose strongest hero was\nLancelot, one of the knights of the\nround table. According to western\nhistory, Lancelot was loyal only to King\nArthur. However, if the heroes summoned\nin this way are not loyal to the lord,\nthe game of the battlefield of all races\ncannot proceed. Therefore, Lancelot, the\nknight of the round table, directly\ntransferred his loyalty to Arthur to his\nlord, giving that lucky lord a powerful\nhero with high loyalty. It seems that\nChin Leang Yu is portrayed as a female\ngeneral who leads an army alone after\nher husband's death. Sigh, he's a man\nwith a tragic fate. Lyn Sha thought to\nhimself. Oh, she's a widow. Another\nvoice in my head thought. Lyn Sha was\nonce again reminded that this was not\nhis true thought. Chowo Chow.\nAbsolutely. Chowo Chow. Please accept my\ncondolences, Leon Yu. From now on, treat\nthis place as your own home. Lyn Sha was\ngentle and kind. We'll take care of your\nwife myself, so don't worry. Another\nvoice in his heart said. Lyn Shao\nsuddenly shook his head. This is\ndefinitely not my own idea. Impossible.\nAbsolutely impossible. Turning his head,\nhe saw Ba with a faint smile, as if to\nsay, \"See, I told you so.\" The\nlord&lt;unk&gt;'s eyes are practically glowing\nwith greed when he looks at General\nChin. \"Damn it! Even Baoi seems less\ncharming than Chin Leongyu now.\"\nXiaoming, you've really come at the\nperfect time. Lyn Shao dared not look at\nChin Leang Yu any longer and waved his\nhand, ordering her to lead her troops to\nclean up the battlefield. Before Chin\nLeong Yu left, Lin Shiao arranged for\nseveral farmers to build her exclusive\nresidence, the Tusci village. It also\ntakes 2 days to build and will be\ncompleted in 2 days. You can produce\nwhite spearman a hem. Ba, it's getting\nlate. The battlefield has been quite\nfruitful this time. Lynn Shiao changed\nthe subject. Could you open a treasure\nchest for me and see if you can? Ba's\neyes crinkled into crescent moons as she\nsmiled. Very well. I am willing to serve\nmy lord. Ding. Your hero has opened an\nexcellent treasure chest and obtained an\nexcellent spirit field. Lyn Sha forgot\nthat Bao's luck value is still negative.\nBa, my lord, have I messed up? Lyn Sha?\nNot really. I have lots of treasure\nchests. Seeing Bao's dejected look, Lyn\nSha couldn't help but say, Ba, let me\ntell you a joke. A minute later, Ba's\ngiggles like silver bells rang out. A\nmaster of both advancement and retreat.\nA soft rice eater who stubbornly lives\noff his wife. Haha. The tiger of the\nmajor crimes unit. Lyn Sha breathed a\nsigh of relief when he heard Ba's luck\nvalue rise to minus78 again. He secretly\nthought to himself that he must tell\nBaoi more jokes so that he could reach\n100 loyalty points as soon as possible\nand also increase his luck value. If\nBa's luck value is positive and combined\nwith her own luck, wouldn't she be the\nreincarnation of a lucky person? Now,\nyou should open the treasure chest\nyourself. Lynn Sha opened the treasure\nchests one by one. Let's start with the\nhighquality treasure chests. All of them\nconsist of ordinary resources and\nexcellent equipment. Then from the rare\ntreasure chest, I got a teleportation\nscroll and a quest scroll. The rest are\nspirit fields and resources. Two more\nexcellent farmer talismans were obtained\nfrom the excellent treasure chest. Well,\nLyn Shia could just recruit them\ndirectly to save trouble as he was\nalways short of farmers. The remaining\nexcellent chests yielded some resources,\nbringing me one step closer to upgrading\nto level three. Now it's finally time\nfor the epic chests. Lyn Sha calmly\nopened the epic treasure chest. Obtained\none blueprint for the explosive arrow\ntower. Nice one. Build arrow towers\nwithin your territory. Finally, I don't\nhave to leave any troops at home to\nguard the base. Lyn Sha thought to\nhimself. Place a few explosive arrow\ntowers in your home. They're epic level\ndefensive structures that most enemies\nwon't be able to withstand. If any arrow\ntowers can't hold out, immediately use a\nteleportation scroll to return home and\nface them head-on. Check the explosive\narrow towers attributes. Chapter 85.\nLynho's plan. Dinglays actions. By\nlearning the blueprints for the string\narrow tower and acquiring the necessary\nmaterials, you can construct the\nexplosive arrow tower. Explosive arrow\ntower. Quality epic. Level one. Defense\n15,000. Damage value 500 1 0 0 per shot.\nSpecial skill can fire multiple\nexplosive arrows at once, causing fatal\ndamage to enemies. Building materials\nrequired 1,500 fine wood, 1,500 fine\nstone, 1,500 fine iron, 1,500 fine\ncopper, five aggwood trunks.\nConstruction time 48 24 hours.\nConstruction requirements: epic level or\nhigher peasants. Lynn Sha understood the\narrow tower was indeed a good one, but\nit required far too many materials. As\nexpected of an epic building, even just\nthese four ordinary upgrade materials\nwould take an average lord 10 to 15 days\nto gather. Then they missed the\nopportunity to upgrade their manner and\nfell far behind others. Lyn Xiao's\nsecond level is complete with a 48-hour\ncool down period. Before that, he has\nalready captured several highlevel\nmaterial mines such as refined iron.\nNow, after some calculations, even if I\nstop mining with the mineral resources I\ncurrently control, I will have enough\nresources to upgrade to level three in\n48 hours. A level three lord's manor are\nfar more than 10 times that of a level\ntwo manor, and they are all highle\nmaterials. The monsters guarding the\nmanor are powerful and tyrannical, and\nmost lords cannot afford to provoke\nthem. This is also the source of Lin\nXiao's confidence to only get sixth\nplace in the second tier universities\nand then directly snatch first place in\nthe third tier universities. It's thanks\nto the eternal peace mineral vein that\nits resource production speed is five\ntimes faster than others, while its\nupgrade speed is increased by 100%. He\ncan upgrade to level three as soon as\nthe cool down is over and no one else\nhas been able to do it in previous\nyears. Now that we have the explosive\narrow tower, we need even more\nresources. We also need to prepare\nresources for the three buildings,\nincluding the stables, in advance. As\nfor what kind of resources are needed\nand how much, top student Lin Sha\nalready had it all memorized. The main\nmaterial for the explosive arrow tower\nis aggerwood trunk, which is usually\nfound in only a few groves in the\nbeginner area. It seems there's a small\ngrove of trees inside my calabash\nmountain range. However, it's quite\nin-depth and it conflicts somewhat with\nmy planned route. Lyn Sha closed his\neyes and recalled the map. Suddenly, a\nbrilliant idea came to mind. It was\ngetting late and Lyn Sha, who had made\nhis plans, was also tired. He sold all\nthe junk equipment he got from the\ntreasure chest to the auction house.\nThen put his hand on Bao's shoulder and\nwent back to his room to rest. Faintly,\nLyn Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s voice could be heard\ncoming from inside the room. He Ba. The\nsound of rubbing hands together. Are you\neligible for marriage? My lord, I have\nalready told you that I was once the\nconsort of the Zhao Emperor. Although we\ndid not consummate our marriage, does my\nlord find me lacking? Hm. Does that\ncount as being a wife? No, I don't mind.\nBeing married is a plus. No. I like you\nwhether you've been married before or\nnot. The sound of freezing hands and\nfeet came from the room, followed by Lyn\nXiao's impotent rage. Those ancient\ndemons deserve to die. Early the next\nmorning, Lyn Shao immediately led all\nthe troops out of the territory to\nattack the wild monsters. This time, the\nobjective has changed. It's no longer\nabout selecting and upgrading mines. Nor\nis it about specifically hunting for the\nfour rare resources. Rather, it's based\non Linhao's memory to occupy all the\nmountain ridges surrounding the entire\nHolian Mountains. Since Lin Shiao\narrived at the battlefield of 10,000\nraces, he has been expanding outwards,\nbut he has only explored and occupied a\nsmall part of the vast Calabash Mountain\nbehind his territory and monster layers\nhere. There is also a grassland of\nmoderate size and a sandalwood forest.\nThere are still many places worth\noccupying. Lynn Shia had calculated that\neven if he split his forces into three\ngroups, he wouldn't be able to clear out\nall the monsters in the entire valley\nbefore the black flame lord arrived.\nTherefore, what Lynn Shia needs to do is\nto occupy all the ridges of his own Hulu\nmountain range. Then we'll proceed\nslowly and methodically to deal with the\nlittle Kurami inside. Without further\nado, taking advantage of the fact that\nLin Shao, possessed by Emperor Wei Wu,\nwas equipped with magic spears and led\nPay Min Shin Leang Yu and a group of\npowerful soldiers. They immediately\nbegan their clearing campaign. Ding.\nDingle, a player from the Lan region of\nBlue Star Realm, has successfully\nupgraded to tier 2 and become the ninth\nranked rookie lord in Lan region this\nyear. System reward, one excellent\ntreasure chest. Shortly after the\nsounded, Ding Lay, who had defeated the\nbeast tide, appeared in the chat\nchannel. \"Gentlemen, I have successfully\ncompleted my studies and passed the\nsecond tier university entrance exam.\"\nThen, without waiting for others to\npraise him, Ding Lay said directly. \"A\nlot has happened here since I entered\nthe game world. Although I, Ding Lay, am\ncapable, I have always given everyone a\nchance. Evil people like Ziao Daong and\nGene Dang took advantage of the demonic\ntide to launch surprise attacks and kill\ntheir own kind, committing murder and\narson. This is not only intolerable to\nour conscience, nor to the laws of Lang\nShia, but even to the gods system. I,\nDing Lelay, have been trying to give\neveryone a chance to reform, and I've\nbeen secretly advising them, but some\npeople just don't understand. Now, I've\nalready graduated from a second tier\nuniversity, so I'm free to do more.\nAlthough Xiao Daong and Gene Dang have\nbeen killed by my respectable opponent,\nLin Shiao, there are still some ignorant\nfools around. Dingho Zhu Guang Pangia,\ndo you think no one knows what you've\ndone? I, Ding Lelay, am here today with\nmy own talisman to rid the people of\nthis scourge. One hour later, newbie\nzone number 89757.\nPlayer Pangia has been eliminated. A few\nhours later, newbie zone number 89757.\nPlayer Deng who has been eliminated. The\nchat channel immediately erupted into a\nheated discussion. What is Dinglay\ntrying to do? I don't understand. Ding\nLay, the big boss, has started to act on\nbehalf of heaven and eliminate evil.\nIt's true. It's true. One of my\nclassmates was killed by Dangho. He had\na B-level talent and I didn't dare to\nseek revenge. Wow. It turns out I've\nbeen wrong about Ding Lay all along.\nDing Lay isn't a showoff. Just as Ding\nLay was listing the lords and hunting\nthem down one by one, countless people\nin the chat channel were cheering him on\nand showering him with compliments.\nWhile Chufinga was fiercely hacking and\nslashing, he received a message from his\nfather. Has phone good been in contact\nwith Lin Sha recently? Chufunga, now\nwith his red hair restored, chopped down\nan attacking wild beast with a single\nstroke, replying as he did so, \"Dad, do\nyou think I have time to contact Lyn\nShao?\" Shu Yusi nodded. This is a beast\ntied from a second tier university. This\nunfil still has some ambition. But I\nheard that Lin Shia and Ding Lay have\nalready entered second tier universities\nbefore you. Chufinga. Ah, right, right,\nright. I'll kill you. Oh, I didn't mean\nto chop up your father. I meant to chop\nup this venomous scorpion lion. Chu Yusi\nacted as if nothing had happened. Well,\nI was actually thinking of sending you a\nfew recruitment tokens. I love you, old\nman. Chu Yusi remained expressionless.\nThe recruitment warrant has been sent.\nKeep an eye on Lin Shia and protect him\nwell. I heard that his Dao heart was\ndamaged this time and he only got sixth\nplace. Sigh. Young people need more\nexperience. Look at me. You can skull me\nto my face, and I won't even flinch.\nDie, goblin. Chufunga abruptly shut down\nthe communication. Chu Yusi remained\nsilent for a few seconds like a statue.\nThen slowly shook his head and sighed.\nUnfilial descendants. I've heard Ding\nLelay is a famously filial son. If only\nyou were half as well- behaved as him.\nChapter 86. Three great masters suddenly\nappear. Several major events occurred\nthat day. Following Ding Lay, Shufunga\nachieved a second class ranking,\nbecoming the 10th ranked student in the\nLone Non-Bginner Zone. Ding Lay suddenly\nand ostentatiously announced his\nintention to eliminate evil and\nwickedness. He then executed six\nnotorious lords within a single day,\ndrawing applause from countless people\nand greatly increasing their goodwill\ntowards Dinglay. Even the previously\nlukewarm holy alliance founded by Ding\nLelay has become incredibly popular with\na surge in applications to join. The\nthird thing was the sudden announcement\nfrom the newbie zone. Ding. Player Julie\nfrom beginner zone 100086\nhas used a cross zone transfer token to\nbeginner zone 89757.\nDing. Player Wong B from the 100010\nnewbie zone has used a cross zone\ntransfer token to move to the 89757\nnewbie zone. Ding. Player Pan Shanu from\nthe 10,000th newbie zone has used a\ncross zone transfer token to move to the\n89,757th\nnewbie zone. Cross region transfers are\nrare because they are not much easier\nthan crossing into another region. The\nsudden announcement left everyone\nstunned. After a moment, someone\ntentatively asked, \"These names look so\nfamiliar.\" Eay, I also feel a sense of\nfamiliarity as if I've seen it somewhere\nbefore Shan by Chiian. It must have been\nthe system announcement. I remember now.\nJill is the third ranked hero recruit in\nthe newbie zone this year and also the\nsecond ranked hero to upgrade to tier 2.\nEveryone finally remembered. Wongbo is\nthe fourth person in the newbie zone to\nupgrade to a second tier university. Pan\nShan Yu is the fifth person in the\nnewbie zone to upgrade to a second tier\nuniversity. Their names were mentioned\nin the announcement yesterday. A moment\nof silence. My god, these are three big\nshots. What's going on? Why did these\nthree go through all that trouble to\ncome to our 89,757\nnewbie zone from another region? at\nJulie at Wongbo at Pan Shan Yu. Hello\neveryone. No reply. The group tagged\nthese three people multiple times, but\nno one responded. Eay, this is\ninteresting. Our 89757 newbie zone now\nhas six players ranked in the top 10 of\nthe entire Lon regions newbie rankings.\nSecond, fourth, fifth, 6th, 9inth, and\n10th. He's a I need to ask my boss Lyn\nShao if he knows about this. asked Lyn\nShao. That coward Lin Sha hasn't shown\nhis face in ages. Let's ask boss Dingle.\nHeay contacted Lin Sha but received no\nresponse. Having learned his lesson from\nlast time, he dared not call again and\ncould only wait patiently. Boss Lyn\nShao, you've been keeping a low profile\nlately. A few minutes later, Dinglay\nappeared. I was unaware of this matter.\nDinglay analyzed. Such experts would\nhave been ranked number one in their\noriginal newbie zone. Their resources,\nstatus, and influence should all be top\ntier. They crossed districts to come\nhere, bringing with them the mines\nthey'd captured, their troops, heroes,\nand lords mansions, but they lost their\noriginal district's status and power.\nLosing status and power, and rebuilding\nit is very troublesome. Dinglay paused,\ngiving everyone ample time to think\nbefore slowly saying, \"We brought all\nour military force, but abandoned all\nour original forces. Unless Unless\nthey've already basically monopolized\nall the resources in their original\nnewbie zone, and then they come here to\nplunder new resources, establish a new\npower.\" Oh. A chill ran through the chat\nchannel as panic gradually spread.\n\"Really? What?\" Dinglay shook his head\nand said, \"This is just my guess. Take\nit with a grain of salt. Perhaps these\nthree big shots only came here because\nthey had no other choice. In short,\neveryone should be careful. You should\nknow that if any one of them were to be\nchosen apart from me, probably no one\nhere could beat them.\" He's a TCH\nDingle. I can barely believe you, a\nninth ranked player, saying you can beat\na fifth ranked Big Shot. You can win\neven if you come in second place.\nDinglay. The speed of fighting and the\nspeed of construction are different and\nI am full of confidence in myself. He's\na Then Lin Shia can win too. He's the\nnumber one hero in the first move.\nBefore Ding Lay could speak, someone\nelse jumped into the chat channel. Huh?\nIt's Lin Sha again. Lyn Sha is still in\nsixth place. How can he compete with the\nsecond place? I admit Lyn Shia was once\nvery strong, but times have changed,\nsir. I don't really believe Lynn Sha\nwill win either. He's terrified of the\napproaching black flame lord and hasn't\neven managed to maintain his starting\nadvantage. Yes, Lynn Sha hasn't said a\nsingle word in the chat channel for\nseveral days. Didn't we see him fighting\nthe demon yesterday? That demon actually\nsaid he was having an affair with the\ndemon princess. Do you guys remember the\nchaotic monsters from before? They seem\nto have appeared after Lynn Sha resisted\nthe demon tide. This? You mean Lynn\nShiao is really colluding with the\ndemons? That's terrifying. Thinking\nabout it this way, it makes sense that\nhe with only an F-rank talent could take\nfirst place in the first round of hero\nrankings. I think it might be because\nLynn Shia did something wrong and is\nbeing hunted by demons. After all, he's\nso handsome. In short, it's a messy\nsituation. He a trembled with rage.\nYou're talking nonsense. Boss Lyn Sha\nhas killed far more demons than you\nhave. Dinglay stepped forward\nimmediately. Everyone, don't label Lynn\nShiao so casually. The main gods will\ncheck him when he enters the battlefield\nof 10,000 races. If Lynn Sha were a\ndemon, he would have been discovered\nlong ago. Furthermore, his daily grind\nof grinding monsters from dawn till dusk\nis also a proactive measure in\npreparation for the arrival of the black\nflame lord. Everyone immediately came to\ntheir senses. Right. Right. I don't\nthink Lyn Sha is a bad guy either.\nBostoning Lelay is right to remind me.\nHowever, the image of a miserable ranger\nlord who under the immense pressure of\nbeing a lord in the official district\nworks tirelessly from dawn till dusk\nfrantically grinding monsters for a\nglimmer of hope is thus established.\nHowever, if Lynn Shiao is a big shot,\nwhy doesn't he act like Dinglay, using\nhis strength to eliminate evil and bring\nprosperity to our newbie zone? That's\nright. Dinglay is a true leader who\ncares about everyone's well-being. Lyn\nShia is no longer worthy of that title.\nDingle is the real boss. Dinglay is\nawesome. The compliments of the crowd,\nDing Lay logged off with satisfaction.\nOn the other side, the masked man had\nbeen waiting for a long time. His\ndissatisfied tone came through. Humph\nDing Lay, this isn't how you use the\nslaying talisman. This isn't how you\nwaste time, Ding Lay said calmly. Wong\nSu, are you still concerned about those\nfew extermination talismans you have?\nThe masked man was taken aback. What do\nyou mean? Don't you know the purpose of\nthose three people who came from another\nregion? Dinglay asked rhetorically. What\ndoes this have to do with me? I just\nwant to kill Lyn Sha. Wait, you mean\nthose three people came to help Lynn\nShiao? Exactly. One of these three is\nChu Yusi's most outstanding student. I\nheard their names at the Gangdong\ncommendation ceremony. It's no\ncoincidence that all three of them came\nfrom different districts at the same\ntime. But just now, with just a few\nwords, I put them on the opposite side\nof all 89,757\nnewbie lords. So, you're still worried\nabout those few slang talismans you\nhave? The masked man was silent for a\nmoment, then slowly said, \"It seems I\nunderestimated you, Dinglay, Dinglay. He\nhe I'm much stronger than you think. You\ncan send reinforcements to Black Flame\nnow, Lyn Sha. Someone might want to\nprotect him. You'll have to pay a higher\nprice to deal with Lyn Sha. Give me a\nfew more slaying talismans, and I'll\ntake care of those three for you.\" The\nmasked man frowned. You really can take\ndown a player ranked higher than you?\nDingle, huh? A clay chicken and a clay\ndog. Chapter 87. Not a genius versus a\nreal genius. At this moment near the\nHolian Mountains around the territory of\nHeay and two Sha by Chian Jolie Wong Bo\nand Pan Sha Yu however got together. The\nthree were clearly very familiar with\neach other. They didn't exchange\npleasantries upon meeting and\nimmediately set off clearing out wild\nmonsters as they moved towards the\nlocation of Calabash Pass. There are\nstill many monsters here that haven't\nbeen cleared out. Jilly was a slender,\ntall man with long hair tied back. He\nwore a denim vest that revealed his\nmuscular arms. Judging from his attire,\nhe resembled a stylish man with ethnic\nminority elements. He led several squads\nof soldiers and two heroes walking and\nobserving as he spoke. There are too\nmany low-level monsters left. The\noriginal lord didn't bother farming them\nat all. He a rough voice responded to\nhim. It was Wong Bo. This was a burly\nyoung man with a full beard and bulging\nmuscles that strained his clothes. He\nwas clearly a walking embodiment of\nmasculinity. It was all the work of\nthose two thugs. Wong Bodeo, I heard\nthat the lord here was killed on the\nsecond day after the server opened. So\nof course, no one is clearing out the\nmonsters. Wongbo suddenly sidestepped\nand slashed with his greatsword, killing\na dark elf thief who was trying to\nambush him. A mere rare unit dares to\nlaunch a sneak attack on me. Have the\nmonsters here never encountered a true\nmaster? It seems like things will go\nsmoothly for us from here on out. We'll\nbe able to get to Hulu Pass soon and see\nthat person. The group leading their\ntroops charged forward with great\nferocity, advancing rapidly. Shau, why\naren't you saying anything? Are you\nunhappy about being assigned here by the\ncity lord? Halfway through the journey,\nJill asked the person at the back of the\ngroup, who looked like a cute little boy\nand appeared delicate and frail,\nremained silent for a moment before\nslowly saying, \"That's true to some\nextent. You said the three of us are the\nmost sought after top newcomers in the\nnewbie zone this year. Jolie, Wongbo,\nall three of us have a level lord\ntalents. If you continue to develop in\nyour respective beginner zones, you will\neventually achieve good results and\nenter the official zones. In particular,\nJulie can strive to be the first to\nreach level three and obtain the reward\nof adding one hero slot just because of\na single sentence from the city lord.\nThe three of us rushed here to protect a\nnovice whose lordly talent is only at\nthe F rank. Upon hearing this, Julie\nchuckled and said, \"We've been training\nsoldiers for a thousand days to use them\nfor one. The city lord has treated us\nwell, and we should step forward at this\ncritical moment. None of us are\nconfident that we can defeat Black Flame\nfrom the official zone on our own, but\nthe three of us together still have a\nchance. The three of us, three geniuses\ncrammed into a tiny newbie zone. There\naren't even enough resources to go\naround.\" Pans Shan Yu was still somewhat\ndissatisfied. Lord City Lord sacrificed\nthe futures of the three of us just to\nprotect someone of unknown strength who\ntriggered a special demonic tide. Isn't\nthis a good deal? Didn't the city lord\ngive us sufficient compensation? Jilly\nstill didn't seem to care much. Anyway,\nI don't think I could be a match for\nDugu Jalon. Adding a hero spot is just a\npipe dream. It's surveillance plus\nprotection, Wongbo said in a rough\nvoice. The city lord's hint is quite\nclear. If Lin Shiao is indeed powerful,\nwe will protect him. If not, we give up.\nIf someone has the ability but goes\nastray, Wong Bo&lt;unk&gt;'s voice turned\ncold. Kill him. As they spoke, the three\nof them finally arrived at Hulu Pass.\nUse perspective. Use eagle-eye. The\nthree of them lay on the ground quietly\nobserving the distance. After a long\nwhile, all three of them let out a soft\nsigh. What do you think? Nearly half of\nthe monsters near Hulu Pass have not\nbeen cleared, including highle,\nmid-level, and low-level monsters. His\nplaying style is chaotic and\ndisorganized. He doesn't follow the\nmethod of starting with the easy and\nprogressing to the difficult to improve\nhimself. The same goes for mineral\nresources. There are ordinary mineral\nveins, rare mineral veins, and upgraded\nmineral veins. Some have been occupied,\nand some have not. Why is he mining rare\nmineral veins now instead of\nsystematically mining the resources he\nneeds most? Is he going to recruit epic\nunits? Does he have it? I think he's\nlost his composure like a headless fly,\nfrantically grasping its straws,\ndesperately trying to find a way out.\nAlas, what a pity. The three remained\nsilent for a while, then continued to\nobserve. The fact that no military unit\nwas seen guarding the mine suggests that\nhis forces may be insufficient. The\nminers are flower fairies. I've heard\nthat some families train low-level\ntroops to do other things, which is a\npretty good tactic. I see the log cabins\nin the forest. Julie's tone was somewhat\ndoubtful. He did indeed take over a\nphantom archer's lair, but I didn't see\nany phantom archers training. Wong B\ntilted his head. Aren't there a few\nunder the wooden house? But those\nPhantom shooters weren't wearing\noveralls. Julie Dao, shouldn't he be\naccelerating the training of Phantom\nArcher to become Gust Archer at this\npoint? Wong Bo and Pan Shan Yu exchanged\na glance, somewhat taken aback.\nOveralls, huh? Julie said, \"Look, I\nspecially asked for a group of phantom\narchers, and they've all been trained\naccording to his method.\" Julie\nbeckoned, summoning a squad of phantom\narchers. white overalls hung on green\nleather armor, which combined with the\nelves flawless faces gave them a unique\ncharm. However, the phantom archer's\nexpressions were somewhat unnatural.\nOnly in this way can you upgrade to\nbecome a gust archer, Julie said\nproudly. Wong B/Phan Yu. After a moment\nof silence, the group shook their heads\nand said, \"Let's report to the city\nlord. Lyn Xiao&lt;unk&gt;so&lt;unk&gt;s Dao heart\nhas been broken, and he's in complete\ndisarray. He's no longer the genius he\nonce was from Jangdong number three\nmiddle school. Lord, you are truly a\ngenius. Soldering's excitement was\npalpable. We can even climb up cliffs to\nlaunch a sneak attack here. Lyn Sha led\nthe group and swiftly and decisively\nwiped out a large harpy gathering point\nat the top of the cliff. This is all\nthanks to Liong Yu and the White Spear\nsoldiers. nodded to the valiant female\ngeneral and Shin Leong Yu also gave Lin\nShiao a crisp military salute. They are\nexperts in mountain warfare. Also,\nalthough harpies are a rare unit, there\nare too many of them and they are timid.\nIf we launch a frontal assault, a large\nnumber of harpies will fly away and flee\nonly to return after we leave. Lyn Sha\nsaid this would prevent us from\ncapturing this terrain or we would have\nto spend a lot of time hunting down the\nbanshee. You know what we need most\nright now is time. Soldering gave Lynn\nShia an exaggerated bow to express his\nrespect. Your lordship is truly the\nchosen one. He he just a little bit of\ncommon sense from ancient Chinese books.\nNothing to brag about. If true military\ngeniuses and strategists like Li Jing,\nSunsu, Chinqing Xi, and Juulang were to\ncome, attacking a place like this would\nbe child's play of schemes. You bunch of\nclueless foreigners are probably going\nto be dumbfounded. Lyn Sha thought to\nhimself. We've already taken over a\nthird of the Holian Mountains today.\nIt's getting late. Time to head back.\nLyn Sha said, \"At most, we will be able\nto occupy the entire Calabash Mountain\nRange the day after tomorrow. Monsters\nand resources in the entire Calabash\nValley will be mine. Now return to the\nterritory and recruit Chinese soldiers.\"\nChapter 88. Dual barracks begin mass\nproduction. The joy of flame. At night,\nLin Shiao, who had rushed back to his\nterritory, took off his cloak and placed\nit in Ba's hands. Then he told Ba a\njoke, which made her laugh so hard she\ntrembled with joy. Hearing the system\nnotification that his gold coins had\nincreased by tens of thousands.\nLinhao&lt;unk&gt;s eyelids twitched several\ntimes. With the bug involving Baoi, the\ngold coin bonus is calculated as a\npercentage. The more money you have, the\nmore you get. A smile worth a thousand\npieces of gold is indeed well worth it.\nEveryone sat down to eat spirit rice\nporridge and grilled fish. The spirit\nfish in the epic pond have matured, and\nthe golden legend farmer caught more\nthan a dozen to nourish everyone.\nFeeling the attribute bonuses from the\nlegendary spirit rice porridge and the\nepic spirit fish, Lynn Shia happily\nstretched. As long as I keep eating and\nhave enough time, I can boost the\nfarmer's four stats to the point where\nhe can instantly kill a holy dragon. No\nwonder the powerful families in the\nofficial district are so strong. The\nstrong always get stronger. Just then,\nboth barracks were completed. Barracks\nquality average level one. Defense 2,00\nrecruitable unit level common.\nRecruitable units militia 50 food units.\nSpearman 100 food units recruitment\nspeed 6 3 hours/person\nupgrade materials required omitted as\nexpected ordinary level barracks can\nonly recruit ordinary soldiers Lin Shia\ndidn't even glance at the upgrade\nmaterials and simply waved his hand\nusing the Hashia tokens ascension\nfunction and adding the energy of the\nmyriad races battlefield. A double\nascension is performed simultaneously\nascending two identical buildings, the\nbarracks. A flash of light and the two\nbarracks immediately changed. The\ntowering guard towers, sharp barricades,\nand magnificent barracks were quickly\ncompleted, all gleaming with golden\nlight. Two legendary gold quality\nbarracks have appeared. Barracks quality\ngolden legend level one defense 50,000.\nRecruitable unit tiers common gold\nlegendary. Recruitable units militia 50\nfood units. Spearmen 100 food units.\nSwordsmen and shieldmen 250 food 100\nwood iron ore. Swordsmen 350 food 150\niron ore. Archers 500 food units 100\ngold 100 wood. Emo Dao Iron Guard, 1,000\nunits of food, 1,000 gold coins, 1,000\nrefined iron, 10 gems. Divine Archer,\n1,000 units of food, 1,000 gold coins,\n1,000 fine wood, 10 crystals. White\nShafted Spearman, 1,000 units of food,\n1,000 gold coins, 1,000 fine wood, 10\nsulfur. Recruitment speed, 6 3\nhours/person.\nUpgrade materials required, none. The\nprice of legendary gold troops is high.\nThe materials required to recruit just\none troop are almost enough for other\nlords to upgrade a guild. Not to mention\nthe rare materials, which most people\ncan't even gather. You really do get\nwhat you pay for, but I'm not worried. I\nhave enough resources and my talent is\nlevel five. I make money fast. Plus, I\nhave a beautiful concubine whose smile\ncan bring in tens of thousands of\ndollars. Lyn Sha nodded. A military camp\nis recruiting mo Dao iron guards. A\nmilitary camp is recruiting archers with\nsharpshooting crossbows. Tomorrow, Pay\nMin's wandering knights pavilion and\nChin Leangu's Tusi village will be\ncompleted. Recruiting White Spear\nsoldiers directly from the Tusi village\nshould be just as fast. There are 6 days\nleft until the black flame descends. We\ncan recruit two people tonight and 48\nmore in the remaining 6 days for a total\nof 50 people if nothing unexpected\nhappens in addition to the existing\ntroop types. Lyn Xiao's theory suggests\nthat he can obtain 60 MO Dao iron\nguards, 60 divine arm archers, and 60\nwhite pole spear soldiers. Moreover, he\nstill had several recruitment tokens\nleft and used just in case. After\nfinishing his business, Lin Shiao opened\nthe chat channel. He left me a message\nwith speculations emerging about Lin\nXiao&lt;unk&gt;'s cowardice and whether he was\ncolluding with the demons. Heay left a\nmessage for Lin Shiao, asking him to\ncome out and explain himself to avoid\ndamaging his reputation. Lyn Sha\ncarefully examined the chat channel and\nfinally understood what had happened.\nDing Lay has been shining brightly\nlately and has even started to become\nupright, having already dealt with\nseveral bloodthirsty lords. Lyn Shao\npondered to himself that his strength\nwas indeed greater than he had imagined,\nand he seemed to be hiding something\nbecause he appeared to have obtained an\nepic great sword. What exactly was he\nplanning to do? Was he really going to\neliminate evil? Dinglays subtle writing\nstyle seems to be used to belittle and\nisolate people. A leopard can't change\nits spots. As for the three experts who\ncame from other regions, Lyn Sha saw\nthat none of them came out to answer, so\nhe had no way of guessing their\nintentions. Wait a minute. From my\nmemory, it seems that Julie was a genius\nstudent at Gangdong City Direct School,\nand Chu Yusi was the honorary principal\nof Jangdong City Direct School. Oh, this\ncould it be for me? Lyn Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s mind\nraced. A moment later, he left messages\nfor Hi, Tu Shan by Chin and Chuningming,\ntelling them to be wary of Ding Lelay\nand to be careful of the three experts\nfrom other regions. He also advised them\nnot to start a conflict if the other\nparty had no malicious intent and to\npatrol and guard their respective\nterritories more often and to report any\nabnormalities to him immediately. here.\nAfter listening to the intelligence\nreport from Ju Lee and others, Chu Yusi,\nthe city lord of Jangd Dong, shut down\nthe communication. After a long while,\nhe slowly shook his head. Lyn Shiao, are\nyou really panicking? This doesn't seem\nlike what the first prophet predicted.\nAnd recently, there have been rumors\nthat you have an entangled story with\nthe demons. Chu Yusi reopened the\ncommunication and connected with\nChuunga. The next day, Dinglay killed\nthree more notorious bloodthirsty lords,\nearning widespread praise. Lyn Sha still\ngot up early to grind monsters and\ncontinued to conquer one stronghold\nafter another on the Calabash mountain\nrange. On the Calabash Mountains, the\nWhite Spear soldiers appeared like\ndivine warriors descending from the\nheavens, suddenly appearing behind the\nmonster at the mountaintop. In a short\ntime with the buffs from skills such as\nbloodlust, barbarian warrior, and son of\nthe mountain, Chin Leong Yu led 20 white\nspear spearmen to successfully sweep\naway the 50 superior unit wyverns at the\ntop of the cliff. Excellent. Lyn Shao\nsincerely praised Chin Leang Yu and her\nWhite Spear soldiers. There's not much\nof the Holian Mountains left to be\ncaptured. Tomorrow, we'll divide our\nforces and make sure we take the entire\nHolian Mountains. On the third day, Lynn\nSha continued to work from dawn till\ndusk, using the routes in the memory\npalace to fight monsters every second.\nOnly the last large section of the\nCalabash Mountain Range remained to be\nconquered. Meanwhile, Dingle once again\nkilled four bloodthirsty lords who had\nharmed others, and his popularity and\nreputation continued to soar, making him\nalmost a representative figure who could\ncommand a large following in the entire\nnewbie area. It's noon now. Hey men, at\nthe last section of the Calabash\nMountains, there is a stronghold that is\nvery difficult for a large army to\nreach. Lyn Sha said, \"Chin Leong Yu and\nI will take another route. Pay Min, you\nshould take the initiative and deal with\nthe most dangerous part. The icebirds\nthere are epic monsters, not something\nthat ordinary people can deal with.\" Pay\nMinowed with his hands clasped in\ngreeting and was about to leave when\nLynn Sha called him back. Here's an epic\ngreat sword, perfect for countering the\nfrostbird. You can use it, too. Lyn Sha\nreached out and pulled out the\nAshbringer, then tossed it to Pay Min.\nPay Min, who was known as the sword\nsaint and loved swords like his first\nlove, stared wideeyed at the sight. An\nepic level great sword. My lord, what is\nthe name of this sword? Ah, just an\nordinary epic weapon. Its name is the\npleasure of fire. Hey men, this name\nfeels a bit strange. Chapter 89. Finding\na trouble starting a war. Meanwhile,\nDing Lelay, who had already become a\nrepresentative figure and the de facto\nleader of the 89757\nnewbie zone, who was out farming in the\nwild due to a lack of resources. Get out\nof the way, Pans Shanu directly warned\nDinglay. I'm ranked fifth in the long\nnon- newbie zone and you're ranked\nninth, so you should probably move down\na bit. Don't get in my way while I'm\nfarming. What Pans Shan Yu didn't know\nwas that ever since he killed more than\na dozen bloodthirsty lords who had\nmurdered his own people, Dinglay would\ngo live every day from time to time to\nlet everyone see his prowess. \"I'm\nsorry,\" Dinglay said politely on the\nother end. \"I have no intention of\noffending anyone, but I am in a hurry to\nget rid of the few scoundrels in the\nnewbie area, so please do not hinder me.\nI didn't stop you. I got here first.\nThis is where I farmed monsters and took\nover resources. Pans Shan Yu corrected.\nAccording to the rules of the\nbattlefield of 10,000 races, I have the\nfinal say in this area. You'd better\ntake a detour. A sense of seriousness\nflashed through Ding Lays mind. Sure\nenough, none of the top 10 were easy to\ndeal with. My friend, I really have an\nurgent matter to attend to. Please make\nway for me. Otherwise, if the lord I'm\ntargeting escapes, it will be a huge\nthreat to all the newbies in the newbie\nzone. Pan Shan Yu stood ramrod straight.\nNo. Dinglays polite attitude and his\nwillingness to humble himself to\neliminate evil in the newbie zone\ncontrast sharply with Pan Sha Yu&lt;unk&gt;s\narrogant and unforgiving manner,\ncreating a strong contrast. The live\nstream was overwhelmingly in support of\nDing Lelay and condemnation of Pans Sha\nYu. Where did this person come from?\nThey're not from our district, so they\ndon't care about us at all. Look at how\neager he is to seize the mine. Could it\nbe that Dinglay was right? He's here to\ngrab resources and power. Upon seeing\nthis, Ding Lay simply smiled as if he\nhad suddenly realized something. Dingle,\nmy friend, you're doing just fine in\nother districts. Why are you coming\nhere? We have our own resources and\nyou're trying to steal them from us.\nThat's not a good idea. Pan Shan, you\nthink I wanted to come here? You think I\nwanted to steal your resources? I'm\ndoing fine in other districts, and I'm\nalready unlucky enough to have to come\nhere and compete with you for resources.\nDon't bother me. Ding Lays eyes narrowed\nsharply. Friend, if you're hindering me\nfrom upholding justice for my brothers,\nthen I'm sorry. Pans Shan Yu also lost\nhis temper. Ding Lay was accusing him\none accusation after another,\nrelentlessly attacking his morale. So he\nroared. If you're so capable, then go\nfor it. You're only knife and you think\nyou can take me down. 10 minutes later,\nthe chat channel exploded again. Ding\nLay defeated Pan Shan Yu, giving all the\nnative lords in the 89757\nnewbie zone a sense of relief. Lasted\nthree moves against Ding Lay. At that\nmoment, Lin Shiao, who was killing\nmonsters, received a call from Chufinga.\nLin Shiao, tell me seriously. Don't lie\nto me, Chufinga said anxiously. Are you\nhaving an affair with a demon? Fungo? Of\ncourse not. Lyn Sha responded while\nelegantly slaying a wild monster. His\nskillful archery and horsemanship making\nChufunga extremely envious caused by a\nsuccubus that appeared out of nowhere.\nLyn Sha then told Chufinga the whole\nstory. That's great. Chufinga breathed a\nsigh of relief after learning the whole\nstory. The old man also sent three\npeople to protect you. They reported\nthat you were as chaotic as a fly and\nyou even missed a lot of wild monsters\nnear your own lord's manor. What?\nThey've all gotten near my lord's manor.\nLyn Sha felt a chill run down his spine.\nLast time it was the beautiful girl who\nwas lying on the edge of Calabash\nMountain observing him. And today it was\nthese three experts lying on the edge of\nCalabash Mountain observing him. This is\nbecause his lord's manor is located at\nthe mouth of the valley and anyone who\ngoes up the mountain can see it all.\nThings shouldn't happen more than three\ntimes. We can't let this happen again.\nLyn Sha thought to himself. The\nadvantage of Halians terrain is that it\nis easy to defend and difficult to\nattack, but the disadvantage is that it\nis easy for people to spy on it from a\nhigh vantage point. Although most of\nHulu Mountain is steep cliffs, making it\nimpossible for a large army to break\nthrough, Lin Shiao could not tolerate\nbeing constantly spied on. Just then,\nChufinga turned her head and glanced at\nthe chat channel. What? Pans Shanu lost.\nHe was defeated by Dinglay. Lyn Sha also\nclicked into the chat channel and\nbrowsed through it. Dinglays strength\nseems to be getting stronger and\nstronger. Chufinga shook his head and\nsideighed. I really don't know what kind\nof talent this kid has. Then he said\nnervously, \"These three are all my\nallies after all. I need to go to the\nscene and try to persuade them not to\nfight over such a trivial matter. If it\nweren't for the old man's restrictions,\nthey wouldn't have been able to openly\nstate that their purpose was to protect\nyou, and so many misunderstandings\nwouldn't have arisen.\" Chufinga logged\noff in a hurry while Lin Sha remained\nsilent and deep in thought. Dinglays\nactions were definitely suspicious. He\ndeliberately incited the new lords to\nfight against these three, thus creating\na persona for himself of protecting the\nnew lords by driving out outsiders.\nDinglay must know something. He probably\nguessed that these three people came for\nme. Lyn Sha paced back and forth.\nAssuming Dinglay figured out that the\nthree experts were there for me, he must\nhave guessed that their purpose was to\nprotect me against the black flame lord.\nYet he still indiscriminately labeled\nthem and created antagonism. Unless Ding\nLay is specifically targeting me, then\nDinglay is also my enemy. This explains\nthe suspicious situation of him suddenly\nacquiring a large number of rare and\nsuperior units. Dinglay has already\ndefected to others, even directly to the\nBlack Flame Lord Wong Su or the\nCelestial Beings organization. Lyn\nXiao&lt;unk&gt;s expression turned serious.\nHowever, Dinglay kept his word and\nspared Tu Shawn by Chien when the castle\nwas destroyed. And recently, he has\nstarted using his abilities to hunt down\nthe bloodthirsty lords who have\ncommitted crimes. From the current\nperspective, he hasn't done anything\nobviously bad. Could it be that this is\na requirement of his talent? Lyn Sha\nused his memory to recall Ding Lays\nevery move. From the moment he entered\nthe beginner area, he made frequent and\nhigh-profile appearances. They make\ngrand pronouncements, enjoy showing off\nin front of others, and mostly succeed.\nWhen they fail, it's usually due to\ntheir own unintentional sabotage. Even\non the night he and two Shawn by Chin\nwere destroying the castle, he first\ncame to him online to exchange words.\nSlowly, a guest began to form in his\nmind. Dinglay, having already dealt with\nPans Shan Yu, has temporarily shut down\nthe live stream. The masked man, Wong Su\ncalled. Well done, Dinglay. We found out\nthrough relevant channels that these\nthree are all from the Jangdong City\nLords faction. Their sudden transfer to\nyour newbie zone is most likely to\nprotect Lin Sha. All three are geniuses.\nIf they work together, they can cause\nsome trouble for Black Flame. Thank\ngoodness for you. You've already\ncrippled one of them beforehand. Given\nthat Lynn Shiao has powerful backers, I\nhave also applied to my superiors to\nupgrade all of Black Flame's troop types\nagain. To ensure absolute safety, I will\ninform the lord that once you come up to\nthe official area, you can officially\njoin our organization and become a\ntrainee member. He Ding Lay wiped his\nlong sword and put it into his spatial\nstorage. We&lt;unk&gt;ll see when the time\ncomes. The masked man paused, and Ding\nLay always acted like he was very\npowerful, which sometimes infuriated\nhim. Then, Ding Lay waved his hand, took\nout a giant sword emanating a chilling\naura, and solemnly said, \"The truly\nformidable character has arrived.\" Ding.\nPlayers Julie and Wong Bo have used a\npunitive token on player Dinglay.\nDinglay casually opened the live stream\nand walked over. Chapter 90. One against\nthree. A mysterious man appears. The\nsecond and fourth place winners in the\nbeginner area of Long Nan district used\na smite on Ding Lay at the same time.\nDingle, seemingly unfazed, simply opened\nthe live stream. All the lords who had\nspare time quickly flooded into the live\nstream, cheering and supporting Dinglay.\nDamn it, where did these petty\nscoundrels come from? Seeing that our\ndistrict is peaceful, they come from\nanother district to steal our resources.\nGo Dinglay. Show the might of our 89,757\nnewbie zone. Dinglay is much better than\nLin Shia who only causes trouble because\nhe helps us fight evil and eliminates\nevil. Dinglay, I want to have your\nbabies. Boss Dinglay, give them a good\nbeating. Exactly. You chased one away\nand two more came. Are you trying to rob\nus outright? You're scared now that the\nfifth place team has lost. Now the\nsecond and fourth place teams are coming\nat you together. Two against one. What\nkind of heroes are you? The chat channel\nwas filled with insults and abuse\ndirected at Julie and Wong Bo, including\nangry messages tagging them by name. But\nas soon as the two crossed over to the\nother district, they were smeared with\ndirt and they couldn't reveal the real\nreason why they came. They were truly\nsuffering in silence. The two men\nleading the heroes and soldiers slowly\nwalked to Dinglays position. Dinglay,\naccording to the rules of the\nbattlefield of all races, you are in the\nwrong. Julie said in a loud voice. You\nforcibly passed through and attacked the\nterritory that Pans Shan Yu had already\noccupied, which constitutes a malicious\nattack. Dinglay shrugged. I'm sorry. I\nwas just doing my duty to eliminate evil\nfor all the lords in our district. It\nwas an emergency. Look, after I defeated\nPans Shan Yu, I went and killed a\nbloodthirsty lord, didn't I? Julie said\nloudly. But it was indeed you who\nstarted the trouble first, so it's\nperfectly justifiable for the two of us\nto use the punitive talisman on you.\nThis time, we're just asking for Dinglay\ninterrupted. You just want to kill me.\nJill was stagnant for a time. Dinglay\nrattled off a string of words. So you\ndon't need so many reasons to avenge Pen\nShanu. Just because you are strong and\nwe are weak, do you have the right to\noppress us? You three top experts,\naren't you just here to steal resources\nfrom our district? Anyone who gets in\nyour way, you take them down. For\neveryone you take down, two stronger\nones will come. Come on. I, Dinglay,\nwould rather die than surrender. I'd\nrather stand and be killed by you than\nbow my head and beg for mercy.\nDingle&lt;unk&gt;s words evoked a profound\nsense of sorrow and shared experience\namong everyone in the 89757\nnewbie zone. The rage of all the lords\nwho were living in fear in the newbie\nzones was ignited. Defeat these three\noutsiders. Outsider, get out. Go\nDinglay. Seeing that the situation was\nout of control and that Dingle was\nconstantly labeling them, Wong Bo, who\nalready had a short temper, could no\nlonger tolerate it and rushed forward.\nFine, fine. I'll let you die standing up\nnow. Wong Bo pulled out a large cleaver\nwith a flick of his wrist. His burly\nfigure combined with the weapon that\ngleamed with purple light gave him an\noverwhelming sense of intimidation. Both\nof his heroes are also exceptional\nstrength type heroes, and the soldiers\nthey lead are either muscular barbarian\nwarriors or mountain giants. Dingle,\nalong with his two outstanding heroes\nand their troops, also went to meet\nthem. Jolie watched silently from the\nsidelines. His original intention was\njust to teach Ding Lay a lesson, but he\nnever expected it to develop to this\nextent. They made themselves look like\nthey were against all the lords in the\nentire 89,757\nnewbie zone. Wong Bo and Dingle are\nlocked in battle, an outstanding hero\nagainst another outstanding hero, and\ntheir troop types are basically evenly\nmatched. On one side are the shameful\nand barbaric invaders. On the other side\nare the defenders forced to fight back\nto protect their homeland. In the live\nstream and chat channels, everyone was\ncheering for Ding Lay and applauding\nhim. Just a few moves. With a loud bang,\nDing Lay raised his great sword,\nknocking away Wong B's large cleaver and\nthen kicked him more than 10 m away.\nDinglay has once again defeated top\nplayers from other regions. And it's\nWong Bo who's ranked fourth. Damn it.\nWongbo wiped the blood from the corner\nof his mouth and charged forward again.\nThen he was knocked away again. Enough,\nWongbo. Dingle pointed his great sword\ndiagonally at the enemy, saying, \"I'll\nspare your life since you haven't harmed\nour district's lord. I, Dingle, am not a\nperson who kills indiscriminately.\" In\nthe live broadcast room, Dinglay&lt;unk&gt;s\ncharm captivated countless young women.\nJulie, you're next. Frustrated by the\nvarious setbacks since crossing the\nborder, Julie snorted coldly, pulled out\ntwo long narrow curved blades and said,\n\"Dinglay, my troops and heroes are all\nbetter than yours, and I won't bully\nyou. How about we duel one-on-one\nbetween the lords, Dinglay, I don't need\nyour fake pity. You're seriously\nunderestimating me. How can I weaken you\nif I don't kill your troops?\" Dinglay\nthought to himself. His recruitment\ntokens were all given to him by Wong Su,\nso he didn't care if his soldiers died.\nJulie still tried to resolve the\ndispute. Dingle, the three of us came\nhere not to seize resources. In fact,\nwhat we've occupied are simply absolute\nprivate territories near the Lord&lt;unk&gt;'s\nmanor. Shut up. If you want war, then\nlet's fight. Stop with all this\nnonsense. Dinglay drew his giant sword\nand charged out once more. At that\nmoment, his image fighting for all the\nlords in the newbie zone was deeply\netched in everyone's minds. At that\nmoment, Dinglay&lt;unk&gt;s image and\nreputation in everyone's mind reached\ntheir peak. The light stung Lin Xiao's\neyes as he quietly watched his\nperformance in the live stream. Dinglay\nleaped up and chopped with all his\nmight. Just one strike. The Julie simter\nwas cleaved away. The man was also sent\nflying backward before Julie could make\nanother move. Dinglays giant sword was\nalready pointed at his throat. I've\nlost. Julie looked dejected. He couldn't\nunderstand how his powerful talent could\nhave led to a loss to Dinglay. Could\nDinglay possibly possess an S-rank\ntalent? I can spare your lives, but you\nall must get out of here. Dingle stood\nhigh above like an unassalable king. You\nthree, and you call yourselves top\nplayers in the newbie zone. You're\nutterly pathetic. Even if all three of\nyou attacked together, you wouldn't be a\nmatch for me. Now go back to where you\ncame from. At this moment, Ding Lay is\nmajestic and all inspiring. Dinglay\nturned around and faced the live\nbroadcast room. Everyone, how does Ding\nLay compare to Lin Sha? The live stream\nfell silent for a few seconds, then\nerupted into unanimous praise. Ding Lay\nis the absolute pinnacle of combat power\nin our region. Although Lynn Shiao can\nsmash the abyss demon with one hand,\nDing Lay can take down three top experts\nall by himself, Ding Lay is clearly\nsuperior, Ding Lay is awesome. Lyn Shia,\nwho is quietly watching Ding Lay in the\nlive stream, also twitched at the corner\nof his mouth. Dinglay really seems to\nharbor resentment towards himself. If\nyou don't bother me, fine. But if you\ndo, then I won't be polite. Just then,\nChufinga arrived with his troops. Upon\nseeing this scene, he immediately became\nanxious. Stop, Ding Lang. Chufunga\nroared. You have no right to drive them\naway. They're just here to help. Dinglay\nsmiled faintly. Oh, then ask everyone if\nthey agree. Shufinga didn't need to open\nthe chat channel to know that public\nopinion was surging and all of it was to\ndrive these three people away. The old\nman's plan was ruined just like that.\nLyn Shia is in danger this time with no\none to help him. Dinglay is just too\nstrong. Isn't he? Julie, Wong, Bo, and\nPan Shan Yu are all wellestablished\nmasters who have been in the top 20 of\nthe martial arts competition. They are\nmuch stronger than Ding Lay, who is\nranked outside the top 50 in the martial\narts competition. But Dinglay seems to\nget stronger the more he plays. Although\nChufingo was arrogant, he believed he\nhad no way to defeat Julie. And at this\nmoment, he had no confidence to fight\nagainst Ding Lay. In an instant, in this\nsmall area, five top experts gathered\ntogether and hundreds of soldiers faced\noff against each other, eyeing each\nother menacingly, creating an extremely\ntense atmosphere. No, we must save these\nthree friendly soldiers. Chufinga\ngritted her teeth and decided to reveal\nthe secret. Just then, a clear voice\nrang out. Excuse me, everyone. Could you\nplease make way? You're blocking my way\nto Grind Monsters. A man dressed in a\nlong white robe with his long hair tied\nback, a gentle and refined appearance,\nsharp features, and a handsome and sunny\ndemeanor, walked out slowly with his\nhands behind his back. Chapter 91. Who\nexactly are you? Just a hero? Everyone\nwas startled. Who is this? No one had\never seen him before. It's like a group\nof dogs fighting and suddenly a\nnonchalant cat tries to cross the road.\nThe dejected wanderer tilted his head,\nseemingly surprised that no one was\ngoing to let him pass, and continued on\nhis way. Treat everyone as nothing.\nStop. Dingle couldn't tolerate anyone\nchallenging his authority. Who are you?\nThe man did not answer and continued\nwalking. Stop. If you take another step,\nI'll attack. Dingle pointed his great\nsword at the man. Are you the\nreinforcements these three foreign lords\nbrought here? The man didn't even lift\nhis eyelids. A good dog doesn't block\nthe way. Dinglay paused. Realizing this\nwas blatant mockery. It would have a\nhuge negative impact on his talent. He\nhad to fight back. Without saying a\nword, his dozens of elite troops rushed\nforward. Before anyone could see what\nwas happening. A flash of white light\nappeared and dozens of soldiers were\ninstantly decapitated. The viewers in\nthe live stream gasped in shock. The two\nheroes charged out simultaneously, one\nin front and one behind to sandwich the\nman. Another flash of white light, and\nthe two heroes fell to the ground,\ncoughing up blood. The chat channel went\nsilent instantly. Dinglay snorted\ncoldly. You killed my men without a\nsecond thought. You deserve to die,\ngentlemen. Watch me slay this fiend.\nDinglay wielded his frost great sword\nwith lightning speed, launching a charge\nand leaping slash. Even the formidable\nJulie had fallen victim to this move. A\nlook of amazement flashed in the\nwhite-clad man's eyes. Another flash of\nwhite light, and the white robed man now\nheld a massive iceblue sword. Dinglay\ncoughed up blood and was thrown dozens\nof meters away. How? How could he be so\nstrong? Dinglay couldn't believe it.\nTens of thousands of people in the live\nstream fell into a deathly silence. The\nman in white held the ice blue great\nsword in his hand, overjoyed. This is\ntruly a fine sword. What's the name of\nthis sword? Dingle was furious. This is\nmy Frostorn. Give it back to me. After\nsaying that, he clenched his fist and\ncharged forward again. Then it bounced\nback even faster, spitting out another\nmouthful of blood. Who exactly are you?\nDinglay asked an alarm. Are you Dugu\nXiaolan, the top student in the second\ntier university? No, she's a woman. You\nare a player who quietly descended upon\nthe official zone. Everyone in the live\nstream was stunned. Just now, Ding Lay\ndefeated Julie in one move, displaying\nunparalleled skill and unstoppable\npower. But this man in white defeated\nDing Lelay in one move, and no one could\nsee how he made his move. This level of\nskill is something only top players in\nthe official server can achieve. But\nexactly when did a top player from the\nofficial server quietly descend upon\nthis newbie zone? No wonder, no wonder.\nThe man in white did not answer Dingle,\nbut instead quietly examined Frostorn\nand slowly said, \"No wonder that sword\nis called Flame of Delight. It was meant\nto be a pair with Frostorn.\" The man in\nwhite raised his head, \"Thank you for\nyour gift. I'll gladly accept this\nsword.\" Ding Lay lay on the ground\nshouting with a fierce but weak voice.\nWho are you? You stole my sword. This is\noutright robbery. I won't let you get\naway with this. None of the lords in the\nentire 89757\nnewbie zone will let you get away with\nthis. The man in white smiled faintly\nand said slowly, \"Rob, you sent your\ntroops to attack me first. I was\ndefending myself and gained the spoils.\nI did nothing wrong. and you're really\ngood at labeling people. Were those\nthree lords also falsely accused and\nslandered by you in the same way?\nUnfortunately, in the face of absolute\npower, your petty tricks are not worth a\nsecond glance. As soon as he finished\nspeaking, \"Holy crap, that's dazzling.\nSuch a showoff.\" Dinglay couldn't help\nbut spit out another mouthful of blood.\n\"Who exactly are you?\" Dingle was\npowerless to ask. He had been utterly\ndefeated. Upon hearing this, the man in\nwhite smiled faintly and said calmly, \"I\nam just one of Lin Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s heroes.\"\nDing Lay felt as if he had been struck\nby lightning. He stood there like a\nstatue, stunned and stammering. \"You,\nyou, you.\" Dinglay pointed at the man in\nwhite. \"Someone as powerful as you is\nmerely one of Lin Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s heroes.\"\n\"Am I powerful?\" The man in white was\ntaken aback, then smiled and shook his\nhead. This boy's abilities are less than\n1% of yours, Lord. Having said that, the\nman in white withdrew Frostorn,\nstraightened his body, and said in a\ndeep voice, \"Now, please make way. I\nstill need to grind monsters, otherwise\nthe Lord will punish me.\" With a whoosh,\neveryone stood in neat rows, making way\nfor each other. The man in white slowly\nwalked away. \"Your abilities are less\nthan 1% of mine.\" Lyn Sha smiled\nfaintly. Payman really knows how to\ntalk. I'll give him another five levels\nwhen he gets back. Lyn Shia then left\nthe still completely silent live stream\nand slowly turned around. Gentlemen,\nSword Saint Pay Min has eliminated the\nmost difficult mountaintop, Frostbird.\nOnly the last small section of the\nCalabash Mountains remains, just a minor\nepic level Cyclops cave. Follow me and\ncharge in. All the soldiers responded\nloudly and followed Lynn Shiao as he\ncharged into battle. On the mountain\nside, an epic quality cyclops had just\nemerged from a cave when the divine\narcher unleashed a volley of fire. Giant\nslayer, the divine archer was all a\ngiant of their time. Facing any creature\nlarger than themselves, they possessed\nunique techniques to deliver critical\nhits. Critical hit rate increased by 50%\nwhen attacking giants and the chance to\nhit a vital point increased by 50%. The\nCyclops died on the spot. The MO Dao\niron guards immediately rushed forward\nand blocked the entrance to the cave.\nAnother Cyclops charged out in a line,\nroaring angrily. Then Tang Yi slashed\nhim on the head. This cyclops was\nmassive and had a lot of health. One\nstrike didn't kill him. Instead, it\nfueled his ferocity. He was about to\nroar and retaliate when in a split\nsecond a flash of light appeared and\nTang Yi, the iron guard of the Mo Dao,\nstruck again. Reversal slash activated.\nThe Cyclops fell down in disbelief. Two\nmore Cyclops charged out, wielding giant\nwooden clubs made from tree trunks,\nready to smash them down on the iron\nguards of the Mod Dow. Soldering and his\nphantom archers launched a swift attack,\nactivating sniper. The cyclops had no\nchoice but to raise his hand to block,\navoiding having his only eye pierced.\nChin Leang Yu let out a sharp cry,\nholding her bright silver spear. Seizing\nthe opportunity, a flash of cold light\nappeared first, piercing through both\ncyclops simultaneously. Excellent. Lyn\nXiao&lt;unk&gt;s eyes lit up. Chin Lang\nYu&lt;unk&gt;s combat strength had greatly\nincreased after fighting in mountainous\nterrain. The effects of the King of the\nMountains are remarkable. Several more\ncyclopes rushed out of the cave,\nwielding huge stones, ready to smash\nthem down on the group. Several white\nspearmen had somehow appeared above the\ncave. With a roar, they activated\nbarbarian warriors. Barbarian warrior.\nThe white spear warrior can unleash a\nterrifying roar, stunning all creatures\nwithout mental resistance for 1 to 5\nseconds, depending on the warrior's\nstrength and level. After unleashing the\nroar, the White Spear warrior gains a\n20% increase to both strength and\nconstitution. It also directly triggers\nblood frenzy. Just as the Cyclops was\nreeling, the White Spear soldier leaped\ndown from the cliff, his White Spear\nplunging straight down, and the Cyclops\ninstantly fell to the ground. One\nCyclops after another charged out, but\nwith the combined efforts of Lin Shiao\nand his legendary units, they were\nutterly crushed and killed. Finally, a\ndeep resonant voice echoed through the\ncave. Stop fighting. We surrender.\nChapter 92. Heated discussion. Who is\nthe ceiling of combat power? The Cyclops\nsurrendered. Their cave was also\nconsidered a Cyclops lair where a\nCyclops leader was stationed. At this\nmoment, he was dejected. He led the few\nremaining cyclopes out, discarded the\ntree trunk and stones, and lay prostrate\non the ground. Very well, I accept your\nsurrender. Lynn Shiao checked the\nCyclopses attributes. Argos the Cyclops\nrace giant level 25, quality epic.\nAttributes: Strength 95, spirit 45,\nconstitution 70, soul 30, combat power\nrating 80 stars. Attributes added by\nskills, equipment, lord abilities, etc.\nrating. Skills, throwing boulders,\nuprooting trees, siege, bloodlust, and\nbrutality. A standard epic creature with\ndecent main attributes. Lyn Sha\nimmediately arrived at the cave and took\nover the nest. Now, there are only five\ncyclopes left, which is not enough.\nRecruit Cyclops. Three cyclopes emerged.\nThe epic level Cyclops reaches level 20\nwith all four stats being quite high.\nLyn Sha said to them, \"You should stay\nhere with the original leader.\" \"Huh?\"\nArgos asked, puzzled. \"My lord, we are\nall first rate warriors. Why don't you\nrecruit us into your army?\" Lyn Sha\nwaved his hand. \"No rush. There will be\ntasks for you when the time comes. For\nnow, stay at home and act as if nothing\nhas happened.\" Oh, Argos with his kind\nyet ferocious face had no choice but to\nlead the other seven cyclopes back.\nRemember this. I'm sending you back so\nyou can rest and recuperate. If you dare\nto rebel against me, my troops will come\nback for you. Lyn Sha gave him a warning\nfrom behind. Argos hurriedly turned\naround and saw the iron can holding a\ngiant crossbow, the fierce man holding a\nlong knife, and the dark-skinned man\nwith his arm exposed holding a white\nshafted spear. He couldn't help but\nshiver. What kind of evil spirits are\nthese? He immediately fell to the ground\nagain, hurriedly saying, \"I dare not.\nThe Cyclops is forever loyal to the\nLord.\" Ding. Your unit, the Cyclops\nArgos, has had its loyalty increased to\n70. Obedience is key. Ah, intimidation\nis also very effective in dealing with\nbarbaric and brutal troops. Lyn Sha\nnodded in satisfaction. That's more like\nit. Let's go. It was getting late, so\nLyn Sha led everyone back to the Lord's\nManor. Today was the perfect day to\nupgrade to level three. Just as Lin Sha\nwas heading home, little did he know\nthat a heated discussion had erupted in\nthe chat channel. Oh my god, did I see\nthat right? Dingle has lost. Having\ndefeated three masters in a row. Even\nthe nine Lee were no match for him and\nhe was actually defeated. Still defeated\nin one move and he's completely unfazed.\nThat man was merely a hero. But that\nhero is so cool, someone exclaimed.\nAlthough I've never seen him in clothes\nlike that before, I feel a faint sense\nof familiarity, as if I've seen him\nbefore. Stop focusing on the clothes.\nDidn't you see that heroic air about\nhim? He's one in a million. After\nsuppressing his frustration for so long,\nhe finally had a chance to speak. Huh?\nSuch a hero isn't even under my command.\nBoss Lin Shiao. Tu Shan by Chin. That's\nright. Didn't you hear him say that his\nabilities are less than 1% of boss Lynn\nXiao's? Now, who would dare to\nunderestimate boss Lin Shiao? The\nsmuggness of the two men was palpable,\nbut no one tacitly refuted it because\nthat hero is just too strong. If what he\nsaid is true, just how strong is Lyn\nSha? The image of Lin Sha\nsingle-handedly crushing the abyss demon\nthat day resurfaced in my mind. I think\nLin Shiao is the absolute pinnacle of\ncombat power in our district. While Ding\nLay is very strong, Lyn Sha is clearly\nstronger. Wow, our district is truly\nfull of hidden talents with so many\nmasters. Someone exclaimed. Master\nDinglay can sweep aside three top\nmasters, and Master Lyn Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s hero\ncan sweep aside Ding Lay. It's a pity I\nstill prefer Ding Lay. After all, he's a\nchampion of the people, fair and\nupright. Someone still tried to defend\nDinglay. It boss Lynn shall have the\npower to fight evil and uphold justice\nfor us. Yet he doesn't support the weak.\nDoesn't he know that with great power\ncomes great responsibility? Right? Just\nas everyone was agreeing, Tu Shan by\nChin suddenly asked, \"Ding Llay, were\nyou making an anonymous comment? You\nhave the nerve to try and make excuses\nfor yourself. I'm ashamed. Will you die\nif you don't show off?\" He's a retorted\nin rapid succession. The moment you\narrived, you accused three skilled\nplayers who hadn't shown any hostility\ntowards us of stealing resources. And\nthen you started picking fights with\nthem, didn't you see that even a hero\ncould see through it? Those bloodthirsty\nlords don't have red names unless they\nkill a certain number of people. How did\nyou, Dinglay, know they were bad guys?\nYou still want to morally blackmail boss\nLyn Sha? He's busy dealing with the\nofficial district lords, and he's also\ngoing around the world looking for bad\nguys to kill, which delays his progress.\nYour intentions are despicable. Their\nremarks also startled everyone. Some\npeople have also noticed something a\nmiss. That's right. How would Dinglay\nknow who did bad things? A few victims\nrevealed the killer's name before they\ndied, but most of the bad guys work in\nsecret, and nobody knows. Furthermore,\nthe reasons given for the conflict with\nJulie and the others are indeed\nfar-fetched. That's right. That's right.\nI've wanted to say this for a long time.\nbattlefield of all races, Ding Lay is\nthe one who broke the rules. While\nhealing his wounds within his territory,\nDing Lay, who was secretly using the\nchat channel, spat out another mouthful\nof blood. You I've been proven wrong\nagain. This time, I'm seriously injured.\nDinglay shakily closed the chat channel,\nbut the masked man's call came in again.\nI should have known better than to do a\nlive stream. It's embarrassing. Wong\nSu&lt;unk&gt;s tone was cold, and Ding Lay\nswayed again upon hearing this. You\ncan't even beat one of the heroes. You\nwere so impressive when you defeated\nJolie. That hero is too strong, Ding Lay\nroared. And I was careless. I didn't\ndodge. Dinglay thought to himself. He\nseems to know the weakness of my talent.\nThe masked man, Wong Su, snorted coldly.\nNo matter how strong he is, he's still\njust a hero. Didn't you say that Lynn\nShiao has no foundation and can't even\nafford a decent hero token? Listen, I\ndon't know what happened either. Dinglay\nsaid. Lyn Sha is too lowkey. All I know\nis that he has a beautiful female hero,\nwhich was mentioned in a system\nannouncement, etc. It's an epic chest,\nDinglay exclaimed. It must be from the\nreward epic chest that dropped an epic\nhero token. Lynhiao's tier 2 hero is an\nepic quality hero. That must be it, the\nmasked man said coldly. His Guster\nArcher was obtained from an epic\ntreasure chest. That's a demonic tide,\nDinglay said. After Lin Sha finished\nwriting the book, there was a powerful\ndemonic tide. It might be a rank. He\ndefended it with his own strength. The\nreward might even be an epic treasure\nchest. The masked man frowned. This kid\nhas way too many epic treasure chests.\nHis luck is just too good. He then shook\nhis head and muttered to himself. No\nmatter what, Lyn Xiao's trump card of\nhaving a powerful hero has been\nrevealed. Looks like I need to report\nthis and get the hero and troop\nconfigurations reinforced again. There\nare still a few days left. I hope the\nadults will agree. If I had known, I\nwould have personally broken through the\nserver and descended here. I'm a top 100\nexpert lord. Ding lay curled his lip\nthinking. Damn it. It really doesn't\nfeel good to be ridden around like that.\nChapter 93. Reactions from all sides.\nThe story of the filial son. That\nconcludes the entire account of this\nincident. He has more cards up his\nsleeve than I thought. After Chu Yusi\nfinished his report, there was a long\nsilence on the other end. Chu Yui and\nthe three from Julie have been exposed.\nBut what surprised me even more than\ntheir exposure was that the three of\nthem combined still couldn't defeat Ding\nLay. And Ding Lay couldn't even last a\nsingle move against one of Linhao&lt;unk&gt;s\nheroes. I can't help but ask, \"What\nexactly happened to your star pupil?\" A\ncold yet subtly authoritative voice came\nfrom behind, and Chu Yusi shrank back.\n\"Lord of the domain, it is my fault for\nnot raising them properly. They have\nbeen protected too much and have lost\nthe ability to deal with complex\nsituations. Then let them learn. It is\nthe domain lord. After a long while, a\nvoice came from the other end again. You\nrevealed your intention to protect and\nsupport Lynch. Given the nature of the\nCelestial People organization in order\nto humiliate us and weaken us, they will\nonly continue to increase their troops\nand upgrade their units and heroes. The\ndifficulty of the enemy Lynn Sha faces\nthis time will continue to increase.\nPrepare your son to be prepared and get\nhim involved if necessary. You must have\nsecretly given him quite a few nice\nthings. It is the domain lord. Chui\nwiped his sweat. My son is mediocre and\nhas always grown up under my protection.\nThis mission was dangerous, so I had no\nchoice but to give him two epic\nrecruitment tokens. I didn't mean to\npursue this matter, the cold voice said.\nIn this battleground of the myriad\nraces, who doesn't give their own\nchildren special treatment. Execute this\nmission well, and don't make any more\nmistakes. Lyn Sha has already proven his\npotential and mystique. It is the domain\nlord domain and whose appearance was\nlike that of a young girl yet who exuded\nthe dignified aura of someone who had\nlong held a high position leaned back on\nthe luxurious sofa resting her chin on\nher hand and talking to herself. A\ngenius unparalleled in Jangdong who only\nachieved anlevel talent in the Lord\ntalent test yet repeatedly created\nmiracles. First, he took first place in\na book, which triggered an S-level magic\ntide. Then, he led a mysterious troop to\nkill Ziao Daong and achieve great\nsuccess, ignoring the threat of the\ncelestial being Wong Su, which triggered\nthe breaking of the server., it has now\nbeen revealed that even one of his\nheroes possesses the combat power to\nsweep through the newbie zone. According\nto that hero, his strength is even\ngreater. There are really many things\nabout him that are hard to understand. I\nshould go and ask Khalil Jabbron again.\nGallen, no wonder you're so obsessed\nwith beating him. Kids like that are\nreally fun. At the same time, in an\nexceptionally luxurious Lord's Mansion\nin the official server of the Lan\nregion, a man in a floral shirt yawned\nand walked out with a charming young\nwoman in a kimono in each arm. Wong Su,\nwhat do you need me for? Seeing the\nimpatience on the man in the floral\nshirt, Wong Su felt a pang of jealousy.\nFirst an angel, now a special supply\nfrom Japan, indulging in pleasure day\nand night. It's too decadent. Could it\nbe that your superpower is related to\nthis? My lord, Wong Su, with his hooked\nnose, bowed respectfully. The matter is\nurgent, and I have no choice but to\nreport it in person. The man in the\nfloral shirt listened quietly to Wong\nSu&lt;unk&gt;s report, remaining silent for a\nlong time. After a long silence, the man\nslapped the two girls buttocks hard and\nchased them away. Then he slowly said,\n\"Lynn Shiao, is he really that\npowerful?\" His hero defeated Ding Lay in\na single move, and Ding Lay even\ndefeated three members of the Jolie\ntribe in succession. It is indeed my\nsubordinate suspicion that Ding Lay\nhimself also made a mistake. Regardless\nof the circumstances, it is an\nundeniable fact that this young man\npossesses a powerful hero. The man in\nthe floral shirt side. It was originally\njust a petty squabble over saving face.\nLyn Sha killed my underling's underling,\nruining my organization's reputation, so\nI killed him as a warning to others. But\nnow Lyn Sha is actually backed by Chu\nYusi, my old rival of many years. Domain\nlord of Lia domain. The man in the\nfloral shirts gaze grew increasingly\ncold. Our relationship with the Lia\ngovernment has always been one of mortal\nenmity. In Lang Shia, they hunt us down\non the battlefield of all races. We have\nthe support of the Eastern Kingdom so we\ncan go toe-to-toe with them. The fact\nthat Chu Yusi secretly sent three\nexperts to protect Lynn Shiao this time\nfully demonstrates Lin Xiao's\nimportance. Does your excellency mean to\nagree to upgrade some heroes and troop\ntypes? Wong Su&lt;unk&gt;s face lit up with\njoy. He, the man in the floral shirt,\nlaughed. Upgrade all units and heroes to\nthe highest level, except for a team of\nlegendary gold units. Everyone else is\nepic. Equip black flame with my epic\nweapon, too. Wong Su was taken aback.\nSir, aren't you placing far too much\nimportance on that kid? You're wrong. I\nwouldn't give you these troops just for\nthe sake of saving face. But now it's\nall about striking at that woman, Lord\nLia, killing Lin Shiao, killing Ju Lee\nand the others, and giving that pretty\nwoman a good beating in the face. The\nman in the floral shirt squinted his\neyes, looking completely captivated and\nsaid, \"Ah, I can't wait any longer. I'm\ngoing to slap her hard. Slap her hard.\"\nSeeing the man in the floral shirts\nexpression, Wong Su awkwardly shifted\nhis gaze. The man in the floral shirt\nthen added. Also, besides Ding Lay bribe\nmore lords in the newbie zones,\nDinglay&lt;unk&gt;s performance is very\ninconsistent, and I don't really trust\nhim. Yes, sir. At night, Lin Sha, who\nhad already returned to his territory,\nfirst waved his hand. Upgrade. Pay Min\nwho had been waiting in the territory\nsmiled and gave Lin Sha a bow with his\nhands clasped. This junior thanks the\nLord. Well done, Pay Min. Lyn Sha\npraised Pay Min a few times, then\nreached out and took the Frost Sorrow to\nexamine it closely. My lord, what sword\nis this? Why does it exude a chilling\naura? Ba asked curiously from the side.\nThis sword is called Frostorn, Lynsha. I\nnever thought I would actually see the\nreal Frostmore. Seeing that Baoi was\nstill full of curiosity like a kitten,\nLyn Sha took advantage of the time when\neveryone was sitting and eating spirit\nrice porridge and spirit fish to\nintroduce them to everyone. He briefly\nrecounted the story of a game he had\nplayed in his previous life. And just\nlike that, this idiot killed his own\nking father. You know what? This western\ntradition of patraside has actually\npersisted. In the end, this powerful\nweapon also got a nickname. What\nnickname? Soldering asked filop piety\nsword. Upon hearing this, everyone\nlowered their heads, trying hard to\nsuppress their laughter. The idiot also\ngot another nickname. What nickname? Ba\nplayed the role of a perfect straight\nman. A very filial son. Several soldiers\nand heroes couldn't help but chuckle\nwhile many others trembled with\nexcitement. Finally, Jana, the idiot's\nformer lover, also got a nickname. Lyn\nSha looked around and seeing the\nsurprised look mixed with everyone's\nfocused expressions, said with\nsatisfaction, \"Her new nickname is a\ngreat filial daughter.\" \"Gleg,\" Ba\ncouldn't hold back any longer and\ncovered her mouth, laughing non-stop.\nHearing the system notification that he\nhad gained 100,000 gold coins at once,\nLyn Shiao was in a great mood. Just as\nthe time was up, Lynn Shiao waved his\nhand. Upgrade the Lord's mansion to\nlevel three. Chapter 94. The Lord\ncomposes a poem and Shin Leong Yu\nfollows him to the death. Now, Lin Shiao\nhas begun upgrading the three lord's\nmansions. When upgrading to the second\ntier, he heeded the advice of the\nancient demon and didn't try to be\nnumber one. But you absolutely must be\nfirst to upgrade to tier three because\nit adds one hero slot. His resource\nextraction speed is five times that of\nothers. So what is an enormous amount of\ntier three resources for others? Lynn\nShiao has already accumulated by\nclearing the house of death and\noccupying the upgrade mines. His\ncooldown period for his second tier base\nwas just right. So he immediately\nconfirmed the upgrade. With the addition\nof his talent, 100% increase in leveling\nspeed. He only needs 48 hours. And by\ntomorrow night, the three lords mansions\nthat originally took 96 hours to upgrade\nwill be completed. Then I recruited\nthree heroes and was able to build a\nstable immediately to try recruiting and\ntraining cavalry. Everything will wait\nuntil tomorrow. After pressing the three\nupgrade buttons, Paymen's exclusive\nbuilding, Wandering Knight Pavilion, and\nShin Leongu's exclusive building, Tusi\nvillage, were also completed. Great. Now\nwe can go recruit hero specific units.\nLin Shiao excitedly led Pay Min Baoi and\nChin Leong Yu to their private building.\nPay Min, this is your exclusive\nbuilding, the wanderer's pavilion. Lyn\nShiao said, \"Zhiao guest wears a silk\ntassel. Wuhuk sword shines like frost\nand snow. Silver saddle shines on white\nhorse, swift as a shooting star. Go.\nFrom now on, you can live here and\ntogether with your chivalous companions,\nfight against evil and right wrongs. Pay\nMin's eyes shown with emotion as he\nbowed deeply to Lyn Sha, saying, \"Pay\nMin thanks you, Lord.\" When Baoi saw Lin\nSha casually recite an ancient Chinese\npoem, she looked at her lord with her\nbeautiful eyes, sending him flirtatious\nglances. Lyn Sha checked the attributes\nof wandering swordsman pavilion. Yosha\nPavilion quality gold legendary the\nexclusive building of a legendary hero\nis directly legendary level one defense\n50,000 recruitable unit tier gold\nlegendary recruitable units white horse\nranger 5,000 units of food 5,000 units\nof gold 1,000 units of refined iron\n1,000 units of refined copper 10 units\nof crystal 10 units of gem 10 units of\nsulfur 10 units of mercury. Recruitment\nspeed 48 24 hours/person\nnote a stable is required. Lin sha was\nstunned and pay min was also stunned.\nThe wandering knights pavilion need\nstables. Wandering knights need horses.\nLynsha said in astonishment and this\nwhite horse wandering knight is too\nexpensive. No wonder the wandering\nknights in the novels spend money like\nwater. So this money comes from here.\nYou don't have a horse yet, Pay Min\nmumbled. Unable to recruit any wandering\nknights. Lynn Sha had no choice but to\ngive up. We&lt;unk&gt;ll have to wait until we\nhave three books before we can recruit\nthe White Horse Ranger. Lyn Sha\ncomforted Pay Min. Don't be discouraged.\nWe'll go to Zuikinlu for a couple of\ndrinks later. I'll be your chivalous\nfriend. Drunken Immortal Pavilion is a\nbuilding that Lin Sha upgraded yesterday\nusing the Huasha token ascension skill.\nIts predecessor was the tavern. Today,\nthe drunken immortal pavilion has risen\nfrom the ground, standing five stories\nhigh and covering an area of nearly\n10,000 square meters. The soldiers no\nlonger have to sit on the ground in\nfront of the Lord's mansion to eat.\nBecause of the quality of the golden\nlegend, dining at Drunken Immortal\nPavilion can accelerate the recovery of\nspiritual energy, magic, injuries, and\nstamina, and can also automatically\nproduce dozens of craft beers, ranging\nfrom excellent to epic. Lyn Sha arranged\nfor several Golden Legend farmers to\nserve as cooks, and also arranged for 10\nflower fairies to enter the drunken\nimmortal pavilion as waitresses.\nGraceful flower fairies flitted among\nthe crowd, serving wine and dishes,\ncreating a delightful scene. My lord,\nyou are still my master. Please don't\nflatter me. Pay men dared not agree to\ndrink and call Lin Shia his brother and\nquickly declined, but I couldn't\nsuppress the joy and emotion in my\nheart. The group arrived at another hero\nexclusive building, the Tusi village.\nLyang Yu, do you know the Chongjan\nEmperor of the Ming Dynasty? Chin Leong\nYu shook her head. When Lyang Yu was in\nanother world, the emperor was the Wanly\nEmperor. It seems that Chin Liang\nYu&lt;unk&gt;s memories are from her youth.\nLyn Sha nodded. Then I'll give you a\npoem. Lin Shaing said, \"Learn the eight\ntrigrams formation of Western Sichuan.\nHe held the military tally hidden in his\nMandarin duck sleeves. Women have always\nbeen willing to accept this. Why must a\ngeneral be considered a man? Let's carve\nthis poem on the entrance of the Tusi\nvillage. Holding the military tally in\nthe sleeves of a Mandarin duck, why must\na general be a husband? Sheen Leon Yu\nslowly repeated. And this bright and\nbeautiful woman who was so heroic and\ndecisive had tears welling up in her\neyes at some point. Does the Lord know\nall the grievances in my heart? My\nunwillingness to stand out from the\ncrowd and my obsession with not being\nweaker than men. She raised her hand and\ngently wiped her face, then immediately\nknelt on one knee before Lin Sha. I am\ndeeply grateful for your kindness, Lord.\nI, Lean Yu, swear to follow you to the\ndeath. Ding. Your hero, Chin Lean\nYu&lt;unk&gt;s loyalty has reached 100%.\nShe'll follow you to the death. Lyn\nShiao quickly helped Shin Leong Yu up,\nhis shock no less than hers. He had only\ngotten a poem by Emperor Chong for free.\nAnd this girl had already reached 100\nloyalty points. 90 points means you can\ndo whatever you want. 100 points means\nyou'll be with me through thick and\nthin. This married woman is much easier\nto seduce than Ba. Lyn Sha shook his\nhead violently. What was he thinking? It\nmust be a side effect of being possessed\nby Emperor Wu of Wei. There&lt;unk&gt;'s no\nneed for such formalities. Lean Yu, I\ntold you you can consider this place\nyour home. Chin Leong Yu looked up at\nthe familiar Tusci village and nodded\nemphatically. Yes. Check the attributes\nof the Tusci village. Tusci village\nquality golden legend. Level one defense\n50,000. Recruitable unit level, gold\nlegendary. Recruitable units.\nWhite-shaped spearman, 1,000 units of\nfood, 1,000 gold coins, 1,000 fine wood,\n10 sulfur. Recruitment speed, 6 3\nThe conditions and speed of recruiting\nWhite Spear soldiers are indeed much\nmore normal. Recruit White Spear\nsoldiers immediately. Then, Lynn Sha\nsummoned all the soldiers to the square.\nAfter 2 days of intensive recruitment,\nplus the original soldiers, he now has\n18 MO Dao iron guards, 18 divine arm\narchers, and 20 white pole spear\nsoldiers. There are 42 Phantom archers,\nand we can recruit seven more tomorrow.\nSeven per week. There are eight\ncyclopes, and we can recruit three more\nnext week. Three per week. The Cyclops\ndidn't come. Lynn Shiao had them\nstationed in the cave at the top of the\nCalabash Mountains, but they could still\nsee their attributes. In addition, there\nare there are over 50 golden legendary\nfarmers, 10 excellent farmers, 40 rare\nfarmers, and 30 common farmers. There\nare 130 flower fairies. Besides, after\nseveral days of fighting and grinding\nmonsters, I have eight recruitment\ntokens of various levels in hand for any\neventuality. Progress is correct. In 4\ndays, the Black Flame Lord will break\nthrough the region and descend at my own\npace. I can just gather 50 each of the\nMO Dao iron guards, divine arm archers,\nand white spear soldiers, and I'll be\nable to get into a third tier university\nin 2 days. After completing the third\nset, I will have two more heroes. There\nare even two days to prepare. There will\nprobably be even more surprises for\nBlack Flame. Man, the enemy is all level\n30, so my men can't be any lower level\neither. Without saying a word, Lin Shia\nglanced at all his resources and\nimmediately started upgrading all his\ntroops and heroes. Chin Leong Yu has\nleveled up to level 15. Upgrade all Mod\nDao iron guards to level 15. Upgrade all\narchers to level 15. Upgrade all\nwhite-shaped spearmen to level 15.\nUpgrade all phantom shooters to level\n20. Okay. Ba. Upgrade BI to level two\nfirst. Chapter 95. Tang Ya's obsession.\nBa se's little trick. Pay Min is already\nlevel 15. The Cyclops is level 20 and\nLyn Sha hasn't leveled up yet. A flash\nof light swept through and all the\nsoldiers were bathed in it. Feeling an\nindescribable sense of comfort. Lyn Sha\nstared nervously at Baoi, slowly\nobserving her, but saw nothing unusual\nabout her. He then clicked to check Ba's\nattributes. It's still the same as\nbefore. Attributes that should be\nreplaced with are still replaced with\nonly the soul stat has been increased to\n105. Does leveling up grant plus six to\nattributes or is it the most difficult\nattribute to improve soul? Lyn Sha\nthought to himself that Bao was indeed\nnot simple. Just as he was about to ask\nBa if she wanted to level up again, he\nsaw her gently shake her head. The\nimplication was as if to say, \"I am\nutterly powerless, my lord. Please use\nyour experience where it is needed.\"\nLynn Shiao chuckled softly, realizing\nthat he seemed to have a great\nunderstanding with Baoi. Seeing that all\nthe troop types had completed their\nupgrades and feeling his own increased\npower, Lynn Shiao declared loudly,\n\"Gentlemen, we have captured the entire\nHolition Ridge. Starting tomorrow, we'll\nbe going to deal with all the monsters\nin the entire Calabash Valley. Before\nthe Black Flames descend, we will occupy\nthe entire Calabash mountain range,\ngather our strength to fight the enemy,\nand make all those who dare to invade us\nsuffer a crushing defeat. We swear to\nserve our lord to the death. The\nsoldiers shouted. Lyn Sha nodded,\ntelling everyone to go and rest while he\nhimself took charge of inspecting the\nterritory. He arrived at the war hall.\nThis is where future discussions about\nthe military region will take place. He\ncan observe the sand table here with his\nheroes and unit leaders to formulate\ncombat strategies. Of course, the war\nhall will also issue some missions\ntriggering upgrades to military\nequipment, etc. Lynn Sha waved his hand.\nUse the Hashia order ascension function\nto ascend the Warh Hall. The Warh Hall\nhas been upgraded to the highest level.\nWarh Hall quality golden legend. Level\none. Defense 50,000. Researchable\nprojects. None at present. Awaiting\nactivation. Current mission. Your Mod\nDao iron guard is brave and invincible.\nIronblooded and fierce. Wielding the MO\nDAO, you can defeat any flesh and blood\nenemy in the world. However, their armor\nis a combination of scale armor and\nchain mail. So, there is still room for\nimprovement in terms of protective\ncapabilities. The MO DAO Iron Guard has\nlong coveted the 60 lb infantryman's\narmor, the Divine Armcher. Please grant\nhis wish and let the Mod Dao iron guard\nunleash even greater power. Task one.\nUse the Mod Dao iron guard to kill\nlegendary or higher level lords troops\nknown for their defense. Reward, you can\nresearch and upgrade all Mod Dao iron\nguards to bright armor. Mission two, use\nthe divine arm archer to kill more than\n10 times the number of epic level or\nhigher lords troops in melee combat.\nReward, you can research all the MO Dao\niron guards upgraded infantry armor. Lin\nShiao was delighted after reading the\nposted task. It seems Tang Yi has been\nunable to forget Song Rule and his group\ns infantrymen. That's right. Skill lies\nin being a brave warrior charging into\nbattle. The armor of the Mod Dao\nsoldiers was slightly inferior to that\nof the divine arm bow, a ranged weapon\nthat claimed to be weak. Tanggi was\nnaturally resentful. Lyn Shao smiled and\nshook his head. This task requires\ndealing with the Lord's troops. Simply\ngrinding monsters won't work, which adds\na bit of difficulty. Never mind. I'll\njust focus on completing the task and\nfulfilling Tang Ya&lt;unk&gt;s wish. Besides\nthe warh hall, Lin Sha also used the\nascension function to upgrade the\nblacksmith shop the day before\nyesterday, but he hasn't had time to\ncheck it yet. Ascension has a 24-hour\ncool down period, which Lin Shia\ngenerally doesn't waste, and he ascends\none building every day. Blacksmith shop\nquality golden legend level one required\nblacksmith farmer function produce any\nweapons and equipment of legendary\nquality or lower requires additional\nresources and a master blacksmith repair\nand maintain farm tools, weapons and\narmor.

Infantry armor, barbarian iron\narmor, wargeears, none. I haven't met a\nmaster blacksmith yet, and I don't have\na blacksmith's talisman. I'm still\nmissing out on blacksmithing skills.\nAlthough it is still impossible to\nproduce weapons or armor for the time\nbeing. However, the upgrade project is\nunique to the golden legend blacksmith\nshop. The blacksmith can upgrade\nwhatever weapons your lord's troops\nhave. This is a very good feature. As\nlong as you have enough resources and\ntime, you can further improve the combat\nstrength of your troops. But the\nresources we have now are still not\nenough. Lyn Sha closed the blacksmith\nshop panel. Let's save it for upgrading\nto level three and building stables. We\nshould use the money wisely. When\nplaying Starcraft, is it more important\nto save resources to build a battle\ncruiser or to upgrade the attack of 10\ntanks at home by one level? After\ninspecting the territory, Lynn Shiao\nsummoned several farmers and instructed\nthem to build something at daybreak the\nnext day, pointing out the location to\nthem. After finishing all this, Lyn Sha\nheaded home to rest. The thoughtful Baoi\nhad already prepared the bathwater and\nwas waiting for her lord. For many days,\nBaoi had been serving Lin Shao everyday,\nhelping him bathe and go to bed. My\nlord, I was impressed by your quick wit\nand eloquent speech today. You recited\ntwo ancient poems, and your talent was\ntruly unparalleled. As Baoi massaged Lin\nXiao's shoulders while he soaked in the\nlarge bathtub, she said enviously, \"Baoi\nalso liked ancient poems. But in the\nChinese history that the ancient demons\ninstilled in Baoi, there were only a few\npoems. Baoi pressed her face against Lin\nXiao, her breath sweet as orchids. If\nyour lordship has the time, could you\nperhaps write a classical poem for Baoi\nas well? A hint of surprise flashed\nthrough Linhao&lt;unk&gt;s mind. Ba of the\nZhao dynasty actually liked ancient\npoetry. I also need to write a poem for\nher myself. The enchantress is really\nproactive. She should just ask the Lord\nwhat she wants. Does she want her own\nbody? After a pause, Lyn Sha was\nsurprised that this online novel plot of\ncomposing poems to woo girls could\nhappen to him. Even though Baoi was\nalready his catch. Upon seeing Bao's\nstunningly beautiful face and expectant\ngaze, her eyes as innocent as a fawns,\nLin Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s heart stirred. Ba, I have\na poem here that suits you perfectly. Of\ncourse, it's the poem that every person\nwho travels back to ancient times has to\nmemorize to pick up girls. When the\nclouds resemble her clothes and the\nflowers resemble her face, which woman\nwouldn't be captivated? Just as Lin Sha\nwas about to speak, he noticed a hint of\ncunning in Ba's expectant gaze. Do you\nknow what kind of poem I want to write?\nLyn Sha blurted out. Oh, this concubine\ndid not know that your highness wished\nto write the chimping tune for this\nconcubine. Ba realized she had spoken\nout of turn and covered her mouth. Hei,\n\"How come you know about Chimping Tune?\"\nLyn Shao, having exposed Ba's scheme,\nwas not annoyed, but instead asked with\na smile. The ancient demon senior\nemphasized the four great demones and\nfour great beauties of China and also\ninstilled in me this poem describing the\nbeauty of Sister Yang. Guay Bi blushed\nand said, \"I was just thinking that the\nLord should read it aloud as well so\nthat I could also experience what it\nfeels like to be pampered.\" As soon as\nshe spoke, Ba's eyes reened and tears\nwelled up in her innocent eyes, making\nher look pitiful. Seeing Bao's shy yet\npitiful appearance, Lynn Shaighed\nsoftly, \"Come, I'll write a poem for you\nmyself.\" After saying that, Lynn Shao\nreached out and pulled the panicked Baoi\ninto the bathtub. Chapter 96. A poem\npresented to a beautiful woman. Warm bed\nchamber. Chingping Dao was written by\nLee Bi at the behest of Emperor\nSchwanzong of Tang about Yongu Fei. The\nclouds resemble her clothes, the flowers\nher face, the spring breeze caresses the\nballastrade, the dew is heavy. If not\nseen at top Mount Shuanu, then met\nbeneath the moon on the jade terrace.\nBack then, because of this poem, the\nbeauty of the imperial concubine was\nsung throughout the land, and her\nelegance and nobility were loved and\nrespected by all. The love that Emperor\nSchwanzong of Tang had for Yangu Fei is\npraised by the world. But the story of\ntheir separation by death is another\nmatter. Despite being labeled a fim\nfatal, Baoi was forever burdened with\ninfamy. Baosi's heart simply longed for\nthe person she loved to recite this poem\nto her. Let her experience what it feels\nlike to be pampered. For some reason,\nthe straightforward Lin Shiao suddenly\nhad a flash of inspiration and\nimmediately understood Ba's thoughts. He\npulled Baoi into the bathtub, gently\npressing her shoulders to stop her\nstruggles and said, \"Don't worry, I'll\nwrite it for you right away.\" Ba quieted\ndown, her long jet black hair half\nfloating in the water. Her face, a blend\nof allure and innocence, was\nirresistibly charming under the steam.\nThe curve of her collarbone was soft and\ncrystallin. She sat obediently and\nquietly opposite Lyn Sha. Lyn Sha leaned\nagainst one end of the bathtub, looking\ninto Bao's nervous yet expectant eyes\nand slowly recited. A painted carriage\nand a carved saddle meet on a narrow\nroad. A heart-wrenching sound from\nbehind the embroidered curtain. Ba's\nsmall mouth immediately opened slightly\nand surprise was written on her pretty\nface. Lord, you're saying that your\nchance encounter with him was a destiny\nordained by heaven. The battlefield of\nmyriad races is so vast, and the chances\nof people from two different worlds\nmeeting have been so small over\nthousands of years, but I've run into\nthe Lord. Isn't this a classic case of\nmeeting on a narrow path? Is that\nheart-wrenching cry a sign that the Lord\nis worried about her voice? Ba's heart\npounded. Lynn Sha closed his eyes,\ntilted his head back slightly, and\ncontinued, \"My body lacks the wings of a\ncolorful phoenix to fly with me. Those\nwho are of one mind understand each\nother perfectly.\" Bowsi instinctively\ncovered her mouth. Isn't this just\ntalking about how the Lord saw through\nhis attempt to get the Lord to recite\nthe chimping tune? The two people didn't\nspeak, but they both understood each\nother's meaning. Lord. She actually said\nthat she and he were of one mind and\nunderstood each other perfectly. A\nmeeting of minds. What a beautiful\nphrase. What a fitting metaphor. Ba's\nbreathing became rapid. In the large\nbathtub, Lynn Sha, eyes closed and\nnaked, leaned against her. The rising\nsteam made his handsome, sunny face even\nmore captivating. Her perfectly\nproportioned face, slightly flushed from\nthe hot water, combined with her long\nneck and muscular chest, exuded a\ncaptivating aura. Ba's gaze\ninvoluntarily widened. This poem, such a\nmasterpiece, was written for himself. Ba\nfelt that her life had been worthwhile.\nA house of gold, a cage of jade. Lyn\nSha, still with his eyes closed,\ncontinued. Cars flowed like water.\nHorses galloped like dragons. There's\nmore to the story. The poem isn't\nfinished yet. A house of gold, a cage of\njade. Does this refer to her life of\nluxury and extravagance as a concubine\nof the Zhao Emperor? Ba thought to\nherself. Cars flowed like water and\nhorses galloped like dragons. It means\nthat his life back then was prosperous\nand luxurious. But does that mean she's\nsurrounded by a constant stream of men?\nAlthough I have never had physical\nintimacy with any man, my lord still\ncares, doesn't he? With men coming and\ngoing like a flowing stream, all having\ndesigns on her, who would still believe\nshe is still pure and innocent. As\nexpected, I am still not worthy of the\nLord. Ba's tears flowed out in a flash.\nHer tears fell like pearls from a broken\nstring, pattering down her face. My\nlord, this humble servant. Just as Baoi\nwas about to choke out a sob, Lyn Sha\nreached out and gently cuped her face,\ntenderly wiping away her tears. Don't\nrush. It's&lt;unk&gt; not over yet. Lyn Sha\nslowly opened his eyes, his clear and\ngentle gaze meeting Bao's moist eyes. He\nsoftly murmured. Lin Lang already\nlaments the distance to Pongai Mountain.\nAnd beyond that, countless mountains\nseparate us. Ba was stunned for a few\nseconds. Then suddenly realizing what\nwas happening, tears streamed down my\nface again. My lord. Ba threw herself\ninto Linhao&lt;unk&gt;s arms without\nhesitation. My lord, my lord. Ba,\nnestled in Lyn Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s arms was\nspeechless, only repeating this one\nsentence over and over again. The last\ntwo lines of Lin Xiao's poem are saying\nexactly what Lin Shiao wanted to pursue\nher just like he wanted to go to the\ndistant Punglai Mountain to seek\nimmortality and enlightenment. That\nplace was so far away and difficult to\nreach. The distance between them was\neven greater than that of the distant\nPunglai Mountain tens of thousands of\nmiles away. Lynn Shiao as a lord is as\nsacred and majestic as an emperor or\nmonarch on the battlefield of all races\nand is inviable. Baoi was merely a\nvixen, an ominous figure who brought\ndisaster to countless people. Lord Lynn\nSha not only didn't care about her past,\nbut also lowered himself to say that\npursuing her was as difficult as\npursuing a distant immortal mountain\ntens of thousands of times more\ndifficult. What a sincere feeling this\nis. Lin Lang already laments the\ndistance to Pongai Mountain, now\nseparated by tens of thousands of Pongai\nMountains. Is my position in the Lord's\nheart really that high? I had just\nthought the Lord looked down on me. Ba's\nemotions at this moment were beyond\nwords. All the grievances, sadness, and\nself-deprecation I felt just now have\ntransformed into an even more\noverwhelming surge of love. Ba wrapped\nher arms around Lin Xiao's neck and\nkissed him directly. Ding! Your hero\nBao's loyalty has reached 100%. She'll\nfollow you to the death. Ding! Due to\ntriggering a major emotional fluctuation\nin Baoi, breaking the shackles that had\nbound her heart for many years, Bao's\nluck value has increased to zero. In the\npast, the system notification would have\nelicited a few complaints from Lin Shia,\nsuch as, \"This poem is more effective\nthan dozens of jokes. Why aren't my gold\ncoins increasing?\" There were also\ncomments like, \"This girl is obviously\nnot cultured enough and is easy to fool.\nIf she memorizes one more poem, she\nwon't be able to recognize you.\" And so\non. But at this moment, Lyn Sha had long\nforgotten about the system notification\nsound. His eyes were only on the\nbeautiful woman in front of him. After a\nlong and passionate kiss, the two\nparted. Ba blushed and only dared to\nbury her head in Lyn Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s arms.\nShe released Lin Xiao's neck and was\nabout to move away from him to apologize\nfor her rude behavior when I\naccidentally bumped into something in\nthe bathtub again. Wow, how magnificent.\nBa blushed even more, her head almost\nburying itself in the steaming hot\nwater. You think you can just run away\nafter you've teased me? Lyn Sha pulled\nBaoi back again, causing a large splash\nof water. After a long while, the two\nparted. Lin Xiao was about to do\nsomething else when he heard Baoi\nwhisper, \"My lord, I have been gone for\n2 days.\" Lynho&lt;unk&gt;s breathing suddenly\nstopped, then became rapid. He scooped\nBaoi up in his arms and carried her\ndirectly to the bed. Ba! Lord Lin Lang,\nthe spring night is warm under the tent,\nand her hair is swaying like lotus\nblossoms. Click to view hidden content.\nAt this moment, the two were\ninseparable. Chapter 97. the invaders in\nthe peaceful valley. In the valley of\nCalabash, the fog of war drifted and\nlingered, a vast expanse of white mist.\nThis place is filled with bird song and\nfragrant flowers. And everywhere you\nlook is pristine natural scenery. Here\nyou'll find tall trees, rugged boulders,\nwinding paths, and flowing streams. In\nthe center of the valley, there is a\nvast, lush green grassland. This place\nis home to a wide variety of species\nwhich is truly breathtaking. Green\ngoblins who love and cherish human women\nand often appear in various harmonious\nnovels and comics. There are strong and\nsturdy centaur raiders who also\nfrequently appear in hentai comics\nserving as the leaders of a certain\nsection. There are pacifists orc\nsmashers who only occasionally kill\nhumans who invade their homes to protect\ntheir layers. They love to eat eggs.\nThere are also bandits and thugs who\nlive in harmony with nature and roam the\nforest year round. They are quite rare\nas human monsters. There are also\nbloodthirsty witches with eerie and\nbeautiful appearances who enjoy\nrelieving men's worries and often\nforcibly relax the muscles of young men.\nIn short, this place is home to a wide\nvariety of creatures and species, boasts\nabundant resources, and has a beautiful\nenvironment. It is truly a paradise on\nearth and a haven for wild animals. Of\nthe myriad races lived happily in this\ngourd valley, enjoying a life of mutual\nfighting and constant turmoil. Until\nthis day, the iron hoves of the\nshameless invaders shattered the already\nchaotic lives of all the monsters. More\nthan 100 invaders armed with weapons\nstepped into this beautiful and fertile\nland. Then in order to defend their\nhomeland, the monsters launched a brave\nand resolute counterattack against the\ninvaders. The cowardly goblins did not\nlose their courage this time. They were\nthe first to rush forward like a green\ntide. Then they were pinned down one by\none by a dense and swift barrage of\narrows without even reaching the\ninvaders. It must be condemned that the\narcher was none other than our former\nneighbor, the phantom archer who lived\non the ridge. This time, however, the\nphantom shooters put on white overalls\nand became ruthless. They forgot their\nformer neighbors. The last goblin was\nalso shot down. He let out a whale and\nno one could understand the goblin\nlanguage. Only that the sound seemed to\nbe. Little Blackie has made some brazed\nchicken feet. Do you want some? And some\nfried dough sticks. Do you want some?\nThen came the tragic centaur raiders who\nencountered a group of fierce looking\nbrutes who slashed at the centur's\nheads. The centur's proud length was\nthus cut off. Every strike is a critical\nhit. The Orc's shredders suddenly rushed\nout from behind and ambushed the group\nof archers at the very back. The giant\naxe swung up from bottom to top, all for\nthis long- awaited moment. Clang. The\narchers slowly turned around, staring\ncoldly at the bewildered orcs. The giant\nax cleaved through their layers of\narmored plates without causing any\ndamage. These archers raised their fists\nas large as sandbags and covered in\narmor plates and slammed them down at\nthe orcs. Bare-handed, he smashed the\norc as head. Hundreds and thousands of\nbandits and thugs also rushed out,\nintending to engulf the invaders. But\nfrom behind the bandits and thugs, a\nsmall group of soldiers wielding white\nspears rushed out and stabbed anyone\nthey saw, killing the bandits and thugs\nwho were running around in all\ndirections, clutching their buttocks.\nMassacre. It was an absolute one-sided\nmassacre. At this moment, several people\nstepped out from the invading group. The\nleader was a handsome young man. His\nlips were just right. He stood with his\nhands behind his back, calmly observing\neverything. Beside him were a man and a\nwoman, one on his left and one on his\nright. The man was dressed in white and\nwas only slightly less handsome than\nhim, also dashing and unrestrained. The\nwoman wore silver soft armor and a\nbright red cloak, looking heroic and\nincomparably beautiful. What a\ngood-looking team of intruders. I'm here\ntoday to do only three things. The\nleading man held up three fingers and\nsaid loudly, \"Kill the ugly ones. Leave\nthe beautiful ones. Kill all the men.\nLeave the women alive. Kill all who\nresist. Leave those who surrender.\"\nAfter thinking for a moment, the man\nadded, \"Goblins surrendering doesn't\ncount. Kill them all. These disgusting\ncreatures are an eyesore. During the new\nyear, I never want to see goblins in my\nnotebook again. I'd rather they all be\nwiped out. The man behind him tilted his\nhead. My lord, what is a dincshi?\nIt's&lt;unk&gt; irrelevant. The leader of the\ninvaders waved his hand. The shameless\ninvaders began their massacre. The\npeaceful and tranquil valley was\nshattered by screams. The kind-hearted,\nrelatively kind, indigenous people of\nthe valley were subjected to a one-sided\nmassacre and could only flee while\ncrying out. No monster could withstand a\nsingle blow from the invaders. Even the\ndemon natives, who were the absolute\nbackbone of the demon race, such as the\npowerful tyrant demon and the ferocious\nthree-headed hellhound were mercilessly\nkilled. When all the surviving native\nmonsters were chased into a corner by\nthe invaders with nowhere to escape, the\nleading man strolled over leisurely, his\nhands behind his back. Behind him stood\ntwo heroes, a man and a woman. The man's\nsword was stained with blood, and the\nwoman's spear gleamed coldly. The\nbloodthirsty witch leader was so\nfrightened that she knelt down. \"Spare\nus! Spare us! Please let us go!\nWe&lt;unk&gt;ll do anything!\" After saying\nthis, the witch crawled up to the male\nintruder who was leading the group,\ngrabbed his leg, and pressed her\nbeautiful, bewitching face against his\nfoot. The bloodthirsty witch twisted and\nturned, her voice seductive and\nalluring. \"My lord, spare our lives. Let\nus go and we&lt;unk&gt;ll do anything you ask.\nAfter saying that, she stuck out her\nblood red tongue and licked the leader's\nboot, her alluring eyes gazing at him\nseductively. All the indigenous people\nin the valley were filled with grief and\nindignation upon seeing this scene. Its\nown valley s most beautiful member is\nbegging for food from the intruders just\nto survive. The silver armored woman\nbehind the intruder's leader instantly\nflared up, her pretty face turning\nfrosty, her silver spear pointing\ndirectly at the bloodthirsty witch.\nSlaughter them all now. The bloodthirsty\nwitch turned deathly pale with fright.\nNo, don't kill me. I really can do\neverything. My sister is good, too. She\nlearned from succubi and is very good at\nattracting them. Shut up. What foul\nlanguage. The woman in silver armor was\nfurious and was about to stab him with\nher spear. Don't be impatient. The\nleader of the invaders calmly stopped\nthe silver armored woman, muttering to\nhimself. She didn't say what she was\nsmoking. Why are you getting so worked\nup? Then with a warm smile on his face,\nhe blew towards the blood which like a\nspring breeze in a valley. Are you\nreally willing to do anything? Really? A\nseductive light began to appear in the\nblood witch's eyes. All right, let's see\nhow sincere you are. The blood witch's\nhands had already reached up from the\nman's thighs. The slaughtered valley\nmonster closed its eyes in despair. It's\nas if some kind of minotaur drama is\nabout to begin. The intruder kicked the\nbloodthirsty witch away and shouted,\n\"All the monsters who want to surrender,\nI'm giving you a chance now. Go deep\ninto Calabash Valley and have a good\ntalk with all the wild monsters that\nlive there.\" Chapter 98. resource\nsolution. Calabash Valley completely\nconquered. I will conquer the entire\nvalley. Whether it's the monster\ngathering points or their layers,\nwhether you are evil creatures,\nbenevolent creatures, or neutral\ncreatures, the intruder proclaimed, \"If\nyou want to survive, surrender\nobediently. Accept my reorganization. I\nguarantee that all surrendering monsters\nwill live a life of luxury.\" A tall,\nburly minur asked timidly, \"Should we\nstill kill the man? Those who surrender\nto me will not be killed.\" The minur\nbreathed a sigh of relief and said in a\nlow voice, \"Ah, then I don't need to\npretend to be a girl anymore.\" Hearing\nthe powerful, muscular minur's\nclapper-like voice. The invader leader\nwas taken aback, then waved his hand,\nand more than a dozen arrows pierced\nthrough the minur. Whether they're human\ndemons or bull demons, they must be\nkilled. Having resolved the farce, the\ninvading leader said calmly,\n\"Four-fifths of the resources produced\nwill be mine, and 1/5if will go back to\nthe original owner.\" \"After I conquer\nyour stronghold, if I need to conscript\nsoldiers, I will pay you the normal\nfees. It's only right to risk your life\nfor money. You've suffered no losses,\nand you no longer need to worry about me\nkilling you all. then you will be\nbrought under my control and you will\nnot be allowed to wage war against each\nother unless there are special\ncircumstances. Your safety will also be\nguaranteed. From now on, you and I will\nbe the masters of this valley together.\nWouldn't that be wonderful? The blood\nwitch kicked to the ground and the other\nmonsters looked at each other in\nbewilderment. Then she spoke cautiously.\nMy lord, after you seize the mine, our\nresources are only 1/if of what they\nwere before. How can there be no loss?\nThe male leader of the invaders did not\nblame them, but nodded gently. Very\ngood. If you have any questions, you\nshould raise them. We are messengers of\npeace, not vicious demons. Everyone\nagrees, right? The monsters looked at\nthe minotaur lying on the ground. Then\nlooking at the intruder's 3meter long,\ngleaming, long-handled giant swords, the\n2- m tall giant dressed like he was\nwearing a metal can and smashing an\norc's head with his bare hands. Looking\nat the dark-kinned man with the 4 m long\nwhite spear, looking at the phantom\nshooter wearing overalls. You say it's\nnot brutal? Okay, the last one wasn't\nreally brutal. It was even a bit funny.\nBut the monsters still dared not utter a\nsound. The male leader of the invaders\nthen looked at the blood witch, \"What\nmineral veain have you captured?\" The\nbloodthirsty witch said gracefully, \"My\nsisters and I have occupied two mines.\nOne is a fine iron or mine, and the\nother is a mercury mine. What do you\nmean by slave? Where did you learn that\nfrom?\" Bloody witch. Huh? Isn't that\nwhat all demonistes say after they've\nbeen subdued? The leader of the\nintruders shook his head helplessly and\nsaid, \"Then try your vein. Give me the\nore, the bloodthirsty which opened her\ninnocent looking eyes, desperately\ntrying to elicit sympathy from the\nhandsome human lord. But when the human\nlord drew a long sword made of dragon\nbone, the blood which had no choice but\nto obediently hand over the mine with a\nflash of light, the mine had been seized\nby the invading lord. Continue mining.\nI've already given you the authority.\nThe blood witch leader sent her sister\nwitches dejected to mine the vein. They\nhad barely entered when they screamed in\nsurprise. Wow. What's going on here? The\nmining speed of this vein has increased\ndramatically. It's five times faster\nthan before. The monsters were\nterrified. The blood witch leader's eyes\ndarted around rapidly before she\nsuddenly collapsed at the feet of the\ninvading lord once more. Sherry is\nwilling to surrender. From now on, she\nwill be the lord's exclusive meat and\nexclusive witch. The invading lord was\ntaken aback at first. then nodded in\nsatisfaction. Although I think I\nmisheard some important word just now.\nAll right. From now on, you will be one\nof my subordinates. I will not kill you\nagain, and you can let your sisters go\nback. The leader of the blood witches\nwas overjoyed and let her witches away\nquickly. Those monsters with a brain\nfigured out the reason behind it. This\nlord can give his mine a 5x production\nbonus. Then he takes four fifths and the\noriginal owner takes 1/5. It's\nessentially a no- loss situation.\nAlthough they have lost their freedom,\nthe Lord said he would restrict and\nprevent them from killing each other,\nand it seems like the monsters didn't\nhave a choice either. Seeing that the\nmonsters all seem to be deep in thought,\nthe invading lord continued, \"Hurry up.\nYou should be grateful that you have met\nsuch a benevolent lord as me. I can\naccept a ferocious cyclops, and I don't\nshy away from cunning and bloodthirsty\nwitches. So, what else do you have to\nworry about?\" As soon as the words were\nspoken, the surrounded monsters saw\nseveral tall cyclops appear behind the\ninvaders. This is an epic creature, one\nof the fiercest creatures guarding the\nhigh ridge of Calabash Mountain. Yet, it\nhas surrendered to the invaders. If you\nstubbornly resist, thinking you can\nfight head-on, you'll end up like this\nbunch of goblins. They will be genocide,\nthe leader of the invaders proclaimed.\nNow half of you stay as hostages and the\nother half go and persuade your monster\nneighbors to surrender. Those who fail\nto bring back their neighbors to\nsurrender will suffer the same fate as\nthe goblins. I'll be waiting here for\nyou to come back with good news. The\ninvading army immediately made way for\nthem. With a loud bang, the monsters\nscattered and ran into the valley,\nfearing they would become hostages.\nSeeing this scene, the leader of the\ninvaders smiled with satisfaction. The\nleader of the invaders was naturally\nLynn Shiao. He couldn't be bothered to\nsend his own soldiers to subdue the wild\nmonsters. A lord to recruit wild\nmonsters are complicated. Not to\nmention, not only do they lack manpower,\nbut they also monsters might take\nadvantage of your isolated units and\nattack to eliminate them. Even the\nlowest ranking phantom archer would be\nheartbroken to lose one of his own. This\nis absolutely unacceptable. Moreover,\nthe valley is very large, and even if\nall of our own manpower were put in, we\nwould not be able to complete the task.\nSo, Lynn Sha led his troops to blatantly\nhunt monsters, blocking most of the wild\nmonsters in front of the valley, killing\na batch and letting the rest enter the\nvalley as scout stones. Monsters that\nthey can quickly cover the entire\nvalley, and he won't feel any remorse if\nthey die. These are wild monsters, not\ntroops you recruited yourself. And so\nsome of the wild monsters returned,\nconveying Lyn Xiao's policies and\nmilitary might and also bringing news of\nthe surrender of other wild monsters.\nSome of the wild monsters failed to\nreturn and were devoured by the powerful\nunyielding monsters in the valley. Lyn\nSha waved his hand and led his elite\ntroops to find these tough nuts to\ncrack. And then with the help of the\nlegendary Chinese troops, they crushed\nand annihilated them. As night was about\nto fall, the entire Calabash Valley\nofficially completely. It was taken over\nby Lyn Sha. Lyn Sha sent flower fairies\nand farmers to mine the vacant mines\nthat had been emptied after the\nmassacres. The wild monsters that\nalready occupied the area continued to\noccupy it. And at the same time, the\nwild monsters continued to mine the\nresources. These places don't have a\nsingle farmer or flower fairy of their\nown. Wild monsters just go there to mine\non their own initiative. After mining,\nthe majority of the resources have to be\nhanded over. We should thank Lyn Sha for\nthat. This is something that would make\ncapitalists weep and bosses ashamed.\nEven working people who have to go to\nwork on New Year's Eve would feel like\ncommitting a crime after seeing this.\nLyn Sha opened the resource panel only\nto see that all the resources on it were\nexperiencing an explosive increase. The\nnumbers were jumping up every second. At\nthis point, Lyn Sha possessed all the\nresources and mineral veins of the\nentire Calabash mountain range.\nInexhaustible, inexhaustible. He has\ncompletely occupied the entire Hulu\nmountain range and Hulu Valley. The\nmajor resource problem has been\ncompletely solved. Chapter 99 has only\ntwo days left until the black flame lord\nbreaks through the region and arrives.\nEvening. Dugu Jaolon led his troops back\nto his territory and immediately began\nupgrading his lord's mansion to level\nthree. Upgrade the lord's mansion to\nlevel three. Upon seeing the\nnotification that the lord's manor was\nbeing upgraded, Dugu Jaolon continued to\nuse talismans. Use the speedup spell.\nWith everything settled, Dugu Jaolon\nbreathed a sigh of relief. The\nchattering female soldier beside him\nkept talking. Miss will definitely be\nnumber one again this time. Few people\ncould match this speed in previous\nyears. Dugu Jaalon shook his head. Not\nnecessarily, because I don't have enough\nresources for the upgrade. After the\nsecond tier lord's manor was cooled\ndown, I spent a few days accumulating\nresources. If someone has more\nresources, they might be able to catch\nup later. Even Miss Lean has been\ncollecting upgrade resources for several\ndays. Others will only need more time,\nthe female soldier said confidently. I\ndon't know about others, but he has\nalready created several miracles. Dugu\nJaalon raised his head, half reminiscing\nand half sighing. The female soldier was\na little indignant and wanted to say\nsomething, but she was afraid that she\nwould continue to be punished by\nstanding guard and working the night\nshift, so she swallowed her words. The\nValkyrie beside him seemed to know who\nDugu Jelon was referring to and nodded,\nsaying, \"His hero is very strong. to\ndefeat Dinglay, who was capable of\ndefeating three lords with just one\nmove, his strength should not be\nunderestimated. Judging from what that\nhero in white said, he can only get\nstronger. The Valkyrie with slight\nsurprise. You're interested in this kind\nof thing, too? Marlenia smiled faintly.\nI'm interested in any kind of battle.\nHow do you think you compare to that\nhero in white given your abilities?\nMarlinia was silent for a few seconds\nbefore slowly saying, \"I can easily\ndefeat the three lords, and I can also\ndefeat Dinglay. In fact, if it were a\nrace, I could probably take them all out\neven faster.\" Marlenia then shook her\nhead and said, \"But if I want to finish\nthe battle quickly without killing them,\nI'm not as good as that hero in White,\nso I don't know who is stronger or\nweaker between the two of us.\" Marlene a\nflicked her golden prosthetic arm, a\nlong narrow golden sword slicing through\nthe air, and said, \"Perhaps a\nhead-to-head confrontation is needed to\ndetermine who is superior. Is this your\nevaluation? It's so high.\" The aloof and\nelegant Dugu Jaon, like a lotus flower\nuntouched by the world, was slightly\nsurprised. He really does have a lot of\nsecrets, and even that Archer Gust feels\nstrangely familiar to me. I have a\nfeeling that we will meet him in the\nofficial district.\nWhat's so great about that kid? He\nalways steals first place from the young\nladies. I wish he would never go to the\nofficial area. Unable to hold back any\nlonger, the female soldier finally\nspoke. Dugu Jalon slowly turned around,\nstartling the female soldier who quickly\nlowered her head. Miss I. A faint rhythm\nof heaven and earth resonated around\nthem and Dugu Jalon spoke. You are\nhereby ordered to complete further\ninvestigation of the celestial beings\norganization's information today and\nsubmit it to me. The female soldier\nopened her mouth in surprise. Huh? At\nthe same time, Ding lay in the 89757\nnewbie zone was sitting blankly in his\nlord's mansion. I lost. I lost again. He\nwas defeated by just one of Lin\nXiao&lt;unk&gt;s heroes. Ding Lay was\ndistraught as if he had lost his\nparents. He recalled the masked man and\nwhat he had said and the complete 180°\nturn in his attitude. Wongu no longer\nvalues me. He has given away a large\nnumber of recruitment tokens to those\nscum who slaughtered their compatriots.\nAt least several thousand rare and\nexceptional units in total. That's quite\na generous investment. Dingle clenched\nhis fist. Those bloodthirsty lords were\noriginally just low-level henchmen of\nthe celestial beings organization. They\nwere thrown into the newbie zone and\nmade to kill a certain number of lords\neach. Only those who could survive and\nenter the official zone could join the\ncelestial beings. Become a trainee\nmember. What a despicable organization,\nthe celestials. They're using the newbie\nzone as a training ground for assassins.\nDingle was lost in thought, his\nexpression complex. My original\nintention was to take advantage of the\nopportunity presented by the heavenly\npeople organizations attempt to win me\nover and to seize the chance to compile\na list of these scoundrels who have\nharmed our compatriots and to eliminate\nthem one by one. But Wongu only gave me\ninformation on some insignificant minor\ncharacters, most of whom were weak and\nbloodthirsty lords who were destined to\nbe eliminated because they were clumsy\nand exposed or whose talents and skills\nwere not strong enough. In this way, I\ngained fame by defeating the blood lord,\nand Wong Su was happy to have someone\nclean up the incompetent and defective\nproducts. It seemed like a win-win\nsituation, but I didn't achieve my goal\nat all. How could a topranked expert in\nthe official region fall for my trick so\neasily? Ding Li tried to pull out his\nFrostorn, but found it empty, only then\nrealizing that his beloved weapon had\nbeen stolen. He sighed, unsure of what\nto do. Although I Dingle consider myself\nnot a good person, I am definitely not a\nbad person without principles. I\nsuppressed dissident, I provoked\nconflict, but everything I did did not\nharm the interests of the lords in my\ndistrict. I have never harmed any\ninnocent people, not even the pretty\ngirls. Except for Lyn Shao, Dinglay\nlooked somewhat conflicted. I have\ntargeted Lyn Shao several times,\nstarting with Xiao Daong. And just a few\ndays ago, I even attacked his hero.\nJudging from how Lin Shiao wiped out\nXiao Daong and Gene Dang without a\nsecond thought, I'm afraid I've really\nmade an enemy of him. But what can I do?\nThat's just my talent. Most of what I've\ndone is for this damn talent. Lyn Shia\nis so powerful now, and he will become\neven more powerful. He has also made an\nenemy of mine. If I can't eliminate him\nas soon as possible, all that will\nremain for me is eternal pain and fear.\nIt won't be long before Lynn Shiao kills\nme. Just then, Wong Su called again.\nHere are five excellent recruitment\ntokens and five rare recruitment tokens.\nDingle. Wong Su&lt;unk&gt;s voice was\nextremely cold. This is the last time\nI'll support you. There are only two\ndays left until Black Flames campaign\nagainst Lin Shiao. You know what to do.\nIf you lose again this time, you can\nforget about ever joining our celestial\nbeings organization again. Oh, I\nunderstand. Dinglay replied calmly,\nsaying that he still needed to maintain\nhis public image. Seeing the masked man\nWong Su hang up the phone with a look of\nutter disgust, Ding Lay felt a surge of\nsatisfaction, and his talent received a\nboost of positive energy. After a\nmoment's thought, Ding Lay gritted his\nteeth. If you're going to do something,\ndo it all the time. Let's just go all\nthe way down this path. If you're not\ngoing to deal with Lynn Shiao, you might\nas well kneel down and lick his feet,\nbegging him to spare your life. Would\nyou do that if you were in my shoes?\nChapter 100. The game between the city\nlords faction and the celestial beings.\nAt the same time, Julie, Wong Bo, and\nPans Shan Yu also gathered together.\nTheir troops suffered heavy losses, but\nas the chosen ones, they were too\nembarrassed to ask the city lord for\nsupport. Chu Yusi also wanted to curb\nthe arrogance of these geniuses, so he\ndidn't bring it up. Fortunately,\nChufinga had long understood the three\nsituation. He asked the old man for some\nrecruitment tokens and gave them to the\nthree to replenish their troops. Now,\ntheir forces are almost as strong as\nwhen they crossed regions and may even\nbe stronger. The task assigned to us by\nthe city lord was sabotaged by Ding\nLelay before it even began. Young Pan\nShanu looked worried. The three of us\nhave A-level talent. So why can't we\neven defeat Ding Lay, who is also an\nA-level talent. Wong Bo didn't speak. He\njust crossed his arms and his face was\ndark. Ever since he was defeated by Ding\nLay, he has been full of resentment.\nPerhaps Ding Lays talent lies in rising\nto the occasion against strong\nopponents. But to be honest, we were\nalso careless and underestimated our\nopponents. Only by knowing your\nweaknesses can you catch up. Julie\ncomforted everyone, saying, \"We still\nhave time, so we can use this time to\ngain more experience. Gaining experience\ncan also level us up, and once we reach\na certain level, our combat power will\nalso increase. But what about resources?\nIf we focus on experience, we'll fall\nbehind in resources, and we won't be\nable to quickly advance to the third\ntier. At a time like this, why are you\nstill worried about resources, Jill Dao?\nWe are all part of the city lord's\nfaction and our honor and disgrace are\nall tied to the city lord. To put it\nbluntly, what others consider\nunattainable, such as the excellent\nrecruiting token or even the epic\nrecruiting token, is not a rare thing\nfor the city lord. As long as we\ncomplete the task well, there will\nnaturally be a reward. Jilly slowly\nsaid, \"Besides, do you think it's\nworthwhile for us to try to reach level\nthree now? We only have 2 days. Even if\nwe manage to complete level three, we'll\nstill have to deal with the demonic tide\nafter recruiting heroes. By the time\nwe've dealt with the demonic tide, Black\nFlame will probably have already hung\nLin Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s corpse on the flag pole.\nThe mission has failed completely, and\nthe city lord will not let us off\neasily. Wong Bo and Pans Shan Yu\nremained silent. Wong Bo, how many types\nof soldiers do you have? The burly Wong\nBo said in a deep voice. 100 are rare,\n50 are outstanding. I am rare at 80,\noutstanding at 50. Pansyu replied, I\nhave 120 rare units, 60 excellent units,\nand 10 epic units. Wong Bo and Pans\nShanu suddenly looked up at Julie. You\nused your family's troops. Julie nodded\nslowly. That's right. Pans Shan Yu\nsuddenly asked, \"Is it worth it? It's\njust protecting Lyn Sha. It's not like\nyou're going to fight a full-fledged\ndistrict lord one-on-one. WBO also said,\n\"Based on past experience, the lords who\narrive after breaking through a region\nusually only bring a few hundred troops.\nEven if you bring a full force of 1,000\npeople, mostly rare and superior units.\nThat's enough to crush any lord in the\nbeginner area because epic level units\nare extremely rare, even in the official\nzones. So with our troops plus Fong Ji's\ntroops, we have several hundred rare\ntroops and more than 200 outstanding\ntroops, which should be enough to save\nLinhao's life. The destruction of the\nregion will last for 3 days. If we just\nhelp it hold out for 3 days, everything\nwill be over. And you you actually used\nall your own epic units? No. Julie shook\nhis head. We were exposed the moment\nDing Lay specifically targeted us. So, I\nhad a feeling this time wouldn't be so\nsimple. Perhaps we don't need so many\npowerful troops to deal with Lin Sha.\nBut what if we could also weaken Lord\nShu's power along the way? And don't\nforget, although Dinglay lost, since the\nCelestials can support Ding Lay, they\nmight be able to support even more\npeople to launch an attack in\ncoordination with Black Flame. Wong Bo\nand Pans Shan Yu exchanged a glance,\ntheir expressions grave. Now that things\nhave come to this, we have no choice but\nto fight with all our might. We must\nprove our worth so as not to disgrace\nthe city lord. The three looked at each\nother and finally nodded emphatically at\nthe same time. All right, let's go grind\nexperience tomorrow morning. Monster\ntreasure house, house of the dead, and\nsoul tower. Anywhere that gives a lot of\nexperience and can drop recruitment\ntokens will go grind. At the same time,\nthe barracks will continue to recruit\nsoldiers. Strive to upgrade all troop\ntypes to the highest level in two days.\nDefeat Dinglay, defeat Black Flame, and\navenge our defeat. At this moment,\nwithin the official area, the masked\nman, Wong Su patted a man of medium\nbuild with small eyes, thin lips, and a\nscar on his face. Black Flame, it's time\nfor you to make contributions to the\norganization again. Understood, brother.\nBlack Flame's voice was as horse as a\nmale ducks, as if his throat had been\ninjured. I have participated in 59 large\nand small district conquests and never\nlost. I have killed 55 novice lords. The\nremaining four barely escaped with their\nlives. This was just an accidental\ncrushing of an ant. Why make such a\nfuss, brother? No, no, no. Wong Su shook\nhis head. Although Lin Shiao is strong,\nhe's nothing special. But the master's\nintention is to take advantage of Chu\nYusi's ignorance and wipe out his entire\nforce. Xioli, Wong, Bo, and Pans Shan Yu\nare also targets that must be\neliminated. I heard that Chu Yusi's son\nis also in that newbie zone. If he\ndoesn't show up, fine, but if he does,\nyou can take care of him while you're at\nit. Black Flame's eyes flashed with a\nsharp light, and he nodded heavily.\nWe've been suppressed too much in the\nDragon Sea Kingdom. This time, we'll\nfight back on the battlefield of all\nraces. Very good. Wong Su took out a\nlong broadsword and handed it to Black\nFlame. This is Black Flame's tiny eyes\nwidened in surprise. That's right. It's\none of your epic weapons, the sword in\nthe stone. I'll lend it to you for now.\nKeep this safe. Take this sword. chop\noff Linhao&lt;unk&gt;s doghead head and let\neveryone know the power of us\ncelestials. Although it was only a\ntemporary loan, Black Flame was still\nfilled with excitement and couldn't help\nbut hold the sword in the stone and\nexamine it closely. I will definitely\nkill Lin Shia, that fool who doesn't\nknow his own death, and bring glory to\nthe heavenly people organization. Wong\nSu hummed in agreement and continued to\nask, \"Are all the troops ready?\" Black\nFlame laughed, sheathed the sword in the\nstone, and said, \"Of course, of course.\nThis time, the master has really gone\nall out. With this troop configuration,\nI'm almost confident I can break into\nthe top 100 in the official server, and\nhe's using it to fight a newbie lord.\"\nWong Su drawled out the sound. Black\nFlame understood and hurriedly smiled\napologetically. \"Brother, please calm\ndown. I meant that our troops are\nextremely powerful. How easy is it to\nget into the top 100 in the official\nzone? Wongu said dissatisfied. Young\nman, you still need to mature and gain\nmore experience. Brother is right. Black\nFlame nodded and bowed as the two\narrived at their own square. Looking at\nthe neatly arranged and disciplined\ntroops before him, Wongu nodded in\nsatisfaction. The celestial beings\norganization has really gone all out\nthis time. You can only bring 1,000\ntroops, but here are 100 legendary gold\ntroops and 900 epic troops. Haha, big\nbrother. I knew the adults were being\ntoo cautious. 100 epic units are enough\nto wipe out all the lords in the entire\nnewbie zone. As a result, the adults\ngave me 100 legendary gold units and 900\nepic units. I've never even dreamed of\nleading such a powerful army. When the\ntopic of this unit came up, even Black\nFlame's gloomy face lit up. I now have\nchapter 101 summoning new heroes of\nChina, unparalleled Patriot. I now have\n100 legendary gold level Templar\nknights, a fortress that is said to be\nimpregnable. And there's also the\nlongest range archer on the entire\nbattlefield, the one who never sets in\nthe world. This is a national treasure\nof the British Empire, Black Flame\nproudly declared. And then there are the\ndwarven mountain warriors, the best at\nmountain warfare. These are all epic\nlevel mountain warfare experts. They\ncould easily surround Lynsha. His\ncowardly turtlike posture is practically\nhis own prison. The strongest ground\nspearman of epic rank, the Blazing Sun\nSpearman. The strongest epic level\nattack power, Ironclad Crusader. There\nare even epic assassin units\nspecifically designed to counter Lin\nXiao's overalls archers and Gust\narchers. Which of these troop types\nisn't famous and renowned? A force to be\nreckoned with on the battlefield among\nall races. Even if the level cap is\nlowered to 30, who can fight in the\nnewbie zone? The level cap in the newbie\nzone is 30. To be honest, the adults are\nbeing too cautious. Haha. Faced with the\nblack flames ecstasy, arrogance, and\neven disdain. Wong Su simply smiled and\nshook his head, he felt the same way.\nWith these troops, we're completely\nsafe. Three heroes stood upright in\nfront of a neatly arranged ranks of\nsoldiers. And these three heroes, big\nbrother, Black Flame explained. Neagano\nthe Predator. My all-around strongest\nhero. The sword saint of limitless\nswords. E the strongest one-on-one\nfighter. The master specially lent him\nto me temporarily. I refuse to believe\nthat Lyn Xiao's whiteclad hero can be\nstronger than him. And this esteemed\nGrandmaster of the Knights of Rome.\nBlack Flame bowed slightly in respect.\nThis is the captain of the Golden Legend\nteam, the Knights Templar, a Golden\nLegend hero. Rome. Wong Su also bent\ndown, a esteemed Germanic hero of pure\nblood. Rome didn't look to the side and\nnodded slightly in response, but Wong Su\nand Black Flame didn't care at all. The\ntwo were overjoyed to finally see the\nprepared troops and heroes. With this\nsetup, I really can't imagine who could\nbeat me. Does your excellency wish to\nestablish your prestige through a\nbattle? Wong Su said. Chu Yusi and the\nothers thought we would just use some\nrare and excellent units as usual, but\nthey didn't expect that the Lord would\nsend out the most elite, epic, and\nlegendary units. This time, we're going\nto catch him completely offguard.\nBesides you, there are many other\nbloodthirsty lords in the newbie zone,\nand I have already made arrangements for\nthem. At least several thousand rare and\nsuperior units will cooperate to attack\nLin Shiao and Chu Yuzi's forces. My god,\nthis is powerful. This time it could\nreally wipe out the entire newbie zone.\nNo, no, don't wipe them all out. The\nfemale lords in the newbie zone are\nquite a treat. After all, they've all\njust come of age. Haha. So, once we\nenter the newbie zone, we must be\nhigh-profile. Let everyone see how\npowerful we are. Yes, brother. There are\nonly two days left until the black\nflames descend. Night. The Lord's\nMansion at the entrance of Holian\nMountain. As before, Lyn Shao sat\nquietly in the square, waiting. Behind\nthem stood a neatly arranged,\ndisciplined army. At the very front were\nhis own white-clad swordsmen, Pay Min,\nand the redroed female general, Chin\nLeonu. Next came the iron guards with\nlong swords, the archers with divine\narms, the white-shaped spearmen, the\nphantom archers, and the flower fairies.\nThere was also a bewitching and\nbeautiful bloodthirsty witch who stood\nbehind the soldiers trembling with fear\nyet forcing herself to muster her\ncourage. The three lords mansions is\nabout to be completed. What follows is\nrecruiting three heroes, building\nstables, and fighting against the\ndemonic tide. Then 2 days later, we'll\ndeal with the black flame. Of course,\nthere is also a high probability that he\nwill have to deal with Ding Li and many\nmore novice lords bribed by the\nCelestial People organization. At the\nsame time, Lyn Shiao is never arrogant,\nnor does he underestimate his enemies.\nHe constantly calculated all his\nresources and possessions in his mind\nand planned for every possible loophole.\nLords all resources panel experience\n68,759,462\nover 60 million gold coins 5,876,910\nover 5 million. Ever since she finally\nconsummated her marriage with Baoi, she\nwas in a great mood like a newlywed\nbride and a joke could often make her\ngiggle. Now Ba chases after Lynn Shiao\neveryday. Let him tell a joke from a TV\nseries. My mom is a jam. I'm ashamed of\nmyself. Zerum has also worked very hard\nthis year. However, Lynn Shiao didn't\nsee any benefit from the ancient demon's\npromise of 100 points of loyalty being\nbroken. He planned to ask the ancient\ndemon about it next time he met him.\nTreasure chest. Excellent treasure\nchests, zero. Rare treasure chests,\nzero. Excellent treasure chest zero.\nEpic chests zero. Legendary treasure\nchest zero. Lynn Sha opened all the\ntreasure chests and they were mostly\nfilled with resources and equipment.\nNothing particularly outstanding. He\ngave the ordinary equipment to his\nsubordinates and sold the rest. But he\nstill couldn't collect his own scale\nrock set. Props. Two purple excellent\nquality defense runes. One blue rare\nquality hero token. Seven common\nrecruitment tokens. Three rare\nrecruitment tokens. One epic recruitment\ntoken. Teleportation scroll three. Camp\nscroll two. Golden legend. Hashiatalu\nbuilding blueprint one. Perspective\nsymbol two. Sky curtain symbol one. Lyn\nSha used all the civilian talismans as\nsoon as he got them. But he kept the\nrecruitment talismans on hold, waiting\nto fill in any gaps. Equipment. No\nchanges slightly. The only difference\nwas the addition of frost which had\nsimilar attributes to ashbringer and\nLynn Shiao gave it to pay men to use. He\nhimself wields the holy sword falin and\nthe magic spear Bryan. Special\nbattlefield energy of all races 8750.\nResources absolutely no shortage.\nDetails will be omitted if there are no\nspecial resources later. Food not much\nabsolutely no shortage. units. Iron\nguards with the MO Dao sword, all at\nlevel 15, with divine crossbows, all at\nlevel 15. There are 49 phantom archers,\nall at level 20. 34 White Spearmen, all\nlevel 15. Hero, Sword, Saint Pay Min,\nlevel 15. Ba, level two. Chin, Leong,\nYu, level 15. I have enough experience\nnow to upgrade all my units and heroes\nto level 20, but I still need to save\nsome experience for my tier three heroes\nand units. As for the equipment for the\nthree heroes, it is indeed a bit scarce.\nIf it is a hero who uses a gun or a\nsword, I can lend him one of my own\nweapons. I still have a total of 11\nrecruitment tokens, which can summon 110\nlegendary golden units of China at any\ntime as long as I have enough energy.\nThe current energy level is 87,500.\nHopefully, that's enough because Lynn\nShia wanted to set conditions, summon\nspecific Chinese heroes. This attempt\nwill be even bolder. Lyn Sha went\nthrough all his resources again to\nconfirm that everything was correct.\nJust then, the tier three lord's mansion\nwas upgraded. Ding. Lyn Shao, a player\nfrom the L Nan region of Blue Star\nRealm, has successfully upgraded to tier\nthree, becoming the top tier three\nplayer in Lan region this year. System\nreward plus one hero slot. System\nreward, one epic chest. The moment the\nsounded, Lyn Shia immediately stood up.\nSend a farmer to build a stable\nimmediately. Then he took out a hero's\ntoken. Exchange for Hashia token energy.\nConsume one energy point to use the\nHasha token. Huha summoning function to\nsummon a Hasha hero. Hasha immediately\ndeducts 1,000 battlefield energy points.\nThen Lynn Shiao continued, \"Continue to\nconsume the energy of the battlefield of\nmyriad races and set the conditions for\nthis Hasha summoning. The description of\nthe hero to be recruited is unparalleled\nhero. Ding. Your Hasha token energy is\ninsufficient. Chapter 10 O2. Sealing the\nwolf and dwelling in the wilderness. Not\nenough energy. 87,500\nenergy points. Enough for 87.5 regular\nsummons. And you still don't have\nenough. Hearing the system notification\nthat the Hasha tokens energy was\ninsufficient. Lynn Shia was not\ndiscouraged, but continued, \"The\nrequirements for this Hasha summoning\nevent have been changed. The hero\ndescription to be recruited must be a\nparagon of virtue. Ding. Your hua token\nenergy is insufficient. Lyn Sha broke\nout in a slight sweat. Just as expected.\nThe requirements for recruiting Han Xen\nand Li Jing were too high. One is a\nmilitary genius, the other a military\ngod. They certainly weren't so easy to\nrecruit. Even during the Lunar New Year,\nyou might not have this luck. Let's try\nagain with two more candidates. The\nevent have been changed. The hero to be\nrecruited must be Marque Wuan. Ding. The\nwords used by Marque Wuan are incorrect.\nPlease replace them with more relevant\nwords described as human butcher. Ding.\nYour Hasha token energy is insufficient.\nLyn Sha returns. The requirements for\nthis Hasha summoning event have been\nchanged. The hero to be recruited must\nbe described as the author of the art of\nwar. Ding. Your Hasha token energy is\ninsufficient. Another failure. Lin Shiao\ntried all the people he considered to be\nin the top tier, but none of them\nworked. Time is of the essence. The\ndemonic tide is imminent. Then let's use\nthe second tier candidates. The\nrequirements for this Hashia summoning\nrecruited must be described as fang juu.\nDing. Five people have been found who\nmeet this requirement. Your hasha token\nenergy is insufficient. Lynsha took a\ndeep breath. Calm down. Calm down. The\ncondition is that there are five people\ninvolved, meaning all five are counted\ntogether. So, the Hasha order's energy\nis insufficient. It's not that the\nChinese nation's energy is insufficient\nas described in the phrase sealing the\nwolf and residing in the sue. In Chinese\nhistory, there were five people who\nachieved the feat of sealing the wolf's\nlair. Let's add another limiting\ncondition to narrow down the scope.\nAdditional conditions for this Hasha\nsummoning event. The hero to be\nrecruited is described as follows.\nCondition one, Fun Langu. Condition two,\nthe Shu have not been destroyed. How can\nI have a home? Ding. Summoning\nsuccessful. After Lin Sha finished\nspeaking, a seven-colored light flashed,\nand a gate of light appeared in the\nterritory. It's done. A figure riding a\nwhite horse slowly stepped out of the\nportal. He was dressed in golden helmet\nand armor with a silver white fur\ntrimmed cloak tied around his shoulders,\nfluttering and rustling in the wind. He\nwas tall and strong with fair skin and\nclear bright eyes. He was indeed a\nhandsome young general. He held a long\nspear in his hand, sat proudly on his\nhorse, and looked majestic. The golden\narmored young general tilted his head,\nand within seconds, the god system had\nfed him all the relevant information\nabout the battlefield of the myriad\nraces. He immediately dismounted and\nwalked towards Lyn Shao. Lynsha\nimmediately went to meet him. This\nhumble general, Hitsubing, pays his\nrespects to your lordship. I am willing\nto serve your lordship. The young\ngeneral in golden armor knelt on one\nknee and immediately swore allegiance to\nLyn Sha. Great. It really is Hoiting.\nLyn Sha suppressed his excitement and\nhelped up the hero he had painstakingly\nrecruited. Then he thought to himself,\n\"Check Hoitsubing&lt;unk&gt;s attributes.\nMarquee of championing.\nRace human.\nQuality golden legend. Level level one.\nAttributes strength 60 + 12 spirit 60 +\n12 constitution 42 + 8 soul 38 + 8\nskills sealing the wolf's nest drinking\nhorses from the vast sea.

His combat\nstrength is rated 59 stars which is\nslightly above average. He is slightly\nstronger than Chin Leang Yu but not as\nstrong as pay men. The body attribute is\ntoo low and the soul attribute is too\nlow. Perhaps this is why Huubing died\nyoung. Lyn Sha thought to himself.\nHitsubing should eat more spirit rice\nand spirit fish to nourish his body.\nBecause he needed to prepare for the\nimpending demonic tide, Lin Shiao could\nonly briefly check a few skills. Finland\nJakutsuing\nas the first person to create the\nstrongest honor for military generals\nthroughout history enjoys a lofty status\namong all soldiers. Hitsubing and his\ntroops deal 50% more damage to any\nnon-han race. They deal 100% more damage\nto the race of any enemy that has\nseverely harmed any race under the\nLord's command. An unprecedented sense\nof honor. The loyalty of the troops led\nby Huubing increased by 20%. Goodness,\nit directly increases the damage of the\nentire race. In this world, only the Han\nChinese exist, meaning that\nHoitsubing&lt;unk&gt;s damage to anyone he\nattacks is increased by 50%. If a\ncertain race has seriously harmed him,\nwill deal 100% more damage when he\nattacks them. This is twice as powerful\nas the abyss demon's skill. No wonder it\ncreated the magnificent feat of sealing\nthe wolf's slayer. Unparalleled\ncharm/heaven's\njealousy. Hitsubing was 18 years old\nwhen he became a cavalry captain. He led\n800 cavalrymen deep into the desert and\ntwice achieved the greatest merit in the\nentire army and was in theft as the\nmarquee of champion. His charisma not\nonly captivated his subordinates but\nalso his enemies. When Hitsubing\npersuades cavalry type enemies to\nsurrender, the success rate increases by\n50%. Hitsubing could lead any type of\ncavalry. Negative impact. Hoitsubing was\nenvied by the heavens and although he\nwas healthy, he was always at risk of\ndying young. Seeing this, Lyn Shao\nsighed and shook his head slightly.\nHeaven is jealous of heroes. In short,\nLyn Sha was extremely satisfied. Yubing\nwas simply the ultimate template for a\ncavalry general. It even included the\nonly SS level commander Lin Shiao had\never seen. Cavalry command. SS level\nincreases all attributes of all cavalry\nunder your command by 100%.\nUnbelievable. Absolutely unbelievable.\nSubing, please rise quickly. Four\ngeneral type heroes. The main god has\nchanged their allegiance, making them\nnaturally easy to recruit. Lyn Sha\nhelped Huubing up. What a fine young\ngeneral. After saying that, he took a\ntalisman from his own body and\nimmediately hung it around\nHoitsubing&lt;unk&gt;s neck. Life protecting\namulet quality purple excellent\nattribute increases constitution by 30\nimproving the wearer's wound healing\nspeed and body recovery speed.\nIntroduction This is a talisman blessed\nby a necromancer. Its origins unknown.\nNo matter how weak a person is, wearing\nthis life protecting amulet will grant\nthem a physique comparable to a bison.\nHowever, never remove it lightly. The\nweakness experienced when leaving it\nwill cause excruciating pain. The moment\nthe talisman was removed, even someone\nas strong as Lin Sha felt a slight pain,\nbut he still smiled and personally put\nthe talisman on Hoitsubing in front of\nhim. Hoitubing stood there dumbfounded.\nHe hadn't expected his lord to pull this\nstunt right from the start. Have endured\nunparalleled pain to remove him. My lord\nChu Bing, no need for further words, Lyn\nShao said in a deep voice. I know you\nare brave and strong, but being brave\nand strong is what the soldiers expect\nof you. Taking care of your health is\nwhat I expect of you. Hoing swayed\nslightly, then immediately knelt down on\none knee again and shouted. Subing is\nwilling to die for your lord. Ding! Your\nhero Hoying&lt;unk&gt;s loyalty has reached\n100%, ready to go through fire and\nwater. Lynn Sha nodded happily. You may\ndie for me later, but to kill the enemy\nfor me is the opportunity. Chu Bing, the\ndemonic tide is coming soon. I'll\nrecruit troops for you. Lyn Sha was\nabout to take out the recruitment token\nand use the Hasha token to recruit\ncavalry when Upon closer inspection, he\nwas horrified. Chapter 103. The Guan\nNing iron cavalry makes their debut.\nUpon inspection, Lyn Shao discovered\nthat his hua order myriad races\nbattlefield energy had dwindled to only\n11,500.\nJust now, in order to recruit Huubing, I\nset certain conditions which directly\nconsumed 76,000 battlefield energy. This\ngeneral is really expensive, but worth\nit. 1,000 battlefield energy can be\nexchanged for one Hasha token energy and\none Hasha token energy can be used once\nfor Hasha summoning. My Lord's Manor is\nonly at level three and the demonic tide\nis about to strike. The stables have\njust been built and will be completed in\n48 hours. It's too late to build hero\nspecific buildings now. The best\nsolution is to immediately use the\nrecruitment token to replenish what\nYubing's troops. Hoits Yubing's\nexclusive troop type was cavalry without\nspecifying any particular type of\ncavalry. Any cavalry unit could shine\nunder Hitsub&lt;unk&gt;s command. I happen to\nhave 11 recruitment tokens left. Should\nI use them all to summon soldiers in\nChina and gamble on my luck? Are you\nbetting that he'll summon only cavalry?\nNo. Although Lynn Shiao possesses the\nfortune to bring peace and prosperity to\nall generations and has great luck, he\ndoesn't want to gamble. Because luck\nmanifests in many ways. If the 11\nrecruitment tokens summon 11 different\ngolden legendary Chinese soldiers, Lyn\nSha doesn't know who could command them\nwell in the absence of Han Xen or Li\nJing. After a moment's thought, Lyn Sha\ndecided to use only the simplest\nlimiting conditions. He took out five\nrecruitment tokens. Use Hwasha summoning\nto consume the energy of the myriad\nraces battlefield and summon a Hashia\nexclusive unit limited to cavalry of the\nsame type. As soon as he finished\nspeaking, Lyn Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s battlefield\nenergy was completely exhausted. As long\nas it's a legendary gold tier cavalry\nunit, it can't be bad. Lyn Shao thought\nto himself. Iron Pagod, Iron Falcon,\nBayway Army, Great Han Champion Cavalry,\nWhite Horse Cavalry, Tiger and Leopard\nCavalry, or even the Eight Banners Iron\nCavalry would be fine. As Lin Xiao's\nvoice fell, the five recruitment tokens\nrose directly into the sky, eventually\nbecoming golden talismans engraved with\napicious fivecolored clouds and\npatterned with mythical beasts at the\nbottom. The portal roared, and the sound\nof horses hooves approached. The lead\nknight leaped out of the portal and\njumped out on his horse. A tall imposing\nhorseman clad in iron armor with a long\nsword at his waist, a lance on his\nhorse, and a sword in his hand.\nThree-eyed musket. Ding. Congratulations\non obtaining the legendary gold unit,\nGuan Ning Iron Cavalry. So it was the\nGuan Ning Iron Cavalry. Lyn Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s\nheart, which had been hanging in\nsuspense, finally settled down. These\nknights rode their war horses forward\nwith agility. One, two. Their war horses\nwere tall and powerful, covered from\nhead to body with studded cotton armor.\nThe knights wore studded cotton armor on\nthe outside, interlocking iron armor\nunderneath, and iron helmets on their\nheads. A breastplate was embedded in the\ncotton armor, revealing two iron armored\narms. The knights were well equipped and\ncomplete, each carrying a bow, a quiver\nof arrows, a long sword, and a long\nspear. But the most eye-catching item\nwas the long-handled three-barreled\nmusket, which was more than 2 m long.\nThe upper part was a musket that could\nfire three shots at once. After firing\nthe musket, it could be picked up and\nused as a mace. 50 knights leaped out of\nthe portal on horseback and instantly\nreceived information from the god\nsystem. The knights dismounted\nsimultaneously, their movements\nperfectly synchronized. 50 knights lined\nup and came before Lin Shiao, kneeling\non one knee. Greetings, Lord. Check the\nattributes of the Guan Ning Iron\nCavalry. Guan Ning iron cavalry. Lieng\nrace human.\nLevel one. Quality legend. Attributes.\nStrength 35 + 7 spirit 28 + 6.\nConstitution 30 + 6 soul 10 plus two\ncombat power rating 31 stars attributes\nadded by skills equipment lord abilities\netc are not included in the combat power\nrating skills peerless warrior spirit\nthree-eyed musket breakthrough charge\nsoldiers follow generals courage behind\nthem the patrolman's warnings rang out\nthe demonic tide was surging in Lyn Sha\nknew there was no time to look at the\nskills and attributes of the Guan Ning\nIron Cavalry. So he immediately waved\nhis hand and upgraded Hoitsubing and the\nGuing Iron Cavalry to level 15. The\nGuing Iron Cavalry, \"Your future general\nis this man, Marquee of Champion,\nHitsubing.\" Lyn Shao pointed and the\nGuan Ning cavalry looked at each other\nslightly taken aback. One of the lead\nknights raised his head. \"Sir, my name\nis Liing Long and I am the squad leader.\nPlease enlighten us, your lordship, that\nmarqueeing is a famous general of the\nHan dynasty, a hero in our hearts, and\nwe will not allow anyone else to\nimpersonate him. The Guan Ning Iron\nCavalry is indeed unruly, Lin Sha\nthought to himself. But as long as the\ngeneral is strong enough, the Guan Ning\niron cavalry can be used very smoothly.\nHistorically, the Guan Ning cavalry was\nmore like a private army or household\nguards, only fierce when fighting\nalongside their lord. Lyn Sha laughed\nand pointed to the side. This is the\nTang Dynasty's Mod Dao Wal weapon. He\nthen pointed to the other end. This is a\nmaster archer from the Great Song\nDynasty. Pointing to a spot not far\naway, he said, \"These are the White\nSpear soldiers from your era. This is\nGeneral Chin Leangu. Do you remember\nher? Now you understand, right? This is\nthe battlefield where all races v for\nsupremacy. The person before you is none\nother than the champion marquee, whose\nbravery surpassed that of the three\narmies thousands of years ago. The\nknights hesitated for a moment, then\nlooked at the golden armored general\nstanding in front of them. He had a\nhandsome face, fair skin, and clear\nfeatures. He wore golden armor and a\nsilver fur trimmed cloak, looking\nmajestic and imposing. Although he was\nonly a young man in his early 20s, his\neyes were firm and he looked around with\nself-confidence, showing a unique charm.\nThe knights finally realized that the\nperson in front of them was indeed\nHitubing. Greetings, Marquee Champion.\nThe Guan Ning Iron Cavalry are willing\nto follow you to the death, my lord and\nmarquee champion. The knights shouted in\nunison. Hitsubing accepted the knights\nrespect without hesitation. He was 100%\nloyal to Lin Shiao and naturally had no\nworries that Lin Shiao might fear his\nachievements overshadowing his master.\nHoing incorporated the Guan Ning iron\ncavalry, instantly increasing all\ncavalry attributes by 100%. The demonic\ntide has reached within 500 meters of\nLin Xiao's territory. My lord, allow me\nto fight the enemy and defend our\ncountry. Go everyone, follow me and\ncrush the demonic tide. Hitsubing\nimmediately led the Guan Ning cavalry\naway. With only 50 cavalrymen, their\ngalloping momentum was like that of a\nthousand troops. Here, the iron guards\nof the MO Dao, the archers of the divine\narm archers, the white-shaped spearmen,\nand the phantom archers are all ready to\nmeet the first wave of the demonic tide.\nThis time there are still endless\nmonsters and demonic creatures led by\nnest demons and abyss demons twice as\nmany as in the second level. But Lynn\nshouted not see the onehorn brands. The\ndemonic army is less than 200 m from the\nterritory. Just as the archer was about\nto fire his arrow, he heard a whoosh of\nwind and saw a knight in golden armor\nleading 50 cavalrymen charging out into\nthe demonic tide, accelerating\nrelentlessly like a sharp sword.\nKillsubing\ntook the lead, followed by all the Guan\nNing cavalry who raised their spears and\nplunged them straight into the bodies of\none demon after another. Behind them,\nthe iron guards with Modo Dao, a type of\nlong-handled sword, and the White Pole\nspearman followed up, quickly finishing\noff the attackers and regaining their\nfooting. The archers and phantom archers\nalso rushed out of Lin Xiao's territory,\nfiring at one enemy after another. With\nthe cavalry charging, the atmosphere\ninstantly became heated. The Guan Ning\ncavalry plunged into the middle of the\ndemonic tide with a whoosh, their\nmomentum unddeinished. Then it pierced\nthrough the demon tide. Then following\nHoitzubing, they turned around again and\ncontinued their charge. Countless\ncorpses of demons and soldiers flew into\nthe sky. No one could stand against this\ncavalry army that had formed a charging\nformation. Chapter 104. A great defeat\nto the demon tide, shocking all sides.\nAmidst the demonic tide, the Guan Ning\niron cavalry is leading the charge. With\nthe addition of cavalry, Lynhao's army's\ncombat power has greatly increased.\nLynho's troops had completely taken\ntheir positions and were pushing back\nagainst the demonic tide. The Guan Ning\niron cavalry are currently enjoying\nmultiple skill bonuses from Hitsubing,\nincluding cavalry command, SS level,\nsealing the wolf mountain, drinking from\nthe vast sea, and using war to sustain\nwar, resulting in explosive attack\npower. They had never experienced such\nan exhilarating battle. Lynn Shiao had\nalready seen the skills cavaler\ncommander SS level and sealing the wolf\nand dwelling in the mount. Taking\nadvantage of his free time, he clicked\nto check out the other skills. Drinking\nfrom the vast sea, Hoitzubing's army was\nnot afraid of the deserts of the north\nor the desolate Gobi Desert. They could\nunleash even greater combat power in\nspecific terrains. Hitsubing and his\ntroops have a 50% increase in movement\nspeed, 50% increase in endurance, 50%\nincrease in morale, and a 50% decrease\nin logistical supply requirements when\noperating on grasslands, Gobi deserts,\nwastelands, deserts, plateaus, plains,\nand ice fields. Hatsubing was not afraid\nof getting lost. He could accurately\nfind his target and was unaffected by\nthe fog of war or various stealth\nskills. Lin Shao was very satisfied with\nthis skill which included acceleration,\nincreased battery life, reduced supply\nrequirements, and satellite positioning.\nMoreover, its adaptability to terrain,\nincluding almost all flat terrain, is\npractically a stimulant for cavalry.\nLynho's territory is surrounded by\nmountain ridges, but the valley inside\nis quite large, practically a small\nplane. Using war to sustain war,\nHoitzubing was able to lead a small\nnumber of soldiers on a long-d\ndistanceance raid of thousands of miles,\nwhich was inseparable from his\noutstanding ability to sustain war\nthrough war. Hoitubing and his troops\nkill enemies. They can gain more\nexperience and gold coins. They can also\nplunder the enemy's food, stamina, and\nenergy, and under special circumstances,\na health recovery mechanism will be\ntriggered. Lyn Sha nodded secretly.\npowerful too powerful. This is a skill\nthat allows you to heal while fighting\nand it's a group skill at that. As\nexpected of Hortzubing, this wave of\ndemonic energy is in the bag. Lin Shia\nwas resisting the demonic tide.\nCountless people in the Lan region,\nvarious newbie zones, and Lord Mansions\nheard the announcement from the god\nsystem. Ding. Lyn Shao, a player from\nthe LN Nan region of Blue Star Realm,\nhas successfully upgraded to tier three,\nbecoming the top tier three player in\nLan region this year. System reward plus\none hero slot. System reward, one epic\nchest. In the 9527 newbie zone, Dugu\nJalon's delicate body trembled slightly\nas she broke free from her meditation,\nher gaze deep as she looked into the\ndistance. The female soldier next to her\nhad her mouth agape wide enough to fit\nan egg. Marlene slowly attached the\ngolden prosthetic arm, a slight smile\ncurving her lips beneath the Valkyrie\nmask. In the 89757\nnewbie zone, Ding lays body trembled,\nhis anus tightened, and he was so\nfrightened that he dropped the long\nsword in his hand to the ground. He then\nlooked around to make sure no one was\nwatching him, shook his head, and slowly\npicked up the long knife, his face\ncontorted with struggle. Finally, he\ngritted his teeth, his eyes growing even\nmore determined. In the same newbie\nzone, Chufingo was first stunned, then\nburst into laughter. He instinctively\nwanted to call Lin Sha, but worried that\nLin Sha was currently fighting against\nthe demonic tide, so he dialed Chu\nYusi's contact number instead. Julie\nWong Bo and Pans Sha Yu were sitting\ntogether reviewing the gains and losses\nof today's battle. Hearing the\nannouncement, both Wong Bo and Pans Shan\nYu wore expressions of shock. Only Julie\nsighed softly, revealing the way things\nshould be. In the same newbie zone, Tu\nShawn by Chien, who was diligently\ngnawing on a chicken leg, heard the\nannouncement and her eyes sparkled with\nexcitement. She immediately entered the\nchat channel and while munching on a\nchicken leg, she happened to run into\nheay who had come online. The two\nexchanged a knowing smile and\nimmediately began their battle of\nbragging about their boss. In the formal\narea, the man in the floral shirt lying\nbetween two voluuptuous bodies also\nheard the district-wide announcement. He\nwas stunned for two seconds, then\nlaughed dismissively. He is indeed a\ngenius, but unfortunately he is not my\ngenius. I'll give you hope for now. Two\ndays from now, all that will be left for\nyou is despair. In another large lord's\nmansion in the formal district, Wong Su\nwith his hooked nose was not wearing a\nmask and was drinking tea and chatting\nwith Hi Yin. Upon hearing the\nannouncement from the main god system,\nthe two were initially incredulous. They\nthen looked at each other and burst into\nwild laughter. At the same time, an\nunprecedented massive amount of chat\nmessages erupted in all the newbie chat\nchannels. Someone has already\nsuccessfully upgraded to a third tier\nuniversity so quickly. Lyn Sha, as\nexpected of Lyn Sha, that genius is\nback. Lyn Sha is awesome. An endless sea\nof lava, black islands, and white\npalaces. The stunning succubus heard the\nsystem announcement through special\nchannels. She suddenly stood up and\nkicked away the onehorned abyss demon\nwho was kneeling at her feet drawing\ncircles. What are you standing there\nfor? Get to work. Huh? You're going\nagain. Nonsense. If someone with your\nexperience can't handle it, how can he\ngrow quickly? Your highness, I have an\n800year-old mother to support and\nchildren to raise. Roll. Upon seeing the\none-horned abyss demon, it scrambled to\nescape while the succubuses s lips\ncurled into a breathtaking smile. She\nseemed to be in a good mood, and with a\nswaying cat-like gate, she turned and\nwalked back to her throne. The surging\nwaves in front of her swaying with each\nstep. Considering you've shown some\nintegrity, this princess will let\nbygones be bygones for your mistake of\nseeking pleasure with other women. He he\ngrow up quickly. Further a field, amidst\na vast complex of westernstyle manners,\nlies a low-key palace that still retains\nits Chinese architectural style. A\nstunningly beautiful woman, aloof and\nelegant, bearing a striking resemblance\nto lonely Garan, but with a more mature\nappearance, received a call from Chui\nwhile dealing with piles of documents.\nAfter hanging up the call, she let out a\nslight breath. I hope you can pull\nthrough this time. You're just a new\nlord who wants to rely on yourself. My\nfirst prophet is never wrong. You are\nindeed a promising talent. If I survive,\nI will see you in person. The current\ndragon kingdom desperately needs a top\ntier ranger lord, just as the prophet\nforetold. My hunch is always right.\nBrans is here again. Resisting the\ndemonic tide, Lyn Sha inexplicably felt\nhis left eyelid twitch several times in\na row. Then a gigantic one-horned abyss\ndemon shattered the ground outside its\nterritory and slowly rose from the\nflames. Prepare to die. Uh-uh. The abyss\ndemon slowly emerged from the flames.\nBut once he stepped out, he realized he\nhad come to the wrong place. There\nwasn't a single demon around him. They\nwere all iron guards with long swords,\narchers with divine arms, and spearmen\nwith white pole. The abyss demon looked\nup and around. The demonic tide, which\nshould have been locked in a stalemate\nbefore, had now been pushed back so much\nby the battle lines. I was only a few\nminutes late, and the demonic army was\nalready down to 1/3 of its original\nsize. Beside him, tall soldiers clad in\nfull armor, wielding long swords and\nspears, coldly stared at Brans. Brans\nhad fought these soldiers a few times.\nThey were a formidable force he had\nnever seen in the real world. Brans\nestimated that their strength was at\nleast epic. Bran's cold sweat slowly\ntrickled down his back. Hey everyone,\nanyone interested in singing, dancing,\nand rapping together? The iron guards\nwith Mo Dao and the White Spear soldiers\nimmediately made way for them. Brans\nexhaled. Huh, what gullible humans. Then\na sharp pain shot through his body and\nhis entire enormous demonic form flew\nup. A troop of cavalry, swift as\nlightning and charging like arrows,\nslashed him from behind and sent him\nflying. The leader, clad in golden\nhelmet and armor, and a silver white\nwoolen cloak was truly imposing and\nexuded an aura of dominance. Just as the\nabyss demon was about to land, another\ntroop of cavalry blasted him away. and\nthen another team. Five cavalry units\naccelerated to their maximum speed and\ndirectly inflicted severe injuries on\nthe abyss demon. Poor Brans didn't even\nget to say a harsh word before suffering\na crushing defeat. Bran's body is about\nto disintegrate, returning to the demon\nrealm. With his last breath, Bran\nshouted, \"Lynshia, her highness, the\nprincess, asked me to deliver a message\nto you.\" She said, \"She's the only one\nwho can control you. There's no chance\nyou'll sleep with her. The bloodthirsty\nwitch Sherry hiding in her territory\nimmediately perked up her ears. Lyn\nShia, what nonsense are you spouting\nnow? Chapter 105. An unexpected visitor\nencounter. Bran's roar carried far and\nwide. Immediately, his body shattered\ninto fragments and then crumbled into\nashes which were carried away by the\nwind. Lyn Sha shook his head. He knew\nthat this guy might come back. Neither\nLynn Shiao nor the succubus princess\nknew the profound impact that this\nunreliable abyss demon shout would have\non them shortly to come. After Brans was\ndefeated, the already crumbling demon\ntide was quickly wiped out by Hortubing\nand the Guan Ning cavalry. In the\nbeginner area, the monster level cap is\n30. However, as Lyn Xiao's golden\nlegendary troops reach higher and higher\nlevels, and his heroes become more\nnumerous and powerful, even the Sclass\ndemonic tide is becoming less and less\nof a threat. The announcement from the\nmain god system came through. You have\nsuccessfully resisted the S-class\ncalculated. Battle results. Annihilate\nthe following enemies. Abyss demon\nspecial epic one. Nest demon epic 5\nviolent demon excellent 235 fierce demon\nrare 856 bone demon rare 2687 horn demon\nfine battle duration 1 hour 15 minutes\nand 8 seconds our casualties zero\nspecial stacking s level demonic tide\nbattle and the difference between the\nlevels and special epic level boss in\nthe beginner area. Rewards 754,682\nexp,487\ngold, 6,871\nenergy, two epic chests, two superior\nchests, three rare chests. Although the\nlevel three magic tide is almost twice\nas large as the level two magic tide,\nthis time without Chow Chow's spirit\npossession, the 100% bonus is missing.\nSo, the gains can only be considered\nnormal. However, there was at least one\nepic treasure chest left, and Lin Shia\nnodded in satisfaction. This is\nbasically a buy one get two free deal.\nUpgrading to level three gives you a\ngolden legendary chest. And fighting the\ndemonic tide gives you two epic chests.\nMy goal of reaching level three and\ngaining one more hero has also been\nachieved. Theoretically speaking, we can\nrecruit another Chinese hero right now.\nHowever, on the system panel, Lin Shia\ndiscovered that he was currently unable\nto use the hero token. This suggests\nthat the ancient demons may have already\narranged for another hero to be on his\nway to their territory. I wonder who it\nwill be this time. At that moment, Lyn\nXiao's communicator rang. It was\nChufinga. Lyn Shiao immediately hung up\nand sent a message to Chufinga telling\nher to call back a little later because\nright now, Lyn Shia is about to open a\ntreasure chest. First up, the epic\ntreasure chest. Ding! You have obtained\nthe epic weapon, divine might water gun\none. Ding! You have obtained one epic\nquality recruitment token. View\nproperties: Divine might water gun epic\nbase attack power 620, strength + 10,\nconstitution plus 30. Special\nattributes, sharpness, armor penetration\nincreased by 30%, enemy penetration,\ndamage to Japanese heroes, troops, and\nlords increased by 30%. Introduction.\nThe divine might fierce water gun was\nforged by the Chinese hero Chiuan from a\nfew rare and precious materials selected\nfrom countless spoils of war captured\nfrom Japanese pirates. The shaft is 9 ft\nlong with the spear head being 1 ft and\n3 in long and the tip being 3 in long.\nIt is made of fine steel mixed with gold\nand is extremely sharp. What a sharp\nepic weapon. Come to think of it, I now\nhave two epic spears. After Bao's luck\nvalue reached zero, my luck recovered\nsomewhat. Next, let's continue opening\nthe golden legendary chests. Ding! You\nhave obtained the legendary golden\nweapon, demon sword. A pause. Signal\ninterference is in progress. You have\nobtained the legendary golden weapon,\nCrimson Sky Sword. Lyn Sha was slightly\ntaken aback. Could this legendary\ntreasure chest also interfere with\nsignals? Was it the work of an ancient\ndemon again? Cha. Lyn Sha suddenly\nrealized. Isn't this one of the 10 most\nfamous swords in China? Check the\nattributes of the Crimson Sky sword.\nCrimson sky golden legendary poem weapon\nquality legendary lord exclusive\nattributes base attack power 880\nstrength plus 50 spirit plus 50 soul\nplus 50 special attribute concealed edge\nthe crimson sky sword is always\npresented as an iron rod holding this\nsword can conceal one's strength and\nweapon capabilities from the enemy's\ndetection when not drawing the sword\nphysical and magical defense is\nincreased by 50% and one is not afraid\nof mind control magic. Serpent slayer.\nThe crimson sky sword is also known as\nthe serpent slayer sword and it\nincreases damage against any reptile by\n100%. Imperial way increases the\nholder's battlefield luck by 100% and\nslowly increases the holder's national\nluck. Introduction wielding a three-foot\nsword, he achieved unparalleled feats.\nIndeed, a fine sword. The 10 most famous\nswords of China live up to their\nreputation. This is also the first gold\nlegendary weapon I've obtained, and its\nattributes are really strong. With a\ngreat battle imminent, this sword will\nbe like adding wings to a tiger. Since\nit was exclusive to Lords, Lyn Sha\nquickly glanced at Xihao&lt;unk&gt;s\nattributes and skills and then put it\naway. Having obtained a legendary\nweapon, Lyn Sha thought for a moment and\nthen summoned Hortubing and Chin Leonu.\nOne was a handsome man, the other a\nbeautiful woman. One wore a silver\ncloak, the other a red cape. One wore\ngold armor, the other silver armor. Both\nwere dashing and heroic. One person is\nas kind and trustworthy as one's own\nnephew. The other person is like your\nnewlywed sister-in-law or like a high\nschool beauty who just got divorced and\ndoesn't have a child on Earth. In short,\nit's that kind of alluring married woman\nvibe. Strange. Why would I make such an\nassociation? It must be a lingering\neffect of Munga's spirit. This humble\ngeneral pays his respects to the Lord.\nThe two knelt on one knee at the same\ntime, interrupting Lin Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s\nrevery. Suubing, Lyang Yu, I have seen\nyour contributions, and you are both\nextremely loyal to me. Lyn Shiao said\nslowly. Suubing used his original weapon\nwhile Lyang Yu only used a rare long\nspear. That kid Pay Min already has two\nepic swords. I happen to have two epic\nspears on hand, so I'll give them to\nyou, too. Lyn Sha took out his magic\ngun, Brianac, and handed it to Chin\nLeong Yu. He then picked up the newly\nactivated divine might water gun and\nhanded it to Hitsubing. Briona has a\nnegative effect of minus 10 stamina,\nwhile the divine might water gun adds 30\nstamina. How to allocate it is obvious.\nThis humble general thanks you, Lord.\nLin Sha waved his hand and continued\nwithout any formalities. Zubing, Liang\nYu, and Payman follow me to the war\nhall. Soldier Len, Tangg Yi, and Song\nRuer are in charge of battlefield\ncleanup. The three heroes followed Lin\nShiao to the war hall. Upon entering,\neveryone was aruck by the grandeur of\nthe place. But what surprised them most\nwas a simulated sand table in the center\nof the hall. the maps and terrain of the\nreal world at a one colon 1 1000 scale\nbased on the maps explored by the lords.\nFortunately, Lin Shiao had the\nopportunity to use the gods perspective\nwhen creating the sandbox in the warh\nhall. Therefore, the sand table at this\nmoment centered on Lin Xiao's Lord's\nmansion covers an area of tens of\nthousands of square kilm. Not only is\nthere the Calabash mountain range and\nCalabash Valley behind the Lord's\nMansion, which covers nearly 10,000\nsquare kilm, but there are also various\nterrains, special buildings, monster\nlayers, rivers, roads, and other Lord's\nmansions all around. It is accurate to\nthe smallest detail without the\nslightest error. However, the sandbox is\nnot updated in real time. It will only\nupdate automatically when it is updated\nwithin the Lord's field of vision. Even\nso, having this sand table is equivalent\nto having complete control over all the\nterrain. My lord, with this sand table,\nwe will be able to carry out our\nbattles, ambushes, and surprise attacks\nwith ease. Deploying strong troops to\nguard certain strategic locations can\nmake a single man able to hold off\n10,000. Chinyu was an expert in mountain\nwarfare. She couldn't take her eyes off\nthe sand table once she saw it. He leang\nYu. This is also why I gathered everyone\nhere to familiarize ourselves with the\nterrain. In less than 2 days, the black\nflame will descend. We need to fully\ndiscuss his tactics and prepare for the\nworst. For the next 2 days, we'll grind\nmonsters and gain experience during the\nday and come here at night to discuss\nand analyze military situations. By the\nway, I'll involve Ba as well. Her\nabilities shouldn't limit her to just\nbeing a concubine. Lyn Shao silently\ncalled out in his heart, and a moment\nlater, a woman wearing a scarlet cloak\narrived at the war hall. She lowered her\nhood, revealing a face that was\nbreathtakingly beautiful, both ethereal\nand alluring. Her long black hair\ncascaded down her back. Her face was\nfair and flawless, as if sculpted from\nice crystal. Her nose was soft yet\nstraight. Her lips were full and red,\nand when she blinked, her thick,\ninterlaced eyelashes were like a brush.\nThe other three heroes, regardless of\ngender, were also deeply moved when they\nsaw this stunningly beautiful woman. My\nlord, my generals. Ba knelt down and\nbowed to the crowd. Ba, you've come at\nthe right time. Let's discuss military\nmatters together. Lyn Shiao led everyone\nto the sand table, placed his hands on\nthe edge of the sand table, and stared\nintently at the complex terrain in front\nof him. At that moment, Lyn Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s\ncommunication channel rang. Without\nlooking up, he answered it directly.\n\"Fongu, what do you want with me?\" After\na few seconds of silence, Lyn Shao\nlooked up in surprise and saw a face as\ncold and aloof as a painting. Lyn Sha,\nis this your reward? The beautiful\nheroine. Chapter 106. Special hero. O Y\nYe Yzi. The expedition arrives. Lynsha.\nIs this your reward? The beautiful\nheroine. A cool and elegant voice came\nfrom behind him. And Lyn Sha smiled. Dug\nJalon. It's so nice to hear your voice.\nMy old squad leader finally had time to\nvisit me. That was Dug Jon. In the\nvideo, she wears a light purple robe\nwith a sword at her waist, looking\nethereal and otherworldly, standing\nproudly like a fairy descended to earth,\nmaking it impossible to look directly at\nher. A purple robe fluttered in the\nwind, long hair cascaded down. The\npurple dress was like a flower, and the\nlong sword was whiter than snow. She\npossessed indescribable beauty,\nelegance, and noble refinement. Her fair\nface was charming yet aloof. Her\nbeautiful eyes clear as water. Her thin\nlips were lightly pursed, pink and\nglistening. And her every move exuded a\ncool elegance. Perhaps I came at the\nwrong time. It seems I've uncovered\nquite a few of your secrets. Dugu\nJaolon&lt;unk&gt;s gaze swept over Lin Xiao's\nfour heroes, lingering particularly on\nBao Sea for several seconds before\nturning to the sand table in front of\nLin Shao. Dugu Jaolon always spoke in a\ncalm and indifferent manner which Lyn\nSha greatly envied because subtle is the\nbest tool for a lord to enhance his\nprestige. No, you are always welcome.\nDugu Lyn Sha shrugged and said, I trust\nDugu. There are no secrets between Dugu\nand me. No secrets? Yes, just like Fong\nGoo and I. We understand each other\nwithout saying a word. Those who\nunderstand understand. The two stared at\neach other silently for a few seconds\nacross the screen. The atmosphere tense.\nThen the two of them burst into laughter\nat the same time. Huh? He after a few\nseconds of synchronized laughter, Lyn\nSha spoke. Speaking of which, what\nbrings you here, Dugu? I have found more\ninformation about the celestial beings\norganization, and I am providing it to\nyou. Dugu Jaolon&lt;unk&gt;s smile faded, and\nhe said. Chufunga refused to answer my\ncalls, but only sent me your number. So\nI came to find you. Lynn Sha was deeply\nmoved. It turned out that Dugu Xaolan\nhad taken the initiative to seek him out\nbecause of this matter. Thank you, squad\nleader. Lyn Shia deliberately included\nthe word old to show respect. Um Dugu\nJaolan spoke with a nasal tone. Thank\nyou, Dugu. Lyn Shia made a joke that\nwasn't too big or too small and took the\nfile that Doo Jaon was sending him.\nAlthough you have won against me again,\nthis time you will soon face the black\nflames attack. Dugu Jaolon said\nsolemnly. Don't be careless. This enemy\nmight be stronger than before for some\nspecial reason. In short, be fully\nprepared. According to my intelligence,\nChufunga, Joli, Wong Bo, and Pans Shan\nYu are all from the city lord's mansion.\nThey will do their best to protect you\nthis time and are your allies. In\naddition, I also learned something about\nDing Lays relationship with the\nCelestial Beings organization. The\nremaining information is all about the\nmilitary units of the Celestial Beings\norganization. I believe you can\nunderstand it. Mm. Lin Sha nodded.\nThanks. After a pause, Dugu Jaolon\nslowly continued. Take good care of\nyourself. I really want to see you in\nthe official area. Take care of\nyourself. I still really want to see me.\nLyn Shao suddenly opened his eyes wide.\nUm, let's have another showdown. Dugu\nJaolan finished writing all the words\nexpressionlessly, then hung up the call.\nReally, to be mischievous? Even the\nusually aloof Dugu can be cheeky. Lyn\nSha shook his head, but then he saw Baoi\nsecretly watching him with a half smile.\nHey, it's not what you think, Ba. I'm\nnot Daniel Wu, loved by everyone. All\nright, let's take a look at the latest\nintelligence and then discuss and\nsimulate the military situation. All the\nheroes understood the urgency of the\nsituation. So they put away their jokes\nand started discussing it with Lin Shiao\nPay Min who were present were all\ngenerals with a profound understanding\nof warfare. As they discussed the latest\nintelligence sent by Dugu Jaolon, they\ncame up with many good ideas.\nUnfortunately, no matter how you discuss\nit, Lyn Shao still has one major\nweakness. Insufficient manpower. On the\nday of the decisive battle, Lyn Shao\nonly had 50 emo dao soldiers, 50 divine\narm archers, 50 white pole soldiers, 50\nGuan Ning iron cavalry, 49 phantom\narchers, and 130 flower fairies. But\nconsidering the flower fair's combat\nstrength, it was best not to have too\nhigh expectations. Besides that, Lin Sha\nonly has seven recruitment tokens, which\ncan recruit 70 soldiers, two epic\nrecruitment tokens, and five other\nquality tokens. But the enemy is likely\nto be 1,000 fully equipped level 30\nunits. Based on the information provided\nby Duga Jaolon, the quality is estimated\nto be quite high. Moreover, according to\nthe latest intelligence, it seems that\nthe celestial beings also developed an\nunknown number of bloodthirsty lords.\nThere's no way to get more recruitment\ntokens now. Lynn Sha shook his head.\nAlthough he was certain he would receive\na recruitment token if he sought help\nfrom Chu Yusi, Lyn Sha was unwilling.\nThen the only option is to improve the\ncapabilities of different troop types\nwhile maintaining the same troop\nstrength. But apart from the phantom\narchers, all of Lord's troops are of\nlegendary gold quality. How can they be\nupgraded? Quitsubing asked. There is\nstill a way. Lyn Sha looked at the task\nlist in the war hall and his own\nblacksmith shop. There there are upgrade\nquests for the Mod Dao soldiers to\nimprove their armor and upgrade quests\nfor all troop types to improve their\nequipment. As long as the equipment of\nthe legendary gold tier units is\nupgraded to the next level. Just then,\nSoldering's voice came from outside the\nwarh hall. My lord, a man outside the\nterritory claiming to be O Y Ye Yzi\nrequests an audience saying he is your\npersonal hero. O Yi Lin Sha was taken\naback. Then his eyes lit up. My fifth\nhero is O Y Ye Yzi. It's like a pillow\nappearing just when you're sleepy. Come,\nlet's go and welcome O Y Yezi together.\nOutside the territory, an elderly man\nwith white hair but vigorous spirit\nstood quietly at the door. Lynn Sha led\nseveral heroes out and his hearty\nlaughter echoed from afar. So it's\nMaster O Y Ye Yzi. Please forgive Lyn\nSha for being late and welcoming you.\nWhen O Yi saw that the Lord did not send\nsomeone to lead him inside, but instead\ncame out personally to greet him. He was\nquite surprised. He quickly took a few\nsteps forward and knelt down on the\nground. This humble subject, oh Yzi,\npays his respects to your lordship.\nMaster, please rise. Lyn Sha has been\nwaiting for you for a long time. Lyn Sha\nhas always been generous in showing\nrespect to talented people and his\nsincere attitude caused O Y's loyalty to\nsoar to 90. Check O Y Ye Yzi's\nattributes. O Y Ye Yzi race human\nChinese. Quality golden legend special\nhero level one. Description: Blacksmith\nMaster Type Special Hero. No combat\nability. Can train blacksmiths while\nrunning the blacksmith shop. Unlocks the\nforging of any standard weapon type of\ngold legendary. Requires resources.\nUnlocks any upgrade item below gold\nlegendary level with reduced upgrade\nresource requirements by 50% and\nincreases upgrade speed by 100%.\nObtaining a special golden legendary\nhero solved Lin Xiao's predicament of\nnot having a blacksmith. Moreover, you\ncan now use O Y Yezi to upgrade the\nequipment of your troops. Lyn Sha was\noverjoyed and pulled O Y Ye Yzi into the\nterritory where he treated him well.\nAfter making the arrangements, Lyn Sha\nled the five heroes into the war hall to\ndiscuss future strategies. Two days\npassed in the blink of an eye. That day,\nthe system issued a regionwide\nannouncement. Ding. Black flame, a\nplayer from the LN region, has broken\nthrough the region and descended upon\nthe 89757\nnewbie zone. Target Lynsha. Due to\nrestrictions imposed during the conquest\nevent, the 89,757\nbeginner zone is locked and no player\ncan enter the official zone. The lock\nwill be lifted once the 3-day conquest\nperiod ends or either black flame or Lin\nSha is defeated. Above the beginner\narea, the light barrier shattered and a\nlarge number of people suddenly appeared\nat the sight of the former Lord Gene\nDashangs mansion. A man of medium build\nwith small eyes, thin lips, and a scar\non his face stood in front of the lord's\nmansion giving a cold smile. Black\nflames message in the chat channel. Lyn\nShia, I'm here. Just wait to die. Now\nyou'll all see the consequences of\nangering the celestial beings. Chapter\n107. Ants in the newbie zone. Black\nflame is coming. Announce your arrival\ndirectly to all the newbies in the chat\nchannel. Ever since Lynn Shia turned the\ntide and regained first place in the\nthree-year college entrance exam, the\nchat channel, which had been quiet for a\nlong time, immediately exploded. It's\nover. Lyn Sha is finished. Black Flame\nis really here. How could a lord from\nthe newbie zone possibly defeat a lord\nfrom the official zone? No wonder Lin\nShia didn't immediately go to the main\narea to hide after completing the third\nbook. It turns out he was locked out of\nthe area. Idiot. The god system has\nalready patched such a simple loophole\nthat allows you to enter the official\nzone by upgrading to level three.\nOtherwise, what's the use of the descent\ntalisman? Now we can only wait quietly\nfor a few days until one side is killed\nand the game ends before it unlocks.\nWe're still waiting for one of them.\nIsn't that Lynn Shia? It's a pity that\nit delayed my entry into the official\nzone. you. There are only three\nor four people in the entire Lon newbie\nzone who have successfully completed\nlevel 3. When will it be your turn?\nSpeaking of Lyn Sha, why isn't he coming\nout to answer? Is he scared by the black\nflames? Yeah, since we're going to die\nanyway, we might as well say something\ntough. Will this work? That way you can\ndie with some dignity. Everyone, sigh,\nif you ask me, Lyn Sha shouldn't have\nprovoked Gene Dang in the first place.\nEven after Gene Dang brought in\nreinforcements, we should have given him\nface and let him go. If that were the\ncase, this situation wouldn't have\nhappened. Seriously, he got himself into\ntrouble by showing off too much. Can't\nyou fight back if someone hits you on\nthe head? Look at the power of Gene\nDuchang isn't resisting just certain\ndeath. What a pity. The power ceiling of\nour 89,757\nnewbie zone has fallen. In the chat\nchannel, everyone expressed their regret\nto varying degrees, but no one dared to\nsay that Lyn Sha was a good for nothing\nanymore. Lyn Shia is usually low-key,\nbut what he does is anything but. In the\nbeginner zone, players can only upgrade\nto level three. In the three upgrade\ncompetitions, Lin Sha won first place\ntwice. On the second day after the\nserver opened, two bloodthirsty lords\nwere killed without a word. Dinglay,\nwhom even the three top players in the\nother beginner area couldn't defeat\ntogether, was taken down by Lin Shia\nwith just one hero. Smash the abyss\ndemon with one hand, turning the tide\nwhen the second tier universities were\nat a disadvantage. Every time someone\nthinks Lynn Shia is no good, he jumps\nout and proves them wrong. Now, no one\ndares to doubt his strength in the\nnewbie zone. However, no one believed\nthat someone with F-level talent could\nturn the tide again and defeat a player\nwho had just arrived from the official\nzone, even if he has many secrets. After\nall, the success rate of defeating\nnovice lords in the official server over\nthe years has been 99.99%.\nAnd no one believed that Lynn Shiao was\none in 10,000. The win rate in the\nofficial server is almost 100% when\nplaying against the newbie server. So\nwhy is it that most lords in the newbie\nserver can still smoothly enter the\nofficial server as long as they survive?\nBecause the cost of breaking through a\nnew server is too high. Generally, only\na few people each year would risk the\nenormous price of a formal server lord\nto hunt down a new lord. When everyone\nelse was playing dumb, you were the only\none who stood out. And now you're\nreaping what you sowed. I've disliked\nthat kid, Lyn Sha, for a long time. A\nmoment of patience brings calm and\ntranquility. This old saying, whose\norigin is unknown, still holds some\ntruth. Sigh. This time, Black Flame is\nonly targeting Lyn Sha. We as mere\nbystanders should just watch quietly\nfrom the sidelines without making a\nsound and naturally we won't be\naccidentally hurt when people sighed\nridiculed or mocked. Black flame spoke\nagain. Lyn Sha, enough with the\nnonsense. You have offended the dignity\nof the celestial beings. You deserve to\ndie. Not only will you die, but those\nvassal lords who have come to you will\nalso die. Your best friend is going to\ndie. Your lover is going to die, too.\nEveryone connected to you must die. Your\nheroes and troops will all be wiped out\nby us. The slaughter begins now.\nEveryone was stunned. Someone jumped out\nand asked timidly. Black flame boss,\nisn't this a bit too harsh? Just punish\nthe ring leaders. Isn't that enough?\nHaving connections with Lyn Shia? There\nare far too many. I've even bought items\nthat Lyn Sha listed for auction. Yeah,\nBlack Flame boss. Shut up. Black Flame\ninterrupted. It's none of your business\nto tell the heavenly beings what to do.\nYou ants and scum from the newbie zone\ndon't even have the right to speak to\nme. You are only fit to be fertilizer\nfor the blood lord and human ships in\nthe killing contest. The sudden insult\nstunned everyone in the newbie zone.\nThis is blatant contempt and\nhumiliation, but the newbies were\nhelpless and didn't even dare to talk\nback because Lynn Shia, who dared to\nignore the threat, was a cautionary\ntale. Also, what is this killing contest\nall about? What is the blood lord all\nabout? Just then, a discordant voice\nappeared. He's a black flame. I think\nyou're the real fertilizer and scum of\nthe official zone. Tan by Chen. Oh, what\na show of power. Coming to our newbie\nzone to show off. Did you get bullied by\nother experts in the regular zone? Maybe\nin the official area, we'll have to lick\nother people's stinky feet. I heard that\nthe one who threatened boss Lin Sha was\na masked man, but it was you who came\ndown. Aren't you just someone else's\nlittle brother? What are you so smug\nabout? My little sister is only slightly\npretty, and I can't even stand looking\nat her. At this moment, although the\nother novice lords still dared not\nspeak, they were secretly pleased.\nFinally, someone dared to stand up and\nvent their anger. Take another look, and\nit's Heay and the pretty girl. Aren't\nthese two vassal lords of Lyn Shao?\nEveryone remained silent. Although they\ndared not be like Lin Shiao, they did\nindeed feel a little envious of him.\nBlack Flame sneered. Good. He and Tu\nShan by Chian, right? I know you too.\nYour Liao&lt;unk&gt;s lackey. No matter how\neloquent you are, today is your death\nday. He was not afraid at all. You won't\nlet me off the hook even if I say nice\nthings. So, I'll deliberately say things\nyou don't like. Come and hit me if you\ndare. Tu Shan by Chin also said, \"Our\nterritory is near boss Lin Xiao's\nterritory, so you can take it all at\nonce. Come on over if you dare.\" A poor\nattempt at provocation. Black Flame\ncontinued to sneer. \"So, you just want\nto lure me into your ambush and launch a\nsurprise attack. Ridiculous. A lion\nwould fear a hair's trap.\" Black Flame\nsaid, \"Today, I will show you what it\nmeans to be utterly ineffective in the\nface of absolute power. Dinglay go.\" The\nwords fell. Ding. Player Ding Lelay has\ncreated a live stream room. Ding.\nContestant Xiao Lelay has created a live\nstream room. Fight. Several people\ncreated live streaming rooms at the same\ntime. In the live broadcast room,\nbanners fluttered and soldiers were\neverywhere. Behind Ding lay alone, there\nwere dozens of lords leading more than a\nthousand troops. Orc veterans, human\ncrossbowmen, lizard riders, all rare\nunit types, plus many exceptional units.\nLooking at other live streams, there's a\nminimum of 1,000 people in each one.\nFour live stream rooms, and more than\n5,000 soldiers suddenly appeared. They\nwere all fully armed and arrogant.\n\"These ants in the newbie zone are all\nperipheral members under the observation\nof my celestial being organization,\"\nBlack Flame said coldly. Let me tell you\na secret. They are all bloodthirsty\nlords and each of them has the lives of\nother lords on their hands. These\nbloodthirsty lords and their troops\nalone are enough to wipe out the rest of\nyour lords. So I can kill whoever I want\nwithout needing to reason with anyone.\nIf you don't want to die, stay away.\nHuh? But hiding doesn't guarantee\nsurvival. After all, the area is locked\nfor 3 days. After killing Lynn Shiao, I\nmight not be able to control my restless\nlords. Be careful. Many people will die.\nBlame Lynn Shiao. This live stream will\nbe visible not only to the 89757\nnewbie zone, but to the entire Lon\nregion. Let's use the blood of Lin Sha\nand everyone connected to him. The blood\nof your 89757\nnewbie zone to make everyone remember.\nFrom now on, the reputation of the\ncelestial beings organization will\nresound throughout the entire dragon's\nsummer domain. He I'll gladly accept\nyour flower fairy. It'll be a good\nopportunity to taste the different\nflavors of creatures. Should it be deep\nfried or steamed? Tan, I've heard you're\nquite beautiful. I hope you won't\ndisappoint me when you're beneath me\nlater. Chapter 108. The war begins.\nAmbush probing. The chat channel was\ncompletely silent. Black Flame had just\nappeared and hadn't even shown its\nforces yet. Just by pulling out the\nbackup troops for development, there are\nseveral thousand soldiers. Dozens of\nlords have already surrounded Lin Xiao's\nCalabash Mountain Range. They started\nseveral live streams at the same time to\ndemonstrate their power. The threat from\nthe Black Flames was still ringing in my\nears. No one dared to speak up and\nadvise Black Flame in the chat channel\nanymore. Instead, they silently entered\nthe live stream room, watching the\npowerful army and talking in hush tones.\nHoly crap, Black Flame and the others\nare serious. How come there are so many\nbloodthirsty lords in our district? How\nmany classmates have been silently\nmurdered? At that time, I thought the\ndifficulty had increased this year and\nthe death rate for newbie lords had\nrisen again. These bloodthirsty lords\nhave rare troops as their base and many\nof them are also excellent troops. I\nreally don't know how Lin Sha will\nresist these thousands of troops. And\nthere's also Boss Dinglay. Boss Ding Lay\nis actually in Black Flames gang. Boss\nDingle is with more than a dozen\nbloodthirsty lords. With Ding Lay\njoining the team, Lin Sha has even less\nof a chance. Who doesn't know that Ding\nLay as fighting ability is second only\nto Lin Sha? Wait. Oh no. We've been\nscammed. Dinglay supposed to be a killer\nof bloodthirsty lords. How come he's\nhanging out with them now? Some people\nin the live stream started to get\nemotional. Dingle, I thought you were on\nthe side of us, the weak and vulnerable\nlords. I never expected you to turn\naround and side with the blood lord. You\nowe us an explanation. Dingle, what's\nwrong with you? I used to be a fan of\nyours, cheering you on. The tall figure\nstanding silently on the hillside also\nsaw the doubts in the live broadcast\nroom. He simply pursed his lips, stared\nstraight ahead, and remained silent.\nBehind Dinglay, a fat man with a face\nfull of scars couldn't stand it anymore.\nWho the hell is making that noise? In\nthe live stream, the lords, who were\nindignant, immediately confronted the\nfat man. The fat man glanced at the live\nstream and happened to see a lord whose\nID was not hidden. He sneered and\nsummoned a hero. Go kill this guy.\nDinglay was shocked to hear this. He\nimmediately turned around and tried to\ngrab the fat man, but saw that the fat\nman shadow fiend hero had vanished in an\ninstant. Make him stop. Ding. Player\nShia Jun from the 89757\nnewbie zone has been eliminated. The\nshadow fiend hero returned shortly\nafterward, his hands covered in blood.\nThe fat man shoved Ding Lay hard,\nignoring Ding Lay's fierce glare, and\ngave a cold laugh at the live stream\ncamera before falling silent. The live\nstream room seemed to fall into a\ndeathly silence. Dinglay took a deep\nbreath and drew his long sword. Attack!\nUnder the watchful eyes of hundreds of\nthousands of spectators, dozens of lords\nled thousands of soldiers in a siege\nagainst Lin Shiao. Oh my god, that was\nterrifying. Yao Yao run. Eay also\nentered the live stream room. He\nswitched between several live stream\nrooms, confirming that none of them were\nplaces he could afford to offend. He\nquickly determined the direction of the\nenemy's attack from the screen,\nimmediately signaled to Tu Shawn by\nChen, and ran away. If you hadn't been\nso arrogant and started broadcasting\nlive, I wouldn't have known that more\nthan a thousand soldiers were already\nnear me. He led 200 flower fairies and\nfled, arriving at the designated\nlocation in no time. Large breasted\nLolita wearing animal ears, a white\nLolita dress, and white stockings is\nriding on a centaur warrior waiting for\nhim. He's a How come Black Flame has so\nmany soldiers? There's no way we can\nfight them. The attractive girl\ncomplained. We originally wanted to lure\na small group of soldiers into an ambush\nto relieve some pressure on boss Lin\nSha. Now that's bad. Any random squad\nhas over a thousand soldiers. The 300\nsoldiers we painstakingly gathered\naren't even enough to fill a tooth gap.\nHow are we supposed to fight? He\nhurriedly said, \"Boss Lin Shia didn't\ninvolve us in this campaign. It was all\npart of our own plan.\" Boss Lin Sha sent\na message. He suddenly realized, \"What\ndid you say? The boss told us to run.\"\n\"No, we have to help our boss.\" Tu Shan\nby Chin protested. Boss Lin Sha has\nsaved us several times. How can we cower\nin such a critical moment? That saved\nyou several times, didn't it? He\nwhispered. In short, we still have 300\ntroops, all of them elite and rare.\nCombined with our special talents, we\ncan hold our own against them. Tu Shan\nby Chin said righteously, \"Being able to\ndeplete the enemy's forces and kill a\nfew bloodthirsty lords is also a\ncontribution to our leader. My goodness,\naren't you supposed to be a master of\nstrategy? Hay shouted. With such a\ndisadvantage in troop strength, do you\nstill want to be a micromanagement\nmaster? No, we absolutely have to help\nboss Lyn Sha. I'm not going. Run away.\nAs the two struggled, a chilling,\nagonizing laugh drifted from afar. Stop\narguing and stop running away. A hideous\ndeformed monster emerged from the\nshadows. Anyway, you can't escape.\nImmediately, more shadowy monsters\nemerged. There are nearly 200. Tuchan by\nChin and Heay's expressions changed\ndrastically. It's a vengeful spirit, a\nsuperior level creature, a natural-born\nlurker and assassin. RT. Meanwhile,\nDingle led dozens of lords and over a\nthousand soldiers directly to the flank\nof the Calabash Mountains. Everyone\nremember this. Our mission is to block\nthe entrance to the Calabash Mountain\nRange and trap Lin Shiao like a turtle\nin a jar. Someone will naturally deal\nwith Lin Xiao's vassel lords. Some\npeople also went to deal with Julie and\nhis group, Shufunga and his group, and\nLin Shiao himself. The Black Flame Lord\nwill personally oversee the operation,\nmaking it virtually foolproof. Do as\nlittle as possible in other matters.\nAvoid creating unnecessary\ncomplications. As soon as Ding Lay\nfinished speaking, the burly man behind\nhim let out a disdainful sneer. Hey, our\nDing Lay, even after his epic weapon was\nstolen, he's still so impressive. Do you\nknow why you were sent to block the\nentrance? It's because you're a loser.\nDinglay suddenly turned around, his\ndesire to kill someone no longer\nconcealed. The burly fat man was\nfearless and responded to Ding Lay with\na look of disdain. Sitting in the Lord's\nmanor, eating the valley specialties\nhanded to him by Baoi, Lyn Sha saw this\nscene in the live broadcast room, and\ncouldn't help but narrow his eyes with\namusement. Run. Uh, as the last vengeful\nspirit was cut down by the centur\nchieftain, these spirits, who had\nthought themselves hunters, all died as\nprey with nowhere to be buried. Phew. I\nhave to say the elite troops are really\nstrong. Tan by Chin said, hands on her\nhips. My little sister almost got\nherself into trouble. Fortunately, we've\ndealt with 200 exceptional unit vengeful\nspirits, which is a good start, he said\nhappily. Pretending to have only 300\ntroops, we actually have 600 plus a near\nepic level centur chieftain in the\nnewbie zone. Defeating 200 wraiths is a\npiece of cake. Knowing that our strength\nwouldn't attract the main force of Black\nFlame, we targeted the outskirts and\ncorners of Black Flame from the start.\nPretend we're arguing and deliberately\nlure out the scouts sent out by the\nBlack Flame faction to attack us. Girl,\nyou really are a big- breasted and smart\ngirl. Too Shawn by Chin smiled\nsheepishly. He I don't know how Brother\nChufinga suddenly found me and gave us\nso many recruitment tokens to support us\nand told us to keep it a secret. I have\nto help the boss, but I also have to\nkeep it from him. That's the only way.\nWe'll use the same trick again later to\nlure Black Flame's reconnaissance units\ninto our trap. Kill as many as you can,\neven blinding Black Flame is good. Good.\nChapter 109. The consequences of\nangering a powerful force. In another\nlive stream, a massive bloodthirsty Lord\narmy with 3,000 troops marched ahead of\nDing Lays forces, pushing forward in a\nmighty imposing manner. They had passed\nthrough the deserted territory of Tu\nShan by Chin and Heay and effortlessly\ndestroyed everything in the territory.\nThe Lord's manor, the spirit fields, the\nhouses, the warehouses, the tavern,\neverything was destroyed in an instant.\nHe and Tu Shan by Chian had already led\nall the troops and farmers to evacuate,\nbut the losses to their territory were\nreal. After this battle, they would\nprobably find it difficult to recover.\nThis is what happens when you become Lin\nXiao's lackey. The Bloodlords party\nannounced loudly, then continued on its\nway. Following their marching route,\ntheir next destinations would be the\nterritories of the Jolie, Wong Bo, and\nPanch Shan Yu. Then we can advance\ndirectly to Hulu Pass. Their team is the\nmain force of this blood lord battle.\nDingle is merely a reserve player and a\nscapegoat. Xiaoi Lei, who was in charge,\nhad a faint, cold smile on his lips the\nwhole time. He was not at all surprised\nby the sudden appearance of the three\njulie people in front of him. These are\nthe three so-called geniuses who were\ndefeated by Ding Lay alone. Xiao IL\nsneered. No matter how strong your\nindividual abilities are, you think your\n600 soldiers combined can fight against\nour 3,000. A genius is about to fall.\nThe three members of Julie exchanged\nglances, said nothing, and with a wave\nof their hands led their heroes and\ntroops forward. Xiao snorted coldly, and\ncharged forward with the Lord behind\nhim, engaging in a fierce battle with\nthe three members of Julie. The largest\ndirect battle in the newbie zone to date\nhas now broken out. Countless viewers\nheld their breath, staying in the live\nstream room without daring to blink.\nMeanwhile, another group of bloodthirsty\nlords arrived in a grand procession from\nthe flank at the foot of the outer edge\nof the Calabash Mountains. As seen in\nthe live stream, most of these more than\na thousand units are lightly armed. And\nthere are also some flying units.\nHarpies, gargoyless can fly. Executioner\nis a mountain savage skilled in mountain\nwarfare. The viewers of the live stream\nroughly understood the team's plan. And\nwhile they were speculating, several\nsinister and bloodthirsty lords led\nthese fastmoving troops to the foot of\nthe mountain. At their command, all the\ninfantry began to climb the ridge.\nFlying units then took the lead to scout\nahead and reconoider. Finally, someone\nin the live stream couldn't help but\nspeak up. This is it. Their team is\nplanning to infiltrate through the\nCalabash vein and disrupt Lin Xiao's\nrear. This is not just about disrupting\nthe rear. It's about launching a\nsurprise attack on Lin Xiao's territory\nfrom the rear, leaving him unable to\ndefend himself on both ends. Another\nperson added, \"This is a blatant sneak\nattack. Koko is live streaming herself\nswaggering over mountains and valleys to\nlaunch a sneak attack. That's just too\nunbelievable. How unbelievable.\" Lyn\nShiao is just one person with at most a\nfew vassel lords. How many soldiers\ncould he possibly have? Several thousand\ntroops launch a frontal attack. Over a\nthousand reserveists block the way. And\nover a thousand flank and launch a\nsurprise attack. Even if he understands\nthis, so what? Can he spare troops to\ndeal with it? If he were watching the\nlive stream, he might have already\npanicked by now. This is psychological\nwarfare, this person analyzed. Moreover,\nmost importantly, the main force of this\nexpedition, Black Flame, has not yet\nrevealed its unit type, and it hasn't\npersonally taken action yet. H! Everyone\ngasped in astonishment. How could such a\nlowly henchman possess such power? Is\nthe celestial beings organization truly\ninvincible? Lyn Sha hasn't shown his\nface since Black Flame appeared. Has he\ngiven up resisting? It seems Lyn Shao is\nreally finished this time. He hold the\neast flank. Tan by Chian s delicate\nshout came from behind. All centaur\nwarriors charge with me one more time.\nAfter saying that, Tu Shan by Chin\nmounted the centaur chieftain and\ncharged forward again without\nhesitation. Just a few minutes later,\nTan by Chin returned looking disheveled.\nGirl, all right, let's retreat. You did\na great job. He also led the remaining\nhalf of the flower fairy legion back.\nWith these 600 troops, we have already\neliminated more than 500 enemy\nreconnaissance troops. If we continue\nfighting, we will be completely wiped\nout. The troops that come are getting\nstronger with each attack. We can't keep\nup with them. Tu Shan by Chian pondered\nfor a few seconds, then nodded\nemphatically. All right, retreat\nimmediately. The two men leading the\nremaining soldiers quickly retreated\nthrough the pre-arranged secret passage.\nHowever, after running only a few\nhundred meters, a dense swarm of enemies\nappeared in front of the secret passage.\nWhat? Tu Shan by Chian was about to\nescape with Heay through another path\nwhen they encountered the enemy again.\nThe pursuers behind them caught up at a\nleisurely pace. They're surrounded layer\nupon layer totaling several hundred\nsoldiers. They cornered Heay and Tu\nShawn by Chin in a dead end with no way\nto escape. Now the two have less than\n300 soldiers. He he pretty girl,\nweak-willed guy, didn't you two have a\ngood time just now? A cold laugh came\nfrom a blonde man with tattoos on his\nneck. Keep fighting. You think it's so\ngreat that you killed over 500 of our\nscouts. The blond-haired man first\nslowly instructed his subordinates to\nstart a live stream. He walked out with\na butterfly knife dangling from his\nhand, wearing ripped jeans and a\nnonchalant air. Several bloodthirsty\nlords followed behind him. We\ndeliberately waited until now to start\nour live stream just to capture you two\nalive. Did you really think those scouts\ndied in vain? You are killing them and\nwe are also pinpointing your location.\nNow surrender obediently. You, the weak\nkidney man, will be strangled to death\nby boss black flame. But you, the pretty\ngirl, can have some fun before you die.\nTu Shan by Chian angrily replied. Don't\neven think about it. Heay murmured. When\ndid I become a man with kidney\ndeficiency? Everyone glanced at Heay's\ndeep dark circles, but no one spoke.\nHey, that's Smokey eye makeup. Superior.\nWith a wave of his hand, the\nblond-haired man ordered all the\nsoldiers to swarm forward. He and Tu\nShan by Chin could only grit their teeth\nand fight the remaining troops against\nHuang Mao. However, their troops were\ninferior in both quality and number to\nthese bloodthirsty lords. So, their\ndefeat and capture were only a matter of\ntime. In the live stream, someone sighed\nsoftly. This is the price of angering a\npowerful force. Over there, it's 3,000\nagainst 600. The main force is almost\nannihilating the Julie forces here. It's\n600 against 300, and the fate of the\npretty girl will soon be revealed. More\nthan a thousand people have already\nreached the top of the mountain and will\nsoon enter the interior of the Holian\nMountains. Dinglay still has more than a\nthousand reserve players. Black Flame,\nhe hasn't made a move yet. This person's\nwords resonated with everyone. Regret,\nridicule, disdain, and pity filled the\nlive stream and chat channels. After\nthis battle alone, I doubt anyone will\ndare to offend a major power again.\nSomeone summarized it as follows.\nJoining major organizations to save your\nlife is the only way for a novice lord\nto survive. The ruthless and merciless\nlord like Lynn Shiao has ultimately\nbecome a legend. At that moment, a\nsudden change occurred. Chapter 1. Epic\nunits debut. Lyn Shia makes his move. On\nthe chaotic battlefield, Xiao Ela stood\nquietly on the outside as if the\nsoldiers fighting bloody battles had\nnothing to do with him. As one of the\nstrongest lords in the outer\norganization of the celestial beings\nbesides Ding Lelay, he is only level 12\nso far. The opposing Jolie, Wong Bo, and\nPanch Shan Yu. Xiao Lelay estimated that\nthey had reached level 15. Similarly,\nthe level of their own troops is also\nlagging behind the troops led by these\nthree top players, but victory had\ninevitably tilted in their favor because\nof an overwhelming numerical advantage.\nPans Shanu&lt;unk&gt;s hero, Spider Prince\nNicholas, used a shadow explosion to\nkill a Blood Lord hero, but he was\nimmediately attacked by several other\nheroes and died in less than half a\nminute. Wong Bo, a member of the Julie\ntribe, personally went to the\nbattlefield and killed several soldiers,\ndemonstrating his powerful personal\ncombat ability and living up to his\nreputation as a genius. However, he was\nalso covered in wounds. Of the main\nforce they brought, less than 300\nremained. If it weren't for the fact\nthat the nine Lee still had 10 powerful,\nepic quality units, head hunters,\nholding the fort, they would have been\ndefeated long ago. Xiaoi Lay sneered\ndisdainfully at the live stream\naudience. Everyone, the game is over.\nAfter saying that, he commanded the\nreserve troops around him to prepare to\nenter the battlefield, wanting to make a\ndecisive move. So-called geniuses are\nnothing more than this. The forces\nbehind you haven't even given you the\nsupport you deserve. If that's the case,\nwhy not just die? With your heads on my\nhands, I'm guaranteed a place in the\ncelestial beings organization. No sooner\nhad the words left his mouth than a loud\nshout came from afar. Who says there's\nno support? A red-haired lord led\nseveral hundred soldiers in a charge.\nXiaoi&lt;unk&gt;s eyes turned cold. Who are\nyou? Tell me my name and I'll give you a\nfright. I am Chufinga. You are Chufinga.\nXiaoi Lelay was taken aback, then burst\ninto laughter. I was looking for you,\nbut you've really delivered yourself to\nmy doorstep. Julie, Wongbo, Little\nCutie, Project 2. Chu Funga shouted, and\nhundreds of soldiers charged straight\ninto the blood lord's army. A few\nhundred soldiers, and they're already\nthis arrogant. Do they think they're\nGod? Xiaoi Lelay was muttering to\nhimself when suddenly his eyes narrowed.\nChufinga's hundreds of soldiers charged\ninto the enemy ranks, unstoppable and\nunstoppable. Upon closer inspection, it\nturned out that this group of soldiers\nwere all elite berserkers, and it seems\nthey've already reached around level 20.\nBerserkers are the elite of the elite\nunits. The 500 strong Berserker Legion,\nfacing the Bloodlord's army, composed\nprimarily of rare units and supplemented\nby superior ones, unleashed formidable\ncombat power. They were fearless. Their\nmovements were synchronized and none\ncould stop them. Xiao didn't have time\nto think much and immediately led his\nreserve team to join the battle. Just\nthen, the ground collapsed and a hole\nappeared on the other side of the\nbattlefield from which hundreds more\nberserkers crawled out. The group of\ndozens of men leading the group were\ntall and burly with tattoos on their\nfaces, wearing black cloaks and\nbare-chested with huge beast teeth\naround their necks. They were actually\nepic quality berserkers. Panther\nberserkers. They were the ones who dug\nthe tunnel and led the soldiers to hide\nhere. The panther berserker leading\nseveral hundred elite berserkers plunged\ninto the blood lord's army from the\nflank. Xiao was shocked. Calling for\nhelp. Dinglay quickly bring your troops\nto support us. The Julie group who had\nbeen focused on preserving their\nstrength immediately launched a\nfull-scale counterattack. In an instant,\nthe forces were still 1,000 against\n2,000, and the blood lord held the\nadvantage. But with the addition of a\nlarge number of excellent and even epic\nunits by Chufinga, the situation was\ninstantly reversed. Everyone in the live\nstream was shocked. Has this turned the\ntables? The blood lord was caught\ncompletely offguard and is about to\nlose. Julie and Chufunga actually have\ndozens of epic spotted leopard\nberserkers and hundreds of excellent\nberserkers. Speaking of which, why are\nthese bloodthirsty lords targeting Julie\nand his group? And why did Julie and his\ngroup cross over to our region? I heard\nsomeone say that it's because Jolie is\nChuong Ji's good friend and Chuongu is\nLin Xiao's good friend. Later, I found\nout that the person who told me the news\nwas a bloodthirsty lord. I'm grateful he\nspared my life. The blood lord is their\nenemy, so the intelligence should be\nreliable. I see what true friendship.\nHow enviable. I also hope to have\nfriends like that. The new lords were\nall young people who had just come of\nage and graduated. They were at the age\nof being a bit immature and rebellious.\nWhen they saw such a passionate event,\nthey couldn't help but cheer for\nChufinga and the others. Go for it,\nred-haired kid. Go for it, long-haired\nJulie. On the other side, he who was\nsurrounded had only a few dozen soldiers\nleft under Tu Shawn by Chian's command\nare now reduced to less than 200 due to\nthe flower demons self-destruction and\nTu Shawn by Chian's occasional attacks\nby transformed demonic beasts. The\nbutterfly knife gritted his teeth. You\nactually have such strength. Then I\nwon't capture you alive. I'll just kill\nyou all. After saying that, he tossed\nthe butterfly knife aside, put it in his\npocket, and called to the two heroes\nbeside him, \"Let's go.\" The man drew a\nlong sword and charged forward in one\nstride. But at that moment, the rare\nhero beside him suddenly grabbed his\nneck from behind and stabbed him in the\nback, the knife protruding through his\nchest. The butterfly knife coughed up\nblood and turned around in disbelief.\nYour loyalty level was 70 points. How\ncould you betray me? He did not betray\nyou. I let him die a quick death. Rare\nhero said in a low voice as if it came\nfrom his belly. The butterfly knife\nstared in astonishment as his rare hero\nslowly transformed before his eyes. It\ntransformed into a creature with only a\npale face. There were no organs on that\nface. \"You You are the faceless one. You\ngot it right. Here's your reward.\" The\nfaceless one said in a low voice,\ngrabbed the man with the butterfly\nknife, and suddenly pulled out the sharp\nblade that had pierced through him. The\nman collapsed, spitting blood. Another\nhero next to the man was still in shock\nand didn't know what had happened when\nanother soldier suddenly attacked and\npierced through the stunned hero with a\nsingle shot. This seemed to trigger a\nsignal and dozens of soldiers mixed in\nwith the besieging Hay Tan and Bai\nChians team suddenly turned around and\nattacked killing their comrades.\nEveryone in the live stream was stunned.\nThe faceless one. It's the faceless one.\nAmong the heroes and troops of these\nbloodthirsty lords, there are quite a\nfew faceless ones lurking. Someone\nexclaimed, \"This is an epic level unit,\nelite spies of the demon race. They can\ntransform into any human form. Faceless\nones, demons, who's coming to the rescue\nof the pretty girl and the guy with\nkidney deficiency. The live stream\nchattered excitedly. And Heay and Tu\nShan by Chian were also astonished. They\nhad originally planned to end their\nlives in a dramatic way. Who knew that\nsomeone in the enemy ranks would\nsuddenly betray them? And someone was\neven shouting about the Faceless Ones or\nsomething. This rekindled their hope of\nsurvival. He tu Shan by Chian over here.\nA hurried voice called out. The two\nlooked over and saw that it was Chun\nNingming. He wielded a black wind axe\nand hacked his way through the enemy\nlines. Chin Ningming, what brings you\nhere? Tu Shan by Chin asked, both\nsurprised and delighted. The boss sent\nme to rescue you. Hurry up. Kill all\nthese people and we're leaving. The\nboss? The faceless one is the boss. He's\neye sparkled. I knew boss Lin Sha\nwouldn't abandon us. Chun Ningming\nchopped down a panicked, bloodthirsty\nlord in front of him with a single axe\nblow, and the live stream was\nimmediately shut down. But everyone\nheard what was said. The Faceless One is\nactually Lin Xiao. Lin Shiao has made\nhis move. Chapter 11. The Templar\nKnights make their debut. An invincible\nforce. Lin Shiao made a move. The\nFaceless One is Lin Xiao's. The 20\nFaceless Ones, an epic unit skilled in\nassassination and mixed among the blood\nlords troops, caused astonishing\ndestruction with Chun Ningming suddenly\nleading troops to their rescue. The\nblood lords were immediately routed. To\neveryone's astonishment, Chun Ningming\nalong with Hiz and Tu Shan by Chien\ncharged left and right, quickly killing\nall the bloodthirsty lords and soldiers\nwho came to besiege them. Only a few\nlords escaped with their lives. Boss\nBlack Flame, help. Lyn Sha has a backup\nplan. He has infiltrated a faceless one\namong us. The monkey was ambushed and is\ndead. The pretty girl and the weakwilled\nguy have already broken through and\nescaped. Useless thing. Black Flame\nspoke coldly in the chat channel.\nUseless. All of them are useless. Looks\nlike I'll have to take action myself.\nDing. Contestant XX has started their\nlive stream. Ding. Contestant XX has\nstarted their live stream. Several live\nstreams opened in succession and Black\nFlame coldly spoke. Let you country\nbumpkins in the newbie zone see how the\ntruly powerful units in the official\nzone crushed the enemy. Countless\nviewers flocked to the live stream. My\ngod, this is cavalry. Black flame\nbrought cavalry. What a formidable\ncavalry force. From the perspective of\nthe live stream, a cavalry regiment\nslowly accelerated. The cavalry regiment\nwas small, numbering around a 100 men.\nTheir ranks were neat, and their flags\nwere shining. Each of them rode a\nmagnificent and imposing steed, its head\nclad in a mask, its breastplate hanging\nin front, its body covered in chain\nmail, and its body covered in a heavy\nhorse coat. On the horse's coat, the\nwhite background with a bright red cross\nis eye-catching. The knight was covered\nin shiny plate armor, wore a helmet with\na face shield, held a shield in his left\nhand, and held a lance more than 3 m\nlong in his right hand. The knight's\ntunic and shield also bear the same\nwhite background and red cross symbol.\nThey marched in neat formation, slowly\naccelerating as they crossed a gentle\nhill. The knight in charge was clad in\nmagnificent full body plate armor with\nintricate designs and exquisite patterns\nalong with his horse. Preparation. At\nthe command of the commander at the\nforefront, all the knights\nsimultaneously lowered their face armor.\nThe armor was thick and the knights\ncould only see through a small gap in\ntheir visors. Otherwise, there were no\ngaps. Charge. The war horses accelerated\nonce more, their thunderous hoves\nshattering the wilderness and shaking\nthe earth. The steel torrent had taken\nshape. Even at such a high speed, the\nknights remained perfectly organized as\nif they were one unit without the\nslightest disorder. All the knights\nsimultaneously lowered their lances, the\nmassive lances pointing straight ahead.\nThe entire nightly order was like a\nsharp sword flying forward at breakneck\nspeed. And the knight commander at the\nvery front of the procession is the very\nedge of this sword. They're heading to\nChufinger's place. Someone suddenly\nrealized what was happening. From the\nperspective of the live stream, the\nknights had already climbed over the\nearthn slope beneath their feet. Below\nthe slope, Chuunga, Julie, and the\nremaining bloodlords were engaged in a\nchaotic battle. So, Black Flame had\nprepared its troops all along, just\nwaiting for this moment. To everyone's\nsurprise, the entire nightly order had\nalready crossed the hill. The heavily\narmored knights, who were already\nsprinting at full speed, became even\nfaster on the gentle downhill road. The\nknights marched straight toward the\nbattlefield like thunder. Chufinga,\nleading his 800 berserkers, was\nsuppressing Xiao Ela&lt;unk&gt;s rare troops,\nreducing Ziao Ela and other bloodlords\ntroops to only a few hundred. Hearing\nthe thunderous sound of hoofs, he turned\naround and saw a heavily armored cavalry\ncharging towards him. Damn it. Retreat.\nZia Lelay turned his head and saw the\napproaching cavalry regiment. He\ncouldn't help but smile. Harah Lord\nBlack Flames reinforcements have\narrived. Chufinga Julie, you'd better\nleave your lives behind. Xiao\nimmediately ordered his troops to focus\nall their efforts on keeping Chufinga's\nberserkers at bay and preventing them\nfrom escaping. Over here, I've held them\noff quick. Hurry up. It's good that\nyou're here. They're over there. Before\nXiao could finish speaking, he was\nslammed into the sky by the knights who\nshowed no signs of slowing down and his\nbody shattered into several pieces.\nDing! Player Xiao has been eliminated.\nBefore the soldiers behind him could\nreact, they too were knocked down and\ncrushed by the knights. Then the sharp\nknights cut into the battlefield from\none end and charged out from the other\nwithout hesitation, directly clearing a\nvacuum zone in the battlefield. The\nknights charged out of the battlefield,\nslowly turned around and prepared to\ncharge again at the command of their\ncaptain. The viewers in the live stream\nwere stunned. Hey, Xiao Lelay is still\nleading his troops in a fierce battle\nwith Chufunga, Julie, and others there.\nThe Knights of Black Flame, ignoring\nthem completely, charged straight in.\nBlack Flame is truly cold-blooded. Huh,\nuseless trash should be eliminated. At\nleast it held off the enemy before it\ndied, so it had some value. Black\nFlame's arrogant words suddenly rang\nout. Our celestial beings organization\ndoes not accept trash charge. As Black\nFlame finished speaking, the knights\nturned around and their perfectly\naligned formation didn't even need to be\nrearranged before they launched their\nsecond charge. RT Chufinga pulled Jolie,\nWong Bo, and Pans Shan Yu back quickly\nwhile his dozens of leopard berserkers\nand the remaining elite berserkers\nquickly lined up to prepare to meet the\nenemy. Where are our troops? Without us,\nthere are no troop bonuses. How can we\nwin? Pans Shan Yu was about to return\nwhen Chufunga and Jolie, without saying\na word, quickly helped him up and ran\naway. As Chufunga and his companions led\nthe heroes in a frantic escape, the\nknights behind them once again formed an\niron torrent, charging straight down.\nRoar! The Berserkers roared in unison\nand swung their giant axis. The next\nsecond, the Berserker Legion was\nmercilessly torn apart. Blood and flesh\nflying everywhere. The Berserker didn't\neven manage to strike the heavily\narmored knights before being pierced by\nan oncoming lance. Roar! The Panther\nBerserker, being an epic unit, continued\nits fearless attack even in its final\nmoments. Some berserkers swung their\ngiant axes and hurled them at the\nknights. Some berserkers broke off the\nspears embedded in their bodies and used\nthe broken spears to block the knights\nand their war horses. Someers, bleeding\nprofusely, still leaped forward,\nintending to fight with their fists and\nteeth. However, in the next instant, the\nunstoppable cavalry continued to advance\nstraight ahead. The knights in the front\nrow drew their long swords, and the\nknights in the back row raised their\nlances, riding their heavily armored\nwarh horses and mercilessly crushing the\nBerserker Legion that was fighting to\nthe death. We can't win, Chufinga said\nin a low voice. From the moment this\nnightly order emerged, we had already\nlost. We must escape immediately.\nSoldiers can be recruited again if they\ndie. But if the Lord dies, he is truly\ndead. Several hundred berserkers blocked\nthe fearless charge of the knights while\nChufinga and his companions fled with\nthe heroes and a small number of\nremaining soldiers. Those who cannot win\nwill undoubtedly lose. Suddenly, someone\nside in the live stream. From the moment\nthe Knights Templar appeared, the battle\nband of these few people was destined to\nbe destroyed. Everyone fell silent. The\nKnights Templar. Suddenly, someone\nnoticed the key point in that sentence.\nHow did you know it was the Knights\nTemplar? He he I have been fighting in\nother worlds for many years. How could I\nnot know the famous golden legendary\nunit, the Templar Knight? Everyone was\nstunned. Upon closer inspection, it\nbecame clear that the speaker hadn't\nhidden their ID. The displayed name was\nGene Wuang. Gene Wooang. You were the\nancestor of the Gene family, one of the\nchief lords representing the Huasha\ndomain in the ninth heaven. The ancestor\nof Gene Dang. He he is indeed this old\nman. But who is Gene Dang? Chapter 112.\nThe explanation of the Gene family\nancestor. Who is Gene Dang? It's Gene\nDang, the one Lin Sha killed. So it was\nthat good for nothing collateral\ndescendant. Gene Wuang sighed, muttering\nto himself. I gave away too many\namulets. The patriarch of the Jean\nfamily. It's actually the patriarch of\nthe Jean family. The audience in the\nlive stream gasped in surprise. The Gan\nfamily patriarch has returned to the\ndragon summer domain. He's back in the\ndragon south region. Can we watch the\nlive stream directly? Is the Gan family\npatriarch going to deal with Lynn Shiao\npersonally? No. I merely returned to L\nnon with an avatar simply to see what\nthis kid Lin Sha is capable of. Gene\nWuang said Lin Sha is a junior not worth\nme personally dealing with. Someone\nrecalled the conversation when Lin Sha\nkilled Gene Dang in front of Gene Wuang\nand suddenly asked, \"Ances of the Gene\nfamily, does this clone of yours have\nany fighting ability? Of course not.\nWhat's it to you? The Gan family\npatriarch struck where it hurt angrily\nsaid.\" Youngsters, just enjoy the fight.\nMy ancestors health is none of your\nconcern. After a few seconds of silence,\neveryone tacitly changed the subject.\nAncestor, why do you say that once the\nKnights Templar are deployed,\nChufinger's troops will undoubtedly\nlose? When Gene Wuang saw someone asking\nfor advice, he said, \"The Knights\nTemplar are one of the three most\npowerful nightly orders in Europe. In\nour Dragon Sia, only a few people have\nthe authority to recruit them. The\nKnights Templar are marked by a white\nbackground with a red cross. You can see\nthat on the horses, the knight's\nshields, and their cloaks of this 100man\nwar band, there is only a conspicuous\nwhite background with a red cross. They\nwere all fully armored, and every knight\nwas a master of defense, melee combat,\nand spearmanship. Their horses were also\nhybrids of monsters, strong and\nfearless. Gene Wuwang side. Although the\nTemplar Knights do not have the same\nsuper high bonuses in the hands of the\nOrthodox European powers as they do in\nthe hands of the Dragon Sea people,\ntheir status as a gold legendary unit\nalone is enough to crush all units below\nthe legendary level. In the ninth\nheaven, I sometimes fight alongside the\nEuropean nations and sometimes I clash\nwith them. But as long as any one of the\nthree great nightly orders sends out\ntheir troops, unstoppable. When the\nKnights Templar appear, no one can stop\nthem. With just a few simple words, the\naudience in the live stream was\ncaptivated and deeply impressed. Amidst\nthe shock, someone sighed. I never\nexpected that the celestial beings would\nsend out their most powerful legendary\ngold unit to deal with a mere newbie\nzone lord. This is quite a large\nundertaking. Gene Wuang also agreed. The\nCelestials, a small and shabby\norganization that was just on the run a\nfew decades ago, has now developed to\nsuch a state. This time, it's not just\nabout killing Lin Sha, but also about\ndeclaring our strength to the world.\nSomeone in the live stream asked\ncuriously, \"Ances, aren't you with them?\nMe?\" He he even their leader, Hu, Dawei,\nis not qualified to ask me to do it. Do\nyou have any temper knights under your\ncommand, Ancestor? you. Gene Wuang\nshouted, \"Don't pry into the affairs of\nyour elders here.\" After four rounds of\nattacks, the Templar Knights have wiped\nout all the Berserkers. They didn't even\nspare the heroes and troops of their own\nbloodthirsty lords. All 100 Templar\nknights survived and scathed, suffering\nonly minor injuries and some weapon\ndamage during the Panther Berserker's\ndesperate counterattack. The entire\nbattlefield was littered with corpses\nand rivers of blood. Did the secondary\ntarget escape? The knight at the very\nfront of the order lifted his visor,\nrevealing a handsome western face with\nblonde hair, blue eyes, and a high nose.\nIt's all right. That's Ding Lays reserve\nposition. He can't run away. Mr. Rom was\nexceptionally brave, annihilating\nthousands of enemies in a single battle.\nWith Mr. Rom here, we can easily take\nLin Xiao's head. A loud voice rang out\nand a man of medium build with small\neyes, thin lips, and a scar on his face,\nslowly walked out. He wasn't wearing a\nhelmet, but rather a full suit of black\narmor, which was constantly emitting\nelucory flames. Clearly no ordinary\nitem. Needless to say, everyone knows\nthat this is Black Flame. Black Flame\nwas accompanied by two heroes. One of\nwhom had black skin, dreadlocks, and a\nbare upper body with muscles so strong\nthey looked like they were about to\nexplode. The other hero was tall and\nslender, dressed in a green cloak and\nrobe with a long sword at his waist. He\nwore a seveneyed green glowing gaze\npiece on his head, making him look both\nstrange and menacing. It's the Wuji\nSword Saint E. The knowledgeable\npatriarch of the Gene family explained\ndirectly in the live broadcast room.\nThis is an extremely powerful epic\nquality hero in the official zone whose\none-on-one combat ability is even\nstronger than many golden legendary\nheroes. I don't recognize the other My\nLittle Pony. Just as everyone was about\nto question what Gene Wuang meant by\nRainbow Pony, they saw that following\nbehind Black Flame were squads of elite\nsoldiers. There were spearmen,\nswordsmen, archers, dwarven warriors,\nand a unit that seemed so elucory as if\nit didn't exist. These soldiers were all\nexuding a murderous aura and arrogance,\nclearly extraordinary. With the Templar\nKnights, who just appeared, the entire\nlegion of a thousand men is now present.\nIt's over,\" the Gene family patriarch\nmuttered to himself. \"We've really lost\nout by sneaking out this time. There's\nhardly any interesting back and forth\nfighting before it's about to end.\"\nLeaving aside the 100 legendary gold\nquality Templar knights, the remaining\n900 troops are all epic quality units.\nHow is Lynn Shiao supposed to fight\nthem? Epic units, 900. The audience in\nthe live stream was shocked. Black Flame\nalso spoke at this moment. Lyn Shia, you\ndid a good job. With just your lackey\nand a few cronies, you defeated half of\nmy bloodthirsty team. I must admit, I\nunderestimated you a little. But now,\nI'm going to take it seriously. Now,\neveryone, listen up. I, Black Flame,\nwill show you the power of the\nCelestials. Here, I have 100 holy\nknights of legendary gold quality. There\nare still 900 epic level units. All of\nthem are level 30. Lyn Sha, what do you\nhave to fight me with? Courage. Black\nFlame immediately gave the order. 200\ndwarf warriors stepped out of the ranks\nand headed towards the flank of the\nCalabash Mountains. Some viewers with\nbetter geographical knowledge\nimmediately realized that these dwarves\nintended to cross the mountains directly\nand attack Lin Xiao's territory. The\nother 100 archers, each wielding a giant\nbow nearly 2 m long, quickly turned and\npursued Chufinga. All troops attack.\nRaise Lynho's lord's manner to the\nground. The remaining 700 soldiers\nformed a large battle group and slowly\nadvanced towards Lin Xiao's territory\nwith Black Flame leading the heroes to\njoin them. Dinglay, I'm giving you a\nchance to get revenge. Quickly hand over\nthe heads of Chu Funga, Julie, and the\nothers. Meanwhile, Dinglay led over a\nthousand soldiers on a march, walking at\nthe very front with a blank expression.\nHurry up, Dinglay. Otherwise, they'll\nescape. A fat man with a face full of\nscars shouted behind Ding Lay,\naccompanied by Shadow Fiend. He was\nalready a little excited by the current\nsituation. After Black Flame appeared,\nthe situation was in a sure win, and the\nfat man was eager to take credit.\nRemember this, on the battlefield,\nthere's only one leader. Dinglay\nsuddenly turned around and roared at the\nfat man. As a former bigwig, Ding Lay\nexuded doineering aura, leaving even the\nchubby guy who had always been at odds\nwith him speechless. \"Form ranks before\nyou advance,\" Dinglay said angrily. \"I\ndon't want to be caught off guard\nagain.\" No one noticed the fleeting\ndetermination in Ding Lays eyes. Chapter\n113. The Epic Legion shocks everyone. On\nthe battlefield, Black Flame led his\nbrightly colored legion forward slowly.\nThe heavy footsteps echoed through the\nlive stream, reaching every viewer. Such\na powerful pressure. No wonder it's a\nlegion with all legendary and epic\nunits. Black Flame merged several\ndifferent live stream perspectives into\none large live stream. All viewers can\nsimultaneously see the movements of the\nvarious legions of the Black Flame\nLegion. At this moment, everyone\nrealized that Black Flame had actually\narranged for people to be stationed a\nfew hundred meters away from the\nentrance of Linhao&lt;unk&gt;s territory at\nthe entrance of Calabash Pass and opened\na live broadcast view, pointing at his\ngate from afar. At this moment, the\nwalls of Lin Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s territory stood\nhigh, the gates were tightly closed, and\nthere was no movement. Everyone looked\nfrom other perspectives. Dinglay led\nover a thousand soldiers in neat\nformations towards Lin Xiao's territory.\nAt this pace, they would soon encounter\nthe fleeing Chufunga and his companions.\nMore than a thousand bloodthirsty Lord\ntroops who had started climbing the\nCalabash Mountains earlier were like\nmountain savages. They had now\nsuccessfully climbed to the top of the\nmountain and were about to descend and\nrush into Liao's rear. 200 dwarf\nwarriors also arrived at the foot of the\nCalabash Mountains and quickly climbed\nthe mountain. If they succeeded, they\nwould follow the climbing route opened\nup by the blood lord to enter Lin Xiao's\nrear, adding fuel to the fire for Lin\nShiao, who was already in a difficult\nsituation. The 100 archers were\nincredibly fast. They were about to\nencircle Ding Lays army. The remaining\n600 warriors under Black Flames command,\nincluding 100 Templar Knights marched\nslowly toward the main gate of Linia's\nterritory with an imposing gate. The\natmosphere grew increasingly tense.\nEveryone knew that Lin Shiao had no way\nto avoid the final battle with Black\nFlame. The number of viewers in the live\nstream surged again, reaching hundreds\nof thousands. ancestor of the Gene\nfamily. You just said that apart from\nthe Templar Knights, the rest are epic\nunits. Do you recognize all of these\nunits? He You guys didn't study your\nacademic subjects well, you'll suffer\nwhen you go to war later. Gene Wuang\nsaid, \"Of course, I know them all. The\nBlack Flame Legion's Vanguard consists\nof 200 Sunfire Spearmen, an epic level\nunit known as the strongest spearman on\nland. If I remember correctly, one of\ntheir skills is scorching sun. Under the\nscorching sun, these spearmen can focus\na sliver of the sun's power onto the tip\nof their spears, unleashing a\ndevastating attack when they strike the\nenemy. One is sun protection, which\ngives sun spearmen a 20% bonus to all\nattributes when fighting under the sun.\nOne is the cavalry buster, which will\nnot waver or fear when facing cavalry\ncharges and increases the damage to\ncavalry by 20%. This type of troop was\noriginally trained to counter the three\nmajor nightly orders. Although it was\nultimately proven that it was still no\nmatch for the heavy knights, no cavalry\nunder the three major nightly orders\ncould match it. Black flame is\npreventing Lin Sha from upgrading to\nlevel three and recruiting cavalry.\nLooking at the blazing sun, the\nscorching spears of the spearmen, their\norderly ranks, and then at the sun high\nabove the battlefield of all races.\nEveryone understood that on the\nbattlefield today, the blazing\nsunspearman could utilize all his skills\nand fight at his peak. As for the second\nformation, there are 300 iron wall\ncrusaders, a very famous unit that once\nled several major crusades that clashed\nwith the Abbassad caliphate for hundreds\nof years. They were chain mail and wield\nbroadswords possessing both defensive\nand offensive capabilities. Apart from\ntheir slow movement speed, they have\nvirtually no weaknesses. Gene Wuang\nslowly said, \"What impressed me most was\ntheir skill, dual sword style. When\nattacking the enemy, they can unleash\ntwo swift consecutive slashes dealing\ntons of damage. The crowd erupted in\nuproar. As expected of an epic unit,\nnone of them are weak. Hulu Pass, Lin\nXiao's territory. Inside the war hall,\nLin Shiao projected the live stream onto\nthe screen, holding the materials given\nto him by Dugu Jaolon while introducing\nthem to everyone in the hall. Following\nbehind are 100 shadow lurkers, which are\nalmost formless units. A natural\nassassin and killer, his abilities at\nnight are no less than those of my\nfaceless men. Even during the day, he\ncan unleash 80% of his power. They have\na few skills to watch out for. One of\nwhich is shadow jump, which allows them\nto jump from one shadow to another\nwithin a certain range to launch a\nsurprise attack. The other is block. If\na ranged unit attacked by the shadow\nlurker at close range continues to use\nranged weapons, the shadow lurker will\nhave a 100% critical hit rate against\nit. Song Rui turned his head, exchanged\na glance with Tang Yi, and said, \"It\nlooks like they're targeting weak-\nranged units like us.\" Tang Yi laughed\nheartily. \"Everyone knows that Guster\nthe Archer is just as fragile as the\nPhantom Archer when the fight starts. Be\ncareful not to twist your fist or crack\nyour hand,\" Song Rui said in a deep\nvoice. \"I almost couldn't put away the\n40 m long broadsword.\" Lynn Sha\ncontinued, \"The troops that went after\nChufinga were the famous British long\nbowman. I remember memorizing the\nworld's number one, the number one range\nwhen I was in school. This epic unit was\nthe one with the longest range.\" Lyn\nShaide, every long bowman on the sun\nnever sets begins training at the age of\n13, and only the most outstanding ones\ncan go to the battlefield at the age of\n20. They can draw a 2meter long bow with\na maximum range of 300 m and can\npenetrate most armor on the battlefield\nof all races. These long bowmen are\nfamous throughout the world. While most\narchers can only shoot about 100 m, the\nlong bow is like a sniper rifle, both\nlong range and accurate. Even flying a\nkite can kill most of the enemies. The\ndownside is the common weakness of\nranged units. Weak in melee combat and\nmoderate movement speed. Everyone fell\nsilent for a moment. Song Rui and Tang\nYi exchanged a glance, but Saul Lin was\nnowhere to be seen. Pay Min stubbornly\nasked, \"My lord, what is a sniper rifle?\nA shooting device capable of hitting\ntargets at a range of at least 1,000 m.\"\nSong Ruer, whose only visible feature\nwas his eyes beneath the iron helmet,\ngasped for breath, while O Yzi, who had\nbeen dozing nearby, snapped his eyes\nopen instantly. My lord may provide a\nmore detailed explanation. Oh, Yzi&lt;unk&gt;s\neyes lit up. We&lt;unk&gt;ll talk about this\nafter the war is over. Lyn Shiao said,\n\"My lord, what does flying a kite mean?\"\nPayman asked again. It means keeping\nyour distance from the enemy while\nshooting and running. Quitsubing\nreplied, \"When I fought against the\nShiong new, their mounted archers also\nused this technique. Your analogy is\nvery apt, my lord.\" Lin Sha nodded in\nsatisfaction, glanced at Pay Min as if\nto say, \"We're&lt;unk&gt; both generals. Why\ndo you only possess brute force and are\nnot as good at fighting as Houbing?\"\nPayman shrugged and Lynn Sha continued.\nThe troops heading north of the Holian\nMountains consist of 200 mountain dwarf\nwarriors. This is an epic dwarf\nspecializing in mountain warfare whose\nstatus among the dwarves is only\nslightly lower than that of the mountain\nking and rune master. Their skills\ninclude mountain warrior, resistant\nskin, burrowing, treasure hunting,\nmining, and heavy drinking. Wait, the\nlast few don't seem like combat skills.\nLynn Shiao couldn't continue speaking\nwhile Chin Leong Yu across from him\nsmiled beautifully, but she forced\nherself to remain serious as the battle\nwas about to begin. \"Okay, I see you're\nsmiling.\" Lyn Shao glared at Chin Leong\nYu and said, \"Long Yu, take your white\npole, spearman, and proceed according to\nthe original plan. Let these mountain\ndwarfs see who the true king of the\nmountains is.\" Lean Yu obeys. Chin Leong\nYu clasped her hands in a fist salute,\nher fiery red cloak billowing as she\nhurried away. All right, everyone. Lyn\nShia clapped his hands. Soul Darren and\nChin Leon, you have already taken the\nlead. Now it's your turn to step forward\nand join me in eliminating the foreign\nenemy and upholding the glory of China.\nI am willing to serve my lord. The\nsoldiers responded loudly and marched\nout of the war hall in unison. only\nBaoi, clad in a cloak, looked at Lin Sha\nwith teary eyes, \"My lord, I couldn't be\nof much help.\" \"No, you are the most\nimportant link.\" Lyn Sha reached out and\ngrasped Ba's soft hand, saying gently,\n\"Lend me the fortune within your body.\"\nHaving said that, he pulled Baoi into\nhis arms. Chapter 114. Desperate\nsituation. Lynn Shiao summons the spirit\nof an emperor. \"Careful!\" Chufunga\nshouted and shoved Wong Bo aside, then\nrolled on the spot. Ju Lee and Pan Sha\nYu, who were standing nearby, also heard\nthe sound of something cutting through\nthe air and immediately dodged. Swish,\nswish, swish. Arrows rain down. Oh. The\nfleeing Berserkers were caught off guard\nand riddled with arrows falling from the\nsky. It's archers. The archers are\ncatching up. Chufunga continued to pull\nthe people off the ground and said,\n\"Speed up. Keep running. Chufinga's\nremaining dozen or so leopard berserkers\nand the head-hunting master from Julie\nturned around forming a fragile\ndefensive line to try and stop the\npursuing archers. Why can't I see\nanyone? Just then, another volley of\narrows flew in long parabolas, falling\nswiftly straight down. Ah! Another\nscream of soldiers falling to the\nground. \"Let's give it our all.\" The\nheroes of Chufunga and his companions\nwere inspired. And in order to protect\ntheir lord, they stopped fleeing. My\nlord, the enemy must have used a speed\nboosting spell to catch up. We must stop\nthem, but please leave immediately.\nGood. Chufinga didn't say much and\ncontinued his escape. Behind them,\nanother volley of arrows rained down.\nWith this range, could they be long\nbowman from the British Empire? The fate\nof the heroes and the remnants behind\nhim was already sealed. Chufinga gritted\nhis teeth and sighed inwardly. In the\nend, they still couldn't lure out the\nmain force of the black flames. The mere\npresence of Long Bowman did little to\nalleviate the pressure on Lin Sha. As he\npondered, a large group of people\nappeared ahead, and Chufinga&lt;unk&gt;s\nexpression grew even more serious.\nDingle, not far ahead, there was Ding\nLay and the blood lord's army. Did you\nsee that? This is the power of an epic\nunit, the undying long bowman. In the\nlive stream, Gene Wuang excitedly said,\n\"A shooting range of 300 m is roughly\nequivalent to a lap around the soccer\nfield in your school. It would take you\nstudents with poor physical condition\nmore than a minute to run that distance.\nEven if the cavalry chases after them,\nthey'll take several arrows.\nArmor-piercing arrows can completely\npenetrate the vast majority of armor.\"\nChufinga and the others have no chance\nof escape. The audience in the live\nstream fell silent. Head hunter master\nand panther berserker were also epic\nunits, but they were wiped out by a\nvolley of arrows before they even saw\nthe enemy. Before they could charge\nforward, the hundred long bowman had\nalready slaughtered all of Chufinga's\nheroes and the remaining soldiers. The\nunparalleled long bowman's incredible\nrange deeply impressed them. A sense of\npowerlessness pierced everyone's hearts.\nDinglays troops also blocked Chufunga\nand his group at this moment. Careful. A\nsnow white fox spirit called out. Chun\nNingming flipped over to avoid the harpy\ns attack, then turned around and killed\nthe harpy who had ambushed him with an\naxe. They've caught up. They're here to\nintercept us. He shouted, \"Harpies,\ngargoyles. Those mountain climbing\ntroops have spun off their flying units\nspecifically to deal with us.\" \"I know,\"\nthe fox spirit said crisply. Run this\nway. The bloodthirsty Lord Legion that\ncrossed the mountain dispatched 300\nflying units specifically to pursue Tu\nShawn by Chien and her companions. By T\nShawn by Chien, who had transformed into\na demon, the small team of only a few\ndozen people charged left and right,\ndodging and moving forward along the\nmountainous terrain. Unfortunately,\nalthough the epic faceless ones are very\npowerful, they are basically ineffective\nagainst overwhelming numbers and aerial\nattacks from flying units. The pretty\ngirls won't be able to escape either.\nSomeone in the live stream side, it was\nsaid that although these people were\nweak, they still had some guts. What a\npity. He's going to die here, too. They\ncan't escape, Gene Wuang commented. The\nFaceless Ones are unable to deal with\nflying units, and none of them have\narchers. Rare quality harpies and\nexcellent quality gargoyles alone could\nwear them down. Besides, the dwarf\nmountain warriors have caught up with\nus. Well, someone in the live stream\nside. Chufunga and the others have been\nsurrounded, and Zay May and the others\nhave also been intercepted. All of Lyn\nXiao's helpers are in dire need of their\nown safety. Lyn Shiao himself is left\nwith only a lone force about to be wiped\nout by the black flame. He's in a\ndesperate situation. For some reason,\nfaced with the overwhelming power of the\nBlack Flames, everyone began to feel a\nsense of sympathy for Lin Shiao and his\ngroup. Perhaps it's because Lin Shiao\ndared to defy powerful figures. Perhaps\nit was Lyn Xiao's freespirited nature\nthat they envied. Perhaps it was because\nLin Shiao had attractive younger\nbrothers like Heay who were willing to\ntake risks for him. Perhaps it's the\nfriendship between Lin Shia and\nChufinga. and between Chufinga and the\nJulie group forged through life and\ndeath together. Perhaps it was the\narrogant attitude of the black flame and\nits disdain for the lords of the newbie\nzone that led to this. Perhaps it was\njust the collective feeling of shared\nmisfortune that made everyone at this\nmoment all the fellow novice lords\nsympathize with Lin Sha. As an orphan,\nhe struggled to survive alone in the\ndragon kingdom. Bearing the name of a\ngenius in Jangdong, he shone brightly\nduring his school years. But a talent\ntest revealed that he was a good for\nnothing. Entering the battlefield of all\nraces, they successfully turned the tide\nand won first place twice. But then they\nprovoked a behemoth they shouldn't have\nmessed with. His life was filled with\nsuch effort yet also such despair. After\nreleasing Baoi, whose face was flushed\nred, Lynsha took a deep breath. After\nBa's loyalty reaches 100, you can take\nher down and unlock the ability fate\ntransfer. Last night, an ancient demon\nsecretly told me this in my dream. It\ncan temporarily seize the luck of\neveryone on the battlefield and transfer\nit to a close person. Lyn Shia drew his\nCrimson Sky Sword, his eyes flashing.\nAll my troops and heroes are already at\nlevel 20 and the Guan Ning Iron Cavalry\nhas been replenished to 100 men using\nrecruitment tokens. The energy of the\n10,000 races battlefield has been almost\ncompletely exhausted. The remaining two\nepic quality recruitment tokens were\nused to recruit epic quality troops,\nwhich resulted in two teams of elite\ndemon scouts, the faceless ones. The\nrecruitment tokens have been used up.\nNow, as planned, I have 50 MO Dao iron\nguards, 50 divine arm archers, 50 white\npole spearmen, 49 phantom archers, 20\nfaceless warriors, and 100 Guan Ning\niron cavalry. With my current hero's\nsuper high bonus, powerful units, and\npre- battle strategy, defeating Black\nFlame in a fight to the death should not\nbe a problem. But how could mere Black\nFlames be worth the loss of my troops?\nNow is the time for me to make my move.\nLynn Shiao raised the Crimson Sky Sword\nhigh, its skills flashing through his\nmind. Imperial Way increases the\nluck. With the temporary transfer of\nBao's fortune, plus the fortune of the\nCrimson Sky Sword, my chances of\nsummoning the Chinese emperor to possess\nme have increased even more. Exchange\n1,000 points of the final battlefield of\nmyriad races energy to recharge and use\nthe Hasha token, Emperor's heroic soul,\nto summon. Look, Lyn Sha is out and he's\nbringing heroes and troops with him. In\nthe live stream, someone saw from one of\nthe perspectives that the gate to the\nterritory of Hulu Pass suddenly opened\nand a slowly emerged. The man at the\nfront was tall and imposing, dressed in\ndark armor with a handsome and\nextraordinary appearance and a dazzling\ndemeanor. It was none other than Lyn\nSha. Chapter 115. A head-on showdown\nwith Black Flame. Lyn Sha is out leading\na group of heroes and troops. He opened\nthe gates of his territory and slowly\nwalked out just as everyone's attention\nwas focused on him. \"Look, what's that?\"\nsomeone in the live stream exclaimed.\nFrom another perspective, a sky full of\narrows flew up. The arrow pierced\nthrough the gargoyles and harpies,\ncatching these flying units completely\noffguard. Tan by Chian, Hiz and Chin\nNingming were overjoyed. Our boss is\nhere to save us. Arrows rained down and\nTu Shawn by Chian and the others took\nthe opportunity to escape. The live\nstream camera flickered and the lord who\nstarted the live stream hurriedly turned\naround finally catching a glimpse of the\nfleeting figure on the ridge. Green\nleather armor, golden hair, pointed\nears, and white overalls. It's overalls.\nNo, it's Phantom Shooter. Lyn Shia sent\nPhantom Shooter to rescue the beautiful\ngirls. Lyn Sha really wouldn't abandon\nhis little brother. The crowd was in an\nuproar. Lynn Shiao had actually sent his\npowerful phantom archers to support his\nvassal lord at the crucial moment when\ntroops were most needed. What would\nhappen to the main battlefield? The\ncamera kept shaking as one flying unit\nafter another was shot down by the\nphantom archers. Just as air units have\nan advantage over ground units, archers\nalso have an overwhelming advantage over\nordinary air units. It seems that Tu\nShawn by Chin has been rescued. Don't be\ntoo happy yet. Look at the perspective\nof the dwarf mountain warriors. They've\narrived. Sure enough, the dwarves, who\nwere extremely skilled in mountain\nwarfare, moved swiftly and overtook the\nenemy, climbing up the ridge and\ncatching up with the troops who were\nblocking Tu Shawn by Chin and the\nothers. The Phantom Archers retreated.\nThe pretty girl and the others ran away\nwith them. The dwarf mountain warriors\nare an epic unit. The Phantom Archers\ndare not fight them head-on. My\ngoodness, the dwarves are so fast on the\nmountain. They're only a few hundred\nmeters away from the pretty girl and the\nothers. And they're keeping a close eye\non them. Just as the chase on the\nmountain ridge at the top of the Holian\nMountains was in full swing. Look over\nhere. Dinglay is about to start a fight,\ntoo. On the other side, Dinglay waved\nhis hand with a complicated expression,\nand the blood lords led more than a\nthousand soldiers to rush forward, about\nto overwhelm Chufunga and her three\ncompanions. Leading the charge were the\nfat man with a face full of scars and\nhis shadow fiend hero. Dingle, is it fun\nbeing black flames, lackey? Facing the\nsiege, the red-haired Chufunga smiled\ncontemptuously and stared at Ding Lay,\nsaying, \"You even claimed to be a genius\non par with Lin Sha, and I even\nconsidered you a worthy opponent in the\nnewbie zone. Yet, you were so pathetic.\nYou are actually an accomplice of the\nblood lord. They were acting from the\nvery beginning, deceiving everyone. You\nare not worthy to be Lin Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s\nopponent, nor are you worthy to be my\nopponent.\" After saying that, Shufinga\nand the others from Julie each opened a\nteleportation portal. Dinglay, I'm\nsorry, but without our heads, you\nprobably won't be able to get promoted.\nJust stay put among the bloodthirsty\nlords. The blood lords arrived too late\nand could only watch helplessly as Chu\nFunga and the other three entered the\nportal, which then closed abruptly.\nDidn't they already use a ceiling spell?\nHow did they manage to use a portal and\na one-way portal at that? The fat man\nwas so angry at missing his target that\nhe jumped up and down. Dinglay, it's all\nyour fault. You insisted on making us\nmarch in formation, which delayed our\nchance to strike. It can only be the\ntalent of a certain lord. Gene Wuang\ncommented. It's estimated that they can\nonly maintain a few single-use portals,\nso they'll only use them at the last\nminute. That's probably why that\nred-haired kid and his gang joined\nforces and were so fearless. Now that\nthe crisis involving the big- breasted\ngirl and the red-haired boy is\ntemporarily over, I can focus on\nwatching the duel between Lin Shia and\nBlack Flame. Gene Wuang exclaimed in\nsurprise, \"The undying Longbow Bowman\nare back.\" \"It turns out that after the\ntroops that shot and killed the\nred-haired man, the British Longbowman\nleft their lord with Ding Lelay and the\nothers and then used the swift marching\ntalisman again to rush back. With the\nlong bowman of the sun never setting and\nthe expensive speed rune, they are now\nvirtually without weaknesses. I knew it.\nThe large legion would definitely not\nleave out the archers in the decisive\nbattle against Black Flame. On the main\nbattlefield, the Long Bowman of the\nBritish Empire had actually caught up\nwith the slowly advancing Black Flame\nArmy and were now at the very front of\nthe column. The Black Flame Army has\nadvanced to within a kilometer of Lin\nXiao's territory. Lyn Shiao led his\ntroops out to meet them at that moment.\nLyn Xiao's side has infantry, archers,\nand cavalry. Although I don't recognize\nany of them except for Gust, I have to\nadmit he's quite fast. Gene Wuang became\naddicted to commentary and everyone in\nthe live stream became addicted to\nlistening. Ancestor of the Gene family,\nyou are a veteran of war and one of the\nchief lords of Langia. Could you analyze\nthe comparison of the strengths of both\nsides? Gene Wuang stroked his goatee\nclearly pleased with the praise in the\nlive stream and immediately said, \"Lin\nXiao only has 200 troops on his side.\nBlack Flame has 800 members.\" Lyn Xiao's\nforces are at a significant\ndisadvantage. Lyn Shiao ordered the\ncavalry to lead the way, the archers to\nthe flanks, and the infantry to follow\nbehind. The Black Flame Longbow Bowman\nlead the way. The Shadow Lurkers are on\nthe flanks. The Sunspearmen are in the\nsecond row. The Iron Wall Crusaders are\nin the middle and the Templar Knights\nbring up the rear. Lyn Xiao's troop\ndeployment has major problems. What's\nthe problem? Someone asked in the live\nstream. Jin Wuang paused for a few\nseconds before slowly revealing the\nreason. A barrage of arrows from long\nrange archers before they can directly\nconfront the Black Flame. Lyn Xiao's\narchers are on the flanks and they will\nbe instantly killed by the shadow\nlurkers of the Black Flame. Then Lyn\nXiao's remaining cavalry charged while\nthe longbow bowman, having already\nexhausted their arrows, retreated.\nTherefore, Lynn Zhao's cavalry would be\nmercilessly intercepted and annihilated\nby the Blazing Sun Spearman. In the end,\nLynho's infantry was completely wiped\nout by the encirclement and suppression\nof the Sunless Long Bowman, the Blazing\nSun Spearman, and the Iron Wall\nCrusaders. The Knights Templar don't\neven need to lift a finger. This is\nunder the assumption that Linhao's\ntroops are capable of fighting against\nBlack Flames troops. The fact is Black\nFlames troops are all gold, legendary,\nand epic troops, and all of them are\nlevel 30. I don't recognize Linia's unit\ntype, but even if I overestimate it, its\nlevel definitely won't exceed level 20.\nLyn Shiao is doomed. As they spoke, the\nBlack Flame Legion was getting closer\nand closer to Lin Shiao. In the live\nstream, Lyn Xiao's figure became clearer\nand clearer. Lyn Shiao, you are doomed.\nBlack Flame roared, leaving its\nannouncement in the live stream and chat\nchannel, and then commanded all its\nunits to accelerate forward. Here it\ncomes. Everyone held their breath,\nalmost afraid to breathe as they watched\nthis scene, lest they miss any exciting\nmoments. Both sides rushed off to their\nrespective destinations. Distance 1,000\nm, 800 m, 600 m, 500 m, 400 m away.\nWhoosh! The sound of something cutting\nthrough the air suddenly rang out.\n\"Huh!\" Everyone was stunned, only to see\nthe longbow bowman of the British Empire\nstanding at the front row fall to the\nground with a thud. Many Longbow Bowman\ndied with an expression of disbelief and\nshock still lingering on their faces. He\nI knew I was talking nonsense. Jin\nWuwang was greatly alarmed. Lynn\nZhao&lt;unk&gt;s archers have started shooting\nalready. Those who fell were actually\nthe long bowman of the British Empire.\nChapter 116. Divine arm bow vs long bow.\nGuan Ning iron cavalry vss blazing\nsunspearman. Before the long bowman of\nthe British Empire could react, a large\nnumber of them were instantly knocked\ndown. Swish, swish, swish. The sound of\narrows piercing the air continued. The\nrange of the British long bowman has\nincreased again. Now they're firing from\n400 m away. Black flame standing in the\ncenter of the army, said lazily, but\nscreams of agony continued to echo from\nthe front. Black Flame suddenly\nrealized, \"Was it my long bowman who was\nshot down?\" Black Flame quickly looked\nup and saw that the arrows were coming\nfrom the iron canner's archers on the\ntwo flanks of Linhao&lt;unk&gt;s formation.\nThose giant iron canisters wielding\nenormous crossbows would pull back the\nmassive bolts with one hand, knock\narrows, and unleash a volley every\nsecond. Fast and accurate. At the\nforefront of the army's formation had\ntheir breastplates easily pierced by the\nlong crossbow bolts. At this point, the\nlong bowman had not yet reached their\nmaximum range. What's going on? It's the\nGust Archers. How come the Gust archers\nhave a longer range than the Long\nBowman? Black flames are enraged.\nLongbow bowman retreat immediately. A\nprecious troop that his elder brother\nWong Su had obtained from Pu Dawei, the\nleader of the heavenly people. He had\nsuffered heavy losses because of his\ncarelessness. Shadow lurker, use your\nshadow to leap over and kill those\nwretched archers. All troops attack.\nJust as Black Flame was hastily ordering\na change in formation, Lin Sha s archers\nhad already fired three rounds. Two\narchers each shot at the same long\nbowman. One arrow aimed at the head and\nthe other at the heart. The divine\narcher armor penetration agrade comes\nwith a 50% armor penetration attribute\ncombined with the wind arrow of the five\nelements arrow. It is incredibly swift\nand the feathered arrow instantly\npierces the already not so thick armor\nof the long bowman. Instant kill. Three\nvolleys of arrows rained down and more\nthan 70 long bowman perished. The long\nbowman used the swift march token again\nand frantically retreated to the rear of\nthe black flame army. However, the long\nbowman who had run nearly 100 m in an\ninstant still endured the fourth wave of\narrows. Neatly arranged, the last 25\nlong bowman died on the spot. The live\nstream room was completely silent. The\nGene family patriarch praising the\nsunless longbowman were still echoing in\ntheir ears when this scene unfolded\nbefore them, leaving everyone\nmomentarily speechless. A damn it. Black\nflames rage. Charge. Charge. Kill them\nall. Leave no survivors. The entire army\naccelerated, jogging towards Lyn Xiao's\narmy formation. After a 3-second casting\ntime, the hundred shadow lurkers also\nactivated shadow leap, instantly\nappearing beside Lin Xiao's 50 divine\narm archers, drawing their short swords\nand thrusting straight down. Seeing that\nthe shadow lurker was now close, Black\nFlame grinned maliciously, no longer\nthreatened by ranged attacks. Lyn Shao,\nyour death is near. Lyn Shao remained\ncalm and composed. In the midst of the\narmy formation, Hoitsubing led a 100\ncavalry men at full speed, heading\nstraight towards the blazing spearmen\nwhose spear tips shone with intense\nheat. You don't actually think you can\nfight against an epic cavalry killer\nwith this mediocre cavalry, do you?\nBlack Flame laughed wildly. Fierce\nSunspearman, show no mercy. In the\ncavalry formation, Hitsubing took the\nlead with Hoitzubing's drinking horse in\nthe vast sea skill granting a 50%\nmovement speed bonus and the Guan Ning\niron cavalry's charge skill. The cavalry\nregiment quickly increased its speed\nover a distance of several hundred\nmeters. Guaning Iron Cavalry charge.\nGuaning Iron Cavalry can accelerate and\ncharge over a shorter distance. Charge\ndistance minus 50%. Speed boost plus\n50%, movement speed plus 50%, and damage\nto enemies directly in front plus 50%\nwhile charging. Before anyone could\nreact, the cavalry regiment, which had\nbeen moving slowly forward, accelerated\nto a speed that was like thunder. Form\nranks, hold the line, pierce them to\ndeath. The 200 blazing lancers, who\nwould never waver in the face of\ncavalry, immediately stopped. All of\nthem stood shoulderto-shoulder with one\nend of their 3meter long lances stuck\ninto the ground and the tips pointing\ndiagonally forward. A blazing light\ncondensed at the tip of the spear like\nthe sharpest divine weapon capable of\npiercing through any invading enemy just\nwaiting for Lin Xiao's cavalry to charge\nin. With the buffs from cavalry buster,\nsun protection, and the lord's talent of\nblack flame, the sun spearman reaches\nhis peak and is confident in holding off\nthe enemy. Lin Shiao is still too young.\nGene Wuang said quietly. At this point,\nwe should use cavalry to rescue his\nGustau archers and then use the Gustau\narchers to wear down the spearman.\nThere's still a glimmer of hope. Faced\nwith the steadfast and resolute lancers\nof the blazing sun apart from the three\nmajor nightly orders, no cavalry can\nbreak through their formation. Lynhia's\ncavalry regiment is approaching. 200 m,\n100 m, 50 m, 30 m. Everyone held their\nbreath again, eager to see what the next\ncollision would be like. The knight\ngeneral at the head of the cavalry\nregiment shouted, \"Kill!\" Then he threw\nthe spear in his hand. 100 cavalrymen\nsplit into two groups and simultaneously\nraised their strangely shaped\nlong-handled iron rods, pointing the\niron end at the blazing sunsp spearman.\nBoom! Boom! Boom! Gunpowder exploded and\nrose from the ground. Amidst the massive\nplume of smoke, a large number of the\nfiery sun gunners fell to the ground.\nThe mouths of everyone in the live\nstream formed an O shape, as if they\ncould swallow an egg hole. After firing\ntheir powerful musketss at close range,\nthe frontline cavalry immediately turned\ntheir horses around, splitting into two\ngroups and retreating to the flanks.\nTheir movements were fluid and without\nthe slightest hesitation. The cavalry in\nthe rear continued to follow, their\nstrange weapons still unleashing deadly\nflames at the blazing spearman. What?\nStartled by the roar of the musketss,\nBlack Flame reacted. How come these\ncavalrymen know how to use firearms?\nIsn't this the unique skill of the\nmounted musketeers of the kingdom of\nFrance? Only the conquerors possess it.\nCould it be that Lynn Shiao has a squad\nof Frankie conquerors? Hitsubing led a\n100 Guan Ning cavalrymen charging in and\nattacking head-on. Their three-eyed\nmusketss fired three shots\nsimultaneously from a distance of 30 m,\neasily breaking through the armor. With\njust one charge and a tail sweep, he\ntook down nearly a hundred snipers who\nwere lying in weight. And the Blazing\nSunlancers didn't even manage to touch a\nhair on their heads. He the Sunfire\nSpearman is a level 30 epic unit. Based\non the average level of melee strength\nfocused units, its four stats should be\naround 110 strength, 80 spirit, 80\nconstitution, and 50 soul. and the Guan\nNing iron cavalry with Hoit Sububing's\nCavaliers command SS level granting a\n100% bonus to all attributes and sealing\nthe wolf's lair adding 50% damage to\nforeign enemies and Guan Ning iron\ncavalry's charge adding 50% damage to\nenemies in front and breaking formation\nadding 50% critical hit bonus to enemies\nin formation. The level 20 Guan Ning\niron cavalry has the following\nattributes. Strength 135 plus 135 spirit\n92 + 92 constitution 110 + 110 soul 53 +\n53 damage plus 100% critical hit plus\n50%. In addition, with the Emperor's\nLuck skill bonus that I'm currently\npossessing, my critical hit rate can\nalmost reach 100%. against the blazing\nsunsp spearman. It's an instant kill. I\nreally don't know what black flame has\nthat gives it the confidence to stop the\nGuan Ning iron cavalry. Lynn Shiao, the\ntop student, nodded secretly. His\nexpertise and calculation had already\nled him to deduce everything. After the\nGuan Ning cavalry finished firing their\nmusketss at point blank range, they\nsplit into two groups and circled around\nto the flanks. Without reloading, they\ndrew their long swords and charged at\nthe archers. This is Lin Xiao's cavalry\ntrying to relieve his archers. Everyone\nin the live stream understood. Lin Shiao\nisn't too bad. At least he knows how to\nuse cavalry to relieve the archers. Jin\nWuang said, \"It's a bit slow, but at\nleast we can preserve some bows.\" Wait,\nwhy are none of Lyn Xiao's archers dead?\nHave the shadow lurkers already fallen?\nChapter 117. Iron Guards of the Mo Dao\nversus Templar Knights. The audience in\nthe live stream turned to look at the\nsource of the sound. The archers, whom\nLin Shao called the Gust Archers, were\nsurrounded by the shadow lurkers. He\nimmediately abandoned the use of the\ngiant crossbow and instead drew a thick,\nlong, sharp blade from his waist. Faced\nwith the assassins who came close by,\nthese tall archers remained calm and\ninstead showed friendly smiles. The\nshadow lurker was taken aback. This\ndoesn't seem like the reaction of a weak\nranged attacker seeing itself get close.\nWith a snap, the archer gust lowered the\nheavy circular iron flaps on his helmet\ncovering his face and neck. From then\non, these archers were completely\ncovered from head to toe with only a\nslit between their eyes. The rest of\ntheir bodies were completely sealed off,\nleaving no openings. Gustee the archer\ngrabbed his ring pommel sword and swung\nit down with a swift powerful strike.\nless than 10 m away from the archer, the\narcher's strength and constitution\nattributes increase by 30% and melee\nability increases by 30%. Some shadowy\nfigures who didn't react in time were\nunable to dodge and died on the spot.\nThe divine arm archer is a powerful man\nwhose strength rivals that of the iron\nguards of the Mod Dao. As a legendary\ngold tier unit, he wears 60 lb infantry\narmor and wields a ring pommel sword.\nWith the composure buff, his close\ncombat prowess against squishy assassins\nis comparable to that of a tanky\nwarrior, making it a piece of cake. The\nGuan Ning cavalry, who had just\nshattered the Blazing Sun Spearmen, had\nnot yet arrived. This group of fierce\nmen fought two against one with 50\narchers taking on a 100 shadow lurkers\nand instead killing the assassins who\ngot close making them cry for their\nmothers. The live stream audience was\nshocked. Lyn Sha has brought far too\nmany shocks. This this Jean Wuwang\nstammered. Is this the skill of the\noveralls archer? No. Is this the skill\nof the gust archer? Its range is even\ngreater than that of the epic archer,\nthe sunless long bowman, and it can\neasily defeat epic quality assassins in\nmelee combat. Oh my god. Oh my god. I\nshould have made my phantom archers\nalways wear overalls. Everyone exclaimed\nin surprise. Ancestor of the Gene\nfamily. You made the phantom archer wear\noveralls. Gene Wuang, of course. But\nunfortunately, I was ridiculed by those\nold geysers, so I gave up and waited.\nWhy are you asking about this? Everyone\nfell silent. Gene Wuang changed the\nsubject. Lyn Sha has really brought me\ntoo many surprises. The Gust Archer is\nso powerful. Could it be an epic unit?\nEpic units? Someone in the live stream\nexclaimed in shock. Lyn Sha actually\ncreated an epic unit. They still\nremember that after the Gust Archer made\nhis first appearance and killed the\nenemy, someone went to look up the\ndictionary of battlefield of all races.\nBut there was no entry for this type of\nunit. It can only be classified as a\ntype of troop created by Lin Sha.\nCreating one's own unit type is\nconsidered one of the characteristics of\na genius. And his cavalry can actually\noperate musketss. That's a legendary\ngold tier unit. The special skill of the\nFrankie conqueror, ancestor of the Gene\nfamily. Are Lyn Xiao's cavalry the\nFrankish conquerors? No. I have seen the\nconquerors of Frangic. They did not\ncarry long swords or spears, nor did\nthey move with such speed. Could it be?\nCould it be something? Could this be\nanother unit created by Lynn Shiao like\nthe Gust Archers? This another\nself-created unit. The live stream chat\nexploded. How long has it been since you\ncreated the Gust Archers? 10 days. And\nnow you've created a new cavalry and it\nlooks so powerful. Genius. Absolutely a\ngenius. Lyn Sha is awesome. Sh. Keep\nyour voice down. The battle isn't over\nyet. If you cheer for Lyn Sha, Black\nFlame might come after you. Damn it.\nDamn it, Lyn Sha. You really deserve to\ndie. As the smoke from the three-eyed\nmusket dissipated, black flame saw\nnearly half of his fallen sun spearman,\nas well as the shadow lurkers being\nbesieged by the divine arm archers and\nthe Guan Ning iron cavalry. You force me\nto this, I'll grind you to dust. Black\nFlame shouted, \"Rom, go!\" The blonde\nblue-eyed knight commander rode slowly\npast Black Flame, coldly, saying,\n\"Chinese, watch your words.\" Black Flame\nwas immediately discouraged and\nwhispered, \"Commander Rohm, please\nstrike and kill this scoundrel.\"\n\"Snort!\" Rahm snorted coldly and led a\n100 Templar knights, accelerating from\nthe rear of the army formation. The Iron\nWall Crusaders and the remaining Sunfire\nSpearmen in the central camp immediately\nparted to make way for the Templars. On\nthe opposite side, archers and Guan Ning\ncavalry are killing the shadow lurkers.\nAt this moment, Lyn Shao only had the\nMod Dao iron guard in his hands. The\nheavy footsteps of the Knights Templar\nsounded and the order began to speed up.\nLook, Black Flame has dispatched the\nKnights Templar directly, intending to\ndeliver the final blow. The viewers in\nthe live stream exclaimed in surprise.\nHe kept the Sunfire Spearman and Iron\nWall Crusaders close behind, trying to\ncatch up with the Templar formation and\nexpand his gains. With the Templar\nKnights arrival, the outcome is already\ndecided. Some people also raised\nobjections. But the Templar Knights only\nhave two or 300 m to charge. Can they\neven make it that far? You idiot. That's\na legendary gold tier unit, one of the\nthree great nightly orders of Europe.\nEven if they can't reach top speed, the\nbeast steeds and plate armored knights\ncan easily slaughter all of Linia's men.\nWhere is Lin Shiao? How is Lin Shiao\nresponding? From within Lyn Xiao's army\nformation, 50 soldiers nearly 2 meters\ntall, wearing two layers of heavy armor,\nand with their faces covered by\nferocious iron masks, stepped out. They\nwere tall and imposing, exuding a fierce\naura. Each wielded a 3 m long giant\nsword with a blade alone measuring 1.5\nm. They stood in neat formation facing\nthe Templar knights. It looks pretty\ngood, but is it just for shell? Ancestor\nof the Gene family? Are you familiar\nwith this type of soldier? Cough. Cough.\nI don't recognize him. Gene Wuang seemed\nslightly embarrassed. Lynho&lt;unk&gt;s troops\nare too peculiar. Ancestor, do you think\nLyn Shao can win? Liao&lt;unk&gt;s troops look\nvery imposing. Gene Wuang, he he even a\n4 m tall cyclops can be easily killed by\nTemplar knights without them charging.\nLynho&lt;unk&gt;s troops are like a mantis\ntrying to stop a chariot. The power of\nthe legendary golden units is beyond\nyour imagination. The words had barely\nleft his mouth when the Templar knights,\nwho had already begun to accelerate,\nrushed in front of Lin Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s\ntroops. The entire Nightly Order seemed\nto merge into one. Each person radiating\na faint golden light. The Nightly Order\nlike a sharp sword slashing at the\nenemy. The Templar Knights leader was\nnone other than the legendary golden\nhero, Commander Rom. Rohm, lance in\nhand, roared, and a thousand rays of\nlight gathered on him and then on his\nlance. The entire nightly order charged\ntoward the enemy with boundless power.\nEveryone stared wideeyed and held their\nbreath. Suddenly, a white figure flashed\npast among Lin Xiao's 50 soldiers. Then\na dazzling white light flashed, trailing\nbrilliant light, overshadowing the\nradiance of the entire Knight Commander\nRome, and disappeared in a flash. Rum\nwas instantly defeated. Clashed with the\ntowering troop formation that was\nadvancing instead of retreating. Cut. A\nloud shout rang out. Chapter 118. Melee\nstalemate. Cullinans Iron Cavalry. Cut.\nA loud shout rang out. The Templars\nsimultaneously thrust out their lances.\nAll the tall, sword wielding soldiers\nformed a dense formation and\nsimultaneously brandished their giant\nblades. When their lances clashed with\nthe towering soldiers, their massive\nblades also struck the Templar knights.\nThe weapons of both sides clashed with\neach other's armor, producing a loud\nbang. The Templar Knights, who were\nalready not at their full potential,\nslowed down even further after their\ncommander fall. Their iron tipped wooden\nlances did not penetrate the armor of\nthe tall soldiers. They merely knock\nthem back a few steps. Click. Most of\nthe lances fired in the first wave of\nthe attack broke. At the same time, the\nentire Templar Order's charge was also\nabruptly halted. The towering soldiers\nwielded their massive blades\nsimultaneously slicing sparks from the\nTemplar knight's armor and their\nwarhor's armor. What? This type of\nsoldier doesn't even try to avoid the\nenemy. They just go for a head-on\nconfrontation. They actually held on.\nThe audience in the live stream was\nstunned. Just then, the tall soldier\nstepped forward again and swung his\ngreat sword at the Templar knights who\nhad stopped. The Templar Knights truly\nlive up to their legendary gold rank.\nTheir reactions are swift. They\nimmediately dropped their broken lances,\nraised their shields, or drew their long\nswords to parry. When the giant blade\nstruck the Templar knights once more,\nanother burst of sparks appeared,\naccompanied by shields or long swords\nbeing cleaved in two. Everyone in the\nlive stream was completely mesmerized.\nBut before they could even marvel, the\ntall soldier who had just delivered the\nfirst slash swiftly delivered another\nslash in the blink of an eye. Snap!\nBlood splattered everywhere. More than\nhalf of the Templar knights in the first\nrow fell straight down. Even worse, the\nman and his horse were split in two.\nThere seemed to be a moment of silence\nin the air. What? What the hell? What\ndid I see? Lyn Xiao's infantry killed\nthe Templar knight. The live stream chat\nwas in an uproar. That's a Templar\nknight in full plate armor, a master of\nmelee combat, a master of defense, known\nas invincible. I think I even saw a\nWarcraft hybrid horse get killed. The\nhorse was also wearing a breastplate and\nchain mail, and it too was cut in two.\nMy god, what's going on? Am I\nhallucinating? Ancestor of the Gene\nfamily, come out and explain yourself.\nOn the battlefield, black flame stood\nmotionless, trembling all over. The\nTemplar knights were killed. Are there\nstill infantrymen in this world capable\nof defeating the Templars? Years of\ncombat experience and understanding were\nshattered. Black Flame even forgot what\nhe was doing and gave no further\ninstructions. He just stood there\nwatching the iron guards of the Mod Dao\nswing their Mod Dao again and continued\nto advance, slashing at the Templar\nKnights. Asel. A loud shout rang out and\nthe fallen knight commander Rom\nscrambled to his feet. His left shoulder\narmor was shattered and blood seeped\nfrom his shoulder. How dare you harm a\nnoble Templar knight? How dare you harm\na nobleman? Who attacked me? Step\nforward. I challenge you to a duel.\nBlack Flame was instantly awakened by\nRahm's shout. He hasn't lost yet. He\nlooked around and then glanced at the\nlive stream. The Templar Knights were\nonly intercepted. More than a dozen of\nthe first rank of charging knights were\nkilled, but they have now begun an\neffective counterattack. At such close\nrange, the taller soldiers are no longer\nable to quickly kill the Templar\nknights. The Templars, relying on their\nwar horses, lances, long swords, and\nshields were already locked in battle\nwith the towering infantry, still\nholding an overwhelming numerical\nadvantage. Night Commander Ram is only\ninjured. He is a legendary gold tier\nhero and he still has the strength to\nfight. He also has 100 fiery sun\nspearmen and 300 fully equipped iron\nwall crusaders which are one of the\nstrongest offensive and defensive units\ncapable of overcoming fortifications.\nExecutioners and mountain savages that I\nfirst sent out to raid Lyn Xiao's rear\nhave successfully descended the mountain\nand entered the Calabash Valley. Their\nhero Nano along with 200 dwarven\nmountain warriors had caught up with the\nbeautiful girl and the phantom archer\ncornering them on the edge of a cliff.\nDingle is leading over a thousand\nsoldiers and is heading this way. They\nshould arrive in 2 minutes at most. As\nfor Chufunga and the others, they never\nreappeared after escaping, having\nalready disengaged from the battle. No\nmatter how you look at it, you still\nhave an absolute advantage. He was only\ntemporarily panicked because of the\nsudden loss of the Knights Templar.\nHaving calmed down, Black Flame\nimmediately made arrangements. His years\nof combat experience allowed him to make\narrangements that best suited the\ncurrent situation. Dingle, what are you\ndoawling about? Charge forward and\nsurround Lin Shiao. Neagano, lead your\ndwarf mountain warriors. Surround and\nannihilate the beautiful girl and\nimmediately infiltrate Lyn Xiao's rear\nand flatten his lord's mansion. Sword\nSaint Wuji, make your move immediately.\nLyn Shiao must have sent that whiteclad\nhero to ambush and wound, breaking the\nTemplar knight's charge. Find him\nimmediately and kill him. Yes, sir. The\ntall, slender swordsman, wearing a\nseveneyed visor received the order. He\nlooked up and the visor traced the\nbattle's trajectory. Not far from where\nthe dazzling streak of light had just\npassed, a man in white was quietly\nwaiting for him. The sword saint of\nLimitless immediately used his movement\ntechnique to rush over. Blazing\nspearman, ironclad crusaders, follow me\nforward and slay all enemies. Black\nFlame dawned his helmet and led the\nremaining 100 Sunfire Spearmen and 300\nIron Wall Crusaders forward to join the\nTemplar Knights battle line and besieged\nthe mere 50 Ironclad guards. The battle\nimmediately became intense. The viewers\nin the live stream were once again\namazed. The great battle. Black Flame\nhas committed all its forces. Can Lynn\nShia hold out? The Lord of the official\ndistrict is quite capable. He made\narrangements immediately. He he wasn't\nfor nothing that I sneaked out here.\nBrilliant. Brilliant. Gene Wuang\nexclaimed in admiration. Despite the\nTemplar knight's setback, Black Flame\nstill holds an absolute advantage. He's\noperating on three fronts. On the main\nbattlefield, his forces are almost five\ntimes that of Lin Xiao, and they're all\nlevel 30 epic legendary units. Behind\nDinglay are more than a thousand rare\nand outstanding reserve troops. Even if\nyou just pile them up, you can still\nkill Lin Shiao. Lyn Xiao's most powerful\nwhiteclad hero was also killed by the\nWuji Sword Saint. On the flank, the big-\nbreasted girl has been driven to a dead\nend and is destined to be killed. On the\nrear battlefield, the mountain savages\nhave already entered Lin Xiao's rear and\ncan burn, kill, and plunder all the way,\ndisturbing Lin Shiao. Finally, the\nflanking and rear battlefields were\ncombined into one, and Lin Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s\nstronghold was wiped out. What a pity.\nGene Wuang side. Lyn Shiao is really\ngood, far exceeding my expectations. If\nhe doesn't die, he'll inevitably grow\ninto a powerful ruler in the future. All\nright. Although Lin Sha will eventually\ndie, I cannot leave empty-handed from\nthis great battle. to everyone's\nsurprise in the live stream. Gene Wuang\nsuddenly spoke in the chat channel at\nLin Shiao. I think your self-created\ncavalry unit is quite good. What is it\ncalled? How do you train it? Everyone,\nat this point, they still have the mood\nto reply to you. So, when you say you\ncan't leave empty-handed, you mean you\nwant to get their troops for free?\nUnexpectedly, Lin Sha actually replied,\n\"Is this the ancestor of Gene Dang? My\ncavalry is called the Cullinan Iron\nCavalry. As for how to train, I'll tell\nyou after I've killed the black flame,\nthe Mod Dao iron guard who was fighting\nagainst the tide of enemies alone. He\nwas going to the battlefield to fight\nalongside the iron guards of the Mod\nDao. Lyn Shao swung his long sword. A\nmeteorite fell from the sky. Chapter\n119. What is the king of the mountains?\nJust as Lin Sha brandished his long\nsword and slowly walked towards the\nbattlefield. as the meteorite fell from\nthe sky and landed within the black\nflame army's formation. In the live\nstream, some viewers saw from Tu Shawn\nby Chin's perspective that the dwarf\nmountain warriors had completely\nsurrounded the remaining soldiers of the\nbeautiful girls on a cliff, leaving them\nwith no way to escape. Among the dwarf\nmountain warriors, a muscular black hero\nwielding two single-edged axes grinned\nas he cleaved down at two Shawn by\nChien. The pretty girl and the others\nare in danger when a loud bang was heard\nand Chun Ningming rushed out from the\nside, blocking the attack with his black\nwind ax. But how could Chin Ningming\npossibly match power, the black wind axe\nimmediately flew out of his hand, and\nChin Ningming was also knocked dozens of\nmeters away. Shooting at Soldering's\ncommand, the phantom archer activated\nthe rapid fire skill. Nearly 50 phantom\narchers fired arrows in rapid\nsuccession. Some aimed at the black hero\nand some at the dwarf mountain warriors\nsurrounding them. rolled away to avoid\nit, followed by a clanging sound. 200\ndwarf mountain warriors, each less than\n1.5 meters tall but 1.5 meters wide,\nshort, stocky, and fully armored. Each\nwielding a shield in one hand and a\nspear in the other, raised their shields\nto defend themselves, blocking all the\narrows. The phantom archer couldn't\nbreak through the defenses of the\ndwarven mountain warrior. Hey, don't eat\nthe pickled radish. Seeing this,\nSoldering could only curse angrily. The\ndwarf mountain warriors, shields in\nhand, slowly advanced while Tu Shan by\nChin's remaining troops could only\nretreat continuously. Die. Nanu leaped\nup again and swung his ax at Chening. Tu\nShan by Chin transformed into a fox\ndemon, snatched the unconscious Chun\nNingming, and led all the troops in a\nretreat once more. Behind them was a\nsheer cliff. This is really the end. The\nless than 100 of the beautiful girls\nremaining troops are no match for epic\nlevel units. There's nowhere to run.\nIt's a dead end. The audience in the\nlive stream side. Lyn Shia made a\nmistake. He shouldn't have come to save\nZay May and the others. They're just\nvassel lords and their strength isn't\nthat great. And all those phantom\narchers and faceless men were wasted.\nCould it really be that he's just after\nthe girl's beauty? What a pity. Zay was\nquite a beauty in the making. She was\nsweetl looking, had a great figure, was\nintelligent, and could even transform\ninto a demon beast. She had so many\ntricks up her sleeve. My friend, your\ntaste is a bit too extreme. Hey, I can\nsee you talking about me like that. Tan\nby Chin shouted in the live stream. It's\nnot gentlemanly to comment on a lady's\nbehavior to her face. He a dear young\nlady, what time is it? You still have\nthe mood to argue. At this moment,\nsomeone exclaimed, \"Look, what's that?\"\nSuddenly, a white spear appeared from\nthe cliff behind Tu Shawn by Chen, where\nthere was nowhere left to retreat. The\nwhite spear had a strange shape with a\nlong and sharp tip, and below the tip\nwas a barb that looked like a sickle.\nThe spear extends out and then hangs\ndown. The barb was firmly hooked onto\nthe cliff face. One, two, or several\nwhite spears stretched out\nsimultaneously, hanging on the cliff.\nThen a soldier with dark skin and\nprominent features suddenly climbed up\nthe white spear and jumped up. One, two,\ndozens of soldiers jumped up one after\nanother. These soldiers wore half-body\narmor to protect their upper bodies,\ngators to protect their shins, and\ngauntlets to protect their forearms,\nrevealing two muscular arms. Heavy\nswords hung at their waists, and their\neyes were fierce and filled with\nmurderous intent. This is This is the\nreinforcements sent by Lin Sha. Lyn Sha\nactually had a backup plan. Someone in\nhappening. How did they get up here? How\ncan infantrymen climb up cliffs? Are\nthey even human? This cliff in the\nCalabash Mountains is so steep, it's as\nif it were cut by a knife and axe,\nreaching a height of 4 or 500 m. Aside\nfrom flying units, no one can climb it.\nYet today, a unit actually managed to\nclimb it up. This has truly broadened\nthe horizons of everyone in the live\nstream. In their astonishment, even Gano\nforgot to attack. 50 Fierce soldiers\nclimbed to the top of the cliff in just\nover 10 seconds. The last soldier to\ncome up picked up the long spears\nhanging on the edge of the cliff, and\nthe troops were assembled. A female hero\nclad in silver scale armor with a\nflowing crimson cape and long hair tied\nin a high ponytail reaching her waist\nleaped forward and landed in front of\nthe white spearman. Lynhia's mountain\ntroops have been assembled. The female\nhero is heroic and awe inspiring. Her\nfeatures were delicate with small rosy\nlips and a high nose that accentuated\nthe three-dimensionality of her\nfeatures. Her face, eyes, eyebrows,\nnose, and mouth. Every single one of\nthem was extremely beautiful. But the\ncombination of these qualities on her\nexudes a vigorous and heroic spirit,\nmaking people overlook her beauty and\nonly feel that she is unstoppable. Wow,\nwhat a beautiful heroine. I have never\nseen such a beautiful woman in my life.\nMy conqueror's spirit is burning. A\ngroup of people in the live stream\nexclaimed in amazement that Lynn Shiao\nis really lucky with women. He actually\nhas such a beautiful heroine by his\nside. I don't think those dozens of\nflower fairies of that weak man are\nappealing anymore. He a I'm also in the\nlive stream so watch your words. The\ncrowd ignored him and continued their\nfrantic discussion. And this beautiful\nheroine looks to be quite powerful in\ncombat as well. Sister, please attack me\nhead on. Hey, control yourself. Do you\nguys think this might be the beautiful\nheroin that Lynn Sha rewarded? That\nmakes sense. So, this is the beautiful\nheroine the system called out. Ahem,\nyou've got the point wrong. Seeing that\nthe topic had shifted, Gene Wuang said\nhelplessly. The battle is still going\non. This reinforcement only consists of\n50 men and one hero, while the enemy has\n200 epic level units. In my opinion,\nthis beautiful heroine is also here to\ndie. It was only then that everyone\nrealized how beautiful Chin Leong Yu\nwas. Look, they started fighting on the\ncliff. Chin Leong Yu with 50 white spear\nsoldiers shielded the wounded Tu Sha by\nChin and the others behind her without\nsaying a word. Leave the rest to me.\nChin Leang Yu smiled, leaving Tu Sha by\nChin stunned. What a beautiful woman.\nWhen did boss Lynn Shia acquire another\nbeautiful lady? He's really lucky. While\ntwo Shan by Chian was lost in thought,\nChin Leangu shouted. Fighting, the white\nshafted spearmen immediately lined up\nand advanced, their spears pointing\nstraight ahead. Seeing that the\nnewcomers were hostile, Gano immediately\nled his dwarf mountain warriors into\nformation, their spears standing tall\nand pointing forward. You think you can\nfight the mountain king dwarf on the\nmountains? You're so naive. Kill.\nWithout any preamble, 50 against 200.\nChin Leong Yu versus Nagant. A head-on\nconfrontation. The two sides clashed.\nBoom. Snap. Was pierced through by a\ngroup of spearmen who appeared out of\nnowhere. The White Pole spearmen have\nlonger spears and can wield them with\nboth hands, making them more agile.\nCombined with the high attributes of the\ngolden legendary unit and the bonus from\nChin Leong Yu, they can decide the\noutcome of a battle in one strike. Chin\nLeong Yu, Spearman Command, Srank,\nArcher Command, Srank. All spearmen and\narchers have their four attributes\nincreased by 50%. King of the Mountains.\nWhen leading troops in mountain marches\nand battles, Chin Leong Yu and all troop\ntypes gain 50% increased attack speed\nand movement speed. Stamina consumption\nfor traversing mountains is reduced by\n50% and endurance is increased by 100%.\nCritical hit rate is increased by 50%\nand damage is increased by 30%.\nUnaffected by any ambushes or traps\nbelow SS level in the mountains. Whoosh.\nThe Phantom Archer seized the\nopportunity to fire again. This time\nwith a faster and more powerful arrow.\nThis time, the arrows broke through the\ndefenses of the dwarven mountain\nwarriors, causing considerable chaos in\nthe dwarven army. Seeing the dwarves\nbeing slaughtered one-sidedly by the\nwhite-barreled spearmen and phantom\narchers, Neagano, as strong as a\ngorilla, roared and swung his\nsingle-edged ax at Chin Leang Yu. A\nbarbaric small country full of tales of\ngods and ghosts. A bunch of dwarfs dared\nto call themselves the kings of the\nmountains. Chin Leang Yu snorted coldly,\nactivated master of spear technique, and\nwent to meet the attack. In less than 10\nseconds, Nanu was stabbed to death by\nChin Leong Yu on mountainous terrain.\nChin Leong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s attack capabilities\nare comparable to Pay Mins. The White\nSpear soldiers and phantom archers\npressed their advantage, quickly\neliminating the remaining troops. Before\nanyone in the live stream could react,\nthe camera was turned off. The battle on\nthe mountaintop is over. Chapter 12.\nValiant Iron Guard Grand Magister. Here,\nLynn Shao drew his Crimson Sky sword and\njoined the bloody battle between the\niron guards of the Mod Dao and the Black\nFlame soldiers. The sudden appearance of\nthe meteorite startled Black Flame.\nHaving fought in the official zone for\nmany years, he subconsciously assumed\nthat a highle mage had joined Lin Shia\nand released a meteor spell.\nFortunately, it was just a meteorite,\nwhich only killed a dozen or so\ncrusaders. Thank goodness it wasn't a\nmeteor summoned by the Arch Mitch. This\nkind of highle magic is over level 30,\nso it's impossible for it to appear in\nthe beginner area. Black Flame quickly\ncalmed down, determined to surround and\nkill Lin Sha. The Iron Guards wielding\ntheir legendary swords were incredibly\nbrave and formed a formidable human wall\nof defense. Beneath the flashing blades,\nTemplar knights fell to the ground with\nscreams of agony. However, the Templar's\nattacks also inflicted damage on the\niron guards of the Emo Dao Modal. Their\nlances and long swords cleaving through\ntheir scale armor. Fortunately, the\nsecond layer of chain mail blocked most\nof the damage. And so far, none of the\nMod Dao iron guards have been killed or\nseriously injured. They are still\npersevering despite bleeding. Quickly\ncharge. Kill these damned soldiers.\nBlack Flame roared from within the Iron\nWall Crusade. Lyn Shiao, you're dead. My\nsheer numbers can overwhelm you. Then\nyou'll see how you've utterly failed.\nLyn Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s eyes were cold as he\ncharged into the Templar Knights and\njoined the bloody battle. At this\nmoment, due to Liao&lt;unk&gt;s arrival, the\nMod Dao Iron Guards activated their\nskills one after another. Blood frenzy.\nWhen a unit bleeds, it triggers a\nberserk state. immediately increase\nstrength, spirit, and constitution by\n30% lasting until the end of the battle.\nFurthermore, as injuries worsen, the\nberserk state bonus will continue to\nincrease up to a maximum of 100%\nincrease for all three attributes.\nHeroic, the iron guards of the mo down\nnever retreat. The more enemies they\nface, the stronger their will becomes.\nwhen the number of enemies exceeds five\ntimes the number of MO DAO iron guards\nincreasing maximum health by 5% and so\non up to a maximum increase of 100% of\nmaximum health. The life value of the MO\nDAO Ironclad increases by nearly 80%.\nPillar of strength when facing a\nsuperior enemy with a combat strength\nrating close to or exceeding that of\nyour own increases morale and strength,\nspirit and constitution. The greater the\nnumber of enemies, the more morale,\nstrength, and constitution are\nincreased. This effect is doubled when\nprotecting your lord and heroes. Facing\nan enemy force more than 10 times the\nsize of the Modo Dao Iron Guards, the\nMod Dao iron guard's attributes\nincreased by 100%. Because of protecting\nLin Sha, the Mod Dao iron guards\nadditional attributes increased by 200%.\nFirst, the divine valor skill greatly\nincreases the HP of the Mod Dao\nironclad, allowing it to withstand more\ndamage. Furthermore, the injured Emo Dao\niron guards blood frenzy greatly\nincreases their attack power.\nFurthermore, under the pillar of\nstrength state, the four main attributes\nare greatly increased when fighting\nagainst a larger force. The iron guards\nof the Mod Dao, who had been on the\nverge of collapse from the Templar\nKnights onslaught, suddenly straightened\nup and launched a fearless\ncounterattack. Swish, swish. Of the long\nsword flashed continuously, and another\nrow of Templar knights fell. What?\nSeeing the iron guards of the Mode Dao\ncharging at his Templar knights as if\nthey were on steroids, Black Flame was\nextremely anxious. Sunfire Spearman,\nCrusaders, quick charge. Pierce them.\nSlash them. The blazing spearmen had\nalready circled around to the rear of\nthe Emo Dao Iron Guards formation,\nthrusting their scorching spears into\nthe armor of the Mod Dao iron guards. A\nwisp of white smoke rose out. It truly\nlived up to its reputation as a skill\nthat gathered the power of the sun. The\niron wall crusaders have also arrived\nand dual sword style is activated.\nCrack. Crack. Two consecutive slashes\ncame down. One of the Mod Dao Iron\nGuards shattered instantly and the\nCrusader s broadsword became stuck in\nthe Mod Dao iron guard's body. Roar. The\nIron Guardian in pain turned and swept\nhis sword, cleaving the iron wall\ncrusader in two. Smooth slash activated.\nAnother sweeping strike followed. He\nthen hacked to death the other two Iron\nWall Crusaders and one Sunfire Spearman\nwho had arrived. He was stabbed twice\nand killed four people. But more\nironclad crusaders and sunfire spearmen\ncontinued forward once again surrounding\nand attacking the outnumbered ironclad\nguards. Seeing the fierce fighting\nspirit of the Mod Dao iron guards and\ntheir heroic figures as they\nrelentlessly killed enemies despite\nbeing outnumbered, some viewers in the\nlive stream began to murmur, \"Lynhiao's\nweapons are too powerful. How can they\nalso use dual swords? And even if you\nkill the enemy instantly, you can still\nget in two hits. Someone corrected. It's\nnot just that. I just saw the Templar\nKnight block one of the swordsman's\nblows, and he'll be hit by a second one\nright away. If the second strike kills\nthe Templar Knight, the swordsman will\nimmediately strike again. This isn't\ndual wielding. I'd call it three\nwielding. Three strikes. My god, that's\ntoo powerful. No wonder even the Templar\nknights couldn't withstand it. What kind\nof monster soldiers did Lynn Sha\nrecruit? Alas, even the most powerful\ntroops eventually run out of strength.\nGene Wuang said, \"I observe that\nalthough the soldiers morale was boosted\nagain by Lyn Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s arrival, the\nBlack Flame troops are not weak either.\nIf this stalemate continues, Black Flame\nwill eventually prevail. Ancestor of the\nGene family, you've made several\npredictions today. When have you ever\nsucceeded?\" Someone said sarcastically.\nThe battlefield is everchanging.\nAlthough I made some mistakes in the\npast, and I admit that Lynn Sha\nsurprised me one after another, but in\nthe current situation, do you yourselves\nthink Lynn Sha can win? Everyone fell\nsilent. Faced with overwhelming\nnumerical superiority, Lyn Sha had no\nchance of winning. Just then, the sky\nchanged dramatically, and another\nmeteorite fell from the sky. Boom! The\nmeteorite crashed straight into the\ncenter of the black flames army. More\nthan a dozen Iron Wall crusaders were\nblown into the air. What's going on? Why\nare meteorites falling suddenly during a\nbattle? The viewers in the live stream\nwere puzzled. Boom. Another meteorite\nfell. Before the meteorite even hit the\nground, the clouds parted and another\nmeteorite poured down. Boom. Several\nmeteorites crashed into the black flame\nlegion. Black flames suffered heavy\nlosses immediately. What the hell? Black\nflames screamed in agony. Scatter\neveryone. Scatter. Don't be so crowded.\nDamn. Why is it raining meteors at this\ntime? Damn it. Why are they only hitting\nme and not Lyn Sha? The meteorites\nstruck with great precision, landing\nprecisely in the area where the black\nflame troops were most concentrated. The\npower released during the fall did not\naffect Lin Xiao's troops in the\nslightest. Lynn Shiao used the Crimson\nSky Sword to kill another Templar\nknight. Seeing this, he couldn't help\nbut laugh out loud. Today, I'll show you\nthe power of a Grand Magister. Grand\nMagister? There are no Grand Magisters\nhere. Stop trying to confuse me. Lyn Sha\ndidn't waste any words and continued to\nfight alongside the iron guards of the\nMod Dao. In the sky, another meteorite\ntrailing a long fiery tail hurdled\nstraight down. Dinglay, you bastard. Why\naren't you up here yet? Blackflame\nshouted. I'll go after I've taken down\nall the blood lords. Suddenly, Dinglay\nreplied, \"What?\" Blackflame quickly\nglanced at the live stream. From Ding\nLays perspective, the ground was\nlittered with corpses and rivers of\nblood. Ding Lay and his troops are\nengaged in a bloody battle with all the\nother blood lords. Chapter 121. Lynn,\nGrand Magister, child of the plains,\nSha. Dinglay, how dare you betray me?\nBlack Flame was instantly enraged. Our\ncelestial being organization valued you\nso highly. We gave you money and\nmilitary tokens, and you actually\nbetrayed us. Huh? You still have the\nnerve to talk about betrayal? As Ding\nLay drew his sword and fought fiercely\nagainst the bloodthirsty Lord before\nhim, he shouted, \"I've been in a\ncooperative relationship with you from\nthe very beginning. I never agreed to be\none of your peripheral members. Besides,\nyour cooperation wasn't based on the\nintention of using me as a tool, was it?\nI don't get along with Lyn Shia, but I'm\ngoing to defeat him fair and square. I\nwant to kill the bloodthirsty lord, and\nI want to create a peaceful and\nharmonious environment for the newbie\nzone. It's all true. And what about you?\nYou actually provided me with\ninformation on those worthless\nbloodthirsty lords, using me to\neliminate them while secretly\ncultivating even more bloodthirsty\nlords. I am the one who has been\nmanipulated by you. With a whoosh, Ding\nlay cleaved the bloodthirsty lord before\nhim to death, roaring. I've lived my\nwhole life on thin ice. Tell me, how\ncould I possibly associate with you\nbloodthirsty lords? Okay. Okay. Black\nFlame enraged laughed. Someone like you\nwho was defeated by Lin Shiao in a\nsingle move dares to challenge the\nauthority of the Celestials. You\nunderestimate us. Black Flame remained\ncalm and indifferent, saying, \"Everyone,\nwhoever beheads Ding Lelay will be\npromoted to a full member of my\ncelestial being organization, regardless\nof past achievements.\" The bloodthirsty\nlords were stunned for a few seconds.\nThen howling wildly, he led his troops\nto charge towards Ding Lay. Seven or 800\ntroops besieged Ding Lays 300 troops.\nDing&lt;unk&gt;s eyes narrowed. Ding Lay, an\ninsignificant newbie lord, can be\ncrushed with a flick of the wrist. Boom!\nAnother meteorite has fallen. Black\nFlame hurriedly dodged, narrowly\navoiding being hit by the meteorite.\n\"Holy crap!\" Black Flame, covered in\nsoot and grime, was furious. What\nexactly happened? Lyn Sha sneered as he\nhacked at the enemy soldiers in front of\nhim. Black Flame, you still have the\nleisure to worry about others. Go check\non your own hero first. What? Which hero\nis it? Black Flame turned his head in\nsurprise. Not far away, the Templar\nKnights Commander Rum was engaged in a\none-on-one duel with the golden armored\ngeneral who had just led the Lynch\nknights in their charge. It seems that\nthe two sides are evenly matched.\nTurning around again, Wuji Sword Saint\nMaster E was dueling with Lin Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s\nwhite-clad hero. Master E was already\ncovered in sweat, his hands holding the\nsword trembling uncontrollably, while\nthe hero in white remained calm and\ncomposed, his hands even clasped behind\nhis back. Who exactly are you? I, the\nsword saint of Limitless, do not slay\nnameless ghosts. Master Yi&lt;unk&gt;s voice\ntrembled slightly. I'm just a wandering\nswordsman. the hero in white said\ncalmly. \"All right, now I'm going to use\nmy ultimate move. Using this move, I\nhave already slain 132 heroes. If you\ncan't catch it, you die. If you can\ncatch it, I lose.\" Alpha Strike. Master\nE, wielding a long sword that gleamed\nwith green light, moved with the speed\nof the wind, unleashing a series of\nslashes at the white-clad hero that made\nit impossible to see his figure. The\nhero in white simply shook his head. I\nthought the hero who was called the Wuji\nsword saint was so powerful with a\nsword. You wasted all my time trying to\nsee your swordsmanship and this is it.\nYou dare to show off your meager skills\nbefore an expert. The ultimate path.\nLord of 10,000 swords. Faced with the\nstreak of light, the whiteclad hero\nslowly extended his palm. His index and\nmiddle fingers joined together to form a\nsword-like gesture. And then he pinched\nforward. Bite. The offensive came to an\nabrupt halt. The Wuji sword saints slash\nwas directly broken. His sword was\nactually caught between the fingers of\nthe whiteclad hero. I lost. The sword\nsaint of Wuji could only dejectedly let\ngo. His tone filled with undisguised\nsorrow. I am not worthy to be a sword\nsaint. But you can see my sword. The\nwhite-clad hero spoke proudly. The sword\nsaint of Wuji suddenly looked up. A\nstreak of light, faster and brighter\nthan his own attack, came hurtling\ntowards him. Alpha launched another\nsurprise attack. But this one move was\nhundreds or thousands of times stronger\nthan his own. The seven eyes of the\nsword saint were filled with sword\nshadows. All of them the sword\ntrajectories that captivated him. This\nis the true method of alpha strike. The\nnext instant, a streak of blood\nsplattered from his throat. With a\nsatisfied smile, the sword saint of Wuji\ncollapsed. \"Mastery!\" Black Flame\nshouted in disbelief. In the live\nstream, everyone was stunned. They still\nremember Gene Wuwangs previous\nexplanation. It's the Wuji Sword Saint\nE. This is an extremely powerful, epic\nheroes. Now, the Wuji Sword Saint, who\nhad killed 132 enemy heroes, was\nactually killed by Lin Xiao's whiteclad\nhero, Fongqing Yun, with his ultimate\nmove. Just how strong is Lin Xiao's\nwhiteclad hero? It wouldn't be an\nexaggeration to say that he's the number\none hero in one-on-one combat in the\nnewbie zone of the LN region, would it?\nPay Min, who had killed the sword saint\nof Wuji, gently placed the sword saints\nsword back on his corpse. Although we\nare rivals, I still retain the respect\ndue to his swordsman. Payman said\nsoftly. Then he walked step by step with\nhis hands behind his back toward the\nTemplar knights commander who was\nfighting Hua Sububing one-on-one. As\nRahm rode his waror, he caught a glimpse\nof the murderer who had calmly killed\nMaster walking toward him out of the\ncorner of his eye. \"Stop!\" Rahm shouted.\n\"Stop! Chinese! I am engaged in a\nglorious duel with the leader of the\nCullinan Iron Cavalry, God above. No one\nis to interfere in our battle. The\nWestern God has no say over me, the\nwandering knight of the east. Payman\nsmiled and continued walking. Shameless.\nDo you think you can outnumber us? You\nhave no sense of honor whatsoever. He\nYou're wrong. I want to fight you\noneon-one, not outnumber you. I refuse,\nRom replied without hesitation. He had\nwitnessed Pay Min effortlessly kill the\nsword saint of Limitless. The sword\nsaint of Wuji is no weaker than him in\none-on-one combat. Fighting this young\nman in white is suicidal. But I was the\none who ambushed you and knocked you off\nyour horse while we were mixed in with\nthe army. Didn't you clamor to duel me?\nAren't you a nobleman who values honor\nthe most? How can you not seek revenge?\nPayman smiled and walked closer. Now I'm\nhere. Rom stood there stunned. Stop!\nBlack Flame shouted anxiously, quickly\npushing aside the crusaders in front of\nhim and rushing towards Rahm. Whoosh! A\nsword suddenly attacked from the side\nand Black Flame quickly dodged to the\nside. He turned around and found that it\nwas Lin Sha who had bypassed the\nmilitary unit and blocked his way. The\ntwo lords of this great battle finally\nclashed in close combat. \"Lyn Sha,\nyou're dead.\" Black Flame angrily raised\nhis sword and slashed at Lin Sha. Bite.\nLyn Shao swung his hand upwards with a\nbackhand flick, and the immense force\nsent the Black Flame staggering back\nseveral steps. Lyn Xiao's combat\nstrength is so much stronger than he\nimagined. Whoosh! At the same time, a\nhuge meteorite trailing a long flame\ncrashed into the Black Flame. Black\nFlame leaped and dodged in one fluid\nmotion. Then raised the sword in the\nstone again, channeling power into his\narms and delivered a leaping slash\ntowards Lyn Sha. Bite. Lyn Sha parried\nagain, and the black flames were sent\nflying once more. His sword in the stone\nhad lost most of its power, but his own\nhands were still shaken to their core.\nHow can you be so strong? Whoosh!\nAnother huge meteorite fell from the\nsky. Black Flame dodged awkwardly once\nagain. Then it suddenly dawned on me.\nWhy does every time Lin Sha draws his\nsword, it's accompanied by falling\nmeteorites? Lyn Sha, did you sabotage\nthis meteorite? You got it right. But\nthere's no reward. Lyn Sha lunged\nforward and slashed at the black flames\nwith his sword. A flash of black flame\nappeared dozens of meters away in an\ninstant, questioning Lin Sha. Why? How\ndo you have this ability? Aren't you an\nF-rank piece of trash? Lynn Sha said\ncalmly. Yes, my lordly talent is frank.\nBut I am now also Lynn, the Grand\nMagister, the chosen one of the plains.\nShiao. Chapter 122. A hasty escape. The\ntime for black flames has come. What\nnonsense are you spouting? Stop playing\ntricks on me. I am a level 63 lord in\nthe official district. I have more\nexperience than you have. How could you\npossibly be my match? You must have used\nsome skill or item that instantly boosts\nyour combat power. It won't last long.\nBlack Flame cursed angrily and refusing\nto believe it, charged forward again,\nunleashing exquisite sword techniques\nand engaging Lyn Sha in a fierce battle.\nLyn Sha calmly responded, and the two\nfought back and forth, locked in a\nfierce and evenly matched battle.\nAlthough Black Flame was limited to\nlevel 30, at least he still had combat\nexperience. lord talents and skills and\nwas still powerful. After Lin Shao was\npossessed by the spirit of a certain\nemperor, his attributes increased\ndramatically. Furthermore, with Payman\nnearby and the added bonus of the sword\nDao aura, dealing with the black flame\nwas not a problem at all. The two sides\nexchanged blows in a short period of\ntime, having already exchanged more than\na dozen moves. Lynn Sha couldn't break\nthrough the black flames for a while,\nbut he was able to suppress them,\nthinking that it was a good way to hone\nhis skills in actual combat. Black flame\ngrew increasingly alarmed as the fight\nprogressed. He possessed a formidable\nset of exceptional armor, and the stone\nsword lent to him along with hundreds of\nbattles under his belt. Yet, he was no\nmatch for Lyn Sha. He felt that Lyn Sha\nseemed to be better at fighting than\nhim. One wound after another was added\nto the black flames body. Boom, boom,\nboom. Several more meteorites crashed\ndown, landing in the Black Flame army's\nformation, causing another significant\nloss of Black Flame troops. Even the\nTemplar commander Rahm was attacked by\nthe meteor and had to spur his horse to\ndodge. As Black Flame grew increasingly\ndisadvantaged, Payman strolled towards\nhim at a leisurely pace. Rahm shouted,\n\"China, I was ambushed and injured by\nyou. This duel is unfair. I'm waiting\nfor you to challenge me in the official\nzone. After saying that, Ram took out a\ngem, crushed it, and then turned into a\nstreak of light and disappeared. This\npayman shook his head. This was the\nfirst time he had ever seen a hero\nabandon his lord and run away. The\naudience in the live stream had almost\nbecome numb. Since Lyn Sha appeared,\nstrange things have been happening one\nafter another. The Templar Knights\ncommander, who kept talking about glory,\nwas actually scared away by Lin Xiao's\nwhite-clad hero. Remembering how he kept\nreferring to China, everyone felt\nincredibly relieved. The Templar Knights\ncommander is a gold legendary hero. Such\na highquality hero is definitely not\nsomething Black Flame can possess. The\nGene family patriarch faithfully\nfulfilled his duty of explanation. This\nmust be a hero lent to him by the\nCelestial Beings organization. And he\neven has life-saving items on him. He I\nnever expected that the Templar Knights\nDivision Commander, a renowned legendary\nhero, would be so frightened by an\nunknown hero from the newbie zone that\nhe fled in panic. When I meet those\nlords in Western Europe, I must give\nthem a good slap on the shoulder. He\nGene Wooang burst into laughter,\nseemingly releasing a long suppressed\npentup frustration. Stop laughing,\nancestor of the Gene family. Look at the\nsituation on the battlefield. From the\nlive streams perspective after Rom\nescaped, the archer withdrew his sword\nand fell, killing the last shadow\nlurker. It's so refreshing to stretch\nyour muscles occasionally. Song Rui\nnodded to Lieng Long, the squad leader\nof the Guan Ning iron cavalry, who came\nto provide support, put away his\nbloodstained ring pommel sword, and\nslowly unloaded the giant crossbow from\nhis back. A collapse. All the archers\nsimultaneously lowered their giant\ncrossbows and stomped on them. Whating\nalso raised the brianac he had borrowed\nfrom Chin Leongu and shouted, \"Gather!\"\nThe sound of hooves thundered as the\nGuan Ning iron cavalry quickly formed\nranks. Preparation. The Guan Ning\ncavalry formed a formation and began to\nslowly accelerate. With the divine\ncrossbow raised his massive crossbow and\naimed it at the legion of black flames.\nPut charge. Two commands rang out\nsimultaneously.\n100 Guan Ning cavalrymen formed a swift\nand powerful torrent, swooping down once\nagain. The archer with the sharpshooter\npulled the trigger and arrows rained\ndown, instantly piercing into the enemy\nranks. Oh. Dozens of blazing spearmen\nand ironclad crusaders fell to the\nground simultaneously. Their prized\narmor offered almost no resistance\nagainst the armor-piercing attacks of\nthe divine archers. The Guan Ning\ncavalry instantly accelerated, their\nthunderous hooves booming like thunder,\ncutting straight into the Templar\nknights ranks, who were blocked and\nunable to move by the Emo Dao iron\nguards. Kill. The Guan Ning cavalry had\nno time to reload their three-eyed\nmusketss, nor did they attempt to use\ntheir lances against the heavily armored\nknights. They simply swung their\nthree-eyed musketss and smashed them\ndown. Thump! A loud explosion rang out.\nThe war horses of the Guan Ning cavalry\ncrashed heavily into the Templar Knights\nWarh horses, which had come to a\nstandstill. Head-on clash, the dynamic\nwaror rammed and won against the\nstationary warhorse. The blunt weapon,\ncomparable to a spiked club, struck the\nTemplar knight, piercing his armor and\nknocking him off his horse roar. Seeing\nthat there were more strong\nreinforcements, the iron guards with\ntheir Mod Dao swords erupted once again,\nslashing and hacking with their Mod Dao\nswords, blood spurting out. Pay Min, now\nwithout an opponent, has arrived at the\nmain battlefield and joined the battle.\nHis sword energy is unstoppable, and\nwith a single move, a white light\nflashes, knocking down several soldiers.\nLyn Sha also swung his sword, forcing\nthe Black Flames to retreat repeatedly.\n\"Black Flame, your death is near.\" The\nmeteorite pierced the sky and crashed\ndown, causing the Black Flame Legion to\nscream in agony. I don't know when it\nhappened, but the balance of power on\nthe battlefield has shifted. The Black\nFlame Legion's long bowman, Dwarven\nMountain Warriors, and Shadow Lurkers\nhave all been wiped out. The sword saint\nof Wuji has been killed and Ganu was\nstabbed to death by Chin Yu. The Templar\ncommander fled, leaving fewer than 30\nTemplar knights remaining. The Blazing\nSun Spearman and the Iron Wall Crusaders\nwere reduced to less than 40% after\nbeing struck by Lyn Xiao's meteorite.\nLyn Ziao's troops, however, suffered no\nlosses. Now the archers and the Guan\nNing cavalry are free to join forces to\nbesiege the remnants of the Black Flame\narmy. It's clear to everyone that Black\nFlame is now completely at a\ndisadvantage and defeat is imminent.\nLynn Shiao, you force me to this. Black\nFlame understood his predicament. He\nraised the sword in the stone, its blade\npointing towards the sky. Summon the\nsword spirit. The sword and the stone\nlit up and a beam of light shot into the\nsky. pointing towards the heavens. Black\nflame grinned maliciously. Lynn Shia,\nthe sword spirit is sealed within the\nsword in the stone. Once the sword\nspirit is unleashed, it will slaughter\nwithin a 100 miles. He won't return\nuntil he's killed enough. I'll make you\nand everyone in this newbie zone perish\nwith you. What? We're still watching the\nlive stream while munching on sunflower\nseeds. We're shocked. Black flame, you\nshameless bastard. You can't accept\ndefeat. You can't handle this, so you\nflip the table. That's shameless. Calm\ndown. You still have several hundred\ntroops and over a thousand Blood Lord\ntroops in Lyn Xiao's rear. And Ding Lay\nis about to be defeated. You still have\nhope. Don't give up. Instead, some\npeople in the live stream tried to\npersuade Black Flame. He he holy crap.\nWhat are you laughing at, you old\ngeyser? You're only laughing when you're\nnot in this newbie zone. Gene Wuang\nsaid, \"This does have the style of the\nHeavenly People organization. It's\nshameless, and I like it, ancestor. What\ndo you mean you like that? I'm about to\nexplode with anxiety. Everyone, think of\nsomething quick. What should we do?\" The\ncrowd chattered on and on like ants on a\nhot plate for quite some time. Suddenly,\nit dawned on me that the black flame\nsummoning sword spirit had an\nexcessively long wind up. Everyone\nlooked towards the live stream. On the\nbattlefield, time seemed to stand still.\nBlack flame held his sword, pointing it\nat the sky. The light of the sword in\nthe stone slowly dimmed, but the sword's\nspirit did not seem to have emerged yet.\nA silence seemed to fall over the room.\nLyn Sha narrowed his eyes and stared at\nhim coldly. Are your hands tired? Black\nflame, should we wait a little longer?\nBlack flame. A Lsha, what trick have you\nused now? Why can't I summon the sword\nspirit? I've already said it. It's&lt;unk&gt;\nbecause I am now the chosen one of this\nplane. Lynn Shiao said expressionlessly.\nThe blade spirit wouldn't dare come out\nand give me experience points. You? What\nnonsense are you spouting now? Boom. A\nbolt of lightning streaked across the\nsky. The sky, which was already covered\nwith dark clouds, turned as black as ink\nat some point, and a torrential downpour\nbegan. The strange movements in the sky\nstartled everyone. While black flame was\nfilled with doubt and uncertainty. The\ntime has come. Lynn Sha raised the\ncrimson sky sword and a streak of light\nflashed past. A sword comes from the\neast. The black flames collapsed\ninstantly. Chapter 123. The\ncounterattack in the valley. Something\nextraordinary. Black flame fell utterly\ndead. The audience in the live stream\nfell silent. But the battle is not over\nyet. Lyn Xiao's troops had surrounded\nthe remnants of Black Flame's army. The\ntwo sides were evenly matched in number,\nbut it was a one-sided crushing defeat.\nWithout the Lord's bonus and the hero's\nbonus, they managed to turn a winning\ngame into a losing one. The remaining\ntroops suffered a significant drop in\nattributes and were completely routed.\nThe outcome is decided. Lyn Sha slowly\nput away the Crimson Sky Sword. He no\nlonger needed to participate in the\nbattle. Pay Minodded to Lin Sha, took\nout a twisted little monster from his\npocket, and threw it into the remaining\ncrusaders. The little monster suddenly\ngrew and transformed into a giant demon\nwith many tentacles. Nest demon. The\nnest demon twisted and thrashed about,\nslapping with its tentacles, opening its\nenormous mouth to spew out acidic\nliquid, and frantically attacking the\nenemy forces. The level 30 epic unit,\nthe nest demon, was originally only on\npar with the black flames epic units.\nBut with this shift in power, how could\nthe remnants of the army, who had no\nwill to fight, possibly be a match for\nthe ferocious demons? The nest demons\nrampaged through the enemy ranks,\nreplenishing their energy with flesh and\nblood and rapidly eroding the remaining\nsparse resistance. Here, dozens of\nbloodthirsty lords along with their\ntroops had already entered Calabash\nValley. He was speechless, stunned. They\nhad just painstakingly entered the\nvalley when they saw Lynn Shiao kill\nBlack Flame in the live stream. Black\nFlame is dead. Should we still fight\nthis war? Someone hesitated. Fight. Why\naren't we fighting? Do you want to climb\nthe mountain again? Don't tell me\nthere's a beautiful heroine waiting for\nyou on the mountaintop. Dozens of fierce\nbarbarian spearmen could easily kill\neven dwarves. Do you want to go up the\nmountain to your death? It's too late to\nsurrender. Lyn Sha never seems to accept\nsurrender. This the blood lord\nhesitated. Lyn Sha went out of the\nlord's mansion to fight. And it will\ntake him some time to kill the black\nflame soldiers and get back. The only\nway now is to charge through, destroy\nthe mines occupied by Lin Shiao, take\ndown Lin Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s base, kidnap the\nfarmers and other remaining units, and\nnegotiate with Lin Shiao. The man said,\n\"If we're lucky, we might be able to\nchoke Lin Shiao and force him to\nsubmit.\" \"Good. The blood lords are a\ngroup of people who live on the edge of\na knife. Almost every one of them has\nblood on their hands and bears the\npunishment given by the god system. Some\nof them even have red names which they\ncan't escape rather than running away\nand hiding. It's better to just kill\nthem. The group immediately took action.\nThey entered the valley which was\nsurrounded by numerous mineral veins.\nThese mineral veins all indicate that\nLynn Shiao is the occupant, but they are\ncompletely deserted. This guy has taken\nover quite a few mines. And to guard\nagainst our sneak attacks, the farmers\nhave all evacuated. The group continued\nonward but saw no living beings. Be\ncareful. Keep an eye on things. Someone\nreminded me. Oh my. Is there a witch\nwaving at us ahead? A lord with the\nspecial ability of far-sightedness\nimmediately noticed the anomaly using\nhis talent. Wow. Dozens of bloodthirsty\nwitches. They're really pretty. Are they\ndissatisfied with Lin Shia and want to\njoin us? I once read a line in a novel.\nThe taste of a witch is really good.\nWe're going that way anyway. Why don't\nwe guys give it a try? Shut up. Do you\nstill have time for that? Let's fight\nour way through and sweep all the way to\nLord Lin Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s manner. The blood\nlords, numbering over a thousand, were\nutterly unafraid of the witch and\nmarched off in a mighty force. Sherry,\nit seems your beauty isn't working. A\ncyclops hiding behind the witch Sherry\nwhispered, \"They don't seem to be here\nto do anything to you. They seem to be\nhere to do anything to you. Shut up.\nVulgar and disgusting. Shirley was\nfurious. They're all going to die\nanyway. They dare to break into their\nmaster's backyard, burn, kill, and loot.\nAsk any of the native monsters here if\nthey'd agree to it. As soon as he\nfinished speaking, the marching army of\nthe blood lords was suddenly attacked.\nBehind the once deserted mine, in the\nwoods, and under the boulders, waves of\nall sorts of monsters emerged. cavemen,\norcs, cobalts, red goblins, centaurs,\nporcupines, and even horned demons and\nmonsters. All these demonic forces\nsuddenly appeared and besieged the blood\nlord's army. Ambush! Watch out! What's\ngoing on? Lyn Shia has so many different\ntypes of troops lying in ambush here.\nSome people resisted while shouting in\nsurprise, \"Shut up! We are not part of\nanyone's military. We are free natives.\"\nA porcupine man shot out sharp spikes\nwhile howling. Then why did you attack\nus? Our Lord is wise and mighty. He is\nour savior. Under his rule, we live in\npeace and prosperity with plenty of food\nand clothing, enjoying a wonderful and\ntranquil life. If you dare to ambush\nhim, you are going against millions of\nour kind-hearted indigenous people. You\ndare to ambush him, you're asking for\nour deaths. We will absolutely not allow\nanyone to harm our lord in the\nslightest. The bloodthirsty lords. Damn\nit. Did I hear that right? The monster\nsaid they were living a wonderful and\npeaceful life. They even say Lynn Shiao\nis the savior of them. These free\nnatives you experience packs and loot\ndrops actually recognize the person who\nwants to kill you as your savior. The\ncrowd couldn't believe it. They had\nnever seen a wild monster and its lord\ncoexist peacefully. A fierce demon\nsuddenly charged out, killing several\ntypes of soldiers. Even unruly monsters\nlike demons listened to him. He You\nheard me right. The witch Sherry,\naccompanied by the cyclops, also\ngathered around. Your master's abilities\nare beyond your imagination. You cannot\neven imagine the mercy of your master.\nNow prepare to die. The witch drew her\ndagger and closed in on one soldier\nafter another, her graceful figure\ncoiling around them like a python. her\nslender fingers caressing them like a\nlovers before slicing them to the throat\nwith a single blow. The cyclops lifted a\ngiant rock and hurled it into the enemy\nranks. Under the combined attack of the\nmonsters, the blood lord suffered heavy\ncasualties in a short time. Run, split\nup and run. The blood lord fled in\npanic. Someone ran deep into the forest\nand only a few screams were heard before\nsilence fell. Some people in a panic ran\nhap-hazardly to the gates of Linhao's\nterritory and before they could even\ncatch their breath, boom. The exploding\narrow tower fired arrows, instantly\nturning these lucky individuals into\ndust. The last bloodthirsty lord\ncollapsed to the ground, looking at the\nslowly approaching witch and asked in a\ntrembling voice, \"Why? Why do you all\nlisten to Lyn Sha? Even the demons\nlisten to Lyn Sha.\" Eh, I might as well\ntell you a secret I overheard by\naccident. Sherry approached with\ncat-like steps, the dagger spinning and\nleaping in her hand. A high-ranking\nabyssal demon with a broken horn once\nsaid. Sherry's red lips drew near the\nlord's ear, her voice magnetic and\nmelodious. He said that the succubus\nprincess wants to marry our lord. So,\nisn't it reasonable for a mid-level\ndemon like me and those irritable\nlow-level demons to obey their master?\nWhat this? Sherry's dagger flashed. The\nLord fell and the live stream ended. The\nviewers in the live stream were all\nbewildered. I think I just heard\nsomething incredible. Chapter 124.\nLucio's power. Dinglays choice. The\nfighting on the main battlefield has\nended. With the addition of the Grand\nMagus, the son of the plane, Lin Sha is\nconfident that even if Black Flames\nforces increase several times over, he\ncan annihilate the invading enemy.\nHowever, some of their own troops will\ninevitably suffer losses. Lucio's\njoining was a pleasant surprise. Lyn Sha\nstrolled slowly across the final\nbattlefield, surrounded by powerful\nsoldiers such as the Emo Dao Iron Guards\nwho were engaged in their final hunt.\nMeteorites still fall from the sky from\ntime to time. Lynn Shiao discovered that\nas long as he appeared on the\nbattlefield, meteorites would randomly\nfall, one after another, seemingly\nendless. Each one possesses the power of\na highle magic meteor spell several\ndozen levels high. Lyn Sha walked\nforward with his hands behind his back\nand his head held high. Behind him,\nmeteors and fire rained down\ncontinuously, and the entire battlefield\nhad turned into a sea of fire. He paid\nno attention to the fighting around him,\nstrolling leisurely, as awe inspiring\nand unapproachable as a true emperor.\nAfter I transferred Ba's fortune, and\nwith the Chi-Cha sword's 100%\nbattlefield fortune bonus, it's only\nnatural that Lucio would be willing to\nlend me his power temporarily. No matter\nwhat, the Chi-Cha sword was the sword of\nLu's ancestor when he founded the\ncountry, which should also be an\nimportant reason for attracting Lucio.\nView Lucio&lt;unk&gt;'s spirit attributes and\nmy current attributes.

Combat power\nrating 120 stars. I benefited greatly\nfrom the battle with Black Flame. My\nskills in mixed martial arts and full\nweapon control have both been upgraded.\nBattle is indeed the best teacher.\nAlthough Black Flame is level 30 and has\nan excellent armor set and a good sword,\nhis attributes are no match for mine\nafter Lucio possesses me. With the added\nbonus of my set and the terrifying 50 to\nall three attributes from the Crimson\nSky Sword, he has no chance at all. As\nexpected of the chosen one of the\nplanes, this is the first time I've seen\nsomeone with 500 more soul points. The\nsoul, the most mysterious attribute on\nthe battlefield of all races, is\ncategorized by some as fate and by\nothers as magic. I think luck also plays\na part. Lynn Sha let his thoughts wander\nas he walked in the opposite direction\nfrom his own lord's manner. \"Oh, right,\nPay Min, why don't you lead the troops\nto clean up the battlefield? We\ncan't&lt;unk&gt;t leave behind Black Flames\ngood equipment.\" \"Yes,\" Pay Min replied.\n\"I should go see my old rival.\" Lyn Sha\ngradually walked away. After Black\nFlame's death, the blood lord's ranks\nwere thrown into chaos. His numerous\nlive streaming rooms were no longer\nbeing attended to by his subordinates.\nThey even forgot they were still\nstreaming, focusing only on escaping and\nfighting. As one lord after another\nfell, only one perspective remained in\nthe live stream. The last perspective of\nthe area where Ding Lay was fighting.\nEveryone who was paying attention to\nthis great battle flocked in. On the\nbattlefield, chaos reigned. Ding Lay was\ncovered in blood, wounded in multiple\nplaces. His armor was torn, and his long\nsword was almost blunt. All his heroes\nhad perished, and the troops he led had\nbeen reduced to only a few dozen men.\nThe besieging blood lords still have\nseveral members remaining along with\nover 300 soldiers. He Ding Lelay parried\nan attack from a bloodthirsty lord and\nlaughed. Didn't you guys watch the live\nstream? Black Flame is dead. He died\nlike a clown. His promises to you have\nexpired. So what's the point of\ncontinuing the fight? It's all your\nfault, you shameless traitor. The most\nvicious attacker of Ding Lay was the fat\nguy who had always been at odds with\nDinglay. He and his shadow fiend hero\nworked together to kill Ding Lays hero\nand severely injured Dinglay. The fat\nman whose face was already covered in\nscars now looked even more ferocious\nlike a demon from hell and snarled. If\nit weren't for you, you traitor Chufinga\nand the others wouldn't have escaped. We\nrushed up to support Lord Black Flame a\nlong time ago. With more than a thousand\nof us, Lord Black Flame can kill Lin\nShia. Uggh. It's all your fault. The fat\nman frantically slashed at Ding Lay,\nseemingly possessed. Black Flame is\ndead, and we blood lords will definitely\nbe punished. I'm doomed, but I'll take\nyou down with me. Dingle's fighting\nskills were among the top tier in the\nbeginner zone. Even though he was\nseriously injured, he managed to block\nall of the fat man's attacks. He seized\nthe opportunity, raised his foot, and\nkicked the fat man away. But at that\nmoment, a shadow demon appeared behind\nhim and suddenly attacked from the\nshadows, piercing Ding Lays left leg.\nDing Lay collapsed to the ground in pain\nand in the process stabbed Shadow Demon\nwith his knife. The Shadow Fiend howled\nand used Shadow Escape to escape.\nSeveral soldiers came to Ding lays\nrescue but were brutally killed by the\nfat man who arrived at the scene. He\nrushed towards Ding lay step by step\nconstantly killing the soldiers who came\nto his rescue. Finally, all the troops\nwere wiped out and the bloodthirsty\nlords surrounded them. Only Ding Lay\nremained, slumped on the ground.\nDinglay, do you have any last words\nbefore you die? The fat man stared\nfiercely at Dinglay. Dinglay opened his\nmouth, a mouthful of blood spilling from\nthe corner of his lips. He laughed\nbitterly. I'm so damn unlucky. H scared\nnow. I'm so unlucky that I have to die\non the same day as you bunch of trash.\nYou bunch of goodfor-no trash who only\nknow how to ambush your own kind. You're\nnot even as good as a cesspool. At least\nyour can be used as fertilizer, but\nyour rotting flesh is something even\nyour own mother would despise. You bunch\nof trash should go back to the original\nchaotic abyss and see if anyone wants\nyou. You. You. The fat man was so angry\nhe was practically fuming. His finger\ntrembled as he pointed at Ding Lay,\nunable to utter a single complete\nsentence. The audience in the live\nstream was so shocked that they fell\nsilent. I never expected Ding Lay, who\nalways presents a virtuous and positive\nimage, to be so scathing in his insults.\nIs this is this his lord's talent? I\ndon't think so. It's more like he's\ngiven up and doesn't care anymore. Maybe\nhis lordly talent doesn't allow him to\nswear. In the discussion room, \"You,\nyou, you.\" The fat man finally uttered a\ncomplete sentence. \"You bastard. What's\nthe use of cursing me? You're going to\ndie anyway.\" Lynn shall never accept\nsurrender. Whether I kill you or not,\nyou're doomed. Who said I was going to\nsurrender? Dingle caught up in his rant.\nwent straight to the point. I'd rather\ndie die die die die die die die die die\ndie die outside jump off this cliff we\nwill absolutely not surrender to Lyn Sha\ngood you've got guts thanks Dinglay\nreplied casually then paused taken a\nback came from behind Dinglay turned\naround and the fat man also froze\nlooking at the distance walked over with\nhis hands behind his back his face\nexpressionless the battlefield fell\nsilent instantly everyone stopped and\nstared blankly at Lyn Sha Lynn In Shiao,\nyou dare come alone? Are you here to\ndie? The fat man roared and charged\nforward. All the bloodthirsty lords and\ntroops charged forward. Lyn Shia gave a\ncold snort and slowly drew his crimson\nsky sword. He unleashed another sword\nstrike from the east, transforming\nhimself and his sword into a streak of\nlight. This time, however, its power is\ngreater than ever before. Lucio&lt;unk&gt;'s\nskill, bravery, recorded in the Chinese\nclassic book of the later Han. Sun and\nhe also sent several thousand soldiers\nto fight. Emperor Guang Wu fled and\nbeheaded dozens of them. Lucio was able\nto single-handedly killed dozens of\nenemy soldiers amidst thousands of\ntroops, making his personal marshall\nprowess among the top of all emperors\nthroughout history. When Lucio fights\nagainst the enemy alone, his four\nattributes can all break through the\nlimits of ordinary people. The host who\npossesses him will enjoy an additional\n100% bonus to all attributes on the\nbasis of the original additional\nattributes. As the light faded, blood\nsplattered. The final image that\neveryone in the live stream saw was Lin\nSha standing proudly with his back to\nthe live stream, looking calm and\ncollected. On the battlefield, no one\nelse stood. Chapter 125. There's such a\nsuperpower. Can you become stronger just\nby showing off? Ding lay sat half on the\nground. Blood continuously oozing from\nthe corners of his mouth and the wounds\non his body. Normally, with such severe\ninjuries, he should not have been able\nto hold on. He smiled bitterly as he\nwatched Lynn Sha slowly approach him,\nthen sit down cross-legged and quietly\nwatch him like an old friend. They\nneither took action nor left. Are you\nhere to laugh at me? Why haven't you\nmade a move yet? Dinglay said calmly.\nLike those bloodthirsty lords, I also\nused a slaying talisman on you. You\ncould have easily killed me. Lynn\nshouted not respond to Ding Lay, but\ninstead asked, \"With such severe\ninjuries, you should have given up long\nago. Why are you still able to talk to\nme?\" Ding Lay turned his head away. This\nis none of your business. The live\nstream is now closed. If I leave you\nhere, I won't do anything. Lynsha said,\n\"You'll die just like everyone else once\nyour talent effect wears off.\" Dinglay\nsuddenly turned around and looked at\nLynsha. His eyes flickered as if he had\nsomething to say, but he held back. \"Are\nyou betting that I don't know about your\nlordly talent?\" Lyn Sha said calmly,\n\"You're betting I just said it off\nhand.\" \"You're&lt;unk&gt; about to die? Why do\nyou still care about these things?\" \"I\ndo care. Since I'm going to die anyway,\nI want to retain some dignity,\" Ding Lay\nsaid. They said, \"Lynn Sha never accepts\nsurrender. If you want to kill me, then\nkill me, but don't try to humiliate me.\nI'm a prominent figure at Jangdong\nnumber one high school, and I won't do\nanything like begging for mercy.\" Lyn\nSha scoffed. I've only killed a few\npeople, and you're already labeling me\nlike this. Everyone used to think you\nwere a virtuous and upright gentleman.\nDinglay opened his mouth, wanting to\nspeak, but then held back. He couldn't\nfigure out what Lin Sha was up to. So,\nhe kept quiet, hoping to retain some\ndignity. I see you're eager to die,\npartly because you don't want to be\nhumiliated, and partly because of the\nharsh words you just said in the live\nstream, right? Lynn Sha chuckled and\nsaid, \"Even if you die outside, you'd\nrather jump down than surrender. The\neffect of those harsh words has kept you\ngoing until now. But if you actually\nsurrender, the buff will disappear and\nyou will die immediately. Am I right?\nLynn Sha spoke slowly and deliberately,\nbut Dinglay&lt;unk&gt;s expression gradually\ndarkened. How do you know so much?\nDinglay asked. It's&lt;unk&gt; very simple.\nObserve, summarize, and analyze. Lyn Sha\nsat comfortably cross-legged opposite\nDing Lay, his Crimson Sky sword sheathed\nand tucked into his waistband. His\nwell-fitting dark armor combined with\nhis handsome appearance and calm\nexpression made Ding Lay feel envious. I\nhave reviewed all your public statements\nand performances. From the moment you\nentered the newbie zone, you started to\nshow off in a high-profile manner,\ncreated an alliance, and even tried to\nmediate between me and Xiao Daton.\nAlthough you took sides, you did want to\nbecome a respected person in the newbie\nzone. Then there's your encounter with\nTu Sha by Chien, and you even started a\nlive stream to fight the death knight.\nI'm wondering why you had to do it. Liv,\nyour actions against the blood lord are\nall aimed at accumulating reputation. In\naddition, someone gave me some detailed\ninformation about Black Flame, which\neven included your performance during\nyour school days. Who gave it to you?\nDinglay asked the question, looking\nslightly nervous. In short, she is a\nvery powerful person. Her influence far\nsurpasses that of you and me. Lyn Sha\ncontinued the topic directly, explaining\nin detail. You are considered one of the\ntop students in school, but your\nidentity and status are relatively\nconfidential. You are definitely not a\nhigh-profile person, plus your terrible\nskills. Based on all this information, I\ncan conclude that you only became\nhigh-profile after you awakened your\nlord talent. And your lord talent is\nrelated to being high-profile. In other\nwords, it's related to showing off.\nAfter speaking, Dinglay fell into a long\nsilence. After a long while, he raised\nhis head and Lyn Sha was still looking\nat him calmly. \"Hey, you guessed right.\nBut what does that have to do with you?\"\n\"It's very simple,\" Lyn Sha said. \"You\ndon't know how to show off. But I do,\nand I'm very good at it. So, I'll save\nyour life. You'll join me. Become my\nvassel lord. Then I'll teach you how to\nbe cool, and you'll become very\npowerful. This is also very beneficial\nto me. After all, I have gained a\npowerful henchman like you. Of course,\nfor the sake of the final result, our\nrelationship can be kept secret. Ding\nLay&lt;unk&gt;s eyes suddenly sharpened. Is\nthis really true? I, Lynn Sha, never\nbreak my word. Ding Lays pupils\ntrembled, and his breathing became\nslightly rapid. It was clear that he was\ntempted. Just then, Dinglay suddenly\ncoughed up a mouthful of blood. Heihei,\nDinglay said with a bitter laugh. Lin\nShia, you have already proven your\nstrength in the battle just now. If you\ncan make me stronger, I have no\nobjection to becoming your vassel lord.\nYou were right just now. My lord talent\nis a level soul of glory. This talent\nrequires me to constantly maintain a\nhigh profile in order to preserve and\nimprove my combat power. Dinglay showed\nLynn Shia his talent introduction\ninterface and at the same time his aura\nvisibly weakened. My current talent\neffect is about to disappear and my\ndeath is imminent. If you really have a\nway to make me stronger, then watch now.\nLynn Shiao didn't look up, but quietly\nlooked at Ding Lays talent introduction.\nAlthough the description given by the\ngod system was very literary, Lyn Sha\nstill summarized it in the simplest\nplain language. You can become stronger\njust by showing off. Successfully\nshowing off increases four main\nattributes: health, attack power,\ncritical hit rate, and defense. The more\nimpressive the display, the higher the\nbonus and the longer the duration. If\nyou successfully show off all the time,\nsome attributes can even get a permanent\nboost. Moreover, for certain types of\nshowing off, it seems that as long as\npeople are still spreading the story and\nbeing shocked by it, the effect of\nshowing off will last forever. No wonder\nDing Lelay had to boast about his\nA-level talent as soon as he entered the\nbattlefield of 10,000 races. It turns\nout that boasting really does make him\nstronger. No wonder he always kept a\nstraight face. He wanted to maintain his\nimage. No wonder he streamed himself\nwhen he challenged the death knight.\nSome people said he was so good that he\ncould cut the death knight in one blow,\nwhile others doubted him and he would\nget cut in return. Defeat Julie and\nothers single-handedly after\nestablishing his reputation in the\nnewbie zone. But after his reputation\ncollapsed, he couldn't even defeat a\ndozen bloodthirsty lords. Unfortunately,\nhe was still too inexperienced and\ncouldn't quite grasp the essence of it.\nThat's why he failed. When he finally\nfailed, he abandoned all pretenses and\nimage and started cursing. All the\nguesses were confirmed. Lyn Xiao's inner\nmonologue. Damn, isn't this the template\nfor a web novel protagonist? With this\ntalent, if given to a modern time\ntraveler, it probably wouldn't be much\nworse than his own eternal peace. Seeing\nDing Lays breath growing weaker and\nweaker, Lynn Shiao smiled slightly. Just\nfollow me. As long as you learn from me,\nyou'll have endless opportunities to\nshow off. Don't put it so harshly. It's\nthe spirit of glory. Isn't this just\nshowing off? Save your last breath and\ndon't die. I'll teach you right now.\ncrude and vulgar. Lyn Shaol leaned\ncloser to Ding Lay and slowly read aloud\na passage. Chapter 126. Only today do I\nrealize who I am. The great battle\nbetween Lin Sha and Black Flame has come\nto a complete end. The last live\nbroadcast also came to a stunning close\nas Lin Sha swept away all his enemies\nwith a single sword strike from the\neast. But the people, still eager for\nmore, didn't leave. They went to the\nchat channel and discussed what they had\njust seen and heard. Incredible.\nAbsolutely incredible. I actually\nstumbled upon an event where a novice\nlord supposedly had a success rate of\nonly 0.01%\nto defeat a lord from the official\ndistrict. And I even witnessed it all\nmyself. I saw it, too. Lyn Shiao is\nreally awesome. That's right. In terms\nof troop types, Lyn Xiao's troop types\ncompletely crush Black Flames epic troop\ntypes. In terms of strategy, Lin Shiao\ncountered every move from the front\nlines to the rear, blocking all of Black\nFlame's attacks. Compared to other\nheroes, Lyn Xiao's whiteclad hero could\neasily kill Wuji Sword Si. In terms of\nindividual strength, Lin Shiao is\ncapable of one-on-one combat, even\nsingle-handedly taking down one or 200\nlords and troops who were besieging Ding\nLay with a single sword strike. I\ndeclare Lin Sha to be the undisputed big\nboss. After the battle, even in the chat\nchannel, everyone started referring to\nLin Shia as big boss. Do you need to\nannounce this? Someone mocked. Lynn Shia\nis more than just a big shot. I think\nhe's a truly unparalleled genius. He\nonly has an F-rank talent, yet he was\nable to defeat the level 63 Black Flame\nand so many golden legendary and epic\nunits in the official zone. Someone\nsighed. I really don't know how boss Lyn\nShao did it. Why is he so strong? Why\nare his heroes and troops so strong? And\neven that useless old devil Jean can't\nrecognize boss Lin Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s troops.\nGene Wuang, I haven't left yet. Can't\nyou all show some respect to me, the\nChief Lord? Why aren't you going home\nyet? Gene Wuang, I am waiting for Lin\nSha to tell me the secret of the\nCullinan Iron Cavalry. The crowd\nsaid,\"Old man, you really are a thief\nwho never leaves empty-handed, and\nyou're shameless enough to ask Lyn Shiao\nfor military secrets after he killed\nyour descendants.\" Gene Wuang, shut up.\nI'm doing this for the greater good of\nLang Shia. Everyone, yes, yes, yes. Gene\nWuang kept making wrong predictions, and\nsince his clones weren't very effective,\npeople in the live stream who knew him\nactually dared to joke about him. Lyn\nXiao&lt;unk&gt;s Cullinan cavalry is indeed\npowerful. This self-created unit is too\nstrong, a genius's exclusive, someone\nsaid in front of the great Lin Sha, all\nso-called geniuses pale in comparison.\nWhat about Pan Shan Yu, the king of\nJulie, who ranked second, fourth, and\nfifth in the second tier universities?\nHe's considered a genius in the Jong\nDong newbie zone, right? He was\ninstantly defeated by Ding Lay. So, Ding\nLay is considered a genius, right? I saw\nsome people comparing him to Lyn Sha,\neven saying that Ding Lay is more\npowerful than Lyn Sha, but Ding Lay\ncan't defeat those dozen or so\nbloodthirsty lords and their troops.\nBoss Lyn Sha could kill them with a\nsingle sword strike. That's right. Who's\nas good as Lyn Sha? Lyn Shia is a\npeerless genius. Human nature is indeed\ncomplex. Lynn Shiao was looked down upon\nand despised before the war, but now he\nis praised by many people. These people\nseem to have forgotten that they were\nthe ones who were most vocal when they\nwere praising Ding Lelay and criticizing\nLyn Shao. Two Shawn Bachen who were\nreceiving treatment under the care of\nthe flower fairy and the healing effects\nof the territory couldn't help but twist\ntheir lips into a grotesque smile when\nthey saw the crazy flattery in the chat\nchannel. If Lin Shiao hadn't already\nprivately messaged them, telling them\nnot to speak carelessly in the chat\nchannel and that he would explain later\nat the meeting, the two of them would\nhave already joined the chat channel to\nmock everyone's opportunistic behavior\nwhile enjoying their praise. By the way,\nwhere's Dinglay? When talking about\ngeniuses, some people think of Ding Lay,\na genius from the same district. Lynn\nShia used his final sword strike to kill\nthe last person broadcasting live and\nthen shut down the live stream. But no\ndeath warning for Ding Lay has ever\nappeared. \"Ding Llay isn't dead yet,\"\nsomeone exclaimed. \"That despicable man.\nWe trusted him so much before. I thought\nhe was the most just and prestigious\nlord in our newbie zone. Someone who\nstood up for all newbies and was\ndedicated to eliminating evil and\nwickedness. I never expected to be\nfooled by him. He's actually on the\nblood lord's side. He's probably killed\nquite a few newbie lords. Yes, he was\nactually putting on an act with the\nblood lords. No wonder he knew so many\nhidden blood lords. Well, you can't say\nthat. I guess Ding Lay had his own\nreasons. Didn't he break with Black\nFlame in the end? He fought against\nnearly a thousand blood lords and troops\nall by himself. I also think Ding Lay\nwas forced onto this pirate ship. If\nDinglay doesn't turn against us, things\nmight get a bit complicated for boss Lin\nSha. What's the trouble? Is it possible\nthat boss Lynn Sha can't defeat these\nlittle Kurami bloodthirsty lords? That's\ntrue, but Dinglay has already used his\nown death. Huh? Dinglay isn't dead yet.\nI remember he said he wanted to\nsurrender. His last words were that even\nif he died, even if he died outside,\neven if he jumped off this building, he\nwould never surrender to boss Lyn Sha.\nHe was quite ambitious. The crowd was\nsomewhat puzzled. The current situation\nis that there is no live broadcast, no\nexplanation from the parties involved\nand no system notification. So the\npublic has not yet gotten any updates on\nthe outcome of this feud between the\ntwo. So what exactly is the connection\nbetween Ding Lelay and boss Lyn Shia?\nWell, just then a faint sigh rang out.\nThe ID is actually Dinglay. The chat\nchannel was immediately filled with\nsurprise. Before anyone could ask a\nquestion, Ding Lay said quietly, \"My\nlords, Ding Llay has been enlightened by\nBrother Lin Shiao and has become sworn\nbrothers with him.\" \"The past mistakes\nare in the past. I have never killed a\ngood person apart from Brother Lin\nShiao. I, Ding Lay, have never harmed\nany good person. From now on, I am\nreborn. I am not merely Lin Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s\nsword and blade. I am still Ding Lay,\nfighting for justice. I will forever be\non the path of eradicating evil.\nEveryone was stunned for a moment. Then\nsomeone said, \"Lynn Shia actually let\nDinglay go.\" Looks like Lynn Shia and\nDing Lay have become sworn brothers.\nWow, I'm so envious of Ding Lay. What\nDinglay said makes some sense. He really\nhasn't killed any good people. If Boss\nLynn shall forgive him, then let's\nforgive him, too. No, Dinglay said\nslowly. I don't need your forgiveness.\nThe chat channel suddenly went silent.\nDing Lay slowly recited. Throughout my\nlife, I have cultivated good deeds and\nhave never loved killing or arson.\nSuddenly, the golden rope is broken and\nthe jade lock is shattered. Ah, the tide\nof the Chintang River is coming and only\ntoday do I realize who I am. Ladies and\ngentlemen, I have found myself. From now\non, I will become stronger. Everyone,\nplease look forward to my performance.\nNo one spoke for a long time. Ding Lays\ncasually uttered words, neatly arranged\nand easy to recite, simply described his\nactions, and expressed his\ntransformation. The way he condensed\nnumerous events into short sentences,\neven sounded somewhat philosophical.\nThis strange way of expressing himself\nevoked a strange sense of familiarity in\neveryone along with a vague feeling of\nexcitement and joy. It's like regaining\nlost wealth. The tide comes in on the\nChantang River, and only today do I\nrealize who I am. The crowd pondered the\nwords, savoring them as they came to\nmind, while a multitude of thoughts\nraced through their minds. Dingle is\ntruly a dragon among men. To be able to\ncreate such a sentence, Dinglay is not\nbad either. Although he can't compare to\nLin Sha, his words are so philosophical.\nHe deserves to be called a genius who\ncan take on three people at once.\nPerhaps Dinglay is also a genius of his\ngeneration. His magnanimity when he said\nthat he did not need to be forgiven\nproves his inner strength. Over here,\nDinglay felt his injuries healing\nsteadily and his physical condition\nimproving rapidly. He recovered quickly.\nSoon, his body reached its peak, the\nlevel it had when he single-handedly\nfought three geniuses. Soon, my body had\nreached an unprecedented level of\nstrength, and I felt full of power. The\ncurrent Mi can easily defeat the Mi at\nmy peak. Ding Lay raised his head, his\neyes blazing with fury, and looked at\nLin Sha with a stern expression. Just by\nreciting the so-called poems you gave\nme, you can exert such power. Chapter\n127. Subduing Ding Lay and colluding\nwith the Demon Clan. Just by reciting\nthe so-called poems you gave me, you can\nexert such power. As Dinglay spoke, he\nlooked at Lyn Sha in front of him with a\ncold expression. As his condition\nimproved, he gradually regained his\nsuperior demeanor. Lyn Sha was over 1.8\nm tall, but Ding Lay, who was standing\nup, was even taller than him. He looked\ndown at Lyn Sha, exuding a sense of\noppression. Lynn Shao remained unmoved,\nmerely tilting his head slightly to look\nat Ding Lay and said calmly, \"Of course,\nthis kind of poetry has a fatal\nattraction for the people of Lshia, and\nyou've seen the result. Moreover, what\nI'm telling you isn't even a poem. It's\nat most a verse, just from a popular\nnovel, not worth a second glance. Before\ntrue poetry, the power of your glorious\nspirit will exceed your wildest\nimagination. Do you know that my current\nstrength has become so great that even I\nam shocked? Dinglay took a step forward\nindifferently, heading towards Lin\nShiao. I think I can now put up a fight\nagainst Black Flame. Lyn Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s lips\ncurled into a slight smile. So So\nDinglay stared intently at Lin Sha for a\nfew seconds. Then he prostrated himself,\nknelt on one knee, and lowered his head\ntoward Lin Shao. I, Ding Lay, am willing\nto become Lin Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s vassel Lord.\nunconditionally and sign a vassal lord\ncontract. All conditions are to be\ndecided by Lynn Sha. Very good. Lyn Sha\nnodded. You will learn a saying. Those\nwho understand the times are the heroes.\nLyn Sha immediately found a three-year\nvassal lord contract in the main god\nsystem space and made the strictest\nrestrictions in the contract. All acts\nof betrayal by vassal lords are subject\nto the highest level of punishment.\nFurthermore, it is stipulated that upon\nthe expiration of the contract, the lord\nhas the right to choose to renew it and\nthe vassel lord cannot refuse. Dinglay\nis not like tu shan by chien heay or\nchining. Although I also saved\nDinglay&lt;unk&gt;s life, his superpowers\ndictate that he will only keep showing\noff and keep on the path of showing off\neven more. If Ding Lay can ever surpass\nhimself, that will be the greatest\nsuccess in his life. By then, will Ding\nLace still listen to me? Or will he\nsimply use me as a stepping stone on his\npath to showing off? Lynn Shia never\ntests human nature. He only goes along\nwith it. This most stringent vassal lord\ncontract was then presented to Ding Lay,\nwho was kneeling on one knee. Dingle\nlooked at it carefully without any\nemotional fluctuation and signed the\ncontract directly. Lyn Shao breathed a\nslight sigh of relief. If Ding Lay\ndoesn't even look at it, then he must\nhave ulterior motives and he absolutely\ncannot be kept. Ding Lay carefully read\nthe contract, which shows that he took\nthe matter seriously. On the surface, he\nseemed to be sincere. I like using sharp\nknives, even though there's a risk of\ncutting my hand. Lin Shiao said calmly.\nOne day, you will realize how right your\nchoice was. Let's go. Come with me to my\nterritory. It's necessary to discuss\nwhat to do next with Lin Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s\nteam. After signing the vassal lord\ncontract, the price of Ding Lays\nbetrayal would be extremely high. Lyn\nSha could confidently bring him into the\nterritory and allow him to reconcile\nwith his members. Yes. Seeing Ding Lays\nsincere expression, Lyn Sha silently\nnodded in his heart. Did he really go to\nsuch lengths to win over Ding Lay just\nto have another powerful underling? No.\nThere's also his powerful lordly talent.\nSoul of glory becomes stronger by\nshowing off. Because of his eternal\npeace and prosperity, continuing the\nlost learning of the sages, he can learn\nany skill, including lord talents. In\nthis world of Langia, where the original\nChinese history has been lost, the\nancient Chinese civilization holds a\nfatal attraction for the Lia people. Of\nclassical Chinese poetry, pros or even\npretentious internet slang slip out. Lyn\nShao is confident he can pull off this X\nact and become even more powerful by\nbinding Ding Lay with the strictest\nvassel Lord contract. Lyn Shia will help\nhim become stronger. But even if he were\nto become stronger than himself, the\npower of the contract granted by the god\nwould still leave Ding Lay completely\npowerless against Lin Sha. Once I learn\nDing Lays Soul of Glory, Ding Lay will\nnever be able to catch up with me again.\nI will be far ahead. far ahead. However,\nI still haven't figured out the trigger\nconditions for this, inheriting the lost\nskills of the sages. I've been in the\nbattlefield of 10,000 races for so long,\nand I only learned a set of panlong\nstaff from Emperor Taizu of Song when I\nleveled up to 10, and I learned a sword\ncoming from the east when I went to\nfight Brands with Pay Min. However, I\ncan take my time, and there's no rush\nsince Dinglay is already my vassel lord.\nLyn Sha then led Ding lays slowly back\nthe way they came. Waste You\nyellow-kinned monkeys are utterly\nuseless. A bunch of pigs. Inside the\nmagnificent gothic mansion, the man in\nthe floral shirt violently swept the\ntabletop to the floor with a loud bang,\nthen picked up a vase from the coffee\ntable and smashed it on the floor. Not\nsatisfied with that, he searched the\nroom for anything else he could break\nand vented his anger. Wongu knelt on the\nground, his head buried deep in his legs\nlike an ostrich, not daring to move.\nThat's a legendary gold unit. That's an\nepic unit. A whole thousand people. Only\nRam managed to escape using a\nlife-saving item. The man in the floral\nshirt pointed a trembling finger at Wong\nSu. As soon as Rahm returned, he ran\nback to Jerusalem. He's going to\ncomplain about me to the Grandmaster of\nthe Knights Templar. They're saying that\nwe Lia set a trap to frame the noble\nknights Templar. 100 Templar knights\nhave fallen and now the most powerful\nregion in the entire blue star realm,\nWestern Europe, is enraged. The Middle\nEast is also enraged. Japan is also\ntaking advantage of this situation to\ntry and extort benefits from us. The man\nin the floral shirt was so angry his\neyes almost popped out. His usual calm\nand collected demeanor was completely\ngone. Wong Su, Wong Su, can you bear the\nconsequences? Didn't you say Black Flame\nwas your most capable subordinate? How\ncome he can't even handle a newbie lord\nwho's not even level 30? And he\nsquandered so much of my precious\nresources, my sword in the stone, my\nlegendary golden unit, my epic unit.\nWhat is your crime? Oh. The man in the\nfloral shirt roared to the sky filled\nwith grief and indignation. My lord,\nplease forgive me. My lord, please\nforgive me. Wong Su with his hooked nose\ncould only bury his head on the ground\nand keep begging for mercy. That Lyn\nSha, there's something fishy about him.\nThen tell me, what's so strange about\nLin Sha? Pu Dawei s voice carried a hint\nof coldness. That Lin Sha, he only has\nfranklord talent. How could he possibly\ncompletely overwhelm Black Flame in\nterms of troop type, hero, and personal\nstrength? Wong Su, sweating profusely,\nvoiced his judgment. His units, apart\nfrom the phantom archers and faceless\nones, are all unfamiliar to us. Yet,\nthey are exceptionally powerful. So,\nwhat? I don't need you to emphasize how\namazing he is. Pu Dawei rubbed a flame\nin his hand, his expression growing\nincreasingly impatient. It's the demons.\nLynn Shiao is colluding with the demons.\nWong Su blurted it out. Chapter 128. The\npast of the demon clan. The past of the\nsuccubus princess. Demons. The man in\nthe floral shirt paused, his expression\nturning serious. How do you know? My\nlord, my lord, it is like this. Wongu\nquickly raised his head, knelt, and took\na few steps forward and said\ningratiatingly, \"My lord didn't watch\nthe whole live broadcast, but I watched\nit through gritted teeth the whole\ntime.\" Combined with the rumors\nsurrounding Lin Shiao, I can basically\nconclude that Lynn Shiao has a\nsignificant collusion with the demon\nclan. Speak. Stop talking nonsense. Yes.\nYes. Heard the accusations of the abyss\ndemon in a live broadcast room that he\naccidentally opened. They said Lin Shia\nhad tainted their princess's reputation.\nA demon princess? Pu Dawei, the man in\nthe floral shirt, frowned slightly and\nglanced at the stunningly beautiful\nangel standing quietly behind him. Upon\nhearing this, the goldenhaired angel\nalso raised her head. Her face, which\nhad remained calm and still for\nmillennia, turned towards Wong Su. Yes,\nthe demon princess. It should be that\ninfamous succubus princess, Andrea. What\na joke. What innocence does Andrea have?\nPu Dawei muttered to himself. grown-ups,\nit's nothing. Please continue. Yes, many\npeople have heard the accusations of the\nabyss demon. That's one point. Secondly,\nthe team that Black Flame sent to raid\nLin Xiao's rear was actually besieged by\nthe native monsters in the valley, which\nis a very rare occurrence in the past.\nWong Su said, \"In other realms outside\nof Blue Star, there are elven players\nwho can subdue elven monsters at a very\nlow cost. dwarf players who can coexist\npeacefully with dwarf monsters and\nhighle demons who are born with the\nability to dominate low-level demons. No\nhuman player has ever been able to\neasily subdue so many different kinds of\nwild monsters. Moreover, among these\nwild monsters are demonic monsters such\nas the fierce demon and the bone demon.\nThe fierce demon is known for its\nviolent and fearless nature, and there\nis almost no record of it being subdued.\nIsn't that suspicious? Pu Dawei nodded,\nsignaling Wong Su to continue. Third,\none of the lords who was besieged heard\na witch speak to him personally before\nhe died. The reason the demons obeyed\nLin Shiao is because the succubus\nprincess wanted to marry him. What? Pu\nDawi&lt;unk&gt;s eyes narrowed instantly, a\ndangerous glint flashing within them.\nWhat merits does that brat possess to\nwin the favor of the succubus princess?\nHe's from a race I've never even\ntouched. What right does he have to lay\na finger on her? Upon seeing the\nleader's outburst, Wong Su immediately\nfell silent in fear. After a moment, the\nstrong winds that had been swirling\naround them gradually subsided, and Wong\nSu continued. If these three points are\nnot enough, there is actually a fourth\npoint. After Black Flame was killed, the\nlive broadcast perspective of the main\nbattlefield was maintained for a period\nof time. The white-clad hero pulled a\nnest demon from his robes and tossed it\ndirectly into the iron wall crusader's\nformation, shattering their last line of\ndefense. My lord, the nest demon is an\nepic quality demon. It's incredible that\nLyn Xiao's hero can raise a nest demon.\nIt is indeed very suspicious. It's\nhighly suspicious, sir. How could Lin\nShiao, a useless person with F-level\ntalent, manage to win first place in so\nmany level ups? How could he acquire one\npowerful unknown troop type after\nanother? Even Gene Wuang, one of the\nchief lords of Lang Shia, didn't\nrecognize those troop types. The only\nones we recognized were those 20 epic\nquality demon spies, the faceless ones.\nHis sword was evenly matched with the\nsword in the stone, so it must be a\nweapon of epic quality or higher. During\nhis battle, meteors kept falling from\nthe sky. That's highle fire magic. How\ncould someone possibly unleash that in a\nbeginner's area? Unless Unless what?\nPawi also noticed something a miss.\nUnless it's an abyss demon. Abyss demons\ncan unleash a weakened version of meteor\nshower, which is essentially a group\nmeteor spell. If a demon from the abyss\nwas secretly helping, then everything\nbecomes clear. Wongu resolutely blocked\nthe railway. Pu Dawei fell silent. He\nsquinted slightly and paced back and\nforth unconsciously. Since that glorious\nbattle thousands of years ago, the demon\nrace, which had helped the ancient evil,\nhas suffered a great loss of strength.\nOriginally able to rival the gods,\ngradually declined and was defeated in\nthe battle for the second heaven and was\nforced to hide in the abyss, the lair of\nthe sixth heaven. Their elite troops\nscattered and fled, forced to constantly\nwander and hide across various realms.\nMany more demons, leaderless, gradually\nbecame wild monsters on the battlefield\nof all races. But after Andrea's sudden\nemergence, the demon race has become\nrampant again in recent years. This\ncruel and cunning succubus, regardless\nof her chaotic love life, is not only\nunparalleled in martial arts, but also\npossesses countless highle spells,\nmaking her arguably the number one among\nthe younger generation in the sixth\nheaven. She also had a wide range of\ninterests, enjoying research and\nexperimentation in her spare time and\nhad cultivated many new demonic unit\ntypes. It is said that the faceless ones\nwere created by Andrea. With this\nalternative demonic soldier that has no\ndemonic characteristics at all and can\ntransform into various humanoid forms.\nAndrea successfully planted spies in all\nrealms. At this point, Pu Dawei paused,\nstunned. You just said that Lynn Shiao\nhas faceless warriors. Yes, sir.\nInteresting. Pu Dawi rubbed his chin\nusing a recruitment token to directly\nrecruit an epic demon unit. This makes\nhim even more suspicious. That's right,\nsir. That's why I said Lynn Shiao is\ncolluding with the demons. That way, his\nstrength can be explained. Seeing that\nthe leader had already agreed with his\nstatement, Wong Su quickly pressed his\nadvantage. My lord, the highle demons\nare the common enemy of the blue star\nhuman race covenant and even the ninth\nheaven covenant. Since Lynn Shiao is\ncolluding with the demons, we can report\nhim to the authorities and make him a\npublic enemy hated by everyone. When the\ntime comes, someone will naturally deal\nwith Lin Sha. Report my ass. Pu Dawei\nsuddenly kicked Wong Su, sending him\ntumbling to the ground. Have you\nforgotten what kind of organization we\ncelestials are? You, a bloodthirsty lord\norganization, reported to that in\nthe dragon summer domain that you were\nbullied by the demons. She's probably\nsecretly laughing. You may be able to\nafford to lose face, but I can't. Pu\nDawei said angrily, then took a few\nsteps and then remembered something.\nHowever, ruining Lin Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s\nreputation is not a bad idea. We just\nneed to find some people to spread the\nnews that Lyn Shiao is colluding with\nthe demons. Once the lords all know that\nLin Shiao is colluding with the demons,\nhe will indeed be suspected and\nisolated. At that time, we will have\nplenty of opportunities to deal with\nhim. Your excellency is wise. Huh? Stop\nflattering me. Huawei said, \"Lin Sha\nwill soon be promoted to a full\ndistrict.\" At that time, the task of\nlocating him and hunting him down is now\nyours. Conquests in the official zones\ndon't have as many restrictions as those\nin the broken zones. You, a topranked\nLord ranked 100, can't possibly be\nunable to handle Lin Sha this time. I'm\nranked at the top. Wong Su was about to\nspeak again, but seeing Pu Dawi&lt;unk&gt;s\nfierce expression, he changed the words\nhe was about to blurt out and said, \"I\nguarantee I'll blast Lin Sha to\nsmitherines.\" Chapter 129. Not a demon,\nbut an ancient evil spirit. Is Lin Sha\ncolluding with the demon clan? Inside a\npalace with an understated Chinese\narchitectural style, a stunningly\nbeautiful, mature, and aloof woman posed\na question in a cool voice. That's\nright, Lord Domain Lord. Besides what I\njust mentioned about Lyn Xiao's\nrelationship being exposed in his live\nstream, Lyn Shao possessing the faceless\ndemon and the hero's nest demon pet, Lyn\nXiao's own strength is so formidable\nthat it is the biggest point of\nsuspicion. Lyn Sha has several military\nbranches that no one recognizes. An\nofficial said, \"It's normal for a genius\nto create one or two types of troops,\nbut Lynn Shiao created the Gust Archers,\nthe Cullinan Iron Cavalry, the most\npowerful swordsmen who can defeat the\nTemplar knights, and savage soldiers who\ncan climb cliffs. Each of them is\nincredibly powerful. That's not normal.\"\nFurthermore, we estimate that the\nstrength of these units should be around\nepic quality. Another official added,\n\"The ability to create several epic\nquality units inevitably brings to mind\nAndrea of the demon race. Shill, quiet.\nWe'd better not say her name, lest\npeople from other domains\nmisunderstand.\" The officials present\nnodded in agreement. \"Yes, we must not\nleave any more leverage for other\nregions. Dragon Sa and the demon clan\nmust be irreconcilable enemies.\" Humph.\nOnly Chu Yusi gave a cold snort. timid\nand cowardly, lacking any spirit. She\ncan't even mention the demon princess's\nname. Afraid of being misunderstood.\nAfraid of being misunderstood by whom?\nBy the Americas, by Western Europe, by\nJapan? Haven't&lt;unk&gt; already imposed\nenough filth on us, Chu. You see, an\nofficial retorted. You may be able to\nshow off your power for a moment, but do\nyou know how much pressure the domain\nlord is under? If this causes diplomatic\nunpleasantness between the two countries\nand the national destiny competition\nbegins, Liao might be demoted and have\nits destiny reduced again. Are you going\nto take responsibility for that? If I'm\nkicked off the National Fortune Arena\nfor such a trivial matter, I Shui will\npersonally take to the stage. And if I\nlose, I'll commit suicide to atone for\nmy sins. You wish. Whether you step into\nthe ring or not is not up to you. All\nright, everyone, quiet down. A cold\nfemale voice rang out. The Lord of Lang\nSha domain had spoken. Chu Yusi and the\nnoisy officials all quieted down. I\nalready know about what you just\nmentioned about Lin Sha colluding with\nthe demons. There are many doubts about\nthis matter, and there is no substantial\nevidence, so it is not appropriate to\ndraw any conclusions rashly. Rumors\nabout Lynn Shiao and the demon race have\nalready begun to circulate throughout\nthe entire Lnon region. A cold\nindifferent voice waved its hand\ndismissively saying a saying that came\nfrom who knows where goes. Rumors stop\nwith the wise. These people who were\nswayed by rumors were saying Lynn Sha\nwas doomed. Does anyone still mention it\nnow? Lord territory Lord. All right,\nthat's all for today. Meeting adjourned.\nOne by one, the remotely connected 3D\nlight screens disappeared until only Chu\nYui remained. \"Chui, if it weren't for\nLin Shiao, your three most capable and\ntrusted lieutenants would likely have\nperished in the newbie zone,\" a cold\nvoice said. \"Haven't&lt;unk&gt; you learned\nyour lesson after suffering a loss\nonce.\" Chu Yusi scratched his head\nawkwardly. \"We didn't expect the\nCelestials to deploy their most elite\ntroops for a big surprise attack. In\nprevious years, when the breaking zones\ndescended, didn't they just use some\nsuperior troops to crush them? However,\nI did secretly give Fong Guu a heads up.\nIn critical moments, saving lives is the\nmost important thing, and they did just\nthat. Huh? The cold voice remained\nnon-committal. As it continued, \"Why\ndidn't you offer your opinion on the\nmatter between Lin Shia and the Demon\nClan earlier?\" Chu Yusi was even more\nembarrassed. To be honest, I also think\nthere's something wrong with that kid,\nLyn Sha. He's so handsome. Maybe Andrea\nreally has her eye on him. Andrea's\nprivate life is so rich that it can't be\ncontained in a single book. Lyn Sha even\nhad a little scandal with her. Um, aim.\nWhat I mean is, Lyn Sha is a very\npromising newcomer. It would be one\nthing if there were one or two\nsuspicious things related to the demon\nrace, but now there are so many.\nConsidering everything, Lyn Sha is\nindeed somewhat suspicious. So, you also\nagree with investigating Lyn Sha or\nnipping him in the bud? No, no, no,\nLord. I suspect Lyn Sha might have\nconnections with the demon clan, Chu\nYusi said. But so, what if we have a\nconnection? Lia is poor and weak and\nsuffers from oppression. As long as Lia\ncan become strong, even if it colludes\nwith the demons, I Chu Yusi can turn a\nblind eye. Chu Yusi, you don't seem to\ncare about the Blue Star Convention's\ndescription of the demons as vicious and\nruthless. The cold voice said, \"You've\ngot some nerve, Lord of the Domain.\nPlease forgive my rudeness.\" Chu Yusi\nspoke eloquently, showing no fear\nwhatsoever. The Blue Star Convention\nonly restricts developing countries like\nus. when has it ever restricted\ndeveloped countries? This kind of law is\nonly for the weak. The strong don't care\nat all. Furthermore, the fact that the\nhigher demons are extremely vicious and\nthat everyone on blue star has the right\nto kill them is a big deal. Every year,\nhow many deaths and injuries are caused\nby the higher demons attacking the\nwestern European region and the American\nregion? Yet, we have almost never heard\nof the higher demons attacking my\ndragon.\nAlthough I don't know the reason, I\nbelieve in the saying, \"The enemy of my\nenemy is my friend.\" Chu Yusi's eyes\nshone brightly. \"Even if Lynn shout\ndoesn't have concrete evidence right\nnow, I can accept it even if he really\nhas something going on with the demons.\"\n\"Chui, you're playing with fire.\" A cold\nvoice sideighed. \"Go downstairs. I want\nto be alone for a while.\" Chu Yusi shut\ndown 3D communication and the meeting\ncame to a complete end. Lord Long Lia\nstood up, stared into the distance, and\nwas in a daysaze. My lady, the first\nprophet has come to visit. A servant\nannounced in a low voice from outside\nthe door. Khalil Jabbron has arrived.\nPlease invite him in. A moment later, a\ntall elderly man with a high nose, blue\neyes, and a full head of white hair\nwalked in with a smile. Lord Dugu, it\nseems you have something on your mind.\nThe old man had many wrinkles on his\nface, but his eyes were still\nexceptionally bright and full of\ncunning. Hei, this is all thanks to you,\nprophet. Lord Long Lia said with a\nsmile. You said that Lin Sha would be\nthe most powerful ranger lord in Lang\nShia and could even reverse Lia&lt;unk&gt;s\ndecline. He hasn't even entered the\nnewbie zone yet, and rumors are already\ncirculating that he's colluding with the\ndemons. This whole thing has been\ndriving me crazy. Khalil Jibron laughed\nheartily. May I ask, Lord Dugu, do you\nstill remember the secret story I told\nyou before? Yes. The demon race has\nfallen into such a state because they\nhelped the ancient evil demons, and the\nancient evil demons seem to have nothing\nto do with our long. Khalil Jibron\nnodded, his smile fading. Whether Lin\nShiao is connected with the demon race\nis still unknown, but I can confirm that\nLin Sha has some connection with the\nancient demons. What? A hint of surprise\nappeared in the otherwise cold voice.\nAncient demons. These are the common\nenemies of the nine heavens and even all\nrealms more infamous than the demon\nrace. Mr. Jabbrron, please don't jump to\nconclusions. Khalil Jabbron nodded and\nsaid, \"Does the domain lord not know me\nwell enough? I have already recognized\nthat the sword Lynn Sha held during his\nbattle with black flame is one of the\ndivine swords created by the ancient\ndemons Crimson Sky.\nThe cold voice was filled with shock.\nThat's right. It shares the same origin\nas the Tha sword inherited by the domain\nlord s family. The crimson sky sword s\nstatus is no lower than that of the Tha\nsword. domain lord. In my opinion, Lyn\nShao is truly connected to the ancient\ndemons. After a moment of silence, the\nstunningly beautiful woman, lord of\ndragon summer domain, slowly spoke,\n\"Does Mr. Jabbrron mean that my Duga\nfamily is also related to ancient evil\nspirits?\" Chapter 130. Mythical cards\nangels, your subordinate dares not. The\nThai sword is a family heirloom sword\nobtained by the ancestor of the domain\nlord from slaying an ancient demon. The\ndomain lord is the pillar of Lshia. How\ncould he collude with an ancient demon?\nKhalil Jibron lowered his head slightly,\nhis gaze calm as he looked at the\nstunningly beautiful woman before him. I\nam merely informing Lord Domain about\nLin Xiao's suspicious aspects. After a\nlong silence, the woman withdrew her\ndoineering aura, stared intently at the\nprophet before her, and said, \"Word by\nword, if Lyn Shiao is truly connected to\nancient demons, what suggestions do you\nhave?\" Before Jabbrron could answer, the\nwoman continued, \"Originally, he was\nonly associated with the demon race, so\nI could still protect him. Now, it's\nrelated to an ancient demon, an enemy of\nall realms. No one can protect him. It\nseems the only way is to act swiftly and\neliminate him beforehand to avoid\ngetting burned. The stunningly beautiful\nwoman spoke, her eyes never leaving the\nold man in front of her. Khalil\nJabbrron's expression remained calm as\nhe slowly spoke. I don't think so. I\nhave great confidence in my prophecy. It\nsays that Lin Sha will be the top\nwandering night lord in the future of\nLang Shia, fighting for Lia and seizing\na glimmer of hope for Lia's future. As\nfor the ancient demons, they are nothing\nbut rats hiding in the shadows. Apart\nfrom their fallen ancient civilizations\nand the wealth they left behind, they\npose no threat whatsoever. Now, Lynn\nShiao is connected to the ancient\ndemons, but he only obtained an ancient\ndivine sword made by the ancient demons.\nI am confident that I am the only one in\nthe world who can recognize the crimson\nsky sword. The stunningly beautiful\nwoman narrowed her eyes. So you mean\nthis matter is known only to heaven,\nearth, you and me. As long as we don't\ntell anyone, no one will know. Jabbron\nlowered his voice slightly. Lord of the\ndomain, when I was young, I was also a\nwandering knight errant. I like to use\nsharp knives, even though there is a\nrisk of cutting my hands. Lynn Shiao has\ngained the support of the ancient\ndemons, which shows that he has\nunlimited potential. However, he is\nstill very weak at the moment. We can\ncontinue to monitor him, win him over,\nand absorb him. You're even more radical\nthan Shu Yusi. Aren't you afraid of\nasking a tiger for its skin by doing\nthis? We have no choice, Lord. If we\ncontinue to lose, the Dragon Sa Kingdom\nwill become a second rate nation within\n50 years, and the Dragon Sea domain will\nbe annexed by the Eastern Inmain. Faced\nwith the fate of my nation, I am willing\nto take the risk. Besides, the prophecy\nhas supported my judgment. Is that so?\nUpon hearing the news that the dragon\nkingdom was deteriorating, the beautiful\nwoman's side again. Tell me your\nthoughts on how to get through this Lynn\nSha matter. After all, he is related to\nancient demons. If he is not careful and\nhis identity is exposed, not only will\nhe be doomed, but our Lang Shia kingdom\nwill also suffer a catastrophic\ndisaster. Lord Dugu, there is an\nopportunity right now. Khalil Jibron\ncalmly replied, using a few smaller\nproblems to cover up the real big\nproblems. You mean the demons? Exactly.\nLyn Xiao's problem right now is that he\nis too powerful for a novice lord. And\nthis power is suspicious. If Lin Sha\nreally has an unclear relationship with\nthe demon race, then his power can be\nexplained. We just need to give some\nofficial responses that are neither here\nnor there. give Lynn Shiao some overt\nsupport and declare that Lin Shiao has\nno connection with the demon race. That\nway, other countries won't be able to\ncause trouble in the shadows. The rumors\nof Lin Xiao's collusion with the demons\nwill not disappear, and the rumors will\ncontinue to spread, but at least his\nrelationship with the ancient demons has\nbeen covered up. The stunningly\nbeautiful woman pondered for a moment,\nthen nodded emphatically. Okay,\nwe&lt;unk&gt;ll do as you say. I'll also\ncontact Lin Sha myself and meet with\nhim. Then I shall take my leave. Long\nafter Jabbrron left, a cold, quiet voice\nsounded softly. The crisis in the Dragon\nSa Kingdom is getting more and more\nserious. Chu Yusi doesn't care about the\ndemons and Jibron doesn't even care\nabout the ancient demons. They are\nwilling to fight for any chance of\nsurvival. Khalil Jabbron, my first\nprophet, truly values Lynn Shiao. His\nviews on the ancient demons also\nsurprised me. Although he tried his best\nto hide it, I could still sense that he\ndid not harbor any hostility towards the\nancient demons. Does he know something,\ntoo? Meanwhile, Khalil Jabbron, back at\nhis residence, also sighed. He smiled\nand shook his head, then poured himself\na glass of wine. It's really tiring to\nplay riddles with the domain lord. She\nalso knows the truth about the ancient\ndemons. And I also know the truth about\nthe ancient demons. But she doesn't know\nthat I know. And I know that she knows.\nWe can't talk about this taboo topic,\nand we have to find a respectable reason\nto resolve Linhao's matter perfectly.\nKhalil Jabbron slowly poured the wine\ninto his mouth, looking out the window\ninto the distance. I don't like playing\nriddles. Lynn Shiao shook his head with\na smile and asked Pay Min. Pay Min, just\ntell me straight. How were your gains\nfrom this battle? At this moment, only\nLynn Shiao and his few heroes were in\nthe war hall. His vassal lords had all\nbeen left outside. Whether to divide the\nspoils or how much to give to one's\nvassal lords is entirely up to one's own\ndecision. If one doesn't let them in,\nthen one won't feel resentful after\nseeing it. Yes, my lord, pay replied.\nThe spoils of this great war, including\nvarious resources, mines, gold coins,\nexperience points, and energy from the\nbattlefield of 10,000 races, have all\nbeen collected directly by the system\nand have entered the system warehouse.\nLord, you can check them at any time. A\nsword, a set of heavy armor, several\ntalismans, a bottle of potion, and a\ncard were dropped from Black Flame's\nbody. Please take a look, Lord. After\nsaying that, Pay Min pointed to the\nchopping board in front of him, on which\nwere neatly arranged the items he had\nmentioned. Lyn Sha picked up the sword\nand glanced at it briefly. Sword in the\nstone, epic weapon. Attributes: Base\nattack power 530, strength plus 25,\nconstitution plus 25. Description: Only\nthe king can pull the sword from the\nsolid stone. The sword in the stone was\nKing Arthur s sword and it provided a\nbonus to cavalry when worn. The sword in\nthe stone has average stats typical of\nepic swords. It is worth noting that the\nsword in the stone also has a trump card\nskill summon sword spirit. Just as black\nflame said once the sword spirit appears\nit will slaughter for miles around and\nonly return after drinking enough blood.\nHowever, the skill bar for summoning the\nsword spirit is currently black and\ncannot be activated, and there is also a\nline of small text on the system\nintroduction screen. The blade spirit is\nfrightened and cannot be summoned\ntemporarily. What a weak sword spirit.\nLyn Shiao casually made a comment, then\nchecked the entire set of the excellent\nquality dragon roar heavy armor set.\nAgain, it was slightly damaged, but O\nYzi said it could be repaired. The\ntalismans included consumables such as\nthe heavenly eye talisman, camp\ntalisman, and rapid marching talisman,\nwhile the potion was a bottle of life\nrestoring potion. It seems that black\nflame was killed before he could even\ntake it. Only one card remains. This\ncard has intricate patterns and details\nalong its edges, making it more\nexquisite than even the finest tarot\ncards. The entire card is like a work of\nart, depicting a stunningly beautiful\nangel. Lynn Sha picked up the card and\nthe information given by the main god\nnaturally entered his mind. Mythical\ncard angel. The holder of this card will\ngain the authority to recruit the\nmythical unit angel. Chapter 131. Ba is\nindeed suspicious. A mythical level\ncard. Does the holder of this card gain\nthe authority to recruit angels? Does\nthat mean recruiting angels requires\nthis prerequisite? Also, are angels a\nmythical quality unit? How come black\nflame has this on him? A series of\nquestions popped into Lin Xiao's mind.\nIn the school curriculum, the highest\nquality is golden legend. There has\nnever been any mythical quality. But the\nmysterious and powerful angels can\noccasionally be heard in rumors on the\nstreets and alleys, and sometimes they\nalso appear in classic western battles,\nplaying a decisive role. Lynn Sha once\nasked his course teacher what quality an\nangel was, but the result was a sigh\nfrom the gray-haired teacher and the\nmeaningful words. Anyway, it's not on\nthe exam, so don't know too much. Now, a\nbrand new and beautiful card is placed\nin front of him, and in an instant,\nLiao's question of many years was\nanswered. So, angels are mythical\nqualities. Mythology was never mentioned\nin Lia's courses. Could it be yet\nanother instance of foreign powers\nsuppressing and monopolizing advanced\nknowledge in Liao? As he talked to\nhimself, Lyn Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s hand kept\ncaressing the gorgeous angel card. My\nlord, this card is generated after the\ncorpses of black flame and all fallen\nlegendary and epic units reached their\nexpiration time. Pay Min explained from\nthe side. It should be one of the\ncampaign rewards. I see. No wonder Black\nFlame, a penniless guy, would have a\nmythic card hidden away and never use\nit, yet still carry it with him. Lyn\nShia understood and immediately checked\nthe battle results panel of the main god\nsystem. You and your vassel lord have\nsuccessfully withstood the challenge\nfrom Black Flame, a player from the\nofficial zone, and his subordinate\nlords. The rewards are as follows.\nBattle results. 65 bosses killed,\nincluding Black Flame, level 63. Enemy\nheroes eliminated\n131. Among them, one epic quality hero,\nMaster E. One superior quality hero,\nNeagano the Predator, and several rare\nquality heroes. Annihilate the following\nenemies. 100 Templar knights, legendary,\n300 ironclad crusaders, epic. 200\nSunfire Spearmen, epic. 100 Sunless Long\nBowman, epic. 100 Shadow Lurkers, epic.\n200 dwarven mountain warriors, epic, and\n58 exalted slayers. Excellent. Battle\nduration, 7 hours, 21 minutes, and 18\nseconds. Our casualties, player Lin\nShiao, Zero, Subordinate Lords, Tu, Shan\nby Chin, 239. He 419, Chin Ningming 93.\nSpecial stacking events include breaking\nthrough the zone to challenge the lord\npersonally participating in the battle,\nthe difference in level between the\nlords and troops of the two sides\nexceeding 10 levels. A battle involving\nmore than a thousand people and the\nchallenger being perfectly killed.\nrewards. Epic weapon, sword in the\nstone, excellent quality set, dragon\nsroar, heavy armor set, damaged, two\nrapid march charms, one heavenly eye\ncharm, one camp charm, 10 million\nexperience capped for a single battle in\nthe beginner zone. 1 million gold\ncapped, 50,000 energy. Lyn Sha quickly\nskimmed through the settlement reward\npage. Unlike fighting wild monsters,\nwhen fighting a lord, the victor will\nlikely obtain the equipment and weapons\nthe enemy is carrying after defeating\nthem, but treasure chests and the like\nwill generally not be obtained in this\nmajor operation. Apart from Black Flame\ndropping some good equipment, most of\nthe other blood lords dropped rare or\neven lower quality items which Lynn Shia\ndidn't even bother with and simply threw\ninto the god space warehouse to deal\nwith later. Defeating lords of the same\nkind yields the most experience and\ngold. After winning a single battle, Lyn\nSha directly receive the maximum reward\nof 10 million experience points and 1\nmillion gold coins in the newbie zone.\nThis experience is enough for him to\ndirectly upgrade all heroes and units to\nlevel 30 so that he can enter the\nofficial server in the best possible\ncondition. The Hasha Order also provided\n50,000 units of energy, which excited\nLyn Shao greatly, giving him many more\noptions when recruiting heroes or having\nimperial spirits possess him next time.\nAfter looking around, Lyn Sha frowned\nslightly. The battle results never\nmentioned the reward of the mythical\ncard angel. Lyn Sha has an amazing\nmemory, but he has no choice but to look\nat it again. Still none. Why wasn't the\nangel card reward shown? Is it because\nother countries are blocking advanced\nknowledge from the dragon sia domain? Do\nthey not want such advanced knowledge\nlike the mythical level to flow into\ndragon sia? Is it because the mythic\nquality is blocked in the newbie zone?\nThat shouldn't be the case. The god\nsystem already showed the contents of\nthe mythic card when I held it. Lyn Sha\npaced back and forth holding the cards\nin his hand. As he held the card in his\nhand, the god system naturally issued a\nnotification. A mythic quality card has\nbeen detected. Activating it will grant\nyou recruitment privileges. Activate\nnow. As a time traveler who has\nexperienced great ups and downs in\nanother world and knows a part of\nancient history, including how the\nancient Chinese people of Earth were\nbetrayed by other countries in this\nworld. Lyn Shia has to be wary of this\ncard that he suddenly acquired. Angels\nin every game and mythology are\nincomparably powerful beings. Once the\ncard is activated, I will gain the\nability to recruit angels. Won't that\ngive me a powerful ally in the battle\nfor supremacy among all races? Faced\nwith such temptation, Lyn Sha was\nfinding it hard to resist. Suddenly, Lyn\nSha remembered something. He looked up\nand gazed at a stunningly beautiful\nwoman standing quietly in the hall. Ba,\ncome here. Since consummating her\nrelationship with Lynn Shiao, Baoi has\nbecome even more radiant and beautiful.\nHowever, her gentle and unassuming\nnature means that she always stands\nquietly behind Lin Sha and never takes\nthe initiative to show off. Baoi, still\nwearing the forest which cloak that Lin\nSha had given her, obediently came to\nLin Sha. Check Ba's attributes. Ba race\nhuman ancient China quality myth level\nLevel two attributes strength 68 spirit\n65 constitution 71 soul 105 skills charm\nSrank a smile worth a thousand pieces of\ngold Srank beauty that could cause\ndisaster a rank peerless beauty Srank\ntwo elements reversal Srank peerless\ndemoness click to\nCombat power rating 85 stars not yet\nunlocked. Exclusive unit songstress.\nLynsha thought to himself. Just as I\nexpected. Unbeknownst to them, all the\ncontent replaced by question mark has\nbeen displayed. Baoi, who is only level\ntwo, has incredibly high stats, even\nsurpassing Pay Min, the king of\none-on-one combat. Ba's qualities are\nactually mythical. What is this?\nStarting out an ancient demon forces a\npeerless demoness of mythical quality to\nbe his concubine. Lyn Sha glanced at Ba\nagain, his eyes filled with shock and\nsurprise, which puzzled Baoi. My lord,\nwhat's wrong with me? No, it's&lt;unk&gt;\nnothing. You're great. You're getting\nmore and more beautiful. Liao&lt;unk&gt;s lips\ncurled up slightly. If it weren't for\nthe presence of so many subordinates, he\nwould have loved to pick up Baoi and\nspin her around a few times. There's no\nrush to go around in circles. We can go\naround in other places tonight. However,\nby checking Bao's attributes, Lynn Shiao\nconfirmed one thing. The mythical\nquality had already been unlocked for\nhim. Therefore, if there are items of\nmythical quality, he can certainly\nexamine them. However, the reward list\nprovided by the god system does not\ninclude any angel cards, which means\nthere's definitely something wrong with\nthis angel card. I happen to have some\ntime now, Lynsha said. All heroes and\nsquad leaders, go and keep watch in the\nterritory. There may be an attack on the\nterritory later. Protect the territory.\nProtect my vassal lords. Lynn Sha\npaused. Also, no one is allowed to enter\nthe war hall to disturb me without my\npermission. Ba, you stay. Chapter 132.\nPay men, the gossip king, and the traps\nof the traitor. Ba stayed behind and the\nothers left. Pay Min's ears perked up.\nHe tilted his head slightly, looked at\nTangg Yi, and then at S Rui, who was\nputting on his helmet. Huing and Shin\nLeong Yu acted swiftly and decisively,\nimmediately going out to arrange\nmilitary affairs. O Yi had already taken\nthe damaged armor to repair it. He was a\nworkaholic. Tang Yi pursed his lips,\nignored Pay Min's gaze, and walked out\nas well. Hey, it's only evening. Lord,\nwhat are you planning to do? Pay\nMinudged Son Ruer. Song Rui slammed down\nhis face plate and neck flap, then\nwalked away without looking to the side.\nBoring. Pay secretly turned his head and\nsaw that Lin Sha had already grasped\nBao's soft hand. Ba blushed with\nembarrassment and almost lowered her\nhead to the ground. Mr. Pay Min, why\naren't you leaving yet? Soldering with\nhis long ears came over. The Lord must\nhave important matters to attend to with\nBa, so let's not waste our time. After\nsaying that, Soldering pulled Pay Min\nout of the war hall. Pay Min suppressed\na laugh as he walked out of the hall and\nsuddenly asked, \"Soldin, what urgent\nmatter does the Lord need to attend to?\nI don't know what's inside the war\nhall.\" The war hall is quite empty with\nonly a sand table, a task board, and\nsome chairs, but we usually hold\nmeetings standing up. Does Mr. Pay Min\nhave any deeper meaning in asking this?\nThere's no deeper meaning behind it.\nSeeing Solderland's confusion, Pay Min\nleaned closer, seemingly about to speak\nmysteriously. Pay Min, get lost. If I\never hear you gossiping about me again,\nI'll confiscate all your frosts and fire\njoy. Lyn Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s voice echoed from\nthe hall. Payman shuddered and slunk\naway. This kid is great in every way,\nexcept he loves to gossip. It's time to\nfind him a companion. Lyn Sha shook his\nhead and said to Baoi, who was blushing\nshily in his arms. This kind of\nwandering night errant won't settle down\nuntil he meets the right person. I\nwonder what kind of woman he actually\nlikes. Lyn Shiao actually started\nworrying about Pay Min's important\nmatter. How fortunate I am to have met\nyou, my lord. Ba nestled her face\nagainst Lin Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s chest, blushing\nas she spoke these sweet words. I will\nfulfill any request of your lord. Lynsha\nclicked his tongue. This vixen's mind\nwasn't pure. She always used the most\ninnocent expression and demeanor yet\nuttered seductive words. In the\nfashionable terms of before his\ntransmigration, she was a pure desire\ntype. Ba, we're going to take care of\nimportant business. Lyn Sha took Ba's\nhand and said earnestly, would you like\nto meet your old acquaintance? Oh. While\nBaoi was still in surprise, Lin Shiao\nrecited the secret code. Lin Bing Doha\nJa Jean Li Shen Shing. In an instant,\nthe world spun around. Lyn Sha and Ba\nappeared in an unknown place. There were\nbuildings and houses that were both real\nand elucory. A chaotic sky, a broken\nearth, and cold winds blowing through\nthe fragmented air. chaos, decay,\nsecrecy, and stranges. Between the\noverlapping real and elucory buildings,\nsome figures like black mist drifted\nabout. This is the hiding place of\nancient demons. Bowsi exclaimed in\nsurprise. Yes, let's come and see our\nold friend. Lyn Sha gently patted Ba's\nhand, comforting her to calm down. Both\nof them were consciousness entities,\nonly able to drift with the wind. But\nstrangely, there was still a shining\nspot on Lin Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s chest. A moment\nlater, three dark figures drifted over.\nLyn Shiao opened his mouth to speak. He,\nthe second shadowy figure, spoke first,\ncatching Lin Xiao's greeting in his\nthroat. Ouch. The leader of the shadowy\nfigures, smacked the second in command\nhard on the head. All you do is laugh\nlike that all day long. Do you think\nyoung friend Lyn Sha would try to steal\nyour laugh? Lyn Sha could only chuckle\nawkwardly. This second brother really\nheld a grudge. He hadn't forgotten the\ntime he stole his lines. Three dark\nfigures approached Lin Shia and Baoi. Uh\nBaoi, young friend, Lyn Sha brought you\nalong, too. The leader of the shadowy\nfigures nodded to Baoi. Baoi greets the\nthree seniors and thanks them for their\nkindness in giving her a second chance\nat life. Ba's consciousness bowed to the\nthree dark figures filled with\ngratitude. No need to be polite. The\nleader of the shadowy figures was the\nmost composed. As fellow Chinese, it is\nonly right that we help each other.\nYoung friend Lyn Shia, what brings you\nhere? We heard that your troubles should\nbe resolved. Lyn Sha smiled slightly and\nsaid, \"Mere Black Flame and Templar\nKnights are easy prey for my Chinese\ntroops.\" \"Excellent. That's the might of\nour ancient demons back in the day.\" The\nleader of the shadowy figures exclaimed\nin admiration. But this time, I have two\nquestions that I need to ask some senior\ncolleagues. The second shadowy figure\nsneered. I think you mean the old devil.\nSpeak. The third shadowy figure kept\nstaring at the light on Lin Xiao's\nchest, waiting for Lin Xiao's next\nquestion. Actually, these two questions\ncan also be the same. One is, what is\nmythical quality? Secondly, what about\nthis card and can I use it? Lyn Xiao's\nconsciousness took out the angel card\nfrom his pocket. The moment the angel\ncard was taken out, it shone brightly\nwithout the obstruction of Linhao's\nconsciousness, illuminating even the\nentire chaotic dark space. The three\nfigures in black were taken aback at\nfirst, then jumped back as if facing a\nformidable enemy. \"This is a trap set by\ntraitors.\" The shadowy leader shouted.\n\"Have you activated the card?\" \"No!\" Lin\nShiao said in a deep voice. \"If there's\na problem, I'll go back immediately.\"\nHearing Lyn Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s reply that it\nwasn't activated, the leader of the\nshadowy figures breathed a sigh of\nrelief. Three dark figures slowly moved\nforward and came to Lyn Sha. If you\nactivate it now, it's too late to go\nback. The traitors may have already\nlocated our position. We will have to\nabandon this place where we have been\nhiding for many years and find a new\nspace-time rift. Lynho&lt;unk&gt;s expression\nwas serious. What exactly is going on\nwith these cards? What's honey to others\nis poison to you, the leader of the\nshadowy figure's side. I never expected\nthat you would obtain such an advanced\nitem while still in the newbie zone and\nalso encounter such a huge risk. Let me\nstart from the beginning. In the\nsupremacy, all equipment and all troop\ntypes have six well-known quality\nlevels: common, fine, rare, excellent,\nepic, and legendary. You may have\nwondered the lord talent has six levels\nF, F, C, D, A, B, and C. F level\ncorresponds to ordinary. The powerful A\nlevel can correspond to legendary, but\nthere are a very few geniuses with\nS-level lord talent. Does S level also\ncorrespond to golden legend? That's what\nthe textbook says, Lynn Sha said calmly.\nHowever, some S-level talents are above\nlegendary. Alas, these toxic textbooks\nare harming future generations. The\nleader of the shadowy figures cried out\nin anguish. It's all the work of those\ntraitors who manipulated the culture. A\npowerful A- rank talent can indeed\ncorrespond to a golden legendary talent,\nbut an S-rank talent corresponds to\nsomething above golden legendary,\nmythical quality. Mythical quality is an\nultimate quality across all realms, a\nlevel higher than golden legendary. The\nthird shadowy figure interjected.\nHowever, mythical quality is extremely\nrare, whether in the ninth heaven or the\nthird heaven. Mythical quality is the\nbest in all realms. It can be said that\nthe golden legend is the emperor of the\nmortal world who can already dominate\nthe world, while the mythical quality is\nthe ethereal god in the heavens who can\nonly be encountered by chance. So, I've\nstruck gold, Lyn Sha asked doubtfully.\nRome, you've stepped into a trap\nmeticulously designed by the traitors. A\ntrap specifically designed to target\ngeniuses. Regardless of whether you can\ngather all the materials needed to\nrecruit angels. The moment you activate\nthis card, you will be located, watched,\nand marked, and you will never be able\nto escape the gaze of the traitors.\nChapter 133. Modifying a semi- divine\nartifact. Being located, marked, and\nwatched with no escape. Lynn Sha frowned\nand said, \"Does it have to be this\nCthulhuesque? What did you say?\" \"Oh,\nit's nothing. Please continue.\" My\nbrother said that these angel cards are\na carefully designed trap by the\ntraitors, but also a honey for others,\nand there's a reason for that. The third\nshadowy figure continued to explain,\n\"The angel cards were jointly produced\nby the traitorous nations of Western\nEurope. They monopolized the recruitment\nauthority for angel units. Without their\nconsent, no one can obtain the\nqualification to recruit angel units or\neven have the chance to see an angel. In\norder to make the best use of the\nangel's mystery, powerful attraction,\nand deterrent effect, the\nbehind-the-scenes controllers of Western\nEurope have come up with a vicious\nmethod. They will implant some kind of\nmagical mark that will soon dissipate on\ntheir most powerful legendary and epic\nunits, with only a tiny bit attached to\neach unit. When a legendary or epic unit\nis defeated, a magical mark will be\ntriggered. However, the small amount of\nmagical mark will dissipate quickly and\nnothing will happen. Only when the rate\nof death is fast enough, the number of\ndeaths is large enough and the deaths\nare rapid, numerous, and dense can these\nmagical marks be gathered together. When\nmore and more magical symbols converge\nand reach a critical value, they can\ntrigger the magic they have set up in\nadvance, which will directly send a\nmythical card from their base. \"Do you\nknow why they did this?\" Mark the\ngenius, Lyn Sha said in a deep voice.\n\"That's right,\" the leader of the\nshadowy figures nodded. \"Being able to\nkill a large number of specific gold\nlegendary units or even more specific\nepic units in a short period of time can\nonly mean one thing. The killer has very\nstrong strength and can be considered a\npeerless genius. In fact, the last time\ncards were given out in the entire\nDragon summer domain was 20 years ago,\nwhich is enough to show how difficult it\nis to meet the conditions. Once the\nconditions are met, the Western European\ndomain will give out a mythic quality\ncard as loot for the killer. When a\nnormal person encounters such a good\nthing as a windfall, of course, they\nwould activate the card immediately.\nThen they will be marked by the magical\neffects on the cards and watched by the\nperson behind the scenes. Lyn Shao\ncontinued in a deep voice. If this\ngenius is someone the people behind the\nscenes are willing to cultivate and who\nis also willing to join them, he will be\ngiven special attention. But from then\non he will be nothing more than a dog of\nWestern Europe. If this genius is\nconsidered an enemy of Western Europe,\nor if the person behind the scenes is\nunwilling to cultivate him, then he will\nface extermination. What a vicious and\nmeticulously planned trap. Lyn Xiao's\nface was as cold as a stone. That's\nright. So now you know why we reacted so\nstrongly just now, right? The leader of\nthe shadows said, still shaken. We've\nbeen hiding for thousands of years, and\nwe can't afford to wander again. If your\ncard is active, it's very likely that\nyou're being watched by something behind\nthe scenes. Lynn Shia said\napologetically. I'm really sorry. I'll\nbe more careful in the future. I'll\ncontact you before entering this space.\nI will not bring items here rashly\nagain. Although Lin Shia and Baoi are\nconsciousness entities, they can carry\nitems when they enter the demons hideout\nusing the incantations given by the\nancient demons. As long as it's not\nactivated, it doesn't matter much. The\ntop members of the betrayers faction are\nvery busy. They won't be checking cards\nevery day that they might only use once\nevery few decades, said the second\nshadowy figure. The leader of the\nshadowy figures nodded as well. This\nangel card. Otherwise, you can give it\nto us. The third shadowy figure said, \"I\nhaven't seen a mythical quality item in\nyears. We can silently remove the magic\non it.\" Then he the third shadowy figure\nlaughed. I can use the sliver of\ndivinity on this one card to attach to\nlegendary quality equipment and create a\nsemi- divine artifact. A semi- divine\nartifact? Linhao's eyes lit up. Yes, the\nsemi- divine artifact you create will\nstill be yours. If you have more items\nimbued with divinity, you can ask us\nagain and then take them over. Speaking\nof divinity, Lynn Shaol laughed. What's\nthe deal with my bow? The stunningly\nbeautiful woman standing to the side was\nboth shy and delighted when Lin Shiao\ncalled her my families and she was at a\nloss for words. Why are you asking us\nwhat's going on with your Bousy? We\ndidn't put any surveillance magic on\nher. Shut up. The leader of the shadowy\nfigures interrupted the second brother's\nchatter with another sharp wrap on the\nhead. He approached Lin Shia and Baoi,\nthe hazy shadowy figure getting close to\nthe two of them, looking left and right.\nLin Shiao seemed to faintly smell a\nfaint scent of alcohol. The situation is\nmore optimistic than I imagined. The\nshadowy elder said Baoi is a mythical\nhero, but she is affected by negative\nluck and cannot unleash her full\npotential. Now that the negative luck\nhas been diluted to a critical point,\nher attributes have become apparent. Of\ncourse, this is also because you\nobtained a mythic level card and\nunlocked the mythic quality. I don't\nknow what method you used to change this\npoor girl. so much, but you've done a\ngood job. Keep it up. We're not sure how\nmuch potential Baoi has.\" Upon hearing\nthe leader's words, Baoi looked at Lin\nShia with eyes full of love and\nsubconsciously reached out to hold Lin\nXiao&lt;unk&gt;s arm tightly, refusing to let\ngo. Lyn Sha also affectionately patted\nBaosi's hand. \"By the way, how can I\nrecruit mythical quality units in the\nfuture? The West has angels, but does\nChina have mythical quality units?\" Liao\nasked.\nThe second shadowy figure scoffed. You\nunderestimate our ancient demon race. We\nwere once the demons of countless realms\nwho fought our way up to the third\nheaven. How could we not have mythical\nquality troops? Just focus on fighting\nand grinding monsters to grow stronger.\nAs long as you trigger the god's\nmythical quality reward, the China token\ncan change that reward to China's. He\nremember this. My Chinese golden legend\ncan crush the western golden legend and\nmy Chinese mythology can crush their\nmythology. Then I'm relieved. Lyn Sha\nnodded. Thank you. Three seniors Ba and\nI will head back now. Wait. The leader\nof the shadowy figures called out to Lyn\nSha. You did a good job in this battle.\nI didn't expect you to be so shrewd. Not\nonly did you use the nest demon pets to\nattract attention, but you also made\ncontact with Andrea and laid out your\nplan long ago. staging a double act. I\nunderstand your plan. Use the demons and\nAndrea to create confusion and cover up\nthe truth. Stop. Stop. Lyn Sha felt\nincreasingly uneasy as he listened. What\nare you talking about? What? Andrea?\nWho? Chapter 134. Three denials dividing\nthe spoils. Both sides stood there\nstunned. You haven't contacted Andrea?\nWho exactly is Andrea? The two said in\nunison. It's that demon princess you had\na rumored affair with the leader of the\nshadowy figures touched his nose.\nEmbarrassed, you started to trick Andrea\nwithout even contacting her. You truly\nare a descendant of our ancient demons.\nMe? Haven't I been constantly being\ntricked by this succubus princess? Lyn\nSha was both amused and exasperated. She\nhas a subordinate who always claims that\nI forcibly took someone's virginity. I\nonly saw her once from afar, and she\neven set a trap for me. interrupting my\ngood time with Ba. I was just playing\nalong, using the demons as scapegoats. A\ncollaboration between me and her. That's\nimpossible. You must have been misled by\nthe rumors spread by that abyss demon.\nLyn Sha denied it three times. But I\nremember it was a bloodthirsty witch\nfrom your valley who said it to the live\nstream. Lyn Shia, all right, the leader\nof the shadowy figures ended the\ndispute. Whether you cooperated with her\nor sabotaged her, the results this time\nwere quite good. You're about to enter\nthe official zone. Remember, you need to\nbe extra careful. You must hide yourself\nuntil you're strong enough. Using the\ndemon race as a cover is dangerous, but\nit's much safer than directly revealing\nthat you are a member of the ancient\ndemons. Lynn Shia, wait, when did I\nbecome one of the ancient demons? The\nshadowy leader said, \"You are Chinese\nand your wife Ba is also Chinese.\nChinese people are ancient demons, so\nyou are an ancient demon. Take care, my\nfellow ancient demons. I'd rather\nsacrifice my looks for that succubus\nprincess than give up my life.\" Lyn Sha,\ngo for it, young friend. We look forward\nto seeing your performance in the\nofficial server. The leader of the\nshadowy figures waved his hand, and Lin\nShia and Baoi felt dizzy again. But\nafter a few seconds, their consciousness\nreturned to their bodies. In the\ndistance outside the hall, a commotion\nhad already broken out. It seemed that\nthe meeting with the ancient demons had\nonce again triggered an attack, and the\nheroes of the territory had begun to\norganize a defense. Lynn Shiao touched\nhis chest. The beautifully designed\nangel card had disappeared. It's an\nincredible ability. Lynn Sha pondered\nthe strength of the three ancient\ndemonic figures and secretly assessed\njust how powerful the traitors were who\ncould make the three figures flee in\nsuch a sorry state. Lyn Sha rubbed his\nchin. If his identity were really\nexposed, his fate would not be much\nbetter than that of the ancient demon.\nHe is indeed Chinese, albeit in another\nworld. But in this world that views\nChinese people as a monstrous threat,\nthe traitors will likely not listen to\nhis explanation. Therefore, Lyn Sha had\nno choice. From the moment he entered\nthe official zone, he was destined to\nbegin a cautious battle royale. Is that\ndemon princess named Andrea? I'll find a\nchance to ask our well-informed class\nmonitor about it. Having gotten rid of\nthe hot potato that is the angel card,\nit's time to meet with my subordinate\nlords, settle everyone in, and head to\nthe official server in a couple of days,\nLynn Sha led Bao Sea out of the warh\nhall. Outside the territory, wave after\nwave of beast tides fiercely attacked.\nHowever, under the defense organized by\nHoing and Chin Leong Yu, Lin Sha felt no\nthreat. Within the territory, two Shawn\nBachin and Heay each had a bag of melon\nseeds and watched with great interest as\ntheir lord's heroic troops fought\nagainst the overwhelming demonic tide.\nHeay would occasionally jokingly ask\nwhen the flower fairy beside him would\nbecome as strong as the mo Dao iron\nguard. Chun Ningming placed his hand on\nhis weapon, his expression calm, as he\ncontinued to patrol the territory. Ding\nLay stood the furthest away, but he only\ncrossed his arms and watched everything\nthat was happening in his territory from\nafar. Upon seeing Lyn Sha emerge, the\ngroup turned around and greeted him.\nBoss, boss Lyn Shao, big brother. Lyn\nSha waved his hand, signaling everyone\nto come closer. Everyone, Dinglay is now\nmy vassel lord. So from now on, we're\nall on the same side. Although Dinglay\nwas being pretentious, he didn't\nactually cause any real harm to Tan by\nChin and the others. So they quickly\naccepted the reality and shook hands\nwith Dinglay to make peace. Seeing Tu\nShan by Chin and the others looking at\nhim with puzzled expressions, Lynn Sha\nchuckled. I know what you want to ask,\nbut I'll just tell you all. Don't ask\nanything about my heroes and units. The\nmore you know, the more dangerous it is\nfor you. When the time is right, I will\ntell you. Let the rumors go. I don't\ncare. Lyn Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s face turned cold.\nAnd he slowly said, \"This time, I killed\nBlack Flame and killed a thousand\nexpensive soldiers. The Celestial\nOrganization will not let me go.\"\nAccording to Dingle, Hi Yin can only be\nconsidered an ordinary elite in the\nCelestial People Organization. His\nsuperior is Wong Su, a masked man who\nonce stood up for Gene Dang. Wong\nSu&lt;unk&gt;s superior is Pu Dawei, the\nleader of the Celestial People. Once I\nenter the official zone, the celestial\norganization, the lords who covet my\ntroops, the lords who want to become\nfamous, and countless bloodthirsty lords\nwill relentlessly track and hunt me\ndown. Lyn Sha turned to look at the\ngroup and said, \"These things originally\nhad nothing to do with you, and you\nshouldn't have gotten involved, so I'm\ngiving you a chance. If you're scared,\nyou can leave now, and I'll terminate\nthe contract.\" Dinglay, you're the same.\nThe group exchanged glances. Tu Shan\nBachin was the first to speak, saying,\n\"Brother Lin Sha, without you, we would\nhave died on the battlefield long ago.\nFew of those who come to the battlefield\nof the myriad races are afraid of death.\nI will follow you. Although it sounds\nvery dangerous to you, danger always\ncomes with opportunity. I really want to\nimprove.\" He and Chin Ningming nodded,\nexpressing their determination. Lyn Sha\nlooked at Ding Lay, who slowly said,\n\"Brother Shiao, you understand me. I\ncan't survive if I don't pretend. I can\nonly pretend if I'm with you. Imagine me\nfollowing you to defeat a powerful enemy\nand then delivering that exhilarating\nline in front of everyone. That scene,\nthat's the life I want. Lynn Shia raised\nhis hand and touched his forehead. You\nlearn very quickly. All right, since\nyou're all willing to follow me, then\nget ready to face the brutal challenges\nof the official zone together. Lynn Shao\nopened his God system warehouse and\npulled out a long list of equipment of\nexcellent quality and below. Each of you\nmay choose five pieces of equipment from\nall of these. Wow, brother Lyn Sha is\nincredibly rich. Tu Shan by Chian\nexclaimed dramatically. Lyn Sha casually\nflicked Tu Sha by Chians forehead with\nhis hand. These were all dropped by the\nblood lords we just killed in this\nbattle. As my underlings, I can't treat\nyou unfairly. After you've made your\nselections, go back to your own\nterritories and develop rapidly. See\nwhat resources your territories lack to\nupgrade your lord's manner and just tell\nme. Yay! Brother Lyn Shiao is so good to\nus. Tu Shan by Chen, the little girl in\nwhite stockings jumped up and grabbed\nLyn Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s arm. Then let's start\nchoosing. Lyn Sha withdrew his arm\nwithout making a sound, although he had\nto admit that the little girl was indeed\nvery well-developed. Get out of here\nafter you've made your selection.\nChapter 135 Kman protection fee 89757\nnewb zone. The great battle between Lin\nShiao and Black Flame which shocked the\nentire Lnon region and even more or less\naffected the entire Lia domain ended\nafter the war. The remaining new lords\ncontinued with their daily tasks,\noccasionally mentioning the excitement\nof the great battle and its unbelievable\nending while diligently accumulating\nresources, grinding monsters, recruiting\ntroops, upgrading their lord's manor,\nand methodically preparing for the third\nlevel and entry into the official\nserver. When the black flames descended,\nthe god system gave a 3-day lockdown\nperiod during which no one could enter\nthe official area. Lyn Sha and Black\nFlame are fighting fiercely. It's like\ngods are fighting. I don't understand it\nat all, but for me, it's more practical\nto just grind monsters and level up my\nlord's manner. Someone was chatting in\nthe L non- newbie chat channel during\ntheir free time. That's right. Such wars\nare just something to look at. They're\ntoo far removed from our lives. If\nBlackflame releases an epic unit, I'll\nhave no choice but to kneel down and\nadmit defeat. I only have one elite unit\nto put on a show, but it can't beat epic\nunits. You also have exceptional units.\nYou can be considered a hidden master.\nRemember how arrogant Xiao Datang and\nGene Dang were when they only had a few\nrare units. Haha. Everyone's standards\nin the newbie zone have been raised by\nLin Shiao. They don't even care about\nthe excellent troops anymore. Speaking\nof which, someone cautiously brought up\nthe topic, what kind of unit does boss\nLin Sha actually use? I looked through\nthe Encyclopedia of all races units\nyesterday, but I couldn't find a unit\nwith a similar description. Hey, why\nflip through that book? It's only\nrevised once every 10 years. Every year,\ncountless new and extinct troop types\nare created on the battlefield of 10,000\nraces. By the time it's included in the\ndictionary, some lords will have been\nkilled by these new troop types, and\ntheir graves will be over a meter high\nwith grass growing on them. That's true,\nbut I guess Lyn Xiao's troops are also\nself-created. Do you even need to tell\nme? Boss Lin Shiao himself said that the\nGust archers were trained and upgraded\nfrom phantom archers. The Cullinan Iron\nCavalry were trained and upgraded from\nstep knights, and the most powerful\nswordsmen called the Flash Spirit Iron\nGuards were trained and upgraded from\nBerserkers. I've heard about it, too.\nLyn Sha is really generous. He answered\nthe Gene family patriarchs question\nimmediately. He truly keeps his promise.\nWhat's strange is that Lynn Shiao claims\nhe trained all his self-created troop\ntypes while wearing overalls are sold\nout on the home planet. Many lords are\nusing their connections to have friends\nand relatives by overalls on the home\nplanet and teleport them over to put\nthem on their phantom archers and other\nunits. I heard that when all these\nsoldiers wear overalls for training,\nthey look quite impressive and have a\nunique kind of spectacular feel. Yes,\nboss Lin Sha also mentioned that\ntraining in overalls is a tradition\npassed down from the Kuan sect. This\nKuwin sect is an ancient sect, but I\ndon't understand what the Kuin and Kuwan\nsect means. You guys have a lot of free\ntime, huh? A loud shout interrupted the\nnovice lord's idol chatter. Did you pay\nyour protection money this week? You\nstill have time to chat here? The chat\nchannel paused for a moment. The\nconversation abruptly ended. Seeing that\nno one responded, the man continued\narrogantly. You ordinary lords shouldn't\nspend your days discussing and yearning\nfor the world of the big shots. What\ndoes that have to do with you? He's a\ngenius, a big shot, and most\nimportantly, he has powerful backers.\nOtherwise, how could an F-rank talent\nobtain so many powerful units and\nheroes, defeat top players in the\nofficial zone, and even epic units? Do\nyou understand? The most important thing\nis to have someone behind you. The\narrogant voice seemed pleased that no\none dared to contradict it and\ncontinued. Look at Xiao Dahong and his\ngroup. They have the heavenly people\norganization behind them. They can run\nrampant as soon as they enter the newbie\nzone. The three masters of Julie, King\nBo, Pen Shanu, and others are also\nmembers of a certain powerful force.\nLynn Shiao has an unclear relationship\nwith the Demon Clan and even has a Demon\nClan princess as his girlfriend. These\npeople are so strong because they have\npowerful connections. It has nothing to\ndo with your talent, hard work, passion,\nor fearlessness. And you? A bunch of\nmediocre lords with no money and no\npower. You can only be cannon fodder on\nthe battlefield of all races. So, you'd\nbetter obediently hand over your\nprotection money. Our organization is a\nmedium-sized organization in the\nofficial district, and we have experts\nat level 70 or 80 in the official\ndistrict. By paying us protection money,\nyou'll become one of our peripheral\nmembers, which will reduce a lot of\ntrouble for you. At least we won't\nextort you anymore. Understand? All\nright, stop doawling. Instead of\nchatting here, why don't you farm a few\nmore ways of monsters and collect the\nprotection fee as soon as possible?\nUnderstand? Sigh. someone side. But\nboss, your protection fee is too\nexpensive. It's almost as much as all\nthe materials I need to upgrade to level\ntwo. Just tell me if you're going to pay\nor not,\" the arrogant voice said.\nEveryone shook their heads silently, and\nthe chat channel became even more bleak\nand oppressive. Although Black Flame is\ndead, the shock he brought made more\npeople realize the power of the official\ndistrict organization. And there are\nmany people like the arrogant kid. I've\ntold you so many times, those with\ntalent join all the big organizations.\nThose who lack talent should obediently\nbecome dogs of large organizations. This\nis the correct way for most novice lords\nto survive. The arrogant voice\ncontinued. Stop talking nonsense and pay\nthe fee now. The chat channel fell\nsilent again. Our bloodlord in the\nnewbie zone was killed and the\ncelestials organization was severely\ndamaged. But there are still this\norganization. that organization and\ncountless other organizations. A novice\nlord side, what can I do? I'm desperate,\ntoo. We lords without power or money are\ntruly at the mercy of others. I really\ndon't want to pay. Stop talking\nnonsense. The arrogant voice roared.\nI'll teach you to talk nonsense. A\nmoment later. Ding. Newbie zone 89757.\nPlayer Le has been eliminated. Anyone\nelse want to talk nonsense? The arrogant\nvoice said, \"It's just killing one or\ntwo people. You only become a red name\nif you kill three. I have plenty of\nunderlings, more than enough. No, boss.\nWe'll pay. We'll pay.\" Okay. Everyone\nwas in despair. Lyn Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s epic\nbattle is ultimately irrelevant to us\ncommoner lords. Perhaps some were too\ndesperate to care about the threats of\nthe arrogant voices. One person side as\nhe paid the fee. We really can only be\ncanon fodder. This battlefield of the\nmyriad races is too dark. There isn't a\nsingle ray of light. He Let's not talk\nabout us. Someone added, \"Isn't even\nLynn Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s vassal lord just cannon\nfodder? Look at Heay and the beautiful\ngirl. Lyn Shia used them to wear down\nthe enemy. Their own base was raided and\nhundreds of soldiers were killed. It\nwill be difficult for them to enter the\nofficial area in the future. Even when\nLin Xiao's good friend Chufinga brought\nJu Lee and the others to support Lin\nShiao, didn't they only end up with\ntheir entire army wiped out and fleeing\nin disarray? That's right. So don't be\nsuperstitious about any big shots.\nFollowing any big shot will only lead to\nbeing a slave and cannon fodder. We\nordinary people can only keep a low\nprofile, swallow our anger, avoid\nprovoking powerful forces, and behave\nourselves. Dark. This world is\ndark. At that moment, a discordant voice\nsuddenly appeared. He who said following\nboss Lynn Shia means becoming canon\nfodder. Chapter 136 shocking everyone. I\nam the only light. He's remarks\nimmediately drew ridicule. He your\ntroops are almost all wiped out and\nyou're still smug about it. Yes, you're\nthe kind of person who gets sold out and\nthen counts the money for the seller.\nBig shots and such are completely\nunreliable. He curled his lip. H\nunreliable big shots are other people.\nOur boss Lin Shia is not that kind of\nperson. What else could he be but this\nkind of person? Although I admit he's\nvery capable. He didn't lose a single\nsoldier while you guys almost all died.\nIs it because Lyn Sha saved your life\nthat you're willing to be his dog? He's\na Damn. Lyn Sha really treats me like a\nfriend. Friends? Haha. What about his\nfriend Chufinga and Chufinga's friend\nJulie? With all the soldiers and heroes\ndead, will Lynn shall receive any\ncompensation? Heay shook his head\nhelplessly and continued. I finally\nunderstand what the boss meant by, \"I\npity their misfortune, but I'm angry at\ntheir lack of ambition. He was talking\nabout you guys.\" He immediately pulled\nout his equipment and sent it to the\nchat channel. He's a dragon's pine\nbreastplate, mighty bracers, berserker's\nblade. Click to view. See that? They're\nall top tier equipment, and I have\nseveral pieces myself. Boss Lin Sha\nshared quite a bit of the loot with us.\nAfter a few seconds of silence, the\narrogant voice of the person collecting\nthe insurance premiums rang out. H, the\nequipment is pretty good, but that's\nonly because boss Lin Sha killed over a\n100 blood lords and accumulated a lot of\nequipment. He's just giving you a few\npieces. But your territory has been\nraised to the ground. That's a fact. You\nlack troops. Your territory has been\ndestroyed. Even if you start over,\nyou'll be far behind others. It will be\ndifficult to recover your accumulated\nresources and enter the official zone.\nTsk tsk Lyn Sha. What a clever trick. He\ntakes a few pieces of equipment that he\ndoesn't need to show off, but he doesn't\nprovide you with any real help. What\nnonsense are you spouting? Even I can't\nstand it anymore. Tan by Chian also\nlogged on. Who said brother Lin Shia is\nonly good at putting on a show and\nwinning people over? Who says our\nterritory level can't catch up? Tan by\nChiian. Check it yourself. Lord's\nMansion LV2 upgrading. Click to view.\nOnce this 3-day lockdown is over, I'll\nbe almost at level three and I can go to\nthe official server soon. He say me too.\nLord's Mansion LV2 upgrading. Click to\nview. Holy crap. This girl got into a\nsecond tier university so quickly.\nEveryone exclaimed. Even faster than me,\na lord who had a smooth start. Where did\nyou get so many resources? It was given\nto me by brother Lynn Shia. Watch out,\nbeautiful lady. Almost all of your\ntroops have been killed and are unable\nto protect you. Sooner or later, other\nlords will target you. Be careful that\nyou end up losing everything. Your money\nwill be stolen and you'll be captured\nand used as a play thing. Someone warned\nShan by Chin. Thank you, little sister.\nI'll take that as a compliment to my\nbeauty. Centaur Chieft Centaur elite\narcher bear warrior. Click to view. Do\nyou think my unit types are lacking?\nWhere did you get so many different\ntypes of soldiers? It was given to me by\nbrother Lynn Shia. Damn, you guys\nhaven't been doing anything shady, have\nyou? What are you saying? My\nrelationship with brother Lynn Shiao is\ncompletely innocent. Although brother\nLynn Shia can also choose to pursue me,\nhe and Tu Shan by Chin's experiences\nmade everyone envious. See that? That's\nthe advantage of having a powerful\nbacker. The protection money collector\njumped out again. You commoner lords, go\nto sleep. You'll either be dogs or\ncorpses. Tu Shan by Chin said unhappily.\nAlthough most of what I got today was\nthanks to brother Lynn Shia. He also\nsaid that he was only rewarding me\nbecause I risked my life to help him.\nIt's not something you can get by just\nslacking off. Brother Lynn Sha said,\n\"Heaven doesn't help everyone, but\neveryone should help themselves. Even\nwithout brother Lynn Sha, I would only\ndie a glorious death and I would never\nbe treated like a dog and ordered around\nlike a coward. Heaven does not help\neveryone. People must help themselves.\"\nThe beautiful woman's words stirred\nripples in the hearts of the lords. Huh?\nIt's easy for you to talk when you're\nnot the one suffering. You only get to\nsay that because of your looks, the\narrogant voice said. Do you see anyone\nelse getting this kind of treatment?\nBesides, do they even have the right to\nhelp themselves? Silence fell over\neveryone. The flame that had just been\nignited in their hearts was extinguished\nonce more. Then another sigh was heard.\nThat's why we have the Holy Alliance.\nStarting today, the Holy Alliance will\nbreak its rule of only accepting lords\nof rank B and above and will accept any\nlord who is unwilling to be a puppet or\na dog. From this day forward, members of\nthe Holy Alliance will no longer pay\nprotection money to any force. One word,\nunyielding. Do you dare to fight for\nyour own destiny? It was Dinglay. Huh,\nDinglay? What right do you have to talk\nbig? The arrogant young man said,\n\"Didn't you also get your entire unit\nwiped out?\" Dinglay ignored it\ncompletely. These people are just\nbullying you because they think they can\nexploit you by claiming to be from an\nofficial district organization. In\nreality, the official district\norganization wouldn't bother going\nthrough all that trouble for such a\nsmall amount. If you unite, are you\nreally going to be afraid of these\npeople who are just using your\nconnections to bully others? A thought\ninstantly ignited in everyone's minds\nfor breaking through a region and\nannihilating someone just because of\ntheir meager resources. Most of these\nrandom organizations are just using a\nname to extort money. As long as we\nunite, we have nothing to fear. The\narrogant young man was furious. Aren't\nyou afraid of being retaliated against\nafter entering the official area by\ndoing this? Tu Shan by Chien. Entering\nthe battlefield of 10,000 races is for\nfighting and growth. How can you achieve\nanything if you are timid and hesitant?\nEveryone, the pretty girl is right.\nDinglay is right. The momentum was about\nto become uncontrollable. The arrogant\nyoung man said, \"Anyone who dares to\ndisrespect our organization will be\ndealt with immediately.\" The chat\nchannel went silent again. Ding Lay\nsaid, \"Gentlemen, I have also completed\nthree books and will soon follow Brother\nLynn Shiao to the official server. To\nall those who look down on me, here's a\npiece of advice. 30 years east of the\nriver, 30 years west of the river, never\nunderestimate a young man's potential.\"\nEveryone's hearts suddenly lit up again.\nHis blood surged immediately, and even\nhis breathing became rapid. Dingle, well\nsaid. That sounds really exciting.\nAren't we commoner lords lords too?\nLet's fight. Anyone who dares to rob me,\nI'll fight them to the death. That's\nright. Things change every 30 years.\nMany lords in the official districts are\nalso from commoner backgrounds. Who says\nwe can't achieve something great? Isn't\nLin Shia a typical example? He's also a\ncommoner lord. Dinglay felt the powerful\nforce rapidly transmitted from his\ntalent and nodded in satisfaction. The\narrogant young man planned to suppress\nhim. Lynn Shiao doesn't have many days\nleft to live. After the 3-day lockdown,\nhe'll be going to the official district.\nThe people in the heavens won't let him\noff then. Besides, what's the point of\nall this shouting? What does Lyn Xiao's\nawesomeness have to do with you? Do you\nthink Lyn Shia would help you? Don't\nforget, this world is just like this\ndark. There's not a single ray of light.\nAt this moment, Lyn Sha, who had not\nappeared for a long time, finally spoke\nup. Everyone, the battlefield of all\nraces is also going against the heavens.\nHow can we lose our fighting spirit? The\nchat channel fell silent instantly,\neveryone perking up their ears. I won't\nhelp you. I know the battlefield of the\nmyriad races is dark, but I have\nsomething to say to you. May all new\nlords shake off their apathy and simply\nstrive upwards, paying no heed to the\nwords of those who give up on\nthemselves. Even a firefly can shine a\nlittle light in the darkness without\nwaiting for a torch. If there is no\ntorch after this, I will be the only\nlight. If there is no torch thereafter,\nI will be the only light. As everyone\npondered those words, they felt as if\nthey had been struck by lightning. A\nshiver rose from the soles of my feet\nand rushed all the way to the top of my\nhead. Silence. The chat channel for\nnewbies in the Lung Nan region was\nsilent for a full minute with no one\nspeaking. Since that day, in the 10\nnewbie zones of the LN region, the\nnumber of lords extorting money under\nthe guise of official zones has\ndecreased by 90%. Either die or fall\nsilent. The death rate of new lords in\nthe LN region has increased by 50% this\nyear, but the chance of being promoted\nto the official region has also\nincreased by 50%. After a 3-day\nlockdown, Lynn Shiao was officially\npromoted to the next district. Chapter\n137 ascension, once again shocking\neveryone. Finally, the third day of the\nlockdown has arrived. On this day,\ncountless people were still waiting in\nfront of the chat channel, discussing\nenthusiastically. Who else do you think\nbesides Lin Sha could be the first to be\npromoted to a higher level? I'll just\nsay one thing. Dingle is definitely a\ngood candidate. TCH, you don't need to\ntell me. Dingle was already one of the\ntop 10 players in the entire newbie\nzone, and now he's become sworn brothers\nwith Lin Sha. His strength will only\nincrease. During the 3-day lockdown,\naside from the first day when there was\nfighting, many lords who were already\nquite good will probably be able to\nreach tier three by the next few days. I\ndon't think there's anything wrong with\npeople like Chufinga and Joli. It's a\npity that the first player to advance in\nthe newbie zone this year wasn't our Lin\nSha. It's all because of the Black\nFlames lockdown. Yes, Black Flame\ndeserves to die. Amidst the discussions,\nLynn Shiao had made thorough\npreparations and was just waiting for\nthe moment the lockdown ended so he\ncould immediately upgrade his district.\nAlthough the old squad leader, Dugu\nJaalon, had already taken the lead and\nentered the official zone due to the\n3-day lockdown, Lin Shia didn't care, as\nthere were no extra rewards for being\nthe first to advance to the zone.\nMoreover, due to the 3-day lockdown\nperiod, multiple people from the newbie\nzone where Lin Shiao is currently\nlocated will enter the official zone\ntogether, which also provides him with\ncover. Time was approaching 3 minutes, 2\nminutes, 1 minute. We finally arrived.\nThe blockade is lifted and the curtain\nof light in the sky slowly dissipates.\nDing! Player Julie from the 89757\nnewbie zone has entered the official\nzone. Ding! Player Chuunga has entered\nthe official zone 89757.\nThe announcement from the main god\nsystem immediately rang out and the\ngeniuses who had been suppressing their\nemotions for a long time quickly entered\nthe official server at the very first\nmoment of its opening. In a certain area\nof the beginner zone, a flash of light\nappeared and the hazy phantom of a\nlord's mansion rose into the air. Along\nwith the lord's mansion, the phantoms of\nother buildings within the territory\nalso rose into the air. And at the very\nback were various kinds of mineral\nresources. After upgrading to a new\ndistrict, all the buildings and\nresources of the new lord will be\ntransferred to the official district\nwhere they will be placed on their own\nin a location on the vast map of the\nofficial district. Rising into the air\nis the special effect of the upgrade\nzone. Although the god system has\nimplemented some privacy protections,\nmaking the lord's resources and\nbuildings blurry, everyone can still\nroughly understand the lord's personal\nstrength from the blurry phantom. The\nfirst district to be upgraded is Julie.\nThey have a lot of buildings and\nresources. One person remarked, \"No\nwonder he was once the second place\nfinisher. He still has the ability.\"\nHowever, it seems that Chufinga has more\nresources and buildings than Julie.\nNonsense. Chufinga's foundation has\nalways been here. Unlike Julie, he\ndoesn't need to retake the mines. So,\nit's normal that he has developed the\nbest. Look, isn't this Pansyu? He has\nthe most resources. He just has fewer\nbuildings. Uh, they might be a resource\ntype lord. Sh, keep it quiet. We lords\nof the 89757\nnewbie zone have been friends ever since\nLynn Shiao said those words 3 days ago.\nPlease keep it a secret for our friends.\nThere aren't many lords like the young\nboy Pen Shan Yu, but he has a lot of\nresources, so he is likely a resource\ntype lord. He is not strong in combat,\nbut he is good at production. Such lords\nare highly sought after in the official\ndistricts, not only by major\norganizations, but also by many\ndesperate criminals who are tempted to\nrob them. Wong Bo has been promoted to a\nhigher district. Dingle has been\npromoted to a higher district. These\ngeniuses are indeed not to be\nunderestimated. The other lords in the\nnewbie zone, whenever they had free\ntime, would look up to watch the\nspectacular scene of all the geniuses\nadvancing to the newbie zone, hoping\nthat they too would soon be able to\nreach level three and enter the official\nzone. They are all geniuses, but\noverall, Chufinga and Dingle are still\nthe strongest. From the phantom image\nrising into the sky, one can roughly\njudge the lord's strength. The more\nbuildings and mineral resources a lord\npossesses, the stronger he she is.\nSomeone noticed something was wrong.\nWhere's Lin Sha? We haven't heard his\npromotion announcement yet. Everyone\nrealized, \"Oh, right. Where's Lyn Sha?\nCould it be that something happened to\nboss Lyn Sha?\" Silence. Unease. Lyn Sha,\nwhom everyone had been eagerly\nanticipating, had still not ascended to\nimmortality. Could it be that the\nremaining blood lords have come to\nretaliate? Or is it that the experts\nfrom the official zone are exerting\nother pressure? Or is it that boss Lynn\nShiao is afraid to enter the official\nzone for fear of retaliation? As\neveryone was lost in thought, a sudden\nearthquake shook the ground. What\nhappened? There was an earthquake. I\nfelt the tremor here too. Amidst the\nastonishment and uncertainty, someone\nexclaimed, \"Look at the sky.\" Everyone\nlooked up and saw a huge phantom slowly\nrising in the sky. The Phantom was vast\nand boundless, stretching for countless\nkilometers. And when it rose, it covered\nalmost half the sky. Upon closer\ninspection, it turned out to be a\nmountain range. \"Mountain range,\" its\nboss, Lyn shout. Some people realized\nthat Lyno's territory was located in a\ngourd mountain range, and the phantom\nrising in the air was that huge gourd\nmountain range. Not only the mountains,\nbut also the valleys, the buildings on\nthe mountains, and the resources all\ntook off at the same time. My god, Lyn\nSha has emptied an entire mountain\nrange. A hazy but enormous phantom\nslowly rose up. As people gazed at this\nphantom, they could vaguely see the\nentire mountain range, the mineral veins\nand buildings between the ridges, and\nthe hazy territory located at the mouth\nof the mountain range. On the mountain\nrange, there were even some shadowy\nfigures of wild monsters moving around\nand cheering. I think I just saw a witch\ndancing wildly on the mountaintop,\nsomeone said in disbelief. Master\nLynsha, how exactly did you manage to do\nthat? When a lord enters a formal\ndistrict, they can only take away their\nown mineral resources and buildings.\nI've never heard of someone taking away\nan entire mountain range along with\nthem. Lynn Shia is truly amazing. At\nthis moment, watching the giant mountain\nrange slowly recede into the distance.\nThe lords still remaining in the newbie\nzone were filled with envy and longing.\nLynhia&lt;unk&gt;s abilities were infinitely\nelevated in their minds. Within his\nterritory nestled in the mountains, Lyn\nShiao gazed into the distance at the\nrapidly receding beginner area and\nnodded in satisfaction. Within the\nnearly 100 square kilm of the entire\nmountain range, all the mineral veins\nbelong to him. All the monster layers\nbelong to him and even all the monsters\nin the valleys obey him. The Calabash\nmountain range formed a closed loop and\nthe main god system was directly lifted\nup along with the entire mountain.\nEntering the formal area now we don't\neven need to move our nest. We just need\nto find a good place to put this\nmountain. The mountain range stopped\nsuspended tens of thousands of meters\nabove a vast dark expanse of land. Next,\nsimply choose a landing point to\nofficially enter the main area. The\nofficial zone also has a fog of war, so\nchoosing a place to land is very\nimportant. Choosing a location in the\ncrowd makes trading and communication\neasier, but it also makes you more\nlikely to be exposed. The chosen\nlocation was too far from the other\nlords, seemingly safer, but it yielded.\nUse the celestial perspective ability of\nthe Hasha decree. Chapter 138. Finding\nthe location, the aftermath of shock.\nWith the gods perspective activated, Lyn\nSha once again gained an unimaginably\nvast field of vision. The incredibly\nvast map of Long Nan district was\nfinally partially revealed to Lynn\nShiao. He was currently in Lan City, the\ncentral city of the Lan district. Each\nofficial district will have a small\nnumber of city states and a largest city\nwhich is the central city. The lords in\nthe formal districts are scattered in\nvarious places which makes it easier to\nacquire resources and develop their\npower. However, they also have the need\nfor social interaction and\ncommunication. For some important\nresources, face-to-face negotiations are\nalso easier to complete. So, the central\ncity came into being. Lon central city\nhas stood in Lan district for thousands\nof years. This ancient citystate, a\nbattlefield of countless races, covers\nan area comparable to the mega cities\nLin Shiao had seen in his previous life,\nsuch as Beijing, Shanghai, Guangho,\nShenzhen, New York, and Tokyo. It is\nincredibly prosperous and has everything\none could need. There are no Lord's\nterritories in Lan City, only\nresidential and commercial buildings.\nTherefore, many lords chose to place\ntheir territories near Long Nan City for\neasy access to the city. However, due to\nhistorical reasons, the land surrounding\nLan City has long been divided up, and\nonly powerful families and leaders of\nlarge organizations have the opportunity\nto place their territories around Lan\nCity. Within Lon City, except in\ndesignated areas, any act that harms\nothers is prohibited. This is an\nauthority granted to each central city\nby the main god system. Only in this way\ncan a basic peace be maintained in the\nworld of the battlefield of 10,000 races\nwhere the strong become stronger. The\nknowledge he had learned in class echoed\nin his mind and Lin Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s divine\nperspective had already briefly swept\nover the entire Lan city. Lan city after\nentering the official district, you need\nto go there to report. Lynn Shiao\ncontinued to shift his perspective,\nsearching across the vast land. Lynn\nShiao didn't consider locations that\nwere too close to Lan City. However, he\nalso didn't want to settle in any of the\nremote corners of the LN region. Many\nuninhabited areas while possessing\nabundant resources and treasures are\nalso hiding places for lawless elements\nand outlaws like the Celestial People\nOrganization. After a short while, Lin\nSha found a secluded place with abundant\nmineral resources, also located in the\nmountains and hills. After entering the\nofficial area, apart from major battles,\nI mainly rely on teleportation portals\nto get in and out. This is fine in the\nmountainous and hilly areas, and it can\nalso hide my calabash mountain range.\nAfter confirming repeatedly that there\nwas no other person's territory in any\narea within his field of vision around\nthis location, Lin Sha no longer\nhesitated and directly granted his own\nterritory. Ding. You have successfully\nentered the Lia domain, Lan region.\nPlease report to Lan Central City within\n24 hours. As a perk of officially\nbecoming a lord, you have received a\npermanent portal which has been added to\nyour inventory. The notification from\nthe main god system sounded and\nLynhiao's entire territory rapidly\nplummeted in the newbie zone. After\nwitnessing the complete disappearance of\nthe massive mountain range, heated\ndiscussions once again arose. Lynho's\nstrength also left an indelible\nimpression on the new lords of this\nyear's region. His fearless resistance\nagainst power, his counterattack, and\nhis words made countless commoner lords\nidolize Lin Sha, a fast-moving scout\ntype lord who flies at low altitudes.\nSoon, he arrived at the former Hulu\nPass. Looking around, the entire Hulu\nmountain range had disappeared, leaving\nonly a desolate land covering nearly 100\nkm. He picked up a talisman crystal,\nbegan to record the scene before him,\nand then dialed someone's number. Not\nfar away, different lords from different\nfactions also came to this area and\nreported what they had seen and heard.\nDid he really say that\nic? So majestic, Shu Yusi exclaimed in\nadmiration in a magnificent city\nlord&lt;unk&gt;'s mansion. Fongu, you've\nreally made a good friend. Shu Yusi\nsquinted slightly, his hands behind his\nback as he slowly paced back and forth.\nAs an ordinary citizen, he has such\nlofty aspirations and a broad mind. He\nis not only exceptionally capable, but\nhis willpower also seems to be far\nbeyond that of ordinary people. If he\ndoes not die in the future, he will\nsurely achieve great things. Old man,\nyou keep saying what would happen if\nsomeone didn't die, why don't you just\nprotect him? Chufinga with red hair\npicked at his ear and said impatiently,\nI'm tired of hearing how talented Lyn\nShiao is, but I've never seen anyone go\nto protect him. He You're just a child.\nHardship is an essential part of a\ngenius's growth. Didn't you grow up\nquickly after almost being wiped out\nthis time? Chu Yusi said dismissively.\nFongu, why hasn't Lin Sha arrived yet?\nWhat is this real? Did he really say\nthat? The shocked voice, devoid of its\nusual elegance and composure, startled\nthe kneeling brands. Yes, of course it's\ntrue. Everyone in the newbie zone of Lan\nheard what Lin Shao said. I wouldn't\ndare lie. If there are no torches from\nnow on, I will be the only light.\"\nAndrea kept repeating those words to\nherself, and her body swayed\nuncontrollably as she sat on the throne.\nAt this moment, she had lost her usual\ncharm and allure, and instead became\nsomewhat dejected, as if she had\nsuddenly become like a helpless little\ngirl, lost in thought. Who knows the\nhardships I endured leading the demons\nout of the sewers and out into the world\nagain? Does anyone know that we demons\nalso long to see the sunlight? Andrea\nmuttered to herself, her eyes glazed\nover. That's not a very good statement\neither. What Dinglay said about 30 years\neast of the river, 30 years west of the\nriver, I think is even better. Kneeling\nBrands interjected upon seeing his\nmaster's loss of composure. If one day I\nwere to brutally beat that brat Lynn\nShia and then in front of everyone, say\n30 years east of the river, I can't even\nimagine what that would feel like, Bran\nsaid, lost in his beautiful fantasy, his\nbody stiffening with pleasure. Get lost,\nthe succubus princess kicked Bran,\nsending him flying. You're over 700\nyears old. 30 years east of the river,\n30 years west of the river. Don't\nunderestimate the poor in old age.\nBran's voice could be heard from afar.\nThe succubus princess couldn't help but\nlaugh, but her laughter seemed to\ncontain tears. Inside the lord's\nmansion, which resembled a grand gothic\ncathedral, Pu Dawei, a man in a floral\nshirt, crumpled up the note containing\nthe message and casually tossed it\naside. He has some skills, but also the\nnaivity and ridiculousness typical of a\nnovice. Still want to be the only light?\nYou're just like me 20 years ago,\nstealing the spotlight, Lynn Sha.\nHowever, I have found the one I truly\ndeserve to serve, and that is the all-\nknowing and all powerful Lord. I have\nalso received a reward from the Lord, a\nmythical angel. One day, I will correct\nLong Sa's deviations and lead him back\nto the right path.\" The man in the\nfloral shirt raised his hand, and the\nblonde angel behind him quietly stepped\nforward and handed him a cup of warm\ncoffee. Inside the old-fashioned palace,\nthe maid relayed the information she had\ngathered to the aloof and elegant\nbeauty. The woman's eyes narrowed\nslightly at first, then suddenly\nwidened. \"Did he really say that?\" And\nafter that, there were no torches, and I\nbecame the only light. \"Yes.\" Upon\nhearing this, the lords of the 89757\nnewbie zone immediately killed the lord\nwho had been collecting protection\nmoney, the maid replied. Then many major\nbattles broke out in the newbie zone,\nand many lords who were previously\nstrangers gathered together to resist\nthe extortionists in the official zone.\nGood. Good. Well done. The stunningly\nbeautiful woman's perpetually aloof face\nshowed a rare expression of joy,\nsurprising even the maid standing beside\nher. Lyn Sha is stronger than I\nimagined. We must protect him. We must\ndo everything in our power to protect\nhim. Even if the whole world is against\nus, judging by the time, he should have\nbeen officially promoted to the district\nlevel today. I need to go find Chu Yusi\nright away and explain things to him.\nChapter 139. Reporting in. Farewell to\nDugu. Jaolon. Lyn Sha completed the\nlanding in the official zone. He briefly\ninspected the territory, finding all the\nbuildings intact, and then strolled\nleisurely with Baoi, patrolling a small\npart of the Calabash Valley. All the\nmonsters were safe and sound. The flying\nexperience was still a bit too exciting\nfor them. A ruthless demon fainted with\njoy when he heard that Sherry, that\nwitch, was finally able to escape the\nnewbie zone. Why is she so happy to\nescape the beginner area? because she\nsaid there was a very powerful lord in\nthe newbie zone who was her master and\nthat master controlled her so she\ncouldn't absorb the essence of male\ncreatures. Now that she's in the\nofficial zone, there are wild monsters\nand wild men everywhere. Lyn Sha was a\nlittle embarrassed. Then ask her next\ntime who her owner is in the official\narea. Oh. The demon answered blankly and\nwent back to work diligently in his\nsulfur mind. After confirming that his\nterritory was intact, Lynn Shiao calmly\narrived at the gate of his territory and\nopened a teleportation portal right\nbelow the four exploding arrow towers.\nLocation next to the Lord's reception\narea in Lan City. Specific coordinates\nxxx.\nThe permanent portal will open soon.\nFrom now on, Lyno's territory and the\ncentral city can be reached simply by\ncrossing the portal. When he wants to go\nback, he only needs to silently think of\nopening a portal to return to the gate\nof his territory. Ba, use the\nconcealment skill to conceal the portal\nin my territory. I don't want my\nlocation to be discovered when I come\nback. Ba's mythical hero quality is\nunlocked. She gains an additional skill,\npeerless demoness. Peerless enchantress.\nBa, one of the four enchantresses,\npossesses boundless charm. This skill is\nunlocked if she has become another man's\nwife. Ba can temporarily seize the luck\nof others and transfer it to a certain\nperson or place and it will be returned\nafter the time is up. Ba can influence\nfortune so she can amplify, shrink and\ntransfer the effects of specific skills.\nSkills that are too powerful cannot be\nmanipulated. Lynn Shiao had Bao Se\ndirectly transfer and amplified the\nconcealment effect of the forest which\ncloak making the portals within his\nterritory concealed blocking any\nexploration by a rank or lower skills\nmaking them undetectable unlocatable and\nuncarchable by specific skills. This\ngreatly enhances the security of one's\nown territory. It's time to report for\nduty. Lyn Sha had already contacted\nDinglay. He stepped through the\nteleportation portal and arrived\ndirectly in a corner of the LN city\nreception area where he met Ding Lay\nstanding not far away. Lin Sha nodded to\nDing Lay and together they walked\ntowards the towering main building in\nthe city center where the city lord's\nmansion was located. Brother Shia,\nalthough we've been locked down for 3\ndays, there are still very few new lords\ncoming here. Ding Lay said while\nobserving the surrounding situation.\nEven if we're not the earliest, we're\nstill in the top 50. That's fine, too.\nI'm actually a very low-key person, Lyn\nShao said with a faint smile. Ding Li\npursed his lips speechlessly. When you\nsaid that when there was no torch, I was\nthe only light. The amplification effect\nof my 30 years of prosperity statement\nwas directly reduced by 30%. So, you\nstill have 70% of your growth left. This\ntime your strength must have surpassed\nany of your previous boasting, right?\nIt's a glorious performance. Don't put\nit so harshly. Okay. Okay. That's what\nwe call a glorious performance. The\nreception area was not far from the city\nlord's mansion. And soon Lin Shia and\nDinglay walked downstairs to the city\nlord's mansion. Before the magnificent\nhall, more than a dozen lords who had\narrived that day were already waiting.\nOnce it was clear that almost everyone\nhad arrived, the gatekeeper let the new\nlords in to register. I remember that in\nprevious years this matter was handled\nin the side hall of the city lord's\nmansion. A lord said, \"What's going on\nthis year? They actually let us into the\nhall. Are we going to see the city\nlord?\" That's right. A new city lord was\nappointed just a few days ago. The new\nrule he established is that all lords\nmust report to the city lord's mansion\nso that he can meet with each of them.\nOh, they're really letting us see the\ncity lord. That's a very important\nperson. As the group chatted in hush\ntones, they suddenly noticed Lin Sha\napproaching. Lyn Sha had made a name for\nhimself in the battle a few days ago,\nand coupled with his extremely handsome\nappearance, he was quickly recognized.\nYour Lin Sha? Lyn Sha nodded in\nacknowledgement. Those present were the\nmost outstanding and top-notch geniuses\nfrom each of the newbie zones. They also\nhad their own pride. When they\ndiscovered that Lin Shiao was with them,\nthey simply greeted him or nodded in\nacknowledgement. However, most people\ncouldn't hide their envy and jealousy of\nLin Xiao's outstanding performance. Lyn\nShao saw everything but continued\nwalking forward without caring. In the\ngrand hall, a majestic figure stood in\nthe center, surrounded by dozens of\nofficials of various ranks. On the side\nof the hall, behind the officials were\nseveral other newly promoted novice\nlords resting. Chu Yusi Lin Shao\nrecognized the figure standing in the\ncenter. The lord of Lan city, the\ncentral city of Long Nan district is\nactually the lord of Jangdong city in\nthe real world of blue star. Harah,\nwelcome. Welcome to all you talented\nyoung people. Chu Yusi laughed heartily,\nopened his arms in a welcoming gesture,\nand had everyone invited to the center\nof the hall to stand in front of him.\nGreetings, Lord City Lord. No need for\nformalities. This is a city state on the\nbattlefield of all races. There aren't\nas many formalities as in the real world\nof Blue Star. Chu Yui said, \"I have only\nbeen the city lord of Lan City for a few\ndays, and I am a newcomer just like you.\nWe're all newcomers. Let me introduce\nmyself. I am Chu Yusi. I was once one of\nthe chief lords of the Lan district.\nAfter retiring, I became the city lord\nof Dangdong city in the blue star world.\nThe domain lord of Langia transferred me\nto Lan city to assume the position of\ncity lord. Fellow young talents, the\nfuture prosperity of the Lan region\ndepends on you all. After saying this,\nChu Yusi bowed slightly to the crowd.\nNo, no, you flatter me, city lord.\nEveryone hurriedly returned the greeting\nand then in the order they entered, each\nbriefly introduced themselves. Lyn Sha\nwas at the back of the line and at that\nmoment he casually looked around.\nSuddenly he felt a familiar gaze gently\nfall upon him through the crowd of\nofficials. Lyn Sha turned his head and\nsaw a woman in purple standing not far\naway, nodding to him from afar. She wore\na pale purple robe, a sword at her\nwaist, and stood tall and proud,\nethereal and otherworldly like a fairy\ndescended to earth. Her long hair\ncascaded down. Her purple robe was as\nbeautiful as a flower, and her long\nsword was as white as snow. She\nglistening, and her every move exuded a\ncool elegance. It was Dugu Jaon.\nLinhao&lt;unk&gt;s lips curled up slightly,\nand he nodded to Dugu Xiaolan from afar.\nBy this time, Dinglay had finished his\nintroduction. The powerful strength he\nunconsciously exuded drew exclamations\nof admiration from the lords, while the\nofficials standing nearby whispered\namong themselves and nodded in\nagreement. Dinglay turned around and\ngave his seat to Lyn Shao. The\natmosphere suddenly became quiet. All\neyes turned to Lyn Sha. Everyone\nrecognized Lin Sha. Lyn Shiao, you\nshameless lord, how dare you even report\nto the official district. Chapter 140\nsurrounded and attacked head-on. A\nfurious curse broke the silence that had\nfollowed Lin Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s arrival. Lyn\nShiao, you scum who colludes with\nforeign tribes. How dare you come to\nreport to the official district? Lyn\nShao was slightly takenback. He looked\nup and saw that Chu Yusi's face was also\nfilled with shock and confusion, which\nquickly turned into undisguised anger.\nThe speaker was an official underchui.\nHe spoke with spittlefing, pointing at\nLin Shiao and condescendingly\ncriticizing him. H an orphan from\nJangdong Tomato orphanage. Being able to\nenter the battlefield of the myriad\nraces is already a blessing from God.\nYet he's unwilling to give up his once\ndominant position at school and colludes\nwith foreign races. Another official\ncame out and sneered. It's\nunderstandable for young people to show\noff. Which of us here wasn't a prodigy\nin our youth? The important thing is to\nuphold the bottom line. Otherwise, we\nare traitors who betray Lia and\nhumanity. Young man, don't be too\nbloodthirsty. You kill the descendants\nof the chief lord at the slightest\ndisagreement, even in front of others.\nWith your temperament, it's hard to go\nfar. One official after another came\nout, mocking and ridiculing Lyn Shao.\nLyno&lt;unk&gt;s expression quickly turned\ncold. All the novice lords around him,\nexcept for Ding Lay, took a step away to\nkeep their distance from Lyn Shao.\nAcross from him, Shu Yusi's face was\nalso terribly gloomy. Suddenly, as if by\nprior agreement, all the officials\nsimultaneously attacked Lin Shiao\nwithout consulting him. This was not\nonly a warning to Lyn Shia, but also a\nreprimand to him, the city lord, who had\nonly been in office for a few days. Shut\nup. Chu Yusi interrupted the officials\naccusations with a sharp shout. I, the\ncity lord, am here to welcome all the\nnew lords who have come to report to the\nofficial district, not to have you\ncriticize them. Lyn Shia has neither\nkilled any innocent people nor done\nanything to betray Lia. So what are you\nall babbling about here for? What kind\nof behavior is this making such a\nracket? Lyn Sha raised his eyelids and\nglanced at Chu Yui. This man was Fong\nJi's father. In his youth, he was a mad\nman from Jangdong. He didn't care about\nofficial decorum or his own authority.\nHe directly bered his subordinates,\nwhich intimidated some of those who\nmocked him. The sudden argument in the\nhall attracted the attention of those\nwho had already registered and were\nresting on one side of the hall. They\ngathered around, puzzled. A cold,\nbeautiful woman in purple also looked\nover from afar. Your excellency, you are\nunaware of this. An official relying on\nhis seniority retorted. We did not\nintend to make things difficult for Len\nShiao. It's just that this boy is unruly\nand has a deep misunderstanding of\nLshia. We had no choice but to speak up\nto remind him in order to prevent him\nfrom going astray. What misunderstanding\ndoes he have about Lia? Chu Yusi asked\nin a deep voice. Lord, City Lord, an\nofficial stepped forward and added. I'm\nsure the city lord is aware of this\nboy's spectacular battle a few days ago\nand his words, \"Since there are no more\ntorches, I will be the only light.\" The\nofficial turned around and looked at Lyn\nSha. This brat actually said that my\ndragon kingdom has no torches. He said,\n\"The battlefield of the war of 10,000\nraces is dark and that the dragon\nkingdom is dark. Isn't this cursing long\nsya, belittling long sa and maliciously\nsmearing Longa? The officials eyes were\nbloodshot as he glared at Lin Sha as if\nhe were not a young lord but a heinous\nvillain. That is smearing Lia and\nspreading malicious rumors. Where is\nLia? Anything dark? Based on that one\nsentence alone, we could convict you.\nThe scene was chaotic. Some officials\nnodded coldly and looked down at Lyn Sha\nwhile others stood indifferently at the\nback with their hands behind their\nbacks, seemingly unconcerned. On the\noutermost edge, the novice lords who\nwere watching suddenly realized what was\ngoing on and began to whisper among\nthemselves. Lyn Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s expression\nwas calm and indifferent, showing\nneither joy nor sorrow. It seemed that\nthese scenes were nothing more than\nnoise to him, not worth a groan. Shu\nYusi, who was about to continue\nreprimanding the disobedient\nsubordinate, saw Lin Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s\nexpression and demeanor and secretly\nnodded in approval, raising his opinion\nof Lin Shiao even higher. Ding Lay\ncouldn't hold back any longer and was\nabout to speak up for Lyn Sha, but Lyn\nSha stopped him with a gesture. Lyn Sha\nslowly took a step forward. With just\nthat one step, the entire hall\nimmediately fell silent. Even the\nofficials who were spitting as they\nspoke were startled and subconsciously\nstopped talking. Lyn Shiao, what other\nwords do you have to defend yourself?\nThe official was somewhat embarrassed\nand annoyed to find himself intimidated\nby a novice lord. Everyone, I Lyn Sha am\njust here to report. Once I finished, I\ncould have left. But you officers have a\ndeep misunderstanding of me. Lyn Sha Lyn\nSha said calmly. What I said about the\ntorch and the light was only to\nencourage everyone in the newbie zone to\nshake off the coldness and do more to\ncheer themselves up. This is just to\nensure that the lords in the newbie zone\ndon't lose their edge and that they\ndon't allow those who are just sitting\non the laps of power to ride rashad over\nthem. I didn't say who is darkness.\nDarkness is there and we will have to\nface it eventually. Lyn Sha sneered. But\nnow some people are taking it personally\nand getting anxious. Is there a single\nwrong word in what Lin Sha said? Who are\nyou calling a fox borrowing the tiger's\npower? A mere figurehead holding a\nposition. What are you eating? Although\nthe official had been detached from\nChinese civilization for a long time, he\nstill subconsciously understood about\n80% of the meaning. When he heard Lin\nShia use an idiom, he clearly understood\nthat Lyn Shao was cursing him. Shu Yusi\nnarrowed his eyes in satisfaction upon\nhearing Lin Shiao use two four character\nphrases in succession which were\nconcise, meaningful, and profound,\nwaiting for Lin Xiao's next response.\nI'm not targeting anyone in particular.\nI'm saying that all of you here who are\ncriticizing me are just bullies holding\npositions without doing any work. You\nofficials, aren't you just relying on\nthe power given to you by the Dragon Sea\nKingdom to point fingers at the lords\nwho are conquering all sides, and you're\nalways trying to punish me? Isn't this\njust a fox borrowing the tiger's power?\nYou officials, instead of investigating\nthe facts and understanding the cause\nand course of events, you slap the\naccusations of indiscriminate killing\nand smearing Lia on my head. What is\nthis if not holding a position without\ndoing your job? Lord Shu, I have a\nsuggestion for you. Most of these\nofficials, big and small, are not\ncapable of being used. Lyn Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s\nvoice wasn't loud. But after he finished\nspeaking, the entire room fell silent.\nThe official who was being scolded\nangrily pointed his finger at Lin Shiao,\ntrembling and unable to speak. You, what\na sophistry. Do our officials need you\nto give them orders? Some officials were\nso angry they laughed. All right. All\nright. Even if what torch fire and the\ndark stream meant was what you said to\nencourage everyone in the newbie zone.\nBut what about your collusion with the\ndemons? The demon race is the common\nenemy of the entire blue star. The blue\nstar convention clearly states, \"Anyone\nwho colludes with the demon race is\nguilty of a serious crime.\" Lyn Sha, how\ndo you explain this? Lyn Sha casually\npicked at his ear and said\nindifferently, \"I don't know I'm\ncolluding with the demons. Do you have\nany evidence?\" Chapter 141. The Dragon\nSia domain Lord appears. Still trying to\ndeny it, the official shouted. I'll shut\nyou up right now. He pulled out a list\nand announced loudly. Your vassel lord\ninadvertently started a live stream and\nstumbled upon an abyssal demon\ndiscussing your relationship with the\ndemon princess. I suspect you and the\ndemon princess have some shady deal\ngoing on. Lyn Sha said expressionlessly.\nYou believe what the demons say? You\nbelieve what the enemy says? If that\nabyss demon said you were his son, you\nwould have gained a father for no\nreason. The official was so angry he\nchoked. You suppressed laugh came from\nbehind me. How will you explain when the\nwitches in your territory reiterate your\nintention to marry the demon princess\nduring the final battle? The witch said\nthose words to put some pressure on the\nbloodthirsty lords who might still be\ninvading. This is just a tactical\ndeception and doesn't count. Remembering\nhow Sherry thought she could become a\nlord after ascending to the official\nzone and danced wildly with joy, Lyn Sha\nsuddenly felt a headache coming on. He\nthought he might have to go back and\nteach this woman. No, this witch, whose\nmind was filled with unhealthy thoughts\na lesson. Several lords among the\nonlookers nodded slightly, agreeing with\nLin Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s explanation. All fair in\nwar. There&lt;unk&gt;'s no such thing as\nhonesty on the battlefield. Then let me\nask you, why are there so many demons\nunder your command in your valley?\nLynsha said, I need to correct one\npoint. These demons, like all the wild\nmonsters in the valley, are only loyal\nto me, but they are not troops under my\ncommand. The official shouted, \"How did\nyou do that? This is the secret of my\ntalent, and I cannot tell you. Nonsense.\nHumans don't have that kind of talent,\nand humans can't be friends with wild\nmonsters.\" Lynn Sha sneered. Yes, peace\ncan reduce the monster's hostility,\ncan't it? The official asked in\nconfusion. You use this F-rank talent to\nsubdue wild monsters. Lyn Sha said\nseriously. Of course not. It's mainly\nbecause I'm handsome. A few scattered\nlaughs came from behind him. The\nofficial realized that he had been\ntricked by Lin Sha and his face\nimmediately turned red. What a\ndespicable liar who spouts nonsense.\nWell, you can't deny it now, can you?\nAnother official waved his hand, and a\ngiant projection appeared in midair.\nThis was the scene of the great battle\nbetween Lin Shiao and Black Flame. At\nthat time, Black Flame had already\nperished, leaving only the last\nremaining Iron Wall crusaders. In the\nscene, Lyn Xiao's white-clad hero pulled\na miniature nest demon from his robes\nand threw it into the enemy ranks. The\nbattle was intense. The footage was\nclear and it's unclear when the live\nstream was recorded. Lyn Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s\nwhiteclad hero who keeps a nest demon is\nonce again on display in full view of\neveryone. Please tell me what's going on\nwith this nest demon. After showing the\nfootage, the official looked coldly at\nLyn Sha, waiting for his explanation.\nLyn Sha shrugged. Even primitive humans\ncould raise lions and tigers and tame\nwolves as dogs. My hero wants to try\ntaming a little nest demon as a battle\npet. Is there anything wrong with that?\nHow can demons be tamed? Just raise him\nlike a son. Another low chuckle came\nfrom behind. The officials face flushed\nred. But those are demons, the common\nenemy of the entire blue star. Lynn Shia\ncurled his lip. Why don't you just kill\nall the demons on the battlefield of all\nraces in the blue star realm? liberate\nall the mineral resources occupied by\nthe demons and benefit the lords.\nWouldn't that be better? The official\nwas speechless. Indeed, although the\ndemons were enemies on the battlefield\nof all races, which wild monster wasn't\nan enemy in every district, countless\ndemons occupy various resource points.\nBut the lords of dragon summer have\nalways treated them as ordinary wild\nmonsters. Seeing the official\nspeechless, Lynn Sha added, \"My hero\nraised the nest demons to understand the\nhabits of the demon race and to become\nfamiliar with them so that he could\nbetter criticize and fight against the\ndemon race in the future. He is so\nnoble, much better than you, bunch of\npeople who only know how to talk. you.\nSeeing that Lynn Shao had calmly\ndiffused all the accusations and that\nnone of the officials who had accused\nhim had any concrete evidence,\nfrustration and anger gradually crept\ninto their hearts. They felt that Lyn\nSha was connected to the demon race, but\nthey were powerless to do anything about\nhim. Chu Yusi nodded in satisfaction\nonce again. Lynn Shiao had taught this\ngroup of incompetent and tyrannical\nofficials a lesson without him even\nhaving to lift a finger. Lord City Lord.\nThe official went directly to Chui. This\nboy is arrogant and conceited, publicly\ndefying the officials of the city lord's\nmansion. He has absolutely no respect\nfor the law or authority, and he also\nhas an unclear and ambiguous\nrelationship with the demons. I suggest\nwe thoroughly investigate this person.\nUntil then, I do not recommend letting\nhim act recklessly. Oh, Chu Yusi said,\n\"Without evidence, what crime can he be\ncharged with?\" \"Sir, the laws of Lshia\nonly require suspicion to investigate\nhim. As long as we investigate, we will\ndefinitely find evidence.\" \"Absurd. How\ncan you shoot the arrow first and then\ndraw the target?\" Chu Yusi rebuked, \"Lin\nXiao is one of the top geniuses in our\nLnon region. Wouldn't doing this\ndisappoint the people of the world. My\nlord, I was only thinking of Long Xia's\nbest interests, the official said\nsincerely. Lyn Sha only has F- level\nlord talent and is a commoner. No matter\nhow you explain it, it is impossible for\nhim to defeat the black flame army\ninnocently. The ambiguous relationship\nbetween Lin Shia and the demon clan is\nescalating and has become widely known.\nIf we don't make some statements, soon\nother domains will doubt us, question\nus, and even find excuses to make things\ndifficult for us. Don't forget, Lynn\nShiao just killed a squad of legendary\ngold tier Templar knights. Right now,\nthere are quite a few people who are\nwatching us closely, ready to cause\ntrouble if we don't deal with Lin Shiao.\nChu Yusi narrowed his eyes. The official\nwas right. This was also one of the\nfocal points of his argument with the\nconservative officials in the Lang Sha\ndomain palace that day. Dugu Nanuang\ntransferred him to Lan city as the city\nlord also so that he could solve this\nproblem himself. Lynn Shiao had ties\nwith the demon clan, but he wanted to\nprotect this young man who he found\nagreeable. The atmosphere in the hall\nbecame deathly silent. Everyone looked\nat the new city lord and then at Lin\nShia who stood tall and composed. Ding\nlay clenched his fists, gritted his\nteeth, and slowly scanned his\nsurroundings. In the distance, a\nbeautiful figure in purple was also\nsilently watching. Lyn Sha sighed\ninwardly, realizing he had\nunderestimated the influence of the\ndemon clan and the pressure exerted on\nLia by other domains. Forget it. If I'm\nreally going to be investigated, I'll\njust open a portal and escape, then live\nas a fugitive in the vast region and\nsecretly develop my power. Chu Yusi\nfinally let out a cold snort and was\nabout to speak when a giant projection\nsuddenly appeared in the center of the\nhall. A woman of unparalleled beauty,\nmature and aloof, dressed in a\nmagnificent gown and adorned with solemn\nheaddress, appeared before the crowd,\nexuding a cool and noble air, yet\npossessing an air of authority. Lord,\nterritory Lord. The officials were\ntakenback for a moment, then quickly\nbowed their heads respectfully. Oh my,\nit's her majesty the queen. The novice\nlords then realized what was happening\nand hurriedly followed the officials in\nbowing. The person who came was none\nother than Dugan Nanwang, the current\ndomain lord of Langsha domain, the\npatriarch of one of the four major\nfamilies of Langsha kingdom and known as\nthe queen of Lshia among the people of\nLangsha. In the present-day Lang Sha\nkingdom and Langsha domain, there is no\nlonger a monarch. The title of queen is\nmerely a common name among the people.\nDugu Nanuang glanced around with\nindifferent eyes, then spoke softly.\n\"Chui, your subordinate is here.\nHaven't&lt;unk&gt; you finished the task I\nassigned you?\" Shu Yui lowered his head,\nhis mind a complete blank, his eyes\ndarting around. I'm already taking care\nof it. Is it being processed? If it were\nbeing processed, this place wouldn't be\nin such a mess. Dug Nanuang said, \"Lin\nXiao is my disciple, someone I have been\ncultivating with great effort recently.\"\nHowever, people have been slandering\nhim, saying that he is colluding with\nthe demon race. Didn't I tell you to\nclarify the rumors? Chapter 142. The\ndomain lord's closed door disciple.\nKenzo Dohara visits. Dugu Nanuang, the\ndomain lord of Langsha domain and\nsomeone she has been cultivating.\nEveryone present stood frozen in place\nas if they were sitting on wooden\nchickens. If that's the case, then it\nexplains why Lynn Shiao has such great\nstrength, powerful heroes, powerful\ntroops, and so many resources. She was\nthe most powerful woman in the entire\nDragon Summer domain. How could the\npower cultivated by the domain lord of\nDragon domain not be strong? Even if\nit's an F-level talent, we'll build it\nup for you. Although Chu Yusi looked\ndown and seemed confused, his eyes\ndarted around. After hearing Dugu\nNanchuan's words, he immediately figured\nout the reason. The rumors about Lin\nShiao and the demon clan are getting\nworse and worse. The domain lord is\ngoing to take action personally to give\nLynn Shia a legitimate lineage. The\ndomain lord must protect Lin Sha. The\ndomain lord doesn't care about Lin Sha\nas ties to the demon clan. He must\nprotect Lin Sha. Chu Yusi was overjoyed\nand quickly said, \"This subordinate\ndares not forget the Lord&lt;unk&gt;'s\ninstructions. I just wanted to test Lin\nXiao&lt;unk&gt;s character when faced with\nmalicious difficulties.\" \"So, have you\npassed the test?\" Dugan Nonwang asked\ncoldly. With unwavering resolve and\nexceptional willpower, he is destined to\nbecome an outstanding chief lord of the\nDragon Sia domain in the future. As soon\nas Chu Yusi finished speaking, the scene\nerupted in uproar. In front of the\ndomain lord, the city lord praised a\nlord who had just entered the official\narea, saying that he would definitely\nbecome the chief lord in the future.\nThere are only 10 chief lords currently\nin service in the entire dragon sia\ndomain who are the strongest fighting\nforce in the entire dragon sa domain. on\nthe surface. In a moment, your\nsubordinates will issue an internal and\nexternal announcement proclaiming to the\nentire Dragon Sia domain and replying to\nforeign nations that Lin Sha has no\nconnection with the demon clan, but is\nthe most trustworthy, direct descendant\ngenius of the Dragon Sia domain. Very\ngood. The woman projected on the giant\nscreen nodded calmly. Chu Yusi, you\nshould properly manage your\nsubordinates. What's the use of keeping\nofficials who are incompetent and lack\ndrive? If you're going to replace them,\nthen replace them directly regardless of\nwhose faction they belong to. All the\nofficials shrank back in unison. Lyn\nShia, you're absolutely right. It has to\nbe admitted that there are still many\ndark sides to Lia and many things that\naren't exactly honorable. Gentlemen,\nregardless of whether Linhao's words\nwere meant to encourage novice lords to\nbreak free from their aloofness and\nshine on their own, or to point out the\nmany dark sides of Lia, his words\ndirectly address the shortcomings and\npoint out the deficiencies. Any official\nshould take this as a warning and not\ntry to make things difficult for Lin\nSha. If this happens again, I will never\nlet you off the hook.\" As Dugu Nanuang\nfinished speaking, her cold gaze swept\naround the hall once more. Finally\nsettling on Lin Sha, Lyn Sha nodded\nslightly, meeting Dugun Nanuang&lt;unk&gt;s\ngaze with composure. He looked like an\narrogant genius, responding to his\nsuperior, neither serval nor humble,\ndisplaying extraordinary demeanor. Dugu\nNanuang&lt;unk&gt;s gaze then swept lightly\nover the figure in purple before she\nclosed the communication. Few, everyone\npresent breathed a sigh of relief,\nfinally freed from the oppressive aura\nof Queen Dugu. Looking at themselves,\nthey were already covered in cold sweat.\nThat was Dugu Nanuang, the number one\nperson in Lang Sha domain. I never\nexpected her to be so beautiful and\nyoung. And Lord Lia, why did you\nsuddenly come to help me? On the\nsurface, Lin Sha maintained a calm and\ncomposed demeanor, ignoring the\nsurprised and envious gazes cast upon\nhim. But inwardly, his emotions were in\nturmoil. Such an important figure who\nhad never said a word to me suddenly\nappeared and took all the blame for the\nsuspicions surrounding me. Could there\nbe a trap here? I have already refused\nthe official offer from Chu Yusi. So why\nwould the domain lord personally come to\nhelp me clear my name? With his\nremarkable observational skills, Lyn Sha\ncouldn't help but turn his head slightly\nto look at the figure in purple in the\ndistance. Could it be that the class\nmonitor intervened again? But what does\nshe know? We can't just guess. Both of\nthem share the surname Dugu. And\nalthough Lord Dugga's makeup is a bit\nheavy, the two still look somewhat\nsimilar. The two also have very similar\ntemperaments. Both being aloof and\nreserved. One is more mature with a\ndignified and elegant air and an\nunparalleled beauty. The other is more\ngraceful, lively, and cunning. Payment\nto death. I wouldn't believe that the\nclass monitor and the lord of Lsha\ndomain had no connection. Dugu Jaolon\ncalmly met Lynh Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s gaze and\nsimply nodded slightly. Linhao&lt;unk&gt;s\nheart skipped a beat. There was indeed a\nconnection. For the sake of the class\nmonitor, I'll take on the role of Dugan\nNanuang&lt;unk&gt;s disciple for a while. I'll\nask the class monitor for the specific\nreason later. Whispers filled the hall.\nSeveral officials glanced at Lin Shiao\nwith complicated expressions before\nwhispering amongst themselves. Everyone\nhad recovered from their shock and began\ndiscussing the words spoken by Lord Lia.\nHey, so Lin Shiao is actually a disciple\npersonally trained by the domain lord. I\nthink those people outside who doubt Lyn\nXiao strength can shut up now. There's\nno need to doubt the strength of the\ndomain lord's lineage. No wonder he\nrebuked these officials to their faces\nwithout any fear. He has the demeanor of\na domain lord. It seems we misunderstood\nLin Sha. Ding Lay also relaxed, looking\nat Lynn Shiao with shock in his eyes.\nLynn Sha didn't need to ask to know what\nhe was thinking in that mournful look.\nIt must be because he had acted too\nwell. Could he get one for him too? But\nthere was nothing he could do. Her\nmajesty the queen suddenly attacked him\nbefore he could react. I can't very well\ngo to her majesty the queen and beg her\nfor another disciple spot. Everyone,\nplease quiet down. Chu Yusi finally\nspoke. I originally just wanted to test\nLynn Shiao and see how everyone would\nreact to this matter. Now that the\ndomain lord has spoken and cleared Lin\nSha of suspicion, there's no need for me\nto say anything more. You are all\ngeniuses from Lan District and even Lia\nfull of vigor. I hope that in the future\nyou can also be like Lynn Shiao. Break\nfree from your aloofness, shine your own\nlight and become the light in the\ndarkness. the domain Lord and I will\nalways support you. We will heed your\nteachings Lord City Lord. All the lords\nwho came to report bowed in unison. The\nregistration process is complete and\nthey can now return to their respective\nterritories. Just then a commotion arose\noutside the hall. Then with a loud bang,\na security guard was shoved to the\nground and the group swaggered in. Lord\nCity Lord. A loud yet strange voice rang\nout, causing everyone to turn their\nheads and watch as this arrogant group\nwalked straight up to them. The group of\npeople wore loose black clothing, wooden\nclogs, and their hair was tied in small\nbraids and combed back, revealing large\nexpanses of smooth foreheads. Below\ntheir noses, in the center of their\nfiltrum, was a small tuft of black\nbeard. The leader, a fat man with a\nsleazy appearance, shouted\nexaggeratedly, \"Lord City Lord, we\nfinally found you. You must stand up for\nus.\" Chu Yusi suppressed his anger and\nslowly said, \"Kinzo Dohara, didn't I\ntell you to stay at the consulate, and I\nwould summon you after I finish my work?\nWhy are you forcibly breaking into my\ncity lord&lt;unk&gt;'s mansion?\" Lord Chu, you\nare wise to see the truth. Kenzo Dohra\nbowed deeply to Chu Yusi in a seemingly\nrespectable manner, then slowly stood\nup, his gaze coldly fixed on Lin Sha. We\nheard that Lyn Sha was here, so we\nrushed over. I'd like to ask Lord Chu to\ncompensate my Eastern Kingdom for its\nlosses. And while I'm at it, I'll also\nkill that scoundrel Lyn Sha. Chapter\n143, Demanding Compensation. Greater\nEast Asia co-rossperity sphere. The\natmosphere in the hall erupted in\nuproar. Even those who were just about\nto leave all stayed behind. Everyone\nlooked at Lin Shiao and the visiting\ngroup from Japan. Chu Yusi snorted\ncoldly. What arrogance. Kenzo Dohara.\nYou come to my city lord's mansion and\nexpect me to kill my own lord and\ncompensate you for the losses. What\ngrounds do you have for demanding that I\nkill Lyn Shao? And what grounds do you\nhave for demanding compensation from us\nfor any losses? If you can't explain it\nand you come here to cause trouble,\nyou'll regret it. Chu Yusi&lt;unk&gt;s eyes\nflashed with a sharp light as he stared\nintently at two Fuan not long after he\ntook office. First, an official made\nthings difficult for Lin Sha and then an\nenvoy from Japan barged into the hall\nand made unreasonable demands, making\nthis arrogant man from Jang Dongl&lt;unk&gt;s\nface. Kenzo Dohura had not expected Chu\nYusi to be so furious and he calmed down\nslightly saying of course we have ample\nreason. We have suffered serious losses\nbecause of Lin Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s actions and we\nalso know that Lin Shiao is colluding\nwith the demons. Both of these reasons\npoint to Lin Shiao the man standing\nbefore you. Therefore, we demand that\ncity lord Chu severely punish Lin Shao.\nH colluding with the demons. Tell me\nthen. Kenzo Dohara immediately recounted\nthe entire story of Lin Xiao's collusion\nwith the demons, but the content was\nexactly the same as what the many\nofficials had just said. Lyn Shiao\npicked at his ears out of boredom.\nNothing had changed. Not a single word\nwas different. He was so tired of\nhearing it. Huh, ridiculous to slander\nmy lord without any substantial\nevidence. Lyn Shia is the disciple of\nthe lord of my dragon domain. How dare\nyou slander him? Considering you are\nambassadors of Japan, I will not pursue\nthis matter this time. However, if it\nhappens again, you will be expelled. Chu\nYusi didn't waste any words and\nsuppressing his anger, repeated Dugu\nNanuang&lt;unk&gt;s words. Kenzo Dohara&lt;unk&gt;'s\nexpression changed slightly. He rolled\nhis eyes, wiped his sweat, and smiled.\nAh, I see. It was a misunderstanding.\nHowever, our Japan is only acting in\ngood faith, isn't it? After all, the\nblue star convention states that\neveryone has a responsibility to resist\nthe demon race. Kenzo Dohura glanced at\nLin Shia indifferently. In that case, we\nonly need Lord Chu to compensate us for\nour losses. As for how to deal with Lin\nSha, we will leave it to you, Chu. You\nsee, oh, what's the story behind your\nlosses? And why do you want us to\ncompensate you? Lord of the City, I\nKinszo Dohara, representing the Shikoku\nIsland Ambassador of the Japanese\nEmpire, hereby formally negotiate with\nyou. Our Shikoku Island recently\ncooperated with the Western European\nregion, investing a large amount of\nresources in the Grandmaster of the\nKnights Templar. We are willing to\nsponsor the growth and expansion of the\nKnights Templar and represent the Blue\nStar Realm in battles against other nine\nHeaven Star realms. A portion of the\nKnights Templar&lt;unk&gt;s profits will go to\nour Eastern Kingdom. But unexpectedly,\nin just a few months, the Knights\nTemplar still haven't set off, said to\nFu and Sienan, looking utterly\nheartbroken. Just a few days ago, Lyn\nShao brutally murdered an entire Templar\nknight squad. The Knights Templar have\nsuffered a major blow. They've now\ndirectly announced to my Eastern Kingdom\nthat they will not return the principle\nand resources, nor will they share any\nprofits with us. This is a heavy blow to\nour Japanese empire. By the grace of\nAmitarasu, the great process of our\nJapanese nation in creating the greater\nEast Asia co-rossperity sphere has been\ndelayed once again. This responsibility\nmust be borne by the perpetrator Lin\nShao and the mismanaged Lan district.\nOh, right. Since Lin Shiao is the\ndisciple of the dragon Sia domain lord,\nyou all have an even greater\nresponsibility to shoulder. Kenzo Dohra\nadded. Lin Shao felt increasingly\nuneasy. Was this guy trying to get\nresources for nothing? He glanced at Chu\nYusi noticing his ashen face and\nimmediately asked with a cold laugh.\nWhat kind of compensation does Japan\nwant? This is all you're doing. Kenzo\nDohur said, \"Our Japan has always valued\nmorality. You have caused us losses and\ndelayed the progress of the greater East\nAsia co-rossperity sphere. We should\ncompensate you 10fold. Now that I'm\nassuming you're one of Lord Long Lia's\npeople, I'll just ask for double the\ncompensation. A total of 20 million\nstone or 20 million timber, 8 million\nrefined iron, 8 million refined copper,\n8 million refined copper, and 2 billion\ngold coins. Delivery within one week.\nThe crowd in the hall erupted in uproar\nonce again. The officials who had just\nquieted down began whispering and\ndiscussing among themselves again. So\nmuch Lynn Shiao has really given us a\nlot of trouble. The Eastern Japanese\nEmpire is far more powerful than our\nLong Shia. If we delay their plans, we\nwill suffer the consequences. I think\nthe domain lord shouldn't have taken in\nLin Shiao this jinx. What should we do\nnow? The envoy from Japan is quite\nreasonable. He only asked us to pay\ndouble the amount, which isn't too bad.\nLord City Lord, please agree quickly,\nlest Japan go back on its word. Seeing\nthis, Kenzo Deura nodded slightly in\nsatisfaction and added, \"Yes, yes,\nthat's all the resources.\" Hearing the\nofficials and fat man's words, Lynn Sha\nrolled his eyes so hard they almost\nreached the sky and Chu Yusi couldn't\nhelp but shout, \"Shut up all of you.\nKenzo Dohurra, let me ask you this. On\nwhat grounds should Lia compensate you\nfor your losses? Kenzo Dohuri looked\npuzzled and said, \"Your Lynn Shiao\ncaused us to lose everything. Shouldn't\nyou compensate us?\" \"Should what makes\nyou think you should? Your investment is\nyour business, and it's inherently\nrisky. You're responsible for your own\ngains and losses. The battlefield of\n10,000 races is a battlefield, and\nfighting and killing are normal. You're\nasking me to compensate you? That's\nuntenable, Lord Shu. What you said is\nincorrect. Seeing Chu Yusi's firm\nattitude, Kenzo Dohara explained, \"Our\nultimate goal is the rise of greater\nEast Asia so that all of us East Asians\ncan become a powerful force in the blue\nstar realm. Our investment in Japan this\ntime is also for the future of Langia.\nIsn't compensation the only right thing\nto do? Therefore, our Japanese nation\nhas been preparing for this goal for a\nlong time. We not only poured all the\nresources we had accumulated over 10\nyears into it, but even our women sold\ntheir jewelry and donated money and\ngoods to accumulate enough resources to\ninvest. Kenzo Dohura changed his\nexpression to one of grief, wiped away\nhis tears and said, \"In order to raise\nenough resources, some housewives and\nyoung girls even sold their bodies to\nexchange for that meager amount of money\nwhich they then donated entirely. Our\nJapanese empire has poured its heart and\nsoul into the common prosperity of\ngreater East Asia. We could have led\ndragon to the top of the world. But that\ndream has been ruthlessly shattered.\nTell me, don't you owe us compensation?\nThe officials looked at each other,\nshook their heads, and sighed. Alas,\nsince that is the case, Lia has indeed\ndone wrong. An official said, \"Long Shia\nis to blame for delaying the progress of\nyour countries and even our East Asia's\nprosperity.\" Lord City Lord, I believe\nwe should pay compensation. I'll pay you\nback my ass. Lynn Sha cursed,\ninterrupting the official. You guys are\nliving such a hilarious life. How dare\nyou come here demanding compensation.\nYou even have the nerve to mention money\nearned from selling a woman's body.\nAren't you ashamed? What do you mean by\nlosing 10 years worth of accumulated\nresources? Even a dog wouldn't believe\nthat. Kenzo Doer roared. Baka, I am the\nJapanese ambassador. What right do you\nhave to speak to me? Chapter 144.\nResource competition bet.\nQualifications, Lyn Sha said calmly. I\nam the domain lord's disciple. After\nbecoming a formal lord, I am equivalent\nto a regional reserve official. Besides,\nwhat qualifications do we need to speak\nto you? You are nothing more than a\nvillain from a small island in a tiny\ncountry here to extort money from us.\nLyn Sha thought to himself, \"The\nidentity you gave me, sister domain\nlord, is coming in handy now. I'll use\nyour name as a shield for now. You do\nroared in fury. Lord Chu, he's right.\"\nSeeing that two Fiuin was about to\nexplode, Chu Yusi waved his hand and\nsaid, \"Long Shia does indeed have such a\nregulation and Lin Sha is already a\nprospective official.\" Kenzo Dohur\nnarrowed his eyes and looked at Lyn Sha\nsaying, \"In that case, Lyn Shao, what\ndid you mean by what you just said?\" Lyn\nShao, I said what you just said was all\na string of lies. Baka, when\nhave I, Kenzo Dohra, ever lied? Lynn Sha\nsmiled slightly and said slowly. You\nsaid that you accumulated resources over\n10 years, invested them all, and ended\nup losing everything. That's completely\nunfounded. How dare you call yourselves\nthe Eastern Empire when you've only\naccumulated this much resource over 10\nyears. Doa said, \"Our people also suffer\nlosses, especially from fighting abroad.\nI think you've all been hiding\nsomewhere.\" Lyn Ziao&lt;unk&gt;s words\nstartled Kinszo Dehiraa, who was looking\nup at the sky with his hands behind his\nback. \"What you little people like to do\nmost is to import large quantities of\nresources from Lshia at low prices, seal\nthem up, and then sink them to the\nbottom of the sea. Then they would claim\nto be poor while extorting money from\nothers. When everyone is short of\nresources, you'll play the victim while\nsimultaneously bringing out the\nresources you've hidden and selling them\nback to Lia at a high price. What? Kenzo\nDohura and all the officials in the\ncastle lord's mansion were greatly\nshocked. Is this really true? Shuyusi\nasked. Absolutely. Lyn Shao replied\ndecisively. How could he not know what\nkind of world Little Life was? It was\nalmost identical to his original world.\nKenzo Dohurra broke out in a cold sweat,\nthen said firmly, \"We're&lt;unk&gt; preparing\nfor future dangers. Besides, what does\nour resource storage have to do with\nyour dragon? Then what does your\ninvestment failure have to do with our\nLia domain?\" Lyn Sha asked bluntly.\n\"You, you cunning, sly, and calculating\nbrat.\" The officials behind Lyn Sha were\nsomewhat agitated. Some of them saw the\nfat man get his comeuppance and the\narrogant ambassador was experiencing the\nsame feeling they had just gone through\nwhich made them feel inexplicably\nsatisfied. You mean to say someone is\nglib tonged? Lyn Sha shook his head.\nUnfortunately, your Japanese are not as\ngood at stealing culture as you are at\nextortion. Well said. A small group of\nthe lords who had come to report\nexclaimed in hush tones. Lyn Shiao had\ntruly given them a sense of\nsatisfaction. Humph. Seeing that his\nplan had failed, Kinszo Dohur said\ndirectly, \"Lord Shu, just tell me if\nyou're going to compensate us or not.\nOur losses are real. We in Japan have a\nsmall land area and few resources, but\nwe can collect resources quickly. So, of\ncourse, we need to store some resources.\nFurthermore, your Lone Sha region is\nsitting on a vast treasure trove, but\nunable to extract any resources. Your\nextraction efficiency is extremely low.\nMaking you lone sha pay compensation is\nindirectly forcing you to improve your\nefficiency. Ultimately, it's for your\nown good. Eh, excuses. All excuses. Who\nsays Lia's resource gathering speed is\nslow? Lyn Sha said, \"First, how fast we\ncollect resources is none of your\nbusiness, Japan. Second, our efficiency\nin collecting resources is in no way\nlower than yours.\" Let me give you a\npiece of advice. Stop trying to bully us\nin Lia. Yes, the newbie lords behind him\nsaid in unison. Chu Yusi also stated\ndirectly. No compensation. No\ncompensation. Isn't Lord Chu afraid that\nmy four kingdoms district and my\nneighbor Lan district will become mortal\nenemies? Isn't Lord Chu afraid that my\nfour kingdoms region and Lan region will\nopen the National Fortune Arena and\nstart a regional war? Kenzo Dehura said\nin a somber tone, \"If you don't want to\ncompensate, then hand over Lin Shiao. He\nhas disrespected our Eastern Kingdom,\nand we are going to take him back and\npunish him properly.\" Silence. Here they\ncome. Lyn Shao is here. Perhaps this is\nthe real purpose of Japan. Some\nonlookers have seen through Kinso\nDohur&lt;unk&gt;'s intentions. Shu Yusi also\nsuddenly became furious, walked straight\nup to Tu Feuin, and stared at him\ncoldly. Are you going to start a war\nwith Long Sa? Kenzo Dohura squinted and\nstared at Chu Yusi with a blank\nexpression. 10 seconds later, he slowly\nrelaxed. Lord Shu, you flatter me. Japan\nand Lia have been friendly countries\nthroughout history, and Lia has made\nmany contributions to the development\nand growth of Japan. Lord Shu, please\ncalm down and do not start a war\nlightly. Consideration from multiple\nperspectives before it can be launched.\nHowever, I do have an idea. After saying\nthat, Tufi Yuan changed the subject.\nSince this arrogant brat just said that\nyour dragon summer lord's resource\ngathering speed is no slower than my\neastern Japan lords, how about we make a\nbet? We will then engage in a resource\nrace. We, the Shikoku region of Japan,\nwill not bully you. We have more veteran\npowerhouses than you. How about we use\nthis year's rookie lords for the\ncompetition? Kenzo Dohara was\naggressive, scrutinizing Chu Yusi and\nLin Shiao from side to side. He could\nsee that Chu Yusi, the new city lord,\nhad a tough attitude, and Lyn Shao was\nalso taking a head-on approach, showing\nno fear of him whatsoever. If you lose,\nimmediately compensate my Shikoku region\nwith five times the resources, and hand\nLynn Shiao over to us to deal with. The\nofficials were shocked. Lord, you\nabsolutely must not gamble with the\nJapanese ambassador. We have no way to\ndefeat Japan. Just hand Lyn Sha over.\nThere's no need for compensation. Yes,\nLyn Sha has caused such a huge disaster.\nI'm sure the domain lord won't punish\nhim. If the city lord is unwilling to\nhand over Lyn Shiao, then let's accept\nthe previous agreement. Double\ncompensation is better than five times\nthe compensation if we lose. Chu Yusi\nreached out to stop the officials. What\nif we win? If Long Xiao wins, I\ncertainly won't need Lia to compensate\nme with any resources. Chu Yusi was\nabout to speak. What kind of good deal\nis that? Lyn Sha sneered. You lost and\nthere's no punishment at all. Kenzo Dyma\nsaid, \"Then what do you intend to do?\nSince you're going to compete, you must\nbear the same stakes.\" Lyn Shao said,\n\"You also have to compensate our Lnon\nregion with what you call five times the\nresources.\" Huh? You've got guts, Kenzo\nDohara. You dare to raise the price now?\nHow about we bet 10 times the resources?\n10 times it is. Shu Yusi agreed before\nLin Shiao even thought about it. As the\ncity lord, his words carried weight.\nExcellent, Lord Shu. What a spirit you\nhave. Kenzo Dohur said, \"In that case,\nwe can begin the competition now.\"\n\"Wait,\" Lyn Sha interrupted. \"What?\nScared? Regretful? The current stakes\nare not fair.\" Lin Sha said slowly. Even\nthough we both get 10 times the\nresources, if you win, you'll take me\nwith you. If we win, we'll only get 10\ntimes the resources.\nIf you really win, you can choose any of\nmy Japanese singers, court jesters, and\nactresses you want. As many as you\ndesire. The fat, round, and fleshy man\nflew up and said, \"But did you win? I\ndon't want you to call me an actress,\nactress, or anything like that. It's\nvulgar. If you lose, give this year's\nluck charm of the Shikoku region to my L\nnonan region. Do you dare to bet?\nChapter 145. 10 people gathered. Duga\njoins. They actually want to gamble with\nthe luck charm. Kenzo Dohyro&lt;unk&gt;'s\nheart tightened. Why is the death rate\nso high in the battlefield of the war of\nall races? It is cruel and bloody, yet\ncountless people flock to it. Because\noffers many benefits that others in the\nreal world cannot enjoy. This luck charm\nis one of them. Every year, the god\nsystem distributes a luck talisman to\neach region. After using the luck\ntalisman, it can increase the lifespan\nof everyone, improve the physical\ncondition of everyone, increase the\nresource production of the entire\nregion, and even expand the territory of\nthe region. This can be considered one\nof the most important items in a region,\nand most lords can enjoy the rewards of\nthe luck charm. Over time, many powerful\nlords, having enjoyed various rewards\nfrom the battlefield of all races for an\nextended period, have become superior to\nordinary humans. The battlefield of\nmyriad races, there are many women whose\nbeauty makes it impossible to guess\ntheir age, as well as experts who are\nalready several hundred years old. It is\nprecisely because of these endless\nrewards that the strong get stronger and\nit becomes extremely difficult to\nsurpass others. Linia's request for a\nluck talisman from the four countries of\nthe eastern Japan region which surprised\nKenzo Dohra slightly. Lin Shiao, do you\nthink you're worth a luck talisman? If\nyou think I'm not worth it, then you can\nskip the competition and just go back to\nthe Shikoku region. This competition was\nyour request, but that's because you\ncaused us to lose the Templars's\ninvestment. Aren't you annoying? They\nwent back on their word and tore up the\ncontract. Go find the Knights Templar\nthemselves. Lyn Xiao's thinking was\nclear and his logic was sound. He was\nable to grasp the key points and quickly\ncounter the loopholes in Kenzo Dohara's\nrhetoric. For a moment, even Shu Yusi\ndid not need to speak or argue. He only\nneeded to quietly watch Lin Shia argue\nhis point. Yes, every wrong has its\nperpetrator and every debt its debtor.\nIsn't the Western European region where\nthe Knights Templar are located known\nfor its strong sense of contractual\nobligation? They breached the contract,\nso make them pay compensation. What are\nyou doing coming to us? If you want to\ncompete and bet with us, then meet our\ndemands. Otherwise, get out. The lords\nbehind Lin Shiao also realized what was\nhappening. Having witnessed Lin\nXiao&lt;unk&gt;s repeated confrontations with\nthe Japanese ambassador, they felt more\nconfident and joined in supporting Lin\nShiao. Seeing that the situation in the\nhall was becoming increasingly out of\ncontrol, Kinszo Dehura sneered and said,\n\"Good, Lyn Shiao. You said it yourself,\nLord Shu. If we agree to wager the luck\ntalisman and 10 times the resources, are\nyou willing to take on the resource\naccumulation competition between the\nFour Kingdoms region and the Lnon\nregion?\nChu Yusi said in a deep voice, \"Of\ncourse, if your L nonan region loses,\nyou will have to compensate us with 10\ntimes the resources and hand Lynn Sha\nover to us to dispose of as we see fit.\"\nDo you agree? Approved. All right, let's\nsign the competition terms under the\nwitness of the main god system. The Four\nKingdoms region and the Dragon South\nregion will each send 10 lords who just\nentered the official server this year to\nparticipate in a resource accumulation\ncompetition starting today, lasting for\none week. The team that collects the\nmost resources within one week wins. Chu\nYusi tilted his head slightly and\nglanced at Lin Shiao only to see that\nLyn Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s gaze was firm and he\nlooked full of confidence. For no\napparent reason, his confidence in this\nyoung man he had always admired, as well\nas in Lin Shiao, whom even Dugun Nanuang\nvalued, grew even stronger. It's a deal.\nBoth parties pressed their fingerprints\nand signed the contract. Kenzo Dohara\nsuddenly burst into loud laughter. Haha.\nWithout lifting a finger, we are about\nto obtain 10 billion gold coins and\ncountless mineral resources. What do you\nmean? An official questioned. Kinszo\nDeharez said smuggly, \"Your Dragon\nIslands information is way behind the\ntimes. We, the Shikoku region of Japan,\nare your neighbors, yet you know nothing\nabout us. Our Shikoku region in Japan\nhas produced two unparalleled geniuses\nthis year. Sakura Shichiro and Roland.\nBoth of them possess S-rank talent.\nWe've also specially trained over a\ndozen resourcerich lords. You're doomed\nto lose this resource accumulation\ncompetition. What? Two S-ranked talents.\nThey even specially cultivated resource\ntype lords. The people in the hall were\nshocked. Kenzo Dohiro waved his sleeve\ntriumphantly and the group walked away,\ntheir wooden clogs clattering. Lord City\nLord, what should we do? An official\nsaid anxiously. Lord City Lord Lin Sha\nwas too reckless. He agreed to the\ncompetition with the Japanese just like\nthat. Now he has fallen into their trap.\nMy Lonan district is going to suffer a\nhuge loss. Enough with the nonsense. The\ncontract has been signed and the\ncompetition will begin immediately. I\nChui take full responsibility for my\nactions. If I lose, I will naturally go\nto the domain lord to ask for punishment\nand bear the consequences. You cower\nwhen you see foreigners, but you're very\nproud to bully your own people. All\nright. If you don't have any good\nsuggestions, then shut up. Chu Yusi\nsaid, \"Now, those who want to join this\ncompetition, please step forward. We\nneed 10 people.\" Lynn Shiao was the\nfirst to stand up. They're targeting me\nin this competition. I can go alone.\nWhat are S-rank talents and resource\ntype lords compared to this? Isn't my\nown eternal peace strong enough? Isn't\nmoving an entire mountain range enough?\nInitially, Lynhia's plan was to\nchallenge the Shikoku Islands region of\nJapan alone and teach them a lesson.\nHei, how could I miss such a great\nopportunity to teach Japan, which has\nbullied us for so long, a lesson?\nDinglay blinked and said, I'll join,\ntoo. I almost forgot about the little\nbrother who needs to show off. There are\nstill a few of us. A familiar voice came\nfrom inside. It was Chu Funga with red\nhair. Lin Shao were late, but we still\nwant to join in. Chufinga came over with\nJulie, Wong Bo, and Pans Shan Yu. They\nhad already reported for duty and gone\nback to rest, but they rushed over after\nhearing about the conflict between Lin\nShiao and the Japanese envoy. Okay,\nLynsha nodded. All of these people were\ngeniuses, and Pans Shan Yu was a\nresource type lord, so he could be\nconsidered an asset. We need four more\npeople. Anyone want to join? Those who\naren't afraid of death or being scolded,\ncome on over. Resource type lords are\npreferred. Ding Lay and Chuunga began to\nshout. The competition starts today and\nthe Lon region can no longer wait for\nthe lords who will report later. We can\nonly choose from the existing new lords.\nBut the good news is that everyone\nstanding in the hall right now is an\nelite from each newb zone, and there are\nno weaklings. Haha. How could the\nresource competition be complete without\nme? A young lord who had witnessed the\ntrouble caused by the Japanese kingdom\nin the hall stepped forward. My name is\nLu Xiaoying. I am not very talented, but\nI am the third lord to enter the\nofficial area this time. I also happen\nto be a resource type lord. I hope you\nwill take good care of me during the\ncompetition. Okay, thank you. Lyn Sha\nnodded. Resource-based lords usually\ndon't reveal their strengths. So, Lu\nXiaoing&lt;unk&gt;s initiative in mentioning\nhis own characteristics shows his\nupright character. I, Guangjuan, am\nwilling to join the competition. Another\nperson signed up. Shinuandu, count me\nin. I'm a combat type lord, but I'm\nconfident I won't hold you back when it\ncomes to resources. Nine people were\ngathered at once, but no one in the hall\nmade a sound. First, the competition\ncame suddenly and everyone had their own\nplans as soon as they entered the\nofficial area. Perhaps not wanting to\ncause any unforeseen complications. In\naddition to the passionate young people\nwho just signed up, most people are not\noptimistic about this competition bet\nand do not want to be blamed after\nlosing. \"Is anyone else here?\" Chufinga\nasked anxiously, searching around. The\nremaining novice lords either looked\naway or remained silent, offering no\nresponse. Lynn Sha nodded. Nine it is.\nWe can still fight them. Count me in. A\ncold, aloof voice rang out, and a\nstunningly beautiful woman in a blue\ndress moved gracefully and slowly\napproached. Chapter 146. The cold and\naloof goddess Dugu Jaolon. Dug Jaon,\nsquad leader. Lyn Shiao and Chufunga\nexclaimed in surprise, overjoyed. Dugu\nJaolon was radiant. Even surrounded by\ngeniuses in the hall, she still stood\nout from the crowd. Lin Shiao, don't\nforget that I was the first person to\nenter the official zone. Dugu Jaolon\nsaid slowly, her lips slightly parted. I\nhave already defeated you twice. Great,\nthat's fantastic, Chufinga exclaimed,\nshaking her head. With the class monitor\njoining us, our chances of winning have\nincreased even further. The two of you\nworking together as a couple will make\nthe work easier. You're like husband and\nwife. I mean classmates with perfect\nteamwork. You'll definitely be able to\ndefeat those despicable lords of the\nEastern Kingdom. Chufinga wiped his\nsweat. Lin Shiao, his best friend, was\nfine, but he didn't want Dugu.\nJaolon&lt;unk&gt;s hand, which was vaguely\nraised, to turn his hair green again.\nChu Yusi raised his hand. All right, now\nthat we've gathered 10 people, I won't\nwaste any more words. The competition\nwill begin in 1 hour. Lords, go back and\nprepare. Go for it. If you lose, I'll\ntake the blame. If you win, the entire\nLon region will thank you. Thank you,\nLord. City Lord. With the city lord's\nassurance, everyone felt more at ease.\nAnd after a brief greeting, immediately\nheaded to their respective territories.\nChufinga gave Lin Sha a look and was\nabout to wink and say something when she\nheard Chu Yusi sha from above. Yuanfil\nson, come here. Lyn Shao shook his head.\nEveryone in the hall had left. He looked\nup and saw Dugu Jaolon standing quietly\nnot far away, seemingly waiting for him.\nDugu Jaon Lin Shiao, we finally meet\nagain. Um, I have some questions for\nyou, Domain Lord. Domain Lord Duggan\nNonwang is my aunt, one of the direct\ndescendants of the Dugu family, and the\ncurrent patriarch of the Dugu family.\nDugu Jaolan winked at Lyn Shao and said\nsoftly, \"Keep it a secret for me.\" Lyn\nSha stood there stunned. He hadn't even\nasked yet, and Dugu had already told him\neverything. \"Okay, okay, I'll keep it a\nsecret for you,\" Lyn Shao stammered.\n\"Then why?\" \"Because I told her she\nneeded a cover identity,\" Dugu Jalon\nsaid. \"But when I went to her, she had\nalready decided to help you. How could\nmy classmate Dugu know my dear class\nmonitor Dugu know that I needed an\nidentity cover? Lyn Sha fell into a days\nagain and could only mutter. Okay, thank\nyou class monitor. But what about you,\nDugu? I watched the live stream. Dugu\nJalon said calmly. The demons things are\nso conspicuous and rumors about you and\nAndrea are spreading everywhere. She\nhasn't come out to say she'll take\nresponsibility for it, so I think you're\ngoing to be in trouble. You also know\nAnder? I know, succubus princess, a\npeerless expert of the sixth heaven, but\nthere's nothing between you and her. Lyn\nShia choked on his words, wondering why\nDugu Xolon had answered him before he\ncould even finish speaking. Wasn't she\nsupposed to be a cool and aloof goddess?\nWhy did she answer first? Is the Lord's\ntalent in my good class monitor mind\nreadading? Lyn Sha swallowed hard and\nlooked over again. He saw that although\nDugu Jaolan was still aloof and elegant,\nshe seemed to be looking at him with a\nhalf smile, as if waiting for his next\nquestion. Why are you helping me?\nEspecially since I'm such a suspect. I\nknow you inside and out, and I don't\nwant to let a genius like Long Sia go to\nwaste. Having finally asked the question\ncompletely, Lin Sha felt a sense of\naccomplishment. Dugu Jaolon&lt;unk&gt;s\nanswer, however, elicited a small\ninternal grumble from him. What does it\nmean to know someone inside and out? Do\nyou really know them? All right, squad\nleader Dugu. It's been so long since\nyou've seen me. Is there anything you\nwant to ask? Lyn Sha shrugged. Are you\nreally confident that you can take on 10\nlords of Japan all by yourself? Have\nWhat's the name of your hero in white?\nUh, pay. Show me the sword you were\nwielding when you fought the black\nflame. Give. Lyn Sha subconsciously took\nout Chi Xiao and was about to hand it to\nDugu Jaolon. In a fraction of a second,\nLyn Sha realized something was wrong.\nWhy would Dugu Jaolon suddenly asked me\nfor a weapon? This is too abrupt,\nespecially one of the 10 most famous\nswords in China that I possessed. Lyn\nShia had already drawn the Crimson Sky\nsword and was holding it scabbard. He\ndidn't know whether to put it back or\nhand it over. His eyes were filled with\nshock and disbelief as he looked at the\nstunning beauty before him. 10 million\nideas quickly churned in Liao&lt;unk&gt;s\nmind. \"Dugu Jaon merely glanced at Lyn\nXiao&lt;unk&gt;s sword sheath and nodded\nindifferently.\" \"Lin Xiao, you're quite\nvigilant.\" \"Dugu Ja on you?\" Lyn\nXiao&lt;unk&gt;s face turned cold, and he was\non high alert. With his personal safety\nand the safety of the entire ancient\nHasha race at stake, he had no choice\nbut to assume the worst about the\nintentions of his old classmate who had\njust helped him so much. Don't be\nnervous. Dugu Jaolon waved his long\nsleeves and a long sword appeared at his\nwaist without anyone noticing. A slight\nsmile slowly crept onto her lips as if\nshe was pleased to see Lin Xiao's\ndiscomfort. Dugu Jaolan&lt;unk&gt;s slender\nfingers traced the ancient sword at her\nwaist as she stared into Lin Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s\neyes and slowly said, \"This sword is\nnamed Ta.\" Having said that, Dugu Xolon\nturned and gracefully departed. Go and\nprepare for the competition, Mr. Torch.\nOh my god. Lin Shiao realized that it\nwas actually the Thai sword, which was\non par with Chi Sha, and even slightly\nsurpassed it. This sword was actually in\nDugu Jaolan's hands. Chi Xiao is the\nsword of an ancient demon and Tha is\nalso the sword of an ancient demon. So\nhow come it is in Dugu Jaolan&lt;unk&gt;s\nhands? Why would Dugu Jaolan tell me\nabout something so dangerous? What was\nshe trying to say? Lyn Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s mind\nwas in turmoil. Under Dugu Jaolon&lt;unk&gt;s\nsudden attack, he inexplicably took out\nChi Xiao. It seemed that Dugu also\nrecognized Chi Xiao, indicating that\nDugu Jaolon knew about his connection\nwith the ancient demon. Then Dugu X\nJaolon showed himself the Tha sword.\nWhat was she trying to do? Was she going\nto take him down with her? Or did she\nintend to? Does she also possess a\ndivine sword from China? Is she also\nconnected to ancient demons? One of our\nown. I found my people. Lyn Sha was\nsurprised, delighted, and apprehensive.\nSince Dugu Xolan knows something, does\nher aunt Duga Nonwang, the lord of the\ndragon summer domain, also know\nsomething? If Dugu Nanuang knows\nsomething, does that mean her actions\nare entirely under the surveillance of\nthe Lung Sha authorities? They were\nwatching my every move. Lynn Shiao dared\nnot be certain, nor dare he deny it. But\nat least those incompetent officials\ncertainly didn't know. Otherwise, they\nwould have already jumped up and sold\nthemselves out. Perhaps only members of\nthe Dugu Jaalon and Dugu Nonwang\nfamilies know this. Perhaps next time I\nsee Dug Jalon, I should ask him for\nclarification. Dugu Jalon, the aloof\ngoddess in front of outsiders. Seems\nquite mischievous to herself. Ah, Dugaju\nXi, my old squad leader. Didn't I just\ncall you old squad leader when we met\nlast time? Now I feel like you've been\nplaying me for a while. Having figured\nthis out and knowing that Dugu Xolon had\nno intention of harming him, Lyn Sha\nfelt relieved. He quickly opened a\nportal and returned to his own\nterritory. Soldren, call Sherry over.\nUh, no. I need to call all the blood\nwitches over here. I'm going to teach\nthem a lesson. Chapter 147 is the lorded\ndevil. After being whipped and scolded,\nthe blood witch Sherry slunk back to her\nmind with her witch sisters. He muttered\nto himself as he walked. I thought the\nlesson master was talking about was that\nkind of lesson, huh? He whipped me\npretty hard. Come on, Sherry. Master\ndidn't use much force. He still needs\nyou to mine. He wouldn't dare hurt you.\nA witch teased. But you with that cry,\neven your master was too embarrassed to\ndo anything. Even we blushed when we\nheard it. Shut up, you little brat.\nShirley said, figning anger. That's what\nyou call romance. Master must really\nenjoy the feeling of conquering Sherry.\nIt's all because sister Sherry gossiped\nabout our master. Neither our master nor\nAndrea are people we poor, helpless\nlittle bloodthirsty witches can talk\nabout. I think it's Shirley who likes\nbeing hit, right? If it's Lord Shirley's\nturn to draw, she'd certainly be\nwilling. You little I'm afraid\nnext time the Lord will send General\nChinley on you to beat you up. Haha.\nUggh. What nonsense are you talking\nabout? I'll pinch you if you don't.\nOuch. It itches. I'll scratch you, too.\nHe He The bloodthirsty witches chatted\nand laughed as they returned to their\nrespective mines. Behind him, a phantom\narcher wearing overalls hidden in the\nwoods, shook his head, and walked toward\nanother mining spot where the lord had\ntamed other wild monsters. The phantom\narcher arrived at the demon lord's lair\nand explained his purpose to the leader\nof the demon lords. What? Over time, the\ncyclops also received a notification\nfrom another phantom shooter. The\nmonsters throughout Calabash Valley were\nin an uproar, making a great commotion.\nDozens of phantom archers moved among\nthem, notifying the various monster\ngathering points. Overtime. Great. I\nlove overtime. Long live the Lord. I\nlove working overtime, too. My lord, I\nlove you. I love my job. I'm addicted to\nmy job. The clamor and cheers from the\nvalley could be heard even by Lin Sha\nwho was reviewing the mission log in the\nwarh hall remained wary of the monsters\nin the valley and she asked what method\ndid you use lord why are the monsters in\nthe valley so happy men also looking\nrather idle crossed his arms and said I\nhave traveled the world for many years\nand have never seen anyone say that they\nlike working overtime let alone monsters\nwhat ability did you use to convince\nthem lord Lyn Sha kept his eyes fixed on\nthe latest sand table and didn't even\nlook up. It's simple. It's about money.\nWhat? It's about giving them enough\nrewards. Lynsha said, \"These monsters\noccupy the minds just to mine them and\nthen use the mind resources to exchange\nfor food from the god system. They work\nso hard just to fill their stomachs. The\ngod system doesn't bargain with wild\nmonsters. No matter what kind of mineral\nvein it is, it's just the most basic\nguarantee of food to exchange for an\nequal number of wild monsters. So, these\nmonsters are like the poorest working\nclass in the god system. Get up earlier\nthan the chickens, sleep later than the\ndogs, work harder than the oxen, and\nworry every day about being wiped out\nand turned into experience packs by the\nnearby lords with their troops. Payman\nwiped his eyes so pitiful. I really felt\nsorry for him. Lynn Shiao raised his\nfoot and kicked Pay Min away. You, a sly\nold fox who always tries to muddle\nthrough, can actually empathize. Even\nHoy Subing, the passionate young man who\nalways had a stern expression, laughed\nin the warh hall. The atmosphere was\nrelaxed when he was with Lyn Sha without\nthe worry of being in a dangerous\nsituation, which made him feel sincere\nrespect and love for Lyn Sha. So, the\nLord gave these monsters food. Chin Lean\nYu was still wearing her silver soft\narmor, her ponytail tied high, and with\nher bright red cloak, tall figure, and\nthree-dimensional and beautiful\nfeatures, she was truly heroic and\nincomparably beautiful. That's right.\nSince the god system is so stingy, I,\nthe new boss, will be more generous. I\nhad the Phantom Archer deliver a\nmessage. For the next week, we&lt;unk&gt;ll\nhave them work overtime 24/7. and on my\nside. Lynn Shia smiled faintly. We'll\nprovide them with extra spirit rice\nporridge and spirit fish soup. Golden\nlegendary spirit rice. The golden\nlegendary spirit fish. The crowd gasped\nin disbelief. All the wild monsters in\nthe valley were so happy as if they had\ngone mad. Golden legendary quality\nspirit rice and golden legendary quality\nspirit fish can randomly increase one of\nthe following attributes by two points.\nstrength, spirit, constitution, or soul.\nIt can improve the user's skill level up\nto a maximum of B-grade. Most\nimportantly, it has a chance to extend\nthe user's lifespan and maintain a\nyouthful appearance. The legendary\ngolden rice and fish that are impossible\nto obtain outside are now readily\navailable to all heroes and troops under\nLyn Xiao's command, and there's an\nincreasing supply of them. My golden\nlegend farmers now number over 200.\nEvery day, the Golden Legend farmhouse\ncontinues to produce golden legend\nfarmers. And each Golden Legend farmer\ncomes with its own golden legend spirit\nfield of the spirit field is five times\nthe normal amount. We can't possibly eat\nit all. The monsters in the valley\ncrazy. Your lordship has made a truly\nwise decision, the heroes exclaimed in\nunison. This is just an appetizer,\nLynsha said calmly. Now that the\nmonsters in the valley are no longer\nfighting each other, they can save their\ncombat and guard forces for labor, which\nincreases the labor force. At the same\ntime, we can divide the monsters in each\nvein of the valley into three shifts\nwith the three shifts taking turns to\nwork and rest, which can also improve\nefficiency. I had the phantom archers\ntake the golden legendary farmers and\nset up several points in the valley.\nThey provided four meals a day,\nbreakfast, lunch, dinner, and a midnight\nsnack, directly distributing spirit rice\nporridge. This way, the monsters didn't\nhave to cook for themselves, saving them\ntime and allowing them to mine more\nresources. Finally, these monsters can\nalso allow female monsters and young\nmonsters to join in mining. With these\nincentives, the monsters should be able\nto unleash several times their\nproductivity. It's barely good enough.\nLynn Sha stroked his chin and slowly\nsaid, \"This lord isn't some kind of\ndevil. While there are no labor laws or\nlaws protecting miners yet, those wicked\ncapitalists can flee us as much as\npossible.\" \"Huh? Why are you all looking\nat me like that?\" Lyn Sha suddenly\nnoticed that the way his heroes and\nsquad leaders were looking at him had\nchanged. \"My lord, are you really having\nan affair with Andrea?\" Payman asked,\nstunned. \"What nonsense are you talking\nabout? Don't you know what kind of\nperson I Lin Shia am? Then why are the\nLord's methods so ruthless? More\nruthless than the devil himself. He\ndoesn't treat monsters like monsters at\nall. He's trying to squeeze them dry.\nLyn Sha chuckled and shook his head. In\nmy previous life, even worse than this.\nMany people want good fortune, but can't\neven get it. You're all so scared\nbecause I only used some petty tricks\nfrom those ruthless bosses in my past\nlife. These monsters are so physically\nstrong. It's a real shame they don't\nwork overtime and become corporate\nslaves. Lyn Sha simply offered a brief\nexplanation which caused the heroes and\ngenerals in the war hall to break out in\na cold sweat once again. All right,\nlet's take a look at the terrain. As for\nthe resource competition, let the wild\nmonsters handle it. I have a backup\nplan. Our goal is to eliminate the\nundead forbidden zone heroes in the\nofficial zone and obtain the undead orb.\nChapter 148. the forbidden zone of the\ndead far ahead. While the competition\nfor resources is one thing, the\ndevelopment, expansion, and upgrading of\none's own territory must continue. For\nLin Sha, the resource competition and\nbetting was just a side activity. He\nalways felt a sense of urgency to\nupgrade and become stronger immediately.\nNo one knows how long they can keep\ntheir Chinese identity hidden. Once\nexposed, they will be in grave danger.\nWhen he was first reborn, his ideal of\nbecoming a powerful lord was now\nreplaced by a sense of urgency about\nlife and death. There are now 56 Phantom\narchers. Soldering is leading them to\npatrol the valley and maintain order for\nthe weak. Yes, sir. Soldering replied.\nEveryone else, follow me. We're going\nhere. Lynsha pointed his finger at the\nWarand table. It was a place shrouded in\nblack mist, hidden among towering\nmountains. The land was rotten and the\nground emitted a foul stench. Even the\ntrees and vegetation there were withered\nand decaying. That place is a forbidden\nzone for the dead. In the beginner zone,\napart from the book of the dead and a\nfew necromancy skills, novice lords will\nbasically cannot encounter the undead\nrace. This is because the undead race\nhas all come to the official zone and\nthey have banded together to form a\nunique undead forbidden zone. The\nforbidden lands of the dead are\nscattered throughout the various regions\nof the official district, varying in\nsize. Some are almost comparable to a\nlarge citystate, while others are no\nsmaller than the territory of a powerful\nlord in the official district. It can be\nsaid that every forbidden zone of the\nundead is one of the toughest nuts to\ncrack in the official zone. There are\nall sorts of undead units and monsters\nthere, including skeletons, zombies,\nvampires, ghosts, liches, horror\nknights, and stitch butchers. The larger\nundead forbidden zones even have\nlegendary golden monsters like the\nrotten spider mother and the undead\nreaper, and even frost dragons of\nunknown quality. Each undead forbidden\nzone is guarded by an undead hero. So,\nwhy would the lords of the official\ndistricts attack the undead forbidden\nzone? First, the experience points are\nvery high. Second, there are generous\nmaterial rewards. However, many people's\nmain goal is still the undead orb. With\nthis item, you no longer need to\nmanually upgrade your heroes and units\nall the time. Instead, they will upgrade\nautomatically, making it a true\nhands-free wonder. This is why Lynn Shia\nset his sights on the Undead Forbidden\nZone the moment he arrived in the\nofficial area. The Undead Forbidden Zone\nhas a random element. it won't stay in\none place. They will appear from\ndifferent places from time to time and\nafter a period of time they may suddenly\ndisappear. This results in the existence\nof some undead forbidden zones\nregardless of the size of the official\nzone. Lyn Shao entered the main area and\nused the celestial perspective where he\nhappened to see a medium-sized undead\nforbidden zone. Based on the size and\nthe buildings within the restricted\narea, there shouldn't be a frost dragon.\nAt most, there could be a stitching\nbutcher or a dread knight. Lyn Shiao\nsaid to his generals, \"The stitcher\nbutcher is also of epic quality, and the\ndread knight is of legendary quality.\nThere are probably quite a few of them.\nSo this time, everyone except soldering\nwill set off together.\" \"Yay men, if an\nundead hero appears, you will handle it\nas usual.\" Pay Min made an exaggerated\nreceived gesture. \"My twin swords are\nitching for a fight.\" Lynn Shia rolled\nhis eyes. That's because your impulsive\npersonality makes you unsuitable for\nleading troops. All right, enough\nchitchat. Let's get the undead orb and\nupgrade to Town Hall 4 as soon as\npossible. Let's get started. Inside a\nwooden lord's mansion that resembles an\nancient Chinese palace, yet bears\nnumerous traces of imitation. Hiroshi\nDoy sat on the ground looking at the two\nyoung men in front of him. Sakura\nShichiro Roland, I made this bet hastily\nthis time. Do you two young talents have\nthe confidence to beat Lan District?\nDon't worry, senior. We&lt;unk&gt;ll make sure\nthat Lan region loses convincingly and\nhands over 10 times the resources and\nLin Sha obediently. Ingielong replied\nimmediately. Roland added, \"Rest\nassured, my lord, we are both S-rank\ntalents and each of us has four resource\ntype lords under our command. With this\nconfiguration, we might not lose even if\nwe were to compete with geniuses from\nWestern Europe or the Americas.\nThe contract established by the God\nsystem cannot be revoked, even if they\nwant to. The moment the resource\ncompetition ends, the resources of the\nLan region will be transferred to our\nfour kingdoms region. A single bet can\nbring me nearly half a year's worth of\nresource benefits across Japan. Even if\nPrime Minister Hideki Tojo and General\nIsuroku Yamamoto knew about it, they\nwould only praise me. Your senior is\nwise. However, Kenzo Dohurra slowly put\ndown his teacup and pondered that Lynn\nShiao confronted me to my face and even\nrallied other novice lords to oppose the\nEastern Empire. I think Lyn Sha is also\ninvolved in Lord Chu Yusi's tough\nstance. Therefore, we can't let that kid\nLyn Sha lose so easily. Sakura Shiro\nasked in confusion. Senior, didn't the\nbet stipulate that if we won, we would\nhand Lin Sha over to us?\nThat was just a delaying tactic. Do you\nthink my great Eastern Empire needs a\nLin Sha? It was just that Pu Dawei from\nthe heavenly realm asked me to do this.\nPu Dawei only wanted Lin Sha dead, but\nin front of Chu Yusi, I changed my mind\nand said that I would take Lin Sha away\nto deal with him. Kenzo Dohur said, \"If\nLin Shiao dies during the competition,\nthe bet is unfair and we can demand. We\ndemand that the Lnon district also pay\nwith a luck charm.\" Senior, what\nskillful methods, sir? What skillful\nmethods? Kenzo Dohara stroked his\nmustache with satisfaction, then said,\n\"Go and prepare. You two focus on\naccumulating resources. I will send a\nninja lord to deal with Lin Shia.\" \"Yes,\nsenior.\" A dozen minutes later, the\nresource competition began on time. The\nmain god system made an announcement in\nthe Lnon region and the neighboring four\nkingdoms region and then displayed the\npanels of both sides of the competition\nprominently in the announcement area.\nThroughout the competition, the\nparticipating players from both sides\nand the amount of resources they have\naccumulated are all displayed on the\nresource panel and updated in real time.\nAfter the competition ends, the winner\nwill be announced and the prize will be\nawarded. Look, the Lon region and the\nShikoku region of Japan are fighting.\nThe two official regions have more than\ntens of millions of people, and some\nsharpeyed people have already seen the\nannouncement. Only been the district\nhead of Lan district and the city lord\nof Lan City for a few days, and he's\nalready made headlines. Haha, as\nexpected of the madman of Jong Dong. I\nlike him. Come on. Japan is a developed\ncountry and the Shikoku Islands region\nhas many experts. Our Lon region's\nveteran experts are simply outnumbered\nby them. How can we fight? Wrong.\nSomeone said wrong. This isn't a\ncompetition among veteran masters, but\nrather a competition among young lords\nwho have just entered the official zone.\nA competition of young talents.\nEveryone's interest was peaked. Who can\nrepresent our Lnon region? The panel\nshows the names of the contestants from\ntwo different zones. Go check it out\nyourself. Holy crap, it's Lin Sha. Lyn\nShia is in first place and he's far\nahead of everyone else. Chapter 149\nsenior. We can win. The match between\nthe two sides had only been going on for\nan hour. In the announcement area of the\nmain god system, the resource collection\ninformation of both sides participating\nin the competition is displayed at a\nglance. Resource collection data for the\nShikoku region. Sakura Shichiro 120,000,\nRoland 110,000, Banjong 3,500,\nXiaoyu and Isu 0.32 million. Togo Nichi\ntotal in the Shikoku region 252,000.\nfrom the four kingdoms region\naccumulated a total of 110,000 and\n120,000 resources respectively in just\none hour which is quite fast. Why are\nonly two people from Japan accumulating\nsuch terrifying speeds while the rest\nare so slow? Yes, give me an hour and I\ncould probably get more than 5,000\nresources in total. Some people have\nraised questions. The total resources\ninclude all mineral resources, whether\nit is iron or copper or stone, wood or\nany buildings that produce resources\nsuch as your own farmland and fish pond.\nAs long as new resources appear, they\nare included in the total resources. Ah,\nthis is all thanks to the vassel lord.\nLu Xiaoiing, one of the contestants from\nthe Lan region who spoke. He explained\nthe accumulated resources of vassal\nlords can be counted under the name of\nthe lord. So someone replied the reason\nwhy the top two lords in Japan have such\nterrifying statistics is because the\nother lords are all their vassal lords.\nLu jaoing slowly said that's right.\nMoreover, the other eight lords from\nJapan who participated in the\ncompetition were all resource-based\nlords. What eight resource-based lords\nbecome vassel lords? If they were just\nordinary lords, Sakura, Shichiro, and\nRoland couldn't have accumulated\nresources so quickly. You see, the other\nlords only have a resource gathering\nspeed of around 0.3. That's because\nthey've reserved the most basic\nnecessities for their territories\nfarmers. All the other resource\ngathering data is credited to the top\ntwo lords. Everyone was surprised and\nasked, \"So, Lyn Sha has nine resource\ntype lords as Vasselords? What are you\nsaying? Lynn Shiao didn't have any\nvassel lords in this competition, but\nwhy are his stats so unbeatable?\nEveryone quickly looked at the LG Nan\nranking list, which they had previously\ndared not look at. Resource collection\ndata for Lan District. Lin Shiao\n260,000.\nDugu Jaolon 49,000. Lu Xiaoing 32,000.\nPan Shan Yu 31,000. Dingle 25,000.\nChufinga 23,000,\nJulie 22,000, Chunuandu 21,000,\nGuanghuan 15,000, Wongbo 0.9 million.\nSummary of Lan region, 487,000.\nLan region is far ahead of the other\nfour regions. My god, what am I seeing?\nThe Lan region is even stronger than the\nShikoku region of Japan. Are we going to\nwin? Don't get too excited. Someone\npoured cold water on the idea.\nResource-based lords are all longasting\nand have great potential. The longer\nthey are around, the more their\nstrengths will be revealed. Perhaps they\ncan catch up in speed later on. What are\nthey catching up to? Someone exclaimed.\nIs Lyn Shia a resource type lord? How\ncome Lyn Sha alone has more people than\nall of Japan combined? Lyn Sha alone has\n260,000 while the 10 lords of the four\nkingdoms combined only have 252,000.\nDamn, I didn't believe Lyn Sha could\neasily defeat and completely crush Black\nFlame in the newbie zone, but now I do.\nThe domain lord is truly amazing to have\ntaken in such a super genius as Lin Sha.\nAmidst the shock of everyone in the\nRunan region, Kenzo Dohara of the\nShikoku region was also furious. You\ntoo. Why is that kid Lynn Sha so\npowerful? Why is it that his resource\ncollection data alone is more than all\nof yours combined? Sakura Shichiro and\nRoland knelt on the ground and were\nimmediately berated by Kenzo Dehiraa\nsenior. I think Lynn Shiao may have used\nsome kind of secret method that\noverdraws life force, forcing farmers to\ncollect resources beyond their capacity.\nSakura Shiro said cautiously. Maybe we\nshould wait and see. Maybe the data will\nreverse later. Let's wait and see. 1\nhour later. Lin Xiao's resource\ncollection data 520,000.\nThe entire Shikoku region 505,000.\nSenior, let's wait and see. Perhaps Lyn\nXiao's dosage is too high. We can wait a\nlittle longer. His farmers certainly\nwon't be able to hold on. Another hour\nlater, Lyn Xiao's resource collection\ndata 780,000.\nThe entire Shikoku region, 748,000.\nSenior, it's almost lunchtime. Lynn Sha\nwill slow down. Senior, it's getting\ndark soon, and those who gather\nresources need to rest. Senior, please\nallow Prince Roland, the cow herd, to\nserve you in bed. Senior, don't worry.\nWe've already had some resourcerich\nlords work overtime to gather resources\nat night. Just wait for good news first\nthing tomorrow morning. Senior, please\nenjoy your night. Senior, I guarantee\nthat we will crush Lin Shia and Lon\ndistrict tomorrow. Good morning, senior.\nYou idiot. Don't you dare call me\nsenior. Baka, look at the mess you've\nmade. See if you've kept your promises.\nSakura Shichiro opened the god\ncompetition panel with a look of\nastonishment. Resource collection data\nfor the Shikoku region. Sakura Shichiro\n880,000.\nRoland 850,000\ntotal in the Shikoku region 1.79 million\nresource collection data for L nan\ndistrict Lin Shao 3.12 million total for\nL nan district 3.84 84 million. This\nsenior baka, I told you not to call me\nsenior. I don't have such disgraceful\njuniors like you. Kenzo Dehura slapped\nSakura Shichiro across the face,\nknocking him to the ground, and then\nkicked Roland, who had just gotten out\nof bed, showing no mercy whatsoever. He\nwas so angry he was about to explode.\nAll the resource lords under his command\narranged for half of their farmers to\nwork overtime at night to mine\nresources. As a result, when they woke\nup, Lyn Sha had almost doubled their\nresources. Baka Lyn Sha, that bastard.\nDoesn't he need to sleep? Don't his\nfarmers get tired? Don't they need to\nsleep? Damn it. Lyn Sha must die,\notherwise we might really lose. Kenzo\nDohara opened the communication panel\nand called the ninja lord. Mamataro,\nhow's the progress? Reporting to our\nlord. We have infiltrated Lan District,\nbut still have not found Lin Xiao's\nlocation. Huh? Even using ninja dogs\nwon't work. No, Lin Shiao has no\nresidual aura. Even using secret methods\nto rewind doesn't work. No. Tao San Lang\nused a secret technique to rewind and\nsaw Lin Sha step into a portal, but\nthere was nothing on the other side of\nthe portal, so we couldn't see anything.\nMama Sabiro wanted to activate the\nsecret technique to get a closer look,\nbut suddenly a terrifying face appeared\nin the teleportation portal. Mamataro\nreported in a terrified tone. Then Mama\nSaburro fainted and hasn't woken up yet.\nWhat kind of face? It was a huge face\nresembling both a fox and a human, but\nwith shorter cheeks covered in sharp\nfangs and with eyes that were entirely\nwhite, staring straight at people. Kenzo\nDohurra shivered. My lord, your\nsubordinate is incompetent and cannot\nfind Lin Xiao's location. Please punish\nme. All of you who are useless, may you\nall commit sepuku. Kenzo Dohurra waved\nhis hand and shut down the communication\ndevice under Mamaro&lt;unk&gt;s incredulous\ngaze. I must find a powerful Jonan to\ndeal with Lin Sha. Kenzo Dohura muttered\nto himself. However, among the 10 lords\nin the Lnon region, Dugu Jaolon,\nShufinga, Dinglay, and those two\nresource type lords are also quite\ncapable. Even if we deal with Lin Shiao,\nwe won't leave them too far behind. It\nseems that we have no other choice but\nto use that method. Kenzo Dohara's two\neyes, like marbles embedded in his fat,\nlooked at the motionless Sakura,\nShichiro, and Roland, his gaze sweeping\nback and forth between them. Chapter\n150. Bowing. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.\nMeanwhile, Lyn Sha, along with all the\nheroes and troops, had used precise\ncoordinates to open several portals and\narrived at a distance not far from the\nforbidden zone of the dead. Having a\ngod's perspective is great. Murder,\nrobbery, and escape are all essential.\nLynn Shia made a self-deprecating remark\nand looked at the stunningly beautiful\nenchantress following behind him. Ba,\nyour first battle is going to be a major\none. Are you afraid? Wearing a scarlet\ncloak that covered her entire body,\nrevealing only her stunningly beautiful\nface, Baoi smiled gently upon hearing\nthis. Lyn Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s first impression of\nBaoi was that she was gentle and weak,\nbut at this moment, she seemed\ncompletely unaffected. Her face was\nfair, her nose was small and delicate,\nand her large eyes always seemed to be\nfilled with mist, arousing a strong\ndesire to protect her. Even outside the\nforbidden zone of the dead, where a\nchilling aura that would terrify\nordinary people, was just a 100 meters\naway, Ba still exuded an amazing charm\nat all times. This humble servant thanks\nyour excellency for your concern.\nHowever, my lord, you should not\nunderestimate me. I understand how\ncapable you are. I've never\nunderestimated you. Lyn Sha lowered his\nvoice, causing Bao's cheeks to flush\nred. Paymen's ears perked up again. His\ngaze swept suspiciously towards Lyn Sha,\nthen glanced at Baoi, whose pretty face\nwas flushed. He was about to speak. Pay\nattention. Keep quiet. Do not move\naround. Do not whisper. Chin Leongu s\nvoice came over. As the\ncommander-in-chief of this operation, I\nmust repeatedly emphasize military\ndiscipline, and those who violate it\nwill be punished according to military\nlaw.\" After saying that, she looked at\nLyn Sha meaningfully and said\nindifferently, \"Lord, you are the same.\"\nLyn Sha shrugged with a rise smile,\nlooking like he had been caught\nred-handed making a mistake. Chin Leonu\nturned her head, her red cloak, silver\nsoft armor, high ponytail, and\nincomparably beautiful features, making\nher a stunning beauty of a different\ntype. Almost on par with Baoi, heroic\nand radiant. As a general specializing\nin mountain warfare, Chin Leang Yu was\nmostly straightforward and\nunpretentious, leading her troops like\nbrothers and even daring to give orders\nto Lord Lyn Sha. No one noticed that as\nChin Leang Yu turned her head, a\nbreathtaking smile appeared on her lips.\nOnly Pay Min quietly gave a thumbs up to\nHoitsubing, the young general in golden\narmor, who was completely unaware of\nwhat was happening. \"All right, we've\narrived at our destination,\" Chin Lean\nYu ordered. \"My lord, please activate\nthe celestial perspective to confirm the\nenemy once again.\" Lyn Sha nodded and\nclosed his eyes. His perspective flew\nout from his body, soaring higher and\nhigher. He manipulated his viewpoint,\ncarefully surveying every soldier and\nevery building in the forbidden zone of\nthe undead before him. The memory palace\nwas activated and Lyn Sha began to\nmemorize. A few minutes later, Lyn Sha\nopened his eyes. 100 paces to the west\nof the valley ahead, there are 12 cave\ndemons hiding. 200 paces ahead, there\nare 130 putrid zombies. The third grove\nof decaying trees is teeming with\nghosts. At the center of the restricted\narea, to the east are 20 stitched\nbutchers, and to the west are 31 dread\nknights. The strongest undead hero\ndiscovered so far as the crypt lord, who\nis surrounded by many putrid beetles.\nLyn Sha spoke rapidly, reciting all the\ntroop distributions he had memorized.\nWhen he opened his eyes, he found all\nthe generals staring at him in shock. A\nmoment of silence. Why are you all\nlooking at me like that? Lyn Shao asked\ncuriously. With our lord here, General\nLee Guuang will never get lost. Huing\nremarked. With the Lord here, Chin Leang\nYu and the White Spear soldiers can move\nswiftly through the mountains. Chin\nLeang Yu said longingly. With the Lord\npresent, an assassin sneak attack is\nvirtually impossible, Pay Min said\nbefore Lin Shia interrupted him. All\nright. All right. You can flatter me\nlater. I'll listen to your praises\ncomfortably when we get back to our\nterritory. Lynn Shiao said solemnly.\nNow, obey Chin Leong Yu&lt;unk&gt;s orders and\nfinish the battle at hand. Yes, sir. The\nheroes replied in unison. Lyn Sha nodded\nsilently, but inwardly he was quite\npleased with himself. Look at the kind\nof people praising themselves.\nHitsubing, who sealed the wolf's lair,\nChin Leang Yu, the loyal marquee of the\nMing dynasty, and Pay Min, the sword\nsaint of the Tang Dynasty. These are all\nprominent figures in Chinese history,\nand they all greatly admire the skills\nthey have painstakingly honed. Young\nMaster Pay Min, prepare for battle. Chin\nLeong Yu has begun issuing orders.\nGeneral Hua, please take command of the\ncentral army and lead the Guan Ning\ncavalry. Miss Baoi, please use\nconcealment. White pole soldiers lead\nthe way. Emo Dao soldiers bring up the\nrear. Guan Ning cavalry dismount. Their\nhorses gagged. Divine arm archers take\ndown their bows and crossbows and\nprepare to fire. From this moment until\nthe crypt lord is killed, no one shall\nmake a sound. Everyone nodded\nemphatically and quickly formed a line.\nThe small team of several hundred people\nplunged silently into the dark,\nforbidden land of the undead. What? You\nwant us to kill our own kind and steal\ntheir resources? Sakura Shiro was\ngreatly surprised. Damn it. How dare you\nshout like that? What are you doing\nhere? Kenzo Dohura slapped Sakura\nShichiro across the face again. If you\ntwo weren't so useless, I wouldn't have\nresorted to this drastic measure. If you\nlose this bet and lose all these\nresources and luck charms, neither of\nyou will survive. Koko, how are we going\nto tell our people? Baka, what else do\nyou want to say? Do you apologize to\nthem before you kill them? They are all\nyoung lords under my command. Do you\nthink I don't feel sorry for them? Kenzo\nDohara&lt;unk&gt;'s eyes widened like glass\nbeads, and the fat on his face twitched.\nGet it done right away. Yes, sir.\nSakura, Shichiro, and Roland dared not\ndisobey and could only bow and nod. A\nportal appeared out of thin air in a\nyouth territory in the Shikoku region.\nThe teleportation portal was extremely\nprecise, landing precisely in the guest\narea of the Lord's manor without\ntriggering any alerts or backlash. A\nlord of medium build with a slender and\ndelicate body as graceful as a woman\nstepped out. He held a long samurai\nsword and wore a kimono which made him\nlook like a handsome god. The young lord\nwas surprised to see a guest but when he\nturned around he was overjoyed. Sakura\nShikarukuan, you've come to visit me.\nThe young lord happily went to greet\nhim. The arrival of the renowned number\none genius of the four kingdoms is truly\na cause for great joy. Uh what are you\ndoing? Sakura Shichiro coldly pulled the\nsamurai sword from the young lord's\nbody, letting the blood splatter, and\nthe young lord slowly fell to the ground\nin disbelief. I'm sorry. I need all your\nresources. There's a bug in the resource\ngathering competition. Even resources\nobtained by killing other players are\ncounted as gathered resources. We can't\nfind Lyn Shia. Killing one or two lords\nin the Lnon region will likely attract\nattention and delay our progress. So,\nSakura Shichiro coldly waited for his\nheroes and troops to wipe out all the\nyoung lords resistance forces and then\nbreak into the warehouse. The moment the\nmain god system notification sounded,\nSakura Shichiro happily narrowed his\neyes. Then, he took a step back, his\nexpression turning solemn, bowed towards\nthe young lord's corpse. I'm sorry, I've\ncaused you trouble. I'm sorry. It's come\nto this now. Chapter 151. Brother Shiao,\nI really followed the right person. Just\nas Lin Sha led most of his troops and\nheroes through the forbidden zone of the\nundead, a lord from the Lan region\nnoticed changes in the data on the\ncompetition bulletin board. Look, look,\nthe top two players in the Shikoku\nregion are accumulating resources at an\nalarming rate. Sakura Shichiro now has\n1.08 million followers, 1.29 million,\n1.52 million. My god, how did his\nnumbers rise by tens or hundreds of\nthousands in just a few minutes? And\nRoland 2. Roland's already worth 1.49\nmillion. No, 1.75 million. Sakura\nShichiro has already reached 1.93\nmillion. What did resources fall from\nthe sky? Even if resources fell from the\nsky, they wouldn't arrive this quickly.\nAmidst the gasps of the crowd, the data\nof the two prodigies from the fornation\nregion visibly and rapidly increased\nwith each jump amounting to tens or\nhundreds of thousands. In less than half\na day, Sakura Shichiro and Roland had\ncollected a total of 6.01 million\nresource data. Total data collected for\nthe entire Lan district is only 5.98\nmillion. Everyone panicked. Young lords\nof Lonan district, what's wrong with\nyou? How did the lords of the four\nkingdoms district overtake you? Hurry up\nand catch up. The Shikoku region is\nmoving too fast. Who's the boss here?\nCome out and solve this problem.\nMeanwhile, Ding Lay, Shuunga, and others\nwho participated in the resource\ncompetition also discovered the anomaly\nin the Four Kingdoms region. Dinglay\ntried to contact Lin Shiao, but received\nno response. Brother Shiao said he was\ngoing to take care of something\nimportant and might shut down\ncommunications. How come the people from\nthe four kingdoms region overtook us at\nthis crucial moment? This is simply not\nscientific. I've checked the books and\nbrother Xiao speed has already broken\nthe historical best record, even far\nsurpassing the old record. How could\nsomeone be faster than Brother Xiao and\nbe able to surpass him? Ding Lays gaze\nshifted to the competition panel where\nhe saw the following text. Resource\ncollection data for Lnon district. Lin\nShiao 3.51 million. Dugu X Jaolon\n960,000.\nLu Xiaoing 540,000.\nPan Shan Yu 510,000.\nDingle 290,000.\nChufinga 280,000.\nLan District total 6.29 million. Lynn\nShiao remains far ahead of all other\ncontestants, single-handedly carrying\nthe banner of the Lung Nan region, but\nhe's now out of contact. Dinglay was a\nlittle anxious. Just now, the total\nnumber of resources collected in the Lan\nregion has reached 6.29 million, but the\ndata for the Sigua region is even more\nalarming, now reaching 6.48 million.\nResource collection data for the Shikoku\nregion. Sakura Shichiro 3.2 million.\nRoland 3.18 million. Banan Jhong Ron\n32,000 Xiaoyu and Ishu 28,000. Total for\nthe Shikoku region 6.488\nmillion. Panic spread through the chat\nchannels of the LN region. Many lords\nhave already begun to complain that Chu\nYusi should not have accepted this\ncompetition bet. Losing it will only\nmake things worse for Lia. Losing Lynn\nShiao is not a big deal, but the T-fold\nresource compensation will indeed\nthe entire Lan region for a long\ntime. All four regions in Japan are\nstrong regions, and Dragon Summer has\nalways been a region where you lose more\nthan you win. What should we do? You\nguys need to think of something quickly.\nA lord kept shouting in the regional\nchat. Lin Shia and Dugu Jaolan have such\ngood grades. Lu Xiaoing Pans Shan Yu,\nyou two are resource-based lords. Speed\nup your resource gathering. Lu Xiaoying,\nI've pushed my talent to its limit. All\nmy heroes have gone mining. Pan Shan Yu,\nI'm farming myself now, tending 10 plots\nof land by myself. Damn, how come you\nguys are so far behind those two from\nJapan? Who knows how to reply to that? I\ndug my own foot with my pickaxe.\neveryone. Just as the atmosphere grew\nincreasingly tense and panicked, Ding\nLay remembered what Lin Sha had told him\nbefore he left. \"If any unexpected\nsituation arises, your role is to keep\nthings under control.\" Lyn Shao said,\n\"We cannot allow panic to spread. Having\na pillar of stability is more important\nthan anything else, and it will also\nbenefit your lordly talent.\" You can say\nit like this. Dingle composed himself,\nlooked at the chaotic chat channel, and\nthought to himself, \"It's time for me to\nmake my appearance.\" \"Everyone, when\nfacing important matters, one should\nremain calm. I do not believe that there\nare no wise men in this era. Calm down,\neveryone.\" Getting anxious and jumping\nup and down won't solve anything. Ding\nLays literary and strangely neat words\nimmediately cooled down the irritating\nchat channel. Everyone unconsciously\nslowed down their speech and reduced\nunnecessary complaints. Feeling the\nfeedback from his talent, Dinglay nodded\nin satisfaction and said, \"Everyone,\ndon't panic. It's only the second day.\nWe haven't lost yet. We should still\nhave a solution. Let the competitors\ntell us their difficulties, and we'll\nwork together to find a solution.\" The\nwords felt, \"In the face of great\nevents, one must remain calm.\" As the\nsaying goes, there are wise men in this\nday and age. We should think of\nsolutions instead of complaining and\nblaming each other. Guanghuan, one of\nthe 10 members of the team, jumped out\nand said, \"I have extra minds, but not\nenough farmers. I'm looking to buy 20\nler talismans with a requirement of rare\nquality or higher.\" Another member,\nChinuandu, said, \"I have 10 outstanding\nleader talismans to lend you first. You\ncan pay them back later.\" Chufinga also\nstepped forward. Let's exchange ideas\nand see where there's room for\nimprovement. Julie, I only need a few\nmore resources to upgrade the mine.\nAfter upgrading, the mining speed will\nincrease by two times. Chufinga, I'll\nprovide the resources. Wongbo, I've\nalways been too embarrassed to say it,\nbut I'm good at fighting, and there are\nonly about 30 farmers here, and we\nhaven't been mining much. Chufinga, I'll\nsend troops to help you clear the land.\nGo buy some farmers right now. Lu\nYaoing, can anyone lend me a hand? I've\ndiscovered a resourcerich area with\nabundant mineral veins, but the monsters\nguarding it are incredibly strong.\nDingle/chufinga.\nLet's go together and take down the\nmonsters. Lu Xiaoing. Then how will the\nresources be distributed?\nDinglay/chufinga,\nyou are a resource type lord, so we'll\ngive you everything first. We'll discuss\nthe division and make up for what should\nbelong to us after the competition. Very\ngood, Panu. Why is nobody paying\nattention to me? I need a 100 plots of\nfarmland. Everyone, we'll give it to\nyou. In this way, through everyone's\nback and forth conversation, the L non\nregional competition team became as\nunited as a rope, working together to\nwin the competition. Look, the Lon\nregion is making a strong push, someone\nexclaimed in surprise. The resource\ngathering data of the eight lords who\nwere originally ranked third to 10th is\nrapidly increasing. 500,000, 600,000,\n700,000. Even Wong Bo, who had the\nlowest salary, immediately saw his\nsalary increase from over 100,000 to\nover 300,000. The combined improvement\nof all eight lords has a significant\nimpact on the data. As the sun set on\nthe second day, Lan region once again\novertook Sigua region. Resource\ncollection data for LN district, total\n8.59 million. Resource collection data\nfor the Shikoku region. Total 8.52\nmillion. Dinglay looked at the\ncompetition panel and nodded in\nsatisfaction once again. It feels great\nto overtake someone. Especially when\nyou've done it through your own hard\nwork. The turnaround began simply\nbecause of a sentence Lynn Sha left him\nwhen he left. In the face of great\nevents, one must remain calm. I do not\nbelieve that there are no wise men like\nthose of the past in this era. Brother\nShiao, I really made the right choice in\nfollowing you. Chapter 152. Extreme\nPulling. Lin Sha, where are you?\nHowever, Dinglays happiness did not last\nlong. Because at night, except for\nresource-based lords, the peasants of\nordinary lords are usually very tired\nand need to rest. Even if they are\nforced to work, they may eventually die\nsuddenly or get injured, which could\naffect their subsequent work. Therefore,\nat night, only Lu Xiaoing and Pans Shan\nYu were able to maintain half speed for\nresource gathering, while the other\nlords were considered to be doing well\nif they could reach 1/5 of the speed.\nMeanwhile, in the Shikoku region,\nSakura, Shikaru, and Roland even\naccelerated their resource gathering\nspeed. Baka Baka. In a small wooden\nmansion in the Shikoku district, the\nbeautiful but melancholic Sakura,\nShichiro viciously hacked at the corpse\nof the lord in front of her. He's still\nalive, and he even got up to ambush me.\nIf I weren't an S-class genius, you guys\nwould have almost succeeded. I've\nalready apologized. What more do you\nwant? Sakura Shichiro, still seething\nwith anger and panting, stared at the\ncorpse that was practically rotting\nflesh and said, still not satisfied,\n\"You incompetent lords of the great\neastern Empire should just bow down and\nlet me kill you. Do you know how hard I\nworked to win this competition, to leave\nthe Shikoku region, and to become a\nsuperstar in the entire great Japanese\nempire?\" Sakura Shichurro touched his\nbottom, his voice already trembling with\ntears. You've only lost your lives, but\nI've lost my real money. After saying\nthat, Sakura Shichiro wiped away his\ntears and muttered to himself, \"No, I\nabsolutely cannot let those stupid and\nbarbaric Chinese win the competition.\"\nHe opened another portal and went\ninside, \"I'm sorry, it's come to this\nnow.\" The sound carried from afar. Early\non the third day, the young lords of Lan\ndistrict, who had rested overnight,\nimmediately rallied and continued to\ncatch up with the progress of the four\nkingdoms district. Come on, Dingle,\nChufunga, and others encouraged each\nother and provided support and\nassistance. The lords who were watching\nalso cheered everyone on. They saw a new\ngeneration of young lords, different\nfrom those of previous years, full of\nvigor and vitality. As the sun finally\nset, Lan region caught up with Sigua\nregion once again, taking the lead by a\nvery small margin. However, the good\ntimes didn't last long. After nightfall,\nthe Four Kingdoms region once again\nsurpassed and left the Lan region\nbehind. This can't go on like this.\nDinglay dialed Lin Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s number\nagain, but there was still no answer.\nEvery lord of ours has already given it\ntheir all, and all the shortcomings have\nbeen addressed. There is almost no room\nfor improvement in the future. But why\nis the data of the Japanese lord rising\nso rapidly as if he's been injected with\nadrenaline? Brother Shiao, come back\nquickly. How can we fight without you?\nOn the fourth day, the lords of the Lan\nregion tried their best to catch up, but\nthey still couldn't catch up with the\nDonging Shikoku region by sunset. As\nnight fell, the gap widened even\nfurther. On the fifth day, the Lan\nregion was already nearly 2 million\nfewer than the Shikoku region in Japan.\nJust when everyone was feeling hopeless,\nDugu Jaolon, who had been keeping a low\nprofile, suddenly made a move. Look,\nDugu Jaan stats are rising. I don't know\nwhat method she used, but she worked\naround the clock and the resource\ncollection data skyrocketed. On the\nsixth day, Dugu Jaolan's resource\ncollection data reached 5.8 8 million,\nwhile Lin Shiao maintained a steady\ngrowth rate, reaching 5.9 million. The\ncombined data of the two of them is\nalmost the same as that of the Shikoku\nregion. With the other eight lords also\nperforming admirably, the Lnon region\nhas once again surpassed the four\nkingdoms region. Damn it, Kenzo, Dohara\nkicked the coffee table in front of him\naway. Sakura, Shichiro, and Roland are\nso useless. Even their murders and\nrobberies can't match the speed at which\nthe Lnon region accumulates resources.\nIt's infuriating. My lord, please calm\ndown. An elderly ninja across from him\ntook a sip of tea and said, \"Fum Kodoro\nhas already set out and will soon find\nLin Shia and kill him. But look at the\nstats of the other lords in the Lan\nregion. They're quite good, too.\" Kenzo\nDohra said angrily, \"What the hell is\nwrong with those damn Chinese? Aren't\nthey supposed to be the most disunited\npeople in the world? The ones who love\nto fight amongst themselves? The elderly\nninja narrowed his eyes and said, \"My\nlord also has other lords. You mean the\ntotal number of young lords in the four\nkingdoms this year is also in the tens\nof millions. There are always many ants\nwho are sent to their deaths. Let them\ndie as brilliantly as summer flowers,\nwhich can be regarded as a ray of light\nin their boring lives.\" After listening\nto the old ninja's words, Kinszo Dohara\nnodded heavily. On the sixth day, before\nthe sun had even set, the resource\ncompetition leaderboard had changed\nagain. Entire four kingdoms region is\nskyrocketing. It's not just Sakura,\nShikaru, and Roland. Even resource-based\nlords who were previously lagging behind\nare seeing their data surge. Oh my god,\nwhat on earth is going on in the Shikoku\nregion? The numbers following each\nlord's name rose rapidly. The Lnon\nregion could no longer hold on and was\nquickly left behind by the four kingdoms\nregion. This is insane. It's absolutely\ninsane. A veteran lord murmured. The\nspeed at which Lan District has gathered\nresources this year is almost among the\ntop 10 in the history of the entire\nplanet. This group of young lords is\nincredibly capable and they are very\nunited. But how come the Shikoku region\ncan still surpass us? Everyone was\nbewildered and puzzled. Even if we lose\nin the end, we must protect these young\nlords. Their abilities, resilience,\nteamwork, and mental fortitude are all\ntopnotch. One lord suggested, \"We can't\nruin the future star of our Lan region.\nHelp!\" A shrill cry rang out. Then\nsilence fell again amidst the\nastonishment of the people in Lan\ndistrict. Sorry everyone, I apologize\nfor the mistake. It was the wrong server\nthat the Lord from my four kingdoms\nregion sent the message to. Someone\nexplained in the crosserver channel.\nSeeing that it was a cry for help from\ntheir adversaries in Japan, the people\nof Long Nan district didn't take it to\nheart. As the resource accumulation data\nof the four regions continued to soar,\nwhile the data of the Lan region had\nslowed down its growth rate as night\nfell, everyone's hearts were in their\nthroats. Who else can turn the tide,\nhuh? This guy almost turned the tables.\nNecro orb successfully obtained. Lynsha\ntook out a pale white orb from the\ncorpse of the cave lord and carefully\nput it away. It took two days to\ninfiltrate the forbidden land of the\nundead and assassinate the crypt lord,\nand another two days to lure him out and\nkill him. Without the divine perspective\nand Chin Leon Yu&lt;unk&gt;s command and the\nWhite Spear soldiers extremely high\nbonus on the mountain, we simply\ncouldn't have taken the undead orb as\nsoon as we entered the official area. I\ncan only consider it after I reached\nlevel 60. We did it when we were only\nlevel 30some. Leong Yu, thank you. Lyn\nShao solemnly expressed his gratitude to\nChin Leong Yu and all the soldiers were\nfilled with awe. At this moment, the\nnotification sound of the main god\nsystems reward settlement rang out. Lynn\nShiao calculated the time, wondering how\nthe competition was progressing and then\nopened the communication interface that\nhad been blocked for several days. In an\ninstant, the flood of information made\nthe entire interface turn white. Brother\nShia, brother Sha, urgent. Lyn Shia,\ncome out quickly. My old man is about to\nbeat me to death. Please help me. Lynn\nSha, this is Dugu Jaalon. Are you there?\nChapter 153. Lynn Sha returns. Don't be\nafraid. I'm here. I didn't expect so\nmany people to be looking for me after I\nwas only missing for a few days. Even\nthe frost goddess Dugu Jaolon messaged\nme privately. Before Lin Sha could\nfinish speaking, Baoi, who was following\nbehind, secretly pinched his waist. Stop\nfooling around. Lyn Sha patted Ba's head\nand gestured for her to continue using\nthe concealment while the team rested\nand remained on guard. During a break,\nLyn Sha quickly browsed the messages\nsent to him and soon he understood the\nreason. Surprisingly, the Shikoku\ndistrict did not lose to the Lan\ndistrict as he had predicted. Instead,\nit took the lead over the Lan district\nin the resource competition. What on\nearth is going on? Dugu Jaolan has\nalready gathered resources to a level\nsimilar to mine. And so have Ding Lelay,\nFongu, Panch Shan Yu, Lu Jaoiing, and\neven a brute like Wong Bo, all of whom\nhave gathered a lot of resources. Are we\nstill lagging behind? Lyn Shiao quickly\nlooked through the chat history and\nlearned the whole story. It turns out\nthat after he left, Dinglay used his\nbackup plan to show off and successfully\nmotivated all the contestants. Everyone\nworked together and once caught up with\nthe fornation region. However, just like\nthemselves, the Shikoku region does not\nslow down its collection speed at night\nand it has overtaken them again.\nFinally, the veteran squad leader Dugu\nJalon made his move and once again\nsurpassed the Four Kingdoms region.\nHowever, at this moment, all the lords\nof the Four Kingdoms region went berserk\nas if they had rabies. At this point,\nthe Lan region could no longer catch up\nwith the Sigua region and now there was\na gap of more than 3 million. Resource\ncollection data for Lnon district total\n25.05\nmillion. Among them, he and Dugu Jaolan\naccounted for the majority. He had 13.41\nmillion and Dugu Jaolan had more than 8\nmillion. Resource collection data for\nthe Shikoku region total 28.78 million.\nSakura, Shichiro, and Roland accounted\nfor the majority with a combined total\nof over 23 million, but the resource\ncollection data of the other eight lords\nis also rapidly increasing. We've\nalready gotten our data into the top 10\nin the history of Earth. How can the\nlittle guys still surpass us? I have a\nfeeling that the younger generation\ndidn't do anything right in this\ncompetition, Lyn Sha muttered to\nhimself. If they had such a method for\nquickly gathering resources, why didn't\nthey use it in the first place? Why did\nthey give it to the two lords first and\nnot to the vassal lords? Now that\nthey're in a hurry, they're giving it to\nthe vassel lords. There must be\nsomething wrong. Lyn Sha activated his\nmost powerful brain, quickly browsing\nand analyzing the chat history. The cry\nfor help caught his eye, and Lyn Sha\ninstinctively felt something was wrong.\nAfter a moment's thought, Lynn Sha\ncontacted Saulin. saw the Lynn do this\nand this. Almost there. Lynn Shao\nstretched and sent a message to Ding Lay\nChu Funga and others who had been\nanxiously waiting for him. I have\nreturned. After thinking for a moment,\nshe mischievously sent a message to Dugu\nJalon alone. Don't be afraid. I'm here.\nAfter saying that, Lynn Sha opened a\nportal. Everyone, return. After a brief\nflash, before the enemies in the entire\nforbidden land of the dead could react,\nLyn Ziao's men had all returned to their\nofficial territory. The chat channel was\nfilled with gloom and despair. It's\nover. Only one day left. The resource\nrace is about to end. Our Lon district\nis still more than 3 million resources\nshort of the four kingdoms total\nresources. More than 3 million. Even a\nresource lord couldn't accumulate that\nmuch in 10 days. Our 10 new lords have\nperformed quite well this year, but we\nnever expected that the Japanese from\nthe four kingdoms region would be even\nstronger. The four nation region has two\nlords with S-rank talents. We also have\nLin Shiao and Dugu Jaolan, but Lyn Shao\nonly has F-level talent. Liao's\nperformance is evident to all, and he is\nalso the personal disciple of the domain\nlord. He is no worse than an S-rank\nlord. But the reality is that our Lnon\nregion is about to lose. Sigh. Things\nare unpredictable. I think we lost this\ntime. Let's not blame them. If it were\nus back then, we wouldn't have done any\nbetter. But losing is really\nfrustrating. 10 times the resources and\ncompensation will the Lon region\nagain. At this time, isn't it just a\ndifference of a little over 3 million? A\nvoice suddenly appeared in the chat\nchannel. Don't worry. Let the little\nones have their fun for a while. Let\nthem drink poison to quench their thirst\nand then our L nonan district will step\nup its efforts. I'll make those bastards\nlose both their wives and their money.\nThe chat channel was silent for a few\nseconds. Who's talking? Bragging at a\ntime like this isn't something to be\nhappy about. It's Lin Shiao. Someone\nrecognized Lin Xiao's ID. Lyn Shiao,\nyou've finally shown up. You still have\na way to improve resource collection\ndata. Brother Shiao, I've been waiting\nfor you for so long. What does Shiaoi\nmean? What does losing both wife and\narmy mean? Lynn Sha laughed heartily,\nforgetting that the dragon people spoke\na different language than him. The\nJapanese mean small life, but I forgot\nabout that too quickly. As for losing\nboth the wife and the army, it means\nmaking them lose both the game and their\ndignity. Everyone in the chat channel\nwas shocked. What? You can still win?\nAnd what about the Japanese? What\nhappened to them? How did they act so\ndisrespectfully? Lynn Sha smiled\nmysteriously. You'll all find out soon\nenough. Our 10 lords of the Lan region\nare the true victors. The Japanese are\ndestined to be nailed to the pillar of\nhistorical shame. Lyn Sha logged off and\nbriefly checked the battle rewards after\nhis long-d distanceance raid on the\nundead forbidden zone and the beheading\nof the undead hero. I have enough\nexperience to level up directly to level\n40. Fortune favors the bold. upgrade\neveryone to level 40 immediately. Then\nactivate the undead orb. The god system\nflashed with light and after a few\noperations, the necromancer orb was\nactivated. Going forward, all of\nLinhao's heroes, troops, and other units\nthat need upgrading can be upgraded\nautomatically, eliminating the need for\nLin Shiao to manually operate them.\nMoreover, Lynn Sha set up the undead orb\nto allocate 80% of the experience to all\nunits for self-upgrading while the\nremaining 20% of the experience returned\nto him for overall management. In this\nway, he can directly upgrade the newly\nrecruited green horns to the\ncorresponding level of the same type of\nsoldier. It's impossible for all the\ncurrent Moda iron guards to be level 40\nand for all newly recruited Moda iron\nguards in the barracks to start leveling\nup from level one. Moreover, he can use\nthis experience to level up himself so\nthat even if he slacks off, just\nkidding, he can still maintain the\nhighest level in the territory. What is\nthe majesty of a lord JPG? It's safe to\nsay that the undead orb is indeed one of\nthe most sought after items in the\nofficial server. Moreover, it reappears\nafter the undead forbidden zone\ndisappears, making it not so easy to\nfarm. Lynn Shia grabbed one as soon as\nhe entered, which can be considered\nincredibly lucky. I don't have much gold\nor resources, but I did get a piece of\nequipment, the scale rock helmet that\nI've been missing. Now, I finally have\nthe scale rock set, but it's a set of\nexcellent quality, so I'm not too keen\non it. I'll just use it for now. At\nleast it's better than one or two epic\narmor pieces combined. I've gained over\n10,000 more battlefield energy and now I\nhave 70,000. I should be able to use it\nfreely for a while. Enough said, you\nlittle bastards. Since you've resorted\nto underhanded tactics, don't blame me\nfor using cheat codes. Use Battlefield\nof Myriad Races energy to exchange for\nHwashia token energy. Then use the Hasha\ntoken, Emperor's Heroic Soul, to summon.\nRequire Chapter 154. A prosperous era of\nemperors and their negative effects. Use\nthe Hashia token, imperial heroic soul\nsummoning. A golden light shone down\nfrom the sky, piercing through the\nendless fog on the battlefield of all\nraces. A faint majestic chanting sound\nrose from the heavens and earth, and the\natmosphere around became solid and\nheavy, as if one were in the midst of a\nbattlefield with clashing swords and\ngalloping horses, or as if one were at\ntop a high temple in the heavens,\nlooking down upon all living beings. In\nan instant, countless imperial souls\nsurged toward Lyn Sha, used the energy\nof the battlefield of all races to\nimpose restrictions. Lynn Shao remained\ncalm and composed and stated his\nrequirements. Requirement one, an\nemperor who establishes a golden age. As\nsoon as he finished speaking, 20 or 30\nimperial spirits stepped forward,\nscrutinizing Lyn Sha with proud eyes.\nLyn Sha took a moment to check his\nenergy level, and wow, just this one\ncondition alone cost him over 20,000\nenergy. Fortunately, they didn't\ndirectly ask for General Ton Su or Zuong\nor anything like that because he\nsuspected he couldn't afford to play\nthat game. Requirement two, a leader who\ncan revitalize the nation skilled at\nliberating and developing productive\nforces. Of the 20 or 30 emperors, more\nthan a dozen remained. Only 2,000 units\nof energy were removed from the\nbattlefield of 10,000 races. It seems\nthat the emperor who revived a dynasty\nand the emperor who ushered in a golden\nage have a high degree of overlap. Lin\nSha glanced at the remaining emperors\nand suddenly added requirement three. No\nEisenjoro\nor Eisenjoro Hongley. The two Imperial\nspirits emerged unwillingly glanced at\nLin Sha and then disappeared.\nUnexpectedly, upon seeing Lin Sha\nproposed the third condition, several of\nthe remaining Imperial spirits nodded in\nappreciation. It seems there's a\nhierarchy of contempt, even among\nemperors. Lyn Sha glanced at the energy\nlevel. The battlefield energy had only\nincreased by 4,000. Spending 4,000\nbattlefield energy to eliminate two\npseudo emperors of a prosperous era was\nworth it. The conditions are set. Come\nimperial spirits, lend me your strength.\nWhoever it is under these constraints\nwill surely be a powerful emperor. As\nLyn Sha finished speaking, a tall,\nhandsome emperor with an elegant\ndemeanor and dashing appearance walked\nover. Possession complete. Lyn Sha\nopened his eyes. This was a good deal.\nEmperor Schwanzong of Tang Leongji.\nAbility borrowing level two. Degree of\nintegration low. Duration 48 hours.\nAbilities: Click to view, prosperous\nera, skilled in both literature and\nmartial arts, charming and dashing,\nimperial bearing. All troop types\ncommand a level negative. Faint\neyesight. He defeated the most powerful\nemperor in the Tang dynasty besides\nLeeir. Moreover, it's the mature version\nof the god system. No, the hasha decree\nis truly a divine artifact. Otherwise,\nif Liongji were to experience the\nEnlucian rebellion, I'd probably be in a\ncomplete mess. Lyn Shiao simply clicked\nto view Liongji's skills. The Caillouan\nera, Emperor Schwanzong of Tang created\none of the most prosperous eras in\nChinese history with outstanding\nachievements in both civil\nadministration and military affairs.\nMartial arts increases the loyalty of\nall generals under your command by 20%.\nincreases all attributes by 20% and\nreduces the difficulty of recruiting\nforeign troops by 100%. Civilization\nincreases the mining efficiency of all\nmineral veins by 300%. Increases the\nyield of all agricultural resources by\n300%.\nIncreases the output of all territory\nbuildings by 300%. Allied nations and\nvassal states have also benefited\ngreatly from the prosperity of the Tang\ndynasty. Therefore, the host designated\nallies will have their mining efficiency\nincreased by 200% for all mineral\nresources, agricultural production\nincreased by 200% and territorial\nbuilding production increased by 200%.\nNo wonder Leongji was able to quickly\nrestore order to the Tang dynasty after\nthe turbulent decades following Wuatian,\ntransforming it from poverty and\ndestitution into the prosperous\nCaillouan era, which was even stronger\nthan the Jinguan era of his\ngreatgrandfather Lee Shiman, attracting\nall nations to pay tribute. With just\nthis one skill, Lin Sha could crush and\nsurpass the fornation region. As for the\nattributes of well-rounded in both\nliterary and martial arts, charming and\ndashing, imperialbearing and all type\ntroop commander level, there was nothing\ninteresting about them. So Lin Shiao\njust glanced at them briefly. Being both\nscholarly and marshall is simply a\nmatter of adding some points to the four\nmain attributes, health and lifespan,\nespecially stamina and way strength.\nHowever, I don't seem to need it right\nnow. He is dashing and charming, more\nattractive to the opposite sex,\nappealing to all ages, and devoted to\nall the women he falls in love with. A\nregal bearing enhances one's charm,\nmaking it easier for the opposite sex to\nfall in love with them. Huh. Lyn Shao\nsuddenly realized that Leongji had so\nmany skills, two of which were related\nto love and romance. No wonder he was so\nentangled with Yangu Feay. Negative,\nfainting eyesight. After reaching a\ncertain age, Liongji would become\narrogant, extravagant, and neglect state\naffairs. Anyway, the one possessing me\nnow is the young and vigorous Emperor\nSchwanzong of Tang. So, it doesn't\nmatter. Lyn Sha ignored this negative\nskill. After entering the official zone,\nor rather after I came into contact with\nthe mythic cards, the level of Emperor's\nSoul Fusion has reached the low level\nand the duration has also reached 48\nhours. The attributes that Emperor\nSchwanzong of Tang has given me have now\nreached an average of 600 points. Lyn\nSha closed the character attribute panel\nand nodded in satisfaction. When I\nopened the competition interface again,\nmy resource collection quantity indeed\nskyrocketed like an explosion. Resource\ncollection data for Lnon District. Lin\nSha 13.51 million 13.52\nmillion 13.55\nmillion 13.6 6 million. People in the\nLan district also quickly noticed Lin\nXiao's unusual behavior. Oh my god,\nlook. Lyn Xiao's stats are skyrocketing.\n14 million 14.1 million. Every time I\nblink, Lyn Xiao's resource collection\ndata increases by tens of thousands.\nThis is simply unbelievable. The\nexclamations drew a crowd and soon\nhundreds of thousands of people\nfollowing the competition flooded the\nchat channel. Lynn Shiao truly lives up\nto his reputation as a genius personally\ntaught by the domain lord. With him\naround, we still have hope. Brother\nShia, awesome. In just over 10 minutes,\nLynn Shia narrowed the gap of more than\n3 million in Lan district to more than 2\nmillion. At this rate, the Shikoku\nregion will soon be caught up with and\nsurpassed. At this moment, Lynn Shiao,\nwho was sitting in the Lord&lt;unk&gt;'s\nmansion, noticed that the data of the\nfour kingdoms region had also begun to\nsurge. Is he truly encouragable? By\ndoing this for a single match, aren't\nyou digging your own grave?\" Lyn Sha\nclosed his eyes, used his lord level\nauthority to locate the spy he had sent\nout, and then sensed the spies\nperspective. Just as I expected, just as\nI thought. Through his observations of\nthe undercover agents, Lynn Shia learned\nthe truth. To win the resource race,\nthey actually did such a thing to their\nown people. How perverted and shameless.\nBut I like it. On the competition\ninterface, Lyn Sha had just narrowed the\ngap to around 1 million. But the four\nkingdoms region started to speed up\nagain. Instead, Lyn Sha asked the\nmonsters in Calabash Valley to rest for\nhalf a night. Let them kill for another\nnight. The more the better. He Anyway,\nthey were all lowly lords who died. So,\nlet's give the Japanese some vague hope.\nIt's time to go find my old squad\nleader, Dugu Jaolon, my little brother,\nDinglay, and my good brother Fongo, and\nlet them also enjoy the 200% bonus.\nThen, we&lt;unk&gt;ll have victory in our\ngrasp. Just then, Ba walked in. My lord,\nthis humble servant. Lyn Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s gaze\nfroze for a moment. My beloved\nconcubine, come to me quickly. For some\nreason, Bai, who is already stunningly\nbeautiful, seemed different to him\ntoday. He just felt if I cannot embrace\nmy beloved at this moment, I will feel a\ndeep sense of loss. He only regretted\nthat he could not transform into a pair\nof love birds in heaven with Ba or\nbecome intertwined branches on earth. At\nthis moment, I don't want to care about\nanything else. All I want is to have a\ndeep emotional exchange with Baoi. Baoi\nlooked up in surprise and found that Lin\nShiao was different from before. He was\nalready a handsome man. But at this\nmoment, he was more mysterious and more\nalluring. Yes, men can also be described\nas alluring. It also possesses an\nalluring imperial aura. They say power\nis the best aphrodesiac. Ba's breathing\nbecame rapid. Her pretty face flushed\nred and she walked cautiously with small\nlabored steps. Lyn Sha didn't care about\nanything else. He stroed over and picked\nup Ba in his arms. With a gentle\nreminder, the two removed their\nunnecessary items. Chapter 155 must not\nbe allowed to live designated\nprivileges. Nightfalls inside the Lord's\nmansion in the Shikoku district. Kenzo\nDohara's angry voice echoed through the\nair. Baka bastard. The lead we've worked\nso hard to build is now only a little\nover a million. Will we be overtaken\ntomorrow? Sakura, Shikaru, and Roland,\nand your vassel lords, are you even\ncapable? Of the more than 10 million\nyoung lords in my four kingdoms region,\nseveral thousand have been slaughtered\nby you. I mobilized my connections every\nday to clean up the mess, and this is\nthe result you left me. Hurry up and\nstep up your game. take advantage of the\nnight and quickly build up a bigger\nlead. Baka, if we lose this time, even\nkilling you all wouldn't be enough to\ncompensate. I've already lost thousands\nof lords, and if this continues, I won't\nbe able to protect you all. Hey, came\nthe distinctive bowing and scraping of\nthe Japanese from the other end, and\nKinszo Dohura's anger gradually\nsubsided. After turning off the\ncommunication, he sat down on the tatami\nmat with his knees bent, his expression\nsolemn. We almost got turned around and\nit was all caused by that guy named Lynn\nSha. Thank goodness. Thank goodness his\nspeed suddenly slowed down and he didn't\nstart operating at night. I can somewhat\nempathize with Pu Dawei s concerns about\nthis son. It's unbelievable that one\nperson alone has the ability to\ninfluence and change the entire\nsituation. This child must not be\nallowed to live. Kenzo Dohara&lt;unk&gt;'s\nsmall round eyes flashed with a sharp\nlight as he dialed the old ninja's\ncommunication again. Has Lyn Xiao's\nlocation still not been found? Fumako\nhas discovered something unusual in a\nforbidden zone for the undead. Rest\nassured, my lord, Fumodoro is one of my\nfour great ninjas. Killing Lin Shia, a\nlevel 30 novice lord, is a piece of\ncake. After an unknown amount of time,\nBa, feeling as if she had been pulled\nout of the water, finally came to her\nsenses and gently leaned against her\nhusband's strong body. My lord, okay,\njust call me husband. Lyn Shao gently\nembraced the beauty in his arms and\nsaid, \"There are no outsiders here, so\nyou can relax. We can be like any other\ncouple.\" \"My husband,\" Baoi blushed\nshily, her eyes welling up with tears of\nemotion. Lyn Xiao&lt;unk&gt;so willingness to\nlet her call him husband is a sign of\nhis approval of her. My husband is\ndifferent today. That was Emperor\nSchwanzong of Tang, that eccentric\nemperor. His both literary and marshall\ntalents skill had a jumbled mess of\nthings added to it, which really opened\nLyn Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s eyes. He Lyn Shao\nstretched and asked, \"What brings you\nhere?\" \"I was originally here to serve\nthe Lord during his bath and dressing,\"\nBaoi said shily. \"But now it's like\nthis.\" Haha, things are fine as they are\nnow. It's not too late to take a bath\nnow. Lyn Sha laughed and carried Ba to\nthe bathtub. The water's all cold. Ba\nsaid, \"Please let me heat up some warm\nwater.\" \"No way,\" Lyn Sha said\ndecisively. \"How can I let you work so\nhard? Besides, what if someone sees us?\"\nLyn Sha thought for a moment, then\nsummoned two flower fairies in his mind\nand asked them to bring in fresh hot\nwater. Two strange and beautiful fairies\nwith translucent wings flew in. As soon\nas they entered, they saw a handsome man\nfaintly visible behind the screen and a\nbeautiful woman he was embracing. The\nwoman leaned on the man's shoulder, her\nlong black hair cascading down to the\nground, partially obscuring her shapely\nfigure. The flower fairy was momentarily\nstunned. Hearing the sound of flapping\nwings, the man slowly turned his head\nand spoke softly in a nasal tone. Um uh\nYao Yao deserves to die, the two flower\nfairies quickly apologized. Their hearts\nwere pounding, and they dared not look\naround anymore. They could only quickly\nchange the hot water and fly away,\nclosing the door behind them. \"Ph, I was\nso nervous,\" a flower fairy exclaimed,\npatting her chest. The Lord's aura is\nbecoming more and more terrifying, just\nlike a real emperor. I couldn't help but\nwant to kneel down and crawl over. Stop.\nWhat are you saying? It's outrageous.\nWhat you're saying is perfectly normal.\nWhat are you two doing? The flower fairy\nsquad leader came to the two of them and\nscolded them. Get to work. After the two\nleft, the flower fairy squad leader\nshook his head and muttered to himself,\n\"How could you possibly covet the Lord,\nMiss Ba? General Chin Leong Yu, Princess\nAndrea the Succubus, Sherry the blood\nwitch, and I even think that Miss Dugu,\nthe Lord's classmate, is interested in\nhim. Even I, Yao, Yao, dare not dream\nthat the Lord will one day make Yao Yao.\nUm, I'm drooling. Lyn Shiao and Bao\nentered the bathtub. The warm waters\nsoaked their skin, making him close his\neyes in comfort. By the way, Ba, you\nshould recruit some songstresses. Lynn\nSha stretched and yawned, then put his\narm around the beauty in his arms. The\nsongstresses were Bao's exclusive troop\ntype, but Lyn Sha had never recruited\nthem, and Baoi had never mentioned them.\nH Does my husband think I haven't served\nyou well? No, no, no. What I mean is,\nyou're my person. How can you do these\ntrivial things every day? You should\nalso have the demeanor of a princess.\nLet the servants do these chores. And\nthe flower fairies are too lively and\nunruly. They wouldn't be good\nwaitresses. You could recruit some\nsongstresses who could give you leg\nmassages, back rubs, and foot washes and\nsing and dance during holidays. No, rap.\nI mean sing and dance to make everyone\nhappy. My lord, I will recruit some\nsinging girls. But your words frightened\nBa a little. Fear. Lynsha suddenly woke\nup. Holy crap. What am I doing?\nContinuing to play music and dance. It\nturns out that the negative effects of\nEmperor Schwanzong of Tang were taking\nhold. Lin Shao broke out in a cold\nsweat. Then realized, \"Baoi, you are\ntruly my wise and virtuous wife. From\nnow on, if anyone says you are a fim\nfatal who brings ruin to the country,\nI'll fight them to the death.\" Baosi\nleaned happily into Linia's arms. With\nmy husband's words, I can die without\nregrets. But husband, why is your\nbreathing so rapid again? Haha, of\ncourse. Then a thousand miles of orioles\nsing amidst the green and red wine flags\nflutter in the wind of wateride villages\nand mountain towns. The flower fairy\nsquad leader, who was eavesdropping\noutside, shed tears of envy from the\ncorner of his mouth. After some time,\nLyn Sha arrived at the war hall. It's\nonly 900 p.m. now, and the competition\nlords of the Lan region should still be\nawake at this time. Dinglay, you did a\ngreat job this time. Lyn Sha first went\nto his vassel lord and subordinate and\nassigned the caillouan prosperity\nspecial effect to Dinglay. Dinglays\ncurrent mining efficiency for all\nmineral veins is increased by 200%. The\nyield of all agricultural resources is\nincreased by 200%. The output of all\nterritory buildings is increased by\n200%. If I eat meat, you'll have soup.\nLynn Shiao encouraged him. Be my good\nlittle brother and let's chase the\nspirit of glory together. Then they\nfound Fongu. Good lad, you finally\narrived. Chufinga's red hair drooped a\nlittle. There's still a gap of about a\nmillion and there&lt;unk&gt;'s only one day\nleft. How can we catch up? And why has\nyour speed slowed down again? Lynn Shia\nsmiled mysteriously. With me here, you\ncan rest assured. Let me give you a\ntaste of what it's like to be the center\nof attention. You have to keep this a\nsecret. Lynn Shiao designated the\nprosperous era of Caillouan special\neffects for Chufinga. Next up should be\nmy good class monitor, right? Lyn Sha\nfelt an urgency as he dialed Dugu\nJaolan's number. On the other side, Dugu\nJaolon, dressed in a light purple robe\nand holding a sword in her hand, looked\nlike a fairy descended from heaven. Her\nlong hair cascaded down. Her purple robe\nwas as beautiful as a flower, and her\nlong sword was as white as snow. She was\nindescribably beautiful, elegant, noble,\nand otherworldly. With the help of\nEmperor Schwanzong of Tang, Lin Sha\nblurted out unconsciously. My beloved\nconcubine, \"Don't be afraid. I'm here.\"\nDugu Jaalon was struck dumb, and the\nsword in his hand clattered to the\nground. Her eyes widened in disbelief,\nher usual, elegant and aloof demeanor\ncompletely gone. How dare you? A voice\ncame from beside Dugu Jaon. Chapter 156.\nDialogue with Lord Dugu. Far ahead. Lyn\nSha was taken aback. A woman who looked\nseven or eight parts similar to Dugu\nJaolon, but was more mature and aloof,\ndressed in a gorgeous gown and wearing a\nsolemn headdress, appeared on the\ncommunication interface. Little ant. Lin\nSha murmured unconsciously. Who are you\ncalling auntie? Across from her, Dugu\nNanuang&lt;unk&gt;s eyebrows furrowed and\nwaves of murderous intent emanated from\nher through the internet cable. Lin\nShiao shivered and quickly straightened\nhis posture, bowing his head and saying,\n\"Lord of the domain.\" Dugu Nanuang\nsnorted coldly, glanced at Dugu Jaon,\nand slowly said, \"I didn't expect Ganon\nto tell you about my relationship with\nher. It seems you hold a high place in\nGowan's heart. In front of her aunt, who\nsurpassed her in status, aura,\nexperience, and looks, Dugu Jaolan lost\nher aloof goddess demeanor and instead\nlooked pitifully at the floor like a\ngirl who had made a mistake. Lyn Sha\nthought to himself with a smug smile.\nServes you right for being so\nmischievous and playing tricks on me all\nday long. Dugu Nanuang continued, Lyn\nSha, I came to find Jaolon to learn\nabout your situation. It's just that you\ncalled. Looks like I don't need to come\nto see you separately anymore. Lynn\nShiao said sincerely. Please give your\ninstructions, Lord Domain Master. Dug\nNanuang said coldly. Lyn Sha, confirm\nthat you are not with anyone and are in\nan absolutely safe and confidential\nplace. Lyn Sha looked around and said,\n\"I have cleared out the warh hall. No\none can enter without my permission.\"\nDugun Nanuang nodded. Very good. What I\nam about to say may very well concern\nyour life or death. Lynn Shiao, aren't\nyou wondering why I suddenly appear and\ndeclare that you are my last disciple\nwhen we've never met before and you even\nrefused Chu Yusi's offer to recruit you?\nLyn Sha looked directly at Dugu Nanuang\nand said frankly, \"Because the domain\nlord wanted to protect me. He gave me a\nlegitimate identity with strength that\nwas beyond reason. Why should I help\nyou? Because the domain lord wants me to\nbecome a powerful ranger lord of dragon\nsia and fight for dragon sa. Will you\nfight for Lia meeting? Then why did you\nreject Chu Yusi back then? Its wings are\nnot yet fully grown and it has too many\nsecrets. Dugu Nanuang narrowed her eyes,\na playful look on her face. Oh, so\nyou've grown powerful now. In the\nofficial area, the sea is wide enough\nfor fish to leap and the sky is high\nenough for birds to fly. So, you don't\nhave many secrets left. There are still\nmany secrets, but I am grateful to the\ndomain lord for his kindness in covering\nthem up for me. Dug Nanuang didn't\nspeak. She just kept staring at Lyn\nShao. Lyn Sha neither dodged nor avoided\nDugu Nanuang&lt;unk&gt;s scrutinizing gaze.\nDugu Jaon, standing to the side, frowned\nslightly as if he had gleaned something\nfrom their conversation and was deep in\nthought. Very good, Lyn Shao. Dugu\nNanuang said slowly. Your mind is more\nfirm and mature than I imagined. It\nseems that my decision was not wrong.\nHowever, I also want to remind you that\nmy investment in and protection of you\nis entirely based on your ability to\ncontribute to Lshia. Regardless of\nwhether you have an ambiguous or unclear\nrelationship with the demon race, Duga\nNanchuangs tone turns somber. It's still\nabout ancient demons. As long as you can\nbecome an invincible blade for my Lung\nShia. Lyn Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s pupils suddenly\ncontracted. The Dugu family indeed knew\nsomething about him and the ancient\ndemons. Can you really fight for Lia?\nDugu Nanuang asked slowly, almost in a\ndreamlike tone. Lin Shiao remained\nsilent for a full 5 seconds. Although I\ncame into this world, I have never\nforgotten my identity as a Chinese\nperson. Because of his Chinese identity,\nhe obtained the Chinese token and\nawakened an SSS level talent. They felt\nan instant connection with the Chinese\nheroes and soldiers from this other\nworld. The world of Lshia is on the\nverge of collapse. The fate of the\nancient demons also tells the tragic\nstory of Chinese civilization. He\noriginally only wanted to live a\ncarefree life in another world, but by a\ntwist of fate, he has become deeply\nbound to the ancient demons of China.\nWhether by choice or by force, he was\nalready on the blacklist of all traitors\nand had no choice but to fight to the\ndeath for his own sake and for the fate\nof the ancient demons. Lord Dugu, there\nis something I must clarify. Lyn Shao\nsaid slowly. I will not become anyone's\nweapon. Dugu Nanu&lt;unk&gt;s expression\nremained unchanged, but her killing\nintent had already hardened. I really\nadmire these masters. How did their\nkilling intent travel through the\ninternet? Lyn Sha thought to himself,\nbut still calmly replied. But I can\nassure you, everything I've done is for\nLang Shia, for the people of Lang Shia,\nand for this country to become strong\nagain. It's&lt;unk&gt; also for the sake of\nChina. As soon as the words were\nuttered, Dugu Nanuang narrowed her eyes\nslightly again, while Dugu Xaolan&lt;unk&gt;s\neyes widened, and she lost her composure\nonce more. Okay, I've got it. After\nthat, there were no torches and I became\nthe only light. Without wasting words,\nDugan Nanuang said directly, \"You can\nstill use my name.\" Having said that,\nshe glanced indifferently at Dugu Jaon,\nthen looked back at Lin Sha and slowly\nsaid, \"Besides me and Gan, I hope you\nwill never say those two words in front\nof anyone else. This is for your own\ngood.\" Dugu Nanuang is gone, leaving\nbehind only Dugu Jaolan, who has shed\nher aloof exterior. Hey, class monitor.\nBefore Lin Sha could finish speaking,\nDugu Jaolan abruptly shut down the\ncommunication, leaving Lin Shiao\nscratching his head awkwardly. The\nmorning of the final day of the resource\nrace. Look, Lan region has caught up,\nand the gap with the four kingdoms\nregion is less than 100,000. My god, how\ndid they do that? It's Dugu, Jaolon,\nDinglay, and Shufinga. Their combined\nresource data has almost doubled. What?\nThat's amazing. Amidst the murmurss,\nLynn Sha awoke. It's time to give the\nShikoku region a desperate and\nundignified death. Surely, notify all\nthe monsters in the valley. Everyone\nmust go into battle. No rest allowed.\nGather resources for the entire day.\nsoldin inform all farmers to put aside\ntheir other work and devote themselves\nentirely to production. With Lin Xiao's\narrangement, his accumulated resource\ndata skyrocketed. The three shift system\nwas changed to a single shift system and\nthe output increased by three times.\nCaillouan prosperity 3x bonus. May peace\nand prosperity last forever plus five\ntimes the amount. Lynhiao's resource\ncollection data has reached 15 million\n15.5 million 16 million. The data\nincreases every time you blink. The\ntotal data for the L nan region\nimmediately surpassed that of the four\nmajor regions. We're going to win. We're\ngoing to win. The crowd began to cheer.\nLin Shiao, Dugu, Ding Lay, and all the\nyoung lords participating in the\ncompetition. Good luck. You must win. If\nyou win, I'll treat you to dinner. After\nwitnessing Lyn Xiao's prowess, the data\nfrom the four regions briefly struggled\nbut ultimately could not catch up with\nLin Xiao's terrifying acceleration.\nFinally, the tense final day of the\ncompetition came to an end and\neverything was settled. Resource\nShao 46.75\nmillion, Dugu Jaolan 13 million, Dinglay\n5.31 million, Chufinga 5.25 25 million\ntotal for Lnon district 82.31\nmillion resource collection data for the\nShikoku region Sakura Shichiro 22.52\nmillion Roland 21.88 88 million total in\nthe Shikoku region 46.7 million Lan\nDistrict 1 far ahead from the four\nregions is not even as much as the data\nfrom Lin Shao alone. Lyn Xiao's\ncollection of over 46 million resource\ndata points was mostly obtained on the\nlast day. Lyn Xiao's boast that he could\ndefeat 10 lords from the four kingdoms\nall by himself actually came true. Lynn\nShiao is terrifyingly powerful. Just as\nthe entire Lan region was celebrating,\nan exasperated voice rang out in the\ncross region channel. Cheating. You must\nbe cheating. Lyn Shia, confess. Did you\ncollude with the demons to kill their\nlords who were sent to their deaths to\nobtain resources? Chapter 157. The truth\nrevealed, rewards received. Lyn Sha,\nconfess. Did you collude with the demons\nto kill their lords who were sent to\ntheir deaths to obtain resources? The\nchat channel was silent for a few\nseconds, then immediately launched a\nfierce counterattack. What nonsense are\nyou spouting? Every one of our lords has\nachieved real results and even broken\nhistorical records. You guys can't\nhandle losing, so don't play.\nUnfortunately, it's too late to back out\nnow. We've already won the bet witnessed\nby the god system. The voice on the\nother end continued to haunt them. Chui,\ncome out here and explain yourself\nclearly. Why did the data for your lords\nsuddenly increase at the end? If you\ndon't explain yourself clearly, my\ncountry Japan will lodge a formal\nprotest with your Lan district, and you\nwill bear all the consequences. Since\nthe competition and betting began,\ncalmly said, \"All the participating\nlords in my lung non region have used\nfair and just methods, and there has\nbeen no cheating. This has been\nrecognized by the god system. You Kenzo\nDohura persisted. Even the competition\nmonitored by the god system has bugs.\"\n\"Oh, what kind of bug? How come I didn't\nknow about it?\" Chu yusi on the other\nend became interested. Does your country\nknow about this bug? Kenzo Dohura didn't\nanswer but just kept shouting, \"No, you\nhave to explain why your results were\nable to surpass ours. Especially Lynn\nShiao. His results are outrageous. I\nhave reason to believe that he must be\ncolluding with the demons. I regret that\nI cannot comply.\" \"Then you have indeed\ncolluded with the common enemy of Earth,\nand your intentions are despicable.\"\nKenzo Dohur said, \"Our Japan will\ncertainly not let you get away with\nthis. Your accusations are completely\nunfounded. Damn it, you fat pig. Always\nbabbling on and on. What's your name? A\nshrill voice rang out, startling\neveryone in the chat channel. In front\nof people from two different countries\nand two different regions across a cross\nregional channel. He publicly referred\nto the high-ranking official, Ambassador\nDoyuku Kenji, as a dead fat pig. Baka\nTufun immediately flew into a rage. Lyn\nSha, how dare you be so rude to me?\nDon't you know anything about basic\nmanners? The one who cursed was Lyn Sha.\nCan't accept defeat, huh? You fat, ugly\nduckling. Aren't you just trying to\nsmear the demons on me again and then\ntry to reig on your promise? You've\nalready lost all shame, and you won't\neven let me scold you. Unfortunately,\neven if you want to reig, it's useless.\nWith the contract witnessed by the god\nsystem, the god system will\nautomatically take the resources from\nyou and give them to us. Kenzo Dohurra\nwas furious. I'll give it to you. Do you\ndare to take it? You must have cheated\nand colluded with the demons to achieve\nyour current results. If you do not\nreturn all my resources, my Shikoku\nregion will definitely report to Prime\nMinister Tojo Hideki of Japan and launch\na just war against your dragon summers\ncollusion with the demon race. The\nthreat of war is spoken so openly and\nblatantly. This gives a glimpse into the\ndoineering and shameless nature of the\nJapanese. What? Scared? If you're\nscared, apologize to us right now and\ntake on 10 times the resources before\nhanding Lin Shiao over to us. Seeing the\nchat channel quiet, Kinszo Doyu was\nsmug. Fine, go ahead and report it.\nLet's see if Tojo Hideki Chi will chop\nyou up, you fat pig who slaughtered his\nown kind before he even starts the war.\nWhat did you say? You thought you had\nthe upper hand just now. That's because\nI was uploading a video. Lyn Sha shouted\nloudly. Everyone, please look. Lyn Sha\nposted the videos one by one to the\ncross regional chat channel. A handsome\nman in a kimono walked out of the portal\nholding a samurai sword and coldly and\nmercilessly stabbed the astonished young\nlord in front of him. A blonde man who\nlooked like a woman accompanied by\nfierce Japanese samurai frantically\nchased and slashed at the fleeing people\nand then set the lord's mansion ablaze.\nThere were also lords with ferocious\nfaces who not satisfied with killing the\nlord set their sights on the lord's\nfemale heroes and female soldiers raping\nthem in public. One, two, 10 faces kept\nappearing in the videos, killing lords\none after another, listening to the\nhowls with expressionless faces. And\nthen there was their standard bowing and\napology after they killed someone. Sorry\nfor the trouble. How ironic. the two who\nappeared most frequently and also the\nfirst ones to appear. Sakura Shichiro, a\nhandsome man in a kimono, and Roland, a\nblond-haired host. They and indeed all\nthe Japanese lords in this competition\nwere actually slaughtering their own\nkind. Those unsuspecting novice Japanese\nlords. You, you, where did you get this\nvideo from? This is slander, defamation,\nand falsehood. Kenzo Dohura stammered\nincoherently. Lyn Sha, you're framing\nme. As we all know, videos cannot be\nphotoshopped. So, the video is real. Lyn\nSha made a joke in a relaxed manner.\nWhat? What photoshop? Whether it's true\nor false, surely the lords of Japan have\nrelatives and friends among these\ndeceased. Why don't they check if the\npeople they know are still alive? Baka,\nhow did you know that? You don't need to\nknow how I know. Lyn Shao said, \"You\nkeep saying there's a bug in the all\nraces competition because you used that\nbug yourself. You asked us in the Lon\nregion if there's a bug where killing\ndemons causes a bug because you're\nguilty and you're killing your own\nkind.\" \"Sorry, you fatso\",\" Lyn Sha said\ncalmly. \"Not only have we not colluded\nwith the demons, but every resource we\ncollect has been obtained cleanly.\" Lyn\nShao raised his voice and said, \"But\nyou, Kenzo, Doyu, you used your superior\nauthority to leak a large amount of\ninformation about young lords to the\nlords participating in the competition.\"\nSakura, Shichiro, Roland, and others can\nobtain precise coordinates to travel\ndirectly to the location of the young\nlord and carry out the massacre. The\nconsequences of massacring one's own\nkind and the punishment from the main\ngod system have also been erased by you.\nas the superior using your authority.\nResources obtained by killing fellow\nclan lords are also counted in the\ncompetition which is why Sakura Shichiro\nand others have seen their scores sore.\nKenzo Dohara, you really will stop at\nnothing to achieve your goals. Thousands\nupon thousands of your people have been\nsold out and killed by you. Lyn Sha\ndeliberately adopted a Japanese tone and\nsaid being betrayed by the superior you\ntrusted most and suddenly killed by your\nidol. If I were Japanese, I would\nprobably feel heartbroken too, right? My\nlords of Japan, it is a pity that I am a\ndragon person and cannot help you. I'm\nso sorry to have been born a Dragia\nperson. You decide for yourselves how to\ntreat your superior, your ambassador,\nKenzo Doyu. No, Baka, let me go. I am\nthe ambassador. You have no right to\ntreat me like this. Kenzo Dohare's\nshouts abruptly stopped and no one spoke\nin the Cross region chat channel\nanymore. Lyn Shia let out a long sigh\nand left the Cross Region channel. Just\nthen, the competition rewards from the\nGod system arrived in my account. Ding.\nThe resource gathering competition\nbetween Lan region and the four kingdoms\nregion has ended. The winning Lan region\nhas received its winning stake as\nagreed. The main god system has directly\ncollected the corresponding bets from\nthe four kingdoms and all resources have\nbeen deducted equally from all lords in\nthe four kingdoms. The loneon region\nwill receive the following resources. A\ntotal of 100 million stone or 100\nmillion timber, 40 million refined iron,\n40 million refined copper, 8 million\ngold coins, and 10 billion gold coins.\nAll resources will be placed under the\nunified management of the LN region\ncity, Lord's Mansion. Lung Nan region\nreceives an extra bet. The Four Kingdoms\nregion's annual luck charm has been\nactivated and is in effect. All players\nin the LN region, excluding beginners,\nwill receive a 10-year increase in\nlifespan, a 10% increase in health, and\na 10% increase in luck. The overall\nresource production of the Lung Nan\nregion will increase by 10%. And the\narea of the Lan region will expand by\n10%. The announcement from the main god\nsystem slowly reached everyone's ears.\nBut this time, after learning how cruel\nthe Japanese had been in order to win,\nthe people of Lan District didn't feel\nmuch joy or excitement. Lyn Sha nodded.\nThrough this incident, the people of Lan\nDistrict had realized that the Japanese\nwere not good people and had become more\naware of their situation. Lynn Shiao\ncasually switched back to the Lan region\nchannel, intending to plan his next move\nwithin his territory. Looking up, I saw\na screen full of neatly arranged\nmessages. Lyn Sha, thank you. Lyn Sha,\nthank you. Chapter 158. New hero. I want\nJugalong. Inside the Lord's Manor, Lyn\nShao silently waited for the upgrade of\nhis four bases to be completed. The\nrules in the official area are more\ncomplicated. You need to be level 40 to\nupgrade to Town Hall 4 and level 50 to\nupgrade to Town Hall 5. So, for Town\nHall 10 bases, the lord needs to be\nlevel 100 to upgrade. A level 100\nofficial lord can already participate in\nthe competition for the official area's\nmarshall prowess ranking. Black Flame's\nelder brother, Wong Su, is level 100 and\njust ranked 100th on the Lord ranking,\nbut he only has 10 books and 10 heroes.\nThat's why being number one in the\nnewbie zone is so important because it\nmeans getting an extra hero slot. And I\nI actually have two more hero slots.\nAfter sighing, Lynn Shiao smiled\nfaintly. I doubt many people would have\nthought that I would have completed four\nbooks in just 10 days after entering the\nofficial zone. After entering the\nofficial area, Lin Sha went to the\nundead forbidden zone, killed the heroic\ncrypt lord inside, and gained a huge\namount of experience. After returning to\nhis territory and completing the\nresource competition, Lyn Shao reached\nlevel 40 and began leveling up his base.\nToday marks the completion of all four\nbooks. Then, Lyn Sha can recruit his\nsixth hero. So far, Lin Sha has five\nheroes. Pay Min, the great sword saint\nof the Tang Dynasty, is a powerful\none-on-one hero and the master of\nwandering knights. Baoi, the peerless\nenchantress, is a mythical heroine, a\nstunning beauty, and can even influence\nthe fate of lords and nations. Marquez\nChin Leang Yu is the queen of the\nmountains, a valiant and beautiful\nfemale general who is also a married\nwoman. Huubing, also known as Finlang\nJaku, was a cavalry general, a military\ngenius, and an unparalleled warrior.\nMaster blacksmith O Yzi, a special hero,\nand one of the patriarchs of\nblacksmiths, has forged countless famous\nswords. Although he has no combat\nability with his addition, Lin Shiao has\nupgraded the equipment and weapons of\nall the MO Dao iron guards, divine arm\narchers, white pole spearmen, and Guan\nNing iron cavalry, raising the combat\npower of his own Chinese troops to a new\nlevel. Of course, Lyn Xiao's troops are\nnow quite complete. Pay has recruited a\nteam of 10 wandering knights. Each of\nthe knights is more capable than the\niron guards of the same level and is a\nmaster of one-on-one combat. Ba also\nrecruited several songstresses, all of\nwhom were stunning beauties. However,\nLynn Sha used them as servants in the\nLord's mansion, and they were\nresponsible for household chores.\nHitsubing has recruited 100 elite\ncavalrymen. These are Hoitubing's\nexclusive Chinese troops, and they are\nof the gold legendary level. They are\npowerful and even stronger than the Guan\nNing iron cavalry in close combat. On O\nY's side, he recruited a number of\nblacksmiths to assist him, which could\nquickly advance the upgrading of\nLinhao's army's equipment. In short, Lyn\nShao is currently in a period of rapid\ngrowth. All heroes and units obeyed\ntheir own commands, and there were no\ninternal troubles. The area of the\nofficial district is large enough that\nit will not encounter other lords and\nthere will be no external threats. Lyn\nShia already has several hundred golden\nlegend farmers and over 200 lively\nflower fairies in his workforce. The\nhardworking wild monsters throughout the\ncalabash valley and the spiritual fields\nand ponds of the golden legend farmers.\nLyn Sha could continuously recruit all\nthe units he could. There's a huge\namount of equipment, including excellent\nand rare weapons and armor, as well as\nmany epic and legendary items. However,\nthere haven't been any new epic or\nlegendary items available in the\nofficial servers yet. Thanks to previous\naccumulation and Leelong skills, the\ngold coins were more than enough to\nlast. As for safety, with Bao se's\namplified skill, concealment, and Lin\nXiao's occasional use of the celestial\nperspective to check the surrounding\nenvironment, Lin Sha has not yet\ndiscovered anything unusual. Last time,\nfrom the perspective of the god of\nheaven, it seems that someone has\nentered the forbidden zone of the undead\nagain. But this person did not leave any\nobvious traces. He must be a master. I\nhope it's not aimed at me. Lyn Shaoed.\nMy territory is now only a small to\nmedium-sized territory, but I'm already\nfinding it difficult to manage. This\ntime, let's recruit a civil official\ntype hero with strong domestic\nadministration skills. Lynn Shiao\nglanced at Baoi, who was quietly keeping\nhim company while he waited, and\nsilently thought to himself, \"Drunk, I\nlie on the lap of a beauty. Awake, I\nwield power over the world. My focus\nshould be on conquering and improving\nmyself. It's better to have someone\nmanage the affairs of the territory.\nThis person should ideally be able to\ncommand respect so that my subordinates\nwill be willing to listen to him. Of\ncourse, loyalty is also necessary. In\nChinese history, many powerful civil\nofficials have directly sidelined the\nemperor and even held the power to\ndepose and install emperors,\nmanipulating the emperor at will.\nLoyalty is of course the most important\nthing. He he I can't let my subordinates\nkick me out of office. Thinking about it\nthis way, there is one person who can\nmeet my conditions very well, but I\ndon't know if the Hashiao order has\nenough energy. Lost in thought, the four\nbooks were upgraded. The announcement\nthroughout the Lon region. But in a\nregion with a population of hundreds of\nmillions and an area of tens of millions\nof square kilm, announcements like\nupgrading a lord's mansion are too\ncommon. So few people paid attention to\nLin Shia. Excellent for books. Now\nrecruit my new hero. Lyn Shia took out\nthe hero's token. Exchange for Huasha\ntoken energy. Consume one energy point\nto use the Hasha token. Hua summoning\nfunction to summon a Hasha hero. Hua\nimmediately deducts 1,000 battlefield\nenergy points. Then Lynn Shiao\ncontinued, \"Continue to consume the\nHasha summoning. Roll call. Zuyong.\nDing. Your Hasha token energy is\ninsufficient. How can you recruit\nsomeone like Zhuang who is top-notch in\nboth intelligence and internal affairs\nand whose loyalty is a model for all\nages? I'll accept it if I can't recruit\nanyone with over 40,000 energy.\" Lynn\nSha thought to himself. Lyn Sha decided\nto change the conditions and try a\ndifferent approach to see if he could\nrecruit Jubalang. Requirement one for\nthis event is a hero with strong\ndomestic affairs capabilities.\nRequirement two, absolute loyalty to the\nmonarch/lord.\nRequirement three, he is she has served\nas prime minister. Requirement four,\npostumous title, Woo/Who.\nAs soon as Lynn Sha finished speaking, a\nsystem notification sounded. Ding!\nRecruitment successful. Your Hua Xiao\norders battlefield energy has been\ncompletely deducted. Lyn Shia was\noverjoyed. It worked. It really can\nexploit bugs. Yay! My Zhuang has\narrived. A flash of seven colored light\nterritory. A figure slowly emerged from\nthe portal of light. The figure moved\nwith the stride of a dragon and the gate\nof a tiger. He was tall and strong with\nlong limbs and large joints. He had a\nthick beard, a broad face, and was in\nhis early 40s. His phoenix eyes held\nboth the decisiveness of a martial\nartist and the wisdom of a scholar. Lyn\nSha was taken aback. It wasn't the\nZhuang with his feather fan and silk\nturban. Lyn Sha then realized that the\nconditions he had given were wrong.\nZugal Yangsuous title was Jehong Wu\nJungu, not Wuho Wu. Zugal Yang is\ngenerally referred to as Marque Wu and\nMarque Wu is a general term for Juul\nYang. However, the person who was\npostumously named Marque Wu was not Juul\nYong, but was mostly a military general\ntrying to exploit a system bug only to\nget taught a lesson by the system\ninstead. However, this person spent more\nthan 40,000 battlefield energy to meet\nsuch demanding conditions, which shows\nthat he is quite steady and must be\nquite capable. Who exactly is he? Lyn\nShia. Check this person's attributes.\nChapter 159. So, it was Wong Ming. Check\nthis person's attributes. Wong Ming,\nprime minister of the formerQin dynasty.\nRace, human, Chinese. Quality, golden\nlegend. Level. Level one. Attributes.\nStrength 60 + 12. Spirit 60 + 12.\nConstitution. 60 + 12. Soul 60 + 12.\nSkills. Capable of both military and\npolitical leadership. Firm and remedy.\nFair and rewarding and punishing. Top\ntier strategist. Majesty. Click to view.\nCombat power rating 60 stars. Exclusive\nunit. Internal affairs official. Lynsha\nblinked. It was Wong Ming. Upon\nreceiving the message from the main god,\nWong Ming instantly understood his\nmission. With a powerful stride, he\narrived before Lin Shiao in a few steps\nand knelt down in deep reverence. Your\nsubject, Wong Ming, pays respects to\nyour lordship. So, it's Wong Jinglu.\nPlease rise. Liao&lt;unk&gt;s earlier doubts\nturned into joy. He helped Wong Ming up\nwarmly grasped his hands and said, \"My\nacquisition of Wong Jinglu is like Lu\nBay acquiring Zhuang or Duan of Chi\nacquiring Guanjang. My fortune is\ncomparable to that of Fu Jian.\" Wong\nMing bowed his head humbly. I dare not\ncompare myself to Zhuang and Guan Jong,\nbut I will certainly do my best to\nassist you, my lord, to repay your\nkindness in recognizing my talent.\nFurthermore, I have a question. Who is\nthis Fu Jian? Uh-huh. Just mentioning it\ncasually. He's not an important person.\nLyn Sha thought to himself. As expected,\nthe system directly modified the\nmemories of heroes like Wong Ming who\nare extremely loyal. His original\nmaster, Fu Jian, has disappeared, and\nonly he himself is the one he is loyal\nto. Jinglu, I'll introduce you to a few\npeople who are my right-hand men. You'll\nbe working with them from now on. Lyn\nShao pulled Wong Ming along and\nintroduced Pay Minitsubing and others to\nWong Ming one by one. While letting him\nfamiliarize himself with his hero, Lyn\nShao also observed and examined Wong\nMangs skills. Wong Mang is a hero whose\nfour stats are all 60 points when he is\nlevel one. He is truly a man of both\nliterary and military talents, which\nmatches his skill, capable of both\nmanaging internal affairs and commanding\nthe army. A hero in both military and\npolitical affairs, Wong Ming's internal\naffairs ability is increased by 50% and\nhis efficiency in handling government\naffairs is increased by 50%. When Wong\nMing is a hero in internal affairs but\nnot leading troops, the Lord's\nproduction of all resources is increased\nby 50%. Investment returns are increased\nby 50% and the production efficiency of\nall buildings is increased by 50%. When\nWong Mang leads troops, he automatically\nswitches to a general type hero, gaining\nthe all troop command S-rank skill and\ncan reduce losses in logistics support\nand military equipment. Wongming also\npossesses another formidable skill, top\nstrategist. Wong Ming excels at using\nhis keen observation skills to formulate\ntactical plans, which greatly increases\nthe success rate of his strategies. Wong\nMing is also highly skilled at strategy\nformulation. When his strategies are\nadopted, the overall effectiveness of\nthe strategies increases by 50%. As for\nMajesty, it is one of the keys to\nensuring Wong Mang becomes the prime\nminister. It increases the respect of\nall friendly units other than the master\nfor Wong Mang by 20% and increases the\nfear of all enemies for Wong Mang by 20%\nwhich will affect the morale of the\nenemy to some extent. Lin Sha nodded\nrepeatedly at Wong Ming&lt;unk&gt;s attributes\nand skills. He may not have been as good\nas Zhuang in strategy and domestic\naffairs, but he wasn't far behind. He\nwas among the top generals in China in\nterms of both command and personal\ncombat skills. Wongming is also quite\nadept. I really struck gold. Over 40,000\nbattlefield energy. It was totally worth\nit. After Wong Ming and Lin Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s\nheroes finished exchanging greetings,\nthey looked around Lin Xiao's territory\nand witnessed the efficiency of the\nGolden Legend peasants and the strength\nof various Chinese military units. Just\nthen, the alarm sounded. The demonic\ntide may be late, but it has arrived.\nLyn Sha immediately dawned full armor\nand grabbed his weapons on the demonic\ntides in the official zone. As long as\nthe god system assesses your abilities\nas strong enough, it will always arrange\nfor a stronger demonic tide to attack\nyou. All of my troops are level 40, but\nthey are all gold legendary units and\nepic excellent units. I wouldn't be\nsurprised if some of the monsters in the\ndemon tide are level 50 or 60. Lyn Sha\nsaid, \"Generals, do not underestimate\nthe enemy.\" \"Yes,\" the soldiers answered\nin unison. Be careful when you see that\nabyss demon with the broken horn.\nWithout level restrictions, his strength\nmay surpass all of ours,\" Lyn Sha added.\nPay Min said calmly, \"I can defeat\nanyone who is more than 30 levels above\nme.\" Just as Lynsha was about to remind\nPay Min to be careful, dark clouds\ndrifted in, obscuring half the sky.\nBeneath the clouds, an endless array of\ndemons surged forward. An unprecedented\nmassive magical tide is coming. Wong\nMing, who had just been leveled up to\nlevel 40 by Lin Shiao, bowed to Lin\nShiao and said, \"Lord, please allow me\nto command this battle.\" \"Oh, you're new\nhere, and you dare to lead troops in a\nbattle?\" Not only Lin Sha, but also the\nother heroes around him turned their\nheads to look. Wong Ming is willing to\nstake his life on defeating the invading\nenemy. Great. Looking forward to Wong\nJingl&lt;unk&gt;s performance, Lin Sha readily\nagreed, thinking to himself that Wong\nMing was indeed Wong Ming, demanding\ncommand as soon as he made a move, just\nwanting to show off. Such a strong yet\ninfinitely loyal subordinate is exactly\nwhat he currently lacks. A few hours\nlater, Lynn Shiao, who had been holding\nthe line in the rear, ultimately did not\nuse the Hasha summoning. Imperial heroic\nsoul possession technique as his own\npowerful troops had already gradually\nextinguished the demonic tide. A\ncommotion arose as the victorious\nsoldiers returned. My lord, we are back.\nThe entire army was victorious with not\na single soldier killed. Payman's\nshouting voice came over. Thanks to\nbrother Wong Ming&lt;unk&gt;s excellent\ncommand, we were able to defeat this\nhorde of 100,000 monsters without any\nmajor incident. Lyn Sha looked over and\nsaw Wong Ming and Pay Min with their\narms around each other's shoulders with\nHoing and Chin Leonu behind them. Their\nexpressions a mixture of admiration and\nresentment. It seems that Wong\nMing&lt;unk&gt;s forthright personality is\nquite compatible with the generals under\nhis command. Hatsubing was a master of\nwar, no less than Wong Ming, only he was\na little older and less experienced. Lyn\nSha nodded in satisfaction. He had\nwitnessed Wong Ming&lt;unk&gt;s strength.\nHowever, returning with the soldiers was\nalso an abyss demon whose body was\ncovered in lava and riddled with wounds.\nBrans is weaker than I thought. Upon\ncloser inspection, Lin Sha realized it\nwas a two-horned abyss demon. My lord,\nWongming bowed down first. This abyssal\ndemon is one of the generals of this\ndemonic tide. Just as we were about to\nkill him, he suddenly said that he had\nimportant information to report. Rest\nassured, \"My lord, General Hua and young\nMaster P have severely injured this\ndemon, and he is powerless to resist.\"\n\"Oh, do you have any news to tell me?\"\nLyn Shao stood with his hands behind his\nback and asked calmly. The abyss demon\nspewed sulfurous steam from its nostrils\nand said haltingly, \"My princess Andrea\ninvites the human lord Lynn Shia to be\nher guest.\" \"I have important matters to\ndiscuss.\" Lynn Shia frowned slightly,\nsensing that this was not a simple\nmatter. Lyn Sha, once this is\naccomplished, your highness may arrange\nfor the human Lynn Shia to marry into\nyour family. If human Lyn Sha agrees, I\nwill open the portal now. Lyn Shia, huh?\nAll the generals turned their attention\nto Lyn Sha. Lyn Sha frowned even more.\nShameless. Here we go again. Don't try\nto fool me. Lyn Sha thrust his sword\ninto the abyss demon's chest. Chapter\n160. Semi- divine artifact completed,\nbut the special effects are terrible.\nLyn Sha thrust his sword into the chest,\nkilling the abyss demon. As the abyss\ndemon turned to ashes and slowly\ndisappeared, the demons are truly\ndetermined to destroy us. Lyn Sha\naddressed the crowd with righteous\nindignation. These devils, one after\nanother, keep bringing up their\nprincess, trying to smear me. Every time\nthere's a demonic surge, she has to come\nand shout it out as if she's afraid no\none knows how desperate Andrea is to get\nmarried. She's afraid others won't know\nthis, which has been messing with me.\nLyn Sha shook his head and said, \"You\nall know best what kind of person I, Lyn\nSha, am. How can we let these low-level\nschemes and tricks affect us and make us\nlose our composure?\" \"Yes, except for\nWong Ming.\" All the soldiers nodded\nsolemnly in agreement. The demon race is\nour sworn enemy. \"Yes, except for Wong\nMing.\" All the soldiers continued to\nnod. Lyn Sha stopped and looked at the\nsoldiers with suspicion. The soldiers\nall wore solemn expressions and serious\ndemeanor except for Pay Min who seemed\nunable to suppress a smile. Pay Min, get\nout of here. You're a black sheep. Lyn\nSha kicked Pay Min out of the line. Lyn\nSha noticed out of the corner of his eye\nthat Wong Ming&lt;unk&gt;s brows visibly\nfurrowed. It seems that Wong Ming\ncouldn't stand this relaxed and\ncomfortable superior subordinate\nrelationship. Well, he is a person who\nvalues order very much. Lyn Sha thought\nto himself, \"Ding! Your hero Wong\nMing&lt;unk&gt;s loyalty has reached 100%.\nReady to go through fire and water.\"\n\"Well, on the surface he's a\nconservative, but inside he's incredibly\nhappy.\" \"My lord, I have heard rumors\nabout you and this demon princess,\" Wong\nMing said in a low voice. \"We Chinese\nare of noble birth and should indeed not\nhave any dealings with the demon race.\nIt is truly our good fortune that our\nLord is not blinded by beauty or misled\nby information of uncertain truth. Lyn\nSha nodded. What you said makes a lot of\nsense. I will pay attention. Just then,\nLyn Sha felt a voice calling from\nwithin. It's the third shadowy figure.\nWhy are ancient demons seeking me out at\nthis time? Could it be? Is the semi-\ndivine artifact modified from angel\ncards finished? Lin Shao felt a surge of\nexcitement and quickly made the\narrangements. Wong Ming Hoing Chin Leang\nYu another beast tide may be coming\nsoon. So be prepared to defend. I need\nto leave for a while. When I am not\nhere, all decisions shall be made by\nBaoi. Yes, my lord. Lin Sha arrived at\nthe war hall and immediately began to\nsilently recite a spell in his mind. Lin\nBing Dha Ja Jean Li Chen Shing. In an\ninstant, the world spun around. Lin Shao\nappeared in an unknown place. The\nbuildings, both real and elucory, are\nscattered across the sky. The earth is\nbroken, and cold winds blow through the\nfragmented air. Chaos, decay, secrecy,\nand strangeness. Three dark figures were\nalready waiting ahead. He, the second\nshadowy figure, immediately gave a\nbitter laugh, and Lyn Sha couldn't help\nbut purse his lips. Damn, how many more\ntimes will this petty ancient demon try\nto steal the laugh? Stop laughing. How\nmany soul elders did this guy eat? Your\nlaugh is even more awful than the potato\nitself. What is a soul hall elder? Never\nmind, you don't know anyway. It's from a\nChinese online novel. I'll copy it down\nfor you later as a friendly gift. Lynn\nShiao shook his head, ignoring the\nsecond shadowy figure, and instead\nlooked at the third shadowy figure who\nhad a worried expression. Senior number\nthree, is my semi- divine artifact\nready? The third shadowy figure stood\nthere, stunned and unresponsive. Senior\nnumber three, third brother. The leader\nof the shadowy figures couldn't stand it\nany longer and shouted, startling the\nthird brother awake. Huh? Oh, okay.\nOkay. The third shadowy figure was\nenveloped in mist as he said evasively,\n\"I've finished making your semi- divine\nartifact. It's this one.\" He pulled out\na gleaming long sword and handed it to\nLyn Sha. This is a weapon made by using\na long sword of legendary gold quality\nas its base and incorporating the\nmythical angel card. It can cut through\niron like mud and is indestructible. It\neven contains a trace of divinity, so it\ncan protect you from mental magic,\ncurses, charms, and so on. Only the\nthird shadowy figure hesitated as if he\nwanted to say something, but then\nstopped. Just what? Originally, semi-\ndivine artifacts had special effects,\nbut I can't enchant this one with skills\nor special effects right now. So, at the\nmoment, it can only be considered an\nunparalleled long sword. What? Lyn Sha\nwas taken aback. What's the difference\nbetween a weapon without any special\neffects and a fire poker? View\nproperties, unnamed weapon. Quality,\nmythical, incomplete. Attributes, base\nattack power, 1550. Special attributes,\nnone. Although this baseline attack\npower is almost insane. It really is\njust a fire poker, Lyn Sha blurted out.\nUpon hearing this, the third shadowy\nfigure scratched his head sheepishly. I\noriginally wanted to enchant it with a\ntop tier defensive skill like divine\ndescent or holy shield, but the second\nbrother insisted on enchanting me with\nthe blood witch's sexual harvest or the\nsuccubus absolute charm or at the very\nleast the centur strong body and\nexceptionally long talent skills saying\nthat you would definitely need them. The\nthird shadowy figure asked, \"I've never\neven heard of that centaur's next skill.\nThank you so much, Hashan, for your\nexceptional talent. Lynn Shia glanced at\nthe smug second in command in black and\nshook his head helplessly. My elder\nbrother said that it needs to be\nenchanted with forbidden level\ndestruction magic such as annihilation\nwound and death finger. The third\nshadowy figure said, he said that when\nyou draw your sword and prepare to duel\nwith the enemy, and the enemy has\nalready taken a fighting stance. If you\nsuddenly strike the enemy on the head\nwith a death finger, it will definitely\nhave the effect of catching them off\nguard.\" Lyn Sha then looked at the\ndark-kinned leader who was putting on a\nserious and aloof expression. Adult\ntimes have changed. Lynsha silently\nrecited the line in his mind. He never\nexpected that the seemingly most\ncomposed leader of the shadows would be\nso unpredictable. The three of us argued\nendlessly and finally decided to enchant\nGod's descent, nutrition, and death\nfinger on them. \"Good, very good,\" Lyn\nSha thought expressionlessly. As a\nresult, the skills conflicted. All the\nskills disappeared, and even the swords\nfour-dimensional attribute bonus was\ngone. The third shadowy figure said,\n\"Later, we tried enchanting other\nskills, but all of them failed. Sorry,\nwe have no choice but to deliver this\nsemi-finish product to you. At least\nit's quite sharp. You can use it to chop\nradishes or something.\" Lyn Sha\nsuppressed a twitching smile and asked,\n\"You turned a semi-deine artifact into a\npiece of scrap metal that can't be\nenchanted. In fact, I feel that this\nweapon can still be enchanted. I can\nsense the magical fluctuations. the\nprevious enchanting skills have merged\ninto one and are chaotically attached to\nthe weapon. If there is a skill or\neffect that happens to match this\nchaotic state, perhaps this semi- divine\nartifact will become normal. We've tried\nthousands of skills and effects and none\nof them match. I simply can't figure out\nwhat to do. So, you can give it a try,\nthe third shadowy figure said earnestly.\nMe? Lyn Sha smiled. You ancient demons\nwho have lived for thousands of years\nhave tried so many skill effects and\nnone of them match. How would I know\nwhat effects they are? A 100 instant\nkill of someone named Haong. Ding.\nEnchantment successful. The unnamed\nweapon has been enchanted with the\neffect. 100% chance to instantly kill\nanyone named Haong. The system has\nautomatically named it Hero Slaying\nSword. Congratulations on obtaining the\nsword of slaying heroes. Lyn Sha, three\ndark figures. Are you kidding me?\nChapter 1 1612. Shawn by Chian reports\nfor duty and relocates her territory.\nLyn Sha picked up the sword of slaying\nheroes and checked its attributes. Sword\nto slay heroes. Quality mythical\nincomplete. Attributes. Base attack\npower 1550. Strength + 100. Spirit plus\n100. Constitution plus 100. Soul plus\n200. Special attribute 100% chance of\nkilling someone named Hua Xiang. Lin Sha\nput down the Jean Xang sword without\nexpression. The three dark figures\nopposite all had serious expressions.\nOne looked up at the sky and another\nlooked down at his toes.\nCongratulations, young friend. You have\nobtained a semi- divine artifact that\nyou have chosen. Looking across the\nentire blue star, the total number of\nsemi- divine artifacts plus divine\nartifacts is definitely no more than 10.\nYou have become one of the most powerful\npeople in the world. The leader of the\nshadowy figures suppressed a laugh and\nfinally managed to finish speaking. If\nany of these 10 people is named Huang,\nthen I am the most powerful person in\nthe world. Think positively. Maybe there\nreally is someone named Haong. Big\nBrother, there are only two people from\nLong Shia domain among the holders of\nthe 10 divine artifacts, and neither of\nthem is named Hua Xiang. Nobody in other\ncountries has the surname Hua either.\nHey, second brother, why are you\nstepping on me? Then thank you for your\ncomforting words, Lyn Sha said calmly.\nThe green hills remain unchanged, and\nthe clear waters flow on forever.\nFarewell. Just as the leader of the\nshadowy figures was about to wave his\nhand, Lynn Shiao suddenly added, \"By the\nway, a demon from the abyss said that\nAndrea had something important to\ndiscuss with me, but I ignored it. I\nwonder what the relationship is between\nthe seniors and Andrea, so let's keep an\neye on it.\" The leader of the shadowy\nfigures was taken aback, then slowly\nnodded to indicate that he understood\nand then waved his sleeve to see Lynn\nSha off. In the dense forest of Lnon\ndistrict, a man dressed entirely in\nblack, his face masked except for his\neyes, carrying two Japanese swords, one\nlong and one short, was moving silently.\nFumako, one of the four great ninjas\ndispatched by Kenzo Doora from the\nShikoku region. The two regions share\nborders and apart from some natural\nbarriers and the need to avoid powerful\nlords guarding the frontiers, there are\nmany areas where travel is unimpeded.\nThis resulted in people from both\nregions frequently meeting each other.\nKenzo Dohura has been imprisoned, but my\nsuperior still ordered me to continue\nthe mission of assassinating Lin Shiao.\nWhile stealthily observing his\nsurroundings, Fuma Codoro pondered.\nSince the discovery of what appears to\nbe traces of Lin Shia in the forbidden\nzone of the dead, no further clues about\nhim have been found. It feels like a\nmaster of disguise or infiltration\ncleaned up the remaining traces. Is this\nperson so cautious and cunning? Really a\nnewbie who has just entered the official\nzone. Just then, thunder rumbled from\nthe distant mountains. A large patch of\ndark clouds covering half the sky\ndrifted rapidly toward a certain\nlocation. Is this a demonic tide? Such a\nlarge-scale event, this demonic tide is\nquite significant. I'd guess it's a\nlevel 50 or 60 lord leveling up.\nCodorofa was about to leave. A\npossibility suddenly occurred to him.\nPerhaps it has something to do with Lin\nShiao, so he changed direction and\nstealthily moved into the distance. Lyn\nXiao's consciousness returned to his\nterritory. He opened his eyes and found\nhimself standing in the war hall holding\nthe semi- divine artifact, the sword of\nslaying heroes. Is a semi- divine\nartifact a joke? Lyn Sha shook his head\nhelplessly. It's sharp enough, so apart\nfrom those nine divine and semi-deine\nartifacts, there shouldn't be any other\nweapon that can fight against it. After\ncomforting himself, Lyn Sha walked out\nof the war hall and encountered Wong\nMing and a group of soldiers walking\nback to their territory. Greetings. Your\nlordship. The invading beast tide has\nbeen completely wiped out. Lyn Sha\nnodded. His hero was indeed very\ncapable. The communicator rang and it\nwas Tu Shan by Chian. Lyn Sha connected\nthe call and Tu Shawn by Chian's\nyouthful face and busted lowly body\nappeared on the communication interface\nwearing animal ears and a white lace\nLolita dress. She still has an adorable\ninnocent look on her face. Brother Lyn\nSha, are you surprised? me, the kidney\ndeficiency man, Shun Ningming, and I\njust finished three books and are now in\nthe main area. Hey, pretty girl. Don't\ncall me that nickname. It sounds awful.\nHe's disdainful voice rang out, and his\nhead reappeared on the general selection\nscreen. His dark circles under his eyes\nstill even more pronounced than his\nsmoky eye makeup. Sigh. These flower\nfairies are still too thirsty. I should\nmake them restrain themselves. This\nthought flashed through Linhao&lt;unk&gt;s\nmind. Boss, we've arrived at the\nofficial area. What are your orders? I\ncan't wait to get started. And then\nthere's Chun Ningming, that quiet guy.\nHe can't wait to get to work either. The\nscene shifts to Chun Ningming, who bows\nto Lin Shao and says, \"Boss Lin Sha.\" It\nturned out that the three of them had\njust entered the official area and were\nreporting for duty at the city lord's\nmansion. Brother Lyn Shao Tu Shan by\nChin took back the communication\ninterface and said to Lyn Shao, \"We are\nstill waiting here for everyone to\ngather before we go in to report to the\ncity lord.\" But the guards and other\nyoung lords here seemed to be very\npolite to us. Tu Shan by Chian leaned\ncloser mysteriously and said, \"Following\nbrother Lin Shia is really the right\nchoice. I feel like my status has\nrisen.\" He said casually, \"Of course, my\nboss is amazing. He's only been in the\nofficial zone for a few days, but he's\nalready helped the official zone win the\nresource competition. The entire Lnon\nregion has received trillions of\nresource rewards. The city lord\ngenerously set aside 30% for public\nexpenses and distributed the rest\nequally among all officially registered\nlords in the districts. We just joined\nand we were allocated tens of thousands\nof resources, which means we don't have\nto work for a week. It's a great deal.\nIn addition, the existence of the luck\ntalisman is enjoyed by all lords, which\nincreases both lifespan and physique,\nmaking them strong and healthy. \"All\nright,\" Lyn Sha said with a laugh. \"The\nlittle bit of physical enhancement you\ngained can't outweigh your wasteful\nspending. Now that everyone's here, get\nto work. I'll talk to you again after\nthe audience is over.\" The three vassel\nlords all nodded in agreement, then shut\ndown their communications and went to\nreport to Chu Yusi. After waiting a\nmoment, Lyn Shao sent his precise\ncoordinates via private message and\ngranted access to the three people in\nhis territory. Soon the portal opened\nand a white stocking lowly, a school\nuniform boy and a scarred silent man\narrived in Lyn Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s territory.\nBoss, brother Lyn Sha, boss Lyn Sha. Lyn\nSha nodded and led the three to the war\nhall, asking, where do you three place\nyour territories? After the three told\nhim their location, Lynsha pondered for\na moment and said, \"Let's move here and\nlive near my place in Hulu Pass. This\nlocation is excellent with abundant\nresources. The monsters nearby aren't\ntoo difficult, while there are powerful\nbosses to challenge within a medium\ndistance. There's no one around.\" Lyn\nSha pointed out several locations on the\nhuge realistic sand table. Although I am\nmore powerful now, I have made more\nenemies. As my vassal lords, you are\nlikely to be targeted. These are the\nbest positions available. You can\nconsider them. The three understood that\nwhat Lin Sha said was true. So, they\ndecided to return to their territory to\nrelocate. I'll cover the relocation\ncosts. Lyn Sha waved his hand and threw\nin several relocation talismans. Yay,\nbrother. Lyn Sha is so nice. Tu Shan by\nChian rushed over again, hugging Lin\nXiao&lt;unk&gt;s arm and rubbing against him.\nLyn Xiao calmly withdrew his hand again,\nsaying, \"The amazing touch and\nelasticity. Then everyone can get\nstarted. After the relocation is\ncomplete, I'll give you all a big gift.\nChapter 162, Hashau reinforced cement\nand concrete. A few days later, in the\nvast hilly terrain of the official\ndistrict, Lin Shao, Ding Lelay, Tu Shan\nby Chian, Hiz, and Chuning Ming led\nheroes and soldiers forming a force of\nover a thousand people that traverse the\nmountains. I called you all here today\nto introduce you to something great, Lyn\nSha said. But this requires several\nmaterials that the current god system\ncannot name. So I simply called all of\nyou together so you can recognize these\nmaterials and build the wonderful things\nI'm talking about on your own. What is\nit? Brother Lin Sha Tu Shan by Chin\nasked hopping and skipping. He a\nbuilding that can protect you well and\nis not restricted by territory so it can\nbe built outside the territory. Lynn Sha\ndidn't say much and led his troops\nforward slowly. During this time, he saw\nWong Ming, Huubing, and Shin Leong Yu\ndiligently running around, scouting,\nsurveying the terrain, arranging scouts,\nand reorganizing the troops from time to\ntime. A team exploring another world\nunder the arrangement of a few people is\nas solid and steadfast as an army on a\nmarch. We're here. Lynn Shia nodded as\nhe saw the Rocky Mountain in front of\nhim. This is the first material,\nlimestone. Gentlemen, let's&lt;unk&gt; begin\nmining. wild monsters guarding this\ndesolate mountain, nor any indication of\nmineral veins. Why would they want to\nmine these white stones for no reason?\nBut Lyn Xiao's mystery and power still\nled them to choose unconditional\nobedience. So Pay Min was dragged by Lin\nShiao to do hard labor. What? You want\nme to attack this mountain? Stop talking\nnonsense. Your Frostorn and Fire Delight\nare both legendary weapons. What\ndifficulty is there in attacking this\nkind of mountain? Pay Min was forced to\nunleash his eastward strike sword\ntechnique, which caused rocks to fall\ncontinuously. Several vassal lords also\nhad their own heroes who unleashed some\nhigh burst magic and quickly blasted a\nlot of rocks out of the mountain. Using\nmagic to mine is no less effective than\nthe large machinery in my original\nworld. Lyn Shia nodded with\nsatisfaction. It seems like I found a\npath to wealth. After the rubble was\nblasted out, hundreds of farmers and\nflower fairies joined in. The golden\nlegend says that the farmer's hoe is\nindestructible. When swung, it leaves\nonly after images and quickly breaks the\nlarge stone into gravel. All right, put\neveryone into the god system warehouse.\nIf there's free space to take advantage\nof, why not take advantage of it? With\nthe logistical hassle gone, Lynn Shiao\ndistributed tens of thousands of tons of\ncrushed stone to everyone for storage.\nNext, the next target, Clay, to kill\nmonsters of appropriate strength based\non the strength of the lords. His\nbrilliant mind was also working at high\nspeed, managing to train and advance\nsimultaneously. Because of his\nunderstanding of wild monsters, the\nmonsters he chose for his vassal lords\nand himself were just the right\nstrength. Neither too difficult to level\nup and cause casualties, nor too easy to\ngain little experience. Lyn Xiao's\nsmooth and skillful maneuvers impressed\nthe lords and his heroes, who looked at\nhim with nothing but admiration. We've\narrived. This is the clay soil. Let the\nfarmers dig it up. All the farmers\ncontinued working and quickly dug up a\nlarge amount of clay. Next, I will\ndemonstrate how to synthesize the\nmaterials we need. Lyn Sha took out a\npiece of iron ore, crushed it into\npowder, then took out the limestone from\nbefore, crushed it into powder, and\nmixed it with clay powder. Then, Lyn Sha\nsummoned Oh, Yzi, the master blacksmith,\nwho raised his hand, and a flame shot\ninto the air, leaving Lin Sha\nspeechless. What happened to believing\nin science? What does it mean that this\nblacksmith can directly summon spirit\nfire? Oh, Yzi controlled the flame.\nFirst, slowly burning Lin Xiao's\nlimestone and clay mixture powder into a\nmolten clinker. Then, it is mixed with\niron powder in ground. Finally, a\ngrayish white powder appeared. This is\nthe new material I'm going to teach you\nabout, cement. I've learned it. Under\nthe influence of eternal peace and\nprosperity, continuing the lost learning\nof the sages, all lords have gained a 5x\nincrease in learning speed. In addition,\nthe method of making cement is not\ncomplicated so they can learn it all in\none go. But boss, what's the use of this\nthing used for building construction?\nWhy do we have to craft the materials\nourselves when we can just prepare the\nbasic materials from the systems list\nand let the farmers build? He asked in\nconfusion. Besides, we have many\nhigh-grade materials on the battlefield\nof 10,000 races, such as diamonds, ton\nwood, and meteorite iron, which are all\nextremely hard materials. Why not use\nthose materials to build the structures?\nWill this powder work? Lynsha nodded. In\nfact, he had discovered this when he\nfirst arrived in this world. In the real\nworld of Langsha Kingdom, all buildings\nwere constructed using magic, or rather\ndirectly by the power projected by the\nmain god system, the battlefield of all\nraces. The world has gained more\nconvenient things, but has lost\ntraditional and reliable craftsmanship\nusing diamonds, ton wood, and meteorite\niron is certainly possible, but can you\ngather such a massive amount of\nmaterials right now? Lynn Sha waved his\nhand and a design drawing appeared\nbefore everyone. This is a legendary\nspecial building. Golden legend quality\nHashia Tulu construction blueprint 1.\nThe words Hasha have been censored by\nLin Sha. Requirements: 2,000 meteorite\niron, 1,000 star moon stone, 1,000\nobsidian, 2500 fine wood, 2500 fine\nstone, 2500 fine iron, 2500 fine copper,\n50 aggerwood trunks. Defense 1 million\nplus. Damage value, base attack power,\n1,000 depending on the number of\ngarrison troops. Special ability one,\nshelter. Shelter all designated units\nwithin a 10 km radius. enhance their\ndefense, provide early warning, and can\nurgently collect fleeing units. Special\nskill two, absolute defense. The Tulu is\nimmune to damage from magic and skills\nbelow grade A. Reduces damage from magic\nand skills above grade A by 80% and\nreduces all physical damage by 90%.\nSpecial skill three, livable. Tulu can\nbe used for designated units to live and\nprovide the ability to resist the\ndangers of nighttime battles between all\nraces. It can also produce fresh water\non its own. When besieged, morale will\nnot be reduced and the holding time will\nbe increased by 50%. Construction time\nfor 180 hours. Construction requirements\ngolden legendary farmer. Wow, the lords\npresent were all in an uproar. A\nbuilding of legendary gold quality. 1\nmillion defense points. Absolute\ndefense. He exclaimed in amazement. My\nthree territories plus the walls only\nhave 20,000 defense points. Doesn't this\nmean it's more than 50 times stronger\nthan my own house? And it can even\nattack enemies. Heay shouted, \"I want to\nmove in. I want to move in. My Yaoya\nneeds her own room. This Tulu is indeed\na powerful building of legendary\nquality.\" Dinglay however poured cold\nwater on the idea. Unfortunately, the\nrequirements for this building are too\ndemanding and we cannot meet them at\npresent. Meteorite, star moonstone, and\nobsidian sell for astronomical prices in\nthe official zone. It would take us\nseveral years to accumulate enough to\nmake enough. And agarwood tree trunks,\nthat's also a very rare material, etc.,\n\"Brother Shia, you mean?\" Lyn Sha\nnodded. Why are we going through all\nthis trouble? Isn't it just to replace\nthese materials? Agurwood trunk. I have\nan agggerwood forest. Golden legend\nfarmers. I give it to you. Meteorite\niron, star moon stone, and obsidian can\nall be completely replaced with cement,\nrefined stone, and refined iron. That's\nwhat we call reinforced concrete.\nChapter 163. Sudden danger. The astute\nWong Ming. Reinforced cement concrete.\nThe vassel lords repeated the tongue-\ntwisting name, their faces full of\nconfusion. It certainly can't compare to\nthe top tier materials from the\nbattlefield of 10,000 races, but at\nleast there's plenty of it. Lynsha\nchuckled and snapped his fingers. Let's\nbuild it right here. Then dozens of\nfarmers came to the crowd and mixed the\nfreshlymade cement powder with river\nsand, spreading it evenly. Several\nflower fairies continuously summoned\nwater, which was slowly added to the\ncement powder. In a short time, the\ndesolate countryside became a bustling\nconstruction site. Once the mixture was\nstirred until it became evenly viscous,\nseveral blacksmiths stepped forward,\nadded the special refined stones unique\nto the battlefield of 10,000 races, and\ncontinued stirring. Then, Lynn Sha took\nout Agurwood as the main beam, refined\niron as the steel reinforcement, and all\nother materials were prepared. Learn the\ngolden legend quality tulu construction\nblueprint one and master the method of\nbuilding tulu. Ding. You have learned\nhow to build tulu. Build the tulu\nimmediately. Ding. Your materials are\ninsufficient. You are missing 2,000\nmeteorite iron, 1,000 star moon stone,\nand 1,000 obsidian. Use alternative\nmaterials. Lyn Sha picked up the\nthoroughly mixed cement and with a flash\nof white light, the cement was collected\nand analyzed by the god system. The\nstrength of this alternative material\npassed the test. Its magical\nconductivity is weaker, but its\ntoughness is stronger. The main systems\nassessment, it can be used as a\nsubstitute, but the attributes of the\ntulu will change. Accept. If accepted,\nthis construction method and material\nratio will be added to subsequent tulu\nconstruction projects. Except ding. You\nneed 500 ordinary farmers or 350\nexcellent farmers or 10 legendary gold\nfarmers. Use the golden legendary farmer\nfor construction. Immediately 10\nlegendary golden farmers came over,\nbrandished their tools, and began\nconstruction. The main god system\nprojected a huge phantom image and the\nfarmers operated it swiftly as if\ncasting a building spell and soaring\nthrough the clouds. Construction has\nbegun. But even with Lin Xiao's eternal\npeace which have the time, it still\nrequires 240 hours. In other words, it\nwill take 10 days for this Hasha Tulu to\nbe completed. During this period, Lynn\nShiao will use camp runes to ensure that\nfarmers can work at night and will not\nbe swallowed up by the darkness of the\nbattlefield of 10,000 races. This place\nhappens to be the hub between my\nterritory and yours. So, I built the\nTulu here so that we can support each\nother. Of course, this is also where the\nlargest limestone and clay resources in\nthe area are located, making it\nconvenient for us to mine them at any\ntime. Dinglay added. Building the tulu\nhere also helps to control this\nresource. Lynn Sha nodded. Now I will\nteach you the methods of building tulu.\nLyn Shia used the continuing the lost\nlearning of the sages technique to teach\neveryone the construction methods of the\nChinese tulu. He can easily teach the\nskills he already possesses. Thank you,\nboss Lin Shiao. Thank you, brother Lyn\nShao. The lords were extremely impressed\nby Lin Xiao's ability to teach them how\nto build tulu earthn buildings in China.\nI just asked the god system. If I build\nthe tulu according to my method, the\noverall attributes will be weaker. The\ndefense value will only be 800,000 and\nthe reduction against magic damage will\nonly be 50%, but the reduction against\nphysical damage will be 95%.\nOverall, it's still a building with a\ngolden legend, just a few minor\nweaknesses. Lin Sha was speaking when\nWong Ming walked up to him with a\nserious expression. My lord, I have\nsomething important to report. Please\nfeel free to speak. Wong Ming didn't\nspeak, but just lowered his head, his\nface heavy. Lyn Shao understood Wong\nMing&lt;unk&gt;s character, and Wong Ming knew\nthat the people around him were his most\ntrusted vassel lords. But if even he\nfelt that the vassel lords shouldn't\nhear it, it must be a very important\nmatter. Lyn Sha waved his hand,\nsignaling Ding Lay and the others to\nstep back. My lord, we have lost a\nfaceless one. Um, Lyn Sha became alert.\nHow did he die? He quickly checked his\npanel and sure enough, the Faceless Ones\ncolumn read 19. The Faceless Ones are\nepic units with combat power equivalent\nto well-known monsters such as Nest\nDemons, Abyss Demons, and Cyclops at the\nsame level. Most importantly, they were\nelite spies created by the demon\nprincess Andrea. They were cunning,\nunpredictable, and cautious by nature.\nThe Faceless Ones can also transform\ninto any human form. The evidence Lin\nSha recently obtained of Sakura\nShichurro and Roland's brutal massacre\nof their own kind was filmed by a\nfaceless one who infiltrated Japanese\nterritory. After the deed was done, all\n20 faceless men returned unharmed. And\nnow on the vast wilderness of the Lan\ndistrict, a faceless one has actually\ndied. The matter has not yet been fully\ninvestigated,\" Wong Ming said in a low\nvoice. \"But I have reason to suspect\nthat a master has infiltrated our\nvicinity.\" Lyn Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s eyes suddenly\nnarrowed. When the main force came out\nto search for new mineral veins, General\nHuatubing, General Chin Leang Yu, and I\narranged for the White Spear soldiers to\nguard and keep watch on the perimeter\nwhile the Faceless Ones patrolled and\nkept watch for dozens of kilometers\naround. Their squad leaders contact each\nother every 30 minutes, and the Faceless\nOne had already disappeared when they\nlast contacted him. The team members\ncommunication indicated that he had been\nkilled in action and the squad leader\ncould not find his body. Wong Ming spoke\nrapidly. I already know about the lord's\ndeeds. The heavenly people organization\nand the upper echelons of the four\nkingdoms region all want to kill the\nlord. Therefore, I suspect that a\nhigh-ranking lord or hero has already\ninfiltrated the area. Lynn Sha remained\ncalm. He slowly stroked his chin, his\nmind racing, and said slowly. Bowsi's\nconcealment skills are still intact. All\nmy teleportation portals are blocked.\nBefore we take action, we use the\ncelestial perspective to confirm that\nthere are no lords within a radius of\nnearly 1,000 km. How did the enemy find\nus? Wong Mang, my subordinate suspects\nthat the demonic tide was too intense\nand was observed. It should have arrived\nnearby, but it has not yet determined\nour location. Perhaps it wasn't\nconfirmed that it was me. They must be\nhere for you, Lord. Didn't you see\nsomeone break into the forbidden zone in\nthe war hall earlier? That person was\nincredibly stealthy and left no useful\ntraces, but his destination, the\nforbidden zone of the dead, is obvious.\nLyn Sha nodded in agreement. Wong\nMing&lt;unk&gt;s observation, memory, and\ncomprehensive analytical abilities were\nindeed impressive. We can't open the\nportal and go back directly now.\nOtherwise, the enemy will roam around\nnearby and eventually find my base. Our\nonly option might be to take him down.\nWong Ming, do you think the opponent is\nstrong? My lord, even a lion must go all\nout to hunt a rabbit. There are no level\nrestrictions in the official zone, but\nlords above level 100 are mostly engaged\nin expeditions outside. The enemy is a\nlion, and we are rabbits. Lyn Sha\ninterjected. But the enemy hates us to\nthe bone. So naturally, they won't send\nus a barely strong experience boost like\nin a novel. Wong Ming said, \"Therefore,\nI believe that it is not an exaggeration\nto overestimate it no matter what.\" Lynn\nSha summoned Pay Min. Can you kill a\nlevel 40 plus Faceless One silently\nwithout him sending any information? Pay\nMin pondered for a moment. Understanding\nthe Faceless One's specialties. No,\nkilling the Faceless One is not\ndifficult, but preventing him from\nsending out telepathic communications\nis. Lyn Sha nodded. The enemy's strength\nis at least equivalent to a powerful\nlevel 70 hero. Huh? How did you\ncalculate that? Pay was surprised.\nPaymen is over level 40, but he can\nfight against level 70. If Payman can't\ndo that, then the enemy is stronger than\nhim. payment. Although it feels a bit\noff, I'll just take it as the Lord\npraising me. Chapter 164 countermeasures\npowerful ninjas exposure. I think we\nneed to raise the threat level of the\nenemy a bit. Let us say they are stealth\nassassins with a minimum level of 70 and\na maximum level of 100. Wong Ming tugged\nat his beard, his expression still\nanxious. You're right. This is the\nstrongest enemy I've encountered since\nraces. There are no level restrictions,\nno suppression, only naked killing\nintent toward me, Lyn Sha said. And it's\nimpossible for us to reach level 70 in\nthe short term. The good news is that\nthe other party should only be one\nperson. The traces observed in the\nforbidden zone of the dead only show the\ntrajectory of one person. with a\nnumerical advantage and playing on our\nhome turf. We might still have a glimmer\nof hope. If his name were Haong, he\nwouldn't be afraid at all. Lyn Sha\nthought to himself with a\nself-deprecating smile. Unfortunately,\nthe other party was clearly sent by the\nCelestials or the Japanese. So, the\npossibility was zero. Hands in a fist\nsalute. My lord, I suggest that we take\nimmediate action to intercept and kill\nthis scoundrel before he can figure out\nour actual situation. Oh, you already\nhave a plan. Exactly. Somewhere in the\nEastern Kingdom, an elderly ninja knelt\non a Tatama mat, leisurely drinking tea.\nThe communication rang and the elderly\nninja slowly opened his eyes. After\nseeing who it was, a hint of somnity\nappeared in his eyes. Lord Haidtojo, the\nvoice on the other end was\nauthoritative. Why has Fumako still not\nachieved anything? Has your ninja\nlordship truly fallen? Or is it that\nthis commission was made by Kenzo Dohara\nand now that he's imprisoned, you're\njust sherking your responsibilities?\nFaced with the interrogation, the\nelderly ninja chuckled and said, \"Prime\nMinister, please calm down. That Lynn\nShiao is indeed too cunning. Even one of\nmy four strongest ninjas has to admit\nhis prowess.\" Oh, instead of trying to\nfind a solution, you're praising the\nenemy. Your excellency, please trust our\nexpertise. Fumodoro has been\ninfiltrating the Rhinan district for 2\nweeks, but we only recently made a\nbreakthrough. Explain. There must be a\nmaster of stealth or disguise around\nLynsha. In addition, he is cautious,\ncunning, and suspicious by nature. After\nfinding a few traces of the forbidden\nzone of the dead, Fumako has made no\nfurther progress. Prime Minister, please\ncalm down, but lords all need to be\nupgraded. Yesterday, Fumodoro observed a\ngiant demonic tide in the wilderness of\nthe reunion region, which is how he\nobtained a clue. Demonic tide? You mean\nLynn Sha upgraded to level four in less\nthan half a month after entering the\nofficial server? Exactly. Only people\nlike that are qualified to be our\nopponents. A hint of smuggness flashed\nin the old ninja's eyes. It's a pity\nthat his genius was both his strength\nand his weakness. It was because of the\ndark cloud of the demonic tide that he\nwas exposed and Fumako found a faceless\none who had planted a sentry nearby. The\nFaceless One. Tojo Hideki's tone became\nmore forceful. That's right, the\nFaceless One. Although the Faceless One\nis powerful, a level 40 Faceless One is\nstill too weak in front of the level 85\nFumakoto. Hideaki Tojo said, \"When Lynn\nShiao defeated those fools from the\ncelestial realm, he used the faceless\nones. These are epic units of the demon\nrace, and very few people are qualified\nto recruit them.\" The elderly ninja\ncouldn't help but smile slightly. So,\nLyn Shiao is nearby. Now that the\ncenturies have been found, why haven't\nwe found Lin Sha yet? Your excellency,\nthat's why I praised Lyn Sha. He is too\ncunning. The Faceless Ones have\ntelepathic communication. So the wind\ndemon has no choice but to kill him with\none blow. But Prime Minister, rest\nassured, within 3 days, Fumakodoro will\nbe able to search this area of tens of\nthousands of square kilm, find Lin Sha,\nand then kill this fiend. The voice on\nthe other end sounded satisfied. One of\nthe four great ninjas at level 85. If he\ncan't even take down a level 40 lord, he\nmight as well commit Sepuku in a\nheartbeat. That's inevitable. This is\nthe best plan I can think of right now.\nWong Mang said, \"If any of you have\nbetter strategies or additions, please\nbring them up.\" Hitsubing and Chin Leong\nYu exchanged a glance and shook their\nheads. \"No more.\" Pay Min shrugged.\n\"Anyway, no matter who comes up with the\nstrategy, I'll still have to fight the\nenemy one- on-one. I'll save my energy\nfor fighting and not think about it\nanymore. Lynn Shia, that's because all\nyou know how to do is fight. After\nsaying that, he turned to Baoi and\nasked, \"Are you all right?\" Ba shook her\nhead. I have no problem. Lyn Shia then\nlooked at Dinglay. I haven't even had a\nchance to show off with you yet, but I\nalready need to use you. Dinglay\nlaughed. Fortune favors the bold.\nBesides, I'm just playing a supporting\nrole. The one who truly decides the\noutcome is you, Shia. Go. Lyn Shao\nnodded and looked at everyone. This will\nbe very dangerous, but we have no choice\nbut to do it. I have already arranged\nfor Tu Shawn by Chin and the others who\nare not very strong to leave quickly.\nWong Ming has done everything he can to\nutilize available resources, but there\nwill definitely be losses in some units.\nI just hope that you can all return\nsafely. Thank you for your concern,\nLord. Don't worry, brother. Shiao.\nFumodoro stealthily moved about,\ncarrying two Japanese swords, one long\nand one short, and occasionally using\nsecret techniques to observe his\nsurroundings. He was certain that Lyn\nSha was nearby, but the official area\nwas too vast, and the location Lyn Sha\nhad chosen was in a desolate wilderness.\nEven though he saw the dark clouds\npassing by the demonic tide, he could\nonly roughly confirm the direction. But\nthat was enough for him to encounter the\nFaceless Ones under Lin Xiao's command\nif it weren't for the complete level\nadvantage. Codor Fulma wouldn't have\nbeen confident of easily killing the\nFaceless One. The demon star Andrea is\nindeed quite skilled. If I hadn't\nambushed and killed the Faceless One\nwith a cany and quickly followed up with\na Kai slash, he would have spotted me in\nthe next second. Codor Fuma pondered\nsilently. The Faceless Ones are truly\nborn centuries, possessing telepathic\ncommunication capabilities, and even\ntheir sentry range is so vast. He had\nsearched hundreds of kilometers, but had\nnot encountered another faceless one or\nany other clues about Lin Sha. I will\nnot give up. Hey, Gamat. Just as he was\ntrying to cheer himself up, Fumako\nsuddenly heard a faint voice talking in\nthe distance. The atmosphere was low and\nsubdued as if they were having a secret\nconversation. Something's up. Fuma\nCodoro immediately perked up, formed\nhand seals, cast dozens of ninjutsu\nspells on himself, drew his katana, and\nslowly crept over to investigate. Upon\ngetting closer, Fumoro realized that\nthey were a group of level 70 or so\nnolles. Baka, that's not the target.\nFuma Codoro cursed under his breath and\nprepared to leave. Baka, not the target.\nHis own curses, however, rang out like\nthunder. The nullles moved swiftly and\naccurately with the lead wolf letting\nout a furious roar and firing wildly\ntowards the source of the sound.\nCodorofa throws out Kana in retaliation.\nAfter a fierce battle, the jackal was\neasily defeated and Codoruma only broke\nout in a light sweat, tearing a small\nsection of his clothing. What was that\nsound just now? Why was my voice\namplified? Fumoro continued his search\nand soon he smelled a different scent.\nWhen he went to investigate, he stepped\non a dead branch and was attacked by\nmore than 20 cannibals. After defeating\nthe cannibal, Codor Fuma sustained minor\ninjuries. Over the next few tens of\nminutes, Fuma Codoro encountered several\nmore waves of wild monsters that\ninexplicably discovered his presence.\nAfter the fierce battle, Codoruma was\npanting heavily and had sustained some\ninjuries. Baka, I've been exposed.\nSomeone's playing a trick on me. Chapter\n165 times almost up. Codor Fuma thought\nof when he sensed something was wrong\nwas to retreat. As a renowned ninja who\nhad been in the industry for many years,\nhe never took risks when he felt it was\ndangerous. As long as I escape, I'll\nhave plenty of opportunities to return\nwith other strong reinforcements to\ncontinue the search. Anyway, Lynn Sha\ncan't escape. If his Japanese portal\nhadn't been restricted in the Long Nan\nregion, he would have immediately opened\nit and escaped back. Fumo immediately\nset off, fleeing back the way he came.\nThe trees on both sides rushed past as\nhe pushed his movement technique to its\nlimit. Suddenly his footing gave way and\nCodoro Fumo was startled. Trap. Fuma.\nCodoro stepped into a deep pit and fell\nrapidly to the bottom where sharp\nweapons lay. The pit was wide and smooth\nand with nowhere to grab onto, Codoro\nFuma could only watch helplessly as he\nfell in and was pierced by a sharp\nweapon. With a poof, Fumodoro s figure\nappeared on an open ground dozens of\nmeters away, leaving only a straw doll\nin the deep pit. Damn it, there are even\npurely physical traps. Fumako cursed.\nHaving fought on the battlefield of all\nraces for many years, he had mostly\nencountered magic or skill-based traps.\nHis magic resistance and physical\ninstincts had long since adapted to\nthem. \"This was entirely my fault,\"\nCodorma thought to himself. From now on,\nI'll have to take you guys seriously.\nThen Codor Fuma quickly changed\ndirection and fled. When I get serious,\nno trap can fool me. Another section of\nrope was lightly touched by Fuma Codoro,\nwho immediately rolled away to dodge,\navoiding the range of the subsequent\ntrap attacks. A mere trifling skill.\nCodor Fuma could even feel smug. A dozen\nbearmen behind him, awakened by the\ntrap, glared angrily at him. Ninja art.\nInvisibility technique. Unwilling to\nwaste time and energy, the ninja\nimmediately used invisibility techniques\nto avoid the bear man. Holding his\nbreath and taking a detour. But after\nwalking only a few hundred meters, they\ntriggered another trap, waking up\nseveral king cobras. Fumoro drew his\nkatana and flashed past, slicing the\nking cobra into several pieces. Your\ntrap laying skills are quite good.\nHowever, as long as you set a trap, you\nwill leave a flaw. I have already\ndiscovered you. With a loud shout,\nFumako launched a surprise ninja attack,\ninstantly advancing hundreds of meters\nto spot a sneaky figure. Huh? The figure\nhad a beautiful face, a slender figure,\nand a curvaceous body. It was surrounded\nby only some green leaves, and a pair of\ntranslucent wings were slowly\nfluttering. A flower fairy. How could\nsuch a weak creature be the maker of a\ntrap? The flower fairy was startled by\nthe sudden attack of the wind demon\nCodoro and instinctively threw out\npoisonous seeds to retaliate. With a\ncasual swift movement, Codor Fuma\ncleaved the flower fairy in two, showing\nno mercy whatsoever, and blood\nsplattered everywhere. Uh, Yao Yao is\ndead. The flower fairy exploded on the\nspot, and Fumoro was splashed with a\ntrace of blood. The exploding flower\nfairy is just a flower fairy. The one\nwho's really lying in ambush for me is\nsomeone else. Codor Fumo once again used\nhis ninjutsu to charge forward only to\nfind himself in the territory of a tree\nspirit. A thousand-year-old tree spirit\nslowly opened its eyes and its vines\nsuddenly lunged forward. Fuma Codoro\ndodged and counterattacked in a sorry\nstate, spending quite a bit of time to\nkill the tree spirit. After all that\nback and forth, he hadn't found Lin\nXiao's trail and had instead exposed\nhimself. When he tried to escape back,\nhe was lured into the wilderness by\ntraps and flower fairies. And Fuma\nCodoro ser flared up. Baka, are you\nkidding me? Lyn Sha, come out and face\nyour death. Fight me like a man. What\nkind of genius lord only knows how to\nuse underhanded tactics? You can't\ndefeat me by just relying on monsters\nand traps. There is no monster in this\nwilderness that can defeat me. Before he\ncould finish speaking, Codor Fuma's foot\nslipped again, nearly falling into a new\ntrap. He quickly swung out his grappling\nhook and escaped. Then another wave of\nenraged monsters charged up and angrily\nengaged in battle with the ninjas who\nhad disturbed their rest. In the\ndistance, Ba, hidden beneath the forest\nwitch's cloak, held her breath in\ntension, only slowly wiping away her\nsweat. An hour later, Codor Fuma finally\nfigured out the ambush tactics and\npatterns. He was no longer troubled by\nthe outdated but surprisingly effective\nphysical traps, nor did he disturb the\nwild monsters anymore. As a result, his\nspeed increased significantly. A figure\nreappeared ahead and the faint sound of\nsinging drifted over. Fuma Codoro\ncautiously approached. He discovered\nthat they were actually a large group of\nflower fairies. The leading flower fairy\nwas playing an ancient musical\ninstrument and singing a ballot. The\nremaining flower fairies sat\ncross-legged on the ground, swaying\ntheir bodies to the rhythm of the song.\nWhat should have been a harmonious and\nnatural scene appeared somewhat eerie to\nCodor Fuma. Fuma Codoro Esatana was\ndripping with blood and his face was\nfull of murderous intent. These flower\nfairies must be related to Lin Sha. The\nfact that they dared to swagger in front\nof him now meant that there might be a\nnew trap. Use Ninjutsu. Fumako used his\naerial vision to survey his\nsurroundings, confirming there were no\nambushes. He then carefully prepared a\nstraw doll in his arms before slowly\napproaching. Once I wandered aimlessly\non the dark road, the breeze stings my\nsoul. I can't find my way. The flower\nfairy captain had already seen Fuma\nCodoro, but she was not afraid at all\nand continued to sing healing and warm\nsongs. Fuma Codoro&lt;unk&gt;s gaze turned\ncold, and with a flash of his blade, a\nflower fairy sitting and listening to\nmusic was decapitated. Baka, I'm giving\nyou one minute to tell me where Lin Sha\nis. Anyone who doesn't will end up like\nher. No flower fairy paid him any\nattention. He continued singing and\nswaying his body. A gentle breeze\nstinging my soul. I can't find my way.\nIt's&lt;unk&gt; almost time. Fumako said\ngrimly. The song continued. How many\ntears are needed to complete this\njourney of life. 10 9 8 7 3 2 1 Flower\nFairy. May I look forward to flying\ntogether in the distant sky to newly\ncreated beings? Baka Fuma Codoro stepped\nforward, a cold smile on his face, and\nbrandished his katana. One slash, the\nflower demon was killed. Another slash,\na flower fairy fell. Codoro Fuma slashed\nand killed flower fairies one after\nanother while his singing continued\nunabated. Life's journey is so long and\nI crave your smile to complete it. Baka\nFumakoro got carried away with the\nkilling and became covered in blood. In\nthe end, all the flower fairies were\nkilled and he came before the flower\nfairy squad leader. Are you still going\nto sing or not? The flower fairy squad\nleader, fearless and with I'll sing\nwritten all over her face, defiantly\nlooked at Fuma Codoro and sang, \"Life is\nsuch a journey, I crave your smile to\ncomplete it. Open the door of freedom\nfor me. Take my hand, new creation.\"\nWith a flash of light, Fuma Codoro\nfinished off the flower fairy squad\nleader and turned to leave. I am Fuma\nCodoro. Lyn Shiao, get out here right\nnow. The roar came from afar. Chapter\n166. Stopping Codoro Fuma at all costs.\nAfter slaughtering all the flower\nfairies, Fuma Codoro suddenly roared. He\ncouldn't stand those flower fairies\nseemingly bewitched, deathdeying\nattitude, stretching out their necks\nlike ducks for him to slaughter.\nFinally, the flower fairy captain looked\nat him strangely. Even though her life\nwas in his hands, she still had a smug\nlook on her face. This enraged Codor\nFuma, who couldn't help but roar out in\nanger. Bakayeru, these flower fairies\nare working without fear of death. This\nis a cult. You think your head will grow\nback after you cut it off? Fuma Codoro\nknew that as an assassin, he should\nretreat quickly if he was exposed before\neven getting close to his target. He\nshouldn't linger in the fight, much less\nroar and declare war. He shook his head,\nfeeling that his emotions had indeed\nbeen quite volatile today. Maintain the\noriginal plan. We will withdraw and\nreturn to take revenge another day. We\ncannot let our emotions control us\nanymore. Fuma Codoro turned to leave,\nhis resolve even stronger this time.\nHowever, as soon as I turned around, I\nheard a commotion behind me. A huge wave\nof monsters surged toward Fuma Codoro s\nlocation. Flower fairy. It's the flower\nfair's flesh and blood that attracted\nthe predators in the wilderness. Codor\nFuma understood the reason. He quickly\nused ninjutsu to wash himself clean and\nconceal his scent and form. He decided\nto bypass the monster horde and avoid\nunnecessary battles. However, although\nhis idea was good, some people prevented\nhim from having his way. A pebble struck\nFuma Codoro precisely, leaving a strong\naura of flower fairy flesh and blood on\nhis body. Um, monsters swarmed in, but\nCodor Fuma used his ninjutsu to charge\nleft and right, slaying them. In the\nheat of the battle, Codor Fuma suddenly\nleft a clone behind, then teleported to\nthe spot where he had thrown the pebble\nand slashed down with his sword. when a\nloud crash was heard and the knife was\nblocked. Fumako saw a burly man nearly 2\nm tall with a broad back and thick waist\ncovered in elaborate iron armor. Even\nhis face was covered with an iron mask.\nThe burly man held a giant blade more\nthan 3 m long. The blade gleaming\ncoldly. It was with this blade that he\nhad just caught his own attack. was\nknocked back more than 10 steps by a\nsingle blow from Fumoro before he\nfinally stopped and then immediately\ncharged out again. That's interesting.\nFumodoro watched helplessly as the burly\nman charged towards him, his giant blade\nslashing down on him. Clang. He raised\nhis Japanese sword and easily blocked\nthe strong man's full force attack.\nThat's not bad. Probably around level 50\nor 60 in terms of strength, but it's\nstill not enough against me. Before he\ncould finish speaking, the burly man\nswiftly swung his sword down again.\nFumodoro hastily drew his short Japanese\nsword to block the attack. When Baka,\nyour skills are shameless. Which hero of\nLin Sha are you? I am merely a soldier.\nThe burly man spoke in a deep booming\nvoice, his long-handled broadsword\nslashing incessantly. Each strike\nsending sparks flying everywhere. Little\nsoldier, do you think I'm an idiot or\nhas my brain gone mad from listening to\ntoo much music? Fumo was furious.\nDespite the level difference, he was\nstill able to kill the monsters in no\ntime. Even though he was facing the Modo\nDao Iron Guard in front of him and\nseveral wild monsters chasing after him,\nhe then struck the Mod Dao Iron Guard\nwith a cany. The armor of the burly man\nin front of him was split open,\nrevealing another layer of chain mail\nunderneath, and the cany only went in\nhalfway before getting stuck. It's\nuseless. No amount of armor can help\nagainst absolute power. Although I admit\nyou're tough, Fuma Codoro narrowed his\neyes. Fire release. Great fireball\ntechnique. A sudden burst of flames\nerupted from the burly man's body,\ncausing him to sway before collapsing\nheavily to the ground. A humble man\nfighting for his country has no regrets\neven in death. The strong man died.\nOomph. He can be considered a samurai.\nIf your level weren't so low, you might\nbe able to fight me. Fuma Codoro planned\nto leave with a whoosh. A crossbow bolt\nshot out, but Codor Fuma dodged it by\ntilting his head. He immediately spotted\nhis target. Another soldier dressed like\na tin can. Are all of Lin Xiao's men\nthis cowardly? They only dare to hide\nbehind their armor. Fuma Codoro rushed\nout, changing his form to dodge the\ncrossbow bolts three times in a row.\nYou're dead once I get close. One strike\nthrough the wind. What? Despicable.\nFumodoro almost fell into the trap\nagain. It turns out that Lyn Xiao's\npeople never intended to duel him.\nWhoosh! The arrow flew past and the\nninja in midair barely managed to adjust\nhis body, but was still hit in the arm\nby the crossbow bolt and blood\nsplattered. Ninja art damage transfer.\nFumodoro transferred the damage directly\nto the head of a monster chasing him and\nthe monster died instantly lying face\nup. Having escaped the trap, Fumako\nfinally reached the tin can. Die you\ncoward. Bang. What? Suddenly, the man in\nthe tin can pulled out a horizontal\nknife and actually caught the blow he\nwas about to receive. Codor Fuma also\ncarefully examined the man. Are you Lin\nXiao's hero? The lowly are merely\nsoldiers. Fuma Codoro shook his head,\npicked up his katana, and once again\nengaged the tin can in battle. Less than\n30 seconds later, the ninja suddenly\nstabbed a shuriken through the gap in\nthe tin can's eye, and the tin can fell\nto the ground dead without uttering a\nsound. They can be considered a\nformidable unit. Codorofa was about to\nleave. Another arrow came flying. Will\nthis ever end? On the other end was a\nphantom shooter wearing overalls.\nWearing overalls is a weird trend you\nbrought. Women in my great Japan are\nwearing them. Damn it. Wearing that\nstuff is so inconvenient. Oh no, it's so\nunattractive. NO Riri Fuma Codoro\nswiftly and decisively defeated the\nphantom archer. I can't let them lead me\nby the nose anymore. I have to leave\nimmediately. Codor Fuma felt his\nphysical strength was declining\ndrastically. His substitute straw doll,\nlife-saving tools, and ninjutsu reserves\nwere almost all used up in the few hours\nof fighting wild monsters and escaping\ntraps. But then another wave of monsters\nblocked his path. As Codorum was about\nto leave with his woodrelease clone, he\nturned a corner and was blocked by two\nburly men with bare arms, each wielding\na long spear. Without a word, the man\nwith the long spear thrust forward while\nFumodoro threw a canai that slashed both\nof their arms. The poison causing them\nto collapse instantly. Using a single\nsword to break a spear is too\ntroublesome, but I'm an expert in using\npoison. The sound of hooves clattered as\nseveral cavalrymen spotted Codoro Fuma\nand immediately fired. Fuma Codoro\nreleased his clones for close combat and\nwithin minutes both he and his clones\nperished. These troops are only around\nlevel 50, right? Their strength is\nalmost level 60. What's wrong with me?\nLyn Sha has only been in the official\nzone for a short time. How come he has\nlevel 60 troops? Could it be that he has\npowerful reinforcements and that's not\nworking? My head is getting dizzy.\nFumakodoro stumbled and fled. Whenever\nhe killed a monster in front of him and\nprepared to speed up, there was always\nan armored greatswordsman, a\ncrossbowman, a knight, or a barbarian\nspearman blocking his way. Along with\nthem came traps that were difficult to\nguard against. Fuma Codoro could only\nfight with all his might to kill the\nenemy. But his head was getting dizzier\nand dizzier, and finally he spat out a\nmouthful of blood. Baka, it's a flower\ndemon. I've been poisoned by the flower\ndemon. That song is poisonous. The song\nitself isn't poisonous. The poison is\nthe drug that causes trapping, a type of\ndrug used to induce convulsions. A voice\ndrifted from afar. Chapter 167. Lynn Sha\nappears. A sword comes from the east. As\nthe voice faded, a figure slowly\nappeared. It was Lin Sha. He was dressed\nin dark armor, holding a long sword. He\nwas tall and slender with a straight\nposture and a handsome sculpted face.\nBut at this moment, his face only showed\nsorrow and resentment. On either side of\nhim followed two generals, one in gold\nand one in silver, both clad in armor.\nThe golden armored general had a face\nlike jade, fair skin, and clear\nmajestic and awe inspiring. The silver\narmored general was a female warrior\ndraped in a bright red cloak exuding a\nheroic and unparalleled beauty. Thought\nFumodoro. Lyn Shiao, it really is you.\nYou actually dare to show up? Fumodoro\nsneered calmly stood up and watched Lin\nSha slowly approach. You wanted to kill\nme and here I am. Lyn Sha said slowly,\nhis face cold. Anyway, even if a highle\nninja like you tracks me down, I can't\nescape, can I? Fumauro burst into\nlaughter, feeling extremely pleased. The\nfrustration of being toyed with by Lyn\nSha for the past few hours was swept\naway. You do have some self-awareness,\nLyn Sha. When you humiliated Japan and\nKenzo Dohurra, the outcome was already\npredetermined. I'll find you sooner or\nlater. You can hide today, but you can't\nhide tomorrow. Come on, fight me like a\nreal man, and I'll give you a glorious\ndeath. Glory. Duel? Is the duel you're\ntalking about fair? Lyn Sha slowly said,\n\"I'm only level 43.\" Haha, young man.\nThere's no such thing as fairness in\nthis world. You're level 43. I'm level\n85. Just wait. You're only level 43. So,\nyour greatsword units, cavalry archers,\narmored infantry, and spearmen are all\naround level 40. Lynh Xiao's face was so\ndark it looked like it was about to drip\nwater. Exactly. Such combat power at\nlevel 43. I thought it was an epic unit\nat level 50 or 60. Fumodoro was shocked\nfor a second. Then his expression turned\nextremely dangerous and sinister. He\nmuttered to himself. This young man is\nincredibly strong and his troops are\nunexpectedly powerful. My previous\nestimate was wrong. I reckon he has\nlegendary troops under his command. Five\nlegendary unit types. Lyn Sha is only in\nhis 40s and he already has five\nlegendary unit types. This child must\nnot be allowed to live. What are you\nmuttering to yourself over there? Lyn\nShao said coldly. Have you forgotten\nwhat I just said? Fumakuro was taken\naback. Why was he talking to himself? He\nhad always thought that what he was\nthinking in his heart had turned into\ntalking to himself. Then another wave of\ndizziness hit. Oh no, it's poison. Baka\nLyn Shao, you are despicable and\nshameless. You actually poison me. If\nyou have the guts, fight me face to\nface. What kind of fairness is this?\nPoisoning me like this. Huh? Old people,\nthere's no fairness in this world. Lyn\nSha returned the words to Fuma Codoro\nverbatim. The ninja snorted coldly,\nenduring his physical discomfort. When\nexactly did you poison me? Why did I get\ninfected even with my high poison\nresistance? It's very simple. It's when\nyou killed the flower fairy, Lynn Shiao\nsaid coldly. All the flower fairies have\ningested the entangling poison, a highly\npoisonous substance that has entered\ntheir bloodstream. When you kill them,\nthe poison will be sprayed onto you.\nWhat? If I don't kill them, they're\ndoomed anyway. Of course, Lyn Sha said\nfrankly, Baka, you pervert. You used\nyour own men as bait to poison me. I\ndare not accept such praise. Compared to\nyou who kill your own people just to win\nthe resource race, you are still\nslightly inferior. Lyn Shao said, \"My\ntroops, my Mod Dao iron guards, divine\narm archers, White Spear soldiers, great\nHan Champion cavalry, and Guan Ning iron\ncavalry all sacrificed themselves for\nthe greater good. I will settle this\nscore with you sooner or later.\" What a\nstrange name. Is this Lyn Xiao's real\nname? Aren't you afraid I'll reveal it\nby saying this name? Don't worry. The\ndead can't talk. You call me a dead man.\nCome at me if you dare, you idiot.\nCodorofa leaped up and unleashed a swift\nI eye slash at Lyn Shao. The strike\nmissed its mark. Lyn Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s figure\nstood much further away from him. It was\npoison. The poison made me lose my sense\nof distance. Without giving Fuma Codoro\ntime to think, Lyn Shao waved his hand,\nand more than a dozen archers appeared,\nraising their giant crossbows and firing\na volley. Fuma Cottoaro used ninjutsu to\ndodge, further depleting his already\nlimited chakra energy. Ahead, a dozen or\nso iron guards with long swords formed a\nhuman wall to block codoruma s attack\nroute. To the side, a dozen or so white\npole spearmen thrust their spears to\nblock codoruma as flanks. The sound of\nhooves came from behind again, and the\nGuan Ning cavalry opened fire\nimmediately. The gunpowder struck the\nninja, sending a cloud of blood mist\nflying. Fumako used a forbidden\ntechnique to kill three mo Dao iron\nguards, break through the human wall,\nand rush towards Lyn Shao. Generals, one\nwith gold and one with silver, attacked\ntogether with lightning speed. Fumodoro\nsuddenly stopped, turned around, and\nslashed twice, one to the left and one\nto the right, knocking the two generals\naway. Now that only Lin Sha was standing\nin front of him, Fuma Codoro revealed a\nsmug smile. Just then, Lyn Shao raised\nhis hand and unleashed a sword strike.\nThis sword strike was like the Milky Way\npouring down, like countless stars\ndescending upon the earth. This sword\nstrike came rushing towards us like a\nmeteor streaking across the sky or a\nblazing sun falling. A sword comes from\nthe east. Fuma Codoro dodged and\nattacked simultaneously, pushing his\nmovement technique to its limit. I never\nexpected that the most powerful one here\nwould be Lin Shia. You little rascal.\nThat sword strike was impressive enough,\nbut your level is too low. You still\ncan't hurt me. While still in midair,\nthe poison took effect again. He coughed\nup a mouthful of black blood, felt the\nworld spin, and plummeted straight down.\nNinja art soul burning technique. Codor\nFuma activated his secret technique once\nagain. As a renowned highle ninja, he\nstill had a way to save his life. Go to\nhell, Lynsha. The secret technique has a\nlimited time limit, and Fuma Codoro\nplanned to finish the battle quickly.\nBut at this moment, Lyn Shao raised his\nhand again and assumed the starting\nstance of the sword strike from before.\nFumako was startled and prepared to\ndodge again. Sure enough, a dazzling\nsword strike appeared once again,\npiercing right through Fuma Codoro. How\nis that possible? Fuma Codoro muttered\nto himself as his body shattered into\nseveral pieces and exploded. Then a new\nfigure appeared from not far away,\nspitting out several mouthfuls of black\nblood and tried to run away without\nlooking back. The sword light flashed\nagain, following closely behind Fumako.\nWhen did Lin Sha become so amazing? Huh?\nIt's you, the mysterious hero in white.\nFumako yelled that he was now seriously\ninjured, had used up all his life-saving\nand survival items, and had also used up\nhis stand. Moreover, even though he used\na substitute, Lyn Xiao's so-called\ndeadly poison still clung to him, making\nhim dizzy and causing his fighting\nability to drop drastically once again.\nHis limbs also began to twitch. This\npoison actually acted on the nervous\nsystem first and then on the muscles.\nFacing this whiteclad hero who could\nkill the sword saint e fumodoro believed\nthat he currently heavily injured had no\nchance of winning. Chapter 168 level 43\nversus level 85 victory. Fumako threw\nout a smoke bomb and changed direction\nto sneak away. But in just a moment, his\nstealth was exposed, and he was located\nagain, stained with a blood red mark.\nBaka, he lowered his head and charged\nforward, only to be blocked by a wall of\nmo Dao iron guards. Get out of the way.\nAfter several surprise attacks, even the\nseriously injured Fumodoro couldn't\nbreak through the defenses of the Emo\nDao iron guard. He used his speed to\nchange direction and encountered another\nswordsman dressed similarly to the\nwhiteclad hero. The swordsman swiftly\ndrew his sword and exchanged several\nblows with Fumakodoro. The whiteclad\nhero caught up and Fumakodoro, unable to\nkill the swordsman for the time being,\nhad no choice but to continue his\nescape. An arrow flew in and pierced\nFuma Codoro s shoulder. He no longer had\nthe strength to use damage transfer.\nBang! Another gunshot rang out, the\nthree-eyed musket splattering directly\nat the ninja. He tried his best to dodge\nto the side, then suddenly jumped up,\nleaping onto the horse and knocking the\nGuan Ning cavalry down. He then jumped\nonto the horse himself. Fumodoro grabbed\nthe reigns and prepared to leave on the\nGuan Ning iron cavalry's horse. At that\nmoment, the knight who had fallen to the\nground got up, drew his long sword, and\ncut off his beloved horse's leg with one\nstroke. Damn it. Fuma Codoro shot a\nshuriken which pierced the eye of a Guan\nNing cavalryman. The knight, in a fit of\nrage, continued to charge forward,\nbrandishing his long sword. But after\ntaking two steps, his face turned purple\nand he collapsed and died. Bang! Bang! A\nsmall squad of Guan Ning cavalry\nappeared and opened fire simultaneously.\nThe three-eyed musketss rained down on\nthe corpses of the ninja and his\ncomrades behind him, firing with a\nseries of crackling sounds. Fumoto was\nhit by more than a dozen bullets,\nspitting out black blood. He threw out\nseveral shuriken, but the Guan Ning\ncavalry opposite him neither dodged nor\navoided them. They raised their arms to\nprotect their faces and charged forward\nfearlessly with their spears. Clang,\nclang, clang. Several knights fell from\ntheir horses, and the remaining knights\nlances pierced half an inch into the\nbody of Fumodoro before stopping. Fumako\nstruck several knights, their blood\nsplattering everywhere. The remaining\nknights continued to wield their heavy\nthree-eyed musketss, slamming them down\non Fumao. The sound of arrows cutting\nthrough the air came from afar. The\narchers with divine crossbows in the\ndistance had already locked onto the\nenemy who was fighting with the Guan\nNing iron cavalry and kept firing\ncrossbow bolts. The ninja was hit by\nseveral arrows in just a moment. Baka\nFumodoro still had his last bit of\nstrength left. He used his secret\ntechnique again and with a loud bang\nsent all the Guan Ning cavalry in front\nof him flying. Pay Min finally arrived,\nraising his hand to unleash a streak of\nlight that shot straight toward the\nninja. Flash, flash. Codor Fuma\nfrantically urged his consciousness, but\nhe was still pierced by the streak of\nlight and half of his arm was neatly\nsevered off. Black blood gushed out and\nFuma Codoro used the blood as a catalyst\nto unleash blood escape. Two swordsmen\narrived, their swords flashing, piercing\nthrough Fuma Codoro s body, but he had\nalready escaped. The swordsman thrust at\nthe flowing black blood, but it had no\neffect. Black blood quickly burrowed\ninto the ground about to escape. Just\nbecause I used sword comes from the east\ndoesn't mean I only have one sword\ntechnique. Pay Min sneered. Japanese\nprepare to die. Sacrifice oneself to\nbreak through thoughts is activated.\nBurning life force using lost essence as\na catalyst enhances one's combat power.\nattacks paying men has inflicted on the\nenemy, causing massive damage. As soon\nas the sacrifice to break mind was\nactivated, the body of Fumako on the\nground and the black blood on the ground\nimmediately exploded into a burst of\nlight. Boom! Fumako was blasted out in a\nsorry state covered in blood with one\narm severed, one leg blown off and deep\nbone revealing wounds on his abdomen and\nchest where his internal organs already\nblackened could be vaguely seen. He no\nlonger had the strength to stand up. All\naround the MO Dao iron guards, white\npole spear soldiers, Guan Ning iron\ncavalry, great Han Champion cavalry,\ndivine arm archers, and unnamed\nswordsmen were all on high alert and\nslowly surrounded them. Pay men dressed\nin white walked at the very front. You\nyou all despicable. I've been weakened\ntoo much by the poison. Otherwise, how\ncould a group of you level 40s be able\nto deal with me? Fumako said haltingly,\n\"You Chinese are so despicable and\nshameless. I would rather die than\nsubmit to you. I hate this attitude of\nliving a mundane life the most.\" Lyn\nShao slowly walked over with Hortubing\nand Chin Leongyu. A simple life? Fumako\nasked puzzled. \"I'm just insulting you\nJapanese. You keep calling me China so I\ncan't insult your lives.\" Lyn Sha spat.\nYou call us despicable, but aren't you\ndespicable when you slaughter your own\nkind just to win? You can't win, so you\nflip the table. Isn't it despicable to\nsend an 85th level ninja to deal with a\nlord who has just entered the official\nzone? You say, \"I'm despicable for using\npoison, but wasn't it despicable of you\nto kill my soldiers with poison\nshurikens?\" Lynho&lt;unk&gt;s face had never\nbeen so furious before. His handsome\nfeatures were distorted with rage. He\nsaid coldly. Do you know that my troops\nhave never suffered any losses? To deal\nwith you, an 85th level ninja lord. They\nhave fought bravely and relentlessly,\nready to die for you. They can only see\nthe mistakes of others, but not their\nown crimes. They have small courtesy,\nbut no sense of righteousness. They bow\npolitely to everyone they meet, claiming\nto be the most courteous. Yet they\nignore the huge incident of the\nFukushima leak and allow sewage to be\ndischarged into the world. Is it really\nenough to just bow and apologize when\nsomething goes wrong and say, \"I'm sorry\nto solve everything.\" Fukushima leaked.\nFumako felt like he couldn't understand\nLinia's words. Don't you dare interfere.\nLynn Shiao roared. Today, you will pay\nfor my brother's lives. A sword came\nfrom the east and thrust forward, but\nCodoro Fuma desperately turned his body\nto avoid a fatal blow. Huh? Fuma Codoro\nwas about to mock Lin Sha. The drug took\neffect, causing him excruciating pain\nthat made his whole body convulse. You\nshould be glad that I am far more\nmerciful than you. I could have severed\nyour tendons and let the poison kill you\nslowly. Codor Fuma's eyes. As long as he\nhad a moment to catch his breath, he\nstill had a chance. But I won't leave\nmyself with any hidden dangers. Lynn\nShiao said, \"I not only want to watch\nyou die, but I also want to watch you be\nreduced to ashes and use your ashes as\nfertilizer for flower fairies. I also\nwant to invite a wizard to chant a\nreququum for you.\" Codoruma sis, you how\ncruel you are. Thank you for the\ncompliment. Pay Min and several\nswordsmen simultaneously unleashed a\nsword strike from the east. The iron\nguards wielded their long-handled swords\nand the white pole spearman. The archers\nunleashed a volley of fire. The Guan\nNing cavalry opened fire simultaneously.\nThere were also the Han Dynasty champion\ncavalry and the Phantom Archer drawing\ntheir bows and shooting arrows. Fuma\nCodoro instantly coughed up blood and\nwas dismembered beyond any hope of\nsurvival. Lyn Xiao's expression did not\nsoften in the slightest. Everyone on\nhigh alert. Send a flower fairy to loot\nthe bag and disinfect everything found.\nWhite pole soldiers and moa soldiers,\nkeep poking holes in his corpse. Poke\nhis body into a civ, then burn it. I'll\njust watch it turn to ashes. Don't spare\nthe land stained with blood. Burn it\nall. Liao's face was ashen as he watched\nthe soldiers operate. He saw the ninja's\ncorpse seemed to twitch, filled with\nresentment. Finally. Ding. You have\ndefeated the player from the Shikoku\nregion. Codor Fuma, what you receive?\nLyn Sha sneered. You little brat. The\nsystem didn't give any notification\nsound. How could I not know you weren't\ncompletely dead? Chapter 1 169 postwar\nsummary. A heavy price. Deaths. 11 iron\nguards with mo Dao. Six archers with\ndivine arms. 12 iron cavalry of Guan\nNing. 18 champion cavalry of the great\nHan. 23 white-shaped spearmen, 13\nphantom archers, one faceless one, all\nflower fairies. \"Even if the flower\nfairy didn't die,\" Lin Sha said, waving\nhis hand. \"Yes,\" Wong Ming said in a low\nvoice. \"The number of wounded is about\nthree times that of the dead. But even\nthe seriously wounded are slowly\nrecovering after entering the territory\nthanks to the territo's healing effects.\nYes, only the dead. The wounded can\nrecover and severed limbs can grow back.\nThat's the advantage of the golden\nlegend Lord&lt;unk&gt;'s Mansion, Lyn Sha\nsaid. But we still suffered heavy losses\nand learned a painful lesson. It was\nalready the second day after the great\nbattle, but Lyn Sha still couldn't\nforget his fight with Fumakoro. Level 43\nversus Level 85, and not just any level\n85. Lyn Sha had already checked as soon\nas he returned. Fuma Codoro was a\nwell-known ninja in Japan, the founder\nof the Fuma school and one of the four\ngreat ninjas of Japan. This is a top\ntier ninja lord, possessing countless\nmagical artifacts, secret techniques,\nand extremely rich combat experience. In\norder to keep him in the dark and\nprevent his location from being exposed,\nLin Sha mobilized his entire army and\nused every means at his disposal, all\nunder Wong Ming's scheme. First, there's\nBaoi, Lin Ziao's current partner and\nlover, whom he has to personally\nintervene with. Of the necromancer orb,\nthe mythical level Baoi was over level\n40 with all her attributes higher than\nPay Mins. But she was, after all, a weak\nwoman with absolutely no combat\nexperience. Ba's mythical skill,\npeerless demoness, allows her to\ninfluence fate. She can amplify, shrink,\nand transfer the effects of specific\nskills. Skills that are too powerful\ncannot be manipulated. So after she put\non the forest witch's cloak, her\nconcealment and invisibility skills\nreached Srank and even Fumodoro couldn't\nfind her. She followed Fumako closely,\nusing her skills to expose him,\nattracting monsters to gang up on him\nand depleting his stamina and endurance.\nWhen Lynn Shiao chose his landing spot,\nthe monsters in this area were in too\npowerful. So there was no possibility\nthat they could directly and severely\ninjure Fumakoto. During this time, the\nWhite Spearman and Ding Lays dwarf\nminers quickly dug various traps. The\nWhite Spearman possess extensive\nexperience in mountain warfare and have\ninherited the pure physical traps of\nancient China, while the dwarf miners\nexcel at digging tunnels. The two groups\nwork hard to dig and set traps, creating\nthe second layer of obstacles for\nFumakoto. Then there are the flower\nfairies. These free-spirited daredevils\nare skilled in using poison, but their\npoison is basically ineffective against\nninjas who are experts in using poison.\nNot to mention the level difference of\nmore than 40 levels. So Lynn Sha made\nall the flower fairies take the drug\nthat caused the poison to enter their\nbloodstream. and through suicide they\nwould transfer the poison to Fuma\nCodoro. Ordinary poisons have no effect\non Codor Fuma but the tethering poison\ndeveloped by Emperor Taong of Song is\ndifferent. As long as the problem of\npoisoning can be solved and the poison\nis applied to him, Codorofa will\ndefinitely be poisoned. However, in the\nbattlefield of myriad races, even the\nS-rank poison, the chi- trapping poison\nis greatly diminished in effectiveness\nin the face of the huge level\ndifference. Lyn Sha was also prepared\nfor this. If S-rank poison could\ndominate the world, then a novice lord\ncould kill a god king of the first level\nwith poison, and he wouldn't need to\nwork hard to level up. The flower\nfairies had no complaints about Lin Sha\ns arrangements. They even came up with a\nbizarre scene of a cult leader singing\nwhich enraged Codoruma causing him to\nbecome infected with even more toxins.\nThe flower fairy actually found this\nnovel way of dying quite exciting. The\nnewly planted flower fairy captain\nlaughed and said that if Fuma Codoro was\nstill alive, she would like to do it\nagain and let this ninja see what a real\nnew creator is. Poison greatly weakened\nCodor Fuma as combat power and the\ncombined effects of monsters and traps\nallowed Lin Xiao's team to fight him.\nOnce he realizes he's fallen into a\ntrap, Fuma Codoro might choose to\nretreat. At that point, no one can stop\nhim and he'll have to rely on his own\ntroops to hold the line. The Mod Dao\niron guards stepped forward. They drove\naway and lured wild monsters to form an\nencirclement while forming a human wall\nto surround and intercept the desperate\nninja. One word, waste time. This\ndepletes Codoro Fuma s life-saving\nmethods and exhaust his stamina,\nallowing the poison to penetrate deeper\ninto his body. However, the difference\nof more than 40 levels made battle\nlosses inevitable. In the end, after\npaying a heavy price, Lin Shao first\ndrew the attention of Fuma Codoro and\nPay Min then launched a sneak attack\nfrom behind. With their combined\nefforts, they killed the strongest enemy\nLin Sha had ever encountered. A level 43\nteam killed a top tier level 85 lord. I\ndon't know if anyone will be able to do\nit in the future, but it is\nunprecedented. Lyn Xiao's face was\ngloomy as he slowly said, \"But I can't\nbe happy. Every single soldier in the\nChinese army is my brother, the apple of\nmy eye. They should be making great\ncontributions on the battlefield of all\nraces and bringing glory to China. They\nsacrificed themselves in vain because of\nthe treachery and cunning of the\nJapanese. \"My lord, you have done very\nwell. There is no genius in this era who\ncan compare with you,\" Wong Ming said,\nstanding beside him. \"But I can do\nbetter, can I?\" Lyn Shao suddenly stood\nup and looked at the soldiers in the war\nhall. We have encountered a formidable\nenemy, but the problems that have been\nexposed are objectively real. If we get\ncaught out by Codor Fuma this time,\nwe'll get caught out by another expert\nnext time. Lyn Shiao said loudly. The\niron guards of the Mod Dao are fierce\nwarriors who are clad in armor and wield\nsharp weapons. Even three layers of iron\narmor could not stop the sharp blade of\nFuma Codoro. Oh Yi, what are your\nthoughts? Oh, Yzi quickly stepped\nforward, bowed, and said,\"Lord, the\nbright armor rewarded by the god system\nis under development and will be\ncompleted within 3 days.\" Lyn Sha slowly\nshook his head, \"Not enough. The rewards\nfor waiting for the Warh Hall to issue\nmissions are far from enough. The first\nlayer can be upgraded from fish scale\narmor to bright armor, doubling the\ndefense. The second layer can also be\nupgraded. We can upgrade to meteor chain\narmor using materials unique to the\nbattlefield of 10,000 races. Can you do\nit? O Yi paused for a few seconds, then\nslowly said, \"I am 80% confident.\" \"Very\ngood,\" Lyn Sha continued. The archer's\neyelids under his helmet were also hit\nby a shuriken from Codor Fuma. \"I\nthought of a material, Shintai crystal\nfrom the battlefield of 10,000 races.\nIt's transparent and has a hardness and\ntoughness comparable to Shintai. Think\nof a way to make this into goggles.\nEquip the archers with the divine arm\narcher first and then extend a program\nto all Chinese military units. Yes, the\nwhite shafted spearmen wore breastplates\nand wrist guards, but their arms were\nbare. I asked Leang Yu, and he said it\nwas because they often had to climb\nmountain walls, so they couldn't wear\nheavy armor that would restrict their\nmovement. Lynn Sha continued, \"I'll\nprovide you with some animal hides so\nyou can experiment and have the white\nspearmen wear a layer of tough leather\narmor underneath to increase their\ndefensive capabilities.\" Yes. In\naddition, chapter 1 70 hugging the\nthigh, chrysanthemum, and sword. Lyn Sha\nthrew out one idea after another,\narranging for O Yi to research and test\nthem. O Yzi's eyes grew brighter and\nbrighter. After all, he was a legendary\nhero and a master blacksmith. The\nchallenging task given by the lord\nrekindled his competitive spirit. That\nconcludes the equipment upgrades, Lynsha\nsaid. But no matter what, the most\nimportant thing is still hierarchy.\nWithout hierarchy, everything is just\nempty talk. Lyn Sha raised his hand and\nwaved it, and the huge sand table in the\nwar hall was updated again. Lyn Sha\nasked Baoi to bring out a pile of\npebbles and place them at various points\non the huge sand table. I'll use pebbles\ninstead of monsters. Lyn Sha said, \"I'll\nskip the quality part since everyone\nhere is of gold legendary quality, and\nthe monsters here, no matter how high\ntheir quality, won't exceed gold\nlegendary.\" The green stones are the\nmonster spots where the level is below\n50, and they pose no threat to you.\nYellow stones indicate monster spawn\npoints with levels between 50 and 60,\nwhile red stones indicate monster spawn\npoints with levels between 60 and 70.\nBlack stones indicate the most dangerous\nmonster spots, which are not advisable\nto challenge at this time. White stones\nrepresent nests or gathering places of\nmonsters with a population of more than\n500. While Baoi was still arranging the\nstones, Lin Shao said. Next, Wong Ming\nwill take charge of the overall\narrangements, dispersing and\nreorganizing the various troop types to\nform teams. You will be divided into\ndozens of teams. Some will stay behind\nto guard the territory and take turns on\nduty, while the other teams will go out\nto hunt monsters, cooperate in combat,\nand fight on multiple fronts. Quickly,\nimmediately go and level up. Lyn Shao\nsaid, \"As long as the level is raised\nwith the abilities of our Chinese\nsoldiers and heroes, we will be\ninvincible. We will never again be\noppressed by class differences.\"\n\"Everyone, did you understand?\"\n\"Understood!\" the soldiers shouted in\nunison. \"I, Lyn Sha, will make those who\noffend China pay the price.\" Some\nsoldiers were already moved to tears by\nthe tragic scene. Their lord had just\naccomplished an unprecedented feat,\ndefeating a top tier lord more than 40\nlevels above him. But he was feeling\ndepressed and lost. The reason is simply\nbecause some of our Chinese soldiers\nhave lost their brothers. The lord\nburied his brothers and immediately\nreturned to his territory where he\npondered all night. The next day, the\nlord immediately dispatched his top\nblacksmith who offered over a dozen\nsuggestions for improvement. It's also\nthat these Chinese soldiers can be less\ninjured. To help them level up quickly,\nthe Lord even used a god-like\nperspective to memorize information on\nall the monsters in the vicinity,\ndistinguishing them by color on a giant\nsandbox and arranging them one by one.\nLord, you truly value these Chinese\nsoldiers and treat them like brothers.\nLyn Xiao's extensive knowledge,\nexceptional memory, and leadership\nqualities further impressed them. After\nthe meeting, only Baoi remained by Lin\nXiao's side. Your efforts alone are not\nenough. Lyn Shiao murmured. I'm really\nstupid. I can improve myself. I have\npowerful backers. Why wouldn't I use\nthem? If the Japanese government sends\nan 85th level ninja, they will send a\nsecond, even stronger assassin. My aunt\nDugu will definitely not let a genius\nlike me who is ties to ancient demons\ndie like this. So, let her send\nbodyguards to protect me. It would be\nunreasonable not to use connections. It\ndoesn't fit my genius persona. Lynn\nShiao immediately decided to contact\nDuga Nonwang and request her majesty the\nqueen to provide him with some powerful\nbodyguards, which would greatly reduce\nhis future pressure. Of course, you only\nneed to protect yourself for a period of\ntime when you can't handle things on\nyour own. For other things, like hunting\nand exploring, you should do it\nyourself. This time it was a level over\n40 above me. Next time it'll be a level\n100 lord. Even if my entire army is\nwiped out, I still won't be able to win.\nAnd among the people I've messed with is\na level 100 lord. Huawei, the leader of\nthe celestial beings. You beat up the\nyoung ones. Now it's the older one's\nturn. I also need to find an older one\nto back me up. Huh? I don't have the ID\nnumber of the dragon summer domain lord.\nThen I can only call my old squad leader\nand asked her to think of a solution or\ngive me her majesty the queen's number\ndirectly. Lynn Sha opened the\ncommunication page and dialed Dugu\nXiaoan. However, the call could not be\nconnected. What happened? Very good.\nYour talent is being stimulated at an\nincreasingly higher level. Dugu Nanuang\nnodded approvingly and said, \"Come to me\nonce a week from now on. I will\npersonally train you for 2 hours and I\nwill provide the talismans for your\nround trip. You have such great talent.\nIt would be a real shame not to make\ngood use of it. Never let love and\nromance delay your cultivation progress.\nLove and romance. Dugu Jalon, who had\njust put away the Thai sword, looked on\nin astonishment across from Dugu\nNanuang. She wore a light purple robe\nand had a sword at her waist. She looked\nethereal and stood proudly. But when she\nheard her aunt's words, her usually\npretty and aloof face showed a very\nvivid expression. Well, I'm just\nreminding you that there is no man in\nthe entire blue star realm who is worthy\nof my jaanon. Dugu Nanuang smiled\nslightly. What she had just said was\njust a joke. Auntie, you're the one\nwho's talking to me. But why don't you\never mention your own marriage? Dugu\nJaolon&lt;unk&gt;s eyes flashed with a cunning\nlight. After training and in private,\nshe and her aunt were very close and she\neven dared to joke about the lord of\nLangsha domain. Me as the domain lord, I\nworry myself sick over the affairs of\nthe dragon summer domain every day.\nBesides, my identity is sensitive and\nany man who gets close to me. Dugu Jalon\nsneered. Most of them don't have good\nintentions. The two stunning beauties\nexchanged a glance and involuntarily\nshook their heads. Then he smiled\nknowingly. All right, you should go back\nnow. Lord of the domain. Lord Jabbron\nrequests an audience, someone announced\nfrom outside the door. All right, you\ncan come with me to see Khalil Jabbron\nand see what he has to do today. The\ngatekeeper sounded quite anxious. Dugu\nNanuang exhaled a deep breath. The\nrelaxed and intimate feeling she had\njust experienced with Dugu Jelon\nvanished instantly, replaced by an aura\nof noble majesty that was neither\nswaying nor inviable. The two opened the\ndoor and entered the reception room. The\ntall, white-haired old man, Khalil\nJabbron, with a high nose, blue eyes,\nand a full head of white hair, looked\nsomewhat anxious. Upon seeing Dugu Jalon\narrive, Jibron was visibly taken aback\nfor a moment, then bowed and said, \"Lord\nof the domain, Miss Dugu, Mr. Jabbron,\nyou seem very anxious,\" Duga Nonuang\nsaid in a cold voice. Lord of the\ndomain, I just saw a prophetic scene\nduring my meditation. Khalil Jabbrron\nsaid anxiously. I see that we are all\ngradually sinking deeper into the dark\nfog and many figures are searching for a\nway out on the edge of the darkness.\nAmong them are Lord Domain Lord Jin\nWuang, many virtuous people and Miss\nDugu, but a figure who looked a lot like\nLin Sha walked the fastest. He seemed to\nknow the way and had already stepped out\nwith one foot. But suddenly a\nchrysanthemum and a long knife stabbed\nat him from behind. I was startled awake\nfrom my meditation and came to seek the\ndomain lord's help in analyzing this.\nBut I feel this is a bad omen. Dugu\nnonwang s eyes gradually narrowed and\nher oppressive aura slowly and\ninvoluntarily emanated from her.\nChrysanthemum and sword the Japanese.\nAre the Japanese planning to ambush and\nkill Lynsha? Chapter 171. Yamamoto\nIsuroku searching for the missing lord.\nkill Lin Shiao? Upon hearing Dugu\nNanuang&lt;unk&gt;s words, he himself was\nstartled. Then she realized that she had\nforgotten Lin Xiao's situation. He led\nthe Lan region to victory over the Four\nKingdoms region in the resource\ncompetition, gaining massive resources.\nThrough a bet, he also won the Luck\nTalismen from the Four Kingdoms region,\nallowing hundreds of millions of lords\nin the Lnon region to enjoy the\nbenefits. It also exposed Kenzo Dohura's\ntrue colors, causing internal strife in\nthe Shikoku region. Hate Lynn shouted\nthe bone. If that happened, he is\ncurrently just a lord who has just\nentered the official district. If he is\nfound by the assassins sent by Japan,\nthe consequences will be unimaginable.\nShameless. Dugu Nanuang blurted out that\nif she could think of it, the Japanese\nmust have thought of it, too, and might\neven have already done it. Dugu Jalon\nglanced at her aunt with slight\nsurprise. In her memory, her aunt had\nalways been a composed person who would\nremain calm even if Mount Thai collapsed\nin front of her. She must have\nencountered situations more critical\nthan this before. And she had never seen\nher aunt so slightly out of control.\nShaolon, let's&lt;unk&gt; go right away and\nfind Lin Shia. Dugu Nanuang pulled Dugu\nJaon along, ready to depart when Jibron\nspoke up. Lord of the domain, please\ncalm down. In the prophetic scene,\nalthough Lin Sha was injured, he broke\nhis chrysanthemum and shattered his long\nsword. You should be fine for now. Lord\nDomain is extremely busy, there are even\nmore important matters awaiting your\nattention.\" Duga Nanchuang calmed down a\nbit and nodded, saying, \"Thank you for\nyour reminder, Mr. Jibron. All right,\nShaolan. Go and find out about Lyn\nXiao's current situation right away and\nsee if the prophetic scene has already\nappeared. I'll go make some preparations\nand arrange for a skilled person to\nsecretly protect Lin Sha. Upon hearing\nthis, a hint of pride flashed in\nJibron&lt;unk&gt;'s eyes, and he nodded\nslightly. What's wrong with Duga?\nJaalon. He hasn't answered my calls. If\nI can't latch onto the strongest thigh,\nthen I'll latch onto the second\nstrongest thigh, and I'll go find Chu\nYusi. Jang Dong Madman, the city lord of\nLan City in the Lan district, must have\nsome skills. Like a weary old mother\ndetermined to find a good school\ndistrict for her child, Lynsha\nimmediately thought of the second way to\ncurry favor with powerful figures. Let's\ndo it. Lyn Shao immediately gave\ninstructions, instructing Wong Ming to\ncoordinate all matters within his\nterritory except for Baoi. Whether it\nwas agricultural development, mining, or\ntraining various units, Wong Ming\ncoordinated everything. As the prime\nminister of the formerQin dynasty and a\nfigure in later historical records\ncompared to Guanghong and Jugal Leang,\nLin Shiao estimated that Wong Ming's\npolitical, intellectual, and command\nabilities were basically at their peak.\nIf judged by a game like Romance of the\nThree Kingdoms, these three attributes\nwould be at least 95 or above, if not\n99. It would definitely be better to\nentrust my territory to Wong Ming than\nto manage it myself. Moreover, Wong\nMing&lt;unk&gt;s performance in the previous\nbattle to intercept and kill Fuma Codoro\nearned him everyone's respect and\nrecognition. Although he was only Lin\nXiao's sixth hero, Wong Ming was the\noldest and naturally dignified. Coupled\nwith his outstanding abilities and Lyn\nXiao's obvious trust, it was only\nnatural that the soldiers obeyed his\ncommand. After arranging everything, Lyn\nShao tried to contact Chufinga, but no\none answered. Lyn Shao opened a portal\nand stepped directly into Lan City. Just\ngo directly to the city lord's mansion\nto find Chu Yusi. If he has any\nquestions, he will definitely ask Dugu\nNanuan. Here in the main hall of the\ncity lord's mansion, Chu Yusi still sat\nin the main seat with officials lined up\non his left and right, anxiously craning\ntheir necks in anticipation. The great\ngeneral of Japan has arrived. As the\nloud voice rang out, a group of Japanese\nenvoys stroed in arrogantly. The\nofficials remained silent, shrinking\nback as they watched the Japanese\nprocession approach. Upon seeing this,\nChu Yusi snorted coldly. The Japanese\nenvoy, still dressed in a kimono and\nwearing wooden clogs, walked straight\ntoward Chui. The leader was a man with a\nsalow complexion and a light beard. He\nwas quite handsome and imposing, much\nbetter than Kenzo Dohara. From afar, the\nman laughed heartily. Chui, it's been\nmany years. I've heard you're still as\neccentric as ever. I, Yamamoto Isuroku,\nhave come to visit you in person. What?\nAren't you welcome? When Yamamoto\nIsuroku arrived, Chu Yusi reluctantly\nrose to greet him and led him to a guest\nseat. Yamamoto Isuroku is the Grand\nGeneral of Japan, whose status far\nsurpasses that of Dohurkenzo. In Japan,\nhis position is only below that of Prime\nMinister Tojo Hideki and a few other\nhigh-ranking officials. Chu Yusi as the\nhead of Lan district is even slightly\ninferior in status. After Yamamoto\nIsuroku took his seat, the Japanese\npeople stood to his side looking down at\nthe dragon summer group opposite him\nwith their heads held high. I was\nunaware of General Yamamoto's presence.\nWhat brings you here? Chu Yusi too lazy\nto be polite? asked directly. Upon\nhearing this, Yamamoto Isuroku first\ngave a cold laugh, then said in a deep\nvoice, \"I am here today to lodge a\nstrong diplomatic protest with your\ncountry and your region.\" \"What? All the\nofficials of Langia were shocked upon\nhearing this. A diplomatic protest?\nThat's a big deal. Yesterday, a\nhigh-ranking lord of my eastern kingdom\nwent missing.\" Yamamoto Isuroku said his\nlast known location was in the official\ndistrict of your Lan region and he even\nsent a distress signal saying that he\nwas being ambushed by an organized and\nplanned conspiracy in the Lan district\nand that his life was hanging by a\nthread and he was in extreme danger.\nTherefore, on behalf of the Kingdom of\nJapan, I request that the Lan District\nof the Kingdom of Langia allow members\nof my special task force to enter the\nLan District to search for the missing\nlord. As soon as Yamamoto Isuroku\nfinished speaking, the hall erupted in\nnoise. Ridiculous. Absurd. Chu Yusi\nstood up abruptly. How could your lord\nfrom Japan have disappeared in my Lan\ndistrict? Yamamoto Iseroku said he was\ncarrying out a secret mission in\nconjunction with the western European\nregion and was just passing through the\nLN region. I cannot disclose the\ndetails. However, this lord is of great\nsignificance to my eastern kingdom.\nTherefore, I, Yamamoto Iseroku, as the\ngrand general of the Eastern Kingdom,\nhave personally come to your Lnon city\nto lodge a diplomatic protest and demand\nthat if you were indeed involved in the\nplot to attack my Eastern Kingdom, Lord,\nplease stop immediately and return the\nLord. We will discuss the losses and\ncompensation later. Impossible. Utterly\nabsurd. Shu Yusi shouted. Your donging\nlord has absolutely nothing to do with\nmy Lnon district. All right, if you did\nnot attack my lord, please allow our\ntask force to enter the Lonan region to\nsearch for him. Yamamoto Isuroku\nsneered. That's a reasonable request,\nisn't it? Nonsense. You think I'm being\nreasonable? Chu Yusi cursed angrily, but\nwas pulled back by an official beside\nhim. Lord Chu, mind your image. The\nofficials of Lshia Kingdom also began to\nwhisper among themselves. They're only\nasking to search for their high-ranking\nlord. They have no other demands. That's\nnot unreasonable, is it? Yes. Since it's\na joint mission with Western Europe, it\nmust be very important. And our Lnon\nregion should help. We have nothing to\nfear if we are upright. Since we have\nnot taken any action against the\nJapanese lord, we are not afraid of\ntheir search. Yes, Lord Shu. What's\nwrong with letting them search? Chapter\n172. You want to reignite the war? We\ncan't agree. The fact that the Japanese\ngeneral has personally come speaks\nvolumes about the importance of the\nsituation. We should prioritize the\ngreater good and help Japan this time.\nIt would be a friendly gesture of mutual\nassistance with our neighbor. The\nofficials from Liao were still\nchattering on when Chu Yusi finally\ncouldn't take it anymore. He shoved\naside the official beside him who was\nadvising him to mind his image and\nshouted, \"Shut up all of you. What kind\nof behavior is this? Do you want to\nbecome a laughingstock?\" Yamamoto\nIseroku, I absolutely cannot agree to\nyour request. Chu Yusi said, \"I haven't\neven investigated why your lord is in my\nLan region, yet you dare to use that as\nan excuse to try and enter my Lnon\nregion? How laughable.\" Yamamoto Isuroku\nsneered. I have already stated that this\nhigh-ranking lord is passing through\nLiao on a secret mission. I don't seem\nto have any obligation to explain what\nkind of mission it is to you, do I? With\nthat, he narrowed his eyes, raised his\naura, and shouted, \"My Eastern Kingdom\nhas fought the Dragon Sea Kingdom 37\ntimes in the past 100 years, winning 36\nand drawing one. Western Europe is home\nto many powerful nations. Is it any of\nyour business, Longa, to question our\njoint mission with Japan and Western\nEurope? I, Yamamoto Ioku, have already\nshown you great respect by coming here\nin person. You dare to stop me from\nentering the Lan district to search? Are\nyou really besieging my lord? Aren't you\nafraid that war will break out again\nbetween Japan and Lia? The last sentence\nwas uttered by Yamamoto Isuroku with an\nair of profound authority. All the\nofficials present except for Chu Yusi\ntook several steps back, cold sweat\npouring down their backs. Chu Yusi's\ntrain of thought was also interrupted by\nYamamoto Isuroka's shout, but he still\nstiffened his neck and shouted to\nhimself, \"No means no. Oh, Lord City\nLord, the greater good must be\nconsidered. Lord of the city, General\nYamamoto has only requested to search\nfor the missing Lord. He has no\nmalicious intent. Why can't we allow\nit?\" \"Yes! Yes, Lord.\" City Lord, don't\nact rashly. Our Lung Sha cannot afford\nanother battle. filled with indignation\nwhen he saw that Chu Yusi had to resist\nthe Japanese envoy while also being wary\nof his own bureaucratic team betraying\nhim. The young official knew that he was\nof low status and his words carried\nlittle weight. So seeing this situation,\nhe suddenly came up with a plan. He\nquietly started a live stream and the\ncamera was pointed at the people who\nwere fighting. He wanted to expose the\ncurrent dispute to the public so that\neveryone in Lia would know the\nshamelessness of Japan and the\nincompetence of Liao officials. Even if\nit means being punished and losing the\nright to be an official again, I am\nwilling to do it. The live stream\nstarted and people started coming in.\nBut the argument in the main hall\ncontinued. The Japanese team was\naggressive while the Lia officials were\nyielding at every turn, clearly showing\nthe difference in their power dynamics.\nChu Yusi&lt;unk&gt;s eyes grew colder and\ncolder. No matter who tried to persuade\nhim, he remained unmoved, gritting his\nteeth and refusing to let the Japanese\nenter Longan district to search for the\nmissing lord. Seeing that the atmosphere\nwas almost right, Yamamoto Isuroku\ncasually stood up. Chu Yusi just\nadmitted. Today, our special task force\nis entering Lan District. Do you see any\nofficials on your side? You'd better\nagree, but you have no choice but to\nagree. That's right, Lord City Lord.\nThis doesn't cause us any loss. Isn't it\na loss to let others enter our territory\nunder false pretenses, to lose face,\nintegrity, and national dignity? Chu\nYusi said through gritted teeth. Then\nlet's compromise your lordship. How\nabout we ask the various powerful\nnations of Western Europe to arbitrate\nand mediate? Yes, the western European\ncountries are all representatives of\ndemocracy and freedom and they are also\nstrong in the spirit of contracts. They\nalso have the advantage of strong\nnational power. Let them take the lead\nin arbitration. I think this matter can\nbe resolved in this way. It's excellent.\nIf we win, Japan won't make any more\ndemands. If we lose, the whole world\nwill think that the Japanese should be\nallowed in and we'll just do as they\nsay. Shu Yusi's words sparked a flurry\nof comments from the officials who kept\ninsisting that he agree to the Japanese\nrequest, much to his dismay. At this\ntime, the officials are incompetent and\nutterly incompetent. Shameless Japan,\nbarking and howling. Lord Shu, this\ndemand must not be agreed to. If we\nagree to the Japanese today, our\ndescendants will curse all the officials\npresent. As the loud voice rang out, the\npeople arguing in the hall stopped and\nturned to look. It turned out to be Lynn\nShiao and a group of young lords who\npushed past the gatekeepers and stroed\nin. Lyn Sha said all those words loudly.\nSeeing Lyn Sha leading the lord straight\ntowards Chu Yusi, everyone finally\nrealized what was happening. How dare\nyou cause such a disturbance at the city\nlord's mansion? How dare you? Who gave\nyou the audacity to trespass into the\ncity lord's mansion? I am the last\ndisciple of Lord Dugu. Of course, I have\nthe courage given by the Lord himself.\nLyn Sha was not afraid at all. He\ncasually made up a story and directly\ninvoked the great reputation of Aunt\nDugu, which shocked the many officials\nin the hall who wanted to make trouble.\nTheir questions were stuck in their\nthroats. This kid doesn't play by the\nrules. Lyn Shao, tell me why you can't\nagree. When Shu Yusi saw Lin Shiao and\nhis group approaching, he felt a sense\nof relief for no apparent reason. Taking\nadvantage of the officials hesitation,\nhe asked them a question, \"Lord Shu,\nthis is clearly in humiliation of Lia, a\ntest of his abilities.\" Lyn Sha walked\nto the center of the hall, looked\naround, and said loudly, \"To demand\nentry into the territory of a sovereign\nstate without any reasonable\njustification is an insult. insulting\nLshia's sovereignty and being trampled\nunderfoot by the Japanese. If we agree\nto the Japanese's request to enter Lon\nterritory to search for someone today,\nthey'll dare to come to your house to\nsearch for someone tomorrow. Today they\nsay a highranking lord has gone missing.\nTomorrow they ll blame Lshia for even a\ndog going missing. This is a test.\nMaking unreasonable demands. Observing\nLang Sha&lt;unk&gt;s reaction. Assessing\nLshia&lt;unk&gt;s capabilities and risks is\nalso a test. Preparing for future war.\nMy little ones, am I right? In the hall,\nLyn Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s words were firm and\nresolute. Faced with the sudden\nquestion, everyone from Japan fell into\nan eerie silence. Gentlemen, you can\nunderstand, can't you? Lyn Sha turned\naround and looked at the official. And\nthere are some self-righteous little\ncuties who place their hopes on Western\nEuropean countries. Don't you know that\nWestern Europe and Japan are in cahoots?\nThose who keep advocating for agreeing\nto this unreasonable demand are either\nstupid or malicious. Lord Shu, such\nofficials are no longer fit to hold\ntheir positions without doing any work.\nI suggest they be replaced. Lyn Shao\nsaid, \"We absolutely cannot agree to the\nJapanese demands. If we do, the backbone\nof Liao will be completely broken.\nThat's right. Behind Lin Shiao, Ding\nLelay, Shufinga, Julie, Wong Bo, Panch\nShan Yu, Lu Jaoing, Guang Jun,\nChinuandu, and all those who had\nparticipated in the resource competition\nwere present, and they all applauded and\ncheered. Let the Japanese give up on\nthat idea. Get back to Japan right now.\nThe sovereignty of Lia is inviable. Chu\nYusi nodded in approval. Finally, a\nsensible lord had emerged, whose words\nhit the nail on the head, exposing the\nJapanese conspiracy and giving them a\ngood slap in the face. The officials of\nLiao were also shocked by Lin Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s\nwords and murmured, unable to speak. If\nI agree, will my spine be completely\nbroken? So, what seemed like no loss was\nactually just the Japanese testing us.\nDespicable, cunning. Just as\nLinhao&lt;unk&gt;s words had slightly brought\nthe situation under control, Yamamoto\nIsuroku suddenly stood up. Huh? How\nlaughable that you, a mere commoner\nlord, have no right to speak to me.\nChapter 173. Dugu Nanuang appears and\nissues a challenge. Yamamoto Isuroku\nsuddenly stood up and let out a loud\nshout once again changing the balance of\npower between the two sides. Lynn Shiao,\nthis is none of your business. The\nhighle diplomatic meeting between the\ntwo countries is none of the business of\nunqualified people to point fingers.\nLord Shu, get rid of all these uninvited\nnewbies. Otherwise, I will refuse to\ncontinue negotiating with you. Strange,\nyou keep saying you won't talk to me.\nBut how do you know my name? A mere\ncommoner lord? Lyn Sha tilted his head\nand asked, \"Who are you?\" I am Yamamoto\nIsuroku, the great shogun of the Eastern\nKingdom. Yamamoto Isuroku. Lyn Sha\nlooked surprised and even picked at his\near with his finger. Did I hear that\nright? I am Yamamoto Isuroku and I will\nnever change my name or surname.\nYamamoto Isuroku said arrogantly. First\nit was Kinszo Dohurra, then Isuroku\nYamamoto. And is there anyone else among\nyou named Hideki Tojo? How dare you\naddress my Japanese prime minister by\nhis given name? My Japanese prime\nminister is Tojo Haidakuni, not Tojo\nHideki. The key is Kuwin, and Kuwin is\nthe key, so there's no difference. Lyn\nSha laughed and said, \"It seems we're\nall old acquaintances. There's no need\nfor you to beat around the bush. Tell\nme, how far along is your plan to invade\nLia?\" Insolence. Yamamoto. Isoku roared.\nWho gave you the right to question this\ngeneral? Lord Shu, why haven't you\ndriven this brat away yet? Yamamoto\nIsuroku gritted his teeth. His fierce\ngaze revealing his true colors and said,\n\"If you don't ask him to leave,\nwe&lt;unk&gt;ll have no choice but to take our\nleave and abandon diplomacy in favor of\nother means to handle this matter. Don't\nblame us for not informing you\nbeforehand.\" \"Just as Chu Yusi was about\nto speak,\" Yamamoto\nroared again. \"Does Liao really want to\nstart a war with my Japan? Why are you\nshouting so loudly? Are you feeling\nguilty?\" Lynn Shiao remained calm and\ncomposed. A stark contrast to Yamamoto\nIsuroku, who was shouting and yelling\nbeside him. Lord Shu, the so-called\ndisappearance of the Lord is just an\nexcuse for these petty people. Whether\nthey agree or not, they will find an\nexcuse to invade Lia. Lin Shia sneered.\nThe wolfish ambitions of the Japanese\nare obvious to all. You have no right to\nspeak here. Yamamoto roared. Chi, do you\nreally want war? The atmosphere became\nextremely tense. On one side, there was\nthe aggressive Japanese general and his\narrogant team. On one side, there was\nthe stubborn lord of Lan city and the\ncowardly officials of Lan district who\nwere adept at backstabbing. Many young\nlords were also watching from the hall.\nIt seems that the fates of Lia and\nDonging converge at this very moment.\nLet's start the war. A voice came from\nbehind. Neither Chu Yusi nor Linsha. The\nofficials, realizing what was happening,\nbowed in unison, lord of the domain. Lyn\nSha also turned his head and saw Duga\nNonwang, dressed in gorgeous clothes and\nwith a cold and noble temperament,\nwalking with a murderous aura. She was\ntall and slender, with a cold and aloof\nface, looking only in her 30s. Her\nfox-like eyes were bright and slightly\nupturned at the corners with clear and\nbright pupils. Her skin was as white as\nporcelain. Her features were striking\nand her demeanor was composed. She was\ntruly a stunning beauty, a strikingly\nbeautiful woman with an appearance that\ncould topple kingdoms and cities. She\nwore an elaborate headdress and a long\ndress with intricate patterns. The\nextravagant jewelry and dress did not\ndetract from her charm at all, but\nrather made her appear even more elegant\nand noble. When she appeared, she shone\nlike a bright pearl, attracting\neveryone's attention while making people\nafraid to look directly at her. Beside\nher was a tall old man with a high nose\nand blue eyes. When Yamamoto Isuroku saw\nDuga Nonwang, he could only bow and\ngreet her. Lord of Dragon domain,\ngreetings, General Yamamoto, you've been\npressuring me about whether Lord Lia\nCity wants to start a war. Duga Nanuang\nsaid coldly. The answer from my dragon\nSia kingdom is let's go to war. Did you\nhear me clearly? This Yamamoto Isuroku\nwas stunned and Shu Yusi who was\nstanding next to him also looked at Dugu\nNanuang with surprise and uncertainty.\nSo it turns out that Lord Dugu is the\nmadman of Jangdong. A thought floated\nthrough Chu Yusi's mind. I Chu Yusi know\nthat I cannot act rashly in this\nsituation. Yet the domain lord directly\ndemands a head-on confrontation with\nJapan. This is a major diplomatic matter\nbetween our two countries. Lord lonely\ndomain. It cannot be decided in a single\nsentence. Further consultation and\ndiscussion are necessary. I am the\ndomain lord and I make the decisions.\nDug nonwang said coldly. General\nYamamoto wants a war. So I will give you\none. In addition, Dugu Nanuang turned\nher head and looked at Lin Sha, who\nstood calmly in the center of the hall\nand said, \"Lin Shiao is my last\ndisciple, essentially a reserve officer.\nI hereby declare that every word he says\nis valid. From this moment forward, Lin\nShiao is promoted to deputy city lord of\nLnon City. His duties include assisting\nthe city lord in contacting the Japanese\nenvoy and formulating plans.\" Well, now\nLynn Shiao is qualified to speak with\nyou, General Yamamoto. Thunder rumbles,\nthunder roars. Lyn Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s expression\nalso began to falter. Aunt Dugu, what\nare you doing? A mere squabble of pride\nhas pushed me to become the deputy city\nlord. You stormed over here as if you\nknew everything that had happened.\nAren't you afraid of entrusting this to\nthe wrong person? At that moment, out of\nthe corner of Lyn Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s eye, he saw\na figure in purple slowly walk into the\nhall and stand behind the crowd. The\nstunningly beautiful woman nodded to Lin\nSha from afar when she saw him looking\nat her. Lyn Sha nodded slightly in\nresponse. It's the old squad leader\nagain. Has the old squad leader made his\nmove once more? On the other side, under\nthe supreme pressure of Dugu Nanuang,\nYamamoto Isuroku was sweating profusely.\nHe had only intended to use the aura and\npower of the Japanese nation to force\nChu Yusi. But he did not expect that\nDugan Nanuang would suddenly arrive with\nan even stronger aura and greater\ncourage than him. Knowing that\npreparations in Japan were not yet fully\ncomplete, Yamamoto Isuroku under\npressure gritted his teeth and said, \"It\nseems that Lord Dugu has no intention of\nresolving this matter peacefully.\nPeaceful resolution. What a joke. When\ndid General Yamamoto ever consider\nresolving this matter peacefully? Dugu\nNanuang coldly flung out a small,\nbroken, bloodstained iron plate, which\ncrashed to the feet of the Japanese\npeople with a loud bang. Your scheme\nbegan the moment your country's ninja\nlord entered my Lan region to\nassassinate Lin Sha. What? Everyone\npresent was greatly surprised. Yamamoto\nIsuroka was takenback. He bent down and\npicked up the iron plaque on which the\nwords wind demon were faintly engraved.\nFor a moment, his eyes darted around,\nfilled with surprise and uncertainty.\nDugu Nanuang said, \"Your missing lord\nwas merely sent to assassinate my closed\ndoor disciple. Your so-called search is\nnothing more than a further search for\nLin Xiao's location to assassinate him\nand also serves to humiliate Lia and\nundermine Lia's sovereignty. From the\nvery beginning, this was a conspiracy by\nyour Japanese nation. You've wanted to\nstart a war with Lia for a long time.\nDugu Nanuang's words were clear and\ncalm, devoid of any emotion, but the\ntruth she revealed chilled everyone to\nthe bone. Japan has long harbored ill\nintentions and planned to continue its\ninvasion of China. So it was indeed your\ncountry that killed Kodoruma. Yamamoto\nIsuroku had regained his senses. His\nvoice was low and cold as he sneered.\nYour country killed my highranking lord.\nThis grudge cannot go unavvenged. After\nsaying that, Yamamoto Isuroku raised his\nhead, his cold eyes fixed on Dugun\nNanuang in front of him. Japan is\nissuing a declaration of war against\nDragon Sea. Chapter 174 Dual Arena\nBattle 230 million tales. Japan is\nDragon Sea. Yamamoto Isuroku looked at\nDugan Nanuang and said, \"Word by word,\nI, Yamamoto Isuroku, as the shogun of\nthe Kingdom of Japan, hereby issue a\ndeclaration of war to the Kingdom of Lia\non behalf of the Kingdom of Japan. The\nKingdom of Japan is about to engage in a\nbattle of national destiny with the\nKingdom of Langia.\" A battle for\nnational destiny. The crowd in the hall\nerupted in uproar. The National Fate\nArena Battle is the highest level of\ncombat conflict in the battlefield of\nall races apart from formal battles\nbetween two countries. In fact, the\nNational Fortune Arena is often viewed\nas a battle only. It is more structured,\nhas rules and conditions, and is a\nbattle witnessed by the main god system.\nUnexpectedly, the Japanese team, which\noriginally came only to make diplomatic\nproposals, actually agreed to go to war\nand directly named the National Fortune\nArena. Good. Seeing the tall, elderly\nman beside her nod slightly, Duga\nNanuang immediately agreed without\nhesitation. So be it, a national destiny\ncontest. I'm going to stake the next 10\nyears of your Japanese nation's destiny\non it. He Lord Dugu has quite the\nambition. The national fortune arena\nfollows the principle of equality. So\nyour dragon kingdom will also bet 10\nyears of its national fortune. No\nproblem. Dugan nonwang said calmly.\nGood. Lord Dugu is a straightforward\nperson. But I have one more condition\nbefore the national fortune arena. First\nopen the heroic martial arts arena.\nYamamoto Isuroku abruptly changed the\nsubject pointing at Lin Shiao. And he\nmust participate. What? Everyone present\nwas taken aback. The heroic arena is a\nbattle arena specifically for young\nlords and participants cannot be above\nlevel 50. Participating in the martial\narts arena is generally aimed at the\nopponent's young prodigy with the goal\nof stifling the opponent's future\nmasters in their growth process and\neliminating the opponent's fighting\nforce. Therefore, the casualty rate in\nthe heroic martial arts arena is\nextremely high. Both sides fight with\nall their might. The heroic arena itself\ndoesn't offer any major rewards. Its\nmain purpose is to kill. Yamamoto\nIsuroku has opened the heroic martial\narts arena for Lin Shiao. The Japanese\ngeneral specifically named Lin Shiao as\nthe target. Amidst the discussions, Lin\nSha stood proudly showing no sign of\nbacking down. Dugu Nanuang slowly said,\n\"What if I don't agree?\" Heih he if\nlonga doesn't agree I naturally can't\nforce him to start a duel in the arena\nYamamoto Iuroku said leisurely we have\nno choice but to return to Japan and\ndiscuss the matter with our allies to\nplan for the future the national fortune\narena is witnessed by the supreme god so\nit can be considered fair this time I\nthe general want to have a duel with you\nin the national fortune arena after we\ngo back and discuss it perhaps we will\nhave a better way to maintain the\ndignity of my Eastern Kingdom. At that\npoint, it won't be something that can be\nsolved by simply opening the National\nFortune Arena. You shameless. In the\nhall, Chufinga stepped forward and\nshouted angrily. Lyn Shia only has\nF-level talent. You specifically asked\nLynn Shia to participate just to kill\nhim. You want revenge now that Lyn Sha\nhas exposed your plot. That's right.\nThat token just now belonged to the\nmissing lord from Japan, didn't it? Our\ndomain lord already said that it was you\nwho sent your lord to assassinate\nLynsha. Now they're using the national\ndestiny arena as leverage. It's utterly\nshameless. Dugu Nanuang also turned\naround. Her stunningly beautiful eyes\nlooking at Lin Shiao. You know this is\naimed at you. If you don't agree, I'll\nrefuse. Dugu Nanuang swords echoed\ndirectly in Lin Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s mind. Lyn Sha\nwas immediately amused. Aunt Dugu could\neven transmit voices. She really had\nsome tricks up her sleeve. Master. Lyn\nSha bowed and greeted him with master,\nthus confirming their relationship. Then\nhe said frankly, the national destiny\narena is about to begin, and we need 3\nmonths to prepare. Victory in the heroic\nmartial arts arena can greatly influence\nthe national fortune arena and boost\nmorale. As the deputy city lord of Lnon\nCity and the official in charge of this\nnegotiation and diplomatic event, I\nnaturally have an inescapable\nresponsibility to meet the demands of\nthe Eastern Kingdom for participation in\nthe war. Of course, I'm willing to\nparticipate,\" Lyn Shao said loudly. \"To\nlive, be a hero. To die, be a ghost\namong heroes. I, Lyn Sha, am willing to\nparticipate in the heroic martial arts\narena for Lia. If I win, I will serve my\ncountry and people. If I lose, it will\nbe a glorious victory, and my life will\nnot have been in vain. Good. In the\nhall, the young lords who had come with\nLynn, Shiao cheered loudly, extremely\nexcited. I, Ding Lay, also want to\narena. Count me in, Wong Bo. I,\nChufinga, will definitely go. The crowd\nwas outraged. Seeing this, Yamamoto\nIsuroku sneered. Lord Dugu, the National\nFortune Arena will open in three months\nand the Heroic Martial Arts Arena will\nopen in one week. Do you agree or not?\nDugu Nanuang turned around with a cold\nface, looking down at Yamamoto Isuroku\nlike a queen and said, \"The National\nDestiny Contest is a gamble on the\nnation's fate over the next 10 years.\"\nYamamoto Isuroku. All right, Lynn Sha\nmust participate in the heroic martial\narts arena. Lynn Shiao said coldly. I\ncan participate in the heroic martial\narts arena, but if my Lia Kingdom wins\nthe heroic martial arts arena, you will\nhave to pay 230 million tales of silver.\n230 million tales. Yamamoto was taken\naback and sneered. Why 230 million? I\nlike this number. You're worth that much\nmoney. Lyn Xiao, I'm covered in\ndiamonds. Yamamoto Isuroku was\nhumiliated. Lyn Xiao's shamelessness was\ninfuriating. You set conditions and we\ncan set conditions, too. Lyn Shao said,\n\"You only need to pay these 23,000 tales\nof silver if you lose. But if you win,\nyou can get rid of me once and for all\nand no longer need to send ninjas to\nassassinate me. I imagine the reward you\nreceived from the heavens was quite\nsubstantial, wasn't it, Yamamoto?\"\nIsuroku narrowed his eyes, his killing\nintent radiating. Lyn Sha, however,\nremained unfazed and continued. What\nscared? Don't dare to come. Thinking of\nthe several powerful geniuses on his\nside, Yamamoto Isuroku felt he would\nnever lose and said, \"Orogant brat. What\ngood would it do to agree?\" Okay, let's\nsign the contract. Dugu Nanuang\nimmediately signed a contract with\nYamamoto Iseroku under the witness of\nthe main god system. The countdown to\nthe National Fortune Arena and the\nheroic martial arts arena has officially\nbegun. He you'll all realize sooner or\nlater that there's no good outcome to\ngoing against my great Eastern Empire.\nYour Lang Shia is about to suffer\nanother defeat. The great empire of\nthousands of years ago will eventually\nbe crushed and forever trampled\nunderfoot by my eastern Japan. And all\nof this stems from this unremarkable\nyoung man. Is it worth it? Yamamoto\nIsuroku made a harsh statement, gave Lin\nShia a cold look, and then turned and\nled the others away through the side\ndoor. At this moment, there was a\ncommotion outside and a security guard\ncame to report. Lord, City Lord. A large\nnumber of lords have arrived outside the\ncity lord's mansion, shouting that they\ncannot compromise with the Japanese and\nthat war is the only option. Many more\nlords are trying to break into the city\nlord's mansion hall and we can't stop\nthem. Chu Yusi frowned. What's going on?\nHow did they know what happened here?\nDugu Nanuang walked gracefully to the\nmain seat of the city lord's mansion and\nsat down directly. I think we should let\nhim explain it himself. Her gaze fell\nupon a young official at the back of the\ncrowd. Lynn douching, \"Step forward.\"\nThe young official walked out with a\ncalm expression. With all the officials\neyes fixed on him, Dugu Jaolon spoke\nagain. \"Lynn Shiao, take the rest of you\nand leave. Make sure to reassure the\nlords outside and explain the situation\ninside to them. The heroic arena is now\nentirely in your hands. Do not let down\nthe expectations of everyone in the\nDragon Sa Kingdom.\" Dugu Nanuang said,\ninunciating each word clearly. Don't\nlose your life and disgrace me. Chapter\n175. Shock. Gene Wuang. Selection.\nExtra. Extra. General Yamamoto Isuroku\nof Japan has suddenly arrived in the Lan\ndistrict, making unreasonable demands\nand humiliating the Lia Kingdom. The\nofficials of Lan fell silent. The young\nlord Lynn Shao rushed to the city lord's\nmansion and angrily berated the\nofficials and the Japanese envoy\ndelegation. Duga domains main force\nsupports Lin Shiao and publicly appoints\nhim as the deputy city lord. Lia and\nDonging immediately signed a contract\nfor a battle on two arenas, the national\nfortune arena and the heroic martial\narts arena. The 38th major war between\nthe dragon Sia Kingdom and the Eastern\nIning Kingdom in nearly a century is\nabout to begin. Extra extra. Inside Lan\nCity, a newspaper vendor named Zilangen\nloudly hawkked his wares. The breaking\nnews was broadcast repeatedly in the Lan\nDistrict chat channel and even\nthroughout the entire Lang Shia domain\nchat channel. An unprecedented uproar\nswept through every corner of the Dragon\nSea Kingdom with discussions rising and\nfalling like waves. From officials at\nall levels to novice lords, as well as\nteachers, students, and ordinary people\nin the real world of the Dragon Sa\nKingdom, everyone quickly learned about\nthe matter. Japan is about to go to war\nwith Dragon Sia again. Well done,\nLongia. Well done, your majesty. We\nabsolutely cannot let the Japanese take\nadvantage of us. and Lyn Sha. Lyn Sha is\nalso great. He just led us to victory in\nthe resource competition and then\nuncovered the Japanese conspiracy. Lia\nwill win. Go Lia, I want to sign up. I\nwant to sign up for the heroic martial\narts arena. In no time, countless people\nwere discussing this matter on the\nstreets and in chat channels. She's gone\nmad. That woman, Dugan Schwang, is so\nimpulsive, so easily starting another\nwar with the powerful Eastern Kingdom.\nSome veteran lords couldn't help but\njoin the discussion in the chat channel.\nThey were senior, older, and had seen a\nlot of the world. Most of them held\nimportant positions in Lia and had\nlittle faith in Duga Nonwang, an\nimpulsive young person. The moment they\nspoke, the previously heated chat\nchannel fell silent. She shouldn't have\nbeen made the domain lord in the first\nplace. When she first took office, she\nfought to a draw with Japan and then\nimmediately lost a match. She hasn't\nlearned her lesson yet and wants to\nfight Japan again. Do you think the\nkingdom of Japan is so easy to deal\nwith? We are all seasoned warriors and\nnone of us have ever defeated the Lord\nof Japan. The Japanese warriors bushidto\nspirit which is characterized by their\nwillingness to die for their cause far\nsurpasses that of my dragon Sia. We're\ndoomed to lose to Japan. In the past\ncentury, we have fought Japan 37 times,\nlosing 36 and drawing one. Can we win?\nThe vast majority of veteran lords were\nnot optimistic about the dragon kingdom.\nThat's right. If we start a war lightly\nand lose again, I think Dugu Nanuang\nshould resign as the lord of the dragon\nsia domain. It's all because of that\nyoung lord Lyn Shiao. He's just a brat.\nAll he knows is how to show off. All the\ncivil and military officials knew they\nshould be prudent, but he insisted on\nmaking the Japanese lose face and became\nfurious. This unpleasant incident with\nJapan was all his fault. That bastard is\nutterly despicable. The Dugu family is\nno longer what it once was. Each\ngeneration is worse than the last. I\nthink we should let someone else take\nthe position of the next Dragon summer\ndomain lord. Our Lia truly cannot afford\nanother defeat. Whether it's a battle on\nthe front lines or the somewhat fair\nnational destiny arena witnessed by the\nmain god system. I've heard that Dugun\nVois has staked another 10 years of the\nnation's destiny on this one. It's truly\nthat Lynn Shiao actually dares to dream\nof winning the 230 million tales of\nsilver in the heroic martial arts arena.\nHow laughable. What a terrible thing.\nAlas, Longa is no longer the Longa of\nthousands of years ago. He is merely an\naging giant. How can he fight against\nthe rising Japanese nation which is like\na new son? In my opinion, it would be\nbetter to merge into the Japanese sphere\nas soon as possible and become a member\nof the greater East Asia co-rossperity\nsphere. The chat channel fell silent.\nEveryone was angry but dared not speak\nout. Just as pessimistic and negative\nemotions were reaching their peak. A\njarring voice rang out. You bunch of old\nfogies, you'd be fine if you didn't go\nto the battlefield, but instead you're\nhere spouting sarcastic remarks who just\nsaid they wanted to join the greater\nEast Asia co-rossperity sphere. Come out\nhere. I, Gene Wuang, will beat you to\ndeath. It turns out it was Gene Wuang,\nthe patriarch of the Gene family, one of\nthe 10 chief lords of the dragon summer\ndomain, a powerful lord who has been\nfighting in the ninth heaven for many\nyears. Gene Wuang kept talking. Are you\nall just showing off your seniority\nhere? Who's more senior than me? They\nhold high positions and enjoy wealth and\nluxury, yet they don't think about\nmaking any contributions to Lia. Lord\nLia is charging into battle, and you're\nall making sarcastic remarks from\nbehind. Lyn Shia was right. What a bunch\nof incompetent and utterly worthless\npeople. What's that saying again?\nHolding a position without doing any\nwork. An elderly lord retorted. Gin\nWuang, when did you start speaking up\nfor Lyn Sha? Why can't I speak up for\nLyn Sha? He's the one who killed your\ndescendants. Which descendant? Oh, damn\nit. It's because I gave too many of my\nlucky charms. Whatever. Gene Wuang said,\n\"It's none of your business what my Gene\nfamily does.\" Lyn Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s outburst\nyesterday against the Japanese and\nofficials of Lan District is enough for\nme to say a few words of justice for\nhim. Also, you should show some respect\nto Lyn Shao. He is now the deputy city\nlord of Lon City, and his rank may even\nbe higher than some of you old fogies.\nJin Wuang spoke at lightning speed,\nseemingly without needing to catch his\nbreath, and coupled with his incessant\nchatter, he unleashed a torrent of abuse\nthat left the older lords utterly\nexasperated. They didn't dare continue\nchatting in the public channel and\nsheepishly logged off or went to chat\nprivately. The chat channel was finally\nfree and a lord jumped out. Gene Wooang,\nyou old devil. I knew you were a good\ndevil. From today onwards, you and Lyn\nShia are my favorite people. Gene Wuang,\nI'm sorry. I made a terrible joke about\nyour descendant Gene Dang before. I\nwon't do it again. Gene Wuang, don't\nbring up the sore spot. Meanwhile, in\nthe chat channel, Gene Wuang angrily\nberates the pessimistic old lord, and\nthe clash between the two forces is\ndifferent. In front of the city, Lord's\nmansion was packed with people three\nlayers deep. Brothers and sisters who\nwant to participate in the heroic\nmartial arts arena. On behalf of brother\nLynsha, I would like to thank you all.\nIt is you who have shown the entire Lung\nSha the spirit of youth. A figure stood\non a high platform shouting loudly. It\nwas Dinglay. But this martial arts arena\nis an extremely brutal arena where both\nsides must fight to the death and the\ncasualty rate is extremely high. I know\nyour sincere patriotism, but those who\nare not strong enough will only be\nsending themselves to their deaths. So,\nBrother Lynn Sha set the rules. Dinglay\nshouted. First, you must defeat any one\nof brother Lin Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s three vassel\nlords. Ding Lay pointed to Tu Shan by\nChian, Heay and Chuning Ming on the\nstage, and Tu Shan by Chian proudly\npuffed out her chest. After defeating\nthem, you can then challenge me to a\nduel. Only if you can defeat me or gain\nmy approval can you participate in the\nheroic martial arts arena. Chapter 176.\nThe past of Dugu. Battles between\nsoldiers and generals. Mr. Khalil\nJibron, do you also think I was too\nimpulsive? In the unassuming ancient\npalace, Dugu Nanuang asked in a low-key\nmanner, \"Lord of the domain, neither\ncountry can afford to lose face. If we\nare hesitant and cautious in everything\nwe do, the Dragon Sa Kingdom will only\nsink deeper and deeper into the quagmire\nof decline.\" Did Mr. Jibron not predict\nthis battle? Khalil Jabbrron said, \"The\nfate of nations is in constant flux.\nEven a small change can alter the entire\nsituation. Such a big matter. I can't\nsee through it. Finally, Jabbron slowly\nsaid, \"Lord Dugu, you should listen to\nyour heart. Once you've chosen\nsomething, you should do it firmly.\nSeeking divine intervention or\ndivination for everything is not the\nbehavior of a wise ruler. Thank you for\nthe reminder, Prophet.\" Khalil Jibron\nrose to take his leave. After a long\nwhile, Dugen Nonwang sighed softly.\nShaolon, do you also think I'm too\nimpulsive? and he must have her reasons\nfor doing this and Gallon will only\nsupport her. Dugu Jaalon slowly walked\nout from a corner of the room and said\nsoftly, \"Dugu Nanuang was present the\nentire time while she was talking to\nKhalil Jibron. The Japanese\nassassination attempt on Lin Shiao\nbrought back some bad memories for me.\"\nDugu Nanuang gestured for Jaon to sit\ndown facing her. I've never told you how\nyour parents died. Dugu Jaolan\nimmediately understood and his voice\nbecame slightly serious. Is it also\nrelated to the Japanese? That's right.\nBack then, I was just a chief lord\nfollowing in the footsteps of my sister\nand brother-in-law fighting together for\nMy brother-in-law is the lord of Lshia.\nBack then, he led Lia in the 36th war\nagainst Japan. In the early stages of\nthe war, after years of forbearance and\nbiting his time, Lang Shia had recovered\na great deal of strength. We launched a\nsurprise attack and forced the Japanese\nto retreat in defeat. Dugu Nanuang sis,\nbut it was quickly replaced by her usual\ncoldness. But who knew that just as the\nwar between the two countries was\nraging, my sister and brother-in-law\nwere assassinated in Lsha Kingdom and\nboth died. Dugu Jaolon&lt;unk&gt;s eyes\ndarkened. Although there is no\nconclusive evidence. Afterwards, I found\ntraces of chakra energy unique to Japan.\nA small amount of holy aura and my\nsister and brother-in-laws wounds match\nthe wounds on the Japanese sword.\nTherefore, Dugan Nanuang said coldly,\n\"This matter is inextricably linked to\nthe Japanese. The other chief lords and\nI all believe that the assassination was\ncarried out by the Japanese. But even if\nwe knew, what could we do? When two\ncountries are at war, they will stop at\nnothing. Can we go to another country to\ncomplain about the death of our leader?\nI was appointed to succeed as the lord\nof the dragon summer domain in a time of\ncrisis. But in the end, I was still\nunable to maintain the advantage that my\nsister had built up. That battle ended\nin a draw. This is also the only battle\nin nearly a hundred years that my long\nsha has not lost. Dugan Nanuang gave a\nself-deprecating laugh. Then I fought\nanother battle and you know the result.\nIn return I have 10 years of peace and\n10 years of being subservient. So today\nwhen I learned that Lin Sha had been\nassassinated, memories flashed through\nmy mind and the forbearance of the past\n10 years exploded overnight. There was\nboth impulse and premeditation involved.\nGudunang regained her aloof demeanor and\nsmiled slightly at Gudu Jaolon. Your\nclassmate Lin Shiao also played a role.\nLynn Sha Khalil Jabbrron has always told\nme that Lin Shia is one of the future\nhopes of Lia and his current performance\nis quite remarkable besides his\nmysterious identity and numerous\nscandals and entanglements. Dugu Jalon\nsaid, \"But it's not necessarily a bad\nthing that we all know about the ancient\ndemons.\" And then there's the demon\nrace, his strange troops and heroes and\nhis abilities. Duga Nanuang said,\n\"Although I'm covering for him, do you\nreally believe his lord talent is only\nF- level, even with your SS level talent\nand my secret support, you still always\nlag behind him in the battle of 10,000\nraces.\" Auntie, that's because my talent\nhasn't been fully developed yet. Dugu\nJaolan retorted unconvinced. He Shaolan,\nyour talent is very useful, so be sure\nnot to forget to practice. Dugu Nanuang\naffectionately stroked Dugu Jaon&lt;unk&gt;s\nhair and smiled. Grow up quickly. The\nfuture domain lord position is reserved\nfor you. So Annie promised me I'd also\ntournament. Yes, the Dugo family has\nalways been at the forefront. It's good\nto gain more experience. Besides, my\nsister and brother-in-law kept it a\nsecret very well. No one knows that you\nare their descendant. However, I have\nanother task for you as well. Just as\nthe two stunning beauties of the Dugu\nfamily were discussing matters and Ding\nLay and Tu Sha by Chin and the others\nwere enthusiastically selecting a lord.\nLynn Sha returned to the lord&lt;unk&gt;'s\nmansion. That's how it happened. Jinglu.\nDo you have any suggestions? Whenever\nthere are unresolved matters, whether\ninternal or external, we can consult\nWong Ming. Lyn Sha thought to himself.\nWong Mang stroked his thick beard and\npaced back and forth in the Lord&lt;unk&gt;'s\nmansion. I never imagined that this\nJapan would be so much stronger than I\nremembered, Wong Ming said. However, we\nshould meet force with force and water\nwith earth. The principle remains the\nsame. We should just deal with whatever\ncomes our way. Having said that, Wong\nMing stopped and slowly said, \"This\nmartial arts arena is divided into two\ncamps, one against the other and the\nother against each other. They fight\nsoldiers, generals, and lords, and the\ntournament is a single elimination draw.\nThe winners must continue to fight until\nthe final champion is determined. All\nparticipating units must be at least\nlevel 50. When it comes to fighting\nlords, it will inevitably be you, my\nlord, who will personally take the stage\nto deal with the enemy. Now that you are\nalready a level 48 lord, you have a week\nto upgrade to level 49 and take the lead\nin level. Then it depends on how well\nyou perform, my lord. To be honest, your\nmartial arts skills are already among\nthe best of the lords, and your\nequipment is impeccable, but just in\ncase, you still need to learn from young\nmaster pay and get yourself a better set\nof armor.\" Lyn Sha nodded. Although he\nhad an SSS level talent, his strength\nlay in his all-around abilities and\nlategame potential. In a one-on-one\nfight, he might not be able to defeat an\nS-level specialized combat lord. It's\nall right. I still have a trump card. I\ncan strengthen myself at any time. And\nyou'll see when the time comes. If he\nreally couldn't win, he could possess\nthe spirit of an emperor and become a lu\nshioer Xiang Ji or someone who could\ncrush his peers. Lyn Shao thought to\nhimself. Then I can rest assured, Wong\nMing continued. This duel is a contest\nof heroes and the one who will\nparticipate is undoubtedly Young Master\nPay Min. Wong Ming exclaimed. Young\nMaster Pi is the sword saint of the Tang\nDynasty. I have never seen anyone whose\nmartial arts can surpass Young Master\nPace. Lin Shia nodded in agreement. Pay\nMin is really strong in one-on-one\ncombat. This round is the most stable.\nIn the soldiers duel, 100 soldiers must\nbe selected to participate in the entire\narena competition. Soldiers cannot be\nchanged midway and they must fight until\nthe very end. There are so many unit\ntypes to choose from. Melee and ranged,\nphysical and magical, cavalry and\ninfantry, as well as ninjas, assassins,\nrangers, and more. Wongming pondered for\na moment and said, \"The troop type\nchosen for this level requires careful\nconsideration from our lord.\" Chapter\n177, summoning special forces,\noutwitting the Chinese order. Indeed,\nthe combat segment of the martial arts\narena was a considerable challenge for\nLin Sha. Lyn Sha possesses numerous\nlegendary golden units from China, each\nwith top tier strength, but none of them\nare truly well-rounded. There are the\nIron Guards of the Mod Dao, armored\nbrutes with maximum attack, defense, and\nhealth. One strike from them can shatter\nboth men and horses. However, the iron\nguards of the Mod Dao cannot fight on\nhorseback and have no ranged abilities.\nThe divine archer boasts incredible\ndefense and a maximum range of 500 me.\nThey are also formidable in close combat\nrivaling legendary melee units. However,\nthe divine archer is not a cavalry unit\nand lacks speed and agility. White spear\nspearmen are powerful attackers with\nlong spears and great swords. They also\ncarry bows and can use ranged weapons as\nsecondary weapons. Their ranged\nabilities are comparable to epic\narchers. They are also a mobile unit\nthat thrives in the mountains. However,\nWhite Spear spearman cannot ride horses\nand their defense is somewhat lacking.\nThe Guan Ning iron cavalry as a cavalry\nunit was quite well-rounded, possessing\nranged and melee combat skills,\nproficient in musketss, bows and arrows,\nspears, shortsords, and horseback\nriding. However, the Guan Ning iron\ncavalry could not fight on foot, which\nwas a weakness, and their defense was\nnot as good as that of the heavy\ninfantry emo dao iron guards and shimi\narchers. If the battle area is\nrelatively small, the cavalry will be\nunable to maneuver effectively. Lynn Sha\nshook his head. There was also the great\nHan Champion cavalry here and after\nreferred to as the champion cavalry.\nThis was an exclusive cavalry unit\nrecruited by Hoitzubing. They were good\nat long distance raids, extremely fast,\nand their bows and horse equipment were\nsuperb. They were the ace of field\nbattles, but similarly, their defense\nwas not enough. They were only\nconsidered top level light cavalry. They\nalso had no way to use their strength in\nsmall battlefields. The ranger, Payman's\nexclusive unit, is indeed very strong.\nIn a one-on-one battle, no one among his\nlegendary units can defeat it. Lynn\nShiao even suspects that the rangers\nattributes are close to those of a\nmythical unit. However, the recruitment\nspeed for rangers is too slow and the\ncurrent number is still too small, only\na dozen or so. A dozen or so rangers\nwould take turns attacking and each of\nthem would experience combat intensity\n10 times that of a normal soldier.\nSecondly, the range class is somewhat\nlacking in both ranged ability and\ndefense and may encounter kiting\ntactics. This is a martial arts arena\nwhere both sides will fight to the death\nagainst Japan, not a friendly one-on-one\nsparring match. Lynn Shiao and Wong Ming\nboth agreed that the selection of troops\nshould be as full as possible. After\nall, this is a battle between nations,\nand Japan will definitely take it very\nseriously. As a long-established\nsuperpower, the types of troops they\nproduce should have a great many of epic\nand legendary quality. Furthermore, in\naccordance with their style of killing\ntheir own lords for the sake of resource\ncompetition, the participating troops\nwere to be a mix of ranged, melee,\nphysical, magical, cavalry, and assassin\nunits along with a number of suicide\nunits. As long as we discover that Lia\nhas powerful troops, we can use suicidal\ntroops to deplete Lia&lt;unk&gt;s troops, and\nvictory will be a piece of cake. After\nmuch deliberation, Lyn Sha realized that\nnone of his current unit types seemed\ncapable of reliably winning the match\nfrom the very beginning through a series\nof battles. Lyn Sha paced back and\nforth. I need special forces soldiers.\nSpecial forces? Wong Ming asked puzzled.\nThe elite of the elite, proficient in\nalmost all combat methods, Lin Shao\nsaid. And also able to form battle\nformations. Only soldiers of this type\ncan have the last laugh in the arena of\nmartial arts. Wong Ming, a military\nstrategist, asked with puzzlement,\n\"According to the rules of the\nbattlefield of all races, recruitment\ntokens are for a single type of soldier.\nCould it be that Lord wants to recruit a\nnew type of soldier that meets your\nrequirements?\" \"That's right. We&lt;unk&gt;ll\nrecruit again.\" Lyn Sha quickly checked\nhis myriad races battlefield energy and\nnodded. He had used up all the myriad\nraces battlefield energy when recruiting\nWong Mang, but now he had several\nthousand units left, which should be\nenough to make a gamble. Lyn Shia took\nout the recruitment token. Use Hasha\nsummoning to consume one energy point\nand summon a Hasha exclusive unit.\nContinue to consume the energy of the\nbattlefield of myriad races and set the\nconditions for this Hasha summoning.\nRoll call. Baywei army. Ding. Your Hasha\ntoken energy is insufficient. As\nexpected, recruiting several thousand\nBey warriors wouldn't be enough. Lyn Sha\nthought to himself. Beway army was the\nelite force within Eufay's army. On\nhorseback, they were heavy cavalry\ncapable of charging into battle. On\ndismount, they were heavy infantry able\nto form ranks and fight. They could also\nuse the divine crossbow for ranged\nattacks. They once decisively defeated\ntens of thousands of enemy troops under\nWu with only a few hundred soldiers.\nChange the targeted summons to iron\neagle warrior. Ding exclusive unit\nalready exists in the current dragon\nsummer world. Cannot be summoned again.\nLyn Sha was taken aback. There were\nstill troop types that he couldn't\nrecruit with his hasha token. There are\nalso exclusive troop types that already\nexist in the dragon summer world. The\nIron Eagle warriors been passed down to\nthis day. Lynn Zhao&lt;unk&gt;s mind raced. He\nthought of something but quickly moved\non from it as the current matter was the\nmost important. Changed the targeted\nsummons to Wei Wu Zu. Ding. Your Hasha\ntoken energy is insufficient. Lyn Shia\nshook his head. Hua Ling, you're too\narrogant. The Chinese troops in your\nChinese token are all legendary level.\nJust those few dozen troops. If I just\ndraw randomly, I'll eventually draw the\ntroops I want. You're charging such a\nhigh price for a targeted summon. Then\nI'll take a gamble. Lynn Shiao changed\nthe recruitment conditions for the\nHashia order again. Requirement one for\nthis event is a powerful unit capable of\nboth ranged and melee combat with top\ntier attack, defense, speed, and\nstamina. Requirement two, able to serve\nas both cavalry and infantry.\nRequirement three, able to carry out\nspecial missions and also able to form\nbattle formations and fight tough\nbattles on the battlefield. The\nrecruitment talisman flew into the sky.\nA portal appeared and a troop of\nsoldiers materialized. In the hazy\nlight, it was clear they were clad in\nheavy armor, each holding a horse with\nlong bows and spears slung across their\nbacks and various other weapons at their\nwaists. Ding! You have successfully\nrecruited the soldier using the\nrecruitment token. Meanwhile, at the\ncity lord's mansion on the arena set up\nby Ding Lei and his group, dozens of\npeople had already passed the test.\nAmong them were a group of lords who\nwith Lin Shao. Zuli, Wong Bo, Shufunga,\nGuang Jun, Shunuandu, and others all\ncame. While Pans Shan Yu and Lu Jaoying\nwho were resource type lords were\npersuaded to leave by Dinglay. Firstly,\nthey are not good at fighting. Secondly,\nresource-based lords are indeed more\nvaluable and should contribute their\nenergy in the rear. In addition, there\nare some new experts. Anyone else want\nto join? He asked breathlessly. He had\nalready defeated several lords and was\nnow both excited and exhausted. Who\ndefeat him? Tu Shan by Chian and Chin\nNingming are qualified to challenge Ding\nLay. Haha. Is there anyone else who\nwants to test their skills against me?\nTu Shan by Chian stood on the arena,\nhands on her hips, looking smug. We\nalways thought we were weak, but after\narriving in the official area, we\nrealized that we are already considered\nstrong. He whispered to Tan by Chin with\nemotion. It's all because we have a good\nboss. Tu Shan by Chin nodded. Of course,\nmy little sister herself is also very\npowerful. Sha, with your skill level, I\nbet the other guys just don't want the\nfight to get in the way of your Lolita\noutfit and embarrass you. Then I'm still\nbetter than you. As the two were\nbickering, a figure slowly approached.\nHe was tall and thin and slowly raised\nhis head. I also want to participate in\nthis martial arts arena. Who are you?\nLynn douching. Tu Shan by Chin and Heay\nexchanged a glance. They couldn't\nrecognize the person in front of them,\nbut the name seemed somewhat familiar.\nChapter 178. The addition of two first\nplace winners. Lynn Douching. Lynn\nDouching. The two exchanged a glance and\nshrugged. I think I've heard of it, but\nyou also need to pass the test to\narena. Sorry. We need capable people to\nguarantee our chances of winning. I\nunderstand. Please make your move. Lynn\nDouching said expressionlessly, his\nemotions completely unaffected. No\nassessment is needed. He conjoined\ndirectly. A voice came from behind. It\nwas Ding Lay. The tall and imposing Ding\nLay walked slowly towards us with a\nsmile on his face. Lynn Douching, the\nfirst genius lord to enter the official\nzone in the Lan region last year. Later,\ndue to certain events, I chose to become\nan official in the Lan district as a\nreserve cadre. Although my leveling\nspeed slowed down, my strength was still\nthere. People like this don't need to be\nassessed to participate in this\ncompetition. Dinglay extended his hand\nand shook hands with Lind Douching. It's\nan honor to meet you. Lynn Daoing&lt;unk&gt;s\nexpression remained unchanged and he\nnodded slightly to Ding Lay. I didn't\nexpect anyone would still remember me,\nthe person who became dejected after\nentering the official area. Dinglay\nlaughed and said, \"I remembered the\nnames of all the geniuses from the\nprevious year because I originally\nwanted to be one of them. You have\nalready achieved it,\" Lin Daoing said\ncalmly. \"Certainly,\" Dinglay responded\nwith a smug look. A smuggness that even\nmade Lin Dao, who had been calm and\ncollected, pause for a moment. \"By the\nway, as an official of Lan District, why\nare you participating in the martial\narts arena? I became an official\nnaturally for my ideals and now I'm\nparticipating in the martial arts arena\nnaturally for my ideals as well. I never\nexpected that last year's top ranked\nnewbie lord would be an idealist. A\nclear melodious voice drifted over from\nafar. However, I think your\nparticipation in the heroic martial arts\narena has more to do with that, doesn't\nit? Ding Li and Lin Daoing turned around\nat the same time and a stunningly\nbeautiful figure dressed in purple\nslowly walked over. Dug Jalon, the first\nperson from Lan District to be promoted\nto a formal district this year. Dinglay\nlooked at Lin Daoing, then at Dugu Jaon.\nHis expression a mixture of confusion\nand surprise. Two top masters have\narrived at the same time. Could it be\nthat they both want to join the heroic\nmartial arts arena? Lin Daoing looked at\nDugu Jaolan who was slowly walking\ntowards him and suddenly smiled saying\ncalmly, \"The Lord's Mansion in Lan City,\nbroadcasting the entire conflict with\nYamamoto Isuroku. The officials of the\nentire Lan district were furious. In the\nend, the result of my punishment was\nthat I was asked to participate in this\nheroic martial arts arena. You're the\none who started the live stream.\" Ding\nLay and the others were all surprised.\nIt is indeed I, Lynn Douching said\nproudly, bowing slightly. Boss, please\naccept my bow. Heay immediately stepped\nforward. I've always admired brother Lin\nShiao and now I want to say I admire you\ntoo. Tu Shan by Chin followed suit. The\nusually tacetern Chin Ningming also\nturned his head and gave Lynn Douching a\nserious look. In recent times, Lynn\nShiao has undoubtedly been the most\ntalked about person. He first defeated\nthe celestial beings organization leader\nwho had descended from the broken zone\nwith the abilities of a novice lord and\nwiped out the entire legendary and epic\nlegion of black flame. He left behind\nthe inspiring and bold statement. Since\nthere are no more torches, I am the only\nlight which shocked the entire LN\ndistrict. Upon entering the official\nzone, they immediately won the resource\ncompetition, exposed Kenzo Dohura's\nconspiracy, and ruined his reputation.\nIt also brought 10 times the resource\nrewards and luck charms that increased\nlifespan and resources to everyone in\nthe LN region. Then, in the city lord's\nmansion, in front of tens of millions of\npeople watching the live broadcast, he\nangrily rebuked the Japanese envoy and\naccepted the challenge of the martial\narts arena. He was immediately promoted\nby Lord Dugu to the position of deputy\ncity lord of Lnon City who have entered\nthe battlefield of 10,000 races in\nrecent years and everything he does\nattracts the attention of thousands of\npeople. He himself never makes a\nmistake. His words and actions are\nconsistent and he is both passionate and\ncomposed. Lynn Shiao has already become\nan idol for young lords in recent years.\nAnd the person who started the live\nstream is the unsung hero that everyone\nis looking for. It was he who made the\nscene of Lin Sha speaking out for\njustice spread online, exposing the\nconspiracy of the Japanese. It was he\nwho enraged Lord Dugu, who ordered Chu\nYusi to deal with more than a dozen\nofficials on the spot, rectify the\natmosphere in the Lan region, and bring\nthe L non region together as one again.\nLynn Douching did all of this. Just\nstarting a live stream. Why are you\nbeing asked to enter the heroic martial\narts arena? This punishment is quite\npeculiar, Dinglay asked, puzzled. This\nis the result of Lord Dugu's strenuous\nefforts. Lynn Douching said calmly.\nBecause of my live broadcast, the\nofficials of the entire Lan district\nmade a fool of themselves and were\ncriticized by the Lord and the people.\nMy actions have greatly affected the\nstability of the Lan district,\ninfuriating these officials. Lynn\nDouching smiled faintly. They are\nobsequious to outsiders, but they still\nhave some skills and methods when it\ncomes to internal affairs. Even though\nboth Lord Chu and Lord Dugu have stated\nthat they will not pursue the matter,\nsome officials still brought up certain\nregulations and articles to punish me.\nIt was Lord Dugu who was well-versed in\nlegal principles and found a way for me\nto redeem myself. I see. Dingle and the\nothers all shook their heads inside. Lin\nDaoing&lt;unk&gt;s secret live broadcast\nexposed the Japanese conspiracy and\nunited the people of Long Nan district\nto fight against the enemy. But this\nalso slapped the face of those\nincompetent officials. So he was\nostracized and forced to participate in\nthis martial arts arena. Don't worry,\nalthough I took a minor official\nposition to improve the atmosphere when\nI first entered the official district,\nand my strength hasn't improved quickly\nenough, I still have the ability and\nwon't hold anyone back. Then welcome to\njoin us. Ding Li and the others\nregistered Lynn Douching. Do you want to\nparticipate in a duel, a contest of\nsoldiers or generals or a duel? I'll\nparticipate. Me too. I'm joining the\nheroic arena this time. However, I only\nparticipate in duels and duels. Dugu\nJaon, who was standing to the side, also\nsaid calmly. Welcome, welcome. Dinglay\nlaughed heartily. The winners from last\nyear and this year are here, which\nincreases our chances of winning even\nmore. Brother Lin Shia will be so happy\nto have two such powerful ally figures.\nTu Shan by Chin interjected. If we all\nhelp brother Lynn Shia clear out the\nweaker opponents, he'll be able to win\nthe championship more easily. Lynn\nDouching and Dug Jaolon exchanged a\nglance and both smiled. I'm helping the\nLon region. If we can fight to the end,\nI won't give up the championship. The\nDuga family is never satisfied with\nsecond place. Oh, Tu Shan by Chin stood\nthere stunned. He could only smile\nawkwardly and pull her away, whispering,\n\"Geniuses are all proud and arrogant.\nHow can you directly say that they are\nnot as good as boss Lyn Sha? Tell me\nquietly.\" Lynn douching. Hey, you kid\nwith dark circles under your eyes. I can\nhear you. A few days later, the prelude\nto this national destiny contest, which\nhas attracted the attention of billions\nof people, the heroic martial arts\narena, officially began. At the border\nbetween the two countries under the\nwatchful eyes of Dugu Jaolan and Tojo\nHideayaki, the chief strategist of the\nEastern Kingdom, the main god system\nslowly lowered a massive multi-purpose\narena. Chapter 179. The battle begins.\nRonin appeared. As the ring slowly\ndescended, the contestants from both\ncountries entered the arena. At a great\ndistance, Dug Nanuang and Donga Inkuan\nlistened to the message from the god\nsystem and nodded in confirmation once\nagain as leaders of a nation, officially\nopening the heroic arena. In an instant,\nall channels in the Lan region and even\nthe entire Lang Sha Kingdom started\nbroadcasting live, showing this\ncompetition between elite young people\nfrom two great nations. The giant arena\nbegins to slowly fold, only appearing\nwhen the corresponding scene is used,\neventually leaving only the most basic\narea to display the two people fighting\nin the arena. The heroic arena descends\nupon the border between the two nations\nof the battle of 10,000 races. There are\nno live spectators. All battles are\nbroadcast live by the main god system.\nEach country sends a team accompanied by\na team leader with the rest of the\nparticipants being participating lords,\nheroes, and troops. When the main god\nsystem determines that one side has\nlost, the battle will only end when the\nparticipating lord or team leader\nvoluntarily concedes defeat. The\njudgment criteria of the god system are\ngenerally very broad and it often stops\nthe fight only after one side has\nalready died. This is one of the reasons\nwhy the heroic martial arts arena is so\nbrutal. The basic terrain gradually took\nshape and the lords of both sides\ngradually became clearly visible. It's\nhere. It's here. In longa's various live\nstreams, quite a few people were paying\nattention to this matter and some people\nimmediately started shouting excitedly.\nWow, so many new faces. There are so\nmany people I don't recognize. Of\ncourse, only those below level 50 can\nparticipate in the heroic arena. So,\nit's mostly new lords from the last few\nyears. Moreover, most of them are from\nthe Lan region. It's normal that you\nfrom Long Bay don't recognize them\nbecause the Lan region started this\nwhole thing. So, the Lan region took the\ninitiative to shoulder the\nresponsibility. From the live stream\nperspective, the lords from the Lan\nregion participating in this competition\nwaited quietly in a hall. They were\neither sitting or standing, showing no\nsigns of tension and appearing very\nrelaxed. Holy crap, I saw an absolutely\ngorgeous woman. Someone with sharp eyes\nshouted, \"That's the top ranked rookie\nlord in the Lan region this year, Dugu\nJaolon.\" A voice reminded them. It's the\nDugu family. One of the four great\nfamilies of Langsha Kingdom. They're\nfrom the same family as our domain lord.\nThe Dugu family is indeed powerful,\nproducing many great experts. That's\nLynn Douching over there. He was the\nnumber one rookie lord in the Lan region\nlast year. In the live stream, Dugu\nJaolan, dressed in purple, resembled a\nserene and aloof lotus flower, radiating\na dazzling light that made it difficult\nto look directly at her. Regardless of\nher actual strength, everyone watching\nthe live stream could tell that she was\nthe most beautiful new lord of the year.\nM Dingle, Chufunga, Guang Jun, Shenda,\nJulie, and Wong Bo are all experts. This\nperson then began to list the other top\ncompetitors. It's best not to lose these\nexperts. They are all promising\ncandidates for future Chief Lords. Wow,\nthere's also a busted girl wearing\nanimal ears and white Lolita stockings.\nI'm drooling. Be serious. That's Lin\nXiao's vassel Lord Tu Shan Chien. Tan by\nChian. Then the man with dark circles\nunder his eyes next to her must be he.\nHe really does look like he has kidney\ndeficiency. These people are here to\narena. Aren't they qualified? Anyway, it\nwas all arranged by Lin Shao. Lyn Shiao\nis the deputy city lord of Lan City in\ncharge of this martial arts arena. His\nstatus is only below the team leader Chu\nYusi. Oh, Lyn Shao is out. In the live\nbroadcast room, Lin Shao slowly walked\nover. He first came to Lin Dao Chung and\nthe two exchanged pleasantries. Then Lin\nSha came to Dugu Jaolan and talked to\nher. \"What a perfect couple,\" someone\nexclaimed. \"Indeed, Dugu Jaolan is\nexceptionally beautiful and Lin Shiao is\nhandsome and imposing, the two standing\ntogether are truly a feast for the eyes.\nUnfortunately, the Dugu family is a\npowerful clan. Even if Dugu Jaolon is\njust an ordinary member of the family,\nit is not something that a commoner like\nLin Sha can get his hands on.\" H\ncommoner? Hasn't Lynn Shiao already\nbecome the deputy city lord? We're still\nquite far from the Dugu family. All\nright, stop arguing. Let's look at\nJapan. Holy crap. Isn't that Sakura\nShikaru and Roland, too? Weren't they\nlocked up in prison? How did they get\nout? From another live stream\nperspective, dozens of Japanese\ncontestants were kneeling upright on the\nground with their team leader, Yamamoto\nIsuroku, holding a samurai sword and\nsternly reprimanding them. Among these\nlords kneeling on the ground were\nSakura, Shichiro, and Roland, who had\ncommitted heinous crimes in the resource\ncompetition. The Japanese are really\nstubborn. Aren't they afraid these two\nwill continue to kill their own kind?\nMaybe they're just being used as cannon\nfodder. Hei, Sakura, Shichiro, and\nRoland are both lords with S-class\ntalents. It's impossible to leave them\nand used. As for how to use them,\nwhether to redeem them or to use them in\nthe death row camp, it all depends on\nthe Japanese leader arrangements.\nEveryone agreed that this made sense.\nAnd then they looked at the ID. Gene\nWuang, what are you doing here again?\nWhy can't I come? You, the chief lord,\nhave way too much free time. Don't you\nneed to be stationed and fighting\noutside? I am merely an avatar, Gene\nWuang said smuggly. This is one of my\nsignature techniques. Oh, I see. It's a\nclone with no combat power. The kind\nthat Lin Sha completely ignored on the\nspot. Gene Wuang. The live stream was\nnoisy, and everyone seemed to have\ngotten used to the unpretentious,\nknowledgeable, and somewhat amusing\npatriarch of the Gene family. The fact\nthat Gene Wuang spoke up for Lin Sha\nback then shows that although he liked\nto laugh strangely, he didn't really\ntake Lin Xiao's past actions to heart.\nAll right, the ceremony in Japan is\nfinally over. Dozens of lords from the\neast sea drank the wine in front of\nthem, smashed it on the ground, tied\nwhite cloth strips around their\nforeheads, and had ferocious\nexpressions. Hey, they shouted in\nunison. Their momentum was astounding.\nEveryone exclaimed in amazement. This is\nthe Bushidto spirit of Japan. Their\nfighting will is extremely strong. The\nfirst phase of the heroic arena and the\nspecialized arena has officially begun.\nfighting soldiers. The god system has\nbegun selecting lords, starting the\nelimination rounds. The radiance fell\nupon a lord of the eastern kingdom. The\nlord stepped forward, shouted loudly,\nand those around him clenched their\nfists to cheer him on. Go, let dragon\nkingdom witness the true power of an\neastern superpower. Let the remnants of\nLangia's army witness the power of my\nJapanese soldiers. With a flash of\nlight, the lord vanished and reappeared\nin a wilderness, the wilderness arena.\nThe participating lords are surrounded\nby an invisible light curtain from the\ngod system and suspended in midair. They\ncan only summon their own troops in\ncommand and watch their troops, but they\ncannot participate in the battle\nthemselves. He simply waved his hand and\n100 Japanese ronin appeared. I, Honda\nToyurro, along with my fellow Japanese\nRonin, challenge you all. People of Lang\nShia Kingdom, make your move. Everyone\nshifted their attention to Lia's side\nwhere light flowed and the god system\nwas selecting people. Lyn Shia raised\nhis foot and kicked he in the butt. It's\nyour turn. Then the radiance of the\nSupreme God fell precisely on Heay.\nChapter 180. A shocking surprise. The\nflower fairy makes a great contribution.\nHeay was kicked away by Lin Sha and just\nthen the light of the god system shone\non him causing him to disappear into the\nair. When it reappeared, it was already\non a desolate battlefield. He sporting\ntwo huge dark circles under his eyes\nlooked around blankly. Is it my turn\nalready? Across from him, Honda Toyurro\nglared and shouted, \"Who goes there?\nState your name. He never heard of it.\"\nHonda Fuji Chiro shook his head. My unit\nis the epic unit, the Japanese Ronin.\nEvery one of them is a Japanese samurai,\nhighly skilled in martial arts and\nfearless in the face of death. What\nclass of soldier are you? He scratched\nthe back of his head, summoned his 100\nflower fairies, and said guilty, \"Are\nthey elite troops?\" \"What? Flower\nfairies? Elite troops dare to\nparticipate? You really don't know the\nimmensity of heaven and earth. Eay gave\na ry smile. I don't understand either.\nThe boss tells me to go, so I go anyway.\nI don't have to fight. Honda Toyurro\nsneered. I see you don't take this arena\nbattle seriously. Then I'll send your\nflower fairy on her way sooner. Honda\nToyurro waved his hand. And 100 Japanese\nRonin, shouting and grinning menacingly,\ncharged forward. The live stream room,\nwhich was just filled with anticipation,\nis now in complete chaos. Lia actually\nsent he and they used the flower fairy,\na highly skilled soldier who is good for\nnothing but beauty. How can we fight\nlike this? A ronin could kill the\nthree-headed flower demon with a single\nslash. Lyn Shia, is the Lia team just\nmessing around? The flower fairies were\nstill looking at each other, completely\nbewildered. My lord, Yao Yao is still\nsleeping. What's wrong? The charging\nronin had already swiftly swung his\nsword and killed the outermost flower\nfairy. Pathetic, Honda Toyurro said\ndisdainfully. Demons, fight them. I'll\ntreat you to a feast in my next life.\nSeeing the flower fairy being chased by\nthe ronin and thinking that this was the\nfirst battle of the heroic martial arts\narena with countless people watching his\nperformance, he raised his arm and\nshouted, \"This is boring.\" The sleepy\nflower fairies were chased away by the\nJapanese Ronin and few of them were\ninterested in fighting back. \"Fight,\nI'll give you 3 days off in your next\nlife.\" He then patiently guided him. Yao\nYao is naturally good at slacking off\nand lacks motivation. Then I will ask a\nmagician to fertilize the roots of your\nplants. Huh? Last time it was that old\nlecher who came leerously splashing\nwater on people. Yao Yao, a proper\nsoldier, doesn't like that at all. In\nthe live stream, everyone couldn't help\nbut put their hands to their foreheads.\nWhat the hell is this farce? You keep\nsaying next life all the time. Is this\nhow you motivate your troops to fight?\nHonda Fujiaro couldn't help but taunt.\nEven if your flower fairy dares to fight\nback, what can she do? Weak elite troops\nsimply cannot break through the defenses\nof my epic troops. I think the only use\nof flower fairies is to be sold to\nbrothel in my great Japanese empire as\nservice staff. Huh? You damned old\nJapanese bastard. A flower fairy cursed\nas she ran away. Although Yao Yao is\nvery adventurous, she can only touch\nthings that Yao Yao likes. Yao Yao only\nlikes lords and dukes. Hearing this,\nHeay, who was exhausted from shouting,\nsuddenly had a sudden thought. Fight\ndemons. If you fight with all your\nmight, I'll let you touch my boss Lin\nXiao&lt;unk&gt;s abs in your next life. Huh?\nAll the flower fairies present stopped\nand looked at he in disbelief. Yay,\nthat's great. Charge sisters, fight for\nglory. Before Honda, Fuji Chiro, and the\nJapanese Ronin could react, the flower\nfairies that had been fleeing suddenly\nturned back and swiftly unleashed a\nbarrage of poisonous seeds at the\nJapanese Ronin. What? This cowardly\nflower fairy isn't fleeing, but is\nactually approaching my troops. Caught\noff guard, dozens of Japanese Ronin were\ndirectly hit by the poison gas and began\nto bend over and cough. Baka the\nJapanese Ronin who had been ambushed by\nthe flower fairy coughed a few times but\nquickly recovered and was furious with\nembarrassment. How dare you, my esteemed\nepic unit. Insult me. Prepare to die.\nWith a single stroke, the Japanese Ronin\nkilled another flower demon. These\nJapanese ronin are all powerful Japanese\nsamurai who have been defeated in\nbattle. Although their strength has not\nreached the golden legend level, they\nshould not be underestimated. Gene Wuang\nthen explained, \"The reason Japan send\nout Ronin is mainly because they value\ntheir fearless nature and the methods of\ndesperat. No matter which type of unit\nLia chooses, the Ronin can inflict\nextremely fierce losses on Lshia's\nunits. Even if Lia produces a golden\nlegendary character, it may be lost due\nto the Ronin's exhaustion and its\nstamina may be severely reduced. It is\nvery likely that it will not be able to\nlast in the next battle.\" This is the\nJapanese tactic. If Lia sends out\npowerful troops at the beginning, they\nwill be worn down like this and will not\nbe able to achieve final victory. And\nthe weaker troops are no match for the\nJapanese Ronin. Lia's side is quite\nclever. They directly send out the\nflower fairy. Since they're going to\nlose anyway, they might as well use the\nflower fairy to minimize their losses.\nGene Wuang&lt;unk&gt;s words resonated with\neveryone in the chat channel. So that's\nhow it is. The lords of Lshia do have\nbrains after all. Breaking the morale of\nthe Japanese is also a good tactic. But\nbefore he could finish speaking, a\nflower fairy on the battlefield suddenly\nexploded. Yao Yao wants to be the first\nto touch the lord's abs. The flower\nspirit charged into the ranks of the\nronin, scattering poisonous seeds before\nsuddenly exploding. Bang! Purple\npoisonous mist sprayed out, and the\nforce of the explosion knocked over a\ngroup of Ronin. Uh my eyes. A group of\nronin were blown to the face by the\nflower demon and rolled on the ground in\npain. What? Honda Fujiro was shocked\nagain. Shameless. They actually used\nunit self-destruction to wear me down.\nDefense. Defense. With these shouts, the\nRonin quickly formed ranks. But the\nflower fairies didn't give them a\nchance. One by one, they fearlessly\nrushed forward and self-destructed.\nBaka, how come they aren't afraid of\ndeath? Have they really been bewitched?\nThe ronin's formation was thrown into\nchaos, and the flower fairies kept\nspraying poisonous seeds to confuse\ntheir vision before self-destructing.\nThe sounds of explosions mingled with\nthe laughter of the flower fairies and\nthe jostling and pushing of them. Me\nfirst. Me first. I'll go first.\nSuddenly, Honda Toarro noticed that the\nronin poisoned by the flower demon were\nin increasing pain. And those whose eyes\nwere blasted out were no longer moving\nand had died. Shameless. Honda Fuji\nChurro wanted to admit defeat, but all\nthe flower fairies self-destructed in\nthat short time. All the Ronin were\nstunned by the explosion. Although they\nonly suffered minor injuries, they were\nall poisoned by the flower demon. I\nsurrender. I surrender. Honda Toyurro\nshouted. Battle over. He the contestant\nfrom Long Sha Kingdom has lost all his\nunits and is declared the loser. The\nvoice of the main god system came\nthrough. Honda Fujiro quickly ran\ntowards his unit. On the ground, nearly\nhalf of the Japanese Ronin were lying\ndown while the other half were rolling\naround in pain and howling. Baka,\nthey're all poisoned. Quickly, take them\nback to our territory for treatment.\nWith a flash of light, Honda Toyurro and\nthe remaining Ronin all disappeared.\nDing! Player Honda Toyurro has withdrawn\nfrom the battle and will be unable to\nparticipate in subsequent arena matches.\nThe next match begins. Everyone was\nshocked. Chapter 181. Falling into a\ndisadvantageous position, Lin Shiao\nmakes his appearance. The first match on\nthe martial arts arena shocked the\npeople of both countries. This is truly\na series of unexpected twists and turns,\nsomeone murmured. I originally thought\nthe flower fairy was used to mess with\nthe Japanese mentality, but I didn't\nexpect the flower fairy to actually\nwork. When I saw the flower fairy go up,\nI thought it was a hidden unit, but I\ndidn't expect it still couldn't defeat\nthe Japanese Ronin. I thought the flower\nfairies were going to be completely\ndefeated, but they turned out to\nself-destruct, and they're also highly\npoisonous. The Japanese were so\nfrightened they immediately surrendered\nthinking the flower fairies were going\nto win. But then they all\nself-destructed and the battle was\ndeclared a loss. We thought the arena\nwas over, but their poison knocked out\nall the Ronin and the opposing lord also\ngave up the match. Did we actually make\na profit? We made a profit. Of course,\nwe made a profit, Gene Wuang said with\nsatisfaction. The superior flower fairy\nunit replaced 100 epic units. How could\nit not be profitable? Harah, we've also\ndampened the arrogance of those bastards\non the other side, making them afraid to\nuse such underhanded tactics again.\nThat's a win. Yes, Lord Long Lia did a\ngreat job. When dealing with enemies,\nyou have to be even more ruthless than\nthem. Everyone agreed, but some were\nstill a little hesitant. It is really\ninhumane for the flower demon to\nself-destruct. Oomph. The heroic martial\narena is inherently a place of extreme\nviolence. Since we're going to die\nanyway, it's worth it to take such a\nstrong enemy down with us. If I were\nHeay, I would burn some paper money for\nthe flower fairies as a reward. No\nwonder that kid he always talks about\nthe next life. Someone realized\nrewarding flower fairies for their next\nlife. What kind of devilish way of\nboosting morale is this? It really is a\nnext life. They'll all self-destruct. By\nthe way, why did he say he would reward\nthe flower fairy by letting her touch\nLyn Xiao's abs in her next life? An\neerie silence fell over the live stream.\nIt seemed no one could answer the\nstrange question. Ahem, let's keep\nwatching the battle. The next contestant\nis about to enter. It's Lynn douching.\nThe main god systems combat phase\ninitially started as an elimination\ntournament where all lords who signed up\nfor combat would be selected to\nparticipate. The main god system will\nactively assess the strength of the\ncontestants and randomly select them\nfrom within a range. Of course, each\nparticipating team can also send its own\npeople. After the bizarre battle between\nthe flower fairies and epic troops, the\nJapanese dared not act rashly, fearing\nthat Lynn Sha might cause some further\ntrouble. They could only let the god\nsystem randomly select a lord.\nMeanwhile, in Langia, Lind Daing and a\nJapanese lord were also teleported to\nthe heroic battlefield at the same time.\nThis time, the battlefield is set in a\nsmall forest. Lind Douching smiled\nslightly and with a wave of his hand, a\n100 female fairies with elucory wings on\ntheir backs, wearing purpleointed soft\nhats, with dark skin and beautiful\nfigures flew out. What? Another flower\nfairy? The lords of Japan were\ntakenback. They were almost driven to\nPTSD by Heizay's self-destructing flower\ndemon. Upon closer inspection, it turned\nout to be a dream demon. This epic unit,\nwhich looks very much like a flower\nfairy, is almost the strongest among the\nfairy class. This time, the Eastern\nKingdom randomly selected a tall and\nmajestic lord who summoned the Nodachi\nsamurai, which is also an epic unit.\nJapan is really strong. Lynn Shiao, who\nwas watching the battle from the\nsidelines, said calmly. Both of the\nlords are epic level units. This is the\nfoundation of an old empire. Chu Yusi,\nwho was in charge of the team, was also\nwatching the match. He tilted his head\nand asked, \"Do you think Lin Daing has a\nchance of winning?\" \"Of course,\" Lin\nShao said. \"A person who can get first\nplace must have some skills.\" Sure\nenough, shortly after the battle began,\nthe dream demons took advantage of the\nfair's speed and high affinity with the\nforest to enter the forest and engage in\nbattle with the Nodachi samurai. Under\nLind Daing&lt;unk&gt;s command, the fairies\noutnumbered the enemy, gaining a local\nadvantage and slowly whittling down the\nnomadic katana warriors. In the end,\nLind Daing lost 12 dream demons, but\nannihilated the enemy army. The nodachi\nsamurai did not put much pressure on\nLind Daing at all. Dragon Sia Kingdom\nsecured a victory. I have fulfilled my\nmission. Lind Daoing said calmly upon\nreturning. You still have the strength\nto fight again. So, let's look forward\nto your performance in the second round.\nChu Yuzi was very pleased. The victory\nof Lia Kingdom greatly encouraged the\nviewers watching the live broadcast. And\namidst the cheers of the crowd, the\nthird elimination round began. The third\nmatch was still randomly selected. Lya's\nteam had a lord who had been selected by\nDing Lelay and others and he encountered\nIng Shichiro on the other side. Sakura\nShichiro S unit type is Tatommy archer,\na legendary gold unit and a renowned ace\narcher of the Eastern Kingdom. Although\ntheir range capabilities are similar to\nthose of the long bowman of the British\nEmpire, their range is not as long. But\nthe archers of the Far River region also\npossess a certain degree of melee combat\nability. As expected, Lord Lia had his\nhead shaved. The superior troops of Lia\ncouldn't even get close to the archers\nof Yuan Jang before they were riddled\nwith arrows. Damn it, what bad luck! We\nran into the enemy's ace. How can\nsomeone as guilty as Sakura Shichiro be\nallowed to participate in the heroic\nmartial arts tournament? Faced with the\ncrowd's righteous indignation, Gene\nWuang slowly said, \"In the current\nelimination rounds, someone will always\nencounter Sakura Shichiro. Luck doesn't\nmatter.\" As for the guilty, their crimes\nare committed by Japan, and their\ndecision to go on stage is also made by\nJapan. Victory is more important than\nanything else. Let's see what happens\nnext. Battle after battle ensued with\nLia's team giving their all against the\naggressive Japanese team. Each time when\nthe Japanese side selected a particular\nlord, Lin Shiao and Chu Yusi immediately\ncountered by using units that countered\neach other. When Liao went first, he\nchose to play randomly to avoid being\nexploited by the Japanese. However, over\nthe past 1 or 2,000 years, the\naccumulated knowledge and experience of\nthe developed countries of Japan have\nultimately been beyond the reach of the\nDragon Sea. Even though Lia had tried\nits best to develop tactics against\nJapan, the difference in the quality of\nits troops still made the outcome of the\nbattle extremely unpredictable. Apart\nfrom Chufinga's leopard berserker\nnarrowly defeating Roland's Japanese\nmonk soldiers, Dinglays Naga Queen\nnarrowly defeating the Japanese warrior\nninjas, and about 10 others, including\nJulie, Wong Bo, Chinuanandu, and Guang\nJun, achieving victories in the dueling\nrounds. All other lords suffered\ndefeats. Meanwhile, nearly 30 people in\nJapan have already achieved victory.\nThere's no way around it. The\nparticipating troops from Japan are\nmainly epic level or at the very least\nthe strongest among the excellent level\ntroops, and the five lords, including\nSakura Shichiro, are actually legendary\ngold tier units. Now, Chu Yusi will be\nunder a lot of pressure. Gene Wuang\ncommented, \"In the next round of battle,\nthese 10 or so people from Lang Shia\nKingdom will have to fight against\nnearly 30 people from Donging. On\naverage, each lord's troops have to\nfight three times as many enemies. If we\nwin, we must continue fighting until all\nunits are down. It seems we're going to\nlose the first round of the heroic\nmartial arts arena,\" Gene Wuang said,\nsomewhat disappointed. \"Old devil, have\nyou forgotten someone?\" A viewer bluntly\nreminded Gene Wuang, have you forgotten\nhow your descendants died? Gene Wuang,\nare you ever going to stop? If you dare\nbring this up again, I'll come down\nthrough the internet and refine you into\nthe 10,000 souls banner. All right, I\nforgot someone. There's still one person\nfrom Longa who hasn't played yet. He\ncreated several new types of soldiers\nand generously shared his training\nmethods. Although I haven't mastered\nthem yet, overalls have gone up in\nprice. Lynn Sha has made his appearance.\nChapter 182. The white armored Bayer\nmakes his debut. The light from the god\nsystem stopped flashing and landed\ndirectly on Lin Sha. Everyone held their\nbreath quietly anticipating what tricks\nthis young man on whom all the people of\nLshia had placed their hopes would pull.\nLyn Sha has arrived. Old demon, what\nkind of troops do you think he will send\nout? Guster, Cullinan, or Shining. Lynn\nShia, who was casually browsing the\ncomments in the live stream, almost\nburst out laughing. The Rolls-Royce\nmodel name and military unit that I made\nup myself are now being passed down by\nword of mouth and actually being used by\npeople. Lyn Sha shook his head slightly,\nwondering which name he would have to\nmake up this time. Some people have\nresearched Lynn Shiao and know that he\npreviously used a powerful and\nmysterious unit to defeat the Black\nFlame Legion, so they have some\nunderstanding of him. Gene Wuang\nchuckled twice, staring intently at the\nlive stream and said, \"I think Lyn Sha\nhas no problem winning once or twice\nwith his strength, but to win every time\nand keep winning until the end, I think\nit's a bit risky whether it's the Gust\nArcher Cullinan Iron Cavalry or the\nFlash Spirit Iron Guard. There are five\ngolden legendary units in Japan as well\nas so many powerful epic units. They\nwill definitely target Lin Xiao's units.\nSo, I'm also very much looking forward\nto seeing what type of troops Lin Sha\nwill use. On the opposite side, the\nentire Japanese team also knelt on the\nfloor with solemn expressions. The light\nfell on the last man, so the strongest\none is chosen last, huh? Sakura Shichiro\nmuttered unconvinced. As an S-rank\ntalent lord, his eyes never left the\neven more imposing man before him.\nYamamoto Isuroku approached the man and\nsolemnly handed him his sword. Toyottomy\nJinichiro Kuen, I beg you, the man stood\nup, bowed deeply, and accepted the\nsword. I will not fail in my mission. A\nflash of light and the man vanished. Lyn\nShiao and Toyottomy Jinichiro both\nappeared on the battlefield opened up by\nthe main god system. This is a\nbattlefield with complex terrain,\nincluding hills, streams, groves, and\nwilderness. Lynn Shao immediately\nspotted the extraordinary and murderous\nman opposite him. Lyn Shao, I am Toyi\nJenny. Please remember my name. I look\nforward to your guidance in the upcoming\nbattle. The information Shu Yusi had\ngiven Lynn Shiao quickly came to mind.\nToyottomy Jinichiro is one of the most\noutstanding young lords in Japan in all\nof Japan. The lord's talent is\nguaranteed to be at least srank and\nhigher talents are not out of the\nquestion. Born into one of the five\ngreat families of Japan, he was trained\nfrom a young age in combat skills,\nstrategy, tauist magic, knowledge, and\nmartial arts. And he had virtually no\nweaknesses. Take this. Toyottomy\nJinichiro summoned his own troops. fiery\nred vests, fiery red armor, fiery red\nbanners, and long spears in hand. It was\na heavily armored cavalry unit whose\nentire color scheme was red. The Teada\nRed Guard. The thought flashed through\nLinhao's mind. It's the Teada Red Guard,\nthe most powerful heavy cavalry in the\nJapanese Empire, capable of facing off\nagainst the three major European cavalry\nregiments. Moreover, they are more\nflexible, able to form formations to\ncharge the enemy or become skirmishers\nto harass them. Someone in the live\nstream exclaimed in surprise, \"This can\nbe considered one of the most amazing\ngolden legends in Japan. Where is Lyn\nShao? Is Lin Sha using the Flash Spirit\nIron Guard? The Flash Spirit Iron Guard\ncan counter heavy cavalry?\" Not\nnecessarily. Once a unit type is\nselected, it cannot be changed. If Lyn\nShiao chooses the Flash Spirit Iron\nGuard, he will be at a disadvantage\nagainst ranged and magic units. Look,\nLyn Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s troops are coming out. As\neveryone waited expectantly, Lyn\nXiao&lt;unk&gt;s troops emerged from the\nportal. This is a group of soldiers\ndressed in white armor and riding tall\nhorses. Their gleaming silver white\narmor covered their entire bodies,\nsomewhat like the Guan Ning cavalry, but\ndenser and thicker from their calves to\ntheir thighs to their groin, waist,\nbreastplate, handguards, shoulder\nguards, and helmets. All were uniformly\nwhite. The white helmets were topped\nwith long gun tips, and beneath them,\ntheir fierce eyes and scarred,\nrough-skinned faces were visible. Their\nfacial features were also quite unique\nwith higher foreheads and more prominent\njaws which combined with their sparse\nbeards left a deep impression on\neveryone. Some people in the live stream\ngasped when they saw these white armored\nwarriors appear as if a kind of fear was\ningrained in their blood. He's like a\ndevil, someone murmured. These white\narmored warriors rode on armored horses,\nbut their weapons were dazzlingly\nvaried. They carried long bows and long\nmusketss on their backs and had 70\narrows in their quivers at their waists.\nIn addition, he was equipped with a 4 m\nlong spear, a sword, a dagger, a short\naxe, a sickle, a pistol, short spear, a\nwhip, 40 hemp ropes, two woolen ropes,\nand four steel spears, javelin. These\nweapons, either hanging from the waist\nor tied to the horse, though numerous,\ndid not appear crowded in front of the\nburly combat troops. They had a full\nhundred riders which were quickly\nsummoned and lined up in formation. Lyn\nShiao, I do not kill nameless ghosts.\nWhat kind of soldiers have you summoned?\nMy Teada Red Guard will make them die\nknowing why. From afar, Toyotomy Jenny\nshouted, \"What are their names?\" Lyn\nShaol looked at the hundred white\narmored warriors with a complicated\nexpression, finally made up his mind,\nand said loudly, \"White armor Baya, it\nwould be their honor to die at the hands\nof the white armored Bayer.\" After the\nred guards on the other side have had\ntheir necks washed clean, the knight at\nthe head of Linhao&lt;unk&gt;s formation\nturned his head slowly to look at Lin\nSha upon hearing this, then lowered his\nhead and punched his chest. Then all the\nwhite armored knights turned around and\nbowed to Lynn Sha together. Calling them\nby their first names and allowing the\nwhite armored warriors to stand\ngloriously on the battlefield is a sign\nof the lord's recognition of them. Ding!\nYour unita Aguedin has reached 100%\nloyalty, ready to go through fire and\nwater. Upon hearing the notification\nfrom the main god system, Lyn Shao\nsilently nodded to the hundred white\narmored warriors. A god Buru, you will\ncommand this battle. Yes. The white\narmored warrior at the head of the group\nresponded in a horse voice. His voice\nsounded eerie and shrill as if it were\ncoming from two burnt broken gongs. Lyn\nSha sighed inwardly. He never expected\nthat the special forces soldier he\nrecruited would be by Jaayala. As a Han\nChinese and a history enthusiast, he had\nsome understanding of events in Chinese\nhistory, including how the Zu family was\nultimately destroyed in another version\nof China and how the Manchu Ching\ndynasty implemented policies such as\nkeep your head but not your hair, the 10\ndays massacre and the three massacres.\nLyn Sha believes that a large part of\nthe backwardness of modern Chinese\nhistory is due to the policies and\nactions of the backward Manchu rulers.\nTherefore, when this elite force from\nthe earlyQing dynasty appeared before\nLin Shiao, his thoughts were\ncomplicated. First, their own Guan Ning\ncavalry became restless. Faced with\ntheir mortal enemy, the Guan Ning\ncavalry were taken away by Hoy Sububing\nfor training, thus avoiding conflict.\nSecondly, this army composed of\nbarbarian tarter soldiers showed a\ncertain degree of maladjustment and\nvigilance on the battlefield of all\nraces, which was unprecedented.\nSecondly, after testing the combat\ncapabilities of this group of white\narmored Bayer, Lin Sha was extremely\nimpressed with their fighting prowess.\nChapter 183. Defeating cavalry with\ninfantry, white armored warriors,\nachieve merit. As an enemy, the power of\nBaala once made Lin Shiao, who was\nassociated with the Zhu family and the\nHan people, hate him to the core. But\nthen I thought, aren't the white armored\nBayera also a member of the great Hasha\nmilitary? This group of people were born\nin the northeast, lived and prospered in\nthe land of white mountains and black\nwaters, and ultimately fought for the\ngreater China. Even if the Manchus are\nbackward and ignorant, what does that\nhave to do with by Jia Alla, who is a\nwarrior in that other world? Didn't\nthese Mans eventually settle in the\nnortheast? Hundreds of years later, when\nthat great nation was founded, the\nnortheast became the eldest son of the\nrepublic, building heavy industry for\nthe motherland and creating that golden\nage together. Therefore, Lynn Shiao\nconvinced himself that he was now not\nonly a Hanchinese, but also a\nrepresentative of the entire Hasha\npeople in this other world. Since Huasha\nis a broad concept, the term can also be\nused to refer to the ethnic minorities\nof Hashia, specifically the Baala, who\nare part of Hashia. Aren't the White\nSpear spear soldiers also soldiers of\nthe southwestern barbarians? If we\nrecruit the Keshik cavalry in the\nfuture, they will be the trump card of\nthe Hanchinese and Mongol people. Such\ncapable soldiers. If we can use them,\nthen let's use them. With this in mind,\nLin Shao gladly accepted by Jaayala s\noffer to join him. Their squad leader\nwas named Urguna Agued, the first Peturu\nof Shung Jing. After receiving the\ninformation from the god system, he\nquickly led his soldiers to join Lyn\nXiao's territory and train with other\nwarriors. Only now has he made his first\nappearance, fighting against the Red\nGuard of the Eastern Kingdom. Opposite,\nthe Teada Red Guards were takenback when\nthey saw the white armored Bayer appear.\nThey were startled by their eerie\ndemeanor, strange faces, and fierce\nindifferent eyes. But they quickly\ncalmed down. They're just people on the\nother side. The mighty Teada Red Guard.\nWould they be afraid of the enemy? Don't\nbe frightened by their terrifying\nappearance. The Japanese cavalrymen\nencouraged each other and launched a\ncharge before Lin Xiao's white armored\ncavalry could finish preparing. Their\nprimary objective is the small hill in\nthe center of the battlefield. Once they\ncross the river and reach the highest\npoint of the hill, they can charge down\nthe long slope and use the immense\nmomentum of the cavalry to wipe out the\nenemy in one fell swoop. These white\narmored soldiers didn't even have a\nplace to run away from. There was a\nforest not far behind them, and if the\ncavalry entered the forest, they would\nbasically be doomed. The fiery redclad\nred guards spurred their war horses and\nquickly charged toward the small hill in\nthe center of the battlefield. At this\nmoment, Baijabayala slowly completed the\nformation. Are we going to lose? We're\nmoving so slowly. The opposing red\nguards are almost up the hill. In a\nbattle between two cavalry units,\nwhoever occupies the advantageous\nformation will gain the upper hand.\nThese white armored guys are\nintimidating in appearance and carry a\nlot of weapons. But do they actually\nhave any real skills? Lyn Shia has so\nmany powerful troop types at his\ndisposal. Why did he choose this\nparticular troop type for this battle?\nEven many people in the live stream\ndidn't have high expectations for the\nstrangely named white armor barrier unit\nin the waiting area of the martial arts\narena. Lyn Xiao's diehard fans,\nincluding two Shan by Chin, Ding Lelay,\nand Heay remained full of confidence.\nJust wait and see. If our boss dares to\nuse this type of soldier, it must be\nincredibly powerful. No one noticed that\nthe moment by Jaayalo appeared, Dugu\nJalon, who had not participated in the\nbattle and had been elegantly watching\nfrom the waiting area subtly narrowed\nhis pupils. When Lin Shao shouted by Jia\nBaya, Dugu Jaolan quietly sighed. On the\nbattlefield, Agden glanced indifferently\nat the Teada Red guards who were\nbeginning to climb the hill in the\ndistance, sneered, and opened his mouth\nto shout in strange words and tone. The\nBaija Bayer team began to change. The\nmen in white armor dismounted and drove\ntheir horses away. Then they shouldered\ntheir 4 m long spears and quickly\nassembled. Without the advantage of\ncavalry, are you simply giving up and\nbecoming infantry? Toyottomy. Jennyro\nsneered. Isn't this just giving up on\nyourself? The teada red guards had\nalready reached the top of the hill\nwhile the white armored soldiers had set\nup a spear formation at the bottom of\nthe hill. The Red Guard cavalry, without\na moment's rest, charged straight down.\nThe sound of hooves thundered as a\nhundred riders surged forward like a\nprimordial beast. It's no use. Even the\nfiery sunsp spearman can't stop the red\nguard cavalry. If Lyn Sha brought those\narmored soldiers with broadswords, that\nwould be fine. But this white armor, the\nteada red guards were less than 200 m\naway from the white armored soldiers. At\nthis moment, the formation of the white\narmored soldiers changed again. Except\nfor the white armored soldiers in the\nfront row, who maintained their spears\npointing diagonally, all the white\narmored soldiers simultaneously raised\ntheir giant bows, drew arrows from their\nquivers, and swiftly unleashed a volley\nof arrows, trying to launch a sneak\nattack with bows and arrows. What are\nyou going to do with the heavy armor of\nmy Teada Red Guard? of the charging\nTeada red guards fell. Half of the\narrows fired by the white armored\nsoldiers were light arrows aimed at the\ngaps in the armor of the red armored\nsoldiers and at their eyes and faces\nwhere they were not protected. The other\nhalf were heavy armor-piercing arrows\naimed directly at the vital points of\nthe cavalrymen. These soldiers in white\narmor are excellent archers. The red\nguards were no ordinary force. Although\nmore than a dozen men were shot down,\ntheir heavy armor and agile movements\nmeant that almost none of them were\nseriously injured or killed on the spot.\nThey quickly rolled off the ground to\navoid being trampled by the cavalry\nbehind them. The rear cavalry also\nslowed down slightly, allowing those who\nhad fallen to escape and to try to\nremount and charge the enemy. At this\nmoment, another volley of arrows rained\ndown from the white armored soldiers and\nmore than a dozen knights fell along\nwith more than a dozen war horses. Warh\nhorses are less defensive than warriors.\nIf shot down, they die instantly. These\nwhite armored soldiers shoot arrows\nhorizontally at such high speeds that\ntheir trajectories are impossible to\npredict. Of the red guards shouted,\n\"Baka, charge forward. Forget about\nthose who have fallen from their horses.\nThis time, no one paid any attention to\ntheir fallen comrades. The Teada Red\nGuard accelerated, and after two volleys\nof arrows from the white armored\nsoldiers, the distance of over a 100 m\nwas reduced to only 50 m. The first row\nof white armored soldiers stood\nmotionless with their long spears while\nthe white armored soldiers behind them\nquickly slung their long bows behind\ntheir backs, pulled out steel javelins,\nshort spears, from their waists and\nraised them high to gather strength. Put\ndrink. 80 javelins flew out and pierced\nheavily into the ranks of Teada's red\nguard cavalry. Each of the white armored\nBayer picked up a steel rod again. Put\ndrink. The Teada red guards were less\nthan 10 m away from the white armored\nsoldiers. Short ax drink. Whirlwindlike\naxes flew out from the ranks of the\nwhite armored soldiers, felling the\nentire front line of Teada's red guard.\nBoom. The few remaining red guard\ncavalry finally clashed with the first\nrank of white armored Bayer. Half of the\nwhite armored soldiers in the first row\nwere knocked down, but the other half\nwithtood the impact, being battered by\nseveral waves of arrows, javelins, and\nfinally a wave of short axes. Only 20 or\n30 riders from the Teada Red Guards\nmanaged to reach the White Armor Army's\nformation. Kill Agnes s command. The\nwhite armored soldiers broke formation\nand grabbed their most familiar weapons.\nCharging forward fiercely to entangle\nthe teada red guards who had just gotten\nup from the ground. Chapter 184.\nAnnihilation of the red guards. The war\nof attack begins. Almost everyone in the\nlive stream was stunned. No one spoke.\nThey all stared intently at the live\nstream screen. It was as if the battle\nbetween Lin Xiao's powerful troops and\nthe Black Flame Legion was being\nreplayed. This time the white armor\nsoldiers seemed to be replicating the\nmiracle of that time. The mighty Teada\nRed Guard, one of the strongest military\nunits in Japan, heavily armored knights\nwho could stand shoulder-to-shoulder\nwith the three major nightly orders of\nEurope, were wiped out before they could\neven reach the white armored soldiers\nwith a single charge, with seven or\neight out of 10 of them being taken\ndown. The endless barrage of attacks by\nthe white armored soldiers in particular\ngave everyone a tremendous shock. When\nthey first appeared, some people laughed\nat them for carrying so many weapons\nlike they were selling groceries. But\nnow they can't laugh anymore. The white\narmored soldiers are terrifying. Baka,\ndo you think your bunch of ragtag\nsoldiers can defeat the Teada Red Guards\nso easily? Toy Jinichiro roared. Let\nthem see the might of the Red Guard. Red\nguards who were shot down suffered minor\ninjuries while a few were seriously\nwounded. When they saw the white armored\nsoldiers coming towards them, they\nquickly got up, either unfassening their\nJapanese swords or picking up their\nspears, ready to fight. Our teada red\ncavalry is not only heavy cavalry\ncapable of charging into enemy lines,\nbut also consists of top tier warriors\nwho can fight even after falling from\ntheir horses. Toy Jenny Chiro shouted.\nThinking you can defeat me by knocking\nme off my horse? You're too naive. Come,\nlet's have a glorious duel of warriors.\nA red guard soldier wielding a Japanese\nsword shouted. He was met with several\narrows, a steel chisel, and a short axe.\nThe soldier quickly dodged, but an arrow\nstill struck him through a gap in his\nknee armor, causing him to writhe on the\nground in pain. A knotted rope fell from\nthe sky, strangled his neck, and dragged\nhim out. The Red Guard soldier hurriedly\ndrew his short knife, intending to cut\nthe ropes. At that moment, a long spear\npierced straight into his exposed lower\nneck, killing the Red Guard soldier\ninstantly. This is shameless. Outnumber\nthem. Besides, what kind of weapon is a\nrope? Toy Jenny launched into a tirade\nof curses. You lack the spirit of\nBushidto. Across from him, Lyn Shao\nseemed to ignore him, simply nodding in\nsatisfaction. To deal with wild beasts,\nyou need hunters. The strongest\nfishermen and hunters between the black\nwaters and the white mountains, the top\nhunters are perfect for killing the wild\nbeasts of Japan. On the battlefield, the\nwhite armored Bayer and the red armored\ntroops, one white and one red, formed a\nstriking contrast, allowing everyone\nwatching the god systems live broadcast\nto clearly see the battle. Faced with\nthe pursuit of several red guard\nwarriors, a white armored Bayer did not\nhesitate at all and ran away. He was\nclad in heavy armor, but ran extremely\nfast. The red guards couldn't keep up\nwith him. Just as the red guard was\nabout to change targets and annihilate\nthe others, the white armored Bayer\nturned around, drew his giant bow, and\nfired an arrow. The armor-piercing arrow\npierced the flesh, severely damaging the\nred guard warrior, who had to stop and\nrest as the remaining red armed warriors\ncontinued their pursuit. The white armed\nwarrior assumed a dual stance, but\nsuddenly unleashed two javelins in quick\nsuccession. The red clad samurai were\nelite warriors who parried the javelin\nat close range. But what they didn't\nexpect was that following one of the\njavelins was a spinning throwing axe.\nThe flying axe cleaved the face of one\nof the red guard warriors, shattering\nhis demon mask and penetrating three\ntints of the bone, splattering blood all\nover his face. Immediately afterwards,\nanother arrow pierced the right eye of\nthe red guard samurai. This samurai,\njust like his unit name, was as red as\ncould be. Extremely red. Wow. In the\nlive stream, everyone was amazed. Such\nscenes keep appearing everywhere. These\nwhite armored warriors, after unhorsing\nthe heavy cavalry of Teada's Red Guard,\nengaged in a fierce close quarters\nbattle. Only then did everyone realize\nthe white armored soldiers possess\nextremely powerful combat abilities and\nthey are unruly, ruthless, and vicious.\nAs long as they have a numerical\nadvantage, they will not hesitate to\nfight outnumbered. But if they fall into\na disadvantageous position, they will\nrun away immediately. The Teada Red\nGuards, heavily armored, couldn't catch\nup at all. But once they stop chasing,\nthese fierce white armored soldiers will\nturn around and brutally attack the\nTeada Red Guard's rear end. In a\none-on-one fight, the Teada Red Guards\nwith their outstanding individual combat\ncapabilities were no match for the white\narmored soldiers. Long distance. The\nwhite armored soldiers can use bows and\narrows. Although they cannot shoot as\nfar as the archers of the sun never\nsets, their angles are tricky and their\narchery skills are excellent. Mid-range,\nthe white armored soldiers would throw\njavelins, which were powerful, heavy,\nand had strong penetrating force,\nmedium, and short distances. Before\nengaging in close combat, the white\narmored soldiers throw short axes, which\nare extremely effective at piercing\narmor and causing great damage. Close\nquarters combat. They are extremely\nskilled with both spears and short\nswords, and can switch freely between\nunconventional weapons such as ropes and\nsickles. member of the Teada Red Guard\nseized an opportunity to get close and\nlaunch a fierce attack only to find that\nthese white armored soldiers also have\narmor underneath their white iron armor\nmaking their defensive capabilities\ntruly astonishing. They cleaved through\nthe outermost layer of rolled iron\narmor, revealing chain mail underneath.\nBreak through the chain mail and you'll\nfind studded cotton armor underneath.\nSorry. Even though the cotton armor was\nbroken, the white armored Bayer was in\ndead. During this time, he had already\nkilled at least two or three red guard\nwarriors. Thus, the advantage on the\nbattlefield was established the moment\nthe Teada Red Guard fell from their\nhorses. The white armored Bayer,\noutnumbered and outgunned, fought while\nrunning, besieging the enemy and\nattacking reinforcements, quickly and\nfiercely defeating the Red Guard\nwarriors so badly they couldn't even\nlift their heads. Baka Baka. Under the\nimpotent rage of Toyotomy Jinichiro, the\nlast Teada Red Guard samurai was pierced\nto death by a spear. Battle over. All of\nToyottomy Jinikairo&lt;unk&gt;'s units have\nbeen eliminated, resulting in a loss for\nthe Japanese player. The indifferent\nvoice of the Supreme God rang out,\nfollowed by a flash of white light, and\nboth sides were teleported back to the\nrest area. \"Well done, Chu Yusi was the\nfirst to step forward and congratulate\nLin Sha. I have merely fulfilled my\nmission,\" Lyn Shao said modestly. \"The\nelimination rounds are over, and the\nnext match is the arena battle.\nEveryone, take a break. Boss Lynn Shiao,\nyou're amazing. Heay excitedly stepped\nforward to congratulate him. No wonder\nall my flower fairies like you so much.\nUpon hearing the word flower fairy, Lyn\nShia gave Heay a strange look. That\nexpression seemed to say, \"If you give\nthe flower fairy such a weird reward\nagain, you'd better watch out for my\nbeating.\" Heay chuckled sheepishly and\nscratched his head sheepishly. Boss,\ncould you then fulfill your promise to\nthe flower fairy? No. Get out. Tu Shan\nby Chin, Ding Lay, and the others rushed\nover. Tu Shan by Chin jumped up and\nclung to Lyn Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s arm like a\nkoala, her feet gripping Lin Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s,\nher fluffy cat ears swaying back and\nforth on Lin Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s face. Brother\nLynsha, you're amazing. I want to have\nyour babies. Lyn Shiao ripped off the\ncute little girl in white stockings\nagain and chuckled expressionlessly.\nfigure who was walking over was stunned\nfor a moment when she heard Tu Shawn by\nChin's words and then shook her head\nwith a smile. Lynn Shiao,\ncongratulations. Also, your team has a\nreally good atmosphere. Thank you, class\nmonitor. Do you have time? I'd like to\ntalk to you about something privately.\nTu Shan by Chen and Heay immediately\nexchanged a glance, their expressions\nplayful. Please. Seeing Lin Shiao and\nDugu Jaon walk to the quiet area of the\nrest area, Hay couldn't help but nudge\nto Shaun Bian. Hey, do you think she has\na thing for the boss? It's interesting.\nThat's great. They're a good match. Tan\nby Chian casually replied, \"Aren't you\njealous?\" H I'd be content to be Lin\nXiao's concubine. What's there to be\njealous about? TCH, no ambition. He\ncurled his lip. A few minutes later, the\ntwo returned looking perfectly normal.\nsystem sounded again. The arena battle\nbegins. All 10 victorious lords from the\ndragon sia kingdom have made their\nappearance, dividing into 10\nbattlefields to confront the 10 lords\nfrom the eastern Japan. The winner will\ncontinue to fight against the winner of\nthe other side until all units of one\nside are defeated. Lyn Shao makes\nanother appearance. Chapter 185. of the\ncountermeasures against Japan. The\narchers of Tatami Baka Yamamoto\nIsuroka's face turned ashen to lose so\ncompletely. The entire Teada Red Guard\nwas wiped out, managing to kill only\nseven of the enemy. Toyottomy Jinny\nChiro, you have disappointed me greatly.\nThe enemy's unit types are too strange\nand I I have no experience. Toyottomy\nJiniurro replied in a flustered manner.\nSnort. Don't make excuses. A loss is a\nloss. Yes. Jinichiro Toyota lowered his\nhead deeply. Yamamoto Isuroku brandished\nhis katana. No need to think about it.\nThis white armored Bayer must also be a\nlegendary gold tier unit. This also\naligns with our worst case scenario. But\nwe still have 30 lords while they only\nhave 10. Everyone, the arena battles\nwill begin soon, and you may all\nencounter Lin Shiao. What good methods\ndo you all have to deal with Lin\nXiao&lt;unk&gt;s white armored soldiers?\nRemote. Sakura Shichiro glanced smuggly\nat Toyotomy Jinichiro and spoke first. I\nobserved that the white armored soldiers\nfiring range is less than 200 m. We can\nuse longrange attacks to wear them down.\nWith my skill buffs, my archers from the\ndistant river have a range exceeding 300\nm. I can wear them down with archers.\nYamamoto\nnodded. You'll be the first to go and\ndeal with Lin Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s white armored\nsoldiers. First one up? Sakura Shichiro\nasked in surprise. My lord, I am not\nlike some people who can eliminate Lin\nShiao all by myself. Isn't it just\nfighting and running? Do you think the\narchers of Tatami can't outrun heavily\narmored soldiers? Baka Yamamoto Isuroku\nglared at him and Sakura Shichiro\nimmediately fell silent, arrogant and\ncomplacent, looking down on everyone. If\nyou can wipe out Lin Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s troops,\nI'll give you the top credit. But if you\nlose, we need a backup plan. Yes. What\nother ways do you all have to deal with\nLyn Xiao's white armored soldiers?\nmagic, shadow warrior, the heavily\narmored pheasant blade cavalry can\nfight. Cavalry arcoers and me, the\nTokugawa crossbow. Seeing the high\nmorale of the participating lords,\nYamamoto Isuroku nodded in satisfaction.\nHe can wear Lin Sha down. In the live\nstream room opened by the god system,\nhundreds of millions of viewers are\nwatching. Although Lin Sha won, can\nLonga win the upcoming gauntlet match?\n10 against 30? I doubt it. With a flash\nof light, Lyn Shao stepped into the\nbattlefield once more. On the far\nopposite side was a handsome young man,\nbut he was gritting his teeth. Lyn\nShiao, you are destined to lose today.\nSo, it's Sakura Shichiro. What? You were\nviolated in prison and you hate me so\nmuch. Lyn Shao said calmly. Shameless,\nvulgar, and disgusting. Sakura Shichiro\ns face twisted in disgust. Everything I\nhave is thanks to you. bear my wrath.\nWhat do you mean? Thanks to me. What a\njoke. Lynn Sha interrupted Ingiro\ncalmly, picking his ear and saying, \"If\nyou hadn't killed your own kind, none of\nthis would have happened, would it?\" As\nexpected, you Japanese are encouraable.\nYou can only see others and not your own\nproblems. That's what they call a\nleopard can't change its spots. You\nSakura Shichiro was furious. Archers\nfrom the distant river charge. 100 fully\nequipped archers from the distant river\nimmediately formed a formation and\nslowly advanced. They carried long\nswords on their backs and held long bows\nin their hands. This attire indicated\nthat they were capable of both ranged\nand melee combat, making them rare and\nversatile archers. On this side, 93\nwhite armored beer watched indifferently\nas the enemy walked towards them and the\nleader Actton suddenly smiled\ndisdainfully. The strangely pronounced\nvoice rang out again and by Jaayala\nwalked towards the enemy formation.\nGreat, they want to have a duel. How\ncould the white armored soldiers\npossibly be a match for mytomy archers?\nSakura Shichiro&lt;unk&gt;'s eyes suddenly lit\nup. Preparation. The archers from Yuan\nJang stopped 400 meters away. All of\nthem drew their bows, aimed, and\nprepared to fire. The archers had\nexcellent eyesight. They watched\nsilently as the white armored soldiers\napproached in a scattered and\ndisorganized manner. Seeing the\nindifferent expressions on their faces\nand the way they looked at them like\nthey were dead, they couldn't help but\nshudder. Concentrate. The captain\ncouldn't help but remind them. and the\narchers of the far river archery team\nfinally stabilized their formation. Put\nout a command 100 arrows flew into the\nsky and then the arrows rained down.\nArchers of Tatami are skilled at\nshooting arrows into the sky and then\nusing inertia and gravity to pierce the\nenemy's armor. They used this tactic to\ndefeat countless heavily armored\nlegions. The arrow was still in the air\nwhen the white armored Bayer suddenly\naccelerated and ran wildly. The already\nsparse formation scattered even further.\nArrows that take two seconds to travel\nto the ground are easily dodged by the\nwhite armored soldiers. I see the\nviewers in the live stream realized the\nreign of arrows from 100 archers isn't\ndense enough. It's too difficult to\ncover the entire battlefield. Skilled\nsoldiers like the white armored soldiers\ncan dodge arrows by observing their\ntrajectory. Damn it. Sakura Shichiro\nshouted. Keep firing. Concentrate your\nfirepower and take out a few of them\nfirst. Archers from the distant river\ndrew their bows again, and the charging\nwhite armored Bayer was already only 200\nm away from them. Put the arrows flew\ninto the sky again, this time aimed at\nthe dozen or so white armored soldiers\nrunning at the forefront. 100 arrows\nwere evenly distributed, covering the\nwhite armored soldiers advance and\nevasion routes, leaving them with no way\nto avoid them. Suddenly, the dozen or so\nwhite armored soldiers running ahead\nstopped abruptly, turned around, and\nnimly rolled backward like rabbits. They\nactually ran backwards. Most of the\narrows missed their mark. Only a few\narrows anticipated the white armored\nsoldiers trajectory, but the rolling\nwhite armored soldiers absorbed most of\ntheir force, and only three white\narmored soldiers were injured. Baka,\nkeep the fire going. But at this moment,\nthe white armored soldiers had already\nreached a distance of less than 200\nmeters from the archers of Yuan Jang.\nActton smiled sinisterly. Kill. The\nwhite armored soldier drew his long bow\nand fired an arrow as he ran. Move and\nfire. The arrow followed a slight\nparabolic arc and without ascending into\nthe air and landing, swiftly pierced the\nranks of the archers in the distant\nriver region. More than a dozen archers\nfrom the distant river fell to the\nground. What? The archers from the far\nriver region were shot down by the white\narmored Bayer. Is this still their ace\narcher or is it that by Jabayala is the\nreal Trump card? The viewers in the live\nstream were shocked and buzzed with\ndiscussion. Meanwhile, Sakura Shichiro\nwas also jumping up and down in anger.\nStop launching projectiles. Just shoot\nthem directly. The two sides were now\nmore than 100 m apart. At this distance,\nwith the strength of the elite archers\non both sides, there was no need for\nthem to launch their arrows. They could\nsimply raise their hands and fire at\neach other. The white armored Baya wore\nthree layers of armor, and the archers\nfrom the distant river also wore thick\narmor. Both sides carried hard bows. The\narchers duel has begun. Archer from the\ndistant river, suppressing his anger,\nswitched to armor-piercing heavy arrows\nand drew his bowring at the approaching\nwhite armored soldier. Arrows flew\nswiftly towards them. Suddenly, the\nwhite armored Bayer, who was advancing,\nlunged to the ground. His three layers\nof armor tumbled with his massive body,\ndodging the arrows. From the Yuan Jang\narchers, was about to rain down. The\nwhite armored Bayer retaliated with a\nvolley of arrows while rolling around.\nAnother group of archers from the\ndistant river fell. The archers from the\ndistant river immediately retaliated\nwith a horizontal shot. Before everyone\ncould see clearly, Baija Beayala rolled\nforward again, using the roll to dodge\nand reduce the damage from the enemy's\narrows. At the same time, he drew his\nbow and knocked an arrow while rolling\nand immediately shot the arrow forward\nafter one roll. Archers from the distant\nriver could hardly hit the white armored\nBayer. Even if they did hit him, most of\nthe force was absorbed by the rolling\narmor by Jiaala s arrows are fast and\naccurate, flying from tricky angles and\nable to shoot down the archers of Yuan\nJang. After several rolls, the white\narmored Baya had already killed more\nthan half of the Yuan Jang archers.\nChapter 186. The situation is dire,\nboosting morale. Baka shameless Sakura\nShichiro s stomping foot echoed through\nthe waiting area of Japan. Toyottomy\nJinichiro who had been keeping his head\ndown and remaining silent suddenly felt\ninexplicably cheerful. As a young genius\nof this generation, he has always been\ninvincible. Their own troops were\nutterly defeated by the unknown white\narmor soldiers and looked down upon by\nothers. Now Sakura Shikaru is\nexperiencing this feeling too on the\nbattlefield. Soon the archers from the\ndistant river could not hold out any\nlonger and the remaining dozen or so\narchers hurriedly sought cover to avoid\nthe increasing number of arrows from the\nwhite armored soldiers. There's one last\nmove, Sakura Shichiro thought to\nhimself, clenching his fist. There are\ndozens of lightly wounded archers from\nthe distant river region who have been\nhit by arrows and more than a dozen who\nare still in good condition and capable\nof fighting. Once the white armored\nsoldiers charge over, the archers from\nthe distant river can pick up their long\nswords and rush in to kill them. Huh?\nSakura Shichiro could finish speaking.\nThe white armored Bayer had already\nrushed in front of the Tatami archers.\nAn archer from the distant river drew\nhis long sword only to be met with a 4 m\nlong spear that mercilessly pierced his\nbody. \"You! How can you use such a long\nweapon?\" La o opposite him sneered, drew\nhis weapon, ignored the yuan jang\narchers, and immediately went to find\nthe next victim. Elsewhere, the white\narmored Bayer soldiers who rushed up\nemployed various methods: steel bars,\njavelins, throwing axes, spears, swords,\nand ropes. The one-sided brutal defeat\nof the Teada Red Guards that had just\noccurred was repeated. Tatammy archers\ntouted as capable of both ranged and\nmelee combat are ultimately only good\nfor secondary support roles in close\ncombat, even inferior to the Teada Red\nGuards. They're only decent against\nordinary melee units among the elite or\nepic unit types. To attack someone like\nthat is simply courting death. No, my\narchers of toty in a tag team battle.\nThe fighting must continue until all of\none side's units are wiped out. Sakura\nShichiro could only watch helplessly as\nhis legendary units were mercilessly\nkilled one by one. The battle ended\nquickly and the two were teleported out\nof the battlefield. Lyn Sha took stock\nof the surviving white armor Bayera and\nfound that apart from five people who\nwere shot down by arrows and seriously\ninjured and seven or eight others who\nwere slightly injured, there were almost\nno losses. still 88 white armored Bayer\nwho can play. As for the five seriously\ninjured, Lynn Shia released them back\ninto his territory to heal at their own\npace. Upon arriving at the rest area,\nChu Yui and the other contestants\nbriefly congratulated Lin Shiao before\nreturning to watch the match with somber\nexpressions. Lyn Shia understood the\nreason. Although we won, the Dragon Sea\nKingdom is still at a disadvantage\noverall. The duel is just an appetizer\nin the martial arts arena. Even if you\nlose, it won't affect the overall\nsituation too much. Lin Daoing came to\nLyn Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s side, his eyes also fixed\non the screen, and said, \"I'm sorry. I\ncouldn't win against the heavy armored\npheasant cavalry. I only managed to\nexchange all of my dream demons for 20\nknights.\" Lyn Sha smiled faintly. Thank\nyou. In that kind of flat terrain, it is\nindeed difficult for dream demons to use\ntheir abilities. The two continued to\nobserve the changes on the battlefield\nin silence. As battle after battle\nended, all of Lia's players soon\nreturned. Apart from Lin Shao, only\nChufinga, Dinglay, and Shunandu won.\nThis means that six people from the\nJapanese side won. Next, four people\nwill fight against 26 people. Everyone's\nexpression turned very serious. Even\namong the viewers in the live stream,\nvery few were happy. Currently, only Lin\nXiao's strength remains intact. Some\nanalysts have suggested that Lin Shiao\nstill has nearly 90 people. Dinglays\nNaga Queen has over 50 left. Chufinga's\nspotted leopard berserkers only have 23\nleft, and Shinuandu's diamond golems\nonly have 30 left. The scariest thing is\nthat we can analyze that Linhao's unit\nmust be a gold legendary, but the other\nthree's units are only epic. There are\nalso four legendary unit types and more\nthan 10 epic unit types in Japan. How\ncan we possibly win like this? Lia might\nlose the next match. An atmosphere of\nanxiety began to spread and someone\nasked Gene Wooang a question. Old Devil,\nwhat do you think? I believe it is too\nearly to draw conclusions, Jin Wuang\nsaid calmly. I advise you not to be too\npessimistic. What that person said\nearlier was not correct. You mean Liao\nwill win? No, I mean Liao won't lose so\nquickly. Lyn Shia can at least last a\nfew more games. TCH. Even Lin Shiao\nalone couldn't defeat Japan's nearly\n2,000 troops with only 80 or 90\ndifferent types of soldiers. In the end,\nLonga still lost. While the losers were\narguing in the live stream and pondering\ntheir next move with serious\nexpressions, Lin Sha, who was watching\nthe argument, smiled. The group who were\nfeeling down were somewhat puzzled. They\nonly saw that there were still 26 lords\nin Japan, but they didn't see the\nefforts you all just made. Lynn Shiao\nslowly walked up to the crowd and said\nloudly, \"Although we lost six men, Lynn\nDouching decimated 20 heavily armored\npheasant sword cavalry. The head hunters\nof Julie crippled the Tokugawa\ncrossbowmen on the opposite side and\nWong Bo figured out the patterns of the\ncavalry arquable, exposed their tactics,\nand seriously wounded more than a dozen\nof them. These are Japan's elite troops,\nthe legendary golden units. Their\nweakening can play a crucial role in the\nbattle. Therefore, your contributions\nare truly remarkable. Leave the rest to\nme. As Lyn Sha finished speaking, the\nLord's gloomy mood improved somewhat,\nand the eyes of those lords who were\nblaming themselves seemed to light up\nagain. A flash of light and Lyn Sha was\nteleported to the battlefield. \"I feel\nmuch better.\" The athletes in the rest\narea murmured to themselves. I think Lin\nShiao is a pretty easy person to get\nalong with. Julie whispered. I'm\nconvinced that he's the team leader.\nWong B said with a hearty laugh. Haha.\nNot bad. Not bad. The more I look at\nthis kid, the more I like him. Chu Yui,\nwho had remained silent to avoid putting\npressure on the other contestants,\nnodded in satisfaction, fearless in the\nface of danger, strong under pressure,\nand able to inspire others. Lynn Shiao\nis a man of his word. I have faith in\nhim. The lord of the domain made the\nright choice in appointing him as the\ndeputy city lord. Sigh. If only I had a\ndaughter. Haha. The lords were overjoyed\nand even the usually aloof Dugu Jaolon\nhad a slight smile on his lips. Chufinga\nglanced at Chu Yusi with a mournful\nlook. But before she could speak, she\nwas also teleported to the battlefield\nby the god system. For battlefields have\nbeen reopened and the battle has begun.\nIn the first desert terrain, Chufinga's\n30 odd epic spotted leopard berserkers\nfaced off against 70 epic level combat\nninjas from the east. The second\nbattlefield is a swampy terrain where\nDing lays 50 odd Naga queens face off\nagainst the epic unit from the east, the\nTokugawa crossbow. The third battlefield\nis the arena where Chun Schwandu's\ndiamond puppets fight against one of\nJapan's ace teams, a full strength\nshadow warrior commando squad. The\nfourth battlefield is a relatively wide\nplane. Lynn Xiao's 88 white armored\nBayer soldiers face off against the\nJapanese ACE unit, a legendary gold tier\nunit. 80 heavily armored pheasant blade\ncavalry. Chapter 1. 87 Tokugawa Hayabusa\nheavy armored pheasant blade cavalry.\nBattle begins. Hundreds of millions of\npeople in the Lsha Kingdom were all\nglued to the live broadcast. Although it\nwas just the prelude to the National\nFortune Arena and the first part of the\nheroic martial arts arena, the\nexcitement of this series of battles was\nalready captivating. Moreover, due to\nthe long-standing feud with Japan, the\npeople of Lung Sha also hoped that their\nlords could win on the battlefield and\nprove themselves. Lyn Sha appeared on\nthe live stream, attracting the most\nattention. At this moment, the 88 white\narmored bars reappeared, still as\nindifferent and fierce as ever. Their\nstrange faces and dark skin weathered by\ntime made them look like the most\nferocious beasts in the wilderness.\nAcross from him, Tokugawa Hayato, the\nlord of Japan, solemnly bowed to Lin Sha\nin respect. Lin Shiao Jun, I am Tokugawa\nHayyato, one of the top five lords of\nJapan in this generation. I have been\npracticing for two and a half years\nsince I entered the battlefield of all\nraces. In this battle, I will give it my\nall. I've heard that Lin Shiao Jun is a\nnew generation genius of the Dragon Sea\nKingdom and the Deputy City Lord of\nDragon South City. It would be an honor\nfor me, Tokugawa Hayabusa, to have the\nopportunity to duel with Lin Shiao Jun.\nPlease give me your guidance. Hi, with a\nhint of surprise, then nodded slightly.\nI won't hold back. It is not the fault\nof a virtuous person to be born in a\ncountry of petty people. Tokugawa Hiyato\nmoved with lightning speed. His heavily\narmored pheasant sword cavalry quickly\nassembled and without any further ado\nlaunched a legionary charge. Heavily\narmored pheasant cavalry are like a\nlowprofile version of the Mod Dao iron\nguards on horseback. Each of them\ncarries a long-handled broadsword which\nis extremely sharp. They wear heavy\narmor and their horses are also heavily\narmored. They are characterized by their\ncourage and strength and can be\nconsidered another ace heavy cavalry\nunit similar in role to the teada red\nguards. The difference is that the\nheavily armored pheasant cavalry focuses\nmore on stacking defense and attack like\na running tin can. Moreover, the heavy\narmored pheasant cavalry has only been\naround for a few years, so its\nreputation is not as great as that of\nthe teada red guard. The thunderous\nsound of hoves rang out as the heavily\narmored cavalry began their charge. It's\nover this time. The heavily armored\npheasant cavalry's defense is even\nstronger than the Teada Red Guard. I'm\nafraid the white armored Bayer do have\nmany ways to deal with them. Yes, most\nimportantly, this time the terrain is\nflat with no terrain obstacles, which is\na great advantage for the cavalry. Even\nif these white armored Bayer used long\nbows and heavy arrows, the cavalry would\nbe at their faces in one or two shots at\nmost. The sheer force of the heavily\narmored pheasant sword cavalry is\nprobably no less than that of the\nTutonic Knights in Europe. Can the white\narmored Bayer in the front ranks\nwithstand their charge with their\ninfantry lances? Before the two sides\neven clashed, the viewers in the live\nstream were already starting to worry.\nOn the Japanese side, Yamamoto Isuroku\nalso nodded in satisfaction. Of the four\nbattles, only Lin Xiao's side had a\nterrain advantage that was completely\nfavorable to his side. Tokugawa Hayyato\nis also a rare genius. He seized the\nopportunity and immediately organized a\ncavalry charge. This time, Lynn Shiao\nshould have no way to resist. In the\nDragon Summer Rest area, all the lords\nstared intently at the four battles that\nwere taking place simultaneously. Lyn\nXiao's battle map was the most\nstraightforward and both sides engaged\nin the fight with minimal talk and\npreparation with most people watching\nLyn Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s battle. However, Lord\nLong Lia felt mostly regret. Lyn Sha,\nyou must keep it up. Lyn Shao, this time\nit's a bit risky. If we lose, we lose.\nThere are still the general and Lord\nbattles. We can win them back. Sigh.\nIt's all my fault. I didn't use more\nheavy pheasant cavalry. Lyn Shiao, I'll\napologize to you when you come out.\nHeavily armored pheasant cavalry charged\ntoward Lin Xiao's position with\nthunderous hooves. The impact is\npalpable even through the screen. Just\nwhen everyone thought the white armored\nsoldiers were doomed. Suddenly, Actton\nwhistled. All the white armored soldiers\nwhistled in unison just like Actton. 88\nhorses came running out. The white\narmored soldier mounted his horse and\nrode away. Everyone was stunned. That's\nright. When the white armored Bayer\nfirst appeared, they were cavalry.\nHowever, in these battles, the white\narmored soldiers formidable infantry\ncombat capabilities caused everyone to\noverlook this point. Now they've\nrecalled the horses. Could it be? Facing\nthe charging heavy pheasant cavalry, Bja\nBayala did not hesitate at all. Turned\naround on his horse and fled. The\nbattlefield was a flat plane, neither\ntoo big nor too small, but large enough\nfor two cavalry units to maneuver\nfreely. Everyone was astonished by\nJiaala had summoned his horse so he\ncould escape. The heavily armored\npheasant cavalry gave chase while the\nwhite armored Bayer charged ahead.\nGradually, everyone realized a problem.\nThe heavily armored pheasant cavalry\ncouldn't catch up with the white armored\nBayer. The white- armored bay seem to be\nnot as tall, but they have better\nendurance. Moreover, the white armored\nhorses do not wear such thick armor, so\nthey can carry a lighter load. Just when\nthe heavily armored pheasant cavalry\nrealized that they were being chased\naround in circles by the white armored\nBayer on the battlefield and could not\nbe caught up, the white armored soldiers\nmaintained their distance, mounted their\nhorses, drew their long bows, and\nunleashed a volley of arrows. Mounted\narchers, someone exclaimed. These white\narmored soldiers have so many attack\nmethods. They can even be mounted\narchers. Arrows rained down, striking\nthe heavily armored cavalry s formation.\nDespite their heavy armor, the white\narmored soldiers accurate archery caused\nseveral heavily armored cavalrymen to be\nshot in the eyes and faces or their\nhorses falling off their mouths. Damn\nit, chase after them. The heavily\narmored pheasant wielding cavalry gave\nchase while the white armored Bayer\naccelerated once more. When the heavily\narmored pheasant sword cavalry got\ntired, the white armored Bayer once\nagain controlled the distance and\nunleashed another volley of arrows,\nfelling several knights. This tactic,\nthough shameless, is undeniably\neffective. A viewer in the live stream\nsaid, \"The white- armored Bayer are\ntruly a military force that has no\nmarshall ethics, no methods, and only\ncares about victory. They may flee at\nany time, but they will come back at any\ntime.\" It's really amazing, doesn't\ntheir repeated desertions affect morale\nand military discipline? You have to\nunderstand that on the battlefield,\nevery soldier's every move is magnified\ninfinitely. If a soldier turns to run\naway, how do you know if he is luring\nthe enemy or if he is really running\naway? One person lures the enemy while\nthe rest actually run. If even one\nperson escapes, it will trigger a chain\nreaction potentially leading to the\ncomplete defeat of the army. Therefore,\nmilitary discipline is paramount. Anyone\nwho runs away will be killed. But the\nwhite armored Bayera could ignore this\nrule. Individuals, scattered groups, and\ncollectives could all run away. But\neveryone, including the commander,\nbelieved they would come back to\ncontinue fighting. Everyone marveled as\nthey watched by Ja Bayer use an\nunsolvable method to continuously kite\ndown all the heavily armored pheasant\nblade cavalry. Then the white armored\nsoldiers dismounted and became infantry,\ncautiously and ruthlessly, reaping the\nlives of all the wounded and fallen\nriders. Battle damage zero. Hi facing\nhim gritted his teeth but there was\nnothing he could do. After all the\nheavily armored cavalrymen had perished,\nTokugawa Hiayato took a deep breath and\nbowed to Lin Shiao saying, \"Thanks for\nthe advice. I've lost. I've also\nidentified the weaknesses of the heavy\npheasant cavalry. We will work on\naddressing those weaknesses in the\nfuture.\" Lyn Shia nodded slightly. He\nhad a somewhat favorable impression of\nthis upright and polite Japanese man.\nYou'll soon realize that you didn't lose\nunjustly. Chapter 1 1881 against 21.\nLet's go. With a flash of light, Lyn\nShiao returned to the rest area. Because\nLyn Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s kite-flying tactic took a\nlong time, the other three participating\nlords had already returned before him.\nChunwandu's diamond puppet was no match\nfor the shadow warrior assault team and\nhas been defeated. Chufinga's leopard\nberserkers were lucky. The desert\nterrain gave them a significant\nadvantage. And with Chufinga fighting\nwith his back against the wall, he\ndefeated the battle ninja, who were also\nepic level units. But the panther\nberserkers only have less than 10 men\nleft, and they are destined to lose the\nnext match. However, the kid had\ncompleted his task and was happily\npacing around in front of his father,\nhis red hair extremely flamboyant, which\nmade everyone grimace. Dingle performed\nwell. His battlefield was a swampy area\nwhich provided a significant advantage\nagainst the halfhuman half-snake Naga\nrace. At the start of the battle, the\nNaga queen infiltrated the swamp and\napproached the Tokugawa crossbowmen,\ndefeating this ranged unit in close\ncombat with only about 10 casualties of\nher own. Lynsha nodded. This was the\nreason why he didn't bring a single type\nof soldier with combat capabilities. It\nwas too easy for them to be targeted.\nWhen the battlefield environment\nchanges, advantages and disadvantages\nwill be magnified infinitely. Next, we\nhave three more lords, Chu Yusi\nconcluded. There are still 23 lords on\nthe other side. We all have heavy\nresponsibilities, so let's not let our\nguard down. Lord, you could say we only\nhave two lords on our side. Anyway,\nShufinga won't be able to gloat for much\nlonger. Can't you let that redhead be\nhappy for a little while longer? Haha.\nThanks to Lyn Xiao's encouragement,\neveryone gradually accepted the current\nsituation and the atmosphere wasn't so\nheavy. In the Japanese rest area,\nYamamoto Isuroku and a group of lords\ngathered together for a discussion. Two\nlegendary cavalry units and the shadow\nwarrior assault team. Yamamoto Isuroku\nsaid, \"And that guy, Lynn Shia, still\nhas 88 white armor soldiers. The rest\nare no threat, but this guy is the most\nhateful, so I've decided to treat him\nwith care. You two don't engage Lynn\nShiao in battle yet. All epic units\nstepped forward. The rest periods during\nthe tag team battle were very short and\nsoon the battle resumed. The three were\nteleported to the battlefield. This time\nChufunga encountered a powerful cavalry\nand arrobe team and the spotted leopard\nberserker was instantly annihilated. The\nred-haired boy returned to the rest area\ndejectedly. Dingle encountered one of\nthe epic Japanese unit types, the shogun\nat spearman. Relying on his ability to\nbecome stronger by showing off, Dinglay\nmade boastful remarks on the\nbattlefield, startling the opposing\nteam. Then his Naga Queen attribute was\nenhanced, allowing him to charge in and\nslaughter his opponents to victory. Lyn\nShao encountered a group of ninjas.\nThere are many different schools of\nninja in Japan. Upon seeing the ninjas,\nLynsha immediately warned Actton to be\ncareful. The white armored ninjas\ncautiously approached and after killing\nseveral ninjas, they began to\naccelerate. Suddenly, the ninjas who\nwere at close range through smoke bombs,\ngunpowder, and poison darts, instantly\ntaking down two white armored Bayer in\nthe smoke. The white armored soldiers\nwere on guard and resisted. But the\nninjas, seeing that their plan had been\nexposed, rushed forward fearlessly to\nchase after the white armored soldiers.\nIt turns out that the Japanese wanted to\nplay a war of attrition, use a suicide\nattack by special forces to exhaust Lin\nXiao's white armor barera. The white\narmored soldiers turned tail and ran\nagain. The white armored soldiers in the\nfront ranks fired arrows and used spears\nto block using their three layers of\narmor to defend against the suicidal\nninjas. The white armored soldiers in\nthe back row had already untied the hemp\nropes. They combined the hemp ropes,\nshort axes, steel chisels, sickles, and\nother tools into different props, used\nthe terrain to set up traps, and then\nuse these props to directly create all\nsorts of bizarre weapons. Before long,\nthe front row white armored soldiers\nretreated and joined the rest of the\nwhite armored soldiers. The white\narmored soldiers gathered together,\nrelying on the terrain and traps. Ahead\nlay traps, mechanisms, and roadblocks\nset up by the white armored soldiers. In\nthe middle is a white armored warrior\nwielding a long spear and a sword.\nBehind them was a group of white armored\nBayer holding long bows and firing\narrows. Now, the ninjas who were eager\nto learn from the kamicazi special\nforces were unable to continue their\nadvance. Even if they used smoke bombs,\nthey would be blocked by traps and then\nkilled by the white armored soldiers.\nAfter a period of stalemate, the\nimpatient ninjas launched a collective\ncharge, taking down two more white\narmored Bajaras before being wiped out,\nending the battle. Four of Lyn Xiao's\nwhite armored soldiers were poisoned and\nkilled in battle, leaving 84 white\narmored soldiers still able to fight on\nthe battlefield. Now, Lia only has the\ntroops of two lords, Lin Sha and Ding\nLelay, left to continue fighting, while\nDonging has 24 lords left. In the next\nmatch, Ding Lay was attacked by the\nJapanese Lord's elite unit, the foot\nsoldiers, and the Naga Queen was almost\ncompletely wiped out, was riddled with\narrows by the white armored Bayer. In\nthe next match, Ding Lay encountered a\ncavalry and arabus unit and was\ncompletely wiped out. Lynn Shiao was\nattacked again by Roninfoot soldiers,\nbut by Ja had learned from experience\nand wiped out the enemy at the cost of\nonly one minor injury. The dueling arena\nbattle between Lia and Donging have been\ncompleted and only the 84 white armored\nBayer warriors led by Lin Sha remain\nfrom Lshia. Although Lyn Xiao's forces\nseem to be intact, Yamamoto Isuroku had\nalready begun to sneer because the\nbattles to come will be without rest.\nThere are still 21 lords in Japan, one\nagainst 21. This is something that has\nnever happened before in history. In the\n3,000 years of Lang Shia history, there\nhas never been such a person. Everyone's\nheart was in their throat. Lyn Sha\nremained calm and composed, waving to\nthe crowd before being absorbed into the\nbattlefield by the god system. The first\nthree battles are against the elite\ntroops of the east Japan with the aim of\nwearing down the white armored Bayer as\nstamina. By Jaala remained calm and\ncollected. When encountering infantry,\nhe would use a triple attack of bows,\narrows, javelins, and axes. When\nencountering archers, he would roll\nforward and shoot them out. When\nencountering heavy cavalry, he would\nfight them off on horseback. The next\nthree battles will be a war of attrition\nagainst the white armored Bayer by the\nepic units of the east. Monk soldiers,\nbattle ninjas, and ronin took turns\nfighting, willing to sacrifice human\nlives to save the life of the white\narmored warrior. Unfortunately, the\neffect was not good, resulting only in\ntwo white armored baras being seriously\ninjured and forced to leave the field.\nThat Lyn Zhiao's white armor seemed to\nhave reached its limit. In the seventh\nmatch, the elite Japanese cavalry, the\nAquaers, make their appearance. This is\na force led by the Japanese genius date\nCaesar. The cavalrymen carry arquabus\nand lances to attack. The cavalrymen\nfirst use the arquabus to break through\nthe enemy's formation and then charge in\nwith their lances to kill.\nUnfortunately, after discovering that\nthis unit was similar to the Guan Ning\niron cavalry, the white armored Bayer\nstopped paying attention to these\nlow-budget versions of the common\npeople. On the opposite side, the\nJapanese cavalry slowly approached and\nslowly raised their arquibus. These are\nthe musketss they are holding. Due to\ntheir large caliber, they prefer to call\nthem cannons. With 300 m to go, the\nfully equipped and ready to go white\narmored ba yala began to move. I think\nI've missed something. Upon seeing the\ncavalry and arquable appear, Gene Wuang\nsuddenly said, \"I seem to remember that\nwhen these white armored Bayer people\nfirst came onto the field, they also\nseemed to be carrying something that\nlooked like a musket.\" Before Gene Wuang\ncould finish speaking, the white armored\nsoldiers each pulled out a long narrow\nmusket and aimed it at the cavalry\narcoers opposite them. What? Before date\nsea bureau could react, the white\narmored Bayer took the initiative and\nfired a volley of musketss. The final\noutcome is self-evident. The white\narmored soldiers who were old rivals of\nthe Guan Ning iron cavalry had long\nsince developed counter measures against\nthe Guan Ning Iron Cavalry's musketss.\nThey had a longer range and after firing\ntheir arrows, they charged with bows and\narrows and finally charged with lances.\nOnly a dozen or so riders fell from\ntheir horses and they annihilated the\nJapanese elite cavalry and arabisers on\nthe other side. At this point, Lyn Shao\nstill had 75 white armored Ba Yala\nmembers. There are still 14 lords left\nin Japan. There was no time to rest. The\nbattle resumed. Chapter 189. Endless\nexhaustion. White armored soldiers after\n20 consecutive battles. The Dragon Xiao\nfans watching the live stream were on\ntenor hooks the whole time. If Lynn Shia\nhad lost outright, no one would have\nblamed him since he was the lord who\nheld out until the very end. But Lyn Sha\nfought seven matches without losing and\nhis strength was still relatively\nintact. If Lyn Sha could continue to\nfight 14 more rounds of gauntlet battles\nand win the final duel, no one would\ndare to believe it. But for some reason,\neveryone was secretly waiting for\nsomething. As if there was a sliver of\nhope that a miracle might happen. The\ndomain lord's judgment is correct.\nSomeone murmured. Maybe Lyn Sha really\ncan bring about a miracle. Some people\nsaid, \"Even though he has achieved this\nmuch, I think Lynn Shiao is a rising\nstar that Lia will focus on cultivating.\nHe may very well become the chief lord\nin the future. Old devil, you're also a\nchief lord. What do you say?\" Gene Wuang\nsnorted coldly in dissatisfaction. It\nseems you finally remembered that I am a\nchief lord. So, do you think Lin Sha can\nwin or not? It's&lt;unk&gt; hard to say. This\ntime, Gene Wuang did not directly deny\nit, but gave an ambiguous answer, which\nshows that with his experience, he did\nnot dare to make a conclusion about Lin\nSha, who had repeatedly created\nmiracles. While everyone was discussing,\nLynn Sha had already started fighting.\nIt seems that Japan is determined to\nwear down Lin Sha and will overwhelm him\nif necessary. Bastard like madman. These\nsoldiers seem to be excited as if they\nhad been injected with chicken blood and\nas fearless as heroic martyrs. They\ncompletely disregarded their own losses.\nEven if a group of them died, they would\nhold off one white armored soldier,\nleaving the others a chance to kill him.\nFour, five consecutive matches. All the\nunits used were epic level units,\nincluding melee, ranged cavalry,\narchers, and assassins, charging\nheadlong into battle without any\nstrategy. At first, the white armored\nBayer could use their bows and arrows\nand horsemanship to fly kites and defend\nthemselves with spears. But by the\nfourth battle, Baja Bayer had run out of\narrows. Even the best archers among the\nwhite armored soldiers only carried 70\narrows each. In the relentless non-stop\nbattles where they could neither rest\nnor replenish their arrows. Once their\narrows ran out, the white armored\nsoldiers lost a major weapon for wearing\ndown the enemy without taking any\ndamage. After running out of arrows, the\nwhite armored soldiers still had\nmusketss. But by the fifth battle, their\nmusketss, which had limited ammunition,\nhad also run out. The white armored\nsoldiers also had steel javelins, which\ncould be recycled, but each soldier only\nhad four. and the throwing distance was\nnot far enough. Thus, in the sixth\nbattle, when they encountered the epic\narchers from the east again, the white\narmored soldiers inevitably suffered\ncasualties. The opposing archers clearly\nrealized that the white armored soldiers\nranged attacks had become ineffective,\nso they tried to wear them down with\nranged attacks. At Actton's command, the\nwhite armored soldiers mounted their\nhorses and transformed into heavily\narmored cavalry, wielding long spears\nand charging forward amidst a hail of\narrows. This time, after annihilating\nall the Japanese archers, the white\narmored Bayer still had 67 men left. In\nthe seventh scene, the Japanese heavy\ninfantry made their appearance. The\nwhite armored Bayer fought footto-foot\nusing javelins and axes to inflict heavy\nlosses on the opposing heavy infantry\nand then use spears and swords to engage\nin close combat and annihilate the\nenemy. There are still 63 members left\nin the white armor Baya. This is not the\nlevel that Linhao's white armored\nsoldiers should have. Someone in the\nlive stream noticed the problem.\nLogically speaking, even without bows\nand arrows, the white armored soldiers\nshould have no losses when fighting\nagainst infantry. Well, Gene Wuang,\nwe've all overlooked one thing. By jaala\nas stamina is starting to decline.\nEveryone was odd. Since his debut, Bja\nBayera has fought in 20 battles. Even if\nwe only consider the series of matches,\nBja Bayera has already fought 14 matches\nwithout stopping. In 20 battles, more\nthan 1,700 enemies were killed with each\nwhite armored Bayer killing an average\nof nearly 20 enemies. Keep in mind that\nthe opposing team consists of units with\nexcellent base stats, epic base stats,\nand several gold legendary units, each\nof which is extremely powerful. Now that\nthe fighting has reached this point, the\nlords of the Eastern Kingdom are no\nlonger concerned with their own lives,\nonly caring about exchanging lives for\nlives. piling up white armored by a lot\nto death. Such an enemy is even more\ninsane. Despite this situation, the\nwhite armored soldiers fought 20\nbattles. If it were any type of unit\ntoday, even the three great nightly\norders of Europe, even the physically\npowerful demons, even the tireless rock\ngolems, even the titan golems that mages\nlove the most. Gene Wuang believed they\nhad all died from exhaustion long ago.\nThese white armored Bayer have managed\nto maintain their fighting strength and\nmorale for so long. So Lyn Xiao's white\narmored soldiers have been fighting for\nthis long. Someone in the live stream\nsaid, \"He's persisted for so long. So\nlong that we thought his soldiers could\njust keep going indefinitely. I doubt\neven the legendary angel has the\nstrength left to fight this far.\" This\nman's words resonated with everyone and\nthey were all surprised to realize the\nformidable strength of Bjaala. Who\nexactly are these men with fierce\nlooking faces? Everyone looked at\nLynsha. The battle continued and Lynn\nSha did not teleport back to the rest\narea. He remained watching the battle\nfrom above the battlefield within the\nLord's area set by the god system. He\nremained silent, his expression still,\nhis gaze distant. warriors fight\nsilently, neither giving orders nor\ninterfering, letting these fierce\nwarriors fight according to his own\nideas. Lyn Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s face revealed\nneither joy nor sorrow, and no one knew\nwhat he was thinking. But just seeing\nhim standing quietly, looking so\nconfident, everyone felt there was still\nhope. Even so, Baija Bayala still has\nseven battles to fight. Next up, the\ncavalry. The white armored Bayer lined\nup to resist the enemy, annihilating the\nenemy army, leaving 45 men remaining.\nNext up, the assassin by Ja Bayer used\nup almost all of his consumable items to\nset traps and consumable weapons to\nintercept assassins, annihilating the\nenemy army. Only 41 enemy soldiers\nremained before Baija Bayer could even\nretrieve his steel rod. The next battle\nbegan. Next up, the archer. The white\narmored Bayer charged again,\nannihilating the enemy army. However, in\nthis battle, the epic archers of the\nEastern Kingdom shot only at the horses,\nsacrificing their own lives for their\nhorses lives, killing almost all of\nthem. Next up, swordsmen and shieldmen.\nWhite armored Bayer can only engage in\nclose combat with swords and shields. As\nbattle after battle raged, the roars of\nthe white armored soldiers on the\nbattlefield gradually turned into howls\nand silence. The expressions of the\npeople from Lsha Kingdom grew\nincreasingly solemn and worried.\nYamamoto Iseroka's expression grew\nincreasingly contorted and furious.\nDespite repeated battles fought with the\nsame desperate tactics, the white\narmored Bayer have not yet been\ncompletely defeated. Even though the\nremaining white armored barbarians could\nbarely lift their hands and their faces\nwere covered in blood from their eyes.\nEven though their white armor was no\nlonger visible and had been completely\nreplaced by red and black. Even though\ntheir armor was almost completely\ndamaged and offered little protection,\ntheir weapons were almost all used up\nwith spears broken and swords dulled and\nsome of them were using stolen weapons.\nBut the white armored Bayer kept\nwinning. He stayed on the battlefield.\nThe troops that Yamamoto Isuroku sent\nwere mercilessly killed one by one by\nthe white armored soldiers. Finally,\nYamamoto Isuroku had only one lord and\none last type of soldier left. The\nshadow warriors assault team is almost\nat full strength. Only 13 white armored\nBayer, their armor tattered, their\nweapons broken, and barely able to\nstand. The battle continues. Chapter\n190, Battle of Soldiers. Victory. The\nwarriors fate. Lyn Shao stood silently\nin midair on the battlefield. 13 men by\nJa Beaala fought 26 battles, killing\nmore than 2,000 enemies, while his own\nforce dwindled from 100 to 13. Lyn Sha\nfelt a little ironic thinking about how\nwild boar skin from that world also\nstarted out with 13 suits of armor. On\nthe opposite side, the Japanese lord\nfilled with madness and smuggness was\nteleported in. His face was contorted,\nand he stared at Lin Sha with a fierce\nlook as if he were about to grind his\nteeth to powder. Chinese, your soldiers\ncan't hold out. Their armor was\ncompletely destroyed. Their weapons were\neither dulled or broken. They are all\ninjured and exhausted. They can barely\nstand up. And I, my shadow warrior\ncommando team, still has 93 members, all\nat their peak. This is one of the elite\nunits of our great Japan. A legendary\ngold unit capable of assassination and\nmelee combat. Its speed and agility are\nunmatched. What do you have to fight me\nwith? The young Japanese lord was\nspitting as he spoke, seemingly venting\nall the pain he felt watching Lyn\nXiao&lt;unk&gt;s white armored Bajara kill his\nteammates one by one and all the torment\nhe had endured while waiting silently.\nLyn Sha, give up. If I were you, I would\nsurrender now. Otherwise, these 13\nwarriors are destined to die under my\nshadow warriors blade. If you surrender,\nyou can save these 13 lives. These 13\npeople will be grateful to you for the\nrest of their lives. You'll also\nestablish an image of treating soldiers\nwell in everyone's eyes. Recruiting\nsoldiers will be much easier in the\nfuture. Can you bear to let warriors\nwith no hope of victory die in vain?\nThey killed so many people for you,\nfought over 20 battles for you, and have\nearned you enough honor by fighting to\nthis extent. Give up now. Your results\nare good enough, Lyn Sha. No one will\nblame you for not persevering. Did you\nhear that? The young Japanese lord's\nwords were piercing, their echoes\nreverberating across the battlefield. He\nwaited for Lyn Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s reply with a\ncold smile, not forgetting to raise his\nhand high. If Lyn Xiao's answer is no,\nor if Lin Shao delays by not answering,\nhe can issue the attack order at any\ntime. Restore the white armored soldiers\nstamina. Not a chance. Hearing the words\nof the Lord opposite him, Lyn Ziao's\ngaze slowly descended and landed on the\ngroup of white armored soldiers. Just\nthen, Actton slowly turned around, his\nface covered in blood with only one eye\nopen, and slowly met Lin Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s\ngaze. Lyn Sha and Actton stared at each\nother for two seconds. Lyn Sha nodded\nslowly and Actton slowly turned his head\naway. How is it, Lyn Sha? The Japanese\nlord laughed exaggeratedly. Are you\nready to surrender? You've already\nabandoned your troops. No, Lyn Sha said\nslowly. I will not surrender, nor will\nmy troops. The Japanese lord's gaze\nturned cold. Do you really intend to be\nso cold-blooded towards your own troops?\nYour actions will make all branches of\nthe military lose faith in you. My\ntroops say that the best fate for the\nWhite Armor Bayera is to use up all\ntheir weapons in the final battle, kill\nthe last enemy, and then die of\nexhaustion. Lyn Sha said coldly. He\nwon't stop until he's wiped out all of\nyou Japanese devils. You, the Japanese\nlord roared. Since you don't care about\nthe lives of your soldiers, don't blame\nme. He swung his arm fiercely and the 93\nshadow warriors vanished in the form of\ngreen smoke. When he reappeared, the\nshadow warrior was less than 10 m away\nfrom the white armored Bayer. Shuriken\nflew out and the battle began. In a\nsingle exchange, half of the white\narmored Baraf fell to the ground. Many\nof the viewers of the live stream\ncouldn't bear to close their eyes. They\nalso agreed with the Japanese lord's\nwords. Lyn Sha was already strong enough\nto have come this far. But these\nexhausted white armored soldiers could\nnot possibly defeat the well-rested\nshadow warriors. They couldn't bear to\nwatch the massacre. They just wanted to\nclose their eyes and wait for the\nnotification sound from the god system\nindicating the end of the battle. 1\nminute, 2 minutes, 3 minutes. The\nexpected notification tone never\nsounded, and some people couldn't help\nbut open their eyes. Oh my god. The\nscene before him left him speechless for\na long time. The fierce battle\ncontinued, leaving behind a field\nlittered with the corpses of shadow\nwarriors and white armored soldiers of\nthe Baija Bayer remain. The battlefield\nwas piled high with corpses, making it\ndifficult to walk, and the blood had\nturned the ground at deep dark black. by\nJaba Yala fought relentlessly using his\nfists to hammer, his teeth to bite, his\narms to lock, and even his braid to\nstrangle the enemy. The shadow warrior s\nshuriken was deeply embedded in the body\nof the white armored Bayer, who\nimmediately pulled it out and used it as\na weapon to stab another shadow warrior\nin the eye socket. The shadow warrior\nleaped and slashed almost cleaving into\nhis chest from the shoulder, but was\ncaught by the white armored Bayer, who\ngrabbed the shadow warrior's blade,\nseized him, and smashed his head to\npieces with a headbutt. The onlookers\nstared, mouth agape, their eyes\nrevealing shock, tragedy, and anger.\nThey watched as Lia&lt;unk&gt;s troops fought\n27 battles, battling until they were out\nof ammunition and food. Yet they still\nrefused to give up and continued to\nfight to the death. An indescribable\nemotion quickly welled up in their\nhearts, bringing tears to many eyes and\nchoking their voices. The onlookers\nwatched with tears in their eyes as the\nshadow warrior and the white armored\nBayer fell one by one until no one moved\nanymore. The shadow warrior and the\nwhite armored Bayer s corpses were\nscattered all over the ground. No, there\nis still one person who can move. It was\na one-eyed man in white armor. He pushed\naside the corpse that was pressing down\non him. Slowly stood up and looked\ncoldly at the Japanese lord who was\nalready sitting on the ground in shock\nwith his single eye. He had dozens of\nwounds on his body. His three layers of\narmor were long gone. His helmet was\nknocked off and his braid was broken off\nduring the battle. He was almost covered\nin blood. Even when he stood up, blood\nkept gushing from his mouth. But he is\nstill alive. That was the captain of the\nwhite armor Bayera, the number one\nBeturu of Shing Jing or going to act.\nDing. Battle over. All units of the\nJapanese player have been eliminated,\nresulting in a loss for the player. With\na flash of light, Lin Sha and the last\nsurvivor, Actton, were teleported away\nand disappeared. Lyn Sha won. You won.\nWe won. After a brief silence, a wave of\ncheers suddenly swept in, echoing\nthroughout the entire chat area. Upon\nreturning, Lin Sha, without taking a\nbreak, immediately took Actton to the\nsanatorium where the team doctor brought\nby Chu Yusi immediately began to treat\nActton. Actton, lying on the floor, was\nbarely breathing. \"We have lived up to\nthe title of Bayer,\" Actton said\nhaltingly. \"My lord, dying now is the\nbest possible end for a warrior. We just\nhaven't made amends for the mistakes we\nmade. Keep going. Lynn Shia interrupted\nActton before he could continue\nspeaking, saying, \"You're just soldiers.\nWhat's wrong with that? Even if you made\nany mistakes, you have already redeemed\nyourself through the battle, so there is\nno need to mention it again.\" Lyn Sha\ngrasped Actton's hand. From this day\nforward, the Manchu warriors will\nforever be members of the Chinese nation\nin this world. Actton's usually cold and\nfierce eyes lit up for the first time.\nThen he tilted his head to the side and\nclosed his eyes tightly. Cheating.\nCheating. Yamamoto Isuroku's furious\nroar also rang out on the international\nchannel at that moment. Chapter 191. The\npath of white armor taking it to the\nUnited Nations. Cheating. Longa is\ncheating. Yamamoto Isuroku's shrill\nvoice rang out. Yamamoto Isuroku. You\ncan't accept defeat, can you? Chu Yusi\nimmediately responded, \"What kind of\nbehavior is it to yell and scream when\nyou lose?\" Yamamoto 57 said, \"I have\nevery reason to believe that Lynn Sha\ncheated. I just inquired with the top\nlords of Western Europe, including the\nRothschild and Jacob families with\nlong-standing traditions. They frankly\nadmitted that even their angels could\nnot withstand 27 consecutive battles\nagainst the military strength of my\neastern kingdom. Moreover, even when the\nlast soldier was killed and all\nammunition and food were exhausted, no\none deserted or betrayed them, not even\nwith 100 points of loyalty. Lyn Sha must\nhave used some strange method to cheat.\nAs soon as Yamamoto Isuroku finished\nspeaking, Chu Yusi laughed in anger.\nRidiculous. A battle witnessed by the\ngod system can be cheated. Chu yusi\nsaid, \"You Japanese really are like\nthis. When you win, you win. But when\nyou lose, you accuse others of\ncheating.\" Yamamoto Isuroku. What if I\nsaid, \"I suspect that Lyn Xiao's troops\nare colluding with the demons.\" Everyone\nwas taken aback with demons is a serious\ncrime. Yamamoto Isuroku slowly said, \"As\neveryone knows, the demon race's\nsoldiers are fearless and physically\npowerful, and these white armored\nsoldiers.\" Humph Yamamoto Isuroku\nsneered. The white armored soldiers look\nso ugly and fierce. They might be a new\ntype of soldier developed by the demon\nraces Andrea, and the relationship\nbetween Lin Shia and Andrea is the talk\nof the town. Someone immediately\nretorted, \"Are the white armored\nsoldiers human or demon? Doesn't the god\nsystem know that? If they were demons,\nhow could they be allowed to participate\nin this competition? He he, you're all\ntoo naive. As long as the white armored\nsoldier has a higher percentage of human\nblood, the god system will determine\nthat he is still human. Yamamoto isoku\nretorted. It's very simple to do this\nhybridization. Lyn Sha provided the\nhuman race and Andrea provided the demon\nrace. Through hybridization, a new type\nof human demon hybrid was born. These\nwhite armored soldiers must have been\ncreated in the same way. Just like Lynn\nShia and Andrea being together, that's\nhybridization. Seeing that everyone was\nsilent, Yamamoto isku continued. Anyway,\nif you don't give me an explanation\ntoday and tell me the real secret of by\nja yala, our donging kingdom will\ndefinitely lodge a strong protest\nagainst your langa's actions and we will\nreport the unusual situation of Lin\nShiao and by Jaob. Take this to the\nUnited Nations. Yamamoto Isuroku's words\nshocked everyone. Andrea, demons,\nhybrids, one after another, these\nunheard of secrets left everyone in\nshock and confusion. forgetting to\nrefute him for a moment. At this moment,\nyou, Yamamoto Isuroku. I thought\nyou'd be a bit stronger, but you're just\nlike Kenzo Door. You cheat when you\ncan't win and always try to shift the\nblame onto me for the demon race. Can\nthe demon race really be used as a\nscapegoat to contain everything? Lyn Sha\nspoke angrily, directly naming Yamamoto\nIoku and cursing his entire family. You,\nhow can you be so undignified as an\nofficial? How can you use foul language?\nYamamoto Isuroku was taken aback. He was\nforced to retreat step by step by Lyn\nXiao's angry scolding, and his momentum\nwas completely gone. He could only\nstammer. There's no dignity in talking\nto a beast like you. You can't insult\nme. I'm a high-ranking official from\nJapan. If you insult me again, I'll\nlodge a diplomatic protest with your\ndragon kingdom. You said you wanted to\nprotest last time, which led to this\narena. This arena still can't shut you\nup. Don't you have any shame? You,\nYamamoto, Iceoka blushed. I didn't need\nto prove anything. Lyn Sha said, but in\norder to let all the beasts know that I,\nLyn Shao, am innocent and that the Lsha\ntroops are also innocent human troops, I\nwill tell everyone the secret of the\nwhite armor Bayer. The atmosphere, which\nhad been somewhat noisy due to the\nargument between Lin Shiao and Yamamoto\nIsuroku, instantly became completely\nquiet. Even Yamamoto Isuroku himself\ndidn't retort. He nudged his attendants,\nsignaling them to get their notes ready\nwhile he listened intently for Lin Sha\nto continue. Baija is the strongest\nwarrior among the tribes that survived\nthe hardships of a dangerous region. Lyn\nSha slowly began to speak there. For\nmost of the year, there is biting cold\nwind and endless snow. It's difficult to\ncultivate the land there, and there\naren't enough grasslands for grazing.\nThere are only continuous forests and\nrivers. The people who live there fight\nthe fiercest battle for survival every\nday. They hunt, they fish, and most of\nthem have mastered superb archery, trap\nsetting, and trap detection skills.\nBecause if we don't catch any prey, we\nmight starve to death tomorrow. The\nharsh life also cultivated their\nextraordinary endurance, physical\nstrength beyond that of ordinary people\nand barbaric customs. Almost everyone in\nthis group was a soldier and everyone\nwas a skilled fighter because if they\nwere not strong enough, they would be\nkilled by their prey. Later, this group\nof people were conscripted by the\nconquerors and became real soldiers.\nTheir fierce determination in struggling\non the brink of death, and their honed\nskills quickly made them outstanding\nwarriors. Lynn Shiao said loudly, \"This\nis my unit. Why do we use so many\nweapons? Why are we physically strong?\nWhy do we fight to the death? Why do we\nuse any means necessary? This is the\nresult of their struggle against wild\nbeasts and nature. But that's not\nenough. Not enough to reach such a\nformidable level.\" Yamamoto Isuroku\nshook his head in disbelief. O, this is\njust the beginning. Lyn Shao smiled\nfaintly and said, \"These barbarians can\njoin the army as early as 15 years old.\nAfter joining the army, there is an\nopportunity to become an unarmored\nordinary infantryman. Only those who\nbecome familiar with the battlefield and\nsurvive will receive rudimentary armor\nand become armored soldiers. And then\nthey will begin the assessment. Those\nwho pass the test will be assigned to\nthe infantry and those who excel will be\nassigned to the cavalry. Then based on\nthe number of kills on the battlefield,\nthose who kill more will be promoted.\nSlaying a level 100 opponent grants you\nthe ability to wear red armor. Lin Sha\nsaid, \"You have to kill a 100 enemies to\nbecome a red armored Bayer. Then select\nthe best archer and horsemen among the\nred armored warriors to be the white\narmored Bayer.\" So you understand now,\nright? The reason why the white armored\nBayer are so powerful is because each of\nthem emerged from mountains of corpses\nand seas of blood. Even in such a\nbarbaric tribe, hundreds of thousands of\npeople could only muster a few hundred\nwhite armored warriors. Each of them is\na master hunter, a master killer, a\nmaster weapon maker, a master trapper, a\nmaster horsemen, and a master archer.\nThey are the strongest warriors in that\ntribe. These hundred white armored Bayer\nhave already taken more than 10,000\nlives. So why are they so powerful?\nBecause they cannot afford to fail. They\nonly have victory or death. Demons? We\ndon't need demons to crossbreed with.\nThese people are already devils enough.\nLyn Sha sneered and said, \"As for you,\nYamamoto Isuroku, how could you know\nthat demons can interbreed with humans?\nAre you just like douan crying stop\nthief in the thief's name? Immersed in\nthe legendary selection process of Bai\nYamamoto Isuroku finally snapped out of\nit and hurriedly said, \"Don't talk\nnonsense. This is just a guess. Guess?\nYou're making wild guesses based on the\ninnocence of a Long Sha official? I'm\nlodging a diplomatic protest with you.\"\nLyn Shao said, \"In response to your\ninsults to our side, in the upcoming\nduel, Japan must pay each of our heroes\nan appearance fee of 100,000 silver\ncoins in advance before we will\nparticipate. Otherwise, I will report\nthe matter of Japan framing Liao\nofficials to the United Nations.\"\nChapter 192. Acceptance, great\nreputation, visitors. Good. Lyn Shao\nimmediately used the same tactics\nagainst Yamamoto Isuroku, leaving him\nspeechless and unable to refute. Upon\nseeing this, everyone cheered loudly.\nAre we only allowed to bully Long Sea\nfrom Japan, but not allowed to fight\nback? You Japanese always throw around\naccusations, lodge diplomatic protests,\nand threaten to take it all the way to\nthe United Nations. Now Lynn Shiao is\npresenting the facts and reasoning and\nby Jaaya as suspicions have been\ncleared. He's going to turn the tables\non you and take your slander of Liao\nofficials to the United Nations.\nRegardless of whether Yamamoto Isuroku\nwill agree to Lyn Xiao's outrageous\ndemands. Seeing Yamamoto Isuroku\nspeechless, everyone felt a great sense\nof relief. As expected, to deal with\nJapan, you need someone like Lynn Shiao\nwho doesn't play by the rules and is\ntruly determined when things get tough.\nYou What do you mean you? If you're bad,\npractice more. If you can't handle\nlosing, don't play. Yamamoto Isuroku\ndared not speak again and slunk off the\ncomputer, leaving only Lin Xiao shouts\nbehind him and the laughter of the\nothers. Remember to pay your appearance\nfee or we'll beat you to a pulp in the\nduel later. Haha. Shaking his head, Lyn\nSha also logged off. Before him lay\nActton's face, serene as if he were\nasleep. Upon seeing Yamamoto Isuroku's\nslanderous remarks, Lyn Sha disregarded\nthe aftermath and immediately engaged in\nbattle. Angrily revealing the origins of\nthe white armored Bayer, thus giving\nthese hundred warriors who fought to the\ndeath a final honor. If they actually\nrecruited the Bay army, perhaps they\nwould perform better in the face of this\nrelentless attack. Lyn Sha thought to\nhimself, \"Even if half of the Bayway\narmy were to die, let alone 100, my\nheart would ache so much I couldn't\nbreathe.\" As for the white clad by a\nllama, to be honest, from the very\nbeginning of his time on the field, Lyn\nSha knew that he wouldn't be too\nheartbroken if this type of soldier\ndied. Because at that time, Lyn Shao\nalways regarded the Baija Bayer as a\nforeign race. until the final battle,\nuntil the white armored Bayer fulfilled\nthe glory of warriors, and the entire\narmy was wiped out. \"Well,\" Lyn Sha\nsighed softly and grasped Actton's hand.\n\"After this battle, I have come to\nunderstand your hearts. You are just a\ngroup of warriors. All you've ever\nwanted is to be part of my large family.\nIf I recruit Bayer again next time, I\nwill try my best to make myself and\neveryone in the territory except you.\"\nOf course, the premise is that you must\nnot keep your cues anymore. That's the\nprinciple. I will acknowledge that you\nare also part of China. Farewell,\nBeturu, Lynn Shiao said solemnly, gently\nputting down Actton's hand, which was\ncovered with calluses and wounds. The\nwhite armored Bayer was the latest unit\nLin Sha recruited, but it was the only\nunit to be wiped out as a whole. After\nsaying goodbye to Actton, Lyn Sha turned\nand left. Huh? The deputy city lord. The\nteam doctor in the distance suddenly\ncalled out to Lyn Sha, \"Is there\nsomething you need?\" Lyn Shao composed\nhimself and asked with a question in his\nmind. \"Why didn't you take your soldiers\nwith you when you left?\" \"K,\ndeputy city lord, take this big guy back\nto rest as well. It's really\ninconvenient to leave him here. Rest.\"\nLyn Sha blinked. He isn't dead. He's not\ndead. The team doctor blinked. I'm an\nA-rank medical lord. I can bring someone\nback to life in less than 3 minutes if\ntheir head is severed. I didn't say he\nwas dead, did I? But just now, his head\ntilted to the side and his eyes closed\nheavily. That was due to exhaustion. So,\nI used the tortoise breathing therapy on\nhim to allow his body functions to\nrecover slowly and avoid leaving any\nafter effects. Before the team doctor\ncould finish speaking, Lynn Sha walked\nover awkwardly, waved his hand, and took\nActton back to his territory. I have\nsomething to do. I'll be going now. Yes,\ndeputy city lord. Seeing Lynn Sha vanish\nin a flash of light, the team doctor\nlaughed heartily. I never expected that\nthe deputy city lord who treats enemies\nwith the harshness of winter would be so\nadorable when he's embarrassed. Dough\nBing won. And according to the rules of\nthe heroic martial arts arena, Lia has\nalready scored two points. Next is the\nduel and the winner gets three points.\nThe final duel between lords will award\nfive points to the winner. With Lia\nhaving secured the first victory, the\nchat channel was filled with a joyful\natmosphere. Celebrate. Celebrate. I'm\ngoing to celebrate all day long before\ntomorrow's duel begins. How many years\nhas it been since we've had a victory?\nSo, let's have a few drinks to celebrate\ntoday. Thank you to everyone who fought\nbravely. Thank you, city lord Lyn Shao,\nand thank you, Queen Dugu. It was her\ndiscerning eye that discovered Lyn\nXiao's talent. Ha. Lyn Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s\nreputation continued to rise, spreading\nacross the vast land of Lia, whether in\ncities or villages, whether in the real\ncountry of Langia or the battlefield of\nall races in the Lia domain through the\nlive broadcast of the main god system\nand the widespread praise from person to\nperson. In addition, the processing and\nembellishment by information middlemen.\nWherever there is well water, one knows\nLyn Sha. A clear, melodious voice rang\nout from within the ancient palace. If\nyou're bad at the game, practice more.\nIf you can't handle losing, don't play.\nAn interesting kid. The clear, melodious\nvoice seemed to be conversing with\nsomeone. By the way, Shaolon, have you\nmoved over yet? Not yet. Why are you so\nslow? Are you embarrassed? The women of\nour Dugu family are no less than men. We\ndo things entirely according to our own\nwill. So why should we care about the\nopinions of others? You played an\nextraordinary role in the past as I have\nalready mentioned. It's not like I'm\nasking you to move in with him. What's\nthere to be embarrassed about? You've\nalready told him. No, you only mentioned\nby Jia. You can be sure he's connected\nto the ancient demons. Yes, that's what\nI think too. You want to outdo him in\nthe duel and then move over to carry out\nthe mission. Okay, let's do it as soon\nas possible. Ancient demons are not some\nheinous species. Don't forget, we also\nhave intricate connections with ancient\ndemons. It must be kept secret. After\nthe call ended, the clear, melodious\nvoice seemed to be talking to itself.\nI'm starting to understand Andrea better\nnow. She's quite an interesting lad. I'm\nbecoming more and more interested in\nhim. By the way, we should ask Jabbron\nAndrea about her recent activities.\nShe's been quiet for a while now.\nKnowing her personality, she's\ndefinitely brewing something big.\nFollowing the battle, Lynn Sha returned\nto his territory. Everything in the\nterritory was in perfect order, even\nmore prosperous than when I was there.\nAll of this was managed by his strongest\nall-around hero, Wong Ming, Wong Jinglu.\nLyn Shiao granted Wong Ming the highest\nlevel of authority besides his own and\nBaois. The golden farmers continue to be\nsummoned, constantly cultivating one\ngolden field after another. And with the\nsuper special effect of eternal peace,\nthey continuously produce highquality\ngrains. Two barracks and several hero\nspecific buildings are constantly\nrecruiting powerful Chinese soldiers,\ncontinuously replenishing Lin Xiao\nstrength. Even the various buildings are\nupgrading themselves, making the most of\nevery opportunity to improve. The flower\nfairies were working in the mines near\nthe border. While in the deeper valleys,\nwild monsters were shouting slogans as\nthey enthusiastically dug into the\nveins. Their many heroes lead various\ntroop types to farm and fight monsters\nin the vast wilderness outside their\nterritory. Lyn Sha was about to find\nWong Ming to inquire about the territory\nsituation. My lord, you're back. A\nstunningly beautiful woman in a dark red\ncloak ran out in surprise and threw\nherself into Lyn Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s arms. Ma Lyn\nShiao felt the warmth of the beauty in\nhis arms and gently stroked Bao&lt;unk&gt;s\nhair. He Ba greets the city lord.\nNaughty, I'll punish you. Lyn Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s\nhand gently landed. Uh my lord, please\ndon't. We have guests here. Um chapter\n193. Dugu Jaolan and Baoi. Payman's good\nfortune. Um, a guest has arrived. Lyn\nShao realized what was happening and\nturned around. He saw a beautiful figure\nstanding not far behind him, looking at\nhim with a half smile. My lord, please\nforgive me. Ba whispered. When the lord\nleft, he handed over the territo's\nauthority to Mr. Wong Ming.\nCoincidentally, Miss Dugu wanted to\nvisit and Wong Ming asked for my\nopinion. I remembered that the lord said\nthat apart from the three vassel lords,\nMiss Dugu and young master Chu could\ncome and go freely within the territory.\nSo I agreed. It's&lt;unk&gt; all right. Lyn\nSha waved his hand. Dugu Jaon slowly\napproached. These past few days, every\ntime I see you, beautiful women throw\nthemselves into your arms. Dugu Jaolon\nparted her lips slightly and said\nsoftly, you're quite the lucky one, old\nclassmate. Haha, old squad leader.\nWelcome, welcome. Lyn Sha quickly\nstepped forward. I, Lynsha, am a\ngentleman. I have no other companion but\nBaoi. Please don't misunderstand, old\nsquad leader. Oh, so you're admitting to\nhaving a relationship with this heroine.\nDugu Jaolan slowly looked at Baoi and\nBaoi also raised her head, looking at\nDugu Jaolan with a slight shyness. One\nis a young woman, not yet 20, and the\nother is a legendary figure who has\nlived for thousands of years and even\nserved as a queen. Yet their\ntemperaments are completely opposite.\nLike her aunt, Doug Jaolon was aloof and\nelegant with an unconscious air of\nsuperiority. Baoi was alluring,\nseductive, pure and gentle, and mature\nand captivating. But her temperament was\nmore delicate. The two stunning beauties\nmet only once and even though they were\nboth friendly and there was no conflict,\nLynn Shiao discovered that their roles\nin the family were completely different.\nOne was a bright and elegant lady, the\nhead of the household. The other was a\ncharming and gentle concubine. I just\ndon't know which man is worthy of a\nwoman like Dugu Jalon as top tier in\nterms of family background, beauty, and\nability. Lin Sha nodded and said to Dugu\nJaon, \"Of course, Baoi has feelings for\nme, and I cannot be ungrateful to her.\nBaoi is my companion, and everyone in my\nterritory knows this. Even outside, many\npeople know that boss Lin Sha was\nrewarded by the system with a hidden\nfemale hero,\" said Lonely Gallon with a\nhalf smile. Lyn Shiao and she exchanged\na glance and smiled knowingly. \"By the\nway, I didn't know that the class\nmonitor had graced us with his presence.\nWhat can I do for you? Can I come if I\ndon't have any instructions? Dugu Jaolan\nsmiled mysteriously. Just consider this\na visit between old friends. May I\nwander around your territory? Sure. Lin\nShiao along with Dugu Jaalon and Baoi\nstrolled through the territory. At this\nmoment, the heroes were all fighting on\nthe frontier, and there weren't many\ntroops patrolling the territory. So the\ngroup simply watched the farmers and\nflower fairies working in the territory\nand chatted about everyday matters from\ntime to time. Dugu Jaolon was\naccompanied by two women who\noccasionally glanced at Lynsha. Both of\nthem were tall and slender. One of the\nfemale soldiers was heroic and spirited\nwith bright and lively eyes. She would\noccasionally glance at Lin Sha with a\ncurious look. The other person was a few\npoints taller than Dugu Jaolan with a\nEuropean appearance, wearing a golden\nmask that covered the upper half of his\nface, and his right hand and left leg\nappeared to be golden prosthetics. A\nguest flashed through Lin Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s\nmind. Just then, Wong Ming walked over\nwith Pay Min. My lord, young Master Pay\nMin has completed his leveling up and is\nnow at level 49, 90% complete. I have\nalready forbidden him from further\ntraining. then let young master pay Min\naccompany the lord. Upon seeing Pay Min,\nDugu Jaolon&lt;unk&gt;s eyes lit up. The two\nfemale attendants behind him also turned\ntheir gazes over, staring intently at\nPay Min. Pay Min was dressed in spotless\nwhite, his face with sharp features,\nexuding a carefree and unrestrained air\nwith a slight smile playing on his lips.\nSo your hero in white is called Pay Min.\nDugu Jalon nodded. This humble one, Pay\nMin, greets Lord Dugu. Pay Min knew that\nthe visitors were distinguished guests,\nso he greeted them politely and then\naccompanied them for a walk. Speaking of\nwhich, I have to thank you for reminding\nme of Baijabaya s pursuit, Lin Shiao\nsaid sincerely to Dugu Jaolan. If it\nweren't for your reminder, I might not\nhave been able to unleash their full\npotential and achieve victory in the\nbattle. You're welcome. I only happened\nto see this record in an ancient book,\nDugu Jaolan said casually. He he\nunintentionally. An ancient book? The\nold squad leader's words were quite\nprofound. Where can you find any ancient\nChinese books these days? Anyone who can\nsee ancient books is practically\nconnected to ancient demons. Lyn Shia\nchuckled, not exposing Dugu Jaon&lt;unk&gt;s\nwords. The two strolled and chatted for\na while longer before Dugu Jaon took her\nleave. After the three of them\ndisappeared through the portal, Pay Min\nstretched and lazily said, \"There's\nalways been a feeling that she's\ninspecting her future home, choosing a\ngood spot for herself to move in.\" Lynn\nSha chuckled. How could you have such a\nthought? Of course, the only one worthy\nof Lord is this Miss Dugu. You two are\nclassmates, so you have an advantage of\nbeing close by. In my opinion, it's\nperfect that she's moving in. The Lord's\nharm needs a principal wife like Miss\nDugu to keep things in order. Nonsense.\nDoes the Lord not find Miss Dugu\nattractive? Or is it that he can no\nlonger tolerate other women after\nmarrying Miss Ba? Ba who was standing to\nthe side quickly grabbed Lyn Xiao's arm.\nBa is just a hero. It is already a great\nhonor for me to accompany the Lord. The\nLord must not delay his important matter\nof getting married and starting a family\nbecause of Baoi. Lyn Sha waved his hand,\nsignaling Baoi to calm down. Well, Baoi\nhas directly positioned herself as a\nconcubine. She's truly born with the\ndivine body of a concubine. Gurudu\nJaolon is a member of one of the four\nmost powerful families in Lshia today.\nNo matter if it is for political reasons\nor other reasons, it is impossible for\nhim to be with a commoner. Lynn Shao\nfrankly told his partner Baoi as well as\nPay Min who was both his master and\nservant and his friend. Ah, no wonder\nthe Lord has already become the deputy\ncity lord. Pay Min teased. Didn't the\nLord say never to underestimate a young\nman's potential? One day when the Lord\nrises to prominence, what will the four\ngreat families matter? Yes, pay men, you\ncome from a powerful and influential\nfamily. I believe what you say. The two\nlooked at each other and burst into\nlaughter. On another note, \"My lord,\ndon't you think that the two women\nbehind Miss Dugu are after me.\" Payman\nscratched his head ungracefully and\nsighed. \"Could it be that my luck with\nwomen is about to change, pay?\" \"One is\na valiant heroine, no less than Lord\nChin Leonu. The other is a tall,\nbeautiful woman of foreign origin.\" Ba\ncouldn't help but chuckle. Young Master\nPay has finally come to his senses. I\nthink they are indeed after you, but\nit's not a stroke of luck in love. What\nis that? I'm here to fight you. Hey,\nMina, huh? How did you find out, Lord?\nLynn Shia smiled faintly. Because you\ncan't hide the look in someone's eyes\nwhen they want to kill you. Watch out\nfor that woman with the prosthetic leg.\nShe&lt;unk&gt;ll beat you up sooner or later.\nAfter saying this, Lyn Sha embraced Ba\nand left, his voice carrying far away.\nGet some rest. Tomorrow's duel is up to\nyou. If you lose, your luck with romance\nwill be gone. Chapter 194. This is my\nhero, the sword saint. On this day,\ngongs and drums resounded and\nfirecrackers crackled. With yesterday's\ntriumphant start at the martial arts\narena, the people of Longshot Kingdom\nare extremely excited, high-spirited,\nand cheerful. Even their conversations\nhave become more optimistic. The first\nsmall victory in over a decade has\ncaused such a reaction from the people\nof Long Shia shows just how\nunsatisfactory Long Shia has been in\nrecent years. Don't get too cocky. The\nheroic arena has three parts. We won the\nfirst one, the soldier duel, but we only\ngot two points. Gene Wuang tried to\npersuade everyone to calm down. Even if\nwe win the duel and get three points, we\nstill can't get five points in the final\nduel against the Lord. The result is\nstill a draw in the heroic arena and\nwe'll have to play a tiebreaker. So\ndon't be too happy yet. I've seen it all\nbefore. Shut up, you old devil. A chief\nlord who is several hundred years old is\nnot as surprising as city lord Lin Shiao\nwho is not even 20 years old. You seeing\nthat no one appreciated his efforts, Jin\nWuang had no choice but to say, \"I have\nalso made some contributions to\nnurturing Lin Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s growth.\"\nEveryone was speechless. Lynn Shiao\ncouldn't help but feel ashamed when he\nsaw the chat content. He thought to\nhimself, \"Jean Wuang is sacrificing the\nlife of a worthless descendant, and the\noverall shooter is famous all over the\nworld.\" However, as the chief lord who\nwas like an old demon, Gene Wuang did\nnot use his power to oppress others, nor\ndid he retaliate against himself. He\ntruly had the demeanor of a senior\nmaster. Aside from that cackling\nlaughter and the powerless clone,\nshaking his head, Lynn Shia went to the\nrest area. All the lords participating\nin the competition have taken their\npositions accompanied by the heroes they\nare preparing to fight. Similar to the\nbattle, it starts with an elimination\ntournament. The main god system selects\npeople to engage in one-on-one duels,\nand the loser is eliminated. Unlike the\nbattle system, the lord cannot choose\nthe order of appearance. It is all\ndetermined by the main god system. After\nthe top 16 are determined by both sides\nor if one side has too many eliminated\nplayers and has fewer than eight heroes\nleft, the group stage will begin\ndirectly. The final battle ends when all\nheroes on one side are defeated or\nkilled. Heroes are not a unit type and\nit is difficult to replace them once\nthey are lost. Therefore, there is an\nadditional option for the lord to decide\nwhether to concede defeat for the hero.\nIn order to prevent the hero death rate\nfrom being as terrifying as that of\ncombat troops, aside from the lord\nsurrendering voluntarily, the only other\noptions are the hero dying in battle or\nthe god system determining that the hero\nhas lost all ability to resist and\nvoluntarily stopping the fight.\nNevertheless, in the past, nearly half\nof the duels on the martial arts arena\nstill resulted in a death rate because\nkilling an enemy and counter killing\noften happened in an instant and even\nlords could not react in time. In the\nrest area, Lyn Sha led Pay Min forward\nslowly, nodding to each lord. Boss, over\nhere, he waved excitedly and greeted Lin\nSha. Lyn Sha approached Hay and saw him.\nDing Li Shin Ningming Tu Shan by Chian\nand others boasting and competing with\neach other each leading their own\nheroes. Lyn Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s heart skipped a\nbeat. Is he a finally recruiting heroes\nafter his subordinates are all flower\nfairies? My lord. A sickeningly sweet\nvoice rang out and a green fairy pounced\ninto Lin Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s arms. Huh? Yao Yao,\nit's you. Of course, it's Yao Yao. Yao\nYao is a hero, too. Lynn Shiao\nexasperated pulled away the flower fairy\nsquad leader who was clinging to him\ntightly only to be groped by her along\nthe way. Yay! Yao Yao touched the lords.\nBefore the flower fairy could finish\nspeaking, he grabbed her and covered her\nmouth in horror. You can't just say\nthings like that. A low chuckle came\nfrom Pay Min behind him. Lynn Sha put\nhis hand to his forehead and said, \"He's\na after this arena match, I'll punish\nyou by making you give me another\nhundred flower fairies.\" The flower\nfairy captain's eyes lit up instantly.\nYao Yao is going to serve the Lord. Oh\ndear, please stop talking. He scooped up\nthe flower fairy captain and exclaimed,\n\"Boss, look at this beauty's heroine.\nShe's got some brand new stuff.\" Lyn Sha\nthen turned his head and saw Tu Shawn by\nChin's hero. Brother Lyn Shao, this is\nmy hero, the unforgiven master Yasuo.\nTuchan Bchin happily introduced her hero\nto Lyn Sha. Lyn Sha glanced at the young\nman with a high ponytail, a murderous\nlook on his face, a burly build, and a\nlong sword in his hand and nodded. Very\ngood. Looks very strong. He Thank you\nfor the compliment, brother Lynsha. This\nis a sword saint. You know, he's very\nstrong in one-on-one combat. This is a\nhero I carefully selected. Good snort.\nPay Min. The kid behind him suddenly let\nout a faint snort. Brother Shia, let me\nintroduce my hero to you as well.\nDinglay walked over. This is my hero. A\nreward I got from an epic chest. He's\nincredibly powerful. Dinglay said with a\nproud look. Sword Sainto.\nSamuru. Lin Shiao turned his head and\nsaw a tall, muscular, green-skinned orc\nhero with two long fangs standing next\nto Ding Lay. The hero immediately bowed\ndeeply to Lin Sha to show his respect.\n\"This face looks so familiar.\" \"Locktar\nogre?\" Lyn Sha asked tentatively.\nUnexpectedly, Samuru&lt;unk&gt;s eyes lit up\nupon hearing this. Great Earth goddess,\neven the Lord understands the ancient\norc language. Please allow me to serve\nmy Lord as I would a lord. Don't worry\nabout it. I saw this in an ancient book.\nJust follow the Lord and do a good job.\nI'll reward you if you do well. Lyn\nXiao&lt;unk&gt;s casual remark almost poached\nDing Lays hero, leaving Ding Lay with a\nresentful expression. Brother Shiao,\nwhen will you teach me the ancient orc\nlanguage? I'd like to increase my hero\nloyalty. I'll definitely do it next\ntime. Your loyalty as a sword saint is\nquite high. Lynn Sha chuckled. I'll\ndefinitely do it next time. Snort.\nAnother cold snort came from behind. It\nwas that kid Pay Min again. What's wrong\nwith this kid today? Just as Lin Sha was\nabout to turn around and asked Pay Min.\nTwo tall figures walked over. Dugu Jalon\nsaid from afar, student Lynn, \"It's\nquite lively here. Are you having a\npre-show competition between your\nheroes? Count me in.\" Dugu Jalon walked\nin front, followed by the tall\nred-haired woman who wore a half-g gold\nmask and had a golden prosthetic limb.\nThe woman revealed half of her face and\nsnow white chin. Her cloak barely\ntrailed on the ground. She had a slender\nfigure, a mysterious aura, and an air of\narrogance that seemed even more hottie\nthan Dugu Jaolon. Let me introduce you.\nThis is Marlenia, who has some unique\ninsights into swordsmanship. She really\nwants to spar with a true master\nswordsman. She's heard there's a sword\nsaint here. Dug Jalon said calmly. Would\nyou mind if she sparred with that sword\nsaint? Yasuo and Yuro s gazes suddenly\nmet, sparking a connection. Dinglay and\nTu Shan by Chin exchanged a glance and\nshouted, \"My hero is the sword saint.\"\nLyn Shiao glanced helplessly at Dugu\nXaolon and shrugged. \"Class monitor,\nyou're joking again.\" The two looked at\neach other and smiled. Snort. Pay Min\nlet out another soft, cold snort, which\ncaught Marlinia's attention. The\nredhaired woman was about to walk\ntowards Pay Min. Chu Yusi's voice rang\nout. On your marks. 5 minutes until the\nduel begins. Chapter 195. Why does no\none say Lin Xiao's hero is very strong.\nThe duel begins. In the live stream room\nset up by the God system, hundreds of\nmillions of viewers flocked in. Both\nteams players were in the rest area\npreparing their heroes while the chatter\nin the live stream room had already\nstarted. Yesterday's victory put\neveryone in high spirits and people\nstarted chatting more. Do you think we\ncan win this duel? I think we should be\nable to win. Although Lia's national\nstrength is not as good as Japan's, it\nhas a large population and many\noutstanding heroes. Heroes have always\nbeen one of the strengths of my dragon\nkingdom. I think it's feasible. So\neveryone, who do you think are the\nstrongest heroes among our group of\nyoung players from Lia? Once the topic\nwas brought up, everyone offered their\nopinions. I think first of all, the two\nchampions from last year and this year\nare very strong heroes. Someone said,\n\"All I know is that last year's hero was\nGandalf, a rare magic type hero.\" Yes, I\nhad the privilege of witnessing it once\nlast year. It was indeed very strong, at\nleast at the epic level or above. Yes.\nAnd there's also this year's number one,\nDugu Jalon. Although I don't know who\nher hero is, you can see it, too. The\nman reminded everyone. Look at the woman\nnext to Dugu Jaolon. She's the hero\nshe's fighting this time. Just looking\nat her posture, she looks really\npowerful. Dingle. This kid's hero is a\nhalf orc wielding such a long sword. He\nmust be very strong. I just heard\nsomeone say it was a sword saint. That's\nquite a name. I think the heroes of\nJulie are pretty good too. Chufing Olaf,\nthe leader of the Berserkers, is an epic\nhero. Wongbo looks very strong, too.\nChandosian. Amid the discussion, a voice\nasked, \"Why doesn't anyone say that Lyn\nXiao&lt;unk&gt;s hero is very strong?\" There\nwas a moment of silence in the live\nstream. Then everyone burst into\nlaughter. Haha. The man puzzled asked,\n\"Why are you laughing?\" Someone\nresponded, \"You mean Lyn Xiao's hero in\nwhite? Is there even a question? It has\nto be the strongest. That's right.\nAnyone who's paid even a little\nattention to Lyn Xiao's exploits in the\nnewbie zone probably knows him.\" The man\nwas puzzled. I'm from the Long Bay\nregion. I haven't paid attention to this\nbefore. Can you tell me about it? Back\nwhen Ding Lay was Lin Xiao's rival, he\nonce single-handedly defeated three top\nmasters. King Bo of Joli Pans Sha Yu and\nLyn Xiao's whiteclad hero. In the live\nstream, someone vividly described that\nhero in white defeated Dinglay with just\none sword strike. Also, when the black\nflame army attacked Lyn Shiao, did you\nknow who the heroes he led were? The\nultimate sword saint. That Wuji sword\nsaint is also a renowned one-on-one hero\nin the official server, having slain\nhundreds of heroes. He is one of the\nmost capable assassins of the terrifying\norganization, the Celestials. But even\nthe sword saint of Limitless was killed\nby Lin Xiao's whiteclad hero with his\nmost proficient killing move. Wow,\nthat's strong. And another thing, have\nyou ever seen Lin Shiao use that flowing\nStarfall sword technique? That whiteclad\nhero can do it, too. And he's even\nstronger. And also, I heard that the\ndemon Brans from the abyss was brutally\nbeaten up by the whiteclad hero. The\ncrowd chimed in, each adding their own\ndetails about the whiteclad hero's\nglorious exploits, leaving those who had\nnever witnessed such a spectacle filled\nwith longing. We are so excited about\nthis duel because we have already\nconsidered the hero in white as one of\nthe champion candidates. Everyone\nunderstood. But then someone asked, \"If\nour heroes are so powerful, don't the\nJapanese have any powerful heroes? If\nour strongest hero encounters the\nstrongest hero from Japan right at the\nstart of the elimination rounds,\nwouldn't we be eliminated immediately?\nEveryone paused for a moment. Even if\nthey were optimistic about the situation\non Lord Long Lia's side, they would not\nthink that the heroes on the Japanese\nside were weak. After all, Japan is a\nlongestablished power that can easily\nfield six legendary gold units and\ndozens of epic units in its combat\nsystem. I do have some insights into\nyour question. Gene Wuang reappeared\nmysteriously. All the battles are\narranged by the god system and the god\nsystem will make distinctions to avoid\nthe strongest heroes meeting at the\nbeginning. In the knockout stage, the\ngenerals selected by the main god can\nonly be one of two kinds. First, a duel\nbetween two relatively weak heroes.\nSecondly, we will assign powerful heroes\nto weak heroes, thus allowing the\npowerful heroes to advance smoothly.\nOnly in this way can we have the\nexciting round of 16 matches that\nfollow. Those powerful heroes can also\nbe called seed heroes. Gene Wuang's\npatient explanations paid off, and\neveryone finally understood that the god\nsystem had taken this into consideration\nlong ago. That's good, too. So, we can\nsee these truly powerful heroes go\nfurther and compete with equally matched\nopponents. Pay Min, who was secretly\nwatching the live stream chat, was\noverjoyed. Although he maintained a calm\nand collected demeanor, befitting a\nreclusive master, the slight upturn of\nhis lips betrayed his smuggness. \"All\nright, enough showing off. Look, you\nhaven't even played yet, and everyone\nalready thinks you're one of the\nstrongest heroes.\" Lyn Shao joked. Huh?\nKids martial arts skills are truly\noutstanding. This time I will surely\nmake a name for myself and bring glory\nto my ancestors. Pay Min glanced at Lyn\nSha again. And you still want to spread\nthe fame of my lord. All right. All\nright. It's your turn. Yes, my lord.\nI'll keep showing off when I get back.\nWith a flash of light, Lin Shia and Pay\nMin entered the battle arena. At the\nsame time, nine other Dragia lords also\nentered the battlefield to fight against\nthe Japanese lords. The knockout stage\nhas officially begun. Everyone stopped\ntheir discussion and watched intently as\n10 simultaneous hero battles unfolded.\nLook, it's a his hero is a flower fairy.\nI've never heard of the flower fairy\nhero. And the pretty girl was also taken\nadvantage of. Her champion was Yasuo,\nthe unforgiven. Look, they're about to\nstart fighting. Look at Len Sha. The\nhero in white has arrived. The hero in\nwhite moved. Huh? Why isn't the enemy\nhero reacting? The Japanese hero is\ndead. Did the hero in white win? Lyn\nShia and the hero in white have been\nteleported out. That's way too fast.\nReally? Really? It's over before I even\nstarted watching. Everyone was taken\naback and quickly looked for the hero in\nwhite. With a flash of light, Lin Sha\nand Pay Min returned to the rest area.\nPay Min maintained the posture from when\nhe drew his sword, slowly sheathing it.\nHis handsome and upright face gradually\napproached the blade and he gently\nexhaled. Payman gently blew a drop of\nblood off the sword. The live stream was\nquiet for a moment then. Holy crap,\nthat's awesome. Damn, that's so cool.\nThe hero in white is so cool. The speed,\nthe aura, the melancholy after killing\nand the way he blows away the blood. Lyn\nSha is awesome. The hero in white is\nawesome. Chapter 196 sword saint. It's\nthe sword saint again. Payman's face\nturned pale. Across from them in the\nJapanese rest area, Yamamoto Isuroku\nalso looked astonished. He knew Lin\nShiao was very strong. Lyn Xiao&lt;unk&gt;s\nwhiteclad hero was very strong.\nTheoretically speaking, the god system\nwill definitely arrange for Lin Sha to\nfight against the weaker lord on its\nside. Therefore, he instructed his men\nthat if they encountered Lin Shiao and\nthe white-clad hero, they did not need\nto defeat them. They only needed to\ndefend themselves and hold out for a\nwhile before admitting defeat. Yamamoto\nIsuroka's idea was to avoid losing any\nheroes just to buy some time so that his\nside could figure out the whiteclad hero\nsword techniques and have more ways to\ndeal with them. But to their surprise,\nwith a flash of sword light, their own\nexceptional level hero was killed on the\nspot before he could even take two\nsteps. How could it be so fast? How did\nLyn Shiao managed to recruit such a\nterrifying hero? Yamamoto Isuroku was\nfurious. Lyn Shao instantly killed his\nown lord at the start of the battle,\nwhich had a significant impact on both\nsides. The morale of the Japanese\nplummeted once again, while the morale\nof Lshia soared instantly. Even the\nother dragon sia heroes who were\nfighting were encouraged and fought each\nother recklessly with the weak Japanese\nlord Sakura Shichiro Toy Jinichiro\nTokugawa Hiyato. When you go on stage\nlater, you must deliver a fatal blow and\nannihilate their heroes of the dragon\nkingdom showing the might of our eastern\nJapan. or else you can commit sepukuku\nbaka. In contrast to Yamamoto Isuroku's\nfury, Riawa was in a state of ecstasy.\nShouts of Lin Sha is mighty and the\nwhiteclad hero is mighty echoed one\nafter another. Payman's lips were\npractically trembling with rage. But in\norder to maintain his composure as a\nmaster, he had to force himself to hold\nit in, making Lin Sha want to shake his\nhead in disbelief. Before long, one lord\nafter another, along with their heroes,\nwere teleported back by the god system.\nMy lord, your hero was so cool. Just\nnow, a sweet cloying voice rang out. It\nwas he and his flower fairy captain who\nhad returned. The two ran over\nexcitedly, and the flower fairy captain\nlunged at Pay Min, only to be grabbed\nand thrown away by Lin Shia. Be more\nreserved, Yao Yao. Yao Yao also wants to\ntouch this hero's abs. Before he could\nfinish speaking, Heay covered the flower\nfair's mouth again. Young Master Pi,\nplease don't mind her. That's just how\nflower fairies are. He boss, you didn't\nexpect me to win, did you? I thought Yao\nYao, who relied entirely on talking and\nself-destruction, would definitely be\nreincarnated this time. He said happily.\nI never expected the poison the Lord\nbestowed upon me to be so effective. Yao\nYao s skills are getting stronger and\nstronger. She can release poison while\nrunning around the battlefield and\nactually poison the sumo wrestler\nYokozuna hero to death. It's hilarious.\nSo it was Xiaoir's famous poison again.\nLyn Shao realized a flash of light\nappeared and soon Ding Lay and Tu Shan\nby Chin also came out both with smiles\non their faces. My sword saint easily\ndefeated the Japanese samurai on the\nother side. Dinglay said proudly. In\njust one minute, a four times damage\ncritical hit killed the enemy on the\nspot. Misaro is really too strong. Mine\nis the true master. My Yasuo killed the\nenemy champion in just one minute. The\nenemy champions couldn't even touch the\nhem of Yasuo&lt;unk&gt;'s clothes. Yasuo is\ntruly powerful. Yasuo is the true\nmaster. E L Lin Sha looked at the two\nmen who were on the verge of exchanging\nblows and couldn't help but shake his\nhead. What are you two arguing about?\nDing Li and Tu Shan by Chin said in\nunison, \"We'll compete for the title of\nsword saint.\" Behind him, Pay Min, who\nhad been quite pleased, let out another\ncold snort. Lyn Sha was amused. It\nturned out that Pay Min was unhappy\nbecause someone called himself the sword\nsaint in front of him. This kid has\nquite a bit of vanity. \"All right, stop\narguing,\" Lyn Sha said, stopping the\ntwo. \"In my opinion, it's better to let\nstrength decide the outcome. How about\nwe name the one who fights to the very\nend the sword saint?\" Dingle and Tu Shan\nby Chin also thought this was a good\nidea. At this moment, Dugu Jaolon, who\nhad also returned from the battlefield,\npassed by. She was with Marlenia and\nseemingly eager to stir up trouble,\ncasually asked. Which hero is the sword\nsaint? Mine is. Mine is the one, the two\nof them said in unison. Lyn Sha could\nonly glance helplessly at the\ntroublemaking Dugu Jaolon, who secretly\nwinked at him. Oh my, my lord. This\nnoble woman seems to have feelings for\nyou. Pay joked. You're one step closer\nto marrying into a wealthy family, Lord.\nLyn Sha withdrew his hand and said\ncalmly, \"The class monitor has always\nbeen like this. Only those who know her\nwell know that she is cold on the\noutside but warm on the inside and likes\nto cause trouble. This is just a genuine\nexpression of affection between old\nfriends. Don't over interpret it. Making\ntrouble?\" Pay Min's eyes lit up. Ugg\nsmack. Lyn Sha suddenly realized what\nwas happening. Turned around and got\nanother sharp wrap on the head. I think\nyou haven't had enough of being beaten\nyet. Dingle and Tan by Chian exchanged a\nglance, shook their heads, and left.\nTheir voices drifted from afar. No\nmatter who wins the title of sword saint\nin the end, I don't think it will be the\nwhiteclad hero, will it? H what kind of\nsword saint has such a foul mouth? And\nhe gets beaten up by the lord all the\ntime. In the first round of 10 knockout\nmatches, Long Sha won eight. Even in the\ntwo matches he lost, Lia conceded defeat\nin time, saving the hero. If things\ncontinue like this, the dawn of victory\nseems to be just around the corner. Lin\nShiao, Dugu, Jaolon, Dinglay, and Tuchan\nBaian all won with overwhelming\nadvantages. It seems that they are the\nexperts judged by the main god system,\nand they have been matched with weak\nopponents to ensure their advancement.\nEay also wore down his opponent, which\nwas just a case of two weaklings\nfighting, and he won entirely by being\nshameless. After a short break, the\nsecond round of the knockout stage\nbegan. Soon, the Lang Shia group's\ninitial joy turned to disappointment. In\nthe second match, a master from Japan\nmakes his appearance. Sakura Shichiro s\nMiiamoto Mousashi instantly killed Lia's\nhero within the first 30 seconds of the\ngame. Honda Tatakatu of Tokugawa Hayato\nknocked down Ryu Natsu Hiro within the\nfirst minute of the game. While Ryunatsu\nLord was performing a cool but useless\nexecution move, he slammed his fist on\nthe ground to admit defeat and escaped\nwith his life. Roland's hero was\nfar-flying Sasuke, who defeated the\nDragon Summer Hero in less than 2\nminutes. The dragon summer lord promptly\nconceded defeat, but upon returning to\nthe rest area, he succumbed to the\npoison and died within 3 seconds beyond\nthe help of the team doctor. One after\nanother, heroes of dragon summer were\ndefeated. In the second match, only\nChufinga's Olaf and Lind Douching\nGandalf won. Lia, eight losses and two\nwins. The advantage has been completely\nwiped out. After everyone calmed down,\nthe third elimination round began. In\nthe third match, the true strength of\nthe Eastern Kingdom was revealed. In\naddition to Julie's victory, even Wong\nBo lost the match. Lia won four and lost\nsix. As the competition progressed, Lia\nKingdom lost more often than it won. In\nthe final elimination match, Toyottomy\nJinichiro, known as the greatest genius\nin Japan, made his reappearance. Lords\nof the Dragia Kingdom, I am honored to\nintroduce you. Toy Jinichiro raised his\nhead and declared, \"This is the\nstrongest one-on-one hero of my great\nEastern Empire. Sword Saint Ishan Ashina\nchapter 197 Terrifying Strength and the\nRiddler Lin Sha Sword Saint Ishan\nAshina. Holy crap. Wow. Holy crap.\nThree. Holy crap.\" S rang out\nsimultaneously from Ding Lay. Tu Shan by\nChin and Pay Min. The first two thought\nto themselves, why is someone calling me\nsword saint again? While Pay Min was\nsimply annoyed once more, \"The sword\nsaint, it's the sword saint again. Is\nthe nickname sword saint like cabbage?\nSomething you can just buy anywhere at\nthe market?\" On the other side, Asha is\nmatched against Garen, a two-handed\nswordsman led by Lord Hiroshi of Dragon\nStreet. Damn it, why was my hero matched\nwith Ishin Ashina? Ishin Ashina can't be\na noob. So, does that mean my hero is a\nnoob? Guanghuan muttered to himself.\nThen I've been used by the god system as\na stepping stone for Toyottomy\nJennyurro. No way. My Garin is\ndefinitely not a stepping stone. With\nsuch powerful defensive capabilities,\neven if we can't defeat Ishina, we can't\nlet the enemy win easily. Garen, go for\nit. Give it your all. Don't worry about\nwinning. Just hold on for 2 minutes,\nthen we'll concede. Yes, sir. The tall\nman, Garin, wearing thick armor,\nimmediately responded. The battle\nbegins. Courage. Garin immediately\nactivated his shield to increase his\ndefense while simultaneously gripping\nhis greatsword with both hands and\nassuming a fighting stance. Opposite\nthem, a samurai dressed in traditional\nJapanese armor, holding a long sword,\nslowly walked over. weak, too weak.\nIshin Asha didn't even want to look\ndirectly at Garen, who was giving it his\nall, and simply raised his head\nslightly, pointing his chin at him. I\nusually only kill experts. I'll give you\none chance. Just admit defeat. If you\ndon't give up in 3 seconds, I'll end\nthis. Damn it. You look down on me like\nthis before the fight has even started.\nGarren shouted. I am one of the\nstrongest shields. How can I admit\ndefeat without even drawing my sword?\nTake this, Ishinina. Charge. Garin's\ngreat sword suddenly gathered energy and\nhis armor emitted a faint glow. He\nroared and ignoring Hiatoshi's command,\ncharged directly at Asha. A fatal blow.\nGarin leaped high into the air, charging\ntowards the warrior before him with the\nforce of a thunderbolt. Oymph. You want\nto defend. You want to attack. You want\nto fight, but you don't want to fight.\nYour heart is full of hesitation. Asha\nIshin slowly placed his hand on the\nscabbard, assuming a Japanese\nswordsmanship starting stance. He\nremained calm and composed, his gaze\nsilently fixed on the distance. If your\nheart is filled with hesitation, your\nstrength will be scattered. Just as\nGarin's great sword was about to fall on\nIshin Asha's head, one word slash double\ncombo. A flash of light appeared as\nIshin Ashina appeared behind Garen. His\nposture remained unchanged, but his\nkatana was already drawn. There was\nblood on the knife. Ishin Ashina Garin\nswayed and then fell heavily to the\nground. The battle is over. The god\nsystem immediately executed the\nteleportation and the screen switched\naccordingly. Out of the corner of\neveryone's eye, it seemed that Garin's\nfall on the battlefield had broken him\ninto three pieces. H. The Japanese\nswordsman is terrifyingly powerful. Tank\nheroes known for their defense are\nnothing more than a single blow in front\nof him. The entire room fell silent. In\nthe rest area, the expressions of all\nthe dragon lords also became serious.\nThis guy is pretty strong. Chu Yusi\nsighed. I've long heard that a sword\nsaint hero has emerged from the new\ngeneration of Japan and he's incredibly\npowerful. I thought it was just some\nboastful person giving themselves the\ntitle of hero. This sword saint lives up\nto his reputation. My sword saint is no\nweakling either and my sword saint will\ndefinitely not lose to Ishinina Dinglay\nand Tu Shan by Chian immediately\nreplied. Very good. You have this\nunwavering confidence in victory. That's\nthe mindset of becoming a strong person.\nKeep it up. You might encounter Ishinina\nin the next round. Chu Yui nodded an\naffirmation. Turning his head again, Chu\nYui saw Lin Shiao and his white-clad\nhero, both of whom had strange\nexpressions. The hero in white looked\nsolemn, while Lyn Sha looked like he was\nquestioning the meaning of life. Lyn\nSha, what do you think? I've only ever\nseen the elderly and the middle-aged\nwith one mind. This is the first time\nI've seen the young with one mind, Lyn\nSha said seemingly to himself. Chui\nwhat? Oh, it's nothing. I think it's\nvery strong. Shu Yusi looked suspicious.\nLynn Sha glanced at Pay Min. Pay Min,\nwhat do you think? This sword strike was\nexecuted with effortless ease,\ndemonstrating a profound mastery of the\nsword. Pay Min abandoned his nonchalant\nattitude and expression and answered\nseriously. I have never seen such a\nmaster swordsman in my life. He will be\na formidable opponent. Pay men with\nslight surprise. It's rare for you to\nhave such a high opinion of someone who\nuses a sword. Then Lyn Sha added with a\nsigh, but I think he might use other\nthings, too. What? Lin Shiao simply\nsaid, \"It's nothing. Let's continue\nwatching his match. It's a pity that\nmany of our heroes can't even force him\nto use his second move.\" Seeing that Lyn\nXiao&lt;unk&gt;s answer was irrelevant, Pay\nMin looked displeased and whispered,\n\"Oh, riddle tellers are so annoying. I\nthink so, too.\" Chu Yusi nodded in\nagreement. Soon the first round of the\nknockout stage was over. Since there are\nstill over 60 players present, two more\nrounds of elimination matches must be\nplayed to determine the top 16. However,\nno one knows for sure how many of the\ntop 16 are from Japan and how many are\nfrom China. On the Dangia kingdom side,\nthe two sword saints are very strong.\nGandalf is very strong. The female hero\nDugajolon is very strong. And the\nwhiteclad hero is also very strong. But\nIshin Ashina is too strong. The\nwhiteclad hero instantly killed an\nunknown low-quality hero with a single\nsword strike. But Asha Ishin was the one\nwho killed Hiatoshi's epic quality\ndefensive hero, Garen. The two are not\ncomparable. The difference is clear to\neveryone. Soon the second round of\nbattle began. On Lshia's side, Hizay,\nwho won, was once again selected to\nparticipate in the battle. This time, he\nwasn't so lucky, and he ran straight\ninto Miyamoto Mousashi, becoming a\nstepping stone for the seated player.\nThe flower fairy captain didn't even\nhave time to scream or unleash her\nself-destruction before she was stabbed\nto death. \"All right, all right, at\nleast we've completed the task and made\nit to the second round.\" He consoled\nhimself. At least I'm just a skilled\nhero and I still managed to splatter\nblood all over that ninja's face. I feel\nlike there's something off about your\nheroes and unit types. Shu Yusi had\nintended to offer Heiz some words of\ncomfort, but seeing he's state, he\nbecame somewhat doubtful instead. They'd\nreally self-destruct just to touch her\nboss's abs. How would they touch them\nafter that? He chuckled awkwardly and\nsaid, \"Nonsense.\" Chu Yuzi still looked\nat he suspiciously. After a long while,\nhe turned and left, muttering to\nhimself. They're all riddle tellers and\nthat crazy flower fairy. It's like\nthey've joined a cult. Maybe I should\ninvestigate Lin Shiao and his group\nanother day. Now it was Lyn Xiao's turn\nto take the stage again. Chapter 198.\nSword Saint duel Yasuo versus Ishin\nAshina. Look everyone, Lyn Xiao's\nwhiteclad hero is on stage. Can the hero\nin white replicate his feat of instantly\ndefeating the Japanese hero with a\nsingle sword strike in the previous\nround? Is the whiteclad hero stronger or\nis Ashina Ishin stronger? Both are\nskilled swordsmen. Will they fight each\nother? Amidst the discussion and\nanticipation, a flash of white light\nappeared and pay men materialized. He\nslowly drew his long sword, his\nexpression serious, and walked toward\nthe Japanese hero. Go my hero. The\nJapanese lord shouted. You can't kill my\nJimmy Kamehameha Ichiro in an instant.\nHe's a master of the Kamehameha\ntechnique. Pay didn't reply, nor did he\ninstantly defeat the Japanese hero as he\nhad done in the previous match. He\nsimply held his long sword diagonally in\none hand and walked forward step by\nstep. Genmi Kamiya Ichiro holding a\nshield in one hand and a sword in the\nother met bay men. Absolute defense.\nJenme Kamiya Ichiro instantly became\ncovered in a ring of hard solid stones\nas armor and he picked up his sword to\nslash at Bay Min. Pay Min calmly parried\nthe attack with his sword and then\nthrust out a sword to test the waters.\nThe two exchanged blows and surprisingly\nthey were evenly matched. The whiteclad\nhero isn't as strong as I imagined.\nFortunately, Jimmy Kamiya Ichiro should\nbe able to hold on. Maybe we can still\nwin. The excitement and surprise of the\nLord of the East were visible to\neveryone in the live stream. What's with\nLyn Xiao's whiteclad hero? Why didn't he\nkill this guy with a single sword\nstrike? That's right. The whiteclad hero\ncould instantly kill the opposing hero\nwith a single sword strike in the last\nmatch. So why couldn't he do it this\ntime? Was the opponent too strong? I've\nchecked this opponent. They're just a\nlowquality epic defensive hero.\ntheoretically a pushover or stepping\nstone against whiteclad heroes. What?\nThe whiteclad hero and this hero have\nbeen fighting for several minutes and\nstill haven't decided the winner. Could\nit be that the title of hero in white is\nundeserved? Or is he simply exhausted?\nIshina can instantly kill epic Garen,\nbut the whiteclad hero cannot instantly\nkill epic jimmyi kamiya Ichiro. The\ndifference between the two is now clear.\nSigh. It seems hard to say who the\nnumber one hero really is. Skepticism.\nLynn Shiao could feel the disappointment\nsurging through the Dragon Sea Kingdoms\npeople, even through the screen. Pay Min\ndid not instantly defeat the Japanese\nhero. Instead, he used the simplest\nsword moves and sparred with the enemy\nhero with a serious expression. Lyn Sha\nlooked closely at Pay Min and saw that\nhe was serious, meticulous, and\ncompletely focused, seemingly unaffected\nby the outside world. He seemed to be\nadjusting his physical functions and\ncondition. Lyn Sha thought to himself,\n\"It seems that Asha Ishan s appearance\nhas indeed made Pay Min feel a sense of\nurgency.\" Having guessed Payman's\nthoughts, felt relieved. He didn't urge\nor give any instructions, but simply\nwatched quietly as Pay Min used Jinmi\nKmagayauro as a highle punching bag,\npracticing his moves and countering his\nattacks. You still underestimate the\nheroes in white. In the live stream,\nsome experts noticed Payman's condition,\nGene Wuang being one of them. Don't be\nfooled by his seemingly evenly matched\nfight with Jinmi Kamiro. The whiteclad\nhero has always maintained absolute\ndominance. Gene Wuang said, \"He is\nslowly entering a profound and\nmysterious realm.\" Old devil, you've\nsaid so much. So, what realm has he\nentered? I don't practice swordsmanship.\nI only occasionally sell swords. How\nwould I know what level he has reached?\nSo, what is your weapon? My weapon is a\nstaff, and I also make and sell staffs.\nWhen the sword seller and staff maker\nsaw Gene Wuang introducing himself in\nsuch a serious manner, Lin Shia almost\nspat out his water. This devil also has\nthe potential to be a comedian. On the\nbattlefield, the Japanese lords\ngradually notice something a miss. Damn\nit, have I been tricked? It seems Jinmai\nKamiya Ichiro can't beat this hero in\nwhite. But should I admit defeat? If I\nsurrender before even forcing the\nwhite-clad hero to use more sword\ntechniques, Lord Yamamoto might punish\nme. Why don't we hold on a little\nlonger? As the Japanese lord&lt;unk&gt;'s eyes\ndarted around, deep in thought, he saw\nPay Min slightly. That's about it. I've\nreviewed the basic sword techniques\nagain, and I should have made further\nprogress. Basic sword techniques? You've\nbeen fighting me with basic sword\ntechniques the whole time. The greatest\ntruths are the simplest. I must review\nthe lessons I've missed in order to\nreach my peak performance. Pay Min\nreplied calmly. Thank you for your\nsparring, but you're useless now. Jimmy\nKamiya Ichiro&lt;unk&gt;'s eyes. Was the\nwhiteclad hero about to unleash his\nultimate move? Is it that dazzling\nflowing technique? He roused himself and\nfocused his attention on defense only to\nsee Pay Min still attacking with basic\nsword techniques move by move.\nThankfully, it's just a basic sword.\nBefore the Japanese lord could even\nutter a sound, pay casually thrust his\nsword through a gap in Jinme Kamiya\nIchiro s defenses, piercing his body.\nJinmi Kamiya Ichiro is killed in action.\nThe battle is over. The hero in white\nhas won in 3 minutes and 45 seconds. The\nviewers in the live stream also noticed\nPay Min's victory. Defeating an epic\nlevel hero at this time should have been\na decent achievement, but the words were\nleft unsaid. But everyone understood\nwhat followed. This speed is still far\nfrom Ishinas. Lyn Sha and Pay Min\nteleported back at the same time. Seeing\nPay Min's high-spirited appearance, Lin\nSha nodded affirmatively. Keep up the\ngood work. The battle continued. After\nseveral matches where neither side\ngained an advantage, a series of clashes\nbetween weak opponents from Japan and\nLiao. Perhaps the words spoken earlier\ncame true for the next two to take the\nstage were none other than Tu Shawn by\nChien X Yasuo the swift sword saint and\nAshina Ishin. A duel between two sword\nsaints. The audience in the live stream\nwas immediately intrigued. Everyone, who\ndo you think will win? As expected, most\nviewers thought Ishin Asha would be the\nwinner. It must be said that Ishina's\nstunning sword strike gave everyone a\ngreat deal of shock. Yasuo, are we going\nto admit defeat? Suddenly summoned to\nthe battlefield, Tu Shawn by Chien felt\na sense of fear. Although I know you are\nstrong, the one on the other side seems\nto be even stronger. Just admit defeat\nand I will apologize to the city lord in\nperson. I don't want you to leave like\nthis. Tu Shan by Chin could finish\nspeaking. Yasua interrupted her. Death\nis like the wind, always by my side.\nYasuo slowly drew his long sword. his\nentire being as sharp and unshathed as a\nsword. Even if it means death, I will\nnot give up my duel with a master\nswordsman. My mind is made up. This is a\nswordsman's honor. Well said. Across\nfrom him, Ishin Ashina praised. He bowed\nsolemnly to Yasuo. I will grant you a\nglorious death. The two slowly\napproached each other like two cowboys\ndueling in the wilderness, facing off,\nwaiting for the moment to draw their\nguns and deliver a fatal blow to their\nopponent. The atmosphere grew\nincreasingly tense. Ishin Asha said\nslowly, \"Your lord has become hesitant\nand you desire a battle. Your hearts are\nnot together which has already caused\nyou to hesitate. So what if I hesitate?\nMy fate is in my own hands, not in the\nheavens.\" Their eyes met and sparks flew\nin the air. Take this, the two shouted\nat the same time. A flash of sword\nlight. Ishin Ashina sheathed his sword.\nHe hesitating. Hesitation leads to\ndefeat. Chapter 199. The stunning\nValkyrie. Yasua lost. Moreover, he was\nkilled by Ishin Ashina with a single\nsword strike. Even a powerful swordsman\nlike Yasuo the unforgiven was merely a\nvictim of Ishin Asha's sword. This is a\ntop tier swordsman among epic level\nmasters. When the whiteclad hero killed\nthe supreme sword saint, it took him\nquite a bit of effort. But this asha is\nthe people of Lshia kingdom could no\nlonger sit still. Anxiety spread\nrapidly. Tan by Chin teleported back and\nshe seemed very disappointed. Don't be\nsad, beautiful girl. It's not that Yasuo\nisn't strong, it's just that the\nopponent is too strong. Eay stepped\nforward to comfort him. If only Yasuo\ncould be resurrected like your flower\nfairy. Tuan by Chian was still in a low\nvoice. She shook her head and looked at\nDinglay. It seems that the title of\nsword saint will have to be reclaimed by\nyour hero. We will definitely go all\nout. Witnessing Ishin Ashina as\nstrength, Ding Lay was no longer so\nconfident. Misaro told me that if he\nwere to face Isha Nashina, even if he\nwere to die in battle, he would die with\nthe same dignity as Yasuo. If Misaro\ncan't do it either, maybe only Shiaolu\nand his group have a chance to defeat\nAshaishin. The group nodded solemnly,\nlooking at Lin Sha, who was deep in\nthought, staring at the large screen in\nthe distance. That person was their last\nhope. The second round of elimination\nmatches ended quickly. As expected, Lang\nShia Kingdom lost more than it won. The\nthird round of elimination matches has\nbegun. A flash of light and Lin Sha and\nPay Min were the first to appear. This\nrekindled the interest of the\ndisappointed Lang Sha group. Lyn Sha is\nhere. The invincible hero in white has\narrived. Can he recreate the miracle of\nkilling the enemy with a single sword\nstrike and boost the morale of the\nDragon Xiao people? On the other side,\nthe chosen Japanese lord had an\nextremely complicated expression. It\nseems that the god system has determined\nme to be a stepping stone for the\nwhiteclad heroes. This Japanese hero was\nsensible, but he did not back down. We\nJapanese do not retreat without a fight.\nLet my hero see just how capable this\nwhiteclad hero really is. Turo, brother,\ncharge. On the other side, a small giant\nwhose muscles looked like they were\nabout to explode charged over. Pay Min\nwith his long sword clasped around his\narm calmly approached. The battle\nproceeded methodically and steadily. Pay\nMin and Hu Yulu's younger brother fought\na fierce battle with neither side\ngaining a clear advantage. The hero in\nwhite is still evenly matched with the\nJapanese hero. The disappointment on\neveryone's faces was palpable. After a\nfew minutes of fighting, Tiguru's\nyounger brother made a careless move.\nAnd the white-clad hero seized the\nopportunity, suddenly stabbing him in\nthe eye with a sword that pierced his\nbrain, ending the battle. Damn it, we\nwere so close. In the Japanese quarter,\nYamamoto Isuroku angrily slammed his\nfist on the floor. He was so close.\nTiguro sand could have taken down that\nhero in white. If only he hadn't run out\nof energy. After hurling a few angry\ncurses, Yamamoto Isurokroa suddenly\nlaughed. He turned to look at Toyottomy\nJinichiurro who was watching the battle\nwith him and said, \"You say the\nwhiteclad hero is a formidable opponent,\nbut in my opinion, he is far inferior to\nyour Asha Ishin. Asha is always wins\nwith a single blow, a crushing victory.\nBut this white-clad hero who is only\nconsidered a mid-level hero here will\ntake several minutes to defeat him.\nToyottomi Jinichiro smiled reservedly\nand said, \"This is the difference in\nfoundation, sir. A swordsman can kill\nanyone who is weak, but when he\nencounters a strong enough enemy, his\ntrue skill will be revealed. Rest\nassured, my lord, Japan will surely win\nthis duel.\" Yoshi Yamamoto Isuroku burst\ninto laughter. The battle continued and\nDing Lays swordsman Misaro encountered\nan epic hero from Japan. After a few\nminutes of fierce fighting, he\nsuccessfully killed the enemy.\nShendawwan's Gandalf also used\nlong-range magic to blast away the\nJapanese knights on the other side.\nChufinga Olaf was first brutally beaten\nby the Japanese samurai, then went\nberserk and despite being seriously\ninjured, killed the enemy hero. And\nthese were just a handful of narrow\nvictories and pirick wins for the dragon\nsa kingdom. Lia was completely\noutmatched in the game. At that moment a\nflash of light appeared and a peerless\nfigure entered the battlefield. Dug\nJalon. Even those who were disheartened\nby long sa's series of defeats were\nintrigued by the sight of such a\nstunning beauty. They temporarily put\naside their discussion and watched the\nlive stream carefully. In the scene,\nDugu Jalon is dressed in a light purple\nrobe with a sword at her waist, looking\nethereal and aloof. Her long hair\ncascaded down. Her beautiful eyes were\nclear as water. Her purple dress was as\nsword was as white as snow. She was\nand extraordinary. This is the number\none player in the Lone Non newbie zone\nthis year, someone exclaimed. A being\ncapable of overpowering Lynn, Sha must\nbe incredibly strong, right? Her hero,\nMelia, is just as charismatic. On the\nbattlefield, a tall redhaired woman\nstood proudly alone, wearing golden\narmor and a scarlet cloak behind her.\nShe wore a golden winged helmet, the\nmask of which covered half of her face,\nrevealing only her fair, flawless lower\nhalf, and bright but aloof red lips. Her\nright hand was a prosthetic arm made of\ngolden armor with a long narrow sword\nattached to one end. This look made\neveryone slow their breathing and\ncouldn't help but take a few more\nglances. I didn't pay attention in the\nprevious battles, but Marenia looks\nreally cool in her armor this time. By\nthe way, how did Dugu Jaon's heroes\nperform in the previous battles? We won\neasily, but our opponents were all\nweaklings. This is the chance to test\nthis heroine's strength because the one\ntaking the stage is Sakura Shichiro\nMiiamoto Mousashi. Everyone was then\nsurprised to realize that they had been\nso focused on admiring Dugu Jaolon's\nbeauty and her hero's charisma that they\nhadn't noticed that Sakura Shichiro,\nwhose face was contorted with rage and\nhis hero Miiamoto Mousashi were their\nopponents in this battle. Damn it,\naren't I a seated player? Why were I\nmatched with Dugu Jaon? Am I the\nstepping stone or is Dugu Jalaon the\nstepping stone? Sakura Shichiro&lt;unk&gt;'s\nexpression twisted and one thought after\nanother surfaced in his mind. I am a\ngenius from the Shikoku Islands region\nof Japan and my hero is also a legendary\ngolden hero. I must be a master. Dugu\nJalon on the other side is the number\none in the LN region. So her strength\nmust be considerable as well. But\naccording to the logic of the main god\nsystem, I should be fighting a complete\nnoob right now like he's a then if we\nthink about it the other way around,\nlonely Garin should just be fighting\nagainst one of our outstanding level\nlords. But the god arranged for me to\nface off against Dugu Jaon. According to\nthe god system, one of us, Dugu Jaolon,\nmust be a fake expert. That's why we\nwere judged to fight each other. So who\nexactly was sacrificed? who was the\nstepping stone for the seated players. H\nbaka Sakura Shichiro roared and\nimmediately ordered Miiamoto Mousashi to\nlaunch an attack. The legendary ninja\ninstantly turned into a cloud of smoke\nand vanished from the battlefield. Dugu\nXaolon, \"Your heroism is nothing but a\nfacade, a stepping stone.\" Sakura\nShichiro shouted. She's about to be\nkilled by Miyamoto Mousashi. Chapter\n200. The legendary five levels 16\nemerge. Oh, is that so? Dugu Jaolon\nresponded to Miiamoto Mousashi with a\nsingle sentence, then fell silent,\ncalmly watching the battlefield. Damn\nit, this condescending attitude and\narrogant demeanor are just too rude.\nSakura Shichiro was so angry his nose\nalmost twisted. I'll make you understand\nhow powerful I am. In the live stream,\neveryone was puzzled by the arrangement\nof this match. Isn't Miiamoto Mousashi a\ntop seed? His last match was against\nHeay's Flower Fairy. It was obvious that\nthey were just letting him advance to\nthe top 16. How come he's now facing two\ntop fighters, Marlinia and Marinia, at\nthe same time? That's right. I remember\nMiiamoto Mousashi is a legendary hero.\nThere are only five of them in the\nentire East Japan region. Is the main\ngod system malfunctioning? Yeah, it's a\nbattle between legends. Isn't that a\nclash of titans? Gene Wuang then spoke\nup. Indeed, there are only two\npossibilities in the knockout stage.\nWeak against weak and strong against\nweak. But the strength or weakness here\nis relative. For a hero with an S-rank\ntalent skill or a combat power rating of\n10,000 stars, an enemy with an A- rank\ntalent of 5,000 stars is a weakling. So\nyou understand now, right? If the god\nsystem determines that the difference in\nstrength between the two sides is too\ngreat and one side has almost no chance\nto challenge the other, then they will\nbe placed in the same elimination route.\nI see. Everyone nodded. It felt quite\ngood to have a knowledgeable old devil\nchief lord by their side. No wonder\nSakura Shichiro&lt;unk&gt;'s expression was so\nstrange just now. He was also wondering\nwho the weakling was. As everyone was\ntalking, the battle officially began.\nWith a flash of smoke, Miyamoto Mousashi\nsuddenly appeared silently behind\nMarlene, wielding a short Japanese sword\nin one hand and a shuriken in the other,\nattacking the heroine. The heroine\nremained standing motionless. \"Got it,\"\nSakura Shiro&lt;unk&gt;'s mind. \"Oh!\" a cold,\nmocking voice rang out. With a nimble\nturn, Marlinia easily dodged Miyamoto\nMousashi's sneak attack. I am Marlinia,\nthe Lord's Blade. Marlinia's lips curled\ninto a slight smile as she said calmly.\nYou can call me Valkyrie. Valkyrie, my\nfoot. You're nothing but a stepping\nstone for me to get into the top 16. I\nwill definitely kill you. Whoosh!\nMiamoto Mousashi's hands moved swiftly,\nthrowing darts, shuriken, and poison\nbullets one after another at the\nheroine. Marlenia was agile and kept\ndodging. Those dazzling array of hidden\nweapons and attacks couldn't even touch\nMarlinia's fluttering cloak. Marinia\nkept looking at the ninja opposite her\nwith a faint mocking gaze. Miiamoto\nMousashi's movements became faster and\nfaster, but the heroine's evasion was as\ngraceful and free as a leaf falling in a\nstrong wind. Everyone stared intently at\nthe battle scene. Is it a clash of\ntitans or an elimination tournament\nwhere the strong are weak? Between these\ntwo legendary heroes, who is stronger\nand who is weaker? Suddenly, Marinia\npaused, then made a lightning fast lunge\nto the side. First with a shoulder\nstrike, then with a backhand slash using\nher prosthetic right hand. The collision\nstruck Miiamoto Mousashi, who had\nsuddenly teleported to that location.\nThe ninja didn't even have time to react\nbefore his bones were broken. Before the\nsound of bones breaking could even be\nheard, Marlinia's swift blade had\nalready struck down. A long, narrow\nblade, even taller than Marlene, sliced\nthrough Miyamoto Mousashi's body. The\nninja stared in disbelief at the\nbottomless wound on his chest. His eyes\nrolled back and he collapsed with a\nthud. Have you fully realized how big\nthe gap is between you and me? Marinia\ncasually flicked her long sword and\nturned to leave. Miiamoto Mousashi\nfallen in battle. Dugu, Jaolon, and\nMarlinia, who were calm and collected,\nwere teleported back. The people in the\nlive stream remained silent for a full 3\nseconds. Holy crap, that's awesome. Her\nname is Melia. Her name is Valkyrie.\nEven a legendary gold quality Miiamoto\nMousashi is but a single strike against\na Valkyrie. Valkyrie, what a wonderful\nnickname. strong, beautiful and strong,\nagile and powerful. I hereby declare\nthat Male Nia is my favorite hero in\nthis duel. What good is it if you like\nher? The Valkyrie is someone else's\nhero, Dugu Jaolon. What does it have to\ndo with you? I don't care. The Valkyrie\nis the most beautiful. The Valkyrie is\nthe strongest. We have hope in this\nduel. Ishina's rival is Melia. Is the\ndifference between the golden legendary\nversions really that big? In the rest\narea, the lords of Lshia also had their\neyes shining. In the previous battle,\nbecause the opponent was too weak, Melia\ndidn't even have a chance to show her\nskills and simply killed the enemy with\na few slashes. In this battle, facing\nthe powerful legendary hero of Japan,\nMarlinia still managed to kill Miyamoto\nMousashi with a single strike, thus\nrevealing her formidable strength.\nActually, the golden legendary rank is\nalso divided into grades, but you\nstarted the heroic arena not long after\nyou arrived, so you may not know about\nit. This classification is the commonly\naccepted term in the official area, but\nno one has ever heard the main god\nsystem mention it. Lin Dao, who joined a\nyear earlier, explained, \"The quality of\nthe golden legendary also has five\nlevels: low, medium, advanced, high, and\nperfect. The differences between these\nfive levels are quite significant. It's\nsomewhat like it's a bit like the\ndifference between the top student in\nthe best class of the school and an\nordinary student, even though they both\ngot into the best key high school. Lyn\nSha walked over and answered, \"Yes,\nyes.\" Lyn Sha described it very vividly.\nThis is the chasm-like gap between the\nfive social classes. It would be more\nvivid to use the difference between an\nordinary student from Peaking University\nand Wei Shun as an example. Lyn Sha\nthought to himself, \"It is said that the\nperfect grade golden legendary quality\nis no less powerful than the mythical\nquality whose existence is uncertain.\"\nLynn Douching continued to explain.\nTherefore, if it's a matter of crossing\nseveral social classes, it's not\nsurprising that Marlinia could crush\nMiiamoto Mousashi. Baka in the Eastern\nJapan district, the scene was completely\ndifferent. Yamamoto Isuroku had returned\nto his rage. Sakura Shikaru, didn't you\nsay that your Miiamoto Mousashi,\naccording to the tier classification, is\nalso considered a mid-tier gold legend?\nHow come he couldn't even withstand a\nsingle strike from that so-called\nValkyrie on the other side? A golden\nlegend has become someone else's\nstepping stone. Could it be that the\nValkyrie is a top tier perfect golden\nlegend? Sakura Shichiro knelt on the\nground, his eyes bloodshot and his fists\nclenched, but he could only remain\nsilent in the face of Yamamoto s\nrepeated questioning. Upon seeing this,\nYamamoto Isuroku was furious. Useless\ntrash. Get out of here. Bring in\nToyotomy Jennyro. The competition\ncontinued and soon the three rounds of\nelimination matches ended and the top 16\nwere determined. Lia's side. Only the\nfollowing pairs made it into the top 16.\nLin Shiao and Pay Min, Dugu Xiaolan and\nMarlinia, Chufinga and Olaf, Lin Daoing\nand Gandalf, and Ding Lelay and Yuzurro.\nThe martial arts arena is a duel between\ntwo opposing factions. This means that\nthe five of them need to defeat an\naverage of two enemies to compete for\nthe final victory.",
