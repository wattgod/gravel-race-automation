          "transcript": "It's a great gravel grind gets underway\nat the football ground at yoga where\nregistration is the finish line is all\nthat kind of thing. Head through forest\nto start with. Bit of ashelt screaming\ndownhill on this ashfelt and then the\ngravel starts from here at about the 5k\nmark.\nHow beautiful is this spot? Worth\nstopping at the 15k mark. See if you can\nsee a platypus in the Jello Brown River.\nAlso worth stopping because this is the\nstart of the biggest climb of the day.\nProbably 15 kilometers of uphill from\nhere through beautiful forest to the top\nat Turtton's track. 27k mark, you get to\nthe top of Laden's track and a timeout\nzone with a water point. Soak up some\nscratch, chew some more calories, wait\nfor your friends. Timeout zone means\nyour time has stopped. You can wait for\nyour friends, check your tire pressure,\nhave something to drink before few\nundulations from here, then a long\ndescent is coming all the way down to\nApollo Bay. Look at this place. for you\nlike we are surrounded by tall fern\ntrees, mountain ash, myrtle forest. It\nis uh lush country through here. We're\nat about the 45 km mark at near the top\nof the descent. We've started descending\ndown to Apollo Bay. It's sort of a\ntechnical kind of ride. You know, real\ntwisty, turny, you know, the gravel is\nhard packed, but uh you know, a little\nbit rough in parts. Uh certainly easy\ngoing for a good quality uh gravel bike,\nbut how good is this?\nJust be a fast flowy descent. Going to\nbe quite technical in places with some\nsharp turns. But have a look at the\nrainforest going past me. So the 60k\nmark, you descend down to Apollo Bay.\nSea level, seagulls, fresh air, potato\ncakes, free time, have yourself a Pepsi,\nwhatever it matters. That's all in a\ntimeout zone so you can wait for your\nfriends and rebuild for the climb back\nback over the forest.\nSo after enjoying the delicacies of the\ncafes at Apollo Bay, it's along the\nGreat Ocean Road for a couple of\nkilometers. Turn left onto Wild Dog\nRoad. Beautiful road, one of our\nfavorites in the whole ways. Starts out\nas Ashford for a number of kilometers\nand then continues uphill through more\nrainforest up to the next water point at\nthe Mount Sabine summit. It's 19 km from\nsea level to the highest point of the\ncourse on Mount Subine. Okay, so the 80\nkm mark of the big gravel grind. You get\nto the Otway ordeal or as we call it the\nSabine show. Okay, it's 1 kilometer\nfrom here to the timeout zone at the\ntop. But you've got three challenges to\novercome. The first one right here is\nthis steep, sometimes muddy, very rarely\ndry ramp that gets you through the\nforest. Okay, stage two of the Otway\nordeal has ruts and mud holes like\nlandmines. It's a matter of choosing\nyour line through, keeping the wheels\nturning as best you can.\nAnd so the third stage of the ordeal is\nthis final ramp through the rainforest\nthat gets you basically to the summit.\nSo the way ordeal does come to an end. I\npromise you that at the summit of Mount\nSabine right here, it's flats. You're at\nthe highest point of the ways. It's all\ndownhill from here to the finish line\nafter you've enjoyed a timeout zone,\nsome more scratch nutrition, and I think\nsome tasty cassadillas off the barbecue.\nHappy days.",

          "transcript": "I feel like\nAll right. So, here we are uh here at\nForest Footy Ground uh just near Yogurt\nStreet. Uh just about to hit up the uh\nnew 160k uh GOG uh route for I think uh\nFebruary 26th. I think the events are\nthe uh the Great Gravel Grind. Anyway,\nbeautiful weather, lot of breath of\nwind, uh quite cool, 7°. Um but uh let's\nget into it. Let's have some fun.\nUh so the official start of the GOG. Uh\nI think pavement for the first 10ks,\n15ks.\nuh up until we get to road night which\nis about a 15k climb.\nSo straight off the finish line start\nline there's this little pinch here.\nI remember last year didn't get a really\ngood start. Dropped my chain and uh\nfront pack took took off.\nSo just be ready. Just a little climb at\nthe very beginning up Yoga Street\nand straight onto our first bit of\ngravel about 500 meters in.\nRight off Yoga making our way into\nforest and a nice\ngentle descent down.\nBut actually it's quite fast.\nAnd just a little pinch up here\ninto Forest. H bit of red on the Wahoo.\nLittle pinch as we come into Forest\nTownship. Working our way down the\ntarmac left onto Road Knight for the 15k\nclimb.\nup towards Ladness track\nand just a descent down\nto Road Knight Road\nwhere we make a left\nand a pretty firm compact gravel. A nice\nbeautiful steady climb. I think it's\naround about 3 4% average.\nSo we make our way left into Road Knight\nCreek Road. Now your legs are warm. Get\nyourself tucked in. Find your rhythm.\n15Ks.\nBeautiful. One of the most beautiful\nclimbs. Nice steady compact gravel. Find\nyour rhythm. Settle in. Don't get too\ncarried away.\nRoad night. Creek Road.\nI hope you can appreciate just the\nquality of the gravel here on Road\nKnight Creek Road. Little bit loose in\nthe middle as you'd expect.\nUh but uh other than that, shoot is\nalmighty compact. Here we are at Way\nForest.\nOne of the gradual descents along road\nnight creek road.\nrolling back up.\nLet's check out those views.\nPlantation off to the left.\nGravel a little loose, but still really\nnice. So we just make our way slightly\noff to the right from point uh so from\nroad ride road night creek road uh up on\nthe ridge road. One thing worth\nmentioning about the gravel around here\nand obviously obvious to most um the\nreason why it's such quality gravel\nthroughout all four seasons\njust doesn't get the sun.\nSo we don't get those massive\ncorrugations through here and stays\nrelatively compact. Obviously for fire\nbeach forest is the wetest part of\nVictoria.\nSo you're in for a treat.\nUh bit of a red pinch on the mahoo and\nmaking a left onto bridge track\nas we make our way to laders.\nJust remember taking in some of the\nviews around you, especially off to the\nleft where you overlook\nthe plantation\nand make sure\ncast your eye on that exquisite mountain\nash. Some of these trees hundreds of\nyears old.\nHave a look at these big boys. Poor\ngirls.\nAmazing.\nMake sure you take it in.\nDoesn't get better. Much better than\nthis.\nJust bombing down ridge track here.\nLittle bit loose. Couple of turns quite\ntight. So watch your line. Some\ncorrugations on the inside of the turns.\nMake sure you take in.\nBeautiful. Massive mountain there. Uh\nhere we are at Jellybran River.\nAs you fly down Ridge Track, make sure\nyou take this in if you can in that\nsplit second. Uh this is Jelly Brown\nRiver\nand absolutely stunning.\nSo on to Ladness track.\nUh web of wall climbs is my favorite,\nmost favorite. It's just a steady 3 4%\nthat you find your gear, find your\nrhythm, just breathe and take it in.\nFrom the bottom of this track, we're\nclimbing to 540 m above sea level. It's\npretty much close to the top. Uh mani\nmounts a bit. I think it pushes 580 to\n600. Actually, might be more 600 plus,\nmaybe 610, 620.\nAnyway, uh this climb here, 427 m left,\nabout 435 all up on Martins. Big word on\ntires. So, I've got my old girl riding\ntoday. So, my old Willia uh which is\nwhat I don't uh race with. Anyway, I'm\nrunning the Cuado Gravel MS. Don't\nrecommend anything that's got too much\ntread through the middle of the tire.\nThat's as complicated as it can get. I\nreckon the reavers, something like that.\nUh, a bit of tread on the outside, bit\nmore flatter through the middle and drop\nyour PSI. I'm running mine too high at\nthe moment. I can definitely feel it. I\nreckon almost like 22, 23, 24, 25 maybe.\nUh, you definitely notice a difference\nholding traction on that loose gravel.\nI honestly don't think you can get a\nbetter morning. Oh jeez. I hope you\nappreciate\nthe greenness, the peacefulness, the\ntranquility.\nAh,\namazing.\nStill on this.\nStill climbing like this. Still\nclimbing.\nStill climbing. Still climbing. Make\nsure you say hello to the\nlocal walabies,\ndude.\nLadness track climb. That first climb.\nAnd we're uh where are we?\nWe are\n27ks in and 500\nabout 500\nabove sea level.\nSo, here we are the intersection Apollo\nBay 34 to the left, Beach Forest 5Ks to\nthe right, and we have just come up\nLinus track. Uh, obviously we hit Tarmac\ndown all the way down, I think. Uh,\nactually, this is all new to me, so I've\ngot absolutely no idea. Just following\nthe uh the road GPS route, so I know\nwe've got a bit of tarmac, though.\nThat's the first climb done\nand the biggest climb\nfor the event. Don't quote me on this,\nbut I think at the top of the of Ladness\ntrack, I think this actually is a\ntimeout zone where you get to chill out.\nI think Scratch put on food. I know\nthere's a couple of those throughout the\nuh throughout the event. So hopefully he\ngets a reward for effort.\nSo just a left onto C view bridge. C\nView Ridge Road now. All new territory\nfor me. Gentle descent down C view View\nRidge Road.\nroad still absolutely breathtaking.\nS ridge climbing up to 570 m up to the\nplantation and then C view ridge road\nleading to Apollo Bay. A lot more drier.\nA lot more of that gravel coming to the\nsurface. A lot more looser.\nHere we are to Old Bay Road.\nIt couldn't get any prettier. Old Bay\nRoad is absolutely stunning. Have a look\nat this fernery.\nMyrtle,\nMount Nash,\nOld Bay Row Road Descent. Absolutely\namazing. A little technical. Couple of\ntight turns. Loose gravel on the turns,\nbut jeez is good.\nStill on Old Bay Road. I think we're\nstill on Old Bay Road or maybe Kalali\nRoad.\nIt's amazing this stretch of the race.\n50ks in and probably the most beautiful.\nOld Bay Road is stunning.\nFirst view of the ocean. Can't see it\ninto the back of Apollo Bay. Wow.\nNice retro descent or actually\nrelatively fast down. Making our way.\nSo, making our way out of Apollo Bay on\nthe tarmac and then up the uh up to Wild\nDog Road.\nSo, here we are. Wild Dog Creek Road.\nHere's Wild Dog Creek\nand making our way left off the tarmac\nand assuming getting back onto some\ngravel.\nI'm curious about what happens at 80ks.\nI think there's a surprise at 80.\nJust seen her pop up Old Dog Creek Road\nor Old Dog Road. 18.8Ks,\n3% average. So, she should be nice and\nsteady. long\nclimbing to 600 m and see a lot of\nyellow and a lot of green. No red.\nSweet.\nHere starts the gravel\nroad. Grab looks sweet once again. Nice\ngradual steady gradient.\nBeautiful backdrop.\nStill climb an old dog.\nFeel like an old dog.\nBeautiful.\nUh so, so we are 70 odd ks in and we\nhave an issue. Check this out. Free hub.\nMy free hub is seized. Been here for\nhalf an hour trying to get it to\nrelease,\nbut it looks like\nthat's going to be it. It's about\nanother 26ks to get back. And uh it\nlooks like I'm hitchhocking home.",

stoked to ride bikes and like I\nkeep saying that's sort of what it's all\nabout for\nme welcome to the gravel cycling\nAustralia podcast gravel cycling in\nAustralia is booming from racing to

organizers of the great Otway\ngravel grind event I was lucky enough to\nhead to the great Otway gravel grind\nlast year for my first ever gravel race\nexperience and had a really great day\nout on the bike I I went probably a bit\ntoo hard out of the blocks and and\ncracked with about 60k still to go but\ngosh yeah it was a great experience to\nto get out deep into the Otway forests\nand and really experience gravel riding\nat its best uh and get in contact as\nwell with the the gravel Riding\ncommunity and and meet some of the\npeople who make this sport really what\nit is Sam thanks so much for giving up\nyour time to join us on the gravel\ncycling Australia podcast oh thanks a\nlot trist you've gone out strong there\nsaying we're a pioneer of gravel riding\nLet's uh let's let remain to be seen but\num but yeah look we we run a good race\nand we enjoy what we do um so before we\ndive in can you just share with us a bit\nof your personal story about how you got\ninto cycling and how you discovered\ngravel riding sure look I've been I\nguess a long time called a lifetime\nmountain biker um having rid mountain\nbikes for 20 or 30 years probably look I\ngot a gravel bike probably just over two\nyears ago uh realizing just the benefits\nit took me a little bit of time\nconvincing I must admit you know I've\nlong been a fan of single track and I've\ncalled myself a reluctant Road rider in\nthe past and it took me a bit of\nconvincing well why would I want to ride\na you know drop bar bike on bouncy\ngravel roads but uh I think that was a\npretty naive view on things and realize\nthat it can cross the divide or the gap\nbetween mountain bike and road so well\nand opens up you know ride opportunities\nthat neither other bike uh provide so so\nyes look as sort of you know longtime\nlongtime mountain biker sort of\nrelatively new gravel Rider in that\nrespect but uh no look i r a lot of\ngravel especially through winter uh when\nthe roads are a bit smoother and what\nhave you and um no really enjoying it\ngreat so you mentioned to me a bit\nearlier that you've gone on a pretty\nspecial trip late last year can you tell\nus a bit about that one yeah look I've\ngot a bunch of fellas who I ride\ntypically on the road bike with down\nhere along the Great Ocean Road and once\na year we get together for a bit of an\noff-road Adventure either on mountain\nbikes or or gravel or something like\nthat so yeah I think in the last week of\nNovember we did Rod the tazzy trail\nwhich starts at devonport in Tasmania\nand finishes up at DOA down south of\nhobar and we did a final day up to\nHobart principally on gravel as well so\nyeah six days through the beautiful\nTasmanian wilderness you across the the\nplateau of the Great Lakes and down\nthrough some you know charismatic little\nTasmanian towns and yeah there was nine\nof us on on bikes we look we did it the\neasy way we carried just a change of\nclothes and stayed in pubs and and\ncabins and things like that each night\nbut uh you know it was a great journey\nand you know typical of of the the\nadventures that gravel box provide that\nsounds stunning I'll have to have to get\ndown there at some point so as we\nmentioned in the introduction you work\nfor Rapid Ascend Adventure management uh\nyour portfolio of events is pretty Broad\nand spans across a number of different\nAdventure Sport disciplines so before we\nsort of go more specifically into your\ngravel events can you tell us a bit\nabout the background of the company and\nthe the different types of events that\nyou guys put on sure look rapid Ascent\nwe've been in operation for 17 or 18\nyears now and we run exclusively\noff-road adventure sports events uh\nmountain biking gravel uh trail running\nultra running and and Adventure races\nand look along with my business partner\nJohn jacobe we you know we're based down\nhere on the surf coast and at the moment\nwe run oh about 15 events around the\ncountry a year um we look we do quite a\nlot in the trial Running Scene as well\nbut look one of our longest running\nevents in fact it was the second event\nwe ever ran was the or is the way\nOdyssey H which is still very close to\nour heart being mountain bikers as well\nand local to our area uh but look we run\nyou know quite a number of events here\nin Victoria a good number of events\nactually over in Southwest Western\nAustralia as well and a couple events in\nAl Springs along the larapa trail and a\na mountain bike stage race up there as\nwell yeah pretty broad is so is the the\ngreatway gravel grind your only gravel\nride race event at the moment it is yeah\nyeah um as you said the the mountain\nbike uh Odyssey event has been a big\npart of the business now for a long time\nI think are we up to 17 years this year\nis that right yeah it's something like\nthat yeah it's a big number isn't it's a\nlong time it is and it's obviously got\nan excellent reputation in the the\nmountain bike uh marathon race scene um\nat what point did you have the idea of\nadding the gravel event to the program\nand was this something the community was\nasking for or did you sort of see the\nopportunity to bring something new to\nthe table there sure I think this is the\nseventh year of the greatway gravel\ngrind look we call it the Gog and look\nthe idea came about through look a\nmixture of our own idea thinking that it\nis a growing discipline or format and\nwould provide you know an added\nopportunity for for us and for Riders\nand and uh it made sense to great sense\nto partner with theway Odyssey weekend\ngiven the the location has access to\nsingle track and gravel um but look\nthere was also a couple of active locals\njust or friends of ours here in the T\narea uh Scott Nicholas being one of them\nwho you know is was a strong mountain\nbiker and gravel Rider who sort of\nsuggests to put the idea in our head as\nwell so look I guess with a bit of\nbrainstorming with with Scott Nicholas\nand Adam kelil especially we we came up\nwith the format and um you know settled\nwith it pretty quickly and it's you know\nit's it's uh been growing since day day\nZero or day one excellent so um the\nevent obviously run in conjunction with\nthe The Odyssey mountain bike race over\nsort of the same weekend can you sort of\nexplain chose that weekend Festival\nmodel rather than sort of aiming to\ndeliver a standalone event was that um a\nbig part of the the\nthinking look I guess on selfishly on on\nour perspective on the rapid Ascent\nperspective it's it's a lot easier for\nus and more coste efficient for us to do\nit on the same weekend we can share a\nlot of infrastructure uh personnel and\nand and details and for a while in fact\nthe two events were on the same website\nbut uh and and so that's I guess on a\nlogistical Financial perspective but on\na writer's perspective you know for many\npeople who come to the Odyssey it's you\nknow it's a real journey it's a people\ncome from Interstate and this gives them\nthe opportunity to to do two races for\ntheir travel you know a double header\nweekend um and maybe was a way of\nintroducing when this when when the Gog\nstarted I guess it was principally Road\nRiders who we thought were the market\nand Road Riders didn't really ride\nsingle track or ride mountain bikers\nmountain bikes so maybe it was a way of\ntrying to mix the two Rider types\ntogether uh for a bit of\ncross-pollination I guess you could say\nbring a few Ries on us onto uh mountain\nbikes and mountain bikers on gravel but\nbut yeah look n like you've summarized\nthere it's come together as a real\nFestival weekend of cycling we take over\nthe town of forest and you know inundate\nthe little village with M with with\ncyclists of of as now gravel and\nmountain bike so yeah I think the format\nworks really well it as I said provides\nopportunity for some to do back to back\nbut others just to two different codes\nto mix together at the same place I\nthink that's one of the great things\nabout gravel you sort of get people\ncoming at it from from all parts of\ncycling whether it be mountain biking or\nor Road riding or even just brand new\nwriters um getting attracted to gravel\nin the first place so do do you have a\nsense for how many people do the double\nversus sort of just come down for the\nGog oh it's only the toughest of the\ntough I can imagine I I was out there\nlast year speaking to a couple of people\nwho had done the The Odyssey the day\nbefore I obviously hadn't and uh yeah\nthat was certainly feeling it I think on\nday two oh yeah look look those the do\n100K Odyssey mountain bike on Saturday\nand the the 97 Gog on Sunday oh look\nthere's probably between 20 and 50 of\nthem whether you know more who might\nhave race just well just you know a\nchallenging 50k on Saturday on the\nmountain bike and and tick off either\nthe the short or the long course on\nSunday it's probably another 50 or so so\nmaybe there's 100 you know across the\nweekend that do that do two events\nthat's look I haven't researched that\nfigure but um it's not the majority put\nit that way yeah so for those listeners\nwho might not be familiar with the town\nof forest and the the broader Otway area\ncan you sort of paint a picture for us\nwhere exactly we're talking and what\nsort of environment the race passes\nthrough sure so Forest is a beautiful\nlittle um Township just in the the\nFoothills or the hinterland of theway\nRangers it's about two 2 and a half\nhours drive from Melbourne and if people\ncan picture where lawn is on on The\nGreat Ocean Road it's you know basically\ndue inland or directly Inland from from\nlawn more or less uh forest look was\nidentified for to be developed as a\nmountain bike destination about 78 or 18\nyears ago just as our event came on\nboard uh it used to be a logging town\nbut when logging of old growth forests\nwas phased out of the oldways it was\ndetermined that forests needed a new\nfuture and mountain biking was to be\nthat future and uh so you a considerable\namount of money was spent on building\nthe the the the mountain bike Network\nand we've been you know conducting the\nrace and engaging with the community\nthere for ever since then from you know\nthe full history of the event in that\nthat 17 years so now there's certainly\nno more logging around and and the\ncommunity have embraced cycling and\ntourism as it you know wasn't really a\ntourism Town beforehand there's a great\nBrewery and a couple cafes and some\nairbnbs and things like that um but it's\nstill a town with a population a\npermanent population of do is probably\n200 there a primary school you know\nthat's that's about it the next nearest\nCenter is KAC which is half an hours\ndriveway which is probably the nearest\nsecondary school but it's uh it's it's\ngot a small amount of farming land\naround it but it's backed right onto the\nthe tall timbered Forest of the AL way\nranges and which are you know\nfortunately for us permeated with single\ntrack and gravel roads so it's pretty\nmuch cycling Paradise really if you look\nat it that way it's it's got some smooth\nashev going through it too so um yeah\nit's it's a really nice little Township\nand and like I said they really Embrace\ncycling\nyeah and they've uh I think they've done\nsome new mountain bike trails out there\nrecently is that right they've just\nopened some more yeah they have yeah the\nuh the the the existing network has been\nlargely unchanged since it started or\nwas built as I said 7 or 18 years ago\nand uh look it's been maintained and you\nknow still provides for some great\nCrossCountry style riding there not a\nlot of gravity style riding in the\nnetwork at the moment and and maybe they\nrealize that sort of shortcoming and the\nthe growing popularity of more gravity\nstyle flow Trails uh they you know sort\nsome money and and just spent a fair bit\nof that uh expanding the expand the TRS\ninto two new descents and one new uh\nclimbing track they've rejigged a couple\nof other tracks and built this I've\nbuilt this fantastic sealed pump track\nand things and a skills area so yeah\nthey've expanded the network and it's it\nall provides for you know great Network\nreally for probably enough track there\nto ride over two days I'd say you\nwouldn't cover it all in one day\nanyway yeah it's a it's a really\nbeautiful part of the world down there\nand one that's close to my heart that's\nfor sure so um cly as you said it's\nthere's a fair bit of Hills there's not\nmuch Flat Road around there uh\ndefinitely one for the climbers the Gog\ncan you tell us a bit about the routs\nthat you offer for this event and have\nthey changed much over the years or have\nyou sort of stuck with the same\nformula sure so on the Gog weekend on\nthe Sunday we run two events uh the big\nring is a 97 km C it's a figure eight\nreally 97 km circuit\nand then a shorter we call this the\nlittle ring uh\n49k circuit as well yeah like you've\nsaid they they both include a fair bit\nof climbing and you know the stats in\nfront of me say the big Ring's got you\nknow just over 2,200 meters of climbing\nuh two big climbs um starts starts at I\nthink Forest about 150 meters above sea\nlevel uh but does a long climb up\ndelane's track to theway Ridge line\nalong Mount Sabine track and then a a\nblowing descent all the way down to the\nGreat Ocean Road where you you know see\nthe otways see the ocean and smell the\nSalt Air and and then a big climb back\nup and over the range back across the\ntop and down into Forest so yeah two big\nclimbs uh with a bit of undulating track\nin between and and that\nshorter shorter circuit um sort of\nmisses the Great Ocean Road section it\nuh it's it's a big climate bit of\nundulation and a big descent so yeah\nit's nice riding those gravel descents\nthey um you know descending on gravel\nmight not be the thing that people want\nto do but just those particular descents\nthat you've got in this event they are\nexcellent fun you know they're excellent\nRoad surfaces not too steep it's um that\ndescent coming down into down into kenet\nRiver I think was one of the the best uh\n20 minutes of my cycling life like just\njust so much fun yeah yeah just eyering\nto sense through look what is and we\nhaven't talked too much about the\nlandscape it's it's just towering uh\nTall Timber forests through there and\nyou know fortunately they haven't they\nhaven't chopped them all down by a long\nstretch and uh there's you pretty much\ngot your head in the forest the whole\nway for that 97k circuit other than when\nyou're the 10 km stretch along the Great\nOcean Road and you know there's arcing\ngrass um fern trees that reach over your\nhead on the corners and you know Moss\nlines you know cuting through the hills\nand and Tall Timber Just with the the\nline of the blue sky above you it's it\nmakes for some beautiful scenery whether\nyou're going fast or slow but but\ncertainly those descents um down uh down\nthe canet road to the gr Road and and I\nsee the Riders when they come in down\nthe Kang Lang road to the finish line\nand they're absolutely buzzing when\nthey've just emptied the tank down down\nKang langang Road into the finish line\nof the footy ground so yeah it's it's\nit's a great place to ride so one thing\nI noticed last year as I was just saying\njust how good these Road surfaces are\nfor riding out there I do a bit of\nriding around the surf coast and near\nwhere you are at Angley there and even\nthough it's not that far away the gravel\naround Forest just seems so much\nsmoother bit less sketchy the Rocks\naren't so big and loose do the roads get\ngreated especially for the race or do\nyou have any influence over the\nmanagement of the road surface out\nthere oh look that's really nice\nfeedback uh I wish we had more more um\nyou know say over the the grading of the\nroads or what have you than then we do\nso so no look the short answer to your\nquestion there is no they don't get grad\nespecially for the race and and know we\nhave we don't have much influence over\nyou know the surface condition so it's\nprobably a reflection of how little\ntraveled the roads are by Vehicles year\nround really that means they don't get\ntoo blown up at the end of summer or too\ncorrugated or loose so um there was one\nyear to the first year or the second\nyear uh we did we did in fact engage a\nroad Builder to grade and smooth out one\nparticular section of Kang langang roow\nthat was pretty loose and unsafe and um\nyou know we spent a fair bit of well you\nknow a moderate amount of money there\ngetting that you you know smooth out for\nthe safety of the race which was you\nknow well and truly worth doing but but\nthat's been the only occasion that we've\nhad to intervene so to speak and and\notherwise the roads um you know pretty\nwell self maintained or maintained by\nyou know the council or others who who\ndo maintain them year round um but yeah\nI agree they they stay smooth and and\nvery rable year round whilst you know I\njust in fact went for a ride around my\nhome roads here at Angley just this\nmorning and um you know put on straa\nsaying it's getting loose and a bit bit\nsketchy out there just uh you know\ntowards the end of summer the\ncorrugations are starting to grow and\nthe loose rocks are coming but um but\ndown the out ways it's it's not uh it's\na lot smoother and maybe also it's\nTestament to or evidence of the fact\nthat it it's a fairly moist environment\nand you know gets a bit of rain year\nround and that probably helps smooth out\nthe bumps a fair bit too yeah so so just\nfollowing on from that what sort of\nbikes are people running at this event\ndo you do you have a sort of sense of\nthe optimum tie width you'd recommend or\num sort of other Tech questions gear\nratios that sort of thing and and what\nwhat other gear should people be\ncarrying with them during the event sure\nlook as the Gog has grown in years and\nthe size of the gravel Community has\ngrown since this events outset seven\nyears ago we've certainly seen more and\nmore gravel bikes um specifically on the\nstart line you know maybe in year one it\nwas probably well less than 50% of\nriders were on a gravel bike as opposed\nto a a mountain bike or even a cycle\nacross bike so um so yeah certainly the\nyou know the number of gravel bikes is\ngrowing and you know you and probably\nall the listeners would be well aware of\nthat um in terms of tie width uh look\nit's as you've summarized there they're\npretty smooth roads you don't have to go\nyou know super wide or super chunky or\nanything like that so you know I roll a\n38 on my bike here and I reckon that's\nset set of gravel Kings and I reckon\nthey they're fantastic for the the roads\naround there um and gear ratios again\nthese are two wheel drive roads they're\nnot four-wheel drive tracks or you know\nany steeper sections so you don't need\nyou know a real climbing ratio or\nanything like that so I'd say whatever\ncomes I don't know stock on your bike\nwould be satisfactory and uh you know\nI'm I for one I'm a fan of a two by\nsetup with um gives you a bit more gear\nrange both up and down but but uh you\nknow if you're on a one byy and you know\nhave a a moderate sized um cassette on\nthe back and and don't outdo it then you\ncertainly get your way around the of\ncourse yeah I think I saw some guys out\nthere on uh pretty much you know Rim\nbreaks and and uh very skinny road tires\nlast year so I think it can be done\ncertainly it certainly can and and look\nI'm a big fan of just ride what you've\ngot you know I don't uh maybe I'm not\nsuch a a gear a gear nuts and um but\nwelcome people just having under un\nunderlying encouragement for people to\nget out there and give things a go and\nand not get too wound up on their\nequipment for this event anyway yeah no\nthat's great um so the race has a pretty\ndistinctive format compared to the\nOdyssey you've Incorporated these\ntimeout zones in the in the course can\nyou tell us a bit more about these and\nwhat was the thinking behind that sort\nof\nformat sure look um you know the gravel\nscene has evolved a fair bit I guess and\ngrown uh matured maybe you could say it\nwas maturing since we started the race\nseven years ago but but even then even\nirrespective of that I probably wouldn't\nchange the format um so look I guess you\nknow our ideas are based on our thinking\nseven years ago and uh and like I said I\nthink that's still pretty current right\nnow to a fair extent but the 97 km\ncourse is divided into four um let going\nrace segments and then with three\ntimeout zones you know interpers through\nthat so uh the 97k the first segment so\nto speak is 33k uh taking you from the\nstart uh from the start line so it's\nit's racing from the start so right up\nto to the top of the Ridge at the 33k\nMark and and then we've got a you know\ncoffee card and a water point and and\nthe timeout zone is only about 200 M\nlong in terms of distance but it allows\nyou to stop and regroup with your\nfriends or catch up with your husband or\nyour wife or you know stop and refill\nyour water bottle or as I said buy an\nespresso from the coffee machine up\nthere which I think is part of the\ngravel scene as part of what I see is\nthe gravel culture that gravel writing's\nnot overly competitive uh in the most\npart or or we didn't want an overly\ncompetitive Gra event maybe that's the\nway of structuring the answer um we\nwanted an event that that allows Riders\nof all abilities to to ride together uh\nboth the elite and the weekend warrior\nand and the first timer and maybe\ninfluenced a little bit by the gravity\nand dururo format in mountain biking\nwhere you know you you race the downhill\nsegments you Cruise the Liaisons and the\nclimbs and allows Riders of different\nspeeds and abilities to basically share\na race together where in a Non-Stop\nformat you see see one another at the\nstart and you wait hours for each other\nat the finish line that's about it so\nthe Gog is you know influenced by that\nas well so yeah around that 97 km as I\nsaid there's there's a a coffee cart at\n33k Mark and then when we hit the Great\nOcean Road in fact there's a 10 km liaz\non stage uh along the Great Ocean Road\nso people can stop at w River at the\ncafe and go for swim on the the beach or\nsomething and then uh and then head back\nup the climb uh going back through that\ntimeout point at the 66k Mark and then\nuh sorry at the 80 83 and then and then\nback down into the finish line so so\nthat's sort of some of our thinking it's\nit's it's our take on the gravel format\nand what um what works best and this the\nthe race environment and atmosphere that\nwe wanted to provide I think it's it's a\ngreat fit for that gravel culture you\nknow it's not only grateful for the\nopportunity to stop and catch your\nbreath you do get that opportunity to to\nmeet people and and and chat and sort of\nshare the day with everyone else so yeah\nI think it's a great format for gravel r\nsorry for gravel riding yeah and look we\nwe we do you know fortunately receive a\nlot of feedback on that and uh you know\nreally positive people like the fact\nthey can you know as stop and top up the\ncaffeine or wait for a friend and it\njust winds back the whole competitive\naspect for the weekend warrior a lot and\nand on a on a on an elite perspective at\nthe front you know they have their own\nstrategy which we can we can talk about\nlater on so um yeah no it works really\nwell so I see there's a pretty exciting\ndevelopment for the race this year\nyou've been added to the Grand Fondo\nWorld Tour gravel series can you tell us\na bit about this series and what it\nmeans for people who are going to be\nwriting the event this year sure yeah\nlook uh we're approached by the uh the\ngravel World Series the world tour uh to\nbe involved with their existing series\num it's coordinated by a fell in uh in\nAndor actually and um they conduct he\nconducts an event there but he's brought\ntogether oh look it's 10 or 15 different\nevents around the world um into a gravel\nseries and um with a view to yes bring\nRiders together or showcase rides and\nraces to other Riders around the world\nso there's you know races in Africa and\nAsia and and North America and Europe\nand and now Australia as well um there's\na point structure that allows writers to\ncompare their performance against the\nother events in the series so it's not a\npure time comparison but um and I won't\ngo into their formula but there's the\nability for me to you know compare my\nperformance at the Gog with the\nperformance of someone who you know\nraced in uh in this African race and and\nsee how I performed on a on a you know a\ncomparative perspective of some some\naccuracy I guess um there're also you\nknow combining points to try and\ndetermine a you know series leader or a\nseries um you know Champion or something\nlike that but principally it's about\nparticipation awareness and cross\npromotion and and trying to bring\nwriters and writing locations together\nmore than anything else it's it's not\nanofficial UCI um sanction series\nthere's no you know commissaires coming\nto check all the courses it's it's you\nknow this guy uh Danny has a very\nsimilar outlook on events and writing\nand and and life as us to to be that you\nknow the more people on bikes doing this\nstuff the better\nand you know let's not put too much red\ntape in the way and and have\nqualifications and restrictions and\nrules and that kind of stuff it's it's\njust getting people out on\nbik great um so you Market the event as\na gravel grind and we've sort of touched\non the competitive aspects of it so\nRiders are timed over the four segments\nand uh the front of the race is one for\nthe fast guys I think it's sort of been\nreferred to in some circles gravel\nracing is a bit of a mullet setup you\nget that business up the front with the\nelite races and then a bit of a party at\nthe back with the recreational Riders um\nyou certainly do attract some really\nstrong domestic Riders uh I didn't get\nmuch of a chance to see the front of the\nrace during my participation last year\nuh can you share a bit about what goes\non up there what's the vibe is it sort\nof ultra competitive or do even those\nguys take the racing a bit less\nseriously than perhaps they would a road\nrace or even the more established\nmountain bike marathon races for\ninstance H look it's a good question and\nyou know hard for me to touch on CU I'm\nnot up the front the field either\nTristan on on Race D but I certainly\nchecked to them at the finish line and\nand they they come back saying we've\njust had a bloody great day I don't know\nbikes um and and yeah they' probably Hur\neach other at the climbs but they've um\nthey've stopped for coffee halfway\naround like how how freaking cool is\nthat you know that the the front of the\nfield you know stopping for an espresso\nand and and a bit of a chat before it's\nyou know game on again so the way I\nthink their strategy and uh out to win\nthe race it comes down of the first\nsegment so I mentioned earlier on the\nfirst segment's 33k long it's got a big\nclimb of probably 700 M of climbing or\nmore um and so generally the first Rider\nthey they hit they they hit each other\nup that first climb and then regroup at\nthe water point and basically whoever\ngets to that first watero with a Time\nmargin needs only to sit on the wheel of\neverybody else for the rest of the race\nso I think that's uh you know Tasman\nwho's won the event a couple of times\nhis his tactic as well as everybody else\nis is try and get a bit of a gap going\ninto that first segment and then you\nknow his say his work is done then maybe\nit's how risky he wants to be on the\ndescents and I know some people have\ntried to get a bit of a gap on descents\nbut but you you know you probably win\nraces going uphill rather than downhill\nquickly so um so yeah look they they\ncome back they they're pumped they've\nhad a good chat they've stopped for\ncoffee in most of the time they've you\nknow had a beautiful Scenic ride you\nknow through a nice part of the world um\nand and they you know they're pretty\nenthusiastic about it so yes you know as\nD I say it's I'm just really stoked I'm\nI'm proud that we've got a format that\nthat the elite Riders can have a great\nday at as well as the Weekend Warriors\nand those who are new to the sport can\nhave a great day at as well and you know\nsaid first Tim is all out there you know\nbeing stoked to ride bikes and like I\nabout for me\nit's good to hear that they stopped for\na coffee I was I was sort of a bit\ncurious about whether they stopped at\nthose those um points or or not and just\npowered through but it's good to hear\nthat they sort of embrace that gravel\nculture a bit as well yeah they're\nstopping but they very much again I've\nnot seen it but from what I they're very\nmuch keeping an eye on each other up\nthere because if someone you know gets\nout of the time segment before them and\nthey can't catch them then you know\nthere's suddenly a break in the field so\nso they I think it's by mutual agreement\nyou everyone looks around okay we read\ngo okay let's go and they'll they'll\nrestart themselves do you do you recall\nwhat sort of times they're setting at\nthe front for that 97 km big ring it's\npretty quick from memory I think it no I\ncan't remember it's it's in the it's in\nthe three three and a half hour margin\nMark I think like that so certainly\nunder four hours I see to think but uh\nno I can't remember\nexactly so as you said Tasman n cvis\ntook out the title last year really\nstrong guy on the domestic scene with a\nbig mountain bike background Sly\nCourtney sherwell took out the women's\ntitle and we saw how strong she was\ngoing on to win the the inaugural dirty\nwary I saw on Instagram the other day\nthat You' posted that the newly Crown\ntour down under Champion jayvine was\nalso a previous winner of the Gog from\n2018 uh you've had other big names Peter\nMullins Bren sorry Brendan Johnson some\nother big hitters down at the event last\nyear I love sharing the start line with\nguys like Mitch Docker and Simon garens\nis it a focus for Rapid Ascent to try\nand attract these this big name Talent\nor is it more sort of a build it and\nthey will come sort of\nthing yeah very much the ladder really\nyou know build it and they will come um\nyeah as I said it's it's our Endeavor to\nconduct any events in our portfolio such\nthat it Embraces challenges and\nwelcomes um Riders of all abilities so\nso no we we don't uh we don't you know\npay guys to come or or you know really\nchase the elite end of the field um and\nyou know and Stoke Simon I didn't know\nwas coming or Mitch Docker actually they\njust Simon Just that's a funny story\nthere he rocked up to enter on the day\nand and uh actually John's son was\nManning the the registration tent as\nwell as um our other other crew were\nwere Manning the registration tent and\nand Simon came to enter and I think\nmaybe Fergus was writing down his his\ndetails or entering his details in the\ncomputer assignment okay garens okay how\ndo you spell that please just uh in his\nabsolute you know uh you know\n19-year-old naivity you know didn't\nfully recognize who you know Simon\ngarens was at the time and Simon wasn't\nput out by that you know he came for a\ngood role with his mates and and I think\nI think in fact um the cycling tips guys\nyou know encouraged them to come down\nfor a bit of a ride and and um you know\nAl elbow and um and Wade come down each\nyear and race it and and uh you know\nencourage Mitch and Simon to come down\nand yeah they came and had a great ride\nso that's really nice oh great so\nwomen's cycling has been much maligned I\nthink it's fair to say for a long time\nseems like they're finally starting to\nget the sort of coverage that it\ndeserves can you share with us your\nexperience of how both female racing and\nparticipation has changed over your time\nrunning the\nGog yeah I mean that's a big big\nquestion um we we um we conduct more\nthrough our odysey the mountain bike\nevents a specific program to encourage\nand support female competitive mountain\nbikers um or encourage more female\nRiders to to enter races and feel\nconfident and comfortable entering races\nand we call this program The Odyssey\nangels and it's been running for seven\nor eight years where we provide a whole\nrange of initiatives and support to\nencourage participation um from closed\nFacebook groups where they can you know\nuh engage and ask questions that are\nlimited to women only uh to a meet and\ngreet nights beforehand um to a female\nonly start on the 30k mountain bike and\nand a range of other initiatives so um\nwe're trying to extend that across the\ngravel grind as well um so look that's\nthat's that's uh certainly starting to\nyou have some success so we're seeing\nsome increase in female participation in\nthe mountain bike uh side of things as\nwell as on the gravel as well um with\nyou know maybe 20% I was looking at the\nnumbers before about 20% of our gravel\nGrinders are are typically women and and\num probably 15 to 20 across our mountain\nbike races the day before so uh yeah we\nwe try to provide you know a environment\nthat's welcoming for both\ngenders you seeing growth in the\nparticipation of women year-on year or\nyeah yeah it's a slow fear slow growth\num but but yes and again we received\nsome lovely feedback from women who have\nfelt enabled and encouraged and and and\nnot confronted to attend a you know\npretty bloky scene you know D I said\nmountain bike races can be pretty bloky\nit's a lot of testosterone and\ncompetitiveness and and equipment and\nand things that you know are a bit scary\nfor those men or women who are AR\naccustomed or new or or still learning\nthe sport so yeah numbers are growing\nand and the strength of those of the of\nthose women that do ride is is you know\ntheir confidence is growing year on year\nas\nwell so gravel racing sort of has its\nheart obviously over in the US um\nthere's been a bit of debate over there\nrecently about safety at the front of\nlarge gravel events where you get those\namateurs and Pros mixing in the same\nbunch uh there's also been a lot of\ndiscussion there about how to deliver\nthe best racing experience for the elite\nwomen in these massart events and\nparticularly how how we can cover um\nthem in terms of coverage an event like\nUnbound gravel in the States they're\ntaking measures to start the men's and\nwomen's Elite Fields marginally ahead of\nthe age group athletes is this something\nyou'd consider for Gog or do you not\nseem to have sort of the same issues\nwe're seeing over\nthere look I don't think we have the\nsame issues yet uh I say yet um the\nnumbers and the competitiveness and the\nprofessionalism of of gravel Riders and\nracing and and Racers is is still\ngrowing in Australia uh so I don't think\nwe're there there yet you know I'm not\nruling that out down the track if if uh\nmore and more Elites come and it becs\nmore and more competitive and and and\nthis you know a grow issues uh we do\ntackle those types of issues with our\nmountain bike race on the the the 100K\nevent look which offers a decent amount\nof prize money up the front and attracts\nyou know the most competitive um men and\nwomen mountain bikers over the 100K core\nso there we do start uh Elite females\nonly half an hour before the main Bunch\nso they have a clean race again against\none another uh without uh interference\nor pacing by by men or or others and uh\nand in terms of the men they look start\nthe front of the main field of the 100K\nrace so yeah I guess we've got some\nexperience with that with the mountain\nbike scene but I I just don't think\nwe're there yet or have that need yet at\nthe gravel grind and and like I said our\nevent is designed look it's certainly\ncompetitive and I I don't want to say\nthose at the front of the field aren't\nracing to win but um it's it's got a\nslightly more chilled Vibe at this stage\nanyway so just one last question about\nthe elite racing side of things we've\nwe've seen a trend uh overseas\nparticular with increasing media\ncoverage of these big gravel events I\nknow flow bikes is live streaming\nUnbound gravel these days obviously\nwe're talking a much smaller scale here\nbut I noticed at the inaugural dirty\nwary last year they tried to provide\nsome live coverage of the race via their\nInstagram is this something you you've\nexplored with your races or do you see\nthis being something that may become\npart of the event in the future as we\nsee increasing\ninterest oh look it's not something I've\ngiven a great deal of thought to at this\nstage um you know we want to focus more\non running a great race great safe race\nand experience for those who are there\non the day and and yeah we provide you\nknow social media updates and and um you\nknow coverage throughout the day but\ncertainly not a live feed of footage and\nand what have you look if the event\ngrows big enough that there's a big\nenough audience and enough money and\nsponsorship or whatever to Warrant\nsomething something like that we'd look\nat it but uh you know we're we're not\nthere yet and and um as I said really\nwant to focus more on providing a great\nexperience for those who were there at\nthe time rather than you know tipping\nwhat would be a lot of money and effort\ninto coverage you know I'm just not sure\nthere's the audience there at the moment\nbut um you know as I said I think you\nyou said there the gravel scene in North\nAmerica is a lot more progressed than we\nare here so you know if we're 10 years\nbehind then maybe we will be doing it in\n10 years but we we don't see the need to\ndo it just yet fair enough um so as I\nsaid I don't want to focus too much on\nthe front of the race I think the real\nbeauty of these events is that they\nprovide a great experience for the\nEveryday Athlete I think the time\nsectioned approach you've taken as we've\nsaid is a really great one that allows\npeople to um stop and enjoy the\nenvironment and the community but still\nget the opportunity to challenge\nthemselves against the clock I think you\nmentioned before you get some good\nfeedback on this formula from\nparticipants is that right yeah that's\nright yeah from the front of the field\nto the the middle and the back uh it's a\nformat that works well for us\nyeah do you have a sense for how the\ngravel Community has developed over the\ntime you've been running this event is\nit sort of always been a more relaxed\nsocial Vibe or is it sort of starting to\ncarve out its own identity that's quite\nunique compared to the mountain biking\nor the the road\ncycling yeah the the the latter there I\nthink I think the gravel scene is\ndeveloping its own culture its own its\nown community and and its own people\npeople who would call themselves I'm a\ngravel writer I'm not a mountain biker\nand I'm not a road Rider I'm I'm into\nriding gravel and so yeah I think the\nscene is maturing uh growing and and\nyeah has a has a following of its own um\nand but still you know a community that\nwelcomes mountain bikers to come and\ngive it a go on their mountain bike you\nknow or a rod to come and give it a go\non their road bike or you know borrow\nsomething else from from someone\nsomething else from someone so um yeah\nit's certainly developing and maturing\nand and people Now understand the format\nmore than they did seven years ago when\nwe started the event and so it's um yeah\nit's it's it's exciting to be part of I\nthink um You probably saw it early on\npeople coming to gravel were either\ncoming at it as sort of mountain bikers\nor as Ries coming to gravel do you think\nnow gravel is sort of a big enough\ndiscipline that it's sort of becoming\nthe first introduction of the sport for\nnew cyclists cyclists are looking at\ntheir different options and choosing you\nknow gravel's where I want to start my\njourney and are you seeing that in terms\nof um the people who are coming down to\nyour\nevents oh it's a good question um look I\nI'd say yes yes I look I'm a big convert\nand believer of the gravel format as we\nsaid at the outset there\nand um you know I just just for the oh\nthere's so many aspects I like of which\nI'm sure all the listeners will engage\nwith as well that number one the the the\nthe places you can get to um without\nthat you wouldn't otherwise ride on your\nmountain bike or your road bike and I\nsay that on on an adventure and\nlandscape and Wilderness perspective um\nand then the you know the traffic free\nroads this just feels like a safe place\nto ride I I was out for an hour and 40\nminutes this morning I'll grab a Roose I\nsaw three cars you know how good's that\nso so uh it makes sense to me that it's\nit's growing it building its own\nfollowing and it's it's where some\nriters might go to First for those types\nof reasons uh it's it's a format where\nyou don't need a skill set uh to ride\nsingle track or ride ride over a log or\nbe a to do a jump or carve a burm like\nyou can on a mountain blike it's it's\nwelcoming of riders of all abilities or\nor of no ability shall I say um to to\ncome and get on a bike so so yeah it\nprobably is a is or it certainly should\nbe a place where Riders can people can\nget into the the sport of cycling for\nthe first time that's uh that's great\nyou only saw three cars I mean down\nwhere you are it's it's Peak holiday\nseason still and that so that's probably\nthe busiest time of year is is three\ncars on a ride I could have gone on the\nGreat Road down to Laur back and look\nI'm you know I'm I'm I've sport for\nright options there's not a lot of\nchoice there one Asheville Road in and\nout of Angy that's about it um but um\nbut yeah you know I would have had 300\ncars on the grish road so yeah it was a\nnice option this morning\nas we said a bit earlier it's a\ndefinitely a bit of a festival weekend\nyou put down sorry you put on down there\nat Forest can you tell us a bit about\nthe other experiences on offer for the\nparticipants and guests to the event and\nlike what what are they able to do to\nmake the most of their weekend down\nthere sure look the the mountain mik\nrace on Saturday um is follow follows a\nclover leaf course with the football\nground the Forest Football ground is the\nmiddle of that Clover Leaf uh so I say\nClover Leaf in that it starts at the\nfootball ground they go out and do a 30k\nloop they come back to the football\nground they do another 40K Loop and back\nto the football ground and and so on so\nas a result on on the Saturday it's got\na real um uh an opportunity for the\naudience to engage and see their riter\nand cheer them on and this there's\nriders coming through from 9 o00 in the\nmorning all day and as a result we have\nyou know quite an extensive um Expo of\nsponsor stands food tents live music\nkids entertainment um bike racks and and\nand race HQ bar and and tables and\nchairs and umbrellas and things like\nthat uh and that certainly exists\nthroughout the Sunday gravel grind as\nwell whilst the rides on Sunday don't\nLoop through in that figure eight format\num with the sequence starts the the 97k\nstarts earlier at 8:00 I think and the\nthe 49k starts at 9:00 then whilst the\ngravel Riders are out riding we conduct\na 30k mountain bike race and they come\nback through there's a bit of activity\ngoing on we do a a kids ride as well at\nthe same time so fill the sort of expert\narea with families and kids and and just\nas all that sort of winding up we start\nto get the gravel riders coming back\ninto the finish line so there is there I\nsaid this this stuff happening all day\non Saturday especially but also on\nSunday so you know non-riding husbands\nand wives and kids should also feel\nwelcome to come down to the event to\nengage with that whether it's to ride a\nbike and one of those shorter options on\nthe on the mountain bike side of things\nor to go to the West Bar Reservoir and\ncheck it out or walk through the\nrainforest or you know go for coffee and\nthen come back and see their their loved\none finish so um yeah it's it's you put\nthe term Festival weekend and and that's\nsomething we aspire to is to have a\nfestival weekends down there for for\nRiders of all disciplines and and non-\nRiders as well to a fair extent as well\nis there much happening on Saturday\nnight between the the two races yeah the\nthe forest Brewery always put on some\nlive music and um you know obviously\ngreat beer and great food out the front\nof uh of the brewery and on the Main\nStreet as well and the pub um in Forest\nalso you know\nwelcomes Riders and and others with you\nknow beer and entertainment and food and\nthings so uh yeah it's a and with with\nthe whole Township being taken over the\nCaravan Park you know fulls of the broth\nRiders and families and Caravans and\nkids getting out of box and you know\nbuilding jumps or doing whatever it's\nit's just a nice scene that um you know\nmakes me smile to see people out there\num meeting one another and sharing the\nexperience and and having fun no matter\nwhat their ability or what their their\ndiscipline is yeah it's always great to\num sort of take over a town with people\nwith like-minded uh sort of interests\nyou're surrounded by other people who\nlove bikes which is just great yeah so\nfrom a commercial side of things\ngravel's it's obviously a growing\nsegment of the cycling Market are you\nseeing increasing interest from Brands\nand businesses wanting to partner with\nyou to get involved with\nGog look we're we're very grateful for\nthe long-term partnership we've had with\nfocus and C so pwn cycling Australia\nbased out of Adelaide are the presenting\npartner of both events so the official\nnames of them being you the gr or gravel\ngr presented by Focus and odyssey\npresented by Focus and you know across\nfocus and Silla they do a great range of\nyou know mountain bike and gravel and\nRoad Road and cycle across bikes as you\nknow all listeners would be aware of um\nin terms of involvement from other\nbrands maybe a bit of a\nhard hard question to a hard question to\nanswer hard for the industry having been\nthrough the termoil of Co and you know\nthe the under supply of equipment and\nthe over Supply and the lock lockdowns\nand things like that so I you know this\nwe're not we're not flush with sponsors\nput it that way and if there's anybody\nlistening who wants to get involved then\nthen give me a call um we think there's\na great opportunity but you know is\nthere increasing interest from Brands\nit which which was your question then\nI'd say to a small degree but um but it\nhasn't taken off put it that way not uh\nnot just yet yeah um I think one of the\nthe real advantages of these events is\nthat they're able to attract tourism to\nRegional towns uh particularly events\nlike yours we sort of spoken a little\nbit about the town of forest it's\nobviously been focusing on mountain bike\ntourism for a while now and I think\nmountain bike tourism has really brought\nthis town back from from the brink after\nit went through a real slump um with the\nthe end of the sort of Forestry\nuh industry obviously you've got a\npretty good relationship with local\nbusinesses there and they're pretty\nsupportive of what you're doing oh 100%\nyeah and I I can't extend our thanks\nexpress our thanks enough to the Forest\ncommunity and the businesses there for\nthe welcome they've given us over the\nlast 17 years um I feel I don't live in\nForest it's 45 minutes drive away from\nwhere I live um but it almost feels like\nhome whenever I return back there I've\nfeel that we've been through a lot I\nmean we've run this race on the last\nweekend of February every year for 17\nyears and we've seen kids who local kids\nwho started out you know riding on\nbalance bikes around the kids course and\nnow riding 100ks and and things like\nthat so um yeah I think we understand\neach other and and um you know I feel\nfeel really honored to have been part of\nthat um um that rebuild or\nreestablishment of forest as a cycling\nTown rather than a locking town and um\nyeah so you know whenever I stop in for\nride I always send a I'm no local but I\nalways to find someone to bump into who\nI know and have a chat to so it's it's a\npretty nice little\ncommunity so following on from those\nlast two questions is rapid Ascent sort\nof looking at opportunities to add more\ngravel events to the portfolio this\nwhere you see some um opportunities to\nestablish some new events in New areas\nor you sort of happy with what you're\ndoing well Tristan I can't let the cat\nout of the bag okay but we might we\nmight be working on another another\ngravel idea and I'll give away two two\ncomments being uh interstate and\nmulti-day so ex we we'll see what how\nthat evolves might have to get you back\non the Pod uh once that's all announced\nand we can do a preview exciting we've\ngot a bit of work to do and some ideas\nbut um but no we're we we're trying to\npursue a new idea somewhere so yeah I'll\nlet you know great um so obviously we're\nin a really exciting time for gravel\nwriting in Australia events like yours\ngoing from strength to strength do you\nsee any challenges or roadblox in the\nfuture that might pose a threat to the\nfuture of these\nevents oh look mate keeping it safe is\nobviously the number one prerogative for\nany event company it certainly should be\nand where the numbers get too big to to\nhave group mass starts or uh is\nsomething we need to remain aware of um\nroad condition obviously something to\nremain aware of uh and the amount of of\nother vehicle track traffic on the roads\nas well so our roads aren't officially\nclosed during the Gog and you know we're\nopen and honest about that we have\ntraffic advisory signage out there and\ntelling R telling drivers that there's\nan event on um so you know we uh we want\nto ensure that safety is the number one\nthing uh if people are paying an entry\nfee that's that's what you deserve more\nthan anything else so you know at the\nmoment our format is sustainable but um\nlike I said we're we're keeping an eyee\non those things to ensure that um it\nstays safe for all Riders and um you\nknow so that that's probably a challenge\num you know beyond that some you know\nwas plenty of spos to welcome more\npeople great so particularly in the US\nwhere gravel cycling is really big there\nseems to be this tendency for gravel\nevents to sort of edge into the\nultramarathon sort of distances 100 200\nmile sort of Epic rides most of the\ngravel events on offer here in Australia\nincl the Gog tend to be much shorter uh\nlast year we saw the introduction of\ndirty wary with a 240 km option I think\nthat's probably the longest sort of\nofficial event uh on offer in Australia\ndo you have any ideas why there seems to\nbe this discrepancy and do you think is\nthere a scope or demand for introduction\nof these sort of ultramarathon gravel\nevents in\nAustralia it's it's a fascinating\nquestion isn't it and I I don't have a\nreal answer um I I guess we as has\nhopefully been evident throughout our\nconversation we try to run races in a\nformat that is welcoming a Riders of all\nabilities and or or multiple abilities\nand and I guess we see that ultra\ndistance riding event as a big barrier\nfor a lot of people um and and thus have\nshot away from it so but you know look\nwe run ultra distance running events\n100k running events and and things like\nthat where where you know we get strong\nentry numbers\nso yeah and and people you know rise to\nthe challenge or whatever terminology\nyou want to come up with so so look at\nthe moment no we don't we don't have any\nplans to you know introduce a longer 100\nmile or 200 mile format or version and\num yeah I guess we'll keep our finger on\nthe pulse or keep looking to see what we\nthink may or may not work on a business\nperspective and and try and respond to\nthat as well as you know welcoming your\nfeedback and very much the feedback of\nour Riders as to what they want and\nwe'll try and match that with what makes\nFinancial sense but um but no we're\nwe're we're at this stage not attracted\nin in the ultra distance gravel gravel\nformat yeah fair enough I'm not sure um\nnot sure it really appeals to that many\npeople it sort of looks good on paper\nbut um the idea of writing for for 15\nhours um you know I think in reality is\nprobably not that enjoyable\nyeah my bum sort is thinking about\nthat so just sort of as we start to wrap\nup um where where do you see the Gog\nheading in the next 5 to 10 years so we\nexpecting continual growth or any\ndiversification in the sort of events\nthat you're you're offering on this\nparticular um weekend in terms of\ngravel oh look five to 10 years is a\nlong time in in the cycling industry I\nthink you know it's 5 to 10 years ago we\nweren't even riding 29ers on a mountain\nbike or didn't really know that gravel\nexisted much so uh so it's that type of\ntime frame is hard to respond to I'd\nlike to see continual grow I would be\nexpecting continual growth you know I\nthink we're now up to about 500 riders\nin the gravel events on Sunday you know\nin the first year we had 240 Riders so\nit's it hasn't been hasn't our event\nhasn't exploded in numbers it's had a\nnice growth it's maintained its somewhat\nNiche friendly vibe to it uh throughout\nthat growth without you know getting too\nbig too soon diversification look you\nknow I've said it just now that at the\nmoment we're not looking at a longer\noption but if if we think there's\nactually an interest in that or that's\nthe SC the way to go then we're not shy\nof changing the format and responding to\npeople's feedback and and giving people\nwhat they want so um but look in the\nshort term I think we'll stay pretty\nmuch with with what with the current\nformat and uh and um would just expect\nnumbers to you know slowly grow and and\nhopefully we can grow female participant\nis probably one of our biggest\ngoals excellent Sam thanks so much for\ngiving up your time to chat with us\ntoday and for supporting the start of\nthis little project it's a really great\nevent you put on down in Forest I'm\nreally excited to try and get down there\nagain in a few weeks

        "search_text": "The Great Otway Gravel Grind features two major climbs that define the race experience. The first is a 15-kilometer steady climb on Road Knight Creek Road at 3-4% grade starting around the 9-mile mark, followed by the Ladness Track section climbing to 540m elevation. The course includes a long technical descent to Apollo Bay with twisty turns and sharp corners on hard-packed but rough gravel. The signature challenge is the Otway Ordeal near mile 50 - a three-stage climb to Mount Sabine summit featuring steep muddy ramps, rutted sections requiring careful line choice, and a final push through rainforest. The gravel quality remains compact year-round due to limited sun exposure in the wet Otway forests, though some sections have loose material in the middle. Timeout zones at key points stop race time for regrouping and nutrition. The race starts and finishes at Forrest Football Ground with early ashphalt sections before transitioning to forest gravel roads through mountain ash and rainforest terrain."
