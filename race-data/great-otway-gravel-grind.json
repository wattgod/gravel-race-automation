        "explanation": "The rally format with timeout zones shows innovation, and Mark's 51-year-old first-timer experience - \"I'm still on a high 4 days later\" - suggests solid execution. However, courses conducted on public roads where \"everyone must remain aware\" of traffic indicates compromised race conditions."

        "explanation": "Riders consistently describe transformative experiences. Mark's first event \"really blew me away\" and Ben McDonald notes how \"the camaraderie and support from your fellow riders makes it all worth it.\" The timeout zones with coffee vans create unique social racing opportunities beyond typical gravel events."

        "explanation": "Race Director Sam Maffett's rally format philosophy - \"mixing race time with social time. Everyone wins!\" - creates inclusive atmosphere for 300+ riders. The 20th anniversary Otway Odyssey weekend with retro celebrations and multi-race options builds broader community engagement beyond single-day racing."

        "explanation": "Field includes recreational riders like Sayers133 doing their first race and age-group participants like 51-year-old Mark, with elite presence limited to Peta Mullens testimonials. The timeout zone format accommodates varying abilities but doesn't attract deep competitive fields."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Multi-race discounts of 40% and first 1000 entrants receiving commemorative multi-tools show reasonable pricing structure. The rally format adds unique value - riders can \"stop and wait for a friend, consume calories or purchase coffee\" without time penalties, creating social racing unavailable elsewhere."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Equipment recommendations include 40-45mm tubeless tires, quality chain lube for 4-6 hour events, and avoiding lightweight bottle cages on gravel roads. The Forrest location requires travel planning for most riders, though multi-event weekend packages help distribute costs across multiple race experiences."
