Similar to the UCI Gran Fondo Greece's 105km distance, it's a proper day's work without requiring overnight strategy."

        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "The \"trademark mix of searing heat, rocky gravel\" defines the experience here.

      "altitude": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Peloponnese mountains stay modest - no oxygen concerns, no altitude training needed. Most riding stays well under 2000 meters, so sea-level lungs work fine. The region's highest peaks barely crack 2400 meters, keeping this firmly in the breathable zone."

However, the cycling event itself lacks official recognition or documented race history. The roads have motorsport pedigree but the bike race remains unestablished."
      },
      "race_quality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "No documented race infrastructure, timing systems, or aid stations exist for this cycling event. The terrain quality is proven - Jari-Matti Latvala experienced \"a scare on SS5 when a sudden misfire threatened to derail their charge\" on these demanding roads. The surface delivers, but race organization remains invisible."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "The same gravel roads that challenge WRC professionals offer intense riding through historical landscapes. Kalle Rovanperä found it \"really enjoyable\" despite \"four difficult stages\" with surprisingly \"big time gaps.\" At 65 miles with 4500 feet of elevation, you get a proper workout through terrain that's tested the world's best drivers."
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Greek cycling culture runs deep with enthusiastic spectator support. Katerina Bratsou observed fans getting their \"dose four days in row\" even during beach season, showing \"the lack of international races which our country used to host.\" Local pairings like \"Alexandrou Christodoulou and Athanassios Samaras earned plaudits for their spirited run.\""
      },

      "value": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Greek events typically offer reasonable pricing compared to Western European races, with the region's exchange rates working in international visitors' favor. The spectator enthusiasm - fans showing up \"in a month which most people spend on beach\" - suggests strong local support and cultural value for cycling events in this area."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Greece requires Athens connections for international travel, and the Peloponnese adds logistical complexity. No race packet pickup locations, recommended lodging, or parking details are available. The 2025 rally route included service parks around Lamia, suggesting infrastructure exists but race-specific guidance remains absent."
