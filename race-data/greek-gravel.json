Meaghan Hackinen adapted by touring 380km over four days to settle pre-race nerves, suggesting riders create their own arrival strategy when official guidance is absent."
      },
      "length": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "65 miles delivers serious work without multi-day strategy demands. Meaghan Hackinen found herself \"commit[ting] nearly all my energy to tackling the challenges at hand: pacing the climbs, safely navigating the descents, and keeping myself fed and hydrated\" over similar Greek terrain distances."
      },

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Elfyn Evans describes \"a hard and rocky base and a lot of loose rocks\" while Sébastien Ogier warns of \"rough and rocky surface\" conditions. The terrain includes technical sections where mechanical failures are common - Belgian driver Ghislain de Mevius \"succumbed to mechanical issues on day two\" despite running podium pace."
      },
      "elevation": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "4500 feet over 65 miles provides quality climbing density through demanding Greek mountains. Torsten Frank notes Greek terrain climbing factors reach 31.8 meters per kilometer - \"Everything around 20 is downright alpine\" - meaning extensive elevation packed into shorter distances than typical European ranges."
      },
      "climate": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Weather swings from \"sweltering heat\" to \"steady drizzle\" and \"deepening chill\" based on rider experiences. Sébastien Ogier warns of \"high temperatures and a rough and rocky surface\" while Quinda noted she'd \"handle the sweltering heat less well than these muddy roads\" she encountered."
      },
      "altitude": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Peloponnese elevations stay comfortably below oxygen-concern thresholds. Most riding occurs well under 2000 meters with the region's peaks barely reaching 2400 meters, keeping this firmly in sea-level lung territory without altitude training requirements."
      },
      "adventure": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Remote sections like the Caroutes area feature \"lot of technical sections\" that are \"really close to nature\" with \"no communication networks available\" according to Katerina Bratsou. Hackinen described \"hour-and-a-half bushwhack/hike-a-bike climbing out of a river gorge\" through truly wild terrain."
      },
      "prestige": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Elite WRC drivers including Kalle Rovanperä and Takamoto Katsuta compete on these Greek gravel roads, with Rovanperä noting \"The Acropolis is never an easy rally.\" However, no established cycling event with documented race history or official recognition exists for the specific Greek Gravel race queried."
      },
      "race_quality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "No documented race infrastructure, timing systems, or aid stations exist for this specific cycling event. While the terrain challenges proven by motorsport use, with drivers experiencing \"four difficult stages\" creating \"big time gaps,\" the actual bike race organization remains undocumented."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "The same gravel roads that challenge WRC professionals offer intense riding through historical landscapes. Kalle Rovanperä found it \"really enjoyable\" despite \"four difficult stages\" with surprisingly \"big time gaps.\" At 65 miles with 4500 feet of elevation, you get a proper workout through terrain that's tested the world's best drivers."
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Greek hospitality shines through cycling culture - Hackinen was \"beckoned into the cool shade under an awning\" for translator-app conversations with locals. Spectators show dedication even \"in a month which most people spend on beach\" according to Bratsou, demonstrating strong local cycling support."
      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "No documented competitive field or participation records exist for this specific Greek Gravel event. While terrain attracts elite motorsport talent who note they \"will need a very good Friday to keep themselves in the fight,\" the cycling race itself shows no verifiable field size or results data."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Greek events typically offer reasonable pricing with favorable exchange rates for international visitors. Local culture provides added value - shops and restaurants \"are open late, but often close mid-day\" while \"people are friendly\" even with language barriers, creating authentic cultural immersion beyond just racing."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Greece requires Athens connections adding travel complexity, with no race-specific lodging or logistics guidance available. Hackinen made extensive bike modifications including \"swapping drop bars for flat bars and adding front suspension\" to handle the terrain demands, suggesting equipment adaptation costs."
