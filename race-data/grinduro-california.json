Stage 1 covers just 1.6 miles while the longest Stage 4 spans 5.6 miles, with untimed liaisons between segments designed for social riding at party pace. More compact than Grinduro.

The Big Climb features 'sustained pitches of 18-20%' on 'loose fragments of rock and chunky gravel.' Among the most technical in gravel, on par with Badlands.

An elite rider recommends 'big volume tyres' for technical descents, and many participants bring mountain bikes for the challenging terrain. Quincy requires 90-mile drive from Reno plus early lodging bookings in the small mountain town. Similar expense level to Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

You need actual mountain bike skills for the technical descents and 40-45mm tires that grip. Skip it if you're chasing serious race results or can't ride technical terrain without white knuckling.",
      "alternatives": "Try Crusher in the Tushar if you want legitimate gravel racing with climbing, or Sea Otter Grinduro if you prefer the same party format but with better logistics. Both will test your legs more than your bike handling."
