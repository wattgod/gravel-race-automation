      "logistics": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Remote Quebec location requires significant planning, but Caitlin Bernstein notes the opportunity to visit near Devinci's HQ and connect with Canadian friends. Quebec City airport is 60+ miles away, Montreal is 4 hours, and the metric course markings confused some US riders - Bernstein admits 'my brain was having a hard time with the metric system while also trying to ride hard.'"
      },
      "length": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "At 67 miles, the enduro format with timed segments means you're racing only 7-12 minute intervals within the longer loop. As Bernstein explains, this 'takes the stress of I can't even stop for water/snacks or I might get dropped out of the equation' since you can ride at party pace between the four competitive segments."
      },
      "technicality": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Course demands serious bike handling skills through sand, loose gravel, grass, and singletrack descents. Matt Surch describes it as 'next-level sandy' while one rider reported 'the sand along the middle part of the route was brutal, I was slipping all over the place.' Bernstein ran 40mm Schwalbe G-One Bite tires specifically for the technical terrain mix."
      },
      "elevation": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "The 5,900-foot climbing total is shaped by the ancient meteorite impact that created Charlevoix's topography. Bernstein notes the course segments had more climbing than expected when converted from metric, with the terrain formed 350 million years ago when 'a meteorite struck the area' - creating the rolling, relentless landscape riders face today."
      },
      "climate": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "August conditions in Charlevoix allow for post-race activities like river dips, as Bernstein enjoyed 'cold beers, a river dip and delicious local food' after racing. The comfortable temperatures support the festival atmosphere, though the region's humid continental climate brings rain risk that can turn the technical terrain slick."
      },
      "altitude": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Racing near sea level in the St. Lawrence lowlands means zero altitude concerns. The meteorite crater setting sits in Quebec's lowlands without elevation-related breathing challenges - riders can focus entirely on the technical terrain and sandy sections without acclimatization factors."
      },
      "adventure": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Racing inside a 450-million-year-old meteorite crater delivers unique terrain found nowhere else in gravel racing. As Bernstein observed, 'the topography of the region was created by a meteorite that struck the area 350 million years ago - not sure if it gets much more unique than that?!' The cosmic impact created the landscape that challenges modern cyclists."
      },
      "prestige": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Part of the pioneering Grinduro series but remains the smaller, more intimate version. Bernstein found it 'felt really similar to the California Grinduro that I've come to love, just a much smaller version and a bit more French.' The Canada edition draws serious riders but lacks the iconic status of the original California event."
      },
      "race_quality": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Professional organization with clear course markings and the refined Grinduro festival model. Bernstein praises how 'organizers and sponsors put a lot of effort into setting up and sourcing local vendors' for the camping, food, expo, music, and photo booth elements that define the Grinduro experience when executed properly."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 5,
        "explanation": "Delivers Grinduro's signature 'perfect party to race ratio' with camping, food, music, and river access. Bernstein captures the essence: 'These events are set up with fun in mind - camping, food, beer, expo, music, the volunteers, the photo booth, the river.' The format values having fun at the party as much as racing fast on the course."
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Attracts riders who value experience over pure competition, creating the festival atmosphere Grinduro is known for. The event philosophy prioritizes inclusivity - 'having a good time at the party is just as important as going fast in the race' - while the French-Canadian setting adds unique cultural character to the typical Grinduro community vibe."
      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Regional competitive field without major pro presence, drawing enthusiasts like Bernstein who appreciate the opportunity to race while visiting the Devinci area and connecting with Canadian cycling friends. The remote Quebec location and smaller scale limit elite participation compared to the flagship California Grinduro."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Entry fee ($200-300 CAD) includes substantial meals - Saturday breakfast, lunch, and three-course dinner, plus Sunday breakfast. Add festival access, camping available for $25, and you're getting value for a weekend experience."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Remote Quebec location drives up total costs through required flights, rental cars, and limited accommodation near Saint-Urbain. International travelers face border crossing logistics, and the specialized tire setup - Bernstein used 40mm tubeless Schwalbe G-One Bite at 30 psi front/32 rear - shows equipment considerations for the sandy, technical terrain."
