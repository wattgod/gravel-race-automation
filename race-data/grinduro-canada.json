        "explanation": "Remote Quebec location requires significant planning, but Caitlin Bernstein notes the opportunity to visit near Devinci's HQ and connect with Canadian friends. Quebec City airport is 60+ miles away, Montreal is 4 hours, and the metric course markings confused some US riders - Bernstein admits 'my brain was having a hard time with the metric system while also trying to ride hard.'"

      "length": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "At 67 miles, the enduro format with timed segments means you're racing only 7-12 minute intervals within the longer loop. As Bernstein explains, this 'takes the stress of I can't even stop for water/snacks or I might get dropped out of the equation' since you can ride at party pace between the four competitive segments. Similar distance to Crusher in the Tushar. As Caitlin Bernstein puts it: \"The segments/course were mapped in kilometers, with climbs in meters. This had me all sorts of confused - the first segment was longer and more climbing than I thought and the 2nd segment was much sho...\""

        "explanation": "Course demands serious bike handling skills through sand, loose gravel, grass, and singletrack descents. Matt Surch describes it as 'next-level sandy' while one rider reported 'the sand along the middle part of the route was brutal, I was slipping all over the place.' Bernstein ran 40mm Schwalbe G-One Bite tires specifically for the technical terrain mix. More technical than most — comparable to Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego. As Gravel Union reviewer puts it: \"The ride itself was one of the toughest 100km I have ever ridden … delivering somewhere just north of 2000m of climbing and predominantly on gravel, often with a fair dose of sand, we worked for our b...\""

      "elevation": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "The 5,900-foot climbing total is shaped by the ancient meteorite impact that created Charlevoix's topography. Bernstein notes the course segments had more climbing than expected when converted from metric, with the terrain formed 350 million years ago when 'a meteorite struck the area' - creating the rolling, relentless landscape riders face today. Similar elevation profile to Gravel Worlds. As Gravel Union reviewer puts it: \"Stage 2: OUCH! A tarmac climb … we hit gradients that had me wondering how they got the tarmac to stick to the hill! Any effort as the stage started to 'race' soon subsided to just surviving.\""

        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "August conditions in Charlevoix allow for post-race activities like river dips, as Bernstein enjoyed 'cold beers, a river dip and delicious local food' after racing. The comfortable temperatures support the festival atmosphere, though the region's humid continental climate brings rain risk that can turn the technical terrain slick. Similar climate challenges to SBT GRVL. As Gravel Union reviewer puts it: \"The ride itself was one of the toughest 100km I have ever ridden … delivering somewhere just north of 2000m of climbing and predominantly on gravel, often with a fair dose of sand, we worked for our b...\""

      "altitude": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Racing near sea level in the St. Lawrence lowlands means zero altitude concerns. The meteorite crater setting sits in Quebec's lowlands without elevation-related breathing challenges - riders can focus entirely on the technical terrain and sandy sections without acclimatization factors. Lower altitude than Gravel Worlds — no thin-air concerns."
      },
      "adventure": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Racing inside a 450-million-year-old meteorite crater delivers unique terrain found nowhere else in gravel racing. As Bernstein observed, 'the topography of the region was created by a meteorite that struck the area 350 million years ago - not sure if it gets much more unique than that?!' The cosmic impact created the landscape that challenges modern cyclists."
      },
      "prestige": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Part of the pioneering Grinduro series but remains the smaller, more intimate version. Bernstein found it 'felt really similar to the California Grinduro that I've come to love, just a much smaller version and a bit more French.' The Canada edition draws serious riders but lacks the iconic status of the original California event."

The remote Quebec location and smaller scale limit elite participation compared to the flagship California Grinduro. Less competitive depth than Almanzo 100.

      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Registration runs $200-300. Remote Quebec location drives up total costs through required flights, rental cars, and limited accommodation near Saint-Urbain. International travelers face border crossing logistics, and the specialized tire setup - Bernstein used 40mm tubeless Schwalbe G-One Bite at 30 psi front/32 rear - shows equipment considerations for the sandy, technical terrain. Similar expense level to Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

It is this phenomenal shock that created the breathtaking landscapes and rugged terrain that make the Charlevoix region famous, and a place that delights (or tortures) cyclists.\n\nIt is thus no surprise that we chose Saint-Urbain-de-Charlevoix, to host Grinduro Canada. But what exactly is a Grinduro? It’s a combo of a gravel grinder road race and an enduro: one long loop on all kinds of terrain, where finishing times aren’t based on overall loop time, but four timed segments.",
