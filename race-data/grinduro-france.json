      "summary": "Grinduro France is the French edition of the international festival-race series. Same format as Germany (untimed climbs, 4 timed descents), same party atmosphere (live music, camping, expo), but French: wine instead of beer, Vosges instead of Eifel, French food instead of German. New venue in 2024 (moved to Vosges from Monts du Lyonnais) brings stunning mountain scenery. Most riders prioritize experience over results. Technical descents reward MTB skills but are optional—untimed climbs allow social riding. If you loved Grinduro Germany but prefer French wine and mountain views, this is it.",

The Vosges are stunning, the wine is better than German beer (fight me), and the new venue brings fresh energy. Bring MTB skills for timed descents, bring friends for untimed climbs, bring appetite for French food. C'est magnifique."

Timed descents are still technical MTB singletrack (same crash risk as Germany). Xonrupt-Longemer is tiny ski village—lodging scarce, book 3+ months ahead or camp. Festival party Friday night = Saturday suffering. Mountain weather in Vosges can surprise you. Same format, same risks, slightly less proven venue.",
