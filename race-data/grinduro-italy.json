          "description": "Peo (73) and Roberto Vernassa (67) are not just mountain bikers – they are trail builders, community creators, and true pioneers. For over 25 years, the brothers have been carving legendary single trails into the wild hills above Molini di Triora in Italy's Valle Argentina.  \n\nLong before Finale Ligure became one of the world's most famous mountain biking destinations, riders from Finale were already making pilgrimages to Molini to experience what Peo and Roberto had created there. Inspired by these trails, the very first trail in Finale Ligure was created – Isallo Extasy. The spark from Molini ignited a biking revolution that continues to burn today.  \n\nBut the brothers didn't stop there: they founded “Argentina Bike,” most likely the first MTB shuttle service in Italy, which helped bikers reach the high alpine starting points of their routes. And they are still going strong – digging new lines, maintaining old classics, and riding with the same passion they had decades ago.  \n\n“No Matter the Age” is more than just a documentary – it is a tribute to the people who invest countless hard, unassuming hours so that we can experience perfect moments on the trail. It's about legacy, passion, and the dirt that connects us all.  \n\nRide bikes. Have fun. Feel good.  \n\nLocation: Molini di Triora, Valle Argentina. \nFeaturing: Peo Vernassa & Roberto Vernassa,  \nIdea & Story: TANNE 9 / @tanne_neun, Harald Philipp, Trek Bicycle \nVideography: Litschi Films",

          "transcript": "[Music]\nH for sure without Roberto and Po wasn't\nthe same riding.\nBal Argentina became so good for\nmountain biking because there were\npeople with vision that saw the\npotential of this valet for mountain\nbiking.\n[Applause]\nWhen we first came here, I didn't know\nwho built the trails.\n&gt;&gt; Hello,\nmy name is uh Po. I'm 73 years old.\n&gt;&gt; My name is Roberto Verasa and I am the\nbrowser of PO\nand I start to build track here in in\nMolini 25 years ago.\nI think the history of Val Argentina is\ndue to people and Robert and Po are for\nsure the main characters behind it.\nAll times that I come here, I I am\nsurprised because uh this valley is so\nbeautiful, so nice and uh yeah, I love\nit.\nThe Val Argentina is a secret paradise\nfor for mountain biking. There's a lot\nof potential, lots of trails, special\ntrails.\n&gt;&gt; After finally coming to explore this\nvalley and and riding here, we're pretty\nblown away. So much so that we bought a\nhouse here.\n&gt;&gt; Molina is just a community really being\nas a family here. Everybody's talking,\nsharing. The MTV is quite a big impact\nin this area. So without that it's yeah\nI don't think it would exist really.\n&gt;&gt; PO and his brother played a massive role\nin keeping Molini alive. I think a lot\nof people maybe from the village don't\neven notice that because without the\nmountain biking and without people like\nthem the valley would be kind of dead\nnow.\nThey're like parents of the trails here.\nWe learn riding from them. We learn\ndigging. We learn to stay outside. Love\nthe nature because luckily I spend so\nmuch time with them.\n&gt;&gt; I love the building. Uh first thing\nbecause uh you stay in the nature in\nopen space and always very very nice.\nWhen you finish the work, you look back\nand you say, \"Oh, nice work today.\nIt's beautiful\nto look what you have done.\n&gt;&gt; Well, I think Roberto and Po are not\ncommon men's.\nWe've seen Po digging like crazy.\n&gt;&gt; I don't think he he minds. He doesn't\nwant to give him a H cuz age doesn't\nreally stop him. So they start uh\nnot very young because they were already\nlike 40 45 years old and they build so\nmuch and they still building so much\nuh with the passion you can do whatever\nyou want.\n&gt;&gt; I love going riding with tail. They\nactually still guiding us. It was very\nhard to keep up with them especially on\nthe up here.\nAnd they also very quick down.\nYeah, I think it's it's important to\nknow the the history and and how we we\ngot where we got. Um, do you want to\nknow the story?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Oh, God.\n&gt;&gt; I know that they start in the early\n2000, even a little bit earlier.\n&gt;&gt; Po and Roberto founded a sort of a the\nfirst shuttle company in Molini.\nArgentina bike. That was the name of the\nshuttle company that they that they had\nwas running only like in the weekend and\nfor friends. The vibe back then it was\nabout exploring it. It was about getting\nyou know your friends out for the\nweekend.\n&gt;&gt; We started\nfor shuttle service. I think uh probably\nthe first in in Italy. I think\n&gt;&gt; this idea of riding all year long in\nLiura in the inland of Liora in the\nmountain of Liora actually started in\nVal Argentina with Argentina bike with\nRoberto and Poe. What I know that the\nguys from Finale came riding with them\nand they say ah we have an amazing\nplayground in finale as well. We should\nbuild something for the bicycle too and\nthat's how they start and they build\ntrails there.\nI remember around 2003 2004\nwe had 100 kilometer of trail with with\ndirty road for our group was uh never a\njob was always a pleasure to work for\nother people and so when I saw so much\npeople that come I am happy because\nmaybe we work\nHow much longer I will keep on? Uh\nI must find somebody to help me to go on\nand then\nthat's the limit.\nThat's I don't know. Now my my fear is\nto to crash because I think if I crash\ncould be very difficult to start again.\nBut in the same time I understand that I\nmust try because if I if I make one step\nback every time I will stop\nmaybe for the moment I am good. So I\nhave fun, I have pleasure and uh of\ncourse we need to to change your your\nriding know because uh 67 years old is\nnot only a number\nbut uh for the moment it's very fun and\nso I hope to to go on a lot.\nI love mountain biking because uh\nis freedom in the natural with a good\nguys, good places, good bikes,\neverything nice.\nCrap.\nSo that's that's why the the interview\nwas short because everybody",

This land primarily includes mountain, moor, heath, and downland, and much of the land managed by Forestry England falls under this category. This means that, by law, the public has a right to walk on this land.\n\nTherefore, while a sign with a crossed-out person is a critical safety warning and should be respected, it does not always represent a legal prohibition. It's a way for Forestry England to manage risk and guide people towards safer, more suitable walking routes.\n\nThis reality highlights a significant challenge for forest management: balancing public access rights with the need for user safety. \n\nI have my opinions on this and clearly not everyone agrees, which is absolutely fine as is your right to agree or disagree. I'm not changing my opinion on the response I got but clearly the signage is not as clear cut as it first appeared.\n\nLet me know your thoughts in the comments below....\n\n\nFollow me on Socials\n\n📷 Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/mark_page_music_and_video/\n📘 Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/red.bartape.productions/\n🚴‍♀️STRAVA: https://www.strava.com/athletes/10961024\n🎵 TIKTOK: https://www.tiktok.com/@markpagemtb\n\n 💰 If you would like to make a small contribution to support the channel then please hit the SUPER THANKS button 😊\n\n#calibre_bikes\n#MarkPageMTB\n#RedbartapeProductions\n#gopro\n#mtblife\n\nBikes:\nCalibre Triple B\nCalibre Two.

first\nthree we looked up the difference and\nwe're bike touring because we're down\nwith the trains yeah we've never\ndone a bike tour like this before we've\neach done like\novernight bike packing locally you know\nmuch smaller\ntours and things like that well you'll\nspeak for yourself there because\ni've done\none bike packing trip the weekend prior\nto our departure and that was my first\nexperience with bike packing so so\nwe're total novices\ni came up with the idea\nafter i rode my\nmountain bike to a downhill race in port\nangeles which is about a 140 miles from\nmy home in bellingham and that kind of\ngot me thinking about other races that i\ncould ride to and then i qualified for\nthe ews for the first time and i thought\nhey you know\nwhy not just do that and kind of\njokingly started to talk about the idea\nand then at some point if you tell\nenough people that it becomes real\nwe've essentially had\na flight\nto europe well to the uk a flight out of\nvenice italy and then the three races\nthat we've that eric's racing and that\nhas been the backbone of this whole\nthing beyond that it's essentially been\nunscripted the idea is really born from\nwanting to show that bicycles are\ntransportation for people all over the\nworld and that our expensive mountain\nbikes can also be used as transportation\nand then showing that that's like a less\nexpensive more environmentally conscious\nway of enjoying mountain bike racing\nwhich is a ton of fun world bicycle\nrelief is a charity\nthat uh\ndonates bicycles to people who could\nreally use them for transportation and i\nthink that's amazing and so i've set up\na little fundraiser that if people are\ninterested in the trip or inspired by\nthe trip they might be able to donate to\nworld bicycle relief okay so the way i\nlike to quickly describe the bag setup\nis\nthe frame bag is food\nthe rear bag is shelter and the front is\nclothing i've brought two kits\nand then a pair of street clothes\nand then for shelter we have\na bivysack sleeping bag and a sleeping\npad\nand then\nfood wise we've just been getting\nwhatever fun\ngummies and snacks and pastries we can\nget at the local grocery stores and\ncafes\nmy biggest challenge was self-imposed i\nwanted to be completely self-sufficient\nand so i decided to carry an entire\nextra set of wheels with my race tires\non my back\nand that was probably a little too much\nto take on i had a 16 kilogram backpack\nfor the last\ntwo weeks um and i finally cracked two\ndays ago when we were almost here and i\nhad a old rib injury that got kind of\nre-aggravated\nand i was in just a ton of pain\nand\ndan was feeling great because he wasn't\nlike\nnot taking care of his body like i was\ni also had a like heavy laptop computer\nfor editing video had been staying up\ntoo late to put out some like video\nstuff i'd taken on too much and so i\nthink\nthat that's been the biggest challenge\nis like\nforcing myself to like\nbe easy on\nyou know on my body and not overdo it\nfor me i'm actually believe it or not\nalthough i love seeing new places and\nbeing new places and meeting new people\nwhich was i think for me the biggest\nmotivator for this trip\ntraveling itself and as far as like\ngetting to new places stresses me out\nquite a bit\nso between\narriving at the airport in seattle and\nhaving our flight\ncancelled unknowingly to\nsome of the some of the train stops\nwhere we've been unsure of whether we\ncan get a bike onto the train\nand stuff like that\nnavigating larger cities by bike that\ni've found to be somewhat stressful\nbut i think all in all i've kind of\nfound a bit of a of a groove of flow and\nyeah like eric said we've been playing\nit fast and loose and i've\ncome to peace with that and it's been\nit's been quite good racing with all\nthis travel\ni think is not\ndramatically different uh than if you\ndon't bike tour i think\nmy legs might be a little more sore\ntoday but they'll recover that's why i'm\ntaking the rest day and if anything\ni've gained a lot of fitness over the\ncourse of the trip and i think everyone\nis dealing with the same travel stress\nif anything we've had\na more enjoyable travel experience\nbecause we've been seeing beautiful\ncountryside we've been riding our bikes\nwe haven't had to drive\nit's not as uh dramatic of a difference\nas you'd expect like\ni think it's a totally viable way to\ntravel between these races if you're\nserious about racing um\ni'm\nlike maybe not the most serious racer in\nthe world compared to like enduro world\nseries like top pros um this is my first\ntime doing the enduro world series as a\npro and i knew that it would be a\nlearning experience anyway so that's\npart of the reason i thought it would be\ngreat to do this trip with no\nexpectations on the racing but i\nhonestly do think you can perform at a\nhigh level\ndoing something like this um\nat a race like the enduro world series\nwill i do it all again\ni think over the course of the trip i've\nflipped on that idea like multiple times\nprobably every day i go oh this is the\ncoolest thing ever i want to do this\nevery year and then sometimes at the\nlowest points i'm like\nsweet i did it this is the only time i'm\never gonna do this it's fun but uh never\nagain kind of thing i don't know like\nit'll be interesting to see how i feel\na month after returning to the us\nbut\nat the moment\non this rest day\ni'm having a great time and i think i'd\nlove to do more self-supported\ntours between bike races\n[Applause]\nyou",
