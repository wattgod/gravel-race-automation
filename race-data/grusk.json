The event has transitioned from competitive racing to a timed format with \"no overall or age group winners\" and Strava segment challenges. Categories include tandems and e-bikes, indicating broad participation over elite competition."

You have to push yourself a little harder.\""

The format change to non-competitive timing reflects community focus over racing intensity."

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Kelly Paduch's 2019 women's victory came after riding \"mostly by myself\" from the halfway point, indicating thin competitive fields. The current non-competitive format with Strava segments rather than official results reduces racing depth. Multiple distance options cast a wide participation net but don't concentrate talent in any single competitive field."

        "explanation": "Weekend camping costs $15 per person with dorm bunks at $30/night beating hotel expenses.

AmadeusEsquire estimates $600-700 total cost for longer routes requiring satellite trackers, but shorter distances avoid this expense. The remote Monongahela National Forest setting limits commercial price inflation typical of destination events."
