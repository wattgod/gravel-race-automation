Race runs rain or shine with backup gravel loops if trails get oversaturated by Forest Service requirements. Similar climate challenges to SBT GRVL."

      "altitude": {
        "score": 1,

      "adventure": {
        "score": 3,

      "experience": {
        "score": 3,

        "score": 3,

      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "With a field of 200-400 riders, no field size data available with confusion over actual race format. The mountain bike version explicitly states gravel bikes 'wouldn't be any fun,' which would severely limit serious gravel participation. Less competitive depth than Almanzo 100."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Access to rarely-used trail systems in the remote Gunflint Trail area has inherent worth for wilderness riding. 44 miles through Minnesota backcountry offers solid adventure value despite unknown entry fees."

      "expenses": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Registration runs $50-100. Remote Grand Marais location requires driving time and distance with Bearskin Lodge accommodation likely at premium rates. No airport data available, meaning costly travel to Duluth or extended drive times. Higher total cost than Badlands."
