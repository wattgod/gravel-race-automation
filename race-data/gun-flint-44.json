      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "With a field of 200-400 riders, no field size data available with confusion over actual race format. The mountain bike version explicitly states gravel bikes 'wouldn't be any fun,' which would severely limit serious gravel participation. Less competitive depth than Almanzo 100."

      "value": {
        "score": 3,

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Registration runs $50-100. Remote Grand Marais location requires driving time and distance with Bearskin Lodge accommodation likely at premium rates. No airport data available, meaning costly travel to Duluth or extended drive times. Higher total cost than Badlands."

The Undeveloped sections of the Wabash Cannonball trail were not bad for the most part.  Its an old Railroad bed and the only parts we really had problems with were some loose gravel and where a detoured section crossed an active section of tracks..     The undeveloped section had great tree coverage so even on a sunny day, we felt confortable..\n\nDay 1:  Montpelier, Ohio to bridge closure at Oak Openings Metropark  ~37miles\nDay 2:  Oak Openings Metropark to Liberty Center, then road riding to Providence, OH..

          "transcript": "[Applause]\n[Music]\nwe're in our 50th state of Iowa and\ntomorrow morning we're kicking off our\nmost challenging Adventure yet we're\ngoing to be biking 500 miles across the\nstate of Iowa\nyes we're here for an event called\nRagbrai which stands for the register's\nannual great bicycle ride across Iowa it\nstarted in 1973 and is the oldest\nlargest and longest multi-day bicycle\ntouring event in the world in its first\nyear it had 114 Riders cycle the entire\nride and now thousands of people ride it\nevery year and what makes this year\nextra special is that it's ragbrai's\n50th anniversary and since it's our 50th\nstate we just thought it was perfect to\nbe here even though logistically it was\npretty complex to get here over the past\ncouple days we boarded our Kona and\nparked our van in Atlantic Canada where\nwe're spending the summer and fall flew\nto Chicago rented a truck and drove to\nIowa picked up our bike rentals and\ndrove across the state to the starting\npoint of Sioux City Iowa and over the\nnext seven days we're going to be riding\n500 miles from here in Sioux City to\nDavenport going through some large\ncities like Des Moines and smaller towns\nalong the way we have a feeling it's\ngoing to be full of highs\nand some lows today is really testing my\nmental strength but if we can make it it\nis going to be one of the most rewarding\nthings we have ever done but before we\nget started let's meet the team\nshe's a good cook and loves to get lost\nin a good book it's Jen he's a lover of\ngood pillowy treats and if you give him\na fly rod he might catch something to\neat it's Adam she can bust a move and\nspit a rhyme and she can take down five\ntacos in record time\nit's Katherine and last but not least\nhe's won with the banana and is riding\nstraight from Atlanta\nit's Elliott and together they are Shake\nnot from State Farm one two three Jake\nso apparently if it's your first time\ndoing Ragbrai you got to write a virgin\non the back of your leg\nawesome getting good if Sharpies leave\ntan lines I'm gonna have lots of weird\nlooks the rest of the summer lack of\nVirgin\nragrat for the very first time\nwe did\nwe're not only ragged by virgins but\nthis is also our first time ever we're\nin bike shorts baby\ngot all that cushion\nfeels nice it's also our first time\nusing Chamois butter if you don't know\nwhat this is It's anti-chafe cream and\nit just goes\nall down in another reason region\nmoist and yesterday was also my first\ntime ever riding a road bike so it is a\nday of first here we go\nwe have officially started I'm so\nexcited like a kid on Christmas morning\noh not gonna lie I'm pretty nervous for\nthis we are super active we love to work\nout hike do things that challenge our\nbodies but we are not cyclists most\nwe've ever recycled is 58 miles and\nwe're doing more than that today just\nthe first day in the last six more to go\nbut we're a mile in going up a slight\nHill\nit's going on so far\nthe first few miles of the ride are\ngoing through Sioux City it feels like\nwe're getting a hero send off everyone's\non the street corners and the sidewalks\njust wishing us a happy ride and a good\nday\noh my gosh\nit just keeps going and going I'll have\nto say Catherine is crushing this first\nbig hill out of town\nway to go\ndown the first big hill oh man you get\nso much speed man this is what it's all\nabout this is fun\nall right first issue\nwe're not even out of Sioux City yet and\nI think I've got a flat tire low\npressure in the back tire\nso we're gonna go try to pump it up real\nquick nice and flat\nfood is out\nall right we took the tire off check the\ntube make sure if any leaks were there\nBernie I like it didn't really find\nanything now we put it back in put the\ntire back on let it all chained back up\nand just kind of pump it back up and see\nhow it goes sure is nice to have\nknowledgeable friends\nI'd have been up a creek on that one all\nright hopefully this tire holds up\nI'm so thankful for\na friend a new skill there so that's\ncool we're reunited you the real MVP\nyeah\ngetting on the bike is my least favorite\npart I'm so not good at it\nevery time we gain some momentum there's\na train that stops us or just a ton of\npeople we have to stop and walk\nso we're gonna walk across Iowa instead\nwe've decided it's the traffic of bikes\nis this Pharmacy I can see right now\nthis is crazy\nafter a little traffic jam we are back\non the road\nhow you doing Jen\nabsolutely cried they're crushing it Jen\nit is just Hills as far as I can see\njust up and down and up and down up and\ndown\nall right first cornfield pee break\nand we never saw her again\nI have corn in my pants now\nthere are little flakes of something in\nthere\nit was\nwe got some\nyeah that's what's in my pants all of\nthis\nafter about 26 miles of riding and\nsometimes walking we made it to our\nfirst official town along Ragbrai\nKingsley how we feeling\nalong the Route there are different\ntowns that will set up water stations\nrestrooms activities or entertainment\nand food to buy to keep you fueled for\nthe ride\nall right we saw our first corn stand\nand you can't say no to that look at\nthese Beauties they take the whole cob\nhere dip it in a bucket a crock pot of\nbutter\nso juicy\nthose kernels just pop in your mouth\nthat is so good\noh yeah\nthank you for our first true meal on\nRagbrai we're having Mr pork chop which\nis an iconic food item here dating back\nto 1979. it is this juicy thick cut pork\nchop that they just cook over fire I am\nso freaking excited and we're eating it\nin someone's front yard which I think is\njust the perfect example of what Ragbrai\nis\num\noh yeah oh my God\nthat was so good\nthat's your pork chop you know what\nyou're doing I also just love that you\njust eat it with your hands that's\nawesome\nyesterday during our new Rider meeting\nthey told us that the town of Canby had\nmore pies and people and that we had to\nstop here to get some pie so we got some\nstrawberry rhubarb pie\nme up I needed to hopefully get me the\nnext 25 miles it is just perfectly Tangy\nand sweet something else that's good to\nknow about Ragbrai is that cash is King\nthese towns get really overwhelmed by\nthe influx of people so cell service\nreally doesn't work so don't plan to\nhave much cell service and make sure you\ncarry cash we ordered that 50 to 60 per\nperson per day is usually enough which\nkind of seems like a lot so we brought\n700 in cash total but we're hoping that\nwe do not spend all of it\nthank you\nwe freaking made it to Storm Lake oh my\ngosh my longest bike ride ever\nyes\nyou did it oh my God we did it\nit's a job we did it one day down so the\nmain way to sleep during Ragbrai is\ncamping and you might be wondering how\ndo you get off your camping gear here\nand if you're using a charter they'll\nbring it for you but any Ragbrai\nregistered writer can actually put it on\na semi truck and they'll bring it to the\ncamping area at the end of the day but\nwe actually have a very important fifth\nteam member Connie Elliott's mom who is\ntransporting our stuff for us and she\nsecured us a campsite right on the water\nall right it's free shower time aka the\nlake\nthey had like salt crystals forming on\nme today that's how dirty I was\nI need to like do my hair but\nboom nope not even that hole\nall right\nwhat a day one oh my gosh I knew Ragbrai\nwas going to be hard that's why I was\nvery nervous about it I wouldn't say it\nwas harder than I thought it would be\nbut I was kind of hoping it'd be easier\nthan I thought it would be yeah and it\nwasn't yeah I don't know I think the\nhardest thing for me about it besides\nthe heat was just feeling rushed like we\npart of the experience of doing Ragbrai\nis to stop at a bunch of fun stops and\nget food and rest and hang out but we\njust had to keep going we were going too\nslow we had all these issues at the\nbeginning with the flat tire and then\nalso with just tons of bike traffic we\nbasically walked super busy everywhere\nwe went yeah it didn't hurt bikes it got\nbetter throughout the day but like all\nthe lines at every food place were so\nlong so just makes you feel like you\ncan't actually stop and do anything so\nthat part was a little hard but\nhopefully tomorrow will be better we'll\nmaybe plan our day out a little bit\nbetter yeah but how I felt throughout\nthe day the first half of the day it\nseemed I felt really good like my body\nfelt good like my endurance and energy\nand all that then like the heat set in\nand the second half of the day and like\nI was hoping that the second half the\nroute was going to be more flat but\nthere was just like all kinds of up and\ndown up and down up and down yeah\nthere's a lot of elevation today yeah\nand tomorrow is going to be a really\nlong time I need a longer day I think so\nI don't know I'm proud of us though\nbecause we are not cyclists I'm not 100\ncomfortable on a bike so this this event\nis just very out of my comfort zone so\nI'm very proud of myself for biking 70\nplus miles today that's more than we've\never biked before she won't say it and\nshe doesn't think so but she rocked it\nshe did I often was the last one in the\ngroup I was often the last one too like\nwe kind of we were we were the last ones\nJen and Elliott crushed it especially\nJen because Jen did not think she'd\ncrush it and she rushed it blazed by us\nshe was just like several times it was\nit was awesome yeah but for the rest of\nthe night now that we're showered in the\nquestion nobody questionably clean Storm\nLake I feel better though yeah we're\ngonna go head to the food trucks and get\nsome dinner because we did not eat\nenough that's another thing we're gonna\ntry to focus better on throughout the\nweek just getting a lot of calories like\nthat we did not eat enough food today\nand then we're gonna go rock out at a\nconcert this band called The spasmatics\nwe've both seen them in Austin they're\ncovered man are playing tonight so\nshould be really fun\nforeign\ndespite what we said yesterday we\nactually have less miles and less\nelevation gain today which I'm pretty\nexcited about how are you feeling Elliot\nthriving at like 4 55 this morning\neverything was very stiff and and hurt\nbut a couple hours later\nI think just like Elliot I was pretty\nstiff getting up now that I've moved\naround a little bit got the tent put\naway got everything ready to go I think\nI'm ready to hop back on knees are a\nlittle sore but we're gonna push through\nit and we're gonna conquer day two day\ntwo considering yesterday was the\nlongest I've ever rode a bike I actually\nfeel pretty solid today what's\ninteresting is I expected my knees to\nhurt because that's kind of an issue\nI've had but my knees feel great it's\nplaces I didn't expect like my wrists\nhurt right here hurts just like weird\npains from just being like not really\nmore like\nall day long\num I think getting on the bike today\nshould be a very specifically the seat\nshould be a very memorable experience\nit'll be lasting imprinted into my brain\nI get into your butt and into my butt so\nwe'll see how it goes\nwhen you think of Iowa you may think of\ncorn and the start of day two took us\npast what felt like endless corn fields\nthe state of Iowa grows more corn than\nany state in more than most countries in\n2020 Iowa Corn Farmers grew 2.3 billion\nbushels of corn with 99 of it being\nfield corn which is used to make feed\nFuel and thousands of other products so\nobviously it only made sense to take\nadvantage of as much corn as we could\nduring Ragbrai\noh\nwe made it\nhalfway done for the day and now we eat\nwe are in Lakeview Iowa and we stopped\noff at this Latin American food truck\nand we got a couple arepas\ndelicious and then this is a Peruvian\nPoncho look at the size of this thing\nall right the Peruvian Poncho has a\ngiant bratwurst under there shoestring\npotatoes grilled cheese here look like\ncheese curds and then a jalapeno Crema\non there all on a massive hoagie bun\nI don't even know how I'm gonna attack\nthis this is gonna be an adventure oh my\ngosh you can't even like fold it up\nthis is gonna be a messy one oh buddy\nwow\nwe also got a pina colada smoothie\nbecause it is definitely starting to get\nhot out and this thing is so good now\nit's more like juice it's just\ncompletely melted but it's still so good\ndelicious got Thelma's ice cream\nsandwich right here chocolate chip\npeanut butter\nyou're sharing that with me right\noh this bomb no line five dollars\nstraight from Des Moines oh yeah\nmy cookies are gooey\nit has been so fun stopping in all these\nlittle towns along the way they've all\nbeen very nice and all the locals are\nsuper friendly and it's just been really\nfun to be able to experience a different\nside of Iowa that we probably never\nwould have experienced so a huge thank\nyou to all these communities for\nwelcoming us\nthis is tough\noh wow this is a Long Hill\nwe are capable\nwe got this\nthat it was freaking hard holy cow\nI may have been the toughest Hill so far\nI was barely moving\nwelcome to Brita the place kabita\nthat was a tough stretch this is just a\nquick stop for us to get some water but\nthen I found pickle pops which I've been\nwanting to try and we saw a slip and\nslide so we're gonna go do it\ntastes like pickles I love pickles\noh here we go\nit's a slippery\nwas supposed to just be for water but we\ndid water the pickle pops slip and slide\nand then we found beekman's ice cream\nwhich here is a must along rack rye and\nit's this homemade ice cream that's made\nin these crazy Contraptions I'm not even\nsure how to describe it but it was like\nchurning it it was super cool and we got\nPeach and vanilla and root beer float\nand it is delicious\nsuper creamy ice cream so so refreshing\nthat was an amazing stop and now we have\naround 13 miles until our home for the\nnight\ngood job\nimpressed rest all around we knew\nRagbrai would have highs and lows and\nyesterday had a handful of lows it was a\nvery tough day but today was basically\nall just one high it was so much fun\nminus that one very long hill\nConnie had snagged us a campsite right\nby a Rec Center so the rest of the day\nwas spent escaping the heat of the pool\nwhich was much needed and tonight we're\nhaving a sleepover in Connie's Castle\ntoday is going to be our longest day yet\nat 83 miles and we do have the option\nlater today to add a few extra miles to\nmake it a century a full 100 miles that\noption isn't until later in the day so\nwe have some time to think about that\nbut we're up early this morning with a\nbeautiful sunrise\nbecause we're gonna need all the time we\ncan get just to finish these 83 miles\nto get out quicker this morning we\ndecided to not have coffee until we got\nto the first town of Glidden so that was\nmy first stop I had to get some coffee\nand I went to a place called coffee and\nNosh and I also got this delicious\nlooking steak bowl for my breakfast I\nwent to Chris cakes which is an iconic\nrag ride breakfast spot you get\nunlimited pancakes and sausage for 10\nbucks they make the pancakes on this\nsuper cool Contraption and then when you\ngo up for seconds they throw them to you\nyou got to catch them on your plate all\nright my friend here we go\nand they are super solid pancakes\ntypical Ragbrai fashion we always have\nthe intention to just keep going and not\nstop for a while but then you see a sign\nfor goat selfies\nyou gotta get a selfie with a go\nthis is the best ever this is so\nfreaking cute\nso warm soft\nyeah that's so cute I love it that was\nprobably the best stop of Ragbrai so far\nwell I wanted to take it with me can we\nput a trailer on the bike take one of\nthe kids take one of the kids\nafter achieving one of our Ragbrai\nbucket list items of seeing baby farm\nanimals we still had lots of miles to\nmake so we hit the road and kept on\npedaling but things started to get a bit\ntough for us\nmiles are really starting to catch up to\nus today got a strong headwind\nit's warm\nso we made frequent stops in the various\ntowns to get lots of water electrolytes\ncold treats and food quick naps\nentertainment\nand see more goats I'm dragging a bit\nand I'm not making it very far before I\nhave to stop for some water but very\nconveniently the spot that we stopped at\nhas more goats so enjoy a cute little\ngoat montage\nwe're about to come up to the turn off\nfor the century Loop\nand we have decided not to do that we've\nbeen struggling and pushing all day long\nI don't think a few extra miles is gonna\nbe in the cards today we're gonna save\nwhatever energy we have left for just\nfinishing Ragbrai safely and that'll be\na quite an accomplishment in itself\nwe are about to go down a crazy Hill the\nbiggest of the day\nI'm riding my brakes because I'm kind of\nnervous\nnow the hard part going back up\nthis is hard\nwho said we wanted a challenge and we're\ngetting it\ncome on legs\nI can do it\nthis is a very long hill Oh man\nof day three and also home to Iowa State\nand one thing that is super cool and\nsomething I've been looking forward to\nall day long so we're gonna ride through\nthe campus and through the football\nstadium go Cyclones\ncool check it out we get to ride a bike\ninto a football stadium how cool is that\nthe stadium has a during Hill\nAry\nI wrote all day just to see you\nout of here it's me inside time\nso this is where we are right now and\nright there is where we started we have\ngone from there all the way to here on a\nbike using our own legs that is just\nthat is just crazy so crazy and that is\nwhere we're ending we are just a little\nbit under halfway there\nwe've been having these instant\nVietnamese coffees that we found at\nCostco it's by copper cow coffee it's a\npour over and then you dump in the milk\nand sugar creamer here mix it all up\nthey are super good and as you can tell\nI need lots of them every morning we all\nkind of look like we've been punched in\nthe face this morning the first thing\nJen said to me was wow you look rough we\nare strong we are strong we are capable\nwe are capable we got this we got this\nday four baby let's go\ntoday is the shortest day of Ragbrai we\nare riding 50 miles to Des Moines which\nis the largest city in Iowa and also the\nstate capital and it is predicted to be\na record breaking day they were\nestimating upwards of a hundred thousand\nriders with a bunch of locals hopping in\nfor just this stretch of the ride and\noriginally they were going for a\nGuinness World Record today but\napparently the record they were going\nfor was no longer recognized but we're\ngonna still count the record in our\nhearts we are going to be record holders\ntoday\nthe update that no one asked for but\nyou're all probably secretly wondering\nhow are our buds doing and honestly my\nbutt doesn't hurt that bad there's\ndefinitely some pain there but I thought\nit would be a lot worse what's really\ngetting me is a different area down\nthere if you know what I mean I didn't\nrealize that would hurt so much but\nwe're making it work we're making it\nwork you kind of\njust get used to it sometimes it gets\nnumb\nmy butt is pretty sore but the good\nthing is it's not any worse than what it\nwas at the end of the first day and it's\na manageable pain you kind of forget\nabout it throughout the day\nand the worst is when you get on the\nbike for the first time at the beginning\nof the day that is a shock to the system\none thing I love about Ragbrai is that\nit's basically a big fundraiser for all\nthese small towns in Iowa as you stop\nand then make sure to support local\nbusinesses we're in Slater right now and\nthey were doing a fundraiser to build a\nnew library and Community Center they're\nselling stickers so we got two of them\nand it says biking is greater in Slater\nand I love me a rhyme so I had to get\none or two\nthank you Slater\nso a fear today was that it was just\ngoing to be like insane traffic and just\ntoo many bikes to be enjoyable and I\nthink it is busier it definitely feels\nbusier but it's not\nit's not wall-to-wall in the towns it is\nbut one thing I have noticed is that I\ndon't know the etiquette doesn't see\nthis good today A lot of people are\ncreating like a wall where they take up\na whole Lane and no one can pass so\nthat's been a little tricky but overall\nnot too bad so far let's go\nwell this is gonna be a Super Soaker\nright here\nwe made it to the town that we're gonna\nhave lunch in but before we eat we're\ngetting in there\noh that's amazing\noh yeah oh yeah that is beautiful one\ntwo three\nthank you to the Polk City firefighters\nwe came to a local spot called Rising\nSun cafe I got a burger Katherine got a\nCuban sandwich\nwe were just loving this town it's one\nof my favorite towns along the ride so\nfar it's just super cute it has this\nreally nice square and just the vibe is\namazing there's a fan playing as you can\nprobably hear because they are very\nbombastic\none of the first things I noticed when\nwe entered town was a super cute place\ncalled the Creamery and I was hoping\nthat they had ice cream and they do not\nonly that they have Puppy Chow ice cream\nlooks so good\noh my gosh that's delicious\nI got the Cookie Monster\noh yeah that is effing good a Cookie\nMonster\nwe see the big buildings of Des Moines\nit's pretty cool we're never able to see\nany buildings coming up to towns but we\ncan see these because they are huge\nthat's one of the prettiest capitals\nwe've seen\nafter being in small towns for the last\nfew days it is so crazy to see large\nbuildings and be in a big city and see\nthe capitol this is just so surreal\nhahaha\nwe can't resist any cold water today so\nbefore we get to Camp we're going for\nthe Polar Plunge\nit's so good\nyes during Ragbrai we've camped in a\nvariety of different areas we've camped\nin Parks we camped in a Rec Center\nparking lot and last night we got to\nCamp just outside of the Iowa State\nfootball stadium which was so cool and\ntonight we're camping at this giant Park\ncalled Waterworks Park here in Des\nMoines and we have a very big night\nahead of us and first up we get to take\na real shower check out my forehead it\nis dripping glistening listening\ndripping down my boobs\nyou do have to pay for showers at\nRagbrai So to avoid that we've been\ntaking lots of free showers we've\nshowered in a lake we showered at a pool\nwe showered at a water hose I've\nshowered in the sink but it feels like\n103 degrees out today and like we said\nwe're all just completely dripping in\nsweat so I think we're gonna splurge on\na shower it's eight dollars per person\nand I think it's going to be a hundred\npercent worth it\nI'd say I feel like a new woman but\nwearing the exact same clothes I had on\nearlier because I have zero clean\nclothes left and I'm pretty sure I just\ngot sweaty again making the walk back\nfrom the showers but it did feel nice it\nwas nice and cold but showering is not\nthe only Adventure we're having tonight\nthere is a huge party here tons of food\nand we're gonna rock out to Leonard\nSkynyrd\nriding on a tractor with 50 of our best\nfriends closest friends hold on tight\nand\num the woman who's driving the tractor\nsaid if you can find room there's room\nfor you you can get on so we found room\nRagbrai is all about experiences and\nthat definitely an experience that we\ndid not expect to have\nso nervous for today\nand tomorrow we're going to be the\nhardest days of Ragbrai today is\nanywhere between 82 to 90 miles\ndepending on where you read with about 3\n600 feet of elevation\nto top it all off the heat index is\ngoing to be\n106. 106.\nso our goal today is to hydrate often\nmake quick and efficient stops and get\nto the end safely\none of the coolest things about this\nexperience for us is getting to meet a\nlot of you along the way we've gotten to\nmeet so many incredible people and we\njust came across some subscribers that\nhad a sign for us and for Jen and\nElliott and I've never had a sign made\nfor me before and that just completely\nmade my day gave me the energy to tackle\nthis extremely hard day because I am\nstruggling\nalready struggling and we're not that\nfar right\ntough this morning\nvery steep hills coming out of town\nI think my legs have just reached their\nbreaking point oh my gosh everything is\njust extra hard today oh we got this we\ngot this it's very humid\nwarm already still only seven o'clock\nit's already pretty warm\nhumid\nabsolutely so Authority these legs have\ntaken me over 250 miles and I can finish\nI just really want to nap\nI got all of yesterday left oh my God\nthis is a joke It's gotta be a joke\nthere's a nightmare or a joke I'm hoping\nit's a joke\nI forgot that today has a three mile\nstretch of gravel there's a bridge out\nso they're routing around it\nit's all gravel we have road bikes not\nequipped for arrival so we're just gonna\ntake our time I am not a fan of the\ngravel I've kind of skidded a few times\nalready\nokay I'm gonna take it slow take it slow\nokay\nsome sections there\nnot smooth and Sandy and Rocky and very\nbumpy and washboarded\nand there was a hill\nthe vibration of this is making my hands\nand fingers turn completely now\noh my gosh I survived the gravel we are\nback on pavement that was absolutely\nterrifying for me oh my gosh where is\nthat oh my gosh that was pretty rough\nthat was so scary they made it seem like\nit was going to be like really really\nsmooth and I don't think it was really\nsmooth I need to like be compressed that\nwas so stressful\nit was probably like a panic attack I\njust kept talking the whole time going\nlike bad word bad word bad word\nit was not fun\nwhat'd you think that was literally the\nworst like nightmarish Jen I was cursing\nthe entire time like I I walked up some\nof that right that was so scary we did\nit we did it no more gravel for this all\nright or ever again ever again\nall right Colfax you win for the\nsteepest hill\nso far\nholy heck\nI heard rumors of this hill\nearlier yeah\nSteve is still have a part of my life\nmade it out a lot\nwhile we may have conquered quite\npossibly the worst Hill of Ragbrai the\nhills were far from over today is really\ntesting my mental strength\nday of hills and slight mental\nbreakdowns\nbut after what felt like endless climbs\nit was time for one of the best parts of\nthe day we have made it to the fourth\ntown which is the meeting town we have\nmet up with Connie Elliott's mom I've\nnever been so happy to see her here they\ngo\nthank you this is our first time feeling\nAC in days and it feels so good so good\nif I could do it with my toes I'd have\nthree numbers going like this\nthere's all kinds of different campsites\ntastes even better sitting in the AC the\nsandwich is heaven in a bite I'm so\nhappy right now also oh yeah got a\nscotcher which is one of my favorite\ndesserts\nI know how good it is all right we are\nback on the road\nmy goal for the rest of the day is to\njust make it we're gonna stop a lot\nthat is exactly what we did the rest of\nthe day was a grind but we stopped often\nto rest and get lots of water and\nelectrolytes and we managed to have a\nlittle bit of fun too\nwe made it through our final town of the\nbut don't get it wrong we still have 25\nmiles left but we did find\nmy favorite guy on the route the guy\nwith the cold plunge tubs and we're\nyeah last night you're my favorite guy\non the route\nI don't know if we can all fit\nyeah do it Adam\nyou gotta get down\noh my God\nit wasn't possible again sit down mower\nstraight up her heads on three okay\nthree two one go okay three two one\nall right I think we're stuck\nyeah is this thing have wheels\nthis is the best thing\nthat was amazing\ntoday is really difficult this week is\nreally difficult\nto go from basically\nno cycling experience on a rented bike\ngoing for seven days in a row of hard\ncycling\nwe've done difficult hikes\nthat are as hard as these days but not\nseven days in a row like this\nand she's crushing it it's hard it's\ndifficult it's hot lots of elevation\nlots of miles\nshe's just taking it all in stride\nwe made it only a bajillion hours later\ntechnically after the route closed and\nwe started Before Sunrise\nthat was the quite possibly the most\nphysically and mentally challenging day\nof my entire life\nand we have to basically do it again\ntomorrow\nI'm so tired\noh my gosh Connie you're the goat truly\nthe goat cannot stop ever the best ever\nwe would be lost without Connie\ndead we'd be dead without God\nit is day six of Ragbrai I cannot\nbelieve that I have been on this bike\nfor six days now and today is very\nsimilar to yesterday it is about 80\nmiles there's a good amount of elevation\nbut thankfully it is less than yesterday\nand it is super hot and as you can\nprobably tell the sun is fully out today\nso it feels even hotter and our goal\ntoday is just to have mental fortitude\nto get through the day we're all still\nreally tired from yesterday so it just\nfeels extra hard today we're stopping a\nton for water we're actually halfway\nthrough the day already we're about 40\nmiles in and we're stopping for lunch\nand to be honest we don't really plan to\nmake any fun stops today our goal is\njust to get to Camp as early as possible\nso we can relax so we'll see you when we\nget there\neverybody\nI've never been so happy to see you guys\nis a journey but but you guys did it\nyeah today you can't I'm glad it's done\ntoday was a day it was a day it was\nthere's a reason we didn't film today\nand it's because we knew it would be\nkind of a repeat of yesterday and all I\nbasically did was complain so we were\ntrying to save you guys from that but\nand we just want to focus on getting\nhere\nholy cow it was a day the morning was\npretty good yeah it was the morning was\nactually pretty great I was in really\ngood spirits again another nice Sunrise\npretty smooth ride started out with\nhills pretty quickly\nbut then once that sun came in and just\nkept going the temperature kept climbing\nand climbing and climbing and it was\njust so hot and so muggy and it pushed\nus\nto our limits and Way Beyond Way Beyond\nit felt like we were riding in an oven\nwith a hair dryer blowing on us it was\nthe perfect expression right there some\nlady said the heat index was 112. I\ndon't know if that's true but I am it\nhad to be close ripping dripping I have\nice I put ice down my shirt to cool me\noff right now because I am just dripping\nno amount of water no amount of elements\nno amount of like water we could Splash\non ourselves like electrolytes this is\nlike a cooling rag I had like nothing\nwould like quench your thirst or like\ncool you down yeah we got here way later\nthan we hoped but towards the end yeah I\ntook a lot of breaks to drink 6 30. we\nstarted at like 5 45\nbut yeah it was 13 hours yeah it was a\ntough day but I'm proud of us for making\nit through yeah and I'm really proud of\nus for listening to our bodies when we\nneeded to because we easily could have\npassed out like no one should be outside\ndoing what we're doing in this\ntemperature it's dangerous is but we\njust listened to our bodies stopped off\nstopped a lot didn't worry about what\ntime we got here just want to get here\nsafe yeah but man we did it I'm really\nglad it's over yeah I am so glad I'm so\nglad to get off that bike yeah today\ntomorrow it's gonna be a very very\nexciting day\nwe're trying to get our sleeping area\nset up for the night and kind of get all\nof our stuff organized and a siren\nstarted going off there's a thunderstorm\ncoming apparently if we hear this we\nhave to go take cover and shelter inside\na building\nwhat a strange\nguys\nthe wind was dead quiet and then all of\na sudden it was a very very strong wind\ntrees were going crazy\nclipping and flopping and got intense\nreal fast\num so thank you so much for your\npatience we expect to get the all clear\nweather wise in the next 10 or 15\nminutes thank you\ntwo hours later we get to go back to\ncamp and check out what it's like\nsome tents look totally fine and some\nare not looking so hot the castle has\nseen better days\nbut it's still standing\nit's pretty dry I think\nyour bed's nice and Drive Long\noverall we feel okay\nI mean it looks like a tornado went\nthrough that's because that's how we\nthrew it all in this is a little\nslopping wedge all right tomorrow's a\nvery very very big day\nso now that we've dried our tent out a\nlittle bit we should probably get some\nsleep\nlast day of rag ride day seven I cannot\nbelieve that we are at the end of this\nat the end of day one I honestly was not\nsure if both of us would make it to the\nend but I am just so proud of us and it\nis going to be the best feeling ever to\nget to the Mississippi River\nthe day was full of focus on the goal\nthat we were so close to achieving we\npedaled through Farmland in small towns\nand around 40 miles in we caught our\nfirst glimpse of the mighty Mississippi\nthe body of water that just under 30\nmiles east would Mark the end of this\nadventure and where we'd dip our front\ntire to signify completing the journey\nand as we approached the Finish Line it\nwas hard to not reflect on our journey\nto visit all 50 states during the last\nfour years we have experienced so much\nof what makes the U.S a beautiful\ncountry full of diverse scenery we have\nvisited its deserts and canyons explored\nIslands slept with epic Mountain views\nwatched glaciers Cav check out big\ncities and small towns found hidden gems\nin unexpected places met amazing people\nand now we are riding across an entire\nState growing up I never had a desire to\ntravel or be outdoors and if you would\nhave told me seven years ago that I\nwould be biking across Iowa or heck even\nliving in a van I would have laughed and\ntold you you were crazy it's just\namazing what can happen in when you push\nyourself a little bit out of your\ncomfort zone and we are so grateful for\nall the big small happy and tough\nmoments over the years that led us here\ntoday we just saw a sign that we have 10\nmiles to go\nthe holy cow the emotions just\nhit me like a ton of bricks I can't\nbelieve I did this\nI can't believe it\nwe just rolled up to the Davenport sign\nwe are in Davenport I think we just have\nlike a mile and a half until we can dunk\nour tires in the Mississippi River\ngo away\nmy God\nwe did it\noh my God good job proud of you\nwas one of the most challenging and\nrewarding things that we have ever done\nit pushed us beyond our limits at times\nand showed us that we are capable of\nmore than we ever imagined there were\nmany moments of Doubt suffering and\nexhaustion but equally as many moments\nof Joy strength pride and bellyaching\nlaughs and as we sit here one month\nlater editing this video and reliving it\nall the tough moments have faded away\nand those are the moments that we\nremember a massive thank you to everyone\nthat worked hard on the event and for\nall the towns for welcoming thousands of\ncyclists in a huge thank you to Connie\nfor being the best support crew we\nappreciate everything you did for us\nalong the ride from finding us campsites\nhaving snacks and cool drinks for us and\njust encouraging us along the way into\nour amazing friends Jen and Elliott\nthank you for being crazy enough to ride\nacross an entire state with us and\nsupporting us through the highs and lows\nwe love you all and we can't imagine\nhaving this experience with anyone else\nproud of us\ntonight we're having a sleepover in\nConnie's Castle\nwe're being forced\nbut you're not you were the one that\nwanted to let us go you were the one\nthat wanted to minimize all activities\nin the morning no I didn't know that we\nwere supposed\ntwo hours ago so since our team name is\nJake not from State Farm whenever we're\ntrying to see if everyone's assembled we\ngo Jake and then everyone else yells\nkhakis what are you wearing Jake\nJake from State Farm we needed a little\nend of the ride Pickle
