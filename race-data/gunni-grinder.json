      "summary": "Gunni Grinder is high-altitude mountain gravel done right. This isn't a flat power race—it's a climbing test at thin oxygen. You start at 7,700 ft (already higher than most people live) and max out near 10,000 ft. If you're from low elevation, your FTP will drop 10-15%. Your breathing will be labored. Your bonk will come faster. The Cochetopa Pass Road climb (miles 30-45) is a 15-mile grind that just keeps going—not steep, but relentless at altitude. The high alpine sections (miles 50-70) are exposed, windy, and stunning—above treeline with panoramic Rocky Mountain views. The Razor Creek descent is technical and loose—confidence-testing. Gunnison is a hidden gem: small town, big mountains, zero crowds. The post-race BBQ in the park is low-key awesome—burgers, local beer, live bluegrass. It's not a corporate expo. It's a community celebration.",

      "bottom_line": "If you want a flat, fast gravel race, look elsewhere. If you want a legitimate high-altitude mountain suffer fest through the Colorado Rockies—Gunni Grinder delivers. You'll either love the altitude challenge or get wrecked by it. Come acclimated, bring low gears, and pack extra nutrition. The views from 10,000 ft are worth the pain. The BBQ at the finish helps, too."
