You start at 7,700 ft (already higher than most people live) and max out near 10,000 ft. If you're from low elevation, your FTP will drop 10-15%. Your breathing will be labored. Your bonk will come faster. The Cochetopa Pass Road climb (miles 30-45) is a 15-mile grind that just keeps going—not steep, but relentless at altitude. The high alpine sections (miles 50-70) are exposed, windy, and stunning—above treeline with panoramic Rocky Mountain views. The Razor Creek descent is technical and loose—confidence-testing. Gunnison is a hidden gem: small town, big mountains, zero crowds. The post-race BBQ in the park is low-key awesome—burgers, local beer, live bluegrass. It's not a corporate expo. It's a community celebration.",

The 220-mile route begins in the vibrant town of Gunnison and forms a spectacular loop by traversing the high sage desert to the south before turning north into the Sawatch mountain range.

Landscapes all in\nthis one concentrated place\n[Music]\nso Gunnison County is a large Geographic\nCounty it's about one and a half times\nthe size of Delaware but 80 percent of\nthe county is federal public lands a lot\nof kind of the race Pioneers uh have\nlived in this Valley and Gunnison and\nCrested Butte and so the presence of\nbike packing has always kind of been uh\nnoticeable here and also when we look at\nthe vast amount of public lands here\nbiking has a prominent spot on the\nlandscape and the ability to connect\nsingle track and double track in lots of\ndifferent uh connections to different\nland use really exist in a way that bike\npacking uh is really a natural fit we\nmade Gunnison County our home basically\njust because of all the public land we\nhave access to we have 800 miles of\nsingle track we have millions of Acres\nof public land I mean the first time I\never came through here was like 1990\nfour I think but gunnison's a pretty\ncool town now like actually spending\ntime here\nand using it as a jumping off point what\nis it 35 of all gravel roads in Colorado\nare in Gunnison County it's pretty\namazing I think\ngonna eat because we have so much access\nto all all these mountains many\ndifferent unique mountains there's the\nkochetopa hills there's the Elks you can\nget like the very dramatic mountains\nwhere you can get the Rolling Hills and\nof course the Great Divide mountain bike\nride a edge of the Colorado Trail those\nconnect through and then there's tons of\nroutes that have just kind of been\nspread as Word of Mouth routes a lot of\nsub 24-hour overnight opportunities in\nand out of Gunnison and Cresta Butte and\nso the the ability to just continue to\ncurate routes that are unique and\ninteresting and have a large appeal\nwhether it's historic or whether it is\nthe ability to get high up in the Alpine\nterrain or down in the lower Sagebrush\nterrain really the the possibilities are\nUnlimited in Gunnison County just my\nfavorite thing about bike packing is\njust being able to explore all these\ntowns and trails that you would never be\nable to otherwise and it's a great way\nto see a place intimately and get to\nknow a place whether you're traveling or\nwhether it's your backyard\nthe root is called sage and Saddles the\nGunnison bike packing loop it's a 220\nmile Loop that starts and ends in\nGunnison Colorado and I'm lucky enough\nto call this home and be able to Pedal\nthis route from home but what I really\nwanted to do is share this awesome\nunique diverse landscape of Gunnison\nCounty while also highlighting the\narea's history the natural beauty and\nthe culture the variety and the\nprogression of the route because we\nstarted in the sagebrush climbing\napartment rocks you know you had these\nbeautiful Canyons kind of sprawling\nVistas you saw the mountains in the\ndistance and then we rounded the corner\nstarted coming back North\ntowards the mountains and then we were\nin them I haven't been on too many\nroutes we're in such\na small distance or length of time\ncovered such varied terrain so the first\nhalf of the route the southern part\ndefinitely has a distinct feel less\nresupply maybe more desert-like but once\nyou get to Cathedral Ranch cabins it's\nlike a Oasis in the middle of nowhere\nwhich is really special\nand then you make your way up north in\nthe mountains and you've got all these\ntiny little towns and resupply points\nscattered about which really makes the\nresupply logistics a lot easier but it\nalso gives the root a little bit more\nflavor going about the route and the\ndirection that we ended up\nchoosing to do the route was beneficial\nbecause coming from the Eastern United\nStates where I live at an elevation of\n2500 feet coming to Gunnison in the\nfirst places is quite\na significant elevation and it was nice\nto have a couple of days to sort of ease\ninto that yeah I think a five-day\nitinerary actually works really well so\nfor us it gave us a what was it 44 mile\nper day average going in that\ncounterclockwise Direction really sets\nyou up for Success because you're\nstarting in lower elevations with easier\nriding before making your way around the\nroute to the north where you find\nyourself in more higher elevation you've\ngot more technical riding over those\nmountain passes\nthank you\nfor me it's the passes you know Williams\npass was super cool we saw three baby\nelk at the top of Williams pass that was\nneat 10 cut pass was cool as well but\nalso I mean that juxtaposed with those\nlong open gravel roads that you had you\ncould basically see you know eight\ndifferent mountain ranges in every\ndirection yeah the Highlight for me in\ngeneral was the Flora started out the\nroute in the sage just has a beautiful\naura about it but then as you work your\nway up going through the pines and then\nthe Aspen and then when you get to the\nwildflowers it's just unbelievable I\ndon't think I've ever seen such a\nvariety of flowers and such\na compact space\nPitkin was cool because when we got\nthere it was the morning\nthere weren't a lot of people in town we\nwent we had breakfast and then we talked\nto Don I believe he's in his 90s\nand Don told us a lot of stories so to\nme that was that was kind of special I I\nwould say maybe my favorite and maybe\nit's a little bit more underrated on\nthis route is that Spring Creek carmel's\nan almond area it definitely offers a\nunique riding experience here in canyons\nand then you open up to the Almont\ntriangle and you're just you've got\nthese great views and Vistas plus\nharmels and almond I mean there's\nEndless Options for resupply there's\ntons of food there so that's a really\ncool and unique experience people know\nColorado is the birth of mountain biking\npeople know that Colorado is a\ndestination for riding bicycles of All\nSorts but this county has everything you\ncan want in a five-day package that is\ngonna answer every question you have\nabout riding bikes\nin the style that we like to ride bikes",

        "search_text": "The Gunni Grinder takes place in Gunnison County, Colorado, which contains 35 percent of all gravel roads in Colorado and is 93% public land surrounded by BLM and forest service areas. Riders face significant altitude challenges, with the elevation requiring several days of acclimatization for those coming from lower elevations. The course features dust and technical sections throughout, with very varied terrain that progresses from sagebrush areas with sprawling vistas and distant mountains to riding directly in the mountains themselves. The route offers a great mix of road surfaces across this varied terrain. Gunnison County provides 800 miles of single track and millions of acres of public land access, making it an ideal location for challenging gravel racing with dramatic elevation changes and diverse landscape features."
