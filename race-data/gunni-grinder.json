You start at 7,700 ft (already higher than most people live) and max out near 10,000 ft. If you're from low elevation, your FTP will drop 10-15%. Your breathing will be labored. Your bonk will come faster. The Cochetopa Pass Road climb (miles 30-45) is a 15-mile grind that just keeps going—not steep, but relentless at altitude. The high alpine sections (miles 50-70) are exposed, windy, and stunning—above treeline with panoramic Rocky Mountain views. The Razor Creek descent is technical and loose—confidence-testing. Gunnison is a hidden gem: small town, big mountains, zero crowds. The post-race BBQ in the park is low-key awesome—burgers, local beer, live bluegrass. It's not a corporate expo. It's a community celebration.",

The high alpine meadows sections offer zero shelter above treeline where thin air meets mountain grades."
