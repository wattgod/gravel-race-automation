          "transcript": "so welcome to my second part of finding\noff peace trails at holden forest\nso this is one down here which i'm just\nabout to go down\nand there's five parts to it as i know\nit's quite\nhard to find off peace trails sometimes\nand you don't know where they lead\nso hopefully this video will give you\nthe confidence to go off and explore\nmore off-piste trails so the trail that\ni'm going to be riding today\nis just off the side of the kittens\ntrail the blue trail\nand it weaves in between all the trees\nand\nthere's an easy way uh up at the top\nwhich comes down and that will join just\nonto the kittens if you don't want to go\ndown to the further\nthe kittens because some people might\nwant to do that really nice\nflowy uh open area of the\nkittens trail so this\nis the first section of the trail it\nfollows right along the kittens trail\nis quite flat and you have to keep\npedaling otherwise you're gonna stop\nquite quickly personally i'd say the\nkittens trail is a lot quicker\nas it's straight downhill but this one's\nreally fun\nit's short and it's good to warm you up\nif you're a bit cold good morning\nokay keeping going\nand still pretty rooty\nslightly steeper and loads of driving\ntraces\nit's really roofy\nquite slippery especially\ni can just fill my room sliding\neverywhere\nso continuing down the trail we don't\nhave much more\nuntil we go into the more really\ntechnical\nsections so soon you have the choice\neither to go straight on\nand continue with the really off-piste\nsections which gets\num slightly more technical or you can\neither just follow the rest of the\nkittens depending on what you want to do\nokay\nokay so this just comes out and misses\nan\nuphill and a downhill on the blue\npersonally i think this is one of the\nbest options\nas here's the blue and it just goes\nstraight down there\nand that's into the open section which\nis quite nice\nand that's really fun down there or\nthere's another section which you might\nsee in this film on my next film\nwhich is straight down there\nand that's a pretty nice section as well\nif you keep going straight on it's\nperfectly fine and you're not going to\nfind it too hard to lose the track\nas that is the main blue trail if you\nturn\nright off the blue trail then\nit's slightly harder but i'm going to\ngive you full directions on how to find\nit\nand also i'm going to link my strava\nright that i did down below so then it's\neasier to find especially if you're out\nthere\nso what some of you might be wondering\nis how to find\nthat section so if you keep going along\nthe blue trails this is after the uphill\nthis will be and soon you'll see we'll\ncome up to the section\nopen section of the trail so here is the\nbig open\narea which you usually find on the trail\nnow let's continue on the point of no\nreturn\nfor about half a mile or a mile\nso this section isn't too hard it starts\noff\nquite easy and then gets harder and then\nonce it's got harder it goes back to\nbeing easy\nso again here i'm going to take the\nright board\ninstead of the left fork and this is the\nsecond\njunction and they're pretty close to\neach other so you can't really miss it\ntoo much\nnow let's continue down the rest of the\ntrail\nokay so down here there's some really\nnice\npump pumps they're quite bitter this is\na really fun section i find personal\nthey're not too big but\nit's really pumpy and you can get some\ngood speed\nif you're pumping enough but sometimes\nit is slightly harder to pump\ndepending on the weather and how it is\nthat day\nso after the pumps you have this steep\nroller down which isn't too technical\nyou just want to make sure you don't go\nto the handlebars and don't\nslide out because it wouldn't be the\nbest place to\nwhen you're going down here all you need\nto make sure is you're taking the right\nline\nand you're far enough back on the bike\nthat you didn't go over the handlebars\nand if you're on a full suspension bike\nyour suspension\nsettings aren't too low\nso now we're going to go up this fire\nroad\nfor about 100 meters\nand then we're going to turn left off\nthe track\nso from the main track you want to turn\nleft\noff to this section which is down there\nand then there's a\nfork in the trail where you can either\nchoose to go left\nor right left is probably if you're not\nso good at riding\nit gets rid in less and is less\nright as if you want a bit more\nchallenge and\nthere's a few jumps on the right and\nsome steep berms\nso it doesn't matter which way you pick\nbecause they all end up at the same\nplace\nstraight away you can see the fall and\ni'm going to go right\nokay so\nnow taking the off piece trail\nit's slightly rooted in places and it's\nquite flat here\nso i'm gonna build up some speed\nand then here you go straight on\nso this section you want to continue\nstraight on on the path\nyou'll be able to tell because it looks\na bit more\nrutty and like cyclists have been there\nand it's in line with the other track\nthat you came from\nokay so continuing down the trail\nit's pretty\nso now the trail is starting to get a\nlittle bit more technical\nand slightly steeper so you can see one\nof the steep sections of the trail\nand there's a mini jump which you can do\nnear the end it's only optional\nso it is now pretty steep and it's\ngetting steeper\nas you can see\n[Applause]\nso here's some many small jumps which\nyou can take going along the trail\nnow we're coming up to one of the most\ntechnical sections of the trail\ntwo big drops or very steep\nroll downs\nfirst attempt let's see how i do so this\nattempt wasn't very good\nand i basically sat on the saddle\n[Music]\nsecond attempt let's see how i do\nso this attempt i did it a lot better as\ni didn't sit down on the saddle\nlifted up so now we're coming up\nto it and soon we should just be able to\nsit\nhere is and then straight down\neasily no problems now let's see what\nthe next one's like\nfirst time down perfect\nnot too hard but i definitely found\nthis one harder as it was a lot steeper\nand a lot slippier after\nso here it is from another angle\nnow that we've conquered the two hardest\nbits of the trail\nlet's continue and see what the rest of\nthe trail is like\nbut not too far yet so this is one of\nthe trickier features on the trail\nyou can either jump over it or you can\neither roll down it it's quite hard to\nroll down it so if you\nwant to roll down it keep your weight\nback jumping\nyou need some skill to jump over it but\nif you can\njump over it i think it's a lot easier\nso in this gully is quite slippy as all\nthe sides have been worn away\nand then when it gets a lot open you can\npick up some good speed\nbut mud is quite slippy and you might be\nable to see\nthis section it gets a bit all the mud\nflicking up by myself\nbut otherwise it flattens out a lot more\nquite\nand now we're pretty much back at the\nblue\nso here you can see where both trails\nmeet\nyou can see the easier less technical\none on the right\nand the harder more technical one on the\nleft and there's me down there\nso now the trial goes straight down\nthere and then pretty much 50 meters\nafter that you go straight back onto the\npuddings\nand you can follow it going no right\nways\nalong the trail from where we are\ncurrently here we are back at the\nkittens and now we can go and enjoy the\nrest of the ride\nthank you for watching this video make\nsure to like and subscribe and i'll see\nyou in my next video\nyou",

be racing or not\ndepends on what's at the feed station\nwell we're out for a laugh today\nhopefully the rain will stay off uh\napparently Mark's a bit jinxed he's been\nbringing the rain to nearly every ride\nhe's been on but we've got uh 50 miles\ntoday of gravel it's about 50 gravel 50\noff-road a few 20 climbs we are gonna\nhave a laugh watching everybody else\nsuffer whilst we're enjoying ourselves\nshould be fun you boys all excited\nwe've just heard this bacon and egg\nrolls at the feed station\nthat's our race\nI want to imagine that John\n[Music]\noh\nI'll get over features Brooke\noh I wouldn't prefer to go that way\nI was going to look at the little horses\nall right so far it's been a good mix\nI've rode and gravel\nthrough the forest and around the\nRacecourse and it's so far it's\ninteresting to see that the gravel bikes\nand the mountain bikes are both faster\non their own particular\nsurface so we're chewing and throwing at\nthe minute so it's a good laugh so far\nI try my best\nsorry\nwe fast we're there I can't even speak\nwe pass some people there boys that was\na war\noh you enjoy that I did\nno there's several people walking\nso\nthat is as steep as they come I think\nburied my fears\nand we scattered like trees\nsometimes in life\nbut I'm down all the time\nlet's\ntravel by trouble by trouble my trouble\ntoo late\ndo not seal mark\nyeah\nthere's a slip oh he's a big slit yeah I\ncould try a plug\nI'm actually kind of relief we're gonna\nget a breather because that was a bit\nfull on that last bit we went through a\nbridal way which was just all mud it was\nlike\ncycling through tree courses wheel\nspinning everywhere\nyeah past building bikes had a had a\ngirl on another track fall over in front\nof me so I had to stop get off and get\ngoing again and then uh back into the\nforest where it's a little bit more my\nplaying field but as a caught up Mark\nI just got sprayed with all his uh\nsealant\nwhereabouts is the bacon and egg rolls\nit's nearly time for breakfast\nplease\nbefore\nokay it's up there it\nyeah we missed the turning\ntwo of you to go through the treacle I\nnever even seen the sign\nthere's no signs though is there my\nphone in your bag yeah little shape at\nthe top what\n[Laughter]\nI can't see anywhere it goes yeah\nit's up there is it was yours\nit does perhaps that's where they've\nchanged it we got the old groups yeah\nyeah well we're gonna go in the bad part\nthen aren't we I don't know what was it\nlike that's messy there if we don't\nroute really well no never mind I don't\nknow yours is going back now John Wayne\nsaid left up there can you scream\nthere with us we'll get back to you when\nwe're on\nwe're on the correct room when we find\nout where it is everybody's got\neverybody's room\nall right we'll find it\nforeign\nand I deal with it\nuh\noh Jesus Oh wet feet\noh no\noh for it\noh no don't stop\nI must say I'm looking forward to the 50\non Road\nlet's open off-road every time we've got\na road it's gone up a 25 clone\nhey where we've been\napproved 20 20 miles 20 miles you're\nhaving a laugh that's 50 surely\nElla it's really nice Steve\nwhat flavor is that though\nsounds more chocolate than kosher well\nwe finally found a feed stop\nhandsome Road and we're heading on\nto the next feed stop which apparently\nis the one with the egg rolls and the\nbaker rolls and all the nice food so\nwe're going off-road I can just see on\nthe map there's a Broadway sign\nand it says turn right\nnothing bad yesterday\noh my\nGod\nwould you like to tell your viewers what\nhappened\nI've got a concerned look on my face\nspiky\nnon-existence well I've just cleaned\nmine off with that last puddle so I'm\nall right now so when he put in his\nemail yesterday it's dried out and\nthere's hardly any mud\nyeah we weren't on the roads long enough\nthough now we turned off into a bog all\nright found ourselves a bike path now\nbut I've also just noticed\nI've lost my glasses when I fell off so\nthat's not good\nbut there's no way I'm going back\nthrough all that water and mud and\ntreacle just for a pair of glasses\nbut if you find them let me know\nokay I shot you without more in the\nbackground Mark oh at least gonna have\nto go up there today\nbut every time we seem to hit a road we\nhit another steep climb yeah\nthe cracker that one I like the bike\npath though that was nice yeah oh we\nstill haven't found the cafe though so\nhoping somewhere down at the bottom of\nthis hill we've just earned a nice\ncoffee or something to eat\nyou don't expect to find a flood on the\ntop of a hill\n[Applause]\nfor the light that is\na hundred times\nremember\nI keep looking forward to the road pit\nwhen we're getting all the Mucky stuff\nand then we're just coming up these\nridiculous climbs and it's still still\ngoing up Heavy Truck Lines\nat least most of the climbs our road\nthe only flap that we've done is that\nbike path I think yeah\nyeah that was nice yeah that was nice\nyeah it wasn't the um the right right to\nbring brand new pair of shoes on was it\nMark\num\nstarting to feel it John\nyou're starting to feel it\nyeah yeah I know what you need\nyou need a hero you're holding out for a\nheld in here or to the end of the ride\nsomething like that yeah we'll give a\n250 watt motor\nhe's marked put his cape on\nyou might put his cape on yeah\nyeah a bit messy\nall right we're starting to believe that\nthat Cafe stop was gonna be a mirage and\nthey'd lied to us but we found it\nbut guess what\nwe're back on the road\nthen going back up another short Steep\nHill\nwe've got about 18K to go\none big climb I've got on my wahoo\nSteve is saying we've got three more to\ngo\nso I'm hoping Wahoo is Right

much slop\nEd at the mall cause your mama forgot\nall his claims go that was an absolute\nPig\nbut we've got some Forest track again\nnow\nhopefully it can't be too much more up\nthat\nit was a

          "transcript": "I'm not even putting it on\nah\nmorning\ntired\nah yesterday I was riding the um Stone\nCircle route up in Wiltshire with the\nguys from hot chili and the pace was\npretty spicy at points and it was super\nmuddy so you'd be putting out so much\npower and hardly going anywhere so we\ndid about 95k it took us about five\nhours we had a lot of very fine Pizza\nit's a good day out but then I had to\ndrive back to Devon and as a result I'm\npretty tired I also find that like when\nI've done a lot of exercise I can't\nreally sleep you'd think it'd be the\nopposite but sort of like fires up my\nlegs or something I get like fizzy\nTwitchy legs at night and I'm really\nreally restless that happens super bad\nif I do a late night turbo session but\nyeah suffice to say I've not slept very\nwell anyway I'm up bright and early I'm\nup at Holden uh racecourse where I'm\ngonna be riding my friend Ben's gravel\nsporty the Holden heroic I'm going to be\ndoing the long route which in sort of\nmodern gravel terms doesn't sound super\nlong it's 85k and\num for instance when I'm racing in\nGirona I'm doing 200k ditto when I race\nin Iceland uh but firstly this isn't a\nrace it's a sport Eve secondly\num in England like gravel roads aren't\nlike they are in other places this 85k\ncould be really really slow We tend not\nto have loads of those fast flowing\ngravel roads uh that you see in all the\nfootage of gravel riding coming from\nAmerica uh there's a few in Kill the\nforest and stuff like that I'm not\nsaying they don't exist but they don't\nexist around here so uh the 85k might\ntake quite a long time also my legs are\na bit tired anyway I must get on I've\ngot to get my\nnumber two they give you numbers I guess\nthey do got to get my number get all my\nsnacks sorted out and then I will show\nyou more of the lovely area where I live\nbecause this is my local stomping\ngrounds\nstay by me\n[Music]\nso I've loaded the course on my Garmin\nit's self-navigated but I think some\nbits have got signposts and Marshalls\nand whatnot says that it's\n83.42 kilometers uh\n1282 meters of elevation and the time\nthat it suggested it will take me is six\nand a half hours\nI mean I don't want to say it I think I\ncan do it quicker but that seems quite\ngenerous am I gonna regret saying this\nI'm going to regret saying this anyway\nI'm not racing this it's not a race it's\na small D for equally I did a big ride\nyesterday and I just want to go and have\nsome fun I'll probably stop for cake so\nyeah let's go well I hope they don't\nfollow me seeing as I always get lost\nthis is fun currently zooming around\nHolden Forest this is one of the trails\nthat I ride with my daughter\nit's way quicker on the gravel bike\nswear to God\nI want to come back when I'm not filming\nand see how quickly I can do it\nit's a really good Forest Park and you\ncan just come and ride here\nfor well you can ride for free if you\ncycle here\nbut yeah if you drive\nyou don't have to pay an entrance fee\njust pay to park I think it's a good\ndeal they've done good work here isn't\nthat nice\nI really feel like I should know where\nwe are seeing as\nwell\nI live around here\nbut this route is so good\nbut I don't even know all these trails\nor trying to anyway\nthank you\ncry\nokay\nI'm having a little bit of trouble here\nbecause my wheel keeps collecting modern\nleaves and then it won't even turn\nso as if you weren't having to put down\nenough power to get through this mod\nI've got I've basically got the brake on\nthe problem is there's loads of\nclearance\nfor a big tire between the seat stays\nbut um or crikey\nI don't ever do this one-handed\num\nbut\nmud keeps getting tracked behind but in\nbetween the rear wheel and the down tube\nokay Scrabble bikes aren't designed for\nthick thick thick mud\nso\nthe fat tires\nfit\nperfectly nicely in the frame\nunless\nyou're riding in this\nhuh that's handy\nmy course has disappeared I'm just\nreloading it\ncome on come on come on I'm going back\nthere\nwhere am I gonna go are you doing the\nbig one\nit is okay thanks\nyay\noh mud\nboo\nready across a slightly flooded pretty\ncommon\nwhich means\nwe are quite high up I mean I could have\ntold you that from all the climbing\nwe've dust just done\nbut more importantly it means we should\nhave some fun descends and look there's\nreal gravel not just mud\nOh I thought I just heard the dreaded\nhiss\nof a tubeless tire puncturing but I\nthink fingers crossed it was just\nsomething getting stuck in my wheel\nI think it's up here slightly\ndisconcerted that those other people\ntook a different\nfruit\nfingers crossed\nthey've got it wrong rather than me\nI'm sorry if that sounds mean I just\nmean I don't want you've got it wrong\nit's so slippery\nwe've only done 30k but it's been quite\na Savage 30k so I'm ready for this\nthis one really nice to not just have\ncake and energy bars I know I was saying\nearlier that I found some cake but once\nyou've been drinking carved drink and\neating\nenergy bars and all that sort of thing\nfor an entire ride which I was doing\nyesterday too\nnice to have something savory\noh\ncrikey that is deep\n[Applause]\num I mean\nI guess my face are kind of already wet\noh my God\nthis is the second feed zone for the\nlong route\nbut I don't know if I deserve anything\nbecause\nI have figured out that I've\naccidentally skipped a bit of the route\nI was just right\naccidentally\nleaking on this giant puddle and then\napparently there was a right turn and I\nnoticed my Garmin rerouting but I didn't\nknow why and I just carried on going\nanyway then I bumped into some new\nfriends Ross over here\nand I was like where are those people\ncoming from as a bunch of women rode\ndown a muddy Bridal way Well turns out I\nmissed that bit but I'm not going back\nI'm gonna have a cup of tea and then\nfinish this thing off hello hello\nforeign\nwell for the tracker which is 200k\nin a couple of weeks\nand we're gonna have a southern sudden\nsurgeon Fitness before then\nI don't think so oh nice\nnice\nlook that was a horrible climb but now\nwe're up\nand anyway I shouldn't complain as soon\nas I missed out one of the climbs\nearlier\nwhat am I moaning about I believe\nyesterday's five hour ride she must be\nthat\nback\nI'm so tired actually after yesterday's\nride as well but that was pretty good\nfun it was really nice to run into Roz\nwho I haven't met before but she's\nfriends with friends of mine and has\njust moved closer to where I live\nrecently so it's nice to get to meet her\nand to ride with her and her friend\nslightly embarrassing as I went over the\nFinish Line Ben shouted out on the\nloudspeaker and here comes Juliet\nElliott she has broken the five hour\nbarrier of the mega course\num but I didn't did I because I missed a\ntiny bit checked with my mates and I\nshould have done 80\n80 so 81 or 83 kilometers I'm not sure\nand I did like 74 75 or something\nso yeah there's that anyway good news I\npacked my jet wash today so I can clean\nthat disgusting bike and it's a pretty\ncool jet wash it was a present for my\npartner for Christmas so you're\ninterested in that I I kind of think\nit's really cool so I'm going to show\nyou\nhere it is\npretty cool provider you've charged the\nbattery\nSam did say it was charged providing the\nbattery is charged all you do is you\nstick the hose end in a bucket of water\nany water doesn't need to be sealed you\ncan just scoop water out of a stream or\nwhatever and put it in this\nexpandable collapsible bucket that comes\nwith it and then um there's this sort of\nchamber thing that you can fill with\num washing stuff I'm being very\ntechnical here with my descriptions you\ncan put washing stuff in here and then\nit um squirts foam when the bikes clean\nit so pretty rad let's give it a go\nit's pretty good right I know this video\nis not sponsored by them I just like it\nanyway I am not going to film myself\nwashing my entire bike not least because\nit means I have to do it with one hand\nwhilst I hold the camera so I'll say\ngoodbye thanks for inviting me along Ben\num check out the link below if you want\nto see the other events that Ben puts on\nthat's it from me uh what's next what is\nnext oh next I'm going to go back to\nfinish off the bit of the East Devon\ntrail that I had to bail on last year\nbecause I had a mechanical Laura's bike\npacking the whole bit so I'm just gonna\ndo the bit from Ax Minister that I\ndidn't do last time so that should be\nfun we're gonna camp out overnight eat\nfish and chips and generally have a good\ntime as we always do so tune in for that\none and uh yeah hope you're doing well\nI'll speak to you later bye",
