        "explanation": "With a field of 100-150 riders, george Thomas won the eBike Medio category while riders like Dibbs bring their sons for family participation.

Chip timing, GPX files, feed stations, and finish line support deliver solid basics without premium pricing. Free parking at the racecourse saves you money, and three distance options mean you're not paying for more race than you want."
