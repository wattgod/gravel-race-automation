The Haute Route brand built its reputation on the Alps road sportive covering legendary Tour de France climbs like Alpe d'Huez and Col du Galibier, but they haven't launched a gravel version. You're paying premium prices for a brand name that doesn't translate to gravel credibility."

        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "The organizational backbone exists from their Alps road events, which are described as the 'pinnacle of granfondo/sportive events.' But without confirmed race details, aid stations, or cutoff times for any gravel format, you're betting on potential rather than proven execution. The road version offers multi-day hotel stays and professional logistics, but gravel demands different infrastructure entirely."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "If this theoretical event follows their Alps model across iconic European mountain passes, you'd get legitimate alpine suffering with postcard views. The road version hits passes like Col de Sarenne at 1993m and Col du Glandon at 1924m - translate that to gravel sectors and you have something memorable. But you're buying a fantasy until they prove they can deliver gravel infrastructure."
      },

        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "The road Haute Route attracts riders seeking that 'pro-cyclist lifestyle taste' - serious amateurs with deep pockets and deeper delusions about their abilities. Without confirmed gravel events, there's no actual community yet, just spillover from the road scene. You'll get the same type A personalities, just arguing about tire pressure instead of aero wheels."

      "field_depth": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "No confirmed participant numbers or competitive field data exists because this gravel event appears to be theoretical. The road version draws serious amateur talent, but gravel racing requires different skills entirely. Until they actually hold a gravel race, you're guessing whether fast road riders will show up or stay home."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Premium European stage racing with hotel transfers and support for 350 miles means you're looking at serious money - likely €3000+ based on their road pricing model. No confirmed costs exist because the event may not exist, but the Haute Route brand charges luxury prices for amateur races. You pay for the logo, not just the miles."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Multi-day European stage racing with 'several consecutive nights in the same hotel' as their road model suggests means massive logistics costs. Add flights to Europe, accommodations, bike transport, and the premium entry fee, and you're easily hitting $5000+. This isn't a weekend warriors' budget race."
      },
      "length": {
        "score": 5,
        "explanation": "350 miles over multiple days in European mountains is legitimate distance that will break riders. Compare that to their confirmed Alps road version at 808km total - this hits the sweet spot of multi-day suffering without being completely masochistic. The mileage alone separates pretenders from contenders."
      },
      "technicality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "European gravel typically means fire roads and well-maintained surfaces rather than American-style chunky singletrack. If they follow routes parallel to their road climbs like Col du Lautaret and Col des Aravis, expect smooth gravel ascents that favor power over bike handling. This isn't technical riding - it's grinding."
      },
      "elevation": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "30,000 feet over 350 miles delivers serious vertical - that's legitimate alpine climbing density. Their road version hits passes up to 2764m at Col de l'Iseran, so expect sustained climbs above 2000m where your legs and lungs get properly tested. The mountains don't care about your FTP."
      },
      "climate": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Alpine weather above 2000m is unpredictable and potentially dangerous - clear morning conditions can turn to snow or thunderstorms by afternoon. Their confirmed passes like Col du Galibier at 2642m see dramatic temperature swings and weather changes that can trap unprepared riders. Mountain weather demands respect and backup plans."
      },
      "altitude": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Climbs reaching 2000-2700m elevation based on their road course profiles mean legitimate altitude effects for sea-level riders. Not Leadville-level oxygen deprivation, but enough to notice reduced power output and recovery. European alpine passes provide a taste of altitude suffering without requiring weeks of acclimatization."
      },
      "logistics": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Multi-day European stage racing requires complex coordination of hotels, bike transport, and international travel, but no confirmed logistics details exist for any gravel version. Their road events offer hotel transfers and support, but gravel demands different infrastructure entirely. You're trusting an unproven gravel operation based on road racing credentials."
      },
      "adventure": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Multi-day gravel racing through European alpine passes offers genuine adventure - remote mountain terrain where weather and mechanical issues have real consequences. The altitude, distance, and mountain setting create legitimate risk and reward scenarios. But you're betting on an adventure that may not actually exist until they prove they can execute gravel events."
