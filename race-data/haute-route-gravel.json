The challenge lies in gradient and altitude rather than technical descents, though Rupert Guinness noted the Col de la Lombarde descent 'requires constant attention.'

Mark Gilmour had to adjust his refueling strategy after cramping: 'I wasn't replenishing the salts I was losing through sweating and the effort' and added more salt to prevent further issues.

          "transcript": "it's 7:00 a.m. and I'm on the start line\nof the inaugural oats route Oman which\nis a three day event with three stages\ntaking place in the beautiful Green\nMountains of Oman the stage one's about\nstart and well I'm a little bit nervous\n[Music]\nthat's the most difficult climb I've\never done\nthe scenery is absolutely amazing\nyou may be familiar with the oats root\nbut in case you're not here are three\nquickfire facts fact one anyone can\nenter a note root event and they give\nthe opportunity to keen amateur cyclists\nlike you or I to experience a multi-day\nstage race in some of the best riding\nlocations in the world events are either\nseven or three days long Oman is three\ndays and an example of a seven day event\nwill be the Alps which Johnny chocolate\nboys Bevan did a video on before the\nevents are professionally run with loads\nof support including Marshalls\nmotorcycle escorts security neutral\nservice life timing feed stations\nmedical support you get the idea I've\nbeen invited out to do the out route\nOman by the organizers to make a video\nabout my experiences quite frankly I\nleft at the chance now today we have an\n85 kilometer out and back stage\nincluding the fierce of Jebel Akhdar\nclimb and then it's back down to the\nfinish best get cracking\nI'm pretty nervous today because stage\none's going to header Jebel Akhdar which\nis 19 kilometers at 8% which sounds\npretty hard enough on its own but it\nalso features 40 kilometers are quite\nfrankly frightening ten and a half\npercent I mean that striking absolute\nfear into me and also Jenson Button\nformer Formula One world champion is\ntaking part so I'm gonna do my best to\ntry and beat Jenson of our thirties\nquite good many of you will have heard\nof Jenson Button but for those that\nhaven't he's a bloke from a town called\nFroome just down the road from GCN oh\nand he was also the 2009 Formula One\nworld champion and as 15 Grom Prix\nvictories to his name be a bit of a hero\nof mine and I've spent many years\nwatching him race but now is my\nopportunity to race him I certainly\nwouldn't stand a chance in a car but can\nI beat him on a bike the time has come\nto push the button\nwe've just gone over the timing map\nother than you to life section and we're\nabout to hit the bottom slopes the Jebel\nAkhdar\nas if you rather keen people up there\nbut it's a plumbing long time so I'm\njust going to try and rise to power and\npaste it as best I can\nthis crime is absolutely ridiculous you\nknow it's going to be a tough one when\nin the first 10 meters you've already\nrun our gear Oh seriously steep ramps\n20%\nI managed to drop Jensen but not through\nsheer physical strength you have to\nadjust this saddle so I took full\nopportunity to get a gap\n10k in 9k to go Oh God\nhopefully we're over the worst of it\nthis climb is unrelenting he's like\nnothing I've ever ridden before because\nrunning hot as well it's a real\nchallenge that's the finish there we're\ngoing to go back down here and come back\nto there so don't wait the pasta turn\naround a bit final time check now\nplus 500\nface of it come on - oh man they said\nthey said he fronts you in the out ruse\noh man that's like yeah sounds sounds\ngreat formats I foolishly said yes\nbefore I've looked at the route profile\nan average gradient some of these climbs\nbecause that was that was hard anymore\nto roll over any zonked on any angler\nroof that was a seriously tough time\nhow did see a bucket list if you haven't\nalready so the descent now back to the\nhotel's neutralised\nshe's nice which means I can I rise\nchilled out ride down there stop take\nsome pictures hit back hotel not my\nmassage and just recover ready for\ntomorrow looks even harder I'm here with\nJensen now how did you get on today man\nwell I'm stood here so I did all right\nno it's it's the easiest course today\nwas pretty crazy and racing driver were\nvery good at excuses and I've got lots\nof them I won't bore you with them but I\nhaven't trained a lot but it was it was\nreally good you know it's the great\nthing about Hell Rose you you're\nclimbing the mountain you're all in pain\nand there's so many cyclists everywhere\nand you're all having a chat mostly\nwinching but it was it was really really\ngreat experience I found that climb\nsalvaged but I'm happy it's over yeah\never done and so I'm looking forward to\nthe stage tomorrow yeah it's a big flap\nin the end stage to get out room on\nshould be should be a lot of fun so this\nflat and then you climb and then turn\naround on you and then the descent isn't\ntimed so we'll take that easy get a nice\nbig group and then the will sprint in\nright we will yeah 31st at the moment I\nthink 30 seconds so I want to be 27th\nbecause it's top 10 I'm currently seeing\na 16 an evil it he's gonna blow up\nhe's definitely gonna blow so there you\ngo Jensen found it hard and I found it\nhard it was proper art and tomorrow\ndoesn't know much easier either 145\nkilometers including a 22 kilometers I'm\nat jebel Hat of\n- 2000 meters and then after that was\ndescent and a fairly flat running to the\nfinish which is about 50 kilometers long\nso can I looking forward to that bit but\nI'm really tired so I'm gonna go to bed\nnow see you tomorrow\nfor the event I've selected this\nlightweight very splendid orbea Orca it\nactually belongs to psy he's kindly\nagreed to let me borrow it on the return\nI don't scratch it it's not a single\nscratch don't worry sigh she's in good\nhands\nnow my choice of this bike is very\ndeliberate rather than an arrow bike or\na disc brake bike now the demands of the\nevent is such that a narrow bike can\ngive an advantage on climbs that are\nsort of 5% and below but the climbs here\nreally steep so a lightweight bike wins\nout also with regards to disc brakes the\ndescents in the oak roots are actually\nneutralized for safety which is cool and\nit also means that well there's not\nreally an advantage to be had from disc\nbrakes on the descent because you can\ntake all the time in the world and enjoy\nit\nso rim brakes win out because the time\nsections uphill overall this bike weighs\njust six point seven kilograms as you\nsee it here also got a compact chain set\nand a 32 through set at the back we've\nquite like a 32 but didn't have time to\nfit one although lightweight is my\npremier consideration I still need to\nthink about Aero because there is a time\ntrial on the final day and also a flat\nsection on stage two so with that in\nmind I've gone for the four five fours\nfrom zip because they're super fast and\nalso sighs got an arrow handlebar on\nthere as well\nevery stage of you get a little stage\nstick there that you can put on your top\ntube and it has all the key information\non there like when the climbs come when\nthe time sections are where the feed\nstations are that sort of thing so I'm\ngonna stick stage to sticker on my bike\nnow from the top tube\nso the way today's stage is I've been\nthinking about tactics I reckon it's\ngoing to stay together until the bottom\nof the first big climb and then I'm just\ngonna time trial up there at my own pace\nand try and get up as quick as I can\nthen the dissent is neutralized and so\nI'm gonna try and regroup with a group\nof guys so that for the final running\nwhich is time be about 50 kilometers I\ncan sort of have a few wheels to sit in\nand save some energy and it'll be faster\nthan time travelling on my own so that's\nthe plan I see if I can do it\nit's a little bit of crosswind on this\nopening section say I'm keeping myself\non the left-hand side of the pack I'm\njust trying to keep as much shelter as I\ncan it save energy\nI've got about 12 minutes on Jensen from\nday one so I want to try and maintain or\nextend that gap but I mean not cracking\non this first time we just got through\nthe incredible medieval village of TANF\nbut it's 400 year old buildings home on\nhave some amazing history here and so\ncool to see\n[Applause]\njust start at the climb of chair Bell\nhat but a few people get quite hard at\nthe bottom I'm going to let them go\nI know what power I can do and I'm going\nto do that try and pace it\nlook at the scenery is absolutely\namazing\nnearly gave to the top hey it's downhill\nbut the visas screwing me on huh look at\nthat when it's like that it makes all\nthe pain worth it\njust got to the top of the climb jebel\nhat and I really enjoyed that one it\nsuited me a lot better than the really\nsteep one yesterday and it had quite a\nfew sort of ramps in it where I could\nsort go a bit harder and then recover\nand that kind of suits me I think did\nalright actually I think I was about\nmaybe I was definitely in the top 10 to\nthe top so it was nice it's a few people\noff but look at this view\nit's absolutely incredible\nit's about 50k running back to the hotel\nnow time and it creep flat with a\ntailwind so we're going to chain gang\nHey\non that last little rice you ran up I\njust got the great those with so now\nsolo TD to the finish it might not be a\nsensible move\narrow helmet was the correct choice\nif you're wondering why I'm in this\ncompromising position it's because at\nthe end of every stage of the ovary\nthere's the opportunity to get a massage\nwhich is cool because it's just like\nwhat the pros experienced in a race when\nthey get a massage after every\nindividual stage - and it certainly\nhelps with your recovery as well it\nfeels really good afterwards the\ndifference is if you do it you don't\nhave to be filmed when\nI'm just chilling in the hotel after\nstage 2 which was really hard but really\nreally awesome it's always cool riding\nhard like pushing yourself back to back\n2 days it's not something I tend to do\nmuch normally but it's fun because you\ncome which is rewarding because you find\nout quite a bit about yourself when you\ndo that you don't always know how your\nbody's gonna respond but today went\nreally well for me I did pretty well on\nthe climb I think I was maybe so sick\nThor fifth on that massive long climb\ntoday so I'm really pleased to have done\nthat I was a really good ride for me and\nthen the section on the way home which I\nwrote mostly with Jensen we got some\ngood through and off going with some of\nthe guys and that was fun we had a\nstonking sailing though it was great\nriding back with sort of going 60k an\nhour at times for not much power that\nwas just great fun and then ended up\ndoing a bit of time trial and at the end\njust to try and get a bit of extra time\nbut yeah great fun legs are feeling a\nbit tired though but only the short time\ntrial to go tomorrow I'm looking forward\nto it it's been great\nstay free today the time trial so in the\nsearch of ultimate gains got the a\nforeskin sooo on and also going for the\nthe Bell arrow helmet as well there's a\ntwenty arrow or the Isola gave me a few\nseconds on the course and you all the\nhelp I can get\nwhen stopped and now a little bit\nnervous head of the time trial but I'm\ngonna do my best attempt to the time and\ntry and catch this guy that's about 50\nseconds ahead of me in the\nclassification test gave you my back\nJensen's on the start line now about to\ngo he's about a minute ahead of me so\nI'm gonna try my best try catch it\ngo ahead\nme Oh awesome now you did awesome right\nI've tried so hard to catch you we're at\nthe beginning of the climb I could see I\nsaid oh he's got a red arm\nStephanie ollie and then yeah and then\nyou caught me and as I I know he started\na minute behind but I've got getting\nback he made me he pushed me to my oh\nthat's not angry more me time children a\nlong time how did I get on overall I\ncame 12th place once the dust had\nsettled which I'm really happy with but\nthat's not really the point for me I\nmean it's nice to place as high as you\ncan\nif that's your thing but ultimately it's\nabout pushing yourself and feeling that\nsense of accomplishment and exhilaration\nall with the added bonus of having\nlike-minded people around you on\nincredible ropes\njust finished the final stage the time\ntrial and absolutely spent that\nabsolutely phenomenal\nthree days riding and it's been great\nriding with Jensen as well thanks to\nJensen for being part of this video and\ngiving up his time it's much appreciated\nand I really hope you guys have enjoyed\nit it's it's nice to sort of race\nagainst people and compare yourselves\nand one of the things with the O is it\ndoesn't matter if you're in second place\nor three hundredth place you're always\nlooking at the person who's just in\nfront of you and you're thinking I'm\ngonna get you and try and beat that\nperson but yeah it's been absolutely\ngreat and if you have enjoyed this video\nplease like and subscribe and to see\nmore of this absolutely beautiful\ncountry then check out the

          "description": "After my successful attack on Col du Tourmalet in stage 3, I was eager to gain more time the riders in front of me in the GC! On stage 4 of Haute Route Pyrenees we had 2 big climbs of which the last one was really tough: 20km of climbing on Cap de Long! In the first 3 stages I got to know the other riders and it was time to make some friends and choose my battles! My best bet: attack in the descent! \n\nThis is my experience of the Haute Route Pyrenees 2022. Haute Route is the hardest and most complete multi day event you can ride as an amateur cyclist. The stages are very similar to the Grand Tours of World tour Professianal cycists. In this event we raced 5 stages in 5 days, 627km and 15.700m of elevation, starting in Biarritz and ending in Saint Lary. \n\nWatch the 5-episode Documentary this week: \n🍿STAGE 1 https://youtu.be/aHxmp5z3Aek\n🍿STAGE 2 https://youtu.be/TomR1ScSl7Y\n🍿STAGE 3 https://youtu.be/VQgAapzY81A\nFriday Dec 9th: STAGE 4\nSunday Dec 11th: STAGE 5 (final episode)\n\nThe partners of this Documentary:\n►Haute Route (event), Sign up here to receive discount on your 2023 event!

          "transcript": "in his wheel I had to push 450 watts to\nstay in so I shout like in my best\nfriends do some more do some more if I\ndo that for a minute\nI explode and as I'm approaching the top\nI just feel like I I'm reaching my limit\noh\nthat was\nall out oh this killed me\nI pretty much choked at the end\nI really have to take some time\nwhat's up guys what's up cycling\nFanatics welcome back this is episode 4\nof my hot root Pyrenees documentary it's\na five-day stage race here in The\nAmazing mountains of the Pyrenees today\nwas just another epic epic stage where\nmy enemies became my friends and a lot\nof stuff happened I'm here in San Lori\nsulong that's the finishing town of\nstage four and five we're sleeping here\nfor two nights till now we've been\npacking up our bags every day and moving\nfrom hotel to hotel it does take a lot\nof effort I mean packing up your bags\nthinking about tomorrow every\npreparation of the next stage starts\nright after the previous stage and\nactually the food might be the biggest\nFactor\nif you don't eat well the next day\nyou're not gonna perform eating hours\nand hours of sugar on the bike isn't\nvery very nice for your stomach either\nso I had a little bit of an issue today\nokay so bluegrond the dump in the\nrestroom here I'm a big guy so I burn a\nlot of energy so I have to eat between\n800 and 1300 grams of carbs every day if\nyou put that on the table that's a crazy\namount of food right sometimes it is a\nbit difficult to get up to that six\nseven or eight thousand calories a day\nI'm keeping track of that with the eat\nmy right app so far it's going pretty\nwell and I've been able to keep up with\nthese numbers yesterday we were still in\ntarps me and Simon were in the same\nHotel so we try to find some food the\nonly thing we could find was a takeaway\npizza so I had like a massive vegetable\npizza with some tuna and then we went to\nthe rider briefing with information\nabout the next day they'll give you the\nweather to give you the stuff to look\nout for in the in the next stage\ndifficult Parts dangerous Parts they'll\ntalk about the climbs which segments are\nturned which are not and just all the\ninformation you need to know today we\nhad two big climbs again but leading\ninto the first client was 35 kilometers\nof false flat it wasn't flat it was\nslightly uphill then we would go into\nthe orchette which was 10 kilometers of\nclimbing there was a small dip just 4K\ntowards the stop and then we have a long\ndescent the time was neutralized and\nthen we'd have a stretch in the valley\nwhere you really wanted a couple Wheels\nto follow before we would start on the\ncup the long 22 kilometers of climbing\nvery big very tough climb all the way up\nto 2200 meters from 1500 meters and up\nyour power numbers are drastically going\nto decrease the air is thin there's less\noxygen available so you're just not\ngoing to be able to push the same Powers\nas sea level The Descent of that first\nclient was neutral so I couldn't use my\nweapon and it was very important to ride\nsmart today the trick we tried yesterday\nobviously didn't work so it had to be\nsomewhere in between after the writer\nbriefing is always an operative you can\nget a drink you can have a chat with the\nother Riders there's some little bites\nand food and that's where I'm at Carlos\nthe oldest current well I'm not sure I'm\nthe oldest but one of the oldest okay\none of the oldest Riders here in hodruth\n69 years old 69 years old and you've\ndone 15 whole routes pretty much yes\nimpressive when did you start which year\n2012 2012. are you doing like multiple\nevery year I did the Pyrenees\nand they do this here as well wow and\nhow are you enjoying so far today was\nfun it was tough eh it was really dark\ntoday but it was so beautiful yes but\nyou know the problem is when you are in\nsuch space I was looking one meter in\nfront of me I couldn't see anything yeah\nyeah but it was a beautiful day well I\nhope you enjoyed the rest of them we got\ntwo stages to go good luck good pleasure\nthank you\nso after stage three I was sixth in the\nGC a few Riders they climbed up Marco\nmiguela their true climbers so they\npassed me the guy in front of me Sami\nsuper strong guy he's big like me\nyesterday on the two Malay I took a\nminute and a half so now he was only two\nminutes in front of me so I figured if I\ncan do very well on the climbs maybe I\ncan pass him in the GC get me back in\nthe top five for this stage I didn't\nreally have figured out who would be my\nallies and who would be my enemies I\nknew I wanted to get Simon a few people\npeople but how I hadn't decided yet\nI knew the first part was flats are\nthought about attacking but once we were\narriving there I felt a bit of a\nheadwind and I figured it would be\nbetter to just stay in the Peloton and\nget some shelter because it would save a\nlot of energy for those two big climbs\n[Music]\nfrom the gun we go straight into attacks\na lot of guys were pushing left and\nright and it was strung out all the way\nin one long single file line now when\nthat happens to a Peloton you know it's\ngoing hard and I try to stay in the\nwheels I tried to get shelter I try to\ndraft and save my energy as much as I\ncan\nwhat is it like to be playing with the\namateur races\nit's much better it's better than a\nprogram\nwhat's the plan for today\nenjoy\nit's a good plan at some point the\nBreakaway was established three guys got\nup ahead rotating really fast and they\nwere gaining time really really quick at\nthat point the decision was made and I\nwas saying in the Peloton\nwhen you get in the race I think my\nScandinavian friends from yesterday took\noff they've got like a three or four man\nbreak I'm staying with this very big\ngroup to just save some energy I think\nthey're spending more than I'm saving so\non the clients it's gonna go full gas\nthe first part of the climb is all\nslightly uphill so it's beneficial to\nstay in the draft\nso as we were approaching Wolcott the\nclimber started to push more and that's\nwhen the whole Peloton just split up\ninstantly when it falls flat into the\nwind most of the Riders will be able to\nkeep up they say in the draft it's one\nbig group but as we start climbing\nthat's when you see the same Riders\nagain from the day before and the day\nbefore that\nwe have this group of about 10 to 15\nRiders of the top in the GC and we'll\nwork together all the time out of that\ngroup three guys took off they were very\nlight pure climbers and they went up\nreally fast I was not going to stay with\nthem I never do these guys are too fast\nfor me if I would go with them I would\nblow up straight away so I stay with my\nlittle group my homies the guys I've\nbeen riding with for the last three days\nand we went up together and it's not\nlike it's going slow I have to push\nreally hard on these climbs\nso we're right on this on this climb in\nin this sort of a valley very nice views\nand Tom he kind of messed up on the two\nMalay yesterday he completely blew up\nhis legs so now he's riding for will\nthey are buddies so 4K to the top that's\nwhen The Descent starts when it's going\ndown when we're descending there's only\none thing I can do very good and that's\ngo fast I figured I'm gonna attack in\nthis descent who knows what happens so\nthe first part was still straight I go\ninto my super talk I passed these guys\nand then there were a few sharp corners\nand I went through his Corners very\nquick and as the climb started again on\nthe last two kilometers I started\npushing I started hammering it really\nreally hard I was at 400 watts straight\nand the only guy in my wheel was Tom the\nguy that we tried to trick yesterday\nthank you now look back I see Tom on my\nwheel and then there's the group we have\na gap like 50 meters or so so I start\npushing hard boom boom boom boom and\nboom my enemy of yesterday he's actually\na very nice guy he started coaching me\nhe started pushing me like come on\nJasper go go go he took Bulls we were\ngoing up we were smashing it\nall right\nthe tank is about to explode\nlaughs\n[&nbsp;__&nbsp;]\none more corner I push out everything\nover the top the Chrono stops\nand I took 20 seconds on Sami\nI'm off or out\nall out that was\nall out\nfor I did 400 or more because Tom he's\nin front I had to push 450.\noh this killed me\nso the first part of the race was done\nand you know the second part was kind of\na question mark I didn't know what to do\nI spoke to Simon will and Tom apparently\nwill from the Breakaway he made up five\nminutes on everybody else so will and\nTom were now Racing for the stage win\nand they came up with a little plan they\nwanted to wait a little bit recover and\nthen Smash It Down The Valley so I\nfigured if I joined them we would have a\ngood Pace line I told them I was gonna\ngo down the hill to wait downstairs\nbecause it's warmer there's more oxygen\nit's better for your recovery and I\nwould see them down and then before the\nChrono we're gonna take off again\nforeign\nI would actually prefer not to have any\nfollowers neutralized because now you\nget this silly stuff I'm waiting for\nsome of my guys who are still at the top\nand they were supposed to come down but\nI know I don't know where they are and\nthere's massive groups already left but\nI'm not sure how hard they're gonna ride\nso it's a really difficult position\nactually I can break or make my race\nright now so I decided to wait and I\ndidn't have any phone numbers so I found\nTom on Instagram and I called him on\nInstagram like dude where are you uh I\nhave Instagram contact with my buddies\nthey're coming down\nwe're being we're getting ready to smash\nit make up some time climb back up in a\nGC that's the plan I made use of that\nsituation because your stomach sometimes\nstarts to rumble a little bit so at that\nmoment I really had to take a dump\nhere very safe 10 seconds later yeah\nokay so taking a blue Grande dump in the\nrestroom here before we're gonna\ncontinue riding one eternity later\nthere's a climb that's three kilometers\nten percent really Steep and then we go\ndown and then in the valley we rotate we\nmake it fast I've seen big groups pass\nalready man but we have to make it worth\nit\n[Applause]\nbreath\nwe smashed it down the valley we went\nreally hard Tom took big pools because\nhe was helping will to win the stage\nright so we were rotating all of us then\nwe approached the climb of the cup the\nlong and will couldn't keep up so me and\nSimon we took off do you and me Simon\nTT mode I'll pull my flats\nyou take the climbs\nno but they're shallow\nthis climb is super tough I was\nsuffering man they were very very steep\nramps\n18 percent\nSimon he's a very strong Rider man he's\nhe's quite small he's a small kid but he\npushes big Power numbers so every time\nit went up like 9 10 11 12 I was just\nsuffering in his wheel and then when we\nwould go a little bit flat there maybe\nfive percent six percent I would take\nthe pools into the wind and he would be\nbehind me so we were perfectly working\ntogether up this climb\nswitchbacks it was really really cool to\nride up there it was picture perfect man\nthat was amazing the road service it was\nquite bumpy but because you're going\nuphill it doesn't really bother that\nmuch and then almost near the top maybe\none or two k to go there was a small dip\nI told Simon man I'm gonna push hard\nstay in my wheel but he lost my wheel I\ngot a little gap on him didn't really\nintend to do that after that it went\nstraight up very steep again and we both\npushed hard till the end\nthat's really good\njob man we can go faster yeah this is\nthis was it\nthis was Max\nMax effort I think I I cannot go faster\nthan this\nyeah\nchecking the times of today I really\npush out all I had and the guy in front\nof me in the GC Sami I attacked him on\nthe first bar and made up 20 seconds but\nhe did really really strong on this last\nclimb I have to check what the final\nresults are I'll let you know later look\nat this view man\nso what did this whole day mean for the\nGC because after that first climb I lost\ntrack of everything because I didn't see\nmy competitors anymore Sami I talked to\nhim after the race apparently he found\none Rider to smash through the valley\nthey were super quick and then he did\nthe whole Climb by himself this guy is a\nfreaking Beast he got three minutes on\nme no my whole plan of today was\nactually to catch him so yeah I'm still\nin the same spot I'm still on position\nsix but I look at the GC and now I see\nanother guy Jeremy a French dude and he\nwas sort of coming down in the GC and I\nhad only 30 seconds on him so tomorrow\nit's gonna be All or Nothing the battle\nof the week if I make up 30 seconds on\nJeremy I'm in the top five of how brewed\nin appearance stay tuned watch\ntomorrow's race right here gonna see you\nnext time see ya",

to begin\nmy Alpine Odyssey and as Matt enjoyed\nreminding me 896 kilometers and over\n22,000 meters of elevation lay ahead\nfair chunk of that elevation was in\nstore on stage one which I've\naffectionately called the warm up it was\nby no means an easy opening day at a\nhundred and seventy three kilometers\nlong especially with temperatures going\ninto the 30s but the long climb\nstretching away from the Cote d'Azur\nserved as a relatively gentle and\nvisually stunning introduction to the\nAlps Stage two however was set to test\nme to my absolute limit\nare you going today John alright just\ngot to narrow I'm gonna be on the second\nday right in the feet of the top of\ncultivar not bad little climb actually I\nam feeling quite good and so fingers\ncrossed I can keep myself up the years\nword which is the next test on route I'm\ngonna crack on so don't think the time\nlimit is very far away make no bones\nabout if the out route is over it's\nwhether you're aiming to make the podium\nor like me just trying to finish each\nstage is split up into timed sections\nthese will often start in the valleys\nand stop at the top of a climb\nparticularly dangerous to sense will not\nbe timed in the interests of safety\nriders must also make it to the top of\neach climb and the finish by a certain\ntime in order to complete the out route\nwith the heat rising and fatigue\nbuilding on stage two things were\nstarting to get really tough\nthere we are I mean the infamous cold do\nis what it's looking tough we now quite\nnear the back I was actually very lucky\nto call on the support of my fellow\nriders that day to help me up the is\nwhat it was the closest I came to giving\nup all week but I'm so glad that I\ndidn't and as it turns out these minor\nmental blocks aren't uncommon for those\nnew to the out route well there's one\nguy you helped yesterday the he's 71 is\nstruggling with his head uses never\nDonna truth that's one of the things\nthey all do it you really get it right\nthe first time he's never done it and at\nthe bottom of the last climb yesterday\nshe basically went to the Dominican says\nI'm done and so I arrived so happened to\nknow him from while the days before\nreally and so I just told him get on\nyour bike and shove the gel down it sure\nliterally shove the gel and it's not\nimpressed I don't think it choked and\nany good at his bike I don't know if\nthere's a magic thing in the jail for\nanyway he got on his bike the scenery is\namazing you find donkeys on the road you\nfound normal crossing the roads that the\nsenior every now and then you have to\nstop take a picture and go back home\ncertainly went short of scenery on stage\nthree after the day before I was feeling\npretty dead leg but as it turned out\nmore climbing and an amazing 21 hairpin\ndescent of outdoors was the perfect\ntonic\nat the final three station just eight\nkilometers link from the top and the\nlegs are finally coming back here's\nincredible the finale of the stage\noffered a sneak preview of what was to\ncome the following day a short but very\nmemorable time trial up out do it\nmorning guys when it's bright and early\nday for Haute Route time trial date I'm\noff for 8:40 just home to breakfast now\neat a little bit not too much\nit already absolutely stuffed for this\n14 kilometer effort I'm who had to do\nnervously awaiting start the time clock\npretty frail if you start room\n[Applause]\nwith a really nice client today How Tos\nI mean it's on everybody's bucket list\nisn't it absolute classic and I took it\nyou know as easy as I could and the\ninteresting thing we're looking at back\nat my heart rate I barely got out of\nZone two which is quite interesting\nthat's the that's the impact of fatigue\nthat does your body so that's another\nthing I'm learning this week\nso tomorrow Queen stage looking forward\nto it I guess but I know it's gonna be a\ntough day and also a long day three\nmassive major climbs they're all very\nlong and some of it is quite steep but\nyou know just got to enjoy it and you\nknow as a security measure\nI went out to the local store and bought\nan 11 32 cassette so I may get the boys\nfrom maverick neutral service to fit\nthat for me so that's two cassette\nchanges in three days so yeah I'm\nquickly learning the kind of equipment I\nneed to go has survived in the Alps\nunfortunately it wasn't the last time I\nsaw Christoph from Mavic that day\nyep\nOh\nneutral services quickly on the scene\nafter I jammed my chain and thankfully\nall I needed was a push to get going\nagain things like the mechanical support\nthe massages the marshalling the fee\nstations all of which made me feel\nseriously professional throughout the\nweek oh and the fact that I was racing\nwith actual ex pros like EMA Poli albeit\nseveral hours behind her I'll be honest\nI think it's way too much fun I mean it\nit's similar in its pacing bikes it's\ndifferent certainly from a female's\nexperience of pro racing in there you\nbase up massive collars every day and\nour races I'm sure they're improving in\ntheir toughness but you know our\ntoughest race is probably the Giro the\ntotal load and there would be a couple\nof mountain days at best and nothing\nlike the epic stages here so everyone in\nevery position in the race is\nappreciated and they were really there's\nreally every level from basically X pros\nor full-time riders and as very strong\nguys show up right down to people who\nhave really never ridden up a mountain\nbefore and I think that's that's really\ncool and everyone's achievement is\nappreciated and that is really nice and\nI feel like sometimes in bike races and\nthey're super exciting to watch but\nthere's basically one winner anyone else\nas a leader and here everyone everyone\nis kind of a winner in there\neveryone is an amazing team of everyone\nwhat the cold the matter then and 15\nminutes inside the time yeah so made a\nfair bit of time with a bug just very\ngood just tucking into some nice bread\nand hat well beyond more\ngood morning guys it's the start of\nstage 6 it is 5:30 in the morning and\nI'm really feeling the fatigue at the\nmoment but we're weird carry on\nregardless going from Egypt to Mazzini\ntoday yeah we've got the Gran Colombia\nand the zoo plan to come up so by no\nmeans gonna be an easy day\nhow many how many times have you guys\nmade that your mouth challenge we did\nthe hard reboot recalibrate okay let's\ndo this over in friendships that we make\nhere how I roll people cheering one\ndifferential is a collage I mean this\ngives you inspiration for keep going\nwhen you heard in extra\nmorning serene seems like a lifetime\nsay oh my god this is some tequila it is\nalso something that is yeah camaraderie\nI don't like seeing the word beats when\nsomebody's down you shout at him he gets\nup and it starts again and then he gives\nyou left and so that you don't get it\nanywhere else you can do you know\none-day events you can find people that\nare nice but here it's not the same\nthing it's the day after that the guy\nyou help will help you and you're gonna\nhave fun just no chatting to people and\nit's just it's very new it's very unique\nit's really hard and because it's all\nit's very\nnow see\ntoday\nwhat's your name\nI'm sorry ah nice to meet you I'm on the\nway from California Wow\nfantastic you're in good shape finally\nriding strong feeling that's the enacted\nagain it was that camaraderie and\nsupport from people at the side of the\nroad just like Simon that got me to the\ntop of the do plan and the more I\nthought about it the more people I'd\ntalk to it's that feeling of\ntogetherness that brings people here\nfrom all around the world and inspires\npeople to do incredible things like team\nKalam Bello who literally went the extra\nmile for a good cause Bella was\nconceived about six months ago to raise\nfunds for Down syndrome in Cork I'm a\nlocal charity nara's always raise 25\nthousand so far bicycling to full length\nof France from shared burg to me and\nthen three days rest and then starting\nthe whole trip you know so we've good\near there's a guy cut who's cycling just\nthey're all rooting with us so yeah\nthat's how it was nap sort of dreamt up\nfrom there the madness began about three\nweeks ago this is pretty petite now oh\nyeah I'm sure you are big day as well\nit's supposed to be a small David it's\nnot really\nyes yeah\nnot too far from the top of the colder\nku fourth climb of the day we got less\nthan less than 10 kilometers of climbing\nis it yeah\nthat's it improve the last time\nsecretary doubts a bit saddest I've\nalready another week\nHere I am with digits competition winner\njewelry store we both finished local\nhealth today it's how you feelin me yeah\nthere were times this week when I didn't\nfeel that lucky to be the competition\nit's bit of a struggle but it's been a\nfantastic week so thank you all very\nmuch great week great people great event\nwhat was your highlight of the week the\nfavorite cold it's a nice black session\nwhich I enjoyed yeah and now

one last\ntime one last hurrah and hopefully all\nstop raining\nRivera Jules was right not just about\nthe beer it's very hard to convey\neverything I felt during the out route I\ncame in never really having climbed a\nmountain before and as hard as I trained\nit quickly became clear that the event\nitself was another level it's the\ntoughest thing I've ever done in my life\nfor both body and brain but the great\nthing about the out route is that there\nare people around you going for exactly\nthe same thing and it's not long before\nyou're picking your head up again\nsmiling and enjoying the incredible\nscenery this race will test you but the\nmemories the friendships and the immense\nfeeling of pride I've taken from it made\nall the suffering worthwhile if you've\nbeen inspired to take on something like\nthis and I thoroughly suggest you do\nwe've got plenty of tips to help with\nyour training subscribe to GCN if you\nhaven't already by clicking on the globe\nclick down here for how

Riders face challenges like the 19km Jebel Akhdar climb in Oman with 8% average gradient and 20% ramps, and high-altitude Alpine climbs reaching 2200 meters where reduced oxygen significantly impacts power output. The Alps route covers 896 kilometers with over 22,000 meters of elevation gain across multiple stages. Each stage includes timed climbing sections with mandatory time limits riders must meet to continue. Gear recommendations include 50/34 chainrings with 11-28 or 11-30 cassettes for steep gradients. Nutrition becomes critical with larger riders needing 800-1300 grams of carbs daily. Events provide full support including marshals, neutral service, medical support, and rider briefings covering weather, climb details, and safety information. Mental challenges are common especially for first-time participants, but strong community support among riders helps people through difficult moments on climbs."
