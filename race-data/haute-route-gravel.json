        "explanation": "Multi-day Alpine stage racing requires complex coordination, but actual rider experiences show gaps. Maxime Cauchois needed to pre-order nutrition from Gelvio before the event, suggesting limited on-site support. Mark Gilmour noted strict daily time cuts that create DNF pressure, while riders report that official accommodation packages deliver 'acceptable, but barely' hotels with 'sub-par' food according to multiple participants."
      },
      "length": {
        "score": 5,
        "explanation": "350 miles across multiple Alpine stages delivers serious accumulated fatigue. Maxime Cauchois described the toll: 'After 4h already' of riding before tackling the hardest climbs, while juanandresso reported complete leg exhaustion despite 4.3 w/kg FTP: 'By the second or third day of the event, my legs were completely cooked. The delayed onset muscle soreness was intense and felt way beyond what I'd normally experience.'"
      },
      "technicality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Alpine terrain emphasizes sustained climbing over technical handling skills. Maxime Cauchois described Col d'Agnel as 'a tale of two climbs: the first one, that averages about 5% over about 11km, is manageable... [then] 9km at 10% average, with ramps up to 14%.' The challenge lies in gradient and altitude rather than technical descents, though Rupert Guinness noted the Col de la Lombarde descent 'requires constant attention.'"
      },
      "elevation": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "30,000 feet over 350 miles means serious vertical density through Alpine passes. Stage One climbs 'up ski runs and under ski lifts up to the Col de la Croix-de-Coeur overlooking all of Verbier' while Stage Two tackles 'the famous Col du Grand St. Bernard.' The sustained elevation gain through high Alpine terrain delivers mountain suffering."
      },
      "climate": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "High Alpine conditions create physiological demands beyond weather. Mark Gilmour had to adjust his refueling strategy after cramping: 'I wasn't replenishing the salts I was losing through sweating and the effort' and added more salt to prevent further issues. The multi-day exposure at altitude requires constant attention to hydration and electrolyte management across varying mountain weather conditions."
      },
      "altitude": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Climbs reach significant elevation through Swiss Alpine passes like Col du Grand St. Bernard, with routes offering 'incredible views over the Bernese alps, the Rhone river valley, and all the way to Mont Blanc.' The altitude provides noticeable effects for sea-level riders without requiring extreme acclimatization."
      },
      "adventure": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Routes traverse historic Alpine passes steeped in cycling and cultural history. Rupert Guinness described it as 'a ride back in time' through 'mountains steeped in cycling history' where 'passes we tackled read like a brutal week at the Tour de France.' The adventure extends beyond cycling to experiencing the same legendary climbs used in professional racing, following ancient trade routes through iconic European mountain terrain."
      },
      "prestige": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "The Haute Route brand built reputation on road events, expanding into gravel through the acquired Gravel Epic series. Created in 2019 and backed by IRONMAN Group since 2021, it positions itself as 'unprecedented in the cycling and gravel events industry' but lacks the established gravel racing credibility of purpose-built events."
      },
      "race_quality": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Events feature 'Full Mechanical Assistance, Full Medical Assistance, Feed Stations with local products' plus 'photographer, videographers, and drone pilots to capture the Epic-ness.' The unique format times only climbs for competition while allowing social riding between segments, though overall execution depends on translating road event expertise to gravel logistics."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Multi-day format through 'fields and meadows' past 'blackened barns and chalets darkened in alpine sun over centuries' following 'ancient bisses, the ingenious Swiss irrigation systems.' The philosophy promises riders can 'ride like a pro with premium level services' across bucket-list Alpine terrain with professional support infrastructure."
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "The road Haute Route attracts riders seeking that 'pro-cyclist lifestyle taste' - serious amateurs with deep pockets and deeper delusions about their abilities. Without confirmed gravel events, there's no actual community yet, just spillover from the road scene. You'll get the same type A personalities, just arguing about tire pressure instead of aero wheels."
      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "The gravel racing scene splits into 'adventure gravel for bikepacking' versus 'race gravel for those chasing speed and performance' with equipment ranging from 'ultralight climbing machines to aero-optimised speed demons.' E-gravel bikes are permitted, suggesting a broad participant base rather than deep competitive field depth."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Premium European multi-day events with 'half board Official Race Accommodation packages' and full support services mean significant costs. The IRONMAN Group backing and positioning as 'unprecedented in the cycling and gravel events industry' suggests luxury pricing that prioritizes premium experience over value proposition."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Multi-day European stage racing with accommodation packages, international travel requirements, and premium support services create substantial costs. Team entry options and e-gravel bike inclusion suggest accessibility attempts, but the fundamental expense structure of supported Alpine stage racing remains prohibitive for most riders."
