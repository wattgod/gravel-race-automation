Three distance options (70km, 110km, 160km) accommodate different ambitions rather than forcing everyone into the same suffering. The 65-mile user data doesn't match official distances, but any of these options deliver a proper day in the saddle. Similar distance to Crusher in the Tushar."

Less technical than The Mid South."

Similar climate challenges to SBT GRVL."

        "explanation": "Maasmechelen sits barely above sea level in Belgium's Limburg province near the Dutch border.

Lower altitude than Gravel Worlds — no thin-air concerns."

The 1,000-participant field includes 50 Unbound qualifiers, but overall depth remains limited by the event's three-year history and regional draw. Less competitive depth than Almanzo 100."

        "explanation": "€89.95-€104.95 covers three days including camping, multiple meals from paella to hamburger fest, live entertainment, and recon rides. The Unbound qualifier opportunity alone justifies the cost, while weekend programming from prosecco parties to podcast interviews delivers substantial value beyond just racing."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Belgium isn't cheap, and Maasmechelen doesn't offer budget accommodation options beyond the camping they mention. No specific lodging strategy or airport logistics available, which means you're figuring out expensive European travel on your own. The €10 day license fee is a minor annoyance that adds to the nickel-and-diming feel. Higher total cost than Badlands."
