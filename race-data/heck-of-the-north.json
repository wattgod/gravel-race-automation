This is NOT smooth gravel—it's technical, rooty, rocky, narrow-path riding that rewards MTB skills, not just power. If you're coming from flat Midwest gravel races, this will surprise you. 60% of the course is on snowmobile trails: roots, rocks, tight turns, line-choice decisions. You're not just pedaling—you're bunnyhopping roots, picking lines over rocks, and keeping weight centered on loose descents. The fall foliage is stunning—peak color in late September means riding through tunnels of gold, orange, and red along Lake Superior's North Shore. The post-race vibe is classic small-town Minnesota: hot soup, sandwiches, and volunteers who genuinely care. It's a community center potluck, not a corporate expo.",

          "transcript": "hello everyone and welcome to Beth bikes\n[Music]\nI'm Beth an ultra endurance gravel\ncyclist and cross-country skier today\nI'm here to bring you the race\nexperience of heck of the North a gravel\nrace in northern Minnesota mom and I\nspent Friday morning scouting the route\nlooking at the cue cards and maps to\nfigure out where I was going we got to\ngo on some of the gravel roads that I'd\nbe going on the next day\nwe just figured out we're at this corner\non the map\npaved road to paved Road and I'm gonna\ntry and see me here tomorrow yep so it's\nabout mile eight eight and a half is\nwhat the cue cards are saying\nso we are out here this Gravel Road\nlooks pretty good\nand then I get on to this\nI think it looks like\nright over here\nwe can get on without having to like to\nclimb over a fence\njust uh\nbe careful\nand then\ngo here\nit's pretty Solid Ground like I'm not\nsinking in it by any means but you've\ngot grass to deal with that's for sure\ngoes down a little bit\nI might get the bike out and try a\nlittle bit of this so I got on my bike\nriding down the snowmobile trail\nand I came to some water so they were\nnot joking when they said it was very\nwet uh today I'm gonna go\naround it uh looks like over here on the\nright\nI can walk\nwithout getting too wet let's see yep\nokay so if I'm writing it tomorrow\nright side is definitely the place to be\nbut on the rest of this\nseems like the left hand side has had\na little bit more traffic\nand so it's a little more packed down oh\nand here I'm in the Sun and it's all dry\nagain okay\nI just have to do like three miles of\nthis going this way so we'll see what\nhappens one of the points that I came to\non this Trail was a bridge that was\nsuper pretty but the problem was the\nslats went\nsame direction that you were riding and\nso with the 38 millimeter tires that I\nwas riding my tire could fit right in\nthere\nand this is\nbeautiful but\nI could not ride up that\nabout halfway through this section of\nsnowmobile trail\nthis is hard work I just moved that log\nit was sitting right here across the\ntrail so that tomorrow\nI don't have to try and Bunny Hop it\nbecause that just sounds better to me so\nI'm gonna keep going about a mile left\nbut oh this is hard work\num\nit's a little wet\nI know they said it'd be a little wet\nbut\nthat's a lot bit wet\nbecause I'm going squish\nokay so after a little bit of time and\ntrying to figure out how to cross this\nthing I'm taking my shoes off and I'm\njust going to walk through it\nand figure out what I do on the other\nside\noh my goodness that water is so cold\nI made it over there's like three\nseparate ponds or four separate ponds\noh Burr I don't know what I'm gonna do\ntomorrow but that was cold\neverything is laid out and ready for\ntomorrow\non Friday evening my mom and I went and\ndid packet pickup so we got my number\nand my cute cards\nokay there you are and your T-shirt over\nhere thank you thank you very much we're\nin the chaos of getting\nfood all prepped and I am working now on\ngetting my number attached to the front\nof my lunchbox which is what it is meant\nto do\nso my number is attached to the front\ncue cards are in there\nand not all of this is there's other\nsome onions there but cookies weird fish\nroot Leathers burrito Pizza eggs\nsome cookies applesauce\nI think I'm ready\nthen Saturday I started in a really bad\nmood I had been really nervous leading\nup to this race and then in the hustle\nand bustle of getting everything ready\nto go and leaving for the race I forgot\nmy bike shoes and didn't realize it\nuntil we were about five minutes away\nfrom the start line and it was a 45\nminute drive that morning so I'm\ncurrently on the side of the road really\nclose to the start I just set up my bike\nbecause I forgot my bike shoes so my\nmom's going back to the camper and I'll\nprobably disqualify myself to pick them\nup from her at some point during the\nrace but I'm gonna go right over to\nstart my mom and I talked it through and\ndecided the best course of action was\nfor me to start in my hiking shoes and\nmy mom would drive back to the camper\nwhere we were staying pick up my bike\nshoes and meet me somewhere on the\ncourse so I don't know how well I\ncommunicated that on the day of the race\nbut that is what happened and what we\ndecided\nI went down to the start and hung out\nwith some friends for a little while\nbefore the start of the race\noh we will try to start the 105.\nat eight o'clock we'll probably be a\ncouple minutes late\nstanding on the start line ready to go\n[Applause]\neverybody\nand there we have started\nwhat has happened in this section of\nsnowmobile trail is that there is a\nrailroad that goes above the snowmobile\ntrail and so there's lots of taconite\nthat has fallen off of the rail cars and\nwe had to bike through it\nit's the extra taconite\nso\nI just took my first tumble\ngot my knee pretty good\ntires are pretty gunked up just had to\nput the chain back on\nI'm gonna try keep going keep the\nmindset positive\nmy show S I have never been so happy\nit hold me back yep got it\ngo go go\nGadget\nokay we'll meet you at the next one stop\nplaying I'll see you again oh crap come\non shoes shoes\nokay\nthere's another that's not my water\nbottle okay someone else someone else\ndropped it I put the power to the petals\nas we were on pavement and I finally had\nmy bike shoes and was suddenly in a much\nbetter mood\nI just saw somebody going the other way\naway from the snowmobile trail we're at\nabout 9010\nblood all over his face helmet was off\nhe obviously crashed on snowmobile trail\naccording to the West I'm gonna be super\ncareful uh coming along with me\nnot sure if you can see the red sign out\nbut that's telling us to turn see it\nonto the snowmobile trail so\nthis is the section I rode yesterday\nso I feel\npretty confident that I can do it again\ntoday\nlet's see\nif I go to the left I don't I avoid the\ngate\nwalk over this little\npump\nand I'm in\noh the gate's open today well\nthat's okay\nthis first part is solid and mostly done\nyesterday should be better than the\nuntil I get here\nI've already had one crash today\nI need another one\nagain they don't make these easy to\ncross\ntrying to get some of the mud out while\nI'm\nI think I had to\nrun up this hill yesterday because I\ndidn't have enough momentum oh go ahead\nsorry\noh and there I'm cutting it Groove again\nI'm thinking I'm finding out here\nit's interesting is\nwe're obviously all choosing\nthe same line\nbecause there's\none really dark spot\nin the middle here\non the snowmobiles Trail there is what I\nrefer to as the water crossing but I\nlater find out the water crossing is\nactually further on and what we're going\nthrough is just a mud pit I had been\nprepared for this and had plastic\nbooties that I put on over my shoes and\nwas able to just walk straight through\nthe mud\nriding it is not the good line\nas some of us have found out\nI've watched four people fall\nas you can see there I just made it\nthrough the water crossing my toes just\ngot a little bit wet\nand I don't know if that's because I got\na hole\nin my plastic booty covers or\nif um\nwater came up over the edge\nso oh a lot of people stopped here so\nI can figure out what is going on\nI think\nhow's everybody doing oh we're all good\nyeah thanks for asking as I came out of\nthe snowmobile trail the first time\nthere was a group of people standing\nthere and one of those people was Nancy\nand her garment had stopped working and\nit wasn't recording and it wasn't\nshowing her the route and so she didn't\nknow how to navigate I had paper cue\ncards and so I volunteered to navigate\nwith her and we ended up racing almost\nthe whole race together\nteacher and so when I talk to my\nstudents about determination yeah I'm\nlike\nin my mind\nthere's no way I can't\nand when you have that mindset\nfigure out how to get to the end you\nwill figure it out there's nothing\nthat's impossible\nit is Mind Over Matter\nyou're so beautiful huh\nacross the hill\noh\njust lovely\ntime for cookie break\nHere Comes Nancy\ngot here and ride the good line and wash\nthe Fall colors you doing okay\nawesome\nvery much\nfirst aid station I think so just roll\nthrough here\noh just a beautiful\nclimb here\nall of the Fall colors I don't know the\ncamera does it justice\njust\nso beautiful\nthat's right it's turning itself around\nthat's for sure\nthe smiley face on a crane\nsay that it's correct yeah it's for us\nit's for us they were thinking about us\nthere's my little pavement section into\nthe wind\nlet's just say my eggs didn't fare too\nwell in those bumpy roads\nOne cracked open oops it'll be okay\nstill tastes good\nwe're about 40 miles in I'm feeling\npretty good I've eaten a few things\nwe've got one more water crossing coming\nup but\nyou know it's not too bad it's a little\nwindy right now but\nI can't complain too much\nthis has pretty much been my view all\nday\nuh pretty amazing gravel roads\nand beautiful fall colors just the Reds\nand oranges and yellows\nit's just gorgeous\nlittle did I know that that view was\nquickly going to change\na little climb here\nand we'll turn right\nwe're almost back to the\nCreek Crossing\nyippee yay\nI like to think of the route as two\nLoops there's a bottom Loop and a top\nLoop Nancy and I were going along quite\nquickly on the bottom Loop when the\n7-Eleven group ended up catching up to\nus that was the group that was stopped\nright after the snowmobile trail with\nNancy and you'll hear a little bit more\nabout them throughout the race\nwe're covered yet from the first River\nCrossing\ntotally are you ready to Bunny Hop at\nthis time oh tables happen okay I got\nthe GoPro running this time\nupdate on the situation I think we\nmissed our turn\nyou're heading back to it\nI think I see it\nI think we're almost there\noh that was far too easy to miss\ncoming up here on our left now\nnow we're back on the snowmobile trail\nI am ready\nI am not going for style points people\nit's all so trampled down\nbut these keep my feet mostly dry\nI'm ready for that Bunny Hop where is it\nyou missed it I missed it\nthank you\nso I'm out here still in the snowmobile\ntrail\nI said I'd do right now is to make it as\nmuch time as I can\nbecause I know that a lot of these\npeople\nvery much right now\nsections and I've been actually doing\npretty well on these normal positions\nconsidered\n38 millimeter tires\nfennel\nand just\npop it in all right cool across things\nI've been doing\npretty well\nsmack\nhead past me\nI'm very\nthankful for\nnot make\ntraining\nlook at who it is\ntrained me to go over things\nit's the update\nyeah my tire fits right in there\nperfectly after going through the\nsnowmobile trail the second time we hit\nsome really rough double track before we\nfinally found the river crossing we're\non some double track that's for sure\ngo ahead\noh I'm trying to decide what I do\ngo away\nwhat I'm gonna try and keep my feet dry\nthey're dry as of now so\nfeet got a little more wet but\nI made it across\nnow we got some\nyucky yucky mud\nhere\nnow I understand Creek Crossing\nbut this is not mile 50 this is mile 53.\nmade it through\nback to this\nwith Logan frilled yeah we didn't die of\ndysentery yeah\nyeah yeah I mean\njust a little while to go\nI kind of wish I had somebody in front\nof me\nit's a little difficult to\nto navigate not knowing where I'm going\nwe're not\nto roll up to aid station\nat the Ice Station I have a banana\nI've picked up a few snacks\nI'm Gonna Fill my water and eat some\nlunch burrito time\nso we've got some like almost to finish\nMaple stuff\nsome bananas Gatorade\naid station is well stocked over here\nthey're making peanut butter and hummus\nsandwiches pickles all the good things\nlots of bikes out here\nsun is out\nfeels good on my skin\noh beautiful view\njust gorgeous\none kind of Roadblock\nthere ended up being a truck blocking\nthe road so we had to stop for just a\nfew seconds before it finally backed\ninto the driveway and we were able to\ncontinue on\nthis road is is really bad that water\nbottle\njumped out and hit myself in the back of\nthe head\nso I stopped and picked it up because\nI'm not losing a water bottle here today\nbig bumps or potholes\nswitch after\nsome of the uh\nroads and not roads we've been on today\nI can't necessarily say that the obvious\nchoice is the right one\noh sandy sandy sandy oh whoa whoa\nthat's hike a bike\nyep\nthese seem a little bit like they were\nplanted in rows and the wind was blowing\nthrough them\nI'm gonna try it\noh yeah there you go\nthere we go\nlook at this\npulling up to another aid station\nnumber two\njust left the second aid station and I\nam freezing right now but\ndownhill with the towing we got this 25\nmiles to go I mean finishing this is\ngoing to be a great accomplishment\non the last section of the course there\nwas some really rough double track that\nwas almost like single track it was very\nRocky and very rough and mostly downhill\nforeign\nand I just saw a couple of sets of tire\ntracks in the mud so\nit gives me hope that we're still on the\nright track\nit's a little bit wet back in here\nif you look really closely\nright down there you can see tiger\ntracks so\nnext turn is on\ndouble track with no signs so let me\nkeep my eyes out there are not many of\nthese heck of the north signs out here\nbut when I see them I am so very happy\nto know that I am on the right path\nthat was so rough\nyou can go for the easy way of saying it\nokay we gotta climb here\nand it looks just as rough as what I\njust dropping down\nsession\nor maybe not\nanother sign right there so thankful\nI'm sitting there going huh which way do\nI go which way do I go so now I got\nabout three miles and\nfirst you have to Traverse the mud\nand right it's gonna be the way to go\nlooks the way that most people have\ngone\nI made it through\ngood to know\ngoing right\nI don't know that I would have known\nthere this way to go\nso it's just\njust slow going\nand then we get on to\nsmooth stuff like this and it's like\nokay I can do this for a while\nI couldn't do this for a while\nand get back on the rocks and you're\nlike oh\nthis line over here is better\nand then as soon as I get over here oh\nmy God the other side\nwhich is better\nit's kind of the grass greener on the\nother side kind of debate here\nthat was a whirlwind I didn't even think\nit's doing the GoPro on but pretty much\nwhat happened was there's a porta potty\nand our friends from the 7-Eleven team\nare all standing on the side and I'm\nlike I don't need to use the bathroom\nwe've got like 10 miles left\nand so my well it's Gonna Keep pedaling\nI see my mom\nshe's taking pictures and she's like\nstop stop we need to get your picture\nthere's a professional photographer sit\nup there doing portraits and my mom is\ngiving out cookies and chatting with all\nthe guys so\nthat was what just happened\nand like I just said 10 miles to go so\nclimbing a hill\nand then power to the pedals we're about\nto make our final\nturn of the day before returning to the\nfinish line of course\nNancy and I had raced almost the whole\nrace together and as we were getting\ninto the final stretch we were kind of\npushing the pace a little bit so I sat\nbehind Nancy for a little while and then\nshe started to slow down this is when I\nmade my move and I raced past her to\ncatch up to the 7-Eleven group\nas I was saying I used all 22 gears and\nstill had lots of things\nyou go ahead\nI don't know how long I'm gonna be able\nto pull for but\nton\nso pretty much just just lost them\nshould be\nhang up on the finish here really soon\nall right\npush shut up legs shut up\nyou don't hurt\nyou don't\nhurts\ntongue to finish strong\nyou've almost done a hard thing but\ndon't give up till you get there\nhard things don't happen on their own\nshot up legs\nare you in one piece yeah good I dropped\nNancy yeah\nwe beat those four guys\nthanks\neveryone's not cooking she works hard\ncookie you're back\ngood job Nancy I know I'm like I just\nrode my bike for 106 miles and all of a\nsudden I feel like I don't know how to\nride\nthere's a water feature down there oh\nyeah it was here this morning\nand that's nothing compared to

          "transcript": "seven\nsix\nfive\nfour\nthree\ntwo\none\nsee you at the finish line yay hello\ngive me hint my name is kevin\nand today we're up north of minnesota\ngoing for another ride i'm riding the\nheck of the north with about 600 other\npeople i'm going to be doing the 100\nmile course\nstarted at 8 am to give myself\nplenty of time to finish\nplenty of time to enjoy the day\nplenty of time to enjoy the beautiful\nscenery too\nthis is right\nat the end of september\nwhere everything is changing colors up\nhere in northern minnesota\nso it's just going to be\nan absolutely stunning day\n[Music]\nsome people are so fast\nwow\nthis is the best\nthank you lord for this day\ngoal is\nto go hard today i just kind of want to\ntest\nhow well i could do 100 miles and then\nhow i feel at the end of it because i\nknow i can do 100.\nfind myself in a bit of a group\nwith doug andy\nand one other person who i haven't\ngotten to introduce myself to yet\nbut they're ripping my legs off\nwhich is kind of good that's what i\nwanted to see how long\ni can\nhold\na faster pace than i would normally do\nbut now\nwe've hit\natv trails\nso\nnowhere near smooth\nor as enjoyable or\nas easy to talk to a camera\nlet me put this down quick before i\ncrash\nbut i'm glad i'm in a group\nmountain bike would have been nice for\nthis\nthere's a lot of this\ni'm gonna regret\nbringing the gravel bike\nwith tubes\nthis is beautiful\noh i can't see the rocks now\n80 miles in\nstill frozen still super cold\nbut\nthere's very good news\nin two forms one\nwe're on pavement well\nfor at least a little bit\neven though it's windy\nand then number two\nsun came out baby\nhopefully we start warming up real soon\nbecause i need it\nalright so you knew one of my goals was\nto find somebody to ride with\nand just\naccidentally ross and i have been like\nplaying hopscotch not hopscotch it's not\nthe right word we've been just like\ngoing passing each other one passes the\nother bad leap frog and there you go\nleapfrog at each other for the last 20\nor so miles\nso i'm like all right let's just start\ntalking ross is an animal he hopped on a\nbike for basically the first time eight\nmonths ago\nand now he's doing a hundred miles\nup north here he's been riding all\nthrough the winter he did 130 somewhere\nely but\nwhy do you like riding a bike ross\ni can turn my brain off and i can just\nride\ni got three kids full-time job and\ni've never experienced anything like it\ni can just totally disconnect be out in\nnature and i love it\nthere you go go ride your bike\n75 miles left still feeling good and now\nmaybe ross and i will just stick it out\nto the end\nthat'll be fun\ni've joined one of the two fast groups\nthat passed me\nlet's see how long it takes them to\nto drop me\nbut if i could just stay with them to\noffend it this will be awesome\nross is with me too i think\nride it all out\nrim brakes huh\nthat's awesome\nabout\nfive miles\nwith them\nand i can't anymore\ni am\ntoast\nand we still got 70 miles\nscenery is nice though\ndamn\nthey're so fast\ncall back up with them\nby the way i'm just talking to the\ncamera back here\nchronicling how long i can keep up with\nyou guys\ni was dying\nand ross passed by in the group\ntold me to join so here we go for new\nlife\nokay\ni lost the group with ross\nand\njust a bunch of fails today\ni didn't stretch before going out i just\ndidn't have time\ni also this was partly intentional i\nwanted to just see how hard i could go\nfor how long\ni'm\nprobably 40 miles in\nand i'm toast\ni'm toast\nmy average speed right now is\nit doesn't say yeah\ni don't know i don't have it well\nyeah i'm done\ni'm done\noh my legs are loaded\nso i have a thera gun\nin my checkpoint bag i'm out 58\nthat's 19 miles away\nget there\nrub out hopefully that\nhelps me survive the last you know 40\nsomething miles\nall right\ni'm gonna keep dying over here but\nhey enjoy some of the scenery\nwell i'm not riding right now\nand that is because i took a stop look\nat this beautiful sun\nthat sun means things are starting to\nwarm up and i still got all my like\nserious winter layers on so\ni'm gonna shed those i was hoping to\nmake it to the checkpoint at mile 58\nbefore i stopped but\nit's all right\nthe point is to enjoy this ride too so\ni've enjoyed pushing i did 40 miles in\nlike two hours two and a half hours\nhello\nwhich i've never done before so that's a\nfun little new record\nbut my body definitely feels it like i'm\ntoast right now i'm still gonna make the\nrat at least i feel good enough to\neasily still make the hundred miles but\nnot at the pace i was going so\nwe're gonna shed some layers\nand then keep riding\nsomething else i've learned is\nif you're gonna stop\njust stop\nget everything done that you think you\nmight need in a stop\ndone\nit might take you\nit might take an extra three minutes\nif you think about the time\nit takes you to stop again in half an\nhour\ndo that one other little thing go stop\nagain one\nit's like\njust do it all so right now\non that stop i went to the bathroom\ni stretched\ni tightened the front\naxle on my bike because that was loose\ni switched all the layers right so all i\nhave was just a little shirt this\nwindbreaker and then\nmy babes\ntook all the stuff off\nthe buff\nand then\nfilled up the water i had an extra water\nbottle on the bottom\nput that to the main one\ndid everything\nso now i feel rejuvenated completely\nshould be able to easily make it to the\ncheckpoint\nand then keep riding from there but\njust a little tip you're going to stop\nstop and get everything done at once so\ni just i'm riding\ni see someone pushing their bike\ni don't know if it was a racer i didn't\nwant to assume so i just asked like hey\nit's all okay he goes yeah that was\ngreat are you in a race\ni was like yeah i'm in a race he goes\nwell just in case you didn't know\nthere's a lot of people ahead of you i'm\nlike ah\nah thanks brad\ni really appreciate that thank you\ni get it i'm slow fine\nsavage\nso this was my plan\ni knew joe was starting at 8 45.\njoe was much faster than i am\nso the goal was\nstart\nhead out as fast as i could\nuntil you caught up to me\nwhich he did a\nmile probably like\n55 or something\nnow we'll hopefully ride together to the\nfinish\nalthough he's not feeling too well so\ni'm gonna put this down i gotta go catch\nup so\nlook at this we made it\ni've been riding with milo for a little\nwhile\nthey're awesome\nlook at all this\nall right who's got the party where's\nthe\nthere it is there's the party\ngoal now is replenish the goo replenish\nthe like electrolyte mix and stretch a\nlittle bit and i use the therigon i\nremember i put the theragun in my bag\nfor this reason\nhopefully stretch everything out and be\nrenewed and leave here soon\nto finish the last couple miles 58 miles\nin i can't say i feel good but i'm gonna\nall right where's my bag\nthere it is\noh\njoe thank you\nhow you feeling\nnot good\ndo you need anything i have some heat i\nhave a couple other\nburritos with me uh\nno mine is pretty rough though but the\nlittle bit i have left is i needed to\nall right all right look at this\nbeautiful spread\nthank you so much\ncan i steal stuff okay or not steal oh\nhere we go\njust take it we'll grab one and one\nwe'll crush those now\nand then i want a banana for sure\nsour patch cool\nthank you i appreciate it\nmy back all right so status check\non my body my back hurts\nand my legs feel very heavy\nthen on the bike\neverything is very muddy\nvery muddy all across the board\nbottom bottles toast\neverything\nhere too\nwe're gonna eat this we're gonna shed\nsome layers and put them in the bag that\nthey'll take back\nthera got my legs out fill water and\nthen\nthis is great this is beautiful i mean\nlook at this surrounded by awesome\npeople doing stuff like this too blessed\nman too blessed\nall right checkpoint done\ngot everything done i wanted to i feel\nfantastic milo got their bike fixed\nit was just\nsomething easy for someone who knew what\nthey were doing\nneither of us could have probably\nfigured it out but\nnow check who we just get to enjoy for\nthe next couple hours\noh yeah\noh yeah oh wait am i going the wrong way\nwell maybe\nthere was an entrance there but it says\nit joins back up from here\nso i'm hoping that's right\nyo\nmira\nand with a headwind too\nalso fun fact\nmilo and i found out milo and i found\nout that we're going the wrong way\nfrom that checkpoint there's a little\ni'm assuming like 30 something mile loop\nand we we're going the wrong way on that\nloop but we're too far in to want to\nturn around and do the right way\nhowever what's making me regret that\ndecision is the fact that\nwe've been into a headwind\nthis whole time\nwhich would be a tailwind\nfor everyone who we see passing us\njust like this person\nright here\nenjoy the tailwind\nokay not amused\nokay well\nit was uphill\nheadwind\nand now\nnow we have an atv trail\nmama no let's just let's get this thing\nalmost there i think i don't know where\ni'm at on mileage i'm not trying to look\nbut i am still going the wrong way hence\ngps freaking out\nguess what i've been rewarded with\npavement and a tailwind\nyes\nbasically the whole way back to the\nso i think i have about 20 miles left\nto finish this race hello\n8.9 miles left you probably can't see\nit's too bumpy\non this stinking road but\nwe're in the single digits\nto finish\nheck of the north\nplus mile race\ni am so excited\nalmost there baby almost there\nall right that loop that we did\nbackwards or that i did backwards along\nwith milo\nwas horrible turns out i'm not the only\none who made that decision\nlandon did as well yeah\ni'm an idiot no not an idiot because\nthen that makes me want to anyways\nlandon has been like my saving grace for\nthe last\n15 plus miles or something because he's\njust\nsuper bright super energetic loving life\nand a good good energy instead of i'm at\nthe point where i hate everything so\nhe's just been there we've been having\nsome great conversations great person\nlandon thank you for saving me hello now\nwe have eight miles left to the finish\nand we're just gonna coast them together\nand then die\nafter all the crap we've been through\ntoday they couldn't just leave good\nenough alone\ncheck it\nseven miles left\nthat's like at least a foot deep so\nthere's no way we're riding through that\nyou ready to get wet again landon\nman let's just go i'm not even gonna try\nto\nit's just gonna be what it is\nthere we go yep\nthank you\nkev does river crossings\noh and then oh perfect oh yeah this is\nexactly
