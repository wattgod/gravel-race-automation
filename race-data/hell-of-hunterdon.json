Three options (29/55/81 miles) let you pick your suffering level."

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Only 16% unpaved despite the gravel reputation—this is fundamentally a road ride with dirt sectors.

      },
      "climate": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Early April New Jersey means variable conditions and high wind probability. The 2019 edition had 'the best weather they have had in 11 editions' according to organizers, while 2015 featured gusting wind that had 'riders leaning hard and being pushed across the road.' Organizers embrace bad weather as Belgian classics ethos."
      },
      "altitude": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Sea level New Jersey with the Sourland Mountains maxing out around 500 feet—you'll get more altitude driving to the parking lot than during the ride. Zero physiological impact from elevation, which makes the suffering purely mechanical from distance, climbing, and weather. Your lungs work fine; your legs just hurt from terrain and fitness demands."
      },
      "adventure": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "GPS-only navigation adds some consequence since the course isn't marked, but you're riding maintained public roads in suburban New Jersey, not wilderness. The unpaved sectors provide variety without true remoteness—you're never far from civilization. Hurricane damage forcing course changes shows real-world adventure, but this stays fundamentally a day ride through rolling countryside rather than exploration."
      },
      "prestige": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "It's 'The Mid-Atlantic's Premier Spring Classic' but that's like being the tallest building in Trenton. Sells out in 24 hours among regional cyclists who treat it as their season opener, but zero national recognition. The Belgian theming is and the founder actually raced in Europe, which gives it more credibility than most American 'classics.' Still, it's a New Jersey ride that most serious racers have never heard of."
      },
      "race_quality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Not actually a race—roads open to traffic, no prizes for finishing order, just timed cutoffs. Course design is solid with Belgian classics inspiration, but it's fundamentally a supported ride. Two bridges still out from Hurricane Ida means you're not getting the full original course."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Authentic spring classics atmosphere with Belgian flags at aid stations and proper suffering ethos. Post-ride party at Princeton Elks Lodge beats most events' offerings. Matthew Vandivort noted the vibe was 'without a doubt friendlier than most USAC races' with 'no built-in hierarchy based on USAC category.'"
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Welcoming environment that grew from 35 to 800 riders while maintaining accessible culture. Matthew Vandivort observed riders 'carrying a big smile on their faces' including 'rider in jeans that passed us mid-ride on a beautiful vintage steel bike with downtube shifters and toe clips.' Many participants have never done categorized racing."
      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Capped at 400 riders in a region with millions of cyclists, so you get decent local talent but zero national depth. Most participants are weekend warriors treating this as their spring opener, not serious racers prepping for nationals. The equipment spread from vintage steel to modern carbon suggests wide ability range rather than sharp competitive field."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Strong value proposition with well-stocked aid stations, technical support, GPS files, and post-ride party. The event grew from 35 riders to 800, consistently selling out, indicating satisfied customers. Bruno De Geest, who came from Belgium, called it 'a pleasure as well as an honor to participate.'"
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Princeton area lodging will hit your wallet, but the event itself is within 45 minutes of Newark airport for reasonable travel logistics. You can run this on a standard road bike with 28mm tires—no need for specialized gravel equipment most riders don't own. Single-day format means no multi-day accommodation costs, and New Jersey location keeps it accessible for the entire Mid-Atlantic corridor."
