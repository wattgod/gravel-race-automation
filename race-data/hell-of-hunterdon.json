        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Kermesse Sport runs a tight ship. Well-stocked aid stations, SAG support, technical assistance from local shops, GPS files provided. The Belgian aesthetics aren't marketing fluff - founder Brian Ignatin raced in Belgium and the authenticity shows."

        "score": 4,

Hollow Road punches you in the mouth in mile one. Montgomery Road's unpaved descent reminds you this isn't your Sunday group ride. Aunt Molly Road's hidden potholes and ruts separate the attentive from the mechanical'd. Hopewell-Amwell's 13% gradient 8 miles from home is where dreams go to die. The rest is rolling NJ farmland at its finest."
