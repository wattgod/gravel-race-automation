      "character": "81 miles through New Jersey's Sourland Mountains with 13 gravel sectors covering 16% of the course. Belgian classics vibes without the transatlantic flight. Hollow Road punches you in the mouth in mile one. Montgomery Road's unpaved descent reminds you this isn't your Sunday group ride. Aunt Molly Road's hidden potholes and ruts separate the attentive from the mechanical'd. Hopewell-Amwell's 13% gradient 8 miles from home is where dreams go to die. The rest is rolling NJ farmland at its finest."

      "origin_story": "Brian Ignatin raced in Belgium and Germany, then came home and missed the suffering. In 2009, he convinced 35 masochists to ride 82 miles of New Jersey in early April. 'I wanted to create a ride that captured the spirit of the Belgian Classics, which everyone could enjoy.' By 2019, 875 riders showed up. The Belgian flags at aid stations aren't marketing – they're doctrine."

      "summary": "This is the Mid-Atlantic's answer to Flanders, and it actually delivers. Not trying to be a 'gravel grinder' – it's a road ride with gravel sectors that rewards early-season fitness and bike handling. The Belgian aesthetics are genuine, the post-ride party is proper, and for anyone in the NYC/Philly corridor, it's the non-negotiable season opener.",
      "verdict": "Regional Classic",
      "strengths": [
        "Authentic Belgian classics experience without the plane ticket",
        "Well-organized by Kermesse Sport with real support",
        "Accessible for road cyclists – don't need gravel-specific gear",
        "Welcoming vibe for riders of all levels",
        "Post-ride party with real food and local beer"
      ],
      "weaknesses": [
        "Sells out in 24 hours – set an alarm for registration",
        "Only 16% unpaved – not a 'gravel grinder' if that's what you want",
        "Early April NJ weather is a dice roll",
        "Course changed post-Hurricane Ida – bridges still out",
        "Not nationally recognized outside Mid-Atlantic"

      "bottom_line": "If you're within 3 hours of Princeton and own a road bike, this is your spring classic. Bring 28mm tires, not 50mm. Embrace the wind."

    "black_pill": {
      "truth": "It's NOT a gravel grinder. Only 16% unpaved. This is a road ride with gravel sectors thrown in to test your bike handling and keep things interesting. Don't show up on your 50mm tire gravel rig expecting 100 miles of dirt – you'll be on pavement 84% of the time feeling silly.",
      "consequences": [
        "Over-biking it makes you slower on 68 miles of pavement",
        "Wind is the actual boss – forum reports cite gusting wind as primary difficulty, not gravel",
        "Registration chaos – no lottery, just first-come-first-served selling out in 24 hours",
        "Hurricane Ida changed the course permanently – pre-2021 race reports describe a different ride"
      ],
      "expectation_reset": "Train your road fitness. Learn to paceline and shelter from wind. Show up on your road bike with the tires you'd use for a spring training ride. The Belgian classics ethos means they WANT bad weather – that's the point."
