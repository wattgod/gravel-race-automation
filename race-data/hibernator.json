The pacing suggests a well-structured distance that builds through sustained effort rather than quick bursts. Similar distance to Crusher in the Tushar."

Less climbing than The Mid South."

Three distance options (31, 61, 103 miles) through Nicolet National Forest sounds decent on paper, but the execution feels more like organized suffering than polished racing. At least they've been doing it since 2013, so they've worked out some kinks."

The event offers 'spacious FREE field camping' and focuses on local farm-to-table food rather than expensive expo infrastructure. Entry fees go to rescue squad, not promoter profits. More affordable than Crusher in the Tushar."
