        "explanation": "3,500 feet over 62 miles in Wisconsin is about what you'd expect—rolling but not mountainous. It'll wear you down through accumulation, not big climbs. Enough to separate the fit from the fucked, but nothing that requires altitude training."

        "score": 2,

      "altitude": {

      "prestige": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Twelve years in and still nobody's heard of it outside northern Wisconsin. No pro field, no coverage, no notable winners on record. It's a charity ride for the Laona Rescue Squad in a town of 400 people, not a marquee event."
      },
      "race_quality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Route support cuts off at 5 PM sharp, so if you're slow, you're screwed. Three distance options (31, 61, 103 miles) through Nicolet National Forest sounds decent on paper, but the execution feels more like organized suffering than polished racing. At least they've been doing it since 2013, so they've worked out some kinks."

      "experience": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "You're riding 'hidden gravel' in a national forest, which beats suburban bike paths, but there's nothing particularly memorable here. Early October in northern Wisconsin means you're gambling with weather, and when support bails at 5 PM, the experience can turn grim fast. It's functional, not transcendent."

      "community": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Dan was served 'pumpkin chocolate cookie' with 'hot apple cider spiked with Vermont Maple Syrup' at Honest to Goodness Farm. The event offers 'wood-fired maple syrup' at feed zones and emphasizes '100% about community and supporting local businesses.'"
      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Population 400 in Laona tells you everything about the talent pool. No data on field size because there probably isn't much of one. This is where weekend warriors go to feel fast, not where serious racers test themselves."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Dan praised the 'honest to Vermont hospitality and beauty' with homemade cookies and cider at aid stations. The grassroots event includes 'spacious FREE field camping' and 'farm-to-table post-ride meal' with all proceeds supporting local rescue squad equipment."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Laona's 400 residents mean minimal lodging costs since options don't exist. The event offers 'spacious FREE field camping' and focuses on local farm-to-table food rather than expensive expo infrastructure. Entry fees go to rescue squad, not promoter profits."
