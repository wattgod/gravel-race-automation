        "explanation": "Goshen sits 15 minutes from Fayetteville with XNA airport access and on-site parking at the Goshen Community Center. The race caps at 600 riders to manage infrastructure. Deanna Duke noted the challenge of heat logistics: 'I started running out of water in spite of having a pack and bottles... I got to the support and plunged my hand into the barrel of EMPTY WATER BOTTLES.' Support vehicle shortages can occur mid-race."

      "length": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "67 miles creates what one rider calls 'an absolute smashfest' where race-winning moves happen early. Crystal Anthony launched her winning attack with just 13 miles remaining in 2025, while the men's podium separated around mile 15 in 2024. Elite winners finish around 3:25-3:30, making this a high-intensity sprint rather than endurance suffering."

        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "The 85% gravel course features chunky, loose Arkansas surfaces through tree-covered Ozark terrain. Deanna Duke reported 'literally bodies waiting for aid cars' at the bottom of the first sketchy descent around mile 12. Elite rider Maude Farrell admitted she 'couldn't quite keep up with her on the descents' when chasing winner Jenna Rinehart, showing technical skills separate the field."

        "explanation": "Over a dozen climbs through 4,850 feet of Ozark rollers, including a 2.9-mile climb reaching 2,200 feet at mile 33. Crystal Anthony's race-winning move came at 'a 12% gravel ascent of about a half a mile' with 13 miles to go. The constant rolling terrain creates what one rider described as relentless climbing where 'nearly everyone was walking' on the steepest pitches."

      "climate": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Late April Arkansas weather proved devastating in 2023 when temperatures hit 95°F with high humidity. Deanna Duke warned: 'Did I mention it was hot?... predicted temperatures of 95 and high humidity.' The heat caused massive attrition with '37 people got carted off the race that morning. About 20% of the field.' Weather can determine finishing rates more than fitness."
      },
      "altitude": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "The highest point reaches 2,200 feet on a ridgeline 33 miles into the course. Standard Ozark Mountain elevations pose zero altitude considerations for any rider accustomed to normal elevations. The climbing difficulty comes from grade and heat, not thin air."

        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "The only US qualifier for UCI Gravel World Championships, racing through remote Ozark backcountry under 'a lush awning of natural woodlands.' The technical descents create real danger - one rider crashed into fences due to limited visibility through trees. This isn't just adventure riding; it's your shot at Worlds if you can survive Arkansas chunk and heat."
      },
      "prestige": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Unique status as the sole US qualifier for UCI Gravel World Championships draws serious talent. Despite this exclusivity, only 407 riders showed up in 2025 compared to Belgium's sold-out 2500-rider qualifier. The UCI backing provides international legitimacy, but American participation remains surprisingly low for such a valuable qualification opportunity."
      },
      "race_quality": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "UCI-standard organization handles the technical Ozark terrain professionally. When Jenna Rinehart dropped her chain in the first sectors, she recovered to win, showing the race allows for comebacks. The course marking and timing meet international standards, though support vehicles can run short on supplies during extreme heat conditions."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "A pure smashfest through beautiful but punishing Ozark terrain where elite times cluster around 3:25-3:59 for 67 miles. The short distance creates constant intensity rather than endurance pacing. One rider captured the aftermath: 'At the bottom of the first sketchy descent, there were literally bodies waiting for aid cars. I was told there was worse to come.'"
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Strong NW Arkansas cycling culture supports the event, though participation lags behind European qualifiers. The 2025 field included elite riders like Crystal Anthony and Jenna Rinehart competing alongside recreational riders. Community support extends to dangerous descents where crashed riders help each other, creating shared suffering bonds despite the competitive format."

        "explanation": "NW Arkansas offers affordable lodging in Fayetteville near the University of Arkansas. XNA airport provides reasonable flight access to the region. Local terrain allows for quality training rides before the race. The biggest expense risk comes from equipment - Arkansas gravel demands reinforced tires and multiple bottles for heat management during extreme weather years."
