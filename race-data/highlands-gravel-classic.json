          "transcript": "Highlands Gravel Classic race recap. The\nHighlands Gravel Classic is a part of\nthe UCI Gravel World Series and is one\nof two races in the US that are a part\nof the series. The UCI Gravel World\nSeries of Events serve as qualifiers for\nthe UCI Gravel World Championships that\nwill take place in Zout Limberg this\nOctober. The qualifying criteria for\nthese events is to finish in the top 25%\nof the category you're racing in to\nqualify for that category at the UCI\nGravel World Championships. Obviously,\nfor the elite races, you can get a wild\ncard domination from your national\nfederation, but finishing in the top 25%\nautomatically qualifies you and takes\nstress out of relying on a wild card\nspot and also serves as getting you some\nspark points so you are not starting at\nthe back of the grid. Going into this\nrace, I was pretty confident with where\nmy fitness was at and I typically ride\nwell on the terrain that this course is\non. So, I had my eyes set on racing for\na podium finish and the potential to\nrace for the win as well. We had a\npretty small field, so only the top four\nfinishers on the day were going to\nautomatically qualify for the World\nChampionships. And there were only a\nhandful of really fast guys I noticed on\nthe start list, including Skyler Taylor,\nJohn Pervvis, Ted King, and several\nothers. I was pretty confident with\nwhere I was at fitness-wise, bike-wise,\nsetup wise going into this race, so my\nsights were set pretty high. But\nunfortunately that would not work out as\nthe race began to unfold. This course 68\nmi long rolling terrain in northwest\nArkansas, but the roads are pretty\ntreacherous gravel and they have been\nknown to cause flat tires both at this\nrace and lots of other races in the\nsurrounding area. For this, I ended up\nrunning mountain bike tires yet again,\nwhich seemed to be the move for a fast\nracing gravel tire. 2.2 to Connie Race\nKings on the state carbon all-road 100%\nthe fastest option out there. I am very\nvery happy with that setup and I would\nrun it again and will run it again. Race\nstarts we have a small field so it\ndoesn't really matter start position. I\ndid start at the front this time but\nthat really doesn't matter since the\nfirst real effort of the race isn't\nuntil about 20 25 minutes in. This first\nclimb comes after a relatively fast\ndescent section, which the last time I\nran this race caused a lot of people to\nflat out of contention, but this year\nbeing a smaller field size for the elite\nmen, did not really cause any issues.\nGoing up this climb, there were several\nhard efforts made at the beginning of\nthe climb. I was able to follow through\nwith relatively ease. Didn't feel too\nbad um on the legs until we got to the\ntop and it kicked up yet again. On this\nsecond pitch, there was a little gap\nthat opened up. And I believe I yell at\nthe rider, \"What are you\ndoing?\" as I try and like panic close\nthis gap as I see something start to\nform before we hit the top of the climb.\nAnd as basically, as soon as I make a\nlittle effort around him to latch onto\nthe lead group, my back just left the\nbody entirely. Um, if you've never\nexperienced back pain while you're\nriding before, it is pretty immobilizing\nand that definitely makes it hard to\npedal hard as well. I start going\nbackwards and see these lead trio that\nbecomes four or five riders just kind of\nride away and I fall back through the\nnext group on the road, which would be\nthe bulk of the racers on the day. I end\nup falling off the back of this group\nnear the top of the climb, but do end up\nchasing on with one other rider and fall\ninto this chase group that would end up\nracing for fifth. At this point, I was\npretty demoralized. I knew racing for a\npodium spot was pretty much out of the\nquestion, but I was still confident that\nthere were only three or four up the\nroad and we might be able to catch one\nof them by the finish and race for the\nlast spot that would automatically\nqualify for the World Championships.\nUnfortunately, my back did not really\nget any better and I was able to roll\nthrough for most of the day up until the\nlast climb when back started acting up\nagain and was unable to hold on to the\nremainder of this group going up the\nfinal climb. Did end up riding the last\n20 30 minutes in solo, finishing ninth\non the day. Obviously top 10 not a\nterrible result, but in a field this\nsmall and when I had my eyes set on\nracing for a podium and potentially the\nwin, this is a pretty big flop in my\nbook. I will say bike setup worked\nperfectly. Big tires were 100% the move.\nI did have mechanical, but 100% my own\ndoing as I forgot to tighten my water\nbottle cage bolts for the bottle cage on\nthe seat tube and lost both the bottle\nand the cage about halfway through the\nrace. Thankfully, it wasn't hot. Then, I\ndid plan to start with three bottles.\nOne was in my back pocket, so I did\nstill have two full bottles for the race\nand actually had some left extra at the\nend. Diabetes-wise, we were set.\nNutrition-wise, we were set. Bikewise,\nwe were set. Tactics-wise, we were set.\nBackwise, not set at all. Um, so\nunfortunately, that ended up being the\nend of my race pretty early on. and then\nkind of ended up just rolling through in\na like might as well get it done sort of\nmanner. Little demoralizing, but it\nhappens. It's racing. I didn't crash.\nThankfully, John Pervvis, who did crash,\nwe don't catch it on camera, but you can\nhear it\nhere. Thankfully, he was all right.\nEnded up having to DNF because of event\nshifter, but was pretty all right from\nthe grand scheme of things.\nUnfortunately, my first Gravel World\nSeries race of the year did not go to\nplan, but that just means we got to add\na few more on the calendar to come up.\nThanks for watching. See you at the next\none.",
