        "explanation": "Late March timing in coastal North Carolina provides variable spring conditions, with course including wet areas and mud holes that depend on pre-race rainfall.

The 180-rider total field suggests decent participation without elite competition depth. Less competitive depth than Almanzo 100."

        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Registration runs $60-100. Rocky Point, North Carolina location in rural coastal area should provide reasonable lodging and dining costs compared to resort markets.

Similar expense level to Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."
