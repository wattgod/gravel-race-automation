          "transcript": "[Music]\nwhat's up everybody welcome back to\nanother video it's been a while uh we\nare in Franklin\nGeorgia at homegrown gravel uh this is\nthe first time I've ever uh done this\nrace it's the first race of my 2025\nseason and uh we're picking things up\nhere in the last hour or so of this\nrace um 100 miles mixed surface we are\nalready right now starting to catch some\nuh 60 MERS in the chase group this is\nlike Chase group one behind three\nlers um there are six riders in this\nChase group not including the 60 mile\nguys we have uh right to my left right\nhere Ian Boswell we've got Ty Magner up\nthere on on the front uh Andy Scarano\nand a couple of other guys whose names I\ndon't remember but uh but yeah we've got\nthis little Chase group going and uh I'm\ngoing to take you through these final\nfew uh miles here these final moments of\nthis race just to kind of show you how\nuh my day went and played out and uh\nright now we are yeah like I said\nbattling for uh fourth\nplace uh in this race\nso I'm going to fast forward a little\nbit and take you to the first of several\nmoves that sort of like dictated uh the\noutcome of this\nrace okay so uh as you can see from that\n20x sped up uh clip there uh weather is\npretty decent we got some blue skies we\ngot Ian Boswell going into a super tuck\non this little descent\nhere um at the start of the race what I\ndon't have on video just because of my\nbattery life on my GoPro it was pretty\ncold um the race broke up super early it\nwas at Mile like 15 or 20 that the uh\nthe Breakaway formed and it was\nsomething like 27° fhe when we started\nand so a lot of guys still wearing you\nknow like uh leg warmers or fulllength\nuh uh tights got a lot of different\nlayers on\nmyself and um and yeah if you were\npaying close attention to that sped up\nuh section of this video you could see\nthat uh there is a ton of gravel on this\nrace I think like uh mostly it was\ngravel so maybe this this section of\nthis clip is a little misleading but\nyou'll notice that this pedmont Rider is\ngoing off the front a little bit here\nwe've got Tai kind of doing his thing\nand then Andy Scarano just stays seated\nand goes away I'm kind of waiting for\neveryone else to sort of pull\nthrough and uh as soon as these guys\nnotice that they've got a little bit of\na gap uh they are Savvy uh Road riders\nwith tons of\nexperience uh you'll see Tai there're\nkind of uh snaps onto Andy's\nwheel and uh I'm standing up but I'm\ndefinitely not going full until I notice\nthe threat and so I'm going to uh get\nback up to these\nguys so we're at the point in this race\nwhere everyone is sort of starting to\njust do these little testing\nmoves uh trying to see what type of legs\neveryone else has got uh this late in\nthe race so uh move\nneutralized uh test you know past I\ndon't know um I think Boswell right now\nis on my wheel and I was kind of hoping\nthat he was going to come around me um I\ndon't know if he knows who I am or\num you know what to expect from a rider\nlike me this may be sort of under his\nradar but uh but yeah back into the\nrotation on this little paved section so\nlet's see what the next little move is\nokay so I picked things up here uh just\nto give you guys a little bit uh more\naccurate I guess like picture of what\nmost of this course looks like so as I\nmentioned it was mostly gravel roads\nlike this but for whatever reason that\nsection of course uh where I turned my\ncamera on maybe uh that was actually\npart of the reason why I was also\nthinking about turning the camera on at\nthat time is just because uh on these\ngravel descents you know some of the\nstuff is pretty\nchunky uh kind of gnarly stuff I\nwouldn't have had a hand to take off the\nbars to turn that thing on but um yeah I\nthink this is a great example of what to\nexpect from this course if you've never\ndone this this is like um parts of\nAlabama and Georgia tons of roads just\nlike this one you know this race took\nplace in like late February this year\nand so uh just super super early spring\nand uh I would imagine that the weather\ncould be a huge Factor you know\ndepending on the amount of rain uh or\njust the temperatures\nthemselves coming into this race I was\nsort of like following the uh the social\nmedia from the race director and the uh\nthe race itself and they were sharing\npictures and videos of like a super\nmuddy section so that sort of convinced\nme to switch from my plan of of riding\nmy road pedals and shoes to uh switching\nto like an SPD mountain bike cat so here\nwe've got Boswell attacking on this\nlittle uphill this is the first of\nseveral late attacks that he's going to\nuh start to throw at us here and so I\nthink everyone in the group basically\nresponds but if you're looking down\nthere in the corner you know it's like\n6:30 uh standing up on some rough gravel\nto just stay with uh Boswell\nand uh I think actually maybe that move\nis going to whittle this group of six\noriginally down to like\nfive uh so we've got Tai still here we\ngot this peont Rider Boswell on the\nfront myself and Andy Scarano behind me\nand uh yeah tons of rolling uh little\ngravel Hills like this on this course I\nthink there was actually quite a bit of\nclimbing uh so I'm going to let this\nlittle Gap open up and he comes through\nand like I said I think that this is the\nuh the end of our group Boswell\naccidentally takes a wrong turn there\nand that kind of\ndeflates uh whatever momentum we had\ngoing but um that's not going to be the\nlast time we see him attack so uh if I\nremember correctly I think we're going\nto make another left here right back\nonto the\ngravel um seems to sort of follow the\nlogic of the uh the course creators uh\nwas to sort of like keep us on gravel as\nmuch as\npossible but yeah like I said sort of\ndeflated if you're looking down at the\nnumbers here we're not doing much power\nand this is sort of like another ripe\nopportunity for another\nattack and so uh I don't think it's much\nlonger before we get our next little\nmove but right now Boswell is just going\nto go back to the front and do his thing\nso let's see what happens next\nso my uh guess earlier was uh correct\nour group of six has been whittel down\nto five um\njust kind of rotating through we've got\nthese sort of technical descents where I\nI kind of liked being on the front on\nthese because you could see your line\nmore clearly uh that was sort of a rare\noccurrence on this course I'd say we\ndidn't run into a ton of uh like motor\nvehicle traffic but there were several\ncases where there were like dogs out\nthere yeah look at how chunky some of\nthese sections of gravel can get\nbasically no shoulder you can see where\nthe water has been running down there\nand just like cutting a gully so you\ndon't don't want to get off of like the\ncrown of these roads but this peont\nRider is sending it we got some Riders\nup here on the right and we're about to\nhave like the next critical moment Ur So\nno one else behind me is coming through\nso I'm having to do a little bit of uh\nPower just to get back onto this dude's\nwheel and uh like I said these uh\ndownhills can be a little technical so I\nwas kind of trying to stay on my own\nline over here on the\nleft but uh once I get up to the\nRider I kind of stay on the gas I don't\nknow if we have a gap behind us right\nnow but this guy is also uh going pretty\nhard here so I stay on his\nwheel and I think as we Crest this\nclimb I'm starting to come around him\nand if I would have known that there was\na little bit of a gap behind me I think\nI would have you know actually attacked\nthere like in\nEarnest but uh we got more of these 60\nMERS and here goes Boswell coming past\nme uh full gas and there's really no one\nelse so uh there goes Andy and I am sort\nof still right now hesitating and\nwaiting for the next Rider to come\nthrough and that doesn't really happen\nas soon as I notice that that isn't\nhappening I try to get on the gas as\nmuch as possible but standing up on this\ngravel is actually kind of tough because\nuh you start to lose traction when you\nstand and those two are uh not looking\nback so right now I'm basically trying\nto fully commit to reattaching myself to\nthese two Riders up in front and uh yeah\nthere's no one on my wheel anymore so\nI'm basically out here on my\nown\num bringing this gap down just a little\nbit but not quite making it and yeah for\nme like rewatching this footage one of\nthe things that I noticed was just like\nhow tantalizingly close I do end up\ngetting to these two uh and I'll let you\nwatch watch kind of my suffer Fest beats\nper minute is up at like\n175 uh we're still on a bit of an uphill\nnot necessarily like total panic\nstations yet but we're getting there so\nI'm going to let you guys watch this\nwithout the audio just to see if you\nfeel the way that I feel about how close\nI get to these two\noh\nso right here is the Moment of Truth\nBoswell sitting on scarano's Wheel he\ntakes a look back sees how close I am\nand uh doubles down stands up and makes\nanother uh Sprint acceleration which\nbasically like snaps the elastic in my\nChase so I didn't know it at this moment\nin the race but this is basically uh our\nrace being\ndecided I think uh Scarano ands up\ngetting Boswell eventually in the Sprint\nfor fourth Boswell gets Fifth and I\nended up in sixth place on the day just\nin the money so uh so yeah I spend the\nrest of this race again I'm not that far\noff but uh wasn't enough at the end to\nreattach would have been super fun to\ncome into this uh uh final with a group\nof riders that would have been really\nexciting to be in a Sprint finish but uh\noverall I wasn't too dis satisfied uh\nwith how my day went I will uh give you\nguys a little uh info on like what the\neffort was like here and uh give you a\nbetter sense maybe of what it was uh\nlike to race this race uh down in\nGeorgia in\nFebruary so here we have it 5 hours and\n6 minutes normalized power\n279 uh 99.6 miles with 321\nTSS so uh pretty good effort and like I\nsaid not too dissatisfied with the way\nthat that went\ntaking you to one final little clip here\nwhich is this uh sort of double track\nmuddy section right before the uh the\nvery end of this race uh this would have\nbeen a little bit dicey like I said\nearlier maybe kind of fun to come in\nwith a group of other Riders there were\nlike some big holes and water and uh\nsand to contest with\num but yeah this was also the second of\nthe course that the organizers were\nmaking sure that we had all seen prior\nto the beginning of the race because we\ncome out it's like at Mile 2 or 3 that\nwe hit this originally and then of\ncourse at the very end here we're coming\nback the opposite direction right before\nthe finale but uh yeah beautiful day\nbeautiful course uh check out homegrown\ngravel in\n2026 if you are interested in getting in\nsome early season racing in February\ndown in the state of Georgia and\nAlabama and uh thank you all for tuning\nin for another video uh please like And\nsubscribe I will be posting more videos\nlike this one in the future as this\nseason rolls on and uh we'll see you on\nthe next\none got you got it yeah nice H

The 100-mile course is mostly gravel roads with some paved sections, featuring chunky and gnarly descents typical of Alabama and Georgia terrain. The race starts cold with temperatures around 27 degrees Fahrenheit, requiring proper layering. A key challenge occurs early when the race breaks up around mile 15-20 with breakaway formation, and there's a bottleneck section that can separate riders from the main group. Riders describe it as having minimal climbing, making it appealing for those who prefer flatter gravel courses. The event offers multiple distance options including 62-mile and 100-mile routes, with the longer distance crossing state borders for added adventure."
