Elite times averaging 19 mph suggest serious climbing slows even strong riders. Three distance options (61, 28, 13 miles) accommodate different fitness levels in the Appalachian terrain."

The organizers specifically highlight this as where 'tougher courses suit you' for omnium points accumulation."

        "explanation": "Race dates have shifted from April 2024 to March 2025 to May 2026, suggesting weather timing challenges. One rider noted 'I ran out of battery' during the 3+ hour effort, indicating conditions or duration that stress equipment preparation. Spring timing in Appalachian mountains creates serious weather variability."

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Part of Southeast Gravel Series but marketed with generic superlatives like 'one of the most exciting venues in the Southeast!' Dylan Johnson's consecutive wins provide some credibility, but the regional scope and lack of notable prize purse or national recognition limit broader cycling community awareness."

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Organized by Southeast Gravel out of Greenville, SC, but basic details like aid stations, cutoff times, and surface breakdown are mysteriously absent. They offer GPS files and a Friday pre-ride of River Road, which suggests some effort. But when a race can't tell you what you're actually riding on, that's a red flag about organization depth."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "The full weekend format delivers more than just racing - Friday night Q&A with guest pros at Big Pillow Brewery, Saturday night camping with food and hangouts. 'Don't just ride your bike and leave town. Stick around Saturday for more camping, food, and hang out.' Post-race hot springs soaking adds unique recovery element."
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "'Hot Springs has a tiny and vibrant downtown' with restaurants and breweries where participants mix with Appalachian Trail thru-hikers.

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Field sizes of 337 in 2024 and 174 in 2025 show regional draw without deep competitive depth. Dylan Johnson's repeat wins and 4-6 minute gaps to second place suggest limited elite competition. Time spreads indicate strong recreational participation but modest racing quality in the overall field."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "$85 early entry gets you 61 mountainous miles, a custom water bottle, pre-race party, and post-race camping with food. That's reasonable for what appears to be a well-supported weekend experience. The $40 youth pricing shows they actually want to build the sport, not just extract maximum dollars from adults."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Hot Springs Resort offers tent camping, RV sites, and cabins for family-friendly weekend stays. Saturday night camping eliminates hotel costs after the race. The small town setting keeps food and lodging reasonable, though no major airport nearby means driving for most participants."
