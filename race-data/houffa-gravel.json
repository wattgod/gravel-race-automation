      },
      "climate": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Late August in the Belgian Ardennes means you avoid the spring mud season and summer heat waves that can destroy European races. Weather's typically cooperative without being boring, and you're not dealing with altitude or extreme temperature swings. The research lacks specific weather horror stories, which in Belgium usually means conditions stay rideable rather than epic."
      },
      "altitude": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "This is the Belgian Ardennes, not the Alps. You're talking rolling hills and river valleys where the biggest physiological challenge is lactate buildup, not oxygen debt. Sea level fitness translates directly with zero acclimatization concerns. If altitude is part of your race selection criteria, you're looking at the wrong continent."
      },
      "adventure": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "You're racing through established cycling tourism territory in a well-developed European region, not discovering hidden gravel gems. The Ardennes have cycling history, but this feels more like a workout with UCI credentials than a true adventure into unknown terrain. Three laps of the same 47km circuit means you've seen everything by the end of lap one."
      },
      "prestige": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Mads Würtz Schmidt's win and quote \"Back to the winning ways on the trails. I love The Ardennes in Belgium\" shows elite rider appreciation. The 2026 European Championships hosting rights and UCI World Series status provide credibility, but this remains a five-year-old regional qualifier rather than destination racing."
      },
      "race_quality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Schmidt's race-winning move came from a technical section gap: \"Coming out of the section I looked back and saw a gap of 50-70 meters. Decided to put my head down and go for it.\" The course creates opportunities for decisive moves, though the redesign to reduce technical difficulty suggests organizers prioritized accessibility over challenge."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Three 47km laps with 700m elevation each gives you a proper suffer-fest structure, and starting from Houffalize's main square has that European town charm. The immediate Rue du Saint Roch climb separates pretenders from contenders right away. You get your qualifier status if you're in the top 25%, which feels achievable without being handed to you."
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Belgian cycling culture runs deep, and Houffalize has MTB World Cup heritage that carries over to the gravel scene. Being part of the Bolero Gravel Series creates a season-long community of riders chasing qualifiers together. The Friday packet pickup and small-town logistics force riders to actually interact rather than disappear into massive expo anonymity."
      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "It's a regional qualifier that happens to have UCI backing, not a destination race that pulls international talent. The top 25% qualification rate suggests they're not drowning in elite depth - compare that to races where making the top 10% is an achievement. No mention of notable winners or standout performances means you're racing weekend warriors with good engines, not future world champions."

        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Top 25% qualification for UCI Gravel World Championships, plus 2026 European Championships course preview, multiple distance options, and access to elite fields including Van Aert appearances. The Belgian setting provides authentic cycling culture with \"legendary climbs\" and traditional Ardennes racing atmosphere."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Belgium in August means peak tourist season pricing in a region that caters to cycling tourism year-round. No specific airport mentioned, but you're looking at Brussels or maybe Luxembourg connections, then ground transport to the Ardennes. Houffalize isn't overflowing with budget accommodations, and being a mountain bike capital means everything's priced for cycling tourists with money."
