The 2026 European Championships hosting rights bump it up slightly, but this isn't Unbound or even close. It's a stepping stone race for riders who want to say they qualified for something bigger."
      },
      "race_quality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "The course hits you with Rue du Saint Roch from Liège-Bastogne-Liège within 5km, which sounds impressive until you realize they had to redesign it for 2026 because the technical sections weren't working. 70-80% off-road sounds decent on paper, but the lack of any notable past winners or memorable race moments tells you everything about the competitive depth. It's functional gravel, not legendary gravel."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Three 47km laps with 700m elevation each gives you a proper suffer-fest structure, and starting from Houffalize's main square has that European town charm. The immediate Rue du Saint Roch climb separates pretenders from contenders right away. You get your qualifier status if you're in the top 25%, which feels achievable without being handed to you."
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Belgian cycling culture runs deep, and Houffalize has legitimate MTB World Cup heritage that carries over to the gravel scene. Being part of the Bolero Gravel Series creates a season-long community of riders chasing qualifiers together. The Friday packet pickup and small-town logistics force riders to actually interact rather than disappear into massive expo anonymity."
      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "It's a regional qualifier that happens to have UCI backing, not a destination race that pulls international talent. The top 25% qualification rate suggests they're not drowning in elite depth - compare that to races where making the top 10% is an achievement. No mention of notable winners or standout performances means you're racing weekend warriors with good engines, not future world champions."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "You get UCI World Championships qualification opportunities, a preview of the 2026 European Championships course, and three distance options from 50km to 141km for whatever your ego can handle. Entry fees aren't disclosed, which in Belgium usually means reasonable compared to the $200+ American gravel circus. Multiple laps means spectators and support can actually see you suffer repeatedly."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Belgium in August means peak tourist season pricing in a region that caters to cycling tourism year-round. No specific airport mentioned, but you're looking at Brussels or maybe Luxembourg connections, then ground transport to the Ardennes. Houffalize isn't exactly overflowing with budget accommodations, and being a mountain bike capital means everything's priced for cycling tourists with money."
      },
      "length": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "141km for the full distance hits that sweet spot where you can't win on pure sprint power but don't need ultra-endurance pacing strategies. The 94km and 68km options let you pick your poison based on realistic self-assessment. Three laps of 47km each means you get to learn the course and adjust tactics, unlike single-loop sufferfests where one wrong turn ends everything."
      },
      "technicality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "They literally redesigned the course for 2026 to include 'less technical downhills,' which tells you the current version isn't exactly pushing technical limits. 70-80% off-road sounds promising until you realize Belgian gravel tends toward fire roads and doubletrack, not the chunky limestone or desert singletrack that separates bike handlers from the pack. It's gravel for roadies, not MTB converts."
      },
      "elevation": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "700m per lap adds up to 2,100m total for the full distance, which will definitely hurt but won't destroy anyone who's trained properly. The Rue du Saint Roch climb from Liège-Bastogne-Liège heritage gives you one legitimate suffering moment early. Rolling Ardennes terrain means constant pressure rather than explosive climbs - it's cumulative damage that reveals fitness, not pure watts-per-kilo brutality."
      },
      "climate": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Late August in the Belgian Ardennes means you avoid the spring mud season and summer heat waves that can destroy European races. Weather's typically cooperative without being boring, and you're not dealing with altitude or extreme temperature swings. The research lacks specific weather horror stories, which in Belgium usually means conditions stay rideable rather than epic."
      },
      "altitude": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "This is the Belgian Ardennes, not the Alps. You're talking rolling hills and river valleys where the biggest physiological challenge is lactate buildup, not oxygen debt. Sea level fitness translates directly with zero acclimatization concerns. If altitude is part of your race selection criteria, you're looking at the wrong continent."
      },
      "logistics": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Starting from Houffalize's main square keeps things simple and central, with Friday packet pickup available for early arrivals. Multiple distance options and age group categories starting every few minutes shows competent organization. The advice to 'arrive early for parking' suggests typical small European town constraints, but nothing that proper planning can't handle."
      },
      "adventure": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "You're racing through established cycling tourism territory in a well-developed European region, not discovering hidden gravel gems. The Ardennes have legitimate cycling history, but this feels more like a workout with UCI credentials than a true adventure into unknown terrain. Three laps of the same 47km circuit means you've seen everything by the end of lap one."
