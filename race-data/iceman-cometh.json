Rick DeShields finished in 2:39 while 9-year-old Ryder Pankey completed it in 2:49, calling it \"really just steady, consistent pace.\" The distance creates intense racing but you're done before lunch. More compact than Grinduro."

One rider describes Sow's Ear as \"riding moguls, but it was completely rideable, just something to get through.\" Rick DeShields pulled \"a two-wheel slide before hitting 2 rollers that I managed to pull a gap jump on.\" The sandy stretches before Dockery Road \"will eat your front wheel if you're not paying attention.\" More technical than most — comparable to Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

Less climbing than The Mid South."

Race director Steve Brown notes the unpredictability: \"There could be snow, or it could be 62 degrees and sunny.\" One rider shed layers in \"panicked last minute change\" as temperatures rose quickly during the race. More weather exposure than Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Northern lower Michigan sits essentially at sea level. Altitude isn't a factor - riders struggle with cold air and effort, not thin oxygen. The course terrain focuses on technical sandy sections and rolling hills rather than elevation-based difficulty. Lower altitude than Gravel Worlds — no thin-air concerns."
      },
      "adventure": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Point-to-point racing through Pere Marquette State Forest creates contained wilderness adventure.

Riders face real consequences for mechanical failures, but you're never far from civilization across the 30-mile route."

The race draws riders from 37 states outside Michigan and reaches capacity in under one day, but remains primarily Midwest-focused rather than global cycling calendar priority."

As you ride closer the noise is DEFINING!\" The community atmosphere felt \"unmatched\" to riders, with cheering throughout the 30-mile course. Michael Green celebrated his age group win \"with a Bells beer in hand\" at the finish line festival."

The race includes everything from 9-year-old Ryder Pankey to age group specialists, creating massive participation but primarily regional competitive depth rather than global elite fields. Less competitive depth than Almanzo 100. As John Arias puts it: \"I was totally stoked to have Pro Gold lubricants on my drivetrain. Pro Gold kept my Scott 29er running smooth and fast for the entire race\""

Registration opens in March and reaches capacity quickly, suggesting strong demand for the complete package."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Registration runs $80-120. Grand Traverse Resort hosting packet pickup suggests premium lodging costs, with November timing in peak fall tourism season affecting prices. One dedicated rider trained with \"old water bottles filled with drywall plaster to add weight\" showing the lengths people go to prepare. Point-to-point logistics create shuttle expenses, but November timing avoids peak summer Michigan tourism rates. Similar expense level to Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

It occurs the first weekend of November each year and is an absolute riot! This is front/rear footage starting in wave 3. My Wahoo froze at 23.5 miles in, so no on screen ride data after that point. Start temp was 32 degrees with no precipitation. Ended up 1:54:41 and earned an age group podium spot - 4th in age group. Great day to race. I was on my Trek Supercaliber with Light Bicycle/i9 Hydra hubs and Sram X0/XX Transmission drivetrain. Front camera is GoPro Hero11 and rear is GoPro Hero11 Mini.
