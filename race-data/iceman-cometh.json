Rick DeShields finished in 2:39 while 9-year-old Ryder Pankey completed it in 2:49, calling it \"really just steady, consistent pace.\" The distance creates intense racing but you're done before lunch."

        "score": 1,

      "adventure": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Point-to-point racing through Pere Marquette State Forest creates contained wilderness adventure.

As you ride closer the noise is DEFINING!\" The community atmosphere felt \"unmatched\" to riders, with cheering throughout the 30-mile course. Michael Green celebrated his age group win \"with a Bells beer in hand\" at the finish line festival."

Registration opens in March and reaches capacity quickly, suggesting strong demand for the complete package."

      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Grand Traverse Resort hosting packet pickup suggests premium lodging costs, with November timing in peak fall tourism season affecting prices. One dedicated rider trained with \"old water bottles filled with drywall plaster to add weight\" showing the lengths people go to prepare. Point-to-point logistics create shuttle expenses, but November timing avoids peak summer Michigan tourism rates."
