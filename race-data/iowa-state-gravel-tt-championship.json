        "explanation": "Elite riders like Nathan Kullbom finished in 58:44, with most category winners clocking 58-66 minutes total. Short even for a time trial format, though Rick Hopson describes the longer training version as 'brutal' with plenty of suffering packed in."

        "explanation": "The Abandoned Bridge features '25 yards of mud on the approach, 75 yards of mud on the other side, and a 12-inch concrete ledge on both ends.' The R.A.U.S. section includes 'sand dunes and water crossings that might require a bike hoist' according to course descriptions."

      "elevation": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Course description mentions 'a gentle rise followed by a distinct climb' with three hills that are 'all big ring-able, but all attention-getting.' The False Flat finish section adds some vertical interest but nothing approaching serious climbing terrain."

      "climate": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Race day 2015 saw 'clear, 87 degrees, wind 12 mph' conditions. Rick Hopson notes that road shoes only work 'if it has rained in the past week,' indicating weather significantly affects course conditions and equipment choices."

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Amana, Iowa is famous for German heritage tourism, not gravel racing adventure. Forty miles of flat farm roads in a time trial format eliminates exploration, suffering, and discovery. This is suburban training ride distance with a timer attached, not an adventure worth traveling for."
      },
      "prestige": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "It's a state championship with 'TT' in the name, which sounds official until you realize Iowa isn't the epicenter of gravel racing. No pro riders show up, no media coverage exists, and the gravel community doesn't discuss it online. The $20 entry fee tells you everything about how seriously the cycling world takes this event."
      },
      "race_quality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Course features three distinct challenges including the abandoned iron bridge and R.A.U.S. sand section. The final 1.3 miles vary from 'smooth and hard packed dirt' to 'deeply rutted and completely unridable goo' depending on recent rainfall."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Rick Hopson describes the IC-Amana-IC loop as a 70-mile gravel time trial featuring the Abandoned Bridge with its 25 yards of approach mud, the R.A.U.S. sand dunes and water crossings, and a False Flat B finish that ranges from smooth hardpack to unridable goo. The beer stop at Millstream Brewery mid-route and post-race camaraderie define this as a local cycling club tradition more than a polished event."
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Awards ceremony happens at Millstream Brewery immediately after racing. The event sometimes coincides with the Festival of Iowa Beers, capped at 1,200 people, creating a proper post-race celebration atmosphere with local brewery integration."
      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Elite category winner Nathan Kullbom suggests some competitive depth exists. However, the race primarily serves to share a local training route with a broader audience rather than attract serious regional or national-level gravel talent."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Twenty-dollar entry includes state championship medals, trophies, and post-race ceremony at Millstream Brewery. When the race coincides with Festival of Iowa Beers, riders get access to Iowa brewery tastings as part of the broader event experience."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "The $20 entry is nearly free money, but Amana, Iowa isn't a destination with cheap flights or abundant lodging. You'll drive there, which keeps costs reasonable if you're regional. No information on parking fees or hidden costs, but at this scale, they're probably just happy you showed up."
