      "summary": "Iowa Wind and Rock is 340 miles of truth serum on gravel. You can't hide behind teammates, tactics, or short bursts of power. This is 30-50 hours of continuous forward motion where the wind grinds you down, the constant rolling terrain never lets you recover, and your own brain becomes the biggest obstacle. The terrain itself isn't hard—Iowa gravel is fast when dry, and there are no mountains. But the wind is relentless. You'll spend hours grinding into headwinds at 8-10 mph, watching your finish time balloon, questioning why you signed up. Sleep deprivation hits around Hour 25-30. Navigation errors happen. The loneliness of self-supported racing amplifies every doubt. And April weather is a lottery: rain turns the course into mud hell, cold overnight temps test your layering strategy, or you luck out with mild sunny conditions. If you finish, you'll have earned something rare: proof that you can keep going when every external factor and internal voice says stop. If you DNF, you'll learn exactly where your limits are. Either outcome teaches you something.",

If you want to discover what you're capable of when forced to grind through 340 miles of wind, darkness, and fatigue alone, this is your test. Budget 30-50 hours. Bring redundant everything.

      "character": "Iowa Wind and Rock is 340 miles of honest Iowa gravel: crushed limestone roads rolling through endless agricultural land with zero shelter from wind. The terrain itself is moderate—8,000 feet of elevation spread thin via constant short climbs—but the format is brutal. You'll ride 30-50 hours continuously, crossing into overnight hours (often two nights for slower riders), navigating independently with GPS, and resupplying at small-town gas stations. The wind is THE defining feature: 10-20 mph sustained headwinds and crosswinds for hours. The constant rolling terrain means you never truly rest—always climbing or grinding into wind. River valley crossings add scenic variety and punchy elevation. The self-supported format strips away all external motivation. No crowds. No aid stations. No teammates. Just you, Iowa backroads, and the mental test of keeping pedals turning for 40+ hours when quitting would be easy.",
