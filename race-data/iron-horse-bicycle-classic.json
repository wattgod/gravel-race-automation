The gravel course ascends Horse Gulch Road and loops around Texas Creek with technical terrain challenges."

Ned Overend's 67-year-old time of 2:15:18 compared to the 2:07:31 winning time shows how altitude affects even mountain bike legends. Time cutoffs at Coal Bank (12:40 PM) and Molas Pass (1:20 PM) account for altitude-induced slower pacing."

Hosting the 2026 Colorado Gravel State Championships elevates gravel credibility beyond the historic road race foundation."

Multiple disciplines running simultaneously add spectacle beyond just your event."
