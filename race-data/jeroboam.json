        "explanation": "Legendary status in the ultra-gravel community as arguably 'the world's toughest gravel ride.' Backed by 3T's Gerard Vroomen and embodying the brand's gravel philosophy. However, no UCI or major series affiliation limits global recognition outside dedicated ultra circles."

        "explanation": "Professional organization by REVERB Cycling and 3T. GPS tracking on 300km, structured aid stations with gate closures, quality event village with camping, and well-planned checkpoints. The 'not a race' philosophy is executed authentically."

        "score": 5,
        "explanation": "Life-changing for those who finish. The combination of night riding, sunrise over Italian alps, wine culture integration, suffering alongside international riders, and the sheer accomplishment of completing 300km with 7,000m climbing creates memories that last a lifetime. 'An experience I'll never forget' is a common refrain."

        "score": 3,

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "The entry is cheap; everything else is not. International flights to Italy, 3-4 nights in wine country accommodation ($100-600/night), meals, and bike logistics easily push total trip costs to $1,500-2,500+ for North American riders."

        "score": 4,
