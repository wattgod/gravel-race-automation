east of Milan and\nit's at the base of the Alps so what you\ndo is your ID up into the Alps unlike\nyour usual Alpine claim in holiday this\none was a gravel challenge there's lots\nof sections of some pretty gnarly gravel\nand one thing we didn't realize until a\ncouple weeks before the race was it was\nactually that night Pina for a couple\nhours now we've just remembered that\nwe're not actually in the UK so\nnothing's opened our every day we're\ngoing to get a little bit pastry in a\nminute the sustenance we need to make\nthe correct decisions during the right\ngear for the rig so the Jeroboam is a 3t\ncycling component event and rather\ncoincidentally they have a gravel bike\nbluntly the bike seat equals Amit I took\nout my moose trout RS our long-term bike\nI've ridden it big distances on the road\nand on gravel so to take it on something\nthat's a bit more bike packing flavored\nwas quite exciting and I was just really\nkeen to see how we could actually get on\nalthough there was the opportunity or\nthe choice to light through the night we\ndecided we weren't quite epic enough for\nthat and we decided to stop at 100\nkilometer mark and booked an air B&amp;B in\nthe end yeah but there was a tactical\nreason for that neither of us had ridden\nin the outset that altitude before so we\nfigured with the timings that we'd hit\nthe big mountain pass maybe I know\nmidnight one o'clock in the morning and\nobviously pitch black and we wanted to\nactually see the views at that altitude\njust because we've never been that high\nyou can't Instagram at night yeah there\nyou go\nso what's the point\nwe got a stamp because we had a little\nroad but to get a stamp of a checkpoint\nbut about 30 seconds into the ride\nwe got absolutely so actually decided\nand we've got the rain jackets on\nimmediately some people actually pushed\non I was quite amazed about it\nabsolutely terrific internship for\nhailstones isn't it\nhi I'm Sally we decided to take shelter\nyeah a natural station because there\nwhat's the point down the road it's\nabout hey other riders all huddled\ntogether in the little doorway so we\nthought it towards company\ncan you talk rock today where this let\nit clear it up the saying this might be\nrich in the rib after precious way to\nstop reading good of course take a\njacket off but we're not gonna cuz work\nhardcore like hot yogurt isn't it\nwave them sort of a bit of gravel oh I\nlove a place that wasn't me and yeah\nchill gravel my bikes they make it\nabsolutely horrific noise is not real\nyou're acting okay we got to look at\ntheir prank act I had to look at their\ndrea that's tightened jumpy probably bar\nbracket issue the bit dare funk-rock\ndon'tdon't get their party looking\npretty good though I'm a I'm vibing\noffice almost really pleased it at bra\nBonnie right down to the pad but it\nplanes either looking superb climb\ntoward the cloud best of all I'm gonna\nget to check out Ruben beautiful their\nsick booty Katrine two corners and\nthat is a treat that you get half so\nthroughout the afternoon fairly\nuneventful the only slightly annoying\nthing is that has been ninety percent on\nroad yeah we're expecting a lot more\ngravel and in the end it turned out to\nbe more of a low drag noticing\nthat now lies unreal absolute Kodak\nmoment\nnow they're just cresting over\nStradivari day so I think it's really\npretty amazing view\nanother little toback moment we came to\nthe top of an absolutely ridiculous\ndescent\nI just insane really really steep\nmassive cobbles bigger than your head\nyou add 40 no tires porteños not small\nbut it prize tonight in Harold f5 I\nguess it was night so I I mean I didn't\nhave much big I'd 42 bit 650b say it\ndefinitely pumped out a bit more than\nyours did and you're just more hardcore\nand more hardcore as well\nwe got to the top the first checkpoint\nand light was beginning to fade then had\na little coffee little bit cake fell\nprimo Gert primo good after that we had\na good descent a real good descending\nreally fun night to said that was\nactually 11 o'clock at night at 10 past\n11:00 in ya face good good except we do\nnot get through David I'll characters\nyou've got an object\nI'm also way more Danny MacAskill\nnuclear Scottish absolutely legendary\nbehavior I think a good after come with\nReuben but with one bag we have on there\none bad sexy thing\nno but nice man change your face right\nnow Oh\nAli's joined your ladies watching you\nfat man she's also getting to see their\ntheir AB stunning guns after please yep\nfind that the songs are sick just to\nNathan\nthank you technically\nbeing a huge one about four hours five\nhours five hours\ndidn't quite leave on time either but a\nlittle bit of extra didn't every bad\nthing hello got 50-odd k to the start of\nthe big climb nationally he went ed Eric\nwhat little bit of a niggling knee\ninjury that picked up in the dirty river\nabout a month ago it's one of those\nthings that he just got to stretch it\nthat I thought forgot this morning I\nfound out that it's just a big old knot\nin my thigh so when Jack was going for\nnature poof I am sorry I just got a big\nrock and pressed it down on the knot and\nactually did pretty well didn't it no\nmore shooting pains and it actually\nallowed me to ride relatively pain-free\nbut I pretty hardcore Bunch we are\nthough I mean as I do my business in the\nwoods your abash in your leg with a rock\nI mean it would have looked pretty epic\ncould anyone walked on like a record\nyeah yeah Rivers Jack's gonna have some\nbog rope yeah for emergency food hissing\nmachine already on numero Quatro for the\nday absolute sometime you doing a dogleg\nwhich is basically the start of the\ncrocodile mini crime think it's kind of\never done in my life\nbiggest time I've ever done in my life\nthey didn't start smoothly did it no no\nnot inside so we thought is all good\nstarted climbing then came to a bunch of\nold Italian men but one of them starts\nshouting us like quite belligerent in\nour face and which is quite quite\nintimidating and but after a lot of\nconfusion a lot of I don't know what\nyou're actually saying because they\ndidn't understand me I didn't understand\nthem and one guy basically pointed to\nhis watch pointed to the top of the\nclimb and said 15 so 15 minutes we had\nno idea what was going on there was\nobviously some kind of timing system\ngoing and we just started climbing no\nclue how far we have to go\nthere's always barriers along side of\nthe road marshals marshals look like a\nbig crash pads on the side of the\nwood plywood everywhere she couldn't fly\nunderneath the buyers so we obviously\nassumed something is going either up or\ndown here we didn't know whether it was\nmotorized we didn't know if it was pedal\npowered or just anything away was going\nup or down and we have sort of pretty\nterrified doesn't like an enforced\n15-minute time trial uphill on an ALP\nand where we didn't know where the\nfinish was thankfully absolutely\nthankfully and it wasn't too far and it\nwas a downhill go-kart race a soapbox\ncar race that was hard\nnow I'm quite tired you have to find\nanother day to switchback after\nswitchback Hunter started very steep and\nthen mellowed out\nit's got sleep again just absolutely\ndying for an easier gear both me and Jax\nvery over did the compact front I've got\n11:30 - got a slightly easier 11:30 -\nwhen you've got extended pictures of\nlike 12 12 13 % and all the crap in the\nworld Mathew like no BIOS are just so\nheavy and that's not what you want and\nbut it's what we had so we just plot it\non you don't like the heroes that we are\nalready done for right now and they've\ngot support and biggest being blanching\nfor this which is a mere top in\ncomparison you\ndami out feel a fresh just eat my legs\nPickthall brown bar of the day I'm\nlooking for to find peers out there I've\ngot a feeling this might be the tough\nfor the road pass coming up there's a\nwhole bunch of motorbikes and then I\nthink that's the start the gravel\nsection a good thing you may have\nnoticed from earlier my bike you're not\nmaking such a horrific night that's\nbecause we found t2 motor oil engine oil\nand that's absolutely quiet quiet and\neverything down so the rain in the so\nyesterday absolutely destroyed this is\nthe lube I did have on there that you\ndon't think as much\nyou'll see this in the checkpoint coming\nup get some ground and that's the\ncheckpoint where the people that rode\nthrough the night were probably staying\nso 160 KN and they'd start at 4 p.m. 200\nmiles finishing about midnight not for\nme glad we did it the way we did it\nbecause there are some incredible Israel\nunreal absolutely unreal the top of the\nroad climb wasn't where we actually\nfinished you go beyond the barrier until\ngobble section and then it continues\neven more handsome gravel proper this is\nnice\nso most village is on tarmac and just\nbeautiful beautiful will be out and it\ntopped out at 2,000 135 meters and so\npretty spectacular views from both sides\nthen we just had a bit of a a wild this\nthen after a couple more little bumps\nwhen you drop about 1500 meters in the\nspace of 10 K then 15 km really fun a\nlot of fun we ruled a little bit further\nalong league and we turned up some\nsingle track which was best described as\nsketchy unpleasant so we are super watch\nWarner this is 200 ish Ruben savage one\nover here I don't even understand how it\nworks but flips quite awkwardly a very\nlow speed and that happens but we're not\ngoing to make the 6 p.m. cup of time so\nI think we're going to change the route\nwe're going to go get a coffee because\nyou guys really really want the coffee I\nthink we've probably ridden maybe about\n10 miles of gravel and suggested a more\nsince yesterday afternoon fingers\ncrossed\nyou get wounded up piercing Ruben Zoot\ntook my toe straps I've been using to\nstrap the bags to my bike and finished\nyour saddle back down and please felt\nlike just a really really bouncy saddle\nbecause there's no tension in the table\nbut it worked\nwe still had to get our way out of this\nforest that we were thoroughly lost in\nand look walk would drop into a field\nand then we could see the tracks of all\nthe other cyclists had been rode to the\nend of this field and discovered that\neveryone had made the same mistake as us\njustify the ended and you were feeling\nquite bull caca as I was like what you\ncall me spend Grylls and friend these\nbeggars you get it and just I'd ride in\nthrough the forest\nbushwhack in LA through all looting the\nguards a point where we literally\ncouldn't get any further so I had to\nturn around got a bit lost went back\ninto the field and we had that awkward\nchoice of do we go back the way we just\ncame or I noticed on the other side of\nthe field\nthere was a farmhouse with a suspension\nbridge over the river so we made our way\ntowards the bridge and it was probably\nthe scariest part for all right imagine\nthree wires suspended and then metal\nsheets balanced on top with a few rivets\nvery very thing that was very thin but\nthose rivets actually breaking away from\nthe metal because I don't know been\nthere about 200 years let's go there we\nhad to walk across that you let me go\nfirst I mean if it volunteered to go\nfirst\nbut I think that was as far as the risk\ngoes for the day probably the most\nlikely point that we're going to enjoy\nourselves either through tetanus or\nfalling Cebu to the river below yeah\nbasically like being on an episode of\nThe Fear Factor to get to the bottom of\nthe valley and I wanna have tea lower\nhere and we spotted me what halfway down\nthe sign for golden arches and we knew\nexactly what we wanted we just felt\nastonishingly dehydrated definitely\naware that we were coming DFL DFL have\nwe arrived eventually in a Briscoe you\ncan go go out on and yeah we were beat\nup so\nLuke last people they're all packed up I\nthink they were only still there because\nI had one other bike otherwise everyone\nwould gone home by last my everything in\nfact it's inside out and quite\nmortifying her engine 75k it's about\nwhat we did and still like 6000 meters\nof climbing and it is a ride that has\nadvertised at 5,000\nso someone definitely lied what do we\nlearn from this experience\ngravel bikes are very heavy yep when you\nland all loaded up 90 to 95 percent of\nit was on tarmac including every major\nclimb except the extended bit and top of\nthe big one this is my first time on a\nproperly faster supposed to be properly\nfast gravel bike was on three T\nexplorers I mean even laden dumped the\nbags as hell pretty sprightly dead\nStefan the pines and brakes are the\nwrong way around for me which was quite\nsketchy and also the tires were Salib\nso I was running far too hard not really\nkind of let down the ride a little bit a\nlot of puncture paranoia\npuncture paranoia was like life I think\nI definitely would run a tubeless much\nlower pressures overall I did thing was\na pretty good bike flat sort of terrain\nthere your boots\nwork pretty well yes i sat on my boots\nwith 650 b3t discus c25 pro wheels very\ngood and it's I just really like big big\nchunky tyres and for this is absolutely\nawesome to the tarmac you know\nespecially the big time I climb it's\npretty very slow and brutal yeah and but\nyou just can't knock big tires for road\nbikes off-road basically\nhashtag what do you learn about riding\nwith me you know we've done a fair bit\nof you know riding together here we have\nand now this is our biggest longest\nParis what will you do differently\nriding with me in the future\nit did say a couple mountain biking the\nwoman was actually being towed via by\nbear wrote by the guy so I'll probably\ndo that with Jack next time\nthere and there I guess because we\nwanted to film it we want to take photos\nyou wanted to see the scenery we\ndefinitely did it the wrong way but I\nthink we did it the right wrong way yeah\nit's one of those rides that's\ndefinitely going to stick with us I\nthink probably forever because it is so\nI think just so much happened but maybe\nnext time next year definitely ride\nthrough the night decide with me don't\nride a jack would you do again like yeah\nyeah yeah I do it again\nbut I would do it at my own chopper base\nyeah cuz that's who I am\nthat's not dating today we're gonna go\nhome watch each other's back\noddly the 24 hours left of this no stops\nI don't know if it's being a bigger\nthing or not thanks for I guess tuning\ninto our region\nplan and what people enjoyed are a\nlittle update on our adventure it\ndefinitely has been an adventure out\nthere that's nothing with learning\nthrough don't do pears rate with me\nwait what's hot rumen we're doing one of\nthe week",

I had an absolute BLAST even though I thought I was going to lose my fingers.\n\nRasputitsa Gravel Road Race is a 40mi mud race in Bruke Vermont. There is lots of backcountry gravel roads with 2 very technical sections. Almost 2,000 people were registered for the race so it was full gas form the gun. \n\nClifbar brought my coach Tony from ATP Coaching and my self out to the Rasputitsa Gravel Road Race to see what its all about. It did not disappoint! Gravel racing is so much fun as its a great mix between fools gas racing and having fun on a bike. \n\nReally hope you enjoy the full story of my first ever gravel race at the Rasputitsa Gravel Road Race.

          "transcript": "Hey VC here I want to talk about my\nfirst ever gravel race and how it was\ninsanity so let's just jump right into\nthe story of the rasp a tooth brass\npatoot SIA Rasmus I don't know how to\npronounce it first-ever gravel race\n[Music]\nthe forest\nit is something we can't run\ntaystee\nall right so the plan is to do dirty\nKansa in June but I've never done a\ngravel race so I was really trying to do\nmore than no gravel races before dirty\nKansa so then doing Belgian waffle next\nweekend and I was had the opportunity to\ngo to Vermont to do the Roth spot - it's\nvery cold the name of it means mud\nseason I believe so it's always usually\nvery muddy it says it's only 40 miles\nit sounds like 40 miles it's not very\nthat's not a very long race should be\neasy no big deal so now I flew into\nBoston and then from Boston we drove\ntowards Vermont area like northern I\nmean we're not far from the Canada\nborder Canadian border waiting around\nbaby let's just pretend I want to stay\nlike this forever\nwanna stay right here would you\nthat's the rest we fall until it all\nbreaks down but I need him so I will\nstay\nwhen your almond\nit's a great\nwe get into Berk which is a very very\nsmall town and we're staying in this\nhouse that's like two hundred years old\nvery old house 100% haunted we were kind\nof exploring around and like in our room\nthere's a little baby crib super baby\ncrib with like a rocking chair that's\nlike right next to the crib so for sure\nmama ghost is like protecting the baby\nghost and it's like right at the foot of\nmy bed and then we check out this door\nwhich goes into the basement and look\nwhere I lived I don't have basements I\ndon't never had a basement open this\ndoor - just the scariest place on earth\nand so we go in town there and exploring\nthis basement which has like this rock\nwall that's like blown out demon gremlin\nbabies living in those rocks I could\njust imagine every time I looked in a\ncorner there's just like a black figure\nstanding there ready to kill me\nvery scary okay so then we don't have\nbikes and I brought up my tub my friend\nmy friend and coach Tony Wolfe to do\nthis together cuz I didn't I wasn't\ngonna know anyone I kind of wanted\nsomeone to bounce a story off of a\nlittle bit so he's there with me\nwill that's the guy who brought us out\nthat's our main contact he's from Clif\nBar Clif bars a sponsor of the event\nwill had provided specialized the bouncy\nones diverges like it's those like\nshocks in it that's what we were gonna\nwrite we're gonna ride specialized\ndiverges and we made sure to get there\non Friday with enough time that we could\ndial in the bikes and go for a ride I\nreally wanted to explore the surrounding\narea so then we went to the bike shop\nthat we thought they would be at and\nthey're like no we don't have your bikes\nyou know they had probably have been\nshipped to the ski resort so we go over\nto where registration where the party's\ngonna be where everything is gonna be\nhappening for this gravel right we get\nthere and they're setting up everything\nlike they have this hot making machine\nor you could make your own hats like you\nget these patches you put them on this\nhat and then they press them and then I\ntry to be an innovator and just do all\nthe patches I kind of collage thought I\nwas gonna come out really good it didn't\ncome out as good as\nas what was in my mind and they had like\na farmers market a part of the event I\nmean just inside this like ski lodge\nthere was just so much going on it was\nit was amazing there's a restaurant in\nthere we kind of hung out in there for a\nlittle while waiting for our bikes to\ncome we're waiting we're waiting waiting\nspecialized lady tells us your bikes are\nin New York they're not here along with\na whole other fleeted demo bikes from\nspecialized so then we're like okay\noh no and my coach is like you know\nStretch Armstrong so he has to ride a 61\nso we have like 61 bikes are really big\nbikes they're not common it's gonna be\nvery hard to find one for him so one of\nthe guys that works for Clif Bar he's on\nthe phone with a shop so then he\narranges bikes to come to us but they'll\nbe here at like 11 o'clock at night\nthat's not ideal but at least we have\nbikes right so we have a back-up plan\nbut we have no bikes and I see Canyon\nI see Canyon out there unloading some\nGrails so I go over and I'm talking to\nJeremiah Bishop I believe is his name\nand I was like dude I'm in a pickle I\ndon't have a bike to race tomorrow I see\nyou have a van full of them okay what\ncan we do I was trying to get - there\nwasn't any sizes he didn't have all the\nsizes so I could only get one but I got\none I got a Grail\nI was very big the freakin grill is a\nmassive bike feels like a mountain bike\nwithout suspension so we head back to\nthe haunted 200 year old house I start\nkind of fitting my bike for me for the\ncanyon grill getting my pedals on there\ngetting the GoPro on there getting the\nseat adjusted but I'm not very picky man\nI don't care it felt like a bike I loved\nit felt great\nwe moved the haunted chair in the\nhaunted baby crib out of our room so\nwe're not haunted but do you see what we\nwere moved out of here but you might\nhave disturbed go both ways\ndon't really piss them off but it also\nmight save us okay Mike they might stay\non out there now at least you guys won't\nhave the horror of knowing it's coming\nit'll happen you know like things will\nstart rocking beforehand new boots weird\nno just\n[Applause]\ni me and Tony got to start in the very\nfront and bro there was so many people\nI've never seen so many people it was\ncrazy but we're like you know third row\nme right there on the front pouring rain\nit's freezing cold I am like not very\nconfident in my setup or anything and I\nknow I'm gonna freeze\nbut like bro full set let's go we go\ndown the road it's like a neutral roll\nout go through the town of Burke it's so\ncold\nI mean literally in the first minute I\nwas like I can't feel my fingers already\nboy this is gonna be difficult and I had\nhonestly been anticipating a very\ntechnical race\nit's just slopping through mud lots of\nhiking bike single trail that's what was\nin my mind so we're we hit basically\nwhere the race starts and everyone's\nkind of battling for position to get up\nfront and we're on the road and did\nwe're full gas I mean I have a power\nmeter on but just on perception I would\nsay we're probably doing something 300\nto 450 watts for the first while\neveryone's trying to be up front\neveryone's trying to be up front and\nguys and I'm like dude this is this is\nintense\nnow I downloaded the map to my wahoo so\nI can see the route and I can see the\nprofile so I can I can see where climbs\nare but I don't know the terrain and\nthat's the biggest part of it's the\nterrain you're on so we're going over\nthe road and then finally we turn onto\nthe first dirt road but I mean it's been\npouring rain it's not really muddy to be\nhonest I mean it's soft but it's not\nit's not technical it's not it's not\ndifficult but man the front group of\nlike 20 they started taking off and I\nwhen I look back on this I wish that I\nhad had the wherewithal to go full gas\nand stay with that front group but I had\nno clue what I was in store for I had no\nidea I thought we were gonna be doing\nsome serious technical stuff later on so\nI kind of wanted to save my energy I\ndon't know dude I had no clue but for\nsure now I look back on it there was so\nmuch just you know\nthis road or fire road you know that\nmeant staying with a group like you roll\nso much faster as a group I should have\nbeen with that front group\nI should have bridged to them but I\ndidn't so the front group goes and then\nme and like a couple guys are sort of\nstuck in no-man's land and then I ended\nup bridging to another little no man\nland group but the first day the first\n20-30 minutes were just I mean you were\noh did you\nit was very Fitness II not technical\nlike you you had good fitness you're\ngonna be doing a lot better and also the\nbike choice even if you were on a fat\nbike or a bike with really big tires or\nyour pressure was low you know dude\nyou're it's such a huge disadvantage but\nmy bike set up I had 60 psi and the\ntires I felt great I if it rolled good\nrolled fast so me and like two guys are\nchasing the front group and we hit the\nfirst really technical section super\nmuddy you really got to pay attention to\nyour line if you if you unclip it's so\ndifficult to really get back on and\ngoing when the mud so sloshing it so\nthen I'm thinking dude this is it like\nthis is the rest of the race you know\nit's only 40 miles because 40 miles of\nit's like this then there's a whole\nsection with like hard pack ice snow\nroad so I'm trying not to ride on the\nsnow because it's super snowy and slick\nso then I'm like in the gutter on the\nright it was so much fun though just so\nmuch mud and like crazy chaos and this\nis what I had been expecting is so much\nof this right where it doesn't really\nmatter if you're in a group or not\nbecause it just all comes down to skill\nwe get out of that section and then I\ndon't know man for the rest of the race\nwasn't really anything else like that\nand now they did change the course last\nminute because of some of the roads were\njust so bad and so you know maybe they\ncut out some other technical sections\nbut me and the two other guys were with\nended up getting caught by a huge group\nof guys like 35 guys and I was like oh\nman I thought we were going fast\nand we just got caught by these guys so\nthen we're like in a group of 35 and\nwe're not really gonna catch the front\ngroup I think the front group was a\ncouple minutes up the road but we are in\na group that is racing maybe any other\ngroup behind us maybe they've kind of\ngiven up on racing they're just trying\nto survive but we're racing you know we\nhit climbs there's some like attacks or\nsome efforts but the roads are not are\nnot bad I mean for the weather\nconditions it's not it no big deal\nlike anyone can ride this row bro we're\nclimbing and we're climbing and we're\nclimbing and it is starting to get\nreally cold and then starting to snow\nand then we're getting closer and closer\nto the top as climbing bro it's just\nlike we're forging our way to the north\nto defend the wall gets the white\nwalkers who's coming\ninto his going\ninto his car\noh that's alright I'm fine you're not\nyou're freezing and it's just one of\nthose things over it's like god this\nsocks but you're also like god this is\nsuch a good story and this is epic and I\nI almost wanted to-- snow more just\nbecause i feel like we're going into\nbattle it was very it was very very cool\nbut it has been pretty much raining or\nsnowing the whole time and so my gloves\ni would squeeze my gloves and water\nwould just pour out and now we're gonna\ngo downhill my fingers smoked to the\npoint where I really feel like a lot of\nguys had to think I'm willing to cause\npermanent damage to my hands to stay\nwith this group just keep keep on racing\nbecause out of like something close to\n2,000 people you know we're we're top\ntwenty to thirty top twenty to thirty\nfive something like that it got so\nfreakin cold that my like my brain\nwouldn't work it wasn't working I had to\nwatch my hand shift because I couldn't\nfeel anything so I was like yeah just\nlike my whole arm just trying to shove\nthe shifting there's nuts did but the\nother thing is I'm thinking it's only\nforty miles and like we're cooking like\nwe're not I mean we're going pretty fast\nso I'm in my mind thinking bro like two\nhours three hours maybe I mean I that's\nnot that bad right that's not that hard\njust get through this cold and so then\nwe sort of get to maybe the last like\nten fifteen miles of the race and\nthere's a pretty good little climb and\nthen there were some attacks that\nstarted to come out of that and that's\nwhen our group of like thirty five blew\napart and I just barely made like the\nfront six guys out of this group and I\nwas in my head just thinking this is the\nrace is the race like you've got to go\nyou got to go you got to go so I got on\ntheir wheel and man they were so good at\ndescending I could not feel my hands\nthough so I didn't know how to like\nmodulate pressure on the front brake so\nwe got over this climb\nwere flying down the hill I don't you\nknow I might be full front break and I'm\njust gonna friggin send myself into\nBucks Ville it's just very cautious on\nthe descents I lost their wheel several\ntimes and so then I had to kind of like\npower back on get back onto the wheel\nbut I felt great felt really good on on\nclimbing and and fitness was was totally\nthere because it's like either you're\nclimbing and you're going pretty much as\nhard as you can or you're just surviving\nbecause you're freezing to death so I\ndon't really know what place I'm in at\nthis point\nbut I can see on the profile what's\ncoming up and I see there's a massive\nclimb a super steep climb and then\nthat's pretty much the finish we hit the\nclimb and it pretty much just sort of\nbreaks apart there there's like six guys\nto go pretty much up the road I tried to\njust settle in because it's such a long\nclimb really tried to settle into a pace\nthat I knew I could finish strong with\nthere were signs along this final climb\nthat was like remember you paid for this\nremember bikes are fun you know the\nquicker you finish the quicker there's\nbeer and the finish is just right there\nbut then it takes you on this left\nthrough a very technical section super\nmuddy I plow through that but I'm just\nlike I'm so cold and I'm kind of in\nno-man's land like I'm always always\nthem and so then I kind of get off the\nbike and I'm pushing and I see the\nfinish I'm like oh my goodness I'm so\nready to be done and so then I come\naround like the last turn and this guy\njust all of a sudden from nowhere like\nbumps me up on the inside and and now\nit's like a two-up sprint to the finish\nfor 25th and you nipped me at the line\nby half not even half a wheel like a\nbike throw it's crazy but he got me and\nso I got 26th out of whatever it was\nlike 1,500 people\nwe go guys the offside oh my god oh my\ngod\nother\nokay hands are frozen hands are frozen\nhere\nhi I'm frozen\neverything's frozen oh my god\nmy feet are good I had Bella toes on\nactually everything about me was was\ndecent it was just my hands completely\nnumb so then I go into the bathroom and\nI turn on the water and I just stick my\nhands and in like what essentially be\ncold water like I didn't really put on\nthe hot side it was ooze you know if you\nwere just normally you'd be like oh this\nis pretty cold water but since I was so\ncold it felt like it was piping hot and\nI just stuck my hands in there and\npretty much experienced very high levels\nof pain as I started to death ah I I was\nlike it was so painful that I tried to\nwalk around I kept walking around to get\naway from my hands because they were so\npainful but I couldn't get away from my\nhands so it's so funny because I'm just\nwalking around like ah my hands but once\nyou come out of that once you defy is\nthat you're full of all this I hate life\nbut when those feelings go away what's\nreplaced is just pure joy and just like\neuphoria and so then they had some food\nwhich they did have a vegan option they\nhad like this vegan bean thing that was\nreally delicious they had french fries\nand they had some kind of vegan salad so\nlike I was stoked I was eating that I\nhad some coffee\nshivering uncontrollably though just\nshivering like a splashing coffee\neverywhere\nI was so frigging cold and this is after\nI'm like starting to warm up just my\ncore body temperature just plummeted\nit was awesome like this erasers\nmechanical issues with their eyes\nwas the hardest part\nit was harder last year\na lot of guys lost their brakes like my\ncoach Tony he lost his brakes as well\nand he had to try to fix him\nI didn't lose brakes I had no\nmechanicals whatsoever I didn't even\nbring a tube with me I just thought if\nif my brake bike breaks down food would\nyou probably call it you know I'm not\ntrying I'm not trying to fix my bike in\nthe snow and the rain and the mud so but\nI didn't I had no issues the Grail has\nlike a two bar setup I didn't really use\nthe top bar very much I don't know it\nfelt great it's a good bike is very\nbeefy you know the Grail seems like more\nof a bike for single trail or some\nreally aggressive gravel road not not\njust like farm roads the the area which\nthis race is is phenomenal I'd love to\ngo back there when it wasn't snowing\nraining mud cold because I bet it's just\nsome of the best riding ever I will 100%\nbe back next year and I will be looking\nfor top ten for sure but if you're\nthinking about doing the Savannah I\nguess my takeaway is that it's honestly\nnot as technical as maybe it it was made\nout to be I was very worried about that\nsaid that a few times\noh there's in like two sections wasn't\nthat bad\nthere's a lot of climbing it's\ndefinitely a climbers thing but if you\nhave if you have power if you have\nendurance it's not that bad it's just\nthe weather it's just the elements so if\nI had really nice gloves on I might not\nhave had any issues whatsoever right\nbetter gloves makes this whole event and\nwhole experience ten out of ten but I\nreally like this one Ross spotted SIA\nhowever you say it phenomenal event next\ntime make it non snow\nbut I don't know I almost feel like the\nfact that it was snowing just makes it's\nsuch an amazing event like that that is\nthat is so much more a part of it is\nbattling the elements\nalso a huge thank you to my coach Tony\nfor coming out and hanging with me will\nfrom Clif Bar for arranging this whole\ntrip and getting me out there the rat's\npatoot SIA\nsorry if I'm butchering it yeah event\nphenomenal and Kanyon thank you for\ngetting me a bike last minute dude\nwhat's funny is that what I got done as\nas soon as I cross the finish line the\nguy from Canyon like ran over was like\npulling my stuff off the bike almost\nimmediately right like they were they\nwere like no extra miles is gonna be put\non this bike they they took it back from\nme real quick house kind of open maybe\nthat was let me take it home they did\nnot they did not anyway this is my first\ngravel race is a proper one thanks for\nwatching as always",

          "description": "Un percorso per mettersi alla prova: Jeroboam Gravel Franciacorta\n\nIn questo Vlog vi raccontiamo la Jeroboam Franciacorta 2022, percorso Magnum da 150km e 3200 metri di dislivello.\n\nPartenza da Erbusco, in Lombardia. I primi km sono quasi tutti su sterrato, tra vigneti e single tracks. Passaggio a Clusane a ridosso del Lago d’Iseo e poi tra le Torbiere del Sebino. A Sarezzo inizia la lunga salita di giornata, interamente asfaltata/cementata di circa 10km, verso San Bernardo e Corna di Sonclino a 1300, il GPM del percorso Magnum. Discesa veloce su asfalto verso Sonico. Altri passaggi per Odolo, Gavardo, Serle e alle cave di Botticino. A Brescia digressione urban, con salita al Parco del Castello e discesa di nuovo in città. Rientro a Erbusco su ampie strade sterrate passando attraverso qualche piccolo paese.\n\nQuesto itinerario gravel ci è piaciuto molto perché è impegnativo ma sempre scorrevole e tecnicamente molto accessibile. I punti più tecnici sono sempre in salita (mai pericoloso in discesa) e con un buon allenamento si percorre tutto in sella senza mai dover scendere e camminare. Un vero percorso gravel, esigente ma che regala panorami unici ed alterna con il giusto ritmo passaggi wild in mezzo alla natura a passaggi urban nelle città/paesi.\n\nConsigliamo pneumatici da 45mm. \n\nQui la nostra traccia: https://www.komoot.it/tour/953861779\n\nAbbiamo percorso questo itinerario cicloturistico con le nostre bici gravel 3T Exploro Racemax con single speed Campagnolo Ekar 38T e 9-42, cerchi 27.5 3T DiscusPlus i28 LTD, pneumatici Vittoria Mezcal 2.1” con AirLiner, borracce Jet Green di Elite da 550ml, portaoggetti Takuin di Elite e borse da bikepacking Internode 4L e Node2H di Miss Grape.\n\n0:00 Erbusco | Start\n2:40 salita GPM \n4:56 Checkpoint\n7:23 Brescia\n9:19 Erbusco | Finish \n\nATTREZZATURA: \n- 3T Bike Exploro Racemax\n- pneumatici Vittoria Mezcal 2.1”\n- Internode 4L di Miss Grape\n- Node2H di Miss Grape\n- maglia Supergiara Jersey Gravellata Sportful\n- bib Supergiara Bibshort Gravellata Sportful\n- calzini Matchy Socks Sportful\n- scarpe Fizik Terra Ergolace X2\n- casco Met Helmets Trenta Mips\n- occhiali Alba Optics Delta\n- sella Fizik Terra Argo X3\n- nastro manubrio Fizik Terra Bondcush 3mm tacky\n- borraccia Elite Jet Green 550ml\n- portaborraccia Elite Prism Carbon\n- portaborraccia Elite Pria Pavè\n- porta oggetti Elite Takuin 550 \n- luce anteriore Ravemen LR500S\n- luce posteriore Ravemen TR20\n- cover smartphone Eevye\n- eevyebag waterproof Eevye \n\nATTREZZATURA VIDEO e FOTO:\n- iPhone 13 PRO\n- GoPro Hero 9 Black\n\nSegui le nostre gravellate su: \n- INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/gravellata.cc/\n- SITO WEB: https://gravellata.cc/\n- FACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/gravellata.cc\n- KOMOOT: https://www.komoot.it/user/1542604803444\n\nRegistriamo le gravellate con Garmin Edge 830.\n\nMontiamo i video con Adobe Premiere Pro.\n\nMusica: Epidemic Sound \n\nScrivici a: gravellata@gmail.com\n\n#bicicletta #3TBike #gravel",

          "description": "Das Jeroboam Gravel-Event in Kärnten besuche ich immer wieder gerne - tolle Stimmung, Top-Organisation, nette Leute und vor allem großartige Gravel-Strecken rund um Villach und Richtung Karawanen sind ein toller Mix! (auch wenn das Wetter nicht immer mitspielt - auch dieses Jahr sind wir nicht ganz trocken geblieben...).\n\nMit dem Gravelbike (oder Hardtail) ist der teilweise technische Parcours ein großer Spaß, die extra Herausforderung bestand dieses Jahr aber darin, das Ganze mit dem brandneuen Brompton G-Line abzufahren. Die Jungs von der Brompton Junction Vienna haben mir das gerade erst vorgestellt \"Gravel-Klapprad\" in die Hände gedrückt und mir maximal noch Alles Gute gewünscht. Wie es mir dabei auf kleinen Reifen ergangen ist, seht ihr in diesem Video.\n\nUnd weil ein paar Video-Teile dem Regen zum Opfer gefallen sind, hab ich noch einen zweiten Teil an das Video drangehängt, in dem ich euch alle Details zum neuen Brompton G-Line mitgebe und eine erste Einschätzung, wofür und für wen das alles gut sein könnte!\n\nBesten Dank an dieser Stelle an das großartige Jeroboam Gravel (http://jeroboam.bike/locations/woerthersee/), die Brompton Junction Vienna und Citybiker (https://citybiker.at) für den Support!\n\n0:00 Jeroboam Gravel Kärnten\n4:49 Brompton G-Line\n\n\nBlog: https://www.169k.net\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/martin.granadia/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/169k.net/\nhttps://www.komoot.de/user/542870889051\nStrava: https://www.strava.com/athletes/4048595",
