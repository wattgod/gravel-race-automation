        "explanation": "Explicitly states \"THE EVENTS ARE NOT RACES\" but rather gravel challenges where \"Family and Fun courses are an opportunity to get started with gravel riding.\" When your event emphasizes accessibility over competition and targets newcomers, you're building participation rather than racing prestige."

The \"perfect location for a full family day\" includes on-site catering, bike shop, and Go Ape activities, though without competitive edge it's essentially a supported group ride."

      "community": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Designed with \"guaranteed places for women riders and families\" plus \"twenty bursary places for those on low income.\" One child per adult goes free, creating an accessible community rather than the hardcore gravel racing culture found at competitive events."
      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Target audience explicitly includes families and beginners seeking gravel introduction, with the Challenge Event \"for fitter riders or those with some gravel or off-road experience.\" The non-competitive format serves community building over attracting serious competitive depth."

      "value": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Professional course marking, GPX files, mechanical and medical support, plus timing for all riders through quality Forestry England terrain. The graduated distance options mean families and fitter riders can participate in the same well-supported event structure."

      "expenses": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Lake District location means typical UK tourism costs, though the Grizedale Forest site includes \"ample parking, toilets, on-site catering, bike shop and bike hire\" to contain some expenses. September timing avoids peak summer pricing but carries shoulder-season Lake District premiums."
