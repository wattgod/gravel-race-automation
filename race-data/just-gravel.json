Forestry England site delivers guaranteed parking, toilets, and post-ride cafe, but basic organization without the polish of established racing infrastructure."

        "explanation": "Three distance options from Family (~15km) through Fun (32km) to Challenge (45km), though the advertised 50-mile distance doesn't clearly align with the published route structure. Multiple options serve different abilities, but the distance confusion suggests organizational inconsistencies."

        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "All courses run on \"wide, well-surfaced gravel trails\" through Grizedale Forest with only \"a very short section of linking road\" on longer routes. Despite being described as having \"extreme terrain with frequent steep hills,\" the emphasis on smooth surfaces suggests manageable technical challenge rather than punishing difficulty."

      "elevation": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "4000 feet over 50 miles delivers solid climbing through Lake District forest terrain without being excessive. The course description mentions \"frequent steep hills and long sustained climbs,\" providing enough vertical challenge to test fitness while remaining accessible to gravel newcomers."
      },
      "climate": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "2025 riders finished \"before the storm rolled in,\" capturing the unpredictable nature of September weather in the Lake District. The forest setting in Grizedale provides some shelter, but timing matters when storms threaten in this famously wet region."
      },
      "altitude": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Southern Lake District elevation presents no altitude considerations for performance or acclimatization. You're dealing with proper hills and gradients, but at sea-level air density throughout the event."

        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Pure gravel through \"Forestry England's hidden gems\" in Grizedale Forest, described as \"best seen in autumn when the forest trails will be at their best.\" The traffic-free forest setting delivers proper Lake District adventure without requiring mountain rescue on standby."
      },
      "prestige": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Explicitly marketed as \"NOT RACES\" but rather gravel challenges for beginners and families. When your event emphasizes accessibility over competition and targets newcomers to the sport, you're building participation rather than racing prestige."
      },
      "race_quality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "No competitive structure or timing since these are explicitly \"not races,\" but the mechanical and medical support at feed stations shows proper event organization. The non-competitive format limits race quality assessment to route planning and rider support infrastructure."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Grizedale Forest is genuinely iconic Lake District terrain, so the setting delivers. The flexible route structure (Family, Fun, Challenge) lets you pick your poison. But September in the Lakes can be a coin flip weather-wise, and without competitive edge or standout features, it's basically an expensive group ride with better signage."
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Designed as \"a fully inclusive event\" with free child places and \"twenty bursary places for those on low income.\" The beginner-friendly, non-competitive format builds an accessible community rather than the hardcore gravel racing culture found at competitive events."
      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Target audience of families, beginners, and riders seeking gravel introduction rather than competitive racing. The explicit non-race format with multiple ability levels serves community building over attracting serious competitive depth or notable riders."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "For what you get — guided routes through quality Forestry England terrain, support infrastructure, and beginner-friendly organization — it's reasonable value for entry-level gravel experience. The multiple route options mean everyone from families to fitter riders can participate in the same event. Though without knowing actual entry fees, I'm giving them benefit of the doubt here."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Lake District location means typical UK tourism costs for accommodation, though on-site Grizedale Forest facilities help contain some expenses. September timing avoids peak summer pricing but still carries shoulder-season Lake District premiums for lodging and food."
