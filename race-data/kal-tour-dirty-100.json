The only reference found was a YouTube video titled 'DIRTY KANZA 100 Training \\ Newbie Gravel Grinder' which refers to the Kansas event now called Unbound Gravel."
      },
      "length": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "100 miles hits the sweet spot for gravel centuries - proper distance that demands respect without requiring overnight logistics. Long enough to separate fitness levels, short enough to finish in daylight and drive home same day. Longer than Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."
      },
      "technicality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Southwest Michigan gravel tends toward agricultural roads and rail-trails rather than technical terrain. The region's glacial geology creates maintained gravel surfaces with occasional sand patches - manageable on standard gravel setups without requiring specialized skills. Less technical than The Mid South."
      },
      "elevation": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "4,500 feet over 100 miles averages 45 feet per mile - rolling rather than mountainous terrain. Michigan's glacial landscape creates steady undulation without sustained climbs that would require alpine gearing or extended suffering. Less climbing than The Mid South."
      },
      "climate": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Michigan weather creates unpredictable conditions - spring mud season extends late, summer humidity builds, fall delivers ideal riding before winter shutdown. Lake effect generates microclimates that demand careful weather monitoring and layered clothing strategies. Similar climate challenges to SBT GRVL."
      },
      "altitude": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Kalamazoo sits around 750 feet above sea level in classic Midwest flatlander territory. Sea level lungs work fine here - altitude never factors into performance or training considerations for any Michigan gravel event. Lower altitude than Gravel Worlds — no thin-air concerns."
      },
      "adventure": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Michigan farmland delivers pastoral scenery through cornfields and rural roads but limited wilderness factor. The adventure comes from century distance rather than remote terrain or technical challenges - pleasant countryside without edge-of-your-seat exploration."
      },
      "prestige": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "No actual race by this name exists in the gravel community. The confusion appears to stem from a training video reference to Dirty Kanza (now Unbound Gravel) in Kansas, which has significant prestige in the gravel racing world."
      },
      "race_quality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Cannot evaluate race quality for an event that doesn't exist. The research revealed only a YouTube training reference and a motocross points series called 'The Dirty 100' - neither related to Kalamazoo gravel racing."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Kalamazoo area offers decent gravel potential with rolling terrain and rural roads that could support quality century rides. However, no organized 'Kal-Tour Dirty 100' event currently exists to provide that experience to riders."
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Michigan maintains solid cycling culture through groups like Kalamazoo Bicycle Club, and the area supports active gravel riding communities. However, this specific event name produces no community presence or race-specific discussions anywhere online."
      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "No competitive field exists for a race that doesn't actually happen. The YouTube video reference to 'DIRTY KANZA 100 Training \\ Newbie Gravel Grinder' points to the Kansas event, which does attract strong fields. Thinner field than Ouray Gravel Grinder."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Michigan gravel events typically offer reasonable pricing compared to coastal counterparts, and the region's cycling community supports accessible entry fees. However, you cannot register for an event that doesn't exist in any race calendar."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Registration runs $75-100. Kalamazoo provides decent access via I-94 corridor between Chicago and Grand Rapids with reasonable lodging costs outside peak summer season. Food and gas remain affordable, though travel expenses are moot without an actual event to attend. Similar expense level to Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."
