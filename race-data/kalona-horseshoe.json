      "climate": {
        "score": 2,

        "score": 1,

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "The Iowa Gravel Series knows how to put on a decent event with chip timing, marked courses, and aid stations with actual food. But with only 67 finishers showing in results and zero details on course features or technical sections, this feels more like a weekend club ride with numbers. The 'windy and rolly' description tells you everything - it's fine, not fantastic."

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Racing past horse-drawn buggies through Amish country delivers a unique backdrop you won't find elsewhere. The post-race pie is 'mandatory' according to promotion, and the scenery gets called 'captivating and quiet.' But 50 miles of Iowa gravel roads, however scenic, doesn't exactly create lasting memories or war stories."

      "community": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "\"Come for the race, stay for the amazing bakeries!\" captures the local flavor that draws teams like Goosetown Racing with multiple podium finishes. Starting at Kalona Historical Village adds authenticity, though the community remains grassroots intimate rather than energizing."
      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Results show at least 67 finishers with times stretching past 5 hours - this isn't attracting competitive depth. Jacob Nelson and Curtis Burton finishing within seconds of the winner suggests limited fast company. It's a small Iowa town grassroots event, not a destination race for serious competitors."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "$40-50 entry gets you chip timing, marked course, aid stations, photography, and post-race pie - that's solid grassroots value. The full season package at $399 for seven races, jersey, and meals works out to $57 per race including gear. No frills, but honest pricing for what you get."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Kalona sits in rural Iowa with no obvious nearby airports or hotel clusters. You're driving from Iowa City or Des Moines and finding basic accommodations. Cheap entry fees offset typical small-town travel logistics without big-city convenience."
