May in Iowa delivers the \"windy and rolly\" conditions that define this course. The emphasis on wind as a consistent feature rather than bonus challenge reflects the reality of spring racing on exposed Iowa farm roads. More weather exposure than Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "The Iowa Gravel Series knows how to put on a decent event with chip timing, marked courses, and aid stations with actual food. But with only 67 finishers showing in results and zero details on course features or technical sections, this feels more like a weekend club ride with numbers. The 'windy and rolly' description tells you everything - it's fine, not fantastic."

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Racing past horse-drawn buggies through Amish country delivers a unique backdrop you won't find elsewhere. The post-race pie is 'mandatory' according to promotion, and the scenery gets called 'captivating and quiet.' But 50 miles of Iowa gravel roads, however scenic, doesn't exactly create lasting memories or war stories."

      "field_depth": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Results show at least 67 finishers with times stretching past 5 hours - this isn't attracting competitive depth. Jacob Nelson and Curtis Burton finishing within seconds of the winner suggests limited fast company. It's a small Iowa town grassroots event, not a destination race for serious competitors. Thinner field than Ouray Gravel Grinder."

      "value": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "$40-50 entry gets you chip timing, marked course, aid stations, photography, and post-race pie - that's solid grassroots value. The full season package at $399 for seven races, jersey, and meals works out to $57 per race including gear. No frills, but honest pricing for what you get."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Registration runs $50-75. Kalona sits in rural Iowa with no obvious nearby airports or hotel clusters. You're driving from Iowa City or Des Moines and finding basic accommodations. Cheap entry fees offset typical small-town travel logistics without big-city convenience. Similar expense level to Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

He is sponsored cyclist with Velovit Elite, a team that just became a USA Cycling Domestic Elite Team. He's also a great person to interview. \n\nIn this episode of the podium podcast we dip into Michael's genesis story into cycling and his relationship with the Rouge Roubaix in St. Francisville, Louisiana. Then, we take some twists and turns into training, the human condition of challenging ourselves, and end questioning the utility of USA Cycling regulations. It's a good chat, so click play and enjoy getting to know Michael a little better.\n\nMichael: https://www.instagram.com/michaelvaughnlambert/\nVelovit Elite: https://www.instagram.com/velovit_elite/\n\nRouge Roubaix: https://www.rougeroubaix.com/",

and uh I know\nwe're going to talk a little bit about\nyour path to cycling and also a little\nbit about USA cycling and what that\nmeans for a gravel but um we we'll get\nin that to it eventually let's maybe\njust start off with where you know you\nyou grew up in Wisconsin tell us a\nlittle bit about that and how you got\ninto\ncycling yeah so I would say I took a\nsort of like non-traditional path um\ninto the sport you know I was a I was an\nathlete in high school and\num and then you know I really came to\ncycling kind of late I was uh 27 years\nold when I did my first race and I was a\ngraduate student at the time I was\nliving in the state of Alabama and so um\na friend of mine who I had met through\nsort of like the excuse me through like\nthe local Cycling Club um they would do\nlike these really difficult for me at\nleast at the time Tuesday night rides\nand they had a large group of people\nthat were really supportive uh the Druid\nCity Bicycle Club and that's kind of\nwhere it all started for me and this\nfriend of mine encouraged me to go and\ncheck out this race that was in\nLouisiana and that race is called rou Ru\nit's ort of modeled after the spring\nClassics and it was 106 miles uh and it\nwas my first race it was a USA cycling\nlike sanctioned event um still is they\nhad a brief Hiatus uh recently but they\ncame back and I have just like an\nincredible story about that race uh and\nthat is sort of like my creation myth as\na cyclist so if you'll indulge me yes\nplease I mean this is great go for it so\nso yeah this is\n2016 I am a cat 5 so if you don't know\nanything about the USA cycling whole\nlike a hierarchy right you start at cat\nfive and you can work your way all the\nway up into cat one category one and\nthat's like the closest thing to\nprofessional and so you you have to earn\npoints to get these upgrades throughout\nand um it's one way of sort of uh\nsplitting up the various skill levels\nand like Fitness levels into you know\nyou can think of it almost like age\ngroup uh you know categories and so I'm\nI'm at my first race as a category 5 and\nit's 106 miles and it's on mixed surface\nright it's like got big chunky gravel\nsections um this is again 2016 I knew\nyou know gravel racing was a thing at\nthis time but it wasn't such a huge\nfocus in the US cycling\nscene and so people people that were\nwinning Rouge rubet were racing it on\nroad bikes with like 25 millimeter tires\non these gravel roads right and uh so I\ngo and it was so exciting it was so long\nit was so difficult and I I wound up\nwinning the race in a Sprint in like the\nfinal 50 meters with one other Rider and\nI was immediately hooked right like it\nwas the most\num like profound experience if you if\nyou are at bike races and you just watch\npeople the Colona horeshoe is a great\nexample of this as well right you see\npeople crossing the finish line and they\nare just you know bursting at the seams\ntelling trying to tell the story of of\ntheir day because you go through this\nwhole range of emotions while you're out\nthere doing this physically challenging\npsychologically challenging\nthing and so I won that race I was going\nto school at Alabama at the time as I\nmentioned um for creative writing so I'm\na writer and after this race had taken\nplace I learned that they were having an\nessay contest and I thought this is too\neasy right like I'm going to be the guy\nthat writes the hell out of this essay I\nwon this race it was my first race so I\nwrite the essay I send it to the race\norganizers and I win the essay contest\nso they give me free entry into the next\nyear's\nevent and in that first year of cycling\nyou know technically I think with USA\ncycling's rules you're not supposed to\nbe able to move up multiple categories\nin one\nyear but I was doing really well I was\nkind of a natural and so I was you know\nwinning races I moved up by the next\nyear to category\nthree now this race being in the spring\nI'm training you know all winter long\nthinking about how strong these category\nthree Riders are going to be these guys\nare mon ERS there's no way I'm going to\nbe able to do well I really need to get\nfit and so I'm training like\ncrazy riding you know big miles uh on\nwhat was essentially a a carbon fiber\nlike uh crossbike a track\nBoon and I think it was at this time\nthat I also got my first set of like\ncarbon race wheels which changed things\nimmensely from like my aluminum box\nClincher Wheels were pretty heavy you\nknow that weren't very\naerodynamic and so I've got all the\nequipment that I need I go back to this\nrace as a category 3 and I was solo for\nthe last like 32\nmiles and I I won and I had to write\nanother essay about this race of course\nbut I thought that the chasing group was\nright behind me essentially that the\nlead vehicle was telling me the\nGap I'm on this section I remember this\nmoment it was like the low moment of my\nday psychologically I'm on this like\nblock headwind section I look down I'm\nin my small chain ring I'm just\ncrawling and I know I'm G to get caught\nand I'm going to crumple and the guy\ntells me that I have 90 seconds of a gap\nand there's like 10K left or something\nlike this and so I'm thinking that my\nday is kind of over and suddenly we take\na corner I've got a Tailwind I'm you\nknow doing like 25 miles an hour and\nwhen I crossed the Finish Line I had a\nfour and a half minute Gap uh to to the\nnext group right and so I think what had\nhappened was I was catching some of the\nguys that were in the Pro field that had\ngotten popped that were you know\ndangling and I think I had a 90 second\nGap maybe to one of those Riders who I\nhad dropped but I'm I'm glad that he\ngave me a too small estimate as opposed\nto a too large estimate because maybe I\nwould have right like rested on my\nLaurels instead of uh doubling\ndown but yeah so I won this race solo\nthe next year with this huge gap wrote\nanother essay uh wanted to go back the\nnext year and race in the Pro category\nand uh rou Ru goes on this\nHiatus and so was this Co was that a\ncotis\nor I think it was just like uh you know\nputting on a race is an incredibly\ncomplicated thing right like yeah you\nhave to get permits from the city 106\nmiles of a race right it's it's all all\nthroughout this County I think in\nLouisiana they're not called counties\nactually they're called parishes so it\nwas St feliciana Parish so there was\nconflict with the community and all of\nthese complications LED it to go on this\nlike fiveyear\nHiatus so I didn't get the opportunity\nto go back and do this third right from\nthe bottom to the top kind of uh winning\nalong the way right\nmy life goes through all kinds of\nchanges I'm living in Germany after\ngraduate school I'm racing in Europe uh\nI have a really bad crash I break my\ncollar bone I'm in the hospital for like\n10 days ultimately I came back to the US\ntook a teaching job here in my hometown\nat my alma modder kind of came full\ncircle and appreciated all that that\nrepresented right like that ex was\nexactly what I wanted to do at that time\nand and then I hear that Bay in\n2022 is coming back and so I know that\nI'm going to have to go back and race\nthis race right first time back now\nthey've changed the course it's 127\nmiles not and instead I think because of\nthe gravel uh the gravel like scene the\nburgeoning scene rather than having it\ncategor categorized and maybe even now\nnot sanctioned through USA cycling I\ndon't remember exactly that Det detail\nbut they had a mass start right everyone\nstarts at the same time 127 miles uh\ngood luck we'll see you at the finish\nline and I'm riding to the start of this\nrace I've been training the whole winter\nright just like before thinking about\nthis event it's in the early part of the\nseason\num\nand I\nthink I'm riding to the\nstart and I notied that my shifting is\nsomething's\nwrong uh I have at this time I had\nmechanical\nshifters and it's not going down my\ncassette like cleanly I know something's\nwrong I think my cable is fraying my\ncable's about to snap and I like don't\nhave time to fix it right I'm at the\nstart\nline and my my team director is there\nhe's out on course like at the feed\nZone uh we go out and I'm like you know\npreparing to go into this first gravel\nsection we're at like mile 25 we have\n100 miles to\ngo\nand because of this technical issue I am\nthinking I should go off the front while\nthings are\nchill get to the feed Zone and maybe\nI'll have time to fix it so that I I'll\nbe able to get back into the race and\nhave a chance at this right because like\nI know I'm not going to do well if my\nbike isn't\nworking so that happens\nlittle risky I mean you're you're going\nto if you're going to have to go strong\noff the the front you know you're you're\ngoing to burn some matches there early\nin the beginning and that's what\neveryone is thinking as I go off the\nfront solo right yeah H this guy's crazy\nthis is a Fool's errand why would we\nfollow this guy uh and so I go into the\nfirst gravel section solo I come out\nuh I'm heading towards the first feed\nZone and I'm thinking I'm texting my\ndirector right I need a shift cable meet\nme at the feed Zone he's found a\nmechanic he's found a cable the guy's\nready to change this thing out things\nare going\nsmoothly uh but I'm looking behind me\nand like no one's there and it hasn't\nsnapped this cable but it's not working\nright uh I get to the feed Zone I've got\nlike a two and a half minute Gap and so\nI'm like screw it we're going to run it\nand I didn't stop I had him put the\ncable and some small Allen Keys into a\nmusette bag so if it snaps right I can\nstop I can like adjust the limit screws\nI can get\nhome uh but I'm not going to let this\nGap go to waste and kind of poetically\nmaybe of course I'm biased but the cable\nfalls out of the bag right like I'm\nputting all this stuff in my pockets I\ndrop the cable in the middle of the road\nbut I have the Allen keys so if the\ncable snaps I can I can turn the limit\nscrews and I don't have to be in my\nlongest gear\nright so this break gets up to like four\nminutes and I am solo from mile 25 until\nmile\n107 I have run out of water Bert missed\nme at one of the feed stops I'm I'm like\ncracking big time I go from like 300\nwatts average down to like I'm sitting\nat like 250 Watts this is like just\nabove zone two for me right like clearly\njust drives me nuts because I know that\nmy zone 250 watts is not my zone 2\nthat's like closer to my FTP so I just\njust to give some folks context and if\nthey're they haven't uh haven't done\nmuch with the wattage me measurement\nthese are these are Big Watts but still\nyou're you're you're coming down in your\npower and I know what you're competing\nagainst that you know 300 400 watt just\nfor a time or or a thing so yeah keep\ngoing don't don't F don't get focused\ntoo much on the numbers Chris it's okay\nyou're doing\ngreat so so yeah I can tell things are\ngoing\ndownhill uh I get to this feed Zone at\nMile 107 my my director's there he hands\nme a musette bag with like a can of Coke\nit was like the best Coke I've ever had\nin my life I'm enjoying this I've got\nwater now and I hear the volunteers at\nthe feed Zone saying do you need\nwater and I'm thinking I've already gone\npast these people like who are they\ntalking to and all of a sudden I get\nswarmed right three guys have caught me\num I throw the can of Coke back to my\ndirector and latch on to the group that\nhad been chasing um so there's three of\nthese\nguys\nand in the third and final essay that I\nwrote about this experience it's at this\nmoment that something remarkable happens\nwhich is my cable snaps so now I'm in\nthis Chase group I've been caught I've\nbeen out front by myself all day covered\nin dirt right the lead vehicle has been\nkicking up huge clouds of dust as you\nknow as an Ian uh this is like a\ntrademark of vehicles out on these roads\nso I have it like in my teeth right like\nI can feel it in my mouth my legs are\nbrown uh my white socks on the fronts\nright totally destroyed uh and\nI'm stuck now in my longest gear the 11\nToth Cog on the rear and I have my big\nand small chain rink my front ailer\nstill\nworking and so the big climbs are behind\nus I'm lucky but I don't want the guys\nin this group to know that I have just\nsuffered this emergency mechanical so\nI'm kind of like hanging on but I'm not\nreally doing any work I think that they\nare looking at me and they're\nthinking uh well that's okay like he\nlooks pretty much toast right like\nthey're not threatened by my\npresence uh I'm trying to hide the fact\nthat I'm like pedling with this\nglacially slow cadence anytime the road\ngoes uphill and I'm in this ridiculous\ngear combination right you would never\nbe in your small chain ring and in your\nsmall rear Cog this is like cross\nchaining as they would say it's not\nefficient\nright\nand I somehow managed to hang on and I'm\nthinking you know at least I'll get\nfourth place you know all things\nconsidered all this stuff that has gone\nwrong um at least I'll be able to get\nfourth place in this big race that's\ngood enough I thought and here we are\ncoming into the finish the finish at\nthis race this year on this new course\nwas like a big cradle so we go downhill\nthen there's an uphill\nSprint winning an uphill Sprint with a\nbroken shift cable in your longest gear\nis like\nunlikely and uh I'm sitting fourth wheel\nof four riders coming into\nfinish and there are two Riders who know\neach other that are kind of drilling it\non the front as we go\ndown they open up their Sprint kind of\nearly I'm just tucked in I'm in my\nlongest gear keeping up I shift into my\nsmall ring and like kind of slingshot\neffect occurs and I win the race with a\nbroken shift cable and that is like the\nmost viewed YouTube video I've ever\nposted it's got like 20,000 views it's\nlike a 30 second clip um I almost get\nrun off the road by this guy and I win\nthe Sprint right you can't tell in the\nvideo that my shift Cable's broken and\nso it's an even better story and so\nRouge ruet where I started right 2016\nwin it as a cat 5 2022 I finally win it\nin the Pro\ncategory uh and I did it with a broken\nshift cable so that race to me just has\nthis whole uh like\nRich history and um yeah it's just a\nhell of a story I'm sitting at the\nFinish Line just repeating the words\nunbelievable unbelievable like I could\nnot believe that that had happened and\nyou're there I mean you're you're you're\nyou know you're the protagonist in this\nstory you're the one you're the one uh\nyou know experiencing all of this and\neven the the unbelief to you you're like\nI you know what how does that feel and\nthis is a I don't know if you've ever\nwatched listen to like NPR there's a\nthere's a podcast um how I built this\nand I feel like feel like the the\ncycling world needs like a how I raced\nthis and there's a question that he\nalways asks at the end where he's like\nhow much of cycling or how much of\nEntrepreneurship because he's always\ninterviewing entrepreneurs like how much\nof Entrepreneurship is uh hard work and\neffort and how much of it comes down to\nluck at least the success in it and uh\nand you get a variety of different\nanswers there but I'll ask you that\nquestion like when you think back to\nyour journey from that first uh rubet to\nthe second and then that third final one\nhow much do you think luck and Fortune\nand hard work and training and effort\nplayed into each of those\nraces yeah that's a good\nquestion\nuh I mean I think it's kind of a both\nthing you know it's hard to put like a\npercentage on it um obviously like\npreparation for an event like that is so\nimportant you can't do it without that\npart of it right the hard work\ncomponent um but you've got to have that\nand luck I think it has to be both I\nthink that you can prepare all you want\nyou can have bad luck on the day\nterrible luck right um changes the the\nplan that you have and you got to be\nadaptable and kind of roll with the\npunches you know I think there were\nmoments\nwhere I could have said you know well my\nbike isn't working maybe I should quit\num maybe I should stop do something\ndifferent and I think it\ntook um just like persistence and uh you\nknow not not giving up even if I had the\nopportunity like like in that story you\nknow at the first rest station right to\nstop there maybe would have made more\nsense um but you've gota yeah I guess\nsorry but but looking back then why not\nlike why why didn't you give up like\nwhat was it I mean there's plenty of\nvery logical reasons to say you know\nwhat not my race it's okay um maybe I do\nthis all too often so I'm like I'm very\nI'm very familiar with this conversation\nthat you know I'll have a big effort and\nI'm like you know what I have other\ncommitments are the things I'm doing you\nknow what today's not my race I'm going\nto like pull back or whatever and I'm\nI'm fine with that conversation for the\nmost part but you weren't in that moment\ndo you know you do you reflect back why\nwas was it because of your previous\nexperience that success early on or was\nthere something else driving you where\nyou're like no like whatever it is I'm\ngoing to push through there is no there\nis no this is not my day I'm going to\nmake this my day no matter what like you\nknow what that was I\nmean radical self-belief I don't know I\nthink like part of me is obsessed with\nuh the narrative that we construct right\nlike people talk about how deeply\npsychological these typ of events are\nhow much of it is in your head right\nthere's a joke about this in like the\nultra endurance scene which is that uh\n90% of the race is uh mental and the\nrest is all in your head right like\nwhich is to say that it's all right a\npart of this uh psychological internal\nthing as opposed to it being a from\nwithout right this thing that occurs to\nyou is something that you are actively\nparticip ipating in\nconstructing and\nso yeah like I could see myself even\nhaving handled that particular event\nlike totally differently depending on\nthe day and um all the context of your\nlife that you bring with you when you\ncome into an event like that you know so\nmaybe you're right maybe it was the the\nfirst the first race history the\nexperience of that the confidence that\ncomes with winning a big race you can\nkind of lean on that experience in the\nfuture when things don't go to plan\nbut but yeah I think luck is a part of\nit too right like my cable could have\nbroken at Mile 27 instead and now my day\nis effectively over and I'd be\nscrambling so so yeah did I mean you had\nan amazing three act play that's what\nyou had right I mean you and that I\nthink that I think you're so right about\nthe narrative and the and the and then\nthe mental part of it I I was just with\nfamily this last weekend and one of my\nnephews he uh he had a terrible accident\na couple years ago and that left him as\na quad quadr so he's he's in a\nwheelchair he has very limited mobility\nin his hands um he has a brother that I\nyou know it's just amazing and they they\nwork they're about a year apart uh maybe\n18 months apart and they uh they work\nvery well together and they support each\nother and it's it's a beautiful thing to\nwatch and I was talking to Evan about\nlike some some of the challenges and\nthings that he wants to do and um you\nknow where we left it is that and I and\nI think he he sees this and he's got\nsome really high lofty goals but even\nthough his body isn't available to do\nall that he wants his mind is completely\nthere and because all of these\nchallenges are like you said you know\n90% in your head and the other 10% uh in\nyour\nmental or whatever um uh there really is\nnothing that stops you beyond that the\nthe decisions that we make in our life\nto say I'm G to I'm going to stop or not\nand I think that I think that story\nabout the the the rud ret and your\nexperience and getting started there\nlike really highlights that in such a\nbeautiful way and it's hard though\nbecause when we're in the story we don't\nsee the third act usually we only see\nusually maybe the the the drama that\nwe're in right now and I think that's\none of the harder parts\nso stepping back a little bit um from\nall of this what what have you found\nthat you've done uh that's kind of\nhelped you keep context within your\ntraining within the the hard day-to-day\nstuff um maybe even getting tactical\nlike what what does your training\nroutine look like right now what are you\ndoing to make sure that you put in the\neffort to to overcome any sort of bad\nluck on that day um so what tell me\nmaybe a little bit about what what how\nyour training works and and how you you\nmanage it kind of the day-to- day yeah\nof course um I'm gonna take one thing\nthat you said in that question and I'm\ngonna sort of latch on to it you you\nwanted to zoom out\ncontext uh\nso going Beyond even the cycling thing\nwhere it all started for me really is\nuh a canoe trip that I took with my\nolder brother so this was in 2009 more\nthan a decade ago I was 21 years old I\ntook a semester off of college my older\nbrother and I right that connection uh\nwe got in a canoe just uh south of where\nwe live on the Mississippi River and we\ncanoed all the way to New Orleans it\ntook us 66 days on the river how many\nmiles is that 1468 miles still remember\nthat figure right that's how deeply\nmeaningful it was to me it changed my\nlife forever right and I think about uh\nthings that I said to people after rou\nRu that final time I'm with some of the\nvit club guys were hanging out at this\nAirbnb in St Francisville Louisiana and\nthey're asking me these types of\nquestions right now they're interested\nhow did you do that and I I told them I\nthink one of the reasons why had such a\nsuccessful history at that race is\nbecause it's so deeply meaningful to me\nit is along the banks of the Mississippi\nRiver right it's in the state that we\nwere canoeing towards at this one moment\nin my life\nand like that makes you so I think like\nstrong mentally to have that uh past\nexperience to lean on so that was a\ndifficult thing right like it was\nsomething that I thought maybe we\nwouldn't be able to do it was incredibly\nchallenging it was every day with\nsomeone in a tent on the river in a\ncanoe we got into fights right like we\nhad disagreements but we had this common\ngoal and so that taught me so\nmuch Flash Forward to now you know I I\nhave a coach I've had a coach for the\npast several years um I train every day\nusually I take uh two days per week that\nare kind of like rest days but I'm still\nriding like an hour on those days easy\num which is super important I think like\none of the pieces of advice that I give\nto to Young Riders um who are just\nfiguring it out is to not forget that\ncomponent I think for me when I was\ndoing it by myself it was easy to\novertrain like it was easy for me to go\non Long rides I loved that I loved the\nfeeling of like coming home totally\nspent and like eating my entire cupboard\nof food because food never tasted so\ngood right like you you have this\nvoracious hunger that you build from\nthat type type of thing so I loved that\nI had no issues like being motivated to\npush\nmyself but I needed a coach to help me\nfigure out how specifically I should do\nthat and and how to rest also that's\nlike the part that I think it's\noverlooked yeah well it's\nso it's funny we we talk about people\nwho I mean you think about maybe in a\nfinance set sometimes we we get in these\nhabits where we'll like we'll spend\nevery dollar that we have and I feel\nlike Fitness and a lot of ways is is\nthat way as well we we start to build a\nlittle bit of fitness and then we spend\nit you know right away because it's fun\nit's exciting we're doing new things but\num being able to bank that Fitness being\nable to rest be able to to to kind of\nhold back a little bit and also to um\nkind of live on a on a budget so that\nyou're not you know eating all that food\nat the end but we're learning how to\nfuel along the way and teaching our body\nthat yes there's going to be fuel right\nnow so you don't have to freak out like\nthere's there's going to be food and so\nthere's a lot of teaching your body that\nhey I'm you're in an okay place so go\nahead and keep building those muscles\nkeep building that strength and and\nthings is is super important and it\ndoesn't come intuitively and I'm I've\nhad I haven't I haven't never had like\nan actual fullon coach but I appreciate\nthe the coaching and the routines and\nthe and the the folks I've worked with\num to do that because you you just so\nquickly can uh lose what you've gained\nor or essentially overspend and not\nreally invest in a wealth of of uh\nFitness yeah I mean a couple of things\nright like the science tells us uh\nhaving a coach will make you better\nright just literally someone watching\nwhat you're doing uh will encourage you\nmotivate you in different ways it's like\nhaving a workout buddy or something\nright you're going to be less likely to\nnot show up um and another thing I would\nsay is that idea of having a budget and\nnot spending all the money you have I\nwould say that that's also uh useful in\nthe race right like learning to be\npatient you might be feeling great\nyou're feeling like a million bucks at\nMile five how are you doing it mile 995\nright like are you still going to have\nit then and learning how to be patient\nis super important in terms of tactics\nand all that other stuff so yeah all\nright so moving kind of into the\nbusiness side of this and I like uh M\nMichael I I would love if there's a way\nthat we can figure out how to get you to\ndo a uh a blog post on the Iowa gravel\nseries at some point I like I love your\nstorytelling um my undergrad is in\nEnglish but I don't get to use it quite\nas creatively as it seems like you get\nto do so there's so much that I would\nlove to learn and dip into uh but one\nthing I wanted to talk about was USA\ncycling and your experience there um we\nhad a a brief chat ahead of time about\nhow you know cycling has changed and in\nyou know uh you mentioned uh being much\nmore of a crit and\ncyclocross uh racer and you know gravel\nis great and growing and exciting in the\nUS but you know you it's hard when you\nmaybe want to do those types of races\nand there's just as many options or or\nthings but um I I want to give you a\nlittle context about my experience with\nUS cycling because of it was I started\nthe I did my I put on my first r\nin September of 2020 I announced it like\nthe first week in March of 2020\nand right the second week the second\nweek in March the you know the whole\nworld shuts down and I'm like no I'm not\ncanceling this ride i' I've put too much\neffort into trying to figure out like\nhow the heck do you do the insurance and\nlike organize and put together I like\nI'd put too much into it and so did that\nfirst race in 2020 of September and then\ngot done with that and I was like no\nthis is fantastic I love this but the\nonly way to I think maybe to make it\nwork is to do more like if it was just\none race it for me it was going to be\nmuch harder and so I'm like okay I'm I'm\ngoing to do a series and fast forward a\nlittle bit once the world started coming\nback to normal USA cycling start saying\nokay well we're we're going to get into\ngravel MH and had some good really great\nconversations with some great folks\nthere and the conversation kind of ended\nwhen I basically said they asked they're\nlike hey would you be interested in\ndoing more with USA\ncycling what I my response for good or\nfor bad was like my audience isn't like\nmy Racers aren't asking me to do\nthat and that that response I you know I\nstand by it right now but is something\nthat I reflect back on more with like\nokay is there something more that the\nGrassroots gravel World should do more\nwith organizations like USA cycling it\nyou know it's it's hard because there's\nthis there's this um this tension\nbetween the two groups and what they're\ntrying to do but as we look at the iog\ngravel Series in terms of being having\nseveral races being kind of a similar\nformat uh consistently across the board\nwe're looking at adding points and\nthings like that I'm I'm starting to\nthink like what does what does that mean\nto be Grassroots and to do some of these\nthings that are very racer focused not\nnecessarily just strictly you know\nCommunity focused and and how would that\nmaybe relate to US cycling so with that\ncontext I guess my question is if you do\nyou think every race should be USA\ncycling and if so why and if\nnot what are some good reasons in your\nmind why something should not be\nsanctioned like give me give me kind of\nyour your view from it as someone who\nhas excelled and gotten a lot of\nmotivation from this categorized style\nof writing that has helped you have this\nbeautiful story uh of of going from cap\nfive to Pro and and seeing the value in\nthose experiences so I'm I'm curious\nwhat you would teach me would what what\nthoughts you have there so to preface my\nresponse I have to I have to mention the\nfact that I have never organized an\nevent myself right I don't have that\nperspective on things um I think you\ncould teach me a lot uh from the things\nthat you have learned as a result of\nhaving done this from my perspective as\na writer I can totally see uh the\nbenefit of having sort of like a\nstructure and\norganization the categorized system as\nyou mentioned right like really I think\nwas a benefit to me because it prevented\nme from having to race against the\nfastest people out there on my first day\nright that was I think a huge Plus for\nme as a\nwriter\num however I can also see there being a\nton of benefits to having the freedom to\nnot have to adhere to a set of uh\nregulatory right like rules and\nguidelines that a governing body that\ndoesn't even maybe know who you are or\nuh right they have nothing to do with\nrural Iowa gravel yet they want to tell\nyou how you ought to do your event right\nlike I can see that being um not that\nuseful\nalso um to add to that right like my\nmost recent race I had a chance to go to\num to USA cyclings us pro-al Road Race\nFor the First\nTime\nand here is a little seed of a story\nthat I think\nexemplifies uh the wrongheadedness that\nI think is the reason why some people\nare critical of governing bodies in\ngeneral like the UCI or like USA\ncycling so I'm wearing an ice vest I'm\nin Charleston West Virginia I'm at the\nstarting line of the biggest race that\nI've ever done in my life this was less\nthan a week ago this was on Sunday it's\nWednesday this was on the 19th of May\nI'm wearing this ice vest I'm wearing my\nteam Jersey underneath of the icefest\nbut it is the Wisconsin State uh\nChampions version of my team jersey so\nit's white it's got this blue stripe on\nit it has the Wisconsin emblem from\ntheir flag it's on it's on the V vitore\nElite Instagram page it looks great I'm\nlooking at it right check it out it's a\nbeautiful Jersey right I was so proud to\nto represent my home state at this\nevent um I was so stoked that my team\nlike helped construct this jersey for me\num it's the first time I've gotten to\nwear a state champions Jersey uh in a\nrace and at this type of race it was\njust like an incredible experience right\nso I'm taking this Ice Fest\noff and there's this guy who knows who I\nam I think he was a director of a\ndifferent team um I'm not going to say\nthe name of the team but he asks me is\nthat Jersey ucci\ncompliant and I'm thinking are you\nserious like I I don't\nI don't know um are you about to break\nout the rule book is this where your\nhead is at like here I am at the start\nof this huge event you're worried about\nwhether my jersey is Rule compliant that\nto me is the reason why people dislike\nregulatory bodies they're they're\nworried about maybe the wrong things you\nknow so yeah I I get it like I get why\num people are critical of things like\nUSA cycling I think in some cases it's a\nnecessary um right like institution in\nthat they can provide structure and\nwrite rules for things but yeah I I get\nkind of both sides so yeah yeah now that\nI think that's a I think that's a good\nexample of like all right what you know\nwhat does cycling mean to folks and and\nand to be fair cycling means a lot of\nthings to a lot of people as it should\nit's one of the most it's it's I think\nwhat's makes it so beautiful about being\non a bike is cuz it can be as fast as\nyou want it can be as slow as you want\nit can be as challenging as you want it\ncan be as uphill or as flat it can be as\ncommunal or as solo like you it's it's\nuh it's I think just the closest you\nknow in a lot of ways it's the it's the\nmost human tool that we have for\ntransportation that uh you know gives us\nall the efficiencies that that we can\nwithout you know getting straight up\ninto Motors and stuff and people who\nlove e bikes I love e bikes as well I\nknow there's an ebike in my future at\nsome point so nothing against that by\nany means and so um yeah I I I think\nabout where the gravel series the Iowa\ngravel series is going and and what we\nwant to do in the future a lot and so I\nappreciate kind of that that input uh\nthere or that that that idea is like how\ndo we how do we maybe encourage and even\npartner or do whatever we can to bring\nthe best parts of cycling to the\nForefront um try those use those um and\nif it makes sense to to work with\norganizations that have those structures\nmaybe uh if it doesn't you know for the\nfor the most part I think what we're\ntrying to do is make it you know our\nMantra has been let's have a great day\nin the saddle like that's that's the\npoint of it and for for for for folks\nthat really want to be on the podium and\nthey're excited about that we hope that\nwe provide it and for those who like no\nI just want to go to the coolest\ninteresting weirdest parts of Iowa then\nyeah let's let's go and do that um tell\nme a little bit of before we're probably\nshould wrap up here a little bit not\nbecause I want to but because of like\nthe limitations of time um tell me a\nlittle bit about V it and how you've\ngotten involved with them and uh and and\nwhat they're doing as an organization\nyeah um it's a it's a wonderful team\nit's a wonderful group of of human\nbeings you know um basically my M with\nthem got started way back uh in Alabama\nit is based in Jackson Mississippi\nthat's kind of home based for them that\nwe have writers spread out all over the\nUS\num so you know I told you about the\nDruid City Bicycle Club uh this local\nCycling Club in\nTuscaloosa and I had actually a former\nstudent he showed up in this scene I am\na graduate student teaching uh English\nclasses at the\nUniversity um\nhe and I would go to battle every\nTuesday we would throw Haymakers at each\nother until one of us gave up basically\nwe got so strong uh it's the benefit of\nhaving like fast people that you can\nride with that you can uh push yourself\nagainst his name was Davis Adams and uh\nDavis is now uh graduated I think he's\njust recently passed the bar exam he's a\nlawyer he's doing great uh I don't think\nhe rides his bike much anymore but\nthat's maybe something that he will come\nback to in the future but basically\nDavis raced for this team when I came\nback from Germany he asked you know if I\nhad um anything lined up if I was uh\njoining a team and uh he knew who I was\nfrom that experience on Tuesday nights\nand so he got me onto this team and I've\nbeen with him since uh 2020 since since\nuh covid years and um they have a pretty\nbig footprint I would say in like the\nsoutheast in\nparticular and uh especially with the\nclub uh part of the team you know\nthey're getting people on bikes they're\nthey're providing them with a community\nthat is a huge component of um you know\nwhat you can grow out of right like you\nyou you you're welcomed into this\ncommunity you don't really know what\nyou're\ndoing I think of that Druid City\nbicycling Club when I didn't really know\nanything about like how to ride in a pce\nline um about what was the appropriate\nsock height just kidding you know it\ndoesn't matter what length of socks you\nwere um but but I learned so much and I\nlong as it's not an ankle sock right as\nlong as it's not an ankle sock yeah I\nmean maybe the knee or something that we\ncould talk about more but uh anyways\nthat Community aspect of it is so\nimportant and I think without that you\ndon't get the elite Riders you know so I\nthink that speaks to um one of the\nthings that's so important to gravel\nracing too which is is like all Commerce\nright like everyone please like no\nmatter what your level of um\nparticipation or interest you have a\nplace here I think that is like so\nnecessary like\nfundamentally to the sport growing and\nlike being a place where people feel\nlike they\nbelong so uh so yeah vit is great like\nwe have this elite team now that is uh\ngoing to like the biggest events in the\nUS we have like a domestic elite team\nlicense which gave me access to compete\nat Pro\nNationals um we are going to have like a\nfull Squad at Tulsa which is like you\nknow uh they they call it critmas uh\nlike a spin on Christmas it's where\neveryone goes it is like the world\nseries of crit racing in the US and so\nwe are bringing a full team there um I\nwon that race we as a team won that race\nlast year in the category one two and\nthat was like the biggest thing I'd ever\ndone on the bike for sure just\nincredible and um the level is extremely\nhigh literally like guys from all over\nthe world come to that event um there\nwas like a German team there was I mean\nthere's yeah it's it's truly like\nInternational in scope um kind of like\ngravel racing right crit racing is also\na sort of specifically American thing\nand so this is a huge event and um yeah\nI couldn't be more stoked about like how\nthat team has supported me and helped me\ngrow um as a\ncyclist awesome very cool yeah that that\nCommunity is a huge aspect of it and\nhowever you find it you know there's\nplenty of different groups I think uh\nfor that but finding the team that helps\nyou develop in the goals that you want\nto have or inspires you to where you\nwant to be I think is so important you\nknow you can find that in a lot of\ndifferent ways but the goal is to find\nthe thing that you're like this is this\nis what I want this is what this is\nwhat's taking me to where I want to go\num yeah I think it always for me has\ncome back to the people right like uh\nsurrounding yourself with people that\nsupport you and that you can uh work\ntogether to reach your goals like um you\nknow thinking about even like at the\nheight of competition I'm in this us pro\npro road race or whatever right right\nand I'm racing against guys that I have\nknown for years and it's like it's\ncompetitive right like we're racing\nagainst each\nother but beyond that we're like human\nbeings that support each other in a lot\nof ways so um remembering that maybe\neven In the Heat of the Moment you know\ncompetition is good pushing each other\nright that's that's all what it's all\nabout but um there are bigger things\nthan bike races too and it's like\nremembering that to be a to be a good\nhuman being to one another is I think\neven more important than any bike race\nright you got to be the yeah you know\nbuild that human inside of you uh and\nand do the right things and and build\nthose relationships and that love even\nif your jersey isn't sanctioned right\neven if even if even if even if your\nsocks are the wrong height you know you\nyou are still a human being underneath\nof the socks yeah yeah Focus there well\nwell Michael this has been fantastic I\nreally really really need you to come\nback and race with us again so we can\nput you on the podcast again because I\nwould love to keep chatting with you but\nlet's go ahead and wrap up for tonight\num thank you again um is there anything\nthat you would really encourage people\nto go and and and look at right now\nanything you're like hey if you know\nwhat one thing to maybe go uh promote or\nsay Hey you know go go check this\nout if you are racing gravel in the\nstate of Iowa you have to go to

The race includes feed zones for mechanical support and nutrition. Riders discuss pacing strategies, with early solo breakaways being considered risky but potentially rewarding if gaps can be established. The event attracts riders from across the Midwest, with some traveling from Wisconsin and other neighboring states. Race morning logistics include packet pickup the night before. The course appears to have some climbing despite initial expectations of flat terrain. Weather conditions have been described as beautiful with great turnout from the cycling community."
