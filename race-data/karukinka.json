Snow fell all night before Stage 2, forcing a one-hour start delay for temperatures to rise. Antonio Ortiz battled \"wind, one of the cyclist's greatest enemies, often blowing head-on\" while organizers warn conditions \"can change rapidly in Tierra de Fuego\" from cold and snowy to warm and sunny. Patagonian wind often exceeds 100 km/h throughout stages. Harsher conditions than Grinduro California."

Riders must bring sleeping bags for communal gym accommodations and basic mountain lodges.

More expensive than Atlas Mountain Race."
