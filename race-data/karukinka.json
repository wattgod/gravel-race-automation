The course follows the military-built Ruta Vicuña-Yendegaia through hairpin-filled mountain passes and forests. Riders get exclusive access to 10km of unopened road sections built by Chilean Army engineers at one kilometer per year. More technical than most — comparable to Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

Snow fell all night before Stage 2, forcing a one-hour start delay for temperatures to rise. Antonio Ortiz battled \"wind, one of the cyclist's greatest enemies, often blowing head-on\" while organizers warn conditions \"can change rapidly in Tierra de Fuego\" from cold and snowy to warm and sunny. Patagonian wind often exceeds 100 km/h throughout stages. Harsher conditions than Grinduro California."

Whether this justifies the likely substantial cost depends on your appetite for extreme adventure tourism."

Riders must bring sleeping bags for communal gym accommodations and basic mountain lodges. The multi-day logistics package through completely remote terrain with full support, meals, and exclusive road access will command premium adventure tourism pricing. More expensive than Atlas Mountain Race."

          "description": "Rodeado de paisajes que parecen sacados de un sueño de otro mundo. La Karukinka Gravel Race, no es solo una carrera. Es una vivencia a través de la Patagonia, un viaje al fin del mundo.\n\nUn punto austral del planeta, donde el mar y las montañas se funden en un entorno salvaje, y puro. Tierra del Fuego. Aquí, el concepto de “isolación” adquiere una nueva dimensión. Los caminos serpentean entre bosques de lenga, ríos, lagos, montañas cubiertas de nieve y grandes estepas que se abren ante los participantes, son una belleza extrema difícil de definir.\n\nLo más impactante de la Karukinka Gravel Race, no es solo el paisaje sobrecogedor, sino la sensación de estar en el fin del mundo, en un lugar donde por suerte, aún son pocos los que se atreven a llegar. La sensación real, es de estar recorriendo un rincón remoto de la Tierra.\n\nEl viento, uno de los mayores enemigos del ciclista, a menudo de cara, empuja con fuerza y parece querer arrebatarte cualquier esperanza de llegar al destino. Los cielos nublados se despejan momentáneamente, revelando montañas que parecen tocadas por la mano de los dioses. El terreno es impredecible: pistas interminables destapadas, como les llaman ahí, dan paso kilómetro tras kilómetro, a una imágenes que mejora la anterior.\n\nLa llegada a la meta, no es solo un momento de triunfo físico, sino también emocional. No era solo el final de una carrera, sino el cierre de una nueva experiencia en lugar insólito que marca un antes y un después.\n\nLa Karukinka Gravel Race en Tierra del Fuego no es solo una prueba de ciclismo. Es una inmersión en la naturaleza en su forma más pura y majestuosidad del planeta en el que vivimos.\n\n¡Vívelo!, que no te lo cuenten.\nAntonio Ortiz 📝\n\nSígueme en Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/antonioortizbike",

          "description": "KARUKINKA GRAVEL RACE\nEn este vídeo os quiero contar mi experiencia en la Karukinka Gravel Race, una carrera de ciclismo gravel que se celebra en el extremo sur de la Isla Tierra del Fuego, en Chile.\n\nEsta carrera es una auténtica aventura. Los participantes recorren más de 400 kilómetros de caminos poco explorados, rodeados de naturaleza virgen y paisajes espectaculares.\n\nYo tuve la oportunidad de participar en la segunda edición de la carrera, y fue una experiencia inolvidable. El recorrido es exigente, pero las recompensas son increíbles.\n\nEn el vídeo os mostraré algunos de los momentos más destacados de mi participación en la carrera. Veréis paisajes impresionantes, como el glaciar Martial, el Parque Nacional Karukinka o el Cabo de Hornos. También conoceréis a otros participantes de la carrera, y os contaré cómo fue mi experiencia personal.\n\nSi os apasiona el ciclismo gravel y os gustan las aventuras, este vídeo es para vosotros. ¡No os lo perdáis!\n\nCupón de descuento para productos Crown 11% de descuento y envío gratuito:  CROWNTASTIC\nhttps://crownsportnutrition.com/tienda/\n\nHerramientas Eltin: https://eltincycling.com/es/1023-herr...\nhttps://bit.ly/3GfAqkN\n\nLubricante y limpiadores\nhttps://www.x-sauce.com\n\nLinks de afiliado para apoyar al canal:\nRopa Castelli: https://bit.ly/3VOORSH\nCubiertas Chaoyang: https://bit.ly/3wscGIT\nLuz frontal: https://amzn.to/3r1nFmO\nLubricante X-Sauce: https://amzn.to/3CgWDxu\nPower Bank: https://amzn.to/3CmRQL0\nBomba de Carbono Topeak: https://amzn.to/3vTvdul\nInsta 360 x3: https://amzn.to/3Fa93bj\nBolsa Apidura: https://cutt.ly/Z3v7smJ\nBomba Eltin: https://cutt.ly/a3v7hnd\nAlicates herramienta: https://amzn.to/3Ip0yvW\n\nMis redes sociales:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/oscar_pujol/\nhttps://twitter.com/oscarpujol\nhttps://www.facebook.com/oscar.pujol\nhttps://www.strava.com/athletes/1885678",
