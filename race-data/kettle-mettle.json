Instead, I grabbed my drone and DSLR and followed my wife Catherine and our friends Karen and Steph as they took on one of the most scenic and challenging gravel races in British Columbia.\n\nIn this video, I reflect on what it means to train—and stay active—in your 60s, the physical and mental benefits of gravel riding for older athletes, and why missing the race didn’t mean missing the point.\n\nWith stunning race-day footage, rider stories from the course, and honest reflections on aging, health, and endurance, this is more than a race recap—it’s a celebration of movement, resilience, and gravel cycling at any age.\n\n🚴‍♂️ Featured Ride: Kettle Mettle Gravel Medio (~60km, 800m climbing)\n🎥 Shot with: DJI Drone + DSLR\n📍 Location: Okanagan Valley, British Columbia\n\nThinking about riding gravel in your 60s?

          "transcript": "I had trained for months to race the\nkettle medal, but when race day came, I\nwasn't on the start line. I was sick\nagain. So instead of racing, I grabbed\nmy drone and camera, and what I captured\nreinforced the way I think about gravel\nriding in my 60s.\n[Music]\nI've been deputized today to take videos\nduring the event.\nNo pressure. Why are you taking video?\nBecause Jeremy's too sick to race today.\nI'm very looking forward to this. Good.\nA ride in Canada. Day out with a good\nfriend. Perfect. Okay. I've given\nCatherine the GoPro today. I'm It's too\nmuch for me. I'm\nvery very afraid. I'm not optimistic. I\nthink that's one of the things I really\nlove about these events that uh Dean is\nputting on is they're really grassroots.\nThey're quite lowkey. There's a magic to\nrace morning. The quiet tension, the\nlast minute gear checks, the nervous\nlaughter. Even though I wasn't racing,\nbeing in that energy again reminded me\nwhy we come out for these events even in\nour 60s. The 50 km event has just\nstarted. We got a group of about 50\npeople like to see us safe and sound\nback at our finish line.\nSo 50 km. The kettle medal isn't a race\nfilled with pros. It's full of real\npeople, some in their 30s, many of them\nin their 50s, 60s, and beyond, pushing\nthemselves on gravel for their own\nreasons. Health, joy, adventure, or\nsimply to prove they can still do it.\n[Applause]\nHow you doing?\nThe kettle metal medio which was\nadvertised as a 50 kometer gravel fondo\nstarts with a deceptive calm wide gravel\nflats and quiet countryside but soon\nenough the climbs hit.\ngravel gets a little looser, the climbs\nget a little punchier, and you are\nexposed to long stretches that really\ntest your legs and your mindset.\nWatching Catherine ride with Karen and\nSteph was a highlight. Three individuals\nin their 60s tackling this course with a\nmix of determination, humor, and let's\nbe honest, a little cursing on the\nclimbs.\nI don't know if I'm taking my picture.\nLet me Sh.\nchase me\nlike\nthis.\nI think everybody was surprised by this\ncourse. Certainly, Catherine and I were\nunder the impression that a good portion\nof this ride was going to be on the KVR.\nAs it turns out, um, only a small\nportion was on the KVR.\nThe ride took riders up on Forest\nService roads up in behind Princeton and\nthey turned out to be absolutely\namazing. The gravel was pristine and the\nviews of Princeton and the surrounding\narea was just spectacular.\nGreat work.\nGetting sick again was hard. It's one\nthing to miss a ride,\nanother to miss a race. But these\nmoments remind me movement is medicine.\nEven watching from the sidelines, I felt\nconnected to Catherine and Steph and\nKaren.\nYou're making me smile. That's a good\nthing. I'm dying, but you're I'm\nsmiling.\nHow's everyone doing?\nYou're almost at the front of the pack.\nWe tried to rope in our head.\nThe thing I love about gravel riding is\nit keeps you sharp. It improves balance.\nIt builds leg strength and keeps the\nheart working without pounding on your\njoints. It challenges your mind, too.\nevery descent, every route decision,\nevery shift in terrain. And I do have to\nsay this kettle metal course really was\nspectacular. I was surprised at just how\nvaried the terrain was and just how\nchallenging the course was.\nHere we go. It's so beautiful.\nThere's no one type of gravel rider. I\nwas surprised at the number of older\nriders that I saw taking part in this\nrace. The point is speed is not part of\nthese types of gravel events. It's just\nabout showing up and getting in a good\nworkout. I think that's why Catherine\nand I have really enjoyed the shift from\ntriathlon over to gravel riding. There\nisn't that same pressure or\ncompetitiveness. People are obviously\nthere just to get out into nature and to\nhave fun. That's what's so appealing\nabout gravel riding.\nAnd to do a course like this where\nyou're introduced to new roots that\nreally are amazing is quite special.\nThe medio and long course eventually met\nup and I had an opportunity to see some\nof the long course riders really zipping\nthrough the course.\nEven moderate gravel riding gives your\nheart a good workout. It keeps your\ncardiovascular system strong without\npounding or the impact of running or\njumping.\nIt's not just your legs that get a\nbenefit. Your brain gets a boost as\nwell. Cycling is linked to sharper\nthinking, less anxiety, and even a lower\nrisk of cognitive decline. It improves\nmemory, focus, and overall cognitive\nfunction. Regular aerobic activity has\nbeen shown to delay even prevent\ndementia and Alzheimer's.\nand it reduces anxiety, depression, and\nimproves the mood through endorphin\nrelease. Getting out and riding with\nyour friends is incredible medicine.\nBecause cycling is a low impact sport,\nit lets older riders build strength and\nendurance without the joint pain that\noften comes with other sports.\nIt's a smart jump.\nIt's a high\nsmile.\nCycling strengthens legs, glutes, hips,\nand core muscles, areas that naturally\nweaken with age. It helps maintain\nmobility, coordination, and posture.\nGravel riding specifically challenges\nstabilizing muscles because of uneven\nterrain. Every climb and corner\nactivates the muscles that help you stay\nbalanced, upright, and strong on and off\nthe bike. Cycling enhances\nproprioception. It strengthens\nstabilizers in the feet, ankles, knees,\nand hips. Cycling improves the\nneuromuscular connections that help\nprevent falls. And balance is one of the\nfirst things we lose as we age. But\ncycling trains it gently, consistently,\nand in realworld conditions. Regular\naerobic exercise helps to regulate the\ncircadian rhythms. It promotes deeper,\nmore restorative sleep, and it can\nreduce sleep apnnea symptoms and\nnighttime restlessness.\nRide more, sleep better. It's really\nthat simple. Regular movement helps your\nbody wind down at the at night and stay\nalert during the day. And of course,\nregular exercise on the bike helps with\nweight management. From Las Vegas,\ncongratulations.\nAnd timing is everything. Carrie Payne\nfrom Las Vegas. David Kak from View\nRoyal BC along with Fran Mlan from View\nRoyal BC.\nCongratulations.\nAnd Mike Miller, Cal, Montana. Welcome\nto the finish line.\nat the finish line. That's racer 49\njoining us doing the pull from New\nWestminster. Michael McLaclin, Patrick\nMcCabe, all from Alberta.\nCongratulations to Lizanne Averil and\nTanya Averil\njoining us. Congratulations for getting\nthat media fondo done from Brag Creek.\nperformance. Racer number 14, Gareth\nCowwood\nrocking it out of\nAnd once again, another person from Brag\nCreek. We've got Mike. Hey, he's the\nmarathon guy. He can do it all. That's\ngoing to be Mark Relations.\nSo happy to have you with us at the\nfinish line. That's uh going to be\nwe had Stephan Muns out of Brag Creek\nand Bob Shaw out of Summerland.\nNumber one, number 15, Luke Charleswood.\nHeard you had a few tales of misfortune,\nbut super to have you here. That is\nMichael Bianis. Beautiful color bicycle\nnumber 41. That is past Landry out of\nPort Moody. By the time Karen and Steph\nand Catherine crossed the finish line,\nthey had been out on the course for a\nlittle over 4 hours. Um, I think they\nwere all pretty pleased with their ride.\nAll three of them agreed that they\nweren't really out there to race, but\njust to enjoy the event. And I think\nthey all came back with big smiles on\ntheir faces. I think that's really one\nof the advantages to racing.\nIt gives you something to work towards.\nIt's an awful extreme way of getting a\npair of souls. I think someone was\nsuffering in the last we bit. Sore\nshoulders, sore legs, sore arms, sore\nhands, sore neck. Other than that, it\nwas awesome. That downhill bit was\nfantastic.\nIf you like this video, please give it a\nthumbs up. Consider subscribing to the\nchannel. And until we ride again, take\ncare.",
