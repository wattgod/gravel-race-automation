The downside: no specific race logistics data exists, which makes planning a guessing game."

        "explanation": "Elite men like Brian Megens finish the 47.2km Austrian course in 55:08 at 50.59 km/h average, while recreational riders target around 1:08:00. Sixty-five miles translates to a proper gravel distance that hurts without the death march commitment of century rides. It's long enough to separate fitness levels but manageable for undertrained riders willing to suffer. Similar distance to Crusher in the Tushar."

      "technicality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Dr.hannibal reports \"the first half is rather flat or flows smoothly\" before hills that \"can really hurt - once even a 13° incline, but luckily only briefly.\" The Austrian course suggests fire roads and gravel paths rather than technical singletrack. Starting ramp crashes occur when riders clip in, but the main challenge appears to be sustained power rather than bike handling skills. Less technical than The Mid South."
      },
      "elevation": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Dr.hannibal's Garmin recorded 383 meters of elevation gain on the Austrian course, noting \"no wonder it took me longer if I have to ride 100 more meters of elevation than everyone else.\" The 3,500 feet over 65 miles averages 54 feet per mile - rolling terrain that builds fatigue without the leg-breaking ascents of mountain races. Less climbing than The Mid South."

        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Historical weather data shows average highs of 69°F and lows of 55°F, with a 43% chance of rain on any given day. The 2024 Austrian event enjoyed \"sunshine, pleasant temperatures, hardly any wind\" according to dr.hannibal, who noted \"the weather was perfect again this year. With little wind, there are no excuses.\" Lake Constance's mild continental climate typically delivers stable late summer conditions, though severe flooding affected the NC mountain bike series in 2013. Similar climate challenges to SBT GRVL."

      "altitude": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Lake Constance sits at 1,300 feet with climbs into Alpine foothills that won't produce meaningful altitude effects. Dr.hannibal's flat-to-rolling course description from the Austrian event confirms low-altitude cycling throughout. Sea-level fitness works fine here, with mountain scenery masking the minimal elevation impact. Lower altitude than Gravel Worlds — no thin-air concerns."
      },
      "adventure": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Racing through Germany, Switzerland, and Austria in one ride delivers three-country bragging rights with Alpine foothill scenery. The Arkansas ultra-endurance version spans \"the Ozark and Ouachita Mountains and the Arkansas River Valley\" over 1000+ miles with 80,000 feet of climbing. Ted King earned the nickname \"King of the High Country\" finishing in 4 days, 20 hours, 51 minutes."

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "The Austrian time trial draws \"almost 1500 riders\" and is described as \"highly popular, prestigious and always sold out\" with Olympic champion Anna Kiesenhofer setting records. Daniel Hochstraßer called his victory \"the most beautiful victory I have ever had the pleasure to celebrate\" racing in front of friends and family. However, the Lake Constance gravel variant lacks this established reputation."
      },

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "The only Lake Constance gravel event that surfaces is the 109km Gravel Giro, which isn't even the same race. Quality races leave digital footprints; this one leaves question marks about whether it actually happened."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Alexandra Krenmayr, the 47-year-old Queen of the Lake winner, calls it \"such a cool race, I can recommend participation to everyone\" after her fifth participation. The closed roads transform the lakeside route \"into the picturesque dream of every two-wheeled speed junkie\" with turquoise Lake Attersee views throughout the 47.2 kilometers."
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Dr.hannibal describes festival tent dining, expo areas with \"wicked gear,\" and starting intervals creating structured interaction between 10-person teams, 4-person teams, and solo riders. The Austrian event draws riders from 17+ nations with professional timing systems and 15-second starting intervals. Even flooded NC races generate \"thanks to everyone that came out and played around in the mud\" camaraderie."

      "field_depth": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Zero data on who races this thing, which usually means the fast guys are racing somewhere else.

      "value": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Dr.hannibal highlights expo bargain opportunities, quality festival tent food, and nearby Billa grocery convenience for the Austrian event. The NC mountain bike series charged $25 including \"Blimpie sub, chips & drink\" in 2008. Professional timing, closed roads, and three-country scenery deliver solid value for whatever entry fees these regional events charge."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Registration runs €60-100. Lake Constance region pricing reflects Swiss/German tourist costs with major airports requiring Zurich, Munich, or regional Friedrichshafen access. The tri-national location creates attractive riding opportunities but expensive accommodation in one of Europe's pricier regions. Arkansas ultra-endurance competitors spend months preparing gear setups, suggesting significant equipment investment beyond basic entry costs. Higher total cost than Badlands."
