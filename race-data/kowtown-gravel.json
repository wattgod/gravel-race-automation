Course permitting uncertainty until race time is amateur hour."

The Calf at 28 miles and Cow Dog at 16 miles show they understand not everyone needs equal suffering. Good range across commitment levels. Similar distance to Crusher in the Tushar."

Course descriptions emphasize 'punchy climbs' and elevation that will 'keep you honest.' That's sustained climbing work through Colorado high country without being crushing by Rockies standards. Similar elevation profile to Gravel Worlds."

        "explanation": "Historical weather data shows average highs of 75°F and lows of 41°F, with a 47% chance of rain on any given day. June in Kremmling means exposure on those 'sun-baked gravel flats' the organizers warn about, plus afternoon thunderstorm potential at 8,000+ feet elevation. The course runs through 'wide-open ranch country' where weather changes fast and shelter is scarce. No historical weather guidance provided for planning purposes. More weather exposure than Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

        "explanation": "Kremmling sits around 8,000 feet with climbs heading higher into thin-air territory through rolling mountain terrain. That's enough altitude to matter for sea-level riders but not debilitating like some Colorado events. Laura Wisner notes you can 'go for miles and miles and hours and hours' on Boulder County gravel at similar elevations. Similar altitude considerations to Grinduro."

Long climbs and technical descents in high-altitude ranch country provides real adventure, not manufactured difficulty."

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Course distances have shifted each year—Bull went from 90 to 100 to 88 miles across three editions, suggesting ongoing route development. Organizers promise 'aid stations are well stocked, signage is clear, and on-course support has you covered,' but operational consistency remains unproven for a young event still finding its footing."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "You get camping at West Grand High School, a spaghetti dinner, and finish line BBQ with live music — classic grassroots formula. Free showers and bike wash from 1-5 PM post-race shows they're thinking about the basics. But 'rave reviews about routes and community' without a single actual quote or race report suggests the experience is more hype than substance."
      },

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Small-town Colorado trying hard with camping, community expo, and family-friendly BBQ vibes.

Thinner field than Ouray Gravel Grinder."

        "explanation": "Early bird Bull at $130 includes race entry, meal tickets, camping, Friday spaghetti dinner, free showers, and bike wash for 88 miles of Colorado mountain gravel. That's solid value for a weekend camping trip with 10,000 feet of climbing. Standard pricing jumps to $155, which pushes but doesn't break the threshold for the region."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Registration runs $80-100. On-site camping eliminates hotel costs in tourist country where lodging gets expensive fast. Free post-race meals, Friday spaghetti dinner, and bike wash reduce additional spending. Kremmling isn't a destination dining scene, so meal costs stay reasonable beyond what's included. Biggest expense is reaching rural Colorado from population centers. Similar expense level to Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

distance cow and the\nshorter calf for those who are gravel\ncurious\n[Music]\nI've been to a lot of gravel races I've\nnever been to one like this countdown\ngravel is put on by Blaine day and Sean\nScholl who is a Rancher and a coffee\nshop owner Sean you know it looks like a\nnormal Rancher I gotta say not that I\nknow\nthere are a lot of ranchers in Colorado\nthere are a lot of endurance

going to\nshare that with you today\nalso joining us on the ride today are my\nfriends Laura Wisner and Leah vanderlund\nin the mods of gravel Pro who just went\ntop 10 at Unbound gravel\nforeign\ncourses start in the bustling Metropolis\nof downtown kremling and we head out\nacross the Colorado River Gravel Road is\nrunning nice and smooth smoother than\nmany pavement roads so for the shorter\ndistance it's a nice introduction to\ngravel you're not getting into anything\ngnarly\nshort distance takes on some 2000 feet\nof elevation gain the 68 mile cow\ndistance does 4 800 feet of climbing\nalso starts running alongside the\nColorado River and then comes up for a\nloop into the mountains and 85 mile Bowl\ncourse that we're doing today has some 7\n200 feet of climbing takes us up almost\nto ten thousand feet again along the\nColorado River up here past the Shoal\nfamily ranch seeing all their cattle out\nhere this morning David how many take a\ncattle on the ranch\nyep\nsell them off\nthe babies yeah yeah beautiful animals\nthey are\nhi guys so some of these are your cows\nsome of these are somebody else's cows\nhow do you know uh you know mobile I\nknow him by the name by sight the yellow\near tags and the brand yeah\nand they'll come to me because they they\nreally want to be bike riders I grew up\non a five generation cattle ranch we\nstill run it I've always thought people\nwould like to experience this on a bike\nI call it our backyard our training\nground so we we ride up there we run up\nthere we ski up there so we thought why\nnot send the course up there yeah\nwe're standing here on Grouse Mountain\nhaving rented up from the valley headed\nup to the high point followed by a\nrocking descent back down to the valley\nthe scenery is a wide variety of\nColorado greatness you know you're\ngetting\ntoday at least the you know Lush Valley\nlooks like Sound of Music up here with\nall the flowers I wanted to stop and\nfilm here but Tabor says this is a junky\nView and to wait\nfast\nso I guess we'll wait\nwhere are you headed today sir I'm\nheading up to the hills above here to go\npick some morel mushrooms\nI'm trying to conserve energy because I\ngot a long day ahead of me\nthat's why I have a little assistance on\nthe lower end it's a good tool for the\njob yeah lovely place to be oh man look\nat all these flowers\nso you're probably wondering all the\nmarkings on the trees about six to eight\nfeet that's all from Elk this is big\nElka habitat and they winter up here and\nthey eat Aspen trees a bear cub s\nthere's some good ones up here right\nhere\nyeah put your hand down there\nyeah there's a bear cat yeah Cub it's\nprobably the Cubs you saw yeah\nhe was up here the other day and ran\ninto a sound two Cubs\nso there's bears and lions and elk and\nmoose I ran into elk right here riding\nbefore and it's a Wild Kingdom up here\nindeed indeed I haven't seen a car in\nyeah an hour no cars nobody\njust animals\nit's good you're one of them\nthe riding and crumbling is incredible\nyou could go 35 miles a few hours and\nyou might see more ilk than you'll see\npeople it's just miles and miles of\nuntapped and Untamed gravel\nbig shooter is a a local Rancher\nbusinessman and co-promoter of the race\nalong with Blaine day and he's a\ncharacter everybody in town knows him\nand he's a booming voice booming\npersonality and he really wants to bring\npeople in welcome him to kremling and\nwelcome them to our gravel\nso as you turn onto the loot part of the\nlollipop the road gets steeper the road\ngets narrower Road gets chunkier\nso when I was first dating Tabor\nbig shooter would be calling and ask\nWednesday coming to ride my hill\nand that's this hill right up here\ngotta make sure that I'm good enough for\nhis daughter\nit's like six minutes of\nyeah and it just gets steeper and\nsteeper\nyeah you're not one buying it okay see\nthe road that's you'll the race will\ncome on that road you can see so go we\ngo around\nclear around it come on now\ncome back on partial and then head up\nvery few places you can\ntap the local stream for fresh drinking\nwater\n[Applause]\nnot bad Tyler that's the way to do it\nRocky Mountain spring water\nyou me and the bovines this is the spot\nonce you get to the tippity top of\nGrouse Mountain on the long Loop button\nup for a Rowdy ride down if you get\ncotton weather there's a cabin here at\nthe top there may or may not be vodka\nleft in the bottle by the time you get\nto the top but there will certainly be\nshelter should you need it from the\nstorm\nback off do the lollipop let's back onto\nthe beautiful Stick Of The Descent\nit's part of a bike racing team\nand we were called the big Shooters and\nI was typically the biggest guy in the\nPeloton and everyone would like to draft\noff me so that I just got this nickname\nthe big shooter and it's just kind of\nfollowed us and a lot of people don't\neven know my real name they're just like\nyou mean shooter shooter pick shooter\nthen we opened of course big shooter\ncoffee 25 years ago\nand\num yeah and my wife came up with the\nlogo with the coffee cups and this and\nthen yeah so that's how I came up with\nthe name\nafter descending Grouse Mountain the\nlong course pops onto Highway 40 for a\nbrief Traverse on the pavement there's a\nbig wide shoulder and then it rejoins\nthe cow and calf courses for a Rowdy bit\nof two track\nthat section is about five miles the\nfirst few hundred meters are the\nroughest and then it's more sand opens\nup into a wide beautiful Vista\nat the conclusion of the two track it is\nall rolling gravel roads on a big loop\nback towards town the bull horse and the\ncow course do a bigger Loop the calf\ncourse does a shorter Loop the big\ncourse consists of some pretty good\nsized rollers what is left of the front\nof the group after the big Grouse\nMountain climb into scent might be\nbroken up further on these rollers\nthe race is here in High Country in\nColorado so pack a shell we got caught\nin a little bit of rain towards the end\nof the day and there's a chance that you\ncould also get a bit of weather all\nthree courses wrap up in downtown\nKremlin where there'll be a party after\nthe Finish City square is just a block\nfrom Big Shooters if you want to get\nyourself a coffee or an ice cream or my\npersonal favorite the electric fence go\ncheck it out\nI've done a lot of riding around here\nand crumbling uh crumbling also up into\nSteamboat and as they're known for their\nchampagne gravel there's nothing nothing\ndifferent around here it is champagne\nit's smooth and then certainly a couple\nchunky sections just for to keep it\ninteresting and keep it fun\nhow many cars have we see today I think\nwe saw maybe maybe 10.\nmaybe 10 and we were out there for six\nhours it's a it's a gravel paradise and\nuh if you like to ride in the mountains\nif you like a little bit of dirt this

          "transcript": "So over on that hill over there, there's\na tiny little cabin which is where I\nproposed to Taber. I I proposed. She\nsays yes. Great moment. Have all that.\nWe walk back and there's an outhouse up\nthere without a door. And he just leans\nout of the front sitting on the toilet.\nI knew it.\nAnd then I proceeded to do their\nengagement photo shortly. Yes.\n[Music]\nGravel races are a dime a dozen. So why\ncome to Cowtown Gravel? Well, two\nreasons. The people and the place. The\nspectacular Grand County way up high\nhere in Colorado. And yes, the people\nbehind Cowtown Gravel do have a couple\nhundred head of cattle on their ranch,\nwhich the course runs right through.\nCome along for the ride as we check out\nthe courses of Cow Town Gravel 2025.\nCowtown Gravel is put on by Blaine Day,\nwho is now retired and enjoys ride his\nbike up here in Kremling, and the Schaw\nfamily, who are unique in that they are\nboth endurance athletes and\nmulti-generational Colorado ranchers.\nI'm fourth generation and my kids are\nfifth generation. Why put on a bike\nrace? It seems like you're plenty busy\nrunning a ranch, running a coffee shop.\nWe have some really good terrain around\nhere and I've always put on races,\nrunning races, Nordic ski races, rowing\nraces, and the next phase is I guess was\ngravel races, you know, cuz it's like we\nhave a lot of good gravel and and I like\nto to share. Today we're out here riding\nwith the Shaw family, Sean Schaw aka Big\nShooter, and his children and elite\nrunners Tyler and Taber. Taber is a\nprofessional trail runner as is her\nhusband\nEli. Eli Hming last year won the\nUTMBB Ultra Trail Mount Blanc\neffectively the World Championships of\ntrail running. The Scholes also run the\nbest coffee shop ice cream spot in town.\nBig\nshooters. Who knows? You know, my\ngrandpa might roll over in his grave if\nhe knew like if I sending 500 people\nthrough the ranch be like, \"What are you\ndoing?\" Uh, but what do your ranching\nbuddies think of of you inviting a bunch\nof weirdos and stretchy pants to descend\non the quiet very beautiful area? Being\na rancher helps because, you know, I'm\nnot like a hobby rancher. We have close\nto 200 head of cattle. So, I'm I'm\nlooked at as a legitimate rancher that\nhas a problem with aerobic exercise.\nSure. Yeah. I so you know that all\nprobably stem\nfrom a cardiac rehab background where I\nworked with cardiac patients. So I I\nreally try to pro promote movement and\nhowever that looks um for people. I\nthink we're meant to move and this is\njust another avenue to express that.\nYeah. How about how we are meant to\nmove? Like\none fun thing to discuss, argue about,\ncelebrate is that how hard gravel racing\ncan be. You've got three different\ncourses. You've got the calf, you've got\nthe cow, you've got the bull. The bull\nthis year is 100 miles, 10,000 ft of\nclimbing. Yeah. All at elevation. How\nhard is two What's What's the right\namount of hard for you as a rider? And\nwhat's the right amount of hard for you\nas a promoter when you're inviting a\nbunch of different people to your ranch\nand the area around? I think you run the\nrisk of of\nuh getting a reputation of putting on\ntoo hard of things. I used to put on a\nski race that was like 80k up on\nRabbiters's Pass and it was just hard.\nBut I think it's it's something for\neveryone. And I think\nit Yeah, it it's it when you combine\naltitude with elevation, it it is going\nto be hard. But I think people out\nthere, they like to do things hard. They\ndon't necessarily like to get to be\nscared. So, we've tweaked the courses\nthis year. They are still challenged,\nbut I think they're less they're less\nuh, you know, scary in terms of\ndescents. What I like about all gravel\nracing in general, yours in particular,\nis you can get in where you fit in. You\ncan scale the challenge to what's\nappropriate to you in terms of like time\nyou've got to train or what just feels\nright at the time. So, you can start off\nwith the shorter one or you can go for\nthe bigger one or you can hit the goals\nright in between and you still get all\nof this. Yeah. And we're we're really\nwilling to accommodate those people that\nmaybe thought they were ready for that\nand they I'm like, \"Hey, please, we\nencourage you to scale down if you\ndon't, you know, everyone has ambitions\nand then it comes race day and they're\nlike, I haven't been riding. Maybe I\nshould do the cow or the calf.\" But I'm\nnot, you know,\nthere's the bull is challenging, but we\ncertainly have a population of racers\nthat are more than capable of handling\nthat. Oh, for sure. I mean last year\nAlex House took the win there for sure\nguy that uh you know races like tour to\nFrance etc and is now making his\nprofession as a as a gravel racer and\nyou and Alex House's father raced\ntogether once. Yeah, we were on time.\nYeah, we were on a team called Big\nShooters back in the 90s and it's like\nwe all had kids and now their kids are\nracing and uh it's kind of come full\ncircle which is kind of cool cuz his\ndad's coming back and another I might\nhave three old teammates that you know\nwe reconnect we reconnect through gravel\nand uh to me I it's every level like\nflat pedals\nto carbon bikes and power meters and so\nwe we we really encourage people to if\nif they just want to try it. You know,\nwe have a distance that's a good\nbeginner distance. We'll have plenty of\naid stations and uh yeah, so it should\nbe should be a fabulous party in the\npark. We got like four bands. Wow. Cool.\nUm and we're actually have homegrown uh\nbeef and veggie burgers, but uh it's\nit's locally sourced uh meat, so people\nreally like that.\nI think three things to make a good\nevent is you got first and foremost you\nhave to have good courses. Sure. You\ncan't screw up the timing cuz that's why\npeople race. They want quantification to\ncompare. And then you got to have a good\nparty. Like people don't want like more\nsugar necessarily. They want like\nsomething wholesome, savory at the end.\nAnd I think if you do those three three\nthings right, you're going to have a\nsuccessful event. Mhm. We have fabulous\nfireworks on Friday night off the\ncliffs. If you've never seen those in\nKremling, they're they're so if people\ncome early at the kind of tided that's\npeople like, \"Why did you do it on the\nfourth?\" Well, we we didn't want to jump\non another rac's date. Sure. Cuz\nthere's, you know, there's Play well\nwith your neighbors. Play well with the\nneighbors cuz you like going doing other\npeople's events, right? Exactly. Yeah.\nWe'll have a dinner the night before at\nthe high school where you and we'll have\nshowers available for free after the\nrace. free parking, free camping. Uh\nwe're just trying to be accommodating\nbecause obviously Kremling can't house a\nlot of people. So, a little bit later\nstart time just to allow some people\nthat are going to drive in the day of\nthe race. Eli, Taber, and Tyler all\ntrain up here in the high elevation of\nthe mountains and put in a fair amount\nof hours here on the ranch. You know,\nthere's nothing quite like it. It's\ndefinitely a hidden gem in Colorado. Um,\nthe dirt roads are endless and obviously\nthe the views are pretty dang good. Uh,\nwe have uh some of the best dirt roads I\nthink you can find in Colorado.\nTell us about the traffic. How many cars\nhave we seen today? Uh, today so far I\nthink we've\nseen Oh, we did see one. Actually, I was\ngoing to go for the zero, but we did see\none. We saw one car. The show family, as\nyou might have gathered, is a\ncompetitive bunch both on the\ninternational running competitive stage\nand just within the family themselves.\nYeah, this is like carcass alley. You'll\nride this and there's always pieces of a\ndeer.\nYou always want to bring someone slower\nwith you on a run. So, my parents\ndriveway is like 400 m down. And as\nkids, they used to kick us out at the\nbottom and say, \"Run home.\" Didn't\nmatter the weather, didn't matter the\nday. We'd like be like, \"It's snowing.\"\nAnd my mom would pull out a jacket, be\nlike, \"Here you go.\" We'd be like, \"It's\ndark.\" And they're like, \"We'll drive\nbehind you with the headlights on.\" So\nthat kind of upbringing either grew up\nto be very bitter or a professional\nrunner. And it turns out there you go.\nThey were really rolling the dice. Like\nyou can love it or you can hate it. And\nthen we did the presidential fitness\ntest and I was like, I won the 800. I\nthink I'm good at this.\nWhere are we sir? And what what is this\nlocation? What is the historical marker\nstate here? You know, I had to up one\nTaber and Eli. So, I decided to get\nmarried about a mile higher in that hay\nmeadow right there. I made the\nimpossible possible. Right, Taber?\nI'm not going to talk about it. She's\nstill salty. It's cuz she doesn't know\nhow to drive a stick. Well, no outhouse\nin this field for a sibling to ambush\nsomeone. That is true. That is true. And\nthen there's the cabin where they\nproposed to oneup me again. And you can\nI'm sensing a theme with this family.\nYou can even see the little outhouse\nright there. You can see the outhouse on\nthe right. The best the best dump you'll\never take.\nWhat was it like growing up out here in\nKremlin, Colorado? Yeah, it was really\ndifferent just because the place that we\ngrew up wasn't like very athletically\nmotivated and so we had to learn like as\nkids to like live in the balance of like\nthe ranch style and then I like to call\nit the lycra wearing style and kind of\nalways knowing that we were different\nbut different was fun and that means\nthat we got to like I don't know see\neverything in a different light because\nyou saw it in how you were\nagriculturally seeing it and then how\nyou were recreating. Yeah. So, usually\nit's like get up in the morning early,\ndo your chores, make sure like\neverything on the ranch at the first\nthing in the morning is kind of ticked\noff and then we go and do our training\nand then we come back and if there's any\nother projects that need done, you do\nthose and then if you have the\nmotivation, you go and train again. And\nso sometimes, yeah, training's really\ntired and that's okay.\nGive me an example of a ranch chore you\nneed to check off. Yesterday Tyler, your\nbrother was, you know, pulling a calf\nout of a creek. Y and you had to rebuild\nthe chainsaw to cut some branch. So I\nknow there like there's not a set\nregimen. It's not like working in say\nshooters coffee shop, but what's what's\nan example of a\nSoanch is like fixing fence. So you know\nthat this is your nicest time of year\nfor the mosquitoes come out. So, you're\ngonna go get your wire and your fence\npost driver and you're gonna go make\nsure that none of the snow put any of\nthe fences down. And so, yeah, it's a\nlot of upper body strength. You can tell\nby my massive muscles.\nLook at those guns. They're pretty big.\nUh, yeah, that or right now it's\nirrigating, so we're trying to get all\nof our meadows green, so it's chipping\nditches, making sure water's going where\nit's supposed to go. But, it's an ever\nevolving chore, so no point of the\nseason looks the same, which kind of\nmakes it fun.\n[Laughter]\nShooter, tell us about the aid stations\nwe have here in Cow Town. I think we're\nat 9,300 ft. Yeah. So, it's good place,\ngood scenic place for a aid station\nafter after the little climb we made you\ngo through. So, we've got aid station at\nthe top of Grouse, the big climb on the\nlong. Yeah, for the long course, the\nbull course, they'll be it's and that's\nat 10,000. And then the aid station here\nwill will uh be for the 68 and the the\ncow and the bull course. Kind of a local\nflare. We have some characters that'll\nbe up here\nthat like uh it's kind of like the\ncowboy aid station. They all have a\nlittle bit of an\nagricultural\nupbringing which is cool because you\nknow it's it's a whole another vibe for\nthem. They can't fathom that people\nwould actually ride a\nbicycle 1,800 feet to get here. So, it's\nkind of it's it's kind of it's kind of I\nthink it's neat because we're um we're\ninvolving the whole community in this\nevent, people that have nothing to do\nwith cycling. So, I think it's I think\nthat's that that helps everyone maybe\nunderstand everybody else a little\nbetter. Agreed. And conversely, for a\nlot of gravel races, I don't know the\nexact breakdown of your registration\nlist, but many of us are coming from\ncities and towns where we're not\ninteracting with wrenchers on a\nday-to-day basis, at least beyond just\nlike passing each other on the road. So,\nstopping and and enjoying a Snickers bar\ntogether. So, yeah. And they like it\nbecause they actually get to visit with\nthese folks. And there's, you know,\nwe'll have people from all over the\ncountry here. And I think our median age\nfor this race last year we had almost\n670 670 folks and the average age was\nprobably 52 53. So it's an older\ndemographic for sure. We had you know\nit's it's going to be a challenge\ncertainly for anyone coming from sea\nlevel. But just slow down, take in the\nview and enjoy the aid station. Plenty\nof views to take in.\nLee, you've raced your bike all over the\nworld. What's it like riding bikes up\nhere in Grand County? I have and it is\namazing. Uh the vistas, the mountains,\nthe prairies, the plains, the cows, you\ngot it all here. All the things. What's\nthe What's the choice of rubber? You're\non the LA, you got plenty of clearance.\nWhat would you recommend folks put on\nfor cow town? Yeah, I would say run at\nleast a 45 is what I would recommend. If\nyou can go bigger, even better. Uh there\nare some steep climbs and a little loose\nin sections, but for the most part, 45\nand above, good to go. The surface\naround here in Kremling that we've been\nriding, it goes from champagne gravel to\na little bit of off-road MMR feel, a\nlittle bit of a lowmaintenance road. Uh\nshooter actually just carved this road\nout on the course and got the tiller\nout, got the cows going. So that's got\nsome nice fresh dirt. Uh there's also a\nlittle bit of some chunkier\nuh just loose rock, but for the most\npart, you're going to encounter pretty\nmuch everything on this course from\npavement to cow fields. As a guy who\nlives here, what's what's the bike of\nchoice? What's the tire of choice? Well,\nI'm riding a 2.1 Mscow cuz um I want to\nbe like Alex House when I grow up. You\nknow, the trend is to go a little bit\nbigger, a little less air\npressure certainly.\nUm, you could ride it on 40s,\nbut I would go a little wider. Tell us\nabout the courses if you would one by\none. So, the we'll start with the calf.\nThere's the calf, the cow, and the bull.\nWhat is the calf course? So, the calf\ncourse this year we modified it. We\nshortened it a little, added a little\nbit more gravel um without the big hard\ngnarly climbs. Uh I think it has a\naround\n2300 ft of climbing. Then the cow\nhas 68 miles and it and we give you this\nclimb that goes up through the the the\nranch which is only open one time a year\nfor this event. And then of course the\nbull we add in another uh 2500t climb up\nGrouse Mountain before doing the the\nlast climb up through the ranch. So it\nhas\napproximately 10,000 vert over almost\nmiles. Big thanks to the Grand County\nTourism Board for helping put on this\nfine event. Visit Grand County is the\nwebsite and a good slogan. I encourage\nyou to come visit Grand County in July\n5th. the date of cow town gravel this\nyear is a fine time to do so. I'll put\nlinks to all the information you need in\nthe video description down below. Hope\nthat you can make up for the race. If\nyou're in a part of the world where that\njust isn't in the cards, I hope that\nwatching the riding here has inspired\nyou to get out wherever you are and\nenjoy the ride.",

route look at\nthat right out of town right into it\nthank\nyou boy nothing else it is a Scenic\nstart I've been trying\nto nurse it a little\nhere if I remember right uh kremling is\nlike 7,000 something elevation\nso and there's\n5,000 over 5,000 ft of climbing today I\ncan't remember how high we go but it's\nhigh and I have learned not to push it\nat\nelevation for me that's a death sentence\non the day\nso hey\nguys so we've actually been in Colorado\nfor a few days\ntoday is like the 6th of July or\nso came out had the fourth off so came\nout west and been camping for a few days\na little bit of\nfishing have some family with us so\nwe've been doing some\nhiking\nwoo come for Cal toown\ngravel stay for this man\nman beautiful day in\nColorado really nice area of the state\nreally a little crowded over the 4th of\nJuly as you might expect\nbut weather is gorgeous can't get any\nbetter so it's been a fun few days\nmorning morning how you doing not too\nbad about yourself good\nmorning fellas how are\nyou some guys from No Coast gravel\nSyndicate there great YouTube channel if\nyou do not watch I would highly\nrecommend I'll link their Channel below\nit's some good folks spent a lot of time\non a single speed at times too so\nso we had a bit of an interesting day\nyesterday Carm traveling with for once\nit wasn't the van breaking\ndown alternator went out\nyesterday we are in downtown Breen Ridge\non the 5th of\nJuly which you might\nguess was a pretty\ncrazy\nso did some\nscrambling involved a lift ride\ngetting the van getting parts from an\nAuto\nZone back to\nbra getting the\nHonda taking it back to the\ncampsite and replacing a alternator so\nyesterday evening I was wrenching on a\nvehicle watching\nYouTube trying to figure out what we\nwere\ndoing I am happy to say we were\nsuccessful somehow may be a little bit\nsurprising but we got her done\nso it's a good Testament to you know\nwork it through adversity and coming out\nthe other\nside I will say I feel like dog\ntoday\nbut what's new that's not surprise\nso this is a\nproblem oh\nboy what do I do\nhere oh\nboy I'm in trouble\nall right so what we're seeing\nhere I can see\ndaylight oh\nwell this is going to be an\nadventure\nI don't know how you even address that I\ndon't think there is a I put it down so\nthat I can at least make it back I think\nbut like literally I noticed my seat\nangle is wrong and I got off and it I\nthought it was just a bracket oh that\ndoesn't look good yeah that is not ideal\noh no those downhills honestly I don't\nknow I just noticed my seat angle was\nwrong and I assumed the bracket came\nloose and I was like oh yeah it's Wiggly\nand then I I was like oh it's not\nwiggling up here so I just put it down\nI'm going to try and make it back I put\nit down just going back that way yeah\nended the road for back of the pat\nground it is today's adventure has\nturned into how can I get back to town\nnow which wave goodbye to\nRich oh boy that sucks well Rich know\nit's a bad time smile Joseph turn around\nall right\nthanks oh boy I'll leave it at the\nbeautiful place to break\ntop\nyeah oh boy I really did her this\ntime I cracked my seat tube almost the\nentire way\noff\nso I kind of pounded it down a couple\ninches below where it needs to be but\nI'm not riding 50\nmiles more like\nthat it'll be interesting enough making\nit back like this so I'm turning around\nand this adventure is taking on a\nnew a new aspect try and get back to\ntown with a broken seat post so when I\nhave it down it feels pretty good but I\nhave a\ncrack on this side I could see in in the\nseat post and it was if I would have\nwiggled it a little bit more it would\nhave broken clear off I don't know if it\nwas a great idea to P that down cuz I\nmay not get it back out but I need to\nget back to town\nsomehow I'm going to do my best to do\nthat on the bicycle so you know this is\nwhere it'd be good to know how your GPS\nWorks a little better so you can\nlike route\nback like uh I want to go exactly the\npath I just took I think I don't really\nknow how to do that maybe I can just\nfollow my own\nbreadcrumb guys this is where I'm at\nthere's\nnothing still nothing\nokay that doesn't look too bad I don't\nsee any freaking roads on this thing but\nI need to get it back to Kremlin when\nI'm up\nthere son of a\nnutcracker\nwell let's see how I figure this out\nit's one way on\nthe okay status\nupdate that wasn't far enough down and\nit was still moving on me so\nI ped it down another inch or\nso so we'll see we have joined back with\nI think there's a short route calf it's\nlike 30 some so the good news is I\nshould have people I could kind of long\nas I'm seeing bikes I think I'm going\nthe right way what a beautiful day what\na beautiful day this this good good fit\nwell it's kind of fun seeing all the\nRiders you guys okay yeah Kodak moment\nah it is a Kodak moment you're\nright it is not great riding a seat 4\nInes\nlow what is a meat challenge\nman this course\nis the first 10 miles of this course\nreally unmatched unrivaled for scenery\nthis is just beautiful\nlandscape I got plenty of time to enjoy\nit now I'm committed to\nnot being negative about this experience\nand I'm going to be out I'm going to\nenjoy myself Cruise back to town eat\nsome pretzels the adventure is taking a\ndifferent form but it's still a fun day\na beautiful\nday in a beautiful\nplace nice work nice work\nwell it's going all right the good news\nis I ran into a carbon repair guy what\nare the odds of that anyway he stopped\nas I was looking at my wounds and I\nactually had to pound it down further it\nwasn't stable enough as it was\nand he said and it's his profession inch\nand a half you get inch and a half two\ninches you should be safe fish\nso cast don't worry we're good I got I\ngot this thing in there as safe as can\nbe we're we're getting down there now\nthough like I look like a\nclown riding this thing with the so a\nlot of standing up one positive can bomb\nthe downhills it's like having a a\ndropper unintended\ndropper so the downhills are fun but\nflat kind of\nsucks the uphills I can make to\nbut not like 60 more miles\nto it's such a beautiful day and this is\nsuch a beautiful landscape that\nI'm man I'm having\nfun enjoying\nmyself that's what I'm here for so I\nguess it's a success in the end I am\nbummed to not see the rest of the course\ngiven how pretty it is I didn't even go\nup the big climb up into the trees and\nstuff so that would have been pretty\nsweet but what we going to do you know\nI'm an idiot we all know that right I'm\nsure this was my fault I don't know what\nI did but it's broken make the best of\nit still have\nfun there are some animals up there in\nthat Valley and I can't tell there's no\nfence here and we're not open range so\nI'm guessing those\nare wild beasts elk\nmaybe I think we're looking at some wild\nBeast\nfolks might be\nshrubs\nshrubs yeah I think they're\nshrubs than false alarm false alarm\neverybody those are just\nshrubs I will say one thing\nI'm getting my sherff standing while\nclimbing because this doesn't cut it\nwe are back in town that is the view\nfrom\ntown back side of\ntown I think the Finish is different\nfrom the start so I'm going try and run\ndown there let them know I was\nscratching so they're not waiting for me\nI made it back to the Finish but not the\nway I wanted but rode back it's like a\npretty good old\nFestival there's a dude in the truck I\ndon't know where he's going\nanyway looks like quite an enjoyable\nAfterparty situation\nhere I'm going to go back to the car get\nchanged\nyeah better a bummer but that's okay I\nstill had a good time out there I will\ncertainly come back and give Cal Town\ngravel another try hopefully with a\nfunctional seat post next\nyear appreciate you joining us this\nepisode sorry you didn't get to see more\nof the Cal toown course uh no Coast\ngravel Syndicate is out there riding so\nhe may give his episode of you and uh\nsee everything I missed out there if you\nhaven't done so already be awesome if\nyou could subscribe to the channel like\nand comment below and we'll see you next\ntime this is\nworking okay that's where we're working\nwith yeah there's your\nproblem been

but\nlet's rewind this puppy and start and\nstart\n[Music]\nit's a high Colorado Rockies test today\nwe're up here in Kremlin Colorado\nelevation 3400 ft testing a revel Rover\nfrom Carbondale Colorado on the course\nof Cowtown gravel which has some 9,000\nft of climbing on tap over about 90 Mi\nput on a big rubber this is a pretty\ncomfortable bike as is but since I'm\nstill suffering a bit from PTSD from\nstage five of Oregon Trail last week I\nput on some 47 Pathfinder Pros on these\nReserve 40 44s which plump them up to\nnearly 50 to keep me on track I'm\ntesting new garbon Edge 1050 this\nMammoth tablet size computer come along\nfor the ride we'll see how we go\n[Applause]\nthese double digit grades can use a\nlittle more gear 42 ring and the\n1044 not quite\nenough for the weight of my carcass and\nthe output of the engine it's pretty\nthough is that audio yeah all my name is\nPaul\nThomas that's Ben\nDelaney owner of this\ncamera Ben You' done a lot of gravel\nraces I don't know about you but this is\none of the better courses I've done oh\nthis is gorgeous\nhere spectacular zero\ncars well we always talk about the Spear\nof\ngravel to me it's riding with a buddy\nnot racing\nthem sure he'll dropped me at some point\nbut how far we in Ben we\nare we're 35 up\n2016 okay\n26 miles that's all that's all feels\nlike more\nright I think I'm calling it a career if\nyou want to call this a\ncareer I think our average pace is two\nand a half miles\nhour it's starting to get dark what's\nour\nelevation we\nare 9200 ft\nokay here's one of the more spectacular\nviews C the angel singing we're in where\nis this cremling we\nstarted Kremlin Colorado Kremlin Kremlin\nlike the Kremlin almost downtown Cow\nTown\nwell got to\nsay when you're not really racing it's\neasier to enjoy these views\ntalking about I'm racing my heart out\nhere put you in the hold your line just\nto prove my point first say when you're\nbetter than or you want to beend you're\nbetter hold your\nline tell me about your\nRevel reel reel dress is a\nmess no\nthat's is that a boulder brand it's\nCarbondale brand okay\nwhat's the heart\nrate I'm a soul Rider\npo I haven't used the heart rate one\nsometime I just want I use one just cuz\nI'm starting to go into a fiber heart\nattack do you want a\nPayday sure\nMommy I want my\nmommy I love you you did this to\nyourself there's our leader it's a man\nhimself he built this particular type of\ntorture we'll follow him\ndown thanks\nguyscome I'm going to see if I can\nfollow a shooter here it's probably too\nlate to do so but we'll\ntry oops\ndon't take that\nline thanks you know I know you ride\nabout this a\nlot better that than the body part\nyeah\ncyy racing and people\nthis is a rough day for the\ncamera trying to use\nthe camera mount in my mouth you saw how\nwell that worked\noh dear oh\ndear the second edition of Cow Town\ngravel was a barn burner there are three\ndistances on top the bull which I was\nfoolish enough to do the cow the middle\ndistance and then for sensible people\nthe\ncalf I was just quite pleased with this\nRevel Rover despite it being covered in\ndirt in my slobber it's got a beautiful\npaint job the looks to me like an Irish\nRover with the the green on here it's\nsurprisingly comfortable looking at the\nthe fork it looks like it would be as\nchunky as some of the dirt roads out\nhere but it's there's got a a bit of\nflex to it and the\n715 uh head angle makes for a a calm\nride similarly on the back end there's a\nbit of nice Flex to the post which I\nappreciate I think that's Primo gravel\nsuspension is a carbon post with a bit\nof flex saddle is not my favorite SG I\nguess\nmy rear end is larger than this is made\nfor but it's it's a fine saddle and yes\nthere are huge tires on here but I rode\nthis bike around my home and Boulder for\na bit with the stock 40 Ramblers and was\nagain pleasantly surprised by how plush\nit was a couple little knits to pick\nsome gripes the chain\nand chainstay formed a thrash metal band\non a few of the descents just just\ntrying to beat the snot out of each\nother and I think some of that is\nbecause the chain stay is dropped so\ndramatically normally you when you get\nchain slap it's the top of the chain\nhitting the top of the chain stay and\nhere I think the especially when I was\ndown in the tin or the you know some of\nthe smaller cogs the chain from\nunderneath was slacking up\nthere other than that no no issues as I\nwas griping about uh on some of the\nclimbs I could have used a little bit\nmore rope on the low end you know this\nis the Explorer 12 speed which is 10 to\n44 and it's got a 42 Toth and it seems\nlike I don't know the math I should do\nthe math here but when the you know\nclimbs are over into the double digits I\nthink having a gear that matches that\nlike if it's 10% it should be at least\n1: one if it's 11% it should\nbe what is that 1.1 to1 but I could use\nmore rope on the backing is what I'm\nwhat I'm trying to\nsay the tires were fantastic probably\ncould have used a little bit more grip\nto counteract my lack of skills as I\nshowed by putting myself into a tree but\ngenerally I think your Traction in\ngravel is just rubber on the dirt like\nthere's no magic tread pattern per se I\nmean yes if it's a little bit muddy and\nyou're trying to climb up something\nsteep having you know big bitey knobs\nhelp but\nmostly it's just purchase on the ground\nI was it\n24 in the front 25 in the back probably\ncould have gone lower they started off\nhard often at these events there's\neither an official neutral or just a\nkind of ease into it and race\nco-director Blain day let us out on his\n4 by and within I don't know a couple\nminutes of leaving West Grand High\nSchool which is where we started it was\nfull gas you know I'm doing like 500 600\nwatts just trying to stay on the\nwheel I foolishly tried to stay with the\nlikes of Alex house for a few minutes\nand\nthen reality put me in my place and then\nthe race was blown apart at some points\nit kind of felt like Leadville where\nwe'd just be climbing into this\nStratosphere and people would be like\ntwo bikes apart two bike links apart and\nthere's no way you could possibly close\nit but such a beautiful country hardly\nany vehicles\nit's a long road up\nhere you know the cow to vehicle ratio\nis you know at least 1,000 to one whose\ntown is it Cow Town whose Town Cow\nTown got to consult the notes here for\nthe prices three bike models\neverything's on sale now in the bike\nindustry seemingly so the force model\nthe top end model which normally goes\nfor 7K is on sale for 4250 this rival\nmodel which is 5500 is on sale for 4,100\nbucks and then there's also a 12-speed\ngrx model for 4,600 on sale for 3500 and\nthen you can get the frame set for 1,800\nbucks pretty good price speaking of\nprices these\nwheels the reserve 40 44\ngravel 1,800 bucks uh they've got a 27\nmil internal like fatter than my thumb\nuh super wide and that's what plumped\nthese 47 tires up to 49 the end of the\nday we had some pretty demoralizing\nwinds um but it's a good test of the the\naerodynamics and the stability of the\nwheel more so the stability really uh\nstrong Crosswinds the 40 is about as\ndeep as I'd recommend for most folks on\nthe front end of a gravel bike just\nbecause you've got less traction on the\nground and with these super fast\nsnubnosed uh profile it didn't feel like\nI was getting slapped around at all back\ncuz you're sitting on the thing it's\nmuch more stable you know a 45 or a 50\nor in this case a 44 I think it's\nperfectly stable how much does a fat\ntire affect the aerodynamics of the\nwheel I don't know but these are\ncertainly\ndesigned for gravel tires for 30 to to\n50 mil and they look cool the most\nimportant part right so the the cush of\nthe ride Revel got out front early with\nthermoplastic carbon wheels uh CSS is an\noutfit in Utah its house brand is Forge\nand bond in contrast to the typical\nTheros set Carbon wheels thermoplastic\nWheels feel to me just a touch more\nforgiving this Frame set is not that\ndesign but it has that same feel and\nthen that I guess I would have to\nattribute to the engineers building in\njust a bit of flex and the\nfork got udh built into the back end so\nif and when tram rolls out that 13-speed\nExplorer group that we saw back at\nUnbound the Revel Rover is ready I would\nlike to see just some little carbon\nStoppers and some of the the empty holes\nthat's a tiny cosmetic thing but\nsomething that I think would just round\nout the package\nnicely at the end of the day over big\nshoo 's coffee there is a impromptu race\ndirector Gathering of source we saw Mr\nKemo Mr lifetime Grand Prix and then\nMike bromba who runs Big Horn gravel I\nwas riding with him for a little bit of\nthe day until he and the day got away\nfrom me and then big shooter himself\nthat's one thing I appreciate about the\ngravel Community is that a lot of these\nfolks who put on Races like to play\nthemselves and while many of us like\nmyself like to complain about things and\nlike this race sucks and that race\nshould be this way a lot of folks just\nget out there and build it them El so\nthe rest of us can enjoy so thanks for\nthat\nfolks so as I\nmentioned I ended up making sweet love\nto a tree at the top of the course I was\nsitting there at the Aid Station fooling\naround with my GoPro which was not\ncooperating big shooter the race\ncodirector came by I was like oh I'm\ngoing to film big shooter going down\nhere so I tried to catch up to him\nchasing down the mountain side hit a\nlittle puddle\nand full-on yard sale and\nyou know bottles going phone\ngoing I smashed up my\nK uh computer Mount which has the handy\nlittle twist\noff mount on the bottom so while this is\nno more luckily many of the new Garmin\ncomputer mounts have the same quarter\nturn attachment on the bottom so you can\nuse this kwim piece which I dig which is\nyou know quarter turn for putting on the\nGarment I like that quite a bit I've\nbeen using the DJI which has a magnetic\nattachment so same deal you can have it\non the front of the bike or on a chesty\nand then quickly pop it off to do some\nthis so you know as always priority\nnumber one is like don't crash\nyourself a rule I obviously did not\nfollow today and then two is like when\nit's safe yeah get some varied footage\nwhat do\nthanks for last\nnight Mike Mike is just walking up\nputting cash under a what is this for\nthe milkshake yeah I can't buy you a\nmilkshake thanks for asking what I do\nlast night this is a a whole story yeah\nthat was a I gave you the the soft touch\nyeah yeah yeah good to see you nice ride\nout there see you Mike rumo everybody\ntried to buy the guy a milkshake and\nhe's so generous he won't even let me do\nI think that's all I have to say about\nthat it's not loading to straa how can I\nhave emotional satisfaction without it\nloading to Strava so I was hoping to\ntest the new garment Edge 1050 today and\nI did in a way early on I was able to\nappreciate the clim pro\nfeatures of you know seeing the\ncolorcoded gradient of upcoming climbs\nand where where you were also I like\nbeing able to see where you're going\npretty simple thing right just like is\nthis going to be a really sharp turn or\nis it a more wide open turn and having\nthat and the elevation at the bottom at\nthe same time is a nice thing and a\nbenefit for having a ginormous screen\nand I was just testing the coros dura\nlast week and garin's been at this for a\nwhile they're ginormous international\ncompany and turns out they're better at\nit than upstart so it's also not a cheap\nunit\none thing I appreciated for the latter\n2third of the course after I smashed off\nthe mount and had this in my pocket was\nit was still giving me little warnings\nlittle piano\nplink which is an indication of steep\nturn approaching so that's what the\nscreen says but you just get a little\nyou know audio feedback of that so I had\nthat in my pocket which was nice going\ndownhills just knowing to to break a bit\nmore battery life\nis I don't know 80% or so after being\ngone all day nice crisp screen more\nfeatures than I know what to do with uh\nbut the combination of seeing the\ndirections and seeing you know\ncolorcoded uh clim profile that I think\nis pretty ideal for for gravel events\nbecause those are that's pertinent\ninformation it was nice to meet many of\nyou out here in Kremlin Colorado look\nforward to seeing you guys at the next\none in the meantime thanks for watching\nthanks for subscribing and whatever size\ntires you choose to run just enjoy the\nride okay this is going to be the best\nthing all day I believe you 100% better\nthan the better than said thank you\nma'am thank\nyou like",
