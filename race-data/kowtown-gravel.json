Course permitting uncertainty until race time is amateur hour."

The Calf at 28 miles and Cow Dog at 16 miles show they understand not everyone needs equal suffering. Good range across commitment levels."

Laura Wisner notes the roads 'are so smooth around here' but warns when it 'got a little chunky, well, I hope your bike handling's up to the challenge.'"

        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "The Bull climbs 10,000 feet over 88 miles through rolling mountain terrain, while the Cow delivers 5,500 feet over 54 miles. Course descriptions emphasize 'punchy climbs' and elevation that will 'keep you honest.' That's sustained climbing work through Colorado high country without being crushing by Rockies standards."
      },
      "climate": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "June in Kremmling means exposure on those 'sun-baked gravel flats' the organizers warn about, plus afternoon thunderstorm potential at 8,000+ feet elevation. The course runs through 'wide-open ranch country' where weather changes fast and shelter is scarce. No historical weather guidance provided for planning purposes."
      },
      "altitude": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Kremmling sits around 8,000 feet with climbs heading higher into thin-air territory through rolling mountain terrain. That's enough altitude to matter for sea-level riders but not debilitating like some Colorado events. Laura Wisner notes you can 'go for miles and miles and hours and hours' on Boulder County gravel at similar elevations."
      },
      "adventure": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Remote ranchlands, rolling mountains, and 85% gravel through BLM territory delivers legitimate Colorado backcountry experience. The 'untapped and untamed' marketing actually matches the terrain description for once. Long climbs and technical descents in high-altitude ranch country provides real adventure, not manufactured difficulty."
      },
      "prestige": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Now in its fourth year with $5,000 in prize money split between top five men and women on the Bull course. Limited to 750 riders and serves as a fundraiser for the community gym floor in Kremmling. Still very much a grassroots Colorado event without documented pro field or major gravel scene recognition."
      },
      "race_quality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Course distances have shifted each year—Bull went from 90 to 100 to 88 miles across three editions, suggesting ongoing route development. Organizers promise 'aid stations are well stocked, signage is clear, and on-course support has you covered,' but operational consistency remains unproven for a young event still finding its footing."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "You get camping at West Grand High School, a spaghetti dinner, and finish line BBQ with live music — classic grassroots formula. Free showers and bike wash from 1-5 PM post-race shows they're thinking about the basics. But 'rave reviews about routes and community' without a single actual quote or race report suggests the experience is more hype than substance."
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Small-town Colorado trying hard with camping, community expo, and family-friendly BBQ vibes. The fact that they moved the finish from West Grand High School to Kremmling Town Square shows they're engaging the actual town. But this is year four and still feels like a local church fundraiser with bikes."
      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Prize money goes to top five overall men and women on the Bull course, but no past winner names or competitive results surface in available race reports. The 750-rider cap suggests decent participation, but this remains a weekend warrior and bucket-list event without documented competitive depth or notable gravel scene participants."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Early bird Bull at $130 includes race entry, meal tickets, camping, Friday spaghetti dinner, free showers, and bike wash for 88 miles of Colorado mountain gravel. That's solid value for a weekend camping trip with 10,000 feet of climbing. Standard pricing jumps to $155, which pushes but doesn't break the threshold for the region."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "On-site camping eliminates hotel costs in tourist country where lodging gets expensive fast. Free post-race meals, Friday spaghetti dinner, and bike wash reduce additional spending. Kremmling isn't a destination dining scene, so meal costs stay reasonable beyond what's included. Biggest expense is reaching rural Colorado from population centers."
