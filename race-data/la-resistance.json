The organized race appears defunct since 2016, leaving self-supported riders to handle French Alps logistics entirely alone. Talloires location on Lake Annecy means tourist-zone pricing without race infrastructure."

Similar distance to Crusher in the Tushar."

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "VecchioJo calls French gravel \"more rough hewn, chunky and fibrous\" than \"finely graded miles of hardpacked aggregate\" from \"American Marketing Dream\" riding. On the Route de la Soif, \"it can be difficult to control speed on the descents while trying to pick the best line through clusters of rocks,\" demanding concentration but favoring sustained power over technical skills. Less technical than The Mid South."

Combined with gravel sectors, this creates \"physical reserves\" draining alpine punishment throughout 65 miles. More climbing than SBT GRVL at the same score."

        "explanation": "The 2016 reconnaissance hit \"the worst rain Europe had experienced in quite a while\" with snow banks blocking the Route de la Soif requiring riders to \"shoulder the bike and clamber across.\" VecchioJo reports losing \"feeling in my extremities\" on exposed hairpins. September timing avoids peak weather extremes, but mountain conditions change rapidly above treeline. Similar climate challenges to SBT GRVL."

        "explanation": "Riders emerge \"out of the tree line in the upper reaches\" of Col de l'Arpettaz to \"spectacular view of the Aravis Alps – jagged peaks set in a sea of green fields, accompanied by the gentle clang of cowbells.\" The Haute Savoie location and exposed alpine terrain create significant elevation effects without reaching oxygen-debt extremes. Similar altitude considerations to Grinduro."
      },
      "adventure": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "VecchioJo describes the Route de la Soif as \"real mountain riding and not the place to cock it up\" with the mountain's \"brooding presence\" creating \"spectacular and silently foreboding\" atmosphere. The route honors French Resistance fighters who died at Glières Plateau, ending at the National Monument and necropolis where 463 fighters made their last stand."

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Entry was limited to 463 riders - matching the number of Resistance fighters at Glières - but the inaugural 2016 event appears to have folded shortly after. Despite the meaningful WWII tribute and Mavic support with \"bright yellow Service Course motos loaded with spare wheels,\" the race never gained sustained traction in the competitive gravel scene."
      },

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "The €95 entry included Mavic jerseys and \"La Guinguette\" lakeside party, with professional wheel support on course. However, riders faced navigation errors and extreme weather bailouts even in the inaugural year. The relaxed \"ride not a race\" philosophy and subsequent folding suggest organizational challenges despite good intentions and scenic Talloires beach setting."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Stu Bowers found his \"bottles supped dry and legs close to cramp\" after the \"brutal\" Glières climb drained his \"physical reserves.\" The route creates emotional weight through WWII history, spectacular Mont Blanc views from Route de la Soif, and the contrast between Lake Annecy's beauty and alpine suffering above. The experience transforms riders through \"real mountain\" challenge."
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "The inaugural atmosphere was \"all very relaxed\" with riders encouraged to \"take some moments at each La Resistance memorial to honour the memory of those who refused to stand down.\" Organizers Adam Horler and Ross Muir fostered a social vibe over competitive racing, though the limited 463-rider field and subsequent event folding prevented sustained community building."
      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "The 463-rider cap honored historical significance but created a small field. Riders ranged from those on \"23mm tyres\" and borrowed \"tubs that survived Paris-Roubaix\" to recreational cyclists on modified road bikes. Despite attracting varied skill levels to the inaugural event, no notable competitive depth or returning elite field developed before the race folded. Less competitive depth than Almanzo 100."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "€95 entry included Mavic jersey, La Guinguette party ticket, and professional wheel support on challenging alpine terrain. The first 100 entrants received Mavic caps, and the lakeside finish party encouraged \"period costume.\" The historical significance and French Alps setting provided meaningful value, though the event's brief lifespan limited long-term community investment."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Registration runs €80-120. VecchioJo recommends \"30mm+ tyres\" minimum, noting 28mm \"right on the limit of acceptability,\" while Stu Bowers found 40mm ideal for the \"clusters of rocks\" and loose surfaces. Beyond tire requirements, Talloires sits in expensive Lake Annecy tourist territory. French Alps location means premium costs for lodging, meals, and transport without organized race logistics support. Higher total cost than Badlands."
