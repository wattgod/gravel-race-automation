Talloires location on Lake Annecy means tourist-zone pricing without race infrastructure."

Similar distance to Crusher in the Tushar."

Less technical than The Mid South."

September timing avoids peak weather extremes, but mountain conditions change rapidly above treeline. Similar climate challenges to SBT GRVL."

Similar altitude considerations to Grinduro."

        "explanation": "VecchioJo describes the Route de la Soif as \"real mountain riding and not the place to cock it up\" with the mountain's \"brooding presence\" creating \"spectacular and silently foreboding\" atmosphere.

The relaxed \"ride not a race\" philosophy and subsequent folding suggest organizational challenges despite good intentions and scenic Talloires beach setting."

The experience transforms riders through \"real mountain\" challenge."

        "explanation": "The inaugural atmosphere was \"all very relaxed\" with riders encouraged to \"take some moments at each La Resistance memorial to honour the memory of those who refused to stand down.\" Organizers Adam Horler and Ross Muir fostered a social vibe over competitive racing, though the limited 463-rider field and subsequent event folding prevented sustained community building."

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "The 463-rider cap honored historical significance but created a small field. Riders ranged from those on \"23mm tyres\" and borrowed \"tubs that survived Paris-Roubaix\" to recreational cyclists on modified road bikes. Despite attracting varied skill levels to the inaugural event, no notable competitive depth or returning elite field developed before the race folded. Less competitive depth than Almanzo 100."

      "expenses": {
        "score": 2,

VecchioJo recommends \"30mm+ tyres\" minimum, noting 28mm \"right on the limit of acceptability,\" while Stu Bowers found 40mm ideal for the \"clusters of rocks\" and loose surfaces. Beyond tire requirements, Talloires sits in expensive Lake Annecy tourist territory. French Alps location means premium costs for lodging, meals, and transport without organized race logistics support. Higher total cost than Badlands."

Today we have a close look at the gravel section which joins the two sides of the climb. Join me for future videos https://www.youtube.com/@CyclingInTheAlps&quot;Sub_Confirmation=1&quot;\n\n\nThe south side of Plateau des Glieres has been used twice in the Tour de France and also featured in the 2018 Etape du Tour from Annecy to Les Grand Bornand.\n\nToday I'm riding the climb from the north side of Plateau des Glieres before reaching the summit and traversing the alpine gravel section to the tarmac of the south side. This ride is doable from the  Chamonix Mont-Blanc region combining both a stunning road ride and a gravel section suitable for most road bikes. The gravel ride, the World War 2 history of Plateau des Glieres and the stunning scenery combine for an epic gravel road bike adventure. \n\nPlease click this link to discover more about Plateau des Glieres during World War 2 https://www.plateaudesglieres.fr/le-territoire/histoire-du-plateau/\n\nRiding from Annemasse - host town of the 2023 Etape du Tour, is not too far before you reach Thorens Glieres and the start of the climb from the north side. Over the top and you drop down to the les Grand Bornand to Bonneville road making a great circuit even adding in the Col des Aravis and the Col de la Colombiere.\n\nIts a difficult climb on both sides and ramps up steeply. \n\nCycling inspiration music promoted by EpidemicSound.com\n\nCycling in the Alps is brought to you from our base at the foot of Mont Blanc close to Chamonix, France.

          "description": "Chris Froome having some issues on this limestone-gravel section of the stage. \n(The remote plateau was important to the French resistance and to refugees. It was the site of a military disaster for the resistance in March 1944, losing 120-odd men killed in fighting, executed after capture or not surviving deportation, as it pulled out of the plateau, outnumbered by Vichy French government forces and the German army. The German army lost 3 men. Two thirds of the resistance force were captured. Denunciation by collaborators played a part. Nonetheless the events may have helped the resistance win over public opinion and provoke greater assistance from the allies. After the war General de Gaulle encouraged the growth of a myth of a great resistance battle (eventually debunked by historians) and the plateau became a spiritual home of resistance memory, site of the monument national de la Résistance, and, as one sees in this clip, it remains so.)",
