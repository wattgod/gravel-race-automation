Wisconsin summer weather delivers everything from perfect 70-degree mornings to humid 90-degree sufferfests with afternoon thunderstorms. The variability keeps things interesting, but humidity and potential weather changes require preparation. Similar climate challenges to SBT GRVL."

        "score": 1,

      "race_quality": {
        "score": 2,

      "experience": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Oconomowoc sits in decent lake country terrain, but with no documented aid stations, course features, or participant services, the experience defaults to self-supported ride through rolling farmland."

      "community": {
        "score": 3,

      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "With a field of 100-200 riders, without published results or presence in competitive cycling databases, the racing field remains unknown. No documented competitive field means minimal depth for serious racers. Thinner field than Ouray Gravel Grinder."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Wisconsin pricing typically runs reasonable compared to destination events. The 70-mile distance delivers solid mileage for your money, and Wisconsin events traditionally skip the premium pricing of more prestigious races."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Registration runs $50-75. Oconomowoc sits close to Milwaukee and Madison, providing decent lodging options without resort pricing. Wisconsin generally keeps accommodation and food costs reasonable, though weekend rates near lake areas bump up slightly. Similar expense level to Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."
