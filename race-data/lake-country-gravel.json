          "transcript": "Hello viewers. So I've just survived my\nfirst ever UCI gravel event just about\nit was a close call at times but I got\naround in mostly one piece and I\ndefinitely learned a few lessons and\nmade some mistakes along the way which\nI'll share in today's video. And also\nwe're here for some actual pros and more\nexperienced gravel cyclists about the\ntips and wisdom they can share with us\nall today which is especially important\nif you are doing your first ever gravel\nrace event or sportive. Better to learn\nfrom other people's mistakes than make\nthem yourself. So before we hear from\nthe pros, let me share my experience\nfrom riding the GRIC in Scotland at the\nweekend and the mistakes I made and the\ntips I would share with you based on my\nexperience. The first one is don't start\ntoo fast. I made the mistake of getting\ncaught up in the race for the first\ncorner, the first climb, and going way\nharder than I had planned. I'm a I'm a\nsucker for getting carried away at the\nstart of a race. And it was made\nespecially tough because we weren't able\nto warm up before the race. So going\nfrom standill to full gas in a matter of\nseconds was very tough on my old body.\nSo I would recommend a warm up before\nthe race or event if you can which\nwasn't available at the gratic because\nwe had to line up in our age pens about\n45 minutes before the start. So we stood\naround for ages with cold legs. So that\nmade it really tough. So given that cold\nstart, I would should have gone for a\nslightly more relaxed start. But I know\nthe importance of getting a good start,\nnot getting held up in traffic in the\nsort of pinch points through town and\ninto the first climb. And my aim was to\nget a good start and then provide some\nsliding space on the first climb, which\nI definitely did slide. I slid a long\nway back on that first climb as my my\nbody was screaming at me, my heart rate\nthrough the roof, and my glutes were\nshouting at me very loudly because of\nwhat I was asking from them from a cold\nstart. So unless you're racing to win,\nwhich I wasn't, and you are just racing\nto finish, maybe don't be so caught up\nin the start line pandemonium and ride\nto your own heart rate. Right to power\nif you have a power meter on your bike\nand try and pace yourself better than I\ndid on the first climb. I have a big\nmistake, the biggest one I regret is\ngoing higher on the tire pressures than\nI would normally do. I was freaked out\nby people punchering on the recon and my\nown experience of the recon and\nrealizing the gravel in Scotland in this\narea of Scotland is way tougher and way\nharder than anywhere I experienced in my\nlife. So to minimize the risk of\npunching even running tubeless because\neven with no inner tube to pinch with\ntubeless you can still pinch the tire\nsidewalls between a rock and a rim and\nit's also damaging the rims to be\nconscious about as well. So I went\nhigher on the tire pressures to minimize\nthe risk of a failure. But in doing so,\nI minimized the amount the tire can\ndeform on a rough ground and minimize\nhow much suspension I effectively had.\nAnd my arms just couldn't cope with the\nrelentless pounding over 4 hours of\nracing. So I should have stuck to my\nguns. as stuck to low pressures I know\nwork for me and relied on my faith in my\nequipment choices on the day and not be\ndeterred by what's happening around me\non the the day before the race. Those\nthen are the mistakes I made and the\ntips I take away from my first ever UCI\ngravel race. But now, let's hear from\nsome actual gravel pros who did much\nbetter in a race than I did and some\nmuch more experienced and seasoned\ngravel riders about the tips and wisdom\nthey can share with us in today's video.\nI would definitely say make sure to take\ncare of your equipment in this race\nespecially cuz it it's pretty rocky.\nIt's pretty chunky out there and a lot\nof people's races ended last year like\nmine last year ended just with like a a\nbig hit and I just was using wheels that\nweren't strong enough. Um so you broke\nyour wheels. I broke my front wheel.\nOkay. So, I kind of had to limp home the\nlast 15k or so and my race is done. Like\nI just stopped thinking I had a flat and\nI stopped and sealant was coming through\nthe rim. Uh so, so that was a pretty\nthat was pretty bad. But yeah, I would\nsay yeah, have your uh equipment dialed\nand when in doubt or there's a a classic\nsaying in Canada at least like it's\nbetter to be looking at it than looking\nfor it. So, it's better to have in this\nrace like a bit wider tires, having foam\ninserts, a little bit lower pressure\njust because yesterday if you're like\nwith road you're everyone's nickeling\nand dimming like oh I got I have to have\nthese aeros socks I have to have this\nhelmet's faster than this helmet where\ngravel it's like well we're going to\naverage 30 odd tomorrow and it's half up\nhalf down and like the aerodynamics on a\ndownhill are less important and uphill\nyou're going 20k an hour and it's it's\nbetter just to have maybe a couple more\nwatts here and there but have like a\nreally a bike you can trust\nI think is really key. And then for\nnutrition, it's just keep getting it in.\nI'm going to use the uh Castelli has\nlike a a hydro pack for the back. So\nlast year there was bottles being\njettisoned all over the course on some\nof the rockier downhills. So I just have\nthe hydro bag. So I'm like, \"Okay, got\nthe foam inserts. I got the wide tires.\nMy all the liquid I need is on my back.\nSo if I lose a bottle, it's like, okay,\nI have enough water, the bare minimum on\nmy back to get me through the whole\nrace.\" Um especially because Grow\nit's very nature conscious and they\ndon't want people driving all over in\nthe national park here.\nUm it's it's good to just make sure you\nhave the stuff you need at the start.\nHave a bike you can trust and not like\nnot risk it cuz it's a it's a long lot a\nlong way to come up here to Scotland and\nrun too narrow of tires or road pedals\nor something where it's like oh that\nbroke my race is done. My day is done.\nSo that would be my advice is\nplay it safe. for food and for\nequipment. We're here at the Grow. Yes.\nWhat one bit of advice would you give to\nsomebody doing their first gravel event,\nwhether racing or just riding for fun?\nIs there one bit of advice that you\nwould offer them or mistakes to avoid?\nUh bike setup or nutrition or casing?\nWhat's the thing? Can I give two? You\ncan give two. Yeah, of\ncourse. A lot of salt on board cuz you\nespecially like it's I mean it's\nprobably about 50° right now. You will\nlose so much salt. get salt tablets in\nyou. I think that's a thing that a lot\nof people just don't do correctly anyway\nwhen they're hydrating is like you need\nsalt as well as water to be able to\nhydrate. So take on salt. Uh and my\nsecond one would be put the biggest\ntires you can on your bike cuz like in\nterms of comfort makes a massive\ndifference. A third one use a tire\npressure calculator. Stra do one,\nWolftooth do one. They are really good\nat giving you an idea of what kind of\npressures you should be running and\nit'll probably come out a lot lower than\nyou think, especially if you're coming\nfrom more of a road background. Uh, but\ntrust the process. Take a little bit out\nevery time and the confidence it will\ngive you is unbelievable. I I I mean I I\ndid the\nthe Flanders Sport what a month or so\nago and I ran 32s\non a Argon 18 Krypton which is their\nlike all road bike and I ran 30 PSI.\nWow. Okay, that's low. Yeah, I had I had\na great time. And on this I'm running\n20. Please put your hands\ntogether to 54. I mean I just went that\nfeels about right. That'll do. I did\ncheck it. Yeah, about two days ago. But\nlower better generally. Lower is\ngenerally scared going low. Yeah,\nexactly. I think I think a lot of people\nare quite nervous about that, but it\nwill really change your experience a\nlot, I think. And it will give you a lot\nmore confidence, especially especially\ndescending some of the rough stuff. It\nreally does change that. Hi, I'm Toby\nPerry and I'm from Ashford, Kent. And\nwhat bit of advice would you give to\nsomebody doing gravel for the first\ntime? I'd say just be confident and\ntrust your bike because it can do a lot\nmore than you think. That simple. Yeah.\nYeah. do that. Everyone gets really\nnervous and twitchy and when you tense\nup is when you crash and have problems.\nSo, as long as you're calm, you end up\nbeing fine. What give you like bike\nsetup equipment choices, gearing, tires?\nUh, slightly wider tires is always just\nnice for extra bit of grip and that and\njust gives extra bit of comfort. So,\nyeah, it fits like biggest tires you can\nfit on your bike normally and see what\nsee what you enjoy. just checking\neverything's tight and the amount of\npeople I see with like just their shoe\ncleat that come loose after two hours of\ngravel and I have I've had it happen to\nme where my cleat and I've lost the\ncleat bolt. So just checking\neverything's at the right torque, the\nright settings and that's how I can only\nsay to people prepare your bike. Like\njust\ndon't just think, oh yeah, it's tires\nand everything else. It's it's\neverything. My biggest tip would be\nimproving your bike handling skills. And\nI think this is the problem that most\nriders have when they're doing their\nfirst gravel event. It's not like road\nwhere there's a you can just pick any\nline. You need to look through the\ncorners, pick your lines very carefully.\nUh basically hits the apex and then exit\nthe corners. And yeah, always looking\nahead of you if there's any obstacles\ncoming up such as large rocks. You don't\nwant to be hitting those. So yeah, just\nimproving your confidence on the bike as\nmuch as possible. I think that would be\njust a general really good tip that a\nlot of people can improve from. So there\nwe are. Hopefully some useful tips and\nadvice if you are doing your first\ngravel event. And if you are, let us\nknow what event you're doing by dropping\na comment down below. And if you are\nwatching this and you have done some\ngravel events and you feel there's some\nadvice and tips that were missed in\ntoday's video, then feel free to drop a\ncomment down below. But that is all for\ntoday. I'll see you again very soon.\nThank you so much for watching.",

But this time, I added pressure: finish by 9:33 PM before the sun sets, or face the final miles in the uncomfortable cold and darkness like I did before.\n\nThe timing was simple but brutal: 204 miles in 15 hours 33 minutes. No room for long breaks, mechanical issues, or mental lapses. Every mile mattered in this race against time and daylight.\n\nFollow my journey from start to finish as I battle fatigue, doubt, and the relentless Michigan terrain. You'll see the strategy, the mix of emotions, and the moment-by-moment decisions that determined whether I'd cross the finish line in sunlight or shadows.\n\nThis wasn't just about completing 200+ miles again - it was about proving I could do it faster, smarter, and under pressure.

          "transcript": "So, at this point, I'm 150 miles in and\nI'm hiking my bike. My feet are\nthrobbing and my legs are wobbly.\nStarting to question the decisions that\ngot me here, but at the same time, I'm\nloving every moment.\nI find joy in the challenge\nand thrill in the descent.\nWhile striving to achieve my goal of\nbeating the sun by finishing before\nsunset.\nThe Michigan Coast to Coast is a 204\nmile race across the lower peninsula.\nStarting in all grey on Lake Hiron, it\nprimarily travels gravel roads through\nfarmland before snaking through the\noff-road vehicle trails of the Manaste\nNational Forest. It finishes in Lington\non Lake Michigan. The course is about\n6,700 ft of climbing, but deceptively\nalmost all of it comes in the second\nhalf.\n&gt;&gt; We rolled out at 6:00 a.m. just after\nsunrise. This was my second 200 mile\nrace, so my goal is not only to finish,\nbut also to beat the sun. Meaning\nfinishing less than about 15 and 1/2\nhours. Something that a little over half\nthe riders achieve when the weather is\ngood.\nThe roads and gravel start smooth and\nfast. Several groups form and work\ntogether to make the first 54 miles to\nCP1 go really quickly.\nHeat\nup here.\nEven though I paced carefully, the group\nhelped me set a new 100m PB of about 6\nhours. It's noon and I'm on track to\nbeat the sun. I feel great. The plan is\nworking. However, I know the real\nchallenge begins after checkpoint 2 in\nmile 104.\nRoad's sandy. You can hear it.\nIt's just a little bit tougher going.\n&gt;&gt; After CP2, flat roads turned to rollers\nand the group spread out. This was the\nstart of the tough middle.\n&gt;&gt; Climbing up to mile 116,\njust a little climb here. Steep, but\nthis is the highest point on the course.\nI'd love to see fall downhill from\nthere, but there's a whole bunch of\nlittle things, but on average, it's\ndownhill.\nThat was fun when it lasted.\nAround mile 128, we entered Manaste\nNational Forest and turned onto off-road\nvehicle trails. The terrain was great\nhere and the extra bike handling was\nfun.\nmile 143 brought a small stretch of\nsoothingly smooth road and a muchneeded\nwater break due to the afternoon heat.\nHowever, the next 11 miles would be the\ntoughest of the day by far. I had no\nidea how long they would take and if I'd\nbe able to keep up my pace to beat the\nsun.\nwhite bear.\nI love\nHeat.\nLittle hike bike. After several miles of\njust relentless sand, I'm just trying to\nhold on and keep my pace up.\nJack it up.\nHeat. Heat. N.\nThe sandy trails were really testing\ntired legs and bike handling skills. It\nwas hard, but I was still making pretty\ngood time. And in retrospect, I really\nlike this part of the course.\nAfter about 160 miles, you can tell I'm\ngetting really tired here. I probably\nshould have been able to ride up this.\nAnd look how much my bike is tilted as I\nwalk up this hill.\n&gt;&gt; At mile 169, we reached checkpoint\nnumber three.\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\n&gt;&gt; A cheering crowd really lifts the\nspirits. That was a tough stretch. 65\nmiles in 6 hours.\nIt's just before 6:00 p.m. I'm tired and\nsore, but I'm encouraged since my goal\nof beating the sun looks to be within\nreach. I just need to do 35 miles in the\n3 and 1/2 hours before sunset.\nThis is the infamous climbing Big M.\nIt's honestly not that big. It's like\n100 ft or so. It's just\ndouble brakes riding over roots.\ninfinite power.\nWe'll see. We'll see.\nOh,\nneed to bite it. Got to think now.\nLet's\nsing.\n&gt;&gt; 187 miles in.\n&gt;&gt; Tired, man. But uh still getting water\nand food in me, so I think be all right.\n&gt;&gt; Definitely going to beat the sun. Hoping\nfor 9:00, if not earlier. It's just hard\nto tell these roads.\n&gt;&gt; 2002\nto go.\nHere\nwe are.\n&gt;&gt; Home stretch. That's a half mile to go.\nFeel like I'm finishing strong,\nbut it has been a hard one.\nHere we are. Here we are. Thank you.\nwrapping up their ride. I see a smile on\nthat face.\n&gt;&gt; You got it done. You got it done.\n&gt;&gt; That was done.\n&gt;&gt; All right, here's the ceremonial dip.\nI'll be right there. Close to the sun.\nKeep holding on.\nAnd I'll be right there close to the",

SUBSCRIBE for Race Content 👉 https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsr-SU_SAqjrzmu4kXIRfUQ?sub_confirmation=1\n\nLead group 38 mi  race! \n\nFinal gravel race of the season! Since I locked up 4th place in the overall Michigan Gravel Race Series (MGRS) and couldn't gain enough points to overtake 3rd, I decided to make this my Iceman MTB race prep. The short course, 39 miles, would be closer to my expected Iceman finish time in 2 weeks, so I raced that distance instead of my typical long course 56 mile. I didn't feel the best on the day but I was able to hold onto the front group into the final 20 person sprint. Legs were cooked by then and I made some poor tactical decisions in the end, which left me way back and out of position for the sprint. I was able to salvage 8th place overall, 2nd in my age group. \n\nHeld on October 25,  2025, this was the last race of the gravel season and the Michigan Gravel Race Series. The Lowell gravel race is a classic style gravel race. You race along the banks of the Flat River and through rural Ionia County, MI on approximately 95% unpaved roads. You can choose from either the 56, 39 or 15 mile routes, all are single loops. The race start sand finishes at Fallasburg County Park, Lowell, MI. \n\n👉 Hey!
