      "length": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "128km across three days hits the sweet spot for stage racing. Rachel Sokal learned to 'do a bit less chatting and a bit more breathing on the transition climb' — those untimed sections between stages still demand pacing discipline."

      "technicality": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Rachel Sokal describes 'nearly 20 km of undulating trails on ever changing grades of gravel' as epic terrain. Access to Day 1's final stage requires 'winching up a 20% gradient climb' — this isn't fire road gravel."
      },
      "elevation": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "6km of 'gradual uphill' proved 'torturous' even for competitive rider Rachel Sokal, who regretted her 'usual flat-riding gearing' throughout both days. Day 2's 1,500m climbing across 60km maintains the Welsh mountain punishment."

      "altitude": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Cambrian Mountains deliver climbing without altitude effects. The challenge here is gradient and volume, not thin air — even the highest points won't affect your oxygen levels."

      "adventure": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Three-day camping in the Cambrian Mountains with stages through remote terrain like Cwm Berwen. The final stage features 'a spectacular fast descent on a winding track through an old lead mine' with no chance to stop and appreciate it."
      },
      "prestige": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Elite riders like Emily Tillett compete here, but she won a stage while dealing with mechanicals — suggesting the field depth allows breakthrough performances. Seven editions deep, it's established regionally but lacks broader recognition."
      },
      "race_quality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Emily Tillett summarizes it perfectly: 'Day 1 brought both mechanical issues and a stage win — a pretty good summary of gravel: highs and lows in a single ride.' The format works, execution has rough edges."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "The rally-style format creates 'rolling social rides' between timed stages rather than constant racing pressure. Most route is untimed, letting riders pace the transfers and focus energy on the competitive sections."
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Emily Tillett notes 'with no phone signal at the campsite, the social side carries on into the evening, with people sitting around and sharing stories from the day. It feels more like a weekend away than a race weekend.'"
      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "400 riders with elite competitors like Emily Tillett mixing with recreational riders. The gravel ethos means 'wear what works, ride at the pace that suits you' — competitive but not cutthroat depth."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "£120 gets you three days of Welsh wilderness racing plus camping, but Rachel Sokal highlights extras like 'spot prizes from the sponsors, the gravy on the chips or the dodgy dancing' as part of the weekend package."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Rural Wales location means driving hours from major cities and camping by necessity. Rachel Sokal packed 'multiple pairs of riding shoes and an almost infinite combination of sleeves and waterproofs' — gear redundancy costs add up."
