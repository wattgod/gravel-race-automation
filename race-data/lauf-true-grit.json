        "explanation": "St. George Regional Airport (10 miles) has limited flights, so most fly to Las Vegas (2 hours). Multiple shuttle services available including Salt Lake Express and St. George Shuttle, but adds complexity and $45+ cost. Good hotel options in St. George including cyclist-friendly LOGE property."
      },
      "length": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Race director Corey Godfrey notes 'riders must either carry everything they need for the day or resupply at our mandatory checkpoints' with no outside assistance allowed. The self-sufficiency requirement and technical terrain make 84 miles ride significantly longer than typical gravel events."
      },
      "technicality": {
        "score": 5,
        "explanation": "Among the most technical gravel races in existence. Mandatory dismounts, rock gardens, sandy washes, slickrock, and the infamous Rollers of Doom. 80% off-road with singletrack sections requiring pre-riding. Course includes Bear Claw Poppy trail early and technical Zen Trail section."
      },
      "elevation": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Godfrey describes the terrain: 'You can be in the middle of Lincoln and in 10 to 15 minutes be on gravel in the country. The elevation can also vary. To the northwest of Lincoln are the Bohemian Alps, which have a lot of rolling hills.' 9,000 feet of climbing across multiple ridges creates relentless demands."
      },
      "climate": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "March in southern Utah offers generally pleasant conditions (highs 65-72F) but the desert is fickle. Morning starts in upper 30s require layering, and overnight rain has forced last-minute course changes in past editions. Generally sunny with 9-11 hours of daylight."
      },
      "altitude": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Never exceeds 5,000 feet elevation despite community data mentioning 11,000 ft (likely referring to climbing total, not altitude). Minimal altitude impact on performance - one of the few mercies this course offers riders."
      },
      "adventure": {
        "score": 5,
        "explanation": "Stunning convergence of three distinct ecosystems - red sandstone formations, white cliffs, ancient volcanic remnants. The course traverses Mojave Desert, Great Basin, and Colorado Plateau meeting point with otherworldly desert vegetation. Universally praised as bucket-list beautiful terrain."
      },
      "prestige": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Godfrey aimed to create an event with a 'polished, grassroots vibe' rather than carnival atmosphere. NUE Series opener brings credibility and attracts strong regional competition. Growing recognition as one of the most technically demanding gravel courses in North America."
      },
      "race_quality": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Race director Cimarron Chacon brings 15+ years of experience and helped design many course segments herself. Godfrey notes the most satisfying part is 'seeing someone dig deep and accomplish something they weren't sure they could do at the start.' Professional organization with local expertise."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 5,
        "explanation": "The combination of technical demands and otherworldly scenery creates unforgettable racing. Small town start/finish with expo and live music adds character. 250-person cap creates intimate atmosphere where 'shared suffering of technical terrain bonds finishers in a unique way.'"
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Godfrey's philosophy centers on accessibility: 'If you wanted to join the team or participate in an event, all you had to do was show up and ride.' The 'pirate theme' promotes events without sanctioning body barriers. Strong local community investment from founder-led organization creates welcoming atmosphere."
      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "NUE Series connection attracts endurance talent with past winners including Colin Strickland, Rebecca Rusch, and Neil Shirley. Godfrey notes 'the level of competition and the prestige of being a World Champion keeps the Elite riders coming back' but field remains regionally focused."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Outstanding course quality and organization for the price. The deliberate grassroots approach avoids carnival-like spectacle but delivers meaningful race experience. You're paying for access to one of the most unique and technically demanding gravel courses available."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Utah location requires travel investment. Las Vegas flight plus shuttle services like Salt Lake Express ($45+) or rental car adds up. St. George hotels reasonable ($100-200/night range). Total trip likely $800-1,200 depending on travel choices and accommodation preferences."

        {
          "topic": "Technical Demands",
          "truth": "This is NOT a gravel race for gravel beginners. Mandatory dismounts, rock gardens requiring specific line knowledge, and the infamous Zen and Barrel Ride sections have humbled experienced riders who practiced lines dozens of times. If you're uncomfortable on technical terrain, you will have a bad day."
        },
        {
          "topic": "Pre-Ride Requirement",
          "truth": "Unlike most gravel races where you can show up and pin a number, True Grit demands course reconnaissance. The race director explicitly recommends pre-riding technical sections. Lines that look manageable in practice freeze riders on race day when fatigue hits."
        },
        {
          "topic": "Equipment Reality",
          "truth": "Course was designed with Lauf suspension fork in mind. While you don't NEED a Lauf bike, rigid forks will suffer on 84 miles of rocks. Some suspension or serious compliance is highly recommended - gravel purists on rigid setups will question their life choices."
        },
        {
          "topic": "Weather Chaos",
          "truth": "The desert can flip on you overnight. Past editions have seen rain-forced course changes announced the morning of the race. One year, a missed trail turn-off created a 'herd of buffalo diving off a cliff' scenario as riders scrambled down a muddy bank."
        },
        {
          "topic": "Perceived Difficulty",
          "truth": "84 miles reads manageable on paper. Reality: this course rides like 100+ miles. Training recommendation from veterans is to prepare for 125% of race distance. No shade, relentless climbing, and technical fatigue compound into suffering that transcends the mileage."
        },
        {
          "topic": "Small Event Trade-offs",
          "truth": "The 250-person field creates intimate racing but less festival atmosphere. If you're seeking the Unbound experience of thousands of riders and massive expo village, True Grit will feel small. This is a race for racers, not an event for the Instagram moments."

    "final_verdict": {
      "score": "74 / 100",
      "one_liner": "Utah's technical playground where your handling skills matter more than your FTP and the Rollers of Doom separate pretenders from the genuinely prepared.",
      "should_you_race": "Show up if you're comfortable dismounting on steep rock faces and practicing technical lines a dozen times before race day. The 9,000 feet of climbing rides like a century because of the constant technical demands—your bike handling needs to be sharp when you're deep into hour six. Skip this if you prefer smooth gravel roads or think a dropper post is overkill for gravel racing.",
      "alternatives": "Dirty Kanza offers similar distance with less technical punishment, while McDowell Mountain Frenzy gives you desert beauty without the constant dismount-and-carry sections. Both let you actually use your fitness instead of spending half the day walking your bike over sandstone."
    },
    "course_description": {
      "character": "True Grit drops you into the geological chaos where three deserts collide—Mojave, Great Basin, and Colorado Plateau. Eighty percent off-road through sandstone mazes, volcanic remnants, and sandy washes that chew up bikes and spit out undertrained riders. This isn't gravel racing, it's technical mountain biking disguised as a gravel event.",
