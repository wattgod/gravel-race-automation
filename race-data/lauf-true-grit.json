        "explanation": "Elite rider Carey Lowery describes race morning at 38°F requiring careful layering decisions - she overdressed with arm and leg warmers, stripping arm warmers early but keeping leg warmers for crash protection on technical Zen rocks. St. George Regional Airport sits 10 miles away with limited flights, so most fly to Las Vegas requiring 2-hour shuttle services like Salt Lake Express."
      },

        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Carey Lowery tackled what she calls '45 miles, 5500 feet gain' with a 4:15 goal time, finishing in 4:31:46. The neutral rollout through Santa Clara town quickly turns brutal - 'once we turned left and hit the double track, everyone dropped the hammer! The first couple climbs were a punch to the gut for me and soon I was dangling off the back.' Longer than Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego. As Carey Lowery puts it: \"I had my own personal goals: have FUN, don't CRASH, MOTIVATE others, and CLEAN the Waterfall. I also gave myself a time goal: 4:15.\""

        "explanation": "Elite rider Carey Lowery studied video footage seven times to visualize The Waterfall's technical line: 'Enter to the left, sweep to the right, over the boulder, roll the drop, back to the left, ker-chunk, ker-chunk, ker-chunk.' She describes Zen as 'super techy, with punchy ledgey climbs' where she red-lined through most sections. Multiple riders flatted early on the descent to Zen loop. Among the most technical in gravel, on par with Badlands. As Carey Lowery puts it: \"The slickrock is amazingly grippy. To be able to climb super steep pitches without any rear wheel spin is so much fun.\""

        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Godfrey describes the terrain: 'You can be in the middle of Lincoln and in 10 to 15 minutes be on gravel in the country. The elevation can also vary. To the northwest of Lincoln are the Bohemian Alps, which have a lot of rolling hills.' 9,000 feet of climbing across multiple ridges creates relentless demands. More climbing than SBT GRVL at the same score. As Carey Lowery puts it: \"The slickrock is amazingly grippy. To be able to climb super steep pitches without any rear wheel spin is so much fun.\""

        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Historical weather data shows average highs of 63°F and lows of 42°F, with a 34% chance of rain on any given day. March in southern Utah offers generally pleasant conditions (highs 65-72F) but the desert is fickle. Morning starts in upper 30s require layering, and overnight rain has forced last-minute course changes in past editions. Generally sunny with 9-11 hours of daylight. Similar climate challenges to SBT GRVL."
      },
      "altitude": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Never exceeds 5,000 feet elevation despite community data mentioning 11,000 ft (likely referring to climbing total, not altitude). Minimal altitude impact on performance - one of the few mercies this course offers riders. Modest altitude compared to Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."
      },
      "adventure": {
        "score": 5,
        "explanation": "Stunning convergence of three distinct ecosystems - red sandstone formations, white cliffs, ancient volcanic remnants. The course traverses Mojave Desert, Great Basin, and Colorado Plateau meeting point with otherworldly desert vegetation. Universally praised as bucket-list beautiful terrain."

      "prestige": {
        "score": 3,

        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Race director Cimarron Chacon brings 15+ years of experience and helped design many course segments herself. Godfrey notes the most satisfying part is 'seeing someone dig deep and accomplish something they weren't sure they could do at the start.' Professional organization with local expertise."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 5,
        "explanation": "The combination of technical demands and otherworldly scenery creates unforgettable racing. Small town start/finish with expo and live music adds character. 250-person cap creates intimate atmosphere where 'shared suffering of technical terrain bonds finishers in a unique way.'"
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Godfrey's philosophy centers on accessibility: 'If you wanted to join the team or participate in an event, all you had to do was show up and ride.' The 'pirate theme' promotes events without sanctioning body barriers. Strong local community investment from founder-led organization creates welcoming atmosphere."

        "explanation": "NUE Series connection attracts endurance talent with past winners including Colin Strickland, Rebecca Rusch, and Neil Shirley. Godfrey notes 'the level of competition and the prestige of being a World Champion keeps the Elite riders coming back' but field remains regionally focused. Similar competitive depth to Rule of Three. As Carey Lowery puts it: \"45 miles, 5500 feet gain. Race morning was 38 degrees. Forgetting that a Utah 38 is different than a Tennessee 38, I put on arm/leg warmers...\""

        "score": 4,

      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Utah location requires travel investment. Las Vegas flight plus shuttle services like Salt Lake Express ($45+) or rental car adds up. St. George hotels reasonable ($100-200/night range). Total trip likely $800-1,200 depending on travel choices and accommodation preferences. Similar expense level to Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

          "truth": "This is NOT a gravel race for gravel beginners. Mandatory dismounts, rock gardens requiring specific line knowledge, and the infamous Zen and Barrel Ride sections have humbled experienced riders who practiced lines dozens of times. If you're uncomfortable on technical terrain, you will have a bad day."

        {
          "topic": "Pre-Ride Requirement",
          "truth": "Unlike most gravel races where you can show up and pin a number, True Grit demands course reconnaissance. The race director explicitly recommends pre-riding technical sections. Lines that look manageable in practice freeze riders on race day when fatigue hits."
        },
        {
          "topic": "Equipment Reality",
          "truth": "Course was designed with Lauf suspension fork in mind. While you don't NEED a Lauf bike, rigid forks will suffer on 84 miles of rocks. Some suspension or serious compliance is highly recommended - gravel purists on rigid setups will question their life choices."
        },
        {
          "topic": "Weather Chaos",
          "truth": "The desert can flip on you overnight. Past editions have seen rain-forced course changes announced the morning of the race. One year, a missed trail turn-off created a 'herd of buffalo diving off a cliff' scenario as riders scrambled down a muddy bank."
        },
        {
          "topic": "Perceived Difficulty",
          "truth": "84 miles reads manageable on paper. Reality: this course rides like 100+ miles. Training recommendation from veterans is to prepare for 125% of race distance. No shade, relentless climbing, and technical fatigue compound into suffering that transcends the mileage."
        },
        {
          "topic": "Small Event Trade-offs",
          "truth": "The 250-person field creates intimate racing but less festival atmosphere. If you're seeking the Unbound experience of thousands of riders and massive expo village, True Grit will feel small. This is a race for racers, not an event for the Instagram moments."

Skip this if you prefer smooth gravel roads or think a dropper post is overkill for gravel racing.",
