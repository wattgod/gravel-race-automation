The course rolls through dense Northwoods, climbs for Lake Superior overlooks, and finishes in the tourist town of Grand Marais. It's not the hardest course (5,000 ft over 110 miles = rolling, not mountainous), but the field is international and fast. The scenery is world-class: dense Minnesota woods, Lake Superior vistas, and the iconic Gunflint Trail. Grand Marais is the perfect race town—hotels, restaurants, breweries, and post-race tourism. The large field means pack racing early and potential bottlenecks, but it thins out. This is a big-event, well-organized UCI race with all the amenities.",

It was VERY foggy and hard to see very far in front of me.\" Mike Ward got perfect conditions: \"Light enough winds, not too hot, bright sun all day.

          "description": "The Le Grand Du Nord is a gravel cycling event that takes place in northern Minnesota, United States in the Lake Superior harbor town of Grand Marais. The event is held on the Saturday of Memorial Day weekend annually.  \n\nAbout the course. It is a challenging and adventurous ride that showcases the scenic beauty of the region with Lake Superior and boreal forest views. Participants navigate a mix of gravel roads and some pavement while tackling various climbs and descents. \n\nAbout the race. The first Le Grand Du Nord was held in 2016 with less than 200 riders. Since then, it has strategically grown to 700 riders. The event was founded and is run by Jeremy Kershaw of Heck of the North Productions. Heck of the North organizes three other gravel grinder endurance races in Northern Minnesota.\n\n#gravelbike #endurancecycling #lakesuperior #visitcookcounty #donorthmn\n#northshoremn #bikerace #biking #bikelover #minnesota #onlyinmn #grandmarais",

Riders describe fast gravel conditions with some chunky B sections that remain manageable for various bike types including fat bikes. The remote course winds through wooded areas with no gas stations or stores, offering Lake Superior views and potential wildlife sightings including moose and wolves. Race starts are staggered with 110-mile at 8:15am and shorter distances at 9:15am. Four bottles recommended for hydration. The scenic Grand Marais finish area provides excellent spectator viewing as riders return to town."
