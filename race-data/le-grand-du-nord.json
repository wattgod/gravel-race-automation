The course rolls through dense Northwoods, climbs for Lake Superior overlooks, and finishes in the tourist town of Grand Marais. It's not the hardest course (5,000 ft over 110 miles = rolling, not mountainous), but the field is international and fast. The scenery is world-class: dense Minnesota woods, Lake Superior vistas, and the iconic Gunflint Trail. Grand Marais is the perfect race town—hotels, restaurants, breweries, and post-race tourism. The large field means pack racing early and potential bottlenecks, but it thins out. This is a big-event, well-organized UCI race with all the amenities.",

It was VERY foggy and hard to see very far in front of me.\" Mike Ward got perfect conditions: \"Light enough winds, not too hot, bright sun all day.
