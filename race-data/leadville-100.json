        "explanation": "100 miles on paper, actually ~104 miles due to finish routing. At altitude with 12,000ft of climbing, most riders are out 8-12 hours. The distance is compounded by thin air—it rides like 130+ miles at sea level."

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Despite the 'MTB' title, Leadville is mostly fire roads. Only 1-2 miles of true singletrack. Powerline descent is rough and rocky, but overall it's an endurance test, not a technical test. Pros race on drop-bar 'monster cross' bikes."

      "elevation": {
        "score": 5,
        "explanation": "12,000ft of climbing is massive. Five major climbs including Columbine (3,000ft gain) and Powerline (1,300ft at 20%+ grades). The out-and-back format means climbing Trail Creek twice. It never stops."
      },
      "climate": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "August in Colorado mountains is variable but generally manageable. Mornings are cool, afternoons can storm. Not the extreme heat of Kansas or Nebraska. The altitude is the bigger climate factor than temperature."

        "score": 5,
        "explanation": "The defining feature. Start at 10,200ft, peak at 12,424ft at Columbine Mine. You never drop below 9,200ft. Sea-level athletes lose 15-20% power output. Thin air makes every effort harder and recovery slower."
      },
      "logistics": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Leadville is remote—2 hours from Denver. Limited lodging in town books months out. Lottery entry means no guarantee of a spot. Crew logistics are complex with specific aid station rules."

        "score": 2,

It's not the hardest course technically—it's mostly fire roads—but the combination of 100 miles, 12,000ft climbing, and extreme altitude creates a legendary challenge. The belt buckle system gives everyone a goal. The 30-year history and pro field via LTGP keep it relevant. If you do one race in your life, many would say: do Leadville.",

The Columbine climb—3,000ft gain to 12,400ft—reduces most riders to walking regardless of fitness. Powerline's 20%+ grades at 11,000ft create conga lines of hike-a-bikers. You can be a strong cyclist and still walk half the climbs.",
