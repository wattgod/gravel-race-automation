You're grinding uphill for hours, not just tackling a few punchy climbs. The relentless vertical gain breaks legs and spirits; there's no hiding from the math when every mile averages more elevation than most people climb in a weekend ride. Among the hilliest in gravel, comparable to Badlands. As Victoria Weeks puts it: \"The steepest part of the grade is around 13%, with an average of 6.3%.

August in the Colorado Rockies means you start in pre-dawn cold and finish in afternoon heat, but altitude keeps temperatures manageable compared to desert races. Weather can turn fast above treeline—thunderstorms, hail, or blazing sun within hours of each other. The thin air dries you out faster than sea level, but you won't be melting in 110-degree furnace conditions like Arizona summer races. Milder conditions than Crusher in the Tushar."

Most people live at sea level; here you're racing where the air is 40% thinner than your lungs expect. Altitude sickness isn't theoretical—it's the invisible hand choking your power output for hours on end. Among the highest-altitude events in gravel, on par with Badlands. As Coach Sophie Evans puts it: \"If you don't live at altitude, your best defense (and offense) for the high altitude is to get as fit as you possibly can.\""

You're riding through Colorado wilderness, hitting historic mining territory, and joining a select group—only those who survive 12 hours in the thin air get the buckle. The sub-9-hour 'big buckle' is cycling's version of a black belt; maybe 150-200 riders out of 1,600 starters earn it each year."

          "transcript": "good morning everyone and welcome to\nLeadville Colorado it's an early start\nhere as anticipation builds for the\nstart of the Leadville Trail 100 MTB\npresented by\nkinetic they are not joking around with\nthe pace from the start I I think Ken\nalways says it at the start line right\nlike you really do need to commit commit\ncommit and whichever decision you make\nwhether it's right or wrong I think once\nyou make it you got to live with it you\ncould crash you could flat you could you\nknow break a\nchain I think Leadville attracts bold\npeople people willing to put everything\non the line people who are willing to\nfail already looks like she's put in\nclose to a 20 second Gap every second\nthat he can gain is going to\ncount I want to tell you it's going to\nhurt out there it's going to hurt real\nbad but when it does you just keep\ndigging deep and say to yourself one\nthing one thing let Bill let Bill\nanything more is not necessary anything\nless is not\nenough yes it's that time of year once\nagain we're in the high peaks of\nColorado you can feel summer beginning\nto fade into fall and cycling\nenthusiasts from all over the United\nStates and Beyond make the annual\npilgrimage to lead\nBill welcome to the 2024 lifetime\nLeadville Trail 100 MTB presented by\nkinetic this year for the first time on\nterrain just like this not only are they\nriding bicycles in Leadville they're\nracing them mountain bikes for 100 miles\nhaving started in 1994 this year marks\nthe 30th anniversary of what is\nconsidered to be one of the most\nprestigious CrossCountry mountain bike\nevents in the\nworld I've done 104 times we've done Le\nbuil three times once on our own twice\non the tandem over the last three\ndecades tens of thousands of riders have\nmustered the courage to attempt the 100m\ncourse enduring roughly 12,000 ft of\nelevation gain including the notorious\nclimb up Coline peaking at 12,500 ft you\nguys are putting off veteran VI first\ntime first time first time first time\nfiguring this all out we got you fools\nthose who succeeded and completed the\ncourse in Under 12 hours were rewarded\nwith gold and silver belt buckles and\nthe glory that comes with\nthem I like to do hard things but this\nis kind of you know you got to have\ndiscipline you got to have training you\nknow to get done and and so that's why I\nlike it today will be no different grit\nguts and determination will be on full\ndisplay as these writers both\nprofessional and amateur set out to\nconquer one of cycling's most iconic\nFeats we're all excited to be here in\nLeadville for what was supposed to be\nthe fourth stop in the 2024 lifetime\nGrand Prix presented by Mazda however\nthe third race Crusher in the tusher had\nto be cancelled due to the silver King\nand little twist forest fires the\noverall scoring will shift from best\nfive out of seven races to best four out\nof six with that in mind here is your\ncurrent Grand Prix leaderboard presented\nby\nsbl Keegan is in the lead with 59 points\npacon just a point back and Matt beers\nrounds out our top three with 56 points\nwith Lin Morton's win at Unbound he is\nsitting in fourth and Brendan Johnson\nrounds out our top five with 50\npoints for the women Haley Smith claimed\nthe top spot after Unbound and with 62\npoints holds a four-point margin over\nHan AO in second Sophia is in third\nseven points off the lead after them\nit's Sarah Sturm and Alexis scarta in\nfourth and fifth\nrespectively so some athletes have a lot\nto lose others have everything to gain\nlet's hear from some of the athletes and\nwinners from that first race in\n1994 yeah lville just gets in your heart\nyou know it it it makes a difference in\nyour life and you want to come back and\nyou want to share that fire share that\nexcitement and that they feel totally\nenveloped in the family so this is the\nfirst year bike I rode this Frame here\nin 1994 I tried to pump the tires up to\naround 50 psi which I think I rode back\nthen so I wouldn't pinch flat but this\nthing will knock your fillings out\nversus today's bikes that we're all\nriding uh we have four Riders and three\ndifferent setups basically you know\nbetween hard tail full suspension drop\nbar full suspension so today before the\nrace stays more clean you know\nfinalizing all the\ntweaks good morning everyone and welcome\nto Leadville Colorado today is the day\nwe've had hype building here for a\ncouple weeks now as Leadville hosted the\nstage race in the Expo and events have\nbeen teeing off but now it's time for\nthe main event it's an early start here\nand our professional athletes as well as\nour Mass start Riders are funneling in\nfilling up the Corrals as anticipation\nbuilds for the start of the Leadville\nTrail 100 MTB presented by kinetic\nunlike prior years when it comes to our\nElite men's and women's fields we will\nbe featuring separate starts so squeeze\nin there if you can and find your place\nalong the fencing on Sixth Street\nbecause we're only minutes away from the\nstart which promises to go off with a\nbang I want to tell you it's going to\ndigging deep we'll see you at the Finish\nLine family love you we'll see you at\nthe Finish love you 5 4 3 2\n[Music]\n1 this is our Pro men's field we've got\n28 of the Grand Prix Riders starting\ntoday along with some of the top Racers\nfrom around the world I think everyone\nhere is in it for the challenge just\ncomes down to how well you can breathe\nat you know 10,000 ft like that envelope\nhow much can you push it to survive\nthrough through power line or Coline and\nthen make it back Tobin on the front\ndriving the pace I ke in there sitting\non Tobin's wheel everyone's looking for\nthat day when they just like feel as\nlight as a feather and there they're\njust floating up the climbs that's\nthat's how it goes every say you you go\nas hard as you can and then you see\nwhat's left I was down at the start line\nthis morning and all the talk was that\nKeegan was thinking he could break sub\n530 this year it's honestly less about\nyou versus Coline you versus power line\nand it's more using Coline using power\nline maybe even using the boulevard\nagainst these other guys that you're\ntrying to pry a few seconds off of they\nare not joking around with the pace from\nthe start of course last year we all\nremember Keegan using Tobin in that\nRedHot start to help him absolutely\ndestroy the previous course record will\nit work again we'll check back in with\nthem in a moment and see how it's\nplaying out but first we're going to\nhead back to the start as the women are\nready to roll the start hurts no matter\nwhat you're cold it's dark then you just\nhit steep Switchback technical climbing\nand it's just\nSavage let's talk about some of our\nfavorites from the women field as we\nwatch them roll out Sophia Gomez vishaan\nlast year's winner 2022 winner Hannah\nAuto I think Leadville attracts bold\non the line people willing to be\nvulnerable to try their best at\nsomething people who are willing to fail\nfor the chance at succeeding also got\nMelisa Rollins in there Melissa was out\nfor the lifetime lead Bill stage race 2\nweeks ago and won the event actually in\na Time faster than what Sophia did in\nthe same event last year every single\nperson who lines up for lville I don't\ncare if you're a professional or if you\nhave a family and a desk job and you've\nflown out here across the country to do\nthis race every single person is going\nto have a beautiful moment and a really\nhorrible moment all you can do is just\nkeep trying to move forward Haley Smith\ntook a look over her left hand shoulder\nin the Canadian national championship\nkit keep our eye out for Haley Smith who\nis our current leader in the overall\nstandings of the Grand Prix I always\nwant a Podium spot I know I'm capable of\nit if I have the right day but yeah\nthat's bike racing you don't always get\nwhat you want or what you deserve so\nthere you have it the 2024 lifetime\nLeadville Trail 100 MTV presented by\nconnetic is underway as our Riders\ncontinue on their first climb of the\ntoday here's race director Tamara\njenlink with your course\nbreakdown the lifetime Leadville Trail\n100 MTB presented by kinetic is 105 M\nlong with 12,480 ft of elevation gain\nthese Racers will begin their day by\nheading south on\nSixth after a couple miles they will\nturn onto dirt then it's up St Keens 10\nmi into the race they will reach Carter\nSummit from there it's a speedy downhill\nto turquoise Lake followed by the climb\nup Hagerman pass and\nSugarloaf next up is the downhill on\npower\nline it's a steep and Technical section\nwhere it doesn't take much for things to\ngo\nwrong from there they turn on the\npavement and we'll roll through the\ncheckpoint at pipeline there's a few\nmiles of single track and open road\nbefore they reach twin\nlegs then it's on to the Crux of the\ncourse calling Columbine here Riders\nwill endure 3,000 ft of climbing over\nthe course of 7\nmil once at the top they'll double back\nand get ready to do it all in\nReverse this of course starts with The\nDescent down Coline traveling at very\nhigh speeds in the face of uphill\ntraffic they go back through Twin Lakes\nand back through the flats until they\narrive back at power line a formidable\nAscent at a decisive stage of the race\nthey go down Sugarloaf up to Carter\nSummit down St Kens and after they cross\nthe railroad tracks they'll make a left\nhand turn onto the boulevard a mercilus\nfinal climb known for its rugged\nterrain beyond that lies the home\nstretch where fans will be lined up\nalong Sixth Street waiting for this\nyear's finish to the lifetime Leadville\nTrail 100\nMTB thanks for that Tamara now let's\njump back in with our lead men as they\nare nearing the top of St\nevens our lead men are close to Carter\nSummit it looks like Keegan swensson on\nfront Lin Morton in second wheel John\nGaston third and Toby Road in fourth one\nof the areas I'm thinking I might want\nto pushes up St Kens you know it's early\non the race and it's quite Steep and\nit's never normally the race isn't quite\non there so figured you know could be a\ngood place to go they've disc crested\nCarter Summit dumped out onto the\npavement here it's about a Four Mile\ndescent Keegan in the full aot tuck\nsetting Pace as he tries to break his\nprevious course record as our Chase\ngroup led by Howard grz rolls through\nCarter Summit there's already a 45sec\ngap between them and the\nleaders to be completely honest I\nhaven't had the best lead into this one\nmentally and I I don't know if it's the\npressure of of like being second in the\noverall or what but but on a personal\nlevel like I just really want to prove\nto myself that I can perform well on\nthis course in sort of this modern era\nthey're about to make the left hand turn\nhere onto what we call the Sugarloaf\nclimb here we got a good shot of Lin\nsitting on Keegan's wheel he just looks\nsuper comfortable right now and uh seems\nto be content to let these other guys\nset the pace I think the goal for most\nof us especially the mountain bikers um\nis just to get down to the bottom of the\npower line in one piece\nbasically and we join our Chase group\nlooks to be about 90 seconds back before\nthey make this left hand turn they start\nto climb up to Sugarloaf it is a sign\nific Gap to have at this point in the\nrace whatever group made it down to the\nbottom of power line together you know\nthey're they're going to be all in bin\nsetting the pace of our leading\ngroup of men Toby Reed has fallen off\nthe pace of our Trio Janelle they're\njust about to Crest what we call\nSugarloaf here and they're that's going\nto dump them onto the infamous power\nline\ndescent so as our lead men approach\npower line we're going to take a moment\nto get a little more familiar with the\nlifetime Grand Prix field field and\nspecifically one of the younger Riders\nJack Odin Jack haes from Colorado and a\ncouple weeks ago he made an early trip\nto Leadville to compete in the lifetime\nLeadville stage race we spent some time\nwith Jack to get his take on his second\nyear in the Grand\nPrix my name is Jack Odin um I was born\nand raised in Denver Colorado I I found\nbikes through the Nik High School Race\nLeague got to dig deep today today is\nthe day so get out there and go get them\nand remember if when it gets real tough\nup there and you think about I got to\nslow down a little it's hurting too\nmuch last year was my first year in the\nGrand Prix I was 20 I knew that I was a\nlot younger than all of the guys but\njust wanted to compete with the best in\nthe country remember slowing down\ndoesn't make it hurt less just makes it\nhurt longer we'll see at to finish live\ngo get them\nfamily and it was just a whole lot of\ngetting my teeth kicked in which is it's\nhard sometimes like I I I was trying to\nreframe it and just you know remember\nthat I'm a lot younger than all the guys\nand that um I have a long ways to go but\nit does wear on you throughout the year\nwhen I found out that I got back in this\nyear it was kind of like a oh boy here\nwe go\nagain Leadville always been my race past\ncouple years I've kind of given myself a\npretty rigid like pacing show strategy\njust to make sure I don't blow up in the\nsecond half but this year I kind of just\nwant to go for it and see if I just hang\nwith those front guys how that can\nimpact my time and overall Place coming\nin with a second place finish on the day\nit's Jack Odin dude you were stroking up\nthose climbs I was like if he keeps this\nup beat me by 10 minutes you have to be\nreally confident in your body confident\nmentally to just commit to the effort\nbut that's something I've been working\non look forward to give a\nshot so Jack would fit finish each of\nthe three Leadville stage races in\nsecond place behind Pac we'll see if\nthat extra on course experience pays off\nfor one of the youngest riders in the\nelite men's\nfield now let's jump back out to Kimo\nand Janelle for the men's descent on\nline they just arrived at the top of\npower line this will be a really ripping\ndescent definitely one of the most\ntechnical Rocky sections of the course\nso be interesting to see how those drop\nbars work out for Keegan on this descent\ngoing to happen it's going to happen\ndown this\ndescent you could crash you flat you\ncould you know break a chain or whatever\nit might be so I think you have to be\nlike ready for that to happen and almost\nhave like a contingency plan in\nplace it looks like Lan Morton has had\nto pull over with a flat tire\ndesperately tries to fix this plat Tim\nhow's Lan\nlooking a a very frustrating situation\nto be in here they\ncome Cole Patton has passed Lin Morton\nyou know he's been spending a lot of\ntime in Durango Colorado at altitude to\nclimatize for this race power Line's\nalways a super big risk at the beginning\nof the race there's so many riders\nfighting for position at the beginning\nand it's super high high speed so it's\njust uh being in a safe place towards\nthe front it looks like the dedication\nto Leadville is paying off for Cole\nPaton right now that's a tough break for\nLain and now our lead group has been\nbroken up coming out the bottom it's\nJohn Gaston in the lead Toby Reid is\nbehind him Keegan is now in third and\nCole Patton is in fourth behind Cole is\nour first group of Chasers as they try\nto close some of those gaps let's go\nback and catch up with the women\nand our lead women still a tight\ngroup kot I have to call out our woman\nin the stars and stripes Alexis scarta\nwho is racing today only 5 and a half\nweeks after breaking her collarbone in\ntraining all right here we're looking at\nMelissa Rollins who's go she's really on\ngood form having a great season this\nyear her mom and dad have been big\nLeadville fans have raced here numerous\ntimes I think her mom has a 10-e Buckle\nI think her dad has a 20-year Buckle\nmeans they finished the race more than\n20 times you know Leadville is just one\nof those races where it just has this\nAura and this effect on people that can\nbe difficult to describe Melissa Rollins\ndiscovered Leadville many years ago and\nshe says it changed her life for more on\nthis race and what it means to the\nthousands of people who compete in it\nevery year here's Melissa Rollins\nI'm Alisa Rollins and I actually have a\ninteresting relationship with lville it\nwas the race that got me into\ncycling my junior year of college I sort\nof went through a funk and wanted to\nchange it and happens that my parents\nhad been coming up to this little town\ncalled\nLeadville racing this little race I\nasked them if they thought that would be\nsomething I could do\nand they were super excited and got me\nup to Leadville and I finished my first\nLeadville\n100 it hurts so much in the moment but\nit's one of those things that the after\npart is so worth it that you want to do\nit all over again I think it lit a fire\nin me I came back every year and just\nwanted to get faster and that actually\nended up leading me into a pro\ncontract why do you like leg so much I\nthink a lot of people ask that to my\nparents why are you coming back here for\nthree decades to do the same race a lot\nof it is that feeling you get when you\ncross a Finish Line something about it\nhas this Prestige and it keeps you\ncoming back it's a community and\neverybody's out there cheering\nsupporting it's really cool I've\nactually finished the race with my mom\nhandin hand and separate year with my\ndad handin hand Isn't that cool I mean\nthe\nbike is one thing I did the\nrun I didn't never come back for that\nthe Finish Line was not worth\nit Melissa hasn't gotten all the\nnotoriety of some of the other Elite\nwomen but she has had some great results\nin her career and she's off to a good\nstart today let's go back out to Kemo\nand Janelle as the women are topping out\nat Sugarloaf this is Melisa Rollins on\nthe front followed by Aaron hwk and\nSarah playing in that floral Jersey of\nthe velosio kit we haven't seen Haley\nSmith and Hannah AO like it's hard for\nme to believe actually that Haley Smith\nand Hannah Otto are behind Sarah Lang I\ntend to try and hold on to the front\ngroup of girls pretty heavily at the\nstart and lose positioning at the end\njust because I have burned my matches\nSophia is actually dropped back she just\ngot passed by Michaela Thompson behind\nus\nMelisa leading across the\ntop opening Gap Sarah\nLan I'm really hoping to Pace myself\nrace my own race if it means I'm with\nthe front group then that's great and if\nit means I'm second group then that's\nhow it is Alisa Rollins on the front\ndictating the pace of the Leadville 100\nmy goal is to be top three wheels all\nthe time Hannah Otto someone we've been\nwaiting to see Alexis fla has been\npicked up uh Paige onweller and Crystal\nAnthony I mean to see her put a gap on\nAaron Huck who is just a phenomenal\nmountain biker I think that positioning\non descent is super important\nparticularly on Powerline because it has\na tendency to Thor oxit people and cause\nFlats so if you have a clear line it it\ncan help you you know avoid situations\nlike that\nshe is just ripping this descent today\nover the top of this little kicker out\nof the saddle got a shot of Jack odron\nhere he's walking up this last little\nkicker so we're thinking he's definitely\ngot something mechanical going on with\nhis bike he's pulled over here with the\nkinetic crew uh hoping to get a little\nbit of help here comes\nSophia Sophia making contact with the\nfront of the race so now we have two\nwomen at the front they've cleared the\npower line descend and are on their way\nto the first aid station at Outward\nBound well as our lead women continue on\ntheir way we've had a bit of drama on\nthe men's side it sounds as though Lain\nwasn't the only one who suffered a flat\ntire how long you been riding with a\nflat\nfor all power line no God man I'm sorry\nwe're hearing that Keegan also got a\nflat on his back tire except he didn't\nbother to stop instead he kept riding\nuntil the Outward Bound aid station\nwhere he was able to get it fixed up and\ncontinue his Chase of our leader John\nGaston you know you Fe your Mechanicals\nbut you also fear other people getting\nMechanicals who you kind of need as\nallies after Keegan flatted there on\npower line that put John Gaston off the\nfront all by himself you know one of the\nthings we always say is you don't want\nto ride all away from power line to Twin\nLakes all by yourself he's having to do\nexactly that there are long sections of\nthe course where it really benefits to\nhave um a strong group riding together\ntaking turns at the front can really\nhelp save your legs for the the key\nclimbs Toby Reid he is our first chase\nguy it doesn't always go the way you\nwant and uh we've got about 10 guys in\nthe big chase behind Toby Reed including\nKeegan Russell finsterwald is up there\nMatt beers Howard grz uh Pon made that\ngroup Pac is another one of those\nColorado locals who loves racing at\nLeadville and came out for this year's\nstage race we caught up with him and got\nhis thoughts on his third season in the\nGrand\nPrix one more round of applause today's\nChampion on the men's side pacon\nmckelvin the season so far in this third\nyear of the Grand Prix is finally off to\nGood\nStart first two years I was always\nstarting in a deficit with some pretty\nserious injuries and some elness thrown\nin there too and casing M Elven with a\nphenomenal ride but this year I started\non the front foot for sure and it's\nactually crazy how much that's changed\nthe whole experience so\nfar this wind is tough I think wind\nmight be worse for fishing than\ncycling it's crazy how much the level\ngoes up every year\ngetting on the podium is just that much\nharder and so everyone is working that\nmuch harder to try to get on the podium\nthat arms race of performance can\ngradually consume everything in your\nlife and I've definitely started to fall\ninto that\ntrap every year we make little changes\npay attention to the details a little\nbit more commit a little more to\ntraining camps live a little bit more of\na pure athlete\nlifestyle it's easy to make everything\nabout going faster on a bike doing this\nsort of thing now and then will make you\nfaster also I think my coach would be\nstoked if I told him I was fishing right\nnow this Grand Prix environment is just\ngetting the best out of me I think as an\nathlete the previous course record was\nbeaten by two full minutes here today\ntoo much welcome for Mr K\nMelvin I don't necessarily have like the\nhighest threshold power of some of the\nother guys out there or anything like\nthat but a lot of these races are are\njust survival\ncompetitions this is the part where we\nprepare for top of\nColine usually I can hang in there\npretty well and yeah I'm just really\nenjoying it and it's very\nmotivating as our men enter the Twin\nLakes checkpoint John Gaston is still\nout front but things have shaken up a\nbit with our Chasers four Riders managed\nto separate from the big group and\nwisely Toby Reid chose to absorb into\nthat group making it five let's see\nwhere things stand at the Twin Lakes\ncheckpoint with our leaderboard\nS so out front is Gaston and then your\nChase group of five including Toby finy\nKeegan Cole and\nHoward and then there's a larger group\nincluding pacon Pete STNA Matt beers and\nBrendan Johnson amongst others that is\nonly 30 seconds or so behind them so\nreally it's still anyone's race and with\nColine looming there will be plenty of\nchances for stronger legs to\nPrevail last year this is where Keegan\nmade his move and broke away from Alexi\nand the rest of the field from there no\none would come close to catching him as\nhe would go on to shatter the Leadville\ncourse record now the question is can he\ndo it again let's kick it out to Kimo\nand Janelle to find\nout Keegan dictates the\nrace he's an incredible athlete across\nthe board we all have to respect that I\ndon't know how he'll play it differently\nbecause I feel like he puts so much work\ninto last year so much homework to nail\nthat record that I think this year the\nreal Ace up the sleeve is just the\ndifferent bike setup which in theory\nthere's a bunch of free time there word\nfrom the field is that Keegan has now\ncaught John and is leading our men's\nfield up\nColine as you climb up in elevation you\nget above 12,000 ft that's when the\nwheels can really fall off and so um\nideally having enough matches for the\ntop of that climb and and riding good\npower up there that's going to make the\ndifference so Janelle we're up here on\nthe top of the infamous Coline climb\nabout to hit the turnaround point of the\nlifetime Leadville Trail 100 presented\nby connetic and we caught up with our\nleader once again no surprises Keegan\nswon off the front he's caught John\nGaston and uh he's probably got three or\nfour minutes minutes of Separation\nalready here he knows that he's lost\ntime because of his mechanical every\nsecond that he can gain is going to\ncount as he crests this monster of a\nColine clim would you believe he is\nwithin 1 minute of the same Pace he did\nlast year when he set the record here at\nthe top of the cine\nclimb last year I think Keegan clocked\nover 50 m an hour power on the Coline\ndescent let's see what he can do on his\ndrop bar setup\ntoday he's about to pass John Gaston who\nis still probably three or four minutes\nfrom the top here he's about to pass\nCole Patton on his way\ndown he's got we're going to get a Time\nsplit here but he's probably got a four\nto five minute Gap right now Coline\ndescent's definitely a place where you\ncan push it John Gaston rounded the\nturnaround and started The Descent he is\nexactly 4 minutes and 50 seconds behind\nour leader Keegan Swenson if you have a\ngap at the top you can really\nconsolidate that time getting a look at\nmckelvin here as he and Lin Morton start\nthe most technical section on the Coline\ndescent you can see mckelvin making a\nconcerted effort to relax recover and\nprepare for the remaining miles back\ntowards\ntown going into Twin Lakes Keegan had a\none minute deficit to John Gaston coming\nout the bottom it's a 6-minute\nAdvantage if history serves as any kind\nof indicator I doubt anyone has catching\nKeegan\nswensson now let's turn our attention\nback to the women they have also cleared\nthe Twin Lakes checkpoint let's take a\nlook at the leaderboard presented by\nsbl so after a little bit of Separation\ncoming down power line we have a lead\ngroup of three women including Michaela\nThompson Sophia and Melissa\nRollins there's two Chasers behind them\nEllen Campbell and Deanna Maes and then\nsix s minutes off the lead you got some\nof the big names like Hannah utto Alexis\nscarta and Sarah Sturm you know with\nDean in that fifth spot three of the top\nfive women were here to compete in the\nLeadville stage race a couple weeks\nago this race covers the entire\nLeadville 100 course but it's broken up\nover the course of three days Ellen won\nthe first stage Melissa won the third\nstage and the overall and the second\nstage Coline Deanna males won as our\nwomen's field approaches Coline now\nlet's take a moment to get to know\nDeanna a little better and see if she\ncan have a repeat effort on the course's\ntoughest\nsection oh my God so impressive thank\nyou so impressive I impressed myself\nyou're amazing I'm Deana man originally\nfrom Ohio and currently living in\nColorado Springs you did it oh my God\nnice job I'm an engineer at Ram Rock\nshocks and got into racing about\n2022 it is really difficult to be racing\nat this level and hold a full-time gig\nbut it is just nice having the support\nfrom Sand seeing one of their own\nthat product give yourselves a round of\napplause for a phenomenal day stage\nnumber two last year I was a little bit\nscared of Leadville just the altitude\nand and being out there so long welcome\ndi mails to the front of the podium here\nI had a a strategy of even pacing so\nwhen it was one of the fastest race\nstarts in history I kind of let the\nfield go the a great rid a pretty\ndominating performance out there today\nbut I think that never put me into the\nrace and I think this year a change to\nmy strategy would be always being there\nat the front whatever that that means in\norder to perform and have a better\nresult and let's jump up to our group of\nthree lead women now as they start up\nColine\nI mean I know this course really well\nI've climbed these climbs slow I've\nclimbed these climbs in the stage race\nI've climbed these climbs in the ladel\n100 on tired legs I know how long these\nclimbs take I think knowing that can\nhelp if you're kind of like needing to\ncalculate how much time you can\nbleed when things aren't going well we\nhave rejoined our lead women on the\nColine climb Melisa Rollins a solid lead\nover her two Breakaway\ncompanions Sophia Gomez Nisha fa\ncurrently in second followed closely by\nmaybe 10 seconds Michaela\nThompson when I think back to last year\non Columbine it felt like it took\nforever to get that climb so going into\nthis year I'm really that you know I can\njust have something at least to make it\nup it right at what we call the Goat\nTrail this is one of the toughest parts\nof the course it looks like Mela might\nbe working her way back up to Sophia's\nwheel here on the climb the mental and\nemotional side of racing is 90% of it\nSophia looked over her right hand\nshoulder and as soon as she did she went\nup to the left hand side of that road\nalmost taking herself out I think you're\nright chemo she's starting to look more\nlabored than we're used to seeing Sophia\nsay I'm at the top of Coline where it\nopens up and you can see the road like\nbasically to the Finish if I can see one\nof the girls in front of me it'll just\nautomatically make me like it moves you\nforward Michaela Thompson out of the\nsaddle and riding confidently away as\nSophia reaches into her back pocket if\nshe's grabbing a gel this is always a\nsign that a rider is starting to\nstruggle it seems like altitude people's\nstomachs don't tolerate as much fuel so\nit's pretty easy to get behind here I\nmean you can't hide at 12,000 ft already\nlooks like she's put in close to a 20\nsecond Gap with not as labored she a\nreally smooth pedal stroke body's not\nweaving Alisa Rollins she looks so\nsmooth got a good Cadence going looking\nreally comfortable she is picking off\nthese Elite men right and left she has\nreally put a clinic on on this climb and\nput a sizable Gap into Sophia and\nMichaela from the top of Coline it's\nMelisa Rollins out front with a\nthree-minute gap over Michaela Thompson\nin second Sophia is about 90 seconds off\nMichaela and Sarah Lang a couple minutes\nbehind her as the elite women make the\nturn and begin The Descent such an\nimpressive ride that we're witnessing\nfrom Elisa Rollins and you know what\nshe's going to get a glance at her\ncompetitors as she descend s and look at\nthis she's passing Michaela\nThompson yeah it can definitely take the\nthe wind out of your sales a little bit\nand your heart can sink a little bit\nwhen someone goes flying by you on The\nDescent after you work so hard on the\nclimb so for the women the question will\nbe who can hold on in the second half of\nthe race Melissa is looking strong but\nSophia is as Fierce of a competitor as\nthere is we'll check back with them soon\nfor the Finish to their race but now\nit's time to check in on the men as they\nhave cleared the outward-bound\ncheckpoint and are headed towards power\nline here's your leaderboard presented\nsbl so with a 9-minute gap Keegan is\njust adding to his lead at this point\nbut there's a tight race for second to\ndeveloping with John Gaston and Cole\nPatton behind them Toby Reid Lin pacon\nhave emerged as your second Chase group\nHoward grz Russell finsterwald and Matt\nbeers are about three minutes behind\nthose guys in a Chase group of six so if\nnothing crazy happens we expect Keegan\nto take his fourth Leadville 100 victory\nin a row but the battle for the\nremaining Podium spots is up in the air\ndoing a little fly by the Outward Bound\na station looking down at our good\nfriends from Good Life Brands they have\nbeen a great partner for us across the\nlifetime Grand Prix presented by Mazda\nthis year all right let's go out to\npower line for the conclusion of the\nmen's\nrace I like to think of Leadville as the\nrace starts at power line going\nup the beginning of the climb is the\nsteepest part so ideally that's where\nyou want to go the hardest on the\nsteepest\ngrade Janelle Keegan's grinding up this\nfirst part this power line climb he has\nreally got a good Cadence going I'll\ntell you 98% of the Riders out here are\ngoing to walk this today near the top of\npower line Keegan Swenson Riding Solo he\nis long\ngone but you still have a lot of stair\nsteps left after that 25% grade climb we\nhave rejoined our first chase this is\nJohn Gaston and Cole Patton John in a\nsimilar position as he's been in the\npast two years vying for the second and\nthird spot on the\npodium the depth the field we get to\nrace at leville these days is crazy\nthere's the guys that I get to race week\nin and week out and we have a couple\nfolks who just sort of celeb shot style\ndrop in for just Leadville like John\nGaston and just do incredible rides Co\nCole's moving around to the front here\nJanelle he uh got tired of sitting on\nJon's wheel I think you can probably\nsense that Jon is working pretty hard\nthe speeds are only getting faster\neveryone's only getting fitter and\nthey're training harder and harder every\nyear so you have to figure out a way to\nto keep up I can't not go when someone\nattacks if I have the\nlegs I will try and that has come back\nto bite me more than a few times but\nit's also part of what makes this sport\nso fun John Gaston Cole Patton those two\nRiders duking it out when you're on the\nfront feeling good you can hear the\nRiders breathing behind you you can tell\nif they're feeling more labored if\nthey're starting to struggle but you\nknow John and Cole right now they look\nto be pretty evenly matched so as Cole\nand John continue to battle for second\nKeegan is making his way towards the\nFinish you know Janelle you can only\nspeculate but uh you got to wonder if he\nhad not flatted on power line if he\nwould have been able to break that\nrecord\ntoday this will be his fourth year\nwinning the lifetime Leadville Trail 100\nthe only other athlete to do that\nactually Dave WS won it six times in a\nrow so Keegan's well on his way entally\nbeating Dave W's record\n[Applause]\nsomeday high fives breaking that 6h hour\nmark on the drop bar setup Keegan\nSwenson coming in for the\nwin Ms he's about 3 or 4 minutes off his\nPace from last year but still just an\namazing performance to come in and win\nthis us again for the fourth year in a\nrow Keegan Swenson your 2024 lifetime\nBeville Trail 100 presented by kinetic\nChampion while we were watching Keegan's\nfinish word on the street is that John\nGaston was able to pull away from Cole\nwhen they were going down Sugarloaf and\nthey are now minutes from the finish at\nhis third place Cole Patton Riding\nSolo looks like John Gaston was able to\nGap him over the top of power line and\nand has been able to keep pouring on\nthat\ngas Cole Patton sitting in third place\nabout to take a left hand turn onto the\nboulevard sometimes you just got to\nthrow in the attacks and I think the\nmost important thing is to just commit\nbecause there's if you if you spend the\nnext few hours second guessing yourself\nit's just it's going to be bad it's\ngoing to end bad your legs are going to\nfall off and it it can be super easy to\nwant to give up sometimes and just throw\nin the towel but you just got to keep\nremembering that you know this is like\nwhat I'm here for this is what I chose\nto do here he is riding solo for much of\nthis final half of the race John Gaston\ncoming in for second place in the\n100 so Janelle we're here here we've got\nCole Patton coming up Sixth Street he\ncan see the red carpet in the finish\nline right now he's rolling in for third\njust under six hours and seven minutes\nfor third place so there you have your\none two three for the men last we saw\npacon and Lin were together battling for\nfourth and here they come now Sprint for\nfourth place M and Lin going to the line\nP was so strong today but llin showing\nthat he had a little bit more left in\ntank llin coming back from that earlier\nflat pace and strong ride all day long\nit's going to be really key for the\npoints\nthat was another fantastic race here in\nthe lifetime Grand Prix presented by\nMazda and with that it's time to check\nout the men's final leaderboard\nsbl so Keegan wins his fourth in a row\nJohn takes second Cole third Lin fourth\nand pacon fifth behind them it's finy\nbeers Toby Alex wild and Z Calton in\nspots 6 to 10\nrespectively and with the men's race all\nwrapped up we now turn our attention\ntowards the women for their\nfinish at the last checkpoint at\noutbound it was still Melissa Rollins\nwith a big lead over the rest of the\nfield Michaela is still out in front of\nSophia with a three-minute gap Sarah\nLang is in fourth and Ellen Campbell in\nfifth about four minutes behind Sophia\nwe have a Chase group of three with\nSarah Lang Ellen Campbell and Dean\nmales all right it's now time for Kimo\nand Janelle to bring us\nhome it seems like Melisa has been\nknocking on the door of a breakout ride\nat Leadville for a number of years she's\nhad three top 10 finishes in the past\nand it was just a matter of time until\nshe became one of the top\ncontenders catching up with second place\nin the women's Pro field Michaela\nThompson michaa was sitting about 6\nminutes of 20 20 seconds off of the pace\nof Melisa\nRollins sopia go Gomez V shaf she's got\nherself a couple guys she's picked up\nalong the way looking up ahead to see if\nshe can catch a glimpse of Michaela\nThompson it's hard to tell on this part\nof the course how she might be feeling I\nmean really on power line is going to be\nwhere we see how well she's recovered\nfrom the effort so far\ntoday and our Chase\nwe've got Ellen Campbell Deanna males\nand Sarah\nL they've got about three minutes\nbetween them and third place but you\nknow as we've said multiple times today\nanything can happen on power\nline being chased for me is harder\nbecause it kind of gets in my head so\nthen I'm of course trying to speed up\nbut I'm hurting you're running out of\nmatches from such a long day Michaela\nThompson who was seven 10 minutes behind\nour leader Melisa Rollins at the bottom\nof power line saw her look over her\nshoulder just a minute ago and\nunfortunately it means that she's\nthinking about someone chasing from\nbehind Kemo this just goes to show how\nin a race of this length at this\naltitude with so much climbing that\nthings can change so quickly Ken Clover\nwould say this is the time of the day\nyou got to dig deep Michaela turning off\nthe pavement to Carter SU met and about\na minute and a half behind last year's\nwinner Sophia Gomez\nvisha think she was about 4 minutes down\nat the bottom of power line so she's\nclawed back over 3 minutes on Michaela\nwe know she's strong at the end we saw\nher last year leading the\nrace Ruth Edwards clawed back from a\npretty significant deficit got within 20\nseconds of her at the bottom of the\nboulevard as soon as Sophia looked back\nand saw that she put down the Gas Pedal\nand she ended up putting two minutes\ninto her in that last three miles of the\nLeadville Trail\n100 it could be a fight for second\nplace we just popped out of the trees\nhere at the bottom of the St kev's\ndescent Melissa Rollins looks\ncomfortable last check she had about a f\nminute\nGap what a strong ride by Melisa\nRollins every day that I've trained this\nyear I've thought about Leadville\nwinning would be absolutely everything I\ndon't think I could even describe\nit where's the next\nperson oh my\nGod you know her legs are screaming at\nher but at this point you don't feel\nit bisa Rollins is your 202 for Lifetime\n100 presented by kinetic\nChampion Michaela Thompson has descended\noff of St Ken still riding solo and she\nstill has her gap on Chaser sopia Gomez\nvishaan but Kimo it looks like it is\ngoing to be a nailbiter of the finish\nfor second place she's working with two\nguys here trying to track down Michaela\nMichaela is all alone she doesn't have\nanybody in sight in front of\nher and the catch has been made Sophia\nGomez Vish coming by Michaela Thompson\nas Michaela looks over her shoulder and\ntries to jump onto the back of this\ngroup I'm guessing that when they make\nthis left- hand turn on the bottom of\nthe boulevard she is probably going to\nstomp on the gas pedal just like she did\nhere last\nyear Kemo look at that Gap open up\nSophia knows what she's doing she's\nexperienced on this course she knows\nit's a great place to put in a little\ndig and and here she goes she's pulling\naway Gomez V\nchaan looking to finish second in the\n2024 lifetime Leadville 100 and Michaela\nThompson an enormous fight for third\nplace and former Olympian Aaron Huck\novercomes a mechanical to finish in\nfourth place and with that let's look at\nthe women's final leader board presented\nby sbl\nMelissa Sophia and Michaela are on the\npodium Aaron fourth Sarah Lang came in\nfifth Ellen Campbell had a really nice\nride and finished in sixth then Deanna\nHannah Crystal Anthony and Haley Smith\nround out the top 10\nI was really afraid of blowing up I was\nreally afraid of cramping and I did but\nit's okay we made it\nthrough we made it your winner here\nmeisa\nRollins start to I get the win here and\nyou know kind of add lead a little bit\ngoing to the next few rounds cuz those\nother ones are uh you know a little more\nwide open racing a little more tactical\nlittle faster just want to yeah nice get\nit done so now we have three races\ncompleted in the lifetime Grand Prix\npresent Ed by Mazda and for your overall\nstandings in the Grand Prix here's the\nleaderboard presented by\nsbl Keegan and pacon hang on to first\nand second place but now Lin has taken\nover that third spot Matt beers bumps\ndown from third to Fourth and Toby Reid\nrounds out your top\nfive on the women's side Sophia Rises to\nthe top spot knocking Haley Smith to\nSecond Hannah Auto bumps down from\nsecond to third Alexis hangs on to\nFourth and Sarah Sturm moves up to fifth\nand after her ride today Melissa jumps\nall the way from 20th up to\n8th so that's where we're at the\nlifetime Grand Prix season is in its\ndownswing and these athletes motivations\nare going to start to shift who's\nhunting and who's the hunted we'll find\nout on our next stop at Schwan on\nSeptember 14th here's Kimo Seymour with\na closer look at what awaits Us in\nNorthern wiscons\nthe Leadville Trail 100 MTB is\nofficially in the books and the lifetime\nGrand Prix presented by Mazda has\nreached the halfway\npoint at this point in the season we\nshould have four races\ncompleted however things happened\noutside of our\ncontrol leaving us with no choice but to\ncancel Crusher in the\ntusher so here we are three races down\nthree to go\nfor the next race we're headed to\nWisconsin for the schaman mountain bike\nFestival 40 Mi of winding Forest Trails\nawait our field of\ncompetitors this race is not like the\nothers it's shorter faster\npunchier and if it rains it's going to\nbe\nmuddy schaman is a different\nBeast it'll take a different kind of\nRider to tame it expect to see the\nunexpected oh my God and watch the\noverall round in tensions will rise\nas our athletes have only three\nopportunities remaining to VI for a top\nspot in the 2024 lifetime Grand Prix\nMazda that's it for us here in Leadville\non behalf of Kimo and Janelle in the\nheli Tim and Lauren on the ground and\nour entire cold collaborative production\nteam I'm Bill Ellison saying thank you\nfor tuning in and we hope to

          "transcript": "As I made the turnaround at the top of\nColine, something happened that has\nnever happened in my life before.\nWelcome back to the channel. This video\nis fueled by the feed. So, I'm just\ngoing to warn you right off the bat.\nThis is going to be a little different\nthan a typical Dylan Johnson race report\nvideo. Yes, there will still be tech\ntalk, power numbers, and marginal gains,\nbut there's also going to be a lot more\num feelings and introspection than\nyou're used to on this channel. And\nthat's because this was my first race\nback after being hit by a truck on a\ntraining ride this May. I'm not going to\nget too much into my build back from\ninjury in this video, but I will\nprobably save that for a future video\nwhen I'm actually fully healed and back\nto full fitness. But for the purposes of\nthis video, this is what you need to\nknow. Roughly 3 months before race day\nat Leadville, I was hit by a truck. This\nwas particularly cruel timing because it\nwas just 2 weeks out from the most\nimportant race of the year for me, which\nis the Unbound 200. The result was a\nfractured tibial plateau and fibula in\nmy right leg. For those of you who\ndidn't know about the accident, who were\nquestioning why you never saw an Unbound\nvideo, this is the reason. I spent the\nday of Unbound on the couch instead of\nat the race. 1 month after the accident,\nI was able to pedal a bike for the first\ntime, albeit very easy and for a very\nshort amount of time. And then 2 months\nafter the accident, I was able to train\nwithout pain or excessive swelling in my\nknee, which left me about a month of\ntraining before Leadville. By race day,\nthe bone was pretty much healed and I\nonly had minor swelling. I could go into\na lot more detail and like I said, I\nprobably will in the future, but the\npoint I'm trying to get at is that I was\nnot in good shape for this race. This is\nnot an excuse I ever like to use. In\nfact, I don't think I have ever once in\nmy life said I'm not in shape on the\nstarting line of a bike race. I pride\nmyself on being wellprepared for bike\nraces, which is probably apparent if you\nwatch this channel by how much thought I\nput into the equipment for these various\nraces. But I would say that applies\nequally, if not more so, to my physical\nconditioning. I simply don't show up to\nraces wishing I had trained more. In\nfact, if anything, sometimes I show up\nto races having trained too much. But\nthat's besides the point. It just turns\nout that this time around I didn't have\na choice. Okay, settle down there,\nbuddy. You're not better than the rest\nof us just because you trained your ass\noff just to get 17th again. You may be\nasking, Dylan, why not just wait until\nyou're actually fully healed and back in\ngood shape to start racing again? And\nnormally I would, but it is still a goal\nof mine to finish the Lifetime Grand\nPrix this year, even if my chances of a\nhigh placing are completely shot at this\npoint. My chances of making it back into\nthe Grand Prix next year are almost\ncertainly in jeopardy right now, and\nquitting the series at this point\nbecause I won't place well will\ndefinitely not help. Seeing as you only\nget one drop race for the season and I\nwas forced to miss Unbound, Leadville\nwas a must. I'm going to guess that if\nyou're watching this video, you have\nsome idea of what Leadville is. But just\nin case you've been living under a rock\nor you know you have a life and you\ndon't follow American gravel racing,\nwhich is much more likely, here's a\nbrief overview. Leadville is a 100mile\nmountain bike race. And I use the term\nmountain bike loosely here because it's\nmore of a dirt road race done on\nmountain bikes at an altitude of 3200 to\n3,800 m or 10,000 to 12,000 ft. The\naltitude is what makes Leadville iconic.\nIt is extremely hard to perform well\nthis high up with massive drops in power\nand it presents all kinds of new\nproblems that might be different than\nwhat you're used to at sea level like\nacclamation, pacing, and race nutrition.\nAnd if that didn't make Leadville enough\nof a puzzle, then you have the bike\nsetup problem. And if you've watched any\nof my Leadville videos in the past, you\nhave heard my rant on this already.\nLeadville is considered a mountain bike\nrace because at the time it was started,\ngravel bikes wouldn't exist for another\n15 years. In reality, Leadville is not\nquite mountain bike terrain with mostly\nwide double track and gravel roads. But\nthere are also too many rough sections\nto make a normal gravel bike the right\ncall. For this reason, two years ago, I\ndid something radical here. I put drop\nhandlebars on my mountain bike, not to\nbe different or to have something to\ntalk about on my YouTube channel, as\nmany of my fellow racers assumed, but to\nactually attempt to go faster, bro. Give\nme a break. This is literally your fifth\nvideo talking about drop bar mountain\nbikes. That's more than GCN and Alexi\nVermuan combined. Now, I was not the\nfirst rider to ride drop bars at\nLeadville. Writers like Travis Brown and\nCory Wallace had tried it, but it never\nwent mainstream. Not even close. But\nstill, to me, it made a lot of sense. I\ndidn't just make this decision\nhalfhazardly, either. I tried it on\nevery section of the course and even did\ncalculations to take into account the\narrow savings at altitude and came up\nwith a 6inut savings for the entire\ncourse. And in 2023, the first year that\nI used the drop bars here, I did go\nfaster by about 20 minutes over the\nprevious year. Of course, I was also\nfitter and the conditions were perfect,\nso it's hard to say how much the bars\nhelped. The following year, which would\nhave been last year, the winner of the\nrace, Keegan Swinson, and also Russell\nFinsterwald, also put drop bars on their\nmountain bike. Now, I made a big deal\nabout the watt savings and the time\nsavings from running the drop bars here,\nbut for most people, that doesn't mean a\nwhole lot. They just care about what the\nwinner of the race is doing because\nwhatever the winner did must be the\nfastest. It's not logical, especially in\nthis scenario because Keegan Swenson is\nso dominant that he could probably win\non a tricycle, but it's just the way the\nworld works. When I saw that Keegan had\nembraced drop bars, I knew that\neverything would change at Leadville.\nAnd sure enough, this year, probably\nhalf the pro field in both the men's and\nwomen's race were on drop bars. Yep,\nLeadville has officially become the\nunholy burial ground for the traditional\nmountain bike, and I couldn't be happier\nabout it. But on top of this, the fact\nthat so many pros went to drop bars and\nthere are still holdouts on traditional\nflap bars meant that we kind of have a\nlittle bit of a natural experiment on\nour hands. If drop bars are in fact\nfaster by roughly 6 minutes, then riders\nwho choose drop bars should on average\ngo faster this year compared to the\nprevious year, especially compared with\ntheir flat bar counterparts. Stick\naround to the end of the video because I\nam going to be comparing last year's\ntimes to this year's times for the flat\nbar and drop bar riders to try to see if\ndrop bars were actually an advantage and\ncome up with a winner for this flat bar\nversus drop bar debate at Leadville, at\nleast this year for the riders that\nchose it under these conditions. But\nstill, hopefully it'll be enough to get\nthe internet trolls all riled up. Don't\ntake the bait. If we all just comment\nboring under this video, then maybe\nhe'll finally stop talking about this.\nLet's get to how the race actually\nplayed out, though, because I suppose\nthis is still a race report video, and I\nshouldn't get too sidetracked with my\nown soap boxes and high horses. Now,\neven when I'm in my best shape, pacing\nat Leadville is critical. Blowing up\ncatastrophically is extremely common at\naltitude and your ability to recover\nfrom hard efforts is compromised. I\nnormally set a power and or heart rate\ntarget and stick to it religiously\ndespite what everyone is doing around\nme. And in the past, this has resulted\nin me being behind at the top of the\nfirst climb and then catching riders as\nthey blow up throughout the race. This\nyear, my strategy was no different. In\nfact, I would argue that it only makes\nmore sense to follow a rigid pacing\nstrategy when you're not in your best\nshape. Given my lack of volume over the\nlast month, I was very worried about\nblowing up. So, I did keep it pretty\nconservative. I settled on trying to\nhold 270 watts up the climbs, which is a\nsea level equivalent of 340 watts. Yes,\nriding at this altitude does make that\nbig of a difference to your power. And\nyes, using the sea level equivalent when\ntalking about your Leadville power does\nmake you seem much more impressive and\nis better on the ego. Last year, the\nnumber that I chose for the clims was\n300 watts, but there was no way that I\nwas holding that in my current form. And\nto be honest, last year this number was\nprobably too high for me as well.\nSticking to a conservative number like\nthis, of course, means that you get\ndropped almost immediately on the first\nclimb because people are terrible about\npacing themselves for a long bike race.\nAnd I am not immune to this. I have\ncracked two out of the three times that\nI've done Leadville. This meant that I\nwas cresting the first climb after doing\n273 watts average for a little over 23\nminutes up it in 51st place out of 65\nriders in the men's pro field. Look, I\nknow that even despite getting hit by a\ntruck, this back of the pack Leadville\nstory seems a little bit desperate right\nnow, and you're totally justified in\nwondering why I even bothered making a\nYouTube video about this race at this\npoint. Yeah, we were all thinking it for\npretty much all your race videos,\nactually. But I was starting to pick\nriders off after the first climb with\nanother 23minute effort at 280 watts to\nthe top of the second climb. And then by\nthe time I got to the bottom of the\npowerline descent at 25 mi in, I had\nmoved up to 43rd place. Unfortunately,\nas I hit this flat section on the course\nwhere drafting matters a lot, I caught\nCanadian hitter from the Poutine Mafia,\nAlexi Cartier, who was actually on a\ngravel bike. Again, this is a bad idea.\nThere's a reason why I caught him at the\nbottom of the descent. That being said,\nit was a good bike for this particular\nsection of the course. And to be honest,\nI let him do most of the polling here,\naveraging just 210 watts for over an\nhour before hitting the bottom of the\nlongest climb of the day and the halfway\npoint of the race, Coline. Going up\nColine, I actually flipped my Wahoo to\nthe maps page so that I couldn't look at\nmy power and I more so just try to ride\nat a pace that felt manageable and that\nkept my breathing under control. This\nisn't something that I would normally\ndo, but pacing really matters for the\nfirst two climbs, and then for the\nremainder of the race, I was just\nfocused on not blowing up. Going up\nColine, I managed 254 watts for a little\nover an hour, which, as I'm obligated to\nremind you, is a sea level equivalent of\nnearly 320 watts. And I was catching\nriders as I climbed, which boosted my\nspirits immensely. By the time I got to\nthe top, I was now up to 33rd place.\nOkay. Um, I don't know how to talk about\nthis. This is very new and uncharted\nterritory for me on this channel, but\nwe're going to attempt to talk about\nemotions and feelings here for a minute.\nUh, let's see how it goes. At the top of\nColumbine, you come out of the trees\nonto this open field at the top of a\nmountain that you just spent an hour\nclimbing. And it may just be the most\nbeautiful scenery that I or most people\nwill race a bike in, period. It's hard\nto enjoy it because you can hardly\nbreathe and obviously you aren't\nstopping to take in the view or take a\npicture mid race. But even in this\nhypoxic state, it is a sight to behold.\nnever happened in my life before. I\nstarted getting choked up and tears\nstarted welling up in my eyes. Not from\nsadness or pain, but from happiness. At\nleast I thought that's what it was. But\nI'll get to that in a minute. I quickly\ngathered myself because I had a long\ndescent in front of me and over 50 miles\nleft to race. But this caught me\ncompletely off guard. I have never cried\ntears of joy in my life before. But then\nagain, I've never been married and I\ndon't have any children, so maybe I just\nhaven't experienced the most joyful\nparts of life yet. But I digress. Now, I\ncould talk about my power numbers for\nthe rest of the race, but quite frankly,\nwho cares? I didn't even look at my\npower for the rest of the race. I just\nkept it on my map screen and pretty much\nrode on pure emotion. At the bottom of\nColine, I caught an old college racing\nbuddy of mine, Elliot Bearing. And\nagain, I was okay to let him do most of\nthe work on the flats as I knew the\nchances of blowing up on the power line\nclimb were high. He was happy to do\nabout 80% of the work. And even though I\ncould have gone harder here, my plan was\nto get to power line and then at that\npoint I could throw caution to the wind\nand go all out to the finish. Again, two\nout of the three times that I have done\nLeadville, I have cracked on Power Line.\nSo, this climb has nothing but respect\nfrom me. Going up power line, Elliot got\na small gap on me, but I kept him within\nsight, and by the bottom of the descent\noff of power line, I had caught him\nagain. And we were working together to\ncatch riders. In this late stage of the\nrace, for the first time all day, I\nfound myself within the top 30 and\ncatching riders by the minute. And every\nrider that I caught felt like a\nreassurance and was a massive boost to\nmy confidence. On the final false flat\nstretch, I felt those emotions bubbling\nup again. After all was said and done,\nthis was actually going to end up being\na pretty decent lead bill. And I didn't\nexpect that at all. In fact, if you had\nasked me how the race would go 3 days\nearlier after I had done a pre-ride, I\nprobably would have said it was going to\nbe a rough day and I would have been an\nhour back from what I was. By the time I\nhit the finishing straight, I found\nmyself coming to the line solo in 27th\nplace in a time of 6 hours 49 minutes\nand 18 seconds. And out of the Lifetime\nGrand Prix riders, yes, the eternal\ncurse continues just like nothing ever\nhappened with a 17th place. While this\nmay not seem like much, this result was\nonly six places off my finish from last\nyear and only 20 minutes off of last\nyear's time and 25 minutes off of my\nbest. Again, I didn't expect a lot going\ninto this race, but I far exceeded those\nexpectations, but what happened next was\nprobably the least expected at the\nfinish line. those tears that I was\nholding back at the top of Coline and\nthroughout the second half of the race.\nYeah, I I couldn't hold them back\nanymore. I held it together for probably\n5 minutes to say congrats to some of my\nfellow racers who were at the finish\nline and then I saw Trava Anno who works\nfor Lifetime. She asked me how my race\nwent and I just immediately started\nballing my eyes out in front of her. I\ndon't even know her very well, but maybe\nit was just the fact that it was a woman\ninstead of one of my male racing peers\nthat I have this need to appear tough\nand strong around. I don't know. And for\nbetter or worse, the feed got footage of\nit. So, here you go. You've been warned.\nI I've never I've never cried after a\nrace like this. I think sometimes people\njust um you know they don't take into\naccount like the emotional part of\ngetting injured like that. Um I just\nyou know when after I got hit uh you not\nonly did I not ride a bike for a month\nwhich is the longest I've ever not\nridden a bike in my life but I couldn't\neven walk. Like all all I did was sit on\na couch and like my couch has like a\npermanent dent in it from where I just\nsat there for a month.\nCongrats.\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\n&gt;&gt; Did it like you're you're going to be\nokay.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Oh, dude.\nDude, I I just got some gravel dust in\nmy eye, man. It's I swear I just Who\nWho's chopping onions in here? If the\ntop of Combine was the first tear of joy\nthat I ever shed in my life, then the\nfinish line of Leadville was the first\ntime that I legitimately cried from\nhappiness. At least that's what I\nthought in the moment. I've had some\ntime to reflect on what I was feeling,\nand I actually do think that it was\ntrauma from the accident resurfacing.\nLast year, I had a close friend of mine\ndie after being hit by a car on a bike\nride. And this year, two local riders to\nwestern North Carolina, where I'm from,\nwere hit and killed on a group ride. One\nof the riders who narrowly escaped with\nhis life, is a friend of mine, and we\nwent to see him the day after the\naccident. And I don't know if I've ever\nseen somebody in a worse mental state.\nAnd while my accident wasn't nearly as\nserious, I still think about it all the\ntime. I still train on the road,\nobviously, because it's my job, and more\nimportantly, it's what I love to do, but\nI still have PTSD every time a truck\npasses me too closely. After I got hit,\nI spent a month doing nothing but\nsitting on a couch. I couldn't walk. I\ncouldn't exercise. I couldn't even drive\na car. When you're used to riding a bike\n20 to 30 hours a week, this kind of\nshift is hard mentally to say the least.\nThe day of Unbound was probably the\nhardest day of the entire recovery\nprocess. I put on a good face when I\npopped onto the live stream to give my\ncommentary for about 5 minutes. But\ntruth be told, I didn't even want to\nwatch it. But I also put it into\nperspective. In the grand scheme of\nthings, sitting on the couch for a month\nand not being as fit as I'd like to be\nfor the races that I have this season is\nnot the end of the world. A lot of\nriders were not as lucky as I was. I've\npersonally known riders that weren't as\nlucky as I was. When I think back on it,\nI think what I was really feeling at the\nend of Leadville was relief. Relief that\nI was able to race again, but more than\nthat, just relief that I was okay and\nthat I was one of the lucky ones.\nOkay. Well, turns out that Dylan Johnson\nis a human after all and not just a\nrobot that spits out research articles\non creatine and watt losses from running\ntires that are too narrow. Who would\nhave thought? This seems like a bit of a\nweird transition, but for those who are\ncurious, my NP for the whole race was\n243 and my average power was 212, which\nis a sea level equivalent of 306 and\n265, respectively. And this is about 20\nwatts lower than last year. I am\ngenuinely proud of this effort given\neverything that I went through this\nsummer. But this race was about more\nthan power or heart rate or even\ntactics. It was about proving that I\ncould race again even if I'm not quite\nas fit as I used to be just yet. Uh and\nif I'm being honest, overanalyzing the\npower numbers from this race seems a\nlittle bit inappropriate at this stage\nof my recovery process. That being said,\nwhat is appropriate and also extremely\nrelevant is me saying I told you so. Let\nme explain. I am of course referring to\ndrop our mountain bikes. Two years ago\nwhen I first did a drop our mountain\nbike at Leadville, there were a lot of\nskeptics and many of my fellow pros were\namong them.\nAlexi Vermuan. Oh, I'm sorry. I was just\nclearing my throat there. Sure, I ended\nup going faster, but I'm just one rider.\nThe next year, Keegan ended up going\nslower with the drop bars. And this\nyear, he still hasn't beaten his fastest\ntime, which was set with the flat bars.\nBut this year, nearly half the pro field\nswitched to the drop bars, which means\nwe have a much bigger data set to see\nwhether or not drop bars did in fact go\nfaster at Leadville. And so, of course,\nI took the top 20 men and women from\nlast year and compared their times to\nthis year to see if the ones that chose\nthe drop bars did, in fact, end up going\nfaster. I excluded riders that DNF this\nyear and riders that went way slower\nthis year for a reason that had nothing\nto do with handlebars, like Howard\nGratz, for example. And I also excluded\nKeegan, Russell, and myself because we\nchose drop bars last year, so obviously\nwe can't improve by choosing them again\nthis year. When you take the average\nrace time for the flat bar riders and\nthe drop bar converts and compare their\n2024 times to their 2025 times, flat bar\nriders went on average 8 minutes and 27\nseconds slower this year compared to\ntheir last year times. And this is\nlikely because conditions were not fast\nthis year. It was too dry and the air\nquality on race day was really bad due\nto wildfires. In fact, there were points\nduring the race that the AQI hit 150,\nwhich undoubtedly affected riders\nperformances. So, how did the Drop Bar\nconverts fare? They only went an average\nof 1 minute and 23 seconds slower than\nlast year, which would seem to indicate\nthat drop bar riders picked up a 7\nminute and 4 second advantage on average\nby choosing the drop bars. Is this\nperfect science? Absolutely not. There\nare so many uncontrolled variables that\nit's not even funny. But it's just a bit\nof fun to round out an otherwise\nemotional video. And here's where the I\ntold you so part comes in. Remember at\nthe top of the video what I told you I\nthought the advantage of running drop\nbars at Leadville was. That's right, six\nminutes. And the actual difference\nbetween flat bar and drop bar riders\nfrom last year to this year, 7 minutes.\nI think I'll end the video there. The\nfact that this is how this dude cheers\nhimself up after spilling his heart out\nabout nearly getting flattened by a\ntruck is just sad. Thanks for watching.\nIf you want to follow my racing closer,\nbe sure to check me out on Instagram.

year's Crusher in the toucher\nLeadville on Keegan comes in with the\nTarget on his back Keegan Square\n[Applause]\n[Music]\nthere's still a lot of question marks at\nthis point you're starting to see some\nFront Runners and some surprises\nI have to imagine that there's a group\nof athletes in the back end of the pack\nthat are thinking wow what you know\nwhat's happened\nbut they also have to be thinking\nthere's three more races big\nopportunities we're halfway through the\nlifetime Grand Prix series on tap is the\nlegendary Leadville 100.\nhe just kind of chills all the time he\nlikes to sunbathe\nyeah he's a fun guy to how he gets to\ncome up to Leadville this time he\ndoesn't get to come to a lot of races\njust because I fly to most of them so\nit's be a fun weekend it's just like a\ncamping trip in the mountains with a six\nhour race thrown in\nyeah Colorado Springs is home for me\nI've just always stuck around\nwe have this Trail in Colorado Springs\ncalled the shoots which is very aptly\nnamed\nyou can take like a dirt road climb up\nand then it's just this flow trail of\nsingle track with some jumps and you get\nto go fast\nand that's where I really got hooked on\nmountain biking I'd say\nmy whole family is pretty athletic my\ngrandpa was a professional golfer he\nactually won the PGA in 1958\nmy dad played hockey my mom played\nvolleyball and my aunt actually raced\nmountain bikes so that's sort of what\nled me into the racing side of mountain\nbikes once I was hooked on riding them\nI've always been kind of rooted in the\noutdoors and embracing the mountains\nI do a lot of the 14ers around here we\nhave 58 of them in Colorado I've hiked\n52 of them and when you're out there\nlike it's just there's nothing else in\nthe world that matters like all you're\nfocused on is it not falling off\nbasically\nyour goal is just to get to the summit\nand I like those sort of challenges\nwhere you can just kind of like leave\nthe outside world behind for a bit and\nyou just kind of become one with nature\nI wouldn't say I feel like cycling is a\njob but it is a job\nit's very structured and being able to\njust go hike mountains you get a lot\nmore free\nI grew up in Washington state and my\nfamily has a retail Sporting Goods store\nso Bike Shop in the summer ski shop in\nthe winter\nI think everyone I knew was some sort of\noutdoor enthusiast\nI gotta work on stuff with my hands like\nI was in the repair shop waxing skis\ntuning bikes and it was just my life\nfrom a very young age now that I get to\ndo it as a living in a different way is\nreally cool\nI feel like there's it's just always a\nroller coaster there's always highs and\nlows in sport and especially in my\npursuit of professional cycling\nI just graduated college and my plan was\nto pursue cycling and civilian I were\nboth on the same Factory team\nwe got it called it we've been dropped\nand we wouldn't have a contract for the\nnext year\nso it was multiple national champion at\nthat point I had multiple top 15s at\nWorld Cups and we were doing really well\nat least we thought at the time\nI went through like an identity crisis\nof like I don't know what I'm gonna do\nwe started reaching out to sponsors and\nwe got hundreds of no's that was super\ndiscouraging but the biggest turning\npoint for us was absolutely orange seal\nsaying that they're interested and\nwanted to support us as a couple and our\nindividual goals and that's what really\nfueled it and made us want to keep\nsearching for more\nI think we made just enough budget to\ntravel around to these races and nothing\nmore\nI'm just really proud to be here\nI'm one of the youngest athletes in the\nGrand Prix\nthis is the Pinnacle of racing in the\nUnited States and uh and I'm really\nfortunate to be part of it\nofficially leaving Durango for Leadville\nall right you guys drive safe yeah we\nwill\nI'll see you soon bye\na little sad to leave home here but uh\nreally excited for the weekend\nlight bill is a super cool Town high\ncity in the United States\nLeadville is just so unique there's so\nmuch history from the beginning it was\nall about what we could give not what we\ncould get and I told Mary Lee I said\nwe're going to treat our ass so it's\nlike customers and she said no okay I\ndidn't treat them like families\nand wow did that ever light all the\ncandles\nit seems even incomprehensible just to\nride a bicycle at this altitude but this\nyear for the first time on terrain just\nlike this not only are they riding\nbicycles in Leadville they're racing\nthem the mine closed in 82 the race\nstarted in 1983. that first year we had\n48 people on the starting line and 10\npeople finish\nand I think part of what made it magical\nis that it started and ended in\nLeadville\nwe sold the race series to Lifetime\nlifetime had been a sponsor thanks for\nLifetime the word about getting\ndetermination of Ledger was around\nthe race is an out and back dauntingly\nSteep and long to 12 400 foot Columbine\nmine it's so different from all the\nother events 12 or 13 000 feet of\nclimbing over 104 miles\nthis race is a beast I mean the record\nis right under six hours and we're\nclimbing up to 12 500 feet\nyou can't right out of your skin and you\ncan't like do anything too dumb because\nif you're you know over 10 000 feet\nelevation and it definitely plays a toll\nlevel's hard no matter how you put it I\nthink I break it up into somewhat of\nthree different segments\nby the Sugarloaf climb and the power\nline descent at the beginning are kind\nof that's the first kind of Crux of the\nrace\nby the top of Sugarloaf we start\ndescending down power line\nyou'll know somewhat of who the top 15\nguys that you're fighting with for the\nrest of the day\nso let's say that's the first main bit\nand then the next big part of the race\nis the Columbine minecline\nthat's it's about an hour long and it\ngoes up to like 12 400 something feet\njust a long steady grind\nit literally feels like a different\nplanet and there's so little air up\nthere that for me at least you start to\nalmost get this like claustrophobic\nfeeling like physiologically because\nyour body is just not doing what you\nshould do\nI think the group will try to get\nsmaller up Columbine but I don't think\nanyone's going to try to make a race\nwinning move I think Powerline is where\nit's going to really blow up on the way\nhome\nthat's kind of the last big part of the\nrace that's where it's kind of won or\nlost I think\nonce you get over Powerline on the way\nback you either got dropped or you are\nheaded toward winning the race it's all\nabout how do I feel what do I need how's\nmy bike doing before you get to the road\nclimb going back up to Carter Summit and\nthen Boulevard which boulevard is not\nthat hard in a big scheme of things but\nwe come in with three guys it's hard\nhey everybody how you doing\nwherever you make it to on this course\ntomorrow this is the Race Across the sky\nand this is Leadville it is not\npredictable\nI've been a racer I've been that person\nwho showed up and I'm like do I\nhave my together am I okay am I\nready for this races my backpack is if\nthis isn't this and what is that that's\nvery myopic right remember this is a\nsmall community at the end of the day\nright because there's a tension in town\naround these races I'm gonna head to\nmeet our canine guy okay\nthere's no parking your streets are shut\ndown multiple days in a row you can't go\nto Safeway and actually buy something to\neat because the shelves are empty right\nPublic Safety is number one so that's\nwhat we're here for it's into something\nyesterday\nthat's it that's it there's the safety\nin all those elements of any race but\nit's because of you that I'm here so\nthank you for what you're doing in the\nbackdrop do we get this right do we get\nthat right it's all tied to did we take\ncare of these people in this community\nas much as we took care of the athletes\nclean bike is good for the soul\nI like being my own bike mechanic\nbecause there's no one else to frame\nwhen things go wrong it's very\nfrustrating when there is someone to\nblame mid race\nsomeone therapeutic I mean there's times\nlike tonight that I'd rather just know\nthat my bike is ready to go\ntheoretically is\nbut um at the same time\nit's a good feeling when things go right\nand everything works and you trust it\nin 2015 when I got that email from the\nworld tour director I thought my entire\nlife ahead of me was road racing\nit was something that I did love and was\nso excited to embark on\nI think there's part of you that has to\nput away the like human caring for\nothers all the time side to be a A plus\nwinning athlete when I was in the world\ntour the best description would be to be\na machine\ndo you want to be the best in the world\nyou have to be on a regimen you're a\nteam worker right I was going to bed\ngetting 10 hours of sleep eating certain\namounts each day focused on big training\ncamps and being able to take in that\nvolume I think when you're in the world\ntour there's not much room for you to\nthink as an individual\nafter two years in the world tour there\nwere so many things I aspired to do and\na lot of my dreams weren't on the bike\nI feel like I had to move back to the US\nand work on making that positive impact\nand I took a pay cut to do that but it's\npaid off\nRoad riding is smooth simple you can go\nso far in such a short amount of time\nand then going to mountain bike all of a\nsudden got to experience these places I\nhad never seen you know I got to go into\nthe woods I didn't get to skip to pass\nthem and it opened up the world\nI found more enjoyment moving to the\nmountain bike it's just it's a little\nbit slower Pace in a way and there's\nthings to figure out technically very\ndifficult but as you start to figure\nthese things out you get to learn again\nweirdly Leadville is a very\nstraightforward to be on the podium\nthough you need to have a good luck day\nand have some legs that are you know\nmore than just a normal everyday\ntraining ride\nthrough here at Copper Mountain which is\nI think about 9 700 feet so basically\nthe same as Leadville\nthank you\nit's nice to stay close to the same\naltitude you're racing at for me I mean\nsome guys like to come in like the day\nbefore and I think for me it's nice to\nstay high\nyou just build more red blood cells and\ngives your body a chance to adapt to\nbeing at the high elevation because it\ntakes like about three weeks to get\nready for it so if you don't do that\nthen the best next best scenario is to\ncome like the day before and that way\nyour body doesn't even have time to\nrealize what's happened\nRussell's coming in the day before which\nI think maybe the best for him he's\nstill altitude he's only he's like six\nthousand feet but there's a difference\nbetween six and ten\nstarting at 10 000 feet the Leadville\n100 is punctuated by a punishing climb\nup Columbine topping out at 12 400 feet\nhopefully Riders have had time to catch\ntheir breath it will be hard to do out\non course\nI grew up in Park City Utah\nnow I live just out in Heber City so\npretty close so it's home I love it\nthere man in Utah's Utah is my home\nI mean I've always been competitive but\nI think for me it didn't really like\ntake until I started racing bikes\nboth my parents are you know very active\nI was outside doing stuff my dad and I\nused to go like Backcountry skiing right\nfrom the house when I was a kid and you\nknow he used to ski race and stuff and\nhe was younger and race bikes a bit\nI wouldn't say they were like strict\nparents by any means but they definitely\npushed me to do the best and kind of\nfocus on things you know they're like\nwell if you want to if you want to do\nthis then you should like put everything\ninto it you know don't just like\nhalf-ass it\nI think I took that to heart with bike\nracing\nyou know like this is something I really\nwant to do and I kind of made that my\nsingular Focus all through middle school\nhigh school that was the only goal\nI was like I want to be a professional\nbike racer I don't want to do anything\nelse\nthis is Willie also known as Sir Willie\non Instagram and he likes to ride bikes\nas soon as we drove into electrical you\ncould tell this town has definitely\npumped up everybody's buzzing I think\neverybody's really excited to be a good\nrace tomorrow you can feel the nerves\ncrackling you know I think there's some\nstatic in the air anxious excited yeah\nI've tried for 10 years to get into this\nin January I found out I'm in I better\nget a bike I better learn how to\nmountain bike and we've seen a lot of\nthe YouTube movies so like I mean it's\nexactly what we expected finishing under\n12. 11 59 59 is my Podium she's gonna\nfinish that's right\nbecause the mountain bike holds up\nshould be okay right yeah no not looking\nforward to Powerline but\n330 Plus\n120 is\n450 whatever 450 times\nsix is\nLeadville that's like we race it as pros\nand we're here to win but then there's\nalso these 2 000 other amateurs that are\nout there\nwe're kind of all out there on our own\nlittle journey which makes it really\ncool just to like share stories with\neveryone like what happened out there\nlike you tell people you ride Powerline\nand they just lose it their mind's blown\nthat we're able to ride up that but then\nlike they tell us they were out there\nfor 15 hours or whatever and like my\nmind's blown because that is a long time\non a bike I think that's what's pretty\nspecial about Leadville is just the wide\nrange of experience we're all trying to\nget out there\nI don't know this is my first year\nracing Leadville the way that these\nraces have been going this year it seems\nlike everyone just hits it from the\nstart to try to get separation so I mean\nwe could have a like a select group\nright off the bat up this first climb I\nmean just looking at the course\nColumbine is massive climbs all the way\nup to 12-5 it's a long one and then that\nthe scent right back down so this is our\nturnaround point\nhim will be descending\nwhile people are climbing it's going to\nbe chaos\nin a race like this I try to eat between\n80 and 100 grams of carbs an hour\nwhich is a lot of food but it's super\nkey to keeping energy levels as high as\npossible and it's easy to get behind\nquickly so you really have to stay on\ntop of it and half the battle is just\nhaving a plan like down to the gram what\nI'm gonna eat when\nit's a big math problem actually it gets\ncomplicated quickly\nhey Matt we might come hang out for the\ncamera\npretend like the routine is I just hang\nout with you while you work on my bike\nthe whole time\npersonally I'm feeling great about my\nfitness\ndid you do anything crazy to the bottom\nbracket this time uh\nyeah actually you know it was great to\nget fourth place points at Crusher but I\nwas super frustrated just because I felt\nso on fire and had a mechanical and it's\nkind of like man\ntwo out of three races like Miss sea\notter have a decent Unbound and then\nhave a great thing going for Crusher and\nthen have a puncture\nbut everyone's had\nbad luck other than Keegan\nlet's be honest like right now the Grand\nPrix is a race for second place and\nevery individual race is a race for\nsecond place too\nbut I'm starting to get tired of\nfinishing third and fourth and you know\nI would like to do better than that so\nwe'll see yeah I mean training's been\ngoing well\nbut we'll see what happens tomorrow you\nnever know\nyeah I just wrapped up breakfast here\nall of a sudden you're like oh no it's\ntime to get ready\nhad a good night of sleep jumped out of\nbed stunk to get it going so yeah\nfeeling good yeah\nthat's right this morning here in\nand getting things ready to rock and\nroll there's always a bit of pressure\nyou know but I don't think it's any more\nthan any other race\num you know just to show up and do what\nI do and that's it\nobviously anybody in the top 10 has a\nlot to gain by you know by being\ncompetitive and and I think we could\nhave somebody that hasn't been so\ncompetitive uh in the series yet really\nkind of rise at Leadville\nWaukegan currently has a stronghold on\nfirst place Russell finsterwald is now\nin second he currently has a two-point\nlead over Alexi Vermilion and I'm sure\nhe wouldn't mind strengthening that lead\ntake a second look around you notice\nwhere you are notice who you're with\nwork together in those places that you\nneed to lots of smiles big deep have an\nawesome time\nhere we are in a beautiful crisp Rocky\nMountain morning in downtown Leadville\nColorado\nwe're starting at 10 200 feet above sea\nlevel and it only goes up from here\nas part of leadville's story tradition\nthe shotgun blast will signal the start\nand the Riders are off the race begins\nwith a neutral start as the Riders fall\nlead Vehicles out of town on West 6th\nStreet there's roughly three miles of\npavement ahead of them before the fun\nbegins\nand as the Riders make that turn onto\nthe gravel the vehicles clear out of the\nway and the group is off\ngotta have the ability to to push\nyourself at altitude 30 percent less\noxygen than sea level and to sustain\nyourself you know between you know\neating and you know maintaining your\nheart rate and the energy output\nand here we are now starting to make\nthat climb up Saint Kevin's gears are\nshifting and power outputs climbing but\nthe group is still tight together as\nthey make their way up and over Carter\nSummit so sitting in front of me in the\nGrand Prix is Keegan and Russell Keegan\nis quite a ways off and Russell's one\npoint ahead of me so I think it's rice\nper second but I don't think it's just\nbetween Russell and I now the Riders\nturned back onto gravel making their way\nto the climb up Sugarloaf Howie Payson\ncoal\nwe got a lot of Firepower behind us\nand it looks like Alexia Vermilion is\nalready making an attack or wait no he's\npulling over with a mechanical let's\nhope it's nothing serious\nokay gets Megan moving he's trying to\ndraft us go go go\nbut he's making his move they're about\nto turn\nas the Riders make the turn onto\nSugarloaf you can see Keegan Swenson\npulling ahead\nKeegan has been a dominating force in\nthis series with full points at every\nrace so far he won Leadville last year\nand he's ready to do it again this year\nafter dropping Unbound coal pack Cole\nPatton is another racer who has a lot on\nthe line\nCrusher was a huge race with a strong\nsecond place finish hopefully he can\nride that momentum for a strong\nperformance here in Leadville\nI'm riding a new hardtail from Scott\nsuper light I'm going with two two five\ntires just because I'm not willing to\nrisk it\nheading down the power line descent the\ngroup is stretched out a little we still\nhave Swenson Lachlan Morton and fincy\nout front with probably 20 Riders strung\nout with two to five seconds in between\neach\nI'll be running a 36 tooth chain ring\nbut I have a pretty big range in the\nrear with a 10 by 52 cassette\nhopefully I'll be with the group and can\nkind of tuck in and conserve energy that\nway not just motoring to try to set a\nrecord or something\nas long time friends and training\nPartners we can expect to see Russell\nand Keegan working together as long as\npossible Keegan's one of my best friends\nwe've been racing bikes together since\nwe were 15 or 16 years old he likes to\ngo out and just smash big rides and with\nthe same thoughts on racing and training\nso yeah it works out well in the races\nyou know we kind of work together\nsometimes as a team if it works out in\nour benefit and then when it comes down\nto it we're racing each other it could\nbe a little frustrating like you have\none of your friends just beating up on\nyou all the time\nbut yeah I think like we've definitely\nhelped bring each other's level up we\npush each other if that means I have to\nfinish second two and sometimes then\nthat's what it means\nback on pavement after the power line\ndescent the Riders are bunching back up\nagain it doesn't look like anyone's\nready to give up those group tactics to\nmake an attack quite yet\nyou can see them all working together\ntaking pulls up front and moving back\nhere we come to the pipeline aid station\nthe feeds are coming quickly but I'm not\nseeing much slowing down you know who\nI'm not seeing in this lead group\nanymore is Payson or Lachlan\nforeign\nRussell still working hard together Todd\nWells John Gaston and Matthew beers\nhanging in there it's also good to see\nAlexian Cole with the front group\nall right here comes the lead Moto\nso we're four to five minutes away\nfrom the elite Riders\nand here they come into the Twin Lakes\naid station this is mile 40 and that\nsame group of 10 is still tight together\nall within four seconds of each other\nColumbine we usually have something like\n10 guys\ndropping down off the top at the\nturnaround point it could be\nthree maybe five it's one of the big big\nselection happens the lead group is\ngetting closer and closer to Columbine\nalmost in the shadow of the mountain now\nthis is where the rubber meets the road\nthe Crux of the race and the climb\nthat's made the Leadville 100 famous who\nwill be able to hang on the Steep 3000\nfoot plus climb this is where those legs\nand lungs start to burn as the oxygen\ngets thin\nit becomes almost like a slow motion\nrace like a 10 second Gap is an eternity\nlike you can see someone\n25 yards up the road but you can't just\nSprint across the Gap because there's\njust zero oxygen up there\nand there's Payson who seems to be\nstruggling we hear a mechanical is what\nheld him back early in the race and he's\ngot his work cut out for him\npart of the gamble we all take when we\ngo on the start line is is luck on our\nside today\nand here we have our first live look\nfrom the top and no surprises here is\nit's Keegan Swenson who is separated\nfrom the group and is approaching the\ntop of Columbine\nand now is when we see the toll that\nColumbine has taken at the top Keegan\nnow has almost a three-minute lead on\nHoward the whole group is broken apart\nlet's go Howard yeah\nno man's land in second is Howard grotz\nfollowed by Alexi Vermilion less than\ntwo minutes behind Alexi's Cole Patton\nand John Gaston not part of the Grand\nPrix it looks like Russell has fallen\nback to six\nthe massive Columbine climb brings the\ngroup down to just a select handful turn\naround do it all backwards\nback at the bottom of Columbine and it\nlooks like no one was able to catch\nKeegan on the downhill as he comes\nflying into the Aid Station below\nif someone gets off the front they have\na long lonely road back of like 40 miles\nsolo\nyou don't know what's going on behind\nyou so you have to keep focused and keep\ncharging and I'm going to run a 38 tooth\nchainring and most guys only use 36s so\nI think as long as I can like snap that\nelastic and separate from the group then\nno one's going to catch me if I can spin\nout the 3810 back in the flats Keegan is\nstill holding on to his substantial lead\nbut behind him a Chase group is bunched\nup and it looks like they're pulling and\nusing their combined strength to try and\nclose the gap\nthere's a little bit of a headwind so\nit'll be interesting to see if they can\nmake up any time before they get to\nPowerline if you can create that Gap\nthen confident enough you could make it\na power line with it and it's game over\nand here we go Keegan starting up power\nline this is the last real obstacle that\nseparates him from the Finish Line the\nchase group is doing what they can to\nclose the gap but somehow Keegan just\ncontinues to widen his lead\nunless something goes wrong here you\nhave to imagine that he's going to\ncruise to the finish line\nthe important attack will happen coming\nback up power line on the way back at\nlike Mile 80. and with Keegan up and\nover it looks like our Chase group is\njust going to be battling for second at\nthis point Alexi has a slight lead with\nHoward John Cole right on his tail\nhit pavement working his way up\nturquoise Lake Road his lead is now 12\nminutes and I think he might break six\nhours\nI thought that you're talking you're\ntalking a good three miles separating\nfirst and second place at this point\nonly time will tell and what we're going\nto do now is we're going to kind of turn\nour attention down Sixth Street uh we're\nanticipating Keegan Crest the top of\nSixth Street courtesy of meat Motors\nI mean the series is still I mean we're\nonly halfway through and our mindset's\nstill the same as it was at the\nbeginning I keep racing heavy races if\nit's the only one I mean it's not over\ntill it's over you know you need to keep\ncharging and just stay on the gas\nmaking his way down the final stretch\nKeegan is all alone last year he won\nwith a time of six hours 11 minutes and\n26 seconds and he's clearly going to\nbeat it here he comes right on the money\nKeegan has done it again the media has\nplenty of time to get all their\ninterviews because it'll be nearly 15\nminutes before the next Rider crosses\nfield was definitely more talented this\nyear we had more depth with the Grand\nPrix so we were rolling faster on the\nway out\nit looks like John Gaston was going to\nbe able to Edge out Howard grotz for the\nsecond place finish\nJohn isn't in the Grand Prix however so\nHowie will get those second place points\nfinishing up third in the Grand Prix is\na Lexi I couldn't have done\nkind of the goal\ntomorrow be back next year for sure I\ndon't know why but I'll be back\nI thought my game was over but then I\nsaw my teammate Sophia she gave me her\nrear wheel which is like the nicest\nthing ever without her I definitely like\nwouldn't have been able to ride back\ninto the top ten so salvage a little bit\nof lifetime points\num I was hoping for a little more today\nwith four races down here are our\ncurrent standings Keegan's lead keeps\ngrowing with 90 points Cole Patton has\nmoved up to second place with 82 points\nAlexi burmulin has 80 points Russell has\ndropped from second to Fourth now with\n79 points\nand a huge congrats to all of the Riders\non an incredible race besides Keegan's\nfirst position the Grand Prix\nleaderboard is getting interesting with\nonly two races left we'll see you at\nschwamagan",
