Over 5,000 people chase roughly 1,600 spots through a December lottery system, with backup qualifier races if you miss out.

Twelve hours to complete it or you don't get the coveted finisher's buckle. This isn't some gentle century ride; it's a legitimate suffer-fest that separates tourists from cyclists."

        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "The course throws legitimate technical challenges at you—Powerline descent, Pipeline climbs, and rocky sections that demand bike handling skills beyond just grinding watts. But this isn't Moab slickrock or North Shore stunts; it's mountain trail riding that rewards smart line choice and descending confidence more than trials bike wizardry. Technical enough to punish the unprepared, manageable enough that fitness matters more than fear."

        "score": 5,
        "explanation": "Roughly 12,000 feet of climbing packed into 100 miles—that's 120 feet per mile average, but the reality hits harder on climbs like Columbine Mine. You're grinding uphill for hours, not just tackling a few punchy climbs. The relentless vertical gain breaks legs and spirits; there's no hiding from the math when every mile averages more elevation than most people climb in a weekend ride."

        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "August in the Colorado Rockies means you start in pre-dawn cold and finish in afternoon heat, but altitude keeps temperatures manageable compared to desert races. Weather can turn fast above treeline—thunderstorms, hail, or blazing sun within hours of each other. The thin air dries you out faster than sea level, but you won't be melting in 110-degree furnace conditions like Arizona summer races."

        "explanation": "Starting at 10,152 feet and climbing to 12,424 feet at Columbine Mine—this is legitimate high-altitude suffering where every breath delivers less oxygen. Most people live at sea level; here you're racing where the air is 40% thinner than your lungs expect. Altitude sickness isn't theoretical—it's the invisible hand choking your power output for hours on end."

      "adventure": {
        "score": 5,
        "explanation": "This is the race that made ultra-endurance cycling mainstream, where finishing earns you a belt buckle and legitimate bragging rights. You're riding through genuine Colorado wilderness, hitting historic mining territory, and joining a select group—only those who survive 12 hours in the thin air get the buckle. The sub-9-hour 'big buckle' is cycling's version of a black belt; maybe 150-200 riders out of 1,600 starters earn it each year."
