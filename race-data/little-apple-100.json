          "description": "This is a gravel race in Manhattan Illinois, beautifully organized by the South Chicago Wheelmen. The race is 2 laps of a 50k course thru farm roads, with a small bit of pavement, mostly 'normal' gravel, and one or two sections of 'pretty loose'. My tires were 40mm G-One Speed at probably like 50 PSI. I'd do the same thing next time - this race isn't one I could ride 28mm. It rained just before the race, but the sun came out as we started. Steady wind from the South.\n\nVideo starts as we roll thru the finish line with 50k done and 50k to go. The group is reduced to about 30 here. \n\n56:06 - Starts to get selective. Tailwind section here.\n57:35 - Crosswind left-to-right. Group can smell the finish, it's time to go hard.\n59:52 - This is such a good spot to rest up for a moment. Riders in the left lane are shelter from the wind, plus rider in front.\n1:02:15 - This is pretty much the group that made it to the finish together.\n1:07:33 - Left turn onto probably the loosest section here. You can see that my soft-over-hard skills are totally absent here. Wind is right to left, once we make the turn. Don't worry, I'm still getting quite a bit of shelter even one lane over :)\n1:27:03 - This is where you see Sean's race-winning sprint",
