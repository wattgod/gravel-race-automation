Race day 2022 delivered \"27° in the morning 55° in the afternoon. Partly sunny. Peak color change.

        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Small field of under 70 finishers in 2022 consists mainly of regional riders. Dan Teaters' three wins and Mitch Edbauer as a \"three-time competitor\" represent the competitive ceiling for this grassroots Michigan event. Thinner field than Ouray Gravel Grinder."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Race proceeds directly support local fire department equipment purchases, giving entry fees community impact beyond event costs. Three distance options and the grassroots approach provide accessible racing without commercial markup."

      "expenses": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Registration runs $60-90. Iron Mountain's small-town costs keep lodging and food expenses minimal. Required GPX device and rear flashing light represent the main equipment investments beyond standard gravel gear. Regional location eliminates flight costs for Midwest riders. More affordable than Crusher in the Tushar."
