          "transcript": "the guys that ride in the Green Bay\narea. Um like Mitch said, we we often\nride together. Um a lot of the uh the\ntraining rides, you know, we'll we'll\ncoordinate and we'll make sure that\nwe'll we'll bring a few of us with even\nif we're not on the same team. And um it\nreally does make for a good cycling\ncommunity. Um and you know, we get to\nknow how each other ride. Um, that's the\nthat's the interesting part is, you\nknow, all of a sudden Mitch knows my\nweaknesses and he knows where I'm good\nand uh it's it's no secret um what he\nand his teammates are good at. So, um,\npreparing for a race, knowing who's\ngoing to be there, um, that's the extra\nelement. And when you're outnumbered,\nuh, four to one, um, at at the start\nline, you just kind of, oh boy, you just\ngot to swallow and say, here we go. Um,\nand yeah, I Mitch and his teammates,\nthey put together a plan. It was very\nobvious. Um and that that plan was\nexecuted very well.\n[Music]\ntightly\nfrom KM Cycling and Michigan Midpack\nMedia. Welcome to the Dirty Chain\nPodcast, the podcast that covers the\ncycling scene from the viewpoint of the\nMichigan Midpack. I am your host Trevor\nand on this episode we hear about the\nLone Wolf Gravel Race out of Iron\nMountain, Michigan with race founder\nJames Marorrow and repeat competitors\nDan Heers and Mitch\nEd. Folks, we are 2023 at what seems to\nbe probably the height of gravel racing.\nUh, from its humble beginnings of a\ngrassroots mass start events, gravel of\ncourse has evolved and grown in\npopularity in a way um, I think few of\nus could have ever imagined. I mean,\nthis year alone, uh, we've seen the\nfirst US National Gravel Championships.\nUm, we just saw the second gravel worlds\nthat took place in Italy that seem to be\na bit more accepted by the whole gravel\ncommunity. Uh there's still an extremely\npopular national race series with a\nlifetime Grand Prix. And uh it just\nseems like more and more professional\ncyclists are now identifying themselves\nas gravel pros. And uh hey, I love it. I\nthink it's exciting. As a fan, as an\nathlete, um I can participate in some of\nthese larger events. I can follow these\nathletes.\nUm, but as much as I love this and I\nlove the larger races and the huge\nevents, part of me still connects more\nwith the smaller local grassroot events\nthat started this whole trend in the\nfirst\nplace. Races like the lone\nwolf.\nNow, this episode serves a couple\ndifferent purposes. one, as we discussed\nlater, while I was aware of the race of\nthe Lone Wolf, um I didn't know too much\nabout it and I um I I've never raced it\nand I think it's mostly because of how\nfar away it is from. Uh I'm downstate\nMichigan and it's pretty darn far up in\nthe UP. Um, so I was excited to hear\nmore about its history from race creator\nand bike bag fabricator James\nMarorrow. But two, what we're about to\nhear is a real behindthecenes look at\ncompetition and tactics during racing.\nUh, three Pete winner Dan Teters and\nthree Pete competitor Mitch Ed share a\nreally cool story about what went down\nthis year, what team tactics Mitch\nimplemented to attempt to unseat Dan and\nwhat resulted because of that. And in a\nway, I think this kind of story, this\nkind of experience, as you will hear, is\none that you can only that can only\nexist within local grassroots\num races, within the local grassroots\nscene,\nuh where you race and ride with some of\nthe same people, race after race, year\nafter year. Something I think many of\nyou will resonate with.\nSo, let's jump right in. The Lone Wolf\nwith James Marorrow, Mitch Ed Bower, and\nthreetime winner Dan\nTeters. Yeah, thank you gentlemen uh for\njoining me today, this afternoon. Um, we\ngot a full house here to talk about the\nLone Wolf, uh, the gravel race that\nhappened last weekend, right? October,\nwas it October 8th? 9th. Yeah. Sunday.\nOkay. So, uh, yeah, joining me now, um,\nwe have James Marorrow, the the founder\nof the race, and then, um, two athletes,\ntwo participants, Dan Teters and Mitch\nEd. Um, besides your names, can we kind\nof go around and um, could you give me a\nlittle bit of introduction? Uh, James,\nyou want to start and then we'll maybe\nmove to uh, Dan and Mitch? Sure. Yeah.\nI'm uh, James Marorrow, the founder and\ncreator of the Lone Wolf.\num down an Iron Mountain in 2020 trying\nto find a a as much gravel route as\npossible and and uh me and my\nbrother-in-law basically found that loop\nand I think it was like 42 miles we\nadjusted it to get it to right at 50 um\non one of our spring rides ran up on a\nnice big grey wolf all mangy and\nwouldn't get off the road for us and\nthat was kind of what established the\nthe name and just sitting around and I\njust thought you know I knew there\nenough gravel races in or gravel racers\nin the area to kind of, you know,\nshowcase that being a route and thought\nit'd be really cool to see some some\npeople lay it down out there. And so it\nwas just kind of a an idea and honestly\nthought there'd be like 10 people that\nshowed up, mostly friends or something\njust to support it and have a a party\npace, but people showed up even the\nfirst year. So it was pretty cool. What\nwas that? What was the first year? Uh\n2020. 2020. I think it would have been\n21. Yeah. 21. Okay. Yep. Um Dan, I know\nthat you of course wrote it this year,\nbut um you have, am I right in that\nyou've written it or raced it every\nsingle year that it's been around?\nYeah, I you know, I was trying to think\nthis morning um how I had heard about it\nfirst and I I think there was just some\nword of mouth and uh and maybe a post on\nFacebook And um I thought, hey, this\nlooks like an interesting little event.\nUm go up and check it out. And uh yeah,\nit was it was a you know, small\ngrassroots but well-run. Um everybody\nseemed uh really excited for it. Um\neverybody was pretty happy and jovial\nand and that's really, you know, kind of\nmakes the event everybody enjoyed\nthemselves. So um I thought, hey, this\nis kind of cool. I'm going to keep\ncoming back. and it's been a good event\never since. And uh the changes that were\nmade in the last year or two um added a\nlittle distance, added a little spice\nand some flavor to the course uh which\nwas uh definitely appreciated. I enjoyed\nthat. Um and James has done a good job\nuh putting on the event. So I'd be happy\nto come back again um and continue my uh\nmy participation in it next year. Dan,\nyour winning streak. Your winning\nstreak. Oh, we'll get to that in a\nsecond.\nUm, but Dan, are you predominantly a\ngravel rider, road rider, and where do\nyou where do you live and where do you\nride out of? Um, mostly. Yeah, so I uh I\nI grew up in the Shboan area. Um, and\nthen I went to school at WGB in Green\nBay. Um, and I've kind of been there\never since. Um, I left for a short while\nafter I graduated. I was in Texas. um\ndid a lot of road racing with uh with\nsome top elite level road racers down in\nthat area. Okay. Um learned a lot when I\nwas down there in just those short two\nyears. But um came back to the Green Bay\narea in 2009 and uh been in the area\never since. Um and as far as my\ndisciplines go, I'm kind of a jack of\nall trades. I'm kind of a goofball. Um\nI've got a long history of mountain bike\nracing. Uh I I've done a lot of\nhighlevel road races and crits. Um and\never since the gravel stuff popped up,\nit's uh it's really been kind of a fun\ninfusion of both that you've got the\nroad tactics, you've got the skill of of\nmountain biking. Um not to mention my\ncyclacross background. Um yeah, I just\nkind of a jack of all trades. I just\nenjoy it all. That's great.\nUm Mitch, how what's what's your history\nwith the with the Lone Wolf? Has was\nthis your first year this year? Have you\ndone it uh previous years? And then\nyeah, give us a little background on on\nyour cycling, riding, racing. Sure. So,\nuh I have also done the Lone Wolf all\nthree years. Okay, great. So, I'm a I'm\na native of Yuper. uh grew up in\nKingsford, Michigan, which is a a sister\ntown to Iron Mountain where the you\nknow, James puts on the race. So, it's a\na nice local event for me. Good good\nreason to get back home, spend some time\nwith uh my parents. Um when it comes to\nracing, um like like Dan said, I went to\nschool at Michigan Tech. um had a lot of\nbuddies that were into mountain biking.\nSo, kind of learned to mountain bike\nvery poorly. Well, I spent uh my years\nup at Michigan Tech, graduated in 2009\nas well, moved down to Green Bay, um and\njust found um more of a passion in\ncycling. You know, there weren't as many\nuh nearby trails for mountain biking as\nH Hotton, Michigan. So, I kind of picked\nup my first road bike. um started, you\nknow, actively training. Got into the\nwhole triathlon thing. Um Yep. Yep. Uh\ndid that for a little bit. Um but I I\nguess kind of like Dan, you know, I\npretty much participate in as as many in\nvaried races as I can. Um, you know, I\ndon't have quite the the tenure\nbackground like Dan does, but uh, you\nknow, I've lost several cyclacross races\nand I've lost several mountain bike\nraces and, uh, continue to lose gravel\nraces, but always have a good time doing\nit. So, yeah, fantastic. Um, so yeah, we\nkind of covered a little bit with that\nabout um, when the race began, uh, a\nlittle bit about the what kind of a\ncourse it is.\na little bit. But, um, I'm interested in\nthe race history. Uh, Dan, you mentioned\nthat, you know, this year there were\nsome some additions that made things a\nlittle more fun, a little more spicy.\nBut, um, how has this race kind of\nprogressed from the beginning? Um,\nJames,\nuh, from day one, from from race one,\num, what kind of a race was it? What did\nyou hope to put on? And, um, how long of\na race? I mean, you said is around 50\nmiles, correct? Yeah. Yep. Okay. 50. It\nwas a 50 mileer from the front door. And\nthen once we figured out where we could\npotentially start and stop it, it came\nout to like 42. Um, I was a little bit\nbummed about, you know, it's not very a\nlot of people like to put, you know, 100\nmile and it's like 115 miles or\nsomething like that. But I actually\nreached with Mitch and asked him, you\nknow, you think people are going to kind\nof be bent out of shape that it's, you\nknow, a little bit shorter. And he\nassured me that, you know, it wasn't\ngoing to be a problem. So, we just ran\nwith it from there. Um, and then we got\npermission from a uh, you know, it was\nat Fumy Lake. Um, and they're they have\na board and it's kind of a protected\narea and that was a little bit of a\nstruggle to get them. They have some\ngates and stuff that we had to get open.\nUm, and the first year worked out great\nand it went off without a hitch. And\nthen uh the following year we we did the\nsame procedure, asked for permission and\nthey weren't going to allow allow us to\nopen the gates um which I kind of seen\nas a you know a little bit of a\nroadblock for keeping the flow\nespecially the gates were at the the\nfinish line for the thing. So people are\ngoing to have to get off and go around.\nThis is the time to sprint. You know you\ngot like a last two miles going around\nin a twotrack. Um so we made the call.\nWe found another alternative alternative\nroute um to get up and connect uh to the\noriginal route, but it was I think it\nwas about 10 more miles of pretty\naggressive chunky stuff. Um it clipped a\npiece of private land. Uh we had like a\ngodscent because DNR had just put in a\nnew section of trail to bypass that for\nOV and stuff. Um so it last year it was\npretty fresh. a lot of dozer dozer\ntracks for a few miles. And um I\nremember the first year when Dan came\nthrough with Mark Crowns and he said,\nyou know, that last little bit was kind\nof blasphemy because it it was\nbeautiful. It was brand new paved road\nfor, you know, six miles or whatever it\nwas and then you get a little bit of\ntwotrack. Um so I was happy to give him\nthat at for the ending and he wasn't\nsuper excited about it. Like a like a\nlike like a a cherry on top, if you\nwill. Yeah. Yeah. It was nice to see a\nlittle bit of a little bit of struggle\nout of them coming through. Yeah. James,\nyou mentioned that it was uh you know,\nyou you hoped that maybe a couple people\nwould show up the first year, maybe\nthought it'd be like you and your\nbuddies, but you had a pretty good\nturnout. Have you seen progressive\ngrowth um each each year? Uh it's\nactually stayed pretty close to the same\nvolume every year.\nUm, but a lot of, you know, a lot of it\nstays the same, but a lot of new people\nare coming and trying it. And that was\nkind of the idea is just to to get\npeople, you know, riding around that\ncourse in the fall. It's it's just kind\nof something to see. And, you know, it's\nyour typical up gravel. Um, and that\nthat area needed something. And that was\nkind of my passion for it was um in 2020\nI started a nonprofit like I just called\nit an Iron Hill cycling team to get it\njust to be able to ask people for money\nand not make it seem like they're just\ngiving James Marl money um to create\nevent around there and uh got a hold of\nChris Schmidt and had him make up a\nposter and every time we would get a\nsponsor it it gave us the ability okay\nnow we can get a poster and and now we\ncan kind of promote it a little bit more\nand throw it in some bike shops and then\nwe were able to get awards and that's\nkind of what I figured as as long as we\nhave an image for it and and awards. I\nmean in a route you you basically have a\nrace. Um so that was the idea. So it was\npretty cool. The first year we basically\njust spent everything on the awards. Um\nwhich was really cool. like\nglow-in-the-dark um trophies. And uh and\nthen after that then it was kind of cool\nafter that first year there was a little\nyou know a few of my friends were\nactually interested in becoming board\nmembers and and getting this thing\ngoing. There's a you know a little bit\nof influx of of of money and then we can\nkind of get a little bit more structure\nand more opinions and what people think\nand uh it's it's been working out pretty\ncool.\nThat's great.\num you mentioned uh you kind of had the\na similar um amount of participation,\nbut I think that uh um seeing returnees\ncome back every year, that's got to be a\nuh a good sign. And we have two of them\nhere, of course. Um right,\nyou know, I'm not as familiar with um\nthat far over that far west in the UP.\nwhat makes\nthat uh terrain unique um or is it\nunique or what you know um so like Dan\nwhat's your favorite like unique part of\nthe course or what do you love most\nabout like the course in itself the\nterrain and the um yeah it you know I I\nlike courses that uh that offer a\nvariety of different terrain um you know\nit it gives everybody an opportunity and\na certain spot on the course to really\nexcel. And hopefully um you know through\nthe entirety of that race, the cream\nrises to the top and it's the person\nthat can manage the the course and the\nconditions and the competition um to\ntheir the best of their ability and and\ncome out on top. Um so the Lone Wolf\ncourse is a it's just a prime example of\nthat. You know, it's not just smooth\ngravel the whole way. It's it's sections\nof smooth gravel. You've got a couple of\npaved sections. Um, you've got some\nsections of of gravel that are fistsized\ngravel. Um, it it's it's small rocks.\nIt's uh it's chunky. Um, and then to\nfinish off the race on what is almost\narguably a mountain bike trail um in the\nlast seven of the 10 miles. Um, it it\nreally does it just throws in a little\nbit of flare for everything. And um it\nmakes it really entertaining.\nThat's great. Um Mitch, what do you find\nthat uh you love about the course? What\nmakes it unique for you or what keeps\nyou coming back each year?\nYeah, I mean, I guess first and\nforemost, you know, James and and the\nteam do a incredible job, you know,\nputting it on. It's fun. Um it's it's\ngood vibes the whole time. Um\neverybody's um there to compete but also\nyou know there to have a good time first\nand foremost. Um you know compared to\nthe first year like like Dan said there\nwas a or James there was a big section\nof road at the end which is you know\ntends to suit someone like me who's a\nlittle bit bigger can push the pedals a\nlittle bit harder. Um but the the the\nnew course which which I really like is\nis you know your tire selection. what\nbike, right? The guy that got uh and\nmaybe this is getting into it, uh second\nplace in the 100 mile, right? Wrote a\nmountain bike. You know, there's there's\nadvantages to that through some of those\nsections when it's chunky and it's\nloose. And um one of the things that\nmakes it interesting for a person like\nme and helps me put some thought into it\nis um there's a lot of very short sharp\nhills. You know, I'm I'm 6'4, nearly\n6'5, you know, 200 lb. It makes it a\nreally big challenge to race, you know,\nsomewhat of Dan's caliber through there.\nSo, you gotta uh try to plan a little\nbit when the gravel's smoother and um\nfaster rather than through that chunky\nstuff where he's where he's so good.\nYeah, that's rode a mountain bike, huh?\nHuh. That canyon. I forget what it was,\nbut Yeah, the old full suspension canyon\nwith arrow bars on it. Yeah. Yeah. Um\nuh was the changes in the course just\nthe changes in the end with the um the\ngates or James was there a total uh\ncourse change this year? Um there was\ntwo sections um that we changed the end\num we brought them up and around that um\nsanctuary area and then I believe we\nwent up towards Felch. So we we brought\nthem north so they missed the original\nroute would go um you know from the\nstart about I think it's maybe 15 miles\nin you would keep if you kept going\nstraight that was the original route. I\nfound more gravel to be able to go north\nand gain an extra like 12 miles out of\nthat. Um and or maybe it's just under\n12, but that gave us the the 50 miles,\nyou know, mark uh to call, you know, to\njust make an official Lone Wolf 50. Um\nand the gravel that we found up there\nwas just pristine. Um there's like a f\nit's called Finttown Road. I think it's\nmaybe four miles, but it's just your\njust rolling tree canopy, rolling\ngravel. Um, and it's you just kind of\nget almost distracted up there with how\nbeautiful it is. Um, and that by doing\nthat brought us on some pavement. Um,\nbut it's kind of no man's land out\nthere. So, you don't even see much\ntraffic. I I always try to make it, you\nknow, as remote as possible just because\nthat was my always my biggest concern\nwas safety and vehicles and good old\nboys out there and stuff like that. Try\nto keep people kind of away from all\nthat. But, um, it it also created a\nlittle bit of dynamic for the group. um\nfor people to pack up and like Mitch\nsaid, you know, to get some some like\nroadie backgrounds a chance um at the\ngravel scene um because just after that\npave section is the truck trail, which I\nthink Dan might have been referring to\nwith the the boulders in the road and\nit's it's 10 miles of roller coaster\nchunky gravel. I think there's a 18 and\n12 inch grade out there. you know, your\nback tires are kind of spinning to get\nup some of them. And uh but yeah, it\nturned out really well. And that by\nmaking that extra loop, we were actually\nable to create a 36. So coming back\ndown, tapping into the original route,\npeople were able to take a right turn\nand head back to the start finish, and\nthat created the 36 mile. Um you know,\nthat was that was going to be another\nquestion of mine that um is 50 the only\noffering or do you have any other\ndistances? Um So, we were able to create\nthat 36. Um, and then I know, you know,\nlast year, uh, Jason Lowitz kind of\nchimed in a few times to me like, \"Hey,\nyou gonna you gonna make a a 100 mileer,\nyou know, for the endurance guys?\" And,\nyou know, maybe a 100 mileer. And I was\nlike, \"Well, we can make a 100 mileer,\nbut it takes you across a couple\nhighways and stuff like that.\" And like\nI said with the safety thing, I said,\n\"Well, let's just do two laps, you know,\nwhich would be cool for spectating and\nand stuff like that, too.\"\nUm, did you do a 100 mile? Yep. Oh,\nokay. Okay. Yep. I think we had 12 12\nguys show up for that. Okay.\nInteresting. You know, the the one thing\nthat um that stands out to me is that\nit's a predominantly a 50 mile race\nand I mean you all of you know that\neverything just seems to be getting\nlonger and longer and longer and it's\nkind of I don't know. It's almost it's\ngetting ridiculous in my mind. Um, you\ncan say it's it's annoying. It's\nannoying. Yeah, it sure is. But, uh, to\nbe a to just be like, no, 50 is our\nsweet spot. That's what we do and that's\nwhat the majority of the, um, the racers\nlike to participate in. And then to be\nable to have a course dynamic enough\nwithin 50 miles where obviously there's\ngoing to be um, packs breaking up and\nselections made. I think that's pretty\nuh not only unique but but pretty cool\nto offer um to I don't know your area or\nto any any racer that wants to um take\npart in it.\nYeah, I was definitely glad to see this\nyear people kind of work together\nbecause the first year it was it was\nkind of boggling where you know you in\ngravel you expect to be able to work\ntogether you know create some some kind\nof packs out there. Um, but it as soon\nas people hit the truck trail, it was\njust a line of people and there\neverybody was all by themselves. There\nwere 68 people riding by themselves out\nthere like, \"Man, you guys got to work\ntogether and stuff.\" But I think the\nonly two people that might have stayed\ntogether on the first year was Dan and\nMark Cray and and they laid it down, but\nfor obvious reasons, nobody really, you\nknow, kept up with those guys. I did my\nbest. I still have nightmares. I have\nnightmares on Carney Lake Road still.\nThat is tough. And I mean I I know uh\nit's I have some some hard lessons of\nthings like that happening early on like\na 100 mile race and then you're by\nyourself for 75 miles and it's it's a\nlong 75 miles. But uh no, I I do like\nthe idea of just 50 miles going out\nriding hard. Um, you finish\nbefore it's dinner time. I mean, that's\nanother positive,\nbut uh, very cool. So, yeah, I do want\nto know more about I mean, I wanted to\nhear about Lone Wolf. I I've definitely\nheard of it, but I don't know enough\nabout it. And again, I think being\ndownstate, it's it's just I I think it's\njust a proximity thing of there's\nthere's a lot of races down here. I do\nmight make my way up into the UP a\ncouple times a year, but not any further\nthan Marquette. So, I think the Lone\nWolf, I knew of it as a UP gravel race,\nbut it just seemed a little bit distant\nto me. So, one, I think this is cool to\nget uh to get to know about it more, but\nthen James, you reached out a couple\ndays ago and you said, \"Hey, Trevor, um\nthis race has been going on a few years.\nThere's been some repeaters, some heavy\nhitters, but this year there was a cool\nstory about the uh I guess the race at\nthe front and and you and you said it\nmore than just me and my buddies need to\nhear this story. I feel like this would\nbe a good story for the podcast. And I\nwas like, heck yeah, let's let's talk\nabout it. Um, so we kind of brushed over\nit a little bit, but Dan, you have won\nthis race each of the years that it's\nbeen offered, correct? Yep. Yep. Made it\nthree in a row this year. All right. All\nright. The the hattrick. Yeah. I I I\nreferred to it as the turkey. So the\nturkey. Well, I mean, here's the issue,\nthough. You can't not come back now. I\nmean, I think you have to keep coming\nback until you don't achieve the same\nresult.\nYeah. I I'll tell you what, uh it was\nawfully close this year. Um I've I was\npushed. Uh you know, I think about the\nfirst year that I did it and I rode with\nMark Crayons. Mark is a great athlete\nand uh a very very accomplished\nendurance athlete. Oh, yeah. Um, and and\nthe guy is just strong as heck. And\nriding with him, it was like, this is\nthis is a a legit race on my hands. And\nit it came down to a sprint. Um, and\nknowing that he was more of an endurance\nguy, I felt comfortable being able to\ntake him in the sprint and and lucky for\nme, I was able to. But, um, the second\nyear, um, you know, it was kind of, oh,\nwell, Mark's not here this year. So then\nuh I I got to uh race with Mitch and a\nfew other guys that hung with us for a\nlittle while, but uh Mitch and I broke\naway. And I I think uh the hills kind of\ngot to Mitch and by about mile 40, Mitch\nMitch threw up the white flag and said,\n\"Uh Dan, I'm pretty shocked. If you want\nto keep going on your own, you're more\nthan welcome.\" So hold on hold hold on,\nDan. Uh Mitch, is this how you remember\nthe story? I want to make sure and give\nyou a chance to to pop it there. Yeah.\nUh if there's one thing I can't call Dan\na liar. Um like I said, I don't know if\nyou want to disclose your weight, Dan,\nbut uh you know, it's uh what do we say?\nIt's like 3200 feet in 50 miles and it's\nall short and sharp. So, when you're\nwhen you're a 200lb guy like myself, you\nknow, like like Dan said, there was\nthere was a few attacks uh early on. Um,\nand Dan put one hard one in at the start\nof the truck trail. I think we should\nrename it Peter's Trail or something, I\nsuspect. Uh, I was the only one able to\nkind of go with them. So, him and I, uh,\nkind of laid the gas down through those\nnext, uh, nine miles. Um, feeling pretty\ngood. I think I think Dan may have let\nup on the gas a little bit over the top\na few of them to let me hang in there.\nUm, we got on the short section of road\nand once we hit the long there's a long\nroad climb that goes into the twotrack.\nUh, I was absolutely on the limit and\nsaid, you know, I'm going to hold you\nback. Just go ahead and go ahead and\nsend it. So, you know, one of one of the\ncool things I I like about this race is,\nyou know, Dan and I, you know, we've\nknown each other for many years and, you\nknow, uh, during the summer\nwe summer, Dan, you know, but but we\nride at least once or twice a week\ntogether. So, we've we've known each\nother and raced against each other and\num kind of know each other's uh\nadvantages, we'll say. So, so that so\nit's obvious that the uh kind of that\nthat section that uh Mitch had a little\nbit of trouble with, Dan is a little\nmore suited for that type of terrain. Um\nand then and then what was it? Uh so\nDan, you were by yourself for for the\nend there and then you just finish it\noff by yourself in 2022. Yeah. Yeah. In\n22. Yeah. The about the last 10 miles or\nso, um once Mitch said if if you want to\ngo go, I I went ahead and put power down\non the longer climb and just rode in uh\nby myself. But uh last this last one was\nthis was a little bit more of a test.\nWell, hold on. I mean, so I I appreciate\nthat you started with uh year 1, year\ntwo, because that kind of set the stage\nto maybe what um I don't know if someone\nsay like Mitch had a few friends and\nsaid, \"Hey, I think we can uh we can uh\nhave a few tactics here and maybe this\nis where we beat Dan or this is where we\nbeat Dan.\" Um I don't know. Did\nsomething like that happen this year? Uh\nthat's that's precisely what happened.\nYeah. Um, no, and you know, I the guys\nthat ride in the Green Bay area, um,\nlike Mitch said, we we often ride\ntogether. Um, a lot of the, uh, the\nif we're not on the same team. And, um,\nit really does make for a good cycling\ncommunity. Um, and, you know, we get to\nand his teammates are good at. So, um\npreparing for a race knowing who's going\nto be there, um that's the extra\nelement. And when you're outnumbered, uh\nfour to one, um at at the start line,\nyou just kind of oh boy, you just got to\nswallow and say, \"Here we go.\" Um and\nyeah, I Mitch and his teammates, they\nput together a plan. It was very\nobvious. Um, and that that plan was\nexecuted very well. Um, I want to say\nthe attack started well. I mean, one of\nyour guys, Kurt, he went right away\nright out of the parking lot. He rode\nthe first climb pretty hard and um kind\nof strung things out and then uh next\nthing you know, a couple miles later, we\nstart attack after attack after attack\nand these guys are literally just going\none right after another. Um, and there\nwere a couple of big hay makers in there\nthat uh they went for the knockout\npunch. Um, I I still don't know how I\ncountered every single one of them. Um,\nI I can say I had good legs. I can say I\nI just gained a couple extra watts with\nthe beauty of the the area um and that\ncool, crisp north air. Um, but yeah,\nman, they they pushed me uh to my limit\nuh on some sections of that course. And\nwell, um I do want to bring Mitch into\nthis because this is again this is\nthat's your perspective. Uh Mitch, are\nyou comfortable\num letting us all know what the plans\nwere or what the plan was? Unless you\nwant to try it again next year. I mean,\nyou can maybe uh hold some cards close\nto your chest, but we all know Dan's a\nreal good racer, and it wasn't it wasn't\ngoing to be a surprise. So, yeah, we\nhave a you know, a Pete's Garage group\nchat going and uh you know, the big\nthing is we're all watching\nregistration, you know, dayto day as\nwe're encroaching the ends, like Dan\nsaid, who's racing, right? Uh and we're\nwe're not seeing Dan sign up. We're not\nseeing Dan sign up. And uh you know,\nregistration closes, no Dan Teters,\nright? And uh we we had a guy uh another\nlocal rider races on Dan's team actually\nsend a note said, \"Hey, I forgot to\nregister. Do you can I still sign up?\"\nAnd so I sent James a note and said,\n\"Hey, you know, my buddy Matt wants to\nsign up. Is that cool?\" And he's like,\n\"Yep, yep, no problem. Just show on up\nand uh try to hold Dan's wheel the best\nyou can.\" And I was like, \"Yeah, oh\ngreat.\" So now we know Dan's coming. But\nuh we kind of figured so, you know, it's\na a good race that suits him very well,\nobviously. Um, but yeah, I got uh my\nbuddy Kyle, Kurt, and Nick were there.\nUm, we kind of said, you know, let's\nmake it hard from the start. And any\nopportunity where your legs feel good\nenough, try to take a flyer off the\nfront. Um, you know, we got some pretty\nbig motors, we'll say. And if we can\ncreate a gap, um, even through the\nhills, a few of us, you know, at riding\nyour own pace could likely stay away.\nUm, you know, years ago in the the bear,\nuh, Dan, myself, and another one of my\nteammates, Kyle, the three of us got off\nthe front and, uh, just kind of motored\naway from the group and, um, you know,\nthat's a that's a course that\nsuits a bigger rider a little bit\nbetter, you know, bar a couple technical\nsections that we got to survive on Dan's\nwheel. But, uh, yeah, that was that was\nthe whole thing, you know. Um, attack\nattack. Uh, I sent one pretty early that\nended up uh shelling one of our\nteammates. Um, you know, another one\nNick caught on my our team on Pete's\ngarage there caught my wheel. Um, and I\nthought to myself, this is this is the\nbreak we need. So, me and my buddy Nick\nwere up the road. Um, kind of leading\ninto a a mild climb and I think Dan, you\nmust have worked pretty hard to close\nthat one down. Um because I mean we\nprobably had what 40 yards 50 yards on\nyou and and felt good. Um so Dan closed\nthat one down. Um you know there were a\ncouple other riders uh Bruce from\nMarquette you know I think James that's\none of your friends. You know he was uh\nI think he got second place at single\nspeed this year right real strong rider.\nUh another Dan from from lower down\nstate that uh he ended up closing up\nsome gaps too. Um, but yeah, as soon as\nas soon as Dan was back on the wheel,\nyou know, Kyle took a flyer. Uh, I think\none of the, you know, Bruce kind of\nchased that one down and we just kept\ngoing and going until, uh, you know, it\nwas really the intention to try and get\nKyle up the road. He's probably got the\nbiggest motor out of everybody. So, it\nwas kind of on me to just continually\nattack. So, I kind of uh wrote my own\nticket by by mile 40 that I was going to\nbe gone. But uh no, it was it was\nawesome fun. But And so was there a a\nmoment? I mean, were you trying to get\npast that hilly section around mile 40\nor were you or Kyle, I guess, was your\nwas your go-to person to to really go\nheadto-head with Dan? Um, y was we had\nwe we had two thoughts, you know, if we\ncould soften Dan that he couldn't get\naway from us on the truck trail. Um, we\nlikely could hang till the end. Um, like\nhe said, the the the two track at the\nend's more mountain bike suited and\nthat's Dan's bread and butter, but um,\nwe're technically competent riders. We\nfelt, you know, it's it's flat enough if\nyou can get up the first hill besides\nthe last hill at the end, you can you\ncan hang in there. Um, so we wanted to\nsoften soften his legs by the truck\ntrail. You know, best case is we have\none or two riders, you know, a couple\nminutes up going into the truck trail\nand then just do your best to ride Dan's\nwheel as he tries to to catch up. So,\nand then with all that\nsaid, where where where was the\nselection made? How um Dan, where did\nyou know that you had this uh this race\none?\nOh boy.\nUm I think once we got off the truck\ntrail, um there were there were some\npretty tough sections on that that part\nof the race that I I actually drove\nmyself. Um and Kyle put in a really hard\nattack that I think we were doing about\n35 miles an hour. Um, and once we got\noff of that section and we were together\nas a group of uh group of six, I kind of\nthought it might be okay if I just sit\nin and hang out on the road until we hit\nthe last uh off-road section. Um, but\nreally I just I didn't know what\neverybody else had in the tank. I know\nmy legs were starting to hurt and um it\nwasn't until we made that that initial\nclimb that Mitch had referenced and then\nwe got into that that twotrack where um\nI just I let my mountain bike skills\ntake over and just kind of get up off\nthe saddle a little bit, let the bike\ndance under me. Um and just ride hard.\nUm, and really Kyle was the only one to\nstay on my wheel and uh I thought, boy,\nI'm going to drag him right to the\nfinish and I'm going to get killed in\nthe sprint. Um, but uh we hit a couple\nthere's there's a couple other short\nlittle climbs in there that uh that one\nof them came up and bit Kyle pretty hard\nand it got his hamstring and uh he said\nafter that he's like I just couldn't\npedal for a handful of minutes and um\nthat's really where I got my gap and I\nthink I had almost a minute gap on\neverybody at one point and that was\nenough to to keep me away for the rest\nof the race. So, and that was pretty\nclose to the finish, correct? Yeah, that\nwas uh with at least four or five miles\nto go. Okay.\nYeah. Um that's when that that that kind\nof under the radar. Dan, you're the guy\nyou know there, Dan. What is it?\nCororon. Coranic. Cor. Yep. Yeah. So,\nyeah, he kind of he kind of shot from\nthe back. He he obviously had a bunch in\nthe tank. Um because even like Gel came\ncame over and when he came through\nbecause the top four I got right here.\nUm you know Dan Teters got Corn uh that\nwas 20 25 seconds behind him. Oh wow.\nAnd then Kyle at 32 seconds. So that was\nyou know Dan got him by by 7 seconds on\nsecond place and then um Gestel came\nthrough 40 seconds 43 seconds after. So\nthere was less than a minute on top\nfour. Um so it was close. It was close.\nSo, there wasn't really a necessarily a\ncomfortable gap. Um, there was a gap,\nbut but not super comfortable. Yeah. And\nGel wasn't familiar. He's never pre-roed\nor anything. So, he even said he goes,\n\"Oh, I thought we had like five or six\nmiles left.\" He goes, \"Not that I could\nhave done much, but which I don't\nbelieve, but yeah, he's very first time\nI've raced directly with him, you know.\nI've seen him, you know, at Orore and\nvery, very strong rider. He is nice guy,\ntoo. Yep. He's a cool rider. I love to\nhear these stories, especially with\nlocal races or I mean most of the races\nI do are are smaller local races, but\nyou can still man to to be able to like\ntry out tactics and and to uh I don't be\npart of that competition and just it's\nit's it's just great. I mean, I I love\nthat to hear that, you know, it it\ndoesn't matter if it's um I don't know,\nUnbound versus Well, probably unbound\nwould be even almost impossible to to be\nable to implement something like this,\nlike what you did um last weekend. And\nthis gives you the opportunity to play\naround, have fun, know the other riders,\nknow the course, and it just makes it\nway more enjoyable.\nWell, I'll tell you what, Trevor. This\nand this kind of goes back to your\ncomment about it being a 50 mile race\nand kind of where's that sweet spot? And\nyou know, I think with the gravel races\nand so many races being longer events,\nyou know,\nthose I don't want to say they're not\nraces because they're races, but how\nracy can you be? And what I really enjoy\nis those those distances where you can\nthrow attacks, you can be aggressive,\nyou know, you you have to have a\nstrategy. You have to have a strategy\noutside of I just got to conserve\nfor 100 miles and and wait for something\nto happen. Yeah. Yeah. you know, so you\nknow, I think that that sweet spot, you\nknow, between 50 and and 80 miles or so,\nI think that's it's such a good distance\nfor this kind of racing. Um, you know,\nit allows you to be aggressive if if you\nif you want to go that route. You can\nstill ride conservative, but the race\nitself, it just is so much more\ninteresting than just sitting on each\nother's wheel all day and just trying to\nwork together to get to the finish.\nyou're you're actually you're trying to\nshell people off your wheel and it it\nit's more of a race. It's more it's it's\nmore of a race and less of just a\nstraight out suffer fest and who can\nsuffer the longest and that's and that\nis what some of these longer races have\nkind of turned into. Uh Mitch, on this\nside of it, is there anything that maybe\nyou and your teammates or your friends\nwould do differently next year? Um just\nstop listening, Dan. Um yeah, put that\non mute. There you go.\nAll but I guess like for this year, do\nyou think that there's something you\ncould have done a little better or was\nit just uh the the stronger man won?\nUh yeah, the stronger man won for sure.\nUm, I think having Bruce and Dan there,\nBruce especially, he closed some some\npretty good gaps. Um, you know, hard to,\nyou know, he obviously earned earned his\nposition. Um, the easy answer is bring\nmore friends.\nUh, like I said, uh, that we could lay\nmore attacks.\nUm, no, I was pretty pretty happy with\nthe race, frankly. Um, I think, uh, we\nhad a fun time. We executed a plan. You\nknow, ultimately, um, we figured if,\nlike I said, if we could be with Dan in\nthe group at the end of the truck trail,\nwe could get into the last section and\njust let it play out. You know, Dan was\nkind and and didn't mention my my last\nfeeble attack to to try and break his uh\nbreak his spirit there. But, uh, yeah, I\nI got up the hill and I figured if I\ncould get up the hill, you know, maybe\nthey'll catch me and I can hang in\nthere. But, everybody flew past me. I\nwas I was out of out of gas.\nUm but uh now now in all honesty, Mitch,\nuh knowing that you were dangling just\noff of us on the truck trail uh and you\nmade contact again, I was really\nimpressed, but I knew your legs were\ndead. So when you made that last effort\non the road, I was not worried. I did\nnot see a reason to go chase it down,\nand I knew that we would do the damage\non the next tough section. So this is\nthe this is like brings in like the\nbenefit of knowing who's riding against\nyou and then the uh the not benefit of\nthe person riding against you knowing\nyou really well too. Yep. Yep. Exactly.\nYou know, we were on a on a road\nsection. So I I looked back and I saw\nDan was I don't know what do you think\neight yards behind me. You were I think\nyou might have been second wheel. So, I\njust opened it up and, you know, I I\nopened up what do you think 25 30\nseconds at the bottom of the hill, you\nknow, got up to the top. Um, Dan came\naround me uh right at the very peak of\nit. So, I I stood on it and they they\nwere just had an extra gear versus what\nI had. But, uh, yeah, it was\ninteresting. So, like I said, we we put\na tax in on the the the truck trail. So,\nI ended up getting dropped with maybe\ntwo miles to go on the truck trail, but\nnever never lost more than 45 seconds.\nAnd as soon as we hit a flat road, just\nmotortored back up and got the group\nback\ntogether. So, if there's anything James\nwants to do to flatten the course, that\nwould be okay. Maybe that would\nhelp. That'll work for the county\nanymore. Ah, yeah. See there? Get a get\na big truck through there. But\nit was it was awesome course this year.\nLast year it was a little bit soft like\nthey had they had graded it. It seemed\nlike maybe two weeks prior. Um it didn't\nreally firm up or set up, but this year\nthere was a ton of hard pack lines. Um\nwhen I was marking it, I was really\nexcited to see that knowing that the\npace would pick up a little bit. Um I\ndidn't go down the truck trail in my my\nvehicle. I didn't have the time to be\nable to pull that off, but the truck\ntrail is a truck trail. Um, but I really\nI did, you know, going back to like me\nand my buddy Bruce standing there\nlistening to you guys kind of go back\nand forth about your strategy and stuff.\nI just loved it when, you know, Mitch\ngoes, you know, we attacked. I was like,\nwhere at? And he goes, the whole time.\nThat's I looked at my Strava data and\nyou could see, you know, your spike in\nyour power. And over the course of\nwhatever 45 minutes in the middle of the\nrace, I had like 24 separate times where\nI tried to go, you know. So, like I\nsaid, we in in between Kyle, you know,\nKyle's trying to conserve a little bit\nof energy. Um, you know, our our other\npartner Nick that kind of made it up the\nroad with us, he's he's a bigger dude,\ntoo. And I don't know if Dan noticed, he\nwas kind of hanging off the back for for\nmost of it. So, uh, kind of tried to be\nthe best teammate I could and just keep\ngoing. Just keep going. So, I I think I\nactually rode about half that race\nlooking over my shoulder.\nYep. Yep. Just waiting. That's great.\nSee, if we if we made Dan nervous,\nthat's a win for us. Me personally, you\nknow. Well, I think there's something to\nbe said about um even if the tactics\ndidn't work correctly, knowing that you\ndid as much as you could and that's\nwhat's it's tough about like maybe\nkeeping a little in the tank or knowing\nthat there's something that you maybe\nyou attacked too much and but um\nthinking that you did it right and uh\nDan just overcame. I mean, I think\nthat's that's a really cool story. And\nit's also I mean, it's it's really cool\nto hear both perspectives and then also\njust the just the pure like fun\nsportsmanship between the two of you. I\nmean, it's not like it it you wanted to\nbeat Dan, but I don't feel like it was\nuh anything personal. Oh, no. No,\nabsolutely not. Like I said, we've been\non plenty of training rides together\nwhere we've beat each other up and\nwaited and and and lots of stuff. So,\nit's always fun. Yeah, that's fantastic.\nUm, I I appreciate this and uh I I'm\ngoing to going to wrap it up here in a\nsecond, but I do want to ask all of you\nabout um I feel it's important to talk\nabout maybe what's on the other side\nfrom the pointy end of the race. Um, I'm\nassuming that there's plenty of\nparticipants, racers, riders that come\nto this event that don't care at all\nabout tactics and riding hard. James, do\nyou think that there's still something\nuh to offer those who just want to go up\nand appreciate that area this time of\nyear? Like definitely like do you are\nare you Yeah. Yeah. Talk about that.\nYeah. I mean that that's basically the\nthe whole idea from the start is you\nknow I'm I'm not a racer nor will I ever\nbe able to be a racer and I'm fine with\nthat because I put it like even last\nyear at Moran I I did the 66 and and I\nwas like all right I'm just going to\nhold on to the fastest group I can hold\non to and I was able to do that for\nabout an hour at 18 miles an hour and\nand I just I've never experienced\nanything like that like um pain-wise and\nI was like well this you know I'm just I\ndon't think I'll ever be there. Um, but\nit's the ride for me and then to create\na race to where you can create some some\ncompetition because I I love the gravel\nstrategy and camaraderie. Um, and that's\nbeen my favorite part of the gravel\nscene. Um, you know, especially at the\nat the head, you know, the start finish\nline, being able to hang out and then to\nsee a group come in and like you were\nsaying, there's there's no animosity.\num it you know people are doing their\nstrategies out there having fun with it\neven these elite guys um it's just super\ncool and then you know attracting it's\njust kind of cool to especially it being\nan Iron Mountain like you said it's a\nlittle bit disconnected from lower\nMichigan um but it you know at some\npoint it kind of ties all the way around\nto Wisconsin you know especially looking\nat the heat maps registration just goes\nalmost straight down to Chicago for us\num and then we get a couple blips from\nlower Michigan Um, but it it still ties,\nyou know, the upper peninsula racers to\nsome some new racers out of Green Bay\nand and even further south and a couple\nfrom, you know, out west a little bit.\nUh, so it's kind of cool to see it just\nkind of collaborate a little bit because\nespecially the MA Michigan gravel scene,\nyou know, I I've always just been super\ninto that and and love, you know, all\nthese local people and just kind of\nunder the radar. uh you know, even like\nWakeley and stuff like that. You know,\nit it would be really cool to like see,\nyou know, some some more people from\ndownstate Michigan come over and kind of\ngo headto-head with these Wisconsin\nfolk. Yeah. Yeah.\nWe could learn what real suffering feels\nlike. I don't know. There's strong\npeople everywhere, that's for sure. Um\nYeah. Well, this is this is great. I uh\nI feel like this was a huge benefit for\nme to hear more about the lone wolf and\njust know I don't know like I said it\nwas just maybe it's just the distance\nand and not being uh close to it but it\ndefinitely seems like something I want\nto experience and like you said like the\ncamaraderie and the\nthe everything you're telling me it\nseems like what I would like to\nexperience in a in a true gravel race\nand and I think that you're you're\nyou're hitting the nail on the head\nthere and and I hope it continues. And\num and yeah, real quick, I was I was\ngoing to ask you guys, has weather been\ngood each year? Because I feel like that\ntime of year you can I mean, it's it's a\nreal crapshoot. I was just thinking, I'd\nlove to go up there, but then I'm like,\nwell, if the weather sucks, I'm not even\ngoing to worry about it.\nI mean, year one, uh it it was rainy,\nbut the the temperature was real good.\nOkay. Um, so it it was wet and actually\nit kind of firmed up the course, kept it\nkept it really nice. Um, year two,\nsunny, cool, just the epitome of fall\ngravel. You know, I think we started in\nthe 30s, maybe ended in the high30s and\nmid-40s. It was it was lovely. And then,\nuh, this year was kind of a mix of\neverything. You know, we saw sun, we had\nsprinkles, a little bit of puddles. It\nwas it was great. So kind of, you know,\njust uh to go to go back to your\nprevious comment, you know, about coming\nup and doing the race, you know, Iron\nMountains building a lot of mountain\nbike trails. You know, James and a lot\nof his friends and family have had a lot\nto do with it. You know, you could you\ncould really make a weekend of it. You\nknow, come ride a lot of really fun,\nvaried trails, and then race, ride your\nbike on a on a Sunday. Yeah, that sounds\nfantastic. Yeah. Thank you guys. Thank\nyou. uh just for I mean talking about\nthe race um your experience uh the\ntactics which sounded like a lot of fun\nand and James thank you for kind of kind\nof putting this together putting the\nrace together and and getting us all in\nthe same uh Zoom room. Um this is really\ncool to hear this story. We were I was\ndiscussing it with my buddy Bruce Lang\nand he's like man you know what we\noverheard those guys talking about would\nmake a really good podcast. And I was\nlike, he goes, \"Do you know any?\" And I\nwas like, \"Well, kind of know Trevor and\nyou know, it would kind of be an honor\nto to see if you had time and I really\nappreciate you getting us on there\nbecause, you know, like I said, this\nthat story kind of had to be told,\nespecially this year, um, with what was\ngoing on up front there. It I wish I\ncould have put a a a water bottle on the\nbike to listen to it all going on.\"\nWell, cool. Um, do you guys uh you guys\nget on this side of the of the state at\nall for any races or you stick mainly in\nthe up?\nYeah. No, I've been over uh what did I\ndo? I did uh Barrier Bay last year.\nOkay. Um and that was we had some snow\nand some pretty inclement weather for\nthat one. Oh yeah. Um, and uh, but you\nknow, I I compare that race to to Lone\nWolf and outside of the kind of the same\nsharp kind of steep climbs. Um, that\nthat's like hero dirt over there versus\nsome of the chunky stuff we we have in\nthis race. Um, but the level of\ncompetition there is just through the\nroof, you know. Um, so yeah, I mean some\nof the races down in the the lower lower\nside of Michigan, God, I'd love to get\nover there and do some of those gravel\nraces. I wish we had a series like that\nhere in Wisconsin, but um maybe one day.\nYeah. Yeah. Well, I I'll definitely have\nto make my way over on that side. Uh\nMitch, you mentioned uh or to shore. You\ndo you do or shore or uh Yep. Yep. Done\nit a number of years. Yep. managed uh\nsecond single speed this year. So Oh\nwow, man. Sounds like Who doesn't do or\nto shore? I mean, really. That's true.\nIf if you're from the Midwest. Yeah,\nthat's true. That's true. I I love that\nrace. That's such a good event. Yeah.\nWell, so I've done it the last couple\nyears. And I I'll be there every year if\nI can. So hopefully uh hopefully next\nyear we can uh link up. And what is it?\nThis little right. Oh, there you go.\nNice.\n[Laughter]\nJust Yeah, just so you know, for two, I\nkeep keep her right at the desk.\nThere it is. 22.\nGreat guys. I'll let you uh get back to\nwork unfortunately, but um thanks for\njumping on and telling your story and\nyeah, really appreciate it. I appreciate\nyour time, Trevor. It was fun. Thanks.\nYep.
