Derek Yarra finished the 100-miler in 6h24m, nearly an hour behind winner Tobin Ortenblad's 5h24m time. The course delivers \"80% dirt\" for the century with \"a perfect blend of pavement, dirt road, gravel road and historic railroad grade.\" Similar distance to Crusher in the Tushar."

        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Derek Yarra captures the technical reality: \"As soon as the pavement ended, and the doubletrack dirt roads started, carnage ensued. Soft, sandy sections stalled unsuspecting racers, and the inevitable collisions happened.\" Official guidance recommends \"at least 40mm wide tires\" citing \"lots of rocks and rain ruts crossing the dirt road sections,\" while riders report rim strikes from rocky creek bed crossings. Similar technical demands to Gravel Worlds."

      "elevation": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Starting at nearly 5,000 feet with 6,000 feet of climbing creates substantial Sierra Nevada consequences. The course winds through \"forested valleys, canyons, high-Sierra peaks\" with three timed segments including the \"Grizzly Grind uphill.\" Race organizers have historically shifted dates to accommodate snow melt at higher elevations, confirming this gets properly vertical. More climbing than SBT GRVL at the same score."

        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Historical weather data shows average highs of 79°F and lows of 48°F, with a 19% chance of rain on any given day. Conditions swing from velodromedary's 2023 experience of \"very dry, dusty and in places, rutted course\" to John Watson's 2025 encounter with \"moon dust\" conditions and \"silty washouts.\" Early June Sierra weather remains unpredictable enough that riders worry about \"snow, or at the very least mud in places where snow has recently melted.\" Similar climate challenges to SBT GRVL."

      "altitude": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Starting at nearly 5,000 feet adds complexity without creating serious high-altitude racing consequences. The Sierra elevation will slow your times and make the 6,000 feet of climbing more demanding, especially for sea-level riders, but you're not dealing with true oxygen-debt territory that requires specialized preparation. Modest altitude compared to Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

      "adventure": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Lost Sierra backcountry through ranchlands, mountain lakes, and Forest Service roads delivers remote terrain at serious elevation. Photographer John Watson documents the Dixie Fire's aftermath: \"massive expanse\" of burned forest now carpeted with \"Sierra lupine, Snow Plant, Mule Ears\" creating \"swathes of color.\" The 80% dirt ratio means wilderness racing with cell service concerns, not sanitized rail-trail touring."
      },

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Three-time pro winner Serena Gordon calls it \"sort of the reason we ride and race bikes\" and praises the \"amazing landscape and amazing terrain.\" The race joined the Gravel Earth Series in 2025 with a global prize purse, but field depth remains thin enough for Gordon to dominate repeatedly, suggesting regional respect without national marquee status."
      },
      "race_quality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Aid stations run by \"Scout troops, WTB, PAUL, Patagonia\" provide \"cold cans of Coke, sweet and savory delights.\" However, photographer John Watson captures safety challenges: \"medics crowded around someone at the base of a pine tree, applying pressure to a chin wound\" alongside multiple mechanicals including \"broken wheel, snapped chain, slipped bars.\" Remote terrain creates management difficulties."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Over 80% dirt through Lost Sierra backcountry, ranchlands, and forested valleys delivers adventure terrain. Starting at nearly 5,000 feet with 6,000 feet of climbing creates real consequence and reward. The weekend festival format with shuttle service to Lake Davis shows they're trying to create more than just a race, even if the execution feels rough around the edges."

        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Serena Gordon emphasizes \"the way the community embraces the event, and everyone's so nice, and the festival.\" Founded on Chris McGovern's 2014 pitch that \"recreation is a resource\" for Sierra towns surviving on \"dregs of a slowing lumber industry,\" the event supports Sierra Buttes Trail Stewardship's trail building mission with locals getting $50 discounts."

        "explanation": "With a field of 200-400 riders, serena Gordon winning three times tells you everything about the competitive depth — when the same rider dominates repeatedly, the field isn't stacked. No prize purse and no mention of notable pros beyond Gordon and Mike Shaw suggests this draws enthusiasts, not elite competition. The 'worldwide' marketing claim feels like counting anyone who drove more than three hours to get there. Less competitive depth than Almanzo 100. As Derek Yarra puts it: \"I crossed the line 25th in the pro field with a time of 6h24m.\""

The race supports Sierra Buttes Trail Stewardship, which has built 216 miles of singletrack and maintained 2,869 miles of existing trail since 2003, providing meaningful cause alignment but unclear participant value proposition."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Registration runs $80-120. Remote Portola location at 5,000 feet elevation means significant travel costs with limited lodging options in a small Sierra town. Officials recommend \"at least 40mm wide tires\" and suggest \"light, fast rigid mountain bike with 2.0 tires,\" potentially requiring specific equipment purchases for the rocky, rutted Forest Service terrain. Higher total cost than Badlands."

          "transcript": "in Portolo, California this morning. I'm\nout here gonna run the Lost and Found\ngravel race course. I think there's a\n30, a 60, and a 100 if I'm not mistaken.\nSo, I'm going to go run the 97 milei\ncourse cuz it's not really 100.\nCurrently, it says the route is 97 mi\nlong with 6,322\nft of elevation.\nOut here solo on a Monday.\nEverybody else is on the other side of\nthe mountains riding something else\ntoday and figured I'd just come through\nwith a little course recon. See what we\ncan uh see for this course and give you\nguys some insight. Let's get it. Here we\ngo. This is the technically the start\nright at this little park.\nGoes back into town.\n[music]\nStarting off spicy.\n86 miles in\non the road. Hits a big climb.\nDon't burn too many watts on a big day.\nGoing off from the start.\nWow.\n2 miles in, the views just hit you. Woo!\nCurrently at mile 2.8 according to the\nclimb profile. I'm on climb number two\nwith 2.7 miles of this climb to go. 825\nft to climb on a 3enter and it looks\nlike it kicks up.\nSame climb. Mile four gets steep. Mile\nand a half left on this. Currently on a\n9%.\nLooks like it's going to punch up a\nlittle more. and just made it into the\nnational forest.\nOkay, where's the dirt?\nStill on that same climb. Number two of\n16,000 ft of elevation in the first 5\nmiles. Probably not the best idea to\nblow your wad right off the gate.\nHeat. Heat.\n8 miles in, we made it to the dirt.\nIt's actually 8.4 if you really want to\nknow. Had a rip and descent, a hidden\nlefthand turn.\nBig dirty climb on 8 miles, huh? Those\nviews are stunning though.\n12% or less than a mile of it left to\ngo. Expect that before n mile 9 into\nnine.\nHey,\nhey, hey.\nWoo!\nSo good.\nAnd we're only 10 minute and a [music]\nhalf in.\nBack on some road after a ripening\ndescent. 11 and a half miles in. 1,700\nft climb so far.\nMile 14 and a half. We're back on the\ngravel washboards.\nMile 19. We got some primo gravel.\nLook at this.\nAll right, little ride update. I am 20\nmi in 1,897\nft climbed. So yeah,\nquite a bit of climbing in that first\nsection. Honestly, I think most of the\nclimbing was just getting out of town\nbefore the dirt and then the big climb\nafter the lake. Absolutely gorgeous.\nYeah, I say start off slow unless you\nreally got that uh stamina in the first\npart of the race, first 15 miles of the\nrace.\nI don't know. It's quite a bit of\nclimbing. The views are\namazing. That's just uh that doesn't\neven describe the views. That's just uh\nmy small vocabulary.\nThey are absolutely stunning out here.\nOkay, let's keep it tricking.\nmile. 25. Climb number five. Half mile\nclimb left with 112 ft of climbing.\nCurrently 4%. Looks like it spikes up a\nlittle bit. So, a little bit more of a\nmellow one.\nAll right, this climb's a little chunky.\n30 mi in. This valley has a brutal\nheadwind. Currently at mile 30, 2,510 ft\nclimbed. 2 hours in. Just battling a\ngood old headwind now.\nWow, that was super deep.\nJust a big old empty windy valley. It's\npretty though, but I don't like wind.\nMile 33. Just hit a big old climb. I'm\non the 4% part, but the next part I'm\nlooking at don't look very small. Okay,\nso this is climb six of 16. 2.7 miles\nfor this one with 650 ft of gain.\nAnd it's kind of loose gravel. This is\ngoing to be a good one. It like it\nspikes up right here, then dips down,\nthen climbs like mellow again.\n10% on the chunky bit.\nI'm out of gears.\ncame across a father and daughter out\nhere also reconing the course. She looks\nto be riding the whole thing and he's\ndriving up to a certain point, stopping,\nhopping on his bike, riding back to her,\nand then riding back to the car like\nleaprogging type thing. Pretty cool.\nNice people. H God, it is so pretty out\nhere.\nApproaching 3,000 ft climbed.\n35 miles in. Almost over the halfway\npoint of climbing. 2900 in.\nleft. Not bad. Almost at 6,000 ft of\nelevation.\nIt's a little toasty on this side. Climb\nnumber six is brutal. Still making my\nway on 11enter right now. Almost to the\ntop. It's definitely more exposed\nand the wind gets kind of cut off it\nfeels like. So feel like you're in the\noven. That's a good one. That's for\nsure. Yeah. 44 more feet of elevation\ngain 19 miles to go on this. Okay. Can't\nwait to get to the top. Please let there\nbe some good downhill after this one.\nOkay. made it to the top of that climb,\nbut there's apparently some sharp rocks\nor something cuz I just got a puncture.\nTop of the climb is mile 36 and a half.\nYeah, look at this. Just the rocks just\nsticking in it. Yeah, I think that's it.\n[snorts]\nFilled itself. So hopefully we should be\ngood.\nHeat. Heat. N.\nNice little water crossing at mile 41.\nCurrently at mile 41, just under 3\nhours, 56 miles to go. I've done 3,389\nfeet of climbing and it looks like 2,933\nft to go. We're at least over the hump\nof climbing. [music]\nMile 51.\n3,87\nft climb so far in this beautiful\nvalley. I can see this long road.\nJust looks like it goes forever.\nPretty incredible,\nthat's for sure.\nquite windy which is uh taking a toll on\nme but\nyou know halfway through so it's all\ngood. I will uh look forward to getting\nout of this valley. Hopefully\nfind somewhere that has a little bit\nsmoother rolling and less wind.\nOh boy.\nOkay.\nAll right.\nThat glorious water crossing is at mile\n52.\nWasn't too hard, but there's definitely\nsome uh sharp big rocks in that one.\nGo\ngo go go go.\nHeat.\n60 mi in right next to this beautiful\nlake. 4,055\nft of climbing. Currently,\n4 hours in. I will say this last section\nall the way up to this lake. Lots of\nloose small gravel. Some slow parts too,\nbut yeah, very loose.\nLittle bit slow.\nno go no go no go no go no go no go no\ngo no go no go no go no\n[music] go go.\n71 miles in. Whatever this little road\nis they routed us on over here is like\nfeels like a little sneaky locals back\nroad or something. Just going through\nsome random little properties. It's kind\nof rough. It's kind of out of the way. I\ndon't know. It's pretty cool. 4796\nft climbed.\nStill got a little bit to do.\nmile 76 and back on some pavement. Oh\nman, that is very welcome to be on some\npavement after that last section. There\nwas just a lot of climbing and then some\nsand, some technical little descents and\nclimbs with some chunky rocks. Yeah, it\njust kind of felt like it was never\nending. And I think I ran out of water\nat mile 70. So\nyeah, I'm looking for a watering hole\nnow or just going to send it all the way\nback with no water. 5,143\nWe getting there. We getting there.\nWell, that road section didn't last very\nlong. Maybe a mile. [snorts]\nIt's all good, though. All good, though.\nIt's so pretty. So pretty out here.\nWe're getting 21 miles to go.\nMaybe all [music] I can do is try\nto find [music]\nthe ghost inside.\nMaybe there's no other way.\non the never ending final climb.\n[panting]\nI've got a mile left of it and 221 more\nfeet to go. Mile 84.\nSo done.\nI am uh pretty well cracked. [gasps]\n12 miles to go. I'm almost certain that\nit's all downhill from here. It's mostly\ndownhill from here. There's 213 ft left\nin this route to climb. So, I'm excited.\nThe downhill does not look fast. It\nlooks like it's very\nchunky. Somewhat technical.\nI just want to stop. Look at this view,\nthough.\nLittle town down there or whatever it\nis.\nYeah.\nOkay,\nbig big chunky descent. Let's call this\na day.\nghost inside.\nmile 88 and a half back on the road.\nThat descent to the road sucked.\nI'm going to be 100% honest. That really\nsucks. like that kind of takes away from\nhow good the course was.\nI don't know. I don't want to be\nThat's the last thing I want to deal\nwith towards the end of a race. The big\nold chunky descent that is randomly\nlying you loose.\nThat kind of really put me off. I'm not\ninto that. Not at all. All right. Nice\nlittle road\ndownhill back.\nThank you.\nMile 96 on the rec trail.\nThat is the lost and found gravel\ncourse recon.\n97.71\nmi,\n5,977\nft climbed, 7 hours and 14 minutes.\nFinal notes,\nI did end up with a couple punctures.\nLuckily, they sealed, so be prepared.\nCome with flat repair kits, extra tubes,\nsealant plugs, all that fun stuff.\nSecond tip,\nI was on 2.1 tires. I would not ride\nanything smaller than a 45. Honestly, a\n45 might be pushing it, especially for\nthat crappy last descent.\n2.1's work good on the rest of it.\n[sighs and gasps]\nAnd all that loose gravel, some sand,\nand the other stuff absolutely cracked.\nHope y'all enjoyed that. Like, comment,\nsubscribe. I'll do it again some other\ntime.",

(Spoiler: we didn’t.)\n\nFrom flat bars to drop bars, wide tires to wishful thinking — everyone was cracked by the end. But Lost and Found isn’t just about suffering (even though we did). It’s about the stories, the finish line high-fives, and the excuse to eat burritos in the dirt with friends.\n\n🎥 In this video:\n🚴 A look at the route and conditions\n⚙️ Real talk about bike setup and gear choices\n🥵 Honest vibes from a brutally fun day out\n🍕 Post-ride snacks and camping hangs\n\nWould we do it again?\n100% maybe.\n\n👉 Subscribe for more gravel events, gear reviews, and behind-the-scenes footage from the Ornot team.\n\n#LostAndFoundGravel #GravelRacing #BikeAdventure #OrnotBike #GravelGrinder #PortolaCA #CyclingLife",

          "transcript": "That was really hard. That was really\nhard. That was by far the hardest it's\never been. I did not have the best day.\nThat was not fun at all. That feel\nThere you go.\nEach year, Polla, California hosts the\nLost and Found Gravel Grinder. We've\nbeen here for the past 10 years for a\nweekend of camping, being outdoors, and\nof course, riding bikes. It's part\nreunion, part bike race, and all fun. Or\nso we thought. The route consisted of 96\nmiles, 8,000 ft of climbing, and the\nbike choice was at the top of everyone's\nmind. Drop bars, flat bars, tire choice,\ngearing. Would we choose the right bike\nor not? You don't have any dirt on your\nvibe check. Uh, I am so glad to be done.\nSo glad to be done. I died a million\ntimes out there. Just very dead. And\nthen a little bit of resurrection and\nthen just dead again. It finished with a\nheadwind. Just headwind for a long time.\nDid you make the right tire choice? No,\nI got a flat. You got a flat. Look it.\nLook at those on the like extra extra\nsuperduty or almost super duty. What do\nyou have changed with your bike setup? I\nhad to put oily lube on my chain. my wax\nlike got all rubby and hard and uh I had\nto just go full on like put the oil on.\nI think I need to do inserts in my tires\nbecause I pinched obviously. Show me in\nyour eyes how you feel in your soul\nright now. Feel feel\ndead. Yeah, there you go. Good. Yeah,\nthat's it. Dude, I was just broken out\nthere. Respect, dude. I mean, it's all\nit's all good now that I'm done, but\nmedium good. Medium good. That was\nreally hard. It was really hard. Very\nhard. Started out great.\nAnd unlike the last time I did this,\nlast time I did this, I blew up at mile\n85.\nToday, I decided to blow up at mile 70\njust to make the last 25 miles that much\nmore fun. The middle climb and the\nheadwind can eat a bag of you know\nwhats. How was your setup? Zero\ncomplaints. Yeah. You wouldn't change\nanything? Nope. Everyone told me I\nshould be on bigger tires. Everyone told\nme a mountain bike is better. But when\nthis is the This is when this is the\nbike you got. It's the bike you run and\nyou make it work. What is the dollar\namount that it would take for you\nto have a beer and then do that again\nright now?\nNo dollar amount. No dollar amount. Beer\nfor sure. Not doing it again right now.\nI like sleep and showers,\nthings of that nature. Not even for a\nmillion dollars. All right. Couldn't do\nit. Couldn't do it. Validation because I\njust lay down and die. Yeah.\nOh, hey. Oh, hey. Hi.\nWas a day. I've done this race four or\nfive times and that was by far the\nhardest it's ever been. the like sketchy\ndescents on the first half. Those were\nreally fun. Uh, would you change\nanything about your bike? Absolutely\nnot. Just myself. More fitness. What is\nthe dollar amount that it would take for\nyou to eat a burrito and then do it\nagain right now? I can't even comprehend\nthat. I ate probably 10 bacon wrap\npickles and then sat there for a minute\nand I was like, \"Okay, I guess I can\nkeep doing this.\" I got there and like\nCam greeted me and gave me a big hug.\nHe's like, \"What do you need?\" I was\nlike, \"New legs?\" He's like, \"Well, you\ndon't want mine.\" And then I just sat\nthere chatting with him for a while and\njust\nbacon and pickles.\nI didn't think that was going to take 8\nhours today.\nWe had a good time. I mean, now I'm\nexcited to get a beer and try to forget\nabout that. Uh, would you change your\nbike set up? We never saw you. Yeah.\nSuspension. uh all of the suspension.\nThere were some pretty parts, the single\ntrack, which there's very little left.\nWe looked at the uh yeah, I mean it was\nit was a good time. Katie and I had uh\nwe had the worst time of our lives, but\nwe had it together. I don't know why I'm\nlaughing. Assuming that you have lights\nand food, what is that dollar amount?\nThat's asking how much my life is worth\ncuz I would die.\nWell, uh, $100.\nOkay, I'll give you $100. Let's see it.\n1 million trillion dollars. Get it? Do\nyou get it? Do you get the reference?\nYou get it? Never. Never seen it. No\nidea what you're talking about. Jokes\naside, these events are about more than\nhow you feel at the end of a hard bike\nride. It's the stories you can tell.\nIt's the friends, food, and the weekend\nas a whole. Even if we were a little\ntired after the race, did we have a good\ntime? Yes. Will we need more fitness\nnext year? Absolutely. And will we come\nback? 100% yes.\n[Music]",
