Derek Yarra finished the 100-miler in 6h24m, nearly an hour behind winner Tobin Ortenblad's 5h24m time. The course delivers \"80% dirt\" for the century with \"a perfect blend of pavement, dirt road, gravel road and historic railroad grade.\" Similar distance to Crusher in the Tushar."

      "technicality": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Derek Yarra captures the technical reality: \"As soon as the pavement ended, and the doubletrack dirt roads started, carnage ensued. Soft, sandy sections stalled unsuspecting racers, and the inevitable collisions happened.\" Official guidance recommends \"at least 40mm wide tires\" citing \"lots of rocks and rain ruts crossing the dirt road sections,\" while riders report rim strikes from rocky creek bed crossings. Similar technical demands to Gravel Worlds."

      "elevation": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Starting at nearly 5,000 feet with 6,000 feet of climbing creates substantial Sierra Nevada consequences. The course winds through \"forested valleys, canyons, high-Sierra peaks\" with three timed segments including the \"Grizzly Grind uphill.\" Race organizers have historically shifted dates to accommodate snow melt at higher elevations, confirming this gets properly vertical. More climbing than SBT GRVL at the same score."

        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Historical weather data shows average highs of 79°F and lows of 48°F, with a 19% chance of rain on any given day. Conditions swing from velodromedary's 2023 experience of \"very dry, dusty and in places, rutted course\" to John Watson's 2025 encounter with \"moon dust\" conditions and \"silty washouts.\" Early June Sierra weather remains unpredictable enough that riders worry about \"snow, or at the very least mud in places where snow has recently melted.\" Similar climate challenges to SBT GRVL."

      "altitude": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Starting at nearly 5,000 feet adds complexity without creating serious high-altitude racing consequences. The Sierra elevation will slow your times and make the 6,000 feet of climbing more demanding, especially for sea-level riders, but you're not dealing with true oxygen-debt territory that requires specialized preparation. Modest altitude compared to Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

      "adventure": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Lost Sierra backcountry through ranchlands, mountain lakes, and Forest Service roads delivers remote terrain at serious elevation. Photographer John Watson documents the Dixie Fire's aftermath: \"massive expanse\" of burned forest now carpeted with \"Sierra lupine, Snow Plant, Mule Ears\" creating \"swathes of color.\" The 80% dirt ratio means wilderness racing with cell service concerns, not sanitized rail-trail touring."
      },
      "prestige": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Three-time pro winner Serena Gordon calls it \"sort of the reason we ride and race bikes\" and praises the \"amazing landscape and amazing terrain.\" The race joined the Gravel Earth Series in 2025 with a global prize purse, but field depth remains thin enough for Gordon to dominate repeatedly, suggesting regional respect without national marquee status."
      },
      "race_quality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Aid stations run by \"Scout troops, WTB, PAUL, Patagonia\" provide \"cold cans of Coke, sweet and savory delights.\" However, photographer John Watson captures safety challenges: \"medics crowded around someone at the base of a pine tree, applying pressure to a chin wound\" alongside multiple mechanicals including \"broken wheel, snapped chain, slipped bars.\" Remote terrain creates management difficulties."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Over 80% dirt through Lost Sierra backcountry, ranchlands, and forested valleys delivers adventure terrain. Starting at nearly 5,000 feet with 6,000 feet of climbing creates real consequence and reward. The weekend festival format with shuttle service to Lake Davis shows they're trying to create more than just a race, even if the execution feels rough around the edges."

      "community": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Serena Gordon emphasizes \"the way the community embraces the event, and everyone's so nice, and the festival.\" Founded on Chris McGovern's 2014 pitch that \"recreation is a resource\" for Sierra towns surviving on \"dregs of a slowing lumber industry,\" the event supports Sierra Buttes Trail Stewardship's trail building mission with locals getting $50 discounts."
      },

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "With a field of 200-400 riders, serena Gordon winning three times tells you everything about the competitive depth — when the same rider dominates repeatedly, the field isn't stacked. No prize purse and no mention of notable pros beyond Gordon and Mike Shaw suggests this draws enthusiasts, not elite competition. The 'worldwide' marketing claim feels like counting anyone who drove more than three hours to get there. Less competitive depth than Almanzo 100. As Derek Yarra puts it: \"I crossed the line 25th in the pro field with a time of 6h24m.\""

The race supports Sierra Buttes Trail Stewardship, which has built 216 miles of singletrack and maintained 2,869 miles of existing trail since 2003, providing meaningful cause alignment but unclear participant value proposition."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Registration runs $80-120. Remote Portola location at 5,000 feet elevation means significant travel costs with limited lodging options in a small Sierra town. Officials recommend \"at least 40mm wide tires\" and suggest \"light, fast rigid mountain bike with 2.0 tires,\" potentially requiring specific equipment purchases for the rocky, rutted Forest Service terrain. Higher total cost than Badlands."
