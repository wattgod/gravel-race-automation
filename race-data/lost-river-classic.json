      "summary": "The Lost River Classic doesn't pretend to be something it isn't. This is grassroots West Virginia gravel at its core: 85 miles of constant climbing through humid forest roads, rocky descents that punish mistakes, and August heat that compounds every effort. You won't find prize purses or Instagram influencers here. You'll find 250 regional riders who showed up to suffer together and support trail advocacy. The course delivers legitimate challenge—8,500 feet of elevation isn't a typo—but the real test is managing heat stress during 6-8 hours of constant work. Aid stations are 30 miles apart. Cell service is spotty. If something goes wrong, you problem-solve or walk out. That's the deal. If you want a well-produced national event with all the amenities, look elsewhere. If you want authentic Appalachian gravel racing where the challenge is real and the community actually cares about trail access, this is it.",
      "strengths": [
        "Legitimate elevation challenge (8,500 ft over 85 mi) tests climbing endurance",
        "Technical terrain demands strong bike handling and rewards skill development",
        "Benefits Lost River Trails Coalition—racing with purpose beyond personal glory",
        "Grassroots community vibe with genuine local support and WV Gravel Series camaraderie",
        "Excellent value: $65-85 for challenging course and trail advocacy contribution"

      "weaknesses": [
        "August heat + humidity creates serious heat management challenge; not beginner-friendly climate",
        "30-mile aid station gaps require genuine self-sufficiency; no hand-holding",
        "Rural location (2 hrs from Dulles) with limited lodging requires advance planning",
        "Limited national recognition means small field and minimal competitive depth",
        "Spotty cell service and remote sections—if you need constant safety net, skip it"
      ],
      "bottom_line": "The Lost River Classic rewards self-sufficient riders who value authentic challenge over curated experience. If you need perfectly spaced aid, luxury lodging, and Instagram-worthy branding, this isn't your race. If you want to test yourself against honest Appalachian terrain while supporting trail advocacy, and you're willing to manage heat stress and technical descents without constant support, you'll leave satisfied. The suffering is real, but it's the good kind."

      "title": "HEAT STRESS WILL HURT MORE THAN THE CLIMBING",
      "reality": "You can train for 8,500 feet of climbing. You can dial your nutrition and pacing. You can show up with fresh legs and a perfectly tuned bike. But if you don't respect August heat in Appalachian humidity, this race will break you. By Mile 60, you're 5+ hours into constant effort in 80-90% humidity. Sweat stops evaporating. Core temperature climbs. Cognitive function declines. You're staring at 25 more miles with one aid station behind you and limited options for rescue in remote forest sections. The aid stations are 30 miles apart—that's 2-2.5 hours of self-supported grinding. If you miscalculate hydration or fail to manage heat stress early, there's no quick bail-out. And if an afternoon thunderstorm rolls through, those technical rocky descents turn into crash-fests.",

      ],
      "expectation_reset": "This is a heat management race disguised as a climbing race. If you're not heat-adapted, if you don't have a solid hydration strategy for 6-8 hour efforts in humidity, if you expect aid every 15 miles—reconsider. Budget 7-9 hours. Bring 3+ bottles or a hydration pack. Expect to suffer slowly and steadily for the entire day. The course won't give you easy miles. Accept it."

      "character": "The Lost River Classic is Appalachian gravel distilled: constant elevation change through George Washington National Forest roads with no flat recovery sections. You're either grinding uphill on loose gravel or managing rocky descents that punish lapses in attention. The 85-mile course accumulates 8,500 feet via repeated moderate climbs rather than single dramatic ascents. Rocky, rutted descents with embedded rocks demand strong bike handling even when legs are cooked. Remote backcountry sections deliver genuine adventure feel with limited cell service and sparse support. This isn't a race with signature viewpoints or Instagrammable moments. It's 85 miles of honest work where heat management matters more than power output.",
