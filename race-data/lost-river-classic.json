This is grassroots West Virginia gravel at its core: 85 miles of constant climbing through humid forest roads, rocky descents that punish mistakes, and August heat that compounds every effort. You won't find prize purses or Instagram influencers here. You'll find 250 regional riders who showed up to suffer together and support trail advocacy. The course delivers legitimate challenge—8,500 feet of elevation isn't a typo—but the real test is managing heat stress during 6-8 hours of constant work. Aid stations are 30 miles apart. Cell service is spotty. If something goes wrong, you problem-solve or walk out. That's the deal. If you want a well-produced national event with all the amenities, look elsewhere. If you want authentic Appalachian gravel racing where the challenge is real and the community actually cares about trail access, this is it.",

If you need perfectly spaced aid, luxury lodging, and Instagram-worthy branding, this isn't your race. If you want to test yourself against honest Appalachian terrain while supporting trail advocacy, and you're willing to manage heat stress and technical descents without constant support, you'll leave satisfied. The suffering is real, but it's the good kind."

You're either grinding uphill on loose gravel or managing rocky descents that punish lapses in attention.

Rocky, rutted descents with embedded rocks demand strong bike handling even when legs are cooked. Remote backcountry sections deliver genuine adventure feel with limited cell service and sparse support. This isn't a race with signature viewpoints or Instagrammable moments.

      "should_you_race": "You need legitimate climbing fitness and wide-range gearing for the constant Appalachian rollers. August heat plus humidity makes this harder than the elevation suggests, and the rocky technical descents will punish weak bike handling. Show up undertrained and you'll be walking plenty of those punchy climbs in the remote backcountry sections.",
