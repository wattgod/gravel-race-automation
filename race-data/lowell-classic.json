One rider noted this as their \"last gravel race of the year\" suggesting solid season-ending distance choices. Similar distance to Crusher in the Tushar."

Less technical than The Mid South."

Less climbing than The Mid South."

October 26, 2024 delivered \"beautiful sunny skies and 45 degrees at start\" showing late October can provide ideal conditions. However, Michigan fall weather remains unpredictable. The 7 AM start means dealing with whatever conditions arise during the season finale window. More weather exposure than Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

        "explanation": "The course winds through rural Ionia County along the Flat River banks, featuring historic covered bridges.

        "explanation": "Serves as the Michigan Gravel Race Series finale with double points as a \"Premier Race,\" giving it regional significance.

The I Love Gravel Racing series affiliation provides structure, though course details and aid station information remain limited online."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Historic covered bridges and rural Michigan scenery create pleasant race atmosphere. The season finale positioning as \"fall's epic gravel finale\" adds importance for series participants. However, limited course descriptions and rider reports suggest the experience relies heavily on basic gravel road racing fundamentals."

Competitive depth remains regional with Michigan-based teams dominating results. Thinner field than Ouray Gravel Grinder."

        "explanation": "Multiple distance options from 15 to 100 miles serve riders at different levels within one registration. As a series finale with double points, it maximizes value for MGRS participants. Small town Michigan pricing typically stays reasonable compared to destination events."

      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Registration runs $60-90. Lowell's location 15 miles from Grand Rapids provides airport access and lodging options without resort pricing. Small town costs for gas, food, and likely free parking at Fallasburg Park keep expenses manageable. Regional event pricing avoids destination race markups while offering real amenities nearby. Similar expense level to Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

Since I locked up 4th place in the overall Michigan Gravel Race Series (MGRS) and couldn't gain enough points to overtake 3rd, I decided to make this my Iceman MTB race prep. The short course, 39 miles, would be closer to my expected Iceman finish time in 2 weeks, so I raced that distance instead of my typical long course 56 mile. I didn't feel the best on the day but I was able to hold onto the front group into the final 20 person sprint. Legs were cooked by then and I made some poor tactical decisions in the end, which left me way back and out of position for the sprint. I was able to salvage 8th place overall, 2nd in my age group. \n\nHeld on October 25,  2025, this was the last race of the gravel season and the Michigan Gravel Race Series. The Lowell gravel race is a classic style gravel race. You race along the banks of the Flat River and through rural Ionia County, MI on approximately 95% unpaved roads. You can choose from either the 56, 39 or 15 mile routes, all are single loops. The race start sand finishes at Fallasburg County Park, Lowell, MI. \n\n👉 Hey!
