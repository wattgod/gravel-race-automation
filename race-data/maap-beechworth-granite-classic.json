Joshua Tang from Singapore tried \"to keep warm as I waited in anticipation at the start line\" before conditions improved as \"the sun came out.\" April weather in Victoria's High Country means shoulder season gambles where Mount Stanley's red-clay becomes unrideable when wet, adding unpredictability to what could be perfect autumn riding. More weather exposure than Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

Modest altitude compared to Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."
