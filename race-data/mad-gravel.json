Start location at McNeil Scout Ranch dining hall is clear, but packet pickup and parking details remain missing."

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "The 55-mile distance proved deceptive for cdan4th, whose \"hopes for a 3-and-change hours finish\" dissolved into \"maintaining a blistering 11 mph average pace\" by mile 15. His race shortened to 47 miles due to conditions, yet he still found it taxing enough to say \"there were a number of places I kind of wished it were just over already.\" More compact than Grinduro."

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Course features \"alternating loose sand and deadly washboarded sections with short, punchy 12% climbs\" as cdan4th described the county roads. In wet conditions, \"hundreds of skinny tires had turned it into a morass of deep, clinging mud\" on double-track sections. Technical challenge comes from surface conditions rather than bike handling complexity. Less technical than The Mid South."
      },
      "elevation": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "The 3200 feet of climbing delivers \"short, punchy 12% climbs and descents\" across county roads, with cdan4th noting how \"every time I topped out a hill, I was greeted by another hill uphill\" during miles 38-42. The rolling terrain provides steady work without overwhelming single climbs, topping out at 7300 feet from the Scout Ranch start. Less climbing than The Mid South."
      },

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Historical weather data shows average highs of 80°F and lows of 54°F, with a 20% chance of rain on any given day, and gusts reaching 28 mph. Memorial Day 2025 brought \"half an hour of sustained half-inch hail and continuous pink lightning\" the night before, leaving \"completely saturated ground\" for race day. Cdan4th faced \"strong wind and driving rain\" when \"the promised 3pm rain arrived two hours early.\" Colorado weather volatility makes conditions unpredictable and potentially race-altering. More weather exposure than Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

      "altitude": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Starting around 6500 feet at McNeil Scout Ranch and topping at 7300 feet puts riders in Colorado's moderate altitude zone. The elevation adds work without being punishing - high enough that sea level riders notice the thinner air, but not so high that altitude becomes the primary challenge rather than terrain and distance. Similar altitude considerations to Grinduro."
      },
      "adventure": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Cdan4th found \"endless right-angle turns through ranch land mostly by myself under leaden skies weren't really that compelling,\" despite some scenic moments like \"one-lane gravel road winding through the skeet shooting range of camp and it was glorious.\" The Elbert County terrain offers wide open ranch country with Front Range views, but lacks memorable signature features."

      "prestige": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Nathan Trachta's 29th place finish out of 151 riders represents the competitive reality - solid regional turnout but no notable pro presence or national recognition. Bertn05 used Mad Gravel as a tune-up \"test before Unbound,\" indicating its role as a stepping stone rather than destination race in the gravel calendar."
      },
      "race_quality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Course marking was \"exhaustive\" per cdan4th, and Nathan Trachta's lost car keys were found by staff during course sweep, showing operational competence. Two aid stations for 55 miles covers basics adequately. However, cdan4th's anticlimactic finish where \"there wasn't even anyone near the finish line anymore\" suggests timing coordination needs work."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Post-race atmosphere delivers with cdan4th enjoying \"really excellent pulled pork\" and live music in the dining hall, calling the \"post-event vibes\" a gravel racing strength. However, mid-pack finishers may miss the energy - cdan4th noted his finish was \"pretty anticlimactic\" with no one at the line. Family camping and Scout Ranch venue create summer camp atmosphere."
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Denver locals treat this as their backyard gravel fest with family camping at the venue, creating that small-town race atmosphere. But 'family-friendly' often translates to 'not serious enough for dedicated racers,' and the lack of any online chatter or rider reviews suggests the community hasn't built beyond the immediate area."
      },

        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "With a field of 100-200 riders, no field size data, no notable finishers, no pro presence - this screams weekend warrior territory. When a race can't even publish basic participation numbers or attract anyone worth mentioning, you're racing against whoever showed up from the Denver suburbs that morning. Thinner field than Ouray Gravel Grinder."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "At $100 for 55 miles with Scout Ranch venue camping, post-race BBQ, and live music, the pricing reflects honest regional race value. Cdan4th appreciated the \"really excellent pulled pork\" and band, while the family-friendly camping setup adds value for those seeking a gravel festival experience rather than just racing."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Hour drive from Denver International keeps travel reasonable for most participants, with venue camping eliminating hotel costs. Elbert County location avoids tourist pricing pressures found in mountain resort towns. The $100 registration and Scout Ranch setting keep total weekend costs manageable for Colorado Front Range participants. Similar expense level to Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

          "transcript": "3 2 1\n[Music]\ngo I'm born with\nsin and I'm protects\nus from the cold and the\nrain we in no\nh sugar and\nspice y got the goods Goods\nall right we're here at mad gravel um\nwhich is a 160k gravel race with about\n2,000 M of climbing and just near Denver\nin Colorado so we've had a big few days\nof driving to get here cuz we headed to\nUnbound after this but um yeah 3 days of\ndriving to get here got here last night\nhad a quick shake out well a good\nShakeOut ride um and yeah now we're here\nit's a 7:30 start so it was a pretty\nearly wake up it's like 5 o'clock\num got a pretty good dose of the old\npre-race nerves this morning for\nwhatever reason I think that's cuz it's\nearly it feels feels more serious when\nyou get up early but um yeah anyway uh\njust doing a quick warm\nup things I'm worried about for today\nare uh the fact that we're at slight\naltitude I mean it's not it's not crazy\nit's like just under 2,000 M I think but\nit was noticeable last night's ride so\nthat's on my mind uh my toe is still not\nnot 100% so that's pretty achy and sore\nI did a pretty good number on that last\nweek um and I'm probably a bit\nundergeared for this it's not a super\nhilly course I don't think I mean it's\ngoing to be quite fast is what I mean um\nand you have only got a 40 411 is my\nhighest gear so I'm going to be spinning\nout pretty hard I think but that's feel\ngood uh it's a lovely day it's going to\nbe pretty warm later on I think it's I'm\njust in arm warms at the moment so yeah\npretty nice temperature not a cloud in\nthe sky not too windy although if it did\nget windy it would be pretty damn\nnoticeable in this uh in this\nenvironment it's super flat around here\nuh but yeah anyway going to head back\nnow race starts pretty soon so uh yeah\nlet's get into it\nthat's 9\n5 4 3 2 1\ngo\nand I my\nneed this SP do another day\nso the race started and I've never been\nso sure so early that it was not going\nto be my day um my body was not handling\nthe altitude well at all and I couldn't\nput power through the pills to save\nmyself the front group split pretty\nearly and I didn't even consider trying\nto get in it I was already coming to\nterms with the fact that the best chance\nI had at this point was just to Pace\nmyself and hope I'd bounce back\nthen as if my bad legs weren't enough I\nsoon started to have some other problems\nI dropped my chain maybe 10 minutes in\nfrom some corrugations and got it mindly\ntwisted oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] me\nafter sorting that out I got another\nmaybe a minute up the road and then my\nbottle dropped off at the cage\n[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] being so early on in the race it\nreally wasn't an option to leave it\nespecially since I had my CarX in\ngo I'll help you yeah J B\nman\nright what are we doing\nhere so Sheamus why is all your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]\nfalling off your bike are he you saying\nwell it's because this route had some of\nthe worst corrugations I've actually\never ridden on a gravel bike to the\npoint where it would completely sap your\nspeed make the bike drift sideways when\nyou hit them not to mention slamming my\nrecently broken toe into the end of the\nshoe continuously which was just lovely\nthere were also sections where the RO\nwas more sand Than Dirt or gravel and it\nwould just yeah just sa your speed again\nit was pretty soul sucking at times and\nI was definitely muttering a few Choice\nwords so all these factors culminated in\nthe realization that this was just going\nto be one of those days and it brought\nto mind a quote I heard recently from\nJim Warmsley who is my favorite Ultra\nrunner of all\ntime places where you really grow are\nthe ones that keep kicking you in the\nteeth so yeah with that in the back of\nmy mind I gritted my teeth and just\nsettled in for a long\nday so position wise I would imagine I\nwas sitting somewhere around 30th I\npicked my way through a few stragglers\nuntil I caught up to the second group on\nthe road uh but even then I was yo-yoing\noff the bat which was making me pretty\nangry with myself I remember just\nmuttering under my breath just hold the\n[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] wheel man like what are you\ndoing\nyou seen have you the way she plays that\nI know to Des the way there were really\nonly one or two other guys willing to\nwork in this group of about 10 or so and\nas I slowly started to feel better I\nbegan to actually help pull some turns\nand try to get us moving there was a\nfair bit of wind at this point as well\nand it was really noticeable being on\nthe planes like we were so we were\nforming some echelons in the Crosswinds\nwhich I think eventually shed a few\npeople and then I believe a crash made\nit even smaller although I didn't even\nsee this crash so shows where my mind\n[Applause]\nwas now the way this course worked was\nsort of like a figure a so there were\ntwo separate 80 km loops and then you\nwent through a 10 km somewhat techn coal\nsort of CX style double track section at\nthe end of each lap which took you back\nto the start Finish Line by the time we\ngot here I was actually beginning to\nfeel it myself again and gave a little\nbit of jandle through there um and that\ncombined with a few more crashes from\nsome other people meant only three of us\nwere still together when we started on\nour second Loop and then when we went\nunder the start finish I heard the\nannouncer say that we were rounding out\nthe top 10 um and I couldn't believe my\nears the three of us started laughing\nout and uh that was the way it would be\nfor the next\n70k the last third of the race was\npretty tough uh I was feeling pretty\ndamn correct and was really fighting the\nurge to let go of these guys just so I\ncould ride my own pace but I kept\nhanging on cuz I knew if I could just\nget back to that final section with them\nI could probably make a gap in there\nit's an interesting Bond you form\nworking with a small group for so long\nin a race you literally say maybe three\nwords during 3 hours and then it feels\nlike you die for them like you've gone\ninto battle with them or something so\nbefore we got to the final section I\ntold them what an honor it had been\nsuffering with them because we all knew\nthe allegiance was over and we were\nabout to start trying to drop each\nother rep with\nGren\nincinerate incinerate\ninate\ninate so back into the double track we\nwent and I had had an idea of where I\nwanted to push the pace since the first\nlap it was a nasty little 2-minute pinch\nup like a loose four-wheel drivet track\nwhere the group had split last time so I\nwaited patiently until we got there and\nthen just raised the pace and HED they\nwouldn't be able to hold\nit I hear the sirens come for me\nI managed to get a gap and now I just\nhad to hold it for the next 15 minutes\nuntil the end of the race\nhere does my soul with\ngasoline 10 minutes later I was pretty\nconfident there were nowhere to be seen\nbehind me and I was already daydreaming\nabout the free buffet at the end of the\nrace until I looked back and realized\nJoe was only about 40 m behind me so\nwith a big groan I completely emptied\nthe tank and uh thankfully he also\nstarted cramping so yeah my position was\nsafe and I can roll into the\nline so cold as\nice the Flames licking at your feet\nthat's us baby\nwhat\nhappened nice\njob good race good finish buddy thanks\nman that was nice little bur on that\nclimb dude I had nothing that was pretty\nmuch me well then I looked back though\nafter like after that whole headin St\nyou were\nstill I was trying to keep you\nhonest yeah it was\ntough did you see what happened dude\ncrossed up on my wheel and it wiped out\nthe whole pack behind us oh really yeah\nso when did you head tosas right\naway starts on\nWednesday like a local Legion like coach\ncoming you're going to get Ninth Place\nin the T France how does it feel cool as\n[&nbsp;__&nbsp;]\n,000 his race amazing\nthat's me so yeah that was my day at mad\ngravel um in the ninth which I was\npretty happy with but it's interesting\ncuz going into that race if you told me\nI was going to get ninth I would have\nbeen maybe not disappointed but I\nwouldn't have been happy about it really\nbut because of the day I had and how\nhard I had to actually try to get that\nninth um I actually came out of it\nfeeling really proud of it which kind of\njust highlighted for me it's not it's\nnot the result that makes you proud it's\nthe effort that went into it it's if you\ncan do with any race if you can leave it\nknowing that you properly poured all\nyour effort into it and uh you know\ndidn't have anything more then that's\nyou're going to be proud of that race so\nit's something to keep in mind not\neverything's result focused um you can\nstill feel good about a race just\nknowing that you did everything you can\nso just a thought but you know I hope\nyou enjoyed the video um thanks for\nwatching see you",

includes CO2 UT in the desert\nof Western Colorado the Telluride gravel\nrace in the mountainous South Ned gravel\nhigh up in central Colorado just up the\nhill from my home in Boulder and foco\nFondo to the North in Fort Collins\ncombined is quite the varied tour of\nColorado's diverse topography and gravel\nservices for instance I did focofondo\nlast year on my NV road bike with 32s\nand I did Ned gravel last year on a laof\nTrue Grit with that leaf suspension fork\nand honestly I would have been happy on\na mountain bike I have not yet done\nTelluride nor CO2 UT but I intend to\nremedy that soon\nforeign\n[Music]\nthe series concept is relatively new to\ngravel racing and unlike the big dollar\nlifetime Grand Prix and the Belgian\nwaffle ride series Each of which\nfeatures seven events operated by the\nsame owner the Colorado summer of gravel\nis a partnership between four\nindependent events\nWhitney and Zach Allison run focofondo\nand they helped spearhead the Coalition\nwith Telluride and Ned gravel and CO2 UT\nthe scene here for cycling particularly\nbike racing has changed a lot here in\nColorado in the last couple of years a\nlot of the road racing opportunities\nhave really dwindled and one of the\nhopes for Colorado summer of gravel is\nto provide an Avenue and outlet and a\nreally great series that doesn't require\nextensive travel or\ntons of money in order to participate in\nit I really hope it provides an\nopportunity for up-and-coming Racers to\ncontinue to grow in the sport and use\nthis as a way to keep repelling\nthemselves forward\njust like with the Grand Prix and the\nBelgian waffle ride series you don't\nhave to do the whole series of course\nyou can sign up for events individually\nbut by registering for all four you can\nsave a little money and qualify for the\nthree thousand dollars on tap to do the\nfour races it's 500 bucks for the\nColorado series for context Unbound\ngravel one entry is two hundred and\nninety dollars now I'm not trying to\ndissuade you from doing the big ones I\nthink there's certainly something to be\nsaid for doing one of the monuments of\ngravel whether that's Unbound or\nSteamboat or Belgian waffle ride\nCalifornia or the Mid-South but I'm also\na proponent of doing smaller races where\nyou will have a ton of fun and most\nlikely feel a lot less pressure and\nstress about the whole thing\nso let's take a quick look at the main\nevents for each of the four races which\nall offer shorter distances as well\nc-o-t-u-t in Fruita kicks it off May 14.\ndubbed desert gravel this is the\nflattest and sandiest event in the\nseries at 100 miles and 5 000 feet of\nelevation gain this race is 159 if\npurchased separately Telluride is a\nsecond year event last year former U.S\nnational champion Alex house and my\nbuddy Betsy Welch took the wins in the\nmen's and women's races respectively\nBetsy texted me halfway through the race\nhey is it uh okay to keep racing on a\nBroken Spoke\nevidently it was this race is the\nclimbiest of the lot with 85 miles\nbringing in about 10 000 feet of\nelevation gain this race costs 145\ndollars hey this is Scott benge with the\nTelluride growl race going into our\nsecond year we couldn't be more excited\nto be involved in the Colorado summer of\ngravel series what intrigued us the most\nabout the series is the smaller\nindependent races that make it up all\nacross the state not having to make\nmajor travel plans and being able to\nparticipate in a series with a prize\npurse right here in our great state of\nColorado is super special so we can't\nwait to see you all out there Ned gravel\nis only 60 miles but I'm here to tell\nyou it is a brutal 60 miles with 7100\nfeet of climbing it starts over 8 000\nfeet in Netherland and the route tackles\nSwitzerland Trail which is rough\nthis race is 110 dollars if done alone\nhey I'm Gavin Coombs the race director\nfor Ned gravel bike race uh we are so\nexcited to be part of the Colorado\nsummer of gravel\num you're just going to be showcasing\nthe best of Colorado gravel and\neverything that Colorado has to offer an\ninclusive and welcoming way that is just\ngoing to be great for everyone for the\nseries Nate gravel is offering up our\ntungsten course which is new for this\nyear at 70 miles and 8 300 feet of\nclimbing it's a challenging course made\nsome changes over the last couple of\nyears to it it's going to be bigger and\nbetter than ever\nso come on out see what Colorado has to\noffer for gravel and we'll see out there\nand then focal Fondo starts and finishes\nat New Belgium brewery just on the\noutskirts of downtown Fort Collins\nthe 118 mile event is the main one this\nyear last year I got third in the 100\nMiler while Alexi vermeulen won the 140\nmiler I doubt I will be on the podium\nthis year the 118 mile course is new for\n2023 for foco Fondo it kind of rounds\nout a mix of the 100 mile course that\nhas less climbing from the last few\nyears and the 145 that was a little bit\ntoo much to have so much fun on from\n2022 so hopefully the 118 while still\nhaving extra climbs the super fun\nlollipop going into the mountains will\nbe the best of both worlds for this new\nfocofondo course\nfor great gravel races and one nice\nprice if you want to go all in on the\nseries Colorado gravel racing kicks off\nhere in a few weeks with old man winter\nrally February 5th last year Alex and\nanother former U.S national road\nChampion Ruth Winder took the wins we'll\nsee who comes out on top this year and\nthen we've got a full spring summer and\nfall of gravel races with more than a\ndozen good events here in Colorado those\ninclude\nWild Horse Weld County grinder mad\ngravel Pony Express Bighorn gravel\ncrooked gravel Steamboat the gun and\ngrinder slide off 76 High Plains Drifter\ngravo Locos and rad dirt Fest both of\nwhich happen to be on September 30th in\nSouthern Colorado I'll put links to each\nof those races down below which you can\ncheck out after you hit that subscribe\nbutton\nit all adds up to a full four seasons of\ngreat Colorado gravel racing with a\nsummer of gravel now a smack in the\nmiddle of it I hope to see you out there\nat one of these great events\nthank you",

The 55-mile course features fast-rolling gravel with some challenging corrugations that can sap speed and cause bikes to drift sideways. Riders report sections where the surface becomes more sand than gravel, which significantly slows progress. The course includes some single track sections described as loose and spicy. The altitude at just under 2,000 meters is noticeable and affects performance. The event is part of a 3-day Memorial Day weekend festival with camping, food vendors, live music, and family activities. Weather can impact the race, with heavy rain sometimes forcing course modifications. The venue offers spectacular views of the Colorado Front Range and high peaks."
