Start location at McNeil Scout Ranch dining hall is clear, but packet pickup and parking details remain missing."

        "explanation": "The 55-mile distance proved deceptive for cdan4th, whose \"hopes for a 3-and-change hours finish\" dissolved into \"maintaining a blistering 11 mph average pace\" by mile 15. His race shortened to 47 miles due to conditions, yet he still found it taxing enough to say \"there were a number of places I kind of wished it were just over already.\""

        "explanation": "Course features \"alternating loose sand and deadly washboarded sections with short, punchy 12% climbs\" as cdan4th described the county roads. In wet conditions, \"hundreds of skinny tires had turned it into a morass of deep, clinging mud\" on double-track sections. Technical challenge comes from surface conditions rather than bike handling complexity."
      },
      "elevation": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "The 3200 feet of climbing delivers \"short, punchy 12% climbs and descents\" across county roads, with cdan4th noting how \"every time I topped out a hill, I was greeted by another hill uphill\" during miles 38-42. The rolling terrain provides steady work without overwhelming single climbs, topping out at 7300 feet from the Scout Ranch start."
      },
      "climate": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Memorial Day 2025 brought \"half an hour of sustained half-inch hail and continuous pink lightning\" the night before, leaving \"completely saturated ground\" for race day. Cdan4th faced \"strong wind and driving rain\" when \"the promised 3pm rain arrived two hours early.\" Colorado weather volatility makes conditions unpredictable and potentially race-altering."
      },
      "altitude": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Starting around 6500 feet at McNeil Scout Ranch and topping at 7300 feet puts riders in Colorado's moderate altitude zone. The elevation adds work without being punishing - high enough that sea level riders notice the thinner air, but not so high that altitude becomes the primary challenge rather than terrain and distance."
      },
      "adventure": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Cdan4th found \"endless right-angle turns through ranch land mostly by myself under leaden skies weren't really that compelling,\" despite some scenic moments like \"one-lane gravel road winding through the skeet shooting range of camp and it was glorious.\" The Elbert County terrain offers wide open ranch country with Front Range views, but lacks memorable signature features."
      },
      "prestige": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Nathan Trachta's 29th place finish out of 151 riders represents the competitive reality - solid regional turnout but no notable pro presence or national recognition. Bertn05 used Mad Gravel as a tune-up \"test before Unbound,\" indicating its role as a stepping stone rather than destination race in the gravel calendar."
      },
      "race_quality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Course marking was \"exhaustive\" per cdan4th, and Nathan Trachta's lost car keys were found by staff during course sweep, showing operational competence. Two aid stations for 55 miles covers basics adequately. However, cdan4th's anticlimactic finish where \"there wasn't even anyone near the finish line anymore\" suggests timing coordination needs work."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Post-race atmosphere delivers with cdan4th enjoying \"really excellent pulled pork\" and live music in the dining hall, calling the \"post-event vibes\" a gravel racing strength. However, mid-pack finishers may miss the energy - cdan4th noted his finish was \"pretty anticlimactic\" with no one at the line. Family camping and Scout Ranch venue create summer camp atmosphere."
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Denver locals treat this as their backyard gravel fest with family camping at the venue, creating that small-town race atmosphere. But 'family-friendly' often translates to 'not serious enough for dedicated racers,' and the lack of any online chatter or rider reviews suggests the community hasn't built beyond the immediate area."
      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "No field size data, no notable finishers, no pro presence - this screams weekend warrior territory. When a race can't even publish basic participation numbers or attract anyone worth mentioning, you're racing against whoever showed up from the Denver suburbs that morning."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "At $100 for 55 miles with Scout Ranch venue camping, post-race BBQ, and live music, the pricing reflects honest regional race value. Cdan4th appreciated the \"really excellent pulled pork\" and band, while the family-friendly camping setup adds value for those seeking a gravel festival experience rather than just racing."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Hour drive from Denver International keeps travel reasonable for most participants, with venue camping eliminating hotel costs. Elbert County location avoids tourist pricing pressures found in mountain resort towns. The $100 registration and Scout Ranch setting keep total weekend costs manageable for Colorado Front Range participants."
