Michigan's rolling hills don't offer the big mountain drama of Colorado, but they grind you down through cumulative punishment. The elevation profile stays mysterious, which probably means it's a series of soul-crushing rollers."

        "explanation": "September in Michigan's Upper Peninsula is a weather gamble where you might get perfect fall conditions or early winter misery.

Bears are apparently common enough to knock down course signs, adding wildlife management to your weather concerns."

The organization embraces controlled chaos over polished professionalism."

Starting in Ishpeming and grinding through whatever the Upper Peninsula throws at you creates the kind of war stories people tell for decades."

        "explanation": "Only 70 spots for the 100-mile bike race means you're racing against whoever got lucky with the under-a-minute registration window.

The password-protected early registration for sponsors and trail crew doesn't exactly scream competitive depth."

        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "You get what you pay for: a brutal challenge with minimal hand-holding in beautiful Michigan wilderness.

No prize purse or fancy amenities - just you versus the course and whatever the bears leave standing."

      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "The real cost lies in reaching Ishpeming and dealing with Marji Camp logistics. Andrea Larson invested in a dropper post specifically for the race, while Jill Martindale used targeted races like \"Arrowhead 135, Polar Roll Ultra, Midsouth, Barry Roubaix Psycho Killer\" as expensive training for this event. Equipment needs extend beyond typical gravel racing."
