September in Michigan's Upper Peninsula is a weather gamble where you might get perfect fall conditions or early winter misery. The race philosophy of 'you're on your own' extends to weather preparedness - no bail-out options when conditions turn ugly. Bears are apparently common enough to knock down course signs, adding wildlife management to your weather concerns. More weather exposure than Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."
