It's gravel terrain in a place that actually understands bike racing, not some weekend warrior fever dream."

Valkenburg is a cycling tourism hotspot which inflates prices during race season, though the infrastructure exists to support visitors. The race provides accommodation resources and camping options at Wildbach Camping in nearby Hellenthal, but you're still paying Western European rates for basics."
