The basics are covered but communication clarity needs work."

        "explanation": "Nicole Oh's elite group finished the 97km Day 1 course by 12:30pm despite a 10-minute tea stop at Gulgong, completing the first 60km in under 2 hours on champagne gravel. The Saturday Long Course qualifies for Bushranger Gravel Series, giving it competitive legitimacy beyond just weekend riding."

      "technicality": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Multiple rider reports describe \"champagne gravel\" throughout with \"just a few corrugations\" encountered. Day 2 started and ended on tarmac with gravel in between. The region is \"relatively flat\" over the Great Dividing Range, making this rhythm riding rather than technical challenge—perfect for riders who want to maintain pace."

      "elevation": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Day 1 covers 1000m climbing over 97km with the first section net downhill, concentrating climbs after the Gulgong feed stop. Day 2 adds slightly more at 1200m but finishes with \"a nice gentle downhill roll home on tarmac with a tailwind.\" Rolling terrain that rewards endurance over climbing power."
      },
      "climate": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Nicole Oh reported both days \"started a little on the chilly side\" with morning fog, then \"glorious sunshine for the rest of the day\" once the sun burned through. The 2026 event moved from August to October, suggesting organizers learned something about winter timing reliability in central NSW."
      },
      "altitude": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Located in Mudgee region of central NSW, approximately 240km northwest of Sydney. No specific altitude data provided in rider reports, but the inland location keeps it at manageable elevation without sea-level advantage or high-altitude concerns affecting performance."
      },
      "adventure": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Riders cruise through \"ancient rock formations\" and \"backroads winding through gum trees and gold-tinged paddocks.\" Nicole Oh noted Day 2 was \"a lot more scenic\" with 45 minutes spent stopping for photos and \"just sitting in the sun.\" The weekend structure encourages exploration of wine country beyond just racing."

        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Mary's Mayhem launched in 2024, making it barely a toddler in gravel race years. Sure, it made the AusCycling Gravel National Calendar and feeds into the Bushranger Gravel Series, but that's participation trophy stuff. No big names, no race reports worth reading, no YouTube coverage—it's still building its reputation one rider at a time."
      },
      "race_quality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "The race hits basic checkmarks with on-course feed zones, mechanical support, and Trek UCI Gravel World Series partnerships. But the research shows zero details about course marking, timing systems, or operational execution. For a two-year-old event, they're still figuring out the fundamentals while promising 'champagne gravel' experiences."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Small Batch Brewery hosts finish with \"fresh food, Live DJ, Games\" from 2-5pm, followed by Kelly's Irish Pub after-party. Sunday concludes at Rylstone markets where founder Mike Israel said \"practically every resident came out. We felt so welcomed. It was magic.\" The framework delivers but execution is still maturing."
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Local Rotary Clubs and CWA branches staff checkpoints and bake homemade cakes for feed zones. At Gulgong, riders were \"greeted by a lovely spread of homemade cakes and slices, courtesy of the local Rotary club.\" Strong regional support creates festival atmosphere, though the broader gravel community is still discovering the event."
      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "No field size data, no notable finishers, no pro participation mentioned anywhere. For a race that's been around two years and can't generate rider reviews or race reports, the competitive depth is clearly thin. This is participation-level racing, not where you go to test yourself against serious competition."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Entry fees are \"well below industry average\" as organizers aim to \"recover costs\" rather than profit. Risk-free refunds until midday Friday, multiple course options, brewery parties, and Sunday market rolls create solid weekend package. Family and group discounts extend the accessibility."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Mudgee sits 240km northwest of Sydney, so you're looking at significant travel costs to reach this regional NSW town. No accommodation details provided, and being a 'weekend getaway' destination suggests you'll need lodging. The brewery partnerships might keep food/drink costs reasonable, but getting there will cost you."
