        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Three distances at 24, 38, and 58 miles with staggered starts from 9am to 10:45am manage traffic flow effectively. Race director Mark Wright warns \"The race could be lost near the beginning but not won\" about Mann Road's early technical challenge that can derail longer distance attempts. Similar distance to Crusher in the Tushar."
      },
      "technicality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Mann Road's \"sandy dirt uphill\" claims riders \"whose wheels get stuck, lose traction or topple\" right after the ski area descent. The soft soil and wetland mud puddles require line choice skills, but it's more about traction management than technical bike handling through southwest Michigan's rolling terrain. Less technical than The Mid South."

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Called a 'roller coaster' course with 2500 feet of gain over 62 miles, which works out to manageable rollers rather than sustained climbs. No named climbs or elevation profile details provided, suggesting the hills are there but nothing worth bragging about. Southwest Michigan isn't known for mountains, and this course apparently doesn't change that reputation. Less climbing than The Mid South."
      },
      "climate": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "March weather swings wildly—Pete Post raced through 3 inches of fresh snow in 2014 while 2025 saw 35°F temps. \"Some years are chilly and icy, while others are sunny and warm,\" making studded tires a gamble that paid off for prepared riders during the snowy edition. More weather exposure than Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."
      },
      "altitude": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "This is southwest Michigan, not Colorado. Starting elevation isn't mentioned because it's essentially at sea level, and the 2500 feet of climbing doesn't take you anywhere meaningful altitude-wise. If you need altitude training, you're in the wrong state entirely. Lower altitude than Gravel Worlds — no thin-air concerns."
      },
      "adventure": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "The course winds \"through forests, around lakes, past farms, and across open fields\" on gravel roads \"often overlooked by cars and tourists.\" Conditions can include \"mud, water crossings, or patches of snow and ice,\" but it's countryside exploration rather than wilderness adventure."
      },
      "prestige": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Multiple March Fly and June Fly awards recognize race director excellence and tough conditions, but winning speeds show regional competition levels. Robert Oehler's 22.1 mph average for 58 miles in 2025 reflects solid midwest gravel racing without national-level field depth."
      },
      "race_quality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Wave management prevents crashes at Mann Road, chip timing posts live results, and awards ceremonies run promptly at 1:15pm. Pete Post noted seamless first-year execution, though the challenging start can determine outcomes early rather than building drama throughout the course."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Post-race BBQ from Q-It Up, Goshen Brewing beverages, warming fires, and Trek bike raffles create a \"full-blown experience\" atmosphere. Pete Post appreciated how \"post race brews and lunch totally hit the spot,\" though the community center venue limits destination appeal."
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "\"People come back year after year because they fall in love with the vibe, the people, and the challenge.\" Riders \"stop to help with mechanical issues, and share snacks and stories,\" creating what participants describe as \"a reunion of outdoor lovers and biking enthusiasts.\""
      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Wave starts accommodate 0-12mph beginners alongside 22+mph racers, showing the broad recreational range. While 80-rider waves and 700+ total participants create good field size, the lack of mentioned pro riders or notable past champions indicates weekend warrior competition levels. Thinner field than Ouray Gravel Grinder."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Starting at $75 individual entry with tiered pricing that maxes at $90 for 750+ registrants is reasonable for a full day experience. You get the race, post-race BBQ, beer, medals for age divisions, and a shot at winning a Trek in the raffle. First 500 get a t-shirt, and winners get free entry next year—they're actually trying to give you something for your money."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Vandalia Community Center staging keeps venue costs low, with packet pickup Friday evening or Saturday morning for convenience. Small-town Michigan lodging and dining won't strain budgets, while the $90 entry cap even for maximum field size maintains affordability for Midwest families and recreational racers. More affordable than Crusher in the Tushar."

          "description": "Here are some super-slow motion video clips from the March 19th, 2022 Melting Mann gravel bike race in Vandalia Michigan.  I was just a spectator not an official photographer.  I was having fun and they were working hard.  I don’t like work!  I did not cover the event but went to sections that the 24 mile was on so there is a lot missing, I think I got some faster 34 and 60 mi riders also.   For my photographer friends: Video was shot with a Sony A7SIII camera at ISO 12,800 (not a typo)  1/500  sec, f-9.0 in HD, S-Log3 10 bit 4:2:2, 240 fps",
