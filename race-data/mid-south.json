        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "When dry, the red dirt roads are relatively smooth and fast. When wet, they become a technical nightmare—not because of rocks or drops, but because the mud makes forward progress nearly impossible. 'The mud is so thick I couldn't pedal' is a common race report theme."
