          "transcript": "[Music]\nMega Mids South was extremely\nchallenging. I think it was one of the\nmost challenging rides that I've done in\nthe past several years.\nThe Mega Mids South is 300.9 mi that\nstarts and ends at District Bicycles.\nThe route at mile 100 is Guthrie,\nOklahoma. From Guthri, Oklahoma, we go\nnorth to Perry. Perry to Pawne,\nOklahoma. And from Pony, Oklahoma\nthrough Glenco and back to Stillwater,\nOklahoma.\nYou're never more than 50 miles from\nStill Water, but it doesn't feel like\nthat. It feels like a genuine adventure.\nAnd at any given point on the route,\nit's what's really cool about it is that\nthe route could be either it could be a\nreally really challenging individual\ncontinuous effort with maybe a nap or\ntwo\nor you could make it a 5 to 7 day\njourney. And I think that's the mark of\na good bike packing route is that it\ncould be both at the same time.\nSo, we have this 300-mile loop around\ncentral Oklahoma, and we put out an\ninvitation for anyone to come and ride\nit or race it.\nAnd on a Wednesday morning in September,\nabout 150 people lined up in Still Water\nto test themselves against 300 m of\nOklahoma dirt roads.\nThis is the story of that ride.\n[Laughter]\nI'm really hoping nothing's wrong with\nmy bike.\n&gt;&gt; Thank you. And sorry about the extra 50\nmiles, but uh that does make it an\nultra. And there's a lot of people out\nhere riding their first ultra. Can we\njust see the hands of the people doing\nthat for the first time? That's like\nmost of the people.\n&gt;&gt; So, as milder,\nuh, doesn't\n&gt;&gt; I'm so stoked for you all to see this\nroute. It's going to be a little hot,\nbut you know, you can deal. Just drink a\nlot of water the whole day, especially.\nYeah, that's all I got. Let's go ride\nbikes.\n&gt;&gt; My name is Josh. I'm a producer with the\nMidsouth and I'm covering this event\nwith my brother Caleb, who's my moto\npilot, and my friends Brian and Nathan\nin the support van with cameras.\nThere it is. Thank you.\nYeah.\nAll right.\npeople seem to be having a great time on\nthese first few miles. We're seeing lots\nof different setups for the ride. Some\nare going with ultra minimal kit and\nsome are packing it all. At this point\nin the ride, I'm excited to see how this\ngoes for everyone.\n[Applause]\nSo, after about the first 20 m of\ncruising along with riders, we thought\nwe'd boost up to the front of the group\nto see what was shaken. We started\nmaking our way up the group, and folks\nseem to be going a lot quicker than I\nexpected. Taking a look at the track\nleaders tracking site, we see that our\nleaders are almost to the Simmeron\nRiver.\nWhat's up, Henry?\n&gt;&gt; Hey, Michael. How's it going,\nman? This is a blast out here. Having a\ngood time.\n&gt;&gt; It's beautiful.\n&gt;&gt; Things were pretty lively at the front\nof the group for the first 50 miles or\nso as we ride along with these two local\nOklahoma racers.\nWe see Justin Carrey in the back making\na hard push to catch.\nThese guys are just jamming. And\nJustin's right there the whole time.\nAnd here we see Malachi Caldwell, a\nyoung quick rider making an early push\ntowards the front.\n&gt;&gt; Just a few miles up the road, we see our\nlead rider, Dennis, already near the\nSimon River. smiding and you know\nenjoying the view. It's supposed to be\nreally hot.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but I think it's coming.\nI mean,\nDennis does have a win at the 400mile\nEast Texas Showdown race. He has a plan\nand it looks like he's sticking to it.\nAll right, so we're back earlier on\ncourse down on River Road.\nAnd here we pass Bobby Snder on the flat\nbar mountain bike with arrow bars.\n&gt;&gt; A popular setup for this kind of riding\nas he enjoys the shady canopy.\nThere's a nice vintage mountain bike\nbasket packing rig.\n&gt;&gt; The tarp's off, man.\n&gt;&gt; You guys are so rude.\n&gt;&gt; Here's a group of locals\n&gt;&gt; all the time.\n&gt;&gt; Keeping that pace pretty high.\nGreat.\n&gt;&gt; Arkansas High Country Race, Doom, East\nTexas Showdown, The Tour Divide, you\nname it. Most of these guys have\nprobably ridden it and they probably did\nit on a single speed.\nThis is a great shady section of River\nRoad as you go parallel to the Simmeron\nRiver for a couple of miles.\n&gt;&gt; Plus, you got to appreciate the local\nart.\nWelcome to Ripley. Like most small\ncommunities here, they have a well\nstocked sea store.\n&gt;&gt; This building was made for bikes to lean\nagainst.\n&gt;&gt; It's a beautiful day.\n&gt;&gt; It's dusty\n&gt;&gt; and crusty.\n&gt;&gt; And\nhow are you?\n&gt;&gt; Lots of new friends out, which is fun.\n&gt;&gt; One fun thing about this sport is that\nyou're testing your athletic limits\nwhile fueling your body on highly\nprocessed foods.\n&gt;&gt; It's great.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Oh, yes. This is where it's at. right\nhere.\n&gt;&gt; Free of\n&gt;&gt; I'm eating potato wedges at 10:00 a.m.\nMy life's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] awesome.\n&gt;&gt; Pan fried spam, a little bit of soy\nsauce. There's like a little green thing\nsauce in here, and then rice and wrap it\nin seaweed. It is a delight. I brought\nsix of them.\nGreat so far. Right.\n&gt;&gt; What's up with the sarcas?\n&gt;&gt; We're like 30 miles in. So grace.\n&gt;&gt; So the stretch from Ripley to the next\nresupply is about 37 mi. But the\nheadwinds kicked in and the heat's\nstarting to build.\nI hear there's a party at Guthrie. Love\nit.\n&gt;&gt; This is a tough stretch and some riders\nsay it's even the hardest, but there's\nalso something you wouldn't expect in\nOklahoma. A climb with a 12% grade.\nBrethren Hill.\nLuckily, our friend Susan from Grounded\nNebraska was there to lift the vibes.\nWho's there?\nIt's all downhill, right?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Walking is riding.\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to bike packing.\n&gt;&gt; Just taking it.\n&gt;&gt; Can't teach that.\n&gt;&gt; Hello again.\nIt was about this time in the route when\nI remembered something Dr. Seth Wood had\nsaid after his first recon ride on this\nroute.\n&gt;&gt; First off, I think that first leg is u\nthe hardest leg of the whole route. It's\nIt's kind of interesting to have the\nfirst 100 miles be\nat least from my perspective among the\nhardest.\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\nI think so.\n&gt;&gt; We just got to do that 10 more times or\nnine more times.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; First time we never fully got across the\nhighway from Guthrie. Um and even the\nsecond time when we had less mud. Um\neven once we got across the highway, it\nstill felt like we had ages to go.\nSo by late morning, the temperatures\nwere already reaching close to 90°.\nWe were feeling the heat on the moto and\nwe definitely expected some of the\nriders to have effects from the heat.\n&gt;&gt; I'm sure there's going to be quite a\nfew.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Still having fun. That's all that\nmatters.\nOkay, we're at Carney. Mile 65.\nIt's starting to get really hot and it's\nstarting to show on some of the rider\nfaces. This point in the day, the heat\nis becoming a big factor. And this\nsection of the courses,\nuh, limestone, gravel, the headwind, and\nit's getting hot, so it's just heat's\nreflecting up in your face.\nOur lead rider, Dennis, rolled through\ncarne, no stops. We just saw\nMichael Ray and Henry Rolfing here.\nUh they are doing their gas station\nritual and heading on out.\n&gt;&gt; Um we'll see what happens this afternoon\nas the heat continues to crank up.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's got hot.\n&gt;&gt; I was making pretty good time through\nthe first 40 or so miles and\n&gt;&gt; it's been pretty rough.\ngets this hot, it's hard to get any food\ndown for me. So,\ngo slow now and ride harder overnight\njust to beat some of the heat, right?\n&gt;&gt; It feels like like 5,000°.\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; You're young. You can do it.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. I'll die young, too.\n&gt;&gt; How you doing?\n&gt;&gt; A lot of climbing.\n&gt;&gt; A lot more climbing than I was\nexpecting.\n&gt;&gt; Good.\n&gt;&gt; I just like did decided to be really\nslow going on the gate and they're\ndropping like flies coming into here.\n&gt;&gt; Just Yeah, I feel bad. But I feel good.\nI feel I feel bad about them. Good about\nme.\n&gt;&gt; It's their problem.\n&gt;&gt; I have learned\nIf I finish by like 2:00 tomorrow, I\nshould be good. So, whatever that takes,\nlike 10 mph overall average.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, I think trying to ride at\nnight is going to be nice.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's going to be way cooler. Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I think the crux is going to be this\nafternoon when it gets really hot and\nhilly on the next section. Um, so yeah,\nI just kind of like try to stay within\nmyself and not blow up.\nSnow plan.\nHeat.\nBy early afternoon, the heat had reached\nup over 100° with a steady headwind, and\nthe riding is just become a brutal\ngrind. As our crew heads back to refuel,\nthe riders push into the heat. We heard\nreports of riders flocking to the shade,\nvomiting, and getting dizzy.\nWe took a short break to check on some\nof those riders who had dropped. And by\nthis point, we estimate there only about\nhalf of the riders left on course.\nAll right, we are 10 hours into this\nrace. We're at mile 155 and the sun is\nfinally starting to get closer to the\nhorizon. There's the breeze is cooling\noff. Feels pretty good out here. But\nthis afternoon has been absolutely\nbrutal. We just caught up with the\nleader, Dennis, uh, at mile 155. He's\ncovered in salt.\n&gt;&gt; Brutal.\n&gt;&gt; 300 miles on this heat is\n&gt;&gt; Oh, it's I don't know. There's no words.\nIt's just so hard. Yeah, I'm okay. I'm\nuh I have another uh\nI think uh\n13 13 miles maybe.\n&gt;&gt; To a stop.\nGoing to get some uh some more salt.\nLook at this.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. So all your salt is on your\nclothes.\n&gt;&gt; I need more salt. So this afternoon we\nsaw Malachi Caldwell put in some amazing\nriding through that heat. He actually\ngot up within 5 miles uh of Dennis in\nsecond place. But as the afternoon has\nkind of uh continued to be brutally hot,\num the top five has shifted around a\nbit.\nAnd right now Justin Kerry and Bart\nHobbs are the top three men.\n&gt;&gt; We're going to press see what happens.\n&gt;&gt; Uh but since this afternoon heat has\nhit, Malachi has slipped back a little\nbit. still making good time, but Bart\nHobbs and a couple of other folks,\nincluding our first place female,\nEleanor, um, have moved up into the top\nthree.\nAnd Teresa and Eleanor, our first place\nand second place women are also putting\nin some incredible riding. Just so much\nwork in this heat.\nThat's the plan, guys. I'm going to beat\nhim.\n&gt;&gt; I'm just giving him a little head start.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. You ready to push through\nthe night?\n&gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.\nWe're like yo-yoing.\nI mean, maybe he\nIf the sun went down and it's hard down\nhere\nand the moon's going to come out\nthe Heat. Heat.\nThat looks like the sun.\nYeah, I had the\nI mean I was probably leading by uh\nabout 40 minutes and then um\nI just\nI had five flats and then the last flat\nI was climbing over a barrier um and I\nuh I put a clear tire in a torn or\nsomething and it deflated immediately\nand I couldn't find uh the hole.\nAnd I was out of CO2, so I couldn't put\na CO2 in to put a bacon in. And they\njust sat there by the side of the road.\nWaited for the second place to come by.\nHe passed me, gave me a tube. I was\nlike, \"Oh, great. I'll I'll put a tube.\nMaybe I'll maybe I'll catch him.\" I put\na tube in. I rode on it for one mile. It\ndeflated. And I was like, \"Ah.\"\nClose by to this town over here where it\ndeflated. So, I just walked to the hotel\nover here and just like, well, next\ntime.\n&gt;&gt; You're cruising non-stop. Yeah. Did you\nrest at all?\n&gt;&gt; That's it.\n&gt;&gt; No stopping, right? No rest.\n&gt;&gt; No stopping.\n&gt;&gt; Oh, so impressive, man. Did it even stop\nfor water?\n&gt;&gt; Are you kidding me?\n&gt;&gt; Not for like 100 miles.\n&gt;&gt; You're almost sub 24.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I can go a little faster. Let's\ngo.\n&gt;&gt; Let's go, dude.\n&gt;&gt; Come on.\n&gt;&gt; All right, here's Justin coming through\ncampus on the final miles of the course.\nPerfect.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. And I don't know what time we\nactually left, but you arrived at 8:01.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. No, we I'm\n&gt;&gt; We left after 8.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think we left at\n&gt;&gt; It was fun.\n&gt;&gt; Incredible push through the night.\n&gt;&gt; I don't know. I I got like a second\nwave.\n&gt;&gt; Incredible ride. This is really fun to\nwatch. Great job.\n&gt;&gt; Thank you guys.\n&gt;&gt; Cheers.\n&gt;&gt; So, with our first finisher back and the\ncourse FKT established, we head back out\non course. But as soon as we get out, we\nrealize Rob Finnegan has made his\nfinish.\n&gt;&gt; So, you're not on track leader.\n&gt;&gt; I know. I\n&gt;&gt; did.\n&gt;&gt; Did you do the whole thing?\n&gt;&gt; Hell yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Well, I believe that you're officially\nsecond place.\n&gt;&gt; Oh, really?\nWe just didn't know you were coming in.\n&gt;&gt; Shortly after, we see Bart Hobbs get it\ndone.\n&gt;&gt; This the last section coming in is just\nstraight into a win.\nWe did it. We did it.\n&gt;&gt; That was a big whooping.\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; Not long after that, we see Teresa\nBender, our first female, finish the\nSo, we're at mile 241, about 30 hours\ninto the race. We see a lot of riders\nhave ridden overnight and skipped sleep\nto take advantage of the break in the\nheat. Now, it's midday and the heat is\nback.\n&gt;&gt; I haven't seen anybody in like 8 or 9\nhours. Mentally, I think I'm fine. I'm\ntired.\n&gt;&gt; Everything hurts. Like, literally,\neverything hurts.\n&gt;&gt; That wind is kind of ferocious today. I\ndidn't hallucinate, but usually that's\nlike night two.\n&gt;&gt; Cooler than yesterday.\n&gt;&gt; But not cold. Slept about a hour, hour\nand a half in Morrison.\n&gt;&gt; Time for cold drinks.\n&gt;&gt; All the drinks.\nI like the sitting next to the ice\ncream.\n&gt;&gt; I'm tempted. I'm t I'm tempted, dude.\n&gt;&gt; Uh I sat down a couple times and slept\nand I uh I just sat against the wall at\nLo's.\n&gt;&gt; That's all I need.\n&gt;&gt; So\n&gt;&gt; and the headwind.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. The combination of the two. It's\nlike a blow dryer to the face for\n80 miles.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean, there wasn't much shade\nfor a while there and uh as soon as I\nfound some, I was like, I'm going to\ntake a nap.\nLet's go sit in the heat. I mean,\n&gt;&gt; yeah, you guys\n&gt;&gt; anyone\nsince\nI don't know, 3:00 in the morning.\n&gt;&gt; So, yeah, it's good to see there's still\nother people out here.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n&gt;&gt; I'm not the only one struggling.\n&gt;&gt; As the heat cranks up on this second\nday, we see riders taking advantage of\nshade wherever they can find it,\nincluding behind the liquor store in\nMorrison.\nFrom Morrison, we jumped back on course\nto Perry Lake about mile 164.\nIt's about 300 p.m. and we found this\ngroup getting a break in the shade. They\nseem to be in much better spirits than\nthe sleepless riders we saw in Panee.\nAnd I think just generally glad they\ndecided to try for good sleep.\n&gt;&gt; It was so bright. It was so\n&gt;&gt; I thought they were headlights.\n&gt;&gt; I was actually surprised like how much\nlike the I don't know them.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. So yeah, she did the whole\nthing.\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\n&gt;&gt; See you all here. Thank you.\n&gt;&gt; It wasn't long after this that we heard\nour first place single speed finisher\nhad come in.\n&gt;&gt; Welcome back.\nFirst place single speed right here.\n&gt;&gt; You have any words for the people?\n&gt;&gt; Uh, that was something.\n&gt;&gt; We've been on the lookout for riders\ncoming out of Narnia, the single track\nsection of the course. But we weren't\nseeing anyone come through this section\nand started to get concerned.\n&gt;&gt; What in the heck did you do that for? Is\nthat Narnia?\n&gt;&gt; That was interesting.\n&gt;&gt; It turns out about a dozen riders had\ntaken refuge in the air conditioning.\n&gt;&gt; Looking good, man. Thank you.\n&gt;&gt; Cowboy Travel Plaza is a\nis a zombie apocalypse right now, myself\nincluded. But\n&gt;&gt; yeah, is that recording?\n&gt;&gt; But we were sitting there was like go\nride and just get really hot or like\nwait it out and try to go for longer.\n&gt;&gt; With riders spread out on course from\nGuthrie all the way through Panee, we\nstart to see some dark clouds developing\nin the north. Over the course of the\nnext hour, the wind dramatically picks\nup and the clouds get darker and darker.\nSo, we decide to check it out.\n&gt;&gt; The National Weather Service in Tulsa\nput out a severe thunderstorm warning.\nThe storm was warned for golf ball hail,\n70 mph winds.\nLook what happens right as this storm\nwent right over Pawne. You see it flare\nup all of a sudden. bit of an inflow\nnotch in that as well.\n&gt;&gt; We know there are a lot of riders on\ncourse in this area, so we follow the\nstorm cell getting as close as we can to\ntheir location.\n&gt;&gt; Another batch of storms came in right\nbehind it.\n&gt;&gt; And things start to get serious. Yeah,\n&gt;&gt; our Oklahoma Mezonet station did record\na 72 mph wind gust\n&gt;&gt; and there's a large group of riders\nright under the eye of the storm.\nAnd you got that.\n&gt;&gt; What we didn't know at the time was that\nthese storms hit the hardest in town\nnear Ponyie Lake.\n&gt;&gt; This time of the year when we have this\ntype of heat, tornado, micro burst, we\ncan get a lot of instability. And we\ncertainly had that. There is a\nsignificant amount of damage, several\nroad closures, and emergency crews\nthroughout town.\nOh, [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Keep going.\n&gt;&gt; It kind of flew up.\n&gt;&gt; Went from right on top of us. talking.\n&gt;&gt; We couldn't see that was like 100 ft.\n&gt;&gt; Oh yeah, we got hit in a downpour. Had\nto take shelter under some barn\n&gt;&gt; and then uh just waited out. There were\ntrees snapped over. All kinds of crazy\nstuff happening.\n&gt;&gt; Oh my gosh.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it was nuts. Snap\n&gt;&gt; and only slept an hour this whole time.\n&gt;&gt; Are you kidding?\n&gt;&gt; No, I didn't even want to sleep the\nhour, but it was so hot. There was no\nother option this afternoon. So, we all\nFrank tried to sleep for an hour. He\ndidn't even sleep at all, I don't think.\n&gt;&gt; But yeah, we hadn't slept until this\nafternoon.\n&gt;&gt; for an hour. So, yeah, no Sonic for us\ntonight. We're going to share a Cliff\nBar and figure it out in the morning\ncuz that's all I have, I think, is a\nCliff Bar and instant coffee.\n&gt;&gt; Son of\n&gt;&gt; I threw my extra one away. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. I think what we're going to do\nis set up camp right now.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a great\n&gt;&gt; and then get up in the morning and\nfinish it out.\n&gt;&gt; Purple.\n&gt;&gt; I mean,\n&gt;&gt; I guess like right on top of it.\n&gt;&gt; I think so.\n&gt;&gt; What is it?\n&gt;&gt; Just I think I was about to get in my\ntent and then got my feet lit up.\nI hate that happened, but\n&gt;&gt; I'm kind of glad cuz let's we're going\nto get up here and it's going to be\ngreat.\n&gt;&gt; You know what I hope happens.\n&gt;&gt; I hope you're right.\n&gt;&gt; I hope I'm right, Sue. Probably not, but\nwe can always set up camp another mile\ndown the road in the mud.\n&gt;&gt; We have to. It's no different than right\nhere. Just hopefully no [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] bees.\n&gt;&gt; I wish it was bees.\n&gt;&gt; What was it?\n&gt;&gt; Like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] yellow jackets or hornets\nor something.\n&gt;&gt; Stuck into them,\n&gt;&gt; Mark. Yeah, your brakes aren't working.\nIs that right?\n&gt;&gt; Well, I don't know. They're all Yeah. I\nmean, that is what I said.\n&gt;&gt; Look, I haven't had in like 4 hours.\nEven a drink of water.\nSounds kind of tight.\n&gt;&gt; Um, how much water do you have?\n&gt;&gt; Quite a bit.\n&gt;&gt; Can I use some to clean off your brake?\n&gt;&gt; Uh, yeah.\nI'm pulling too.\nNot really.\nI wish I was in my tent right now with\nmy horn.\n&gt;&gt; Dude, you don't seem to realize\n&gt;&gt; I was. Dude, you don't know how happy I\nwas to be set in my team.\n&gt;&gt; My [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]\n&gt;&gt; Who's that?\n&gt;&gt; I just came out for a little training\nride to see the boys. I didn't know I'd\nget totally roped into a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] redneck\n[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] show. If I die, this is why I love\neverybody.\nHopefully you're out there.\n&gt;&gt; Well, we're going to push forward.\n&gt;&gt; So, let's just get let's just get it\n&gt;&gt; Nothing matters.\n&gt;&gt; What are we getting done?\n&gt;&gt; We're going to get this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] ride\n&gt;&gt; We're rolling. Bye.\n&gt;&gt; Going to get some.\n&gt;&gt; We're now 36 hours into the race. The\nrain has stopped, but it's left the\nroads muddy and impassible in some\nareas.\nMeanwhile, to the south, a few riders\nwho narrowly missed the storm push on\nfor a Thursday night finish.\n&gt;&gt; Congratulations, my friend.\n&gt;&gt; My god, that was awesome. That was a\ngreat day. And yesterday was a good day.\nHey, you're here.\n&gt;&gt; You staying up late?\n&gt;&gt; Yes. We got you your watermelon.\n&gt;&gt; That's so sweet.\nThat was That was hard.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that was like the hardest one yet.\n&gt;&gt; I think we're going to grab it here.\n&gt;&gt; Congratulations.\n&gt;&gt; I was I did lose a flip-flop in the\ncrazy stuff. We slept like 12 hours last\nnight.\n&gt;&gt; Oh, so good.\n&gt;&gt; I'm pretty rested to go.\n&gt;&gt; So good. So, yesterday was like a full\ninferno\n&gt;&gt; around like midday.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. Then we made it to the lake at\nlike 5:30. We walked to the cash and\nsave and got like a pint of ice cream\nlike 10 steps across the street to the\nmotel. My plan was, you know, to get\nthrough the first 100, turn it into like\nnight night attacks cuz I don't really\nwant to do the heat, you know. I got a\nbig big big breakfast and then decided\nuh that I was going to go wait it out in\na hotel. Fell asleep from like 8:00 to\nprobably about 4:00 this afternoon. I'm\ngoing to try to make it to Still Water\nby morning.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, let's do it. We'll see y'all.\n&gt;&gt; Trade safe.\n&gt;&gt; Woohoo.\n&gt;&gt; Nice work.\n&gt;&gt; One more.\nOh my gosh.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Oh my god.\n&gt;&gt; Damn\nyou guys from a mile away. It was\nawesome.\n&gt;&gt; We're loud. Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Oh yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n&gt;&gt; You did it.\n&gt;&gt; All right. All right. Well, never have\nto do that again.\n&gt;&gt; You did so good. I've never done\nanything for 38 hours.\n&gt;&gt; That's so funny. Incredible.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, just think about that. Like\n&gt;&gt; that's a long time.\n&gt;&gt; Best of luck.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm sure.\n&gt;&gt; Morning from Still Water. It is Friday\nmorning about 48 hours into the mega\nmids south. A lot happened last night. A\nlarge thunderstorm uh kind of engulfed\nthe whole north side of the course. A\nlot of people got hit with heavy rain,\n50 mph winds, and uh even some hail and\nLake Pane sustained quite a bit of\ndamage. There was a group of riders that\nwere coming around the north part of the\ncourse. They had to hunker down, walk\ntheir bikes for a while. They ended up\npushing all the way through the night.\nWe've been watching them kind of knock\nout these last 60 miles all night on the\ntracker and we're excited to see them\ncome in.\nThanks to your cats, man. They had all\nthe belief that we could do it. It was\namazing. It was amazing.\nI think it was ultra mega. It was\nperfect.\n&gt;&gt; Come here.\n&gt;&gt; Good job, buddy.\n&gt;&gt; You did great.\n&gt;&gt; I can't do all this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]\n&gt;&gt; That was probably one of the most\nspectacular bike rides I've ever had\nlast night.\n&gt;&gt; A little extra.\nYeah, we did it.\n&gt;&gt; We did it, dude. We did it.\n&gt;&gt; We did it. We picked him up\nlike\n&gt;&gt; unless you wanted\n&gt;&gt; under 48 hours.\n&gt;&gt; Show the sharks.\nI love that you two ended up together.\nThis is the best [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I ever heard.\nAnd we're right back out on course to\nsee who's going to finish this route. We\ncome across Kyle and Anga, a couple of\nguys who have ridden a lot of ultras\ntogether. We learned Kyle's been dealing\nwith a broken spoke and low tire\npressure since mile 60.\n&gt;&gt; Probably since fifth grade.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. Tried little BMX mountain bikes\nwhen we were kids and now we're doing\nthis stuff. It's been good. Nice\njob.\n&gt;&gt; Then we caught up with Dwayne and Lance,\nanother pair of single speeders coming\ninto Glenco. Almost done. And it got\nwindy heavy and we saw a building and we\ntook cover behind it for a while just\noutside. It blocked the wind\nand it was about 1:00 in the morning. So\nrunning through that mud was pretty\ntough but full experience. So here we\nare. We got in like 2:45 and then set\nout this morning about 7:00.\nThat's graceful.\n&gt;&gt; It was beautiful at uh at our campsite\nlast night. Not a drop of rain. Got\nanother 9 and 1/2 hours sleep in.\n&gt;&gt; And leaving West out of the camp this\nmorning, we had a rainbow all the way\nacross like like\n&gt;&gt; going right through the middle.\n&gt;&gt; Through the middle.\n&gt;&gt; That's awesome.\n&gt;&gt; So yeah.\n&gt;&gt; All right. Can I get the uh five piece\ncrispy tenders meal with a\n&gt;&gt; root 44 limeade?\nSo\n&gt;&gt; I make my rides and fries\nthat ranch burger, but it's slam.\n&gt;&gt; As everyone presses on towards Blankeno,\nwe encounter our own limitations.\nBut we're from here, so we know how to\nstay cool. After we gas up, we head back\nout to see who we can find on course.\nHey,\n&gt;&gt; I woke up this morning at like 1:00 a.m.\ntrying to eat the heat. And I've just\nbeen pushing ever since since this rain\ncame through. It's been nice and cool.\nSo, just haven't stopped. That's the\nonly thing on my mind right now is like\nthe next stop. And\n&gt;&gt; I feel uh like I'm in a nap really hard.\nThat was really special time.\n&gt;&gt; It was so good.\n&gt;&gt; We had really, really tough times and we\nhad really incredible times.\n&gt;&gt; He's a crazy good pilot.\n&gt;&gt; This is a crazy good stoer. Like it's\nincredible.\n&gt;&gt; We We cleared everything.\nsand. All the rocks, all the mud.\n&gt;&gt; Good job.\nYou got your girlfriend tonight.\nheat.\nNice job, man.\n&gt;&gt; Thank you so much. Thank you for\n&gt;&gt; you, man. Congratulations.\n&gt;&gt; Great.\n&gt;&gt; What's up, Rich?\nIt's been a long\nway earlier.\nI\nHeat. Heat.\nSaturday morning was the opening day of\nregistration for the Midsouth 2025. So,\nwe threw a party at District Bicycles\nand invited everyone to come through and\nget registered.\nWith a lot of extra people in town\nhanging out of district, it was a really\ngreat atmosphere. As the final riders\ngot closer to town,\n&gt;&gt; dude.\nFeel good. Feel good.\n&gt;&gt; Probably 64 even.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's more even.\n&gt;&gt; Sweet. Yeah, a little before 1:00 a.m.\n&gt;&gt; My longest ride before Mega Mids South\nwas like 83 miles.\n&gt;&gt; What?\n&gt;&gt; First, I guess we can call it a century,\nbut 99ish\nmiles Wednesday, did 70 m second day,\nand then did 140 to get here last night.\n&gt;&gt; So, two two centuries in like 3 days.\nThank you.\nThank you, girl.\nSomething's coming.\n&gt;&gt; I need a bottom bracket.\n&gt;&gt; You're rolling. You're rolling. You're\nrolling.\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for being here. Yeah.\nSick ride. Good job.\n&gt;&gt; You're welcome.\n&gt;&gt; All right. Love it.\n&gt;&gt; Oh, am I welcome.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. Thanks for\n&gt;&gt; All right, let's ride bikes.\nThere's what I was expecting.\nI had an honest and I like Rickley.\n&gt;&gt; Morning.\nYou're getting tempted to ride faster,\nbut I was like, \"No.\"\n&gt;&gt; It's not what you plan for.\n&gt;&gt; Don't overdo yourself. Cuz I'll tell you\nthis, if I was one of those people\ntrying to get it done in like 24, 48,\n30, whatever hours math, I would have\ndropped out. Like\n&gt;&gt; the fact that I knew that I had like a\ncampsite at the end of each day was all\nthat kept me up.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you did your thing.\n&gt;&gt; I love it.\n&gt;&gt; Thank you guys for having me.

story of the\nMid-South and the weather\nbut if it's like this it's going to be\nbeautiful and and fast and which helps\nthe climbing too\nyou know for sure\nand then and then you can fly on the\ndescents and catch that momentum on the\nnext climb because there's going to be\none coming\nevery time so\nI think we found it like beautiful mix\nof\nof the of the most Red Dirt that we

do that and I like stop for a\nsecond and I remember that a lot of\npeople haven't seen it at nearly as much\nas like I have or we have\nman it's yeah I think it's gonna be\nreally exciting yeah the front half is\nI think just so familiar to me but the\nback the back half a lot of stuff I just\ndon't ride that often yeah so I'm really\nexcited about that yeah and the\nrowdiness of it all and we found some\ngood stuff to add yeah but that front\nthat b Road at what is that mile 40 I\nthink you're gonna we're gonna split\nsome people up on that climb yeah\nbecause you have to pick a line yeah\nyadika said it he was like you have to\ncommit to a line on that climb and it's\nyou can't really come out of it because\nthe road's so bad yeah you guys took a\nlittle tumble back there did you film\nany of that yeah it's very fun so single\ntracks ahead\nlike Mercury mile 89.\nit's pretty good it just keeps getting\nbetter\nso what'd you say there's about probably\nwould you say 7 000 feet

the climbing's\nreally dispersed I think it's really\nlike spread out yeah um so it doesn't it\nI don't know maybe not maybe it is more\non the front end like you'd say like\nyeah front 50 is I'd say it's sort of\nmajority of the climate is but don't\nbefore because second half definitely\nhas has it too but\njust be ready to climb and enjoy them\nyou know take it easy it was definitely\nfun it's

all our\nbacks trying not to stop we have\njust there\ngo oh my gosh all right we are less than\nlike a minute out but um I'm going to\nmake a couple people say a couple things\nbefore we leave because what's an extra\ncouple minutes\nanyway first and foremost I just want to\nsay thank you so much for all of you for\ncoming um we had no idea what to expect\nwhen we decided to actually make this a\nthing and year one minimal time putting\nit together minimal time for planning\nand look at how many of you showed up so\nseriously give yourselves a round of\napplause thank you for coming thank you\nfor being\nhere um thank you to our whole team to\nTyler to Crystal to\nJosh without them this wouldn't be\nhappening this would not be being put on\nat all um thank you to Tanner Fredy for\npainting this beautiful mural on the\nwindow\nall right we just started and we're\nstarting off really\nslow I don't know\nwhat I don't know who's going to be fast\nwho's trying to race it who's trying to\nbike pack but like everybody's just\nchill so at this point the pace car left\nus and and I started just really\naccelerating and leaving the main group\nI didn't really understand what was\ngoing on if anybody was going to try and\nchase me or I think I was solo for maybe\nto 15 minutes or so and then all of a\nsudden David comes here he goes he\npasses me right\nthere so then now I know okay I'm going\nto have some competition this is going\nto be\nrace um he he's accelerating pretty hard\nso I'm not really chasing him right here\nyou can kind of see him off in the\ndistance so this is sort of a\npre glimpse of what's going to be\nhappening for the rest of the race I'm\ngoing to be chasing him a\nlot all right so the guy in first place\nhe he won the East Texas\nShowdown uh he has like a full Arrow\nhelmet\non the guy in second place I've never\nseen him before but uh I there's nobody\nelse behind me for now like I mean that\nI can\nsee we're less than 10 mies\nin it's going to be fun\nall right I'm in uh fifth place right\nnow between mile 15 and 20 somewhere in\nthere still feeling good\num so I got passed by two guys but I see\nsomebody else so I might go from 5ifth\nto 4th\num so I got a text from my friend Jeremy\nhe said I'm only oh I need to check for\ncars here no cars said I'm only 4\nminutes behind the next person so I'm\ngoing to push really hard and see if I\ncan catch\nsomebody still feeling good I don't I'm\nnot sure what mile it is it's been\nalmost 3 hours though all right so I'm\nstill in fifth Place uh it's been about\n3 hours\nis\num I don't know I've been thinking about\nit and trying to figure out how I'm\ngoing to do and like I'm out of breath\nmaybe I should re-record this uh yeah\nI'm climbing a big hill it's really\nhilly\nhere yeah I'm going to try and re-record\nthis this\nidea so I have high hopes for doing good\nin this race because I'm in fifth place\nafter 3 hours so the the other two races\nI've done were un Bund XL and uh the\nGarment long\nvoyage and in both of those in the\nbeginning I dropped back pretty far for\none reason or the other and then like\nafter halfway through the race I start\nreally passing people so if I'm still in\nfifth and it's been a few hours I got a\nreally good feeling about this race ni\nokay so mile\n50 somebody left the water table out oh\nwas so nice so I don't have to stop now\n60 so it's heating up a\nlittle I think I have a maybe 45 miles\nthe next\nall right so Oklahoma drivers are super\nawesome they like I just had a truck\ncompletely pull over and let me\npass so Texas are good but like I did a\nrace in Nebraska and they speed up by\nyou when they're going by and then\nKansas they're pretty crazy over there\ntoo so\nthis is\nawesome hopefully there's no one behind\nme I'm not\nlooking uh I did the first stop uh I\nthink it was like 63 miles\nI passed at least one\nperson there's like a there's like other\npeople out in the course and it's kind\nof\nconfusing but I think what's happening\nis they started earlier um but uh yeah\nso I don't know it might be was fifth I\ndon't know I'm like either like third or\nfourth right now feeling good\nI'm in second place right\nnow I don't know it's probably 70 75\nmiles I haven't looked um\nso the first place guy super\nfast but\nuh the race isn't over yet I usually do\nbetter later on in the day anyways so as\nlong as he doesn't put hours on me I\nmight have a chance to catch him later\nI'm not going to give up to get first\nbut I'd be super happy with second\nit's 96° out here feeling good it's like\n86 mil\n98° still feeling good I'm chugging\nwater\num I'm chugging water as fast as I can\ntrying to time it for the each gas\nstation I haven't skipped any stops yet\ncuz it's so\nhot but feeling good still I got to\ncatch that guy so I'm on Mile 88 and I'm\n2 mil behind first\nplace I'm still feeling good it's still\nhot but I'm feeling good I\nhave I think I'm going to be be able to\nat least catch him at some point in this\nrace so we'll\nsee I saw the first place guy coming out\nof the gas station as I went in and it\nprobably took me 3 and 1/2 minutes in\nthe gas station\nso I've been stopping a lot more than I\nnormally do in these races every single\ngas station I stopped at like\n190 no wait I stopped at ' 96 and then I\nfound one at like\n107 and I stopped again cuz it is like\n99° I am burning through water like my\nidea is these shops I mean I'm losing\ntime but if I get dehydrated I think\nI'll lose even more so I'm still feeling\ngood just stopping a lot and getting\nwater can't wait for the night\n[Applause]\nhi GPS is it's 101 right now holy\ncow it is crazy\no\nn\nokay so first place guy uh he got a\npuncher I gave him two tubes he had a\npump and uh and I left\nhim so uh I'm in first place but\ndepending if he fixes his tube we'll see\nif you can catch up I'm going to go all\nout right now I was like dead it's weird\nI was like dead inside I was going 7 m\nhour I'm going 18 right now cuz I got to\nput I got to put some room this dude is\nso fast I got to put some room between\nus if he gets his his tire\nfixed so I'm taking away away from this\nrace how powerful your mind\nis before I had ran into the David I had\njust started slowing down for the maybe\nthe 10 miles before I I found him um I\nhad run out of water I couldn't find the\nwater at Mile 200 I was getting\ndehydrated at night it wasn't a serious\nthing but it was slowing me down a lot\nas soon as I ran into\nhim um I figured out you know what was\nwrong and I didn't want to win by that I\ndidn't want to win by him having\nmechanical so so I was like what do you\nneed I gave him I gave him two tubes\nmade sure he had a pump and uh I mean\nthat's all I could do so then after that\nI just I wouldn't fall I went full on\nout\num I was I went from 7 mes an hour to\nlike going between 15 to 20 for for\nhours it was like a brand new race it\nwas like the beginning of the race so\nwhat my idea was was that maybe it took\nhim 30 minutes to fix his tube I don't\nknow sometimes it can take that long and\nhe was going to have to make up the\ntime and I didn't want to let him I I\ngot that I got the idea in my head that\nI was going to get first and I it was\nlike a whole new race and I was not\ngoing to give it up easy\nthroughout the whole race my gravel\nfriends were G uh Levi and Jeremy were\ngiving me\nupdates about where I was in the race\nhow far away I was from first from the\nfirst place guy and it just given me\nmotivation to uh to catch him because I\ncould kind of see where I was whether it\nwas 5 minutes away 20 minutes away um at\nsome points I was only a few minutes\naway\num you know it gave me that extra push\nto try and uh stay at least stay close\nto him\nbecause um I was feeling good and I\ndidn't know how um I didn't know how\nDavid was feeling\nbut in my mind it was just keep pushing\nand don't let off don't give him any\nslack because he may crack I didn't know\nat the time what was going to happen all\nI knew was I have to keep pushing and I\nhave to go as hard as I can\ngot that up\nthat yeah amazing congratulations thank\nyou thank you\nguys can I get your fresh water Coke or\nSprite uh can have all of them\noh",

snow\nmelted\nit snowed like a couple inches yesterday\nbut it's all gone\nso there's a person in shorts that is a\ngrave choice\nso we'll see how it goes gonna be cold\nto start and then maybe muddy i'm not\nreal sure so\nlooking forward to it\nquestion mark question mark\nhere we go\nthis guy's excited\nmid-south days here\nit is cold\nboys and girls\ngonna be a chilly start\nand maybe a muddy\nrest of the day we'll see\nsnow's gone\nbut it's in the 20s or so maybe they\npushed start back to 9am so that was\nnice for the\ncold but uh\ndepending on the day goes i may be\nfinishing in the dark\nlast time i was at this event the world\nkind of shut down a couple of days later\nso\nnice to be back\nit's gonna be a long day out there i\nhave a feeling\nand stable things that exist in this\nworld\nyou may entertain\nstill really grouped up\ncold at the start\nstarting to warm up a little bit now\nthough\na few sections growl\nsee a big old bunch of people in rural\noklahoma\nless than 100 miles to go\nabout an hour and a half in still bumper\nto bumper so grabbing some food stopping\nfor a second\nproblem with the uh\nbigger events man\nyou're in a pack for like half of it\nkind of gets old but\nwarming up a little little snap\ncould be a beautiful day\nwow\nabout 23 miles in\nit's going well so far\njumps warmed up so pretty comfortable\nout here\npretty dry too\ngoing to a point where there's some gaps\nbetween people here and there so\nthat helps a little\nso far clean and dry but i don't think\nthat's gonna last\nmost of the snow is gone\nsome snow in spots with trees and stuff\nbut uh a couple punches yesterday was\ngone by the afternoon so\ncan't complain about conditions\ncomplain about the engine\nbetter than the other option\ngot me feeling like a trap in the sand\ni can't be reborn\npretty nice road actually\na little muddy\ntell me\nabout 10 miles out from checkpoint\ndoing some climbing\nand i'm feeling that\nit's going okay though\nsurprisingly\ni have a feeling i'm gonna pay for this\nlater but\ni think all right\nprogressing nicely\nwhat's up guys\nthere he is right back there right here\nhow's it going\nit's good\na little easy so that's why\ndoes that mean\ngood luck be careful\ni'm a monster\nwait a minute what you're talking about\nhow we going\ngood how are\nyou huh you know\nall right i suppose\ntake your trust\nthat's me\nthat's so sick\nis\nhey\nfeet\nmy heat's like an oven on a crack\njust finishing up a really nice stretch\nof road\nsomewhere around 50.\nwent through the uh\nchamois butter checkpoint\nreally in a great road but man it's\ntaken out of me\na bunch of climbing in this section and\npretty steep so\ni'm feeling it now\nwe are a long way from stillwater\nabout as far as we're going to get\nstill moving but\nlegs are getting toasty already\n57.9 in\nsaying that's how they wrote eating\nprotein balls gives you an idea of how\ni'm feeling\ni'm not totally cracked but i'm pretty\nclose\nbad news is the wind kicked up so we're\nfighting some wind on the way home\nfour\ni'm wrong again sorta\nat least covering ground but i'm not\nreally flying here\nwe're getting close to this lake i think\nwe turn south here soon which\ngonna give us more wind\nwe'll see\noh\nstraight into the wind\nthe fair amount of climbing wide open\ni don't know how long it's been\nand i don't want to look\nbecause it would just be depressing to\nsee how\nlittle we've gone in that stretch but uh\ndamn\nlike 70 something miles in\nand i am struggling\ni've had to stop a few times and stretch\ntry and loosen up my back\ni'm just having trouble turning the\npedals right now\nthere's gonna be a long\n25 miles\nfrom here\nand the wind is still blowing\nof course\nwell misery's about to start again but\nthat was a nice oasis\ni give the oasis two thumbs up\nlook at this bike ride\nless than that comes up\ncounting down the miles\nand that sun is\ndropping fast\ni don't know\ni don't know if i'm gonna make it\nuh\ncatching a tiny bit of a second wind\nfinally\nspeeding up a little bit\ni think just because i'm getting closer\nto the end and i know it\nthe suffer is real today\nnice little stretch here at the end with\nsome tailwind\nheading back east\nwe're within eight miles or so\nmaking some good time finally i'm hoping\ni'm gonna beat sunset but we'll see\npretty close to another\nmid-south in the books\nanother reminder\nthat i'm always in bad shape at this\ntime of year\nbeautiful roads though\nplus fun people some of those are oasis\noasis away side\npretty sweet\npretty fun\nso props to everyone who made that\nhappen\nbefore i forget thanks to my partner my\nwife\nfor being my support again this event\nshe gets to spend the day\nwrangling our golden retriever\nand exploring the countryside of rural\noklahoma so\nthanks cass\nalmost home\noh it's gonna be close\na couple three miles or so\nman\nwe might beat her\nreal close to cramping so\nwe can't do it\nalmost time\nhe's excited\nlet's go celebrate\ncongratulations\nokay you did it\nhow do you feel terrible\nhorrible\nhow is the last 60-something\nrough\nwindy\ngilly\nmorning after\nmid-south 100.\ni don't think they make a pill for that\nyet\ngot a little rough this morning\nthought to give you a quick breakdown of\nthe event\nup into the the main checkpoint first 40\npretty easy\nwe got a bit of a tailwind it was cold\nat the start 20 or so been pretty smooth\nin fact i think i even said something to\nthe checkpoint it's been too easy\nand we're gonna have to pay for that and\nwe certainly did\nleaving the checkpoint somewhere around\n45 or 50 climbing started\nuh and it was uh\nyeah it definitely got to me there\nplenty of climbing there for a little\nwhile and i think i got a little bit\nbehind on my\nuh nutrition and heating so that didn't\nhelp things\nand then we started heading west and\nsouth into the headwind\ncross head and headwind so that was uh\nmade for a rough go from like for me\nto be honest from 55 to 60 to like\n80 something until we headed back east\nthat was pretty rough um but\nglad to see i kept moving and i made it\nthrough\nhad to take a few stops there at one\npoint i was laying on the side of the\nroad in the ditch watching the clouds go\nby kind of thing\nrallied a little bit\nmade it to the uh shrimp oasis was uh\nglorious\nso props to anyone that made that happen\nthey had like a quonset tp situation\nwith\nscratch was there and a bunch of food\nfor you they had grilled cheese but the\nlime was too long i would really like\nthe grilled cheese but uh\ni thought it was following my chance to\ntaste a uh\nallen lim created uh\nrice cake in person i've tried it a few\ntimes myself it never turned out that\ngreat but uh\ntoo slow i was too slow they were out of\nthe rice cakes already by then but still\nthat tram oasis was awesome and a\nlifesaver for a lot of people me\nincluded before we headed straight into\nthe headwind for like 10 miles with some\nclimbing so\nit added some nice motivation\nanyway headed back east there last like\n10 or so miles were\npretty straightforward pretty easy\nalthough it sounds like there was a\nwreck at the front\nuh other event somewhere along there\nwhich is interesting it wasn't much for\nroads there so it must have been getting\npretty\ngetting after pretty good so\nall in all happy to be done\n100 miles this time of year in early\nmarch is uh\na bit much for me\ni've done this event three times now and\nevery time i say that so\ni don't know maybe this time will be the\nlast time\ni think uh flynn hill's gravel ride is\ncoming up in a few other events going to\ntry and get some time on the tandem\nagain with my wife um been kind of\nfocusing on getting ready for this event\nand getting my surly ready but time to\nget back on the tandem put some miles in\nthere\nso that's what's next on the uh books\nbut uh\nyeah appreciate you tuning in if you\nhaven't done so already i'd really\nappreciate if you would like comment and\nespecially subscribe\num back at gravel pack and we'll see you\nnext time\nmy
