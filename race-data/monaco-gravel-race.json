I started to fade and couldn't maintain the early pace.\" The race becomes extremely demanding after ~60km, suggesting 68 miles hits the sweet spot between substantial and manageable. Similar distance to Crusher in the Tushar."

        "explanation": "Stöckli describes \"the relentless vibrations and shocks during the climbs were tough on the muscles\" through terrain featuring the Col de Braus gravel tracks and technical descents on both asphalt and gravel. The course demands serious bike handling skills through Mercantour's varied mountain terrain. Among the most technical in gravel, on par with Badlands."

April racing in the Mercantour region between Mediterranean coast and mountains creates variable spring conditions. No specific weather incidents reported from the 2025 inaugural edition, suggesting manageable but potentially unpredictable conditions depending on elevation and exposure. Similar climate challenges to SBT GRVL."

Limited research shows the community aspect, but the barrier to entry suggests quality over quantity."

        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Elite winners Schmidt and Aguirre dominated with significant time gaps - Aguirre won by 5 minutes, Schmidt by 3:43.

      "should_you_race": "If you can handle 121 feet of climbing per mile on short, punchy ascents, this is your European gravel vacation with World Championship qualification upside. The Mercantour park setting means you're climbing through postcard scenery instead of Kansas cornfields.

Then uh we have 2,6 or 700 m\nclimbing. I hope I brought the climbing\nlegs with me. I'm not sure. We see. And\nfor the rest uh show must go on. Here is\nthe\nbike. Are the bike\nready with one with 45\nmm in the front.\nThe Schwab G1 Erics Pro.\nand a 46 chain ring single speed\nXPR. I lost a piece of this already. And\nin the front something more rolling,\nthe G1 RS 45 mm.\nAlso, best bike on the\nmarket. Too much.\nYes. 1 hour to the start.\nAn hour 55 minutes.\nHeat\nup\nhere.\nHeat. Heat.\nNice. Come on. Come on.\nO, what was this? Ah, look the dirt.\nThe bike is super\nfast. The wheels are really good. Like I\nhad the 45 in front and 40 behind. Uh\nmaybe next time I ride with the 45\n45, but it feels like amazing. The the\nthe bike is like a road bike. It's on\ngravel. Uh it's it's really really fast.\nMy race was like Yeah. till the second\nlap, till the second\nuh long climb, I was fighting for\nposition five like we was a big group\nand\nthen on the on the long climb in the\nmiddle part I was I was standing still\nlike standing still.\nYeah. Uh Simon was really strong. He\nfight for I think for the win what I\nsee. But then he had a flat tire.\nIn 50\nminutes should work.\nYep. day, huh? Day,\nhuh? Race went\nwell. The podium was\nsecured until 7ks to go. The last case\nof downhill when I had a bad flat\ntire, we had like more than two minute.\nYeah, two minute advantage on the force.\nSo I could put two of\nthese small plug in my\ntire seal. Bump it up. Start again. uh\ncatch\nthe caught the the\npodium. I caught Gaffurini or what's his\nname from\nSwat in the downhill and when I when I\narrive when I cut caught him then I had\na second flat tire. The plug went away.\nSo I hope they have a shower but I'm not\neven sure they have a shower here. So\nyeah, maybe I bring some mud from Monaco\nback to\nValvalis. Yes. And that's all\nI was trying to\nuse to put a tube in my tire in the end\nto go home to reach the finish line as\nthe last elite\nrider.\nSali, next time will be better. I hope\nwe kick some asses in tracker for sure.\nEh, I get my revenge. A new brand new\ntires in the back and then\ncapamush. You see it's\nfantastic. Okay.\n[Laughter]\nThis is gra my friend. How was the day?\nThank you very",

          "transcript": "[Music]\nhello and welcome to the 2024 balero UCI\ngravel World Championships from Flanders\nand the forest of Brent here in Belgium\nit's Sunday it's the men's Elite race it\nstarted at 12:00 Central European Time\ntoday and it is well and truly underway\nout on the roads of Belgium\n251 starters today in the elite race 182\nkm of racing and all six of the podium\nRiders from the previous two gravel\nWorld Championships on the start line\ntoday and the RO is heading out from hle\nhere in now Belgium just able to take in\nthat scenery on their ride across many\nof the Riders out wrecky in the course\nduring the course of Thursday Friday and\non Saturday the weather really good\nthough very similar to yesterday well it\nis indeed and the weather is great\nconditions as we are indeed looking at\nthe Basilica of s Mar you can see the\nstarters lined up behind and it's more\nthan the elite Riders because there's\nfour age group categories going out\nbehind the men's Elite category today 15\nminutes behind them and over 2 and half\nthousand Riders this weekend across 49\ncountries racing in 15 different\ncategories now the previous two world\nchampions are up on your screen will it\nbe one of those two again or will we see\na different Rider on the top spot today\nand before the race start preparations\nfor our Riders Valerie Bas known for his\nformula one driving skills as well as\nhis bike riding a really Keen gravel\nracer\nuh taking to the St EV at 35 to 39 age\ncategory lots of detailed preparation\ntire pressure is going to be crucial saw\na lot of incidences with issues with\npuncture issues in that women's race\nyesterday so we're going to see who has\ngot the start who has got their\npreparation absolutely nailed the\nBelgian Squad very strong here y\nbackland in the mix yesper Sten warming\nup getting himself already one of the\nhot favorites here today A lot of people\ntipping him to be in and on the podium\nCy cross Superstar is a bit a rider who\nwill be looking for the technical\nsections maybe struggle with the\nultimate power of the big road guns but\na very strong cycle cross emphasis to\nthe hot favorites here with people like\nt buut v as well Che here Tim meria\nanother of those Riders who's known for\nhis Sprint power on the road as well as\nhis cyc cross skills and that's going to\nbe that mix that's required because it\nis a very very fast course here today\nGiani Vish and floran Vish both on the\nstart line and they are going to be\nlooking to take on the hot favorite\ntoday because our hot favorite uh the\nman who is tipped by everybody to be up\nthere is the one and only Matthew\nvandero he is likely to be the rider\ntaking on\neverybody else well he's got the orange\nglasses on to match that orange Jersey\nfrom the Netherlands but the number of\nBelgian Riders here today the strength\nand depth is going to be hard to beat it\nis and Flor visha could be right up\nthere they've all got to beat Matthew\nmic the leader at the end and the winner\nof the penultimate race to this the race\nof the Championships in venito\n2023 all right is lined up on the start\nline the front row of the grid you can\nsee a long look across from Matty Modric\nat Matthew vandero behind our Elite\nRiders you can see the age group Riders\ngetting ready to start as well but look\nat the profusion of blue on the start\nrow on the front of the grid here a\nRiders away at 12:00 setting off to head\nout on to the race route from H this\namazing shot down of the roundabout\nrders going both sides streaming out and\nthis is where having that front row the\ngrid is really really critical oh\ncompletely because they come through H\nand out of town and on to the canal\nsection where we saw the women's race\nyesterday but you can see the crowds\nlining the streets lining the canal\nBanks and the Riders wide across the\nroad trying to get a key position into\nthis tight corner and this corner is\ngoing to be critical look at the Log Jam\nas we go and it's only getting worse\nthere a rider stationary on the left\nside on the inside Riders on the right\nhand side trying to avoid getting swept\ninto the side of the they've got to keep\nsome momentum and keep some movement and\nriders with nowhere to go on the inside\nbeing at the front getting a good start\nout from the grid a really frantic race\nand you can see this Apex there are\nRiders just jammed up against the\nbarriers this is going to put a dent in\nto a lot of rers chances and you can see\nthe damage that's being done here taking\na look down this course here look at the\nvolume of riders are still coming out of\nthe forest as the leaders come in\ntowards us you can see the Slovenian\nteam the Belgian team the Netherlands\nteam pushing Riders up on to the front\nhere those jerseys mostly to the four\nand they race in this early stage but\nthey've taken advantage of that g\nthey've taken advantage of having a fast\nstart one or two French jerseys one or\ntwo the jerseys of the Riders from Great\nBritain in there as they come down uh in\nin underneath the bridge here they going\nin and along the side of the canal once\nagain big pack only so many places you\ncan go you can see vandero just sitting\nback in what is about sixth wheel at the\nmoment keeping out of trouble and that\nis so critical at this stage as we come\ndown in and through to Wars the side\nhere this amazing mural at the side of\nthe course no time to look at that for\nour Riders well the Enchanted Forest\nit's the largest mural\nin Europe along this canal District\nhere these roers come down in this left\nhand turn just starting to sweep them\nout a big attack coming and this looks\nlike this is come from eing so eing on\nthe front pulling the clear mat modish\nat the moment and no response from\nbehind the netherland's teammate not\ngoing to go chase this down this is\nclearly team T it's coming into play\nearly on it's an early Breakaway It's a\nLong Way to the Finish Line short this\nwon't stick well the Riders continue to\npush into the helos Forest this amazing\nforest here with so much fantastic\ntracks and trails really historic in the\nhelos Forest a very protected area as\nwell some of the sections not able for\nour Spectators to enter because of the\nsensitive nature of the floor and fora\naround the area but the group are really\nflying into this they are indeed and why\nacross the track the pace has come off\nthis group now after that very very fast\nstart and the Riders know that if you go\nto the side of the track here you're\ngoing to be in what is really deep mud\nthere's a lot of tree MCH down there\nvandero sitting on the front at the\nmoment keeping himself out of trouble\nall of these Riders know they've got to\nstay safe at the moment the helos Forest\nsitting between the first and second\ntime checks out on course and that\nfrantic start starting to do damage move\nfrom the helos Forest towards the Onan\nForest well Belgium's largest Beach\nforest and that's where the Riders\nheaded next they also headed past the\nRoyal Lodge the large green Flatlands\nonce a horse RAC trck now it is gravel\nracing that is taking place here and as\nwe came in through by the Royal Lodge\ninto to the forest leading group of\nriders really started to P clear 30\nriders in the leading group as we came\nin and through into the sodian forest\ninto this big long Forest section this\nsection takes us right the way through\nheading pretty much from about 42k right\nthe way through to just a shy of\n65k now the Belgian Squad drilling it on\nthe front and answer coming from behind\njust starting to drift clear though the\nthree Riders from Belgium the trio\nopening up a little Gap very quick\nresponse and it's the action here\nstarting to break up you see behind more\nand more gaps starting to open but this\ngroup of about 30 Riders leading as they\ncame through the 39 km marker heading in\nto the zonan vo which is our next big\nForest section you can see this leading\ngroup and the profusion of belan jerseys\nin there it's got to be 50% of that\ngroup is made up of one nation oh they\nare indeed as they sweep through and\nit's a big group at this point in time\nbut the stretch is on and the race now\nreally getting underway as we made our\nway in through the main section of\nforest we came out the other side to the\nTuan Park where the Africa museum is now\nthe park and Gardens just to the south\nof the Africa museum a little bit more\nformal the tracks and trails a little\nbit less technical a little bit smoother\nand as we came out of the Africa museum\nForest we started to see another move\nbeing made on the front of the race and\nwhile\nthe belgians have been dominating the\nfront of the park the Netherlands Squad\nhave got some big Firepower Matthew\nvandero on the attack as they came out\nfrom the T Park heading out and away\nfrom the\n70.6k marker at this point a 30 second\nGap from vandero to stven well Vander\nthird in the world championships in\n2022 not part and parcel of the race in\n20 23 and issues for T SP to puncture\nfor him to that front wheel got to get\nthe wheel out super fast fortunately\ngetting some assistance really quickly\nyou can only do this in those areas\nwhere the assistance is permitted you\ncan see here just getting that front\nwheel dropped in quite a number of\npunctures the Riders really pushing the\nlimit of what the kit will take what\nimpact what damage is done versus how\nlight they can go lighter you go more\nlikely you have to get an impact\npuncture more likely are to have issues\nnow the chasing group behind trying to\nclose the gap down there were 19 Riders\nbehind Swift having made his way back\ninto that big chase group but that lead\nof vandero was out at 30 seconds coming\ndown as we went in to the 82 km Mark\nthat Gap would come down again yeah Gap\nhad come down to 15 seconds at the 82 km\nmarker eight riders in that chase group\nand Johnny the rider in danger off the\nback of that group well things have\nmoved on and the catch was made 88 kilm\n10 riders in the leading group so 10\nriders in the leading group as you can\nsee on your screens more riders coming\nfrom behind chasing in really is a\nattritional war behind the Riders you\ncan't afford to get distance too far as\nwe start to move our way in towards our\nfinal circuit remember this a start lap\nout round H we then cut across from the\ncountryside in towards the main circuit\nwell we've just gone through the 93 km\nMarket in this 182 km race and they are\nindeed all coming back together again at\nthe front of this race we've now got 16\nriders in the leading group and we're\njoining them live now on your screens as\nyou can see already a conversation on\nthe front of this so let's try and take\na little run through of the names in the\nlead group you can just see I think that\nis going to be Conor squ just moving up\non to the front here Ryder who had an\nissue early on in this race made his way\nback up into the group so seven in this\ngroup so it's Maurice vandero Vish\nflowing Vish that is teimo ke Connor\nSwift ASAS for Styer mat Modric tets\nGiani visha Quinton hermans Tim merlia\nlooks like Kevin pan we've got also M\ngodov as well as Lawrence naron and\nGiannis Lindberg r\njust in a contion and then we see a\n10-second Gap to the chasing group T SP\nin there the VAR who had the puncture\nLander long Roger kugan there yuran Blom\nped fos Lou NE that is as it stands at\nthe moment tun in the mix in this\nleading group as well really really\ngoing to be a battle to stay in this\nfront group and your eyesight is not\ndeceiving you there are 11 Belgium\njerseys in that leading group of 16 so\nthe leaders on the way in to a w City\nfinal circuit here this is going to be\nvery very tricky stuff as they go out on\nto the main circuit now one of the key\nthings that we find here is is is we go\nfrom one of the wider sections to one of\nthose narrower sections out on course to\none of those tighter sections as we hit\nthis 86 kilometer marker every time we\nget a pinch point every six every time\nwe go in through we get in trouble\n86.2k to go to the finish and the Riders\nevery time we're going in lining out if\nyou're the back of that group you're\nhaving to break you're having to slow\ndown you're having to accelerate and\nexpend energy now the course that the\nmen are racing today 182 km in total 86\n86 km left two local Loops of Len and\nthat's where our Riders are at the\nmoment they're coming out on the first\nLoop now 60% of this local Loop is the\nsame as was used for the European gravel\nchampionships in October\n2023 and well it does indeed follow the\ngreen belt through some very old\nWoodlands connecting these places uh\nsome paved roads a short steep\nCobblestone climb uh 1.8 km to the end\nof this lap that could well be\ninstrumental on the run into the Finish\nLine the last gravel section of this lap\ncoming 500 M long\nit's finishes 1 km from the Finish\nLine well the pace definitely picking up\nthe early stages of this race were a lot\nsteadier than they are now uh the pace\nnow averaging just shy of 39 km an hour\nbut early on for the first 30 km it was\nsat around 31\nso the group taking a little bit of a\nlook around just seeing the pick up on\nthe front mat M the defending Champion\nwith the number one on his back moving\nup to the front here as we take this\nsweeping left hand turn the trees lining\nthe side lots of very bright sections in\nthe sunshine here lots of very dark\nsections in the shade you've really got\nto pick your line here as we start\nheading onto the wider rows on to the\ncourse now the Riders picking the\noutside line here less rolling\nresistance smoother but\nyou can see that right hand line just a\nlittle bit quicker lots of Advantage\nwith the speed our Riders are traveling\nat at the moment to stay in the draft of\nmeans you're expending less energy we're\ntraveling the average speed so far\nnearly 40 kilm an hour despite being on\nand off road across the gravel across\nthe farm tracks and out in through the\nWoodland now an attack goes on the right\nhand side another move just being made\nhere is this just to ping out uses\nlittle chicane to open up the Gap taking\naway three more Riders at the moment\nwhere will the Chase come from are the\nrest of the group going to be happy\nthere's certainly no Slovenian Jersey up\nin the leading group The belgians also\nstarting to Fire riders across a quick\nlook across here in the lead\ngroup and at the moment I think we're\ngoing to see Swift with a quick flick of\nthe elbow there just trying to get a\nlittle bit more momentum going well it's\na really big drive at the moment and uh\nthe two Riders from the Netherlands\nkeeping the rider from Great Britain\ncompany on the front of the pack as we\nsee a gap now forming in this\ngroup as eight Riders at the front with\na small Gap but the pushes on from the\nBelgian pack on group two closing down\nlittle split starting to open up here\nlittle bit of distance just starting to\nstretch out from the Riders at the\nmoment this is a dangerous moment get\ncaught at the back once this group go on\nthe front if a gap opens up and you're\ncaught on the wrong side you going to be\ndist he's going to expend a lot of\nenergy sitting on the back of the pack\nhere Giani Vish just holding position\nit's a dangerous game to play though\nsitting so far back in that group\nso Lawrence ve in the mix at the moment\nand we're just taking a little bit of a\nlook on the screens uh this big pack at\nthe moment trying to drive on we've just\ngot two of our Netherlands Riders\nsitting behind vandero looking very calm\nand composed and waiting little look\ndown there I think from moric as they\ntake that left hand turn let's see where\nthis uh goes to as we come in now these\nsections of Woodland as we move closer\nin to a water finishing circuit 83 K to\ngo this circuit yesterday very big muddy\nsections at the side it has dried out in\nthe last two days though so we're seeing\nmore dust we are seeing ruts forming as\nwell at the Sid and the latter half of\nthis lap yesterday for the women's race\nvery very muddy it's going to be\ninteresting to see how that has DED you\ncan see the mud on the side looking a\nlot tackier than it was yesterday some\nvery very wet sections particularly when\nin went into the Farmland sections on\nthe run back towards\nLen so modic with his teammate Kover car\nin those Slovenian jerseys just sitting\nin positions five and six two Riders\nfrom the Netherlands on the front two\nRiders from Belgium behind two Riders\nfrom Slovenia and a little bit of a chat\ngoing on a quicker little bit of\nconversation going across there\nfrom uh vandero just has no instruction\nwhat he wants to happen in this race cuz\nyou would think they're going to work\nlittle bit of a check back and there's a\nlot of look over the shoulder there and\nlot of looking back to see the\ncomposition of the group to come down\nthrough the main stre through the corn\nfields taking a left hand turn another\ntransition and the biggest issues are\naround where we Transit from the tracks\nonto tarmac from the tarmac onto the\ntracks and the changing surface is where\nwe saw problems last time we've seen\nproblems again today the Great Britain\nRider just sitting in the back of that\ngroup is Connor Swift he is the lone\nrepresentative of Great Britain in the\nmix yonas Lindberg in there as well\nlooking pretty strong from Denmark at\nthe moment but the groups either side on\nthe very firm sections you don't want to\nstay in the ditch in between for very\nlong not only is the mud and the dirt\nbut you also get concrete slabs cutting\nacross one of those catch if you will\nit's going to be curtains for your\nchances at the front yeah and the uh\nterrain changing constantly on the\ncourse for you know Riders saying for no\nmore than 5 minutes are you on the same\nroad type surface whether that is Road\nwhether that is gravel whether that is\nForest tracks whether it is mixed tracks\nlike you're seeing right now with the\nconcrete paths with the uh grass and mud\nin the middle and constantly changing on\nthe corners into new terrain and next to\nright hand turn those on the right hand\nside taking a tighter line a lot of\nriders having to go slightly wider there\nthey sweet wide for pan heisen there\nissues on the way around there and you\ncan see that that was Lindberg there\nthat was getting tangled up with the\nvirgan squad this is the issue any\nslight mistake here any run if you run\ninto another Rider you just endangering\nthe bike you only need to have a slight\nmechanical with the margins being so\nfine this is a really fast gravel race\ngravel racing encompasses so many\ndifferent types of terrain if you go to\nAmerica you're going to get big\ntechnical monsters absolute Classics in\nthe gravel world if you go race around\nItaly on the gravel or in France on the\ngravel you tend to get faster Rose using\nmore Str bian or Shaman Blan if you go\nout and rise to gravel here in Flanders\nit's generally a mix of farm tracks\nWoodland tracks and trails and because\nof where we are because of the train\nthis is quick and the margins are tight\nwell talking about where we are look at\nthe crowds uh the belgians really know\nhow to enjoy their bike racing\nflanders's an ABS absolute Hub of\ncycling and\nracing so the rod is diving underneath\nthe bridge there with spectat getting a\nfantastic view taking their turn in and\naround this Mart here the Gateway into\nthe mid of the middle wood as they come\naround that turn you can just see as\nthey go in and out the big screens there\nfor the spectators to watch the racing\nbefore the Riders come through\nat the moment the pressure on on the\nfront and at the moment slov starting to\nwind this up on the front again not\nwanting this to go too slowly one long\nline of clear indication the pace just\npicked up I suspect we're going to see\nanother pause before we go into the\nWoodland once again you can just see as\nsoon as somebody's comes off the front\nthere is a swap round the Riders rolling\naround the front of the race well at the\n98.6 km Mar it was Matthew vandero who\ntook the group through in 2 hours 31\nminutes and 55 seconds and I say the\ngroup because the same 16 riders in the\ngroup uh composed at the front of this\nrace now a little bit of a squeeze as\nthey come in you can see going through\nthose bars through the post which\nprevent motorized access in and through\nonly allowance through anybody who's th\nenough to get in between the ballards\nwhile our Riders having to uh negotiate\nthat that thins the group down at the\nmoment you can see the long line of\nriders taking this right hand turn\nalthough it's just about wide enough for\ntwo picking the line picking the fast\nline key little bit of a warning from\nthe Belgian Squad there to the rers\npartway back that we're going through\nmore po into the wood this is where\nthere's a lot more debr down at the Sid\nyou've got to get this line right if you\ndrift off too far it seems innocuous it\nseems like there's nothing then all of a\nsudden boom you're going to hit\nsomething there'll be a big hole it just\nbe that little bit bigger you'll not see\nit in the shade and then you're in\ntrouble left turn around this bent here\njust out again nobody able to break this\nout if the bik can stay with us not hit\ntoo many of the trees on the way through\nhopefully the camera will make it in to\nthe Finish as these Riders make their\nway out and around now the chase behind\nFrederick rman and t b b the rider with\nthat issue H that time Gap it's in the\nminutes it's 2 minutes 25 it's it's not\ngoing to happen let's face it this is\ngoing to be a day of the office to get a\nposition but you're not going to be in\nthe run that group in front too much\nFirepower well and the group Behind\nThese two over a minute back around a\nminute 20 back from them so they've got\na good gap on the group behind but the\ngroup in front the leading group of 16\nRiders at 2 minutes 28 it's not going to\ncome back for them it's not that's just\nnot going to happen we've got so much\nstrength up at the front B strong Rider\nuh he's got R company but I think to be\nhonest that now if you're not in this\ngroup you're not going to make the\nselection you've got to be strong as\nwell and you can just see C Swift there\nto the left of our screens said the only\nR really taking that line until he gets\nfarway up the Riders from the back\nstarting to pop out round trying to get\nin bottles going flying as they come\ndown through this section here and\ncertainly looks to me like ricka doing a\nlot of work here as they make the way up\nthrough hand out for a ball here and\nthat going it to yonas Lindberg so quick\ndrink for\nhim and the dust on the trails really\nstarting to kick up indicating how\nchanging conditions we've got out on the\ncourse today so dry Dusty Trails as well\nas the wet muddy Farmland indeed and it\ndoes change very very quickly we got a\nlot of different TR it is drier than\nyesterday the wind that's been blowing\nthe sun that's been shining has made a\ndifference as we see another push on\nhere only a little bit of a squeeze\nlittle bit of a push out from the corner\nlet's take a little bit of a look who's\ngoing to take up the checks who's going\nto be the first to respond not every\nattack is about going clear often it's\nabout seeing what the rest of the Riders\nare doing is anybody strugling does\nsomebody really want this and he very\nquickly up on to the wheels just seeing\nvanle very quickly moving up in to\nFourth position with that push so did\nMatti modri going into fifth Swift into\nsixth position as they came out of that\ncorner the pressure on and the Riders\nvery quickly looking to close that gap\ndown now Lawrence nasson sitting in the\nback of that group at the moment and\nthat is one of the advantages of having\nlots of riders you get the chance to\nrest your teammates will take a turn on\nthe thr take a turn to attack and of'\ncourse when of your teammates on the\nattack or trying to go clear you're not\ngoing to work no and it really is that\nisn't it you know if we saw a group of\nBelgium Riders go down the front the\nDynamics here would be very very\ninteresting uh the squad working\nstrongly to bring back that early attack\nof Matthew vanderpol uh the rider from\nthe Netherlands who went clear early in\nthe race but since then this group have\nbeen together and there is the advantage\nof working in one group as one big pack\nhere however you won't want to leave\nthis too long so it terms of where we\nare in the race we've gone around that\nHal Loop we went on that long run\nthrough we've been through the finishing\nline for the first time we going round\nthe big circuit for the first time we're\nat the south side of that bigger circuit\nin the mid of wood we come from there up\nonto our next Loop section again a lots\nmore Woodland before we start coming\nback into town uh for the completion of\nthe first circuit this though this\nsection is one of the more technical\nsections because it is so narrow you've\ngot to be in the right place the right\nplace is in those top four well and also\nsome of these Trails now coming back\ntowards lven there is one good line and\nwe've got a big group of 16 Riders at\nthe front of this race and they will all\nbe wanting that line being at the front\nof this group is going to be crucial to\nbeing able to pick where you put your\nwheels really interesting Tim Mur\nsitting about second wheel in as they\ncame in through now pan heisen also\ntrying to move his way up towards the\nfront trying to keep in that key\npositions in at the front third not in\nthis crowd at the back you can't see\nanything this is the biggest problem\nbecause a lot of these tracks have got\nRiders having come through and it will\nhave changed from the previous races\nit'll have changed from the Recon it\nwill have changed from when they were\nout checking what the course was\ndoing well and towards the edges of the\ntrail you can see how rough it is it's\nabsolutely it's it's it's it may not be\nthe big boulders that lot of the\nAmerican gravel Riders grow up on and\nhave' been racing since the start of\ngravel racing but they are really sharp\nthere's a lot of limestone there's a lot\nof sharp sandst GP which has got some\nreally rough edges very easy to catch\nthat very easy to get an impact puncture\non the way through generally that's\ncausing more problems than it is say\nthorns or or gloss any any other Davy\nbecause this is such a rural area it is\nabout the de it's about the serin the\nsubsoil the surface down there at the\nmoment one of our fter sections down\nthrough the forest track here and at the\nmoment lined out one long line one easy\nroute go offline you're going to be\nexpanding a lot of power to get back in\nand that's if you don't have an issue\nnumber of the Riders using this\nopportunity just to take on board food\ntake on board a gel uh take on board\nsome fluid because it is a section where\nit's very difficult to attack so as long\nas you hold the wheel It's relatively\nrestful I'm going to put a big\nrelatively at the front of that restful\nbecause this is still at race Bas it is\nindeed at race Paces ahead down through\nthe mial forest forested since the last\nice age for over 10,000 years this is\nancient Woodland here in Flanders that\nthe UCI gravel world championships for\n2024 is racing through interesting move\nby matv Goda just trying to move up the\nsecond of the slovenians and this push\non coming in now this is where we saw a\nmove made in the women's race yesterday\non this long Field section we've seen\nthis long stretch out happening now and\nbecause of the makeup of this if the\nRiders are not attentive they are going\nto get distanced out the back everybody\nresponding you can see people scrambling\nfor lines to try and pick the fastest\nroute in and through at the moment the\nBelgian Squad opening up the throttle\nthe cenan modc sitting behind fourth\nwheel fle in fifth it looks like Goa\nsitting just behind then it's Swift\nright at the back still we have got our\nDanish R Jonas Lindberg just losing a\nlittle bit of ground now well and being\non the back of the group not being able\nto pick the ideal line and being pushed\nthrough the mud and the water on the\nvery back of the group you really do\nneed a clear run through that section\nand that will be in every Racer's mind\nwhen they come through this section on\nthe next lap and it's always compounded\nisn't it it's it's not taking the ideal\nline not being able to take the fastest\nline not being able to be the most econ\niCal in terms of the power and the\nstrength you're using to hold position\nto hold the bike online you can't get\nthe power down as much it just all comp\nand of course the risk increases as well\nof having an imp having a mechanical we\nsaw people with bars bent to one side\nyesterday in the women's Elite race\nwe've seen people with punctures in that\nwe've seen people with punctures it\nlooks like another issue here when the\nBelgian foot out there is that a chain\noff is's just having to drift back I\nsuspect going to get a little bit of a\npush along and just see limberg just\nmoving his way back up onto the wheels\nhere yeah so yonas limborg just coming\nback onto the group after being off the\nback and gapped slightly through the\nfarmyard section but the wider Trails\nallowing the group to spread out and the\ncobbled short cobbled climb section\nthere on at the moment you can see the\ncrowds at the top really driving the\npack on and this is a section this is\none of the steepest sections of the\ncourse of Cobble clins at the is known\nfor things like the Flanders classic we\ngo across of course we have so many of\nthe classics the spring classic road\nraces used in these Cobble clins this is\na super short section and it because it\ncomes after the long single track\nsection this a section where I would\nexpect to see that potentially next time\nin and\naround well interestingly transitioning\nvery very quickly from the cobbles into\nthe two cement Runway type Road and a\npush coming on now really on the right\nhand side so just picking the pace up\nthe speed just lifting on the front just\nbeing driven at the moment as they\nmanage to get that power down you come\noff from those twin tracks on to this T\nsection here and once again it's the\nbelgians who are having to turn the pace\nlet's just take a little bit of a look\nback you could just to see The\nSpectators un able to keep their feet\nfortunately running far enough away if\nyou are going to run beside a bik race\ndo it 10 m off the side so you're not\ngoing to get in the way with the Riders\nif you have an issue now onto the\ntechnical section here this is the climb\nback out we've just had a little bit of\na drop and now we are on this section\nnow there is a one smooth line through\nhere it's been ridden in by all the\nRiders yesterday and in practice but the\nsize of it you can see where those\nstones are accumulating where the deing\ndet tritus from the banks has been\nbrushed down when Spectators going up\nthere they're also knocking down\ndelivery as well and that is\ncontributing to making some really\ndifficult section Take the Lead take B\nat the front pick your line have that\nsmooth line keep efficient keep smooth\nconservation of energy at the moment is\ngoing to be key waiting for an attack\nwhich surely must come as we make our\nway onto our second circuit May well be\ndone in the tight section as we running\ntowards the line we've got some real\ntight section and there is a steep\nlittle time on the way into the line\nthat when we go through this time May\nwell expect to see an attack or two\ngoing on well and constant changes in\nparkour at the moment as we move from\none surface to another to another to\nanother and you can see the push now on\nthe front of the race as we swing into\nyet another change of\nsurface so tight right hand\nturn little bit of a gap starting to\nopen between the front three the belum\nrider in fourth place NS picking up the\npace there clearly an indication that he\nwas quite happy to let that Drift Away\nuh just uh uh holding fire making the\nbig man Matthew vandero do the work on\nthe front trying to take some of the\nsting out of the legs uh we're going to\ntake you look in fact it is not going to\nbe vanol has had to do that catch up\nthere that looks like that's AA who's\ndone the work so apologies AA being set\nup to do the work and Vander just\ndropping back here sitting two th the\nway down that group very dangerous place\nto be on unless you're supremely\nconfident as we go in through the woods\nyou can see the track being rolled out\nby these Riders these small bits of dust\ndirt and Deb just almost forming a\nalmost concrete like section underneath\nthe wheels whereas off to the Sid all\nthose that leaf debris all of the gravel\nreally just making although it's not\ngoing to be a puncture risk in this\nsection it is definitely going to be\nmore resistance well and the Belgium's\non the front of that pack of 16 Riders\ngoing going through the 109 km Market\nkeeping the Pace High trying to stop\nthose groups and breakaways\nhappening so great shots of this Forest\nnow just dropping towards the back of\nthe group here this is L naron looking\ndown at the bike that's the repeated\nlook down is that an issue with the rear\ntire here or with those gears it's more\nlikely to be the rear tire he's just\npicking up the pace here could have been\nthat the gears didn't quite go into G\nsqueezing on he was off the back of that\ngroup a little mistake slightest issue\nyou'll find yourself in trouble at the\nback of the group but able to tuck down\na little bit of a descent down you can\njust see him free wheeling his way and\nhere carrying that momentum through just\ngetting a little bit of a break in his\nPursuit onto those back\nwheels fast section here on the\ndescended down high RIS though if you\nget it wrong the faster you going the\nmore likely going to have of a large\nconsequence if you do go off line you're\ngoing to hit everything harder hit\neverything stronger lots of the Riders\ntaking another chance to take on board\nflate on drinks long long race here\ntoday big\ndistances however the Riders at the\nmoment still continuing to push out a\nfaster Pace the leading Riders still\nsitting just underneath 39 km an hour\naverage speed at this stage of the race\nwith 75 5 km to\ngo Belgian Riders still on the front of\nthe group of 16 Riders at the front of\nthis race\nuh Maurice has been on the front for\nsome time ton s is there Johny Vish is\nthere these Riders from Belgium all out\nthe front of this pack\nsoly making our way through the\nmiddlewood at the moment these Riders\nusing these tracks a very very fast race\nroute\ntoday very fast gravel\nracing less technical but super super\nquick and of course this is the third\niteration of the world championships the\nfirst two based in Venita in Italy\nuh here today in belgi in the Flemish\nbro band a real home ground for the\nmajority of these Riders uh here today\neven Riders like Conor to spend his time\nout and racing on these roads plenty of\ntimes but once we leave here at the end\nof this we are going to be traveling a\nlittle bit further a field for the world\nchampionships the 2025 World\nChampionships moving across into n in\nFrance down on the south coast then\nwe're going to go uh to Nan up in\nAustralia that's going to be really\ninteresting when we head across there\nfor the gravel racing really interested\nto see how that courses and the\ndifferent terrain and how they use that\nunique uh geology and geography that\nthey have uh in Australia uh we come\nfrom there to the hes of why that's when\nwe have all of the cycling displayes\ncoming back together for the super\nworlds uh once again uh that's in 2027\nthen going across to Saudi Arabia to\nalula in\n2028 for the UCI gravel World\nChampionships that will be very\ndifferent again and I'm looking forward\nto seeing what happens great to see it\nmoving\naround really love to see it go to the\nhland and really the the start of uh uh\ngravel racing out into the states I mean\nif can you imagine taking the quality of\nriders we've got now adding to them the\nquality riders that we're regularly\nracing in the states put them on to a\ncourse you know something like Unbound\nor similar where you've got these really\nlegendary courses and these really\nlegendary routs we see really epic races\nsome years where it's so muddy and it's\ngrim and other days when it's fast it's\nbold as stream i' really love to see\nthat just got to have somebody to\norganize it well I'm sure at off I'm\nsure at some point in the future it will\nhappen but at the moment there are\naround 20 km left of the first lap of\nthis route around louen where the finish\nline is based and the pack of 16 races\ncontinuing to motor at the 11 12.4 km\ncheckpoint it is yet again the Belgium\nRider xandro Maurice on the front 2\nhours 54 minutes 35\nseconds so this leading group reasonably\nstatic just taking a little bit of a\nlook behind at the time checks at where\nthe rest of the chasing Riders are at\nthe moment and which nations are\nrepresented a little bit further back uh\nwhen we go off the leading group P vok\nof czechia currently sitting in 25th\nplace looks like the\nGerman Along with Dan Belgian wel and\ndanot along with go for sitting 27th to\n29th Johnny hland always a very popular\nRider 30th he's got Cameron Mason for\ncompany uh Tom Martin from great grand\n34th position Matt Holmes 38th at the\nmoment Kobe freeburn from the United\nStates of America just talking about the\nUnited States of America Kobe frean\ncurrently sitting in 39th position he's\njust ahead of a certain Greg van aramar\na man who does know how to briide B to\nput it mildly that's not bad company to\nbe in at all Lawrence fet cently 43d\nposition just dropping back Felipe orts\n46 the r of R Spain Two Italians\ntogether Demari and gavia uh sitting in\n48th Chad Haus currently in 49th\nposition uh we just taking a little bit\nof a rundown uh we have got at the\nmoment sitting just inside the 3H hour\nmarker that pretty much most of the top\n100 right so uh although the Gap is big\nfrom this group\nback it's uh it's certainly the racing\nis on all the way through the field well\nlet's just talk about the Gap at the\nmoment the Gap back to the chasing two\nRiders of ber and rasman at 3 minutes\nnow but the story really is about what\nis going on behind them because the Gap\nbehind them now is down to around 40\nseconds so it's looking like the seven\nRider group 40 seconds down on beron and\nrasman may well shortly be on their\nheels uh bringing the chase group from\ntwo to nine but at 3 minutes even if you\nswell your ranks like that it's still\nstill a long time Gap game over it's got\nto be game it's just not going to happen\nand if there were to be an issue with\nthe front group and we talk about it's\ngoing have to be a major issue or\nsomething to to come back the race\ncommissaires the r race referees\nbasically uh are going to stop the\ngroups and they're going to restart the\nrace with time gaps in there because if\nthere was something it's a classic if\nthere's a railway Crossing uh and you\nget stopped if there's an incident if\nthere was an accident on a bridge or\nsomething or a car got stuck or a lot\nthere's no way through then the time\ngaps will be taken and then that would\nbe a restart there that's where we're\ngoing to see The Common Sense go into\nplay so realistically this leading group\nbeing cheered on by these fantastic\nSpectators out around the course leading\nthis race out\n67.7k to go quick reminder the loop that\nwe're on is a 47.7 km Loop this is the\nlast Loop we'll be going into next time\naround at the moment though we are out\non our penultimate loop around the\nforest south of Len down into the m\ndevor and at the moment in these Forest\ntracks our leading group leading out a\ngap of over 3 minutes back nine Riders\nchasing over 3 minutes distance and uh\nat the moment this is about staying in\nthe group not expending too much energy\nchoosing your moment to go clear how\nlong do you think if you were to attack\nMatthew v b uh where would you go well\nthat is a seriously good question\nbecause the pace on this group through\nthe sections that are fast being\nabsolutely drilled by the Belgium team\nat the moment really trying to shut down\nany opportunities for an attack but you\ncan see this track and this Trail now\nthrough the woods is the muddy section\nwe were talking about earlier and again\nline Choice really important being on\nthe back of the group really difficult\nand a little bit further down the trail\ndown here as we go in through the woods\nwe've got a couple of sections where\nthere's about 10 m wide boggy section\nwhere you go in our motorbikes actually\ngot stuck in there on their rarey they\nwere testing it to see how deep it was\nthe answer was it went right up to the\nfoot peges at the side and the foot pegs\nwere underneath the mud the rider trying\nto find a route around it to keep the\nspeed and the pace and this is where it\npays to do your homework to get that\nrace wrecky to get the routs riding in\nto know where the bogy sections are and\nit's not just to know where you to go\nwhere the line is it's how much energy\nto put in at what time on what section\nof track anybody who's ridden Offroad\nwill know you get the line right and you\nput the energy at the right time you can\nmake meters of distance over your riding\ncompanions you can indeed but anybody\nwho's raced cyclecross would also know\nthat when you ride a lapped course the\nconditions can change between laps and\nuh well one more lap of this Loop that\nthe Riders are on at the moment around\nlven to go as they head now back towards\nthe\ncity lead gr coming through great shots\nfrom our camera bike behind the rider\nstill one long line it's only going to\ntake one mistake partway through this\ngroup to open up a massive Gap one a\nlittle pause as we hit another of these\nreally boggy sections here you can see\nthe water standing in the puddles here\nand now as we go down the r is taking to\neither side of the course here where\nit's roll flat where there is a smooth\nline absolutely shaking this bike apart\nhere and the leaders just scattering\nacross the road and this is also about\nkeeping your bike together we saw\nyesterday in the women's race boss have\nan issue with a cycle computer because\nof the terrain being so rough indeed and\nuh that would leave you right in blind\nalthough I think at the moment the ride\nis totally focused on where they're\nheading now out from this left hand turn\nonto our next track Trail down the side\nof the Farmland the real dotted Farmland\nalong with Woodlands uh very much a\nEuropean terrain here very typical of\nthe riding in the north of northwest of\nEurope and at the moment the dust being\nkicked up by the bikes being kicked up\nby the motorbike here this is definitely\na reminiscent of that par Ru Bay dust\ncloud that we see and the Riders at the\nend of this are going to be absolutely\ncovered in mud and dirt it was great to\nsee all the pictures coming in on social\nmedia and across the Press of the Riders\nwho had finished yesterday not just in\nour Elite races but in the age groups\none of the great things about the World\nChampionships masses of riders racing in\nall age categories and that that for me\nreally is part of the the thing that\nmakes gravel so special yes so 15\ndifferent race categories at this world\nchampionship event over the weekend\nincluding the two Elite categories so\nfour age group categories out day as\nalongside well behind the elite Men\nYesterday well it was a phenomenal\nnumber on of riders out on the course 2\nand a half th000 Riders this weekend\nhuge numbers lots of participation\nRiders qualifying into the world\nchampionships in the ages by riding the\nWorld Series and uh that for me really\nreally is a great way let's get the r\ndis qualifying it shows the standard of\nriding well and if you want to qualify\nfor the 2025 World Championships in nce\nuh you need to head over to the UCI\ngravel world series.com website because\nyou can find all the information there\nand all the qualifying races you need to\nbe in the top 25% of athletes in your\nage group to qualify for the World\nChampionships in nce next year so top\n25% going to be qualifying heading down\nto n some great weather down there lots\nof sunshine going to be hopefully\nbathing the Riders after what I'm\npersonally hoping is torrential rain in\nthe week before making exceedingly\ndifficult and putting those skills in\nriding off a road to the four uh\nhopefully taking in some altitude gain\nas well because there's some big Hills\nout and around n some great desent there\nsome great riding whether you're on a\nmountain bike on a gravel bike or on a\nroad bike it doesn't make any difference\nso uh I think hopefully we're going to\nsee a lot of that in play when we go on\nto the next World Championships at the\nmoment we're in the north of Europe we\nare up in Belgium just south of louid at\nthe moment our Riders on this long\nstraight section of the little pinch\nPoint as we come down alongside the\nhorse enclosure here with the minage in\nthe background you can see these Riders\nmaking the way in and through it is a\nstrong equestrian area as well the\nhelicopter staying up nice and high they\njust making sure they don't disturb\neverybody out down in the farmers R\ncoming through at w spe probably going\nto make enough noise with the rattling\nof bikes as they come into our next\nsection and it's a really muddy\ntechnical section through the woods\nagain with very little uh line choice\nand the Riders at the front really\nmaking the most and this is that really\nmuddy corner it is now the tight inside\nline being directed off the other\ndirection the Riders just taking the\nlong sweeping left hand turn that tight\nright hand line is very very tempting is\nvery very deep the bik's just rolling\nthat flat and the riders today having\nthe advantage of all of the Riders\nyesterday all of the age group she's in\nthe same route and then will have rolled\nthat flat so if you've ridden on this\ntype of terrain you'll know that on a\nvery regularly ridden part of the\nterrain you will find it rolls the\nmoisture out it makes it flat and it\nmakes it super fast well it does indeed\nand you can see those beautiful sunken\nroadways pathways through the woods at\nthe moment where the Riders were as we\nhit the chapel of steenbergen uh deep in\nthe Woodlands beautiful beautiful\nsetting here in Flanders an absolutely\nfantastic\narchitectural gem set in The Woodlands\nreal fairy tale stuff seeing the uh\nChapel just nestled here as the Riders\nmake the way in and around you can see\nthe course running just down at the side\nof the chapel here the Riders though\nwell the pressure on and again and this\nis going to be lawence n at the back of\nthe group just drifting off the back\nbehind him well the motorbike is\ntracking him the Gap has opened up in\nfront well the makeup of this group\nreally interesting as we take a look at\nthe 119 km Mark 1 2 three Belgium's on\nthe front at that point two Riders from\nthe Netherlands sandwiched because\nthere's another four Belgian Riders\nbehind Connor Swift from Great Britain\nin the mix Jonas Lindberg from Denmark\nin the mix two Riders from Slovenia but\nthe rest of the group is just blue\njerseys it is indeed as we start to go\nalongside the zat uh and the Minon our\ncamera focusing down on the\ngiant mushroom in the middle toad stool\nto to is get your funy correct Matt as\nthe Riders come around the turn they're\nnot going to be looking they're going to\nbe taking bottles few Fuel and food on\nboard now the feed takes those away you\ncan take assistance just looking at\nnarson here taking on board a drake\ndoesn't look like he's going to stop but\nfor any mechanical assistance here so\nmay well be he's just having a bit of a\nrough time at the back of the pack not\nsure it's where any of our Riders would\nchoose to be well note also Riders\ngetting rid of bottles here as well\nbecause this is also a waste zone so\nwhilst their feed and Tech zones on the\ncourse there are also opportunities for\nRiders to get rid of any waste they're\ncarrying and the Championships here part\nof a big push environmental push to make\nthe event as carbon neutral as\nenvironmentally friendly as possible a\nlot of the transport for Riders being\ndone by bike basically riding from the\nFinish to the race start the organizers\nactually setting out a really great rout\nsuit head across from Len where most of\nthe Riders are based across to Hal the\ngroup coming back together reforming Reb\npunching getting it back together be\nforced straight away back off you don't\nget Tac for long there might be a lot\nset of TAC sections but boy they're not\nlong on to the kicker onto the climb\nlinking the sections through these\nWoodlands together short sections on the\nTAC because they bring you in to these\nbeautiful Woodlands as this 16 man\nBreakaway group leads with 61 km to go\nin the\n2024 UCI gravel World\nChampionships well the woodlands lined\nwith Spectators and It's Tricky here\nbecause you've got the technical\nfeatures of the ground but the groups\nlarge at the moment and The Spectators\nlining the sides of the trails here in\nthe woods part and parcel of the feat\nyou need to mix two of the Belgian\nRiders now on the back of this group and\npanan here as well has I'm just taking a\nlook it's n isn't it and he was on the\nfront doing a lot of work earlier on\nbefore he dropped to the back of the\ngroup but big attack big push on the\nfront here you can see Matthew vander's\nchosen this uphill section this is one\nof the longest sections of Forest track\nhe's gone on the attack and Conor has\ngone onto his wheels here so the rider\nfrom Great Britain answering the attack\nfrom the rider from the Netherlands and\nthat is a big big move on the front it\nhas dispatched pous it's dispatched n\ngone as well that is going to be Gara\nhe's out of the running and the Gap has\nopen the Bel are chasing this is a long\nlong section we run around we got this\nright hand turn we keep on going until\nthere is a very tight 90° left we still\nstay in the wood another 90° left and\nthe TAC does not resume until we are\nmuch further down this race route and\nthat is going to be very very telling\nwhat do the runers behind do who has got\nany kind of speed any answer to this\nattack the place to be is on the wheel a\nflicker the elbow oh wish that was no\nchance Sunshine from Conor Swift there\nyou've got the power you're the big\nfavorite you're the man that everybody\nthought we were going to need to beat\nyou're going to have to do this they're\ngoing to be heading on and through\nheading back in towards the appr to\nlouen at the moment it looks to me like\nthis Gap is really starting to stretch\nwell both of the Riders off the front\nhave taken third place in this world\nchampionship competition vandero in 2022\nConnor Swift in 2023 they have both\nfinished on the podium before but both\nof them picking up bronze medals they\nwant to go better than that this is\nabout goals and going for\ngoals massive effort behind you can see\nthe Chas is trying to come that camera\nfor shortening the distance but the\nscale of the Riders given a clear\nindication that that Gap really has and\nnow Swift starts to work where of\nvandero here well the flick goes for\nvandero to come through but he's sitting\non on the wheel that big effort to go in\nenough to open it up the Riders both on\nthe hoods here this is one of the\nsmoother sections of the trail as they\ncome in through this Woodland they've\ngot to keep the power down and it has\nreduced the group if this group comes\nonto the back will which I suspect they\nwill then we are going to see a reduced\nleading group and it's left to defending\nChampion mate mic of Slovenia to do the\nwork the Belgian been working a big pull\nthere from florid and visha rer number\neight on his back there in the black red\nand yellow of the Belgian colors he\nflicks his other I can't go and look at\nthat another Belgian is going to be out\nof the running here because Giani Vish\nnow kicks off Giani Vish is having to go\naround the side of his brother Flor and\nat the moment Giani is's absolutely\ndying a death out here he's he's really\nstruggling with the pace really\nstruggling with a speed and he cannot\nget onto the wheels easily this is a\nmassive effort by the Riders the speed\nthe pace of the leading to is keeping\nthem clear mic is chasing the Belgian\nSquad are in his wake and at the moment\nall hell has broken loose in the forest\nwell it has indeed and the belgians have\nbeen dialing the front of this race for\nso long keeping the Pace High they've\nhad strength and depth in numbers but\nthen with this attack coming closing it\ndown well some of those Belgium Riders\nwho have been work horses on the front\nnow going out the back of the group so\nthis is going to leave us up much more\nselect group as we come in at the moment\nyou've got floran and Giani Vish in the\nmix you've got mat moric in there as\nwell Matthew vandero you've got Connor\nSwift on the front the Clos down is\nhappening though they're going to get\nonto the back wheel here they're just\nabout all going to make it that's going\nto be critical you need to be on the\nwheels and modic after that turn he's\nnow starting to drift off the back I'm\nnot not sure how much help he is going\nto get here from Flor and\nV well it's looking like this may become\na group of ooh seven Riders eight Riders\nlooking behind their shoulder checking\nto see where the group behind is they've\njust gone through the 124 km marker and\nthe Gap split in this group is around 20\nseconds so the split in this group\nreally doing damage from vandero drives\non on the front he doesn't want to let\nthis whole group go back he may well be\naware that when he looks over his\nshoulder the biggest Gap back is to a\ngreen Slovenian Jersey that's a jersey\nhe's got become very familiar with over\nthe last two weeks right of course in\nZurich at the road World Championships\nlast weekend a big chat here look at\nthis conversation going on a look across\nthere because that was a chatter from\nyesper stens having to see who's got\nanything left in the tank vandero drops\nback with that number two in that orange\nJersey so it's modish vandero verish\nthat's Flor Conor Swift yes St Quinton\nHerman in the mix as well but you've got\nGI Vish in the group Matti monic and\nvandero dropping to the back now not\nsure I'd want to let vandero out my\nsight he put the attack in he put the DI\nin he's now going to do a recovery are\nthe belgians hatching something in in\nthe middle of this group they can't see\nthat vandero just reaching in his pocket\ntake on more food and fuel well whilst\nthe belgians discuss strategy it's\nConnor Swift on the front the group of\n16 now down to\n[Applause]\nseven well look at that Gap go out\nalready it's over 30 seconds now back to\nthe chase group The Group of Seven now\nclear of the rest it was 16 it very\nquickly became seven because Matthew\nvano and Connor Swift put in the Dig\nthey put in the drive they went away\nfive riders only able to come\nback oh the chasing group The remainders\nof that leading group of 16 now coming\nonto the tarmac but it is a big gap\nback that is a massive massive G that is\nnot going to come back any time as soon\nsurely no matter what tactics played out\non the front it is a good siiz group but\nthe Belgian Squad represented up at the\nfront the Slovenian Squad represented\nthe front the Netherland Squad\nrepresented up at the front Great\nBritain represented in that front group\nthis is going to be pretty critical now\nwhat are they going to do about this\nwhere is this going to come to rest are\nwe going to see a group come back I\ncan't imagine for one second that this\ngroup chasing are going to bring back\nour leaders but this is bite racing it's\ngravel racing Anything Can Happen out\nthere it takes one slip or slide one\nmistake bit like side cross all too\noften you can see a leader go down and\nthe group behind get held up and then\nthat allows chases to come back people\nwho were out of the race come back in\nthe disappointment for that leading\ngroup often evident as the Riders go\nunderneath the rail line it is a full\nright hand turn here we're headed almost\ndirectly in towards Lou this is the main\nrail line running in from the southwest\ninto the city this is indeed the final\neight kilometers of the lap when they\nget this point on next lap there will be\n8K to\ngo well the Riders wrecking on race\nroute the run into the Finish because\ntwo laps of this Len lap it's\n47.7 km as the Riders come in towards\ntown the seven riders in the leading\ngroup with a gap back of 33 seconds now\nto an a nine Rider chasing\ngroup so Giani Vish Florian\nVish in the M Quinton Herman Jasper\nstoven all riding for Belgium we've got\nConnor Swift from Great Britain we have\nMatthew vandero from the Netherlands and\nmat Modric riding for Slovenia in the\nleading group a number of these Riders\nhave had issues earlier on they've gone\nthrough bad patches Conor Swift having\nto chase on how much sting has that\ntaken out of last year's bronze medalist\nConnor Swift riding strongly in the\nNational gravel championships of Great\nBritain alongside his brother Ben Swift\nwell he did indeed brother cousin cousin\nhe a cousin I should they're from around\nthe around the corner in Yorkshire well\nSwift qualifying in that Welsh event uh\nfor this championships you two can\nqualify for next year head over to UCI\ngraor series.com where you can find out\nall the information 15 different age\ncategories in two including the two\nElite categories at the World\nChampionships every single one taking\naway a jersey indeed and this is going\nto be really real little crunched off\nnow this run into the finish this is one\nof our narrowest sections here and if\nsomebody goes off the front you're not\ngoing to be able to respond at the back\nthere is no way to go through you can\nhear the trees whipping against the\ncamera by the cameraman just stood up on\nthe back trying to get a shot of these\nRiders Connor Swift on the back I'll\napologize to the entire Swift family\nlater that'll teach me to read anything\nwith misinformation in it as the Riders\ngo up subliminally influencing the words\nat the moment there's no subliminal\ninfluences on these Riders the thing\nthat they're focused on is that Finish\nLine it's getting there in the leading\ngroup or clear of the leading group\nkeeping the pressure on and maybe just\nstarting to shed a few of those Riders\nbehind we're just going to go underneath\nthe main uh Road here this is the E40\nthe Riders just travel under and then\ntake the left hand to so basically this\nis where they joined the circuit last\ntime around now that is great\nsportsmanship you just see our Swiss\nRider pulling to one side to light the\nelite leaders three because of course\nwe're coming round to complete our First\nCircuit some of the rest of the Riders\ngoing out onto their first circuit here\ntoday of this very tight and Technical\ncircuit into town out of town and then\nonto the big and fast tracks through the\nmirror of world down uh in the southern\nsection of the circuit now sweeping\naround to the right here we start track\nback into w l following the Woodland cut\nacross a couple of farm Fields before we\nget into town and then we get on to\nthose really sight sections coming down\npast the Arenberg Castile on the way in\noh we do indeed heading in to Len this\nis the lead of the world championship\ngravel race at the moment here in\nFlanders seven Riders clear the Gap\nholding it just around 30 seconds 38\nseconds at the moment to the ninan\nchasing group was a group of 16 the\nattack from vandero and switching that\nhere is the attack from Van you can\nquickly see Connor Smith go straight\nonto his will and anticipating what the\nrider from the Netherlands was going to\ndo this two Rider Breakaway put in a gap\nbut five Riders from the 16-man group\nmade it back giving us a leading Group\nof Seven I'm really interesting there\nthe response of R Matti modrick he could\nnot close that down instantly he was\npretty much behind he was in the key\nplace to go he saw Conor Swift going he\nlooked at it and he didn't close it he\ncouldn't answer that straight away or\nchose not to and choosing not too surely\nhe not a choice that he's going be\nmaking at that stage not knowing just\nhow far that Breakaway was going to go\nand whether or not it could stay away it\nhave wanted to be in there didn't make\nthe junction over this little Bridge\nhere over the D ditch this D runs\nalongside to the left hand side of the\nRiders a little way on the way in here\nthis run at the moment being led by\nConor Swift to Great Britain immediately\nbehind him H you can see it is Giani\nVish the rider just going up onto the\nfront as Swift pulls over then it's\ngoing to be Quinton hermans who moves on\nto the front of the race followed by\nFlorian verish in that darker helmet of\nthe belgians there just going through he\nholds the front here he's doing a longer\nturn as he holds the front of that group\nyasper stoven the next Rider H to move\nto the front then it's going to be\nMatthew vandero of the Netherlands then\nmatate modc followed by Connor Swit\ntaking turns and now a little bit of a\ndrop off the back here and that looks to\nme like that is going to be Jing for me\njust m distance well also taking on\nboard Walter at the moment and his\nteammate looking over his shoulder\nwondering where he is so Jani Vish the\nrider getting dropped off the back as\nthe pace pushes up but the Belgium\nRiders making sure they are all back on\ngroup interesting telling the signs that\nwe are now seeing in this group and it's\na good question as to whether they are\nsigns of what we are going to see in the\nnext 50 km or whether they are just\nrefueling at this point and getting\nready to finish this\noff well we run back through the arberg\ncastle and you can see the wide Trails\nof the Parkland running alongside the mo\nhere on the run into Len now Len a\nUniversity Town since 142\n5 KU Len is one of the oldest\nuniversities in the world huge number of\nstudents huge number of crowds huge\nnumber of cycling fans in this region of\nthe world as the leading group in this\nmen's Elite gravel World Championship\nrace head back into\ntown so tight turns as we start heading\nin in the tracks and trails that\nnormally see the commuting cyclists\nriding in and out of Len center now home\nto the gravel world championships for\n2024 select Group of Seven Riders on the\nfront Matti modish of Slovenia Conor\nSwift of Great Britain floran Vish Giani\nVish yaser sters Quinton hermans of\nBelgium and a certain Netherlands Rider\nMatthew van pole the man they're\nprobably all watching for an attack on\nthe climb now as we come into town it\nNarrows and then we go down we have a\nlittle bit of a dip and then arise up on\na cobble climb it's narrow at the top of\nthat as well and on the way into it and\nthat is a great point to attack but\nevery single Rider will know it's there\nevery single Rider will be aware that\nwhen we hit that it's a great place to\nput down megawatts to really stump on\nthe pedals to put down that kind of\nexplosive effort that we see races won\nby will we see that happen here\ntoday well the question is this lap or\nnext it's very close to the finish next\nlap it's very very close indeed our\nleaders just jump on to the main road\njust uh making their way in and around\nthis is basically getting around the\ninner Ring Road as to come into the\ncenter of Len itself push on the front\nhere a little bit of a move starting to\nstick starting to go clear they're going\nto go around the Riders to the side of\nthe course here and you can just see the\nrace leaders absolutely flying down here\nthat gap opening up very very quickly\nindeed being close out who responds who\nis the first into action behind it is\nvandero chasing that down the first move\nbeing made by Giani Vish Clos back down\nagain and it's this the pattern that\nwe're going to see established in the\nracing the Belgian Riders firing R after\nthe rider down the road and it's those\nnations with one Rider Slovenia the\nNetherlands and Great Britain who have\nto answer those multiple attacks well\ndanger moment surely they've left\nvandero on the front we're now into town\nwe're going to go uphill it's going to\nstart climbing is he going to go for\nthis this is the tight right hand to and\nsuper narrow each and every one of these\nturns around the side of the church and\non to the cobbles we go the power's\nbeing put down there is a move being\nmade here are we going to see St open up\nthe gap on the front this is now\nstarting to do damage quick response\ncoming from Mish behind looks like he's\ntrying to close the gap he's trying to\nkeep this under control and he has\ndone attack nullified well it was indeed\nand now the run in towards the center of\nL they've got one more gravel section of\n500 M before they hit the t ma the final\n100 1,000 kilom kilom 1,000 M I need to\nput my teeth back in the final 1,000\nMERS of this lap on the tarmac it is the\nrun into the finish and this leading\nGroup of Seven Riders it's uh grinton\nHerman's on the back of the group and\nhe's been sat on the back of the group\nnow for some time Quinton Herm is a\nregular cross Rider a few years ago\nstill re across regularly as the Riders\nmake the way into town this fantastic\nsetting for the\n2025 gravel World Championships the\nriders coming down that long straight to\nthe top right hand side of your screen\nturning left and right around the\nCentral Square here today now the lers L\nand however it's not the end of any\ndifficulties going around these twist SS\nwe've still got lots of technicality\neven within the center of Len itself so\nleaders making the way down past a lot\nof the Expo and a lot of the trade\nstance here today zigzagging the way in\nand through great to see all the VIP\nbeing emptied and all the runers uh\nbeing watched by everybody leaving the\nchampagne behind and heading down to the\nbarriers champagne Len is the beer\ncapital of Europe it has the longest bar\nin Europe as well at the oud Mark uh you\nknow these Spectators even the VIP\nfueled by beer not champagne well we\nwill see other drinks are available now\nround the final turn here this turn of\n500 M to go uh going to be really\ninteresting to see who's leading through\nnext time you can see the Riders\ndropping down this long straight away\neverybody just rolling through at the\nmoment\nthe pace is hot enough to keep these\nRiders clear it's not full on attack it\nis nullifying the attack somewhat and\nthat is one of the things that the\nRiders who don't want this to get broken\njust yet are going to have to do they're\ngoing to have to try and stop people\ngoing close the pace drops you're going\nto see an attack because that is the\nmoment when you can get that Gap when\nthe rest of the raders are going slowly\nso over the line we go out onto the\ncircuit this is going to be the last\nround the last lap around the circuit\nhere today 47 kilm plus of very tough\nriding our rers now into one of the best\nfeatures so far on the gravel course\nwell is indeed this is the railway\nstation bicycle spiral in the center of\nlouen it's got a 4% incline it's 145 M\nlong and today while the riders only\ngoing up it normally four commuters here\nin Len they can use it both ways the\nstairs in the middle yeah no one taking\nthe stairs nobody doing uh a uh uh a f n\nand riding up the stairs uh at the\nmoment even though we are in the heart\nof b as the Riders continue to make the\nway down now you can see them catching\nthe age group Riders here our rer with\nthat green number PL in the 40- 44 age\ncategory uh on the way down on the side\nthey getting a grand stand view of the\nchase group coming down the straet\nthey're a full lap in front well they\nare indeed and it's going to be\ninteresting to see the time split but I\nthink the time split going out now with\nthe leading Group of Seven already\nhaving come through this\n135.7 km marker in 2 hours 39 2 hours 29\nminutes and 9 seconds the chase group\nare well talking with yourselves while\nthe timey screen updates I'm just going\nto turn the handle on the timing screen\nwhilst it updates but as soon as I've\ngot it I'll let you know so just taking\non board the feed the feed Zone just on\nthe exit on the way out as you come out\nfrom the leing in the station at Len\njust on a long straight section of rad\ntakes you alongside the Rail lines out\nto one side lots of the spectat is\ncramming the S here as the Riders try to\ncram the food the gel down gels bottles\nall being passed up to the Riders one of\nthe key feed sections heading out with\n45.7k to go\nthe Gap Now 1 minute 10 seconds to the\nchasing Group Well M being thrown over\nto the side of there by Corner Swift you\ncan just see the script as it came down\nthe straight here and take a look at\nthose faces a lot of concentration a lot\nof riders though looking pretty comfy at\nthis stage nobody really looking to be\non the rivet as they came in through\nwith the one lap to go they know that\nall in with a Chance the chasing group\nbehind they were originally with our\nleaders being a distance you can see a\nlittle bit more suffering on the faces\nof those Chasers coming through still a\nhuge contingent of Belgium riders in\nthere they're going to be kicking\nthemselves if they don't get a win today\nwell the Belgium Riders doing a\nphenomenal amount of work early on in\nthis race and really driving the pace\nwhen the groups were together the\nleading Group of Seven the chase group\nof nine were 16 riders for such a long\ntime and for most of that time it was\nthe Belgium team on the front driving\npace well the lead Group of Seven now\nwith less than 45 km to go in this\ngravel world championships as they head\nback out on this Loop of lven they know\nexactly what is coming they've ridden\nthis lap once before each and every one\nof those Riders will know where their\nstrong points are will know where they\nneed to watch and where the attacks are\nlikely to come in some ways I really\nlove the fact that we have a finishing\ncircuit that we have this loop around\nbecause by having this Loop the Riders\nknow what's say they know what's coming\nit does make it saf for the Riders\nbecause they've got knowledge of what's\nin front of them but it also\nin some ways makes it more difficult for\nthe Riders to attack some in there's a\npart of me that says by having a\nfinishing loop it's great for spectators\nit's great for the safety it's great for\nthe organization it's great for TV but\nit does stop the Riders from being quite\nas engaged and even on this long fast\nsection the rider at the back will know\nhow much room they can give to the rider\nin front and still be able to roll back\non because they've been on here before\nthey know how it's rolling they know how\nit's moving little bit of a hand up here\nthat is coming at the moment from the\nchasing group at the moment it's Tim\nmerer on the back of the group at the\nmoment just having a\nconversation I just looking to see\nwhether there's an issue for M certainly\nholding the face no problems at all may\nwell have been asking for the time Gap\nto the group in front because at some\npoint you would expect that to to be an\nattack from the chasing group they're\nable to roll on here I see reminiscent\nof going out on the club and at the back\nthey're at the back there they're saying\nwell how you going to have a go am I\ngoing to have a go how's feeling good\nhow's he going you know they're not\ngoing to be talking DIY they're talking\ntactics there they're looking to see if\nthey can put an attack in to go up and\nBri either to try and Bridge which is\nunlikely but at least improve the\npositions and put more riders in front\nof that chasing Group Well the chasing\nthe leading Group of Seven the chase\ngroup of nine Now 1 minute 10 seconds\nthe Gap the Gap back to group three on\nthe road well I can tell you uh that\nthey'd gone through the 129 km marker uh\nseconds before the chase group of nine\nwent through the\n135 km Mark it's over 4 km difference on\nthe road between Chase group two and\nChase group three the yes for St with a\nlittle bit of a word a little bit of the\nhand on the shoulder there of Giani\nvisha visha just rolling to the back of\nthe group moving back is Flor and V with\nthat darker helmet you're going to see\nConor Swift rolling back Matty mod and\nthat means jper St started to move up\ntowards be front here are we going to\nsee an attack from St who was looking\nvery very relaxed and he got on the bite\nand then that Focus kicked in he got on\nto the turbo and warned himself up a\nreally looking like he was in the zone\nwill he be able to make this Camp can he\nattack are we going to see Team tactics\nof play we have of course in here mat\nModric we've got floran verish we've got\nConnor Swift all three medalists from\nlast year we've got Johnny Vish the\nwinner in 2022 Matthew vano bronz and\nmedal in 2022 only Daniel OSS in fact of\nthe medalists so far in the UCI World\nChampionship shs not in this leading\ngroup well it is indeed a select group\nof seven leading this gravel World\nChampionships today in Flanders and\nagain yet again just a drop on the back\nof the chase group yeah that's NASA just\ndropping off the backat we've seen him\ndo that time and time again maybe just\nto want in a little bit more room some\nRiders just like that little bit extra\nspace a little bit extra distance\nbetween them and the wheel in front\nparticular particularly when they're\nsitting at the back of the group not the\nfront now at the moment this pace being\nset by Matthew V this a really narrow\nsection there's no way anyone's going to\ngo around the outside he can really back\noff and not worry about an attack now\nthe age group is having to move off to\none side as the leaders go through\nthat's one of our 35 to 39 age group is\njust having to uh move away out of the\nway of the lead motorbike and the camera\nbikes here that are tracking our Riders\nthrough the forest lots of riders out on\ncircuit lots of people spectating a\ngreat environment a great atmosphere all\nthe way around the circuit as the\nmotorbike makes his way up and through\nand the lead is going to be coming out\naround another of the AG group Riders\nhere on a very technical part of the\ncircuit well it is indeed and moving off\nof the racing line to allow the leading\nGroup of Seven in this men's Elite race\ntwo go through and this track and this\nTrail through the woodlands with a lip\nand an edge to that path once you go off\nthat if any of the leaders drop off the\nside then they are going to be in\ntrouble they're not going to be able to\nget themselves back on easily it's\ncertainly possible without incident but\nthey will want to avoid that all cost\nbecause it is going to be something\nslight that may well trigger the attack\nand the move off the front and a high\npercentage of this course open to the\npublic well the push is on but vanle\ncomes off the front of the pack and\nmoves to the side uh and as they come\nout of the Woodland and onto the\nParkland the pace picking up and it is\nindeed pushing on here the Gap now at\n17 so just see Flor M open up the\nthrottle a little bit mat Modric comes\nthrough rolls very quickly off to the\nleft hand side moves off the front Swift\nwill be the next of those Riders to do\nso the lead is heading into the forest\nin the distance here they move past the\nbarracks here as they start to to head\nalong this big wide Road into the\nWoodland into the forested station that\nwill take them right the way out and\nround the bikes tracking as vandero now\ncomes through on the front taking turns\ntaking a little bit of a rest at the\nback before coming in and\nthrough so vaner Paul rolling off this\ngrp working together just little stretch\nof the back and a look back there by\nvandero now vander's back is potentially\nhis weak point is ailles heel when it\ncomes to racing Offroad it's not all\nthat long ago where he potentially\nwasn't going to race cycl cross ever\nagain this is a man who's been grownup\nembedded in cycl Cross I mean the grumpy\nAndre vandero the Huga hide Cy cross\nwhere we've had World Championships and\nWorld Cups for as long as I can remember\nuh is named after as an attack goes on\nthe right hand side well vander's back\nable to hold the pace here as the kick\ngoes from V Vish goes down the right\nhand side of the road quickly onto his\nheels goes vandero and let's see if\nthere is a response behind all the\nbelgians content to L Flor and verish go\ndown the road they are being left to\nConor Swift here and vandero well after\nstretching his back out quickly back on\nto the wheels well swis just asked some\nhelp from the group but he's not going\nto get it well mic has attacked on the\nleft hand side of the road he's the\nrider coming from the back of the group\nhe wants on this Breakaway he doesn't\nwant to take the others with him so\nSwift asking for help now at the back of\nthe group Maric at the front because the\nBelgium are in between so mon the front\nof this chasing group and this has a\nvery familiar look to it rers chasing\nonto two Breakaway leaders coming down\nthis track with the sunshine going down\nmodri comes off and not one of the belg\ngoing to the front here an absolute\nrefusal there by Giani Vish to take up\nthe pace neither will yesper stens\nneither will quinson hermans the two\nRiders the two nonbing Riders are going\nto have to work together but this is\nrisky which you bet floran Vish against\nMatthew vandero in a 40K run to the\nfinish that is surely a very risky\ntactics surely they will want to try and\nget away belgians away solo and leave\nbehind\nvandero mat modic attacking there when\nConor Swift asked for help not good news\nwell and Swift looking behind him to see\nwhether moric is going to go with him\nbut he's not a little Shake of the head\nbecause it's a Belgium on his wheel now\nmoric comes up to the side but he's not\ngoing this is not going to help Connor\nSwift on the front so Connor Swift puts\nin a dig It's Quickly closed down he\ntakes a look across nothing happening\nnothing doing they're going to leave it\nto the moric and Swift do not need to\nattack each other they do not need to\nwork against each other they need to\nwork together form a temporary Alliance\nyou can just see the moment the the pair\nof non- belgians come off the front the\nbelgians put the pace down on the right\nhand side see if they can drop them off\nthe backat that would be an ideal\nscenario for them to leave them alone\nwith Vander B at the front in which case\nexpect to see them to try and Bridge the\nleaders though at the moment Matthew\nvandero fling Vish leading this race out\nattacking the move by Vish answered by\nvandero the chasy in the group have got\na big gap now opening between them and\nthe leaders six second does not do that\nJustice well it doesn't indeed and for\nmeish looking behind to see where the\nchase group are they're at 6 seconds at\nthe moment and it is literally top and\ntailing with the belgians in the middle\nhere so either moric or Swift on the\nfront either moric or Swift on the back\nuh these two Riders the only Riders\nworking in the group and take a look at\nthat one of them comes off they just go\nright across the track and it's another\nmove now made by Yas stens stens has\ngone for this interestingly response\nfrom Giani Vish they're going to see who\ngoes with them they may be sensing that\nmatate Modric has not got an answer to\nthe moves Connor Swift able to respond\nto this and look at Matty Modric he's\nnot pulled this back instantly he's\nhaving to keep on working he's being\nmarked out by Quinton hermit what a move\nthey put in the attack they wanted to\nsee have what Modric has got in the tank\nand I think he's into his reserves well\nI think they got their answer because it\nis a clo a slower closing of the gap but\nthat doesn't mean he can't stay the\ndistance this is just going to be about\nwho attacks and whether he can respond\nand we've got to remember Riders go\nthrough good patches and bad patches\nwhere they're feeling good where they're\nfeeling bad as well as the terrain as\nwell as the attacks and the moves up by\nthe opposition meanwhile on the front\nthese two Riders just focusing on going\nclear and staying clear vandero with\nFloren Vish in the mix here though you\nhave got to expect Al strong Riders In\nthe Mix Flor with a silver medal last\nyear Vanda with a bronze the year before\nboth of those in venito on the roads of\nItaly here in Belgium in Len on our\nfinishing circuit with 37k to go the Gap\nis continuing to go out the three\nBelgium Riders here not contributing to\nthe chase waiting for a rider to come\noff the front and then attack it now\nthen a cheeky elbow I think that's\nprobably the cheekiest I've seen for a\nlong long time coming from Giani Vish oh\nby the way we won't help you but go on\ngive us a hand in the chase I don't\nthink so well it's your turn that's what\nhe's saying because he's not up for\ntaking his well Matthew Vander and\nfloring for Mish two Riders at the front\nsharing the work at the moment 13\nseconds now the gap on the\nroad I'm not sure if I was slowing V me\nshall be doing much more work and I\nthink 37k might be just about enough to\nget some kind of energy back if you\nleave Matthew vandero on the front the\nentire way to the finish and you sit at\nthe back and take as much rest as\nphysically possible as much shelter on\nthe way through to have some kind of\nanswer floran Vish though don't discount\nhe is a very very strong Rider he the\nsort of Rider who could well be in the\nrunning here uh when it comes to the\nSprint because we got to remember that\nthis is not a standard it's not a road\nrace it's not a cycle across the race\nthis is gravel racing and it's that\ncombination of tracks Trails endurance\nspeed bike handling that all contributes\nto the fatigue it's just different\nterritory well it is indeed in a 15sec\ngap at the moment is probably not enough\nfor Vish to not do the work at the S I\nknow there's strength and depth in the\nBelgium numbers because there are three\nbelgians in the chase group of five\nbehind but it's still if the groups came\nback together would leave three non\nBelgian Riders In a Group of Seven\nit's\nrisky it is it is it's I'm not sure see\nthat if you could pull that group back I\nmean the belg in an ideal scenario they\nwant to drop Matthew M they want to drop\nConor swi get those two out of the way\nget back up to that leading group not\nlet that group go too far but 20 seconds\nhas now been pulled out on the front\nbecause of the non-cooperation of this\ngroup it's so fractious you can feel the\natmosphere between them you can and it's\nthe the Belgian Squad are doing exactly\nwhat they should be doing they're\nsitting on they're not contrib in they\ngoing to the front every now and then\nand then just easing off the pace a\nquick sh there from floring wanted to\nknow the time get camera B right\nalongside our two leaders here amazing\nwork done by these motorbike pilots and\ncameramen out and around the forest here\ntoday bringing you these images from out\non circuit well it's now one and a half\nminutes back to what was Chase group two\nChase group two now because of a split\nin the leading group here the Gap well\nthe Gap that vaner and Vish are\nestablishing over this Chase group of\nfive going out now to 21 seconds but\ninterestingly you know the Belgium of\nthree in this group now it is jper\nSteven on the front it is Steven on the\nfront but just how hard is he working\nreally he keeps on putting does he\npushes on and then sits up if you've\nridden in the group you just sit in\nWason as a pace line of chain G are\nyou're doing throw enough you know what\nthe worst thing to have with you is a\nrider who comes through like I don't\nwant to use the word absolute donkey but\nit really is they come through they\ncharge through they Gallop through but\nlike they're not smooth like a racehorse\nthey Gallop through and then they'll go\nno oh and then the ease back off again\nthere's no smoothness to it they're just\njumping about like an absolute they're\ntrying to disrupt the Rhythm and disrupt\nthe rhythm of moari and Swift as we see\na push on and it is Giani Vish from the\nchase group who's gone down the road the\nbelgians with strength and depth in this\nChase group now jumping on the back of\nmic and Swift and letting them do the\nwork to close it down and we're going to\nsee this aren't we because on the run in\nnow in the next 35 km this is two races\nnow at the moment unless they can close\nthe gap down or something happens to the\nleading two we've got two races underway\nand that attack by J Vish of being\nquickly extinguished by mat modri that\ntime around with G Swift up there styons\nfor me is looking like the strongest of\nthe Riders not a lot of work being done\nthough by Quenton hermans he's been\nhovering round the back he's not attack\nthat we've seen on the front of the\ngroup as styons comes to the back of the\ngroup he's going to be surely waiting\nfor a little bit that push here another\nkick by Giani V just yoyo in the pace\naccelerating out of the corner using the\nterrain here to put the rest of the\ngroup Under Pressure it's going to\nfracture when it fractures who will be\nat the front of that chase group who\nwill be at the back it's going to leave\nrers chasing our two leaders floran Vish\nis the rider in front from Belgium Rider\nsecond in Parry Ru in\n2021 a regular Rider on the cobbles a\nrider who we know is strong a rider who\ncan take away victories definitely going\nto be interesting though to see what he\ndoes here today he's a rider who is so\ngood on the the gravel he's up against\nMatthew vandero whose pomari are just so\nso long you can see the riders coming in\nand out of this section seeing what that\nGap is they're able to look across and\nsee what that chase is looking like from\nthe front they are indeed the leading\ngroup can check the distance back to the\nchase the chase group can check the\ndistance to the leading group and it's\nConnor Swift now moving to the front of\nthe chasing group but very swiftly\nmarked by one of the Belgium Riders\nyesterday we saw the dominance of the\nNetherlands in the women's Elite gravel\nrace today it really is about the\nBelgian team it is and I think that's a\nreflection of the nature of the course\nand the type of riding the Riders uh are\nhaving to put down another attack going\non the front we've seen what is Classics\nracing in this area without necessarily\nhaving the burgs that we would normally\nexpect on the classics and this time\nround the Belgium Riders have fired two\nRiders up the road and it is sticking\nand they've Left Behind one Belgium\nRider Plus moic and plus Connor Swift\nand Quinton Herman surely is just going\nto sit on these two has Swift got an\nanswer to moric trying to bridge back\nacross as stens and Vish now chasing\nJohnny Vish y for stens the two Chasers\ntrying to chase down our two leaders\nFlorian Vish and Matthew vandero just\ngoing back back to that point there uh I\nthink realistically because of the type\nof of terrain we've got because of the\nlack of altitude because it isn't\nmountain bike Marathon type territory\nwhich some of the gravel racing really\ndoes enter into uh then you've really AR\ngoing to see fast Riders you're going to\nsee Riders who got a good background\ninside Low cross you know don't discount\nthe the background of riders like uh the\nRiders at the front of the women race\ntrying not to give away any spoilers\nalso the same here and we' seen good\nroad Riders good cross Riders Matti\nmodri just foot out flat out around that\ncorner there left foot out a little bit\nof a bubble from him it shows you the\nspeed he was carrying into that corner\nto try and close this gap down these are\nall great off-road\nRiders but the terrain I think suting\nRiders who've got a background racing in\nthe uh upper levels of Continental\nEuropean sport well it is really\ninteresting and the changing technique\nand Road surface here so you're coming\nin from a rather stable surface onto the\ncorner you can see the mud on either\nside of the trail as they come and swing\naround that left hand corner and then\nthe terrain very very different it's\nconstantly changing and the chasing Trio\nbehind positions three and four on the\nroad that you've got on the top of your\nscreen at the moment being the chase\nbeing led by Conor Swift then mty mod\nthey've got Quinton Herms and this is\nHobson's choice don't chase lose a\nchance of a medal\nChase but if you chase you're going to\nbe bringing Quinton hermans back up now\nmodic is this fatigue we've seen him not\nquite being able to make the chase down\nwhen you're tired that's when you make\nmore technical mistakes those are the\ndays you run just that little bit wide\nyou don't have the strength to brace the\nbike you don't get that positioning just\nright you don't get it the field right\nHerman said no problems at all he didn't\nbother going the wideline just hopped\nover the apex of the turn very very\ncomfortable with his bike handling still\ngot\nplenty in reserve when it comes to the\nskills and the strength whether he's got\nthe speed when it comes to Sprint we\nwill see Swift mic hermans back up with\nGiani Vish with yasper styman styman on\nthe front left of this group V the right\nhand side just dropping\nback well the status quo is returned but\nall of the skirmishes in our chasing\ngroup will be aiding our two Escape e at\nthe front floran Vish and Matthew\nvandero the two race leaders who had\nopened up the gap on the Chasers behind\nand these five Riders are fighting\nrealistically now probably for One Medal\nthe bronze medal that step on the podium\nthe one they would all like to take\nConor smth would like to emulate his\nbronze medal winning ride last year he\nwould like to be in that position are we\ngoing to see him able to do so Johnny\nVish I don't think he's going to be able\nto repeat his win at the very first of\nthe UCI World Championships when grael\nWorld Championships became part of that\nUCI uh Pantheon of disciplines well\ninterestingly the attack from the chase\ngroup behind had pulled the Gap closer\nbut now they are all back together again\nand taking a look at each other it is\ngoing out again so it had gone down to\naround 20 seconds now out to 28 hitting\ntowards 30 and that's because of the\nlack of drive from the chase group now\nbehind yep that it's not a Chase it's an\nattack each other it's looking at their\nown positions that's leaving both these\nRiders clear to concentrate on the track\non the trail on the terrain to look at\nwhere they're going to make their attack\nto think about what their race is going\nto be from here into the Finish 30k to\ngo the Gap around 30 seconds half a\nminute these two Riders are going to be\ngetting time checks out on the of course\nthey're going to be to be able to find\nout exactly what that Gap is they will\nknow that they've gone clear Vander\nknows though that Flor and Vish has got\ncompany behind in terms of countrymen so\nif they were to come back that's only\ngoing to benefit floring Vish not\nMatthew vandero now as some of our age\ngroup Riders make the way in through\nwe're looking for the race lead and the\nChas is behind that helicopter taking a\nlook down the road and the riders coming\ninto sight the chases here of five\nmaking the way down just slightly\ndifferent lines being\ntaken so Conor Swift taking up the\nrunning as we come in to the same\nsection diving back down H into the\nWoodland once again Matthew modri\nsitting on his wheel they've got the two\nprime spots in terms of seeing the\nterrain and being able to hold the wheel\nthey're going to be relatively safe from\nincidents not going to be taken out as\nlike well not as likely to be taken out\nby another Rider when you're up on the\nfront however just so much work to do\njust to get that third medal is still an\namazing achievement but they would have\nloved to be up with these two leaders\nthe pace that is being set by these two\nthey are just unrelenting we're not\nseeing much relaxation we're not seeing\nthat the two just taking a breather\ntaking a break vano just reaches into\nthe pockets there I think\njust popping the I think it was a gel\nwrapper back into the pocket a quick a\nquick J then back in he's up onto the\npedal and when you see Matthew vul just\nstarting his body usually it's super\nsmooth it starts to rock he starts to\nmove backwards and forwards a little bit\nthat's when he started to pull on those\npedals oh these paths and trails down\nthe edge of the Woodland uh one specific\nline and you can see them coming through\nthe mud and all trying to get well both\nof them trying to get to that core line\nthat turn around that left hand turn\nthere that is the key moment we saw\nvandero smoothly round the inside Vish\nran wide the Gap opened up that was\npotentially the moment Vander drives on\nbut F and Vish is able to answer he's\ncoming onto the back wheel at the moment\nhe's having to carry a lot of speed into\nthis section he's closer down vandero\nhe's on the left hand line he hops back\nup on to the wheel though and he has\nbrought him back that could have been\ndecisive one little line Choice one\nlittle difference between the two Riders\non the entry into that corner Vander\nPaul had it nailed he went on the inside\nit opened the Gap shter line Bish Not\nonly was on the longer line he then had\nto hop across into that tighter line\nonce he did so he had to chase back on\nthat is energy can't afford to burn well\nand there are a number of those sections\nnow in the next 28 km the final 28 km of\nthis race some of these paths and trails\nvery technical due to the terrain but\nalso the\nconditions well the chasing group now\nstarting to string out we are starting\nto see the gaps open up behind the lead\nhere that looks like that is going to be\nSwift on the front who's just setting\nthe base there the moric at the back of\nthis group Johnny Vish who was attacking\nnot all that long ago this that same\nsection coming out from one Woodland\ngoing in to the other and it looks to me\nlike Jan Vish just being distance now\nit's a front two push now surely this is\na time to move you've got a gap behind\nMatti modic take a look but you're going\ninto a descent they're going to have to\ntake risks you're going to have to push\nyou don't risk it you ain't going to get\nthat biscuit well and the question is\nthose two really need to work together\nso the off the back of the group morar\nand Swift on the front those two now\nneed to drive on to chase these two\nbecause this is the lead of the race 41\nseconds up the road from the chase group\nas they continue on this small climb the\ncrowd's absolutely cheering them on now\nas yet again the ground conditions\nchange two claw lines here both side by\nside on this one concrete pass the grass\nin the middle and now it is vandero\ntaking the lead Vander Paul really\nhugging the left hand edge of that right\nhand track the me very quickly behind\nhim that habit of just sitting on the\nwheels sitting directly and like getting\nthe maximum uh advantage in terms of a\nDynamics but also in following the\nsmooth line if the race leaders on there\nusing that line it is going to be a good\none now over the top of this little rise\nwe' just done this steeper section it\ncontinues up as we climb up between the\nsunken sides of the fields here and it's\nmoric setting the base swi sitting\nsecond whe then it's stens being\nfollowed by hermans then Giani verise\nthey're on the left hand side here\nthere's going to go around another of\nour riders in the AG group who pulls to\none side some great sportsmanship being\nshown by the riders in those age groups\nas Mor says I've done enough somebody\nelse can take a turn now this a\nfantastic side tracking shot here of\nConnor Swift to M Modric on the front\nModric takes a look over his shoulder at\nwhat point where these two need to start\nemploy some tactics modri just let Swift\ngo up the road and call the block for\nthe belgians make the belgians work\nConnor Swift let Modric go up the road a\nlittle bit not chase him put Modric on\nthe front sit second wheel let him go\nthe road then make the belgians work\nwell what he got to lose here the issue\nis Swift and morch have got to work\ntogether and there's no real clear\nevidence of that at the\nmoment not disagreeing not disagreeing\nat the moment the two Rudders that do\nlook to be doing the most cooperating on\nthe circuit that we can see are Matthew\nvandero floran verish vandero using all\nof his cyc cross skills that have taken\nhim to six world championship titles in\ncyclo Cross have taken him to the world\nRoad championships in 2023 in Glasgow\ntaking the wins in races like Milan Sano\nthe am gold on Strada biani those races\nshowing just how competent he is across\na multitude of services a rider who when\nhe goes and races The Mountain Bike\nWorld Cups he's feared by the rest of\nthe Riders he's so St however Florian\nVish has had an answer each and every\ntime so far he was the only Rider to go\nwith vandero he's the only Rider to stay\nwith him he's sitting in his Wheel\ntracks and Vish has got teammates behind\nthat should give him the advantage to\njust sit back and let vandero do the\nwork\noh the Gap has been growing and growing\nsubstantially since the attack from\nSwift and mic has been brought back\ntogether 50 seconds now with 26 kilm to\ngo so Flor ination Matthew vandero the\ntwo Riders leading this race at the\nmoment coming to the brow of the hill in\nThe Woodlands they're going to start on\nto the flat run in as we drop back in\nwith the Chaser group behind\nMatthew modri holding that left hand\nline on the cobal the Riders on the\nright hand side jumping onto the\nconcrete of the farmyard there as they\ncome back in towards the woodlands once\nagain and at the back of the group Janny\nVish just sitting back of this group the\ntwo lead is going through vandero on\nthat little climb out of the sadle show\nyou just how steep it is just using his\nbody weight kicking those pedals around\nand I'm going to take a little bit of a\nlook back here at the face of vandero\njust hitting those bumps look the face\nof verish he's just focused laser likee\nfocus on the back of vandero does not\nwant to give him any ground as they hit\nthe top of this rise so it was Vish who\nstayed in the saddle and vapo who got\nout in that characteristic style of his\nbut he's quickly backed down Crouch low\nover the bars accelerating away yeah and\nthe tracks changing constantly here the\nRiders will have a favored surface and\nthe rough nature of some of the terrain\nreally starts to take its toll coming\ntowards the final stages of the race big\nlook across from floran of Amisha\nMatthew vandero couple of wor exchange\ncouple of gestures as they came in\nthrough the request there from Vander\nBol to come through to do some work the\nlead motorbike just going past another\ngroup of riders they're going to see the\nrace leaders coming through this is\nwhere you get a real indication of just\nhow fast our potential world champions\nare riding well you watch them on the TV\nwhen they go past you like this at the\nWorld Championships you suddenly realize\njust how fast they're moving and you can\nhear the shouts of encouragement coming\nup from the riders that they're coming\nup past uh if remember anybody who's\nqualified for these World Championships\nin their H group they're in the top 25%\nthey are not s this is not a carage\npotato versus a world champion these are\ngreat Riders who are seeing the speed\nand pace of world champions go past\nMatti Modric the defending champion on\nthe movie puts in that dive it's just\ninstantly pulled down if this comes to a\nSprint yeser Sten surely has got an\nanswer to any of these riders in a\nnormal situation not so sure now Mish\nwas looking under his arm within five\nRevolutions of that attack he wanted to\nsee immediately where the reer want have\ngone with him it wasn't really about\ncommitment I'm not sure how much of a\ncommitment F Matti mod he's I've seen\nhim on a downhill but have to say I I\nagreee with your point he was looking\ninstantly he wanted to see what happened\nhe didn't want to expend any more energy\nthan he needed he wasn't going to push\nkeep on pushing if somebody was flew to\nhis will now moric goes on the right\nhand side squeezes on the pedals he's\ntaking another look behind he knows that\nthere's not going to be a push meanwhile\nlook at this yeah but look who what\nhappens Jer V sits back he eases off it\npushes Connor Swift off the backat\nConnor Swift has to dive over the top\nwhich means that he can then be closed\ndown by div this is just absolutely\ntactical rule but one 2 three and four\nthey know all the moves they know the\nanswers they know the counter moose you\nknow any one of these Riders they're\nlike chess you know Grand Masters they\nknow the move the counter move and six\nmoves 20 moves ahead they know what they\nwant to do and that's part of the\nproblem for them they can't put a\nsurprise moving on them well but Swift\nand morch know that they know they've\ngot three world class Belgium riders\nwith them they know they're going to\nplay Team tactics with them they know\nexactly what is going to happen time and\ntime again it is a is a case of holding\nyour\nnerve all knowing where your strengths\nare and if you can attack we will see\nwhat happens as the rers continue in\nthrough the forest to the south of Len\nhere at the\n2024 gravel World Championships are two\nleaders are different the race Matthew\nvandero in the orange of the Netherlands\nright on his wheel floran V of Belgium\nthere are two race leaders over a minute\nclear of the chasing group of riders\nbehind the chasing group contains three\nBelgian Riders yes for stens Giani veran\nQuinton Herman he's got Connor Swift of\nGreat Britain and matth modri the\ndefending champion from\nSlovenia all of those Riders want that\nbronze medal they know that potentially\nthe gold and silver have gone this group\nthat you see on your screens are the\nones with the big decisions to make for\nthe bronze medal the two at the front\nit's probably going to come down I hate\nto say this to the power of the climb or\nthe Sprint on the Finish because I'm not\nsure that we have got enough ter rting\nleft to see it break I don't think any\nof them are going to have their pacing\nwrong it could be a mistake an error it\ncould well be just that final Sprint\nthat is going to see a victory decided\nbetween the front two because at the\nmoment their mission is to just keep on\npushing until that truce is called\noff so the chasing group up over the\nbridge here and between the post making\nthe way in to the turn the yellow flags\na warning of that turn to the right is\nthe left and right chicane here back in\nunderneath the amazing trees this forest\nall part of the tracks and TRS you can\ngo out and ride you can go out loads of\ngreat events here nice gravel events uh\nthe marathon mountain bike events out\nthere as well lots of great rides you\ncan take part in and go visit this area\ni' highly recommend it it may not be\nyour cup of te to race on you may like\nyour graveling the year uh a different\nvariety you might like it more technical\nlonger tougher more climbing but it is\nvery very special riding through these\nAncient Forest being able to see what\nyou can do how do you match up against\nthe iders who are the best in the world\nyou're going to have these times set\ndown there I don't think anybody's going\nto better the speed and pace of these\ntwo on the way through floran Vish\nleading Matthew vandero at the moment\nhe's going to be pretty confident he's\nnot going to get attacked from behind\nthe pace is high but we've got the\nundulations on the run in could well\nchange his fero back out of the saddle\njust happing that Rhythm out no he is\nindeed tapping the Rhythm out on the\nback at the moment as they're on the run\nin towards Len again they're coming up\ntowards the 20 km to go Mark and the\ntime Gap is just getting bigger and\nbigger now whilst these two race for the\ngold medal the group behind it's tactics\ntactics tactics for the\nbronze so we're coming into our finale\nof the world gravel championships of\n2020 for our race leaders in the men's\nElite working the way in through the\nforest here around the mood around the\nhos forest from hle going along the\ncourse into towards Len the final\ncircuit repeated twice in the elite\nmen's race they're now passing a lot of\nour age group Riders who set off behind\nthem but are out on to the loop for\ntheir first time the chasing group with\nthat following motorbike making the way\nthrough this the same section we called\nMatthew vandero and Florian Vish on and\nit is mat Modric who leads them through\njust keeping that Rhythm just keeping\nclear of trouble just taking a little\nbit of a thing back to when we saw the\ntwo runers Matthew vandero when he\nstarts to squeeze to come\nthrough his facial expression changes\nwhen he's slightly more\nuh I don't want to use when he's\nslightly more on the river he's slight\nyou think he has a tail it would be yeah\nyou would call it a tail I think it's\none of those I mean we all know that\nwhen he's racing and it's the winter and\nthe gloves literally come off we always\nknow that's when we're going to see a\nmove from him uh you were saying ear\nhe's got his orange glasses on that's\nalways a good day for him I think when\nyou see him go alongside and he he just\nhe almost like he rolls his bottom lid\nbetween his teeth and just as he starts\nto do the move up through you see it\nmeans he's just getting up onto those\nupper limits and the pace is starting to\ntell we'll see whether that pays off see\nwhether that is the case we're going to\nsee if he puts an attack in at the\nmoment I think there's a little bit of a\ntruce being called here they've tried\nattacking each other nothing has\nhappened they now know that they need to\nkeep on pushing they were going to get\nclosed down the G behind them though is\nsubstantial as our leaders come into\nthis right handon this is that muddier\nsection and this is where they're going\nto have to stay clear of trouble stay\nclear of those age group Riders you can\nsee plenty of other Riders out on the\ncourse and at the moment florish leading\nthe duo on the left hand side of the\ncourse they're actually going past some\nof our Elite Riders at the moment I\nthink that's tibo sabatier of France\nthey've just gone past who set off at\nthe same time they're one full laping\nfrom I can tell you something\ninteresting going on behind at the\nmoment because through the\n159.5mm\nmark that this group are indeed Chase\ngroup two on the road at 124 it was\n145 back to chase group three of five\nRiders on the road the time Gap had come\ndown from 2 minutes 5 kilm before so the\nGap back between Chase group 2 and Chase\ngroup three while still significant at 1\nminute 45 is\nclosing and time is running\nout for them to close that down I'm not\nsure they'll make back that 145 it's\ngoing to be interesting to see how that\nplays out as the mer bik and our two\nleaders keep on Rocket Team B Riders\nhere showing their pace and speed this\ndamper section here it is Muddy there's\nmore moisture there's more heal uh by\nthe Tre Lea fall that comes down there's\nmore in the soil in the subsurface here\nwe've got Big Muddy sections at the\ntransitions as you come in and off these\ntracks and at the moment these two\nRiders keeping that pace high they don't\nwant to be pulled back 127 well it's not\ninsurmountable one mistake one error\nthat puts you on the floor and that will\nbe enough you can see the speed they're\ncarrying them as they go into the center\nof the track they are washing across\nthis track so quickly the motorbike\ntracking behind trying to keep Pace with\nthem as they make the way in through\nthey're going to be coming in towards\nthe end here an absolute Express tray\nbeing driven at the moment by vandero\nthe me sits on his back wheel at the\nmoment the Riders taking a look up the\nease off the penals they know that\nthey're going to come into another of\nour Junctions here another turn vul\nleads out now there is a long fast\nsection as we go on to the fields are we\ngoing to see a move Vish comes down the\noutside there Vall just eased off and\nthis is a fast faster section V quickly\nover the top there and that has put\nVander Paul behind he he's just trying\nto push up the inside here he's got\nnowhere to go I don't think he's going\nto make it he's going to sit off to the\nside\noh they continued to pass lap riders\ncoming up to 18 km to go in this UCI\ngravel world championships for 2024\nthese two Riders the and vandero are\nindeed now one minute 29 seconds clear\nof the chasing group of five\nRiders and the five Riders on your\nscreens now the train of riders being\nled by Connor Swift of Great Britain\nsecond Place Matty modic goes off to the\nleft hand side of this big puddle as\nthey make the way around now a drink for\nferle this is coming out the far side of\nthe forest he knew he had time to do\nthis we take that left hand turn with\nvisha\nleading out of the saddle on to the\nclimb in between the sunken pathway here\ndown at the bottom Vander Paul starting\nto wind this up I don't think he expects\nto go clearer the Mish with that\nacceleration he's just piing the pace\nback up he will want to keep this tough\nkicked up and over the top there no\nproblems at all for me straight onto the\nwheel we're going to drop out into to\nthe fields once again straight on in\nbetween the sunken sides of the fields\nthese roadways in existence for so long\nthe fields established up at the side\nthe ancient tracks steep in history\nsteep in cycle racing and steep in\ngravel well we have got our two leaders\nmaking the way through and up on to the\nplateau section here taking the right\nhand side as they go past another Rider\ngoing to take the right hand turn\ngetting this line right critical no\nmistakes can be made 17K to go vandero\nfrom\nVish and yet again the gradient goes up\nthe constantly changing\nso leader on the front is Matthew Vander\nBol Chaser behind is M continuing to\npushing to hold station here as they go\nup at the climb of that little kicker\nit's about keeping Pace keeping position\nmaking sure you don't lose the ground do\nnot make a mistake you are not going to\nget back one mistake now that's going to\nsee the other take flight one error one\nwant hesitation you're going to see them\ngo you can see that this track really\nbeing rolled down by the volume of\nriders Vander pole on the front are we\ngoing to see him wind it up through here\njust increase the wattage increase the\npower the twists and turns the bike\nfighting to stay with them Riders making\nthe way at the front here in between\nhugging the right hand side here this is\nthat left right turn\nhere well you can see the mud you can\nsee the bike slow down and Van the pole\nand Vish push on around that corner and\nup the trail the tracks constantly\nchanging the conditions constantly\nchanging and the Riders really motoring\non the front Now Yep this leading group\nof two being traed by the motorbike and\nyou could see there that the motorbike\npilot is indeed the cameraman as well\nwith that helmet can following these\nRiders can't put the rider and a plion\nuh camera man because of the terrain\nbecause it is so difficult to get\nthrough that section so utilize in the\ntechnology that brings you this\nfantastic race the gravel world\nchampionships for 2025 15K to go at the\nfront of this race we're getting into a\nWars those last 10 miles where we're\ngoing to see who is going to take away\nthe bronze medal the silver medal the\ngold medal and of course that rainbow\njersey well the battle is on at the\nfront between vation Vander pole those\ntwo Riders battling out for gold and\nsilver five riders in the chase group at\nlast count\nwell it's still 1 minute 30 seconds back\nstill 1 minute 30 seconds back the Gap\nis not changing the five Riders now onto\nthis run down past the equestrian center\nuh continuing to battle each other\nthere's a bronze medal at stake in that\nchase group there is and I think that's\nrealistically all that they can hope for\nnow and has been for some while that's\nwhere their attention needs to turn the\nRiders at the front of this race Lander\nPA and V round this turn cheered on by\nthe crowd as they hit the TAC this\nstraight run through going to give him a\nlittle bit of rest back from the\nvibration from the bmps a five at JC R\njust come out from that long sweeping\nturn taking to the left to avoid the\ndeep mud in the middle little bit of a\ngap opening up to Steven here and Giani\nVish at the back Riders number four and\nfive\nif Swift and modic took a look back now\nthey maybe think this is the time to\nkick on as we come up past the steenberg\nchapel there that's one our Riders are\nat the moment they're just going to head\nin past zwater and the infamous Coastal\non the lake well these two Riders\nthey've no time for f they no time to go\nhunting in the wood they're hunting for\na world championship title this is going\nto be about who can take this 10 Florian\nverish put his name on a rainbow jersey\ncan he take away a world he does not\nhave one yet well that silver medal last\nyear he wants to go one better vandero\ntook the bronze in 2022 he's going to\nwant to see his return on to the top\nstep as well here today these two is\ngoing to be a Royale battle between the\ntwo for that gold medal got 14.2 km to\ngo and the Gap well now that is really\nstable over that 1 minute 30\nMark so flowing Vish now how does he\nunlock the puzzle that is beating\nMatthew fero what tools does he have at\nhis disposal can he open up the door\nthat will let him in to take away the\nwin Vander paole of course the rider\nthat is known to be the favorite before\nwe came into this race he was the rider\nto beat he's Rider on the front he's\ngetting a lot of local support a lot of\nthese Riders at the side here will have\nhad the pleasure of watching him in\naction before for some it will be the\nfirst time it's definitely an experience\nof watching the world's best Riders the\nworld's best racers in action here today\nlaor and Vish goes over the top now we\ngot a little bit of a drag here if you\nremember from last night we've got the\nundulations we' got the AG we've got the\nCobble kicker going up the crowds are\nthrowing in the sights here they've made\nthe way from out and round the course\nand now the Riders have being packed\ninto the size and a move from vaner in\nthe midle of the crowd vandero kicks and\nthe Mish has nothing he has gone he's\nopen up it's opening up meter by meter\nlook at the difference in Pace Van the\nPO has done what vle does he has kicked\nand floran Vish doesn't have an answer\nhe has to content himself with pacing\nhimself into that finish he's now in no\nman's land between the race leader and\nthe pack behind well the message has not\ngot back to the pack behind because\nthey're still all over the road but at\n13.2 km Matthew vandero put an attack\ninto Florian vmes and VES had no\nresponse well the group now looking at\neach other this is Chase group on the\nroad five Riders three from Bel\nhave been controlling the group watch\nthis move from vaner just goes down the\nleft a were packed in by Spectators he\nwasn't worried about that he died down\nthe left he stamped on the\npedals huge gear he's going up there to\njust Sprint like that on the flat never\nmind up this gradient and there was zero\nresponse came from veres he clearly is\non his limit he has ridden a phenomenal\nrace but he had no answer when the move\ncame race leader solo m vandero of the\nNetherlands on the front of the race\nlooking to add another title it'll be\nhis first gravel title if he takes this\nto the Finish to add it to his multiple\ntitles in cycl Cross to add to his Road\ntitle as well he will want those rainbow\nB he knows what it is to be a world\nchampion he has to keep it together and\nremember with 12 km to go puncture crash\nissue blow up anything could happen it\nshouldn't do touching wood this is just\na run about ability and skill but when\nyou are on the limit that is when things\nstart going wrong is he on the limit I'm\nnot sure that's a rider who looks like\nthey're on the limit to me well Matthew\nvandol has found another gear now on\nleft loone for M back down the road this\nis a Chase group they were behind and\nwell they are now on the climb where\nvaner is attacking but there are no\nattacks coming here today from the Bas\ngroup of five it's Conor Swift on the\nfront M morck from Slovenia in two then\nit is the Belgian Riders who have been\ncontrolling this group all the way Sten\nsitting on that back wheel of modc as\nthey went up over that climb it's got to\nbe a matter of time surely before the\nbelgic start attacking Modi start\nattacking Swift and start to try and put\nanother Rider up onto that Podium\nthey'll want to maximize the result from\nthis race that may not be a VI\nbut they will want to take away at least\ntwo of those medals here today they've\ngot to start attacking likewise M and\nSwift had to think how do they shake off\nthe belgians how did they go clear of\nthe team as the race leader comes in\nhere just eases a super smart riding he\nease maybe a little bit early there just\nto make sure that the riders in front of\nhim had got cleanly around the corner\nbefore he closed them down he didn't\nwant to be having to sit on the wheels\nas they came around around that turn now\none of the Riders going to get the short\nshrift from the motorbike who's used the\npace here of Matthew vandero to go past\nit's one of the Netherlands Riders\nshouting support to him at he's going to\njust see vle absolutely fly past the\nmotorbike on his heels second place for\nme round that same left hand turn here\nand head through in between the ancient\nstreets the ancient Woodland he's going\nto get some sunshines too it's not going\nto be much rest but he continues to push\nhere just braiding in sucking in the\noxygen it's going to be another medal\nfor him if he can continue this onward\nit will be his second silver medal in a\nrow and it will be the third Vish medal\nin three years will there be a fourth\nmedal will we see Johny verish at the\nrer who took Victory back in 2022 right\nup in contention well at the moment he's\non the back of the of the group\nso he's got to answer the move you can\nsee sens pushing on on the front yes but\nstens leading this train out then behind\nhim Herman being followed by Modi who's\nglue to the wheel Connor Swift just\nworking to get onto the wheel here of\nthat's at mic the moment they get back\nSten sits up they know that they're all\nback together again they've not shaken\nanybody else off and they don't even\nneed to attack they can just let set one\nof their Riders drift off the front and\nmake the two non belum Riders work to\nclose that down to try and nullify the\nattack I think if I was Matti Modric or\nConor I'd absolutely refuse to be going\non the front here i' be on the back it's\nnot about making friends here in this\nsituation this is about looking for a\nbronze medal it's about being a rider\nwho is not mugged by the three Belgian\nhere and taken out before that finish\none man is clear of all of the politics\nall of the tactics the man on the front\none Mission One Finish Line one goal one\ngold medal one rainbow jersey at the end\ncan he do it well this is the rider who\nmany thought would be doing this from\nthe start here went clear he dragged\nclear r as he took\nclear R after rer but then by the end\nonly Flor and Vish could go with him he\ncouldn't stay with him with that big\nattack down the side when he didn't just\npush on he attack at that moment vand\nyou can see the pace as he makes his way\ndown here the Suburban driveways going\non to the roadway here at the side of\nlven that is fantastic the spot to see\nthe world's best racers in action wow\ngoing wide on the corner there as he\ncontinues to push on and continues to\ndrive he's within sight of Len now 9.4\nkm this is the run in towards town as he\ngets into town there is bat B Sharp\nCobalt climb on the run in there is the\nlast section of gravel and then that\nfinal 1 km run to the Finish Line the\nflowing Vish chasing behind down that\nsame section of radway into this same\nright hand turn where we saw the pace of\nVander Paul take him up on to the bike\nPA at the side of the roadway is V do\nsay no he's not and that's a clear\nindication of speed and pace and intent\nthe m not carrying as much speed not\nrunning as wide on that corner carrying\nless pace through and you can see\namazing respect from so many of these\nriders in the H group just popping up\nonto the side there keeping out of the\nway of the race in the elite race as\nVish chases the Belgian trying to chase\ndown the Netherlands rer in the front\nthe man who is clear Matthew vandero\nrace leader and race winner elect at\nthis stage 88.8k to go\n36 seconds from p one P2 position one on\nthe road position two on the road that\nis fer to am 36 seconds now this is\nwhere things get a little bit trickier\nwhen we get tight in on the run into the\ncity that is where if you do come up\nbehind somebody you could lose a few\nseconds vander's got 36 in hand the Gap\nback behind them to this big chasing\ngroup at the moment well the clock\nshowed 216 yeah indeed 220 at the last\ntime check it's FL in around that part\nand then it is around another 120 back\nto the chase group of five on the road\nso the gaps now really significant as we\nrun into the last 8 kilometers vaner\nPoole in one 39 seconds clear of floran\nVish in too the chase group this Chase\ngroup of five the bronze medal is likely\nto come from this group at 2 minutes\n20 220\n40 and our\nleader shortly game over now for the\ngold and silver first and second\npositions now little bit of a shout to\nuh to how far back I think that was\nthat'll be interesting these Riders want\nto know would have been coming but the\ngroup behind are closing they've gone\nsome three minutes down to around 1\nminute 20 so it's not long ago you T\ngone 2 to 145 so 3 to 2 to 145 now to\n120 that is still coming down they can't\nrelax because they will get caught and\nthis is the issue they're going to have\ntoo much finessing at this stage you're\ngoing to be in trouble and that's the\nissue because this group have been so\nconcerned about each other they've not\nbeen paying attention to behind and it\nwas a three minute Gap they were well\nand truly clear but the Gap to that\ngroup now coming down because they are\ndriving forward this group well the\nchase group we're not watching the group\nat the moment the chase group of five\nplaying around well one Rider definitely\nnot playing around the last 7.4 km of\nthis race it's Matthew vandero he put in\nthe attack on the climb he went clear of\nFlorian for Mish now 56 seconds he is\nclear on a mission for gold on a mission\nfor the world championship title here at\nthe UCI gravel World Championships from\nFlanders\nToday l v show from the uh cycling hob\nbet is again in Belgian chasing it down\nat Matthew vandero or not as the case\nreally is now that Gap is opening 47\nseconds he knows he didn't have an\nanswer on the attack he knows that he's\nnot going to answer that pace Vander\nPoole able to go clear visha sitting in\nsecond place the battle for third and\nfor bronze well would you bet against\nyasper stoven where was he born Len\nwhat's his home te town where is his\nhome crowd Len is this going to be where\nhe comes into the finish and he takes\nthis out he's a real all round Rider\nhe's got to keep Pace he's got to keep\nthe speed moving the Riders on the way\naround this to turn the Chase's Maric\nsitting at the back and this is a\nfamiliar pattern or the belgians in the\nmiddle and then it's Connor Swift on the\nfront here just into this little gravel\nsection on this climb at the moment a\nlook look over his shoulder by Swift he\nknows that pace is coming off he knows\nthat they won't relax too much nobody in\nthis group will want to lose out on a\nthird place that's something that you\nwon't want to have on your palaris that\nyou are in a potentially bronze medal\nwinning position and you let a Chase\ngroup come back up conversation though\nbetween stens here and vus they come\nover Johnny visha moves on to the front\nquickly moves to the left hand side then\nit's going to be modc followed by Swift\nand you can see right at the moment well\nit looks to me like Quinton Herman's not\ntaking up position here so our stens and\nHerms being kept in reserve for the\nsections a little bit later on of the\ntwo St the bigger Riders\ngenerally regarded as the better but\nQuinton hermans is going to be motivated\nto take home a medal as well still\nlooking pretty comfy as we start to head\nin to town in towards Luan City itself\nyou can see as our helicopter looks in\nto town the city surrounded by the\nforest and the Greenland and the\nFarmland that's has made up so much of\nthe world championships this year our\nleader with five kilomet to go and\nnearly a minute lead over second place\nwell Len saw the mountain bike\neliminated World Championship finish in\n2020 it saw the Road Race Championship\nfinish in\n2021 is now going to see the gravel\nWorld Championship finish for\n2024 and I'm sure that the road\nChampionship is going back to Len as\nwell I think it's\n2030 don't quote me on that I'm sure\nI'll get slaughtered uh on social media\nif I've got that room but I'm pretty\nsure it's is l uh for 2013 cuz ner the\nabsolute Legend on the mic speaker that\nyou will hear in the finish I think has\nsaid that he's going to make that his\nlast race if I remember correctly it has\nbeen a long weekend watching a lot of\ngravel racing on the way through keeping\nup with all of our Raiders the action\nand the racing here today and yesterday\na fantastic weekend a fantastic Festival\nof gravel racing and for me that massive\ncommunity of gravel Riders all coming\ntogether to race the World Championships\nis what gravel is about and we're seeing\nthe best riders in the world that race\nthis out the 5 km marker is in front and\nnow alongside our race leader the\ncaption says 4.3 I'll let you work out\nor guess which is I think it to be\nbrutally honest it doesn't matter he's\nclear this surely should be his a can't\nthat make a mistake that Gap will come\ndown but he can afford a slight\nmechanical issue if that were to happen\nbut he's kept it clean he's kept it\nhe's looked after that bike so far now\nchasing a group Conor Swift back on the\nfront here can we stop calling it a\nchasing group at this stage I think we\nprobably can I think we can call this\nthe battle for third well let's call it\nthe battle for third then why not the\nbattle for\nbronze be careful iteration date a theme\nof the commentary box for several hours\nearlier on today so as we make our way\nin to was our finish in Lou our race\nleader clear at the from Matthew vandero\ngetting the Applause it may be expected\nbut it is never uh something that we\ndon't want to see because this is an\nabsolute masterclass a master at work\nMatthew vandero the living legend that\nis vandero such a young Rider with such\na great pal marus of Rider I first saw\nin the flashh in I which at the European\nchampionships I think he was in the\nJunior cycl cross European championships\nin each I which organized by Steve\ngrimwood and the team at El Cycles a\nlong long time ago you know what he's\ngot that same fire that same fun that\nsame love of riding now that he had\nthen well the crowds in Len are ready to\nwelcome these Raiders home with 3.2 km\nto go glor forish was with Matthew\nvandero for such a long time but when\nVander attacked the Mish could not go\nwith him he's clear Now 49 seconds\nbehind vandero but over two minutes\nclear of the group battling for bronze\nat the moment this is the last three\nkilometers of racing for Florian Vish he\nhas to get the bike across the line to\ntake the silver medal and that will be\ntwo silver medals in a row he dly would\nhave Lo loved the gold I'm sure but\nlet's see if his what his face shows as\nhe goes only a young R 25 years old from\nagain as we said earlier this will be a\nHome Country medal if he takes away the\nsilver medal at the moment though the\nbattle for bronze well they are still\nnot engaging fully here the work being\ndone by Connor Swift here has been\nforced into that position a Workhorse of\nthe Donnie Chen gang when he's out and\nriding round his Hometown Road he is one\nof those Riders when he comes out on his\nhometown Chain Gang everybody else goes\noh we're going to suffer today well at\nthe moment he is at the hands of some of\nthe fastest riders in the world out on\nthe gravel road of L in that battle the\nbronze leading the race out though look\nat the speed Matthew vandero is s around\nhere he's not necessarily Taking Chances\nbut the way he carries momentum he's\nridden this okay he's wrecked this he's\ndone it a race BAS last time round but\nhe has this absolutely D it is such a\nsuch a delight to watch him in action it\nis indeed it is fabulous to watch him in\naction and riding and racing these final\ntwo kilometers now in Len he's got the\nshort sharp cobbled climb he's got the\nfinal gravel section and then he's got\nthe one kilometer of tarmac into the\nFinish Line to go floring for Mish comes\nsub 2K left well he's checking over to\nthe camera what information they're\ngiving him giving it a huff and a puff\nbut he has worked hard today I think a\nsigh of relief maybe from Flor he knows\nhe's now in to the final sections as's\nMatthew vandero is there no slowing this\nman down he's onto the climb he's out of\nthe saddle he sprits up so fast he can\nmake the other ridders jump out of the\nskin as he goes past him he has ascended\nthis for the L time today and listen to\nthe crowds at the side they knew who was\nheading their Direction they're seeing\nhim in person the leader of the race\nwith just under one and a half kilom to\nthe Finish he goes on to this gravel\nsection now he can pick his line he\ndoesn't need to take any chances at\nall just wants to keep that bike in one\npiece to make it to the Finish safely\nand smoothly just searches that wide\nline smoother line around the outside of\nthis long flowing bend around the edge\nof the Parkland here with the rainbow\nstripes on the ground welcome to Len it\nsays welcome to Len Matthew vandero\nyou'll be getting the real thing to pull\nover your shoulders soon as floran\nvishes on to the climb a little bit more\nlabor less BCE less spring but you know\nwhat what a ride from our Belgian Rider\nhere today in second place\nthere's nothing you could do today to\nbeat Vander Paul though I think he\nshowed he was the strongest or he showed\nhe was the fastest Rider he's into town\nthe crowds are absolutely packing the\nbarriers here cheering on the Riders\nwhat support this sets the standard\nthese are the crowds we want to see at a\ngravel World Championships well he had\none mission to win the world\nchampionship title and he is coming now\ntowards the final Street here in lven\nthe heart of Len about to welcome\nMatthew vandero home at the UCI gravel\nworld championships for\n2024 this is a real run this is should\nbe a lap of Honor for the rider from the\nNetherlands he takes a look across at\nthe bike as he whips through that\nchicane there he smiles on the crowd\nhe's around that corner this is the Run\nfor the line well he does it here in\nstyle the gravel World Championships in\nFlanders it's Matthew vandero from the\nNetherlands that's the Finish Line he is\ncoming down taking the Applause of the\ncrowd he rode away from floring Vish in\nand well he over finish is nowhere to be\nseen Matthew vaner PA taking the\nApplause of The Crow\ntaking the world championship title here\nfor 2024 in Len your UCI gravel world\nchampion Matthew\nvandero what a rider what a

helmet\ngreat ride and Chapo of course to\nMatthew van the race winner one and two\nin and over the line the battle for\nbronze well we're going to have to wait\na little bit longer to see that earn for\nas Matthew of vandero very calm cool and\ncollected takes a drink\nso impressive and here comes floring V\nso it looks like fling V going to\ncongratulate the race winner as the\nbattle for Bron the riders in that fight\nfor third place just overtaking one of\nthe lap Riders here as they come in\nthrough so these five Riders reminder\nMatti mod the defending Campion with the\nnumber one he's

he going to do about mod are we\ngoing to see GI V they are across the\nroad here and stens is just eing off\nnobody wants to lead this out they're\nlooking behind they're virtually rolling\nfreewheeling in Herman's on the right\nhand side he's got Jenny V now Herman\nwinds it up through the middle he STS\nagain little bit of a kick they were\nlooking to see the response here I think\nthey're worried about V behind moich\nquickly into position on Swiss wheel so\nfive Riders the leading five riders in\nthis group The motorbikes are blockage\nthe Riders behind the straight is\nentered 500 M on that corner they are\nclear they're looking for the kick\neverybody twitching nobody putting in\nthat final killer move at the moment and\nthis is going to come down to who

away\nwhat a Sprint finish what a run in over\nthe line at the final run to that line\nQuinton Herman's what a ride he was\ntightening his shoes up as well he might\nthat's going to be frustration for mod\nand Swift but there was nothing they\ncould do with the Riders around\nthem well the Sprint for the bronze did\nnot disappoint and we are going to hear\nfrom our\nwinner what many congratulations it's of\ncourse not your first world title you\nhave one on the road you have six in\ncyclocross but it's the first world\ntitle in gravel how much or how hard do\nyou appreciate this world title yeah a\nlot um yeah it was a a big goal for me\num it's super nice to yeah add another\nrainbow to the collection uh in another\ndist discipline as well so I'm uh I'm\nsuper happy with this one is that the\nmost important one to show yourself as\nan\nallrounder uh not really um but for sure\nyeah it's super nice um also to finish\nthe season like this um yeah uh it's\namazing you were very active in the race\nalready starting at 150 km from the end\nI think was that the key today to be\nvery active to be all the time in the\nfront yeah I just wanted to make the\nrace uh as hard as possible because new\non the local lip um yeah with a with a\nbig group it could be um yeah it could\nbe a difficult situation for me so I\ntried to put everybody on the limit and\num yeah when Florian ver went and we we\nwere with the two of us um yeah we had a\ngood cooperation so um yeah like I said\nit was super hard race but I enjoyed it\nand of course I'm super happy with the\nwith the title and you prefer to go all\nalone instead of spring with two yeah\nyou never know I have to say I was also\nuh my legs were also hurting so you\nnever know in a Sprint especially on the\ngravel bike so um yeah I tried one last\ntime on the hardest part of the of the\ncourse and yeah found myself alone so\nit's uh it's always nice to celebrate\nlike this\num for\nand\nthank\nyou well Matthew vandero very happy with\nthe hard race and going clear on that\nlast lap around Len from floran Vish\ntaking the gold medal and the rainbow\njersey in the world championships here\nuh in style in absolute style and I\nthink it was really interesting this is\na Ryder who's won on the road World\nChampionships the cycl cross world\nchampion he rides a mountain bike as\nhard as he plays fortnite on the\ncomputer uh the UCI covers so many\ndisciplines you have to wonder what\nMatthew vandero could not win at and he\nhas shown today I think that he is the\nallr round Rider he's tactical now to\nchoose the right moment to attack he\ndidn't want it to come to a Sprint he\nwas saying his legs were tired and when\nyou sprint on tired legs you never ever\nknow you can be the best printer in the\nworld but that fatigue can take its stll\nand it can come around and bite you and\nthat he didn't want that to happen\nstylish race stylish win stylish Rider\nabsolute superb performance from Matthew\nvandero and I have to say uh really\nreally impressive riding no surprises he\nis the champion for\n2024 given his appearance on the St L\nyou would always not want to bet against\nthis man but he was pushed and he had\ncompany on the way through the\nbelgiumsgottalent12\nthe gold medal floring Vish put in a\nphenomenal performance to take second\nplace today he just could not stay with\nvaner pole on that last attack no he\ncouldn't he is just a little bit younger\nhe's a rider who maybe has not had those\nsame successes that Vander Paul has but\nhe's shown um the consistency to take\naway two silver medals in two years to\nget on that Podium time and time again\nabsolutely impressive performance this\nSprint for me this this really showed\nthe frustration it summed up the race\nthe belgians playing tactics Matti modri\ntrying everything he could along with\nConnor Swift they really fought but when\none Rider from Belgium was fading you\ncould just see the pressure was on you\ncan see though Herman's almost putting\nVish into the barrier there his own\nteammate there his own Countryman but he\nhad the power to kick down that stra you\ncan see the frustration from Vish as he\ncomes to line stens had nothing left in\nthere and it is a Hermes who takes away\nthe bronze medal but the two Riders from\nthe non Belgian countries they're\ngetting worked over well truly on the\nrun into the line hermans with that kick\nin that finish um clearly wanting it\nclearly knowing that he had that Sprint\nin there and a a great result for belgi\nin the sense of two medals but they will\nbe frustrated here not to have taken the\nChampionship win in Len well there is\nalways next year in 2025 the gravel\nWorld Championships heads to nce in\nFrance I'm sure we going to see a number\nof these Riders back and uh Floren Vish\nI think is going to want a gold medal I\nexpect he does you can see the reaction\nthere of Matthew vandero so you can see\nhe knows exactly what's been going on\nbehind the Riders updated backstage if\nyou've not had uh the amazing privilege\nof being backstage it is a very special\nplace where the Riders just relax a\nlittle bit before they go to the podium\nyou can see Matthew vander's race win\nhere and your top 10 Riders Matthew\nVander taking the win in 4 hours 41\nminutes 24 s Flor in second Quinton\nHermes in third Sten and J for M from\nBelgian head of Connor Swift and mat\nmorerich in sixth and seventh Tim Mia\nleading in that chasing group behind in\neighth place with Teo keik and ton s all\nBelgium Riders heading in the big chase\npack all top 10 riders coming through\nfour minutes 15 separating group number\nthree on the road from the eventual\nleader two solo Riders and then two\ngroups chasing into the finish here in\nLen so great racing here today from our\nRiders um the very rightly Elation\ncoming from Matthew vandero Sil a row\nmany congratulations with the second\nplace because losing of mat vpol is is\nnot a shame of course but how do you\nlook back on your\nrace yeah it was uh was a super hard\nrace from the beginning uh the pace was\nsuper high and when we arrived on the\nlocal lap uh yeah we were immediately I\nthink with a group of 10 or 15 guys and\nI knew when uh when we were only with\nsix or seven guys I had to be one of the\nfirst to get away and ideally to get\nmat or someone else with me and that\nthat's what happened and then it all\ncame down to uh who was the strongest\nand I I think uh everybody saw clearly\nuh who who it was you you felt that\nalready uh when you were riding with him\ntwo guys in front you knew he would do\nsomething on the capella dri yeah I was\nuh I know I would uh I would get dropped\nwhen he accelerated but I I just Tred to\nto uh yeah to do the best I could and uh\nyeah in the end it was the strongest who\nwon uh you could see it already when he\ndid the turns in the front it was always\na bit longer than me and a bit harder so\nthen you know uh that you feel who's the\nstrongest\num\nperson\nso great hear from from floring of am\njust reflecting back on his race there\nand how hard that race really was and\nthat he knew that Vander Paul was the\nstrongest in it showed today which it\ndid and I really hope that we do see him\nin action on lots more gravel race I\nhope this inspired you to jump on your\nbike as well whether your local gravel\nraces is over in Leadville or whether\nyou're going to be out in N fantastic\nracing and that is all part of gravel I\nthink are we going to have chance to\nhear from third\nplace hermans uh many congratulations as\nI said also to floran and to\nm point on was it clear for you that\nthat was the\nmax um to uh to ride together with the\nteam and uh I think we did it quite well\nbut uh yeah of course when Mao attacked\nalready I think with 120k to go or\nsomething you felt uh it was uh going to\nbe a tough race uh then uh we had a\nsplit with a couple of good Riders and\nthen uh yeah we come together uh we go\ninto the last lap with I think seven or\neight Riders and all strong so then you\nknow it's going to be hard to keep the\ngroup together and then my attacked\nagain and then you know it's going to be\nquite hard to uh uh to go for the first\nor the second place but uh yeah I'm\nhappy uh I can finish it off with third\nwhat's your evaluation of this world\nchampionship and then I don't mean on a\npersonal level more like the event do\nyou like it was it was it a nice day in\nthe saddle yeah it was nice but of\ncourse super hard uh I think here in\ngravel it's really uh everyone uh is\nfighting for their own uh there's almost\nno team tactics uh it's just the legs\nwho who speak and it's I think it's a\nnice event especially here in Belgium\nwith with the crowds that was super nice\ngreat for\noff\nfor over\nthank you\nwell fantastic racing here in living\ngreat to see Riders battling the way\ninto that Finish Line in all of the\ngroups whever they are out on the road\nyou can see this run for the line little\nbit further down through the B that\nlooks to me like that's potentially\nCameron Mason I think just coming

Thank\nyou.\nOh, that is\nSo bad day today with the weather.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, actually you know the only thing I\nbrought was rain gear. So I it was kind\nof satisfying to\n&gt;&gt; to use it. Very good.\nWhat's that?\n&gt;&gt; Playing with a ball.\nThe plan is\nVorola Fedaya\nJao and then we will see if I will leave\nCotina again.\n&gt;&gt; Me too\nor stay there. We will see.\n&gt;&gt; I've been at SA and Ptoy already today.\nOh,\n&gt;&gt; okay.\n&gt;&gt; I slept in Kanesai and now the third\npass for today. So I'm quite happy.\n&gt;&gt; Good morning.\n&gt;&gt; Hi. Hello.\n&gt;&gt; 10.6 did it.\nin here by kilome.\nFore\nsex.\nfor\nthis checkpoint. Okay. So\nyeah,\nIt's tough today.\nYeah. Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. Okay.\nOkay, sister.\nFuel.\nuh at last checkpoint. But it was really\nbeautiful because uh there was almost no\ntraffic and the weather was super nice\nand I was super early so I could have my\nbreakfast coffee on top of Gabia and\nthat was really pretty cool. Uh and then\nWhat did I also like? I like just the\nbee parking because you find lots of\nplaces where you can just sneak away\nbehind some kind of bush and just sleep.\nAnd I like Italy for the food. Uh I\nthink the road is super nice.\nUm it started hurt, but I guess that's\nnormal. I'm wearing two pants now\nbecause my ass is hurting too much with\none p. So that's that's my life for the\nmoment. Uh, but it's nice and I'm going\nto make it, I think. Um, it's like raw\nmeat for the moment. So, I I have the\nthe cream for during the day when I'm\ncycling. And then yesterday, I stopped\nat the pharmacist for like a cream when\nyou have burns.\n&gt;&gt; Three team.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I don't know the name. It's uh\nYeah, it's it helps now with two pants.\nNow I can I can cycle.\n&gt;&gt; Uh but it's mainly when I go up, it\ndoesn't hurt too much. It's what comes\nnow or uh the flat pieces those will\n&gt;&gt; but I have good good rest this night and\nI had a beer yesterday and beer from\ntime to time does magic.\n&gt;&gt; Uh and I always eat two pastas every\nevery evening. No matter how hungry I am\nor not hungry or too tired, I sit until\nthey're finished and that helps. Pasta\nis really\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. And you're you're sleeping in the\nbushes.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, like last night I slept at a\ncampsite because of the the ass problem.\nI needed a shower. But now I think I'll\nfind something else.\n&gt;&gt; Uh but I've never been around here, so I\ndon't know. But I guess there will\nalways be something in the valley to\nhide behind. Um so I'll find something,\nI guess.\n&gt;&gt; Hi\nShould\nattack some\ngood attack some\nNice\n&gt;&gt; good\nline.\n&gt;&gt; It's gate.\n&gt;&gt; Compton gate.\n&gt;&gt; I bought to go up to walk.\nUh-huh.\ngiving interviews with the heartbeat of\n200 per minute.\n&gt;&gt; And I will make it\n&gt;&gt; to go\n&gt;&gt; that way. Sure.\nthis way.\n&gt;&gt; Well, that's\nideal situation will be only gross\ntomorrow and then\n&gt;&gt; chill last day. There is one small ramp\nbefore post\n&gt;&gt; I'm not sure if it's Nashville pass or\nsomething else but it looks\n&gt;&gt; Nashville is 7 and something kilometers\nI think.\n&gt;&gt; So not too far from here\n&gt;&gt; I think after Ponta. So this is kilome\n120 of the GPX Ponta is I think 200\n&gt;&gt; and then immediately afterwards I no not\nimmediately\nsomething close to it it starts.\n&gt;&gt; But something else um before cross so\ntake a look at it. It looks really\nnasty.\n&gt;&gt; But okay.\n&gt;&gt; And also if it's mentally prepared, it's\ngoing to be more than just\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I know.\n&gt;&gt; I also don't know where you can sleep\naround here or something. But yeah,\n&gt;&gt; yesterday I was very lucky. I asked the\nguy and I could sleep there.\n&gt;&gt; Cool. A stable.\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\nLet's\ntarget.\nForeignech.\ngood girl.\nand a meters up.
