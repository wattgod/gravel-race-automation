        "explanation": "Zero mention of pro riders, no notable past winners, and no prize purse data tells you everything. This is a regional Montana event that doesn't even register on the national gravel radar. The fact that it's just 'returning' for 2025/2026 with no founding story or history suggests it's either brand new or died quietly before."
      },
      "race_quality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "A three-stage format sounds ambitious until you realize Stage 2 is 68% pavement and Stage 3 is 60% pavement. You're paying gravel race fees for what's essentially a road race with gravel sprinkles. The 9-mile Friday time trial is pure gravel, but that's hardly enough to salvage the weekend's identity crisis."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Early May in Montana means 'Mud, rain, snow…who knows what to expect' according to their own marketing. That's adventure, not reliability. The three-day format spreads thin content across a long weekend, and with significant pavement sections, you're not getting the pure gravel experience most riders want."
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Coffee and treats at Saturday morning registration is nice, but there's zero evidence of any rider community or culture around this event. No rider reviews, no race reports, no social media buzz found anywhere. It's listed alongside Garden City Gravel in the Montana scene, but that's geographic proximity, not community proof."
      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Recreation and paracyclist divisions suggest they're struggling to fill competitive fields. No field size data, no results from previous years, and pricing that goes as low as $27.50 screams 'please someone register.' When an event offers virtual participation for $50, they're grasping for any warm bodies."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Three days for $150 isn't terrible math, especially with the recreation option at $100 for self-paced riders. Individual stages run $40-110, so the package deal makes sense if you want the full experience. Registration doesn't close until race day at 4pm, which means they're not selling out but also not gouging."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Huson is 30 miles from Missoula, so you've got airport access and lodging options without resort pricing. The registration range of $40-150 keeps things reasonable, and on-site packet pickup means no shipping fees. Early May timing avoids peak Montana tourism costs."
      },
      "length": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "The three stages total around 110+ miles over the weekend - Stage 1 at 11 miles, Stage 2 at 56 miles, Stage 3 at 45 miles. That's solid volume without being punitive, and the format lets you pick individual stages if you don't want the full commitment. Friday's 9-mile time trial is a reasonable opener."
      },
      "technicality": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "With 60-68% of two stages being pavement, technical challenge is limited to the gravel sections and the pure-gravel Friday time trial. The Rocky Mountain Roubaix circuit suggests some technical terrain, but four laps of the same 11-mile loop reduces navigation complexity. More rolling roads than gnarly gravel."
      },
      "elevation": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Stage 2 packs 3,000 feet into 56 miles while the other stages are mellower - 756 feet over 11 miles Friday, 1,711 feet over 45 miles Sunday. That's respectable climbing without being murderous, spread across terrain that's mostly paved where the watts matter most."
      },
      "climate": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Early May in Montana is a weather lottery that the organizers openly acknowledge: 'Mud, rain, snow…who knows what to expect.' You're rolling dice on conditions that could make or break the weekend. The only certainty is uncertainty, and that's not always fun when you've traveled for a race."
      },
      "altitude": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Huson sits around 3,000-4,000 feet elevation, which is noticeable but not debilitating for most riders. High enough to thin the air slightly, low enough that you won't be gasping if you're coming from sea level. The elevation gain per stage is more relevant than the starting altitude here."
      },
      "logistics": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "On-site registration and packet pickup sounds convenient until you realize there's no detailed info about parking, lodging recommendations, or course support. Being 30 miles from Missoula helps with access, but the lack of published logistics details suggests either poor organization or a very small, local-knowledge-required operation."
      },
      "adventure": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "The weather uncertainty and three-stage format across Montana gravel roads delivers legitimate adventure. The Nine Mile time trial and Petty Road/Southside routing suggests you'll see country most people never do. Sure, there's too much pavement, but early season Montana conditions will test you regardless of surface."
