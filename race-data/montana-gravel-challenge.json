Peter L's power data shows the TT takes ~20 minutes while Saturday requires 2+ hours of sustained effort. The format allows single-stage entries for riders not wanting the full omnium commitment. Similar distance to Crusher in the Tushar."

Similar technical demands to Gravel Worlds."

Similar elevation profile to Gravel Worlds."

Peter L's power numbers (338w average, 361w normalized for the TT) suggest the altitude impact is manageable for most riders. The elevation affects pacing more through the rolling terrain profile than thin air, based on his race experience data. Similar altitude considerations to Grinduro."

      "adventure": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Course routing adapts to conditions, with organizers shortening the TT and skipping dangerous gravel sections when weather deteriorates. Peter L describes Sunday's mud climb as \"a section I cut out of the TT on friday morning because it was a little iffy.\" The three-day format across Montana's variable spring conditions creates unpredictable challenges."

The Cycling House and Competitive Timing provide professional organization but not national-level competition."

Peter L calls Sunday the \"road race\" stage. Professional timing by Competitive Timing and proper course marking provide solid race infrastructure, but the surface breakdown doesn't match typical gravel race expectations."

Peter L tracked his recovery: \"yesterday morning I felt like garbage and my watch told me my 'training readiness' was 14. This morning it said 7 but I felt better.\" Weather variability and course changes keep riders adapting, though significant pavement mileage dilutes the pure gravel experience most seek."

Peter L's race reports focus on small group tactics and local age group battles rather than deep fields. The $40-150 price range and same-day registration availability point to accessibility over exclusivity. Thinner field than Ouray Gravel Grinder.

Peter L ran 34mm tires at 42-46 psi on his Orbea Terra with road wheels, noting \"The bike, wheel, and tire setup was perfect all weekend.\" Late April timing avoids peak Montana tourism pricing while maintaining access to Missoula's amenities.

          "transcript": "There's your conclusion. Wide tires\nwon't help you if you're crap at\noff-roading.\n[Music]\nHave you seen the size of these? These\nare my new gravel tires. I haven't used\nthem yet, as you can see. They're fresh\nout the box, but I'm going to see if I\ncan be converted to mountain bike tires\non my gravel bike. Basically, uh, you've\nprobably seen mountain bike style or\nmountain bike width gravel tires being\nused in lots of top tier gravel races.\nSo, Unbound, loads of people were using\n50 mil tires, whereas 45 mil used to be\nwide on gravel. No longer. And if your\nframe can fit them, then apparently we\nshould all be fitting really wide tires\nlike these. These are Continentals Race\nKing. They're 2.2 in wide. Luckily, the\nL can fit 57 mil tires, so there's a bit\nof room to spare. The physics is kind of\na bit counterintuitive, though. Like,\nwider tires, we've been told for so many\nyears, is slower, and now all of a\nsudden we're being told they're faster.\nI mean, there's no way that it's more\narrow. So, can it make up for it in\nrolling resistance? Well, I'm going to\ntry and find out. I've got a race at the\nweekend, a gravel race. It's called\nGripfest. It's in Mid Wales. And uh I've\ndone it for the last 3 years now. It's\none of my favorite gravel events and I'm\nI've been a bit torn on what bike to\nuse, what tires to use, but for the last\n3 years I've used Mal Seagler with the\nsuspension fork at the front and 45 mil\nSchwabby G1s. I've been quite happy on\nit. There's some stages where you feel\nlike you might want a hard tail mountain\nbike. There's other really fast bits\nwhere you feel like it's definitely\ngravel bike territory. So maybe this\nwill be the best of both worlds. Or\nmaybe I've just absolutely ruined my\ngravel bike. It's only one way to find\nout, isn't there?\nI have just realized a slight issue.\nThis front tire I've put on backwards.\nYou see around here it says rotation.\nThere's an arrow which quite clearly\ngoes not the way it's going to spin.\nThat's what you get when you fit tires\nat 10:00 at night.\nOkay, we're ready to ride. Um, I am\nintrigued to see how these tires\nperform. Um, we haven't had any issues\nwith them so far. So, uh, let's go on a\nride.\nWell, I've written about 10 m so far and\nI've spotted an issue already. Um, I now\nget to overlap.\nSo where I actually have my cleats quite\nfar I have my foot quite far back and\neven so\nyeah that's going to be really annoying\nwhen going slowly and trying to like do\nany technical bits. Maybe we should just\nall have hard tail mountain bikes if we\nwant to run mountain bike tires. Am I\ngoing to remove my cleats? Am I going to\nput up with it? Or am I going to change\nmy tires? Nah, let's just crack on.\nUh yeah, pretty positive on stuff like\nthis. They definitely feel nice. I\nhaven't done any like long really\nstraight fast bits yet. All the fast\nbits I've done have actually been a\nlittle bit rocky. So I guess find out\nthere whether they're more draggy,\nwhether there's that arrow penalty and\nwhether you can feel that. What I would\nsay is if you have a rock like that, if\nyou're on like a 38 mil or a 40 mil\ngravel tire, then you're going to want\nto go around that. Um on my 45 mil\ngravel tires, you'd be absolutely fine\ngoing over it. Like no problems. But\nwould I choose to go around it? Yes,\nprobably. If I saw that on the track and\nthere was a clear bit here, I would\nprobably choose to go around it. The\nwider your tire, the more you can go\nover basically or more it's comfortable\nto go over. The more you can go over\nwithout losing speed or rolling off the\nside of it. And what I have found is on\nthese tires, I just don't care as much\nwhat I'm riding over. Like on a track\nlike this, there's basically nothing\nthat you can't ride full pelt at. So,\nthat's quite nice. Um, but yeah, now to\ngo and find some climbs because\nobviously a penalty of using wider tires\nis usually additional weight. And if\nthere's not a weight penalty, then it\nnormally means they've got really\nfragile sidewalls and you're going to\ntear it as soon as you hit anything\nrocky. So, yeah, generally bit of a\nweight penalty. Let's go and find out if\nthat makes any difference.\nTest two. Come on, big tires. I haven't\ncleared this hill before. Can I clear\nthem on the mountain bike tires? Let's\ngo.\nI mean, I'm kind of glad I'm on these\nones, to be honest.\nOh, that's quite loose there, though.\nOh dear. Oh dear. I didn't choose to be\nover here. Ah, no. I still haven't\ncleared it then. Oh well.\nNeed to find a good spot. Get going\nagain.\nRight, we should be all right from\nthere.\nRight, wide tires. Be grippy. I'm not\nclipped in.\nYes. H planned my celebration and\neverything. Now I can't use it.\nTo be honest though,\nI would rather be on these tires for\nthat. My opinion at the moment is it\ndepends what gravel you want to be\nriding. If you want to ride more\nmountain bikey stuff, use mountain bike\ntires on your gravel bike. Although\nactually then you would just get a hard\ntail mountain bike. And that is\nsomething that I do strongly believe in.\nThere's lots of manufacturers pushing\nyou towards a gravel bike or like trying\nto tell you that that's the greatest\nthing in existence. I do agree they are\ngreat because a lot of people need to\nride on the road to get to their\noff-road. However, if you have a road\nbike, potentially an all-road bike. If\nyou don't race, you can basically get\naway with having an all-road bike. You\ncan do dusty trails on that. And then if\nyou want to go off off-road hard tail\nmountain bike, which of course you can\nstill use on the road, it just might be\na bit more draggy. So is the answer\nputting mountain bike tires on your\ngravel bike? Yes, it probably makes it\nbetter. But is a hard tail mountain bike\nnot even better? That's the next\nquestion I need to answer.\nonwards.\nAh,\nwell, test ride number one done. They've\ndone enough to convince me to use them\nat the weekend. So today we've sort of\nbeen well almost purely on either this\nsort of terrain uh like fire roads or\nmuch rockier stuff. And on here I've\nbeen enjoying them. I've been uh sold.\nHowever, I must admit we haven't done a\nlot well I haven't I barely touched any\ntarmac at all and I haven't done much\nfast stuff. I don't think I've gone\nabove like 25 kph the entire day. So,\nit'll be interesting at the weekend to\nsee when things do get a bit faster cuz\nthere's a real mix of stages. Some of\nthem are quite technical, uh, rocky like\nsome of the stuff we've done today, and\nthen other bits are just half an hour\nsegment, go rolling, but fast, open\nfire track like this. So, yeah,\nintriguing. Um, from what I've seen so\nfar, not a bad effort from the mountain\nbike tires at all.\nRight, before we get on to the\nconclusion of this video, please do make\nsure you subscribe to the channel\nbecause, well, it really does help us\nmake as much bike content as possible.\nSo, yeah, click the button and uh\nwithout further ado, here is the bike\nthat I used for Gripfest. So, this is\nthe setup that I chose to use. And as\nyou will see, it does indeed have the\nwide tires still fitted. And in the end,\nI think that that probably was the right\ndecision for me because, well, in\ntypical Welsh fashion, the the weather\ntook a turn for the worse and uh it was\nno longer quite so dusty off-road. And I\nam 99% sure that the wide tires are the\nfaster option. Now, it's very hard to\nmeasure aerodynamics in the real world,\nbut lots of pros, all those pro riders\nUnbound that you see using wide tires,\nthey have had plenty of wind tunnel\ntime. And if they're doing it, then it's\nquite easy to imagine that me and you\ntraveling at much lower speeds\ninevitably, then there's even more\nbenefit to using wide tires. So, let's\nget into that a bit deeper. On descents,\nI was definitely more confident and less\nwary of my line choices when using these\ntires. On technical sections, I was glad\nof the additional grip. And on the road,\nI was pleasantly surprised by how well\nthese Race Kings rolled. Wide tires\nsound like a nailedon winner then. But\nmy choice does come with a few caveats.\nI hate saying it depends, but it it\nreally does depend. It depends on what\ngravel you will be riding. If you just\nwant to do some light toe paths and\nthings like that, then fit a 45 mil fit\nand forget. You don't need anything\nwider. However, if you want to travel as\nfast as possible over a whole range of\ngravel surfaces, then I think basically\nfit as wide as your frame will allow.\nAnd that's a good point actually because\na lot of frames won't take tires this\nwide. And well, that makes your decision\nquite easy, doesn't it? Now, I do think\nthat bike manufacturers are going to\nhave to listen to consumers and the\nscience and start making their\nclearances a lot wider. And they have,\nto be fair, a lot of even the race\nbikes, race gravel bikes that we've seen\nreleased this year have got those wider\nclearances. That Villia Rave ID2 springs\nto mind. Now, I say that fit as wide a\ntire as possible. And then I'm actually\ngoing to contradict myself almost\nimmediately because what I now want to\ndo to this bike is move down to a 50 mil\ntire. So these are 55 mil, 2.2 in. I\nthink a 2.1 in or 50 mil is going to be\nthe sweet spot for my riding and this\nbike. And I'm hoping I'm making that\ndecision because I'm hoping that it will\neliminate that toe overlap that you saw\nI got earlier. Therefore, hopefully I\ncan have all the benefits of big tires\nwithout any of the negatives. In\nconclusion, then, wide gravel tires have\ndone enough to convince me that they are\na genuine option rather than just a\ngimmick. Let me know whether you agree\nor disagree with my tire choice down in\nthe comments below, as well as any\nquestions that you'd like us to answer\non the channel next. We'll see you next",

          "transcript": "three two one here we go\nthe canyon waffle ride underway\nokay\noh yeah\nyou all right\n[Music]\nokay so before we jump into the race i\nwant to break down how i'm feeling how\ni'm going into this and my\nuh gear setup now the day of the race my\nwhoop score was 85\nso great i am feeling super good which\nwas good to see that\ntuesday and wednesday i was in the red\npretty much the whole week i was a turd\nnow have you ever seen this video where\nthis guy's bandaged up he has everything\nhe can possibly put on him to help him\nperform\nand then even with all those things that\nare trying to help him out he just fails\ninstantly\nthat's kind of how i'm doing i am\nbandaged up here i've got an arrow\nhelmet\ntry to help me go fast i've got 60\nmilligrams of ketones that's a lot\ni've got my amp lotion on my legs i've\ngot 600 calories 300 milligrams of\ncaffeine\nuh in gels on me i've got 900 calories\n300 grams of carbs in my bottles i've\ngot 50 psi\non 38 with aero wheels from princeton so\nmy setup is fast i've also got super\nstiff\nroad shoes i'm on the canyon grail which\nhas a gear ratio that my best is 34\n40 i'm really happy with this setup i'm\nfeeling good and\nwe're ready to just go as hard as we\npossibly can\nmy training has been really good going\ninto this and so we're gonna break this\ndown into\nthe different sectors so the first like\nsector one\nand two uh of gravel this includes our\nlittle lead in here\num it's 124 miles 200 kilometers\neveryone's got their masks on at the\nstart everyone's really trying to\nvie for the front because there's i mean\nthere's a lot of people here and there's\na big pinch point\nnow right here instantly there's a crash\nand what actually ended up happening is\nthat guy like pushed my back brake\nin i lost my back brake for a little\nwhile it came back eventually\nbut it was really scary uh to almost\nhave my race ended immediately\nso now we go through this tunnel and i\nknew that we pre-ridden this so i knew\nthis was going to be an\nimportant part i thought i was far\nenough up front\neveryone's just getting crammed in here\neveryone can't go and this is exactly\nwhat\ntravis had predicted is that it was\ngonna just be a total [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] show here\nyou can see cole in the white he\nactually dropped his chain so he's\nrunning through the tunnel um\nand so now full gas i mean you have\njust shot out of a cannon where you were\nyou know it's cold it's like 40 degrees\nthat was a big component of it is how\ncold it was at the start so\ni've i was actually really dialed in my\nldl gear i had like a\nthermal jacket and a vest gloves the\nwhole the whole thing\nbut so we are now trying to catch the\nfront group\nyou can't see anything i know that you\ncan see quite well here\nbut the dust was so bad i mean i could\nnot see the front i didn't know how far\nthey were\nand when we pre-rode this one of the\nbiggest mistakes is that when me and\ntravis pre-rode this we did not\nride it at race pace and the gravel is\ncompletely different when you are doing\n25 30 miles an hour versus doing 17.\nso everything felt way more rough and\nloose\nand just really unfamiliar\nand so now again my legs feel like\na ton of bricks because there was really\nno warm-up i mean we coasted into this\nlittle tunnel and then all of a sudden\nyou are full gas and so i'm trying to\nstay on some wheels we're going over\nthis climb guys are getting\nspit out there's gaps everywhere and i'm\nthinking\nthis was it i mean i've made it a whole\none mile\ninto the race before i'm no longer in\ncontention\nuh and i you know i don't even know what\nposition i'm in i don't know how\nfar up the front group is we finally do\ncome together and i'm like huh whoo\nglad that uh i saved this one right so\ni'm\nkind of trying to regroup gather myself\nand then there's a big wreck\nand it's so difficult to make quick\nadjustments because of how the gravel is\nso\ni saw that wreck coming from a while but\ni just couldn't stop or couldn't get\naround it\nso now again full gas chasing we're\ntrying to get back onto the group\nand we really need to get back on it\nbefore we start going downhill so you\ncan see\nthe front group up there it's it's a\nlittle hard to see\nuh but i don't know how far away they\nare i don't know if we're gonna catch i\ndon't know\nanything man um it's we are\nat elevation so it's about almost 6 000\nfeet above sea level\nand so then with the full gas poop pants\neffort\nright off the beginning and it being\ncold my brain is dead i really have no\nidea what's going on i have no far\ni have no idea how far back i am i'm\njust trying to pedal and so then now we\nhit the\nnext dirt section which this is like\nslightly downhill\nand again i know that it maybe looks\nlike you can see\nyou can't see you can't see 20 feet 30\nfeet in front of you\nand so if someone crashes which a lot of\npeople were you could just\nfull send right over the top of them and\nso i was being a little bit cautious\nhere\nuh definitely through these tunnels i\nwas just also\nreally disappointed with how my legs\nfelt in that\nopening of 10 minutes they just felt\nlike absolute bricks\ni don't know kind of intimidated a\nlittle bit thinking oh man i\njust do not have it today uh\ntrying to stay on these guys wheels i\nthe whole time\ni was sort of always just like a bike or\ntwo off of\neveryone's wheel and i just think that\nthat\ncomes from i just wasn't comfortable not\nknowing where i was going or\nwhat like i couldn't see i wanted to see\ni wanted to see what i was riding over\nuh we're flying through it's such a\nbeautiful scenery\nfor one it was gorgeous um the gravel's\npretty chunky here again\nat full gas race pace it is completely\ndifferent than we pre-wrote it\nwe do finally have everyone come\ntogether and so\ni guess i've made the front group but\nit's really big\nand so then i'm expecting you know that\nthis group is going to probably stay\nthis size for a little bit also again\njust not really thinking\nat elevation early the whole thing my\nbrain was just\nturned off and at this point i should\nhave\nfought as hard as i could to get to the\nfront we didn't pre-ride this part of\nthe course\nand uh or when we turned right here and\ni should have because i was\nway out of position you know probably\nlike top 50 here\nnow unfortunately this next section is\nit was the most important section\nand i have no footage of it my gopro\ndied\nand once we hit this section there was\nno way\ni could take my hand off to change the\nbattery so as we turn off this road\nsection and\nto basically where the first climb was\nyou know you can just see how way out of\nposition i am i'm probably top\n50 and i i just didn't know man i just\nhad no idea i guess how skinny this road\nwas or how it was going to play out\nbut this is where the front just lit it\nup\nand i could see nothing and i i don't\nhave really a good gopro shot this was\nprobably one of the most beautiful\nsections of the race and the gopro just\ndidn't get it\nright but is what it is you couldn't see\nanything and there were some downhill\nsections\nwhere you were just full sending into\ndust\nand there could be someone crashed i\nthere could be huge holes you just don't\nknow and so\nwe hit the first kom and i started\nreally feeling good my legs just came to\num i was feeling super confident and\nthen so once i kind of got through a few\nguys i'd realized\nthe front group is gone i can't even see\nthem\nso by the time i got to the front of the\nsecond group\nit's like shoot dude the race is pretty\nmuch over and then there's this huge\ndownhill section that i don't have on\nfootage\nand you know is everyone just doing what\nthey could to try to\nform their group okay so this next\nsection\nfor me personally was one of the hardest\nsections because guys were\nreally trying to bridge up to groups\nthey were trying to get back on terms\nwith the race\nyou know average 274 for this section\nwhich doesn't sound like a whole lot\nbut it really was um i got into a decent\ngroup of some strong guys\nand we were kind of picking up\num people getting blown off from the\ni have no idea where i am on the road at\nthis point\ni'm really starting to feel good it sort\nof feels like we're maybe the second or\nthird\ngroup on the road at this point and then\nit starts getting pretty technical\nthey have these little over under things\nand now\nwe're into these long stretches\nwhere the road is sort of split and line\nchoice was so important\ni swear it was like if you chose the\nwrong side of the road you'd be doing\n50 percent more energy or hit a patch of\nsand and\ngo to a complete stop it was uh it was\ncrazy how\ndifferent one line was and it would\nchange\nand so here i'm feeling super good and\nso now i'm just\npowering i'm getting over this the the\n50 psi and my 38s um are keeping me\nsuper efficient like i'm rolling so\nfast it is way unstable that was the big\nissue though\nis that i would hit little bumps and i\nkept coming unclipped\nlike there was because of the psi being\nso hard i'd hit little bumps and my\nliterally my shoes would just come out\nof the pedals which was something that\ni've\nreally never experienced i'm pushing the\npace this kid had caught us\nand is just drilling it i mean i'm doing\nlike 300 350 watts in his draft\nnow i'm going to kind of try to show you\nhow the groups were forming\nright so there you got the front group\nof like seven\ndylan johnson he's in it he did a\nphenomenal\nuh then you've got a bunch of guys blown\nout of that front group kind of coming\nbackwards\nthen you had a good sized group um that\nwas like a chase group\nokay and then my group which is a\nhandful of us\ntrying to get back on terms right and so\ni guess we're like the fourth group on\nthe road at this moment\nthen you have a bunch of guys that are\njust blown out of everyone and they're\ngoing back\neither having issues then you had a\npretty good sized group of some fast\nguys\ncoming um and then pretty much everyone\nelse\nyou know sort of just at this point\ngoing you know what our day's\nprobably over we're just gonna try to\nenjoy the ride\num you know a lot of people had crashes\nmechanicals\nissues in the beginning so i'm really\ngrateful that i\ni didn't have any mechanicals the next\nsector is\nfeels pretty flat but there's just a lot\nof little technical aspects\nwe hit some sand on this section uh\nwe're about two hours in at this point\nand so again the left or right\nyou know you could just be hauling balls\nand then all of a sudden\nthe lane that you were in was terrible\num\ni like i said i was always just slightly\noff everyone\ni was constantly trying to get back on\nterms uh\nhitting some sand now this\nsand was super deep and there was a lot\nof times where\nit was very easy for you to unclip and\nthen have to walk\ni didn't have to do that i was able to\nkeep my power up and really push through\nbut again some you can see the guy on\nthe left he had such a better line\ni'm just you know in the beach sand but\ni'm trying to save my power\nright so right now i could bridge that\ngap in front of me to this dude\nbut i'm not gonna be able to see where\ni'm going if i'm right on his wheel\nand then i'm gonna have to burn a match\nand i'm trying to keep it pretty steady\nmy power wise especially for this event\nif i just stay\nzone 3 low zone 4 i should be really\ngood\nso then now we get into a little more\nsand\nand a little bit of a climb everything's\ngood my\nchain though is so dry my chain was\nmaking noises i've never heard a chain\nmake before it felt like it was gonna\nsnap at any moment\nso now here's kind of how the groups are\nthere was a\nfew guys just up the road within\nbridgeable distance that i could get to\nuh but there was also a bunch of guys\nbehind me\nand so then i kind of had to make this\ndecision on what which group i was going\nto go with\nand i chose to stop and get some chain\nlube\nand then followed the group behind me\nthinking that the group behind me we\ncould\nget together and chase down the group in\nfront of us which actually ended up\nworking out great\nso then now this next section is sort of\nnot a whole lot going on but there was a\nbig road climb\non this section so on the road you can\nsee that it's me and these these three\nother guys and we're kind of trying to\ncatch this\nuh the little blue four guys up the road\nwe're not really making\nany sort of gain on them and\nthere's a huge group behind us that is\njust motoring\nso me and these three other guys sort of\nmake the collective decision to\nease up and go back to the group that's\ngaining on us anyway\nright and so which was a great decision\nbecause you could be going\nso hard uh but if there's like this\ngroup\nthey are not going that hard and they're\njust covering so much distance\nso it was really good to get in with\nthem especially going into the\nfirst or i think the second kom now that\nthis big climb here is on road so again\nmy 50 psi\nmy 38's my irc's uh\nthey're called the double cross they\nwere rolling\nso fast now guys started to break up\nit was pretty difficult it's pretty long\nclimb and so then you've got these guys\nup front\nthat are pushing the pace and i had to\ntry to bridge this gap you know i again\nit's really hard to know who's strong\nand who's not who's feeling it\num but on this climb it did that big\ngroup there\ni don't want to say it split in half but\na few people didn't make it over this uh\nthis big\nroad climb yeah my time on this kom\nactually gave me third overall in my age\nfor the km competition so we get over\nthe top everyone's sort of shaking their\nlegs out\nuh trying to feel out what this next\nsection is going to be like\nfeeling pretty good at this point you\nknow i've put down some good calories\nsome good carbs\nthose ketones are freaking magic and so\nthen this next section\nhas a little bit of technicality to it\nand then a\nhuge road section so as we get into this\nmore technical spot all i'm trying to\nthink is\ni have to stay with this group to the\nroad and\nyou know again the whole time i'm just\nbike links off of people i don't really\nknow why\nother than i was just nervous maybe i'm\nnot really sure\ngetting over here now some guys it\nseemed like they didn't have the right\ngearing\nthis guy i know he kind of went off the\nside there but a lot of people\nthey were grinding up these little\npitches so my 34\n40 i was able to spin i was able to keep\nthe legs light i was able to\nnot have to put a ton of torque and slip\nbecause that's one of the biggest\nthings with the gravel is that you know\nif you have a lot of torque\nyou know you're just spinning your\nwheels so a lot of your energy and your\npower is going to\nrotating your wheel and not actually\nmoving forward\nso i'm doing the best i can to try to\nstay with this group\nwe're flying the dust was so\nbad you could you could like literally\nyou could see nothing i couldn't see\nwhat was happening i couldn't see what\nwas\ncoming up and so this often would have\nme sort of fall off a little bit just so\nthat i could see\nanything and also my glasses the\nvisibility\nwas was something i did i hadn't really\nexpected but my glasses sort of\nuh had this like coat of dust on it so\nthere was like really bad glare it's\nkind of insane\nbut we get to the road section this\ngroup is\nfull of some seriously strong diesel\ntype motors i mean they are\nrolling and so then i we pre-rode this i\nknew\nwhat to expect here i knew that we were\ncoming into a big road section\nso i could just sort of really not have\nto worry about\nburning any matches like i just stay on\nthis group and then i can recover\nfor a while which is what ended up\nhappening\nuh the group here sort of settled down\nthis was the easiest part of the race\nso what are we like almost four hours in\nbefore we really started\nsort of had a recovery period\nall right so we only have 35 miles left\nto go\nwe're four hours 23 minutes into this i\nthink i'm about top\n40 going into an another pretty\ntechnical gravel section\nand the trek rider and the stan's no two\nthat's the the leader of the the women's\ndivision\nthose two were so strong i mean they\nwere pushing the pace\nuh this trek guy was just like\nhands down the strongest in the group\nbut what was so crazy is\nyou know because i think it's so flat\nand there's a lot of wind\nuh it was really hard to get away from\nanyone i mean you could spend\nso much energy on the front and really\ndo no damage\nand so i'm trying to just stay with\nthese guys i popped another ketone\nyou know so i did 30 milligrams at the\nstart then i did another 30 milligrams\naround this point\nso i'm feeling really good you can see\nhere she's the leader of the the female\ndivision the women division and right\nthere she's like slipping and spinning\nand i saw a lot of people doing that um\nmaybe just not the right gearing or just\nbeing\nover twerked on some of these uh\nslippery climbs and\nnot that she doesn't know how to write\ngravel i'm just saying in general\nthere is a skill set to knowing how to\napply power\nto gravel roads and how to climb\nwhere you're not just using raw power or\ntorque and being really efficient\nso i got through there i got through\nthat section\nthere were some pretty difficult times\nbut\ni made it i'm so excited i'm so stoked\non where i am and how i'm feeling\nwe are headed into the hardest part of\nthe ride which is this big\nsandy climb everyone here is kind of\npace lining a little bit\neveryone's you know maybe 70\nin i mean we're wanting to catch as many\npeople as we can\nbut no one's really trying to completely\nempty the tank\nthere's a big road section and a bit of\na climb we had a tailwind section here\nand if everyone really wanted to empty\nthe tank i think we could have made up a\nlot of time here\nbut pretty much everyone wanted to just\nstay on wheels i know i did i wanted to\nsave as much as i could coming up to the\nmain\nclimb lucas he had crashed um\nand so he was out of the front group\nwhich is a bummer we're all kind of just\ngetting ready for the next and hardest\npart of the race\nall right so going into the big climb\nthe hardest section on this course\nuh we're about five hours in only 18\nmiles left i had to stop and get some\nuh some food and some fuel this was the\nfirst rest stop that i\nstopped at and velofix here he got me\ndownloaded with a bottle\nnow they made a change last minute that\nyou could have personal support\nwhich really made it for a lot of\nhitters or people who\nhad a lot of support out here to have\nquite an advantage\nbecause you didn't have to stop at the\nrest stops you had people all over the\nplace\nand and due to kova they just thought\nlike that's a better way to do it is to\nhave your own personal support than\neveryone\nhanging out at a rest stop um so for the\nmost part i\nbrought enough fuel with me to get me to\nthis point and so i hadn't had to use\nany public rest stops\num until that one and i grabbed like i\neight sis gels and i had that one bottle\nfrom velofix that he gave me\nand so the sis gels are really thin like\nthe viscosity is\nvery watery and so even though i didn't\nhave a ton of water at this point\num i could use those gels almost to\nhydrate myself as well\nbut this climb is so sandy it's so steep\nit was\nreally hot it was really strange to go\nfrom like 35 in the morning to right\nhere it felt like a thousand degrees\nand there's there's just no way you're\ngonna find\nsome big effort inside of you it's just\nmore about\nnot completely blowing up because\nthere's a couple sections on this where\nit's so\nsandy and so steep that you're having to\ndo four 500 watts just to stay upright\nand so you know if you are in the red\nand you get to a point where you can no\nlonger sustain that\nand if you unclipped and had to walk it\nwould be real\nyou could lose a minute you could lose\ntwo minutes you could lose so much time\nand just i guess mentally be so cracked\nso i just sort of held you know high\nzone three\nlow zone four feeling really good at\nthis climb\nuh knowing that what's coming next is a\nbig downhill and that single track\nand so this is it this is the final run\nin\nuh we're 14 miles left to go we've got\na good size downhill and then that crazy\nsingle track\nand so until this point i feel like my\ntire choice had been spot on like it was\nreally good it was super fast\nit was a little hard to control in some\npoints but ultimately i think it was the\nfastest setup\ncoming down into this section and\nespecially the single track\ni should have stopped and at the top and\nmaybe let some pressure out\ni think if i let some pressure out i\ncould have actually went\nfive minutes faster in this last section\njust because\nyou know of how it was really hard to\ncontrol this\nsandy section we i did that twice in our\npre-ride so i kind of knew a little bit\nabout this section\nalso at this point i was more afraid of\na mechanical\nso close to the finish than really\nimproving my position\nuh you know i mean i'm not gonna catch\nanyone in front\nit's just more about not losing any\npositions\nin the group that we're in and so we\nkind of had this group of\na few people you know not full gas\nracing but just kind of staying together\nlet's get to the single track together\nlet's go down these\nthese hills let's keep it safe and so\nyou know we're headed towards\nthat single track and uh\ni think we have maybe a group of like\nsix here and i can't see really anyone\nup the road so i have no idea\nyou know if we're even gonna catch\nanyone or not and again like i said\nright here\ni should have aired down if i had\ndropped 20 psi\nright here even though i feel like oh\ni'm gonna stop and i'm gonna lose all\nthis time\ni would have gained it would have been\nit would have been huge\nit would have been so much better\nbecause at least in the beginning\nit wasn't so bad but the end of this\nsingle track is\nso rocky and bumpy that\ni mean it was almost like i was on a\npogo stick i kept coming unclipped um\nit was almost impossible to control the\nbike i was getting really frustrated\nit was like i hit every single possible\nrock\nwhich was kind of a bummer and so then\nthe two guys in the blue and\nyellow and the stan's no tubes\nuh woman they kind of they were gone\num i was stuck behind this guy for a\nlittle bit he let me buy\nand i thought i was gonna catch those\nother people but again like i said the\n50 psi was\nnot good for this single track great for\neverything else not good here\nnow unfortunately my gopro dies uh i\ni had three batteries on me and somehow\nthey just\nall popped out it was really bump anyway\nlost my batteries\nand so i couldn't change my battery for\nthe fin the finish\ni don't have the finish on film\nwhich is super irritating um but so we\ncome out of the single track\nand there's about i have a group of like\nfour or five\nand it was really fast through like\nthese little\num walk paths and and bike paths and so\nhere's kind of the reenactment of the\nfinish is that we come\nin to the final sprint we've got lucas\non the front we've got\ni'm on the back of this group here and\nuh\nthis guy in the y he takes off he's\nsprinting i wish i had this on footage\nbecause i'm staying on his wheel\nand the last minute i actually out\nsprinted someone\ni won the pack sprint out of the group\nthat we were with then i did a wheelie\nand then i did a backflip and then i\nturned into a banana i have no footage\nof it but trust me it's what happened\nso my finish time was six hours 34\nminutes that's 39 minutes off of first\nuh the winner's time was five hours 55\nminutes\nwhich is honestly almost exactly\ni think i was 40 minutes off of first\nuh last year at belgian waffle so but i\ndid get\n26th overall sixth in my age group\nmy normalized power for the whole six\nhours 34 minutes was\n245 watts that's 3.5 watts per kilo\nnormalized\nthat's a lot uh energy wise i burned\n5000 calories\nyou know had a huge day on the bike and\nlook there's no vegan excuses because i\nrode to the best of my potential\ni only have vegan excuses when something\nhappens that stops me from\ndoing what i know i could have done my\npower\nmy energy my the way i rode physically\nwas about as the best i could have\nexpected\nand so i can't be down about that at all\nmy boy travis\nyou know he was drives all the way out\nhere this was a big event for him he was\nready for it he had trained for it\nand then he had no luck uh cole kessler\nalso super strong no luck i mean there\nwere so many people\nthat had so many issues and\ni didn't have any of those issues right\ni mean i had my own little issues\nbut nothing that stopped me from being\nthe best i could physically be and i\nknow i make a lot of excuses sometimes\nbut the thing is that i don't care if i\nget\nlast place if i get lapped a hundred\ntimes\nin a one mile crit if i did the best i\nknow i\nphysically could do that if i lived up\nto my potential\ni'm always going to be happy with that\nand so with\nhow much this trip cost and how much\ntime we put into it and how i was away\nfrom my family for so long\nthere was a lot of pressure to not\ncompletely suck\nand so to do better than i did last year\nso bwr i got 40th last year was one of\nmy most proudest results\nand then to get 26th here this year um\nto do well\ni am i'm just super proud of it man i'm\nsuper stoked on this\nand again maybe in the beginning i could\nhave done a little more to\nhave been further up the road\nbut if i was with that front group i\njust can't imagine\nthat i could have stayed with them given\nhow hard i had to ride\nfor 26th place the amount of support\nthat i got from\ncanyon from irc from elio\nuh was huge uh so i just want to say a\nhuge thank you to those guys\nand just the event you know michael\nmarks he puts on a phenomenal event\nthe belgian waffle like ethos is just\nyou know the hardest one day ride uh\never and it just lives up to that i mean\nthis course was phenomenal it was one of\nmy favorite courses i've ever ridden\nbecause there wasn't any huge um\nphysical deciders until the very end so\nyou could if you had some technical\nskills and you had some good base\nfitness\nyou could feel competitive all the way\ninto that last climb\nand so i thought it was a really fair\nand and like overall\ngood course can't wait to do it next\nyear guys i hope you enjoyed the video\num i'm really proud of this result if\nyou want to go back and watch the four\ndays leading up to this i\ndaily vlogged you know our little trip\nleading into this\nand as always guys vegan cyclists",

          "transcript": "what and earth is a gravel bike nobody\nreally knows do they although we think\nwe might because we've got a theory on\nthis we do a gravel bike is a modern\nretro mountain bike only better and to\nprove this we're gonna put our theory to\nthe test before we do that though we\nneed to take you on a journey we're\nactually gonna do that bit\n[Music]\nback in the mists of time mountain bikes\nwere cool they were the antidote to\nboring road bikes they allowed us to\nventure away from tarmac and onto the\ndirt in search of added thrills as\ntechnology evolved over the years so too\ndid mountain biking and now events like\nrampage or the fest series show just\nwhat's possible and the best thing is we\ncan all do it to Thor we can at least\ntry this is gonna be unlike anything\nyou've ever seen before as in worse and\nanything you've ever seen before\nwhat's it felt amazing how high was it\nit looked amazing it was probably about\nthree or four inches series three or\nfour it was rather radical top doing I'm\ngoing to do that again yeah probably the\nbest idea I match the problem really\nisn't it I mean we all want the best\nmost capable bikes perhaps a bike that's\nequally at home hiking cliffs in Utah's\nit is carving endless Alpine descents\nbut come on how many of us actually have\nthat sort of terrain on our doorsteps\nlet alone in fact the guts needed to do\nit no what happens is that mountain\nbikers typically get what we call\noverbite\nriding the same trails have been written\nfor the last 20 or 30 years but on bikes\nthat can now eat them for breakfast\nthere's no challenge it's like driving a\ntractor over a Twix we're isolated from\nany sort of thrill from these simple\ntrails basically they're just a bit\nboring\nyou heard boring modern mountain bikers\nare boring\nadmittedly not many of them would like\nto go back to 26 inch wheels and V\nbrakes but I think it's hard to deny\nthat those old mountain bikes made the\nkind of simple trails that we will\nactually ride an enormous amount of fun\nand they made them fun because the bikes\nweren't actually that good so simple\ntrails felt challenging however what\nthey were really good at was actually\npedaling cycling some people like to\ncall it I mean the handlebars are not\nstupidly wide but sensibly narrow and\nthey have bar ins attached and everyone\nknows they're just ace our van bearings\nare so aged especially for climbing or\ngetting Aero for the good bit that\nslender elegant construction is an\nindication of its lightweight mix is\njust over 10 kilos or 22 pounds and then\nyou also have those smaller diameter\nwheels couples to that steep head angle\nand short wheelbase I mean the whole\nbike just feel small and agile and\nlively\nsome people might even say they're\nsketchy no let's face it we're not\nactually launching ourselves over 30\nfoot gap goats here even though that was\npretty living close this is a bike for\nthe common people\nexactly so is it a coincidence then that\nit just about the time when normal on\nmountain bikes meant monster truck tires\nand 140 Miller suspension front and back\nthat a new trend began to emerge riding\nbikes that felt familiar on tarmac but\nyet can also go off-road as well riding\nall terrains even biking up mountains a\nbike that is fast but challenging light\nand responsive and small and agile and\nfunds are actually peddle and to get out\nthe saddle on a bit like this it's been\nsaid before but gravel bikes are a lot\nlike taking the best bit of retro\nmountain bikes and making them even\nbetter\nbut how similar are they and what do\nthey do better and what if anything do\nthey do worse well to find out as you\ncan see our mates that allow have got on\nboard with this project and very kindly\nsupplied a true grit frame set and grit\nSL suspension forks but sprayed up in an\nhomage to those killer mountain bikes\nfrom the early 90s\nin comparison we have a rally titanium\nwith full XTR groupset ridden to several\ntop 14 finishes by none other than\nDaniel Lloyd back in 1999 this you gotta\nsay was an advanced machine I mean no\nv-brakes here this has got hydraulic\nbrakes hydraulic rim brakes but still we\nalso have this edgy T's Aska which is a\ntrue icon of the 90s cross country\nmountain bike scene\nit comes with rock shock sid suspension\nbooks although it appears that the air\ngot left in the 90s and it's also got a\nnext year group set however this is the\npart that size going to be using another\npointed out to him he's only got xt\nshifters and mismatched brake levers to\nfind out just how similar they all are\nwe are firstly going to shred our\nmountain bikes and the gravel bike\nbefore unleashing something of a special\nedition something we're gonna call a\nhybrid yeah about that I'm not sure\nabout the word hybrid anyways why not\nwell the hybrid is not exactly the\ncoolest bikes around town are they know\nthey're now I take your point mutant\nmutant yeah I like it yes yeah well our\nmutant is basically like a grabber bike\nisn't it with wide flat bars and a\nslightly longer stem yeah so I mean\nthat's exactly what it is isn't it yeah\nour test track is the perfect mix of\ngravel climbing some tarmac some single\ntrack and of course some gnarly jumps we\nwill be getting rad over those it\nsquatted before Matt ride on each bike\nand compare the times Plus how each bike\nfeels okay now because GPS hadn't been\ninvented there when Dan was racing this\nand also because our Wahoo's won't\nactually fit on these microscopically\nthin handlebars I'm gonna use something\ncalled a stopwatch remember yeah\nstopwatch on a smartphone yes okay right\nlowly you ready mate I was like right\nyep you are looking good\nthree two one go\nwhoa\n[Applause]\nI must admit this bike is quite hard to\nhandle in this position I have got a\nanother mountain bike at home I've still\ngot the bars touch right down I don't\nhave bearings on it but it's a 29 now\nand you're just so much higher at the\nfront and it gives you a lot more\ncontrol so I love the bearings on the\nclimb I think I definitely choose a\ndifferent type of bike for those\ndescents there are me very very\ninterested to see how the gravel bike\nfeels down there compared to this one\nnow sighs modern mutant does have bars\nupon which you can fit a Wahoo element\nbolt as he gonna be timing himself but\njust to make sure he's not teasing I\nwill also be timing it on my smartphone\nare you ready sorry I am I'm bit nervous\nabout that massive jump that you've been\ngetting out I styled it over that I need\nit anyway\nhow's Megha it does feel very different\nstill to every man but it feels a lot\nlighter and like who take you a while to\nget you sites change super responsive\ncuz that stem and the flat bars combined\nmeans that you're a little bit shorter\nthan you were beyond drops that's a\ngenuine grin while we're cranking out\nsome hot laps let's dive in to a little\nbit more detail about the tech so we can\nactually try and get to the bottom of\nwhy we think these two genres of bikes\nare so similar if we start with the\nfirst point and we've touched on it\nalready\nboth retro mountain bikes and gravel\nbikes have been designed principally\nwith pedaling and actually riding in\nmind over just the ability to go\ndownhill really fast so the suspension\ntravel is perfect for taking the edge\noff things but you're not going to be\nable to swallow entire ruts whole and it\nalso means that the front end can be low\nenough you can get a really nice\ncomfortably stretched out and low\nposition on both these types of bikes\ndance retro manned by perhaps is taking\nthings to extremes in that he's actually\nmore Aero on that then he would be on a\ntime trial bike which means that both\nretro mountain bikes and gravel bikes\nare easier to ride faster and in more\ncomfort it's not just the position the\ngeometry is also remarkably similar in\nfact the chainstay links on the GT zas\ncar and both the loud gravel bikes are\nexactly the same and also the head tube\nangles and trail numbers are exactly the\nsame too\nlightweight was also a real priority for\nretro mountain bikes that they felt fast\nand lively and we're also able to climb\nreally efficiently and the same is true\nfor a modern gravel bike as well the\ndifference being now though is that\ntechnologies advance the extent that\nlittle off is 1.6 kilos lighter than our\nGT zas car and let's face it it's not\neven trying all that hard it's just that\ntechnology and materials have moved on\nit has a carbon fiber frame a carbon\nfiber fork carbon fiber cranks handle\nbus also slightly weirdly the tires are\nvery similar with so those green ones on\nmy rally mountain bike measure up at 46\nmillimeters in width whilst these WTB\nResolute's come in at 44 millimeters\nalthough obviously these wheels are\nbigger in diameter so they do roll a bit\nquicker also the tires like the rest of\nthe bike prioritize light weight and\ntherefore fast riding and again modern\ntechnology is a bit of a game changer\nwith these because they are tubeless\nthat allows you to run lower tire\npressures which in turn means more\ncomfort and more grip to bistec it's\njust the tip of the iceberg though\nreally the fact that this has a 1 by 12\nspeed electronic wireless drivetrain\nputs it in something of a different\nleague as well not just in the speed and\nthe smoothness of the shifting and the\nfact that it makes a really cool noise\nbut also actually in tech advancements\nthat we kind of now take for granted\nlike the clutch in the rear mech that\npretty much eliminates chain slap a bit\nlike this brakes which were somewhat of\na game-changer when they were introduced\nto mountain bikes probably about 20\nyears ago and the same can be said since\ntheir introduction onto drop bar by it's\na little bit more recently the question\nis then with all this technology and the\nfact that these laus have 20 years of\nyouth on their side versus the retro\nmountain bikes will they be faster all\nright lowly you ready mate yeah it does\nseem a bit of a shame to get such a\nbeautiful brand-new bike so much of six\nminutes yeah Cannings can clean him\npretty well mate if you're right okay\nall right you got your wacky one this\ntime so what off you go sorry me\nright are you ready I think so Matt I'm\nfeeling a bit of pressure to get some\nrad air over that lip there I don't\nthink your folks have very much pressure\nat all this lack of air in them anyway\nno don't go over the front of the\nhandlebars with you know on your marks\nget set\neven's folks got more air than heaters\nrecho man-boy first impressions probably\nnot a fair test given the state of the\nforks but that we said I've got how much\nfun man bikes have that ilk ah it's easy\nto think that they're outdated and don't\nwork but that is cool and also they'll\nbe said they're narrow ish handlebars\nand barns are utterly amazing and if I\nwas going to do one thing it would be to\nput slightly narrower bars on the mutant\nand slightly longer stem 130 more rules\nyeah funny how different our mutant bike\nand our true gravel bike feel and that I\nthink is entirely down to the fact that\nthe bars are narrower and the effective\nreach is longer meaning that it kind of\nslows the steering down ever so slightly\nso actually it feels a lot easier to\nhandle so this felt absolutely Bob on\nyeah today mutant gravel boy mutant\nlet's crunch some data right time to put\nour money where our mouths are Dan\nalthough before we say that we should\npoint out we have got cleaned up since\nour race runs we be completely\ntransparent admit that this is the day\nafter site we got very wet and very cold\nand we yeah we did but let's not let\nthat spoil a good story on the slide\ndeflated gt's a scar I did four minutes\nand 49 seconds and then on the drop\nhandlebar laughs true grit I did four\nminutes and five seconds and then on the\nmutant 4 minutes and 10 right quite a\ndifference then yeah well I sigh on my\nretro mountain bike did 3 minutes and 59\nsecond cause I'm joking actually on the\nrally retro mountain bike I did 5\nminutes and 11 seconds and remarkably I\nwas quicker on the Truvia I say\nremarkably\nwho's my legs felt like led after just\none fire effort on that first climb I\nstill nice to shave 21 seconds off for\nthis bike at 4 minutes and 50 seconds\nright so Dan mm-hmm so sorry how much\ntime do you think we lost from riding\nvintage mountain bikes that had been\nused for 20 odd years I didn't mean the\nfact that they're not brand spanking new\nyeah I don't think I would have lost\nthat much mainly does it fact that I've\nwell-maintained my bike over the last 25\nyears or so site and including pumping\nair into the fork\nwell yes basic maintenance I guess now\none thing that is very clear from this\nand that is that the mutant is not quite\nthe perfect hybrid of retro mountain\nbike and modern gravel bike that I\nthought it might be amazing fun\nnevertheless but perhaps I shouldn't\nhave come as a surprise when you put\nflat handlebars on a bike well it's been\nperfected to be used with drop\nhandlebars it kind of just this is a\nlittle something that's just not quite\nright which is the same actually because\nit looks great than that it does look\namazing and the other thing down is I\nreally missed my bearings on there\nhaving spent a bit more time on this now\nany time you're climbing or riding fast\nflat stuff you just really crave yeah\nsome basically some breakfast I've been\nsaying this for years\nbring back bearings to mountain by to\nstart petition yeah alright before we\nfinish this video sorry there is one\nthing about both these bikes that we\nhaven't even told our viewers about yeah\nwell that is the fact that they both\nhave an integrated beer bottle opener\nyeah where the filter Adia used to go\nand so in the interim between\nyesterday's bro riding and today I've\nbought some beers\ngood lad Dan excellent advanced you've\nwon by that's not often talked about is\nit but there we go and I suppose it\nwashed your easy mate washed your\nopening I've won yet honestly yeah well\nyou're opening our bottles of beer I\nthink we should probably try and address\nthat initial question shouldn't we and\nthat is that so\nwe should probably turn in address that\nand it's a question of whether gravel\nbytes are related to retro mountain\nbikes and I think in spirit yes but it's\nnot quite brother and sister in it it's\nkind of more like cousins I suppose I\nmean they are designed to be used on\ngravel and tarmac as well as being good\noff-road whereas retro matter bikes were\ndesigned principally for off-road minute\nwell I would agree with that\nyeah and I would like to clarify one\nthing that we said earlier sorry you\nknow and we said that mountain bikes are\nboring yeah we didn't really mean it\nyeah we did not some bikers mainly you\nknow the people but now I'm tetramine\nthat Eva and what we artem say is that\nthose modern mountain bikes might not be\nthe most fun on the trails that you have\nany doorstep that's particularly apt for\nme living down the new forest and that\nis where these gravel alternatives\nreally come into play that's right it is\nas we said earlier like a bike flip for\nnormal life isn't it I see with that\nyeah Yeah right cheers mate chief well\ndon't drink it is not going free after\nthat one as well okay all right well\nthen well Dan drinks his beers I will\nsay please this video a big thumbs up if\nyou've enjoyed it I hope you've enjoyed\nit half as much as we have and also let\nme point the direction of another\ncracking video where Olli got to use one\nof these laughs true grits in its\nnatural habitat in the volcanoes of\nIceland's Highlands I've got about a\ndiet coke if you want it not really",
