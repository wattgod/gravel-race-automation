Peter L's power data shows the TT takes ~20 minutes while Saturday requires 2+ hours of sustained effort. The format allows single-stage entries for riders not wanting the full omnium commitment. Similar distance to Crusher in the Tushar."

Similar technical demands to Gravel Worlds."

Similar elevation profile to Gravel Worlds."

Peter L experienced the 2024 reality: \"This weekend was the 3-day montana gravel challenge, and it's raining.\" He dressed \"for cold and rain which was forecast but didn't really happen,\" then faced muddy sections that \"has only gotten worse over the last few days of periodic rain and cool temps.\" More weather exposure than Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

Peter L's power numbers (338w average, 361w normalized for the TT) suggest the altitude impact is manageable for most riders. The elevation affects pacing more through the rolling terrain profile than thin air, based on his race experience data. Similar altitude considerations to Grinduro."

      "adventure": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Course routing adapts to conditions, with organizers shortening the TT and skipping dangerous gravel sections when weather deteriorates. Peter L describes Sunday's mud climb as \"a section I cut out of the TT on friday morning because it was a little iffy.\" The three-day format across Montana's variable spring conditions creates unpredictable challenges."

The Cycling House and Competitive Timing provide professional organization but not national-level competition."

Peter L calls Sunday the \"road race\" stage. Professional timing by Competitive Timing and proper course marking provide solid race infrastructure, but the surface breakdown doesn't match typical gravel race expectations."
      },

Peter L tracked his recovery: \"yesterday morning I felt like garbage and my watch told me my 'training readiness' was 14. This morning it said 7 but I felt better.\" Weather variability and course changes keep riders adapting, though significant pavement mileage dilutes the pure gravel experience most seek."

Peter L's race reports focus on small group tactics and local age group battles rather than deep fields. The $40-150 price range and same-day registration availability point to accessibility over exclusivity. Thinner field than Ouray Gravel Grinder.

Peter L ran 34mm tires at 42-46 psi on his Orbea Terra with road wheels, noting \"The bike, wheel, and tire setup was perfect all weekend.\" Late April timing avoids peak Montana tourism pricing while maintaining access to Missoula's amenities.
