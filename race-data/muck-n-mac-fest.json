No historical weather data available, but organizers clearly design around wet Scottish spring conditions."

Lorna M loved the \"wonderful chilled and friendly atmosphere\" at this historic venue."

Angela L praised \"fantastic scenery and a great mixture of trails\" with good camping amenities, though aid stations scored lower at 3.87/5."
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "87% of reviewers describe the atmosphere as \"Small & Intimate\" rather than large festival scale. Bob G \"LOVED the ceilidh\" and praised the \"lovely people\" in the 400-rider field. Free entry for kids under 14 with bike activities creates family appeal, but the community remains small and regionally focused."
