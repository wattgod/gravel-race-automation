No pro field mentioned, no notable winners in the research dump, just a small Scottish Borders festival trying to find its identity. 400 total riders across all formats isn't exactly drawing the cycling world's attention."

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "They're still figuring out what they want to be—gravel enduro with timed stages one day, challenge format the next. New format every year screams experimentation, not refinement. The course runs through Traquair House grounds with some woodland trails, but no specific technical features or signature climbs mentioned."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Lexi Ligeti says it's 'extremely well organised' with activities for everyone, but that's one testimonial from what appears to be a small field. Free camping and access to the maze sounds quaint, but the racing itself seems secondary to the festival vibes. Weekend format spreads thin across multiple short days rather than one defining challenge."
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Family-friendly with kids under 14 free and adaptive cyclist inclusion shows good intentions. Live music Saturday night and yoga talks appeal to the wellness crowd, but 400 riders across all weekend options isn't exactly a thriving scene. Still building community rather than established tradition."
      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Border.200 caps at 200 riders, weekend options split the remaining field across multiple formats. No mention of competitive categories, timing, or any racers worth knowing about. This is participation-medal territory where finishing is the achievement."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "£72-80 for the Border.200 with free camping is reasonable for a weekend in Scotland. Full weekend packages at £110-125 include multiple ride days, camping, and festival access. You're paying for the experience package, not just bike racing, which works if that's what you want."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Scottish Borders location means travel costs unless you're local. Camping is included but food and extras add up at festival prices. No airport or accommodation details provided, so you're figuring logistics yourself. Budget-friendly if you can drive and camp, pricier if you need real lodging."
      },
      "length": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Border.200's 200km is respectable distance, but weekend options split into 75km and 45km per day—bite-sized chunks that don't test much. Multiple short days with breaks between doesn't create the same suffering as one sustained effort. Length without commitment."
      },
      "technicality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Described as gravel enduro through woodland trails around Traquair House, but no specific technical features mentioned. Lady Louisa's walk past Quair water sounds more scenic than challenging. If it welcomes adaptive cyclists, the technical bar isn't set particularly high."
      },
      "elevation": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "No elevation gain specified anywhere in the research, which tells you it's probably not the selling point. Scottish Borders has hills but this seems focused on flowing trails rather than brutal climbs. The name implies mud, not mountains."
      },
      "climate": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "May in Scotland is a gamble—could be brilliant, could be miserable. The name 'Muck n Mac' suggests they expect mud and rain gear weather. No historical weather data provided, but if you're planning for muck, you know what you're getting into."
      },
      "altitude": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Scottish Borders isn't exactly high country. Traquair House sits in a river valley, and nothing suggests significant elevation. You're not dealing with altitude effects here, just rolling hills and woodland trails."
      },
      "logistics": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Free camping on-site solves accommodation, but no airport, parking, or packet pickup details provided. You're left figuring out how to actually get there and what happens when you arrive. For a fifth-year event, the logistical information is surprisingly thin."
      },
      "adventure": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Riding through historic Traquair House grounds with maze access and riverside trails has legitimate charm. Scotland's Borders region delivers scenic variety even if not technical challenge. The festival format with sauna, music, and camping creates more adventure than just showing up to race and leave."
