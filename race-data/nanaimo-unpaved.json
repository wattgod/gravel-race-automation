Getting to Vancouver Island still requires ferry planning or island flights, but the motocross venue provides established parking and facilities."

It's the middle ground that avoids both quick morning efforts and all-day epics. More compact than Grinduro."
      },
      "technicality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "The course runs on Mosaic Forest Management's private gravel roads, accessing terrain normally closed to the public, plus incorporates sections of the Nanaimo Motocross Association track. Two DNFs out of 32 starters in the 2025 Impulso suggests manageable but selective technical demands. Less technical than The Mid South."

      "elevation": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "3,500 feet over 50 miles averages 70 feet per mile of climbing - steady undulation rather than defining ascents. The private Mosaic Forest Management roads likely provide consistent grades through managed timber terrain, but without major summit objectives. Less climbing than The Mid South."
      },
      "climate": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "June 15 timing hits Vancouver Island's pre-summer sweet spot, and the low DNF rate (2 out of 32 riders in 2025) suggests conditions were manageable. The motocross venue provides some weather shelter, but coastal conditions remain unpredictable. More weather exposure than Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."
      },
      "altitude": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "This is Vancouver Island coastal terrain starting near sea level. No altitude considerations whatsoever - you're racing in coastal forest management roads that barely register elevation above the Strait of Georgia. Lower altitude than Gravel Worlds — no thin-air concerns."
      },
      "adventure": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Vancouver Island offers adventure potential with its coastal terrain and forest roads, but this event provides zero specifics about what you'll actually encounter. The Trek series positioning as 'world's best gravel destination' is marketing hyperbole without course details to back it up. Real adventure requires unknowns, but these are the wrong kind of unknowns."
      },
      "prestige": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "This is the finale event of a 3-race Vancouver Island series that includes Campbell River and Duncan, with Trek backing and local sponsors. Winners like Justin Filuk and Fabian Merino indicate regional competitive depth, but it's not drawing international attention."
      },
      "race_quality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "The 2025 edition drew 129 riders across three distances with proper wave starts, rider briefings, and professional photography by Jay Wallace. Post-race food trucks run 11 AM-3 PM with awards at 3 PM, showing solid event execution within the Trek BC Gravel Series framework."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "The motocross venue provides a distinctive racing atmosphere, and the private forest roads offer exclusive terrain access. Food trucks and drinks create a 4-hour post-race festival window, while the series finale positioning adds ceremonial weight to the day."
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Strong masters participation includes competitive 65+ riders like 68-year-old Barbara Morris placing 5th overall in her category. The series draws families - 13-year-old Tessa Thibault and 15-year-old Tycho Thibault both completed the 40km distance, indicating multi-generational appeal."
      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "129 total riders across three distances shows healthy participation, but the winning margins are significant - Mark Wiebe finished just 56 seconds behind Justin Filuk, while third place Carl Foght was over 5 minutes back. Regional depth without traveling competitive talent. Thinner field than Ouray Gravel Grinder."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Registration fees aren't listed, but camping is included and it's part of a series with Trek backing, suggesting reasonable pricing. Three distance options mean you're not overpaying for more race than you need. Vancouver Island location delivers scenery and terrain value, and new events typically underprice to build their field."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Registration runs $75-100 CAD. Vancouver Island access requires ferry costs from mainland BC or island flights, plus Canadian pricing throughout. The established motocross venue keeps logistics straightforward, and Nanaimo offers more lodging options than smaller island communities. Higher total cost than Badlands."
