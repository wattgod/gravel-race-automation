        "score": 2,

      "altitude": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "The Trace runs mostly on ridges rather than valley floors, but Nashville sits around 500 feet above sea level.

      "experience": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "The Natchez Trace offers controlled access roads without commercial chaos, letting riders focus on the historical route. However, the \"trainer\"-like repetitive terrain of rolling hills through identical tree corridors limits scenic variety compared to more dramatic cycling destinations."
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Active cycling community discusses the area with specific route knowledge - hammydad recommends \"backroads surrounding the Trace (particularly Natchez Trace Rd and Liepers Creek Rd)\" with detailed connector information. Local shops survive despite premium pricing, indicating dedicated cyclist base."
      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "The aerobars-friendly terrain attracts time trial and triathlon training rather than technical gravel racing talent.

      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Registration runs $60-100. Nashville costs stay moderate compared to coastal markets, though local cycling services command premium pricing. The Gran Fondo shop reputation for being \"the only bike shop that can survive even when they sell over retail price\" suggests cyclists accept higher costs for quality service. Similar expense level to Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

          "transcript": "Hey there, my name is Ryan Van Doozer\nand my two-wheel journeys are typically\non dirt roads or single track in remote\nareas. I love experiencing the peace and\nquiet of distant places and I feel safer\nwhen I'm far away from speeding\nvehicles.\nBut I'm making an exception for this\nadventure. [music]\nthe 444 mile Nachas Trace from Natchas,\nMississippi [music] to Nashville,\nTennessee. I've read that this scenic\nbyway is safer for cyclists because it's\nclosed to commercial traffic and cars\naren't supposed to go faster than 50 m\nan hour. I'm also intrigued by the\nhistory of this [music] ancient route.\nFor more than 10,000 years, American\nIndians traveled and traded along this\n[music] corridor, which traverses the\nhomelands of the Nachez, Chasaw, and\nChakah nations. Civil war battles\noccurred in and around this area.\n[music]\nAnd during the peak of the slave trade,\nenslaved people were forced to travel\ndown the old [music] trace to a large\nslave market in Natchez.\nThis area of the United States is new to\nme and I'm looking [music] forward to\ngetting to know the people and culture\nof the deep south. It's a different\nworld from the foothills of the Rocky\n[music] Mountains where I'm from. As\nalways, traveling at a slower pace\nallows me the time and opportunity to\nmeet wonderful [music] people. These\nmoments of connection have a profound\nimpact on me and my understanding of the\nworld. So, here we go. [music]\n444 miles of continuous pavement. No\ntraffic lights, no [music] stop signs,\njust a smooth country road winding\nthrough beautiful forest, farmland, and\n[music] thousands of years of history.\nI usually ride a mountain bike on my\n[music] adventures, but for this one,\nI'm going for something a little\nspeedier. The Priority Gemini. Oh, and\none more thing. If my videos bring value\nto your life, please consider joining my\nPatreon. For as little as five bucks a\nmonth, you'll get early release videos\nwith no ads, [music]\naccess to ask me anything about\nanything, and monthly Zoom hangouts.\nThis is the first video in a short\nseries, so stay tuned until I reach\nRocky Top, Tennessee.\nWhy hello there. It's crazy how fast\nthings can change in just a short amount\nof time. I woke up in Boulder today and\nnow I am at the banks of the Mississippi\nin a town called Nachez. I planned this\ntrip just 3 days ago. I'm feeling really\ngrateful to be here, to have this\nopportunity to just up and get on my\nbike and and ride for a week. I don't\ntake this freedom for granted.\nAnd I've already met wonderful people.\nSo, let's go back a little bit. I landed\nand I had already pre-ooked a shuttle\nwith this guy named Rev. And he picked\nme up. And the moment he picked me up, I\nfelt like we'd been buddies for a long\ntime. I've only been in the car for\nabout 10 minutes. Rev is telling me all\nsorts of history. And I pointed at this\nfield and I said, \"Is that cotton?\" He's\nlike, \"Yes, [clears throat] it is.\"\nBoom. Turns off the side of the road and\nuh now we're checking out a cotton\nfield. Is the mic on, too?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the mic's on, man. Your your audio\nis recorded, buddy.\n&gt;&gt; This is Rails Country Tours in in\nbeautiful Mississippi, Southwest\nMississippi. We're in Raymond,\nMississippi. And this is the Battle of\nRaymond. And you'll look at all these\ncannons uh along this battlefield. These\nare all Union cannons. And when Grant uh\nsieged uh Vixsburg, he crossed at a\nplace um um just I guess about 30 mi\nsouth of here. And his first conquest\nbefore Vixsburg, he came to Raymond and\nburned it down. He went to Jackson,\nburned it down, and then came back down\nto Vixsburg for the most popular battle,\nwhich really ends the wars, the siege of\nVixsburg. And so this was a significant\nbattle was the first battle in the state\nof Mississippi. This cotton ain't new to\nthis place, is it? This you're talking,\nI mean, from from 18, let's say, 20 or\nso all the way up to 1865,\nall of this stuff is worked by enslaved\npeople. Um, slavery in doesn't really\nbegin in the south anyway. It starts in\nthe east coast with in the Virginia and\nCarolas in the tobacco plantations. So,\nslaves are actually migrated or force\nmigrated into the south from the from\nthe northeast. Uh, and that happens at\nthe turn of the century. At the same\ntime, uh, northern wealthy northerners\nare flocking down here, man, to make\ntheir fortunes grow in cotton. These\npeople know if they can get into the\ndeep south and acquire land and slaves,\nbarring misfortune, they're going to\nbecome wealthier. So, the great cotton\nkingdom is actually funded by the north.\nI'm a pastor and pastors are teachers.\nAnd so, um, if you remember the cartoons\nwhen you were a little boy and you know\nthe little light bulb would pop off in\nsomebody's head when they got it. I love\nwatching the light pop off. It's my joy\nto make your life pop off. [laughter]\n&gt;&gt; And so, you know, I I I do this to make\na living, but I do it also because I\nthink we need to um encourage one\nanother and to engage with one another.\nThere's so much partisanship, so much\nhatred in the world. Um Saturday there\nwas 16 shootings in Mississippi at\nsports events, college and high school\nsports events, and six people were\nkilled. And um you know I want to combat\nthe hatred that causes the death amongst\nus. And oddly enough, you know, we all\nindividuals, but none of us live in a\nvacuum and we need each other um to grow\nand to survive and and so hopefully if I\ncan help somebody to understand history\nand understand themselves and why they\nreact and feel the way they do, it'll\nchange their lives for the better. I I\nget this because I take kids on tours\nand and I give people who have never\nseen cotton before\n&gt;&gt; and um I like to give it away and you\nknow and\n&gt;&gt; I guess give a more of a visual kind of\na perspective to what what the south is.\nSo my goal for the next week or so, I'm\nplanning on maybe 75ish miles a day for\n6 days to get this done. My goal is to\nmeet more amazing people like Rev. You\nknow, my favorite part of bike touring.\nOne of my favorite parts is connecting\nwith great humans and that's definitely\none of my goals. And I want to see some\nbeautiful things and sleep under the\nstars and camp and just have some alone\ntime to think about life and you know\nall the good stuff that happens when you\nride your bike all day. So, I am going\nto go to my bed and breakfast now\nbecause I am tired and I'm going to wake\nup tomorrow and start riding my bike.\nAnd welcome to my very cozy bed and\nbreakfast. I don't know if I've ever\nstayed in a bed and breakfast. That's\npretty fancy for a guy like me. Looks\nlike I get to serve the breakfast at\nthis bed and breakfast. Yeah, get that\nyummy food, buddy. And this is the\ndownstairs. I feel like I'm in a palace.\nI feel like it's too nice to touch\nanything. I feel like I'm going to ruin\nsomething. But they do say make yourself\nat home. And this is my man Cliff here\ngetting the breakfast ready. How you\ndoing, brother?\n&gt;&gt; Doing good, brother.\n&gt;&gt; And there's my homecooked eggs and\ntoast.\n&gt;&gt; Cliff, thank you so much for taking good\ncare of me, my friend.\n&gt;&gt; You're so welcome, my brother. We're\nglad you stayed.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely. This place is\nincredible. It is beautiful place.\n&gt;&gt; Here's my bike. I am riding the Priority\nGemini.\nAnd this one is fancy. It has the\n[music] electronic pinion smart shift.\nOh yeah, there's my BNB, the Bowmont\nhouse. So Nachas is really well known\nfor these antibellum homes. That means\npre-war.\nAnd these beautiful homes are all over\nthe streets of this beautiful little\ntown.\nIt is a beautiful morning here. Perfect\ntemperatures. It's going to be like 85°\ntoday. It's going to feel like\nsummertime for this Colorado boy. Even\nthough it's mid October. I'm so excited\nto be here. So grateful. Yes. Here we\ngo. No crashies, no flatties, and\nespecially no whammies.\n&gt;&gt; What's up, Shadow? How we doing? Let's\ngo have some fun.\nAnd here we go.\nHere's the beginning of the Nachas\nTrace. And since I'm riding on a road\nsharing with vehicles, I'm going to try\nto be as visible as possible. Even\nthough there's really not supposed to be\na whole lot of traffic on this road. No\ncommercial traffic and cars aren't\nsupposed to go over 50. We will find\nout.\nNashville [music]\n449. Let's do it.\nAh, it feels so good to be pedaling my\nbike, especially knowing that all I have\nto do for the next 6 days is pedal my\nbike and enjoy nature and meet wonderful\npeople\nand discover new things and have the\ntime of my life. That's a pretty good\ndeal and it's extra special to be able\nto share it with you.\nAnother thing that I really value when I\nget to ride my bike on trips like this\nis the opportunity\nto just sit and think all day long.\nPeople ask me, \"Don't you get bored on\nyour rides? Do you listen to music?\"\nNope. I listen to nature and the birds\nand the wind blowing through the leaves.\n&gt;&gt; [snorts]\n&gt;&gt; And it gives me an opportunity just to\nunplug from the world and devices\nand dream. I think up some of my best\nthoughts and dreams while I'm on my bike\nand then I go home and I take action and\nstart making things come true. I also\nreminisce about the good old times in\nlife. You know, Christmases and\nHalloweens and family time.\nIt's just a great time to think, you\nknow, and we live in a world where we're\ndistracted a lot of the time. So,\nwhen I'm not distracted, just sitting on\nmy bike, [panting]\nit's like a gift to myself.\nAnd the older I get, the more I\nappreciate it.\nAnd I get to be out here connecting to\nnature, connecting to myself, my heart,\nconnecting to the wonderful strangers\nwhom I haven't met yet.\nAnd that's all really good stuff. That's\nsome of the best stuff in life I've I've\nrealized.\nAnd I enjoy the opportunity to challenge\nmyself. You know, riding a bike all day\nis fun, but it can be hard and there are\nups and downs throughout the day and I\nhave to mentally get myself through\nthem. Maybe there's bad weather or it's\nsuper hot or there's a lot of mountains,\nwhatever it is. And I really get to push\nmyself both mentally and physically.\nAnd when I do that, it's like training\nfor everyday life. I know that I can get\nthrough hard times and so it better\nprepares me for the ups and downs of\nlife.\nOh, here we go. Holy ole.\nShort [music] and sweet.\nCan you tell I'm having fun already?\nI've only gone 5 miles and I'm loving\nit.\n&gt;&gt; [music]\n&gt;&gt; Another cool thing about the trace is\nthat it's run by the National Park\nService, which means there are\nhistorical markers and information all\nover the place. Across the parkway\nbehind you is a portion of the old\nNachis Trace, a wilderness road that\noriginated from a series of trails used\nby the southeastern Indian tribes. The\nNachas Trace was politically,\neconomically, socially, and militarily\nimportant for the United States in its\nearly development. Among those that\ntraveled this road were American\nIndians, traders, soldiers, postriters,\nsettlers, slaves, circuit riding\npreachers, outlaws, and adventurers.\nHey, that's me. The old Nachez trace\nserves as a reminder of those who\ncontributed to events that shaped the\nbroad patterns of our common history.\nHere's\nsome more interesting information.\nThis is called Lois Bluff. This bluff\nshows a deep deposit of windb blown top\nsoil known as Lois. It was formed during\nthe ice age when glaciers covered the\nnorthern half of the United States. At\nthis time, nearly continuous dust storms\nswept in from the western plains and\ncovered this area up to 30 to 90 ft\ndeep.\nLucky number 13.\nbathrooms and rest areas all along the\nroute. This is the first one I've seen.\nI'm about 20 miles in. There is a\ngovernment shutdown right now and I\ndon't know how that's going to affect\nthe trace today, but it looks like it's\nopen.\nHey, look at that. Let's see if there's\nwater. That'd be handy. Oh, yeah. Nice.\nWell, this is cool. I'm not used to\nhaving bathrooms on my remote\nadventures. Usually, I just go out into\nthe woods. And it looks like there's\nalso\na stand\nwith tools to\nrepair\nyour bicycle. That is so cool.\n&gt;&gt; I am stopping here at mile 34\nfor a snack. You know what I'm saying?\nTime to eat. And I'm going to reach into\nmy bag of goodies. Trick or treat.\nI'll take it.\nAnd it's so quiet.\nI love it.\nHoly,\nholy, hol.\nOkay, we've got another historical\nmarker. The sunken trace. Preserved here\nis a portion of the deeply eroded or\nsunken old trace. Hardships of\njourneying on the old trace included\nheat, mosquitoes, poor food, hard beds,\nif any, disease, swollen rivers, and\nsucking swamps. Take 5 minutes to walk\nthis sunken trail and let your\nimagination carry you back to the early\n1800s when people walking 500 miles had\nto put up with these discomforts and\nwhere a broken leg or arm could spell\ndeath for the lone traveler.\nSo dramatic.\nI didn't think I'd be able to actually\nget into the old trace.\nAnd uh it seems like this is probably\nexactly what it looked like back in the\nearly 1800s. I just realized that I\nstill have my helmet on. But hey, safety\nfirst, right? You never know. I could\ntrip and fall. And yes, I am one of\nthose guys who when I ride around town\nin Boulder and go to the grocery store\nor something, I usually just keep my\nhelmet on because I it's just\ncomfortable. I don't want to take it\noff. You know what I'm saying? Are you\none of those people? Are you one of\nthose helmet dorks?\nAll right.\nAnd for my next snack, string cheese. M.\nI just stopped back there at Rocky\nSprings, but the bathrooms were closed.\nNo water for me. And I really wanted\nsome more water. I still have a bottle\nleft, but I always like to have extras\njust in case, especially in an area like\nthis, which is very hot. So, I think up\nhere on my map, it says something about\na country store off the route. So,\nhere we go. There's my country store.\nThat's about as country as a country\nstore could look.\nNice. So, I just walked into this\ncountry store. It is air conditioned. It\nis cool. It is perfect. And my new\nfriend Margaret here is making me some\ngrilled cheese. Thank you so much. And\nmy other buddy right here.\n&gt;&gt; How you doing?\n&gt;&gt; What's your name?\n&gt;&gt; Randy.\n&gt;&gt; Randy. Yeah. And this place just has a\ngreat vibe. And so there's live music\nevery weekend\n&gt;&gt; or\n&gt;&gt; pretty much. Well, a lot of times they\ndo it on Thursday nights.\n&gt;&gt; Okay. uh Friday nights, then Saturdays\nduring the day, he'll do one every once\nin a while and they'll get outside out\nthere where the little tent is. They'll\ndo one out there.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they somebody's pretty much out\nhere almost every day picking or doing\nsomething.\n&gt;&gt; How many people live in this little\ncommunity?\n&gt;&gt; During the Civil War,\n&gt;&gt; couple hundred, something like that.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. How long has this store been here?\n&gt;&gt; The original store was said to have been\nbuilt in 1851.\n&gt;&gt; How long have you been part of it? I've\nbeen here [music] four years.\n&gt;&gt; Four years.\n&gt;&gt; Cool.\n&gt;&gt; I love the people.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; What are the people I mean, the people\nI've met in this area are all super\nfriendly. I mean, southern hospitality\nreally is a thing.\n&gt;&gt; Honest to God, Mississippi is not what\nit seems.\n&gt;&gt; Mississippi is much better than they say\nwe are.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; In what way? What does that mean?\n&gt;&gt; We are not as racist as the rest of the\ncountry say we are. The blacks and\nwhites in our area get along perfectly.\n&gt;&gt; I love it.\n&gt;&gt; We're a rich\ncultured community and we all get along.\nWe all love each other.\n&gt;&gt; Everybody out here each other.\n&gt;&gt; I love that.\n&gt;&gt; You know, everybody out here.\n&gt;&gt; They you no matter who you are, one\nphone call and somebody's on their way\nto help you out.\n&gt;&gt; I mean, it just that's what we do out\nhere.\n&gt;&gt; And why do you think Southern\nHospitality is so such a big part of\nyour culture?\nI'm not sure. But to me,\nit's my belief in the Lord and the way I\nwas raised with Jesus\n&gt;&gt; and most of us around here were.\n&gt;&gt; So,\n&gt;&gt; so you treat people with respect and\n&gt;&gt; with respect the same way I want\neverybody to treat me.\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; yeah. Look at those grilled cheese\ncoming off the grill. Looking good.\n&gt;&gt; Oh, yes. Homemade. I love it.\nWell, thank you both so much. I'm really\ngrateful that I stopped here to say hi\nto you guys.\n&gt;&gt; Very well.\n&gt;&gt; There it is. The Crossroads Country\nStore right at about mile 59 of the\nNatchez Trace. If you want good food and\namazing people and hospitality, this is\nthe spot. I am so glad that it decided\nto to give it a shot cuz sometimes, you\nknow, you see something on the map and\nyou ride out of your way to go there and\nthen it's closed or something, you know?\nSo, but right when I walked into the\ndoor, they were just so incredibly warm\nand friendly and let me film. You know,\nnot everybody's comfortable with that,\nbut they were like, \"Yep, go right\nahead.\" This is the kind of place where\nI would love to hang out like at night\ntime when everybody's on the porch\ndrinking beers, having fun, sharing\nstories.\nAll right, we are back on the trace\nheading north. 41 miles from Jackson.\nThat's where I flew in yesterday.\nOle.\nWhenever I meet good people, it charges\nme up. It really does. Like that just\nmakes me feel more connected\nto this place, this community, to\nhumanity\nat large.\nAnd it just gives me hope for humanity.\nYou know, you watch the news and you see\nscary things all the time and bad people\ndoing mean things. And then you go into\na little country store in Mississippi\nand just talk to real people face to\nface, human to human.\nAnd it helps you realize there's way,\nway more good people out there than bad\npeople.\nOle. Olay. Olay.\nCheck out that beautiful golden\nsunlight.\nIt's getting lower on the horizon. It's\nabout 5:00 p.m. I've ridden 80 miles.\nFeeling good about that. Now I'm going\nto try to find a place to camp. And\nthere's nothing on my map for real\nlegitimate campsites anytime soon. So, I\nmight go find a place to hide in the\nwoods.\nOkay, I've been looking left and right\nfor a clearing and this looks pretty\ngood. Looks pretty promising in here.\nYou know, go hide myself. It's not that\nI really need to hide. I don't think\nanybody would really care, but you know,\nthere's nice peace of mind knowing that\nI'm safe and tucked in the forest.\nLet's see here. There might be a flat\nspot with some grass on it. Make it a\nlittle softer. Yeah, I think I'm done\nfor the day. What an amazing day. Let's\nget set up.\n&gt;&gt; Just like that. Lickickety lickety. All\nright, there's my setup. My quilt, my\nsleeping pad, and my new pillow, which I\nreally love. It's mainly just a place\nfor me to drool on at night, but I also\nlike the support. And I'm not gonna put\nthe rainfly on because\nit's still pretty hot and sticky and I\ndon't think it's going to rain tonight.\nSo, I'm gonna have a little bit of fresh\nair. I love that fresh air.\nI'm pretty happy with this spot. I\ndidn't know what I would find because\nsome of the road is like really dense\nforest and it would be hard to find flat\nground, but then I found this spot which\nis awesome. Obviously,\nthere's still some traffic driving by.\nThere's way more traffic here than I'd\nseen all day long. And I think it's\nbecause I'm close to Jackson. It's also\nevening, so I'm guessing there's some\ncommuters on the road, so I might have\nto deal with some, you know, traffic\nnoise.\nThere goes a truck.\nBut that's okay. You know, what an\namazing\nday. you know, I didn't quite know what\nI was getting myself into. You know, I'd\nheard about the Notch Trace for many\nyears, and it's kind of a legend in the\nbike touring world. And, you know, day\none definitely lived up to it. And I'd\nhave to say the highlight of my day, and\nyou probably already know it, was\nmeeting those wonderful people at the\ncountry store. That just made my heart\nfeel good. You know, when you connect\nwith good humans.\nSo, it's like 5:45 p.m.\nI'm not quite sure what to do with\nmyself. [laughter]\nMaybe I'll just lay in my tent and look\nat the trees right here. Yeah, look at\nthose trees.\nAnd just reminisce about a good day. I\ndon't bring books on my rides. I don't\nreally listen to music. Sometimes I do\nnighttime. Sometimes I listen to\npodcasts. But I really take these trips\nas a time to completely just disconnect.\nExcept for this camera that I'm holding\nright now.\nOo, you hear that? Of course you do. The\ncars have all calmed down and now it's\njust the bugs singing their night song.\nAnd I love it. It's going to be fun to\nsleep to this. Today was great. You\nknow, it was probably the easiest 88\nmiles I've ever ridden. It's just nice\nterrain, no big hills, no headwinds,\nyou know, the trees block all the the\nsun for the most part. There's no\ntraffic lights. There's no navigation\nreally. You know, you just get on the\ntrace and you ride north. So, it was\nvery smooth. A very good day number one.\nUh, I'm going to sleep well tonight.\nBoy, nice.\nOh, and there he is.\n&gt;&gt; Boy, my man from around here.\n&gt;&gt; Good to see you, brother. How are you,\nman?\n&gt;&gt; And I like that you wore your shirt so\nwe know where you're from.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. Alabama, baby.",

at the event we\nopted for the soft Landing that is Lodge\nDrew what's going on here\nI'm on vacation\nthis is why we Lodge\nit's cold we didn't sleep well Drew's on\na borrowed bike\nwhat could possibly go right\nhey Mike what's your perfect party to\nrace ratio race 60 party 40. one party\nthe three race I like half and half\nwe're a 100 party and one of the coolest\nthings about this event is they feed you\nbreakfast lunch and dinner\njust over 700 of these crazy folks\nlook Becker here yo changing some Focus\nsettings here\nare you kidding me one of the things\nthat's so cool about grindero is that\nthere are four time segments throughout\nthe whole ride or Race So until you get\nto those segments you do not have to\nrace you can just ride the ride and each\nsegment is completely different from the\nnext there's a road time trial a gravel\ndescent a gravel climb and a single\ntrack section so no matter what bike you\nhave you have brought the wrong bike\n[Laughter]\nDrew what's the game plan are we trying\nfor these segments are we just like\ndoing the thing we're just doing the\nthing okay yeah\ndoing the thing\nalso grind hero notoriously Dusty\nturn up that atmosphere\nhey Drew hey Dustin hey tell me about\nyour bike oh I'm glad you asked this is\nuh Canyon Grizzle grinduro purple it's\naluminum heavy heavy wheels and the\nprice is

don't think I'm gonna go all out\nGod Save the Queen here we go\noh I'm getting tired this section is\nkind of long\nhow was that fun\nfirst segment down the vibe is settled\ninto the ride some people are going a\nlittle more chill some people are taking\nit a little serious\neveryone's finding their Rhythm how's\nyour Rhythm Drew uh a little loose\noh oh that's just the headset\nsnack stop\nthey've got a very busy bike support\nthere's alcoholic drinks I think there's\nbacon food watermelon everybody's\nconfused nobody knows where they're\ngoing\nhey Albert what's your perfect party to\nrace ratio\nI would say grindero a solid 95 to 5 95\nParty come here it's awesome the riding\nis amazing Rory tell me about your bike\nit's a discontinued unfortunately salsa\nPowder Keg put some SRAM axis with some\nof the Shimano Saint downhill breaks and\nsome velocity rims made in America\nkeeping it non-carbon on this bike but\nyeah we're stoked probably a smart move\nyeah\n29 by 2.4 is the tire selection for\ntoday\nGene\nyou\n30 miles in 3 000 feet what's your\nstatus\nstarting to get a little cracked out\nwe're roughly halfway temperature\nholding it a steady 90 degrees I'm a\nlittle more spent than I expected\nI am going to complete it I may or may\nnot enjoy it\nand let's see what happens\nwe found the perfect lone layer Trail\nhere in Mount Shasta California\nright around Lake Siskiyou\nit's a perfect pedestrian party path oh\nthere's lunch yes\nuh how many bikes do you own four I'm\nlike well six I'll be honest six all\nfueled up ready to go even though we're\nactually kind of like tired now and our\nlegs are achy\nI guess we'll keep going Road stage two\nno one's looking forward to this\nall right the plan is for Drew and I to\nPace line we're switching off every\nminute\nthis does\nwe lost Drew I'm gonna try to Soldier on\nfor the good of all mankind\nI was done\nnow the trick is to make sure I don't\ncompletely deplete myself before the\nnext two stages and the third one I\nfancy myself like\na mid-level contender for\nfor the middle\nI think I can land right in there\nnice and nice and soft in the middle\noh yeah I went with the dco today I've\njust been through the most stuff with it\nso whatever this is gonna dish at me I\nmay not enjoy it but I will be able to\nstruggle through it\nthanks to my familiar whip\nthe old dco\nlove you buddy Shameless plug this is\nthe last year villier's gonna offer the\nyena with the dco colorway that I made\nit's like a decline colorway a little\ncommotion camo so if you want one

it's been a\nlong day it's been very hot a lot of\ndust in the lungs\na lot of miles in the legs\nbut the vibe is high\nand the mood is right so I think the\nplan is to take Whatchamacallit to\ndangle

all\nencompassing all the snacks and all the\nVibes I'm definitely tired I can even\nhear it but I didn't crack and I'm\nI'm proud of that\nthere were definitely a lot of people\nwho did crack and if you don't want to\nwait till next year to ride this exact\nsame course the route's already online\nand I suggest staying at the lodge base\nenough out of a soft Landing for a big\nday on the mountain
