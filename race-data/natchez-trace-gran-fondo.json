      "experience": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "The Natchez Trace offers controlled access roads without commercial chaos, letting riders focus on the historical route.

Local shops survive despite premium pricing, indicating dedicated cyclist base."

      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Registration runs $60-100. Nashville costs stay moderate compared to coastal markets, though local cycling services command premium pricing. The Gran Fondo shop reputation for being \"the only bike shop that can survive even when they sell over retail price\" suggests cyclists accept higher costs for quality service. Similar expense level to Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."
