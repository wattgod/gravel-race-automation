Manageable suffering that rewards climbers without destroying recreational riders."

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Tennessee weather remains unpredictable, but the Trace offers seasonal advantages.

      "altitude": {
        "score": 1,

      "race_quality": {

      "experience": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "The Natchez Trace offers controlled access roads without commercial chaos, letting riders focus on the historical route. However, the \"trainer\"-like repetitive terrain of rolling hills through identical tree corridors limits scenic variety compared to more dramatic cycling destinations."
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Active cycling community discusses the area with specific route knowledge - hammydad recommends \"backroads surrounding the Trace (particularly Natchez Trace Rd and Liepers Creek Rd)\" with detailed connector information. Local shops survive despite premium pricing, indicating dedicated cyclist base."
      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "The aerobars-friendly terrain attracts time trial and triathlon training rather than technical gravel racing talent. Nashville area cycling community exists but focuses on roads like \"Old Hwy 96 or Waddell Hollow\" for variety rather than challenging gravel competition."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Access to 444 miles of federally maintained parkway without commercial traffic offers premium infrastructure most gran fondos can't match.

      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
