      "summary": "Ned Gravel is the intimate Colorado experience—no massive crowds, no lottery drama, just quality gravel in beautiful high country. The Tungsten course at 70 miles is the premier distance, featuring 8,300 feet of climbing at 8,000-10,300 feet elevation. This is less technical but more race-oriented than other courses, with steep hills and rough country roads that pay homage to the Peak to Peak area's mining history. Perfect for Colorado locals or those who want altitude racing without Leadville's intensity.",
      "strengths": [
        "Intimate vibe: Small enough to feel personal, big enough to have energy.",
        "Altitude: Real high-country racing for those who want to test themselves.",
        "Nederland: Quirky mountain town with character."
      ],
      "weaknesses": [
        "Size: Less energy than bigger events. If you want festival atmosphere, look elsewhere.",

        "Access: Nederland is close to Boulder but requires mountain driving."

But don't let the intimate vibe fool you—the Tungsten course at 70 miles with 8,300 feet of climbing at altitude is a serious challenge. The altitude will affect you more than you think, especially if you're coming from sea level. The steep hills and rough country roads demand fitness and pacing, not just enthusiasm.",
      "consequences": [
        "Nederland lodging is very limited. Book immediately or stay in Boulder (30 min drive).",
