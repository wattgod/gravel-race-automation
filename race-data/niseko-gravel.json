The elevation gain matters more than absolute altitude—climbing through the Niseko mountain range without thin-air concerns. Modest altitude compared to Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

One rider suffered three flats on gravel sections, adding mechanical costs. The ski town infrastructure that enables the event also drives up every expense. More expensive than Atlas Mountain Race. As Getting There puts it: \"If flying in, one would go to New Chitose (CTS), rent a car, and drive for a little over 2 hours.
