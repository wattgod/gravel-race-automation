        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Forest roads wind through thickly wooded terrain and rice field paths rather than high alpine zones.

The elevation gain matters more than absolute altitude—climbing through the Niseko mountain range without thin-air concerns."

While it draws YouTubers and former pros, international recognition stays minimal."

Weekend format includes outdoor expo and live music."

Early bird discounts offer 10% off, and the experience includes terrain \"you cannot find elsewhere in the archipelago.\" Premium pricing reflects unique access but strains budgets for a regional event."

        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Flying to Hokkaido costs serious money, then you're dealing with Niseko resort area pricing year-round. Race entry hits ¥15,000 before accommodation or meals. One rider suffered three flats on gravel sections, adding mechanical costs. The ski town infrastructure that enables the event also drives up every expense."
