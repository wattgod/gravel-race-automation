Similar distance to Crusher in the Tushar."

      "technicality": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "The course is '20% single track, 50% forest road, 30% bitumen' with varied surfaces including 'pitted fields, rocky sections, rapid downhills and some very technical sections.' Organizers removed 'a few of the most difficult trail sections' to create 'a course that you should be able to ride around with no dismount sections required.' Similar technical demands to Gravel Worlds."

        "explanation": "The signature challenge is the 6km climb up Mother Mountain, described as one of 'the most challenging climbs at Mt Tinbeerwah, Sheppersons Hill and Cooran Tablelands Range.' With 1250m total elevation and front-loaded climbing, it creates decisive early separation before easier terrain home. More climbing than SBT GRVL at the same score."

      "climate": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "July in Queensland hinterland means cool, dry winter conditions - pleasant for riding but hardly inspiring. You're looking at mild temperatures that won't create memorable stories about heat survival or weather battles. Safe, predictable conditions that won't add drama to your day. More weather exposure than Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Noosa Hinterland maxes out around 500 meters above sea level - basically nothing for altitude considerations. Starting near sea level and climbing to low hills means zero physiological challenge from thin air. Lower altitude than Gravel Worlds — no thin-air concerns."

One rider infiltrated the course 'on the road bike with 23mm Maxxis Refuse tyres' encountering 'gravel and single trail' - testament to the surface variety."
      },
      "prestige": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "This is explicitly 'a non-competitive event with just one category for all riders and no prizes given' - zero career cache. The marketing positions it as 'not a cycling event' but rather 'an all terrain adventure' within a broader MTB festival where gravel feels secondary to the main attractions."
      },
      "race_quality": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "They're learning from mistakes - the 2026 course promises to 'tick all the boxes' after riders complained about the previous year's 'epic adventure' being too much of both. The climb to 'the Mother' followed by mostly flat/downhill sounds like decent design, but when organizers are still figuring out basic course logistics, you're essentially paying to beta-test their event."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "The route delivers on variety through 'outrageously spectacular playground' terrain with premium gravel roads, farms, and trails. The Festival Village atmosphere with 'bars, food, entertainment and industry expo' creates a proper event experience, even if the 'GET DIRTY AND DISCOVER' marketing feels manufactured."
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "The Festival Village hub creates community gathering space with post-ride entertainment and industry expo. The sustainability focus includes zero waste goals and koala reforestation support, attracting environmentally conscious participants, though the non-competitive format draws recreational rather than serious gravel riders."
      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Course options range from 30km 'suitable for any ability' to elite-level challenges, but the non-competitive format with 'no prizes given' attracts participation-focused riders. The 100km MTB course 'can take even the most experienced riders up to ten hours,' suggesting the serious athletes choose that over gravel. Less competitive depth than Almanzo 100."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "$187.20 AUD for 88.3km through Queensland hinterland is reasonable if you want a supported tour. The multi-terrain variety and course redesign show they're investing in improvement. But paying nearly $200 for zero competitive element and beta-testing their routing feels steep for what's essentially an organized group ride."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Registration runs $80-130 AUD. Noosa in July means peak tourist season pricing for accommodation, though winter rates beat summer madness. The Sunshine Coast location keeps flights reasonable compared to remote Australian destinations. Entry fee includes AusCycling membership if needed, but expect typical resort town markups on food and lodging around the famous beach destination. Similar expense level to Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."
