The\nonly one in Copenhagen.\n&gt;&gt; So we go north. We have four races. Two\nfrom Berlin to Copenhagen and two from\nCopenhagen to Oslo. Always around 7 to\n800 km [music]\nand both a road and a gravel edition.\nNordic chase brings [music] three\nthings. It brings you a great challenge,\na long ultra distance [music] race. It\nbrings you adventure. You go through\nthree countries and you will have super\nnice landscapes, roads, more of a\ncoastal ride, gravel more inland. And\nthe third pillar is the community part\nwhere we host something before the race.\nWe make sure that you will never ride\nalone. And we have a super exciting\nparty at the end after the [music] race\nas well.\nThe Nordic Chase will offer you the\npossibility to go either for [music] the\nwin and go all out, but will also be a\nsuper nice experience for the ones that\n[music] want to explore more the nature,\nlook around, have a great time, and see\nlandscapes that they maybe have not seen\nso far.

          "transcript": "[Music]\nthe healers, they needed the, you know,\nhelp from from these uh natural spirits.\nSo that's that's why there's a there's a\nlong long long history in Finland that\nwhen you move to a new place, sauna\nfirst.\n&gt;&gt; Feel like this part of Finland is really\ngood for just being outside.\n&gt;&gt; It's freezing.\nFound some gravel. Looks really nice,\nactually.\nWe're dressed for a downpour, but I\nthink we're going to be okay.\nI think we're\nlucky with the weather.\nMarty and I have traveled\n10 hours north in Finland and we're now\nin Ruka\ntrying some of the gravel. Oh, it's a\nvery small. It's very nice.\n&gt;&gt; What are we looking for, Maddie?\n&gt;&gt; We're looking for a bakery. Well, it's a\ncafe. We are looking for a cafe for a\ncoffee and a baked good, but I couldn't\nplot to it on Hanky Bari. It's open.\nOld milk\nsay oat milk\ntime.\nI think this is a sauna with a view, but\nit is a bit cloudy.\n[Applause]\nIt's day two of Marut's\nRooker training camp to whip Josh into\nshape for his off season.\n&gt;&gt; I think there's just endless gravel\nhere.\nThe jackets are off, the sun's out, and\nthe leaves are pinging. It is gorgeous.\nWoohoo!\nI was advised to go for a Finnish\ntopping, but having had Finnish food for\nseveral days now, I needed some Italian\nhome comforts, even though I'm not\nItalian. So, I got the Italian\nmortaza rather than getting like a\nreindeer pizza.\n&gt;&gt; For dessert, we're going for blueberry.\n&gt;&gt; Don't hide the middle course that you\nhad.\nYou didn't just have peasy. You came\nback and you made a bowl of pasta.\n&gt;&gt; For dessert, we're going for blueberry\nyogurt topped with blueberries\n&gt;&gt; served with a side of\n&gt;&gt; served with a side. We love the blubs,\nbut I think of these blubes, the best\nblubs, the real blubes, because the\njuice tastes a bit like water, doesn't\nit?\n&gt;&gt; The one on the flight was amazing.\n&gt;&gt; Oh, the one on the flight was really\ngood. I reckon this one's got no added\nsugar, you know. And the one on the\nflight was probably just sugar. There's\nnothing in this, Josh.\nBut 100 g is 8 calories. It's 7%\nblabbard, which I assume means\nblueberry. Blab.\nOh, and no. Then it's 3% Blab's juice,\nwhich is blueberry juice. Do\n&gt;&gt; you think these blueberries are going to\nbe better than like\n&gt;&gt; the forest ones? Probably not.\n&gt;&gt; She said they're not.\n&gt;&gt; They're not bad blueberries.\n&gt;&gt; Blueberries from Berry Hub.\n&gt;&gt; Blueberries. Quite a subtle fruit. I\ndon't know whether the ones we have are\nlike jacked up in the UK, but these are\nquite subtle. Like\n&gt;&gt; it might be just out of season.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, maybe. Well, we're only just after\nblueberry season.\nGood morning, Maddie.\n&gt;&gt; Good morning.\nWe are riding to an activity.\nUm, which means we're carrying all the\nstuff.\n&gt;&gt; You mean Josh is carrying all the stuff?\n&gt;&gt; Josh is carrying most of the stuff. He's\ngot both pairs of Birkenstocks.\nOne upon the frame top tube and one on\nhis backpack. Um, and we're going to\nwhat is it? A day in the life of a fin.\nWe've got everything on there.\nWe've got some um Birkenstocks and a and\na coat.\n&gt;&gt; Fun fact of the day, there are 5.6\nmillion inhabitants in Finland\nand 3 million sauners. Do you like my\nfun fact?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. There are also 1,911\nlakes in the Kusama region. Samis\ninhabited nor northern Finland and also\nthey were they were in the early days\nalso uh living in the south of Finland.\nUm Kama was also inhabited by them.\nthere was a population of about 3 400\num uh sis here uh in the end of the\n1600s and that's then when the first\nFinnish newcomers came here from South\nFinland and um for thousands of years uh\nthis was also Sami land and the name of\nthe village Wonki actually has to do\nwith hunting so this was the local\nSami's hunting area a hunting area and\nmany places in Kosamo We don't have the\nSami culture and the local you know\nlanguage or dialect has been lost but\nthe names of places have been given\ngiven by the Samis who lived here for\nthousands of years and they have a few\nholy places also here in Kusama like\nsacrificial places that that they used\nthey they believe that the first\nbuilding you built to that you know\nvirgin pristine nature area with no\nother buildings that will lure the most\npowerful spirit of the region to move\ninto that building and because sauna was\na place where you not only bathe it, you\ndid transitional rituals, uh annual\nrituals, uh babies were born in a sauna,\ndead were washed in the sauna and\nillnesses were cured in the sauna. So\nthe healers they needed the you know\nhelp from these uh natural spirits. So\nthat's that's why there's a there's a\nwhen you move to a new place sauna\nfirst. Yeah. so that you get the most\npowerful spirit to to work there. And\nthen when this belief kind of died but\nstill it it was a custom those days when\num the early comers were already\nChristians but they still do you know\nthe sauna first. Of course it's like\nit's a good building to build first\nbecause especially summertime you can\nyou can use the benches for sleeping and\nyou can use the stove for cooking and\nthen you have you can wash you know you\nhave you have the means to to heat up\nwater and and wash there wash yourself\nthere. So that's why the that's why the\nsalona sauna first\nversions of the of the of it has sugar\nuh a little bit of salt and then\ncardamom in in Finland we call it bulla\np u l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l\nl l l a and in Sweden it's called bulla\nwith a b so so this this pastry was was\na gift from the sweet and if you ever\nbeen to Sweden they have many fasc\nso so they always you The coffee. The\ncoffee.\n&gt;&gt; Coffee and the pastry.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, coffee and a pastry. Let me see.\nSo, maybe you can. And then, of course,\nyou you shouldn't like roll it too thin.\n&gt;&gt; Luckily, I've actually done this before,\nso I'm not a newbie to cinnamon roll\nmaking. I'm so excited to see these.\nRoll with this as well. Maybe like that.\nPress it in the middle. And then then\nflip it. And then you have to add like\nmore more flour to it. If it's if it if\nit's not moving, if you don't make\nholes, then it's going to be like um you\nknow, just a big pocket full of hot air\nwith a with a very thin bottom crust and\na very thin upper crust. The oven has\nbeen heated to near 300°, sometimes a\nlittle bit over, but the but the bread\nthe bread cooks really quickly. Bakes\nreally quickly when it's about uh 280 to\n300°.\nI'm close. Do I need to go faster?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you need to go actually you go you\nput you you put this like under the\nbread. Yeah. A little bit under the one\nhand. And then a lower angle. And then\nyou have to do like a quick move. Yeah.\nNearly there. Be careful. Be careful.\nOh, be careful. Be careful.\n&gt;&gt; Oh my gosh. No. It was so good. There\nyou go.\n&gt;&gt; Okay. Okay. A bit of excitement. No\nworries.\n&gt;&gt; And now what do I do? I release it.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you you put it\n&gt;&gt; left side.\n&gt;&gt; That was really hard.\n&gt;&gt; So, your turn. I hope that that we we've\ncovered the bottom with the maybe a\nlittle bit, you know.\n&gt;&gt; Yes. Wow,\nthat was too good.\n&gt;&gt; If you worked in a pizzeria, I had an\nItalian.\n&gt;&gt; You need this sound. So then you know\nthat the the bread is ready. Never tried\nmousse before, strangely.\nAnd I think you've got mushrooms.\n&gt;&gt; Chanterels.\n&gt;&gt; Shanterels.\nIt feels quite soft.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\nIt's going to be quite hot.\n&gt;&gt; How do you like moose?\nIt tastes like beef\nwith like\na bit more tender. That's actually\nreally nice. But I think it's cuz it's\nin a really nice red wine sauce.\nJust having a moment getting first.\n&gt;&gt; How How's this trip in Finland been?\n&gt;&gt; It's been pretty good to be honest. A\nlot of nature and I like nature. Feel\nlike this part of Finland's really good\nfor just being outside.\n&gt;&gt; It's a good way to end the trip. I think\nmaybe a roller coaster though.\n&gt;&gt; Oh, the child. Do you have like a full\nseat belt on? Yeah, I've only got one\naround my waist.\n&gt;&gt; It's not enough.\n&gt;&gt; You're on the child seat.\n&gt;&gt; I am on the child seat,\n&gt;&gt; but we're under 150 kilos. So,\n&gt;&gt; when she said, \"Are you under 150\nkilos?\" I was like,\n&gt;&gt; \"Yes, of course we're under.\" And then I\nobviously realized accumulatively, but\nalso, yes, definitely.\nOh my god. Slow down.\n&gt;&gt; Oh my god.\nAmazing.\n&gt;&gt; Thanks. So sonvatar is a is a overall\nsauna goddess from pre-Christian times\nand um you are asking if she's living in\nthe sauna you are asking her to come to\nsauna to to bring into the sauna the\ndifferent like um like uh sauna remedies\nthe different trees and leaves and and\nthings like this and then you are asking\nher to prepare the you know to to kind\nof like prepare the sauna remedies and\nuh then to help you bathe uh with these\nremedies. ies in order to to uh cut down\nyour problems, your worries, to kill any\nillnesses, to help you um win your\nbattles. And you know, because sauna is\nnot only it's only it's not only\nphysical well-being, it's only for it's\nalso for mental well-being.",

          "transcript": "so what makes a great bik packing route\nobviously quiet roads hard packed gravel\nperhaps some single track for adventure\nWild open Vistas epic climbs with\nstunning views great wild camping spots\ntraditional Mountain lodges easy access\nfor transport and Food\nSupplies not all Roots offer this in\nfact there are not many out there that\ncan take all these boxes very easily and\nthis my friends is why I'm going to\nintroduce you to Norway's greatest bike\npacking\n[Music]\nroute so this Journey Begins in Norway's\ncapital Oslo it's early Saturday morning\nin late August the whole country has\nbeen blessed with Sunshine for the\nweekend I'm looking for a weekend route\nthat is easy logistically with little\nplanning pre-booking or or\norganization m ofan is like the\nequivalent of Plug and Play click and\ncollect out of the box ready you\nbasically just jump on a train and go\nyou don't need to organize anything\nelse so this is the plan of action we\njump on the osot to Bergen train and get\noff halfway at the town of ghoul where\nthe Journey Begins day one we cycle 130\nkm to the only town on the route by to\nstun where we'll camp for the night day\ntwo is a comfortable 100 km to the end\npoint at vinstra and then from there\nit's a simple task of jumping on the\ntonim to Oslo train and 3 hours later\nwe're back home a total of 230 km of\ncycling 4,400 M of elevation gain with\nover 85% on perfect gravel roads\nso it's the last weekend of Summer\nperfect weather first train heading to\nthe mountains on a Saturday you'd think\nit'd be full of bik Packers but no just\nthis guy here and this is the beginning\nof a beautiful\nfriendship that's\nit so do you have any shoe\ncovers so like a couple of nerds were\nsat in the food Carriage comparing and\ntalking about our bite packing setups\nboring the hell out of everybody around\ndoes we were like Kindred Spirits we\nwere doing the exact same thing Eric was\ngoing a little bit further on and doing\na different route but same idea great\nweather power out a route to get back to\nOslo on Sunday what better way to spend\nyour\nweekend the great thing about the oso to\nBergen line is there's usually a full\ncarriage for bikes the reason for this\nis because of the famous roll of iron or\nR of iron cycling route\nwhich basically all these people are\nheading to it's kind of the only route\nthat most people know about I should\nmention that this is in 20121 and this\nis what the new cycling Carriage looks\nlike still plenty of space but you\nshould always book your bike on board in\nadvance so it's uh 9:30 it's 9:30 and we\nare in ghoul and uh the sun is shining\nwe got blue sky which is fantastic but\nit is not warm here there's a really\nreally cold Bree\num so I'm glad I brought some extra\nclothing honestly nothing is guaranteed\nin Norway that is for sure you should\nalways bring extra\nclothing all right guys this is what\nit's all about get up early on a\nSaturday morning you jump on the train\nand now I'm\nhere straight away you've got an 800 M\nclimb which will bring you up onto the\ntop of rolling Alpine Plains from there\nit flattens out with spectacular views\nfor the next 200 and so\nkm the gravel is in excellent condition\nand the traffic very light once in a\nwhile a car or tractor may pass you but\nin general these are cycling roads\nwhat I love about this route is in the\nwinter it's very popular for\nCrossCountry skiing so every 40 or 50 km\nyou're going to come across a small Cafe\nmaybe with a kiosk so easy to keep\nyourself resupplied without having to\ncarry too much food but just make sure\nyou check the opening times as sometimes\nthey close\nearly and what about water yeah you're\nnot going to have a problem filling them\nbottles up fast open\nples there trees dotted about\nalthough this section is very very flat\nyou get beautiful views of hemal\nmountain range and then on day two you\nhave yiman National Park as your\nbackdrop two spectacular mountain ranges\nalways on view oh my oh\nmy after a quick stop in vast set I\ndecided to go off Route a little bit and\ntry out a bit more of a rough road you\nsee there are so many gravel roads in\nthis area you don't have to stick to the\nroute you can experiment if you want but\nbe warned the road may disappear hello\nhow are\nyou so the path is turned onto basically\na single track for\nhikers 1.4 km to the normal\nRoad 1.4\nwe have a road we have a road goodbye\nfoot path hello\nRoad after that little stop at the cabin\nI took the wrong road out go and ask go\nand ask and ended up in a bit of a mess\nbut it was a little bit of an adventure\nand all roads will lead to vinra\neventually so we found our\nway don't you dare run out in front of\nme don't you dare oh bloody H where did\nyou come\nfrom wow what a view what a\nview not too shabby\nnow\nthat is a\ncabin oh\nnearly\nnearly we're going this way\nunfortunately I'd like to go this way\nbut this way it\nis the mighty slet fella often described\nas the sky Road climbing to over 1,000\n300 m above sea level it looks like a\nlittle Hill from a distance but you soon\nrealize this is no ordinary\nMountain if you take the northern route\nfrom ghoul this is one of Norway's\ntoughest gravel climbs an average\ngradient of over 10% will make you\nsuffer every meter up I can't describe\nyou how hard this climb is it's just\nnonstop up up up like there's no switch\nbacks to ease the gradient\nit's just one long stray\nroad with this crazy\ngradient at the top\nguys I think we're at the\ntop on reaching the top you are rewarded\nwith one of the best Gravel Road views\nin\nNorway oh wow wow wow wow that's\nincredible the camera and drone just not\ngive this Place Justice you need to be\nhere the edge of yiman National Park\nlies in front of you for the first time\nit's like a scene out of Lord of the\nRings the route is now entering a new\nstage some reindeers over there but\nthey're a little bit too far\naway you just about see him can't\nyou now what I should be doing is\npitching my tent here but I brought a\nbivvy to save weight and it's freezing\ncold and there are mosquitoes about so I\nhead down to the town of B\nStan where I find out the Beatles are\nplaying I should have been doing this\nbut I had this instead what a school boy\nerror don't bring a bivy if you have a\ntent it's worth the extra weight\nwell good morning from the road um it's\n9:00 it's a beautiful day again but we\nare 1,000 m above sea level and I tell\nyou when I got out of my uh bivvy this\nmorning oh my God it was so cold it was\njust that kind of mountain cold so we I\nslept at about about 850 m above sea\nlevel which is kind of like the lowest\npoint in this whole area this is Road 51\nit's quite a famous road cuz it goes\nkind of through yahyan or to the side of\nyahyan which is like the probably the\nmost famous National Park in Norway home\nof the Giants as well all the\nreally high mountains are in Norway so\nthe ones over 2,000 M so it's going to\nbe pretty\neffic 13 km from B stone and you reach\nanother beautiful mountain lodge this\none is one of my favorites I've actually\ndone a video on this which you can watch\nhere where I interview the owner and\ngive you a guided tour yeah okay welcome\nto bigd helds hotel bigd is a very old\nuh hotel in the mountains of Norway it\nwas actually established in uh\n1897 by a guy\ncalled it's beautiful\ninside but outside's even better\nthe paved scenic route to valder fer\ncontinues North but we're going to say\ngoodbye to the cars and jump on a\nbeautiful gravel road heading\neast Yim and vagan is probably the most\nfamous Gravel Road in Norway 45 km of\nwide open Alpine mountain terrain that\nticks every cyclist gravel Adventure box\njust make sure you remember to stop and\nturn around once in a while the views\nare something else\noh this is beautiful guys tell\nyou so this road is definitely\neverything that it made out to be it's\nabsolutely stunning in the landscape\nit's just so raw we' got a lot of trees\ndown here other side it's just kind of\nsweeping mountain\nlandscape and you can just see so far\nall around\nyou you can see for absolutely miles\nit's stunning absolutely stunning the\nroad's pretty damn good condition uh\nlots of ups and downs as you'd expect\nbut my goodness this is one hell of a\ngravel road I don't think you'll find\nmany better gravel roads in in Europe to\nAsia and wild wild wild\nwild look at this you move left or right\ndoesn't matter you want to play chicken\nwe'll play chicken yeah MAV in English\ntranslates to the milk way or the milk\nroute and that's basically cuz all the\ncows here in the summer can run freely\naround and apparently Legend has it this\nproduces the world's greatest milk\nso after around 40 km we dropped down a\nfew hundred m to the tree line and we\nreached basically a beautiful Forest\nArea and this will characterize most of\nthe region now as we head to\nvinstra W this would have been the\nperfect place to Camp last\nnight 600 m above sea levels so it's not\ngoing to be too\ncold look at this Lake\nman so what are your thoughts on this\nroute the weather up here is usually not\nthis good cold wet and windy conditions\nare not uncommon but having cycled this\nroute in all types of conditions I don't\nregret any opportunity to explore this\nterrain as you've seen logistically it's\neasy to do and to make it even easier on\ncy.com I have created a full detailed\npage explaining everything about this\nroute and all the Alternatives add-ons\ndetours extended options for every type\nof Adventure join the free membership\nand get\naccess and lastly what about the other\nbite Packer I met on the train on the\nway to\nghoul yeah I think he had a good time\ntoo and the year after we actually met\nup and did a few rots together you can\nwatch them here some of them are really\ngood check this one\nout no I agreed with it as well it's\nboth of our stupid ideas",
