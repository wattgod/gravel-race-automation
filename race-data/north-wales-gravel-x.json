At that intensity, finishing 3rd meant the distance separates fitness levels but doesn't provide the suffer-fest length that breaks weekend warriors from serious racers. More compact than Grinduro."

        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "The course opens with \"a tight and punchy little 10% climb\" after the dam wall, then delivers what Jon in Sweden called descents with \"technical cornering and rough terrain\" that weren't \"too steep, but fairly twisty.\" Standard gravel tires (35-45mm) handle the terrain, but the mix challenges bike handling skills. Similar technical demands to Gravel Worlds."

        "explanation": "1,500m over 78km delivers consistent climbing without being gratuitously brutal. The punchy climbs through Clocaenog Forest and rolling terrain around the reservoirs create varied elevation challenges. Not Alpine suffering, but enough vertical to separate the prepared from the optimistic across relatively short distance. Similar elevation profile to Gravel Worlds.

More weather exposure than Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."
      },
      "altitude": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "The course runs around Welsh reservoirs and through Clocaenog Forest at negligible elevation. No altitude considerations affect performance or require acclimatization - sea-level fitness translates directly to course demands. Lower altitude than Gravel Worlds — no thin-air concerns."

      "adventure": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Circuits of Llyn Alwen and Llyn Brenig through Clocaenog Forest deliver North Wales wilderness experience. The mix of reservoirs, technical forest climbs, and remote gravel roads takes you properly away from civilization. Not epic multi-day adventure, but real backcountry riding that reminds you why Welsh terrain built hard riders. As Official Event Description puts it: \"This is wild, remote & scenic gravel riding but all within 2 hours of Birmingham, Manchester & Liverpool. Camp over for a great gravel weekend including a club ride in Eryri National Park on Sunday.\""

        "explanation": "Jon in Sweden noted seeing \"literally dozens of guys at the side of the road covered in sealant\" from mechanical failures, while his own chain \"sneaked past the catcher and came off\" by 13km. The course delivers proper terrain through Clocaenog Forest, but mechanical support appears stretched across remote sections."

Higher total cost than Badlands."

          "transcript": "James here from Nottingham physio for\nanother video So today we're going to be\nrecapping my race from yesterday at\ngravel World Series Wales uh just going\nto run you through what went on and uh\nyeah how it got on yeah so a little\nrundown of course it was 110 km with\n1,00 M of climbing we did that over two\nlaps um the course was pretty much all\noff-road so it was mainly forest fire\ntracks and did even have a little bit of\nsingle track throwing in there which was\nwas quite good fun yeah favorite courses\nI've done so far um as gravel racing\ngoes you know it was the climbs weren't\ntoo long and you sort of managed to roll\nover them with a bit of speed and stuff\nlike that so it was about a 3-hour drive\nfrom nothingham it was near ruin Wales\nso it was a place called Clint brenig I\ntried to get that right but uh yeah so\nwe got there and I signed on and then\npretty much got to warming up really it\nwas um not that long before the race\nwhen we got there so pinned up and then\ndid a bit of a ride down the road and\nthen just got on the rollers for my\nwarmup so did my usual 20 minutes on the\nrollers few efforts stuff like that um\nyeah the weather wasn't great on Sunday\nbut it wasn't too bad so it was just\nlike a Mist um for the whole day really\nso I made sure to wrap up plenty before\nI headed down to the start um and then\nyeah I managed to uh find myself on the\nfront which was handy um the race\nstarted off like just a dead straight\ngravel track along the side of the\nreservoir race got underway and I found\nmyself at the front um leading the\nleading the group up the down the first\nfire Road and then it went up a short\nclimb for he sort of got onto the um\nlike a flowing Road section really that\nfollowed the edge of the reservoir um\nthat ended up being pretty chill\nactually um I ended up on the front not\nreally out of choice but\num no one was coming through and I was\njust you know tickling away at the\npedals really not going that hard um and\nno one was Keen to come\npass yeah so like I was saying they\nstayed pretty chill till um the first\nsingle track section which was about 5k\nin I sort of knew roughly where it was\nbut I didn't get into it in that great\nposition com in in about 12 I say um and\nuh yeah this is where it start to get\nhard so I think uh Cameron Mason got on\nthe front and he started to push the\npace a bit and it was a bit of a drag to\nstart with and then it went into like a\nflowy uh twisty section with like some\nbig puddles and stuff like that I was\npretty much in just in the wheels really\ncouldn't move up no one could comp pass\nreally and I was just making sure stay\nfocused and watch out for the uh the\nturns coming up um one thing in my\nfavorite was a headwind so that made it\na lot easier for the people following um\nso even though he was pushing the pace\non the front it wasn't too bad in the\nwheels and then we turned right onto the\nTAC and then it accelerated again so I\nreally felt the effect of sort of being\na little bit further back in the group\nso the front were already up to speed by\nthe time I came out of that corner so I\nhad to push quite hard to get back on to\nthe group um doing quite a big\neffort um yeah but I did make it back uh\nand then it yeah started to roll and go\nget pretty fast again and um you have to\nkeep an eye out for the poles on this\nbit cuz when you rid close behind\nsomeone there was it was quite hard to\nsee what was coming up so there was\nquite a few times where you just sort of\na pole would appear sort of right in\nfront of you um and some of them some of\nthem were pretty big potholes\nunfortunately uh the rider just in front\nof me Joe griffs caught pothole just\nslightly wrong or caught the edge of it\nand uh yeah as you can see had a bit of\na nasty crash um um I just managed to\navoid him but uh that left a bit of a\ngap but luckily for me uh Ben Swift was\ncaught out as well so I used him to\nfollow uh back to the front so that was\na big help I did have to make a pretty\nbig effort to get on his wheel but I\nknew it' be a lot easier sitting behind\nhim and trying to sort of pull it back\nmyself and then I just tried to make\nsure I was moved up a little bit in the\ngroup cuz I didn't want to be put out\nthe back like that again because it was\nhard work\num closing down the gaps and that so\nyeah we continued on really and it was\nlike a rolling sort of rubbish Road\nreally it wasn't quite gravel and it was\nsome of it was tacked but um yeah and\nthere was a couple cattle grids on the\nroads you had to watch out for as well\ncuz they were wet um yeah but it was you\nknow remained as a group really till we\nturned left and went up the first big\nclimb came into the climb pretty decent\nposition sort of fifth sixth wheel\num uh but Connor Swift was on the front\nand he was yeah starting to squeeze on\nso um yeah this was the climb I got\ndropped really so as you see on the on\nthe GoPro I managed to stick with them\nfor about half the\nclimb but then it just got a little bit\ntoo much for me um and I knew if I\ncarried on trying to hang with them I'd\nprobably like explode properly so um I\ndecided to drop it back a little bit to\na more sustainable Pace the first 2\nminutes of the climb averaged almost 500\nwatts um and yeah that was a lot\nespecially 500 watts like even more cuz\ni' done you know the 25 minutes before\nwe got to the climb at 377 normalized as\nwell which is yeah pushing on definitely\num and that soften me up for the climb\nso even if um I can do that power and\ntrain and stuff like that it's another\nthing to do it after half an hour of\nhard racing so yeah I decided to S to a\nmore sustainable Pace that I thought I\ncould maintain um and I crushed the top\nsort of leading the chase group with one\none of Rider just in front um yeah and\nfrom there couple riders came around\ncame around me um and we started taking\nturns really um to catch that lead Rider\num that was just ahead but the front\ngroup of pretty much gone by that point\nmyself in a group of sort of I don't\nknow five to eight or something like\nthat um yeah and we worked well together\nreally\nfor quite a way there was sort of riders\njust dropping off every soften um the\nend of lap one there was only five us\nleft in that group uh yeah we've been\nworking together pretty well for the uh\nrest of the lap really and we started\nthe second lap much the same so the\nfirst sort of 25 30 minut minutes of the\nsecond lap we contining sort of rolling\nturns a little bit more unorganized\npossibly but yeah we were working\ntogether pretty decently um until we got\nto the first big climb again um but this\ntime uh wasn't Conor Swift that pushed\nthe pace CU obviously he was up the road\num it was one of two of the Riders from\nmy group over the top with only four\nRiders and then yeah continued on the\nnext sort of three or four climbs about\n10 minutes and and then the fourth Rider\ndropped off as well so he left with\nthree three Riders um\nabout third round the lap or something\nlike\nthat and I knew that I just needed to\nstick with this now and to give myself\nthe best chance cuz once you're on your\nown on that course although it was\nfairly hilly it did help a lot having\nsome Wheels to follow um and yeah draft\noff them a little bit so yeah stuck with\nthe group as long as I could but about\n25 kmers to go um one of them threw an\nattack\nin and the other Rider followed and I\njust couldn't match it like I didn't\nhave the punch um I think I was quite\ntired by that\npoint and I didn't want to like go\nreally deep into the red so I just\nthought you know hoped that I could sort\nof keep them within reach so I just\ntapped out my like a good strong pace\nand try my best to sort of keep them\ninside\nbut yeah after a few Hills they did just\nsort of disappear and I think they were\nstarting to work together again just to\nget rid of\nme so yeah I was pretty much on my well\nI was on my own for the rest of the race\nthen so I had 25 km uh time trial really\non slightly tired legs but I did manage\nto keep up good pace so yeah I felt like\nI finished really strong um didn't lose\ntoo much time to the two guys that\ndropped that dropped me earlier on um\nand yeah managed to hold on to to\nSeventh Place in the end which was the\nthe final qualification spot for worlds\nwhich yeah I was pretty pleased with I\nhad already qualified at the grow\nearlier in the year but it was uh nice\nto like yeah solidify that and like yeah\nI was pretty proud of the result in the\nend seventh in what was a really strong\nfield was uh yeah a really good result\nfor me thanks for watching everyone um\nif you want to leave a comment what you\nwant to see in the next one so more\nGoPro footage or power data or anything\nelse that you might want to see um yeah\nthis was James thanks for watching\ncheers",

In between there will be a parkrun in Ruthin, and some big climbs to ride over!\n\nWill I make it in time to catch my train home on Monday? \n\nHope you enjoy the film of my adventure, please like and subscribe to our channel: https://www.youtube.com/alittleadventuretime?sub_confirmation=1\n\nI've put together a blog post which has all the details of my route, where I stopped etc:\nhttps://www.alittleadventure.uk/the-wales-divide-solo-bikepacking-adventure/\n\n  Useful Links\n===============================\n\nKarl's Fish and Chips\nhttps://karlsfishandchips.co.uk/\n\nRuthin parkrun\nhttps://www.parkrun.org.uk/ruthinmemorialplayingfields/\n\nCafe R at Ruthin\nhttps://ruthincraftcentre.org.uk/cafe/\n\nCampsite by Newtown - Dolau Inn\nhttps://www.dolauinn.co.uk/\n\nErwood Station Cafe\nhttps://erwoodstationcraftcentre.co.uk/\n\n===============================\n  About Ian, Iona and Family\n===============================\nEach week on this channel Ian (Dad) and Iona share our little adventure experiences, often joined by Ewan (Iona’s older brother) and Ruth (Mum) too.\n\nOur weekends often start with parkrun. Iona is on a non-repeat parkrun tourism streak having now visited over 100 different places since she started parkrunning. But we don’t just do parkun and dash home, we love exploring the area and often use bikes and trains for our travels to keep our carbon footprint low and because it adds to the adventure too. When school holidays arrive, longer adventures are possible with Ewan and Iona both being keen cycle tourists and mountain climbers!\n\nSo if you like heading outdoors and your idea of a perfect weekend includes parkrun, climbing a mountain or exploring new places on two wheels then we would love to have you join us on our adventures.\n\nWe’d love it if you subscribed so you can follow our journey and hopefully be inspired to get out the door and have your own little adventures.

train from Birmingham to\ncatin to start my adventure at the\nLighthouse here at tacka beach my aim is\nto ride from the northermost quto mland\nwhals to the southernmost point in\nbetween there'll be a park run in ret\nand some big climbs to ride\nover will I make it in time to catch my\ntrain home on Monday\n[Music]\n[Applause]\ntraveled through\npretin and now on an old raway line\nheading out of pretin did stop off and\nfound a fish and chip shop so I'm hoping\non the way out I can find somewhere nice\nto stop and enjoy my fish and chips\ncan't come to the seaside and not get\nsome fish and chips can you perfect\nFriday night tea time\nwell enjoying my fish and chips having\ncycled a little way out of pisatin along\nthis old rway line and I have a fabulous\nview of the Sea and the mountains in the\ndistance as well you couldn't ask for a\nbetter restaurant view than this to\nenjoy your fish and chips too perfect\nway to start the weekend's Adventure I\ndo however also seem to have attracted\nsome very interested onlookers in the\nform of seagull so I think are\ndesperately hoping that I might leave\nthem some fish and chips Fred I don't\nthink they're going to be that lucky\nenjoying one of those perfect evenings\nfor cycling though it is a little bit\nBreezy but the views are spectacular\nover the\nmountains the sun is just gently\nsetting long quiet country lanes as a\ncar comes past and just enjoying the wsh\ncountryside however you do pay for the\nprice of wsh Countryside with some Walsh\nHills this has definitely been an\nundulating route so\nfar well the first day of Adventure is\ncomplete managed to find a bit of\nWoodland just outside of riin with a\nlovely Little Shelter that obviously\nsome young people have made in the\nWoodland which is a perfect spot for me\nto bivy for the night so I'm just not\ngoing to bother pitching the tent just\ngoing to use my bivy bag and be out in\nthe fresh air on a beautiful evening and\ntime to enjoy a kind of gin and tonic\nthat Ruth bought me as I sit and watch\nthe sheep in the field next to me see\nyou in the morning\ngood morning the beautiful sunny weather\nof yesterday has disappeared during the\nnight to the pitter patter of raindrops\nthis morning fortunately my bivy has\nkept me nice and warm and toasty and dry\novernight that's quite Pleasant just\nsitting here listening to the rain\nfalling but it's time to get up time to\nget cycling maybe time to do a park run\nfirst back ring which I passed through\nlast night just a little way back down\nthe road and get some breakfast there\nhopefully as\nwell but first time to pack up my V pag\nget back on that bike and get on the\nroad\nwell just cuz I'm on a cycle tour\ndoesn't mean I can't do a park R I've\nstopped off at the park one I have done\nbefore so I'm not depriving I owner of a\nnew park run last time I was here it was\nfor Deborah cassar's 100th park run so\nit was quite special last time I was\nhere today just a chance to get a bit of\na park R in before cycling to\nmidw sorry enjoy and I'm off a brief\ninterview from cycling to do a bit of\nrunning 5K in Rin the park run here last\ntime I was here was the de casar H\ndifferent park run it's nice to be back\nwell\ndone thank you\nMarshall one of the things that's\nspecial about this park run is the\nbeautiful views you get of the mountains\nas you're running it\nfabulous now I'm not going to record the\nwhole park r\nbecause I have done it before as I said\nso if you want to check it out have a\nlook at that video which is the one I\ndid with dears hundreds we just\ncompleted the second turn around point\nand you're back to do it all over again\na couple of\ntimes well just coming up to start my\nthird and final lap and the fastest\nrunner has just come past me laughing me\nhe's on for a sub 18 minute park run bit\nquicker than I'm doing it and we're\nrunning into the Finish now three laps\ncompleted R park run done just 60 or 70\nmiles to cycle next guys thank you done\ndone just enjoyed a lovely breakfast at\nthe cafe after park run probably wasted\na bit too much time chatting with other\nPark Runners here but it was lovely to\ncatch up and have a bit of a chat and\nnow back on the bike and start the route\nproper again hoping to get at least 60\nmiles done today and get somewhere south\nof um new town but we'll see how it\ngoes back on the route proper now\nclimbing out of riin just passed by\nwhere I camped last night through the\nWoodland there and definitely a good\nlong climb to get out of the Rin Valley\nfortunately the rain has stopped\nso not getting ped with rain at the\nmoment\neither well I've had my first commo\nchallenge the route wants me to go here\nI think those big wooden gates are\nsaying no you don't so I think we'll be\ncarrying on along the main road and\nhoping for a little left turn that would\nallow me to rejoin the route that I have\nplanned cuz I don't think I'm going\nthrough there reached the first Hill\nthat's defeated me having to push for a\nlittle bit up this steep bit of Hill my\nlegs weren't quite ready to ride up\nit well a load of climbing there that\nwas definitely beyond my legus pedal up\nwith the loaded Touring\nbike but some beautiful little quiet\ncountry lanes surrounded by Woodland and\nthen View new over the hills it's worth\nit just stopped off in the little\nvillage of hillo changed the GoPro\nbatteries grabbed some flapjack to eat\nand just have a breather for a moment\nbefore well I'm sure we'll be more Hills\nI'll slightly change the route that I\nwas going to do to stick to the B Road\nrather than the little country lanes for\na section just fancied some more easy\nrolling rather up down up down that the\nCountry Lane seem to entail and it's\nquite nice it's come through this lovely\nlittle\nvillage well just cutting back off the\nbe\n4391 cuz I'm not dropping right down\ninto Balor but cutting up and over the\nhill I think I'm about to find another\nsteep bit of climbing\nso might be a bit of walking about to\ncome up but the views I've been enjoying\nas i' been cycling along here have been\nfabulous over the mountains really been\nenjoying\nthat not so sure I'm enjoying the\nburning of my legs quite as much but\nit's good to be out I'm giving them a\ngood work\nout just stopping for a moment came\nacross this lovely Little River and\nthought I'd stop and enjoy a bit more\nFlapjack and refuel a bit before what I\nknow I've got coming up is quite a long\nclimb with some steep bits that I will\nprobably be walking up so enjoying the\ncalm waters before the\nstorm this climb is certainly a long one\nbit of a reprieve at the moment little\nflat section between the climbs\nall around me I can see\nmountains which in my mind means at some\npoint I've got to get to go up and over\nand out of these mountains hence all the\nclimbing but wow it's beautiful as\nwell definitely feeling the Wilds of\nWales now and I can see the road snaking\nahead of me and some cyclists coming the\nother way who've already faced the climb\nthe other side the first Cy nees past me\nI realized I got an ebike which right\nnow seems a very good idea wow that's\nlooking a tough climb up ahead\njust taking a little breather on my way\nup the hill Co it's tough but it is so\nfar ridable so I think it's got a last\nneed little kick towards the end so\nwe'll see whether we make it all the way\nwell over 1,000 ft above sea level here\nso really are doing quite a bit of\nclimbing I love this wild landscape here\nand bit below I could smile the Bracken\nwhich to me is a smile of\nwildness\nLov just to add to the challenges with\ncycling up here we're cycling to a\nheadwind and we're in the cloud as\nwell nothing makes it easy well I've\nmade it to the top I almost pedal all\nthe way up but the last little kicker\njust before the Finish ground me to a\nhalt so the last couple of hundred yards\nit was push my bike\nThe View up here up in the cloud is\namazing just surrounded by mountains and\nsheep basically and according to my\nGarmin I'm at over 1,600 ft above sea\nlevel so pretty high\nup now we start The Descent let's hope\nthe brakes are feeling good\nan amazing descent through a beautiful\nForest trying to make sure the brakes\nkeep me under control paying the benefit\nof all that uphill\nclimbing wow what did descent had to\nhang on to those breake leavs a bit on\nthe way down there at\ntimes but we've arrived at Lake\nBernie\nand the adrenaline's kicking in you can\nsee people's faces as well when I was\ndriving they were driving up or down\nthere and as I was cycling up it you\nthink you could tell they were thinking\nthis guy is nuts as I got to the top\nthere were two guys making their way up\non bikes as well e- mountain bikes they\nwere well impressed that I'd managed to\nget up there without the assistance of a\nmotor\nfabulous could do without that another\nbig clown like that though for a little\nwhile for my legs to recover cruising\nAlong by Lake burnway at the\nmoment can just about see it through the\ntrees at the side of me but it's a nice\nFlat Road here which is a nice change\nafter all the climbing recently so just\nenjoying gently pedling along for a bit\nthe reservoir is coming a bit more into\nview now and I can see the dam up\nahead and just past the tower which I'm\nsure has some significance in terms of\ncontrolling the water it's on here I\ncan't remember what it\nis well it may not have been on route\nbut I had to make the crossing across\nthe dam and appreciate the view down the\nreservoir back up we go and start\ncarrying on our route\nthese Hills do not relent another one\nthat I just had to walk\nup in fact I think I was almost crawling\nup it was so hard to push your bike the\nbike was desperate to try and roll back\ndown the hill again it really does make\nthis hard work the distance I've covered\ntoday nowhere near what I expected to\nhave done by now just cuz of these\nHills theyve put the bunting out for me\nhere just spotted a new Stone Circle I\ndon't think it's quite as old as\nStonehenge it's so still out here here\nnow all you hear is the birds chirping\nthe Sheep\nbarring and the bit of Breeze in the\ntrees\nbeautiful and my puffing and panting as\nI'm coming up the hills\nwell Kut has taken me on one of the more\ninteresting routes that it sometimes\ntakes you\non this is supposed to be cycle touring\na ball this I'm not going for bike\npacking cycle\ntouring not very ridable I don't think\nwe'll see how we get\non and we're out onto a gravel track\nthrough the deci side this is a bit\neasier we're back on tarmac come across\nsome log cabins and a golf course in the\nmiddle of nowhere as far as I'm aware\nwe made it to the top of that Hill bit\nof walking bit of cycling\n16% 16% down as well\nwe I've just arrived into New Town made\nit this is my target for the day minimum\ncourse it's been a tougher day than I\nexpected but I'm quite glad to get here\nand now just got to find somewhere to\nrefu my drink bottles maybe find\nsomething to eat and even better if I\ncan find somewhere to Camp not while\ncamping but somewhere with a shower be\neven better think I might have spotted\nsomewhere so we shall\nsee cycling through New Town I've just\nfound the place I\nspotted that can possibly host me\ntonight and they still open and they\nstill got some space so camp tonight and\nhopefully maybe even a shower and it's a\npub so maybe a nice cold pint as well\nfirst through New Town they' got the\nBunty out for me\nagain and I think I've got a bit of a\nhill to climb to get out of new town to\nget to where I'm going to be\ncamping yep there's a hill but it\ndoesn't matter when you know there's\ngoing to be somewhere at the end of\nit and here it is an rasis in a desert\nit feel like right\nnow glad to get\nhere quite liking this sign just\nhere grumpy old man ahead is that for me\nam I a grumpy old man I'm not feeling\ngrumpy right now to see\nthis right let's go and check in\ntent pitched and ready for the bed for\ntonight fabulous time at the dolly in\njust outside of New Town highly\nrecommended if you're looking for\nsomewhere to Camp really friendly team\ngreat food I had a fabulous Steak and\nAle pie and chips just what was needed\nand a couple of nice cold pints of cider\nperfect way to end the day great spot\nreally good value camping I think\nthey've only charged me a fiver and just\nlovely little spots a really friendly\nteam here had a lovely chat with some of\nthe locals and yeah just great one thing\nto note they only take cash or they can\ndo bank transfer which is what I had to\ndo it because I didn't have any cash\nwith me and I wasn't going to cycle back\ndown into new town right good night see\nyou in the morning for day three of the\nadventure\ngood morning and happy birthday to me I\nhave brought myself up a couple of\nbirthday cards to going to open in a\nmoment while I enjoy my morning coffee\nand Quon that I have with\nme but sun is shining and it's not\nraining so good start to the day not so\ngood news is we've got a big Steep Hill\nto climb to start with but time to enjoy\nmy coffee which I've just brewed up and\nopened my card for my\nbirthday thought I would bring as I'm on\na cycle tour riding some long distances\nI thought i' bring the car that's\ntraveled to furthest from my sister in\nTanzania and there's my\ncard happy birthday to my favorite\nbrother though I will point out I am her\nonly brother so she can safely say\nthat happy birthday to\nme bike is locked and loaded p is all on\nready to go time to go time to start\nriding up those Hills\nagain not done a mile yet but we're\nalready pushing the bike partly cuz re\nhaven't warmed up at all you literally\nstraight into the climb so and partly\njust cuz it's steep fortunately the\nsteep steep section didn't last too long\nso I'm back on the bike trundling my way\nslowly up the hill as the views open up\naround me of the hills around\nabout and still we climb over 2 and 1\nhalf miles of climbing since we left the\ncampsite definitely making the legs burn\nto start the\nday that's the top reached and just look\nat this\nview just taking a moment for a breather\nhaving reached the top of the hill\nproviding spectator sport I think for\nthe cows and sheep here the Sheep at\nthis time of year always amused me\nslightly the sheep have been sha the\nLambs haven't so actually the Lambs are\nnow bigger than their moms but still\ngoing in for a suckle of milk quite\nfunny oh the Vista spread out around me\nis just\nfabulous absolutely loving\nthis well well after a\nbeautiful fairly quick but steady\ndescent on the road after my first long\nclimb we're back pushing the bike up a\nhill again turned off the a road just\nthere and a short sharp climb to kick\nthe legs off which my leg said no thanks\nwe're walking but I think it's only a\nlittle one\nwell a little undulating back road for a\nwhile and now we're back on the a44 so a\nbit of a-road cycling again now which\ntends to be a bit easier on the legs but\nnot quite as fun and pleasant perhaps as\nthe back road combination of two works\nwell today my legs are definitely a\nweary one of the things I was perhaps\nexpecting when cycling through Wales a\nbit bit more open landscape um sort of\nMs or hills around me what I've actually\nended up cycling on a lot of is little\ncountry lanes with high Hedges and high\nbanks on either side which sometimes\nmeans un fortunately you don't get to\nsee much of the view the lane I'm\ncycling up at the moment is a case in\npoint I'm sure there are beautiful\nmountains round about me all I can see\nis the Hedge lovely Lanes slightly\nchallenging when you have a tractor\ncomeing towards you you need to dive for\ncover there is barely space for them to\nsqueeze past you but more like almost\nbut like I get back home in South War\nshow and into the cotw some of these\nnarrow Lanes with high Hedges and also\nthat you find down in Devon and Cornwall\nnot quite what I expecting Wells but you\nknow beautiful nonetheless well we have\nbroken out of some of those High Banks\nand hedges and all a sudden the mountain\nviews are there round about me\nbeautiful well we have come out into\nsome more open warland after to my\nearlier comments it says if it heard me\nand is delivered on promise so I'm now\nup on the MS in the\nmountains no high Hedges can enjoy the\nviews if the cows were enjoying the view\nof me climbing up the hill as well\nlooking at me as if to say You must be\ncrazy sorry Dad\njoke all I can hear is the core and the\nchir of birds sheep barring the\noccasional cow mooing and in one case a\nball I think was get slightly upset that\nI was anywhere\nnearby but other than that\nnothing peace\nI have seen a lot of the ncn routes as\nI've been cycling around up here on\nthese little country lanes now Sr thing\nis for their roots to be part of the\nnational psych Network it has to be\nridable by a competent 12-year-old\nbecause they shouldn't be too busy with\ntraffic and I can assure you these roads\nare not too busy with traffic but the\n12-year-old would have to have legs of\nSteel to R ride some of these\nHills I was trundling along and it's\ngetting well past 3:00 and I thinking I\ncould really do with a spot of lunch I\nthought it was going to be resulting to\njust my Flapjack that I've got in my paa\nfor my lunch and then spotted erwood\nCafe which is an Old Railway Station all\nthat's left of it is the railway station\nand an old train sitting outside of it\nand as well there's a carriage that you\ncan sit in and have your lunch if you\nwanted to but on a day like had to sit\noutside absolutely lovely little spot\nand had a delicious cheese breakfast s\ntoasted\nsandwich that was just hit the spot\nalong with a beautiful piece of sticky\nSt toffee and Biscoff cake Perfection\nsticky toffee and Biscoff combined you\ncouldn't ask for more hopefully that's\nrefueled the batteries for the next 20\nmiles of cycling not far to go now still\na bit of undulation though doing the\nlast little section of it though I think\nso not going to be easy cycling along\nthe valley at the moment so it's nice\nand flat just following the river and\nI'm guessing actually based on where the\nstation was and where the line of this\nroad is we may well be cycling along the\nOld Railway line even though it is\nactually now Road not just a trail how's\nthat sort of feel about it nice easy\ngradient and the way the the banks fall\naway and everything\nbut\nlovely just arriving into Breen National\nPark Breen\nbeacons remember climbing penan when I\nwas much much\nyounger and I've got a few Hills to\nclimb on the bike instead\njust passing by clangor Lake on my right\nat the moment just about 5 miles away\nnow from my final destination for\ntonight surrounded by\nmountains but fortunately I don't think\nI've got many more to climb in the rest\nof the journey but there\nnow and there's a kite hovering above me\nnow oh beautiful\na very narrow bridge to finish my\nride good morning fourth and final day\nof my tour and I'm starting off with\nsome very easy cycling along the canal\ntow path it's lovely and\nflat but um lovely last night stay with\nwith friends catch up good leather and\ntoday I think we got one significant\nHill to\ndo uh up and\nover um sort of the Breen area I guess\nbut I think it's along an old rway line\nso actually the gradient won't be too\nhorrendous for most of it I'm led to\nbelieve so hoping that's the case but\nI'm going to make the most of this Canal\nbit to warm my legs up nicely and get\nthem going for the\nday certainly an easier start than\nyesterday when we were straight into the\nclimbing so we're off the canal toe path\nnow at a little swing bridge and now\nheading towards the reservoir where\nwe're going to cross over a dam I\nbelieve\ncrossing over my second Reservoir Dam of\nthe trip talibon Reservoir and then I'm\njoining the Taff Trail um for the next\npart of my route which is the old R line\nwhich I've been assured by my friend\nlast night is a nice steady incline as\nbehests a rway line so I'm hoping they\nweren't fiing sure they\nweren't but what a beautiful view down\nthe\nreservoir this morning\nso riding along the TA Trail now which\nis a steady upward incline with the\nreservoir on the side of me on my right\nnot that I can see much of it at the\nmoment between the trees and it does\ngradually go\nupwards enough to make you puff and pant\nbut not enough to make my legs stop all\ntogether so all good\nI finished the climb up the Taft Trail\ngravel path all the way up into the from\nthe valley below now surrounded by\nmountains and up on the hillside above\nme I can see some sheep being moved and\nI hear the call of the shepherd and the\nwhistle to the dogs working the Sheep I\njoined the road for a bit now bit\nsmoother the tough travel is great but\ndefinitely more suited to slightly\nfatter TP tires and softer tires than\nI'm riding on a Touring bike perhaps and\ndefinitely if you're descending down\nthere you'd probably value some front\nsuspension I can feel the pins and\nneedles in my hands and that's with the\nsteady riding uphill upit so definitely\nif you wanted to let let go and go for\nit down there you definitely want\nsomething with some decent tires and\nsome front fork suspension at the least\nto make the most of it but great way to\nget up here definitely better than the\nroads cuz it is just a steady grind\nAscent without ever getting too Steep\nand lovely to be traffic free the entire\nway I haven't seen a soul for the whole\njourney 7 and 1 half miles since leaving\nthe canal tow path and it's been a\nsteady climb ever since so be glad to do\nsome descending put a an extra layer on\ncuz it's quite chilly up here so on The\nDescent I'm definely going to feel the\nchill and I can see the road snaking\naway down below me now so let's get\ndescending\nwow that was a lovely bit of descent and\nI just passed owl's Grove I must come\nand visit that sometime with her love of\nowls we back off the road back onto the\nTaff Trail but it's now a Tarmac surface\nand it's downhill not uphill so we going\nto enjoy this 20 mes to on pleas\nthis is just fantastic a beautiful\nsteady descent tarma surface traffic\nfree but I hav to see people\nagain over 10 m cycle this morning we\nfact over 15 miles this morning didn't\nreally see anybody all of a sudden we're\nstarting to get back into habitation\nthere's people out walking their dogs\nother people out on their bikes they're\nsuffering going up the other way and\nyeah but absolutely fabulous Trail\ndefinitely one to come back perhaps and\ndo with the children sometimes it's\nreally family friendly though the other\nside is definitely a bit more\nchallenging I was warned as I came into\nM tidf that I'd find some sort of\nchanges ins sign of the route they've\nactually it looks like they've now\nfinished the new bridge over the new\nroad that they're building or jeweling\nthe roads that's there um so that was a\nlot easier perhaps than I was expecting\nto get around that little bit and into M\ndid well\nmorning over an amazing Viaduct just\nthere fabulous views from that and\ncarrying on down the TA Trail loving\nthis traffic fre\ncycling just passing by the old Iron\nWorks in\nrville and all that's left really of it\nincredible Heritage in that area\nimpressive construction though\nwow after so many days of cycling\nthrough valleys country lanes little\nVillages and all the rest of it it's\nquite weird to be back in a urban\nenvironment and just being surrounded by\nbuildings cars and all the rest of it\nthat goes through\nthat still on traffic free cycling\nheading to w p Prest still we're now on\nthe travic trail rather than the Taff\nTrail I'm heading down the valley so the\nvalley is down there below me we're\nsteadily dropping every now and then you\nget a little lump have to get the legs\nworking a bit harder but most of the\ntime it's pretty easygoing\ncycling 7 miles to Pont P now just past\nmale train station\nback on the tap Trail and no longer on\ntarmak either back on the more grally\nStony\nsurface so bit more vibration to deal\nwith but a lovely Trail nonetheless\ncarrying on down the valley with the\nriver down below\nme cycling right by the side of the\nriver now so dropped all the way down to\nthe river level\nthe hills up the other side of\nit in the park in Pont P last time I was\nhere it was to do park run for the\ncowest Meetup so it's nice to be back\nbit easier cycling through it than it\nwas running through it I'm having slight\nchallenges however the nationalized dead\nfod here and the route is closed off so\ntrying to navigate my way through the\npark slight change of plan for the last\npart of my ride not quite going to make\nit to the southernmost point of\nWales cuz I've just run out of time got\nto the F locked in the park in Pont P um\nfirst of all got sort of push war\nDirection by the people who are working\non setting up for the ice dead pod and\nthen got about half a mile along the\nRoute and there was a gate across the\npath completely locked um no way around\nit no way over it nothing\nso back to the office in the park found\na man with a van with the\nkeys um who then had to come all the way\nto the gate unlock it for me and so I\ncould continue on my way on the TA Trail\nbut by that point any margin I got left\nwhich would have allowed me to get to\nwhere I was hoping to get to and then\nget to Cardiff to catch my train had\ndisappeared and looking at the following\ntrains it would be a complete pain\ntrying to c a different train so decided\nto be sensible for once in my life and\njust head direct to Cardiff on the TA\nTrail which is a very nice way to do it\nso enjoying it but just not quite\nachieve what I was hoping\nfor well it's been interesting so far\nobviously because I'm no longer\nfollowing my actual route I'm just\nrelying on the signage for the Taff\nTrail got to point just back there and\nthe sign for Cardiff wasn't there so I\nstarted heading towards capil which I\nthen thought no I'm not sure this is\nright so had a quick look at my Google\nMaps and sure enough heading in the\nwrong direction the other interesting\nthing is the distances bounced up and\ndown like a yo-yo one saying 10 miles\nnext minute 8 Miles and so on and so\nforth\nso who knows how far it is to\nCardiff the good thing having made my\ndecision that I couldn't get through I\nwas getting a bit stressed about whether\nI was going to make it and oh really\nwanting to but then you know what do you\ndo and wanting to see my family and get\nback to them as well I know that they\nwould have been disappointed if I hadn't\ngot back to be able to see them before\nthey go to bed\ntonight so once having made the decision\nrelaxed now I can make it to card if\neasily on this route and just nice to\nenjoy the last bit of a ride in a more\nrelaxed fashion decisions you make while\nyou're\ntouring sometimes you just have to be\nsensible\nseeing all the blue stickers marking\nRoute 8 of the national cycle Network\nthat I'm cycling along otherwise known\nas the TA Trail in this part um reminds\nme of the book I've been reading Laura\nof Laura Lakers Pooles and Pavements\nwhen she talks about the army of\nvolunteers going out each year to make\nsure the stickers are in place for\nfinding your way but also the fairly hit\nand miss nature of their signage and\nsometimes you could desperately do with\none and there's just nothing around and\nothers times they're everywhere but\nmostly I'm managing to find my way\nwithout the age of my Garin directing me\non my\npath just past one of the cycle networks\nof of metal Millennium signs as well CU\none of the things they wanted to do is\nnot just create spaces for us to cycle\nand walk along but also to have them as\nplaces of enjoyment and pleasure and\nthey thought sculpture and art along the\nRoute was a key part of that so hence\nwhy you see so much of that along the\nsran\nRoute well without even realizing it\nI've arrived into the suburbs of Cardiff\nit's so green and leafy by the actual\ncycle route you don't even realize but I\nhad begun to wonder cuz i' seen so many\nmore cyclist Runners people out walking\njust enjoying the sustr route so I had\nguessed I must be getting into urban\narea but absolutely beautiful way of\nheading into the city you would never\nknow look at this spread out here just\npeeking over the trees you can see the\nodd tall building and so on that\nobviously marks the fact we are into the\ncity quite glad in some ways that I've\ncome this way rather than my original\nplan route to have experienced the whole\nof the TA Trail definitely one I'll be\nback and doing I think with the children\nif I can work out way of perhaps not\nmaking them do too much uphill and as\nmuch of the downhill as\npossible this is my first ever time in\nCardiff itself so quite enjoying cycling\nthrough not that I'm see much of the\ncity but I'm seen lots of lovely Green\nSpace that is alongside the river and so\non and some great cycle INF structure as\nwell so loving it so far definite thumbs\nup for\nme well I've made it to my revised Final\nDestination\nCardiff Bay as a Martin Joseph fan had\nto be here I've made it from one coast\nof Wales the North Coast to the South\nCoast maybe not quite to the most suly\npoint but I still feel I've achieved My\noverall ambition hope you've enjoyed\ntoday's little Adventure well a few days\nadventure maybe slightly bigger than a\nlittle Adventure if you've enjoyed this\nadventure then do make sure you hit\nsubscribe because coming up I've got a\ncycle touring adventure with Yan in the\nNetherlands and a little cycle touring\nadventure with owner as well over the\nsummer holidays and do check out this\nvideo of my last year's cycle tour with\nYan as well down there in Norfolk bit\nflatter than it was through Wales see\nyou on another little Adventure soon bye\nfor now bye",
