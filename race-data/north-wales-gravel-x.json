At that intensity, finishing 3rd meant the distance separates fitness levels but doesn't provide the suffer-fest length that breaks weekend warriors from serious racers. More compact than Grinduro."

      "technicality": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "The course opens with \"a tight and punchy little 10% climb\" after the dam wall, then delivers what Jon in Sweden called descents with \"technical cornering and rough terrain\" that weren't \"too steep, but fairly twisty.\" Standard gravel tires (35-45mm) handle the terrain, but the mix challenges bike handling skills. Similar technical demands to Gravel Worlds."

        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "1,500m over 78km delivers consistent climbing without being gratuitously brutal. The punchy climbs through Clocaenog Forest and rolling terrain around the reservoirs create varied elevation challenges. Not Alpine suffering, but enough vertical to separate the prepared from the optimistic across relatively short distance. Similar elevation profile to Gravel Worlds. As Jon in Sweden puts it: \"The descents on the other side were almost designed for me with them being not too steep, but fairly twisty, with technical cornering and rough terrain.\""
      },

        "explanation": "Jon in Sweden experienced \"intermittent showers and 30kph wind\" with temperatures of \"16-17c\" in April 2024, calling it \"miserable weather really.\" The evening rain made tracks wet for race day, typical of North Wales spring conditions that demand four-season kit regardless of forecast. More weather exposure than Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."
      },
      "altitude": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "The course runs around Welsh reservoirs and through Clocaenog Forest at negligible elevation. No altitude considerations affect performance or require acclimatization - sea-level fitness translates directly to course demands. Lower altitude than Gravel Worlds — no thin-air concerns."
      },
      "adventure": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Circuits of Llyn Alwen and Llyn Brenig through Clocaenog Forest deliver North Wales wilderness experience. The mix of reservoirs, technical forest climbs, and remote gravel roads takes you properly away from civilization. Not epic multi-day adventure, but real backcountry riding that reminds you why Welsh terrain built hard riders. As Official Event Description puts it: \"This is wild, remote & scenic gravel riding but all within 2 hours of Birmingham, Manchester & Liverpool. Camp over for a great gravel weekend including a club ride in Eryri National Park on Sunday.\""

However, Jon in Sweden's 3rd place finish shows the competitive field remains regional level despite the UCI connection."

        "explanation": "Jon in Sweden noted seeing \"literally dozens of guys at the side of the road covered in sealant\" from mechanical failures, while his own chain \"sneaked past the catcher and came off\" by 13km. The course delivers proper terrain through Clocaenog Forest, but mechanical support appears stretched across remote sections."

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Tim o's son \"loved every minute of it\" despite starting at the back and riding solo for the first half. The course provides checkpoints every 30-40km with \"tea, coffee and cake at the first feed and sandwiches & crisps at the main feed,\" but riders need self-sufficiency across the remote reservoir sections."

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Riders gather for \"a beer & food available from our food truck\" at the finish with camping available onsite at GYG Karting.

      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Registration runs £70-90. Two hours from Birmingham, Manchester, and Liverpool means rental car costs plus rural North Wales accommodation. Jon in Sweden's Canyon Grizl SL6 with SRAM Apex XPLR and Schwalbe 2.1\" tires shows serious equipment investment pays off, but the remote location adds travel complexity beyond the entry fee. Higher total cost than Badlands."
