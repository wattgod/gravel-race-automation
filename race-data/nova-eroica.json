        "explanation": "JOM called it 'one of my best days on a bicycle' after completing the 95km route, suggesting the organization delivers despite small-town Italian infrastructure. The festival atmosphere in Buonconvento works well for the day-before walkabout and post-race scene."
      },
      "length": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "84 miles with timed segments on Monte Sante Marie and San Martino creates the perfect balance—long enough for proper suffering, structured enough to race when you want. JOM's group rode tempo between timed sectors, 'enjoying the food stops and scenery.'"
      },
      "technicality": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "The course uses famous Strade Bianche sectors including Monte Sante Marie, but 2025 photos show 'steep grade, loose conditions, everyone walking' on descents. Classic Tuscan gravel that challenges through distance and climbing, not technical handling skills."

      "climate": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Weather runs the gamut—2021 saw 'cooler temperatures and a very light drizzle' instead of typical July heat, while 2025 had 'storms nearby' that 'blew through quickly.' Italian spring delivers 'filtered sun and misted gravel' when it cooperates."
      },
      "altitude": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Rolling Tuscan hills sit comfortably at sea level elevations. The challenge comes from cumulative climbing and distance, not oxygen deprivation. Altitude simply isn't a factor in the Val d'Orcia."
      },
      "adventure": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Racing the same sectors as Fabian Cancellara through 'abundant vineyards and steep sterrate' delivers adventure wrapped in cycling history. The course reaches places cars can't, through landscapes that have looked the same for centuries."
      },
      "prestige": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Using the actual Strade Bianche sectors gives this race cycling pedigree that matters. JOM managed 'the initial front group of 20 or so' and finished 'with the top cyclists,' suggesting the field takes it seriously despite the festival atmosphere."
      },
      "race_quality": {
        "score": 5,
        "explanation": "Perfect execution of the Eroica formula—84 miles through Tuscan countryside without the tourist trap bullshit. The organization knows what they're doing because they've been doing it right elsewhere. When the course delivers 9,186 feet of climbing through actual working farmland, not Instagram backdrop nonsense, that's race quality."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 5,
        "explanation": "The combination of 'gourmet food, wine, and the culture of Italy, provides a cycling experience that is like no other.' Aid stations overflow with Italian specialties while you're grinding through the same hills that define professional cycling."
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 4,

      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "JOM found himself racing with 'the initial front group of 20 or so' and finishing 'with the top cyclists' on the long route. The field attracts riders serious enough to push the pace on timed sectors while respecting the festival spirit."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 5,
        "explanation": "Access to iconic Strade Bianche sectors combined with Italian aid stations featuring wine and gourmet food creates exceptional value. The 'wonderful and inclusive day out on the bike' delivers cycling history, culture, and community in one package."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Tuscany tourist pricing affects everything from hotels to meals, and getting to Buonconvento requires Italian travel logistics. Riders showed up on everything from 'Sweet drop bar Klein MTB conversions' to high-end steel, suggesting varied budget approaches work."

    "final_verdict": {
      "score": "74 / 100",
      "one_liner": "Tuscany's gravel answer to L'Eroica that trades vintage wool for modern suffering on the same unforgiving strade bianche.",
      "should_you_race": "You need legitimate climbing legs for 9,186 feet of Tuscan punishment and the bike handling skills to descend white gravel roads that turn sketchy fast. This isn't a beginner's intro to European gravel—it's proper suffering in postcard scenery. Show up undertrained and those rolling hills will expose every fitness gap you've been ignoring.",
      "alternatives": "L'Eroica gives you the same Tuscan strade bianche with vintage bike requirements and more prestige, while Strade Bianche Eroica delivers similar terrain with better organization and clearer logistics. Both spare you the mystery of what exactly you're signing up for."
