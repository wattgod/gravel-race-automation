        "explanation": "55 miles sits in that awkward middle distance where it's too short to be epic and too long to be casual. Four route options from 20-100 miles show they're trying to please everyone, which usually means pleasing no one particularly well. At least you can pick your poison."

        "explanation": "2500 feet over 55 miles averages to manageable suffering in Driftless region terrain.

        "score": 1,

        "explanation": "Leslie Johnson enjoyed \"a true gravel experience highlighting MN rolling farmland, barns and bluff views\" while Jeanne Fricke called it \"one of the prettiest rides I've ever done.\" The Driftless terrain offers \"spectacular views\" with \"wide open to wooded descents\" and minimal pavement once riders reach the ridge system."

        "explanation": "Ryan Greene, who \"raced all over this year everything from Midsouth to Montana to Steamboat,\" noted \"the only thing lacking was some organization and that big finish line feel\" compared to established events.

      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "The farm venue provides a \"cool old structure with a rustic feel\" barn as event center with post-ride \"food, drink, and hangs with new friends.\" Erin Sullivan appreciated being able to \"sleep in my car in the pasture\" due to high hotel costs, while Phil Solberg had a \"great experience\" for his first gravel ride."

      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "The 100-mile field shows modest competitive depth with winners around 4:44 and mid-pack finishing 2-3 hours later. Brian Werner's enthusiastic but generic review (\"the venue was great, the route was great, the vendors were great\") reflects a friendly participation-focused field rather than serious racing depth."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Four distance options, professional timing, food, drinks, and supporting local causes for an undisclosed but presumably reasonable entry fee delivers solid bang for buck. You're getting a organized event experience without the premium pricing of established races. Sometimes being nobody's first choice makes you everybody's good deal."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Hokah represents modest Midwest travel costs with car camping available in the farm pasture as Erin Sullivan utilized. Local business partnerships for food and lodging in what organizers call a \"super cool little town\" keep costs reasonable compared to destination race weekend gouging."
