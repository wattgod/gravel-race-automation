Less technical than The Mid South."

        "explanation": "Southeast Minnesota's Driftless region sits at typical elevations of 800-1400 feet with no altitude training considerations.

Brian Werner's enthusiastic but generic review (\"the venue was great, the route was great, the vendors were great\") reflects a friendly participation-focused field rather than serious racing depth. Thinner field than Ouray Gravel Grinder."

        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Four distance options, professional timing, food, drinks, and supporting local causes for an undisclosed but presumably reasonable entry fee delivers solid bang for buck. You're getting a organized event experience without the premium pricing of established races. Sometimes being nobody's first choice makes you everybody's good deal."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Registration runs $50-75. Hokah represents modest Midwest travel costs with car camping available in the farm pasture as Erin Sullivan utilized. Local business partnerships for food and lodging in what organizers call a \"super cool little town\" keep costs reasonable compared to destination race weekend gouging. Similar expense level to Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."
