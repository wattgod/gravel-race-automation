The course offers 25 and 50-mile options with ride leaders for beginners, while the 100-mile distance conquers over 7,000 feet of climbing for those wanting a full day out. More compact than Grinduro."

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Holly Springs National Forest terrain features 'rolling hills, fun descents, gorgeous forest views and well-packed gravel service roads.'

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "January weather proved memorable in 2021 when Bart Luther noted 'Having snowflakes in Mississippi was a bonus!' Multiple team DNFs in 2024 suggest conditions can turn challenging quickly. January timing avoids summer humidity but brings winter weather uncertainty to the Deep South. More weather exposure than Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

Holly Springs National Forest provides 'gorgeous forest views' through well-maintained gravel roads, offering scenic exploration without extreme technical challenges."
      },
      "prestige": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Opens the Mississippi Gravel Cup series with limited regional recognition. The 2021 field was capped at 160 riders due to COVID, and while the event draws some out-of-state participation, it remains largely invisible on the national gravel calendar."
      },
      "race_quality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Organizers provided 'Premium swag, a sick finishers patch' even during COVID restrictions. Aid stations offer water, sports drink and snacks plus post-race meals. Jason Shearer noted riders 'signed up in minutes' when registration opened, indicating solid execution that keeps people coming back."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Bart Luther observed 'Seeing all the smiles, seeing all the exhilaration, I think sometimes competition is good for the soul.' The event offers podium prizes three deep across multiple categories including Clydesdale/Athena, Sexagenarian, and Singlespeed divisions to accommodate different rider types."
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Jason Shearer emphasized the series goal: 'We're really proud to bring people into our Mississippi communities and experience Mississippi on two wheels.' Even with COVID restrictions requiring masked volunteers and individually packaged snacks, the community atmosphere remained welcoming with 'fist bumps and socially distanced air hugs.'"
      },

        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Scott Kuppersmith won the 100-mile elite division in 5:24:37.9 in 2025, showing some competitive depth. However, multiple Marx-Bensdorf/BPC Cycling Team riders DNF'd after strong first laps in 2024, suggesting the field lacks consistent national-level depth despite regional competition. Thinner field than Ouray Gravel Grinder."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Entry fee isn't listed but Mississippi races typically run reasonable. 50 miles for probably under $75 beats getting gouged by the big-name events. Just don't expect much beyond basic course support for your money."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Registration runs $65-85. Oxford is a college town with reasonable lodging options, and Mississippi generally keeps costs manageable. The January date likely helps with accommodation availability and pricing. No major airport means driving, but regional access keeps travel costs reasonable for most participants. Similar expense level to Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."
