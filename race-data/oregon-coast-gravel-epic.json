The 150-rider field cap keeps it intimate, but that also means nobody outside Oregon knows it exists. Being part of the Oregon Triple Crown Series gives it some local street cred, but that's about where the prestige ends."

        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Mudslinger Events delivers solid basics—mass start at 9am from Waldport Community Center, three distance options, and OBRA sanctioning with proper age groups. Post-race includes DJ entertainment and $14 food vouchers, which beats standing around a parking lot. The 60-mile Abomination route through Siuslaw National Forest logging roads is legitimate suffering, just don't expect production value beyond functional."

      "experience": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Pure logging roads through ancient Siuslaw National Forest deliver the raw Oregon coast experience without Instagram polish. The 150-rider cap creates that personal, supportive vibe where you're not just another number grinding through aid stations. Awards ceremony timing varies by distance (1:30pm short, 2:30pm long), so you're not waiting around forever to see if you podiumed."
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "The Oregon Triple Crown Series connection means you'll see the same faces across multiple events, building actual relationships beyond race day small talk. Team competition on the Abomination route adds tribal dynamics, with top three teams getting custom awards plus free entries. At 150 riders max, it feels more like a club ride that got serious than a corporate gravel circus."
      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Capped at 150 riders and zero mention of any notable winners or elite fields means you're racing against weekend warriors and Oregon locals. The multiple age groups (15-24 through 75+) spread the competition thin across categories. If you're hunting for deep competitive fields or benchmark performances, this isn't your hunting ground."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Individual pricing isn't listed, but Oregon Triple Crown Series passes range from $337.50 to $562.50 for multiple events, suggesting reasonable per-race costs. Custom medals for all divisions, podium pint glasses, and that $14 food voucher add tangible value beyond just a finish line. Free entry next year for overall champions sweetens the deal if you're actually fast."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Waldport isn't exactly a destination resort town, so lodging and food costs won't murder your wallet like they would in Bend or Hood River. The coastal Oregon location means driving distance for most PNW riders, keeping travel costs reasonable. No specific airport or lodging details in the research, but small coastal towns typically mean basic accommodations at basic prices."
      },
      "length": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "The 60-mile Abomination route hits that sweet spot where you're properly worked but not destroyed for the week. Three distance options (37, 49, 60 miles) let you pick your poison based on current fitness or masochistic tendencies. It's substantial enough to matter without requiring a training camp to survive."
      },
      "technicality": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Pure logging roads with \"stout hills\" and rolling steep sections require skill but won't destroy your derailleur hanger. Minimum 38mm tire recommendation (35mm if you're skilled and conditions are damp) suggests technical enough terrain to punish poor line choice. It's gravel bike or hardtail MTB territory—no roadie crossover nonsense."
      },
      "elevation": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "6,677 feet of climbing over 60 miles through Siuslaw National Forest logging roads will absolutely wreck you if you're not prepared. Those \"seriously stout hills\" aren't just marketing speak—this is legitimate vertical punishment disguised as a coastal ride. The elevation gain density makes every mile count, with nowhere to hide on exposed logging roads."
      },
      "climate": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "May on the Oregon coast means you're gambling with weather gods who change their minds hourly. The research mentions riding \"with caution if damp,\" which translates to slippery logging roads and potential hypothermia if conditions turn. No specific weather incidents noted, but coastal Oregon in spring is notoriously unpredictable."
      },
      "altitude": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Starting from sea-level Waldport means altitude isn't a factor for performance or acclimatization. The 6,677 feet refers to total elevation gain, not altitude above sea level, so your lungs won't be screaming from thin air. This is pure leg-burning climbing, not oxygen debt management."
      },
      "logistics": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Friday packet pickup 3-6pm or Saturday morning until 8:30am at Waldport Community Center covers the basics but offers zero flexibility for travel complications. No airport, lodging, or parking details means you're figuring out the infrastructure puzzle yourself. Small coastal town logistics work fine until they don't, and there's no backup plan mentioned."
      },
      "adventure": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Ancient Siuslaw National Forest logging roads through \"raw beauty\" deliver legitimate backcountry gravel without the sanitized rail-trail experience. You're deep enough in the woods that mechanical failures or weather turns get interesting quickly. The Oregon coast setting adds scenic value, but this is working forest roads, not postcard tourism."
