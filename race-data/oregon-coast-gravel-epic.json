The pre-race briefing warns riders they might end up \"becoming a human kite in monster cross-winds, sinking in a gravel slurry mix of wheel sucking quicksand, getting t-boned by a nice retiree backing out of their driveway,\" according to Mielle Blomberg's race report. Small coastal town logistics work until they don't."

Elite rider Shawn Petersen finished Day 1 in 3:51:25, noting \"The first climb was full gas\" before getting dropped on the second climb. Multiple distance options (37, 49, 60 miles) let riders pick their poison, with a hard cutoff at Aid Station Alpha (mile 14) at 11:30am for continuing on the long loop. Similar distance to Crusher in the Tushar."

        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "The opening \"30% grade punch\" immediately breaks chains and creates selection, as Mielle Blomberg witnessed a rider's chain snap \"2 pedal strokes\" into the race. The descent after Aid Station 1 features \"rough, thick gravel with tight sweeping corners and little room for error\" with a sharp left turn that nearly put Blomberg \"in the weeds.\" Official guidance recommends 38mm tires minimum, with \"3/4 inch and larger gravel for 65% of the course.\" Similar technical demands to Gravel Worlds."
      },
      "elevation": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "The final climb alone spans \"almost 10 miles\" starting at mile 44, which Blomberg describes as \"Up, with more ups, out of the saddle ups, low back screaming ups.\" Elite rider Shawn Petersen tackled 7,500 feet over 57 miles on Day 1, cramping hard with one mile to go despite being in podium position. The sustained climbing through Siuslaw National Forest logging roads offers no recovery sections. More climbing than SBT GRVL at the same score."

Blomberg's race started at 52°F before rain arrived \"right on time about 30 minutes in\" and \"continued for over 4 hours\" with 15-20 mph headwinds. The 2024 event saw \"well over 2 inches of rain\" described as \"rainfall of biblical proportions,\" while 2025 was noted as \"a rare sunny weekend\" on the coast. More weather exposure than Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."
      },
      "altitude": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Starting from sea-level Waldport means altitude plays no role in performance or acclimatization. The 5,000+ feet of elevation gain refers to cumulative climbing, not altitude above sea level, so oxygen debt isn't a factor. This is pure leg-burning punishment through coastal forest logging roads without the complication of thin air. Modest altitude compared to Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

        "explanation": "Started around 2013, now in its 12th year as part of Oregon Triple Crown Series, but remains a regional affair with 150-rider field caps. The most notable participant mentioned is 82-year-old Charles Mahaffy of Coos Bay who finished the long route in 2022. No elite fields or notable pro riders appear in race reports, keeping it firmly in weekend warrior territory."

        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Mudslinger Events delivers solid execution with humorous course signage including \"Are you swearing like a sailor yet?\" and the final \"IT'S ALL OVER BUT THE CRYING.\" Ham radio support from Lincoln County Auxiliary Communication Service covers the remote forest sections. Hard cutoffs at aid stations (11:30am at mile 14, 2pm at mile 31) keep the event moving efficiently through challenging logistics."
      },
      "experience": {

The combination of ancient Siuslaw National Forest logging roads and Yachats River vistas creates memorable suffering."

Elite rider Shawn Petersen competed in a separate category, finishing 3 minutes ahead of 5th place—\"a guy who's beat me before at the line.\" The deepest competition comes from Oregon Triple Crown Series regulars who race multiple events annually. Less competitive depth than Almanzo 100."

Custom medals for all finishers, podium pint glasses, and DeFeet Merino wool socks (\"the best socks PERIOD\") add tangible value. Winners receive free entry the following year, with 50% discounts for 2nd and 3rd overall finishers."

        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Registration runs $80-100. Coastal Waldport keeps accommodation costs reasonable compared to destination resort towns like Bend. Multiple riders mention the need for proper tire selection—Blomberg's 35mm file treads \"served me really well\" while avoiding the \"6 riders with flats in the first 5 miles.\" Elite rider Petersen noted \"Need bigger tires—descents were loose and sketchy\" after both race days. Similar expense level to Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."
