The pre-race briefing warns riders they might end up \"becoming a human kite in monster cross-winds, sinking in a gravel slurry mix of wheel sucking quicksand, getting t-boned by a nice retiree backing out of their driveway,\" according to Mielle Blomberg's race report.

Elite rider Shawn Petersen finished Day 1 in 3:51:25, noting \"The first climb was full gas\" before getting dropped on the second climb. Multiple distance options (37, 49, 60 miles) let riders pick their poison, with a hard cutoff at Aid Station Alpha (mile 14) at 11:30am for continuing on the long loop. Similar distance to Crusher in the Tushar."

        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "The opening \"30% grade punch\" immediately breaks chains and creates selection, as Mielle Blomberg witnessed a rider's chain snap \"2 pedal strokes\" into the race. The descent after Aid Station 1 features \"rough, thick gravel with tight sweeping corners and little room for error\" with a sharp left turn that nearly put Blomberg \"in the weeds.\" Official guidance recommends 38mm tires minimum, with \"3/4 inch and larger gravel for 65% of the course.\" Similar technical demands to Gravel Worlds."
      },
      "elevation": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "The final climb alone spans \"almost 10 miles\" starting at mile 44, which Blomberg describes as \"Up, with more ups, out of the saddle ups, low back screaming ups.\" Elite rider Shawn Petersen tackled 7,500 feet over 57 miles on Day 1, cramping hard with one mile to go despite being in podium position. The sustained climbing through Siuslaw National Forest logging roads offers no recovery sections. More climbing than SBT GRVL at the same score."

Blomberg's race started at 52°F before rain arrived \"right on time about 30 minutes in\" and \"continued for over 4 hours\" with 15-20 mph headwinds. The 2024 event saw \"well over 2 inches of rain\" described as \"rainfall of biblical proportions,\" while 2025 was noted as \"a rare sunny weekend\" on the coast. More weather exposure than Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."
      },
      "altitude": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Starting from sea-level Waldport means altitude plays no role in performance or acclimatization. The 5,000+ feet of elevation gain refers to cumulative climbing, not altitude above sea level, so oxygen debt isn't a factor. This is pure leg-burning punishment through coastal forest logging roads without the complication of thin air. Modest altitude compared to Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

The most notable participant mentioned is 82-year-old Charles Mahaffy of Coos Bay who finished the long route in 2022. No elite fields or notable pro riders appear in race reports, keeping it firmly in weekend warrior territory."

        "explanation": "Mudslinger Events delivers solid execution with humorous course signage including \"Are you swearing like a sailor yet?\" and the final \"IT'S ALL OVER BUT THE CRYING.\" Ham radio support from Lincoln County Auxiliary Communication Service covers the remote forest sections. Hard cutoffs at aid stations (11:30am at mile 14, 2pm at mile 31) keep the event moving efficiently through challenging logistics."

The combination of ancient Siuslaw National Forest logging roads and Yachats River vistas creates memorable suffering."

Elite rider Shawn Petersen competed in a separate category, finishing 3 minutes ahead of 5th place—\"a guy who's beat me before at the line.\" The deepest competition comes from Oregon Triple Crown Series regulars who race multiple events annually. Less competitive depth than Almanzo 100."

        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Registration runs $80-100. Coastal Waldport keeps accommodation costs reasonable compared to destination resort towns like Bend. Multiple riders mention the need for proper tire selection—Blomberg's 35mm file treads \"served me really well\" while avoiding the \"6 riders with flats in the first 5 miles.\" Elite rider Petersen noted \"Need bigger tires—descents were loose and sketchy\" after both race days. Similar expense level to Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

          "transcript": "Hey there. Welcome to another Two Wheel\nWednesdays. Yep. Event ahead. Uh today\nwe're in\nWaldport and uh Waldport, Oregon. It's\non the Oregon Central Coast about 4\nmiles up the coast from my house. And uh\nwe're here\nfor the uh\num well, let's just show you the\nsign. We're here for the Oregon Coast\nGravel Epic.\nIt's a uh the first of a\ntwo-day back-to back gravel\nevent and\nuh I'm doing the short course. We\nalready checked in last night, so we're\njust going to go see what's happening in\nregistration.\nUm here's a look at the course. The\nroute starts out in Walport and heads\nsouth. There are two large climbs on the\ncourse. The first is about 5 and a half\nmiles long with a little more than 1,200\nfeet of climbing. After dropping down to\nalmost sea level, we climb back up to\nmore than 1,400 ft in just 5 miles for\nthe second climb. From there, it's\npretty much downhill. The end of the\ntime section, the end of the race\nessentially, is at mile\n33.8. Uh, and then after that, there is\njust another five miles pretty much all\ndownhill back to Walport.\nYeah, as you can see, there's plenty of\nclimbing and uh plenty of gravel. I'm\nthinking it's going to take me probably\nabout 3 and 1/2 hours to do the 38\nmiles.\nUm, we'll see. Maybe I can beat\nthat. All\nright, check in with you\nlater. All\nright, little bit of warm up before the\nrace.\nGoing across the historic Alcia Bay\nBridge just to get the heart\nopen. Warm up a little bit cuz I think\nI'm going to freeze once I take these\nlayers off for the race.\n[Music]\nYeah. Yeah.\nAnd here we go.\nWell, eventually\nTechnically, the race is a timed event,\nnot an actual race. Your final position\nis based on your time, not what place\nyou cross the finish line. You have a\nlittle sensor on your bike that\num records your time. electronically.\nSo, I started towards the back and let\nthe guys who shaved their legs take off\nfirst. Right off the bat, there was a\nsteep quarter mile climb which set the\ntone for the day and started stringing\nout the more than 250 riders out of the\nday.\nOkay, I guess we're climbing. It's time\nto climb.\nof your life.\nYep.\nYeah. Come\non.\nOkay, about halfway through the big\nfirst\nclimb and it's a\ngrinder. I tried\nto grab a little something to eat, grab\na gel before the start of this\nclimb, and I think I got more on me than\nin\nme. I'm a sticky\nmess, but that's racing.\nOkay, here we\ngo. Okay, there's\none. Not too bad.\nAll right,\nthat was good. Back to the race. All\nright, to wash off a little\nbit, grab something to\neat, refill my bottles, and we're back\non the course.\nI'm on your left.\nThank you. Thank you.\nCourageous in the corners.\nOkay, so we're about halfway\nthrough. Uh we're on the A River\nRoad. Smooth pavement. Sure feels nice\nin my hands, my\nbutt. And\nuh I'm going pretty\ngood right now.\nEven with that\nstop, my average speed is 11 and a\nhalf, which is\ngood. I was hoping to\nfinish with a 10 and\n12 mile per hour average. So, I'm going\nfaster than\nI had hoped for, but there's still a big\nlong climb yet to go.\nSo,\nhopefully I can make up some time on\nthis flat stuff.\nOkay. See if I can get up behind this\nguy and draft a little bit.\nHe was a great little adventure dog.\nYeah, he was such a mascot. Yeah, all\nthe people love him. What can I get you?\nJust water. If you take the lid off,\nI'll fill it for you.\nAnd then you hold your bike again so it\ndoesn't fall.\nWhat do you need? Anything we can help\nyou with? Oh\nman, everything. The list is long.\nWater's over here. If you spin off your\nbottle, I'll fill it for you. Spin the\ntop. Thanks, guys. Mark, we'll see you.\nUh, yeah, maybe half and half. Okay. So,\nwhy don't you bring your bike over here\nso I can hold it for you so it doesn't\nfall and you can do whatever you would\nlike. I got it. Yep. Thanks.\nNow you can do whatever you want.\nThanks, guys. Thanks for being here.\nYou're welcome. See you.\nAnd here we\ngo. Next big climb.\nOkay, we're about miles wise. We're\nabout halfway through this second big\nclimb elevation gain.\nSo, we're about 2/3 of the of the way\ndone with\nclimbing.\nSo, I hate to say\nit cuz I know I'll jinx\nit, but it should just get easier from\nhere.\nThere's a couple guys ahead of\nme that had a nice\ncatch. One guy I'm pretty sure is in my\nage group.\nAnd we were going back and\nforth down on\nthe lower slopes of this\nclimb. But\nhe Oh way.\nAll\nright, only two and a quarter more miles\nto\ngo and then it's\na race to the finish.\nAll right, this is a good\nspot. I'm on your\nleft. Hold on. Morning. Hey.\nHi. We're almost there, I think. Yeah.\nI've been telling myself that for\nmiles. Okay, here we\ngo. So, there's the top of the big\nclimb. Second big climb.\nAnd my average is\n10.3. So I'm doing\ngood. 5 miles to the finish. Mostly\ndownhill.\nNow you roll.\nWhat a cool\nfinish. That's just cool.\nAh, sweet.\nGood stuff.\nHappy. Yeah, I finished way ahead of\nwhere I thought I was going to. Good.\nBeating your own personal best.\nAll right, made\nit. That was hard.\nWell, I beat I had I was hoping to\nfinish in three and a half hours and I\nthink I finished\nin 305 or 307 or something like that.\nSo, that's pretty good. That's pretty\ngood. I have no idea how I finished in\nmy age group.\nUm but\num I think I beat the winning time in my\na for my age group for last\nyear. So that's good.\nOkay. Uh I guess that's it for\nnow. Unless I'm going onto the podium\nand then\nwe'll have a little addendum to this.\nBut if\nnot, we'll see you tomorrow. Tomorrow is\nthe\nuh Yahhatas race. The\nuh I think it's the Oregon\ncoast gravel race or the West Coast.\nThis was the Oregon coast and tomorrow's\nthe West\nCoast. Anyway, today was Walport,\ntomorrow's\nYahhats. We'll see you tomorrow.",

          "transcript": "So, good morning. Welcome to uh day two\nof the Walport Yah weekend.\nUm so, today we're in Yahhatas. We're at\nthe\num community center, the park. This is\nLahi Dah Lane or something like that.\nAnd uh we're getting ready for the start\nof the second race.\nUm the racers meeting is in about 15\nminutes or so and then it's a slow ride\ndown the coast a little bit until the\nstart. So um it's time to get ready and\ntime to ride. I've already checked in.\nAlready got my\nnumber. Said hello to a bunch of friends\nand the girls got to run around in the\npark with some other little pups. And uh\nit's time to get ready to go. Okay,\nwe'll see you at the start.\nIt's all right, here we\ngo. This start is a little different.\nwhere we roll out to a remote start\nand we all start from there.\nDisqualified start.\nSo because of that\num I'm using the roll out to the remote\nstart as the warm up. Heat. Heat.\nThe route starts out in Yahhatz and\nheads south down Highway 101 before\nturning inland to where we all gather\nfor remote start. Right off the bat,\nyou're on to the main climb of the day,\na total of almost 1,900 ft over the\nfirst 10 miles or so. From there, it's a\nlong and mainly downhill gravel ride\ndown to Yahhatas River Road and a flat\npaved 9 miles or so to the end of the\ntime section. From there, it's another\nmile and a half back to\nYahhatz. Okay, here we go.\nSo much for a warmup, right? It was a\nwarmup cool down event\nlike the day before. Technically, it was\na timed event, not a real race. Your\nfinal position is based on your time,\nnot what place you cross the finish\nline. There's a sensor on your bike that\nstarts timing when you cross a sensor on\nthe road and stops timing when you cross\nanother one at the finish line.\nAnd here we go. Okay. Go faster. Going\nthe same speed. Now we're racing. Now\nI'm racing. Yeah.\nSuddenly going the same speed. Yeah.\n[Music]\nI rode for a little while with my friend\nStan, who is part of team K9 Crack. His\nwife Georgie makes and markets some dog\ntreats called K9 Crack. My girls love\nthem and they highly recommend them.\nI'll put a link to K9 Crack in the\ndescription\nbelow. All right, Stan, we'll see you at\nthe finish.\nWe'll see about that.\nAre you doing the long course? I am.\nYeah. A long day.\nNo, really.\nNo, it was 11.\nYeah. I use my uh my girls as an excuse.\nI don't want them to be waiting in the\ncar that long. Yeah.\nIt's a good excuse.\nThere were about 200 racers who started\nthe day and by the time we were a couple\nof miles into the first climb, we were\nall strung out across the mountain side.\nIt was a gorgeous morning and the\nscenery made the relentless climb just a\nlittle bit more pleasant.\nAfter the first climb, it was kind of up\nand down until the second aid station,\nbut primarily climbing. After the second\naid station, the course turned more\ndownhill\nand most of the climbing was behind us.\nup and down.\nAnd then it was down onto Yahhat's River\nRoad and fighting a not particularly\nnice and somewhat stiff headwind for the\nlast several miles to the finish.\nAll\nright.\nWell, made it. That was hard.\nUm, I think I beat the time I wanted to\nbeat by like seven minutes, which is\ngood. So, I came in fifth overall in my\nage group, which is still pretty good.\nIt's still not bad. I beat the uh time I\nwanted to beat.\nSo, that's it. That's it for a a\nuh two- wheeled weekend in Waldport Nah.\nIt was a gravel race weekend and it was\na lot of fun. Uh now it's time to go\ncheck out put on some clean clothes. I'm\ncovered with sweat and snot\nand\nsticky food. You can call gels and\ngummies food.\nBut it's time to uh clean up and go\ncheck out the uh the festivities and see\nwhat's going\non. Okay. Well, thanks for joining me\nfor another Two Wheel Wednesdays and I\nhope you enjoyed the ride. I sure did.\nAnd uh you know, it doesn't matter if\nyou race or not. It doesn't matter if\nyou ride a gravel bike or mountain bike\nor road bike as long as it's fresh air\nsunshine. And uh always remember, life\nis twice as good on two\nwheels. And we'll see you in the next\none.",
