Self check-in after noon Saturday and dry camping at Bohemia Park shows they've managed arrival logistics, though organizers warn riders about aid station cut-off times with \"8 am start times available for more casual riders wanting a few more minutes.\" The 400-rider cap and optional early starts prevent overwhelming their systems."

Multiple distance options let riders pick their challenge level without the all-or-nothing pressure."

The route features \"high-speed sharp turns, especially on Territorial Rd after descending Wolf Creek\" and organizers note \"Elk Road being bumpy leading to Aid 2 Medio.\" Technical challenges come from descents and road conditions rather than bike handling complexity. Less technical than The Mid South."

        "explanation": "The Gran Fondo route climbs through \"the heart of the Coast Range\" with \"high-elevation climbs, scenic descents, and sweeping views of both forest and farmland.\" One rider described tackling \"7k vert\" over the full distance. The climbing is substantial enough to create separation without requiring specialized mountain training. Similar elevation profile to Gravel Worlds."

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Mid-May in Oregon means weather gambling, as organizers acknowledge: \"During the week, it may rain because it's Oregon, so be prepared!\" Spring conditions can range from perfect to miserable, with recent Eugene area racing seeing \"overcast, and cool, sub 50 degrees.\" No reliable forecast means planning for everything. More weather exposure than Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

        "explanation": "Cottage Grove sits low enough that altitude isn't a factor for anyone living above sea level. Western Oregon's gentle elevation changes won't challenge your red blood cell count or require acclimatization strategies. The climbing comes from distance and gradient, not thin air—which is probably why they don't bother mentioning elevation anywhere in their marketing. Modest altitude compared to Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "The all-road route offers \"expansive valley views\" and passes \"by rivers and creeks\" through \"old-growth forests,\" but it's fundamentally pavement riding. Organizers promise \"some of the quietest roads that cyclists will encounter—a well kept secret, a cyclists paradise,\" delivering rural solitude rather than true wilderness adventure."

Winners get free entry for next year, showing community-level rewards."

        "explanation": "They've figured out the basics after 14 years—parade start through downtown Cottage Grove, timing stops 6 miles from finish, and optional early starts for the slower crowd. Registration caps at 400 so they're not overwhelmed by logistics nightmares. The 'quietest roads that cyclists will encounter' promise suggests they know their terrain, even if they can't be bothered to publish elevation profiles."

        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Western Oregon's 'well kept secret' roads deliver the goods if you're into rural solitude over spectacle. Starting at Bohemia Park with that downtown parade roll-out gives you some ceremonial weight before hitting those quiet backroads. Three distance options means you can pick your pain level, though they're mysteriously vague about what that pain actually looks like course-wise."
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Dry camping at Bohemia Park creates authentic community atmosphere, with fees supporting youth fundraising rather than corporate profits.

Prize structure offers free entry to overall winners and 50% off for podium finishers—community-level incentives rather than career-making opportunities. Less competitive depth than Almanzo 100. As Event philosophy [ELITE/source] puts it: \"Gran Fondo is not a race but rather a mass start event designed to draw the community together and give everyone a chance to enjoy the fun of riding a bike on the same course as the pros.\""

Packet pickup options at Coast Fork Brewing Friday evening and pre-race Saturday morning add convenience without premium pricing."

      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Registration runs $80-100. Cottage Grove keeps costs reasonable with dry camping eliminating hotel expenses and Eugene Airport access without destination markup. Organizers recommend \"28MM Slicks or 32's\" and require helmets and taillights for high-traffic zones, but equipment needs stay basic. Continental and Pactimo kit available but optional, keeping gear costs manageable. Similar expense level to Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

          "transcript": "Let's get ready to\nfondo. I'm all confused. I'm all messed\nup. I'm\nlost. I'm out here in the woods by\nmyself riding my bike, talking to\nmyself.\nWow. Wow.\nOkay, this is the race.\nDon't know the course. So, good morning.\nWelcome to another Two Wheels\nWednesdays. Today we're up in Cottage\nGrove, Oregon for the Oregon Grand\nFondo. This is my third time doing this\nevent. Just like the other two, I'm\nrunning a little bit behind.\nSo, we'll talk about a little bit more\nafter the start, but we've got about 30\nseconds before There it is.\nBefore it's time to go. So, it's time to\ngo.\n[Music]\nOfficially, the Grand Fondo isn't a\nrace. The phrase Grand Fondo roughly\ntranslates to big ride. And the original\nGrand Fondos were mass participation,\nlong distance community cycling events\nfor all levels of riders, young and old,\nslow and fast.\nBut as the saying goes, any two bicycles\nis a race.\nAnd here we go. Here at the timing\nmat and we're off.\nTechnically, it's a timed event where\nyour final place is determined by how\nlong you rode the course, not whether\nyou finished before anybody else.\nSo, I started towards the back of the\npack and moved up once I was past the\ntiming mat.\nThere was a mile or so of neutral riding\nto the edge of town and the start of the\nday's first climb. The pack of 250 or so\nriders stretched out pretty quickly once\nwe were\nunderway. Okay, Garmin says\nthere's six climbs of the day and this\nis the first\none. I'm about halfway through, so I\nhave about\nanother 6/10 of a mile to\ngo. And\nuh people are passing me, but I'm\ndetermined not to burn all my matches at\nthe start like I normally do.\nSee\nyou in a few\nhours. That was the end of the first\nclimb. And uh that's where the\ntiming the official finish is going to\nbe.\nall the way back there. Now it's time\nfor one big long\nloop and a big\ndownhill. So the entire ride today is\ngoing to be around 66\nmiles, but the time section is somewhere\n59 or 60 miles. That's the real race.\nAnd uh we ran over the mats at the start\nand that's where we finished right back\nthere. Here's a map of the\nrace. We started at Cottage Grove High\nSchool and rolled through town before\nthe first of several climbs. The course\ncould be described as a lollipop route.\nWe rode from Cottage Grove to the tiny\ntown of Lraine, Oregon, and then did a\nlarge loop before returning back to\nLraine. From Lraine, it was back the way\nwe came with one last climb, the\nbackside of our first climb of the day\nto the end of the time section. After\nthe official finish, we had a long and\nvery welcome descent back to Cottage\nGrove. All in all, it was about 66 miles\nwith a little more than 3,700 feet of\nclimbing. Yeah. So, there's some hills,\nthere's some ups and\ndowns, and uh I hope to finish the time\nsection in 4 and 1/2\nhours and\nuh you know, finish the whole day in 5\nhours.\nAll right, I'm at mile\n24 or somewhere around there. And\nuh I figure I'm going to have to average\nabout 14.\ntwo or\n14.3 miles an hour including rest\nstops to\nuh finish in 4 and 1/2\nhours. Right now I'm averaging\n16.1\nso might be able to pull it off.\nGet\naway. It's a beautiful\nride so far.\nThank you.\nFriendly\ngals. Always nice to see a smile on the\nroad.\nAll\nright. Cheering\nsection. All right. Thank\nyou. And this is the start of climb\nnumber\ntwo, which will bring us up to I\nthink the next rest\narea.\nOkay, I'm going to stop talking and\nstart climbing. It's time to climb.\nSo, I did the math wrong. I think I've\ngot to be doing math all\nday. I don't think it's 14 and a4 miles\nper hour.\nI think it's like\n136. All right. Well, here's the start\nof the next\nclimb. This one looks pretty\nsubstantial. 700 ft, 2 and 1/4 miles.\nI think the aid station is coming up\nhere\nsomewhere. I don't\nknow. I'm\nall I'm all confused. I'm all messed up.\nI'm lost.\nI'm out here in the woods by\nmyself, riding my bike, talking to\nmyself. It's all\ngood. All\nright. So when I got here,\nthanks guys. Awesome stop. Yeah. Have a\ngood one.\nDanger ahead. Woohoo. I thought I left\nhim back\nthere.\nOkay, that was like 2 minutes.\nMaybe two and a\nhalf.\nHere we\ngo. That was good. Mission accomplished.\nYeah.\nCan't do that on gravel. At least I\ncan. All right.\nWe're a little bit more than halfway\nthrough miles wise, distance-wise, and\nwe're\nabout more than a half more than halfway\nthrough elevation gain\nwise. And this is the start of what GL\nGarmin is calling climb number\nfour. It's not that long, but it looks\nkind of\nsteep. See if I weighed myself down too\nmuch at that rest stop.\nOkay, here we\nOkay, that was the top of that climb.\nthat. So, there was a ripping descent\nafter the\nuh aid\nstation which brought us to the bottom\nof that climb.\nSo, with that\ndescent and that long\nclimb, I'm still at 14.1 miles per hour.\nI think I just might make my\ngoal. But my math has\nbeen my body has\ntaken all the energy from the math part\nof my brain and put it in my lungs and\nmy\nlegs, which is\nfine. I'll get there when I get there.\nWow.\nWow. Okay, this is a race.\nH. Okay.\nSo, in preparation for this\nrace, I set up a nutrition\nplan, and I've got it printed out and\nposted right here on my top\ntube. And it was in my plan all\nalong to skip that aid station. I've got\ntwo bottles.\nI got plenty of\nfood\nand there's only like 16\nmiles left to the\nfinish. So, I didn't need to stop.\nOkay, well we're into the last\nclimb. There's like two miles left.\nAnd I think the top of the\nclimb is the end of the\ntiming. And I'm averaging right around\n14.4 miles an hour. So I think I'm going\nto beat my\ngoal. But I'm not there yet.\nWell, Garvin says that was the end of\nthe\nclimb, but we're still going\nup. And as far as I can\ntell, we're still a mile or so away from\nthe finish.\nBy the time I was finishing the medial\nroute, the fastest riders doing the full\ngrand route, 100 miles and almost 6,000\nft of climbing were coming up to their\nfinish. Those guys and gals are fast,\nman.\nYeah, I think early I was probably\npulling at my threshold and then after\nlike the first hour and a half I was\nlike I should probably knock this back\nto Right. Yeah, exactly. A little less.\nThank you. There you go. You're welcome.\nWe do have water and your soda if you\nwant it. I'm thinking about that porta\npotty myself. I've been thinking about\nit for the last few miles. I\nthought you guys had on us\n10. That's what\nAll right.\nWell, made it made it back to the start\nfinish\narea. That was\nfun. That was that was a good\nworkout. Um, I think my official time\nwas\n4 hours and 10 minutes. So, I beat my\ngoal time by 20 minutes, which is good.\nwhich is really\ngood. Um, I think I ended up sixth than\nmy age group,\nwhich I was hoping for better, but it is\nwhat it is. Those guys are just\nfaster. And\nuh, yeah, I think that puts it puts me\nout of the running. I think I'm\nmathematically eliminated from a podium\nposition for the\nuh for the\nseries. Oh\nwell, but doesn't matter. Still one more\nrace and I'm going to go for\nit. Okay, well I guess that wraps it up\nfor this week's Two Wheel Wednesdays.\nThanks for joining me. I hope you\nenjoyed the ride. I sure did.\nAnd\nuh remember, life is twice as good on\ntwo wheels. We'll see you next\ntime. And finally, a big shout out to\nMike and Andy Ripley and their crew at\nMudslinger for staging another great\nevent. See you next year.",

The course goes deep into the upper Smith River area in the western Willamette Valley and South coastal range. Riders face significant climbing with the biggest challenge being Smith River Road, climbing 1000 feet over six miles to the highest point. The terrain includes rough road sections after rest stops, with relief coming in flat prairie-like areas. The event uses electronic timing with sensors and timing mats, creating bottlenecks at the start. Rest stops are spaced every 16 miles with good food and support. The atmosphere is described as community-focused rather than ultra-competitive, drawing riders from across the state and beyond. The course features a lollipop route design with multiple substantial climbs throughout the 66-mile distance and 3700 feet of elevation gain."
