        "explanation": "Five towns, daily gear transport, and full camp setup across Central Oregon creates complexity, but Morgan Cabot notes 'the Oregon Trail Gravel Grinder entry fee included camping and meals for the entire event.' Secured parking in Bend and packet pickup the day before shows organization, though managing logistics across multiple venues still creates potential failure points."
      },
      "length": {
        "score": 5,
        "explanation": "375 miles over five days is proper stage race distance that accumulates serious fatigue. Morgan Cabot describes the strategic shift: 'After conservative and very social riding for the first 3 days, we decided to pick up the pace a little for the last two.' The multi-day format creates sustained expedition-length suffering, not just single-day endurance."
      },
      "technicality": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "The Santiam Wagon Road delivers technical challenge - Morgan Cabot describes it as 'a sandpit/rock garden hybrid through 10+km of rolling hills' with 'a fair amount of tipping over and dismounting.' Jorge Padrones notes loose descents where 'you needed to concentrate as though the road was covered in ice.' However, much of the course runs on smoother gravel roads."
      },
      "elevation": {
        "score": 5,
        "explanation": "35,000 feet over 375 miles means relentless climbing. Flo Costa set 'a 1 hour power PR' on a first climb alone, while Jorge Padrones faced a Queen Stage with 'two big climbs of more than 20 km' and '3000 elevation meters completed in the first 70 km.' The cumulative vertical is crushing across Central Oregon's high country."
      },
      "climate": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "July in Central Oregon means hot, dry conditions with intense sun and potential afternoon winds. High desert climate is generally predictable - no mud years or weather disasters mentioned. The elevation changes from Bend to the Cascades create temperature swings, but nothing that derails the event regularly."
      },
      "altitude": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Starting in Bend at 3,600 feet and climbing into the Cascades creates noticeable elevation effects over five days. The cumulative 35,000 feet includes significant time above 4,000-5,000 feet across Central Oregon's high desert. While not crushing altitude, sea-level riders feel it compounding with multi-day fatigue by the later stages."
      },
      "adventure": {
        "score": 5,
        "explanation": "Five days of stage racing through Central Oregon's backcountry, sleeping in different towns each night, with full expedition support - this is proper adventure cycling. The route connects Bend, Gilchrist, Oakridge, and McKenzie Bridge across varied high desert and Cascade terrain. You're not just riding long, you're touring Oregon's gravel network with 90 other lunatics."
      },
      "prestige": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "A 5-day stage race through Central Oregon with only 90 spots total? That's exclusive enough to matter. The race sells out and runs a waitlist, which tells you something about its reputation. Part of the Oregon Gravel Grinder Series Triple Challenge, but it's not pulling the big names or media coverage that would push it to legendary status."
      },
      "race_quality": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Five stages from Bend through Gilchrist, Oakridge, and McKenzie Bridge create proper stage race architecture with varied challenges. The course includes uphill/downhill time trials and technical wagon roads alongside high-speed gravel. Pete Stetina notes route changes 'giving more opportunities for people who are not super strong climbers for a chance of a stage win.'"
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 5,
        "explanation": "This is gravel camping done right - catered meals, nightly festivities, whiskey bar, massage add-ons, and mechanics all following you town to town. You get 'unmatched tales and friendship' because you're eating, drinking, and suffering with the same 90 people for five straight days. The VIP tent setup and daily gear transport mean you focus on riding, not logistics."
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "The intimate 90-rider field creates tight bonds through shared meals and camping, but limited size restricts broader community impact. Flo Costa appreciated 'extra time to sleep, eat, stretch' with 'great camp vibes' and 'plenty of down time to hang out with other athletes.' The multi-day format breeds connections among participants within the small field."
      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Awards go to top 3 across pro, open, junior, masters, and masters plus categories, but no mention of prize money or notable pro participation. The 90-rider cap and $1,300+ entry fee suggests serious participants, not weekend warriors. Still, without big names or competitive depth mentioned anywhere, it's more adventure-focused than race-focused."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "$1,300 minimum gets you 375 miles of racing, five days of meals, camping, support, and entertainment - that's reasonable cost-per-day for a supported stage race. The gear transport, mechanics, and daily camp setup justify the premium over single-day events. But you're still dropping serious cash for what's essentially a supported tour with timing chips."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Entry starts at $1,300 and hits $1,800 for late registration, plus you need to get to Bend and potentially add massage/VIP tent upgrades. RV camping runs $30-35/night extra, and the whiskey bar won't be free. Central Oregon in July means hotel rates are peak season if you skip the camping experience."
