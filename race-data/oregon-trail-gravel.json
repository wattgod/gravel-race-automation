Secured parking in Bend and packet pickup the day before shows organization, though managing logistics across multiple venues still creates potential failure points. As Camp Amenities puts it: \"Delicious Catered Breakfast, Lunch, & Dinner. Nightly Campsite Festivities. Post-Ride Massages (additional fee). Stocked Aid Stations. Fat Tire Celebration & Whiskey Bar.\""

Morgan Cabot describes the strategic shift: 'After conservative and very social riding for the first 3 days, we decided to pick up the pace a little for the last two.' The multi-day format creates sustained expedition-length suffering, not just single-day endurance. Among the longest in gravel, comparable to Badlands. As Stage 3 TT Format puts it: \"I love this format of racing: three timed sections on a course, 6 miles uphill, 6 miles 'rollercoaster', and 4 miles descent.\""

Jorge Padrones notes loose descents where 'you needed to concentrate as though the road was covered in ice.' However, much of the course runs on smoother gravel roads. Similar technical demands to Gravel Worlds. As Stage 2 Terrain puts it: \"Throughout the first hour of gravel roads, the size of the group stays steady, except for loosing Morgan for a brief moment due to a flat tire.\""

Flo Costa set 'a 1 hour power PR' on a first climb alone, while Jorge Padrones faced a Queen Stage with 'two big climbs of more than 20 km' and '3000 elevation meters completed in the first 70 km.' The cumulative vertical is crushing across Central Oregon's high country. Among the hilliest in gravel, comparable to Badlands.

        "explanation": "July in Central Oregon means hot, dry conditions with intense sun and potential afternoon winds. High desert climate is generally predictable - no mud years or weather disasters mentioned. The elevation changes from Bend to the Cascades create temperature swings, but nothing that derails the event regularly. Similar climate challenges to SBT GRVL."

        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Starting in Bend at 3,600 feet and climbing into the Cascades creates noticeable elevation effects over five days. The cumulative 35,000 feet includes significant time above 4,000-5,000 feet across Central Oregon's high desert. While not crushing altitude, sea-level riders feel it compounding with multi-day fatigue by the later stages. Higher altitude racing, comparable to SBT GRVL."

The route connects Bend, Gilchrist, Oakridge, and McKenzie Bridge across varied high desert and Cascade terrain. You're not just riding long, you're touring Oregon's gravel network with 90 other lunatics."

        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "A 5-day stage race through Central Oregon with only 90 spots total? That's exclusive enough to matter. The race sells out and runs a waitlist, which tells you something about its reputation. Part of the Oregon Gravel Grinder Series Triple Challenge, but it's not pulling the big names or media coverage that would push it to legendary status."

Pete Stetina notes route changes 'giving more opportunities for people who are not super strong climbers for a chance of a stage win.'

You get 'unmatched tales and friendship' because you're eating, drinking, and suffering with the same 90 people for five straight days. The VIP tent setup and daily gear transport mean you focus on riding, not logistics. As Pete Stetina puts it: \"Many of the folks in gravel want to travel for adventure, not just a race result. This is one of the best events to experience one of the USA's nicest mountain ranges.\""

Flo Costa appreciated 'extra time to sleep, eat, stretch' with 'great camp vibes' and 'plenty of down time to hang out with other athletes.' The multi-day format breeds connections among participants within the small field. As Sofia Gomez-Villafañe puts it: \"I think the vibes are so high that people forget how hard this race actually is.

The 90-rider cap and $1,300+ entry fee suggests serious participants, not weekend warriors. Still, without big names or competitive depth mentioned anywhere, it's more adventure-focused than race-focused. Similar competitive depth to Rule of Three.

The gear transport, mechanics, and daily camp setup justify the premium over single-day events. But you're still dropping serious cash for what's essentially a supported tour with timing chips."

      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Entry starts at $1,300 and hits $1,800 for late registration, plus you need to get to Bend and potentially add massage/VIP tent upgrades. RV camping runs $30-35/night extra, and the whiskey bar won't be free. Central Oregon in July means hotel rates are peak season if you skip the camping experience. Similar expense level to Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

          "transcript": "i want to tell you about our six day\ntrip on the oregon outback\nit's like 360 miles from the bottom of\noregon all the way to the top\nand bike packing is way more fun than\nbackpacking\ni'm gonna tell you how we packed for our\nself-supported six days of biking with\nfourteen thousand feet of elevation\nplus how our bodies felt during the trip\nwhat\nis going on here\nwhat are you doing and one important\nlesson from what went wrong\nwhat do you feel like you need uh i\nthink i need my sleeping pad\ncome on i dropped somewhere behind us\nthe trip was way more fun than i\nexpected and unlike backpacking where\ndownhill can be just as tough as the\nuphill we got just to\ncruise down bumpy gravel roads basically\nevery day\nsome part of every day the route itself\nis 75 unpaved\nwhich meant some jolting bumps until uh\non day two we realized it'd be way\nbetter with less air pressure\nso after i dropped my tire pressure to\n30 psi everything got way smoother\nwe passed a few very beautiful areas\nincluding fort rock which\nis a strange volcanic formation in the\nmiddle of nowhere\nthat i wouldn't recommend driving to but\nit was terrific to bike paths\nand my favorite section was on day four\nas we dropped down to the pineville\nreservoir\nand then followed the windy road next to\nthe crooked river\nwhich is very famous for anglers a lot\nof them in there searching for trout\nthe road down into primeval was mostly\npaved which makes biking way faster and\na lot smoother\nthe question i often get when i talk\nabout gravel riding is\nwhy bike on gravel or specifically why\nwould you pick\na 75 unpaved route well to be honest the\nrough texture is not the highlight of\nthe experience\nbut desolate roads with no cars is\namazing\nwe got some fun opportunities for\nadversity like four creek crossings on\nday five the last of which required us\nto take our shoes off and wade through\nthe water but we fared all right all of\nour stuff stayed dry\nand we actually had a really nice lunch\nbreak next to the creek\nthis is the food that we brought which\nwas a lot of dehydrated meals\nalso some tasty bites i had a lot of fig\nbars\npeanut butter and jelly was a big staple\nand the peanut butter filled pretzels\nwere delicious\ntwo chips\n[Music]\nwe're at the restaurant which is\nwherever we want to eat at six o'clock\nend of day three how do you feel i feel\nworked\ngot uh two gears on this puppy uh\nsome tired legs they're not very easy\nthey got me here but with a little bit\nof effort\ni broke my right shifter on day three\nwhich meant i couldn't shift\nmy rear derailleur that means i was\nstuck in one gear\nand uh luckily the cable held tension so\nwe could manually adjust which one gear\ni was in\nbut it's not very convenient but the\nguys at the good bike co in primeval\nthey tried to help me but they couldn't\nfix the problem\nbut you know we biked three more days\nwith me\nbiking in one gear at a time and yeah i\nstopped to manually downshift before the\nbig hills but in the scheme of a nine\nhour bike day\nit doesn't matter much to stop for a\nminute or two to tweak things and\nwhat mattered the most was pedaling and\nmoving because what eventually gets us\nthrough the trip\nis moving you got to keep your bike\nmoving so i don't know if you can see\nthat but i'm in the second to lowest\ngear\njohn was a total genius because he asked\nme if we were bringing chairs\nand i said why would you ever do that\nand i'm never going on another bike trip\nwithout a chair\nso i know you're busy but could you give\nus a rundown\nof your misfortune so far as of day\nthree\num well earlier in the trip when my\nsleeping pad fell off my\nbike and i probably could have gotten it\npretty quickly except some guy going the\nother way picked it up\nand so i had to chase him down to get my\nsleeping pad back\nadding six miles to our ride i broke my\nshifter so i can't\ni've only got two gears and i got a flat\ntire today\num i think that sums it up what i'm\ndoing here is collecting\npine needles uh so that i can sleep on\nthem because my sleeping pad\nis deflating six days basically anything\nthat goes wrong\nwe can handle basically anything\nanything that goes wrong for jono i'm\ngonna be just fine\nall right cut we're done we're done here\nall right\noh what's this is it time for a\nrefreshment\noh boy oh yeah",

They used the Swiss Army Knife of bikes, the Specialized Diverge.   If you love gravel bikes, adventure bikes, and epic adventures, you'll love this video.

The  we're just in this desert again and you get from the road you turn off on the\ndry lake bed where there's not really a road it's just this big giant dried-up lake that you're riding across\nwe're making really good time like we're moving across this dry lake bed and then all of a sudden just you know we just we hit this mud. We were  riding mostly along the same course  that the San Felipe  250 was on and it was just a few weeks before so what happens is these guys go through this and they just tear it up and there's loose  sand everywhere\nJames:\n I've got 30 pounds of bike i have a hundred and fifty pounds of me and it'sand it's and it's keeping my tire is that wide so it's just like riding through treacle  a or something.  So I said to Seans What about that desert over there, you know just to our right\nwhy are we riding in that and  he said I don’t know and suddenly  apart from all the plants wanted to kill us something while making way faster progress\nSean:  You know we're riding along and James is following me that you can't see those rocks and bam James hit a big rock 40 minutes from the finish and  he  gets a flat",

around the world\nthese routes are mapped and chronicled\nby a core group of experienced root\ndesigners and of course a thriving group\nof contributors so in this video i'm\ngoing to share our top 12 routes on\nbikepacking.com that have been searched\nin 2021 some of these routes are a part\nof the bike packing collective route\nnetwork which are original to us or\nsupported by the collective\nlet's do it\n[Music]\nso real quick if you do head to our\nwebsite you will find that full network\nof routes including race routes\ncontributed routes and of course our\nroutes you'll also see our overnight\nroute section in which we highlight user\nsubmitted overnight bike packing trips\nbut in this case i will be sharing all\nof the routes i talk about in the\ndescription below developed by logan\nwatts ultrabase here is a\n1336 kilometer route that traverses\nsouthern spain with its epic gr7\nfootpath as its backbone ultravasir\ncrosses southern spain from cadiz in the\nwest to valencia on the mediterranean\ncoast this challenging bike packing\nroute flows through countless mountain\nranges and parks incorporating many foot\nand bike trails this 85 off-road route\nhas a difficult rating of 7 out of 10\nwhich means it's rather tough some of\nthe tracks are steep and crumbly and\nhike bikes aren't too infrequent meaning\nlogan recommends rolling nothing smaller\nthan a two-inch tire southern spain is\nfull of magnificent views and rustic\ncharm the camping is relatively easy and\nthe food is rather cheap this route\nlooks fantastic and if you're looking\nfor a route for you know those shoulder\nseasons fall and spring\nsouthern spain is the place for you the\nasiago loop was created by andrea securo\nwho also developed the vanetto trill a\npopular 450 kilometer event through the\ndolomites the asiago loop is a 200\nkilometer weekend bike packing route\nthat takes in the incredible scenery of\nthe asiago plateau via a mix of gravel\nroads single track trails and remote\ntwo-track that traverses the area's\nlimestone cliffs alpine pastures and of\ncourse rich history the route begins and\nends in the town of asiago which is the\nmain town of this area and happens to be\nin the middle of the plateau it travels\non 75 dirt with a small portion of\nriding on single track some highlights\nare passing by loads of world war one\nhistorical sites the city of rock\nformations and of course\ngetting some asiago cheese while the\nroute isn't terribly challenging and it\nhas been done on a drop bar mountain\nbike or a gravel bike the recommended\nbike is a hardtail or full suspension\nbike and finally the asiago loop is a\ngreat spring or fall loop but it can be\ndone in the summer although it is much\nbusier launch just a few weeks ago the\ntree to sea loop was developed by our\nvery own miles arbor the tree to sea\nloop is an incredible 1000 kilometer\ngravel loop around the lesser known\nparts of the northern part of vancouver\nisland in british columbia the route\nlinks massive valleys oceanside villages\ntowering coastal mountains and deep\nfjords via an impressive patchwork of\nforest service roads aside from some of\nthe best gravel riding on the coast\nthere are opportunities for spelunking\nwhale watching waterside camping and\nmuch more the route is 90 off-road with\na little sliver of single track for good\nmeasure you can expect riding on gravel\nroads in double track the majority of\nwhich is graded and maintained however\ngolf ball-sized gravel is not uncommon\nbut the route is 100 rideable miles\nsuggests a gravel bike with at least 45\nmillimeter tires but a hardtail with\nboth a rigid or suspension fork is not\noverkill anywhere from spring to fall is\na great time to ride this route and it\ncan get warm in the summer but\ndefinitely anticipate quickly changing\nweather the trans cambrian way was\ndeveloped by chris goodman a seriously\ntalented writer and photographer the\ntrans cambrian way snakes its way across\nthe heart of wales covering around 100\nmiles from nightin on the english border\nto dovey junction on the irish sea the\nunpaved trail takes you across the\ncambrian mountains the oldest mountain\nrange in europe climbing around 12 000\nfeet over hills and moorland through one\nof the most sparsely populated parts of\nwales grassy hills rocky single track\nancient ridge roads forest track and\nnumerous rivers to ford this ride has it\nall and yes it passes plenty of small\ntowns and villages and if you time it\nright you can get a pub meal and a beer\nevery day vt xl was developed by the one\nand only joe cruz vermont resident\ncollege professor long time bike packer\ndangle hater joe is a wonderful human\nand makes fantastic roots the vt xl is\none virtually continuous path from\ncanada across vermont all the way down\nto the massachusetts border linking the\nstate's northeast and southwest corner\nand capturing its geography landscape\nand town life experiencing that new\nengland charm and the distinct affection\nthat locals have for this place outside\nof the fact that you get to say you rode\nthe whole state of vermont the 300 mile\nroute is 90\nunpaved and the majority of the vt xl is\non smooth well-maintained dirt roads and\nit often passes close to resupply towns\nso provisioning is not that challenging\nthere are however perhaps a dozen rugged\nand rocky sections that being said the\nvt xl was designed for a gravel bike in\na gravel bike trip however having a tire\nunder 35 millimeters is going to make it\nless fun originally conceived by alan\ngoldsmith a legend in the ultra\nendurance cycling world and some of you\nmay know him as brad pitt this route was\ncontributed to bikepacking.com by\noutdoor enthusiast lars henning the\nhighland trail explores 550 miles of\nsome of the most remote and rugged\nstretches of the scottish highlands the\nroute features world-class single track\nand dirt roads with stunning views\nthroughout but you must put in some\nserious effort to reap the rewards in\none of the most picturesque settings of\nthis route which is actually at the\nnorthernmost part of the route requires\nquite a bit of hike a bike even for the\nmost proficient cyclists the 75 unpaved\nroute consists of three smaller loops\nstarting and finishing in tinder\nhalf of this route travels on single\ntrack making it a good candidate for a\nhardtail mountain bike but i pedaled it\non a full suspension bike and was very\nhappy i did so outside of the rugged\nnature of this trail mother nature is\nanother element that has been known for\ndemonstrating all four seasons in one\nday plus you have those midges to deal\nwith making may and june the most\nrealistic time to tour this route\ndespite those challenges this route for\nme was one of the most rewarding bike\npacking experiences i've ever endured\nand if you really like single track this\nroute is definitely

top\ncraft beer destinations via iconic\ngravel roads through north carolina's\nappalachian mountains though challenging\nthe route is designed specifically for\ndrop bar gravel riding and is\napproachable on nearly any bike the 60\nunpaved route travels along several\nbucket list gravel roads and several\nbits of lesser-known forest service\nroads and single track no matter the\npath it brings you an opportunity to\ntaste some of the best beers on the\nplanet from fonta floral in morgantown\nto oscar blues in brevard and nearly a\ndozen or so in between the bc trail is a\n200 kilometer route that spans the\nsouthernmost portion of british columbia\nstarting in the fraser valley and ending\nin ferny on the alberta border this is\nanother route contributed by miles arbor\nthe route follows decommissioned rail\ntrails gravel side roads forest service\nroads and single track the bc trail\nboasts some of the most spectacular\nviews the province has to offer the 90\noff-road route is arguably the best way\nto explore and visit many breathtaking\nregions of british columbia the route\nmixes a healthy dose of front country\namenities with remote sections that\nrequire a bit more skill and planning\nthe majority of the route is rough\nchunky and often very sandy so plus size\ntires or a suspension fork is not a bad\nidea and miles mentions that he probably\nwouldn't go under a two-inch tire the\ncolorado trail\nis a reality in large part due to a\nvariety of individuals including goody\ngaskill the colorado trail was finally\ncompleted in 1987. after many years of\nslow progress and lack of funding one of\nthe longest single track heavy bike\npacking trails in the united states the\n540-mile\ncolorado trail offers a high altitude\nexperience unlike any other from buffed\nsingle track to head scratching hika\nbike sections from 13 000 feet all the\nway down to river basins the colorado\ntrail is a must do if you love single\ntrack because of the remote nature high\naltitude and difficult trail this is\nlikely one of the hardest routes on\nbikepacking.com the route has 85 percent\ndirt and 55 single track and often very\nslow and rough single track at that so\nwe suggest a full suspension mountain\nbike or at least a hardtail this is\ndefinitely not a drop bar friendly trail\nthe point-to-point trail travels well in\nboth directions it's equally as\ndifficult but it's also extremely\nrewarding just to do a weekend trip on\nportions of the trail the window to ride\nthe colorado trail is all dependent on\nthe previous winter if it's a big snow\nyear you're probably not going to get on\nthe trail until july if it's a light\nslow year you probably can get on the\ntrail in june typically the end of the\nseason for the colorado trail starts\nsometime in september but it is not\nuncommon to see snow year-round at\nhigher elevations the colorado trail is\nhands down my favorite bike packing trip\nand as i mentioned if you like single\ntrack you need to put this on your list\ndeveloped by the belgian-born oregon\nraised lover of outdoors explorer of\ncultures kevin not to links the ardennes\narbola is a\n365 kilometer route in belgium and it\nhas something for everyone fast forest\ngravel beat up single track cruiser bike\npath through castle dotted valleys\nquaint encounters with cherry locals\nhumbling reminders of the area's\npoignant history including the battle of\nthe bulge and the promise of fantastic\nbeer around every corner the root riding\nsurfaces run the gamut from paved\nbicycle paths of city centers to swampy\nsingle track to flowy riverside dirt\nroads a rigid gravel bike with 42\nmillimeter tires with some bite should\nbe sufficient if conditions are dry\notherwise a two inch tire would be ideal\nfor those unpredictable and varying\ntrail conditions history buffs will love\nriding in this region i actually myself\ngot in a rabbit hole of world war ii\nhistory and well we can leave that for\nanother day but this route truly has a\nton of history and if you're looking to\nride it it can be written from spring to\nfall however it can be deceptively hot\nand humid in the middle part of the\nsummer another route developed by joe\ncruz and logan watts both who happen to\nbe beer aficionados paired with the fact\nthat vermont has the second most\nbreweries per capita this route only\nmakes sense the 255 mile green mountain\ngravel growler is an extraordinary loop\nthat weaves a selection of storybook\nfarm dirt roads flowy new england\nsingletrack and rugged historic woodland\npaths to create a circuit of some of the\nworld's best and most coveted craft\nbeers a lot of vermont's breweries are\nin the middle of nowhere or at least in\nthe middle of quaint towns scattered\namongst the rolling countryside that's\nanother aspect that inspired this route\nvermont boasts the highest percentage of\nunpaved roads in the country the 66\noff-road route was designed for a gravel\nbike in mind with 40 millimeter tires i\ndon't know about you but this particular\nroute has a certain draw for me\nespecially amongst the fall colors with\nbeer relatively simple riding sign me up\nlast and certainly not least\nthe number one most searched and viewed\nroute on bikepacking.com this year\nis the european divide trail from the\nshores of the arctic ocean in norway to\nthe wild coastline of southwestern\nportugal the european divide trail is a\nkilometer bike packing route that's\nincredibly diverse and always full of\nsurprises it's an epic off-road crossing\nof the european continent from the north\neast to the southwest traversing nine\ncountries in countless dirt roads single\ntracks quiet lanes and traffic free\nbyways the route came from andy cox's\npersonal desire looking to create an\noff-road touring route across europe in\nthe similar vein to the great divide\nmountain bike route in the united states\nhe says i wanted to make a mostly\nrideable relatively easy route where the\ndifficulty comes from its length the\nvarious climates it crosses and the\namount of time it takes to complete it\nthe entire solo project took him three\nyears to complete that's impressive and\nandy we thank you for your time and\ndedication to this incredible route the\nroute is comprised of three sections the\nnorth which travels endless forests\nlakes and rivers from the arctic ocean\ncoast of norway into sweden the central\ntravels a patchwork of fields forests\ntowns and cities packed with history\nculture and a huge variety of regional\ndifferences through denmark germany\nfrance and switzerland and finally the\nsouthern section where the soil turns\ninto rock dust sand and gravel most\nplants have spines in the mediterranean\nsea is the biggest climactic influence\ntraveling through south central france\nspain and finally portugal as far as a\nbike is concerned andy mentions that\nmost off-road bikes will get you by but\nandy suggests a minimum of 40 millimeter\ntires with something in the range of 50\nmillimeter tires to be on the safe side\nand to be a bit more comfortable so\nthose are the top 12 most popular routes\non bikepacking.com today so now it's\ntime to hear from you all if you've\nridden one of those roots let us know\nwhy and how you liked it and if you\nhaven't written any of them if you were\nto pick one which one would it be\nas always thank you all so much for\nwatching and until next time\npedal further\nyou",

The H-Bar is much more than a different-looking handlebar: it's the result of years of prototyping and riding, and the result is a handlebar that gives a very wide range of useful and distinct positions, allows you to use standard mountain bike controls, and has the ability to transform almost any bike into a more versatile and more comfortable machine.\n\nOlder H-Bar videos: https://youtu.be/SUxIflfeqLc?list=PL9VmikAjJZcJWBF8m39Xp5Nsh9ie-GZJH\n\nH-Bar manual: http://www.jonesbikes.com/content/Jones_H-Bar_GUIDE_web_v2.pdf\n\nH-Bar web page: http://www.jonesbikes.com/h-bar/\n\nH-Bar store: http://www.jonesbikes.com/handlebars/\n\nCheck out our website: http://www.jonesbikes.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/jonesbikes\n\nFollow us on Instagram: https://instagram.com/jonesbikes/\n\nSubscribe to our YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/user/Veloperator",

          "transcript": "so this handlebar what I was looking for\nwas something that brought my hands into\na more natural position and I was just\nholding two pieces of tubing in my shop\nat night and just kind of moving them\naround and I kind of settled on\n45° uh for many reasons after\nexperimenting with some other angles a\nnormal bar you're holding into one\nposition you can't lean back any further\nyou can't lean forward any further but\nwith this bar you have different\npositions to hold on to the first fast\nmountain bike cross country Racers were\na bunch of Road Racers who came in and\nbrought their bicycle fit into Mountain\nbiking and when I was at GT we were\nactually building their mountain bikes\nto fit them like their road bikes and\nthat is how a lot of bikes still are\ntoday a lot of bikes are built kind of\nwith Road fit formulas when I broke away\nfrom that while I was building my bikes\nI realized if I could just stand on my\nfeet more and hold on to the handlebars\nas if I'm standing on my feet and\nholding on to just something right in\nfront of me and I'm not leaning on I'm\njust holding on to it and I can steer\nwith this like somebody on a motorcycle\nsomebody on a jet ski somebody on a\nsnowmobile or even\nuh uh pushing my wheelbarrow I'm just\nholding on this wheelbarrow and I'm\nwalking and I'm using a lot of uh Power\nto move a large load and I'm trying to\nbe efficient while doing it and I can do\nall this without hurting my back or\nwithout being bent over um and generate\na lot of force The\nHandlebar allows you to slide further to\nthe back so if I'm going down a steep\nhill I can shift my weight way to the\nback and put the front wheel out in\nfront and get behind it and make it down\nthe Steep Hill without endo and if I'm\ngoing up a steep hill I can slide my\nhands into this forward position stand\nup and climb in a very forward position\nthis is one of the original or older\nstyle H bars 45° sweep same position\nright here right at the wide part of the\nbar one finger breaking on on this\noriginal handlebar the brake lever went\nin the front you can see there's the\nclamp clamping right in front so you'd\nslide your brake lever over the front\nand break from here and there really\nwasn't room to add shifters because the\nshifters wanted to be right where the\ncrossbar is so now on the on the newer\nversion of the of the loop H bar this\nbends forward and now allows you to put\nthe shifter and break on from the from\nthe rear and now you have access to\neverything and you can reach the shifter\nyou can see how it evolved three\nstraight pieces of tubing eventually\nended up with a curve so you could hold\ninto this a little better and then the\nfull connection came in the front once\nthe brake levers and shifters went to\nthe rear so I've been evolving this bar\nfor for a long time and um it's a great\nbar this bar has many hand positions\nuh this is my main position for control\none finger on the brake great control\nyou're you're kind of riding in a short\nstem position not too much weight on\nyour hands if I'm if I'm riding along I\nwant to go a little faster and I'm kind\nof chasing somebody down or just want to\nhunch over a little more I'll ride out\ninto this position and kind of lean down\nsometimes spread out into this position\nthis is great if your hands are you know\nfeeling uncomfortable at all because it\nreally opens the blood back up into your\nfingers so I'll ride this a lot on a\nlong ride and then if I want to rest and\nget down a little more into a headwind\nhook down into here so we have all these\npositions um reaching the brakes of\ncourse you can still reach the brakes\nfrom different positions reach your\ngears this is the 710\nbar uh the 710 MIM from Center to Center\non the width here we also have a 660 mm\nbar that comes to right about here it's\nthe original width of the bar and with\nthe 660 you're right at the back of the\nbar when you're uh at the at the rear\ncontrol position but with the 710 you\ncan slide all the way up to here sit\nupright and just kind of enjoy the ride\nand sit up a little more further back\nbut if you're riding in narrower Trails\nthis could be a little too wide hitting\nthe trees so for out open road touring\nand longdistance riding we're seeing\nmore people going with the loop 710\nbecause you can sit back here and get\nmore comfortable uh and you have just\nmore hand positions here's the same\nhandlebar here it is on on a Jones 29\nset up for the road and it has the\nnarale uh Arrow bar\nI already showed you we have these\npositions riding up into here you have\nthe semi Arrow position but if you\nreally want to lean down you can hook\ninto here good steering uh good\naerodynamics put a little extra padding\non the crossbar right here for my\nforearms actually my forearms are\nactually resting here and here I don't\nreally need cups or anything like that\nto rest my arms a lot of people are\nreally into this bar and I'm happy\nbecause the the main reason I do this is\nso that I can have I mean it's really so\nI can have the bike I want to ride so I\ncan ride the best I can possibly ride\nbecause the bikes that I rode in the\npast held me back and would cause me to\ncrash cause me to slide out make my\nhands going um uh just wear me out and\nmake me quit riding sometimes or not\neven start riding because it was so\nuncomfortable or or so dangerous in a\nway and by\nchanging what I believed in\nbikes and realizing that a lot of the\nthings that I had believed in bikes and\nhad been taught in bikes it's it it's\nnot correct information I realized uh\nthat I could really improve things and\nmake it a lot better",

Northern Vancouver Island features predominantly graded forest service roads with golf ball-sized gravel sections that remain fully rideable. Southern Spain presents more challenging conditions with steep, crumbly tracks requiring frequent hike-a-bike sections. Riders recommend minimum 2-inch tires for Spain's difficult terrain and 45mm tires for Vancouver Island routes, though hardtails aren't overkill. Weather changes rapidly on coastal routes, requiring preparation for varying conditions. The Jones H-bar system offers multiple hand positions for different terrain, allowing riders to shift weight back on steep descents and forward on climbs. Camping is relatively easy in southern Spain with cheap food options, while Vancouver Island offers oceanside camping opportunities near towering coastal mountains and deep fjords."
