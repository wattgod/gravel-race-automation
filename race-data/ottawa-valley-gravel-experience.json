Three options (34km/55km/97km) provide choice, but none push into truly demanding territory. Sean Reilly's 1:53:57 winning time on the Medio suggests steady but not punishing effort. More compact than Grinduro."

Less technical than The Mid South."
      },
      "elevation": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Gorra Hill stands out as a named climb, but the \"rolling country roads of West Carleton\" suggests accumulated elevation rather than true mountain suffering. The 6.7% DNF rate on Epic course indicates manageable climbing that doesn't break riders. Less climbing than The Mid South."
      },
      "climate": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Mid-April in Ontario creates weather uncertainty, evidenced by varying DNF rates across distances. The Medio course achieved perfect completion (0 DNFs from 40 starters) while Petit had 9.1% DNF rate, suggesting conditions can affect shorter efforts unexpectedly. More weather exposure than Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

      "altitude": {
        "score": 1,

      "adventure": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Routes explore \"spectacular network\" of logging roads through \"rural and bucolic area\" alongside farms. The famous K&P Rail Trail provides historical interest, but this remains countryside touring rather than wilderness exploration."

      "prestige": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Shane Hotchkiss organizes a regional Ontario event with 94 total participants in 2025. No pro field or notable racing pedigree, though tight Epic finish (top 3 within 1 second) suggests some competitive depth at the front."
      },
      "race_quality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Chip timing, ATV support, aid stations, and route markers provide solid infrastructure. Post-race meal and awards ceremony for all distances shows attention to participant experience, though the small-town scale limits overall production value."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Event delivers \"TONS of laughs, beautiful trails, and all around good vibes\" according to rider reports. Awards ceremony and post-ride meal with free beer create community atmosphere, though the 9:00-3:00 window suggests casual rather than intense racing culture."
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Race director Shane Hotchkiss participates as a rider himself, fostering grassroots connection. The post-race meal and awards ceremony build local camaraderie, but with under 100 participants, the community impact remains regionally contained."
      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Josh Tyers won Epic in 3:01:37 with tight competition at front, but 94 total participants across three distances indicates small regional field. No documented pro riders or competitive racing history beyond local Ontario gravel series participation. Thinner field than Ouray Gravel Grinder."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "High value score makes sense when entry fees are apparently so low they're not worth advertising. Three distance options, chip timing, support, and GPX files available suggests decent bang for your buck. For a regional gravel ride with actual organization, the cost-benefit ratio probably works in your favor."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Registration runs $50-75 CAD. Calabogie location keeps travel costs reasonable for Ontario riders as a drive-to day event. No lodging required, though April weather may demand gear investment. Route files available in GPX and Strava formats for pre-race reconnaissance. Similar expense level to Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."
