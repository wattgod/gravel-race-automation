        "explanation": "Late March in Arkansas means temperatures 'can vary widely from the mild in the 70's to very cold below freezing and weather can change abruptly.' Race directors plan for course reroutes and weather delays, which tells you everything about Arkansas spring reliability. When organizers specifically warn about lightning stops, you know the weather gamble is real."

        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Ouachita Mountains near Mount Ida barely register elevation impact, with riders camping at the school and experiencing zero physiological effects from altitude. The climbing challenge comes from grade steepness, not thin air at these Arkansas hill country elevations."

        "explanation": "Ouachita National Forest singletrack and technical creek crossings deliver real backcountry experience beyond typical gravel fare.

But Arkansas isn't exotic destination adventure—this is regional technical riding, not expedition-level discovery."

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Twenty-three years of operation since 2001 doesn't automatically create prestige when nobody outside Arkansas knows about it. No pro field, no notable winners mentioned in any coverage, and zero YouTube presence means this stays firmly regional. The Ouachita Trail and Womble Trail are legit IMBA Epic terrain, but that doesn't translate to gravel racing clout."

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Well-marked courses and solid volunteers keep things functional, but the organization shows cracks. Multiple conflicting start times listed in their own documentation (10 AM vs 8 AM sharp) suggests sloppy communication. The school cafeteria hub works for logistics, but 'ample aid stations' without specifics means they're winging the details."

      "experience": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Camping on school grounds, cafeteria breakfast, and gym floor sleeping creates an authentic small-town race vibe that either charms you or doesn't. One rider's highlight was seeing 'a bull with balls as big as my head' on a ranch during the ride, which perfectly captures the Arkansas backwoods character. The Ouachita River views and National Forest setting deliver scenery, not manufactured adventure."

        "explanation": "Jess Nankman highlighted \"Good old Arkansas hospitality\" with locals offering water bottles along the course and volunteers \"moping the showers and refilling toilet paper.\" The school cafeteria serves hot meals family-style, while the event functions as a fundraiser for the local community and school needs."

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Cash podium awards suggest someone cares about competition, but zero mention of notable riders or competitive depth tells the real story. A 60+ mile Arkansas race in late March isn't pulling serious talent from established gravel circuits. The technical singletrack might attract local mountain bikers, but that doesn't create gravel racing depth."

        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Camping on school grounds, cafeteria meals, and gym sleeping keep costs reasonable for a weekend adventure. Two days of racing (gravel Saturday, mountain bike Sunday) plus food and lodging at the venue delivers solid bang for buck. Entry fees aren't disclosed, but the grassroots operation suggests they're not gouging participants for Arkansas trail access."

        "explanation": "Gym sleeping options and on-site camping eliminate lodging costs, while Jess Nankman noted carrying \"all our Honey Stinger nutrition in our back pockets\" for 3-6 hour race duration. Rural Arkansas location means driving rather than flights, keeping travel costs reasonable for regional participants."
