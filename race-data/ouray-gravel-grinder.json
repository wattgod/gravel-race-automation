      "race_quality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "As there is no organized 'Ouray Gravel Grinder' event, there's no race organization to evaluate. Self-supported riding means no aid stations, no course marking, no official support. Riders are on their own."

      "experience": {
        "score": 5,
        "explanation": "Despite lack of organization, the experience itself is unforgettable - for better or worse. The scenery is 10/10, the challenge is severe, and completing routes like the Alpine Loop or Imogene Pass creates lasting memories. You'll remember this forever."

      "community": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Small, dedicated bikepacking community rather than organized race culture. The Rodeo Labs expeditions and nearby events create some community, but there's no race-day vibe or legendary culture specific to this event."

      "expenses": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Moderate total cost with lodging at $200-300/night, reasonable airport access, and no entry fee for self-supported riding. A week trip can be done for under $500 excluding flights - reasonable for such exceptional terrain."

        "score": 5,
        "explanation": "Extreme technical terrain with jeep roads, bare rock sections, 10%+ grades, and mandatory hike-a-bike on passes above 12,000 ft. Imogene is 'barely a road, a trail' - this is as technical as gravel gets."

        "explanation": "Starting at 7,792 ft and topping out at 12,800+ ft on Engineer Pass (13,114 ft on Imogene). This is among the highest gravel riding in the Lower 48 with severe physiological impact - expect 20-30% power loss."

      "logistics": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Remote but accessible. Montrose airport is 35 miles, Durango 70 miles. Small-town services with limited hours. Requires 5+ days for altitude acclimation. Not extreme remoteness but significant planning required."

      "adventure": {
        "score": 5,
        "explanation": "Absolute bucket-list territory. The 'Switzerland of America' with 13,000+ ft peaks, historic mining towns, alpine meadows, and routes that push riders to their absolute limits. Life-changing scenery matched by life-changing difficulty."
