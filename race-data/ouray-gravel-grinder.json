Longer than Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

Among the most technical in gravel, on par with Badlands."

        "explanation": "The San Juan Range experiences 72-81 thunderstorm days annually - Colorado's highest.

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Without an organized event, there's no race infrastructure to evaluate. Self-supported riding means no aid stations, course marking, or official support. Riders navigate independently through terrain that demands complete self-sufficiency in extreme conditions."

        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "No organized competition means no competitive field to assess.

Thinner field than Back Forty Highlander."
