Longer than Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

Among the most technical in gravel, on par with Badlands."

        "score": 5,
        "explanation": "The San Juan Range experiences 72-81 thunderstorm days annually - Colorado's highest.

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Without an organized event, there's no race infrastructure to evaluate. Self-supported riding means no aid stations, course marking, or official support. Riders navigate independently through terrain that demands complete self-sufficiency in extreme conditions."

        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "No organized competition means no competitive field to assess.

Thinner field than Back Forty Highlander."

          "transcript": "modern gravel bikes are getting out of\nhand which is why I wanted to build this\nbike because I thought you would find it\njust as fascinating as I\ndid while the frame sets the standard\nit's the parts that set the tone for\nthis whole build all the way down to the\nwheels which are Chris King grd 23s\nwhich have several things that I think\nyou'll find fascinating the rims are\nFusion fiber which is different than\ncarbon because it's made in the USA it's\nmore compliant and it's recyclable I\nknow I talk about it a lot I love this\nstuff interesting side note Chris King\nis actually where I found out about\nFusion fiber forgein bond for the first\ntime yeah and I haven't looked\nback King also suggested groundkeeper\nfor some custom decals on the rims it's\nvery straightforward you could use any\ndesign and the template is already\nfigured out but take note we have to put\nthese on ourselves so mark your spots\ntake your time read the instructions\nyou'll be\nfine I\nhope and these rings of comfort are\nlaced up to Chris King's two-tone hubs I\nlike these because they're also made in\nthe USA come with a lifetime warranty\nand are almost as fun to look at as they\nare to ride look at that adorable little\nthrough axle it looks like a Chris King\nheadset cap beautiful and these wheels\nare set up with schabbi G1 Ultra bytes\nthey're 700x 45 but I got room for\nplenty more so for all the reasons I\njust explained is why I went with this\nwheel set but also because this bike is\nkind of a wild child and it's going to\nwant to go into some weird situations\nand I know that these wheels are going\nto be capable and comfortable for long\nsessions over some rough stuff and\nbecause the bike was built at King we\nwere able to add a lot of these fun pops\nof color from the C collar to the\nheadset and it just gives the bike a\nlittle bit more of a playful Vibe which\none I love and two I don't know if I can\nhelp myself but honestly one of the\nhardest parts of the whole build was\npicking the colors for the pops are\nthere different colors can we pick\ncolors we are going to holy it was\nman\n[Music]\nthat Greg what's the biggest\nmisconception of Chris King we don't\nexpect our bearings to wear out and we\nare still very much a small company\neverything from Chris King made in the\nUSA lifetime warranty and color options\nI mean to me it just but real talk what\ncolor would you have gone with\nall right what's the deal with this\nFrame this is a to from parley who has\nover 25 years experience making some of\nthe highest quality carbon fiber frames\non the market and this one's\nparticularly interesting because this is\nnot a frame I would expect to see from a\nhigh-end frame manufacturer which is why\nI thought you would find this so\ninteresting I would have expected some\nfast uncomfortable race oriented gravel\nbike like a road bike with clearance for\nbig tires but the TA is much more of an\nadventure Seeker sure you could race on\nit but its heart is more in the\nmountains opposed to trying to be the\nfastest person through the\nmountains that's so sick I love it and\nthis is in part due to the monoco design\nwhich means the frame is one piece and\nthey can design in compliance and\nstiffness at different parts which means\nthis thing excels in the descents it's\nvery comfortable and it is very light\nall right bottle cages pedals this thing\nweighs in at 20.3 lb or 9 and 1/4\nkg plus it's got one of these cool trunk\nthings so you just you know and then all\nyour tools and things are in here\nthere's actually a pump in\nhere and I'm personally kind of a fan of\nthe raw carbon look what do you think it\nis cool looking and for a little context\ncompared to the Stigmata which I really\nenjoyed this bike is just a little more\nslacked out in all the areas only by a\nlittle bit but it adds up to a more\ncompliant more comfortable stable ride\nwhich is\njust I just appreciate it honestly I'm\njust so impressed that they didn't make\nan aggressive uncomfortable race\nmachine respect and don't get me wrong\nthis thing is not slow by any means it's\njust got its priorities figured\nout you guys are\nready all right let's talk about this\ngroup set on this bike I decided to do\nsomething I don't normally do and went\nwith Shimano grx\ndi2 because I know and love sham which\nis why I thought it made sense to see\nhow the other side lives and go with\nShimano on this build because ultimately\nI want to be able to give you an\ninformed perspective of what both brands\nhave to offer because without you I I\nwouldn't even be here and it is\ndifferent this is an electronic 2x2\nsetup with a 31 to 48 in the front and\nan 11 to 36 in the back and for someone\nthat's really used to one by it's almost\ncomical watching me shift gears for the\nfirst 20 minutes on this bike how does\nit oh there's another ring a couple\nquick notable differences between this\nand Sham is the battery lives in the\nseat post you charge it from the\nderailer the shifter ergonomics are\nphenomenal and the blips that samam just\ncame out with shimano's done that for\nyears you switch your garment screen\nwith this it's awesome and the shifting\nexperience is incredibly smooth as long\nas you can get used to shifting two\nthings that's a one bite problem yeah if\nyou like a samam versus Shimano video\nDrop N9 in the chat what else what else\noh this is interesting this ergon\nAllroad saddle appears to have boost in\nit for anyone that's ever had a pair of\nAid dos with Boost in it the experience\nis very unique so the prospect of having\nthat in a saddle is color me intrigued\nof course it's integrated handlebars and\nstem from FSA that always looks amazing\nand every mechanic always hates setting\nit up but look at that color combo I'm\njust oh my God does even got a little\nbump down there come on\n[Applause]\nnow before we do a proper mission on\nthis rig I'd like to know which setup\nyou would prefer the to or this bomb\ntrack similar yet very different",

Heat.\nBeautiful.\nspot.\nHeat.\nsurrounded by beauty.\nDoesn't matter where you look,\nit's jaw-dropping\nevery direction.\nUnbelievable.\nThis is a magical place.\nAbsolutely magical.\nSo, I didn't do much commentary going up\nthis climb.\nWe're in Oay. I was kind of bummed\nbecause they don't have mountain bike\ntrails around here. It's really a 4x4\ntown. A lot of 4x4 passes and roads.\nSo, I was like, \"What the heck? I'm\ngoing to get out on my bike.\nI'm going to go find some obscure dirt\nroad and ride it and climb it.\nAnd eventually, if I get high enough and\nfar enough, I'm going to have a majestic\nview. And that's exactly what I found.\nAnd as you're watching this right now,\nyou're thinking, \"How can it get better\nthan what he's looking at right now?\"\nWell, it does.\nAnd um I'm on the way back.\nBut I hated to leave the view that I saw\nup there.\nIf you're watching the end of the video\nand seeing this,\nI hope you can see it someday. Make it\nto Colorado.\nThis place is phenomenal. I mean, this\nhas got to be the the most\nimmensely beautiful state in the\ncountry, and it's not even close.\nYou just got to get out.\nDon't just ride the roads. You got to\nget out somehow someway. Get on these\nmountain trails,\nobscure dirt roads, hike,\nwhatever\nway you can to get up in here. In these\nheights and\nbackcountry spaces,\nthe beauty is immense.\nMan, this ride back to town.\nThis was all at my back going up.\nWoo! I didn't realize it was this steep\nwhen I was climbing. It feels a lot\nsteeper when you're going down than when\nyou're climbing up.\nThat is already down there. I don't know\nif you can see it. Let me get a little\ncloser here to the edge, but not too\nclose. That is the town of Ory.\nLet me drop the camera a little bit if\nyou can.\nMaybe you can see it a little better\nnow.\nMaybe not.\nMy hotel is down there.\nI think it was on Seventh Street or\nsomething like that.\nBut that is down there.\nAs you can see, I got to ride. We're way\nsomewhere out in there.\nSee if I can find a better management.\nThat is the town of Oay.\nLet me take a picture.\nOh, let's get back over here.\nOh, this is steep.\nIt must be a climbing machine.\nThere's a little shortcut down through\nthere. I think I can hop over the ledge\nthere on that's what I climbed up back\nin there. It actually wasn't a road.\nThey' graded it over to keep people from\ntraveling it, but I couldn't help\nmyself.\nI was up there.\nDid a little ways over there.\nA lot further than I thought.\nBoxes Canyon.\nThat's what this is known as.\nThis is the million-dollar highway. If\nyou take a right, I do believe.\nI say I mountain biked on the\nmillion-dollar highway.\nProbably not the smartest road.\nGot a brake scrubbing.\nAs long as it works, that's all that\nmatters.\nI'll adjust it.\nmountain biking the million-dollar\nhighway.\nIt gets immensely more beautiful up\nthere, I'm sure. But\nthat's the paved road, and that's\nsomething you could probably come do.\nAnd\num the views are immensely beautiful.\nI've seen videos. A million dollar\nhighway is great. I'll ride you through\ntown real quick. This is the town of\nOay.\nSo,\na lot of cute little shops, a lot of\nlittle t-shirts, a lot of little ins.\nThere's no fancy hotels here. I'll tell\nyou that. Most of them are just old\nschool\nmotel hotel type things, but the\nbuildings are so historic.\nUm,\nBow Mount Hotel. I think that's one of\nthe more popular things as far as a\nlandmark goes.\nthe Orray Brewery. They got a seating\narea upstairs.\nWe didn't go in there, but there was a\nlot of people up there earlier.\nDucket Market. That's the grocery store\nright there on the right.\nAs you can see, just a lot of little\nOur hotel's right down that street to\nthe left. The old Western Hotel there.\nBeautiful white building.\nWe'll come back up the street\nand we're going to eat there tonight at\nthe Gold Belt. Supposedly, it's pretty\ngood. And the biggest plus is they have\na lot of outdoor seating and we have\nmaple. So that's a requirement for us\non this trip\nis outdoor seating. I'll circle around\nright here. But that's the town of Laura\nyou just\nvisited. And I'll um circle right here\nand\nwe'll go back to the hotel.\nI'll show you what the street looks like\non this side.\nWhite caps up there. We overnight that\nwas not white\nin Telluride yesterday, but when we woke\nup this morning in Telleluride, the caps\nof the highest mountains were white.\nLet's see. That's not us,\nbut that is the restaurant we're eating\nat.\nI got to get home and get cleaned up.\nI think I'm the only mountain biker in\ntown.\nI saw that truck 4x4 come up when I was\nup at the viewing spot up there on that\ndirt road. I noticed they had two big\nebikes in the back of the truck,\nbut I'm the only person on the bike\naround here. Let me show you this cool\nhotel.\nWestern Hotel. Is that not cool?\nThis snapshot out of the Old West.\nAnd we are staying down here\nat the River's Edge Lodge. Right here at\nthe base of the mountain, there's a\nlittle river that runs through the back.\nIt's cute little place.\nLet's see.\nI don't want to get back there. I'll go\ndown right here.\nMaple will be excited to see me and I\nwill be excited to tell her and Kesha\nabout what I have seen.\nThanks for coming along with me.",

          "transcript": "Today we've got a really special build.\nWe're building a Parley Aura. It's their\nflagship endurance bike. Really excited\nto get it going. We've got the\ncomponents here. Let's go and get the\nframe.\nHere we have the Parley A. It's a super\nnice, super light endurance frame bike.\nUh it's got clearance for 38 millimeter\ntires front and rear. It's got a nice\nslack, relaxed geometry, so it's\nblurring the lines between a road bike\nand a gravel bike. Plus, it's weighing\nin at under 800 gram. Parlay are an\nAmerican brand and they just specialized\nin super high-end carbon manufacturing.\nU this frame is one of the newer ones\nfrom their range. It's absolutely\nstunning. The bottom bracket is just\nfantastic. It's pinned in. It's super\nclean. And on this finish, you can see\nit's got a raw finish with a wax\ncoating. So, just you can see every\nlittle bit of of the carbon layup on\nthis. And there is literally nothing\nthat the brand wants to hide. Uh that's\nhow good these frames are.\n[Music]\nThe FSA SMR stem on this build is a\nreally neat piece of kit. Um, you can\nrun internal routing either out the back\nof the handlebar like on this FA bar\nhere. So, it comes all the way through\nout there, goes straight down through\nthe headset. Or if you've got a\nnon-compatible bar, you can run a\nstandard bar with this cover that goes\nunder here and the cables will come down\nthe front so you've got a little bit\nmore adjustability. And if you need to\nfly with your bike or swap something\nout, it's less of a faf. All these space\non here are also split spaces. So super\neasy as a mechanic to to change out\nthings without having to fully\ndisassemble the whole bike.\nThis bottom bracket shell is one of the\nsmoothest I've ever had straight out of\nthe the factory. Um, it's a pinned\nsleeve that goes through the bottom the\nthe frame, so it's dead straight, uh,\ndead smooth, and you can guarantee this\nframe is never going to creek.\nCool. So, we've just finished the build\non this Parley Ura. Um, it is a great\nbike. It's was super easy to build.\nEverything just worked perfectly. The\nflat mounts on there were smooth as\nanything. The bottom bracket was\namazing. Uh, and the headset design is\njust really easy to use. Um, this bike\nhas great potential for anyone looking\nfor an all-road bike or even just a\nrelaxed road bike that's got plenty of\ntire clearance and a very accommodating\ngeometry. It does tick a lot of boxes.\nSo, the Parley U is one of the newer\nbikes from Parley. It's handmade in\nPortugal. So, rather than outsourcing\nfor cheap labor in some of the Eastern\ncountries, they've really gone to town\nwith the attention to detail and using\nsome of the highest technology available\nin carbon layup. This is something you\ncan see as well as feel. Like the ride\nfeel on this bike is something very\ndifferent to anything else we've seen.\nUm it's just super compliant while still\nremaining that bit stiff enough that\nit's going to be fun to ride up the\nclimbs. Um tire clearance is is\nfantastic. As with all the the Parley\nbikes, whether you're going gravel road\nor even their aero road bike, they're\nall at least 30 mil tire clearance. This\none here is quoted 38 mm tire clearance,\nbut I reckon you can get a little bit\nbigger in there. Another main benefit of\nbuying a bike from Parley is their\nattention to detail. You get with the\nbike a load of different headset\nadapters, so you can literally run any\ncockpit you want. This is great for us\nbecause we're always trying to find the\nperfect setup for the customer. So\nwhether you want to run a standard bar\nor stem, a semi- integrated system like\nthis, or going full arrow, full\ninternal, there's an option for that. If\nyou enjoyed the bike build content, be\nsure to like and subscribe on YouTube.\nUh we've got plenty more builds coming\nout. And if you are interested in a\ncustom build, whether it's a parley or\none of the different brands we offer,\nthen please feel free to get in contact\nwith",

is this for what kind of\nRider is looking for this bike sure well\nyou know first off uh why on the mono um\nwell you know one piece construction\nreally is the best way to build a bike\nright there's there's no seams there's\nno areas um of you know Bond lines or\njoints and what that means you know it's\nkind of a you know a technical\nMasterpiece but the byproduct is that\nwe're really able to dial in the\nperformance and especially the comfort\nfrom from the bike so we're able to get\nexactly the ride characteristics we want\nand the Cosmetics that we want um so you\nknow what our dealers have been asking\nus for the last couple years is just a\ngreat all rounder you know just an\nallround road bike and it's something\nthat's you know historically been our\nbest selling bike you know if you think\nof uh the zed5 or the Z5 or the altum\nit's always been kind of our number one\nand so this really is the successor to\nthose to those bikes um you know there's\nbeen a lot of influence um you know\nagain from from Riders and from dealers\nthe last couple years that you know have\nkind of shaped the character of this\nbike and you know added some things to\nit that weren't in you know bikes like\nthe Ala um so yeah we're we're really\nexcited it's a it's just an awesome you\nknow I think modern road bike for the\nway our customers want to ride you know\nsure and with that level of monocog\nconstruction you guys are actually\nblending uh different carbon layups for\nsizes right to kind of maintain that\ncharacteristic uh of the parlay uh ride\nquality yeah so I I think the thing you\nknow if you really talk to people who've\nowned M you know many of our bikes over\nthe years the defining characteristics\nof of a parley is that it has great\nperformance but it has an incredible\nlevel of comfort without resorting to\ngimmicks you know like suspension seat\nposts or you know linkages or anything\nlike that the bikes just have a really\ndialed ride quality and that just comes\nfrom the way we tune the the Plies of\ncarbon and the type of carbon you know\nhow much of it and where it's located\nand the angles of all the fibers in\nthere um but kind of to that to that\npoint one of the cool things about this\nconstruction and if you look you know\nkind of in this area here especially in\nthis area you you'll you'll notice that\nthere's no seam or joint in here and\nalmost every carbon bike in the market\nhas a joint in this area and it makes it\nand or sometimes you joints in this area\ntoo makes it really hard to get the the\ncompliance and the comfort in the seat\npost that you want and that's the most\ncritical feature in terms of comfort um\nthis bike because of this type of\nconstruction we're able to get 20% more\ncompliance out of the seat post you know\nwithout changing diameters that's what\nthe exactly the same diameter seat post\nthat we've used round seat post that we\nused on on its predecessors um so that's\nsomething that immediately you know your\nfirst hour on this bike you're going to\nnotice you know that comfort you know\nand we had we didn't have to give up any\nstiffness at the bottom bracket or any\nstiffness you know in the main triangle\nin terms of responsiveness to get that\num so I think that's something that you\nknow our Riders you know our our our\nclients are going to love yeah yeah I'll\nthrow in a couple other little ones that\nare super interesting uh and we're kind\nof happy to see it from you guys we've\ngot a t47 threaded bottom bracket and No\nNonsense round seat post with a clamp uh\nand then a modular front end uh and this\nis not proprietary these are parts that\nuh almost any bike shop can Source uh\nwhich is kind of a wonderful thing so if\nyou buy this bike and for some reason\nyou know you're on a trip or uh move far\naway from a parlay dealer uh you know\nthis is this is something that's built\nto last and will stay around one more\nthing it's got the udh hanger on it\nthere you go you know set up for the\nfuture set up for the future but also\nyou know we've all had this happen I've\nhad it happen pretty recently you know\nyour bike gets you know in the travel\ncase something happens to it TSA does\ntheir magic um you can go anywhere in\nthe world and get one of those hangers\num so we're we're pretty happy with you\nknow the open standard nature of it and\nthat's something that came from talking\nto dealers right I mean that's where you\nknow this bike doesn't happen in a\nvacuum you know and that's why we love\ntalking to you and you know and your\nstaff about hey this is what we want in\nin a bike and and that's another thing\nin terms of comfort that I just want to\nreiterate about this bike and and that's\nthe fit um and we spend a I personally\nspend a lot of time talking to Fitters\nlike you all around the country and all\naround the world saying like hey how can\nwe make this bike fit\nbetter how can we make this bike more\naccessible to more Riders and I think\none of the things you'll notice um you\nknow and we could talk stack and reach\nfor another day um you know the bike\nfits real Riders um but you see a lot\nmore top tube slope on this bike you\nalso see a lower bottom bracket yeah and\nstand over height was something that we\nheard uh over and over again from\ndealers was on a road bike Believe It or\nNot people want more stand over height\nso more that's feedback that we receive\na lot you know with with being custom we\nfind a lot of people that are shorter a\nlot of people that are super tall um and\nthen just oddly dimensioned um which you\ncan't buy the off-the-shelf bike and\nthen with that lower bottom bracket too\nas the tires uh get bigger and bigger\nyou can still maintain that road bike\nfeel yeah yeah and I think I think\nthat's the thing that you'll notice you\nknow yes it has capacity for for really\nbig rubber but it was really designed\nAround Tires you know in that 32 to 35\nmm space yeah um you know and just an\nall you know\nallrounder but I think you'll find if\nyou want to take this out you know on a\ngo fast RP ride and everybody's there on\ntheir go fast bike this bike will be\nperfect for that be perfect for taking\non you know you know Grand Fondo sport\nte centuries um again just an all round\nkind of classic road bike awesome well\nthank you so much for your time Tom hey\nthanks yeah and good luck yeah\nappreciate it",
