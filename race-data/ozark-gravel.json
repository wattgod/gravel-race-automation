Rogers provides adequate staging without the chaos of major destination races. Jacob Ashton's report of falling asleep while descending suggests challenging navigation and course marking, though elite riders like Tom Schwemberger managed despite starting 30 minutes late after doubling back for forgotten gear."

        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "65 miles hits the sweet spot—long enough to matter, short enough to finish without suffering through darkness. Jacob Ashton noted moving for \"nearly 20 hours straight\" on ultra distances, but this shorter format avoids the sleep deprivation issues that plague 400+ mile events. Solid day-long effort that separates casual riders from committed cyclists."
      },
      "technicality": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Arkansas terrain delivers proper technical challenge through the Ozark region's forest roads and doubletrack. As one rider observed: \"I'm confident I would have been faster leaving my 'gravel' bike at the top and trail-running the entire 20-mile segment.\" Ed Rogers switched from gravel to full-suspension MTB between 2023 and 2024, indicating significant technical demands."

      "elevation": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "5000 feet over 65 miles creates serious climbing challenge in the Ozark terrain. Jacob Ashton described \"a number of climbs that easily enter 25%+ grades\" where riders were \"pushing bikes up hills.\" Nic reported that at Horseshoe Canyon, \"the first climbs hit like a brick wall. Singlespeeders of immense accomplishment hopped off before leaving the property.\""

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Arkansas weather creates race-defining challenges, as demonstrated in 2025 when \"biblical rains\" forced a one-day delay. Race day brought \"misting, frozen rains\" with temperatures \"barely above freezing.\" Buffalo River reached flood stage, costing rider Nic his shoe and forcing a scratch at mile 40. Spring races risk severe weather disruption."
      },
      "altitude": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Rogers sits in the eroded Ozark plateau, which as described \"are not 'actual' mountains.\" Zero altitude challenge or acclimatization concerns. The Ozarks exist as \"an ancient, eroded plateau\" worn down by \"millions of years of rain,\" offering elevation gain through steep climbs rather than high-altitude training benefits."
      },
      "adventure": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Arkansas backroads deliver exploration through Ozark terrain with proper backcountry character. Nic described entering \"the alien-like lichen green sprawling over anthracite rock and crag contrasted by the gloom of a dark and dour chasm. It was horrifically magnificent.\" The region offers \"unending, unknowable beauty of the cavernous gorges and canyons\" for shorter-distance adventure."
      },
      "prestige": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "This race doesn't even show up in searches—that tells you everything about its prestige. While Northwest Arkansas has built legitimate cycling credibility through events like the OZ Trails system, this particular 65-miler isn't making waves. No notable winners, no coverage, no buzz in the gravel community that matters."
      },
      "race_quality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Organization shows mixed results based on rider reports. Tom Schwemberger won despite mechanical failures and starting late due to forgotten gear, suggesting flexible race management. However, navigation errors occurred where riders found themselves \"re-routing on the Ozark National Forest hiking trail\" after missing course markers, indicating room for improvement in route marking."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Arkansas gravel delivers memorable challenge through Ozark terrain and community atmosphere. The pre-race gremlin bell ceremony has \"EVERY rider walk around their bikes ringing them to ward off evil spirits\" before departure. Race director Andrew creates an aesthetic where \"what we're doing out here is badass,\" backed by terrain that demands respect."

      "community": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "The Ozark gravel scene has built authentic community since 2023 through events like the gremlin bell ceremony where \"grown-ass adults are walking around in circles ringing bells.\" Race director Andrew Onerma embodies grassroots culture, \"waiting in the dark, offering hugs and beers at the barn.\" Northwest Arkansas cycling infrastructure supports welcoming community atmosphere."
      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Unknown field size and zero documented fast riders means you're racing against weekend warriors. Regional events like Doom attract serious ultra-endurance athletes, but this 65-miler isn't drawing talent. Expect local club riders looking for Saturday adventure, not competitive depth."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Arkansas events deliver solid value through challenging terrain and memorable experiences like the gremlin bell ceremony where Andrew \"passes out gremlin bells 15 minutes before the race starts.\" The region offers 5000 feet of climbing and Ozark backcountry exploration without premium destination race pricing, though specific entry fees remain unavailable."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Rogers sits in accessible Northwest Arkansas with reasonable lodging and XNA airport proximity. Not a budget-buster destination, but not dirt cheap either. Mid-tier cycling region pricing without the premium markup of established gravel hotspots."
