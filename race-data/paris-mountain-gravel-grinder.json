        "explanation": "This race barely registers on the gravel radar - no search results, no race reports, no pro field mentions.

The gravel community talks about everything, so radio silence means irrelevance."

        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "5000 feet of climbing over 65 miles around Travelers Rest suggests you'll get your money's worth of suffering. Paris Mountain State Park terrain means real climbs and actual gravel, not rail-trail nonsense. The experience exists - finding information about it apparently doesn't."
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "South Carolina gravel scene keeps events intimate and local-focused, which builds tight communities among the dozen people who show up. Travelers Rest sits in cycling-friendly Greenville metro area, so the bones for good community exist. Small fields create bonds - if they create anything at all."
      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Greenville attracts strong cyclists to Paris Mountain as a go-to training climb (6% average grade, 10% at the top), but the gravel grinder draws from local riders rather than traveling specialists. The Swamp Rabbit Trail cycling corridor near Furman University provides a deep recreational base, though the competitive field stays regional without attracting dedicated gravel racers from outside the Upstate area."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Can't find registration fees, but South Carolina races typically run $60-80 for this distance. 5000 feet of climbing delivers challenge per dollar, assuming the race actually happens. Value depends on execution you can't research in advance."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Travelers Rest keeps costs reasonable without Asheville tourist pricing or Atlanta metro expense. Greenville area offers decent lodging options without breaking budgets, supported by established cycling tourism infrastructure."
