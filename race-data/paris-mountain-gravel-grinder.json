More climbing than SBT GRVL at the same score."

The gravel community talks about everything, so radio silence means irrelevance."

        "explanation": "5000 feet of climbing over 65 miles around Travelers Rest suggests you'll get your money's worth of suffering.

      },
      "community": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "South Carolina gravel scene keeps events intimate and local-focused, which builds tight communities among the dozen people who show up. Travelers Rest sits in cycling-friendly Greenville metro area, so the bones for good community exist. Small fields create bonds - if they create anything at all."

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Greenville attracts strong cyclists to Paris Mountain as a go-to training climb (6% average grade, 10% at the top), but the gravel grinder draws from local riders rather than traveling specialists. The Swamp Rabbit Trail cycling corridor near Furman University provides a deep recreational base, though the competitive field stays regional without attracting dedicated gravel racers from outside the Upstate area. Less competitive depth than Almanzo 100."

      "value": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Can't find registration fees, but South Carolina races typically run $60-80 for this distance. 5000 feet of climbing delivers challenge per dollar, assuming the race actually happens. Value depends on execution you can't research in advance."

        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Registration runs $60-100. Travelers Rest keeps costs reasonable without Asheville tourist pricing or Atlanta metro expense.

They also helped our family during the evacuation shuffle so myself and few bros went out and test rode the Eroica: Heroic Route. \n\nThe problem with this cycling route though, was that it was designed for a Fondo, where each winery had rest stops. But in Vegan Cyclist fashion, we just sent it and hoped for the best.\n\nWe only had one rest stop on this cycling adventure , which was actually a detour, but what an amazing route. You can check other routes at www.cyclecentralcoast.com or follow my strava (https://www.strava.com/activities/4056700794) but beware that our route had literally ZERO stops, we had to detour to find one.  \n\n0:00 Talking Head\n2:08 Ride Starts\n4:50 Gravel Climb\n7:56 Rider Bio\n9:55 Finding Food\n12:34 Family Stuff\n\nIf you want to see the daily vlogging of the evacuation shuffle, check out my Instagram Highlights here, there's 7 different highlights. \nP1 https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/17850383765321954/\nP2 https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/17928348784429478/\nP3 https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/17887148416691177/\nP4 https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/17879461591812812/\nP5 https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/17864052494078919/\nP6 https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/18162689275050162/\nP7 https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/17879345329814860/ \n\n#cycling #roadcycling #cyclingvlog\n\n//////www.Whoop.com /\nhttps://bit.ly/2UXZ8zN follow this link and use code \"vegan15\" to get 15% off any membership\n\n//////The best kits in the world\nwww.ElielCycling.com - code veganbro10\n\n/////Hella sick Shirts n stuff\nhttps://www.ridebikesbro.com\n\n/////Recovery Shakes\nhttps://kyoku.com/ (Code \"thevegancyclist\" for 15% off)\n\nfollow me bruh\nhttps://www.facebook.com/theVeganCyclist\nhttps://www.strava.com/athletes/180549\nhttps://www.instagram.com/the_vegan_cyclist/",

          "transcript": "all right so this is our\nfourth different place we've stayed in\nthe last seven days\nand what's strange is how\nwhy do i have so much stuff like we've\nbeen living for seven days and i i\nhaven't used\n95 of my stuff so probably moving\nforward i need to\nconsolidate my stuff so anyway\nthey're um we're gonna go for a big ride\ntoday we're gonna go about 107 miles\n[Music]\ncycle central coast they're tied in with\nthe tourism board\nand they they've been huge finding dog\nfriendly hotels uh but again there isn't\navailability like for a week or two\nso we're kind of been jumping from one\nplace to another place\nyou know every day or two days we go to\na new hotel into town\nand that's kind of taking its toll on us\na little bit but we've sort of gotten\ninto the groove i think\nsorry bumper zoe\nyou know we've got three dogs and i\ndon't really talk about the dogs that\nmuch but that is\nthat is really been difficult to try to\nmake sure that they're happy and they're\ngood and that we can stay somewhere that\nis\ndog friendly the other thing is my whoop\nso i use whoop to track my fitness and\nand all that\nso usually my recovery scores like i\nnever have green\noften if i go and do a big hard ride the\nnext day i'm\nalways in the gutter but for whatever\nreason since we've been here\nmy recovery scores are through the roof\nlike no matter what big ass ride i do\nit's always like green or like ready to\nperform\nso i'm not sure if that's the elevation\nbecause i live at 3 400 feet\nand that you wouldn't think that would\nbe that big of a difference but\ni don't know why i feel so good down\nhere i've been feeling\nso amazing i've been i don't know\nit's hard to explain and the whoop is\nshowing that something is different\nso\nthis is this climb santa rosa creek the\nsteep part\nis so steep and i know i'm walking my\nbike here for a second it makes me look\nlike a total fred but\ni can't talk to the camera ain't like\nit's it's so steep you have to\nbe fully out of the saddle uh my best\ntime up this is 11 minutes\ni think phil just did it nine or\nsomething stupid\nsomething so crazy\nwhat'd you what'd you think of that\nclimb uh it was\nit was weird we were talking about it\nlike the the parts that weren't as steep\nfelt flat because the portions that were\nseeped were just like\nstraight up\nalrighty so now we've done santa rosa\ncreek\ngreat climb around this area we came\ndown old creek\nnow we're going to go up to santa rita\nwhich is gravel this road\ncan be done on any bike i would say if\nyou can only do one\nof the roads santa rosa's old creek or\nsanta rita santa rita is the way to go\nit's quiet it's beautiful you go down\nover the other side and then you can get\ninto\nsanta margherita lots of santa's around\nhere\nthe other thing is sometimes dude do you\never just get so\nhappy during a ride like right now i'm\njust bubbling\nwith happiness it's like\nwhich is good\nokay that's santa rita road oh man it is\nso good\nhighly recommend you do this if you're\nin the area\nthe view is insane and again the dirt is\nnot\nlike you don't need a gravel bike you\ncan do a road bike no problem\nthen you're gonna descend off this back\nside and go to santa margarita for some\nmargaritas\nis there a reason you don't run tubeless\nyou just haven't set it up\nso that's what i think that's common\nlike a lot of people say i haven't\ngotten around to setting it up\nand honestly it can be a nightmare if\nyou don't get it right\nyour first experience with tubeless\ncould be terrible but once you get it\ndialed once you have the right tires\ni mean i i don't think i've flatted\nother than i just flatted two days ago\nbut it was on those were on like super\nrace tires and i was coming down this\nroad\nbut if like you have like i have irc x\nguards\ni mean i haven't flatted in like three\nyears it's kind of nuts\nright here the plug system got five\nshots at it\nso that goes in this little guy comes\nout cut the excess off\ninflator and\nthis is just one of them rides man where\nit's like because it's not overly\ndifficult and you're just enjoying the\nscenery i mean\nit's so nice out here\nyes dude\nall right man tell me a little bit about\nyour story you uh how old are you\nuh 22. and you're already strong as\nso how did you get into cycling did you\nhave some sort of fitness background\nyeah i grew up playing tennis um did\nthat\npretty much from like the age of six\nuntil like i was 18 19. i wanted to kind\nof train for something so i kind of\ntrained for the bass lake triathlon\ni say train i kind of decided to do it\nlike a month before i started\nthe swimming and the running was fun but\nlike i absolutely love like\nthe cycling portion but i mean i wasn't\ni never really\ntook it seriously i didn't have a bike i\nwas riding my dad's bike which is like a\n60 frame\nlike after doing the half iron man i was\nlike\nnah i just want to do cycling so kind of\ntook a couple months off it's just\nfinishing off my semester\nand then uh april i like started riding\nquite a bit on my own and then\ngot a coach in may and here we are\nso this uh route is pretty sweet but\nthere is like no towns\nthere's no stops and it looks like\nthere's some wineries and so maybe\nthat's\nwhere you're supposed to stop and refuel\nbut i'm not really trying to\ndrink a bottle of wine on the ride\nwe're kind of lost we're out of water if\nyou were into it\nyou could stop here and have a full-on\nlunch but on 107 mile ride i don't know\na full-on wine and lunch is the\nright call but i feel like you would\nnever get up from your chair\nthis would be the destination we\ndefinitely took some sort of tour of\nwineries\nwhich i'm sure is cool but we don't want\nwine and we don't want cheese\nyou know what i mean so\nwe need sugar\nthis route is very scenic doesn't have a\nwhole lot of stops\nroughly zero of them i've never seen\nthis in a gas station\nbut they're plant-based meal bars wild\nblueberry banana walnut\nmango coconut almond cranberry you know\nthey say you shouldn't go shopping if\nyou're hungry\nbecause you buy you don't eat like\ni bought all of them the banana now\nbanana walnut\nit's everything i hoped it would be\nthey were just advising me not to put\nthis on film\nbut so i my chain just all of a sudden\nlike out of nowhere got\nsuper dry so i'm using i mean all i have\nis this two-stroke oil\nso he's an idiot\noh no no no okay well\nthat was a brutal brutal climb\nvery technical very\nsteep very gravelly but it's beautiful\nup here\nand the breakaway wins yeah that put\ndown\n341 normalized for the last 30 minutes\nreally\nyeah that like felt great at the end wow\ndid mark is the strongest human ever\nat the end of that ride him putting out\nso much power\nthe thing is and i already said this\nthat course\ni it's like it was for a fondo and that\nall the wineries would have like\nrest stops on a 100 plus mile ride did\nyou like to\nmaybe stop twice there's some really\ncool points to that route\nbut it needs to be amended for someone\nwho's not going to stop at wineries i\nthink i've already said that a bunch\nso let's go to dinner\nhow are you dealing with not being\nin a specific place more than two days\nfor me the biggest hurdle is that i\nnever\nget time just alone for a couple minutes\nso when you're in your house\nyou can go in your room maybe the kids\nare watching tv and you can go outside i\ncan water the plants\ngo check the mail like whatever it's\ntime alone\nand when you're in a hotel especially\nwith your family\nthere's no separation and so that's\ndefinitely difficult\nyou know there are some things i feel\nguilty about when i think about back\nhome\nbut right now it's more about\nthem and keeping them happy and keeping\nthem entertained\nit's your cool vacation but\nif i had the option to go home i'll be\nup\nwhat do you think baby how are you doing\ngood what's\nso difficult is not having a base camp\nnot having a routine\nevery day it's something new\nnew hurdles you know even just new\nexcitement\nbut there's not we haven't stayed in a\nplace longer than two days\nso it's like you get one night and then\nand in one hotel we actually had to move\nhotels\ntwice uh during that stay so it's like\njust moving all the stuff so you almost\ndon't even want to unpack\npeople are like oh it's just stuff but\nto me like my stuff that makes me sad\nbecause my stuff\nis an accumulation of things that i love\nlike books that i love\num things that i found at the antique\nstore that i love that are one of a kind\nso to me there's so much in the house\nand then that's what's sad about\npeople who lost their houses is that\nyour house is full of stuff that\nreflects you\nthat's special one-of-a-kind things and\nthose aren't really things that you can\nreplace\nso that's definitely stressful because\nyou can't pack all that\nwe just pack the things that are super\nimportant\nmemories pictures or christmas ornaments\nthings like that\ndid you ride all day yeah\nso as of right now even if they lifted\nthe\nmandatory evacuation the smoke there is\nlike it was 500\nthe air quality was 500. you can't live\nin air quality of 500.\nso even if they lifted the mandatory\nevacuation still can't go back\nso as of right now we're going to play\nit by ear until wednesday and see how\nthat goes\nso anyway as always vegan cyclists\ni was ready to go to avila\nhard to see but hearst castle had a\nbunch of zebras\nsee the zebras out there being zebras\nyou're my son he's the most hipster kid\non the planet\nlet's see he's getting to play with his\npit and that's huge dude that's\nhuge for his mental health\nso what's strange is that when we first\nembarked on this\ni think we're like day eight now",
