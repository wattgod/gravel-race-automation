That rail trail lulls you into thinking this is easy, then the farm lanes add rolling punches before the finish climb separates the wheat from the chaff. 4,000 feet over 62 miles isn't Alpine, but it's placed precisely where it hurts most."

Recent years delivered \"three days of rain\" creating total mudfests or the rare warm year that still leaves tacky, bike-clogging clay.
