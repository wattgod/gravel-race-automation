          "transcript": "[Music]\nnorthern europe has been home to some of\nthe most brutal bike races for years\nwe've got strada bianchi we've got torah\nflanders milan san remo paris roubaix\nwell today i'm not in northern europe\ni'm in north america to take part in a\nrace that has been inspired by the\nbrutalness of pariru bay\ni'm going to tackle some of the toughest\nfarm lanes trails tracks and grabba\nroads canada has to offer\nthis is the og of gravel racing this is\nparis to ancaster\ndown there\nliterally the best group of people ever\noh my god i've never felt pain like this\nthat\nwas a brutal 100 kilometers\nparis ancaster was a gravel race before\ngravel races even existed a mixture of\nroad gravel and technical sections that\nattracted nearly 3 000 riders each year\nthe race is in the heart of ontario\ncanada it runs between the town of paris\nand ancaster and it has four different\nlengths to suit all abilities when the\nlovely people of this event got in touch\nwith us and asked if we wanted to take\npart we couldn't say no so tomorrow i'm\ngoing to be taking part in the 100\nkilometer route but before i start let's\nfind out how this unique race came about\nwell the race came about in 1994 and it\nwas myself and a couple old friends uh\ndecided to put something on a little\nearlier in the season and we were\nactually uh sort of copying perry bay at\nthe time a tribute race\nfor the first bunch of years we ran it\non the same date as perry rip a and then\nbeing canada we decided that was\nactually even colder than in france so\nwe moved it to later in april\ni think the real reason it works that\nwell is it's uh you're racing the same\ncourse same day same time as the pros so\neverybody's out here and they're not all\nequals because some of the riders are\nreally top riders but they all feel like\nthey're part of the same event um\nand everybody has their own experience\nin it so they all have their own epic\nride\nokay so night before the event\nand just got back to the hotel after a\nday's filming and it is 10 o'clock 3 a.m\nin the uk\nso quite tired quite jet lagged but just\ngonna get everything ready for the event\ntomorrow\nall right\nit's time to get some sleep\nit's the morning of the race we were up\nat the crack of dawn and people were\nflooding in and the atmosphere it was\nbuilding\nokay so number on bike all set up\nchanged ready to go got 20 minutes till\nthe start\nstart to feel a little bit nervous i'm\noff in the first wave so with some of\nthe\nthe proper pros\ni'm not sure what the start is going to\nbe like but i've been told\nit's carnage\ni guess we better better get down\nthere are so many people here it's gonna\nbe absolutely carnage\nso i'm kind of excited so let's get to\nit\nit was a super fast start to the race\nand the first bit was on gravels he had\nstones flying everywhere and it was\npretty cornish but then we hit a nice\nbig wide road section and i was like\nright this is my chance get near the\nfront and stay out of trouble and i mean\ni was um\ntrying to hold my own within the pro\npeloton but um it was it was tough going\nthey were going super fast\nlooking forward to hitting the first big\ngravel\nall going good so far still in the\nmain bench\nnot sure how long i can stay at though\nit was really cool that the male and\nfemale riders all started together so\nthat doesn't really happen that often in\npro races so it was nice to do something\na little bit different\nso in 2014 uh paris and cancer was the\nfirst professional race i ever won at\nthat point i was new on a professional\nteam and the beginning of my season had\nbeen a disaster i kept crashing and\nbreaking bones and getting sick and\nhaving no results and then i came here\nand there were a few really established\nprofessional cyclographs racers from\neurope that were there\nand i managed to get a getaway at the at\nthe finish line and just win the race\nand for me this really flipped the\nswitch and\nallowed me to have more confidence and\njust then it kind of kick-started my\ncareer so i really have good memories of\nthis race\ni managed to stay with that front group\nfor about 40 minutes and\nwhen i was there i was like i'm probably\ngoing a little bit too hard i can't\nsustain this for 100 kilometers but\neventually we went a bit of an incline\nand i kind of\ngot dropped\nit's annoying because i can see them\njust up ahead so i've got a little grip\ngoing we're gonna try and uh\ndo our best to get back on\nbut my way that was a fast old start\nafter about 35 kilometers of nice big\nwide open roads and gravel tracks we\nfinally hit our first\nnarrow single track lane so positioning\nwas really crucial going into this bit\n[Applause]\n38 kilometers\ninto the race going good so far looking\nforward to\nhitting some of those\nmuddy shoots that everybody's been\nchatting about\nbut um\nhaven't seen any canadian mooses yet a\nlittle disappointing but you know i'll\nunderstand they didn't want to come out\ntoday\nso yeah doing good\nwe then hit some of the more\ntechnical parts and it was really wet\nand boggy\nand i actually hit one massive bog and i\nhad to get off and walk and the only way\nthrough\nwas me getting my feet soaking wet\nwith black mud so that was my feet wet\nfor the rest of the race which was\nlovely i then had to get off and jump\nover the biggest tree i've ever seen it\nhonestly it was about this high i could\nhave done with a ladder to get over it\nbut um got the bike on the shoulder\ngot over\ndid a cycle cross hop onto the bike and\ngot going again\nthis such a great community spirit about\nthis race like everywhere in the course\nthere's people cheering on and they\nthey'll be out there all day watching\nevery single person like close to 3 000\npeople go past and it was the course was\namazing such a variety of roads gravel\ntracks a forest we even went through\nlike people's back gardens\nwell the course is actually based around\nsome old railway lines originally\nrunning from paris paris to ancaster and\nthen we've tied in gravel roads and uh\nfarmers lanes and private properties and\nover the years we've uh we've used quite\na few different landowners over the\nyears uh they've been unbelievable uh\nreceptive to letting us ride through\ntheir properties and\nthat's really developed a big community\nof parasite and kesha community over the\nyears\nfeels like kind of like the whole\nsurrounding area stops for this race\nbecause this is a big thing in this area\nall right good three hours in now\nand\ni'm running out of gas\nokay i'm now at\nfive kilometers\nto go and\ni have bonked\nso hard\ni've just eaten i didn't stuff my face\nthere was people on the side of the road\nwith candy\nso i literally just took took some\nshoved it down me and hopefully that's\ngoing to give me some energy\nto get to the finish but\noh\nit's hard going\nso i saw the mud shoots and i saw people\ngo down\nand they were just crashing so i decided\nto play it safe and hop off the bike and\nwalk down i came this far and i didn't\nreally want to mess it up\njust hit\none of the famous\nmud shoots\ni mean there's a few people riding down\nbut\ni'm not getting too far because it's\npretty deep\ndeep mud\nyeah just impossible to ride down\num without without falling off so\ngo in for the old\nwalking technique but\njust see how deep this mud is\nabsolutely savage\nwow\nthen it was the final brutal climb to\nthe finish but there was so many people\non the sides of the climb cheering you\non and it was a really good atmosphere\nit felt like you know finished like a\nbig race and everybody had cowbells and\nit was an amazing atmosphere so it's\nreally nice to have that encouragement\ngot to the line\nand i've completed paris to ancaster\nthat was the most brutal finish to a\nbike race\ni think i've ever done\nlike my my legs up that hill were\nscreaming\nso many people having to walk up but\nthankfully stayed on my bike but\nonce i got my breath back i decided to\ncatch up with the winners of my category\nmike vanderham and magley rochette\nfirstly congratulations on the wayne how\nwas it out there for you today uh it's\nwell first off it's so great to be back\nracing this event they've had to cancel\nthe last couple and like paris and is\nalways one of my favorite events to go\nto just because of the weird sort of mix\nof road racing gravel racing cross\neverything out there and also because\nthere's like 3 000 people here and you\nknow\na lot of them are cyclists there's a\nbunch of pros here but a lot of them are\njust like people in the community who\nare like you know what i'm training\ncomparison caster this year like i'm\ngonna do it and\nthat's cool\ni don't know if it feels just as special\nto win it again today um it's really\ncool because i mean it's always good for\nthe confidence to do a good race and\nhave good results but i think for me\nthis year it's mostly about reconnecting\nwith the canadian community of cyclists\ni'm from canada and i know they cheer me\non when i race on the world cup and they\nalways write me on instagram and on\nsocial media but i rarely get to race in\ncanada so doing an event like this with\nis which is really focused on community\nwith over 2 000 racers it's really fun\nfor me to chat with everyone and meet\neveryone and yeah when i get to take the\nwin it's just even better you know it's\njust the cherry on the cake\nthere we have it i completed paris to\nancaster thank you so much to the event\norganizers for inviting us out to do\nthis brilliant race and if you're\nthinking about taking part next year\njust bite the bullet and do it you will\nnot regret it it's a brilliant\natmosphere here and everybody really\ndoes get behind each other so let me\nknow down in that comment section what\nyou thought of my efforts and if you did\nenjoy this video make sure to give it a\nbig thumbs up\ni'm off to find some maple syrup\nbye",

ahead watch your\nright\noh your B your bike sounds like angry oh\nman hard you're doing awesome you're on\nthe 110 huh yeah you're doing\nawesome and there you guys have it uh\nthat's Paris Ancaster\n2024 and so you might have noticed that\nthe footage just stopped abruptly at the\naround 80 km Mark out of my 114 km ride\nuh the GoPro battery died there was a\nfeed station roughly around that spot uh\nI opted not to stop I was pacing fairly\nwell I ended up um ending the event at a\ntime of 3 hours and 51 minutes uh for\nthe entire\n114k and so that actually placed me 34\nor 36 out of 120 Riders so um I think I\nmade the right decision uh what footage\nthat we did Miss uh there's the three\nmud shoots uh the second one uh did get\nme uh it was a big sort of downhill\nshoot uh which included a log that was\nburied in about a foot and a half of mud\nand so I hit that pretty hard went over\nthe bars ate it fully covered in mind um\nphotographers were on site but\nunfortunately I could not find those\npictures and so I guess I'll have to go\nback next year and uh hopefully or\nhopefully not eat it again uh anyways\nbig shout out to the the townships or\ncities of Paris and Caster uh everybody\nin between citizens uh OPP uh really\nwell organized event uh there was a roll\nen closures uh that kind of followed\nalong the routs the 40 70 and 100 or in\nthis case 114k routs all kind of fed\ninto each other and so whichever\ndistance you choose you'll end up\nhitting those big features and so um I\nwish I would have captured those but I\nwould I would say is any of the sort of\nvideos that you'll see linked up after\nthis um there's also Roy ridings\nAdventure there's Oliver Dunham uh and a\nfew other folks who I know um have\ncaptured this event as well uh and so\nhopefully you can kind of see what those\num those sort of um Ambush sections look\nlike uh but uh all that to say thank you\nvery much for watching I will be setting\nup next year it'll be part of my regular\nrotation and if you have never done it\nbefore I strongly recommend it so uh\nthank you for so much for watching and\nuh more footage or more videos to come\num uh we've got our Reggie ramble big uh\nred gravel we've got our own sort of\nstuff that we kind of like to do and so\nhopefully you stick around and watch us\nagain so thanks again for watching take\ncare\nbye it's not\nbad all right it's not so bad look at\nthat\nw",
