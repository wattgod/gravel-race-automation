        "score": 2,

        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "This is the 6th annual edition of a Pennsylvania Gravel Series race in Penfield, PA. No notable past winners documented, no pro field data, no YouTube coverage. It's a regional series race that hasn't broken into the national conversation."

      "race_quality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Trans-Sylvania Productions delivers chip timing, well-marked course, and fully stocked aid stations with reasonable cutoffs. Limited to 300 participants with organized registration system - solid execution of basic gravel race infrastructure without standout operational features."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "You get an event shirt, post-race meal, and awards for top 3 finishers in each category. S.B. Elliott State Park provides a decent venue, but no unique course features are documented. Solid small-town gravel race experience without memorable elements."
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Part of the Pennsylvania Gravel Series as Race #2, which creates some regional continuity. Visit Clearfield County sponsors it, suggesting local support. But no rider reviews, forum buzz, or community reputation data available - feels like a quiet local scene."
      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Field size data completely unavailable, no mention of competitive riders or pro participation. Being a small Pennsylvania town race in its 6th year without documented fast fields suggests limited depth."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Registration includes shirt, chip timing, post-race meal, aid stations, and awards - solid package for what's likely modest entry fees. Three distance options (23, 52, or 72 miles) give flexibility. Early bird pricing with only $10 increase shows reasonable fee structure."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Penfield, PA keeps lodging and dining costs reasonable compared to destination races. Visit Clearfield County sponsorship suggests local accommodation options exist - rural Pennsylvania location controls expenses though specific pricing data unavailable."
