It's part of the Ironbear 1000 challenge, which adds some credibility, but that's more about grinding through events than earning bragging rights."

      "race_quality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Self-supported format with a flexible two-week window screams 'we're not really organizing much here.' No aid stations, no official timing, no structured race infrastructure. You get a route and a vague group start option on June 1st at 7am if you want company."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Pickerel sits in northern Wisconsin's legitimate gravel country with river crossings and terrain that IRONBULL describes as challenging. The flexible format lets you ride it how you want without race-day pressure. It's more adventure ride than competitive suffering, which works if that's what you're after."

      "community": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "IRONBULL has built a solid Wisconsin gravel series, and the group ride option creates some camaraderie without the ego drama. The self-supported format attracts riders who want the challenge without the competitive posturing. Small but committed community that knows Wisconsin gravel."
      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "No competitive element means no competitive field. You're riding with whoever shows up for the group start or crossing paths with others doing it solo during the two-week window. Think weekend warriors and adventure seekers, not racers hunting KOMs."

      "value": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "No entry fee information available, but IRONBULL events typically run reasonable. You're paying for route curation and series participation, not race production overhead. 40 miles of northern Wisconsin gravel with river crossings delivers solid riding per dollar."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Pickerel, Wisconsin isn't exactly a tourism hub with abundant lodging options. You're looking at driving distance or camping scenarios for most riders. Remote location means limited food and accommodation choices, driving up your weekend costs."
      },
      "length": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "40 miles is a solid morning ride, not a day-long suffer fest. With 2500 feet of elevation, you're done by lunch even if you're taking photos at the river crossing. Good for testing legs or easy adventure, but won't leave you with war stories."
      },
      "technicality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Wisconsin gravel with a river crossing suggests some variety beyond straight farm roads. IRONBULL calls it challenging terrain, but northern Wisconsin isn't known for technical rock gardens or steep descents. Expect rolling gravel with some character, nothing that requires mountain bike skills."
      },
      "elevation": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "2500 feet over 40 miles averages out to rolling terrain, not lung-burning climbs. Wisconsin's northern woods provide more elevation change than the southern farm country, but you're not getting mountain training here. Enough to feel it, not enough to break you."
      },
      "climate": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Late May to mid-June in northern Wisconsin hits the sweet spot before summer heat and humidity. You might catch some spring weather variability, but you're generally looking at pleasant riding temperatures. The two-week window lets you dodge bad weather days."
      },
      "altitude": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Pickerel sits in Wisconsin's northern lowlands, probably under 1500 feet elevation. Zero altitude training benefit, zero acclimatization concerns. Your sea-level lungs work just fine here."
      },
      "logistics": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Self-supported format eliminates most logistics headaches - no packet pickup, no race morning rush, no aid station timing. The flexible window means you pick your day and start when you want. Simple approach that removes barriers, though you're on your own for everything else."
      },
      "adventure": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "River crossing adds some character, and northern Wisconsin's gravel roads deliver prettier scenery than farm country loops. But 40 miles in familiar Midwest terrain isn't pushing any boundaries. It's a nice day out, not an expedition into the unknown."
