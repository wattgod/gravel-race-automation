        "explanation": "Girona is the cycling capital of Europe with excellent infrastructure. Barcelona El Prat (118 km) offers international flights; Girona airport closer but limited. Sea Otter Europe festival brings 68,000+ visitors creating accommodation pressure - one rider reports they 'couldn't sleep more than 4 hours the night before the race' due to festival atmosphere."

        "explanation": "At 340 km with a 20-hour time limit, this pushes deep into ultra-distance territory. One rider described it as 'one the harder that we have done until now' after completing with an experienced brevet fanatic. Jordi Riera Valls covered the full distance in 13 hours 50 minutes, demonstrating the gap between elite and recreational pacing. Among the longest in gravel, comparable to Badlands. As Sleep Deprivation puts it: \"We only could sleep 4 hours the night before the race but we tried to be ready on time for start line and keep our mind aware for the first part of the ride.\""

Tom Owen rode it on 25c tires with a 1990s steel road bike, noting it 'proved anything but nimble; it felt practically lethal on rocky descents.' The final 49km features single-track sections ridden 'really fast' in darkness toward Girona. Similar technical demands to Gravel Worlds. As Tom Owen puts it: \"I rode the Pirinexus, or my version of it, on a steel frame Decathlon road bike from the 1990s...\""

        "score": 4,

Riders report this stretch as 'really hard and a huge nightmare for a lot of participants' with 23km of gravel climbing. Many DNF at this point, though reaching the summit means 'you knew you could finish the race on time.' More climbing than SBT GRVL at the same score.

However, Tom Owen's early spring attempt saw water bottles and breakfast bananas freeze overnight. The night finish portion adds cold exposure risk after 12+ hours of exertion. Similar climate challenges to SBT GRVL. As Timo Rokitta puts it: \"An ice-cold wind was blowing and the view was fantastic [at Col d'Ares]. On the very long descent it slowly got warmer and warmer.\""

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Col d'Ares peaks at 1,513m with most of the route at lower elevations. The altitude itself poses minimal physiological challenge - the difficulty lies in the climbing effort rather than thin air. Start and finish at sea level in Girona with moderate mountain passes throughout. Modest altitude compared to Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

        "score": 5,
        "explanation": "The route crosses volcanic zones, Pyrenean passes, medieval villages, and Costa Brava coastline in a single push.

The night finish through single-track creates a memorable conclusion to an epic journey."

          "description": "The CANYON PIRINEXUS CHALLENGE is currently a personal non-stop challenge of 340km. Participants will have until midnight to complete a route that takes in all types of terrain. All bikes are allowed, although probably the most appropriate are the gravel or the cyclo-cross bikes. Road bikes with 28 (or 25) tyres and mountain bikes 29’ wheels with slicks.\n\nParticipants will leave the sea and head inland into the regions of Girona following the course of the Ter river up to the Colomers dam. Once there, the course will turn left towards Les Gavarres mountains. It will then mainly run along the crest of the mountain in an easterly direction, enjoying views of the El Gironès and L’Empordà regions whilst surrounded by cork oaks. All the tracks are in very good condition and have low technical difficulty.",
