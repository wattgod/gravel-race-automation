        "explanation": "Girona is the cycling capital of Europe with excellent infrastructure. Barcelona El Prat (118 km) offers international flights; Girona airport closer but limited. Sea Otter Europe festival brings 68,000+ visitors creating accommodation pressure - one rider reports they 'couldn't sleep more than 4 hours the night before the race' due to festival atmosphere."
      },
      "length": {
        "score": 5,
        "explanation": "At 340 km with a 20-hour time limit, this pushes deep into ultra-distance territory. One rider described it as 'one the harder that we have done until now' after completing with an experienced brevet fanatic. Jordi Riera Valls covered the full distance in 13 hours 50 minutes, demonstrating the gap between elite and recreational pacing."
      },
      "technicality": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Mixed terrain with 55% gravel proves challenging but manageable. Tom Owen rode it on 25c tires with a 1990s steel road bike, noting it 'proved anything but nimble; it felt practically lethal on rocky descents.' The final 49km features single-track sections ridden 'really fast' in darkness toward Girona."
      },
      "elevation": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "The 3,400m of climbing centers on a brutal 50km section from Ceret to Col d'Ares. Riders report this stretch as 'really hard and a huge nightmare for a lot of participants' with 23km of gravel climbing. Many DNF at this point, though reaching the summit means 'you knew you could finish the race on time.'"
      },
      "climate": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "June 2019 riders enjoyed 'very pleasant temperatures, without too much heat' during the day. However, Tom Owen's early spring attempt saw water bottles and breakfast bananas freeze overnight. The night finish portion adds cold exposure risk after 12+ hours of exertion."
      },
      "altitude": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Col d'Ares peaks at 1,513m with most of the route at lower elevations. The altitude itself poses minimal physiological challenge - the difficulty lies in the climbing effort rather than thin air. Start and finish at sea level in Girona with moderate mountain passes throughout."
      },
      "adventure": {
        "score": 5,
        "explanation": "The route crosses volcanic zones, Pyrenean passes, medieval villages, and Costa Brava coastline in a single push. Riders describe crossing diverse terrain types within the time limit, from gravel climbs through French borders to coastal approaches. The night finish through single-track creates a memorable conclusion to an epic journey."
      },
      "prestige": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Part of UCI Gravel World Series and integrated with Sea Otter Europe festival. Seven editions have established its reputation among European ultra-endurance cyclists. The event attracts 'cyclists from various areas of Europe' and provides exclusive Bioracer jerseys designed specifically for the challenge."
      },
      "race_quality": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Well-organized with Shimano mechanical support throughout the route and multiple aid stations. Sea Otter Europe backing provides professional race infrastructure. Two basic provisioning points serve the non-stop format, though riders can arrange personal support teams for the extended challenge."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 5,
        "explanation": "Riders finish 'tired but happy and excited' after conquering Col d'Ares - the mental milestone that determines completion. The night riding finale through single-track toward Girona creates shared suffering and accomplishment. Participants consistently highlight 'the toughness of the course' while demonstrating it's achievable with proper training."
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Growing European participation with Friday evening race number pickup and exclusive jersey distribution creating pre-race atmosphere. Elite riders like Tom Owen and competitive cyclists like Jordi Riera Valls participate alongside recreational cyclists. Field sizes of 50-96 riders mentioned across different editions."
      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Attracts experienced ultra-endurance cyclists from across Europe, but not major series or major pro field depth. Strong regional competition with international participants. Personal challenge format means less emphasis on elite racing."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Entry includes Sea Otter Europe festival access, aid stations, Shimano mechanical support, and exclusive race jerseys. The 20-hour supported challenge with professional infrastructure provides reasonable value for European ultra-distance events. Festival integration adds expo access and post-race services."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Girona offers reasonable European pricing. Budget flights to Barcelona or Girona from European hubs. Accommodation varies but available. No extreme remoteness premium. Total trip cost moderate by European standards - estimated $500-800 including travel from within Europe."
