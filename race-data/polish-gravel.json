          "transcript": "[Music]\nSo this is crackoff in spring. Sunshine,\ntrees in full bloom, and that first warm\nbreeze that seems to lift everyone's\nmood. And like any self-respecting\nEuropean city, Krakov's answer to nice\nweather is simple. Grab a bike and go.\nRental spots fill up quickly, bike lanes\nget busy, and suddenly the whole city is\non the move. and watching it all, I felt\nlike I was missing out on Krakco's full\nspring potential. But luckily, that was\neasy enough to\nchange. So, I decided to rent a bike and\nhave a little adventure around Kov.\nLet's do\nit. So, we are in Kraco, friends, and I\nbelieve it is the most beautiful city in\nPoland. When you are here, there are\nthree mustsee spots you absolutely can't\nmiss. First up, Wavvel Castle. Of\ncourse, you can already see it in the\nbackground, but I suggest we ride closer\nto check it out, and we can also escape\nthe wind along this beautiful Vista\nRiver. So, let's\ngo. All right, there we go. First\nmoments on the bike. First test drive.\nSo far so good. If I make it through\nthis bike day without dropping my\ncamera, I'm calling this video a\nsuccess.\nIt's a walk with a bike. Just wanted to\nshow you the castle from this\nperspective. Safety first. I am afraid\nof riding a bike and filming, especially\nwhen I am on the bridge.\nI was a little bit naive thinking they\nwould Let bikes inside. They do not\nallow dogs, bikes, I don't know what it\nis, guns. So, we will keep moving on\nfoot, kings and queens, battles and\ncoronations.\nWavvel Castle has witnessed centuries of\nPoland's history unfold. This hilt of\nfortress isn't just important. It's the\nvery heart of Kov where royalty once\nwalked and history was made. And while\nyou could easily lose yourself here for\nhours exploring the grand halls and\ntowering cathedral, we're just making a\nquick stop for now. But here is a\nsecret. The real magic happens at\nsunset. That golden hourglow over the\nVistella River turns the whole place\ninto something out of a fairy tale. I've\nbeen dreaming of watching the sunset\nfrom the castle. It was definitely worth\ncoming back later. Just giving you a\nsneak peek, but there is still more of\nKov to see right now. So, let's keep\nmoving.\nSo for you bicycle geeks out there, let\nme tell you something about the\nspecifications what you get for your\nmoney. So I picked up the cheapest bike.\nIt is less than $1 per hour. So I have\nbrakes that apparently work. I have\nseven gears and I have a seat that will\ngive you a serious butt pain if you ride\nmore than a couple of kilometers. When\nthey picked up this bike, a girl was\nreturning hers and a bike guy was like,\n\"So, how was your ride?\" She said, \"My\nbutt aches.\" So now I know what she\nmeant. And while my budget bike might\nnot win any comfort awards, the cool\nthing about Krakov is you don't need to\nride for hours to see the main\nattractions. What makes this city great\nis how perfectly compact it is. The old\ntown and its iconic spots are only a\nshort ride away. Everything is within\neasy reach. So far, Krakco has been\nsurprisingly bike friendly with smooth\nsurfaces under the wheels. Case in\npoint, look where we're already. Next\nstop, zero effort. That's the magic of\nthis\nplace. Spot number two is of course\nKraov's main square. Some people would\nsay it's actually number one, but on our\nlist it's number two today. So there is\nno specific bike lanes here but people\nbike through the square all the time. I\nam trying to do the same. This is my\nvery first time here on the bike.\nThe main square leads you straight into\na maze of narrow streets in the old\ntown, which by the way is a UNESCO World\nHeritage site. I really just wanted to\nenjoy the beauty of these medieval\nstreets. But I'll be honest, figuring\nout the cycling rules here was a bit\nconfusing. Some parts are pedestrian\nonly, others have limited traffic. And\nthen there are oneway streets where\nbikes can actually go both ways. You are\nallowed to cycle in most pedestrian\nareas, including the main square, but\ncars are mostly bent unless you have a\nspecial permit. Anyway, I survived the\nbumpy ride. Just take it slow and keep\nan eye on the signs.\nThe cobblestones of the old town shakes\nyou up a little bit, but once you're out\nthe old town, You naturally roll right\ninto this park.\nKov's city center is absolutely amazing,\nbut also pretty touristy. So, let me\ntake you guys to a hidden gem. A place\nthat far fewer tourists visit. It's a\nsecret lake that you would never guess\nis actually so close to\ndowntown. So, we're saying goodbye to to\nAristi Krakov and we're off to the lake.\nYou got your mama's\nsunshine. You got your daddy's\nrain. You're like a piece of\nheaven in a\nhurricane. And it's bubbling\nover like sweet\nchampagne. You got your mama's\nsunshine. You got your daddy's rain.\nAll day long, right or wrong, you\nquestion\neverything. Why the grass is green? Can\nI stay up late? And why do bluebirds\nsing? Sometimes you cry, your big blue\neyes for no discernable reason. Your\npoint of view, it comes and goes like\nchanging of the seasons. You got your\nmama's\nheaven. in a hurricane.\nAnd we're having a quick stop to\nappreciate this communist era\nmonstrosities. Look at this guys. It is\na bank. Wow. Bank\nPakasa and a bunch of Soviet style\napartment blocks. Oh my goodness. I\ndidn't know that Krakov has so many of\nthem.\nyour guard. You're like a miniature\nPicasso with your markers on the wall.\nYou got your mama\nchampagne. You got your mama.\nAll righty. It took me maybe 15 minutes\nand we made it to Zach Shouk Park. And\nhere is a lake on the map. It was a city\nproject to transform a limestone quarry\ninto a recreational area for Krakov's\nresidence. What a brilliant idea. What\nwas once a neglected pit became a\nbeautiful natural spot with a lake\nsuitable for swimming. So, I hope we\nescaped the crowds, but I'm not\nsure. You know that feeling when you're\njust far enough from the city that\neverything changes? There were still\npeople around, but mostly it was just\ntrees and these crazy limestone cliffs,\nwhich are pretty common in southern\nPoland. Apparently, people actually\ntrain here for real mountains. If you\nhad told me this was still Kov, I'd\nhonestly be confused. The ride in was\nsurprisingly comfortable, and at first\ncruising downhill felt like pure bliss.\nYou can reach the lake from the beach\nside. It's pretty crowded, so clearly\nthis place is no secret. And after\nspending some time by the water, I had a\nthought. I need to get to the top of\nthose cliffs because the view from up\nthere must be\nstunning. All the uphills are killing\nme. I underestimated this area. I gave\nup halfway this steep hill because it is\nit isn't manageable for me to make it\nthere by bike.\nSo I guess this view was worth all the\nefforts. Wow, this quarry is gorgeous.\nThe color of water is\nbeautiful. We made it by bike.\nAll righty, guys. I returned my bike. I\nhad to. They only work until 7. So now\nwhen I'm walking, I feel like I'm very,\nvery slow. It was a pretty active and\nfun day on two wheels. I hope I won't\nsore tomorrow. So, thank you very much\nfor coming along with me. Hopefully I'll\nsee you next time from Ukraine. So until\nnext time, guys. Bye.",
