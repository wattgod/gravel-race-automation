The course delivers a 20-mile climb to 8,800 feet that had Tony Huston \"telling each other that we weren't crying, there was just mountain dust in our eyes.\" Two laps of the 85K course means experiencing every major climb twice, creating sustained suffering over the full distance."
      },
      "technicality": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "The course combines 96% gravel county roads with technical navigation challenges requiring GPS and handlebar-mounted maps. One 160-mile rider got lost multiple times following a malfunctioning Garmin, and limited course markings in remote areas with no cell reception create real navigation risk. Tony Huston described the gravel as \"fine gravel roads, perfect for light tires\" on the technical terrain."
      },
      "elevation": {
        "score": 5,
        "explanation": "12,000 feet of gain over 160K puts this firmly in the hurt-locker category - that's 75 feet per kilometer of pure vertical punishment. Rolling foothills in the Sangre de Cristo range means constant up-and-down rather than one massive climb, which can be more devastating over distance. The elevation profile alone makes this a sufferfest regardless of the race's other shortcomings."
      },
      "climate": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "The 2025 race got postponed from April 19 to May 4 due to \"inclement weather,\" which tells you spring conditions in southern Colorado are unreliable at best. May weather in the mountain foothills can range from perfect to miserable with little warning. Organizers had to move the entire event suggests they're still figuring out optimal timing for this location."
      },
      "altitude": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Trinidad sits around 6,000 feet with the course climbing into higher foothills, putting you in moderate altitude territory that affects sea-level dwellers but isn't devastating. It's enough to notice if you're coming from lower elevations but not high enough to require serious acclimatization. The rolling terrain means you're constantly changing elevation, which can amplify the altitude impact over 160K."
      },
      "adventure": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Riding through historic mining areas including the Ludlow Memorial adds historical context to the suffering. Starting in Cokedale and climbing through Sangre de Cristo foothills with Fisher Peak views delivers mountain adventure. The Pony Express theme isn't just marketing fluff - you're actually traversing historic frontier territory that adds meaning to the miles."
      },
      "prestige": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "A race so invisible that no past winners are mentioned anywhere and results are buried on racetecresults.com tells you everything about its standing. Being the Colorado State Gravel Championship venue sounds impressive until you realize nobody talks about it and the entire 2026 season is \"paused.\" The gravel community has spoken with silence."
      },
      "race_quality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Organizer Phil was described as \"incredibly relieved and happy when the last riders came through, giving bro-hugs at the final aid station,\" suggesting grassroots organization rather than professional race management. The 10 MPH minimum pace requirement for 160K creates real cutoff pressure, but multiple riders getting lost due to limited course markings reveals execution gaps in a remote, challenging environment."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Starting in Cokedale and riding through historic mining areas including the Ludlow Memorial should create memorable moments, but the execution falls short. Fisher Peak views and Sangre de Cristo mountain backdrop provide scenic payoff, but packet pickup ending at 8:30 AM for a 9 AM start is cutting it dangerously close. The bones of a good experience exist but aren't properly developed."
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "A race that bills itself as reigniting \"your passion for cycling\" but generates no passionate testimonials is telling you something. 2026 is paused suggests even the organizers aren't that committed to building something lasting."

      "field_depth": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "No field size data, no notable past winners, no pro participation mentioned despite being a state championship venue. When a race can't even generate enough buzz to produce publicly available results or rider stories, the competitive depth is clearly minimal. The separate pro start times suggest they're trying to create elite racing, but where are the elite racers?"
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Entry fees ranging from $89.95 early bird to $149.95 late registration buy access to spectacular Colorado mountain terrain with three well-stocked aid stations featuring Hammer Nutrition products. However, the intimate 15-rider field and basic finish line amenities (t-shirts only) provide limited race experience for the premium pricing, especially given the navigation risks in remote terrain."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Trinidad offers affordable lodging options including Las Animas County fairgrounds camping at $25 per night with basic amenities. The course is described as \"fine gravel roads, perfect for light tires,\" keeping equipment costs reasonable, and the remote southern Colorado location away from resort areas helps control accommodation expenses for visiting riders."
