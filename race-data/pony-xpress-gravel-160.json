The course delivers a 20-mile climb to 8,800 feet that had Tony Huston \"telling each other that we weren't crying, there was just mountain dust in our eyes.\" Two laps of the 85K course means experiencing every major climb twice, creating sustained suffering over the full distance. Among the longest in gravel, comparable to Badlands."

        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "The course combines 96% gravel county roads with technical navigation challenges requiring GPS and handlebar-mounted maps. One 160-mile rider got lost multiple times following a malfunctioning Garmin, and limited course markings in remote areas with no cell reception create real navigation risk. Tony Huston described the gravel as \"fine gravel roads, perfect for light tires\" on the technical terrain. More technical than most — comparable to Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

        "score": 5,
        "explanation": "12,000 feet of gain over 160K puts this firmly in the hurt-locker category - that's 75 feet per kilometer of pure vertical punishment. Rolling foothills in the Sangre de Cristo range means constant up-and-down rather than one massive climb, which can be more devastating over distance. The elevation profile alone makes this a sufferfest regardless of the race's other shortcomings. Among the hilliest in gravel, comparable to Badlands.

May weather in the mountain foothills can range from perfect to miserable with little warning. Organizers had to move the entire event suggests they're still figuring out optimal timing for this location. More weather exposure than Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

      "altitude": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Trinidad sits around 6,000 feet with the course climbing into higher foothills, putting you in moderate altitude territory that affects sea-level dwellers but isn't devastating. It's enough to notice if you're coming from lower elevations but not high enough to require serious acclimatization. The rolling terrain means you're constantly changing elevation, which can amplify the altitude impact over 160K. Similar altitude considerations to Grinduro."
      },

        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Riding through historic mining areas including the Ludlow Memorial adds historical context to the suffering. Starting in Cokedale and climbing through Sangre de Cristo foothills with Fisher Peak views delivers mountain adventure. The Pony Express theme isn't just marketing fluff - you're actually traversing historic frontier territory that adds meaning to the miles. As Remote Course Conditions puts it: \"Areas of the course are very remote with limited mobile phone reception. It will be very important that all riders monitor there energy levels, weather conditions and navigational tools.\""

The 10 MPH minimum pace requirement for 160K creates real cutoff pressure, but multiple riders getting lost due to limited course markings reveals execution gaps in a remote, challenging environment."

However, the intimate 15-rider field and basic finish line amenities (t-shirts only) provide limited race experience for the premium pricing, especially given the navigation risks in remote terrain."

I made up a lot of time on the descents, got crushed on the climbs (usual story). Incredible scenery, mining ruins, beautiful gravel made for an incredible day. COS Racing had a successful day out, taking the entire men's podium in the 85k and 1st on the women's podium.\n\nRidden on a 2021 Giant Revolt Advanced 0 with Teravail Cannonball 42s.",
