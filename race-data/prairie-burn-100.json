        "explanation": "The 2026 edition promises a 'new and better format' after previous iterations, suggesting the event is rebuilding rather than established. Despite claims of being 'legendary,' the race lacks visible pro participation or widespread gravel community recognition."
      },
      "race_quality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Well-planned aid station placement and GPS files for all routes show organizational competence.

        "score": 2,

      "community": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "The 5K Fun Run estimates 1-100 participants, which tells you everything about field size expectations. When your event resurfaces with a 'better format,' it suggests the old community didn't stick around."

        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Burner Challenge segments offer $50 prizes across male, female, and non-binary categories, creating some competitive structure. However, the associated 5K estimates just 1-100 participants, suggesting small field sizes without serious racing depth."

      "value": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Post-race activities include beer garden, live music, yoga, and farmer's market creating full day experience. Free gravel bike rentals available at Bikes to You for newcomers, showing commitment to growing the sport beyond just race day revenue."

      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Small Iowa college town keeps lodging and dining affordable. Tim Stahl's equipment advice focuses on 'forgiving' gravel bike geometry rather than expensive gear requirements, and free bike rentals lower the barrier to entry for curious riders."
