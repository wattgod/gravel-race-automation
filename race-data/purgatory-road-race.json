          "description": "#stampede200 #ultraendurance #cyclinggear #cyclingrace #texashellweek \n\nI'm racing in the Stampede 200 race in Fredericksburg, TX on April 1st - here's a rundown of the bike, kit, gear, tools, and nutrition I'm taking along! There is no support on the course, but there are two aid stations and one resupply, so I have to be prepared for everything! This is my first ultra endurance race, so I hope I'll have everything I need!\n\nThe Stampede 200 is a 200 mile bike race with a whopping 10,000 feet of climbing! It's my first ever ultra endurance race, the farthest I've ever attempted to cycle, and the most elevation I've ever tackled. It's part of Texas Hell Week, a week-long event in the hill country of central Texas.

          "transcript": "hi folks Eric here for those of you that\nfollow my channel know that I will be\ncompeting in a 200 mile race on April\n1st it is the Stampede 200 in\nFredericksburg Texas and it's part of\nthe Texas hell week event they have\nthere is also a 500 mile race\num definitely not ready to do that so\nright now it's actually the day before\nthe race there's going to be a race\nmeeting tonight and the race takes off\nat 6 a.m tomorrow morning so I just got\ndone doing a little bit of a course\nRecon ride I did about 10 miles of the\ncourse I wanted to see what the road\nsurfaces were like wanted to see what\nthe hills were like did a little bit of\ndriving on it yesterday too and it is\n200 miles like I said just over 200\nmiles just over 10 000 feet of climbing\nis what they say we will see what my\ngarment says at the end of the race but\nI had a chance to get my bike you know\nback to the hotel room that I'm in I'm\nhere in Fredericksburg Texas in a hotel\nand got the bike cleaned up as much as I\ncan on the road got the chain all\ngreased up ready to go and kind of have\neverything laid out for the race just to\nmake sure I'm not going to forget\nanything so I kind of wanted to show you\nhow I've prepared for this race what\nI'll be taking on the bike with me\nwhat's attached to the bike what will be\nin my jersey the race is two 100 mile\nLoops so I will be able to come back and\nresupply in the middle of the race so\nI'm also going to show you kind of what\nI will have in the middle of the race\nthe way this race works is you're not\nallowed to have any support cars out on\nthe course so it's not like I can have a\nfollow car that keeps me resupplied the\nentire time so I will have to take a lot\nof things along with me every 50 miles\nthere is an aid station where I'll be\nable to refill my water but you know 50\nmiles it might be three bottles of water\nso still kind of figuring out when the\nthe pros and cons of taking things with\nme but I want to kind of show you what I\nhave prepared here and also give you a\nwish list of kind of how I wish I had\nprepared and things that I wish I had\nhad for this race of course this being\nmy first 200 mile race and my first race\nit all in seven years I really don't\nknow what all I might need I'm actually\nexcited to see what other Riders bring\nand how they prepare and what bikes\nthey're riding tire sizes what have you\nto prepare for this race but let's go\nthrough and I'm going to show you what I\nhave here so as you can see here this is\na whole pile of stuff know that I'm not\ngoing to take all this on the bike with\nme at once some of this stuff is going\nto be at that aid station for when I\ncome back through a lot of this stuff is\njust in case I used to be a Boy Scout so\nI believe in being prepared so first off\nI'm going to show you what I'm going to\nsort of have attached to the bike and in\nmy pockets for I'm going to call it the\ntech of this so I'm going to have my\niPhone I will have a recharger here for\nthe iPhone I think it's going to be\npretty bad cell phone signal here in\nHill Country of Texas so I do not want\nthat phone to run out of batteries I\nhave a pair of aftershocks headphones\nthat I'm going to wear these are really\nnice because they are bone conduction\nwhich means I can still hear cars coming\nI can still hear things in the\nenvironment that could be a problem\nhere I have a series of headlights and\ntail lights so this race starts and ends\nin the dark so I'm going to have\nheadlights for when it gets dark one to\nstart with one that I'm gonna grab the\nsecond trip through just to make sure I\nhave a fresh battery I have three tail\nlights tail lights I'm going to run the\nentire time I the batteries of one is\ngoing to last a whole hundred miles so I\njust have a third in case there's some\nsort of issue this is the Garmin HRM\ndual heart rate monitor Works in amp\nPlus and Bluetooth that's how I'm going\nto be sending my heart rate data to the\nGarmin 1040 solar\nI picked up this Garmin 1040 solar\nmainly because of battery life I've run\nother bike computers before and over the\ncourse of longer rides had that battery\ndie and this it claims because it can\nrecharge with solar can last 100 hours\non a single charge I actually do have\nthe course saved on this not only is it\nkeeping track of all of my data while\nI'm riding it's also giving me the route\nso this is going to be up on the bike\nhere is the DJI osmo action it is the\nfirst one I have not upgraded that I'm\ngoing to have that on the handlebars of\nthe bike a 256 gig memory card\nand I am going to take two extra\nbatteries with me and one in the camera\nso I'll resupply batteries with each\nloop I am going to shoot some video\nwhile I'm on this ride but it's going to\nbe secondary to the riding I'm not going\nto be fiddling around with the camera a\nwhole lot I'm going to shoot a little\nbit of video with the iPhone shoot a\nlittle bit of video with the camera and\nmy wife's gonna have a couple cameras\nwhen I start and and loop through in the\nmiddle this little box right here is a\nlittle pill box it's holding a few\nthings just to have in case of an\nemergency here I have salt tablets I'm\ngoing to try to take a salt tablet every\nhour at least to replace those\nelectrolytes these are just some aspirin\nacetaminophen I have some Sudafed I have\nsome anti-diarrheal pills just in case\nimportant to have those on a long ride\nand just some more salt tablets here I\nhave an extra memory card for the osmo\nand actually in this case is where I'm\ngoing to hold\nthese two extra batteries this fits\nreally nice together and can fit in a\nback pocket really easily so that'll be\nin my back pocket now let's go over to\nwhat's going to be in my saddle bag so\nI really tried to pair this down I have\na really abbreviated version of this for\nwhen I go on a group ride and there are\nother Riders there that may be able to\nhelp me and I can help them but with\nthis I had to get a little bit bigger of\na saddle bag than I'm used to riding on\nthis bike and I just want to make sure\nI'm prepared so I have a couple extra\ntubes have some Tire levers I have a\nreal tiny multi-tool this is made by\nBontrager I think I got it at a Trek\nStore once uh it has everything I know\nhow to use I do not know how to fix a\nchain so if my chain breaks there's\neither a sag vehicle or I'm in trouble\nso let's let's hope my chain doesn't\nbreak\nhere I have some CO2 cartridges and a\nnozzle to\nrefill the tires with air in case of a\nflat I have a couple patches and some\npatch glue there so all that's going to\nbe inside that saddle bag also I neglect\nto say I do have some aquifer here you\nknow for chapped lips and in the real\ncase of emergency a kiss I started\ngetting some saddle sores so all of that\nis going to be in the saddle bag\nunder the saddle of the bike\nnow this is sort of backup maintenance\nstuff now if I on the first Loop through\nI get a flat tire I get two flat tires I\nhave some tubes to replace things with I\nhave some more CO2 cartridges I have\nsome Degreaser and some bike cleaner\nkind of some something you don't need\nwater for in case the bike's super dirty\nand I can get it a little clean real\nquick if I need to do that the chain\ngets to be garbage I can decrease it\nreal quick and I also have a roller for\nmy cabs and my quads when I come back\nthrough I have some PR lotion which is\npretty good for making your calves and\nquads feel good too\nand I have another battery charger in\ncase I use it the first time through now\nwhat I don't have just because I was\njust using it we\nre-oiling my chain as I do have some\nchain lube and another rag that I'm\ngoing to have in that saddle bag\nso let's talk about nutrition hydration\nEtc\nso\nI have become very accustomed to using\ngels as my nutrition and eating as I'm\nwriting so here I have a whole bunch of\ndifferent goo gels Cliff gels some of\nthese have caffeine in them some of\nthese have\nelectrolytes in them so I'm going to\nhave a whole bunch of gels on me I have\nsome of these to drop in the water to\nadd some electrolytes I have some sis\ngels as well I like these because\nthey're very easy to eat but they're\njust a little bit bigger so for that\nreason I tend to lean towards the the\ngoose I also have a lot of these Cliff\nblocks\nagain they are a little bigger they're\nlike gummies but you know when you're\nout on a very long ride these just taste\nreally good it's like having candy so I\ngotta have something that makes me feel\ngood while I'm riding now in my bottles\nI'm going to have this\nBCAA powder\num I like the way this helps fuel me\nduring a ride I'm going to start out\nwith it in the bottles and then when I\nrefill it I won't have it I also do have\na couple of these hydration packs that I\nmay mix in we're just going to see how\nmuch I can stuff in my pockets\nI have four water bottles\ntwo on the bike and I may put one in a\nback pocket I haven't really decided\nexactly how many water bottles I'm going\nto carry but I'm also going to have some\nthat when I loop back through my wife\nwill have a couple for me full of water\nwith BCAAs in it so that'll kind of some\nof those will be for resupply now as far\nas kit is concerned\nI am going to start out\nwith this kit here I have a pair of\nspecialized shoes I really like these\nshoes I like this this boa system of\ntightening these shoes I prefer these\nbecause these have two I can really\nsort of customize the way these feel on\nmy feet and even as a ride goes\nsometimes you want things to be looser\ntighter in certain parts that's a very\ngood very adjustable bibs\nI have these from the black bibs and\nthese are actually the endurance the\nupgraded ones I liked my other black\nbibs so much that I paid for the\nendurance ones\nthis uh I always wear a little skull cap\nunder my helmet\nI have a bald head so I don't like the\nway a helmet chafes my head and I also\ndon't want really weird helmet tan lines\non my bald head so just a little head\nsweats skull cap this jersey sorry about\nit being all wrinkled up because it was\nstuffed in my luggage all week this is\nanother Jersey from black bibs it's sort\nof the the summer performance Jersey\nso like I said I'm going to be starting\nout wearing this now\nif I'm on that first Loop and it rains\nand I get drenched I have a backup kit\nto change into\nI may want to change into this backup\nkit anyway if I get super sweaty I don't\nwant to get chafed up in parts that are\nreally going to annoy me so I do have a\nbackup kit this is just the standard\nblack bibs also a standard black bibs\nJersey since I may be riding more at\nnight at the end I may switch into\nSupply visibility and I have a backup\npair of shoes just in case I get\ndrenched these are just regular Shimano\nshoes these are typically what I wear\nwhen I ride indoors on the trainer but\nGotta Have backups\nand here it sort of backups to my\nbackups I have a you know another Jersey\nI don't know why\nnow this I may make a judgment call and\ngo for shorts over bibs on the second\nhalf the only negative about bibs is\nthey are hard to use the restroom in so\nif that starts bugging me on the first\nlap through I may change into shorts for\nthe second also I have some various\ngloves\narm warmers a rain kit a little kind of\na windbreaker shirt that depending on\nhow the weather starts out I may or may\nnot wear those\ngot some socks back up pairs of socks I\ngot a pair of heavier socks and this is\nmy old helmet and by laser and even my\nbuddy Troy says you got to get a new\nhelmet so if you have suggestions on a\nnew helmet I would love to hear them now\nthe bike\nthis is my specialized tarmac sl6 it's\nthe lowest model specialized tarmac but\nit is a it's a great bang for buck\neverything is pretty standard on it\nexcept for you know the things that I've\nadded to it it's I'm riding the standard\nwheels these are even the tires they\ncome with these are 26 millimeter tires\nI've added a little bag up here that I'm\ngoing to stuff as many gels as humanly\npossible in\nI've got a mount up here for my Garmin\nand for\nmy DJI osmo have a couple really\nlightweight bottle cages but other than\nthat\ngoing standard on the specialized now\na few things that\nprobably would be more helpful is if I\nwere to have Arrow bars\nalso if I were to have upgraded Wheels\nAero bars would let me be it would let\nme get more Arrow would let me break the\nwind better\nmaybe even give me another position to\nkind of lean down for a while but I\nhaven't trained on Arrow bars and I'm\nnot going to change anything now as far\nas wheels are concerned at the moment\nthese are the best I can afford I may\neventually try to get some lighter\nweight Carbon wheels don't know if I\nwant to go deep section because of\nCrosswinds now one thing that even on my\ncourse Recon\none thing that's definitely on my wish\nlist is I wish I had slightly larger\ntires for this ride a lot of these roads\nare tar and Chip or chip and seal\nwhatever you want to call it and they\ncan get a little rough\num not even approaching gravel but\nsomething that definitely these 26\nmillimeter tires are going to make me\nfeel every bump of so you know that I\nguess that's probably the first thing on\nmy wish list is if I had slightly larger\ntires\num no power meter\nstill\nhaven't trained with a power meter other\nthan what is on my bike in zwift but a\npower meter in the future is definitely\nsomething that would help me be able to\nPace myself more accurately and get a\nreal-time sort of reading of what I'm\nputting out so I'm going to go ahead and\nload this bike up I'll probably switch\nto like a wide angle shot run it in fast\nmotion let me see everything I can get\nfit on this bike\none thing that I did neglect to mention\nwhile making this video is I am going to\ninclude some real food in what I'm\neating I have some Clif bars some\nLarabars bananas some orange juice\nsome Gatorade also I'll be eating some\novernight oats the morning before the\nrace having a little coffee so it's not\nlike I'm just gonna survive just on uh\ncliff and gel bars and if you're\nwatching right now I did manage to fit\n10 of those little goo packets inside\nthat top bag so that profile design bag\nI don't know what else you could fit in\naside from that but I definitely suggest\nthat bag for those little goo gels\nwell that's the setup that's what I'm\ntaking with me on my first 200 mile race\nkeep in mind there's another 14 hours\nbefore I leave this hotel room and go to\nwhere the race starts so that's a lot of\ntime for me to second guess myself and\nstart adding and taking things away uh\nI think I have everything and when I go\nthrough and watch this video a second\ntime through\nI'm gonna reassess and make sure I have\nit all then but this is what I'm taking\nwith me hopefully it goes well\num\nI'll check back in afterwards and let\nyou know how I did expect it to take a\nlittle while to edit that video together\nI hope you enjoyed this and if you're\ngonna do your first 200 mile race take\nthis with a grain of salt this is just\nme showing for my first time through\nwhat I'm taking along if you guys have\nany suggestions or comments this is what\nI should have taken instead or maybe\nthat was something I hadn't thought of\nbe sure you drop that in the comments\nlove it if you liked this video And\nsubscribe to the channel if you haven't\nalready and thanks again for watching\nI'm Eric we'll see you later",

It’s always there.\nhttps://www.offroadsigns.store/  Trees Ranch Offroad Park – Fredericksburg Texas. Are you actually ready?\nNotice who rolls onto Texas Hill Country limestone and checks traction before committing to a climb. Watch what happens when throttle stays measured over loose caliche instead of surging and breaking grip. As you picture easing across an off-camber rock slab, you can feel how abrupt braking shifts weight downhill and forces correction. Terrain like this is where riders quietly decide things. And what it reveals doesn’t always stay at the park.\nAverage riders react to the ledge in front of them. Controlled riders read approach angle, surface texture, and exit line before entry. One experiences the obstacle. The other carries what it proved.\nNow here’s what separates them. Limestone climbs demand steady momentum, not bursts. Embedded rock gardens require precise tire placement. Tight cedar-lined trails test visibility and steering discipline. Loose gravel descents punish late braking. Fatigue builds when inputs become reactive instead of deliberate.\nAnd this is where it shifts. The difference shows up when traction changes mid-climb, when a hidden ledge appears, when gravity pulls harder than pride.\nSome riders leave it behind. Others don’t.\nTrails expose truth. Real riders keep the proof.\n\nRemember...

        "search_text": "The Purgatory Road Race in Fredericksburg, Texas features challenging Texas Hill Country terrain with limestone surfaces that demand steady momentum rather than power surges. The course includes loose gravel descents that punish late braking and embedded rock gardens requiring precise tire placement. Riders describe traction that can shift unexpectedly mid-climb. Race logistics include aid stations every 50 miles where water refills are available, but no support vehicles are allowed on course, making self-sufficiency critical. The race format uses two 100-mile loops allowing midpoint resupply. Starting and finishing in darkness requires proper lighting equipment. Cell phone signal is poor throughout the Hill Country area. Riders report significant elevation gain with just over 10,000 feet of climbing across the full distance. The limestone climbs and technical rock sections test bike handling skills and pacing strategy."
