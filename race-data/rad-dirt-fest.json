        "explanation": "Life Time owns this race, which means corporate polish but zero grassroots soul. Keegan Swenson showed up once in 2024 and won by 83 seconds over Stetina, but it's still fighting for relevance against UNBOUND. The Grand Prix inclusion gives it credibility, but getting dropped from 2025 then added back for 2026 screams second-tier status."
      },
      "race_quality": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "90% maintained gravel roads that riders call 'champagne gravel' and 'buttery smooth' - this isn't your typical Colorado washboard nightmare. Aid stations every 20-30 miles with proper cutoff times, though that 31-mile no-service stretch will expose the unprepared. Life Time's event machine delivers professional execution, even if it lacks character."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Spanish Peaks backdrop at 9,000 feet with views that make the suffering worthwhile - 'every grueling climb rewarded with mesmerizing views' as one rider put it. The transition from high desert to aspen forests delivers Colorado beauty without the Leadville death march. Trinidad's old west character adds authenticity that most corporate events lack."
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Gravel community shows up hard here - riders consistently praise it as 'incredible and accepting' with particular support for women racers described as 'absolute beasts.' 1,000+ cyclists from 40 states and 11 countries proves drawing power. The welcoming atmosphere builds confidence rather than crushes souls, which is rarer than you'd think."
      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Swenson, Stetina, Vermeulen, and De Crescenzo's three straight wins show decent elite participation, but it's not UNBOUND depth. Life Time's Grand Prix connection brings quality riders, but the field thins quickly after the top 10. It's a stepping stone race for many, not a destination event for the deepest talent. Similar competitive depth to Rule of Three."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "50 UNBOUND qualifier coins split between 70 and 110-mile distances gives you two shots at the golden ticket. Three distance options mean you're not locked into one suffer-fest, and that 'buttery smooth' gravel delivers performance without destroying equipment. Life Time's production value exceeds most regional events at comparable pricing."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Registration runs $150-$200. Trinidad isn't Aspen pricing, but it's not free either - you'll need lodging since this isn't a day trip for most. Life Time registration fees match their corporate overhead, and getting to southern Colorado requires commitment. The Spanish Peaks Inn crew access point suggests decent accommodation options, but budget accordingly. Similar expense level to Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "62 miles hits the sweet spot between 'why bother' and 'please make it stop' - it's the Anteloop distance that bridges desert terrain with snowcapped mountain views. Not long enough to be epic, not short enough to be easy. Perfect for building confidence before attempting the 110-mile Stubborn Delores masochism. Similar distance to Crusher in the Tushar. As Lauren De Crescenzo puts it: \"I tried to go a few times on the steep pitches of the first climb and was finally able to break free on a steep, sandy portion somewhere between miles 25 and 30.\""

        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "That 2-mile South Shore Trail technical section and Burro Canyon's 9-mile climb will test handling skills despite the 'champagne gravel' reputation. 90% maintained roads mean consistent surfaces, but elevation changes and two-track sections demand real bike handling. Not Leadville technical, but far from a rail-trail cruise. More technical than most — comparable to Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego. As Lauren De Crescenzo puts it: \"I tried to go a few times on the steep pitches of the first climb and was finally able to break free on a steep, sandy portion somewhere between miles 25 and 30.\""
      },
      "elevation": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "8,202 feet of climbing from 6,025 feet starting elevation to nearly 9,000 at the top - this isn't flat Colorado plains riding. The gradual nature means sustainable power over grinding climbs, but that altitude will find your weak spots. Views of Fisher's Peak and Spanish Peaks justify the leg-burning ascents. More climbing than SBT GRVL at the same score. As Lauren De Crescenzo puts it: \"I tried to go a few times on the steep pitches of the first climb and was finally able to break free on a steep, sandy portion somewhere between miles 25 and 30.\""

      "climate": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Late September offers 73-80°F highs with 51°F lows, but that high desert environment creates hydration challenges - expect 'chapped lips, dry throat, empty bottles.' 72% sunshine sounds nice until you're exposed for hours. Wind averages 14.7 mph, which becomes a factor on those open mesas. Similar climate challenges to SBT GRVL. As Hannah puts it: \"Even though the weather was looking questionable, I was able to finish my first 100 mile ride and beat the rain. Trinidad gravel lived up to all the hype and my legs felt strong throughout the ride.\""
      },
      "altitude": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Starting at 6,025 feet and climbing to 9,000 feet means sea-level riders will feel it immediately. That thin air compounds the 8,200+ feet of elevation gain into suffering. Trinidad's elevation isn't Leadville brutal, but it's enough to separate the adapted from the foolish. Higher altitude racing, comparable to SBT GRVL."
      },
      "logistics": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Life Time's corporate machine delivers professional organization, but that 31-mile stretch with no cell service between aid stations creates anxiety for many riders. Three crew access points help, but Trinidad's remote location means limited backup options. Spanish Peaks Inn checkpoint at mile 42.8 provides key support, assuming you make the 1:20 PM cutoff."
      },
      "adventure": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "4,775 square miles of Las Animas County gravel roads deliver exploration through Colorado's largest county. Old railroad ruins, dilapidated mining history, and transition from high desert to alpine forests create real discovery. That no-service 31-mile section forces self-reliance that most corporate events avoid."

The gravel is buttery smooth, but 8,900 feet doesn't negotiate with your sea-level fitness. Show up undertrained and that remote backcountry section becomes a very expensive therapy session.",

dirtfest here in Trinidad\nColorado we launched the rad in 2021 was\nour first year after a discovery phase\nin 2020 during covid when the big gravel\nboom was happening but there weren't\nevents taking place at that time and we\nwere looking for the next community that\nwe could invest in and make a difference\nwith together the rad belongs a trended\nad and the community stakeholders\nleadership and local businesses become\nour partners they show up to volunteer\nfor us and without their partnership\ntheir event can't take\nplace it's been a great economic boom\nand it's just another attribute that\ndefines Trinidad as a diverse Community\npar God\nCommunity uh bicycles bike life bring\neverybody together\nyou know a lot to like about it Trinidad\nis the perfect place to come to enjoy\nyourself bring your family B Brien is\nthe ultimate\nher we look for communities that would\notherwise be undiscovered and I think\nthat have a commitment to growth and we\nfound that here with Trinidad yeah we've\narrived at the rad um second last stop\nin the Grand Prix Trinidad gravel is is\nawesome I've still got good confidence\nfor the weekend and the race suits me\nand I'm hanging on to faith at these\nlast two I'm going to climb the leader\nboard\nthis is going to be an awesome day of\nbike racing gravel racing here in\nTrinidad Colorado beautiful Spanish\nPeaks Grand M say these Racers are out\nfor a spectacular race in Southern\nColorado I couldn't agree more the rad\ndirt Fest is now the fifth stop in the\nlifetime Grand Prix and is looking to be\nhot from the\nstart before we get a look at the action\nlet's take a look at the lifetime Grand\nPrix leaderboard brought to you by SB\nafter their race in schaman the top\nthree men are Keegan and llin in first\nand second Cole and paac and tied for\nthird with 7066 and 62 points\nrespectively and behind them is Matt\nbeers and Alex wild to round out our top\nfive on the men's side on the women's\nside Sophia is holding on to first place\nwith 70 points behind her with 66 points\npaig onweller and with 62 points Haley\nSmith Melissa Rollins and Alexis scard\nour tide for fourth with 60\npoints and now we are only moments away\nfrom the next stop in the lifetime Grand\nPrix presented by Mazda we'll see I mean\nwe'll see very soon as we head out of\nthis steep start and I think it's going\nto be aggressive to the gun but I'll\nfind out very soon how do I get a\nsneaking feeling you guys are going to\nbe hanging out together today cuz we're\nbuddies we're Pals that's what even if\nyou're dying a thousand deaths out there\nyou just look over have some nice\nMountain views try to tone it down bit I\nthink people are hungry for points the\ntop 10 of the lifetime Grand Prix is\nreally close even the podiums up for\ngrabs\ngo and here we go the elite men are off\nand rolling with 110 mil of gravel\nbetween them and the finish line of the\nRat dirt fast taking a big old Punchy\nclimb here this thing's about 20 plus\nper this will set them up with some\nreally good visibility the group is\ntight there is a lot of energy in this\nthey are rolling into this chicane at a\nlittle bit around 20 M an hour and this\nis where it starts to really pay your\ndividends for pre- riding that\ncourse we're hearing some Riders may\nhave made contact as they are crossing\nthe damn\nroad a couple other Pros that tangled up\nwe got seven riders that were entrapped\nin this but nothing major just a touch\nto the bars we are roughly 6 miles in\nwhere the men will now go through\nTrinidad State Park and we will pick\nthem back up on the other side for now\nlet's take it back to the start line\nwhere our Elite women are waiting to\nstart their Journey towards the Spanish\nPeaks that surround Trinidad this is\ngoing to be an awesome day of bike\nracing gravel racing here in Trinidad\nColorado beautiful Spanish Peaks Grand\nMesa these Racers are out for a\nspectacular race in Southern Colorado\n6 5 4 3 2 1\ngo good morning from Trinidad Colorado\nwhere we are off and running with 113\nmiles of the stubborn Dolores course\ntoday over 10,000 FT elevation gain it's\ngoing to be a heated race out there\ntoday it will be a heated race indeed\nour Elite women are making their way\nthrough The Punchy downtown climb\nalready within the first miles leaving\ntown anah Hicks on the front pushing a\nfast pace already stringing out the\nfield here the elite women have now hit\nthe first section of gravel quickly\nmaking their way towards Trinidad State\nPark first selection is going to be the\ndouble track near Trinidad Lake we're a\ncouple of miles into the race right now\nonto the gravel cesy Decker's already\nbeen really kind of pushing the pace on\nthese descents a little bit\nas the women make their way through the\nstate park let's send it over to\nMichelle Duffy to take a look at what\nchallenges these Riders can expect from\nthe course today we start in downtown\nTrinidad Colorado and roll out onto\ngravel where the Riders then connect\nwith a trail on Trinidad Lake State Park\nthis is what we call a roller coaster\nit's a series of Hills across 6\nmiles and typically we expect to see the\npack kind of stay maintained there\nbefore they cross over the highway and\nbegin an 18m long climb up to 9,000 ft\nreaching grades of up to 18% at\ntimes the Riders then descend and then\nclimb up to the highest point at mile 65\nthen the course has a screaming descent\ndownhill for many miles and winds its\nway back to Trinidad Lake State Park\nwhere we expect to see some moves being\nmade but this is the area that's most\nsusceptible to flatting it is it's the\nchunkiest part of the course Riders then\nconnect back on to gravel SE ction that\nbrings them into town where they have a\nseries of very steep pavement Rolling\nHills into a screaming descent to the\nFinish\n[Music]\nLine we're catching back up with the\nmen's group coming out of Trinidad State\nPark with some of the faster Riders\nmoving to the front as we move into the\nnext section of the course Keegan\nSwinson just doing what he does best The\nMarked Man it's a pretty good course for\nme it's at altitude which is good you I\nalways like to ride ride I ride well at\naltitude and you know I'm from altitude\nand I'm just very familiar with it you\nknow there's a few other guys that are\nquite familiar with it and can ride well\nand you can know who to\nwatch the group got up to about 19\nRiders now 16 miles in some sort of a\ngroup going on up front now and Keegan\nis not in that group at the moment Alex\nis very smart tactically so that's\nthat's fun in the races like the rad\nwhere it's not just a fitness contest\nit's a it's a bit of a chess match this\nElite group of 20 Riders Pro men are now\nback together Keegan is just calm and\ncollected he knows what's in store he\nreally didn't burn any matches to try\nand close that down so we are starting\nour\nclimb trying to get a view of house Alex\nhouse who got off the front on this\nclimb the lead group cannot see him how\nis is a threat up here he's you know\nrelatively good at altitude and he's a\nreally experienced racer personally I\nlike to kind of poke the bear a little\nbit do it to them before they do it to\nyou you know we get to the rat and it's\nlike well you know okay let's play some\ngames right\nhere so as the men prepare to clear the\nAid Station let's check the leaderboard\nbrought to you by\nsbl as these Riders prepare to head to\nthe top of the Spanish Peaks Alex house\nis out in front with Kellen Peter and\nKeegan leading the\nchase let's check back in with the women\nas they are coming out of the state park\nand turning North onto Highway 12 so we\ngo across the pavement and we're\nstarting the gradual climb on the stick\nof the lollipop and nobody wanted to go\nto the front The Real L sitting up like\nstupid slow um and then a few people\nstarted to test the group see if anyone\nwould go Lauren went off the front\nlaa cenzo is the instigator of this pace\nand kind of closed it down and she did\nit a few times there are splits in the\ngroup people are trying to hold Wheels\nit is Dusty loose gravel roads right now\neveryone is still connected but again\nthose minor gaps and separations add up\nover the day our Elite women are now\napproaching the top of the big climb\naround mile 60 you just kind of feel it\nin your soul you know you're like this\nthis is the\ntime the moment of\nurgency all right Lauren dienzo has a\nbit of a gap off the front of this group\nAnna hick is up there Melissa Rollins up\nthere kind of trying to set Pace back to\nher she just keeps it going man it's so\nhard to stick with it and so none of us\ncould hang and she just gapped\nus as we started climbing more the pace\ngot gradually harder and people started\nto fall off the group started to dwindle\nLauren de crescenzo is pushing hard and\nlast we heard she had about a 1 and A2\nminute gap on the rest of the field we\nare only 40 mil into this race will she\nbe able to hang on to that Gap going up\nthe longest climb of the\n[Applause]\nday I feel the race really begins in the\nsecond half in those big\nclimbs so as the women make it through\nthe mile 43 aid station let's take a\nlook at the leaderboard brought to you\nby sbl we still have Lauren de crescenzo\npushing the pace out front with a group\nof 10 behind her this group includes\nSophia Melissa Rollins Sarah Sturm and\nPaige onweller just to name a few we're\npicking it back up with the men after\nthe big climb and Alex's Gap has been\nclosed Keegan has now kind of commanded\nthe group here and brought in Griffin\nwith him and you can also see Pete STNA\nsitting right there with Griffin Brenda\nJohnson hydration pack ready to\ngo Alex house had some sort of a\nmechanical uh looking down at the\ndrivetrain and check it out the\ndefending Champion Alexi bermon has\nbridged up enough to be able to see the\nleading eight in front on this climb but\nhe's just pulling over right now so\nlet's see what Alexi has going on front\ntire oh my God the worst timing ever for\nAlexi back up with the lead group here\nit looks like STNA just finished with\nhis pole putting it back on Keegan\nKeegan Not Afraid today to do his fair\nshare Griffin Easter just sitting pretty\nall day long with the power absolutely\nmatching every move that needs to be\nmade oh what a bummer to see Finn here's\nFinn also dropping off the pace it looks\nlike our Elite men are approaching the\ntop of the climb around M\n60 Brendan Johnson seems to be uh the\none that's uh Pace setting this second\nChase group out on the course it's a\nfunny racing that we get to the top and\nthen we Plum it back down and that's two\nhalves of the race um and I like that\nSlow Burn from the start to the top of\nthe hill it creates different Dynamics\nin the group and there's lulls and yeah\nit really starts to set in as you get\ntowards the top and then I think the\ngroup that goes over the top is the one\nthat goes to the Finish\nPeter STNA out front and he's on the\ncanyon with also Griffin Easter on a\ncanyon maybe even perhaps some sort of a\nteammate alliance with Canyon here it's\nsuch a high point after a lot of\nclimbing I think if you're not in the\nfront you need to be with a very\nmotivated group and close it's kind of\njust 1% downhill where that's that's\nlike your Matt beers types can just roll\na big gear and if you're in the front\nyou have to be motivated and have a lot\ncohesion to work together to maintain\nwhat you've\ncreated let's take a look at Matthew\nBeer's data from his Gman devices as we\nwatch him pushing it on the tarmac it's\nimpressive how he's able to hold such a\nhigh average\npower if I'm in a group and it is suited\nto my you know 1% just letting it eat I\nam the guy that everyone looks at I take\npride in that but also not burn my\nmatches as the men continue their\ndescent back into town let's take a look\nat the leaderboard presented by\nsbl at the 81 mile Mark Peter is holding\non in front with Griffin and Keegan\nclose\nbehind and Matthew beers and Brendan\nJohnston round out the top\nfive as we catch back up with the women\nafter the biggest climb of the day let's\nhear what Lauren Hall is seeing out on\ncourse all right just getting a good\nlook at Lauren right now with a\nsignificant Gap she's got over a 3 and 1\nhalf minute lead right now on Chase\ngroup looking really good you know like\nthis lady knows how to suffer like\nnobody else I like riding so\nwell it's one of my favorite things to\ndo just H go for a Lauren ride for four\nto five hours that's what I do all the\ntime this is the chase group they are 4\nand a half minutes down on laurenda\ncenzo sopia is driving the pace of this\ngroup and she's dropping CES Decker and\nMelissa Rollins right now this is a bit\nof a stair step climb before they go\nback towards the lake as this group\nattempts to cover the Gap to Lauren de\ncrescenzo let's take a quick look at\nAlexis scara's Garmin data to see what\nit takes to get over these Punchy\nclimbs will these three be able to keep\npushing the pace and Bridge up to Lauren\nthis has been a race of attrition all\nday for the entire field I have nothing\nto lose I'm not going for the overall in\nthe Grand Prix anymore I'm just going\nfor individual wins I mean I got a\nbackup plan I could always go back to\nwork so nothing to lose any day I just\nwant to go out there and have a good\ntime Sarah is pushing forward dropping\nSES sopia meanwhile is up ahead sitting\non Alexa's wheel and constantly looking\nback we were able to make a gap on Sarah\non the\ndesense let's see if CES can continue\nher push forward towards Sophia and\nAlexis you always wonder like if I was a\nbetter descender was able to be with the\nchase group behind Lauren I guess would\nI be able to have duked it out at the\nend here comes Alexa Sophia and who made\nit back cesy Decker made it back holy\ncow great riding by\nthem Lauren dienzo getting a sense for\nhow she's doing up here solo been solo\nfor most of the day about mile 30 she\nbasically rode off the front of the\ngroup it's definitely wearing on her but\nthis is nothing new for laurena cenzo we\nare back on pavement with our Chase\ngroup of three but it looks like the day\nmay be done for cesal Decker the top\nfour women have now crossed the timing\nmat around mile 81 let's take a look at\nhow the rest of the race is shaking up\nwith our leaderboard brought to you by\nSLI we still have LDC with over a\n4-minute gap Sophia and Alexis are\nchasing and starting to drop C Decker\nand Sarah Lang behind them the race is\nstarting to spread out let's head back\nover to the men to find out how this\nrace is going to shake out Keegan Peter\nand Griffin have broken away from the\npack as they continue this descent into\ndowntown Trinidad it is truly a\nspectacular performance with this lead\ngroup they are putting in so much effort\nand making it look easy today separating\nthemselves from the remainder of the 60\nplus professionals that started the rad\ntoday hey beat's a good bike racer you\nknow uh especially at a race like this\nlike a lot of climbing altitude and you\nCoast a little bit off the top of the\nDescent but then it's like 1 to 2%\ndownhill so you're just like in a big\ngear going fast trying to stay small and\narrow and you know it's a nice Draft\nwhen you're in the wheel but when you're\nin the wind it's you to push quite hard\nto like keep the pace high it was\nGriffin Keegan and myself and I was\nlicking my lips a little bit just\nbecause this was the best case scenario\nfor me and Griff two Canyon sponsored\nriders with Keegan we finally have the\nnumber advantage and we needed to\nmanipulate that the idea is one goes and\nteammate in the moment if you will\nliterally plays poker and says like n\nKeegan you can you can do it I'm going\nto sit on and then if Keegan does commit\nand bring him back the next one goes and\nideally you do that a couple times and\neventually Keegan's just chasing the\nwhole time and he\nbreaks Griff was hurt and he tried\nfirst made Keegan accelerate once I kind\nof dropped off the back for that Hill\ntook a run at\nhim I knew they were going to start\nplaying some games at the bottom of that\nclimb and I saw him chatting I was like\nI bet Griffin will launch first and\ncover that then you know Pete went and\nthen cover Pete to his credit he knew\nwhat was happening tried man like you\nhave to try so proud of that race I knew\nme the course you do me well and uh you\nknow just came in to try and handle\nbusiness and get it done so there you\nhave it Keegan holds off the late push\nto take the top spot with Peter coming\nin second and Griffin holding on to\nthird Matthew beers came in fourth and\nBrendan Johnson rounded out the top\nfive oh man I was a little better but\nthis race is hard and if you don't make\nit over the over the top in the front\nthen yeah it's hard to get back here's\nthe leaderboard brought to you by sbl\nfor the rest of the men's field Finn\ngullixson comes in sixth Kellen Caldwell\nin seventh Julian gang in eighth Henry\nNelson in nth and Russell finsterwald\nrounds out the top 10 Alex wild landed\nin 11th Kyle Trudeau in 12th and early\nleader Alex how ended up in\n14th and now we head back over to the\nwomen last we heard LDC was out to a\nsubstantial lead let's check back in as\nthese athletes have their sights set on\nthe Finish Line all right you guys we\nare here at the Trinidad Lake trying to\nget a bead on Lauren de cenzo coming in\nwe're just checking out our Garmin right\nhere just to get a sense of how soon\nshe's going to be to us but it's\nessentially Lauren should have this\nwrapped up coming into the finish a\nsignificant Gap coming back into\nTrinidad and now we see Sophia and\nAlexis scarta have exited the state park\nwithout cesal in sight it seems they\nreally pushed the pace through that\nsection and have opened up their Gap\neven more but the question remains do\nthey have enough in the tank to catch\nLauren de crescenzo before the finish of\nthe Rat dirt\nFest to save something in the tank for\nthis 30 to 45 second clown right here at\nthe end of 1133 mile\nday oh man just the telling signs on\ntheir legs on their face their body\nthere's just salt all over their\nkit the end is really tough because it's\neasy to settle right it's easy to be\nlike it's not worth it I'm just going to\ntake it back a notch because I'm hurting\nso much and and like when you've been\nRacing for 6 hours I think it's easier\nto kind of think that way oh but wait\nthere's\nmore oh man people are walking their\nbikes up here it's\nbrutal oh my gosh come on you guys\nyou're really going to put this right\nback at the finish of this race holy cow\nLauren is now making her way around the\nfinal turns and pushing towards the\nFinish Line she is almost back to the\nred brick roads of downtown Trinidad and\nlooks to still have over four minutes on\nSophia and\nAlexis what a phenomenal day for Lauren\nto\nwining every time she races here at the\nrad let's welcome Lauren the\ncenzo a rough few last races but this\njust uh this just feels really\ngood Sophia has really good punch at the\nend of races I think she's able to\nattack when everyone's feeling tired and\nshe knows when people are tired and she\nattacks at the right moment CES is\ncoming hard right here there she goes\nright now up the climb trying to make it\nback and there is CES Decker passing\nAlexis scarta putting herself into third\nposition she has been fighting all day\nlong and it is coming down to the wire\nand it looks like Sophia will just be\nable to hold off cesal for a second\nplace finish cesal comes across the line\nin third with Alexis scarta finishing\nforth good\njob it has been an amazing day of racing\nfor what is the fifth stop of the\nlifetime Grand Prix presented by\nMazda here is today's leaderboard for\nthe rest of the field brought to you by\nsbl\nMelissa Rollins hangs on for fifth with\nSarah Lang taking sixth P John Weller in\nseventh Aaron Huck Anna Hicks and Sarah\nSturm will round out our top 10\nrespectively Whitney Allison takes 11th\nHaley Smith and 12th followed by Cecile\nEmily and\nCaroline now let's go to the Finish Line\nwhere the Riders have gathered to\ncelebrate a great day of\nracing what collar bone who needs the\ncollar\nbone it's almost\nsealed I was like dude the only way we\ncan do something in Canyon they'd be\npissed if we didn't like we got to one\nto them you know honestly I'm just super\nhappy on the day um I think I locked up\nthe Grand Prix\noverall I'm in pain I'm tired I want to\nsleep disappointed but also like proud\nof myself for doing it and being out\nhere and being close\nPete has said well it's got a bit of a\nroad racing VI but it's also hard in the\nend I think you know the strongest guys\nwill always kind of rise to the top I\njust it just felt right at the time I\nwas like you know what now I think\nthat's what's so like addictive about\nthis as you walk away from a race and\nyou're like these are the things I did\nwell and these are the things that I can\nimprove and you just kind of Come Away\nwith this list and I think it lights a\nlittle bit of a fire and with another\nrace down here's your sbl leaderboard\nwith the updated standings for the\nlifetime Grand Prix on the men's side\nKeegan swensson still holds on to first\nplace with 105 points Pac and mckelvin\nstill in second with 91 and

tourism type work\nwith some\nroutes that they have put together and\nthat type of thing so gonna go up there\non their way home from angelfire new\nmexico back to eastern kansas what\nhappens to the fall along the way so i'm\ngonna stop and get a ride in this\nafternoon look around town a little bit\nand see what i think so\nlooking forward to it stick around and\nsee what you think\n[Applause]\nokay we are here\nto start the uh\ndirty trinidad classic route 60 some\nmile\nit's gonna be warm out there today\nbut uh looking forward to it\nlooks like a nice area ride a bike\nlooking forward to this route\ni think there's quite a bit of climbing\nfroze might get a little rough we'll see\noh\nwait a minute what you're talking\ncourse decent climb here\ni feel it\nthis is definitely where the planes meet\nthe mountains\nyou can see a long way on the plains\nfrom this little spot\nthere ain't much out here\ntrinidad's back that way\nand then\nsoon we'll be turning left\nheading west\nover toward those peaks i believe\ninto those hills\nit's cool these are nice roads\nbad news\nthat's reins\nhe's not playing for that\ncould be\nthat's me interesting me\ncrossing over i-25\num\nfree\ndoing it now feeling that heat\nit's been slowly climbing for a while\ni think the big time is about stuck\nwe also got\nstorm blooming\nlooks like it's coming right to\ni me say i'm feeling great\ni'm still moving\ni guess that's something\nwe're in the thick of it\nroad started to get\na bit rougher\nat the same time it started raining so\nyou can see it's starting to\nstick a little more tire\nnot\ngood\nraining hard it's cold\nrain is slowed down so i'm\ntaking a little walk break feeling\npretty rough\nthe road is not too bad you can see my\ntrack there but\nit could be worse\nas i made it to the top\nbad news it's getting\nagain sticky getting slick\ngetting to be more clay just chatted\nwith the guy checking pumps and uh\nhe said it might get better\nshouldn't get too much worse as far as\nthe road so we'll see\nthe things we do for fun\nis\nman\nthere was a stretch of highway there i\ndid not enjoy\nthe hill kind of sucked but there was no\nshoulder for a bit and uh\nhe's like a 65 mile an hour\ndon't love that stretch\nman i was hoping we were done with this\nclimbing stuff\nwe're not\nout\ni got a little bit exciting\nhere at the end\nuh\nthis\ncould be interesting\nsee how this goes\nyeah\ni could do without this section\nrailroad grade\nthe gravel\ni've been riding on this\ndeep rock\nfor miles\nand it\nis not\nawesome\ni just rode right to hell into that\nbarbed wire fence\ntrying to figure out\nwhere this freaking route goes\nwait\nwell that is it on the trinidad\ntrip\njust there for a day for an afternoon\nnew ride\ncame to the lake heading out the next\nmorning\na few thoughts on my ride yesterday\ncertainly i appreciate the mix of\nriding out on the flats and the scenery\nthere then heading up into the\nhills so i thought that was a pretty\ncool part of the ride\ngood bit of climbing\nwhich this part of the world i suppose\nthat's going to be standard no matter\nwhat\ndirty trinidad classic route is what i\nrode yesterday\na little bit of room for improvement\nhere and there but i certainly\nappreciate the curated route approach\nputting some things out there so when i\nheaded into town yesterday i could just\npick from a few didn't have to worry\nabout trying to build something from\nscratch and you know with the good\nstretches to try and get on the route or\nnot so\ni appreciate the approach very much\nthat they're taking trying to\nrecruit some you know gravel cycling\ntourism\nand to be to be honest that's why i came\nto trinidad it's because i saw some of\nthe routes they put together the gravel\ngarage the gravel guide\nso i think that's a great idea\nfor towns like trinidad to put together\nlooks like a really cool town\nthere's a blues festival going on this\nweekend\nso a lot of the streets were closed\npretty busy by the time i got back to\nfrom my ride so i didn't get to look\naround as much as i'd hoped to\nbut uh i do intend to visit again i\nthink there's enough going on in town\nplaces to eat coffee shops all that kind\nof thing\nthat'll make for a nice uh\ncouple day destination vacation\ndestination\nyeah it's still nice to ride somewhere\ndifferent see some different roads when\neverything is new that's always a\nmuch more enjoyable for me than\nriding roads i've been on before\nso\ni like to come back ride some different\nroutes different areas\nlooks like from trinidad there's lots of\nhills and getting into the mountains if\nyou head west northwest\neven a little bit south after near raton\npass\nif you head northeast it's pretty much\nwhere the planes come\nin butt up against the hills and\nmountains\nso nice mix of everything\nas far as a place to ride\ni was getting lost",

          "transcript": "Colorado has an abundance of gravel race\nriches this year including a new series\ncalled the colorado summer of gravel\nthis new series runs mid-may through\nJuly and includes CO2 UT in the desert\nof Western Colorado the Telluride gravel\nrace in the mountainous South Ned gravel\nhigh up in central Colorado just up the\nhill from my home in Boulder and foco\nFondo to the North in Fort Collins\ncombined is quite the varied tour of\nColorado's diverse topography and gravel\nservices for instance I did focofondo\nlast year on my NV road bike with 32s\nand I did Ned gravel last year on a laof\nTrue Grit with that leaf suspension fork\nand honestly I would have been happy on\na mountain bike I have not yet done\nTelluride nor CO2 UT but I intend to\nremedy that soon\nforeign\n[Music]\nthe series concept is relatively new to\ngravel racing and unlike the big dollar\nlifetime Grand Prix and the Belgian\nwaffle ride series Each of which\nfeatures seven events operated by the\nsame owner the Colorado summer of gravel\nis a partnership between four\nindependent events\nWhitney and Zach Allison run focofondo\nand they helped spearhead the Coalition\nwith Telluride and Ned gravel and CO2 UT\nthe scene here for cycling particularly\nbike racing has changed a lot here in\nColorado in the last couple of years a\nlot of the road racing opportunities\nhave really dwindled and one of the\nhopes for Colorado summer of gravel is\nto provide an Avenue and outlet and a\nreally great series that doesn't require\nextensive travel or\ntons of money in order to participate in\nit I really hope it provides an\nopportunity for up-and-coming Racers to\ncontinue to grow in the sport and use\nthis as a way to keep repelling\nthemselves forward\njust like with the Grand Prix and the\nBelgian waffle ride series you don't\nhave to do the whole series of course\nyou can sign up for events individually\nbut by registering for all four you can\nsave a little money and qualify for the\nthree thousand dollars on tap to do the\nfour races it's 500 bucks for the\nColorado series for context Unbound\ngravel one entry is two hundred and\nninety dollars now I'm not trying to\ndissuade you from doing the big ones I\nthink there's certainly something to be\nsaid for doing one of the monuments of\ngravel whether that's Unbound or\nSteamboat or Belgian waffle ride\nCalifornia or the Mid-South but I'm also\na proponent of doing smaller races where\nyou will have a ton of fun and most\nlikely feel a lot less pressure and\nstress about the whole thing\nso let's take a quick look at the main\nevents for each of the four races which\nall offer shorter distances as well\nc-o-t-u-t in Fruita kicks it off May 14.\ndubbed desert gravel this is the\nflattest and sandiest event in the\nseries at 100 miles and 5 000 feet of\nelevation gain this race is 159 if\npurchased separately Telluride is a\nsecond year event last year former U.S\nnational champion Alex house and my\nbuddy Betsy Welch took the wins in the\nmen's and women's races respectively\nBetsy texted me halfway through the race\nhey is it uh okay to keep racing on a\nBroken Spoke\nevidently it was this race is the\nclimbiest of the lot with 85 miles\nbringing in about 10 000 feet of\nelevation gain this race costs 145\ndollars hey this is Scott benge with the\nTelluride growl race going into our\nsecond year we couldn't be more excited\nto be involved in the Colorado summer of\ngravel series what intrigued us the most\nabout the series is the smaller\nindependent races that make it up all\nacross the state not having to make\nmajor travel plans and being able to\nparticipate in a series with a prize\npurse right here in our great state of\nColorado is super special so we can't\nwait to see you all out there Ned gravel\nis only 60 miles but I'm here to tell\nyou it is a brutal 60 miles with 7100\nfeet of climbing it starts over 8 000\nfeet in Netherland and the route tackles\nSwitzerland Trail which is rough\nthis race is 110 dollars if done alone\nhey I'm Gavin Coombs the race director\nfor Ned gravel bike race uh we are so\nexcited to be part of the Colorado\nsummer of gravel\num you're just going to be showcasing\nthe best of Colorado gravel and\neverything that Colorado has to offer an\ninclusive and welcoming way that is just\ngoing to be great for everyone for the\nseries Nate gravel is offering up our\ntungsten course which is new for this\nyear at 70 miles and 8 300 feet of\nclimbing it's a challenging course made\nsome changes over the last couple of\nyears to it it's going to be bigger and\nbetter than ever\nso come on out see what Colorado has to\noffer for gravel and we'll see out there\nand then focal Fondo starts and finishes\nat New Belgium brewery just on the\noutskirts of downtown Fort Collins\nthe 118 mile event is the main one this\nyear last year I got third in the 100\nMiler while Alexi vermeulen won the 140\nmiler I doubt I will be on the podium\nthis year the 118 mile course is new for\n2023 for foco Fondo it kind of rounds\nout a mix of the 100 mile course that\nhas less climbing from the last few\nyears and the 145 that was a little bit\ntoo much to have so much fun on from\n2022 so hopefully the 118 while still\nhaving extra climbs the super fun\nlollipop going into the mountains will\nbe the best of both worlds for this new\nfocofondo course\nfor great gravel races and one nice\nprice if you want to go all in on the\nseries Colorado gravel racing kicks off\nhere in a few weeks with old man winter\nrally February 5th last year Alex and\nanother former U.S national road\nChampion Ruth Winder took the wins we'll\nsee who comes out on top this year and\nthen we've got a full spring summer and\nfall of gravel races with more than a\ndozen good events here in Colorado those\ninclude\nWild Horse Weld County grinder mad\ngravel Pony Express Bighorn gravel\ncrooked gravel Steamboat the gun and\ngrinder slide off 76 High Plains Drifter\ngravo Locos and rad dirt Fest both of\nwhich happen to be on September 30th in\nSouthern Colorado I'll put links to each\nof those races down below which you can\ncheck out after you hit that subscribe\nbutton\nit all adds up to a full four seasons of\ngreat Colorado gravel racing with a\nsummer of gravel now a smack in the\nmiddle of it I hope to see you out there\nat one of these great events\nthank you",

After 113 miles of racing, riders face a final left turn onto Main Street to reach the finish. The course includes difficult sections of deep rock gravel that riders find challenging to ride on for extended distances. Weather can be a factor with sudden storms making clay-like road surfaces sticky and slick. One particularly tough section involves highway riding with 65 mph traffic and no shoulder. The race has tactical elements beyond pure fitness, with riders playing chess match games especially at the bottom of climbs. Trinidad has developed gravel cycling tourism with curated routes for visitors. The community strongly supports the event with local businesses and volunteers partnering to make the race possible."
