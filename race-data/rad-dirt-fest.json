      "prestige": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Life Time owns this race, which means corporate polish but zero grassroots soul. Keegan Swenson showed up once in 2024 and won by 83 seconds over Stetina, but it's still fighting for relevance against UNBOUND. The Grand Prix inclusion gives it credibility, but getting dropped from 2025 then added back for 2026 screams second-tier status."
      },
      "race_quality": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "90% maintained gravel roads that riders call 'champagne gravel' and 'buttery smooth' - this isn't your typical Colorado washboard nightmare. Aid stations every 20-30 miles with proper cutoff times, though that 31-mile no-service stretch will expose the unprepared. Life Time's event machine delivers professional execution, even if it lacks character."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Spanish Peaks backdrop at 9,000 feet with views that make the suffering worthwhile - 'every grueling climb rewarded with mesmerizing views' as one rider put it. The transition from high desert to aspen forests delivers Colorado beauty without the Leadville death march. Trinidad's old west character adds authenticity that most corporate events lack."
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Gravel community shows up hard here - riders consistently praise it as 'incredible and accepting' with particular support for women racers described as 'absolute beasts.' 1,000+ cyclists from 40 states and 11 countries proves drawing power. The welcoming atmosphere builds confidence rather than crushes souls, which is rarer than you'd think."
      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Swenson, Stetina, Vermeulen, and De Crescenzo's three straight wins show decent elite participation, but it's not UNBOUND depth. Life Time's Grand Prix connection brings quality riders, but the field thins quickly after the top 10. It's a stepping stone race for many, not a destination event for the deepest talent."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "50 UNBOUND qualifier coins split between 70 and 110-mile distances gives you two shots at the golden ticket. Three distance options mean you're not locked into one suffer-fest, and that 'buttery smooth' gravel delivers performance without destroying equipment. Life Time's production value exceeds most regional events at comparable pricing."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Trinidad isn't Aspen pricing, but it's not free either - you'll need lodging since this isn't a day trip for most. Life Time registration fees match their corporate overhead, and getting to southern Colorado requires commitment. The Spanish Peaks Inn crew access point suggests decent accommodation options, but budget accordingly."
      },
      "length": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "62 miles hits the sweet spot between 'why bother' and 'please make it stop' - it's the Anteloop distance that bridges desert terrain with snowcapped mountain views. Not long enough to be epic, not short enough to be easy. Perfect for building confidence before attempting the 110-mile Stubborn Delores masochism."
      },
      "technicality": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "That 2-mile South Shore Trail technical section and Burro Canyon's 9-mile climb will test handling skills despite the 'champagne gravel' reputation. 90% maintained roads mean consistent surfaces, but elevation changes and two-track sections demand real bike handling. Not Leadville technical, but far from a rail-trail cruise."
      },
      "elevation": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "8,202 feet of climbing from 6,025 feet starting elevation to nearly 9,000 at the top - this isn't flat Colorado plains riding. The gradual nature means sustainable power over grinding climbs, but that altitude will find your weak spots. Views of Fisher's Peak and Spanish Peaks justify the leg-burning ascents."
      },
      "climate": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Late September offers 73-80°F highs with 51°F lows, but that high desert environment creates hydration challenges - expect 'chapped lips, dry throat, empty bottles.' 72% sunshine sounds nice until you're exposed for hours. Wind averages 14.7 mph, which becomes a factor on those open mesas."
      },
      "altitude": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Starting at 6,025 feet and climbing to 9,000 feet means sea-level riders will feel it immediately. That thin air compounds the 8,200+ feet of elevation gain into suffering. Trinidad's elevation isn't Leadville brutal, but it's enough to separate the adapted from the foolish."
      },
      "logistics": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Life Time's corporate machine delivers professional organization, but that 31-mile stretch with no cell service between aid stations creates anxiety for many riders. Three crew access points help, but Trinidad's remote location means limited backup options. Spanish Peaks Inn checkpoint at mile 42.8 provides key support, assuming you make the 1:20 PM cutoff."
      },
      "adventure": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "4,775 square miles of Las Animas County gravel roads deliver exploration through Colorado's largest county. Old railroad ruins, dilapidated mining history, and transition from high desert to alpine forests create real discovery. That no-service 31-mile section forces self-reliance that most corporate events avoid."
      }
    },
    "final_verdict": {
      "score": "71 / 100",
      "one_liner": "The Rad serves up champagne gravel and Spanish Peaks views, but that 31-mile no-service stretch will expose every training shortcut you took.",
      "should_you_race": "If you can hold steady watts for five hours at altitude without external validation, this is your race. The gravel is buttery smooth, but 8,900 feet doesn't negotiate with your sea-level fitness. Show up undertrained and that remote backcountry section becomes a very expensive therapy session.",
      "alternatives": "BWR California gives you similar smooth surfaces without the altitude punishment, while Gravel Worlds in Nebraska delivers comparable distances on flatter terrain. Both let you suffer closer to civilization."
