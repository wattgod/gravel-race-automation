        "explanation": "Packet pickup requires Thursday attendance at Adelaide Tour Village expo, but the mass start creates positioning issues. One rider noted \"turning up to the starting chute with 4min before the gun went off didn't help my chances of getting into an early bunch.\" Shuttles to Adelaide help post-race, but getting 300+ riders through the neutral zone efficiently remains problematic."

The finish line was a welcome sight.\" Three distance options from 34km to 127km mean you can choose your pain level without the course feeling watered down. Longer than Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "About 67% gravel ranging from \"champagne gravel\" to sections where riders found \"the sand unrideable on a couple of occasions.\" The terrain includes \"fast flowing descents with a range of surfaces, from perfect limestone, rutted out tracks to scary sand.\" Technical enough that pros like Cameron Jones punctured twice on technical descents. Similar technical demands to Gravel Worlds."

      "elevation": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "The opening \"Bang Average Climb of just under 3km at an average of 8.2%\" starts the suffering within 15 minutes, with some riders \"already run out of gears and were pushing their bikes up hill.\" The full 2000+ meters includes \"a few category 3 and 4 climbs, which are significantly harder on gravel than bitumen.\" More climbing than SBT GRVL at the same score."
      },
      "climate": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "January means serious heat - \"temperatures in the low 30s [Celsius]\" created hydration crises in 2026. One rider carried 3L bladder plus two bottles but \"ran out of water with almost 45min to go\" and required marshal assistance. The 7:30am start helps beat peak heat, but riders describe \"dust and heat\" as defining race characteristics. Similar climate challenges to SBT GRVL."

        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Adelaide Hills sounds mountainous but you're still near sea level in South Australia. Zero altitude training benefit and zero thin-air challenge. The climbing difficulty comes entirely from gradient and distance, not elevation above sea level. Lower altitude than Gravel Worlds — no thin-air concerns."

        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "\"Starting and finishing amidst the stunning vineyards of Oliver and Press Winemakers\" leads to \"hidden gravel roads that wind their way through forests and groves of gum trees before descending back into wine country.\" Tiffany Cromwell calls these \"unpaved roads around my hometown of Adelaide\" a \"well-kept secret\" that showcases terrain most tourists never see."

      "race_quality": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Romain Bardet's winning time of \"3 hours and 30 minutes\" over 127km shows how fast this course runs despite the climbing. The race splits early and stays selective - Nicole Frain's solo breakaway \"hit one minute by 25km\" and grew to \"over three minutes by the SRAM Oasis aid station at 80km\" as heat and climbs fractured the field."

The 12.5% DNF rate (\"over 50/400 recorded a DNF\") shows the field includes riders who bite off more than they can handle, but international elite participation keeps competitive standards high. Similar competitive depth to Rule of Three."

        "explanation": "Four-day cycling experience during Tour Down Under week includes expo, pro panels, beach rides, and post-race parties.

Complimentary Buffalo Bash entry and cooling towels show attention to rider experience details."

      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Registration runs A$150. January timing coincides with Australian summer tourism peak and Tour Down Under week, driving up accommodation costs. Alexey Vermeulen's comment about wishing \"he'd brought\" narrower tires \"to Australia\" highlights the travel commitment required. At least McLaren Vale wine country and Adelaide's cycling culture during TDU week justify the expense for cycling tourists. Similar expense level to Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."
