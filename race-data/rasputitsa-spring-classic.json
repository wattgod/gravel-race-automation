The Russian name means 'mud season when roads become difficult to traverse.' Similar climate challenges to SBT GRVL."

Lower altitude than Gravel Worlds — no thin-air concerns."

Weather that's 'merciless on wheeled transport' means you'll earn stories worth telling. This homegrown event puts you at nature's mercy, not some sanitized gravel theme park.

The homegrown organization shows in practical details—mass start led by founder's truck through downtown, clear bailout instructions, and 'We won't leave anyone out there' messaging."

One competitive rider noted being 'one of Very Few not wearing a full road cycling kit,' suggesting the field skews toward weekend warriors over serious racers in remote Vermont. Less competitive depth than Almanzo 100.

      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Registration runs $80-120. Burke offers everything from B&Bs to campgrounds, giving you options beyond resort pricing. But this is remote northern Vermont—you're not finding budget motels everywhere. The Wildflower Inn promotes race packages, which means local businesses know how to extract tourist dollars from gravel pilgrims. Similar expense level to Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."
