Short enough that proper fueling strategy becomes the deciding factor rather than endurance capacity. More compact than Grinduro.

The 2019 extreme weather saw 'even some of the pros needed to stop due to hypothermia.' Similar competitive depth to Rule of Three.

        "explanation": "Registration runs $80-$120. Jay Peak Resort hosting provides lodging but likely at resort pricing during race weekend. Equipment debates become costly—Matthew Vandivort's tire choice proved inadequate while Scott Miller 'swapped out the MTB tires for some gravel tires' and later concluded 'if I ever do Rasputitsa again, I will ride a gravel bike.' Chris Burati's wrong cassette choice (11-28 instead of 11-32) demonstrates gear-specific requirements."

      "should_you_race": "If you can handle 46 miles of sustained climbing in conditions that range from perfect to apocalyptic, Rasputitsa delivers authentic Northeast Kingdom suffering without the ego. The 5,000 feet of elevation isn't negotiable, and April weather means you might get snow, mud, or sunshine—sometimes all three. Skip this if you need predictable conditions or hate climbing.",
