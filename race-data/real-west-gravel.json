      },
      "race_quality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "94% pure Pendleton gravel sounds promising, but the course details are vaguer than a weather forecast. They can't even nail down consistent distances across their own marketing - is it 68 miles, 67, or 66? When basic race specs are this sloppy, don't expect precision elsewhere."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Rolling hills through 'untapped Eastern Oregon gravel areas rarely ridden before' could be gold or could be boring farm roads nobody rides for good reason. Without rider reports or course specifics beyond marketing speak, you're buying a lottery ticket. The 9:30am start at least shows they understand March daylight."
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Pendleton's tourism folks are clearly invested - $30 lodging kickback and official quotes about 'world-class hospitality' from Travel Pendleton. Packet pickup at Prodigal Sons Brewery shows local business buy-in. For a young race, they've built decent community partnerships, even if the field depth isn't there yet."
      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "500 rider cap with no mentioned pro field or competitive categories. Zero notable past winners or elite participation in the research. This is weekend warrior territory, which is fine, but don't expect to test yourself against serious competition."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "$135 early bird for 62+ miles of gravel, fully stocked aid stations, mechanical support, and swag is solid pricing. Even the late registration at $160 beats most comparable events. The $10 GranFondoGuide discount code sweetens it further - rare to see actual savings opportunities."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Pendleton sits 3 hours from PDX, Boise, or Spokane - pick your poison for flight costs. Lodging kickback of $30 helps offset accommodation costs in a smaller town. Remote location means you're committed to the weekend, but Eastern Oregon isn't Napa Valley pricing."
      },
      "length": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "The long course hits that sweet spot around 62-68 miles depending on which marketing material you believe. Not a epic suffer-fest, not a charity ride. The 50-mile option gives flexibility for different fitness levels without compromising the main event's credibility."
      },
      "technicality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Pure gravel doesn't tell you much about actual technical demands. 'Rolling hills' and 'challenging yet rewarding for riders of all skill levels' sounds like diplomatic code for 'not too scary.' Eastern Oregon can serve up legitimate technical terrain, but this course description suggests they're playing it safe."
      },
      "elevation": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "3000 feet over 62 miles averages about 50 feet per mile - respectable but not mountainous. The 'rolling hills' description suggests steady grinding rather than punchy climbs. Enough to hurt if you're soft, not enough to break strong riders."
      },
      "climate": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "March in Eastern Oregon is a gamble - could be perfect spring conditions or late winter misery. Their marketing claims 'March was never better for Gravel' but provides zero historical weather data to back it up. No mention of typical wind, mud, or temperature ranges means you're rolling dice."
      },
      "altitude": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Pendleton sits around 1200 feet elevation - basically sea level for most cyclists. No altitude considerations unless you're coming from Death Valley. The rolling terrain might add a few hundred feet but nothing that impacts performance or requires acclimatization."
      },
      "logistics": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Three hours minimum from any major airport kills easy travel. Packet pickup schedule is reasonable with brewery option the night before. Pendleton Community Park start 'minutes off I-84' helps with access, but small town infrastructure and remote location create natural bottlenecks."
      },
      "adventure": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "'Untamed beauty of Eastern Oregon' and 'rarely ridden gravel areas' sound adventurous until you realize it might just be empty because it's boring. The North Loop route from downtown could showcase genuine Western landscape or agricultural monotony. Without rider reports, the adventure factor remains theoretical marketing."
