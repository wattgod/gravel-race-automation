Matthew Wiebe notes the 9:30am start with packet pickup Saturday at Prodigal Sons Brewery or race morning at Pendleton Community Park. However, brutal conditions can emerge—2025 saw temps drop to mid-30s with strong headwinds that forced one elite rider to abandon mid-race due to cold. As Mechanical Support Available puts it: \"Mechanical support is at the venue and aid station 1,2,3\""

Matthew Wiebe observed that \"course is only ~65 miles long too so with a smaller group that means basically any major move will be important.\" Early attacks matter more on shorter distances, as demonstrated when his mile-6 move whittled the field to just three riders rotating through the long false flat sections. Similar distance to Crusher in the Tushar."

        "explanation": "Pure gravel doesn't tell you much about actual technical demands.

Eastern Oregon can serve up technical terrain, but this course description suggests they're playing it safe. Less technical than The Mid South."

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "The 67-mile course averages 60 feet of climbing per mile with over 5,000 feet total—respectable but not mountainous. The profile features a \"nice steep kicker\" at mile 6 followed by \"truly long and arduous false flat\" sections with kickers thrown in. Matthew Wiebe noted the final approach includes a \"13-mile false flat descent into town\" before a steep 0.75-mile finishing climb. Less climbing than The Mid South."

More weather exposure than Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

        "explanation": "Pendleton sits around 1200 feet elevation - basically sea level for most cyclists. No altitude considerations unless you're coming from Death Valley. The rolling terrain might add a few hundred feet but nothing that impacts performance or requires acclimatization. Modest altitude compared to Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "'Untamed beauty of Eastern Oregon' and 'rarely ridden gravel areas' sound adventurous until you realize it might just be empty because it's boring. The North Loop route from downtown could showcase Western landscape or agricultural monotony. Without rider reports, the adventure factor remains theoretical marketing."

      "race_quality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "The course reveals poor weather planning and maintenance issues. Brutal 2025 conditions prompted organizers to \"reevaluate the course layout for future events\" and \"shift the race to the north side in 2026, where a more maintained road system will help mitigate the muddy conditions.\" Mechanical failures plagued multiple riders, with GRX shifters locking into crash mode and drivetrains clogging with mud."
      },

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Rolling hills through 'untapped Eastern Oregon gravel areas rarely ridden before' could be gold or could be boring farm roads nobody rides for good reason. Without rider reports or course specifics beyond marketing speak, you're buying a lottery ticket. The 9:30am start at least shows they understand March daylight."

When a rider crashed, Ryan \"made the selfless decision to stay behind and assist an injured rider—putting community before competition.\" Race organizers praised this as \"the kind of integrity we're proud to see in the sport.\" Post-race includes Pendleton Catering meals and support from local volunteers from Pendleton On Wheels."

The race day conditions were wet and windy making for a very challenging 60+ miles of cycling (suffering) in the countryside around Pendleton.  Warning,  there is no music added to this vid.. just the sound of wind, grunts, heaving breathing and the odd curse word from me.  It's also long so if TikTok is your thing, skip to around the 12min mark to see some mud,  a little later for a train and soon after that, some farm animals.\n\nThanks to Mudslinger and the town of Pendleton for a memorable event in another beautiful part of Oregon.",
