        "explanation": "Getting to Ketchum means flying into Sun Valley Airport or driving mountain roads from Boise.

Once you're there, the festival setup handles most needs, but you're dealing with resort town pricing and limited accommodation options during Labor Day weekend."

It's long enough to separate the weekend warriors from the real riders, especially when you add 6,200 feet of climbing at altitude. The distance forces pacing decisions early and punishes poor fueling choices later. Longer than Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

      "technicality": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "The route rolls over Trail Creek Summit and through Copper Basin on mostly gravel roads rather than true technical terrain. You're dealing with loose gravel, some washboard, and potentially muddy conditions, but this isn't rock garden navigation or steep singletrack. The challenge comes from sustained climbing and distance more than bike handling skills. Similar technical demands to Gravel Worlds. As Edyn Teitge puts it: \"I was pretty excited for the TT because one of my strong points is climbing... The climb was pretty steep and we gained over 1000 ft, but I was able to maintain a speed of around 10 mph.\""

      "elevation": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "6,200 feet of climbing over 103 miles means consistent grinding rather than explosive climbs. Trail Creek Summit hits 7,900 feet, then you descend into remote Copper Basin before more rolling elevation through the high country. The sustained nature of the climbing, combined with thin air, makes this difficult even for strong riders. More climbing than SBT GRVL at the same score. As Edyn Teitge puts it: \"I was pretty excited for the TT because one of my strong points is climbing... The climb was pretty steep and we gained over 1000 ft, but I was able to maintain a speed of around 10 mph.\""

Labor Day weekend in the Idaho mountains can swing from perfect conditions to cold rain or even early snow. The 2023 edition dealt with showers and fog that had riders questioning their gear choices. At elevation, weather changes fast and temperature swings are real, but it's not the brutal heat of desert races or guaranteed suffering of winter events. Similar climate challenges to SBT GRVL."

        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Starting at nearly 6,000 feet in Ketchum and climbing to 7,900 feet over Trail Creek Summit puts serious altitude stress on sea-level riders. Much of the route stays in the 6,000-7,500 foot range, meaning you're breathing thin air for the entire ride. Riders traveling from lower elevations consistently report the altitude impact being worse than expected. Higher altitude racing, comparable to SBT GRVL."

        "score": 5,
        "explanation": "This route drops you into wilderness through Copper Basin, where mechanicals or bonking become real problems miles from help. The combination of remote terrain, high altitude, and variable mountain weather creates consequences for poor decisions. You're riding through country where cell service disappears and the next rider might be an hour behind you.

          "transcript": "[Music]\nhello everyone it's Jackson from fast\ncat today it is a gorgeous July day here\nin Idaho I am on the kind of main stage\nmain course of Rebecca's Private Idaho\ngoing to show you all some of the key\nsections discuss some of the tactics\nsome of the important considerations for\nthis race coming up in a little over a\nmonth now so you kind of roll from the\ntown of catching them pretty neutral\nuntil you hit the first main climb of\nthe day Trail Creek summit it's about a\n30-minute ish climb depending on how\nfast you're going half of it is paved\nhalf is dirt so I will show you what\nthat looks like\nso like I said these climb starts off\npaved it's about six percent average ish\npretty good pavement but soon we'll hit\nthe dirt\nso the road surface of this climb and\nbasically all of Rebekah's course it's\npretty rocky pretty bumpy definitely can\npick a good line so you probably\nshouldn't need more than a thirty five\nmil tire to get through the day\nyou could even probably run a 32 if\nyou're feeling ambitious but\nas you can see it's pretty smooth\ndefinitely gonna have some washboards on\nthis course because a lot of those kind\nof like four-wheeler the vehicles use\nthis road during the summer so this\nclimb is very much a crux section of the\nwhole course because it's followed up by\na fast downhill and then a very fast\nlong straight section so if you don't go\nover the top with a good group you're\ngonna be chasing for a long time because\nas you can see from this about twenty to\nthirty minute climb if you go over the\ntop of this by yourself you're gonna be\nchasing for a long time because the rest\nof the Copper Basin loop the chorus is\npretty Rolly pretty flat and gradual but\nsuper fast and so it's super super at\nparamount to be in a good group and a\nbig mistake that a lot of people make is\nthey also can go too hard over the climb\nand get into a group that is is too hard\nfor them this has happened to me many\ntimes and then they get dropped and find\nthemselves in kind of no-man's land in\nthat sort of gradual rolling section\nbetween the climb and the rest of the\ncourse use a lot of energy and it's\nreally early on in the race so you have\nto be prepared for you got to be ready\nto kind of suffer through to get into a\ngood group\nso once you getting back into the trees\nright here this is the top you kind of\nround a corner you see the National\nForest sign there will be an aid station\nhere but you probably won't need to stop\nbecause it's very early on in the race\nso the descent off the kom as you can\nsee isn't too steep but it's pretty fast\npretty straight nothing too crazy in\nterms of cornering when we wrote it the\nroad is definitely very washboard it out\na lot of pretty big chunky rocks so you\nhave to pick your line pretty well and\nnot take it too fast but it's over\npretty quick\nprobably around five minutes or less and\nthen you are on to the fast straight\nkind of slightly downhill section that\nis about ten miles before you hit the\nright turn into the actual Copper Basin\nloop\nall right so once you take that right\nturn on to kind of the main section of\nthe course you will do this huge about\n22 mile loop called Copper Basin it's\npretty rough roads honestly when we\nwrote it pretty bumpy wash 40 it was\njust even too hard to film out there\nit's gonna be hot it's gonna be dusty\nand so it's it's definitely a sufferfest\nyou got to get into a good group it's\npretty rollin nothing too crazy in terms\nof climbing but it kind of goes on\nforever so once you make that 22 mile\nloop you come you come back the same way\nyou you came in sort of a lollipop style\nand then the 10-mile slog back up to the\nback side of Trail Creek the climb is in\nmy opinion probably the hardest most\nintensely mental part of the of the\nwhole course because it's really\nstraight it's just slightly uphill\nusually a huge headwind and insanely\ninsanely brutal at the end of that race\nand then you still have the climb\nalthough the climb on the backside is\nmuch more calm and short but then the\ndescent coming back down into town is\npretty ripping and so you'll head over\nthe top of the climb and the descent is\na little bit more technical a little bit\nmore fast for the it's basically the\nback set you know the original climb\nthat you climbed up and then you'll hit\nthe pavement back into Trail Creek Road\nback into town which is pretty short but\nsuper fast you'll be really wrecked by\nthis point and what tends to happen here\nis that people get caught little groups\nform it's pretty broken up but the race\ncan definitely come down to a sprint and\nso just be prepared to save a little bit\nin the reserves for this downhill super\nfast section back into the finish\n[Applause]",

          "transcript": "Yes, Iddaho has gravel. Lots of gravel\nroads. Plenty of them. And in this\nvideo, I'm going to take you along on a\nlittle sampling of some very, very fine\nIdaho gravel roads. Stay tuned.\n[Music]\nYes, Idaho has gravel roads. Granny gear\nhere for old guy in a bike. It does. And\nI went and sampled some of it. 57 miles\nor so of it just recently. And that's\nwhat this video is all about. I went\nback to Ketchum Sun Valley, Idaho, a\nplace I hadn't been to in probably 10\nyears. And once again, I rode a part of\nthe event called Rebecca's Private\nIdaho. That was at one time just a\none-day gravel race now is more of a\nstage race. There's things going on all\nweekend. You can go participate and then\nyou know kind of the stage race format,\ndifferent things on different days and\nyou end up being the champion or\nsomething like that. Now I was just\ndoing the one-day event. In the past I'd\ndone the 90 mile version twice and the\n50 mile version twice and uh you know I\nreally wasn't interested in training for\nthe for the 100 this year. I just wanted\nto go ride it. So I went and rode the 57\nmile version. That was enough for this\nold guy. had a great day on the bike. Uh\nwe rolled into Ketchum Sun Valley on\nFriday, Saturday morning, got up, walked\nover to the registration area, got my\nnumber, all that stuff taken care of.\nEnded up running into Rebecca Rush. Now,\nRebecca Rush is the Rebecca of Rebecca's\nPrivate Idaho. And if you don't know who\nshe is, well, she is an female athlete\nof renown, a multi-sport athlete with a\nlong long palm Marius of victories and\nand races won and whatnot. She's she's\nsignificant person in the history of\nmountain biking and gravel racing. Now,\nshe also is an author and a podcaster\nand I'll put some links to her podcast\nand she did a video talking about her\ndad who had um died. I think it was the\nVietnam War if I had have that right and\nher journey toward kind of looking for\nclosure and all of that. And so, um,\nyeah, fabulous, fabulous book and video\nthat she did. And now, you know, she has\na podcast and some things on YouTube\nshe's starting to develop. But Rebecca,\nshe's a fabulous person. I'm glad that I\nknow her. All right, said goodbye to\nRebecca and we rolled over to the expo\nthat was set up around the registration\narea. I spent a little bit of time\nthere. I ended up with a pretty cool\nsample of these water bottles that have\na really different take on how you get\nwater out of an insulated bottle. It's\nkind of a stainless steel thing that's\ngetting be popular. We got one. We're\ngoing to check that out. My favorite\nbooth though was Party Shirt\nInternational. Man, these guys have got\nquite the vibe going on as you can see\nfrom the video here. And uh I actually\nended up with a couple samples. Then we\nbought a couple more from Mrs. Granny\nGear. So, we are all set to party in our\nparty shirt international. Be talking\nabout those. I'll be showing you in the\nvideo. Um, yeah, really actually I just\nabout kind of lived in that party shirt\nthe whole rest of the time I was in\nIdaho. Well, we left the expo and we\nwalked into town and watched the parade\nhappening. There's a big old parade that\ngoes on in catch them on this Labor Day\nweekend. I think I heard it's the\nlargest non-motorized parade in the West\nor in the world or something like that.\nPretty cool. And at the end of it, they\ngot this big old ore wagon, guys. There\nwas a mining history to the area like\ntypical. So, you can see you've got a\nwhole team of I think they were draft\nhorses, but I thought they used to be\nmules. Maybe they use both. I don't\nknow. But it's a huge event to get this\nthing to turn a 90° corner. You can see\nthe how it works. You've got this whole\ncrew. Each one's got a horse and they're\nkind or a mule, whichever it would be\nthat day. and they're kind of walking\nthem around through the corner and\nthere's people steering the two or I\nthink there's three wagons linked\ntogether. You'll see it in the video. I\ndon't remember. We got people breaking,\npeople steering and it is quite a\nprocess to get this thing to turn around\nthe corner. Very, very fun. Well, from\nthere really it was just time to head\nback to the condo, get a good dinner,\ngood night's sleep because the next day\nit was time to ride. So, the next day\nwas race morning and we gathered in a\npark area, kind of big open field just\noutside of town. Quite a varied amount\nof people as you can see like here's\nthis pretty cool tandem uh getting ready\nto go. I even saw a fat bike there. I\ndon't think if I got any of them on\nvideo, but we had some of the hand\ncycles, you know, I imagine um the\nelectrified ones. I can't remember what\nthose are called. Put up on the screen.\nOh, I think it's is it bowhead?\nSomething like that. Bowhead cycles.\nAnyway, few of those. That was awesome\nto see. I think the Challenge Athlete\nFoundation, it seemed like I saw some\npeople there from that, so maybe they\nhad a presence there. Anyway, awesome to\nsee that. Mostly gravel bikes, few\nmountain bikes, mostly. This is a\ndefinitely a gravel bike event. Well,\ntime ran around and uh it was time to go\nand off we went. And the ride uh comes\nright out onto a a paved road, turns\nleft, and heads up toward the mountains.\nAnd it's about a 16-mi climb. It begins\nat pavement and uh it's just a lovely\nride. You're going past the Sun Valley\nResort area and you're climbing\ngradually, but you're getting warmed up\nbecause what's ahead of you once the\nroad turns to dirt after about six or so\nmiles of riding and just kind of rolling\nalong. Well, it's a pretty significant\nclimb up Trail Creek Road to Trail Creek\nSummit. And that is one of those things\nwhere you just, you know, if you're\ntrying to win, this is going to hurt a\nlot. Me, I'm just out for a good day's\nride. So, I just sat down and spun and\nenjoyed the climb.\nWhen the storm is moving,\nthe sky goes dark and you feel the wind.\nToo much weight just holds you down.\n&gt;&gt; And after a while, well, we summited and\nhit the first sag. I just topped up some\nwater there. Didn't need to eat or\nanything. And off we went. And from\nthere, you start to lose elevation on a\nkind of a chattery gravel road. A little\nbit rough in places. You're always\nlooking for the smooth line and uh well,\nit's just kind of a little bit of zoom\nzoom and you might as well enjoy that\nafter that, you know, hour long or so\nclimb out of town.\nWhen there's no solid ground,\nwalls are closing in and you hear the\nsound\nof your heartbeat through your chest.\nEventually, we kind of turned to a 90°\nturn to the right and we come along to\nthe next sag for the 57 mileer. We\nactually rode past it and went out on\nthis little kind of a little lollipop\nloop and eventually uh we worked our way\nback toward the sag where uh topped back\nup and ate a little bit. Had some pickle\njuice that was the strongest tasting\npickle juice I've ever had. Whiskey is\ngood training for that pickle juice.\nbeyond that, come back out to the main\nroad and that's a little downhill coming\nout of the sag and so you're making\npretty good time. You know, you you've\nbeen from the lollipop, you've been\ngoing downhill and you're thinking,\n\"Wow, this this is great.\" And then,\nwell, that's a little bit of reality\ncheck there right there.\nRemember all that downhill you enjoyed\nafter you hit the summit at Trail Creek\nand then you had the little sag there?\nRemember all that downhill that looks so\ncool on video? Well, now guess what?\nIt's an uphill. And uh you know really\nit's not it's never too bad but it just\nkind of grinds away at you you know and\nuh I can't remember once I haven't done\nthis where I didn't have a headwind and\nat first I'm thinking yay no headwind.\nAh well\nthat didn't last. So yes once again the\nheadwind and a 10 mile or so rolling\nclimb. But you know what? It was so\npretty. It's so open. It's so lovely.\nAnd really,\nhow can you complain about a little wind\nyou\nall the way all the way home?\nSo, after 10 miles or so of searching\nfor that smooth line on those uh\nwashboard corrugated roads, you end up\nin the trees back to the sag and you are\nat the summit of Trail Creek. And from\nthere, well, remember that really,\nreally long climb you did out of town.\nThat's a really, really long downhill\nout of town. So, pretty much at this\npoint, for at least the 57 mileers, the\nwork is over. Now, here I'm going to\nshow a little bit of video. When I'm\ncoming up to the to the sag at uh on the\nway back and before the big drop, you\nknow, you come into the sags, you know,\nas people are ringing bells and they're\nhooting and they're hauling, they got\nlittle cowbells ringing, you know, and I\nhearing all that and and I'm and I'm\nheaded for the sag kind of bearing left.\nYou know what? And I realize that over\nto the right in the road is one of those\num timing strips, right? So, it's timing\npeople. I think there's a KM for the\nclimb. And I guess it's, you know, we\nall have timing chips on our bikes and\nall that, so it's tracking everybody.\nWell, I can't really hear very much as\nof all the people hooting and hollering.\nWell, I they've been hoot and hollering\nfor me. I don't know. No, actually, what\nthey were is the two leaders who were\ngetting ready to win the 100.\nThey're coming up behind me hot and\nheavy. Matt Beers and Peter Sten, I\ndon't know it, but they are coming up\nbehind me about three times as fast as\nI'm going. And they split me right at\nthe at the timing strip and I hear this\non your right and I'm like I just kind\nof freeze and go straight, you know,\nbecause I'm a little loopy in the moment\nand there goes Peter St. There goes Matt\nBeers on my left. Those two guys had\ngone the hundred whatever it isund and\nsomething and about the same time I had\ndone the 50some.\nImpressive. Kudos guys. And I understand\nuh Matt Beers won that. So um I don't\nknow. Congrats guys. You guys are\namazing. Well, I'm going to leave you\nwith uh one big long descent, little bit\nof Musa, and you can enjoy that. Um,\nRebecca's Private Idaho is, I understand\nit, and there's a little blurb up on\ntheir website. If you're planning on\ngoing, they're looking on moving the\nevent to a different time of the year,\nmaybe the Labor Day weekend. Ketchum was\ncrushed by the amount of people that are\nin town for the parade and all the other\nstuff that's going on. And Ketchum has\ngrown a lot. big fancy hotels that\ndidn't used to be there last time I was\nthere and maybe it's not quite the small\ntown vibe that I remember things happen\nlike that. So, uh if you want to go um\nfor 2026, it's going to be a slightly\ndifferent event. I think a different\nlocation and maybe even I was reading\ndifferent routes. So, check it out\nbefore you go. But I hardily recommend\nthat you go do Rea Rebecca's private\nIdo. Whether you want to do the stage\nrace, you want to do the family ride or\nwhat I did the kind of the uh the small\nfry and then there's the the baked\npotato I think is what they call. I even\nheard talk about a twice baked potato,\nsomething like that. That would be a big\nday. I recommend it. Rebecca and her\ncrew do a fabulous job putting this\nevent on. Can't imagine you won't enjoy\nit. All right, that's it. um leave you\nwith the descent into Ketchum, Idaho\nfrom the top of Trail Creek Summit. You\nguys have a great week and or weekend\nand as always, well, you know, go ride\nyour bikes\nin the depths of\nwhere echoes remain.\nYou were the sunrise\nand I was the rain. A collision of souls\nopposing and fly.\nI was the darkness.\nYou yearned for the light.\nNow\nyou're gone.\nAnd I'm losing my mind. Losing my mind.\nI'm losing my mind.\nyou go.\nWhy did you cut me off? We me out and\nleave me high and dry.\nYou were the laughter\nthat kept me alive.\nYou were hello\nwhen I was goodbye\nand amber that flickered\nthen faded away.\nYou were the summer. I was that same old\nshitty me. Now\nyou go\nand I'm losing my mind. Losing my mind.\nWhy did you cut me off? Bring me out and\nyou gone.\nI said, \"Hold on.\"\nYou say goodbye.",

they're suffering\nhottest 45 miles for sure i've ever done\ni think the the hard part comes in when\nyou\nempty the tank\nto finish the uh\nto make the cutoff\nfor the for the uh single truck which is\n19 miles and you have to be done\nby 11 15 we start at 8 30.\nbut it's it's real single truck it's\nlike the the real deal\nuh anyway\ni think about six miles and then\nhome sweet home\nhey how you doing good work good work\nthank you pancake huh\nfour miles\nyeah this stuff is real\nfun course very fun course highly\nrecommend\ntough the nails\nit's from uh\nbut it's for those from the school the\nhard knock\nfour months ago\nwe're nine miles left\ni got nothing left\nlast year last year of the day\nlook at that\nit doesn't look like much but man oh man\ni can't say the mighty of fire this time\nbecause\ni rode man i rode but uh\ntough course ready to be done i need two\ncoca-colas\nand a bunch of food\nin bed oh maybe a shower\ngoing down to the creek to suck the feet\nhelp them\nrecover a little bit faster this is\nnature's ice legs\nnice legs\nmore like ice feeds i don't want to get\nin there fully\nwell we\nsurvived\nwell i mean i survived uh\nrebecca's private idaho well stage one\nthe single truck was real\nit was real it tested the cutthroat to\nits limits uh\n19 miles you had to be done\nby 11 15 we said at 8 30 within 19 miles\nof single track i mean single truck not\nyou know this low flow trails the real\ndeal\nuh survived\nabout 4000 feet of elevation 45 miles\nso pretty hilly route you know no joke\nran out of water\ni want to say with about a mile to go\nout of water and\nand i felt like i was gonna do that well\nthis is the high desert but i did\nsurvive um my neighbor over there\ni did survive\nto uh to ride again tomorrow 50 miles\ntomorrow\nbut look at the uh\nlook at the the drivetrain it is\nseriously dry\ndry\nthe conditions here\nare serious\ni don't think they've had rain in a long\nthe air quality uh is like 200 and i\nthink if it's over 170 tomorrow they\nwon't let us race\nso there's that\nhanging in the balance hopefully we're\nable to race\n50 miles tomorrow i think is\nyou only have a time segment of\n4.5 miles up here\nand\nthe rest is uh\nriding you know higher on pace\ni'm not sure um\nno single truck tomorrow\nbut just good\ni think the time section is going to be\nsmooth i was talking to a pro here\nbut other than that should be a fun day\nday one was amazing\nhot it got hot it got windy\nthe single truck was serious\nbut we survived to ride another day",

Riders emphasize the critical importance of staying with a good group over this summit, as the following sections are fast rolling terrain where dropped riders face long chases. The 22-mile Copper Basin Loop presents rough, washboard roads that get hot and dusty, described as a sufferfest with rolling terrain. The final 10-mile return to Trail Creek is considered the most mentally challenging section, featuring straight roads with slight uphills and brutal headwinds. Course surfaces are rocky and bumpy throughout, with washboards from vehicle traffic, but riders report 32-35mm tires are sufficient. The event includes registration and expo areas in Ketchum, with aid stations available though early ones may be skippable."
