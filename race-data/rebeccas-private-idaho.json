The challenge comes from sustained climbing and distance more than bike handling skills."

The sustained nature of the climbing, combined with thin air, makes this genuinely difficult even for strong riders."

        "explanation": "Labor Day weekend in the Idaho mountains can swing from perfect conditions to cold rain or even early snow.

At elevation, weather changes fast and temperature swings are real, but it's not the brutal heat of desert races or guaranteed suffering of winter events."

        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Starting at nearly 6,000 feet in Ketchum and climbing to 7,900 feet over Trail Creek Summit puts serious altitude stress on sea-level riders. Much of the route stays in the 6,000-7,500 foot range, meaning you're breathing thin air for the entire ride. Riders traveling from lower elevations consistently report the altitude impact being worse than expected."

        "score": 5,
        "explanation": "This route drops you into legitimate wilderness through Copper Basin, where mechanicals or bonking become real problems miles from help. The combination of remote terrain, high altitude, and variable mountain weather creates genuine consequences for poor decisions. You're riding through country where cell service disappears and the next rider might be an hour behind you."
