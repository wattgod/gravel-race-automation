        "explanation": "Getting to Ketchum means flying into Sun Valley Airport or driving mountain roads from Boise.

Once you're there, the festival setup handles most needs, but you're dealing with resort town pricing and limited accommodation options during Labor Day weekend."

It's long enough to separate the weekend warriors from the real riders, especially when you add 6,200 feet of climbing at altitude. The distance forces pacing decisions early and punishes poor fueling choices later. Longer than Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

      "technicality": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "The route rolls over Trail Creek Summit and through Copper Basin on mostly gravel roads rather than true technical terrain. You're dealing with loose gravel, some washboard, and potentially muddy conditions, but this isn't rock garden navigation or steep singletrack. The challenge comes from sustained climbing and distance more than bike handling skills. Similar technical demands to Gravel Worlds. As Edyn Teitge puts it: \"I was pretty excited for the TT because one of my strong points is climbing... The climb was pretty steep and we gained over 1000 ft, but I was able to maintain a speed of around 10 mph.\""

      "elevation": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "6,200 feet of climbing over 103 miles means consistent grinding rather than explosive climbs. Trail Creek Summit hits 7,900 feet, then you descend into remote Copper Basin before more rolling elevation through the high country. The sustained nature of the climbing, combined with thin air, makes this difficult even for strong riders. More climbing than SBT GRVL at the same score. As Edyn Teitge puts it: \"I was pretty excited for the TT because one of my strong points is climbing... The climb was pretty steep and we gained over 1000 ft, but I was able to maintain a speed of around 10 mph.\""

Labor Day weekend in the Idaho mountains can swing from perfect conditions to cold rain or even early snow. The 2023 edition dealt with showers and fog that had riders questioning their gear choices. At elevation, weather changes fast and temperature swings are real, but it's not the brutal heat of desert races or guaranteed suffering of winter events. Similar climate challenges to SBT GRVL."

        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Starting at nearly 6,000 feet in Ketchum and climbing to 7,900 feet over Trail Creek Summit puts serious altitude stress on sea-level riders. Much of the route stays in the 6,000-7,500 foot range, meaning you're breathing thin air for the entire ride. Riders traveling from lower elevations consistently report the altitude impact being worse than expected. Higher altitude racing, comparable to SBT GRVL."

      "adventure": {
        "score": 5,
        "explanation": "This route drops you into wilderness through Copper Basin, where mechanicals or bonking become real problems miles from help. The combination of remote terrain, high altitude, and variable mountain weather creates consequences for poor decisions. You're riding through country where cell service disappears and the next rider might be an hour behind you.
