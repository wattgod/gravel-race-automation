Spring weather can be unpredictable but beats summer heat or winter misery. No historical weather disasters mentioned in the research. Similar climate challenges to SBT GRVL. As Carey Lowery puts it: \"Saturday's course was burly: 66 miles and 9200 feet. And with a good bit of chunky gravel/double track, my 2016 Niner RKT RDO with 2.2 Race Kings was the right bike for the gnar.\""

Less competitive depth than Almanzo 100. As Jon Livengood puts it: \"Managed to take 1st place in Masters and 5th overall for the race! And, as a podium bonus, we got podium HUGS!

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Registration runs $75-125. Reliance, Tennessee location means driving for most riders, though on-site camping controls lodging costs. Carey's equipment choices—mountain bike for Stage 1's chunk, gravel bike with 45mm tires for Stage 2—suggest gear-conscious riders might want multiple setups. Remote Cherokee National Forest setting limits nearby amenities and convenience options. Higher total cost than Badlands."
