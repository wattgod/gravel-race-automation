is where this event starts\nand ends there are several routes on\noffer including for those seeking big\nmiles a 200m option details of scratch\nankle are linked in the description\nbelow the next event enters its fifth\nyear of operation for 2025 and it is the\nfried clay 200k up in Eon Georgia AKA\nMiddle Georgia this event features\nroutes by the red clay ramble and the\nfried green 50 which I believe is no\nlonger in existence a shame for certain\nbut on top of that the event promoter\nPat adds his own Touch of craziness and\nwill challenge you with many many\ninteresting roads and tracks and all\nsorts of Madness should you decide to\nsign up for this excellent event I have\nridden this event personally and it\nroyally or is it presidentially either\nway it kicked my ass be

details of Piggy's Revenge\nLinked In the description below the next\nevent is based in Arkansas and I learned\ntoday that Arkansas is considered to be\npart of the southeast so that's news to\nme you learn something new every day\nthis event is pretty crazy because it\nfeatures three typ typ of Road Services\npavement single track and gravel and if\nI understand everything correctly you\ncan only use one bike to reverse all\nthose services this event is known as\nthe rule of three it is based out of\nBentonville Arkansas which in itself is\na cycling mea unfortunately I have not\nridden this event but it's on my list to\ndo you should consider doing it too you\ncan learn more details Linked In the\ndescription below another event and this\none's in the Arkansas o Oz arks it is\nknown as the Arkansas graler the Ozarks\nwere made quite Famous by a TV show not\ntoo long ago lovely spectacular scenery\neverywhere this event is new it was\nfounded in 2024 but it is worthy of

event\ncloser to the coast near Rocky Mount\nNorth Carolina and this is the Holly\nShelter gravel grinder there are several\ndistances on offer and whilst this might\nbe flatter this does doesn't mean

        "search_text": "The Reliance Tennessee gravel race features challenging terrain including dangerous bridge sections where crashes resulting in concussions and shoulder injuries have occurred. The course includes sustained climbs with 7% grades where riders slow to 7 miles per hour. Surface conditions can be hazardous, particularly tar sections that become slick when wet. The Web Brothers store serves as a key landmark and appears to be the only store in the area, making it an important logistical point. Riders are using Continental tubeless tires in 28mm widths for the varied terrain. The scenic route passes through beautiful areas that are popular with motorcycles and connects to areas like Cage Cove. The challenging nature of the course requires careful attention to technical descents and sustained climbing efforts."
