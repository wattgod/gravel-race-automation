The fact that they need to tell people not to park at the boat ramp tells you everything about the organizational sophistication."

The 'no flat roads, no champagne gravel' promise actually gets kept with routes up to 90% gravel."

        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Small-area camping is first-come first-served, which means you'll actually talk to the person next to your tent instead of hiding in some corporate hospitality village. SORBA Chattanooga benefits from the proceeds, so your entry fee supports trail advocacy instead of some promoter's yacht fund. The 'beautiful country, great crowd, good times' testimonial sounds authentically grassroots, not marketing department polish."

        "score": 2,

It's Tennessee gravel grinding for people who actually live within driving distance."

        "score": 3,

Combined weekend races total around 15,000 feet, which is legitimate volume for multi-day events. Recreational options from 24-50 miles give non-racers actual choices instead of token participation."

        "explanation": "Sunday's rocky descents require slowing down even on gravel bikes, and hardtails are recommended for the bumpier terrain. Routes in Cherokee National Forest aren't the groomed gravel highways you'll find in Kansas corn fields. Zero course marking means navigation skills are mandatory, not optional."

        "explanation": "8700 feet in 72 miles with named climbs like Buck Bald and Starr Mountain puts this in legitimate climbing territory. Combined weekend racing hits around 15,000 feet total, which separates the climbers from the sprinters. Even recreational routes pack 3000+ feet daily, so there's no hiding from vertical."

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "April in Tennessee can swing from perfect to biblical, and the research provides zero historical weather data to set expectations. No mention of typical conditions, mud years, or heat issues means you're gambling on Mother Nature's mood. Eastern Tennessee humidity plus spring weather volatility equals unpredictable suffering conditions."

      "altitude": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "This is Tennessee, not Colorado, so you're starting near sea level and climbing into hills, not mountains.

      "logistics": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Packet pickup details are completely absent from all documentation, which suggests either poor communication or last-minute scrambling.
