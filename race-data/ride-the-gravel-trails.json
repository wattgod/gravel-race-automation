Less climbing than The Mid South."

Minnesota weather creates planning challenges with seasonal swings. Equipment testing at '25psi starting pressure' by Jeff Barber shows conditions require standard gravel tire pressures, while mechanical issues highlight exposure risks during temperature variations. More weather exposure than Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

      "field_depth": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "With a field of 100-200 riders, zero documented finishers means zero field depth. Real Minnesota gravel races like the Almanzo or Dirty Benjamin pull competitive fields. This phantom event doesn't appear on any serious rider's calendar. Thinner field than Ouray Gravel Grinder."

          "description": "This ride is relatively short at about forty something miles, starting and ending in the small town of Hastings, Minnesota. Route design by JOM of Gravel Cyclist. The route meanders south along rural farm roads, taking in the Minnesota towns of Miesville and Welch along the way.\n\nDon't be fooled, this is a decently hilly area of Minnesota, and the riding is challenging, especially if a lot of wind is present. A stroke of luck, JOM and his partner LGC had a day of almost no wind along these lovely and scenic farm roads.\n\nParade Pace?\nWhat is Parade Pace? What happens during a Parade? The participants wave, and Parade Pace is no exception, no matter your riding speed, or number of photos taken during your ride :) Always wave to locals / local motorists you see along the way, and naturally, to any cyclists you may encounter. Remember, making friends with locals goes a long way to being a good steward for cycling.\n\nHastings, Minnesota:\n\"Hastings is a city mostly in Dakota County, Minnesota, of which it is the county seat, with a portion in Washington County, Minnesota. It is near the confluence of the Mississippi, Vermillion, and St. Croix Rivers. The advantages of Hastings's location that led to its original growth are that it is well-drained, provides a good riverboat port, and is close to a hydropower resource at the falls of the Vermillion River.\" - https://wikipedia.org\n\nMiesville, Minnesota:\n\"Miesville was founded in 1874 by John Mies, and named for him. A post office called Miesville was established in 1884, and remained in operation until 1903. John Mies built a saloon, restaurant and boarding house in Miesville in 1874. The building became a grocery store, saloon and post office in 1888 and became the Kings Restaurant in the 1980's.\"\n\nWelch, Minnesota:\n\"Welch is an unincorporated community in Welch Township, Goodhue County, Minnesota, United States. Welch is along County 7 Boulevard near Highway 61, 36 miles southeast of St. Paul. The Cannon River flows through the community. The Canyon Valley Trail (CVT), which runs from Cannon Falls to Red Wing, goes through the village.\"\n\nAdditional Minnesota gravel cycling fun can be seen at the MN Gravel Enthusiasts Facebook page - https://www.facebook.com/groups/1579219505656201\n\nChapters:\n0:00 Introduction\n0:14 Ride Experience Begins\n2:56 Parade Pace Explained\n3:43 Ride Experience Continues\n4:44 Tap Dancing on Gravel?\n5:10 Riding Along Again\n11:38 General Madness\n\nIn a similar vein, if you enjoy true grass roots gravel events at no cost to you, and you happen to be visiting or in North Florida, check out the long-standing North Florida Freeride Gravel Series, going into its 11th year of running in 2022.

The course runs through extensive farmland with soybean and corn fields, featuring numerous roller hills rather than flat terrain. Riders encounter diverse surface conditions including hard-packed clay, thicker gravel sections, and some loose areas along river roads. The route includes climbs that become steeper and more technical toward the end. Farm roads dominate the course with arrow-straight sections and plenty of rollers throughout. Riders should expect dust from farm equipment and school buses. The terrain varies from super hard-packed sections to areas with chatter on climbs. Multiple small towns dot the route including Welch Minnesota, with brief pavement sections between gravel segments."
