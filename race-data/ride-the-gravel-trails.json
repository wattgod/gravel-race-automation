      "value": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Dakota County offers excellent gravel trail access without race fees since no registration system exists. The area provides quality riding terrain at standard Minnesota costs without event markup."

      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Minneapolis metro proximity keeps lodging and travel costs reasonable. No race-specific fees documented, so expenses would be limited to standard travel costs like gas and potentially a hotel."
