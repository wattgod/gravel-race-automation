So, you\nguys are doing just shy of 40 km and\nuh at the there's a turnaround point.\nYou'll see some cones laid and then some\nsigns that show you that you turn on the\nheat station, you can replenish there.\nOr if you really are gunning for a good\ntime, you can just blast through and\nthen come back as fast as you can. 3 2\n1 And that's all riders.\nHave a safe ride,\nguys. Everyone's getting on the DLC.\nWoo!\nI didn't even recognize you, Carrie.\nYou're wearing black. I\nknow. Good morning everybody. So, the\nrace has started. Had technical\ndifficulties.

I hope you enjoy this video of the\nRiver\nCity Travel Race.\nOh, there's that beautiful springtime\nsmell in the air. It's the older leaves\npopping\nout and it's so pretty. What's that?\nRoad. Oh, Leah says they redid the road\nso it's smoother. Sounds nice.\nSo, we just made our first turn on a\ndifferent branch of the logging road\nnow. And yeah, so far so good. Nice and\nsmooth. Woo! Thank you,\n[Music]\nSomeone taking a picture for the races.\nSo, uh, very very dusty.\nMore\ndesk. Someone in the bush over there\ntaking\nbreak. It's the woman with the tassels.\nYou okay? Yep.\nOkay, we're really climbing\nnow. So hot. My glasses are out. I'm\ngetting condensation on them. I'm still\nholding on to the pack in front of me,\nthough. So, I'm not alone out here, so\nthat always feels\nnice. How are you doing? Doing good.\nWhat's your name? My name is Colin. Just\nout here for some fun. Yeah. Is this\ncalled pipe 2 fun? Yeah. Yeah,\ndefinitely feeling that today. And that\nright there is the Gold River Highway.\nYeah. I'm just talking to myself.\nI know. Yeah. I don't know. Hi. How are\nyou? I'm loving the hills.

We got some riders coming back now\ncuz it's a short courses and in-n-out.\nSo, we passed a couple riders, fast\nguys, uh fast guys, women, fast riders,\nuh coming this way now. So, I think\nwe're almost at the turnaround. Maybe\nabout four more kilometers or so. Yeah,\nit's been pretty good so far. Not too\nbad at\nall.\nWoohoo. And woo.

Looks\nlike there used to be a pier or\nsomething here. Look at\nthis. Oh, and the clouds are rolling in.\nAnd I felt a little\nspit. Oh, look at this. Hey.\nWoohoo. Oh, look at Leah. Are we going\nto stop or\nbanana? Did he say have a banana?\nI don't know.\nAre we going to stop and get pictures of\nthat? I want to understand that. Uh,\nwhat do you mean?

It's kind of weird\nthat they put a bike race on Easter.\nIt's kind of like putting a bike race on\nChristmas for some\npeople, but there's a amazing turnout\nanyways for it being on Easter.\nOkay, get together. Get it\ntogether. And we've got\ndust. Okay, now we got a big\nrain. Probably going to have to put my\nuh GoPro away cuz the micromod is not\nuh waterproof.

Kind of think we took the\nwrong turn.\nSo, oh well, it's up there\nanyways. How embarrassing. Oh no. Oh\ngosh, we did go the wrong way.\nBut or maybe they went the wrong way. I\ndon't know what's happening. But there's\nthe Easter color coats over there.\nHow was it? It was It was good. It\nwasn't too bad. Wasn't too bad at all.\nExcept did you get poured on out there?\nYes. Yeah. Okay. I did. Right at the\nend, but that's okay. It was at the end.\nThat was super fun. It was good.

The race offers three distance options: Experto Long Course, Intermedio, and Impulso. The Impulso short course covers just under 40km in an out-and-back format to a turnaround point. The course runs primarily on logging roads that have been recently redone and described as smooth, though they become very dusty during the event. Riders face significant climbing sections that cause glasses to fog up from exertion. The turnaround point is marked with cones and signs, featuring an aid station where riders can replenish supplies. Race registration includes lunch ticket, water bottle, and t-shirt. This second annual event has grown significantly in participation numbers and takes place on a beautiful non-rainy day with spring foliage."
