February delivers optimal early-season conditions in Bakersfield's hills, with webdev511 considering tire width based on rain chances: \"Might be tempted to go wider if it doesn't rain. Bakersfield can be pretty sandy, but it's not Fort Ord sandy.\" The race timing captures California's winter sweet spot before heat becomes a factor, though equipment choices still depend on precipitation.

Action Sports provides Friday bike shop services until 6:30pm for last-minute needs, while the venue includes food and beer during packet pickup and post-race festivities. Webdev511's tire choice considerations show riders can optimize equipment costs based on conditions, keeping expenses reasonable for the California location.

This is for riders who want their fitness tested by 30% run-ups, cattle dodging, and whatever Sam Ames dreamed up the night before. Your FTP matters less than your ability to laugh while hike-a-biking through a ball pit. Show up undertrained and the scree fields will humble you in ways Strava can't measure.",
