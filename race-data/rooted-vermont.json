Similar elevation profile to Gravel Worlds."

        "explanation": "FrankTuna prepared for \"upper 90s heat expected\" by planning \"4 water bottles and a gallon of sunscreen.\" Katie Kantzes enjoyed \"clear sunshine\" but other years have brought challenging conditions. Vermont summer heat combined with 9,000 feet of climbing creates serious hydration demands for August racing. More weather exposure than Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

Lower altitude than Gravel Worlds — no thin-air concerns."

        "score": 3,

No notable winners, no media coverage, no community buzz - just another dead Vermont gravel experiment."

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Race hasn't run since 2022 and left behind zero useful information about course details, aid stations, or actual logistics. It moved from Richmond to supposedly Morrisville and then disappeared entirely tells you everything about organizational consistency. Hard to rate quality when the event essentially doesn't exist anymore."

Former World Tour pro connection might have brought some ringers early on, but clearly not enough to sustain the event. Less competitive depth than Almanzo 100. As Ted King puts it: \"The vast majority is on this fast gravel, so if you were a really adept racer you might just get by on a road bike with really wide tyres – 34 slicks might be ok.\""

The festival atmosphere and community focus deliver substantial value beyond just the race itself."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Registration runs $60-100. Morrisville isn't a tourist trap, so lodging and food costs stay reasonable. Rural Vermont keeps things simple - no inflated resort pricing or big city premiums. Travel costs depend on where you're coming from, but at least you're not paying entry fees for a race that doesn't run. Similar expense level to Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."
