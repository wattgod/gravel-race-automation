Adam Roberge notes the \"relatively short course distance — 85 miles versus 100 or 200 — allows a lot more guys to be in the mix, so you need to go hard from the beginning.\" Elite winning times of 4:11-4:41 confirm it's substantial but manageable. Similar distance to Crusher in the Tushar."

Similar elevation profile to Gravel Worlds."

        "explanation": "FrankTuna prepared for \"upper 90s heat expected\" by planning \"4 water bottles and a gallon of sunscreen.\" Katie Kantzes enjoyed \"clear sunshine\" but other years have brought challenging conditions. Vermont summer heat combined with 9,000 feet of climbing creates serious hydration demands for August racing. More weather exposure than Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Morrisville sits around 900 feet above sea level - basically irrelevant for altitude considerations. Even Vermont's highest peaks barely crack 4000 feet, so you're never dealing with thin air or acclimatization issues. Pure sea-level lungs performance all day. Lower altitude than Gravel Worlds — no thin-air concerns."

      "adventure": {
        "score": 3,

No notable winners, no media coverage, no community buzz - just another dead Vermont gravel experiment."

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Race hasn't run since 2022 and left behind zero useful information about course details, aid stations, or actual logistics. It moved from Richmond to supposedly Morrisville and then disappeared entirely tells you everything about organizational consistency. Hard to rate quality when the event essentially doesn't exist anymore."

        "explanation": "The three-day gravel festival includes Friday night parties, Saturday expo with shakeout rides, and extensive post-race festivities. Matt Wilson, riding his first gravel race in honor of his sister Mo Wilson, said \"I cried and smiled more this weekend than ever before\" experiencing the Vermont gravel community."

Samantha Fox noted \"You can show up at Rooted and you know people, you aren't alone. There is no other race event where that is the case.\""

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "A defunct race in rural Vermont that never made it past year three isn't pulling serious talent. 309 total entries suggests decent participation but nothing approaching competitive depth. Former World Tour pro connection might have brought some ringers early on, but clearly not enough to sustain the event. Less competitive depth than Almanzo 100. As Ted King puts it: \"The vast majority is on this fast gravel, so if you were a really adept racer you might just get by on a road bike with really wide tyres – 34 slicks might be ok.\""

        "explanation": "Anurag Saxena described it as \"summer camp with a gravel race on the side\" with extensive weekend programming including free women's clinics, expo activities, and post-race meals. The festival atmosphere and community focus deliver substantial value beyond just the race itself."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Registration runs $60-100. Morrisville isn't a tourist trap, so lodging and food costs stay reasonable. Rural Vermont keeps things simple - no inflated resort pricing or big city premiums. Travel costs depend on where you're coming from, but at least you're not paying entry fees for a race that doesn't run. Similar expense level to Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

          "description": "Riding Vermont's Muddy Onion Gravel Bike Race Route: It's Iconic. It's, as we call it, a MUST RIDE, gravel cycling route. Its a well known fact that if you love to gravel cycle that Vermont is arguably the best place on earth to set a pair of tires on. With literally more gravel miles than paved, including highways, its no wonder there are gravel bike and bikepacking race events just about every week. The Muddy Onion is one of the more well known and revered races by locals and visitors. Leaving right from the states Capitol, Montpelier, you hit beautiful dirt, within only a few miles, riding through serene pastures and farmland. Every mile could be a postcard and the locals are friendly and happy to give you a wave when passing by.  I don't know of any other capitol, which feels more like a quaint small town than big city that can claim epic gravel riding just outside of its \"city\" limits. Welcome to Vermont its a beautiful place to be. The recent statewide historically damaging floods have put the entire state under water including Montpelier. Many businesses and homes were lost, millions of dollars and many years of repairs are needed to fix the damages. Our hearts go out to all those who endured any hardship as a result. \nMuch Love to all of you that tune in to this channel. I truly look forward to interacting with each and every one of you in the comments.\n#gravelbike #gravelcycling #gravelrace #gravelcyclingvermont #vermont #bikeadventures #dropbarmtb #cycling #gravelbikeroutes #cyclingrace",

a\nprofessional photographer lives in New\nHampshire we're going to do this in\nthree days two and a half so we're gonna\ndo a couple big days here uh we're\ngetting a gentleman's start at 10 30\nwhich was a little awkward but yeah\n[Music]\nall right\nBrett and I are\nno more than a half mile\ninto the ride\nand we are already on a\n500 foot\n12 great climb\nwelcome to Vermont\nforeign\nthis is Vermont gravel\nsomething like it\nlike an old washed out road\nhaving fun trying to descend\nthis thing\nbut we're about to just join up with a\nbeautiful Gravel Road and make our way\ndown to Lawson's Brewery for the first\nof many\nbeer stops on the Scrabble Loop let's go\nLincoln Gap near the top\nI uh met the boys Chris and Brett at the\nstart point I drove immediately to\nLincoln Gap because I'm kind of\nsupporting them in the van half\nsupporting half riding and I've got some\nwork to do I'm in the middle of my busy\nbusy season but I still wanted to get\nout and ride so this is one of the\nsteepest uh paved roads in America 24\nsustained greed so\ngonna ride back towards them see uh See\nif I can meet him it's\nSpringtime in Vermont Gordon\njust blow\nwell that's how hard\ndump truck needs to work to get up over\nthese Hills\ncertainly feels like we're working\nit's about as hard\nwe're in Waitsfield Vermont yeah we're\nlike 35 miles in in Brewery number one\nand are you excited at Jacob beer right\nnow\nI think I might have a few sips uh\nbecause we have like a 2 000 foot climb\nfive miles up the road so we're gonna\nkeep the drinking at a minimum and just\nenjoy the ambience\nwe're a beer deep\nnow on to the steepest paved Mile in the\ncountry\nall right just turned onto the Lincoln\nGap Road\nfour miles to the top the last two are\nuh\n24 sustained steepest paved Road\nin the United States supposedly\nclimb's almost 2 000 feet from the river\nvalley\nand it's gonna be heinous\nwhat do you think's gonna be harder\nMauna Kea or this\nI think Mauna Kea probably because we're\nat like 2000 feet and there's lots of\noxygen\nMauna Kea was fourteen thousand\nbut it wasn't 24 it was not 24 percent\nthis is true\nit doesn't get any\neasier from here\nI've never seen red so dark\non this climb profile\ncasual 16 grade\njust slow enough for the mosquitoes to\nbite\nnice added\na bit of adversity\nboy that's steep\njust for the record Lincoln God\nis harder than Montana\noh mosquito under my eyeglasses\n25 grade\noh boy\nI've got the seat section coming up 27\npercent grade\nthat is outrageous\n16 grade fuels\nflat\nyeah boys\n[Applause]\nI'm back in the van\ngot to the top of Lincoln Gap and I am\nLeapFrog and the boys looking for cool\nplaces to shoot\nmore moral support and the lights\ngetting good\nthat golden

we've done some\nroom planning and getting started for\nthe day\nwe decided we don't want to tackle the\nurban nightmare that it's Burlington\nVermont and why and what's the reason\nfor that uh all the breweries will be\nclosed when we go through yeah there's\nno beer to drink there's no beer to\ndrink at 9 00 a.m in Burlington Vermont\napparently um\nthe mantras like to drink their beer\nafter 11 A.M I honestly thought they\nstart at 8am yeah I mean that was my\nmistake so we uh\nwe changed up the route Chris changed up\nthe route this morning so instead of\ngoing over to Burlington we're going to\ngo over a couple more gaps that were not\nincluded in the original route app Gap\nfood Mad River Glen and uh more\nMountains less City\nyeah looking forward to it we're gonna\nget to Stowe is the first big wheel stop\nthere's gonna be a couple breweries\nthere that should be open two actually\nin the same in the same town and then\njust a few more miles\nfrom there there's Morristown and\nthere's two more breweries that will\nalso be open so we might end up drinking\nfour different types of beers within a\nhour or two span which could be a little\ninteresting today\nso that's why we came here to ride bikes\nand taste some Vermont Brew\nright Brett it's cracked\nsee the good stuff\nno dude\nI just have to walk around them\nthat is\nhe's like the young two-year-old that'll\njust

While there are pros who line up to compete for top honors, it's a different story for the majority of the field behind. This video takes you inside that field as Phil and Steve ride close to 60 miles of gravel and class IV roads while climbing 7,500 feet. Along the way, they have adventures, mechanical failures and yard sales, as well as meet lots of friends, new and old.\n\nMeet the Drowned Caterpillar; say hey to the volunteer crew from @rasputitsaspringclassic8395; have a snack under the Pure Vermont Gravel tent or at the Class 4 Designs pancake stop; meet the locals who know the one true line; draft a stinky trailer; power up at a forest pool; throw a yard sale; and fix a seat post about a hundred times: all this and more awaits you in this journey through the 2022 Vermont Overland.\n\nProducers' note: All of the footage for this video was shot before either of us learned about the tragic loss of Sule Kangangi, professional rider for @AMANIProject and friend and colleague to many in the gravel community. We gave a lot of consideration to what to do with our footage after such a terrible shock. Ultimately we decided that since the story we tell here is true to our experience at the time, and was created in the pursuit of spreading love for gravel cycling, it would serve as a small way to honor Sule's memory and the goals he strived for.\n\nFeatured in this video:\n@ovrlnd \nSuleiman \"Sule\" Kangangi - @AMANIProject \nAscutney Outdoors - https://www.ascutneyoutdoors.org/\n@rasputitsaspringclassic8395 - https://rasputitsadirt.com/\nPure Vermont Gravel - https://www.purevermontgravel.com/\nClass 4 Designs - https://www.class4designs.com/\n\nChapters\n00:00 - In Memory of Sule\n00:21 - Meet the Drowned Caterpillar\n01:42 - Titles\n02:54 - Strategic Planning\n05:32 - First Gravel\n07:12 - More Cowbell! & Class IV Mayhem\n10:24 - Lost Phil\n13:19 - Found Phil\n15:00 - First Aid Station\n17:36 - More Mayhem\n20:00 - Locals Know the Line\n21:41 - Additional Mayhem\n23:46 - Second Aid Station\n24:53 - Draft Animals\n25:41 - Yard Sale! & The Pool of Power\n29:13 - Running Up That Hill\n32:02 - Never Tell Me the Elevation\n32:54 - Third Aid Station\n34:19 - The Final Approach\n36:01 - Finishing Chute\n36:36 - Food!

rider\n[Music]\ndo you remember how wrecked i was yeah\nso you're gonna be less than half of\nthat\nhi me\nuh what was the question how do i feel\nsomeone had recently asked me he said i\nfelt like i've been hit by a car and she\nsaid have you been hit by a car before\nand i said yeah i actually have and this\nfeels much worse\nthanks\nit's a non-stop inventory and it'll\ndrive you crazy\nall right\nso\nsometime in 2020\nwhen people are doing ever ridiculously\nlonger and longer rides amid a pandemic\nwe have\nthe mad genius miguel crawford who says\ni can do something even bigger than that\nhe said i've created the mega hopper we\ngot a thousand feet of climbing per 10\nmiles 430 miles 43 000 feet of climbing\nwhat is the grasshopper adventure series\nuh\nit is the\nog of gravel my first experience was\n2008 i want to say they're they're so\nwell known in northern california and\nand just the history and heritage is\nsomething that has been really really\nspecial to be part of over the years my\nname is miguel crawford i wear a couple\ndifferent hats i teach high school\nspanish i've been teaching for 26 years\nas a teacher i've always had the summers\nand my vacations to go on adventures and\ni just love connecting things and it\nfeels like an artistic endeavor has over\nyears of putting these together and so\nit wasn't simple to think how could we\nconnect all these together where you're\nnot doing loops and i sat down and\nplaying around with where i linked nine\nof the grasshoppers together and so i\nthink i've put 17 different routes\ntogether over the 24 years for the\ngrasshopper all just within northern\ncalifornia\nwe are going to see an absolute bit of\neverything that the area has to offer i\nmean my goal is just to have\nfun over a\nvery long and painful 430 miles\nman i'm like more nervous now than\nbefore the start of here\ni'm gonna go to\nthere you're bed gonna drive\njust start riding bikes\nhere we are 5 45 a.m we are at the mill\ndistrict typically this place is super\nlively because whenever i'm here i'm\nhosting events and really showcasing\nwhat healdsburg\nand the surrounding area is all about\nthat's the whole purpose of this project\nis to show\nshow the landscape show the variety show\nthe adventure that you can have around\nhere and that's why i'm up at 5 45 a.m\nto go for this bike ride\nlet's do it\nit was a perfect start to the day to\nroll out of here and then within a\nhandful of miles already meeting up with\nmiguel i mean he's without question the\ngenesis of this event\nso sun's coming up and\nyou know we're a handful of moments\nwe're just tourists\nyou know there are roads that he's\nwritten\ncountless times that i've written dozens\nof times and we're stopping just being\nlike\nthat is a magnificent landscape as we're\nriding he's talking about\nland that he lived post-college\nearly on in the course and why that's\nimportant to him\nrolling out of wine country here in\nheelsburg\ngoing up over deep into the redwoods\nbeautiful climb\npine flat going out to the coast you\nhave the the absolute landscape of the\nwest coast right there it's it's\nmagnificent first real gravel\nwe're at the watering hole in casadaro\nthis is a famous spot\ni mean chaz came out and\nrode willow creek down coleman valley\nhe's a hoot you obviously get his energy\njust by being within proximity of them\nnow here we are at top of coleman valley\ni'm chaz christensen i live in the bay\narea we are up in northern california in\ngrasshopper territory and this is where\ni got my introduction to gravel and\nadventure writing 10 years ago if you're\nnot prepared this is some of the\ngnarliest riding i think in all of\ncalifornia so doing this route in one go\nthe mega hopper 430 miles 43 000 feet of\nclimbing is gnarly there's a lot of good\naid stations by that i mean bakeries\nthis is a definitely a hefty thing to do\nin one go i would do this\non a four day bike packer and i would\ncamp up on the ridgelines and i would go\neat a hot bakery breakfast every morning\nand i'd probably take four to five days\nso the fact that ted's gonna do it in\nprobably less than 48 hours is uh\nit's a feat kudos to him i'm gonna ride\ndown this hill and then go to the bakery\nand get it\n[Applause]\ncoleman's a roller coaster i'm gonna\nhead this way he's gonna head that way\nall right four and a half riding hours\naveraging 262 watts\nthree and a half more centuries to go\nokay what's my rig\ncannondale super six evo se\nwhich is my gravel bike of choice\nmassive clearance\n700 by 48 c tires in there\nzip 303 fire crest i'm running it mullet\nso i got eagle out back i got a 46\nfront tooth chainring a 1050 rear so i\nmean that is the perfect range for me\napproximately halfway through today day\none we are ahead of average we are well\nover ten thousand feet of climbing the\nnext hundred miles are going to be a\ndoozy but one pedal stroke at a time and\nwe'll make it happen\nand we are going up mount vision\nthis is a vision quest\ncoming out of point reyes do mount\nvision perfect name for the for the\nclimb because you got vision you got a\nview 360 degrees beautiful view from up\nthere\nvision quest\ncomplete\ntop of mount vision that was a\nridiculous three mile climb now i'm\nabout to drop in on some single track\nall the way down see ya\nzip back down to the coast\nand\ninstead of taking the traditional\nhighway one\nmiguel had us bang a right turn and go\nup on a lima valley trail\nsingle track galore\nthose are the kind of trails that are\nperfect for a gravel bike\ni also rode with my\nreally really good friend i mean best\nfriend\ntony little who came out\nmount tam\ni think one thing that makes it really\nspecial is how isolated you can be so\nquickly you've got complete peace and\nquiet tranquility and it's just this\nbeautiful\npiece of san francisco culture mountain\nmolina's rich\ncommence\nsalinas fairfax done\nlet the rubber meet the road we call\nthat soul work do we not and it's free\nfeel free to pedal that one all the way\nthrough\n165 miles and\n18 000 feet of climbing\nbut that is a ferocious ratio\nthe goal in day one was to cover the 205\nmiles and get to occidental because i\nknew upon arrival i'd have a place to\nstay\nand you know gather\na little bit of recuperation for what\nwas going to be in store the next day\nwe're just on our way back from dinner\nand uh\nwhat what was the time i think it's like\n13 pedaling hours 14 pedaling hours\nwhat kind of money do i need to go get\non my bike and go ride 205 miles\nright now\ni don't think money i think i need sleep\nmore than any money right now\nbut i think i'm completely empty knowing\nthey're gonna be able to rest and\nrecharge a little bit before tomorrow\nthis is ted\nsigning off\nand very close to going to bed\nhere we are\nrock on\nit's been now a half dozen years in\nretirement and it's taking on new and\ndifferent things exactly a year ago i\nwas getting ready for the arkansas high\ncountry race that was my first bike\npacking trip that was a thousand miles\nself-supported all over arkansas and so\nthe the mega hoppers it's taken a page\nout of that 430 miles is a considerable\nportion\nof the biggest ride that i've ever done\nit's that element of unknown that just\nis exciting and daunting and terrifying\nand fun all the same time that was\nold casadero\nit's\nnow about to start king ridge\none thing that i really loved about this\nride is i'm riding them\ni'm riding these iconic routes at\ntotally different times of day so to be\nat the top of king ridge at dawn and so\nto see the sunrise was just\nthat's the kind of stuff that makes you\nfeel special on a bike\nyeah i can't help but think of\nmeeting my wife on king ridge\nfor\neasy and obvious reasons but that one is\nspecial among them all\nking ridge\nturn right\ntin barn\nskaggs\nand then a screaming descent\nwhich brings us here to the gate\nto lake sonoma single track\nlake sonoma\ni\ngot off my bike\n40 times i mean i\ncertainly\nstopped trying to count after it was\ntaking place every\nlesson learned if you're gonna ride your\ngravel bike here be gosh darn cherry you\nhave good walking shoes\ncalifornia is a place that i have called\nhome\num obviously living now on the other\nside of the country it's it's it's funny\nto have these sort of two places to feel\nso connected sonoma\nin particular is a place that is is\nintegral in my cycling career it's the\nfirst place i came when i signed my pro\ncontract within the first two weeks of\nmoving to california i was doing my\nfirst hopper i won my first opera there\nplank coffee in cloverdale\nyou know i look back on day two\nthe first part was certainly\ncharacterized by moving really slowly\nand trying to be at peace with the\nfrustration of not moving as quickly as\ni'd like my name is matthew accorino i'm\na chef most of the time cyclist most of\nthe time but i'm here today riding with\nted finishing the second half of his\nepic two-day adventure that he's on but\ni'm a bit of an adventurer myself so i'm\nalways\nup for a good long ride\nsonoma's got\ngreat\nroads if you're riding road bikes you\nknow what happens is\nall these rural communities out here\nthey start building houses and because\nthey build houses then all these little\nfingers of roads go out into places so\nat some point somebody says okay here's\na road goes to here now it's dirt then\nit connects to the other side and then\nit becomes pavement again and so it's\nall this mixed terrain riding\nit's a lot of fun uh it's off the beaten\npath and it's kind of endless and i\nthink for all those reasons\nyou can uh\nhave quite an adventure out here\ni have so much confidence in him because\nwhen he told me he wanted to do this\nride it's like 400 and whatever 30 miles\nwalk in the park for you you've done a\nthousand miles in arkansas you know this\nis just like what he loves to do\nsometimes\nit's a lot easier to sit and watch the\ndot though than it actually is to do the\nride so i forget that like oh this is\nactually a really challenging feat and\nnow seeing him like okay yeah he's\nhe's human he's tired\nthe second part of day two\nin one word is heat\nit was it was stifling\nwe're gonna turn right and then start to\nclimb proper\nit's it's funny meeting up with some\nfolks who have fresh legs because that's\ngonna that's gonna push the pace a\nlittle bit at that point you're just\ntrying to do the final 25 which is a\nequally cruel burn\ni was looking at that ride as as over\nthe course of two 100 mile plus rides\nthose first 100 miles\nfelt like riding my bike threw quicksand\ninto a headwind uphill both ways in a\nsnowstorm\nfrom geysers all the way down\nto the base of spring mountain where you\nfinally get back to civilization\ngetting up over ida clayton same deal i\nmean it's it's big flat hot exposed and\nadequate and has the added benefit of\nbeing foolishly steep\ni'm just reminding myself why i don't\nride ida clayton very often because that\nwas penis\ntwo significant climbs to go\nand hopefully downhill and tailwind\neverywhere else\nit was really nice having\nmiddletown on the other side and knowing\nthere is a heck of a lot of hydration to\nbe had i think i drank\nuh at least three bottles\nsoda\ndrink mix\nmatt has certainly had no expectation\ninto riding into\nthe dark\nso therefore he didn't bring lights in\norder to bring warm clothes conveniently\nthat's a good example of\nover packing just the tiniest bit so i\nhad a vest that we could wear\ni know laura's got some pizza ordered up\nso that sounds pretty dreamy i don't\nknow why we're going home\ni think we should just start over\nand then we became a train because i was\non the front with my headlamp and he\njust had to follow the wheel in front of\nhim\nwhat i love about an adventure like this\nis it's\nit's something that anybody really can\ntake on i mean obviously i'm doing it\nwith this\nfoolish ambition of doing it as quickly\nas possible\nbut this is feasible to drop in and do\ndo sections at a time\nmega hopper\nthat's a wrap\nthis the mega hopper to me represents\nyou know this this really fast growing\nfacet of bike packing\nand it's it's it's almost like i want to\ni want to put this on the map for bike\npackers for people to recognize that you\ncan do so much in this area i want\npeople to see this as a carrot for them\nto chase down for them to go do for them\nto\npursue\n27 hours over the course of\na day and a half\nthat's enough to make me tired\nto all a good night\nspending time in healdsburg while we\nlived in california and now from the\nother side of the country\nit has been entirely about the mill\ndistrict and our goal here\nis to draw people to\nhealedsburg and ride bikes and\nand be part of this growing community of\ncycling\nthat has been the goal from day one\nworking with the mill district and\nexperience the the town i mean there's\nphenomenal restaurants there are\namazing breweries there are world-class\nwineries here\nit's a\nit's a it's a lucky job when\nyou're told create cycling community in\na place and try to draw people here and\nthat's\nthat is the goal that laura and i in the\nmiddle district share\nhey if you like this video please hit\nthe like button down below share it let\npeople know about it if you have\nquestions about the mega hopper or any\nof the hoppers in general just drop a\nlittle comment down below as well i got\nlinks down there to check them all out\nthat's what i got",
