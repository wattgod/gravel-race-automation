      },
      "length": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "55 miles hits that middle distance sweet spot for grassroots racing where, as promoter Jason notes, riders line up 'against your buddies, talking smack that you may or may not be able to back up.' Long enough to matter, short enough for weekend warriors. More compact than Grinduro."
      },
      "technicality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "2000 feet over 55 miles suggests rolling Georgia terrain rather than technical challenges. No course details available beyond basic elevation data, indicating moderate gravel roads typical of the region. Less technical than The Mid South."
      },
      "elevation": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "2000 feet over 55 miles averages roughly 36 feet per mile—gentle rolling hills by any climbing standard. Your local highway overpass probably delivers more vertical punch than this Georgia countryside route. Flatter profile than Croatan Buck Fifty."
      },
      "climate": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Historical weather data shows average highs of 75°F and lows of 55°F, with a 41% chance of rain on any given day. Late March in south Georgia should dodge summer humidity, but spring weather remains unpredictable. No historical weather incidents documented, suggesting either stable conditions or limited race history to draw from. More weather exposure than Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

      "altitude": {
        "score": 1,

      "adventure": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "The biggest adventure was whether the race would happen—it didn't in 2025. Georgia backroads offer rural charm, but with zero course feature information available, the adventure level remains theoretical."
      },
      "prestige": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Chainbuster Racing's Jason emphasizes grassroots philosophy where 'the hug or fist bump at the end means more than any medal ever could.' This is small-town racing focused on community over competition accolades."
      },
      "race_quality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Race quality centers on what Jason calls 'the joy of community and camaraderie' rather than polished production values. Promoter warns that without community support, only 'expensive, impersonal corporate experiences' will survive."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "The experience reflects grassroots racing at its core—lining up with locals for friendly competition in small-town Georgia. March timing should provide decent riding weather, assuming the event actually runs."
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Chainbuster Racing cancelled the event due to 18 registrants, with promoter Jason citing market saturation as the third event in the same area in three months. His philosophy centers on lining up against your buddies, talking smack, and letting camaraderie rule the day, but the numbers tell the story of a grassroots race that could not sustain participation against competing local events."
      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Just 18 registrants led to the 2025 cancellation, revealing the challenge of building competitive fields in saturated markets. No notable past winners or competitive depth documented. Thinner field than Ouray Gravel Grinder."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Jason notes that 'no one is getting rich or retiring off race revenue' while costs hit all-time highs. This suggests reasonable pricing focused on covering expenses rather than profit maximization."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Registration runs $65-85. Small-town Georgia keeps lodging and travel costs manageable compared to destination races. The promoter's emphasis on grassroots accessibility suggests the overall expense burden remains reasonable for participants. Similar expense level to Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."
