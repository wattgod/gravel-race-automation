      "length": {
        "score": 5,
        "explanation": "The 300-mile distance across Emporia's roads creates sustained suffering over mixed terrain. Team racing option allows groups of three to tackle the distance together, departing in time trial intervals. Chasteen notes the team format \"creates a lower barrier of intimidation\" for riders too intimidated to attempt 100+ miles solo. Among the longest in gravel, comparable to Badlands."
      },
      "technicality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Andy Chasteen describes the singletrack as \"not super techy, it's pretty smooth, fast, and flowy, but very climby.\" The course breaks down to 30 miles pavement, 50 miles gravel, 20 miles singletrack. Technical challenge comes from surface transitions rather than features—riders debate hardtail versus gravel setups for optimal speed. Less technical than The Mid South."
      },
      "elevation": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "The 15,000 feet over 300 miles creates relentless climbing rather than dramatic peaks. Chasteen notes the singletrack sections are \"very climby\" with the kind that leaves \"your mouth hurting because you've been smiling the whole time.\" The elevation accumulates steadily across all three surface types. More climbing than SBT GRVL at the same score."
      },
      "climate": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Historical weather data shows average highs of 83°F and lows of 63°F, with a 23% chance of rain on any given day. Weather varies dramatically from year to year across the extended distance. The 300-mile format means experiencing whatever conditions develop over the full day and potentially into night. Kansas spring weather can shift from rain to heat over the long hours required to complete the course. Milder conditions than Crusher in the Tushar."
      },
      "altitude": {
        "score": 1,

      },
      "adventure": {
        "score": 5,
        "explanation": "Andy Chasteen's multi-surface concept emerged while testing bikes in Bentonville: \"on this bike we could ride singletrack, gravel, and road all day long.\" The race starts and ends at Coler Mountain Bike Preserve with \"flowy jump lines and techy rock sections,\" potentially \"finishing on the dual slalom course.\""
      },
      "prestige": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Chasteen draws inspiration from Burning Man culture: \"It's very Burning Man-esque with costumes and quirky weirdness.\" The event includes oddball categories like \"Most selfies with roadkill\" with Enve wheels as prizes. Philosophy remains \"This event will never be about making a living, it will always about making a cool event.\""
      },
      "race_quality": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Self-supported format with unmarked courses creates pure adventure racing conditions. Chasteen keeps entry fees at $60-65 and requires sponsors to \"come and do something that creates value for the people at the event\" rather than just providing cash. Quality depends entirely on rider preparation and navigation skills."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "The multi-surface format delivers unique variety requiring equipment strategy and surface adaptation. Chasteen's Burning Man influence shows in costumes and quirky categories. The event emphasizes community participation through team options and post-race gathering at the preserve with its technical mountain bike features."
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Chasteen puts major decisions to Facebook votes, creating \"buy-in for people who come to your event.\" The philosophy centers on \"fewer dollars, more community\" with sponsors required to add value through experiences rather than cash. Team format encourages group participation and shared suffering across the distance."
      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "With a field of ~100 riders (ultra distance, limited field), team format creates accessibility for riders intimidated by solo ultra-distance racing. Chasteen notes teams departing in time trial style after solo racers, with checkpoint requirements keeping groups together. The quirky categories and Burning Man atmosphere attract participants focused on experience over pure competition. Similar competitive depth to The Rift."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Entry fees kept deliberately low at $60-65 range according to Chasteen's community-first philosophy. Sponsors provide experiential value like after-parties rather than cash prizes. The 30+ pound bike category and roadkill selfie contests with quality prizes like Enve wheels add entertainment value beyond pure racing."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Registration runs $200-$250. Andy Chasteen warns about tire durability: \"The rock is sharp, too, so you're gonna have to run durable tires or you're gonna slash a sidewall.\" Equipment strategy varies significantly—\"A hardtail rigid mountain bike on 2.0 tires might win this. Or an Able with 650b wheels and 50mm tires.\" Similar expense level to Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

You need legitimate endurance fitness—300 miles doesn't negotiate, and the self-supported nature means your mistakes compound quickly. Come prepared for mental warfare disguised as a bike race.",
      "alternatives": "Unbound 200 gives you the same roads with aid stations and more prestige, while Mid South offers similar distance with better terrain variety and actual community vibe.
