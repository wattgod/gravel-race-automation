      "length": {
        "score": 5,
        "explanation": "The 300-mile distance across Emporia's roads creates sustained suffering over mixed terrain. Team racing option allows groups of three to tackle the distance together, departing in time trial intervals. Chasteen notes the team format \"creates a lower barrier of intimidation\" for riders too intimidated to attempt 100+ miles solo. Among the longest in gravel, comparable to Badlands."
      },
      "technicality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Andy Chasteen describes the singletrack as \"not super techy, it's pretty smooth, fast, and flowy, but very climby.\" The course breaks down to 30 miles pavement, 50 miles gravel, 20 miles singletrack. Technical challenge comes from surface transitions rather than features—riders debate hardtail versus gravel setups for optimal speed. Less technical than The Mid South."
      },
      "elevation": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "The 15,000 feet over 300 miles creates relentless climbing rather than dramatic peaks. Chasteen notes the singletrack sections are \"very climby\" with the kind that leaves \"your mouth hurting because you've been smiling the whole time.\" The elevation accumulates steadily across all three surface types. More climbing than SBT GRVL at the same score."
      },
      "climate": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Historical weather data shows average highs of 83°F and lows of 63°F, with a 23% chance of rain on any given day. Weather varies dramatically from year to year across the extended distance. The 300-mile format means experiencing whatever conditions develop over the full day and potentially into night. Kansas spring weather can shift from rain to heat over the long hours required to complete the course. Milder conditions than Crusher in the Tushar."
      },
      "altitude": {
        "score": 1,

      },
      "adventure": {
        "score": 5,
        "explanation": "Andy Chasteen's multi-surface concept emerged while testing bikes in Bentonville: \"on this bike we could ride singletrack, gravel, and road all day long.\" The race starts and ends at Coler Mountain Bike Preserve with \"flowy jump lines and techy rock sections,\" potentially \"finishing on the dual slalom course.\""
      },
      "prestige": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Chasteen draws inspiration from Burning Man culture: \"It's very Burning Man-esque with costumes and quirky weirdness.\" The event includes oddball categories like \"Most selfies with roadkill\" with Enve wheels as prizes. Philosophy remains \"This event will never be about making a living, it will always about making a cool event.\""
      },
      "race_quality": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Self-supported format with unmarked courses creates pure adventure racing conditions. Chasteen keeps entry fees at $60-65 and requires sponsors to \"come and do something that creates value for the people at the event\" rather than just providing cash. Quality depends entirely on rider preparation and navigation skills."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "The multi-surface format delivers unique variety requiring equipment strategy and surface adaptation. Chasteen's Burning Man influence shows in costumes and quirky categories. The event emphasizes community participation through team options and post-race gathering at the preserve with its technical mountain bike features."
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Chasteen puts major decisions to Facebook votes, creating \"buy-in for people who come to your event.\" The philosophy centers on \"fewer dollars, more community\" with sponsors required to add value through experiences rather than cash. Team format encourages group participation and shared suffering across the distance."
      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "With a field of ~100 riders (ultra distance, limited field), team format creates accessibility for riders intimidated by solo ultra-distance racing. Chasteen notes teams departing in time trial style after solo racers, with checkpoint requirements keeping groups together. The quirky categories and Burning Man atmosphere attract participants focused on experience over pure competition. Similar competitive depth to The Rift."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Entry fees kept deliberately low at $60-65 range according to Chasteen's community-first philosophy. Sponsors provide experiential value like after-parties rather than cash prizes. The 30+ pound bike category and roadkill selfie contests with quality prizes like Enve wheels add entertainment value beyond pure racing."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Registration runs $200-$250. Andy Chasteen warns about tire durability: \"The rock is sharp, too, so you're gonna have to run durable tires or you're gonna slash a sidewall.\" Equipment strategy varies significantly—\"A hardtail rigid mountain bike on 2.0 tires might win this. Or an Able with 650b wheels and 50mm tires.\" Similar expense level to Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

You need legitimate endurance fitness—300 miles doesn't negotiate, and the self-supported nature means your mistakes compound quickly. Come prepared for mental warfare disguised as a bike race.",
      "alternatives": "Unbound 200 gives you the same roads with aid stations and more prestige, while Mid South offers similar distance with better terrain variety and actual community vibe.

          "transcript": "Hello viewers. So I've just survived my\nfirst ever UCI gravel event just about\nit was a close call at times but I got\naround in mostly one piece and I\ndefinitely learned a few lessons and\nmade some mistakes along the way which\nI'll share in today's video. And also\nwe're here for some actual pros and more\nexperienced gravel cyclists about the\ntips and wisdom they can share with us\nall today which is especially important\nif you are doing your first ever gravel\nrace event or sportive. Better to learn\nfrom other people's mistakes than make\nthem yourself. So before we hear from\nthe pros, let me share my experience\nfrom riding the GRIC in Scotland at the\nweekend and the mistakes I made and the\ntips I would share with you based on my\nexperience. The first one is don't start\ntoo fast. I made the mistake of getting\ncaught up in the race for the first\ncorner, the first climb, and going way\nharder than I had planned. I'm a I'm a\nsucker for getting carried away at the\nstart of a race. And it was made\nespecially tough because we weren't able\nto warm up before the race. So going\nfrom standill to full gas in a matter of\nseconds was very tough on my old body.\nSo I would recommend a warm up before\nthe race or event if you can which\nwasn't available at the gratic because\nwe had to line up in our age pens about\n45 minutes before the start. So we stood\naround for ages with cold legs. So that\nmade it really tough. So given that cold\nstart, I would should have gone for a\nslightly more relaxed start. But I know\nthe importance of getting a good start,\nnot getting held up in traffic in the\nsort of pinch points through town and\ninto the first climb. And my aim was to\nget a good start and then provide some\nsliding space on the first climb, which\nI definitely did slide. I slid a long\nway back on that first climb as my my\nbody was screaming at me, my heart rate\nthrough the roof, and my glutes were\nshouting at me very loudly because of\nwhat I was asking from them from a cold\nstart. So unless you're racing to win,\nwhich I wasn't, and you are just racing\nto finish, maybe don't be so caught up\nin the start line pandemonium and ride\nto your own heart rate. Right to power\nif you have a power meter on your bike\nand try and pace yourself better than I\ndid on the first climb. I have a big\nmistake, the biggest one I regret is\ngoing higher on the tire pressures than\nI would normally do. I was freaked out\nby people punchering on the recon and my\nown experience of the recon and\nrealizing the gravel in Scotland in this\narea of Scotland is way tougher and way\nharder than anywhere I experienced in my\nlife. So to minimize the risk of\npunching even running tubeless because\neven with no inner tube to pinch with\ntubeless you can still pinch the tire\nsidewalls between a rock and a rim and\nit's also damaging the rims to be\nconscious about as well. So I went\nhigher on the tire pressures to minimize\nthe risk of a failure. But in doing so,\nI minimized the amount the tire can\ndeform on a rough ground and minimize\nhow much suspension I effectively had.\nAnd my arms just couldn't cope with the\nrelentless pounding over 4 hours of\nracing. So I should have stuck to my\nguns. as stuck to low pressures I know\nwork for me and relied on my faith in my\nequipment choices on the day and not be\ndeterred by what's happening around me\non the the day before the race. Those\nthen are the mistakes I made and the\ntips I take away from my first ever UCI\ngravel race. But now, let's hear from\nsome actual gravel pros who did much\nbetter in a race than I did and some\nmuch more experienced and seasoned\ngravel riders about the tips and wisdom\nthey can share with us in today's video.\nI would definitely say make sure to take\ncare of your equipment in this race\nespecially cuz it it's pretty rocky.\nIt's pretty chunky out there and a lot\nof people's races ended last year like\nmine last year ended just with like a a\nbig hit and I just was using wheels that\nweren't strong enough. Um so you broke\nyour wheels. I broke my front wheel.\nOkay. So, I kind of had to limp home the\nlast 15k or so and my race is done. Like\nI just stopped thinking I had a flat and\nI stopped and sealant was coming through\nthe rim. Uh so, so that was a pretty\nthat was pretty bad. But yeah, I would\nsay yeah, have your uh equipment dialed\nand when in doubt or there's a a classic\nsaying in Canada at least like it's\nbetter to be looking at it than looking\nfor it. So, it's better to have in this\nrace like a bit wider tires, having foam\ninserts, a little bit lower pressure\njust because yesterday if you're like\nwith road you're everyone's nickeling\nand dimming like oh I got I have to have\nthese aeros socks I have to have this\nhelmet's faster than this helmet where\ngravel it's like well we're going to\naverage 30 odd tomorrow and it's half up\nhalf down and like the aerodynamics on a\ndownhill are less important and uphill\nyou're going 20k an hour and it's it's\nbetter just to have maybe a couple more\nwatts here and there but have like a\nreally a bike you can trust\nI think is really key. And then for\nnutrition, it's just keep getting it in.\nI'm going to use the uh Castelli has\nlike a a hydro pack for the back. So\nlast year there was bottles being\njettisoned all over the course on some\nof the rockier downhills. So I just have\nthe hydro bag. So I'm like, \"Okay, got\nthe foam inserts. I got the wide tires.\nMy all the liquid I need is on my back.\nSo if I lose a bottle, it's like, okay,\nI have enough water, the bare minimum on\nmy back to get me through the whole\nrace.\" Um especially because Grow\nit's very nature conscious and they\ndon't want people driving all over in\nthe national park here.\nUm it's it's good to just make sure you\nhave the stuff you need at the start.\nHave a bike you can trust and not like\nnot risk it cuz it's a it's a long lot a\nlong way to come up here to Scotland and\nrun too narrow of tires or road pedals\nor something where it's like oh that\nbroke my race is done. My day is done.\nSo that would be my advice is\nplay it safe. for food and for\nequipment. We're here at the Grow. Yes.\nWhat one bit of advice would you give to\nsomebody doing their first gravel event,\nwhether racing or just riding for fun?\nIs there one bit of advice that you\nwould offer them or mistakes to avoid?\nUh bike setup or nutrition or casing?\nWhat's the thing? Can I give two? You\ncan give two. Yeah, of\ncourse. A lot of salt on board cuz you\nespecially like it's I mean it's\nprobably about 50° right now. You will\nlose so much salt. get salt tablets in\nyou. I think that's a thing that a lot\nof people just don't do correctly anyway\nwhen they're hydrating is like you need\nsalt as well as water to be able to\nhydrate. So take on salt. Uh and my\nsecond one would be put the biggest\ntires you can on your bike cuz like in\nterms of comfort makes a massive\ndifference. A third one use a tire\npressure calculator. Stra do one,\nWolftooth do one. They are really good\nat giving you an idea of what kind of\npressures you should be running and\nit'll probably come out a lot lower than\nyou think, especially if you're coming\nfrom more of a road background. Uh, but\ntrust the process. Take a little bit out\nevery time and the confidence it will\ngive you is unbelievable. I I I mean I I\ndid the\nthe Flanders Sport what a month or so\nago and I ran 32s\non a Argon 18 Krypton which is their\nlike all road bike and I ran 30 PSI.\nWow. Okay, that's low. Yeah, I had I had\na great time. And on this I'm running\n20. Please put your hands\ntogether to 54. I mean I just went that\nfeels about right. That'll do. I did\ncheck it. Yeah, about two days ago. But\nlower better generally. Lower is\ngenerally scared going low. Yeah,\nexactly. I think I think a lot of people\nare quite nervous about that, but it\nwill really change your experience a\nlot, I think. And it will give you a lot\nmore confidence, especially especially\ndescending some of the rough stuff. It\nreally does change that. Hi, I'm Toby\nPerry and I'm from Ashford, Kent. And\nwhat bit of advice would you give to\nsomebody doing gravel for the first\ntime? I'd say just be confident and\ntrust your bike because it can do a lot\nmore than you think. That simple. Yeah.\nYeah. do that. Everyone gets really\nnervous and twitchy and when you tense\nup is when you crash and have problems.\nSo, as long as you're calm, you end up\nbeing fine. What give you like bike\nsetup equipment choices, gearing, tires?\nUh, slightly wider tires is always just\nnice for extra bit of grip and that and\njust gives extra bit of comfort. So,\nyeah, it fits like biggest tires you can\nfit on your bike normally and see what\nsee what you enjoy. just checking\neverything's tight and the amount of\npeople I see with like just their shoe\ncleat that come loose after two hours of\ngravel and I have I've had it happen to\nme where my cleat and I've lost the\ncleat bolt. So just checking\neverything's at the right torque, the\nright settings and that's how I can only\nsay to people prepare your bike. Like\njust\ndon't just think, oh yeah, it's tires\nand everything else. It's it's\neverything. My biggest tip would be\nimproving your bike handling skills. And\nI think this is the problem that most\nriders have when they're doing their\nfirst gravel event. It's not like road\nwhere there's a you can just pick any\nline. You need to look through the\ncorners, pick your lines very carefully.\nUh basically hits the apex and then exit\nthe corners. And yeah, always looking\nahead of you if there's any obstacles\ncoming up such as large rocks. You don't\nwant to be hitting those. So yeah, just\nimproving your confidence on the bike as\nmuch as possible. I think that would be\njust a general really good tip that a\nlot of people can improve from. So there\nwe are. Hopefully some useful tips and\nadvice if you are doing your first\ngravel event. And if you are, let us\nknow what event you're doing by dropping\na comment down below. And if you are\nwatching this and you have done some\ngravel events and you feel there's some\nadvice and tips that were missed in\ntoday's video, then feel free to drop a\ncomment down below. But that is all for\ntoday. I'll see you again very soon.\nThank you so much for watching.",

My\nname's Rich.\nPerfect. Thank you.\nI've watched it for a couple years and I\nwas always amazed at how people could\nenjoy suffering so much and I said this\nyear I'm going to do it. My plan was to\ntrain and do it and have fun. Well, life\ngot in the way and I didn't train, but I\ndecided on still gonna do it. I got the\nSchaffer ready. Threw in a lot of stands\nin the tires. Uh, got the Victoria\nTorino dries with the Kush Core inside.\nI'm hoping that was the right choice.\nAnd, uh, yeah, it's going to be tough,\nbut roll the dice and go for it. It's\ntime to\nuh head over to the meteor for packet\npickup and get the festivities underway.\nI don't think I'm ready. Like I know I'm\nnot ready from a training standpoint,\nbut I have no choice. So, are you ready\nto watch some\nsuffering? You ready, Dex? Yeah. Am I\ngoing to suffer or am I going to do\nwell? You're going to suffer. We're\ngoing to have like cramps for like three\ndays straight. Don't say that. All\nright. That's about\nWhat's up, dude? I know.\nWatch out.\nAll right. Hey, get that thing going.\nYo.\nAll right. What's up, buddy? How are\nyou? How you doing? I'm doing good. Look\nat you. Ready to go. Got close, dude.\nBig old tires. That's what you need.\nTires. I got the big tires. That's all\nyou need. That's all I need. If you got\nthe big tires, you're good to go. Okay.\nCan you give some insight here? You're\nthe man, dude. This is This is\ndefinitely our hardest, most gnarliest\ncourse we've ever built. For sure. It's\nvery hard. I mean, it's very hard. Uh, I\nam, my name is Andy Chastine. I'm the\nhead idiot in charge. Uh, and the rule\nof three is 117 miles this year of\nsingle track, pavement, and gravel\nroads. Oh, and some B- roads. So, it's\nlike rule of four this year. And it is\nextremely hard. I think we got it's over\n10,000 ft of climbing.\nAll right. And all you need All you\nneed, Mr. Rich Drew his guts and you've\ngot guts. You got guts. All right.\nHere. You can unplug this one here.\n[Music]\nElement. Yeah. Blue.\nWhat's up? Are you ready? Uh, I don't\nthink so. What are Honestly, dude, tell\neverybody, Jen, I'm not here. What are\nmy chances of finishing this tomorrow?\nHonestly, uh, I think you will finish. I\ndon't think you will enjoy it. I'm I'm\ntrying. All right, I'll take that. I\nmean, you'll enjoy the first part cuz\nyou'll be with everybody. It'll be\nreally fun. And then as it goes, uh,\nit'll dawn on you what you've signed up\nfor.\nYes, sir. Absolutely.\nRich freaking Drew, dude. What's up?\nIt's Jimmy.\nHow are you, man?\nWhat's up? Good to see you. Yeah, me\ntoo, man. How is it? Good.\nYou want to working for the man? I know,\ndude. I love it. You're doing good\nthings. Um, I foolishly signed up for\nthe 117. Oh, boy. What? Tell the camera\nwhat you think's going to happen. Um,\nfor you or for everyone? No, no, no, no.\nFor me, this is all about me. Yeah.\nYeah. I uh I think it's going to go\nwell. Looks like you have the right tire\nchoice. That's very important. Some\nchunky dogs that aren't going to flat is\nprobably the key to this thing. Um you\nknow, be honest, dude. Like 17 miles,\nit's going to be tough. I think as long\nas you can keep eating, you're going to\nbe just fine. Cuz when people start\nfalling apart on the single track,\nyou're going to be cruising right by\nthem. So I think if you can get to the\nsingle track in a spot where you're not\ngoing to be hung up by too many people,\nyou're really good. It's going to be\ntough cuz I'm going to burn the matches\nas they say. Absolutely. Yeah. So So\ndon't go too deep at the beginning, but\nyou know, empty the tank a little bit to\nget to to the front and Yeah, you should\nbe good. Start picking people off on the\nsingle track. Got to find a good group\nto roll around with on the road and\nyou'll be just standing. All right. When\nit gets bad, I'm going to think about\nyou saying that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Just\neat. It's going to be fun. What's up,\nman? You're back already. I'm back,\ndude. I feel like you were like No, I\ncame back to do this. Okay. So, I need\nyou to look in the camera. Okay. Pretend\nI'm not here. Okay. I foolishly signed\nup to do the 117.\nI love it. I love it. You're going to\nhave a great time. I mean, you're going\nto die 1,000 deaths, but\nit'll be a good thing in the end. Okay.\nEverybody's telling me I've made a solid\ntire choice. Absolutely.\nYou can't fit anything bigger. That's\nexactly what you want. That's it, dude.\nYeah. That's all she wrote right there.\nAbsolutely. Okay. What words of wisdom?\nPace yourself. Okay. Don't get caught up\nin the front early. Yeah, that's I don't\nthink don't don't I don't think that's\ngoing to happen. Don't chase wheels.\nJust settle into your plan and do your\nchasing all my food. I'm told eat eat.\nIt will be an eating eating contest. All\nright, I'm good at those eating s.\nIt's cold.\nWon't be cold for\nlong. I have\npocket. Yeah. So, I'll put a couple\num in each pocket. Okay.\nGoing new helmet style. Oh, you're not\ngoing with a gravel helmet. No, I need a\nvisor. Are you kidding me? Oh, okay. Is\nit out there that long?\nNo. This calls for the sweet protection\ntrailblazer. So low key. What I'm\nsaying? Yeah.\nUm, what do you think, dude? So grapple.\nYou have to hold my bike, buddy.\nAll right, I think I'm\nready. You got the bike, buddy? Got the\nthe VCC bib\non, Fauier Cycling Club. Um, I got the\nzipperless jersey and then the sun\nshirt. Got a lot of stuff on me. Not\nfeeling very\nprepared, but\nuh whatever. Just going\nto give it a run. Looked at the course.\nIt looks like the majority of the single\ntrack is early and then you get a little\nbit coming back. So, it's like a lot of\nsingle track rolling out.\nBetter get out front. Actually, you\nwon't be out front cuz you're right\nbehind.\nRace starts at 7:15.\nPull up behind that truck.\nAll right.\nYou're going to do great.\nHow are you doing? You ready to do this?\nI'm ready to do this, dude.\nHey, 100 miles. Raise your hand if you\nThis is the guy you got to watch out\nfor. He might win.\nMile 1627.\nThe most important thing for uh me today\nis for you all to come back to the\nfinish line safe and happy and extremely\ntired. Okay? This is not a gravel event.\nOkay? I know that sounds crazy. This is\na full service day. Loose descent,\nsingle tracks, difficult climbs, low\nwater bridges. You might be here to win\nthis thing or you might be here to\nfinish in under 12 hours. In my mind and\nin all of our minds, that's equally\nnoble.\nCool. Let's stay the course. As we say\nevery year, you signed up for this\nchallenge. Stand up and face this\nchallenge, guys. It's going to be a\ngreat day. Let's do this.\nFive, four, three, two, one. Let's go.\nLet's do this. Come on.\nHere he goes.\nWoohoo. Game plan is take it easy off\nthe start. Woo! Heart rate's already up\na little higher than I'd like. These\npeople are pushing the pace, so I'm way\ntowards the back, which is\nfine. Just cruise through the single\ntrack and\nthen get through that. That's when my\nday\nstarts. Getting into bottle one. Two\nscoops of\nrelight. Get\nme all sorted to start.\nGood. How are you?\nGood. Get a sweet shot of you.\nYouTube channel. Virginia. What's your\nname? Nathan. Nathan. Nice to meet you,\nNathan. My name's Rich. Nice to meet\nyou, Rich. Nathan's never ridden this\nfar either. So, I'm going to stick with\nNathan, I think, as long as I can. He\ndid a 70 mileer with this much\nelevation. So, I'm going to catch some\nof his sweat and get that fitness by\nosmosis. Thank you.\nAll right, here we go. About 10 miles\nin, dropping into some single track here\nin P Ridge.\nThis line isn't as bad as what I saw in\nthe videos. So, you know, it's all part\nof it. Always a\nslowing. Thanks, Nathan.\nOh, I want to walk so bad right\nnow. Slowy.\nwater.\nSorry.\nHere we\ngo. Got\nourselves on the back\n40.\nAbout 19\nin. Legs are already in rough shape.\nIt's going to be a long day.\nUnited. Are you Gallas area? Uh, Austin.\nOh, okay.\nI would like to go by. No worries. This\nis definitely a little different.\nDon't know what the hell I signed up\nfor. Well, you signed up to have fun. I\nthink different kind of fun than you're\nused to,\nbut just keep your eyes up. Keep\nreminding yourself you see what's\ncoming, you're better positioned to deal\nwith it. And if anything gets chunky,\njust stand up and try to put more weight\nin your feet. So, drop those heels down\na little bit. That'll give you some\nstability.\nThank you.\nDismount.\nCome on now.\nThey make that in men's.\nYeah.\nHow you feeling?\nI'm feeling already. What you need?\nWater on that. Yeah.\nWhat?\nOkay.\nI want a regular one. Which one? Right\nhere. Here we go.\nThere you go.\nDo you have to eat the whole thing?\nOkay, I'm gonna get some water for you.\nAgain, shout out to Faded\nCycling. The best aid station I've ever\nseen. You got it, babe.\nYou got this, boy.\nOops.\nI broke that.\nWhat's up, bro?\nHi.\nHey. You want some of these?\nTake some of those with you.\nHere. All right. Just pour some in here.\nOkay. Hold that. Just Yeah, that's fine.\nAll right. All righty. You guys can\nchill for a little bit\nlike seen in a\nwhile. Let's go. Time to rip some\nsignature. All right. I knew it was only\na matter of\ntime. Puncture\none. Time to see if a plug will get it\ndone. Part of\nit. Mile 30. Check in.\nWalking up some of these punchier\nclimbs. Just trying to save it. Save\nwhatever I have in the\ntank. I don't feel horrible, but the\nVMO inside of the quad is already\nstarting to kind of pulsate a little\nbit. So, I just got to get through this\nsingle track, temper the\noutput, get to the road and gravel, and\nthen just chip it off mile at a time.\nHow you guys doing? Good. Use a little\nuh I don't blame\nyou.\nHeat. Heat.\nMake sure your body don't stop. Don't\nquit. All you\nlike\nit just\nit lick my\nAll\nright, aid station two. Filled some\nbottles. Going to do some of these snack\nbites and uh get back at\nit.\nMile. No\nclue. I've stopped\nlooking. I got some pavement though. I\ncan tell you that feels\ngreat.\nUh man, drinking. Eating's hard. I'm to\nthe gummy bears and those were going to\nbe saved for the very\nend.\nUh, I got a scratch bar I'm going to try\nto get in. Meeting Sarah somewhere.\nShe's going to have like an almond\nbutter and honey\nsandwich, some\ncoffee, and just\nkeep chipping away. It's going to be a\nlong one. Trying to do some math in my\nhead. Got to figure if I can average 10\nmph the whole time I'll get done in\nabout 12\nhours. All right. A little bit of\nrenewed energy. You can't see him up\nthere cuz he's dropping big watts. But\nman, Ty from Tai's Rides YouTube\nchannel. Super cool dude. Um years ago\nran into him in Slaughter Pen. Made a\njump video with him. Just awesome dude.\nreally helped the spirit to see him talk\nwith him for a few minutes and then\nsomebody said we're\nhalfway. We're halfway. Uh it's good\nnews. It's all downhill from\nhere. Not going to lie, this is hard. Uh\nI just got to keep chipping it off.\nPlain and simple.\nI know you.\nLook at you go.\nHi. And you're smiling. Smiling. Smiling\nthrough the pain.\nYeah. I can't tell if you're fake it\ntill you make it situation or It's all\nover, dude. Yeah. I'm kidding. Oh, you\nwant some some food and stuff?\nYeah. Proud of you. Don't tell me where\nI'm at. I don't want to know. All right.\nGot you lots of good stuff. Brought you\nthose we forgot about. A Yeah. And these\nthings if you\nwant. We have more\nsnacks. If you can't eat bread right\nnow, but sourdough.\nSure.\nWhat is it? Just Oh my god, it's so\ngood.\nHere's an apple. Uhuh.\nNo. Turkey.\nNo, no,\nno. I need to fill my bottles this.\nThey're frozen.\nA minute. Okay. Um I got to fill my\nbottles. You can stop.\nThat sandwich, that sandwich is really\ngood. And the Celsius is going to be\nUm, it hasn't been horrible because I've\nbeen going very slow and any hill, any\nhill of any significance, I get off and\nwalk and people are just coming by\nlooking at me. Um, cuz they just the\nlegs have been twinging for a while. And\nmy thought process is if I can stay\nahead of it and not and they don't blow\nup, then\nI'm going to finish finish this thing.\nStrong. What you got there? Nice little\ncold treat. Got it.\nSulfur water. Smell like a fart. Smell\nThat gives you more power for\nperformance.\nAll right, buddy. You want to start\nthinking about what we're going to eat\nwhen this is done?\nWhat? What is it? We're not going to pay\nit, though.\nThey're still open. I might be down for\nthat. And then maybe some spark. Oo.\nHey, you get a double scoop tonight.\nDouble. A double scoop. Maybe even a\ntriple. Oh yeah. You worked real hard.\nsupport rolls. Pretty good. Schaffer's\nbeen good. I got a puncture, Mom. Uh-oh.\nIt did. I had to plug it. You did. The\nsealant didn't do it thing. It wasn't\nNo, it started to, but it was big. It\nwas a nice slice. But the Torino Dries\nfrom Victoria have been good. The new\nsweet helmet was good. Yeah. Feeling\ngood. Glasses feel good. Glasses are\nwrap. Um, and the uh\nthe Vier\nsunsh I'm like in my own little world.\nJust been alone. Just been so alone.\nIt's just me. Nothing. I saw Ty. Are you\nlistening? Ty's rides. No. So, you\nremember long long time ago I did How to\nJump Steep Lips and just with some\nrandom dude and he was all fired up.\nIt's Ty. Oh, yeah. He's a rad dude. He\npassed me. I'm like, Ty, Rich Drew,\nlet's go.\nNo, not right now. I'm like, no, bro.\nYou go. I don't got it. All right, team\nCelsius.\nNot sponsored. Not sponsored. Not\nsponsored. I might get that coffee, too.\nOkay. Which one? The cold brew one or\nthe I'm joking. Oh, okay. What? Oh, no.\nYou don't need any of that, bro. Go get\nthem, Dad. Thanks, mama. Finish strong.\nJust finish. I just want to finish.\nFinish weak. Doesn't matter, right? I\ncan't decide if I want to keep this\nthing. Oh, your neck's going to be so\nsore tomorrow. I know. Ah.\nI mean, it's not I don't know how long\nit'll stay cold.\nWhatever. Okay.\nYou got somewhere to put it if you take\nit out. Huh? Got somewhere to put it if\nyou take it out.\nAll right. I'm\nwatch this way. Your gloves come on or\njust hold them. What are you doing with\nthose gloves? I'm going to put them on.\nMy hands are the worst. Oh.\nWhat? We stopped at the second aid\nstation and you know what song was\nplaying? My neck. My that every was\nlike, \"Whoa, what's going on?\" The whole\nthing, the explicit version. No, it\nwasn't the explicit version, but it was\nclose enough. Wonder what word they\nThat's all I had in my mind.\nLove you. Love you, too. Bye.\nThat is\nNice work, fellas.\nLooking good. Keep it\nup. Current\nstrategy.\nAnything in the red\nclimbwise on the old\nwahoo. I'm\nwalking. Legs are on borrowed time. I\nthink at this\npoint I still don't know where I'm at. I\nstill can't look. I know we're heading\nback.\nAnd I'm just going to keep riding, just\nclicking off miles till\nI till I know landmarks and kind of get\na better feel for being closer to or at\nleast towards Bentonville.\nupdate. It's getting real. Uh I'm\nassuming it's around\n4:00. That\nmeans like 8 and 1/2 hours I've been on\nthe\nbike. My assumption is I'm somewhere\naround 90ish miles, maybe a little bit\nmore.\nThat was the 29th climb summit out of\n39. I have nine climbs left. Probably\n25ish miles, we'll call\nit. Uh, the legs have been working, but\nthat VMO is starting to twech a little\nbit. I started taking the salt tabs. Uh,\nI'll probably start hitting those like\nevery five or so miles.\nBut it's a home stretch. Uh I can taste\nit. It's tough. There's a lot of people\nreally suffering. Uh it's brutal. It's\njust it's one of those things like\neating an elephant one bite at a\ntime. Crossing I\n49. I think that's a good sign. I hope\nit is. All right, getting\ndesperate. Going to go half of a 5h hour\nenergy.\nOh\nman, I didn't know we were entering\ntunnel vision up\nhere. This is going to be rough.\nyeah, I'm a new woman.\nAll right. I had no\nchoice. I had to\nlook clean\nthis 109 in. So close. Uh I'm glad we\ngot off tunnel vision and back on the\nroad was killing me. I've been in a dark\nplace, but I\njust keep thinking about what old Andy\nChastine said. Takes guts. I got them.\nThey're all tossed around right now.\nThey don't feel great, but I got them.\nSo, power down some salt\ntabs. Bring this baby home to mama and\nbaby bear. I'm very\nexcited. It's been a good one. It's been\na good\nday. Good job,\nSchaffer. I didn't familiarize myself\nwith the course\nenough. I'm assuming here we're going to\ncut on. We're going to rip down down\nunder the uh chip sealed. Super fun\npart. But from there, I'm not\nsure. But knowing Andy and Lauren, I'm\nsure there's some spiciness left before\nwe bring it back in to the\nfinish. All right, here we go. Last\nlittle bit of single\ntrack.\nOh, I've been waiting for this all\nday. So happy to finally be\nhere. I have to just cruise it. I\nthink I want to have any issues at the\nend. Ah, why\nnot? Yeah.\nYou did it. You're almost there. Grape\nlollipop or lemon spend. We're so proud.\nYou're almost there. We brought you cold\ndrinks. You're going to win the race,\nDad. Hey, your eyes look really blue\nwith your\nshirt. Do you want one of those? You can\nhave have a sip. If you don't have drink\nat all or any of\nit. Yay. Did you get a little turned\naround? It looked like a line went\nstraight up and then straight back down.\nLike you maybe went the wrong way. Oh, a\ntiny bit. Oh, okay. Tiny bit. Gross.\nTiny bit. I'm okay.\nHow you doing?\nGood. I'm ready to be done. Yeah.\nWe'll see you at the finish line. I have\nto poop very badly. I've had to poop for\nlike 50 miles. My belly hurts. I packed\nwipes. You could just gone to the\nwoods. This carbonation might not be\ngood for you. Okay. His poop's going to\nbe like, \"Hey, I got good news for you.\nThe portaotties there are going to be\nreally worn in.\"\nI got to go up that stupid thing. I\nbrought the tow rope. We can attach it\nto the van. Here you go. All right.\nI love you. Thanks. Finish strong, Dad.\nJust finish. You got it. Yep.\nSee you there. Yeah. We're going to go\nright now. We're going to beat you.\nKnew it. I knew we were doing the\nexpress way.\nSummit\n37 of 39. This one's going to hurt me\nbadly. So rad to close it out on the\nsweetest bit of single track for these\nbikes. This is the\nexpressway. Made it through the climb.\nLooks like I only have two more\nleft. Roll it back into the expo site.\nand\nuh take stock. But I'm feeling halfway\ndecent and I'm really happy about it.\nThis was\nawesome. Yep. Of\ncourse, got to add in the gravel\nconnector. But yes, so sweet of them.\nSummit 38 of\n39. Almost\nthere. There we\ngo. Summit 39 of 39. I looked at\nthat\nat 7:45 this morning. That's probably 11\nand 1/2 hours ago. and thought, \"Wow,\nit's going to be a long day.\" And it\nwas. Cressing this last hill on J\nStreet. I'm going to roll\ndown and roll across the finish and I'm\ngoing to complete longest ride I've ever\ndone on a bike.\nUh, was I trained for it?\nUh, damn it. I'm about to finish it. So,\nI guess I\nwas I didn't know. I didn't know to be\nhonest. I just started riding\nand just kept riding until I couldn't.\nAnd I'm still\nriding. This one's\ngratifying. That's for damn\nsure. All\nright, time to roll it in.\nI'm proud of this one.\nLet's go. Finish line. Come on. Push it.\nAlmost there.\nLet's go. Looking great.\nGot it. Mitch Drew did it. He registered\nyesterday\nand a win.\nYeah, buddy. Yeah, buddy.\nGood job. Good job. Way to go.\nGood job, man.\nAre you cracked? Yes. Yeah, I bet. Yeah,\nI'm pretty sure. Cuz he's a little\nstubborn. Didn't he just decide to do\nthis yesterday? I like two days ago. But\nyeah, he's a little stubborn. It's okay.\nI didn't want to let you down, dude.\nGuts gets it done. Right. Guts gets it\ndone right. That's all I thought about.\nGood job. Good job. You did it. Thank\nyou, mama. Proud of you.\nTake your bike.\nHolding it up. Holding you up.\nNice to see you making it. Brush it,\ndude.\nI need a picture.\nYeah, it's a\ngreat hide. Just leave it out here.\nHey dude, don't forget your bag. Yeah,\nthese are the two responsible for this\nmadness.\nHow was How's the day been so far? It's\nbeen an amazing day. Rule of three. It's\nbeen so good. Okay, I bet. There we go.\nYes.\nThe tire held.\nOkay. Rule of three. Done and dusted. Is\nthat how you say? Very dusted. Um, high\nlow dingalo.\nI I really didn't have a low, honestly.\nI mean, no. I just You mean you were\nreally hurting? Nah, I was never really\nhurting that bad. Like I I avoided the\nbad hurt and I was waiting for it. There\nwas one time I was walking up in the sun\nand I was kind of hot, but I'm not going\nto call it a low. So no low. Not even\nwhen you went the wrong way. You're just\nlike, \"Ah, whatever. I'll turn around.\"\nUh\nit's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] happens and he said that and\nhe's like, \"You're going to take a wrong\nturn.\" I took my wrong turn. I got one\npuncture. So yeah, my high neither were\ncatastrophic.\nHuh? Neither were catastrophic. No, my\nhigh was finishing, of course.\num was really cool. It was very\ngratifying. Uh longest ride I've ever\ndone. I mean, that's there's something\nto be said for\nthat. Um the\ndingalo was that it it wasn't as bad as\nI thought it was going to be.\nI'm going ask you again tomorrow. No, it\nwas bad. It it was bad, but I thought\nbad in a good way. It hurt so good.\nI mean, kind of. Yeah. That's just like\nit's very gratifying. Like it's hard.\nYou got to do hard [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] You know, Andy\nwas saying this like we used to run from\nlions and stuff and now we live in air\nconditioning and it's just it's kind of\ncool\nto not be fully prepared or as prepared\nas you should for something like that\nand go do it. And it's just yeah, like\nthings in my head, you know, like Matt\nMatt Deal saying, \"Oh, you'll finish,\nbut you're going to hate it.\" So, I was\nthinking about that. Well, I have to\nfinish cuz he said I'm going to finish,\nbut I don't know if I'm going to hate\nit. We'll see.\nUh Jimmy saying, \"Eat.\" I kept trying to\neat. Oh god, is that hard? Jimmy Smith.\nOh, just said eat, eat, eat. And I\ntried. It's so difficult. like four or\nfive hours in. I don't I don't want to\neat anything, but it was great. Um, bike\nwas great. Tire choice, the Victoria\nTorino Dry was legit. I had one puncture\nright in the center. It plugged easily.\nPeople were scattered everywhere uh with\ntire issues. So,\nhappy the gear was good. Voyier\ngear. They're from Austin. Met them. Uh,\nVoyer. Voyier gear. Are they finishing?\nAre these people finishing? Finishing.\nThis is how you finish. Um, the shirt,\nthe sun hoodie was clutch.\nGood job. Oh, I met her yesterday. She\ncan swim last thing. Nice. So, yeah.\nThere we go.\nUm, go home and probably have to help me\npeel this bib off. Oh, you'd be excited.\nYeah, that's Dex's job. Then we'll do\nI'll do like a full recap. Okay. Finish\nit in the morning. All right. Bye. He's\nout. Clippers. Cut.\nCut. I did it. Longest ride I have ever\ndone. And a lot of people ask me why.\nInstagram was flooded. Why would you do\nthat? Simply, and maybe as cheesy as it\nsounds, I was moved to. I've watched\nI've helped Sarah volunteer at this\nevent for a couple years now and I've\nnever seen\nanybody struggle so much and have so\nmuch fun. That's the simplest way to\ndescribe it. You know, it's brutal. You\nknow, it's a beatdown, but people they\njust seem\nto I don't know. They just seem to have\na really really good time. And I think\nthat's the spirit of the event. And it's\nhard not to get caught up in it. And I\nsaid, I'm going to do it. And I said it\nright after last year's event and I was\nI was bound to determine I was going to\ntrain and I was going to be ready. Well,\nI wasn't ready, but I came back to I\nsaid I was going to do it and I didn't\nwant to let myself down. And it was a\ngreat teaching moment for Dex. And I\nexplained it to him because he said,\n\"Dad, you're going to struggle. Are you\neven going to make it?\" And I said,\n\"Yes, I'm going to make it because there\nare times in life when you straight up\njust need to do hard [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you need to\ndo something difficult. You need to go\ninto it knowing that it's going to suck,\nbut embrace it. And that was what the\nwhole day was about, chipping it off.\nUm, and I used Sarah's Wahoo. And I\nremember after the first climb, it\nsaid a ascent one of 39 completed. And I\nthought, \"All right, cool. I only need\n39 more of these hills.\" And I just kept\nlooking at it and they kept ticking off.\nAnd I\njust one bite at a time. One pedal\nstroke turned into one mile turned into\nat one point I finally looked at my\nphone and I was 109 miles in. So was\nvery gratifying. It really is to to\nfinish it. Um I I didn't want to let\nAndy Chastine down because I kept\nplaying over and over again. What he\nsaid was, \"It's guts, man. You got to\nhave guts for this one. It's not just\nabout being in shape. It's about having\nthe fortitude to push through. The bike\nwas great. The Schaffer was legit. It's\na very comfortable bike, but it also fit\npretty big tires. Those tires I ran were\nthe Victoria Torino dry in a\n2.0. Very happy with this tire. The\nthing performed incredibly on the\ngravel, on the tarmac, and of course on\nthe single track. You have to go into\nthis expecting some punctures and be\nprepared to deal with them. I had a lot\nof plugs. I used one and it sealed\npretty quickly. I didn't even have to\nput any more air in it. Very happy with\nthat. The addition of Kush Core as well.\nUm, great. I was running lower\npressures, so very compliant ride. I was\nhappy with it. The drivetrain was money\nthe whole time. There's a new chain lube\ncoming out. Oh, hang on, buddy. I'm\nalmost done with this. Okay. What?\nIntense 100. It is. Yeah. Uh there's a\nnew chain lube coming out called\nTriboflux. Uh it's gone by Gra. Allied\nused it. I got my hands on some. They\nsent it to me. It's a wax base. I\ncovered the drivetrain in that stuff the\nnight before and then wiped it down the\nmorning of and every rest stop or every\naid station, sorry. People were lubing\nup their chains, dealing with their\ndrivetrain. I didn't touch mine.\nUh, yeah. I don't know. I mean, it was\nawesome. Very gratifying. I think I\nprobably already said that, but just a\ngreat community, a great event, Lauren\nand Andy. Well done. Um, congrats to T.\nLeadine for winning it. It was cool to\nsee Alexi out\nthere. Uh, I'm into it. Like, I dig it.\nI want to do some more of these gravel\nevents. It's really fun. Triding bikes,\nyou know. I want to leave everybody with\nride bikes.\nDon't like specialize as much as you\nneed to. Um, have fun. Ride what you\ncan. Do some\nadventures. I think that's it. I'm going\nto end it\nthere. If you have any questions, drop\nthem below. Uh, I'll put some stuff in\nthe text about equipment and whatnot.\nBut that was fun. I hope the video gave\nsome insight on what that adventure is\nlike. Uh if you have not done it, put\nrule\nthree on your bucket list. All right,\nI'd love to see you at a\nclinic. We got Bikefest is about to drop\nand then we have another clinic coming\nup here which is structured a little bit\ndifferently, different pricing, um\nshorter time frames, super fun. Love to\nsee people here for that in Bentonville\nand then we're heading to the Northeast.\nWe will be posting some events there\nvery soon. We can always do private\ncoaching here as\nwell. And yeah, gravel rider rich\nsaying peace out\ndumpers. Drink some more relight. Still\ntrying to catch up on my hydrations.",

The whole vibe of this event was very cool.  I loved that the race started and finished where the camping was and we could just hang around and party after.  I also love that it was in Bentonville.  Prior to this event I knew Bentonville had world class MTB trails but had no idea the gravel roads were so beautiful.  Everything about this event was very well done and another bonus is the price.  Compared to other big events, this race is affordable.  I will for sure be back!\n\nThis was my first race using Intra-Formance in my bottle and I felt great all day.  No stomach issues.  No cramps.

          "transcript": "rule of three bentonville arkansas so we\ngot into town on friday and the first\nthing we did was head to meteor coffee\nthis was a coffee shop near downtown\nwhich it had uh the packet pick up there\nwas going to be a shakeout ride from\nhere and kind of a little expo we ran\ninto my buddy max from high school and\nmax and i were actually old high school\nwrestling teammates and he is super into\ncycling now and he is actually the\nreason why i was at this event because\nhe told me that he heard it was awesome\nand he said he was doing it and he said\ni should sign up so i did and he\nactually did the three-man team 100-mile\ncourse and him and his buddies got it\ndone so kudos to them this was one of\nthe biggest shakeout rides i had ever\nbeen on the ride was led by payson\nmcelveen payson is a red bull rider and\nhe also rides for allied which is a\nbentonville based bike company so a\nbunch of people showed up as you can see\nand it was pretty cool because we were\nnear the back of the group pretty much\nin the very back of the group and so we\nkind of got to ride behind payson and i\nthink that's payson's dad and payson's\nfiance here we are rolling through\nkohler mountain bike preserve and and\nthis is our buddy austin he's a kc guy\nhe's getting a little bit loose on some\nsingle track here with the gravel bike\nso that was good to see but great day\nfor a shakeout ride here's a old lefty\non the mountain bike going down some\nsingle track you guys haven't seen his\nprogression but he's getting super\ncomfortable on the mountain bike so\nthat's really good to see after the\nshakeout ride we headed to this big\nfield that was actually where people\nwere camping and it was the start and\nfinish of the race and we met up with\nreese and brian and we met these super\ncool chicks who were camping next to us\nand we hung out for a bit and then after\nsetting up camp we actually decided to\ngo stay with my cousin who lives in\nrogers for the night because there was\nsuper bad storms rolling in and we\ndidn't want to camp in that\nokay so it's absolutely pouring right\nnow it's 7 50 a.m the race was supposed\nto start at 8 00 a.m the 100 mile race\num they actually have postponed it 30\nminutes uh but we've got thunder we've\ngot lightning\ni don't know what's going to happen\ndustin and i just talked on the phone we\nate we may actually uh drop down and do\nthe 50-mile\ncourse\ni think that's probably what we're going\nto do so we did decide to do the 50-mile\nroute but we had to run to the hotel to\nuse the computers there to get the\nroutes downloaded and then it was go\ntime\n[Music]\nall right just finished the first climb\nabout halfway up the climb my front tire\npunctured\norange steel\nstarted spinning everywhere but\ni'm thinking it actually sealed too\nshould be good hopefully so rule of\nthree is a bike race made up of all\nthree disciplines you've got tarmac\nyou've got gravel and you've got single\ntrack so i don't know what the 50 was i\nthink it was roughly 8 to 10 miles of\nsingle track and the 100 was roughly 20\nbut as we're bombing down this first\ngravel hill i hit a gnarly pothole right\nhere and you can see my water bottle fly\noff and i absolutely had to stop and\ngrab the water bottle because it was my\nfirst form in traformance and that's my\ncalories that i drink while i'm on the\nbike it's got my carbs it's got my\nelectrolytes so by the time i got the\nbottle and got back on the bike dustin\nwas gone and so then i just tried to\ncatch up\ni'm good\nwhat's up\nlike an hour and a half in 15 miles and\ni feel like it's been all like b roads\nand single track like i was telling dell\ni am not a skilled bike handler\num so the 100 mile route probably would\nhave taken me like 15 hours but\ni just got my second puncture this time\nin the rear\nand luckily i think it's sealed up again\nhere at the first checkpoint i saw a\ncouple of my kc buddies this is armando\nand wes it's always good to see those\nguys and it seemed like the first 15\nmiles of this course were all like\nsingle track and gnarly rutted out muddy\nb roads but after that it was pretty\nmuch just beautiful gravel and paved\nroads\nclimbing with my friend armando that's\nright climbing that's the word\nthis is climb of 8 of 10 right now it\nsays there's 10 big ones on the route\nso\n3.5 miles to go\nand we're on the second to last big\nclimb and\nit's starting to rain a little harder\nit's like thundering and lightning\nbut\nwe're almost there\nall right here we go post ride gonna do\na little voice over because it was\nraining and the audio in this video is\nsuper muffled but i want to say shout\nout to everybody who had a hand in\nputting this race on it was super well\ndone definitely unlike anything i've\never done before and major shout out to\nanybody who participated in this event\njust to line up for the start of this\nthing you know it took some guts nasty\nnasty weather and anybody who completed\neither of these courses great job and\nyou know one of the biggest driving\nfactors for me not wanting to do the\nlonger distance of this race was you\nknow i've done some big races that are\nsuper nasty and it's cost me a lot of\nmoney to fix my bike afterwards but i\nthink after this race i'm basically\ngoing to get by with you know just\ncleaning the bike up super good and i\nalready put a new chain on and i'm\npossibly going to need some new brake\npads on the front but otherwise all is\ngood there i also want to say this was\nthe first time i was running any drink\nmix on the bike i was running the first\nform inch performance i felt great all\nday i had no stomach issues i had no\ncramping you know it wasn't crazy hot\nbut i was still giving a pretty hard\neffort and the fact that i didn't cramp\nis a bonus so if you guys are interested\nin checking out inch performance i'm\ngoing to leave a link in the description\nto this video about 30 minutes after i\ncrossed the finish line it started\ndumping rain some of the hardest rain\ni've ever seen so i basically went to\nthe beard tent and hung out with dell\nand we watched a bunch of people finish\nwe saw the pros finished so that was\nreally cool\n[Applause]\nthere's a top two right there\nthere you go\nthere was payson mcelveen in fourth i\nthink that guy's like six eight right\nthere\nbut again shout out to everybody who had\na hand in putting this race on it was\nsuper well done and i cannot wait for\nnext year but anyways guys thanks for\nchecking out this video remember hit\nthat subscribe button like share comment\nand until next time keep crushing it\nhey",

          "transcript": "bikes designed for the road are all the\nsame right wrong just like many other\ncycling disciplines modern road bikes\nare designed to excel in specific areas\nat the cost of performance and others\nand while the amount of options and the\ndegree to which you can find tune a bike\nto your specific needs is great it can\nalso get pretty confusing so in this\nvideo we're going to break down the\ndifferences in frame design and geometry\nbetween just about every category of\nRoad and mixed drain bike available\ntoday before we get into those specific\nthough I want to take just a second to\nkind of do a crash course on cycling\ngeometry terminology cuz you're going to\nhear these terms coming up a lot in this\nvideo so let's go ahead and start off\nwith the head tube bangle the head tube\nbangle is essentially how far that front\nwheel sticks out in front of the bike\nand bikes with a steeper or higher\nnumber for that head Tu bangle are going\nto be a little bit more Nimble and agile\nbut might feel a little more Twitchy for\nnovice riders or at higher speeds on the\nflip side bikes with a slacker head to\nbangle or a lower number are going to be\na little bit more stable and easier\nmaneuver but not quite as agile next up\nis two measurements that we're going to\nkind of treat as the same for the sake\nof this video and that is reach and top\ntube length that's essentially the\ndistance from about where your seat post\ncomes up and connects with that top tube\nto the front of the frame bikes with a\nlonger reach are going to be a more bent\nover aggressive aerodynamic riding\nposition whereas bikes with a shorter\nreach or shorter top tube are going to\nhave a more upright riding position\nand speaking of body position the next\ngeometry term I want to go into real\nquick is stack and that's going to be\nanother thing that's going to determine\nhow upright or lean forward your riding\nposition is the higher the stack\nessentially the higher the handlebars\nare going to be and the lower the stack\nthe lower the handlebars are going to be\nso a lower stack is going to lead to a\nmore aggressive Lean Forward ride\nwhereas a higher stack is going to be a\nbit more upright the last number I want\nto talk about is chain stay length\nthat's the distance from the bottom\nbracket to the rear axle by with a\nshorter chain stay length are going to\nbe more agile and Nimble whereas bikes\nwith a longer chain stay length are\ngoing to be a bit more stable so now\nthat we have a brief understanding on\nwhat those measurements mean let's go\nahead and apply those to a few different\ntypes of road bikes starting with what's\narguably the oldest and maybe still most\ncommon road bike design and that is a\nrace bike these frames will usually be\nstiff lightweight and efficient even if\nthat means they're not quite as\ncomfortable and speaking of comfort\nthey're not going to have the most\ncomfortable riding position they tend to\nhave a pretty forward leaning aggressive\nbody position with shorter reaches lower\nstacks and a pretty steep head to bangle\nthat combined with some pretty short\nchain stay lengths makes these bikes\nextremely agile which is great when\nyou're weaving in and out of the pelaton\nso if you're looking for the ultimate\nbike to win your local races then look\nfor a frame with race geometry but if\nyou're more about just getting out there\nand going for a ride and maybe want to\nbe a little bit more comfortable then\nyou should look for a bike with a frame\nstated as having endurance geometry now\nat first glance an endurance bike is\ngoing to look pretty dang similar to a\nrace bike but often times these bikes\nwill sacrifice weight and efficiency to\nhave a little bit more comfortable ride\nwith features built in that help dampen\nvibrations and just reduce fatigue\noverall and speaking of fatigue if you\ntend to get lower back or neck pain\nwhile you're riding then an endurance\nbike is probably a good option for you\nbecause these bikes tend to have shorter\nreaches and higher Stacks making for a\nmore upright riding position so whether\nyou're looking for a bike that's going\nto be just a bit more comfortable than\nyour typical race frame or you want\nsomething for an epic 100 plus mile\nGrand Fondo an endurance bike is great\nfor you the next category of bikes we're\ngoing to talk about are aerrow frames\nand this encompasses a few different\nbikes Arrow race bikes time trial bikes\nand triathlon bikes these bikes are\noften designed in the wind tunnel and\nyou can tell by looking at them they\nusually have exotic shapes and look like\nthey'll cut through the wind like a hot\nknife through but and that's because\nthey can these bikes usually have other\naerodynamic features like integrated\naerob bars and hidden cables and\ncomponents to further minimize drag\nlastly aerob bikes are going to have\nsome of the most aggressive riding\nposition with a very low stack steep\nseat tube and head to Bengal and a short\nreach and while this might not be the\nmost comfortable for a long day out\nriding it does help achieve the fastest\ntimes and solo rides when racing against\nthe clock and that's what these aob\nbikes are designed to do and if all of\nthose pictures of aob bikes and their\nRiders is starting to make your lower\nback hurt just a little bit then don't\nworry because this next category of\nbikes couldn't be more different we're\ntalking about Urban bikes computer bikes\nFitness bikes whatever you want to call\nthem they're definitely not designed to\nget you from point A to point B as\nquickly as possible but they are very\nefficient and usually quite comfortable\nthese bikes will usually have a very\nupright riding position in other words a\nshort reach and a tall stack and not\nonly does that increase Comfort but also\nvisibility which is especially important\nwhen you're zigzagging through traffic\nin a busy Urban environment lastly most\nUrban bikes are going to have lots of\nbuilt-in mounts for you to add racks\nfenders and all that jazz and speaking\nof mounting points the last category\nwe're going to talk about today is known\nfor having lots of them and that is\ngravel bikes gravel bikes might just be\none of the most well-rounded and\nversatile bikes of any that we're\ntalking about today while their frames\nMay resemble endurance or race bike at\nfirst glance they usually have slightly\nmore relaxed head tube and seat tube\nangles a shorter reach and higher stack\nfor better off-road stability and\ncomfort on rough Trin speaking of\ncomfort more and more gravel bikes are\ncoming with frames that have some sort\nof suspension built into them whether\nthat's a full-on linkage driven shock or\njust some Flex engineered into the frame\nlastly gravel bikes tend to have much\nwider Tire clearances than their on-road\nsiblings some even boasting\ncompatibility with up to 700 by 50c\ntires all of that is perfect for a bike\nthat's designed for exploration and\nAdventure so if you're looking for a\nbike that you can take just about\nanywhere a gravel bike is probably the\nbest option so hopefully that helped\nshed some light on what the differences\nare between all these Road and mixed\nterrain bikes if you have any more\nquestions about any of these categories\nor any specific bikes that fall under\nthese categories please go ahead and let\nme know down there in the comments while\nyou're down there if you wouldn't mind\nhitting that thumbs up button to like\nthis video as well as subscribe to the\n999 spokes channel that would be awesome\nand lastly remember that bikes are for\neverybody have fun out\nthere",

          "transcript": "Heat. Heat.\n[Music]\nWe're in beautiful Emporia, Kansas,\nwhere thousands of riders mark their\ncalendar each year for the opportunity\nto take on miles and miles of the\ngorgeous Flint Hills.\n[Applause]\nThe North Course is punchier and\nchunkier. It's a beast. It's I mean\nchunky like the gravel. It's just like\nthese massive rocks. This event takes\nrespect and it takes significant\npreparation.\nIt's one of the most unpredictable races\nbecause of flat tires and mechanicals\nthat can happen to equipment.\nIt's just a beatdown. Like, I don't care\nhow hard you train. I don't care how\ngnarly of terrain you ride on on a\nregular basis. To race 200 miles on this\nterrain is just so destructive.\nHigh speeds, more chaos in the field.\nEveryone's just up in the game. Like,\nit's just one little notch after one\nlittle notch.\nThe competition level is through the\nroof. I think this is probably the most\ncompetitive field we've ever\nhad. A result at Unbound means a lot\nbecause it's a race that people around\nthe world have heard\nof. Unbound started in the parking lot\non the northwest side of town with 36\nriders. Um, and most of them were from\njust around the region. It was not a big\nnational event.\nIt's changed a lot. Obviously, starting\nin 2006 with uh no GPS and just Q\nsheets. In the early days, it was a\nlittle bit more choose your own\nadventure, if you\nwill. 20 years ago, Emporia was not a\ncycling town. There were a dozen of us\nthat rode bikes. Now, there are hundreds\nof the 4,000 people lining up to take on\nUnbound. 10% of them come from within a\n20m radius of Emporia, Kansas. It has\ncompletely transformed the identity of\nwho we are right here in Emporia.\nLifetime coming on board with us in 2019\nwas a big game changer. Um, Lifetime\ndefinitely believes in building\ncommunity and healthy way of life.\nThere's a history before lifetime at\nUnbound Gravel and there's a history in\nEmporia, Kansas before Unbound Gravel.\nAnd it's our job to preserve the ethos\nof the event and to ensure that when\npeople leave Emporia, Kansas, they know\nwhat the Flint Hills is, who the people\nthat live here are, what they do. But\nit's this community that makes Unbound\nGravel so special.\nThere are rocks flying everywhere. There\nare crashes happening. It is really hard\nto focus for 10 and 1/2 hours. Perfect\nworld scenarios don't exist in Unbound.\nI don't know if anyone has ever finished\nUnbound and not just had everything\nhurting. It just beats up your entire\nbody.\nIt's such a race of attrition. You're\ngoing to feel it so bad. Just brutal all\nthe way around.\nUnbound is the champagne of gravel. baby\nis the biggest gravel event in the world\nfrom what I hear and I'm new to racing\nand I thought there's a lot I can learn\nout here um not just from the course but\nfrom the people that are involved. I\nrode 300k a couple of weeks ago um on\nthe road and that was all right. Um but\nthis has got a bit more climbing than I\nhad in that and uh I've never ridden\nthat far before so it's not far outside\nbut it's enough to be intimidating a\nlittle bit. My son is actually in one of\nthe races. So, we decided to come down\nhere and watch him and make ourselves\nuseful. Just means the spirit of gravel\nand just like it's like there's no\nlimits. You're going to be maxed out.\nIt's going to be a mental challenge.\nIt's going to be a physical challenge\nand you're out in the middle of nowhere\nand it's just you, your bike, and you\nknow, whatever you can put together\nmentally on the day. You know, whatever\ncomes out of the wash is going to come\nout. you're going to have a real winner.\nMan, this is my first time here and so\nfar the atmosphere uh people uh is\nsomething else is amazing. Amazing.\nAmazing. Definitely they will this will\nbe in my calendar every year.\nUh we're going to do the Unbound Gravel\n2025. You know, it's we're coming up on\nuh what is it like 4:30 now. Um we're in\na pretty good place with the setup. Um\nyou know, nothing's left now but the\nriders. You know, we're just waiting on\nthem to get here and get this thing\ngoing. A little bit about our course map\nout there today. We've got I want to\nwalk everyone through what our riders\nare going to be facing. those first 25\nodd miles heading north out of town.\nKind of a gentle start to the day,\nletting all our riders know what they\nare in\nfor. Doesn't come until about mile 26 or\nso, but that's going to be the first\nreal section of the race that everyone\nconsiders. That's C Reserve Road. The\nfirst section of pretty challenging\ngravel up that way. From there, it's on\nto Escridge, which of course is the\nfirst neutral water stop of the day.\nJust beyond Escridge, of course, the\ninfamous Divide Road section. Another\nchallenging spot. Then it's on to Alma\nin the first of two checkpoints out on\nthe course. After that, Little Egypt is\nalways one of the toughest sections of\nthe course. That's going to come right\naround 104 miles. From there, we'll head\ntowards Council or Alta Vista, rather,\nwhere they'll continue to head\nsouthbound. And Council Grove then will\nbe the second feed zone out on the\ncourse where they have an opportunity to\nconnect with their staff for the final\ntime of the day. Just south of Council\nGrove, the course starts to head a\nlittle bit more eastbound and at roughly\n75 miles. That's when they start to hit\nthe Lake Cahola area. Twostep climb wide\nopen. One of the last big challenges\nthat they face before they start to make\ntheir way back into town after Lake\nKahola gets a little bit rolling. No big\nsignificant clines or significant gravel\nsectors on the way back into town, but\nwind is the story of the day at that\npoint. Crosswinds and tailwinds will be\npushing the riders all the way back into\ntown. Highland Hill by the university,\nthe final hard section before finishing\nright back here on Commercial Street.\nThis year at Unbound Gravel presented by\nShimano, we have the biggest field that\nwe've ever had in its 19-year history.\nOver 5,000 athletes racing across all\nthe distances. It's going to be the\nbiggest day we've seen yet here in\nEmporia. And it's also stop number two\non the 2025 Lifetime Grand Prix.\nYeah, I'm ready. Yeah. Now I'm just\nexcited.\nWhat's the plan for today? Oh, trying to\nsurvive.\nYeah. No, no plans. Yeah, just trying to\nenjoy it. It's birthday. Don't forget.\nAbsolutely. I'll wish him a happy\nbirthday out there. Right.\nCurrently sitting second overall. He's\nthe champion of South Africa. Welcome\nMatt Beers,\nyour current overall leader of the\nLifetime Grand Prix. Welcome Mr. Keegan\nSwenson. Yeah.\nAnd in 3 2 1\nWell, this year we've got more\ninternational competition than ever.\nIt's been great to see almost 50% of our\nriders in attendance for our Pro Men's\nLifetime Grand Prix event coming from\noverseas. Again, that first 25 or so\nmiles relatively tame in terms of the\nFlint Hills gravel that the riders see,\nbut always a very fast pace as they make\ntheir way towards call reserve road. And\nthat opening pace that was upwards of\nabout 24 25 m an hour. And what we saw\nhappen was uh we saw a big group pacing\nkind of coming out of the uh of the\nstart there. We saw some riders with a\nlittle mishap early, but the big talk\nwas we saw a big group of roughly 15\nriders separating very\nearly. Looks like that group includes\nCam Jones, Simone Pel, Toby Reed, and\nMazwartz Schmidt. Well, if this group\nstays out in front, it could make for\nsome very interesting moves later on in\nthe race. Well, as always, one of the\nnotables in our men's field is Alexi\nVarmmulan. We caught up with Alexi\nbefore the race. Um,\nokay. The goal of today is kind of\ntwofold. One, want to be ready for rule\nof three. I want to make sure don't get\ninjured, nothing stupid happens, and\nalso can can race effectively. Got a\nlittle 55 mile ride. Um, I'm Alex McMan.\nI race bikes professionally and I'm\nprobably most well known for riding with\nmy little dog, Willie. So, racing gravel\nprofessionally in the US has changed\nquite a bit from what I grew up doing on\nthe road.\ngone from very focused racing on winning\nand that being the only focus of the day\nto the minute you're off the bike you\nhave so many other jobs. Yeah, we are\nstill answering your questions from last\ntime. Um there's always been this dream\nto create things that inspire people but\nalso educate along the way. We kind of\nhad this idea about 3 years ago about\nhow why don't we do a YouTube channel,\nlittle vlog style here, a little race\nreport there. But I was very excited by\nthis idea that you could reach people\nwho weren't at the race. And so how do\nyou give them something to interact and\nbe involved with or motivate them to\ncome the next year? It's through\ncontent.\nIt's just I really enjoy talking to\npeople. I enjoy being around the expo. I\nenjoy creating content. It's not\nstressful to me. See a lot of guys kind\nof wrapping their bars further. I think\nit's just being honest with yourself,\nknowing that, okay, I have this amount\nof time and this amount of hours to do\nthings and I need to build this week out\nso that I can be the best athlete I can\nat the end of the week. Um, while doing\nas many of these uh off the bike\nendeavors that I've been asked to\ndo going into this year, the Grand Prix\nis my entire focus. Doing other races\naround it, but they're all a chance to\nprepare for the Grand\nPrix. I think the first couple years of\nthe Grand Prix, I was just trying to\nfigure it out, see what I wanted to do.\nIt worked out. I was lucky sometimes.\nThis year, I want to put some pressure\non myself. I want to try to win it. Want\nto take down the King Keegan. Racing to\nwin is different. This also means racing\nto possibly\nlose. A lot of these races, there's so\nmany great guys now that you can't win\nby just sitting there and hoping that\nyou're the best at the finish line cuz\nit's not going to\nwork. I'd love to be going to Unbound to\nHad Keegan, but I'm not. To me, when I\nstarted this year, tactically, I said,\n\"No questions asked. I have to beat\nKeegan at Seotter or Unbound.\" That's\nthe mindset. I don't need to win the\nrace. I have to beat Keegan.\nUnbound to me is mentally tough. It is\nreally hard to focus for 10 and a half\nhours and not make a mistake. And I'm\ntalking about not hitting a rock, not\ntaking a corner wrong, not overlapping a\nwheel, getting all your food, being able\nto eat all your food. It's It's never\nending. It's a lot about luck, but it's\nat the end of the day, it's a lot about\nhow mentally resilient are you because\nsomething's going to go wrong. How do\nyou solve\nit? I think I'm most excited to just go\nout there and race. I know I'm fit. Um I\nthink always the first race of the year\nis nerve-wracking, but once you kind of\nset a pecking order, um it's just about\ngetting down to business and racing a\nbike like you know you can.\nWell, let's see if Alexi has it in the\nlegs today. Hey, what do you guys think?\nAre you ready to send our women out\nthere on courts? Ladies and gentlemen,\nLifetime Grand Prix. Welcome Sophia\nGomez\nVisha to Vamporia. Please welcome back\nPaige Onweller.\nLet's try this one more time. Hey\nEmporia, are you ready?\nAll right, now you all warmed up and\nready to go here today. Our women are\ngoing to bring in the heat out here on\ncourse. We are going to go at 6:05. So\nriders, we will give you a little count\nand and Porter, you're going to make\nnoise one more time in three, two, one.\nWe are under.\nAnd our women's race is underway. It's a\nstacked field here today and looks to be\nan exciting race. Five minutes after\nsix, so 15minute gap once again just\nlike we did last year. Oh man, what I'm\nso excited for today's race. The women\nput on a show last year. I expect the\nsame thing from them today. And as the\nwomen roll off the line, you know, and\nthen you can feel those nerves and they\ngot off to a great start and we're just\nwaiting to see what happens today at the\nfinish line. Yeah, it was a great start\nfor the women and lots going on in that\nfirst part of the women's race. We know\nthere was a couple of crashes early on.\nIt looked like nobody got really\ninjured. Most of the riders uh save one\nI think got back in the mix. Here we see\nthe crash. Uh as as you said there, we\nbelieve there was one rider who wasn't\nable to get going. Emily Newsome was one\nof the riders down who was I think the\nlast rider to get back on her bike, but\nshe did catch back up to the group. So,\nshe's now in the in the big chase again.\nI think maybe to get a little more\ninformation, we've got our friend Lauren\nHall out there following along at the\nfront of the women's race. So, we should\nprobably move on over to Lauren. And\nLauren, what is going on up there at the\nfront? We are only a couple of miles\ninto the race, guys, and we've already\nhad a touch of\nwheels, a small\ncrash. The anticipation of today has\nbeen\nso intense trying to figure out tire\nchoices leading\ninto the conditions of today. having so\nmuch\nrain the last couple of days and uh I\nthink everyone has changed over and over\ntheir tire choices. Woo! Got some\nbubbles coming through\nalready. This is going to be a great\nday. These women are flying.\nUh the real story was uh Gabby Traxel\ngetting off the front pretty early.\nMerida. Yeah. Um, but Gabby Traxxler was\nthe story of the morning as she went off\nthe front solo. Former road racer, had a\nmajor major crash in 2023, uh, has been\nable to bounce back from that and has\nnow devoted her time to gravel racing in\n24, and here she's back again in 25.\nYeah, Gabby again, so much as I think\nabout a 2 and 1/2 minute lead at one\npoint, which was which was really quite\nimpressive. Our women's chase is full of\nnotable athletes including the likes of\nPaige Onweller, Lauren de Cresenzo,\nMeisa Rollins, and many more. Meisa\nRollins is fighting in this chase pack.\nShe's a former winner of the Leadville\nTrail 100 and is set up for a huge day\nhere at Unbound. Let's hear a little bit\nfrom Me Lisa. Since winning Leadville, I\nwent from sort of being like a top 20\nfinisher to now I'm consistently\nfinishing top five or just outside of\nthe top five in every race and always\nsort of being a part of the main group\nor what's happening in the race. I\nwouldn't say that before I won Leadville\nI was not strong enough. It was just it\nwas something clicked and now I feel\nconfident and I'm ready to be a part of\nthe race. I mean before that I always\nstruggled with confidence and believing\nin myself and not really sure if I\nbelonged. Every time I saw myself on a\nstart line, I always kind of like\ncounted myself halfway in, not fully in.\nBut yeah, I\nthink sort of proving what I knew deep\ndown that I was capable of has sort of\nhelped me build confidence to know that\nyeah, I was selected in the Grand Prix\nto race because I can race and I can\nrace well. In these long, really, really\nhard races, you have to have some kind\nof like emotional attachment to winning\nbecause they're really freaking hard.\nAnd that's the deciding factor in the\nlast hour, in the last 10 miles, in the\nlast 5 miles, at the last moment, is who\nreally freaking wants it. Everyone's\ngoing to have some kind of low in the\nrace. Not every low is created equal,\nbut everyone will have lows. So, if you\ncan make it through your low the best, I\nthink that's who wins Unbound.\nIt's always great to hear from me. Lisa,\nbut before Divide Road, a group of four\nwomen broke away hunting down the\ncurrent leader, the Canadian Gabby\nTraxler.\nComing at about mile 45.5, Divide Road\npresents one of the toughest stretches\nof terrain on the entire route.\nFollowing Escridge, this roughly six\nmilei stretch is a straight shot with a\nrelentless onslaught of rough, rocky\npaths, setting the stage for the\nchallenges to come.\nLet's catch up with our men. We have\nthem screaming up front. It is now\nsingle file. They are pinned rolling in\n40 plus miles into this like they are\nfresh. Looks like Simone and teammate\nare doing a great job out front here\ntoday. Time to get some fuel. Keep those\ntanks topped off as much as possible.\nThe last few miles and kilometers there\nwas not any chance of grabbing a bottle\nor getting any hydration in. They were\nin the drops. There was no sitting onto\nthe hoods. The terrain was just too\ngnarly and the pace incredible today. So\nmuch stress on the front end of this\npointy group. So many new players. The\nEuros have come over, done their\nhomework, wanted to get out front. and\nthe rest of the experienced players\nhoping that they can keep that contact.\nBut man, it got narrow back\nthere. These two really pulling away\nright now. The remaining 18\nbehind, doing what they can to get\nhydrated, but they are losing a little\nbit of contact. This may be the break.\nAs Simone Po and Cameron Jones begin\ntheir breakaway, let's check in with the\nwomen.\nAll right, guys. We have just come\nthrough some of the muddy sections that\neveryone was checking out at uh pre-race\npre- rides. Gabby basically has her\nchoice of line selection. It looked like\nshe was running a more of a slick\nuh in the center of her tire with just a\nlittle bit of knobbyby on the edge. And\nwhen she came through that mud section\njust right there. I mean, you could\ndefinitely tell she was all over the\nroad and really fighting that bike and\ntrying to keep it upright. But again,\nthat's she would rather pay the price\nhere. Hence her part of her probably\nsome of her race strategy to be up the\nroad and be more efficient with that\nslick versus having a more knobbyby tire\nthat's going to bite more in that uh in\nthat mud. But yeah, she is still she's\njust smoking it right now.\nLikely for a bit\nas the women chase add another rider to\nthe hunt. Let's check in with the men.\nCam Jones and Simone Po are still\nleading at the front of the race, making\nit look awful easy. But the burning\nquestion is, will they be able to hold\non to this lead? Well, that's anyone's\nguess at this point. But for now, let's\ncheck in with Nat Ross just in front of\nthe leaders at the base of Christy Road.\nWe got the kiwi and the Swiss leading\nthe cows up the pasture here. They think\nthey're going to get fed, but these two\nreally breaking away from the main group\nout of\nsight. And look at the gap that they\nhave put down today. Very\ncohesive. These two breakaway\nstrategists have put it together. The\nformula is working for them in their\nfavor. Okay, at this aid 70 miles into\nthe race focus strategy. Cam looking for\nhis crew. Simone has got the BMC team\nout here ready to do a bottle handoff\nand then some. You can tell from the\nlenses on these guys that the visibility\nif they can get a swap of glasses or\nlenses they will take it more\nintritically. Here we go. Simone off\nwith the pack. Cam trying to get\nvisibility of his crew. Simone dropping\none\npack. There he goes. Look at that.\nSmooth from Joan. Got another pack. He\nis topped off, ready to go. Cam still\nlooking for his crew in the feed\nzone. And at roughly mile 70.6, Cam\nJones and Simone Po still lead the\nChasers by about 2 minutes. Heading out\nof our first feed zone, Po appears to\nslow down just a little bit for Cam to\ncatch back up so they can continue to\nwork together. Well, the Swiss veteran\nknows it's still a long way to go, and\nthe odds are better with a little bit of\nhelp.\nGabby Traxxer continues to maintain her\nlead heading into Christy Road, but the\ngap has significantly decreased.\nThe chase group has now dwindled to only\nthree, but they're reeling in our\nleader.\nAnd they pass her just before the feed\nzone at mile 70. Heading into this feed,\nthis gives us a new lead group\nconsisting of Lauren Stevens, Carolina\nMigon, and Cesaly Decker with a 2 and\n1/2 minute gap over Traxler and a\n7minute gap over the chase group.\nEmily,\nlet's touch base with Lauren and see\nwhat's going on at the front of our\nwomen's race.\nFast, dusty course. How does it get any\nfaster? Oh my gosh, we just seeing Caro\njust over cooking that corner right\nthere. Oh my goodness. Saving it. Coming\nback and yeah, you just got to think\neveryone is working well together. Even\nthough you say like P Normal, they may\nnot essentially be under they're on the\nsame kit, maybe not the same team, but\nyeah, everyone working well.\nAnd let's just stop and take a moment to\nrecognize just how amazing our athletes\nare. While leading the race, Simone Po\npulls out chain lube and offers to help\nlube Cam Jones chain while they're\nracing. Sure, it gives them an advantage\nto continue riding with a partner to\nshare the workload at the front, but\nwhat a class act.\nAll right, we're here at the notorious\nLittle Egypt, mile 104. It's a 2.3 mile\nlong section. It includes two descents\nand two climbs. And you drop down into\nthis descent first and it gets narrow\nreally quickly as you come around a\ncorner, kind of off camber corner across\nthis bridge, dive into these trees. It's\nbeautiful. It's one of my favorite\nsections. And right now there's a bunch\nof standing water right at the bottom in\nthat in that turn. Absolutely single\nfile through here. Um I remember\nactually last year uh Mate Mahoric, the\ncurrent world champion, double flatted\nright in this section, but it just\ncauses mayhem. The climbs are hard, but\nthe descents are absolutely as decisive.\nSo this is the first climb of two on the\nlittle Egypt section. It's really steep,\none of the steepest climbs on course.\nIt's really narrow, but everyone talks\nabout the rocks. Um, regardless of\nwhether all the potentially muddy\nsections on the rest of the course dry\nout or not, this part will be gnarly cuz\nit's rocky. Um, you can see just how big\nthe stones are and because uh it's\ngetting to be, you know, make or break\ntime in the race. People are getting\ntired. Line choice is really tough. A\nlot of times there's really only one\ngood line because of how rocky it is. If\nyou want to switch sides on the two\ntrack because someone else in front of\nyou is losing the wheel in front of you,\nit's going to be hard to switch lanes.\nUm, this this section is just notorious\nfor being pivotal in the race. And a lot\nof it is because of this climb right\nhere. Here come our two leaders around\nthe corner just about to enter into\nLittle Egypt. Pillow and Jones are still\nway off the front at this point. about a\n7-minute lead ahead of the Pelaton going\ninto the very same spot. And we'll jump\nback in time and see the Pelaton coming\naround that very same corner again,\nnearly 7 minutes down and trying their\nhardest to catch up to these two leaders\nwho seem absolutely unstoppable on the\nday. As our men's chase group now heads\ninto Little Egypt, we've got Keegan\nSwenson, Toby Reed, Brendan Johnston,\nIan Boswell, Yasper Oakleion, and Yurus\nAnnewenhouse. Let's see if this\nstar-studded group can make any headway\ninto catching our two\nleaders. One of those men in the chase\ngroup, the Frenchman, Ugo Du,\nunfortunately found himself just a\nlittle spent at Little Egypt and decided\nto pull out of the race. I was expect\nexpecting one better day because it's my\nbirthday today,\nbut I decided to to to don't continue\nbecause uh was uh was impossible today.\nWell, I'm sorry to hear that. What What\ndo you want to say to Axel to cheer her\non? She's very very strong. She very\nstrong. I I'm the first uh first love of\nfirst love of Axel. So, yeah.\nI will I will follow this with for sure.\nWe see Paige Onweller on screen and we\ngot a chance to catch up with Paige\nbefore the race and here's what she had\nto say.\nMy name is Paige Onweller and I am a\nprofessional off-road cyclist. I ride\nbikes fast sometimes. This is one of the\nbikes I'm going to race. This is likely\nthe race bike. Uh this is a checkpoint\nset up with two twos front and rear. Uh\nit's what we call the the beefy boy. So\nwe are about just over a week out from\nUnbound. I head there early because I\nreally like the community and I love the\nriding there. All right, bike number\ntwo. It's such a important race and an\nimportant week that you really do need a\nlot of extra time to prep everything and\nrecon. The amount of equipment that you\nneed to bring to unbound is pretty\ninsane. More wheels, more bikes. Uh,\nthis is a new bike. Me personally, I\nhave really good support. I'll be\nbringing two bikes and five wheel\nsets. That just speaks volumes to the\nequipment that you need, but also the\ncarnage of the\ncourse. You have to have your equipment\ndialed. You have to have backups. You\ngot to be ready to break anything during\nrecon week and have another ready to\ngo. In 2023, I had pretty bad mechanical\nthat ended my day. You come to expect\nthese mechanicals and you also come to\nrespect the race. I line up at Unbound\nknowing there's a chance that I have a\nday ending mechanical again. You have to\naccept\nthat it can be gut-wrenching to say the\nleast. You build your whole first part\nof the year for this race.\nSo to come back and have such a good\nyear just meant a lot. It was really\nvalidating because that race and that\ncommunity is just important to me and I\nwant to do well there. 2024 Unbound set\nthe precedent for gravel for all\nevents. Historically, gravel has always\nbeen a mass start event. So the elite\nmen, the elite women, and amateurs, we\nall start\ntogether. However, in 2024, Lifetime at\nUnbound, they did a separate start. And\nthat was the first time the women truly\nhad our own\nrace. We had a nineup sprint for the win\nat Unbound, which is amazing. We showed\nthe world how cool and how strong and\nhow dynamic like our race can be.\nIt's just a totally different\nexperience. That was the first time\nwe've ever raced together, all of the\nIn the end, I feel like we really put on\nthe show that we're capable of. Good\njob. No matter what my result would have\nbeen today, that was definitely the\nhighlight of the race. And it's just so\ncool to see the women like doing it.\nUnfortunately, Paige was dropped from\nthe chase group at just after Little\nEgypt. So maybe not the day she'd been\nhoping for. You know, every year we go\nfaster. I think there's no way we can\npossibly go faster and then it just\nhappens again. The depth of field just\ncontinues to increase. Um, all that\nsaid, I do think there could be some\nhistorically fast conditions this year.\nUh, that all that rain that we got\nmidweek. Um, like Nat was kind of\nreferencing, does create some extra\ntackiness and traction in those corners.\nUm, and even on a course like this\nthat's so long, that's so rugged, um,\nthat doesn't have as many twists and\nturns maybe as some other gravel\ncourses, um, traction still does matter.\nMomentum absolutely matters. And even\nthough those might be small differences\nover the course of 200 miles, it all\nadds up. But right now, we're looking at\nour women's the chase group. It's now\ndown to eight riders. So curious to see\nif that gap is going to come down. We\nsee G in there. We see Sophia in there\nas well. So yeah, again, we wonder if\nmaybe there's a little more unity. Maybe\nthere's a little more cohesion in there.\nUh LDC at the back of the just a rut.\nYeah, she just got sideways in a rut and\nit was uphill, too. Uh, it's devastating\nto see LDC crash like that. She's so\nwell known for her breakaway game, but\nit looks like this year may not be in\nthe cards.\nHere's the dust off. This was a prize in\n2021. This is my belt buckle. Should\nreally do something with this, like turn\nit into a belt or something. So, I am\nknown as a bit of a breakaway\nspecialist. It's my signature move, I\nguess.\nI do a lot of things that just feel\nright in the\nmoment. Just the solo\nbreakaways. Ultimately, I just really\nlike riding by myself. I\nthink I like taking the risk. People are\nscared to do it, but I like to be brave\nand embark on like 90 mile breakaway.\nHer second win at the rat. She's got to\nbe so happy with this. I'm willing to\ntake the chance and do what it takes. I\nhate placing expectations on myself\ncoming into these races. The feel is as\ndeep as ever. The competition is\nstacked. All I can do is have my own\nbest personal performance. And it's like\nRussian roulette out there. Anything can\nhappen at Unbounds. As long as I know I\ncan put it all out there, I'll be\nstoked.\nWell, getting back up from her crash,\nLDC was able to catch it back up to the\ngroup and hang on. So, well, maybe her\nday isn't over after all. Um, you can\njust have a a little crash at any\nmoment. That doesn't help the morale. It\ndoesn't help you physically. It's just\nanother barrier on top of the distance,\non top of the heat, on top of the wind,\nand on top of the competition. Let's\ntouch base with the men. The the chase\nbehind has a lot of work to do. There is\nstill a small group between Oh, we got a\ncrash here. Keegan's down. Keegan is\ndown. Jeez, that's a big blow. We've not\ntalked about him a whole lot today. And\nthis is not the way we wanted to talk\nabout him. That's the thing, you know,\nthere there are technical sections on\nthis course, but a crash like that can\nhappen anywhere. That was a dead\nstraight section of road. Looks pretty\nsmooth, and it just takes a a quick uh\nquick moment, and your race can\ncompletely change.\nSimon, you're definitely showing some of\nthe the signs of strain as well. So,\nyeah, anybody's guess right now as both\nriders wearing that fatigue uh very\nclearly on their shoulders. This is one\nof our men's chase groups and on one of\nour other camera angles a minute ago, I\nsaw one of the SWAT club guys literally\nstop pedaling and start stretching,\nwhich means cramps. Um, and it looks\nlike this main chase group has\ncompletely exploded at this point.\nWindow of opportunity is is not it's not\nclosed completely, but it's it's it's\nreally come down a lot. I mean, I think\nreally they would have had to have kind\nof lit that fire almost an hour ago at\nthis point cuz that gap was so big. And\nyou know, you know, the the shorter the\nrunway gets, the the less time you have\nto really get this done. So with our men\nnow through feed zone number two at\nCouncil Grove, Cam Jones, and Simone Po\nare still in the lead with now a\n9-minute gap over the chasing group. Our\nleading trio of women, Cararolina Migon,\nLauren Stevens, and Cesaly Decker\ncontinue to add time over our chase\ngroup through feed zone number two. That\ngap now stands at nearly 14 minutes.\nBut that doesn't last long because just\npast mile 148 is when we start to see\nsome cracks in our leading trio.\nKarolina puts down the hammer and while\nCesley tries to respond, Lauren gets\ndropped off the back. This leaves\nCarolina in the lead of our women's race\nwith Cesaly Decker trailing in second\nand Lauren getting caught by the chasing\ngroup coming up from\nbehind. The four women catching up and\npassing Lauren are last year's winner\nRosa closer, Cesily Ljun, your series\nleader Sophia Gomez, Avisha Fany, and\nLauren de Cresenzo. And you know, early\non, I always like to say early in a bike\nrace, everyone feels good, but\neventually you have to pay the piper.\nUm, and I think we're seeing that now.\nIt has become a race of in large part\ngroups of twos and threes, maybe four,\nwhich is different than last year. Yeah,\nit's it's vastly different than uh than\nany addition I've seen. You know, very\noften we see those small breakaways, but\nthen it's generally a reasonable size\nchase group coming up from behind as now\nyou can clearly see our riders going\nalong the top of the the Cahola Lake\nthere. And you know, again, a wide open\nsection there kind of on both sides. And\nso I imagine a a good bit of wind coming\nacross. It looks like they're actually\nin little bit of an echelon formation\nthere. of the wind probably coming from\nuh the right just a little bit. The\nupper right there is they're flying.\nYeah, they're moving right. It's so easy\nto see using the those cement blocks in\nthe background as an indicator.\nOkay, we're here at mile 176 on Kola\nHill, which happens to be the longest\nclimb on the course. It's about a half\nmile long. Not very long as uh compared\nto maybe some other climbs out there,\nbut you hit it really deep in the race.\nUm it looks like on Saturday it's going\nto be hot, it's going to be sunny. This\nclimb is also super super exposed. If\nit's windy, there's nowhere to hide. Um\nback in 2019, I remember actually\ncramping on this hill, even though it's\nnot that long. So, uh once once you're\nthat deep into the race, um Kola Hill is\ndefinitely really going to hurt. And one\nother cool thing about this section of\nthe course is most of the pros will be\ncatching a lot of the hundred mileers at\nthis point. And oftentimes there's a\nlong line of people even just walking up\nthis climb cheering for the pros as you\nknow we rip by trying to decide our\nrace. So uh it's a classic part of the\nUnbound course.\nWell, Kola Hill, the real deal. It is\npointing straight up. There are a lot of\nfolks going different speeds. You can\nsee the excited folks don't know what's\ngoing on. Cam, just a little bit of tap\nsaying, \"Guess what, guys? We are\nrolling through.\" Kind of like the tour,\nkind of like the Gro on those mountain\ntops. This is out in the Flint Hills.\nThese two are now trying to stay keep\ntheir momentum. What a gap they have\nover the chase. They know it. They're\ngetting their first real splits. Cam\nsoaking some stuff up. Some information.\nThese guys are thirsty. It is full\nexposure out here. Once we pass the\nlake, you could just tell the winds are\nhowling. So, filling you in from the\nfield from our perspective. One more\nhill to go. Highland Hill is fast\napproaching. That's going to be the\nfinal opportunity to use any sort of an\nincline as a springboard. And we've been\nsaying it. We think Po may be uh ready\nto play out that card, but we are going\nto see here momentarily. All right, Cam.\nIn my opinion, even though he knows he\nmight be strong in her sprint, he's got\nto assume that maybe Simon is going to\nwa Look at this. Look at this. Look at\nthis. I was just going to say he's\nriding\naway. Cam Jones with the attack right\nfrom the front. So Simon Jones wasting\nno time. Po literally no response. So\nthis is the move. Cam Jones looking back\nover his shoulder out of the saddle\nagain. A big acceleration as he's now\ncoming into that deviation area. So Cam\nJones making the moves along the home\nstraight here. And I'll tell you what,\nwe couldn't have asked for a better day\ncoming across the line with a huge win\nat the 2025 Lifetime Unbound presented\nby Shimano. Cam Jones out of New Zealand\nwill be your champion on the day. Yeah.\nComing in with a welldeserved silver\nmedal and not too unhappy about it.\nTossing a bottle to the crowd. Simon\nPalo, the aggressive rider. Tourn Road\ndoing what we know he can do. He's just\nenough in the tank. Takes one look back.\nToby Road will be your bronze medalist\nhere today with a wellexecuted sprint.\nHi everyone, I am Meredith Miller and I\nam here with Cameron Jones, your unbound\n200 men's winner. Not only did you punch\nyour ticket for the wild card selection,\nso you are now in the Grand Prix for the\nrest of the year, but you won Unbound\nwith a long se uh long range attack with\none other rider. Did you plan on doing\nthat from the very beginning? Uh I think\nlike I was saying to you yesterday, I\nwas like it's probably in my best\ninterest to play it safe cuz there's\nmore than just like the race on the\nline. there's the the chance to be in\nthe Grand Prix that could potentially\nlose if I did do sort of anything\nreckless. But I was the whole time just\nsaying, \"Who am I kidding? I'm just\ngoing to ascend it.\" Um out on my wrecky\nrides. I thought that sort of towards\nthe end of Divide Road would be a nice\nplace to be in the front. It looks like\nit last year it sat up a bit and then\nthat next little loop there's some some\ntechnical stuff. It's always nice to be\nable to ride the front and actually see\nwhere you're going. It's It's safer, so\nyou when you can see any obstacles. Um\nyeah, I end up going a bit earlier than\nthan I planned. Um it sort of was all\nstrung out coming into Escridge\nand yeah, saw Keegan and my buddy Max\nsort of chopping off at the front and I\nwent to join in the fun and then rolled\nthrough and they all stopped. So I just\nlike kept on going and um I was like,\n\"Oh, I'm committed now.\" So managed to\nbridge across to there's actually quite\na big group up the road. I hadn't really\ntaken much notice of what was going on\nand they were all spread out through\nthroughout divide road and again it was\ngood to have everything sort of in\nsingle fire and spaced out so I could\nsee where I was going and just rode\nstraight through the the initial break.\nWe've got a a great chasing group, but\nthey're uh as unified as they seem,\nthey're actually losing time still.\nLet's uh check in with Lauren Hall.\nMaybe she can give us a little more\ninsight as to how these splits are going\non up there. Yeah, Bill, you know, you\nwere talking that there was only 20, 30\nmiles left, but we are in those long\nlate miles, right? And every hill is\nreally starting to add\nup. Carol is definitely starting rocking\nside by side, taking on fuel. And when\nwe were going up and over Hill, she was\ngiven the look back because she didn't\nknow that split. I think she now knows\nthe split to that chase group. But uh\nyeah, like you're saying, always\ncognizant of what's behind you, but\nCarol is definitely pushing forward. But\nyeah, Minan still looking strong.\nDecker, her teammate back there just\nabout five minutes down in this chase\ngroup. Uh maybe they were looking pretty\nunified, now looking maybe a little less\nso as they've reeled in Stevens. And we\ntalked about uh the potential for that\nearlier. They knew three riders went\noff, but that was so many hours ago that\nuh they've caught one of them now. So\nmaybe they're kind of, you know, not\nresting on their laurels a little bit,\nbut they're like, \"All right, we we kind\nof close that chapter, so we're going to\ntake just a little bit of a breather\nright now.\" And, you know, obviously\nthat's not going to help their cause\ninto uh trying to compete for those top\ntwo positions. So, here we are on\nHighland Hill, the final incline of the\nday, and doesn't have to worry about a\nsurprise attack from anybody. You know,\ncan just ride her tempo a little bit,\nand it's going to be one of the biggest\nwins as we've got uh one of our great\nfans out there, and I bet she's looking\nat that hot dog and maybe salivating a\nlittle bit about uh what's to come here\nto enjoy the fruits of her labor. She is\ncelebrating. So, what a great champion\nout here today to cap off our women's\nelite 200mile race. Round number two of\nthe lifetime Grand Prix. Your champion\njust about to get herself across the\nline. It looks to me like there's a\nwhole lot of emotion in this finish. I\nwould imagine some tears are being shed\nbecause what a day on the bike. The\ncrowd showing their love, the hands in\nthe air well before the finish line. And\nI'll tell you what, it's you couldn't\nask for a better finish in this. 2 hours\nsolo to take the win here. Silver medal\nride on the day going to go to Cesaly\nDecker. And she's looking like uh she\ncan't even celebrate right now. She's\nshe is cooked.\nAnd here comes our women's chase getting\nready to fight it out for the third step\non the podium here at Highland Hill.\nOh, Cecile making the first move\nhere. Huge acceleration from Cecil Lune\nright now. Hard to see if anyone was\nable to follow her wheel.\nNot surprised given the way that out.\nOkay, we see the wheel there. That's\nRosa right there. Yeah, Rosa. Rosa very\nquick to react. Remember when Sophia\nattacked a while ago? Rosa was the first\none to respond to Sophia. Look at\nSophia's body language, the shoulders.\nThat would Oh, look at this. One rider\ngoing the wrong way. Rosa going the\nwrong way, making that turn. So, that's\ngoing to be uh potentially a big issue\nif if Cecil Lune. Yeah, Cecil Lune\nrealizes what happened. Waiting to see\nif Sophia makes the big move around.\nRosa not making a move. There goes Cecil\nLune up along the fencing. Lun coming\nup. That door going to stay open. It's\ngoing to be Oh, this is down to the\nwire. Sophia looks like she's going to\nhave enough. Can Rosa come on by? Oh,\nall the way to the line. That is close.\nIt looks from our vantage point like\nSophia just got that one on the line.\nWhat an amazing finish.\nHey, this is Pac McKelvin with today's\nwinner, Ko, who just finished a 40mile\nsolo, 2hour solo.
