        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "This isn't Unbound—it's the scrappy cousin that borrowed the roads but ditched the circus. No prize purse, no sponsor cash, just a 'return to gravel days of old' philosophy that sounds romantic until you realize nobody outside Arkansas has heard of it. The 30-hour cutoff for the 200+ mile option suggests they're serious about suffering, but prestige requires witnesses."
      },
      "race_quality": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Completely self-supported with unmarked courses means you're navigating by GPS or getting lost—that's either pure or poorly organized depending on your perspective. The 'really, really, really hard route that bites on the way back' sounds legit, but with no aid stations and mandatory SPOT devices, you're basically paying to suffer alone. Quality control is your responsibility here."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Three surfaces on one bike—tarmac, gravel, singletrack—means your legs get variety while your bike gets destroyed. The post-finish party promises food, beer, and war stories at a gorgeous camping field, which beats driving home broken. Self-supported navigation around Beaver Lake spanning four trail systems delivers adventure, assuming your GPS doesn't die."
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "The Rule of $3.99 fundraiser pre-event and 'fewer dollars, more community' mantra suggests these people actually give a damn about each other. On-site camping opens Friday through Sunday with port-o-potties and no potable water—bring your own everything and make friends fast. When your philosophy bans sponsor cash for community focus, you better deliver the vibes."
      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "No pro riders mentioned, no notable past winners listed—this is weekend warrior territory. The self-supported format scares off anyone looking for hand-ups and glory, which means the field is self-selected for stubborn rather than fast. Arkansas location limits the talent pool compared to Kansas marquee events."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Reasonable entry fees with no sponsor cash sounds promising until you realize 'reasonable' is relative to getting absolutely nothing. Self-supported means you're paying for the privilege of carrying your own food and finding your own way. The camping and post-race party add value if you enjoy primitive conditions and earned camaraderie."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Bentonville location keeps costs manageable compared to destination races, but you'll need a SPOT or Garmin InReach device for the long course. On-site camping is cheap if you own gear, expensive if you don't. No potable water means buying bottles or hauling your own—death by a thousand small costs."
      },
      "length": {
        "score": 5,
        "explanation": "300 miles is properly stupid—long enough to hallucinate and question your life choices multiple times. The 30-hour cutoff means you can walk half of it and still finish, which is either generous or acknowledgment that the course will break you. Three hundred miles of mixed surfaces guarantees you'll find new ways to hurt."
      },
      "technicality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Emporia roads are notorious for being fast and simple—gravel highways that reward power over skill. The mixed surfaces add some navigation complexity, but technical climbing and handling aren't what end dreams here. This is about endurance and mental toughness, not bike handling wizardry."
      },
      "elevation": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "15,000 feet over 300 miles averages 50 feet per mile—not Alpine epic, but enough to grind your legs down over the distance. Kansas doesn't offer sustained climbs, just endless rolling resistance that accumulates in your quads like compound interest. The elevation comes in small, soul-crushing installments."
      },
      "climate": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Mid-May in Kansas means you dodge the summer furnace but catch spring weather roulette. Could be perfect 70-degree gravel weather or biblical storms that turn limestone into peanut butter. The length means you'll experience whatever Mother Nature serves for 20+ hours straight—pack layers and pray."
      },
      "altitude": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Emporia sits around 1,100 feet—basically sea level for anyone not from Florida. Zero altitude impact on performance, which means no excuses when your legs explode. The only thing thin here is your patience after mile 200."
      },
      "logistics": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Self-supported navigation with unmarked courses means logistics are your problem to solve. No aid stations, no hand-holding, just GPS coordinates and hope your battery lasts. The camping setup sounds primitive—gorgeous field, no RVs allowed, bring your own water. This is adventure logistics, not convenience logistics."
      },
      "adventure": {
        "score": 5,
        "explanation": "Completely self-supported for 300 miles with mandatory emergency beacons—this is proper adventure racing disguised as gravel. Unmarked courses around Beaver Lake spanning four trail systems means you're navigating by GPS and instinct. When the race description warns the route 'bites on the way back,' you know you're signing up for something that could go sideways fast."
      }
    },
    "final_verdict": {
      "score": "66 / 100",
      "one_liner": "Three hundred miles on Unbound roads without the Unbound circus—just you, Kansas, and the kind of suffering that builds character.",
      "should_you_race": "This is for riders who want the full Unbound experience without paying Unbound prices or fighting Unbound crowds. You need legitimate endurance fitness—300 miles doesn't negotiate, and the self-supported nature means your mistakes compound quickly. Come prepared for mental warfare disguised as a bike race.",
      "alternatives": "Unbound 200 gives you the same roads with aid stations and more prestige, while Mid South offers similar distance with better terrain variety and actual community vibe. If you want the suffering without the Kansas wind penalty, Crusher in the Tushar delivers mountain punishment instead of prairie monotony."
