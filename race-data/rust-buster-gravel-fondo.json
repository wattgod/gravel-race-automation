        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "The advertised 45-mile route actually measured closer to 52 miles according to riders. Padraig calls this \"a really terrific distance for a gravel event\" that lets you \"get home at a reasonable hour\" without burning a whole vacation day. More compact than Grinduro."

Early April timing coincided with the solar eclipse, drawing visitors like Padraig to Memphis. The spring date avoids the \"oppressive summers\" that Padraig describes as characteristic of this William Faulkner South landscape. More weather exposure than Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

      "altitude": {
        "score": 1,

        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Victory Bicycle Studio launched this new event around 2024, with Clark Butcher \"actively building community in Memphis.\" The 2025 cancellation and startup status limit established reputation in the gravel scene."

      "race_quality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Clark's tire recommendation to Padraig shows attention to course conditions. The route design avoids taking riders \"back over all the hills in Shelby Forest,\" showing thoughtful planning for rider experience."

      "experience": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "The opening 20 miles run mostly paved before transitioning to \"mostly gravel for the next 25 miles.\" Padraig met \"a number of really nice riders\" and connected with podcast listeners during the event."

      "community": {
        "score": 2,

      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "With a field of 75-125 riders, the startup event attracts recreational riders rather than competitive depth. Strava segments with KOM/QOM awards suggest fitness-focused participation without serious racing fields or pro involvement. Thinner field than Ouray Gravel Grinder."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Elevated post-race food including lamb tacos and key lime pie beats standard \"fig newton and warm Gatorade.\" The 50-mile distance with quality hospitality and Memphis pricing delivers solid value."

      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Registration runs $65-85. Memphis offers affordable lodging and dining compared to destination gravel markets. Padraig flew in for the eclipse, suggesting reasonable travel access, while local pricing keeps overall event costs manageable. Similar expense level to Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."
