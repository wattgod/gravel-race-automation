Early April timing coincided with the solar eclipse, drawing visitors like Padraig to Memphis.

        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "With a field of 75-125 riders, the startup event attracts recreational riders rather than competitive depth. Strava segments with KOM/QOM awards suggest fitness-focused participation without serious racing fields or pro involvement. Thinner field than Ouray Gravel Grinder."

          "transcript": "remember the Viking yes been took to\nweigh in the Gaucho a while so I think\nit's about time that start stripping\nthis down and then get it done if you\nactually remember as well this bike has\na really nice set of Shimano 600 the old\nold style not the one that I've used\nbefore not least 6,400 set that I've\nused before they think was missing was\nthe crank set because the cranks is a\nstrong light so I'm guessing that had\nbeen replaced at some point and\nfortunately we've got vintage Shimano\ncoming through again who had this set\nright here\nShimano 600 set 52 ring and a 42 ring I\nbelieve\nyeah 50 42 which will go on here now and\nhe sent this my way because it was had\nseized pedals in so didn't know if it\nwas going to be any good but he thought\nit might be useful for the Viking and\nafter a lot a lot of struggling with the\npedals I managed to get them free I mean\nit took like months of soaking so yeah\nwe've got a complete set of Shimano 600\nnow which is nice well for the for the\ndrivetrain anyway so let's get stripping\nthis down\nthere's Toby come in in to shut again\nwatching me and yeah let's get going\nguys stay there baby\n[Music]\n[Applause]\nyou\nthat came apart relatively easy but\nseatpost is seized that's gonna take\nsome work to get out I've noticed the\nrear wheel I've send you the front wheel\nhave been replaced but the rear wheel\nyou have to pull apart the dropouts\nactually get the rear wheel back in oh\nmy god yeah seized okay and handlebars\nthe stem appears to be seized in there\nas well oh oh joy\nso when oh yeah and all the attempts\nacross the top to bercy's and other punk\npegs are seized but I've still gotta get\nout so yeah joy there's gonna be a lot\nof fighting with this now hopefully just\na good soaking doesn't know I was gonna\noriginally when I first made this video\non my the introduction was going to save\nthe paint as it is Biff after start\nburning stuff heat and stuff up that's\nnot gonna work so I'll try soaking\neverything first see if it frees it if\nnot I'm gonna have to get a boat watch\nout and burn paint\nso I completely completely forgot to\nfilm the fight the fight to remove\neverything off this bike I would realize\nthat in the last clip I'm they're\nstruggling stem won't come out seep a\nswing come out and this took a lot of\ndoing to get out and as you can see all\nthe paint is now burned off seat post is\nnow free\nhow does they get this out I actually\nhad to use a pipe wrench on this so if\nthat's in focus\nich will it focus yeah you can see the\nIndians from the pipe wrench it's\ncrushed it a little bit some public\nafter replace the seat post anyway which\nin a way I think it's it's a strong seat\npost my f1 is a twenty six twenty four\ntwenty six point eight it looks like\nmaybe say yeah that took a lot of work\nto get out a lot of heat and then really\nusing that pipe wrench just bend it\nround\nyeah I've still got this band on if\nthat's ensure still got that band on\nthat is gonna have to be cut off if we\npan along the top tube we've still got a\nbig area rust there I'm hoping I'm just\nthis bike it's mmm and then this was\nanother barrier right here that required\na lot of heat to heat up the I had to\nsuperheat the clamps that are all on the\ntop tube just to get them like red-hot\nto break that bond of the rust that was\non the screw so that came off eventually\nbut the big thing is well if you follow\nmeans to Graham you ever seen it but a\nbig thing on this bike is this when I\ncan release this and bring it up oh yeah\nso the big thing on this bike is the\nstem decided to snap again I was going\nthrough the heat cycles on the tube here\nso just going through the heat cycles\njust lifted this top block not earth\nheating all around the top of the stem\nhere putting penetration fluid on\nheating up penetration heating up\npenetration I actually had the forks\nclamped in the vise so they wouldn't\ntwist because I was worried about\ntwisting the forks so the forks were\nreally secure in the vise they weren't\ngonna go anywhere the working a twist so\nyeah unfortunately that's snapped off I\nthought I saw it Bend and then next on\nmy attempts of it it literally just\nsnapped up in my hand so there's the\nother end yeah I'm there so that's gonna\nneed caustic soda now to get out because\nI'm not gonna have to do anything with\nthat\nbut this bike is just proving to be a\npain and I've got a dent offense a wasp\nso it's gone yeah this bikes just proven\nto be a pain massive plane it's a shame\nbecause it's hits a 531 frame it's got\nthe nice Shimano 600 600 group sit on it\nthe early one it's shown that it's such\nbad condition like this like hopefully\nthis area here\nstop creaking hopefully this area isn't\ntoo bad I'll see the frames gonna need\ncompletely repainting now because of all\nthe burnt areas I need some sandpaper\ncan quickly see how damaged the frame is\nso all that is pitting in the frame so\nso the only thing I'm worried about with\nthis frame is the rust and having may be\nweakened sections with the amount of\nheat that I've had to use this is still\nsmooth there are a couple of pit marks\nin it but with it being 531 tubing it's\na bit thinner then normal go and hence\nthe lighter so just they want to sell\nthat do this whole bike up and then sell\nit I'm someone because obviously it's a\nbit too big for me only for it to snap I\ndo not want that to happen so I need to\ninvestigate all this but first we need\nto get that stem out that's gonna be\ncaustic soda melting it how it's getting\nhorrible joy\noh just\nI got\nso what I've just realized is that\nblowtorch will actually hitting well\nit's stripping the paint because it's so\ncold and Christy well yeah\nheating up that bottom bracket shell to\nget that off I just use the wire brush\nto do that and then helping around here\nI've just tested it on this part and\nit's coming right off the pits come\nliterally right off so if I do that part\nnow I'll be able to demonstrate how easy\nisn't it\nit's a lot easier and cleaner then using\nnature Moore's for one so we'll see how\nwell can shoot this down but you can see\nall the pitting that's underneath so\njust got this you tame propane mix\nblowtorch and\nI mean Co easier is how easy is that\ncome on just go over the whole frame\nlike this Romilda patch of rust there\nbut that was easy just to do that this\nsmall little area seconds probably safe\nto wear a dust mask and all that sort of\nstuff but yeah I might just go over the\nwhole frame like this it will remove the\npanes but it will probably leave all the\nrust and then we'll see what it's\nactually like but like I said first\nwe've got to get that stem out that is\nno your heart that is heart\nI left my finger on that yes stems the\npriority to get out and then we'll see\nwhat the rest of the condition of the\nframe is yeah we'll see\nI think you might have seen in previous\nclip thank you this when I was cutting\noff the band here you saw the inside of\nthe seat tube it does not look good so\nthe way I clean that out it just with\ngets I've got some of these metal wire\nbrush pipe cleaners and just slowly\nrotate that down into the tube should\npaint out of or dinner a few times down\nthere but to slip it to clean out it's\njust lately cleaning the way at the\nwalls and then it can bring it back out\nthe other way just see all the dust just\ncoming out that tube come the rust in\nthe corrosion from the seat post one\nthing I noticed about this bike when I\ngot it didn't have the correct wheel sit\non it but also the wheels that that's\nbeen put on it he's actually too big for\nthe dropouts so you can't actually just\nslide it in in their frame at the moment\nis\nonly 120 mil the wheel is 125 so it's\nnot that far\nso what you want to do for that as RJ's\ndescription is you get something like\nthis like this it's just a this is just\nan m8 sweated blood washes just support\nthe ends a little bit and can you see it\non this end there's a bunch of nuts the\nVice clamp on it on this end we've got\nthe spanner and then that's and if I\njust wind this side up until it expands\nwe're gonna expand it out and why didn't\nthose dropouts 120 isn't enough and as I\ndo this again you cannot go into just\none to five because of the elasticity of\nthe steel we're just going to spring it\nback so the moment we're at 142 I've\ntook it to 114 mill if I just check that\nnow boom doing it and this is at 120\nit's not move that's all I might have\nmoved one mill so we're taking more than\none for two\nthat's how much you have to strips these\nframes in you'll be able to do this\nfairly safely with a steel frame depends\non the quality of it I guess Carbon no\nonion no titanium no just steel so Matt\n153 okay so let's try that\nalso let's hope that the frame stays in\nline I don't have a frame checking gauge\nthe moment took me from 120 mil to 124\nlet's just check the way\nI still need to get a bit more to fit\nthis wheel in I can obviously just part\nthe wave slightly and pull it in\nhopefully just part them in pull them\nI just want to take it a little bit more\ntaking course on this side I honestly\nthink this Frank so Benz is it been\nrepaired\nno man it's not right it's s he cracked\nthat's why yeah okay foam is no\ngood so say I had trouble with this\nframe anyway I had trouble getting it\nout in the wheel out and it was also a\ncase that the rear dropouts had been\nstretched and ridden on for I don't know\nhow long\npreviously but there's definitely a bend\nin this drop out I mean it should be\nsquare but you can see the damage done\nanyway you think it was getting caught\non was this there's a crack that runs\nthrough this drop out so you can't\nalways get that welded up I think before\nit's been folded up and strengthened but\nI mean this frame it's just in bits\nroasted frame wise it was a bad boy rain\nwise it was a bad boy gear wise it's a\ngood boy there's a lot of nice view on\nit but unfortunately I think this frame\nis not gonna get the restoration it was\noriginally planned for\nI've also just noticed you can't really\nsee it from this angle but the pump pecs\nand nothing like the pump the bottle\ncage she's a nut in line so I don't know\nif they were a later edition but someone\nbut they've not been centered at all\nthey are not in the center of the tube\nif you look down here the ruler ends up\nso yeah long Java is this frame has nice\ncomponents on it but I mean you can see\nthat's underneath the paintwork that\nI've taken off all that is actually rust\nwell that's speckling is rust that's\nclean metal strip whether it was\npotentially I think a cable guide you\nthose cable going on there obviously\ntough as well has it tops got rust all\nover it\ntop tube rust\nand then there's always that's still\nleft uncovered it's all that Sun cover\nyet and all done seat seat studies so I\nthink I think this Viking vision is not\ngoing to be for me to restore yeah in\nthe meantime I'm gonna get building the\nperge get that done going offroad\ngetting it out done son it's gonna be\nanother path Mesa style get that done on\nthe doors as well and the first year so\nget all those done and this one is gonna\nbe relegated now - I don't know wherever\nsomeone wants to do with it but yeah\ncast your opinions down below and we'll\nmove on to the next one because we can't\nsave them all",
