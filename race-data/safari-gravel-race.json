Local Kenyan men dominated the 60km top four spots, but overall depth across categories stays developing. Less competitive depth than Almanzo 100.

But I let my guard down on the climb… and flatted.\nLater, during a fast downhill, I flatted again – right on the first plug. I added two more plugs, stayed calm, and pushed on.\n\n📉 Fell on a technical singletrack climb (82–85 km)\n🚴‍♂️ Still managed to finish 3rd in my age category (35–39)\n🥉 Placed 30th overall and qualified for the 2025 UCI Gravel World Championships in South Limburg, the Netherlands\n\n🗺️ The course:\nKedong Ranch (6.5–35 km): Sand, lava rocks, fast descents, wildlife\nHell’s Gate NP (35–60 km): Gravel & tarmac through dramatic cliffs and zebra territory\nCommunity lands (60–95 km): Dust, cattle, kids, cheers – and that one nasty sandy climb\nReturn via Kingfisher Farm: Heat, fatigue, and that emotional final stretch to the finish\n\n🎞️ Highlights version coming soon\nThis is the full experience – but I’ll be sharing a cinematic highlights edit later. First, I’m heading to UCI Gravel Suisse in Switzerland 🇨🇭!\n\n📺 Unlocked by Tim\nI ride to explore, to push, to connect. \nWhat the road reveals, the ride teaches.\n\nLike or drop a comment if you’ve flatted too 😅 \n\n#SafariGravelRace #FullRide #UnlockedByTim #TeamAmani #UCIGravel #GravelRacing #GPXData #KenyaCycling #GravelAfrica #Hellsgate #ThunderBurt #RiftValley #Naivasha #GravelCrash",

          "transcript": "[Music]\nSociety\nI'm currently in karura forest\nin Nairobi Kenya and I'm out here ahead\nof safari gravel and the migration\ngravel race the first hit out on the on\nthe bike built it up uh this morning and\nI'll have to pack it away again after\nthis ride see their bikes got to be in\nboxes for\nheading out to Hell's Gate National Park\nwhere Safari gravel is and that's where\nLion King was based upon\nGreat Rift Valley Viewpoint it's it's\nbeautiful\nforeign\n[Applause]\nthank you\nthose who are doing the 120k can you\nplease be at the front lassandra James\nhello everyone for this course if you've\nnever ridden in Kenya before expect\nevery person animal motorbike and car to\nbe on the wrong side of the road around\nevery blind Corner if you expect there\nto be a cargo in the wrong way on that\ncorner you will be okay\num a lot of the animals wild animals\nlike zebras Impala giraffe Buffalo when\nwe go through the game reserve sometimes\nthey do run across the road so again\njust be careful uh yesterday I was out\non the course with the motorbike and\nthere is a lot of cows on some of these\ndescents there is some pretty big holes\ngullies and ruts so just be mindful on\nthe descents I would recommend if you've\nnever ridden here in Kenya to take a few\npercent off on your ending skills so we\nare at altitude here and it is going to\nbe very hot uh this morning has been\nquite cool but when we get up to the\nmiddle of the race the day will be very\nwarm I'd recommend drinking as often as\nyou can and if you run out of water and\nthere's no water stops there are little\nshops out on the course the road is\nrough the altitude is high and I'll see\nyou out there and have fun today it's a\ntough course\ngravel\nI tried to stay with the front group as\nlong as possible\nand then as I got dropped my\ndi2 stopped working I think with the\nthe bumpy Terrain in Kenya it dislodged\nthe the cable from the battery\nah it can happen to anyone I suppose so\nI'm stuck in the big ring in the one of\nthe bigger [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] at the back but the\nrest of the the kilometers I've got\nabout 105k to go\nit's gonna be a long one\nyeah gosh\nshe got speed today in Africa yeah\nInnovation style you know\namazing\nthis beautiful place no well so I can\nenjoy the scenery now\nwe're 30 KN it's getting Dusty\nque pasa Felipe\nhey John your faces\noh\nand uh 5K in My di2 stopped working and\nwith Shimano the batteries in the seat\npost\nso\nand squeaking my pedals my cleats\nstruggling to my right ones uh finding\nit difficult to clip in\nno change\nno\nI'm resorted to walking\nso I'm stuck in a third Cog at the back\nin the bottom and then the big ring\nit's really frustrating because I can\nride all this stuff\num I can't get my right Clinton without\nabsolutely\nsmashing my foot down on the pedal\num\nat least it's uh a couple of days before\nmigration grammar race and I can so at\nleast you receiving issues\nis what it is I suppose and I thought\nabout\n10 15K to the top and then downhill all\nthe way to the Finish\nwhat's happening Sammy so\nI tried everything\nI'm gonna cry\nit's like look what do you what if we\nadd some something I already did it's\nalready in there yeah everything I tried\neverything\nthe problem is this okay\nthe problem is that I can I can't it's\ndone you see look\nup\nI'm now halfway on the 120k loop\nand uh got one more\nsteep climb to come which will\ninevitably have to walk parts of\nprobably\num but as they say in Swahili poorly\nbully slowly slowly\nprobably another 5K and then I get to\nthe water point\nto get some more water and\njust enjoy the scenery\nuh not a bad day for a walk\nI've passed through the feed grab some\nwatermelon which was delicious nice and\nsweet you don't get that in the UK\nand uh\ngot a little bit of climbing here but\nthen all downhill well roughly downhill\nto the finish and any climbing that\nthere is I've been told is all on road\nso I should be able to\npower my way up\nyeah tough day on the bike on a fixie\nNational Park\nand uh I was told there was zebras and\nbecause I was going full gas I must head\nin the stem and just there chomping I\nhad the bit and\non the rivet\nI didn't see the zebras so fingers\ncrossed I see them on the way back\nthrough because that's the only thing\nthat I wanted up from this ride anything\ncould have happened if I saw a zebra\nthat was a big tick and uh a worthwhile\nride keeping my eyes peeled\njust say hello to zebra the baby zebra\nand uh some giraffe so I'm happy\nsuccessful ride box ticked off and uh\nfor about 5k to the Finish now ready for\nsome grubs\nwhen I'm ready hey\nhow's your day go mate no the day is\ngood but it's really tough and maybe I\nI made a little record last yesterday\nand maybe I see the route is really\nsmooth but today is only Rocky yeah\num and maybe for me the the problem\ntoday maybe it's the altitude and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]\nme in the in the climb I try to push\nhard but it's impossible and you still\nwon yeah yeah but yeah you know when\nyou're feeling the bike is good and\nmaybe a win or no is yeah you you happy\nor you know I'm happy now but yeah but\nnow I I'm [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] dying\nyeah and maybe it's a good warm-up for\nimmigration because maybe stay maybe\nmake a race in altitude and maybe I hope\nhe's better I think you've got advantage\nof it yeah yeah\nbut maybe like a living uh two thousand\nmeter I don't know in Colorado and maybe\nit's ready yeah and yeah that is nice I\nsee that giraffe really close to me and\nthis is amazing in Italy I don't see you\ndon't see yeah no I don't have a giraffe\nand zebra in Italy but yeah it's okay\nand yeah now in recovery wash bike and\ntwo days till migration a little bit\nrough a bit Dusty\nwill look good some of you were flying\nthe best was the two Dutch ladies at the\nback with me as they cycle past like\nthis group of hyena and I'm like hyena\nand they're like\nI'm like you're about to die\nand in first place\nshe tried not to race this morning by\ngetting herself locked in her room she\ntried not to I thought that was an\nexcuse Maddie two hours\n45 minutes\nI'm gonna get the drinks\nit will be well done yeah\nin third place\nrepresenting team Amani in four hours 30\nminutes five seconds set\nand in first place in a fantastic four\nhours 13 minutes and five seconds later\n[Laughter]\nthe competition in the mara is going to\nbe hot and fierce\nhere we go",
