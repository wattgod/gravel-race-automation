The course includes a notorious section called The Boneyard around mile 40, which riders describe as legitimately like rock crawling for 20 minutes that destroys your back and legs. Sharp rocks throughout the course cause frequent punctures. With 500-600 participants, dust becomes a major issue, causing chains to run dry around 40 miles in. The terrain is technical enough to break bikes and demands high volume tires. Riders report the event being feisty and more race-like than a typical gran fondo, with age group categories and podium positions. The course serves as good preparation for other technical gravel races."
