      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Post-race atmosphere extends beyond racing with locals offering late-night cruiser bike rides through downtown.

        "score": 2,

      "field_depth": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Field size of 170-180 riders provides adequate group riding but limited competitive depth.
