          "transcript": "welcome back to the channel have a\nlittle gravel racing action for you um\nthe last gravel race the season for me\nis CID\n76 um which as you might imagine is a 76\nmile sort of ride CID Colorado is about\nuh 2 and 1 half hours from Denver and\nsouth of Leadville if you know where\nthat is at about 7,000 FT elevation um\nit's called the banana belt of\nColorado and in that the the weather\ntends to be much warmer it's actually\nslightly um it doesn't get the cold\ntemperatures that Denver has in the\nwintertime so very mild climate here\nhistorically it was a mining town um\nthere actually was a smelter in the town\nif you know uh much about mining\nsmelting is a real nasty part of the\nbusiness it's where you refine the ore\ninto into gold or silver bars but uh\nnowadays Salida doesn't have much much\nmining going on it's it's all uh tourism\nit's on the bank of the Arkansas River\nand up in the mountains behind so some\ngreat mountain biking and gravel riding\nas you see here so here's the course you\ncan see the uh the course basically\nstarts in town goes up up over a huge\nyou know 3200t climb and then drops into\nSouth Park that's the same South Park in\nthe um in the cartoon and uh you do\nrollers in South Park for another\nanother 40 50 miles and then it comes\nback and goes up the backs side of the\nclimb that you went up\num that's about 65 miles and uh the race\nI think this race has been around for\nabout 5 years the first year they were\num thinking that they would actually\nhave the Finish Line be back in the town\nwhich would make sense but you'd have\npeople bombing that 3200 foot descent\nwith that's open to traffic and as\nyou'll see from the from later in the\nvideo it's a little bit sketchy so\nluckily the finish line is actually at\nthe crest of that hill and The Descent\nback into town is uh is is uh\nneutral okay let's look at the bike\nsetup I ride a 2XL Canyon Grail um I'm a\nvery tall rider I'm 6'8 um which is 202\ncm in height uh 215 lound which is about\n96 97 kilos so big Rider heavy Rider um\nand very few production frames that fit\nme in canyons are are good like that\nokay so uh Wheels I've got a hunt 42\ncarbon Limitless Wheels they're great\nnice light Arrow Wheels um tires I'm\nrunning the\nschwaba um G1 RS race in the 35 mm width\num as I will show in the video that\nbecomes a bit of an issue later in the\nrace um I wanted at least a 40 and um\nactually a 45 would have been better for\nthis race but uh the 40s were out of\nstock and I think are still out of stock\nto this day\nokay so the uh the rear cassette is\nactually not the stock you know the\nstock um with this uh with the canyon\nGrail is a um this particular Grail it's\na um grx 820\n1134 um that's the max that Shimano will\nvouch for in terms of uh biggest you\nknow biggest gear on the back on the\nback cassette um though I've heard\npeople putting up to um you know 4 to\nrear cassettes on the same same derailer\num I upgraded to a Shram 1136 cassette\nto give me a little more um a little\nmore climbing power um as as as I'll\nshow later in the video that also became\nan issue okay so um up front the U I've\ngot uh bottles I've got two bottle cages\nit's kind of worth noting that um the\ncanyon for for bike packing Canyon tends\nto mount uh the bottle cage is very low\nand on these big frames particular\nthey're they're almost impossibly low so\nuh I put these bottle cage extenders\nthey have different manufacturers but uh\num I put the bottle cage Ender I\nactually put my my tools and tube and\nall that stuff under there so it kind of\nlowers the center of gravity and keeps\nme from having to run a um a saddle bag\nbut I've got these huge one lit bottles\nand they were actually a little bit too\nbig um I think they were kind of\nstressing the the bottle cage extender\nthere's a lot of weight kind of of\nbouncing around with a a lot of torque\non that thing so I think then over again\nI probably would have preferred to to\nrun the typical um 750ml\nbottles okay up in the top I actually uh\nyou know foodwise I uh make my own um\nnutrition mix it's maltodextrin and\nfructose mixed together and uh I store\nthem on in a top Tu bag with this\nrestrap bag so here as I as I open it um\nyou can see I've got uh I've\ngot four bottles these are 3.5 o bottles\nof U of the mixture in there so these\nall all in it's probably 600 gram of\ncarbohydrates on the day maybe a little\nlight for a 65m race but it worked okay\nand also in in the uh top tube bag I\nstore a u a mini fuma pump it's an\nelectric pump so I don't actually don't\nactually carry CO2 on me for additional\nhydration I actually also carry the uh a\ncamel back so I've got 1.5 L of uh of\nwater up there so a total of of 2.5\nsorry 3.5 lers of uh\nhydration so I've been blathering I've\nhad the bike camera playing in the\nbackground at 4X speed um you can see\nwe're on the climb I'm getting passed by\na lot of people so at the quote neutral\nstart I I rode the rode the wave as far\num till the climbing started I'm such a\nlarge Rider that I'm not a very good not\na very good climber but I got as much\ntime as I could going up um and I let\nthe faster better climbers go up so you\ncan see we're just in the the\ntemperatures were nice probably in the\nlow 40s Fahrenheit we're just climbing\nin the shade so it's uh great great way\nto climb I don't like to climb when it's\nhot I don't think anybody does but enjoy\nthe scenery we're kind of in the in the\nshadows now eventually the opens up you\ncan\nsee so how I do how do you how did I do\non the climb um I have done this race\ntwice so I've done the climb twice and U\nhere's from Strava you can see my two uh\nTeam signs I've been up it actually the\nmy power was essentially exactly the\nsame 230 231 Watts um though this year\nwas actually more than 5 minutes faster\num it could have been partially due to\nwind it uh certainly lower weight on\nprobably 5 pounds lighter got the\nlighter wheels so I don't know I I'll\ntake it it's such a uh critical part of\nthis race to go as fast as you possibly\ncan on it without blowing up so I'm\npretty happy with that that\nperformance okay so uh here we are top\nof the hill um 2x speed we're going to\ngo over the other side so when you're a\n215 pound Rider um you better be a good\ndescender because if you're not a good\ndescender and you're not a good climber\nthen you're probably not a very good\nbike racer um so I like I like to\ndescend and uh I like to go fast you\nknow the downside is um you know the\npeople I'm typically climbing with are\nmuch more tentative on The Descent so\nthere's a lot of friction uh as I go\ndown these Hills but uh you can see\nthere's um uh the surface of the road is\npretty good but there's a lot of ruts\nthis is an unmaintained Road last year\nit was a it was a muddy mess and I\nthought I thought oh sure it's it's not\nas muddy this year so surely it'll be\nless sketchy but it was if anything I\nthink as sketchy or more sketchy than\nlast year so um there's nothing like\ndeep ruts and and holes to uh make a\nhighs speed descent um at the pucker\nFactory so here I am basically passing\neveryone um except for a few mountain\nbikers there's a couple couple dudes on\nmountain bikes were hurting on the\nhurting on the F but man they uh they\nbombed It On The\nDescent so anyway I put this in here for\nfun hope you uh hope you enjoy\nit okay so to recap you know where are\nwe on the course this this descent\nbasically drops you at the first aid\nstation you can see here I highlighted\nin blue uh kind of the start to the\nfirst aid station it's only 17.6 miles\nbut it took me uh you know an hour in 47\nminutes um out of a total ride time of\nless than three less than 6 hours so\nessentially you know pretty small amount\nof the race took over a third of the\ntime but uh anyways I did I did not stop\nat the first aid station that's kind of\nmy My Little Secret I carry I suffer by\ncarrying all that extra weight in terms\nof food and water on the bike but it\nsaves me a lot of time it's kind of\nsatisfying when you go by the Aid\nStation and 50 of the people who um were\nwere uh smoking you on the climb they're\njust sitting there waiting in line for\nOreos or gels or whatever um and you\njust go right by them and for me I go\ninto the flats where I I'm stronger than\nI am in the\nclimb okay so the second kind of stage\nof the race is from A1 to A2 so that's\nuh 20 miles from 17 to 37 miles um I'd\nlike to say it was flat you get a sense\nhere it's a it's quintessential South\nPark uh it some might call it desolate I\nthink it's actually it's interesting for\nsure um on a on a day when you're in a\nheadwind it could be it could be kind of\ntough but uh this part of the course on\nthis day we had a a Tailwind for the\nmost part so\nuh it's you'd like to think it was flat\nbut really you climb you climb about\nth000 ft over 20 mi so it's not a severe\ngrade but you know probably on average\nuh 1% grade so it's it's definitely not\nnothing but it's it's a low enough grade\nthat I can start to uh do much better as\nyou can see here I from the uh uh timing\nbetween the eight stations I think I'm I\nwas\nlike 86 out of 330 or 340 on the U on\nthe climb part but then by the time uh\nwe got to to 82 I was kind of in the top\nthird of the of the race so it doesn't\ngive it doesn't give rankings over\nsplits but um this is the kind of being\na big diesel like me this is kind of\nterrain where I I uh ex Excel to the\nbest to the most you could say that I\nactually excelled anything but um put me\non a flat course on a windy day and um I\ntend to do all\nright so the section of the course um\nfrom A2 up to kind of a Crest that about\n10,000 ft I'd say it's arguably the um\nprettiest part of the of the whole day\num it might not have the raw spectacular\nbeauty of seeing the seatch range from\nthe from the front side climb but um\nyou're out in the middle of nowhere\nyou're heading stands of Aspen trees\nthey're changing color as you can see\nhere uh it's a beautiful fall day so I\ndon't know you really feel like you're\nout in the wilderness and and you are\nthere's nothing out there except a few\nabandoned mining cabins it's National\nForest now um so you climb up through\nthe through the trees and then go to a a\nbig long descent and uh that descent\nproved somewhat technical um I actually\nI actually almost almost lost it going\ndown that as you'll see\nshortly so by this point in the race\nwe're about 40 miles in I've already\nskipped two eight stations and uh I\nthink a lot of people as as is typical\nuh blew themselves out on the opening\nclimb as I held back quite a bit I was\nfeeling great I felt very strong on the\non the flat part of course we had a\nTailwind for most of it um but even\ngoing up to the crest of this climb I I\nwas feeling my legs felt fantastic I\nfelt well well fueled well hydrated uh\nby the end of The Descent I I was uh um\nit would it took it out of me um when we\nstarted back up climbing at the base of\nthe Descent um just my body was tired so\nthose we often forget about it but those\ntechnical uh rough descents they really\ndo take it out of your body uh my back\nwas hurting by the time we were down to\nthe bottom and uh it felt like a totally\ntotally different Race So at Mile 40\nversus mile say\n4750 uh that's where I kind of I\nwouldn't say I fell apart but I felt\nlike I was I was definitely out um a\nhard day at the bike on hard day on the\nbike at that\npoint so I've always pride of myself in\na it's being a fairly good bike Handler\nI like to I like to descend like to\ndescend fast and I usually descend\nfaster than most of the people that I am\nriding with at a given point but this is\nwhen I started to question my handling\nabilities and my tires uh came around\nthis right-hander and just overcooked it\nbasically um I I I wouldn't say you\ncould blame it too much on the tires but\nI did start to grab the brakes and the\nand basically the basically the bike\nstarted to slide and uh I could tell I\ndid not have control so luckily I just I\njust rode up and over the BM I had a\npretty good run out missed a big rock\nand uh was able to stay stay upright and\nwrite it back onto the course but uh you\nwould have thought that I would have\nlearned at that point but uh I didn't I\nhad another mishap later in the day as\nyou'll shortly\nsee so after the long descent it ends at\nlike mile you know 44 there's a lot of\nups and downs and I i' classify the next\nsay 10 m as just 5 m rollers uh not even\nrollers some some of the hills are\npretty steep but uh uh a lot of up a lot\nof down and uh hard to get continuity\nand I will say this it was it was where\nwe kind of uh we we got payback for the\nfact that we had uh a Tailwind earlier\nin the race um there was a pretty pretty\nstout headwind and uh by the time I was\nout there really nobody to work with um\neven if there was someone to work with\nthe people uh who do the gravel races\njust aren't they aren't typically like\nRoad RAC Savvy for the most part um so\nvery rarely will you find someone to\nwork with the only time I ever worked\nwith anybody in in a road in a gravel\nrace uh I was in Finland and uh found\nanother road racer from Colorado who was\nwho was there and uh we we traded polls\nfor like 10 miles it was fantastic but\nuh it's the only time ever where I\nconstructively worked with another\nanother ryer um changing gears no pun\nintended um around mile 47 up one of\nthose those climbs um I noticed that I I\ncould not shift into my lowest two gears\nso I had had I I had had no problems at\nall with the drivetrain up until that\npoint um I said this is exactly\nwhat happened to me at Steamboat gravel\nuh I just you know the cable the barrel\nwas fully loosened and nonetheless I I\ndid not have access to the lowest gear\nso anyway I I had the bike service and\nit seem to work perfectly um so I\nstopped pulled off the road and loosened\nthe barrel again a good bit and I was\nable to get my gears back as I kept\nriding and I got to the next tail I\nnoticed that I I no longer had now the\nlowest three gears so um this is this is\nwell beyond just cable stretch it was\nhappening in real time I don't know\nwhat's wrong with the bike I suspected\nsomething to do with the with the\nshifters uh so my friend the bike\nmechanic has it and I'm I'm prepared to\nbuy a new shifter but um that was very\ndisappointing to have essentially the\nsame mechanical again and um it really\nit's sort of a um when you're you're\ngoing up climbs you're in the kind of\nthe dark place in the ride and a\nheadwind you're 55 miles in that's it's\nkind of a dark place and you really have\nto use all your all your faculties to um\nnot let it mentally spin out of control\nso you know I was I was okay um I was\nable I was still able to uh you know\neven even with missing my three lowest\ngears I had acceptable acceptable\ngearing for the for the uh climbs on the\nflattish part of the course but I knew\nthat I needed to stop at at the uh so\nthe basically the course it comes back\nAid three on this course is actually the\nsame as aid1 so you basically come back\non the loop and uh so my thought was\nwell I'll stop it at at the Aid Station\nregrettably and and screw around with\nthe barrel again to see if I can get my\ngears back well I got to the eight\nstation and was very disappointed that\nuh I had no more no more Barrel left so\nthere's there's something desperately\nwrong with the shifter so I knew I had\nto do the backside of the Steep of the\ninitial climb missing my three lowest\ngears so at that point I said well I\nknew there were there's one section in\nparticular that's like 11% for like a\nhalf mile I I knew I was going to walk\nthat and I knew I was going to walk this\nsection right before the end of it so\nyou always hate to to uh know that\nyou're going to hike a bike but you know\nthe the cost of of riding it out when\nyou're going to be spining 30 RPM at 300\nwatts is just you know not not worth it\nso anyway Mechanicals got me\nagain so for me the uh Descent of the of\nthe course after you finished the time\nsection is uh almost the Highlight it's\njust it's gorgeous and uh flowy and you\nknow last year I just bombed it and\nloved it I just had a smile on my face\nat the end of it um so if you can kind\nof compare how did I you know how did I\ndo this year relative to last year um so\nhere are the\nresults I took I took 50 minutes off my\ntime from last year it's not quite Fair\nthere are some mitigating factors last\nyear it was very muddy um so obviously\nI'm going to be somewhat slower but I I\ndon't think I would have been 50 minutes\nslower in the mud um I think I stopped\nat all the eight stations last year\nwhereas I only stopped at one this year\nand I I didn't even need food I was just\ntrying to get some mechanical assistance\nwhich which I didn't get um and also\nthis year I had to had to hike a bike so\nwhen you look at the average power the\naverage power was actually you know the\nsame from this year to last and I've\nbeen doing a year of structured training\nso it's a little bit disappointing but\num I probably hiked a bike\nfor 20 plus\nminutes so in fact if you um make a\nStrava segment that is just from the\nstart until the uh third aid station so\nignoring the hika bik part you compare\nmy performance from this year to last\nyear um yeah I put an hour into my last\nyear's time um 8 watts more power and 2\nmph faster so again part of that's mud\nbut uh part of it's lower weight greater\nefficiency faster Wheels faster tires um\nso yeah pretty interesting so pretty\nsuccessful from a bike racer standpoint\nto see that kind of improvement um one\nyear to the\nnext so I keep alluding to this uh crash\nthat happened you probably know it's\ncoming um not too much to say about it I\nbasically uh was hanging to the right\nside of the road because there was\noncoming traffic it was loose over there\nI came up over a kettle guard and uh\njust found myself kind of needing to\nbreak more than I would have liked and\nthe tires basically just did not bite it\nbasically went into a two wheel skid\nright away it's funny you look at the\nyou watch the video of the crash and you\ncan see multiple tire tracks going right\ninto the right into the ditch um I was\nable to you know get a foot out and kind\nof just go high side kind of chest first\ninto the ground but it wasn't a horrible\ncrash um I might have broken a red but\nbut you know not too much you can do\nabout it few cuts and bruises um pulled\na splinter out of my chest I'll probably\npulling splinters out of my body for the\nnext uh next three days as they turn red\nand angry\nso I was having issues with uh not being\nable to access the lowest gears in my uh\non my rear cassette um I couldn't get\nthe lowest three before the crash after\nthe crash um I couldn't get the lowest\nlike seven or eight so I was kind of\nstuck in a I was stuck like a small ring\nin the front and somewhere very high in\nthe back um I actually bent a couple\ncouple um teeth on the front U um front\nbig ring so I've got to replace that\nprobably have to replace the shifter\nassuming that's what it is but uh not a\ngreat day for bike maintenance bike\nMechanicals well slot of 76 is kind of a\nsmall race so don't expect a Heroes\nwelcome when you finish but uh it's a\ngood good atmosphere at the finish uh\ncool group of people and fun I'll be\nback again and hope you got some value\nout of this uh out of this video it's a\nbit long I apologize for that but uh see\nyou out there next year",

more\nabsolutely\namazing this is pretty wild out here all\nright hit\nit I'm about ready to collapse here this\njust\nhappened this may be it I'm retiring\nafter\nthis\n[Music]\nwhat is up people

we hav't in this thing in a\nlong time it's been a couple month can\nso we'll see how this turns out uh climb\nlike 4,000 ft off the back for like 14\nor 15\nmiles so you get a lot of climbing out\nof the way so you know a rough 14 or 15\nmiles worth gets up to over 10,000 ft\nalso\ngoing I don't know just looking to have\nsome fun and finish today we uh we've\nbeen in the vanin for the last week

there's that on\nmy well the climate started and we've\nalready stopped to shed some layers and\nwe've been in our granny gear for a\nyeah we want\nmore there nothing like a 14 miles 14 M\nclimb to warm up everything in your body\nwe are legit back to the pack today\nwe've been in our lowest gear for a\nwhile though I know we're getting there\nslowly I'm ready for this climb to be\nover it's especially hard for us on this\nbig old thing so we're trying our best\nthis is really pretty up here if you\nremember to stop and look\naround\nyou want me to capture you\nguys that's okay thank you

The course features a brutal 14-15 mile opening climb gaining 4,000 feet to over 10,000 feet elevation, requiring extended time in granny gears. Riders then descend into South Park for 40-50 miles of rollers before tackling the backside of the same climb around mile 65. The finish line is positioned at the crest to avoid a sketchy 3200-foot descent back to town that's open to traffic. Weather can be variable with chilly morning starts in the 40s and potential mud conditions from overnight precipitation. Riders recommend wider tires (40-45mm preferred over 35mm) and lower gearing for the sustained climbing. The race has been running for about 5 years in this historic mining town known as Colorado's banana belt for its mild climate."
