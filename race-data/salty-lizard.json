          "transcript": "foreign\n[Music]\n[Applause]\nthank you\nwelcome to the 2022 salty lizard 100\ngravel race\nthis is a little over 100 mile course\nthrough the desert around Windover\nNevada\nand this is my very first Scrabble race\nI'm going to break the salty lizard down\ninto five sections this first section\nbeing kind of a learning curve the\nsecond section being fast and flowy and\nwrapping around the far end\nthird section is where I start to\nquestion my life choices and say did I\nmake the right choice to ride this\nthis fourth section is the big climb\nabout 90 miles in and the final section\nbeing the home stretch\nso let's get back to the race\nthe restart with the neutral rule out\nthat led us through town and we\neventually started the race and went up\nthis huge Road climb short but very\nSteep and it led us out of town and got\nus to our first taste of gravel and it\nwas a bit bumpy and kind of fast but it\nwas a lot of fun so far and I was trying\nto kind of hold the line with this with\nthis small group here and so far it's\ndoing pretty good but I'm only a few\nmiles in so long way to go\nit didn't take long to hit the first\ndownhill section and this was fast it\nwas loose and rough and bumpy and I was\nwatching these guys on gravel bikes\nslide out in front of me there's a\ncouple of photographers catching people\ncoming through here which made me think\nthis is probably a rough little section\nbut it didn't slow anybody down except\nfor the few people that wrecked and the\nphotographers got some good shots of\nthem\nat this point I just tried to settle in\nwith this small group of guys and watch\nhow they were riding and kind of follow\ntheir lines and see how hard they were\npushing it this early in the race I felt\nlike I had pushed it a little too hard\nprobably already because we're only a\nfew miles in at this point but my legs\nare feeling great but my heart rate not\nso much it's been sitting at like 150\nwhich is not sustainable for a race like\nthis\nI'm not really sure why my heart rate's\nbeen so high at this point I mean it did\npush a little hard but we've had plenty\nof recovery areas like this downhill and\nI'm a little nervous like maybe I'm not\nfeeling good or something but could have\nbeen nerves I'm not really sure but this\ncontinued to be a problem through the\nrace\nthe race took us out through the silver\nIsland Scenic back way and this was\nspectacular like it is so beautiful out\nthere especially if you love rocks and\nmountains and you can see the you know\nthe mountains on your left and the Salt\nFlats on your right is just incredible I\nlove this section\nthis eventually led us to aid station\nnumber one about 17 miles in I\nunfortunately forgot to film it but\nyou'll see it later because it's also\nage station number three\nbut I did catch up with these guys\nleaving the Aid Station and this led us\nto this descent down silver Island pass\nthis was a fast one it was Rowdy it's\nhard to tell from the video but I almost\nlost it watch what happens to this\ngravel biker that comes up alongside of\nme I don't know how he held on it\ndoesn't look as bad in the video but I\nthought he was going down he was all\nover the place because we were moving\npretty quick\nat the bottom of the Descent was the\nsplit for the 65 and 100 mile races\nto the left was for the 65 milers which\nwe'd hit later and to the right was for\nthe 100 milers and this kind of let us\nout into the middle of nowhere on the\nback side of the silver Island mountains\nthis section of the race was so much fun\nI felt like I was just absolutely flying\nlike averaging 17 and 19 miles an hour\non a mountain bike which is kind of\ncrazy especially on dirt and I\neventually did have to start climbing\nagain and caught up with a couple people\nI had been by myself for quite a while\nmyself pretty hard to try to keep up\nwith these three guys in front of me\nthey were moving pretty quick and I had\nseen him a few times earlier in the race\nand tried to catch up with them but just\ncouldn't quite hang on to them but as\nsoon as we started climbing I actually\ncaught him and it was kind of nice to be\nwith some people on this climb\nthis climb took us up to Aid Station 2\nwhich was a water only aid station but\nman I really needed it I needed a bottle\nrefill before the next section of the\nrace it was so nice to get some fresh\nwater in me I chugged a bottle of water\nrefilled my bottles and was out of there\nI didn't hang around too long\nafter leaving the Aid Station I\ndescended down Hastings cut off towards\nthe front side of the silver Island\nmountains and started heading west back\ntowards Wendover this was a really fun\nsection it was nice and fast in spots\nand kind of flowy there was a slight bit\nof headwind and some chunky sections\nlike you're seeing here but all in all\nit was pretty smooth and fast rolling\ncaught up with a few Riders and actually\nhad some people to ride with for a while\nwhich was nice passed a couple of cars\nand everybody was super nice and pulled\nover to get out of the way\nbut most of it was nice and flat and\nrolling until we got to this unexpected\nclimb so you can kind of see the climb\nhere ahead of me doesn't look like much\non video but it was enough to burn my\nlegs up I was pushing over 300 close to\n400 watts to get up to the top of it and\nI was definitely sweating\nand shortly after that you kind of\nrolled for a minute and then got to this\nlittle sucker which was a very Punchy\nsteep climb could have got up at seated\nbut I decided to stand up and just push\nover to the top this one caught me off\nguard as well but so far so good like my\nlegs are feeling good my heart rate was\ncoming down a little bit and I was\nstarting to really settle in but still\nhad a long way to go I think I was a\nlittle over 50 miles at this point\nbeing slightly higher in elevation at\nthis point I could really see just how\nfar ahead ahead of me to go before I\nreach the next aid station and I\nrealized like I really need to focus on\nmy pacing strategy I had been the whole\nrace but I needed to kind of slow down\nand regroup and think through things\nmake sure like my food intake was going\nwell that I was getting enough fluids\nand that I was going to be able to\nsurvive this race I was feeling good but\nI knew I had a long way to go and this\nwas my first taste of a little bit of a\nheadwind so like I needed to kind of see\nhow I was reacting how much it was\nslowing me down and whether or not I\ncould continue on at the pace I was\ncontinuing on with\nI finally reached Stage Station number\nthree and this was a crucial stop for me\nI had a big list of things I needed to\nget done I had to clean and lube my\nchain I needed to use the restroom and\nthankfully they had a portal at there I\nswapped GoPro batteries I reloaded food\ninto my top tube bag I drank a full\nbottle of water and then refilled all of\nmy bottles and the full stop was around\nfive minutes which I was super happy\nwith because I thought it was going to\ntake me a lot longer so I got out of\nthere as soon as I could and headed back\ndown the silver Island pass for the\nsecond time this was that sketchy spot\nwhere the gravel cyclist just about went\ndown next to me\nthis time when I reached the bottom of\nthe pass I took a left instead of a\nright this is where the 65 milers went\nearlier in the morning and now it was\nour turn and this was where I knew it\nwas going to suck I had felt great up to\nthis point but all of a sudden I was in\na strong headwind with a slight climb\nahead of me and ran into all this deep\nsand and my speed went from like 15 to\n16 miles an hour down to about five and\nparts I even had to walk because it was\njust so ridiculous like people did ride\nit but I can't imagine the amount of\npower that you burnt trying to get\nthrough here\nthis section of the course also had a\nnumber of wash Crossings like this one\nit was super rough the sand was probably\nsix inches deep in the bottom and it\njust wanted to wash your front wheel out\nand you could see like right here I just\nabout went down and a number of other\npeople I'm sure lost it there\nmanaged to Pedal through pretty much all\nthe sand up into this point and my legs\nwere just screaming and I saw this guy\nkind of standing there taking a break\nand I tried and tried to Pedal through\nand eventually just succumbed to the\nsand it was just so deep here it was\nhard to walk in and I just had to push\nmy way through\ncame to an end when I rolled into the\nnext stage station\nI could have been more thankful to\nfinally make it here this section of the\ncourse was the hardest section of the\nentire course and I wouldn't know that\nuntil later after I had done the big\nclimb I thought the upcoming climb was\ngoing to be the hardest part but it\nreally wasn't it was the part before\nthat aid station\nafter leaving the Aid Station I got some\nmuch needed recovery time on a long\npaved downhill it was so nice to just be\non some smooth Road for a little bit and\nkind of let everything recover I would\ncross back over into Nevada and that's\nwhen things got nasty I hit this road\nsection A gravel road section at about\n30 miles an hour and it was some of the\nworst washboard I have ever ridden in my\nlife it just rattled my teeth and my\nbrain and was so bad eventually I had to\njust slow down and open up my suspension\nbecause I just couldn't take it anymore\nand this went on for like five or six\nmiles it felt like an eternity\nback off into the desert and this is\nwhere it was hard but it really wasn't\nanything specific that was hard it was\njust like it was getting late in the\nrace and there was a very very long low\nangle sustained climb for like the next\ntwo hours it was such a long like\narduous task just to get through this\npart you know it it wasn't like it was\nterrible or anything it was definitely\nnot as hard as the prior section but it\nwas hard enough to where it just really\nlike strained my mental capabilities to\nhandle something like this\neventually I rolled up on the first of\nthe two final climbs this climb I'm not\nexactly sure how many miles it was it\nfelt like forever it was a low angle\nclimb maybe like three four percent with\na couple little Punchy spots like this\nbut it kept having these false Flats\nwhere you would think you got up to the\ntop almost like a false Summit on a hike\nbut you weren't actually at the top and\nyou Crest over and be like oh my gosh\nI've got another three miles to the next\nmaybe Summit and it just like really\nwore on me mentally but I tried to focus\non my fueling and water and making sure\nI was ready for this climb this was the\nstart of the final big climb so this is\nlike 80 some 88 miles in maybe and it\ncompletely changed the course you can\nsee how much rougher and rockier it is\nand it's hard to get a scope of like how\nsteep this was but like my mountain\nbiking skills really came in here\nbecause I just just crushed it up this I\nsoared past a bunch of people and just\nlike I felt like I killed it going up\nwhich I was shocked I was waiting all\nday for how bad this was going to be and\nI felt like I just really killed it\nfor as good as I was going up the\nmountain unfortunately this is where I\nhad my first mechanical failure of the\nrace and thankfully it was just my Wahoo\nelement bike computer it had been\nbeeping and had been beeping a lot\nduring the race trying to tell me that I\nwasn't quite on the path because it the\nGPS was just a little bit off for some\nreason in certain spots and I thought it\nwas doing that again here but what it\nwas actually telling me was that the\nbattery was dying so as I was cresting\nthis climb and just you know patting\nmyself on the back for how well I did my\nGPS unit died which then I needed like I\ndidn't want to lose this race and lose\nthe record of it so I had to stop\neventually when I got to the top and you\nknow kind of figure out what happened\nand get my external battery pack hooked\nup to it and start recharging the head\nunit which thankfully it was able to\nrecover the ride that's like a super\nawesome feature from all who I'm so glad\nthey put that in there but I did lose\nabout a maybe mile and a half or two\nMile Stretch while it was trying to\npower itself back on and recover the\nride\nonce I reached the top of the main big\nclimb of the race I had some traversing\nto do to get across this kind of pseudo\nRidge line and that was going to take us\nto kind of the final downhill of the\nwhole entire race so I spent some time\nhere fueling again like eating a couple\nextra bars eating some Cliff blocks and\nreally trying to let my body recover so\nthat I could recover even further on the\ndownhill and be ready for the final\npedaly section back into town\nthis section was a lot of fun it was\nkind of flowy and fast had some chunky\nspots some deep sand kind of kept you\nunder toes a little bit but it was all\nin all like a good kind of recovery spot\nafter that big climb and I knew there\nwas going to be quite a bit of downhill\ncoming\nI finally started on The Descent down to\nthe final aid station this was kind of\nmy last chance to decide what I needed\nfor the rest of the race if I wanted to\ngrab some food if I needed to switch\nanything over refill bags refill bottles\nwhatever it might be so my brain was\nkind of racing at this point like what\ndo I need how much further do I have to\ngo how much harder is this gonna this\nlast section of the race going to be you\nknow can I get by with just a real quick\nstop here do I need to stop longer and I\nfinally decided as I hit the pavement\nthat I'm going to make this one quick I\nfelt like I was moving pretty quick it's\nup to this point and I wanted to keep my\nmy speed up and my time down so I\ndecided just to make a quick water stop\npavement was short-lived and we quickly\nheaded back into the desert and I was\nkind of confused about where I actually\nwas at this point I thought I had to go\nfurther west the direction I'm heading\nto get to Wendover and I'm sitting here\nthinking to myself like uh where's\nWendover and how much further do we have\nto go did I miscalculate something here\nbut like this was just the late race\nbrain I guess I was getting a little\ndehydrated and I had actually passed\nwind over when I got to this final aid\nstation so Wendover was back east of me\nwhich is why I couldn't see it and oh\nyeah I hit this spot here so this was\nlike six inches of this super fine Munda\nsilt stuff\nit was definitely hike a bike for me you\ncould see a few people made it through\nthey must have hit it really fast to get\nup that there were a couple spots like\nthat but that one was really bad\nbut after I got through that I continued\npedaling on out into the desert and\neventually started wrapping around back\ntowards Wendover and I could see it way\noff in the distance so it just kind of\ngave me that like I can make it like\nI've made it this far I'm gonna make it\nto the end\nI had another short little hike a bike\nsection here there are probably about\nfive or six of these throughout the\ncourse this one was super steep and as I\nwas climbing this I felt a little twinge\nin my calves and thought Oh that feels\nlike a cramp and sure enough I was\nstarting to get just a little bit of a\ncramp in this section I think I had\npushed it just a little too hard when I\nstarted down through the desert on this\nlast part you know I was very excited\nbut I guess kept pressing on was hoping\nI was going to be able to ride it out\nand then I finally made it to this\nbridge so this bridge was like shown on\nall the promo videos for the salty\nlizard race and I couldn't figure out if\nwe were going to actually get to do it\nor not but it's super cool it's all\ntagged up and kind of a unique thing to\ngo through over in Wendover and once I\ngot through that it was back into the\ndesert once again and I kept thinking to\nmyself like man how much are we going to\nwrap around before we actually get to\nWendover I kept thinking we were heading\nto the town but we just keep going\nfurther out into the desert but I just\nkept pedaling\nthe desert Trails turned into this Old\nRoad that led us back into the town of\nWendover you can kind of see it off in\nthe distance here and this followed one\nof the main highways and it felt good to\nbe on pavement again you know I love\nriding on gravel and single track Trails\nbut every once in a while you just need\nthat smoothness to kind of let\neverything settle down again and you\nknow take some pressure off your hands\nand your in your butt so it's nice to\nget that little break and finally here\nwe are I can see part of the town like I\nI can mentally see the finish and I am\ngetting super excited at this point and\nI started pushing harder and harder and\nharder and I could feel those cramps\ncoming on in my calves but I tried to\nstay hydrated and tried to eat a little\nextra get a little sugar in me I was\njust hoping I'd be able to push through\nas I turned onto the section of Road\nI could feel the end like I knew I was\ngetting close and I was getting so\nexcited I just kept thinking to myself\nlike holy cow\nyou rode a hundred mile race and you did\nit successfully and you don't feel like\ncrap and you've kind of feel like you\ncan actually ride some more and it just\nblew my mind like I thought for sure I\nwas going to get to this point and just\nbe crawling and dying and you know\nsaying why did I do this race and\ninstead like I got a smile on my face at\nthis point and I can see the end there's\nthe airport that we started at and I got\n200 meters to go and I am just like\nthrilled I cannot believe that I was\nable to finally do this and do it\nsuccessfully and like I said you know\nnot feel like crap you know when you\nreally push your body like this and you\ntry something this hard you know\nsometimes you don't make it but this\ntime I couldn't believe how well I did I\nthink all the planning and everything\nreally paid off and here's the finish\nline\nlaughs\nI crossed it in just over eight hours I\nthink eight hours and seven minutes or\nsomething like that which funny story I\nthought it was seven hours because my\nwatch had changed times as I crossed the\nstate lines and you know oops I should\nhave known better\nthat's awesome\nthat was awesome\nare you John John you're Keith Keith\nfrom Monster yeah\nthis time it really uh favored a little\nsmaller tires but when you got in the\nchunky stuff this white kicks ass yeah\nin that last client I just sailed up\npast everybody yeah I figured you\nyou meet people with a mountain bike\nwould have\nthat yeah\nyeah and wanting to do something like\nthis about years if you ever anywhere\nnear Salt Lake reach out all right\nsounds good have a good one",

          "description": "I had the idea to start  this gravel race 5  years ago in my hometown of Wendover as it has amazing endless dirt roads. Together with Bobby and Becky we put on the race for the first time in 2020.  This is the 4th year for the Salty Lizard gravel race.   I no longer live in Wendover  but go out to visit my brother and always bring my gravel bike.  I love bringing folks out to ride with me as they are always amazed at all the seemingly endless gravel roads and wide open spaces.   I really love the Wendover desert.  Plus you can ride your gravel bike out there, typically, year round.  Thanks to  Ben who joined me on my ride.  We both live in Cache Valley and are members of the Logan Race Club.  We had a great road riding season doing many fast Tuesday Night rides and weekend  road centuries together.  This was fitting to do another century  with him this time on gravel.",

          "description": "1st Annual \"Wendover Salty Lizard 100K+ Gravel Grinder\"on Utah Nevada border.  A free event.  14 friends drove out (most from Cache Valley, 2 from Park City)  to spend a beautiful day riding in the desert. I set up a course in my old hometown of Wendover, with the first loop riding west in Nevada, including the Dead Cow Loop, (a cow had died on this loop years ago now  leaving just a scattering of bones).  This loop a bit more rocky and loose and up and down.  Then connecting into a pretty smooth dirt road, slightly downhill, I call the Pilot Peak Loop road as you ride toward 10,000 ft Pilot Peak that pierces the sky in the distance.  We will connecting back into the Dead Cow loop and back to our lunch spot at Leppy's trails   After lunch we rode East into Utah around the first portion of the Silver Island Mountains on the Silver Island Loop road.  The day of, my niece, Karen, who set up our lunch, suggested the lunch spot  be at Leppy's trail park for convenience.  That was a great suggestion but added another 10-miles to the ride, 72 miles if you rode the entire two loops with 5,500+ feet of climbing. Well worth it. Some rode enough to get  their 100K. The riders came from Northern Utah  the land of Ice and Snow our longest ride of the year.  As you can see a combination of mountain and gravel bikes were rode.  On the Dead Cow loop mountain bikes worked better but on the Pilot Peak and Silver Island loop gravel bike rolled great. We topped off the event with dinner at the Salt Flats Cafe, serving delicious Mexican food.  Mucho fun day.  Thanks to all the that participated.",

          "description": "The first Salty Lizard 100-mile gravel race in Wendover, UT/NV put on by Salty and Stupid Cycling.  There were 3 categories, 100, 65, & 45 miles.  This video highlights the 100-mile racer &, Boyd Cycles sponsored Tinker Juarez. What an honor to have this cycling legend ride the Salty Lizard. Tinker will start 8 minutes behind the leaders and will make up that time in the first 35 miles and be on a solo chase of Tanner Visnick, a pro mountain bike racer. Tanner broke away at 15 miles on a climb and will solo in for an amazing victor in 5 hours and 39 minutes.   Unfortunately for Tinker, on a 36-mile loop around the Silver Island mountains, he took a wrong road and lost valuable time.  He will still finish 4th, what an amazing athlete as he is nearing 60 years old.  Mya Dixon, a 16-year racer on the Reno Devo team out of Reno, NV, will crush it beating many of the men to win the small field of women 100-mile racer, in 6 hrs 53 minutes.  Thanks to Reno Devo race team for bringing so many of their young talented cyclists.   John Croom, a national champion track cyclist, will have a mechanical and not finish, glad to have him there too. Jeff Sumsion and Benjamin Fichialos entered the Stupid Lizard category, riding the 220-mile Stupid Pony gravel race from Eagle Mtn, UT on the Pony Express trail, on Friday. It finished at the Historic Wendover airfield.  Those two then got up to race the Salty Lizard 100 Saturday morning.  Both finished the 320 mile 2-day event, outstanding.   Thanks to all participants that came and rode/raced the first Salty Lizard Gravel event.  Watch for the 2nd Salty Lizard video which will highlight the 65- & 45-mile participants.",

        "search_text": "The Salty Lizard features a challenging early profile with a short but very steep road climb out of Wendover leading to the first gravel section. The course includes a notorious fast downhill section where gravel bikes slide out, followed by terrain that feels bumpy and fast. Aid station 1 sits at mile 17 near Silver Island pass, which features a fast and rowdy descent where riders nearly lose control. The middle section allows riders to fly at 17-19 mph on dirt through spectacular desert scenery with mountains on the left and Salt Flats on the right. The race splits at 65 and 100 mile options after the Silver Island descent. A major climbing challenge hits around mile 90 in the fourth section. Heart rate management proves critical as the early pace can spike unsustainably high. The course travels through the Silver Island Scenic back way offering beautiful desert mountain views."
