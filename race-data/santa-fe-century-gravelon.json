      "value": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Early bird at $77 climbing to $97 by race day isn't highway robbery for 55 miles of marked desert riding. You get medals, podium prizes, and they've been doing this for 40 years so they won't disappear with your entry fee. But there's a $10 onsite surcharge and registration closes Sunday before the weekend, which feels unnecessarily rigid."

      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "The race requires minimum 35mm tires, spare tubes, patch kit, pump, and tools. A pre-event bike tune-up is 'highly recommended' for the rough terrain. The 20-minute drive from Santa Fe adds modest logistics costs."
