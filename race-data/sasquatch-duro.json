More weather exposure than Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

Modest altitude compared to Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

        "explanation": "The route travels through 'rolling vineyards, lush forests, serene farmland' with a 2.8-mile neutral rollout west from Carlton before timing begins. Wine country setting provides scenic variety, though the figure-8 format means seeing terrain twice on the long course."

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Elite winners like Aris Sophocles (ThirstyBear Cycling, 3:04:14) and Mike Guyvan show some competitive depth. Part of Oregon Triple Crown Series, but the 2025 venue change from Oakridge to Carlton represents a significant shift from the event's logging road heritage."

        "explanation": "Live music runs 12:00-3:30pm in Ladd Park with awards at 2pm and 2:45pm for short and long courses. Carlton's 'nearly two dozen wine tasting rooms' and farm-to-table dining create proper post-race atmosphere in Oregon's wine capital setting."

        "explanation": "Dan Shryock notes the event attracts 'both competitive bike racers and casual riders who are more interested in the experience than speed.' $14 food vouchers for local Carlton businesses and custom event socks show investment in rider experience and local partnerships."
      },

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "With a field of 100-250 riders, results show competitive riders like Edward Dudlik (Dialed Cycling Team) and Nicholas North winning age group categories. Elite categories exist with team-sponsored riders, but the field lacks notable national-level gravel racers or significant prize money to attract top talent. Less competitive depth than Almanzo 100."

      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Registration runs $80-100. Carlton's wine country location means bed and breakfasts rather than budget motels, though McMinnville 15 minutes away offers more lodging options. E-bike allowance (Class 1 and 3, maximum 50 participants) shows adaptation to broader rider demographics and equipment trends. Similar expense level to Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

The course has a high point at 4,400 feet and includes strategic climbs early in the race for breaking up groups. A key feature is the Sasquatch Monster Split at mile 31, described by race promoters as where the race gets interesting. The terrain allows for fast riding on fire roads with Kenda Alluvium Pro 35mm tires proving effective. The final downhill section enables rapid passing of other riders. Race conditions often include Oregon rain, adding to the challenge. With 260 riders registered, the event draws significant participation. The course rewards tactical climbing and gap management skills due to limited visibility between competitors."
