        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "The 62-mile course delivers 5,000 feet through rolling wine country terrain described as 'mellow climbs and fun descents.' This represents substantial climbing density that rewards fitness while remaining accessible to cross bike setups in Carlton's hilly landscape."

      "climate": {

        "explanation": "Mid-April in Oregon's Willamette Valley creates typical Pacific Northwest spring weather uncertainty. No specific weather data available, but the event was cancelled in 2024 due to fire danger at the previous Oakridge location, indicating weather can impact operations."

      "altitude": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Carlton sits in Willamette Valley at relatively low elevation where altitude isn't a performance factor. The figure-8 route through vineyards and farmland operates at elevations that won't affect sea level riders or provide mountain dwellers any advantage."

        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "The route travels through 'rolling vineyards, lush forests, serene farmland' with a 2.8-mile neutral rollout west from Carlton before timing begins. Wine country setting provides scenic variety, though the figure-8 format means seeing terrain twice on the long course."

      "prestige": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Elite winners like Aris Sophocles (ThirstyBear Cycling, 3:04:14) and Mike Guyvan show some competitive depth. Part of Oregon Triple Crown Series, but the 2025 venue change from Oakridge to Carlton represents a significant shift from the event's logging road heritage."

        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Three aid stations at miles 18, 30, and 46 provide adequate support with PB&J, cookies, and Hammer Nutrition products. The mass start with neutral rollout prevents parking lot chaos, and awards go three deep in age groups with custom trophies."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Live music runs 12:00-3:30pm in Ladd Park with awards at 2pm and 2:45pm for short and long courses. Carlton's 'nearly two dozen wine tasting rooms' and farm-to-table dining create proper post-race atmosphere in Oregon's wine capital setting."
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Dan Shryock notes the event attracts 'both competitive bike racers and casual riders who are more interested in the experience than speed.' $14 food vouchers for local Carlton businesses and custom event socks show investment in rider experience and local partnerships."
      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Results show competitive riders like Edward Dudlik (Dialed Cycling Team) and Nicholas North winning age group categories. Elite categories exist with team-sponsored riders, but the field lacks notable national-level gravel racers or significant prize money to attract top talent."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Registration at $145 includes custom event socks, aid station support, and $14 food voucher for Carlton businesses. Awards three deep in all age groups with custom pint glasses and trophies represent solid value for a regional wine country event."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Carlton's wine country location means bed and breakfasts rather than budget motels, though McMinnville 15 minutes away offers more lodging options. E-bike allowance (Class 1 and 3, maximum 50 participants) shows adaptation to broader rider demographics and equipment trends."
