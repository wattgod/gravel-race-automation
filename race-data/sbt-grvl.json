The champagne gravel is real, the community is genuine, and the experience is worth the effort. Just don't expect your sea-level numbers to mean anything above 6,700 feet.",

The 2026 return to downtown Steamboat with new courses represents a fresh chapter. Go in with eyes open about altitude impact and you'll have an unforgettable day on some of America's best gravel.",
      "alternatives": "If you want Colorado without the lottery: Crusher in the Tushar (Utah, but similar vibe). If you want premier gravel without altitude: Unbound or Mid South. If you want altitude prep: Leadville 100 MTB is the ultimate altitude test."
