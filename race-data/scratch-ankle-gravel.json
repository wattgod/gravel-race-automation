      "length": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Multiple distance options from 20 to 200 miles with staggered wave starts spread the field across categories. The 45-mile distance sits in the shorter range, providing moderate challenge without the commitment of century-plus distances. More compact than Grinduro."

      "elevation": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Rolling terrain through Florida Panhandle produces minimal elevation gain relative to other gravel destinations. The moderate sustained climbs mentioned reflect what's possible in a region where significant vertical simply doesn't exist. Flatter profile than Croatan Buck Fifty."

Spring conditions in humid Florida Panhandle remain unpredictable for temperature and precipitation during race season. More weather exposure than Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

      "altitude": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Starting at Bear Lake Road in Milton, Florida places riders essentially at sea level in the coastal Panhandle. The course maintains negligible altitude throughout the forest route into Alabama. Lower altitude than Gravel Worlds — no thin-air concerns."
      },
      "adventure": {
        "score": 2,

      "prestige": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Marketed as 'one of the Southeast's most distinctive gravel racing experiences' but lacks notable past winners or media coverage. The race supports local trail maintenance, providing community benefit without national recognition."
      },
      "race_quality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Includes timing, aid stations, SAG support, finisher medals, and post-ride meal with staggered wave starts for different distances. Basic race infrastructure exists though organizational details like packet pickup remain vague until closer to race date."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Weekend format encourages camping at Bear Lake Campground for forest immersion rather than single-day racing. The tagline 'GRAVEL IS WHERE WE CONNECT' reflects community focus with families encouraged to camp and explore."
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 2,

      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "With a field of 75-125 riders, regional-level competition focused on Florida Panhandle and Gulf Coast participants without national talent draw. Field size details unavailable, though multiple distance options suggest moderate participation levels. Thinner field than Ouray Gravel Grinder."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Entry includes timing, post-ride meal, event shirt, finisher medal, aid stations, SAG support, and photos for reasonable pricing. Price increases February 22nd but starts from affordable base in low-cost rural area."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Registration runs $60-80. Milton, Florida location keeps lodging and dining costs minimal with Bear Lake Campground providing affordable weekend accommodation. Rural Panhandle setting eliminates premium pricing found in major gravel destinations. Similar expense level to Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."
