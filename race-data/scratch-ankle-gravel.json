        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Multiple distance options from 20 to 200 miles with staggered wave starts spread the field across categories. The 45-mile distance sits in the shorter range, providing moderate challenge without the commitment of century-plus distances."

      "elevation": {
        "score": 1,

      "altitude": {
        "score": 1,

      "adventure": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Route through Blackwater River State Forest and into Conecuh National Forest provides longleaf pine ecosystem immersion away from urban development. The natural setting offers scenic forest riding with camping opportunities at Bear Lake."

      "prestige": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Marketed as 'one of the Southeast's most distinctive gravel racing experiences' but lacks notable past winners or media coverage. The race supports local trail maintenance, providing community benefit without national recognition."
      },
      "race_quality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Includes timing, aid stations, SAG support, finisher medals, and post-ride meal with staggered wave starts for different distances. Basic race infrastructure exists though organizational details like packet pickup remain vague until closer to race date."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Weekend format encourages camping at Bear Lake Campground for forest immersion rather than single-day racing. The tagline 'GRAVEL IS WHERE WE CONNECT' reflects community focus with families encouraged to camp and explore."
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Race promotes community connection and supports local trail maintenance through participation. Registration opened October 19, 2024 for 2025, showing established annual tradition with trail advocacy mission."
      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Regional-level competition focused on Florida Panhandle and Gulf Coast participants without national talent draw. Field size details unavailable, though multiple distance options suggest moderate participation levels."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Entry includes timing, post-ride meal, event shirt, finisher medal, aid stations, SAG support, and photos for reasonable pricing. Price increases February 22nd but starts from affordable base in low-cost rural area."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Milton, Florida location keeps lodging and dining costs minimal with Bear Lake Campground providing affordable weekend accommodation. Rural Panhandle setting eliminates premium pricing found in major gravel destinations."
