Part of a massive festival with 64,000 visitors and 402+ exhibiting brands, but no specifics on parking or packet pickup logistics."

Nicole Frain went solo at halfway and held her gap, while the men's race stayed together until a sprint finish with just 1 second separating first and second. Similar distance to Crusher in the Tushar."
      },

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Nicole Frain described the course as 'rough, hot, rocky' with technical descents after the major climb to Puig d'Arques. The terrain combines wide flat tracks through rural areas with rolling hills, but the early selection on climbs rather than technical sections suggests it's more about power than handling skills. Less technical than The Mid South."

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "1,828m over 107km includes a decisive first climb where Esmée Peperkamp 'set a savage pace' that immediately split the field. The major climb to Puig d'Arques at halfway reaches 409m elevation, with two consecutive climbs between km 41-48 providing the hardest section before a technical descent. Less climbing than The Mid South."

      "climate": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "September in Girona typically delivers solid conditions - warm but not scorching, minimal rain risk compared to spring races. The Costa Brava location gets 'good weather' according to tourism data, though that's marketing speak without specifics on temperature or wind patterns. No historical weather disasters in the research, which either means conditions are reliably decent or the race is too new to have weathered any storms. Similar climate challenges to SBT GRVL.

      "altitude": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Peak elevation of just 409m in the Les Gavarres massif near coastal Girona means altitude never factors into performance. Even the highest point at Puig d'Arques keeps you in the lowlands throughout the race. Lower altitude than Gravel Worlds — no thin-air concerns."
      },
      "adventure": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Les Gavarres massif offers exploration through rural Catalonia, not just another gravel circuit around a parking lot. The route from Juià through varied terrain to Girona takes you through authentic countryside with technical descents and rolling hills. It's real adventure riding, though the festival atmosphere and crowds might dilute that sense of discovery you get from truly remote gravel events."
      },
      "prestige": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Second year as a UCI Gravel World Series qualifier and the last chance before Worlds gets you noticed, but it's still finding its footing in the gravel hierarchy. Being part of the Sea Otter Europe circus with 65,000 visitors gives it festival credibility, though that's more industry networking than pure racing pedigree. It's riding on borrowed prestige from the California mothership rather than building its own legend in Girona's hills."
      },
      "race_quality": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "The course design delivered tactical racing - early selection on the first climb, solo breakaways holding to the line in the women's race, and a sprint finish deciding the men's race by one second. Daan Soete called it 'a race of nerves and timing' that came down to 'pure speed at the end.'"
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "You're racing through Catalonian countryside in Les Gavarres, not some fabricated gravel theme park. The festival atmosphere with 6,000+ riders creates energy, but also potential for overcrowding and amateur hour logistics. Starting in Juià and finishing at Girona's exhibition center gives you real terrain bookended by festival mayhem - whether that enhances or detracts from your race depends on what you came for."
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "The Sea Otter Europe festival has become 'a necessary and must-attend event for the cycling community' in just seven editions, drawing 64,000 visitors and 6,000+ participating riders. The festival combines elite racing with industry expo, creating what organizers call 'worldwide recognition among the cycling industry and cycling enthusiasts.'"
      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "UCI World Series qualifier status pulls riders hunting for Worlds spots, especially since it's the last chance on the calendar. Problem is the research shows zero data on who actually shows up or past results, which either means the field isn't noteworthy or the race is too new to matter. 6,000+ riders sounds impressive until you realize most are festival tourists, not serious racers. Similar competitive depth to Rule of Three."

The package includes both the race experience and industry expo access in Girona's cycling-focused environment."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Registration runs €60-90. Girona during festival weekend means 64,000 visitors competing for accommodations in a city known as cycling tourism central. The festival's massive draw creates the classic supply-demand squeeze on hotels and restaurants, though the region offers 'good gastronomy' according to local promotion. Higher total cost than Badlands."
