The three-lap format offers 30, 60, or 90 miles, but compared to Unbound's 200-mile standard, Sea Otter prioritizes accessibility over endurance challenges. More compact than Grinduro."

The 0.25-mile Lookout Ridge singletrack averages 15.5% grade but they've eliminated the hike-a-bike sections from early editions. Similar technical demands to Gravel Worlds."

        "explanation": "Each 30-mile lap delivers 2,700 feet of climbing according to rider reports, totaling over 8,000 feet across 90 miles. The Laguna Seca loop includes \"two 3-4 minute climbs peaking at 12%\" that challenged even road-trained riders. Keegan Swenson knew \"the last climb was where the race was going to be won or lost\" on every lap. Similar elevation profile to Gravel Worlds."

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "The 2025 race featured \"a pretty warm day\" that caught Steph Hart unprepared with only two bottles, forcing a refill stop at 50 miles. April in Monterey averages 62°F highs with potential marine layer and fog. The coastal conditions never quite warm up despite decent sunshine hours, making hydration planning critical. More weather exposure than Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Starting at WeatherTech Raceway Laguna Seca puts you essentially at sea level with Fort Ord's highest points barely registering altitude effects. Monterey Peninsula geography means you're racing in thick coastal air the entire time. Zero acclimatization concerns, but also zero altitude training benefits. Lower altitude than Gravel Worlds — no thin-air concerns."

        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "The Start Section requires climbing \"out of the racetrack and onto half a mile of single track, then a fast but loose 3 mile descent.\" Racing through Fort Ord National Monument where 1.5 million troops trained for Vietnam adds historical weight. The opening descent from Laguna Seca into protected monument backcountry creates adventure within festival structure."

        "explanation": "Olympic silver medalist Haley Batten won her first-ever gravel race here, while Keegan Swenson claimed his fourth consecutive Sea Otter victory. As Life Time Grand Prix Race #1, it draws the sport's biggest names to Fort Ord. Being part of cycling's largest festival with 74,000 fans and serving as an official UNBOUND qualifier puts this in the top tier."

Course runs through 14,000 acres of Fort Ord National Monument managed by BLM. After early editions that were too technical, they've created fast, flowing gravel that rewards fitness over pure bike handling."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 5,
        "explanation": "Simon Pellaud noted \"Sea Otter is much more than just a gravel race — it's a true cycling festival. All the brands are there on-site at Laguna Seca.\" You're racing where American troops trained for Vietnam, now a sanctuary for 44 rare species. The post-race meal at Casa Amigos Rider Lounge and massive expo create a complete cycling experience."
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 5,
        "explanation": "Ten thousand athletes across 14 disciplines creates cycling's biggest gathering. Pellaud met sponsors after racing: \"finally 'put faces to the names' of the people who have supported me for years.\" The spectator-friendly Laguna Seca sections provide \"well suited\" heckling opportunities that riders find \"at least a little entertaining.\" Mix of gravel newbies and Olympic athletes creates the full spectrum."

Elite-level competition, on par with Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Registration includes 4-day festival pass, parking, post-race meal, and UNBOUND qualifying opportunity. Pellaud benefited from meeting sponsors and accessing the massive expo with hundreds of brands. However, one rider questioned \"why I took a day of PTO and paid $175 to do this race\" during challenging moments, plus Monterey accommodation costs surge during Sea Otter weekend."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Monterey in April means hotel rates surge during cycling's biggest festival weekend, requiring early booking. However, the 4-day pass spreads costs across multiple events, and free bike demos from hundreds of brands provide serious value for gear shopping. United Airlines offers meeting discounts, while Groome Transportation provides $10 off airport shuttles when mentioning Sea Otter. More affordable than Crusher in the Tushar."

          "transcript": "I'm Bill Ellison and welcome to the 35th\nLifetime Sea Otter Classic presented by\nContinental. We are live from the Laguna\nSecika Raceway getting ready to kick off\nthe fourth year of the Lifetime Grand\nPrix. It's the first of six brutal stops\nin the series, bringing endurance,\nskill, and strategy to the line. All\nwith\n$380,000 in prize money on the\nline. Big changes for 2025 in store. Sea\nOtter moving from a mountain bike race\nto a gravel race this year, shaking up\nour series right from the start. And of\ncourse, if you see behind me, you see\nthe fog socking in the Laguna Secika\nRaceway here. It's pretty cool this\nmorning. We anticipate things warming up\na little bit and hopefully the fog\nstarting to burn off a little bit later\non. Tim, tell me what you think. What do\nyou think about our course out here\ntoday? Well, there's a lot of changes in\n2025, you know, with uh the switching\nfrom mountain biking. Uh so, for the\nfirst time, the Lifetime Grand Prix\nracers will take on a gravel race here\nat Sea Otter. So, that's a huge change.\nWell, let's talk about some of the\nriders. We've got a lot of great riders\nto watch out here. We've got returning\nchampions. We've got a lot of new riders\nin the mix. Who can we expect to shine\nout here on our new gravel course? Well,\nat least on the men's side, you know,\nthere's no one to really talk about as\nan overall favorite except for Keegan\nSwinson. He's been the winningest rider\nin the Lifetime Grand Prix, three-time\noverall champion, and he lines up today\nas the race favorite. Uh however, you\nknow, the fight for the podium last year\nreally brought Matthew Beers from South\nAfrica um as one of his major\ncontenders. Uh big power, strong rider.\nUh and Pac Mavane had the best overall\nfinish of his career in third last year.\nUm so those are my favorites on the\nmen's side. Lauren, what are you\nthinking? For the women for sure, you\nhave to look at Sophia Visha coming\nback, winning hand in hand again. Haley\nSmith was uh fourth here last year and\neveryone's knocking on the door really\ntrying to knock Sophia off that top step\nstep. We've also got a new course out\nhere this year. Of course, we've now\ngravel. We've been mountain bike\nhistorically here at Sea Otter. So, a\nbig change with a gravel event, Tim.\nWhat are what's some of this course like\nthis year? What's the new things that we\ncan expect? So, we're here in Northern\nCalifornia, right on the ocean, and uh\nthis is Laguna Secika Raceway, which is\na famous motorcycle and car racing\ntrack. Uh this start line is really\nfamiliar to a lot of the riders. It's an\nexpo filled with thousands of people. Uh\nbut this is all about how this course is\ngoing to ride. A huge fast descent to\nkick it off before heading into the kind\nof meat and potatoes of the race. Short\nclimbs, really intense. again talking to\na lot of the riders yesterday when they\nwere previewing the course and it's that\nfirst descent that a lot of them are\ngoing to be really nervous and keyed in\non as they then go out on course and\nthen coming back on Barlloy Canyon Road\nalso with Lookout uh Ridge again another\nkey factor of the race 2.7 miles steep\nfast fun and exciting racing all day\ntoday. Well, you snuck right past that\nsingle track section at the beginning of\nLookout. Um, and that's really the most\ntechnical part of the course before\ngetting into the finish line where\nhopefully we've got a group. You know,\nit'd be great to see a sprint finish in\na gravel race like this before dropping\nback into Laguna Secika is actually\ngoing to be a 180 turn with just 200\nmeters to the finish line. I mean, you\ngot to be first out of that corner to be\nable to put your hands up at the finish.\nWell, we've got a new few key components\nthis year to the series. The first of\nwhich is the wild card. So, we've got uh\n44 athletes in total in the series. 22\nmen, 22 women. But with the wild card,\nwe're going to add some riders as the\nseries progresses. Walk us through a\nlittle bit about what that means with\nthe wild card. Yeah, so the wild card is\ngreat because it really gives a chance\nfor riders who are fighting for those\nfinal spots in the series. You know, we\naccepted 22 riders this year instead of\n25. uh to be able to save those last\nthree spots for the riders who come out\nof the blocks hard, do well at Sea\nOtter, do well at Unbound, and then\nthey're brought into the series with the\npoints that they've earned. So, all of a\nsudden, we've got a shake up in the\nstandings. I think it's going to be\ngreat for the fans and good for the\nriders. So, Lauren, we've also got\nanother key component this year. That's\nour under 23 category, and that's great\nbecause it's going to kind of present us\nwith a different scenario of a race\nwithin a race out there. So, tell us a\nlittle bit more about this new under 23\ndivision. I absolutely love this U23\nprogram happening here. We have so many\ndynamic races within the race like\nyou're talking about, Bill. And you have\nsomeone in the women's side like Ruth\nHulcom. She is a stellar mountain biker\ncoming over doing the lifetime trying to\nget her hand right in there. And uh this\nis just another race to follow and going\nto be a lot of fun and very animated.\nTim. Yeah. No, I wish um you know having\nthe chance to be able to climb the\nladder in professional cycling is really\nimportant. uh the lifetime Grand Prix is\nreally the the worldass gravel series of\nyou know out there and uh everyone wants\na chance to get into the series. So the\nwinner of that category will get a spot\nin the 2026 series. So huge prize up for\ngrabs. Hey guys, I'm here with Paige\nOnweller just for a quick question. I\nknow you're warming up. Last year you\nwere broken at this race. You're coming\nback good good form. How are you\nfeeling? How are you expecting for the\nday? Yeah, I'm super pumped to be here.\nUm, you know, when you're injured last\nyear, uh, you really miss it. So, just\nbeing here is a huge blessing and a lot\nof gratitude to line up. Uh, new course,\na lot on the line, uh, with the format\nchanges this year. So, yeah, I'm just\nexcited to see how it pans out and saw\nthe long season ahead. So, it's good\nbenchmark to kind of sus out where\neveryone's at and go from there. So,\nyeah. Awesome, Paige. Thank you so much.\nHave a great warm-up. Good luck. I think\nit's going to be key. Being a veteran or\na newcomer, are you learning on the go\nor do you have your game down? So, can't\nwait to see what's going to happen out\nthere.\nWe are underway, ladies and gentlemen.\nMake a little noise. 2025 Lifetime Grand\nPrix starts right now in our lead on the\ncourse.\n[Music]\nI I can't wait to see what's happening\nup there. Attacking, getting into that\nfirst descent in the right position.\nThis is like a a spring classic here in\nNorthern California. If you're not in\nthe front third, your race could be\nover. It's going to be a long day. Yeah,\nI remember watching Lexi Vermuan just\nattack like crazy last year to try to\nget up there on a mountain bike. Now\nthat everyone's on a gravel bike, you\nknow, it's it's just a different ball\ngame. Tactics are really going to come\ninto play throughout the day. Um, do you\ndo you burn your matches now to be safer\nlater to stay in the race? Um, do you\nget caught out by by a crash or\nsomething like that? And and the gravel\nis pretty sketchy with the ruts. There\nare holes in there. The erosion that\nthis course sees throughout the year. Oh\nman. And you know, the sun has just\npopped out like perfect timing. Just the\nstart of our men's race and I can't wait\nfor the start of the women's race.\nI'm just so excited. I cannot explain\nhow excited I am right now. I'll tell\nI'm glad I'm not racing anymore, but\nthis is as close as I can get. I suck at\nthat. Believe me, I suck at that. Having\nall the fans out here, having the expo\nright behind us, like there's so much to\nsee here at Sea Otter at the Laguna\nSecika track. It's just like the\ncorkcrew. It's just like everything\nright now. It's like the Super Bowl of\nbike racing.\n[Applause]\nThe formalities are all done for the\nmorning. Everyone is on the line here\nanticipating the start of the 2025\nLifetime Grand Prix here at the Sea\nOtter Classic. The women all ready to\ngo. And I'll tell you, it is going to be\na great season. Remember, we are\nstarting off with a whole new dynamic.\nIt is gravel racing starting off the\nGrand Prix this year, and that is\nguaranteed to bring a whole new element\nto the way the season unfolds. And by\nand large, all the feedback we've gotten\nthis week so far has been thumbs up\nabout this new gravel course here. Three\nlaps, 30 m, nearly 10,000 ft of\nelevation. Getting ready to start right\nnow in 3 2 1. Lifetime Grand Prix 2025\nwomen are officially underway. And it is\ngoing to be a big sprint around this\nfirst corner as they head up the paveill\non the track here. Everyone has done\ntheir recon. They know that first\ntechnical element is going to be coming\nup very shortly. They all want to fight\nto be in the front in that section. So,\nit is going to be a raging battle right\nfrom the start.\nThis is Bill. We are here live on the\nmain stage of the Lifetime Sea Otter\nClassic. We are a little over probably\nabout 18 19 mi into our elite men's race\nright now. What it's looking like is a\npretty substantial lead group. Looks\nlike we've got actually they've just\ncrossed through the 22 mile checkpoint.\nSo fresh update right here for you. So\nyou see one of our riders having a\nlittle bit of a mechanical trying to\nidentify who that rider is. That looks\nlike it's Pacing Mckelvin uh in that\nfresh new Allied having just a little\nbit of a problem on his bike. He was\nstopped. He was off the bike. Little bit\nslow going now as we try and figure out\nwhat's going on. But it looks like he\nmay be losing contact with that lead\ngroup right now. Uh Keegan Swenson, one\nof our main riders, of course, your\ndefending champion, notably about 10\nseconds behind this lead group right now\nalong with Matt Beers. So, and uh Peter\nVakh is kind leading the cruise through.\nWe've got a number of riders in that\ngroup. Looking down, it looks like we've\ngot about uh 13 riders in that front\ngroup. A lot of the hitters that you\nmight expect in that group. Toby Road up\nnear the front end of that. The French\nrider Hugo Dash. The check Peter Vhock\nleading the group though. They're still\nrunning a heavy 20 m an hour. Remember\nour last time check they were up around\n23 m an hour. So obviously the they're\ngetting to that deeper portion of the\ncourse. They've got a lot of uphill as\nthey run through. So, that pace starting\nto come down just a little bit as the\ncamera really backs out to get that big\nview. But what we do know is we've got\nabout 13 riders in that front group\nright now. They're very quickly closing\nin on the tail end of lap number one of\nthree. We are back from the main stage\nwith an update from our women's\nstandings here in the Lifetime Grand\nPrix. Round number one and the big\nshakeup going on right now. We've got\none rider off the front with a 202 gap.\nThat is one of our new riders to the\nGrand Prix. That is Excel Dubau Provo,\nthe French rider from Europe. Her first\ntime in the Grand Prix. And I tell you\nwhat, she means business. She's got a 20\nsecond gap right now over a huge chase\ngroup. Looks like we've got about 25\nriders or so in that chase group. 20 21\nseconds behind that group being led\nthrough that second time split at 15\nmiles by Courtney Sherwell. You got\nWhitney Allison in there, Emily Nuome,\nCecile Lun, Caroline Resin, of course,\nlast year's champion Sophia Gomez, Visha\namong others. So, right now, the French\nrider, the new rider to the Grand Prix,\nabsolutely throwing caution to the wind\nonly 15 miles into this 90m race. She's\ngot a 20 second gap. We're looking back\nat the rest of the women's field right\nnow and they are kind of spread out a\nbit shoulder-to-shoulder. Nobody's\nreally chasing some interesting dynamics\ngoing on right now. 20 second gap over\nabout 20 or 25 riders. Hey everybody,\nTim Johnson here just at the top of\nLookout Ridge and uh I just witnessed it\nsuch a brutal acceleration right at the\nbase of this thing. It was a group of\nabout 30 riders. Um, Matt Beers took\nover just as they started to slide into\nthe lower pitches that are like really\nsteep, super rudded and uh, pace\nratcheted up. Keegan was right on his\nwheel. Um, so the group of 30 went to\nabout seven. Um, as we got to the top\nhere, Simon Po as Po, one of the newer\nriders in the Grand Prix, Swiss like\nbreakaway superstar. Um, he was\nstruggling to stay on the wheel. I think\nhe was about 10 seconds off at the top,\nbut uh, yeah, the pace is picking up.\nSecond lap has started. They're probably\nabout 10 miles in. I'm going to go catch\nup with them in a\nminute. Oh my goodness, what a day\nalready. We're only lap one lap in and\nit's nothing but attrition. where have\nconstantly having athletes off the back\ncoming back on uh moments of sitting up\npressure up and over some of the climbs\nout of Baloy Canyon and then you have\nthis beast to finish it off. It is\nbrutal out here and they are putting it\nto each other. Heck, Cesley Decker,\nSophia Vishafany, two names constantly\nat the front. Haley Batten continuously\nat the front of this race making it\nanimated. We've got our women into sight\nas they make their way down into the\ncourse proper. We know Halley Batten is\nin that group as well. And here they are\ncoming around the turn. Five riders, one\njust off the pace a little bit as we're\ngoing to see that first rider tripping\nour camera here in just a moment. They\nmake their way onto the pavement. I see\nour defending champion in that mix. So\nwe've got Haley Batten, we've got Cesaly\nDecker, Meisa Rollins, Sophia Gomez,\nAvisha Fier, Haley Pin in that mix\ncoming on through. Lauren Stevens, and\nAlexis Escarda. So what a great mix\nwe've got as they come through right\nnow. Our lead rider on the front that is\nCesaly Decker. She was the rider doing\nall the driving going up that climb. We\nwere trying to identify her. We couldn't\nquite see that number, but those last\ntwo miles uphill, she absolutely was the\none doing the damage causing that split.\nThey are now heading back up the hill.\nThey look like they're unified. Everyone\ntaking on a little bit of nutrition.\nGoing to be so so important as they come\nthrough there. Paige Onweller making her\nway through as well. Aaron Huck also\ncoming through. So those riders only\nabout 20 seconds behind. So right now\nthe big story is we've got six women in\nthe lead after one lap of racing. Cesaly\nDecker out of Santa Fe, New Mexico\ndriving the train along with Meisa\nRollins, Sophia Gomez, Visha, Haley Pin,\nLawrence\nStevens, and I believe just a few\nseconds down we had Alexis Escarda. So\nthat is your leading group right now.\nThird of the way through our race. One\nlap down, two laps to go for our elite\nwomen round number one of the 2025\nLifetime Grand Prix. So, Simon here\ngetting a good head start onto the\nlookout. First time up, still warming up\nto today's race. Was on the back of the\nlead group with a small gap, but showing\na lot of tenacity and fight to stay on\nprobably one of the riders with the most\nrace days in his legs. 25. 25 race days\nin his\nlegs. This is a\ncollaborative commentary with\nSimon. Swiss rider living in spending a\nlot of time in Colombia with his wife.\nGot married last December.\nmaking a huge impression on the Grand\nPrix series right now with this lead. We\nare live here at the stage with our\nupdate for our men's race. We are at the\n51.8 mile checkpoint. So clearly we are\nwell into the second half of our race so\nfar. The big news is the man who was\ntailg out of Switzerland. He is off the\nfront a minute 24 gap solo. The second\nhalf of the race is really where things\ntake shape. And uh just like clockwork,\nthat's exactly what's going down here as\nwe are just past the 52 mile marker here\nin round number one of the 2025 Lifetime\nGrand Prix here at the Sea Otter\nClassic. We are coming up on our 59.6\nkilometer check mark out on the course.\nWe're going to check in with our SPLI\nleaderboard. Right now we've got Cesaly\nDecker in the lead driving the pace.\nAlso in that group we've got Haley\nBatton, the Olympic silver medalist in\nthe mountain bike event who's looked\nvery strong so far today. Meisa Rollins,\nlast year's upset winner at the\nLeadville Trail 100. And of course we've\ngot last year's winner overall of the\nLifetime Grand Prix. Sophia Gomez, Visha\namong others in the group. Haley Pin in\nthere as well. Caroline Resin, Alexis\nScarta also in that group. We've also\ngot Excel Dubau Provo, Paige Onweller,\nLauren Stevens, Ceil Leune. That is 11\nriders in the front group. So, if you\nremember when they wrapped up lap number\none, we only had six riders, but we had\na couple sets of riders chasing. They've\nobviously made contact. They've made the\nconnection to that front group cuz we\nhad talked about it and there was a lot\nof uh disorganization, I guess we would\ncall it, going on in that front group.\nOnce they had gotten over that climb to\ndescend into the venue, everyone kind of\nlooking at each other, kind of riding on\nopposite sides of the course, taking in\na little hydration. Nobody really\nwilling to lead that charge. And well,\nall that did was allow the chase to come\nback up. Current situation in our women,\nthey should be hitting that 44 1/2 mile\ncheckpoint in just a few moments. 11\nriders in that lead group just before\nthe halfway point of round number one in\na lifetime Grand Prix. Just like that,\nwe've got Pollo making his way into\nsight. He is down low. Look at that\nmouth open. In Central America, we refer\nto that as going to the dentist. He is\nshowing his teeth. That means he is\nshowing a big effort out there on the\ncourse. So, Pollo now making that\nleft-hand turn onto the pavement. We're\ngoing to see a big acceleration as he\nmakes his way through and it is going to\nbe the final lap of racing. Look at\nthat. The chase group is coming hard.\nAlexi Verullen leading that chase. Matt\nBeers, Keegan Swenson all in tow there.\nSo that gap has nearly evaporated. That\nexplains the look back just a moment\nago. Pollo his time in the sun here in\nAmerica may well be coming to an end.\nHere comes our chase right now. And that\nis going to be Verullen on the front.\nThat's going to be Dylan Johnson leading\nthe charge through Keegan Swenson. Matt\nBeer's in tow. 22 seconds is the gap and\noh, how the tide has turned with one lap\nto go. Tim, walk us through what you see\ngoing on out there today. Well, I say\nthat uh I see that risky move by Simon\nPo. I mean, he's really he's an unknown\nto both the riders and the course. He's\nout there just throwing it down. Uh the\nattack that he did leading into the\nsingle track section before Lookout was\njust incredible. He was super fast. He\ndoesn't know what kind of uh competition\nhe's going to be up against. And I think\nthe group dynamics in the back, they\nneed to figure out if he's really the\nrisk that that they should use their\nmatches to be able to bring back. Um\nriding behind him, I can tell you I'm\nusing an ebike. He's really hard to\nfollow. Well, that's a great update from\nTim Johnson. He's going to get himself\nuh set to get back out there on course\nand continue to give us some phenomenal\nupdates. So, thanks Tim for keeping us\nin the loop for what's going on at the\nvery front end of the race. Round number\none of the 2025 Lifetime Grand Prix. We\nare turning our attention now back to\nthe women's race. Right now we are\nlooking at the Chase and Cesaly Decker\ncontinuing to do a lot of the pace\nsetting here in this group. We've got a\nvery big group and from the looks of it\nthings are pretty organized out there.\nMel Lisa Rollins looking very very\nstrong. We've also got Paige Onweller in\nthat group. Lauren de Cresenzo, Caroline\nResin also in that group near the back.\nWe know Haley Batten, that gap is\ncontinuing to grow, but the Chase has\nnot given up just yet. They are\nfighting. They want to try and reel this\nthing back in. They know now is the\ntime. They've got to stay on the gas.\nThey can't let this leash get any longer\nif they want to contend for the top spot\non the podium right now. So again,\nCesley Decker absolutely laying down the\npower. Right now, we're back with the\nmen's race. Simon Pelo still off the\nfront, still solo. That chase has to be\ncoming. Tim, what do you see out there?\nWell, I'm mostly just impressed with how\nlong that uh Simon has been off the\nfront like this because he's been able\nto push 35 almost 40 mph this entire\ndescent away from Laguna Secika by\nhimself. You know, the group just as a\nyou know, as a larger group of riders\nhas momentum, so they're going a little\nbit faster, but Simon showing no letup.\nHe's just starting to climb back out. So\nthis descent uh you see the Swiss rider\nwith po you know he lives part of the\nyear in Colombia. He has a Colombian\nwife. They just were married last\nDecember. Um so signing up for the\nLifetime Grand Prix series and saying\nI'm going to come to America and race is\nreally tough to to be able to do. It's a\nhuge commitment. Um but I just got to\nsay I'm I'm so impressed with how he's\nriding uh the race dynamic from behind\ndeciding who's going to be chasing,\nwho's going to be sitting back. Um, you\nknow, this is the kind of situation,\nBill, where in a in a typical road race,\nthat that decision will often give\nriders in the back uh the chance to\nreally really rest. You know, they might\ncome back in, uh, 20 minutes, 30 minutes\nand feel like a million bucks because\nthey've been sitting on the group, but\nSimon has no one to sit on. You know,\nthis kind of a climb. I I was just out\nthere. It's really hot. It is very\nsteep, and, you know, it's the first of\ntwo. So, they have to be able to get\nover this thing close to Simon and then\nthey might be able to stand up and go.\nThat's Paul Voss, German National Gravel\nChampion there. On the back, looks like\nhe's having a hard time holding the\npace. But, uh, on the front, I'm going\nto guess that's the typical Matt Beers\nor Alexi Vermu. I see, you know, the way\nthat Alexi rides is very familiar to us.\nUm, he's just got so much tenacity when\nhe's on the front. And, uh, Brendan\nJohnson, he he has really looked good\nthroughout the day. But um you know Matt\nBeers, Keegan Swson both look like they\nare the favorites. Pete Stetna looks\nlike he's just popped off the back. He\nwas having a hard time on lookout and\nhad to really fight to get back up and\nover that um the last flat section. But\nhere we are into the steepest parts.\nAlexi on the front, Beers right behind\nand Keegan all the while just ready to\npounce. We've got Johnson just behind.\nYou can see Keegan, as you said, Keegan,\nwe've we've only talked about him in\nterms of he's been in all the lead\ngroups, per se, but he's not really ever\nbeen the front rider across any of the\ntiming pads. So, he's done a good job of\nof kind of staying out of sight in those\ngroups and really conserving that\nenergy. Yeah. You know, Bill, another\nperson that I see is Alex Wild. So, he's\nin the light colored jersey sitting\nabout fifth position. He just looks like\nhe's about to go around Keegan now. And\nuh they're going to be up there at right\nat the top of this climb is really kind\nof the reset buttons. We are back live\nwith the women and a big move unfolding\nright now. Haley Batton, silver medalist\nin the Olympics is making a big move off\nthe front right now. You know, Bill, I I\ndon't know how many how often we get to\nhave a fresh Olympic medal out on\ncourse. I know I saw she had posted\nearlier this week she was building a\ngravel bike really for the first time.\nyou know, she is a mountain biker at\nheart and uh definitely stole the show\nat the Paris Olympics in 2024. Um\ndeciding to race here, you know, she's\ngot her partner in the men's race in\nSean Finchum and she's out there just\nabsolutely hammering. We haven't had a\nbig huge attack really since last year\nwith Melissa Rollins at Big Sugar um who\nwas able to go to the line with Sophia\nGomez Vijany, but you know, her\nspecialized teammate Haley Batten, she's\nreally putting on a show. She's got a 48\nsecond gap right now, Tim, over the next\ngroup of about uh it looks like nine\nriders or so. So, Haley Batten looking\nvery, very strong out there right now.\nYou know, I love to see this, Bill. This\nis a um a really solid group. Obviously,\nsome of the best riders in the world. Uh\nHaley proving that that fact that she's\ngot that Olympic medal, but um she looks\nrock solid. This is one of the earlier\nclimbs coming back towards here in the\nLaguna Secika and uh I just I just love\nseeing this effort out there. You know,\nthe riders in the in the group chasing.\nYou have Cesaly Decker, the American\nrider, wearing the podal kit. We have\nMelissa Rollins, the Leadville winner\nfrom last year. Um and the winningest\nwoman's rider of all time is Sophia\nGomez Vijany. Haley Pin, the South\nAfrican. And you know, Bill, she just\ngot back from um winning the South\nAfrican Gravel National Championships\njust on Sunday. So that was barely 4\ndays ago. Uh Caroline Resin is one of\nthe younger riders that we have in the\nfield. I've been able to ride with her\nand I got to say you she's got a huge\nengine, lots of talent. Great to see her\nputting it together. Paige on Weller,\nyou know, she burst onto the scene\nwinning big sugar that uh first time\naround in the in the Grand Prix series.\nUh and then the Australian national\nchampion Courtney Sherwell uh just with\nLawrence Stevens and our American\nnational champion Alexis Carta. So that\nis quite a chase group behind\nwith so much firepower behind. That's\ngot to be a tough call for our current\nleader right now. And uh tactically\nspeaking, a lot of those when you've got\nso many strong riders in one chase\ngroup. often what happens is not so much\na concerted chase but a lot of looking\naround and maybe a lot of little of\nattacks out there and and Tim certainly\nyou know from your days racing that\nsometimes that rhythm that that chasing\nrhythm of chase catch chase catch works\nreally better for the solo rider to keep\nthat steady rhythm and I'll tell you so\nmuch firepower they're going to have to\nget organized pretty soon otherwise\nBatton may may well ride clear with this\nright now yeah you can say roller\ncoaster Again, Bill, this is such a hard\ncourse to get a rhythm on. If you are\nalone, you know, it feels better when\nyou're on a climb. You know, no one is\nreally stretching your uh your elastic\nband, but on the downhills and the\nflats, you just you just know that a\ngroup behind is going to be making up\ntime. Taking a look at our stell by\nDexcom elevation profile, we can see the\nleaders are just getting into that final\nclimb to top out at the very top of the\ncourse before they descend down into the\nraceway to conclude lap number two here.\nDecker very strong. She's uh if there\nwas an award for the person on the front\nthe most today, I think Cesaly Decker\nwould uh win that award hands down as\nshe continues to drive that train. Two\nriders, I believe that is Leune on her\nwheel as they now separate themselves\nprobably by about just three or 4\nseconds. It looks like that might be\nGomez Vafany on the chase now\nrecognizing the danger. Uh but certainly\nabout six riders have split off. So\nabout four or five riders have now been\nuh maybe shown the back door in that\nchase group. And this this could be the\nmoment that you were alluding to Tim\nwhere you have to stay present in the\nrace. You can't let that race get up the\nroad because then your chances just\ncompletely go out the window. So a\ncouple riders really taking this by the\nreinss right now.\nYeah, that once again that is just such\na strong push. So, looks like Sophia\nGomez Vich is having enough of sitting\nin the group and wants to get out. You\nknow, she's bringing herself back up to\nthird place in the group. Going to go\nright by Leon and onto Decker's back\nwheel. So, this is one of the flatter\nsections, Bill. You have a second to\nbreathe. You can kind of spin out the\nlegs just for a second before you have\nto go right back into it. And excuse me,\nthat is Melissa Rollins in second wheel\non decker. And so now we know why that\nclimbing was so strong. She's got her uh\nher new team. She's with Live Giant this\nyear, the Liv um Gravel Collective. And\nuh she's really put herself I you know,\nI think she's going to be one of the\nbest overall um contenders that we have\nthis year. Once again, you know, she\nfinished last year on a high with a\ngreat race at Big Sugar, but Melissa\nRollins really setting herself up for a\ngreat finish today. Current situation at\nthe end of lap number two, which of\ncourse means one lap to go. Haley\nBattton rolling through with an\nunbelievable 3 minute and 38 second gap\nover the Chasers. That is going to be\nCesaly Decker and Sophia Gomez Visha\nFier. Another 20 seconds back. Haley Pin\nalong with Meisa Rollins, Alexis Scarta,\nand Paige Onwell are all in that mix.\nFollowed by Lauren Stevens. Another 30\nseconds back. But the big story right\nnow, Tim, it is all the Haley Batten\nshow. 3 minutes and 38 seconds. I mean,\nthat's a pretty significant gap. I I'm\nhardressed to think that is going to\ncome back over the remaining 30 m right\nnow and going away and and adding to it.\nI feel I felt like every single pedal\nstroke she had on the lookout, she was\nadding a few seconds. Uh and she's just\ngoing to continue. You know, you've got\nsomebody with such an incredible\nbackground pedigree, you know, coming\noff of an an amazing\n2024. There is really nothing that's\ngoing to stand in her way. Looking at\nour chase group here, we've got Cesaly\nDecker in the Brown and Pormal. Sophia\nGomez, Vijany, she she looks like she is\nhaving a bit of a hard time. You know,\nshe's normally so incredibly strong,\nfluid, right off the front and just\nmaking everyone else chase her. But I\nfeel like she's got her uh her matches\nwith her right there. Cesley Decker\nreally really strong today. And Lauren,\nyou were with Cesalie Decker and Sophia\nGomez Vijany. How were they getting\nalong? What was that? What was happening\nin that group? Yeah, it was really\ninteresting when Haley went. This was\nthe first time that we've seen Sophia on\nthe other foot, right? So, it's usually\nbeen Sophia always off the front. She's\nalways been the aggressor. And here she\nis now being on the other foot and being\nlike, \"Wow, what does this feel like?\"\nHuh? Yeah. How what do I do to get back\nup there? And let me tell you, you know,\nshe wasn't panicked, but I also haven't\nseen a big jump or I don't want to say a\nlot of spark out of Sophia, but you\nknow, you haven't seen really pop a lot\nof snap out of her today. Yeah, we were\ntalking about that earlier. Yeah. And\nlike Cesaly has just been riding the\nfront of this race all day. It's like\nagain, everybody's like, \"Well, why\nwould you do that?\" But at the same\npoint, no one else is riding otherwise\nit just kind of sits up. Melissa was\nrolling through. Um, and when they were\nall together, Haley was up there just as\nmuch. Paige Onweller was up there and\nthen boom, when Haley Battton went, she\nwas out of sight, you guys. It was\nunbelievable. That's awesome. What a\nwhat a great race. And you know, Cesaly\nDecker, she she has been showing that\nshe's got the speed, she's got the\npower, she has this this deep talent,\nand I think it was getting in the groove\nof the racing, getting in the groove of\nshowing up week after week, being able\nto put together a big race, and here she\nis with the winningest woman on the\nseries. We are back with an update on\nour men's race. They've been through the\n81.4 mile checkpoint.\njust inching their way close to home\nhere. Only about 8 and 1/2 miles to go.\nSimon Pillow, it still shows him as\nhaving a little bit of a gap over Matt\nBeer's Alexi Vermullan with Keegan\nSwinson and Alex Wild and Brendan\nJohnson just a little bit behind. Yeah,\nthis is going to be a critical point in\nthe race right now. You see everyone\nkind of spread out taking a look at each\nother. Somebody has got to take the\nreigns right now cuz Pollo, every time\nthey slow down, this is going to work in\nPo's favor. Look at this. We've got a\nbig move now coming. That is going to be\nMatt Beers finally laying down the\npower. This is crunch time right now.\nAlexi Vermuan responding immediately. He\ndoesn't want to let Beers get up the\nroad without him in tow. This is kind of\na a mix match of who is the biggest and\nwho's the smallest in this front group.\nBut those two are going to work really\nwell together. Keegan Swinson\nrecognizing the danger and letting those\ntwo riders up the road. All the while\nSimon is just out of frame. He is\nfighting his own fight. But looks like\nVermean right to the front. Bill. Yeah,\nlook at that body language, Tim. Those\nshoulders really dropped. Rocking in\ntime with the pedaling cadence. He is\ngoing all in right now. They know that\nthey've got a little bit of a gap over\nthe rest of the chasers. This is their\nopportunity to try and go clear, try and\nmake the catch and get by Po as quickly\nas they can. I don't want to take any\npulls with beers. Look at that. He is\njust hammering so hard. They've only got\nprobably 20 minutes left of racing from\nthis point on. This is before they get\nback into the big climb of Lookout\nLookout Ridge. But Vermuan looking back\ntrying to see what's what the reaction\nis like within the group. I know that\nwe've got a lot of riders who still have\na dream of getting on the podium. But\nVermuan and Beers's perfect matchup\nright now. Those two are working really\nwell together. Yeah, Beer's taking an\nexceptionally long pull on the front\nright now. Obviously, you can see by the\nspeed they're on maybe a slightly\nflatter portion right now. Getting into\na little bit of a tuck on this descent.\nAnd Alexi just hanging on for dear life\nright now while Matt just takes a huge\nhuge\npull as he starts to ride away. And look\nat this Tim. The catch is finally going\nto be made. Po has been off the front\nfor nearly an hour and it's all coming\ndown to this moment. Beer's going to be\nthe first one to get by. He moves just a\nlittle bit to the right. Can Po get on?\nThis is going to be critical. If he can\nhang on to the real wheel, he's going to\ntry and recover best he can. He's a\nsuperhero if he can do this. Come on. He\nhas been out front for more than 2 hours\ntoday. There's no way he can hold that\ngap. Keegan Swenson still looking like\nhe's been holding back throughout the\nday just for a moment like this. Brendan\nJohnson has enough to be able to\nrespond. Well, just like that, Brendan\nJohnson has been dispatched and the four\nis now three. Keegan Swinson on the\nfront. You can see that body language.\nHe is really starting to put a little\nextra power in the pedals right now. and\nBeer's hanging on in third position, but\nyou know, he knows that he's got\nsomething deeper than the other two, and\nhe just kind of needs to like settle\nback in and and just get over the top of\nthis thing. Alexi Vermuan, totally\ndifferent approach. He wants to stick to\nthat back wheel as much as he possibly\ncan. Keegan Swinson though having\nnothing to do with those two and it\npowering away, getting to the top of\nLookout. You can see the wind in the in\nthe grass on the side of this trail\nright now. They know that the day is\ncoming to a close and Keegan Swenson is\ntaking off. This is our move right here.\nKeegan Swinson taking a quick look back\nover his shoulder and look at the real\nestate he has opened up very very\nquickly on Alexi and Matt. Matt trying\nto go to the front. Desperate to stay\ninto contact. He knows if they can get\nover the top of the ridge. He can use\nhis physical advantage on the downhill\nto stay in contention. But Keegan\nSwenson is no longer waiting for anyone.\nThis is the move.\nThis is that downhill section heading\nback into Laguna Secika, Lauren. And I\nfeel like if there's one guy who can\nhold high power all the way to the line,\nit's going to be Matt Beers. No doubt.\nBut you know, he has that sharp right\nhand turn, right? Then the climb across\nthe gravel and then he's got to come\nback up and over the corkcrew. And those\nare brutal finishes. It's just such a\nhard finish. It's not a roll in, right?\nAnd then you've got all this downhill\ncoming through. And then you've got the\nhard left hand turn to the finish. Yeah,\nit looks like it is. Keegan had already\ngone off the front before we came back\non air. So it looks like we've got\nKeegan Swenson with a small gap over\nMatt Beers and he is the one who's\nclimbing Corkscrew with a lead over\nBeers. This is going to be a brutal\nfinish. Keegan Swenson no no stranger to\nwinning here at Sea Otter. He has been\ncoming here since he was a young\nmountain bike racer lining up year after\nyear. Won all of the lifetime Grand Prix\nFuego XL's and uh looks like Keegan has\na small gap over Matt Beers. But is that\ngoing to be enough to be able to get\ninto this downhill before the finish?\nDon't give Keegan any room at all.\nRight. He is He's a shark. He's a tiger.\nHe is a killer this guy. If he knows how\nto win, it's it's definitely Keegan.\nlike he's just always been a winner and\nhe always knows how to just put the\ndagger in and turn that screw. Just turn\nit. I don't even know. I don't have all\nthe superlatives, man. I'm just getting\nthem all. Yeah. No, he's definitely got\nso much to go with. And this is the\nfinal turn back onto Laguna Secika.\nBit of a flat section before the\ndownhill into the finish\narea. We've got Keegan Swinton. crowd. I\nmean, Lauren, the crowd is nuts here at\nthe finish. People are getting hyped.\nThis is definitely a huge open to the\nseason. It's great. It is so great. And\nit is such a fast finish once he gets to\nthe top of the racetrack. It's nothing\nbut hard pack sand all the way into the\nfinish line. Tim and Lauren, thanks for\nthat insight. Ladies and gentlemen, we\nhave our leader in sight. Keegan Swinson\nis officially around the final turn on\nthe gravel directly across from the main\nstage here. It took him two big attacks\non that final climb to finally shake the\ncompetition. And he is just about to\nmake that final lefthand turn,\ntransition onto the pavement for the\nfinal time today. Ladies and gentlemen,\nif you're along the Bears, now's your\ntime. Make a little noise. Meet the new\nboss, the same as the old boss. This is\nyour winner, Keegan\nSwinson. Oh my, what a day out there on\ncourse. And I'll tell you what, if you\nquestion the effort, he literally just\nleft it all out there on the course\ntoday. And Swinson coming across the\nline. Matt Beers made up a lot of time\non that final descent, able to finish in\nsecond place. Hard fought for all these\nriders in the top three. There's Alexi\nVermuan making the final turn around the\nBronco Wild Fund. It's great to have\nthem as a supporter of the Lifetime\nGrand Prix. You know that Vermuan is\nthinking about the overall points, what\nthis means for his season, how he's able\nto stay in the fight. Peter Vakotch in\nfourth position in the blue, also making\nthat final turn. You can tell that\nVermuan really had hoped to be in there\nfor the win, but a strong finish\nnonetheless. So, it's, you know, it's a\ntestament to his mindset and his race\nprep that he's always here to fight and\nwin for podium. Yep. No, it's a great\ncompetitor out there. And, uh, we see\nthe rest of the chase group coming\nthrough here at the finish line. That is\nBrendan Johnston, Australian Gravel\nNational Champion once again. He won\nthat title at the end of our fall at the\nbeginning of his spring down under and\nreturning back to America. you know,\nhe's no stranger to the Grand Prix. He's\nalways up there fighting so hard to get\non the podium in fourth position. It's\ngoing to be able to do that today. Alex\nWild, the Californian as well. It looks\nlike Matt Wilson, very excited to be\nable to get through and that's going to\nbe a huge finish for another wild card.\nSo, that puts Peter Vak is a wild card\nrider as well as Wilson. So, two riders\nin the top five. All right, we are here\nwith today's champion, Keegan Swenson.\nKeegan, I mean, another victory, right?\nAnother lifetime Grand Prix, another\nvictory. This one looked like it went\ndown to the wire kind of like last year.\nWalk us through how this race unfolded\nfor you. Yeah, it was uh kind of fast\ntactical racing all day, you know, and\nthat climb was really the only place\nthere was much selection.\nUm, so every lap it would kind of\nseparate, but then it kind of come back\ntogether and the group just kind of got\nsmaller and smaller and uh, you knew it\nwas going to be that was going to be the\ndeciding factor the last lap. So, I was\njust trying to play the cards right and\nget in there and feeling half decent.\nSo, when you made that uh that last\nattack up the climb, looked like you got\nsome separation pretty quickly, but then\nAlexi and Matt got back up to you. Was\nthat uh were you a little concerned when\nthey got back up to you again? Uh yeah,\nI mean, you know, I put a dig on that\nfirst steep bit. You know, Matt's a big\nguy, so I knew it hurt him the most\nthere. And I had a feeling they would\ncome back, but they were going to have\nto work quite hard to come back. and I\njust tried to rest a little bit so I\ncould kick again on that uh last little\nlookout ridge pick there. Um so yeah,\nyou know, I was a little bit wasn't\nquite sure how it would play out when\nthey came back, but uh just, you know,\ngave it everything I had that last climb\nleft open up a small gap and make it to\nthe finish. And inside the chase group,\nwe see Melissa Rollins on the front.\nShe's been powering a lot of the chase\nso far. You know, she's recovering from\na couple broken wrists over the winter.\nYou can see the brace that she's using\non her left wrist to support that\nfracture. And uh you know, she's really\nstarting off the season great just to be\nin for the kill here in in fifth, you\nknow, top five position so far. Haley\nPin, the South African National\nChampion, and Alexis Scarda, who is a\nformer US National Bike Champion. And\nPon Weller here tacked onto the back of\nthis group. She's really doing one of\nthe first races of her season after the\ncancellation of Midsouth. a lot of the\nriders having to reschedu things, but\nshe's dipping into her pantry there on\nthe top tube trying to get some\nnutrition. Such an important thing to\nkeep in mind when you are in a race like\nthis with so much power that you have to\nput out for over 90 miles. Lauren, we're\nback with Haley Batten as she is getting\ninto the lower slopes of Lookout Ridge.\nAnd you know what? Her lead has\ncontinued to grow. The last time check\nwe got was 4 and 1/2 minutes, but the\nway that she's riding right now, she is\nstill building on that lead. Don't you\nthink? Just powering. I mean, it's it's\nunbelievable. I mean, it's believable\ncuz who she is and what she's done. But\nI I just can't believe that she's put\nthis much time into someone like Cesley\nand Sophia. To be honest with you, it's\nit's freaking amazing. Haley Batten is\njust putting on such a show for all the\nfans here at the Sea Otter Classic. And\nto start off this Lifetime Grand Prix\nSeries stop with two incredible races\ntoday. We are all all fortunate to be\nhere watching this right now. And and\nHaley not even looking back yet, still\npushing forward, still wanting to just\ncontinue her effort. Like she's riding\nthe drops. She's ready to go. This is\nthat long flat section into the descent.\nHigh speed, 35 plus miles an hour. And\nuh she's going to go past the feed zone.\nShe's got so many friends and\nsupporters. You know, when you're racing\non the international circuit, to be able\nto come home, drive to the race, put\nyour take your bike out of the car and\njust go, you know, get to it. She is\nreally taking advantage of that. Haley\nBatten coming into the finish line. What\na great race today. Well, we're talking\nabout one of the most experienced riders\nin the group today. She's been a\nmulti-time national champion. She's been\nan Olympic silver medalist. So, this is\na rider that knows very well the feeling\nof crossing the finish line and putting\nin a big big effort to achieve a\nphenomenal result. So, Haley Batten now\naround the final turn on the dirt. Here\ncomes Haley Batten. Just a couple\nhundred meters to go. Bunny hop that\ntiming mat. She's going to take that\nlefthand turn right around the Ford\nBronco.\nLadies and gentlemen, officially on the\nfinal straightaway here. High fives for\nthe crowd. All smiles. Your 2024 Olympic\nsilver medalist. Now your champion here\nat Sea Honor. This is Haley\nBatten. Fans here to welcome her back\ninto the finish. Haley Batten. Such an\nincredible finish. Our Olympic silver\nmedalist. What a finish for Badden. Yes.\nAnd look at that celebration. And then\nit's minute back to second and\nthird. But again, you know, it'll be\ninteresting to see how Cesaly and Sophia\nplay this last couple of miles coming\ninto town, coming into Laguna Seciko\nRaceway. Yeah. So, this is that last\nlittle pitch down. Uh it's a kind of a\nhard right-hand turn right here. It's\nreally loose and soft. Sophia going on\nthe outside. That is a tough position to\nbe in, but you know, there's only two\nmore uphill sections before they get to\nthe core crew. So, it looks like Sophia\nstill has some some juice in those legs.\nYou know, talking to the riders who had\ndone the Cape Epic, it's such a big\nstart to the season, but maybe her legs\nhave really opened up. Matt Beer said he\nfelt incredible today and he was trying\nto hold it in so that he didn't use up\nthose legs. Maybe Sophia's been really\nplaying, you know, possum all day and\nshe's ready to go to town now. Well,\nSophia's had such a good start like\nyou're talking about. She's she did so\nwell at Cape Epic. She's also won BWR\nArizona and she also won Valley of\nTears. So, I mean, if anybody if you\nlook at all the athletes and how they've\nset up into this race, you we've had\ninjuries, we have sickness, but you've\nnever heard any of that from Sophia.\nShe's basically had like the perfect off\nseason from what we can see, right? You\nnever know what behind happens behind\nclosed doors or what these athletes\nmight not want to tell you, but I'll\ntell you from race results, she's on\nfire already. She sure is. And back to\nwinning ways. I mean, to be undefeated\nfor the season so far, whether here in\nNorth America or on the continent of\nAfrica, but she's got Cesaly Decker\nready to to fight. You know, I don't\nknow what the sprint really looks like\nfor Cesaly. um coming from a a ski\nbackground races a lot of ski mo that's\nnot exactly a a sprint sport. Um at the\ninternational level it is, but if you're\njust backountry skiing, you are ready to\ngo to town for the entire day you're out\nin the back country. But just getting\noff onto the pavement, it looks like\nDecker had a hesitation. It's so deep\nthere, Lauren. That's like 6 in deep of\nreally loose marbles. Um that is meant\nto catch race cars that are out of\ncontrol as it descends the course crew.\nSo, no wonder she had a little bit of a\nmoment there, but she's back onto Vijay\nFier's back wheel. And uh Sophia looks\nlike she's got her head down pushing\nhard. Yeah, this is going to be an\nexciting finish. Again, Sophia is very\nkoi, very smart, knows how to play a\nfinish where Yes, Cesy is kind of our\nunknown, right? I think whoever Gosh, I\nmean, they've got to be so exhausted.\nWhoever comes out of that turn first, in\nmy opinion, is likely going to win\nbecause it's only 250 meters to the\nfinish. Oh, look at that right now.\nYeah. Does Sophia go early? Does she go\non the corkcrew like she's trying now?\nShe's definitely putting Cesley under\npressure right now and making a split.\nThat looks like it's going to be enough\nto break Decker's leg. She doesn't have\nan answer to that bit of a headshake.\nLooks like she's gasping just enough.\nBut Sophia Gomez, Via standing up,\npushing over that last steep pitch out\nof the racetrack before the descent. She\nhas put four or five seconds into Decker\nalready. That is the separation that's\ngoing to get her second place.\nShe's definitely gonna have to stay on\nthe pedals on this over this little bit\nof a riser and all the way through to\nthe finish cuz never quits. This this\nlady will come back after you time and\ntime again. And this is a heck of a\nresult for Cesaly no matter what. If she\ngets second or third, I mean, she was on\nshe was knocking on the door last year.\nHad some bad luck. change teams, changed\neverything, change bikes. I'm excited to\nsee what Cesal is going to do this year\nand for her to be on the podium today is\nhuge.\nTotally agree, Lauren. Sophia Gomez,\nVisha Fier, very familiar with the top\nstep today. She's going to be in second\nwith a super strong\nfinish. Cesley Decker just coming into\nview at the top of the screen, but\nSophia's all alone here into the finish.\nYou know, she has been first or second\nat so many Grand Prix events, whether\nit's on a gravel bike or a mountain\nbike. She shows her versatility, her\ndeep reservoir of talent. Um, she is the\nnumber one favorite in any race that she\nlines up in. And you know, today she met\nher match in Haley Batten. Such a\nperformance for Batten. Sophia Gomez\nVijany starting off this season with\nanother huge notch in that belt to be\nable to go for another overall series\nvictory and the Lifetime Grand Prix.\nI think Sophia is should be very happy\nwith this result today and Cesaly should\nbe very happy with this result. Look,\nHaley Battton was on a next level like\nwhat? And that's okay, right? Like again\nshe's for again we can look back Sophia\nand Cesley are part of the Lifetime\nGrand Prix. Haley's not. So again this\nis almost a win for Sophia coming now\ndown through the straight. Yeah look at\nGomez Vijay coming across the finish\nline. Second position waving to the\ncrowd here. Decker just behind. This has\nbeen a long hard hot day. 5 hours and 8\nminutes for second position. And here\ncomes Cesalie Decker. Her best finish in\nthe Lifetime Grand Prix. Happy with\nthird place. I think so. She's looking\nover. She's excited. And you know, being\nwith Sophia for the last couple of hours\nchasing Haley Batten, you know, she\nspent a lot of time with the the woman\nwho's the best in the sport and as\nsomeone who's really still on her way\nup. We don't know how good she's going\nto get. So, for her to be able to learn\nthose kinds of things, spending time\nwith Sophia, learning how she does it,\nshe's going to be even better at the\nnext race. All right, we are with the\nwinner, Haley Battton. Holy cow, you\nwent so early. I I don't know. I don't\neven know where to start with the\nquestioning of like cuz it was kind of\nmind-blowing. Did you know that you were\ngoing to go when you went on that lap\nright before the single track or right\nat the single track? No, I definitely\nhad no race plan coming into this. This\nis my first gravel race and I just kind\nof wanted to see how the riders were\nriding and working together and I felt\nlike they were hesitating a lot and not\nreally in sync as a as a group. And so I\nthought that maybe if I surprised\neverybody, nobody would be expecting it.\nAnd you know, I I kind of hoped when I\nwent I I tacked into the single track on\nlap two um that maybe like a rider or\ntwo would be with me to like help keep\nit away. But you know, I just pushed\nreally hard. I knew if they hesitated\nfor a second, I could probably keep it.\nAnd I just kept going. And I will say on\nthe last lap, I regretted my decision.\nAnd it was uh yeah, I was deep in the\npain cave for sure. But yeah, it was it\nwas a good good race. Really? Let's talk\nabout the hurt a little bit because we\nhad heard from a couple of athletes.\nThey were actually cramping on the last\ncoming up the corkcrew. Were you in any\npain that much pain? I mean, just you\njust didn't look like it. I like barely\nmade it up that last climb. I think the\nwhole last lap I was just yeah I was\ndeeply in pain but I you know I think\nthat's the thing for me. I'm not scared\nof suffering and I think that's why I\nwent so early. I I can lean into it. I\ncan lean into the suffering and the pain\nand I'm not scared of it and yeah I\nembraced that today and I just dove all\nthe way in. Thank you so much for a\nfantastic day. Congratulations. You know\nwe just want to take a look at what\nhappened today, the results and uh what\nto look forward to for the rest of the\nyear. So, let's take a look at how these\nraces came down. Top 10 from today's\nrace. Incredible finish for the men.\nKeegan Swenson putting in such an\nincredible finish to be able to get to\nthe line uh just ahead of Matt Beers.\nReally, really close inside of 10\nseconds. Beers is really chasing him\ndown that final hill, right? And Alexi\nVermulan pushing so hard those last\ncouple of climbs coming through the into\nthe finish is just unbelievably hard\nracing. And uh some of the non- Grand\nPrix riders, Peter Vakot, you know, the\ncheck rider, he was in the Grand Prix\nlast year, had a really good result\ntoday. In fourth, Brendan Johnson, the\nAustralian national champion, Alex Wild\nfrom California, and then really the\nstory of the top 10 is Matt Wilson, a\nKiwi, who was unexpected in that top 10\ngroup, but he had some great words of\nencouragement from Keegan Swanson. Paul\nVoss, German national champion. Pete\nSten, a longtime Grand Prix rider, who\nis able to hold on for ninth place, just\nahead of our MVP. Yes, Simon. Oh my\ngosh, what a day for Simon. And let's\ntake a look at the women here. Lauren\nHaley Battton coming out with a huge win\ntoday, but unfortunately not part of the\nGrand Prix series, which keeps Sophia\nGomez Vafany on that top step, followed\nby Cesaly Decker. Again, what a great\nrace by the two of them coming into the\nline together. Haley Pin also coming in\nfourth right here with our uh South\nAfrican National Champ. Stellar day for\nher. Alexis Scarda, Melissa Melissa\nRollins, Paige Onweller again, just\noutstanding results. Courtney Sherwell\nagain new to the Lifetime Grand Prix.\nGood to have her here. Lauren Dearenzo\nhaving a tough day out there today, but\nI know we will see her in the top 10.\nContinuing on into the Lifetime Grand\nPrix, rounding out the top 10 with\nCarolyn Resin for Tim Johnson and Lauren\nHall. I'm Bill Ellison. Want to thank\neveryone for tuning in. It's been a\ngreat day of racing, but we are\nofficially wrapped up with stop number\none of the 2025 Lifetime Grand Prix here\nat the Sea Otter Classic. We will see\nyou at the next stop, Unbound, in\nEmporia,\nKansas. Heat\nup",

          "transcript": "Well guys, it's April and that can only\nmean one thing. Racing is back.\nAll right, ladies and gentlemen, warm\nwelcome everyone to the opening round of\nthe 2024 Lifetime.\nSo, why are we here? The Lifetime Grand\nPrix. Lifetime Grand Prix isn't\neverything for me as an athlete, but\nit's a majority of my season. Um, and\nit's the big focus of 2025 is to win it\noverall. Knockoff the King, Keegan\nSwinson. This is part one of six races\nacross the next eight months. And we\nwant to bring you along for all of it.\nThe good, the bad, the ugly, and\neverything in between. Lifetime Grand\nPrix is six off-road races between\ngravel and mountain biking all across\nthe country. Seat Classic, Unbound\nGravel, Leadville 100, Schwamagan 40,\nLittle Sugar, Big Sugar. It feels so\ngood to be back.\n[Applause]\nWe made it California.\n[Music]\nBeing back in Monterey is nervously\nexciting. Started the Grand Prix, start\nof a year that I thought a lot about and\nput a lot of effort into. Um, with a lot\nof unknowns. Uh, see out change from\nmountain bike race to a gravel race. Uh,\nand always every time you race a course\nthat's never been raced, no one really\nknows how it's going to play out. So, a\nlot on the line. It's also just a little\nbit more dramatic that I haven't raced\nthis year. So, myself, but as well as\neverybody else, doesn't really know\nwhere I am. Yeah. I think the the\nLifetime Grand Prix has\ngiven not only a pathway to racing, but\nalso a chance for spectators to be\ninvolved uh and cheer and create like\ntrue fandom of the sport that I think\nactually never truly existed in the US.\nIt'll be enough pancake for three guys.\nThere were times I remember growing up\nwhere you'd go to a local crit uh you go\nto crit national championships and\nthere'd be a a lot of people um at the\nside of the road watching, but I\nwouldn't really say they understood who\nor what they were watching. They were\nout there because there was beer and\nthere was a sport to watch and maybe\nthey see a crash. Um, I think now with\ngravel cycling, you have so many people\nwho\nare have a vested interest in the sport\nthemselves, whether or not they're at\nthe race and they want to see what\npeople are doing. People are trying to\nfigure out how they can better\nthemselves while watching the sport,\nwhich I think just creates this really a\nreally great hamster wheel. So, I think\none of the big unknowns in in racing is\nwhat proathletes do in the days leading\nup to the race. Why do we have two\nbikes? Well, I'm a privateeer after all\nfrom the brakes. I want to be able to\nfix it. So, that's pretty much a replica\nof this one, just different colors. Um,\nbrought some wheel options out, brought\nsome tire options out, brought some\ngearing options out. Um, but otherwise,\nit's pretty simple. Honestly, hardest\npart about a new course is not having\nseen it race before. So, it's going to\nbe a little bit of figuring out where do\nyou think pinch points are? Where do you\nthink people might attack? Where's the\nrace going to split? um before you can\neven start to think about how it's going\nto be won. Um so start to kind of put\nthat together in my head today and then\nbe able to educate uh different\nequipment decisions based off that.\nFourth year of the Grand Prix is\ninteresting. Uh we lost a lot of the\nguys that I think everyone would put up\nthere. Um for example, Lachlan Morton\nleft winner of Unbound last year. Uh\nPete Stutton is not in the Grand Prix\nanymore. Um but I think the the main\ncharacters are still there. Uh Russell\nFinsterwald, Keegan Swinson, um Matt\nBeers, Cole Patton. You know what I\nwish? What? So I was cool enough to do\nthat. That would make me arrow.\nShots fired.\nWho did I shoot at? Exactly. You know\nwho you are.\nRussell. Russell beats me in this race\nbecause his hoods were turned down.\nI'm sorry to tell you you're not bike\nriding\ntoday. Maybe the end. Bert's going to\ntake you and then from there I'll see\nyou in like an hour. Okay. He's not\nready for this. Uh the going to go\npre-ride the course again with a little\nmore intention. Think through the the\nfinal steps. Pretty much\ngearing and tires at this point. So\ndon't mess it up.\nSo we're out here pre- riding. Got\nTruman second cam. Sea Otter Lifetime\nGriffy gravel course is fast and loose\nand slippery. First probably 2 and 1\nhalf miles is really fast after you get\noff the track. Um and it might be 4 ft\nwide, but honestly you'll probably have\none rider being able to ride by. faster\nthan a mountain bike race, which is\ninteresting just in terms of the way\nit'll race. We race almost 20 m longer,\nbut I think it'll be less time. It's a\nlot of up and down, but a lot of open\nareas places that'll catch people out\nare just tight, loose corners. You come\ninto a corner with four guys, two can\nget through, someone's got a break. It's\ngoing to be a fight for position and\nthen a fight for position. The entrance\nwe take to look to look out this year is\npretty insane. Uh it's about just over\na/4 mile at 15 and a half% average with\nparts of it over over that steepness. Um\nso I think it's just going to you either\nhave the legs or you\ndon't. I'm\npinned. And I think those kind of\nmoments will break the race. Even if\npeople come back, that'll be the moments\nthat at the end with one lap to go,\nit'll be done. I think we'll have\nmaximum three guys sprinting for the win\nand a couple guys solo behind. The\ncourse is going to be one of just\nattrition.\nIt's Truman doing 600 watts behind me\nwith a camera in his\nmouth. Still undecided on some things,\nbut road pedals for sure. Um, definitely\n3.4s. I think tires I got to figure out\nand got to figure out if I want to\nchange gearing. It's Toby. Bye, Toby.\nHello. He's Norwegian. He doesn't stop.\nThat's true. went out to the diner the\nfirst morning, then pancakes, now French\ntoast, and tomorrow rice morning will be\na little more serious. We'll get some\nrice in there. Just don't get don't get\ntoo stuck. Carbs look a lot of different\nways. Mhm. Pretty much\ntalents, you know. Day before the race,\ncalm before the storm, however you want\nto say it.\nUh little bit of things to do, um\ncontent to shoot, but I think\neverything's pretty much ready. Um made\ndecisions on all the equipment I want to\nrun. Um I'm going to go do a little\nspin, talk about uh the last little\ndetails, but\notherwise it's game on. So yeah, I'm\ngoing to go do a little ride with\nKeegan. Um talk about other random\nthings. Um probably talk about the race\nvery little, which is nice. And then\nuh\notherwise go to immediate the event um\npick up registration and passes and get\nready to rock and roll.\nThat's how a pro gets out of a driveway.\nMy shoes still sparkling.\nBlinding.\nHere we go.\nUh we're just taking some head shots of\nthe Lifetime Grand Prix athletes.\nThey're all pretty excited about getting\nthe season started and uh exciting to\nsee them come in and find fiddle.\nSaw Alex. He doesn't seem ready. I'm out\nhere like a schmuck. I don't even have I\ngot a fake Can I have that one? This\nnumber's got a wild card on it. Just out\nhere freelancing. It's tough. I got\nwristband just like every other ham and\neggar showing up to the expo. No more\nfavors. It's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] jungle in there. I\ndid cut the line though. I think this is\nAlex's year to be honest. Why do you say\nthat? Um he's been building each year.\nHe's showing the mountain bike stuff.\nHe's like obviously like capable of\ndoing it. It's not mountain biky enough\nfor it to be a detriment to him. He's\nkind of at his like physiological peak.\nAnd so yeah, that would be if I was a\nbetting man, that's what I'd bet. So\nwe'll do the same PSI. I'm going to make\nfinal decisions, but I think I think one\nor two PSI higher than what we started\nat in Big Sugar. So I think I'll start\nat either 18 or 19 in the front and the\nback could be 23 or 24. Uh I'm going all\nin. So let's take out all the like\nlittle bolts on the on the top and on\nthe fork. Just take them all out. Just\ntake Yes. Dare Derek took the bike last\nnight to work on. I didn't have have the\nbike all night. I've been pretty nervous\nall week.\nUm I think a couple reasons. I think\nkind of putting out in the universe that\nyou want to win the Grand Prix\nand even though from the outside it\nmight have seemed like I've been close\nat times. I've kind of just been like,\n\"Oh, let's see what happens when I go to\nthe races.\" I've come into the year with\na little bit different focus. Grease\naxles and bearings. The race day grease\nis in there. Okay. um change the tires\nin 34. So the rear tires there and then\nyou have the fronts. Um then set up\nspare wheels. Uh Steotter has typically\nbeen good to me if we take the average\nof the last 5 years, four years. Last\nyear I finished second in the mountain\nbike race. Uh it's probably the closest\nI was to beating Keegan straight up, not\nin a sprint. Um just kind of got a\nlittle cocky and excited. Um but also\nleft really really happy to be on the\npodium. Great start to the season. Feed\nzone 2 is where I'm going to send you\nto. Um, it's 20. So, I probably need to\nleave before you guys start.\nIt's all in your hands now, man.\nLater, boys. Sorry, boys. Fight for it.\nEvery time you start with a clean slate\nin the Grand Prix, um, I think the\nbiggest question is who's going to win\nthe first race and how does that\nprecedent reset? Uh, I think if Keegan\ngoes and wins tomorrow, everyone thinks\nit's um onwards as we've been marching.\nIf he doesn't, it's a big question of\nwhat is the what does the year look\nlike? Because at that point, it really\nchanges the dynamic of the tactics going\ninto the rest of the series. Trying to\nthink if I'd be happy with second again\ntomorrow. I think so. Also think I had\nthe legs to win.\nUm, and I think that at the end of the\nday, beating Keegan into the first race\nwould do a lot more damage than beating\nhim anywhere else. You have to believe\nyou can win this. You can't just show up\nand ride strong. I think it's hard to\nlook yourself in the mirror sometimes\nand remind yourself that you can.\nAll right, ladies and gentlemen, we want\nto welcome everyone to the opening round\nof the 2024 Lifetime Grand Prix. We are\nThe Sea Otter vibe is intense. Uh the\nbeginning of the lifetime Grand Prix is\nalways something that I\nthink you can just feel the tension in\nthe air.\nI love racing. I love figuring out what\nthe best path forward is for me. I love\nsettling into a race and kind of\nfiguring out where everyone else is. And\nso I kind of I think that's what I've\nmissed training the last 4 months is any\nkind of tactical awareness. You can just\nride and look at a power meter all day,\nbut there's no fun in that. First time a\nskin tube for the year is always a eye\nopenener. I feel good. Got my bag full\nof uh feed and it's going to be a good\nday. We're running up and down the\ntrack. Everyone's doing the exact same\nthing trying to warm up. It's hard to\nnot get caught in looking around and\nfiguring out or questioning how strong\nsomeone is based on some little warm-up\nsprint they just did. And at the end of\nend of that intense moment, there's\nreally about 4 and 1/2 to 5 minutes that\ndictate how your race is going to go.\nGuys, I'm going to have down the middle\nin the middle cuz they're coming from\nthe back. I think Matt Beers will\nanimate the race the most. Treky's\nprobably going well coming from\nAustralia. Feel like Russell and Keegan\nare always going well coming from\nTucson. Everyone else is kind of an up\nin the air unknown. The first 5 miles\nwill be very telling. Nothing changes\nonce the gun goes off. It's just the\npreparation beforehand.\nThe start of Seattle was ballistic. It\nwas almost slow motion. It's poetic in a\nway because it it feels like you're\nbarely moving, but the first half lap,\nyou have no idea what happened. Almost.\nWe start with about a two-minute climb\nup the race car track and immediately\ndump into a dirt road that was wide\nenough for two to three people, but\nthere's really only one racing line\nbecause of how slippery it is. And so, a\nlot of us had been quite worried about\nwhat that might mean for a start with\n140 guys. So, I slotted in well. I came\ninto the pinch point in fourth and kind\nof just focused on not crashing. That\nwas the entire goal for the first 5\nmiles of the race. All the way down to\nthe bottom of the canyon before we\nstarted climbing. It was just how how\ncan we get down there safely and then\nstart riding? Um, and a bunch of bunch\nof guys had the same thought. Matt and I\nwere kind of in the same place. Matt\nBeers went to the front right when we\ngot to the bottom of the canyon and\nstarted climbing hard. Um, just\nwhittleled the group down to a size that\nwas manageable and we were in control\nof a lot of the almost all the animation\nin the race happened on lookout. We went\npretty dang hard up it every lap and we\ntook a new entrance to it that went up\nabout a 15 and 12% 1/4 mile track. It\nwas pretty\nhorrible. Every lap that whittleled down\nvery quickly. The first lap I think we\nprobably had at least 50 guys and we\nwhittleled it down to seven by the top\nas we came through the start finish. To\nbe honest, I didn't notice that much\nwhen it actually started splintering or\nsplitting. Um, in these races, I'm so\nfocused on exactly how I can stay at the\nfront of that washing machine. The group\nmoves so quickly that I really am just\nfocused on getting back to the front if\nI drift back more than 10 wheels. So, I\nvery rarely ever look back. And with\nabout 8 miles to go coming out the\nsingle track, uh, I saw Matt Beers roll\non the left and so I decided to go on\nthe right and we ended up in a\nbreakaway. It was just the two of us\nwith a bunch of guys not wanting to work\nwith Keegan and I was like this is\ngreat. Alexi Vermullen causing another\nbig split. He's got Matt Beers on the\nwheel. Both riders taking a look\nclimbing up the climb um and I look back\nand Brendan Johnston and Keegan were\ncoming across the gap and they got there\nreally quickly. Um that was probably the\nfirst moment I was like, \"Oh, Keegan\nmight have looked like he's suffering a\nlittle bit. He's definitely still here.\"\nAnd from there it was just going to be a\ndog fight. Uh Keegan went in first, Matt\nBeer second, myself third, but it opened\nup into him kicking one more time on the\nlast pitch. Uh opening up another gap of\nmaybe 10 seconds. Um Matt passed me and\nI was kind of just trying to find that\nline of don't cramp, don't drop down to\neighth place, make it to the finish\nline, come into the venue, and have one\nmore little climb up\ncorkcrew. And so I just have this\npicture in my mind of like Keegan up\nfront and then I see Matt a little bit\nin front of me and then we're all just\nkind of riding the exact same tempo up\nand Keegan just sprinting all out over\nthe top and all I was thinking was don't\nworry dude, you got it now cuz nobody's\nmoving at all. It was exactly how I want\nraces to finish. Complete dog fight to\nthe end with a very worthy winner. King\nKeegan still stands at top. This is your\nmax\nchampion\nSwitzer second place finish. Third place\nfinisher now coming in Alexi Ver.\nWhat a great ride. Boss coming through\nfor eight. Hell of a ride.\nI got the slow-mo helmet. That's going\nto look good. You got it,\ndude. I can feel it coming. That last\nclimb. I was like, \"Oh, no.\" I thought I\ncould make it across the line, but it\ndidn't make it. It's all this water.\nJust like got the sloshy gut. What is\nwrong with you?\nMaybe a little too much work, but that\nwas a good bike race, man. It's just\njust chaos. Going really good. Having a\nlot of fun until I wasn't. That's\nracing. Yeah. to win the Grand Prix. I\nnow have to be Keegan at Unbound in my\nmind. I mean, it's not completely over\nafter that, but that's the easiest way\nis to stay on top going into June and\nJuly and Leadville. I need to have him\nthink about where I'm at. Nothing\nchanged very much. Uh I think we talked\nabout it yesterday, but I still believe\nif it's not Keegan, Matt Beers is the\nnext one who could possibly win the\nGrand Prix. So, you can't focus too hard\njust on one guy because I also got beat\nby another guy. Um, but it's a great\nplace to start. The Grand Prix is not\nbuilt on time. It's built on points.\nYeah. I think yesterday I said you can't\njust want to win. You have to believe\nyou can win.\nUm, and after today, I feel like that\nonly I only started believing more. It's\nracing to win that is going to allow me\nto win the Grand Prix. Um, and that's\nwhat I think I did today. And I think\nthat gives me a lot of confidence going\nforward in the next five races. Being up\nthere consistent throughout. It's a good\nstart. One down, five to go.",

our\nexpectations in terms of athletic\nperformance\nfor international interest Savage\nabsolutely Savage and the participation\nfrom all the everyday athletes it's a\nsea of lra here this morning in town you\nknow I think we're going to have a even\nmore competitive Series this year you\nknow both on the men's and women's side\nI think it's going to be I think it's\ngoing to be really interesting really\nDynamic if you thought seasons 1 and two\nwere exciting well I can tell you now\nthat you haven't seen anything yet\nseason 3 is here and we can't wait to\nkick this thing off with seasons 1 and\ntwo of call of a lifetime I think we\naccomplished everything we we ever could\nhave dreamed of\naccomplishing and I'd like to see us\nfigure out a way create even more\nconnectivity to these events and these\nathletes I'm Michelle Duffy Smith\noversee the marketing across the country\nfor Lifetime events this year for the\nlifetime Grand Prix we are doubling down\non our commitment to bring the home\naudience into the action all seven races\nwill be available to watch online within\n48 Hours of the event with extended\nhighlights and stories from the athletes\nwe want the viewer to feel like they are\nalong for the ride all season long and\nin addition to ramping up our live\ncoverage we've made a couple other\nchanges as\nwell for the first time our Elite men\nand Elite women's Fields will have\nseparate starts in all seven\nraces we've also increased the prize\npurse to a grand total of\n$300,000 so buckle up because season 3\nis here and we can't wait to see how the\nnext 6 months\n[Applause]\nunfold all right we're back at the\nLaguna sea Raceway and just about 15\nminutes out from the start of the race\nyou know the competition has been fierce\nin the first two seasons and there's a\nlot on the line for these athletes these\nraces and the coverage they receive\nprovides them with the kind of exposure\nthat can really give their careers a\nboost obviously there's a few names we\nexpect to see at the pointy end of the\nrace all season long but then there's\nthe rest of the field guys and girls who\nmaybe you're not as familiar with\neverybody has their own goals going into\nthis thing what is at stake how do you\ndeal with with the pressure we took a\nlittle time the last few days to catch\nup with some of these Riders and get\nsome of their thoughts as they embark on\na new season of the lifetime Grand\nPrix I'm Samar Shepard from New Zealand\num I'm so excited to be here racing the\nlifetime Grand Prix Series has\ndefinitely drawn a bit more more eyes to\nthe sport in the US which is super cool\nso I think it's you know getting used to\nlike you know being in the lineline a\nlittle bit more it's been so much hype\nabout it the last couple of years um the\ncoverage has been amazing and every\npodcast is talking about it I'm feeling\nas good as I felt in you know any of the\nthree years for sure the Imposter\nSyndrome has definitely been present\njust because last season I didn't ride\nwell if you just look at results and\nhave all the good training numbers all\nthe good training hours blah blah blah\nbut it doesn't matter unless you do it\non race day there's a quite a few women\nthat have you know freshly off of Cape\nepic and it's like I don't have that\nkind of\nFitness but I also know I'm so capable\nof more so it's been so special for the\nGrand Prix to believe in me and let me\nhave another chance at succeeding and\nthen on the other hand like I want a\nrace to to\nwin back again and uh really cool to be\nhere and see for sure something new and\nit's on the mountain bike Which is my\nkind of my true of I mean this race\nmeans a lot to me you know I've had had\na bunch of success here when I was\nyounger had a few dark dark races here\nwhere I kind of struggle to find the you\nknow find the Rhythm and find the power\nand the speed it's so competitive like\nI'm a drop bar you know climbing\nspecialist like even on this course on\nmy best day maybe I'll get 10th 15th I\nneed to remember to like make my heart\npump harder for those couple extra\nmoments and keep that contact with that\nwheel because it always lets up and then\nyou're there and I just don't want to\nmiss being\nthere more\nwins season 3 it's what I'm going\nfor all right everybody we know how we\ngot here we know what's at stake and we\nare just a moment away from the start\nin addition to our production crew stage\nall over the course we have Kimo Seymour\nand Janelle spilker up in the heli\nthey'll be our eyes in the sky today\nkeeping us informed on all the\nhappenings out there how do I become top\n10 in that save it save\nit don't go Ro save it we also have Tim\nJohnson and Lauren Hall following the\naction on ebikes and giving us updates\nfrom the ground\nso without further Ado let's get down to\nthe start line where our men are ready\nto get this thing going K and Janelle\ntake it away we are 30 seconds from the\nstart of the lifetime cran prie\npresented by Mazda the Fuego XL we want\nto wish all the Riders the best of luck\nout there Riders go you are underway the\nlifetime Grand Prix presented by Maza\nofficially underway and they're are\nan aggressive start just as we were\ntalking about you can see Lin Morton on\nthe right hand side and the pink colors\nof EF education Alexi veran also taking\nthe start uh kind of leading the way we\nsee Keegan there off just off about\nthird or fourth wheel back on the left\nhand side I need to channel aggression\nbe completely ready to explode as soon\nas the gun goes off and be battling for\nposition right into that first single\ntrack section we're going to see as they\nmake this next turn it's going to get a\nlittle steeper and you'll see them drop\nthe hammer there this is incredibly\nspread out there using every inch of\nroad because it is a fullon fight to get\nto the front heading into this hair pin\nhere you'll see them quickly come down\nto a choke point to me if you further\nthan 10th wheel it's it's not a good\nspot to be so main focus there don't get\nbox and sharpen the elbows a little bit\ngets to that pinch point just make sure\nyou top 10 would you know it Keegan's\ngoing to lead him into the turn it's\nkind of amazing we were watching Keegan\nsitting fourth fifth wheel and it's just\na couple of pedal Strokes puts him in\nfront of the entire field Keegan is\ngoing to be leading from the start will\nhe be leading at the end so the men have\nmade it out of the Laguna sea Raceway\nand established their pecking order in\nthe single track as always we'll\ncontinue to share our updates from the\ncourse as they hit the timing mats as\nwell as any live reports we received\nfrom our crew in the\nfield but now it's time to go back to\nthe start line and let the women duke it\nout for that oh so important positioning\nas they enter the single track Kemo and\nJanelle how's it looking from the sky\nthe big names on the start line this\nyear have already been called up we've\ngot Sophia Gomez visha F Alexis starda\nHaley Smith and Lauren de Kenzo a woman\nwho has taken to the start of the season\nwith multiple\nwins the sea otter start line is one of\nthe most stressful star lines of the\nseason because even though it's still a\npretty long race SE start to make a\nlittle bit of noise Riders go you are\nunder way a lot of it's decided in the\nfirst 3 minutes on the track and the\nwomen are off chemo just like we saw in\nthe men's race the women are full gas\nall across the\nroad galexis scarta up on the right hand\nside wasting no time to take the\nlead our Elite women's event officially\noff the line and we are rolling 68 miles\nbeginning right\nnow good to see the yellow and green\njersey there I think that's that's Peta\nMullen she's come over from Australia\nmulti-time national champion in I think\nthree disciplines so hia Gomez be our\nwinner of the Grand Prix last year\nwinner here last year in a time of 4\nhours and 55 minutes taking off the\nfront of the woman's pelaton going into\nthis right-and hairpin turn Kimo she has\na significant gap on the group with that\nattack and just like that the 2024\nlifetime Grand Prix presented by Mazda\nis underway you saw our lead men and\nwomen head into the Sandy climbs and\nflowy single track of the fort or\nNational Monument they'll continue to\nride for roughly 35 miles before we see\nthem again right here as they complete\nthe first of two laps for a closer look\nat the Fuego XL course we caught up with\nlongtime race director Jeff\nFrost Jeff knows this course and this\nrace better than anyone here's Jeff with\na deeper dive into the sea otter classic\nFuego XL and what what makes this race\ndifferent from any of the other stops on\nthe lifetime Grand\nPrix my name is Jeff Frost I'm the race\ndirector for the lifetime seot classic\nin Monterey\nCalifornia I've been designing and uh\nmaintaining building laying out courses\nfor 25 plus\nyears the sea otter classic Fuego XL I\nbegins and ends at the Laguna sea\nrace consists of two laps roughly 35\nmiles each set amongst the picturesque\nFort or National\nMonument the beginning of the race is a\nSprint around the Raceway that\nimmediately funnels into single track\neveryone wants to be first out of the\nRaceway because once you hit the single\ntrack you're pretty much locked into\nyour position until the course opens\nback\nup that happens after about 5 miles when\nthe course turns onto Gravel Road here\nyou'll see riders that didn't get that\nfront position try to make up some\nground from there it's a mix of Fire\nRoad old army roads dirt and gravel and\nsingle\ntrack the climbs are short and Punchy\nand the descents are\nfast we have timing mats set up at Miles\n13 and 16 then there's three miles of\ngravel road 2 miles of single track and\nit just keeps going like this\nback and\nforth and then after about 30 miles of\nthis the Riders turn on to Lookout Ridge\nRoad one of the most iconic sections of\nthe\ncourse it's a steep climb to the top and\nthen a fast descent back into Laguna sea\nfor either the completion of lap one or\nthe Finish to the\nrace April is beautiful here in Monteray\nand we're hoping for clear skies and\nrelatively cool temps for the world's\nlargest cycling f Festival the sea otter\nclassic okay thank you Jeff we have word\nfrom out on the course that our men are\nabout 8 km in there's a bit of a climb\nin the single track before they turn\nonto our first stretch of\ngravel Kimo and Janelle how's it looking\nout\nthere yes Bill we have our eyes on the\nleading men and you're right Keegan\nSwenson is still leading the pace yeah\nwe have Keegan in front Lance that is\nbehind him Alexi Braden Lang Cole and\nthere's Matt beers moving up in position\nyou know Janelle Matt beers came into\nthis race and he really uh he just came\noff winning Cape epic and uh I think he\ncomes in with some serious confidence he\nraced with Howie they both won and uh\npretty commanding fashion they looked\ngreat beers looks great this is a good\nway for him to put some points on the\nboard early this this\nseason I do like to be in control of the\nrace\nbecause then I'm not relying on how\nother people ride I'm a bit more of a\nsteady\nRider and we've got a rider who is not\ncontent to be sitting behind the riders\nthat he is taking that little side trail\nto the right they're coming into a\ndownhill section Teo and the fewer\npeople you have in front of you the less\nlikely that you're going to have\nsomething go wrong\nyou never quite know how people are\ngoing to be in a moment like if a single\ntrack like are they going to be focused\nare they going to make mistakes here\nthey go once they hit this gravel\nsection up here the speed is going to\npick up and they're really going to\nstart moving it's rather better for you\nto have the control I can see our ebike\nreporter down there Tim Johnson it looks\nlike he is in position to join the lead\nmen on this turn\nyeah here we go I'm chasing our lead men\non this section of\ngravel this is going to start moving\npretty fast here of course conditions\nare dry which as you know means the dirt\nsections can get\nslippery we'll see how the men handle\nthose conditions once we leave the\ngravel up here and get back on single\ntrack so Janelle Matt beers has come to\nthe front he's he's not content to sit\nin and just watch this race happen he\nwants to go up and make it happen looks\nlike Alexi might have gotten on his\nwheel Keegan Keegan sitting in third\nCole in fourth right now behind our\nleading 12 we've gotten 10 more Riders\nchasing on okay right up here this is\nwhere we're going to make a right hand\nturn back onto single track you know\nJanelle Keegan is just such a crafty\nRider you know he let Matt beers come to\nthe front pull him on that rolling\ndownhill and then what does he do right\nbefore the single track he jumps back to\nthe front he is just always so spot-on\nwith his tactics\nMo this course is notoriously dry rded\nfrom all the winter rains that\nCalifornia has seen so far this year and\nthen we'll often see a lot of loose dirt\non top that will act like ball bearing\nthese guys have to be careful they've\nbeen out on the course they've seen\nwhere there's dangerous spots where\nthere's been a lot of erosion but uh boy\nthey've got to be on their on their aame\ncuz it can get uh really dicey quick\nmother this stupid\nsport word from out on the course is\nthat it is dry and Dusty and the Riders\nare having to manage those conditions\nsome with more success than others and\nas the men are moving right along\nthrough Fort or Kimo and Janelle are\ngoing to split off and go catch up with\nwomen last we saw Sophia was off to a\nhot start Kemo and Janelle how are\nthings looking now yeah looks like we're\nseeing the same thing Bill Sophia Gomez\nhas a massive gap on five Chasers we saw\nHannah AO beating that chase and it\nlooked like Katarina Nash with Alexis\nscarta a part of that five woman chase\nthis is a 5our race for the women and so\nif you go out too hard you can really\nsuffer in lap two I don't think that\nthat is on Sophia's mind at all today as\nshe has taken the lead from turn one and\nclearly is not waiting around for the\ncompetition when you see someone take a\nflyer off the front you you know you\nhave to close the gap and close the gap\nfast you need to work with the Riders\naround you but the question is will it\nbecome too competitive within that pack\nto never quite make that jump it's like\ntrying to be a conductor with an\norchestra of different people with\ndifferent natural rhythms like you have\nto figure out how to get somebody who's\nslow and steady to stay on with somebody\nwho's Punchy or somebody who's Punchy to\nkind of keep it steady I just heard from\nLauren Hall who's with the bead women\nlet's check in with her to see what\nshe's been seeing on the ground I feel\nlike we' barely begun the day and Sophia\nvishaan is gone miles gone she has just\nleft everybody else to chase uh no\nconversation right I mean it is a\nblistering Pace right now so we'll see\nif this uh is going to say for the day\nthanks for that Lauren K what do you\nthink the likelihood is that Sophia went\nout a little bit too fast today and that\nshe's going to be reeled in by this\nChase group of strong five women you\nknow knowing her uh her her results thus\nfar this year I'd say the likelihood is\npretty low but we have some very\nexperienced riders in this Chase group\nof five that is Hannah aotto leading the\ngroup you have Alexis scarta on her\nwheel and it looks like Jenna rinhart\nwho has had a very strong start to the\nseason last year I faded in the last\nfive miles and lost a couple spots and\nthat was kind of my theme last year with\nmaybe not getting my nutrition perfect\nand fading a lot so I just want to have\na clean race has some strong\nperformances under her belt but you can\ntell talking to her that she is really\nhungry for a top finish in the lifetime\nGrand Prix presented by Mazda okay thank\nyou Kemo and Janelle so as our women are\nout there jockeying for position it\nwon't be much longer before our men are\nnearing the end of lap one which if\nyou've seen the Elite field race as SE\notter before you know there's one\nsection of this course that really can\nseparate the tenders from The Pretenders\nwe mentioned it earlier it is of course\nLookout Ridge for more on the iconic\nclimb here's Michelle Duffy with a\nbreakdown on this pivotal section of the\nFuego\nXL this course is very different than\nthe rad it's very different than Unbound\nthis is going to be fast aggressive\nracing constant climbing descents blind\nturns and no part is more consequential\nthan the final climb on Lookout\nRidge it's about 2 1/2 M and 800 ft of\nelevation gain at 15%\ngrades water runoff has carved deep\ntrenches into the Sandy surface making\nit so Riders will be single file at\ntimes as they navigate their way around\nthose\nruts there are spectators up there\npeople banging on drums and the views\nare insane it's the perfect place to\nmake an attack and a fitting finale to\nrace last year it was a lead group of\nKeegan swensson Russell finsterwald\nChristopher bevens and Cole Patton at\nthe bottom of the\nclimb Keegan made his attack and Russell\nwas the only one that could\nfollow it came down to a Sprint finish\nwith Keegan narrowly beating out Russell\nto claim the top\nspot it would Mark Keegan's second quo\nXL victory in a row after separating on\nLookout and coming in Solo in 2022\non the women's side last year it was\nSophia Gomez vishaan Alexis scarta Vera\nlucer and Haley Smith at the bottom of\nthe climb as soon as they started the\nascent Sophia hit the gas and was gone\nclearly she was\ndetermined if you remember two years ago\nSophia was in the lead group on Lookout\nwith Alexis scarta and the late Mo\nWilson that year it was Mo who found the\nextra gear and left Sophia behind\nso last year I don't think anyone was\nsurprised to see Sophia perform the way\nshe did she'd lost the race on Lookout\nonce before and there was no way she was\ngoing to let it happen\nagain so this year will Sophia and\nKeegan make a successful attack on\nLookout once\nagain or will we see another Contender\nemerge from the field to take the top\nspot here in\nmontere all eyes will be on Lookout\nRidge for that second lap to find out\nall right thank you Michelle I believe\nthe men are only moments away from\nLookout and Kimo and Janelle are in\nposition and ready to walk us through\nthe action but before we cut away we\njust wanted to take a moment and\nacknowledge the upcoming 2-year\nanniversary of Mo Wilson's passing you\njust saw her there in the footage when\nshe was the 2022 SE otter classic Fuego\nXL Champion it was an amazing ride and\nby all accounts she was an amazing\nperson so today if you would like to\nhonor the memory of Mo you can check out\nthe Mariah Wilson Foundation at Mariah\nWilson foundation.org\nthe foundation aims to promote healthy\nliving and community building by\nsupporting organizations dedicated to\nexpanding access to Recreation Sports\nand educational programs and coming up\nhere in a few weeks on May 11th the\nfoundation will host the second Annual\nRide for Mo fundraiser at The Wildflower\nInn in East Berke Vermont if you're in\nthe area come out to support the Mariah\nWilson Foundation with a couple gravel\nrides live music games and an amazing\nraffle and honor Mo by embracing a\ndifficult day with love that overcomes\nhate joy that overcomes grief and life\nthat overcomes\ndeath and with that we turn to you Kimo\nand Janelle for a look at the 2024\nFields first of two climbs up Lookout\nRidge the men have hit Lookout Ridge\njust under four miles to the Finish Line\nwe've got about 10 riders in this front\ngroup we've seen two Riders kind of\ndangling off the back but now there is\nabsolutely no place to hide both in\nterms of Fitness or in terms of visual\nI think they've maybe called a little\nbit of a truce nobody's really put the\nhammer down yet on this climb they know\nit's a long climb they also know they've\ngot to do this whole Loop one more\ntime hean on the front with Alexi ver\nMullan it's exciting to see Alexi off to\nsuch a strong start you know seat was\none of his throwaway races last\nyear at this point in the race in\nprevious years we've also seen much\nsmall groups and we have a dozen men in\nthis leading group and I think that this\nis just a testament to how much the\nGrand Prix is driving Riders to train\nthrough the winter and come into the\nseason ready for a\nfight Janelle this section of Lookout\nRidge Peaks out at about uh 10\n12% there was a lot of wash out with the\nrain this year but look at Alexi going\nto the front and uh driving the pace\nhere on this hill\nstarting to break the group apart the\nfirst one to get popped off the back\nhere looks like looks to be\npacing a couple of those those gaps that\nwere opening up I think is indicative of\nwhat we'll see when they come through\nthe first of the big climbs on lap two\nthey want to start the year strong you\nknow they they much rather put some\npoints on the board early in the year\nand uh give themselves a little bit of\ncushion it's really tough to uh to\ncompete in the in the lifetime Grand\nPrix for the full season if you don't\nstart out with with a result early\non they've got another short little\nclimb it's going to lead you know lead\nthem back into some single track they'll\ncross the track and then they'll drop\ndown just next to the cork screw out\nhere at WeatherTech Laguna sea\nRaceway this is that section of course\nthat we added from last year a lot of it\nis not really well groomed single track\nand it because of all the erosion the\nrange it can be really slick it's a\nquick descent and this is not the time\nto take risks this is not where the race\nis won but it certainly can be\nlost so as they're uh dumping onto the\ntrack here and going to head through the\nthe start finish and start the second\nlap how are they looking down there\nBill looks like we've got about 10 or 11\nriders coming through right now in that\nmen's lead group we saw Keegan Swenson\nup there in second wheel as they come\nthrough those Riders all single file\nlooking like a uh road\nbreakway with that let's turn our\nattention back to Lookout as the women\nhave now made the turn and are\napproaching the climb Kimo and Janelle\nhow's that lead group looking now as\nthey approach the end of lap\none just as they have dumped out on the\nbottom of Lookout Ridge we can see\nAlexis has closed that\nGap looks to be about 3 4 seconds down\non Sophia who's got two guys I think\njust been sitting on her wheel here for\na\nwhile always amazing to me how much\nSophia wants to control the race\nCas group it is a different story alarm\nbells are still going off this is an\nexcellent time for these women to be\nable to close down some time to our\nleading\nto so Janelle we're watching Alexis and\nSophia they're hitting the steepest part\nof this climb Peaks out at about 12%\nsuper loose and Sandy we saw the guys\ncome through earlier and the guys seem\nto kind of uh call a truce coming up\nthis hill we saw Pac come off the back a\nlittle bit it looks like these two\nthough are just going to they're content\nto hang together Alexa kind of hanging a\ncouple just a couple feet off the back\nof Sophia's wheel but uh they seem to be\ncontent to kind of ride this at\nTempo Alexis has played it smart worked\nto get across but then is just sitting\nin and probably giving herself a chance\nto recover riding a smart race\ntoday now back in the chase group we've\ngot Jenna Reinhardt dictating Pace along\nwith an experence erience of Aaron Huck\nwe've also got Sam Shepard I would\nimagine that Sam is really motivated to\ndo her first round of the lifetime Grand\nPrix and show how strong she has come\noff of the winter after racing Cape\nepic if Alexis is able to keep in\ncontact this is a fantastic situation\nfor the two of them as they come up and\nover the climb and head towards the\nsingle track on The Descent to the\ntrack all right we've got our leading\nwomen coming through right now that is\ngoing to be Sophia Gomez visha leading\nthe Char she's got the company of Alexis\nscarda with her as well so those two\nriders coming through in about 2 hours\nand 17 minutes or so so that is very\nvery fast\ntime somara Shepard coming through\nHannah Auto Aaron Huck Jen Reinhardt the\n36 seconds the Gap to our two\nleaders and there you have it your lead\nwomen have completed lap one here inside\nthe lagona sea\nRaceway you know know Laguna sea has\nbeen the home for the sea otter classic\nsince its Inception back in the early\n'90s for 34 years bike fans from all\nover the world have been making the\nannual pilgrimage to the Selenas Valley\nfor a bit more about the event here's\nJeff Frost once again with what he\nthinks makes the sea otter classic the\nevent of the\nseason sea otter is a fixture in the\nworld of cycling when we first started\nthe trade show was kind of a sideshow if\nyou will to the racing well now it hosts\n9,000 athletes and 74,000 fans so the\nrise has been meteoric you've got so\nmany different brands we're all super\npassionate about it and it's just so\nsick to see everyone come around and\ncome together and just promote the thing\nthat we all love it's the place to be\nit's the place to check out gear a lot\nof times it's the people that started\nthe company are here there's just so\nmuch going going on sort of like coella\nbut for\nbikes you know this is something where\nthe entire industry shows up and they're\nbringing all the newest gear in Tech and\nthe fans get opportunity to check all\nthis stuff out this year alone we have\nover 1,000 vendors in attendance which\nis a record here at se it's almost like\na reunion every year I might not go to\nas many races anymore but I know I'll\nprobably see all my buddies at sea\notter downhill practice for the juniors\nright now Wyatt 8 years old hello is uh\nracing downhill for his fourth year in a\nrow third I missed one well\nyeah when you walk away from the\nlifetime seaotter classic you go wow\nthat was cool I got to hang out with my\nbuddies I got to ride my bike and I got\nto walk around and see products that I\nhavn't known existed I mean if you're a\nfan of cycling and you have yet to\nexperience the sea otter classic it's\nsomething you simply have to do to truly\nappreciate how special this place\nis Amen to that so for those of you out\nthere in the crowd you've got about an\nhour or so before the elite men make\ntheir way back into the venue so go out\nthere grab a hot dog something to drink\nhigh five some budies and enjoy all that\nthe Expo has to offer and with that\nlet's kick it back out to our team in\nthe field for the latest on where things\nstand with the men at the Fuego\nXL thanks Bill our men are out here\nmaking their way through lap two we\nstill have a big lead group you have to\nimagine it's only a matter of time\nbefore someone starts to make a move and\nbreak this pack\nup when you're in a big group like this\nyou have to know that there's a lot of\nhorsepower that can chase attacks down\nso it's really challenging to make moves\nwith so many players in the\ngame you know we just caught back up\nwith our lead men it looks as though\nMatt beers is pushing the pace up this\nhill Lexi veran getting ready to take a\npull through and of course Keegan right\nthere sitting on his wheel so looks like\nthese three guys have have put a little\ngap on the rest of the group and uh they\nseem to be working together well you\nhave to be patient but you also need to\nre re the people you kind of figure out\nokay this gu is moving up the right now\nokay what's happening on the left in the\nmiddle kind of be very hyper aware of\nyour surroundings and\nthen use your common sense to kind of\nmake the right decision in that moment\nabout 5 Seconds back we've got a Chase\ngroup here with Cole Patton leading the\ncharge trying to make that bridge across\nHoward gr sitting there on his wheel\nlooks pretty comfortable on his wheel\nbut it's all happening\n1 minute 2 minutes it's a little bit of\ninstinct and also not\noverthinking they hit a little bit of a\ndescent here and Keegan decided to come\nto the front and try to shake it up he's\nputting a little gap on\nAlexi this year I'd like to not have it\ncome down to a Sprint if I can that was\na little bit stressful last year with\nRussell is just looks really comfortable\nspinning he so fluid and then you can\nsee Alexi back there on that straight\nsection rocking his shoulder much bigger\ngear grinding to try and get back on\nKeegan's wheel they know that they're\ncoming up to the climb to look out Ridge\nyou race enough and you know you've won\nenough races and had some success you\nyou start to like just get a sense of\nlike oh like these guys are hurting it's\nlike time to go or like if you have a\nsmall Gap like it's time to push hey so\nTim we saw you uh we out there on the\nebike caught back up to Matt beers how\nare things looking down there hey chemo\nthese guys are flying the downhill\nKeegan is making his move and Matt and\nAlexi are doing everything they can to\nkeep\nup I heard Alexi make a mistake and I\nwas like oh now we go it is so\nimpressive to see Keegan descending away\nfrom the other leaders in the field you\nknow they still only got about a\n5-second gap so it's the the race isn't\nover yet but Keegan sure does look solid\nright now as Racers we kind of call it\nlike snapping the\nelastic like you can snap the elastic\nthey can no longer see you then they\nthey start racing each other it makes it\nso hard mentally though to have let that\nGap go on a descent and to know that\nyou're going to have to chase down one\nof the strongest climbers that rides on\ndirt these days so you just need to like\nbreak them have like a small Gap and\nthen you can slowly build it um and\nreally just maintain it and I think that\ntakes a lot of time to kind of hone that\nlike steady\nthrottle and here goes Keegan\nmaking his way up Lookout I've gotten to\nbe a little better at that in the past\nI've like gone too hard and blown up or\nor whatnot so I think it's like it's a\nbit of an art to like learn how to how\nto do that but also like you know if the\nrace comes down and there's like three\nor four of us you also have to know how\nto win a race that\nway you know chemo for every one of\nthese athletes racing today racing near\nthe front they have to be constantly on\nwatch for what we talk about as being\nthe moment in in the race sometimes\nyou're the rider who can sense that the\nopportunity is there and it's yours for\nthe taking and you make the move and\nrecognize that you are in that moment\nand now Alexia is pulling away from Matt\nthis this is really blowing up here on\nLookout and that's that that Mark of the\nchampion all right SE otter what we're\nhearing out on the course is that Keegan\nswensson separated from the field on a\ndownhill section before Lookout Alexi\nand Matt were on the chase but I think\nwe all know at this point that you're\nnot going to catch Keegan on a climb at\nthe end of the race grab something to\ndrink and get on over to the Finish Line\nbecause Keegan should be entering Laguna\nsea any moment now it is ever so sweet\nto be able to put your hands up in the\nair and celebrate a solo win ladies and\ngentlemen he is just about onto the\npavement right now so we're going to\nmake a little bit of noise this guy is\nput on a phenomenal show beating his\ntime from last year SE meet the new boss\nthe same as he old bot this is Keegan\nsnon here we see Alexi veran coming in\nlooks like he's he's given about a\nminute up to Keegan but uh he's going to\ncome away with second place\npoints just behind him have Matt\nbe don't go anywhere we still got lots\nof finishers to come through as our\nElite women out there doing battle to\nsee who's going to be the queen of the\nhere\ntoday we're back here with our lead\nwomen and it's still Alexis and Sophia\ntogether in front Alexis put in that big\neffort to break away from the chase\ngroup and close the gap to Sophia yeah\nso now the question is how many matches\ndid she burn to do that and will she be\nable to hang with Sophia until the\nend there comes a moment in the race\nwhen you can feel that all of the\ntension is raised and that's when you\nreally have to start looking around and\ndeciding what strategy is going to suit\nyou\nB you can see Sophia and Alexis out\nthere and our Chasers look to be about a\nminute down if people are starting to\nhurt you can slowly start to ratchet up\nthe pace to make people start to\nquestion their will Hannah Auto in first\nwheel followed by Sam Shepard Aaron huff\nand Jenna Reinhardt looking very strong\nfast and smooth as they go through this\nsection of single\ntrack Alexis is looking for a\npool\nno our Chase group five women currently\nbeing led by Hannah\nAuto and Haley Smith sitting second\nwheel rejoining from behind as Sam\nShepard takes to the front with an\nattack and now so is pulling away from\nscarta sopia is smashing\nthis she looks to have put a couple\nminute Gap here on\nAlexis so showing everybody that she\nmeans business in the 2024 lifetime\nGrand Prix presented by Mazda Alexis\nstill in Pursuit and our group of five\nled by Hannah utto not far behind\nper my lungs are burning my legs are\nhurting My Mind Is Telling Me No stop\nlike I I don't want to feel\nthat but I'm telling myself push past\nthat push past that\nwall all right word on the street is\nthat it's Sophia out front solo after\nAlexis lost contact and she has a Chase\ngroup motoring right along it's setting\nup to be another Showdown on\nLookout sopia has made it up to Lookout\nRidge she has a pretty incredible\nGap oh there's Alexa\nCora this could be a battle for second\nand\nthird let's see if Hanah shelle see that\ntoo that's definitely going to be a\ncarrot for Sam and Hanah\nAO oh Alexa is just Alexis is just blown\nup being able to see a rider in front\nand chase them down is super motivating\neverything\nhurts but you're near the finish so you\nyou you just dig deep you keep pushing\nhard Sam's going for\nAlexis this is going to going to be\nit confidence comes from execution so\nwhen you're able to execute one thing\nwell you gain confidence and that\nconfidence allows you to execute\nsomething else well SE let's bring it up\na notch this is your Champion once again\nhere at seot welcome home Sophia Gomez\nvisha I just push hard\nyeah it just gives you another another\nlevel of energy and\nstrength and this is it Sam sheeper\nmaking contact with Alexis scara's wheel\nand going by not waiting for Alexis to\nbe able to jump back on Alexis out of\nthe saddle trying to maintain contact\nwith Sam Shepard wow chemo what a ride\nby the Kiwi ah 2K to go she catches her\nand she just blows by like she's\nstanding still doesn't even give her a\nchance to get on her wheel she knows to\nrace a bike and look at her on this hill\nshe is already opening up a gap and you\ncan see Alexis looks like she's already\nbacked off she to dig deep and to\novercome to deep the other Riders you\njust have to want it badly Camp Shephard\nwhat a solid first day for her in the\nGrand Prix here we have it Janelle\nHannah Auto just caught Alexa scarta\nwent by her again didn't even slow down\nlook at she's standing sprinting away so\nshe's now moved into third place and she\nis still gunning for Sam Shephard oh I\njust I feel absolutely for Alexa starter\nyou can see how deflated she is I\nprepared as well as I could have I put\nin everything I could to be on the start\nline so I wanted to make it worthwhile\nand my mind was not settling for less\nthan what I the best I could give on the\nday all right put your hands together\nhere what a phenomenal ride very happy\nso Shephard with that silver medal\nperformance here today taking a quick\nlook back over her shoulder she's going\nto see Hannah Auto in the distance uto\nwith a phenomenal ride picking up a\nbronze and a welcome home third place\nHannah\nAuto and our fourth place finisher Haley\nSmith at a late charge at the end of the\nrace and Alexis scarter rounding out the\ntop five what a phenomenal finish for\nall these\nwomen it was an all out grit your teeth\nkind of finish nothing quite brings on\nthe Ecstasy like that crossing the\nFinish Line knowing you definitely had\nto earn it your bronze medalist Hannah\nAuto I haven't raced many of these girls\nat all before so it's a bit of a see how\neveryone's going and um everyone's going\nreally fast it turns out she needs all\nalmost no introduction Sophia Gomez\nV the athletes here in the Grand Prix\njust keep bringing the level up every\nyear everyone's more prepared everyone\nis more focused in on these\nevents on today Matthew beard as a ro\nmve to the mountain bike slowly he\ntaking a couple years to even be able to\nfollow these guys through single track\nand hopefully slowly getting closer to\nscaring Keegan a little\nbit I know Sophia is also on another\nlevel so I think it's going to be a\nreally competitive season I'm excited\nabout it I love these events as they get\nharder and harder and I think that's\nkind of what you need as an after yeah I\ndon't know if the season is going to go\nwell but that's kind of\nexciting that was an incredible day of\nracing and such a proper start to what\npromises to be a season unlike any other\nnext up probably the most infamous\ndaunting event in the Grand Prix here's\nKimo Seymour once again to give us a\npreview of what we can expect to see on\nJune 1st at Unbound\ngravel one thing that makes this series\nso compelling is the diversity of races\nthese athletes are forced to\nface and that contrast couldn't be more\napparent than going from this course at\nsea otter to race number two the 200 Mi\nof rolling Flint Hills of Kansas at\nUnbound gravel fortunately these Riders\nhave till the end of May to train those\nlegs and tune their\nengines no matter how you feel about\nyour results here whether good or bad\nthere's no candy coating the challenge\nthat lies\nahead last year proved to be full of\nsurprises and a little drama both bikes\nand bodies\nfalter our riders with stood 10 to 13\nhours of crushing mud drenching rain and\nsweltering\nheat and they are all coming back for\nmore whether you're leaving seot or\nlooking for a comeback or Defending Your\nPosition everyone has their work cut out\nfor\nthem well that's it for us here in\nMonteray on behalf of Kimo Seymour\nJanelle spilker and the rest of our\nproduction team I'm Bill Ellison saying\nthank you for tuning in and we'll see\nyou next time in Emporia\nn\noh",

telling you dude\nafter the fact I'm just like really\nhappy to be on this ride because the\nspectrum is that I'm not doing 600 watts\nand getting dropped so even though it's\ndude sometimes racing above your\npaygrade could suck and it doesn't snot\nfun in the moment just adds richness and\ndepth to the rest of your rides and life\nlike when I got home hanging out with\nthe family just felt so good because I\nwasn't wasn't racing with those guys\na hundred percent have no clue where I'm\nparked I mean I'm like in this the area\nthe general area but there's just a sea\na sea of cars and like how many how many\nSprinter vans are here especially like\nall white\nI found it found dude it is makes you\nfeel like makes me feel like not a very\nspecial snowflake on a mic all got a six\nSprinter van and then there's just a sea\nof white Sprinter vans Scott gave me\nthis this bullet and then in Psych now\nit's it's it's jelly and peanut butter\npeanut butter and jelly just this is\nvegan what

call to come\nhome and relieve mama we're hanging out\nat the beach I'm gonna leave mom dude\nshe never sleeps like that so I left the\nmom out at the beach so she can just\nhang out and enjoy it as much as she\nwants she's not really that type of like\noutgoing type of person she's much more\nof like an introvert so she just did\ngive her a book sit her in a chair\nsomewhere nice that's what she wants to\ndo she loves that you know she's not\ntrying to go on a hike she's not trying\nto ride no bike she's not trying to you\nknow that so this is this is what she\nwants right now is to sit on

The course starts at Laguna Seca Raceway with a huge fast descent that makes riders nervous, followed by short intense climbs throughout. Key sections include Lookout Ridge, a steep 2.7-mile climb with technical single track that represents the most challenging part of the course. The race finishes with a critical 180-degree turn just 200 meters from the line, where positioning is crucial for victory. Located in Northern California right on the ocean, the race features cool cloudy conditions that may warm up as fog burns off. Riders face uncertainty with the new gravel format, requiring strategic decisions about wheel, tire, and gearing options. The course demands tactical thinking about pinch points and where attacks might happen, as no one has raced this particular gravel route before."
