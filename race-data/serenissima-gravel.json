      },
      "length": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Lutsenko's winning solo attack came with 80km remaining, sustaining \"3.5 hours of 100 percent full gas\" through the 132km parcours. The distance allows for tactical racing as Robin Froidevaux demonstrated in 2022, attacking 10km from home: \"I knew if I stayed with the group, it would be hard technically against the best on the last lap.\" Similar distance to Crusher in the Tushar."
      },
      "technicality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Lutsenko described \"very narrow roads and so many corners\" on the technical parcours, with 83% gravel surfaces including single-track through the Po Delta. Community observers noted sections \"so tight that even on a leisure ride on them, you'd have to single out,\" though the course lacks \"wide-open stretches of stones like those found in races Stateside.\" Less technical than The Mid South."
      },
      "elevation": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "The Po Delta and Villa Contarini terrain offers minimal climbing challenge, staying near sea level throughout the Veneto countryside. The 2000 feet over 65 miles reflects gentle agricultural landscape where tactical positioning on narrow gravel sectors matters more than climbing power. Flatter profile than Croatan Buck Fifty. As Robin Froidevaux puts it: \"For sure it was unexpected. I'm not too much of a gravel specialist and even in mountain bike, I'm not so good technically, but I took the opportunity and went on the attack.\""
      },
      "climate": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Mid-October in the Veneto region typically delivers stable gravel conditions before winter sets in. The Po Delta climate stays moderate during late autumn, though the coastal proximity near Porto Barricata and agricultural valleys can create variable micro-weather across the changing course layouts. Similar climate challenges to SBT GRVL."
      },
      "altitude": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Racing from the Po Delta through Villa Contarini keeps the entire route at essentially sea level elevation. The coastal start points near Venice and agricultural finish locations maintain consistent low altitude throughout, making oxygen availability irrelevant to race outcomes. Lower altitude than Gravel Worlds — no thin-air concerns."
      },
      "adventure": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "The race traverses through Treviso \"a city of 100,000 inhabitants\" entirely on gravel roads, showcasing ancient Veneto charm around the 16th-century Villa Contarini. TheBlaaMan noted the \"beautiful but nuts\" nature of racing on footpaths outside houses at \"40-50kmph,\" delivering cultural immersion beyond typical gravel events."
      },
      "prestige": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "As the \"first-ever pro-only gravel event on the calendar\" created by Milano-Sanremo winner Filippo Pozzato, the race attracts WorldTour talent like Lutsenko and Hermans from teams including Astana-Premier Tech and Alpecin-Deceuninck. However, the small 40-rider fields limit its broader impact in professional cycling hierarchy."
      },
      "race_quality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "The no-radio, self-supported format creates pure racing dynamics, with Lutsenko describing choosing his tactic as \"Alexey, go as fast as you can\" without team communication. However, scalability issues emerge - community observers noted \"no way are you getting a full peloton of 200 on those roads\" due to extreme sector narrowness."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "The stripped-down racing format eliminates team cars and radios, forcing self-reliance that Lutsenko described as \"a feeling that I hadn't felt in a long time.\" Riccardo Minali captured the essence: \"It was a difficult race, but we really had fun. I'm looking forward to participating in more gravel races in the future!\""
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Giuseppe Martinelli's enthusiasm - \"It is a new but so nice race which must go on in the next years\" - reflects broader professional reception to the innovative format. The race attracts pros seeking \"the cycling of the past\" heroic style, though the inaugural gender equity issue drew criticism from Alison Tetrick about excluding women from \"MY sport.\""
      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "WorldTour teams bring serious depth with Astana-Premier Tech, Cofidis, and Alpecin-Deceuninck participating alongside Italian ProTeams. The small ~40-rider fields concentrate talent effectively, though Macy0161 noted that with larger pelotons \"it becomes more about the fight for position on the tarmac sections entering the sectors.\" Less competitive depth than Almanzo 100."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "The pro-only format with WorldTour participation creates distinctive racing unavailable elsewhere in gravel. Part of Pozzato's four-race \"Ride the Wonderland\" series, organizers aim to \"create a stadium atmosphere\" where spectators can see multiple race stages, with future plans including starts from Piazza San Marco."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Registration runs €60-100. Venice proximity inflates accommodation costs in one of Europe's most expensive tourist regions. The race requires premium equipment like Lutsenko's \"brand new: almost literally fresh out of the factory\" Wilier Rave SLR, while Filippo Pozzato uses custom Passoni titanium frames with \"same geometry as when I was racing\" - reflecting the professional-grade investment expected. Higher total cost than Badlands."

          "description": "Partenza lungo la ciclabile che costeggia il Terraglio per immergerci poi nelle campagne che ci portano nel il Bosco di Mestre tra Dese e Favaro Veneto. Si possono ammirare specie arboree tipiche della pianura tra il Bosco Franca, Ottolenghi e Zaher. \nNell’ ultima parte, vicino al Dese, si incontra Forte Cosenz, in cemento armato, il primo dei tanti forti che ammireremo. Furono costruiti dall’800 in difesa di Venezia quello che è conosciuto come il Campo Trincerato di Mestre.\nUna volta abbandonate queste strutture militari, sono andate per lo più nell’ abbandono e ricoperte dalla vegetazione.\nSi prosegue verso Forte Bazzera nella zona di Tessera, questa é la parte di percorso dove manca una vera pista ciclabile ma la strada non è particolarmente trafficata.\nQuesto forte è l’unica polveriera giunta fino ai giorni nostri.\nDa qui inizia uno dei tratti più belli: una ciclabile sterrata che costeggia la laguna e a vista si notano i campanili della città di Venezia.\nSuperata l’ idrovora e Passo Campalto si raggiunge velocemente Parco San Giuliano, uno dei più grandi d’ Europa.\nAttraversando il ponte ciclopedonale e viale San Marco si arriva a Forte Marghera.\nFu costruito dagli austriaci è terminato poi dai francesi. È il primo esemplare di fortificazione a difesa di Venezia e del suo arsenale e uno dei più maestosi.\nAll’interno si può sostare in uno dei tanti locali carini o visitare i Mici del Forte, un’ associazione locale che si prende cura dei gatti abbandonati.\nPrendiamo poi la ciclabile lungo via Torino, il sottopasso della stazione per arrivare a Marghera.\nAttraversiamo poi la Romea grazie al sottopasso e proseguiamo tra territori agresti.\nLungo il percorso si può ammirare la Torre Colombara in stile gotico risalente alla prima metà del XIX secolo.\nFacendo un po’ di attenzione dove termina la strada secondaria, sulla destra si prosegue verso Forte Tron. Si gira intorno alla vegetazione che lo copre interamente fino a scoprirlo, quasi come un tesoro nascosto. \nÈ il gemello di Forte Capenedo e Forte Gazzera. È ora un’oasi di protezione della flora e della fauna che l’hanno colonizzato.\nSi continua verso Oriago per giungere a Forte Gazzera tra il Marzenego e il Dosa. Ogni prima domenica del mese è aperto per la visita.\nSi continua per arrivare a Zelarino e in località Gatta dove si trova il Forte Mezzacapo dove non è più visibile il fossato che è stato interrato. Era stato costruito nel 1911 per controllare la strada per Treviso e la ferrovia per Udine.\nDa qui lungo una piacevole ciclabile si torna facilmente al parcheggio per concludere questo piacevole itinerario.\n\nDistanza percorsa: 62 km  | Dislivello: 130 m | Tempo di percorrenza: 3 h  30 m  | Adatto Gravel, Mtb,  E-bike\n\n🚲 #cervelo \n👕 Completo sportivo #sportful\n🪖#kask Protone\n🕶 #oakleysunglasses Sutro S\n⌚️#iwatch\n🧭 #garmin 830\n🎥 #insta360 Go 2\n\nTraccia:\nCon una piccola donazione di 5€ mi aiuti a sostenere il canale compresa lo studio della traccia e l'elaborazione del video, lascio il link qui sotto:\nhttps://www.paypal.com/paypalme/nonsologravelandre\nLasciatemi mail su paypal per l'invio della traccia in formato Gpx.\n\nFacebook:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100083534816221\n\nInstagram:\nhttps://instagram.com/nonsologravelandre?igshid=YzAyZWRlMzg=",
