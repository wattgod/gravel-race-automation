You'll need a rental car because public transport to Nannup doesn't exist for cyclists with bike boxes. The saving grace is camping at the event village, which is the authentic way anyway, and Margaret River is only 45 minutes if you need actual beds."

        "explanation": "78 miles sounds reasonable until you realize it's 3,200m of climbing through pine plantations on parallel singletrack. This isn't a distance game—it's a suffering-per-kilometer optimization problem. The mileage is modest but the terrain makes it feel twice as long."
      },
      "technicality": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "These aren't wide gravel highways—they're essentially two tire tracks through state forests with sharp quartz grit that slices thin sidewalls. The Crucible hits 20% gradients on loose surface, and the parallel singletrack means constant line choice through narrow, winding sectors. You need reinforced sidewalls and actual bike handling skills, not just fitness."

        "explanation": "10,500 feet in 78 miles is a climber's nightmare with 12-13 categorized climbs including The Crucible's 20% gradients. The climbing ratio here rivals rigorous mountain stages, which is why everyone runs mullet drivetrains with 50-52t granny gears. Standard 1:1 ratios leave mortals walking."
      },
      "climate": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Australian autumn means cool 45°F mornings warming to pleasant 70°F days—no outback furnace here. May marks the start of wet season with 600mm annual rainfall, so rain can turn clay sections slick and make descents sketchy. It's actually civilized weather, which is probably why this race attracts 1,500 masochists."
      },
      "altitude": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Nannup sits in Western Australia's coastal forests, not the mountains. You're dealing with rolling terrain through pine plantations and state forests, so oxygen isn't your enemy here. The elevation gain comes from constant undulations, not thin air."
      },
      "adventure": {
        "score": 5,
        "explanation": "The official survival guide warns about kangaroo, emu, and wild pig collisions on silent descents through active logging areas with zero cell signal. You're reliant on moto marshals in genuine wilderness where wildlife can end your race violently. This is proper adventure cycling with real consequences, not manicured gravel theater."
