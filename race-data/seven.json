The saving grace is camping at the event village, which is the authentic way anyway, and Margaret River is only 45 minutes if you need actual beds."

The Crucible hits 20% gradients on loose surface, and the parallel singletrack means constant line choice through narrow, winding sectors. You need reinforced sidewalls and actual bike handling skills, not just fitness. More technical than most — comparable to Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego. As Surface Description puts it: \"The 2026 route has no single track and no fire trails. All the roads used in SEVEN are unpaved and well-formed with a mix of dirt, gravel, hard-packed clay, quartz grit and mica.\""

The climbing ratio here rivals rigorous mountain stages, which is why everyone runs mullet drivetrains with 50-52t granny gears. Standard 1:1 ratios leave mortals walking. Among the hilliest in gravel, comparable to Badlands. As Climbs puts it: \"Ten major climbs of SEVEN are amongst the best that the State has to offer. These climbs range in length from 1.2km to 4.5km long with gradients frequently touching on 20%.\""

        "explanation": "Australian autumn means cool 45°F mornings warming to pleasant 70°F days—no outback furnace here. May marks the start of wet season with 600mm annual rainfall, so rain can turn clay sections slick and make descents sketchy. It's actually civilized weather, which is probably why this race attracts 1,500 masochists. Similar climate challenges to SBT GRVL."

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Nannup sits in Western Australia's coastal forests, not the mountains.

Modest altitude compared to Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

        "explanation": "The official survival guide warns about kangaroo, emu, and wild pig collisions on silent descents through active logging areas with zero cell signal.

          "transcript": "[Music]\nWelcome to Nanab in Western Australia\nfor seven, the biggest gravel race in\nthe Southern Hemisphere. There are over\n1,600 people registered for the race\ntomorrow, principally because next year\nthis will hold the world championships.\nThere are four different course options.\nSeven, which is 125 km with 3,200 meters\nof climbing. Five, which is 85 km and\nnearly 2,000 m of climbing. And then you\nhave three at 47 km and 1,25 m of\nclimbing. And one, which is 27 km with\nnearly 500 m of climbing.\nSo once again, I've brought Jenna along.\nWhy did you want to come with me this\ntime, Jenna? Um, I wanted to come back\nto Nanup cuz I'd been once before for a\nroad race. Um, I just like to say yes to\nthings. Michelle likes to rope me into\nthings, so that's why I'm here. Yeah.\nAnd it's going to be a really awesome\nday tomorrow. If it's anything like the\nweather today, then tomorrow will be\nfabulous. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah.\nHere we go. 6:40 in the morning and it's\nactually not that cold. How you feeling,\nJenna? That's really good. Yeah, I'm\nexcited. It's going to be a really fun\nday.\nToday was the goal was to ride well, not\nsmash ourselves, but ride to a nice\npace and stay upright. Yeah.\nOvertaking lots of people on their\nebikes. Yeah, we took lots of ebikes\nactually. Yeah. And we the the goal of\nthe the day was to not push in crazy\nfast because we knew people were going\nto be around us and we didn't want to\ncrash and the start is obviously the\nmost chaotic part of the course.\nLuckily, it did spread\nout. Ready to hit the\ndirt. It's going to be a long day. Yeah.\nI was so excited for Brockman's at the\nfarm track. What did you think? I'm torn\nbetween like it was clearly stunning,\nbut I expected when I saw the 22% I was\nabsolutely peing, but it was actually\nmuch better than I expected. I thought\nthere I wasn't going to get up a 22%\nclimb.\nWoohoo. So, how is Broman, Jenna? It\nlooks like you're eating right now.\nThat was good. Yeah. Pretty. Dropped a\nmarbar. Dropped a marbar. Lost my lip\nbalm. Had to rescue that. Best stop for\nthe Mars bar. Yeah.\nBut the surfaces going down were\nparticularly sketchy. The gravel was\nreally, really loose. Yeah. Really\nloose. And it will just dry, which I\nguess makes it loose. Yeah.\nI'm learning to pick a line and stick\nwith it. Y cuz there were a few times\nthat I felt a bit out of my comfort\nzone, but I was like, well, if I just go\nstraight, I'll be fine. Mhm. Except when\nthere was like a right hand turn and\nyou're like you're like\nYeah.\nI don't generally like to stop very\noften when I'm riding because the\nstopping time is what makes the ride\ntime longer. But I needed to go for a\nwee at the top of Lake Crucible Crucible\nand there was no port so I had to go\nbushwe. So I went almost halfway. Yeah.\nPretty good. just under. Mhm. Actually,\na bish\nbushwe in problems. What's that for? I\nnever need a wee. I needed a wei today.\nUm\num and I think actually that worked out\nquite well. I think doing it earlier and\nthen we just kept going further in the\ntrack. We didn't need to stop at the\nmain stop at Lana Cottages, but it was\ngood to see so many people there.\nWhere's the elite feed?\nYou said before that you were happiest\nclimbing. Correct. I did say that at one\npoint. Yes.\nCan you remember what the constant\nclimbs felt like? You don't get much\nrest in the downhill, do you? Cuz you've\ngot to really concentrate. Yeah. Yeah.\nBut then you've got to go from one climb\nto another climb to another climb. And\nsome of the climbs aren't even\nclassified on as a climb. Yeah. I think\nwhat I meant by that\nwas that I feel in control. Yep. When\nI'm climbing and in that I can sit into\na pace. Well, when you're not slipping\nagainst your wheel, I feel in control\ngoing uphill cuz I'm not going to\noutspeed myself. That's for sure.\nWhereas going downhill, I'm not a very\nconfident descender because of the dry\nconditions and loose gravel. I just feel\nless in control.\nIs this where we walk? Yeah. Oh,\nactually those speed bumps were fun. Oh,\nthose speed bumps were I I didn't enjoy\nthose. I mean, I'm glad we knew they\nlike I was like, \"Oh, that's 53ks.\"\nYeah. And then I was like, \"Oh, there\nwas a caution.\" Yeah. Yeah. I enjoyed\nthem knowing what they were once we got\nthere. Yeah. Yeah.\nI enjoy the descending. I'm feel like\nI'm getting a little bit better, but I\nfeel more in control, I think. Yeah. The\nmore you do the descents here on the\nloose stuff, it comes back to like, you\nknow, like, oh, actually, I know it's\ngoing to be really loose. There's a\ncorner coming up. Slow down. Whereas\nnormally, if it was a bit grippier,\nyou'd be able to go a little bit faster.\nYeah. Yeah, cuz some of those right hand\nturns or left hand turns, whatever they\nwere, you like a few of them coming\nalmost to a dead stop before turning,\njust waves of pebbles.\nNo, now I'm smiling and it's not\nreal. Out of the climbs we did do,\nBrockman's will always be my favorite. I\nlove broccolins. I think the sun like\nlike the time of day just makes it\nstunning.\nCan you remember any of the clampers\nyou've liked? Uh none of them.\nWe have just over 20k left to go.\nSome of the elite riders were coming\nthrough, so we had to make sure we stay\non the left. Come on,\nTiff. Come on, Talia. We don't\nnecessarily want to be on the left, but\npicking your line through those sections\nwas I think it was all right cuz there\nwasn't many people, but you do have to\nbe careful there.\nI really want to be able to do this. I\ndon't I hate getting off and\nparticularly when it's not steep. It was\njust so so loose. And then I had to run\nand then the guy behind me I was like I\ncome stop paying and he's like oh good I\ncan get off as well cuz he was\nstruggling. I slipped about three or\nfour times on that hill and that's\nunusual. I mean you can you do lose grip\ngoing up but that wasn't I think that\nwas a particularly bad\none. And then we did the ridge line as\nwe came back down towards Waverly Bridge\nthe sharp right to the really last\ndescent. Oh, like with the grass like\nthe last 10k caves. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.\nThat was beautiful. Like that's where\nit's got green like greener again\nlike greeny pastures and stuff and then\nthat was that really sketchy descent but\nyeah it was pretty loose and then we\ncrossed Wavely Bridge and then we're\nback onto the stuff we tested yesterday\nand it was just home run then. Yeah. And\nI felt really comfortable on that cuz\nI've seen it. Yeah. So it just\ncompletely eases any anxiety I think. A\n10k to go, Jenna. Almost there. Very\nhappy. So happy. Yeah.\nThen we hit the single track where we\nwere told to make sure we let elite\nriders pass us. That was a bit scary.\nYeah, cuz it was a single track and\nthere was a lot of riders back. So,\nwe're in the bushes for a fair bit of\nthat. I feel I was like, if we got to\npunch it there now, we say water. Yeah,\njust coming through the that last bit in\nthe village around the campsite was so\nnice to have people cheering and stuff\nand yeah, nice vibe. It was a really\ngreat vibe and a really good way to\nfinish the day off.\nDo you think you would ever come back\nand do the bigger event?\nYes. you. Yeah. Yeah. Cool.\nI've got neat chin.\nSo, our official distance was 88 km, a\nlittle bit extra. Um 2,100 m of\nclimbing. Our official time was 4 hours\nand 46. My intensity factor was8. But\nyeah, overall we worked pretty hard to\nget round in the time we did. At one\npoint I was like, I'm glad I'm not doing\nseven, but actually I kind of feel like\nI should try and qualify and come and\nrace the World Championships. We'll have\nto see whether myself and Jenna do\nthat. I hope you enjoyed learning about\nthe seven gravel race and the five\nadventures me myself and Jenna had\ntoday.

Unfortunately, my legs weren’t ready for the over-geared setup on the new  bike, which made some climbs tougher than my MTB. The extra effort led to leg cramps on long climbs, forcing me to take several breaks while I silently suffered on the side of the trail—LOL. Despite the challenges, I loved the race, the stunning views, and the vibrant atmosphere. I’m already planning to return with a mullet drivetrain setup and more training to conquer it next time.\n\nTime: 7h31m\nPace: 16.6km/h",

          "transcript": "hello and welcome this is seven gravel\nrace the gravel season has well and\ntruly kicked off but I tell you what\nthis is the big dance so take a look\n[Music]\naround we're back to qualify for the UCI\ngravel World Championships and this\nmorning these Riders are stering down\nthe barrel of Seven's grueling\ncourse 12 5 km on the menu and 12\ncategorized climbs for the Riders to\ntackle 3200 M of elevation gain and this\nis anything but\neasy it's time to get stuck in who's\ngoing to be the new 2024 champions of\nthe biggest gravel race in Australia\nlet's find\nout perfect conditions here in n Western\nAustralia now Riders on the start line\ngetting ready for one of the most\nprestigious gravel races in the\ncountry focused and ready 2\none we begin with a neutral start out of\nthe town of Nana the Riders taking a\nchance to chat shop and talk about their\nsetups for today's event Trey always\nlooking very very focused\nthe bridge marks the start of the race\nand today we're going to be covering the\nwomen's Elite you can see the Australian\nchamp Justin Barrow on the left and here\nis Annabelle fiser the Swiss Rider she\nhas the GoPro which will be seeing a lot\nof\ntoday you can see the volume of riders\nis very compact as they're heading\ntowards the first sector of gravel and\nreally the Quasi start of the race as\nthey turn right here on course and for\nthe women it is so important to stay in\ninside those front 30 Wheels this first\ngravel sector is chaotic there is riders\ncoming back moving forwards changing\nlines because the surface is not always\neven as we see\nhere we can see cassia BOGO one of the\nfavorites is just staying tidily in the\nbunch the Riders here are about to enter\nthe first major descent and this really\nstretches out the pelaton just with the\ndifferent abilities and confidence\nit's a chance to catch your breath as\nyou get a bit more space around you but\nyou still have to stay focused right is\nalready getting Mechanicals trying to\nget a bit of draft at this point is\nsuper important and again all the things\nyou need to be looking out for as they\nhead towards the little rise and look at\nthis the lines disappear and you can be\npushed\noff Justin Barrow in the center of the\nscreen in very good position and this is\nwhere the race settles down a touch as\nthey head towards the first major climb\nof the day I talked with some of the\nfavorites yesterday so let's hear what\nthey had to\nsay okay and where do you want me to\nlook you okay oh look at you I'd like to\nwin I don't do this because I want to\nhave fun it's not\nfun we're such a small field mixed in\nwith men you won't necessarily even know\nwhere your competitors are but there's\nsome damn quality there isn't there\nthere will be three four girls that are\nclose but I don't see it staying\ntogether to the end no\nway if you're wondering where the women\nare right now they're in this Valley\nbehind me and at the base of the climb\nyou can see Justine Barrow coming into\nour field of view and we're on board\nwith Annabelle\nfiser oh\nno [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]\nno Annabelle fish's chain has been\njammed in the chain\ncatcher we have to catch I had a problem\nplease help me out in the front knowing\nshe's lost a lot of ground here she's\ntrying to use the Riders around her to\nbring her back to the front of the race\nbecause the pelaton has already entered\nthe first climb of the day\nAnnabelle is now making a maximum effort\nhere to move her way back up through the\nfield and get to the front of the race\nyou see Peter Mullins on the left hand\nside how many girls here two this is\nshe's trying to figure out where she is\non the course right now with respect to\nthe other Elite\nwomen it's busy through here there's\ntraffic we can see Kate Bonnet on the\nright hand side and again picking off\nRiders one by one don't forget this is a\nmaximum effort here that she is using in\na very early moment of the race let's go\nto the top of the climb\nnow here is the front of the women's\nElite and it is Justine Barrow who is\npushing on she is renowned for being one\nof the best and strongest climbers in\nAustralia and not only is she at the\nfront of the women's race but she's also\ntowards the porting in of the men's\nright\nnow further back down the CL we have\ncassia boglio sitting in position two\nover the top meanwhile Annabelle Fisher\nwho had the mechanical has made a lot of\nground but she still has plenty of work\nto do so\nni right this\ntime let's\ngo as an elite female in this race\nyou're going to be surrounded by men all\nday h i you're bringing up just the\nwhole topic our race will will largely\nbe decided by the men that being said\nyou've got to have the skill and the\ntactics to hang with the right men but\nif you make an effort you know get away\nand then your competitors brought back\nto you by men totally changes the the\nrace think she's there think she's\nthere thank you Annabelle fiser finally\ncatches position two on the road Cass\nabogo who looks behind see her in the\ndistance Annabelle rolls up behind and\nnow passes CIA to get into position two\non the road and here comes a local\nstrong time trialist Lee Balden who says\nhop on and this is the moment Annabelle\nholds the wheel where Casio does\nnot but it's tough work\nhey\nhey in position two now there is still a\nlot of work to\ndo and look who we have just there in\nthe green and gold Annabelle has made\nthe catch and now position one and two\nare in the same group on\ncourse back in position three Cassio\nboglio has not given up and she's\nlooking for Riders to help her move\nforward and catch our\nleaders we're at kilm 51 and if you're\nwondering what fast gravel means take\nlook at the surface this is what about\n25 mil of rain the night before does to\na gravel course this is beautiful and\nsmooth and hard packed and fast all the\nloose rocks washed away down into the\ncvit here and that makes for smooth and\nfast\nracing and this is a perfect example of\nthe advantage it is for being in a large\ngroup like this Justine and Annabelle\nare in this group and they are happy to\nshare the workload and keep the race in\nspeed high it's a big Advantage back to\nposition three CIA who was on her own\nnow at this point Annabelle and Justine\nhave not acknowledged each other in the\nrace so this is the first time they\ncommunicate if you have the mechanical I\nwill not accelerate but I can't\nstop kilm 61 and the race has really\nestablished now and I'll tell you what\nI'm out of breath I've just run up the\nhill we have got amazing scenes here the\nresting mist and fog and this is what\nseven grael race is all about a hidden\nWonderland full of\nclimbs there's no change to the front of\nthe race here with the women's Elite\nthey're still pushing on and working\nhard on the climbs to extend their\nlead cashia BOGO the hometown hero here\nin third position she is now up to 3\nminutes behind this group and doesn't\nhave the advantage of a group of 2025 to\nhelp her Roll\nAlong this race means more to me than\nother ones Podium cast real goal is to\ndo one better than last year a few\nthings have changed for me in like the\nlast 9 months I think things started\nclicking a bit having a lot more race\nexperience now I'm more confident\nknowing what my limits are and having a\nbit more belief in myself I think it's a\nlonely road in P3 for cassia boglia\nright now but she is not up at our home\nrace back at the front we've had a\nchange in the lead it is now Annabelle\nfiser who is in position one and just as\nthey're descending down this beautiful\nRoad take a look around at this amazing\nscenery now gravel cycling is\nunpredictable a Mechanicals can happen\nat any moment and this is what happened\nto Justine Barrow she is 25 seconds back\nnow from the lead and she's trying to\ndescend her way back on everyone would\nknow uh technicality is um not my\nstrength I like to try and control the\ncontrollables and sometimes I don't\nrealize things that may be out of my\ncontrol Justine bar is now having to go\nout of their comfort zone to catch the\nleaders who are just down the end of the\nroad now we're at kilm 80 and we're\nstanding at the base of AAS Creek it's 2\nkm in length at 9% gradient and have a\nlook at this Justine Barrow the\nAustralian gravel Champion is now back\nin the lead and this time Annabelle\nfiser is nowhere to be seen she's in her\nelement on one of the toughest climbs in\nthe race and not only is she breaking\naway from Annabel but she's breaking\naway from anyone in\nsight 25\nseconds yeah\nwe're at the highest point for seven\ngravel race right here and it is the\nAustralian gravel Champion Justine\nBarrow who has finally broken away from\nAnnabelle fer she's now solo the time\nGap around 45 seconds Justine now to\nAnnabelle fiser from Switzerland and\nshe's waiting to try and pull back the\nGap she won a Time TR in Spain a few\nweeks ago and she might need to pull\nsome of that ago one week ago she's\ngoing to need to dig deep\nand for the first time today Annabelle\nfiser is now on her own in position\ntwo perhaps the efforts at the start of\nthis race are starting to take its\ntoll it's kilm 100 Justine bar the\nAustralian champ has extended her lead\nto over a minute and there's still\nplenty of elevation left in this race so\nif you're feeling good you can take back\na lot of time but if the legs have\nfallen away you can lose just as much\nand here is cassia all of a sudden she's\nstarting to look really good a smile on\nher face and the power in her legs is\nobvious she's got 25ks to go to catch\nAnnabelle for second\nplace and now we leave the course to see\nour winner cross the line first\n[Applause]\nback ladies and\ngentl you are a champion\nit was tough from the the start um\nAnnabelle and I came together a few\ntimes and then I dropped my chain and\nwas separated but managed to get back\nJustine also set a new course record for\nthe women's Elite race and this was her\nfirst win in the national colors and now\nwho is going to take second place\nthe second place the hometown star I\nfelt pretty rubbish to be honest today\nbut that second C in after about 3 and\nhalf 4 hours it certainly did as cassia\nrode an insane last 30 km to claw back\nAnnabelle and take second place on the\npodium for the second year in a\nrow and here is our third place finisher\nAnnabelle Fisher and what a journey\nshe's had in this race\nI've done everything i' I mean I've won\ntracker I've won Rich I've won octopus\nI've won the final I won the series and\nthis has been the most enjoyable Park\nit's been wonderful it's been absolutely\nbeautiful it's uh if anyone needs to\nknow how to run a\nrace\ndo it's a beautiful sport you can get\nwrapped up in the race aspect or this is\nhurting aspect but just want to cross\nthat Finishing Line with nothing left in\nthe tank 481 races like this if you do\nget a result a lot of opportunity comes\nfrom that for me doing well at this race\nlast year sort of started this whole\ngravel thing and a good result here\nwould open some more doors for\nme rolling over the Finish Line first\nwould be worth it but it is a small\nfield so probably just stay safe and\nlook after each other and have\nfun we're all done and dusted here at\nthe seven gravel race the women's Elite\nhas been excited it is absolutely top\nEchelon of\ntalent the men's Elite race was won by\nBrandon triy Johnston Mark Chong in\nsecond and Brendan David in third it's\nbeen great having you here watching\nalong with us and we can't wait to see\nyou as we journey towards the World\nChampionships here at nup in 2026",

OK OK, it might not be the full 126km 3000+ brutal climb of the full SEVEN UCI event, but the FIVE is still nothing to scoff at. It was a journey to hell and back and was definitely one of the hardest things I've done in my life. But the process of preparing and training, setting up the gear and getting out there was truly awesome and exciting.

          "transcript": "[Music]\n7. So this is how it starts. Is it\nmorning of the day before?\nYep, that's right.\nJust waiting for our food to come.\nThat's where the real work starts.\nHere's all the supplies, all the gear.\nNutella. We've got killer pythons. Don't\nrealize you need so much stuff just for\none person to go around the track. What\nwas that? The most important thing. That\nis performance fuel right there. And uh\nwe can't forget the bike. I mean, that's\nalso going to kind of be\nimportant. All right, the bike is loaded\nup and ready to go. So, off we go.\nWhere are we? Just arrived in Bustleton\nat the accommodation. Did your boat make\nit here safely? Made it here with one\npiece. So, I must be doing something\nright. And then now we're going to head\ndown to Nanup and register.\nAre you excited?\nI'm quite nervous. Are you? Yeah. Why?\nbecause I rolled my ankle the other day\nwhile running and uh I'm sure those\nsocks will help it. It still hasn't 100%\nhealed. So, I'm a bit nervous that it's\ngoing to hamper me\ntomorrow, but besides that, feeling\ngood. Feeling strong. I don't think\nthere's a room for a bike.\nWho needs a TV when you can just watch a\nbike?\nJust just filmed that so I could pretend\nthat I actually went through the finish\nline if I didn't actually make it\nthrough the finish line.\nThank you very much.\nSo, we got the race number here.\nIt's got some safety pins here to my\nclothes. And it's got a um cable tie.\nCable tie to the bike survival guide.\nSomething you definitely need for\ntomorrow.\nAll right. So, we just registered in Nat\nfor tomorrow. The lady there was quite\nhelpful. She cleared up some questions\nthat we had around the food drops\nsituation.\nSo, um, it was a bit unclear on exactly\nhow it worked, but you can drop off your\nfood in a bag labeled with your number\nand then they take it out to the halfway\nstop and then when you get to the\nhalfway stop, you can find your food uh\nwith the number. They'll lay it out for\nyou there. Um, but Jess is going to be\nmy swa.\nSo that takes out a lot of the\ncomplication with that system. She can\njust hand me the food\nthere. Heading back to Bustleton now\nbecause we are staying there which is\nabout 45 minutes from\nNanup. I would suggest if you can get in\nearlier to register and get a place\nthat's closer is probably better cuz it\nis quite a drive even to Bustleton. Uh\nit doesn't look like much on the map,\nbut when it comes to coming all the way\nout here to register, it would be good\nto just be able to stay in the town. Um\nbut you have to get in early because the\naccommodation does book\nout pretty quickly.\nAgreed.\nSee you in 5 hours. All right. Enjoy.\nAll right. So, off I went to the waiting\nbay where 300 other participants in my\ncategory were waiting.\nRace started at 7:00 a.m. and we went 2\nminutes after the last seven rider went.\nThere I\ngo. Bit of a cruisy start. It's on a\npatch of road for a few\nKS. Everyone's pacing\nthemselves. Then we hit the\ngravel. There was a little climb at the\nstart. Nothing too crazy.\nAnd then that's when we got to\nsee the start of the epic\nscenery. This part of the world at this\ntime of day just looked magical.\nI was making some good passes here, but\nthen I got cut off and thrown into the\ncorrugated bumps.\nI did my best to get out of there as\nquickly as I\ncould and\nrecovered. Just check out the amazing\nviews on this\ndescent. Absolutely\ncrazy and really fun to ride as well.\nYou can get some serious speed.\nThe gravel was really smooth in this\nsection. It's really nice to ride on.\nNot too many ruts or bumps.\nPlenty of green grass and\ncows. Just check out that\nscenery. Camera doesn't really do it\njustice. It was pretty\namazing. This is the Brockman climb. The\nfirst really hard one. And it was really\nhard.\nThe scenery is so nice. Kind of took the\nedge off it a\nbit. It didn't seem as brutal as it\nshould\nbe. But at times I was really\nstruggling. Who put this bloody hill? Of\ncourse people had to push their bikes.\nSome fell off trying to climb, losing\ntraction.\nThere were some tricky bits, as they\nwere called, that were marked out in the\ncourse. I took that as an opportunity to\nmake some\npasses. Maybe I was a bit naive, but\nevery time I saw a tricky bit, I thought\nthat was a time to actually send it.\nThis is the only section of flat ground\nI remember on the course. It's about 50\nm and the rest of it was just either\nuphill or\ndownhill. All right.\nagain. Look at those views on the\nleft. This part here was so fun to ride.\nWinding descents down the hill, picking\nup a lot of speed. Damn, son.\nHow amazing is the course? Look at those\ntrees.\nI caught up to the guys in front of me,\nbut I was a bit bit too timid to pass\nthis guy in front. Watching the video\nnow, I should have\npassed. There's a pretty pretty tough\nclimb here, but you get some pretty good\nviews,\ntoo. This is one of those epic epic\ndescents. You pick up a lot of speed and\nyou're just barreling down this valley.\nI don't know if you can really see up\nahead, but it's like foggy down in the\nvalley and it's just like it feels like\na video game or something. It's very\nsurreal feeling.\nI think this is where I maxed out my\nspeed around 61ks an\nhour. I didn't quite realize I was going\nthat fast cuz the adrenaline kind of\ntook over, but you look down at the\nspeedo and it's like, wow, they're\nreally moving.\nSorry about the water tube in the way\nthere. You can see the fog on the side\nthere. People stopped to take\nphotos. And there were some pretty\nsketchy parts of this\ndescent. It wasn't all smooth.\nNow we're coming up to the halfway\npoint. How far until the cottages? Do\nyou know? Three. Three. Okay, thanks.\nMy GoPro wasn't filming when I stopped\nhalfway. Jess got some footage of the\nhalfway\npoint.\nAnd this is where it started to get\nreally quite suffering in terms of leg\nand back pain.\nAll\nright. Check out this fat bike.\nAll right. I'm 50ks in and uh yeah, now\neverything really hurts. My back, my\nlegs, ligaments here and there. Feel\nwhere it's all uh yeah,\n50ks pain time.\n25ks to go at this point.\nThis was definitely the uh toughest part\nof it. I was getting a bit emotional at\ntimes actually. It was like pushing me\nto the edge.\njust putting up with the pain in my leg\nand my back and just grinding my way\nthrough it. There was no sign of a\nsecond wind until I got passed by\nTiffany\nCromwell and she was flying. So, I\nthought I knew that she'd be in the top\nplacing. So, I thought it would be funny\nif I could come through the finish line\nbehind her.\nBut that was a pretty futile attempt\nbecause she was way too\nfast. This did give me a second wind\nthough and uh I was able to finish\nstrong. Thanks.\n[Applause]\nFlying through the single track section\nfelt really fast at this point. I think\nthe adrenaline\njust covered up all my leg pains.\nI caught up to the rider in front of me.\nI didn't really stop and appreciate this\npart of the track. I was just gunning it\nat this point.\nRider let me pass. Thank you. Sorry for\nthe shakiness, but I was really\nsprinting hard at this point.\nAdrenaline was high, emotions were\nhigh. I thought I would just sprint\nthrough the finish line at this point.\nSo, I'm giving it all the power I can\nonly to realize that I actually have to\ndo a lap around the caravan park. So,\nthat by the time I even get to the\nfinish line, I'm like already pretty\ngassed. Finally, the finish line came\nand I completed my first gravel event.\nWe are very happy.\nAnd I was pretty naked at this point.\nYou film me a video. Yeah. Taking a\nphoto. How'd you go? Huh? How'd you go?\nYeah. Good. It's very hard.\nIt's very, very hard. My leg started\nhurting here at about 30ks. So for like\n50ks I was just every head of\nstroke painful as\nBut yeah, after a while I got I got my\nsecond win\nabout 1K before the end.\nYou\nare where are you? You're number 105\nwith a time of 43855.\nGood job. Thank you.\nWhat you got here? A fisherman's basket\nfor\ntwo dogs.\nLet's go to the ugly part. Um Oh,\nalready.\nYeah. Oh, I just had a bit of a niggling\npain emerge in my left knee. So, I\nrolled my ankle the other day while\nrunning and that was really worrying me.\nI thought that was going to be a big\nproblem cuz my left ankle and foot is\nquite sore to walk on and stuff, but\nthat was literally not even a\nfactor. Um, and then my left knee was\nplaying up. My right knee was playing up\nthroughout the week and then that\nmiraculously healed itself this morning\nand we had no problems with that. But my\nleft knee, the ligament or something,\ntendon or whatever was so painful and\njust made everything a lot more\ndifficult except descending. Descending\nwas pretty good. Just my back, my my my\nright back also hurt. So, I was just\npushing through the pain of those two uh\nthings was the big challenge for pretty\nmuch the whole thing. Uh kind of slowed\nme down really. Um, I was taking the\nclimbs pretty easily and and whatnot.\nBut, uh, overall recap, uh, it was quite\ndifficult. Kind of felt like I went to\nhell and back. Was getting kind of\nemotional towards the end. Was trying\ntrying not to cry at times. Um, I don't\nknow how people do the long the long\none. Um, the 126 km. So my timing that I\nended up at was what? 4 hours and 38\nminutes. 4 hours and 38 minutes. The\nevent overall. Yeah. It was like really\nhard and actually quite painful in time\nat times, but it was like a mix of good\nand bad. It's like type two fun is the\nbest way to describe it.\nSo this brings my story to a close. Are\nyou going to do it again next year?\nI'll think about\nit. Maybe if I get\nsome a leg transplant in a back\ntransplant, I can do it.",

The course starts with a chaotic first gravel sector where the surface is uneven and riders get pushed off lines. Key challenges include loose, sketchy gravel on descents due to dry conditions, and the brutal Brockman climb with 22% gradients where some riders must walk. The first major descent stretches the peloton based on confidence levels. Riders emphasize staying in the front 30 wheels during early gravel sections and picking lines carefully on loose surfaces. The race offers stunning scenery through valleys with epic views, though cameras don't capture the full beauty. Over 1600 people registered, with perfect weather conditions. Course logistics include food drop bags at the halfway stop, and accommodation books out quickly requiring early registration."
