          "transcript": "hi everyone my name is Chris McQueen I\nam the series director for the i o\ngravel series and I wanted to give you a\nquick rundown on the course for Silver\nCity\n2023. this is just kind of a quick\noverview if you like surprises you can\ncompletely ignore this it's it's\noptional everything is going to be safe\nand wonderful on the route but if you\nlike a little Intel or maybe an Insider\npeek at what I was thinking as I put\nthis course together uh here here it is\nso as we start out from Silver City\nyou've got five miles of rollers right\noff the off the start and my suggestion\nfor anyone who is new or not really\nfocusing on racing Saturday is to take\nthese easy this is not the place where\nyou're going to win the race those being\ncompetitive I'm going to let you all\npick what it is you think that you need\nto focus on to to win your race you do\nyou but if you're\nI'm just out to have a good time I would\nsay that those first five miles are not\nwhere you want to spend all of your\nenergy after those first five miles you\nget a little bit of a reprieve and it\nkind of goes back and forth and it's\nit's very pleasant and then at this\nright turn is where your first class B\nroad is it's a fun quick drop and then a\nrise up to the other side you make a\nright on some pavement and then down\nagain on a Class B Road this then heads\nnorth\num fairly flat section here really\nreally Speedy do be careful of the\ntraffic right there it does cross a\npretty busy road and then this is\nanother class B road and it turned that\nthat road turns left and it's it's\nreally pretty it's all grass and\neverything it's it's one of my favorite\nsections and that's kind of a sign that\nyou're getting close to the first aid\nstation so this is\num near Macedonia and uh they've got a\ngreat uh pit toilet there good place to\nstop if stopping is your thing then\nyou've got a few more rollers as you\nhead north of town\num or or\nMacedonia and uh pass Henderson if I'm\nremembering right I might be getting my\ncities mixed up here but it's just a\nquick quick Buzz through town and then\nthis Begins the long sort of South\nheading section of the route and you're\npretty much just heading south the whole\ntime which is great if the ones coming\nfrom the north\num I'm not quite sure that's what we're\ngonna have here on Saturday but uh most\nof this is fairly flat with just a few\nrollers if you are a type that really\nloves your arrow bars this is a course\nfor you because you can really kind of\nhunker down for a good chunk of this and\nenjoy it right here is where it turns\ninto a Class B section again it's about\nfive miles or more of Class B for quite\na while there's a short one mile section\nI believe of just gravel and then it\nquickly transitions back to class B it's\nsome of the smoothest section of the\nwhole course even even smoother than\nsome of the pavement this last section\nright here is kind of a fun drop it did\nget torn up a little bit with some\nsomeone driving through the mud but it's\nit's not too bad\nnow you'll head back to um to the north\nhere and turn left past Willow slew this\nis where the second aid station will be\nthis is at about mile 45\nuh this is also the only aid station\nthat's for the uh the short course this\npart right here again is another class B\nsection you turn onto some pavement and\nthen yet again another class B section\nand then you wrap up uh all the class B\nsection for the the rest of the course\neverything else is gravel but starting\nright about not this turn but this turn\nat this turn this is where the gravel\nkind of gets crappy that section just\nright there it's not dangerous but it is\nsoft so I encourage you to to save some\nenergy for it it's going to take a\nlittle bit of work to get through those\nthat are racing please be careful as\nalways one suggestion that frankly I\nhave for those that aren't racing on\nSaturday is that right here is the trace\nand if you aren't up for these last\nthree hills on kind of soft gravel\nthere's no problem to take the trace if\nyou are not uh racing and by the by the\ntrace I mean the the uh the Wabash Trace\nsince it's right there so those are a\nfew quick tips you've got lots of Class\nB Road you got lots of uh straight\nsections\num and the and the big thing that I\nwould encourage you is if you're not\nracing don't try and and use all don't\ndon't go out too hard on those first\nfive miles of rollers and at the end if\nyou're if you're cooked\ntake the trace would be my suggestion\nbecause the last\noh three miles uh of of the course uh\nagain it's it's safe it's fine it's just\nsofter raked up gravel that I wasn't\navailable to really change the course in\na meaningful way uh without you know\nreally really adjusting the vast\nmajority of the course so for those\nracing uh you're welcome there's going\nto be a fun challenge there at the end\nfor those that aren't racing my\nsuggestion is take the trace in and\nenjoy that nice cool down so with that I\nhope you have a fantastic day can't wait\nto see you on Saturday and we'll catch\nyou later",

          "transcript": "hey everybody well thank you so much uh\nwe've got a group of fantastic folks\ntogether this is the my name is chris\nmcqueen and this is the first of maybe\nwho knows maybe more uh i don't know but\nwe're i'm calling it the iowa gravel\nseries uh podium podcast that's an\nopportunity for us to get together and\ntalk about racing from those that are\nstanding on the podium maybe learn a\nlittle bit from those folks so we're\ngonna\ndo a round of introductions uh i i'll uh\nkind of go first like i said my name is\nchris mcqueen i'm the race director i\nlive in glenwood iowa\non the far western side of iowa and\none of the questions that i kind of\nasked everybody as they introduced as\nthey introduced themselves is like why\ndid they get into gravel\nand\ni don't have a great answer for that um\nso maybe i'll but i'll probably get to\nanswer this question many times if i if\nwe end up doing this more\nbut uh my uh my reason for getting into\ngravel is because it's there it's like\nright out my front door i'm fortunate\nenough to live in the loess hills and\nit's really easy for me to get out\nand uh get on some gravel roads really\nreally fast and i love it like i grew up\nwith uh out west riding fire roads and\nit's just it's just the kind of it's the\nkind of writing that\nconnects me with my childhood so\nthat's a little bit about me we'll get\nmore into what this is and and maybe\nmore but let's go ahead and start with\nintroductions from the fine folks that\nwe have on here\nuh jonathan can you kick us off or\njonathan white live in council bluffs\niowa so a little bit north of chris and\nchris and i knew each other long before\nthe iowa gravel series\nso i race gravel because that's where\nthe races are if it were up to me it\nwould be crits\nbut the crits dried up and the gravel\nrace has started so that's why i'm doing\ngravel i guess it's safer than road but\nroot road is smoother and funner and\nmountain biking is pretty fun too\nso i do all three of them but gravel's a\ngood time as well\nthey pass it off to do i pass it off to\nsomeone else yeah go ahead and pass it\noff to someone else will surprise\neverybody claire\nokay my name is claire o'leary i live in\nminneapolis minnesota and i got in the\ngravel because i\ni started off bike racing in cyclocross\nand i started that on a sibling bet\nand gravel is just kind of the natural\nprogression for um you know the rest of\nthe year and and like jonathan said it's\nwhere the races are\nso did did you win the bet claire\num i don't know if it's necessarily\nwinning but occasionally i get texts\nfrom my brother that involve like i made\na monster\nso probably\nnice\nwell who would you pick next to\nfor um travis\nokay\nuh i'm travis lowens i live in omaha\nnebraska\num\nwhy gravel\ni think there's lots of reasons um\ni think the biggest one is that it's\nlike jonathan said it's a little bit\nsafer there's less traffic out there um\nit's accessible enough from here and\nto be honest just like claire and\njonathan said it's where the races are\nright now um there's a lot of them\nnearby\nthey keep popping up so\nit's there it also kind of suits my\npower profile a little bit better i'm\nnot no sprinter at all don't really have\na lot of high anaerobic capacity but i\ncan usually pull high tempo for a while\nso that usually works out okay for\ngravel\nlet's shoot on over to derek\nhi uh i'm derek henshide uh iowa city\niowa\ni kind of got into gravel just from like\npeer pressure and wanting to go to new\nareas it opens up some especially\ni mean just everywhere it opens up so\nmuch more\nplaces to ride which is great\num i haven't done any racing really\nbefore this i actually just started\nriding gravel last fall\num did it did a race and then kind of\ngot hooked with some local people\nso yeah are you are you still friends\nwith these folks that are that peer\npressured you into it derek um yeah\nyeah i mean it was a good move i think\num because i was\nyeah\nit's just been a lot of fun going all\nover the place to find new places to\nride\num how about uh phil\nhey so i'm phil seim i live just south\nof la crosse wisconsin so pretty close\nto minnesota\nuh nice gravel over there and also a few\nmiles three three four miles from my\nhouse i got some amazing gravel roads\ni got into gravel\nuh kind of the opposite of jonathan i\ndon't like crits and i don't like road\nracing\nit does crits for sure do not suit my\npower profile that punchy stuff\nis not me i i like to like put my head\ndown and just grind away at tempo for\n20 30 minutes and that's that's what i\nlove\nso that's why i got into it and i\ncouldn't see myself to anything else\nuh carrie anne\nall right so kyriann pappas i live in\nomaha nebraska\nactually came here from minneapolis\nclaire so nice to be back at my roots\num how i got into gravel i started in\nthe world of triathlon and after doing\nthat for i don't know six years eight\nyears\nrealized that i really was not a very\ngood swimmer and i really was a pretty\ngood cyclist and a pretty good runner so\ni've really focused on the cycling um\nthat's where my friends are that's where\ni've met great friends\num i think it's also partly my way of\nof reconnecting with\nmy farming background i grew up farming\nin north dakota and i just love to get\nout and see the countryside i love to\nsee different areas and definitely\ngravel lets you do that\nyeah i that that's\ngetting out and that that whole\nexploration thing and and just kind of\nbeing out in those in those more remote\nareas is something that's\nreally\nhelped me love it do you do you swim at\nall anymore or you you kind of stopped\nswimming\nno so um yeah\nthat was some of the notes i made when\nyou were talking about training is\ndefinitely still do\nbelieve in the multi-sport like i really\nthink that it's really good to have\nother sports to fall back on and\nswimming is one of those where it's very\nlow impact and to be a great cardio\nworkout\nso i do still i still do run swim bike\nlift all of that but um\nthis year especially only racing um only\nracing gravel okay well i might\nwe'll get more into training things like\nthat i've i definitely am a big fan of\nlike the multi-sport training and stuff\nbut it means that i'm crap at pretty\nmuch everything so\nuh\njust try to do my best\nall right well thank you again uh for\nbeing here and uh\nfor kind of kicking things off i wanna\nfor kind of our first few questions um\nuh i i want to touch on just just\nbriefly\ntraining and nutrition and gear and\nrecovery today i i did also throw out\nsome questions onto the socials and got\na few people out with some kind of very\nspecific questions and so if you have\nany insights on those i think i sent\nthose out to you ahead of time\nbut uh let's let's go ahead and start\noff with kind of like a little bit of a\na training overview\nuh i went and tried to stock your strava\na little bit\nand uh so i went out and and looked and\ntried to see what i could find and\nso i'm gonna i'm gonna start with\njonathan i'm gonna give him a little bit\nof crap because i think he's a liar\nso looking at his strava it says that he\nhas about\nmaybe a hundred miles a week and i think\nthat's complete bs like\njonathan what is three weeks i haven't\ndone 100 miles for sure oh yeah i\nhaven't touched my i haven't touched my\nbike but\nyeah for those that don't know uh and\nwe'll talk about this because we have a\nsection on on recovery um\njonathan had an unfortunate uh went down\nat unbound here three weeks ago and\nbroke his foot pretty bad\nso we'll\ndefinitely want to talk a little bit\nmore about that but here's my question\njonathan are you a phenom at only\nriding about 100 miles a week or are you\na complete liar on strava\nno i mean i was i was training for\nunbound and so i was putting in a lot of\ntime a lot of miles there's only really\none way to do that and that's to\nspend the time on the bike and so\nyear to date i did do a lot of riding\nand i don't hide anything on strava a\nlot of other racers will they won't put\nup their race rides because they think\nthat if\nthey think that if we know their power\nprofile somehow we'll be able to beat\nthem but i just put it all up\nso what what is your training\nlook like usually when you're not you\nknow broken and everything like what how\nmany miles and what what are you doing\nbeyond that it depends on what i'm\nprepping for and what bike i'm on so\ntypically i go by day of the week\nmonday is an average day i don't do\nanything hard just get the legs ready\nfor tuesday and wednesday tuesday and\nwednesday i'll do back-to-back hard\nrides whether that's\ni mean it depends on what i'm getting\nready for interval work\nor some hard laps at lewis and clark a\ntrack out here so i'll put in hard rides\nthose days and then i'll take thursday\noff\nand then friday is usually a shakeout\nride to get ready for whatever race i'm\ndoing on saturday\nand then i take sunday off as well so if\nyou're if you're doing if you're doing a\ncentury or 100 mile gravel ride and\nstuff how how many miles are you trying\nto put in during the week then\nso if i'm prepping for a hundred mile\ngravel ride i kind of think more about\nwhat kind of power am i going to put out\nso i'd probably focus a lot of time on\nmy sweet spot in the few weeks getting\nready for that that's kind of i don't i\ndon't remember i know what my number is\nbut i don't remember all the names in\nthe zones and so i i'd spend a lot of\ntime there\num just getting ready for what i think i\nwould need to do in that event but if\ni'm also getting ready for a mountain\nbike race\ni do a lot more higher intensity work so\nit kind of depends on what i'm tuning\nmyself up for okay cool well i want to\nhear from other folks as well so uh\ncarrie anne uh kind of going down my\nlist i don't i don't have it in any sort\nof order i could not find you on strava\ni don't know if you are\nif you're just a and that's fine if if\nyou're not a social person i don't think\ni i don't think everybody has to have\neverything on strava or whatever but i'm\ncurious uh hearing that you're a you\nknow triathlete what is your what does\nyour training week kind of look like and\nhow many miles are you trying to put in\nin the different areas yep so i'll start\nwith yeah you couldn't find me on strava\ni'm not there um\ni i just haven't succumbed to that\nsocial media force yet so maybe someday\num so from a mile percent\nit really varies i would say a lot like\njonathan just said like what is really\ncoming up um\ntypically i believe you can get a really\ngood workout in an hour so that hour you\nknow can get some really good intensity\num i probably am on my bike at least\nfour days a week\nuh maybe five say i don't have i don't\ngo by days maybe like jonathan did\ni'm more what does my week look like how\nam i bouncing that with my other sports\nthat i might be doing with public\ncommitments i might have\nso typically um\ndo any one easy ride one like group ride\nthat sort of fills my soul um it's not\nall easy it's not all hard but there's\nsome roadies that i love to ride with\nso get out with them\num try to go out then and do two other\nworkouts and that workout could be a\nrace this week it was a race weekend um\nand then i had done\num two like 12 minute intervals\non a road bike actually so i don't spend\nall my time on any one particular bike\nnecessarily either\num i guess i'm a believer that\nabout eighty percent of my work is going\nto be pretty easy down in that zone two\ntwenty percent of it's going to be up\nmaybe even above race intensity for me\nso hitting like a zone four or five um\nfor that 20\nis is kind of how i train\nnumber of miles wow um it varies it's\nall over the board from\nprobably over 300 sometimes to down\ncloser to\nyou know race 70 this weekend so it's\nprobably more like 120 mile a week this\nlast\nweek kind of tapering off just a little\nbit right before the race sort of thing\nyeah yeah and then you know 70 of it was\nrace so\ngotcha okay so yeah i kind of hit that\n80 20 as my big rule get get on the bike\nfour times a week big believer in our\nworkouts if that's what you've got make\nthe most of it i think you can get some\ngreat workouts in an hour\ngreat\noh well and we might we might come back\nto swimming and stuff but uh i want to\nget get kind of around the horn real\nquick travis\ni saw from you about 140 miles a week on\nyour strava\nand i didn't i didn't dig too hard i\ndidn't go\nweek by week everything but saw some\nzwifting in the winter and everything\nwhat how would you describe your your\nyour your training routine your weekly\ntraining routine\nyeah um\ni would say i'm about\nprobably 80 of my time is on zwift even\nduring the summer time uh just works\nbetter with my schedule um i can get up\nin the morning\nget an hour hour and a half in on zwift\num monday through friday\nmost of the time\num and saturdays are kind of my outdoor\nday so saturdays are generally\num anywhere two to four hours outside\nso yeah a lot of it's indoors it just\nworks really well for me it's a\ncontrolled environment too so that\nreally helps\nzwift has just been\nreally amazing for me\nas far as there's community on there as\nwell i do it three days a week mondays\nwednesdays and fridays i do a group ride\nin the mornings it's the uh kiss at base\nride if anyone wants to join\nit's a good group of people from all\naround the world um there's different\nlevels to uh levels of people to ride\nwith um\nso those are kind of like a group ride\nday i kind of pick either a sea ride if\ni want an easy day or maybe a b ride if\ni want more of like a tempo-ish kind of\nthe day\ntuesdays and thursdays are usually come\nwhen i are my hard days depending on\nwhat i'm looking at\ntraining wise where i'm at in the season\ni might be doing\nsweet spot and trying to push out my\ntime and zone and sweet spot or i might\neither get closer to race date work on\nvo2 max\ntype work really to get that high end\ngoing and then been trying to get some\nanaerobic capacity type stuff in as well\nbut that's usually closer to race date\nso\nyeah monday wednesdays fridays kind of a\nnice fun group ride tuesdays thursdays\nhard days saturdays are\nhard and long\nif i can\nwe could probably have a huge\nconversation about indoor training and\nand zwift in particular i i moved off of\nzwift and onto trainer road because i\nfound that i\ncould not stop racing with zwift like i\nwould get out there and like i could not\nkeep myself under control so trainer\nroad just made sure that i didn't do\nsomething stupid\nuh that's fair but but i love it i think\nit's beautiful it's totally fun all\nright claire let's head over to you i uh\nlooking at you i was seeing somewhere\naround 120 to 200 miles a week but also\ni saw some things that definitely\nimpressed me where i was like oh\nshe's got a sub four hour marathon time\non there and a 12 minute 5k run time\nso okay that's an error um\nthat was probably a bike and probably\nfrom years ago but continue and then\ni'll get it\ni saw i saw a little bit of zwift on\nthere and maybe some some gym uh rock\nclimbing indoor gym rock climbing stuff\nso um\nit looked like you're actually more of\nlike a three to one\nyou know three times as much run as much\nas bike so i'm curious what what kind of\nlike at least on zwift again i'm just\ni'm just going off of like i'm not on\nzwift on strava i saw\n1700 runs and 500 rides so i was like oh\nmaybe she's more of a runner\nso i'm a con\num i ran in high school in college after\nthat i did ultras i actually ran 50\nmiles before i ever rode 50 miles\num and then it kind of you know around\nor so 2018 2019 there was an overlap of\nyou know sibling heckling of buy a bike\nand do a real sport running is dumb with\nreally paying the price for some long\nchronic injuries that came up during\ncollege had surgery you know got through\nit but they kept coming back and dealing\nwith that and finally being like\nyou know i i can't run the way i want to\nanymore and hey biking is really fun and\nyou can race that too\nokay so what's your work what's your\nworkout week look like right now\num mondays are usually rest days\ntuesdays are going to be harder workouts\nperiod\nperiodized of like doing some like\nthreshold intervals now um\nand then it depending on how much time i\nhave maybe an hour to after the\nintervals to\nwednesdays are kind of a longish day\nthursday it's just an hour spin\nreally nice usually like to like wear a\nt-shirt or like go mess around on some\ntrails or go to where our local\ncyclocross races are and like invent a\nnew course in my head\num fridays are also interval workouts\nand then saturday and sunday is getting\nthe miles and the time when i can if i\ncan get out to gravel great um sometimes\nhit some group rides just a little bit\nof whatever the weekend looks like\ngotcha very cool all right\nall right let's get to let's get to\nderrick and phil real quick and then\nwe'll get into some some meteor\nquestions and stuff so derek\nso i saw what i saw was something around\n400 miles a week\nlike 20 hours 20 hours on the bike and i\nthink you said at the beginning you're\nlike i just kind of started into this\nthing like i'm just just new\nnew to gravel new to gravel i have like\ni said i never rode competitively but\ni've ridden and run for like the last 10\nyears i mean constantly on the road\num but yeah i'm putting in\ni don't have a real training plan i just\nride when i can\num which is i have a lot of time\num yeah\non tuesdays there's a group ride that's\na road group ride that's usually pretty\ncan get pretty hard that i try to join\nwhen i can but um\nwith my kids schedule and my wife's\nschedule i don't i usually can't make\nthat and like um travis said yeah i\nswift a lot just because it works with\nmy schedule like i can\nmy kids are old enough that they can\nplay with stuff and i can ride inside\nwhere\nand so that's when i get it in\nso i mean are you looking at maybe two\nhours uh you know a day sort of thing uh\neither on zwift or outside or in the\nmorning evening when when do you head\nout would be confident\nmost weekdays yeah it's somewhere around\ntwo hours um\na day\nand then on the weekends i'll do a lot a\nlonger ride like today i did with five\nhours\nuh wednesday is another i do a a more\nlaid-back group ride but um that's\npretty fun it's like our local gravel\ngroup ride\num and\nyeah i mean that that's pretty much like\ni said i don't have a plan really\num i've started like as i as i've now\nstarting to do things competitively\ni am like trying to maybe target\nspecific areas do workouts that target\nyou know my um you know vo2 and stuff\nlike that but\nyeah i don't\nthat's as structured as it gets\nwell i mean it's working because you you\nwon you won came in with a great time at\nwalk on and you know you're definitely\nputting the time in on the bike so you\nknow yeah so so good things are\nhappening\nuh phil i could not find you on strava i\ndon't know if you're are you there or\nare you i am\ni am i'm probably you have to request to\nfollow me i have some of my stuff hidden\ni don't know why just weird i guess\nbut yeah so i do i do like 150 to 200\nmiles a week on average um\nmondays and fridays are my rest days\nand then i'll try to do one to two hard\nrides a week so we have a local\nit's called tuesday night worlds\nand it's kind of like a race simulation\nso that's i count that as my intervals\nwhenever that's going on so that'd be my\nhard one of my hard days and then on my\neasier days i just do lots and lots of\nzone two\nuh so like endurance pace and that's\nusually for multiple hours and i've just\nfound that's\nthat's best for me for building fitness\nbecause i feel great the next day i can\ngo do it again\nyou know after intervals sometimes you'd\nfeel beat up and you didn't really\nreally get back on the bike i've noticed\nthat right away the next day so i can\njust go do zone two\nnext day just go do zone two again\nso that's what seems to work good for me\nwell that makes sense all right so uh i\ndon't want i wanna\nlike i said i'm still figuring out like\nhow to time all this and get us enough\ntime and this is kind of a big group\nthis is essentially two podiums this is\nbasically\nwalk-on and silver city\num so we got a lot of folks in here and\nso kind of lightning-ish round uh but\nnot not really i'm curious\nwhen was the first time you went from\nlike and this is going to be hard but i\nwanted to get this story in so as quick\nas you can i'm curious when did it go\nfrom like hey\ni'm riding a bike to oh\ni'm i'm going out and i'm racing my bike\nnow like when did that mental shift\nabout what age or what time frame did\nthat happen in your head where you're\nlike\nhey i'm a person that can ride a bike\nand i've been out on a bike and\neverything and now it's like no no i i'm\nriding a bike with purpose because i'm\ngonna go out and i'm gonna race\nso i'm gonna go kind of backwards here\nuh phil what when did that mind shift\nhappen to you do you remember that\nyeah so some like mid-30s now so i'd say\nprobably\n10 years ago so like 25-ish i was at one\nof these tuesday night rides and i it\nwas like my first time going to it and\none of the local\nyou know i guess local legends you go\ni'd call him just a really strong writer\nhe's like hey you're kind of you're\npretty strong rider you should you know\nyou should try some races and just see\nsee what happens so i i tried some crits\nlike i said i didn't enjoy crisp i did\npretty well so then i uh\nfound my passion and gravel but yeah\nit's yeah mid-20s and just luckily\nsomebody kind of said pushed me and said\nhey you kind of look like you're a\ndecent rider so maybe you should try\nthis\nokay so about five years ago that that\nshift derek how about you\nwell yeah it was a couple years ago\nlike i'm 33 now but a couple years ago\nwhere i kind of realized that i'm pretty\ngood on the bike but i never was\ninterested in competing until like i\nsaid last fall i started riding gravel i\ndid\na couple races a couple like sort of\nlike phil said a couple of local guys\nlike noticed\nthat i mean i took third place in my\nfirst race and i soloed 90 miles of it\nand almost caught the two league guys\nbut so one of those guys was the one who\nkind of was like hey you should join our\nteam and um from there that's when i\nstarted i guess being more competitive\nabout it yeah\nthat makes sense that that's that was\nactually one of my questions if there\nwas well we'll we'll get to that i guess\nwith the lightning round a little bit\nmore about like have you ever won a race\nwithout\nor got on a podium without training or\nprepping for it\num claire when did that shift happen in\nyour mind between like hey i\ni just ride or i just run but no i i'm\nout there to compete\nuh probably 2021 i did a little bit of\ncyclocross racing in 2019\nbut then um kind of the transition from\nrunning to\nreally like being more into biking and\nactually training on the bike and not\njust going out and punching around um\nreally kind of happened in like 2020 in\nthe 2021 took a lot of clinics for like\ncyclocross skills and and all those\noff-road handling skills\num and then kind of went from there\nso were you trying to compete when you\nwere doing the cycle across i mean were\nyou getting into it for fitness or were\nyou getting into it for to be\ncompetitive\num i wouldn't say those first races were\nvery competitive i took out a lot of\ntape um just like crashing into things\nbut\ni mean trying but at the same time\nwasn't really on the bike you know six\ndays a week or doing intervals or\nanything like that\nyeah okay very cool uh travis when did\nthat shift in your mind go from i ride\nto irace\ni started riding bikes\nas an adult and shoot 12\n11 years ago something like that\ni'm almost 42 now so it was i was 30 31\nwhen i started riding um just kind of\nriding around with my brother for a\nwhile and then\nhe was a lot faster than me and i wanted\nto get faster to just\nbe kind of his pace and\nthe training bug kind of hit me um i\nlike data and i like kind of\nfiguring those kinds of things out so\nthey started playing with that and\nlearning about training and then\ngot into racing and\nagain just the training and all that i\nactually probably like training more\nthan i do like racing sometimes um\nyeah it was maybe 11 12 or yeah 11 years\nago or so i did crits mountain bikes\ncyclocross stuff and now i just kind of\nsettle into gravel and zwift\nokay very cool\nuh carriane i i mean you you've\nyou've had quite a you have a lot of\nexperience in a couple different fields\nso uh\nyou can mention about the the writing\nand stuff but i'm interested about kind\nof the overall competitiveness for you\nso really started um\nriding actually in my 40s so lower end\nof my 40s i'm in the lower end of my 50s\nnow so i was probably about 11 12 years\nago that i really got into the triathlon\nside of things and riding my bike and\ndoing that for racing took a couple\nyears but\nhad success in that so i think that like\nthe mindset the shift there from just\nriding to racing was pretty quick\num from a\nbike perspective at first\nspecifically cycling\num it was probably about six years ago\nand i was on a group ride and and\nsimilar where somebody just encouraged\nme to jump in with the faster group of\nguys\nand it was like oh no no no i don't\nbelong with them and they're like no\njust go hang on as long as you can and\nyou know i think slowly that just built\nup my strength and probably my\nconfidence around cycling and it's still\none of those points where even i still\nride with a group of guys and they're\nlike yeah we remember that day just\nsuddenly you were there and it was but\nthat was like the confidence i think\ncame and i\ni had the fitness i'd been doing it for\nfive or six years\nbut didn't maybe have the confidence in\nthe bike handling skills and\nmaybe the endurance at that time and\nit's really grown from there over the\nsix years\nspecifically on gravel i'd say the shift\nwas probably around a little after\nclaire um so that's when i i really\nstarted focusing more on gravel and\ntraining even a lot more specifically\nfor cycling\nit's been a couple years\nit's it is super helpful to have that\ngroup to kind of say come on let's let's\ndo that and i think that's that's a\nreally good thing for gravel and cycling\nin general it's it is that it is a group\nthing\njonathan i i kind of imagine you came\nout of the womb competitively if you had\nhad a twin you probably would have\nelbowed that twin out but that's that's\njust my\nmy caricature of you know knowing you a\nlittle bit\nokay but tell me the truth when when did\nyou when did you go from like i'm doing\nsomething to no i need to win do you\nwhat do you remember\nso i i started racing bmx bikes when i\nwas 10.\nbecame a runner and then bought a road\nbike when i was 21 and raced later that\nyear it's never been a ride it's always\nbeen a race\nwell uh actually there's a guy i was\ntalking to just the other day wants to\nput in a big bmx track in council bluffs\nso we might need to chat about that and\nsee if we can figure out that'll be a\ngood way to get injured\neverybody's worried about crit races and\nwe're starting up bmx tracks\nall right well we've gone around the\nhorn a couple times so i'm gonna throw\nout some other questions that we got\nfrom the social groups and if if you\ndon't have any input or answers on these\nthings you know don't worry about you\ndon't don't need to chime in please do\nif you if you do have thoughts on this\nspecifically around training um there\nwere some questions about like people\nwere like hey what courtney neil asked\nyou know i can't get to crowd gravel all\nthe time what other training do you find\nhelpful so maybe any strong opinions\nfrom the group on what you feel is the\nmost helpful for specifically gravel\ntraining when you can't get to the\ni can take this since i live in\nminneapolis and the closest gravel is\nprobably 20 miles\num so just a lot of just road race or\nroad riding you know building strength\nthrough intervals\nand then as far as off-road handling\nskills even just you know doing\ncornering in a park and\nand stuff like i do for cyclocross and\nthen also riding mountain bike trails on\na drop bar bike\nsome of the more mellow ones but really\nunder biking things and getting used to\nwhat it feels like to\nto slide out you know really helps for\ngravel racing if you overcook a turn and\nall of a sudden your rear end is going\nout knowing how to save that is huge\nyeah no i think that's especially i like\nthe i like that going out and just being\non the mountain bike and anything else\nfrom the group on that one any\nsuggestions for courtney\nheadlifting\ndead lifting yeah getting in the in the\ngym how many just by kind of raise their\nhands how many of you do anything in the\ngym just weight stuff\njust dead lifting\num oh okay and do do any of you uh work\nwith a coach\nunless you count myself\neveryone's self-coached so i did one\nseason to kind of get a feel for how it\nis and then\nno one can coach you better than\nyourself if you know what you're doing\nfor me oh sorry oh no you're you're fine\nphil for those\ncoach yeah go ahead\ni'm just going to add on same thing i\ndid use coach for about a year and kind\nof learned what they had to offer and\nit's like okay a lot i learned got a lot\nof good knowledge but after that year\nit's like okay i think\nyou know i can kind of take this and run\nnow and change things up to while they\nwork for you based on that\nuh base knowledge\nyeah i'll probably take the opposite\nperspective on that if i could afford a\ncoach i would 100 get a coach\ni think\ni think you can delude yourself\nsometimes or you can maybe not do what\nyou really need to do because you don't\nreally like it\nand sometimes the accountability could\nbe good too\ni just it's just too much money for me\nto do it\nhas anyone done any like peer coaching\nwhere they've just maybe talked to a\nfriend sorry go ahead claire you had\nyour hand up\nhe's gonna say oh sorry i was just gonna\nsay i've done some of that peer coaching\ntype stuff and i'm i'm it's not that i\ncan't afford i just\ni haven't wanted to pay for a coach\nbecause but i do agree the\naccountability part of it though it's\nlike if i'm paying someone to tell me\nwhat to do i'm probably more likely to\nlisten than my friend telling me hey you\nshould work on this instead of doing the\nexact same thing every day but\nso i do work with a coach i think i'm\nthe only one in this group and for me\nit's accountability but not so much of\ndoing it it's like not doing stupid\nthings and some i have a especially\nthrough you know running in in college\nand stuff and afterwards i have a track\nrecord of doing horrendously stupid\nthings and burning myself out in a\nthousand different ways and sometimes\nit's nice to have someone tell you that\nyou're an idiot and don't do that\nso you have a problem with the moore's\nbetter philosophy of athleticism you're\nlike just always faster always better is\nthat a challenge for you\nabsolutely yeah\nso what do you agree with\nover over training i have an issue with\nthat's why i stopped running because i\nkept hurting myself it's harder to hurt\nyourself with over training on the bike\nat least like stress fractures and\npulled muscles and stuff\nyeah absolutely\num all right so maybe let's talk a\nlittle bit about planning then for the\nyear um what uh when do you start\nplanning your your season like how how\ndo you plan things out are you like ah\ntake it month by month or do you start\nway back in december and plan out your\nwhole season through september october\nwe probably don't have time for\neverybody but i'm curious what what some\nof the different philosophies are there\ngo for it\nfirst well again like i said earlier i\njust started getting into racing but i\nthink ideally it's probably looking at\nsmaller races month by month and\nto see how far they are far away then\naway they are work on my wife's schedule\nbigger events where there's you know\nthey're going to fill up you'd probably\nwant to start looking earlier to make\nsure you can get signed up and not get\nput on a waitlist\nthat's my experience so far i guess but\nagain i'm pretty green in this\nwho who's like i'm looking for someone\nwho's like oh no i planned this out in\ni planned like months and months in\nadvance who anybody on that end\ni'll start usually in\nlike november december kind of looking\nat maybe one or two races that i really\nwant to do well at next year\nand then kind of count back the weeks or\nthe months back from that and kind of\nstart a periodized training plan\num just a real general i don't lay out\nworkouts until probably maybe a couple\nof weeks ahead of time but\nwhat kind of layout here's kind of my\nbase phase and here's where i'll start\nworking on threshold and that kind of\nstuff but yeah i'll start november\ndecember\ndoes\nthank you thanks does anybody just\nwing it completely they're like i don't\nplan until like oh that one looks good\nand then you know they they go and sign\nup a couple weeks in advance and that's\njust how every race is\nno no no one wings it that much\ni mean i will i will sign up for\nsomething a week out um but i don't like\ni don't know i do just yeah\nbecause i get friends who'll be like hey\nyou should do this race and i'm like\nokay i'll go do that race\nyeah and i also think that um i'm a big\nbeliever that consistency is like really\nsuper important so in general i have\nthat base so i can go do that 100k or\n100 mile race\num i'm guessing that we've all kind of\ngot that base and so yeah a week before\nhey it looks like it's great weather at\nsilver city chris i was signing up the\nmore that morning up which i'm so glad\nyou did\nyeah yeah\num you know so it it it is a little bit\nof like because i've got the base\nbecause i've done the training because\ni've got the miles\ni feel really good just jumping into\nthose races right now um\ni i think if i was\nbut i i also know that i have started\nwith the plan of these are the three or\nfour races that i'm doing and they just\nare adding to my\nto my build\nall right all right\nwell i i could we probably\ni'm gonna learn a lot about doing these\ni probably could spend\na whole hour-long conversation about\nevery one of them so i'm going to move\non a little bit onto\nnutrition on the bike\num there were some questions and one by\nlisa morman who actually ended up on the\npodium at walk on\nshe's she was looking at like hey\nshe's got some gi distress issues very\nsensitive stomach and so curious if\nthere's anybody else with like sensitive\nstomachs and any tips on what to do with\nfood and hydration or\nany any sensitive stomachs in the group\ni don't i don't know that i say i have a\nsensitive stomach other than\nsometimes i just don't feel like eating\ncertain things on the bike\nlike even gels or\nlike chews i just sometimes they just\ndon't taste good to me so what i found\nworks best for me is just\nsome sort of uh hydration mix so\nthis year i'm trying flow formula\nso it's like\ni forget 350 calories per bottle or\nsomething like that\nand then last year i use the scratch\nsuper fuel that's similar i think that's\nlike 400 calories per bottle and that's\nliterally all i'll have for\na race if it's\nunder six seven hours that's all i have\nis hydration mix and that seems to i\ndon't have any gi issues from that\nif it gets over six seven hours then i\nmaybe have like some sort of a bar some\nsort of real food just to mix it up\nbut otherwise it's just straight\nhydration mix\ngotcha\num what what's other people's mix what\ndo they do to make sure their their\nstomach stays nice\nto them\ni'm similar as far as i do mostly liquid\nnutrition\ni kind of settle on making my own i just\nget bulk maltodextrin bulk fructose\nand i use like\nhydration tablets from science and sport\nor hammer or something like that so i'll\njust kind of mix up a ratio that i think\nhas been working for me i've kind of\ndialed it in over the last few years\nusually what i've settled on now is 50\ngrams of dextra or maltodextrin in a\nbottle and 25 grams of fructose and then\nadd an electrolyte tablet to it for the\nflavor and the the electrolytes and all\nthat kind of stuff and try to do a\nbottle an hour of that that's\nabout 300 calories then i'll have a\ni like sis gels so i use those maybe one\nor two an hour\nthat works for\neverything but hot races i found if it's\nhot i need more water\num and i haven't quite nailed that one\ndown that's where the gi is distressed\nwill usually come in for me is i don't\nhave enough water\nto replace what i'm sweating out and\nthen you have too much sugar in the\nsystem and not enough water and then\nyour gut just\ndoes not like that\nthat's my theory anyway yeah i\ndefinitely felt that at\ndown in arkansas this last week and i i\nwas eating and i was sweating i had\nplenty of moist you know i i wasn't\nbonking but i did my stomach did was not\nhappy with me\nuh anybody else so\nsounds like a lot of hydration uh\nuh you know getting the calories through\nyour bottle and everything anybody like\nnot prefer that preferred it's like\nplease i want to choose something i want\nsomething else but let's go with you\nyeah yeah i have to choose stuff i think\nmaybe it's from like the running days\nwhere you have to rely on that so much\nmore but like\ni mean\nmy bottles usually don't have any\ncalories it'll be water and then maybe\nnoon with electrolytes and then um just\nyou know eating clif bars dates like\nginger snap crackers fruit snacks just\nwhatever i can throw in my dirty pockets\nbasically gotcha jonathan what's what's\nyour what's your setup right now when it\ncomes to\nto fueling\nuh i eat and drink as much as i possibly\ncan\nwhat kind of what kind of food are\nwhat's your go-to's right now\nwell on the bike cliff bars\nreally like what you got a favorite\nflavor cliff bars and gatorade\nuh white chocolate macadamia i think oh\nyeah that is my grocery store and so\nwhen i'm on my way and i for i can just\nbuy it on my way to the event\nnice nice\nchris i have a couple things um my\nbackground is actually in food so i\nthink something really important for\nlisa is to really read labels and\nunderstand what she's seen when she does\nread those\num there's a lot of different ways that\nyou can get your sugar i know travis you\ntalked about your maltodextrin your\ndextrose and there's fructose and\nthere's sucrose and there's a lot of\ndifferent\ndifferent types of sugars inulin can\nalso sometimes fall in that camp and\nthey're all going to affect your gi\nsystem differently and they're going to\naffect you differently on a short race\nor versus a long rice versus heat versus\nnot heat and so for her for lisa unders\ntrying some different things and\nunderstanding what works and knowing why\nand what those differences are\nwould be my really first kind of step in\nall of that\num because you do have to get your\ncalories in you've got to get your\nhydration in\nand then you can get into some of the\nmore specifics like\nwhat exactly electrolytes do i need what\nexactly other macros might i need but\num learn to read your labels and kind of\nknow what you're putting in and you're\ngoing to figure out i think what works\nand what doesn't work yeah i i think so\nmuch of being an athlete is learning to\nbe a scientist almost so for you for\nyour science personally for your body\nand so say on a hot day on a\nyou know a century\na standard century or 100 mile you know\na longer-ish race what are you thinking\nabout what kind of sugars and things our\nmixer are you thinking of carry-on for\nyou\nyeah so i typically stick more with a\nsucrose on a long hot day\num but i hit a day a month ago where it\ntasted terrible and all i could really\nget into me was like a fizz or a noon\ntype thing so i ate mid-race had to\nreally reevaluate my calories because i\ni eat and drink much like jonathan as\nmuch as i can\num throughout the entire race so you\nkind of need to be ready and to be\nadaptable also\nall right it is definitely something i\nthink it's tricky for everybody and it\nseems to change as you get a little bit\nolder as well and so it's it's it's\nadjusting those let's hit on um\ngear real quick and maybe a quick thing\non recovery and then we'll we'll jump\ninto that lightning round and so uh\nhopefully we can keep this close to time\nuh so there was a question uh\nsomeone oh shoot i forgot to put their\nname down i'll i'll see if i can put in\nthe show notes or whatever\nthey've signed up for sarah cooper's\niowa gravel classic how many of you have\ndone that one before are familiar with\nwinterset in that area carrie anne has\ni've not done it but i know the area\nokay it looks so yeah\nyeah i don't know how much i don't know\nhow big this person is but he he had a\nquestion about like he's got maxis\nramblers size 40s on there and he's\nwondering if that's a good choice for an\niowa gravel classic\ni don't know how that's pretty specific\ni've i've ridden that\ntire um it it's fine it doesn't roll out\nas quickly as say\nvictoria tereno zero which is what i\nalways ride\nbut it's a good enough tire nothing\nwrong with it except maybe it's a little\nbit too aggressive of a tread pattern i\nfeel like in gravel\ntraction has more to do with volume and\nair pressure less to do with tread\ni think especially in iowa where it\ntends to be a finer grain like we we\ndon't get the bigger chunky stuff i\nthink that's true any other opinions on\non the maxis or how what size tire you\nprefer to be on for for iowa gravel\ni've i've also used the maxis rambler\nsame 40 millimeter size it's like\njonathan said it's a great tire but yeah\nit might be a little overkill i'm used\nto the well all i've done in iowa really\nis the walk-on\nuh gravel and if it's anything like that\nyeah i would definitely probably be\noverkill i think for that type of gravel\nyeah i think that area you you it's\nsimilar i think walk-ons a little bit\nfiner stuff or or or more refined like\nthat they're not complicated roads um\nthe class b roads it does get a little\nbit of you know sandy uh out there so\ni don't know derek did you have a\nthought you wanted to throw in there oh\ni was just gonna say yeah from the walk\non 100 yeah a lot of the roads are like\nthat but you do find throughout iowa\nsome spots because i've run a lot like i\nsaid i live in iowa city but i've ridden\nall over in iowa and sometimes you do\nfind some of that chunkier gravel\nbut i'm not an expert on gear i just\nrode what my like i said i just got my\ngravel bike last fall i've been riding\nthe uh um\nspecialized uh whatever they're called i\ncan't remember\nbut 42\nwhich ones\npathfinders yeah the past five years 42s\nand they've served me well so far\nyeah they got that center bead down the\nmiddle that\ncan be fast on some stuff and other\nstuff i've felt like i was slipping out\non on them a little bit\nall right so\ncurious is there any go-to\nuh kit or gear that you make sure that\nyou have on every race um\nyou know kind of that that stuff that's\nin your saddle bag maybe maybe does\neverybody ride with a saddle bag and\nlike a tool kit or do you just like yolo\nit and\nif if you don't make it you just make\nsure to call someone\ni always bring a plug or a couple plug\nsome sort of plug kit that's a lifesaver\nbecause you don't want to be putting in\ntubes if you're in a race because you've\njust lost\nspecifically dyna plug\nexactly a number of other plugs that do\nnot work the little the little pill\nthings\ndo not work yeah dynamic plug\nyeah i someone's i think dyna plug is\nwhat they used and that totally saved my\nlife here on this last race um i think\nis that is that the one where you you\nconnect the co2 cartridge to\nthe the spike so you just jam it in\nthere and you open up the co2 cartridge\nand and then when you pull it out it\nleaves the plug in or is that different\nthere's no the one i have the dyno plug\ni have is no co2 it's just like it's\nsimilar to what you'd plug a car tire\nwith but it's way smaller\nand it just it's just like a sticky\nblack and\nit looks like if you looked at it you'd\nsay there's no way this is going to plug\na tire but i've used them four or five\ntimes and they work every single time\nthey're amazing\nthe\nthe one that someone someone saved my\nlife with it was a dyna plug it's the\ndynaplug air and it it's so it's all\ndone by dyna plug the same dynaplug sort\nof uh setup but you put your co2\ncartridge on it directly\nand what i thought was genius about this\nis that you throw it into you you find\nyour hole you throw it right in\nand then you fill the tube up right\nthere and then when you pull it out it's\nplugged and done\nand i think that's my next purchase\nbecause it was i have a co2 cartridge\nand i have a plug system but this looked\nvery neat and actually would probably\nsave me a little weight and headache so\ni don't\ni'm not i i don't dyna plug is not a\nsponsor of the iowa gravel series but i\nmight need to reach out to them because\ni'm kind of sold they saved my life on\nthis last race\nuh all right and\nall right let's let's move on to\nrecovery here a little bit so this is\nwhere i want to get into jonathan's\nstory and also anybody else that's had\nto kind of like bounce back from like a\nmajor injury so i'd love a couple\nstories here\njonathan you had an experience in at\nunbound tell us a little bit about that\nand you can\nuh i haven't yet marked these things\nexplicit but you know\nyou can use whatever language you feel\nnecessary no i'm far enough away i don't\neven think i used profanity when it\nhappened but uh five miles into unbound\njust\nwriters being erratic and someone\nslammed on their brakes\ncausing someone else to swerve into my\nfront tire and i went down at a pretty\nfast clip i broke my calcaneus that's\nthe heel bone in two different places\nand so i'm\nhalfway through my convalescence before\ni can put weight on that\nprobably won't get to race until next\nyear again if i want to\nif i want to heal right and race right\nwow so what what are you doing i mean\nthat that's really that there's a lot of\ndifferent types of injuries and and\neverything but a foot injury can be\nspecifically tricky for like training\nkeeping your fitness up so what\nwhat are you doing what what are kind of\nyour thoughts as you as you go through\nthis process\nthere's not much i can do to to keep my\nfitness besides watch my diet and make\nsure i don't gain weight\ni'm working closely with a physical\ntherapist his name is mike bartels he's\na cyclist and an absolute genius when it\nwhen it comes to body mechanics and how\nto apply those to cycling yeah you can\nwork with him to minimize the problems\nthat i have as i come back\nyeah mike bartel edge physical fitness\nhe's over in omaha bellevue area\npapillion edge physical therapy yeah\nyeah he he's great i've worked with him\nas well um\nwhat\nwell i'll throw it out to the group as\nanybody else had to bounce back from a\nmajor injury what what kind of was the\nsituation there what did you do\nwell i i wasn't racing competitively but\ni did have to sort of bounce back from\nas the last marathon i ran i ran the\nlast like five miles i tore my groin\nmuscle\ni ran through the tear it was dumb so i\njust made everything worse\num but the way that yeah i mean i came\nback\num thankfully with that you could as\nlong as you don't do you know like\nneuromuscular like hard type efforts\nit's okay to ride the bike so i just was\nindoor training um for a while after\nthat\nwithout you couldn't do any pull motion\nso it's like i wrote without clips i\njust wrote on flats\njust basically figuring out what kind of\nexercise you know what you can do to try\nto maintain\nany fitness without furthering your\ninjury and obviously with the foot\ninjury it's going to be even worse i\nwould\nsay um with my running background i have\nhad a number of big injuries i mean\nthat's half the reason i'm in biking now\nincluding having surgery about 10 years\nago and with that you know it was a\ncouple weeks in a cast on crutches for\nlike eight weeks and you know with\nsomething like that you know you're\ngonna start at zero so in some ways it's\nlike figuring out how to build that\nbetter and not necessarily saving what\nyou had\nyeah with this group it makes it sound\nlike the best way to become a good\ngravel cyclist is to be an injured\nrunner\nlet's talk maybe and if anybody else has\na story in here that can kind of relate\nto this like what about that mental part\nof it like there's yes there's healing\nthe body but what about kind of the\nmental\nkeeping your head in the game when\nyou're feeling kind of broken what\nanything anything there\nyou maybe add on or talk about\nso for me i'm very grateful it wasn't a\nmore serious injury it\nit very easily could have been a\nlife-altering injury not just a six-week\nthing so\nvery grateful for that but it had that\neven even though it wasn't serious it's\ngiven me a much different perspective\nbecause you know i have\nfour kids and a wife and a career and\nthis has made me realize that i really\nneed to spend more time on my bike\n[Laughter]\nit's really it's really the gratitude\nand understanding you know what's\nimportant in life that i think is what\njonathan's point pointing out there and\ni i appreciate that\nlet's be i was going to say speaking of\nthe kids those it's really important i\nthink to have the support of your family\nlike i'm sure that they are very\nbefore your injury they want me out on\nmy bike more than i want me out on my\nbike\nyeah that's that's every yes every\nvacation we go on i have to bring my\nbike because they know i'm gonna be much\nbetter to be around if i get a ride in\nyeah some people get angry and we get we\nget bikery\nuh all right well i i don't i don't want\nto take us over too much on time i've\ngot a little bit of a lightning round\nhere\nand so\nwe'll do i've got a bunch of questions\nwe can do kind of like just raise the\nhands this is kind of like have you ever\nsort of thing so if you answer yes kind\nof raise your hand and then at the end\ni have a a a finish this sentence\nuh sort of questions i got four finish\nthis sentence so\nand then we'll we'll kind of wrap this\nup so thank you so much for for being\nthere this is this is great um all right\nlightning round question first one\nhave you ever puked on a ride\ngot a couple all right uh have you uh\nhave you ever skipped work to get in a\ntraining ride\na couple okay\nuh have you ever entered a race without\ntraining for it like going in zero\ntraining\nclaire i mean train specifically for it\nor just not training at all just no\nnothing just going nothing\ni don't know i'm always writing so i\nguess i can't say yes yeah\nokay fair enough um have you ever\nentered a race without training for it\nand won so this would be maybe yeah\nyou're just you just went off of your\nbase sort of thing but you weren't\ntraining specifically for it\nagain i i don't really train\nspecifically for anything i haven't had\na big enough event yet so gotcha all\nright um have you ever turned back on a\nride because you forgot your gps or your\nhead unit you're like i can't go out\nthere\ncarry ann's like yes\ni never forget it\nbut i would turn around\nyeah all right um have you have you ever\ngiven someone your tube pump co2\ncartridge on a race\nphil gary carrian\nclaire jonathan did i see a hand you\nmight have to put the hands up high okay\ni can't remember\nit sounds like it doesn't sound like me\nbut somehow i remember doing it\num have you ever had someone give you a\ntube or pump or co2 on a race\ndefinitely i got a jacket from an aid\nstation volunteer when i um got very\nnear hypothermia this year\noh\nnot exactly the question that definitely\nsaved me\nyeah i like the volunteers\nyeah i\nlike aid station angels and things like\nthat i very much i am so grateful for i\nhad a tube stuck in you know wrapped up\nunderneath my saddlebag and everything i\nthought it was fine\narkansas was too bumpy it bumped out and\ni ended up having to bum\na tube off someone so i'm grateful for\nthose um have you ever drafted someone\nfor 75 or more of a race and then beat\nthem at the end\nno hands up\nclass acts um\num but have you ever had to stay on\nsomeone's wheel to survive a ride or\nanything\nall of all of you that's that's awesome\num all right let's do finish uh finish\nthis sentence um maybe just just a\ncouple i can jump in if you feel like\nyou've got a good answer\num so the first one is\nuh you know fill in the blank i'm so\nglad my mom doesn't know i blank when i\nrace\ndo 45 miles an hour down a gravel\ndescent\nthis is just one word sorry\nthat's fine\nthat's a good one yeah yeah\nokay next one\nbike packing is blank\ni technically didn't i don't know i'm\ntechnically bike packed across iowa\nmyself so i don't know\nso claire you said dumb\nyeah i see the the appeal i haven't done\nit um i did do a big portion of a pretty\nfamous bike packing route in minnesota\non the north shore this past week but i\njust did about 100-ish miles of it and\njust banged it out in a day\nand i didn't i only had to carry half as\nmuch stuff it was great\nyou like carry less stuff right faster\nyou know that's the answer\nseems like a lot of planning\nall right\nnext one uh uci starting a gravel series\nis blank\nirrelevant\nirrelevant it's a good question good\nanswer\nall right all right good uh what was the\nuh phil did you say something else i saw\ni heard it relevant mine was less\npolitically correct\nlet's go with jonathan's\nall right and this one everybody can\njump in if you like um i wish i'd\nlearned blank\nsooner that i don't have to hammer it uh\nthe whole ride\nthat's how i started out racing and then\ni realized oh i can work with people so\nwhat else uh you wish you learned sooner\nhow to deadlift you wish you started\ndead lifting sooner yeah okay i i guess\ni i need to try this i need to try this\ndo more carry\non\ni'm gonna defer to claire while i keep\nthinking okay claire what's ready\nyeah for me i would say like how to have\nconfidence in my abilities and my bike\nhandling and fitness and everything\nyeah that's great\nall right well folks i tried really hard\nto keep this kind of close to an hour\nyou have been fantastic i'm going to go\nahead and wrap this up stay on just for\na moment and and uh we'll uh we'll wrap\nup but\nthank you i want to put it thanks for\nputting on the series thanks for

Location is absolutely a factor in developing our love, appreciation, and talents when it comes to fitness. Just ask anyone living in Colorado... they'll remind you of the altitude benefits.\n\nCharles Erickson grew up in Omaha, but had family in Silver City, so he knows these roads and when it came time to sign up for the Silver City Century, it was personal. He didn't want to just do well, his goal was the podium. In this episode of the podcast we get to learn a bit about how Charles balances competition and being a good guy; come to find out they both use a core skill. We also dip into nutrition and lessons learned from racing over the last decade.",

          "transcript": "well everyone welcome to another episode\nof the Iowa gravel series Podium podcast\nI'm your host Chris McQueen and like so\noften we have an amazing guest uh with\nus today Charles Erikson Charles was\nrecently on the podium at our 2024\nSilver City Sentry on the 100K of course\nand we are are so excited to have him to\nlearn a little bit about him and the\ncycling team that he's on which is\nViking cycling because there was not\njust him but another uh teammate on the\nuh on the podium that day uh Brady\nHopwood and so we'll talk a little bit\nabout that but uh Charles it is so good\nto have you on the podcast I'm happy to\nbe here thank\nyou so Charles um we we need to we need\nto start off with getting to know you a\nlittle bit so can you tell us a little\nbit about where you are where you grew\nup and then of course we need to hear\nyour origin story for like how you got\ninto cycling yeah um I'm from Omaha\nNebraska born and raised uh essentially\nthe same neighborhood my whole life\nmoved around here and there and here and\nthere but um kind of the same\nneighborhood right in the right in the\nheart of Omaha um I have a wife and a\nyoung I guess middle middle Young aged\ndaughter uh was almost 14 years old and\num we met in high school and things got\nstarted early for us and just kind of\nbeen riding the the roller coaster that\nis life as a as a young family um and\nsettled down in the house a few years\nago and have enjoyed kind of planting\nOur Roots so to speak there um I got\ninto the bike from my uncle who actually\nlived in Silver City uh for a short\nperiod of time they renovated a house\nthat's part of the National Historical\nregistry was the old mayor's house top\nof the hill and it had sat abandoned for\n40 years and they as a kind of a\nretirement gift to themselves my aunt\nand uncle along with their son and some\nlocal help renovated this whole house\nand lived there for five or six years so\nmy first my first ride short of you know\nthe uh toodling along on the on the path\nor you know going to the gas station to\nget handy bars in the summer with my\nfriends was on the Wabash with my uncle\nprepping for ragb um so being in Silver\nCity that was kind of um a nice uh like\nmental full circle uh you know way to be\non the bike so that's how it started and\nI found that I had a little bit of an\naptitude for it so the the competitive\nnature just kind of took off from there\nthat's so cool I didn't realize that you\nhad family in Silver City or that that\nwas a place that you'd you know kind of\ngrown up a little bit obviously not not\nlived there but had family there and\nthings um so the when rough around about\nwhat time do you remember kind of your\nfirst memory in Silver City like what\ntime frame are we we talking here uh\n200 2005 2006 okay somewhere in there so\n18 20 years yeah 20 years a little while\nago has Silver City changed much in the\nlast 20 years no\nuh I can't remember is it the hood is it\nstill called the hood or was that the\nprevious place that was the previous\nPlace Kevin own the hood I forget\nKevin's last name but he was fantastic\nhe it was definitely one of the places\nwhere we had like our our post-race meal\num that first year of the Silver City\nCentury um but now it's been taken over\nby a wonderful uh woman uh Andrea uh at\nSilver spokes is how they've rebranded\nit okay rebuilt that so yeah silver\nspokes now but no hasn't change much and\nfunny enough I was I was talking to one\nof my one of my buddies after the race\nand was kind of telling the story that I\njust told there about them purchasing\nthe house and you know and the I'm\nassuming the owner of the bike shop\npopped her head out and she was like he\nmust be talking about alets and you know\nmy heart I'm a very uh I'm a very\nsentimental person um sometimes uh you\nknow I just got this like really warm\nheart feeling and I was like yes I\nabsolutely absolutely I absolutely am\ntalking about alets and she she\nremembered him and he's got he's got a\nbench on the on the wob bash um just I\nguess it would be west of Silver City um\nbut yeah yeah so that's you know Silver\nCity apparently hasn't changed that much\nwhere almost 20 years later the the\nowner of the bike shop knows who who I\nwas talking about just by just by a few\nsentences so that's so cool yeah Mary\nJoe is fantastic happy trail Cyclery um\nif you ever uh if you like to follow\nthings on social she posts every morning\nthe weather and trail conditions uh for\nthe W bash around that area yeah so if\nyou're ever wondering like how the trail\nis um on the W bash at least up to to\nSilver City and everything uh check out\nHappy Trails uh Cy 3 on um on Facebook\nand you'll you'll get the latest info\nthat's good to know I wrote it this\nweekend and the trails were not great so\nshould have I should have heed her her\nadvice yeah yeah well cool that is so\ncool we might have to come back to that\nbecause uh you did mention training for\nragb do you how old were you when you\nfirst did ragb um this must have been I\nthink I was just out of high school so\n19 or 20 years old and I'm 31 now so\nthis is 11 12 years ago and I just did\nthe first day but I mean this is like\nyou know sneakers shorts uh t-shirts\num eating pasta the the mning of\nthinking that's what car looing is uh\njust like the episode of The Office\nwhere they run the marathon like not you\nknow very very introductory cycling um\nbut yeah yeah I rode the first day of\nbrag by it left from Council Bluffs that\nyear so I I suppose we could backtrack\nto what year that would have been but\nyeah left from Council Bluffs did it\nwith him and I mean it was probably 40\nor 50 miles but when you've only ever\nridden down the BL to a friend's house\nit was uh it was you know a a jump for\nsure yeah so you weren't you weren't\nracing bikes in high school when was the\nfirst time you like got on a bike to be\nlike all right I'm going to actually do\nsome sort of like more organized race\nthing um I bet we're looking at like\n2016 maybe 2016 2017 somewhere in that\ntime period uh and I can't\nremember well I guess I take that back\nso he he passed away in I think\n2015 uh and I took ownership of he had a\nMerlin titanium bike that was like three\nsizes too small for me uh but it had\ncampy super record it campy Wheels\ntitanium bike I thought it was the\ncoolest thing in the world and it was\nlike you can't I mean I I would kind of\nagree with you that's a that's a pretty\ncool setup and also like the lineage of\nit you know it was it was his bike so I\nI felt very honored to have it um and\nit's like well if you have this if you\nhave this bike Ling around you have to\nuse it so I think I just started riding\nit from there um and then it just\ndeveloped but of course it was like\nthree sizes too small for me so maxed\nout it was still uh very uncomfortable\nto ride so got a bike that fit me uh and\nthen you know straa you you want to\nchase the chase the crowns so my brother\nand I would just Chase as many k\nsegments as we could which is\ncompetitive in and of itself and then uh\nthe local Tuesday night crit series that\nJonathan weight uh who I know you've had\non the podcast who is uh kind of a a\nlocal cycling Legend and I don't want to\ninflate his ego too much but I know if\nhe hears that he'll he'll his heart will\nwarm a little bit he'll just kindly say\nyes yes I am but he is um but he put on\nhe put on this series uh and yeah that\nwas my first like competitive event uh\nwas just a Tuesday night crit around a\nparking lot of the school and that it\nkind of snowballed from there yeah no\nthat sounds like a good snowball I mean\nwhat what happened for Strava or or\nTuesday night crits straa yeah how'd you\nget introduced to that uh I can't even\nremember to be honest um so I I for a\nvery short period of time built bikes\nfor Green Street Cycles um lived next\ndoor to the owner uh and that's kind of\nhow that started so you know the I think\nbikes were always like adjacent to my\nlife but up until like that 2016 2017\ntime period it wasn't like a a Mainstay\nlike it is now um and then my brother\ngot a job there and you know you start\nto then run in the same community and\nit's just like cookies on the internet\nyou look up one thing and then you start\nseeing more and more of that and um so\nthat's that's kind of\nhow the the frequency at which bikes and\nthat culture exists in uh exists in our\nlife started to become more prevalent\nand yeah then it was um you know chasing\nkm on straa and then meeting up with\nfriends for a ride and then scratching\nthat competitive itch and yeah yeah the\num so Green Street were you working uh\nlike in the storefront or were you\nwrenching I was in the basement so\nstrictly strictly building bikes and\nwhen I started I wanted it to be this\nglamorous like building be super\nhigh-end but I wasn't cut out for that\nuh I was building I was building hybrids\nand you know the the bikes that get most\npeople on the road and and interested in\nbikes kids bikes and other hybrids so I\nwas in the basement hidden away um and I\ndid that for probably a few months um\nbut made some good good relationships\nwith with folks there and uh you know it\nended up turning into my brother getting\na job there uh and he actually did much\nmore consumer facing stuff and service\nmanagement that sort of thing um what's\nyour brother's name Seth Seth is he\nolder than you he's four years younger\nthan me looks just like me but blonde\nhair oh nice I don't know if I don't\nknow if I've met Seth yet I'll have to\nkeep my my out for him so do you do you\nstill do you and Seth are do you have\nlike a training group or do you do you\nand Seth still ride like what's what's\nkind of unfortunately no that's that's\none of the things that um you know my\nlife's mission is trying to get him back\non a bike he had some some knee issues\nthat took him off the bike for a good\nperiod of time that he's had a hard time\nrehabilitating um so we've we've gone\nout a couple times but it's uh it's just\na matter of finding the right\ncombination of of Witchcraft to get his\nhis knee back in shape but um yeah he\nwas my first my first writing partner I\nhope that he's my last writing partner\num someone I care about a whole heck of\na lot and enjoy enjoy being able to\nspend that time with but you know now is\nthere's seasons of life and right now\nit's just one of those Seasons where we\naren't writing together so yeah oh yeah\nand I mean injury I think that is\nactually kind of always an interesting\narea that uh that we can look at in\nterms of like the setbacks that can\nhappen with injury I mean if you have\nyou faced any injuries in your career\nhere as you've uh gone through uh yeah\nyou know going from I mean I I guess I\njust I I I'm honestly assuming because\nif I hear anybody that starts off with\ncrits I'm assuming that there was an\ninjury somewhere along the way maybe\nthat's an assumption I had a I had a\nfairly good injury in 2018 I went over\nthe bars at 42 miles an hour and broke\nmy neck uh yeah fractured my my C1\nvertebrae it was a a very small fracture\nbut in you know I'm no medical expert\nI'll I'll put that on the table right\nnow but from everyone that I've talked\nto it's just about as bad of a position\nas it could be um yeah so I spent 13\nweeks in a neck brace my wife and I got\nmarried while I was wearing a neck brace\num so that was uh you know I've had I've\nhad Falls here and there where you get\nsome aches and pains and lost a little\nbit of skin but nothing nothing bad but\nthat's that's one that um you know\nprobably tops the list what was that wow\nI mean that's amazing I I mean C1 for\nanybody who's just listening to this and\nthat doesn't understand or doesn't have\ntoo much familiarity with vertebrae C1\nis basically the the the bottom kind of\nof your neck it goes like see c t and\nthen lumbar so CTL I believe um the rest\nyeah and then C1 I think is the highest\nlike essentially the brain stem yeah you\ncould I mean if you had broken that\nseverely you would have been you know\nquadr quadr much like Christopher Reeves\nin terms of like needing a ventilator to\nkeep breathing sort of thing so that\ncould be a very serious injury yeah and\nit was it was pretty humbling you know\nit was on a ride um and you know family\ngets called in everyone's of course\nanytime someone goes to the emergency\nroom but I was I was up I was chipper\nfor the most part I think and then um\nyou know they took some X-rays they\nrushed in and were like hey you you need\nto lay down like we need to talk to your\nfamily outside and you're just like oh\nthis can't this can't be good and then\nthat night I was feeling real real down\nlike you know you you feel tough riding\nthe bike and then to be you know barely\neven able to to use the restroom on your\nown um that's pretty humbling and I was\nwalking around in the hospital and kind\nof you know did this number to turn a\nrobot yeah yeah uh and saw someone in a\nbed like fully rigged up wearing a Halo\nso they had the you know the the the\nbrace the supportive piece and you know\nthat that like one millimeter more of\nrotation when I did that number and that\ncould have been me so that seeing that\nlike in a very vulnerable moment like\nthat was\num you know it made me realize that like\nyeah this isn't bad or this is bad but\nthis isn't there there are people\ndealing with far worse\ncircumstances uh than myself right now\nwell it sounds like there's definitely\nkind of maybe some themes here that\nwe're picking up on your life because\nfor those that are on the the audio\npodcast you're you're the Hat you're\nwearing says always grateful yeah and uh\nit um and and and the story I think I'm\nkind of interested to hear a little bit\nmore about you know getting married with\nwith and that injury and then eventually\ngetting back on the bike and everything\num what what do you I mean what what do\nyou feel is like fueled you to um I some\npeople could get down after something\nlike this some people could also be you\nknow they they choose maybe they don't\nsee the Gratitude and they see only the\nGap and things so like Curious just you\nknow your personal philosophy like what\nwhat has prepared you to to be in this\nkind of grateful place or this place\nwhere you acknowledge that wow you know\nthings have turned out better than I\nthought and and how has that fueled you\nin your in your Athletics and your in\nyour training and and in your life yeah\nI think circumstances kind of forced a\nlot of it um you know my my wife who was\nnot my wife at the time ju just before\nbecame a full-time caretaker for you\nknow at least two weeks um you know it\nwas everything from needing help getting\nout of bed and not that I I felt that\nbad but trying to put as much time and\nattention into recovery uh in in the\nhealing process you know it's getting\nhelp out of bed it's getting help in the\nshower uh this is really embarrassing\nbut like using the restroom uh those\nsorts of things when you when you really\ncan't move the upper half of your body\nshort of just your arms like that are\nhard to do any sort of twisting motion\nis is off limits uh so seeing someone\nwho is just like thrust into that\nposition uh you have to you have to put\nforth a lot of care to to be a person\nthat can do that and she is um and my\nfamily you know we were getting married\nand so all all of my family's in town\nand you know seeing them helping as much\nas they can uh you know having friends\npick me up and take me to work cuz I\ncan't drive and take me home you know\nbeing willing to pick me up at 9:00 at\nnight and um things like that like the\namount of care and attention I got\nprimarily from My Wife and then family\nand then friends and then just the\ncommunity outside of that uh I think\nthat that kind of forces a lot of if it\nForce feeds you some gratitude um and uh\njust recognizing that you know I think\ngenerally speaking people are\ngood-willed they have good intentions\ngood\ntrying to trying to recognize that and\njust appreciate that Mo most of the time\nwe all just want what's best for us um\nsometimes it sometimes it impacts others\nin a negative way but I think at the end\nof the day that's that's what people\nwant it's just just to be happy just\nwhat's best for them um and and for her\nthat was supporting and caring for the\none she loved and I yeah hard not to be\ngrateful for that absolutely no what\nwhat a beautiful thing and and so\nwonderful that you have that family and\nthat support So this brings I think a\nlittle bit of the dichotomy of cycling\nand being competitive how do you who I\nthink as we listen to the story have\nmuch to be grateful for you seem like a\nreally nice guy and everything like that\num uh how do you resolve that with like\na a strong will and desire to be\ncompetitive and win in these places like\nhow do you how do you balance that in\nyour life I mean uh because there's a\nlot of folks that you yeah I'm I'm I\nI'll guess I'll just start there like\nhow what can you be a nice guy and can\nyou be competitive it's it it is tough\num I think I'm I'm competitive most with\nmyself and sometimes you know my my\nstandard is here and fortunately uh it\njust so happens that the competition is\nright here uh but the thing I struggle\nwith is if the competition is right here\nbut my internal standard is here finding\nthat 10% gap or 2% or what ever it is to\npush past what I know is capable of\nmyself to then reach that that next\nlevel so I know what I can do and I know\nuh a result in an effort that will make\nme happy whether that's first or\n58th um so a lot of the time it's just\nachieving that that personal Benchmark\num but then something that I truly have\nlike had to had to work at over the\nyears is telling myself like okay you\nyou deserve you deserve to be here here\nyou can beat these people you should\nbeat these people you shouldn't take\nthat poll because you need to beat them\num you don't need to prove that you're\nthe toughest you know sometimes beating\nothers is better than beating yourself\num so that's that's something that's\nbeen a struggle so I wish I knew the\nanswer to that but I'm still I'm still\nworking on that one what is there I mean\nwhere do you feel like you learned that\nlesson the most like was there a\nspecific race where you came away from\nit going gez I I should have done that\ndifferently and it kind of changed your\nphilosophy in that way um I would say\neveryone just a little bit uh something\nI've I've tried to to do a lot more as\nbeing like very conscious of what's\nwhat's happening in a race I think it's\neasy to you know at the start it's very\nintense and then once things settle and\nfizzle out a little bit you you kind of\nknow your place and then it's just\nmonotony for four hours and then you\nknow there's a little bit of racing at\nthe end but trying to be conscious of\nevery moment and you know especially in\na group taking taking smart polls um\nbeing aware of what others are doing and\nhow others are feeling and trying to\ninternalize that how can I utilize that\nuh against them potentially if it if it\ncomes down to it so I think kind of like\nturning on the race brain more than just\nthe uh I'm I'm out here riding my bike\nwith some buddies sort of side of the\nbrain um yeah that's that's been the\nbiggest thing it's just like trying\ntrying to be conscious of what's\nhappening during the race and and\nactually internalizing that not just\nletting it pass by but recognizing\nmoments where there's successes and\nfailures there yeah that's kind I've\nnever really thought of it that way in\nterms of like you could use essentially\nyour emotional intelligence your ability\nto have empathy for someone else and you\ncan both use it for good to be the nice\nguy but also kind of use that same\nmuscle and that power to say okay I\nthink I think this is where that person\nis I'm going I'm going to\nI'm going to react accordingly to win in\nthis competition sort of thing so I\nthink that's that's actually I think\nthat's really cool and something you can\nthink about because I do know um you\nknow there's there's parts of the world\nand I think there's even little parts of\ngravel where we struggle with the idea\nof like things being competitive we\ndon't want it to be necessarily\ncompetitive we want it to be like hey\nthis is a fun thing everybody can be\ninvolved and they can but at the same\ntime we also want it to be a race and\nand balancing that within within gravel\num can always be a little bit tricky\nespecially for me as a race director\nwhich kind of brings me to I want to I\nwant to ask about Silver City this year\nin the race because from what I\nunderstand uh it sounds like you were\nalone for a good chunk of that race how\ndo you remember uh a little bit of how\nthat uh that initial uh separation came\nabout and then what it was like uh you\nknow uh you know staying out in front\nuntil you you came across the line first\nyeah I uh I don't I don't love riding in\ngroups I I ride most of the time solo um\nwhich is something that I'm working on\nbecause Pack racing is important in a\nrace and those Dynamics but um so we\ncame up to the first Hill and like this\nis a this is a bigger group than I want\nit to be let's let's just turn the\nscrews a little bit and see what see\nwhat happens and so I did uh and then\nbeing a bigger writer I know that uh my\nability to go downhill uh is probably a\nlittle bit better than other or at least\nI can do it quicker than others and it's\nnot going to be as difficult for me to\ndo so so I did that went hard up the\nhill went hard down the hill looked back\nand had I don't know a 10 second depth\nperception is not my thing so it might\nhave been it might have been five\nminutes or 10 seconds I don't know um\nbut yeah had a 10-c gap or so and then\nfrom there um I tried to be like really\ncalculated about it I knew that we would\nhave a Tailwind for the better part of\nthe first half of the race uh and again\nwith flats and downhills and Hills that\nare not a huge grade someone who's of a\nlarger stature um relatively speaking\nlike myself could kind of use that to\ntheir advantage I knew the power I could\nhold for a half hour and the power I\ncould hold for three hours after that\njust from training and previous races\nand again like being cognizant of what's\nHappening remembering those remembering\nthose numbers remembering courses uh uh\nin course profiles and so yeah I just\nput in a hard effort for 30 minutes and\nreally tried to uh meter my efforts to\nwhere it would benefit me and and my\noverall speed the most and by the end of\nthat 30 minutes I I was out of sight or\nknow at least situationally I couldn't\nsee who was behind me so then it was\njust a matter of hunkering down and um\nletting the you know the the little\ndemons in the back of my head that were\nsaying every time I look back that tree\ntree branches someone chasing you um\nyeah so just kind of metered it out from\nthere but that's that's how it played\nout so uh so it sounds like and you kind\nof sounds like you went in with this\nstrategy and just you know given a for\nfolks who haven't been on the Silver\nCity course um before the first five\nmiles are pretty good siiz rollers it\njust they're just good-sized you know\nlus Hills style rollers you know a\nlittle bit more than what you might get\nin like de Mo or even certain areas of\nOmaha I think I mean I think they're\nthey're pretty substantial um Jonathan\nwe who you mentioned said at one point I\nthink uh on either yeah I think after\nhis first time winning Silver City\nbecause he's he's been on the podium a\ncouple times uh he said he's like this\nwas a big compliment for me because um\nyou know like you like I said you know\nJonathan's a little bit of a a legend\nhe's like this was the perfect course\nand then he qualified for me so\ncurious I'm curious uh do you feel like\nSilver City was a perfect course for\nyour abilities or you know do you feel\nlike there was potentially competition\nout there that could have given you a\nhard time on that course or do you feel\nlike this was really a course that that\nthat played to your strengths yeah it\ndef it definitely did um you know I\nthink I can excel in something that\ndoesn't have huge clim so another uh\nanother Iowa race that's in that same\narea the L Hills and duro uh that rafle\nputs on I I love that race um but every\nevery year I find myself as the you know\nthe the biggest of the guys at the top\nor the you know the smallest of the guys\ndown here if that makes sense kind of\nthis weird this weird middle ground but\nthere's a lot of really steep climbs\nthere that are are really challenging\nfor me um but yeah I I felt I felt\nreally at home on those roads uh it is\nit is a great course like not to not to\njust uh say that to say that for the\nsake of kind of lip service but it it\nwas a great course um and it yeah it\njust it suited me well nice rolling\nclimbs the wind was favorable that day\nit wasn't too hot it wasn't cold um yeah\nit was it was just right I think well\nI'm gonna I'm gonna try and tap into\nyour into the nice guy side of you and\nwe'll see how how much of you push back\non the competitive side but on the nice\nside side what what would you what what\nsuggestions and strategies would you\ngive to someone that's that's going into\nSilver City like what do you think are\nthe most important things to keep in\nmind with a with a course like that yeah\nhaving uh fortunately I was able to take\nthe mmrs at my own or the minimum\nmaintenance roads the B roads I know\nthey're called different things in\ndifferent parts of the of the region but\nfor me it's an MMR um being able to take\nthose at my own pace because there were\nthey weren't bad these rain ruts that\nyou get that can easily kind of swallow\nwheel that way and then you go that way\nuh I've seen it before it's happened to\nme um that that was huge so if you're\ngoing into these minimum maintenance\nroads even if it means you have to fall\noff the back I think getting 10 seconds\nbehind someone to take these at your own\npace and to be comfortable and and safe\non them to have confidence that's that's\nhuge that would be I think item number\none um and it's not like they're\nDangerous by any means but anything at\nat race Pace or if you're if you're\nfollowing someone's wheel closely like\nyou do in a uh whether it's a\nrecreational ride you're looking for\nthat for that draft to to save some\neffort but doing that in those sections\ncan be challenging so that that would be\nthat would be item number one yeah yeah\ndefinitely have to think about the\nsafety and I mean the the fun thing\nabout it's it's I come from a roadie\nbackground where like you know\nespecially on those group rides\neverybody's pointing out every little\npot hole and helping you dodge every\nlittle you know weird thing that you\nmight come across the road or or things\nlike that and I think one of the\nchallenges that as you get into gravel\nand I don't know maybe at the pointy end\npeople are a little bit nicer but I I\nhaven't noticed this it's like you got\nto keep your hands on the handlebars\nlike you can't you can't be pointing\nthings out for everyone even on a nice\ngroup ride per se you just have you have\nto have your eyes open and yeah and\nlooking at what's going on there's a\nmatter of self-preservation for sure I\nthink you know we as the writer has to\nhas to come first or I as the writer has\nto come first um and and yeah you can't\nyou can't always point that things those\nsorts of things out no one wants ill for\nanyone else but if if that is at the\nexpense of me I'm I'm picking me in that\nmoment I'm keeping my hands on the bars\nI'm staying focused I'm I'm watching\nwhat I need to to watch\nyeah but at the same time it's a team\nsport and I've actually been trying to\nencourage a lot of folks especially\nthose new who maybe aren't as worried or\nconcerned about being uh competitive in\nthat they they think they're going to be\non the pointy end of or you know the the\npodium sort of thing but they're being\nmaybe competitive for themselves they're\nwanting to do their best effort is\nencouraging people more and more to say\nlook go find a group work together as a\ngroup and you're going to go a lot\nfarther and do a lot better and have a\nfresher day and you're going to learn a\nlot so I'm curious you know you've got\nthe the Vikings cycling team Brady\nHopwood was there and I believe uh the\nfounder or primary sponsor for Viking\nwas was on the course as well tell me a\nlittle bit about Viking and tell me a\nlittle bit why you ditched your team\nyeah um well yeah so Viking like as a\nyou know the the pr statement would be\nwe're a company that paints refurbishes\nand services water towers um which I\nthink especially in the midwest here\nwater towers are a they're they're a\nLifeline for a lot of these small towns\nuh b as as a cyclist like when I'm when\nI'm riding 100 miles and you're out on a\ngravel road and it's 96\ndegrees that that's just like a Beacon\nof Hope it's I I know there's a town\nthere there's probably a Casey's uh so I\ncan get there I can get shade it's it's\na landmark situation you know um you\nknow where you're going you know what\nthe next the next one is so yeah it's\nit's I mean it's a great company and\nRory the uh co-owner owner president I\ndon't I don't know the technical term\nthere but uh he also really Geeks out on\ncompetitive bike racing and loves riding\nbikes so he kind of put together a team\nand has has put a lot of his time effort\nand attention into uh into being sure\nthat everyone that's riding with him has\nhas a great experience and um yeah so\nBrady and I\nRory and I were there and I didn't I\ndidn't know that that's what my plans\nwere going to be until it was in the\nmoment you know until I looked back and\nhad 30 seconds to think about it um but\nthey both did a great job you know the\nthe road racing tactics not pulling back\na teammate they didn't uh credit to them\nand then I think fortunately it worked\nout for them where they could they could\nstill have their own race you know after\n20 minutes of skipping a poll or taking\na poll they could they could have their\nown race and uh and still get just as\nmuch competitively as they would have\nhoped for um yeah yeah they were out\nthere they were out there doing the the\nteam thing so that was that was fun and\nuh much appreciated what uh tell me a\nlittle bit about like um what Viking\ndoes as a team because from what I\nunderstand this is kind of the first\nyear or maybe the second year it's\nfairly new team um what's like if\nsomeone wants to get involved if\nsomeone's like looking for a team you\nknow what kind of what kind of team is\nViking what kind of what kind of folks\nis what kind of teammates is Viking\nlooking for yeah uh it's definitely\ncompetitive first I think would be would\nbe an accurate assessment and you know\nthat doesn't mean that we have every\nsingle one of the fastest riders or that\nwe're trying to to poach you know all of\nthe the best Riders from any one local\nteam that we can but like racing bikes\nis is a core tenant of the team you know\nknow Rory Phil uh who's another uh\nanother one of the teammates and a\ncolleague of mine we all work together\nand you know it's after Unbound it's\nit's getting it's getting coffee and\ntalking about Unbound or after one of\nthe Tuesday night crits it's talking\nabout the Tuesday night crits you know\nwe we all enjoy racing bikes so I think\nsomeone who has a\ncompetitive competitive interest is\nprobably uh close it at heart to us um\nbut one of the things I appreciate about\nbikes is uh competition is not just a\nplacing um I went to Midsouth this year\nand and you know my my competition was\nuh a goal time and I think it's it's\nkind of like Iron Man very few people\nare going to win an Iron Man race but\neveryone can set a goal everyone can be\ncompetitive with that goal uh and I\nthink that's you know for a lot of\npeople that's that's where bike racing\nor the competitive nature of bikes is is\njust competition with oneself uh so yeah\nwe're we're all on board for that too oh\ncool yeah no I agree in fact that I\nthink that a question I always like to\nask people is what is kind of your goal\nright now what are the things that\nyou're working on and learning on\nbecause I feel like cycling is so in\nathletics in general tends to be kind of\na a scientific method you know you're\nthe experiment and we're working and\nalways trying to figure out okay how do\nI how do I maybe get to this next step\nin engineering my performance or or\nputting some sort of structure around\ngetting towards this goal that I have\nwhether it's time or a race or a bigger\neffort or whatever so so what's your\nwhat's your goal uh this year what have\nyou been focusing on well uh speaking\nkind of holistically as a club it's it's\nfeeling things out um you know putting\nputting on a club short of just like hey\nwe all bought the same jerseys from Rafa\nor Al or whatever and we're all going to\nride together you know a couple times a\nmonth um it's it's to navigate we'd like\nto put on an event or get ourselves\ninvolved with an event somehow um and I\nthink just being like I I want more than\nanything some random person to be like\noh I saw that guy in that Jersey and he\nwas super nice to me he asked me if I\nneeded if if I needed a CO2 because I\nwas sitting on the side of the road he\nsaw me uh you know throwing up on the\nside of the road during gravel worlds\nand he slowed down and asked if I needed\nwater like I I want us to be the the\nnicest people out on out on any you know\ngiven Trail group ride whatever it is so\nthat's the nicest group that will kick\nyour trash be really nice about it yeah\nthat's gonna that's gonna uh you know\nmake you pedal with your eyebrows to\ncatch up with them um so that's the\nthat's the holistic view of you know the\ngoal for the year I think speaking for\nmyself as kind of a member of the club\nuh but then me personally I think being\nbetter at racing a bike if that if that\nmakes sense you know I think um the uh\nthe performance and the physical side of\nit is one thing but you also have to be\ngood at racing a bike uh strategy uh\npack Dynamics equipment Choice making\nsmart decisions with with your equipment\nand taking care of that equipment uh\nnutrition hydration everything else that\ngoes into what it takes to um you know\nto come across the line in the best\nposition you can or in the best time\nthat you can that's that's been a big\nFocus this year for sure the training\nthe training is always there uh but a\nlot of it is trying to to dial in those\nother those other pieces yeah is there\none thing that you've learned recently\nor that you've been one thing\nspecifically that you've played with\nrecently that uh you feel like oh well\nthat worked or maybe it didn't work kind\nof you're yeah um I I have a I have a\ncoach who is uh I think he's very very\nsmart and that's one of the reasons I\nsought him out uh it wasn't an accident\nuh Zach Allison with Source endurance um\nwho is involved with a lot of crit races\ngravel races uh he's been in the scene\nfor a long time but he I think he's he's\nraced enough to know that uh mindset is\nsuper important so kind of managing\nmindset and like when I'm hurting in a\ngroup realizing that it's unlikely that\nI'm\nthe the weakest person there so probably\nother people are hurting too and other\npeople are probably hurting as much as I\nam so when you you know when you Crest\nthat hill and your three bike links off\nthe group of four people in front of you\nand it feels so easy to just accept that\nthat's well that's that's that group\nthat's that's my ride for the day I'll\nI'll phone it in from here um knowing\nthat like they're hurting too and and I\ncan catch up with them and we're all\ngoing to be in a very similar situation\nso I think managing\nmindset uh and recognizing that you know\nyou you deserve to be with the group\nyou're riding with you're you're there\nyou got there somehow uh you you have\nthe legs to to back it up whether that's\nup here and it's for the for the win or\nit's back here for this this time goal\nlike you're there for a reason stick to\nit you got it yeah that's a good\nreminder um yeah that's a very good\nreminder that uh uh again kind of going\nback to that like ability to just you\nknow use our empathy both for you know\nfor good and for the use of like where\nwe are and staying in the moment staying\npresent and not yeah and and I think\nthat's another good point about that you\nknow that gratitude is external facing\nyes you feel it internally but you you\nintrinsically start feeling gratitude\nand things like that because you\nacknowledge there's something Beyond you\nnobody's just I don't know may maybe\nexcept for uh uh who was was it there\nwas someone who uh oh it was Snoop Dogg\nat an award at one time said hey you\nknow he was up there accepting an award\nand he's like first person I'd like to\nthank is me I want to thank me for not\ngiving up I want to thank me for working\nhard yeah which actually is I think is\nokay as well that's also you know useful\nthing to do like you said to know you're\nyou're there for a reason so yeah that's\nthose are some good points I want to go\nback to something you mentioned about\nbeing involved in some other events and\nuh because we've had we've got in\nSeptember uh Prairie Bloom uh our\nthey're we're working with them on\nputting together the Glenwood Super\nBloom which is a women's only gravel\nrace and then pisga the soldier cut off\nhild dururo we've often had um Omaha\nVell come out and they've done uh some\nuh Aid stations for us at that race and\nand things like that we love having them\nso uh I would love to have a viking out\nto race Silver City if you've you know\ngot a a relationship there or any other\nother races and things that uh you're\ninterested in if that's something that\nyou want to talk about uh let me know\nand and I'm going to put that shout out\nto any other race organization or group\nthat's out there we we love the\nopportunity to work with folks that are\nalready you know passionate about\ncycling and want to make you know put on\ngood events and stuff so don't want to\nput you too much on the spot but if\nthere's something you're interested in\nlet me know yeah yeah we were talking\nabout that with the the superow bloom\nonce I realized that it was Bo's only\nevent it's like cool I can't ride i' I'd\nlove to love to volunteer and be there\nso yeah we we'd like that oh that'd be\nsweet yeah I would love to I would love\nto just have the course absolutely\nfilled with folks cheering and awesome\nAid stations and help along the way and\nso with Julie bore who's you know the\nthe race director for that so yeah let's\nwe'll figure that out um I'm trying to\nthink if there's anything else that we\nwanted to oh here here's one last thing\nI want to kind of hit on and you\nmentioned it about uh carb loading uh\nproperly and stuff what is something\nthat you've learned about you uh and\nyour nutrition profile maybe some hard\nlessons that you've had to learn in the\nlast you know nine years of cycling that\nthat maybe is not intuitive for for\nsomeone that's that's just getting into\nbiking uh two things one all things are\nrelative uh and literally relative to\nbody size so when we see you know when\nwe see like U\na pro tour writer taking in 140 grams an\nhour but they're someone that's 63 like\nthey they have a lot of stomach mass and\ndigestive tract to be able to absorb\nthat and muscles to to send it to but\nfor someone who's 5 foot4 and isn't\nworking you know at that same level it\nit's all got to be relative um so that\nwas a big thing for me recognizing that\nyou know kind of going the opposite\ndirection that what it reads in terms of\na a recommended serving size on the back\nof a package uh doesn't suit me um is\nthat are you basically saying that you\nwere under like your nutritional uh\nefforts when at first maybe you were\nunderdoing it you KN you learn to do\nmore yeah so this year in some of my\nbetter events I was taking in about 140\ngrams of carbs an hour um which kind of\ndump Tails into the next thing that I'm\nlearning is that uh at least for me\ntemperature and water requirements uh\nreally play a part in that I I can't\ntake in 140 grams when it's 85 degrees\noutside but when it's 50 degrees outside\nI can just because there's less there's\nless water demand so trying to find that\nright balance um I think I viewed\nhydration and nutrition separate as\nopposed to being things that that worked\nin tandem together which they certainly\ndo work in tandem together so you know\nit was just like well I've got I've got\na hydration pack so I'll I'll try to\nfinish it before the race is done but on\nthe opposite side of that I was very you\nknow I make little Post-it notes where\nit's like uh everything I'm going to eat\nfor a given race and I never mentioned\nhydration or sodium content of what I\nwas eating electrolyte uh makeup in any\nof that so it's it's been learning that\nwater is I mean you know it's it's gas\nin a car it it you nothing runs without\nit um so recognizing the importance of\nthat and then also that that is part of\nthe nutrition equation too it's not it's\nnot a separate a separate matter at\nleast for me do you prefer to eat your\ncarbs or drink your\ncarbs um I prefer to drink them just for\nthe space requirements um I don't I\ndon't love having Pockets loaded up with\nwith gels and things like that uh\nbut then I think you you do sacrifice\nsome of the some of the hydration with\nthat uh I couldn't speak too\nintelligently to the um you know to the\ndietetics of that or like why the\nnutrition aspect of that why that's the\ncase but I know for myself like when I\nhave 12 grams of carbs in a bottle I'm\nI'm losing a lot of the benefit of\nhydration with that so there's there is\na balance but I am not a uh I like I\nlike gels no no solid foods it's not\nthat it's not palatable but just takes\nup more space less\ncarbohydrates um you know I think on the\nbike that's like the one time that we\ncan can eat that like straight race fuel\num that's literally just carbs in liquid\nform um you know that isn't uh a healthy\nbalanced diet off the bike but they're\nmade they're made for that purpose and\nso I think we we should honor that and\nthat's what works well for me favorite\nflavor things that that you're like oh\nthank goodness I have this flavor cuz\nthat's you know you you don't dread\nthere's there's some there's some gel\nflavors at least for me that I I prefer\nprefer not to to have I I don't know do\ndo you have a do you have a preference\nor you're like no all gels are fine you\ndon't care I'm generally a citrus fan uh\nthe the brand that I've been using this\nyear that I've had really good luck with\nis carbs fuel oh yeah yeah great also\nthe value proposition um you know the\nfeed or not not the feed um sis and\nMorton companies like that I I\nappreciate what they're doing but when\nwhen their product is essentially just\nover engineered sugar and it's you know\nit takes you refinancing the the house\nto to train for an event with it uh\nthat's not that's not that's not\npractical I don't think that furthers an\nalready\nexceptionally uh\nexpensive sport I don't think that makes\nit more accessible to others so I\nappreciate what they're doing where they\ntry to make a very value-minded product\nthat also gives you what you need um\nthat doesn't mean it's cheap but it's\ncheaper than the others for sure so\nHarvest fuel uh it's a good a good\nCitrus flavor um and then I love a like\nthe burn of a sparkling water at the end\nof at the end of a race oh at the end I\nwas like what at yes yes yes if it's if\nit's there if it's available to me I\nabsolutely would um yeah I I don't I\nmean soda does it a little bit for but\nfor me just sparkling water you could\njust like chug it and it hurts so bad\nbut it hurts so good at the same time\nthat's that's so Citrus Citrus and that\nand that's sparking water no that makes\nsense yeah we uh so the the series uh is\nsponsored by Hammer nutrition so we have\na lot of those and I think have a um I\nhave passion fruit right now I think in\nmy in my stocks that and peanut butter\nwhich I think are very I I wouldn't\nnecessarily know if I could like connect\nth like combine those two or I'd have to\nbe careful like taking those back to\nback but I uh big fan of the carbs uh\nbrand as well we've talked to them uh\nfun fact they he one of the one of the\nuh co- founders of the company I believe\nuh rides with a team called the holy\ncows out of Colorado and so we had a\ngood laugh about the fact that we have a\nrace in\nalia in July called Alia holy cow so we\nwere trying to see if we could get those\nguys to to to come out and and race with\nus um all right so we've talked about\nnutrition we've talked about training a\nlittle bit in competition and stuff um\nall right to kind of wrap this up\nCharles because this has been fantastic\nuh and we talked a little bit about this\nbut I'm curious uh about two things one\nwhat is one of the best things you think\nabout cycling and then maybe maybe you\ncan start with this or you can end with\nthis whatever you think is is the better\nway your biggest pet peeve when it comes\nto sports so like the the best thing\nabout cycling and your biggest pet peeve\nI'm curious about well I'd like to end\non a positive note so I'll start with\nthe I'll start with the the negatives or\nthe hot takes um for me it's like when\nwe say things\nto whether it's intentional or not to\ntake away from the accomplishment of\nothers like you know if I go to if I go\nto gravel worlds and I have X finishing\ntime that's not a time that I'm happy\nwith that could be a time that someone\nelse is just over the moon with like\nthat that's something that they could go\nto work the next day and tell every\nsingle one of their co-workers about and\njust be smiling from year to year um so\nI think recognizing that our our own\nstandards are relative to ourselves and\nsometimes they should stay that way\num you know so if I have a a bad race I\ndon't need to I don't need to chalk that\nup to anyone else doing anything you\nknow chopping my wheel unless someone\nyou know\ndeliberately hurts me which isn't going\nto happen you know they just they just\nhad a better race they just had better\nlegs they just had better tactics they\nthey just had more luck than I did and\nsometimes that's that's all it is it\ndoesn't need to be uh a reduction of\ntheir um of their accomplishments and\ntheir efforts and and I think that goes\num a number of different ways like\nthere's kind of a a movement of sorts\nwhere people are like anti- writing\ninside but you know I what if anyone's\non a bike whatever it is um whether it's\na pelaton like heck yeah I I'm I'm all\nfor pelaton I don't have a pelaton but I\nlove that someone can buy it train get\nstoked on riding a bike\num and you know they're going to look\nmore favorably on bikes when they're\nwhen they're driving to the convenience\nstore and they have to wait for one\nbecause they're taking a minute to clip\nin at a red light like bikes bikes are\ngood and however someone wants to ride\nthat whether it's indoors outdoors in\nthe rain uh at the gym in the middle of\ntheir\nCrossFit uh workout whatever that's\ncalled like we we should be supporting\nthat and I think especially as get on a\nbike that's the theme right whatever it\nis get on the bike yeah yeah and and\njust celebrating the the accomplishments\nof others um so that's that's kind of\nthe good thing so I suppose kind of\nbringing it full circle like the bike\ndoes so many different things for\ndifferent people it's uh it's a tool for\ntransportation it's um artistic\nexpression you know someone making BMX\nvideos I loved watching BMX and skate\nvideos when I was a kid and like that's\nthat's artistic expression someone who\ntakes the time to put that together and\nit's Fitness it's uh a Burly on the back\nof a bike and it's a bonding experience\nfor a family like a a bike does a lot um\nso I think we should whatever that bike\nlooks like wherever it's at whoever it's\nridden by we should be in support of\nthat because it does so many different\nthings for so many different people and\njust let them enjoy that awesome totally\ngreate all right last question what's\nyour what's your aace this\nyear uh on the schedule uh gravel worlds\nI have a Target time that I'd like to to\nachieve there Midsouth was another one\num and I'm not saying this just to just\nbecause but given the um you know the\nfact that my uncle was from Silver City\nand I had that like kind of emotional\nconnection to that place uh I did really\nreally want to do well there so Midsouth\ngravel worlds and Silver City was a you\nknow a\nb++ sweet sweet I love it and uh hope\nwell hope we'll get you back again\num I'm getting called up for a dinner so\nI I we got to wrap up unfortunately but\nthis has been fantastic Charles um look\nforward to hopefully having you back on\nthe podcast and the podium soon I I will\nbe back on the podium and therefore back\non the\npodcast Perfect all right confidence\ncatch you soon all right",
