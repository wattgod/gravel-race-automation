The full season pass for $399 suggests a dedicated local following, but that's about it."

Travel costs depend on where you're coming from, but this isn't a destination race that justifies flying in."

The 50km backup option at 31 miles keeps the weekend warriors happy while serious riders get a proper workout."

The lack of any specific course description suggests standard Midwest gravel grinding without memorable technical sections."

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "3,600 feet over 62 miles averages 58 feet per mile - enough rolling terrain to keep things interesting without being punishing. This is Iowa climbing: gradual grades that accumulate rather than steep wall-style ascents. No elevation profile or specific climb details found, suggesting nothing worth bragging about."
