      },
      "race_quality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Basic organization with packet pickup at Pisgah City Park and aid stations that close at noon. Route sweeps finish by 2PM, leaving stragglers unsupported – hardly premium race management. The course swings around Preparation Canyon State Park through Loess Hills terrain, but specific route details are thin on the ground."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "You get Loess Hills scenery and climbs that open to vistas, then descents into less-traveled valleys around the Little Sioux River. Pisgah City Park offers camping and showers for the full gravel camping experience. But with podium photos as your main recognition and a meal option at Loess Hills Country Corner, the post-race celebration feels pretty modest."
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Regional Iowa cycling scene that shows up for the full series from May to September. Pisgah City Park becomes the hangout spot for pre and post-race socializing. But there's zero evidence of the passionate community you find at destination gravel events – this feels more like a local club ride with timing chips."
      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "No data on field size or competitive depth in any search results. The fact that it's a Friday-Saturday event in rural Iowa suggests working professionals aren't traveling for this. When even basic participation numbers are invisible, you're looking at a small regional field with limited competitive depth."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Strong value proposition if you're already in Iowa – camping at the start/finish, showers included, and you're getting real elevation gain in the Loess Hills. The $299 Iowa Gravel Series pass covers the full season, making individual race costs reasonable. For Midwest riders, this delivers legitimate climbing without the travel costs of destination events."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Rural Iowa keeps costs manageable with camping at Pisgah City Park and no premium lodging gouging. But getting to western Iowa from anywhere significant means driving hours or flying into distant airports. The series pass model at $299 works if you're doing multiple Iowa events, but one-off participation economics aren't clear."
      },
      "length": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "100km option hits that sweet spot for serious gravel racing, while the 50km gives newer riders an entry point. At roughly 56 miles for the long course, it's substantial enough to matter but won't destroy your weekend. The dual-distance format makes sense for a regional series trying to build participation."
      },
      "technicality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Loess Hills terrain promises some legitimate challenge beyond flat Iowa stereotypes, but specific technical details are missing from all race materials. The hills around Preparation Canyon State Park and river valleys suggest varied terrain, but without surface breakdowns or technical feature descriptions, you're riding blind into whatever Iowa considers challenging."
      },
      "elevation": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "4,000 feet of climbing on the 100km route is legit work in a region not known for vertical gain. The Loess Hills deliver more elevation than Iowa's reputation suggests, with climbs opening to actual vistas. But 4,000 feet over 56 miles isn't going to test anyone who regularly rides real mountains."
      },
      "climate": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Late September in Iowa means unpredictable weather – could be perfect fall conditions or surprise heat/storms. No historical weather data available, but 7AM starts suggest they're worried about something, likely heat or afternoon storms. You're gambling on Midwest weather patterns that can shift dramatically in September."
      },
      "altitude": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Iowa elevation barely registers as a factor in performance or logistics. The Loess Hills might get you a few hundred feet above sea level, but there's zero altitude consideration needed for training or race day execution. This is as close to sea level racing as you get in the continental US."
      },
      "logistics": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Everything happens at Pisgah City Park – parking, packet pickup, start/finish, camping. Simple but basic, with no information about nearest airports or travel logistics for out-of-state riders. The Friday evening packet pickup suggests they expect mostly regional participation who can drive in after work."
      },
      "adventure": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Loess Hills State Forest offers less-traveled gravel through diverse terrain around Soldier River Cutoff – more adventurous than Iowa's corn country reputation suggests. But it's still fundamentally Midwest agricultural region with organized aid stations and swept courses. Real adventure means getting lost in unknown territory, not following marked routes through state parks."
