The Friday evening packet pickup suggests they expect mostly regional participation who can drive in after work."

        "explanation": "The 60-mile distance hits that productive middle ground for weekend gravel racing, substantial enough to create real suffering without destroying recovery. Gary Wenzl's cramping experience shows the challenge accumulates - starting strong but 'with 30 miles left to go, I started getting leg cramps' and 'last 5 miles was torture.' Similar distance to Crusher in the Tushar."
      },
      "technicality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Course features steeper climbing than Iowa's reputation suggests, with one climb reportedly hitting 17% gradient near the top according to post-race discussions. Route winds through Loess Hills State Forest and around Preparation Canyon State Park, but specific technical features remain undefined beyond the climbing gradients. Less technical than The Mid South."
      },
      "elevation": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Gary Wenzl recorded 2,720 feet on the wet route but called it 'some of the most challenging' climbing he'd experienced, with that 17% grade conversation happening over lunch afterward. The climbing opens to vistas with descents into less-traveled valleys around Little Sioux River, delivering more vertical than typical Iowa terrain. Less climbing than The Mid South."
      },
      "climate": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Late September weather ran 47°F to 57°F in 2025 with overcast skies throughout, ideal temperature conditions that didn't prevent severe cramping issues. Pre-race rain forced route modifications to avoid dangerous wet sections, suggesting weather-dependent course variations are standard operating procedure. More weather exposure than Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego. As Gary Wenzl puts it: \"This was my first race after recovering from a crash in June. Due to rain, they went with the 'very wet route,' which took out all MMRs and some very scenic roads.\""
      },
      "altitude": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Iowa elevation barely registers as a performance factor. The Loess Hills provide some relief above surrounding farmland, but you're still fundamentally racing at near sea level with zero altitude considerations for training or race day execution. Lower altitude than Gravel Worlds — no thin-air concerns."
      },
      "adventure": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Loess Hills State Forest offers less-traveled gravel through diverse terrain around Soldier River Cutoff – more adventurous than Iowa's corn country reputation suggests. But it's still fundamentally Midwest agricultural region with organized aid stations and swept courses. Real adventure means getting lost in unknown territory, not following marked routes through state parks."
      },
      "prestige": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Part of the Iowa Gravel Series but zero name recognition outside the Midwest. No pro field, no notable winners in the search results, no YouTube coverage. It's a regional series race that markets itself as 'The best of Iowa gravel racing' – which tells you everything about its actual standing in the sport."
      },
      "race_quality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Organization handles weather adaptations with alternative routes when conditions demand it, switching to the 'very wet route' for safety. Aid stations close at noon with route sweeps finishing by 2PM, leaving later finishers unsupported. Navigation challenges remain - even experienced riders like Shawna Young take wrong turns."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "You get Loess Hills scenery and climbs that open to vistas, then descents into less-traveled valleys around the Little Sioux River. Pisgah City Park offers camping and showers for the full gravel camping experience. But with podium photos as your main recognition and a meal option at Loess Hills Country Corner, the post-race celebration feels pretty modest. As Gary Wenzl puts it: \"This was my first race after recovering from a crash in June. Due to rain, they went with the 'very wet route,' which took out all MMRs and some very scenic roads.\""
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Marketed as friendly to newcomers - 'a ride that you can invite your family or buddy to that's new to gravel grinding' with well-marked routes. Post-race meal and camping at the venue creates social atmosphere, though small fields suggest limited regional participation rather than destination event status."
      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "With a field of 50-100 riders, no data on field size or competitive depth in any search results. It's a Friday-Saturday event in rural Iowa suggests working professionals aren't traveling for this. When even basic participation numbers are invisible, you're looking at a small regional field with limited competitive depth. Thinner field than Ouray Gravel Grinder."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Strong value proposition if you're already in Iowa – camping at the start/finish, showers included, and you're getting real elevation gain in the Loess Hills. The $299 Iowa Gravel Series pass covers the full season, making individual race costs reasonable. For Midwest riders, this delivers climbing without the travel costs of destination events."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Rural Iowa keeps lodging costs minimal with camping and showers at the start/finish venue. Season pass model at $399 works for regional riders hitting multiple events, though getting to western Iowa requires significant drive time from any major population center outside the immediate region. Similar expense level to Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."
