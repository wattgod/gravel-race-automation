      "summary": "Southern Cross is what happens when you build a gravel race for climbers, descenders, and wine drinkers. This is NOT Kansas. It's the North Georgia Appalachians\u2014steep, punchy, unrelenting. The Montaluce Winery start/finish is chef's kiss: you suffer for 5-7 hours on red clay climbs, then roll into a vineyard where volunteers hand you wine, BBQ, and a chair with a mountain view. It's the only gravel race where you might actually want to stay at the finish line longer than it took to ride the race. The course is honest suffering\u2014no gimmicks, just real North Georgia topography. If you're a diesel engine who thrives on sustained power, this will hurt. If you're a punchy climber who can recover on descents, you'll love it.",

        "Mud lottery\u2014if it rains the week before, course becomes significantly harder (18% DNF in 2023)",
        "Limited aid stations\u201435+ miles between stations means self-sufficiency required",
        "Lodging pressure\u2014Dahlonega is tiny, hotels fill fast, likely driving from Gainesville",
        "Cold March starts\u201435-40\u00b0F mornings, dress wrong and you're numb for an hour",

      "bottom_line": "If you want flat, fast, tactical pack racing, this isn't it. If you want punchy climbs, technical descents, and a winery finish that makes you forget your legs hurt\u2014Southern Cross delivers. This is the Southeast's answer to mountain gravel: smaller field, bigger personality, and a post-race party that justifies the entry fee alone. You'll either love the relentless rollers or walk up Woody Gap. But you'll definitely drink good wine at the end."
