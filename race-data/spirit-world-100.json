It's 12 miles\nfrom some of the best gravel road riding\nin the United States.\n&gt;&gt; And we wanted to open up the spirit\nworld to be a part of the downtown\nscene. But you're afraid\nI\njust\n&gt;&gt; cycling has allowed gravel road cycling\nspecifically uh and hiking and mountain\nbiking on the Arizona Trail has really\nopened up just another opportunity for\nPatagonia to be really proud of where it\nsits in the Sky Island ecosystem.

you invest in the future while\npreserving the past\nthis is 72 hours in patagonia arizona\n[Music]\nand we're your hosts the coyote\ncollective\na group of best friends mountain\nathletes and brand storytelling agency\nwhy do we come to patagonia\nthis town of 900 offers something\nspecial in the world\nwith hundreds of miles of ranch roads\nfor perfect gravel riding which allow us\nto use the bike as a context for\nexploration and storytelling\nhmm\n7 a.m is the perfect time for a cup of\ncoffee and some space to clear your head\nand it's my chance to catch up with my\nfriend xander alt\nwho co-owns the gravel house patagonia\nlumber company\nand spirit world 100.\ni'm xander alt my wife heidi and i own\nthe patagonia lumber company as well as\npatagonia's gravel road race the spirit\nworld 100.\nthe patagonia lumber company its\noriginal building was established in\n1913 as a field office for the arizona\ntimber company based out of flagstaff\narizona\nthe patagonia lumber company as it is\nnow came about because\nlong-time patagonia resident and\ncommunity member ted piper noticed the\nincrease in outdoor recreational tourism\nand so he asked us our thoughts on\nwhether or not tourism might continue to\nincrease or\nwhether or not it would continue to be a\npart of patagonia's community for the\nforeseeable future and\nwhether or not we had any advice for him\non how to use this old building\nwe said let's open up a community\ngathering space that serves coffee beer\nand wine and we'll think about what the\nfood program is later\nbecause we refer to\nthe the pursuit of endurance as breaking\nthrough into the spirit world that space\nis different for everybody and we really\nliked the description of that because\nit's so inclusive in that way we all\nexperience it in a different way we all\nbreak through that line we all then come\nback out of it and we have our own\nstories the 100 mile race being being\nthe big boy of it\nthe organization that is the spirit\nworld 100\nis dedicated to how we appropriately\nintroduce people to how you travel here\nand interact with what is a really\nintricate design of public and private\nland but three days of music and bikes\nbeer drinking and revelry in the first\nweekend of november every year\nsome of my favorite characteristics of\nthe 100 mile course are what riders\nexperience throughout it it starts out\nwith a 17 and a half mile line to the\ntop of ducane pass and then you descend\ninto low kill arizona just in that one\nstretch you see everything that you will\nthen see across the entire course itself\nso within 7000 feet of climbing you're\ngoing up and down and up and down and\nthen down again and then up again it's a\nreally incredible way to test yourself\nacross a landscape that will give you an\nopportunity to really experience who you\nare not only as an athlete but as a\nhuman as well\nthe spirit world 100 is\nincredible\nand challenging\nit kind of has a little bit of\neverything uh you get some steep long\nclimbs you get hot sun-exposed descents\nyou get rocky shelves\ncreek crossings that splash you up in\nthe face\ndeep sand pits where you're fishtailing\nand just holding on for dear life at 25\nmiles an hour on your gravel bike\n[Applause]\npatagonia doesn't have a lot of\nrestaurants but they're all pretty dang\ngood uh pancho villa has\nthe most incredible breakfast burrito\nsonoran style with uh\ncharred jalapeno served on the side\nand\nthe restaurants and the people and the\nbusinesses of patagonia\nare\ntotally bringing it uh which kind of\nreinforces the\nthis idea that everyone here is\nthe ultimate version of of themselves\nacross the street from ponchovia is the\ngathering grounds which is\npretty appropriately named it's a place\nfor locals old-timers tourists cyclists\npretty much anyone that passes through\npatagonia to hang out and grab a cup and\nslice of the best pie that i've had\nanywhere\nmy name's andrew gowans i live in\npatagonia and we live on an off-grid\nproperty\nout in the valley i do a lot of riding\nin this valley so a real special place\nto live so i was standing outside\njust on the street here and this crew\nfrom ventum rolled up and said\nyou want to come and have coffee with us\nso we talked about bikes and we talked\nabout life and\nliving in patagonia living in colorado\nand our shared experience of being\npeople that ride bicycles\ngravel cycling is is what brought me\nhere but the sanderfell valley has\nanother name\nand that's arizona wine country this\nplace\nis a little pocket of the right micro\nclimate and features and topography and\nweather\nthat allows some pretty special wines to\nbe made wine culture and influence\ni think expresses itself most clearly in\nthe\nway of life here and the approach to\ndoing things right or not at all and\nthat good things take time\nit would be nearly impossible to come to\nthe madrian sky islands and patagonia\narizona without realizing that there was\nsomething special here right that this\nplace is something special in the world\nthe biking is a context just like\nclimbing skiing running you name it is a\ncontext right it's something that you\nlay over\nwhat is already a beautiful canvas we've\ntalked us about this idea of a canvas\nwith xander and heidi that canvas is\nequally blank for everyone that comes\nhere for me\ni saw a chance to\nstep into the most real version of\nmyself\nbecause you can't get here accidentally\nlife doesn't float you along to\npatagonia\nthe level of intentionality\nthat the residents of patagonia\nfull-time and otherwise\nhave brought to their lives and\nby proxy this town and this valley and\nthis region\nis a real thing\nwe're not here to\nfit a narrative onto it\nwe're just lucky to be part of it\noh",

Riders face 7000 feet of climbing with constant ups and downs throughout the 100-mile route. The course includes technical challenges like deep sand pits where riders fishtail at 25 mph, creek crossings that splash riders, rocky shelves, and hot sun-exposed descents. Wind can be a significant factor, blowing consistently and making the ride substantially more difficult. The race takes place in early November and is part of a three-day festival featuring music, cycling, and community celebration. The course utilizes hundreds of miles of ranch roads around Patagonia, Arizona, located 18 miles north of the Mexican border. The terrain offers access to 90,000 acres of open space in the Sonoita Valley."
