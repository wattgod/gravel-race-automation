The self-supported format eliminates aid stations but routes riders past Casey's convenience stores at miles 38, 69, 100, and 138. Weather-forced course reroutes happen last-minute—Friday rains \"forced a couple of re-routes before the race started\" in 2018."

Scott's navigation error added 30 miles to his day, turning 180 into an 18-hour ordeal that nearly broke him. Distance options from 70 to 200 miles accommodate different suffering tolerances, with Kate Geisen noting the unsupported format meant \"just you and the C-store shelves.\""

Scott on his fat bike \"was able to ride probably more than most\" but still walked most of the 3-5 mile B-road sections. In 2018, Adrienne Taren found a rider \"poking at his very, very muddy bike with a stick\" after the \"fat bike\" became unrideable through ankle-deep mud."

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Mid-October Iowa weather swings violently, as the 2018 race proved with severe attrition. Adrienne Taren reported that \"the second I hit the Iowa border, the rain-pocalypse broke loose. Also, the temperature dropped 20-some degrees.\" The 2019 start was delayed 40 minutes for thunderstorms with lightning, while recent years saw \"extremely dusty\" conditions with 30 mph wind gusts."

      "altitude": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Iowa farmland means zero altitude considerations. You're starting around 1000 feet and staying in similar elevation throughout the rolling countryside. No acclimatization needed, no thin-air excuses available—your suffering comes from distance and elevation gain, not oxygen deprivation."
      },
      "adventure": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Self-supported navigation through unmarked Iowa farm roads creates real adventure without wilderness risk. Scott encountered wildlife throughout: \"I saw too many deer, rabbits, raccoon, possum and a few cats in this dark-thirty stretch.\" Two farm dogs followed him for 5-7 miles each, \"having a ball.\" The remote course offers solitude—elite finisher noted you're \"free to ride all day long\" with just the sunrise as your companion."
      },
      "prestige": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Regional Iowa event with limited national recognition outside gravel circles. The 120-rider cap keeps it intimate but invisible—Kate Geisen noted \"not being a regular to the Iowa gravel scene, I saw few familiar faces.\" HP Ultra Cycling's reference to race director Sarah Cooper as \"one of your heroes\" reflects respect within ultradistance circles rather than mainstream gravel media attention."

        "explanation": "Severe weather creates organizational challenges—2018 saw only 22 of 57 starters finish the 150-mile distance after hypothermic conditions and course reroutes. The bare-bones approach works for self-sufficient riders but offers zero safety net. Scott noted \"by Checkpoint #1, the race had already claimed a few derailleurs and hypothermic conditions forced many others to drop.\""
      },

        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "150 miles through Iowa's rolling hills delivers suffering without the circus. The 'odyssey through serene landscapes' marketing actually undersells the real experience—8000 feet of climbing over farm roads where your only company is corn and your own thoughts. It's pure, unfiltered gravel racing stripped of everything but the essential hurt."

        "explanation": "Regional Iowa field of weekend warriors and corn country crushers, not national talent. Scott's casual training approach—\"30 minutes to an hour\" rides for a month before attempting 200 miles—suggests recreational rather than competitive focus. The 120-rider cap and Iowa location naturally limits participation to regional riders and ultradistance masochists rather than drawing competitive depth from national gravel scene."

        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Entry fees unavailable in research, but the no-frills approach suggests typical Iowa pricing well under $150. Race director allows free lawn camping at her house, eliminating lodging costs for hardy riders. The self-supported format means zero aid station expenses passed to riders, though it dumps all nutrition costs on participants. Value proposition centers on pure distance suffering without expensive race production overhead."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Winterset's proximity to Des Moines keeps flights reasonable but requires rental car for the 30-mile drive. Free camping option at race director's house eliminates lodging costs for tent-capable riders, though small Iowa towns offer limited hotel competition. Scott's fat bike setup and Adrienne's cold-weather gear highlight equipment needs for Iowa's unpredictable October conditions and muddy Level B roads that destroy standard gravel setups."
