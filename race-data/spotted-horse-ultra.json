The self-supported format eliminates aid stations but routes riders past Casey's convenience stores at miles 38, 69, 100, and 138.

Scott's navigation error added 30 miles to his day, turning 180 into an 18-hour ordeal that nearly broke him. Distance options from 70 to 200 miles accommodate different suffering tolerances, with Kate Geisen noting the unsupported format meant \"just you and the C-store shelves.\" Among the longest in gravel, comparable to Badlands."

In 2018, Adrienne Taren found a rider \"poking at his very, very muddy bike with a stick\" after the \"fat bike\" became unrideable through ankle-deep mud. Less technical than The Mid South."

        "explanation": "Kate Geisen encountered \"a virtual gravel wall\" climb where she was \"pretty excited to make it to the top without having to walk.\" The 8000 feet of elevation gain over 150 miles comes through Iowa's rolling terrain—constant ups and downs rather than epic climbs.

Adrienne Taren reported that \"the second I hit the Iowa border, the rain-pocalypse broke loose. Also, the temperature dropped 20-some degrees.\" The 2019 start was delayed 40 minutes for thunderstorms with lightning, while recent years saw \"extremely dusty\" conditions with 30 mph wind gusts. More weather exposure than Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

Scott encountered wildlife throughout: \"I saw too many deer, rabbits, raccoon, possum and a few cats in this dark-thirty stretch.\" Two farm dogs followed him for 5-7 miles each, \"having a ball.\" The remote course offers solitude—elite finisher noted you're \"free to ride all day long\" with just the sunrise as your companion."

The 120-rider cap keeps it intimate but invisible—Kate Geisen noted \"not being a regular to the Iowa gravel scene, I saw few familiar faces.\" HP Ultra Cycling's reference to race director Sarah Cooper as \"one of your heroes\" reflects respect within ultradistance circles rather than mainstream gravel media attention."

It's pure, unfiltered gravel racing stripped of everything but the essential hurt."

Scott's casual training approach—\"30 minutes to an hour\" rides for a month before attempting 200 miles—suggests recreational rather than competitive focus. The 120-rider cap and Iowa location naturally limits participation to regional riders and ultradistance masochists rather than drawing competitive depth from national gravel scene. Less competitive depth than Almanzo 100."

The self-supported format means zero aid station expenses passed to riders, though it dumps all nutrition costs on participants. Value proposition centers on pure distance suffering without expensive race production overhead."

      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Registration runs $150-200. Winterset's proximity to Des Moines keeps flights reasonable but requires rental car for the 30-mile drive. Free camping option at race director's house eliminates lodging costs for tent-capable riders, though small Iowa towns offer limited hotel competition. Scott's fat bike setup and Adrienne's cold-weather gear highlight equipment needs for Iowa's unpredictable October conditions and muddy Level B roads that destroy standard gravel setups. Similar expense level to Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

          "transcript": "[Music]\nwelcome to the bike talk with Dave\npodcast I'm your host Dave Mabel thanks\nfor tuning in today we're talking with\nKelsey and Cole lead better the two\nfounders of the Iowa gravel project and\nthe Redfield rock and roll gravel\nrace also this winter it was announced\nthat these two are taking over two\nlongstanding gravel races the Iowa\ngravel classic and the spotted horse\nUltra I was curious what led to this\ndevelopment and what personal touches\nthey had planned for these events but I\nalso wondered what led them to the Iowa\ngravel project and how it all got\nstarted and that's where we begin with\nKelsey and Cole lead\nbetter Kelsey and cold lead B\npodcast uh Cole we've been talking about\ngetting you on for a long time but I'm\nglad we waited because we've got\nsomething exciting to talk about um but\nuh you just also have a ton of stories\ntoo you've been around the gravel world\nfor a long time so I'm excited to have\nyou two on uh Kelsey I want to introduce\nyou guys individual we'll start with\nKelsey uh Kelsey uh the of voice in my\near host of the gravel nits podcast\nbiker rag\nBrier and um you know race director uh\nwelcome to bike talk with Dave Kelsey\nthanks Dave\nabsolutely and Cole Leed better Cole\nYou've Been a gravel cyclist for a long\ntime and um uh again race director and\nand I believe you both I don't the full\nhistory we'll dive into that but um I'm\ngoing to give you both credit for the\nIowa gravel project Kelsey will you take\nsome credit for that I'll take some\ncredit but it's mostly him all right\nfair enough but uh Cole welcome to bike\ntalk with Dave how's it going Dave it's\ngoing awesome good to see you both well\nthanks for joining me here on a Tuesday\nnight this is going to be a rare podcast\nbecause uh this is going to drop\ntomorrow morning so I got my homework\nahead of me we hop off this thing but\nthis will be a you know nice fresh\nalmost live bike talk with Dave which is\nkind of fun and\nrare um so I I want to start with\nCole because I believe Cole was the um\nkind of the foray of your relationship\ninto the world of\ngravel uh is that a fair\nstatement Kelsey you're nodding your\nhead there so yeah oh\nyeah I we both definitely have gravel of\nhistory that goes deep many well past\nthe two of us but as far as the\nexistence of how gravel is in a\nrelationship he was a starter yeah dig\nit well let me start with that Kelsey\nbecause you said your gravel history\ngoes back before the two of you were\nwere together um what was your history\nwith cycling and then gravel uh I grew\nup on gravel road um from it's time I\ncould ride a bike it was down a gravel\nroad I could ride to the end of the\ngravel and I couldn't go any further so\nI got used to riding on the gravel road\nhow far was that oh maybe half a mile\ndown to the end of the street but you\nknow as a kid that's a long ways it is a\nlong ways I actually grew up on a gravel\nroad as well and like I\nmean we didn't ride gravel for the sake\nof gravel we rode gravel to get off the\ngravel so that we could get to town get\nto the mall or get to get anywhere\nanywhere yeah Safeway\nfor um candy bars\nor um Laffy Taffy like that's I would go\nto Safeway I would ride my bike to\nSafeway for Laffy Taffy or we'd ride to\nthe arcade but anyway I grew up on a\ngravel road too and all we could think\nabout was getting off of the\ngravel um Cole what about you what uh\nwhat's your bike history\num actually very similar uh I grew\nup about an eighth mile from a gravel\nroad uh but I was on a highway and so I\nwasn't allowed to cross the highway\nuntil I was about 10 years old but then\nafter that I could go anywhere I wanted\npretty much and had hundreds of Acres\nacross the street to wander around but I\ncould always even when I was younger\nride down the shoulder and go down to\nthe Gravel Road and then my parents\ndidn't care where I rode my bike pretty\nmuch from the time I could ride I was\nalways on my bike uh my parents didn't\nground me uh they grounded me from my\nbike and that was the worst thing they\ncould do to me is get me away from my\nbike so that was how they punished\nme um but I was I we lived about a mile\nand a half maybe close to two miles from\nfrom uh school and so I rode my bike\nevery day to school too all through\nwinter well a large portion of winter at\nleast so I was riding a lot from a kid\nso that was uh kind of my thing when I\ngot back from uh California I started\nback into cycling\nabout 2011 or so I randomly picked up a\nmountain bike uh at Play It Again Sports\njust saw used mountain bike and was like\na couple hundred dollars up I I used to\nlike riding let's grab one and see you\nknow and then immediately started\nlooking up like where the uh are there\nany mountain bike trails even around de\nMo because I'm like it's Iowa do we\nreally have\nthose and so then I discovered that and\nthen it wasn't long after that that was\na really heavy old Trek mountain bike uh\nthere was well past its usage but uh it\nwas the start and then I kind of if I'm\ngoing to be doing this all the time I\nmight as well get something good so I\nwent and bought a real nice new mountain\nbike and then started riding quite a bit\nand then got into uh One race where I\nraced the dirty Deo here in town raced\nthat once and then after that got more\ninto\nragb and was in ragb for a bit but then\nhated the road riding and the skinny\ntires really so then I kept hearing\nstuff about gravel and that would have\nbeen about 2014 or so 15 and so then I\ngot another bike and started riding\ngravel then uh it's always funny because\nI come back to the first race I did and\nyou see a picture of me in very much not\ncyclist clothes on a mountain bike\nducked down looking like I'm trying to\ngo as fast as possible and then you have\nthe a division coming behind because it\nwas a circuit race of course but you the\na division right behind me in the\npicture just flying by me but I'm all\nlooking like I'm\nserious they're just about to fly by me\na great picture to remember yep yep\nthat's funny when you say that I think\nand this is a to sidebar but that's what\nI'm known for so I'll sidebar uh I have\na picture of my youngest kid at a high\nschool track meet he was running it\nmight have been the two mile I'm sure it\nwas a two mile and uh he was about to\nget lapped and I've got a picture of him\ncoming up to towards the Finish Line\nwith like two of the fastest guys in the\nstate coming up behind him but he's\ndefinitely leading coming across the\nFinish Line I love it and I actually\nhave a picture of myself leading the\nsingle speed national championships in\nwhen they were in Tacoma\nWashington um it I might have been\ngetting\nlapped I'll never say but Jake Wells is\nbehind me that's all I'm saying right\nthere so I appreciate that uh where\nwhere did you guys grow up what um back\nto your uh Gravel Road upbringing what\nuh what part of the world were you in\nwhen you grew up on gravel\nroads let see I was just between Ames\nand Gilbert oh okay so locally here yep\nhow about you Cole\nRedfield dig it hence the Redfield rock\nand roll I wondered what your connection\nthere was so that makes sense all right\nIowa grown gravel Riders I love it so\nCole you can't make too much fun of\nragb uh because you guys have a bit of a\nhistory on ragb\nuh Kelsey what happened on ragb and what\nwas\nthe um what was the town it started with\na Alden Alden thank you what happened in\nAlden on rag best town by a\ndam um well we got married on rag Ray\nthat's awesome tell me about\nthat well there is a uh wonderful bike\nrace ride what you want it to be a race\nor a ride called the sterile Ian is held\nevery year out of um Alden there in town\nuh just outside of town is wonderful\ngravel roads and we decided that was a\nbeautiful place to get married and it\njust so happened that rag R was going to\nbe going through town there it was going\nto be the end of the first ever gravel\nday of rag\ngray and why not a better place to get\nmarried wow that's like everything\ncoming together isn't it\nexactly huh that's cool were you guys\ngoing to get married anyway or you're\nlike ah there's that gravel ride on ragb\nit ends in Alden let's just get married\nit kind of all just fell together really\nyes uh yeah it just kind of all fell\ntogether I look we were riding in the\ncar one day and I I don't know who\nexactly brought it up but we kind of\nlooked at each other and I know I said\nwas like this is dumb like what are we\nwhat are we procrastinating like we're\neventually going to get married we might\nas well just get\nmarried and\nthen all of a sudden rag BR came up and\nthen it just happened to be the first\never alternate gravel route and so it's\nlike well that's a automatic and then we\nhad actually become pretty good friends\nwith uh deer Drake the race or the ride\ndirector for ragb at that time and so\ndeer was definitely instrumental and\njust making things happen too uh when I\nmessaged him and told him that because I\nwas already going to be making\nappearances across the gravel day and we\nhad uh all the volunteers and Iowa\ngravel project shirts and\nstuff but then all of a sudden I'm like\nI'm going to get married that day as\nwell and just rolled with it he like\nokay well where do you want to get\nmarried he's like do you want to do it\nout on the gravel or do you want to do\nit in town or what do you want to do and\nI sent him a picture of the little\ncute I don't even know what you call\ngazebo thing like gazebo but just a\nreally cute little white gazebo right\nnext to the\nriver and as was like\nhere he's like okay give me 10 minutes\nI'm actually on the phone with uh the\nmayor of the town already so give me 10\nminutes and then a few minutes later he\nmessaged me back he's like okay they'll\nhave everything prepped for you uh\nyou'll be good to go it's like okay he's\nlike anything else just let me know he's\nlike we will TR our best to make it\nhappen and pretty much my one other\nrequest was well after I get married\nhonestly I'd like to have a beer with my\nfriends so if we can make that\nhappen and he's like don't worry I got\nyou and so then the Iowa craft beer tent\nwas 75 fet away from where we stood to\nget\nmarried so it all literally just fell\ninto place\nperfectly ragb is so many cool things\nhappen there's so\nmany uh family histories people\nhistories that happen on ragb and that's\na great I love that story that's ragb\nmagic which it's not why we're here\ntalking today but I love that I think\nthat's super\ncool we are talking about bike races and\nI feel like it goes all the way back to\nthe Iowa gravel project what is the Iowa\ngravel project and\nI mean how in the heck is\nit I don't know if it's big or not but\nit appears big everywhere you go you see\nIowa gravel project shirts jerseys hats\nsigns\nwhatever tell me the story of the Iowa\ngravel\nproject so uh the Iowa gravel project I\nuh I actually started it in late\n2017 would have been uh going into\nwinter and I was kind of in uh honestly\nnot the greatest mental space at the\ntime and was uh literally sitting alone\nin my house just staring at the wall\nwith nothing going on and I was just\nlike I have to do something like this is\nstupid I can't keep doing this like I\nhave to get myself out of this funk I\nneed a project I need something and I\nalso at the same time I wanted to get\nmore involved with with gravel because I\nwas already involved with it but I\nwanted to be more involved with it and\nso also on top of that I had noticed\nthat at the time it felt like there was\na bit of a disconnect in the state\nbecause a lot of people from one side of\nthe state didn't know people from the\nother side of the state and we're all a\nsmall little Community like we're one\nbig small community so there's no reason\nwhy those people shouldn't know each\nother you know and so I wanted somewhere\nthat would be a space that wouldn't be\nlike some of the other uh bicycle groups\nthat you could ask a simple question and\nnot get jumped on because why would you\nask that you should know that well I\ndon't know that because that's why I'm\nasking this you know and we also had\njust a wealth of knowledge in this\nCommunity like just it's amazing what we\nhave in this\ncommunity uh one person I will I will\ncall out specifically is great grand\nGeorge that man has a wealth of\nknowledge and as much as he does get\npaid because he's a coach to impart that\nin people he's also more than happy to\nhere's an article I wrote here's a Blog\nI wrote check this out and it is amazing\nthe amount of knowledge out of that one\nperson so if we can connect the whole\nCommunity together that's just going to\nbe better for everybody because you can\ngive somebody a tip in their first six\nmonths of doing this you can give them\nthe smallest tip that you don't even\nreally think much of but it can make the\nworld a difference for them and so like\neach one of those small little things\nthat people learn that again seem\ninsignificant to people that know them\nand have known\nthem it just brings everybody up at that\npoint and\nso Iowa gravel and it was my project for\nthe winter so uh kind of grew from there\nand then just exploded what do you guys\ndo what is\nit uh basically just promoting gravel\naround Iowa and gravel uh like Iowa\ngravel to other people outside of the\nstate um it's kind of weird I've had\nthis conversation a couple of times uh\nthat we're actually unfortunate here\nbecause we have so much great gravel so\nmany great races that we don't end up\nhaving one standout race that blows up\nlike some of the bigger\nraces at the same time it's kind of hard\nnot to say that we want to keep it for\nourselves because it is this\ngem but at the same time you also\nyou want people to know how good our\nstuff is here you know and we have so\nmany races that are just awesome across\nthe state again we almost have too many\nbecause you're every weekend you have a\nchoice basically yep yep that's an\naccurate statement uh I've often said\nthe same thing that uh\nI and I mean I literally there are\nlisteners around the world that listen\nto bike talk with Dave I don't know if\nit's like a bot in Germany that's\nlistening or an actual human or not and\nif you're in Germany hello um I don't\neven know\nuh I know how to say goodbye how do you\nsay hello in German Ola no that's\nSpanish that's\nSpanish don't know German too oh man bad\nme anyway um hell hello hello hello H oh\nmy gosh anyway sorry everybody\nbut um I I know I'm biased but I really\nfeel like the gravel Revolution started\nhere and it started with trans Iowa\nand there really as you just kind of\npointed out there isn't a marquee event\nthere's a marquee event in Kansas\nthere's a marquee event in Nebraska\nthere's a marquee\nevent um I don't know where's it\nOklahoma\nTexas why not Iowa but you're right we\nhave a million smaller\nGrassroots community events\nwhere a hundred couple hundred people\nwill get together have a great day\nriding\ngravel having a beer afterwards having a\npork sandwich afterwards having pizza\nafterwards and then um go home or go\nlisten to music or something so um yeah\nkind of two sides of that coin isn't\nit um but I love that you're promoting\nIowa gravel because again we've got\nfreaking a million miles of gravel and\num it's great gravel and great little\ncommunities and every freaking 10 or 15\nmiles there's a little town with a\nconvenience store in it yeah I mean\nwe're honestly just absolutely blessed\nwith gravel here\nbecause the majority of the state is set\nup on almost mile by mile or mile by 2\nMile squares and\nrectangles you you can't barely get lost\nyou know and on top of that like you see\na lot of other states that I'll go to\nand uh their gravel roads they're so\nnarrow like ours are meant to get\nequipment down like big equipment so we\nhave big wide gravel roads and just very\nwellmaintained for the same\nequipment so\nit's we're we're fortunate to kind\nof enjoy that portion of it too you know\nand in all reality that's kind of the\nfun thing in the fall time is to see\nlike the Harvest and stuff you know and\nwatch that it's always kind of fun yep\nno doubt what were you gonna say Kelsey\nI was going to say and we get our Fair\nmix of our smaller you know Market roads\ntoo that are B roads and Loan m\nand give us those you know Venture\naspects we do have B- roads don't we um\nI did trans Iowa version two and I made\nit 63 of the 300 and some miles and of\nthose 63 miles maybe it was 68\nmiles 23 or 24 miles were B- roads and I\nwalked 23 or 24 miles out of my 63 miles\nCU they were on wet muddy oh\nB roads So when you say B roads that's\nwhere my mind goes so not a Silling\nPoint unless it's dry and then they're\nlike freaking highways super\nfun um all\nright three\nraces red field rock and roll is where\nit all began in Kelsey I have to say I\nlisten to uh gravel knits and I heard\nyou\nsay putting on a racist so hard actually\nI should probably talk about that later\nbut um you were talking about putting on\nthe uh Redfield rock and\nroll um it's kind of where it began for\nguys where did Redfield Rock and Roll\ncome from what is it and\num uh what makes it unique oh\ngoodness it it is hard but it's very\nfulfilling in so many ways it's\ndefinitely worth it the time of the\neffort and everything\num where do you want to start\ncall uh fifth year is it uh we're\nlooking at year number five coming up\nyep uh we started in 2020 uh it was\nplanned well\nbefore everything that happened in\n2020 um but uh I wanted to show off some\nof the gravel roads that I grew up on\nnot only riding my bike on but traveling\nback and forth all over you know uh as a\nkid because uh when I came back from\nCalifornia in 2008 and then started\nriding into gravel uh exploring some of\nthe gravel roads and the scenery and\nstuff around\nthere it kind of amazed me I was kind of\nblind by being surrounded by it when I\nwas a kid I didn't realize how beautiful\nsome of the areas were you know and how\ndiverse the areas can be within a few\nmiles of each other as well um so at\nthat point I wanted to show them off to\nmy friends and in all reality gravel had\ngiven me so much at that point already\nthat I wanted to do my part to try and\ngive something back you know I I\nremember hearing a few race directors\nsaying that over the years and it really\nstuck with me uh that that was their way\nto give back to the community and uh as\nKelsey said it's difficult but at the\nsame time uh for me personally the\npayoff is at the end when I get to hear\nthe stories and see the smiles on my\nfriends\nfaces um but Redfield uh I I originally\nwanted to eventually make it into\nsomething\nbig and like actually have music and\neverything else going on and it was kind\nof funny because uh year three we\nactually uh had an amazing band the\nsheet play and it was awesome time but\nunfortunately that same day it was low\n50s and raining and windy and cold and\njust yeah it was horrendous conditions I\nmean really bad talk about walking your\nbike a lot of people walk their bike a\nday yeah it was it was pretty\nnasty uh and afterward words like I was\njust running around cuz we do we do the\nrace on a very small amount of\nvolunteers generally kind mostly our\nfamilies talking about tightnit\nyeah so it was crazy CU I just ran all\nover the place just like crazy uh trying\nto keep everything going CU our Finish\nLine is actually outside of town so\npeople aren't racing in on the highways\nand stuff so they finish about a mile\noutside of town and then have to ride\nback in and uh having the Finish Line\nparty separate from the actual Finish\nLine was difficult\nbecause I didn't leave myself enough\nhelp\nand on the Finish Line I feel your pain\nI ended up just running around and I\nnever got to enjoy anything and the\nmusic it was awesome but it was also\nkind of loud so everybody's kind of\ntrying to yell over each other and stuff\nuh we\nactually we were so incredibly lucky\nthat year because um knowing that it was\ngoing to rain and it was going to be\nnasty we were going to lose people and\nwe'd already paid for the band and\neverything so we were going to lose\npeople pretty badly if we were going to\ntry and hold it anywhere but near where\nwe were ending and everything or the\npark and everything in town and\nfortunately\num Steve Roberts the owner of the\ndexfield\ndiner uh he\nwas he was out of town for a wedding on\nthat day and so the diner was shut down\nhe literally just is like here's the\ncode to get in clean up when you're done\nyou got your own alcohol\nright wow and that that's the beauty of\nsmall towns you and um I actually he was\na handful years older than me in school\nbut I knew him from years ago so it was\nkind of cool um I do have to bring up at\nthat point uh Steve and his family had a\nhorrible tragedy and their Diner burned\ndown uh yeah that was just\ncomplo yeah so uh they'll be in the\nprocess of rebuilding that and uh\nraising money and everything just to\ndeal with that whole entire thing it's\njust so sad because they've put their\nheart into that place like there was a\nlot of love in that yeah and that Diner\nwas kind of the lifeblood of that kind\nof small town square right there it was\nit was bringing things back in that area\num when he moved back and got that\nstarted up he really poured everything\ninto kind of Reviving The Town a bit uh\nwhich he was immediately a big supporter\nof the Redfield rock and roll because\nhe's like wait there's a bike race in\ntown like who's doing this bike race and\nthen so I got to meet him and he\nimmediately is like whatever I can do to\nhelp it's like well can we hold check in\nhere yeah yeah you can have the whole\nback patio wherever you need and so\nimmediately was just jumped on board\nlast year uh he fed all our Racers for\njust a fraction of a cost like he\nliterally charged us cost for our pizzas\nthat we fed everybody on um so it's very\nsad to see but at the same time it's\nreally been great to see the community\nall come around him and everybody is\ntrying to help him out he'll be back we\nknow he'll be back yeah that's\nuh that is one of the things about um\nIowa and the Small Town Iowa and the\nkind of the\nfarm um\nmentality that even if you live in De Mo\nor Cedar Rapids one of the bigger towns\nyou still have the kind of the farm\nmentality\nwhere if somebody needs help you all\ncome together and you help We're All in\nThis Together yeah you know that's\nthat's what it is on gravel races too\nwhen you get into a nasty day like\nthat's before that day in 50s and\nraining I stood up in front of the\nracers and I was like you know what I\nlike just look around I like you all are\nin this together so help each other out\nif you see somebody on the side of the\nroad make sure they have what they need\nbecause it's nasty out there but these\nare the stories that get told for years\nto come the nice beautiful days yeah\nthey're great but at the same time those\naren't the stories that get told for\nyears so this is your story yep you're\nabsolutely correct so Redfield rock and\nroll\nSeptember you've got uh\n50k 100K 200k and 350k do you still have\nthat long one\nyep that's doing all three\nLoops\n350k\n180 plus\n3010 miles 210 ended up about 225 the\nlast two years 22 225\n16 16,000 feet of climb or so because\nit's flat yeah oh it's so\nflat our 100K is actually a full 65\nmiles in honor of one of Cole's good\nfriends who passed away a couple years\nago so there's always that the 100K ends\nup being 65 and I call it the Reynolds\n65 for my friend Ryan oh awesome passed\naway from cancer and so it's been cool\ncuz his family all shows up for the\nstart of the race and everything uh we\nhad his cousin lead everybody out on uh\nuh motocross bike his Ryan's number from\nthe time he was a little kid was\n65 and so uh I made it 65 and I always\ntell people it's like you get to ride a\ncouple extra miles for my buddy H that's\nI love that that's again that's a great\nstory it sucks we don't want to lose a\nfriend cancer but what a great way to\nhonor him he'd be I'm sure he smiles\nevery September he always got a kick out\nof my\nwriting we all do\nCole right Kelsey oh yes we all\ndo okay so you've been putting that\nthing on for five years you've got the\nIowa gravel project going along um and I\ndidn't talk about the Iowa gravel\nproject where you and I love this about\nit so I want to bring it up um you host\na weekly gravel ride that's open to all\ncomers and I know you alluded to other\ngroup rides\nthat I can say this like I grew up a\nroie I grew up you know fully shaved\nlegs like the only thing I carry on my\nbike was a a tube one tire lever and a\npump until CO2 cartridges were invented\nso now it's just a a blowy and a tube\nand yes I do have a tube we've talked\nabout that before um and uh a tire lever\nI don't have all kinds of stuff I don't\nlike I mean I've got skinny little tires\nI'm a ro at heart right that was my\nupbringing I love Mount biking I love\ngravel I love all of that but I grew up\na roie so I absolutely know the\npretentiousness I know the\nintimidation I'm like I've raced for 35\nyears and if I went down to well we're\ngoing to Austin Texas in a few weeks um\nif I joined the Tuesday night group ride\nthere I would be super intimidated to\nlike roll into that\ngroup and I feel like that is not a\nunique feeling in the world of Road and\nso\nhow are you going to get new people how\nare you going to get newcomers to to\njoin this what's intimidating for a 35y\nyear veteran bike\nracer uh to join into and I feel like\nwhat you guys are doing with the Iowa\ngravel project is exactly that you're\nunim non-intimidating you're open you're\nwelcoming you're\nencouraging to all comers so\ngosh there we just nailed your Tuesday\nnight ride\nright tell me about your ride the ride\nwas meant uh as an extension of the Iowa\ngravel project Facebook group uh it was\nit's one where in before we start each\nweek I tell people it's like you know\nlike we have a big\ngroup I don't even know all the people\nthat are here and so if you're end up\nwriting next to somebody like introduce\nyourself like just we're all good\nfriends in all reality we just don't\nknow it yet but like introduce yourself\nyou know see who that person is in all\nreality you might have had an\ninteraction with them online or\nsomething and know who they are know the\nname but you don't actually know that\nperson and that's that's one thing that\nalways warms my heart in the middle of\nthe ride or at the end of the ride uh is\nhearing that happening behind me you\nknow but I wanted it to be a more social\nride not a as I say rip your legs off\nride uh I try to tell people you\nknow basically you want to be at a\nconversation Pace if you can't have a\nconversation you're either in the wrong\ngroup or we're going too fast\nso uh I will say our long group does get\na little spicy sometimes s but ends up\neverybody can kind of hang and everybody\nwants to go fast so we go fast but it's\nmeant as a social ride and then\nafterwards we always hang out at\nsomewhere to have drinks or food or\neverything else you know and that's been\none of the cool things to see over the\nlast two years of it going into our\nthird season now is that that social\naspect has come out in the ride so much\nto the point where it's a regular\nregular occurrence for people that can't\nmake the ride to make the hangout either\nbefore or after the ride like they make\nsure they come and you know they just\nwant to hang out with everybody and it's\nlike well I can't do the ride tonight\nbut I can make it for\nthat so it's always it's so cool to see\nthat happening and it it's forming\nanother Community essentially you know\nyeah and I think one one of the things\nthat again we have listeners all over uh\nuh it's a great model anywhere in\nthe well in the world really but to just\nto have a get together a\nseveral um Paces several diff distances\nand I'll meet up and socialize and have\nsome uh food and beverage when the ride\nis over I think that's a great model for\nanyone and you laughed that like um you\nknow introduce yourself we're all\nyou know from the road like I'll ride\nwith somebody for two years and not know\ntheir name but I know what kind of bike\noh it's the dude on the red specialized\noh yeah I know who I know that guy I\nknow that guy by his bike I have no idea\nwhat his name is so well that's I'll say\nto the people is like you know often\ntimes you do recognize that person next\nto you but in all reality all you've\ndone is breathe really heavy in their\nsame space a few minutes at a time at a\nrace right you know you don't actually\nknow them yep yep that's exactly it so I\nlove that I love the social aspect of\nthat well that's we too we have the you\nknow we have two groups usually we have\nhave a fast group and a short group and\nthe short group is by no means supposed\nto be slow but it is welcome to you know\neverybody who hey I'm just getting out\non my gravel bike hey I got a gravel\nbike I want to come and see what this\nthing all about and you know some nights\nwe break it up into smaller groups even\nthen on the short groups so that we have\na new group or a experienced group or\npeople that help along it's been amazing\nhow many like literally brand new this\nis my first time I've ever ridden gravel\npeople that have come out to the ride\nand so it's it's really cool to see that\nand like\nhere kind of what I was hoping for when\nI thought about it actually happening is\npeople are like well I bought this\ntravel bike but all my friends just do\nragb and just do Road or just do casual\nrides or just do drinking rides and I\ndon't really have anybody to go with so\nI don't want to go by myself so I saw\nthis group and I I I showed up so it's\nit's really cool to hear all the stories\nof how people heard and stuff you know\nyep yep that's awesome I love that so\nthat's got to keep you guys busy not to\nmention your like day\njobs um but then I see an announcement\nthis spring that uh or maybe it was\nWinter I would say winter\num that a couple\nof\nuh I don't know about longstanding but\nkind of longstanding gravel races are\nchanging hands and you guys have taken\nover the spotted horse Ultra and the\nIowa gravel\nclassic Kelsey again you said in your\npodcast putting on One race is\nhard how what what led you to take on\ntwo more existing races oh I feel like I\ncan make this comparison to the\nconversation we were talking about dogs\nearlier\num if you have one what what is one more\nif you know you know how to do one you\nknow how to take care of one adding one\nmore into the collection isn't really\ngoing to be that hard so what is two\nmore fair enough so it's not a\nmultiplication Factor really is it and\nin reality we have both been around um\nboth gravel Iowa gravel classic and\nspotted horse for many years at this\npoint and it just feels like another\nextension of our\nfamily awes ring what's that I've missed\nracing one of each\nexactly and I finally yeah I finally OPP\noh go go I've been at every single one\nexcept for the first spotted horse and\nlast year the Iowa gravel\nclassic wow what about you Kelsey I\nfinally finally raced spotted horse once\nSarah add of the 70 mile race 75 Mile\nand I uh unfortunately um didn't finish\nbut I finally raced it this year um but\nnow I'm never gonna do it\nagain that's a good way to get out of\nhaving to do it actually I said to Kent\nCarlson last week at serum like you\nalways look for a way out of serum but\nyou're always glad you end up there but\nuh you found a great way out of it so\nthat's the number one question you get\nas a race director are you going to race\ntoday why do you think I can race\ntoday right exactly so tell me about\neach one um let's start with the Iowa\ngravel classic which is in July so I'm\ngoing to go in order of that they are\nwithin the year uh what is the Iowa\ngravel classic and um and where is it\nand why should somebody be excited to do\nit so Iowa gravel classic is in a really\ncool place in Iowa it is at the white\nConservancy um just outside of\nRapids that's about hour west of De\nMoine so really great driving distance\nfrom the Metro it is um a beautiful uh\ncons uh Conservation Area that has\nwonderful\ncampsites um so many spaces they've got\nU disc golf mountain biking uh BMX\ncourse all kinds of things um so that's\na location but it so then we put on the\nIowa gravel we're going to put on the\nIowa gravel classic that'll have um what\nwas it the 100K and the\n200k 100K and 100 Mil yes there we\ngo um where's it start and finish\nbecause White Rock Conservancy is it's\nhuge 5,000 Acres it's huge so where do\nyou guys start and finish uh it's based\nout of the Starfield\nCampground um they White Rock is awesome\nto us they actually will be reserved\njust for Racers on Friday night uh the\nentire Campground so it it's a great\ntime uh honestly Kelsey and I we camp\nout there the entire weekend every year\nuh we go out there on Friday set up camp\nand leave on Monday because it's always\non the week uh fourth July oh so we end\nup leaving on the Monday so we end up\nspending the entire weekend there uh\nrace I would race on Saturday and then\ni' we'd go do mountain biking and\neverything else on Sunday and just enjoy\nourselves out there uh it's it's kind of\na weird thing because it's it's far\nenough out away from City and\npopulation that even on Fourth of July\nweekend it's not p\nat all so it's really cool place to go\nfor a race and then spend the entire\nweekend\nthere that's cool and it's called the\nStarfield Campground it's wild that I\ndon't know I think it's like an hour 20\nfrom De Moine so the largest met\nmetropolitan area in the state I mean\nit's still Iowa but you know what I mean\nand it is a designated dark sky so the\nstars must be glorious oh they're so\ngorgeous absolutely breathtaking out\nthere that you can see for\ndays yeah that's\nawesome uh Iowa gravel classic in July\ndoes it have its own do each of these\nhave their own website or does everyone\ngo to one spot to find information on\nall of them we're working on getting uh\nour Iowa gravel project side up and\ngoing again um um we do have uh I gravel\nclassic has its own web page and also\nthe spoted horse gravel alra has its own\nweb page which I'm working on getting\nupdated right\nnow fair enough fair enough so you are\nhaving\n2024 yes I I I'm learning how to update\nwebsites so I am not a tech person and\nthis is I'm on my first computer I've\never bought at 40 years old right now oh\nwow boy there's a story there um all\nright so Iowa gravel classic if you\nGoogle that you'll uh hit the website\nand I'll put a link in the show notes\nfor sure uh and then the spotted horse\nUltra which I think has a cool name uh\nbut in the name is the word\nUltra uh what are the distances of the\nspotted horse Ultra when is it and where\nis it that's a lot of questions I just\nuh shot it at you guys\nbut um if you need a reminder I kind of\nremember what I asked so so the spot\nhorse Ultra uh it originally started\nwith a 200\nMiler well then uh this was started by\nSarah Cooper and then they added on a\ncouple others to end up being uh\nRelentless events eventually but it was\nstarted out in\nyeah cuz I did 17 so\nand it was a 200 mile but then\npeople I I don't want to say complained\nbut that's the best word for it is like\ncomplained that they wanted a distance\nthat they could finish they didn't feel\nlike they could finish the 200 and so\njokingly uh Sarah Cooper says well I'll\nadd a 150 then a Sprint\nand so that was the Sprint distance uh\nthis year in in recent years uh there's\nbeen added some shorter distances and\nstuff to make it a little more\naccessible to people that want to get a\nlittle taste of spotted horse rather\nthan the whole thing uh so this year we\nwill be\nhaving around a 35 mile ride for the\nshortest that'll be just a fun ride no\ntiming or anything but you'll get a\ntaste of what everybody else\ndoes um then the\n75 will be your next distance and then\nthe 150 and the\n200 uh the 150 and 200 I'm I wanted to\nkeep some of the original idea that\nSarah had to where essentially your uh\nfirst 80 to 100 miles is mirrored\nbetween the two routes and then at that\npoint you can choose if you if you\nregistered for the 150 and you feel you\ngot it in your legs Go For It Go for the\n200 you know it's not a big deal it's\nyou know just go for it because it's\nit's encouraging people to get outside\ntheir comfort zone to go further and hey\nif you feel you got it go for it so\nthat's kind of a unique thing to this\nevent I haven't really come across too\nmany events that are like that um but\nthis\nyear this is the first actual Public\nPublic Announcement it's on bike Iowa on\nour uh on our event page and stuff where\nit's located we are changing the\nlocation from the previous years uh the\nlast handful of years it's been at the\nMadison County winery which is awesome\nawesome place it's been an absolutely\namazing\nvenue the the view is just breathtaking\nthere uh but one of the things is that\nit's on pavement and it's a pretty\nSpeedy Highway at that point and lots of\nline curves and everything else and you\nstart and finish on that pavement so\nwe're actually moving it only 5 miles\nuh we're actually moving it straight on\nto gravel to the uh big rack brew house\nso it's the big\nRy um it's when I talked to Aaron uh the\nowner I was like hey you and I have been\ntalking about throwing an event at your\nplace for a couple years now in some\nform or\nanother would you like to do spotted\nhorse and he literally said f\nyes\nthat's awesome so he was more than happy\nto have us uh that way now we'll be\nstarting and finishing on the\ngravel uh be ready for a finishing Hill\nI will say\nthat if it was decided by then it will\nbe decided at the\nend so I feel like it's fair to tell\npeople that the finish line is at the\ntop of a hill when they come to that 152\n200 M split and they're thinking maybe\nI'll do 200 miles oh wait I got to get\nup a hill at the Finish Line well so\nkeep a little bit in the tank right I\nmean always had a evil finishing Hill\nfair enough fair enough well and also I\nmean you have non-stop Hills the entire\nway because that's the area that you're\ngoing through for the course is you just\nhave non-stop Iowa rollers and Iowa\nrollers aren't like other states rollers\nlike you have uh I feel like gravel\nworlds out in Nebraska they have true\nrollers like you are as they say sailing\nthe Seas of gravel because it is these\nnice five to six% grades you'll have a\ncouple they'll get to seven to eight but\nthe area that we go through you have\nIowa rollers and those are 8 to 12 to\n15 so\npercent grade so you'll know what I mean\nwhen I say that when you hit\nthem so uh we've all heard the term\ngravel grinder you will definitely be\ngrinding up the gravel on some of those\nsteep\nones but that's the thing it's supposed\nto be a hard event it's that's what it\nis and it doesn't matter if you come out\nand do our fun ride to our longest route\nit's it's going to be difficult but\nthat's what it's meant to\nbe yep you guys got to be exhausted at\nthe end of a weekend of\nthat\nyes fair enough fair enough at least I\ndid ask a yes no question so we have\ncamping at all of them so at least at\nthe end of the Finish Line we just have\nto roll into our 10 at the end of the\nnight uh camping at uh the end of both\nwell Iowa gravel classic at the\nStarfield Campground and spotted horse\nis his there we have around 90 Acres\nthat we're going to be on so we all\nkinds of room uh Aaron the owner he's\nalready I believe he says he has uh five\nRV sites with uh Electric hookup and\neverything uh already and plenty of tent\ncamping wherever you want to go so it's\nit'll be nice because then we'll also\nlike they'll be open the whole time\nthrough the Finish Lines and everything\nso when you get done there will end up\nbeing some food there there'll be some\nbeer if you want you know there will be\na chair for you\nsomewhere uh sounds like it might be a\nspot for music probably so just saying\njust saying there there already is music\nplanned aon's already looking at bands\nall right awesome awesome I didn't want\nto assume that but uh I'm glad to to\nhear that sounds like an awesome venue\nand uh it's at a brewery and like I love\nbeer do you get your own beer at this do\nyou get your own like is there a spotted\nhorse Ale on in the\nworks uh I haven't talked to him about\nit yet but I don't think it would uh be\ntwisting his arm much I think you need\nto talk to him about that for\nsure all right and what's the date of\nthat that is October 19th October 19th\nso we've\ngot the Iowa gravel classic in July July\n4th weekend Saturday before July 4th is\nthat a safe\nassumption yep or no it's after six this\nyear yeah July 6th okay July 6th then\nRedfield rock and roll in September\nwhat's the date of\nthat think it's I have too many dates\nnow I think it's September 6th when you\njust had one race Kelsey September 7th\nyou could September 7th yeah when you\njust had one race Kelsey you could\nremember September and now you have all\nthese children and you can't remember\ntheir\n[Laughter]\nnames well that's why it's left to us\nwith no children so these are children\nfair enough fair enough um these are\nyour children for sure or your dogs as\nwe talked

There is still plenty to do!\nOct 3 -\n- Buffalo 105 in Newton\n- Snaggy Ridge 105 in Tipton\n- Volga City Gravel Race in Volga\n- RAGBRAI Roadshow - High Trestle Trail in Slater\n- CITA Dirty Duathlon *CANCELED*\n- Ride Across Iowa in a Day (RAID) *CANCELED*\nOct 9\n- Jingle Cross Festival & UCI World Cup *CANCELED*\nOct 10\n- RAGBRAI Roadshow - Great Western Trail in Cumming\nOct 17\nJoe Mann Memorial Ride in Muscatine\nFatober Fat & Mountain Bike Trail Ride in Osage\nRAGBRAI Roadshow - Neal Smith Trail in Des Moines\nICGravel **canceled**\nOct 24\nSpotted Horse Gravel Ultra - 2020 in St. Charles\n\nThanks to all the event coordinators period. We know it has been a tough decision to still hold your event let alone attend one in this strange year.  If you cancelled, we know that decision was tough too and if you chose to still have your event, we know that is stressful and we support you too.\n\n#3) State and County Parks\nScott loves staycations. State Parks are a perfect place to get away from it all and not travel too much. You’ll be amazed at the varying terrain and topography that Iowa has to offer.\n\nLast week we took a 4 day weekend in NE Iowa and camped, rode, hiked and found some gnarly gravel roads and scenic byways to drive on including the Great River Road along the Mississippi including a @cCassville Car Ferry ride across the river.\n\nFind a state park at https://www.iowadnr.gov/Places-to-Go/State-Parks/Iowa-State-Parks\nAnd county parks  at https://www.mycountyparks.com\n\n#4) RIP - Paul Black\nOn Sept 23rd, a pillar in the Central Iowa cycling community - Paul Black was in his mid-70's and had done about every type of endurance race out there. Scott gives some highlights of Paul's racing pedigree an talks about his LIFE Experiences on a bicycle. \n\nHere are 4 memorable quotes about Paul\nKyle Robinson said \"Heaven’s cycling team just received a ringer.\"\nSarah Cooper stated “Paul was having epic adventures and ultra racing long before it was cool, “\n@Patrick Coughlin said \"a lion in sheep's clothing\"\nHarry Fortney said \"Paul was one of the good guys. He would wait for you on group rides so he could tear your legs off again. He’d always help his teammates and others be better cyclists and people in general. He was a role model, always looking for his next adventure.\n\nNo word on Funeral arrangements yet. I assume it will be a family-only event with covid, but you can read the updates on https://caringbridge.org/visit/paulblack\n\nRIP Paul Black.\n\n#5) Pogie Lites\nAs the weather gets cooler, Scott mentions Pogie Lites - a product he created in 2018 after enduring a really rainy and cold 2017 race season. He got tired of cold wet hands and being on the verge of hypothermia so he made a few prototypes which lef to Pogie Lites which are a 4-season super-lite-weight, water-resistant, wind-proof pogie that keeps the wind, rain and muck off your hands.\nPogie Lites allow YOU to control the temperature of your hands.\n\nHow to get them?\nThey are $75 a pair and you can get them at\nhttps://pogielites.com\nWorld of Bikes in Iowa City and Beaverdale Bicycles in Des Moines both have a small supply\nGoldfinch Cyclery in Cedar Rapids will have a supply in a week,\nAs the old saying goes “There is no such thing as bad weather, only bad gear”\n\nTHAT’S IT FOR THIS WEEK ! You can find more information on all of these items by checking out BIKEIOWA.com.\n\nStarting in October, we’ll go from weekly posts to monthly posts. \nWe’ve had fun with these weekly Summer posts and plan to post weekly again next Spring.\n \nWe’ll let ya know a couple of days in advance when we’ll go LIVE so you can tune.  We’ll still add to YouTube and BIKEIOWA as a Review afterwards too so if you miss it, you can still watch it later.\n\nIf YOU have something you’ve like us to share on Friday Fives ping us on Facebook or email Biker@BIKEIOWA.com\n\nRIDE SAFE and Stay Healthy !",

weekend all the\nway up through uh through december\nhopefully things slow down a little bit\nuh number three\nstate and county parks so we've\nmentioned a little bit about this before\nbut yeah we love staycations and uh\nstate parks county parks are a perfect\nplace to get away from it all and not\ntravel too far\nyou'd be amazed at the varying terrain\nand topography that iowa has to offer\nso last week we took a four day weekend\nin northeast iowa\nwe camped we rode we hiked and we found\nsome gnarly gravel roads and scenic\nbyways to drive on\nincluding a bunch of miles on a great\nriver road along the mississippi\nhere just a real quick run down on the\ndifferent things that we did\nwe went to the yellow river state forest\nsuper tall trees lots of elevation\nchange rocky trails\nsummer hiking only some allow hiking\nbiking and horses\nuh we camp there too it's a great place\nwe could easily spend two or three days\nthere\nuh we hit backbone state park because\niowa's first state park\ngorgeous scenery there's some gnarly\ndirt trails\nuh rock grooty uh plenty of paved roads\nto ride on\nand a great place to camp uh even a\nbetter place to hike and check out\nthe true the backbone trail volga state\npark we only hiked there we\nspent just a couple hours in there but\ndefinitely want to go back and explore\nmore\necho valley was a smaller park we only\nhiked but found plenty to see along an\nold creek\nalong a creek and old bridges dams and\nccc buildings that were built back in i\nbelieve the 40s\nwe hiked at bellevue state park we hiked\nto the mines of spain\nrecreation area near dubuque we started\nat the deer creek campground in\ncharlotte iowa that's\nuh last year last week's friday fives we\nwere riding the turds and misery\nthe 200k route and that's what we did\nfrom charlotte\na pretty nice little uh campground there\nuh\ncheap full hookups so a tip if you get\nthe sherlock if the meat locker's open\nthey have\nexcellent meat sticks and we've bought\nsome bacon too which i'm assuming will\nbe just as tasty\nas the meat sticks oh we also camp 10\nfeet from the mississippi river\nand miller riverview park and campground\nin dubuque\nbut one of the most interesting\nactivities was not even bike related\ni was crossing the mississippi on the\ncassfield car\nferry we boarded the van on the iowa\nside near millville and got off\nat cassville wisconsin it's pretty much\nacross the river with a little bit of uh\ndownstream\nprobably i don't know maybe 20 minutes\non the on the water\nand then we found some scenic roads\nincluding some\ngravel on the wisconsin side and we went\nup through\nprairie du chien uh if you're interested\nin that ferry take a look at\ncassville.org ferry casco cass\nbill we'll post it on the on the notes\nuh the ferry closes on october 25th\nso get it in if you want some um the\nleaves are just starting to change what\nwe saw so hopefully the next\nweek or two uh definitely be changing so\nget some white can i we'll link the\nlinks for the state and county parks\non this review afterwards number four\nrest in peace paul black on wednesday\nour good friend paul black passed away\nfrom complications\nof pneumonia cancer and bouta leukemia\npaul was a pillar in the central iowa\ncycling community but was really known\nworldwide paul was super kind quiet\nsoft-spoken humble and methodical\nbut once you got him talking you know\nyou'd be in for a good detailed story\npaul was in his mid 70s and he\nidentified every type of endurance race\nout there\nhe was a long time mentor of the des\nmoines cycle club he crewed for others\non various races around the country\nand he could still peddle circles around\nmost of the fast folks\nwho are still in their 30s ball was a\nplayer in the endurance cycling scene\nsince the early 70s\nhis racing pedigree is impressive having\ncompeted several\nself-contained tours competing and\nwinning callous purveys\nwinning first place in the 550 mile race\nin ohio\nhe finished paris breast paris in 1991\nhe finished ram race across america in\nhe raced several i did a bike and i did\na bike extreme races from 1995 to 2000.\nso the identity stuff the the winter\nwinter racing is especially\nepic to me since way back that in 95 to\n2000 there were no fat bikes there were\nno fat bike tires\nand just think about how much better the\ngear and nutrition has gotten since then\nand paul was doing those back in 95 and\n2000 with\npretty much an oversized mountain bike\ntire\nand you know really kind of antiquated\ngear at this point in time\num i was excited when paul was our\nfeatured speaker at the fire trucker\nadventure bike talk in january 2019\nwe got to hear about his life experience\non a bicycle we got to see old slides we\ngot to see his old bicycles\nhe brought those in he only talked for\ntwo hours but i could uh\neasily listen for ten as as every one of\nhis stories was epic\nand had a had a good good storyline to\nit\nso i think if there's ever a person\nyou'd call a badass it'd be paul and if\ni said that to him right now\nhe'd just smile and shrug it off so this\nweek i was reading some quotes from some\nfriends\nuh who who wrote about paul and four of\nthese stuck in my mind\nnumber one is from kyle robinson he said\nheaven's cycling team just received a\nringer\nsarah cooper said paul was having epic\nadventures and alter racing long before\nit was cool\npat coughlin said a lion in sheep's\nclothing\nharry fourtney said paul was one of the\ngood guys he'd wait for you on a group\nride\nso he could tear your legs off again he\nalways helped his teammates and others\nto be better cyclists and better people\nin general\nhe was a role model always looking for\nhis next adventure so there's no word on\nfuneral arrangements yet i assume it'll\nbe a family-only event but with covid\nyou know with kobe going on but you\ncould read the updates on caringbridge\nwe'll post a link in this review\nso rest in peace paul you're a good\nfriend\nnumber five pokey lights\nso i just kind of want to mention this\nas the weather gets cooler uh this is a\nproduct i created in 2018 after enduring\na really rainy and cold\n2017 where six of my main events uh six\nout of 11 of my main events were in\ninclement weather\ni just got tired of the cold hands and\nbeing on the verge of hypothermia at the\nend of some of these races and i knew\nthere had to be something better\nand they've actually got pretty popular\nin the last couple years i just kind of\nwant to explain what they are if you're\nnot familiar with it\nso first of all what are they well\nthey're a four season super lightweight\nwater resistant windproof\npogey that keeps the wind and rain and\nmuck off your hands\nso if you don't really know what is a\npogi\nso if you're familiar with bar mitz\nthose are a style of pogey\nthey're more common in the atv and\nsnowmobile industry where they fit over\nthe handlebars\nto shield your hands from the elements\nmost of those\nare used in cold weather races and rides\nlike i did ride in alaska\nand thirdly why do why do i call them\npogi lights well normally pogies are\npretty big\nbulky they're insulated but pokey lights\nare single wall they're really flexible\nuh they're only three ounces and before\nwould fold it up they take about as much\nroom as\na the space of a beer can they can also\nbe folded up on your bars\nstuffed in a jersey park pocket or a\nbike bag when not needed\nuh this is where the lights in pokey\nlights comes in\nso these are the pokey lights\nhopefully you can see those but really\nyou stick your stick your hands in you\nstick them on your bar with\nstraight bar down bar jones bar anything\nlike that\nyou cinch them up on this side you can\ncinch them up a little bit here\nbut really they're they are just a a\nthey create an air pocket with your with\nyour hands around your handlebars\nthey keep the wind out um some of the\nmuddy races it doesn't get up all over\nyour hands all your on your controls\nuh we make these um they're made about\n10 feet to my right jess is the sewer\nand i'm the assembler\nand as simple as they are they they do\nmake some they do take some time to make\nyou know i'm sure we could say hey i\nwant a thousand of these made in china\nand get them get them right away but\nuh if you guys know me that's not me we\nlike to source local and\nthrough the us when we can uh we are\ndefinitely the definition of small batch\nso why do they work so well it's as i\nmentioned it's the air pocket created by\nby the windproof rip stop material to\nkeep your hands warm\npokey likes allows you to keep control\nover the temperature on your hands\nso most people when their hands get cold\noutside they'll get cold because they're\nsweating inside their gloves\nand once this happens you're done so\nmost folks overdress\nby wearing too heavy of a glove or using\na big ass pogie\nwhere there's only one position for your\nhand to go and that's inside the pogie\nno matter how hot you get uh you really\ncan't take them outside the pogie\nand and have any control of your bike\nwell the pogi lights are human here's a\nhere's a pair right\nso that's them folded up um\noutside like a size of beer kang goes to\njersey pocket what have you\nthese you can shift you can steer you\ncan break over the top whether or not\nyou're in\nstraight bars drop bars or jones bars\nand it allows you all your handlebar\npositions so you can ride the drops you\ncan ride in the hoods\nyou can ride on the straights different\nspots and\nyou're not you're not you're not locked\ninto into one position\nso as your hands get hot you can feel\nthat you take them out of the pogies\nyou put them on top of your handlebars\nyou're right like that for a while until\nthey get cool again\nso it's really an experience of of you\ncontrolling where\nyour hands are when you're riding you\ncan also roll them back\non your bars you can also roll them back\non your hands so maybe just your\nfingertips you know\nkind of chilly i'll rest your hand your\nwrist is not\nyou can kind of roll it back up until\nthat up until that point\num and it took a while to for me to\nfigure that out when i first created\nthey were either on or off but as you\nride with them\nyou realize you can't control the\ntemperature even more\nby rolling them back and using the\nability to get in and out\nwould i take them on a negative 30\ndegree trip in alaska yeah probably not\nthey're not that heavy of a pogi but i\nhave used them countless times in single\ndigit temperatures with lightweight\ngloves\nand still don't have any issues and i\nreally don't have that good of a\ncirculation in my hands anyway so i do\nget cold quickly\nthe only time i push the limits was last\njanuary at the triple d\nwhen it's a 65 mile fat bike race i knew\nit was gonna be cold that day but i\nwanted to try them out\nuh the race attempts to drop from they\nstart we started in 30 degrees and 20\nmile an hour winds\nat and we ended with 30 mile an hour\nwinds\nsix degrees and we had 50 mile an hour\ngusts and i made the temp\nuh windshield negative 17 degrees that's\nthe only time when i kind of felt like i\nwas i was pushed into the limits\nand really my my face uh little bits of\nmy face and my feet were probably colder\nmy hands were\nuh there's only one person who finished\nthat race uh that year and it was not me\nso they're not pokey lights aren't just\nfor winter riding either i use them\nthis august in montana when i had a cool\nwindy\nrainy morning and i used them several\ntimes this summer when there was just a\nrain drizzle or a rainstorm and i just\nhappened to get\ncaught in it or actually left in the\nrain but i always pretty much keep them\npacked with me\nthey're popular with the community folks\ntoo where you never know where the wind\nwill be like or the chill in the morning\nor\nlate evening after you get off of work\nand you don't want to carry another set\nof gloves or\na full-sized pogi they're the only pokey\non the market that works with straight\nbars drop bars flared bars\nor even jones bars and they slip over\nthe controls of pretty much every bike\ni've tested them on\num i also wanted to mention that the\npogey likes you know they aren't the\nmagic bullet for everybody\nif you're riding really slow and very\ncold temps and not building up any body\nheat\nprobably won't be very happy with the\npokey lights um\nyou gotta actually be be rolling being\nup keeping up your body heat\nin order for the pogi lights to build up\nthat warm air pocket\nuh they're very versatile and it has\ndefinitely changed my inclement\nwriting abilities so\num we've had several people test these\nover the years\nwe've had fatbike.com writinggravel.com\nthey've tested them\nposted positive reviews andrea cohen\ntook them on the\ntour divide route in 2018. i took them\nand basically everything i was doing\non 2018. they worked great uh to date i\nthink we sold\nover 40 states in five countries and\nthis morning we just sent a pair\nto boise idaho so\nhow do you get them well they're seventy\nfive dollars a pair on the bike iowa\nstore by cowboycott.com\nshop world of bikes in iowa city\nand beaverdale bicycles in iowa or\nexcuse me beaverdale bicycles in des\nmoines they both have a small supply\ngoldfinch cycler and cedar rapids will\nhave a supply\nin probably not this week but next week\nand i just want to kind of mention\nthough this wasn't really a sales pitch\ni'm just telling you a story about\nhow a product derived through writing\nand it just as the old saying goes\nthere's no such thing as bad weather\nonly bad gear so that's it for this week\ni just uh wanted to also note that\nwe've done this every friday through the\nsummer and starting next week we're\ngoing to start doing this once a month\nso we're going to do it just in october\nsometime\nwe don't know if it's going to be the\nfirst friday the second friday third\nfriday kind of depends on how things\nwork out\nwe'll let you know a few days in advance\nbefore we go live so you can tune in\nand of course you'll still be able to\nwatch it uh via youtube\non bike i reviews afterwards um\nand if there's something you want us to\nshare on our friday fives\nping us on facebook or email by here at\nbikeiva.com\nthank you right safe and stay healthy",
