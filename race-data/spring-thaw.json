      "length": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "50 miles sits awkwardly between casual and serious distances.

More compact than Grinduro."

      "technicality": {
        "score": 2,

      "elevation": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "2000 feet over 50 miles is gentle rolling - 40 feet per mile average. Michigan doesn't offer massive climbs, so this fits the geography. Enough to feel it in your legs but won't destroy anyone accustomed to actual hills. Less climbing than The Mid South."
      },
      "climate": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Spring conditions create variable weather challenges. Pittsburgh's event had \"parts of the course were more windy than others\" with \"one weird spot where it was always drizzling.\" Ohio's 2025 edition started with \"rainy conditions\" requiring shelter time. More weather exposure than Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."
      },
      "altitude": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Lake Michigan proximity means sea-level racing with zero altitude considerations. No acclimatization needed - fitness translates directly to performance without elevation variables affecting pacing or recovery strategies. Lower altitude than Gravel Worlds — no thin-air concerns."

      "adventure": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Michigan gravel offers modest adventure potential with forest roads and lake country scenery. 50 miles provides enough distance for some solitude and suffering. The real adventure here is trying to locate an event that doesn't appear in any official results or registrations."
      },
      "prestige": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "The \"10th Annual Great Big Spring Thaw Ride\" drew \"25+ show up for a rainy start\" with local sponsor support from Brioso Coffee and The Bread Pirate Roberts. Kenda surprised participants with free tires or tubes, reflecting grassroots community character over prestige branding."
      },
      "race_quality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Organization varies with some operational gaps. Pittsburgh lacked proper pace groups - \"There was no 10:30 pacer, so a bunch of us put ourselves between 10 and 11.\" However, volunteer support and post-race amenities provide adequate infrastructure."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 2,

      },
      "community": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Muskegon cycling community exists and is reasonably active, though nothing like the established scenes in Grand Rapids or Ann Arbor. Michigan gravel riders are generally solid people who show up and suffer together. The challenge is finding this actual event to participate with them."
      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "With a field of 100-200 riders, no field data exists because no confirmed race exists. Michigan has strong gravel talent that migrates to known events like Barry-Roubaix and Iceman, but they're not showing up to phantom races. Expect small local turnout at best. Thinner field than Ouray Gravel Grinder."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "If this race actually exists, Michigan events typically offer solid value with reasonable entry fees and decent post-race spreads. The region doesn't gouge like Colorado or California events. Problem is paying for something that might not be real."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Registration runs $50-75. Organizers provided waterproof route maps and Kenda contributed tires or tubes to participants, reducing rider equipment costs. The community sponsor involvement from local businesses like Brioso Coffee suggests reasonable regional pricing without resort town premiums. Similar expense level to Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

Michigan had record level snow fall this past winter, and as the snow melts and spring rains start the saturated ground can't hold any more. Water levels are reaching some of the highest in local residents' memory, and possibly in recorded history. \n\nDonate to The REAL United States Video Blog: \nhttps://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=VFFB7P269QV3N\n\nStay connected!\nFacebook Page: http://www.facebook.com/RealUnitedStates\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/REALUSvlog\nGoogle+ https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/112052358926074194091/112052358926074194091/posts\nText updates on your mobile phone: http://motube.us/realunitedstatesvlog\nWebsite: http://www.realunitedstaes.com\nSee (most) all video locations marked on Google Maps: http://bit.ly/VzTI9k\n\nEXACT LOCATION of video:\nLatitude: 43.89544\nLongitude: -85.25925",

          "transcript": "hello ladies and gentlemen Welcome to\nthe Real United States video blog I'm\nyour host Paul Campbell and as always\nbehind the camera is my wife and our\ncamera operator Beverly Campbell we're\nhere in Evert Michigan on the banks of\nthe mosan river now some of you may have\nseen our episode about a week ago where\nwe were talking about the spring ice\nmelt here along the mosan river we were\nhoping at that time it was going to be\nslow enough that we weren't going to get\nany flooding but we weren't so lucky as\nit turns out we are having historic\nwater levels along the mosan river and\nthere is a lot of flooding just starting\nto happen to people you can see behind\nme here that the water is literally up\nto the bottom of the bridge there are\ncurrently concerns that this bridge may\nactually get washed out in a minute\nwe're going to swing around the other\nside of the bridge and show you the\nwater coming down against the bridge on\nthe Upstream side but I wanted to start\nhere by showing you just how bad the\nwater levels\nwere uh we spoke just uh briefly with a\ngentleman who lives just across Ross the\nriver who wasn't eager to appear on\ncamera but was very kind and his home\nwe're going to swing around and show you\non the far side of the river is in fact\nflooded\nnow it's the place on the far side of\nthe\nriver there's an American flag flying\nout there and you can see that the water\nis up into his home\nalready they're expecting water levels\nto be as high as in places as 13 ft\nabove normal levels we're hoping that it\ndoesn't get any worse than it is now\nwe'd certainly like like to see these\nfolks not have any more damage happen\nthan already has now there was some\nwarning that the flooding was coming but\nnot a great deal so people made what\npreparations they could one of the\nunfortunate things is that a dam\nUpstream has busted releasing a large\namount of water all at once into the\nmosan and so that's exacerbating the\nproblem along here with the flooding so\nnow let's take a walk over to the\nUpstream side of the the bridge and show\nyou what's going on over\nthere well folks as you can see here the\nwater level's high it's spilled up all\nalong through here up into people's\nyards they're you can see where the\nfence here is only partially sticking\nout of the water that this is normally a\npark further out in the distance that's\nall underwater there's a a trash can you\ncan see that's well back from the bank\nof the river that's only sticking about\nhalfway out of the\nwater so the water is quite\nhigh now we're going to try and get a\nshot there's not a real clear view here\nthe upside of the\nbridge but Beverly if you'll come down\nhere where I'm standing I think you can\nshow everybody the water actually\nroiling up against the Upstream side of\nthe bridge there's some trees and debris\nthat have also caught against the bridge\nthat the water's pushing\nagainst now I know that we like to make\nan issue on this channel that there's no\nhype no script no net so I'm not trying\nto hype this or use any particular\njargon to make it seem more spectacular\nthan it is it's not spectacular It's\njust sad but it is what's going on here\nin the United States it's part of real\nlife like so many places in the world\nbut you don't hear about small\ncommunities like Evert when they have\nflooding you hear about big disasters on\nthe international news of course when\nthe Mississippi floods or the Ohio River\nor one of the larger river floods and\naffects many many people but a lot of\nsmall towns small communities rural\nareas that are along waterfronts due\nthis time of Year's flood with the\nhistoric snowfalls we've had it's not\nsurprising that we were going to have\nflooding I think any everybody sort of\nanticipated\nit so I'm certainly not trying to\nhyperbolize any of this but I did want\nto share it with\nyou and you can see on the far side of\nthe river here where the waterers\nover into this property\nwhich is normally several feet\nabove the water\nlevel and in fact a friend of mine\nhappens to live just over there I'm\ngoing to have to speak with him later\ntoday and see if in fact his home has\nbeen flooded I know that he was flooded\nlast year and the water levels seem\nhigher this year than they were last so\nI'm I'm concerned about my friend's\nwelfare and that was one of the reasons\nwe wanted to come to\nwas to check out the situation here I\nhaven't seen him in a couple of days so\nI'll see him this afternoon and find out\nif he's\nokay okay we've moved Downstream along\nthe mosan River from where we were in\ndowntown\nEvert to a place\nabout mile and a half\nSouth and you can see that this road is\ncompletely flooded out now this is a\ndead end road that goes up to the mosan\nriver but you can see the road sign off\nin the distance about 100 yard or 100 m\noff behind me sitting in the water and\nthis entire area has been\nflooded now I don't see any homes in\nthis area the homes are built further\nback up on a little bit higher ground\nfortunately so people have been aware\nthat this is a flood plane in their\nplanting and that's a good thing but you\ncan\nsee off in the distance maybe that the\nMuskegan river is really really flowing\nhard and that there's flooding even on\nthe far side of the river I imagine from\nthis video it's hard to tell where the\nriverbed itself\nis but it's probably about 50 ft beyond\nthat stop sign or that road end sign is\nwhere the beginning of the riverbed\nis and it extends to the tree line on\nthe far side\nnow this is all private property you can\nsee there's actually no trespassing\nposted signs all along here\nto keep people from trespassing on the\nowner's property but this is completely\nunderwater\nnow it almost looks if you can see\nbetween the trees as though there's a a\nsecond rivered which is not actually a\nriverbed this is just the water flowing\naround a little higher area in the\nground and in fact that water is is\nreally moving along I can't tell exactly\nhow fast but it might be moving along at\nas much as 8 or 10\nknots and considering this is not a\nterribly hilly area that's a fairly\nquick pace for this River\nnow you can see here folks that the the\nwater is actually moving fast enough\nover the road that it's carrying\nsediment Downstream I don't know how\nmuch of that's going to actually get\ncarried along but you can see that here\non the road that it's actually washed\noff a lot of the sand out of the just\nleft the stone in the gravel and then\nhere along the edge you can see a little\nrivulet of sand from the water just\ncarrying all the Earth and all the soil\nand everything Downstream that's\ncertainly not good for anyone that has\nFarmland that's on a flood plane because\nthat'll take all of the nutrients out of\nthe soil so this is definitely a good\nstrong current that's coming along\nhere we'll keep you updated if there's\nany uh developments changes if this\nbridge washes out we're going to try and\nkeep an eye on this over the next couple\nof days so I'd like to thank you for\njoining us here the real United States\nvideo blog if you haven't already we\nencourage you to pick subscribe and join\nus for future episodes if you have\nquestions or comments please leave them\nin the comments section below we try to\nget back to everybody we can as soon as\nwe possibly can and as always thank you\nfor watching",
