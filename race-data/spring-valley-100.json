        "explanation": "One hundred miles delivers serious gravel challenge, as Gerasimos G. discovered when the lead group held \"about 20mph average with some tailwind\" early before conditions forced conservative pacing. The distance separates casual riders from committed ones, with the 60-mile option keeping recreational participants engaged while the full century provides the suffering gravel racers seek."

        "explanation": "Race organizers describe \"45 mph downhills on two wheels over misshapen marbles\" after graders fluff up the gravel, creating fast but technical descents. The Driftless Region terrain follows a predictable pattern: \"downhill, valley, river, bridge, then uphill, open rolling plateau of farmland\" according to competitive rider reports, requiring handling skills but not rock garden expertise."

        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Four thousand feet includes the notorious \"soul-breaking Oriole Road at mile 91\" that hits when riders are already depleted.

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Weather extremes define this race, from 2021's brutal 94°F heat that caused half the registered field to skip, to historical variance \"from the 30s to the 80s, cold rain to hot sun.\" Gerasimos G. noted ideal 2018 conditions allowed PR times around 6:18, but spring racing in Minnesota means preparing \"in fear\" of conditions that rarely cooperate."
      },
      "altitude": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Southeastern Minnesota sits barely above sea level in the Root River valley system.

      },
      "adventure": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Self-supported racing through Bluff Country USA offers exploration of Minnesota's most interesting terrain, enhanced by the 2025 route addition of Forestville State Historic Site after a new footbridge reopened access. The consistent valley-to-plateau pattern provides scenic variety, though sixteen years on the same basic route reduces the exploration factor considerably."
      },
      "prestige": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Spring Valley 100 operates as grassroots racing with zero prize purse and finishes at a frisbee golf course. Connection to nearby La Crescent Gravel National Championships provides some regional relevance as preparatory training, but this remains local Minnesota cycling rather than destination racing that draws notable competitors or national attention."
      },
      "race_quality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Self-supported format means minimal race production beyond route marking, though volunteers at Preston (mile 40) provided water truck support and \"pickles wrapped in salami.\" Gerasimos G.'s navigation struggles when the field spread out reveal organizational gaps, but sixteen years of operation suggests basic competency even if the experience feels bare-bones compared to premium gravel events."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Rolling through the distinctive Driftless Region with its repeating pattern of river valleys and farmland plateaus provides scenic variety, enhanced by the covered forest coolness before each bridge crossing. The \"soul-breaking Oriole Road at mile 91\" delivers memorable late-race suffering, though finishing at Willow Park's frisbee golf course deflates any epic conclusion."
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "\"Barrier-free\" racing attracts Minnesota cyclists with pre-race \"electrifying\" atmosphere in the grassy lot and \"nervous bantering\" among riders wearing CRo-designed kits from regional events. Connection to Gravel 'Sota series and local sponsors like Lupulin Brewing shows regional support, but the community remains distinctly local rather than drawing broader gravel racing participation."
      },

        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Field size remains undisclosed, though 2021's extreme conditions saw only 150 of 350 registered riders start, with maybe \"15 riders\" in the opening lead group before early splits. No notable competitive results emerge from sixteen years of racing, and Gerasimos G.'s detailed race reports suggest participation cycling rather than serious competitive depth."

Four thousand feet of climbing and sixteen years of route refinement provide honest gravel challenge without premium event markup, making it accessible Minnesota racing with solid value proposition."

      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Spring Valley, Minnesota keeps lodging and dining costs reasonable compared to destination gravel hubs. Minimal entry fees (\"free to public\" in some years, $35 recently) eliminate the biggest race expense, and driving accessibility means avoiding flight costs to reach more expensive Western gravel destinations while still accessing quality Driftless Region terrain."
