Virtually no flat or straight sections\" over the full 100-mile distance. Longer than Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

      "technicality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "JOM discovered \"Alabama gravel is the real deal. Not pea-sized gravel, but more like chunky rocks in the trickier spots.\" The course mixes red-clay Alabama dirt with \"some chunk, some smooth, and some unmaintained county pavement\" according to organizers, but avoids technical mountain bike features in favor of sustained gravel grinding. Less technical than The Mid South."
      },
      "elevation": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "K-Dogg described \"one excessively hilly section\" where single speed riders had to \"attack over and over again\" to maintain momentum with their fixed gearing. The 4000 feet comes as rolling Alabama terrain rather than sustained climbs, with organizers noting \"rolling hills\" throughout Chambers County's rural roads. Less climbing than The Mid South."
      },
      "climate": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Early November timing avoids Alabama's brutal summer heat, but dust becomes a major factor. K-Dogg observed that \"everybody's faces were smeared with so much red dust they looked like irradiated Native Americans.\" JOM noted the \"fine red dust\" during pre-ride reconnaissance, and organizers warn that \"if it rains, it will be muddy.\" More weather exposure than Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."
      },
      "altitude": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Waverly sits at typical Alabama elevations around 600-800 feet above sea level, making altitude a complete non-factor. The rural Chambers County terrain stays consistently low throughout the route, so sea level riders face no respiratory challenges and mountain dwellers get no meaningful advantage from thinner air. Lower altitude than Gravel Worlds — no thin-air concerns."
      },
      "adventure": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "JOM described riding \"through a cemetery\" and encountering \"a horribly washboarded dirt and gravel road\" on course. The race explores Chambers County's remote red-clay roads ending at the actual Standard Deluxe roadhouse in tiny Waverly (population 100), offering authentic rural Alabama gravel culture most riders will never otherwise experience."
      },

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Growing from 75 riders in 2016 to a 225-rider cap by 2025, the Standard Deluxe remains regionally focused without national recognition. Elite riders like JOM and K-Dogg provide race reports, but the event stays true to organizers' philosophy: \"We designed this for fun, not for profit\" with no prize purse or pro field development."
      },
      "race_quality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "The organizers clearly care - they cap registration for 'best experience' and throw an afterparty at the actual Standard Deluxe. But the complete absence of course details, aid station info, or even a proper start time on their materials suggests this runs more on Southern charm than race-day precision. When your course description is just 'endless miles of quiet dirt roads,' you're not selling tactical sophistication."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Elite groups showed unique race dynamics - K-Dogg described pace dropping to \"10 mph! Snacks were opened. Drinks were drunk. Conversation began\" on pavement sections before returning to race speed. JOM noted that at aid stations \"everyone stopped, nobody kept rolling\" creating a distinctly social gravel experience ending with Good People Brewing Company beer."
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Founded to honor late bikepacker John Little, the race maintains grassroots character with \"homegrown, lighthearted, and fun\" vibes according to organizers. K-Dogg appreciated the civilized group dynamics and \"1,000 thanks for the promoters, volunteers and riders for a wonderful day of playing with our bikes in the dirt\" captures the authentic community atmosphere."

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "The 2023 sixty-mile race saw tight elite competition with Alex McClellan and Jeffrey Tanski separated by just 0.4 seconds after 3+ hours. However, K-Dogg noted significant attrition as \"the pack whittled down to 15 due to fatigue and flats\" then to \"eight or nine grim and grimy racers,\" limiting competitive depth throughout the field. Less competitive depth than Almanzo 100."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Organizers designed the race \"for fun, not for profit\" with entry including \"two beers at the Red Clay Brewing Company\" for packet pickup and post-race festivities. The charitable mission supporting Alabama Animal Rescue Resource Foundation adds purpose, while the intimate 225-rider cap and afterparty at the actual Standard Deluxe deliver authentic value."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Registration runs $60-100. Race organizers recommend \"at least 700x38c gravel tires\" and warn against showing up \"on 700x25c and get a double flat in the first mile.\" Waverly's tiny size (population 100) limits lodging options but keeps costs low, and the rural Alabama location about 15 minutes from Auburn provides affordable access without destination resort pricing. Similar expense level to Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."
