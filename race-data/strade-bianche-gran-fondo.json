The Gran Fondo stretches to 138km if you want the complete beating, but most mortals will find 87km with 1,350m of climbing and 21km of gravel plenty challenging.

The humidity sits around 75%, which keeps things comfortable when you're grinding through those gravel sectors."

The white gravel roads through Chianti vineyards aren't just scenic tourism - they're legitimate cycling history dating back to L'Eroica in 1997. Racing through sectors named after Fabian Cancellara while 5,000 other riders spread across Tuscany's back roads delivers the full European gran fondo experience."
