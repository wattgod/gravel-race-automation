The Francis Marion forest terrain consists of \"moderate, sustained climbs\" rather than punishing elevation."

        "explanation": "March timing caught 2023 riders in \"proper $h!te weather conditions with cold temperatures and demoralizing rain\" that created course mud pits.

        "explanation": "Multi-day festival includes Friday brewery packet pickup at Commonhouse Aleworks, overnight raid options, and Sunday \"Dirt Church\" sponsored by Trek Bicycle Store.

      "experience": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Francis Marion's Revolutionary War history and weekend festival atmosphere create memorable experiences beyond racing.

Environmental emphasis on \"leaving the forest as we found it\" and horse trail sharing add authentic backcountry elements."

        "explanation": "Post-race hangouts encourage riders to \"share their stories of #gravelfreedom\" around food trucks, while multi-day programming from Friday brewery visits to Sunday \"Dirt Church\" builds weekend community. Environmental stewardship messaging and Revolutionary War historical context create shared purpose beyond individual racing goals."

      "field_depth": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "No published field size, no notable past winners, no visible pro participation despite years of operation. The pricing structure suggests they're targeting recreational riders, not competitive depth. South Carolina's gravel scene isn't exactly a talent hotbed, and this race isn't pulling anyone serious from outside the region."

        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "$175 entry includes t-shirt and post-event food, which is standard regional pricing for a 65-mile event. Francis Marion National Forest access and March weather timing add legitimate value. The under-26 discount shows awareness of budget constraints, but you're paying full price for minimal race infrastructure."

      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
