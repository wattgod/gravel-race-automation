        "score": 2,

      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "The rural Kansas location keeps lodging and travel costs reasonable. With trailhead parking available and basic amenities in nearby Sylvan Grove, the expense structure stays accessible for regional mountain bikers."
