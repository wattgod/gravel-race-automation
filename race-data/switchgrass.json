      "length": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "The 65-mile distance demands sustained pacing without being extreme. Muir's approach reflects the challenge: \"My plan, as always, is do what you have to do to get to the finish line on time, in one piece and don't be a dick.\""

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "The Flint Hills terrain features \"tallgrass prairie rolls out deep green on every side, the land rising and falling to a faraway horizon.\" Technical demands come from navigation rather than bike handling, with riders relying \"solely on their Garmin to get to the finish line.\""

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Kansas delivers more vertical than expected. As one rider noted: \"19k of climbing is not flat,\" contradicting assumptions about prairie terrain. The Switchgrass Mountain Bike Trail earns its local nickname \"Rollercoaster\" for grinding climbs and swooping descents."
      },
      "climate": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Mid-80s temperatures create heat management challenges. Muir experienced how \"the temps were in the mid-80s and the heat got my attention...A few hours later the mercury started cranking back up again\" after dawn relief."

      "altitude": {
        "score": 1,

        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "The course travels through authentic Flint Hills where \"the big bluestem and the wild alfalfa and the switchgrass and the Indian grass and the buffalo grass waving and swaying in the wind\" create immersive prairie adventure beyond typical gravel racing."
      },
      "prestige": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "The event connects to Kansas's premier IMBA Epic trail system but lacks major industry recognition. Riders tackle challenging distances that push personal limits rather than competing for significant cycling community status or media coverage."
      },
      "race_quality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Self-supported format creates logistical challenges. Muir found service station resupply difficult: \"It was a bit difficult to find anything that I wanted to eat at those to be honest,\" with no traditional aid stations for rider support."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "The combination of GPS-only navigation, prairie immersion, and personal challenge creates memorable racing. Muir's sunrise moment captures the experience: \"The sunrise was spectacular and brought my energy back\" during his multi-day effort."
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Service station stops become social hubs where Muir would \"have a chat with anyone within range.\" His encounters with other riders, like \"Joe on a single speed and Tyler on a bike with only a front brake working,\" exemplify the supportive atmosphere."
      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "The field attracts committed recreational riders willing to tackle serious distances. Muir's preparation reflects typical participant dedication: extensive training and equipment optimization for \"the long haul not for speed\" on his Salsa Cutthroat setup."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "The self-supported format and connection to quality trail systems provide solid value for dedicated gravel riders. Access to the region's premier riding terrain and multi-day adventure potential justify the investment for prairie exploration."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Rural Kansas location keeps costs reasonable with basic lodging and travel infrastructure. Muir's equipment choices show typical participant investment: quality bikes like his ENVE-equipped Cutthroat built for durability over speed in remote terrain."
