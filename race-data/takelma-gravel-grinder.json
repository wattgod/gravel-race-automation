The 30-mile \"Decaf\" option with only 1,300 feet of climbing acknowledges that many riders want less than the Bold route delivers. More compact than Grinduro."

CollinStriz noted \"intense consecutive climbing\" that \"had just taken everything out of you to get up.\" Similar technical demands to Gravel Worlds."

The 8:30AM start time acknowledges incoming heat, but that's still brutal conditions for a 6,400-foot climbing effort. Pre-race coffee at 6AM suggests organizers know riders need early fuel for the temperature battle ahead. More weather exposure than Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Starting at Seven Feathers Casino around 600-800 feet with climbs reaching maybe 2,000-3,000 feet maximum keeps this in sea level range. No altitude considerations for performance or acclimatization needed—the challenge comes from gradient and heat, not thin air. Lower altitude than Gravel Worlds — no thin-air concerns."
      },
      "adventure": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "The route delivers backroad exploration through South Umpqua River farm and ranch landscapes, reaching Chief Miwaleta Park and Galesville Reservoir views. Starting inside a casino and emerging into rural Oregon gravel roads provides authentic adventure cycling, even if the first 13 miles of pavement delay the payoff."
      },
      "prestige": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "CollinStriz called it his \"First Gravel Grinder\" and had \"a great experience,\" but this remains a regional event without national recognition. The 250-rider cap keeps it intimate rather than prestigious, and while part of the Oregon Triple Crown Series, that branding carries minimal weight beyond local cyclists."

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "The chip-timed KOM section from mile 15-21 and separate \"Coffee Grinder Trophies for Top KOM & Finishers\" show competitive structure exists. SAG support, aid stations with electrolyte drinks, and the 43-mile timed portion demonstrate organized event management, though the 250-rider field keeps it more intimate than elite."

Post-race Squatchee Fest at the casino provides social gathering, though evidence of deeper community culture remains limited."

The casino venue consolidates parking, lodging, and celebration logistics. Completing three Oregon Triple Crown events earns a custom Pactimo jersey bonus."

      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,

Because of the layout of the event and I am a one-woman-team, I only camped out at this singular location. I was pretty happy with the spot overall for the variety in shots.\n\nThis very logging road-centric event is put on by the awesome Mudslinger Events and hosted by Seven Feathers Casino & Resort in Canyonville, Oregon (2021). Mudslinger Events have great sponsors such as the host, 7 Feathers, and Takelma Coffee Co., and then nutrition products like Hammer Nutrition and Bob's Red Mill, and lastly some great sponsored winnings, Panaracer Gravel King + tires. \n\nI'm hired by the event director through Mudslinger and my primary photography role is to get great shots for social media and heavily highlight the sponsors of the race. That can be anything from the venue hosting, product sponsors, and athletes with sponsor kits or hardware. Aid stations (couldn't get them at this one) and anything that will work for media. \n\nCheck out more of the photography on my website blog, FrizzStudio.com",

          "transcript": "[Music]\nGood morning. Welcome to another Two\nWheel Wednesdays.\nToday I'm at Seven Feathers Resort,\nCanyonville, Oregon, and it's the uh\nfinal race of the Oregon Triple Crown.\nIt's the SAS. It's the Telma gravel\ngrinder.\nAnd here we go. Um, we got about 15\nminutes before the racer meeting.\nSo, I'm just doing some spinning to\nloosen the legs a little bit.\nAnd uh\nI checked in last night, got my number,\nmy timing chip, camped out in the\nparking lot\nwith a bunch of other two wheeled\nwackos.\nAnd it's the usual pre-race\nshenanigans.\nhad a guy named Andrew come up and say\nthanks for the videos. That was very\nnice. I always appreciate that.\nThanks, Andrew.\nHere's a map of today's route. We start\nout here in Canyonville and ride along\nthe south fork of the Umpqua River for\nabout 10 miles before turning south onto\ngravel and decidedly uphill. Over the\nnext 10 miles, we climb about 3,000 ft\nbefore dropping down for a ride along\nthe Gailville Reservoir to catch our\nbreath. From there, we climb up and over\nthat same ridge, pass through the end of\nthe timing, the end of the race part of\nthe ride, and drop down to the Umpqua\nagain. And from there, it's back to our\nstart in Canyonville. All in all, it's\nabout 55 miles with a little more than\n6,000 ft of climbing, mainly\nconcentrated in just 35 miles. According\nto Mike Ripley, the event organizer, the\nTacoma gravel grinder has the most\nclimbing per mile of any gravel race in\nOregon, and it's the only one with its\nunique start through a casino.\nAll right. All right.\nThank you. Bye.\nGoing\nand away we go.\nThat was fun.\non the flat section leading up to the\ngravel. I joined in on a pace line and\nwe kept the speed high while I was able\nto draft behind those bigger guys and\nsave some energy.\nHere we go. It's time to climb.\nOnce the climbing started though, our\nlittle group shattered and just one\nother guy hung with me on that first\nuphill.\nAll right. Well, that's the end of the\nfirst climb. That was pretty steep. did\n20% according to my here. But I did\ngood.\nIt's going to be warm up here. This is\nmy first ride of this distance,\nso I'm quite intimidated.\nOh, never 24 miles, 47 miles,\nlike 4,000 elevation.\nAnd there's the rest of us that have\nother parts of our lives.\nWas that the first?\nYeah, that's it.\nIt was a It was a short one, but\nOkay.\nBut it was the steep one.\nYeah, it was.\nUh, I'm going to stop.\nI got to have my water bottles.\nThat's a possibility.\nIf you could fill that up with water,\nthat'd be great.\nYeah. Camp for keys only.\nYeah. And so he might be on his way up\nhere.\nI don't know cuz I can't reach him.\nBut I wondered if there was someone down\nthere with cell phones that they could\njust like\nget in touch with him, let him know that\nI'm leaving them here.\nYes. I I will text the race director.\nSee you in a few miles, I suppose.\nAll right. You'll catch me on the\ndownhill.\n[Laughter]\nYou'll be great.\nOkay,\nthat was nice. So, I wasn't expecting\nthat.\nAll right,\nwe're about 2 miles into the second\nclimb, second big climb,\nand uh\nit's already warming up pretty nicely.\nIt's just a little after 10:00 in the\nmorning.\nIt's going to be a hot one.\nHopefully, I'll finish before it gets\ntoo hot.\nLuckily, so far we've been in the shade.\nWe're out in the sun this afternoon.\nThat could be brutal.\n30 minutes later.\nWe're out in the sun,\nbut I'm slowly catching people.\nJust about a mile to go in this climb.\nIt's a grinder.\nThe stretch along the Gailsville\nReservoir was flat, paved, and\nrefreshingly cool. It was a great break\nfrom the rough gravel roads and a good\nplace to grab a bite to eat and take a\nfew big gulps of hydration before the\nnext climb.\nSo, we're heading up the last final\nclimb.\nGarin says\nnow 4.9 miles to go,\nbut really this climb has two false\nsummits\nbefore the top. So, you get a little bit\nof a break.\nYeah,\nit's still a grind.\nThe decelma\ngravel\ngrind\nHeat. Heat.\nOh, good. We're going this way.\nIt was during this section on the way up\nto the highest point of the route where\nmy Garmin said it reached 96°.\nIt was way too hot for me and I lost a\nlot of time to the other racers. on this\nlast climb.\nI think that's the top of\nthe second big climb.\nAh, that was hard.\nOkay, onward.\nWe have about eight more miles before\nthe finish the time section.\nThat was brutal.\n[Applause]\nOh no. Oh no.\nAh, my chain fell off.\nDon't go back.\nStart over.\nHere we go. We have water and PBJs\nand ice in the cooler.\nSomething cold would be good.\nYeah, feel free to put some ice in your\nbottle or whatnot.\nThe PVJS are better on ice.\nWell, you want a colder one,\nright? Get that baby back on there for\nyou.\nThere it is. Come on.\nOh, thank you.\nYeah, absolutely. No, that's the worst\nto be trying to do anything with hot\nbody and hot hands and all that.\nBut I mean, it's like 10 yards from the\nfinish.\nNo, it's close.\nLike, oh,\ndid you drop it any other time? No.\nNo, of course. Right.\nAnd it's not like I hit a bump or I was\nshifting or anything.\nNo, I just decided that, you know, need\nto walk across the\nIt's like, oh, that's the finish. Let's\nmake this a little tougher.\nThanks.\nOh man,\nthat was hard. My legs.\nI just didn't have it today. I don't\nknow if it was the heat\nor\nwhat, but I just didn't have it today.\nSo, I don't think I made the podium\noverall.\nUm, but\nthat's all right. I got closer than I\nthought I would.\nAll right. Well, I guess that wraps it\nup for this week's two- wheeled\nWednesdays.\nWell, it doesn't matter. Doesn't matter\nif you race or not. Doesn't matter if\nyou come in dead last or first by a\nmile.\nIt doesn't matter\nbecause life is twice as good on two\nwheels. We'll see you in the next one.",

        "search_text": "The Takelma Gravel Grinder is a 55-mile race with over 6,000 feet of climbing, making it the most climbing per mile of any gravel race in Oregon according to organizers. The unique race starts inside Seven Feathers Casino in Canyonville. Riders follow the South Fork Umpqua River for 10 miles before turning onto steep gravel roads that climb 3,000 feet over the next 10 miles. The course features narrow, remote gravel roads with no car traffic and grades reaching 20%. Key challenges include sustained steep climbs that cause experienced riders to cramp, and a final climb with two false summits. The Gailsville Reservoir section provides flat, paved relief between climbs. Heat becomes a major factor as the day progresses, with morning sections offering shade but afternoon sun exposure being brutal. The race attracts 75-80 riders and includes post-race food and drink tickets."
