        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Multi-day format through varying Hill Country terrain from Edwards Plateau farms to river valley crossings creates solid riding variety.

      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "With daily A/B/C route options and no timing, participants self-select based on current fitness rather than competitive performance. Aikigreg's concern about \"lack of current conditioning\" making longer routes inadvisable reflects the recreational rather than racing field composition."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Early registration at $160 for a week of supported rides, seminars, and social events provides reasonable value for a training camp format. The 25% discount for RAAM qualifier participants and multi-day supported riding makes the math work for serious mileage accumulation."
