However, no parking, lodging, or packet pickup details are documented anywhere."

        "explanation": "The 50-mile distance delivers what Jared Dunham called 'probably the most memorable 50 mile race course I've done so far... very hilly with some sand thrown in.' Three distance options (19/34/50 miles) mean beginners get their shorter route while the full distance provides substantial challenge without epic 100+ mile suffering."

        "explanation": "Lachlan Morton ran Vittoria Terreno Dry 38mm tires at Unbound, while Alex Howes opted for the same setup without aerobars, noting 'he had it a lot harder than the guys who had mounted extensions.' The sandy two-track through Gilbert Corners keeps riders guessing about equipment choices, though skill and high-volume tires make the course rideable at speed."
      },
      "elevation": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Matthew Lee gained strategic advantage in 2009 by 'beginning his climb up Richmond Peak at 5am whereas the others did not start until 5:45am.' All routes are described as 'very hilly' with El Diablo on E. 35 Rd. being 'both steep and long.' The 2500 feet over 50 miles creates consistent climbing without massive single ascents."
      },
      "climate": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Weather volatility defines the divide experience. In 2009, 'quarter-inch sized hail was beginning to be a near-daily occurrence for race leaders,' while other years saw riders awakening to 'frost covered bikes. Brrr!' The July timing puts riders into peak summer heat, though recent races moved start times earlier to avoid the worst temperatures."
      },
      "altitude": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Manton, Michigan sits firmly in the Midwest flatlands with no meaningful elevation above sea level. The hills are real, but you're not getting any altitude training benefits or respiratory challenges here."
      },
      "adventure": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Giorgio Dalla Costa described his divide experience as accepting 'Art expressing herself spontaneously, without any compromise, traveling, dreaming, feeling free.' The course through Manistee National Forest includes the named Redneck Roughneck downhill and Amish Sawmill area, creating memorable character beyond typical gravel racing."
      },
      "prestige": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Started in 2015 as a fundraiser for Manton Public School's cross country and track teams, The Divide remains a regional Michigan Gravel Race Series event. Elite riders like Matthew Lee and Lael Wilcox race the Tour Divide, not this small-town Michigan fundraiser. No pro field, prize purse, or notable winners documented."
      },
      "race_quality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Three distance options and thoughtful course design with named features like El Diablo and Gilbert Corners show someone cares. Michael Hodges noted courses are 'marked to perfection, aid stations are well stocked' with 'that good ol' races with the old school ultra vibe.' The Outer Loop alternates direction annually, which most organizers wouldn't bother with."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "The mix of forest roads and sandy two-track through Amish territory creates memorable character. Bethany described divide terrain where 'the road was a little boggy but it was worth it, the views were some of the best of the entire Divide.' However, starting from a small Michigan railroad park limits the overall experience compared to destination events."
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Being part of the Michigan Gravel Race Series means there's a regional scene that shows up consistently. Flint and Scarlet Zeigler emphasized how divide experiences create lasting bonds: 'heartfelt bridges are built again' through shared challenges. The fundraiser nature and team discounts suggest they're trying to build something beyond just racing."
      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Hunter Post won his age group with 4th overall, while Terry Ritter took 1st in 50+ class, indicating thin competitive depth across categories. Michael Hodges finished 13th 'just 1:40 behind 9th place' in a different divide race, suggesting modest field sizes where top-10 finishes are achievable for recreational racers."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Three distance options, team discounts, and a thoughtfully designed course through national forest territory without premium destination pricing. Alexandera Houchin's singlespeed record attempt shows divide racing rewards preparation over expensive equipment. The 50-mile option delivers real mileage for whatever they're charging while supporting local school athletics."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Manton, Michigan keeps lodging and food costs reasonable compared to tourist destinations. Equipment requirements stay modest - riders have suggested 'tires in the mid 32-38cc and up' without exotic gear needs. Entry fees aren't documented, but the fundraiser nature and regional scope likely keep costs accessible for Michigan riders."
