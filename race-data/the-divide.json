In 2009, 'quarter-inch sized hail was beginning to be a near-daily occurrence for race leaders,' while other years saw riders awakening to 'frost covered bikes. Brrr!' The July timing puts riders into peak summer heat, though recent races moved start times earlier to avoid the worst temperatures. More weather exposure than Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego.

The Outer Loop alternates direction annually, which most organizers wouldn't bother with."

However, starting from a small Michigan railroad park limits the overall experience compared to destination events."

This race was 2 weeks prior to a planned 7 day Colorado bike packing trip, so crashing and injuries were not an option. I had to play this safe and conservative. Which resulted in me basically doing a solo TT after the first 20 minutes. \n\nThis race was a bit a mess for me. After realizing I lost all my nutrition, but didn't know exactly when or where,  I was scrambling on how to resolve this. First I thought maybe I'll just try to finish the race without any fuel, ugh. Then, I thought surely my competition would have extra and willing to share.... they did not. Finally, at some point I remembered something about Aid Stations that was briefed at the start when I wasn't paying attention. So the goal was to find some of those and rely on whatever they had.   \n\nI found the first aid station at 42:05 and their was a bit of confusion as all they said they had was Coke, water and pickles, but no gels or fuel. I heard one of the guys call out Gatorade and realized they at least had that, so filled my bottle and chugged some Coke.  I stopped at 52:01 and topped off my bottle and again at 1:35:50. At 1:27:01 I nailed my my first ever drink hand-up from a volunteer handing out Gatorade.  Even though my nutrition plan was gone and the aid station mix was upsetting my stomach, I stayed positive and kept steady. I was able to pick off quite a few riders later in the race which was encouraging and placed 19th overall, my best gravel race finish to date.\n\nThe Divide is a gravel road bike race held in Manton, MI. The Divide is a part of the Michigan Gravel Race Series and there are three distances to choose from; 19, 34, & 50 miles.   All three routes are very hilly (4K+ elevation gain) and include a mixture of gravel, seasonal, and forest roads some of which have some very deep sandy spots, plenty that require forced hike-a-bike.\n\n👉 Hey!

The Divide is a part of the Michigan Gravel Race Series and there were three distances to choose from; 19, 34, & 50 miles.  I raced the 50 mile but all routes are hilly (50 mi has 4K+ elevation gain) and include a mixture of gravel, seasonal, and forest roads. There were also some very deep sandy spots that require forced hike-a-bike. The 50 mile was interesting as it was an out, 2 loops, then a back. The \"out\" and \"back\" were the really sandy sections but the \"loops\" were hilly but good gravel.\n\nIt's been a tough go of training over the past few weeks as I've had to travel a lot for work, work long hours and had many nights of poor sleep. Couple that with this week being the end of my \"recovery week\", left my legs feeling flat and heavy. I didn't have high expectations but hoped my previous months of training would carry me through.\n\nEarly on a breakaway of 2 went off the front never to be seen again with the eventual winner of the race. Then, there was a split between the 34 and 50 milers that juggled the group. Apparently a last minute change was all groups and all distances going off in one mass group start. After the split a lead group formed until we hit the deep sand sections where we split up. We all regrouped once, but then the group shattered again once we hit more deep sand. From there were only singles and small groups remaining. I didn't have the legs on the day to go with the few ahead, so I settled into a group of 3 (7th - 9th place). Early on we passed a rider and became 6th - 8th place but never saw anyone from our race and basically just settled into a sustainable pace.\n\nOn the way back after the loops into the sandy sections I lost my front wheel in some deep sand and toppled over. The topple over was slow and soft, but the guy running into me from behind was not. Our bikes got tangled and scratched up, but were ridable. I was able to quickly get going and eventually dropped the 2 guys I was riding with all race. Shorty after I caught 5th place and thought we could work together to the finish. Unfortunately he crashed and never caught up to me to work together.  Coming out of the sand I had a 40 second gap, but noticed the 3 I had dropped were all together. With 20+ minutes remaining in the race, I knew I wouldn't be able to hold them off if they worked together. So I slow pedaled and waited for them to catch up becoming a group of 4 (5th - 8th place).\n\nThe 4 of us stayed together until about the last mile where the wheel I was following got gapped on the last big hill. I gambled and thought one of the guys would close it, but they never did and 5th place got away. Ugh, I played that wrong. So, now I was sprinting for 6th place amongst the 3 of us and just waited to make my move. I was able secure 6th place , just 6 seconds behind 5th place and 20 seconds behind 4th place whom we never saw. \n\n👉 Hey!

The 34 and 50 mile courses rotate direction each year. Lots of climbing, two track and gnarly sand. This is definitely the most difficult race in the MGRS, but so worth the challenge. Highly recommend if you haven't been to it!\n\nNo notable results for me, as I started too far back from the front group thinking I could catch up right away, but that wasn't the case. I thought for sure they'd settle and would be able to catch them, but I was dead wrong. Still had a great race with good group of riders.\n\nhttps://hardracingevents.com/events/the-divide/\nhttps://www.michigangravelraceseries.com/",
