      "summary": "THE EQUALIZER is Missouri's state gravel championship—100 miles through wine country in late July heat. The course is rolling but not brutal (5,000 ft, constant ups and downs, no mountain climbs). The challenge is the weather: 90-95°F with 70-85% humidity means heat index over 100°F. This is a hydration and heat-management test more than a fitness test. The wine country setting is scenic, and Missouri gravel is smooth compared to mountain states. But the heat is relentless—15-20% DNF rates are heat-related. State championship brings some fast racers, but the field is mostly recreational (200-300 riders). St. Louis airport is 1 hour away, making travel easy. Marthasville is small, but nearby St. Charles has lodging. This is an emerging Midwest gravel scene event—not iconic, but solid.",

      "bottom_line": "If you want a legitimate suffer fest from terrain, look elsewhere. If you want to test heat survival and hydration management—THE EQUALIZER delivers. Come in July shape (heat-acclimated), hydrate obsessively, and start early. The wine country scenery is nice, but you'll be too hot to care. The state championship jersey is a nice bonus if you podium. Otherwise, this is a regional heat test, not a bucket-list race."

The oppressive humidity pushes heat index over 100°F, turning the second half into a survival march through wine country that looks better than it feels. More weather exposure than Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

Lower altitude than Gravel Worlds — no thin-air concerns."

really good time and it was\ngood to see them and then the next\nmorning was the day of the race so from\nFarmington to St geneve it's only like a\n30 minute drive so we got up about 5:30\nand then made our way to the race what's\ncool about this event is St Jinn is\nactually the oldest French Settlement\nwest of the Mississippi River so there's\na ton of history in St Jinn really\nreally cool old town with lots of cool\nstuff to see so you pull up and they\nkind of block off this little downtown\narea and this race is hosted by a group\ncalled trailet so it's nice they've got\nlots of porta-potties there do your\nmorning business they've got the\ncheck-in process was really really\nsmooth they've got a guy that runs the\ntiming system who kind of acts as a DJ\nas well and he was awesome so either way\nwe got our packets we got changed Kim\nwas doing the 18m route and I was doing\nthe 78 M route which technically was\nsupposed to be 81 miles and then uh\nthere was a 44 mile route so there was\nsomething for everyone which is also\nnice about this event and I believe\nthere was also a threemile route for\nlittle kids so super\ncool I got my boy Eric here we rode\ntogether pretty much the whole day last\nyear what's up dude going no I'mma do\nthese are not the same I got new shoes\ntoday my baby miss me wishing it was two\nof me and\nI'm been\ndown\nbeen\ntwer I think they call this little Ridge\nhere Thunder Ridge pretty cool it's like\na levy and uh it's grass a little bit of\ngrass gravel but mostly grass this year\nthe winds were coming out of the South\nso last year it was super windy at this\nrace this year the wind was kind of\nflipped we're on this like Levy for\nprobably a good five miles going\ndirectly into a headwind uh but I'm good\nwith this because you know the beginning\nof a race you're fresh and honestly I'd\nrather have a headwin to start the race\nand then Tailwind to to finish the\nrace dude shout out trailet for painting\nthe road like that's clutch right\nnow uh the signs are great but sometimes\nthose get moved or turned around uh but\nthe arrows on the road really really\nreally help top speed going top one one\ngoing in the paint no flop at The\nRim so as we got on to some of the\ncountry gravel roads I got to say this\narea is unbelievably beautiful I think\nas a kid you really don't appreciate the\nbeauty of things even the night before\nwhen we were at my Dad's hanging out I\nkind of looked around his property and I\nthought to myself man I lived here for\nseveral years and I never really\nappreciated how beautiful this area is\nguys St Genevie this area like the\ncountryside it almost feels like you're\nin another country like you're in the\ncountryside of France or something I\ndon't know I've never been to France but\nI imagine this is kind of how it looks\nlike it's just absolutely beautiful\nthese beautiful old houses Old Farms\nit's just a really really pretty area so\naround mile 21 we kind of came to a fork\nin the road where the 81m route had to\nturn right and the 44 mile route had to\ngo left there were some people like\nflagging us down they were like there's\nno 81 mile route there's no it's not\nhappening the 81 mile route is canceled\nfor severe storms so me and Eric a guy I\nwas riding with who was also on the 81m\nmile route we were like so we we can't\nride like no there's really really bad\nstorms coming so at this point Eric and\nI were like okay I guess we're going to\ngo with the 44 mile Riders and I didn't\nknow how they were going to place it but\nI had kind of prepared to ride 81 miles\nso you know this may have been a\nblessing for me because if I was only\ndoing 45 miles I probably would have\nblown up gone super hard from the start\nbut I still had some energy so as soon\nas we were on the 44 mile route I was\nlike all right I'm laying the hammer\ndown everything I got it's going to be a\nTailwind most of the way back and I was\nracing\nSP what's the plan I get it done it's me\nyeah neighborhood it's me yeah IE new\nfriends now the other issue with this\nwas I had the 81 mile route programmed\non my computer so I didn't have the 44\nmile route downloaded so luckily there\nwas this guy John that I met he kind of\nhelped me find my way which I appreciate\nthat thank you John and like I said the\ncourse was marked really well well so\nthat helped but at one point the the GPS\nkind of corrected itself and it had me\nback on course because eventually the\n81m route loop back in and kind of tied\nback in with the route so I didn't know\nat this point where I stacked up so I\nwas definitely passing some of the guys\non the 44m route but I had no idea how\nthey were going to place the race so I\nwas thinking to myself okay you lay the\nhammer down you're passing some people\nyou might be top three in the 44m route\nand if they place the 81 m route still\nyou might be first in that Division I\nhonestly didn't know how many riders\nwere off the front at the start of the\nrace so as soon as I crossed the Finish\nLine there was a guy kind of standing\nthere he's like hey man I think you got\nthird and I was like dude that that\nwould be sweet they're going to Podium\ntop three so I go to the guy who is\nrunning the Finish Line like the timing\nsystem the the timer guy/ DJ he was\nawesome by the way I mean I feel bad for\nrace organizers anytime they have to\nlike uh cancel a ride or cut a ride\nshort because they can't control the\nweather and the storms that were coming\nwere absolutely gnarly so I'm very\nthankful honestly that they didn't let\nlet us ride into those but either way I\ngo to the timer guy and I was like hey\nuh this is my name um I'm assuming\nyou're going to bump everybody to the 44\nand he's like no we're still going to\nplace out um each category so it looks\nlike you were actually first in the 81 m\nroute and I was like holy I won a\nbike race I've never won a bike race so\nthey do the podiums and Kim who was\nactually doing the 18 M route she got\nsecond in the 18 Mile overall women's\ndivision so that was freaking awesome\nand I was the champion in the 81 mile\nroute now here's the thing about podiums\nI was fortunate enough to win a high\nschool wrestling State title for\nFarmington we used to beat up on St Jen\nactually we were kind of Rivals just\nwant to throw that in there but I've had\nlots of podiums podiums are cool\nwhatever now I'm 36 years old I'm 220 lb\n6'2 I've got clapped up knees I'm a\ngrown man racing bikes and getting a\nPodium is like the biggest deal in the\nworld for me now I don't race bikes to\nget podiums I race bikes to challenge\nmyself and push myself but I'm not going\nto lie getting on a Podium uh feels good\nbut there was kind of some Rumblings\nafter the race like hey there was a few\nguys that missed the cut off um and and\nthey got rerouted like at Mile 30 I get\non straa like after the race when I got\nback to my mom's house and sure enough\nthere was at least two riders that\ndidn't get rerouted to like mile 30 so\nthey actually did like 56 miles and I\ndid 44 so technically yes I I won the\nrace but would I have caught those two\nguys uh if they didn't have the reroute\nI don't know I mean should happens but\nthese guys seem like they were pretty\nstrong guys I'll take it it's a Podium\nI'm stoked about it but either way the\natmosphere at this event is fantastic I\nactually uh the winners won a jersey and\nI got a jersey and gave it to my mom uh\nthey had a beer token there's a guy like\nplaying the guitar the whole atmosphere\nis just fantastic they had a food truck\nand I got to say this about trailet they\nhave a really cool thing going on so\nthey have the saint Shin gravel classic\nwhich is I believe the first uh gravel\nrace in their series of gravel events so\nthey're hosting two more gravel events\nthis year but it's kind of cool if you\nwant to sign up for all three trailet\ngravel events they have like a package\ndeal that will save you some money as\nopposed to signing up for the races\nindividually and then myself my mom and\nKim we walked around downtown St Jin we\nchecked out some of the super old\nhistoric buildings and then after the\nrace on Saturday night Kim and I and my\nmom went back to Hillsboro where my mom\nlives I had some family come over uh we\ngot Emos pizza because you can't visit\nSt Louis and not get Emos pizza so we\ngot some Emos Pizza we hung out and\nhonestly it was just a really really\ngood weekend but either way guys I\nappreciate you checking out the video\nthose trailet events that I was talking\nabout I'm going to link those in the\ndescription of the video If you guys\nlike this video
