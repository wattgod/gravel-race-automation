      "summary": "THE EQUALIZER is Missouri's state gravel championship—100 miles through wine country in late July heat. The course is rolling but not brutal (5,000 ft, constant ups and downs, no mountain climbs). The challenge is the weather: 90-95°F with 70-85% humidity means heat index over 100°F. This is a hydration and heat-management test more than a fitness test. The wine country setting is scenic, and Missouri gravel is smooth compared to mountain states. But the heat is relentless—15-20% DNF rates are heat-related. State championship brings some fast racers, but the field is mostly recreational (200-300 riders). St. Louis airport is 1 hour away, making travel easy. Marthasville is small, but nearby St. Charles has lodging. This is an emerging Midwest gravel scene event—not iconic, but solid.",

      "bottom_line": "If you want a legitimate suffer fest from terrain, look elsewhere. If you want to test heat survival and hydration management—THE EQUALIZER delivers. Come in July shape (heat-acclimated), hydrate obsessively, and start early. The wine country scenery is nice, but you'll be too hot to care. The state championship jersey is a nice bonus if you podium. Otherwise, this is a regional heat test, not a bucket-list race."

Similar elevation profile to Gravel Worlds."

The oppressive humidity pushes heat index over 100°F, turning the second half into a survival march through wine country that looks better than it feels. More weather exposure than Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

        "explanation": "Marthasville sits in the Missouri River Valley at basically sea level with zero altitude considerations.

Lower altitude than Gravel Worlds — no thin-air concerns."

Pretty countryside that won't change your life but delivers solid Midwest gravel character."

Field size remains intimate but draws competitive depth for state championship titles. Similar competitive depth to Rule of Three."

      "expenses": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Registration runs $85-$110. Free onsite camping at Wessel Park eliminates hotel costs, while Marthasville keeps dining affordable with small-town pricing. St. Charles 20 miles away offers more lodging options if needed. STL airport access within an hour, and Missouri doesn't gouge you on gas or food like coastal race destinations. More affordable than Crusher in the Tushar."

      "should_you_race": "If you can handle 95°F with 80% humidity while grinding constant rollers for six hours, this is solid Midwest racing. The course won't break you—smooth gravel, manageable elevation—but July heat will cook anyone who shows up with two bottles and a prayer. Perfect for riders wanting state championship bragging rights without the technical demands of mountain races.",
      "alternatives": "Gravel Worlds in Nebraska offers similar Midwest terrain with bigger fields and better logistics. If you want actual challenging terrain instead of just challenging weather, hit up Rebecca's Private Idaho or the Crusher in the Tushar where the mountains do the work instead of the thermometer."
