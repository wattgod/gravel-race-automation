      "summary": "THE EQUALIZER is Missouri's state gravel championship—100 miles through wine country in late July heat. The course is rolling but not brutal (5,000 ft, constant ups and downs, no mountain climbs). The challenge is the weather: 90-95°F with 70-85% humidity means heat index over 100°F. This is a hydration and heat-management test more than a fitness test. The wine country setting is scenic, and Missouri gravel is smooth compared to mountain states. But the heat is relentless—15-20% DNF rates are heat-related. State championship brings some fast racers, but the field is mostly recreational (200-300 riders). St. Louis airport is 1 hour away, making travel easy. Marthasville is small, but nearby St. Charles has lodging. This is an emerging Midwest gravel scene event—not iconic, but solid.",

      "bottom_line": "If you want a legitimate suffer fest from terrain, look elsewhere. If you want to test heat survival and hydration management—THE EQUALIZER delivers. Come in July shape (heat-acclimated), hydrate obsessively, and start early. The wine country scenery is nice, but you'll be too hot to care. The state championship jersey is a nice bonus if you podium. Otherwise, this is a regional heat test, not a bucket-list race."

        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Rolling through Missouri River Valley wine country is legitimately beautiful, with the Katy Trail crossing adding historic flavor. But late July heat (85-95°F with 70-85% humidity) turns the second half into a survival march. The scenery's nice until you're dying from heat exhaustion at mile 60."

        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "State championship draws Missouri's competitive gravel racers but maintains that Midwest friendly vibe.

Field size of 200-300 keeps it personal—you'll actually talk to people instead of getting lost in a cattle drive."

        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "State championship status attracts Missouri's fastest gravel riders, so the pointy end has legitimate speed.

      "value": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Registration at $85-$110 for a state championship with proper support is fair money.

      "expenses": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Marthasville keeps costs reasonable with limited but affordable local lodging options. St. Charles is 20 miles away with more hotel choices if you need them. STL airport is an hour drive, and Missouri doesn't rape you on gas or food like coastal states."

        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "5,000 feet over 100 miles means constant Missouri River Valley rollers with no recovery. Not one monster climb you can survive—just relentless ups and downs that grind you down. The kind of elevation that sneaks up and destroys your legs by mile 80."

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Late July in Missouri is a heat death sentence—90-95°F with crushing humidity pushing heat index over 100°F. 2023 saw 20% DNF from extreme heat, 2024 hit 15% DNF. This isn't racing, it's heat stroke roulette with some cycling thrown in."

      "altitude": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Marthasville sits in the Missouri River Valley at basically sea level. Zero altitude considerations unless you count the slight elevation change from your couch to the start line. Your biggest respiratory challenge will be the oppressive humidity, not thin air."

      "logistics": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Marthasville Community Center provides solid race HQ with parking handled. STL airport is a reasonable hour drive, and packet pickup runs both day-before and race morning. Small town logistics work in your favor—everything's close, nothing's complicated."

      "adventure": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Missouri wine country roads through the River Valley offer genuine scenic beauty and the Katy Trail crossing adds historical texture. But it's still Missouri county roads, not epic mountain passes or desert wastelands. Pretty countryside that won't change your life or Instagram engagement."

      "should_you_race": "If you can handle 95°F with 80% humidity while grinding constant rollers for six hours, this is solid Midwest racing. The course won't break you—smooth gravel, manageable elevation—but July heat will cook anyone who shows up with two bottles and a prayer. Perfect for riders wanting state championship bragging rights without the technical demands of mountain races.",
      "alternatives": "Gravel Worlds in Nebraska offers similar Midwest terrain with bigger fields and better logistics. If you want actual challenging terrain instead of just challenging weather, hit up Rebecca's Private Idaho or the Crusher in the Tushar where the mountains do the work instead of the thermometer."
