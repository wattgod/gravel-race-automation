The course is rolling but not brutal (5,000 ft, constant ups and downs, no mountain climbs). The challenge is the weather: 90-95\u00b0F with 70-85% humidity means heat index over 100\u00b0F. This is a hydration and heat-management test more than a fitness test. The wine country setting is scenic, and Missouri gravel is smooth compared to mountain states. But the heat is relentless\u201415-20% DNF rates are heat-related. State championship brings some fast racers, but the field is mostly recreational (200-300 riders). St. Louis airport is 1 hour away, making travel easy. Marthasville is small, but nearby St. Charles has lodging. This is an emerging Midwest gravel scene event\u2014not iconic, but solid.",

      "bottom_line": "If you want a legitimate suffer fest from terrain, look elsewhere. If you want to test heat survival and hydration management\u2014THE EQUALIZER delivers. Come in July shape (heat-acclimated), hydrate obsessively, and start early. The wine country scenery is nice, but you'll be too hot to care. The state championship jersey is a nice bonus if you podium. Otherwise, this is a regional heat test, not a bucket-list race."
