      "summary": "THE EQUALIZER is Missouri's state gravel championship—100 miles through wine country in late July heat. The course is rolling but not brutal (5,000 ft, constant ups and downs, no mountain climbs). The challenge is the weather: 90-95°F with 70-85% humidity means heat index over 100°F. This is a hydration and heat-management test more than a fitness test. The wine country setting is scenic, and Missouri gravel is smooth compared to mountain states. But the heat is relentless—15-20% DNF rates are heat-related. State championship brings some fast racers, but the field is mostly recreational (200-300 riders). St. Louis airport is 1 hour away, making travel easy. Marthasville is small, but nearby St. Charles has lodging. This is an emerging Midwest gravel scene event—not iconic, but solid.",

        "Brutal July heat—90-95°F + humidity = heat exhaustion risk",
        "Small field (200-300 riders) = less energy than big events",

        "Not nationally recognized—regional event"
      ],
      "bottom_line": "If you want a legitimate suffer fest from terrain, look elsewhere. If you want to test heat survival and hydration management—THE EQUALIZER delivers. Come in July shape (heat-acclimated), hydrate obsessively, and start early. The wine country scenery is nice, but you'll be too hot to care. The state championship jersey is a nice bonus if you podium. Otherwise, this is a regional heat test, not a bucket-list race."
