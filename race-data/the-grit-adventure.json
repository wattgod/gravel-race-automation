        "explanation": "Martin Criminale's pre-ride of the 45-mile version \"took us almost five hours at a moderate pace with just a few short stops,\" showing the terrain demands respect even at social pace. At 65 miles for the full course, it's substantial enough to matter without being an epic."

        "explanation": "The lollipop course mixes doubletrack, singletrack, and technical obstacles that caught Martin Criminale's fender repeatedly: \"I kept bending the front one when I tried to ride over logs.\" Water troughs require \"get off and walk your bike as the transition at the bottom is too sudden to ride.\""

      "elevation": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "5500 feet over 65 miles averages 85 feet per mile, which is climbing. The \"brutal climbs\" promise in Cascade terrain means sustained grades that \"will take your breath away.\" Not Alpine epic numbers, but enough vertical to separate the climbers from the pretenders."
      },
      "climate": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "July in the Cascades can be perfect or miserable—no weather data available, but Snoqualmie Pass sees everything from snow to heat waves. The region's reputation for unpredictable mountain weather and potential for afternoon thunderstorms makes this a gamble. You might get postcard conditions or survival mode."
      },
      "altitude": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Snoqualmie Pass location provides mountain elevation with clear-day views \"for miles in every direction,\" but specific altitude figures aren't detailed. High enough to matter for pacing, not enough to cause serious altitude issues for most riders."
      },
      "adventure": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "The first descent \"turn right into the woods\" leads to \"mostly doubletrack, singletrack, and FUN\" through forest terrain. Creek crossings, \"lush green meadows,\" and technical descents where \"some of the dips and bumps are bigger than you think\" deliver exploration over speed."
      },
      "prestige": {

        "explanation": "This is a small regional event that went dark after 2023 and just resurfaced for 2025. No notable winners, no coverage beyond a basic highlight reel from 2022, and zero buzz in the broader gravel scene. It's Adventure Gravel for locals who think suffering in the Cascades counts as prestige."

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Off-Camber Productions brings experience from MFG Cyclocross Series, and riders praise \"excellent courses\" and \"VERY POSITIVE STAFF.\" However, the tight registration window ending 30 minutes before start time and two-year disappearance suggest organizational growing pains."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Starting at Crystal Springs Sno-Park and mixing \"asphalt, dirt/gravel roads, with some double track sections\" delivers Adventure Gravel. The Cascades location promises \"adventure, giggles, dirt, sweat, hugs,\" which sounds cheesy but the terrain backs it up. At 65 miles with 5500 feet of gain, you'll earn whatever experience you get."
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "One glowing review about \"amazing culture\" and promises of \"hugs\" suggest good vibes, but where's the actual community? Camping along the I-90 corridor isn't a destination scene."
      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "No field size data, no notable participants, and a race that went dormant suggests this draws maybe 100 locals at best. The \"Maximus\" option being called a \"brute\" might attract some masochists, but this isn't pulling talent from outside Washington. It's a curiosity, not a competitive field."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "No entry fee data available, but camping along I-90 keeps costs reasonable and you get Cascade wilderness suffering. The \"hearty mix of surfaces\" on \"remote forest roads & trails\" delivers what's promised. For Adventure Gravel in prime terrain, it's probably fair value if they don't price gouge."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Snoqualmie Pass location means driving distance for most of the Pacific Northwest, and camping options keep lodging cheap. No airport info suggests you're driving anyway, which works for most regional participants. The Crystal Springs Sno-Park venue keeps venue costs minimal, though you'll pay Seattle-area food prices."
