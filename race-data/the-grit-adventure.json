Similar elevation profile to Gravel Worlds."

        "explanation": "July in the Cascades can be perfect or miserable—no weather data available, but Snoqualmie Pass sees everything from snow to heat waves. The region's reputation for unpredictable mountain weather and potential for afternoon thunderstorms makes this a gamble. You might get postcard conditions or survival mode. More weather exposure than Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego. As Fenders puts it: \"I almost never take my fenders off but for this ride, I kept bending the front one when I tried to ride over logs...\""

It's Adventure Gravel for locals who think suffering in the Cascades counts as prestige."

The Cascades location promises \"adventure, giggles, dirt, sweat, hugs,\" which sounds cheesy but the terrain backs it up. At 65 miles with 5500 feet of gain, you'll earn whatever experience you get."

        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "No field size data, no notable participants, and a race that went dormant suggests this draws maybe 100 locals at best. The \"Maximus\" option being called a \"brute\" might attract some masochists, but this isn't pulling talent from outside Washington. It's a curiosity, not a competitive field. Thinner field than Ouray Gravel Grinder."

      "value": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "No entry fee data available, but camping along I-90 keeps costs reasonable and you get Cascade wilderness suffering. The \"hearty mix of surfaces\" on \"remote forest roads & trails\" delivers what's promised. For Adventure Gravel in prime terrain, it's probably fair value if they don't price gouge."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Registration runs $85-105. Snoqualmie Pass location means driving distance for most of the Pacific Northwest, and camping options keep lodging cheap. No airport info suggests you're driving anyway, which works for most regional participants. The Crystal Springs Sno-Park venue keeps venue costs minimal, though you'll pay Seattle-area food prices. Similar expense level to Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."
