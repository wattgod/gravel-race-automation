Race directors Danny and Mike O. warn long course riders: \"don't count on any race support!\" You're on your own for everything except showing up race morning."
      },
      "length": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "The format has shifted from the original 50+ mile \"savage, barbaric\" long course to current 25-mile and 15-mile options. Race directors enforce cutoffs strictly: \"this is NOT an all day event. YOU have a cut off to make, otherwise it's black top for you!\" The distances are respectable but not endurance challenges."
      },
      "technicality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Trailforks rates this as intermediate difficulty, mixing snowmobile trails, logging roads, and creek crossings. There's an old ski hill run and various road sections including Plum Vitae and Klondike Roads. It's technical enough to keep you awake but nothing approaching true technical challenge - more navigational complexity than skill requirement."
      },
      "elevation": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "The course features \"sweet stretches of downhills\" and climbing Musky Mountain, plus an old ski hill run. Race directors note \"one bike's advantage won't last forever\" due to varied terrain demands. Northern Wisconsin's 2500 feet over 55 miles provides moderate undulation rather than serious climbing challenges."
      },
      "climate": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Mid-June conditions include \"slogging through mud\" and \"fending off mosquitoes and deer flies\" according to course descriptions. The Northern Highland forest setting concentrates insects around creek crossings and wooded sections. Weather variability can turn perfect conditions into survival challenges quickly."
      },
      "altitude": {
        "score": 1,

      "adventure": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "You're exploring the Northern Highland American Legion State Forest on snowmobile trails and logging roads, which has authentic backcountry feel. Creek crossings and remote forest sections provide some adventure factor, but it's more 'getting lost in Wisconsin woods' than epic gravel adventure. The terrain is exploratory without being genuinely challenging or scenic."
      },
      "prestige": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "This is a local mountain bike fundraiser for trail development, not a recognized gravel event. The inaugural 2021 race drew nearly 80 registrations and 120 total attendees, showing growth potential. No notable winners or pro field, but it's building regional recognition as part of the Ironbear 1000 series."

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Race organization covers essentials with same-day registration, 9:15 AM rider meeting, and 1:30 PM awards with raffles. The directors' humor shows through course descriptions: \"Oh, you're one of THOSE people! The 25ish isn't enough? You think you're better than that, don't you?\" It's functional community organizing with personality."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "The course hits Vandercook Road multiple times, crosses Plum Creek twice (once without a bridge), and travels Klondike Road through state forest terrain. \"It levels the playing field for adventurers – folks who never raced a bike event before finished and placed in the top 3, while active racers dropped like, well, flies!\""

        "score": 2,

All proceeds support the $350,000 Mus-ski Mountain Trails project. The event includes family options and connects \"like-minded silent sports enthusiasts\" for trail advocacy."
      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "The original format required minimum 20 registrations for the long course or defaulted riders to \"run the short course twice.\" Course conditions favor newcomers over experienced racers based on the inaugural results. This remains a participation event supporting trails rather than competitive racing."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Entry fees of $11.60 to $48.70 directly support trail building and maintenance in Northern Highland American Legion State Forest. You get organized adventure, awards, raffles, and meaningful contribution to a $350,000 trail development project for the price of a decent lunch."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Sayner, Wisconsin offers limited but affordable lodging and dining options typical of small northwoods towns. The race starts at Sayner Community Center with straightforward logistics. Costs remain reasonable for a weekend in Wisconsin lake country, though choices are basic."
