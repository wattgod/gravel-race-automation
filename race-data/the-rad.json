Elite racing stayed bunched through 46 miles before the field finally broke apart, with Vermeulen and Stetina's sprint finish coming after 68 miles of sustained effort. Distance plus elevation creates cumulative difficulty that separates prepared riders from the rest. Among the longest in gravel, comparable to Badlands."

Elite fields stayed together through the sustained climbing before breaking apart in the final third. Even the 47-mile option packs 4,200 feet of gain with maximum elevation of 7,221 feet.

Similar climate challenges to SBT GRVL."

The sustained climbing through thin air adds cumulative stress beyond just the elevation gain numbers. Not Leadville-level altitude punishment, but enough oxygen deficit to matter when combined with the substantial vertical gain. Higher altitude racing, comparable to SBT GRVL."

        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Racing through the Spanish Peaks region delivers backcountry Colorado adventure with towering peaks and expansive mesa views.

The elevation and remote location create wilderness exposure without being completely isolated."

The event draws \"more than a thousand\" riders \"from 46 states and nine countries\" but remains newer in Life Time's portfolio. Elite participation is growing but the race hasn't established deep historical prestige yet."

        "explanation": "Life Time's production shows through systematic course changes year-over-year and structured aid stations with clear timing.

Michelle Duffy Smith notes the \"exceptional experience\" created through collaboration with Trinidad community partners."

        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Racing through the Spanish Peaks region with expansive mesas as backdrop delivers Colorado high country experience. Trinidad offers 'rare, artistic and diverse culture' for post-race exploration. The technical loose gravel section on South Shore Trail near Trinidad Lake State Park breaks up what could be monotonous grinding."
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 3,

The field includes \"seemingly every type of rider, pros and amateurs alike\" with international participation. Competitive depth is growing but the newer event hasn't yet established the decades-deep talent pool of established races. Similar competitive depth to Rule of Three."

        "explanation": "Three distance options from $85-195 provide entry points for different commitment levels, while UNBOUND qualifier opportunities add value for series-focused riders. Trinidad's transformation into an outdoor recreation destination with \"newly established Office of Outdoor Recreation\" creates broader weekend value. The town's \"welcomed us with open arms\" approach enhances the overall experience beyond just race day."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Trinidad isn't a destination resort town, which keeps accommodation costs manageable compared to Aspen-type Colorado locations. However, no specific lodging or airport information available means you're researching logistics yourself. Southern Colorado location requires travel commitment for most riders but isn't as remote as some backcountry options. Similar expense level to Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

under 9\n000 feet got\nthe Spanish Peaks\npeeking out a bit from the clouds\ngot some Colorado wet Sunshine coming\ndown\nit's a full Buffet sampler of all the\nthings all the conditions all the\nsurfaces like sir Willie the wiener keep\nyour head up on the descents most of\nthem are fairly straightforward smooth\neasy to navigate but occasionally\nthere's a sharp corner that will sneak\nup on you here your garment or your\nwahoo is your friend if you can see\nSharp Corners coming out and of course\nyou know call things out to those you're\nriding with the roads are open so stay\nto the right of the road even though\nthere's hardly any traffic out here\noccasionally there is some so keep it to\nthe right especially on these blind\ncorners\nI asked Carolyn and Deanna and Alexi\nwhat they thought was the right tire for\nthis course I think you can get away\nwith something faster and narrower for\nsure\nlike 38 I think you could even\npotentially run in selects depending on\nthe\nroad conditions but yeah it's fast and\nthere's not a whole lot\nthat can mess you up out there\nother than a few sharp turns which got\nme\nright now\nhow many months out three four months\nout\nI was very happy with Tyler's eyes on\nit's kind of a semi-slick with\nlittle smooth patch down the middle and\nsome tread on the sides uh this is\ndefinitely a course I would look at\nrunning a slick it's that fast but you\ndefinitely have to baby some of those\nCorners just all of a sudden come around\nand it ends and you end up going into a\nbush and that is not conductive to going\nfascinating the Finish Line first so\num maybe play around like slick rear\nit's less like a little um like slick\nrear end\na little more cracked on the front yeah\nit kind of depends on like recent\nweather\num but I think the trend is\nwider\nor pressure so today I rode 38s though\nwhich is pretty narrow\num with like a Slicker section down the\nmiddle knobs on the sides but I would\nprobably lean towards\num like a similar style Tire just a just\na wider volume like bigger volume\nwe're riding this in early May and we\ngot all the weather we had\ngood heat good Sunshine some rain and\neven a little bit of hail\nthe same could happen on race day and\nfall so as always bring all the things\nat least to the start of the race then\nyou can pick and choose what you want to\ntake on race day it's always a good idea\nto have a shell when you're going up\nhigh in Colorado\nto wear a hydration pack or two knots\nwear a hydration pack that is the\nquestion\nhave to look at the Aid Station\nsituation but I think it's going to be\nfast and important to stay with other\npeople with the wind and just long long\nflat sections so I would probably bring\nhydration pack just to be able to keep\nrolling with your group hydration pack\nor no hydrogen pack\nuh I mean\nit's a hard one I think this race is\ngoing to be insanely fast and I don't\nthink there will be any feed Zone to the\nfront of the race so I will probably be\nrunning Hill back and two big bottles if\nyou're watching this asking yourself\nwhere the heck is Trinidad it is on the\nColorado New Mexico border just on the\nnorth side of Raton Pass you know\nnestled up against the Sangre de Cristos\nit's about three hours from Denver about\nthree and a half hours from Albuquerque\nand once you're out here you feel like\nyou're in the middle of nowhere\nin a positive way if you're wondering\nhow you can check out Trinidad outside\nof the red pop on over to the visitor\ncenter and pick up your gravel Adventure\nField Guide made by my man Juan De La\nRoca which as the name suggests is a\nguide to lots of rides around the area\nlifetime doesn't really want this to get\nout but I'll say it quietly while Ryan\nand Kim aren't looking I mean this\ncourse is created by Willie you know he\nwas we were following a snoop the whole\nday and let us let us the wrong way a\ncouple times but I think it's gonna be\npretty cool when you guys come race it\nit was fun it was super fast\num\nsmooth roads most of the way\num with yeah some just amazing views out\nin the middle of nowhere didn't see\nreally any cars or any other people\nwhich was super cool I think it's great\nyeah there's a lot of miles to separate\nsome groups\num but a lot of places where you want to\nstick together\num I thought generally the roads were\npretty smooth at points get a lot of\nfast sections uh and then kind of as\nyou're entering the second part of the\nloop there's some like super Rowdy\ndownhill sections and then it kind of\nleads to like flat sort of downhill\nreally fast areas so I think it'll be\nlike a really good course and like a\nsuper fast day on the bike\nyeah I mean I think this course has a\nlot of places you can split up um one\nthing I've kind of watched just on the\nweather is the wind can kind of come up\nout of nowhere so I think you kind of\nhave those climbs wear on you it's 100\nmiles 111 miles and you come over the\ntop and have a windy section and it'll\ngo kaboom\nthere are four elements I love about\ngravel racing there's the event itself\nthere's getting to explore the natural\nworld often in places you've never been\nbefore\nthere's exploring the town you know\noften these gravel races are held in\nsmall towns and Trinidad the host of the\nred is no exception it's a fun funky\ntown lots of good local businesses worth\nchecking out and spending the full\nweekend down here and the fourth thing\nof\nbattery it's getting to hang out with\npeople do any events getting to explore\nthe nature with them and then also\ngetting to check out the town of\nTrinidad the rat is September 30th I\nhope to see you here in Trinidad\noh the applesauce one is that um basmati\nrice\nbrown sugar what else gotta keep the top\nrunning organic apple sauce yams lemon\njuice sea salt they have Willy Wonka\ndown here\nforeign",

This will be our fifth year\ndoing this event. It only works with you\nhere. So, thank you very much for\njoining us. And thank you to the city of\nTrinidad for having us.\nTake your time. Enjoy this back country.\nGoing through that park is a pretty\nspecial thing. This is about something\nbigger than just ourselves. Let's take\ncare of each other out there. Have an\nawesome safe day.\n[Applause]\nIn general, what I like about the course\nhere is it's quote that champagne gravel\nmost of the time. It's almost a little\ndesert-like. I mean, there's a good bit\nof trees and stuff out in all the\ncourse, but it's dry and it's dusty.\nMost of the roads are gravel, hard\npacked, very fast, very flowy, very\nmoderate gravel.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's a little gnarly out there.\n[Music]\nFeels\nlike you're probably in southwest\nColorado as much as you are southeast.\n&gt;&gt; You guys got it.\nSo for five years now, we've been doing\nthis event and together working with the\ncommunity around what it means to bring\ngravel riding and growing it in this\narea.\nThe main street here, we've got a ton of\nbusinesses. We hope you will spend time\nin each and every one of them. Get to\nknow Trinidad. It is a cool place. We'd\nlove to have you check it out. Come\nback. Trinidad is such a cute little\ntown. You know, it's a great excuse to\ncome explore a local local area. It's\ngot a nice little main street, so I'm\nexcited to spend some time down here.\n&gt;&gt; This is a great gravel event. The\ncommunity is super supportive. You go\nget a coffee, they ask you if you're\nhere to race bikes or have fun. This\ntown is the most supportive of having an\nevent here and supportive of the\ncyclists. They just make it fun.\n&gt;&gt; And this is just kind of like down to\nearth lowkey. Everybody's talking to\neach other. Everybody's having a good\ntime. You're on the shakeout ride.\nEverybody's, you know, chilling, having\na good time, having conversations. So I\nthink that's just kind of the vibe that\nbrings here. probably used to had had\nits heyday a long time ago and it's\ntrying to bounce back and it's nice to\nbe able to come down and support, you\nknow, spend a little bit of money, spend\na little bit of time and just enjoy a\nreally neat uh downtown that's on its\nway back.",

of that climb after\n113 mil of racing the only only thing\nstanding in the way of the finish line\nis that last left hand turn on to Main\nStreet we're here at the fourth annual\nlifetime thead dirtfest here in Trinidad\nColorado we launched the rad in 2021 was\nour first year after a discovery phase\nin 2020 during covid when the big gravel\nboom was happening but there weren't\nevents taking place at that time and we\nwere looking for the next community that\nwe could invest in and make a difference\nwith together the rad belongs a trended\nad and the community stakeholders\nleadership and local businesses become\nour partners they show up to volunteer\nfor us and without their partnership\ntheir event can't take\nplace it's been a great economic boom\nand

suits me\nand I'm hanging on to faith at these\nlast two I'm going to climb the leader\nboard\nthis is going to be an awesome day of\nbike racing gravel racing here in\nTrinidad Colorado beautiful Spanish\nPeaks Grand M say these Racers are out\nfor a spectacular race in Southern\nColorado I couldn't agree more the rad\ndirt Fest is now the fifth stop in the\nlifetime Grand Prix and is looking to be\nhot from the\nstart before we get a look at the action\nlet's take a look at the lifetime Grand\nPrix leaderboard brought to you by SB\nafter their race in schaman the top\nthree men are Keegan and llin in first\nand second Cole and paac and tied for\nthird with 7066 and 62 points\nrespectively and behind them is Matt\nbeers and Alex wild to round out our top\nfive on the men's side on the

60\npoints and now we are only moments away\nfrom the next stop in the lifetime Grand\nPrix presented by Mazda we'll see I mean\nwe'll see very soon as we head out of\nthis steep start and I think it's going\nto be aggressive to the gun but I'll\nfind out very soon how do I get a\nsneaking feeling you guys are going to\nbe hanging out together today cuz we're\nbuddies we're Pals that's what even if\nyou're dying a thousand deaths out there\nyou just look over have some nice\nMountain views try to tone it down bit I\nthink people are hungry for points the\ntop 10 of the lifetime Grand Prix is\nreally close even the podiums up for\ngrabs\ngo and here we go the elite men are off\nand rolling with 110 mil of gravel\nbetween them and the finish line of the\nRat dirt fast taking a big old Punchy\nclimb here this thing's about 20 plus\nper this will set them up with some\nreally good visibility the group is\ntight there is a lot of energy in this\nthey are rolling into this chicane at a\nlittle bit around 20 M an hour and this\nis where it starts to really pay your\ndividends for pre- riding that\ncourse we're hearing some Riders may\nhave made contact as they are crossing\nthe damn\nroad a couple other Pros that tangled up\nwe got seven riders that were entrapped\nin this but nothing major just a touch\nto the bars we are roughly 6 miles in\nwhere the men will now go through\nTrinidad State Park and we will pick\nthem back up on the other side for now\nlet's take it back to the start line\nwhere our Elite women are waiting to\nstart their Journey towards the Spanish\nPeaks that surround Trinidad this is\ngoing to be an awesome day of bike\nracing gravel racing here in Trinidad\nColorado beautiful Spanish Peaks Grand\nMesa these Racers are out for a\nspectacular race in Southern Colorado\n6 5 4 3 2 1\ngo good morning from Trinidad Colorado\nwhere we are off and running with 113\nmiles of the stubborn Dolores course\ntoday over 10,000 FT elevation gain it's\ngoing to be a heated race out there\ntoday it will be a heated race indeed\nour Elite women are making their way\nthrough The Punchy downtown climb\nalready within the first miles leaving\ntown anah Hicks on the front pushing a\nfast pace already stringing out the\nfield here the elite women have now hit\nthe first section of gravel quickly\nmaking their way towards Trinidad State\nPark first selection is going to be the\ndouble track near Trinidad Lake we're a\ncouple of miles into the race right now\nonto the gravel cesy Decker's already\nbeen really kind of pushing the pace on\nthese descents a little bit\nas the women make their way through the\nstate park let's send it over to\nMichelle Duffy to take a look at what\nchallenges these Riders can expect from\nthe course today we start in downtown\nTrinidad Colorado and roll out onto\ngravel where the Riders then connect\nwith a trail on Trinidad Lake State Park\nthis is what we call a roller coaster\nit's a series of Hills across 6\nmiles and typically we expect to see the\npack kind of stay maintained there\nbefore they cross over the highway and\nbegin an 18m long climb up to 9,000 ft\nreaching grades of up to 18% at\ntimes the Riders then descend and then\nclimb up to the highest point at mile 65\nthen the course has a screaming descent\ndownhill for many miles and winds its\nway back to Trinidad Lake State Park\nwhere we expect to see some moves being\nmade but this is the area that's most\nsusceptible to flatting it is it's the\nchunkiest part of the course Riders then\nconnect back on to gravel SE ction that\nbrings them into town where they have a\nseries of very steep pavement Rolling\nHills into a screaming descent to the\nFinish\n[Music]\nLine we're catching back up with the\nmen's group coming out of Trinidad State\nPark with some of the faster Riders\nmoving to the front as we move into the\nnext section of the course Keegan\nSwinson just doing what he does best The\nMarked Man it's a pretty good course for\nme it's at altitude which is good you I\nalways like to ride ride I ride well at\naltitude and you know I'm from altitude\nand I'm just very familiar with it you\nknow there's a few other guys that are\nquite familiar with it and can ride well\nand you can know who to\nwatch the group got up to about 19\nRiders now 16 miles in some sort of a\ngroup going on up front now and Keegan\nis not in that group at the moment Alex\nis very smart tactically so that's\nthat's fun in the races like the rad\nwhere it's not just a fitness contest\nit's a it's a bit of a chess match this\nElite group of 20 Riders Pro men are now\nback together Keegan is just calm and\ncollected he knows what's in store he\nreally didn't burn any matches to try\nand close that down so we are starting\nour\nclimb trying to get a view of house Alex\nhouse who got off the front on this\nclimb the lead group cannot see him how\nis is a threat up here he's you know\nrelatively good at altitude and he's a\nreally experienced racer personally I\nlike to kind of poke the bear a little\nbit do it to them before they do it to\nyou you know we get to the rat and it's\nlike well you know okay let's play some\ngames right\nhere so as the men prepare to clear the\nAid Station let's check the leaderboard\nbrought to you by\nsbl as these Riders prepare to head to\nthe top of the Spanish Peaks Alex house\nis out in front with Kellen Peter and\nKeegan leading the\nchase let's check back in with the women\nas they are coming out of the state park\nand turning North onto Highway 12 so we\ngo across the pavement and we're\nstarting the gradual climb on the stick\nof the lollipop and nobody wanted to go\nto the front The Real L sitting up like\nstupid slow um and then a few people\nstarted to test the group see if anyone\nwould go Lauren went off the front\nlaa cenzo is the instigator of this pace\nand kind of closed it down and she did\nit a few times there are splits in the\ngroup people are trying to hold Wheels\nit is Dusty loose gravel roads right now\neveryone is still connected but again\nthose minor gaps and separations add up\nover the day our Elite women are now\napproaching the top of the big climb\naround mile 60 you just kind of feel it\nin your soul you know you're like this\nthis is the\ntime the moment of\nurgency all right Lauren dienzo has a\nbit of a gap off the front of this group\nAnna hick is up there Melissa Rollins up\nthere kind of trying to set Pace back to\nher she just keeps it going man it's so\nhard to stick with it and so none of us\ncould hang and she just gapped\nus as we started climbing more the pace\ngot gradually harder and people started\nto fall off the group started to dwindle\nLauren de crescenzo is pushing hard and\nlast we heard she had about a 1 and A2\nminute gap on the rest of the field we\nare only 40 mil into this race will she\nbe able to hang on to that Gap going up\nthe longest climb of the\n[Applause]\nday I feel the race really begins in the\nsecond half in those big\nclimbs so as the women make it through\nthe mile 43 aid station let's take a\nlook at the leaderboard brought to you\nby sbl we still have Lauren de crescenzo\npushing the pace out front with a group\nof 10 behind her this group includes\nSophia Melissa Rollins Sarah Sturm and\nPaige onweller just to name a few we're\npicking it back up with the men after\nthe big climb and Alex's Gap has been\nclosed Keegan has now kind of commanded\nthe group here and brought in Griffin\nwith him and you can also see Pete STNA\nsitting right there with Griffin Brenda\nJohnson hydration pack ready to\ngo Alex house had some sort of a\nmechanical uh looking down at the\ndrivetrain and check it out the\ndefending Champion Alexi bermon has\nbridged up enough to be able to see the\nleading eight in front on this climb but\nhe's just pulling over right now so\nlet's see what Alexi has going on front\ntire oh my God the worst timing ever for\nAlexi back up with the lead group here\nit looks like STNA just finished with\nhis pole putting it back on Keegan\nKeegan Not Afraid today to do his fair\nshare Griffin Easter just sitting pretty\nall day long with the power absolutely\nmatching every move that needs to be\nmade oh what a bummer to see Finn here's\nFinn also dropping off the pace it looks\nlike our Elite men are approaching the\ntop of the climb around M\n60 Brendan Johnson seems to be uh the\none that's uh Pace setting this second\nChase group out on the course it's a\nfunny racing that we get to the top and\nthen we Plum it back down and that's two\nhalves of the race um and I like that\nSlow Burn from the start to the top of\nthe hill it creates different Dynamics\nin the group and there's lulls and yeah\nit really starts to set in as you get\ntowards the top and then I think the\ngroup that goes over the top is the one\nthat goes to the Finish\nPeter STNA out front and he's on the\ncanyon with also Griffin Easter on a\ncanyon maybe even perhaps some sort of a\nteammate alliance with Canyon here it's\nsuch a high point after a lot of\nclimbing I think if you're not in the\nfront you need to be with a very\nmotivated group and close it's kind of\njust 1% downhill where that's that's\nlike your Matt beers types can just roll\na big gear and if you're in the front\nyou have to be motivated and have a lot\ncohesion to work together to maintain\nwhat you've\ncreated let's take a look at Matthew\nBeer's data from his Gman devices as we\nwatch him pushing it on the tarmac it's\nimpressive how he's able to hold such a\nhigh average\npower if I'm in a group and it is suited\nto my you know 1% just letting it eat I\nam the guy that everyone looks at I take\npride in that but also not burn my\nmatches as the men continue their\ndescent back into town let's take a look\nat the leaderboard presented by\nsbl at the 81 mile Mark Peter is holding\non in front with Griffin and Keegan\nclose\nbehind and Matthew beers and Brendan\nJohnston round out the top\nfive as we catch back up with the women\nafter the biggest climb of the day let's\nhear what Lauren Hall is seeing out on\ncourse all right just getting a good\nlook at Lauren right now with a\nsignificant Gap she's got over a 3 and 1\nhalf minute lead right now on Chase\ngroup looking really good you know like\nthis lady knows how to suffer like\nnobody else I like riding so\nwell it's one of my favorite things to\ndo just H go for a Lauren ride for four\nto five hours that's what I do all the\ntime this is the chase group they are 4\nand a half minutes down on laurenda\ncenzo sopia is driving the pace of this\ngroup and she's dropping CES Decker and\nMelissa Rollins right now this is a bit\nof a stair step climb before they go\nback towards the lake as this group\nattempts to cover the Gap to Lauren de\ncrescenzo let's take a quick look at\nAlexis scara's Garmin data to see what\nit takes to get over these Punchy\nclimbs will these three be able to keep\npushing the pace and Bridge up to Lauren\nthis has been a race of attrition all\nday for the entire field I have nothing\nto lose I'm not going for the overall in\nthe Grand Prix anymore I'm just going\nfor individual wins I mean I got a\nbackup plan I could always go back to\nwork so nothing to lose any day I just\nwant to go out there and have a good\ntime Sarah is pushing forward dropping\nSES sopia meanwhile is up ahead sitting\non Alexa's wheel and constantly looking\nback we were able to make a gap on Sarah\non the\ndesense let's see if CES can continue\nher push forward towards Sophia and\nAlexis you always wonder like if I was a\nbetter descender was able to be with the\nchase group behind Lauren I guess would\nI be able to have duked it out at the\nend here comes Alexa Sophia and who made\nit back cesy Decker made it back holy\ncow great riding by\nthem Lauren dienzo getting a sense for\nhow she's doing up here solo been solo\nfor most of the day about mile 30 she\nbasically rode off the front of the\ngroup it's definitely wearing on her but\nthis is nothing new for laurena cenzo we\nare back on pavement with our Chase\ngroup of three but it looks like the day\nmay be done for cesal Decker the top\nfour women have now crossed the timing\nmat around mile 81 let's take a look at\nhow the rest of the race is shaking up\nwith our leaderboard brought to you by\nSLI we still have LDC with over a\n4-minute gap Sophia and Alexis are\nchasing and starting to drop C Decker\nand Sarah Lang behind them the race is\nstarting to spread out let's head back\nover to the men to find out how this\nrace is going to shake out Keegan Peter\nand Griffin have broken away from the\npack as they continue this descent into\ndowntown Trinidad it is truly a\nspectacular performance with this lead\ngroup they are putting in so much effort\nand making it look easy today separating\nthemselves from the remainder of the 60\nplus professionals that started the rad\ntoday hey beat's a good bike racer you\nknow uh especially at a race like this\nlike a lot of climbing altitude and you\nCoast a little bit off the top of the\nDescent but then it's like 1 to 2%\ndownhill so you're just like in a big\ngear going fast trying to stay small and\narrow and you know it's a nice Draft\nwhen you're in the wheel but when you're\nin the wind it's you to push quite hard\nto like keep the pace high it was\nGriffin Keegan and myself and I was\nlicking my lips a little bit just\nbecause this was the best case scenario\nfor me and Griff two Canyon sponsored\nriders with Keegan we finally have the\nnumber advantage and we needed to\nmanipulate that the idea is one goes and\nteammate in the moment if you will\nliterally plays poker and says like n\nKeegan you can you can do it I'm going\nto sit on and then if Keegan does commit\nand bring him back the next one goes and\nideally you do that a couple times and\neventually Keegan's just chasing the\nwhole time and he\nbreaks Griff was hurt and he tried\nfirst made Keegan accelerate once I kind\nof dropped off the back for that Hill\ntook a run at\nhim I knew they were going to start\nplaying some games at the bottom of that\nclimb and I saw him chatting I was like\nI bet Griffin will launch first and\ncover that then you know Pete went and\nthen cover Pete to his credit he knew\nwhat was happening tried man like you\nhave to try so proud of that race I knew\nme the course you do me well and uh you\nknow just came in to try and handle\nbusiness and get it done so there you\nhave it Keegan holds off the late push\nto take the top spot with Peter coming\nin second and Griffin holding on to\nthird Matthew beers came in fourth and\nBrendan Johnson rounded out the top\nfive oh man I was a little better but\nthis race is hard and if you don't make\nit over the over the top in the front\nthen yeah it's hard to get back here's\nthe leaderboard brought to you by sbl\nfor the rest of the men's field Finn\ngullixson comes in sixth Kellen Caldwell\nin seventh Julian gang in eighth Henry\nNelson in nth and Russell finsterwald\nrounds out the top 10 Alex wild landed\nin 11th Kyle Trudeau in 12th and early\nleader Alex how ended up in\n14th and now we head back over to the\nwomen last we heard LDC was out to a\nsubstantial lead let's check back in as\nthese athletes have their sights set on\nthe Finish Line all right you guys we\nare here at the Trinidad Lake trying to\nget a bead on Lauren de cenzo coming in\nwe're just checking out our Garmin right\nhere just to get a sense of how soon\nshe's going to be to us but it's\nessentially Lauren should have this\nwrapped up coming into the finish a\nsignificant Gap coming back into\nTrinidad and now we see Sophia and\nAlexis scarta have exited the state park\nwithout cesal in sight it seems they\nreally pushed the pace through that\nsection and have opened up their Gap\neven more but the question remains do\nthey have enough in the tank to catch\nLauren de crescenzo before the finish of\nthe Rat dirt\nFest to save something in the tank for\nthis 30 to 45 second clown right here at\nthe end of 1133 mile\nday oh man just the telling signs on\ntheir legs on their face their body\nthere's just salt all over their\nkit the end is really tough because it's\neasy to settle right it's easy to be\nlike it's not worth it I'm just going to\ntake it back a notch because I'm hurting\nso much and and like when you've been\nRacing for 6 hours I think it's easier\nto kind of think that way oh but wait\nthere's\nmore oh man people are walking their\nbikes up here it's\nbrutal oh my gosh come on you guys\nyou're really going to put this right\nback at the finish of this race holy cow\nLauren is now making her way around the\nfinal turns and pushing towards the\nFinish Line she is almost back to the\nred brick roads of downtown Trinidad and\nlooks to still have over four minutes on\nSophia and\nAlexis what a phenomenal day for Lauren\nto\nwining every time she races here at the\nrad let's welcome Lauren the\ncenzo a rough few last races but this\njust uh this just feels really\ngood Sophia has really good punch at the\nend of races I think she's able to\nattack when everyone's feeling tired and\nshe knows when people are tired and she\nattacks at the right moment CES is\ncoming hard right here there she goes\nright now up the climb trying to make it\nback and there is CES Decker passing\nAlexis scarta putting herself into third\nposition she has been fighting all day\nlong and it is coming down to the wire\nand it looks like Sophia will just be\nable to hold off cesal for a second\nplace finish cesal comes across the line\nin third with Alexis scarta finishing\nforth good\njob it has been an amazing day of racing\nfor what is the fifth stop of the\nlifetime Grand Prix presented by\nMazda here is today's leaderboard for\nthe rest of the field brought to you by\nsbl\nMelissa Rollins hangs on for fifth with\nSarah Lang taking sixth P John Weller in\nseventh Aaron Huck Anna Hicks and Sarah\nSturm will round out our top 10\nrespectively Whitney Allison takes 11th\nHaley Smith and 12th followed by Cecile\nEmily and\nCaroline now let's go to the Finish Line\nwhere the Riders have gathered to\ncelebrate a great day of\nracing what collar bone who needs the\ncollar\nbone it's almost\nsealed I was like dude the only way we\ncan do something in Canyon they'd be\npissed if we didn't like we got to one\nto them you know honestly I'm just super\nhappy on the day um I think I locked up\nthe Grand Prix\noverall I'm in pain I'm tired I want to\nsleep disappointed but also like proud\nof myself for doing it and being out\nhere and being close\nPete has said well it's got a bit of a\nroad racing VI but it's also hard in the\nend I think you know the strongest guys\nwill always kind of rise to the top I\njust it just felt right at the time I\nwas like you know what now I think\nthat's what's so like addictive about\nthis as you walk away from a race and\nyou're like these are the things I did\nwell and these are the things that I can\nimprove and you just kind of Come Away\nwith this list and I think it lights a\nlittle bit of a fire and with another\nrace down here's your sbl

you something to believeing\nwell hello everyone Joe GTO here and\nwelcome to Trinidad Colorado um we're\ndown here for the rad dirt Fest gravel\nrace presented by Wahu it's the six of\nseven stops in a lifetime Grand Prix I\njust got done riding the first kind of\nreal dirt section yeah it's going to go\nKaboom right there and then so backing\nup the course is 11 12ish miles on the\nmap it looks like it's a lot of climbing\nbut it's the word is it's pretty mellow\num all I did was this first section out\nhere so I don't really know what the\nwhole course is like however word on the\nstreet is that the gravel is pretty darn\nfast so on my coach's advice I've\nswitched over to some slicks they kind\nof got a texture to them um they're the\nMaxis\nvelocitas that's the only change I made\nto this bike since the other races and\nthey're surprisingly comfy more traction\nthan I thought I was going to have so\nthey're pretty smooth over the rough\nterrain Roxy come here Roxy hey you come\nhere well Trail Dog Roxy here hates the\ncar rides but she loves getting out and\nexploring a little bit so didn't you do\nthat yeah are you\ntired yeah have we been driving for 2\ndays yeah well you're just the cutest\nisn't she the cutest dog yeah I know\nthere's more dogs in the uh the cycling\nscene one particular weener dog I know\nabout that's pretty famous but little\nart can hold her own look at look at how\ncute she\nis race day morning how's Kenny doing\nmuch better it's not 4:00\na.m. good morning it's race day\nSeptember 30th morning of the rad dirt\none thing I like about the rad starts at\n9:00 so it's currently 6:15 right now\nnot\n4:15 um so yeah I'm enjoying my Bob's\nRed Mills gluten-free pancake with some\neggs that I had pre-made the other day\nso all I had to do is heat it up in the\nmicrowave got a banana and of course\n100% Pam map syrup that's breakfast\nwe're going to get you some coffee oh\nyeah your Hat's slightly\ncing there we go is that better yeah I\nthink my eyes are crooked cuz I always\nwear my hat like that and I think it's\nstraight but apparently is this straight\nnow yeah or still crooked it's more\nstraight more straight there that's good\nyeah see now it feels crooked so I'm\npretty sure I've got crooked\nface yeah\n[Applause]\nn\nhere we are about a mile into this race\num as you can see it's been a little bit\nof a hectic start on the little town\ncircuit bike path they had us go out on\nthey had some lead motos so they were\nholding their speed back um but it was\njust a fight for position as it got so\nnarrow so quick right here they are\nreleasing us from neutral so we're free\nto race and at Mile 3.8 there is a\nlittle choke point where we go between\ntwo fences and only a single Rider can\nget through at a time everybody knows\nthis so we're all trying to be right at\nthe front right at that spot which is\ngoing to make for some pretty nervous\nracing through this next two miles or so\nwell that was intense while it's sad to\nsee someone go down I felt like that\ncrash was a little bit inevitable having\nthe men and women start together I just\ndon't know if it's the best idea anymore\njust the level's so high and the guys\nare so aggressive that things are going\nto happen um looking back at the crash\nit was two guys up ahead that I believe\nhooked bars and Nathan went down in\nfront of Ruth um who also then went down\nand she's the one laying on the ground\nhere that broke her wrist so super sad\nto see as she was pretty high up in the\nlifetime Grand priest standings back to\nwhere I'm at now um coming out of that\npinch point I was sitting on Ian's wheel\nand it just so happened that he was the\none where that split really happened\nwith the front group so I'm sitting in\nno man's land between group one and\ngroup two um so you might think it's a\nbetter option just to sit up and go back\nto the next group but I prro this and\nnot far up the road is the next Jeep\nTrail that is going to go down to single\nfile in sections and I really don't want\nto get caught by the group behind me and\ngoing at the back so I do ease up and\nluckily that group split apart a little\nbit and just Griffin and Cole come past\nme here so I'm able to hook right on the\nback of them then go into this fourwh\nthe trail with some pretty good speed\nand catch right back onto the tail end\nof The League group so while I did have\nto burn some matches to stay you know\nkind of on my own through that section\nI'm better off being where I'm at now\noh\nso we're partway through this Jeep Trail\nhere and I'm definitely starting to see\nsigns that I'm not on my best day as I'm\nstruggling a bit to hold the wheel of\nGriffin being at the back of this pack\nevery time we go up and down a hill\nthere is an accordion effect and it gets\nstretched out and then we have to kind\nof surge a little bit to get back on the\ngroup that's not making things easier my\nheart rate's been above 170 since the\nclimb going into the inch point and I'm\nhitting in the 180s here which is above\nthreshold for me so I know I'm\ndefinitely going a little too deep right\nhere but trying to stay with the group\nis still a priority hoping that it'll\nchill down once we get a little bit\nfurther out of this Trail and over the\nuh paved Hill coming up\nhere we are at Mile 9 and2 we are just\nat the start of about a 4minute climb\nthis part of the race I was actually\nlooking forward to before starting\nhowever I'm just completely gassed after\nthe effort through the Jeep Trail and\ndon't have it in me to stay with this\nlead group here I take a look back and\nsee there's another group coming so I\ndecided to Pace this a little bit slower\nhop in that group and Hope hopefully we\nwill chase back together so first Rider\nto come by me here is Cole uh but he's\nmoving a little too quick for me trying\nto get up to that group so I stand up\nand wait just a little bit\nfurther next we have ad Ro bear and\nsomeone else here and we're near in the\nflatter part of the climb so I think\nthese would be the guys that I can try\nand stick to unfortunately just a little\nbit further we hit another Riser and I\nfall off Adam's wheel and the other guy\nhere so I revert to the next couple guys\ncontaining Carrie Warner Jack odron and\na Tre bear Rider we come over the top of\nthis hill and these end up being the\nguys that I could stick with as we head\ndown the\nhill come\nover don't fight how you really\nBelieve come\nfeel come closer please closer please\nI'll give you something to\nbelieve all I really need a little\nmotivation to pull you from the other\nside what I need to show you is my\nobligation how much longer can you\nhide you can try and push away from me\nyou kick and scream you're begging\nplease but once you get a little taste\nof Freedom you want to get up your KNE\nFe come closer to me closer to I'll give\nyou something to\nbelieve it come\nfeel come closer please closer\nI'll give you something to believe\nman I'm going to give this section a big\nMinnesota statement of UA it's been\nslightly uphill with a Tailwind so\nthat's diminishing the draft and we have\nbeen chasing what feels to me like super\nsuper hard the groups were kind of\nsplitting apart people were breaking off\nthe front falling off the back so like\nthe chasing wasn't super cohesive and I\njust feel like I've been on my limit\npretty much since that Hill if we look\nat the last 55 minutes of racing or so\nI've been at an average heart rate of\n173 hitting 181 so that's well into my\nthreshold the power here isn't too crazy\nyou know 295 watt average with a 322\nnormalized which normally isn't too bad\nbut here at altitude and feeling like\nI'm not on the best day it's it's felt\npretty darn tough for me Carrie had\nactually dropped off the back and I saw\nthat and I was thinking about falling\noff and just trying to ride consistent\nPace with him because I knew I was going\ntoo deep however we can start to see the\nlead group in the background actually\nand I'm thinking if I can just hang on\nand we can catch them there's a chance\nthat I can get my heart rate down and\nrecover a little bit then have the\nbenefit of being in that group\nmy time here at the front is super\nshortlived as I fall off the group on\nthis kicker at the top of this first\nlong false flag climb um My Hope of\nsitting in the group and recovering just\ndidn't happen um the pace actually was\nstill pretty quick and with that\nTailwind I just didn't have much of a\nchance to rest yeah um just didn't have\nit on the\nday hey hey John up there what oh yeah I\ndidn't quite make it and then I made it\nand then it got steep again a little bit\nfurther on the race I get caught by John\nbran and another Rider here and this is\nthe first time I can tell that I'm in\nreally big trouble as I try and stay\nwith him and I just have zero gas in the\ntank I don't have anym help sorry I just\ncan't help I'm a little\nblown and now I'm kind of sitting in no\nman's land in between groups and really\nstruggling in hindsight looking back at\nhow I played out this race of course we\ncan say I went too hard in the beginning\nand blew up which when you do that at\naltitude you can really pay the serious\nprice which I'm doing right now yeah\nmight have been better just to calm down\nway back and find a group that was a\nlittle bit more manageable pace and ride\nthis race consistent however my goal\nisn't to ride consistently for 30th\nPlace you know I want to be up here\nfighting with these guys and you just\nyou have to go for it if you want to\nhave a chance at getting a good\nall I knew going into this that my\nracing at altitude hadn't been the best\nwith crusher being my worst race of the\nseason so far but I still holding up\nhope that I could do all right I live in\nSalt Lake at 4700 ft so I do live at a\ncertain amount of altitude but this year\nit's been pretty tough tough anytime I\nget above 7,000 ft which we're kind of\nhitting right here so from here on out\nit just kind of switched my focus to\nsurvival mode\nno\nhere we are at Mile 45.5 as we turn on\nto the next major climb in this race I\nfind myself actually in a pretty nice\ngroup again finding Carrie Warner to\nride with not too long into The Climb I\nstill realize that I'm pretty much\nbonked and just kind of hold on for as\nlong as I can cuz there is a little bit\nof wind here so I am getting a bit of a\ndraft and hoping that I can just kind of\nget myself a little further along versus\nuh riding by myself for longer maybe a\nthird into this climb I fall off wasn't\nthe first one out of this group to fall\noff which felt good but still just uh\nnot having my day as we go further up\nthe climb my power continues to go down\nbarely able to hold 200 Watts so not\neven my zone 2 power and I actually get\ncaught by the lead woman right here now\nI know I'm totally bonked but not going\nto lie this is a bit embarrassing I've\nnever been caught by the woman before I\nknow they're super strong so having an\noff day um of course there's a chance of\nthat happening but still just a huge\nbummer what I'm feeling right now is I I\njust don't want to be here um yeah just\nis what it is all that's left to do is\npedal whatever wattage is going to come\nout of my legs and try and get back to\nthe Finish as fast as possible to kind\nof end the misery what this bad day is\nyou guys have like Coke or Sprite or\nanything\nperfect you want this is picker fill up\nyes takes a little time there like\nPerfect all right thank you happy trail\nas I make my way back down the mountain\nI find a companion to ride with for a\nlittle bit here slowly I feel the power\nstarting to come back in my legs we\nactually run into Melissa another female\nRider out of Salt Lake and she was out\nof water so being that my race was over\nI was more than happy to hand her what I\nhad and then I just stopped and get at\nthe next stage\nstation from\nhere take a look around you everything's\nbrighter can you\nsee a good rest of your eyes and don't\nlook down now let's just be here you and\nme this\nWonderland it belongs to\nus you will\nsee I'm flying so high off the\nground I'm way up\nhere and I just can't\ncome it's me and Roxy hanging out at the\nlast a station the wind is definitely\npicking up I put some ice in his bottles\nI've got one Coke one water and then\nfrom here it's going to be 5 miles to\nthe Finish it's a fun little downtown\nMain Street area um hopefully he'll want\nto eat some barbecue or pizza or tacos\nor something those are kind of the\noptions down there that's about all I\nknow I've had no service to see any\nupdates since I saw him last so we're\njust chilling\nhey honey sorry about that I just I have\nzero power above 7,000 I\nuh I know I know I going do it I love\nyou\neverywh f high so\nhigh everywhere we go feel so Li we fly\nso high so high\na up here oceans full of bright flow\ndiamonds how they\nshine Crystal Clear living in the state\nof M all the\ntime all right so we just finished up\nthe rad not not going to lie probably\none of the worst races that I've ever\nhad I just had no power above 7,000\n8,000 ft today so I just kind of noodled\nalong and then as soon as I got back\ndown to maybe under 7,000 ft all the\npower just came back and I was able to\njust ride pretty hard in honor of racing\nyou know you want to come out here you\nwant to try your best so I pushed pretty\nhard to the Finish\nbut yeah just just a tough day and I\nthink I've learned at least for this\nyear I just am not good at these high\naltitude climbing races um see if a\nbigger block over the winter helps out\ncuz I'd like to do better at these races\num but I think move forward until I show\nthat I can do better at these we're\ngoing to focus on um some of the other\nstyles shorter Hills trying to stay\nunder 6,000 ft uh stuff like that all\nright well that is a wrap\non the rad\nnext up we'll be at uh Belgian waffle\nride Kansas um that one suits me a lot\nbetter again I got two weeks so I got a\nlittle time to just kind of let the body\nand the the mental side of things from\nthis race calm down try and get in the\nbest form i c for that race and yeah\nwe'll see you there little\nr little girl you're so good to see you\noh so good",
