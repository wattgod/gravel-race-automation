I\nhaven't got a gravel bike but I won't\nlet you\ndown and here we were 6 months later in\ncla's home soaking up the local\ntown and for me the first time ever\nsigning on for a bike race getting my\nrace number and timing chip from the\nlovely\n[Music]\nVolunteers in the end it's right I hope\nyou have a Time of Your\nLife race day a lovely sunny morning\naround 20 Celsius\nwe knew that in the afternoon it was\ngoing to be in the\nmid-30s the ride started at 8:00 so we\nwould be back before the real heat of\nthe day kicked in Mr\nbman there he is on film and there was\nCory Barkman come to join in and hang\nout it was so lovely to see him the\nfirst really fast if you're not used to\nride in a pack you know maybe just give\nyourself some more space the grael and\nmy friend Bob to go on our lovely gravel\nbikes all right guys enjoy your day have\nfun have\n[Applause]\nfun a good\nday it was a pretty special feeling\ngoing off down that gravel I wasn't\nnervous so much as super excited for a\nbig day out on the bike\nwe were absolutely loaded with food and\nwater prepared to be self-sufficient but\nknowing we had an aid station at our\nturnaround\nPoint heading out Barb and I had the\noption of riding either the 60 km Rodeo\nride or if we felt good when we got to a\njunction way up the road we could turn\nleft and carry on for the full rustler\ndistance but we really wanted to ride\nthe\nrustler oh that's a beautiful shot\nstraight down the road all the bikes\nlaned\nout Barb's got a lot of racing\nexperience behind her and we knew that\nwe could do the distance with we trained\nhard for it all spring but we weren't\nthere to win prizes we were there for a\nbig day out riding our bikes in\nbeautiful countryside and having a\nbrilliant time on this absolutely\nincredible gravel course it was in\nperfect\ncondition my prep over the long cold\nCalgary Winter was to ride on zwift\nwithout door riding as soon as the ice\nwas gone from the paths and I added\nweights and pilates and some yogur in\nfront of the T and it's all on straa so\nit all\ncounts as soon as we could get outside\nBarb and I rode as much gravel around\nCalgary as possible we have a couple of\nfavorite rides that we would head to and\nwe started up in the distance getting in\nsome very hot 4-Hour\nrides when dinosaurs rule the\nEarth I had this almost romantic Vision\nthat this is a landscape where dinosaurs\nhad died their bodies buried now deep in\nthe coolies\nAlberta is very fossil rich and the\nshape of the land feels\nancient I think the training prepared me\nvery well to do this though of course I\nwish I could have gone faster\nsh really down\nI also knew the sort of pace I thought I\ncould aim for working for my heart rate\nzones anticipating how my body would\nfeel and I came up with a Target time I\nexpected to be back within about 5 and\n1/2 hours maximum\nit was a really hot day there had been\nplans earlier in the week to shorten the\nrace because it was going to be so hot\ndangerously hot but the day before we\nheard that the original course was back\non Barb and I had talked beforehand\nabout how the very hot day might impact\nour decision making would we do the\nshorter Rodeo or would we ride the\nrustler as we'd hoped coming up to our\nJunction I saw Bobb look back at me turn\nher bike left and I knew at that point\nshe felt good and she was committed to\nthe rustler I was thrilled\nbir cre R 8 Miles that's where we're\ngoing most of the race was ridden over\npublic gravel roads they were really\nquiet and the traffic was mainly\nmarshalling Vehicles going back and\nforth checking on all the Riders\nby riding the rustler we were able to\naccess a private road onto a working\nRanch Burke Creek Ranch and it's only\navailable for this very special one day\nof the\nyear and here we go this is our prize\ndown this super fast Hill onto the ranch\nand there it all is stretching out in\nfront of us pristine Alberta Grassland\nI dreamed about all of this for a couple\nof years really since I first learned\nabout this race of being out here in\nthis Countryside having this experience\nriding on this\nland there are Riders belting back past\nme they're coming off of the 122 km full\nrange course yep green badge that person\nhad ridden the range and they were\nreally\nmoving orange badge like mine they're\nriding the rustler many of the bikes\nwere like mine using a 2 by setup and\nmost people had a couple of water\nbottles and a hydration pack\nI was drinking about 3/4 of a liter per\nhour eating bars and homemade rice cakes\non the way out and boy were they good\nreally kept the furnace\nstoked I was so glad I had this gorgeous\ndownhill all to myself the valley\nscenery was just opening up around me\nthis was a feature that I was really\nlooking forward to the river crossing we\nonly had one wet river crossing the\nother one was dry here comes the\nfootbath I was heading for my exit point\nbut the front wheel got knocked off\ncourse by a rock right at the\nedge I love saying hey bells in fields\nit makes me happy I grew up in the\ncountry and I rode land like this on my\npony There's real joy in seeing that\nfeed being prepared for the winter it\nmakes me think of all the farmers I've\never known how hard they worked and just\nhow important the work\nis the fabulous volunteers who looked\nafter us are mostly experienced bike\nriders too\nthey knew exactly what to do Coke chips\nand dipping our bike helmets into ice\nwater it was so\ngood this is the wall it's a real Beast\neven many of the really good cyclists\nwere going to be walking it it's a\nkilometer long and it maxes out at\n177% just like that on the way back\nthat was kind of the beauty of doing the\nrustler course for me the intermediate\ndistance we didn't have to face the wall\nin that\nheat having slogged through 5 hours of\nriding in what felt like 34 Cel it might\nsound strange to say I would love to do\nit again and I would love to ride the\nlong course to challenge myself going\nover the wall when I met up with Barb at\nthe a station I was pretty thrilled when\nshe told me we'd actually made it there\nbefore the posted cut off time in order\nto take the long\ncourse I hadn't even thought about that\nas a girl it was a pretty sweet surprise\nthe reality though is that the extra 40\nkm loop on the long course is really\ntough and there's another thousand M of\nclimbing to\ndo\na now we\nclimb so much of challenging myself to\nride this event was about learning what\nmy body is capable of now and part of\nlearning to trust it again after breast\ncancer\nit was so great descending on my Grizzle\nit felt so shooted as if it knew the way\nit handled beautifully super responsive\nand comfortable I absolutely love that\nbike it was set up tubeless with 45 mil\npelli centur H Tires I think those tires\nwere perfect for that course in that\ncondition and for other bike nerds the\ntire pressures were 30 PSI at the rear\nand 29 at the front and my chain was\nwaxed obviously\nthe climb out of the ranch averaged\naround 11% and I knew I should keep\nsomething back for that it actually went\nsurprisingly well I was up it before I\nknew it puffing but I stuck to my plan\nof not going too deep into the red\nthe gravel roads were in such great\nshape they were so fast rolling I think\nG starts the organizer called it hero\ngravel I like\nthat the trans Rockies truck passed us\nquite a few times during the day they\ndid an excellent job there were a lot of\nvehicles going backwards and forwards\nchecking on the course and the Riders\nmaking sure there weren't serious\nMechanicals or people in difficulty the\nride felt so well supported\non the way back and getting passed by\nSpeedy Riders they've been out on the\nlong course and are going like hell and\nthey're going to get back way before me\nbut you know what I didn't care I was\njust so happy to be out\nthere I couldn't call it racing because\nit was really just about being out there\nand that's why I chose to stop and take\nsome\nvideo it's almost like I woke up about\n15 km from the finish and just had this\nfeeling of it's nearly over and I didn't\nwant it to be over\nCrossing that line was incredibly\nemotional I was so joyful I'd had a\nlittle moment when I let out a sort of\nPrimal whale all on my own just out of\nsheer Joy somewhere around 5 Corners\nfrom the end when I realized oh my god\nI've nearly done it I'm actually here I\ntrained I committed and I did\nit is this going to\nend I was pretty glad to get back and\nshare some hugs to congratulate Bobb for\nbeing speedier than me and have a really\nlong drink and start eating all the\nsnacks but I still didn't want it to be\nover I loved it I'm so grateful to have\ndone it I'm so thankful for all the\nsupport that got me here for the amazing\norganization at the event for the\nprivilege of taking\npart and really just for being alive the\nopportunity to be out there there on the\nland living out all the preparation and\nlearning more about how to nurture\nmyself it was an incredible experience\nand it was over far too\nfast you don't have to make it\nwe nothing's going to stop you just\nbeing the way you\nare nothing's going to change the way\nnever come\ndown never come\ndown never come down",
