Riders report starting in light jerseys then getting hammered by rain and sleet, with temperatures dropping 5-10°C from coastal forecasts as you climb toward the mountains. The constant wind drives what locals call 'light rain' but feels like getting sandblasted, and weather forecasts are essentially useless for planning."

Gear requirements compound costs since cmscat50 learned \"biggest tires possible will help\" after puncturing with 38mm tires, while others invested in suspension forks after experiencing the washboards. Many riders camp to control accommodation costs, but the specialized equipment demands and remote location make this a significant financial commitment."
