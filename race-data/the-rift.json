        "explanation": "200km (124mi) with ~2,600m climbing. Also offers 100km option. The terrain makes it feel longer—washboard sections and river crossings slow average speeds significantly. Budget 10-15+ hours for most riders."

        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Volcanic gravel is 'sharper in nature' than typical gravel. Washboard sections are notorious—'literally grind us to almost a complete stop.' Five river crossings require dismounting and walking through 5°C glacial water. Not smooth."

        "score": 5,

        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Fly into Keflavik, bus to Reykjavik, then free shuttle to Hvolsvöllur. Car rentals expensive. Event offers free camping at the start. Remote location means planning required—no bike shops in the highlands."

      "summary": "The Rift is gravel racing on another planet. The volcanic landscapes of Iceland's interior—lava fields, black sand, glacier-fed rivers—create visuals unlike any other race. It's less a race and more an expedition through terrain that shouldn't exist. The weather will test you (cold, wind, possible sleet in July), the washboard will beat you, and the river crossings will soak you. But finishing means you rode across the tectonic rift between continents.",

      "reality": "The washboard sections around 50-80km are described as 'super brutal, literally grind us to almost a complete stop.' After 2023, many riders installed suspension forks—one joked about 'knocking someone off their bike to take their Lauf.' The 5 river crossings often require walking—'my notion of riding them all was quickly dispelled by the first crossing.' Volcanic gravel is sharper than normal and destroys tires.",
      "consequences": [
        "Washboard sections shake bottles loose and rattle bikes apart",
        "River crossings in 5°C water followed by 14°C air—wet feet for hours",
        "Sharp volcanic rock requires tubeless with plug kit AND spare tubes"
      ],
      "expectation_reset": "Run 42-50mm tires with serious sidewall protection. Strongly consider a suspension fork (Lauf True Grit is not coincidentally common). Carry multiple repair options—it's 'very remote' and help is distant. Wear wool socks or quick-dry footwear for river crossings. Accept that the washboard will slow you dramatically."
