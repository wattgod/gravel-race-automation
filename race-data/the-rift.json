        "score": 5,

        "score": 4,

        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Getting to Hvolsvöllur means flying into Reykjavik then driving 90 minutes south, which isn't terrible but adds complexity. The race caps fields at around 250 riders in a country with zero bike shops in the interior, so if your gear fails spectacularly, you're walking home. Five mandatory river crossings where you'll likely dismount and wade through 5°C water means extra kit planning for hypothermia prevention."
      },
      "length": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "At 124 miles, this sits in that brutal middle ground—long enough to destroy undertrained riders but not quite epic enough to be a true sufferfest. The 200km official distance translates to serious time in the saddle across volcanic wasteland where every mile feels harder than normal pavement. One Reddit user warned 'the 200 is brutal and it doesn't let off,' which tells you everything about the psychological toll of this distance on this terrain."
      },
      "technicality": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "The volcanic gravel is 'sharper in nature' than typical glacial gravel, demanding tubeless setups and spare everything because you're in the middle of nowhere. Five water crossings at 0.5 wheel depth across 5-10 meter widths force most riders to dismount and walk—technique matters when hypothermia is on the table. The washboarded backcountry roads and chunky lava rocks will test your bike handling and equipment choices relentlessly."
      },
      "elevation": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "At 6,400 feet of climbing over 124 miles, the math works out to manageable but persistent grinding—not Alpine suffering but enough to expose fitness gaps. The profile climbs steadily from Hvolsvöllur into Iceland's interior highlands, passing Hekla volcano's base before a high plateau descent. It's the kind of elevation that quietly accumulates while you're distracted by river crossings and volcanic moonscapes."
      },
      "climate": {
        "score": 5,
        "explanation": "Iceland's interior weather 'can turn south in minutes' with July highs averaging only 14°C, making this a masterclass in unpredictable suffering. Riders report starting in light jerseys then getting hammered by rain and sleet, with temperatures dropping 5-10°C from coastal forecasts as you climb toward the mountains. The constant wind drives what locals call 'light rain' but feels like getting sandblasted, and weather forecasts are essentially useless for planning."
      },
      "altitude": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Sea level to moderate highlands means altitude won't be your limiting factor here—Iceland's interior plateau sits well below any elevation that would affect most riders physiologically. The race starts in Hvolsvöllur near the coast and climbs into the highlands, but we're talking rolling volcanic terrain, not oxygen-debt territory. Your lungs will hurt from the cold wind, not thin air."
      },
      "adventure": {
        "score": 5,
        "explanation": "You're literally riding the tectonic rift between North American and Eurasian plates across volcanic lava fields that look like another planet. Five river crossings in 5°C water, black sand deserts, and the constant threat of weather turning biblical while you're hours from civilization—this is expedition racing disguised as a gravel event. One rider called it a 'long, wild expedition' on rough volcanic plains, which undersells the psychological impact of racing through what feels like Mordor with a chance of hypothermia."
