        "explanation": "Girona is cycling's European hub with excellent infrastructure, but registration sells out in minutes when it opens in July. Emma Porter praises organizers Klassmark: \"Any Klassmark event I've been to is always brilliant. It's not only well run, but the atmosphere is excellent.\" The race provides live tracking and professional coverage, though GPS navigation is mandatory since the course isn't fully marked."
      },
      "length": {
        "score": 5,
        "explanation": "At 360 kilometers, this distance demands multi-day preparation and overnight endurance. Emma Porter's longest training session was \"just under 9 hours\" preparing for the event. One finisher celebrated: \"After 17 hours and 28 minutes, I finally made it. The efforts of the past 5 months have paid off!\" The 32-hour cutoff sounds generous until you're grinding technical terrain in darkness with dead legs. Among the longest in gravel, comparable to Badlands."
      },
      "technicality": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "The course combines everything from smooth hardpack to punishing singletrack. Jonas Orset described \"a 7km long singletrack with many loose rocks\" where \"the final climb before the second refreshment station in Roses was so steep that almost everyone had to push their bikes.\" Mechanical failures are common - one rider's \"mech hanger snapped, flinging itself into the rear wheel and leaving the bike in pieces.\" More technical than most — comparable to Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."
      },
      "elevation": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Emma Porter notes \"almost 5,000m of climbing with most of it off-road. It's rough and rugged, steep and stunning.\" The elevation comes in relentless waves rather than one monster climb, creating tactical racing through Catalonia's varied landscape. The constant undulation from coastal plains to inland hills wears down riders progressively rather than allowing recovery periods between major ascents. More climbing than SBT GRVL at the same score."
      },
      "climate": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Late April weather in Catalonia proves unpredictable. Jonas Orset experienced the full range: \"It's getting hotter, but I enjoy it. After the chilly and dark morning, it's nice to experience weather more familiar to Catalonia. And now it starts raining too.\" Pete Stetina faced \"a race route ripped apart by a week of heavy rain\" in 2024, while Timo Rokitta enjoyed \"almost perfect\" dry conditions in 2023. Similar climate challenges to SBT GRVL."

      "altitude": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Starting from sea level in Girona means altitude isn't a factor here - your lungs will work fine, your legs are the problem. The coastal plains and rolling hills of Catalonia keep you well below any altitude that matters physiologically. If you're suffering to breathe at these elevations, gravel racing isn't your issue. This is pure power and endurance, not thin air adaptation. Modest altitude compared to Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."
      },

        "score": 5,
        "explanation": "This race earned the nickname 'Europe's Unbound' for good reason - 1,900 riders from 65+ countries converging on Girona creates an electric atmosphere that transcends typical racing. The course delivers everything from medieval villages to coastal views to technical forest singletrack in one loop. Starting at dawn with a string of red taillights climbing out of the cycling capital of Europe feels like joining something legendary. When WorldTour pros and weekend warriors line up together for 32 hours of potential suffering, you know you've found something special."

          "transcript": "[Music]\n[Applause]\nYeah, I was certainly a little bit\nnervous I think about the\nApril race\nplan a little bit earlier. I can't wait\nto see\nnervous and excited. I mean, I had three\nbackto backto back race weekends\nstarting at Levi's Grand\nBondo. Somebody did some good attacking\non the head of Jackson, the front of the\nriders that went quite early uh that we\nwe spoke to, which was about 140 mile\nroad race followed by Canyon's 50k ultra\nrun last weekend.\nstraight onto a plane to get to Jerona\nfor this 360k gravel race. So, it's been\na busy 3 weeks.\nUm, maybe a little aggressive. I don't\nknow.\nShoot. We are here in Jerona, Spain for\nthe Troka 360 gravel\nrace. This event has kind of been on my\nradar for a couple years now.\nUm, I think it has the lure of almost\nthe European unbound gravel race\nand we have some close friends who have\nraced it a few times now and had only\namazing things to say about it and that\nit was an event we should definitely put\non the calendar. And so finally just\npulled the trigger this year. It's\nobviously not easy to get to from the\nUS. It's a long travel. You have the jet\nlag, you have everything that comes with\nthat that presents other um I guess\nobstacles when it comes to races, but it\nwas yeah, one I didn't want to put off\nanymore and put it on the calendar for\n2025. Just so excited to be here. We\nhave heard so many good things about\nthis event and like Sarah mentioned,\nit's a far trip, but I think it was it\nwas one especially with Canyon here this\nyear big time and just wanted to be a\npart of it. So, so stoked to be here.\nI had a few mechanical issues at Levis's\nthat affected the day, so couldn't\nreally show fitness there, but I was\nstill able to kind of use that almost as\na precursor to the TRAA.\nUm, great run at Canyons against some of\nthe best 50k runners. Um, with the\nchallenge of getting my body recovered,\nlegs ready to go for the tracka. My name\nis Heather Jackson.\nI split my time in King Vendor in\nTucson, Arizona. What is a real injury\nlongdistance racing as a female? Showing\nup to the races like the TRAA that treat\nmen and women equally and fairly. I\nthink that's huge. Like these are the\nraces I want to be at. I guess I just\nkeep waiting\nfor a time\nwhere I'm\nnot motivated or passionate about going\nafter\nsomething\nand that hasn't happened yet.\nI keep waiting\nfor my body to fall apart physically or\njust not be able to handle this and that\nhasn't happened yet.\nSo, I don't know. It's that question of\nwho is it to decide when you're done\nracing\nor when enough's enough. It's I don't\nthink there's ever a right answer and\nonly you can decide for yourself. It's\nyour journey.\nThe first one will be the\nmen ready to\ngo in this moment.\nThe protocol here of like how we line\nup the starting\nline for me.\nthe the\nwaiting before the race actually starts,\nthe\ncountdown, those are probably the\nmost difficult\nmoments. Just all the feelings, all the\nnerves, all the anxiety, all the worry,\nall\nthe just Yeah, it's\nit's the nerves are the worst then. Um,\nI think the second the the gun goes off,\nthose kind of go away and it's just\nstraight to race mode, but the starting\nline is always for me some of the most\ndifficult moments of the entire day.\nMost every race is like that for me, but\nthis one I think adding to it that it\nwas dark out. We're starting in a grass\nfield with some like lefts and rights\nthrough over curbs, through a street,\nthrough some roundabouts on the road.\nThere was just everything while also in\nthe dark, not wanting to obviously crash\nor overlap tires with someone or just\nyeah, just added another element, I\nguess, to to the usual\nnerves. We all stayed together, I would\nsay, through through that bit into the\nfirst\num dirt descent. It was probably four or\nfive kind of loose cutbacks.\nThat was probably the first separation.\nUm, there were a couple of crashes that\nhappened that early in. I would say mile\nI think 10 or 12.\nI'm not sure how big the separation was\nor or the numbers, but I just know by\nthe time we got to the bottom of that\nfirst descent, um we were probably in a\ngroup of about 15 women or so. The main\nthing that happened was the rest of the\nrace\num went off 10 minutes after us and\nthose front men\num began to catch us. And at this race\nthere's a no drafting rule on to other\ngenders. So women cannot draft off men.\nAnd then all of a sudden you have\nhundreds of age group men flying by in\ntheir own packs. So it was this kind of\nconfusion of okay, where can we ride?\nThese people are passing us.\nThey're causing kind of this this chaos\nwhere I think everyone knew at this\npoint things were going to start to\nbreak up from our our kind of rolling\npack of women. So people started\nattacking um responding. It went from\njust a steady pace rolling on the flats\nto like okay moves are being made now.\nAt that point, I was just trying to to\njust stay on it and get back up to them\nin the chaos. Um, and we had another\nclimb that came, not one of the big\nclims, but um, I could still see those\nfront I think it was five women. Um,\nand there was definitely a gap, but\nstill in my sight. And I thought, \"Okay,\nI can catch them over the top.\" I could\nsee the top of this. It was like a super\nloose, rocky\num steep climb and then you come over\nthe top and it was a super loose\num steep descent.\nI was confident in my descending skills\nto pull back on. Um got over the top,\nstarted descending and I came around a\ncorner and there were probably five or\nsix people down on the ground just\nacross the the trail down I think. Um\nyeah, someone was pretty badly hurt. It\nwas just I I didn't go down. It was one\nof those I had to stop, make my way\naround the pile. Um, it seemed that\neveryone was helping each other out\ngetting up from the the fall, but that\ncaused definitely a bigger separation\nfrom that that front group of women. So,\nit was one of those, okay, chase mode\nengaged. Now, we're seeing the top of\nthe women's race as we've seen uh\nbefore. Luis Valentine, Sarah Storm,\nuh, Duba Prebot, uh, Danny Strosby,\nCarolina Megan are on this\ngroup. The first aid station was around\nmile 85 and I think I planned out my\nnutrition for about they had estimated\nthe front women would be through there\nin 450. Her legs uh, before I squeeze\nout my own legs. So yeah, maybe we see\nsome attacks or more aggressive racing,\nbut I think if yeah, as it looks now,\nthey uh they're just in kilometer 135.\nThis is the eight station. This is what\nwe were talking about. It's the Formula\nOne of uh gravel racing. We see the\nteammates helping each other. Here is G.\nThey're uh changing her camel pack.\nThey're putting one They're putting the\nfood on her backpack.\nIt's really important at this level to\nhave a team uh to support you. Yeah. So,\nI had just timed my nutrition off of\ncarrying what I would need for 4 hours\n50 minutes for that first bit. And I\nlooked down and it was like\n4:45ish. And I was like, perfect.\nHeather, Heather, Sasha, Sasha,\nI was with another female. I think her\nname's Maddie. Um, at that point, but\nshe I knew she needed to stop. She was\nstruggling with a collarbone injury um\nand wasn't sure what her plan forward\nwould be. My plan was I needed to just\nget my nutrition as quick as I could and\njust stay on the chasing. Doing great.\nYou're behind. Just two minutes. Hang\non. Hang on. Hang on. I had a crush too.\nMy snap. Yeah. Good luck. Thank you. You\ngot five in front of you. I have two\nminutes. Okay. Yeah. Hope you're okay.\nGood job. Good luck. Thank you. Good to\ngo. Okay. Thank you.\nUm because also sometimes after aid\nstations there can be a little bit of a\nlull when you're rolling out. So um I\nthought, okay, if I can be super quick\nhere with my transition, um maybe the\npack up the road is um kind of\nregrouping and not pushing yet again.\nSo, I had heard they were I think 90\nseconds up the road or 2 minutes. I was\ngetting um varying information out\nthere, but I think they were only a\ncouple minutes up. We see Danny Shrosby\nhere. She wasn't feeling her best this\nweek, but she decided to start.\nHopefully, her legs are uh back working,\nher mind, she's just she smiles all the\ntime. I love seeing her ride around\nhere. Yeah. No, she for now she looks\ngood. So I think um yeah she is uh\ncatching back on on good legs and uh um\nyeah this is also a good position to be\nin. I knew it was another 85 miles till\ncrew 2. So I actually cleared my wahoo\nso the time would read zero. Um the\npredicted time charts on the website\nthought that section for front females\nwould be a little bit quicker. Four and\na halfish hours. So, I had grabbed\nenough fuel for 4 and a halfish hours.\nUm, and yeah, just started back at zero.\nThought, \"Okay, I've got 4 and 1/2 hours\nahead of me.\" Um, just broke the race\ndown like that and um I was solo again\nand thought, \"Okay, four and a half\nhours almost like an iron man. Just here\nwe go.\" I think my highest heart rate\nwas in the first hour. Um, but we had a\nmass start. Oh no. Oh no. Is that G?\nYeah. G just went to the ground. Oh,\nshe's back up. She's back up. Oh. Whoa.\nWhoa. Oh. Oh. Come on. G. Something\nhappened. No. No. No. No. No. No. Okay,\nshe's back on the bike. She's pedaling.\nHopefully, she gets her heart rate back.\nYeah, I know Heather Jackson, the last\ntime I checked, the um live timing was\nonly 2 minutes behind at the last point.\nAnd Heather Jackson, I've seen her get\nher second wind. She's powerful. So, if\nthis is a flatter section and Heather\nisn't far behind, those two could work\ntogether to bridge up. I also knew that\nuh would that have been the second\nbiggest climb?\nI think it was the biggest climb of the\nday, but it was the second climb of the\nday. Um, certainly the biggest um was\nright out of that aid station. So, yeah,\nwe've been told that G is uh chasing\nback. She's pretty close to the group.\nThat's really good news. Uh, we had a\nfew miles of rolling and then it was\njust the start of this crazy crazy\nclimb. It was honestly one of the most\nepic climbs I've ever done on my bike.\nuh and that they now also like to save\ntheir legs as much as possible um to\nmake sure uh the running uh part uh goes\na bit bit\nsmoother. Uh it's a beautiful view and\nuh on the top of this hill you also will\nsee um uh Portal Selva which is also\nbeautiful white village. Uh it's similar\nto Kadakas. got over that that big climb\nand descend down and\num you basically bomb down this descent,\nlittle bit of a a gravel road and then\nthere were a bunch of people ahead of me\njust on the road standing there and I\nsaw on my map that there was a sharp\nright turn back with red, just pure dark\nred on my Wahoo map. And on the Wahoo\nbike computer,\nuh, it shows your hill grades, your hill\nclimbs coming and dark red is\nlike the the hardest climb you can have.\nAnd I was like, \"Oh what is this\none?\" This is why we were talking about\nthe hiker bike section. It's it's a\nquite long one. And anyone who thinks,\n\"Oh, no. Maybe I could ride it on a\nmountain bike. Maybe I could ride it.\"\nYou can't. Um this was the part of the\ncourse where people\nhad discussed that there's a hike a bike\nsection. So everyone was kind of like\nhands down like you got to dismount like\ndon't even attempt to climb it cuz I was\nlike oh at least I'll try but no it was\nliterally off your bike. It was it was\nlike a a trail run hill climb and not\njust for like I don't know couple\nhundred yards. It was a good half mile\nup a mountain on a mountain bike. Maybe\nI could ride in the sea camps. Um\nbecause I heard all about it before last\nyear and I went out on the wrecky and no\nit's it isn't possible to ride and at\nthat point there were a bunch of people\non the hill um cheering along with a lot\nof the the crew members of the girls\nthat were up the road. Um, so that was\ngood because I knew they couldn't have\nbeen too far ahead. And I also got intel\nthere that Danny Shrosby um was only\nlike 2 minutes up the road struggling\nwith a flat tire. We don't know how far\nback the chases are. We we saw Heather\nJackson was pulling pretty strong and\nshe's uh pretty known to be strong at\nthe finish. She's really used to long\nraces. She's got a long history of being\na professional triathlete. I saw her\nracing Coner a few years ago. She's um\nvery impressive athlete and her\ntransition over to ultra distance racing\nhas been really impressive actually.\nYeah. Just gave me that motivation to\npush even harder and that okay, people\ncan come back. People are going to be\nstruggling. Anything could happen.\nPeople can get flats. People can crash.\nJust keep going. They came back\ntogether. Uh but I think it's uh yeah uh\nquite a lot of uh tension in this group\nnow uh uh and they have to come up with\na plan to uh to close uh the gap. I had\nfinally been able to make my way up to\nDanny um who had been struggling with\nher back tire losing air. Um but despite\nkind of a soft tire, we had been able to\nwork really well together.\nI think this is Heather. Heather Jackson\nuh just passed uh Danny and told her to\nget her on her wheel.\nI know she's pretty strong, especially\nat the end of the race. Uh she's really\nused to running long races, doing long\nraces, and yeah, um that stretch leading\ninto the second aid station. I knew she\nwas going to get her tire worked on\npretty like super quick, as quick as she\ncould.\nUm, I thought I wasn't\npositive what place she was in. I didn't\nknow if it was fourth or fifth,\nsomewhere in that range. Um, so I still\ndidn't know exactly where I was, but I\njust knew the main front women, whether\nit was three of them or four of them\nwere up the road. We'll go by We'll see\nthe standings of the woman's\nSo we have uh G Sh Axel Dopot Caroline\nMegan Sarah Storm, Danny Rosby, Heather\nJackson, Liv Pers, Ruth Assel, Sophia\nSugar, and Lucy Hemstead. This is your\ntop 10 for the moments.\nWe were working really, really well\ntogether, Danny and I. And\num yeah, we were both super positive of\nif we just stay on it. She even said it\nas well. She's like, I think if we stay\non the it like this together, working\ntogether, we're going to get them\nbecause they as a group of three or\nfour, there might be more people in that\ngroup, but they're not working as\ncohesively. And she had been up with\nthem, so she kind of knew even better\nthan I did, at least what had been going\non earlier in the day. I think they are\nall aware that they um yeah they need to\nget to this uh second feed station and\nthen to the bottom of the climb. Uh and\nfrom there on uh yeah it will be less uh\nchitty jets uh and more uh more racing\nand uh um attacks but now they uh yeah\nthey they need each other. Yeah. Here we\nsee Sarah giving some encouragement\nwords to G.\nComing into the second aid\nstation, I knew that the last major\nclimb was coming and I felt very\nhydrated. I felt very fueled. I knew\nthat the section\nafter that second aid station was a\nmassive climb and that stretch was only\n26 miles till I could see my crew again\nat the third and final aid station. And\nso I\nthought I don't want to carry like a\nfive pound hydration pack up the last\ngnarly climb.\nAnd I pretty I I know I can get through\nthat stretch only 26 miles on two\nbottles and then I'll use my pack for\nthe last stretch um instead of this\nclimb. That That's what was going\nthrough my head.\nOh, actually I'm going to take this at\nthe last one and just the bottles now.\nYeah, let's go.\nHeather 5 minutes.\nOkay.\nI knew I was still very\num clear in my head. I wasn't like super\nfatigued and tired because my mind was\nstill working enough where I was\ncalculating,\nokay, what is coming in the course and\nhow can I get through this next stretch\nthe best? And so I didn't take the pack,\nthe second aid station, just grab\nbottles, grab my gels, and kind of prep\nmyself for um the final massive climb of\nthe day. No, that's uh that's for sure\nbecause if you hit one of those uh big\nrocks with your front wheel, uh there's\na risk of crashing and for sure a risk\nof flooding out. Um but now um yeah all\nthe women are uh taking their\nresponsibility uh opening little gaps so\nthey can see what's coming uh and\nprobably at the bottom they uh yeah they\nwill start to stick together again\nbut yeah she has a flatun flat exactly\nwhat we saw we saw a rock hitting her\nwheel and yeah we were just saying that\nthis kind of terrain\nas we came into the or got closer\nto the final crew station. Uh, as you\nkind of get closer to where they are,\nyou're entering kind of little towns or\nor areas where there's more people out.\nSo, there were certainly spectators out\nalong the roads as we were coming\ngetting closer. And Danny was great. I\nmean, she kept shouting to people on the\nside like, \"How far up are they? How far\nup are they?\"\nAnd we were getting such\nmixed messaging that it was we were just\nlike I don't even know. Like we kept\nseeing someone they kept being like just\na little bit just a little bit. And we\nwere like what does a little bit mean?\nThis is the lead woman um group. Yeah.\nIt's uh Axel Dua Preots. It's Carolyn\nMiggon and it's Sarah Storm. I still\nwasn't aware of my exact placing. I\nthought we were either fourth, fifth, or\nsixth. I didn't know if we were five and\nsix or four and five. I I knew\nthat previous winner Carol was up the\nroad. I knew Sarah Sturm and I knew\nAxel.\nUm, and I wasn't sure if there was one\nother female again because I wasn't sure\nif I had passed her on a descent or not.\nG tried to save it, put one leg out, but\nyeah, she got a bit of fall and then had\nto stop it with her hand down. Mhm. And\nat the beginning, she tried to hop back,\nbut felt the pain and then Yeah, took\nher a while to get back onto it. She got\nback into it. She got to the group. She\nkept on fighting, but yeah, the pain was\nunbearable. We had seen ghee on the side\nof the road um in that previous section.\noff her bike holding her arm wrapped in\na cast. So just yeah, feel horrible for\nher having to to pull out. I think she\nended up fracturing her elbow in a\ncrash. Um so I did know that the front\ngroup was down ghee.\nUm but I still wasn't positive. As you\nsee, they're not pedaling as strong as\nthey were. They're saving their\nlegs. you think they're already thinking\nabout the finish. Yeah, they're not\npushing that much power because they\nboth uh the three of them are climbers.\nThey love climbing and there's only one\nclimb left\nand I think that's where we're going to\nsee the big uh move for the win. But\nyeah, there's still a couple kilometers\naway and a lot can\nhappen. Start uh still have the eight\nstation here.\nSarah, let's go.\nGo, go, go. Axel didn't stop and K looks\nthat they didn't stop either. Ch didn't\nlose a lot of time, but And she's back.\nWe came into the final aid.\nUm,\nand originally I had thought I was going\nto grab my pack for the last bit because\nthere's a lot of single track um,\nsections through there where I didn't\nthink I would be able to reach down and\ngrab bottles and stay hydrated\num, versus wearing a pack and being able\nto still hydrate. But there's\nalso one final crazy climb of the in the\ncourse at that part. Just shows. Yeah.\nI'm going to stay light.\nBottles. Is there one? Yeah. Just one.\nGood job, Head. More riders. Uh, going\nthrough the fit\nzone. I think it's Heather Jackson and\nDanny Ros and Danny.\nYeah, it's good to see these two riders\nworking together.\nDon't think they're going to get back to\nthe this three, but I still think\nthey're probably they're probably\nstronger than these three on the flat,\nthough. So, they might actually be able\nto close down some of that time. What\ndid you say before? It was 6 minutes\nbefore. So, that's a that's a lot of\ntime, but I wouldn't be surprised if\nbefore we hit the next climb, they're\nactually a little bit closer. I really\nwanted to get top five, and that meant I\nneeded to figure out if I could somehow\ncome out ahead of Danny on the day. So\nthat was kind of what was going through\nmy mind. Danny is uh fighting for the\nfourth position with Heather Jackson at\nthe moment. Okay. You you how many\ntimes? Uh 5 minutes the last time they\ntold us, but they're working really good\ntogether and they're I think they're\ncutting a bit of time. I don't think for\nthe distance it's going to be enough,\nbut they're Yeah, they're working\ntogether really good. After the third\naid station, probably I think it was\nmaybe eight to 10 miles later came the\nfinal it's super steep gravel climb.\nHere we are hitting the critical stage\nstarting the last climb. I actually\nentered it ahead of her and tried to\nstand up because it was so steep and\ncompletely slid out. Had to uncip and\nshe got by me at the base. And so I was\nlike, shh. It was so\nnerve-wracking being trying to get back\ninto my pedals on whatever that was, 15%\ngrade on dirt and getting being able to\nget going again. And I somehow\nmiraculously was able to get back on the\nbike and get up this grade behind her.\nNow Danny and Heather had hit the last\nlittle climb. Half a mile later, there's\na little bit of a flattening out part of\nthe climb in a corner before it kicks up\nagain. Then you can dictate the pace\nmore. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So, I wonder if\nwe'll see a little attack coming into\nthat single track to see who gets that\nfront position. You want to be in the\nfront for the single track. And so, I\nwas able at that point to kind of\nregroup and we started climbing again.\nAnd the road was wide enough that we\nwere kind of side by side. Danny and\nHeather hitting the last part of the\nclimb to Sangra. I didn't like\ndecisively attack. It was just one of\nthose at that part in the race. I mean,\nyou're 200 what 10 miles into the day.\nOkay. Uh Heather is pushing ahead from\nuh Danny. She's fighting for the fourth\nposition. We knew she was going to have\nan amazing day and uh loving the course,\nbut yeah, I think she's just firing up\nand pushing on. What a competitor. I was\nable to just climb and a gap started\nforming. I looked back. I couldn't see\nher, so I was like, \"This is the moment\nI need to push now.\" And she's got so\nmuch experience. She's been in the long\ndistance racing for a long time. Long\nhistory. Yeah. Fifth last year at\nObound. She touches so many different\ndisciplines and she's just so strong\nmentally.\nJust cuz I had a gap on the climb, I\nwasn't positive that that was it. It was\nnow I have to descend. Well, the descent\noff the back is gnarly. Fortunately, it\nhad been raining a little bit, so the\nground was a little bit um tackier. Um\nnot like super dusty and loose, which it\nhad been when I pre-rode the course.\nHeather Jackson fighting for the fourth\nposition just dropping Danny Shrosby. Uh\nthey've been working together for last\nhundred of kilometers. So\nyeah, this is where she hit the hammer.\nOkay. Yep. We knew this was going to\nhappen. We haven't meant letting them\npass. They hit the first butthole.\nKumigan on the front. Sartorm just on\nher wheel. And then Axel Dubot on the\nthird position trying to pass Sara but\nyeah yeah yeah here. Yep. I mean I was\nbattling to get top five but I was also\nstill positive\nthinking someone could flat so easy\nbecause the last stretch is so technical\nwith roots and rocks and uh back to\nsecond and third position. So Sarah\nStorm and Axel\nfighting a bit trying to catch Caroline\nthat took advantage in those in this\nsingle track. If you nail a river\ncrossing, you can't see where your bike\nis going in terms of like what you're\nhitting under the water and the final\nriver crossing came up to my chest. You\nsee Heather Jackson, we knew she was\nenjoying, we talked to her yesterday on\nthe athletes presentation, her first\ntime racing\ntracker. She's just a fighter. She does\na bit of Iron Man, a bit of trail\nrunning, uh, crazy distances, but\nanything could happen there where\nsomeone's bike stops working. So, I was\nstill just battling to get as further as\nfar up as I could. That is an impressive\nlead that she has created in a very\nshort period of time. I still was not\nconfident that that was it, that it was\nholding. I mean, I kept thinking she was\nabout to be back on my wheel. So, second\nyear in a row. That is\nAn impressive. Congratulations.\nImpressive ride. 13 hours 38 minutes.\nGoing to be 39 minutes. Catalina big\nfrom Poland. When I popped out of the\nsingle track and came onto kind of the\nthe grassy park area where the finish\narea\nis. I think I knew I had it at that\npoint in terms of my mini race going on\nwith Danny. Axel coming second. Pushing,\npushing, pushing all the way. Axel Duban\nsecond, Sarah Storm third. And it was\njust\nlike\nthis mind blown moment of like I cannot\neven begin to comprehend all of the\ndifferent parts\nof what went down in this one day of\ncycling on in the 13 something hours I\njust spent on the bike. We're seeing\nHeather Jackson just arriving to Fontao.\nWe're going to have her 30 seconds, 40\nseconds in the finish line. What a ride.\nWhat a day for this American rider. It\nfelt like forever since we had rolled\nout from that start line and yet it felt\nlike two seconds had passed and all of a\nsudden I'm literally back to the finish\nline area which is was also the start\nline area that we had just rolled out in\nthe dark seconds earlier. Heather\nJackson for you. Fourth position Draa\n36060. Her first year uh doing Draa. I'm\n100% sure she'll be back. She will be\nhappy with that result. I'm sure. What a\nfighter.\nI knew I gave my best on that day with\neverything that happened in the race and\nit was just Yeah. Sometimes\nthat's that's a victory. That's success.\nThis this day was just a win for me in\nterms of a a life experience win. It was\nso epic.",

          "transcript": "how are you feeling ahead of the\n[Music]\ntracker this is my new best bud Peppa\nshe does actually speak I am here in\ndrona in my favorite place to gravel for\nthe track of 360 which is one of the\nbiggest gravel races in the world and\nprobably the biggest in Europe the\ntracker 360s tomorrow and I have to say\nI'm a little bit nervous just because\nit's such a long way and you have no\nidea how your body's going to respond\nI'm really excited because I remember\nlast year I'm going to say overall it\nwas a positive day it was quite a rough\nday I was like not swallowing rice and\nlike vomiting\neverywhere do you have any words for\nyour subscribers don't do the\ntracker what did you say I've just\nup come on\nbut apart from that like it was an\namazing experience the like scenery here\nis incredible the atmosphere is amazing\nat this event so yeah I'm looking\nforward to it and I'm looking forward to\nlike testing myself because I feel like\nmy fitness is in such a better place\nthan this time last year I just kind of\nwant to do the best I can for myself\nnervous but also really excited for\ntomorrow how have you prepared for the\nrace so this race I've kind of done\nquite a lot of specific preparation for\nthis is one of my like Target races for\nthis year so I've done a lot of longer\nrides like B big volume days just to\npractice fueling and see how my body\nresponds to that kind of effort and work\nout like what sort of power I can\nmaintain over like hours what's your um\ngoal for the race so I'd say my goal for\nthe race is to literally just do the\nbest within my own ability I would love\nto get a really strong result in this\nrace and I think it's not completely out\nof possibility for me to get a good\nresult here especially like given I've\ndone the race before I've got the\nexperience doing the Race before and\nalso like it is more of an endurance\nChallenge and that's what suits me more\nbut at the same time like the depth of\nthe field this year is insane and I\nthink last year coming Fifth versus this\nyear coming fifth will be two very\ndifferent achievements this year I think\ntop 10 is going to be something that's\npretty a pretty impressive achievement\nI've been logged out but I think the\nnext question was about nutrition\nnutrition is something that's super key\nfor this race because it's so long and\nit's just so many hours on a bike you\ncan't mess up your nutrition strategy\nI've been practicing eating various\nthings on the bike and seeing what I can\nstomach at intensity it's very different\nso seeing how my body responds tomorrow\nmight be a little bit different I've got\nOT super gels which are 40 grams of gel\nand I typically eat quite a lot of those\nbut for a whole day out I need to think\nabout Whole Foods so I'm going to even\nget some Pringles like I know last year\nI had some Pringles towards the end of\nthe race I'm going to just try and eat\nas much as possible over the day I'm\ngoing to bring a variety of food and\ngive my like swanes so much food to give\nme because I want absolute choice and\nselection whenever I get to the FED\nzones of what I'm wanting to eat at that\nmoment it's basically an eating\ncompetition the TR 360 it's not a\ncycling\ncompetition you glad you're not doing\n560k today we are going on a wky of the\nbeginning of the course which is just a\nroad race basically for the first 13k so\nwe're going to go ride some road I'll do\nsome little efforts cuz I need to prep\nmy legs for tomorrow one thing to note\nis the 560 got cancelled is Josh's race\nand that means that all of those Riders\nare now doing the 360 pretty much\nso the girls who are at the front end of\nthe 560 going to be racing the 360 so\nit's even stronger field I already\nthought it was a pretty strong field\nI've like always said Jon is the best\nplace in the world for gravel training\nfor gravel riding doesn't\nrain the gravel is like continuous and\nit's real gravel it's mud it's literally\nMudder than moment so I don't know about\nyou Josh but I've got a spare pair of\nsocks you got swanny cam again this year\nI do have swanny Cam again I think\npeople love the swanny cam more than\nthey love the the Maddy cam but you\nknow that's okay I'm ready to\nshine I've been prepping all day I've\ncarbon loaded I've had my electrolytes\nwhat is SW cam Swan cam is me the for\nthose who don't know what a swan is I'm\na swan and that means my job is to hold\nbottles like this hold food like that\nsay positive things like whatever\nnegative thing you're thinking reverse\nit honey positivity only you are\nsmashing it King you're smashing it King\nstuff like that and then I just film it\nand then it's Swan cam because it's a\nbig day for them but it's also a big day\nfor us and I think swanes don't get\nenough representation so Swan cam is\ninvented to help all of us feel seen the\nbehind the scenes people are just as\nimportant you know I can be um what's\nthe word out sea first bit of gravel we\n17K\nin 5 4\n3 it's actually beautiful weather it's\nnot been like this I tell you it's not\nbeen like this the past few days and now\nyeah going to go find some food and prep\nfor tomorrow big day tomorrow good luck\nthank you and you too I'll find you I'll\ntry I'm try and find you on the course\nif I find Josh there's a thousand people\nI think it might be quite difficult I\ndon't know it might be quite difficult\nworried about anything in particular\njust I'm not a s cross\nRider guys I wor my white\nsneakers coming\nup there's no hiding in that sweather\nyeah they're all talking about 1 hour\nmore of sleep I think that is just a\nquick look of the fire power we got in\nthe women's race from Emma as well there\nmight be a few roll downs from the\n560 it's chicken and rice but we kind of\nwe failed with the rice cooker so it's\ncoconut rice a little bit liquidy but\nI'm excited was off how's that rice fine\nit's actually real good looking I think\nthat good it's like it's like\nRoto race\nday\nno what time did you wake up quarter to\n5 which was an hour later than what we\noriginally would have\nhad I'm so\ntired hello and welcome to the start of\nswanny camp today I woke up at 4:45 um\n4:55 cuz I let myself have a snooze it's\nvery important day today we started by\nfueling toast peanut butter jam MADD\nwhat did you feel with rice she had\nrice very effectively I've made Maddie\nput everything in a pile because if it's\nnot in the pile it's not going to be\nbought we've got a second swanie with us\ntoday uh I'm sure you might recognize\nher when she's introduced Technically\nshe's an intern but I have given her\nsome control because I really believe in\nuplifting the new\nswanes while she is an intern she ALS\nalso has way more knowledge than I've\never had in my entire\nlife\nthere um no I've done so many\nwe you've done what so many we no tell\nthe truth mie I have so many\npo what's the Poo Cat\nfour then I took a pill to stop me\npooing\nit's stressful for us as well because\neveryone's shouting everyone's trying to\npass things you're trying to be the best\none you can be I'm watching Maddie in\nher coat going when's that girl going to\ngive me her\ncoat emotional start\nline\n2024 good luck have a nice day\n[Applause]\ntwo one let's go\nhey I\nsee let come on things let\nwelcome to Thea\n[Laughter]\n2024 oh this is really cute\ngoing to get me\nemotional so the race went off\nincredibly hard and I just decided very\nearly on that I wasn't going to kind of\npush my power above a certain limit\nearly on cuz I didn't want to blow up\nlater so I held back at the start I knew\nthis was a risk because I wasn't ever\ngoing to make it to like the front\ngroups or like faster groups and\nMen Amir what are you eating for\nbreakfast basically what M ate the life\nof a swan as\nwell margaritas\nso at this point in the race I was\nsomewhere between about 15th and 20th\nwomen and I just decided you know what\nI'm just going to keep it my power all\nday and I'm just going to work my way\nforwards because they've gone off so\nhard undeniably people are going to blow\nup so I was just looking to move forward\nthrough different groups and this\nactually here is a beautiful little\nflowy single track section that was\nreally fun\nI definitely felt pretty good at this\npoint in the race cuz I hadn't gone\nsuper hard early so I was just looking\nfor Wheels I wanted to set on for a bit\nor riders that I was going to ride with\nand any kind of mud sections I tried to\nkind of go through without losing speed\nbut a lot of people were breaking quite\na lot when we hit mud and I also used\nany Hills to my advantage so I try and\nlike accelerate up the hills and kind of\nwork forward away from the group group\nthat I was\nin the course was definitely very\ndifferent to last year's and the cor\nside wcky just because of the huge\namount of rainfall that we'd had the few\ndays before and it just made for like\nmore comedic and fun moments where like\nsomeone fell into like a river crossing\nor something so you had to be really\nreally on it with the lines you were\ntaking and I tended to try and stay like\nslightly behind someone so I could see\nsomeone go for a puddle first so I could\nsee what which line was safe\nbre\nat this point I noticed Cynthia and seia\nahead and I was like okay amazing I'm\ngoing to go find them and ride with them\nand then I'll know roughly where I am in\nthe women's field so we were actually in\n8th 9th and 10th at this point and I\nrealized right this this is a good place\nthis is a good group good Pace I want to\nride with these guys for a\nbit I also passed Josh who was drinking\na red bll looking very blown so we've\nactually got some Josh content now\nbecause we did find each other in the\nThousand field race\nsadly I wasn't racing with a mic but\nbasically I said I'm feeling pretty good\nand that I'd held back at the beginning\nand I was just going to try and keep\nthis pace and work my way forward a\nbit that's a\nbig where's Mikey Mikey go on King go\non go on Mikey what do you need uh Food\nbanana\nbanana do you need\ngels you've got this you are smashing it\nKing you're smashing it King cyle\nZoom Annie you smashed that we didn't SW\nbottles it's fine he hydration ve had\nfor one cuz I looked at it and thought\nit's\nokay Annie how do you feel\noh my go\ngosh coming into the field I pushed on a\nbit and I think I dropped the group that\nI was in because I was just desperate\nfor a Wii Amir how are you feeling pre\nfirst feed I see really Strat the men\ndid it so much quicker than I thought\nthey were going to they basically didn't\neven stop Mikey was like moving forward\nas we were doing stuff so I think we\njust need to be aware that she might\nstop for like 10 seconds rather than the\nminute we maybe thoughts of the\nyear you got this you're\namazing are really\ngood whoever you're with\nokay\ntoone do you\nneed a\nb your hand I'll put them in your the\npoet out my do you not need sweeties the\none empty sweetties got more shut\nthat mad you're amazing you're amazing\nzoom zoom you got this\nlove swanny cam we have done the first\nfeed we're now decided to do a morale\nstop yeah they are going quite quick\nhere but better not so we're here just\ncheering people on also no one knows\nwhere they're going so every time they\ncome past we have to shout left so they\nknow oh yeah they're coming\nleft left\nand without us the whole thing would\ncrumble meanwhile we hit a hiker bike\nsection that was about 250 M long and it\nwas unbelievably steep in parts of it\nand here I was basically just saying\nyeah I'm having a great time not really\nappreciating the hiking section and I'm\ndesperate for a Wii but there's no\nreally for me to pee and I didn't really\nwant to pee myself and that's why I was\ntelling them on\ncamera love\nyou you've got this s te you're\namazing\nyeah you're all smashing it you're\ninspiring a nation you're doing so\nwell so to love you you're doing amazing\nguys stay\nhydrated and now we're getting ready for\nthe second feed but conclusion is we're\nsleeping I'm tired she really far away\nso sadly my GoPro stopped working in\nlike the most beautiful part of the\nroute which was like the really climbing\nsection which was so sad but I managed\nto get these like random shots just\nbefore I dropped from this group so at\nthis point I'm in seventh and eighth\nwith svena and I'm trying to sit on her\nwheel but this guy gets in between us\nand we hit this mud section and\nbasically he kept like breaking then\naccelerating breaking and accelerating\nin the mud and you'll see it in a second\nand was just absolutely knackering me\nout and I just couldn't get back on the\nwheel and this is what led me to dropped\nfrom this group which was really\nfrustrating cuz Fen actually ended up\ncoming in sixth position but I dropped\nfrom this group and then was on my own\nand finally was like right now is the\ntime for me to have my Wii that I've\nbeen so desperate for I rode with a guy\nfor a little bit and I couldn't keep on\nhim because I was just so desperate to\nwe had a big we then managed to find a\ngroup to ride with for the rest of the\nflat section but we were pretty chilly\nso here you can see he's just like\nsprinting out of the mud sections and I\njust couldn't hold the\nwheel Amir how's swanny life going it's\nall right I got some ice cream what\nflavor did you go for cookie dough\nthis feed feed Zone\nto you know what I know it's acceptable\nto piss in your shammy if you're coming\nin the top 10 but it's not acceptable\nfor a Swani to piss in her pants but I\nam\nclose go right to the end\nMatt through here through\nhere through the end through the end\nright to the\nend you want yes this is MADD n and this\nis the middle of the tracker got a\ndifferent type of sadly we have no more\nrace content because my GoPro is just\nabsolutely having some weird like mess\nup on that day anyways sad but at this\npoint I was 90k to go and I left that\nfeed on my own and I didn't ride with\nanyone pretty much for the entire rest\nof the race which is pretty hard\ngoinging and hard on morale if you're on\nyour own I'd lost quite a lot of time\nbecause I'd been in like a group that\nwas moving a bit slower through the flat\nsection and no one was really wanting to\npush the pace and I definitely wasn't\nwanting to sit on the front and push the\npace when I'd been on my own for a bit\nbefore for and I was wanting to recover\nso I could be fast at the end anyway so\nwe had 90k to go we had this huge climb\nwhich is absolutely stunning I got up it\nwas really happy cuz last year I'd had\nto walk I had to walk sections of it\nbecause I was so blown but I felt all\nright and basically I like sped up\ntowards the end because I was like I\njust need to finish right at the final\nfeed I had to park in a ditch am was\ngone because she was about to wet\nherself we have the setup which is\npicnic style where Maddie can just\nchoose anything it's just she lands and\nshe goes this this this and this um\nshe's doing really well I think she's\nlike 7th or eighth at the moment I also\nhad to run to this stop because he had\nto park so far away but luckily I wore\nmy London Marathon sneakers well done\nlights yeah we've got one and we'll go\nget you another I need a front I need a\nback light about we have to get you one\nthank you so much sh do you need any\nwater yeah plain water or with\nstuff maybe swap one of the things um\nyou might miss the dark if you okay dark\nsunset's at 8:50 you still those you're\ndoing\namazing do you want a kiss got to go\nthis way they being a bit funny about it\nI love you amazing you got this thanks\nguys you're amazing Maddy love\nyou love you let's go\nMaddy come on\nbuddy yes buddy\nyou did so\ngood so nice can I go on hot or not yet\nI will I'm just letting her have a her\nget in there get in there\nbaby she needs to laugh after some hours\nthat was so\nhard I stopped eating like a while ago\nwater you know what I'm so much better\nthan last\nyear m m\nm n\nyou guys did you drink it I didn't drink\na yeah just um

          "transcript": "The track is the big one here in Jerona,\nSpain. Effectively the European version\nof Unbound. Much like Unbound, there's\nthousands of racers doing it. Much like\nUnbound, there's multiple distances, but\nit's Euro here. So, we count K. The the\nbig one is 560K. There's a 360 km, a 200\nkm, and then wraps up on Sunday, my\nbirthday, as it were, with the 100k,\nwhich is what I will be doing since I've\nnever been here. And there's quite a\nvariety of of bikes. going to take a\nstroll around and and see what sort of\nspecial gravel flavor the truck brings\nin terms of bikes and\n[Music]\n[Applause]\nriders. Here's Rosa Closer's Canyon\nGrail. Big old ring on this bad boy. 48\nlooks like paired to the Eagle for the\nmullet. It's got a cool cockpit setup.\nNarrow was arrow of course, but then\nit's a wee bit of extracurricular grip\ntape pros back road. Can't say I've seen\none of these stateates\nside. Stick it up\nnormal. Subtle on the branding, right?\nNothing on the down tube. Just got the R\non a head tube. Got a Pathfinder jammed\nin there. It's still a couple mill\nclearance.\nYou just finished the 200. How was the\nrace today? It was amazing. It was so\nmuch fun for me cuz uh I did the first\ntime and I choose the correct bike and I\nI I this is the fastest setup you can\nchoose here for Tracker 200 cuz um the\ntire is so nice on the descent. You have\nfully control. You got a it looks like a\nThunderbird up front and then a Schwabby\nG1 G1 Air 50 mm on the back. Uh the\nThunderbird is a 2.2. Okay. Yeah. And\ntell tell me about this configuration\nhere. This is Yeah. This is a custom\nmade part. Yeah. This uh my my tool and\nand a plugger. Yeah. Yeah. And for sure\nI have stuff right there. Yeah. And uh\nand the bag is so so good. So all I take\nall my feet here in the back and uh\nYeah. Yeah. And is that that's custom to\nRose then? Yeah. Is that a a Rose bag or\nwhat what type of bag? This is a rose\nbag. You can uh buy it with a with a\nbike. Okay. This is a very nice uh fitt\nOh, sweet. It's magnetic. Yeah. And you\ncan uh\nFidlock bottles. Oh, that's that's super\ncool. It is. I like that. Yeah. You got\none ring to rule them all. Yeah. This is\nuh this is uh Do you have enough gears?\nThis is uh set up with classified. Okay.\nSo you do? Yeah. This is uh very nice\nhere cuz uh with a big chain ring uh\nyeah and 40 40 teeth in in the rear. So\nand then with classified it's it's\nreally nice. Some of the brands are\nfamiliar. Specialized of course with the\ndiverge or ba of course we're going to\nsee a Spanish brand in a Spanish\nrace. Live open. pretty straightforward.\nBut then how many boss you see floating\naround the US? Not so many. You can\nclick the link below to check out the\nbike check with Mattea Demari who just\ndid the 360 and the 200 like a crazy\nperson back to\nback. Envy Frey from Service Course is a\nhigh-end bike shop here in Jerona.\nRossman, Seattle, Washington represent\nwith not\none but two. Look at this bad boy right\nhere. Down tube\nshifters. Cany\nbrakes right next to a bicycle from a\ndifferent era. Dex, you just wrapped up\nthe\n200k trocoa. How the day go for you out\nthere? Yeah, tough. Um the back went\nlike 15k in and then 180k trying to\nnurse it nurse it around and nurse nurse\nthe bike around as well. Um but yeah, my\nfirst gravel race. So first ever gravel\nrace. I was going to ask you if you've\never done truck, but you've never done\nany gravel. Never done any gravel. So\nwhat what possessed you to do such a\nridiculous thing, sir? Uh I don't know.\nI spoke to my coach and he was like,\n\"Oh, it might suit you.\" Um I'm not\ngoing to listen to him again, though,\ncuz it was horrible. Um, yeah. No, I\nloved it. It was great. Judging from the\nskins, it looks like you come from a\nroad racing background. Oh, yeah. Yeah,\num, yeah, I race a lot of road. Um,\nwhich is very different. So, but no,\nit's I really enjoyed it. So, yeah,\nprobably be back next year. What What\nwould you change about your bike setup\nif anything?\nUm, something that's not 10 years old.\nYeah, that isn't a cross bike.\nUm, and probably something that isn't at\nleast one size too small for me. Um,\nyeah, but it it did all right. Um, I\nthink for my first one, I didn't want to\nput in a lot of money and I'm a student,\nso I can't. Sure. Um, and so I kind of\njust made do and run what you brung.\nExactly. All right.\nGot a cockpit getting close to Dylan\nJohnson levels with a wee little reach\nBMC Kais has a 36 cm bar which is\nalready quite skinny. And then these\nlevers are jammed on in.\nWhat else we got here? Specialized\nFocus,\nSpecialized, Factor, Giant, Orbea,\nyou know, a fair amount of the the big\nbrands that you represent, you'd expect\nto see here. Then there's\nalso this bike did not do the Chaka look\nout of France, of\ncourse. Kagago rolling\nin. Yeah, it's a gravel party.\nDon't see too many argonauts in the\nwild.\nGot another Ridley cable disc brake.\nThis bad boy with a oval ring on a 105\ncrank. Bikes for the 560. Built's a\nlittle bit\ndifferent. People are out there for well\nover a day.\nJust spoke with\nSimon of PAC who did his in 36 hours.\nNice work,\nSimon. Check out this 3T Extrema\nItalia. Big old chunker down tube and\nclearance for chunker\ntires. Bring them in. Bring them in.\nBring them\nin. I dig the paint job on this crux.\nCheck that\nout. Looks like a handone\noption on this\nmodel. Pretty\nnice. Invogue bar\nsetup. Invogue lever setup, I should\nsay. Slammed. Speaking of swanky paint\njobs, let's dig this Mog with the wheel\nstickers to match.\nGot the new\ncheckmate. Serve\nSparrow. Yet another\n3T. Oh, sprint finish. Sprint\nfinish. And the little one takes it on\nthe line. These paint jobs keep getting\nbetter and better.\nLook at that mog.\nBam. And the winning bike of the Chroa\n560 is not this,\nbut it's a family friendly affair here\nat\nChaka. Another\nrose. Some crazy sculpting on that bar.\nGold lightweight wheels. Check.\nCheck out Paul's Ridley with Zips Super\nFatty 33 Explorer wheels. He's got the\nfresh the new new from Conci the Dubnet\nwhich replaces the Race\nKing 2.2s crammed in there on this\nRidley. Got the Wii little ina 360\nthere.\nBit of extra grip tape up top. More for\nthe forearms than the the hands. It\nworks for the hands, too. Looks like he\nmade some last minute height adjustments\nwithout cutting the steer\nthere. Got to move\nsaddle. These guys are out of\nColorado. And now here's Rosa's bike\nfrom today. Freshly laundered by the\ngood folks in the Canyon tent. There's\nGrizzle. Canyon, of course, having the\nGrail race bike and the Grizzle more\nadventure bike, but turns out you can\nrace any bike,\nright? Whereas Paul's got the new DNA\ntalls on his 303 Explorers. Rosa's got\nthe the old school race 2.2\nto on the Grizzle, which I would assume\nis why she is on the Grizzle, not the\nGrail, is because the Grail can run up\nto a 42 mil tire, not a big old chunker\nlike these 2.2s.\nA little bit of extra security with the\nchain guard there. I've had great luck\nwith Strams derailers as far as chain\nretention, but you know, for a weight\npenalty of just a few grams, better safe\nthan sorry, right?\nRosa also has the uh move saddle out of\nColorado\nthere. Hard carbon base and then like a\nfor pro rise surprisingly squishy in a\nnice way uh foam up\ntop. Another big baller coming in with a\ntop 10. Carol Schiff opted for the\nGrail.\nShe's got Thunderbirds up front and then\nthe Schwabby G1 RS Pro in the rear.\nAgain, because of that 42 clearance, you\ncan squeeze a 45. And I would venture to\nguess that this is in fact a 45. Let's\nsee if I can see a mark on here.\nYeah, these are 45s. Folks at Cany were\nexplained to me today that they're going\nwith the new ISO standard of 4.75\nmillimeters of clearance on either side\nis what determines tire clearance,\nright? So, their Grail can handle a 42\ntire with 4.75 mm. Seems like we're\nstarting to split hairs here uh of\nclearance on either side, but as Shift\nshows, you can get a 45 in there with\nroom. I'd chalk this up zero race\ngravel. SRM power meter on a double\nShimano 12-speed ring. Once upon a time,\nwe saw more SRM in the US, but on a\ngravel bike, I could count on one hand\nthe number of times I've seen SRM power\nmeters in the US.\nCanyon Grail Generation One, the hover\nbar. Remember that bad boy?\nNow, of course, we've\ngot generation two.\ncame out a couple years ago. Yet another\nCarolyn shift bike. I'm guessing this\nmight be one from a little race called\nUnbound\nGravel. She did okay there. Of course\nshe\ndid. And\nthen let's see if we can find a\ngeneration 3 Grail with the suspension\nfork up front.\nDon't see too many Stevens bikes in the\nUS.\nDo remember seeing them in\nCyclacross underneath Katie Compton, but\naside from that, they're pretty rare on\nthe American side of the Atlantic. Mogs\nare\neverywhere. Check out the tie crank and\nsolid ring on that guy.\nCongrats on finishing the TRA 200. 200.\nYeah. Tell me about your bike here. The\nAlt Road Al. How do you pronounce it? I\ndon't even know how to pronounce it. I\nfull. It's Art Red. Yep. It's a friend\nof me. Okay. Uh he did is in. It's a\nvery little brand. Uh handmade, full uh\nhe did it he did only uh on the weekend\nbecause it's not his full job. Yeah. So\nwe have the idea. We inspired from able\nand yeah we try to do something cool\nwith a nice build and yeah also the seat\npost integrated and integrated uh\nheadset. Yeah. And we can see also full\nintegrated uh the brake\ncourse you have inside the Unox. Yes.\ncircle and it's fully\nand these wheel I'm not familiar with\nthe wheels the wheels yeah\nI'm sponsored by bike okay uh from one\nyear and yeah the wheels is is nice but\nit's hard to to ride 200 with with this\nyeah at the end I'm a little weight I\nonly do 60 kilos and uh at the end it's\na bit hard for me to wear this but it's\nvery\nIt's light. It's like 1 kilo 300. So\nyeah, it's light. And uh it's for the\nste. It's really still a steel bike.\nNice. Sir, you just wrapped up track of\n200. How was it for you out there?\nBeautiful is the word that comes to\nmind. Both brutal and beautiful at the\nsame time. Do you have this word\ntrademarked? I I'll I'll work on that\nright after this when I can think\nstraight again. You were on a pivot\nvault with some 50C tires. Was that the\nright choice or what would you change? I\nfelt quite happy with that choice but I\nthink I was running a little uh too much\npressure in them perhaps. Some of those\ndescents were uh yeah quite rough.\nOh Benia Oh nice. Thanks. How how was it\nout there for you? It was horrendous.\nThe first 50k is so hard. Yeah. You you\ncan't not go well above threshold for\nthe first 50k and then after that it's\nlike find a group and hang on really for\ndear life. Have you done this race\nbefore? Yeah. All right. Been out here\nin mid and road a lot, but never gravel.\nSo, first time. How are you uh with your\nbike choice? Is there anything you would\nchange for you to do it again? Um my\nlevers shifted forward on a bump, but\nyou can't do much about that other than\nTitan then. But it's a AliExpress\nspecial. Pretty much everything is\nAliExpress and it was absolutely\nperfect. It was great. Yeah. What is the\nchain ring? 46. I've got a 50 on the\nback, 13-speed wheel top.\nUm yeah, it was okay. I would have liked\nMaybe if I'd gone like a 44 at the front\nor a 52 at the back, it would have\nhelped a bit cuz there's some really\nsteep stuff. But I love how the the\nrings and the chain match there. Yeah.\nYeah. Everything has to even the valve\nstand really pulls the whole room\ntogether. Yeah. Thanks, Hope, for\nanodizing stuff in orange. Yeah. Nice.\nAnd you got your beautiful daughter and\nwife here to finish. Nice way to wrap it\nup. Lovely way to finish. Thanks very\nmuch. Got some more biker head wheels\nhere on the crux.\nYou all seen these in the US? I have\nnot.\nBy Turbo Gravel Arrow.\nGot the fresh specialized rubber on\nthere. Not all days go well.\nSorry about\nthat. David's body. Okay. Yeah. Yeah.\nYeah. I didn't crash. No. What happened?\nUm, in a downhill, it just\nsnapped after the third aid. I was in a\nreally good group. I was in a second\ngroup. Yeah.\nAnd my my it just snapped\nand because the course were so hard, uh,\nit just completely fell off. Have you\ncrashed on the bike before? Like in\nprevious days or like you never crashed?\nNo. Very weird. I'm going to have to\nspeak with BMC or\nI'm glad you didn't go down. Yeah. Thank\nyou very much. All right. Sorry, man.\nBetter luck next time. Thank you.\nThat's a different way to mount a pump.\nYou know, I love the giant revolt.\nGot the Irish assassin\nfrom 51\ncal from chaos.\nWhat do you think this bike looks like?\nIs that a dream too?\nAlways more buses in Spain.\nLane with a buddy. Cano topstone\nro from Dubai on an Allied bike here at\nthe tracka. How was your day? Good.\nGood. Very good. Thank you. Now you've\ndone the 100 before. Yeah, you gave the\n200 a crack. Yes, it didn't go well.\nYeah, but I loved the experience. It was\ngreat. Um, I met a lot of amazing people\non the way. So, I enjoyed it. Yeah.\nWould you come back? Yes. You recommend\nthe event? Yes, 100%. Is there anything\nabout your bike you would change for\nnext time? Like bigger gears, smaller\ntires, anything like this?\nI don't know how to answer this\nquestion. Got allied\nable. All right.\nThanks, Ro. Thank you so much.\nI think Rose is winning the paint wars.\nBeautiful back rose.\nYes. No. What do you guys think?\nJohanna says it's custom but custom from\nEtsy. Sorry, I just didn't have my\ncamera going. How was your day? Amazing.\nYeah. Good race. Yeah. Have you done\nthis one before? Uh, no. Last year the\n100k I guess.\nYeah. So this year 200, next year 360.\nThat's why I don't see, but today I felt\nlike more. Yeah. Yeah. Nice.\nCongratulations. Thank you. And again,\ncongrats on the the beautiful artwork on\nthe bike. Amazing, right? I love it. And\non my black bike, I have it in gold as\nwell. And on another white one, I have\nlike pinkish whatever. Yeah. So, same\ndesign, just different colors. We got\nall thematic. I like it. Cheers. Ben\nfrom Canada. I'm Ben from Colorado. This\nis a beautiful bike. Guava. A Spanish\nbike. Yeah, it's a Spanish bike. This is\nthe Guava Spot.\nHow did you come to find this bicycle?\nUh, just they have a store here in\nJerona and I uh I met the two guys who\nown the own brand and they're super nice\nand I said like, \"Hey, let's let's do\nsomething together.\" And they were like,\n\"Yeah.\" And uh it's been a really good\nrelationship because they're really keen\nto make the best bike possible and\nthey're just always trying to what can\nwe change to make it better and uh how\ncan we tweak it and I'm so far super\nhappy with the bike. It's really light\nand it's got a a good geometry for for M\nlike definitely it's a a bit more\ninclined to off-road and so and what's\nthe other gentleman there? Nacho Suarez.\nThat's right. That's right.\nRing is wild. Also made in Barcelona.\nGemini cockpit to match. Yeah, you know\nit. Get your tattoo, too. Stay hungry.\nThanks, Ben from Canada. Thanks, Ben\nfrom Colorado.\nWe're at the court here, so it's loud.\nSorry. Here's Mad Words Spike.\nSpecialized Crux always a popular choice\nin the front end of these\nraces. Long and low stem on that bad\nboy.\nGot a big 48 ring K edge chain holder\nkeeping things tight just in case. And\nthen a big old fatty ceramic speed\noversized pulley wheel on the red\nExplorer 1046.\nreally I'm Alex from STOA. And tell me\nabout this beautiful bicycle you've just\nbrand new. So we have making the carbon\nfiber from data. So it's completely made\nin Italy. Designed in Italy. We have\nmade like a low round frame. So as you\ncan see you have all the screws for make\neverything happen. So like also the\nposition of the beon you can also move\neverything is data made by data also the\nbottle cage and handle and we wanted to\nhave like super cool road bike. So data\nthe brand new one. Sure. So uh you know\nnow it's all about coolness about speed\nabout racing gravel. There's no I think\nbackpacking now is getting a bit lower\nand as you can see it's all top of the\nrange. Also the latest RS seat post\nwheels are made by Fukram. So we try to\nmake everything in Italy. Yeah. And um\ntires are from Challenger tires. So\ntotally endmade. I love the gravina. So\nit's 40. I now I'm looking a bit more\nold school because obviously now\neveryone is riding 4550. Yes. But I love\nto be speed anyway. And some muddy uh\nsection. So uh you can be speedy and\ngrippy at the same time. Now there are\ntwo phrases on here. One I know and I\nappreciate and I do ride for coffee.\nThis I appreciate. We ride for coffee\nthere. Ride like a lag. Like like a lag.\nIn our own local dialect we come from\nLake Ko. Okay. So um la means\ninhabitants of lake ko it's not the same\nwords for lake guard or lake major they\nhave different kind of name we have is\nnot like laker. Laker is for all the\nlakes. L means or like from lake ko\nbecause we are born there. Our brand is\nfrom there. So uh we wanted to make it\nlocal to global. Aha. So that is a l is\nsomeone from that particular from that\nparticular region of lake ko not nearby\njust on the lake side. So how does a\nperson from that area ride then? Well,\nthat's why we put it because l are\nreally tough minded. So sometimes like a\nmountaineers, you know, you want you\nwant to when you want to suffer, you\nwant something, they don't care about\nanything. They just go for having it. So\nthat's reaching the top and that's it.\nRight. Did you race today? Are you\nracing tomorrow? No, I'm going to race\nuh tomorrow because today on the 200,\nyesterday on 360, we just add the team,\nour pro team just for beers and\nassistance.
