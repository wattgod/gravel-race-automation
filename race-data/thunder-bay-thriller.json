Here we have Race Director, Trevor going through a long-form course breakdown of the 2025 edition.\n\nTake on the challenge of the 62-mile multi-surface gravel grinder through the scenic Northeast Michigan countryside and trail system on September 14th, 2025. We are excited to announce that we will be part of the Michigan Gravel Race Series for the upcoming 2025 race calendar!\n\nThis fun and challenging route will take riders from rolling gravel backroads onto exciting snowmobile two-track against the picturesque Devils Lake, then weave through the woods of the Norway Ridge Pathway single/two-track system before cranking down the Alpena-Hillman Trail.\n\nWant to ride but looking for something a bit shorter? We'll have the 27-mile option as well as the NEW 16-mile option to race day.

          "transcript": "Hey everybody, this is Trevor with Rock\nCF in the Thunder Bay Thriller Gravel\nRace happening in Alpena, Michigan on\nSeptember 14th, 2025. And I'm here to\ntake you on a long form course recon\nvideo of the 62 mile, 27m, and the 16-mi\ncourse, as well as info about parking,\npacket pickup, and different key spots\non the course I want you to be aware of.\nBefore we get started, I want to give a\nquick shout out to the organization that\nI work for is the Rox CF Foundation and\nthat who is on all your bibs on a lot of\nthe marketing materials, the sponsor\nsignage. Uh, and it is a cystic fibrosis\nnonprofit based out of Michigan. And we\nactually just turned 18 years old this\npast August. And our mission is to\nprovide those living with cystic\nfibrosis around the country tools to not\nonly survive, but thrive. And by doing\nso, we create a bunch of events for\nawareness opportunities and generate\nfunding that uh goes directly back to\npatient focus programs. So 100% of the\nproceeds of this race go right back to\nthe Roxia Foundation. So I appreciate\nall of your support and thank you for\nbeing a part of this race. So without\nfurther ado, I'll get started. So I'll\nshare my screen here. All right. So\neveryone's been emailed by this point.\nIf you haven't already, you may have\njust signed up recently, but thank you\nfor watching this one. Uh I've got a PDF\nmap of the 62 mile, 27 mile, and 16 all\nput together here. But what we'll do is\nwalk through the different Strava maps\nand different Google map links of the\nspots on the course because it'll be a\nlittle bit easier for us to walk\nthrough. But on your own time, if you\ncan take a look at this course, I have\nit broken down by orange for 62, 27 will\nbe green, and the 16 is blue. And you'll\nsee the different signage that we'll go\nthrough uh during this video that's\ngoing to coordinate with that as well.\nSo, take your time. You can read through\nthis in your email. It has a lot of good\ninformation about the different roads,\ndifferent sections, uh, and gives like a\nlittle bit of a brief rundown of what to\nexpect. If I roll over to the start,\nthat's a good place to start. So, here's\na big, uh, overview of just the city of\nAlpena. And if we zoom in here on third\na is the Thunder Bay Junior High School,\nwhich is where our start and finish is\ngoing to be located. And I'll bring up\nthe parking map here.\nThat'll be a lot easier for us to follow\nhere. So, parking on race morning. Uh,\nthe only available place that you're\ngoing to be able to enter the parking\nlot once you're enter you're going down\nthird a is the first righthand turn\ndriveway into the Thunder Bay Junior\nHigh School. We will have signage there\nthat says entrance only. The other ones\nwill have exit only. Uh, and we will\nhave a parking marshall there as well\nhelping guide you, but this is the only\none that you're going to be able to\nenter first. So, go around the back of\nthe parking lot and then you can find\nthe marshall that's going to be down\nhere helping guide you to the next\nclosest spot all the way down all the\nway along these uh diagonal lots in or\nspots in front of the junior high. These\nopen lots here and then right in the\nback here as well. Uh those are going to\nfill up as you get there. So, if you\nwant to show up early, get a little bit\nof a closer spot, be my guest. But the\nstart finish line all the way on this\nwest lane will be blocked off as well as\nthe volunteer access uh to the lot back\nhere. that'll be blocked off too. Uh\nbecause we want to obviously ensure\nrider safety. We don't want too many\ncars nearby the start finish line. Uh\nwhen you do leave the parking area, uh\nyou will be using the furthest uh\nparking one uh or driveway and you'll be\nmaking a left turn and you only be able\nto make a left turn out because that's\nthe way that you go back to Bagley\nStreet to uh head out of town. So with\nthat, we're going to move on to the\nstart and finish. that is also at the\nstart uh at the Thunder Bay Junior High\nSchool as you can see with this green\nline. And you can see here we're going\nto be utilizing a side path that's going\nto take you from the parking lot. It's a\nnice big wide lane. Uh the chute is\nright back here. So you'll all be lining\nup behind the start finish line. We'll\nhave this all barriered off uh with\nscrim and stuff, so it's going to be\nreally easy to see. And then we'll have\nScrim lining you and pushing you down\nthis path before heading onto Wildcat\nCourt and then out towards the Alpena\nHillman Trail. So, I want to show you a\nquick little visual of what that's going\nto look like. So, let's drop our little\nguy over here. Uh, and you can find some\nvideos on our Instagram as well. I've\nbeen posting about the start finish and\ndifferent other places uh on our\nInstagram and Facebook too with just\nsome videos and from last year as well.\nto scroll down and see some more before\nI post them for this year, too. But\nstart finish, if you can imagine, is\nright down kind of near where this bus\nis and the shoots right behind it. This\nwill all be barricaded and it'll push\nyou to the right from your direction\ndown this side path right here. And that\nconnects over to Wildcat Court right\nhere. And you can obviously see that's\nthe going to be the direction you take\non the way back in, but we'll get to\nthat. So, you'll ride all the way down\nWildcat Court until you reach the end of\nthis culde-sac. And then we'll be making\na righthand turn onto the path right\nhere. Big important part about the start\nand finish line. And this is one that I\nwill go over by refreshing this right\nhere. And we can zoom in on this uh the\nStrava map just so you can get a better\nidea as well of how long it's going to\nbe right here. This is what the path\nsort of looks like as you're going on.\nIt's more of like a round little thing,\nbut it is mostly grass. It's hard pack\ngrass. It's a little bumpy, but\nobviously with like the tightness of\nlike this path right here that you're\ntaking on a Wildcat and the tightness\nright here, the start, and we did this\nlast year as well if you were joining\nus, is a neutral start up until you\nreach Tamarak Road right here, which is\nat approximately\nabout 3/4 of a mile into the race. Once\nyou cross Tamarak, then it's all all go\nfor it. you can like launch as much as\nyou want all the way down to Indian\nreserve. Uh but we do have a marshall\nthere helping you guide across because\nthere are still houses that are down on\nTamarak. So we just want you to be safe\nwhile you're in like a large group and\nyou're rolling all through. Uh so once\nyou reach that area, then you're more\nthan welcome to keep rolling. Uh the\nstart finish will be the same as I keep\nsaying start and finish. You do make\nyour way back through that same grass\npath just the opposite direction. That's\nobviously not neutral. You're going to\nbe more split up by that point. uh and\nit's going to be a lot easier for you to\nmake it and maneuver through this area,\nbut just wanted to make you aware of\nthat. So, moving down the trail, we're\ngoing to be moving down all the way to\nIndian Reserve Road. We'll be making a\nleft here. This is a rail trail, the\nAlpena Hillman Trail that you'll be on.\nSo, you're already on some off-road\nright there. Uh it's more of like a\nregular graded rail trail. Uh make your\nway on to Indian Reserve Road, which is\na gravel road and make your way all the\nway down. And I'll even move over to\nthis guy here because there are some\nsections that end up changing, right? So\nyou all three races will make their way\ndown Indian Reserve Road right all the\nway down to right about here. So as you\ncan see the 16 mileers are going to be\nutilizing a square of trails to make\ntheir way back up. And I'll open up 16\nright here. And you can see it here. So\nbecause y'all start a little bit behind\nthe the 62 and the 27 mileers it's to\navoid any sort of mixup so that the 62\nand the 27 are going to continue\nstraight. 16 mileers. You are going to\nbe turning around by utilizing that\ntrail right there. It is a snowmobile,\nthe kind of off-road ATV trail. It is\nall ridable. There is a little bit of\nsand or slightly like looser terrain on\nthis backstretch right here, but you'll\njust be making your way straight, making\na left turn onto there from Indian\nReserve Road, which will have signage\nthere that's going to be in blue, which\nis going to look like, let's see here.\nLet's see if I got this up. Yes. So, we\nwill have these signs out on the course\nthat are going to be pointing 16 mile\nleft, left, left, and then you'll be\nmaking your right turn to go back up\ninto your reserve. If they aren't\nlooking like this, then you will see\nthese. If you can see me up in the\ncorner right now, uh they are route\narrows that are going to be on posts and\non trees, and those are going to be in\nlike the trail sections like right now\nin the square in Norway and in the\nDevil's Lake sections. All right. So,\nand you can obviously see as we did it\nwith like the bibs, which I also have\nright here, which you can see uh onto\nthe the illustrator screen right here.\nOrange will coordinate with orange for\n62, green for green signs for the 27,\nand blue for blue signs with the 16\nmileer. So, that's why we did those all\nthose colors on this PDF as well as on\nall the signage. Uh so, it's going to\nmake a lot more sense while you're out\non course as well. So, you'll be making\nyour turnaround and heading your way\nback up north on Indian Reserve Road on\nthe other side of the road, obviously,\nand then making a right onto trail 462,\nwhich is Norway W Norway Ridge Trail,\nuh, the top of it, 462, and making your\nway all the way back up to this section\nright here. And I'm going to stop right\nthere for the 16 mileers, because this\nis actually going to be a confluence\npoint of where the 16, the 27, and the\n62 will all be riding that same section\nfrom here onto the finish line. So,\nwe'll get to there in just a moment. Uh,\nbut for you guys, I have videos on\nInstagram of right here. This is an\nawesome trail that takes you right\nthrough the woods. It's a sweet two\ntrack, a little bit wider than the two\ntrack. A lot of tree coverage and some\nof the trees have been changing lately\nup in Alpena. So, it's very beautiful.\nYou're going to love it. Uh, so let's\nmove on with the 62 mileer. And right\nnow, we are going to talk about the\nWorth Road crossing. And obviously I\nmade some notes on the PDF right here.\nUh we're going to have a lot of marshals\nhere as well, but there are two specific\nroad crossings on the court that we need\nto be on the course that we need to be\nmaking a lot more caution for and\nexercising a lot more caution for and it\nis the Indian reserve and worth road\ncrossing near the start of the race and\nthe Indian reserve and worth crossing\nleaving Devil's Lake or to Norway ridge.\nAll right, so let's talk about the first\none. So you will be coming down this\nroad, Indian Reserve, right here. So\nfrom here, you'll be heading towards\nthis intersection, Indian Reserve and\nWorth Road. So Worth Road, it's not the\nbusiest road in America or anything like\nthat, but it is an access road into the\ncity of Alpena and out. So there are\nthere is naturally a little bit more car\ntraffic. Uh so we'll have marshals here,\nhere on each corner of the road, and\nthey're going to have signs and flags\nand helping guide you appropriately\nacross the road. If there is more\ntraffic, please listen to the marshals.\nThey're there for your safety. Uh we'll\nhave you pause for just a moment before\nit is safe to move across the\nintersection because the marshals aren't\nthere to stop car traffic. We're here to\nhelp guide you safely across. Okay. So,\nonce you make your way to Worth Road,\nyou'll see signs that look like this,\nlike like look both ways. Uh caution\ncyclists crossing ahead is what the cars\nwill have on their side, so they're\naware of what's going on. Uh but you\nwill see these uh as you're approaching\nthat. Uh so you'll make your way\ncrossworth road and down Indian reserve\nroad. And once you make your way down,\nas you can see here, there is a split.\nWhat happens between the 27 mileers and\nthe 62 mileers. So the 27 mileers, you\nwill be starting obviously a few minutes\nbehind the 62 mileers. So there won't be\ntoo much of a mixup. Uh, but the green\nbibs following the green line, you will\nbe making a left turn down Precore Road,\nright? And you will see signs that look\nlike this. 62 mile will be going\nstraight, 27 mileer left. That's what\nyou're going to see as you are\napproaching Precore Road. If you have a\nblue bib, you are now off your course.\nSo, the volunteers that will be at this\nintersection will find your blue bib and\nsay, \"Please turn around and uh proceed\nup Indian Reserve Road uh to continue\nonto your course.\" All right. Uh but 62\nMi Straight 27 to the left right here.\nSo, just to show you what that looks\nlike really quick, it looks like this.\nSo, let me back up. As you're\napproaching it, there's just a little\nbit of pavement section right here\nbefore you make your way onto the gravel\nprecore. You're approaching 27 miles.\nyou will be going left that way down\npre-recore road and the 62 mileers will\nbe going straight down in your reserve\nroad until you reach the gravel and\nyou're just going to keep ripping down\nthat way. So that was this section right\nhere and I'll back right up at that\nintersection is where we're going to\nhave an aid station. So this is mile 11\nfor the 27 and the 62 mileers and it is\ngoing to be the aid station 46.2 two\nmiles in for the 62 miles. We'll get to\nthat in just a second, but 27 miles,\nthis is your main aid station. It's\ngoing to have a bathroom, bunch of\nsnacks, waters, goodies, whatever you\nneed before you start getting into more\nof the trail sections. All right, so 27\nmileers. Now, I'm going to leave you off\nright there, and I'm going to continue\non for this 62 mileers course. Okay, so\nwe're going to keep rolling down as we\nsee fit right here. So, there's that\nsplit off again, as I said. And on this\nJava profile, you could see like where\nlike little climbs are, little stuff.\nIt's not the hilliest race by any mean,\nbut there are it is pretty rolling at\nsections. It's pretty fun, but you can\ntake a look at it here. Uh you'll be\nfollowing down Indian Reserve to go down\nBeaver Lake Road. There are a couple of\nsmaller uh but still important road\nsections that we're going to have\ncrossings on that we will still have\nthese signs that are going to be like\nlook both ways. Please adhere to\nMichigan bike law uh bike law. We do\nhave some stop signs on course and we do\nexpect you to adhere to those stop\nsigns. Uh and on that note too, we can't\nbe taking up the entire road. These are\nstill open roads. It's still an open\nroad course. So please if you could ride\nclose breast about two a breast as\nyou're riding down this road and\nobviously stay to the right hand side of\nthe road at all times when you uh are\nriding down that'd be fantastic. Thank\nyou. Glad I just wanted to mention that.\nUh so you'll cross Hubard Lake Road\nhere. You'll continue down until you get\nBodin. Make your left. And you can\nfollow this obviously on your own time\non the map. Uh, make sure these are\nloaded into your GPS. Uh, you'll cross\nWolf Creek Road. We'll still have those\nlook both ways signs. And then you get\nto Bart's Road. Bart's Road, I just want\nto call it, is very fun. It's a sneaky\nhilly. There's it's you kind of just\ndrag upwards for a little while. There's\nnot a lot of climbing on the course, but\nyou can kind of see a lot of it happens\nright here. And that's your sections\nbetween Barts Road until the north part\nof like Hubard Lake area. Uh, which this\nis all going to be gravel. All this was\ngravel since you've been on In Reserve.\nuh all the way down this way. Bart Road\nis still gravel. Nice little like kind\nof wedding cake style climb, which is a\nlot of fun. Uh beautiful time of the\nyear right now, so you're going to have\nsome cool tree coverage, too. Head left\nonto Scott Road and then right onto Wolf\nCreek. This right here is paved, so\nyou'll make a right. So, obviously, look\nboth ways. Keep rolling down, cross, go\ndown Hubert. And this is the next\nsection that I want to show you really\nquick. So, you will be coming from this\ndirection right here. All right. And\nwe're going we're going. And now we're\napproaching uh Hubard Lake uh Hubert\nRoad, I believe. Yes, Hubert Road. So,\nyou're going to be entering this\nthree-way intersection right here. Okay.\nYou're going to be making a left that\nway, and you have plenty of eyes to be\nable to see down to the right, down to\nthe left. Please don't cut in front of\nany cars if there are any that are in\nroute. Uh we do have to look both ways.\nwill have the scientist is guiding you\nleft. But just so you're aware, there is\na um a a pretty like long paved section\nthat's coming up right here. And that's\nthe left turn that you're going to take\nto get onto it. So now we have a little\nbit of reprieve from the country gravel\nroads and we're going to be rolling all\nthe way down Herbert Road for a little\nbit. Let's go back over here. We cross\nHubard Lake Road. You don't have a stop\nsign. You continue straight. Then you're\ngoing to make a right onto Hoverard Lake\nRoad right here, which is just another\nsection of Hoverard Lake Road. And then\nwe get to this tighter turn, which I do\nwant to show you as well. So this is\nbefore one of my favorite spots on the\ncourse, actually. So just to give you a\nlittle bit of a visual, you're going to\nbe coming down Hoverard Lake Road just\nlike this. Down Hubard Lake Road, down\nHoverard Lake Road. You're going to be\nmaking this. It's a kind of like a wide\nleft, but then you're going to reach\nthis road right here, which is Jennison.\nWe'll have plenty of right turn arrows.\nRight turn arrows shoving you that way.\nAnd those are going to be in obviously\norange because this is for the 62\nmileers. You'll make a right turn right\nhere. I just want to call it out because\nit is a little bit of a sharper right\nturn. It's not gravel. This is still\npaved, but you are going to be making\nthis right turn onto this section right\nhere. And that is right before we get to\none of my personal favorite spots, which\nis Hickey Hill. So, Hickeyi Hill, if you\nlooked at the PDF down here, uh it is a\noff-road twotrack section that is going\nto be pretty challenging. It is shoots\nyou straight uh up this small little\ngraded climb uh through the woods. It's\nsuper cool through the woods, but it is\na little bit steeper. You're going to\nIt's all ridable. Don't worry. If you\nneed to get off and hike a bike, that's\ntotally okay. Uh, but it's a little bit\nbumpy, but it's a lot of fun. You get to\ngo up this hickey hill climb and then\nright at the top, boom, you got an aid\nstation. So, just make it up there. You\ngot your bathroom and aid station,\nwherever you feel you need up there.\nIt's a nice little treat. It's like a\nreward at the end of your uh your effort\nup Hickey Hill. It's a lot of fun. Uh,\nand at this aid station, we're going to\nhave obviously like the waters, the\ngranola bars, fig bars. Last year,\nsomeone requested pickle juice. We're\ngoing to have a jar of pickles for you.\nDon't worry, we got your back. Uh, so\nwith that being said, we're gonna move\non to this really important spot that I\nalso want to come out is called Robin\nHood Drive. So Robin Hood Drive, which\nis here's all of Hickey Hill. You can\nkind of see right here at the bottom of\nthe screen the little sharp elevation\nstick right there just kind of popping\nyou straight up this little thing. You\ncan see how sharp this downhill is,\nthough. See that right there? Uh, this\nsharp downhill is what I want to call\nout because this comes right after a\nhard effort and it doesn't take that\nlong and there's a left turn at the\nbottom. So, here's why I want to show\nyou right here. You'll be coming aid\nstation, I'm not sure if you can see\nthat far, is going to be right up at the\ntop right there at the top of this uh\nhill. But you can obviously see just\nfrom this photo, this is paved but it's\nsteep. So, you will be ripping down this\nhill, okay? And we will have slow down\nsigns plastered all over this road.\nOkay. But you're going to be going down\nthis hill, down this hill, down this\nhill. It's paved. There's obviously like\na couple of like little like softer\nwhatever chip sealish kind of like\nspots, but it's paved. But there is a\nleft turn at the bottom right here. And\nI need you to be very cognizant of it\nbecause it is a one-way stop. You have\nthe stop and this traffic on Bennett\ndoesn't. It is not a busy road, luckily.\nand we will have a marshall down there,\nbut it is a left turn and you are\ncrossing obviously their lane. So, we\nneed you to be able to slow down in\nenough time and be able to take a look\nfrom like where you're going uh to\nobviously not impede traffic and be\nsafe. So, you'll be making a left turn\nhere and then going up Bennett Road. So,\ngoing up Bennett Road and obviously saw\nlike a little bit of pavement down here.\nThis section on the 62 mileer is where\nmajority of the pavement happens that's\non the entire course is around Hubard\nLake because it is obviously a little\nbit more developed. Uh but you still\nhave the fun of Hickey Hill thrown in\nthere too. So don't worry about it. It's\na nice little reprieve before and after.\nUh you follow down Hubard Lake Road\nuntil it turns into Spruce and you'll\nmake a left onto Labonte. Labonte Road\nis an awesome uh graded gravel road that\nyou're going to be ripping pretty much\nall the way up until you come to a T at\nGerky Road. It does turn into another\nroad named called Corovo uh at some\npoint. I think when you cross Nicholson\nHill right here, uh you make a left onto\nGerky Road, also gravel. You cross\nSpruce. This will have a look both way\nsign right here because you also have\nthat oneway traffic. I'm going to\nreiterate again. uh be sure to stop and\nuh file Michigan bike law. And then you\ncome to another T. You'll make a right\nonto Indian Reserve Road. And I'm sure\nthat sounds familiar because you are\nalready on it. You are going to come\nlike ripping up this heading north\ninstead of south. And you kind of see\nit's a big bulb shape right here. And\nthen we come back to this uh location.\nYou're going to be heading north. And\nnow you are going to be turning right on\nprecore past that aid station again that\nyou just passed at mile 11. As you can\nsee on the PDF here, aid station with\nbathroom is mile 11 and mile 46.2.\nYou're at 46.2 at this point. And you're\nabout to enter a lot of the fun. Now\nwe're going to pick back up with our\n62 and our 27 mileers. Our 27 and the 62\nfollow a lot of the same course. As you\ncan kind of see from the Strava map, the\n27 is basically just the top section of\nthe 62. So you will be following the\nsame from now on. So as I go forward\nnow, 2762, I'm talking to you. 16, I\ndidn't forget about you. We're going to\nget to you. Don't worry. So going onto\nthis section, you turn Oh, wrong one.\nYou're going onto Precore Road. Make a\nright. Stop at the eight station if you\nneed to. Water fig bars. jar pickles.\nAnd then you're going to be making a\nleft onto Spruce. This is another one of\nthose sections where there could be car\ntraffic that's going on Spruce or\nanything. It's like I said, not a crazy\nbusy road, but it is one of those access\nroads that actually connects to Worth\nRoad eventually. So, you'll be making a\nleft onto that. You will be crossing\ntraffic. We'll have signage, but we'll\nalso have a marshal there. It's going to\nbe helping you guide across as well. Uh,\nthis aid station will remind you of\nthat, too. Once you go down Spruce Road,\nyou will be getting close to Devil's\nLake Trail, which is this one right\nhere. So, you'll be coming down Spruce\nright here, and then you'll make a right\nturn into this trail right here. This is\nDevil's Lake Trail. And we've got we're\ngoing to have plenty of signs right\nthere that are going to be these orange\nsigns as well as a a stake sign in the\nground, too, that's going to be pushing\nyou this way. And this is what begins\nprobably one of my personal favorites of\nthe entire course, which is Devil's Lake\nTrail. So, Devil's Lake is\napproximately,\nlet's see, 13 to 21. So, it's about 7\nand 12 miles of awesome snowmobile trail\nthrough the woods of Northeast Michigan.\nIt is very cool. Uh, and I'm going to\nbreak it down into a few parts for you.\nIf you're still here, thank you for\njoining me. So, this first section of\nDevil's Lake, I would say from the time\nyou make a right turn into it until you\nget to the bottom right here. So, that's\napproximately a mile and a halfish or\nso, or two mile, like mile and a half,\nmile and three/4ers. This section I\nusually call more of the landmine\nsection. This is where you're going to\nfind because it's like the entryway for\na lot of the ATVs and like the\nsnowmobile trail and stuff. There's\ngoing to be more like potholes and a\nlittle bit more like deeper like\nsections where there could be like a\nlittle bit of standing water inside of a\npothole and stuff. It all you can ride\naround all of it. You do not need to\nride through any pothole or any water if\nyou do if you have the clear line. Uh,\nbut since you're doing a ride, a race,\nand there's going to be people around\nyou, uh, there are going to be some\npotholes. Most of them are pretty like\nwide lip, so you're going to be able to\nlike kind of roll through them and out\nof them. Totally okay. But you like\nyou're going to need to be uh fully\naware and it's not a time that you're\ngoing to want to take your hands off the\nbars. Like you're going to be riding uh\nyour bike and there's going to be bumps\nand there's going to be some roots,\nthere's going to be some potholes and\nstuff, but that's honestly part of the\nfun of it and it's it is a really fun\npart of the course. So the first two\nmiles or first mile and a half a little\nbit I'd say more of like the potholes\nare apparent. Then once you make the\nleft turn at the bottom and you'll feel\nyourself make the left turn. It's a\nlittle bit downhill through here. Uh you\nwill then start seeing on probably this\nnext say from mile 50 to 54. So probably\nfor the next uh I'd say three like\nmiles. So about five miles in about\nthree miles you're going to have pretty\nsmooth sailing. There's really no issue\nfor this entire section right here.\nThere's like very little amounts of like\nchunkier gravel, I'd say, like chunkier\nrock that's put down. Uh the whole first\nsection is a lot more hard pack dirt in\ngravel, whereas this one has some more\nsections of like you could see like a\nlittle bit of like a looser gravel\nsection or very like very short amount\nof time like with like a couple meters\nof sand or like lighter stuff like that.\nUh but this whole section is pretty\nsolid and there's not a lot of root\ncoverage or anything in there. Then for\nthe last part going from the probably\nlike the last two miles to make that\nabout seven uh is where you see a couple\nmore of the sections of the sand. So a\nfew people have been asking about it.\nWhen I say sand, I don't mean like deep\ndeep beach sand or anything like that.\nIt's lighter sand that's on top of hard\npack gravel and hard pack dirt there. It\nI'm not going to say it's not there. And\nif you stop pedaling through it and\nyou're going a little bit slower, then\nit could be a little bit more of an\nissue. If you're using a thinner tire, I\nlike I would recommend having something\ncloser to like the minimum 38, but I've\nbeen doing it on 40s and it's totally\nokay. 45s even are great. If you have a\nmountain bike, sure, like you want some\nmore comfort and traction, that's\nawesome. All of this course is doable on\na gravel bike, but the little bits of\nsand section kind of come in this last\nlittle bit, I'd say. And when I say like\nlittle bit of sand, it's probably about\nbetween five to 15 meter sections of\nsand at a time. Nothing like you're\ndoing like two miles straight through\nthe beach or anything like that. So,\njust want to make you aware of that. Uh\nit's all ridable. Then moving on, you\nare going to be exiting Devil's Lake\nonto Worth Road, which is that golden\nword that we've been saying a lot, word\nfor worth. You'll be making a righthand\nturn onto here. And here's a visual. So\nthere's the exit of Devil's Lake making\na right turn and you are going to have\ncones right here and a Marshall is going\nto be guiding you. Cones are going to be\nkeeping you on the gravel shoulder. It's\na huge gravel shoulder and look right\nthere. You can already see where you're\ngoing. All right, so you're going to be\nfollowing this straight on this gravel\nshoulder and you're going to be\nfollowing these cones. I'm sure you just\nsaw this sign. It just said\nNorway Ridge Pathway. That's where we're\ngoing. Another favorite of mine on the\ncourse. Uh, right about here\nis where the cones are going to stop.\nYou have a mar marshall here, a marshall\nhere, and one inside of Norway. And\nthey're going to help guide you across\nsafely. It's the same thing. If there is\ncar traffic that's coming there back and\nforth, marshals aren't there to stop\ncars. They're here to help you get\nsafely across. So, if you are asked to\npause for just a moment, cars, it\ndoesn't take long for a car to pass.\nJust please adhere to the marshall's\ndirections. You know, be nice. You still\ngot plenty of racing to go at this\npoint. Uh so you'll be making that cross\nwhen you can do so safely and then\nentering Norway Ridge Pathway which is a\nreally cool section. By the way, Devil's\nLake Norway uh Hickey Hill, I've got\nvideos on our Instagram and our\nFacebook, Thunder Bay Thriller Gravel\nRace that showcase all of those sections\nand or at least videos of it. Uh and you\ncould see videos even from last year\nwhen I took it for last year's race too\nand this year. So check them out when\nyou have a second. It's a lot of fun.\nNorway is a little bit more I want to\nsay\nuh slightly more technical than Devil's\nLake. It is still more of the kind of\nlike a two-track system, but there are a\nlittle bit more twists and turns. And\nthere's a couple more sections where\nthere's like varying terrain where it's\nlike, oh, you might be on grass for a\nlittle bit. Oh, now you're on hard pack\ndirt. There's a couple of small\nboardwalk sections which are really\ncool. Uh there's a couple of like\nlighter, looser sections of like kind of\nstraw and stuff, but it's super cool.\npine uh pine trees lining basically the\nentire time going over some creeks and\nstuff like that. A lot of fun. Uh a lot\nof bobbing and weaving. Uh you can't fit\na ton of bikes next to each other, so\nyou're going to be probably more of like\na single file or like two people at a\ntime can kind of go through some spots,\nbut single file is probably what it's\nnaturally going to be. Uh there are some\nroots in here and stuff. Uh during\nNorway and Devil's Lake, you like you're\ngoing to have to keep your brain on.\nIt's not it's not a time where you can\njust like kind of mindlessly not look at\nthe ground or like look at your\nsurroundings and look at the people\naround you. You're going to be want to\nbe calling out stuff for other people.\nYou're going to want to be doing uh you\nknow like calling out potholes when\nsand's happening. Be be helpful to each\nother. It's going to make the race\nexperience a lot better. Uh so you're\ngoing to make your way through Norway\nand then you make a nice right turn, a\nleft turn. You can kind of see way down\nhere there's a nice little sharp bump\nright in the middle of uh this Norway\nspot which is pretty funny. Uh, it's a\nlot of fun to do, too. You'll be making\nyour way up Norway and then through this\nsection that's going to go onto trail\nnumber 462. And that is where the\nconfluence of 27, 16, and the 62 mileers\nwill all be riding the same section all\nthe way to the finish line. Obviously,\nat different times because it's uh\ndifferent starting times and different\nrace distances. The 62s will be coming\nthrough here much later than 27 and 16,\nbut you'll be making your way down.\nWell, let me back up right here. Uh, at\nthe top of Norway, just so you are\naware, there is a gate that you do have\nto go around. We'll have it marked.\nThere's plenty of arrows. There's like a\nlittle wooden boardwalk you go over. Uh,\ngo around the gate and then you'll just\ncontinue your way down this twotrack\nsection. Once you get here, you'll make\na right turn on trail 462. And then this\nis another section that I've been\ngetting a lot of uh questions about. And\nit is the this is the actual uh fun part\nof like the sand. So, it comes in right\nat the last bit. You've got about three\nmiles until your finish line or so, and\nit is your last challenge of the course,\nand it is a slightly deeper section of\nsand. I did post a video to our\nInstagram recently. It is totally\nridable if you're able to carry speed\nthrough this section. Uh if not, a lot\nof people hiked a bikediked it. It's And\nyou could see how short it is. It is\nfrom 59.8 to about 59.9. It's about\n150ish meters of sand and I'd say about\nonly 25 to 40 m of it is like the\ntougher spot. It's a little bit deeper\nand the tough part is you make a right\nturn to get onto that section. So, it's\na little bit harder to carry speed. Uh\nso, just be aware of it. It's a lot of\nfun and it's a great challenge just two\nmiles, three miles out from the finish\nline. From there, you're going to be\nfollowing the same path that you were\njust on at the start of the race, the\nAlpena Hillman Trail, all the way back\ndown the grade to that same grass\nsection, that little single track spot\nthat takes you back onto Wildcat Court.\nYou're going to ride that all the way\ndown to that same section that you're\ngoing to make a left turn on, and then\nyou're going to make a bomb straight for\nthe finish line. The finish shoot is\ngoing to be right behind you. And then\nafterwards, we're going to have uh we're\ngoing to have food for you. We're going\nto have some vendors. Uh we got uh\napparel brands. We have Harborside Cycle\nis going to be there with their um their\nbike setup and stuff like that too. So\nit's going to be a lot of fun. We'll\nhave some merch there as well too for\nRox CF and some extra Thunder Bay\nThriller stuff. Uh and that's also we're\ngoing to be doing uh all the awards and\nthe awards times I'll post onto our bike\nreg as well as emailing it out to you\ntoo. Uh but yeah, if you have any\nquestions about the course or anything\nlike that, uh let me know. You can email\nme back at any of those uh emails I've\nbeen sending out. Like I said, the\nbiggest things are orange for 62,\ngreen for 27, and blue is for the 16.\nOur packet pickup is at Harborside Cycle\nand Sport on Saturday, September 13th.\nThat is from 10:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. And\nif you've made it this far, I got to\ninvite you. We have an awesome sponsor,\nHopside Brewery downtown Alpena, that\nwe're going to be hosting the Chiller\nfor the Thriller. And that is going to\nbe a $15 ticketed event. You can\npurchase it on the bike regge or you can\npurchase it there on site. You just find\nme or one of our Rox CF team members.\nThey'll guide you to me. We can square\nup uh get some great uh I believe it's a\nawesome pasta dinner and stuff like that\ntoo. And uh I will be there to answer\nany and all questions regarding the\ncourse, any sections that you uh have\nany interest in learning more about and\nall that good stuff. at pack of pickup\nis where you're also going to get your\nyour t-shirt, uh your bibs, you'll have\nif you did purchase dinner, you'll have\na ticket already for that.

          "transcript": "hey what's up everybody this is Trevor\nwith rock CF in the Thunder Bay Thriller\ngravel race and I here to go through you\nquickly a few of the key areas and spots\non course to be aware of uh like a\ncouple of the stops where the eight\nstations are and all that good stuff so\nright here let me share my screen and I\ncan run through these with you right now\nall right so we're going to be talking\nmainly about the 62 m course but it\nactually encompasses everything that has\nthe 27 M as well uh as you can see here\nthis top section right there is actually\nthe entire 27 M course uh so the 62\nreally just adds in sort of this bulb at\nthe bottom that touches up near the\nnorthern part of hubard Lake so I'll\nkind of start by the the start finish\nwe'll go over parking really quick uh\njust to show you a layout of that and\nwhere you're going to be parking as well\non Race morning uh the start shoot and\nthe few key areas where we're going to\nhave volunteers stationed at uh where\nthe roads just have slightly busier\nintersection uh just for Rider safety so\nthere's going to be a couple volunteers\nthere that are going to be helping you\nget guided across on Race morning so\nfirst and formost I want to go through\nthe parking map right here oh there we\ngo so parking I know it looks a little\nconfusing right here but you'll be\nentering off of third AV so Third Avenue\nis what runs off of baggley Street you\ncould see right here if I exit out of\nthis one right\nhere most people we staying either at\nthe Alpo Resorts or over downtown in the\nholiday in or if you're camping say at\nthe fairgrounds over here you'll be\nentering the thunderbay junior high\nschool via third AV okay so on the\nparking map you could see this furthest\neast driveway is going to be the only\nentrance that we're going to be\nutilizing for Riders to come in so\nyou'll drive your car in we'll have one\nvolunteer station right here guiding you\nup and what you're going to want to do\nif you get there we'll kind of open it\naround 6:00 a.m. or so uh all the way up\nuntil race time if you get there earlier\nyou feel free to grab your spot but the\nvolunteer will be there at 6 they'll\nsend you and there'll be arrows on the\nground too all the way up and around the\nspot of the lot and then you'll come\ndown here go in front of the school and\nwe'll have arrows on the ground like I\nsaid guiding you here until you reach\nthe volunteer at the very end there who\nis going to try and direct you straight\ninto the nearest spot closest to the\nstarting line so the earlier you get\nthere the better spot you get um so you\njust follow the arrows all the way\naround until you park we'll use these\ntwo bottom Lots right here this entire\nstretch uh and then as we line up all\nthese diagonal uh Lanes then we'll get\ninto uh the larger lot over to the far\nright uh that's going to be the last lot\nthat we'll use but if you would like to\nhave a little more space uh feel free to\npark there earlier that's totally okay\none quick note I'd like to make is that\nthere is going to be a volunteer lot in\nthe back that only volunteers and race\norganizers will have access to and\nthat'll be the right turn that runs\nagainst the Finish Line uh not with the\nfinishers not on the start finish or\nanything like that it's only for\nvolunteers for beforehand uh you won't\nbe able to enter the driveways that are\nfurthest from the uh Eastern driveway so\nno cars can come in here or there and\nthere's only one way out the furthest\nwest one uh so yeah that's about parking\nthe start and finish line is going to be\non this West Lane it's a very long Lane\nuh and it's going to be shoot for the\nstart and finish you'll line up all the\nway back here all down here you'll start\nand then later on you finish and you'll\ncome right back through the same way you\ncome and uh over up top by the packet\npickup all the post race food vendors\nall that's going to be set up in this\nbat lot right here so once you do Park\njust make your way up this lane or this\nsidewalk up top if you need to pick up\nyour packet still it's going to be up\nhere uh we're going to have some great\npost race food by thunderbit catering\nand build your own protein bowl it's\ngoing to be delicious uh as well as our\nbicycle vendor T from STS Harbor Side uh\nand like even the merch tables and all\nlike that so moving on from parking now\nlet's talk about the start and finish\nthe start and finish lane is going to be\non like I said this West Side all of us\nare going to be staged right in this\nback shoot right here and the 8 a.m. for\nthe start of the 62 Mile and it's two\none sorry then it's 8:05 a.m. for the 27\nmile just so then we can have both waves\ngo out and not get you know knocked over\nby each other other once we get to the\nsplit section and so the 62 MERS will\nhave enough time to get out uh get out\nahead a little bit of the 27 MERS who\ncould be going a little bit quicker than\nsome of the 62s uh since it's a shorter\nCourse once the race starts you'll start\nand make a right right before wild uh\nthird AV you'll make a right turn onto\nthis gravel path then right onto Wildcat\ncore and then we actually have a path\nthat'll lead you right onto the Alpena\nhman Trail and then out you go right\nonto the course one super important note\nthat I want to make very apparent now is\nwe are actually going to be doing a\nneutral start through this initial\nsection right here because things are\nquite a bit tighter so once you start in\nthis Lane and you get down this gravel\nway and up through this alley on this\nlittle bit narrower Trail right here\nonce we get out of there and closer to\nTamarac road which I can point out right\nhere for you sorry I'm Ram a little bit\nright here\nyou'll exit the school enter through the\npath right here which you'll have on\nyour GPS computers we'll have one\nvolunteer on tamarak road as well as two\nof our local cyclists that are going to\nbe leading the group to tamarak which is\nonly8 uh up the road so less than a mile\nup the road once we cross right here\nthat's when the race is full-fledged\nFlags drop everyone can go for it uh\nit's just to get everyone in line and\nthrough that initial tight Trail section\nsafely and all together and then we can\nget on with proceedings so um just got\nto hold up for just a little bit just to\nmake sure everyone gets through these\ntighter section safe because it is\nreally right off the gun and then on the\nway back you'll notice it's going to be\nnice and fun almost like psycho cross\nfinish you you pop off right off the\nrail trail you take the same exact way\nback down the culde saac of Wildcat\nCourt we'll have cones there on the\nright hand side so that you'll be able\nto follow in through there uh and then\nwe'll take that tight left to tight left\non that gravel thing nice and Technical\nit's very cool if you need a little bit\nmore space or a little more time just\ntake it a little bit easier through that\nturn because it could be it is on gravel\nwe'll brush it off as much as we can but\nuh we'll get you through there and then\nstraight shot to the finish uh right up\nthat lane so that's the initial on the\nuh the initial start of the race and\nthen the next spot that I want to talk\nabout moving on you come all the way\ndown the Hillman trail pass a couple\nlittle offshoot Trails nothing too\nserious besides that tamarak initially\nand then we'll make this left turn on\nthe Indian reserve Road well we'll have\nanother volunteer there to help guide\nyou straight uh to the left you'll be\nturning left off the trail you'll be\nripping down this beautiful freshly\ngrayed Indian reserve one of my favorite\nspots of the whole race and I'm so glad\nthat 27 and the 62 get to hit it because\nit's a gorgeous line of pine trees all\nthe way down super cool rugged\npicturesque you'll wind it all the way\ndown these are very natural Curves in\nthe road uh you won't get lost right\nthere and we'll have arrows on the\nground the entire time don't worry\nand then we come down at about mile I\nbelieve this is exactly Mile 10 or so\n10.2 and this is the initial worth road\ncrossing if you're from the area you\nknow Worth Road has a little bit more\ncar trafficked every so often not as\nmuch on the weekends but just to be\ncompletely certain that we're getting\neveryone across right here as you saw on\nthe map key that I've been sending out\nbeforehand we had those two very\nspecific Road crings on cross that\nwill'll be exercising the greater\ncaution and it is the first worth road\ncrossing and the second worth road\ncrossing we'll get to the second one in\na minute let's talk about this first one\nwe'll have three volunteers at this\nCrossing this is what it's going to look\nlike right here you'll be ripping I know\nit's a little grainy this picture is\nfrom 2009 on Google Earth but I promise\nthat's still gravel right there you'll\nbe coming straight down heading\nSouthbound on uh Indian reserve road\ntowards this Worth Road okay you could\nsee there's a bit of a curve that's\ngoing to be to your left and to your\nright there's also a little bit of a\ncurb so we're going to have three\nvolunteers 1 two and three that are\ngoing to be stationed here and they're\ngoing to have a stop sign and a yield\nsign and they're going to have be the\nspotters and they'll be the ones that'll\nlet you know when it's safe to cross so\njust letting you know a heads up there\nmay be a moment where you're asked to\npause momentarily if there are cars\ncoming because this is an Open Road\nCourse and there is no stop sign right\nhere we can't technically run out in the\nroad and say stop stop stop to these\ncars uh we need to allow traffic to come\nthrough and then we'll like we when it's\nsafe we'll bring you all through uh this\nis going to be a larger group at this\npoint because it's only 10 miles in uh\nso once we all come through here uh\nsafely then you'll be able to go right\non your way just ripping straight\nsouthbound down Indian reserve and\nthat's B both for the 62 and the 27 mile\nRiders all right so just a heads up if\nyou see a volunteer that's asking you to\nstop please please please listen to them\nthey're only telling you to stop because\nthere is a car coming down the road all\nright so thank you in advance so\ncontinuing\non we are going to get to the split so\nthis is actually where our first aid\nstation is at and it's Indian reserve\nand pre-ore Road so you'll be heading\ndown this way Southbound on Indian\nreserve and our 27 MERS are going to\nturn to the left there's an aid station\ngoing to be on this corner right here\nit's going to have water granola bars\nand light first aid uh and they'll be\nsending you down here to your left there\nright but your left all the way down\npreor Road and then you're going to turn\nleft on Spruce and head all the way to\nDevil's Lake and Norway and all that fun\nstuff the 62 MERS are going to continue\nstraight if you are in the 62 you'll\nhave an orange bib if you're in the 27\nyou'll have a green bib there will be\narrows on the ground fluorescent orange\nand fluorescent green arrows as well as\nstaks that say 60 2 to the straight 27\nto the left uh so please adhere those\nsigns uh like I said ahead of time few\nthe emails be sure to download these\nthese straa files uh I have them on the\nwebsite where you register as well as in\nyour emails too where you can go and you\njust have to Star uh on straa to get it\nto your bike computer or you can\ndownload the GPX file directly from\nthere you can load it onto if your\ngarment needs it your wahoo your phone\nall that kind of good stuff we'll also\nhave q sheets for everybody too with a\nmap um but if you have the Wahoo or the\nGarmin or the Hammerhead whatever it may\nbe please download ahead of time uh but\nyes this is the split and where the\nfirst eight station is at so we're going\nto continue with the 62 milers now all\nright so you'll continue down we'll turn\nright on to Beaver Lake Road we'll have\narrows and signs at each of these turns\nso you know uh whether it be on the\nground or on the the stake signs to the\nside of the road and you'll follow down\nBodine to cleave Road this wolf peek\nroad we will have a sign says um slow\ndown look both ways cuz there are a few\nof these intersections that aren't the\nfour ways there are the two ways Wolf\nCreek isn't incredibly busy or anything\nlike that but we'll still have the sign\nright there just remember we have to\nfollow the rules of the road you know\nMichigan bicycle law we can't just be\nblowing through stop signs constantly or\nanything like that uh so be mindful you\nknow you you've rid before be safe right\nand we come down Barts Road actually I\nshould say upart so because this is\nwhere one of those wedding cakes wedding\ncake Hills are and it's very fun uh best\nof luck and then we'll come down Scott\nRoad right here and then to Wolf Creek\nRoad we'll make a right turn onto that\nuh to Hubert this turns paved right here\nuh this is where the next uh map I want\nto point out to you so this is what it's\ngoing to look like as you are coming\ndown Hubert Road so you'll be coming\nfrom this direction you'll be heading\nstraight and this is going to be hubard\nLake uh right past those trees you can\nobviously see you have quite a lot of\nvisibility up to the left of any\nincoming traffic that way and to the\nright you'll be making a left turn here\njust like this but just be mindful of\nany cars coming either way we'll have\nsigns and everything posted as well too\nfor any oncoming traffic and arrows\nletting you know where to go but once\nyou get on Hubert you know please stay\nthe two a breast utilize the shoulder we\nhave like the gravel section here we\nalso have on the other side of this\nwhite line you'll be heading uh East\ndown Hubert right here and this is kind\nof where the initial uh change in the\ncourse actually happened too uh\nbeforehand that happened in April rather\nthan turning on a bear Springs Road and\ngoing down this way it had a little bit\ntoo much private property and everything\nlike that so unfortunately we had to\nchange it but I think you're going to\nlove the change we head down Hubert road\nto hubard Lake Road North hubard Lake\nRoad right here this is all still paved\nand then you get to a sharper right-and\nturn on Jennison Drive which then leads\nyou straight onto hickey Hill so hickey\nHill let's see if I can find it right\nhere is a gravel slash uh\nlet's see here see if you can see it\nfrom here you'll make this turn to the\nright that's the bit of a sharper turn\nright here and you'll turn down that way\nand hickey Hill entrance is right down\nthere you can't really see it too well\nright there because it's a little bit\nblurry uh but it's\na gravel and Sandy two track that goes\nstraight up so you're going up this nice\nsteep climb right here it's a lot of fun\nif you got to hop off and run got to hop\noff and run but it's never say it was\ngoing to be easy it's an awesome awesome\nsection that goes through the woods of\nNorthern hover Lake Forest Preserve uh\nTownship and then you'll pop out onto\nRobin Hood Drive at Mile 30 and boom\nhere is your next aid station so this is\nthe furthest south point on the entire\nrace we have an aid station it is almost\nexactly the halfway we'll have uh a tent\nwith Waters light first aid and granola\nbars set up right here uh so if in case\nyou need any of that right after you get\noff of hickey Hill here's your spot and\nthen one section I want to point out to\nyou as well is this spot right here is\nRobin Hood Drive Robin Hood Drive is\nvery fun it's a very fast descent but\nit's not very short Li\nshortlived uh or it is shortlived and at\nthe bottom you do need to make a left\nturn on to Bennett Road okay and there's\na stop sign there we'll have signs that\nsay slow down turn ahead and we will\nhave a marshall at the bottom here but\nyou get you can go down but you have to\nbe very mindful that at the bottom it's\na t you know so hold on to those breaks\nif you're not as confident with going\ndown a little bit of sharper Hill you\ncan see it right down here um\n14% like 9 to 14% straight down right so\nuh if you know what that is in bike ccal\nterms it means steep down so be careful\nbe mindful right there we'll make that\nleft turn onto Bennett Road this is\npaved back on a hover Lake Road this\none's also paav please utilize that\nright hand shoulder right uh because\nthere are like I said it's still open\nroad so there will be cars eventually\nsort of thing that will be going around\nyou uh or potentially so just follow the\nroad you know be mindful don't be going\ninto the you know the middle yellow line\nand all that kind of good stuff but then\nwe'll make this left turn on a Spruce\nRoad and this goes right back into\ngravel and I know they just regraded it\nso you got some nice some nice chunky\nstuff right over here so Levante to CaRu\nroad is what it's called you'll follow\nthis all the way straight up right here\nyou'll cross Nicholson Hill Road which\nthis is another sign that you'll have a\nlook both ways sign for you uh till giry\nRoad make a left on giry same thing on\nSpruce uh it's not a four-way\nintersection so it'll have the stop sign\nwith to look both ways sign right there\nuh and all these arrows are going to be\norange that you'll be following down\nhere so you won't get lost if you have\nthe computer out and you're being\nmindful of the arrows that are going to\nbe on course they'll be on the ground\nvery fluorescent I did put a picture of\nthem on our Instagram in case you're\nwondering uh and then you'll make a\nright onto Indian reserve road which we\nwere on beforehand uh nice and gravel up\nthrough here there was a little bit of a\npave section earlier right before the 27\nsplit uh so you won't be hitting that\nbasically at the split is where it turns\ngravel so you'll heading back North and\nthen you'll make a right turn where the\n27 MERS made a left turn earlier in the\nday and you'll be following from there\non out the rest of the course of the 27\nmile so you'll make a right onto Precor\nRoad left onto Spruce which right here\nlet's talk about\nout this is you can kind of see here\nit's a little bit of a sharper left turn\nright there so there's a little bit of\nblindness so we do have a marshall\nthat's going to be stationed right there\nyou could see you'll be coming whoops\nyou'll be coming down from here pre-ore\nRoad and you'll be making this left\nright there we'll have a marshall\nstationed right here with a stop sign\nhe's going to be looking that way or\nthey'll be looking that way and this way\nsouthbound Northbound but you'll be\nhaving to cross this southbound traffic\nlane to then head north so then you\nstart heading north and you'll be\nutilizing this wider shoulder right\nthere if you can uh remember two Riders\nare breast when around these paved roads\nbe you know be mindful of any cars or\nany traffic or anything like that but\nthen you'll be heading north and that's\nwhen you start going straight right into\nDevil's Lake Trail so I'm going to show\nyou really quick what Devil's Lake trail\nentrance looks like it is right here and\nit is a quick right turn almost looks\nlike a driveway we'll have plenty of\nsignage they telling you right turn\nright turn right turn ahead slow down\nright turn ahead uh but you'll be\nentering Devil's Lake this way and then\na lot of the more fun begins because\nthen it becomes a lot more Trail heavy\nuh during this back half of the race uh\nthere are some more like crater is sort\nof larger I don't want to say potholes\nbut just like divots in the ground in\nhere there were was a little bit of rain\nover the past couple days not much at\nall but there is some water in here\nthere's plenty of ways to get around it\nthere may be a couple of like slightly\nsandier spots because they have been\ndoing a little bit of logging uh a few\nmonths ago but everything's completely\nridable through Devil's Lake it's a lot\nuh more of a tame Trail the further in\nyou go uh it's very beautiful right now\nthe things are getting beautiful just be\nmindful of roots any potholes uh any\nlike water that kind of good stuff but\nyeah it's going to be a really good time\nonce you get through Devil's Lake the\nnext very important section happens\nabout 7 miles later after you enter and\nthat is the final worth road crossing\nokay so right here is the image of it so\nyou can see right here there's obviously\na couple cars that way uh this is the\nexit of Devil's Lake which you can see\nright here I'll zoom in on this a little\nbit it's a it's sort of a chicane right\nso you'll be heading right for about\n100 about 100 m and then you'll be\nmaking a left into Norway Ridge pathway\nwe will have have three to four\nvolunteers at this section where they'll\nbe guiding you right you'll be actually\nuh we're coning this entire white line\nso you're going to be staying on this\ngravel shoulder the entire time we've\nbeen doing gravel all day guys so don't\nworry about it so we'll be staying on\nthis gravel shoulder not onward Thro and\nyou'll be on this right hand side\nthere'll be cones on this white line so\nyou'll be on this right side and then\nright here we'll have another volunteer\nwith the stop sign and another volunteer\nright here for spotting and we'll be\nguiding you left across the traffic\nacross Worth Road into Norway okay this\nis another one of those spots that I\nstressed on the map here that we've been\nsending out uh that is very important uh\nto adhere to the advice and the guidance\nof the marshals because they're there to\nhelp you out they're here to help you\nnot get hit by a car at intersections\nand uh it's all about Rider safety so if\nyou are asked to pause just know it's\nmomentarily\nand you will be able to continue on your\nway okay so you'll be riding that right\nhand shoulder up Worth Road as I said\nright here and then you'll be making a\nleft turn into the parking lot of Norway\nand then you go boom right into the\ntrail which will have posted signs all\nthe way through uh for the next few\nmiles you're following it's basically\nlike the cross country ski Trail for the\nmajority of it uh taking the connector\nand then you get to Trail\n462 which Trail 462 is what connects\nNorway to the Alpena Hilman Trail and it\nis Sandy you're gonna you're gonna get\nsome sand in there it's not a lot it\nlasts for about in total I'd say about\nuh just over a quarter mile under a half\naround a half mile of like actual like\ndeeper sand this section right here is\nlike very easy to ride through uh it's\nthis spot right here very easy to ride\nthrough sand there's a better line on\nthe right side for all my Out of Towners\nif you want to know right side's a\nlittle bit firmer on this side SE right\nhere uh but then you make a right hand\nturn next to the power lines and you go\nthrough uh the sand once more it is like\nI said very easily navigable you won't\nget lost back here but just know that\nthere will be some deeper sand that you\neither going to have to ride through\nkeep pedaling or you're going to have to\njust hop off and run real quick but it's\nkind of a nice fun divisive little part\nof the race because you're about a mile\nand a half out from the finish at that\npoint and then you'll come screaming\ndown the Alpena Hillman Trail uh we'll\nhave a volunteer at tamarak and and uh\nyou'll make that right turn the same\nexact trail that you came off of that\nColac you'll make right back in so you\ncome in and it's kind of like single\ntracky little bumpy pretty fun you'll\ncome in then you hop on the Colac pave\nall the way through watch your turn on\nthis left turn back into the finish and\nthen another left and then boom\nfinishing this is a remember this is a\nlittle bit of a gravel section so we'll\nhave a volunteer here like let you know\nkind of slow down a little bit so you\ndon't slide out or anything but uh we'll\nbe using push Broms just to get all the\nlooser stuff off the top of it so yeah\nthat's basically the course and those\nare all the high Contex spots if you\nhave any questions you can email me at\nTrevor lef.org\nor uh you can message us on Facebook or\nInstagram I know this was a long video\nuh but if you made it to the end I\nreally appreciate you uh checking out\nall these high contact spots I really\nhighly advise you just look at that map\none more time uh I'll email it to you\nguys all again and yeah super excited uh\njust for more information too the the\npacket pickup at Harborside cycl sport\nin downtown Alpena will be on Friday\nfrom 10:00 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. I know a\nlot of people are coming from out of\ntown so you may not be able to make it\nto that packet pickup earlier to just\nknow from 6:00 a.m. till race time at\n8:00 a.m. probably a little bit before\ncloser to like 7:50 a.m. we will be\nhaving the race day pack a pickup uh in\nthe back of that parking lot as I said\nuh before so yeah that's all I got for\nyou right now uh I'll be posting more\nvideos of all these spots uh on the\nground just so you see a little bit of a\nbetter idea of it but that's all I got\nfor you take care",

Riders describe the course as having much more diversity than expected, with two-track sections that feel like obstacle courses with more challenges than anticipated. The race offers 62-mile, 27-mile, and 16-mile distance options, with the longer course adding a southern loop near Hubbard Lake. Parking opens at 6 a.m. at Thunder Bay Junior High School via Third Avenue, with early arrival recommended for closer spots to the start/finish line. Volunteers are stationed at busier intersections for rider safety. The race attracts around 170 participants and features strong community support, with riders helping each other on course when mechanical issues arise. The event benefits the Rock CF Foundation, a cystic fibrosis nonprofit, with 100% of proceeds supporting patient programs."
