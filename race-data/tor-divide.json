Mid-May in the Peak District means you're gambling on British spring weather, which could be anything from snow to scorching sun within the same 32-hour window. The research doesn't reveal specific weather disasters, but this is England – pack for rain, hope for clouds, expect wind. At least you're 'never too remote from civilisation' when the weather turns. More weather exposure than Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Peak District elevations max around 600 meters, so altitude effects are non-existent.

Lower altitude than Gravel Worlds — no thin-air concerns."

That late-race 20km surprise descent into a hike-a-bike shows someone knows how to design suffering. A 13-year-old and her mum camping at Jacob's Ladder still finished in 36 hours proves the route has soul.
