The 32-hour cutoff and figure-eight design through Edale lets riders split it into manageable overnight segments or push through as a proper single-day challenge."

        "explanation": "Mid-May in the Peak District means you're gambling on British spring weather, which could be anything from snow to scorching sun within the same 32-hour window. The research doesn't reveal specific weather disasters, but this is England – pack for rain, hope for clouds, expect wind. At least you're 'never too remote from civilisation' when the weather turns."
      },
      "altitude": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Peak District elevations max around 600 meters, so altitude effects are non-existent. The route crosses gritstone edges and tors, but these are hills by mountain standards - your cardiovascular system won't notice the elevation."

      "adventure": {

        "explanation": "Laura \"bivvied in the wild for the first time\" and \"strayed off the map more than once,\" including \"five minutes of shouting 'hello?' into a patch of dense woodland.\" The unsupported format through Stanage and Curbar gritstone edges, combined with wild camping options, delivers proper bikepacking adventure despite the civilized setting."
      },

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "\"Now in its third edition\" puts this firmly in baby-event territory, with organizer Valerio Stuart positioning it as \"a stepping stone to bigger adventures.\" Laura's reflection that \"your first step doesn't have to be epic\" captures the event's intentionally modest ambitions - it's a training ground, not a destination race."
      },
      "race_quality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "No mass start format with riders leaving \"whenever they were ready\" creates a relaxed atmosphere but lacks competitive structure. The 32-hour cutoff accommodates weekend warriors, while fastest finishers completed routes in 11-13 hours on full-suspension mountain bikes, showing the time gaps reflect equipment choices more than racing depth."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Stanage and Curbar edges deliver Peak District grit, and the technical singletrack near the finish will separate the tourists from the riders. That late-race 20km surprise descent into a hike-a-bike shows someone knows how to design suffering. A 13-year-old and her mum camping at Jacob's Ladder still finished in 36 hours proves the route has soul."

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Event village camping in Bamford with post-ride pizza sounds cozy, but we're talking about a field so small they won't publish participation numbers. Claire Frecknall's endorsement about 'packing comfortable walking shoes' tells you this attracts more hikers than hammers. The 'larger than usual percentage of female participants' is promising, but hard to build legends with mystery attendance."

        "explanation": "Laura describes connecting with \"two fellow Peak Gravellers in Bakewell\" for an \"unexpected\" wild camp and shared final miles, showing the event delivers spontaneous adventure. The inclusive atmosphere where riders are welcomed \"whether zipping along for a speed demon time or taking it at a pace to savour the views\" maximizes the experience regardless of ability."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "They won't publish entry fees, which usually means they're either embarrassingly cheap or embarrassingly expensive. UK location means international travel costs, and Peak District accommodation gets pricey during tourist season. The included camping softens the blow, but you're still looking at European event pricing without European event prestige."
