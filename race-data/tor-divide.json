Mid-May in the Peak District means you're gambling on British spring weather, which could be anything from snow to scorching sun within the same 32-hour window. The research doesn't reveal specific weather disasters, but this is England – pack for rain, hope for clouds, expect wind. At least you're 'never too remote from civilisation' when the weather turns. More weather exposure than Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Peak District elevations max around 600 meters, so altitude effects are non-existent.

Lower altitude than Gravel Worlds — no thin-air concerns."

That late-race 20km surprise descent into a hike-a-bike shows someone knows how to design suffering. A 13-year-old and her mum camping at Jacob's Ladder still finished in 36 hours proves the route has soul.

          "transcript": "What's up? We are back, baby, and we're\ngeared up and we're ready for another\nshark adventure. This time we are\nheading off to the Peak District. Um,\nand we are taking part in the tour\ndivide, not to be mistaken with the US\nversion. I'm not fit enough um for that\nin the slightest. Um, maybe sometime in\nthe future, but for now, we're going to\ntake on the Tour Divide Peak Edition.\nUm, so 200k um, off-road uh, around the\nPeak District. Um, we have 32 hours to\ndo this. Uh, it's your choice if you\nwant to sleep or not. Um, you can go\nthrough the night. You can get the\nfastest time or you can ride it chill\nleisurely cafe stop kind of pace, which\nis what I'm going to go for. Um, but\nthis is the rig. She's ready to go. I'll\nsee you there.\njust got real. We entered\nthree different events, I think. So,\none's a gravel, one's like a mountain\nbike, and one's a bit of a mix really.\nUm, so we're racing the gravel, which is\n200k.\nUm, and we're going to do our own\nleisurely pace, I think. So, we're\nplanning to stop tonight around\nBakewell. Um, and then crack on rest of\nit tomorrow, and hopefully we're done.\nBut we're hoping the sun's going to come\nout cuz she's a bit chilly. Um, but this\nis a\nrig ready to go. Um, we just\ngot little backpack as well. So, there's\nlike some rules and regs of stuff that\nyou've got to take. So, we need to take\nis it 2 lers of water? 1.5. 1.5, which I\ncan't fit on that f frame cuz it's so\nsmall. So, we've got Douta um hydration\npack as well, which is absolutely rammed\nfull of snacks.\nSo yeah, we've signed on. We've got our\nnumber plates and we're going to head\noff. Should we do a tan off? Tan off.\nLook at that. That's good. You can tell\nwho stays in his workshop all the time.\nThat's true. You need to get some sun\ncream on them, pal.\nIs that true? Yeah, I reckon.\nOh, look at my nails. Match your eyes.\nIt's as if it was planned.\nThere we go. We're officially in. Then\nyou turn right again. You get to traffic\nlights. Then you turn right again. And\nthen hopefully by then he'll have just\nstay right. Let's go. You go through\nyour right turns and then then you go\nleft once from the main. It's a really\nshort loop if it's just right right.\nImagine. Yeah. 200k. 200k of right turn.\nSome idiots probably did it. You are on\nan island. You can't get lost. Yeah.\nThanks. If you hit the sea, come back.\nYou've gone too. Thank you. Enjoy it.\nI don't think we've even done a\nK. And we are straight up a big old\nhill. Can see\neveryone making their way up pushing\nbikes. She's a girl now, isn't he?\nYou got it.\nWell, that was the first of 38 climbs my\nwife who was saying, which was pretty\ngood timing. That was savage, wasn't it?\nThat was hard. Almost 38. Only 37 to go.\nNot many. That was straight off the bat\nas well. So, we literally What have we\neven distance we done? I reckon we've\ndone 5k. 5k and straight off the bat.\nJust up a hill, which was pretty savage.\nBut everyone's super friendly, which is\nnice. I got a cheer for ringing my bell.\nI did hear. Did you? I've not rang mine\nyet. Mine's a bit It feels a bit sketchy\nto ring it. Right, we got a nice descent\nnow, hopefully. Oh. Oh, steady now. I am\nprofessional mountain cyclist.\nWow. Just eating your dust.\nAre we going to have\na tash by the end of this ride?\n[Music]\nOh no.\nYou all right? You want to just cancel\nyour alarm or\nOh, your crash alarm's gone off.\nHang on.\nYou okay?\nShe's a hilly one. We just got to the\ntop of Winn's pass. I don't know if I'm\nsaying that right, but\num I'm safe to say I'm never going to\ncomplain about the state of our roads\nagain. That was a good road, wasn't it?\nOnly like 10 foot drops.\nYeah, extreme road. Um but yeah, it's\nvery nice so far. I think ignorance is\nbliss\nwith this route in a few crashes. Yeah.\nTooth missing. Oh, tooth missing. Found\nhis tooth. Bless him. Old chap.\nHopefully he cracks on and gets it done.\nUh what else we seeing? Lots of pushing\nand down. Up and down. Oh my god. Yeah,\npretty impressive really. But yeah, we\nmove to the top.\nGo in the\ncamera. All right.\nOh, gravel. Gravel's so\ngood. Fresh gravel.\n[Applause]\nNow, this is the gravel I signed up\nto. This is a bit less chunky.\nWe're shifting\nnow. We're about 40 km in.\nand it's about\n12:00 and our aim is to\ndo 120 today and at the\nmoment we're not going to get there till\ndark. So just getting a bit of a shift\non have some lunch and\nthen have lunch about halfway is our\nthinking and then crack\non. Watch out for the monsters.\nFood time. Food time.\nOne of\ntea. I'm very excited. You're not going\nto move after that door stop.\nSo, we're currently on the Monsole trail\nand all the way down. How far? Uh we are\nabout\n54 54k in. I think it's like 55 54\nsomething like that. 54k in. Just\nstopped for a brew and lost the drum.\nOh my god. Do you spray yourself with\napple juice? The GoPro probably got it.\nUm so we're just refueling. But I think\nthat was probably one of the hardest\n50ks I think I've ever done. Mhm. The um\norganizers said that you need they\nrecommended 40 mil tires and I would\ndefinitely go as big as you can possibly\ngo to be honest cuz that was some chunky\ngravel. Um so I've got 47. So what did\nyou put on in the end? They're 45s\napparently but they look much skinnier.\nYeah, I think they are 45. Yeah, if\nyou're if you're into comfort, I'd go\nwider the better basically. Uh, but this\nmonster trail is nice. It's actually\nchampagne gravel as we like to call it.\nUm, so we picked up some speed now and\nwe've actually covered some good ground,\nbut we're hoping to get to Bakewell.\nSo, we've got another 70k to go.\nE. Um, so hopefully it stays this lovely\nchampagne gravel. Um, yeah, the sun's\ncome out\nand Oh, yeah.\nM. We'll see you in a bit.\nIt is\npretty.\nSo the champagne\ngravel soon run out.\nSoonly soon run out.\nIt doesn't even look that bad, but it\nis. It's that dry and loose. There's\njust no traction.\nUm, and it's really\nhard at the top.\nGet smile. You're having fun. That's so\nmuch fun. I love going uphill and\nhiking. Hey, little one.\nThat's a nice view. Nice view. Still\ngoing on that pastel. Thank you. Still\nso much heat. 15 minutes later. Yeah.\nWell, the sun's gone from zero to\n100 in about an hour.\nYeah, it's absolutely melting.\nUm, but amazing\nview. God knows where we're at.\nUp. That's all we've been doing all day.\nFeel like we're almost at the\nsun. Not enough. Not enough.\nBut how far in are we?\nWe are 73. 45 miles in.\nDoing all right.\nSo 50k left.\n50k left. That was quick math. My\nbrain's not functioning that well. Um\nyeah, 50k\nleft. Make the feeling strong.\nSafe town.\nHow's the time coming? I think it's\nnon-existent. I think it's just dust.\nJust dirt. Yeah. It wouldn't be a trip\nto Bquel without BQ now, would it? Aston\nwasn't a fan. Not a fan. Not a fan.\nSorry, everyone. It's one of my faves,\nactually. Hey,\nwhat's\nup? You looking at Huh? Look at the glow\non him. Working shine, isn't he?\nWorking. Oh, look. She's after him. Go\non, love. Get yourself laid.\nI think this is a little pickme up we\nneeded. So\nnice.\nOh,\nlovely. Having a wonderful\ntime. Lovely way to end the\nday. Nice hiker\nbike. Oh man. Be good descent on a\nmountain bike.\nDon't know about anyone else, but when\nyou're doing this kind of stuff or like\ngoing for\nhikes, I always like to pick which\nline I'd come down on a mountain bike.\nMe and dad always do it when we go for\nhikes. Just makes it a bit more\ninteresting in a mountain biker and me,\nI\nguess. But yeah, she is hot. The wind\nhas disappeared and it is it is tea\ntime and it's\nstarving. Lie buddies.\nTell me you're broken without telling me\nyou're broken.\nOh man, we just raided Co-op, but\nCo-op's had a strike or something, so\nthere's nothing in there. And we've\nmanaged to find the only pizza place\nthat hasn't sold our pizza. We basically\nhad to fight two guys for the last\npizza. And my pizza has got one\npineapple chunk per slice.\nNot happy. Not happy. You've got three.\nI got not even one per slice. No, I've\ngot three and a half. Three and a half.\nI got a nice view.\nWe made it.\nI've had a wash. Well done. You look\nclean and fresh. I feel so nice. I I\nfeel like I feel so crusty. It's unreal.\nSo, I'm looking forward to a tap wash.\nIs that what we've got? A tap wash. Can\nyou believe you have to pay £15 for a\ncampsite and all you get is a toilet?\nWas it 15 quid? Uh 12 quid. 12 quid.\nThey didn't even have a toilet though.\nAbsolute riper. They didn't let us on\nbecause we didn't have a toilet with us.\nNo. Oh, the other one. Yeah, that's\nthat's a that's another story for\nanother day. So, this is bed. We're set\nup. The sun is setting and we've got\nloads more fellow tour dividers with us\nas well, which is pretty cool. Looks\nnice and flat. So, yeah. I just hope you\ndon't snore. Yeah, you don't snore, do\nyou? Does anyone snore?\nDid I snore yesterday? I'll probably\nshuffle. Shuffle? She's the queen of\nshuffling. I'm pretty good at\nshuffling there.\nGood morning. It is 7 a.m. of day two.\nWe've just got into Baslo, but a dirty\nCosta and a breakfast in a\npot. Didn't always rely on co-op to be\nopen on a Sunday morning. Um, so we've\ngot about 80k to do today.\nMy ass is feeling it from me\ntoday. I think normally I don't suffer\nwith a sore roof, but um I think the\namount of off-road\nand really really rough um tracks has\ntaken its toll. Um so yeah, be\ninteresting to see. Now I get Now I know\nhow you feel all the\ntime and it's not very nice. Um so yeah,\nwe're going to crack on. Hopefully the\nsun comes out cuz it's absolutely\nBaltic. I've got full full wind to\nretire on. I've literally got every\nlayer. I almost didn't bring trousers\nand I'm so grateful Aston made me bring\nthem. So um yeah, wish us\nluck. Oh.\nWelcome to the Welcome to the tour\ndivide everyone.\nmore graceful.\nI break a little stuck in the head.\nAll you've seen so far is the lovely\ndownhill sections, but this is reality.\nWoo! Lady Bower should have brought the\nmountain bikes, mate. Something comfier.\nYou still got that mud on your I'm\nsaving it for later. I think it's just\npart of your skin.\nHow far are we\nin? Wait. Ah,\n36k. 23\nmile. Got a long way to go. We start off\nwith 80.\nBit less than 80.\n50 then\n50ish. I'm giving up counting now. Let's\nsay 45. That's not too bad. 45 45k to\ngo.\nIt's been rough on the old roof.\nHow you feeling?\nEverything hurts.\nBig old resy.\nSo, we get to the end of this reservoir\nand turn back around and go back all the\nother\nside. I find this riding quite boring.\nYeah. But it's been a nice change from\nthe\num rough off road. So, we'll take it\nbecause it's bound to change\nsoon. But yeah, we're not far now. We're\ngoing to bong through the pain. You can\ndo it. You're strong independent wood.\nStrong independent wood.\nFirst mechanical.\nHopefully the last. Hopefully the last\none. We're not far now.\nSo doing a grand job there.\nStaying up.\nI'll take them out. We're almost there.\nWe're\ngetting covered in dirt.\nThere we go. Fashed it.\n200k done.\nIt's been epic. All right. Well done.\nNot done. Would you do it again?\nMaybe with a bike that has\nsuspension. That might be nice. Yeah,\nmaybe one of those um Thud\nBusters. Remember them? Like suspension\nsaddle. Oh, how nice would that be? And\nsuspension handlebars. Yeah, maybe we\nshould just get full sus. But yeah,\nwe're having the celebratory pizza on\nthe house of Tour Divide. So, thank you\nvery much.

          "description": "Hi all,\n\nI’ve recently come back from a wet bikepacking weekend hosted by Tor Divide guys. The ride started in Manchester City Centre heading out to a campsite in the beautiful Peak District that was booked by the organisers on the Saturday night, returning on the Sunday for beer and medals. What else could you ask for on this Peak Gravel Overnighter?\n\nTypically, the weather was not kind to us from about 10am Saturday morning - the rain started and would stay with us untill about 3am Sunday morning. Despite this, we managed to keep our spirits high and have a laugh all the same.\n\nWe were going to sit around the campfire and tell stories of past trips and enjoy the evening under the stars. This quickly changed into a session at the pub, eating and drinking until we had dried out.\n\nOur return route took in my favourite road in the Peak (because it’s closed) - Mam Tor, a famous road that is being reclaimed by nature as her own. \n\nSunshine and skids were the theme of the Sunday's return route of the Peak Gravel Overnighter; we packed up our wet (and broken) tents and cycled back via a cafe stop or two. The finish line was Balance Brewery - a company that wasn’t scared to experiment with British ingredients through modern interpretations.\n\nAll of this on just a back brake - the front just disappeared on the morning of day one. \n\nBig thanks to the Tor Divide guys for getting us there and back safely with a lot of good banter in between. \n\nIt was amazing to meet so many new like-minded people and make some new friends, that’s what this is all about!\n\n🍕 If you enjoyed this film, you can show your support in pizza form by this link  https://buymeacoffee.com/allenboardman 🍕 \n\nThough I'd love it if you just tuned in from time to time 🤟🏻 \n\nSee you out there! \n\n-Allen\n\nProudly supported by Acepac Bikepacking Bags https://www.acepac.bike/en/\n\n0:00 Start\n1:00 Where am I?\n2:04 so much rain \n4:02 Bus stop shelter \n5:14 Pub for tea \n6:43 Good morning!\n7:36 Mam Tor\n10:54 NCN back to the start.",

Start in Manchester goes to the\nPeak District. Got a table booked at a\npub.\nCampsite booked as well. So throw the\ntent up and try not to get too wet.\nHow's it going?\n&gt;&gt; Good.\n&gt;&gt; That was thumbs up.\n&gt;&gt; Double thumbs up.\nYep.\nHoly moly.\nWoo!\nAt\nleast it's been consistent. Light rain\nsince the start almost or at least rain\nsince the cafe.\nOnly got about 3.7k\nuntil we reach camp which is quite nice.\nI have no idea what time it is cuz can't\nsee the time on my computer, but must be\naround about 400 p.m. something like\nthat. I'm looking forward to to\nnot riding in this weather anymore.\nYou may have noticed I'm not on my usual\nbike. That's because she needs some\nmoney spending on her. Need new\ncassette, new chain, new chain ring, new\nbottom bracket,\nuh new bearings in the rear wheel.\nfork service. Yeah, this is a gravel\nroute. I'm on a gravel bike, which makes\nsense, but\nalways prefer a hard tail.\nAll I wanted was 5 minutes not being\nrained on. I stopped at a bus stop, had\na bite to eat, and looked at our map. I\nwanted to see how close this campsite\nactually was.\nI've made it. I've made it to camp.\nThere's horses.\nHey guys.\nWith the tent up, the only option left\nwas to sit in it and wait out until the\nmorning. Rain, rain, and more rain. I\nthen got a text message as my friends\ntelling me, \"Come to the pub. We've got\nbeer. We got real food. Don't be sitting\nin your tent all night. Come and join\nus.\" Before I knew it, I had my coat on\nand my wet shorts on again. And I was\nbattling through the wind and the rain.\n&gt;&gt; Where did you come from?\n&gt;&gt; It was so worth it.\nWhen discussing ultimist strategy,\n&gt;&gt; how many hours of sleep is the what they\ndid the ultimate?\n&gt;&gt; Three hours. 2 hours.\n&gt;&gt; You got 2 hours.\n&gt;&gt; 14 minutes.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, he's on spot. Very good.\n&gt;&gt; To go with a bottle.\n&gt;&gt; This is for a 50.\n&gt;&gt; 16th of May.\n&gt;&gt; And 17. Cool. Is that good?\n&gt;&gt; I don't even know. very good.\n&gt;&gt; Welcome.\n&gt;&gt; Insider information.\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n&gt;&gt; Post pub faf.\n&gt;&gt; Some of us have had seven points. Some\nof us have had a couple and I've only\nhad two actually and a whiskey. Just a\ndouble whiskey. And it's windy and it's\nnot raining too much for now.\nBy the way, Gary here, the lovely.\n&gt;&gt; It's cold.\nIt's really cold.\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, sir.\n&gt;&gt; A\n&gt;&gt; love you.\n&gt;&gt; Pay the toll fee. Pay the toll.\n&gt;&gt; Love you.\n&gt;&gt; Hey, horsey.\nWe're going to make a couple tiny\nchanges to the route going back. So,\nwe're going to miss Lord's seat. The\nreality is it's going to be is always is\noften boggy and after yesterday is going\nto be a bit of a push. stop being\nMarble. Like I said, you know, it's a\nyou you're free to stop whenever\ncrunchy.\nThank you. No worries.\nWoo. It's a bit close.\nThere were No.\nAs you can see, the sun's out. How good\nis that? Look at the views as well. I\ncan actually see more than a couple of\nmeters in front of me. Yeah, there's a\nsmile on my face today, isn't there?\nLast night's uh camp was a bit wild.\nTent broke again. So, probably the fifth\nnight in it overall and it's broken\ntwice.\nWhoa.\nSo, the top bar that goes across to just\nholds out the edges snapped\nagain. It was meant to be a nice little\ntreat for myself. paid big big dollars\nfor it. Literally got import tax on it\nas well. Yay.\nAnd it's not been as\nreliable as my six moon lunar solo that\nI've done about 6 years in.\nHeading all the way back to Manchester\nnow. We got a little village that we're\ngoing to which I don't know the name of\nbut I'm following the line until it gets\nme to probably a nice bacon buty. You\nshould know me by now. Powered by bacon\nor sausage buties or bacon and sausage\nbuties. Still very much a hard tail\nrider. Gravel bikes aren't aren't for\nme. Not really sure if this is a good\nidea going this quick cuz I won't be\nable to stop.\nTry the brakes. Nothing.\n&gt;&gt; You ordered my sandwich. What?\n&gt;&gt; They ran out.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's it. You finished.\nThat's right.\nWell done. Well done.\n&gt;&gt; Thank you so much for looking after us.\n&gt;&gt; Oh, no. Pleasure.\n&gt;&gt; Great time. It's wonderful.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nThat's it. It's a wrap. Successful trip.\nWe had weather, we had beer, we had lots\nof fun,\nand now it's home time.

Oh,\nthe actual ride I'm doing is called Peak\nGravel. It's it's nearly 200 km um off\nroad around the Peak District. My plan\nfor this event is just to go around as\nquickly as I can. There's a mandatory\nkit for the route. So, I'm taking the\nabsolute bare minimum. And the idea is\njust to try and get back here before\n11:00 Saturday evening. It starts at\n8:00, so I've got 15 hours to do 200k.\nWe've got coffee stand setting up. We've\ngot some clothing staying up. They'll be\nready in the morning. And on the end\nhere in the marquee in the end, there's\nsome uh street food, some Thai street\nfood. So, I've decided to go for the\ncheapkate option. Show you what I'm\nmaking. So, I've got some uh sausage\nfrom little pasta sauce. And of course,\nalong with all that good stuff,\nYou can see in there\npasta. I've gone and splashed out on a\nking goblin and pale ruby bear\n8.8%. This is the morning of the tour\ndivide. All right. Looking forward to\nit. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Good. Yeah.\nGood. Big gravel route. Is it? Uh, no at\nall. Oh, somebody actually is not doing\nthe smallest route. Everybody last night\nwas doing all the the big gravel route.\nSo, I was like, I'm with Valyrio. How\nyou doing? Not too bad. Not too bad.\nNervous. Excited. Is the criter of the\nto divide? Uh, guilty. So, what have I\ngot? So, you're looking forward 200k,\n4,000 m of climbing, which is about 12\nuh,000 ft. So, a lot of climbing, but a\nlot of beautiful roads, uh, a lot of\nbeautiful gravel trails. Some people\nwill not stop. Some people will rough it\nout, sleep in a ditch somewhere. Some\npeople will get a fivestar B&amp;B. It's\nunsupported. So, as long as you don't\nrearrange it and you don't sleep in some\nmate's house, anything else is fair\ngame.\nYou'll find plenty of walkers, horse\nriders, motor bikers, uh just, you know,\nshare the space.\n[Music]\nSo, we just got up to highest point.\nRadio mass or something. Some great\nviews and things as we're heading next\nover to the Hope Valley. Plan is we're\ntaking the broken road. So, definitely\nhike a bike through there.\nAnd then straight up\nmamour. So we just come down from there.\nIt was a great descent. I just had to\nwalk a few bits. So I wasn't fully\nconfident. Very rocky. I can see a good\nline but wasn't confident enough to ride\nit. The broken road 6.6. 6 km away.\nWe're back onto the road heading towards\na shop at 3.1\nkm. 30k in. I've kind of worked out\nroughly done 20% of the climbing\nalready. Nearly 900\nmeters. So I've just spotted an\nindividual touch and that\nis they can't see mine too well. They've\nall got names. So this guy is called\nGreg. Craig. I'm going to pretend I know\nhim so I can see he's\non top. How you doing Craig? I'm right.\nHow are you? Yeah. Very good, thank you.\nDo you know who how I know your name?\nNo, because it's written on the front of\nmy bike. It is. I just discovered it.\nI'm like, well, it's got mine on it,\nRichard. All right. How you doing, man?\nYeah. Very good. How you finding the\nride so far? 30K in. Enjoying it. Yeah.\nTaking it nice and easy. Trying not to\ngo too hard. Done quite a sizable amount\nof the climbing already. Yeah. There's\nquite I mean I guess the bit out of\nStony Middleton is a bit unpleasant.\nThen after that, there's quite a lot of\nflat sort of M trail, Tisson Trail, that\nkind of thing. There are some pretty\nchunky hills coming in our direction.\nNow I'm on this railway track. The\ncamera I'll talk to you again. me think\nabout what I have packed in my flat in\nmy tail fin and I can't remember packing\nthe helmet light this evening. Hopefully\nI did get you down with the sound of the\nold school vibe. Keep it alive with my\nsurvive. Everybody know we going to do\nit like this. Come on everybody don't\nstop, don't\nquit. Everybody feel it. Come around\nwith\nthe sound. Everybody get down when we\ngive it to\nyou. Everybody feel it. Come around with\ngive it to you.\nYeah. Come on. We get you down with the\nsound of the old school vibe. Keep it\nalive with my tribe. Survive. Everybody\nknow we going to do it like this. Come\non everybody, don't stop it. Come\non, everybody. Feel it. Come around with\ndown\nthere. Throw a bit down there. Cargo\nbike number\none. I don't know whether I'm going to\ncount cargo bikes today, but cuz there\nmight be so many I I'll lose count. If\nyou don't know the bons, as you can see,\nthere's just lots of families on here.\nSo, it's all very easy\ngoing. Here comes the\nsun. And as quick as that, it's gone\nagain.\nCertainly one of the more memorable\nparts of the tour divide. You're going\nto see when you sign up next year, 2026.\nSo, it's getting hot now. Just enjoying\nanother trail on the way to Chrome View.\nPromise you this time it's not as steep\nas it looks on camera. It's the top of\nuh well I think it's top of the\nfive course it says it is.\nSo certain feel with it.\nThere's a beautiful gravel track this\none. This is what all gravel tracks in\nthe UK should be like. Oh, they called I\ncall this Gucci gravel. Look at this.\nAnd it's got a nice bit of\nwoodland dead grass thing running\nthrough the middle as\nwell. Perfect. Cuz it's nice cush nicely\ncushioned. So come up to what Vario\nthat's organized the event called the\ndragon back here. And I knew exactly\nwhat I meant. It's over that way\nsomewhere. I know I know this to be true\ncuz there's like a stock car racing\nthing\nthere. Now, I don't really know how well\nthis comes on camera, but it's referring\nto this hill over there. Uh I've seen it\non all different angles, and it's the\nscales of a dragon's back. You can see\nloads of people up there right now. And\nsomebody up on top of that one there,\nbut that one, it's just it's got loads\nof character on it. It's like beautiful.\nThere's people walking around everywhere\ndown there.\nIt's a beautiful day. The sun is out.\nI'm not Don't worry, I'm not going to\nsing again. You're all\nright. Heat. Heat.\nTell you what, some options for uh\nputting a tent up around here. Just on\nthe river bank there, you got fresh\nwater. You got a filter.\nLet's have a look this along the boat.\nNot honesty shop get through.\nSo we've got some Dalton's ice cream\nprices on the wall. Some drinks. Oh,\nsome lovely cakes. Carrot cakes. Oh wow.\nThis is literally on route. We've also\ngot some chams and chutney and things\nlike that. You won't want those. I think\nI'm going to indulge in awesome sausage\nrolls as well. Look at\nthis. 260. Oh, and a carrot cake. Just\ncame at the perfect time. Starting to\nreally feel\nhungry. Heat up\nhere.\nAnother walk and turning right head\ntowards Ashborne. Go down there. Not all\nthe way to Ashboard, but a bit of a\ndownhill look coming\nup. And as you can see, the sky is\ngorgeous now. There's not a cloud in the\nsky at all at all at all. As we edge 20\n3K done at the pace that I've got this\nfar, you know, I could well be past\nmidnight now by the time I finish.\nYeah. So that's it. We come off the\nTissan Trail into the village of\nTissan. And uh I shouldn't know what's\ncoming up cuz there's not that many ways\nto go. There's actually riding down\nhere. So there's a lovely descent. This\nkind of little meadow area and there's\nlike a ford at the very bottom. A little\nbit of suffering going on at the moment.\nThe bike seems to be holded up. Uh just\ngone up on a hill.\nJust be losing a bit of energy. So just\nuh had a bit wedge of that. We'll have\nanother bit in a minute. Uh just stop\nfor a second. I also wanted to show you\nover there. I don't probably don't come\nup in the camera, but I'm just the other\nside of the vioaduct on the Monsole\ntrail. If you know, you know. And this\nis it from the road down below. You can\nsee the access road to the farm runs\nthrough. You can't go up there. There's\nit's gated off. But yeah, interesting\nall the same. Well, interesting for me.\nI'm not sure if you find interesting,\nbut I like to see the world from\ndifferent perspectives. And you know,\nI've been across that valley on the\nMontal Trail. Sorry, High Peak Trail.\nSorry, I don't get confused. High peak\ntrail many many times and that's the\nvioaduct over there and uh yeah off the\ntrail looking across it and uh the\neffort the cost that must have gone into\nuh to building that just you know to\nretain access for a farmer.\nNo heat.\nto uh quote another song. I won't sing\nit, but Oh, it's like gold\ndust. Look,\nco-op.\nYes. Oh, it's not going to be a co-wre\nzone. They're\neverywhere. So, whilst I'm clearly\nwalking again, I thought I'd turn the\ncamera on to give you a bit of an\nupdate.\n7:00 1 minute to 7 about 65k to go. Just\nleft Bayow. Somebody said early on that\nis is the last chance for resupply. So\nI've got two full water bottles 150 ml\nand I've got a small little 500ml one\nwith some uh circuit carb mix. So I'm\nwell liquided up. been uh chasing liquid\nketchup and dehydration since uh bake\nwhile in the uh tail fin. I've got\nuh some sandwiches and what else did I\nbuy? Got a yogurt in the top two bag. So\nthat's kind of an addition addition to\nwhat I've already got. Like I've got\nsome pepperoni pepper armies and\nuh few uh silver bows and more of\nyou. Right, let's just have a quick look\nback, shall we? Cuz tell you what, this\nconservation area\nhere wherever I am. Let's put back\ndown. Look at that. Look at that for a\ntent\nspot. Wow.\nSo to try and remember this, put on the\nto-do list cuz that is\nepic.\nWow. Beautiful. Looks lovely and flat. I\nmust just add if I put a tent up there,\nthere's a beautiful view of Chzsworth\nHouse right in the middle so I can look\ndown on the uh common folk down there.\nYeah, I thought it was this climb. I\nremember coming down here last time.\nYeah, you go\nalong something Basau. Yeah. edge or\nsomething, don't you? I don't know.\nThere's Bford Edge, isn't there?\nSomewhere around here. Could well be\nthat H.\nNow I managed to steer and film at the\nsame\ntime. It's pretty gnarly up here. But\nanyway, let's get on with it. Yeah. So,\ninto the last couple of hours. I'm\ntrying to film much as I can for you\nguys watching, especially if you're\nfancy doing the tour divide at some\npoint. So, again, this is the peak\ngravel\nroute. Pretty pretty stunning. It's\npretty challenging at times as well. It\nused to be challenging. Otherwise, you\njust kind of just miss it, wouldn't you?\nMaybe not do it\nagain. But it's\nlovely. I think we're top of fog now.\nNot too sure where I\nam. I think that's probably the first\ntime I've said it. This\nvideo Heat. Heat. N.\nSo, my original goal was to try and get\nto the end before 11:00 for pizza and\nbeer, but uh it's going to have to be\npizza and beer for breakfast now, I\nthink. So, we're\njust past Barrook. There was a body of\nwater at the top where there's people\nover water swimming, I guess. Yeah, even\nthough it's not exactly that warm, just\npeople in there bathing. Always wanted\nto ride this bit around Harvis and\nBamford and uh\nFrogett. Feels like on the top of the\nworld at the moment. Crossed over the\nmain road between\nSheffield and\nHarvis. And yeah, Sheffield off in the\ndistance there. And this beauty right\nhere. I think pretty much the highest\npoint in the ride or close very close to\nas we head towards Stanage next.\nCurrently going along Hound Kirk Road.\nYeah, lots of\npotholes amazing views over the side\nthere towards Sheffield and Ram and\nbeyond. Heat. Heat.\nSo, we're heading to our stage pole now.\nLess than 3 miles away. Sun just dipping\nbelow the hill there. Let's head towards\n9:00. Look, not a\ncloud. Beautiful\nday. Bye-bye,\nsunshine. See you tomorrow. Okay, my\nleft leg's niggling a little bit, but\nsurprisingly fresh still. I've fueled\nwell. Um, early on. Didn't drink enough,\nbut I've caught back on that now. I got\nplenty of liquids. I need to stop for\nsomewhere to eat as well. Um, probably\ngoing to stop near the dam somewhere in\nthe dark and just eat my sandwich, I\nthink.\nAnd uh maybe I stuck a peer army in\npepper army in my gob. I'll make it to\ngo to get to the slippery stones bridge\nor whatever it's called and stop there\nand have my uh my wraps. Yeah, that's a\ngood idea. That's a good goal, would\nit? I'm looking forward to riding in the\ndarkness. Um I often shied away from it\nin the last couple years, but I do love\nit. I do love it once you've got over\nthat initial oh my god. Here we go. An\nempty red\nm. Oh yeah. Wish I had my feet\nup. Forgot what I was going to say\nnow. Don't know. But yeah, be off your\nviews. By the time I get down the other\nside, it'll be uh dark, I think. When I\nget down there as well,\nbecause it's quite a rocky\ndescent. So, bit of a course update. I\nstarted the ride at\n53%. I nearly towards the end of this\none and I'm down to\n42. Public arts here. down to 42. It\nkind of speaks for itself. The battery\nlife is its number one\nsuperpower. You know, if you're on the\nroad, you can probably clear 1,000 km\nand still have life left in a single\ncharge.\nThat's it. I've reached Stanley's Pole,\nwhich I've mentioned several times in\nthis video cuz it's kind of a a\nlandmark. Kind of the first time I went\nout on the mountain bike in the P\ndistrict was here. And wow, the views\nare stunning. If I just get out the\npicture, I mean, look at the\nskyline. Wow, it's about half 9 now. I\ncannot state enough how much I love the\nlong days.\ntime of recording, we're about a month\naway, just over a month away from the\nlongest day. And uh it's glorious, isn't\nit? I'm going to cover up, get down the\nother side. I've had my celebration now\nreaching the top, you I've had my\ncustomary celebration.\nAnd that if you hopefully wasn't too\nwobbly was this descent down stanage\nedge. It's a it's definitely more\nenjoyable on the mountain bike. Bit\nsketch on the gravel bike. Definitely\nwould have gone faster.\nSo, I'm heading alongside the dam over\nthere. Can't see anything at the\nmoment. So, I'm going to have a bit of a\npicnic when I get to the bottom with a\nbridge or whatever. There's a bench down\nthere.\nUh some food. Yes, food. A bit of drink.\nAnd uh I'm going to pop your photo on me\ninsulated jacket at that point\nafter take me arm warmers off and put\nthem over my\nlegs. What do you mean? Put your arm\nwarmers over the legs. It's exactly\nthat. Depends how thick your legs are,\nwhether it work for you. But my legs are\npretty massive. Got massive calves. I\nknow he's managed to squeeze them on\nsomehow. I think that's somebody over\nthere because the road closed on that\ntime. It's only the\nrangers. It's coming up to half 10. So,\neverybody around here will miss the uh\nbeer and pizza for tonight.\nWhat a beautiful evening. I mean, look\nat our\nsky.\nFantastic. It's a little bit\nchilly. Definitely noticeable on the\ndescents, but there's not really many of\nthose now, to be\nhonest. That's it. I've reached the uh\nslippery stones. Time to\ncelebrate. Now, a couple\nwraps. It's not that\ncold. Might not need to put jacket on\njust\nyet. The stars are\nout. A little sliver of blue on the\nhorizon at 11:00 at night.\nThere's the odd light twinkling away in\nthe distance over towards what's called\nthe dark peak which if you do the full\ntour\ndivide over there on a mountain bike and\nit's pretty pretty\nterrible. Well, I would consider it\nterrible. That's why I did the peak\ngravel route. And what's left, you know,\ncoming towards the end of the ride. Got\na couple\nflapjacks. Uh got a Kendall mint bar.\nBrought three of those with me. So I'm\ngrab the last one as well. Well folks,\nthat's very done and dusted. I'm keeping\nmy voice down cuz there's bound to be\npeople here sleeping in tents and\nthings. So just let you know what time I\nfinished. Uh quart 1 in the morning.\nSo yeah, not too far past what I\nexpected it to take. Uh did I enjoy it?\nYes, I did. Um there was the bits some\nbits I didn't like. Yes, there was\nalways something you don't like. Um will\nI do it again? Quite possibly. Maybe one\nof the other routes. Uh yeah, very good.\nVery good. I shall see you in the\nmorning anyway. I uh but right now I'm\ngoing to have a\nshower. It's the morning after the tour\ndivide. Uh you might be tell by the\ncroaky voice actually. So, I'm just uh\nhaving a tour of the of the car park, I\nguess, in the campsite base. There's a\nlot of people back already. It's\nuh about 9:00 in the\nmorning. Oh, look over there. There's\nsome more coffee and breakfast stuff.\nDidn't realize that. I'm going to head\nover there, I think. Did I have a good\ntime? Yes, I did. Would I recommend it?\nYes, I would. It's a big challenge. Took\nme 17 hours and 15 minutes. There was\nlots of descents towards the end and I I\njust covered up that. I was all dressed\nwith about 10 minutes just spitting\neverything I had with me on for the\nfinal descent which was unnecessary cuz\nit was much of a descent. It was those\nlike rooty woodlands and everything and\nit just took ages. Oh, appears to be\nanother vent going on that explains the\nlack of luggage I\nguess. Oh well, I just need one of their\nchoco pans. So, thank you very much.\nWell done. He's in one piece. He\nsurvived. We got video evidence of that.\nSo, it was a fantastic. I really, really\nenjoyed it. I got back at uh quart 1 in\nthe morning. So, good. I worked it out\n17 hours and 15 minutes. Good effort.\nAnd I love the uh little finish through\nBlack Le Haywards, I think it was\ncalled. That was nice and rooty. And uh\nyeah, I was I was I had it in my head\nlike, \"Oh, it's all downhill.\" I got\ndressed up and everything. Cover them. I\nput my arm warmers on me legs to create\nleg warmers. Put everything else on and\nI was nice and warm and cozy for the\ndescent which didn't really happen.\nLasted for a little bit, but not not\nlong. Yeah. Still no like they say, you\nknow, every you have to earn all the\nmiles really. Um there's no there are\neasier sections, but especially when he\ngets to the end, it's still you still\nhave to work to get to get back. And I\nsaid off camera to you, you know, it's\num when you do these things, you want\npeople to leave with a memory for\ntelling the friends and, you know,\nrecommending it and uh you know, signing\nup for the following year. So, you need\nto give them something. So, when you\nlike piss people off a little bit, but\nnot too much, but not too much. Yeah.\nmemorable memorable bit which as people\ncall it the type two kind of fun which\nperhaps is not necessarily fun as you do\nit but you look at it the next day you\nthink like that was hard next year I\nmight be more prepared or next year I'll\njust look at it thinking yeah I've done\nthat and I'll do it I\nsurvived and I tell you what I when I\ngot to the end as well it was it made\nthe shower even more pleasing oh I don't\nwant to I don't want to get out of this\nshowering.\nIt was it got really cold last night.\nSo, well done. When I got done when I\ngot towards the end, I didn't have me uh\nI didn't have a spare jersey and I\nalways get a really cold back and it was\nsweaty. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And when\nyou've got a sweaty back, you it's\nreally hard to warm up in that moment.\nThat's it. Yeah. It's really get damp.\nAnyway, why why the Peak District? Why\nis it crazy? Yeah. So, Peak District is\nwhere I do most of my riding. So, it's\nkind of the place where I like to ride.\nUh, I love the Peak District. I love\nriding here. There's so much variety, I\nfind. Um, and it just, yeah, I was\nlooking for a backpacking event that was\nfriendly enough for people doing it for\nthe first time, but also challenging\nenough so that, you know, it kind of\nprepares you to for bigger adventures.\nYou don't sound like you're originally\nfrom the P. No, no, not at all. So, I'm\nI'm I'm Italian. I live in Manchester.\nUh, I've been living in Manchester for\nabout 10 years. Um, and funny enough, I\nI had no interest in cycling back in\nItaly. Uh, I just started riding like\nmany people after the pandemic. Tuskany\nTrail was my the first bike backing\nevent. I'm going to Tuskin in June.\nBrilliant. Brilliant. July only. That's\nactually where I'm from. Uh, and I Yeah,\nTuskin Trail was the first event and I\nthought, wow, this is, you know, this is\nit was a bit of an eye open straight\naway. Yeah. Got got in love with it. I\nthought let's let's try to do something\nlike that in the peak and and that's how\nto came about. Yeah. Yeah. Well, thank\nyou very much. Thank you. There we are.\nI'll give you a hand shake. There we go.\nThank you very much. Really enjoyed you\nfinally from this side of the the\nscreen. Yeah, that's it. Yeah. Thanks\nfor coming. Yeah.

So for Tour Divide, we've got a\nspecific Tour Divide collection and then\nwe really just try and show a couple of\nour technical pieces because as I said\nthe range is massive. Um so it's always\ngood to see it. But from a tactile\ntouching point of view, these events are\nso important for us, you know. Yeah, I'm\nsure Valero is, you know, pleased to\nhave you here. Yeah, it's been a great I\nmust say Valero and his setup and just\nhis team. I said it on one of my posts\nabout vibe. It's got such a good vibe\nabout it. I think people, you talk to\nthe people doing the ride, they walk\naway from this having an experience and\nI think that's what this is. Such an\neclectic mix of individual. What did you\nthink to the uh end of the end of the\nride there? It was just just really\nreally hard and I'd got a dynamo and I'd\nnot taken a backup light. So, as soon as\nI slowed down, the light dimmed. Those\nsketchy bits where the roots are all\ncoming down the side of the Yeah, it was\nbeautiful. But at the time, I didn't\nwant to crash cuz I was so so tired. You\ngot back at 10 2 in the morning, you\njust told me. Yeah. And I I I thought I\nwas like hallucinating. It was weird. So\nmy light shines a beam really close to\nthe floor. Yeah. And then it\nshines a general beam and a distant\nbeam. There's these two little dead\nspots. And it was kind of like, oh,\nsomething wrong with my eye. My eye is\nnot working. I've got like a blind bit\nin my eye. It It wasn't one of those\nmillion flies that you squatted away all\nday long. No, it was good. It was good.\nUm I loved I actually loved most of that\nride. There was certain bit that we did\nover the the top of the when the sun was\ngoing down. That was just Yeah, that\nStanage pole that was amazing that I was\nlooking forward to getting up there and\nNo, good event. Good event. Yeah, good.\nGlad you enjoyed it. Cheers. ridden\naround here before, but to be fair, I\ndidn't get as far as I thought I would\nyesterday. So\nthen it just meant I rode till sort of\n2:00 in the morning. Well, no, 1:30.\nYeah.

I had planned to do this over 2 days but due to Joe dropping out to go hiking instead, it meant I was in a better position to smash the ride out in a single day and not take a fully loaded bike out on the route.\n\nThe Tor Divide is a non-competitive, self-supported bikepacking adventure that challenges riders to tackle trails, bridleways, and scenic roads on a fixed route. \n\nWhether you're a seasoned explorer or new to the world of bikepacking, this event offers three route options to suit your style. No prizes—just the thrill of the ride, the freedom of the open trail, and the glory of finishing on your own terms.\n\nOfficial website: https://tordivide.co.uk/\n\n📲Connect with me!\n\nInstagram https://www.instagram.com/the_yorkshire_wheeler/\n\nYouTube https://www.youtube.com/@theyorkshirewheeler  \n\nMake sure you change the Quality to 4k for the best viewing experience.\n\n👍Please support the channel by subscribing, leaving a like and commenting.\n\n00:00 Tor Divide start\n2:43 Mam Tor Broken Road\n3:23 Tor Divide\n11:45 Wild Camp Bike Setup\n\n-----------------------------------------------------\nMusic Credit:\nMusic by Mark Generous - Early Mornings - https://thmatc.co/?l=9F28971D\n-----------------------------------------------------\n#gravel #bikepacking #cycling #giantrevolt #peakdistrict #yorkshire #tordivide #tourdivide",

          "transcript": "Here he is. How you getting on? So, here\nwe are. Tour divide. Um, I've had a\nright bit of luck here. So, Miss has\nsaid, \"You can take the car.\" So, I\nmanaged to bring all my extra camping\nstuff. So, the extra bit I put in there\nabout the fully loaded bike, just\ndisregard it. I'm still going to put in\nthe video cuz it's helpful for some\npeople doing events like this in the\nfuture. So, I've just put my tent up.\nIt's looking like an absolute mess. I\nreally don't care. Um, and look how\ncockeyed it is compared to Joe's.\nUh, so like I said before, I haven't got\nthe inner. I've literally just need a\ntar here. I've got all my camping stuff.\nUm, and tomorrow I'm literally going to\nbe riding with a down jacket, maybe a\nrain jacket. I'm not too sure yet. And\nemergency foil blanket, and that's about\nit. So, goodbye. Fully loaded bike. Uh,\nshould save probably about 8 or 9 kilos\non that. And should uh, in theory make\nthe ride a little bit faster, if not\neasier. So, let's get some Thai food\nfrom the village just over there. Got a\ncouple of sig girls and I think then\nwe'll be calling it a night. See you in\nthe morning.\n[Music]\nMorning guys. Here we are at the start\nline. Um, not just me. There's loads of\nother people doing the event as well.\nUm, yeah, I'm really looking forward to\ngetting stuck into riding with your mate\nJack from Venture Racing. Uh, you'll\nprobably see him later on in the video.\nHe's just sorting his car out at the\nminute. So, today we've got 123 miles\nand about 11,500 ft climbing, but\nknowing um, Wahoo\nKimoot the Strava, they'll probably say\nsomething close in the region of 12\n12,000. So, let's see what happens. At\nthe minute, it's looking pretty gray and\ndull out there. It's supposed to be\nabout 20° later on in the afternoon. So,\nlet's just see how we get it going and\nI'll check in soon.\nBoy, this is pretty hard, you know.\nAbout 7 milesi in. I' only done about\n1500 ft of climbing. I lost Jack after\nabout 10 minutes. So, he's just like\nflown off into the distance.\nI don't know where I'm now.\nSome sort of quarry.\nAnd yeah, the uh the excitement of going\nstraight out of the gate is starting to\npay now. So, I just need to hold it back\na little bit. Remember, I've got another\n117 miles or so to go. Still 38 summits.\nI'm only on summit number four, 1 hour\ninto it. So, I'm going to shut up for a\nbit. Just keep pushing on.\nHere is the famous broken road at\nMammour.\nSo apparently they've tried to repair it\na few times and eventually just given\nup. Um I'm not sure if that's the worst\npart. I'll probably find out when I get\naround there. But you can see there the\ntarmac where it's just completely\nlandslid.\nYeah.\nFun fact, I need to catch a breath back\ncuz I'm absolutely knackered.\nAbout 2,000 ft now in 12 miles. I'm just\nhoping it's really going to let off\nsoon, but who knows? Just keep drinking\nand eating. Yeah.\nIt was going so well. Now look at it.\nGood opportunity to get a breather\nanyway.\nHope to get through this section.\nGet some speed back. Look at it.\nabout 27 miles ticked off now. It's uh\nalmost a quarter of the way for it.\nFeeling good at the minute, but\nI don't know if I can maintain his pace\nfor too much longer. Uh just see how we\ngo.\nJust coming on to the Monsole trail now.\nSo this is about 7 mile section. Uh,\npretty flat, nice smooth, fast rolling\ngravel as well. It's time to get the\nhead down and uh see what how long it's\ngoing to take to do this bit.\nAnother spooky tunnel.\nCome to set this. Look at that.\nrelax.\nAll right.\nSun's finally coming out now, so I just\ndecided to take the rain jacket off.\nLeaving the thermal cap on for now cuz\nmy head's going to be soaking wet\nunderneath and it'll get cold quickly.\nHad a quick glove change as well. I'm\nonly 50 mi in and I'm getting really,\nreally hungry. I've only got gels around\nhere, but I could do with some solid\nfood, you know. So, I'm going to try and\nfind somewhere soon. And I think I hit B\nwell in about an hour and a half. So\nI'll just try and make go for now. Few\nmore gels and grab a couple of really\nsalty sandwiches at the petrol garage\nthere. Top up the liquids. Get straight\nback on. I think so far the stoppage\ntime is about 35 minutes for the entire\nday. So I'm happy with that. Just going\nto want to see if I can push on and get\na sub 11 finish time. But who knows? I\ndon't really know what lies ahead.\nAnyway, back to it.\nSo, the sun's come out now.\nIt is warm.\nI got some forest hiker bike cuz I'm\nreally running out of energy.\nSave myself and get to bake roll and get\nloads and loads of food. I can't wait.\nStay at this.\nOh my god.\n81 miles in now. And you know when you\nhit that kind of mental physical block,\nstart talking yourself out of a ride.\nYou think you can have a really bit off\nmore than shoe. I just g up this 18%\nclimb down there.\nI don't even know where I am. The sun is\nso hot\nand I think I still got about another\nfour four and a half hours of actual\nride time left.\nYou know, it's kind of at that point\nwhere you're thinking,\nwhat am I doing?\nYou probably just g up a big climb. So,\nI'm going to keep telling myself that\nand just uh pray there's some downhill\ncoming and some more road sections cuz\nI don't really know if I've got another\nfour hours left in me to be honest. Uh\nespecially if the sun keeps up like it\nis now.\nIs a blue sky day.\nAh,\nheat.\nRight, mile 101. Would you believe it?\n22 to go.\nUh, ride time 8 hours 40, 10,000 ft.\nSo, I potentially got 1 to 2,000 ft of\nclimbing over the next 20 mi. Doesn't\nsound too good, does it? I think we're\nabout to go around Derwent Reservoir\nor something. It's half past 6 at night.\nSo, with a bit of luck, I might be back\nat camp for 8:00 p.m. or just after 8:00\np.m. maybe. My skin is starting to hurt\nnow, so I put a load of sun cream on cuz\nI kind of forgot this morning. We're\nnearly there. We're nearly there.\nI just wanted to say cuz I haven't said\nit today. I am sick to death of these.\nI've lost count of how many of these I\nhave opened and closed today. I'm done.\nBut saying that, there was loads more on\nuh Headwaters Trail, Yorkshire Divide I\ndid the other week. But yeah, you sort\nof seem to find that so many gates have\na slightly different um mechanism. So\nit's like a gate puzzle or gate roulette\nor what what one you're going to get\neach time.\n[Applause]\nSo, we're back at HQ now. It's been a\nmental day as hell. Uh, I've got 10\nhours 20 moving time, I think it is.\nAnd funny enough, I thought I was going\nreally slow, but I actually come in\nthird place overall. So, I'm well stoked\nto that. Uh, congrats to to Jack Debuke\nConventure Racing. Buddy has started. He\ncome second. And yeah, it's just been a\nreally really good day actually overall.\nUm, just had a beer and some pasta that\nuh Valeros um him and his MS have cooked\nus. And uh yeah, I think I'm just going\nto pack up the tent now and hit the\nroad. Um so yeah, big shout out to\nValero and uh his wife and all the\nsupport team who've been here the whole\nweekend and highly recommend doing these\ntour divides. It's my first one. I'll\nprobably be about next year and do the\ngravel again. But I think I need a bike\nwith a suspension fork because I'm in\npain a lot. That's it for now. See you\nnext time. Here is the rig\nand everything I've got on it. So, the\nbike giant Revolt Advance 0 Shimano GRX\ncassette is the 1134\nCadex CXR1 wheel set with the Pirelli\nCinato Gravelm tubeless ready 45 mil.\nOn the back, we've got the uh oh, sorry.\nWe've got the giant diffuse handlebars.\nGet to those in a minute. And we've got\nthe SDG component saddle\nthere from the guys at Silverfish.\nSo, in the kit, we've got the Rella 15 L\nsaddle pack. It's almost full to the\ntop. It's a really good bit kit that is\nnight rider light at the back for the\nnighttime riding. Two Elite Fly bottles,\na 750, a 550. And I'm gonna be carrying\na 2 liter camel back uh hydration pack\non my back. We've got the Rell 4 liter\nframe bag. Roswell, if you can see that,\nRoswell 9 liter up front as well. And\nwe've just got like a normal Amazon\nlight here. A bell cuz we're going to be\non a lot of um tracks and trails and\nstuff with walkers this weekend. And got\nthe Leine uh 600\nlumens light. So, both of these are\ngoing to be used at nighttime because\nbecause I think I'm looking to finish\nevent around about 11:00 p.m. We'll see.\nAnd obviously the wire here up front\nwith the giant mount.\nSo, quickly touching on the what's in\nthe packs. So, in the back of the pack,\nI've got the Outkit Tarst Star one. I'm\nleaving the inner at home literally just\nto save a few hundred grams. I know it\nsounds pathetic, but the bike uh total\nweight, we'll get into that in a minute.\nIt's quite heavy. And in there, I've got\nsome uh thermal clothing. So, top and\nbottoms. I've got a couple of emergency\nfoil sheets. I've got a padded jacket\nthat's been packed down. A top ground\nsheet because I'm not taking the inner.\nUp front, I've got a another jacket, a\nsleeping bag. It's just literally a\nsummer one again to save a few hundred\ngrams. I know I'm going to be cold at\nnight. I've also got a thermal skull cap\nand some gloves and thermal socks to\nsleep in. In here, I've literally just\ngot um tons and tons of nutrition. So,\nI' got some Voom bars, uh, high five,\nsome hydration. This can be quite hot,\ngood old stun cream. Uh, I've got my\nsaddle pack, the Lei Mini Caddy I think\nit's called, because usually it' be\nunder there. And I haven't got access\naccess that obviously cuz with this\nbeing a fully unsported ride, you have\nto ride with all of your kit, which is a\nbit unfortunate, but hey, it's a spirit\nof gravel and gravel bike packing. And\njust on here on the other side, I've got\nsome more gels. Uh some of these stero\nrice bars,\napple cinnamon, caramel ones. They're\npretty good. Uh and also I've got a a\ntorch just to be using at night camp uh\nwith me staying there on a Friday night\nbefore and obviously on the Saturday\nnight. Um it's going to be dark when I'm\npitching the tent. And I'm sure that's\npretty much the run through.\nUm, so all of this together, 16 kilos\npretty much bang on on the dial. I think\nusually the bike is about 8 1/2 or 8.7\ngive or take. Um, so that 16 kilos\nincludes both of these bottles being\nfull as well. So overall, yeah,\ndouble double the bike sort of weight\nthere. 123 miles.\nIt's going to be long.",

Terrain features very rocky technical descents that force walking, boggy sections especially after rain, and roads with extreme drop-offs. The unsupported format allows 32 hours to complete with options to sleep or ride through. Riders report completing 20% of climbing in first 30k. Mandatory kit includes 1.5 liters of water. Route shares space with walkers, horse riders, and motor bikers. Weather can bring consistent rain making conditions more challenging.
