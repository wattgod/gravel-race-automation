Strada dei Cannoni features rocks that punish anything under 47mm tires. Massive rockslides can wipe away roads completely - one rider descended 1,000m to find the road gone, forcing a choice between retracing steps or sketching across scattered rocks. The hike-a-bike sections are genuinely steep - 4 hours pushing bikes while being overtaken by hikers with trekking poles.",
