The backdrop of Europe's highest mountains never cease to take our breath away, but we couldn’t prepare ourselves for quite how spectacular his journey would be.\n\nAs an event in-between all Joachim’s annual long-distance competitions the \"Torino-Nice Rally\" seemed to be the perfect 'recovery’ ride, without pressure, and ‘only' 20,000m of elevation. The rally made such an impression on him that he’s already signed up for the 2017 edition again….to see what exactly brought him back for a repeat visit check out the video, and if you’re tempted to ride it yourself be sure to say ”Hi” to him in Turin. \n\nRider: Joachim Rosenlund (bombtrack.com/team/joachim/) \n Production: Tina Lagler & Blaž Miklič / OSM Films (osmfilms.com)\n Sounddesign: Guido Craveiro at Pork & Rabbit Studios, Pulheim \n Graphic Design: Marko Šajn / cognitive-state.com\n Music: Homeless Atlantic “Newfoundland” & “Drift”, Dana Boulé “Clichy Waltz”\n\nMore information about the event: torino-nice.weebly.com/ \nMore information about the bike: bombtrack.com/bikes/hook-ext/ \n\nHomeless Atlantic’s “Newfoundland” and “Drift” appears courtesy of copyright control and is taken from the longplayer “The North Passage”\n\ninstagram.com/bombtrackbicycleco/ \nbombtrackbicycleco.tumblr.com/\ntwitter.com/Bombtrack17 \nfacebook.com/344264558942333\n\nHomeless Atlantic are Matt Gutteridge and Sean Crookes.

In 2023 we headed out to Torino Italy with the aim of riding the whole of the 800+ km of the Torino Nice Rally from the \"Unofficial\" Group start.  \n\nWe were completely blown away, not just by the entire day long climbs, but the absolutely stunning views and  simply spectacular scenery.  Riding along observing the way of life in these Alpine areas was such a break from the modern day of UK Life.  \n\nWe used our tent all of the nights, wild camping  and staying in the grounds of the Mountain Refuges.  The whole experience was overwhelming and had a huge impact on our desire to explore more of the world by bike. \n\nIf. you would like more information on the route please don't hesitate to check out their webiste. \nhttps://torino-nice.weebly.com/intro.html",

          "transcript": "So, we made it to the start of the\nTorino Nice Rally. So, this is uh\nMonday.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, Monday. Monday,\n&gt;&gt; 4th of September. And uh everybody's\njust getting their pictures taken at the\nstatue in the in the square before we\nset off for what's the first climb of\nthe day?\n&gt;&gt; The Colombardo climb is uh the one that\neverybody's talking about.\n&gt;&gt; So, it's one of the a big hitter at the\nright in the first day and uh we'll see\nhow far we get after that.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, welcome along and uh yeah,\nhope you enjoy following the journey\nwith us. This is our first time on the\nToino Nice Rally and uh\n&gt;&gt; yeah, it's been quite an adventure just\ngetting here. We probably could have\nfilled two memory cards with the drama,\nbut hopefully there'll be a little less\ndrama on the trail and it's just uh\npedaling albeit over lots of mountains.\n&gt;&gt; Yes. So, super excited and daunted at\nthe same time. Not sure which which is\nhigher.\n&gt;&gt; Lots of nice people though. So, uh we're\ngoing to go and get started.\nHi.\nHello. Hello. Heat.\nHeat.\nHa.\nShe's always fast in the back wheel of\nanother bike. So, it's time for her\nfirst pit stop. How How many KS do you\nthink we've done?\n&gt;&gt; 40.\n&gt;&gt; Maybe 40. Maybe 40ishks. We seem to have\nleft the small towns and things. Been a\nlittle bit on the road this morning\ntrying to get out to the mountains.\n&gt;&gt; So, we spotted the hill, I guess, and\ndecided must be time for a tit. So, we\ntry and keep moving a little bit and uh\neat a little bit of roadside snackage\nand then move on quite quickly and just\nkeep turning pedals. Don't stop pedaling\nreally. And that's uh how we hope to try\nand get through the distance and all the\nelevation and uh slowly but surely. I\nthink\n&gt;&gt; untested with this level of elevation. I\nthink we just got to try it and see how\nwe get on.\n&gt;&gt; Okay. So, see how we go.\nHeat. Heat.\nYes. Yeah. Yeah. All good.\nYeah, I think the fire\nSo, we're only about 500 meters from the\ntop of the Caldell Colombardo. It has\nbeen a huge climb. Biggest climb we've\never done. And uh we've been walking\nquite a large amount of it is just uh\nsuch a long climb. You're so tired. And\nalso we're at a very high now. Still got\na bit to go. Um it's quite spectacular.\nI I've been in some of the mountains in\nBavaria and Germany before, but this\nstill feels totally epic. Totally much\nbigger. And this is such a start to our\nadventure.\nUnbelievable.\nYeah, what a way to start the Reno\nDenise rally.\nNo birds.\nHeat. Heat. N.\nThis is breathtaking.\nWow.\n&gt;&gt; How amazing is this?\n&gt;&gt; It is. I'm just lost for words,\nactually. I think this is the most\nspectacularly beautiful place I've ever\nseen in my life.\nHard hard one views, but wow.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. When the biggest climb of your\nlife also comes with the biggest view of\nyour life, it's not a disappointment.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. And that certainly was the biggest\nclimb of my life. That was proper hard.\nStay left.\nGo left.\nI'll get you going down that long\ndescent.\nWhat do\nToday's call\n&gt;&gt; call delinestra.\n&gt;&gt; This is the start of our official call\nfor the day, but uh feels like we've had\nquite a climb to get to the climb.\nSo, uh, yeah, and I think this one\nshould be quite a big one, but hopefully\na bit bit easier than the Colombardo.\nThat was proper hard yesterday.\n&gt;&gt; Typical Italian relax style. We were\n&gt;&gt; dining at 10:00.\n&gt;&gt; Dining at 10:00 p.m. And we were still\ntrying to find a pitch at 11:00 p.m.\n&gt;&gt; And finally uh got our heads down about\nmidnight.\n&gt;&gt; Perfect pitch, though.\n&gt;&gt; Was flat flat grass.\n&gt;&gt; Flat grass. A little bit under a bridge.\nAlways good.\n&gt;&gt; And a sauna in the river. a sauna in the\ntent at about 4:00 in the morning. It\nwas roasting.\n&gt;&gt; Oh, I don't mean sauna. I mean, what do\nI mean?\n&gt;&gt; A spa.\n&gt;&gt; Spa.\n&gt;&gt; Spa. Yeah, it was I think it was\nprobably 24 25° inside the tent and no\nsleep. I didn't even get my sleeping bag\nout of the pack. I just lay on top of my\nmat, on top of my liner. Unbelievable\ntemperature. So, this is uh we're\ncertainly been acclimatized, I think.\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\n&gt;&gt; that's what they say in the guide. day\none. So that that gives a bit of\nconfidence, I think.\n&gt;&gt; So we've got some options. So I need to\ncheck the map.\nmuch faster than we look.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, we are.\n&gt;&gt; He's put it in slow-mo, hasn't he?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.\nquite a sunny a start. There's still\nquite a lot of cloud.\nUh but the surface of the road up this\ncall is tarmac up to about halfway and\nthen it turns into gravel, I'm informed.\nUh but there certainly, even though the\nsun's not out, it's still very humid.\nAnd uh so this is the the sweat line\nstarts here and it goes down and this is\nwhere the sweat line is now. So drinking\na lot and having a lot of sweets. But\nthis is absolutely beautiful climb. We\nare uh sharing it with quite a lot of\nthe off-road motorcycles and overlanding\n4x4s that are you can access the higher\nmountains here in those. So but they've\nall been very good so I haven't had any\nproblems. Uh plenty of room.\nUh the climb still has much further to\ngo. We've been climbing for um what\nfeels like a couple of hours. Um we\nstarted\ndown here\nuh in uh small susa. Climbed\na lot of switchbacks\nto get up and now we're kind of out on a\npoint. So, taking a little rest here,\nbut you can see we still have all the\nway all the way up up up up to the top\nthe coal del Fiesta Finestra\nThis is the first blue sky we have seen\nsince we got yesterday.\n&gt;&gt; Climbing all day this day half past 5\nand it's just been apart from we had one\nlittle descent but really short. Other\nthan that, it's been climbing, climbing,\nclimbing, and we we haven't been able to\nsee the views, but\num hoping now that sun's coming out and\nthere's blue sky up there. When we get\nto the top, we might just get rewarded\nand all those views open up and show us\nwhere we are. And this is Lassietta.\ntime\n&gt;&gt; and uh two me two kilometers past the\nCasiata top apparently there's a cafe\nmountain refuge type place uh 2 km\nfurther on. We're really hoping we can\nget our dinner there.\n&gt;&gt; I think they do ravioli.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the they better do something\nthat's better than two bananas and a\npacket of fruit pastels, which is the\nthe diet of the evening if we do not get\nto the cafe.\nSo, let's go.\nSo earlier we were a bit down a little\ndown in the dumps because we'd been\nriding all day and\n&gt;&gt; I didn't moan at all\n&gt;&gt; and a little bit just like I tell her\nit's a little bit further.\nSo, uh, but however,\njust\nin 360° panoramic\nalpine beauty,\n&gt;&gt; it's not bad, is it?\n&gt;&gt; Is that a reward? Do you think it's a\nreward? I think it's a reward.\n&gt;&gt; If I knew I was going to get that, I\nwould have been a whole lot happier.\nWell, I'll be a whole lot happier if the\nrefugeio\naceta\n&gt;&gt; in about 2 km up that\n&gt;&gt; I'm on that ravioli\n&gt;&gt; has anything that is carbohydrate based\nthat would be fantastic.\nWell,\nwhat a day.\nYeah,\nI need\nAmazing.\nSo we're in the tunnel just after Crier.\nTactical change of color of top and\nwe've got our lights on.\nBecause the noise in here is\nunbelievable when the lries come\nthrough. It's amazing. But we have to\ngo.\nWell, here we are. We are in France now.\nWe've ridden through most of or not most\nof Italy, but a bit of Italy, some\nreally high mountains, and we're living\nour best life. Just having some\nsandwiches\nand some food behind some dumpsters at\nthe back of a supermarket.\nfor sure.\n&gt;&gt; So, it's here at uh Chavar's I'll put\nthe name below that we make a split in\nthe route. We have an option of taking\nthe cold desire which is that road over\nthere or we continue up the valley to\ntake on cold to pee which includes a\nhike a bike single track climb with bike\ncarry and then a descent on some single\ntrack mountain biking on the other side.\nIt's the off-road route, the proper\noff-road route for the Torino Nice\nRally. And right up until today, we\ndidn't know if that would be even\npossible because there has been forestry\nworks on the route. That a couple of\nriders ahead, including a Martin\nHoffman, uh, passback messages to say\nthat the there was no workers and\noperations were complete, although the\nroad was still a bit rough that you\ncould get through. So, that's\nincentivized us to give it a try.\nWe are probably a little bit behind in\ndistance than maybe we expected to be at\nthis point in day three.\nUh but this is a notable section of the\nrally and we really wanted to do it. So\nwe'll accept that maybe we'll have to\ntake a shortcut a little bit further on\nanother couple hundred kilometers so as\nthat we still get to the finish in seven\ndays. We have uh high hopes.\nYou can only imagine what this\nenvironment must be like in heavy\nrainfalls and monsoon season and sort of\nwhen the water's torrenting down here\nand they just put a concrete across the\nroad and the river continues\nstraight down into the valley.\nSo, is all your Scottish hiker biking?\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Prepared you.\nGet plenty of that.\n&gt;&gt; I called the piece.\n&gt;&gt; This is flame bacon.\nJust an ankle just filing.\nway way up there. That's where we're\ngoing.\nThe sign said 2 and 1 half hours walking\nwith no bikes.\nThat would make it 11:00 p.m. from the\ntime we\n&gt;&gt; So, we'll we'll let you know how it\ngoes. Maybe tomorrow. Maybe tomorrow.\nOkay, so we've got a pitch on the cold\npeas and we are currently at\n2,198\nm,\nwhich is the probably about the highest\nI've camped, I think. Uh, that's\ncertainly getting a lot colder as soon\nas they uh went dark really quickly and\nthen dew just started forming on\neverything like that was metal and the\nbikes and then equipment that was left\noutside and stuff. So,\nWe've got it all in the tent. We're just\ngoing to get a little wash up and uh get\nour heads down. It's been a big day.\nThat says just over 5° and that's with\na little bit of the sun coming up. It's\nquite a chilly night.\nThat's camp broken down. And we're going\nto come off up there. Our little path\nshould hopefully just be here. And there\nwere some other campers last night over\nthere. Not they're not over the rally\nthough, just some walkers. Breakfast\nthis morning consists of some cheesy\nonion type bread.\n&gt;&gt; Um\n&gt;&gt; I don't think there's been too many of\nthe TNR riders have chosen to come this\nway. This is um very much more sort of\noff-road.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the hiker bike and also the route\nwasn't really thought to be properly\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. achievable until yesterday.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we didn't know whether there was\nmaybe forestry works and things like\nthat. So, I don't think there'll be too\nmany. Somebody went ahead. There's at\nleast one.\n&gt;&gt; Um, but I think the others have gone up\nthe classic uh is\nclimb on the tour to France. You\n&gt;&gt; warmed up. So,\n&gt;&gt; I will in a minute when we start\nclimbing\n&gt;&gt; once we start climbing. That's the\nmotivation is to get up to where the sun\nis uh and get a little warm up. So,\nshoot. See you up top.\ndo more leg presses in the gym.\nI think you're doing your year's worth\nof leg presses right now.\nYes, we're definitely conditioned for\nshoving heavy loaded bikes up stupid\nhills.\nThey weren't wrong. This bit was hard.\n&gt;&gt; We've been told many things are hard\nloss. We've still done them.\n&gt;&gt; We're slow learners. Clearly,\n&gt;&gt; and we're doing this with a drone shot\non the other side.\nIt's got to be worth\nthe like and subscribe.\nGuilt. Guilt. Pure guilt. That should\nThat should all you be should be\nwatching right now in your living room\ncuz I'll be sitting in my living room\nwatching it soon enough.\n&gt;&gt; They were quite gravel orientated and\nCan I pass you?\nSo\nthis\nis the final kicker. A little bit easy\njust here.\nA little bit easy for and then you'll\nsee\nthey are heading up that way to the\nsummit of this call.\nSo much uh climbing later. And we've got\nthe bags back on the bike. And look at\nthese mountains.\nJust this silence.\nNo motorbikes, no cars.\nAnd the top\nis just around there in this saddle.\nAbsolutely fabulous.\nSo, the little thing that I put in my\nmouth normally that holds the GoPro just\nlike that or like that, it just snapped\nyesterday. So trying to do these BMS\nwith one hand.\nIt's a little tricky.\nneed to be slowing.\nbe able to see we're now in the shade\nover there. The sunlight is rising. The\nshade is becoming more. And in about 30\nminutes, maybe this whole valley will be\nin uh shade, not darkness yet. It's only\njust gone 6:00 p.m. a little bit. 6:15.\nThere is a mountain refuge.\nUh that is\n&gt;&gt; see the marmet right across the road.\n&gt;&gt; We're both laughing cuz a marmmet just\ndid a dash across the road. We've been\nmarmmet spotting. This is the game of\nthe trip, isn't it?\n&gt;&gt; Some marmet pointing the wrong way.\nRight. The marmet is more interesting.\n&gt;&gt; Oh, she says\n&gt;&gt; the marmet has a very uh a range of\nbottom colors in the marmets as well.\nyellows and conquers and suit.\n&gt;&gt; So anyway, marmets aside, it's going to\nonly get colder now as we start the rest\nof the climb. We've got about 4 km to\nthe big switchbacks and then the final\nkicker, which is really quite steep. I\nthink we might even be just walking that\nuh the final 3k\nand\n&gt;&gt; starting shore,\n&gt;&gt; we'll be at 2,700\nm.\nby bike.\nHow many Ben Nees is that\nSo, we still have to go up there one\nswitch back and around the back of this\nhump. And I believe\nthat that is the refuge\nover there.\nZoom in a little.\nYeah.\nSo, we'll see. Could be that building.\nBut unfortunately,\nwe are I think tea served maybe at 7.\nSo, I don't think we might get dinner.\nSo, the kitchen is closed for the night,\nbut we can put our tent up. There is uh\na few spaces. What a view that we all\nhave. And we can uh get a shower and\nmaybe we can get breakfast if we ask\nvery nicely.\nWe don't know.\nQuick.\nSo this morning we descended the co\nangel\nwhich was about a 1,700 m descent\nand we're paying that all back\nin Spadfuls. So, we went down into\nSierre and we're now doing the cold\nSierre over the other side where there\nshould be a brilliant hopefully off-road\ngravel descent for maybe 20 km.\nAnd after that, um maybe there's a\ncampsite, maybe we camp somewhere wild.\nI think we're going to be on this climb\nfor a good few hours.\nSo, when we've done Rome Scotland\nrallies before, I've done the 7-day\ntours, normally day four we call like a\nhump day or a pivot day. how we're\nfeeling. If we get that far, we maybe\nget to the end. I think with the TNR,\nthere's still too much to come that we\ndon't know in the climbing and hiker\nbiking. So, listen to those cowbells.\nSo, but physically\nLindsay and I today are both finding\nourselves a little maybe better, more\nmore consistent riding even at the\nheight. The last two nights, maybe\nthree, we've spent above 2,000 mters or\naround about somewhere between 1,700 and\n2,200,\nnearly 2,600 last night. and coughing\nsuch dry air that even in complete\ndarkness, no sunlight, hardly any wind,\nthe air is so dry, we could do our\nwashing and all our clothes were boom\ndry in the morning just because of the\nair up here at this elevation\nis so dry.\nIt just means you have to drink and\ndrink and drink. So\nthis is uh they're called sierre.\nApologies for the pronunciation,\nbut\nit's been quite consistent. It has been\nquite kind, I think, to us. And also,\nwe've had quite a lot of tree coverage\nfor shade, which makes a huge difference\nbecause we started it at 12:30 in peak\nsunshine.\nUh, so the head of the mountain looks\nmaybe as though it's in the clouds. So,\nI don't know if we'll actually get a\nview from the top, but\nman, man. Day five.\nAh,\nnow back in the clouds.\nWell, we have earned this view for sure.\nmissile on yesterday.\n&gt;&gt; No\ndifferent kind of gear.\ngoing towards us.\nI think. Not sure.\nSo, after a short day yesterday,\ntoday's turned into an absolute whopper.\nWe're at about 90k.\nHold on.\nAbout 90k. We're outside a town called\nStropo.\nReally hoping we can find a bar\nrestaurant for some food. There's a\ncampsite further along.\nAnd uh yeah, massive day, but that's\nwhat we needed. Short day yesterday cuz\nof the off-road climbing and called the\npeas.\nBut today we've had plenty of caves. So\nlet's hope Stop is a great stop for us.\nThat's olive oil.\nTwo cheese sandwiches.\nIt's pretty tough.\n&gt;&gt; What do you think?\n&gt;&gt; It is really, really tough. And I think\nthe fatigue, cumulative fatigue,\n&gt;&gt; probably setting in by now, but\n&gt;&gt; maybe maybe getting a bit more adapted\nto being at altitude because that was\nreally found that really hard the first\nfew days\n&gt;&gt; just feeling breathless even even\nsitting in the tent feeling out of\nbreath, feeling the rib cage going like\na bellows, just resting. Um, so I don't\nthink I'm naturally adapted to being up\nhigh in the mountains, unfortunately.\nBut\n&gt;&gt; so this is a cold pret which is on the\nhiker bike route for this part of the\nTNR\n&gt;&gt; except just um for point of note, we're\nnot supposed to be hiker biking yet. We\nhaven't actually reached the hiker bike.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, this is the part where you start\nwalking. It's up the hill.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n&gt;&gt; you're supposed to be able to ride this,\n&gt;&gt; we haven't actually reached the climb\nyet.\nBut we we we'll tell people we've been\nclimbing for hours,\nhours and hours. And uh if you hold on\none second, we are at a switchback,\nwhich means there is a view mostly.\nMaybe a little bit obscured by trees,\nbut you can't really see.\nall the way down there, that is like\n2/ird of the way up. There's still\ntwo/ird of the climb below the furthest\nyou can see.\n&gt;&gt; But I think the advantage to this is\nthat it does vary up which bit of your\nbody is is uh\n&gt;&gt; taking the beating.\n&gt;&gt; this this climb has been different.\nWe've had this really open mountain\nrange and like a cauldron all the way\naround us 360°\nand it's just given us jaw-dropping\nviews the whole climb which is the\nopposite of being in the cloud the whole\ntime.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. And it's a bit different\nmuscle work again because it's been so\nincredibly steep instead of just being\nlong and like a slog.\n&gt;&gt; I don't know about short steady\n&gt;&gt; but it's certainly been steep.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, we're going to get to the top of\nthe call which is like a saddle between\nthe two peaks and then we actually have\nto hike up one of the sides to almost\nthe summit. So\n&gt;&gt; after some lunch.\n&gt;&gt; After lunch. Yeah, it's definitely after\nlunch.\n&gt;&gt; More mentos.\nIt's a slightly\nsweatb band. Lindsy thinks slick. I look\nlike a total knob. But\n&gt;&gt; you look like a knob.\n&gt;&gt; Uhhuh. My sweatb band.\nBut you can't, you know, you can't take\nwhat other people think of you too,\nespecially when you're uh riding\ntogether for a substantial period of\ntime too seriously. But to some extent,\nI do agree and that's why it hasn't\nappeared in the video so far.\nHowever, it does stop all the water\ngoing into my eyes. Uh so yeah,\n&gt;&gt; where is this lunch?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, lunch is coming.\n&gt;&gt; Never mind. YouTubers, come on.\n&gt;&gt; Lunch is in the back of my bag, which is\nwhy she's asking. So, tactical stop.\nWe're in the shade. Basically, as soon\nas we get to the call, uh it's totally\nopen. No, there's no protection from the\nsun for uh and that's only 300 mters\naround the corner. So, we have this nice\nlittle cool shady spot. Share it with\nthe lizards and uh yeah, best get dinner\nout. So, uh nutrition carrying your food\nand deciding what you're going to take\nuh and how far you can carry it with\nfresh food is very difficult. It's so\nhot. It's about 28°. So, we discovered\nthese, which are\nuh couscous pots uh with like couscous\nsalad with peas and tomatoes and uh tuna\nin it, but you don't need to refrigerate\nthem and you can keep them in the bag\nfor several days.\n&gt;&gt; Is it good?\n&gt;&gt; Mhm.\n&gt;&gt; Moist.\n&gt;&gt; Nice. Moist. And there's tuna and peas\nand all sorts in there.\ncalled the Prit\n2,00 283 m.\nThis has to be quite possibly the most\nbeautiful part of the route so far for\njust mountain views.\nAbsolutely incredible.\nIt's worth the long push. Definitely\nworth the long push. But there's only, I\nthink, so many more days we can do 6 or\n8,000 feet of climbing a day.\nI'm glad we got this far. This is\nabsolutely spectacular.\nAll\nright.\nWhat\nare you doing?\nDon't really have words.\nSo, we're transitioning now from this\nunbelievable view to\nthis view on the other side of the\nmountain range. And wow.\nThis is a little rough for the one hand.\nHey buddy,\ndon't\nwe all\n7 days in. Can't believe it. We've just\nhad some coffee and a quasonant in one\nof the villages in town on our route. So\nhopefully today and tomorrow we'll see\nus back to Nice. And today is to get\nover the cold tende uh which will take\nus back to France. So Lindsay is in the\nsupermarket just now and uh we're doing\na little bit of admin. So we are\ncleaning the chain. We carry a little\nrag. We have a little oil set in for\nsome shopping. We obviously had the\nmunchies.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Foot long bread sticks.\n&gt;&gt; Thought you might like that.\n&gt;&gt; A little pizza.\n&gt;&gt; What are those? I think they're sugary\nthings.\n&gt;&gt; Churros.\n&gt;&gt; Like churros. Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Those. They're tiny.\n&gt;&gt; Oh yeah. Cheese go flying.\n&gt;&gt; 100 more for sport.\nThat's how you break.\nSo this is the cold to attende uh which\nis one of the last calls. Thank you.\nThere will be some bit more climbing up\nand down on the way back, but\nthis is us leaving Italy and heading\nback to France.\n&gt;&gt; We can now leave now that I've had my\ngelato.\n&gt;&gt; She had some ice cream gelato and very\ntouristy little spot. Lemon\n&gt;&gt; lemon.\n&gt;&gt; Lemon lemon.\n&gt;&gt; Uh the uh abiore of Italy.\nSo unfortunately the path we were going\nto go down and the road is closed. It's\nopen for 15 minutes in the morning and\n15 minutes at night. So, we might have\nto take a dirt track which has all the\ntraffic going over it. Um, so that could\nbe interesting. So, we'll see how that\ngoes. For now, more water, more sugar,\nmore climbing.\nWell, goodbye Italy. Hello France.\nAnd uh we are hopefully uh finished\ntonight and then one more day we will be\nin Nice and we'll be done.\nThat is a good sign to see of our little\ndiversion\nthat behind us.\nAnd this is the valley we're going into\ndown to Tend Tendi.\nAnd the road that we couldn't actually\nget down earlier because it was closed\nwill now be open.\nAnd Matteas, I think it's Matas. Was it\nMatas?\n&gt;&gt; Matas, the German guy\n&gt;&gt; um was uh\nRocky,\n&gt;&gt; just pay attention cuz you're on edge.\n&gt;&gt; She's boss. So he was waiting for it to\nopen. So, we'll have to see if we meet\nhim uh down there, but we've got a lot\nof descent.\nRespect.\nRespect nature.\nThat was a huge descent, wasn't it?\n&gt;&gt; Enormous. We're still We're still at uh\njust check 1,344.\nI think we've been descending for about\n40 minutes on some roughest tracks. So,\nuh yeah, let's get down to the village\nand get food.\nI don't like looking over that edge at\nall.\n&gt;&gt; What edge is that?\n&gt;&gt; Or would that be?\n&gt;&gt; I'm not looking.\n&gt;&gt; Would that be this edge? Ah,\nthis has turned into one of the most\ninsane descents that we've ever done in\nany mountain biking trip or adventure.\nWe're like descending for an hour and a\nbit now. And it's just the valley is\nincredible. It's absolutely amazing.\nThere's bats everywhere.\nBut yeah, we just had to stop and change\nto settle into these brake pads. It's\njust completely gone down to metal. No\nwonder.\nWe're getting some extra KS in for the\nSunday night. The roads are quiet. A\nmassive descent. Probably 30k down the\nvalley\nflying. It's absolutely brilliant.\n&gt;&gt; Tea time,\n&gt;&gt; right? Are we getting food?\n&gt;&gt; Yep. Tea time. I shall only have the\ntable. There we are.\n&gt;&gt; Excellent. And dinner is served.\nonly the table.\nThere we are.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; What we got tonight then?\n&gt;&gt; So,\nto set the scene, we have come down the\n28k. We're sleeping somewhere behind a\ngarage by a river just outside the town.\nSo, uh, and Lindsay is opening. Can you\nput it under the bike? I'm\n&gt;&gt; opening that.\nthis is we've been carrying this.\n&gt;&gt; Looks like cat food under the bike.\n&gt;&gt; So, that's dinner. I still have my\napple. Didn't eat it earlier on. We've\ngot some cashew nuts. And that is the\nend of our what 110K day,\n&gt;&gt; something like that.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. Crazy day.\n&gt;&gt; Really big big day. We couldn't record a\nlot of it um without the mouthpiece cuz\nthere was just hours of descending,\nwasn't there?\n&gt;&gt; Mhm. Yeah. There was there was so much\ndescending\n&gt;&gt; and then descending in the dark off a\nmountain side with sheer\n&gt;&gt; roof drops.\n&gt;&gt; Don't tell mom.\n&gt;&gt; Um but yeah, so we made it down to trend\nuh trend\n&gt;&gt; tend 10 tend\n&gt;&gt; tendi and then just yeah because it was\nso dark on a Sunday night there was no\ncars. There's nobody about so we just\nyeah we absolutely flew down the main\nroad made massive time.\n&gt;&gt; Excuse me. So I took in\n&gt;&gt; she's she's off for dinner. Meanwhile,\njuicy apple. See you tomorrow.\nHappy days.\nThe last descent to\nWe've arrived at the cafe list in this.\nWe're all done.",

          "transcript": "foreign\n[Music]\n2022 and the start of the sixth Torino\nnice rally\nthis is my story of my ride and it\ndoesn't start with everyone else\nand this is the official start point of\nthe Turin nice rally tomorrow there will\nbe more than a hundred Riders here for\nthe off today it's just me\nthis feels like The Italian Job when\nthere's one route out of Turin and you\nhave to find it\nthis is where we're headed a series of\nrough gravel roads blasted into the high\nAlps by the Italian military most over 2\n000 meters high there's not one route\nfor the Torino nice rally we each have\nto make a series of choices along the\nway based on our abilities and\naccumulated fatigue we link the gravel\nroads together by tackling famous Road\nclimbs over classic coals and we'll flit\nbetween Italy and France although this\nis somewhere it shouldn't really be a\nclosed Road known fondly as the death\nRoad due to the risk of rockfall that is\nreclaiming it for nature\novernights are in Mountain refuges tents\nand bivouacs and the 700 kilometer route\ncan take anything from 5 to 10 days all\nthat lies ahead of me as I tackle my\nfirst big climb\nafter the dead straight approach to the\nmountains the colombardo is a brute\nbroken tarmac becomes loose gravel to\nthe 1800 meter cull then the TNR goes\nhigher still\nI'm kidding about this\nit's like riding up a wall\nah\nlooks like this is where it looks like\nthis is where it gets serious oh my God\nthat was the easy bit\nBardo\nthat let me stop\nthe colombardo that is eight hours\nyeah eight hours after leaving cheering\nthis morning including stops\nyou'll do it first\nalone over 2 000 meters high on my first\nday of riding this feels a very lonely\nexposed place\nwell I'm hoping that this really does\nMark the top of whatever I have been\nriding over I've been aiming for the\ncold columbard because I thought that\nwas the top turns out this is another\n200 meters almost past that but this is\nthe right way so fingers crossed it's\ndownhill from here\nI'll be ready for my dinner\nthis is the pattern when cycling in the\nAlps hours to climb up minutes to ride\ndown\nwow\neven when you get caught in a traffic\njam\nI've arranged a hotel with good food for\nmy first night because tomorrow will be\neven harder\nI have found myself in the middle of a\nGerman motor rally\nI think I'm getting hardly sick oh each\nto their own you've got to live in that\nlive\nI hoped the gravel would deter them but\nno motorbikes four-wheel drives and\nnormal cars over 20 years old about 150\nof them I was later told I'm trying to\nbe all Live and Let Live\nbut to be honest it is getting quite\ntedious this at least the four-wheel\ndrive people yeah unlike those\npass with millimeters\nthe four-wheel drive people know to hang\nback\ngive me a bit of space The Other Guys in\ntheir little classic cars they just\nBarrel on through no matter how close\nthey are\nnice Mustang wrong place\nthat's so many vehicles shared this and\nthe gravel roads ahead was an unpleasant\nsurprise of course if I hadn't started a\nday early I would not have met this\nrally I focused on the scenery and the\ncycling which is outstanding\n[Laughter]\nI do believe that's the summit\nit's crazy\nno no no no that's good for tonight is\nit cold it's cold cold yeah oh I'll have\na Coke thank you very much that's very\nkind the cars have to be 20 years old uh\nwe don't use any GPS or navigation just\nold school paper-based Maps as well as\nno no highways or Autobahn how we call\nit in Germany and we started like four\ndays ago in South spoken Austria and\nthen we have the Finish Line tomorrow\nnight at uh Central pay area this is\nwhere the European Mountain Summit ends\nbut some of the participants also go for\nthe European 5000 they go down to Spain\nthrough France and they have to finish\nline in Brussels it's part of their\nrally they have to fulfill a death\nchallenge every every day the crew does\nand today's is ride a bicycle at over 2\n000 meters so\nI should sell these\nfrom the motor chaos of the colder\nFinster my high point will be the cold\ndelacietta and after that my overnight\nobjective Casa acietta the first of\nthree refuges I'll use\nsadly I still have motorized company\nI was just hit by a car a green Audi\ncoming back down and it's Wing mirror\nhit my left brake lever and they didn't\nstop I think everything seems okay but\nI'm just recording this just in case it\nturns out something falls off my bike as\na result\nthis is the start of the strata acietta\nthe first of the spectacular Italian\nmilitary roads that are the centerpiece\nof the Torino nice rally\njudging by the Gathering of metal up\nhere\nthis is probably the colder theater\nthank you\nyes\nI find when they're out of the big\ntrucks\nright\nthis is what I have to tell you I have\nthe Refuge yasietta Casa booked however\nI've got a book for tomorrow night\nyes I can just feel my wife rolling her\neyes I got the dates wrong again\nso let's see where we end up\num\nno rooms but I can't eat here and half\npast seven and I can camp here oh I'm\nreally undecided I think I might stay\nhere although I would like to get on a\nbit\nI had a major dither before I decided\nwhat to do here you know but in fact I\nstarted to leave I came back and said\nthe guy look I'm sorry I'm being an\nidiot it's far more sensible for stay\nhere because it's going to be night when\nit hits history this is the right call\nin the next video we're in the high\nmountains above the clouds in the most\nspectacular of places it it's just a\nglorious place to be\nother Riders Catch Me\nAnd We link together two of the greatest\nRoad calls in the Alps see you at the\ntop\nin later videos we ride deeper into the\nmountains on Ancient roads\nwhere to get to a passing place and\nTangle with impatient modern drivers\nmy ride is split between four videos and\nthere are other practical videos for\nanyone attempting the TNR you'll find\nlinks and extra material on the\nresources page of my website and in the\nvideo descriptions\nsubscribe to make sure

          "transcript": "Here\nthey are altogether at the start\nabove average in age, some above average\nin waistline, and vastly below average\nin knowing their limits. Setting off\nfrom Turin, they were aiming to reach\nNice in 7 days.\nThis first day was to be quite typical\nof what was to come.\nWould they make it to Nice? I wouldn't\nbet on it.\nThe usual traffic getting out of a big\ncity like Churin negotiated safely\nthrough pretty villages and countryside.\nIt was all smiles as they progressed\nalong flat roads.\nAnd then this\nCole de Colombardo, a brute of a climb.\nThe smiles were gone as they wondered\nabout their life choices.\nAnd here they are living the dream, the\nuphill dream. Maybe this wasn't such a\ngood idea after all.\nAfter nearly 3 hours of climbing, they\nreached the top.\nThen reward sweeping gravel descents,\nthin mountain air, and views that make\nall the wheezing worthwhile. smiling\npolitely while vibrating violently with\na few wobbles.\nBack to the Souza Valley at the end of a\ntough first day,\nfinishing late into the evening.\nAfter a comfortable night in the village\nof Myana Duza at the foot of the famous\nGolo de Finestre Climb, the guys faced\nanother tough day of climbing.\nMuch of it on gravel.\nThis climb followed the route of stage\n20 of the 2025 Jiro Ditalia.\nThe first 9 km of the climb are on\ntarmac and then 8 km on gravel to the\ntop of the pass.\nThat's\nanother climb of almost 3 hours\ncompleted. 33 hairpin bends or dornanti\nin Italian.\nHappy faces again having completed the\nfirst climb of the day. A short coffee\nstop in a mountain refuge and then they\nwere back on the road\nand on to the next challenge of the day.\nThe Strada de lasetta.\nThe Strada is one of the most\nspectacular roads on the route.\nThe gravel was rough as they rattled\nalong, wondering if their fillings would\nsurvive.\nMarveling at the views,\ntheir bikes weighed between 17 and 20\nkg, luggage included.\nThe Strada de lasetta hovers between\n2,000 m and 2,500 m. The good thing\nabout being in Italy is that there are\nalways good lunch stops here. One of the\ndads is playing mom.\nMore bone jarring descents.\nIt's worth mentioning here that they had\nhad no mechanical mishaps on the trip.\nOne of them here hardly visible in full\ncamouflage.\nSome stretches were definitely more\nsuited to mountain bikes.\nThere were three gravel bikes and one\nmountain bike.\nCamouflage man going past again almost\nunnoticed.\nThere are five mini passes on the stra\ndeassieta. The cola basana,\nthe collesier, and the cola de la. Kind\nof useless information really. After all\nthat rough stuff, a welcome break back\nonto smooth tarmac for the descent\ntowards France. As always, ridden at\ngreat speed. And so to the border with\nFrance.\nNo cues here.\nUh, isn't this a pedestrian zone? The\nbeautiful town of Briansong, fortified\nby Vubon in the early 1700s.\nThe end of another long day in the\nsaddle.\nDay three. Now this was going to be\ntough. Two giant passes, the Isawir and\nthe anel, both used in grand tours.\nHowever, there was a problem.\nViolent storms were forecast for the\nwhole day, forcing the local authorities\nto close schools in the area and advise\nagainst unnecessary travel.\nSo, our heroes decided to skip this\nstage. While disappointing, they didn't\nmiss any gravel sections as this route\nwas only on tarmac.\nAnd now for the bikes, or rigs as they\ncall them in bike packing circles. The\nfirst one is a silver bike.\nThe next one is black with a yellow\nstripe.\nThis one is black.\nAnd another silver one.\nHey, wait a minute. Are those piers?\nAnd so we come to the Queen stage. By\nfar the toughest, but the most\nspectacular day of the trip.\nWith the storm having cleared, they set\noff under clear blue skies.\nUphill almost from the beginning.\nKestrel Tomb Falcon\nAnd so onto the Strada delgardeta, the\nmost anticipated segment. ment of the\ntrip. Despite the previous day's rest\nand with so much climbing again,\ncumulative tiredness was setting in.\nThis is the Aliplano stretch of the\nStrrada del Carteta.\nNamed after the high expansive plateau\nin the Andes,\nit was the most remote and beautiful\nsegment of the whole route.\nRiding late into the evening after yet\nanother long day, the rugged terrain\ntaking its toll on already tired bodies.\nThey finally began to descend to the\nnight's refuge,\nthe Rafuio Carbonetto at 1,874\nmeters.\nafter a comfortable night in the remote\nRafujio Carbonetto. It was all smiles\nagain. Even more so because this day\nstarted with downhill.\nWell muffled up against the cold morning\nair.\na glorious descent in sunshine and\nshade.\nThey got to wear all the warm clothes\nthey had carried all this way\n&gt;&gt; in the Val verminana. It was back to\nfull greenery after the baroness of the\nhigh mountains on the way to Verante at\nthe foot of the cold deton.\nSome taking the opportunity to rest\ntheir tender bottoms.\nAlways on the lookout for opportunities\nto refill water bottles, most villages\nalong the route had water fountains.\nAnd so it was back up into the mountains\nagain.\nThis time the culdeon with its 46 hair\npins\nand more toil.\nSettling into the next hours of ascent,\nriding their lowest gears again,\npast the ski station of Lemon 1400. All\nwith their uphill faces on now.\nOh yes, really\nmercifully quiet roads as the pace\nslowed.\nThe final kilometers of rough gravel to\nthe top of the cold dons were more\ndifficult than expected.\nThis is the fort de Margari built in\n1883 by the Italian military to defend\nthe culdeon against the French.\nThere are many imposing forts in this\narea, all built for the same reason.\nDay five and ongoing fatigue is limiting\nprogress. Even their best climber was\nbeginning to look a little unhappy.\nHi, Duncan.\nTaking photos is always a good excuse\nfor a rest.\nthe last ascent of the day before the\ngravel descent to the valley.\nAnd this was another rough one.\nDespite the rough roads, dangerous bends\nand exposure to the valleys below. There\nwere no crashes or injuries throughout\nthe trip.\nThe town of Tons coming into view meant\nthat the end of day five was near.\nOoh, getting quite close to Nice now.\nA relatively short day to Sbell, but\nwith a considerable amount of climbing.\nThe day started downhill and the racing\nbegan.\nThese are really fun moments, I'm told.\nSlowing down for the 50 km an hour speed\nlimit through the village\nand back up again to 80 km an hour.\nDangerous and noisy tunnels\nand back again onto quiet roads.\nKids, do not take your helmets off even\non uphills, especially on rough gravel.\nmore irresponsible descending.\nActually, this is controlled,\ncalculated, relatively cautious\ndescending by the guys, aware, as they\nhave been throughout, that to crash\nwould jeopardize the success of\neveryone's trip, not to mention hurt\nquite a bit.\nBoys will be boys, though, and they\nfound it hard not to push the limits\nevery now and then.\nThe Calderini, an opportunity for\nafternoon coffee and blueberry tarts.\nThe final descent to the overnight stop\nat Sbell.\nThe end of day six. And they are within\nspitting distance of me.\nCrossing the medieval Bon View on the\nfinal day.\nSurprise, surprise. It looks like they\nwill actually reach Nice.\nNot such a difficult day, but no\npushover. Still plenty of climbing right\nfrom the start.\nA closer look at the piers. A little\nfuller now because of the warm weather.\nA few last day vanity opportunities.\nThere was definitely the feeling that\nthey had done it.\nSome more gravel roads. And look at the\ntan on those legs. Or is it dirts?\nand much warmer weather as they\napproached the Mediterranean.\nA nice varied last day with two passes\nto climb on a combination of gravel and\ntarmac.\nOoh, careful on those blind bends.\nto the top of a very long hill\n&gt;&gt; onto the last climb.\nAnd there it was, the Mediterranean in\nthe distance.\nThe top of the K Damadon, the last climb\nof Turin Nice. More relief than pure joy\nby the look of it.\nThen the final race downhill to Nice.\ninto the outskirts of me.\ntraffic\nand palm trees.\n&gt;&gt; I love ice. Oh, sorry. I love niece.\nThis is my dad.\n&gt;&gt; That's my dad.\nAnd this is my dad.",
