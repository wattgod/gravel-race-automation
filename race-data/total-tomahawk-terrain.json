          "transcript": "Now, when it comes to bikes and metal\nframed bikes in particular, there's an\nendless debate over what material is the\nbest or more specifically which provides\nthe best ride feel. Now, unfortunately,\nthe discussion often devolves into\npointing out very specific properties of\nthe materials themselves. For instance,\nwhen discussing titanium versus steel,\nit is true that titanium has lower\ndensity, so it is lighter than steel for\nthe same volume of material. Titanium is\nalso much stronger than steel in tensile\nyield and shear, which is why you\ncommonly hear people reciting that\ntitanium strength to weight ratio is\nmuch higher than steel. Now, on the flip\nside, titanium is factually not as stiff\nas steel. In fact, it's only about half\nas stiff as steel, which is why titanium\nbike frames tend to have larger diameter\ntubes in order to compensate for the\nlower stiffness when compared to a\nskinny tube steel counterpart. Now, of\ncourse, these are generalized statements\nabout the material properties of\ntitanium and steel. And of course,\nthere's a whole slew of generalizations\nabout aluminum frames as well. Now, bike\nframes are never produced from pure\nelemental titanium or aluminum. And\nbelieve it or not, steel isn't even an\nelement on the periodic table. Rather,\nalloys or blends of elemental materials\nare used to produce titanium, steel, and\naluminum tubing used in frame building.\nAnd for each metal, there are different\navailable alloys, each with different\nmaterial properties. So the point is\nthat try as we might, it's really\nimpossible to make any generalized\nstatements about one material over the\nother. Anyone who claims that a bike\nframe made from one metal is always more\ncompliant or always stiffer or always\nlighter than another is simply not\nconsidering the whole picture. And in\naddition to the variation of alloys,\ntube diameters, and frame design from\nbike to bike, we haven't even mentioned\nthe butdding profiles of the individual\ntubes, which arguably have an equal, if\nnot bigger impact on the ride feel as\nthe material itself. Now, what is for\ncertain is that titanium is certainly\nmore challenging to work with, which\nwill increase production time. That\ncombined with the fact that titanium in\nits raw form is about a hundred times\nmore expensive than raw steel typically\nmakes a complete titanium frame\nsubstantially more expensive than a\nsteel counterpart. So, as promised in\nthe title, is splurging on a titanium\nframe actually worth it? Well, obviously\nno single video will hold a definitive\nanswer, but in this video I'll share my\nthoughts on titanium bikes based on my\nexperiences riding several of them over\nthe past few years. So, this is a Masi\nEncanto. It happens to be a titanium\ngravel bike that Bikes Online sent over\nfor review, and I've been riding it\naround for a few weeks now. Now, it's\nnot the first Thai bike that I've\ndemoed, and I'm sure it won't be the\nlast. But, as far as gravel bikes go,\nthis one is actually pretty par for the\ncourse. It's designed around 700c\nwheels, and the stock build comes with\n40mm wide Kenda aluvium semi-naviers. It\ncomes with a Stram Rival Explore Access\n12-speed one by drivetrain, 40 to chain\nring up front, and a 10 to 44 to\n12-speed cassette in the back. The\ngeometry is also pretty standard for an\nall-road gravel bike, if that's even a\nthing. Stack of 560, reach of 384 for\nthis size small, which is slightly\nlonger and lower than I'm used to, but\nit's comfortable nonetheless. It's got a\nsomewhat questionable head tube angle of\n71.8°,\nwhich seems oddly specific. The trail is\n68 mm, offering a balance of stability\nand agility. Short, relatively tucked\nchain stays at 425 mm and a BB drop of\n74 mm. So basically, geometrically\nspeaking, it's a very quote unquote\naverage gravel bike. Again, if that's\neven a thing. Nothing that stands out as\nodd. And it rides really predictably.\nNow, being a metal framed bike, it's not\na featherweight. And I have the weights\nfor a size small demo bike on screen\nright now without pedals. Now, very\nbriefly, some things that actually stand\nout on this bike. The fork is carbon,\nbut it does have a kind of unique shape\nto it. It kind of rakes out initially\nand then bends back down toward the\naxle. Almost resembles like a L fork,\nbut without the flexi bits. Also, the\nphotos online show a seat post with some\nsetback, but mine came with a straight\nseat post, which is likely just a\nfunction of this being a size small\nframe. And then, of course, the real\nhead turner are the handlebars. Now,\nthese are the coefficient gravel\nhandlebars. They're carbon and they're\nclaimed to be aerero optimized and\nthey're well they're just really weird.\nI think the idea is to create a top\nsection with a lot of back sweep for\nsome ergonomic benefits while not\naffecting the reach too much. Now\nthere's also convenient Garmin mount out\nfront and the bars are designed to be\nrun with internal cables. For me,\nhowever, this is just an example of\nengineering a solution to a problem that\ndidn't really exist and really creating\nsome other problems along the way. For\ninstance, the cable routing as a result\nof this handlebar design is pretty wild.\nThe brake lines are routed through the\nhandlebars, but they come out in these\nspots here, which actually makes the\ncable runs to the frame really awkward.\nNow, I do suppose you get that swept\nback top. And if that's something that\nyou really want, then this bar could\npotentially work for you. Although, it'd\nprobably work best with fully internal\ncable routing through the stem and the\nhead tube. Now, in my case, however, I\nsimply had to swap the bars after a\ncouple of rides. And I've been running\nan alloy Richie Butano bar and I've\nactually been much happier with the fit.\nI also swapped the saddle almost\nimmediately, but again, saddles are very\npersonal. It's just that the stock one\ndidn't work out for me. Okay, so other\nthan those few quirks, the bike actually\nrides really nice. And again, we're\ndiscussing whether titanium as a frame\nmaterial is worth the considerable\ninvestment. And so quirky component\nchoices on a complete bike are a little\nbit beside the point. All right, so\nlet's talk a little bit about ride\nquality. Now, I do have to say that this\nMSI rides very comfortably. It\ndefinitely feels lively and springy over\nrough terrain, very similar to some\nsteel bikes that I've ridden in the\npast. And if you'll pardon the verbiage,\nI would have to describe the ride as\ndamped, compliant, and muted over bumpy\nterrain. These are all things that I\nassociate with a comfortable ride.\nRather than pinging off rocks and roots,\nI almost felt as if I were sort of\nplowing over them with like a nice\nsatisfying thud. So, I'd say that I do\nfeel a difference in ride quality\nbetween this tie bike and an aluminum or\nsteel bike, but it is really subtle. I\nfelt the same way when I tested the\nBlackheart All-Road Tie and aluminum\nbikes back to back. Like, there is\ndefinitely a difference, but you really\nhave to focus your senses to feel it.\nAnd I also think that wide tires run at\nrelatively low pressures plays a really\nsignificant role in the ride feel,\nperhaps more so than the frame material\nitself. Even on this Masa here, a\ndifference between three or four PSI in\nthe tires actually makes a really big\ndifference in ride feel. Now, what makes\nit even more difficult to tease out any\ndifferences in ride field between metals\nis the fact that equivalent frames in\ndifferent metals can't actually exist.\nNow, what I mean by that is you could\nconceive of an experiment where you ride\na nice well-designed Thai gravel bike\nand then transfer all the components\nover to another frame made from, say,\nsteel, with everything being identical,\nincluding the geometry, the budding\nprofiles of the tubes, the tube\ndiameters, etc. Now, those two bikes\nwould ride so utterly differently, there\nwouldn't even be a comparison. The steel\nversion would be a tank, the tubes would\nbe entirely overbuilt, and it would\nprobably weigh a ton. Recall again that\nsteel is much stiffer than titanium. So\nyou can get away with running a much\nsmaller diameter tube for an\nequivalently stiff frame. So in other\nwords, again, it's just really hard to\nisolate the frame material between two\nframes of dissimilar metals. And\nultimately, I strongly believe that the\nframe design, as in geometry, budding\nprofile, tubing diameter has a lot\ngreater influence on the ride feel than\nthe material itself. Now, fortunately,\nthis MSI Encanto was designed in such a\nway that all the positive properties of\ntitanium do tend to stand out. Again, it\ndoes feel springy and lively, but I've\nalso ridden many bikes that have similar\nride characteristics that are not tie.\nFor instance, the Richie Outback has a\nsimilar ride feel with this budded steel\nlogic tubing, noting, of course, that\nthe tube diameters are substantially\nsmaller than on the Encanto. So, if I\nhad to make a generalized sweeping\nobservation about Tai frames, I might\nsay that when compared to steel, Tai has\na slightly, let's say, tighter feel to\nit. As in, it does tend to mute road\nbuzz, but in a slightly stiffer and less\ndamped way. Now, I have no data to back\nthis up, but of the handful of Thai\nbikes that I've ridden, I've generally\nfelt that they ride similar to steel,\nbut perhaps not quite as damped in how\nthey dissipate vibrational energy. Now,\nagain, this could easily just be a\nperceived property based on my own\nunique experiences. But nonetheless,\nwhat's generally always true is that the\ndifference in ride feel is always pretty\nsubtle. And again, with the trend of\nwider, squishier tires run at lower\npressures, those differences become even\nmore difficult to tease out. So, what\nwas the title of this video? Right. Are\ntitanium bikes and specifically Thai\ngravel bikes in this context worth it?\nWell, I said earlier that no single\nvideo is going to have a definitive\nanswer. But if you want titanium for the\nsake of the alleged improvement in ride\nfeel, as in buttery smooth, springy,\ndamped, muted, all those adjectives,\nthen I'll go ahead and say outright that\nno, the price jump to get on a nice tie\nframe is just not going to be worth it.\nI know it's a hot take, but I will be\nthe first to admit that ride feel isn't\neverything when it comes to selecting a\nframe material. People who invest in\ntitanium often do so knowing that a nice\nsteel counterpart would probably ride\nequally well and cost about half as\nmuch. But they go for the tie frame\nanyways for a number of other reasons.\nOne of which is that titanium is\nextremely corrosion resistant which is\nwhy most titanium bikes that you see are\njust a raw brushed finish. Steel on the\nother hand unless it's stainless is\nhighly susceptible to rust and other\ntypes of corrosion. Now, it's possible\nthat some people may believe that a\nhigh-end tie frame is somehow\nnecessarily lighter than a high-end\nsteel frame, but again, that's not\nactually true. Recall, because tie is\nnot as stiff as steel, larger diameter\ntubing has to be used to produce the\nsame overall stiffness. So, weight is\noften a wash between tie and steel. And\nthen, of course, the elephant in the\nroom, it could just be the bling factor.\nHaving a tie bike really does tend to\nset you apart from the crowd and lets\neverybody know that you're a committed,\nlifelong cyclist and that you're willing\nto drop big bucks on your gear. The\nvanity of it is something that we don't\nlike to admit, but deep down if you're a\ncyclist, you've got at least some amount\nof pride in the aesthetic of your bike.\nAnd buying a tie frame could just be\nsome kind of manifestation of that.\nAnyways, my answer to the question, are\nTai bikes worth it? Is going to be a\nlikely upsetting it depends. If you're\nlooking for pure ride feel, then no. Tai\nis definitely not going to be worth the\nprice. But there are plenty of other\nreasons that investing in titanium might\nbe worth it to you. Now, what I'd like\nto hear are your thoughts on titanium as\na frame material. Is it always worth it,\nor does it depend? What are the reasons\nbesides ride feel that you would opt to\nshell out for a tie frame? Let us know\ndown below. I'm legitimately curious to\nknow your thoughts. All right, well,\nthat's going to do it for this one.\nThanks again for watching and thanks for\nsubscribing to the channel if you\nhaven't already and we'll see you next",

first thing is I'm going\nto do a pre-wash of the bike with a\nand rinse it down this is to get all the\nloose dirt off it because if you start\ndoing a contact wash straight away what\nthat will do is mar the paint and rub\nthat dirt into the paint I see so many\nbike wash videos do this and it's a\nmassive mistake you would never do this\non your car and your bike well it can\ncost more than a car now if you have a\nstand it's really good to put your bike\nin a stand because that way you don't\nhave to do what I've just done there and\nspin it round you can work both sides on\nit easy and it stops IT falling over if\nyou don't have a stand place it up\nagainst a wall like I've done\nnow using a pressure washer is great but\nif you don't have a pressure washer just\na normal garden hose is fine the other\nthing oh the other thing that you want\nto do is make sure you don't pressure\nwash the bearings now we're going to put\nsome detergent in a bucket there we go\nnice squid of that and then J it up with\nour hose to get lots of\nbubbles now we're going to use this to\ndo the contact wash on the bike if\nyou've got a dedicated bike cleaning\nproduct that's really good that's what\nI've used look at that but you can use\nwashing up Liquid if you're in a pinch\njust be aware that if you do use washing\nup Liquid it is very good at stripping\nout grease from your bearings now while\nthat bucket's there filled I'm just\ngoing to put some degreaser on the\ncassette and on the Chain as I do this\nI'm going to back\npedal just so I get Degreaser all the\nway through the chain and I'm also going\nto put Degreaser on the Chain\nset now this one dedicated bike cleaning\nproduct I recommend that you invest in\nit is some proper deaser now while that\ndeaser is working its magic and then I'm\ngoing to go and do a contact wash on the\nrest of the frame now to do this you can\njust use a general uh sponge if you\ndon't have a wash mitt like this but\nwash mitts are far more effective at\nlifting the dirt off so we start at the\ntop of the bike and work our way\ndown\nperiodically rinsing it off in the\nbucket\nto the\nstays make sure you do all the way\naround the wheel\nrims you spin them around if you're in a\nrush and you're trying to do it in 5\nminutes you don't need to take your\nwheels\nout I'm just going to go on the down\ntube on the down tube you get loads of\ndirt\nthere just\nbehind behind the\nheadset so get it 3 minutes in b\nright we are 3 minutes down on the\ntimer so I better get a move on and stop\ntalking so\nmuch all right I got to do the other\nside of this\nwheel got all those Suds that's what you\nwant\nright now while those Suds just do their\nmagic before I rinse them off I'm going\nto get a brush loads of different\nbrushes available if you don't have a\nbrush like this you can use a\ntoothbrush but we're going to go in\nthere oh bucket Cam's moved\num and I'm just going to turn back pedal\nwith the\ncranks just\nto against that\none minute left a common mistake people\nmake is they use a brush like this on\nthe frame and the paint and that will\ndamage it so we're not going to do\nthat right just back of\nthere right time to rinse it\noff with our\nhose and we're nearly there we're nearly\nall done now this is a quick bike wash\nthis isn't the most thorough detailing\nsession you ever ever going to see but\nperiodically I'll do a deep clean\nhowever to keep me going in winter when\nI'm in a rush and just to make my parts\nlast longer this is exactly what I\ndo and it's really good all\nright what's the timer oh you got like 1\n4 minutes 45 four 15 seconds to spare\nthere you go I lied to you 4 minutes 45\nsecond bite wash done with the extra\ntime I'm going to dry off the frame with\na microfiber\ntow okay so with that done I just want\nto point out a few things and that is in\nprevious videos we've shown people using\nWD40 and or something like gt85 and as a\nDegreaser and as a lubricant I use WD40\nas my Degreaser this is terrible news\nthis is terrible news do not do this uh\none of the reasons is that you get\noverspray with products like that that\nwhich goes onto your brakes and ptft\nPTFE is in them that's a lubricant that\nwill cause your brakes not to work it's\nnot great on on uh Rim brake bikes but\nit is terrible on disc brake bikes and\nthat is because you'll contaminate your\nbraking services and your rotors which\nwill just make them scream and it's just\nterrible um so while on the subject of\nsaying you should invest in a good\nDegreaser uh something like this is\nparticularly good because uh it's not an\naerosol and it's also safe to use on\nyour disc Brak rotors it will actually\nclean this brake rotors um and not\ncontaminate them so something like that\nis absolutely ideal and once you have\ncleaned your bike it's also important to\nmake sure that it is dry so I've kind of\ncheated a bit in that I've not included\nthat in the 5 minutes but it's something\nthat's very quick just get like a towel\nor a rag if you don't have a nice\nmicrofiber drying towel just use an old\nrag or a t-shirt or something get that\nmoisture off and make sure you then\napply some lube to your chain so that it\ndoesn't go Rusty a lot of the time\npeople do a quick wash and then they\nChuck the bike in a shed they go off for\ntheir Sunday roast come back a couple of\ndays later and the Chain's all rusty so\nyou want to avoid doing that so they\nhave it if you're in a rush I hope this\nhas helped you and if it has then please\nuh subscribe as I can tell from our\nanalytics most of you don't and if you\nlook at this original video we did on\nthis subject here's sigh I use WD40 as\nmy deg Greaser you can see that we have\ncome a long way and your support really\ndoes help us make better videos love you\nbye",
