Late July in central Texas creates the heat challenge that defines this event more than the terrain. The 7:30 a.m. start acknowledges brutal summer conditions, but you're still finishing in Texas midday heat. Weather survival becomes part of the race equation. More weather exposure than Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

          "transcript": "How did tour to France riders climb up\nmountains so fast? The best pros can\naverage 25 km per hour or 15 mph up some\nof the most brutal climbs in the world?\nIs it just that they are fitter or is\nthere more to it? Before we get on to\nthe reasons why they're so fast, one of\nwhich I think is really going to\nsurprise you, we wanted to show you\nexactly how fast they are. We are midway\nup the Kodal Lamadon in southern France.\nThis is me riding at the power I can\nsustain for the entire 13 km climb which\nis about 280 W. And then this is me\nriding at the speed that threetime tour\nto France champion Ted Pagata was riding\nhere when he set the record on this\nclimb. It's quite a big difference.\n[Music]\nThe biggest determinant in climbing\nspeed is the power you produce versus\nthe weight of you and your equipment.\nThe more powerful you are and or the\nlighter you are, the faster you will go.\nThe best climbers in the tour front have\na very high sustainable power and they\ndon't weigh very much either. Currently,\na power to weight of almost 7 watts per\nkilo of body weight is needed to stick\nwith the very best in the key mountains.\nThey don't do it all on their own\nthough. Even on climbs, there will be a\nbenefit to sheltering from the air\nbehind teammates or other riders. For\nexample, the record speed at the C of\nGalibier held by Paga is 27 km/h despite\nthe 5 12% average gradients. At that\nspeed, drafting is still going to offer\na significant power saving versus riding\ninto the wind yourself.\nTo France riders will also pay close\nattention to their gears. Most will\nmaintain a high cadence of over 90\nrevolutions per minute. This allows them\nto respond easier to any accelerations\nin a group, but more importantly, it\nreduces the fatigue to the muscles. The\npower is the same, but torque is\nreduced. It's like doing more sets but\nwith less weight in the gym.\nCorrect pacing is another vital tool in\nmountains. Most amateurs will start\nclimbs way too fast and fade later.\nWhereas the best tour of France riders\nwill stay within their limits, allowing\nthem to attack later on. They often use\npower meters to gauge their efforts and\nthey know when to go fast and when to\ntake it easy. They also have an\nincredible ability to recover from very\nhard efforts whilst still climbing.\nOn shorter climbs, positioning going\ninto them can make a big difference as\nto how fast you go up them. Start at or\nnear the front and you'll be able to\ncarry your momentum from the flat. Start\ntoo far back and you might well find\nyourself having to slow down or even\nstop as the pelon tries to filter into a\nnarrower road.\nFueling strategy is a big consideration\nfor Tour to France cyclists. They will\nconsume up to 150 gram of carbohydrates\nper hour and they've trained their\nbodies to be able to absorb and use it.\nThis allows them to produce a similar\namount of power at the end of a long\ngruelling stage as they can when they're\nfresh at the start.\nSo those are the key points. But is\nthere anything less obvious that to\nFrance riders are using to climb faster?\nYes. Biomechanics.\nSome riders, including Tad Pagatcha, are\nnow pushing their saddle further\nforwards and tilting it slightly down so\nthat their knees are vertically over the\npedals when they're climbing gradients\nover 6%.\nThis can be described as pre-rotating,\neffectively meaning that their saddle is\nhorizontal whilst the bike is angled\nupwards with the gradient. The theory\ngoes that you get a better transfer of\npower in that position whilst reducing\npressure behind the bottom bracket. It\nmight not work for everyone, but it's\ncertainly something that riders have\nbeen experimenting with in recent times.\nSo, there you have it. The key\ningredient for tour France riders to go\nthat fast on mountains is a high\nsustainable power and a reasonably low\nweight. However, there is more that goes\ninto it than that. Not every rider with\nthe same power to weight ratio is able\nto go up to the front mountains at the\nsame speed. Hope you've enjoyed this\nvideo.

          "description": "The British cyclist tom pidcock is an incredible talent with incredible results. His bike handling skills are also among the best in the pro peloton. These skills have allowed him o win some of the biggest races in pro cycling. Now we are going to have a look at his 5 most impressive victories.\n\n1 alp duez \nPidcock used his incredible descending skills to bridge the gap to the breakaway on stage 12 of the tour de France. Then on the legendary climb  the Alp d’Huez he went solo dropping the likes of chris froome to take the stage win. He won on the legendary climb by 40 seconds joining the likes of Geraint Thomas as a British winner on Alp d’Huez\n\n2 Cyclocross world championships\nOnce again pidcock showed his supreme bike handling skills by winning the cyclocross world championships. He looked comfortable and calm throughout and won this title at the age of only 22 years old. He won with a huge gap and nobody seemed to be able to challenge him. \n\n3 Olympic mountain bike\nPidcock won gold at the Tokyo 2020 Oylimpics in the mountain bike race. He beat the best mountain bike riders in the world showing that he can dominate in all 3 of the disciplines he chooses. The Oylimpics which he stated as being ‘bigger than cycling’ is definitely a highlight in his palmares.\n\n4 Mountain bike world cup \nThe first time we saw pidcock prove himself in elite level mountain biking was at the world cup race in nove mesto in 2021. He rode to an impressive and dominant victory again with time to spare. He beat the likes of Mathieu van der poel. Pidcock once again proved his ability on the mountain bike winning the world cup race in nove mesto. He beat the likes of Mathieu van der Poel in this exciting race.\n\n5 La Flèche Brabançonne\nHe won the world tour classic La Flèche Brabançonne in exciting fashion after outsprinting Wout van Aert. Wout van Aert is a bigger rider with an impressive sprint so it was a very strong result from pidcock to be able to beat him to the line. This result also shows Pidcocks potential as a classics rider and we hope to see him contesting tour of flanders or liege bastonge liege one day",

years introducing and\nhelping gravel grow as a sport\nat the same time today's ride is a\nlittle bit over 40 miles which is on the\nshorter side of a grasshopper\nwhich is maybe why i chose it\nor maybe i just like saying maybe\nlet's roll\nwhen you ask how gravel is grown so\nquickly\na big part of that answer is miguel\ncrawford who's been a return guest\nof gbc live\nintroducing thousands to unique places\nto ride in northern california\ngaining the interest of pro riders\nfrom all disciplines of racing into the\nfold\nmaking the grasshoppers a one of a kind\nwhen we started these for 10 12 years\nthere weren't any other events like this\nis just what people did unless they were\nracing crossed or mountain bikes or\nroads so\nyou know you know like some people are\nstill going to use these early ones to\nget ready for the summer but like you\nknow it's accessible from the bay area\nand a lot of people could come up for\nthe day and so\nyou got mountain bikers you got road\nbikers you got the new gravel riders and\neverybody's just\ngel and it's just awesome yeah\nit's a big party\ni started with a group rod that was 10\nminutes from my house in occidental and\nthat's kind of how they started and now\nall of a sudden they're sold out like\nwhat i was supposed to be at team camp\nand then now i went to get in and it's\njust sold out so i had to text me and i\ncame in is there any way you can do me a\nfavor and let me in like now they're a\nhuge thing and i think they definitely\nhelp\nsonoma county cycling and the whole\ngravel scene as a whole they're pretty\nwell\nso known\ntoday gonna be fun or is it of course\nit's gonna be fun i mean riding bikes is\nfun that's why we do it i mean we're\nhere so everyone's a little nervous\nbecause you don't know what's gonna\nhappen\nand i think that this is a great way to\nhave it be a great training day but like\na little extra pressure\nyeah it's a lot one a month but uh i'm\nlooking for i'm looking forward to each\none's different they get a little bit\nlonger then we throw a mountain bike one\nin the middle then we have a couple\nreally big ones at the end so have that\nkind of fitness goal of people's for\npeople so\nlooking at the low gap route\nyour fitness goals better be high\nas it gets serious after the neutral\nrollout to the start\nthere's not a lot of time to warm up as\nyou launch into the steepest climb of\nthe day averaging 8\nover 3.8 miles\nwith a short reprieve followed with a\nlittle more climbing you'll soon hit\nyour highest speeds of the day\ndescending from the peak of or springs\nroad\nit's mainly flat the rest of the way on\npavement\npunctuated by a brief climb as you turn\noff road onto low gap with rollers the\nnext nine\nmiles just as the surface improves the\nmain climb on dirt may hit you hotter\nthan the one on the road averaging 7.7\npercent over three miles\nit's all downhill from here\nbut the last eight miles to the finish\nare challenging in a different way\nthe design does have a lot of holes some\nof them are like this big but you just\ndon't go in them so funny hop them\nor look really far ahead would be my\nbest\nadvice to anybody that ever comes here\nall in all these 43 miles with over 5700\nfeet of climbing\ndefinitely punch above their numbers\njust under a two hour drive north of the\ngolden gate bridge\nukiah sits as the county seat of\nmendocino\nnamed after the indigenous pomo meaning\nfor deep valley\neveryone was looking to stay warm\nas we rode out of ukiah high school\nwith temperatures still lingering around\n40 degrees\ngetting to the starting line early was\nnice\nbut it didn't take long till everyone\npacked it in\nand as me gave final instructions\nneedless to say\nit was a fast start\nas it was hard to stay together with a\ngroup of this size\nthe first couple of minutes went quick\nbut crossing over ackerman creek\nreally drop the hammer on putting your\nclimbing legs on\nthe grind is real\nwith the first mile graded as the\ntoughest\nand it felt strange having this much\nspace\nso much so that i thought it was\nhallucinating\noh never mind\nthe climb felt never-ending\nand it was hard to judge if there was\never a peak\nbut while the tree cover started\nblocking our views\nit did signal the end was near with\ngroups coming back together\ngotta catch back on when i can\nas i started to see some smiles as the\npitch let up\nhow are you doing so far\npretty raw\nwe're having fun don't worry i think\nit's probably the only hill of the day\nright yeah yeah\ni thought bikes were supposed to be fun\nand uh\nyeah we'll see how i feel\nwhat mile are we at\ni think 39 it's the downhill\nsprint don't worry\nnobody was buying my lies\nas this downhill reprieve lasted only a\ncouple of minutes\nand while we transitioned to climbing\ntowards the highest point of the day\nwe were at a pace friendly five percent\nallowing everyone to group back\ntogether with lauren cantwell graciously\nallowing me to get in the way while\nfilming\non her way to the podium\nnow if you're a big fan of science\nfor the next five miles\nyou'll have a lot of fun with newton's\nlaw\nbut remember to keep rotational kinetic\nenergy in check\nand while you're taking in the\nviews also keep in mind to stay to the\nright of the\nas this absence of the center on\ncreates some interesting angles\nattacking this\ndescent as the road flattens out we made\nour way into the redwoods\nand while we expected freezing temps\nstuck at the bottom of this tree canopy\neveryone continued to grind through\nwith people constantly adding to our\ngroup\nwe knocked off miles at a good clip\ntrying to keep up while fidgeting with\nmy rear camera to work\nbut coming across this little farmer-ish\npasture\nyou could ring the bell\nfor being the last opening we'd see for\na while\nthe shade unwelcomed us back\nto another 2k of paved climbing\nand seeing inaugural mountain bike hall\nof fame inductee jackie phelan crush it\nhelped move our legs\nthe pit stop signaled the turn onto low\ngap\nand while i got water and my camera\nrunning again\ni don't know if my eagerness to hit this\ndirt matched others\nseeing how i just chewed out my hand two\ndays ago\nit was tenuously using my shoulder as a\njoint from this two weeks earlier\nso maybe riding this dirt wouldn't put\nme in the good decisions hall of fame\nthe only thing with consistency over\nthis first nine miles of dirt\nwas its inconsistency\nat some parts people could just flow by\nto others navigating mighty ruts that\nthankfully weren't soggier\nwith also a lot of in-between of rocky\nbumpiness\nearly assessment\ndon't do this you just had a root canal\nthis is teeth chattering\nyou can see a lot more footprints the\ndeeper you went on low gap\nas the road started claiming people's\nliveliness\nin a number of ways\nand while there was help for the most\nsevere situations\nunfortunately the moto support got\npressed into duty\nand for all my fiddling with my rear\ncamera\nit ended with my battery cover coming\noff so\nthere goes another oscar\nthat didn't mean everyone wasn't rocking\nit\nas it was a beautiful day to be out\nand a good part of the downhill rollers\nwas fun\nbut passing this turn of the century\nhome\nsignaled that our last big uphill\nexploit had begun\nthe pitch was steep enough\nthat you were bordering on keeping a\ntempo\nmaking this effort the definition of a\nslog\noverturned vehicles\ndidn't instill confidence\nthat this was going to be a smooth\nexperience\nbut at least we hid some of the best\ndirt of the day on this portion\nwith no peak in sight\nyou just had to trust in the process\nthat you'd run out of atmosphere at some\npoint\nand the last feed zone signaled the top\nwas near\nas riders started emerging from the\ntrees\nas having views of open space felt like\na payoff\nright before the final phase begun\nthe descent started with two miles of\ntree cover\nand while you might call it bumpy\nit's smooth compared to later\nthe sunlight exposed the dried ruts\nmaking me envy the mountain bikes that\nwould pass\nbut the scenery helped make up for that\nthis hairpin felt like something esher\nwould draw\nbut it was all about letting it loose\nafter that\nand with my series of maladies and all\nmy body didn't feel as riveted as\nexpected\nand even gave a natural smile for the\ncameras\n[Applause]\ndropping your chain towards the bottom\nisn't preferred\nbut boy was i glad to see those stripes\nand i was not alone\nas the last kilometer breezed on by\nglad to not be sprinting the finish line\nbecause i don't know why\nhas the right to chill at the end wizard\neveryone packed into the park after\nand who wouldn't be happy\nas madfritz brewery\nwas a worthy reward\nalthough luke lamperti brendan witts and\nalex wilde on the men's side\nand kate courtney mod pharrell and\nlauren cantwell took home a bit more\nhardware than us\nso to make up for it on the ride back we\nmade our required pilgrimage\nto the new location of the russian river\nbrewing company\ntopping off our trip\nin proper fashion\nwell after all the hype i'm so glad to\nfinally get a grasshopper in\nlow gap even though it was 40 miles\nthere was a lot of punch that 5700 feet\nstill with the pace and everything\ninvolved\nstill feel like i've got room to ride\nthe descent sure\ni'll work on that next time but\ni'd love what grasshopper threw at us\nand i'll be back for more thanks meg\nif you want
