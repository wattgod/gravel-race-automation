        "explanation": "Southwest Nebraska is remote - McCook sits 284 miles from Omaha (4.5 hour drive). However, the tour handles camping, luggage transport between sites, and daily SAG support, reducing individual logistics burden. Sandy H. calls it \"one of the most enjoyable bike tours in the Midwest\" partly due to the seamless organization."
      },
      "length": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Daily distances of 35-59 miles are modest by gravel standards. The tour prioritizes accessibility with a \"no schedules, no deadlines\" philosophy and minimum 10 mph pace requirement. While the 5-day total exceeds 250 miles, per-day mileage fits in the recreational range rather than endurance athlete territory. More compact than Grinduro."

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Mostly maintained gravel roads suitable for various bike types. The optional gravel adventure includes single-lane minimum maintained roads (MMRs) and fresh gravel sections. Rosa Kloser noted \"Due to the SRAM Transmission system, I could push it in the mud without losing the derailleur\" during challenging sections, but routes remain intentionally accessible. Less technical than The Mid South."

The 2018 race saw 88°F temperatures with unexpected humidity levels. June is peak thunderstorm season with tornado risk and constant wind exposure on open plains. Similar climate challenges to SBT GRVL."

        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Southwest Nebraska sits around 2,500-3,000 feet elevation. No altitude acclimatization needed - sea level fitness transfers directly. This is pure Great Plains riding with no high-altitude factors affecting performance or preparation. Lower altitude than Gravel Worlds — no thin-air concerns."

        "explanation": "Registration costs undisclosed but multi-day supported tours typically run $300-500+. Food budget ~$250 additional for 5 days. The 284-mile drive from Omaha adds significant travel cost, though camping reduces lodging expense. Total weekend cost falls in moderate $500-1k range for supported touring.
