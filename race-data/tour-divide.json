Brett Simpson finished 14th in 20 days 21 hours, demonstrating the depth required even for mid-pack placement. Competition at the front is world-class. Even mid-pack finishers are serious athletes who have trained for months. Elite-level competition, on par with Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego. As JJJJustin puts it: \"As for the bike I don't think I could have built a better setup.

Flights to Banff, 2-4 weeks of resupply food, occasional hotels, and post-race travel home. Resort town stops are expensive. Total trip budget: $1,500-3,000+ depending on style.

It's not really comparable to other races; it's an expedition that happens to be timed. The combination of distance, elevation, terrain diversity, climate extremes, and complete self-reliance creates something unique in endurance sports. With only ~716 finishers in history and a 47-60% DNF rate, completing Tour Divide joins a very exclusive club.",
