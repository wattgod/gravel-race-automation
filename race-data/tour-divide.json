It's not really comparable to other races; it's an expedition that happens to be timed. The combination of distance, elevation, terrain diversity, climate extremes, and complete self-reliance creates something unique in endurance sports. With only ~716 finishers in history and a 47-60% DNF rate, completing Tour Divide joins a very exclusive club.",

Half of them fail anyway. Reasons: physical breakdown (feet swell, hands go numb, altitude sickness), mental defeat (alone for weeks, sleep-deprived, the doubts become overwhelming), mechanical failures beyond repair (you are 50+ miles from any bike shop), impassable weather (mud that stops all progress, snowstorms at 11,000 feet), fear (grizzly bears, lightning, exposure).

          "transcript": "[Music]\nThe shop here has kept us so busy. I\ndon't really have time to fish anymore.\n&gt;&gt; Bears, mountain lions, skunks.\n&gt;&gt; Fun patches. You ever seen a bear open a\nziplockc bag?\n&gt;&gt; Me neither.\n&gt;&gt; Phone in for bears.\n&gt;&gt; We've got snow.\n&gt;&gt; That dyke right there, that's a\ncontinental divide.\n&gt;&gt; Houston, we got a problem. We owe a huge\ndebt of gratitude to bicyclists from all\nover the world. I\n&gt;&gt; almost were crying cuz I was like this,\nI don't want this.\n&gt;&gt; Problems with your body, they they can't\nreally they can appear and I'm kind of\nscared of of coming across stuff that I\nsomehow can't really control. Last\nreapplication of shami butter.\n&gt;&gt; What's the plan? Where are we? What are\nwe doing?\n&gt;&gt; We're in B. Uh we are one day out of\ntour Divide 25. And uh the plan is to\nhopefully improve upon what I did in\n2023 here. And that was 15 days and 3\nhours. So, we'll see. Like I I really\nwould like to see a grizzly, but also I\nreally don't want to see a grizzly. So,\nit's it's quite quite um\na weird feeling towards these animals.\nUm yeah.\n&gt;&gt; What's so what's the goal for for this\nevent? What's what's your plan?\n&gt;&gt; So, plan is to\nor let's start differently. Um actually\nlike the record by now is 13 days and 2\nhours by Eustas.\nI know that that that um this is an\nambitious goal and I know that um it's\nyeah not easy to to to crack that FKT\nbut of course that's what I'm here for.\nI know that we need good weather. Um we\nprobably\nneed also\nor I need to make sure that there won't\nbe any any mechanicals and that kind of\nkind of stuff. and I need to be yeah in\na good good um mood and shape. Um but if\nthat is the case, I think I I can do it.\nMight see the boss. He's the sort of the\nbiggest most famous grizzly bear in B.\nSo maybe we'll bump into him. Last year\nI did see a grizzly on the first day,\nwhich is quite cool. Don't get many of\nthose in Sussex.\n&gt;&gt; The bears, you just have to be very wary\nof of of them all the time. You'll see\nelk, you'll see moose, you'll see tons\nof deer. uh coyotes. Uh as you get\nfurther down the route, you see\nanalopee, which is they're really cool.\nYou'll see uh I think in Wyoming I saw\nlike wild horses, which I didn't even\nthink was still a thing, but you'll see\nhorses ripping around.\n&gt;&gt; Last year I had a fully rigid setup.\nThis year I've got full suspension. So\nno particular reason, more just to try\nsomething different and see how see how\nit goes with with that sort of setup\ninstead.\n&gt;&gt; You got any advice for someone who's not\ndone it before?\nUm,\nrain trousers, but we just sorted that\nout. You got something, didn't you?\n&gt;&gt; Oh, crazy Larry. Uh, Tour Divide 2025.\nWelcome to the YWC. I want to wish\neverybody, uh, remember your ride is\npersonal and, uh, enjoy your ride and\neverybody have fun and phone in for\nbears. Phone in for 188866\nMTB Cast. Call me up. This is for bears.\nNervous, excited. Yeah. But looking\nforward looking forward to get moving.\n&gt;&gt; If you see a bear, grab your camera,\ntake a picture first.\n&gt;&gt; Uh we live in a pretty remote part of\nBritish Columbia, so we're quite used to\nthis this terrain for the first half\nanyway. So nothing that will catch me\ntoo off guard, but uh definitely big\ngrids are always, you know, as much as\nyou can get used to them, it's still not\na pleasant encounter no matter no matter\nwhat.\n&gt;&gt; 3 2 1\nWoo!\n[Applause]\n&gt;&gt; How are we feeling?\n&gt;&gt; Really good.\n&gt;&gt; Really excited.\n&gt;&gt; Woo!\n&gt;&gt; You've done this a few times. What are\nyou excited for? What's like the\nhighlights of your\n&gt;&gt; I'm just looking forward to just being\nout there.\nIt's the start of the tour divide.\nMexico are bust. Current bear count.\nCurrent bear count is zero.\nBut there's a good chance that number\nwill increase\nsoon.\n&gt;&gt; What is the tour divide? Where where are\nwe going?\n&gt;&gt; The tour divide is a off-road race\nself-supported from B\nAlberta, Canada to Anselope Wales on the\nMexican border. so much fun.\n&gt;&gt; Um 4,350k\nand yeah, this starts uh yeah, second\nFriday of every June\nHow's it going, man? It's going great.\nThis is uh something I've been waiting\nfor for a long time. Taking the trusty\nsingle speed out, ready to maybe make\nsome history on my buddy's bike.\nHeat. Hey, Heat.\nThis is so steep.\nHi. How's it going?\nYou got this.\nMy shoulders,\nmy knees,\nmy brain.\nBut we're having fun. Once this is done,\nit's like two little pushes and we're in\nfront.\nIt's it's really an absolute highlight I\nthink in every every ultra cyclist's\nlife like first time tour divide. So I'm\nreally excited to to spend a few days\nout in the wild and yeah find out how\nhow crossing these two countries looks\nlike.\nIt's the start of day two. I got to\nFernie last night.\nHad about 2 or 3 hours sleep. Keep the\nwarm clothes until you're well past the\nthe uh the Great Basin cuz there was\nsome cold nights. And um\nI don't know, maybe break it down into\nsegments, you know, just hit each state\nline, make make that as a boundary and\nuh reset at the end of one of those and\nthen chip away to break it down into\npieces and seems a bit more achievable,\nI think.\nDid you see many riders today? Quite a\nfew people.\n&gt;&gt; Uh yeah, a lot of people have passed me.\nI don't think I've passed a single\nperson.\n&gt;&gt; How's it going?\nThey're halfway through.\nIt's hard work. Someone's got to do it.\n&gt;&gt; I think it's like Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; 30 odd Kate\nleft of Canada.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. Give or take 20.\nSo cold.\nThere you go.\nYou got it.\nI think this is known as the wall.\nstaying in a bike hostel. Um, got my\nsleeping set up. I've got a bit of a\ncold, so um, and coughing up a bit of\nflem. I think just over overriding quite\na bit. So, um, I've opted to sleep\ninside. It says you can't sleep on the\nsofas, but I think I'll be fine on the\nfloor. Today was what like one of the\nhardest days I've had on a bike for for\na very long time. Um, the climb,\nthe hiker bike, the wall was brutal. And\nit wasn't just the\nlike the pushing the really really steep\nbit. It was kind of a really long drag\nafter it and that just kind of broke me.\nAnd\nyeah, it was a bit of um stopping and\ndrinking water and just grling to the\nfinish.\nUm well, I finish is a very vague way of\nputting it.\nWe're not even anywhere near the finish.\nI've set my alarm for 4:00 a.m. It's\ncurrently um half 11, so 4 and a half\nhours sleep. And then we we go again. Uh\nanother push and into some uh grizzly\nbear territory. There was some some\nwolves howling out there. So, lots of\nwildlife.\nIt's day three now. Heading into\npretty heavily grizzly bear populated\narea.\nGoing towards\nwhite fish.\nWhat's your plan today, Liam?\n&gt;&gt; Got somewhere booked. 100k up the road.\ngot some signs out for everybody. Go\nTour Divide and uh I saw you on uh what\nwas it? Instagram and so I thought I'd\nput your sign out there for you.\n&gt;&gt; I've just come two miles off route to a\nplace called Big Fork and I'm now in a\nmotel. I've got a bit of a sore throat,\nso I wanted to make sure I'm looking\nafter myself. It's a long way to go\nstill. And um yeah, just see if I can\nfix that.\nAnd I didn't want to push into 100 miles\nof nothing.\nGot some coins.\nJust taking all my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] money and not\ngiving me any porridge.\nTake a nice Have a nice day. Yeah. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]\nyou.\n&gt;&gt; You had a good day then?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, not bad.\nWe're well ahead of the 20-day dot, but\nthe thing is that that bastard never\nsleeps. Just keeps moving at an average\nspeed\nall throughout the night. So, we'll wake\nup tomorrow. It'll be a lot closer than\nit is now.\nThat's why I got this. Keep me going.\nSleep well. See you tomorrow.\n&gt;&gt; No bears yet.\nMorning.\n&gt;&gt; Morning.\nWhat's a bear count, Liam?\n&gt;&gt; One bear,\nblack bear\nbouncing around the road in front of us.\nNot now, but immediately\nI'm like ice cream\nslurpee\nsmoothie.\nThis is a mess, isn't it? Okay.\nOh.\nWhat day is it? National Cougar Day\ntoday. Oh no, sorry. It's supposed to be\n4 days ago. It was National Cougar Day 4\ndays ago.\nstickers on the first day and this\nmorning when I was waking up I like\ntouched myself and I was like\n&gt;&gt; this is what it looks like before I get\neaten by a bear.\n&gt;&gt; Why would you get eaten by a bear?\nHi, I'm Kathy Thurman. A lot of people\nknow me as Kathy Shondorfer, but I got\nmarried two years ago. And uh welcome to\nAando, Montana. And uh you're at the\nBlackfoot Angller. and I am basically\nthe intermediary between the town and\nthe cyclists and social media for bike\npacking and the tour divide and I take\nall of your pictures.\n&gt;&gt; What's special about Oando?\n&gt;&gt; Well, there's what is special about\nOando? That is a very good question. Uh\nwe're very small population 75 on a good\nyear and we became cycle friendly oh\nprobably about 10 years ago and so we\nput up a teepee in a sheep wagon brought\nthe jail in and allowed the cyclist to\ncome in at any time of the night or the\nday up until October and they can stay\nhere and they've can get breakfast and\nthey can get dinner and they can take a\nshower and uh see a little bit of the\ncountryside because outside of town\nright behind me. It's nothing but ranch\nland. Literally, we have cycling to\nthank for make putting Oando on the map\ncuz 20 years ago, nobody even knew we\nexisted in the state of Montana. And\nthen we became cycle friendly and you\nguys all came and we got nominated\nbecause of cycling for the 2018 Montana\nState Community of the Year in\nRecreation and Tourism.\nAnd we won. And nobody size of this town\nhas ever won that prestigious award. And\nit wasn't because of fly fishing. It\nwasn't because we're nice people. It was\nbecause of cycling and everybody that\nvoted for us in the cycling community\nand told the tourist board about it. So\nwe owe a huge debt of gratitude to\nbicyclists from all over the world.\n&gt;&gt; I've just left Aando\nso heading towards Lincoln.\nA good good stay in a teepee last night.\nWhat we got today on the menu? Oh, we\nare going to do a couple nice peaks into\nHelena. I think we have three climbs\nbefore we get there. They're only a\nlight red on the Garmin. So, not too\nbad. And then we'll be ending the\nevening in Helena. There's a Hardies in\nmy future, which I've never tried\nbefore. So,\n&gt;&gt; what's that?\n&gt;&gt; I don't know. I think it's an American\nburger brand. So, we're going to find\nout this evening. But otherwise, we're\nfeeling good.\n&gt;&gt; What's after Helena? What\n&gt;&gt; What Mario Kart themed thing we got\nafter?\n&gt;&gt; Oh, the lava mountain. I don't think I'd\nbe choosing that if I were a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]\nMario Kart, that's for sure.\n&gt;&gt; So, we just came out of Lincoln climbing\nup uh Stemple Pass, and I'm not sure the\nexact location, but the Uni Bomber, and\nI think this was back in the '9s, early\n'90s, uh a famous infamous uh American\nserial killer. I don't I think he killed\npeople. I have no facts straight, but uh\nhis cabin was up here and he didn't have\nrunning water or electricity and we just\nlike put together these bombs and mail\nthem out. Uh and then his brother ended\nup uh turning them in. We just rode by\nhis cabin. Uh Ted Kazinski,\nthe uniomber.\n&gt;&gt; Everyone like you know.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; My name is Barbara and I and uh our\nplace is known as the alpaca farm.\nAnd uh we host cyclists that ride in. We\nhave five cabins and a sheep herders\nwagon. You okay?\n&gt;&gt; Oh, watch out for those.\nMera and I are riding the tour divide\ndog packing style\njust like everyone else except that I\nhave a a furry bundle of love\nwith me. Yeah. Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So, you've got a friend the whole way\nwhole way around.\n&gt;&gt; I do. Yeah. She's pretty good actually.\nShe uh on the steep climbs like Stumple\nPass here, she jumps out and walks\nbeside me and uh helps out cuz she\nweighs 20 plus kilos, 40 some odd pounds\nand then with her food and all that kind\nof stuff. So, it's nice to be able to\nunload that and then um yeah, I have her\nat night and then get to see people, you\nknow, meet her and they all brighten up\nand and that's really nice, too. That's\nthat's one of the best parts.\n&gt;&gt; How's your ride going so far?\n&gt;&gt; I think pretty good. Yeah. Um the main\nthing for me is is trying to find that\nbalance between distance and long days\ncuz we all want to you know do our best\ntime\n&gt;&gt; but I can't uh you know sort of abuse me\nright like\n&gt;&gt; like on the climb she's out and she's\nwalking in that in and out and the\ngravel. So the first days it's a lot of\nrolling terrain and that's really hard\non her paws the jumping in and out and I\ngive her a bit of a tug with the leash.\nSo, I um help her into the basket and\nand I lessen the impact, but uh it's\nstill a lot. So, yeah, I think we found\na good middle ground. So, it's it's\ngood. She wakes up in the morning, she's\nkeen to go. That's the that's my key\nsignal. They're doing okay. I just want\nto make sure that we don't prevent the\nbefore tree.\n&gt;&gt; Barbara's been here since 1989\nand the ACA defined the route in '98.\nSo, Barbara has been here since the\nbeginning.\n&gt;&gt; Wow. And so, you know, essentially the\nway that this became what it is now is\npeople would stop in and ask if they\ncould get water, you know, if they could\npitch a tent. And Barbara finally\nfigured out that she was on the GDMVR.\nAnd uh she bought that cabin down there.\nI don't know if you've seen it yet. And\nuh that started the whole thing. I\njoined 9 years ago and we've been adding\naccommodations ever since. We currently\nhave 15 beds. So the one thing that's\nreally neat about our place is that we\ndon't charge anything and uh all we ask\nin return for the people that stay with\nus is that they pay that forward. So\nthat we ask that they spread love and\nkindness through the world after\nexperiencing the love and kindness in\nour 4 acres here. Um so we don't take\nany donations. We just hope that the\nworld will become a better place for\nthose people that stay with us.\nOh. Oh,\nIt's day seven of the tour divide.\nI've gotten up early\nto get some riding in before the heat.\nIt's a beautiful morning.\nWhat we got coming up?\n&gt;&gt; One of the most flat sections of the\nentire route\n&gt;&gt; from Alorn Springs all the way through\nthe rest of Montana into Idaho.\nWe're on the Banic Road in a headwind.\nI've arrived at the world's creepiest\nmotel room. Um, we opened the door and\nthe curtain was just blowing into the\nroom and um, yeah, as if there was a\nghost or something.\nBut huge day today. cycle from but to um\nwherever we are now. I'm too tired to\nlemur. Um we're in Lemur. Um and this\nwas the last motel room. So um we had to\nI've got a share with Justin. Um he's\nnow having a shower.\nUm\nyeah, big day over well just over 300k.\nSo just shy of 200 miles.\nSo able to catch up a little bit on um\nthe 20 20day dot. I think it just left\ntown as we were entering. Oh yeah. Go\nagain tomorrow.\n&gt;&gt; Good morning.\n&gt;&gt; Hey, good morning.\n&gt;&gt; Just trying to survive today. So, either\nIsland Park or um\nuh the Squirrel Creek Ranch today and\nthen just do a 100 miles to that cuz I\nwant to get from there through Pinedale.\nI've heard that's where they put the\nproblem bears.\n&gt;&gt; What?\n&gt;&gt; The like bears that uh like break into\npeople's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] but they don't want to\nkill. They relocate them to the stretch\nbetween like Tagitty or Tigodi or\nhowever you say it pass and Pinedale.\n&gt;&gt; Is that true? I the I was explicitly\ntold by somebody who when I asked him\nwhat he does for bears, he said he no he\nsaid I do nothing. He's like I sleep\nwith food in my tent. I just am smart\nabout where to sleep. He explicitly told\nme do not sleep outside between those\ntwo places.\nIt's the start of day eight\nand what was meant to be\nbit of a tailwind\nhas flipped and is now a headwind.\nMy knees are pretty sore from the big\npush yesterday.\nI just feel a bit fatigued.\ncan feel pretty pretty fortunate that\nit's not raining.\nThis wind is not nice.\nWe're no longer in Montana. We've just\ncrossed into Idaho.\nSo, done with the big state.\nI was eating a beef stick and these cows\nwere looking at me and I was like,\n\"Sorry guys,\n&gt;&gt; it might flurry here tonight, but uh\nyeah, that's that's the weather report.\"\n&gt;&gt; So, we've kind of missed most of it.\n&gt;&gt; You're you're lucking out. You guys hit\nit about perfect.\n&gt;&gt; So, it's perhaps more central than I\nwanted it to be.\n&gt;&gt; I want chocolate milk. I want chocolate\nmilk. Where's chocolate milk?\n&gt;&gt; We're just going to get out of here.\n&gt;&gt; Decisions, huh?\n&gt;&gt; We're going to get at the gas station,\nso I don't care.\n&gt;&gt; That's big brain thinking.\n&gt;&gt; What popcorn option are we getting?\n&gt;&gt; Okay. The size was like the size of my\ntorso.\n&gt;&gt; Are you small?\n&gt;&gt; For tonight, I'm just going to eat this.\n&gt;&gt; I was I was thinking for the lake.\n&gt;&gt; For the cabin with the fireplace, we\nshould get a box of wine.\nCome on.\nUh, not bad. I was kind of hoping.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. Turn around.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, so on rider GPS, this whole\nthing is\n&gt;&gt; Are we racing?\n[Laughter]\n&gt;&gt; I love this style of racing. I love\nracing.\nAmerican\ndelicacy.\n&gt;&gt; Only the finest things in America. Have\nthey added vitamins to this as well?\n&gt;&gt; I'm sure.\n&gt;&gt; It's like a PB&amp;J.\n&gt;&gt; It is what it is.\n&gt;&gt; That's a PB&amp;.\n&gt;&gt; You're right. It's technically a PB&amp;H.\n&gt;&gt; Oh,\n&gt;&gt; this hits so good. It's like the peanut\nbutter is a little cold, so it freezes\nyour a little bit when you bite it, but\nthen the honey kicks in. Delicious.\nCheers.\n&gt;&gt; How far have we got to go? only\n50 kilometers, which I've been informed\nis 30 miles and 700 meters of climbing.\nGod knows what that is in feet. We'll\nget there to our fireplace and our\nslumber party.\n&gt;&gt; Dude, we had a day. Uh,\n&gt;&gt; did we have a day? We\n&gt;&gt; I It wasn't bad necessarily.\n&gt;&gt; Is it weird that I'm naked?\n&gt;&gt; Pretty crazy that it's end of\n&gt;&gt; June.\n&gt;&gt; Happy solstice, baby. Pretty crazy that\nwe've had hot weather the whole time and\npretty crazy that there's this much\nsnow.\nThat's my thoughts.\n&gt;&gt; And so this way we won't be wet. We'll\njust have snow hitting our face.\n&gt;&gt; That's actually very true.\n&gt;&gt; And either way it's going to be a muddy\nsoupy mat. So at least we're not wet and\nmuddy. We're just muddy.\n&gt;&gt; It looks very scenic. We've got all my\nlayers on.\nHow are we feeling?\n&gt;&gt; You know,\n&gt;&gt; it's cold. It's snowed a lot overnight.\nWell, only an inch, but still not ideal\nwhen we have to go over reunion up\nhigher. And now we're trying to eat\nbreakfast and prep our spirits. But it's\nlooking a little bleak.\n&gt;&gt; Uh avoid hypothermia. And that's by\ndoing this.\n&gt;&gt; I don't know if that helps. It's not\nraining, you know, so I'm not wet.\n&gt;&gt; I am not thrilled.\nHow much we got to do today? like 180\nkm.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\nAnd where are we stopping?\nWhat is it? Pinedale.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think so.\n&gt;&gt; Okay. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] This is going to be a hard\n180.\n&gt;&gt; Day 10 and we've got snow.\nI guess the fun starts now, huh?\n&gt;&gt; But yeah, this is pretty [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]\nA nice Sunday stroll. And it's Sunday.\nPerfect. Good.\nEmergency satellite phone. Dude, you got\neverything.\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\nOkay, I hear this is your third. Go with\nthis.\n[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] yeah, dude. I want you to finish so\nbad.\nLike I might want you to finish what I\nwant for me.\nWhat may I ask? What happened? Like\nwhere where you had to scratch last two\ntimes? If you don't want to talk, you\ndon't have to. The first time\nI don't think I ever really thought I\nwas going to finish. I just kind of\nwanted to see what it was.\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; And then\nI scratched my pond.\n&gt;&gt; Oh my. I didn't have my pants on and my\nknee was like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and I was in so\nmuch pain and I like almost crying cuz I\nwas like this I don't want this. Like\nyou don't want these things to happen.\nIt's just like so painful.\n&gt;&gt; Um but then of course you put your pants\non and you're like oh I'm working\neverything's good. We're fine. So, it's\njust like I don't know. It's just I\nalways I always say poco poco. It's like\nbit by bit, you know,\n&gt;&gt; one thing at a time. Um,\n&gt;&gt; and it all passes. It always does. It's\njust kind of like knowing where the line\nis and not pushing it too hard. So, but\nI want it too badly,\nbut we'll see.\nWe'll see. I have some flaws.\n&gt;&gt; Uh, so how's your dish now? Feeling my\nthe machine, the performance machine\nthat is my body. Usually without having\ndone any exercise\nnow. Heading\ndownhill towards Pinedale.\nThe skies have opened up a bit. There's\nless mountains around.\nWe're heading down into the basin\ntomorrow.\nSome big riding hopefully if we get a\ntailwind. Not so much. If we get a\nheadwind,\nhe was very excited.\n&gt;&gt; Couple weeks. Oh my god. Trying at 27\nyears.\n&gt;&gt; You had a good day.\n&gt;&gt; I had an okay day. I woke up very\ncomfortable in all the beds and I looked\nout the window and thought, \"Oh, look.\nIt's morning.\" I noticed that there was\nsnow everywhere.\nSo that was unwelcome. We experienced\npain for the first time. Also unwelcome.\nUm it was really cold. I think we wore\nall of our layers. And then the descent\nwasn't really a descent. And we didn't\nreally get the gratifying like flying\ndown the mountain that we usually do.\nBut it's okay. We made it. And now we're\neating a 2-hour old burger in a lobby\nand drinking a giant gallon of almond\nmilk. So could be worse.\nAnother\ncold morning on the tour divide.\nI'm currently cycling\nin the basin, which is the flattest part\nof the route,\nI suppose, before you get to to New\nMexico. How's it going?\n&gt;&gt; Good.\nHappy that we won't have any climbs\ntoday.\nMy legs hurt and happy to have some\ncompany.\nHeat.\nI missed an opportunity back there to\ntell that man and he asked me why I was\nstill carrying my bear spray. Because\nwe're out of bear to bear territory that\nuh bears don't respect the lines we've\ndrawn on maps.\nThey don't recognize them. Bears very\nindependent thinkers.\n&gt;&gt; And here you are with our bear spray.\n&gt;&gt; What's special about your Ziploc bag?\n&gt;&gt; Oh, this one. Well, one, for one, it's\npatented, so you know it's legit. Up to\nuh 200 feet or 60 m for you uh anyone\nwho's not American. Um, but it is\nbearproof.\n&gt;&gt; Why is it bearproof?\n&gt;&gt; You ever seen a bear open a Ziploc bag?\n&gt;&gt; You can't prove that it isn't. And now\nwe're out of bear torto. We have no\nbears.\n&gt;&gt; There's definitely black bears further\nup.\n&gt;&gt; Black bear is not very smart.\nEverybody knows that. That's why you\ndon't need bear spray.\n&gt;&gt; You just say, \"I don't taste good.\" And\nthey go away.\nWhat do you think of this?\n&gt;&gt; It's um a very American mindset.\n&gt;&gt; We don't think that way. I will be\npopping my bear spray at the finish like\nchampagne away from the direction of my\neyeballs.\n&gt;&gt; In that case, I hope we don't feel\nHeat. Heat.\nOh no.\n&gt;&gt; I feel like I should down this because I\nhave no salt in my body.\nYeah. Oh no, my little hand. Okay.\nMm-m.\n&gt;&gt; You happy to be here?\n&gt;&gt; So happy to be here. I'm going to\nprobably walk out with my pockets more\nfull than I need to be because I'm just\njoyous. Look at all this stuff.\n&gt;&gt; How's your bike ride going?\n&gt;&gt; It's hot today.\n&gt;&gt; Is it?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. Real like what?\n&gt;&gt; Hot and windy.\n&gt;&gt; Which direction are you going?\n&gt;&gt; South.\n&gt;&gt; No. Weather eye check said it was going\nto be 95.\n&gt;&gt; No. And then was it yesterday morning or\nthe morning before that woke up to snow?\nYesterday morning.\n&gt;&gt; Where at? Yesterday morning at my house\nit was 30\n&gt;&gt; towy. I don't know how you say to toy\n&gt;&gt; Cody outside of Jackson.\n&gt;&gt; and it\n&gt;&gt; up there in the mountain.\n&gt;&gt; Mhm.\n&gt;&gt; No bueno.\n&gt;&gt; Uh-uh.\n&gt;&gt; But yeah,\n&gt;&gt; vitamins.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, look at that.\n&gt;&gt; No sugar added.\n&gt;&gt; We're somewhere in like the 21 to 24 day\nwindow.\n&gt;&gt; Oh my god. I've actually been doing math\nof how many more like\n&gt;&gt; how many miles a day is that?\n&gt;&gt; Quite a few.\n&gt;&gt; It's like in the 120ish.\n&gt;&gt; Oh wow.\n&gt;&gt; range.\n&gt;&gt; Well, do you have any meat on your\nbones?\n&gt;&gt; I know you've lost a lot. I don't know\nabout you guys, but I've lost a lot of\nweight for sure. Yeah. Not enough.\n&gt;&gt; I should probably go for I don't know,\nfive or six days.\n&gt;&gt; Go for 22.\nWell, the problem is you just get\ninsanely hungry and then you eat\neverything and you don't actually lose\nany weight at the end of it.\n&gt;&gt; Most people say in like the two weeks\nafter they're heavier than when they\nstarted\n&gt;&gt; you got to be careful to stay hydrated\n&gt;&gt; in this kind of weather. Boy.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. It catches up to you real quick.\n&gt;&gt; Do you want a spoon? There's spoons in\nthe kitchen.\n&gt;&gt; Nope.\n&gt;&gt; You don't?\n&gt;&gt; Nope. Cool.\n&gt;&gt; It's too late.\nGood to see you.\n&gt;&gt; Your hair smells so good,\n&gt;&gt; dude. It's real shampoo in there.\n&gt;&gt; I can't wait till my hair\n&gt;&gt; Yours is going to be just as luscious\nshortly.\nWhat's special about this area? Where\nare we? We are in Stage Coach, um, Oak\nCreek, Colorado. It's just a really nice\ncommunity, an environment to, um, I\nraised all three of my boys here with no\nregrets. What do you do for work?\n&gt;&gt; I work for Morrison Creek Water and\nSanitation. I've been there for 22\nyears. Um I also own a um property um\nmanagement company. So we do snow\nremoval and all types of um property\nmaintenance. Again have I drive this\nroad probably more than anybody. And I\nsee you guys biking and I was a Norba\nmountain bike racer. I love outdoor\nsports and I see what you guys are\ndoing. if like if there's anything I\ncould do to support your endeavor going\nfrom Canada to Mexico is insane and\nawesome that if I can support that and\nhelp that that's why I'm here. That's\nwhy I stopped and turned actually I\ndrove by you guys turned around and just\nlet you know that if there's anything I\ncan do to help cuz this is the type of\nworld I want to live in.\nI'm currently about 2k off the route of\nthe tour divide\nnext to the Colorado River in some hot\nsprings\nwith incredible stars.\nAfter a 200k bike ride, I'm tired.\nBut this this is magical.\nReady to continue cycling to Mexico\nI am the happiest person with money.\nThis is maybe the best supply I've come\nacross. Like just more in terms of\nsurprise. And they had a legitimate sign\nlike this and I was like there's not\ngoing to be anything there. And then\nlook, we found gold at the end of the\nrainbow.\nWe came across a surprise little trail\nangel in where are we right now?\nWilliams for Chris War.\n&gt;&gt; There was a sign a couple miles back\nthat said to divide support and we kind\nof thought probably nothing.\nI've just found Josh in the middle of\nColorado and surprised him on on his\ntour divide exploits. Um, don't think he\nwas expecting to see uh to see me rock\nup halfway up his halfway up his climb\n&gt;&gt; I wasn't. It was a lovely surprise.\n&gt;&gt; Smashing it 2/3 of the way through\nroughly. It's pretty good. Pretty epic.\nOnly a week left.\nThis is insane.\n&gt;&gt; Sliced pears.\nWe've been very fortunate that the uh\npost office is open in Komo, Colorado,\nand we're able to sleep inside tonight.\n&gt;&gt; I'm assuming this is a bear pelt. I\ndon't know. I don't want to know what\nanimal this is.\n&gt;&gt; Tip.\n&gt;&gt; Tip. Tip for what?\n&gt;&gt; Do you not have that in Canada?\n&gt;&gt; No. like tip is like um rubbish.\n&gt;&gt; it's like a bit of a mess.\n&gt;&gt; I would call this a yard sale in Canada.\nWe've exploded everywhere.\nFree frazzle on a Friday.\n&gt;&gt; I have a brain freeze. It's a horrible\nfeeling.\nWe made it. And I didn't fall asleep on\nthe bike.\nI'm having a great time. I am going to\nbe a stronger person when I get done\nwith this. Life will be so easy.\nDisappointments. No.\nLike struggle, no. If you guys want\ndifferent hair, you can't do it. I got\nmy cold hair. I could put hot hair on. I\ncould have no hair.\nThis is like a convertible. Hope there's\nno leeches in that\n&gt;&gt; cuz there's a laundry mat across the\nway. But I got to, you know, figure out\nfigure out like all this logistics by\njust going to go there and order pizza.\nYeah, pizza sounds good.\nI came rip down after coming out of the\nsandy section and saw this really cool\nsign and I was like, \"Oh, cool. I'm\ngoing to put my bike against it.\" And\nthen I looked down. I'm like, \"Ah,\nthere's an aid station. I'm going to\ngrab a Gatorade.\" And then I looked down\nagain and there's a snake coil next to\nthe Gatorade. So, I don't think this\ngirl's getting any Gatorade today.\nkilling it.\n&gt;&gt; Wow, you're still smiling, too.\n&gt;&gt; You guys left Bamp, right?\n&gt;&gt; I'm running it together.\n&gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; They say ultras are about multitasking.\nSo, I am eating my dinner. I have\nfreshly taken a shower and I'm going to\ngo do my laundry. I'm also sporting a\nwonderful hotel robe and these Shimano\nshoes. Laundry time. It's nice to be out\nat cycling kit. It's very breezy down\nhere.\nAfter you.\n$20. The laundromat was eating all of\nour coins. So now we're going further\ninto the public in our get up to buy\nsome laundry detergent. Just this could\nbe fun. That could be Gatorade. That's\nwhat I'll fill it with. No, the frazzle.\nOkay. Detergent.\nThe uh Tide Simply All-in-One laundry\ndetergent. Do you think Robin got his\nrobes and was looking around the\nsupermarket for Tide? Hopefully, our\ncycling kit hasn't been nicked because\notherwise we're cycling the rest of the\nway to Mexico in these robes. Oh, it's\nso warm in here.\nAh, our cycling kit is still there.\nscratched because we like left our\nlaundry our clothes in the laundromat\nand it got nicked.\n&gt;&gt; No one's going to seal this. It's toxic.\n&gt;&gt; Cycle temperature. Add supplies.\nSupplies. Where do you add the supplies?\n&gt;&gt; Oh, up here. Okay. Okay.\nOh, there's a big fly in there. Ew.\n&gt;&gt; Half.\nPush start. 23 minutes. Even better.\nIt's day 17 of the tour divide. And\ntoday we're heading up Indiana Pass,\nwhich is the highest pass on the tour\ndivide.\nBaby,\nbaby.\nColorado is not letting us out without a\nfight. He's throwing some more washboard\nour way,\nwhich is delightful.\nWe're in Orca, Colorado. Uh it's one of\nthe most beautiful areas in the in the\nstate of Colorado. And uh people that\ncome here from all over the United\nStates\nuh have nicknamed it Little Alaska\nbecause it's terrain is so much like the\nAlaska terrain.\n&gt;&gt; So the Amish pie is behind you. the the\nAmishuh community makes those and uh\npeople that come in from all over the\nworld come to eat these pies because\nthey say they've eaten pie fried pies\nall over the world and none can compare\nto these\nin New Mexico. Woo!\nHeat up here.\nWe all kind of camped in the same area\nlast night at about\njust before 1:00 in the morning and\nwe're on the Continental Divide Trail,\nwhich is basically a walking path.\n&gt;&gt; It's all right.\n&gt;&gt; I just take like a handful of instant\ncoffee, just throw it in there, rinse it\ndown. What do you do?\nHouston, we got a problem.\n&gt;&gt; Wiggle, wiggle,\n&gt;&gt; cuz you know you're not going to be\neating too good. So, I was taking like\nLet's see if I can find it. I was taking\nlike little packages of instant um\ncoffee and then topping it off with\ndaily greens and then slamming it, but I\nalmost choked to death. Um\nuh yeah, it wasn't good. And I was kind\nof out in the middle of nowhere and this\nguy pulled up and he's like, \"What are\nyou doing?\" because I was coughing these\ndaily greens out of my mouth. Um,\nhow do you search for videos?\nOh, that's special.\nI guess I'm going to be I'm going to I'm\ngoing to get like some of those kids\nsunglasses, you know, like with the\nlittle bunny rabbits or something on\nthem.\n&gt;&gt; Gas station.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the gas station sunglasses instead\nof these prescription Oakleys.\n&gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. They're broken.\n&gt;&gt; Prescription Oakleys. They're expensive.\nThey are expensive. They were expensive.\nI I'll actually I'll give them to you\ndiscounted half price.\n&gt;&gt; This is so stupid. Like look, it's\nshitty there. Then it gets shitty over\nthere. Then there's roots. And then\nright when at the top is just more [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]\nJust gone through the first town\non the route in New Mexico.\nAnd it reminds me very much of Serbia.\nSome of the brick work,\nvery rundown in places.\nThen oddly, some of the houses have\nTeslas and Mustangs just outside like\nalmost derelict looking house. Who would\nhave thunk it? Grab waterproof trousers\nand capless cyclists winter gloves in\nNew Mexico.\nWild.\nSo, I'm now climbing\nup\nprobably the the last longest climb of\nthe the tour divide.\nMade it to the top of the last 3,000\nmeter pass. So now it's a bit of a roll,\nbut then downhill towards Cuba.\nJust passed through Cuba.\nYou can see behind me, it's some pretty\ndark clouds. We're kind of on the edge.\nBlue skies ahead. We're out running the\nstorm. I've been caught by the rain\nshower. I don't know whether to stop,\nput the camera away, and get a jacket on\nor just try and push get out of it. I\ncan see blue skies ahead of me.\nI'm currently riding along Route 66 in\nMy favorite part is how um crunchy the\nsugar is on top. It's got a nice little\nwhen you bite into it. It's very good.\nLook at that. ASMR. Do you hear that? We\ngot some onion rings, some fries, and\nsome beans coming.\ndone about 110k today uh so far.\nThere's a bit of washboard at the end\nwhich was\namazing. Thank you very much. Perfect.\n&gt;&gt; I think this is the\n&gt;&gt; 80. I think I've ordered too much food\ncuz I've got fries and onion rings and\nall. Back in the early 1900s before you\nhad the highway, this was all uh cattle\nrange. So that's why you have towns like\nevery 20 22 miles because that's how far\nyou could push a herd of cattle. And\nthere's a gentleman out here who had a\ngold claim and he would sell dried fruit\npies to the cowboys as they went\nthrough. So when it became a\nmunicipality, when they got a post\noffice and a fire uh fire station,\nthat's when they all decided to name it\nPitown.\nSo that's how you got the name Pitown\nNew Mexico. Well, we have an\naward-winning pie, a county\naward-winning pie. It's a green chilies,\num, apples, green chilies, and pinon\nnuts. And that one county's best pie,\nbut we do all kinds of fruit pies and\nstuff like that as well. And that's the\ncontinental divide. That that dyke right\nthere, that's the continental divide,\nyou know.\n&gt;&gt; And you get a lot of hikers and bikers\nthat come through here.\n&gt;&gt; Tons tons of hikers and bikers.\nI've set up a movie and I'm now having\ndinner. So, dinner is leftover chips and\nberry pie. Looking forward to to getting\nsome sleep and\nyeah, push push to Silver City tomorrow,\nwhich is the the pretty much the last\nmajor\nmajor city.\nthe last major place before you push to\nto Antelope Wells in the finish. So\nthat's exciting.\nUm definitely getting there. I'm\ncurrently bivvied outside a um pit\ntoilet. So I think that's another thing\nticked off the tour divide checklist.\nI've got a roof over here. So I think\nI'll leave the toilet available for\nanyone who might need it during the\nnight.\n5hour energy bear beach boys totally\nchanged your perspective. You're off.\nYou're flying\nto mark the time.\nOh,\nway way down we go.\nGot to rip that soul.\n&gt;&gt; I have sad news. Golden Girls closed 3\nyears ago.\nBurritos and hot dogs for dinner. It is\nno Golden Girls for us.\nIt's like joy. It's a bit of sadness.\nOh my god.\nI just can't believe that this is like\nthe last sunset. This is like the last\nthe last punish. Oh my god.\nWhat a freaking journey. Oh my god. I\njust feel so grateful that like\neverything feels good. My my mind feels\ngood, my body feels good, the weather is\ngood, I have a wonderful friend.\nYeah. Damn. What a journey.\nVery\nthankful that I don't have to share the\nthe outdoors with the snakes and the\nscorpions and the toads. Just before\nmidnight, get maybe an hour, an hour and\na half of sleep.\nLast reapplication of Shami better and\nI'm good to go.\nYou're in Hatcha, New Mexico. Um about\n50 mi from the finish. Couple miles of\npavement and then you'll hang a left.\nYou got about 5 miles of dirt roads.\nIt's got about 3 mi of sand, so you got\nto go fast on the sand or it'll bog you\ndepths. Um and it's kind of uphill. And\nthen you'll turn and get on the hiking\ntrail. And you got to real super bumpy\nand rocky. Uh canyons. There's a couple\nof canyons you got to get off a bush\nbecause it's a little too much. Um super\nbumpy all the way up till you'll hit the\ngranite pass road. It's maybe 12, 13 mi.\nAnd then you got 3 mi left of a single\ntrack that's got big mosques all overs\nlike that. Um, so you got to watch those\nor they'll give you a flat in a second\nor a ditch, you know. And so, and then\nyou'll hit the three miles. You got\nyou'll lose track of the trail, too. So,\nyou got to watch for the sign.\nThey're about every I don't know half a\nmile, a quarter mile or something.\nAnd then you'll hit the road. You got 31\nmiles of pace. It's you get a break for\nthe last 30 minutes. And then that's\nit's pretty flat that last stretch.\nIs this the last resupply at the end?\n&gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. There's nothing like the\ncourts.\n&gt;&gt; That continental divide trail was\nfun and it I've never\nridden through a forest of cacti before.\nBut\nthat that last bit through the thorns\nwas absolutely brutal. We're just like\npicking our way through randomly just\ntrying to find some blue signs with um\nCTD on it. Um\n&gt;&gt; CTD\n&gt;&gt; I don't know even know what it is. CDT.\nIt looks like CTD from here.\nBlue triangle.\nUh it's now 8:00 so not a chance of\ngetting to the antelope wells for um\nlight. We got about two hours, I think\n31 miles on the beautiful tarmac that\nI'm now sitting on, but the border is\nclosed, so no issues with traffic.\nYeah, sky is pretty amazing. There's\nparts of it like I really enjoyed, but\nthere was bits that was just a bit of a\nslog at the end of a 2,700 mile event.\nWe're a bit tired.\nI feel like it was a mountain biker's\nlittle dream. Lots of little like swoopy\nbits. Um, yeah. I really enjoyed it. I\nhad a good time.\n&gt;&gt; Every single last minute of it. You\nenjoyed\n&gt;&gt; every single last minute of it. Even the\n&gt;&gt; I did. I did.\nWow. And now we're done. That's it for\nthe\n&gt;&gt; We're not done. We got 31 miles.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. But we're done the hard part.\nOh man. And we get to enjoy this\nbeautiful sunset and this fresh tarmac\nas you say. I watched this man hit every\nsingle prickle bush that he could have.\nAnd his rear tire has honestly been\nthrough hell and back. I'm surprised\nthat it's still holding on after this\nentire however many miles kilome. But\nthis man hit every single prickle bush\non the way down. And I was like, he's\ngoing to pop a tire. He's going to pop a\ntire. Lo and behold, they held. I am\namazed and impressed.\n&gt;&gt; What can I say? Good tires.\nI'm ready for a shower. I feel\ndisgusting.\nI've been homeless for the last 3\nmonths, 3 weeks, 3 years.\n&gt;&gt; Only sometimes.\nLast night I was in a post office.\nAnd then the night before that I was in\na field. No, I was in a toilet block.\nThat's not a hotel. New Mexican Hilton.\nWhat do they call it? The Montana\nHilton.\n&gt;&gt; Montana Hilton. Montana.\n&gt;&gt; I thought they call Boys.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm pretty sure.\n&gt;&gt; I just don't believe that we're not\ngoing to be burning our brakes tomorrow.\nLike, that doesn't feel real.\n&gt;&gt; I think I've misjudged the the timing of\nevery single section of this whole\nroute.\nEverything's been about 3 hours longer\nthan I thought it was going to be.\n&gt;&gt; I feel like there were moments in which\nwe kind of just like took our time.\nexample, sleeping on the side of the\nroad in Colorado and that meant we\nmissed a giant storm. We didn't push on.\nWe missed like we missed so many storms\nalong the entire way. I just feel like\nwe've been very lucky. We've been very\nvery lucky. This like the guy at um the\nHoa um grocery store today was talking\nabout how we do it again and it's like,\nyou know, sure you could do it again,\nbut I feel like this experience has been\nso perfect. Like everything has just\nbeen perfect. Um the conditions have\nbeen amazing. Um you know, we did get a\ntaste of peanut butter. We did get a\ntaste of snow. We did get a taste of\nrain, but and and heat. Um but none of\nit was ever too much. It was like just\nthe perfect amount to get a taste for\nwhat um for what could be. And it just\nmade you kind of savor every moment and\nappreciate every moment you were in. And\nyeah, I I just feel like I couldn't have\nasked for a better divide at all. At\nall. It was It was a dream. Every minute\nwas a dream for sure.\nYou're just saying that cuz you don't\nwant to come back.\n&gt;&gt; Whoa.\nIt feels pretty surreal\nto be 50k away from the end. Just\nrolling in. It's super warm. So, it's\ngoing to be shorts and a jersey the\nwhole way.\nMaybe we'll get some stars again. How's\nthe body feeling?\n&gt;&gt; The body is feeling a little tired.\nWe've been pushing. We've been jamming\nand now I think our gas is running out a\nlittle bit and we have 15 km left.\n&gt;&gt; Oh my god, we almost [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] sorry. I\nshould have Okay, we almost just hit a\nhuge snake. Like Josh was on Were you on\nhis head side?\n&gt;&gt; And I was on his tail side and we just\nnarrowly missed it. Screamed. I think\nJosh maybe pooped himself.\n&gt;&gt; Oh my god.\nWe almost died.\n&gt;&gt; We almost died.\n&gt;&gt; No, it worked.\n&gt;&gt; We both went either side of a\nrattlesnake.\n&gt;&gt; Oh Jesus.",

          "transcript": "You've seen the Tour Divide race videos,\nright? You know the ones where riders\nbike all the way from BA to Mexico.\nWell, today we finally get to ride the\nfirst sliver of that very same route,\nthe Great Divide Mountain Bike Route.\nAnd let me tell you, it's every bit as\nepic as it looks online. Our ride starts\nin Canmore on the Legacy Trail. The plan\nis a 58 km loop with about 740 meters of\nelevation gain. From Canmore, we roll\nright on to the pave trail to Bamp. Hop\non the High Rockies Trail, cut over to\nGoat Creek, and finish back on the road\nto Canmore.\nThe Legacy Trail is great. It's a 26 km\npave path from Tenar to Bounce.\nSo, we're at our first rest stop. The\nskies are smoky and cloudy, but they're\nstill the views are still there.\n[Music]\nThe roller coaster.\nAnd from Canmore takes you right into\nthe city of B.\nNo parking required.\nRolling into B, we do a quick spin\nthrough town before hitting the gravel.\nThis is the official start of the gravel\nof the Great Divide mountain bike race.\nWe're going to ride a little bit of it\njust, you know, just for fun. See what\nit's actually like.\nThis is the official start of the Tour\nDivide Race, the same trail that carries\nriders all the way to Mexico.\nWe're only sampling the very beginning\ntoday, but wow, it delivers immediately.\nPerfect gravel, a mix of punchy climbs,\nfast flats. I have rivers flowing on one\nside of me and mountains towering on the\nother.\nSo far so good. Little bit of up, a\nlittle bit of down.\nGreat conditions on the trail.\nWe stop along the river for a quick\nbreak. And I'm always keeping an eye out\nfor bears. It's pretty remote out here.\nStill gets pretty rough up here. It's a\nwalker.\nThere's definitely a feeling of\nremoteness out here. We've only seen two\npeople. And yes, we have our bear spray.\nDefinitely in the wilderness.\nHonestly, this might just be the best\ngravel ride I've ever done.\nSo gorgeous.\nIt's cold.\nThat mountain air is\nso we made it to the top and now we're\ngoing to take the gravel road back to\nKenmore. layering up because it is cold.\nThat's for sure.\nThe trail eventually loops us to the\nSpray Lakes parking lot. This is where\nwe're starting tomorrow to continue on\nthe trail. Today, we're just dropping\ndown into Canmore.\nAnd look at this. Mountain sheep\neverywhere. Such a cool way to wrap up\nthe first day.\nBack in town for some relaxing and local\nsightseeing.\nIt's a cold start to the morning, but\nthe views are finally in full force\nand we're going to head down to Spray\nLakes. Continuing our journey along the\ntrails here,\nGoat Creek Trail.\nThis section is absolutely stunning. The\ngravel is smooth and the views are\nendless.\nIt's hard to believe this is the same\ntrail we've seen on all those Tour\nDivide films.\nThe Tour Divide route is 4,400\nkilometers with over 60,000 meters of\nelevation and it goes from B to Mexico.\nRiders can spend anywhere from 13 days\nto 3 months to complete it. And here we\nare. Just sampling the first 40k feels\npretty special.\nA few steep pitches and I even have to\nwalk my bike. But you know what? That's\nall part of the adventure.\nOnce you see the lake, there's a\ncampground and a perfect spot for a\npicnic.\nI think we found the perfect lunch spot.\nThen it's back to the parking lot. Along\nthe access road, we have the classic\nRocky Mountain views the whole way.\nOur ride today was 24 km and 314 m of\nelevation gain. So that's two days on\nthe Great Divide mountain bike route. We\ndid Camour to B and then Spray Lakes.\nBeautiful trails, smooth gravel,\nmountain views around every corner, and\na taste of one of the most iconic bike\nroutes in the world.\nHonestly, I think this might be the best\ngravel route I've done so far.

          "description": "Crisscrossing the Continental Divide for 2,750 miles between Banff in the Canadian Rockies and Antelope Wells on the Mexican border, the Great Divide is one the world’s most iconic long distance mountain biking routes. On this sky high trail, there’s no such thing as a regular ride. But even by ultra cycling standards, Lael Wilcox’s history on the route is a colourful one. \n\nIn 2015, Lael raced the Tour Divide – an event that follows the route – and set a new women’s course record despite having to ride herself to an emergency room en route to deal with a persistent breathing issue. But rather than celebrating her achievement, Lael set out to better it. Just two weeks later, she rode to the start from her home in Alaska, took on the trail for a second time and lowered her own record by another day and a half. \n\nToday, the outright course record is held by the late long-distance legend Mike Hall, whose time of 13 days 22 hours and 51 minutes has stood since 2016. Inspired by Mike’s methodical approach to managing the mileage but convinced she can beat the record, Lael is returning the Rockies with unfinished business. In the latest episode of Rapha Gone Racing, we document her latest record attempt and follow her as she runs into issues much bigger than any bike ride. \n\n#GoneRacing\n\nMusic: Builder’s Tea - https://builders-tea.com\n\n——————————————————\n\nGet more from Rapha:\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/rapha/ \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/rapharacing/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/rapha",

sister would speak for me she was\nolder than me but i always loved sports\ni always thought in distance i always\nthought how far could i go\ncould i hike across the country could i\nrun across the country and then\nthat eventually transitioned into bikes\na lot of it was like seeing uh adventure\ncycling association maps\nthere are these long distance routes and\nthen i want to ride all of them the\ngreat divide was always like kind of the\nbackbone of that\ni first raced the tour divide in 2015\ni had\na terrible breathing problem i actually\nrode myself to the emergency room and\ncontinued on i struggled for a couple\nmore days and then picked up my pace and\nin that stretch beat the women's record\nby two days and everyone's like oh great\njob that was so amazing and\npersonally i was like if i didn't get\nsick i would have done so much better so\nliterally i flew back to alaska and then\nwithin two weeks was riding back to the\nstart again\nand i wrote another time trial on it\nthat august and took my own record down\nby a day and a half\nmy call reset the record in 2016 and he\nsaid it at just under 14 days 13 days 22\nhours 51 minutes\nhe had this kind of very like cutthroat\napproach where he slept very little and\nhe would say things like you have to\ncrave miles and i remember i read an\narticle about him and i was like this is\nexactly the way you have to do it\ni want to get the overall record i think\ni can do it i have to ride 200 miles a\nday for 14 days and then i i can get the\nrecord\nshe rolled out of bed this morning ready\nto go she just doesn't seem phased like\nshe's totally relaxed joking around you\nwouldn't know like what she's about to\ntake on\nthis is actually the first time i've\never seen layla in person i followed the\nvideos that she's made and kind of the\njourney and it's inspired me a lot in\nbike packing i feel like she blends\nhaving a competitive spirit while still\nmaking it a community focused sport\nthat's welcoming to everybody\nlaila is an amazing lady she started at\nmy house the the first time she ever\nrode the divide the first two times she\nwas an underdog man and now everyone\nknows what she's capable of\nshe keeps it real\nuh i'm dave dave morgan\ni live in calgary happening to be doing\na bit of a ride at the moment and i just\ngot passed by my\nfull-time hero for endurance cycling\nlil world cups\nshe just blasted up the hill past me\nshe's awesome\ni i had a lazy start today because i\nhaven't been on my bike for\ntwo months and my legs are hurting and\ni'm out of shape and i'm overweight and\nmy bike's too heavy and when she went\npast me it's made my day\nit's everything i needed from today\n[Applause]\nso currently there's uh the hay creek\nfire near whitefish montana that's\nblocking red meadow lake road\nso i'm working to make a reroute around\nthat section\nthis is very very common especially more\nand more with climate change that\nwildfires are happening in the west\nclosing parts of the route\nthose guys are just dark\nyou know there are mountains all around\nyou but you can hardly see outlines\nbecause it's so so smoky\nso this is the fire reroute\ni did an extra\nmassive out and back\ni can definitely feel the smoke\nmy thought is to try and possibly get a\nroom in\nwhitefish or\ncolumbia falls if i can\njust to get out of the smoke\nfor a few hours\nand take a shower to try to clear up my\nbreathing\ni'm a little worried because i have\npretty bad asthma but\ni had a nice sleep in the cabin last\nnight i was alone in there so that was\nreally good even had some faux mats that\ni could\nsleep on so that was pretty luxurious\nand yeah otherwise things are good it's\nnine o'clock so i've been going for\n36 hours\nand i've gone\n305 miles\nmy\nit's always nice to see town lights in\nthe dark\nit feels so weird to be like\noutside like\nwith wild animals one minute and then\nthe next year like checking into a best\nwestern\nand they're like do you want a\nking-sized bat or two\nthere we queens\nah\ni realized\nthat these big rides really are\nonly\npersonal\nwhat you get out of it is really for\nyourself because i\nafter i raced the tour divide twice in\n2015 i almost had a hard time like\nrelating to people i'd been through so\nmuch personal like hardship and they're\nlike wow what you're doing is amazing\nand i was like kind of scarred by just\nlike scarfing down hot dogs for three\nmonths\nyou know i was like how amazing is that\nyou start kind of doubting what it is\nthen you realize well if you're going\nback to it you're the one putting\nyourself in that situation i mean this\nis like the same idea i have about when\npeople are like oh you must just love\nsuffering\nthat like is offensive to me\nlike we are not suffering suffering is\nsomething that happens to you that you\ncan't control if you are engaging in a\nbike race you're making that decision\nyou know own it be part of it or just\ndon't do it\npretty awesome\nso\nwhat are you doing up here\nwho's that\noh hi there i'm just cycling through and\ni called and they said that\nit was okay for me to sleep in the\nchurch\ni'm making all these decisions because i\nwant to\nbecause i want to see what's possible i\nmean i used to get like anxiety going\ninto gas stations\nbecause i spent so much time like\nscrambling around like oh yeah i gotta\nget this sandwich from these cokes and\nbe fast i know there's a lie\ni told you guys last night brett taylor\ni saw a mountain lion at the top of the\nlast climb\ni don't want to scare it\nbut uh\ni do want to get by\ni'll just see how this goes\nfirst time i've ever seen a mountain\nlion in my life i just stopped and stood\nthere and started like talking to it and\nthen i could hear like little squeaks i\nthink she had little cups\ni'm just walking behind this mountain\nlion pushing my bike talking to her for\nlike 15 or 20 minutes i was always like\noh i'd love to see a mountain lion\nsomeday just because it's so cool it's\nlike majestic and this one had like kind\nof a creepy mustache and i was like oh\nyou know it just didn't look very good i\nsaw another animal running ahead of me\nand at first i thought it was like a\nsquirrel and then it\nwas a skunk\nand then this morning i chased a moose\nwith a huge rack\nit's a little shallow\ni had to like lay down and then flop\nover like a fish\nstill breathing\nbut man it's been smoky since the second\nday\nshoes\nhey there uh what kind of burritos do\nyou guys have\num\nthank you so much\nbeen really prioritizing sleeping inside\nbecause of all the smoke and then\nsleeping four hours at a time because\ni'm like trying to recover my lungs\nwhich\nis a losing battle\nbut\ni feel like once i get through smoky\nareas then i could pick it up a little\nbit more and\nsleep outside and not have to worry\nabout it just kind of odd to be\nlike on a\nadventure ride through the rockies\nlooking for a post office to sleep in\notherwise i'm like if i get\ntoo like messed up that i'd have to quit\nand i've had to do that before so\njust trying to be smart\nthat's like the biggest priority for\nsure it's like\nif i have to quit that's the biggest\nand i'm just failure i'm\ndriving through um on the divide and i'm\njust looking to see if i could stay\nthere for\ntonight uh to get out of all the smoke\nso basically call back\nmy name is jack soviero\ni live at divide montana\ni've lived in this area 27 years and\noriginally from butte montana\nmountains are very beautiful it's a\nwonderful place to live\nwhat was all from all the fire wildfires\nhere there i believe there's three to\nfour of them\nyeah it's exceptionally hot dry summers\nwe have seen fires in this area\nnot this bad\nokay\ni guess i'm just disappointed\nbut it's okay\ni feel like\ni can feel my lungs kind of shutting\ndown and\ni know that's\nlike\nkind of a danger zone for me because i\nhave really bad asthma\nit's tough\nbecause i'm so willing to put up with\npain or put up with problems try to\novercome things and then this is a\nsituation that i just\ncan't really\nfight i'm not that like sad about not\nriding it because i've ridden it three\ntimes three and a half but\ni'm sad about giving up on something\nthe record is still very exciting to me\nnow it feels very personal\ni mean my ride's one thing but it's\nreally sad just to see the state of this\nterrain it looks\nmiserable the people in these\ncommunities look miserable\nthis is not a life anybody wants to live\nyou can't spend time outside you know\neverybody would talk about it everywhere\ni went you know and then fortunate for\nme it's like i can just leave but\nyou know these these people can't just\nleave that's their home\nthe bigger message overall was like this\nis pretty depressing to see\nthese fires in the smoke and how that's\nlike casting just this huge gray shadow\nover our lives\ni don't know i just hate quitting\nyou",
