Greg Gleason describes the whole event as 'like a train wreck in many ways. You can see the imminent disaster coming from a long ways off.' The anti-logistics were intentional, designed to test problem-solving without race support. As Guitar Ted [ELITE/Race Director] puts it: \"Most every Iowa gravel road has a 'street sign' on the corner of intersections. When this isn't the case, (Rare), we will mark a corner with flags.\""

        "explanation": "320-340 miles in 34 hours with zero support created proper suffering. Greg Gleason and Walter needed convenience store fuel stops every 100+ miles: 'Mountain Dew, fried pies, pizza, and topping off our water bottles.' Even in the favorable conditions of V12, only 55% finished versus the typical 15-20% rate. This wasn't just long—it was 'carry county maps in case you get lost' long. Among the longest in gravel, comparable to Badlands.

        "explanation": "Iowa gravel roads don't require advanced bike handling—the challenge was navigating by cue sheets in darkness and dealing with conditions. Kate Ankofski found 'riding at night, alone' required focus on 'pedaling up hills you can't see, guided solely by a few hundred lumens.' Technical difficulty came from conditions and paper navigation, not terrain demanding bike skills. Less technical than The Mid South. As Greg Gleason puts it: \"With 75 miles to go to the finish, Walter and I put on a couple of extra layers and headed back onto the dark windy gravel.\""

Greg Gleason noted the final 75 miles featured 'steep, freshly graveled hilltops that headed directly into the south-east wind.' Guitar Ted warned riders would be 'either going up or down, and doing that over and over, ad infinitum,' but at corn-growing elevations. Less climbing than The Mid South.

        "explanation": "Late April in Iowa delivered the worst of Midwest spring weather—V2, V4, V6, and V11 were all truncated or affected by brutal conditions. Rain turned the B-roads into impassable mud that could 'swallow riders whole,' while cold and wind made the 34-hour exposure dangerous. The weather wasn't just uncomfortable, it was race-ending. More weather exposure than Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego.

        "explanation": "Trans Iowa delivered pure adventure racing—secret routes, paper navigation, complete self-sufficiency, and real consequences. Jeff Kerkove witnessed riders 'sitting quietly in a convenience store staring with eyes glazed over onto a slice of pizza covered in Cheetos.' Kate Ankofski learned how badly she wanted this during mile-long portage sections through B-road mud. This was gravel's last truly wild race."

        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Trans Iowa earned cult status as gravel's original sufferfest—14 years of breaking souls before most people knew what gravel racing was. V2's zero finishers and the mystique around Guitar Ted's deliberately rough organization built legend status among the hardcore. It never cracked mainstream awareness like Unbound, capping its prestige at underground classic rather than household name."
      },
      "race_quality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Race quality was intentionally rough around the edges—secret routes until race day, cue sheets only, zero support, and weather that regularly forced truncations (V4, V6, V11). Guitar Ted ran it like a rogue adventure, not a polished production. When 19 of 95 finished the final edition and multiple years saw single-digit finishers, you're looking at organized chaos more than refined racing."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "This was gravel's vision quest—340 miles of Iowa farmland with nothing but cue sheets and your ability to suffer through 34 hours. Rolling through small towns at 3 AM, navigating by paper in the dark, buying gas station burritos as your lifeline creates memories that outlast any medal. The complete self-sufficiency and secrecy made every edition feel like you were part of something underground."
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Trans Iowa built a tight cult around the 'TI Family' who understood the specific madness of Iowa B-roads and peanut butter mud. Guitar Ted's pre-race steakhouse gathering and the shared suffering created camaraderie among the 100-rider cap. But the community stayed deliberately small—never growing beyond the hardcore willing to risk everything on unmarked roads."
      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "With only 100 riders max and frequent single-digit finish rates, the field was shallow but absolutely committed. V10's record 106 starters was the peak, but most years saw far fewer willing to attempt the full distance. The no-entry-fee policy attracted dedicated sufferers rather than casual participants, creating quality over quantity in the small field. Less competitive depth than Almanzo 100. As Greg Gleason puts it: \"Sarah leaned over to me and said, 'Time to pick up the pace.' With that signal the race started.\""
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Free entry made Trans Iowa unbeatable on paper value—340 miles of organized suffering for zero dollars. But the hidden costs were brutal: potential bike destruction on B-roads, mandatory self-sufficiency gear, and the real possibility of spending your weekend DNF'd in Iowa mud. You got exactly what you paid for: pure adventure with zero amenities."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Registration runs $100-200. No entry fee meant your biggest costs were getting to Grinnell and having someone ready to extract you from rural Iowa when things went wrong. Accommodation was cheap in small-town Iowa, and gas station resupply kept food costs minimal during the race. The catch was gear—you needed everything from navigation to emergency supplies since zero support was the whole point. Similar expense level to Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

          "transcript": "if you want to buy a gravel bike well\nyou've basically got two options you can\nbuy a super capable adventure bike or\nyou can buy a gravel race bike for\n[Music]\nSpeed now I know what you're thinking\nthey do just look like bikes but there\nare some very key differences my\nadventure bike has a comfier riding\nposition it also has easier gears for\ngetting up very steep climbs and there\nare loads of cool frame mounts I could\nliterally pack the kitchen sink the\nLiams bike is generally going to be\nheavier and that more upright ride\nposition is going to be a bit slower the\ngravel race bike is all about speed so\nI've got aerot tubes harder gearing and\nit comes with an unhealthy disregard for\nyour personal safety\nso what sets these apart and crucially\nwhich is right for you well seeing as\nit's a very nice day let's go for a nice\nbike ride where we can dive into the\nsimilarities the differences and then I\nwill run you through a great and simple\nway to check which gravel bike you\nshould buy but first thanks to today's\nsponsor Tre for providing us with their\nlatest checkpoint and brand new\nCheckmate bikes\nnow my gravel bike has loads of snazzy\nAero optimized tubes to help me go\nfaster now they're not going to make as\nmuch of a difference as simply\noptimizing your position we proved that\nin the Wind Tunnel last year but if\ngoing fast is your primary objective\nthose tubes are the Aero icing of the go\nfast cake just check out the frame\ndesign it's way deeper and more angular\nthan the tubes you'll find on most\nadventure bikes the intention is to\nreduced drag which is the enemy of speed\nif going fast is your primary objective\nthen the gravel race bike is for\nyou but Arrow isn't reserved for gravel\nrace bikes an adventure bike can have\nsome Arrow touches but mostly the tube\nshapes are designed for compliance and\ncomfort helping you to ride for longer\nand that brings me onto my next\npoint an adventure bike is designed for\nseeing the beau Countryside not whizzing\npast it on this Frame you'll find a\ntaller front end and the whole vibe will\nbe a little bit more relaxed or slack if\nyou will it's a nice place to be on Long\nrides but crucially it also gives you a\nload of control on Tech stuff because\nlet's be honest crashing isn't really\nthat fun once again my gravel race bike\nis optimized for efficiency so the front\nend is a little bit lower and the bar is\na little bit narrower to tuck me out of\nthe wind the stem's also a little bit\nlonger to C down the handling and I'm\nriding at Furious high speeds there are\nalso a host of smaller details to notice\non this Frame and for me the mounts are\ncrucial I've got loads with mounts on\nthe top tube the down tube the underside\nof the bottom bracket fork legs and mud\nguard mounts poor old Jack barely has\nanything on his race bike but that is\nbecause you generally carry a lot less\nin a gravel race I've also got extra\ncompliance built into the rear end of\nthe bike through the decoupler system\nnow I'm not about to suggest that it\ndoes anything like what a rear shock\ndoes on a mountain bike but it adds a\nlittle Comfort which on a long day I'll\ngladly take now lean's bike also has\ninternal routing for a dropper post\nwhich is a feature I love on an\nadventure bike because if you want to\nget extra ad on Rowdy terrain it'll let\nyou put your weight down lower move the\nsaddle out the way and get further back\non bike for big SS damn dog keeps\nBing race bikes are also generally quite\na bit lighter than an adventure bike so\nif your idea of a nice ride involves\nplenty Hills the gravel race bike is for\nyou but what's actually adding weight to\nan Adventure frame well the extra\ncomfort features like the decoupler here\nand the frame mounts will add a bit but\nmostly just everything on an adventure\nbike will be a bit more robust in its\nbuild so everything from the wheels up\nto the saddle will be able to handle\nrougher Trails does weight really matter\nthough maybe if you're a fast racer or\nyou are just simply a weight weeny but\nfor most of us regular Riders I think\nthere are more important things you\nshould focus on\nthe main difference between our bikes\ncomes in the tire width that you can fit\nand that does a huge amount in\ndetermining the sort of terrain a bike\nis suitable for Le's bike can fit chunky\n50 mm wide tires as mine is limited to\n45 but Jack's bike is designed for\nracing and the current prot Trend sits\nbetween somewhere like 40 to 45 mm width\nbasically don't let blame his tires for\na bad race performance the simple way to\nlook at this is that my wider tires open\nthe bike up to garia trails in fact you\nreally have to get on to some pretty\nsteep stuff before this can't be\nridden while the race and Adventure\nbikes do have some differences they do\nhave some things in common and the first\nthing that I want to touch on is\nintegration weirdly we're now seeing a\nfeature on adventure bikes that we used\nto only ever see on AO race bikes that\nis integrated front ends these may look\ncool but position changes are difficult\nadjustability is problematic and if you\nhave anything go wrong with a big long\nadventurous ride the chances of finding\nspare parts are little to none it is a\nbit weird if you ask us but at least\nsome brands do it well routing the\ncables under the bar and stem like I've\ngot here now suspension has been\ncreeping into the gravel world and loads\nof bikes both race and Adventure bikes\nnow have the ability to fit a bouncy\nFork now the travel a dedicated gravel\nFork gives you is limited compared to a\nmountain bike Fork but both gravel\nRacers and adventurers have been seen\nrepurposing mountain bike Forks on\nmountain bikes with drop bars or on\ngravel bikes so definitely a cool Trend\nto look out for I personally am a bit of\na fan of gravel suspension having tried\nit last year but I know that it's not\nfor everyone so if you are a fan or if\nyou're not let me know in the comments\nthere are also more similarities than\ndifferences in the gearing these days\nmost gravel bikes use one by gearing\nthese days and a lot of racers are using\nwide range cassettes when they would\nhave been reserved for adventure bikes\nin the past there are some small\ndifferences you'll tend to see more of\nRam's axis Eagle Mountain Bike\ncomponents on adventure bikes whereas 2\nby is pretty much only ever seen on\ngravel race bikes these days really\nthough A good rule of thumb is that the\nwidest cassettes are best for adventure\nriding where you need a good spread of\nGears while a race bike that doesn't\nreally need that much range can fit a\ntighter cassette and you can get more\neven Cadence\njumps all right I've dropped jack off\nand come back to the studio because I\nwant to well shed some light and add\nsome color to the debate about whether\nyou should buy a gravel race or gravel\nadventure bike given that you might be\ndropping a few grandon one and the lines\nbetween the two categories might be\nquite blurry I think this quick check is\nimportant to do so if we take the most\ncommon features of a gravel bike like\nspeed weight Tire clearance Etc they're\njust up here all you need to do is pop\nthese seven categories in order of\nimportance to you and then give them a\nrating of 1 to five based on how much\nyou kind of care about them so I care\nmost about speed so I'll give that a\nfive and you can go all the way down to\ncarrying capacity and like drop a post\nwhich I don't really care about because\nI don't really go bike packing just give\neach score to the bike that does better\nin that category and well there you go\nwhile I've been riding the adventure\nbike today the race bike is actually\nbetter for me it's a pretty good way of\ndeciding between two bikes if you're a\nbit stuck give it a go add in your own\ncategories if you think of more and let\nme know if you find it useful and if you\nwant to know about the brilliant problem\nWitham's new gravel group set click on\nthat video as ever please

          "transcript": "hello welcome back to another video\ntoday I'm going to show you how I've\nplanned my route for the\nTranscontinental race um now the\nTranscontinental race is a\nself-supported bike packing race across\nEurope and it's a free route race so\nyou're basically given checkpoints and\num set parkour sectors by the race\norganizers and then you have to make\nyour own route so I use ryber GPS for\nthis so in this in this video I'm just\ngoing to show you how I use riber GPS uh\nto to create my route um so let's let's\nget into it now obviously rber GPS is my\npreferred sort of planning um software\nwebsite I've used this since the first\nedition in 2013 um so I've actually done\ntwo tcrs already and um yeah I used Rob\nGPS both times but I think my my kind of\nplanning has got a bit more refined over\ntime so um I'll run you through this is\nprobably going to be a two-stage video\nI'm going to run you through um the\nbasic kind of planning and then I go\nI'll go into a little bit more depth in\nthe second video as to how I sort of\nfine-tune things and little tips and\ntricks that that make life easier when\nI'm on the road um before I go any\nfurther um red shift is sponsoring all\nmy transcontinental race coverage so big\nthank you to those guys I'm actually\nusing the shock stop Pro suspension stem\non my bike for TCR um not it's not often\nyou see suspension seat suspension stems\non road bikes but um I've been testing\nit out and it it makes a big difference\nactually and um I'm hoping over the\ncourse of the race especially the\noff-road sectors it really adds up so\nwithout fur further Ado let's have a\nlittle look and um and start the\nplanning so I'll start off just showing\nyou the the website um the\nTranscontinental race is run by lost Dot\nand um well in their own in their own\nwords the the Transcontinental race was\nfounded in 2013 By The Late Mikel a\ngiant of the AR scene is a single stage\nrace across Europe where cyclists cover\naround 4,000 kilometers um Race date is\n21st of July um as I speak it's about 9\ndays away um but by the time you're\nwatching this video I'm probably\nsomewhere in Europe so um yeah get on\nthe tracker and and have a little look\num but they give you a rough outline of\nof the route so as you can see there's\nuh four checkpoints and a start and a\nfinish so the start is in the rubbe vome\nin northern France the first checkpoint\num is in Slovenia I'm I'm not going to\nbutcher that name because I'm pretty bad\nat pronunciations cp2 is in uh Bosnia um\nagain I'm going to refrain from\nbutchering butchering that uh that place\nname but essentially um it's the the\nhills above sovo where the the Winter\nOlympics were held I think it was\n1992 around that time maybe a bit\nearlier and then PR Kosovo um kakay um\nin turkey cp4 that was actually a finish\nin I believe it was 2016 um I actually\nstarted that Edition and then I\nscratched after after less than 24 hours\nI just wasn't in the right place so it'd\nbe quite nice to to get back there there\nand and finish that business and then\nthe classic finish Istanbul in Turkey um\nthere the first three editions of the\nrace finished in Istanbul before it was\nmoved elsewhere uh I actually won the\nlast Edition that finished in in\nIstanbul which is quite nice so it's\ngoing to be nice to return there um so\nyeah so that's the route and there's a\ncouple of Parkour sectors um and yeah\nthey're basically they're they're\nprovided by the race organizer um oh\nlook there that's me in estanbul um so\nwhat I've done is I've downloaded to\nstart all the all the checkpoints off um\nuh provided by by lost do the race\norganizers I've uploaded them into riber\nGPS you can see that here so there's\nstart parkour parkour one two three uh\nfour and the finished parkour um so\nthese are the parkour some of the\ncheckpoints are on the parkour other\ncheckpoints are um a point slightly off\nthe parkour um so I'm going to um I'll\nadd those in as well um so what I'm\ngoing to do to start with I'm going to\nput all these in a collection so they're\nall in one place so I'll go to\ncollections um you can see I've already\ndone some planning and various other\nroutes I'm looking at doing and various\nraces um but I've created a new\ncollection somewhere here we go TCR\nparkour 2024 um I'm just going to import\nThe Roots so start parkour one 2 3 4 and\nfinish add those in there um and you can\nsee 229 miles worth of of preset uh\nrouts um and then they'll populate this\nmap here um it takes a little while\nsometimes just to to load up the image\nand then you can get a nice kind of um\noverview of of the route now I'm not\ngoing to plan the entire route on this\nvideo so what I'm going to do is what\nwhat I'd the first stage for me would be\nplan sector by sector um so I go from\nthe start to parkour one then uh or cp1\nthen cp1 cp2 uh CP3 cp4 and so on so I'd\nhave like five or six big chunks of the\nrace and then I'll fine-tune those and\nthen after that I'll split them down um\nso the splitting down part I'll do in\nthe second video in this one I'm just\ngoing to focus on how I'd how I'd look\nat um planning a route uh in you know\nbetween checkpoints now I'm not going to\ndo the the entire thing but I'm going to\npick a couple of checkpoints um which\nwhich I think um is a good indication of\nof various different things you can use\nso I'm going to go with parkour one and\nparkour 2 and um so yeah these are two\nso basically Slovenia uh to\nuh Saro um or Bosnia so what I'm going\nto do is I'm going to open up the the\nfirst sector here and as you can see um\nthere's a start and a finish and the\ncheckpoint is actually on top of the\nmountain up here somewhere um I need to\nget the exact um the the exact uh\nlocation of the um of the organizers I'm\npretty sure it's one of these little I\nthink it's this one here um so we we\nwe'll say it's that one there um the\nlittle the little host hostile here um\nso I'll mark that up to start with so um\nbefore I go any further let's get into\nthe edit section and I'm just going to\ndrop a little POI bear in mind it is\nworth double-checking it but um I don't\nwant to open too many tabs and and\nconfus myself right now um so I'll just\nput this in as a a POI put the\ncheckpoint in control that's normally\ngood thing to do and I'll just put\ncp1 um so there we go then we can see it\non there\num um and now what I'm going to do is\nI'm basically I'm just going to add the\nsecond parkour into this uh CP cp2 is\nactually on the second parkour um so\nthis is why it's quite a good example um\nso what I'm going to do is go on to the\ntop left here um import existing so if I\nclick on that you can then see that it's\nit's got a load of different roots on\nhere so TCR number 10 parkour 2 if I\nclick on that and click add a\nplanner then it's it's just put it in\nthere um which is pretty useful so I'll\ngo back to the first one here um so what\nyou want to do is you\nsee I want to start on the parkour one\nyou can see the two different layers on\nthe left here so parkour one is a layer\nparkour two as a layer I want to go\nparkour one to parkour 2 so parkour one\nis here and you can see if we zoom in\num the parkour 2 is then if I if I hold\nmy cursor over the parkour or two in the\nin the left hand bar it highlights blue\nand you can see this Green Dot at the\nstart of it now if I click that Green\nDot it's basically just link the two\ntogether so now you can see we've we've\ngot the starting like the start workings\nof of of our route um so essentially\nthat could be a route to use bearing in\nmind you are you have got driving\nselected on the left here so it's\nprobably going to um take you on\nmotorways and things I tend to keep it\non the driving setting for um certainly\nin in in the south Europe for rout\nplanning because otherwise sometimes it\nit just sends you on um really small\nlittle tiny paths and tracks and things\nand the TCR you on a quite a fast direct\nroute obviously you're not going to ride\ndown the motorway um although that did\nhappen in early days but um yeah driving\nis better but you got to make sure\nyou're not on like roads where you can't\ncycle so that's that's all part of the\nchecking process so now that we have\nthis um what I'm going to do I'm just\ngoing to rename it so if you click on\nthe left here um up at T c number 10\nI'll just put C cp1 to\ncp2 and then save that um and now\nbasically I do that for for all the\nsectors so start to cp1 um and then so\non all the way through um and then I'd\nbasically once I've got that I'll go\ninto it and I'll start planning a little\nbit more now as you can see um the thing\nabout the TCR is you kind of want to\ntake a fairly direct route but sometimes\nit's better to go slightly longer and\nslightly flatter than than hilia because\nyou get higher average speed and it's\nless energy um so I find these Google\nMap layers really useful down the side\nhere so um at the moment I'm on the\nGoogle Maps um the ryber GPS layer is is\ngood but I I to be honest I prefer\nGoogle just because um I use it quite a\nlot just on my phone anyway so it's it's\nquite good to um like I understand it\nreally well um and in this instance\nriding on the road is it's good and also\nGoogle terrain is a good layer cuz that\nthen gives you an idea of what you're\ndealing with so obviously quite hilly\nand mountainous on the south south of\nthe route but then you see up here it's\nthere's a big Flat River Valley um so\nactually that sort of starts to indicate\nthat maybe you might want to go for a\nflatter route and so let's let's have a\nlittle look and and see um you know see\nif we can change it so I'm just going to\ngrab it and pull it over this way um and\nsee if that makes any difference and\nit's taken well 5,000 m off the climbing\num and it's given us 20 mil more\num however I think that's probably going\nto be a more realistic kind of uh route\nto take um nice and flat and fast um and\nthe thing we can also do is uh we can\nlook at um past tracking as well so we\ncan I took this up from um last year's\ntranscontinental race which as you can\nsee took a a fair fairly similar um\nroute through the Balkans certainly went\nthrough S sovia the checkpoint was\nfurther south now what I've done here\nI've gone on to the the replay and if\nyou if you highlight Riders on the side\nhere it puts their route up and their\ntrack now the the checkpoints a bit\nfurther over than it was this year um so\nthe checkpoint for\n2024 is in this uh this basically\nnorthwest corner of Slovenia so it was\nmore Central sort of in the in the\ncenter North like basically north of\nlibyana um in in 20 2023 um but we can\nwe can use this as a good kind of gauge\nof of where we should be going so um\nthat's Christoph straser the winner\nRobin gella he was second Tim devit he\nwas third um and that that gives us an\nidea um oh and will valson he's he's\ndone like a totally different route so\nit gives us a few options as to to what\nmight be a sensible route and if you\nstart looking at them you can kind of\nsee that most of them have gone through\nZagreb um libyana Zagreb um and then\nkind of gone down this Big River Valley\num which is looking like it's probably\ngoing to be the better option the other\nthing we can do um is use the heat Maps\num so heat Maps if I turn it off they\nshow you where all the Riders have have\nbeen in the last well this all time the\nlast 30 days Etc um not not all that\nmany people ride in the Balkans so quite\noften you'll find some pretty strong\nlines on um in the Balkans from from\npeople who be riding so when they're\nwhen they're like blue um really purple\nit means a lot of people are in there\nyou can see a big outline here that was\nfrom the accursed race I did earlier\nthis year so that's my own personal\nroute um so you can see that you know I\nknow the area a little bit um so yeah\nyou can see um there's some some\npatterns forming again following this\nRiver Valley there's a big road this\nside um which we we could take um and\nthere's other roads you know you can see\nthat that there there's obvious ways um\nthe other thing you need to take into\naccount with the transcontinent rat is\nbanned roads so this is also really\ngoing to inform where you want to go so\nthere's a there's a number of roads\nwhich are banned or you have Road\nwarnings on um this is kind of for\nsafety and sometimes I think they're\nthey're banned just to kind of inform\nthe um the route a bit and kind of\nmanipulate where you're going so you can\nsee Ser evu there's some band roads\naround here um from banel Luca U\nbasically in towards where our\ncheckpoint is um there's another band\nroad across here so you can already see\nthat we're kind of going to be filtered\num down a certain route or around the\nedge um and then there's a couple of\nother band roads this one I think is a\nband tunnel stretch of road into Zagreb\nso that forces you um not to use the\nmain the main sort of way into Zagreb I\nguess um I imagine there's a big sort of\nuh funnel of traffic and it gets quite\nbusy um and then there's\nanother there's another band Road over\nhere as well um so yeah you can see that\num it's it's kind of um there's a number\nof options um and yeah it's kind of then\nthen it's a case of kind of filtering it\ndown and and seeing what's going to be\nbest so let's start with sort of the\nband Road areas so this isn't going to\nbe super precise because um I just I\ndon't want this video to be hours but\nyou can see it's taking us directly down\nthis band Road here um and obviously we\nknow already we can't do that so um\nprobably going to have to pull across\nhere and you can see that there's\nthere's there's some kind of pretty\nstrong heat Maps so we'll go on them um\nI always keep an eye on the distance at\nthe bottom here and the elevation so 455\nmil obviously you want a direct route\nbut you don't want to be super direct\nand um you know just go straight over\nmassive mountains when you can avoid it\nthe other thing I do because of I use\nGoogle I use the Google man quite a lot\njust to check the roads see what they're\nlike um if you end up on a Motorway it's\nnot ideal and it can get you\ndisqualified because obviously you're\nnot not allowed to ride on motorways um\nso I always just check as I'm going\nalong just to see what it's like um also\ngives you you know some expectations um\nof what you know what you can expect um\nso yeah so I guess there there's two\nreal ways in um we need to Mark these\nband roads here as well so the band\nroads um I think it's this one down this\nRiver Valley this E6 661 um let's zoom\nin yeah the e661 the one across to Vitz\nand the\ne73 well is that\nbanned yeah that's banned a warning and\nsome Bann roads um but to be honest if\nthey're banned it's it's probably for\nreason and normally because it's it's\npretty Grim to ride so the e661 is\nthere\num so yeah we're going to be it's going\nto be tricky to get down there um um\nVitz is there probably going to have to\ngo further over this way um something\nlike that\nmaybe so yeah but that adds like 20\nmiles on and a bit more climbing so you\ncan see you can see there's there's a\nlot of playing about to be done with it\num and also some gravel tracks in there\num so you can tell there's gravel by the\nthe by the um the the color of the the\nprofile at the bottom here so 454 24,000\nM that's probably a bit better um let's\njust check that's not one of the band\nroads so that is\nr440 um where are yeah so that's this\none here um the\nr440 so that that should be okay\num and then we'll just have to make sure\nwe don't touch this this band Road at\nthe bottom here so let's let's have a\nlook at that again um as I said I'm I'm\nnot not really digging into Super detail\non this video it's just an example um\nyou can see there there there is some\ngravel on this section um so that's\nsomething to be be wary of as well I\nmean you you could you could take a risk\nin ride some gravel tracks but they can\nbe quite rough in the bulans um so\nthat's\n4 348 to 357 that's quite a lot of\ngravel um so it depends whether you're\nhappy to take the risk I'm going to\nleave it there for this for this example\njust because like I say time is is kind\nof um pretty key um this band road we\nneed to avoid it because I think it\nfinishes at this point here um so we can\nprobably just drag it around like that\num just double check again on here yeah\nso that's the point there it finishes so\nif we just skirt that that should be\nokay um and then it has gone down this\ne661 let's check that it's not Bann\nthere no that's not Bann there so we'll\nzoom in a bit and I'll just check this\nroad because it does look like it's a\nbit bigger but sometimes you never know\nwhat what could be a Motorway in the\nnorth of Europe ends up just sort of\nbeing a trunk Road um so yeah it doesn't\nlook overly big um I guess there'll be\nfairly consistent slow traff flow of\ntraffic but not too bad um so yeah I\nI'll stick with that for now um for the\npurpose of this video anyway obviously\nmy actual route I'm not going to give\nyou exactly what I'm doing because I\nspent hours and hours trying to plan it\num but again you can see different\noptions here um with with kind of heat\nMaps so maybe that might be a better\noption let's just check that anyway and\nsee so 451 and 24,000 meters of\nclimbing um no it's it's slightly\nshorter but a bit more hilly so we're\nnot going to do that one I'll leave it\nhow it was um so yeah and then into the\ncheckpoint um just check there's no\nbaned roads around\nSaro uh where are we Saro um so yeah as\nyou can see it's it's quite in depth and\nyou know you can't just do this in one\nhit you need to to go over it numerous\ntimes um yeah looks like we're safe in s\nover no band roads down that southern\nsection um and that that obviously links\nup into the the parkour here which is\ngravel um and the uh the checkpoint is\nat the top somewhere let me just find\nthat and um mark it down uh where was\nit I'm doing this off memory by the way\num I think it's up here\nsomewhere so yeah so there's a turn off\nlet's just say it's here um just for\njust for the sake of the\nvideo um obviously I do this in a lot\nmore detail when I'm actually planning\nit so um so I'll put that that marker in\nthere um so yeah so we've got we've got\nthe beginnings of a route now um again\nI'll go over this and I'll look at\noptions over and over again um you know\nI'll probably try going you know further\nsouth and basically just keep an eye on\nthat elevation and and that kind of um\ndistance um you might not want to go\nthrough a city or you might want to go\nthrough a city it depends um I don't\nknow if there's any band roads in\nlubiana um I don't think I think there\nwas Zagreb no lubiana is fine um so you\nmight want to write through route\nthrough a city just to to get more\nresupply um that's always an option\nsometimes you might want to um you know\nyou might have specific kind of\num like places you want to go to like\nbike shops or things or you want to you\nyou might want to have a big a big city\nso you can do a big like Hotel get food\num it doesn't look like it's any sort of\nquicker going that way through the\nthrough the through libyana\num so I think I'll just go back to our\noriginal 455 mile route I think this is\ngoing to be about right um just need to\ncheck there's no motorways um again\nbecause I didn't check the northern part\num so yeah let's just zoom in and\nbasically I'll just follow it along and\nyou can see that there's been some this\nis this will be a TCR route down here\nyou can see because it's just so densely\npopulated with the with the red lines um\nthat's not on the route is\nit so yeah zoom in there um and as you\ncan\nsee yeah that's a reasonable road to\nride and pretty beautiful as well um so\nyeah I'll do this most of the way along\nand I'll just check it double check in\nand triple check you know check four\ntimes you know sometimes it would a\nroute on the on the main Motorway not\nthe the Side Road it looks like it's on\nthe side road here yeah you can just see\nthere that it's on a side road again\ntotally fine to ride um there's even a\ncycle path if you want to do some gravel\nriding on the\nside um and yeah and as you can see it's\nit's put together a fairly good route I\nthink you can you can find tuna no doubt\nyou can well I know from fact you can\nsave save some miles um and um sometimes\nyou might kind of just shortcut a\ncertain Town skirt around a town go\nthrough a town\num maybe go to the north of Zagreb and\nget down the river valley further along\nyou you can see that there's many\noptions um so it's it's something you\njust have to play\nwith so yeah so I I think that's fairly\ngood for a route um a basic route anyway\njust oh I on my away here just check\nthis\none no that's okay that' be fine to ride\num so yeah um just go through check it\nand then when you're happy you just hit\nsave and then you do this as I said for\neach section between the checkpoints um\nmake sure you're you're happy with it\nmake sure you're not on any band roads\num anything silly like that that's going\nto get you a time penalty or get you\ndisqualified um I mean this is I've done\nthis in 20 minutes obviously I spend a a\nlot more time doing this and there's a\nlot more options um and you know it's it\nkind of it does it does take time the\nonly other thing I will do is um I might\njust highlight the actual CP sections or\nthe the parkour sections just so I can\nsee them a bit more clearly on the map\num so what I'll do is I'll put the\ncursor on the bottom of the um elevation\nhere I'll highlight all of that and I\nwill change the color I'll put it\nblue and then I know that that's the you\nknow I can't I can't tweak that tool\nthat is the parkour sector and then if I\nrefer to it on my phone I know when I'm\non a parkour when I'm not on a parkour\nI'll do the same for the start um so the\nparkour ends about\nthere copy that change\ncolor and there we go um so yeah I think\nI think that's a fairly good first crack\nat the route um so what I'll do is now\nI'll finish this video and then I'll put\nanother video out and I'll show you how\nI then split the route down into smaller\nfiles cuz you don't want to put a 450 M\num file in your GPS it just makes it\nslow and laggy and sometimes you don't\nload all the file on so I tend to do\nthem about um about 100 120 miles or\n200k um and and and cut them down um and\nthen I'll show you how to um put points\nof interest in custom cues um and we'll\njust do some double checks and things\nlike that so yeah thanks for watching\nhopefully that's useful and I shall\ncatch you in part two",

          "transcript": "[Music]\n[Laughter]\nafter 24 hours of traveling olle my race\npartner and I made made it to the\ncapital of Kyan which is located in\nCentral\nAsia I had a yearning to visit due to\nits Rich culture and Immaculate\nlandscape and I was so excited for the\nnext 3 weeks spent here how suril it\nfelt to be in Bishkek after weeks of\nmentally and physically preparing we had\njust one week to settle in adapt to the\ntime zone sort our bikes experiment with\nlocal food and hopefully do a ride at\naltitude to prepare for the race I was\nvery nervous for what was to come but I\nkept repeating to myself I'm here to\nride my bike not race I'm here to\nexperience the culture the landscape and\nultimately create some lifelong\nmemories good morning it is day one on\nthe Silk Road Mountain race our two we\nbike packing Adventure in\nKyan and we are just setting off to the\nstart line this morning it is qu to 8\nand we need to be there for 9:00 a.m.\nand all the Riders I think there's a 100\nof us will set off to do our 1200 mile\nloop around Kyan so looking forward to\nit don't get me wrong although I wasn't\nhere to be competitive and had no\nexpectations I still knew this would be\none hell of a challenge\nwhat w\nthat's\nweird so we are now riding got our\nlittle caps on riding so far is really\nnice just on these tarmac RADS so making\nthe most of nice paved roads before we\ngo onto the gravel\nand the mountain parties we've got ketti\npass\ntoday which is going to be really really\nchallenging and I think it gets up to\n3,000 M I might be wrong but yeah the\nviews are insane it is so beautiful this\nwas my first Ultra event and I sure\nunderstood how difficult the next two\nweeks would be covering roughly 12200 M\nand 30,000 M of elevation making this\nthe hardest off-road race in the\nworld we started a ketti\nand it is very steep I can start to feel\nit being a little harder to breathe\nbecause of the\naltitude so I've just stopped and\ncurrently waiting for olle I've been\nhere quite a while um I was keeping an\neye on him but now I can't see where he\nis which is a bit worrying I know he's\nfine cuz he's got a Tracker everyone has\nto carry a tracker on them at all times\nbut it's not looking\ngood so I've just asked a few people who\nwere walking and they said they saw\nOllie a quter mile back so I don't know\nwhether to ride down and walk back up or\nwait here after a hard decision I\ndecided to ride a little way back down\nthe mountain pass to meet olle my race\npartner where I found out he had\naltitude sickness at this point it left\nus in a really difficult situation it\nwas our first day of racing we came here\nas a pair spent a lot of money in hours\nplanning and now he was thinking about\nscratching at this point of time I felt\nso strong and really didn't want to give\nup now it felt too soon to pull out of\nthe race so we decided to separate and I\nwould continue the race by myself this\nwas a really difficult decision and I\nfeel like it really affected me\npsychologically for a couple of days\nafter just because I had my mindset that\nI was riding this route with somebody\nobviously I do a lot of trips solo but I\nguess it's the mindset you put yourself\nin and it took a little while to adapt I\nhad lots of thoughts and feelings that\nnight about the first day day but also\nwhat was to come for the next 14\ndays although I was now a solo rider in\nthe race I got to meet some amazing\npeople including this Russian Couple Max\nand Marsha all Riders were\nself-supported and would carry as much\nor as little as they\nwanted we've climbed so high this\nmorning it's 3\n,100 M now it's the highest I've ever\nbeen in my life I'm feeling good met\nsome really lovely people from Russia\nCanada and some various other places so\nit's been really nice sharing the trail\nwith some like-minded\npeople seeing as olle is not here now\nregardless of the situation I was in\ncomplete a of my surroundings I was in\nKyan in Central Asia probably the most\nbizarre but wonderful countries I've\never been to and I was riding and\npushing my bike up a\n3,800 M incline of ketti\npass these views are incredible\na look at that pass I can't believe I've\njust come up\nthat I'm nearly at the top but this is\nhard work and I'm feeling the altitude\nnow you could probably ask me why I\ntravel all the way to KGAN to ride my\nbike all day every day but at that stage\nI enjoyed the idea of challenging myself\nin this aspect you really get to know\nyourself on these type two\nAdventures have you got a puncher oh\nyeah I got it 10 miles\nout good afternoon\nit is 20 to 2 I still haven't seen\nanyone it's been hard\ngoing really challenging but I love the\nscenery and that we're actually on\ngravel rather than thick sand like it\nwas in Iceland we've got a mammoth hiker\nbike now up another pass this route is\nrelentless\nI am freezing I've got all my layers on\nit has been raining for most of the day\nso I haven't done loads of\nfilming I just want to find somewhere to\ncamp now good evening I am all set up\nnow as you can see it was a very wet\npack up everything is so damp and\ndrenched I got so cold in the end I had\nall my layers on including this which I\nwasn't supposed to wear whilst I was\nriding I don't know if it was the lack\nof food or the wet and the drop of\ntemperature I don't know day two proved\nto be very challenging with a couple of\nhuge mountain passes to cross that\nrequired hours of hi or bite then we\nwere hit with very unpleasant weather\nwhich consisted of cold temperatures\nrain and wind which sure tested all the\nwaterproof kit I bought with me\ngood\nmorning it is absolutely\nglorious it is so cold though I have got\nevery single layer that I bought with me\non right now I woke up to frost this\nmorning the grass was just covered in\nFrost and obviously it's been raining\nall of yesterday everything was soaked\nso um it was just not very\npleasant so I've actually come to the\npoint where I don't know if it's wiser\nto put on wet\nclothes and uh have an extra layer and\npotentially dry it out then not wear the\nwet clothes so gloves today were soaking\nput them on and they've actually kept my\nhands warmer than when I didn't have\nthem on even though they're soaked um\nand they've dried out really nicely same\nwith my buff and my hat and my\nwaterproofs so I don't know if that was\njust a common knowledge thing but I\nalways thought putting on wet pieces of\nclothing was really bad thing to do when\nit's cold over the course of the trail I\neventually learned the benefits of\nsynthetic materials it finally warmed up\nand proved to be a lovely day\nI've hit the\nwashboard it is extremely hot now what a\ncontrast I'm going to stop in the next\nhour or two and get all my kit out and\ndry everything like sleeping bag and my\ntent cuz it's still soaked the views\ntoday have been insane it definitely\nfeels very\nisolated um I've been solo pretty much\nall day uh I've seen a couple of riders\nand also had a weird experience with\nthese locals following me in their car\nfor ages I don't know if they were\nfriendly or just being a bit much but I\nwas just a little bit uncomfortable with\nthe situation this is breathtaking I'm\nlooking over these mountains now and\nit's very very\ndaunting what's to come\nit was very eye opening traveling to\nthese parts of Kyan where on the whole\npeople have a lot less but it was\namazing to see how happy generous and\nhealthy they were and if anything they\nwere thriving\nwe are nearly at 3,000\nM uh there's a group of four of us who\nare tackling this pass just to get to\nsong on Cold Lake where checkpoint one\nis or a day before schedule the cut off\nfor checkpoint one is tomorrow at 400\np.m. I can't believe\nit it's been such a great day I've just\nreally enjoyed\nriding and witnessing these views I feel\nlike it's not real I'll come in a\ndream might be the altitude to\nbe after roughly 5 hours of pushing our\nbikes up Calmar Ashu pass to Sono Lake\nwe made it to the summit at\n3,440 M just before nightfall to get us\nto kyan's second largest lake on The\nDescent a man on Horseback appeared from\nthe darkness riding alongside me he was\nshouting words I couldn't understand I\ncame to realize he was offering me and\nanother Rider a place to sleep at his\nfamily's year camp sleep uh yeah okay uh\nEnglish\nGrand come the family was so kind and\nput on a huge display of food a comfy\nbed to sleep on made of pelts and a\nchance to drink fermented HSE milk never\nagain all for a small fee which was so\nkind especially as it got down to\nfreezing that night and we had a serious\nlack of food\nstarted about 9 or 10 oh W yeah it was\nnot so good for the r and uh because of\nthis I honestly couldn't believe it when\nI arrived at checkpoint 1 at Sonu Lake\nafter a 100 m day it definitely\nmotivated me and gave me the confidence\nthat I could potentially make it to the\nFinish even though I had a long way to\ngo at this point\nit was unbearably\nhot there's no water\naround God yeah it is so\nintense M Sun cream I put on today I'm\nstill\nburning so I've got my sun hoodie on\nwhich is amazing Marino wall so it keeps\nyou relatively\ncool and it smells pretty\ndecent considering I'm definitely\nfeeling yesterday's a 100 mile ride it\nwas a long\nday I'm really feeling the heat today it\nis so\nhot just got some Coke and a n bread\num to raise the spirits there was no\nescape from this intense summer heat\nthis deserty landscape become harsh and\nthe lack of water points made it even\nworse this is no place for rationing\nWater Supplies in 40°\nheat hello hello\nhello I feel like I'm on top of the\nworld right\nnow the views are\nimmense it's just getting\ndark and\nuh I'm on the top of this path and I'm\ngoing to continue riding till I find\nsomewhere to camp\nwhy doesn't anyone talk about how cool\nthe sens are on this route it is amazing\nit's so amazing you hear a lot about how\nbrutal the climbs are but not how fun\nand amazing their\ndescents can be and look at this all\nthese rocks are amazing this landscape\nis constantly changing it's so diverse\nyouve got real Greenery you got trees\nand then you've got this rock it's it's\ninsane and yeah checkpoint one was\nreally nice really really liked it and I\njust can't believe I've made that\nMilestone and I slightly feel like maybe\nI can do this now I obviously didn't\nknow what the outcome was going to be I\njust wanted to come to Kyan and ride my\nbike and I'm just glad that I've passed\ncheckpoint one but I'm still getting 7\nhours of sleep and I'm still able to\nfilm and look around and enjoy the\nscenery it's not just a SLO checkpoint\none was a huge milestone for me if you\ndon't make the checkpoints by the\ndeadline then you'll be cut out of the\nrace I am now in the town of Kaden just\nput the name here it's been too long to\nremember the name it's been 40° today\nit's been baking been trying to keep as\nmuch liquid\nin uh got to this town like I said put\nmy stuff on for an hour because I'm\nrunning real low on battery good evening\nit\nis4 to\n5 and I'm really struggling actually\nit's just unbearably hot it's\n40° and yeah it's just really intense\njust finding it really difficult to\nbalance everything like right in the\ndistance sleeping eating washing my\nclothes making sure my bike's okay with\nmy chain rain and everything so I'm in a\nbit of a predicament like I said it's\n40° and me being very\nstupid I've only got 2 lers of water and\nhalf a liter of Coke and I've just\nlooked and I don't know when the next\nriver is and there's no resupply points\nand I feel very very stupid for not\ngetting any water at the last place\nwater hasn't been an issue so far and I\nassumed I'd be fine I'm getting slightly\nemotional\nbecause I was so desperate for water and\nI started to get really\nworried um I wouldn't find\nwater and\nuh I came down this\ntrack and I've already been down a truck\nto find water and there was nowhere at\nall so I came down here instead head\nand asked this lady I just showed her my\nbottle and they filled up my water\ninvited me into their home made me tea\nand food they made me emotional that\nthey don't have much but they were so\ngenerous\nand yeah that's really touched me\nI don't know if you can hear me it's a\nlittle bit\nwindy but yeah I got very choked up\nearlier um I ran out of water didn't I\nand I don't think I let on how worried I\nactually was there's no water around it\n40° and I\npanicked and I just really I felt really\nstupid\nand I went to a cut off I saw on the map\nand hoped there'll be water\nthere um and there was nothing and I\nheld my bottle up to a lady there who\nwas outside her house and she just\nwasn't responding so I filled up from\nsome swamp and it looked minging but\nI've got a filter so I was like oh I'll\nI'll do that and to be\nhonest there was a very horrible vibe in\nthat cluster of houses they were all\nmade of mud and straw the houses which\nwas crazy and then I went to another\nhouse and I just really wanted some\nwater and these lovely people filled up\nmy water let me in their home made me\ntea and food and we translated on the\nphones to be able to speak and I was\njust so\noverwhelmed how kind people people are\nwhen they don't have loads and they gave\nme all of that and let me into their\nhome and were so friendly and kind and I\njust it hit me like a sledgehammer just\nhow lovely people are and makes me\nrealize\nthat\ngenerosity goes such a long way and just\nbeing kind to one\nanother um just it's the whole world was\nlike that it' be such a better place\nthings definitely impact you differently\nout here because the highs are so high\nand the lows are so low um and even a\ncouple of Ls are admitted to crying a\ncouple of times and it's just there's so\nmany emotions and feelings running\nthrough you all day and you're alone\ndoing a big challenge with a lack of\nfood sleep and water\num so the real you does come out and if\nyou have any demons they're coming out\ntoo um or any baggage or things you\nregret and uh I think sometimes it's\npowerful and I definitely have those\nmoments where I just appreciate what I\nhave in my life and how lucky I\nam and how wonderful this country is\nyeah so uh\nhey\noh Max is changing his\njob the shepherd\ngo on if you\ngo go\naway it's like Clarkson's Farm but in\nKGAN\nat 22 years old I felt so lucky to have\nthese experiences after years throughout\nschool and adult life I found it\ndifficult to connect with people or\nsimply didn't understand one another but\nhere I felt like I knew the other Riders\nyears and there's something so special\nin that hardships and The Great Outdoors\ndefinitely bomb people\ntogether you know what\nso we made it onto paved roads which\nfeels like a luxury and we're heading\ninto the town of bof and I think I'm\ngoing to get treat myself to a guest\nhouse to have a shower it's been 6 days\nwash my clothes charge my electrics as\nI'm running low and get some food I feel\nlike I could eat my body weight in food\nI'm so hungry and can't wait for real\nfood instead of\nsnacks I didn't have dinner last night\nbecause we were going all night so I'm\npretty weak and hungry now and here we\nhave the little kids as you approach the\ntowns come up to the road to say hello\nit's so sweet\nhey hello hello\nafter spending the night in bet to\nshower wash clothes and sort my kit it\nwas time to get back on the\nroad we got you\nso good morning I haven't filmed much\nrecently just trying to save B Trey and\ngot with the\ndays obviously takes a lot to drive this\nroute and try and film and sort\neverything else out but anyway the\nhighlights of yesterday that stood out\nwas one I had a little bit of a\ntumble uh fell off only lightly I was\ncompletely fine just grazed my leg\nto got chased by a dog down a road for\nwhat seemed like\nforever um it was barking and it looked\nvery vicious and it was running so so\nfast um managed to get away I didn't\ndidn't really want to stop you were\nsupposed to stop but this guy didn't\nlook like he was going to calm down\nanother one was getting a hotel in bov\nare amazing got to wash my clothes got\nto have a\nshower uh night sleep in a bed charge\nall my\nelectrics it was a really great reset\njust down a path come down it we're\ngoing back up a hill welome to KGAN\ncome\nof course yeah yeah yeah come on so I\nguess you ate it\nbefore you or I ate\nit we have just crossed into the Border\nof\nChina got all the shipping lorries\ntaking stuff to and from\nChina we're in China baby\nwatch it thank you\nyou ready to drink\nditch I know imagine that good evening I\nam now in China which is crazy we have\nbeen on the highway for miles and miles\nand miles a lot of today actually so\nwe've clocked in some good miles today I\nthink it'll be over 100 time we finished\nthe Border went fine getting into China\nthat was all good you just had to had\nyour passport and we had like uh permits\nmade for us by the organizer it's been a\nreally lovely evening and tomorrow we're\ngoing to make it checkpoint 2 which is\ncrazy so we're still at over\n3,000 uh M it is very cold yeah so going\nto ride through the night well not\nthrough the night but for a couple hours\nin the dark got the exposure lights on\nfront and rear so I'm nicely\nseen and yeah just going to keep on\nkeeping on it's been a long long day set\noff at half 4 and the time is 8\nbut now it's\nokay well good morning it is a chilly\none we woke up here this is where we\nstayed last night the family that live\nin this trailer next to the Kiran border\nkindly let us all stay made us some hot\nfood and coffee this meant so so much to\nme it truly is the simple things when\nwhen you're out here on trail and you\ndefinitely gain a different perspective\non things and is it all like H hole\nwashboard Road it should be it's all\ngravel should then it goes to gravel so\nhopefully the road isn't after a good\nnight's sleep in the trailer and the\nconvenience of not having to pack down\nkit we left with full bellies to head to\ncheckpoint 2\n[Applause]\n617 miles in I finally reached\ncheckpoint 2 where I stamped my booklet\nhad some hot food and look what was to\ncome on the route which included the old\nSoviet road so that is checkpoint two D\nand dusted went there got some food rice\nand soup and bread some chai tea um and\ngot some Wi-Fi and just stayed in the\nwarm before embracing the cold now and\nhitting the old Soviet\nroad so we are now on the old Soviet\nRoad and we are actually heading\nup here which is going to be a steep\nsteep\nclimb we have now started the old Soviet\nRoad it is so steep it's literally like\npushing your bike up at\nMonroe this is going to be a long long\nclimb and you can see all the bits of\nBarb Wire left over from when it was\nbuilt we have just finished the climb up\nthe old Soviet road that was so hard so\nsteep the views are\nincredible and now we got a long descent\nwant to get off this high altitude I\nthink it's over\n3,500 starting to feel it a little bit\ncoughing the views were divine on the\nold Soviet road which is barely a foot\npath now the night set and I woke up to\nfrost on my tent the following morning\nbut as always it felt good to have the\nrest\ngood morning I've just got on the road\nhad a bit of a later\nstart cuz I overslept\nannoyingly but it is half\nand the temperature isus one my 10 was\ncompletely frosted this morning my water\nis frozen and I'm so lucky that I put my\nwater filter in my sleeping bag last\nnight I'm trying to pull out the\npositive\nof today because unfortunately late\nstart it's\nfreezing and I've just starting my\nperiod which as you can imagine is\nreally no fun I was now feeling the\npressure I would soon be arriving to in\nthe halfway point later that day but was\nonly left with 5 days to complete the\nnext section of the route with severe\ndiarrhea a period nose bleeds and colder\nconditions did I have what it takes\nthe bike still isn't the\nlightest that's the second river\ncrossing\nhe\ngood evening I have just made it to a Y\nCamp I really didn't know where to stay\ntonight I uh was riding in the dark and\nI couldn't find anywhere there was no\ndecent spots so I thought I don't know\nwhat I'm going to do I'm just going to\nhave to keep riding into the night and I\nmade it here the time is4 to 10 so I've\ngot a bed made up I don't have to set up\nmy tent and uh yeah I'm in this really\nlovely YT I absolutely love yurs and\nconsidering this is about 1010 to stay\nthe night or if that it's awesome but\nriding tonight was amazing I got to see\na lovely Dusk and then uh the stars were\ninsane but yeah I will see you tomorrow\nnight night on the morning of day 11\nafter waking up in this gorgeous year\neating my breakfast I realized my\nprecious time in KGAN was coming to an\nend already I'd created an abundance of\nof memories face learning curves met the\nmost wonderful people and I feel like\nI'd almost settled into this routine I\nwas used to being uncomfortable that it\njust became normality it almost felt as\nif this was my life now and that made me\nkind of happy just simply being only\nfocus on food water somewhere to sleep\nand riding my bike each day don't get me\nwrong I miss luxuries and real food but\nit felt peaceful just being\nand I definitely come back to this\ncountry for a slower\nAdventure it's so interesting how\nconnected you become to a landscape when\nyou're living amongst it witnessing\nevery sunset waking up at sunrise\ndrinking from its rivers and being\nexposed to all weather conditions I felt\nso present as well as connected to\nnature and all the wonderful people on\nthis journey Looking Back Now nearly 3\nmonths later those couple of weeks were\nabsolutely incredible and worth all the\nhighs and the lows I had the most crazy\nexperiences over those 14 days saw the\nmost beautiful sights and animals and\nultimately it was the highlight of my\nyear so I'm currently on\nMile 78 nearly 80 I don't know what's up\nwith my glasses\nand uh did 100 mile day yesterday so I'm\nfeeling very tired now and I just got to\nthe top of this pass before we kick up\nat 3,200 M and it's freezing so me and\nanother Rider are looking for a y or\njust somewhere to warm up because\nthere's been some crazy river Crossings\nand it's so quiet\nhe's so\ncold the rivers got my short soaked\nso it's\nfreezing and my my shoes are filled up\nwith water and now we got dogs coming\nthis way\nlittle German Shepherd hello boy\nhello uh\nyeah there was a man staying there alone\nand he kindly let us in into his y he\nwas a shepherd and spoke to Steven\nRussian about family his job and ask him\nwhere we're heading we all laid on the\nfloor in a row and was super toasty as\nhe lit sheep poo in his burner it felt\nunre to take off my wet shoes socks and\nshorts get warm and have some food after\na very long day the man kept offering\nchai tea biscuits apples it was endless\nI find it crazy how generous this man\nwas as it's not common in our culture\ngood morning it is\n8:00 and I'm just going up a pass\nfeeling very very weak today got really\nbad diarrhea I just can't eat anything\nlater that day I reached checkpoint\nthree where I resupplied big time from a\nlocal store I felt like a kid in a sweet\nshop and finally gain some energy it was\nnice to catch up with riders and the\nrace organization before heading on at\nthis point a big chunk of Miles had been\nridden putting me over halfway to the\nFinish however the terrain and River\nCrossings and the weather only got worse\noh thank\nyou oh\nM thank you\ngood morning probably like a right State\nat a minute uh I've got every single\nlayer I own on it was such a wet night\nlast night it just poured down and\nyou're looking out of the mountains now\nand\nuh covered in\nsnow you can definitely feel the tension\nbetween the Riders at the back about\nmaking the cut off we've got 3 days left\nthat's it 3 days uh the cut offs at\nSaturday at\n12 midnight all the Riders are just\ntrying to make it by then we've got a\nlong way to go but it's more the\nelevation that we've got to do everyone\nreally wants to make it because we've\ncome this far but there's a lot to be\ndone\nforee\nwe got two days until the\nfinish\nand yeah got a long way to\ngo I'm slightly panicking at this point\nafter getting this far through I didn't\nwant to give up now I knew I just needed\nto keep persevering because I'd be so\nproud of myself once it was over and I'd\ncome away with more confidence than I\ncame with sometimes when you get over\nhurdles and barriers and through\nhardships you come out a better and\nstronger person and that's why I knew I\nhad to get my head down and keep going\nit is so cold this morning it's frozen\neverywhere last night was insane it was\na bit like an emergency situation\nactually and me and\nMark we're uh walking up champy pass and\nit's not even a pass it's just like a\nhorse track and it got dark and we were\nwalking till half 11 I think it was and\nwe' just got so tired and you could\nbarely make out a track and on our\nGarmin it said that we've gone slightly\noff Trail but there really isn't a trail\nand in the dark you can't make out\nanything so we were like do we turn back\nback um cuz there was nowhere to Camp do\nwe continue on and just push over the\npass and we tried to keep\ncalm and thought we can't push on\nanymore we're so tired it's been a 90 M\nday and we're moving at 1\nmph and we still got to get up and over\nthis pass so we would have been going\nall night I think\neventually we found somewhere to Camp\nsomehow\nand what we were worried about and why\nwe didn't Camp up sooner is our tents\nwere soaked and our sleeping bags damp\nfrom the night before so yeah we camped\nup it was a bloody freezing night but we\nsurvived\nI'm honestly so\nknackered\nand it's just I feel really\nexhausted yeah I'm just I'm\nso\njust I think so L of calories\nlike\nasleep and the constant exercise\ncatching up\nand uh the route's just gone completely\ncrazy now like it's gone on another\nlevel so much climbing hi bike\nclimbing and single truck and now I'm\nstarting to think that I should have\nhurried up when the going was a bit\neasier\nblood I think it's going to be a late\none tonight I just need to get some food\nI\nthink I'll be fine\nman\nright\noh",

Laurens Tan Dem showed up in preparation for Unbound so you know this race is gonna be fast. \n\nI daily vlogged my time in Texas preparing for the event, and the family and I had a blast. But for race day, I was as focused as could be. I didn’t expect much from this gravel race as I’m still recovering from a broken greater trochanter of my femur, so I tried to just hang on and suck wheels. \n\nGravel racing is usually long distance on multi surface roads with basically a road bike but with fatter tires. This gravel Locos race was 150 miles, 250 kms and took the winner 7 hours to finish. \n\n\n//////www.Whoop.com /\nhttps://bit.ly/2UXZ8zN follow this link and use code \"vegan15\" to get 15% off any membership\n\n//////The best kits in the world\nwww.ElielCycling.com - code veganbro10\n\n//////Flowformulas.com\nCode dudebro30 for 30% off. \n\n/////Hella sick Shirts n stuff\nhttps://www.ridebikesbro.com\n\n/////Recovery Shakes\nhttps://kyoku.com/ (Code \"thevegancyclist\" for 15% off)\n\nfollow me bruh\nhttps://www.facebook.com/theVeganCyclist\nhttps://www.strava.com/athletes/180549\nhttps://www.instagram.com/the_vegan_cyclist/",

          "transcript": "we're a new man\n[Music]\nwhoa wow\ndude i was i was cracked from mile one\nhey so we're talking about the gravel\nlocos uh\ngravel race in hico texas this is the\nbike i'm running\n42 double cross irc tires on the canyon\ngrail apadura frame bag\nwith a bunch of goodies in there um the\nrotor oval ring\nthat's what i'm running really like that\nbike we start off in this beautiful town\nof hico texas it's\nsuper like old-timey the hitters\nthat are here are hitting dylan johnson\nhe's like\ngone on a tear locally colin strickland\nright next to me what\nuh ted king is here peter stetna\nlawrence frickin\nten damn is here so to the left you can\nsee me\nup front with ted king peterstedt and\nassam boardman i don't belong here um\nthis is from travis's camera so just\nreal quick kind of talk about my\nnutrition and fueling um i've got flow\nformulas in both my bottles plus a camel\npack\nuh and then i had a ton of cliff like um\nshot blocks\ni also had some gels and some other like\nlittle goodies but there's also rest\nstops here so\ni do plan on refueling at some of the\nrest stops\nnow the beginning of this race was\nneutralized right so all the pros\nall the big hitters said let's get to\nthis river crossing let's get across\nthat first\nuh let's not race to that because it's\npretty sketchy\nto be honest i mean the river crossing's\ndeep there's lawrence 10\ndamn what that's insane i was actually\ntalking to him uh he had said he had\nwatched a few of my videos\nmy mind was blown so now even though the\nrace was neutralized dylan johnson\nstarts going up the road following colin\nstrickland\nonly to realize that colin strickland\nwas gonna go p and so\nthere it is dylan johnson trying to see\ncolin strickland's penis\nso now we come down this little hill\ninto the river crossing\nuh in the pre-ride the day before my\nbottles had flown out so i was making\nsure that those were in\nnow they had two different ropes you\ncould go left or right\neveryone's trying to get through this\nhuge river crossing\nit's deep um it's super sketchy i'm in\nroad shoes\nand so the river rocks i'm slipping now\nif this had actually been like full gas\nracing here\nthis would have been pretty gnarly so\nyou know give it up to the event\npromoters for kind of making sure that\nthat was safe\num you know you think you might have\nbeen able to ride through it there's\njust no way\ni think there's a video of a guy trying\nto ride through it didn't happen anyway\nso\nnow everyone's trying to make sure they\nmake it to the front\nbut the pros here they were you know\nnot taking this like ultra serious in\nthe very beginning\nwhich i thought was really cool it was\nreally cool that i got to ride with them\nfor quite a bit\nthey really eased into it uh eased into\nyou know putting full gas down so you've\ngot a pretty good size front group\nobviously everyone's trying to be around\nthe biggest hitters\nof the hitters tons of female\nrepresentation here\nlots of talent just across the board but\nthen\nted king goes to the front he says okay\nlet's start ripping it\nand i'm on the front pace-lining with\nted king\nand peter stetna um this is just\nlike i just don't understand what am i\ndoing here\nto remind you i'm coming off a broken\nleg this is about eight weeks after i've\nbroken my leg\ni've taken a long time off i have tried\nto build my fitness back as much as\npossible but my expectation\nof how well i'm gonna do in this race is\na zero\nit's as low as it can be so i don't know\nwhat my body's gonna do i don't know\nyou know what i mean i did a couple crit\nraces the week before this\ni felt terrible and so right now\ni'm actually just expecting my body to\nexplode just like\nshrapnel everywhere but the climbs\nweren't very long\nthey were kind of punchy you know you\ndid have to have some power\nbut for the most part you know it wasn't\nwhat i had expected it was going to be\nin the very beginning but it did just\nslowly start to ramp up and ramp up the\nspeed just was going faster and faster\nand faster\nand the gravel roads out here in texas\nif you look back at some of the daily\nvlogs i did leading\nup to this they are really fast\ni mean yeah to be honest um a road bike\nis totally doable on this like maybe 28s\nor even 30s\num so i sort of felt like i had i was\noverkill on my tires the 42s\nwere kind of big for this um i think a\nlot of guys were running something\nsmaller than that but everyone here is a\nlegit hitter like right there that's\nadam he's from canada\nuh phenomenal rider so now the gas just\ngets turned on a little more and a\nlittle more and a little more\nand you know i'm kind of starting to to\nsuffer a bit right\nmy endurance isn't super bad but my high\nend is just not there yet after the\ninjury\nyou can see it's starting to get strung\nout it's starting to be a\nproper race and a lot of these turns\ndepending on what tire pressure you're\nrunning you know we're kind of sketchy\nbecause the uh the gravel on top was a\nlittle loose\ni felt actually really good with my bike\nhandling skills\nand so i was pretty confident in the\nturns which was actually surprising\nusually\ni don't but again everyone here is just\nstarting to ramp it up\neveryone wants to be the front everyone\nwants to make that front group\nnow this is only within the first hour\nof the race and you can see\nthe the pace is getting turned up so\nmuch that people are starting to fall\nback through\nand i'm letting gaps open so i'm trying\nto cover them\nin the turns this kid in front of me and\nthe green jersey on that mountain bike i\nmean\ni think he's got junior gearing because\nhe's just spinning out maybe it's just\nmountain bike gearing\nbut the kids doing like 140 cadence\nright to stay with the group\nsuper impressive i have somehow managed\nto stay with this front group\nthis long we're coming down this really\nfast descent you can see travis\nsuper bummer he was feeling great but he\nended up flatting double flatting\nand he was on the 32s on a road bike so\ni think he had the fastest setup\nbut he had an issue and so then we have\nhis chain drops i come up i push him on\nthe back\nbecause i'm a friendly guy right trying\nto make those connections he hits me\nwith a thumbs up\ni mount it on my wall i'm so excited\nthen he gets all mad because he knows a\nfreaking vegan youtuber is going to post\nabout him in a video\nso we roll up to the first rest stop\nalmost everyone waited\nand there was an agreement that we were\nall gonna wait this water i got gatorade\ntoo if you want\nthank you sir\nand now i don't really know what this\nnext part is going to be like so i'm\nkind of freaking out right\ni just want to stay with the group but\nagain the pros are racing\nso pro-ish right they know their\ncapabilities and so\nthey weren't being super douchers about\nit they actually\nblended the the fondo kind of have fun\nstyle with also\nlet's race really hard so i was able to\nget back on just in time before\nthey started lighting it up because\nthere actually is a group now ahead of\nus\nuh where they didn't stop at the the\nrest stop to be honest i didn't have to\nstop at the rest stop because i had that\ncamel pack\nbut i i just didn't want to break that\nsort of unspoken rule\nit was actually a spoken rule the day\nbefore that we were all going to stop at\nthat first rest stop\nand now it really starts lighting up we\nare just over the first\nhour of the race and it is just like\nstarting to be full gas i mean i don't\nreally know what's happening at the\nfront\nyou can watch dylan johnson's video\nabout this he was\nup there in the front he has a much\nbetter recap of what the act\nwhat actually played out in the front of\nthe race i'm just always here to give\nyou\nthe back of the pack perspective so\nwe're flying\ni'm taking some big risks right here i\nflipped the camera around to show you\njust how bad this is\nso it's fast i mean we're rolling right\nin front of me colin strickland\nwinner of dirty cans of 2019 uh turner\ndowner of\nworld tour teams i mean this guy's an\nabsolute legend super cool guy actually\ni got to talk with him a little bit\nuh on the race day sam boardman right in\nfront of me from legion\ni mean these guys are flying flying\nand i'm opening up gaps left and right\nbecause\ni'm vegan and you know what i mean look\ni don't belong here\nbut i don't belong here it's all a big\nmistake\nand now here is where everyone just\nlights it up and i thought\nthe road section was going to be the\neasy part and they are just\ncrushing it i mean they are flying and\ni'm just running out of gas this is\nhouston again please\noh here's so now what i need to do is\nbuckle down\ni need to put in my biggest effort i\nneed to chase back on i need to make\nthat front group\nyeah so it didn't really happen we were\ngoing for it but just didn't have the\ngas\nnow right in front of me keith legend\nthis guy was just on the gas i mean\ndidn't really\nask for much i mean he was pulling so\nhard and we were\ndangling i mean we maybe were off the\nfront group by\nfive to ten seconds for maybe 20 minutes\nit was so close\nbut here's a clip again from the front i\nmean these are the guys we're chasing\nand it's like they brought out 10 right\nof these real heavy hitters um all nine\nof them or eight of them are in that\ngroup\nso anyway so that's who we're chasing we\ngo some of this\nthis water stuff there's a couple of\nthose little water crossings\nthis guy barrett in front of me he was\nextremely strong\nand look i did well here because of\nthese two guys\nto be honest keith and barrett for a big\nchunk of the ride\nthey were doing 95 of the work\ni did pull through a few times i was\ntrying to give some encouragement\nyou know but they they were just such\ngood guys\nuh allowing me to sort of sit on my\npower my high end power is just not\nthere yet but i was really happy with my\nlike tempo\ni actually averaged uh 3.2 watts per\nkilo for the entire seven hours and 40\nminutes\nso coming back from an injury eight\nweeks out of an injury\ni mean i don't think i could have asked\nfor any better than that um\nbut dylan johnson actually did less\npower and did better than i did\nso now keith is just pushing it he's\npushing it\nhe's pushing it on the front keith is a\nlegend thank you\nalso did you know that i'm riding with\nrigor berto\niran tell me that's not rigoberto dude\ni mean like same helmet same glasses\nanyway\nhis name's really barrett but we'll call\nhim ricobert though he's awesome\nso again keith and uh and and barrett i\nmean they\nare motoring we get to the second rest\nstop\num barrett fixes a seat i grabbed some\nepo\nand we're off we're flying and now we\ncome up to\nsketchville 101. i'm straight having war\nflashbacks of slipping and breaking my\nhip here\ni did fall but i actually saved it\npretty well but then you come into this\nlike\nrushing bit and since i have deep\nsection wheels\ni'm not even joking i was 99 close to\nlosing my entire bike like it almost\njust flew off into the river\nthat was slippery so we make it through\nthat most sketchiest bit and then any\nriver crossing after that we basically\nall\nlike almost walked our bikes but then we\nsettled in\nand made up some time\nbaby\nso now i'm honestly kind of just\nexpecting to explode into\npieces any minute because in it feels\nlike i'm barely hanging on now keith\nhe just went hunger flat is what he\ncalled it i've never heard anyone call\nit that before\nbonking um he cracked he was doing so\nmuch work though\nbarrett uh he's on the front we've got\nnow chase with us he actually came back\nfrom the front group\num so this is the crew we've got this\ndude in the brown\nchase uh barrett and myself chase\nwas really going for it i think because\nchase knew what position we were in\ni didn't but chase knew that we were\nracing for top ten so he wanted to get\nrid of everyone\nhe kept throwing in these attacks but it\nis pouring rain\nand i can see nothing zero my\nshades my glasses are completely muddy\nthis is what it looks like if i'm trying\nto look through my sunglasses\nright and so i'm wiping the sunglasses\nbut then it's smearing more mud\nso then i take off my sunglasses and now\ni'm getting sprayed in the eyes with\ndirt\nand chases attacking and so i can't i\nliterally dude\ncannot see anything my eyes are squinty\nand\ni am just getting blown apart but it is\nthe most fun i have had on a bike ever\njust racing full gas for top 10\namongst world tour pros i've got snot\nflying out of my nose it's soaking wet\nbut it's warm and so look i don't care\nwhat's going on\ni don't care if we're riding through\nbarbed wire fences if it's warm i'm good\nand so we do end up dropping that guy in\nthe brown\nand so it's just me barrett and chase\nchase keeps testing the legs he keeps\ngoing hard\nhere's me doing one single pull it's\nvery weak\nbut this guy chase he was on it and uh\nhe was flying\nhe kept attacking and i was barely\nhanging on it was actually\ni couldn't believe that i was able to\nhang on like he would attack and i would\nclaw my way back\nuh but they did all the work i mean i\nwas look the reason i did wells because\ni didn't really\nput myself in any bad situations i just\nsort of ate off everyone's plate which i\nknow is like\nracing etiquette anyways we roll in here\nfinish line i can see in the distance\nchase goes i give it everything i have\nhe sort of got the jump on me\nbut i mean i honestly can't believe i\nfinished this race\nlet alone that i'm coming here into the\nfinish like maybe in the second group\ndude that's 10 no 10.\nlike a dead fish i was cracked\nfrom mile one i've just been riding for\neight hours crack\nthat was awesome oh it's fun dude never\nforget that\ni was on the limit the entire time\nso i don't understand how i was able to\nbecause you couldn't draft you're like\non someone's wheel and\nyou're just getting sprayed in the eyes\ni have so much dirt in my eyes\nso much fun so 20 mile an hour average i\naveraged 3.2 watts per kilo the front\ngroup here\nagain you can watch dylan's video he has\nbasically that but\nlawrence 10 damn soloed away colin\nstrickland got second\nadam got third everyone went really deep\non this race i am over the moon i\nhonestly can't thank gravel locos enough\nfor bringing me out the love i got from\nthe texan community\nand how many people came up and and took\nthe time to say hi to me\nwas honestly like unbelievable um\nand look i know that i i'm not a great\nracer or anything like that and\nyou know sort of my channel is not\nnecessarily about winning races\nbut occasionally i'd like to do well and\ncoming off an injury\nuh thinking that my whole season is\nsmoked and being able to get top 10 with\nthis kind of field\nbro it's unbelievable this event is\ndefinitely on my calendar from now on\nif you have time if you can make it out\nto hico texas next year for gravo locus\ni highly recommend it\nit's a phenomenal event anyways thank\nyou so much\nthank you for watching as always vegan\ncyclist\ndo the skin\nforeign",

Riders describe challenging terrain including steep mountain passes reaching 3,100 meters elevation with altitude sickness concerns. The Texas race featured technical river crossings that required walking bikes across with rope assistance due to deep water and slippery rocks. Gravel roads gradually increased in difficulty and speed throughout events. Equipment recommendations include 42mm tires, frame bags for nutrition storage, and dual bottle setups with backup hydration. Race tactics mentioned include neutralized starts for safety, gradual pacing by professional riders, and strategic refueling at aid stations. Course conditions varied from paved tarmac roads to technical gravel sections with punchy climbs requiring power output."
