      "length": {
        "score": 5,
        "explanation": "320-345 miles across Iowa places this firmly in ultra territory. The 34-hour time limit to cover this distance with no sleep makes it one of the longest gravel events ever created."
      },
      "technicality": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Mixed terrain with standard Iowa gravel and notorious Level B 'minimum maintenance' roads. While not technical like mountain singletrack, the B-roads become treacherous 'peanut butter mud' when wet, requiring bike-carrying skills."
      },
      "elevation": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Iowa's rolling terrain delivers approximately 15,000+ feet of climbing over the course. Not mountainous, but the relentless rolling hills accumulate significant vertical over 340 miles."
      },
      "climate": {
        "score": 5,
        "explanation": "Extreme and unpredictable Iowa spring weather defined this race. Late April brought rain, cold (30s-40s F at night), wind, and occasionally snow. Three editions were truncated due to weather; one year (V2) had zero finishers."
      },
      "altitude": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Iowa is essentially at sea level with no altitude impact on performance. The challenge comes from distance and conditions, not thin air."
      },
      "logistics": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Grinnell is accessible via Interstate 80 with Des Moines International Airport (60 mi) and Cedar Rapids Eastern Iowa Airport (55 mi) nearby. Multiple budget hotels available in Grinnell area."
      },
      "adventure": {
        "score": 5,
        "explanation": "Bucket list legendary status. Trans Iowa repurposed 'unremarkable' Iowa terrain into an epic adventure that changed cycling forever. Navigation by cue sheet only, 4am starts in darkness, and the mental challenge of 340 self-supported miles created life-changing experiences."
      }
    },

    "biased_opinion_ratings": {
      "prestige": {
        "score": 5,
        "explanation": "Trans Iowa is the godfather of gravel racing. Founded in 2005, it directly inspired Dirty Kanza (now Unbound) and countless other events. Guitar Ted is an inaugural member of the Gravel Cycling Hall of Fame. This race defined the genre."
      },
      "race_quality": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Purposefully grassroots and bare-bones with no aid stations, no course marking, and minimal infrastructure. This was by design - the stripped-down format was the point. Well-executed for what it intended to be, but not a 'professional' production."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 5,
        "explanation": "Life-changing. Stories abound of riders lying in ditches, cycling without feeling their hands, finishing in the grey cold with whiskey from Guitar Ted. The mental and physical journey created transformative experiences that defined participants' cycling lives."
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 5,
        "explanation": "Legendary culture that spawned the modern gravel community. The Trans Iowa Masters Program honored repeat finishers. The race created a brotherhood of hardcore gravel enthusiasts who still gather to share war stories. 'Radical self-reliance and camaraderie' defined the ethos."
      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Strong regional ultra-endurance riders including multi-time winners like Ira Ryan (3x) and Joe Meiser (2x). Not an elite pro field like modern LTGP events, but a dedicated community of hardcore endurance athletes. 100-120 rider field limit."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 5,
        "explanation": "FREE entry in later years ($20 for V1 only). No prize money, no flashy swag - just the purest gravel racing experience imaginable. Exceptional value for what became a legendary life experience."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Reasonable total costs with no entry fee, budget hotels ($80-150/night), and Midwest accessibility. Major expense was self-support supplies and potentially bike-specific gear for the conditions. Under $500 total for most participants."
