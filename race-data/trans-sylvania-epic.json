        "explanation": "Seven Mountains Scout Camp provides the central base with mandatory Stage 0 registration keeping everyone oriented. Sam Koerber notes \"The venue is about perfect for such an event, a boy scout camp surrounded by state parks and miles of singletrack.\" Stages scatter across Bald Eagle and Rothrock forests requiring some driving, but meal plans and laundry service handle the basics."
      },
      "length": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Sam Koerber explains \"The courses are generally shy of three hours for the leaders and as a result the pace is relentless... I went harder for three hours than any effort of any length since wearing a heart monitor.\" The 225-mile format over multiple days creates sustained intensity without crossing into week-long suffering, with individual stages hitting that sweet spot for maximum effort."
      },
      "technicality": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Pennsylvania forests typically serve up rocky, rooty terrain with sustained climbs rather than explosive technical features. Names like Gettis Ridge and Tussey Ridge suggest climbing through mixed terrain. Being gravel-focused rather than pure MTB probably dials back the most severe technical sections."
      },
      "elevation": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "The 15,000 feet over 225 miles creates what Mical Dyck calls \"constant false flats so you have to pedal through smaller rocks all day.\" Pennsylvania's Rothrock and Bald Eagle forests serve up relentless rolling terrain rather than explosive climbs, with the elevation accumulating steadily through technical rocky sections that demand constant pedaling power."
      },
      "climate": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "August in Pennsylvania means heat and humidity, but forest canopy provides relief from the worst sun exposure. The timing avoids spring mud season and fall hunting, though summer thunderstorms can turn things interesting. It's predictably challenging without being catastrophic."
      },
      "altitude": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Central Pennsylvania's Rothrock and Bald Eagle State Forests stay well under 3,000 feet elevation. Sea level lungs work fine here - altitude never factors into performance or acclimatization needs."
      },
      "adventure": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Multi-day stage racing through Pennsylvania's forest systems with evocative names like Poe Paddy and Coopers Gap delivers backcountry exploration. The scattered locations between different forests keep each day fresh. But without knowing actual trail conditions or remote factor, the adventure quotient remains theoretical."
      },
      "prestige": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Justin Lindine, Payson McElveen, and Crystal Anthony represent solid regional talent, but the field lacks the depth of major nationals. Crystal Anthony notes it's \"much more close-knit\" than her previous 1,200-person stage race, indicating a smaller, more intimate gathering that hasn't achieved major national draw."
      },
      "race_quality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Hard to judge what you can't see. No published course details, aid station specs, or cutoff times suggests either poor marketing or a race still finding its organizational footing. It's run by Trans-Sylvania Productions gives it MTB pedigree, but the gravel version feels like an afterthought."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Multi-day stage racing through Pennsylvania's Rothrock and Bald Eagle forests with named stages like Poe Paddy and Coopers Gap has potential for solid adventure. Spring Mills provides a small-town base camp feel. But without rider testimonials or course descriptions, you're buying a pig in a poke."
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "The \"Singletrack Summer Camp\" nickname captures the social atmosphere where riders call truces and \"just rode bikes and cheered on our fellow tryers.\" Crystal Anthony notes the intimacy compared to massive events, while one rider observes \"better friendships were formed through our five days of shenanigans than if we were all heads down, fighting for the podium.\""
      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "No published results or past champions list suggests either a small field or poor record-keeping. Being the little brother to the established MTB Epic probably siphons off the region's strongest riders. Regional Pennsylvania gravel racing hasn't produced the depth you'll find in bigger markets."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "The package includes meal plans with dietary options, laundry service, evening slide shows, and daily films according to rider reports. One participant notes extensive volunteer perks including \"$100 race credit, lodging in a cabin, meals, and race swag,\" suggesting the organizers invest in the full experience."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Multi-day accommodation at Scout Camp plus meal plans create the typical stage race premium. One rider drove 12+ hours from Atlanta rather than fly to avoid airline bike fees, while another invested in an expensive Orca cooler that \"never refilled with ice\" over six days, indicating riders budget for quality gear to handle the week-long commitment."
