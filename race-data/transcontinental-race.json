three four yeah\nwhatever\nthree three four lucky number I hope so\nI will need that luck I'm now waiting\nfor the bike chick really excited\nthank you\nthe Transcontinental race is a ultra\ndistance cycling race across Europe and\nprobably one of the toughest ones in the\nworld Riders have to create their own\nroute and it can be up to 4 000\nkilometers and go to the control points\nalong the way this year starts in\nBelgium then goes to Italy before going\nto Slovenia and heading into Eastern\nEurope towards Albania Crossing into\nGreece and reaching the Finish Line in\nThessaloniki\nso any words ready\noh you're never ready\nso finally the star of the\nTranscontinental race I don't know I was\nlike is this day gonna come it's so\nstrange to be here but uh yeah I think\nit's gonna be a great adventure I think\nthere's gonna be a lot of Adventures to\ntalk about but let's find out whoo\ngood morning nearly daylight\neverything ejected in the rain in the\nnight but somehow\nwe are keep on rolling\nfeeling good to be honest\nwas more race mode before\nrain pants mode\nvery hilly here\nit's more like Rolling Hills\ngood morning we are here in France we\nwere running out of water but the\nfollowing Ali found this Bakery right on\ntime so now continuing nearly 200k let's\nsee how the race goes let's do it rainy\nall day\nheadwind and rain all day\nhaving a deeper sleep I don't know\ncannot push the power now and he's so\nsleepy\nfeel like I want to throw up\nand it's like from Wayne's Highway\n287 kilometers\nall right\nthere without the rain jacket\nI was boiling and with this wind the\ndrug\nmy God I don't think what\nI know\norange red climb\nforeign\nhere in France\nraining not raining\ncycle Lane\nDutch Style\nwe're using recycling because we can\navoid a lot of up and downs in The\nVillages and traffic lights\nit's quite quick and it's very nice so\nnice for a change\nrainbow\nagain still taking a bit of shelter but\nI don't think he's gonna get better\nsoaked to the bone now\nDCR sunset\nsunsets are always nice\nI'm Karina Vivi but uh emergency baby I\nI like a bit more comfy so planning to\nstay in hotels mostly but you know if\nthere's a storm or something like that I\nwant to have an option to sleep in a\nbathtub let's say kill this race you\nstart in garious Bergen then we go\nthrough France uh arrive to Basel from\nBasel we have to go up a pass just to\nget to the start of the checkpoint and\nthen the checkpoint goes up this plugal\npass through a gravel road and\neverything and then levino so it's a lot\nof climbing maybe there's some storm in\nthe UPS so let's see\ngood morning day two we pushed it to 24\nhours yesterday nearly uh 885 nearly 600\nkilometers in 24 hours something like\nthat\nand uh yeah today we had a good night of\nsleep in a hotel trying everything\nbecause everything was wet and now Gary\nis ready to tackle the Hops on this\nalbum passes they do here he comes the\nelves but the bear is working well\ntogether\ntoday is the day\nearly morning\nI think it's like 3 36 or something like\nthis\nit's quite nice because it's quiet\nI like it like thieves in the night\ngetting every free speed we can\nlet's see\nbut beautiful\nAdventures\nthe Steep is gone Jesus Christ all right\nand this is not even the past\nwe are in the accent structure the part\nthat is allowed just came up the hiking\ntrail was freaking Steve and scary to be\nhonest I need to cry but now we are in\nthe artist Raza and then the proper\nclimb before the proper time\nthey got her\ntumale is a kindergarten compared to\non the way to the Gortat cortado\nhere we go the pass\nanimals\nthis is insane this is never ending my\nGod\ncooked\nCiao Bella\nit gets more and more difficult\nsaved\nsafe\nwe fall into heaven\njust when we were frozen crying of\nI don't wanna Rush\ning is freaking dumb\nso we couldn't sleep anymore we stay in\na hotel that we found because everything\nwas downtown was so cold\nand we try to try everything but it's\nlike a I don't know single digit time\nright\nare we going now Papas again so it's\ngonna be horrendously like\nI don't know how to cope with that many\nthe reason cannot be that long\nI don't know I I prefer that I didn't\nsee it scary all these channels and\neverything like a massive descent in the\ndark in the Alps I can't feel my hands\nof color breaking\na very\ngood morning I think\nday two or something again back to\nSwitzerland\nto the other\nAlpine pass again here we go\nhey I don't know some conflict\ngot lost\noh can you explain what happened\npass to belisona we were super cold and\nwe didn't have any food we had a small\nargument trying to decide on the route\nso it took us a while to figure out what\nto do so made it to the top of a bus\nabout to Bonk I don't know I think I\nclimbed out of here but uh really nice\nand there's more passes to come like a\nlot of elevation I know I think three\nthousand something like that\nleft or five thousand I don't know\nI don't know it gets harder I think\nthat is insane\nwe are going there\nhow's everything going\nfrom bonkin to freezing to freeze into\nboiling\neverything\nmoving basically\ncrazy\nI don't know how to describe this\nexperience\nI've been on that train\n[Applause]\nis his life from another world I will\nnever have come here otherwise\ncrazy like 2 500 meters of altitude air\nis quite in here\nfirst checkpoint of transcontinental\nrace\nfirst pair so far on pointy end of the\nfield and grow up bro to be honest\nthe conditions in the Alps were really\nhard during the three days there were\nrain and storms all the time with\nstopping hotels to warm up and dry our\nclothes we were doing quite well being\nat the top end of the field making our\nway towards cp1 we went through the Gold\nHeart instead of the double San\nBernardino like the race leader and\nafter that we made our way to livinho we\nbumped into some of the race favorites\nwhich gave us a moral boost as we were\nat the top end of the hill we decided to\ngo for General classification instead of\njust focusing on the purse preparation\nwe finished the route this week so let's\nsee how it goes there might be some\ngravel and Hiking so\nwe have our master plan for hiking so\nlet's see how this one plans out\nplan didn't work so we plan after\nleaving you to take a hiking trail next\nto a prohibited tunnel so you can go\naround the tunnel by taking a goat's\nTrail but first we had to get into the\nnational park and there were some\nberries and the lady there told us like\nyou can go hiking without the bike but\nyou cannot enter there with the bike so\nwe had to turn around lost an hour there\nand this hiking trail will have saved us\nthe stereo but instead we had to go\ntowards the stereo and we didn't have a\nroute for it so we just had a quick one\nwe did so there was a lot of drama we\ngot lost by the time we got to stelby we\nwere already exhausted\nfourth pass of the are having a really\nreally bad deep thin is all the stress\npanicking\nyeah it is what it is\nmade it to the top of the steel view now\ndown\nthanks\nfor touring boat I promise I'm not\ntouching the brakes it's just a win now\nyou go slow slow downhill\nstory mode 2.0\nday four I think\nI don't know\nI feel like I want to throw up\nlet's do it\nhow's it going I'm not good\nyeah really struggling since yesterday\nwaiting for the shop of the guys stay\nhere\nwell we know what's the problem no\nwe want to take the Euro Bello\nyou know feeling a bit better about the\nthousand kilometers mark\nit's really there\nit's really kind of the first Breaking\nPoint\nso now we are in the europello sunshine\nroute\ngrateful grateful for today\nvery much\nwe made it to Austria\nreally nice\nswim from the front\nthe shortcut was hard for his heart\nokay you want to say Something About\nSlovenia\nah really nice huh we are now again\ncycling\nnot that bad\ntouch Style\nsuper nice\nunbelievable\ninsane\nso beautiful\nso we just got cooked by one guy Nice\nShot he seem happy to catch us\ners\nwe are on the parkour it's a climb\nbut because of the wind\nfeels like a downhill\num\nwe continue to make our way through the\nAlps into Austria and from there to cp2\nwe are right there at night it was a\nhotel in Slovenia Slovenia was\nabsolutely beautiful and we were still\non the top end of the field we increase\nour advantage towards the second pair\nmaking progress\nparkour two in Slovenia\nfreaking Brute\nthe Parkour in Slovenia was challenging\nafter sleeping in the cp2 in a sofa I\npassed out there it was a hotel but they\ndidn't have rooms we started early in\nthe morning towards the parkour which\nwas like two in the morning it was\nreally dark and you start with a really\nsteep climb climbing for hours like 20K\nand when you think oh it's not that bad\nthen the real gravel starts and you're\nlike oh my God but we reached the top at\nthe Sunrise it was amazing and I started\nthinking it's not that bad and then\nthere was a really stiff gravel descent\nand I got a flat tire and I was like oh\nmy God's in the middle of the mountains\nnow what do I do I started screaming to\nGary on help help but he was Further\nDown The Descent as he is a good gravel\nRider not like me good morning just made\nit out of the ground parkour\nso cold and yeah when I thought it was\nokay then uh got a flat tire in the\nmiddle of The Descent of the Grove\nparkour but we managed to make it out of\nthere so now we have to figure out how\nto repair the tire but first warm enough\nwe found a Cafe open\nfive stars run on a hotel wind shade\na supermarket\nthe wind\nwhere are we\ntrying to make it to Slovakia and then\nBosnia\noperation\nCroatia we cross in Croatia I said\nCroatia\nmy personal favorite\nthe longest stretch between checkpoints\nwas from cp2 to CP3 so you had two\noptions you could go more by the coast\ntowards Croatia but sometimes you have a\nreally bad wind there that could be in\nthe wrong direction so we decided not to\ndo that as we did Bihar the year before\nwe went more Inland towards Bosnia and\nHerzegovina which is really nice and I I\ndon't know it's nice to write in a\ncountry that you know which is really\ncool the heart 2.0 now in Vania Luca\nhe's funny\nit's kind of nostalgic I'm painful as\npainful as we had I would say at this\npoint\nextremely tough to wake up\nTina was I woke up during a deep\nlet's see how the day goes\nit's gonna be hot\nbreaking progress\nand this is fresh here's some space not\nlike encourage\nCroatia was the same\nI'm happy we're not going through\nCroatia freaking win yesterday sorry for\nthe word\nhey\noh\nyeah\nso the good thing about Bosnia is that\nyou have a lot of\nfountains and drinking water so you\ndon't have to worry about not finding\nmood even in remote place\nokay I'm gonna put water\non my head\nhaving a really bad deep\ninto the night eh feeling good pakita\ngood morning we slept outside\nokay\nfive-star hotel but it is so cold now\ntrying to find uh the motivation to just\nget off the emergency baby\ngood morning from\nMontenegro another country\nso tough night\nneed breakfast huh\nreally cold there's not much around\nbut we're making progress\ngood morning sunrise in Montenegro wow\nAlbania\nhaving a break\nis insanely hot\nmy hands are ready\ntourism\nthis is like our adventure\nvery adventurous\nof the day during the hot hours uh found\nthis amazing hotel and decided to treat\nourselves to motivate for the\nparkour to come for tonight and the\nviews are amazing wash the clothes and\nfeeling fresh\nAlbania not my favorite country\ncountry\nat least they choose a nice checkpoint\nI'm about\none\nout of five today\non the way to cp2 foreign\nwe managed to get into the top 20 at\ncheckpoint 3. cp2s to CP3 is probably\nthe longest stretch then you get into\nEastern Europe when the race really\nstarts Europe changes a lot you go from\ncold temperatures into like really warm\ntemperatures it was around 39 degrees so\nyou had two options you could go through\nCroatia or towards Bosnia and\nHerzegovina more Inland we went through\nBosnia because we knew the area and we\ntook a lot of time there it was really\nnice and we arrived to the checkpoint in\nAlbania there but the checkpoint was in\nthe night and we decided to tackle the\nCP3 parkour during the night because it\nwas the toughest gravel parkour of\naround 65 kilometers and I had the\nfeeling I would have to walk the whole\nparkour\nthis year\nabsolutely horrendous\nI don't think this is\nyou can drive your own amount it's hard\ntrying to make it all this\nand just a more horrific power\nbut I can imagine\nit's over\ngood morning\njust made it I don't think foreign\non top of the world in a such a\nbeautiful country\nfrom Albania hey\nsleeveless grannies\ntry it again\nwalk the whole club for this 6 no 44\nkilometers\nthat's Granny's life but succeeded no\ncrush is nothing\nabout this because no fries\nanother flat tire\nand shitty roads I don't know how many\nSource I'm gonna get from this\nwe just hot enough over there\nall right hand says\ngood morning Dave I don't know but that\nmust be hopefully one of the final ones\nwe are in Greece our final destination\nuh fauna Bakery after riding through the\nnight\nI think it's five in the morning yeah so\nvery lucky and it's already 24 degrees\nso it's gonna be very hot\nI know in this race every kilometer\ncounts so much I even started to enjoy\nthe scents\nI fell twice this morning but still\nenjoy them\nthere's nothing here\nwe don't have food\nsometimes you have to stop and relax in\norder to erase it too\nyou're right as always I know I'm always\nwhat's the plan now\nso now resupply eat a lot and tackle the\nfirst parkour\nright insulting my phone back\nno\nso hold on\nI need to eat something\nat least I know what comes yeah\n[&nbsp;__&nbsp;]\nif you go ah yes they make you go down\nhere to then go back again but you want\nto make it slices\nhmm\nso what does she wants\nall that yeah\nfinish your parkour 4B\npetrifying\nbut yeah it's there feeling a way to be\nhonest and uh I think we are fifth\noverall in the race like which is\nsurprising I was like what\nso I will let you know let me know in\nthe comments if you think I'm in a\nmental state to say something right\nthe part of the race in Greece was a\nlittle bit tricky because you have a one\ncheckpoint but three parkours and you\ncan decide how to take the parkours and\nif you want to take more a gravel\noff-road version that is shorter or a\nbigger loop around that is a road and\nmostly main roads so after my experience\nwith pesh copy I didn't want to see more\ngravel so the first part cool was like a\nbit of some gravel that I was like oh my\nGod again\nbut uh yeah then Meteora was really nice\nprobably one of the highlights of the\nrace after Meteora we decided instead of\ntaking the shortcut of gravel towards\nthe next one we decided to go the longer\nLoop towards the coast which was the the\nbest decision that was what uh Christoph\nstrassa did also he's kind of like okay\nsimilar type of writer he likes going\nlike a fuss on the idle bars That's my\nkind of thing it was really nice to be\nhonest I really enjoyed but I was\nsuffering a bit with the heat in Greece\nMeteora\nepic\nthat's a long team on the move\n10 minutes\nyeah you called me in my good time of\nthe day\nbefore the dip starts so let's enjoy\nepic sunrise in Meteora\ncheckpoint\nit's so hot\nto take a break\nI can't see anymore\nsomewhere else to the last night hi\nI'm already getting cooked\nthis one I finished it 300 to go\nit is supposed to be a road race\nroad race\nI don't know how many times I felt on\nthis Racing Ground Road Race right\nI have nothing to do with gravel\nfive more years\nlet's push to the Finish\neven the way into the city\nsounds\nhe said it's about the Sun City\nso we finished those Continental number\nnine didn't expect that wouldn't have\nsaid it this morning\nwalking a lot but managed it was nice\nwe'd do a lot of driving\nfamous quotes of the trip granny gear\ngranny\n[Laughter]\ncongrats man thank you very much thank\nyou\nwelcome to your jersey\noh it started like that yeah\nit's a genius way to even out about\ncycling time yeah\nreverse it yeah no yeah\nboth raise reflections\nit was [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and it was awesome at the\nsame time\nagreed just break it right\nalso his reflections\ntough ride nice yeah it's beautiful\nJamie finished transcontinental race\nany thoughts after race thoughts\nyeah no\num I was ready to finish because I was\nthat's the hottest I've ever been and\nactually cycle anymore yeah I was going\nfor petrol station\nfavorite parts of the course of the race\nI think I enjoyed nearly everything\nexcept for the part in Bosnia that I\nplanned it's been like badly I went\nthrough South which was really\nnot beautiful but I really loved the\nhouse and\nthe\nMontenegro and Albania I actually\nenjoyed the parkour\nI saw a bear whoa it was passing like\nthree meters in front of me which was\namazing impressive I went up there at\nSunset so yeah\nwe are at the finish line of TCR number\nnine in Thessaloniki a long journey with\nthe winners of this year edition Crystal\nstrasso congratulations\nyou are an inspiration for all the\nwriters we were following yourselves\nlooking where you were going so I'm\nwondering how did you come up with the\nroute and what was your strategy because\nI noticed you went for the flattest fast\nrolling roads taking a Time penalty\nsometimes uh I think you put a lot of\ntime into creating the route right\num first I have to say thank you for uh\ntalking to you I'm a big fan of your\nvideos I've also watched like some of\nyour videos for Preparation like from\nb-hatred something really cool and uh\ngreat to meet you and also congrats to\nyou yeah thank you and your partner\nbehind the camera\num yeah regarding my my roots\num you know I'm like I'm not the perfect\nrider in the mountains and I'm a little\nbit more heavy than other people so I\nreally like the flats I'm very strong in\nthe flat section very fast and\nsometimes it's very it's much work to\ncreate a route a lot of food planning\nand research and and you have to like\ncompare Google Street View and Google\nMaps and Strava and promote and the heat\nmap and everything to find the perfect\nRose uh it's still you never find the\nperfect Road it's always just like 90\nyeah great and not 100 but\nyeah I try to avoid the gravel sections\nbecause I really don't like it they are\nlike painful here in the fingers because\nof the shaking yeah you can uh destroy\nor damage the tires and the bike you can\nmaybe crash um and when especially when\nit's raining it's I think it's really\nnot nice to write too much gravel so I\nprefer a longer detour on the roads\nmaybe a little bit extra time but still\num after riding\nsome minutes more I still feel better\nthan when I do the shortcut on the\ngravel the Ukraine is on debate at the\nbeginning when you did this double San\nBernardino how did you come up with that\nidea I was like everybody's gonna do\ntheir gold hair and then you come up\nwith like doing double some Bernardino\nyeah you know\num the one main road was was banned so\nit was not allowed to go along with the\nSea on the accent strata so we had to\nfind like a new solution and to be\nhonest there has been like one crabby\nsection on the east\nshore of the Sea of the lake and one\nTravel section of the on the west side\nof the sea and I didn't really find a\nlot of information so I didn't really\nknow is it good to ride or is it maybe\nhike or is it you have to carry the bike\nand um I've also talked to Swiss people\nand asked if they know it and they said\nyeah it's it's not so nice and there are\na lot of steps and and I have road\nracing shoes and no mountain bike shoes\nah okay so I was really afraid and I\ncould no no no no never I will never do\nthis especially the forecast was rain\nyeah and so I took the I think 100\nkilometer detour along the Rhine Valley\num close to Liechtenstein three cooler\nand they came to the parkour from the\nnorth yeah and until there it was really\nperfect Road really flat I was really\nfast and strong and rolling along and\nenjoying the road and then I came San\nBernardino from the North Heights make\nthe U-turn from myself that again but I\ndidn't not need to go over the court\nheart so from the climbing it was pretty\nmuch the same it was a lot more distance\nbut no gravel and no hiki bike well yeah\nbut I have to say I was surprised nobody\ndid it but me I think maybe a handful of\npeople oh 99 took the gravel sections\nalong the lake yeah did you do it yes it\nwas soft and rainy so you you were right\nif you were trying to avoid that and I\nguess racing at such a high level is\nvery stressful and sometimes uh you can\nmake mistakes because you are stressed\ndo you have a strategy and you just\nstick to your strategy to avoid making\nmistakes because sometimes you are\nstressed you want to gain positions and\nyou start making mistakes just follow\nyour strategy or what's your take on\nthat yeah in the first few days\neverything goes to plan but in the last\nfew days everything like goes crazy so\nthat's that's I think ordinary that's\nlike it is\nbut um\nyeah sometimes the stress is because\nthere is so many things to do people\nalways think okay you're alone it is\nlike boring it's just going along and\nnothing else to do but just right but in\nreality you have to check\nwhat about my food what about my drinks\nwhat about the mechanical stuff is\neverything okay do I need to go to a\nshop then you have to check navigation\nthen you want to try to make like a\nselfie picture for the updates or a\nshort video then you find out oh my God\nthe next parkour is coming I need to\nprepare myself then you need to stop you\nneed to change uh like the west then you\nneed to put the light on you need to\nreflective West when it's getting dark\nin the morning you need to get the stuff\noff so there is always a lot of things\nto do and sometimes it's really\nstressful yeah how did you prepare for\nthe event in comparison for for this\nyear I guess you learned a lot because\nlast year was your first unsupported\nevent you did uh I mean you won't run\nsix either but how how is your\npreparation now now that you have the\nexperience from uh self-supported yeah\nfrom from the training perspective it's\nit's still quite the same because it's\nit's always the same thing you need to\nlike write fast in one hand and write\nvery long distance on the a hand tool\nthe combination of some internal\ntrainings and some long endurance rides\nis still the same but the preparation in\nlogistics is of course very different\nand I think\none of the toughest things to do is\nroute planning it really takes a lot of\nweeks or months when you go in the\ndetails and of course always checking\nyour your technical setup so just the\nsmall changes you need to do last year I\nwas really completely new I needed to\nfind the right way for electronic stuff\nfor the lighting for the Dynamo\num and try all the mini tools if\neverything is fitting together and that\nstuff this year was a bit easier because\nI already knew a lot of things but I\nfound some small problems like I had\nlast year I tried to avoid this year\nyeah like the very small thing you can\nput on the on the tube and you get the\nair pressure on a gas station into the\nah yeah I forgot it last year\nso I have just a small frame pump and it\nwas pumping like 20 minutes and there\nnothing happens yeah and this year I had\nthis very small thing and on the gas\nstation like it takes you 10 seconds and\nthe air is there wow yeah and you're\nrunning this year uh Dynamo cup the\nsupernova\nyeah yeah how do you find it I love it\nyeah it's the visibility is great\nespecially for night riding yes\nabsolutely great and I really like the\nthe Dynamo because you don't need to\ncare about anything you don't need the\nbig like power Banks they're heavy they\ncan maybe damage or get lost so the\nDynamo is just easy and during the day\nyou can charge the phone or or the back\nlights or the tracker and all that stuff\nyeah and one question debate\nwhy tubes versus tubeless\nthe tree punctures will you go to\ntubeless next year if you decide to do\nit again or are you planning to do the\nTranscontinental place again maybe it\nwould again maybe not I'm not sure\nthere's still a record to me\nthere is always something\nbut the most important thing is\ndefinitely to enjoy the race and if it's\nif if you have fun doing it and if you\nlike really love it then you can do it\nagain it's not just about the result\nwhat is about the DCR that you keep\ncoming back and what is what challenging\num you enjoy the most because it's not\nall suffering right no I would I would\neven like it more if there was no gravel\nthat's the only thing that really I do\nnot like at all but this part of the\ngame and what really for me is\noutstanding in this race is uh you have\nthe the change in landscape and\ncharacter you're starting in northern\nEurope you have Belgium the cobblestones\nand the houses with with the Reds um\nstones and and then you go through\nthrough the Alps you have the wooden\nhouses and everything is green and then\nyou come to the to the southeast parts\nof Europe to the belcans there is\na different mentality in the people and\nand Landscape is completely different so\nthat's really exciting and also it's\nit's really an important race there are\nso many races out there but this is one\nof the biggest and I think and with the\nmost competitors and the strongest\nRiders and that's what I really love\nabout it\nplease let me ask you one question\num you did some racist solo you did some\nraces in the two pairs team yeah\nwhen when I watch people racing solo and\npeople racing in a pair it seems that\npairs are sometimes slower\num because on the one side you can\nsupport each other and help each other\nbut on the one side there is like two\ntimes as many problems and two times as\nmainly like you need to stop for the\ntoilet you need to stop to sleep\num you have you can have a crisis your\napartment can have a crisis so there are\nmore problems than when you ride alone\nso how could you do it that you finished\nin the first place in the pair category\ntotally agree I think\nimpair can be slower than racing solo\nbecause you have double the problems and\nwe had for example our dips in different\ntimes of the day I'm really good at\nnight he's really good during the day\nand we could never push it because one\nof us was always down so it was very\ndifficult we have like five crises a day\nlike fighting I even punch it\nuh I think actually we will be faster it\nwill him or me will go by ourselves but\nuh in this case we had a strategy and we\nsaid no matter what happened in the race\nit will stay in the race it won't affect\nour relationship and uh you can push me\nto the limit so you have to agree with\nyour boundaries and sometimes very\ndifficult to inflict pain in somebody\nyou care about yeah of course so in\nflick pain when you know they're\nsuffering like keeping pushing them is\nvery difficult but you have to establish\nthese boundaries I know it's just in the\nrace and no matter what uh it's uh\nexperience so if it doesn't go as\nplanned we are competitive and we like\nto to to push as much as we can but at\nthe end of the day as you said it's an\nexperience so we take it as that and\nit's our added bonus so to perform very\nwell and we enjoy the competition but I\nthink solo event performance events we\ndo like the short one solo because it's\nabout performance and the ones that is\nlike a life experience\ngood together yeah it's kind of our\nthing to do what about the the fan so is\nit because when I I was used to like\nracing Across America you have the\nsupport crew you have your best friends\nand you have great people\num when you're down they can help you\nwhen you have like best time in your\nlife you can share the The Joy with them\nso you're never alone you always have\ngood company yeah when when you're\nraising pair is it more fun because you\ncan share the moments together the good\nmoments yeah I think that's the things\nyou remember you have somebody that\nunderstands what is exactly happened in\nthe moment and then you look back at the\nmemories together as like a life memory\nthat you know no many people can can\nunderstand what you went through and you\nhave somebody that shared their\nexperience I think that's something\nPriceless yes because sometimes I think\nokay I had great memories and great\nexperience in the race and it was it was\nlike exciting and fun but it's only me\nwho knows the story I'm alone with my\nstory that's a little bit frustrating I\nthink it's more difficult\nhe had like a lot of\nit's like a fight every three three\ntimes a day or something like this one\nof the podcasts I was listening to the\ntranscounty podcasts you told the to in\nthe interview that yesterday you had a\nbig fight and today you had a honeymoon\nbaby I was uh screaming at here and\nsaying are you selfish and the next day\nI was like please cuddle me I need\nand then super happy in the eurobello\nhappy holidays so it\nUltra cycling is a roller coaster of\nemotion you discover things you didn't\nknow feelings you didn't know existed\nyeah yeah\nyou know the time\nany words about transcontinental race\nI'm not allowed to do it again\nI was told it's too dangerous",

          "transcript": "it's the morning of the Transcontinental\nrace and here we are at sign on we're\ngonna have a little chat with the riders\nabout their bills and exactly why they\nare the way they are so if you could\nstart with your name your cap number and\nwhere you're from\nmy name is P&amp;N Hut my cap number\nobviously number two because of second\nplace last year and I'm coming from\ntwisting in Germany your second last\nyear just won the transatlantic way race\nas well a hot favorite I think certainly\nfrom what we've seen here what's your\nstrategy going into the race to this\nevening well it's just wired as fast as\nI can and as long as I can no it has no\nreal strategy I mean it depends on the\nwind and the weather or how far I can go\nto tomorrow evening and then every see\nhow I feel maybe what the weather say is\nI mean if you have nice timing maybe you\nrecycle one or two hours more if you\nhave had in May you stopped earlier if\nyou have weigh in you stop buzzer it's\nyou cannot really really make out the\nstrategy in the beginning and in terms\nof the races that you've done here\nbefore do you have any distinct memory\nthat's your favorite oh there are too\nmany memories to be honest there are too\nmany stories I could tell things I have\nexperienced it's just amazing it then\nit's every time you know you have new\nexperience new adventure and meet new\npeople just fantastic and obviously\nyou're a very seasoned ultra endurance\nrider for the people at home that might\nbe watching this and thinking oh that's\nmaybe something I could give it a go\nwhat's your piece of advice to a\nbeginner it's a good question may you\nshould start with shorter ways not just\nthrough a Tavares with the transatlantic\nair was the transcontinental and whether\nto finish such a race I mean you always\nhave to keep in mind you have to keep\nmoving every minute you stop somewhere\nit doesn't get you to the finish line\n[Music]\nokay guys so if we can start off with\nyour names where you've come from and\nyour cap numbers i'm nico de portago\nCabrera I'm from Chicago and I'm cap\nnumber two five six B my name is Charles\nKristensen I'm from San Francisco\nCalifornia and I'm two five six a so\nthese guys are writing as a pair and\nit's not your first time that\ntranscontinental is that right guys no\nthis is our second time around so what\nhappened last year well last year we had\na little bit of a problem with our\nscheduling and we committed to the\npsycho messenger World Championships in\nMontreal Canada and this was our first\nendurance race ever so we got a little\nbehind schedule with some routing\nmishaps and got to the fourth checkpoint\nand realized we were not going to be\nable to make our flights to compete in\nthe world we didn't have the budget to\nreschedule so we scratched a checkpoint\nfor to make world championships happen\nfor us which was very bittersweet\nbecause we got a taste of the greatness\nof this type of race but then had to\nscratch with one checkpoint to go so we\nvowed before we even left checkpoint 4\nthat we would be back again\nand here you are fantastic so what are\nyou doing this year having done the race\nlashes any things that you've changed\ntest your setup or your strategy with\nthe route or anything\ndefinitely so last year we kind of\nrouted ourselves as if it was an alley\ncat race like all right what's the\nstraightest line to get to the\ncheckpoint and we'll go there cuz that's\nwhere we come from and in doing so we\nwound up cutting a lot of mileage but\nadding a whole lot of elevation which\ndoesn't seem as you know stressful on\npaper but then when you get out there in\nthe field it's like oh this is why you\nride a little longer to go around the\nmountain so we definitely were smarter\nwith our outing this year but one of the\nbig things we did this year that we\ndidn't have last year was having a\ndynamo hub to power our lights and also\nbe able to charge stuff while we're\nmoving we wound up having to carry so\nmuch extra gear last year extra battery\npacks wall plugs everything we would\nhave to stop so much more often so we\ncould charge things and this set up this\nyear will help keep us moving we'll be\nable to ride longer into the night and\nspend more time in the saddle\nyeah sure nice one and Chad's just about\nyour bike and you just talked us a\nlittle bit through your frame something\nquite special you've got there yeah\ndefinitely this is a low frame it's\nhand-built in San Francisco by a friend\nof mine Angelo\nhe started out building track frames and\nhe's gone on to some say real bikes but\ngravel and road bikes so this is special\nto me because it was built six blocks\nfrom my house by a friend of mine and\nit's all set up with a SRAM you tap\nhydro which is nice because we can\ncharge our you tap shifter batteries\nwith our Dino hubs so we're kind of like\na weird closed ecosystem of cycling\nwhere we're like very high technology\nbut also very self-contained and I kind\nof have a menagerie of bags but all\nbuilt in San Francisco by a friend of\nmine outer shell to kind of just make it\nhappen try and carry as little as I can\nbut as much as I need you've definitely\ngone for the sort of like the shoe Joe\npink glasses doping approach for me it's\nthe it's the little bit of motivation it\nhelps when it gets really tough to just\nlike have that little bit of color or\nthat little bit of flair to just remind\nme like this is fun this is like stay\nlight-hearted this is a shout out to my\nfriend JP from Tokyo and squid bikes\nthey have the idea of painting the shoes\nto match the glasses and I saw them do\nit for track lacrosse Nationals and I\nwas like that's my TCR jam right there\nso best of luck guys we'll be following\nin the jacket of course if you could\nstart by telling us your name your cap\nnumber and where you're from\nsure so Roger Seton cap number 34 and\nI'm from the UK excellent thank you and\nI believe this isn't your first cran\ntranscontinental is that right yeah I\ndidn't last you able to pull down due to\nfamily reasons quite early after\nFranklin 14 was killed and this year\nyou're not just gonna try and do the\nsame thing again you've come for a\nslightly different tact you got for a\nprompting tell me a bit about that well\nI said if I was ever gonna be us again\nI'd do it my most fun biking I have fun\nevery time I ride this bike also I smile\non I'm thinking getting on the bike in\nthe morning off for a long previous day\nit's good to smile so decided to do this\non the chapter 3 Bronson excellent and I\nthink what we've noticed most about this\nbike is obviously there's not a massive\namount of storage space so it's used\nvery wisely\nwhat are your little hacks that we got\non this one so first of all you don't\nneed most of all you've got\nwe gotta carry so very very minimal gear\nbut obviously the luggage here the back\nhas got the minimum amount in it we've\ngot things like Spears tape between the\nframes a spare tire just in case because\nI reckon pram tires are gonna be hard to\nget somewhere ongoing and that's the\nhardest thing ties in this year they're\ngonna be quite hot source if you wreck\none so it's basically optimizing all the\nspace for performance and making sure\nthat it's as light as possible\nstreamline nothing gets in the way\nnothing's falling off or rattling which\nis really irritating fantastic and you\nsay it's something you've ridden a lot\nbefore is it something that you've been\ntraining on it both especially for their\nlonger distance side miles yeah sure so\nI commute on one of these daily and I've\ndone so for five or six years now but on\ndoing this on the Brompton gone for long\nback-to-back ride so 300 400 plus\nkilometer rides and back-to-back which\nis the key thing back to back hill\nrepeats which you know brings a smile to\nclub riders faces when they get past me\nyeah just making sure you know you can\nyou can get the speed up so the average\nspeeds are a bit slower and you take a\nbit more effort but it can be done so\nmaking sure that ultimately can this be\ndone on the Brompton many can be well I\nthink it could be a world first best of\nlow but since I say thank you thanks so\nbefore we get on to this bike will you\nstart by giving us your name your cap\nhi I'm Renee I'm cap number one five\neight and I'm from Germany\nfantastic thank you and we actually came\nacross this bike before we spotted Renee\nwe'll take a closer look at every\nindividual part because this is quite a\nspectacular home build so am i right in\nthinking that although I can only call\nhacks on this bike you've made yourself\nis that right yes so I don't even know\nwhere to start let's start in front of\nus on the Aero bars here you've got a\nlittle compartment well if you got in\nthere\nI've got mostly food in there so this is\njust Clif bars basically it also has my\nmy backup light and my main light here\nand my spot tracker and small computer\nwhich I have for my power meter and\ninterestingly we talked about suspension\nyou've got both the canyon seat post and\na suspension stem on the front there how\ndo what's that one there it's a red\nshift suspension stem and I think it's\nreally important in such a long race\nthat you're comfortable on your bike\nbecause it's not about going fast it's\nmore\nabout the time you can spend on your\nbike so if you can stay for half an hour\nlonger on your bike because you're not\nthat fatigued not that tired then it's\ntotally worth it absolutely and sort of\nnot just the stories you've got on front\nhere but all of the storage I can't even\ncall the bags that you've made on your\nbike they're all made of carbon fiber is\nthat right yeah it's made of carbon\nfiber and this one here this material on\ntop is called Cuban fiber it's a\nmaterial which is used in in sailing\nbecause it's super light and super\nstrong yes great\nso in addition to the pack on the front\nhere we've got the sort of extended top\ntube bag also one in the back of there\nwhat's that one for\nthe one in the back is a former sleeping\ngear so for my sleeping bag and my\nsleeping mattress and I also take a bivy\nwhich is in my pocket from my tri suit\nand then there's some other really\ninteresting parts that aren't for\nstorage so you've got two bottle cages\nwhat are they for\nthey're for coke because your you always\nneed caffeine and sugar so I have two\ncages which are a bit smaller for normal\ncoke bottles which you can get at a\npetrol station\nI noticed we've got some aero fairing is\nthat on the Fox yeah it's just a narrow\nfairing to make the for that little bit\nmore aerodynamic fantastic and just one\nother little thing that I've noticed on\nthe back there by your rear derailleur\nwhat's that for\noh it's for my toothbrush but the one\nfor cleaning the chain and also for the\nchain oil\nthat's brilliant so when will be\nexpecting to see you in meteor I'm not\nsure yet because it's such a long race\nso a lot of things can go wrong and can\nhappen good if it all goes well I would\nhope for finished ten days for maybe a\nbit faster we'll see so if you could\nstart off by telling us your name where\nyou're from and your cap number please\nokay my name is Anna pettish and I'm\noriginally from Sweden I'm living in\nFrance right now and my cap number is 97\nfantastic now I understand this isn't\nyour first long-distance event but it's\nyour first transcontinental is that\nright yes so have you done before this I\ndid the length\nSweden in 2016 and I finished that and I\nwas fun it was very hard but it was fun\nand how long is this length of Sweden\nthat's a bit more than 2,000 kilometers\nso it's about half the length of what\nyou're gonna be starting this evening I\nfelt like I was in for a bit of more and\nyour strategy in terms of how you gonna\nbe riding and sleeping what have you got\nplanned for that I think I'm gonna try\nto sleep out as much as possible because\nthat makes me more flexible and but I'm\nnot gonna torture myself if I find a\nnice hotel and it's right on time I'm\ngonna take it fantastic and we've talked\na little bit about your setup and your\nkit what's your one piece of little\nluxury that you're taking with you and\nwhy I think I'm gonna take my name\npolish I think it's fantastic nice\nlittle perk when you're feeling low yeah\nexactly and obviously you're a really\nstrong rider having got through that the\nlength of Sweden is not easy at all\nespecially with those weather conditions\nwhat do you do to prepare not\nnecessarily on the bike but mentally for\nwhen you're having a bit of a struggle\nwhen things get tough that is gonna get\nbetter because I know from touring solo\nall the time and doing everything myself\nI know that I can work through it I just\nneed a calm moment use my brain think\nabout it and then I know I will be fine\nin the end and it's it's just me biking\nand it's only a bike race and that's it\nso and we have 21 women on the start\nline this year out of 240 why do you\nthink that is and why aren't there more\nwomen here I think it's a lot about the\npreconceived ideas that a lot of women\nhave in themselves that being alone on\nthe road with a bike meeting people\nbeing afraid of being alone meeting\npeople and of course stuff can happen\nbut I think most people generally are\nkind and they want good for you and you\nshould have that closest to your heart\nand not be afraid\nI think that's one of the reasons that\nthere is less ladies but it's really not\nthat bad and you just have to trust\nyourself and that you can do it and you\ncan solve all the technical stuff but\nbasically those people around you are\nkind so here we are with Janice's bike\nyeah this is from Greece so it's\nessentially a ride home for him and\nunderneath this really stunning paint\nwhich Anstead himself is a true British\nclassic there's a hercules and it's\nactually got a custom-made fork there\nfor this bike it comes complete with a\nShimano ta grow group set so a little\nmore modern they're full aperture a bike\npacking bags and a very comfortable\nBrook saddle and some really sweet\nlittle finishing details flip-flops on\nthe top there there's some time off the\nbike and also a lucky charm on the front\nfrom one of his friends back home so\nYanis we're just over 24 hours before\nthe start now before you ride home back\nto Greece how are you feeling about this\nI'm exciting it's my first time here and\nit's amazing to be here for me because I\nshow this race years now and it was my\ndream to to be part of this race\nfantastic and and the build-up to this\nrace have you been doing lots of long\ndistance bike rides maybe at any other\nevents in the build-up to it I know I'm\na long-distance cyclist and it's my\nfirst time to go and race in race mode\nall my trips it's its classic with\nclassic pioneers with my classic bike\nthat's it maybe on your own oh yeah oh\nand so to be here in Harrodsburg and\nwith all these people who are into the\nsame sort of thing into this\nlong-distance atmosphere how does that\nfeel it's it's something new for me\nsomething new yeah absolutely yeah yeah\nwell best of luck we'll be watching\nso that's just a fraction of the riders\nand their setups from this year's\ntranscontinental race and all there's\nleft to do now is to see them off going\nup the mule and then follow their\nprogress over the next couple of weeks\nif you'd like to check out more from our\ntrip to the Transcontinental click just\ndown here and don't forget to subscribe",

The route changes every year but it's always extremely difficult, beautiful, and very rewarding.\n\nI raced the 2022 Buckshot, but a foolish crash at the mid-way point broke my camera, and I could not finish documenting the ride. One of my goals going into this year's event was to try and continuously record what was happening and how I was feeling.

He explores Innovation in Cycling by speaking about Mike Hall, the founder of The Transcontinental Race. Mr M Broadwith is known as a long-distance specialist, having won the National 24 Hour time trial no less than three times, with distances up to 530 miles. Not only this, but his fantastic record for the “End to End”: Land’s End to John O’Groats was completed on 17th June 2018 in a staggering time of 43 hours, 25 minutes and 13 seconds. In August 2022, Mr Broadwith competed in The Transcontinental Race No. 8, and is an inspiration to us all by persevering in this self-supported bicycle race across Europe.

          "transcript": "foreign\n[Music]\nin terms of thinking about events\nthinking about things that you can do\nand actually I think the message that I\nwanted to give to people is to be brave\nenough to not always tread the normal\npath\nso I'm going to talk today very briefly\nabout Mike Hall and something called the\nTranscontinental this chat here is Mike\nHall\nhe talked about inspiration of the Tour\nde France of yesteryear we've got a\nphoto here of the Tour de France when it\nwas first started to make headlines\naround the world it was a journey across\nFrance and it was very much an element\nof self-sufficiency and of Adventure you\nmay have seen clips of people stopping\nby a boulangerie running in grabbing\nbread rolls and getting back on their\nbikes again or even in the most extreme\ncases of stopping at blacksmiths and\nhaving to repair their own bikes\nwhen might Hall\num got into cycling and then when he was\nwatching it in the early 2000s the Tour\nde France was a very different thing\nindeed chap on the left is Lance\nArmstrong who won a lot of Tour de\nFrance\num but then it was found out that he\nwasn't actually quite all that he was\ncracked up to be and I think what Mike\nall felt was a worry that we traveled\naway from those initial goals and it was\nbecoming something very different and he\nwanted to look for something he wasn't\ngetting out of that what he wanted from\nthe sport\nso he looked for a different type of\ncycling\nand he was doing what's now called long\ndistance Ultra racing he did a couple of\nevents called the tour divide and also\nthe TransAmerica bike race\nthis is the tour divide which goes from\nBanff in Canada all the way down the\ngreat Continental Divide to the Mexican\nborder\nas you can see four and a half thousand\nkilometers and he's still currently the\nrecord holder for that route which is\ndone on mountain bikes and he did it in\njust under two weeks and that happens\nevery year\nthe TransAmerica bike race goes the\nother way if you like you might have\nheard of the Race Across America but the\nway that Michael does his events is that\nyou have to be totally self-sufficient\nand you'll notice that all of these\nbikes that you're seeing photos of carry\nbags and have equipment with them that\nmeans that people need to do everything\nthemselves they need to choose where\nthey're going to sleep they need to\nchoose what they're going to eat and\nthey need to completely provide for\nthemselves the idea to kind of go back\nto how things used to be\num in the good old days\nso he founded What's called the\nTranscontinental he took those ideas\nthat he'd seen in America and he brought\nthem over to Europe with a little bit of\na twist all of the events that he'd done\nin America had what are called what\nfixed route events but he wanted to\ncombine those long distance fixed Street\nevents with elements of orienteering so\nrather than telling people which way\nthey had to go just give them a number\nof checkpoints that they had to visit on\ntheir journey across Europe\nand so there's a little bit of blurb\nthere talking about what his fundamental\nVision was in terms of creating this\ndream his Innovation if you like\nit's a single stage race in which the\nclock never stops and it's 4 000\nkilometers across Europe\nI'll let you just read that\nso in 2013 you organized the first\ntranscontinental race and that was a\ngroup of about 60 people who gathered\ntogether in London and they only had two\ncheckpoints that they had to visit on\ntheir way to Istanbul they firstly\nneeded to go to garage Bergen in Belgium\nwhich is a very famous place in Flanders\nwith a lot of cycling history and then\nalso visit stelvio pass in Northern\nItaly before going on to Istanbul and it\nwas won by this chap here Christoph\nalligat who's a teacher from Belgium who\nhad no idea that this was the kind of\nthing that he was going to be good at\nturns out he's absolutely fantastic at\nit and you can talk to him you can\nlisten to him and decide which of those\nattributes of his makes him good at this\nparticular type of racing but it took\nhim just seven days and 13 hours to\ncycle from London to Istanbul\nI think people were attracted by the\nkind of Back to Basics uh element and\nthe success of the Transcontinental grew\nand grew and within two years they were\ntaking four or five times as many\napplications as they were offering\nplaces on the race\ntwo years later they had so one year\nlater they added another couple of\ncheckpoints this time via Paris and also\nsomewhere in Montenegro and they started\nto take the route which was primarily\ndesigned for road bikes slightly off off\ncourse as you can see there this is\ngoing across the high mountains of\nMontenegro but again Christoph alligat\ncame back from Belgium and won it again\nfor a second year\ncarrying on from there\nuh you can see now they've established\nformat the next three years and that\npopularity had been founded so Michael\nhad found his Niche he was now I think\nmost people would argue the organizer of\nthe world's Premiere uh bike packing\nrights\nI think it was a feeling he'd come from\na position of being the best and he'd\nnow created especially this chat Crystal\nGallagher he thought he was the best as\nwell and there was a moment then in 2017\nwhere both of them entered a new race\nwhich was called the Indian Pacific\nwheel race in Australia\nI'll come back to that in a second but\nfirstly I just wanted to show you and I\nhope this will work a short clip from\nthe start of the Transcontinental race\nthe Transcontinental race shows its\nposition for beginning now in garage\nBergen in Belgium they start at 10 p.m\nat night so uh what Michael would\ndedicated to Simplicity he wanted to\ndesign a race or you could put the whole\nrules of the race just on one piece of\npaper which is what he did here\nthen he went with Christoph alligator to\nAustralia there's a tour that might fall\non the left elegant on the right and\nthey competed in the Indian Pacific\nwheel race it was a really interesting\nrace to watch and what it summed up is\nwhy this kind of racing is perfect for a\nmodern generation because plenty of\npeople who watch these races from the\ncontent of their own from the safety of\ntheir own home every Rider has a tracker\non their bike and you can load up a map\nand you can watch where the Riders are\nand essentially thousands and thousands\nof people were watching might call it\nalligator racing across Australia the\nproblem was alligators faster Michael\nwas in front and every day alligator was\ncatching him and the only thing that\nMichael could do was choose to have less\nand less sleep every day but Australia\nis a very very big place and as he was\nclosing in on him they're 500 kilometers\nto go until they got to Sydney so\nthey've got all the way over here\nthey've already gone through Melbourne\nthey're cutting their way up towards\nSydney and the media Court have got this\nfootage from the middle of the night\nthat's Christoph alligat closed\ncaptioning not available\nwrote to within 500 meters of the finish\nline which was a Sydney Opera house but\ndecided it wasn't appropriate to finish\nso posted this photo on social media and\nthen went home\nlater on they organize a tribute at the\nopera house and you can see Alec out\nthere placing flowers which was attended\nby over 2 000 members of the Sydney\ncycle Community the Transcontinental\nrace continues to the day on the left is\nMike Hall's partner at the time Anna\nhaslov she now organizes the event and\non the right it's the only cold Winger\nfrom Germany who won the event last year\nbecoming the first female Rider to win\nan international standard long distance\nevent this year's transcontinental race\nstarts in two and a half weeks time from\ngarage Bergen in Belgium and those\nthrough these four checkpoints to finish\nat Burgos in Romania if you're\ninterested I'm sure that you can look\nonline and see the Riders as they follow\ntheir route across Europe with the\nwinner probably expected to complete\nparticularly hard course this year in\nabout eight days time\nthanks very much for listening",

Key challenges include the extremely steep and scary Splugen Pass accessed via hiking trail, and multiple Alpine climbs with potential storm conditions. Terrain varies from rolling hills to gravel mountain passes, with some Dutch-style cycle lanes available to avoid village traffic. Weather conditions include persistent rain, headwinds, and variable mountain weather. Successful riders emphasize the importance of continuous movement, smart routing around mountains rather than straight-line approaches, and proper gear including dynamo hubs for charging devices. The race demands both physical endurance and strategic route planning across diverse European terrain and weather conditions."
