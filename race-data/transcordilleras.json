          "description": "Endurance adventurers Mark and Caroline Livesey return to Colombia for their second time to tackle this epic eight-day gravel race.  Transcordilleras, Colombia, is without doubt one of the most gruelling gravel stage races in the world. \n\nFrom extreme weather to never-ending mountain passes, some over 4000m in altitude, each day pushes their limits physically and mentally in jaw-dropping landscapes.  Alongside the pain, a familiar theme emerges: the joyous hospitality of the Colombian people. \n\nOn and off the gravel, this film highlights how Colombians—proud, welcoming, and endlessly resourceful—empower the riders. Whether helping fix punctures at roadside shops or improvising mechanical solutions in remote locations, their generosity becomes the emotional backbone of the competition. Both the Colombian competitors and the locals along the route inject kindness, which creates a unique experience for the riders. \n\nBeyond the landscape, the documentary reveals a deep camaraderie among the competitors. Bonding through shared struggles, riders from around the globe—from professional cyclists to weekend warriors—form friendships that will endure long after the finish line.",

          "transcript": "I don't think there's any doubt we\nweren't going to come back. We forgot\nthe pain almost immediately from\ntranscodalis which was last year 2024.\n[Music]\nThis one\nagain.\n[Applause]\nThe amazing thing about this race is\nevery year they completely change the\nroute. So it was like it's just the\nperfect excuse to come back to Colombia,\nexplore more of the country and\num and enjoy the race again. Last year\nthey got the wrong\nflag for me and I got really crossed cuz\nit was English. They had an English flag\non my number.\nUh so this year they made sure they had\nthe Scottish flag but they but they also\ngave it to Mark. So both Scottish.\nHola.\nWe're just starting\nthe ride to the ride.\nTwo miles to the start. It's uphill.\nTrying to ride as soft as possible.\nAnd uh I've told myself this morning\nwhen everybody [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] off and goes like\n[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] off a stick, I'm not going to make\nthe same mistake I did in Cross Andes.\nI'm just going to ease into this climb.\nAnd hopefully I'll catch Lord at the\ntop. That's the plan. I mean, do you\neven think that's a reasonable\nexpectation for you?\nYeah. Given your track record of No, I\ncuz I think back when I was first 16\nhours of the Cross Andes, I felt\ndreadful. Okay. And that's because I\nwent too hard. Yeah. The first two hours\nand I paid the price. So keep that in\nyour mind as you're setting off today.\nthe friends that we met last year,\npretty much all of them were here again.\nSo, we had this rebonding uh this sort\nof sense of um comradeship\nsense that we're going to share these\neight days of purgatory, pain,\nsuffering, and the elation finishing\nevery day and then talking about\nafterwards.\nLike I know\nyou have a good day. Hey. You okay,\nBrian? How are you? Yeah, good. You?\nVery good. You're looking fit, my\nfriend. Thanks, man. You're looking\nreally lean. Thanks, bro. You must weigh\nwhat? Maybe 15 kg. 55. 55. Holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]\n55. When I weighed 55, I was maybe 12\nyears old.\nYou're going to rock. I know you are.\nBut see you later, my friend.\nAnd eat some more.\nI think in transcodieras you almost see\nmore of Colombia than a lot of the\nColombian people have seen.\nThe race was created by a group of\nfriends who wanted to give people that\nexperience of riding gravel and road in\nparts of Columbia they would not\nnormally go to.\nAnd it's why we enjoy it so much.\nCheck out that view.\nThink I'm going to put me on. It's bit\ncold, isn't it? It's a bit chilly up\nhere.\nWe'll get into that. And this is that\nblack cloud there is why we come early\nbecause the paramo\nyou do get rain in the afternoons. I can\nactually see Lake Ta. You see it? Where?\nThis year Transcord RS was different.\nIt was slightly shorter about just under\n900 km.\nBut we also went up into the Paraml. We\nhad more high altitude riding which\ncreated its own challenges. The Paramo\nin Colombia is mountains that have that\nare above 3,000 m and they have a very\nspecial flora and fauna. The climate is\ndifferent. It's much cooler up there.\nAnd obviously on a bike, cycling at\nthose altitudes is much more difficult.\nBeen riding 5 and a half hours. I've\nalready done 72ks.\nIt took me 3 hours to do the climb.\nAnd today is one of those days where\nit's just been purgatory. My body is\njust not playing today. door.\nI remember having a bad day last time,\nbut it wasn't the first day.\nSo, I'm hoping this is my only bad day.\nIt's just so hard. Oh, it's so\nfrustrating.\nThe gravel is so rough. Even descending\nis exhausting.\nWe're in the paramore now, which is\nabove Well, we're at 3,500\nm. And we actually ride\nabout 80k through this. I'm in the\nclouds. It's cool, which is good, man.\nLooked at my garment and it said 72K.\n[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hell.\nOh, yeah. Last year we didn't see any\nmud. Today it's been muddy. Really\nmuddy.\nIt's when you've got to really\nrely on your bike. It's full of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]\nman. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] dying.\nOne of the challenges this year was the\nfirst day we went up into the Paramo.\nAnd we didn't just visit the Paramo and\ncome back down again. We were up there\nfor 80 kilometers of high altitude\nriding. And that was a real challenge\nwhen you're riding altitude for a long\nperiod of time and you're not fully\nadjusted. I mean, we'd been in Columbia\nfor a couple of weeks before the race.\nAnd we'd stayed at altitude. We'd been\nstaying up at 2,600 m. And we'd been\nriding up into these high altitude\nareas, but we hadn't been staying there\nfor long periods of time. And for the\nfirst couple of hours at altitude on\nthat first day, I was fine. Amazing\nclimb, right? Amazing climb.\nBut we've been climbing for 23k\nsolid. But as you stay there for longer,\nit takes more of a toll on your body. I\nstarted to get a really bad headache.\nAnd then I started to have really bad\nnausea.\nJust had to stop and give my body a\nchance to catch up because\nI am really struggling. I've got really\nbad nausea.\nFeel like I'm going to black out.\nlike 1 kilometer. I'm I'm climbing all\nthe time, like all the time. And 1 km\nfeels like\nreally\nherculean effort now.\nSo,\nI'm on a climb which has got\n4K to go\nand I'm going to have to rest on my way\nup here because\nyeah, it's finishing me off. I'm at\nabout 90k, so 40k to go.\nAnd hopefully some of that is downhill.\nWe'll see.\nTomorrow's a new day. We'll get all\nwe'll get back, get washed, change. Do\nyou want to get something from the\nchemist?\nYour stomach.\nIt's four miles to the hotel.\nI get a taxi\noxygen saturation. Yes. Yeah, that's\nlow. My my resting heart rate is really\nhigh. That's nearly 70. No.\nwas great.\nTranscords has a group of medics that\nare with the race. Sophia, one of the\nmedics, was fantastic with me. She came\nand checked all my vitals when I was\nbeing sick. And the next morning, she\nwas like, \"Well, I'm going to make sure\nthat you're okay to ride. I need to\ncheck check up on you. Check your\nvitals. Make sure you've eaten. Make\nsure you haven't been sick in the night.\nUm, if I'm going to let you ride again,\nbecause altitude sickness can can be\nquite serious.\"\nFirst day it's not gone well for\nCaroline and I. I had a purgatory day.\nJust brutal, brutal day.\nSurvived. Got to the finish. Just\neverything was conspiring against me a\nlittle bit. Really rough. 80ks at 3,200\nm, which will test anybody.\nI don't like a dirty bike, so I've had\nto have him in the shower. We did have a\nhorse pipe, but it didn't do the job.\nSo, I've just taken the bikes into the\nshell for a bit of TLC.\nHow was yesterday?\nInteresting.\nUh,\nI guess it's difficult as I expected,\nminus\nthe lack of understanding of elevation\nand what it feels like for us people at\nsea level. But the the landscape here is\nbeyond outstanding and it's pretty much\nwhat I came here for. and my invited\nfriends Ammani Tummer from the New York\nGiants and Joel Sepa. I think I did like\nthe first\n20 I not the whole thing but it was fun.\nSo you're smiling yesterday. You weren't\nsmiling so much yesterday. Well cuz I\nwas eating every every time I got a\nchance to eat some I ate everything. So\nI feel like I'm fueled up for today and\nnow I fueled up for tomorrow and I'm got\nto take it take that seriously.\nHey it's about having fun isn't it? Who\nwants to enjoy it? Austin, see, describe\nto me quickly today's route. What? Uh,\npretty flat for the first like 100k. I\nthink we got one little climb. It's like\n8K long and 300 m maybe or less and\nmostly pavement. I think almost 2,000 m\nof descending\noverall and what maybe 1,000 m of a few\nhund. Yeah. Um hopefully the group stays\ntogether. It's fast and uh we get it\ndone in what less than 5 hours would be\nawesome. I don't know. Got that big\nclimb, haven't we? After 20ks. It's not\na big climb. But do you think that's\ngoing to be enough to split the group?\nDepends on how how anxious everyone is\nto put down the gas. We'll see. I don't\nknow. Um hopefully hopefully we can all\nstay together. But you know, who knows?\nMight be a group of 40 or 50 or might be\na group of 20 or less. I don't know.\nWe'll see. Stay in the draft.\nOh, hello. Good morning. How are you,\nMark? Living the dream. Ask me about\n120k. Okay. Not been the same answer.\nOn the second day of the race, I had\nquite a serious mechanical, which could\nhave been a lot worse.\nMy front skewer came loose as I was\ndescending on a really, really rough,\nlong descent.\nAnd I had no warning at all. I hadn't\nheard any or felt anything prior to the\nwheel coming loose. And all of a sudden,\nI was aware that there was something\nwrong.\nI started to break hard, but as I was\nbreaking my front brake disc, the wheel\ncame so loose that the disc caught into\nthe brake blocks and threw me off.\nThis is Santiago.\nHe was out on a bike ride where I very\nrandomly\ncame across me lying in a heat and has\nhelped me to\ntake my bike so that I can at least\nfinish the stage.\nHello.\n[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hell, darling. Are you okay?\nYeah. I have some stories from today.\nOkay.\nYeah, I've got a few. Well, I finished\nCaroline's crash. I was like, [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]\nhell.\nYep. It could have been a lot worse.\nCould have been a lot worse. Yeah. Did\nDid Frank see you? Yeah. He saw me at\nthe finish. I mean, he didn't. He said,\n\"Oh, Caroline's crashed.\" Didn't soften\nit up. So, I went, \"Fuck.\" Um, but you\nsaid you were all right. So, gracias.\nOkay. I'm really lucky that I could\nfinish. Yeah. Hopefully he's going to\ncome in a minute, but a guy called\nSantiago stopped and he was just out for\na ride. He's from Bogotaar and and uh\nJuan here as well. And they stopped and\nhelped me to take the Well, I didn't do\nit. They didn't do it. He took the brake\noff the front. Yeah. Ah, just took the\nwhole caliper off. took the whole thing\noff so that I just could actually ride.\nSo you rolled just with the back brake\non the side. So I've had 50k of no front\nbrake, just back brake. At first I was\nlike, \"Oh, really scared going really\nslowly walking down the steep bits.\" And\nthen after a while I kind of realized\nlike what the braking power was with\njust one brake and I was a little bit\nfaster, but it was still pretty scary.\nUm, but yeah, you can't make it up. You\ncan't make it up. Let's have a look at\nthat. That's a good bit of battle damage\nrepair, I have to say. Yeah,\nit wasn't that hard like like I\nyesterday, but but it's still painful.\nThose climbs is unforgettable. But we\nare taking the recover.\nYou're having fun.\nDid you like those little climbs at the\nend? At the end, you know, the Garmin\njust say there there were no more\nclimbing. I suffer a lot. Garin lies.\nYeah, it always it is worse than a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]\nBut you look good on your wife's bike.\nYeah, we choose it. We We should We\nchoose it together.\nHow's your day going?\nI rode my bike today, Brian. No way. No,\nI rode it as as opposed to being a\npassenger. Yesterday was a passenger.\nYeah. Today is much mucho miko. Okay.\nDid you enjoy it? Yes. We've been But\nwe've been here before. Yes. For the\ntriathlon. Oh, it's true. See? Yeah.\nYeah. We have a great time. Yeah. Yeah.\nYeah. Yeah. Where did you come?\nThis\nyour machine. Yeah.\nHas your ice cream got cheese on it? No.\nNo cheese.\nIn Columbia, they put cheese on ice\ncream. It's crazy.\nAbsolutely crazy. So, no cheese. Is this\ngoing to be your fuel for tomorrow? Hope\nso. Is there bananas in there? Yeah.\nHave you just had a plate of pasta and\nYeah. I know. The concept of the race is\npointtooint. Every stage is a\npointto-point. So you have to stay in a\nhotel that's provided by the event\norganizers or you can sort out that\nyourself. What that means is that you\nhave to carry everything with you for 8\ndays. You can't just drop stuff off here\nand there.\nWhat day is it today?\nDay of the week. No idea. It's day four\nof dras.\nI don't know what day it is either\nactually. To be fair, I don't care. No,\nI don't care either. Once you've\nsurvived the physicality and the mental\ntorture of each stage, you've still got\nto have clarity of thought. And when\nyou're riding altitude, you you get\nbrain fog. So when you finish, there's\nstill a lot to do. You've still got to\nadministrate yourself and your bike.\nIn whatever town you're at, you're\nlooking for somewhere to clean the bike.\nThat's certainly my priority first to\nclean the bike and then clean Caroline's\nbike. And in every town there's\nsomewhere you can clean the bike.\nSomebody will do it for you. You can do\nit yourself. It's entirely up to you.\nAnd then you've even got to wash your\nkit by hand because it needs to be dry\nfor the next day.\nThere's not necessarily washers and\ndryers anywhere. So you have to wash\nthem in the sink. You got to improvise\nsometimes drying your kit\nbecause at altitude in some regions it\nwill rain in the afternoon. So, there's\nall these things going on in your mind\nand being conscious that you've got to\neat properly\nfor the next day and get your feet off\nthe floor as quickly as possible. So,\nwhen you finish, you're all just moving\naround. We're texting each other. Oh, I\nfound a we found a wash point. This is a\ngreat place to go. This is a great place\nto eat. There's cheesecake here. That\nkind of stuff. So, everybody's helping\neach other out when they've crossed the\nfinishing line.\n[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hell. That's really wrapped up.\nYeah.\nYou've not had much luck, have you? Not\nhad much luck. No.\nWhat was your situation in the last 45k?\nLuckily. Luckily I um so I was feeling a\nbit bonky. Yeah. Uh and it was Flavia\nand Ulisses. Okay. Ulisses. What a\nwonderful rider he is. He's beautiful,\nsmooth, very efficient, great\ndescendant. I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] latched onto them.\nNice. And I was clinging on for dear\nlife.\nYo,\nthat was next level,\nman. I have to say, uh, Ulyses, if I had\nnot seen you on that descent, I'd have\nmaybe been half an hour behind. You're a\n[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] weapon on the front.\nSo strong. Thank you so much. beautiful\ndescender as well. A group is always\nbetter than just one or two. But uh\nthank you for letting me have your\nwheel. No, thank you. I was hanging on\ndear life. Oh man, you well done.\nHeat. Heat.\nHow you getting on with that uh shower\nthere, guys? Primo. People pay for this\n[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] The Colombian shower. Nice.\nYeah, we had a really muddy section\nwhere people had to get off and walk\nwith their bikes. Everyone, not just\npack markers, everyone had to get off\nand walk.\n3 hours this morning of\nColombian wetlands.\nreally tough mud and grit and some of it\nso thick we couldn't ride it we had to\nwalk. Transcordier tests absolutely\nevery component of your bike and your\nbags and your body. And one of the most\namazing things is the Obeara was just so\nbombroof. Um that bike is so well\ndesigned. It it put up with everything\nwe threw at it including that horrendous\nmud day.\nHi.\nAnd super strong. You're super strong.\nWhen you went up that time, I was like,\n\"This guy saved my life.\" You saved my\nlife because I thought I was going to\nsnap the chain. I know. I When I hear\nthe the noise, I I learned another carry\noil. And your What's better with with\nthe oil that I put it on, I was like,\n\"Oh,\nyeah. Yeah, exactly. So then after I had\noil on my chain, I could actually ride\nmy bike. Before that, I was just like, I\ndon't know what to do. I'm going to snap\nit. Yeah, my chain was the same.\nI I had oil on me. I should have just\nput oil on it. I mean, I um\nI fed around a lot in that mud. I fell\noff and the place where I fell happened\nto be a freaking what we call in the\narmy a bastard bush. So I've got thorns\neverywhere. I was bleeding.\nAll my open wounds are just covered in\n[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I hit the other side of my\nleg. And there was so much um we had to\nwalk. I mean that 80 whatever K has\ntaken me I don't know 5 and a half\nhours.\nWe've only been riding a week. I mean\nyeah I've been riding a bit before but\nbrakes take a battery in nothing on\nthere at all. probably another\nprobably another 50k in there. So, we've\nchanged in this morning. Bit stressful.\nIt's rubbish. Yeah. So, simple going\ninto stage five. So, we're basically\nhalfway through\nsome food.\nSomething happened. I was taking off and\noh go to the to the bathroom but today\nit's okay but today\nit is amazing to see the skill and\nstrength of the women riders coming out\nhere it's such a tough race um to to\nactually race it and to see them you\nknow just fighting out it was inspiring\nand I learned a lot from myself from\nriding another week on that tough gravel\nLess than 10k to go. Less than 10k to\ngo. Yeah, there's definitely a huge\nsense of camaraderie amongst the riders.\nEveryone's in it together. It's like\nthis little bubble, this family of\npeople that moves around the country\nand everyone helps everyone with\neverything. Just relax.\nNice breath. Yeah.\nWhen I came to this race, I wanted to do\nas as well as possible. I was here to\nrace at every stage I was racing. That\nsaid, I would never not help anybody\nelse and the same for other riders with\nme and my and some of my incidents that\nI had. I had problems with my cleats on\none particular stage. Problems that\nwould never present themselves normally.\nAnd every rider that went past shouted\ndown to me, I was I was trying to fix my\nshoe. You are caging the hand.\nHey champ,\nhow you doing?\nYou enjoy that mud?\nA little. Have you stopped for drinks\nand coke yet? No. Okay. I'm going to\nstop at the next shop. What do you want?\nUm, I'll have Coke and water. Okay. One\nof each. Sure. Okay. Thanks. See you in\na bit. There's definitely a massive\nelement of camaraderie in Transcorder,\nmore so than I think I've experienced\nwith any other race of any other sort in\nthe world. There's never\na sort of feeling that you can't talk to\nother riders or help other riders.\nEveryone's in it together. Everyone\nwants to help everyone. Every time I saw\nsomebody stopped with a mechanical or a\nproblem, I would stop and put a foot\ndown and say, \"Are you okay? Do you need\nanything?\nWe need to give him the number for the\nphysio. He's got a bad knee.\nSo today it's day five of Kelsco degas.\nWe're doing Elsifon which was one of the\nhighest peaks in Colombia. It's uh we\nstart immediately with a climb. I turn\non my Garmin and immediately set start\nclimbing. It's going to be a 2,500 m\nclimb of 4,5 no 45 km, sorry. And it's\ngoing to get cold and maybe rainy, so it\nmight become a suffer, but let's see how\nit goes.\nI do need to stop and put a G down. And\nI'm almost speed bumps.\nAt some point, pretty soon, it's getting\npretty chilly, but all good.\nI've actually just passed Mark. He's not\nfeeling good. He's got a really sore\nback. It's always a bit disconcerting\nwhen I see him on the route.\nIt's definitely not what I want to see.\nSo, over 8 days, you have this peak and\ntrough. You have the mishaps. I had a\nbig crash on day four when I think I\nbroke my ribs in a lot of pain. Not on\nthat particular day, but then the next\ndays. And one day\nI could hardly ride and and it was one\nof the longer days and I knew that I was\ngoing to be in a lot of pain and\ndiscomfort.\nAnd I remember finishing and just\nthinking, \"Thank God\nthis is over.\" I sat down and Austin,\nwho I rode with last year, he's here\nwith his family and he's got two young\nnieces and they came over. They sat\nbeside me and within 20 seconds\nthey changed my whole outlook to just\nswitch me out of this self-pity and\nremind me of why we do what we do.\nAnd those are the memories that I will\nremember the most.\nOh, look at that. Beautiful.\nlooking good. Good [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Thanks.\nYeah, we're going down tarmac for at\nleast 20 minutes from here and then we\nget to the bottom and then that's where\nthe race starts. It's a really nice\ndecent climb. Beautiful. Like the scenic\nis well the views are beautiful.\nYeah, it's a it's good gravel. Yeah,\ngood gravel. And then you get to\nPalestina. We descend on a once again\nfive road. Quite decent. Then a little\nclimb. It's uh not even 10 minutes. And\nthen we descend again to where the next\nand last bit of gravel is. And it's\nactually probably the best gravel that\nI've seen. Yes.\nIn that last bit of gravel after that\nlake, the good gravel finishes. And from\nthen on,\nColombia is back.\nAll\nright.\nWe monito.\nWe're here in Tamasus. It has been such\na wonderful night. The the vibe in this\nlittle town is super cool. Just they\nwere so excited to have the race here.\nEveryone was so welcoming. Saturday\nnight activity here is is the cowboys\nand girls come out on their horses and\nit's kind of like a display but um they\njust trot around the town on these\namazing horses. It's so beautiful.\nOne of the things about Transcordas is\nthat it's just such a massive variety of\ndifferent types of riding from altitude\ndifferences of 300 m up to 4,150\nm,\nuh, rain, mud, lovely gravel, really\nrough gravel, and then some stages that\nwe're entirely on the road. So you have\nto be prepared for all the temperature\nvariations and all of the surface\nvariations.\nThis year we had one stage it was\nentirely on the road and that was up and\nover Alsafon which is the longest road\nclimb in the world and goes up to an\naltitude of 4,150\nm.\nEnjoy it girl.\nThis is your stage. This is yours. And\nthat was one of the days I actually got\non the podium. I felt so strong that\nday.\nWe're filming each other filming.\nI'm not going to stop. Feeling good.\nStill got bottle and a half. Done about\nhalf of the climb. So although it will\nbe a slower top half. Um, it'll also be\ncooler. I think I'll be all right.\nWe're getting really high now. It's\ngetting really hard to breathe. Just\nsaving energy.\nLove.\nYes. Nice. Go on. Give it a ch. Let me\nget the stick. Whoa. Whoa. Let me get\nthe stick. There we go.\nThat nice.\nWell, you can chew it if you want\nnice gravel today though. No legs. How\nwas that route? Amazing. The one that\nthe ones that I like. No suffering.\nShort and beautiful. Short. Fast and\nfurious. Fast and furious. Awesome. Good\njob.\nIt's hard to really articulate\nwhy Columbia is such a beautiful place\nto ride a bike.\nThe riding itself is exceptional. When\nyou arrive in these towns that even\nColombians have not visited\nand they they have this\nsense of community all around the\nchurch, families everywhere, children\neverywhere. Hola, enjoying each other's\ncompany.\nIt it is an amazing experience to be\nable to share that. And and when the\nColombians see you, they just want to\nshow this off.\nWe have mosa.\nWhat I'd really like to see is more UK\nriders at this event. We saw a lot more\nfrom Germany and other parts of Europe,\nbut no more riders from the UK, which\nwas slightly disappointing. And so the\naim for me and Caroline is to try and\nencourage people to come out and and\nreally enjoy this event. It's it's\nsomething really special.\nMy race on Transcordier this year was\nalmost like a race of two halves. I had\ntwo such bad days at the beginning with\naltitude sickness and then a big crash\nthat I essentially built through the\nrest of the race. But I didn't get sick\nagain. I did have some more crashes, but\nnothing too serious and I just sort of\nfelt stronger as each day went on. Um,\nbut yeah, my my overwhelming memories\nfrom Transcordis again this year will\njust be the people that I rode with. the\nfriends that we re-engaged with from\nlast year, new friends that we met out\non the course, new friends that we that\nwe met in and around the hotels in the\nevenings and just shared Colombia and\nthis amazing experience with\nI'm here with these two gentlemen who've\njust uh smashed Transcordio RS 2025. My\nsecond one. Sum it up in three words.\nBeautiful.\nBrutal [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] extra high\nand with a golden finish trying to kill\nus today. Yeah. Short short butts.\nSweet.\nThe final sticker. The final stage.\nwhere this very lovely gem\ngracias. Look at that.\nHardest own stickers ever.\nThe other thing to mention as well is\nthat the organizers are cyclists.\nThey're totally invested in you. They're\ntotally invested in you making sure you\nfinish, making sure your bike is is\nworking. They will pull out all the\nstops. They're on that finish line for\nhours making sure that you're safe and\nthat you're comfortable. And again, it's\na testament to um Mauricio and his team.\nI think this race will be the jewel in\nthe graveling sort of crown. I think\nit's going to transcend and supersede\nother events. I have no doubt in that.\nAnd I'm not getting paid to say this.\nIt's a fact. And I think this race\nyou'll have difficulty trying to enter\nit at some point and I think that will\nbe very very soon.\nHave you finished? Yeah. Is it okay?\nYeah. All right. Don't mind me.",

          "description": "Transcordilleras is a grueling 1035km (21,000m elevation) gravel bike race through the Andes of Colombia. The race has a non-stop version, but also an 8-day stage race which is the race Caroline and Mark attempted in 2024. With severe heat, high altitude, unforgiving terrain, and rough surfaces; this race had it all. But the pain and suffering was eclipsed by the warmth and hospitality of the Colombian people. They built lasting friendships, and never tired of the incredible views and raw beauty of the landscape. \nThis is a race which has been built by a team who love to explore. Hear about how it grew from friends bikepacking together, and continues to grow internationally now as gravel enthusiasts seek adventures in this country where cycling is as much part of the culture as coffee. With a route that changes every year, always taking the competitors to different areas of the mountains, this is one that should be on every endurance adventurers bucketlist.",

          "transcript": "ah good\nman we um Val\n[Music]\ntrans Cordis is an eight stage 8\nday uh 1,00\nand 35 km 21,000 M\nelevation Race Across three mountain\nranges of\nColumbia um the\ncordilleras\nand it is one of the hardest things I've\never done you're\nright what's your vision for the future\nof the race so it's funny because at the\nbeginning it was four friends that we\nwere just doing casual weekend rides and\ngoing for trips bike paring trips and\nthen a lot of people starting asking us\nlike please invite us to those trips\nI've seen the pictures on social media\nand I want to join and gravel was\nstarting in Colombia and uh more people\nstarted getting into gravel and\nbackpacking and they asked and asked and\nasked and so at some point we said like\nmaybe we should make an event out of\nthis you\nme look at me\nokay how you feeling I'm feeling quite\nsmug I just chat to a a Brazilian lb I'm\nfrom Brazil so Brazil don't have this\naltitude I I I it's not have you\nacclimated have you been here in the\ncountry no I I arrived\nColombia Friday Friday night so more\nthan just about 36 hour here in Colombia\nhe got [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] loads of kit on his bike and\nwe've got a couple of water bottles and\nabout five\ngels it's a bit\n[Applause]\nchilly not the first time but like maybe\nthe first time I was felt like I was\nrunning because before I was like two\nand a half hours 3 hours into the race\nof day one I was like I've not seen\ngravel like this I've not felt heat like\nthis and I had my bike on my shoulder\nthinking holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I've got eight more\ndays of this I've been here a\nweek and I've not seen any of this\ngravel like this been hiding for race\nday man alive\nI've not I've not stopped breathing hard\nfor the last two hours all right I'm\nmight on me back now there we go SLS off\na\nbit I'm I'm on the 12K ultimate climb\ntoday it's a 1,100 M elevation going you\ncan see why I can't even see where it\ngoes and I'm just decided to push this\nbit not because I could ride it\ntechnically but because I was nearly\nblacking out from lack of oxygen and I\ndo actually want to get to the end of\nstage\none they want strange cuz everyone's\njust trying to find their feet and this\ncompetitiveness going around with other\nRiders and you're tune and throwing so\nnothing's really settled and you you've\nnot really forming any friendships at\nthat point and you can sense the anxiety\nand sort of tension in the\nair and I was probably riding maybe 5\nhours and I was descending with last\nyear's winner Julian and uh I came up\nalongside him you okay I don't know\nman and he was he was in a lot of pain I\ncould tell he was in a lot of pain he\nmaking a lot of noise\nand then I I I went over to him cuz he\nsaid to me keep going keep going I'm\nokay I'm okay and I looked at his knee\nand went you went okay son no you can go\nyou can continue man just let me wash it\nfor you okay man [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] me no that's B\nthat's bad manate yeah right keep your\nright you ready yeah I'm ready yeah yeah\nyeah I'm ready I'm ready good\nman good night\nsee do you have anything to cover and\ndidn't our first aid which was a school\nboy error because I could address that\nwound um but I stayed and I cleaned his\nwound because there was a lot of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] in\nthere but the size of the wound was\nreally quite sobering for me cuz this\nwas day one I wasn't descending\nrecklessly but it was loose it was\nTechnical and for me that was probably\nthe best thing to witness because it it\njust sobered me up a a little bit go on\ngo on you happy yeah yeah I'm happy okay\nmy friend take care\nyeah I'm at the top of what I'm just\ngoing to call the Behemoth for today\ntook me about 2 and a half hours I\nthink um and now I'm just really really\nexcited to get down a little bit and\nthen back on Tom and do the 25k to the\nFinish holy\n[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] oh my Lord\ngood\nrunning what a day we've got a pool to\nchill out here isn't that brilliant that\nroot was amazing that last\nclimb it was brutal\nloose I fell off I fell off going up tce\nI'm not surprised I just got off my\ntires yeah I was pushing a lot I cuz I\nturned the gar on I thought I'll just\nhave a look see how far this clim is\nnine [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] kilometers took me two\nhours yeah me and a half yeah yeah\nunbelievable yeah I was getting like\nblackouts I'm at 25 I've got 300 more to\nclimb but really I don't have words for\nit so [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]\nhard I'm choosing not to ride things I\ncan ride\ntechnically\nbecause I don't have the\noxygen I feel as I've been on exercise\nfor about 6 weeks\nand even though we're High we're\nprobably flirting with 3,000 M he's\nstill BR\nup yeah so the guy who won last year\ncrashed just in front of me and I\nstopped to help him and clean his wound\nthis was maybe 2 or 3 KS before the big\nclimb so I used 500 M of water to cuz it\nwas full as [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and I maybe I slid\nmyself out and guess my bike just threw\nme off you weren't going fast I I I was\nyeah yeah it was we were going pretty\nfast we were going fast but we weren't\ntaking we weren't taking like too much\nrisk RIS but still that's why maybe I\ndidn't broke anything up I think you\nwere just unlucky yes what's your name\njulan julan well good luck I hope you\nrecover well thank you very much have a\ngreat come back and do it again yeah\nyeah I won last year so I won you won\nlast year yeah nonstop holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] man\nyeah okay I will we we'll win next year\nman we'll train for that and luckily I I\nmean I was close and yeah\nno remes it's going to be always there\nthank you very much it was great meeting\nyou thanks thanks\nMark why should we go for a dip let's go\nfor a dip\nokay oh man that's\ngood to do some Synchro do some Synchro\nif no one comes what do we do because we\nthought no one was going to come it was\na crazy idea and it's never been done in\nColombia and it was such an like a huge\nER challenge we open the the\nregistration and for our surprise it was\n27 people and the funny thing is that\nout of the 27 only four finished\nsorry yeah I'll try\nthat we are riding to the start on the\nmorning of day\ntwo pretty bad\nsleep trucks getting past all night uh\nwith like 4 M gap between the road and\nhalf\nbedroom but I actually don't feel too\nbad so let's uh have another good day\nwe're going to go almost straight up and\ntoday is 90% gravel which means all\ngravel and 3,000 M elevation\ntoday more is it more yeah it's slightly\nmore than yesterday 35\n39 depending on what you believe and the\nfirst climb is over 12 is 1200 M first\nclimb is big one and then we've got a\nreally big one just towards like the\nback\nhalf yeah let's hope we don't uh don't\nhave too many problems\ntoday keep my powder dry cuz in about 10\nminutes I'm going to be a world of\n[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] we got a 17K climb from the from\nthe\noff and these boys are all carrying\nK I'm carrying [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] all\nme\nman it's getting hot now but the surface\nis much better much more\nridable just found a hseep pipe well\nsome water irrigation inside the road\nthere's one up here as well had a bit of\na douche\ngoing to stop cuz having a bit of potato\nwhile I'm just sing cuz it's downhill\nuphill downhill uphill all day no flat\nso I'm going take me time that guy fell\noff yesterday I was quite sobering I\nwant to stay healthy for this so taking\nmy time this is the longest defense I've\never done I have to say but look at\nthat no be around\namazing I'm on first climb of stage two\nand I'm loving it it's like\nridable it's cool okay so we have to\ngain a vertical K in 12 km but you know\nif we can ride it all it's a\nbonus I had stop and get a video of this\neven if it means leing time look at that\nI can't just ride through this it's\nfreaking insane this road it goes all\nthe way up there see the scar along the\ntop I've still got maybe four or 5K to\ngo but\n[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] this is\nincredible yeah let's get it done how\nlong is it taken roughly hour 20 so far\nyeah I think\noh that's a clim beautiful clim though\ngot two more big climes today two more\nyeah I don't think I think little more\non this one but probably\nsleeper it's been good climbing\nthough nice getting into a\nrhythm oh we get a bit of shade un like\nyesterday the only time I've had to walk\ntoday this is the last real climb it's\n500 M it finishes at about 2 and 1 half\nthat b there oh my God I just didn't\nhave the\nwheel it's so hot as well now man I've\ngot maybe\n17K which doesn't sound a\nlot but when you're at 2 and half th000\nm\nand I\nknow it's not a descent today there's a\nfew little bastard Hills just to\nfinishes off but this is the last major\none than God\nman I'm\ndying I have got about 10K to\ngo completely\nfrazzled but I'm on tarmac so that's\nnice it's a nice has Chang the last 50k\nhas been absolutely horrific and I guess\nthere's going to be a point in every day\nwhere it's like just suffering and today\nyeah that happened it was just so rough\noh my God\nyep look at\nthis under stage\ntwo I've just had a proper sit down and\na load of f it's got pretty hot today\nbut I found the root so much better much\nenjoyed it much more than yesterday um\nalthough they were both amazing in\ndifferent ways just the last section my\nhands really really started to hurt just\nblistering on their palms just getting\nrubbed by the constant bumping it was it\ngot really loose and and\nheavy uh but yeah I'm just so sh to be\nfinished and be in this beautiful place\nfor the evening\nI had to St up and get be brok yeah and\nthat help you\nyeah I\nneeded one of the things that I really\nenjoyed about the race was that so many\nof the people racing were Colombian and\na lot of them have lived abroad for\nyears have come back or still live\nabroad and are coming back just to do\nthe race um so they're also exploring\ntheir own country but are so proud of\nthe of the environment of the Heritage\nand of the fact that now it's one of the\nthe world's best cycling destinations\nand people can come here and enjoy this\nthis\nWilderness see you on Sunday yeah J the\ndays I\nwas yeah how you doing today you ready I\nmean woke up like foggy eyed a little\ngroggy didn't want to get up but I still\nmanaged to wake up like 5 minutes before\nmy alarm so I think that's that's a good\nsign like\n455 after two or three days you you find\nyour feet you find your little cohort of\nother Riders you sort of equally\nmatched and you you you'll ride a long\ntime on your own and then you'll end up\nwith a riding\nbuddy woo beautiful day\nsuper hard and you just shoot the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]\nand I was shooting the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with loads\nof Columbian guys who were so proud to\nshow off their country all the way\nuphill we are at\nkilometer\n74 and he off Hill until the\n109 so we're now all uphill yeah yeah oh\n[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and it's very cold at the moment\nit's freezing\nbut it's fine it's fine look at that\nyeah it's worth it at least because for\nthem as well it was the first time that\nthey'd been to certain parts of the\ncountry because some of them have had to\nleave when they were children because it\nwas a dangerous place to live and now\nthey've come back so they really want to\nshow off and you really get a sense of\nthat when you ride with them look good\nyeah thank you it was amazing climbing\nwith\nyou we did it kind of fast for my level\nso yeah\nthat's very cool you want me to yeah\njust turn\nit how's it going another day mountain\nbiking in\nColumbia\ntomorrow I'm I'm having 55s like a you\nbig fat 55s on there I'm\n52 so yeah yeah this is for Colombian\ngravel Colombian gravel is not the bike\nyeah this final part you know because\notherwise we will be a little bit slower\nI\nguess end of day\nthree I'm going to do a tire change I've\nJust Seen AEL I've been riding with him\nand he caught me up and he dropped me\nlike a break on the descents\nit's so rough I'm going to go a bit\nfatter and a bit lower\npressure let's see if I out Hemorrhage\nmore time than I have\ndone but tomorrow's a flat stage so I'll\nkeep these tires\non day three was just absolutely brutal\nfor me um I had to dig really deep to\nget to the\nFinish you okay babe\ngracias all right\nyou had a bad day today okay really bad\nis Mountain Biking again W it my body\njust ined I was so close with myself\nbecause I just wanted to be enjoying it\nbut I couldn't I was\njust just nothing was working I've\nstarted the series of climbs that finish\nthe day off and at the moment feel like\nthey're going to finish me off\ntoo it's 35° here in the valley there's\nbarely a breeze it's really [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]\nhot and this climb here's\nJ absolute Legend on his mountain bike\nwe've been toing and throwing all\nday\nsee my garment just told me there's some\nblack sections coming I mean if that's\n[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] green then I am actually going\nto die going up here so I need to\nrest just what really want to get\nfinished now\nI'm\njust I'm dressed in my bik kit yeah yeah\nuh but my mind is not yeah in my bik kit\nmy mind's in bed the bad sleep that's\nnight as well\nthan I'm not really absorbing any\nnutrition which is bit of a problem\nsee how we get\non day four was like week\nfour got massive descent it's on tarmac\nit's about 40K which is okay but I was\nwor whenever was tired\ndescending and then we hit this long\nPlateau it's going to be really hot a\nsection that's really shitty maybe 40\n50k like really shitty\nI'm just trading out cuz it's going to\nbe red up it's very few\nshots\num yeah when you look at the profile you\nthink oh yeah easy day no I think maybe\nwe're going to be riding 7 8 hours I\nreckon it be longer who knows\non\nso now we're in a really hot humid part\nof\nColumbia um called the magdalina\nValley\nand I think we've got a really tough\ngravel section now I just stocked up on\nfluids in the town everyone\nwas and just going to really try\nto measure my efforts today you\nchange I had a bit of a sort of Fever\nthing last\nnight definitely stomach is not good\nit's feeling better now but have not\nbeen able to eat more than a banana and\na little bit of sugar yeah so far so I\nknow I've got to be really careful just\ntrying to stay hydrated and hope that\nthings turn around for\nme okay here's the team Santi and\nJorge we have how many kilm 15 15 km to\ngo we're on the road busy road but it's\n[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] tarmac and we are loving it\nSanti is pulling like a bull on the\nfront and we're going to get it smashed\nfor hey on his mountain bike just doing\nan amazing job what a\nlegend super fried out here so hot\npretty much a sea level go on gravel\nuntil till it wasn't that's how it\nalways is huh so dirty\ntalk to me how was\nit every day it's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] brutal but in\ndifferent ways\ntoday man it's so\nhot that flat section was just loading\nup and down those bastard\nHills okay away thanks\nalmost finished this guy's giving us a\nlittle\ndraft bike make it real special\nday five which was the queen stage just\ngoing to be the hardest\nstage um was another day where I just\nhad a\nshocker and Proby I'm all on my\nown done about\n50k and I was with the group main group\neveryone was chilling everyone's tired\ntoday we were just poling along first\nhour and a\nbut I was I kept having to go to the\nside thinking was going to throw up and\nthen yes I had to stop so welcome Palomo\none of the guys from the\ncrew found me and went to a chemist and\ngot me some sort of I guess it's like di\nlight so I've drunk some of\nthat\nand just going to have to go at my own\npace now\nhere\nI think I'm about 100K into this ride\nday five it's\n160k depending on what you believe it's\n350 or 4,000 M of\nclimbing hey Mark but a lot of it is\ntarmac\nthankfully\nuh every day is just\nPurgatory in attrition and just sort of\nafter 50K 60k\nyou just did a world of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] oh man but\nthe views pretty\nspecial we rode a bit of gravel on a a\nridge line so you could see left and\nright pretty\namazing oh\nman today the last climb I think it's\nmaybe 30k it's\nbrutal yeah so I'm going to save myself\nfor that\nm m m m m\nm is possible\ngracias it's not been going well feeling\npretty\nrough\num and we just had a long gravel descent\nand my stomach was just in not so\nbumping and bumping and bumping was just\nreally careful anyway I got it done I\nthink I see Road maybe I don't I need to\nkeep leaving I'm going to get back on\nthe road at some point some the\npain I remember getting to the finish\nand just crying because I was just so\nempty come on let's get you let's get\nyou some water get in the room get\nshower yeah I want a protein shake with\nice it what about one of those\num um lemonade coconut\nshakes I don't know if you'll do protein\nhere babe no we've got one in the room\noh yeah wa well let's go and get it\nthen I have a a sense that we need to do\nmore for the country I mean we were\noutside for 14 years we were lucky\nenough to be somewhere else when the\nthings were not so nice here and\nnowadays that we call these home again\nand we have our families here and also\njust help change that image of\nColombia I think the biggest thing that\nwe get with the event and uh one of the\nreason is so successful is because\npeople here are super friendly\nI just comeand these two guys and the M\nstopped my the bikes we doing some\nfilming and uh got the guy on the back\nto do some filming to show off the\nsuspension on the forks think it worked\nquite\nwell I mean I'm just programmed to think\noh what does he want has he got a knife\nis he going to Nick my\nbike um but they just wanted to chat and\nthey wanted to ask us about our bikes\nwhat we were doing how often we rode we\nwere training for what we would do I\nmean it was just like a nice yeah nice\nchat and then we employed them and then\nyou decided that you would employ them\nas cameraman for your filming so they he\nalso uh get some credits on the film but\nyeah it's just really nice and we also\nhad a car earlier stop we were just out\nhere stay mared we just stopped and he\njust said welcome to\nColumbia look they\nlove let's go let's\ngo those glasses\nskid for\nkids there he is again good\nman he\nempty but I got here when I finished I\nsaid I'm not doing tomorrow and now I'm\nhere that's how I am\nevery I was right out that last say when\nI get there I'm going to tell them I'm\nnot starting I'm going to go and have a\nholiday somewhere and then I 5 minutes\nafter I finish I'm\nlike I know I know yeah day six Thursday\nFriday I don't know Friday Friday oh\nman so there's a lot of road work going\non lot of construction on these roads\nlot of dust the good thing is though\nit's a vast Improvement on what we've\nbeen riding it's it's relatively\nsmooth again having a nice with him Ste\nanyway not being bounced\naround we topped out the climb I think\nwe topped out on this one maybe so one\nmore climb for\ntoday nice one on day six when I didn't\nknow if I if I could even get through it\nI was riding at the same Pace as another\nguy fabrio and we ended up spending\npretty much the whole stage riding\ntogether day six this of\nthis completely mental\nrace and it appears I'm surviving today\nis better than yesterday and I am here\nonly and it took my mind off the\nphysical pain and discomfort Comfort but\nactually I loved that day and just\nriding my bike again the views were\nincredible the landscape on that day was\njust so beautiful\ntoday I decided to stop with Fabricio\none of the guys I'm riding with for some\nproper food we had some\naass finally my stomach feels like I can\neat a little bit I'm hungry I've got\nenergy and I'm\nactually I'm really enjoying riding my\nbike again for the first time in a\ncouple of days so I'm really really\nhappy for that and\nyeah this is\ncolumia AGA AA\nAGA\n[Laughter]\nokay\nLind Lind\nI you see still got it still got\nit oh filming each other filming each\nother no beds\nhe's gone he's gone he's gone he's gone\nhe's\ngone M have him have him I love\nhim not very shiver us\nH so good picture of his triceps\nlook there were definitely all sorts of\nabilities of people doing this race from\nthe really really Speedy guys at the\nfront who barely stop during a stage to\nthe guys at the back back who stop for\nlunch and you know just enjoy enjoy\ntheir experience and go at their own\npace but I think you have to still be\nready for this sort of weekl long\nextreme cycling experience to come and\ndo it it's not something that's out with\nthe reach of anybody um who likes this\nkind of thing\nbut it it shouldn't be\nunderestimated hey what's this go down\nfilm sonm\ntoday's stage is um a descent and then\nAscent is 72k I think the ascent is 45\nso we're just going to be climbing all\nday basically after The\nDescent but apparently tomorrow is just\na easy spin\nbasically um so yeah just going to try\nand enjoy today like yesterday it's kind\nof difficult because you want to race\nbut I mean I always want to race I'm in\nto race but I mean ultimately my body's\nnot letting me so I think\ncompletion is going to be a massive\nachievement for me\num so just focusing on getting it done\nthis year I think almost 24 people in\nthe staff\nevery day there we had six cars we have\ntwo\nmotorcycles and so it's grown so much\npeople from all over the world but I\nstill feel like it's always we need more\nwe're still behind H the pace that the\nevent has been growing so we're super\nhappy for that I know there's a lot of\nthings that we need to H continue\nimproving but we're happy I mean there's\nhard events all over the world there's\nprobably events that are even harder\nthan this one but there's just the\nculture and and and the way you get to\nexperience the country is very unique\nfinal\nyep\num suffering a bit\nbut I look forward\nto\njust rolling along to the tat today even\nif it's a bit up and down I'm not having\nto battle my\nbike and it's a really beautiful I mean\nhor experience look at\nthis even feeling so sick I can\nappreciate how\namazing the whole thing is so\njust go grab a banana all right grab me\none babbe yeah y\nwe're lost already Mark yeah\nless than 10K to go\nwooo let's go\nwhen I finished the race Mauricio came\nup to me I said how how was that how did\nyou enjoy it yeah colia it has it all\nyou know you know the biggest thing he\nhas Smiles Smile everybody smiles

also just\ncompleting some pretty epic pieces of\nRoad pushing through some pretty unique\nLandscapes that aspect of it was equally\nas important as the element of trying to\nR\nsomeone are you\nready should Bo some bfx when you edit\nthis well I made it to\nbitar it's uh taken quite a bit longer\nthan I expected so it's was about 30 6\nhours door to door big old travel day\nbut I made\nit I'm here headed out for a bike ride\nI'm going to go meet my\nmate and legend julan manri for a bit of\na pedal where are we he's climbing upot\nclimb paos paos leaving the\nsunshine a good l\nit's morning\nin orar Columbia and we've been talked\ninto\ndoing the fastest Bunch ride in town\nit's currently 20\n4 and we got to be out the door at 4:30\nmeeting the motorbike rider um to get us\nto the start\nsafely and the starts at 5:15 and then\nthey race for an hour\noff I have some\nregrets what are we doing this is okay\nthis is our okay hundreds of bike riders\nout we we all left at 5:15\na.m. what is happening everyone was just\nlike flat\nout and then went and ripped a lap\nfinished up the back of patio's dropped\nback down into bogar\n[Music]\ndude that was\nhard and hectic\nso I can't breath nice it was hot dude\nwhat it was hot that was hot I know you\nwere moving what you were good you had\ngood gas you look\ngood this is the sweet also the\ncheesecakes are amazing all all this\nplace is amazing yeah met up with willan\nfor a coffee um but sick morning I was\nregretting at 4 4:00 the alarm went off\nand I was regretting agreeing to go but\nthen the second we got out there I was\nlike this is sweet it's pretty surreal\nthough just like ripping the\nhighway uh the sun wasn't even up\neveryone was just like flat\nout to try this you need to try this one\nyeah that smells delicious\nwhat so see you in the\nafternoon this is this is buo the\noriginal bu is just just the do it's\nlike a donut Le one havee a filet\ngood\nLord that is so\nsweet what delicious dude it's\nlike stuff of Dreams donut hols in\nAmerica like a giant one yes fill with\ncaramel this should be good in the\npocket in the in the stage that we are\ngoing climbing the sephon uh if we stay\ntogether in that stage there the last\ntown before the top there is a a lady\nthat sell some the best Aras I ever had\nand patro show me that place we can stop\nthere in that stage and take their\nrapers to the\nbucket the best I had uh the best of\nrapers I\nhave the climb the one behind Brian's SP\nthat drops all the way down and it had\nlike uh sweet Filly I dream about those\nones Brian took me one day and then I\nwent Again by myself this is delicious\nwow look at the oil you could Loop your\nchain with\nthis this is a really nice place we call\nit\nPlaza here we can try different fruits\nlike really nice stuff have you Tred\nthat have you tried this one you need to\ntrade this one this it Lulu have you\ntried Lulu\noh wow it's like something familiar\nabout it it's kind like a passion fruit\ntaste it's like a treasure\nman that's special it's like a crazy\ntastes like a crazy passion fo it's\ncalled um\nsa that's this is really weird and also\nthis\nthe people there are incredibly genuine\nand Incredibly proud of where they're\nfrom it's like infectious it's really\nrefreshing this is D cow a monster I\nthink we can all be very like Grass Is\nAlways Greener cuz I think the people\nthere really appreciate where they're\nfrom and really want to share it how are\nyou doing good man how are you you're\nkind of I guess like blessed in coming\nand being able to be shown around by\npeople who who really just genuinely\nwant you to love as much as they\ndo comes to Colombia he has this weird\ntradition just to get random tattoos\nwe're getting this time of fron this\nplant is quite important actually\nbecause it only grows in high Innovation\nand it's the one that is in charge of\nthe water in Colombia you will see it on\nthe first stage and it's huge and it\ntakes at least one year to grow like a\ncentimeter or 2 cm something like that\nso it it needs a lot of time to\ngrow how heavy is that not we're going\nto put it in\nthe we're just packing up here in\nbogatar and heading over to Chi which is\num the town where uh the race is\nstarting so it's up over a big mountain\nand then we'll drop down the other side\nit's been a nice day here but I'm\ndefinitely ready to get out into the the\nnice less chaotic Countryside and get\nready for this race\nit's very peaceful W welcome to the\nparamos a unique high altitude landscape\nlocated in only very few parts of the\nworld here you will notice the frer\nhorns and\nthe you can't see them now the black\nvultures circling above a harsh but\nbeautiful\nlandscape how do you feel feel great I\nfeel calm I feel very present\nI\nfeel like I'm becoming one with the\nL\nwelcome I captured three birds you saw\nthree birds I captured them oh cool my\neyeball Capt Capt I love being in\nColumbia you know the place is beautiful\nit's definitely like the people and\nfriends here that really make it for me\nI feel like coming back into the\ncountryside today you're kind of\nreminded of what the roads and the towns\nand everything out here look like and\nit's\nso oh don't you hate\nthat all right yeah and it's just like\nit's beautiful and there's going to be\nso much epic riding to\nI don't feel like a huge like\ncompetitive Drive which isn't\nnecessarily A Bad Thing excited yeah man\nI'm excited it's going to be racing with\nmy boy fck yeah yeah I don't know if we\nraced each other no first time no\njusttin training\nyeah just racing against\ntheas yeah\nexactly I mean I'll race hard but like\nmainly excited for just the riding that\nwe're going to have with the clouds like\nthese up there it's going to be\nwet wet and cold yeah no\nthe format of the race I think is really\ncool you're self-supported from the\nstart to finish in terms of you can only\nuse resources that are available to\nother riters you're kind of stuck with\nwhat you got\nlook at that I was I was just nessing it\nthe whole time\nso the last time Simon and I raced was\nat the jro um during the co year so very\ndifferent circumstance than it was nice\nit felt like you know a lifetime ago\nthat uh I was racing in that world and\nto see him there uh in a very different\ncircumstance was pretty cool why we go\nup to\n4,200 yeah he also showed show me uh a\nphoto from back at tour of Utah when we\nwere in the podium together I guess both\nof our parts have changed and winding up\nracing bike packing racing Columbia\ntogether is pretty cool\nto put the wet shoes straight back on\ncuz I don't have shoes I'm going to get\na turn F\nsome I know\nwelcome to colia\nboys you see like a hole if I hit that\ndie trying to BU up your around okay\nwhere is everyone we all here what\nhappened\nthere's like to it but then sometimes\nit's just like you get it wrong by like\na little bit it's a tra yeah you\nknow I know I was like oh my God like\nhow long do this\nclimb to Long mhm not play up I was like\nwell I know where I am\nthe hotels were booked all in advance so\nthat's one element that wouldn't be\nallowed in like a a true bike packing\nrace I I I thought that actually added\nto it because everyone was staying\ntogether everyone kind of convened\ntogether at the end of the days I\nthought that was actually a cool\naddition semi self supported I would say\num in terms of you looking after\nyourself in terms of food mechanical\nstuff a bike packing racing stages\nreally oh no this big one that's a are\nthose is that a bar Bach it's a bar dud\nmaybe it is big giant bar like a psycho\npsychopath\na\nthree ready to go springing\nchicken yeah we got a solid crew it's\nhow like it to be just like group of\nfriends going on big old bike ride bit\nof an adventure definitely making it up\nas we go which I like that's that's for\nme it's the\ndream I'm hoping that the race has that\nenergy atmosphere and we can like\nmaintain that fun\nelement cuz you get like you always get\nquestions like are you going to win you\ngoing to like I don't know like I'm\ngoing to race as hard as I can but I\njust want it to be like a nice uh\nAdventure\nhey I steal John's camera\nthis is Simon simony\nthat's\n[Applause]\nwe had\nlike 50ks of mud and then\nuh 35k of\nfing and it was going well I was in\nfront by long way and then uh and then I\ngot too\nhot I got really hot on the climb and\ncompletely overheated um\nand yeah I\nsuffered a lot ran out of water just all\nthe\nclassics day five\nready to go up the\nvolcano we\nhave we're at 1500 M and we're going to\nI think\n42,000 today straight from\nhere the stage is uh 100 C all on\nhavav a little crusty the stomach was a\nbit so so yesterday but I think I'm all\nright now\nI think I'm out the\nwoods the beauty of doing a route like\nthat with a bunch of other people is to\nshare their company you know even after\nthe stages or before the stages um\nhaving dinner with different people like\nyou all get to\nto kind of bond over this I guess sense\nof accomplishment completing something\ndifficult every day it's nice to like\nshare that with people as opposed to\njust do it by\nyourself this place it's supposed to be\nthe first ski station in Colombia really\nit was full of snow but in the days in\nthe 50s on the last Hill it was three\n[Laughter]\nzombies trans cordel what are you\ntalking about it's\nbeautiful oh oh fr\nall right I think as adults you forget\nthat like well not forget you very\nrarely get to hang out with mates for an\nextended period where you like get past\nthe like catch up and then into just\nlike B\nlike funny banter and then be on that to\nlike serious conversation again and then\nyou're like kind of doing that day in\nday out you don't get that much as an\nadult and like when you just have time\nfor it you know it's not what we've got\nto be you know we're all doing the same\nthing so it's nice it really nice\nw\nif you viewed it exclusively through\nlike a competitive lens um you would\njust miss a lot you'd probably be in bed\nearlier or like be more stressed about\ntrying to recover or you know pushing\nwith your head down a bit more during\nthe race miss a lot of what the\nexperience has to\noffer from Australia welcome to the line\nof Australia\nso now we have our first and second\nplace I know I look very\nyoung but I'm very old I have a small\nchild\nmyself look\nit's the last day of transpor stage 8\nwe're headed to Hardin it's only a short\nstage 55\n60k which is going to be action packed\nuh yesterday's anything to go off the\nroads around here are very bumpy one\nlast\nRumble\nJumble the first time I was in Columbia\nI was 9 years ago uh and I did a bike\npacking trip with my brother which is\nlike a thereabouts trip and yeah it\nfeels like a lifetime ago but it's nice\nyou know like I still you know on the\nrides we've been doing I can recognize\nplaces and few good like old friends\nhere kind of familiar so it feels good\nto be to be\nback woo there you good\ngood it's been a hectic start to the\nyear and uh yeah the chaos continues\nsee\nwith black\n[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] The Adventures of black [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] in\ncolia the adventur of Mor yeah he's\ngoing far\nbeyond today

buy\nthree\ntwo\nyou can start riding if you want how\nmuch did you buy\ni\ni'll buy another one who knows fish\nit's crazy man this is\nhumid\nthe bags i am not used to the bags are\nreally difficult\nit's good it's really fun\nlet's go\n[Applause]\nlooking like\nit's gonna be steep high altitude lots\nof insane vertical but uh looking\nforward to the challenge\ni think that this race is something\nunique\nand special because he's here in\ncolombia and i love\ni've had enough colombian teammates to\nknow that\nthey're fast\ncolombians look they look skinny and fit\nand they're smaller than me and they go\nuphill really fast and they're used to\nthe altitude\nwe we'll see what happens man i'm just\nhere to beat lawrence yeah as long as i\nbeat lawrence and damn i win so\nwe're good buddies we always have fun\nadventures i think we see on a similar\nlevel we've always been friends in the\nraces even if we weren't teammates we\ncall it frenemies we're we're enemies\nbut we're friends i think he will be\ncrying for his mom after five days\nbeats you know he's strong one day races\nlooking good on the bike and looking\nskinny but still he is like\na santa rosa california you know and\neight days\ndoing all this stuff for eight days in\nthe colombian jungle i think he will be\nlike like this you know like\nhis head is spinning around already you\nknow he was telling me just stories\nabout jed\ninstead of leg rommers i took knee\nbombers and i said man if\nif winning this race depends on this bit\nlittle piece of\nstuff on your legs then you better quit\nand go back to santa rosa right now\nwould be great if a colombian wins it\nbut obviously we are extremely honored\nto have\nthese other professionals here i think\nis an honor to ride with them it would\nbe nice to see them suffer a little bit\nas well\ndone it again\nget out there\nwas a dream it's something that we\nwanted to do with a couple of friends\nin total we are four founders and\nthe idea is to\ntake advantage of the opportunity we\nhave\nhere in colombia it happens that the\ncordillera de los andes decides to split\nas soon as he comes into colombia and so\nthat gives us the opportunity to\ncross the country climbing three times\nfor los angeles\ntoday we did some math it's like\n50 hours in seven days so\nyeah\nit's going to be a challenge i think\nit's going to be the best week of the\nyear for us\nfor total we have a\n1055 kilometers and we do 28\n500 meters of altitude gain\nand in total of\neight stages and we also have the\nnon-stop category which will\nprobably be finishing about four and a\nhalf five days\nthe course is insane the ride is a super\nchallenge but then i think for\na lot of us too um is the just the\nlogistics right it's getting the food\nevery day uh when you start early you\nhave to have maybe get breakfast the\nnight before and put it in your hotel\nroom\nyou have to fix everything yourself you\nhave to clean the bike so even if you're\nnot pedaling\nthen you are either eating cleaning the\nbike getting ready for the next day\nand all the logistics so it's just\nevery day is busy\npete i'm going to show you the the\ntypical colombian ledge\npandeja\nyou have to order it\nit's a plate full of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] but a lot we\nneed a lot of calories anyway\nthis is a race that takes every single\nounce of energy that you have this is\nsomething that you have to be mentally\nprepared you have to be\nphysically prepared\nthis piranha\nhe's gonna take a lot of courage to\nactually finish this race\nso\nthis is gonna be the whole week like\nthis huh\npete i think he retired the same year as\nme from the world tour we always had\nsome connection when we were racing in\nthe pro peloton\nhe likes to race gravel so he came\nreally into careful as a racer allowing\nme to have my list low right fast\nslogan you know and he wants to win\neverything\nbut at the end he's turning more into\nlive slow you know because he's drinking\nmore beers and stuff like that\nand we raise each other and we give each\nother [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]\ni like him\n[Laughter]\nlauren's 10 damn\noh\nhe's the uh\nthe chiller but he's also that the cagey\nold racer who he he can't quite forget\nwhere he came from so he still wants to\nstick the knife in you whenever he sees\nthe possibility he has all the old\ntricks where you know he kind of looks\nat signs in your face if you're\nsuffering and\nhe looks for an opening so\nlauren's he might be playing it cool but\nhe's he's competitive\nokay\ni'm really glad he came like i think it\nmade it so much better because\nwe have this history together and we\ncould push each other for\nnot only this race it made the racing\nmore fun more exciting but also\nfor the rest of the season\nhe's so competitive\nlive slow ride fast\nrace race race\nthis is insane\nuh\nfar too long\nand i've\ngot a message\nfrom colorado straight from texas\nyou captured most of me just let me be\nit's just amazing\nthe bridges and the tunnels and the\njungle and the rivers wow\nincredible\nlet it build up\nnice scenery i really like it today i\nreally like it people i have to warn you\ntelescoriers is not a walk in the park\nat the end you're still crossing the\nunrest the three the three codieras of\nthe undes so you have to go up down up\ndown up and down again\nhe said that was almost there\nthank you\nafter day one\ndon't underestimate transcodiers it's\nhard it's rocky\nit's steep\nit's unforgiving\nit's warm\nsometimes it's cold sometimes it's wet\nthe route is just absolutely bananas\nit's it's so freaking hard man\nthis is insane this is nothing but\npain and suffering heat\ni'm enjoying it a lot\ndecorate and now the truth i hope you\nguys will consider this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]\nbecause it's not doable\nbesides that we're having a good time\nokay i'm off\ni've been better this week but\nit's okay not hurting too much\nlet's get to the finish i can clean it\ni was stupid\ni was in uh actually\npete took the downhill really slow and i\nknow i was in this wheel and just not\npaying attention i hate the phone brake\non the slippery part and just my phone\nview went gone\nso i'm pissed at myself yeah this\nholiday\nwow look at this\ni've never done this\nso hard\nlots of meat was climbing\nand i needed some salt that's why i\nbought the ships\ncrazy ninja\nthat's that's what i want yeah this\nthing's a little bit silly\nbut uh\nthat's what it's all about it's uh\neverybody has a\ncomplications in the trans cordilleras\nuh yesterday it was\ntough for me i had the complications\ntoday lauren has had some complications\nwith the crash in his gears and\nsounds like even you guys on the moto\nhad complications so something happens\nto everybody here it's pretty wild but\ni'm able to enjoy today look around a\nlittle bit\nthere's a lot more racing to come but\nyou also need a friend on some adventure\nlike this you just can't\ngo punch for punch and and solo the\nwhole time\nthen then it becomes too hard but if you\nhave a friend in the mountains it's a\nlittle bit better\noh man\nare you ready to go ready okay\nthe reason i still keep racing gravel\nafter i'm retired from from 16 years in\nthe pro pelaton you know on the road\nis that actually the gravel bike gave me\nback also the law for biking\ni was a little bit fed up with road\nracing you know i was maybe too skinny\nput too pretty much pressure on myself\ni had those those goals and i needed to\nchase them\nso then i raised them out got second one\na few other races and then i saw the the\nracer inside me\ngot the book again you know and that's\nwhy i'm here in colombia racing\nfor the win and being with my friends\nand stuff like that\nthere's a racer somewhere inside me it\nhas to be let out at least six times a\nyear with a number on the back you know\nand that's what i that's what i live for\nit's not it's not just the nature you\nsee and exploring but also the racing to\nbe honest yeah\nthis race is so hard you just grind\nright you're just you never really\nthere's no intensity usually it's just\nhigh altitude you kind of have like a\nlimiter on you because it's so high\nelevation and\nyou just kind of pedal hard all day so\nit was really nice to kind of have a\nlittle bit of the spicy moments that we\nalmost created just for a little bit of\na spectacle\na\nkiller dies\ncongratulations congratulations great\nride the guy who wanted it the most one\ntoday yeah\nno thank you thank you that's fine\nattacking the city\nkill or die\nshouting matches\nwe've been to surreal\npatches i know that it's true\nbut there's still more left to do\nlike a clean rain\npouring down on me\nall these phases\nthat in races\ncutting corners\ntaking orders\ncause i feel\na change\nthe magic of gravel it's the community\nand i know everybody says this in every\ninterview but it really is and this is\nwhy\ni went to grapple is

every night and it\nfelt like a lot congratulations man nice\nwork thank you your bicycle is like you\nit's a piece of work here my at first\nglance my favorite piece thus far is the\nlittle shorty Arrow bars with The\nQuon yeah incaps I still got to find a\nway for to Def to raise them because\nactually this is like a mix and match\nlast minute buildup you know in order to\nto test the bike already for two divide\nyeah but you as you see this is not over\nhere they're not cut yet because it's\nactually those are my arrow bars for my\nuh G bike and if I use them I'm really\nArrow you put it further out yeah\nfurther out and but I wrote further\nScotland with it like that and I\ncouldn't walk for 5 days when I finish\nthat ride after 26 hours you know in air\nis not possible so I want that thing in\nScotland but I was like it can I cannot\nrace like that to divide yeah so I\nshortened them but now I need also find\na way to raise them so probably here are\nspaces needed or whatever so it's still\na a project to be built but the basics\nis like a full suspension yeah with the\ndrop bar will be will be like this I\nthink so specialized s Works Epic full\nsuspension uh Pro what's the what's the\nbar Pro bar it's the same bar as on my G\nbike okay so I I'm a roadie at the end\nyou know so I like Drop bars yeah and I\nput the\nextenders I put a like a a light light\nwith\na with an auu you know with a so so no\nDamo so I'm still testing next next\nmonth I'm going to test the Dynamo Hub\nif I like it better oh oh yeah yeah\nDynamo Hub yes yes yes to have uh to\nhave electricity yourself right to be\ntotally self-sufficient wo I got a spare\none with me but I didn't use\nit but I lost my w in the last Ulta I\ndid so then I had to wait for the number\ntwo and then we rode together to the\nfinish\nso never never go to happen again\nI so is this wire going to a an extra\nbattery what is what is this what is\nthis oh no that's just a clip I thought\nthat was a wire coming off\nHol got to stay man on your left in The\nVillages you got to move the people\naround what up per get out of the\nroad nice how many hours did you sleep\ndo you think all told for 1,000 km 3\nhours the first night yeah 3 and 1 half\nhours the second night and 45 minut\nminutes the third night so in total it\nwould be 7 hour 15 nights yeah are you\nsleeping in a bed are you

was not planned to sleep\nthat short but I woke up after 35 45\nminutes and I saw R is close like 2 3K\nyeah and I thought\nlike that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] might not go\nsleep you know\nso either way I turn around and lose the\nrace yeah or I got like this and SLA\nmyself in the face and let's get going\nand I did the last one and I I hoped\nstill he was going to sleep and then I\nhad the easy night but he wasn't so we\nhad like a Dr race all the way to the\nFinish oh wow wow two more questions\nworst part of trans cordier non-stop\nbest part trans cordier worst part was\nthe right to PTO berio when it was like\na th000 degrees Yeah like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it was\nso hot and I did it at 3 pm and Robie\nwas going and I was like you can win it\nI just need to back down back off now so\nwe passed the river I swim in the river\nfor a few minutes yeah then I was laying\nin a creek for a few minutes I found a\ngirl and I could shower with her but the\nshower was hot because there was a\nrooftop uh you know bucket on the roof\nit was like a heated shower is not what\nyou want and then I was like in a shed\nfor 90 minutes somewhere at the kiosk\nand then I went to the hotel\nI arrived at 7:30 and I heard Rob was\nthere only 50 minutes before me so I was\nlike okay he must have been suffering\ntoo you know yeah and then I woke up at\none and I rode through the night and\nthen it was actually perfect because\nthen the night was better and the best\npart was maybe that day after that day\nbecause I was great scenery I had good\nlegs I was I was 6K in front actually\nthe very best part was uh checkpoint 2\nokay there a big party going on when I\narrived I had pizza I had tacos I had a\nbeer okay I stayed there maybe for 90\nminutes way too long but we Ino\nor people there I've been there on\ntraining camp at Dum okay so I I know\nthat last year we were there the week\nbefore the race so I know them pretty\nwell yes so I couldn't go within 30\nminutes they all want to pictures and\nyeah so we were there at uh at Toyota so\nthere's Scarab bicycles there's a coffee\nshop toyata\nBrewing yeah fr's close we were having\npizza there and beers yeah it was a big\nsocial thing and some nonstop nonsters\nwould come in and they'd be like I can\ngo out on the road by myself where I can\nstay here with the party so I stayed for\na while I was also 60k in front back\nthen

Riders describe it as crossing three cordilleras through jungle terrain with steep climbs at high altitude and humid conditions. The ride to Puerto Berrio stands out as particularly challenging due to extreme heat requiring riders to seek relief in rivers and creeks. Logistics prove as demanding as the riding itself - daily tasks include securing food, cleaning bikes, and preparing for early starts. The non-stop category can be completed in 4.5 to 5 days with minimal sleep. Colombian riders are noted for their climbing speed and altitude adaptation. The race attracts international professionals who experience genuine Colombian hospitality. Riders emphasize the need for both mental and physical preparation as the race demands every ounce of energy over the multi-day format."
