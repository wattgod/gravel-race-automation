      "expenses": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "International flight to Colombia, eight days of self-supported travel, gear shipping, and whatever they charge for entry. No cost breakdown available but getting to Paipa, Boyacá and surviving 1,000km of bikepacking won't be cheap."

        "explanation": "Over 20,000 meters of positive elevation gain across 1,000km through the Colombian Andes. That's 65,617 feet of climbing - nearly seven Everests worth. High-altitude páramos to jungle valleys means constant vertical punishment."
      },
      "climate": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "February brings hot, humid Colombian weather that adds serious challenge to multi-day suffering. Shifting climate zones daily from high-altitude páramos to jungle valleys means you'll cook in multiple ways. Heat and humidity don't forgive."

      "altitude": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "High-altitude páramos in the Colombian Andes with significant elevation changes across three mountain ranges. No specific max elevation data but páramo ecosystems typically exist above 3,000 meters. Your lungs will notice."

      "logistics": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Starts in Paipa, Boyacá with basically zero logistical information available. No airport details, lodging options, or packet pickup info. Self-supported format means you handle everything yourself in rural Colombia - good luck with that."
