Only 1% single track, but it defines the experience. Similar technical demands to Gravel Worlds.

The full camping experience with meals, luggage transport, and hot showers removes the usual stage race logistics headaches. One rider called it 'a fabulous event with incredible attention to detail,' and encountering diverse wildlife while grinding through BC's mountains beats another corn field gravel grind."

Deferral penalties are brutal — $500 if you bail after May 1st. Flying into BC and getting to the Canadian Rockies isn't cheap, and the race extracts maximum dollars at every decision point. Higher total cost than Badlands."

There\nare a few sections where having a little\nbit of suspension is quite nice.\nSo, the future shock is quite handy. The\nthe diverge also comes with this seat\npost that provides a little bit of\nsuspension as well. Just takes out some\nof the rough edges on some of the more\nchallenging descents. The Diverge did\ncome with\ncarbon fiber rims, but Katherine and I\nopted\na few years ago to get a second set of\nwheels,\nand we bought wheels that are\n650B rims so we can get wider tires onto\nthe frame. We're each running\n47 mil tires\nand we're running them with about\n30 PSI.\nA few years ago, we also decided that we\nwere going to upgrade our\num\ngroup set.\nSo, we went with the ShraMM red.\nWe're running a 1052\nuh\ncassette on the back.\nThat 52\nreally\ngives you just a few extra gears for\nsome of the tougher climbs on the Trans\nRockies Gravel Royale. We also decided\nthat we wanted to go with\nelectronic shifting\non the longer days. It's nice just to\nhave that\neasy feather touch shifting.\nIt's just so much more enjoyable.\nFor pedals,\nI've got\nthe\nShimano XTR.\nI've also got a Garmin\n1030 solar.\nUm, and I've got all of the\nroots loaded onto the Garmin, so we\nshouldn't have any difficulty\nnavigating the course. We are running\na one by\nthe practice.\nThis came standard on the diverge.\nAnd so that's what we will be riding at\nthe Gravel Royale,\nthe 2019\nSpecialized Diverge\nwith a few little upgrades.\nWoo!\nWoo!

Riders encounter tough climbs requiring wide-range gearing like 10-52 tooth cassettes, plus challenging descents where suspension helps smooth rough edges. The course demands 47mm tires at 30 PSI for optimal performance. Forest sections significantly slow pace, making it a demanding day for riders. Electronic shifting proves beneficial on longer stages. Navigation requires GPS with preloaded routes. The race tests equipment durability with potential for damage. Riders emphasize enjoying the experience over placement given the technical challenges. Mixed terrain includes everything from smooth gravel to rough forest trails requiring versatile bike setups."
