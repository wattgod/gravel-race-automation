Only 1% single track, but it defines the experience."

        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Chief Medical Officer warns 'rain can turn quickly into snow, especially on passes' with temperatures ranging 'above 30 degrees celsius and below zero.' Andrew Davidson faced 'a rain-soaked course that sapped the legs that little bit extra' on Stage 4, while forest fires forced course reroutes in multiple years."

      "altitude": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "The Canadian Rockies location suggests elevation but no specific altitude data is provided for start, maximum, or average elevations. Without knowing if you're climbing at 1,000m or gasping at 3,000m, the physiological demands remain unclear."

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Rob Britton earned 'my first win as a gravel pro' at the 2022 inaugural edition, but this remains a 3-year-old event building reputation. No documented prize purse or established pro field beyond scattered elite participants. The course difficulty earns respect, but prestige requires time to develop."

      "race_quality": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Andrew Davidson praises 'incredible attention to detail and positive energy from all involved' with timing, results, and support. Carter Nieuwesteeg notes 'every TR crew member put passion into it,' though Andrew Davidson's multiple mechanical failures highlight the self-sufficiency demands of remote mountain racing."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "300km across the Canadian Rockies with a new mountain pass daily and 5,500m of climbing creates adventure. The full camping experience with meals, luggage transport, and hot showers removes the usual stage race logistics headaches. One rider called it 'a fabulous event with incredible attention to detail,' and encountering diverse wildlife while grinding through BC's mountains beats another corn field gravel grind."
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "They reserve 50% of early bird spots for female riders, which shows intentional community building rather than bro-fest default. The multi-day camping format forces actual interaction instead of drive-up-and-leave racing. But it's still a 3-year-old race without established community traditions or that deep tribal knowledge that comes from decades of shared suffering."
      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Elite participants include Rob Britton, Cory Wallace, Rach McBride, and Barry Wicks, but the 2024 men's race became a 'tactical battle' dominated by Quebec's 'Poutine Mafia' duo. No prize purse attracts serious talent, with the event appealing more to adventure seekers than competitive depth."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "$2,099 CAD ($1,549 USD) for 300km of racing is $5.17 per kilometer — that's premium pricing for an unproven event. Compare that to established European stage races offering twice the distance for similar money. Yes, you get meals and camping, but you're paying resort prices for what should be suffer-fest economics."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Base entry hits $1,549 USD before you add mechanical support ($399), massage ($115/hour), transport options, or the final banquet ($79). Deferral penalties are brutal — $500 if you bail after May 1st. Flying into BC and getting to the Canadian Rockies isn't cheap, and the race extracts maximum dollars at every decision point."
