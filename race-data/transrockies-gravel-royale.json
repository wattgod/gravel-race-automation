The full camping experience with meals, luggage transport, and hot showers removes the usual stage race logistics headaches. One rider called it 'a fabulous event with incredible attention to detail,' and encountering diverse wildlife while grinding through BC's mountains beats another corn field gravel grind."

Deferral penalties are brutal — $500 if you bail after May 1st. Flying into BC and getting to the Canadian Rockies isn't cheap, and the race extracts maximum dollars at every decision point. Higher total cost than Badlands."
