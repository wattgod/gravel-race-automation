No historical weather incidents mentioned in available race reports, though tire pressure loss during McGregor's race suggests challenging conditions. More weather exposure than Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego.

        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Part of the Pennsylvania Gravel Series where McGregor needed to win for the overall title, but field sizes of 23-64 riders per category suggest regional rather than national draw. Third year running with limited visibility outside the series."

      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Post-race meal, event shirt for early registrants, and Hammer Nutrition samples create solid race-day value. McGregor brings his children to the podium for memories, noting 'There aren't many spouses at the races. There are fewer kids present.'"
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Family-friendly staging area with activities for children sets it apart from typical gravel races. McGregor emphasizes the family aspect, describing his wife Amanda's presence showing 'hard work, dedication, grit, and excellence' through family support."

        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Winning times of 2:15:49 for the 41-mile and 3:52:14 for the 71-mile suggest recreational pace rather than elite competition. Field sizes of 23-64 riders per category indicate modest regional participation without national-level depth. Thinner field than Ouray Gravel Grinder. As Evan McGregor puts it: \"This race highlighted my progression as a performing athlete over the past year... Leading into the race was the longest taper I've ever done of almost two weeks.\""
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Chip timing, aid stations, post-race meal, event shirt, and awards for top three in each category deliver solid infrastructure. Early bird pricing with only $10 increase shows restraint, while family activities add value beyond typical gravel race offerings."

      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Registration runs $50-75. McGregor's tire pressure dropped 15 psi during his winning race, suggesting technical terrain demands on equipment. James Creek, PA location keeps lodging costs reasonable in rural Pennsylvania, though driving distance from major airports adds travel expense. Similar expense level to Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

          "transcript": "43 minutes southwest of Pittsburgh is a\nlesserknown gravel biking area which\nsits between Hillman State Park and the\nWhiskey Rebellion routes. Just like the\nrest of Pittsburgh's Hinterlands, you\nwill find a patchwork of gravel and\nlightly traveled pavement. Using a\nclassic adventure mapping software by\nNational Geographic, I began piecing\ntogether the area's most prominent\ngravel roads, creating a 56 mile roller\ncoaster of a route crisscrossing the\nPennsylvania West Virginia border.\nThe route climbs almost 6,000 ft through\nthe heavily dissected Alageney Plateau\nand follows the same paths Native\nAmericans and early European settlers\nfollowed westward. High on the ridges\nand low in the wide valleys.\n[Music]\n[Applause]\nThe route starts here at Cross Creek\nPark in West Middletown. Cross Creek's\ngravel goodness is relatively forgotten\nabout. Some decent gravel segments along\nthis route only have a handful of\ncyclists enjoying them. After this, you\njust might rethink Hillman State Park as\nPittsburgh's go-to gravel destination.\nAfter leaving the park, we immediately\nenter the ridgetop community of West\nMiddletown, which was the middle pit\nstop for horse and buggy travelers of\nthe late 1700s. A day's ride from\nWashington, Pennsylvania, and the Ohio\nRiver crossing at Wellsburg, West\nVirginia.\nThe early roads of the time followed old\nNative American trails along the ridges\nto avoid the wet valley bottoms and\nambushes. There were five inns,\nblacksmith shops, harness makers, and\nother businesses that supported the\ntrades passing through the town. The\nrston grain thrasher was invented and\nmanufactured here, which prompted Henry\nFord to visit West Middletown to buy one\nof the last remaining ones.\nNow head down this partially closed road\nand down the hill to ALA.\nAs part of the western frontier, ALA\nhosted American frontier men, grist\nmills, and refuge forts built by\nsettlers for protection against Native\nAmerican attacks as the area lacked\nformal state protection due to the\nundefined borders between Pennsylvania\nand Virginia. The town's transformation\ninto a coal mining hub began in the\nearly 1900s after the completion of the\nWall Bash Railroad. This is what remains\nof the Wbash Railroad's connection into\ndowntown Pittsburgh.\nCole was king in Abella, but it left\nscars on the land and blood in the\nstreets.\nOne crazy story is that on April 22nd,\n1910, drunk Slavic miners crucified\ntheir mind boss named George Rabish, who\nwas accused of spying on the men for\ntheir breachment of company roles. They\ndrugg him out of his house twice and\nattacked him. On the second time, they\nused spikes and rope and left him\nhanging for two hours before he was\nrescued, but later succumbed to his\ninjuries.\nWhile traversing this route, there is a\nspiderweb of high tension power lines\nthat loom overhead and gas lines\nunderneath. From multiple viewpoints,\nyou'll see the Cardinal plant in Ohio\nbillowing smoke and steam. AI data\ncenters are placing a strain on the grid\nand reliable electricity is being\nsummoned from this region again. This\ntime in the form of natural gas to power\nthem. Billions are being spent to\nconvert the decommissioned coal fired\npower plants to natural gas for AI. And\nour electric bills are still on the\nrise.\nThis road has a legendary name, Shades\nof Death Road. As you can imagine, ghost\nstories and folklore abound on this\ngravel back road.\nZipping down State Line Road towards the\nWest Virginia border, you'll pass the\nBirch Creek Farmer.\nTo the right on an adjacent hilltop sits\nan old relic from the 60s. This AT&amp;T\nlong lines tower was part of a\ncross-country network of microwave\ntowers that transmitted phone calls,\nmilitary comms, and television\nbroadcasts line of sight using horn\nantennas.\nThe relays became obsolete in the 80s\nand 90s when fiber optic technology\nemerged.\nThis tower connected Wheeling to\nAlequipa.\nAll the pavement up until now will be\nworth it for this next gravel road in\nWest Virginia along Amspoker Ridge.\nThis is one of the best gravel roads\nthat can be found around here. It has\nmore of a feeling of riding through\nKansas than West Virginia.\nThe Amspoker family called this ridge\nhome since the 1700s.\nIt is said that Zelma Amspoker attempted\nto do everything in her power to\npreserve the land of her forefather's\nhomestead, but eventually lost to the\ncoal companies who stripped the land.\nThe area was stripped in the 1950s\nbefore any reclamation laws were\nestablished and stripped again in 2008\nand slightly put back together to\nnormal.\nAfter exiting the strip mine, you\ntraverse down into the valley and end up\nat the map dot of Scott Run.\nAt the bottom here in Scott Run in 1795,\nJohn Decker was traveling from West\nLiberty to Weiron when he stopped to get\na drink from a spring across from the\nWiggins property. Native Americans from\nthe Mingo tribe shot and sculpted\nDecker. Hearing the shots, Tom Wiggins\nand others chased the Native Americans\nas far as Harman Creek. Decker was\nburied here in Scott Run, close by to\nwhere he died. His death is notable\nbecause Decker was the last man in Brook\nCounty, West Virginia, to be killed by\nNative Americans.\nFast forward 127 years on July 17th,\n1922. A deadly battle took place on the\nother side of Cross Creek between\nstriking miners and mine guards at the\nCliftonville, West Virginia coal mine.\nTensions escalated when the mine\nemployed non-UN workers. Approximately\n300 to 500 armed men marched down the\nWalbash railroad from Abella to the mine\nwhere they burned the tipple, killed the\nsheriff, and killed eight others.\nAfter this dirt road, you'll head past\nthe pivotal archaeological site. the\nMeadowcraftoft Rock Shelter, which is a\n1973 discovery that pushed back\nestimates of human habitation in this\npart of North America by thousands of\nyears. The rock shelter was a major\nstopover for hunter gatherers who\nsheltered under a massive rock overhang,\nleaving their presence upon the layers\nof soil dating back 19,000 years.\nOn this back half of the route, you'll\nfind the most gravel. No matter how you\nwant to slice a route from Cross Creek,\nyou'll find a great distance matching\nyour needs.\nAcross this bridge is Bethany, West\nVirginia. In 1840s, Bethany College was\nthe first institution of higher\neducation in West Virginia.\nThis is also your last chance pit stop\non this route if you need water or\nsnacks at Chambers General Store only\n1,000 ft up the road. Bethany also has\nthe jazz station WZU 88.1 FM\ntransmitting above its town.\nOkay.\nHeat.\nThis is Dog Run Road, a wilder path with\nmultiple creek crossings and a\nwaterfall.\nThe forests have so much undergrowth\nthat it limits your sighteline and\nhinders any views of sweeping vistas\nwhen climbing.\nA bird's eyee view of the topography\ndoes the landscape you're traveling\njustice.\nDeep under this canopy, you can feel the\nstruggles of early settlers traversing\nthe hundreds of similar valleys in the\narea.\ncrossing over Brush Creek again. It's\nhard to fathom that this whole area was\ngoing to be flooded for cooling a\nminemouth power plant. Back in the 70s,\nthere was a proposal to take 8,000 acres\nin this valley and build a coal plant.\nBackbone Road hugs the hillside, leading\nyou closer to Buckrun Road.\nBuckrun Road is another state gamelands\nroad similar to Dog Run, which is\ngenerally pleasant.\nOnce you approach the end of the road,\nthe state and gas companies put down\nsome super chunky gravel, making it\nabsolutely brutal.\nOnce you survive the chunk, you'll hit\nthe final two gravel roads, Popular and\nthe farm road of Pawsum Hollow.\nWhat do you do?\nAs we coast to the end of this gravel\nbiking adventure, the rich history of\nthese lands lingers in every pedal\nstroke.\nThese gravel roads, etched with the\nstories of settlers, industry, and\nresilience have guided us through a\nliving museum of Pennsylvania's and West\nVirginia's past.\nThank you for riding along on this\njourney through time and terrain, and I\nhope you gained a decent perspective of\nwhat this region close to Pittsburgh has\nto offer.",

It starts at Black Point Park & Marina and runs between the canal and the working end of South Miami-Dade's Mount Trashmore to SW 97th Avenue. It is part of the Black Creek Trail. I often ride it up to SW 112th Avenue - across the canal from the South Dade Government Center / Library / Cultural Center.\nFor the section I ride, the only conflicts with motor vehicle crossings are at 97th Ave, Old Cutler Road, SW 216th Street (a major intersection where you have to negotiate 3 directions of traffic including on / off the Florida Turnpike, and 112th Avenue. \nThe Black Creek Trail actually ends at SW 184th Street just West of Zoo Miami / Larry & Penny Thompson Park. 8.7 miles from Black Point to SW 184th Street.",

It connects the Northern trail system with the Southern Trail system at Raystown. It flows well from both directions but in this video I rode it from the Baker's Hollow Trailhead (Down).
