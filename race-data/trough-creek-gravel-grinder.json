      "race_quality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Chip timing and well-marked course hits the basics, but the distance discrepancies between official listings and reality suggest organizational confusion. Aid stations at reasonable intervals with cutoff times that won't stress anyone. Gets points for not being a complete shitshow."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Post-race meal and event shirt if you register early shows they're trying. Ohio Gravel Grinders claims it's 'racers' favorite course of the year' but that's a hell of a small sample size. Starting in James Creek near Trough Creek State Park has potential but no specific course highlights emerge."
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Pennsylvania Gravel Series participation suggests some regional following. Three years in and they're 'very excited to continue' which reads like attendance is marginal. No rider quotes, race reports, or community buzz anywhere online."
      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Zero mention of field size, competitive depth, or notable participants. No prize purse means fast riders have no reason to show up. Three distance options might spread an already thin field even thinner."
      },
      "value": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Chip timing, aid stations, post-race meal, and shirt for what's likely reasonable entry fees in central Pennsylvania. Early bird pricing with only $10 increase shows restraint. You're getting legitimate race infrastructure without big-name markup."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "James Creek, PA isn't exactly a destination resort town so lodging should be reasonable. No major airport nearby means driving for most, but central Pennsylvania isn't expensive territory. Rural location keeps costs down once you're there."
      },
      "length": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Distance confusion everywhere - official site lists 71.4, 40.7, and 33.6 mile options while known info suggests 50 miles. None of these distances push serious endurance boundaries. More like a solid training ride with numbers."
      },
      "technicality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Mixed dirt, gravel, and paved roads with no mention of technical features or named climbs. Course maps show standard gravel grinder fare without obvious technical challenges. Pennsylvania terrain can deliver but nothing suggests this route exploits it."
      },
      "elevation": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "4,000 feet over 50 miles delivers legitimate climbing without being punitive. Course options range from 3,132 to 6,224 feet of gain so there's teeth if you want them. Pennsylvania hills don't mess around even if they're not Colorado."
      },
      "climate": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Late September in central Pennsylvania runs 50-70°F typically, which is rideable but not ideal. Fall weather brings rain potential and unpredictable conditions. No historical weather incidents mentioned but that might just mean nobody's paying attention."
      },
      "altitude": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Trough Creek State Park sits around 1,000-1,500 feet elevation. Sea level lungs won't notice any difference. This is Pennsylvania hill country, not mountain altitude training."
      },
      "logistics": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "James Creek isn't exactly transportation hub central - closest major airport probably Pittsburgh, 2+ hours away. No parking, lodging, or packet pickup details provided suggests either poor communication or limited infrastructure. Registration opens January 2nd shows they're organized enough to plan ahead."
      },
      "adventure": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Trough Creek State Park area has potential for scenic Pennsylvania backroads but no specific course highlights mentioned. Three distance options let you choose your suffering level. Reads more like solid local riding than destination adventure."
