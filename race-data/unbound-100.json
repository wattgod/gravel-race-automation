        "explanation": "100 miles (actually ~103-108mi depending on year). A serious day in the saddle—elite men finish in ~5 hours, but mid-pack riders face 7-10 hours. The distance alone doesn't break you; the terrain does."

        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Not MTB-technical, but the flint rocks are brutal on equipment. Sharp, chunky gravel requires line selection. Washed-out gullies and primitive roads demand attention. Mud years add chaos. The terrain is simple but punishing."

        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Kansas late spring is brutal. Temperatures can exceed 100°F in the afternoon. High humidity, full sun exposure on open prairie, and severe weather risk. 2023 showed the mud can be race-defining. Heat management is survival."

      "logistics": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Emporia is small—hotels book out fast after lottery results. Kansas City airport is ~2 hours away. The town embraces race week but accommodations are tight. Many camp at the fairgrounds or stay in nearby towns."

      "adventure": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "The Flint Hills in late spring are stunning—wildflowers, big sky country, isolated ranch roads through America's last tall-grass prairie. The mass start experience, Commercial Street finish, and festival atmosphere create lasting memories."

You'll still get humbled by Kansas. You'll still earn your finisher glass. And you'll probably start eyeing the 200 the moment you cross Commercial Street.",

Elite times are under 5 hours, but many riders face 8-10 hour days. You only get ONE checkpoint—that's 50+ miles of self-sufficiency each way. When the mud hits or the heat spikes, 100 miles feels like 200.",
      "consequences": [
        "Flat tires happen constantly—multiple riders fixing flats at every descent",
        "Only one checkpoint means you carry everything for 50+ miles",

      "expectation_reset": "Run 40mm+ tubeless tires with robust casings. Carry multiple spare tubes, plugs, and a pump. Train in heat and humidity. Pace conservatively—the Flint Hills punish ego. Have a rain/mud plan. Expect something to go wrong. The finish line party makes it worth it."
