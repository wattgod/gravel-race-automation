          "transcript": "Heat. Heat.\n[Music]\nWe're in beautiful Emporia, Kansas,\nwhere thousands of riders mark their\ncalendar each year for the opportunity\nto take on miles and miles of the\ngorgeous Flint Hills.\n[Applause]\nThe North Course is punchier and\nchunkier. It's a beast. It's I mean\nchunky like the gravel. It's just like\nthese massive rocks. This event takes\nrespect and it takes significant\npreparation.\nIt's one of the most unpredictable races\nbecause of flat tires and mechanicals\nthat can happen to equipment.\nIt's just a beatdown. Like, I don't care\nhow hard you train. I don't care how\ngnarly of terrain you ride on on a\nregular basis. To race 200 miles on this\nterrain is just so destructive.\nHigh speeds, more chaos in the field.\nEveryone's just up in the game. Like,\nit's just one little notch after one\nlittle notch.\nThe competition level is through the\nroof. I think this is probably the most\ncompetitive field we've ever\nhad. A result at Unbound means a lot\nbecause it's a race that people around\nthe world have heard\nof. Unbound started in the parking lot\non the northwest side of town with 36\nriders. Um, and most of them were from\njust around the region. It was not a big\nnational event.\nIt's changed a lot. Obviously, starting\nin 2006 with uh no GPS and just Q\nsheets. In the early days, it was a\nlittle bit more choose your own\nadventure, if you\nwill. 20 years ago, Emporia was not a\ncycling town. There were a dozen of us\nthat rode bikes. Now, there are hundreds\nof the 4,000 people lining up to take on\nUnbound. 10% of them come from within a\n20m radius of Emporia, Kansas. It has\ncompletely transformed the identity of\nwho we are right here in Emporia.\nLifetime coming on board with us in 2019\nwas a big game changer. Um, Lifetime\ndefinitely believes in building\ncommunity and healthy way of life.\nThere's a history before lifetime at\nUnbound Gravel and there's a history in\nEmporia, Kansas before Unbound Gravel.\nAnd it's our job to preserve the ethos\nof the event and to ensure that when\npeople leave Emporia, Kansas, they know\nwhat the Flint Hills is, who the people\nthat live here are, what they do. But\nit's this community that makes Unbound\nGravel so special.\nThere are rocks flying everywhere. There\nare crashes happening. It is really hard\nto focus for 10 and 1/2 hours. Perfect\nworld scenarios don't exist in Unbound.\nI don't know if anyone has ever finished\nUnbound and not just had everything\nhurting. It just beats up your entire\nbody.\nIt's such a race of attrition. You're\ngoing to feel it so bad. Just brutal all\nthe way around.\nUnbound is the champagne of gravel. baby\nis the biggest gravel event in the world\nfrom what I hear and I'm new to racing\nand I thought there's a lot I can learn\nout here um not just from the course but\nfrom the people that are involved. I\nrode 300k a couple of weeks ago um on\nthe road and that was all right. Um but\nthis has got a bit more climbing than I\nhad in that and uh I've never ridden\nthat far before so it's not far outside\nbut it's enough to be intimidating a\nlittle bit. My son is actually in one of\nthe races. So, we decided to come down\nhere and watch him and make ourselves\nuseful. Just means the spirit of gravel\nand just like it's like there's no\nlimits. You're going to be maxed out.\nIt's going to be a mental challenge.\nIt's going to be a physical challenge\nand you're out in the middle of nowhere\nand it's just you, your bike, and you\nknow, whatever you can put together\nmentally on the day. You know, whatever\ncomes out of the wash is going to come\nout. you're going to have a real winner.\nMan, this is my first time here and so\nfar the atmosphere uh people uh is\nsomething else is amazing. Amazing.\nAmazing. Definitely they will this will\nbe in my calendar every year.\nUh we're going to do the Unbound Gravel\n2025. You know, it's we're coming up on\nuh what is it like 4:30 now. Um we're in\na pretty good place with the setup. Um\nyou know, nothing's left now but the\nriders. You know, we're just waiting on\nthem to get here and get this thing\ngoing. A little bit about our course map\nout there today. We've got I want to\nwalk everyone through what our riders\nare going to be facing. those first 25\nodd miles heading north out of town.\nKind of a gentle start to the day,\nletting all our riders know what they\nare in\nfor. Doesn't come until about mile 26 or\nso, but that's going to be the first\nreal section of the race that everyone\nconsiders. That's C Reserve Road. The\nfirst section of pretty challenging\ngravel up that way. From there, it's on\nto Escridge, which of course is the\nfirst neutral water stop of the day.\nJust beyond Escridge, of course, the\ninfamous Divide Road section. Another\nchallenging spot. Then it's on to Alma\nin the first of two checkpoints out on\nthe course. After that, Little Egypt is\nalways one of the toughest sections of\nthe course. That's going to come right\naround 104 miles. From there, we'll head\ntowards Council or Alta Vista, rather,\nwhere they'll continue to head\nsouthbound. And Council Grove then will\nbe the second feed zone out on the\ncourse where they have an opportunity to\nconnect with their staff for the final\ntime of the day. Just south of Council\nGrove, the course starts to head a\nlittle bit more eastbound and at roughly\n75 miles. That's when they start to hit\nthe Lake Cahola area. Twostep climb wide\nopen. One of the last big challenges\nthat they face before they start to make\ntheir way back into town after Lake\nKahola gets a little bit rolling. No big\nsignificant clines or significant gravel\nsectors on the way back into town, but\nwind is the story of the day at that\npoint. Crosswinds and tailwinds will be\npushing the riders all the way back into\ntown. Highland Hill by the university,\nthe final hard section before finishing\nright back here on Commercial Street.\nThis year at Unbound Gravel presented by\nShimano, we have the biggest field that\nwe've ever had in its 19-year history.\nOver 5,000 athletes racing across all\nthe distances. It's going to be the\nbiggest day we've seen yet here in\nEmporia. And it's also stop number two\non the 2025 Lifetime Grand Prix.\nYeah, I'm ready. Yeah. Now I'm just\nexcited.\nWhat's the plan for today? Oh, trying to\nsurvive.\nYeah. No, no plans. Yeah, just trying to\nenjoy it. It's birthday. Don't forget.\nAbsolutely. I'll wish him a happy\nbirthday out there. Right.\nCurrently sitting second overall. He's\nthe champion of South Africa. Welcome\nMatt Beers,\nyour current overall leader of the\nLifetime Grand Prix. Welcome Mr. Keegan\nSwenson. Yeah.\nAnd in 3 2 1\nWell, this year we've got more\ninternational competition than ever.\nIt's been great to see almost 50% of our\nriders in attendance for our Pro Men's\nLifetime Grand Prix event coming from\noverseas. Again, that first 25 or so\nmiles relatively tame in terms of the\nFlint Hills gravel that the riders see,\nbut always a very fast pace as they make\ntheir way towards call reserve road. And\nthat opening pace that was upwards of\nabout 24 25 m an hour. And what we saw\nhappen was uh we saw a big group pacing\nkind of coming out of the uh of the\nstart there. We saw some riders with a\nlittle mishap early, but the big talk\nwas we saw a big group of roughly 15\nriders separating very\nearly. Looks like that group includes\nCam Jones, Simone Pel, Toby Reed, and\nMazwartz Schmidt. Well, if this group\nstays out in front, it could make for\nsome very interesting moves later on in\nthe race. Well, as always, one of the\nnotables in our men's field is Alexi\nVarmmulan. We caught up with Alexi\nbefore the race. Um,\nokay. The goal of today is kind of\ntwofold. One, want to be ready for rule\nof three. I want to make sure don't get\ninjured, nothing stupid happens, and\nalso can can race effectively. Got a\nlittle 55 mile ride. Um, I'm Alex McMan.\nI race bikes professionally and I'm\nprobably most well known for riding with\nmy little dog, Willie. So, racing gravel\nprofessionally in the US has changed\nquite a bit from what I grew up doing on\nthe road.\ngone from very focused racing on winning\nand that being the only focus of the day\nto the minute you're off the bike you\nhave so many other jobs. Yeah, we are\nstill answering your questions from last\ntime. Um there's always been this dream\nto create things that inspire people but\nalso educate along the way. We kind of\nhad this idea about 3 years ago about\nhow why don't we do a YouTube channel,\nlittle vlog style here, a little race\nreport there. But I was very excited by\nthis idea that you could reach people\nwho weren't at the race. And so how do\nyou give them something to interact and\nbe involved with or motivate them to\ncome the next year? It's through\ncontent.\nIt's just I really enjoy talking to\npeople. I enjoy being around the expo. I\nenjoy creating content. It's not\nstressful to me. See a lot of guys kind\nof wrapping their bars further. I think\nit's just being honest with yourself,\nknowing that, okay, I have this amount\nof time and this amount of hours to do\nthings and I need to build this week out\nso that I can be the best athlete I can\nat the end of the week. Um, while doing\nas many of these uh off the bike\nendeavors that I've been asked to\ndo going into this year, the Grand Prix\nis my entire focus. Doing other races\naround it, but they're all a chance to\nprepare for the Grand\nPrix. I think the first couple years of\nthe Grand Prix, I was just trying to\nfigure it out, see what I wanted to do.\nIt worked out. I was lucky sometimes.\nThis year, I want to put some pressure\non myself. I want to try to win it. Want\nto take down the King Keegan. Racing to\nwin is different. This also means racing\nto possibly\nlose. A lot of these races, there's so\nmany great guys now that you can't win\nby just sitting there and hoping that\nyou're the best at the finish line cuz\nit's not going to\nwork. I'd love to be going to Unbound to\nHad Keegan, but I'm not. To me, when I\nstarted this year, tactically, I said,\n\"No questions asked. I have to beat\nKeegan at Seotter or Unbound.\" That's\nthe mindset. I don't need to win the\nrace. I have to beat Keegan.\nUnbound to me is mentally tough. It is\nreally hard to focus for 10 and a half\nhours and not make a mistake. And I'm\ntalking about not hitting a rock, not\ntaking a corner wrong, not overlapping a\nwheel, getting all your food, being able\nto eat all your food. It's It's never\nending. It's a lot about luck, but it's\nat the end of the day, it's a lot about\nhow mentally resilient are you because\nsomething's going to go wrong. How do\nyou solve\nit? I think I'm most excited to just go\nout there and race. I know I'm fit. Um I\nthink always the first race of the year\nis nerve-wracking, but once you kind of\nset a pecking order, um it's just about\ngetting down to business and racing a\nbike like you know you can.\nWell, let's see if Alexi has it in the\nlegs today. Hey, what do you guys think?\nAre you ready to send our women out\nthere on courts? Ladies and gentlemen,\nLifetime Grand Prix. Welcome Sophia\nGomez\nVisha to Vamporia. Please welcome back\nPaige Onweller.\nLet's try this one more time. Hey\nEmporia, are you ready?\nAll right, now you all warmed up and\nready to go here today. Our women are\ngoing to bring in the heat out here on\ncourse. We are going to go at 6:05. So\nriders, we will give you a little count\nand and Porter, you're going to make\nnoise one more time in three, two, one.\nWe are under.\nAnd our women's race is underway. It's a\nstacked field here today and looks to be\nan exciting race. Five minutes after\nsix, so 15minute gap once again just\nlike we did last year. Oh man, what I'm\nso excited for today's race. The women\nput on a show last year. I expect the\nsame thing from them today. And as the\nwomen roll off the line, you know, and\nthen you can feel those nerves and they\ngot off to a great start and we're just\nwaiting to see what happens today at the\nfinish line. Yeah, it was a great start\nfor the women and lots going on in that\nfirst part of the women's race. We know\nthere was a couple of crashes early on.\nIt looked like nobody got really\ninjured. Most of the riders uh save one\nI think got back in the mix. Here we see\nthe crash. Uh as as you said there, we\nbelieve there was one rider who wasn't\nable to get going. Emily Newsome was one\nof the riders down who was I think the\nlast rider to get back on her bike, but\nshe did catch back up to the group. So,\nshe's now in the in the big chase again.\nI think maybe to get a little more\ninformation, we've got our friend Lauren\nHall out there following along at the\nfront of the women's race. So, we should\nprobably move on over to Lauren. And\nLauren, what is going on up there at the\nfront? We are only a couple of miles\ninto the race, guys, and we've already\nhad a touch of\nwheels, a small\ncrash. The anticipation of today has\nbeen\nso intense trying to figure out tire\nchoices leading\ninto the conditions of today. having so\nmuch\nrain the last couple of days and uh I\nthink everyone has changed over and over\ntheir tire choices. Woo! Got some\nbubbles coming through\nalready. This is going to be a great\nday. These women are flying.\nUh the real story was uh Gabby Traxel\ngetting off the front pretty early.\nMerida. Yeah. Um, but Gabby Traxxler was\nthe story of the morning as she went off\nthe front solo. Former road racer, had a\nmajor major crash in 2023, uh, has been\nable to bounce back from that and has\nnow devoted her time to gravel racing in\n24, and here she's back again in 25.\nYeah, Gabby again, so much as I think\nabout a 2 and 1/2 minute lead at one\npoint, which was which was really quite\nimpressive. Our women's chase is full of\nnotable athletes including the likes of\nPaige Onweller, Lauren de Cresenzo,\nMeisa Rollins, and many more. Meisa\nRollins is fighting in this chase pack.\nShe's a former winner of the Leadville\nTrail 100 and is set up for a huge day\nhere at Unbound. Let's hear a little bit\nfrom Me Lisa. Since winning Leadville, I\nwent from sort of being like a top 20\nfinisher to now I'm consistently\nfinishing top five or just outside of\nthe top five in every race and always\nsort of being a part of the main group\nor what's happening in the race. I\nwouldn't say that before I won Leadville\nI was not strong enough. It was just it\nwas something clicked and now I feel\nconfident and I'm ready to be a part of\nthe race. I mean before that I always\nstruggled with confidence and believing\nin myself and not really sure if I\nbelonged. Every time I saw myself on a\nstart line, I always kind of like\ncounted myself halfway in, not fully in.\nBut yeah, I\nthink sort of proving what I knew deep\ndown that I was capable of has sort of\nhelped me build confidence to know that\nyeah, I was selected in the Grand Prix\nto race because I can race and I can\nrace well. In these long, really, really\nhard races, you have to have some kind\nof like emotional attachment to winning\nbecause they're really freaking hard.\nAnd that's the deciding factor in the\nlast hour, in the last 10 miles, in the\nlast 5 miles, at the last moment, is who\nreally freaking wants it. Everyone's\ngoing to have some kind of low in the\nrace. Not every low is created equal,\nbut everyone will have lows. So, if you\ncan make it through your low the best, I\nthink that's who wins Unbound.\nIt's always great to hear from me. Lisa,\nbut before Divide Road, a group of four\nwomen broke away hunting down the\ncurrent leader, the Canadian Gabby\nTraxler.\nComing at about mile 45.5, Divide Road\npresents one of the toughest stretches\nof terrain on the entire route.\nFollowing Escridge, this roughly six\nmilei stretch is a straight shot with a\nrelentless onslaught of rough, rocky\npaths, setting the stage for the\nchallenges to come.\nLet's catch up with our men. We have\nthem screaming up front. It is now\nsingle file. They are pinned rolling in\n40 plus miles into this like they are\nfresh. Looks like Simone and teammate\nare doing a great job out front here\ntoday. Time to get some fuel. Keep those\ntanks topped off as much as possible.\nThe last few miles and kilometers there\nwas not any chance of grabbing a bottle\nor getting any hydration in. They were\nin the drops. There was no sitting onto\nthe hoods. The terrain was just too\ngnarly and the pace incredible today. So\nmuch stress on the front end of this\npointy group. So many new players. The\nEuros have come over, done their\nhomework, wanted to get out front. and\nthe rest of the experienced players\nhoping that they can keep that contact.\nBut man, it got narrow back\nthere. These two really pulling away\nright now. The remaining 18\nbehind, doing what they can to get\nhydrated, but they are losing a little\nbit of contact. This may be the break.\nAs Simone Po and Cameron Jones begin\ntheir breakaway, let's check in with the\nwomen.\nAll right, guys. We have just come\nthrough some of the muddy sections that\neveryone was checking out at uh pre-race\npre- rides. Gabby basically has her\nchoice of line selection. It looked like\nshe was running a more of a slick\nuh in the center of her tire with just a\nlittle bit of knobbyby on the edge. And\nwhen she came through that mud section\njust right there. I mean, you could\ndefinitely tell she was all over the\nroad and really fighting that bike and\ntrying to keep it upright. But again,\nthat's she would rather pay the price\nhere. Hence her part of her probably\nsome of her race strategy to be up the\nroad and be more efficient with that\nslick versus having a more knobbyby tire\nthat's going to bite more in that uh in\nthat mud. But yeah, she is still she's\njust smoking it right now.\nLikely for a bit\nas the women chase add another rider to\nthe hunt. Let's check in with the men.\nCam Jones and Simone Po are still\nleading at the front of the race, making\nit look awful easy. But the burning\nquestion is, will they be able to hold\non to this lead? Well, that's anyone's\nguess at this point. But for now, let's\ncheck in with Nat Ross just in front of\nthe leaders at the base of Christy Road.\nWe got the kiwi and the Swiss leading\nthe cows up the pasture here. They think\nthey're going to get fed, but these two\nreally breaking away from the main group\nout of\nsight. And look at the gap that they\nhave put down today. Very\ncohesive. These two breakaway\nstrategists have put it together. The\nformula is working for them in their\nfavor. Okay, at this aid 70 miles into\nthe race focus strategy. Cam looking for\nhis crew. Simone has got the BMC team\nout here ready to do a bottle handoff\nand then some. You can tell from the\nlenses on these guys that the visibility\nif they can get a swap of glasses or\nlenses they will take it more\nintritically. Here we go. Simone off\nwith the pack. Cam trying to get\nvisibility of his crew. Simone dropping\none\npack. There he goes. Look at that.\nSmooth from Joan. Got another pack. He\nis topped off, ready to go. Cam still\nlooking for his crew in the feed\nzone. And at roughly mile 70.6, Cam\nJones and Simone Po still lead the\nChasers by about 2 minutes. Heading out\nof our first feed zone, Po appears to\nslow down just a little bit for Cam to\ncatch back up so they can continue to\nwork together. Well, the Swiss veteran\nknows it's still a long way to go, and\nthe odds are better with a little bit of\nhelp.\nGabby Traxxer continues to maintain her\nlead heading into Christy Road, but the\ngap has significantly decreased.\nThe chase group has now dwindled to only\nthree, but they're reeling in our\nleader.\nAnd they pass her just before the feed\nzone at mile 70. Heading into this feed,\nthis gives us a new lead group\nconsisting of Lauren Stevens, Carolina\nMigon, and Cesaly Decker with a 2 and\n1/2 minute gap over Traxler and a\n7minute gap over the chase group.\nEmily,\nlet's touch base with Lauren and see\nwhat's going on at the front of our\nwomen's race.\nFast, dusty course. How does it get any\nfaster? Oh my gosh, we just seeing Caro\njust over cooking that corner right\nthere. Oh my goodness. Saving it. Coming\nback and yeah, you just got to think\neveryone is working well together. Even\nthough you say like P Normal, they may\nnot essentially be under they're on the\nsame kit, maybe not the same team, but\nyeah, everyone working well.\nAnd let's just stop and take a moment to\nrecognize just how amazing our athletes\nare. While leading the race, Simone Po\npulls out chain lube and offers to help\nlube Cam Jones chain while they're\nracing. Sure, it gives them an advantage\nto continue riding with a partner to\nshare the workload at the front, but\nwhat a class act.\nAll right, we're here at the notorious\nLittle Egypt, mile 104. It's a 2.3 mile\nlong section. It includes two descents\nand two climbs. And you drop down into\nthis descent first and it gets narrow\nreally quickly as you come around a\ncorner, kind of off camber corner across\nthis bridge, dive into these trees. It's\nbeautiful. It's one of my favorite\nsections. And right now there's a bunch\nof standing water right at the bottom in\nthat in that turn. Absolutely single\nfile through here. Um I remember\nactually last year uh Mate Mahoric, the\ncurrent world champion, double flatted\nright in this section, but it just\ncauses mayhem. The climbs are hard, but\nthe descents are absolutely as decisive.\nSo this is the first climb of two on the\nlittle Egypt section. It's really steep,\none of the steepest climbs on course.\nIt's really narrow, but everyone talks\nabout the rocks. Um, regardless of\nwhether all the potentially muddy\nsections on the rest of the course dry\nout or not, this part will be gnarly cuz\nit's rocky. Um, you can see just how big\nthe stones are and because uh it's\ngetting to be, you know, make or break\ntime in the race. People are getting\ntired. Line choice is really tough. A\nlot of times there's really only one\ngood line because of how rocky it is. If\nyou want to switch sides on the two\ntrack because someone else in front of\nyou is losing the wheel in front of you,\nit's going to be hard to switch lanes.\nUm, this this section is just notorious\nfor being pivotal in the race. And a lot\nof it is because of this climb right\nhere. Here come our two leaders around\nthe corner just about to enter into\nLittle Egypt. Pillow and Jones are still\nway off the front at this point. about a\n7-minute lead ahead of the Pelaton going\ninto the very same spot. And we'll jump\nback in time and see the Pelaton coming\naround that very same corner again,\nnearly 7 minutes down and trying their\nhardest to catch up to these two leaders\nwho seem absolutely unstoppable on the\nday. As our men's chase group now heads\ninto Little Egypt, we've got Keegan\nSwenson, Toby Reed, Brendan Johnston,\nIan Boswell, Yasper Oakleion, and Yurus\nAnnewenhouse. Let's see if this\nstar-studded group can make any headway\ninto catching our two\nleaders. One of those men in the chase\ngroup, the Frenchman, Ugo Du,\nunfortunately found himself just a\nlittle spent at Little Egypt and decided\nto pull out of the race. I was expect\nexpecting one better day because it's my\nbirthday today,\nbut I decided to to to don't continue\nbecause uh was uh was impossible today.\nWell, I'm sorry to hear that. What What\ndo you want to say to Axel to cheer her\non? She's very very strong. She very\nstrong. I I'm the first uh first love of\nfirst love of Axel. So, yeah.\nI will I will follow this with for sure.\nWe see Paige Onweller on screen and we\ngot a chance to catch up with Paige\nbefore the race and here's what she had\nto say.\nMy name is Paige Onweller and I am a\nprofessional off-road cyclist. I ride\nbikes fast sometimes. This is one of the\nbikes I'm going to race. This is likely\nthe race bike. Uh this is a checkpoint\nset up with two twos front and rear. Uh\nit's what we call the the beefy boy. So\nwe are about just over a week out from\nUnbound. I head there early because I\nreally like the community and I love the\nriding there. All right, bike number\ntwo. It's such a important race and an\nimportant week that you really do need a\nlot of extra time to prep everything and\nrecon. The amount of equipment that you\nneed to bring to unbound is pretty\ninsane. More wheels, more bikes. Uh,\nthis is a new bike. Me personally, I\nhave really good support. I'll be\nbringing two bikes and five wheel\nsets. That just speaks volumes to the\nequipment that you need, but also the\ncarnage of the\ncourse. You have to have your equipment\ndialed. You have to have backups. You\ngot to be ready to break anything during\nrecon week and have another ready to\ngo. In 2023, I had pretty bad mechanical\nthat ended my day. You come to expect\nthese mechanicals and you also come to\nrespect the race. I line up at Unbound\nknowing there's a chance that I have a\nday ending mechanical again. You have to\naccept\nthat it can be gut-wrenching to say the\nleast. You build your whole first part\nof the year for this race.\nSo to come back and have such a good\nyear just meant a lot. It was really\nvalidating because that race and that\ncommunity is just important to me and I\nwant to do well there. 2024 Unbound set\nthe precedent for gravel for all\nevents. Historically, gravel has always\nbeen a mass start event. So the elite\nmen, the elite women, and amateurs, we\nall start\ntogether. However, in 2024, Lifetime at\nUnbound, they did a separate start. And\nthat was the first time the women truly\nhad our own\nrace. We had a nineup sprint for the win\nat Unbound, which is amazing. We showed\nthe world how cool and how strong and\nhow dynamic like our race can be.\nIt's just a totally different\nexperience. That was the first time\nwe've ever raced together, all of the\nIn the end, I feel like we really put on\nthe show that we're capable of. Good\njob. No matter what my result would have\nbeen today, that was definitely the\nhighlight of the race. And it's just so\ncool to see the women like doing it.\nUnfortunately, Paige was dropped from\nthe chase group at just after Little\nEgypt. So maybe not the day she'd been\nhoping for. You know, every year we go\nfaster. I think there's no way we can\npossibly go faster and then it just\nhappens again. The depth of field just\ncontinues to increase. Um, all that\nsaid, I do think there could be some\nhistorically fast conditions this year.\nUh, that all that rain that we got\nmidweek. Um, like Nat was kind of\nreferencing, does create some extra\ntackiness and traction in those corners.\nUm, and even on a course like this\nthat's so long, that's so rugged, um,\nthat doesn't have as many twists and\nturns maybe as some other gravel\ncourses, um, traction still does matter.\nMomentum absolutely matters. And even\nthough those might be small differences\nover the course of 200 miles, it all\nadds up. But right now, we're looking at\nour women's the chase group. It's now\ndown to eight riders. So curious to see\nif that gap is going to come down. We\nsee G in there. We see Sophia in there\nas well. So yeah, again, we wonder if\nmaybe there's a little more unity. Maybe\nthere's a little more cohesion in there.\nUh LDC at the back of the just a rut.\nYeah, she just got sideways in a rut and\nit was uphill, too. Uh, it's devastating\nto see LDC crash like that. She's so\nwell known for her breakaway game, but\nit looks like this year may not be in\nthe cards.\nHere's the dust off. This was a prize in\n2021. This is my belt buckle. Should\nreally do something with this, like turn\nit into a belt or something. So, I am\nknown as a bit of a breakaway\nspecialist. It's my signature move, I\nguess.\nI do a lot of things that just feel\nright in the\nmoment. Just the solo\nbreakaways. Ultimately, I just really\nlike riding by myself. I\nthink I like taking the risk. People are\nscared to do it, but I like to be brave\nand embark on like 90 mile breakaway.\nHer second win at the rat. She's got to\nbe so happy with this. I'm willing to\ntake the chance and do what it takes. I\nhate placing expectations on myself\ncoming into these races. The feel is as\ndeep as ever. The competition is\nstacked. All I can do is have my own\nbest personal performance. And it's like\nRussian roulette out there. Anything can\nhappen at Unbounds. As long as I know I\ncan put it all out there, I'll be\nstoked.\nWell, getting back up from her crash,\nLDC was able to catch it back up to the\ngroup and hang on. So, well, maybe her\nday isn't over after all. Um, you can\njust have a a little crash at any\nmoment. That doesn't help the morale. It\ndoesn't help you physically. It's just\nanother barrier on top of the distance,\non top of the heat, on top of the wind,\nand on top of the competition. Let's\ntouch base with the men. The the chase\nbehind has a lot of work to do. There is\nstill a small group between Oh, we got a\ncrash here. Keegan's down. Keegan is\ndown. Jeez, that's a big blow. We've not\ntalked about him a whole lot today. And\nthis is not the way we wanted to talk\nabout him. That's the thing, you know,\nthere there are technical sections on\nthis course, but a crash like that can\nhappen anywhere. That was a dead\nstraight section of road. Looks pretty\nsmooth, and it just takes a a quick uh\nquick moment, and your race can\ncompletely change.\nSimon, you're definitely showing some of\nthe the signs of strain as well. So,\nyeah, anybody's guess right now as both\nriders wearing that fatigue uh very\nclearly on their shoulders. This is one\nof our men's chase groups and on one of\nour other camera angles a minute ago, I\nsaw one of the SWAT club guys literally\nstop pedaling and start stretching,\nwhich means cramps. Um, and it looks\nlike this main chase group has\ncompletely exploded at this point.\nWindow of opportunity is is not it's not\nclosed completely, but it's it's it's\nreally come down a lot. I mean, I think\nreally they would have had to have kind\nof lit that fire almost an hour ago at\nthis point cuz that gap was so big. And\nyou know, you know, the the shorter the\nrunway gets, the the less time you have\nto really get this done. So with our men\nnow through feed zone number two at\nCouncil Grove, Cam Jones, and Simone Po\nare still in the lead with now a\n9-minute gap over the chasing group. Our\nleading trio of women, Cararolina Migon,\nLauren Stevens, and Cesaly Decker\ncontinue to add time over our chase\ngroup through feed zone number two. That\ngap now stands at nearly 14 minutes.\nBut that doesn't last long because just\npast mile 148 is when we start to see\nsome cracks in our leading trio.\nKarolina puts down the hammer and while\nCesley tries to respond, Lauren gets\ndropped off the back. This leaves\nCarolina in the lead of our women's race\nwith Cesaly Decker trailing in second\nand Lauren getting caught by the chasing\ngroup coming up from\nbehind. The four women catching up and\npassing Lauren are last year's winner\nRosa closer, Cesily Ljun, your series\nleader Sophia Gomez, Avisha Fany, and\nLauren de Cresenzo. And you know, early\non, I always like to say early in a bike\nrace, everyone feels good, but\neventually you have to pay the piper.\nUm, and I think we're seeing that now.\nIt has become a race of in large part\ngroups of twos and threes, maybe four,\nwhich is different than last year. Yeah,\nit's it's vastly different than uh than\nany addition I've seen. You know, very\noften we see those small breakaways, but\nthen it's generally a reasonable size\nchase group coming up from behind as now\nyou can clearly see our riders going\nalong the top of the the Cahola Lake\nthere. And you know, again, a wide open\nsection there kind of on both sides. And\nso I imagine a a good bit of wind coming\nacross. It looks like they're actually\nin little bit of an echelon formation\nthere. of the wind probably coming from\nuh the right just a little bit. The\nupper right there is they're flying.\nYeah, they're moving right. It's so easy\nto see using the those cement blocks in\nthe background as an indicator.\nOkay, we're here at mile 176 on Kola\nHill, which happens to be the longest\nclimb on the course. It's about a half\nmile long. Not very long as uh compared\nto maybe some other climbs out there,\nbut you hit it really deep in the race.\nUm it looks like on Saturday it's going\nto be hot, it's going to be sunny. This\nclimb is also super super exposed. If\nit's windy, there's nowhere to hide. Um\nback in 2019, I remember actually\ncramping on this hill, even though it's\nnot that long. So, uh once once you're\nthat deep into the race, um Kola Hill is\ndefinitely really going to hurt. And one\nother cool thing about this section of\nthe course is most of the pros will be\ncatching a lot of the hundred mileers at\nthis point. And oftentimes there's a\nlong line of people even just walking up\nthis climb cheering for the pros as you\nknow we rip by trying to decide our\nrace. So uh it's a classic part of the\nUnbound course.\nWell, Kola Hill, the real deal. It is\npointing straight up. There are a lot of\nfolks going different speeds. You can\nsee the excited folks don't know what's\ngoing on. Cam, just a little bit of tap\nsaying, \"Guess what, guys? We are\nrolling through.\" Kind of like the tour,\nkind of like the Gro on those mountain\ntops. This is out in the Flint Hills.\nThese two are now trying to stay keep\ntheir momentum. What a gap they have\nover the chase. They know it. They're\ngetting their first real splits. Cam\nsoaking some stuff up. Some information.\nThese guys are thirsty. It is full\nexposure out here. Once we pass the\nlake, you could just tell the winds are\nhowling. So, filling you in from the\nfield from our perspective. One more\nhill to go. Highland Hill is fast\napproaching. That's going to be the\nfinal opportunity to use any sort of an\nincline as a springboard. And we've been\nsaying it. We think Po may be uh ready\nto play out that card, but we are going\nto see here momentarily. All right, Cam.\nIn my opinion, even though he knows he\nmight be strong in her sprint, he's got\nto assume that maybe Simon is going to\nwa Look at this. Look at this. Look at\nthis. I was just going to say he's\nriding\naway. Cam Jones with the attack right\nfrom the front. So Simon Jones wasting\nno time. Po literally no response. So\nthis is the move. Cam Jones looking back\nover his shoulder out of the saddle\nagain. A big acceleration as he's now\ncoming into that deviation area. So Cam\nJones making the moves along the home\nstraight here. And I'll tell you what,\nwe couldn't have asked for a better day\ncoming across the line with a huge win\nat the 2025 Lifetime Unbound presented\nby Shimano. Cam Jones out of New Zealand\nwill be your champion on the day. Yeah.\nComing in with a welldeserved silver\nmedal and not too unhappy about it.\nTossing a bottle to the crowd. Simon\nPalo, the aggressive rider. Tourn Road\ndoing what we know he can do. He's just\nenough in the tank. Takes one look back.\nToby Road will be your bronze medalist\nhere today with a wellexecuted sprint.\nHi everyone, I am Meredith Miller and I\nam here with Cameron Jones, your unbound\n200 men's winner. Not only did you punch\nyour ticket for the wild card selection,\nso you are now in the Grand Prix for the\nrest of the year, but you won Unbound\nwith a long se uh long range attack with\none other rider. Did you plan on doing\nthat from the very beginning? Uh I think\nlike I was saying to you yesterday, I\nwas like it's probably in my best\ninterest to play it safe cuz there's\nmore than just like the race on the\nline. there's the the chance to be in\nthe Grand Prix that could potentially\nlose if I did do sort of anything\nreckless. But I was the whole time just\nsaying, \"Who am I kidding? I'm just\ngoing to ascend it.\" Um out on my wrecky\nrides. I thought that sort of towards\nthe end of Divide Road would be a nice\nplace to be in the front. It looks like\nit last year it sat up a bit and then\nthat next little loop there's some some\ntechnical stuff. It's always nice to be\nable to ride the front and actually see\nwhere you're going. It's It's safer, so\nyou when you can see any obstacles. Um\nyeah, I end up going a bit earlier than\nthan I planned. Um it sort of was all\nstrung out coming into Escridge\nand yeah, saw Keegan and my buddy Max\nsort of chopping off at the front and I\nwent to join in the fun and then rolled\nthrough and they all stopped. So I just\nlike kept on going and um I was like,\n\"Oh, I'm committed now.\" So managed to\nbridge across to there's actually quite\na big group up the road. I hadn't really\ntaken much notice of what was going on\nand they were all spread out through\nthroughout divide road and again it was\ngood to have everything sort of in\nsingle fire and spaced out so I could\nsee where I was going and just rode\nstraight through the the initial break.\nWe've got a a great chasing group, but\nthey're uh as unified as they seem,\nthey're actually losing time still.\nLet's uh check in with Lauren Hall.\nMaybe she can give us a little more\ninsight as to how these splits are going\non up there. Yeah, Bill, you know, you\nwere talking that there was only 20, 30\nmiles left, but we are in those long\nlate miles, right? And every hill is\nreally starting to add\nup. Carol is definitely starting rocking\nside by side, taking on fuel. And when\nwe were going up and over Hill, she was\ngiven the look back because she didn't\nknow that split. I think she now knows\nthe split to that chase group. But uh\nyeah, like you're saying, always\ncognizant of what's behind you, but\nCarol is definitely pushing forward. But\nyeah, Minan still looking strong.\nDecker, her teammate back there just\nabout five minutes down in this chase\ngroup. Uh maybe they were looking pretty\nunified, now looking maybe a little less\nso as they've reeled in Stevens. And we\ntalked about uh the potential for that\nearlier. They knew three riders went\noff, but that was so many hours ago that\nuh they've caught one of them now. So\nmaybe they're kind of, you know, not\nresting on their laurels a little bit,\nbut they're like, \"All right, we we kind\nof close that chapter, so we're going to\ntake just a little bit of a breather\nright now.\" And, you know, obviously\nthat's not going to help their cause\ninto uh trying to compete for those top\ntwo positions. So, here we are on\nHighland Hill, the final incline of the\nday, and doesn't have to worry about a\nsurprise attack from anybody. You know,\ncan just ride her tempo a little bit,\nand it's going to be one of the biggest\nwins as we've got uh one of our great\nfans out there, and I bet she's looking\nat that hot dog and maybe salivating a\nlittle bit about uh what's to come here\nto enjoy the fruits of her labor. She is\ncelebrating. So, what a great champion\nout here today to cap off our women's\nelite 200mile race. Round number two of\nthe lifetime Grand Prix. Your champion\njust about to get herself across the\nline. It looks to me like there's a\nwhole lot of emotion in this finish. I\nwould imagine some tears are being shed\nbecause what a day on the bike. The\ncrowd showing their love, the hands in\nthe air well before the finish line. And\nI'll tell you what, it's you couldn't\nask for a better finish in this. 2 hours\nsolo to take the win here. Silver medal\nride on the day going to go to Cesaly\nDecker. And she's looking like uh she\ncan't even celebrate right now. She's\nshe is cooked.\nAnd here comes our women's chase getting\nready to fight it out for the third step\non the podium here at Highland Hill.\nOh, Cecile making the first move\nhere. Huge acceleration from Cecil Lune\nright now. Hard to see if anyone was\nable to follow her wheel.\nNot surprised given the way that out.\nOkay, we see the wheel there. That's\nRosa right there. Yeah, Rosa. Rosa very\nquick to react. Remember when Sophia\nattacked a while ago? Rosa was the first\none to respond to Sophia. Look at\nSophia's body language, the shoulders.\nThat would Oh, look at this. One rider\ngoing the wrong way. Rosa going the\nwrong way, making that turn. So, that's\ngoing to be uh potentially a big issue\nif if Cecil Lune. Yeah, Cecil Lune\nrealizes what happened. Waiting to see\nif Sophia makes the big move around.\nRosa not making a move. There goes Cecil\nLune up along the fencing. Lun coming\nup. That door going to stay open. It's\ngoing to be Oh, this is down to the\nwire. Sophia looks like she's going to\nhave enough. Can Rosa come on by? Oh,\nall the way to the line. That is close.\nIt looks from our vantage point like\nSophia just got that one on the line.\nWhat an amazing finish.\nHey, this is Pac McKelvin with today's\nwinner, Ko, who just finished a 40mile\nsolo, 2hour solo. Tell me about what was\ngoing through your head those last\ncouple of hours. I just thought if I was\nstupid or\ngenius. Um, yeah, I I I didn't know if I\nwill make it to till the finish. I would\nsay till last 5k\nreally you you didn't know that you had\na 18minute lead well Cesaly was maybe I\nthink six seven minutes back but to the\nthird group you had a huge lead okay I I\nwas not aware I knew that Cesily was\nback but I also know know that she's\nsuper strong\nuh and you also can have a flat you can\ncrash you never know so you were on the\ngas all the way until Highland Hill or\nwhen did you allow yourself to start\nenjoying it a little bit. Uh yeah, the\nthe last uh tarmac climb then I knew\nthat I won. Uh and I started to really\nsmiling and just just couldn't\nbelieve\nHeat.\nYeah. Nothing. I'm\ndone. Heat. Heat.\nOh\nmy. Oh no.\nH\nFire.",

and we've\ngot Olympic champion Greg van\nAlmont at lifetime we're often looked at\nas event promoters but we really view\nourselves as Community\nBuilders this year we have individuals\ncoming here from 50 states and over 40\ncountries to take on Unbound\ngravel Unbound started in the parking\nlot with 36 Riders\nwas not a big National event lifetime\ncoming on board with us in 2019 was a\nbig game changer lifetime definitely\nbelieves in building community and\nhealthy way of life and I think Unbound\ndovetails so nicely with that really\njust growing the number of emporians and\narea residents that now ride\nbikes it's a unique experience to line\nup with 4,000 people for a bike race The\nBig Show biggest gravel race on the\nplanet I want the Unbound title so bad\nthe leaders of the 200 now coming in for\na final\nSprint if you went Unbound like in a way\nyour career is made it's an automatic\nticket to the Hall of\nFame last year was just crazy I finished\nfirst it was a big surprise for me I\nhave two or three season gos so Unbound\nis definitely the biggest one so it's\nvery important for me I would definitely\nlove to improve on the the second place\nfrom from last year and there is only\none spot where I can improve I was\nthinking this is just a long race on\nreally wide gravel roads the conditions\nare completely\nunexpected it's so different to\neverything we do your whole training has\nto change your mentality definitely has\nto change there's so many factors that\nare going into play here it's like\ntrying to take control over all of those\nfactors and you just simply cannot and\nthat's the thing like this race you\nnever know it's just knowing that you're\nprepared and able to deal with that and\ndon't give\nup it's my longest ride ever I think\nso we will see but I hope to finish this\nfirst key Point that's the only thing\nI'm worried about to travel that far and\nnot finish the race\nI my impression was maybe because it was\nlike the chunky stuff that everyone was\ntalking about maybe it would drain\nbetter right that's where it could\nbetter fit the American yeah I've done\nthis before Paige Paige kept say and\nshe's like I don't know that any of the\neuroes are going to do as well as they\nthink because she's she's like gravel\nworlds last year like nothing like this\nyeah you know like just different just\ndifferent gravel in general it's like\nthis is like a little bit\ndifferent all right everyone it's dark\nand early here in Emporia but the town\nis buzzing with energy because today is\nthe day the start to the 2024 lifetime\nUnbound gravel is rapidly approaching\nand you can feel the nerves amongst all\nthe Riders out here for the elite men\nand women we will once again feature\nseparate starts and once they are all\noff the line we'll get our Mass start\nathletes rolling as well if you've been\ntuning into to the last couple years of\nUnbound gravel coverage you'll notice\nsomething different about this year's\nrace you can look at r want to look at\nit yeah that's all the layers every\ncouple of years the Unbound gravel\ncourse alternates routes in 2022 and 23\nwe sent our athletes South but this year\nit's time to change it up so we're\nheaded north this route is highlighted\nby rougher terrain punchier climbs and\nthe always unpredictable weather of the\nFlint Hills of\nKansas we caught up with some of the\nathletes to get their thoughts for the\nlifetime Grand prix's first venture into\nthe Unbound Gravel North Course the\nNorth Course has steeper climbs more\nRelentless\nrollers um and chunkier rock more\nconsistently I think it will be like\nkind of a a fast start and a bit of a\nSprint for that rough section well\neveryone say in the North Coast was like\na lot harder a lot hiler it will be all\nabout tirus and punctus I think when\nit's a mud year a lot of it is just\npicking good lines getting off the road\nsome sometimes riding in the grass\ngetting off and running putting the bike\non your shoulder if you have to it's\njust a it's survival really there's way\nmore climbing so it looks like a very\ndemanding uh demanding parkour for a\nstrong field at the start line so that\nwill very will be very\nexciting Carnage is going to happen but\noverall it's going to feel predominantly\nlike a road race with the tactics and\nyou know lead group sort of pelaton\nI feel prepared I feel excited for the\nrace and uh yeah I'm I'm ready I feel\nready okay Emporia we are just moments\naway from the start once again we will\nhave Kimo and Janelle following the\naction from the heli we will also get to\nsee Tim Johnson and Lauren Hall out\nthere following the action on the ground\nand as always our production team is\nstaged all over the course ready to\ncapture today's excitement I'm Bill\nElliston and I'll be right here relaying\nthe time splits and updates from the\nfield to keep you informed on all the\nhappenings in today's\nrace and now I can hear the heli buzzing\noverhead and we all know what that means\nseconds remain until the men cross the\nline Kemo and Janelle Have Eyes on the\nstart let's kick it out to them to watch\nthe men head out of town and make their\nway North Kimo Janelle how's it looking\nup there good morning Janelle here we\nare at the 2024 lifetime Unbound gravel\nabout to kick it\nOff 2\n[Music]\n1 they're off here Janelle here they\ngo by all accounts it is the most\ncompetitive field for both the men and\nthe women this year 145 Elite men and\nabout 61 Elite women lining up this is\nthe World Series or the Super Bowl of\ngravel so uh All Eyes around the world\nthe cycling world really focused on\nwhat's Happening Here in impor Kansas\ntoday\nJanelle and there they go our Elite men\nare underway so now of course it's time\nto turn our attention back here to the\nstart line as we count the women\nin looking at the start line of our\nElite women we're seeing a lot of former\nchamp champions of Unbound gravel last\nyear's winner Caroline Schiff is taking\nto the start line along with 2022 winner\nSophia Gomez\nbishan and the women are off for\nLifetime Unbound gravel\n2024 it's a historic race here this year\nat\nUnbound having a elite only women's\nstart um is super unique because this\nway\nuh we women can really be strategic we\ncan battle each other we can actually\nrace together um and also have\ncompletely different Dynamics um which\nallows us to be more strategic uh and\nmake the racing way more\nexciting I L we had our own start with a\ngood time time gap between the the elite\nmen and also the amateurs men it's just\nuh just amazing yeah and there you have\nit in Poria our Elite men and our Elite\nwomen women are charging forth making\ntheir way into the north course you know\nwe heard from the athletes just a moment\nago as they mentally prepared for this\nroute which is new to a lot of them most\nathletes in the Elite field have raced\nthe South course but only a handful have\nraced the\nnorth for a more in-depth look at the\ntwists and turns of the north course\nhere's race co-director Christy moan to\nbreak it down for us\nthe North Course is punchier and\nchunkier it still has mud but because\nit's rockier it tends to shed the water\nfaster and dry up a little quicker this\nyear the Riders are going to be lining\nup facing north heading north on\nCommercial Street to get out of\ntown the first 25 miles of the course\nsmooth gravel there's not a lot to break\nit up so we know that that race is going\nto be super fast leading out and then at\nMile 25 they'll hit car Reserve Road\nthere are only one to two good lines\nthrough that section so that should\nstart to break things\nup it's over 10,000 ft of climbing in\nthis 200 mile course and it's legit\nclimb after climb after climb after\nclimb after they pass through the town\nof Eskridge they will immediately\nencounter one of the hardest sections of\nthe course divide\nRoad the first checkpoint is in the city\nof Alma 70 mi into the\nrace as they start to head back South\nthe wind is going to become a\nfactor around mile 100 the Riders will\nface a couple steep climbs before\nturning onto Little Egypt Road it is a\nformidable stretch featuring more rugged\nRock double Track Road and Punchy climbs\nthat has the potential to blow the race\napart the second and final aid station\nis at Mile 149 in Council Grove like\nonce you get to Council Grove the hay is\nin the barn and you've done most of the\nhard work you've just got one last\nsignificant Hill Climb at Lake Kola once\nyou do all of that you're just on your\nway back to Emporia to the Finish Line\nIf there's a group still together then\nthey're going to work to the finish and\nwe'll see a big Sprint for sure I am\nexcited about the road closures that we\nhave we get the whole street and this\nyear the 200 MERS will have their own\nfinishing Lane it's going to free those\nathletes up to have a clear shot at the\nfinish line so um it'll be really\nspecial to watch it this year\nokay thank you Christie let's check back\nin with our heli crew Kimo and Janelle\nhow's it going out there thanks Bill\nhere in the helicopter all connected\nacross this this kind of remote course\nwith with Garmin devices allowing for\nconstant tracking and communication of\nour athletes it's the first time we've\nbeen able to have eyes on all of our\nlead Vehicles so we have a we can spot\nthe athletes we can we know where they\nare we know the where the action is\nhappening it's all thanks to Garmin\nlet's go rejoin our men's Elite field\nhey thanks Janelle thanks Kimo mile 25\nthis is K Reserve Road the rocks are\nbigger the gravel is sharper so we have\nsome early breakway Riders Kad from\nDenmark who is the first one to go\nfollowed by Chase\nwar in a in a tanky the Russian Rider\nwho's well known to the US gravel scene\nand Adam Roar who is really kind of a\njoker in this situation because he does\nhave the legs to make it 200 and so he's\ndecided he's not going to wait around\nfor Keegan Swenson Monte Morris Greg V\naot and all the rest of the Grand Prix\nRiders so this is a really good move I'm\ninterested to see how long they're going\nto be able to last\nfor the thing about this race especially\nthis year because How deep the field is\nand how many fast Riders there are is\nthat things are so tense in the first 40\nmiles\nKimo this is an incredible shot of our\nmen's field Adam RAR cresting two hills\nin front of the elite men's pelaton and\nthis is also a great way to see how this\ncourse can be death by a th000 cut one\nsteep roller at a\ntime so those first 28 miles I would say\neveryone's focused on trying to save\nenergy Not Crash but as we approach that\n28 mile whole shot the pace just\ngradually gets going more and\nmore out there in the men's field we\nhave Jonas orid and Tobias kongstad in\nfront inoen zavo and Chase War behind\nthem Adam Rober is solo and then the\nrest of them grouped up there giving\nChase we've hit the North End of This\nEast car Reserve road we've been talking\nabout how chunky and Technical it's\ngoing to start to get up here and you\ncan see they're uh they've started to\nstring it out there's races within the\nrace and the races within the race are\nfighting for position into these\ntechnical Rocky sections where you know\npeople are going to have Mechanicals\nthere's going to be crashes and because\nit's narrower The Field's going to get\nreally strung out it looks like it might\nbe John Borman there on the front but\nsitting on second wheel riding a smart\nrace uh barin Victorious is mate mahor\nour current gravel world champion second\nwheel just try to survive the first part\ncome to checkpoints try to fix the\npunctures and then yeah um if we are\nthere in the select group in the and\nthen we can we can start racing so\nJanelle we're following Jordan schle\nhere who has missed this front selection\nit looks like he's chasing back on I\ndon't know if he had a flat or some\ntechnical uh issues but he is with Team\nammani first time in the grand PR and\nhe's done a number of our events over\nthe last couple years but you can see\nJordan really working hard to try and\nBridge back\nup our team over at Cole collab our\nproduction team was able to spend some\ntime with Jordan let's see what he had\nto say this week\nI'm by name of j s and I come from\nUganda team Amani is a team in East\nAfrica around a place called\nEan that's where the team lives and we\nhave lots of athletes uh from Ethiopia\nUganda Kenya Randa as well in DRC\nKong teani it give them opportunity to\naccess International races and to\nshowcase on what they can do on the\nbike we want to be the best athletes\nback home but still we want to compete\nwith the best as well so that we get to\nknow where we are when I heard about the\nlifetime Grand preer it was pretty\nexciting stuff you know if you come to\nthe States you know the competition is\nreally high you know you get to meet\nlike cool new people in the\nC and you need to really train more so\nthat things work out at the\nend my goals this yet Unbound to finish\nstrong you know I only need to finish\nstrong healthy as well you know get good\nresults and try to score more\npoints you know and see if things will\ngo well at the end that's the only way I\ncan show people back home you know if\nyou do something really good in a right\nway things will suddenly change you know\nso I do right for Change and that really\nputs me in a position of like push push\npush push every time and represent my\nfamily in my country as\nwell you the mission of Team ammani\nthey're doing just a phenomenal job and\nyou know now here we got we got you know\nJordan schle with Team ammani over here\non the world stage it's pretty cool to\nsee this happening coming out of East\nAfrica thank you Kimo and Janelle and\nTim for that look at the men's field as\nthey continue north towards checkpoint\none let's swoop back and check in with\nthe elite women Lauren Hall is on the\nground riding alongside Lauren how's the\nearly race shaking out for the women\nall right guys we are here within our\nfirst hour of racing of our Elite women\nhere in Unbound and we've already seen a\ncrash uh didn't look like anything too\ndangerous everyone has gotten back in\nthe group but that's just this racing\nright here as you get a little bit of a\nlull and something like that happens\nwhen you're not expecting\nit Janelle we're back with the lead\nElite women and is a pretty good group\nworking together same crew near the\nfront that we saw when we left a little\nbit earlier I see Lauren D crescenzo\nsitting there on the left left hand\nside when you don't know where the move\nwill happen you are constantly making\ndecisions because every time you chase a\nmove you're burning a match that you're\nnot going to get\nback the front of the women's\npelaton making her move you know chemo\nEmily has a strong history in time trial\nand you can see from her pedaling style\nshe is committed to this move and in 200\nmiles the amount of matches you have\ncompared to that distance it doesn't\nmatch up you have to be super\nintentional with your\nenergy Laur crescenzo out of the saddle\npulling the women's field back to our\nlone leader Emily\nNome 20 Riders back Sophia Gomez visha\nwith Haley Smith sitting just off to her\nleftand side I have to look around with\nso many other Riders like what are they\ngoing to do is that tactic but you also\ndon't want to waste all your energy in\nthe beginning because you know what's\nstill coming and they have reeled in\nEmily Nome just as car Reserve Road\nstarts to get rough these women are\nready for the decisive sections of this\ncourse it's imperative to be at the\nfront and that's what they're doing paig\nonweller and Danny shasby on the front\nlot uh European girls come over and I\nknow from the last races that they are\npretty strong know Janelle pretty cool\nto see Danny shy come over here from the\nUK UK gravel National Champion was\nworking a full-time job and you know\nflying back and forth all last year for\nthe uh for the Grand Prix sounds like\nshe's got enough support to be able to\nbe over here and race fulltime this\nyear one of the greatest things about\nUnbound gravel is how it really is a\nHomeTown race and Danny has such a cool\nstory about her host house family from\nlast year and you know they have a\n14-year-old daughter who Dany after\nmeeting last year has mentored uh\nthrough her Nika mountain bike program\nand and the 14-year-old bente is racing\nUnbound 100 today last year basically me\nbeing the unorganized Brit and not\nreally aware of how busy Unbound gets\ntwo weeks before message the lifetime\nteam like guys I've not got any\naccommodation they were like oh like\nyou're going to struggle and then back\ncome reached out to me and was like oh\nthere's a family from the local cycling\nteam they'll host you they welcomed me\nin with open arms I think I remember her\ncoming up the driveway and I was like\nshe's here she's here she's here we\ninstantly all got on didn't we the girls\nmade amazing like sign on the driveway\nfor me they're chiropractors so like\nevery day they're like do you want your\nbody readjusting and then every morning\nthey're like do you want pancakes and I\nwas like whoa I've done well here this\nis the\ndream the Young daughter did the 100\nmiles last year and she was 14 years old\nI think back when I was 14 I didn't\nthink I could do 100 miles especially on\ngravel we not only get to bond over like\nsilly things like nails but she also can\nhelp me like figure out my plan for\ncycling it's just always really fun\ngetting to work with\nher yes I remember that they were like\nyou have to stay with us every year that\nyou come to Unbound so yeah I'm back\nwith them this\nyear I think you're even better preps\nthis year in the race you can just think\nabout pacing it don't go off too\nhard I just like to offer them as much\ninsight as I can but at the same time\nthey're so young just do what she feels\nmost proud of for herself enjoy Sport\nand then you'll probably love it\nmore so as our women continue working\ntheir way North the lead men are about\n30 m or so from the first first\ncheckpoint Tim Johnson is on the ground\nwith the men how's it looking out there\nTim a little bit of an update from here\non the ground Lots going on in the race\nwe got our fourman Breakaway still with\na big big lead the lead of the peleton\nhas been moving back and forth lots of\nattacks they went through the first\nwater station in ESD no one stopped for\nwater everyone was prepared to keep on\nthe gap G all the way through there when\nthe field is so deep there will be more\npeople in the front group deeper into\nthe race it's just hard for the elastic\nto actually\nsnap really the first part of the race\nthat we've seen trouble hit multiple\nRiders at the same time putting our\nyoung Slovenian from Bahrain Meridia\nteammates amte moric so he just lost one\nteammate in his been to help him win up\nout gravel I am honestly not scared but\nI have a huge respect for no I'm\nactually also a little bit scared to be\nhonest like I have huge respect for a\nride that is almost 10,000 K like my\nbiggest ride this far was 6,000 calories\nso this will be like almost double\ntraditionally at a race like Unbound the\ncourse is so hard that the course takes\ncare of the selection with a field this\ndeep it's the front Riders they have to\nforce the race they have to force the\nsplits the terrain alone won't do it\nanymore so the word on the street is\nthat on the other side of divide road we\nhave a lead group of four behind them we\nhave another small group that has split\noff and then about a minute behind them\nis the rest of the men's\npelaton our lead men have survived the\nDivide they're at M 61 and they're about\n9 miles away from our first official\ncheckpoint of the day you know seeing\nLin come to the front like this he's\nbeen known to take a flyer here there\nhe's never afraid to race aggressively\nyou use the hills or you use the rough\nsections or you try and use the wind to\nthin the group out and get it to a more\nmanageable size rarely are you going to\nsee him sit in the entire day he'll he\nloves to go to the front and animate the\nrace on this side of\nme thanks dude where's my bag Dude\nwhere's my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] bag where's my Feed\nBag dude out\nyou I just wanted use let's go baby\n[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] kill him bring that give me that\nRed Bull next time yeah yeah I love you\nguys love you baby get it ice cream just\ngel's ice cream Red Bull ice creams are\nmelted right here\nMatt fine yeah it feels hard you have to\nfeel\nhard in race mode of course but they\nwere in and out of here fast\nso there you saw it our men's field has\ncleared checkpoint one we saw those\nflyers early on they have since joined\nup to create a lead group of four that's\nTobias kongstad Jonas oret inoen\nzaveloff and Chase War about four\nminutes behind them you have Sebastian\nshanberg Yan balance Ty zoval Connie\nlucer and John Borman and after that\nthere's everybody else Tobin Orton blad\nhas been in that front group all day\nkeeg Lin vacx Brendan Johnson Chad haga\nPete STNA Pac just to name a\nfew now let's turn our attention back to\nthe women's field as they make their\napproach into checkpoint one Lauren Hall\nis out there how's it looking\nLauren we are right here on course mile\n63 headed towards checkpoint one in Alma\nall together all back together we've had\nSophia with her front flat Chase back on\nwith a group of seven we've a couple\ndangling right off the bat but for the\nmost part the gang's all\nhere that's always uh a hard decision to\nfind the right balance\nbetween supporting a group because it's\nalways good for yourself to have a group\nand to go faster Carolyn really loves\nracing over here she owns a bike shop in\nin Germany and and still works full-time\nso uh cool to see her come back this\nyear she's made a name for herself since\nretiring from the\nand putting all of her energy into\ngravel but always you always need to\nlook for yourself to save energy and to\nnot invest too\nmuch and uh really made a name for\nherself winning last year sitting on her\nwheel right behind her another past\nwinner Lauren D crescenzo won two years\nago out here and then just uh not too\nfar in front of her is a winner from\nfrom just two years ago Sophia Gomez\nvishaan so we've got the three most\nrecent past champions all in this lead\ngroup I'm I think I'm not too selfish so\nI always look also at others that they\nare having a good life in the\nrace Kemo in the history of Unbound I\ncan't ever remember a group of women\nthis big rolling into the first\ncheckpoint together you know it's cuz\nit's never happened we're really hoping\nwith this separation that it creates a\npositive environment for the women to\nhave their own race\nare we\ngood looking fast man they came in here\nin a hurry that was\ncrazy so there you have it the women's\nfield having a proper women's race as\nthey pulled into Alma you have Hannah\nutto leading the charge Heather Jackson\nSarah Sturm Miner minagawa paig onweller\ngirri is shrew Danny shury Rosa closer\nCaroline Ren Anna Hicks carollyn Schiff\nSophia Haley Alexis LDC they're all in\nthere that's a lot of Firepower in the\nwomen's lead group now we're going to\nstick with the women for a moment as\nLauren follows them out of checkpoint\none what you got\nLauren mile 74 Anna Auto pushing the\npace leading the way wanted to be up\nfront for the MMR Road section it was\nreal greasy muddy and who was on her\nwheel Sarah firm they get up and over\nthe climb Sarah wants to push the pace\nHannah's not too keen on it and Whitney\nAllison closing the Gap and who's on her\nwheel Hern ship last year's winner you\nhave to use the course to Advantage and\nespecially a course like this it can be\nchallenging because the speed is already\nso high and at some point the speeds\nstart to feel maxed out which means you\nhave to use things like technical\nterrain corners and the climbs but it's\nalso helpful to know what's coming up\nand where and how challenging the next\nclimb is going to\nbe okay Lauren thank you can't wait to\nsee how that race plays out now I\nbelieve Kemo and Janelle are back on\nwith the men as they are about halfway\nthrough today's race Kimo and Janelle\ntake it away we are rejoining the men's\nfield as they come through the famed\narea Little Egypt climbing up they've\ngot three or four more sections of\nlittle Egypt here that are going to be\nreally treacherous to get through\nwithout any kind of damage to their\nbikes it's a constant game of analysis\non what's Happening and how how guys are\nlooking and body language and who you\nthink might be playing a poker face\ngoing through Little Egypt\nKeegan not being shy about his purpose\nhere today swallowing up that lead group\nof four knowing your competitors at this\npoint knowing their strengths and\nweaknesses is and also knowing about\nwhat you think they will do based on\ntheir actions in the past sounds like\nthat lead group those four guys that\nwere five minutes at at the first\ncheckpoint have been caught and now the\nmen's field is all together in one group\nP Melvin great to see him up here taking\na pull Pete STNA right on his\nwheel this one's going to be a little\nmore interesting that we have you know\nsuch an influx of high Cali European\nPros changes the dynamic completely\nthey're about to make a leftand turn\nthey they' made it through Little Egypt\nfairly\nsafely that mate moric flatted in the\nreally tough Creek Crossing of little\nEgypt he did not Crest the hill with\nthat League group we might have lost our\ngravel world champion but we've got a\nreally heavy hitting group here in the\nfront about 24 riders in this lead group\nof\nmen earlier it was Adam roer this looks\nlike Dylan Johnson with the super arrow\nmove on the handlebars making his move\noff the front of the\ngroup looks like Chad hog on his wheel\nhe's Another World Tour Rider that made\nthe switch over to gravel and has come\nback to give a shot at get lifetime\nUnbound gravel Lin Morton also finding\nhis way to the front of this\ngroup what we're seeing is that the\nfront end of this field maybe there's\nsix Riders who are doing the work right\nbut you can't drift to far back cuz even\nif you see the move happening you'll be\ntoo far back to actually go with it our\nGarmin Baja tread XL race Edition is\ninforming me that our men's field is\napproaching the water Oasis at Mile 113\nlooks like they're going to roll right\nby the water stop and keep on going\nthey're they're going to be content to\nwait till they get to their crews out at\nuh Council Grove from the water Oasis at\nMile 112 we're heading back out on\ncourse to find our lead\nwomen mile 90 we've just gone through\nthis beautiful Creek Crossing LDC Lauren\nde cenzo is off the front with over a\nminute Gap uh Pelon is charging and\nChase with Heather Jackson leading\nfollowed by Sophia viaan and right\nbehind her we have all the hitters\neveryone lined out ready to go looking\naround seeing how everybody's feeling my\npast experience with patience is it's\nit's something I've always been working\non I just have to remind myself\nconstantly like just wait wait\nLauren I\nrace sometimes too much with my\nheart and there she is Lauren decenzo\nour solo leader cresting volun Hill\ngreat to see this returning champion of\nthe Unbound 200 off the front solo so\nLauren is uh you know our 2021 winner\nhere at at lifetime Unbound gravel and\nuh she's coming back from a traumatic\nbrain injury about seven eight years ago\nwe're going to do a little piece a\nlittle bit of story on her from our\nfriends over at Cole\ncollaborative and I think I see a smile\nI actually think I see a crack of a\nsmile on Lauren's face and a big\ncelebration at the Finish Line I am\nLauren de cenzo also known as LDC around\nthese parts your Unbound 200 winner\nLauren de cenzo takes the win for\n2021 that was the biggest one in my\ncareer and it was really\ncool it allowed me to return to\nprofessional\ncycling in 2016 I suffered a nearly\nfatal traumatic brain injury at a road\nrace where you know I had to be take\nayed to the\nICU woke up in a rehabilitation center I\nthought I was done with cycling I told\nmyself I don't ever want to see a bike\nagain but once I was discharged that\nfeeling didn't last for very long\nbecause I I really love riding my\nbike so when I did get back on the bike\nand I had the opportunity to race I now\nsee a huge difference between pain and\nsuffering over the next two years I used\ncycling more as like a measuring stick\nthroughout my recovery I really just\nwanted to return to where I was before\nthe crash and I was able to do that and\nthen get even better and better and\nbetter senzel right now currently\nsitting second still out out on course\nthe recovery from the traumatic brain\ninjury was like the hardest thing I've\ndone in my entire life so now though\nlike on my bike when like it starts to\nhurt I have to remind myself that this\nisn't suffering it's temporary some\npeople like to think that I've lost my\npain receptors it's a rumor going around\nthe\npelaton that's helpful here at\nUnbound in 2022 I raced Unbound for a\nthird time got second place the field\nkeeps getting deeper and deeper every\nyear and it's getting faster and\nfaster sorry I'm like that's okay this a\nlong\nday last year I came back again but it\ndidn't go so\nwell Lauren cenzo she's in 37th right\nnow so this year after everything I've\nbeen through to return to the North\nCourse where I literally got my life\nback it means everything and I'm here\nfor my sweet sweet\nredemption if I could go back in time\nand not be in that crash I don't know if\nI would I think it made me the person\nthat I am\ntoday and damn we got a race now you\nguys we've got 11 chasing LDC still\nwe've had Sophia with another puncture\nwe've had Rosa closer with a crash and\nshe's made it back we have got a race\nyou guys Hannah Auto in second wheel\nJenna Reinhardt Haley Smith and herica\nshoters looks like right on her whe we\nstill got Sarah Sturm and uh that might\nbe that looks like Alexis scarta sitting\non stery Wheel right now and behind her\nis um Caroline Caroline shift Heather\nJackson coming through man if we ever\ngot a star studded field here as we head\nup this hill and get ready to make the\nturn to drop down into that Infamous\nLittle Egypt climb jel one of the best\nthings we're seeing here today we're\nseeing a women's race when a former\nwinner goes off the front it is\ndangerous you want to ideally eliminate\nthem from the final selection and one of\nthe ways you can do that is to Tire them\nout just let them cook out front Give\nThem Enough hope that they can do it\nthat they keep pushing but keep them\nwithin reach that you know within the\ngroup anytime we want to catch them we\nwill we know all about her capabilities\nand that she is a very strong solar\nRider Lauren cenzo climbing out a little\nEgypt grinding through some of the\nroughest Flint gravel that we've seen\ntoday if someone asked me if that was a\ngood idea to take a flyer with 130 miles\nto go I would say that's a terrible idea\nbut if I ask myself that question I\nwould say yeah go for it might be a\nlittle early to be taking this kind of\nflyer she could win this thing on 110\nmile Breakaway that would be pretty epic\nbut you got to think that this strong\ngroup of women that we've got such an\nElite field they've got a pretty good\nchance to bring her back at some\npoint turns out I'm actually kind of\ncrazy\n[Laughter]\nwe have some big moves here in the men's\nElite race it looks like our twom man\nBreakaway Chad hagga tyon zelt have been\njoined bridging across a gap that was\nprobably sitting about 45 seconds is the\nlockin\nMorton I'm looking back and I don't see\nthat group anywhere so looks like a\nreally good mood from Lin it's a bit\nearly about 100K to go 60 miles but if\nanyone can keep on and hang all the way\nto the line it's going to be\nlock to do a move by yourself is\nincredibly difficult uh because there's\njust high speed you know and if you have\nsomeone else with you um that makes a\nreally big difference so the hardest\npart of making a move like that is is\ncreating the initial separation\nBreakaway of three is really working\nwell together we are still pretty far\nout from the Finish but the thing that's\ngoing to make the difference is whether\nor not they work well together we just\nsaw Lan Morton handing a gel to\ntaal but I think if you're trying to to\nwin you have to make moves like\nthat and that Gap is now well over a\nminute maybe even two at this point so\ngreat start to this break away the\nbigger the group gets the the less\ncohesion there is it's extremely\nchallenging to to be in a situation like\nthat where there is so much infighting\nwithin the the chase group um and\nthere's so little cooperation but it is\nroad racing 101 that Breakaway of three\nzille flatted leaving just Lin and\nchadaga but right now they have a minute\n45 second lead over Chase group of a\nabout 15 16 Riders you can see that some\npeople it gets into their mind that oh\nnow not everybody's working together and\nI think it is super super frustrating\nfor a lot of people these guys are\nworking together nicely and really look\nsmooth Chad haga a longtime road racer\non 12 grand Tours he's a two-time second\nplace at the US TT Nationals and\ndefinitely a a dark horse considering he\nhas not done much gravel race\nseen there are some strong guys back\nthere that can chase him I wouldn't ride\noff the likes of Keegan and Matt beers\nand finy and that crew back there\nthey've got a strong group Matt\nbeers hitting the win for what could be\nthe first\ntime always eager to throw down beers\ntakes one of many strong pulls at the\nfront of the chase group here at Mile\n140 we can see the power file shared\nfrom his Garmin on this climb he's\nsitting at 500 plus Watts causing some\nseparation to shbg the rider in white\nwith red helmet Keegan Swenson digging\ndeep on the wheel but ready to\nimmediately take over the\nChase he is a he is an absolute diesel\nengine and he's a guy that in a race\nlike Unbound this fits him really well\nwe mentioned earlier he won Cape epic\nthis year came over a couple weeks later\ngot third at Sea oted and U we're really\nhappy to see see Matt back here racing\nwith us this year I mean when you mark\nlike that it's just whatever you do the\neyes are on you from all the competitors\nyou just constantly have guys ready to\njust jump on your wheel but yeah that's\ncool I'm appreciative that people think\nI'm good enough thank you my friend yeah\nno worries it's a tricky one this race\nit takes a lot out of you the training\nfor it you know you kind of have to do 7\nto 9 hour rides with efforts and stuff\nrides that kind of replicated I was out\nin Tucson with Keegan and Russell sopia\nand no better place to kind of train\nthan out there in the desert in like\n100° every\nday so as the men are closing in on\ncheckpoint two Matt beers and Keegan and\nthe rest of that deep group of riders\nonly have about 50 mil left to chase\ndown llan and Chad\nhagga the front of our men's field has\nreached checkpoint two at Council Grove\nand with that we're going to take a look\nat the overall leaderboard of course Lan\nand Chad hagga are in front behind them\nit's the big group including sha Berger\nAdam robar Pete STNA Keegan Greg van Aid\nis in there finy kongstad Toby road\npacon is hanging in the Johnson's Dylan\nand Brendan Matt beers Lance heit Jonas\nonet and Zack Calton the next pack of\nelite men is about a minute or so behind\nthem\nnow let's turn our attention back to the\nwomen last we saw it was a big pack\nchasing a solo leader in Lauren de\ncrescenzo Lauren Hall is out there to\ncatch us up on whether or not that is\nstill the case what's the latest out\nthere Lauren got 11 Chasers still\nchasing LDC about a 1 minute Gap the hit\nStars here we\ngo uh when you do bring back a flyer it\ndemotivates the group um to sometimes\ntake another fly after it because the\ngroup is now aware that it's strong\nenough to close down this\nflyer it's all back together they've\ncalled LDC and they've dropped one\nthey've dropped Jenna Reinhardt from the\ngroup it's just attrition at this point\nand there's so much left to\nrace we just caught back up with the\nlead women and uh looks like we've got a\ngood group together here look who's\nsitting last wheel Lauren de\ncrescenzo see Lauren uh pretty labored\nthere trying to stay on the back of this\ngroup when the group catches you it's\ndemoralizing because you know how much\nmore energy you spent than they just did\nrolling up to you in a big group you\njust got to park yourself at the back of\nthat\ngroup this kind of racing that we're\nable to see this is just such a joy and\na thrill to be able to watch the women\nrace like this today\nKimo look at this Rosa closer looking\nlike she is nursing a pretty significant\nfront flat at the moment just 5 miles\nout from the second checkpoint at\nCouncil Grove see if she can make it in\nlip it in on that flat tire and get a\nquick quick wheel\nchain there we go Sarah\nSarah G Sarah Sarah SAR\nSAR you need chain\nm t table\ntable two bottles and food thank you you\nwant nice can I put in your put in my\nback put in my back thank\nyou and now our women have cleared\ncheckpoint two as you saw it's still one\nbig group out in front we've got paig\nonweller Geck is shors Hannah utto Haley\nSmith Carolyn Schiff Sarah Sturm Heather\nJackson Sarah Lang Alexis scarta LDC and\nRosa closer in that lead group of 11\nabout four minutes back we have Jenna\nReinhardt then Danny shury and Tiffany\nCromwell are minute behind Jenna Sophia\nGomez vishaan is back in 16th Place\nabout 11 minutes off the leaders and now\nbefore we join back with the men Kimo\nand Janelle have a quick message for us\nso Janelle you can see our new partners\nout here at the top of cola Hill kinetic\nketon working with us yeah I can't get\nover how refreshing this kinetic is yeah\nit's science based flavor forward just\nlearned that it has they've got three\npatents on this it's a great product so\nopen it's going to take us through to\n202 miles to the Finish Line in Emporia\na lot of work in this helicopter today\nwe got to get our ketones in that's\nright Cheers\nCheers loin more than welln to the\nlifetime Grand Prix followers 32 years\nold an Australian living in Northern\nCalifornia best known for riding the\nentire tour to France route including\nthe gaps between the start finishes of\neach stage by himself 5,000\nkilometers he's one of those riders that\neveryone knows L Morton in his bright\npink EF easy post outfit at the front\nbut unknown his comp Patriot on the\nfront is the American Rider 35 years old\nChad hagga he just retired from a\n12-year career as a world tour Rider\nit's ridden 18 grand Tours that's tour\nto France Tour of Italy tour of Spain\nthis first Unbound he's been racing some\nof the European gravel races but takes\nan American to do well over there and\nshow them how to get this gravel thing\ntogether\nbut it would take an incredible\nbike rider to ride that distance to the\nfinish line by themselves sure someone\ncould do it but I don't have that\nability I needed\nsomeone Lin Morton and Chad haga that's\nbeen close to 30 miles they've been off\nthe front just under 20 miles to the\nFinish I mean the work they're doing the\nwork lock is doing sitting on the front\nis just unreal they must have put in a\npretty hard effort to break away from\nthose guys and uh it's been pretty\nimpressive to see them stay away\ngood on for these guys for having this\nbe potentially the race defining\nmove I wonder how they're going to play\nthis out are they going to work together\ntill the very last minute and then have\na Sprint or are we going to start to see\na little bit more of that should I go\nnow big bomb attack try and go early and\njust get some\nseparation this is really incredible\nthey are 2 minutes 30 down right now\nokay how am I going to actually try and\nwin this thing the rider who you know\nyou've been sharing work with and\nessentially has been a teammate switches\nto being okay this is now the\nenemy Toby Reed pulling through Greg van\naat now on his\nwheel we're hearing that Matt beers and\nKeegan Swinson have been dropped from\nthe chase group Kemo we have found\nKeegan\nswon he has about 3 minutes and 20\nseconds to make up on the chase group he\ndoes not look very good right now like\nhe's rocking around on the bike doesn't\nlook like he's going that fast and so I\nthink he must uh you know maybe he's got\nsome nutritional maybe some cramping or\nor he might have just had a mechanical\nand he's just trying to claw his way\nback these are some strong performances\nthat we're witnessing today and it's\ngoing to be an exciting\nfinish I always find it hard to break\nthat stal mate you know like you kind of\nruining the Friendship whoever first\nattacks L Morton just get the smallest\nseparation and an attack from Chad haga\nsensing his moment Chad hagga has opened\na small grab but llan is not giving up\nis not panicking in anyway on the bike\nbut look at the speed from Chad haga he\nshowed his cars he showed didn't want to\nwait for a Sprint Lin Morton now he\nknows exactly what he's dealing with\nChad hog is getting a little bit more\ntactical he's trying to get Lockwood\nback to the front but the person who\nattacks first immediately changes the\ntone closing that Gap can be a huge\nconfidence booster cuz you realize you\nhave the legs and in a situation where\nthey've caught you by surprise you know\nso essentially you've had to make a\nbigger effort you match that effort I\ndon't want to get shocked your surprised\nby the guy coming around you and you\ndefinitely want to be the one coming\nfrom behind but look at Chad looking\nover his right shoulder he keeps looking\nhe keeps looking how is this going to go\nwho's going to go first it's going to be\na Counterattack or is it going to be in\nthe last couple hundred yards and we\nactually get a fullon Sprint Highland\nHill Lin out of the saddle and here he\ngoes up the right hand side of the road\nChad hega looking to close that Gap as\nquickly as possible 's got a nice little\nGap going here haga is is not giving up\nLin Morton out of the saddle Chad haga\nclosing down that Gap to llin Morton\ncomes on to terms and it is going to be\na tight Sprint to the finish here in\nEmporia\nKansas Lin out of the Lin out of the\nsaddle coming around Chad here he is\nfinal Sprint looks like Lin's going to\nbreak away from him he's going to get\nwin and it looks like it is llin [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]\nyour 2020 before Lifetime Unbound gravel\nChampion roin\n[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Chad hogga realizing at 50 m it\njust wasn't to\nbe we've got a big chase group they were\nonly about 2 and a half minutes\nbehind tobia con Peter havoc and Matteo\nde\nMarie you know how the the finish line\nis and when you turn left into the\nboulevard you just want to start\nsprinting but you know please wait a\nwait a little bit and you can see them\ncoming and then be like wait a little\nbit and then you try again\nhere they comes in a full on Sprint for\nthird\nplace Tobias Kad he's going to walk away\nwith a well-earned third\nplace Peter havoc in fourth and Matia\nDem Mari in\nfifth it looks like our Rio Olympic gold\nmedalist in seventh Greg and\naont and Cas M Elvin with a phenomenal\nride I got to Sprint to the line with\nGreg vmont today he's won Perry R and\nwon the Olympics like I'm literally\nliving my\ndream what a spectacular finish to the\nmen's race but it's not over yet last we\nheard that lead group of women was\nholding strong after checkpoint two if\nthat holds we're in for another exciting\nfinish here at Unbound gravel let's send\nit back out to Lauren Hall to get the\nlatest from the women's\nfield all right mile 178 we've just come\nover CA climb where Paige onwell set a\nblistering Pace dropped Alexa Scara and\nSarah L rosaer has made it back to the\ngroup this is the group we're taking to\nthe Finish Line what are we going to\nhave here today is Sprint\nfinished with 15 miles to go though our\nlead group of women is still nine Riders\nstrong when you're in a big group it can\nget quite challenging to get away solo\nafter you already experience that the\ngroup is willing to chase you're looking\nat everyone else trying to convince\nyourself that you're the strongest\nlooking for any moments of weakness the\nLDC taking a gel right now and um think\nthey're all preparing for uh what's\nwhat's to come there comes a point in\nthe race when everyone realizes it's\ngoing to be a Sprint finish and then the\nplaying starts what's everyone going to\ndo is someone trying to make a final\nattack sometimes it can also be the\nstrategy to just ride the hills really\nfast and and to try to get rid of people\none by one they've just turned onto the\npavement this could be the first ever\nBunch Sprint to decide who is going to\nbe crowned the queen of gravel here in\nKansas happening G and Carolyn are\ntrying to get Lauren to work and she's\nnot she and they're basically saying\neverybody else is working except you\ndon't be as big sorry\nfound there is so much tension that is\nbuilt we've all been working through\ntogether 10 hours but at some point that\ncamaraderie ends and all of a sudden you\nrealize it's every woman for\nthemselves my plan was to be in the back\nof the pack cuz you never want to leave\nfor a\nSprint Sarah Sturm taking that rightand\nb in first wheel Carolyn shiff on her\nWheels hery shures still in great\nposition doesn't want to get pinched off\nin this upcoming left-hander\njust narrowly taking that line in front\nof hercke shes 500 met to go Rosa closer\nout on the outside as Carolyn shift\nstarts to come up on the left hand side\nSarah Sturm still holding an\nadvantage Unbound grappling andoria this\nis a nine of Sprint nine of Sprint who\nwill take it to the finish line it looks\nlike Rosa closer takes this\nwin edging out G shers in second place\npaage awell with an incredible comeback\nride\nwith an incredible come back ride in a\nPodium\nfinish\ntravel oh my God I can't believe it I\nhonestly thought my race was over I had\nlike a flat tire but I had an insert so\nI was going 30k on the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] insert\nbut it was so dangerous at one point\nthat I had to\nstop with our top three Riders of the\nday oh I can't think of a better way to\nwrap up our women's professional 200\nmile event a very deserving winner here\ntoday Rosa closers edging out G shers\nand Paige onweller in third place\ncongratulations to all of these Elite\nwomen I'm 12 weeks post anle surgery\nyesterday I'm super jazzed with where my\nfitness is at right now

lifetime\nUnbound gravel Champion Rosa\ncloser the entire program event and\nschedule around it make it such a\nvaluable and insightful event that I\ndefinitely want to\nback that was feeling really good out\nthere bang hit a rock and it's drama\nfrom there H it's really\ndisappointing the level has increased\nI'm getting older I honestly didn't have\nthe self-belief that I could do this\nit's yeah it's really\nsatisfying my first Unbound the field\nwas stacked and it was just super Punchy\nthe first half the race and then lockin\ncame across so we just went pull for\npull the rest of the day had a by PR at\nend well there you have it stop two of\nthe lifetime Grand Prix is officially in\nthe books in the overall standings\nthere's been some changes in the top\nthree for the men Keegan

          "transcript": "After 6 months of preparation, I've\nfinally made it to Unbound, the toughest\ngravel race in the world.\n[Music]\nI've done over 350 hours worth of\ntraining, and I'm here to race the pros.\nAll that stands between me and the\nfinish line is 200 miles of the most\nbrutal gravel terrain.\nBut can I actually finish it? And do I\nstand any chance of a good result? Well,\nthere's only one way to find out. Yeah.\nWell, good luck and I hope as well and\num yeah, to speak to you at the end.\nMe versus Unbound.\nUnbound takes place in Emporia, Kansas,\nMidwest America. Famous for its epic\ndistance, unforgiving terrain, searing\nheat, and full gas racing, which\ncombined together make this the toughest\nand most iconic gravel race in the\nworld. And in a few days time, I'm going\nto be going elbow to elbow with some of\nthe world's best for the 200mile Pro\nRace. Well, this year, we've got more\ninternational competition than ever.\nThe route of Unbound. Well, 200 miles.\nI'm not sure how you sum that up in an\neasy way. We have them screaming up\nfront. It is now single file. They are\npinned. There's a lot of different\nsections to approach. Some are famous\nfor being really fast. Some are famous\nfor people notoriously having punctures\nnon-stop and some are just famous for\nbeing real tough, gritty sections.\nThe anticipation of today has been so\nintense. You just know that in the back\nof your mind, if it seems like it's all\nplain sailing for now, at that moment in\ntime, at some point it's going to get\ntough.\nSo, my goal coming to Unbound, I laid\nthis out on the line real early on, and\nthat was to come here to race for the\npros and push for a top 20. I would say\nthat even if right now you had 10hour\npower of 4 watts per kilo and you had an\nFTP of 5 1/2 watts per kilo, which I\nthink those are probably around the\nnumbers that you're looking at. Breaking\ninto the top 20 would be difficult.\nIt's been a big journey and progression\nall the way through ramping up my\ntraining, looking at the different\nelements of the bike, the terrain, all\nthe training that's led up to this. This\nis the final the final push. So, he's\ngoing into it with the best prep that he\ncould have done. And I think it's\nchallenged me both mentally and\nphysically\nmore than I was anticipating. Unbound is\nusually extremely hot and that will\nwreak havoc on your power late into the\nrace. That is kind of the critical\nmoment where people either completely\ncrack and fall back to, you know, 80th\nplace, 100th place, or break into that\ntop 20 or top 10.\nNow, in a few days time, I am going to\nbe going elbow to elbow with some of the\nworld's best in the 200mile pro men's\nrace. But Unbound isn't just for pro\nriders because shortly after the pro men\nand women set off, you've got the age\ngroupers who set off in hot pursuit.\nNow, before I get too excited about my\nrace, well, I'm missing two very\nimportant things. My bike and race\nnumber.\nIt should come as no surprise to hear\nthat I've gone all out on the bike front\nand as such I've got myself a very\nspecial setup to race on. And at the\nheart of it all is Shimano's GRX 12speed\nDi2 levers and rear derailia\ncomplemented with some Dura Ace road\ncomponents to help optimize my bike for\nthe crazy high speeds of the Pro Race.\nAs such, the gearing on this bike is\nsomething that people would be more\nfamiliar with on a road bike. 1134 to\nDura Ace cassette and then up front we\nhave a 3450 to Dura Ace power meter\nchain set. one that I most certainly did\nnot just have lying around spare. No,\nreally, because this, all of the other\ncomponents on this bike, and the Jura\nAC50 wheels are supplied courtesy of\nShimano, who are sponsoring this video,\nand it's thanks to their help that I'm\nout here in Emporia, able to take part\nin Unbound. In terms of some of the\nother details on this bike, well, my\nchain is waxed with Silka's Endurance\nchip wax. I've got my trusty Selarco 3D\nprinted saddle to peique carbon bottle\ncages. I've got my Wahoo Rome 3 up\nfront. I've got my Insta 360 action cam.\nAll my spares are packed deep inside of\nthe frame. I've got 50 mil Pirelli\nCurrato Gravel H tires. And then in\nterms of the frame and fork, well, if\nyou'd like to know more details about\nthat, well, I'm afraid I can't tell you\ncuz currently it's top secret. So, when\nthe time is right, we will have a video\ntelling you all of the things that you\nneed to know about it. So, subscribe to\nGCN and GCN Tech and turn on your\nnotifications because I'll also tell you\nthe story behind this incredible\ncustom paint job that I've got. Also,\nhave have you noticed uh got Alex\nwritten on it here, here, and up front\non the forks.\nTell me that's not blue and cool.\nI've gone all out on my setup and as\nsuch, Rule 28 have given me the fastest\ngravel race suit they make in a custom\nGCN design. In fact, it's one of the\nonly times you'll ever see me not in the\nfamous GCN red.\n[Applause]\nHi. Hi, Kai.\nHello. You okay? Yeah, good. Just\ndriving down to the start. Good. I think\nI'm all ready to race. I think I think\nit's all good to go. Yeah, I'm starting\nto feel I feel like uh I'm starting to\nfeel a little bit nervous now, but not\ntoo bad.\njust like the anticipation of it and\nthen once you get going it'll be good.\nYeah, I think so. It seems pretty mild\nto think like going to start a 200 mile\nbike race. Yeah.\nUm it's like when we were at Big Sugar\nand then it's that like anticipation and\nthen when you get there it's all like\neven though it's like pitch black like\nlots of activity and stuff going on.\nIt's quite cool. Yeah. I'm pretty\nbuzzing for it. So yeah, main thing is I\njust hope it all goes like smoothly\nreally. Okay. Yeah. Well, good luck and\nyeah, I hope it all goes well and um\nyeah, let's speak to you at the end.\nRight. Good luck. Stay safe. Right. Love\nyou lots. Bye. Love you too. Bye bye.\nIt's getting real now. And it looks like\npeople are starting to line up. So we\nneed to push forward to the front.\nRight. See you on the grip.\nare starting to kick in now. It's all\nstarting to feel pretty real.\nOh boy, what a start. We survived that.\nPerfect race section.\nThis is wild.\nI can't believe I'm doing this. The\ntanks are going. I'm following\nIs this mental?\nHow am I going to pay for it later on?\nThe way that the start panned out, like\nevery bike race is absolute carnage.\nBikes, bodies, people everywhere. In my\nhead, what I was thinking was, it's\ngoing to be incredible to make it to the\nfront of the bike race. Even if I wasn't\ngoing to stay there for long, that was\nmy goal was to get involved, be in the\nmix, and it went to plan. Okay, the\nadrenaline is starting to wear up now.\nIt's starting to get tough.\nBut I can see the front of the race.\nThe route for this year heads north and\nis known for being slightly hillier and\ntougher than the south, but thankfully\nless muddy should it rain. From Emporia,\nwe travel north for 70 mi to the first\ncheckpoint in Alma, the most northerly\npoint of the route. The second half\nwiggles its way south where you have\ncheckpoint two at mile 148 in Council\nGrove before heading east for the last\n50 mi back into Emporia which luckily is\npredominantly downhill.\nThat was upwards of about 24 25 m an\nhour. And big talk was we saw a big\ngroup of roughly 15 riders separating\nvery early.\nDust, clouds flying everywhere, rocks\nflying everywhere. The sounds of being\ninside what's essentially a pelaton of\n200 riders or so is mind-blowing. Anyone\nthat has never experienced it before,\nit's like nothing you could ever\nimagine.\nI don't know how much money's worth of\nexpensive race bikes there. constantly\nagain rocks thrown into them and the\nnoise is off the charts. But it was\ngood. I'd survived. I'd dodged some\ncrashes. I'd stayed safe and then we\nsettled in. I say we settled in, but the\nfirst hour and a half, the average speed\nwas like 23, 24 miles an hour. Well, if\nthis group stays out in front, it could\nmake for some very interesting moves. It\nwas just like a pelon of riders. Attacks\nflying off left, right, and center. The\nlittle breakaway groups were formed. And\nthen the whole pelon would chase. Then\nit would happen again. And every single\ncorner I'm coming out of doing like 600\nwatts. Then you settle down. Then you're\ndoing 300 400 W sat in the wheels. Then\n600 watts again.\nEvery corner\n6 700 W. One big line is absolute war\nzone.\nAnd it did start to dawn on me once the\ninitial adrenaline worn off that I was\nlike, \"Hold on, we all seem to be riding\nabout as hard as everyone would ride for\nan hour an hour's race.\" And then I was\nlike, \"Well, we got 200 m to go.\"\nTurned through this town, turned left,\nand we went just up this little road\njust before it turned into this double\ntrack. And you knew something was coming\nbecause the pace lifted. All of a\nsudden, you went from being dusty to\ncovered in mud. You couldn't really see\nwhere you were going.\nHonestly, it was just carnage.\nAnd then the one guy who said to me,\n\"Watch out for this next bit. It's\nreally tricky.\" Crashed in front of me.\nHis\nbike's flying across in front of me,\ncartwheeling across. I slam the brakes\non cuz I'm stuck behind him. And then\none person was fast 2, three, four,\nfive, and I lost absolutely tons of\nplaces.\nThe chain's gone.\nRight, checking in. We are 2 hours in.\nAverage power 295 W. Average speed 24.9\nmiles an hour.\nThe race The race has smashed to pieces\nand I found myself a group. It's time to\nlock in. Training and preparation coming\ninto this event has been tough to say\nthe least. The sacrifices that I've made\nto try and do the training have been\nnothing crazy, but enough that gradually\nover time start to chip away at you. But\nI've not been in this journey alone.\nI've had the support of the GCN\ncommunity, the support of everyone in\nthe GCN office, but most importantly of\nall, I've had the support from Chloe, my\nwife, who\nwhilst I'm the person racing the event\nand it's an individual thing for me,\nshe's been pretty much by my side for\nthe entire way through this. I think\nAlex will cope really well with the\nrace. He's done all of the training and\nprep. like he's worked really hard for\nthe past 6 months plus. All of our spare\ntime outside of work is essentially\nconsumed by me trying to train as much\nas possible. Alex's preparation for the\nrace has been\nbusy.\nHe was setting alarms at like 4:00 in\nthe morning to go and do like an epic\nride. All of our spare time outside of\nwork is essentially consumed by me\ntrying to train as much as possible. And\nif Chloe didn't ride her bike with me, I\nthink she probably wouldn't have seen me\nvery much for the last 6 months. All the\ntraining has led up to this. This is the\nfinal the final push. So yeah, I think\nhe's going to smash it.\nI was sat there thinking, okay, so I've\ndropped back from what was the front of\nthe race. I've dropped back into the\nsort of second, third, maybe even fourth\ngroup, and this is still crazy hard. And\nI was\nI was kind of starting to struggle\nalready and we're hour and a half into\nthe race, but I sat tight and I was\nthinking at some point I'm going to need\nto back off again even though I've\nalready backed off from what was the\nfront of the race.\nAnd\nthen I don't quite want to say disaster\nstruck, but disaster struck.\nBig crash. I think I'm okay. I tried to\ngo from the right hand track dart across\nup over the ridge onto the left hand\ntrack and I just completely misjudged it\nand I wiped out hard. Let me show you my\nwar wounds.\nLeg, elbow, shoulder, hip.\nWe soldier on.\nCurrently, my mindset has turned to\nsurvival mode, but I'm sure we can get\nI'm sure we can get race mode back in a\nbit. Come on now.\nLong old day ahead.\nOh, man. Sorry.\nOkay.\nOkay. at this aid. 70 mi into the race.\nFocus strategy. Look at that. Smooth\nfrom Joan. Got another pack. He is\ntopped off, ready to go. Cam still\nlooking for his crew in the feed zone.\nWe're approaching the first feed now.\nIt's going to be quick pit stop. Check\nthem in one piece and away we go. My\nname's Chris. I'm one of the sport\nscientists at Precision. My job for the\nday is going to be crewing Alex out\nthere at the first and second\ncheckpoints, giving him all his\nnutrition, helping fix any bike issues\nhe's got, making sure he's ready to go.\nSo, he's going to be picking up some\ncaffeine gels, some PF62 bars and a few\nPF90s. We're aiming to keep it as brief\nas possible when he stops. He'll put\nboth feet down as he comes in. He'll\nhave thrown his pack on the floor, his\nempty one hopefully. He'll have ditch\nhis bottles at our feet. We'll load him\nup with a new pack straight away. Shove\ntwo new bottles in, stick some nutrition\neither in his uh jersey or shove it in\nthe hydration pack. Then we'll send him\non his way. Unless his bike needs some\nmud cleaning off it, in which case we'll\ngive it a quick quick spray and send him\noff.\nI had a massive get down. You okay\nthough? Yeah. The team from Precision\nFuel and Hydration were absolutely\nincredible. No, I'm fine, thank you.\nJust make sure my phone stays in my\npocket. They were so calm, cool, and\ncollected. I feel my eyes just really\nlike messed my like rhythm up. Bit of\nice if you want it. Do you want it down\nyour back? Front. You're okay. Good. Are\nwe loaded up? You're loaded up. You're\nready to go, mate. And before I know it,\nhydration bladder was out. Hydration\nbladder was in. Pocket stocked up, ready\nto go. And I was like, \"Cool. Um, yeah.\nHave I got everything then?\" And they\nwere like, \"It's done. What are you\nwaiting for? Go, go, go.\" Right. I think\nI'm in one piece, mate. Cheers, guys.\nThank you.\nPit stop one done. The crew are amazing\nand I'm on my way\nand I even leap frogged my little group.\nGives me a little breather. Happy days.\nMy head on and on until I blend.\nsuperstition.\nAnd then what happened over this next,\nlet's describe as the middle sector of\nthe race was\na roller coaster of emotions in terms of\nmy physical feelings and my mental\nstate. It's 10:00 a.m. and the sun has\ncome up and it's starting to get hot.\nNot too bad yet, but you can really feel\nit on your back.\nWe're in for a spicy one.\nMy car I'm riding buddies.\nHey guys.\nSo things started out great. We were\nmoving along at a nice pace. The group\nwe were with were working well. Everyone\nwas doing their turns. We didn't ride\ncrazy hard on the climbs. We rode at a\ngood tempo. And I think everyone knew\nthat we there was this sort of unspoken\nagreement that we're in this together.\nEveryone knows a long way to go. So,\nlet's keep a lid on it.\nOkay, we're over over halfway now. 102\nmiles in.\n5 hours 4 minutes.\nIt's going to be touch and go. We got\nunder 10 hours at this rate,\nbut I'm going to give it everything I\ngot.\nThe group had grown in size and we were\nabsolutely trucking along. We got caught\nby I think it was a group of three to\nfour riders\ncaught us from behind and these were\nessentially people that were really out\nof position within the race because they\nhad problems early on. That extra\nimpetus into our group all of a sudden\nfelt like someone had absolutely ramped\nup the speed.\nLeap of faith. We can do what we feel.\nStarting to struggle now. Really feeling\nit in the legs.\n30 something miles to the feed zone. Oh,\ncar.\nI'm getting dropped from my group.\nAh, and there goes the group. It's\nhappened.\nThe legs have gone.\n140 miles. We got 8 miles to get to the\nfeed,\npick up morale, extra food, and then I'm\ngoing to have to hang it out for another\n50 to the finish. So with the first part\nof the race being so crazy fast, you\nessentially forgot that you had the\nsmall chain ring. And it was only when I\napproached this mid phase of the race,\nhaving felt like I would been feeling\ngood and then feeling bad. And it was\nreally in those bad patches that I found\nmyself quickly and quite regularly\nreaching for the smaller chain ring to\ntry and look after my legs as best as\npossible, knowing that there's still a\nhell of a long way to go through this\nrace. One of the most frustrating things\nI could possibly think of has happened\nis I've been dropped from a group of 10\nriders and the route pretty much turned\nright and went in a straight line for\nabout 10 miles into a block headwind.\nMore headwind. Look at that\nnon-stop headwind. Ah, I'd gone from\nfeeling good to feeling bad to feeling\ngood. And then I was feeling bad again.\nAnd as we approached the second\ncheckpoint, which was at mile 147,\nI graveled into that checkpoint to be\nhonest.\nNo. Come on.\nYou're too late cuz you're hungry.\nGet that bladder in now. Get this on\nyour back.\nGoing for a bit of a bad patch, but\nyeah, this will cool you down, mate.\nYeah. Yonder.\nThank you. Thank you.\nIt's going to be cold. Yeah, it's good.\nThat's what you need at the moment.\nCooled off. Oh, look. Made my head. You\ngo. Oh, it's cold. Woo! Oh boy. Oh,\nit down the back there. Won't take long\nto melt. What way is it?\nNo, I'm good. Don't worry. I think we\ngot it. Come on.\nCheckpoint one done. Checkpoint two\ndone. I'm stocked up. I'm refueled. And\nthis is gonna take me all the way\nthrough to the finish.\nThis time is blazing down on us now.\nIt's uh it's tough.\nSo, in terms of my setup, this is\nsomething I obviously thought long and\nhard about coming into Unbound as a\ntotally self-confessed bike nerd. And I\nfeel like I got the choices right and I\nfeel happy with what I decided to use.\nOne of the things that I was thinking\nabout a lot before the race was what\nwheel set I would use. So I decided to\nchoose the Durace road wheel with a sort\nof nod more towards aerodynamics rather\nthan trying to use a wheel which was say\nmore optimized for wider tires. I\nprioritized aerodynamics over wider tire\nand wheel combinations. Basically,\nI got to sort of be honest here to\nmyself. Top 20, it's gone out the\nwindow. Unbound has beaten me when it\ncomes to a top 20. Top 30 out the\nwindow. Top 50, whilst I didn't know it,\nbut it was probably out the window. And\nI went from thinking\ninstead of trying to\naim for a position, I was like, I need\nto just do the best that I can do. I\nthought, let's try and get under 10\nhours for this thing. That's 200 m, 20\nmph average. That in itself is like off\nthe charts. That's an achievement that I\nthink I could still be proud of. So\nthat's what I aimed for.\nIf I want to stand any chance of\ncracking sub 10 hours,\nit's going to be touch and go. I think\nI'm going to have a tailwind for the\nlast bit. So,\nwish me luck. It's now turned into a\npersonal battle. Me versus Unbound.\nGot 20.6 miles to go. And if I want to\ngo under 10 hours, got exactly one hour\nto do it in.\nHead down. Let's go.\nTell you what, this has been\na roller coaster of emotions, highs,\nlows,\ncrashes, near-death experiences,\nand the end is in sight.\nNearly.\nI got to keep my game face on. No silly\nmistakes.\nIt's hurting so bad now.\nThink we can do it.\nLooks crossing the line there. Red Smith\nand Donald Madness.\nThat's the toughest thing I've ever\ndone. Yeah.\nGood. You've earned it then. That's\nenough to be suffering. Well done. That\nwas an epic epic day.\nReally well done. I think Unbound has\nbroken me. Yeah.\nYeah. Well, I finished,\nbut I feel like I've gone to battle.\nStay in my leg.\nDon't socks are coming white again.\nWell done. It's mindblowing to think\nthat people are out there not only\ncheering everybody on, but they've gone,\n\"We want to cheer for you.\" And it the\nnumber of people that I've seen around\nUnbound that shared their stories of how\nmuch they had enjoyed seeing the journey\nof my like progress through building to\nUnbound. It was like really humbling and\nI don't know, it's just a it's like a\nspecial feeling. And I think when you\ncombine all of that together and you\ncome through the finish line, you're\ntired, you're exhausted, and you think\nthat's it. It's done. And I just\nyou just lost words at the finish to be\nHaving crossed the finish line, knowing\nmy own time, my next thought was, how\nfast did the leaders go? In my head, I\nwas thinking I could be 45 minutes or so\nbehind first place based on last year's\nwinnings times. However, what I hadn't\nplanned for was for this to be another\nfastest Unbound ever. In the women's pro\nrace, Karolina Minion won in 10 hours 3\nminutes 54 seconds. Cameron Jones won\nthe pro men's race in 8 hours 37 minutes\nand 9 seconds, meaning I was 1 hour 16\nminutes behind the leader. What was my\nfirst reaction? Holy, that's fast. The\nstats for my performance though are\nstill pretty impressive. I did 200 miles\nwith an average speed of 20.3 mph, an\naverage power of 234 watt, a normalized\npower of 274 watt, average heart rate\n137 with a perceived effort, well,\nwithout a doubt, 10 out of 10. I also\ndropped my pal Dylan Johnson a message\nto let him know he was right all those\nmonths ago about a top 20 being out of\nreach for me. But you know what? I'm\ntotally cool with that. And while my\nbody might be beaten up and not working\nas well as it could, my bike setup\ndidn't skip a beat. No punctures, no\nmechanicals, and no issues to overcome.\nJust a boss setup that was an absolute\npleasure to ride. Well, there you go. I\ncan't believe I'm about to say this, but\nthat's Unbound 200 2025 done and dusted.\nIt's been an absolutely incredible\njourney to go right from the start\nthrough to the end. And to wrap this up\nin one video is an incredibly like\namazing experience, and one that I'm\nalways going to remember. I hope\neveryone at home has enjoyed it as well.\nBut what I do want to say is a massive\nthanks to everyone that has helped me\nthrough this because without you guys,\nit wouldn't be possible. Oh, like\nfirstly, thanks to the people that have\nhelped support this video and made it\npossible. Thanks to everyone at home\nthat has supported me on the way. And I\nguess more importantly than anyone else,\nI want to say thanks to Chloe, my wife,\nfor putting up with me all the way\nthrough this because without her\nsupport, I honestly don't think I could\nhave done it. So, there you go. Unbound\n2025 done and dusted. If you have\nenjoyed this video, please do give it a\nbig thumbs up. And um I'd really\nappreciate hearing your thoughts in the\ncomments section down below and I'll\nenjoy sitting and reading through those.\nRight, see you later. Just to confirm\nUnbound, I don't think I'm ever doing it\nagain.\n350 next year. There's no there's not\nenough money in the world for me to do\nthe 350.\nHonestly, there's not.\nYeah, mine burns.\nWe all agreed to have a little mini pit\nstop.
