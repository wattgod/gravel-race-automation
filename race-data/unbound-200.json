Weather determines who finishes, not just fitness.",
      "consequences": [
        "Mud years: Carry a paint stick, accept 20+ minute mud walks",

      "expectation_reset": "Run 40-45mm tubeless tires with robust casings. Carry 2-3 spare tubes, plugs, pump. Train in heat and humidity. Have a mud plan (paint stick, grass cleaning). Pace by heart rate, not power—your numbers will drop in heat. Accept that something WILL go wrong—flats, mechanicals, bonking. Mental resilience wins here."
