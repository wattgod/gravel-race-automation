        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Life Time knows how to run events. GPS tracking via Trackleaders, clear rules, well-communicated course. The self-supported format means they provide less, but what they provide is professional."

        "score": 5,

        "score": 5,

        "score": 3,

      "adventure": {
        "score": 5,

Just you, 350 miles of tire-shredding limestone, and whatever you can carry or buy at gas stations in the middle of nowhere Kansas. You'll ride through the night without sleep, make decisions while hallucinating from exhaustion, and discover exactly what kind of person you are when everything hurts and nobody is coming to save you. Less than half of first-time starters finish. The course record is under 18 hours - most mortals need 25-35. If you're not prepared to suffer alone in the dark, questioning every life choice that led you here, this race will break you. That's the point.",
