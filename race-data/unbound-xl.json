          "description": "Unbound XL is a gravel bike race over 350 miles, 563 kilometers, in the farm lands of Emporia Kansas. This bike race is fully self supported event, meaning EVERYTHING you eat, wear, or repair is all on you. \n\n98% of the course is gravel roads, you ride through the night, meaning you need lights. There are 6 gas stations along the route where you can get food and water.\n\nI learned A TON from this experience, and will change a lot of my personal set up for next year. Below is my set up in detail and what I would change. \n\nMy setup was a SURVIVAL approach vs RACE, which I feel now was a bad idea. I was so confident I could win or podium, that I didn’t want bad mechanical luck take me out. \n\nSo I leaned on my fitness to over come weight, but it was just too heavy and I could have streamlined the setup much more. But I just didn’t know what to expect. \n\nBODY: \nHydro pack w/storage \n- chain\n- Tire\n- Jacket\n- tubes\n- tools\n- flow hydration (calorie mix)\n- ketones \n- 3L of water w/ketones \n- head lamp\nCargo bibs for xtra storage \nMTB shoes & pedals \n\nBIKE\nFrame bag (all batteries for lights, GoPros, and battery bank)\nTop tube bag (2 GoPros)\nSaddle bag (C02 + levers)\nAero bars \nFront fork (30mm) \n42 IRC doublecross tires \nCadex 35 AR wheels \n\nFANNY PACK\n2,000 calories\n\n0:00 Intro\n1:01 Act 1- Setting the scene\n5:14 Act 2- Everything goes wrong\n14:36 Act 3- Just like that, things got better\n23:18 Act 4- All is fair in love & bike racing\n31:50 Act 5- I love this shit\n41:55 Ending talk\n\n\nSTRAVA ////\nhttps://www.strava.com/activities/7256701985/\n\n\n----------------\nBest Way to Support a bro\n\n////// www.join.Whoop.com/vc\nGet 15% off a Whoop Subscription, Track your fitness and balance that busy life of yours. \n\n////// www.almsther.com/veganbag\nGet a SICK bar bag bro!

          "transcript": "i i've never\ndnf'd and i'm not about to start now\n[Music]\nnot good\nthe darker things get\nthe brighter the light when it shines\ni'm a poet that's so stupid dude i'm so\nstupid this is so dumb\nuh\nwow\nthat was the most fun i've ever had on a\nbike ever\ngood how do i wash off bro\nhow do i wash off\nemporia kansas is a small town\nof about 20 000 people\nit sort of takes you back to a more\nsimpler time a quiet time\nbut once a year in june the cycling\ncommunity descends on emporia kansas\nthe people that come here are from all\nwalks of life and all skill sets riding\nall sorts of bikes to take on one of the\nmost prestigious gravel races in america\nnow you have a few different routes to\nchoose from\nthe smallest route is 25 miles this is\nwhat they call their junior route then\nyou have a 50 mile route still pretty\nbig especially on this gravel then you\nhave the 100 mile route most would call\nthis the biggest one but here in unbound\n200 is available if that's not enough\nyou literally have a 350\nmile ride that's the one i'm doing\nbecause i'm a crazy person\nnow the 200 though is the most\nprestigious this is where you get the\nbiggest hitters the pro athletes\nliterally winning unbound can make your\ncareer as a cyclist so this is the\nspiciest the hardest the fastest uh the\none thing about the 200 is you have two\ndesignated rest stops where you have a\nsag crew uh that have a little tent they\ncan give you food and water and repair\nequipment like you have two points on\nthe course where you can stop but this\nrace is spicy i mean this i've done it\ntwice before haven't had really great\nluck so i wanted to try something new i\nwanted to have a new adventure on my\nhands\nnow the xl is a much more relaxed pace i\nmean we're still going fast we're still\ngoing hard but at 350 miles it's not\nvery spicy but here's the main thing\nit's fully self-supported so when you\nstop to get food and water that's on\nyour own dime you've got to stop at\nlittle grocery stores little markets you\ngot to kind of plan that along the way\nand so\nfinding out what kind of food you need\nwhat kind of water you need it's\nimportant but the most important part is\nthe gear the equipment setup because\nagain this is fully self-supported you\nhave no sag crew whatsoever so what you\nbring on you can make or break you my\nbike of choice is the canyon grizzle\nwith the suspension fork i'm running the\nkdx 35 ars with the 42 double cross irc\ntires filled with orange seal i love\nthis bike it i did it with west texas\ni've been training on this thing i've\ngot a really solid lighting setup got\nthe aero bars three bottle cages from\nrundle i've got the almost their packs i\nwon by explorer group set this bike eats\ngood morning okay it's not morning at\nall it's noon and i love it\ni can't\nreally describe how weird this feels\nit's so peaceful there's like birds\nchirping outside it's just a lovely day\neveryone else is because the 200s\ntomorrow everyone's just chilling\nbut it's like the race is about to start\nuh and it's so weird because it's like\nin\nthree hours\njust under three hours\nand so then what do you want you want to\nwake up to\neverything being perfect\nnot perfect not great\neveryone has all these different things\nthat they're gonna have to manage\nand it could be just not feeling totally\ngreat feeling just a little off\nallergies\nyour bike's not working\nyour bag is not working your lights not\nworking things happen\nthere's just so many of these things\nthat you're going to have to manage and\nit's really who can\nuh not succumb to\nthe snowball effect of all the things\ngoing wrong\nand over 350 miles\nthere's so many opportunities for things\nto go wrong\n[Applause]\noh no\ni'm usually never prepared for anything\ni do ever that's just my jam\ni just figure it out on the go can't do\nthat with this kind of event and so i\nhad a fanny pack that i had counted out\nevery single calorie that i was going to\nneed for the entire 350 miles did the\nwhole like timing\nwhat i was gonna eat i had all my money\nand somehow\nno matter how important this fanny pack\nwas and how much i\nput my energy into this and counted the\ncalories\ni get to the start line and it's not on\nme\nand i'm it's like a bad it's a good\nnightmare i'm feeling around on my waist\ngoing where's my fanny pack\ni have no money and no food\nwhat am i doing\ni am so on brand\num somehow\nleft my fanny pack\nat home\nor in the car some dude's not on me\nthat is\nso vital that has all my food and all my\nmoney\ni don't understand i don't understand\nhow i can do this to myself\nokay now bear with me here for just a\nlittle bit because this first part um\noh boy very difficult and i need to try\nto convey to you the emotions\nthe rollercoaster of emotions and\nfrustration that i was feeling going\ninto a race that i had prepared so hard\nfor was so confident that i could win\neverything\nwas just lining up\nme right i mean coming up vc\nand so the fact that i woke up sick\nwhich was just the most frustrating\nthing i haven't been sick in years it's\njust like\nwhat's a nightmare scenario waking up\nfor a 350 mile race that you've put all\nyour energy into and you wake up sick\nokay great\nthat's a hurdle i'm gonna try to have to\novercome and then you line up on the\nline and you realize that you're\nthe most dumbest human on the face of\nthe planet and you forgot the most vital\npart of your kit yeah dude i've got\nthree gopros i've got 10 batteries i've\ngot a spare tire i've got a spare chain\ni have a chain braking tool\ni've got everything to build a whole new\nfreaking bike but bro i don't have food\nand i don't have money\njust getting out of bed this morning was\none of the more difficult things i've\never done\nbut what am i supposed to do the\nfinancial swing between not doing this\nand how much hype i put into this\ni look i i mean it is what it is\nif you come into a situation and you\ndon't like your situation\nwait a minute\nand it will change\ni promise you it will\nand so on a 350 mile race i'm not going\nto quit yet\nso much can change so much can happen\nyeah\nthere you go\nwhat a legend\nall right we are an hour and 20 in\nuh we've been going through these gates\nuh there is two guys up the road they\nlike went early\nso\nthere's that uh\nprobably about 30 guys with us 30 men\nand women\neveryone together\nuh the heart rate is just\nthrough the roof i'm actually really\nworried about it i don't understand why\nit's like 180 and i just don't\nunderstand why it's like that\nanyways we're riding it's fun\nnow this group that this race is very\ncommunity based everyone sort of feels\nlike they're in this together\nuh and so i actually had\na wonderful human offer me 40 bucks he\nsaid i have a bunch of cards i you know\ni've got a ton of cash i came really\nprepared unlike you uh and so here's 40\nbucks\nso i i was given forty dollars from\nanother racer in the pack\nwhich\nis the only reason i was really able to\nconsider continuing\nyou know and so i'm battling this like\nwell i don't have my food but not okay\nnow i have some money and you know but\ncrap i'm i feel sick you know should i\njust turn around i mean look you know\nhow\nhow much energy it's gonna take to do a\n350 mile bike ride i just did this in\nwest texas so i know what it's going to\ntake i know that you need to be at your\nabsolute best and everything working\nperfect to even just consider finishing\nlet alone that my goal was to win\nlet's just hold on as long as we can\nand let's just see\nif anything's gonna change\ni wish\nthings i don't believe\nwell i'm gonna guess\nthis is the wrong way this is the wrong\nroute\neven though i\ndouble triple quadruple check this was\nthe updated route\nuh this does not look like it\nlooks like we are going the wrong way\nso we roll into the first uh gas station\nreally the first place you can stop\nalong the way\ni'm\nwildly out of contention i think at this\npoint i'm around\n20th 25th\ni've been riding for about three and a\nhalf hours\ni took a wrong turn\nyou know i don't have my food i'm just\nboy\nthe frustration is is building now at\nthis gas station\ni i was running through all the\ndifferent scenarios and how i could stop\ndoing this\nlike what was going on inside my body\nand my mind\nwas just stop\nof course dude everything just go wrong\nplease\nbut one major thing i've learned during\nall these\nreally\nhard efforts\nis to just\nwhatever is in your mind\nlet it be okay you can have the negative\nthoughts you can have the negative\nfeelings but just don't let your body\nstop\njust keep going as if everything is fine\nlet the body\nlead the mind\nand that's what i did\nyes\nnegative thought after negative thought\nafter negative thought\nflooded my brain\ni had to just overcome this urge to quit\nwith the promise to just keep moving\nwe're headed into the night\ni wanted to quit so\nbad at that first rest stop\nbecause i'm not in contention\nat all\ni'm wildly frustrated\ni mean you control what you can control\nman and like my prep for this and every\ni was so confident\nwhat am i supposed to do just not\njust give up\ni don't give up dude\nwhatever i'm\nwe're gonna finish because that's what i\ndo\ni i've never dnf'd\nand i'm not about to start now\nyou okay\nuh i don't really understand why i'm\nfeeling so much better right now\nbut uh\nwe're feeling better\nso we're just kind of rolling along my\nheart rate is totally different now\nwe're 104 miles in\nalmost the second gas station\ni don't know dude\nthe mental gymnastics that i've been\ngoing through for the past eight hours\nis absolute world-class i mean the\nconversations that i'm having with\nmyself and the arguments that i'm having\nthey're impressive really now i don't\nhave my food but i did have some flow\nwith me like some extra flow products so\ni've been dumping that in my bottles\nreally trying to keep up as many\ncalories as possible even though i'm not\nreally that hungry been dumping a ton of\nketones into me about 30 grams every two\nto three hours\nuh and look i'm in night owl so i know\nthings are going to get better i just\nhave to keep moving i can't stay still\nthis one's hard\nthis one's really hard\nhonestly\njust staying in bed all day was gonna be\nhard\njust existing today was gonna be hard\nlet alone doing 350 miles i said this\nquote on instagram a while back\nthe deeper into the cave you go\nmakes the light so much brighter when\nyou exit\ni think i said it in a cooler way\nbut like\ni'm a poet\nnow what was really cool about the\nknight is that you could see a tail\nlight really far up the road so then you\nwould put an effort you'd catch that\nperson then you'd go a little faster\nyou'd see a new tail light new carrot\nand you'd catch that person so i was\njust sort of leapfrogging my way through\nthe night\nuh-oh\noh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] dude you okay\nyeah he's gonna be all right\nokay do you need anything\nambulance we you have an ambulance\num i don't man i'm sorry about that i'll\npack one next time\nnow the night time was a little sketchy\nso you had to be careful you know we did\ncome across those guys that had crashed\nbut the group we were in actually was\ngetting a little spicy we're moving\nthrough the pack we're feeling really\ngood now\nbut then i rode away from my group i was\nall alone and the delirium fully set in\ni saw the sign\nit opened up my mind i saw the sign\noh\noh do you have the time\nto listen to me one\nabout everything and nothing all at once\nhello darkness my old friend\nsomething something see you again\nthat's so stupid dude i'm so stupid this\nis so dumb\nuh peanuts\nregular nuts\ndo you have like regular peanuts\nanywhere\n12 hours in 180 miles and i'm finally\ngetting the pep in my step back now i'm\nready to race and i've been leap\nfrogging\nyou know throughout the whole night i've\nbeen pushing my way through the pack i\nthink now we're breaking top 20 and\nthese two guys i was able to convince to\nwait just give me like a minute right\nbecause when i came to this gas station\nthey had been sitting there for a little\nwhile and they were about to go and i\nsaid hey i'll pull\nall through the night if you just wait\nfor me give me one minute\nand they said okay and we were off ready\nto just absolutely send it alrighty i uh\ncaught these two wonderful gentlemen at\nthis\ngas station and convinced them to wait\nand trade for some pulls so we're doing\nthat it's a little past three\num\nand uh\nyeah the body is\ntotally responding way better now\nso that's a little frustrating but it's\nall good because we're we're rolling now\nand that's fun\nnight riding is my all-time favorite\nthing if you have not done it you should\nabsolutely try it there's something very\nmagical about night riding\nand\na connection that you have with the\nworld especially when you come into\nsunrise riding into the sunrise is just\na very special thing to do on a bicycle\nnow\nyes am i frustrated that all of a sudden\nkinda i'm feeling way better and i feel\nlike i'm i'm racing at the front we've\nalready we're over 200 miles into this\nrace and i'm drilling it i'm feeling\nbetter than i ever have\nyeah that's okay but like it's better\nnow than ever right\nand so let's just leapfrog let's find as\nmany people let's let's catch as many\npeople as possible\none of the craziest experiences of this\nride is how deep of a connection you\nmake with random strangers for such a\nshort period of time you've never seen\nthem in your life before all of a sudden\nyou ride together for three and a half\nhours through the night in this crazy\nrace and you would just\ndie for them you would go to war for\nthem and then all of a sudden\nyou'd never see him again it's wild\nregular peanuts\ndude we were hauling the mail for the\nlast little bit\nour tribe of three became a tribe of\nfive as we came across two other guys at\nthis gas station now they looked a\nlittle bit wrecked uh but they got\npretty motivated once we came because\nnow we've got a group of five to just\nrotate\nnow i have had zero mechanicals this was\nthe first time i even had to pull out a\ntool my cleat started coming off i was\nable to fix that pretty easily no big\ndeal but now we are ready to roll\nwe have a solid group and now with these\ntwo these two guys\nwe should be able to roll for sure\nastronomer\ndo you want some lube\nhe's a uh amateur astronomer\nhe was telling us space stuff\nhe was in the military and had to learn\nhow to uh navigate by the stars\nthat's badass huh\nso hard to eat peanuts while riding with\none hand on gravel\nyou've been a legend man i really\nappreciate you\nno problem\ni nestled into my new family here for\nthe next 70 miles\nmy confidence all-time high we are going\nto finish and we might actually\ncrack off a good result\nso our band of brothers riding strong\nthe community the vibe the connection\nbetween these guys unbelievable\nwe have been absolutely sending it\ntrying to catch anyone in front of us\nnow this guy though\nhas just been sitting on the back the\nentire time acting like he's hurting and\nthat's fine if you don't feel good you\ncan hang on the back but\ni got my eye on you now we do catch one\nmore we catch anton who's like an ultra\ndistance uh runner crazy successful\nrunner\nso we roll into the second to last rest\ngroup feeling great i mean i'm like bro\ni think we could probably catch another\ntwo three people if we can keep this\ncamaraderie going but also\ni don't really want to come to the line\nand sprint with these guys because the\ndifference here is like five positions\nright\nso we roll into this gas station um\nto me i still feel a real brotherly bond\nwith everyone so i'm not going to try to\ndo anything weird here\nwhat are you supposed to do\nis that guy attacking us\nokay\nbut so the guy who has not taken a\nsingle pull for like\n20 miles 30 miles acting like he's all\nhurting him and anton freaking attack us\nat the rest station dude\nit's on\n98 miles to go\nand i just peed off the bike\npeed all over my leg\nso we're winning\nwe're winning the p on your leg contest\nnow this betrayal cut deep\njeffrey and anton the two that attacked\nus they're both from colorado so they're\nlike colorado bros so now the three of\nus or four of us including me\nis andrew from great britain we've got\nscotty from arizona and then federico\nfrom italy so we have just this\nworld-class team right now and we are\nchasing these two colorado bros because\ni\ni'm hurt i've been cut to my soul\non the betrayal that they had on us\nso sure i didn't start super great but i\nam finishing on top of the world i'm\nfeeling better than i have ever felt on\nthe bike which is crazy because i've i\nhave 260 miles in my legs\nand this is what's kind of crazy to\nexplain to someone who's never done\nsomething like this is you would just\nassume well there's no way i could even\nride\nuh without sleep i could not do a\nhundred miles even if i had all the\nsleep you just sort of put yourself in a\nsituation where you assume what what it\nwould be like for you\nit's totally different\nthan what you could ever imagine when\nyou go through this arcadian rhythm of\nnightfall and then sunrise\nyour body just\nadapts it just everything changes and\nyou honestly like right now it feels\nlike i'm riding the first\n60 miles of a ride like i've just\nstarted\nwhat we have gone through\ndoesn't even exist like it does my legs\naren't fatigued i'm not tired i'm not\nhungry\nand i've burned through so many calories\ni've eaten at this point something like\n13 000 calories\nit's just so hard to explain unless\nyou've done it now\nwe finally wrap them to\nthe original course or the main course\nso this is like the 100 mile and the 200\nmile course and we actually see people\nso we're\nwhat do you guys do in the 50\n100 okay so we're\nwe've connected with the hundred\nand uh it's\nthe morale boost because we've just been\nalone for 300 miles\nso the moral morale here the moral\nsupport oh i can't talk i'm brain dead\nuh it's very awesome to see other humans\nthe good stuff\nnow our team of of worldwide athletes\nhere just been crushing\nand look i'm pretty sour about this\nbetrayal but now\ni think i have to betray\nmy team so i can make sure that the\nbetrayal of our team does not just ride\naway into the sunset\nwe get into this little downhill section\nand and look i need to go i'm ready to\nfly and since i have suspension on my\nbike i just let this thing absolutely\non this little small descent and i know\nit doesn't look like much\nbut when it's wet and it's you're tired\nand yada yada yada\ni was able to just go no breaks down\nthis thing and actually create a little\ngap now\ndo i feel bad do i feel bad that i\nattacked this group that we've been\nworking so well together yes i do but\nit's a race and i feel worse about\ngetting attacked than i do about\nattacking\ni gotta catch i gotta catch these\ncolorado bros\nthe love\nwhile i'm riding through the 100 and 200\nwas just amazing now andrew from great\nbritain he actually makes the bridge and\ncatches back up after i attacked so uh\nour italian bro and our arizona bro they\nare now gone we hit i think\nheart attack hill or leg break hill and\nour boy from great britain he's only got\ntwo gears so he starts running\nand i'm powering through and\ni just feel look this sounds douchey i\nfeel invincible right now flying up this\nsteep hill\ni love those socks\nstill giving love the entire way because\nthe love that i'm receiving i want to\nshare but then we see him\nwell well well\nisn't it mr i don't know what a pool is\nbro tried to act like there was what are\nyou talking about man what do you mean\ni'm just riding my bike it's like dude\nyou've been on the back dangling acting\nlike you're hurting for so long but so\nnow it's me and this guy uh\nbecause anton actually got dropped\ngreat britain guy is still chasing but\nwe are\nfull on race mode and now this guy's\nlike kind of playing some games he's\nkind of riding a little soft great\nbritain guy catches back on dude's only\ngot two gears but they're his big gears\nand this is a flat course so\nlike those are definitely the gears to\nhave\nand so now we kind of have this\nthis team\nwhere we were together through the night\nbut now we attack the other guys anyways\nwe start rolling into\nthe final rest stop of the race\nwe only have something like\n40 miles left to go\nso we fill up our water we get some\ncalories and then it gets really awkward\nbecause\nthe saboteurs\nare now catching the sabotagers\nright now i gotta look at anton in the\neyes and then this other guy from italy\nwho i really liked and it's like i have\nto look at him go i'm sorry bro but i'm\nharassing\nall right that was the last rest stop of\nthe day\nwe have 40 miles\nwe're at two and a half hours\ntwo and a half hours we're at 20 and a\nhalf hours jeez\nlouise\nuh it's dumping it's raining it's cold\nwe're rolling\nwe're rolling i'm tired dude i need to\ngo to sleep\nall right\nthank you\nwhat is this\ngood wild\nleft watch out\ncoming here coming\noh my goodness\nkeep going you got [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]\nyou go you got it\nuh oh\ngeez louise\nthis is crazy man\nwell\nthis is gnarly\ni mean\nthis is no joke the mud just\nthere's just no negotiating with it\nthat's for sure\ni have always heard of horror stories of\nthe kansas mud and how it can just\ntotally wreck you it's very strange\nbecause of how slippery it was but it\nalso stuck\nand so then\nbig brained it went into the grass grass\nwas like a toothbrush literally brushing\noff all the mud so then my whole drive\ntrain could work well then\nstarted riding riding through that now\nlook\ni'm very self-deprecating and a lot of\ntimes i talk about how\ni'm not very good and that's usually\nbecause comparison is a thief of joy so\nwhen i'm racing against high level pros\nthat are getting paid to race i feel\nlike a turd muffin but when i'm coming\nthrough the pack of all these guys and\nand and gals\ndude i'm feeling so elite like i'm just\nrolling along the side like everyone's\nwalking i'm riding\nand bro i'm having the time of my life\nokay this is officially epic\nofficially epic\nturtle\nthis is the most fun i've ever had on a\nbike\nso me and the original saboteur guy\njason were together so our group of six\nhas now devolved into me and him and\ni've got to beat him i mean that is like\ngoal number one right now but we're\nrolling i mean we are absolutely flying\ni cannot believe we're\n10 miles from the finish and i'm doing\nlike 300 and something watts\nwhat was so difficult though is that\nyou're trying to draft okay\nbut the water and the mud is getting\nspit up into your eyeballs and i\ncouldn't see anything now right here\ntrain was coming we sprinted to get over\nit and then the train came and it\nactually blocked anton from catching us\nokay so now\nwe're solid like we're sprinting\nit's gonna come down to a sprint for\nsure me and jason uh he kind of asked me\nto slow down a little bit but like all\ngood he was still there and then we\ncatch this guy jeffrey\nwho i had saw in the very beginning of\nthe race i catch him in like the last\nturn\nand then it comes to a full-on\nthree-way\nsprint foreign\ndude\ngood job dude i thought you were\nyou came out of there let me see it\nbut it was\nuh this was the most fun i've ever had\non a bike really yeah yeah that rain\nlike when the rain came down it was just\nprobably refreshing\nit was just technical and epic and like\nthis is\ninstagram gold\nyou know what i mean\nthe beginning of this ride was so\nmiserable\nand i felt like such a bag of dicks\ni was certain i was not gonna finish\nand then\nyou just keep pedaling\nand then time passes\nand then all of a sudden\nwe're smashing we're flying\nand there was a guy that passed me\nlike i was standing still at like mile\n60 and i caught him in the final turn\nthis was the most fun i've ever had on a\ni am absolutely shelled though\nso in closing\nthere's a philosophy called one more and\nyou can use this for anything\none more mile one more day one more\npedal one more push-up it doesn't matter\nyou can always do one more\nso you have to just give yourself the\nchance just go\none more\nwhatever that is\nand all of a sudden things will change\nthe winds will shift\nand you might end up finding yourself in\na position that you otherwise wouldn't\nhave thought you would have ever been in\nif i had not started this race where i\nprobably shouldn't have\ni would never have had this experience\ni would have been robbed of one of the\ngreatest experiences of my\nfresh and life but\nright now\nif you gave me a rock\nand it was drizzled with chocolate i\nwould be stuck\nthank you so much\nthat i get from the community is\nso outrageous\ni don't really know how to say it but\nlike no matter what is going out on out\nthere when i get\nlike maybe upset that i'm not doing what\ni kind of wanted to do\nand then and then i meet people\nlike croissant lady\nit's just amazing it's just so\nthe love is this the love here is real\nit's awesome\ni just want to say thank you to the\nwhole community\nlike the welcoming that i got at the end\nof this event was unbelievable i had\nsomeone bring me a sandwich a quesadilla\na croissant i mean i was just living\nlike a king laying here on the wall\ni really appreciate it\ni love you\nand i can't wait to come back here again\nand win this thing because 100 i'm gonna\nwin this i'm gonna win unbound xl it's\njust a given matter of time\nso anyways i hope you enjoyed i hope to\nsee you out in kansas next year\ndoing any one of the events the 25 to\n350 it doesn't matter whatever\nyou feel like is overreaching for you\nsign

          "transcript": "Neil, here we are. It is Friday of\nUnbound Week in downtown Emporia. Dude,\nit is wild. It is a party. Like, I'll be\nhonest, I thought it was big last year,\nbut this morning I was blown away by the\nsize of the group rides, the shakeout\nrides, heading out, and then the expo. I\njust finished walking and it is bigger\nthan I've ever seen. It's It's a party,\nman. Man, it is a crazy party going on.\nLots of friendly people, lots of people.\nYou went on one of the shakeout rides.\nWhat was that experience like this\nmorning? It was awesome. I mean, there\nwas probably about maybe 4 or 500 of us\nthat were out on the shakeout ride and\neverybody was just having a good time. I\ngot to talk to a guy from Columbia that\nwas here for the race and so it was\nreally cool to get to chat with him for\na little bit. Not Columbia, Missouri.\nYes, correct. Not country. Missouri.\nYes. And so, uh, we got to got to chat\nfor a little bit and got to kind of\nshare a little bit of course knowledge,\nlocal knowledge with some folks that\nwere a little bit worried about road\nconditions for tomorrow. But, uh, I'll\nbe honest, I I think we're going to have\na beautiful day. Yeah. You know, we're\nabout 20 minutes from the XL start.\nWe're going to walk down there. We're\ngoing to film and show it to you here in\nthis quick vlog. Then we're going to\ntalk about predictions for tomorrow\nafter that. So, we'll wrap up and we're\nheaded up to see the XL off.\n[Applause]\n[Music]\nYeah.\nYeah. Woo.\nOkay, Neil, we just watched the XL\ntakeoff. What was that like for you?\nDude, it's always cool to get to see I\nmean that helicopter flying overhead and\nall these folks getting ready to go out\nand do 350 mi. There's always a little\nbit of sadness, you know, inside because\nof what happened in 2023. But, uh,\nsomeday, someday, someday, I think I'll\nbe on that start line again for the XL.\nYou know, we've both been around this\nevent for a long time. I think the first\none I covered was in 2011. How crazy is\nit to see this on a Friday? Well, I\nmean, I was talking to you. I mean, you\nknow, when the first time I did this was\nthe 100 back in 2014, and the shakeout\nride again that I went on this morning\nhad more riders than the hundred did\nthat year. And just to see this many\nfolks taking off on a Friday for 355\n355ish miles. Uh, absolutely wild. So,\nit's it's definitely awesome to see. Uh,\nthe atmosphere again downtown is great.\nAnd, uh, I love that Emporia has this. I\nlove it. You know, we talked a lot about\nit. A lot of talk about being the\nweather. Lots of rain here in May. We\nwere worried that the sun wouldn't come\nout, that it wouldn't be windy. Guess\nwhat? I'm looking at the flag down the\nstreet. I'm feeling it. It's the wind is\nblowing. The sun is out. And I'll tell\nyou, this morning on Yuri's ride, we\nwent out towards the mud marathon\nsection from uh 2023 and 2015, and they\ndidn't actually do that on the route,\nbut I decided I was going to just ride\noff course a little bit, and it was\ncompletely dry. It was ridable. It was\ndry. Um, I was able to get through it\nwithout zero problems. No stopping, no\nmud collecting on the tires. U, I'm not\nsaying every road out there is going to\nbe dry, but I'm telling you what, I\nthink we're going to have some awesome\nconditions for the racers. Not just\ntonight that left with the XL, but uh,\nthe folks are going to be heading out\ntomorrow for the other distances as\nwell. Yeah, I think that's the\nprediction for me, too. Fast fast year\nfor all the worry about mud. I think\nit's going to be fast. I think there's\ngoing to be mud holes and not mud miles.\nUm, but overall going to be a great day.\nHey, you're going to see this on Friday\nnight coming out on all the gravel guru\nplatform minister of gravel. But\ntomorrow night, race day night,\ntechnically Sunday morning, Neil and I\nwill be right down here in downtown\nEmporia, midnight to 3:00 a.m., if you\ncome in after midnight, if you're a\nsupport crew listening to this rider\ncoming in after midnight, we will be\ndoing podcast style interviews from the\nfinish line and hopefully having those\nout Sunday. So, it's not like I got\nanything to do on Sunday. I can be here\ntill 3:00 a.m. on Sunday, right? Yeah.\nYou know, ministers aren't busy on\nSundays, I guess. So, we're going to be\nout all night, though. We're going to be\ncovering it. Neil's going to get some\nsleep after that before he uh has to\npreach on Sunday morning. I'm going to\ngo edit, but uh looking forward to\nhearing the stories. Always love to hear\nthose stories of the hard fought days.",

          "transcript": "[Music]\nfor you this is a nine of spring nine of\nspring who will take it to the Finish\nLine I keep coming back because I feel\nlike I've yet to execute the best I can\nor just give this course and this race\nthe best of myself the best of what I\nthink I could do\nhere I've come here twice now I've had\nsome bad luck some bad equipment luck\nout there but maybe that's just that's\npart of it and that's why I think people\nkeep coming back it is such a tough\ncourse such tough environmental\npotentials out here between the wind\nrain mud the sharp rocks I mean I keep\nsaying I want to come back to this race\nand get through it unscathed but who\nknows if that's even possible that's\nwhat's part of this event such a crazy\nrace it's so long that's what draws me\nback as well it's a long day out there\nI'm doing the 200 mile again for my\nthird time and the distance is what\nexcites me but that long out on a bike\nyou're bound to come up against problems\nand troubles whatever they may be yeah\nit's this journey of over coming those\nand trying to get to that finish line as\nquick as you\ncan success this year to me it's crazy\nit looks and feels a lot different than\nthe last two years I think I'm here\ntrying to perform the absolute best I\ncan but I'm also coming at it this year\nI think with a different mindset in\nhopes that that will\ncreate the day that I hope to have I'm\ncoming into the race this year with no\nexpectations no I need to do this it's I\nget to do this and whatever the Day\nbrings I want to be happy with the\nexperience I've had and that'll be a\nsuccess I'm not coming into tomorrow\nsaying I I need to get through this race\nunscathed so I can show what I can do\nout here again I don't know that that's\npossible you're there's going to be\nissues out there so I want to set that\nexpectation cuz the second something\nhappens then it's ruined it's like oh\nhere we go again something happened it's\nlike no it's going to happen it's fine\nI'm going to get through it and I'm\ngoing to have an amazing day out here\nfor 200 miles I just want to enjoy the\nentire day that's what success would\nlook like for\nme than you\nI'm going to get you\n4 3 2 1 it is go time our El women are\noffici all right guys we are here with\nwithin our first hour of racing of our\nElite women here in Unbound and we've\nalready seen a crash there were actually\na couple early on crashes I got caught\nup in one pretty early like only like s\nor8 miles in but that's just this racing\nright here as you get a little bit of a\nlull and something like that happens\nwhen you're not expecting it\n[Applause]\nwe are right here on course mile 63\nheaded towards checkpoint one in the\nalma all\ntogether in the history of Unbound I\ncan't ever remember a group of women\nthis big rolling into the first\ncheckpoint together you know it's cuz\nit's never happened\nglasses oh yeah thank\nyou ice ice\nthank you thank you good job\nthan leaving Alma at station one around\nmile 70 still in that big group and then\nI think as the heat came of the day it\ndefinitely started to warm up we started\nto get into some of the rollers out\nthere people kind of started just\ndwindling off the groups you'd look\naround and it had been 20 and then I\nthink it was down to 15 at one point\nLauren de cenzo got off the front and\nhad a good Gap I think she got up to\nlike a couple\nminutes um she was wearing a bright red\nKit so we could still see her like\nacross turns or through the farmlands\nand we're like okay Lauren's still there\nLauren's still there and then at one\npoint someone was finally like we need\nto reel her back like let's work\ntogether to get back up to her and we\nfinally got back up to her um so that\nthere wasn't just someone off the front\nbut um I think at that point again the\ngroup had dwindled down even more by\nthen we had Lauren de cenzo up by 50\nseconds so at one point that was up to 3\nminutes and that's down to less than a\nminute now and more importantly the\nchase women's pack can see her so you\nhave 11 women working\ntogether and have we ever got a stared\nfield here\nas we head up this hill and get ready to\nmake the turn to drop down into that\nInfamous little egyp climb so now one of\nthe best things we're seeing here today\nwe're seeing a women's\nrace now we just caught back up with the\nlead women and uh looks like we've got a\ngood group together here\nthank you guys get it there go\nbaby 52 miles in I believe and hey we're\nstill in the game Heather is in the lead\ngroup and I think she was first out of\nthe cruise station so yeah now I mean\ngame is on and I'm nervous as hell\nbecause until we get to the Finish Line\nwe're not at the Finish\nLine I made a point to like really get\nin and out of that second one as fast as\nI could um and Caroline another Canyon\nRider and I were the first two out we\ngot out of there pretty quick again big\nthanks to the canyon crew and we had a\nlittle a little bit of a gap or a bid\nbut the group that we had been with of\nlike the 10 women or so kind of crawled\nback so we were back to that group of I\nthink it was 10 then nine or 10\nso the group whittel down to nine of us\nin the final probably 35 30 miles to go\nand the whole time I'm just seeing on\nmyself is this going to be a Sprint\nfinish like that is my worst nightmare\nmy Sprint is not much faster than my\nlike Iron Man base I kind of was waiting\nthinking that people were going to\nattack and then I'm like I should attack\nor do something I don't want it to come\ndown to that and it was weird because\nlike people stopped doing work people\nwere sitting up people would pull\nthrough but then sit up and it was just\nthat cat and mouse game of cycling where\nit's like no one wants to go to the\nfront no one wants to do\nwork there I think there were just too\nmany women in the group\nthat no one was NE going to get away\nnecessarily\nall right mile 178 we've just come over\ntoola clim where Paige onwell set a\nblistering pace so no one was really\ngetting any sort of space in that final\nsection and by then we're down to 15\ndown to 10 miles to go this is a group\nwe takeing to the Finish Line what are\nwe going to have here today is Sprint\nfinished there's one final Hill Climb um\na mile out from the finish right by the\nuniversity it's in it in the course\nevery year so I knew that hill was going\nto come into play so I'm like maybe like\nif we attack there we'll drop at least\nanother couple or I don't know get over\nthat fast and spread things out but\neveryone went as hard as they could up\nthat hill and it's literally just yeah\nhalf not even a mile half mile from here\nand then you make a right corner and\nthen a laugh down into the Finish shoot\nand everyone was still kind of right\nthere and it's just this long long\nstraight stretch towards that Finish\nLine\nBanner going to be our 20 24 lifetime\nUnbound gravel\nChampion oh looks like they are around\nthe turn they are approaching the Finish\nstraight away all Riders are together\nladies and gentlemen make a little noise\nthe biggest field Sprint in about the\nbreakdown I'm going to give this to you\nLe bring it home I found for you this is\na nine of spring nine of spring who will\ntake it you look for this one it looks\nlike take\nthis I was happy just to be perfectly\nhonest not to get last of the\nnine not that it matters at that point I\nthink honestly in my mind the last 10\nmiles I'm like\nthis was already a win this day for the\nour group of women that rode together\nand to have our own race that experience\nand that bike racing Dynamic for that\nlong of a day and such a good group work\nworking together and riding together\nand yeah it was it was really really\ncool that's the first time in gravel\nRacing for me that I've been with\nwomen's a women's field racing we're\nracing each other it's not affective by\nother Dynamics like the men's race or\nthe age group race coming from behind\nlike it was just us racing each other\nand it was really cool I think it's\nstill sinking in this was the Unbound\nthat I believe deep down I could have I\njust wanted an unscathed equipment day\nwhere I could show the work I put in on\nthe bike every day all of the like 4:00\na.m. wake up calls to be on the Sho out\ngroup ride in Tucson on Saturdays like\nall the Melt lemon climbs and and\ninterval efforts and just all the work\nwhich it doesn't mean anything it\ndoesn't guarantee you anything just cuz\neveryone works hard just cuz you put the\nwork in doesn't mean you're going to get\na result but to still believe that you\ncan put that work in and a day can come\ntogether it just makes everything so\nworth it the journey every day for me is\nworth it I get to do this I get to be\nout there training hard I love it that's\nall I want to be doing but then to have\na race result or not even the result\njust the race itself come together in\nthat experience that I got to have\nyesterday was made the last 6 months and\nall the training and the the hard work\njust yeah it makes it like okay you put\nthat work in you can be up there with\nthose women you can do this fifth I mean\nit didn't even matter really I was in\nthat group I I was in that shoot with\nthose top front women and that was\nyeah that was everything and you'll be\nhearing this a lot today the elite women\nset a new course record",

          "transcript": "After 6 months of preparation, I've\nfinally made it to Unbound, the toughest\ngravel race in the world.\n[Music]\nI've done over 350 hours worth of\ntraining, and I'm here to race the pros.\nAll that stands between me and the\nfinish line is 200 miles of the most\nbrutal gravel terrain.\nBut can I actually finish it? And do I\nstand any chance of a good result? Well,\nthere's only one way to find out. Yeah.\nWell, good luck and I hope as well and\num yeah, to speak to you at the end.\nMe versus Unbound.\nUnbound takes place in Emporia, Kansas,\nMidwest America. Famous for its epic\ndistance, unforgiving terrain, searing\nheat, and full gas racing, which\ncombined together make this the toughest\nand most iconic gravel race in the\nworld. And in a few days time, I'm going\nto be going elbow to elbow with some of\nthe world's best for the 200mile Pro\nRace. Well, this year, we've got more\ninternational competition than ever.\nThe route of Unbound. Well, 200 miles.\nI'm not sure how you sum that up in an\neasy way. We have them screaming up\nfront. It is now single file. They are\npinned. There's a lot of different\nsections to approach. Some are famous\nfor being really fast. Some are famous\nfor people notoriously having punctures\nnon-stop and some are just famous for\nbeing real tough, gritty sections.\nThe anticipation of today has been so\nintense. You just know that in the back\nof your mind, if it seems like it's all\nplain sailing for now, at that moment in\ntime, at some point it's going to get\ntough.\nSo, my goal coming to Unbound, I laid\nthis out on the line real early on, and\nthat was to come here to race for the\npros and push for a top 20. I would say\nthat even if right now you had 10hour\npower of 4 watts per kilo and you had an\nFTP of 5 1/2 watts per kilo, which I\nthink those are probably around the\nnumbers that you're looking at. Breaking\ninto the top 20 would be difficult.\nIt's been a big journey and progression\nall the way through ramping up my\ntraining, looking at the different\nelements of the bike, the terrain, all\nthe training that's led up to this. This\nis the final the final push. So, he's\ngoing into it with the best prep that he\ncould have done. And I think it's\nchallenged me both mentally and\nphysically\nmore than I was anticipating. Unbound is\nusually extremely hot and that will\nwreak havoc on your power late into the\nrace. That is kind of the critical\nmoment where people either completely\ncrack and fall back to, you know, 80th\nplace, 100th place, or break into that\ntop 20 or top 10.\nNow, in a few days time, I am going to\nbe going elbow to elbow with some of the\nworld's best in the 200mile pro men's\nrace. But Unbound isn't just for pro\nriders because shortly after the pro men\nand women set off, you've got the age\ngroupers who set off in hot pursuit.\nNow, before I get too excited about my\nrace, well, I'm missing two very\nimportant things. My bike and race\nnumber.\nIt should come as no surprise to hear\nthat I've gone all out on the bike front\nand as such I've got myself a very\nspecial setup to race on. And at the\nheart of it all is Shimano's GRX 12speed\nDi2 levers and rear derailia\ncomplemented with some Dura Ace road\ncomponents to help optimize my bike for\nthe crazy high speeds of the Pro Race.\nAs such, the gearing on this bike is\nsomething that people would be more\nfamiliar with on a road bike. 1134 to\nDura Ace cassette and then up front we\nhave a 3450 to Dura Ace power meter\nchain set. one that I most certainly did\nnot just have lying around spare. No,\nreally, because this, all of the other\ncomponents on this bike, and the Jura\nAC50 wheels are supplied courtesy of\nShimano, who are sponsoring this video,\nand it's thanks to their help that I'm\nout here in Emporia, able to take part\nin Unbound. In terms of some of the\nother details on this bike, well, my\nchain is waxed with Silka's Endurance\nchip wax. I've got my trusty Selarco 3D\nprinted saddle to peique carbon bottle\ncages. I've got my Wahoo Rome 3 up\nfront. I've got my Insta 360 action cam.\nAll my spares are packed deep inside of\nthe frame. I've got 50 mil Pirelli\nCurrato Gravel H tires. And then in\nterms of the frame and fork, well, if\nyou'd like to know more details about\nthat, well, I'm afraid I can't tell you\ncuz currently it's top secret. So, when\nthe time is right, we will have a video\ntelling you all of the things that you\nneed to know about it. So, subscribe to\nGCN and GCN Tech and turn on your\nnotifications because I'll also tell you\nthe story behind this incredible\ncustom paint job that I've got. Also,\nhave have you noticed uh got Alex\nwritten on it here, here, and up front\non the forks.\nTell me that's not blue and cool.\nI've gone all out on my setup and as\nsuch, Rule 28 have given me the fastest\ngravel race suit they make in a custom\nGCN design. In fact, it's one of the\nonly times you'll ever see me not in the\nfamous GCN red.\n[Applause]\nHi. Hi, Kai.\nHello. You okay? Yeah, good. Just\ndriving down to the start. Good. I think\nI'm all ready to race. I think I think\nit's all good to go. Yeah, I'm starting\nto feel I feel like uh I'm starting to\nfeel a little bit nervous now, but not\ntoo bad.\njust like the anticipation of it and\nthen once you get going it'll be good.\nYeah, I think so. It seems pretty mild\nto think like going to start a 200 mile\nbike race. Yeah.\nUm it's like when we were at Big Sugar\nand then it's that like anticipation and\nthen when you get there it's all like\neven though it's like pitch black like\nlots of activity and stuff going on.\nIt's quite cool. Yeah. I'm pretty\nbuzzing for it. So yeah, main thing is I\njust hope it all goes like smoothly\nreally. Okay. Yeah. Well, good luck and\nyeah, I hope it all goes well and um\nyeah, let's speak to you at the end.\nRight. Good luck. Stay safe. Right. Love\nyou lots. Bye. Love you too. Bye bye.\nIt's getting real now. And it looks like\npeople are starting to line up. So we\nneed to push forward to the front.\nRight. See you on the grip.\nare starting to kick in now. It's all\nstarting to feel pretty real.\nOh boy, what a start. We survived that.\nPerfect race section.\nThis is wild.\nI can't believe I'm doing this. The\ntanks are going. I'm following\nIs this mental?\nHow am I going to pay for it later on?\nThe way that the start panned out, like\nevery bike race is absolute carnage.\nBikes, bodies, people everywhere. In my\nhead, what I was thinking was, it's\ngoing to be incredible to make it to the\nfront of the bike race. Even if I wasn't\ngoing to stay there for long, that was\nmy goal was to get involved, be in the\nmix, and it went to plan. Okay, the\nadrenaline is starting to wear up now.\nIt's starting to get tough.\nBut I can see the front of the race.\nThe route for this year heads north and\nis known for being slightly hillier and\ntougher than the south, but thankfully\nless muddy should it rain. From Emporia,\nwe travel north for 70 mi to the first\ncheckpoint in Alma, the most northerly\npoint of the route. The second half\nwiggles its way south where you have\ncheckpoint two at mile 148 in Council\nGrove before heading east for the last\n50 mi back into Emporia which luckily is\npredominantly downhill.\nThat was upwards of about 24 25 m an\nhour. And big talk was we saw a big\ngroup of roughly 15 riders separating\nvery early.\nDust, clouds flying everywhere, rocks\nflying everywhere. The sounds of being\ninside what's essentially a pelaton of\n200 riders or so is mind-blowing. Anyone\nthat has never experienced it before,\nit's like nothing you could ever\nimagine.\nI don't know how much money's worth of\nexpensive race bikes there. constantly\nagain rocks thrown into them and the\nnoise is off the charts. But it was\ngood. I'd survived. I'd dodged some\ncrashes. I'd stayed safe and then we\nsettled in. I say we settled in, but the\nfirst hour and a half, the average speed\nwas like 23, 24 miles an hour. Well, if\nthis group stays out in front, it could\nmake for some very interesting moves. It\nwas just like a pelon of riders. Attacks\nflying off left, right, and center. The\nlittle breakaway groups were formed. And\nthen the whole pelon would chase. Then\nit would happen again. And every single\ncorner I'm coming out of doing like 600\nwatts. Then you settle down. Then you're\ndoing 300 400 W sat in the wheels. Then\n600 watts again.\nEvery corner\n6 700 W. One big line is absolute war\nzone.\nAnd it did start to dawn on me once the\ninitial adrenaline worn off that I was\nlike, \"Hold on, we all seem to be riding\nabout as hard as everyone would ride for\nan hour an hour's race.\" And then I was\nlike, \"Well, we got 200 m to go.\"\nTurned through this town, turned left,\nand we went just up this little road\njust before it turned into this double\ntrack. And you knew something was coming\nbecause the pace lifted. All of a\nsudden, you went from being dusty to\ncovered in mud. You couldn't really see\nwhere you were going.\nHonestly, it was just carnage.\nAnd then the one guy who said to me,\n\"Watch out for this next bit. It's\nreally tricky.\" Crashed in front of me.\nHis\nbike's flying across in front of me,\ncartwheeling across. I slam the brakes\non cuz I'm stuck behind him. And then\none person was fast 2, three, four,\nfive, and I lost absolutely tons of\nplaces.\nThe chain's gone.\nRight, checking in. We are 2 hours in.\nAverage power 295 W. Average speed 24.9\nmiles an hour.\nThe race The race has smashed to pieces\nand I found myself a group. It's time to\nlock in. Training and preparation coming\ninto this event has been tough to say\nthe least. The sacrifices that I've made\nto try and do the training have been\nnothing crazy, but enough that gradually\nover time start to chip away at you. But\nI've not been in this journey alone.\nI've had the support of the GCN\ncommunity, the support of everyone in\nthe GCN office, but most importantly of\nall, I've had the support from Chloe, my\nwife, who\nwhilst I'm the person racing the event\nand it's an individual thing for me,\nshe's been pretty much by my side for\nthe entire way through this. I think\nAlex will cope really well with the\nrace. He's done all of the training and\nprep. like he's worked really hard for\nthe past 6 months plus. All of our spare\ntime outside of work is essentially\nconsumed by me trying to train as much\nas possible. Alex's preparation for the\nrace has been\nbusy.\nHe was setting alarms at like 4:00 in\nthe morning to go and do like an epic\nride. All of our spare time outside of\nwork is essentially consumed by me\ntrying to train as much as possible. And\nif Chloe didn't ride her bike with me, I\nthink she probably wouldn't have seen me\nvery much for the last 6 months. All the\ntraining has led up to this. This is the\nfinal the final push. So yeah, I think\nhe's going to smash it.\nI was sat there thinking, okay, so I've\ndropped back from what was the front of\nthe race. I've dropped back into the\nsort of second, third, maybe even fourth\ngroup, and this is still crazy hard. And\nI was\nI was kind of starting to struggle\nalready and we're hour and a half into\nthe race, but I sat tight and I was\nthinking at some point I'm going to need\nto back off again even though I've\nalready backed off from what was the\nfront of the race.\nAnd\nthen I don't quite want to say disaster\nstruck, but disaster struck.\nBig crash. I think I'm okay. I tried to\ngo from the right hand track dart across\nup over the ridge onto the left hand\ntrack and I just completely misjudged it\nand I wiped out hard. Let me show you my\nwar wounds.\nLeg, elbow, shoulder, hip.\nWe soldier on.\nCurrently, my mindset has turned to\nsurvival mode, but I'm sure we can get\nI'm sure we can get race mode back in a\nbit. Come on now.\nLong old day ahead.\nOh, man. Sorry.\nOkay.\nOkay. at this aid. 70 mi into the race.\nFocus strategy. Look at that. Smooth\nfrom Joan. Got another pack. He is\ntopped off, ready to go. Cam still\nlooking for his crew in the feed zone.\nWe're approaching the first feed now.\nIt's going to be quick pit stop. Check\nthem in one piece and away we go. My\nname's Chris. I'm one of the sport\nscientists at Precision. My job for the\nday is going to be crewing Alex out\nthere at the first and second\ncheckpoints, giving him all his\nnutrition, helping fix any bike issues\nhe's got, making sure he's ready to go.\nSo, he's going to be picking up some\ncaffeine gels, some PF62 bars and a few\nPF90s. We're aiming to keep it as brief\nas possible when he stops. He'll put\nboth feet down as he comes in. He'll\nhave thrown his pack on the floor, his\nempty one hopefully. He'll have ditch\nhis bottles at our feet. We'll load him\nup with a new pack straight away. Shove\ntwo new bottles in, stick some nutrition\neither in his uh jersey or shove it in\nthe hydration pack. Then we'll send him\non his way. Unless his bike needs some\nmud cleaning off it, in which case we'll\ngive it a quick quick spray and send him\noff.\nI had a massive get down. You okay\nthough? Yeah. The team from Precision\nFuel and Hydration were absolutely\nincredible. No, I'm fine, thank you.\nJust make sure my phone stays in my\npocket. They were so calm, cool, and\ncollected. I feel my eyes just really\nlike messed my like rhythm up. Bit of\nice if you want it. Do you want it down\nyour back? Front. You're okay. Good. Are\nwe loaded up? You're loaded up. You're\nready to go, mate. And before I know it,\nhydration bladder was out. Hydration\nbladder was in. Pocket stocked up, ready\nto go. And I was like, \"Cool. Um, yeah.\nHave I got everything then?\" And they\nwere like, \"It's done. What are you\nwaiting for? Go, go, go.\" Right. I think\nI'm in one piece, mate. Cheers, guys.\nThank you.\nPit stop one done. The crew are amazing\nand I'm on my way\nand I even leap frogged my little group.\nGives me a little breather. Happy days.\nMy head on and on until I blend.\nsuperstition.\nAnd then what happened over this next,\nlet's describe as the middle sector of\nthe race was\na roller coaster of emotions in terms of\nmy physical feelings and my mental\nstate. It's 10:00 a.m. and the sun has\ncome up and it's starting to get hot.\nNot too bad yet, but you can really feel\nit on your back.\nWe're in for a spicy one.\nMy car I'm riding buddies.\nHey guys.\nSo things started out great. We were\nmoving along at a nice pace. The group\nwe were with were working well. Everyone\nwas doing their turns. We didn't ride\ncrazy hard on the climbs. We rode at a\ngood tempo. And I think everyone knew\nthat we there was this sort of unspoken\nagreement that we're in this together.\nEveryone knows a long way to go. So,\nlet's keep a lid on it.\nOkay, we're over over halfway now. 102\nmiles in.\n5 hours 4 minutes.\nIt's going to be touch and go. We got\nunder 10 hours at this rate,\nbut I'm going to give it everything I\ngot.\nThe group had grown in size and we were\nabsolutely trucking along. We got caught\nby I think it was a group of three to\nfour riders\ncaught us from behind and these were\nessentially people that were really out\nof position within the race because they\nhad problems early on. That extra\nimpetus into our group all of a sudden\nfelt like someone had absolutely ramped\nup the speed.\nLeap of faith. We can do what we feel.\nStarting to struggle now. Really feeling\nit in the legs.\n30 something miles to the feed zone. Oh,\ncar.\nI'm getting dropped from my group.\nAh, and there goes the group. It's\nhappened.\nThe legs have gone.\n140 miles. We got 8 miles to get to the\nfeed,\npick up morale, extra food, and then I'm\ngoing to have to hang it out for another\n50 to the finish. So with the first part\nof the race being so crazy fast, you\nessentially forgot that you had the\nsmall chain ring. And it was only when I\napproached this mid phase of the race,\nhaving felt like I would been feeling\ngood and then feeling bad. And it was\nreally in those bad patches that I found\nmyself quickly and quite regularly\nreaching for the smaller chain ring to\ntry and look after my legs as best as\npossible, knowing that there's still a\nhell of a long way to go through this\nrace. One of the most frustrating things\nI could possibly think of has happened\nis I've been dropped from a group of 10\nriders and the route pretty much turned\nright and went in a straight line for\nabout 10 miles into a block headwind.\nMore headwind. Look at that\nnon-stop headwind. Ah, I'd gone from\nfeeling good to feeling bad to feeling\ngood. And then I was feeling bad again.\nAnd as we approached the second\ncheckpoint, which was at mile 147,\nI graveled into that checkpoint to be\nhonest.\nNo. Come on.\nYou're too late cuz you're hungry.\nGet that bladder in now. Get this on\nyour back.\nGoing for a bit of a bad patch, but\nyeah, this will cool you down, mate.\nYeah. Yonder.\nThank you. Thank you.\nIt's going to be cold. Yeah, it's good.\nThat's what you need at the moment.\nCooled off. Oh, look. Made my head. You\ngo. Oh, it's cold. Woo! Oh boy. Oh,\nit down the back there. Won't take long\nto melt. What way is it?\nNo, I'm good. Don't worry. I think we\ngot it. Come on.\nCheckpoint one done. Checkpoint two\ndone. I'm stocked up. I'm refueled. And\nthis is gonna take me all the way\nthrough to the finish.\nThis time is blazing down on us now.\nIt's uh it's tough.\nSo, in terms of my setup, this is\nsomething I obviously thought long and\nhard about coming into Unbound as a\ntotally self-confessed bike nerd. And I\nfeel like I got the choices right and I\nfeel happy with what I decided to use.\nOne of the things that I was thinking\nabout a lot before the race was what\nwheel set I would use. So I decided to\nchoose the Durace road wheel with a sort\nof nod more towards aerodynamics rather\nthan trying to use a wheel which was say\nmore optimized for wider tires. I\nprioritized aerodynamics over wider tire\nand wheel combinations. Basically,\nI got to sort of be honest here to\nmyself. Top 20, it's gone out the\nwindow. Unbound has beaten me when it\ncomes to a top 20. Top 30 out the\nwindow. Top 50, whilst I didn't know it,\nbut it was probably out the window. And\nI went from thinking\ninstead of trying to\naim for a position, I was like, I need\nto just do the best that I can do. I\nthought, let's try and get under 10\nhours for this thing. That's 200 m, 20\nmph average. That in itself is like off\nthe charts. That's an achievement that I\nthink I could still be proud of. So\nthat's what I aimed for.\nIf I want to stand any chance of\ncracking sub 10 hours,\nit's going to be touch and go. I think\nI'm going to have a tailwind for the\nlast bit. So,\nwish me luck. It's now turned into a\npersonal battle. Me versus Unbound.\nGot 20.6 miles to go. And if I want to\ngo under 10 hours, got exactly one hour\nto do it in.\nHead down. Let's go.\nTell you what, this has been\na roller coaster of emotions, highs,\nlows,\ncrashes, near-death experiences,\nand the end is in sight.\nNearly.\nI got to keep my game face on. No silly\nmistakes.\nIt's hurting so bad now.\nThink we can do it.\nLooks crossing the line there. Red Smith\nand Donald Madness.\nThat's the toughest thing I've ever\ndone. Yeah.\nGood. You've earned it then. That's\nenough to be suffering. Well done. That\nwas an epic epic day.\nReally well done. I think Unbound has\nbroken me. Yeah.\nYeah. Well, I finished,\nbut I feel like I've gone to battle.\nStay in my leg.\nDon't socks are coming white again.\nWell done. It's mindblowing to think\nthat people are out there not only\ncheering everybody on, but they've gone,\n\"We want to cheer for you.\" And it the\nnumber of people that I've seen around\nUnbound that shared their stories of how\nmuch they had enjoyed seeing the journey\nof my like progress through building to\nUnbound. It was like really humbling and\nI don't know, it's just a it's like a\nspecial feeling. And I think when you\ncombine all of that together and you\ncome through the finish line, you're\ntired, you're exhausted, and you think\nthat's it. It's done. And I just\nyou just lost words at the finish to be\nHaving crossed the finish line, knowing\nmy own time, my next thought was, how\nfast did the leaders go? In my head, I\nwas thinking I could be 45 minutes or so\nbehind first place based on last year's\nwinnings times. However, what I hadn't\nplanned for was for this to be another\nfastest Unbound ever. In the women's pro\nrace, Karolina Minion won in 10 hours 3\nminutes 54 seconds. Cameron Jones won\nthe pro men's race in 8 hours 37 minutes\nand 9 seconds, meaning I was 1 hour 16\nminutes behind the leader. What was my\nfirst reaction? Holy, that's fast. The\nstats for my performance though are\nstill pretty impressive. I did 200 miles\nwith an average speed of 20.3 mph, an\naverage power of 234 watt, a normalized\npower of 274 watt, average heart rate\n137 with a perceived effort, well,\nwithout a doubt, 10 out of 10. I also\ndropped my pal Dylan Johnson a message\nto let him know he was right all those\nmonths ago about a top 20 being out of\nreach for me. But you know what? I'm\ntotally cool with that. And while my\nbody might be beaten up and not working\nas well as it could, my bike setup\ndidn't skip a beat. No punctures, no\nmechanicals, and no issues to overcome.\nJust a boss setup that was an absolute\npleasure to ride. Well, there you go. I\ncan't believe I'm about to say this, but\nthat's Unbound 200 2025 done and dusted.\nIt's been an absolutely incredible\njourney to go right from the start\nthrough to the end. And to wrap this up\nin one video is an incredibly like\namazing experience, and one that I'm\nalways going to remember. I hope\neveryone at home has enjoyed it as well.\nBut what I do want to say is a massive\nthanks to everyone that has helped me\nthrough this because without you guys,\nit wouldn't be possible. Oh, like\nfirstly, thanks to the people that have\nhelped support this video and made it\npossible. Thanks to everyone at home\nthat has supported me on the way. And I\nguess more importantly than anyone else,\nI want to say thanks to Chloe, my wife,\nfor putting up with me all the way\nthrough this because without her\nsupport, I honestly don't think I could\nhave done it. So, there you go. Unbound\n2025 done and dusted. If you have\nenjoyed this video, please do give it a\nbig thumbs up. And um I'd really\nappreciate hearing your thoughts in the\ncomments section down below and I'll\nenjoy sitting and reading through those.\nRight, see you later. Just to confirm\nUnbound, I don't think I'm ever doing it\nagain.\n350 next year. There's no there's not\nenough money in the world for me to do\nthe 350.\nHonestly, there's not.\nYeah, mine burns.\nWe all agreed to have a little mini pit\nstop. That's that's gravel community for\nyou.",
