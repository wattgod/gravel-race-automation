Rural Michigan location means longer drives from major airports but eliminates urban traffic complications."

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "At 57 miles, Sheri noted settling \"into a pace I could hold for 57 miles\" using perceived exertion rather than power data. The distance splits fields across three options (16, 28, 57 miles), diluting the competitive field in the main event while accommodating recreational riders. More compact than Grinduro."

Less technical than The Mid South."

        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Despite the \"super flat\" reputation, Sheri encountered late-race climbs that were \"just steep enough to shatter our tired band of riders, with three getting spit off the back.\" The \"evil route creators\" placed hills at mile 52, but they're described as \"nothing crazy steep or long.\" Less climbing than The Mid South."

      "climate": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "September weather ranged from 43°F at the start to above 55°F during racing, with building crosswinds that Sheri described as battling \"Gale, who was working overtime with her evil sister Windy.\" Previous days had seen 20-30 mph winds, making race day conditions relatively favorable. More weather exposure than Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."
      },
      "altitude": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "St. Johns, Michigan sits at roughly 800 feet above sea level with zero altitude training benefit. The flat terrain through corn fields and apple orchards provides no meaningful elevation challenge beyond the modest rolling hills scattered throughout the 57-mile course. Lower altitude than Gravel Worlds — no thin-air concerns."
      },
      "adventure": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "The course winds through the \"wooded Saginaw/Gratiot Game Area\" before emerging into agricultural corridors. Riders finish \"through corn fields and apple orchards for the final leg,\" but the 99% dirt road format prioritizes speed over wilderness exploration in managed recreation areas."
      },
      "prestige": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Part of the Michigan Gravel Race Series with a regional reputation as one of \"the fastest gravel races in Michigan.\" Sheri compared the relaxed start to \"dealing with 1700 aggressive racers at Unbound Gravel,\" highlighting the local rather than national competitive scope."
      },
      "race_quality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Race director Dan Frazier \"always puts on a well-organized, challenging, safe, family-friendly, and fun event,\" according to returning riders. The 2025 field of \"almost 800 racers\" represents the largest in event history, though crashes from mud and corner speed remain concerns."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Post-race includes \"lunch after the race, 2 Uncle John's hard cider pours, a super cool finishers medal for everyone who finishes.\" The cider mill venue offers family activities while riders race, creating a festival atmosphere rather than pure competitive focus."
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "The event won multiple Fly Awards including \"Favorite Race Director\" and \"Favorite Overall Awards\" with nearly 800 participants in 2025. Sheri noted the supportive crowd gave her \"a hearty round of applause\" when she took the podium, creating an encouraging rather than intimidating atmosphere."
      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Sheri discovered she \"was the oldest woman racing the 57-mile course\" and had been \"riding all day with several 40-year-old women,\" suggesting limited age group depth. The regional Michigan field lacks the national-level talent that defines premier gravel events. Thinner field than Ouray Gravel Grinder."

        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Entry includes post-race meal, two hard cider pours, finisher medal, and access to Saturday's pre-race party with live music and food trucks. The family-friendly cider mill venue and rural Michigan pricing structure provide substantial value without premium event costs."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Registration runs $50-75. Rural Michigan location keeps accommodation costs reasonable compared to destination events, though longer drives from major airports add travel expenses. September timing avoids peak tourist seasons, and the agricultural setting provides budget lodging options for the regional field this attracts. Similar expense level to Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."
