Rural Michigan location means longer drives from major airports but eliminates urban traffic complications."
      },
      "length": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "At 57 miles, Sheri noted settling \"into a pace I could hold for 57 miles\" using perceived exertion rather than power data. The distance splits fields across three options (16, 28, 57 miles), diluting the competitive field in the main event while accommodating recreational riders. More compact than Grinduro."

Less technical than The Mid South."

      "climate": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "September weather ranged from 43°F at the start to above 55°F during racing, with building crosswinds that Sheri described as battling \"Gale, who was working overtime with her evil sister Windy.\" Previous days had seen 20-30 mph winds, making race day conditions relatively favorable. More weather exposure than Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."
      },
      "altitude": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "St. Johns, Michigan sits at roughly 800 feet above sea level with zero altitude training benefit. The flat terrain through corn fields and apple orchards provides no meaningful elevation challenge beyond the modest rolling hills scattered throughout the 57-mile course. Lower altitude than Gravel Worlds — no thin-air concerns."
      },
      "adventure": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "The course winds through the \"wooded Saginaw/Gratiot Game Area\" before emerging into agricultural corridors. Riders finish \"through corn fields and apple orchards for the final leg,\" but the 99% dirt road format prioritizes speed over wilderness exploration in managed recreation areas."
      },
      "prestige": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Part of the Michigan Gravel Race Series with a regional reputation as one of \"the fastest gravel races in Michigan.\" Sheri compared the relaxed start to \"dealing with 1700 aggressive racers at Unbound Gravel,\" highlighting the local rather than national competitive scope."
      },
      "race_quality": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Race director Dan Frazier \"always puts on a well-organized, challenging, safe, family-friendly, and fun event,\" according to returning riders. The 2025 field of \"almost 800 racers\" represents the largest in event history, though crashes from mud and corner speed remain concerns."
      },
      "experience": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "Post-race includes \"lunch after the race, 2 Uncle John's hard cider pours, a super cool finishers medal for everyone who finishes.\" The cider mill venue offers family activities while riders race, creating a festival atmosphere rather than pure competitive focus."
      },
      "community": {
        "score": 2,
        "explanation": "The event won multiple Fly Awards including \"Favorite Race Director\" and \"Favorite Overall Awards\" with nearly 800 participants in 2025. Sheri noted the supportive crowd gave her \"a hearty round of applause\" when she took the podium, creating an encouraging rather than intimidating atmosphere."
      },
      "field_depth": {
        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Sheri discovered she \"was the oldest woman racing the 57-mile course\" and had been \"riding all day with several 40-year-old women,\" suggesting limited age group depth. The regional Michigan field lacks the national-level talent that defines premier gravel events. Thinner field than Ouray Gravel Grinder."

        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "Entry includes post-race meal, two hard cider pours, finisher medal, and access to Saturday's pre-race party with live music and food trucks. The family-friendly cider mill venue and rural Michigan pricing structure provide substantial value without premium event costs."
      },
      "expenses": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Registration runs $50-75. Rural Michigan location keeps accommodation costs reasonable compared to destination events, though longer drives from major airports add travel expenses. September timing avoids peak tourist seasons, and the agricultural setting provides budget lodging options for the regional field this attracts. Similar expense level to Belgian Waffle Ride San Diego."

Attack. Attack.\n&gt;&gt; Ride hard, have fun, and thank you for\nracing with us at the Uncle John's\ngravel race.\nThat is awesome.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, like\nPlease\nfollow your tax.\nBy the dawn's early light, what so\nproudly we hailed\nfor the land\nof the free\nand the home\nof The praise\nfor\nWhat do\n&gt;&gt; you got there? Some apple cider.\n&gt;&gt; Is there some alcohol in that?\n&gt;&gt; I don't know. I haven't had one yet.\n[Applause]\n&gt;&gt; I'm thirsty.\n&gt;&gt; Well earned cider\nfor Mr. Third place, Matt.

My age group.\n&gt;&gt; And then overall\n25th.\n&gt;&gt; Pretty good on it. That's a lot of\npeople.\nLot of people as you can see.\nI need that license plate.\nThird place, Asad. In second place,\nCraig Carroll.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's there's some sweet bike\nmuseums in Dayton if you want to go\nthere.\nYou know, the Wright brothers started in\nbicycle before planes.\n&gt;&gt; Good day.\n3 and 1/2 hour car ride home. What a day\nthough. We did pretty well.\nUm\nthe start was pretty hectic. Uh we tried\nto get up close to the front, but they\nwanted you to line up based on your\naverage speeds. Uh hindsight, we should\nhave just lined up with the 22 plus mph.\nUm but we missed the split early on of\nthe neutral rule out. Uh the guy that\nwon on the fat bike, kudos to him. He\naccelerated. I was already at 25 miles\nan hour and I'm thinking we got 56 more\nmiles to go of this. Uh so but he made\nthat group and that was the difference\nthe rest of the race. Uh we had a really\ngood group. It kind of went to hell on\nthe way back in with the wind. But Josh\nand I were really pushing the way in and\nuh\nrocks were flying. One hit Josh in the\neye. Luckily he had his sunglasses on.\nThe other one sadly\ntook out my GoPro. I mean, hit the whole\nGoPro, broke it off the handlebar mount.\nSo, all the video is gone and there's no\nway it was going to find that thing. It\nwas at the 30 m mark or 32.5 mile mark.\nSomebody finds it, great. But, um,\nwe ordered a new GoPro on the way home,\nso that's all good. At least I took some\nfootage after that. Just a couple\nsnippets of the race, but\nwoo, second place, not too bad. 20.1\naverage. Great job to Dan and Co at\nUncle John's. Pretty cool race.\nAnd uh we'll see you next week. Thanks\nfor watching.\nHeat. Heat.",

SUBSCRIBE for free WATTS 👉 https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsr-SU_SAqjrzmu4kXIRfUQ?sub_confirmation=1\n\nUncle John’s Dirty Ride is a gravel race across the flat, fast, dirt roads of Gratiot County, Michigan. Utilizing the Uncle John’s Cider Mill grounds as the start/finish, the course traverses through the Saginaw/Gratiot Game Area, farm backroads lined with cornfields and 99% on dirt roads. This race took place on September 8th, 2023, in St. John's, MI.\n\nI raced the 56 mile route as part of the Michigan Gravel Race Series (MGRS) the \"Long\" course. I had low expectations for this race since I had raced the day before (Lord of the Springs) on my mountain bike and had a crash that left me with a bruise on my thigh and sore wrist.  So for this race my goal was to just sit in the pack and try to stay with the front group as long as possible. \n\nI felt sore in the morning, but by the time the race started I was feeling race ready. I got a bit ambitious early trying to ensure I was in any break and chased down too many attacks. This was foolish as after a surging first half hour, I eventually popped and couldn't hold onto the lead group of about 15.  I eventually settled back to a large chase group. This was exactly what I needed as the pace was pretty chill. I was able to win the group sprint at the end, good enough for 2nd place in my age group and 16th overall. \n\n👉 Hey!

Key challenges include flying rocks around mile 32.5 that can damage equipment and hit riders, and a brutal final climb that catches riders off guard. The race distance runs longer than advertised, with the 24-mile option actually closer to 26 miles. Weather conditions include overcast skies with light drizzle. The event draws large fields of 450+ riders and features excellent organization with good support throughout. Post-race festivities include hard cider, fresh donuts, and food trucks at Uncle John's Cider Mill, creating a welcoming community atmosphere for both new and experienced gravel racers."
