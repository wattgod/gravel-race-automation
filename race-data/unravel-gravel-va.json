        "score": 1,
        "explanation": "Elite racing now features \"the world's best riders, squeezing gravel races in between spring classics and Grand Tours\" according to Gran Fondo Magazine. A 200-rider state championship doesn't attract that caliber of competition."

        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "Elite racers use \"custom builds\" and \"perfect setups\" as Gran Fondo notes, but Virginia locations avoid resort-town pricing. The main expense challenge is the venue uncertainty making lodging reservations difficult until course confirmation."
